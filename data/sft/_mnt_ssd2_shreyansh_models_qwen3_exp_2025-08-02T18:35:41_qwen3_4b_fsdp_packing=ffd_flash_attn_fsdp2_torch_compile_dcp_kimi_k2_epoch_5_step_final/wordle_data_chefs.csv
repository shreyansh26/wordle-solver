For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""AUDIO"" are popular choices. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- L is not in the word
- A is not the word

- No L, A, or T
- No repeated letters (since every letter was either present or absent)

We need a word that:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)

   - L, A, T are not in the word
   - E is in the word but not in position 5

   - R, B, U are not in the word
   - E is in the word but not in position 2
   - S is in the word and is in position 5 (✓)

Combining these facts:

- Letters known to be in the word: S (position 5), E (positions 1-4)
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, A, T, R, B, U
- Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y
- Remaining vowels: I, O (since A is out and E is already confirmed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible patterns: _ _ _ E S or _ _ E _ S, etc.

Let’s look for words ending in S with E somewhere in the first four letters, avoiding all the excluded letters.

Candidate words:
- ""WESER"" – but R is excluded
- ""NEXES"" – X is uncommon and E is repeated
- ""MUSES"" – U is excluded
- ""PIES"" is too short
- ""DISES"" – not a valid word
- ""FUSES"" – U is excluded
- ""GENSE"" – not a valid word
- ""HENSE"" – not a valid word
- ""KESSE"" – not a valid word
- ""PESOS"" – O is allowed, but PESOS has O and S is in position 5, E is in position 2
   - P E S O S: E is in position 2 (allowed), S is in position 5 (correct), but O is allowed, and P is allowed
   - However, we have not ruled out O yet, and P is allowed
   - But let’s check if this is a valid word: YES, PESOS is valid

But we should avoid any words that use excluded letters. Since PESOS uses P, E, S, O, S, and none of these are excluded except S is already confirmed.

Wait, let me re-examine:
- P: not excluded
- E: confirmed
- S: confirmed
- O: not excluded
- S: confirmed

This seems valid. However, let me think if there's a better word.

Another candidate: ""WESER"" – but R is excluded
Another: ""MUSES"" – U excluded
Another: ""PIES"" – too short
Another: ""CENSE"" – C, E, N, S, E – but N is allowed, C is allowed, E is allowed, S is allowed, and this ends with E, but we need to end with S
Wait, we need to end with S, so ""CENSE"" is invalid

Let me think systematically:
We need _ _ _ _ S with E in positions 1-4, and letters not in {L,A,T,R,B,U}

Possible letters left: C,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,N,O,P,V,W,Y plus E and S

But OESIS is a valid word (a rhetorical figure), but let me check:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""AUDIO"" are popular choices. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- L is not in the word
- A is not the word
- T is not the word
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- The word has S somewhere (positions 2-5)
- The word has E somewhere (positions 1-4)
- No L, A, or T
- No repeated letters (since every letter was either present or absent)

We need a word that:
1. Contains both S and E
2. Does not contain L, A, T
3. S is not in position 1, E is not in position 5

Good candidates might use remaining common letters like R, N, I, O, C, H, etc. Let's try ""SERFS"":
- S in position 1: but feedback says S is not in position 1 → invalid
Next: ""REBUS"":
- R, E, B, U, S
- E is in position 2 (valid), S is in position 5 (valid)
- No L, A, T
- All letters unique
- This seems valid

Guess 2: REBUS -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(-) B(x) U(x) S(✓)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1
   - L, A, T are not in the word
   - E is in the word but not in position 5

2. REBUS → R(x) E(-) B(x) U(x) S(✓)
   - R, B, U are not in the word
   - E is in the word but not in position 2
   - S is in the word and is in position 5 (✓)

Combining these facts:

- Letters known to be in the word: S (position 5), E (positions 1-4)
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, A, T, R, B, U
- Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y
- Remaining vowels: I, O (since A is out and E is already confirmed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible patterns: _ _ _ E S or _ _ E _ S, etc.

Let’s look for words ending in S with E somewhere in the first four letters, avoiding all the excluded letters.

Candidate words:
- ""WESER"" – but R is excluded
- ""NEXES"" – X is uncommon and E is repeated
- ""MUSES"" – U is excluded
- ""PIES"" is too short
- ""DISES"" – not a valid word
- ""FUSES"" – U is excluded
- ""GENSE"" – not a valid word
- ""HENSE"" – not a valid word
- ""KESSE"" – not a valid word
- ""PESOS"" – O is allowed, but PESOS has O and S is in position 5, E is in position 2
   - P E S O S: E is in position 2 (allowed), S is in position 5 (correct), but O is allowed, and P is allowed
   - However, we have not ruled out O yet, and P is allowed
   - But let’s check if this is a valid word: YES, PESOS is valid

But we should avoid any words that use excluded letters. Since PESOS uses P, E, S, O, S, and none of these are excluded except S is already confirmed.

Wait, let me re-examine:
- P: not excluded
- E: confirmed
- S: confirmed
- O: not excluded
- S: confirmed

This seems valid. However, let me think if there's a better word.

Another candidate: ""WESER"" – but R is excluded
Another: ""MUSES"" – U excluded
Another: ""PIES"" – too short
Another: ""CENSE"" – C, E, N, S, E – but N is allowed, C is allowed, E is allowed, S is allowed, and this ends with E, but we need to end with S
Wait, we need to end with S, so ""CENSE"" is invalid

Let me think systematically:
We need _ _ _ _ S with E in positions 1-4, and letters not in {L,A,T,R,B,U}

Possible letters left: C,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,N,O,P,V,W,Y plus E and S

Let’s try ""WESPS"" – but W,E,S,P,S – but S is repeated, and P is allowed, but WESPS is not a valid word
""WES"" is a prefix but not a word
""WESER"" is a river, but R is excluded
""OESIS"" – but ends with S? No, ends with S? OESIS ends with S? No, OESIS ends with S? Wait, OESIS is 5 letters: O E S I S – ends with S, but I is allowed
But OESIS is a valid word (a rhetorical figure), but let me check:
- O: allowed
- E: allowed
- S: allowed
- I: allowed
- S: allowed
And positions:
- S is in position 3 (but we know S must be in position 5)
So this is invalid

Let me try ""CENSE"" – but ends with E, not S
""CENSE"" is C E N S E – ends with E, invalid
""SENSE"" – S E N S E – ends with E, invalid
""VENSE"" – V E N S E – ends with E, invalid
""WENSE"" – not a word
""YENSE"" – not a word

Let me try ""PESOS"" – P E S O S
- P: allowed
- E: allowed
- S: confirmed in position 5
- O: allowed
- S: confirmed
And E is in position 2 (allowed)
This seems valid

Another candidate: ""FESSE"" – but F E S S E – ends with E, invalid
""FESS"" is 4 letters
""FES"" is 3 letters

""KESSE"" – not a word
""YES"" is 3 letters

""PIES"" is 4 letters

""DOSES"" – D O S E S – ends with S, E is in position 4 (allowed), S is in position 5 (correct), letters D, O, S, E are all allowed
DOSES is a valid word

Between PESOS and DOSES, DOSES seems more common

Let me check DOSES:
- D: allowed
- O: allowed
- S: confirmed in position 5
- E: in position 4 (allowed)
- S: confirmed
And letters D, O, S, E are all allowed
This seems valid

I think DOSES is a good next guess

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""AUDIO"" are popular choices. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- L is not in the word
- A is not the word
- T is not the word
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- The word has S somewhere (positions 2-5)
- The word has E somewhere (positions 1-4)
- No L, A, or T
- No repeated letters (since every letter was either present or absent)

We need a word that:
1. Contains both S and E
2. Does not contain L, A, T
3. S is not in position 1, E is not in position 5

Good candidates might use remaining common letters like R, N, I, O, C, H, etc. Let's try ""SERFS"":
- S in position 1: but feedback says S is not in position 1 → invalid
Next: ""REBUS"":
- R, E, B, U, S
- E is in position 2 (valid), S is in position 5 (valid)
- No L, A, T
- All letters unique

Possible patterns: _ _ _ E S or _ _ E _ S, etc.

Let’s look for words ending in S with E somewhere in the first four letters, avoiding all the excluded letters.

Candidate words:
- ""WESER"" – but R is excluded
- ""NEXES"" – X is uncommon and E is repeated
- ""MUSES"" – U is excluded
- ""PIES"" is too short
- ""DISES"" – not a valid word
- ""FUSES"" – U is excluded
- ""GENSE"" – not a valid word
- ""HENSE"" – not a valid word
- ""KESSE"" – not a valid word
- ""PESOS"" – O is allowed, but PESOS has O and S is in position 5, E is in position 2
   - P E S O S: E is in position 2 (allowed), S is in position 5 (correct), but O is allowed, and P is allowed
   - However, we have not ruled out O yet, and P is allowed
   - But let’s check if this is a valid word: YES, PESOS is valid

But we should avoid any words that use excluded letters. Since PESOS uses P, E, S, O, S, and none of these are excluded except S is already confirmed.

Wait, let me re-examine:
- P: not excluded
- E: confirmed
- S: confirmed
- O: not excluded
- S: confirmed

This seems valid. However, let me think if there's a better word.

Another candidate: ""WESER"" – but R is excluded
Another: ""MUSES"" – U excluded
Another: ""PIES"" – too short
Another: ""CENSE"" – C, E, N, S, E – but N is allowed, C is allowed, E is allowed, S is allowed, and this ends with E, but we need to end with S
Wait, we need to end with S, so ""CENSE"" is invalid

Let me think systematically:
We need _ _ _ _ S with E in positions 1-4, and letters not in {L,A,T,R,B,U}

Possible letters left: C,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,N,O,P,V,W,Y plus E and S

Let’s try ""WESPS"" – but W,E,S,P,S – but S is repeated, and P is allowed, but WESPS is not a valid word
""WES"" is a prefix but not a word
""WESER"" is a river, but R is excluded
""OESIS"" – but ends with S? No, ends with S? OESIS ends with S? No, OESIS ends with S? Wait, OESIS is 5 letters: O E S I S – ends with S, but I is allowed
But OESIS is a valid word (a rhetorical figure), but let me check:
- O: allowed
- E: allowed
- S: allowed
- I: allowed
- S: allowed
And positions:
- S is in position 3 (but we know S must be in position 5)
So this is invalid

Let me try ""CENSE"" – but ends with E, not S
""CENSE"" is C E N S E – ends with E, invalid
""SENSE"" – S E N S E – ends with E, invalid
""VENSE"" – V E N S E – ends with E, invalid
""WENSE"" – not a word
""YENSE"" – not a word

Let me try ""PESOS"" – P E S O S
- P: allowed
- E: allowed
- S: confirmed in position 5
- O: allowed
- S: confirmed
And E is in position 2 (allowed)
This seems valid

Another candidate: ""FESSE"" – but F E S S E – ends with E, invalid
""FESS"" is 4 letters
""FES"" is 3 letters

""KESSE"" – not a word
""YES"" is 3 letters

""PIES"" is 4 letters

""DOSES"" – D O S E S – ends with S, E is in position 4 (allowed), S is in position 5 (correct), letters D, O, S, E are all allowed
DOSES is a valid word

Between PESOS and DOSES, DOSES seems more common

Let me check DOSES:
- D: allowed
- O: allowed
- S: confirmed in position 5
- E: in position 4 (allowed)
- S: confirmed
And letters D, O, S, E are all allowed
This seems valid

I think DOSES is a good next guess

Let’s update what we now know after three guesses.

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   – S is in the word but not in position 1
   – L, A, T are not in the word
   – E is in the word but not in position 5

2. REBUS → R(x) E(-) B(x) U(x) S(✓)
   – R, B, U are not in the word
   – E is in the word but not in position 2
   – S is in the word and is in position 5 (✓)

3. DOSES → D(x) O(x) S(-) E(-) S(✓)
   – D, O are not in the word
   – S is in the word but not in position 3
   – E is in the word but not in position 4
   – S is in the word and is in position 5 (✓)

Combining all:

- Letters known to be in the word: S (position 5), E (positions 1, 3, or 4)
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, A, T, R, B, U, D, O
- Remaining common consonants: C, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y
- Remaining vowels: I (since A, O are out and E is already confirmed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S
- Contains E in position 1, 3, or 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ _ S
- _ E _ _ S
- _ _ E _ S

Let’s look for valid words fitting these patterns.

Pattern 1: E _ _ _ S
E _ _ _ S with remaining letters: C, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y
Possible: EINHS – not a word
EINHS – invalid
EINHS – no valid word

Pattern 2: _ E _ _ S
Possible: C E N T S – but T is excluded
F E N C S – not a word
G E N E S – G E N E S – GENE S? GENE S is not a word
H E N C S – not a word
M E N C S – not a word
P E N C S – not a word
V E N C S – not a word
W E N C S – not a word
Y E N C S – not a word

Pattern 3: _ _ E _ S
Possible: C H E E S – C H E E S – C H E E S is valid
Check letters: C, H, E, E, S
- C, H, E, S are all allowed
- S is in position 5 (correct)
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
This seems valid

Another candidate: F E E S – too short
G E E S – too short
H E E S – H E E S is valid
Check: H, E, E, S
- H, E, S are allowed
- S in position 5 (correct)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
This is also valid

Between CHEES and HEE S, CHEES is more common

Let me check CHEES:
C H E E S
- C: allowed
- H: allowed
- E: allowed
- E: allowed
- S: allowed
- S is in position 5 (correct)
- E is in position 3 (allowed)

This seems the best next guess

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""AUDIO"" are popular choices. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- L is not in the word
- A is not the word
- T is not the word
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- The word has S somewhere (positions 2-5)
- The word has E somewhere (positions 1-4)
- No L, A, or T
- No repeated letters (since every letter was either present or absent)

We need a word that:
1. Contains both S and E
2. Does not contain L, A, T
3. S is not in position 1, E is not in position 5

Good candidates might use remaining common letters like R, N, I, O, C, H, etc. Let's try ""SERFS"":
- S in position 1: but feedback says S is not in position 1 → invalid
Next: ""REBUS"":
- R, E, B, U, S
- E is in position 2 (valid), S is in position 5 (valid)
- No L, A, T
- All letters unique
- This seems valid

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1
   - L, A, T are not in the word
   - E is in the word but not in position 5

2. REBUS → R(x) E(-) B(x) U(x) S(✓)
   - R, B, U are not in the word
   - E is in the word but not in position 2
   - S is in the word and is in position 5 (✓)

Combining these facts:

- Letters known to be in the word: S (position 5), E (positions 1-4)
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, A, T, R, B, U
- Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y
- Remaining vowels: I, O (since A is out and E is already confirmed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible patterns: _ _ _ E S or _ _ E _ S, etc.

Let’s look for words ending in S with E somewhere in the first four letters, avoiding all the excluded letters.

Candidate words:
- ""WESER"" – but R is excluded
- ""NEXES"" – X is uncommon and E is repeated
- ""MUSES"" – U is excluded
- ""PIES"" is too short
- ""DISES"" – not a valid word
- ""FUSES"" – U is excluded
- ""GENSE"" – not a valid word
- ""HENSE"" – not a valid word
- ""KESSE"" – not a valid word
- ""PESOS"" – O is allowed, but PESOS has O and S is in position 5, E is in position 2
   - P E S O S: E is in position 2 (allowed), S is in position 5 (correct), but O is allowed, and P is allowed
   - However, we have not ruled out O yet, and P is allowed
   - But let’s check if this is a valid word: YES, PESOS is valid

But we should avoid any words that use excluded letters. Since PESOS uses P, E, S, O, S, and none of these are excluded except S is already confirmed.

Wait, let me re-examine:
- P: not excluded
- E: confirmed
- S: confirmed
- O: not excluded
- S: confirmed

This seems valid. However, let me think if there's a better word.

Another candidate: ""WESER"" – but R is excluded
Another: ""MUSES"" – U excluded
Another: ""PIES"" – too short
Another: ""CENSE"" – C, E, N, S, E – but N is allowed, C is allowed, E is allowed, S is allowed, and this ends with E, but we need to end with S
Wait, we need to end with S, so ""CENSE"" is invalid

Let me think systematically:
We need _ _ _ _ S with E in positions 1-4, and letters not in {L,A,T,R,B,U}

Possible letters left: C,D,F,G,H,I,K,M,N,O,P,V,W,Y plus E and S

Let’s try ""WESPS"" – but W,E,S,P,S – but S is repeated, and P is allowed, but WESPS is not a valid word
""WES"" is a prefix but not a word
""WESER"" is a river, but R is excluded
""OESIS"" – but ends with S? No, ends with S? OESIS ends with S? No, OESIS ends with S? Wait, OESIS is 5 letters: O E S I S – ends with S, but I is allowed
But OESIS is a valid word (a rhetorical figure), but let me check:
- O: allowed
- E: allowed
- S: allowed
- I: allowed
- S: allowed
And positions:
- S is in position 3 (but we know S must be in position 5)
So this is invalid

Let me try ""CENSE"" – but ends with E, not S
""CENSE"" is C E N S E – ends with E, invalid
""SENSE"" – S E N S E – ends with E, invalid
""VENSE"" – V E N S E – ends with E, invalid
""WENSE"" – not a word
""YENSE"" – not a word

Let me try ""PESOS"" – P E S O S
- P: allowed
- E: allowed
- S: confirmed in position 5
- O: allowed
- S: confirmed
And E is in position 2 (allowed)
This seems valid

Another candidate: ""FESSE"" – but F E S S E – ends with E, invalid
""FESS"" is 4 letters
""FES"" is 3 letters

""KESSE"" – not a word
""YES"" is 3 letters

""PIES"" is 4 letters

""DOSES"" – D O S E S – ends with S, E is in position 4 (allowed), S is in position 5 (correct), letters D, O, S, E are all allowed
DOSES is a valid word

Between PESOS and DOSES, DOSES seems more common

Let me check DOSES:
- D: allowed
- O: allowed
- S: confirmed in position 5
- E: in position 4 (allowed)
- S: confirmed
And letters D, O, S, E are all allowed
This seems valid

I think DOSES is a good next guess

Let’s update what we now know after three guesses.

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   – S is in the word but not in position 1
   – L, A, T are not in the word
   – E is in the word but not in position 5

2. REBUS → R(x) E(-) B(x) U(x) S(✓)
   – R, B, U are not in the word
   – E is in the word but not in position 2
   – S is in the word and is in position 5 (✓)

3. DOSES → D(x) O(x) S(-) E(-) S(✓)
   – D, O are not in the word
   – S is in the word but not in position 3
   – E is in the word but not in position 4
   – S is in the word and is in position 5 (✓)

Combining all:

- Letters known to be in the word: S (position 5), E (positions 1, 3, or 4)
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, A, T, R, B, U, D, O
- Remaining common consonants: C, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y
- Remaining vowels: I (since A, O are out and E is already confirmed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S
- Contains E in position 1, 3, or 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ _ S
- _ E _ _ S
- _ _ E _ S

Let’s look for valid words fitting these patterns.

Pattern 1: E _ _ _ S
E _ _ _ S with remaining letters: C, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y
Possible: EINHS – not a word
EINHS – invalid
EINHS – no valid word

Pattern 2: _ E _ _ S
Possible: C E N T S – but T is excluded
F E N C S – not a word
G E N E S – G E N E S – GENE S? GENE S is not a word
H E N C S – not a word
M E N C S – not a word
P E N C S – not a word
V E N C S – not a word
W E N C S – not a word
Y E N C S – not a word

Pattern 3: _ _ E _ S
Possible: C H E E S – C H E E S – C H E E S is valid
Check letters: C, H, E, E, S
- C, H, E, S are all allowed
- S is in position 5 (correct)
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
This seems valid

Another candidate: F E E S – too short
G E E S – too short
H E E S – H E E S is valid
Check: H, E, E, S
- H, E, S are allowed
- S in position 5 (correct)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
This is also valid

Between CHEES and HEE S, CHEES is more common

Let me check CHEES:
C H E E S
- C: allowed
- H: allowed
- E: allowed
- E: allowed
- S: allowed
- S is in position 5 (correct)
- E is in position 3 (allowed)

This seems the best next guess

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on CHEES:

C(✓)  H(✓)  E(✓)  E(-)  S(✓)

What this tells us:
- C is in position 1 (✓)
- H is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 3 (✓)
- The last E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since it’s marked “-”)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

So the word is now:

C H E _ S

with the fourth letter being any letter that:
- has not been ruled out yet
- is not E (because the E in position 4 is marked “-”)

Letters already ruled out: L, A, T, R, B, U, D, O, plus any others used in previous guesses (C, H, E, S are already placed).

Remaining possible consonants for position 4: F, G, I, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit C H E _ S:

- CHEFS – C H E F S (valid, but F is uncommon)
- CHEWS – C H E W S (valid)
- CHEKS – not a word
- CHEMS – not a word
- CHENS – not a word
- CHEPS – not a word
- CHEVS – not a word
- CHEYS – not a word

Between CHEFS and CHEWS, CHEWS is more common.

Let’s go with CHEWS.
