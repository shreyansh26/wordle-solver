### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel in English

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
  Since E is in the 5th position in SLATE and marked “wrong position”, the secret word must contain E somewhere in positions 1-4.

We now know:
- No S, L, A, T.
- The word must contain E (not in the 5th spot).

To maximize information on the next guess, I’ll pick a word with:
- E in a new position (1-4).
- Other common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.

A good candidate is “MONEY”:
- M, N, O, Y are all untested letters.
- E is in position 4 (new position).
- It uses common letters and avoids the ruled-out ones.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, M, O
- Letters definitely in the word: N (position 3) and Y (position 5)
- Letter E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (from MONEY feedback), so E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
  However, position 3 is already taken by N, so E must be in position 1 or 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in position 3.
2. Has Y in position 5.
3. Contains E in position 1 or 2.
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, L, A, T, M, O).

Possible patterns:
- E _ N _ Y  (E in position 1)
- _ E N _ Y  (E in position 2)

Let’s try “ENTRY”:
- E in position 1 (new position for E)
- N in position 3 (confirmed)
- T is already ruled out (from SLATE feedback), so ENTRY is invalid.

Next, try “HENNY”:
- H, E, N, N, Y
- N in position 3 (confirmed)
- Y in position 5 (confirmed)
- E in position 2 (new position for E)
- H is untested
- Second N is allowed (no info against duplicates)

“HENNY” satisfies all constraints.
