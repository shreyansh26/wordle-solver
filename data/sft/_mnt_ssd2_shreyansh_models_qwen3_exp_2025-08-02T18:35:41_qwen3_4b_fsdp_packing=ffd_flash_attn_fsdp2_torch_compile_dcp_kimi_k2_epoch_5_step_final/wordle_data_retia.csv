For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it uses 5 of the most common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and covers both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N). This gives us a good baseline to work from.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- The word contains R, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively)
- The word does NOT contain C or N
- Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses R, A, E in different positions
- Does not use C or N
- Uses only the remaining 22 letters (excluding C, N)

A good strategy is to place R, A, E in new positions and fill the other two slots with common letters not yet eliminated (like S, T, L, O, I, etc.).

Let’s try: STARE
- S is a new letter we haven’t tested yet
- T is a new letter we haven’t tested yet
- A is in position 2 (new position)
- R is in position 3 (new position)
- E is in position 5 (but E was NOT in position 5 in CRANE, so this is invalid)

We cannot have E in position 5. Let’s try: STARE → E in 5 is invalid.

Next option: TEARS
- T is new
- E is in position 1 (new position)
- A is in position 2 (new position)
- R is in position 3 (new position)
- S is new
This uses all three known letters (R, A, E) in new positions and introduces two new letters (T, S).

Let’s check:
- R is in position 3 (was in 2 in CRANE → valid)
- A is in position 2 (was in 3 in CRANE → valid)
- E is in position 1 (was in 5 in CRANE → valid)
- T and S are new letters

This seems like a good second guess.

Let's summarize what we know so far.

Letters we know are in the word:
- E is in position 2 (✓ from TEARS)
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3
- T is in the word but NOT in position 1
- S is NOT in the word (x from TEARS)
- C and N are NOT in the word (from CRANE)

So far we have:
- _ E _ _ _
- R must be in 1, 4, or 5
- A must be in 1, 4, or 5 (and different from R)
- T must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 2 is E), so 3, 4, or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2
2. Contains R and A in positions 1, 4, or 5 (not overlapping)
3. Contains T in positions 3, 4, or 5
4. Does not contain C, N, or S

Let's try to place R and A first.

Option 1:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Positions 4 and 5: need to be filled with letters not yet used (not C, N, S)

Word: R E T _ _

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. Common letters left: D, L, I, O, M, etc.

Possible words:
- RETID (but I and D are ok)
- RETIA (but A is already used)
- RETRO (but O is ok)
- RETIA is invalid (A is in position 4, but A can be in 4)
Wait, A must be in 4 or 5, so RETIA would have A in 4, which is allowed.

But let's check RETRO:
- R E T R O → R is in position 1 (allowed), E in 2 (correct), T in 3 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), O in 5 (new). This seems valid.

But we need to check if RETRO is a valid word. Yes, it is.

Option 2:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Positions 4 and 5: need R and another letter

Word: A E T _ _

We need R in 4 or 5. Let's try A E T R _ → A E T R O (AETRO - not a word)
Or A E T _ R → A E T I R (AETIR - not a word)

Option 3:
- Position 1: _
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: _
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: A

But A must be in 4 or 5, and R must be in 1,4,5. So:
- Position 1: T (since T must be in 3,4,5 but 3 is open)
- Word: T E _ R A

Check:
- T in position 1 is invalid (T was in position 1 in TEARS and marked -, so T cannot be in 1)
So T cannot be in 1.

Option 4:
- Position 1: T is invalid (already seen)
So let's try:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: _
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: R

Word: A E _ T R

Need a letter for position 3. Common letters not used: D, L, I, O, M, etc.

Possible: A E D T R (AEDTR - not a word)
A E L T R (AELTR - not a word)
A E I T R (AEITR - not a word)
A E M T R (AEMTR - not a word)

Option 5:
- Position 1: _
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: R

Word: _ E T A R

Possible first letters: R, A, L, D, I, O, M, etc.

R E T A R (RE TAR - not a word)
A E T A R (A E T A R - not a word)
L E T A R (LETAR - not a word)
D E T A R (DETAR - not a word)
I E T A R (IE T A R - not a word)
O E T A R (OE T A R - not a word)
M E T A R (METAR - this is a valid word, a type of aviation weather report)

METAR:
- M (new letter)
- E in position 2 (correct)
- T in position 3 (allowed)
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
This seems valid.

Let's check if there are better options. RETRO and METAR are both valid.

Between RETRO and METAR:
- RETRO: R E T R O
- METAR: M E T A R

Both use all required letters in correct positions. RETRO is more common, but METAR is also valid. Let's choose METAR as it uses M (new) and A in 4, R in 5.

But wait, A must be in 1,4,5. In METAR, A is in 4 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed). T is in 3 (allowed). E in 2 (correct). M is new.

This seems correct.

Final choice: METAR

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2
2. Contains R and A in positions 1, 4, or 5 (not overlapping)
3. Contains T in positions 3, 4, or 5
4. Does not contain C, N, or S

Let's try to place R and A first.

Option 1:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Positions 4 and 5: need to be filled with letters not yet used (not C, N, S)

Word: R E T _ _

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. Common letters left: D, L, I, O, M, etc.

Possible words:
- RETID (but I and D are ok)
- RETIA (but A is already used)
- RETRO (but O is ok)
- RETIA is invalid (A is in position 4, but A can be in 4)
Wait, A must be in 4 or 5, so RETIA would have A in 4, which is allowed.

But let's check RETRO:
- R E T R O → R is in position 1 (allowed), E in 2 (correct), T in 3 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), O in 5 (new). This seems valid.

But we need to check if RETRO is a valid word. Yes, it is.

Option 2:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Positions 4 and 5: need R and another letter

Word: A E T _ _

We need R in 4 or 5. Let's try A E T R _ → A E T R O (AETRO - not a word)
Or A E T _ R → A E T I R (AETIR - not a word)

Option 3:
- Position 1: _
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: _
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: A

But A must be in 4 or 5, and R must be in 1,4,5. So:
- Position 1: T (since T must be in 3,4,5 but 3 is open)
- Word: T E _ R A

Check:
- T in position 1 is invalid (T was in position 1 in TEARS and marked -, so T cannot be in 1)
So T cannot be in 1.

Option 4:
- Position 1: T is invalid (already seen)
So let's try:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: _
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: R

Word: A E _ T R

Need a letter for position 3. Common letters not used: D, L, I, O, M, etc.

Possible: A E D T R (AEDTR - not a word)
A E L T R (AELTR - not a word)
A E I T R (AEITR - not a word)
A E M T R (AEMTR - not a word)

Option 5:
- Position 1: _
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: R

Word: _ E T A R

Possible first letters: R, A, L, D, I, O, M, etc.

R E T A R (RE TAR - not a word)
A E T A R (A E T A R - not a word)
L E T A R (LETAR - not a word)
D E T A R (DETAR - not a word)
I E T A R (IE T A R - not a word)
O E T A R (OE T A R - not a word)
M E T A R (METAR - this is a valid word, a type of aviation weather report)

METAR:
- M (new letter)
- E in position 2 (correct)
- T in position 3 (allowed)
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
This seems valid.

Let's check if there are better options. RETRO and METAR are both valid.

Between RETRO and METAR:
- RETRO: R E T R O
- METAR: M E T A R

Both use all required letters in correct positions. RETRO is more common, but METAR is also valid. Let's choose METAR as it uses M (new) and A in 4, R in 5.

But wait, A must be in 1,4,5. In METAR, A is in 4 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed). T is in 3 (allowed). E in 2 (correct). M is new.

This seems correct.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it uses 5 of the most common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and covers both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N). This gives us a good baseline to work from.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- The word contains R, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively)
- The word does NOT contain C or N
- Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses R, A, E in different positions
- Does not use C or N
- Uses only the remaining 22 letters (excluding C, N)

A good strategy is to place R, A, E in new positions and fill the other two slots with common letters not yet eliminated (like S, T, L, O, I, etc.).

Let’s try: STARE
- S is a new letter we haven’t tested yet
- T is a new letter we haven’t tested yet
- A is in position 2 (new position)
- R is in position 3 (new position)
- E is in position 5 (but E was NOT in position 5 in CRANE, so this is invalid)

We cannot have E in position 5. Let’s try: STARE → E in 5 is invalid.

Next option: TEARS
- T is new
- E is in position 1 (new position)
- A is in position 2 (new position)
- R is in position 3 (new position)
- S is new
This uses all three known letters (R, A, E) in new positions and introduces two new letters (T, S).

Let’s check:
- R is in position 3 (was in 2 in CRANE → valid)
- A is in position 2 (was in 3 in CRANE → valid)
- E is in position 1 (was in 5 in CRANE → valid)
- T and S are new letters

This seems like a good second guess.

Let's summarize what we know so far.

Letters we know are in the word:
- E is in position 2 (✓ from TEARS)
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3
- T is in the word but NOT in position 1
- S is NOT in the word (x from TEARS)
- C and N are NOT in the word (from CRANE)

So far we have:
- _ E _ _ _
- R must be in 1, 4, or 5
- A must be in 1, 4, or 5 (and different from R)
- T must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 2 is E), so 3, 4, or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2
2. Contains R and A in positions 1, 4, or 5 (not overlapping)
3. Contains T in positions 3, 4, or 5
4. Does not contain C, N, or S

Let's try to place R and A first.

Option 1:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Positions 4 and 5: need to be filled with letters not yet used (not C, N, S)

Word: R E T _ _

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. Common letters left: D, L, I, O, M, etc.

Possible words:
- RETID (but I and D are ok)
- RETIA (but A is already used)
- RETRO (but O is ok)
- RETIA is invalid (A is in position 4, but A can be in 4)
Wait, A must be in 4 or 5, so RETIA would have A in 4, which is allowed.

But let's check RETRO:
- R E T R O → R is in position 1 (allowed), E in 2 (correct), T in 3 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), O in 5 (new). This seems valid.

But we need to check if RETRO is a valid word. Yes, it is.

Option 2:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Positions 4 and 5: need R and another letter

Word: A E T _ _

We need R in 4 or 5. Let's try A E T R _ → A E T R O (AETRO - not a word)
Or A E T _ R → A E T I R (AETIR - not a word)

Option 3:
- Position 1: _
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: _
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: A

But A must be in 4 or 5, and R must be in 1,4,5. So:
- Position 1: T (since T must be in 3,4,5 but 3 is open)
- Word: T E _ R A

Check:
- T in position 1 is invalid (T was in position 1 in TEARS and marked -, so T cannot be in 1)
So T cannot be in 1.

Option 4:
- Position 1: T is invalid (already seen)
So let's try:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: _
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: R

Word: A E _ T R

Need a letter for position 3. Common letters not used: D, L, I, O, M, etc.

Possible: A E D T R (AEDTR - not a word)
A E L T R (AELTR - not a word)
A E I T R (AEITR - not a word)
A E M T R (AEMTR - not a word)

Option 5:
- Position 1: _
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: R

Word: _ E T A R

Possible first letters: R, A, L, D, I, O, M, etc.

R E T A R (RE TAR - not a word)
A E T A R (A E T A R - not a word)
L E T A R (LETAR - not a word)
D E T A R (DETAR - not a word)
I E T A R (IE T A R - not a word)
O E T A R (OE T A R - not a word)
M E T A R (METAR - this is a valid word, a type of aviation weather report)

METAR:
- M (new letter)
- E in position 2 (correct)
- T in position 3 (allowed)
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
This seems valid.

Let's check if there are better options. RETRO and METAR are both valid.

Between RETRO and METAR:
- RETRO: R E T R O
- METAR: M E T A R

Both use all required letters in correct positions. RETRO is more common, but METAR is also valid. Let's choose METAR as it uses M (new) and A in 4, R in 5.

But wait, A must be in 1,4,5. In METAR, A is in 4 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed). T is in 3 (allowed). E in 2 (correct). M is new.

This seems correct.

Let's update what we now know after METAR.

Letters we know are in the word:
- E is in position 2 (✓ from TEARS and METAR)
- T is in position 3 (✓ from METAR)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 4 (- from METAR)
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 (- from CRANE, TEARS, METAR)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- C, N, S, M

So the word looks like: _ E T _ _
with A and R somewhere in the remaining positions (1, 4, or 5), but:
- A cannot be in 4
- R cannot be in 2, 3, 5 → so R must be in 1 or 4
- A cannot be in 3 (already known), and cannot be in 4, so A must be in 1 or 5

Possible patterns:
1. A E T _ _  (A in 1)
2. _ E T _ A  (A in 5)

But R must also fit into the remaining positions. Let's explore both patterns.

Pattern 1: A E T _ _
Available positions for R: 4 or 5 (but 5 is open)
- A E T R _  (R in 4)
- A E T _ R  (R in 5)

Pattern 2: _ E T _ A
Available positions for R: 1 or 4
- R E T _ A  (R in 1)
- _ E T R A  (R in 4)

We need to check which of these form valid 5-letter words with the remaining letters.

Pattern 1:
- A E T R _  → A E T R O (AETRO - not a word)
- A E T _ R  → A E T I R (AETIR - not a word)

Pattern 2:
- R E T _ A  → R E T I A (RE TIA - not a word)
- _ E T R A  → D E T R A (DET RA - not a word)
- L E T R A (LETRA - not a word)
- P E T R A (PETRA - this is a valid word, meaning rock or a city in Jordan)

PETRA:
- P (new letter)
- E in 2 (correct)
- T in 3 (correct)
- R in 4 (allowed, since R cannot be in 2,3,5)
- A in 5 (allowed, since A cannot be in 4)

This fits all constraints.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it uses 5 of the most common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and covers both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N). This gives us a good baseline to work from.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- The word contains R, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively)
- The word does NOT contain C or N
- Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses R, A, E in different positions
- Does not use C or N
- Uses only the remaining 22 letters (excluding C, N)

A good strategy is to place R, A, E in new positions and fill the other two slots with common letters not yet eliminated (like S, T, L, O, I, etc.).

Let’s try: STARE
- S is a new letter we haven’t tested yet
- T is a new letter we haven’t tested yet
- A is in position 2 (new position)
- R is in position 3 (new position)
- E is in position 5 (but E was NOT in position 5 in CRANE, so this is invalid)

We cannot have E in position 5. Let’s try: STARE → E in 5 is invalid.

Next option: TEARS
- T is new
- E is in position 1 (new position)
- A is in position 2 (new position)
- R is in position 3 (new position)
- S is new
This uses all three known letters (R, A, E) in new positions and introduces two new letters (T, S).

Let’s check:
- R is in position 3 (was in 2 in CRANE → valid)
- A is in position 2 (was in 3 in CRANE → valid)
- E is in position 1 (was in 5 in CRANE → valid)
- T and S are new letters

This seems like a good second guess.

Guess 2: TEARS -> FEEDBACK: T(-) E(✓) A(-) R(-) S(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's summarize what we know so far.

Letters we know are in the word:
- E is in position 2 (✓ from TEARS)
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3
- T is in the word but NOT in position 1
- S is NOT in the word (x from TEARS)
- C and N are NOT in the word (from CRANE)

So far we have:
- _ E _ _ _
- R must be in 1, 4, or 5
- A must be in 1, 4, or 5 (and different from R)
- T must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 2 is E), so 3, 4, or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2
2. Contains R and A in positions 1, 4, or 5 (not overlapping)
3. Contains T in positions 3, 4, or 5
4. Does not contain C, N, or S

Let's try to place R and A first.

Option 1:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Positions 4 and 5: need to be filled with letters not yet used (not C, N, S)

Word: R E T _ _

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. Common letters left: D, L, I, O, M, etc.

Possible words:
- RETID (but I and D are ok)
- RETIA (but A is already used)
- RETRO (but O is ok)
- RETIA is invalid (A is in position 4, but A can be in 4)
Wait, A must be in 4 or 5, so RETIA would have A in 4, which is allowed.

But let's check RETRO:
- R E T R O → R is in position 1 (allowed), E in 2 (correct), T in 3 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), O in 5 (new). This seems valid.

But we need to check if RETRO is a valid word. Yes, it is.

Option 2:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Positions 4 and 5: need R and another letter

Word: A E T _ _

We need R in 4 or 5. Let's try A E T R _ → A E T R O (AETRO - not a word)
Or A E T _ R → A E T I R (AETIR - not a word)

Option 3:
- Position 1: _
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: _
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: A

But A must be in 4 or 5, and R must be in 1,4,5. So:
- Position 1: T (since T must be in 3,4,5 but 3 is open)
- Word: T E _ R A

Check:
- T in position 1 is invalid (T was in position 1 in TEARS and marked -, so T cannot be in 1)
So T cannot be in 1.

Option 4:
- Position 1: T is invalid (already seen)
So let's try:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: _
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: R

Word: A E _ T R

Need a letter for position 3. Common letters not used: D, L, I, O, M, etc.

Possible: A E D T R (AEDTR - not a word)
A E L T R (AELTR - not a word)
A E I T R (AEITR - not a word)
A E M T R (AEMTR - not a word)

Option 5:
- Position 1: _
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: R

Word: _ E T A R

Possible first letters: R, A, L, D, I, O, M, etc.

R E T A R (RE TAR - not a word)
A E T A R (A E T A R - not a word)
L E T A R (LETAR - not a word)
D E T A R (DETAR - not a word)
I E T A R (IE T A R - not a word)
O E T A R (OE T A R - not a word)
M E T A R (METAR - this is a valid word, a type of aviation weather report)

METAR:
- M (new letter)
- E in position 2 (correct)
- T in position 3 (allowed)
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
This seems valid.

Let's check if there are better options. RETRO and METAR are both valid.

Between RETRO and METAR:
- RETRO: R E T R O
- METAR: M E T A R

Both use all required letters in correct positions. RETRO is more common, but METAR is also valid. Let's choose METAR as it uses M (new) and A in 4, R in 5.

But wait, A must be in 1,4,5. In METAR, A is in 4 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed). T is in 3 (allowed). E in 2 (correct). M is new.

This seems correct.

Final choice: METAR

Guess 3: METAR -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) T(✓) A(-) R(-)
<|im_end|>

Let's update what we now know after METAR.

Letters we know are in the word:
- E is in position 2 (✓ from TEARS and METAR)
- T is in position 3 (✓ from METAR)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 4 (- from METAR)
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 (- from CRANE, TEARS, METAR)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- C, N, S, M

So the word looks like: _ E T _ _
with A and R somewhere in the remaining positions (1, 4, or 5), but:
- A cannot be in 4
- R cannot be in 2, 3, 5 → so R must be in 1 or 4
- A cannot be in 3 (already known), and cannot be in 4, so A must be in 1 or 5

Possible patterns:
1. A E T _ _  (A in 1)
2. _ E T _ A  (A in 5)

But R must also fit into the remaining positions. Let's explore both patterns.

Pattern 1: A E T _ _
Available positions for R: 4 or 5 (but 5 is open)
- A E T R _  (R in 4)
- A E T _ R  (R in 5)

Pattern 2: _ E T _ A
Available positions for R: 1 or 4
- R E T _ A  (R in 1)
- _ E T R A  (R in 4)

We need to check which of these form valid 5-letter words with the remaining letters.

Pattern 1:
- A E T R _  → A E T R O (AETRO - not a word)
- A E T _ R  → A E T I R (AETIR - not a word)

Pattern 2:
- R E T _ A  → R E T I A (RE TIA - not a word)
- _ E T R A  → D E T R A (DET RA - not a word)
- L E T R A (LETRA - not a word)
- P E T R A (PETRA - this is a valid word, meaning rock or a city in Jordan)

PETRA:
- P (new letter)
- E in 2 (correct)
- T in 3 (correct)
- R in 4 (allowed, since R cannot be in 2,3,5)
- A in 5 (allowed, since A cannot be in 4)

This fits all constraints.Based on the updated constraints, the only valid word that fits is PETRA.

From the latest feedback on PETRA:

- P is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in position 2 (✓) – confirmed
- T is in position 3 (✓) – confirmed
- R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-) – so R must be in position 1 or 5 (since it can’t be in 2,3,4 from earlier clues)
- A is in position 5 (✓) – confirmed

So the word structure is:  
[1] [E] [T] [4] [A]  
with R needing to be in position 1 or 5.  
But position 5 is already A, so R must be in position 1.

Therefore the word must start with R:  
R E T _ A

The missing letter in position 4 must be a consonant not yet ruled out.  
Letters already eliminated: C, N, S, M, P.  
Common remaining consonants: D, L, I, O, B, G, etc.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it uses 5 of the most common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and covers both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N). This gives us a good baseline to work from.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- The word contains R, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively)
- The word does NOT contain C or N
- Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses R, A, E in different positions
- Does not use C or N
- Uses only the remaining 22 letters (excluding C, N)

A good strategy is to place R, A, E in new positions and fill the other two slots with common letters not yet eliminated (like S, T, L, O, I, etc.).

Let’s try: STARE
- S is a new letter we haven’t tested yet
- T is a new letter we haven’t tested yet
- A is in position 2 (new position)
- R is in position 3 (new position)
- E is in position 5 (but E was NOT in position 5 in CRANE, so this is invalid)

We cannot have E in position 5. Let’s try: STARE → E in 5 is invalid.

Next option: TEARS
- T is new
- E is in position 1 (new position)
- A is in position 2 (new position)
- R is in position 3 (new position)
- S is new
This uses all three known letters (R, A, E) in new positions and introduces two new letters (T, S).

Let’s check:
- R is in position 3 (was in 2 in CRANE → valid)
- A is in position 2 (was in 3 in CRANE → valid)
- E is in position 1 (was in 5 in CRANE → valid)
- T and S are new letters

This seems like a good second guess.

Guess 2: TEARS -> FEEDBACK: T(-) E(✓) A(-) R(-) S(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's summarize what we know so far.

Letters we know are in the word:
- E is in position 2 (✓ from TEARS)
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3
- T is in the word but NOT in position 1
- S is NOT in the word (x from TEARS)
- C and N are NOT in the word (from CRANE)

So far we have:
- _ E _ _ _
- R must be in 1, 4, or 5
- A must be in 1, 4, or 5 (and different from R)
- T must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 2 is E), so 3, 4, or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2
2. Contains R and A in positions 1, 4, or 5 (not overlapping)
3. Contains T in positions 3, 4, or 5
4. Does not contain C, N, or S

Let's try to place R and A first.

Option 1:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Positions 4 and 5: need to be filled with letters not yet used (not C, N, S)

Word: R E T _ _

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. Common letters left: D, L, I, O, M, etc.

Possible words:
- RETID (but I and D are ok)
- RETIA (but A is already used)
- RETRO (but O is ok)
- RETIA is invalid (A is in position 4, but A can be in 4)
Wait, A must be in 4 or 5, so RETIA would have A in 4, which is allowed.

But let's check RETRO:
- R E T R O → R is in position 1 (allowed), E in 2 (correct), T in 3 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), O in 5 (new). This seems valid.

But we need to check if RETRO is a valid word. Yes, it is.

Option 2:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Positions 4 and 5: need R and another letter

Word: A E T _ _

We need R in 4 or 5. Let's try A E T R _ → A E T R O (AETRO - not a word)
Or A E T _ R → A E T I R (AETIR - not a word)

Option 3:
- Position 1: _
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: _
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: A

But A must be in 4 or 5, and R must be in 1,4,5. So:
- Position 1: T (since T must be in 3,4,5 but 3 is open)
- Word: T E _ R A

Check:
- T in position 1 is invalid (T was in position 1 in TEARS and marked -, so T cannot be in 1)
So T cannot be in 1.

Option 4:
- Position 1: T is invalid (already seen)
So let's try:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: _
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: R

Word: A E _ T R

Need a letter for position 3. Common letters not used: D, L, I, O, M, etc.

Possible: A E D T R (AEDTR - not a word)
A E L T R (AELTR - not a word)
A E I T R (AEITR - not a word)
A E M T R (AEMTR - not a word)

Option 5:
- Position 1: _
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: R

Word: _ E T A R

Possible first letters: R, A, L, D, I, O, M, etc.

R E T A R (RE TAR - not a word)
A E T A R (A E T A R - not a word)
L E T A R (LETAR - not a word)
D E T A R (DETAR - not a word)
I E T A R (IE T A R - not a word)
O E T A R (OE T A R - not a word)
M E T A R (METAR - this is a valid word, a type of aviation weather report)

METAR:
- M (new letter)
- E in position 2 (correct)
- T in position 3 (allowed)
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
This seems valid.

Let's check if there are better options. RETRO and METAR are both valid.

Between RETRO and METAR:
- RETRO: R E T R O
- METAR: M E T A R

Both use all required letters in correct positions. RETRO is more common, but METAR is also valid. Let's choose METAR as it uses M (new) and A in 4, R in 5.

But wait, A must be in 1,4,5. In METAR, A is in 4 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed). T is in 3 (allowed). E in 2 (correct). M is new.

This seems correct.

Final choice: METAR

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)

Guess 3: METAR -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(✓) T(✓) A(-) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's update what we now know after METAR.

Letters we know are in the word:
- E is in position 2 (✓ from TEARS and METAR)
- T is in position 3 (✓ from METAR)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 4 (- from METAR)
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 (- from CRANE, TEARS, METAR)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- C, N, S, M

So the word looks like: _ E T _ _
with A and R somewhere in the remaining positions (1, 4, or 5), but:
- A cannot be in 4
- R cannot be in 2, 3, 5 → so R must be in 1 or 4
- A cannot be in 3 (already known), and cannot be in 4, so A must be in 1 or 5

Possible patterns:
1. A E T _ _  (A in 1)
2. _ E T _ A  (A in 5)

But R must also fit into the remaining positions. Let's explore both patterns.

Pattern 1: A E T _ _
Available positions for R: 4 or 5 (but 5 is open)
- A E T R _  (R in 4)
- A E T _ R  (R in 5)

Pattern 2: _ E T _ A
Available positions for R: 1 or 4
- R E T _ A  (R in 1)
- _ E T R A  (R in 4)

We need to check which of these form valid 5-letter words with the remaining letters.

Pattern 1:
- A E T R _  → A E T R O (AETRO - not a word)
- A E T _ R  → A E T I R (AETIR - not a word)

Pattern 2:
- R E T _ A  → R E T I A (RE TIA - not a word)
- _ E T R A  → D E T R A (DET RA - not a word)
- L E T R A (LETRA - not a word)
- P E T R A (PETRA - this is a valid word, meaning rock or a city in Jordan)

PETRA:
- P (new letter)
- E in 2 (correct)
- T in 3 (correct)
- R in 4 (allowed, since R cannot be in 2,3,5)
- A in 5 (allowed, since A cannot be in 4)

This fits all constraints.Based on the updated constraints, the only valid word that fits is PETRA.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters known to be in the word and their correct positions:
  – E is in position 2
  – T is in position 3
  – A is in position 5

- Letters known to be in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
  – R (from CRANE: R is in the word but not in position 2; from METAR: R is not in position 4; from PETRA: R is not in position 4 again. So R must be in position 1.)

- Letters known NOT to be in the word:
  – C, N, S, M, P

Current pattern: R E T _ A (positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are fixed; position 4 is unknown)

Letters still allowed for position 4 (must not be any of C, N, S, M, P and must form a valid 5-letter word):
Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Wait, let’s double-check:
The only common word that fits R E T _ A is RETIA (variant spelling of retina), but it’s obscure.
Another possibility is RETBA (retbate), but that’s also rare.
Actually, the more common word is RETIA, but it’s not in standard dictionaries.
However, there’s also the word RETIA in some Scrabble lists.

But let me think differently – maybe position 4 is another vowel.
Looking at common 5-letter words ending in A with E T in the middle:
RETIA seems to be the only common one.

But let me check another angle: the word must be RET_ A with R in 1, E in 2, T in 3, A in 5.
The only valid word I can find is RETIA (retina).

However, in standard Wordle lists, RETIA is not listed as a valid word.
Let me think of other possibilities:
- RETBA – no
- RETFA – no
- RETGA – no
- RETIA – yes, but rare
- RETKA – no
- RETLA – no
- RETMA – no (M is excluded)
- RETNA – no (N is excluded)
- RETPA – no (P is excluded)
- RETQA – no
- RETRA – no (R is already in 1)
- RETSA – no (S is excluded)
- RETTA – no (T is already in 3)
- RETUA – no
- RETVA – no
- RETWA – no
- RETXA – no
- RETYA – no
- RETZA – no

It appears the only possible word is RETIA, but since it’s not in standard lists, I must have missed something.
Wait, let me check again: the word must be RET_ A with R in 1, E in 2, T in 3, A in 5.
Looking at a comprehensive list of 5-letter words, the only one that fits is RETIA (retina), but it’s not in Wordle’s list.
Hmm, this suggests I might have an error in deducing R must be in position 1.

Re-examining R placement:
From CRANE: R is in the word but not in position 2.
From METAR: R is not in position 4.
From PETRA: R is not in position 4 again.
So R can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
But positions 3 is T (from METAR), and position 5 is A (from PETRA), so R must be in position 1.

Thus, the word must be R E T _ A.
The only valid word in standard lists is RETIA, but it’s not recognized.
Let me check again: is there any other word?
Actually, the word is RETIA (variant spelling), but Wordle accepts RETIA.
However, more commonly, the word is RETINA (6 letters), so this seems off.
Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:

Guess 4: PETRA -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) T(✓) R(-) A(✓)
This means:
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- T is in position 3 (✓)
- A is in position 5 (✓)
- R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
- P is NOT in the word (x)

So the pattern is R E T _ A (R must be in position 1 to satisfy all constraints), and the missing letter is in position 4.

Looking at standard 5-letter words:
RETIA is the only one that fits, but it’s not in Wordle’s list.
Let me check another possibility: maybe the word is RETIA (accepted in some dictionaries), or RETBA (retbate), but those are obscure.

However, upon closer inspection, the word must be RETIA, as all other letters are excluded.
Given this, the correct next guess is RETIA.

But since RETIA is not in Wordle’s list, I must have made an error.
Rechecking:
- R must be in position 1 (only remaining spot)
- E in 2, T in 3, A in 5
- Position 4 must be a letter not yet excluded (not C, N, S, M, P)
Looking at valid words: the only one is RETIA.

Given this, I will proceed with RETIA as the next guess.

Based on the updated constraints:
- Positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are fixed as R, E, T, A respectively.
