### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

""SLATE"" is particularly effective because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so not first)
- L, A, T are not in the word at all
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so not last)

We now know:
- The word contains S and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- The word does not contain L, A, or T.

To maximize information, we want a word that:
1. Uses S and E in different positions (to test where they belong)
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been ruled out
3. Avoids L, A, T

Good candidate letters left: R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.

A strong second guess would be ""SHORE"" because:
- It places S in position 2 and E in position 5 (but we know E is not in position 5 from SLATE feedback, so this is bad - we need to avoid E in position 5)
Let me rethink.

Better choices:
- ""ROSES"" - but E is in position 4 (good), S is in position 5 (good), and introduces R, O
- ""SERFS"" - but S is in position 5 (good), E is in position 1 (good), introduces R, F

- S cannot be in position 1 or 3, but positions 2 and 4 are already taken by O and E, so the only remaining place for S is position 5, which is already correct (from ROSES feedback).

Therefore, the word must be R O _ E S, and we just need to find the missing third letter.

   - R, O, E, S are confirmed in positions 1, 2, 4, 5
   - B is not in the word

So the pattern is: R O _ E S

We need a single letter for position 3 that:
- Has not been ruled out (so not L, A, T, B)
- Forms a valid 5-letter English word

Common letters left: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y

Looking for common words starting with RO and ending with E S:
- ROMES (R-O-M-E-S)
- ROPES (R-O-P-E-S)
- RUSES (R-U-S-E-S) – but S is already in position 5, so this would have S in position 3 which is ruled out
- ROUTS (doesn't end with E S)
- ROWER (doesn't end with E S)

Between ROMES and ROPES, both are valid. ROMES is more common in word games, so I'll try ROMES.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

""SLATE"" is particularly effective because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so not first)
- L, A, T are not in the word at all
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so not last)

We now know:
- The word contains S and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- The word does not contain L, A, or T.

To maximize information, we want a word that:
1. Uses S and E in different positions (to test where they belong)
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been ruled out
3. Avoids L, A, T

Good candidate letters left: R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.

A strong second guess would be ""SHORE"" because:
- It places S in position 2 and E in position 5 (but we know E is not in position 5 from SLATE feedback, so this is bad - we need to avoid E in position 5)
Let me rethink.

Better choices:
- ""ROSES"" - but E is in position 4 (good), S is in position 5 (good), and introduces R, O
- ""SERFS"" - but S is in position 5 (good), E is in position 1 (good), introduces R, F
- ""CRISP"" - but no E, so bad
- ""SHIRE"" - but E is in position 5 (bad)

Best seems ""ROSES"":
- R, O, S, E, S
- S in position 3 (new position)
- E in position 4 (new position)
- Introduces R and O

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1
   - E is in the word but not in position 5
   - L, A, T are not in the word

2. ROSES → R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)
   - R is in the correct position (position 1)
   - O is in the correct position (position 2)
   - S is in the word but not in position 3
   - E is in the correct position (position 4)
   - The last S is in the correct position (position 5)

So far we know:
- The word starts with R O _ E S (positions 1-5)
- Letters already confirmed: R, O, E, S
- Letters ruled out: L, A, T
- S cannot be in position 1 or 3, but positions 2 and 4 are already taken by O and E, so the only remaining place for S is position 5, which is already correct (from ROSES feedback).

Therefore, the word must be R O _ E S, and we just need to find the missing third letter.

Letters not yet used and not ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common letter that fits. Let's think of common 5-letter words that start with RO and end with E S:
- ROBES
- ROMES
- RONES (not a word)
- ROPES
- ROSES (already tried)
- ROUTS (doesn't end with E S)
- ROWER (doesn't end with E S)

The most common one seems ROBES (short for robes, but also a valid word meaning to dress in robes). Let's try ROBES.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

""SLATE"" is particularly effective because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so not first)
- L, A, T are not in the word at all
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so not last)

We now know:
- The word contains S and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- The word does not contain L, A, or T.

To maximize information, we want a word that:
1. Uses S and E in different positions (to test where they belong)
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been ruled out
3. Avoids L, A, T

Good candidate letters left: R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.

A strong second guess would be ""SHORE"" because:
- It places S in position 2 and E in position 5 (but we know E is not in position 5 from SLATE feedback, so this is bad - we need to avoid E in position 5)
Let me rethink.

Better choices:
- ""ROSES"" - but E is in position 4 (good), S is in position 5 (good), and introduces R, O
- ""SERFS"" - but S is in position 5 (good), E is in position 1 (good), introduces R, F
- ""CRISP"" - but no E, so bad
- ""SHIRE"" - but E is in position 5 (bad)

Best seems ""ROSES"":
- R, O, S, E, S
- S in position 3 (new position)
- E in position 4 (new position)
- Introduces R and O

Guess 2: ROSES -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1
   - E is in the word but not in position 5
   - L, A, T are not in the word

2. ROSES → R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)
   - R is in the correct position (position 1)
   - O is in the correct position (position 2)
   - S is in the word but not in position 3
   - E is in the correct position (position 4)
   - The last S is in the correct position (position 5)

So far we know:
- The word starts with R O _ E S (positions 1-5)
- Letters already confirmed: R, O, E, S
- Letters ruled out: L, A, T
- S cannot be in position 1 or 3, but positions 2 and 4 are already taken by O and E, so the only remaining place for S is position 5, which is already correct (from ROSES feedback).

Therefore, the word must be R O _ E S, and we just need to find the missing third letter.

Letters not yet used and not ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common letter that fits. Let's think of common 5-letter words that start with RO and end with E S:
- ROBES
- ROMES
- RONES (not a word)
- ROPES
- ROSES (already tried)
- ROUTS (doesn't end with E S)
- ROWER (doesn't end with E S)

The most common one seems ROBES (short for robes, but also a valid word meaning to dress in robes). Let's try ROBES.

From the three pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - S is in the word but not position 1
   - E is in the word but not position 5
   - L, A, T are not in the word

2. ROSES → R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)
   - R is correct in position 1
   - O is correct in position 2
   - S is in the word but not position 3
   - E is correct in position 4
   - S is correct in position 5

3. ROBES → R(✓) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) S(✓)
   - R, O, E, S are confirmed in positions 1, 2, 4, 5
   - B is not in the word

So the pattern is: R O _ E S

We need a single letter for position 3 that:
- Has not been ruled out (so not L, A, T, B)
- Forms a valid 5-letter English word

Common letters left: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y

Looking for common words starting with RO and ending with E S:
- ROMES (R-O-M-E-S)
- ROPES (R-O-P-E-S)
- RUSES (R-U-S-E-S) – but S is already in position 5, so this would have S in position 3 which is ruled out
- ROUTS (doesn't end with E S)
- ROWER (doesn't end with E S)

Between ROMES and ROPES, both are valid. ROMES is more common in word games, so I'll try ROMES.
