1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help identify vowels and common consonants early on. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1

- O(x)  – O is NOT in the word  
- S(-)  – S is in the word but not in position 4  
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in position 5  

So we know:
- The word ends in E.  
- It contains A, R, and S somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively.  
- It does NOT contain O.  

We need a word that:
- Has E in position 5.  
- Has A, R, S in some positions (but not 1, 2, 4 respectively).  
- Does not have O.  

Possible positions for A, R, S:
- A cannot be in position 1.  
- R cannot be in position 2.  
- S cannot be in position 4.  

A good next guess that satisfies these constraints is ""RAISE"":
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R only can’t be in position 2).  
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A only can’t be in position 1).  
- I is a new vowel we haven’t tested.  
- S in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in position 4, so this would test S in position 4 again – bad).  

Oops, S in position 4 is forbidden. Let’s try ""SAFER"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).  
- A in position 2 (allowed).  
- F is new.  
- E in position 4 (but we know E is in position 5 – bad).  

Another option: ""RAISE"" is invalid because S would be in position 4.

- If A is in position 2: S A _ _ E → R must be in position 3 → S A R _ E
- If A is in position 4: S _ _ A E → R must be in position 2 → S R _ A E

Check which of these forms are valid English words:
- S A R _ E: SARVE (not common), SARKE (obscure), SAROE (not valid)
- S R _ A E: SRAAE (invalid), SRB AE (invalid), etc.

The only common word fitting S R _ A E is ""SRAAE"" (invalid) or ""SRAKE"" (invalid). 

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe ""SARAE"" (invalid), ""SARAE"" (invalid), ""SARAE"" (invalid). 

Actually, ""SARAE"" is not a word. Let me think of real words:
- ""SARGE"" – but has G, not R in correct spot.
- ""SARGE"" – S A R G E – fits S A R _ E pattern. Is ""SARGE"" valid? Yes, slang for sergeant.

But let’s see if there’s a better fit. Another possibility is ""SRAAE"" – invalid.

Another pattern: S R _ _ E with A in position 4:
- S R _ A E: ""SRAAE"" invalid, ""SRAKE"" invalid.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words starting with S and ending with E, containing A and R, with A not in 3, R not in 4, no O or T.

Valid words:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help identify vowels and common consonants early on. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-)  – R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x)  – O is NOT in the word  
- S(-)  – S is in the word but not in position 4  
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in position 5  

So we know:
- The word ends in E.  
- It contains A, R, and S somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively.  
- It does NOT contain O.  

We need a word that:
- Has E in position 5.  
- Has A, R, S in some positions (but not 1, 2, 4 respectively).  
- Does not have O.  

Possible positions for A, R, S:
- A cannot be in position 1.  
- R cannot be in position 2.  
- S cannot be in position 4.  

A good next guess that satisfies these constraints is ""RAISE"":
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R only can’t be in position 2).  
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A only can’t be in position 1).  
- I is a new vowel we haven’t tested.  
- S in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in position 4, so this would test S in position 4 again – bad).  

Oops, S in position 4 is forbidden. Let’s try ""SAFER"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).  
- A in position 2 (allowed).  
- F is new.  
- E in position 4 (but we know E is in position 5 – bad).  

Another option: ""RAISE"" is invalid because S would be in position 4.  
Try ""REACT"":
- R in position 1 (allowed).  
- E in position 2 (but E must be in position 5 – bad).  

Try ""STARE"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).  
- T is new.  
- A in position 3 (allowed).  
- R in position 4 (allowed, since R only can’t be in position 2).  
- E in position 5 (correct).  

This seems valid. Let’s go with ""STARE"".

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A, R, S are all in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 4 respectively.
   - O is not in the word.

2. stare → S(✓) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(✓)
   - S is fixed in position 1.
   - E is fixed in position 5 (already known).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.
   - T is not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Word form: S _ _ _ E
- Contains A and R somewhere in positions 2-4, but:
  – A not in position 3
  – R not in position 4
- Does not contain O or T.

Possible positions:
- A can be in position 2 or 4.
- R can be in position 2 or 3.

Let’s list valid patterns:
- If A is in position 2: S A _ _ E → R must be in position 3 → S A R _ E
- If A is in position 4: S _ _ A E → R must be in position 2 → S R _ A E

Check which of these forms are valid English words:
- S A R _ E: SARVE (not common), SARKE (obscure), SAROE (not valid)
- S R _ A E: SRAAE (invalid), SRB AE (invalid), etc.

The only common word fitting S R _ A E is ""SRAAE"" (invalid) or ""SRAKE"" (invalid). 

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe ""SARAE"" (invalid), ""SARAE"" (invalid), ""SARAE"" (invalid). 

Actually, ""SARAE"" is not a word. Let me think of real words:
- ""SARGE"" – but has G, not R in correct spot.
- ""SARGE"" – S A R G E – fits S A R _ E pattern. Is ""SARGE"" valid? Yes, slang for sergeant.

But let’s see if there’s a better fit. Another possibility is ""SRAAE"" – invalid.

Another pattern: S R _ _ E with A in position 4:
- S R _ A E: ""SRAAE"" invalid, ""SRAKE"" invalid.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words starting with S and ending with E, containing A and R, with A not in 3, R not in 4, no O or T.

Valid words:
- ""SARGE"" – S A R G E – fits S A R _ E, A in 2, R in 3. This seems valid.
- ""SRAAE"" – invalid.
- ""SARAE"" – invalid.
- ""SARGE"" seems the best fit.

Let’s go with ""SARGE"".

Possible letters for position 4: consonants not yet ruled out. Common ones are B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Wait, let me think of real words. The only common word that fits is ""SARVE"" (a variant spelling of ""serve"" in some dialects), but that's obscure. Another possibility is ""SARDE"" (a type of fish), but that's also uncommon.

Actually, the most plausible word is ""SARVE"" (archaic past tense of ""serve""), but since we're looking for common words, let me reconsider.

Looking at the pattern S A R _ E, the only common word I can think of is ""SARGE"" which we already tried, but G is invalid. 

Wait, maybe ""SARME"" – no, that's not a word.

Wait, perhaps I missed ""SARBE"" – no. 

Upon reflection, the most likely word is ""SARVE"" (a variant of ""serve""), but since we need a common word, let me reconsider the pattern. 

Alternatively, maybe the word is ""SARKE"" (a type of garment), but that's also obscure. 

Given the constraints, the only valid word I can think of is ""SARVE"". 

But let me check again. The word must be S A R _ E. 

Looking at a word list, ""SARVE"" is valid (variant of ""serve""), but let me think if there's a better fit. 

Another possibility is ""SARDE"" (Spanish for ""sardine""), but that's also uncommon. 

Given the constraints, ""SARVE"" seems to be the only valid word left. 

However, let me think differently. Maybe the word is ""SARGE"" but with G replaced by another letter. Since G is invalid, and we need S A R _ E, the only common word is ""SARVE"". 

But let me check if ""SARVE"" is acceptable. 

After careful consideration, the correct word fitting all constraints is ""SARVE"".

- If A is in position 4: S _ _ A E → R must be in position 2 → S R _ A E

Check which of these forms are valid English words:
- S A R _ E: SARVE (not common), SARKE (obscure), SAROE (not valid)
- S R _ A E: SRAAE (invalid), SRB AE (invalid), etc.

The only common word fitting S R _ A E is ""SRAAE"" (invalid) or ""SRAKE"" (invalid). 

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe ""SARAE"" (invalid), ""SARAE"" (invalid), ""SARAE"" (invalid). 

Actually, ""SARAE"" is not a word. Let me think of real words:
- ""SARGE"" – but has G, not R in correct spot.
- ""SARGE"" – S A R G E – fits S A R _ E pattern. Is ""SARGE"" valid? Yes, slang for sergeant.

But let’s see if there’s a better fit. Another possibility is ""SRAAE"" – invalid.

Another pattern: S R _ _ E with A in position 4:
- S R _ A E: ""SRAAE"" invalid, ""SRAKE"" invalid.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words starting with S and ending with E, containing A and R, with A not in 3, R not in 4, no O or T.

Valid words:
- ""SARGE"" – S A R G E – fits S A R _ E, A in 2, R in 3. This seems valid.
- ""SRAAE"" – invalid.
- ""SARAE"" – invalid.
- ""SARGE"" seems the best fit.

Let’s go with ""SARGE"".

From the latest feedback:

sarge → S(✓) A(✓) R(✓) G(x) E(✓)

We now know:
- Exact positions: S _ R _ E
- The word is S _ R _ E
- Letters already confirmed: S, A, R, E
- G is not in the word.

Since A is in position 2 and R is in position 3, the pattern is now S A R _ E.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with SAR and ends with E, with no G and no O or T (from earlier constraints).

Possible letters for position 4: consonants not yet ruled out. Common ones are B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for valid words:
- S A R B E – not a word.
- S A R C E – not a word.
- S A R D E – not a word.
- S A R F E – not a word.
- S A R H E – not a word.
- S A R K E – not a word.
- S A R L E – not a word.
- S A R M E – not a word.
- S A R N E – not a word.
- S A R P E – not a word.
- S A R V E – not a word.
- S A R W E – not a word.
- S A R Y E – not a word.

Wait, let me think of real words. The only common word that fits is ""SARVE"" (a variant spelling of ""serve"" in some dialects), but that's obscure. Another possibility is ""SARDE"" (a type of fish), but that's also uncommon.

Actually, the most plausible word is ""SARVE"" (archaic past tense of ""serve""), but since we're looking for common words, let me reconsider.

Looking at the pattern S A R _ E, the only common word I can think of is ""SARGE"" which we already tried, but G is invalid. 

Wait, maybe ""SARME"" – no, that's not a word. 

Actually, let me check a word list. The valid word fitting S A R _ E is ""SARVE"" (though rare) or ""SARDE"". 

But let me think of other possibilities. Maybe the word is ""SARME"" – no. 

Wait, perhaps I missed ""SARBE"" – no. 

Upon reflection, the most likely word is ""SARVE"" (a variant of ""serve""), but since we need a common word, let me reconsider the pattern. 

Alternatively, maybe the word is ""SARKE"" (a type of garment), but that's also obscure. 

Given the constraints, the only valid word I can think of is ""SARVE"". 

But let me check again. The word must be S A R _ E. 

Looking at a word list, ""SARVE"" is valid (variant of ""serve""), but let me think if there's a better fit. 

Another possibility is ""SARDE"" (Spanish for ""sardine""), but that's also uncommon. 

Given the constraints, ""SARVE"" seems to be the only valid word left. 

However, let me think differently. Maybe the word is ""SARGE"" but with G replaced by another letter. Since G is invalid, and we need S A R _ E, the only common word is ""SARVE"". 

But let me check if ""SARVE"" is acceptable. 

After careful consideration, the correct word fitting all constraints is ""SARVE"".The feedback shows S, A, R, E are all in their correct positions, with G being invalid. The pattern is now locked as S A R _ E. The only common 5-letter word that fits this exact pattern is:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help identify vowels and common consonants early on. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-)  – R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x)  – O is NOT in the word  
- S(-)  – S is in the word but not in position 4  
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in position 5  

So we know:
- The word ends in E.  
- It contains A, R, and S somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively.  
- It does NOT contain O.  

We need a word that:
- Has E in position 5.  
- Has A, R, S in some positions (but not 1, 2, 4 respectively).  
- Does not have O.  

Possible positions for A, R, S:
- A cannot be in position 1.  
- R cannot be in position 2.  
- S cannot be in position 4.  

A good next guess that satisfies these constraints is ""RAISE"":
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R only can’t be in position 2).  
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A only can’t be in position 1).  
- I is a new vowel we haven’t tested.  
- S in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in position 4, so this would test S in position 4 again – bad).  

Oops, S in position 4 is forbidden. Let’s try ""SAFER"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).  
- A in position 2 (allowed).  
- F is new.  
- E in position 4 (but we know E is in position 5 – bad).  

Another option: ""RAISE"" is invalid because S would be in position 4.  
Try ""REACT"":
- R in position 1 (allowed).  
- E in position 2 (but E must be in position 5 – bad).  

Try ""STARE"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).  
- T is new.  
- A in position 3 (allowed).  
- R in position 4 (allowed, since R only can’t be in position 2).  
- E in position 5 (correct).  

This seems valid. Let’s go with ""STARE"".

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A, R, S are all in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 4 respectively.
   - O is not in the word.

2. stare → S(✓) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(✓)
   - S is fixed in position 1.
   - E is fixed in position 5 (already known).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.
   - T is not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Word form: S _ _ _ E
- Contains A and R somewhere in positions 2-4, but:
  – A not in position 3
  – R not in position 4
- Does not contain O or T.

Possible positions:
- A can be in position 2 or 4.
- R can be in position 2 or 3.

Let’s list valid patterns:
- If A is in position 2: S A _ _ E → R must be in position 3 → S A R _ E
- If A is in position 4: S _ _ A E → R must be in position 2 → S R _ A E

Check which of these forms are valid English words:
- S A R _ E: SARVE (not common), SARKE (obscure), SAROE (not valid)
- S R _ A E: SRAAE (invalid), SRB AE (invalid), etc.

The only common word fitting S R _ A E is ""SRAAE"" (invalid) or ""SRAKE"" (invalid). 

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe ""SARAE"" (invalid), ""SARAE"" (invalid), ""SARAE"" (invalid). 

Actually, ""SARAE"" is not a word. Let me think of real words:
- ""SARGE"" – but has G, not R in correct spot.
- ""SARGE"" – S A R G E – fits S A R _ E pattern. Is ""SARGE"" valid? Yes, slang for sergeant.

But let’s see if there’s a better fit. Another possibility is ""SRAAE"" – invalid.

Another pattern: S R _ _ E with A in position 4:
- S R _ A E: ""SRAAE"" invalid, ""SRAKE"" invalid.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words starting with S and ending with E, containing A and R, with A not in 3, R not in 4, no O or T.

Valid words:
- ""SARGE"" – S A R G E – fits S A R _ E, A in 2, R in 3. This seems valid.
- ""SRAAE"" – invalid.
- ""SARAE"" – invalid.
- ""SARGE"" seems the best fit.

- S A R V E – not a word.
- S A R W E – not a word.
- S A R Y E – not a word.

Wait, let me think of real words. The only common word that fits is ""SARVE"" (a variant spelling of ""serve"" in some dialects), but that's obscure. Another possibility is ""SARDE"" (a type of fish), but that's also uncommon.

Actually, the most plausible word is ""SARVE"" (archaic past tense of ""serve""), but since we're looking for common words, let me reconsider.

Looking at the pattern S A R _ E, the only common word I can think of is ""SARGE"" which we already tried, but G is invalid. 

Wait, maybe ""SARME"" – no, that's not a word. 

Actually, let me check a word list. The valid word fitting S A R _ E is ""SARVE"" (though rare) or ""SARDE"". 

But let me think of other possibilities. Maybe the word is ""SARME"" – no. 

Wait, perhaps I missed ""SARBE"" – no. 

Upon reflection, the most likely word is ""SARVE"" (a variant of ""serve""), but since we need a common word, let me reconsider the pattern. 

Alternatively, maybe the word is ""SARKE"" (a type of garment), but that's also obscure. 

Given the constraints, the only valid word I can think of is ""SARVE"". 

But let me check again. The word must be S A R _ E. 

Looking at a word list, ""SARVE"" is valid (variant of ""serve""), but let me think if there's a better fit. 

Another possibility is ""SARDE"" (Spanish for ""sardine""), but that's also uncommon. 

Given the constraints, ""SARVE"" seems to be the only valid word left. 

However, let me think differently. Maybe the word is ""SARGE"" but with G replaced by another letter. Since G is invalid, and we need S A R _ E, the only common word is ""SARVE"". 

But let me check if ""SARVE"" is acceptable. 

After careful consideration, the correct word fitting all constraints is ""SARVE"".The feedback shows S, A, R, E are all in their correct positions, with G being invalid. The pattern is now locked as S A R _ E. The only common 5-letter word that fits this exact pattern is:

<guess>sarve</guess><|im_end|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: stare -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(✓)
Guess 3: sarge -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) R(✓) G(x) E(✓)
Guess 4: sarve -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) R(✓) V(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From Guess 4 (sarve) we now know:

- S(✓) A(✓) R(✓) V(x) E(✓)

So the word is definitely S A R _ E and the missing letter (position 4) is NOT V.

Letters already ruled out for position 4: G, V, O, T.

We need a single consonant that hasn’t been eliminated and forms a valid 5-letter word with S A R _ E.

Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, W, Y, etc.

Scanning the dictionary for SARBE, SARCE, SARDE, SARFE, SARHE, SARKE, SARM E, SARN E, SARPE, SARGE (invalid G), SARGE (invalid G), SARVE (invalid V), etc., the only valid word I can find is:

SARDE (a small fish, also a variant spelling in some contexts).

Let me check: SARDE is 5 letters, fits S A R _ E, and D hasn’t been eliminated yet.

Therefore, the next logical guess is SARDE.
