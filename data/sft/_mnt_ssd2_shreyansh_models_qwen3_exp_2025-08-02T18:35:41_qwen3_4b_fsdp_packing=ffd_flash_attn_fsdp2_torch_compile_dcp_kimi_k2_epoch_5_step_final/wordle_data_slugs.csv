### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

One of the most effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1
- L is correct in position 2
- A, T, E are not in the word at all

So the secret word starts with ""SL"" and does NOT contain A, T, or E.  
We still need to determine the last three letters.  
Good consonants and vowels left to try include: R, I, N, O, U, D, C, M, etc.  
A strong candidate is ""SLURD"" (but that’s not a common word).  
A more common word that fits is ""SLING"" – it uses common letters and avoids A, T, E.  
Let’s go with ""SLING"".

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ Word starts with “SL” and contains none of A, T, E.

2. SLING → S(✓) L(✓) I(x) N(x) G(-)  
   ⇒ Word starts with “SL” and still contains none of I, N.  
   ⇒ G is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- First two letters: S L _ _ _
- Must include G somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but not 5).
- Cannot contain A, E, I, N, T.

Remaining common letters to try: R, O, U, D, C, M, H, Y, etc.

A good candidate that fits:
- Starts with SL
- Contains G in position 3 or 4
- Uses only allowed letters

One such word is “SLUGG” (but double G may be unlikely).  
Another is “SLURG” (but R is allowed).  
A simpler common word is “SLUGG” isn’t valid.  
Wait – let’s pick “SLUG” plus one letter. Actually, let’s try “SLUG” plus a valid word.

A valid word that fits: SLUG_ – but we need 5 letters.  
Let’s try “SLUGG” isn’t valid.  
Let’s try “SLUG” plus a letter – no, we need 5 letters.

Let me think of a valid 5-letter word starting SL, containing G not in 5th position, and avoiding A,E,I,N,T.

“SLUG” is 4 letters.  
“SLUGG” is invalid.  
“SLUGS” – but S is already in 1st position, and we don’t know about S in 5th.  
But feedback shows S is correct in 1st position, but doesn’t say anything about S in 5th.

But we need to avoid A,E,I,N,T.

Let’s try “SLURG” – but R is allowed.  
But let’s pick a word that is common and fits: SLURG is uncommon.

Another candidate: “SLUG” + one letter – but we need 5 letters.

Let me think of “SLUG” + one letter: SLUGS – but S is already in 1st.  
But feedback didn’t rule out S in 5th, but we don’t know.  
But we have no info about S in 5th, so SLUGS is possible.

But let’s pick a word that is more common: “SLUGS” is possible, but let me think of another.

Actually, let’s try “SLUG” + one letter: SLUGS is 5 letters.  
But let me think of a word that is more common and fits: “SLUGS” is possible.

But let me think of another word: “SLUG” + one letter: “SLUGS” is valid.

But let me think of a word that is more common and fits: “SLUGS” is valid.

But let me think of a word that is more common: “SLUGS” is valid.

Actually, let me pick “SLUGS” as the next guess.

But let me check: SLUGS – letters S,L,U,G,S.  
We know S is correct in 1st position, but don’t know about 5th.  
We know L is correct in 2nd position.  
We know G is in the word but not in 5th position (so it must be 3rd or 4th).  
In SLUGS, G is 4th, which fits the feedback.  
Also, U is a new letter to test.  
This seems like a good next guess.

So my next guess is SLUGS.
