### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words.

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (but this has 4 vowels and might be too vowel-heavy)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for the first guess.

All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means every one of those letters can be eliminated from consideration.

To maximize information, I should pick a word that:
1. Avoids R, A, I, S, E entirely.
2. Uses other common letters that haven’t been tested yet, such as T, N, L, O, U, D, etc.
3. Contains no repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

A good candidate is “COUNT”:
- C, O, U, N, T are all new letters.
- It has 2 vowels (O, U) and 3 common consonants (C, N, T).
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words and should give useful feedback.

From the two guesses so far we know:

- Letters confirmed present and in the correct positions:
  – O in position 2  
  – U in position 3  
  – T in position 5  

So the word has the pattern: _ O U _ T

Remaining unused common letters (avoiding the eliminated set) include: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

To test as many possibilities as possible in one guess, I’ll choose a word that fills positions 1 and 4 with different letters from the remaining pool. A good choice is “FOULT”:

- F and L are both new letters.
- It keeps the confirmed O, U, T in their correct spots.
- It’s a valid 5-letter English word.

This should quickly narrow down the first and fourth letters.
