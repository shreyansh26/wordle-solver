### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - Letters L, T, E are not in the word.

2. CRASH → C(x) R(x) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
   - Confirms A is still in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4 (and we already knew it wasn't in position 1).
   - C, R, H are not in the word.

So the pattern is: _ _ A _ _
Letters known to be in the word: A (position 3), S (somewhere not 1 or 4)
Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, T, E, C, R, H

Remaining common letters to test: D, N, I, O, U, M, P, G, B, F, K, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 3.
- Contains S in either position 2 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).
- Uses only letters not yet excluded.

Possible candidates:
- S _ A _ _ (but S can't be in position 1, so this is invalid)
- _ S A _ _
- _ _ A _ S

Let's try ""BASIN"":
- B: new letter
- A: confirmed position 3
- S: in position 2 (valid)
- I: new vowel

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (cannot be 1st)
- L(x): L is not in the word at all
- A(✓): A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)
- T(x): T is not in the word
- E(x): E is not in the word

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Must contain S, but not in position 1
- Cannot contain L, T, or E
- Remaining letters to consider: common consonants (R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.) and vowels (I, O, U)

A good next guess should test new common letters while respecting the constraints. Let's try ""CRASH"":
- C: new consonant
- R: new consonant
- A: already confirmed in position 3
- S: known to be in word, now in position 4
- H: new consonant

This tests C, R, S (in new position), and H while keeping A in position 3.

From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - Letters L, T, E are not in the word.

2. CRASH → C(x) R(x) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
   - Confirms A is still in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4 (and we already knew it wasn't in position 1).
   - C, R, H are not in the word.

So the pattern is: _ _ A _ _
Letters known to be in the word: A (position 3), S (somewhere not 1 or 4)
Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, T, E, C, R, H

Remaining common letters to test: D, N, I, O, U, M, P, G, B, F, K, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 3.
- Contains S in either position 2 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).
- Uses only letters not yet excluded.

Possible candidates:
- S _ A _ _ (but S can't be in position 1, so this is invalid)
- _ S A _ _
- _ _ A _ S

Let's try ""BASIN"":
- B: new letter
- A: confirmed position 3
- S: in position 2 (valid)
- I: new vowel
- N: new consonant
Letters used: B, A, S, I, N - none are excluded.

This seems like a good test.

- Must contain S, but not in position 1
- Cannot contain L, T, or E
- Remaining letters to consider: common consonants (R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.) and vowels (I, O, U)

A good next guess should test new common letters while respecting the constraints. Let's try ""CRASH"":
- C: new consonant
- R: new consonant
- A: already confirmed in position 3
- S: known to be in word, now in position 4
- H: new consonant

This tests C, R, S (in new position), and H while keeping A in position 3.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRASH -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - Letters L, T, E are not in the word.

2. CRASH → C(x) R(x) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
   - Confirms A is still in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4 (and we already knew it wasn't in position 1).
   - C, R, H are not in the word.

So the pattern is: _ _ A _ _
Letters known to be in the word: A (position 3), S (somewhere not 1 or 4)
Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, T, E, C, R, H

Remaining common letters to test: D, N, I, O, U, M, P, G, B, F, K, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 3.
- Contains S in either position 2 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).
- Uses only letters not yet excluded.

Possible candidates:
- S _ A _ _ (but S can't be in position 1, so this is invalid)
- _ S A _ _
- _ _ A _ S

Let's try ""BASIN"":
- B: new letter
- A: confirmed position 3
- S: in position 2 (valid)
- I: new vowel
- N: new consonant
Letters used: B, A, S, I, N - none are excluded.

This seems like a good test.

From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4.

2. CRASH → C(x) R(x) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
   - Confirms A in position 3.
   - S is NOT in position 4 (already known).

3. BASIN → B(x) A(✓) S(-) I(x) N(x)
   - Confirms A in position 3.
   - S is NOT in position 3 (already known) and NOT in position 2.

So S must be in position 5.

Pattern: _ _ A _ S

Letters ruled out: L, T, E, C, R, H, B, I, N.

Remaining common letters: D, F, G, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a word with:
- A in position 3
- S in position 5
- Only letters from the remaining set.

Possible candidates:
- D A M A S → DAMAS (not a valid word)
- F A U S → FAUSS (not valid)
- M A C H S → already ruled out
- P A U S → PAUS (not valid)
- G A U S → GAUSS (valid word)

GAUSS:
- G: new letter
- A: position 3
- U: new letter
- S: position 5
- S: already known to be in word

Letters used: G, A, U, S, S - none are excluded.

DAMPS:
