For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters in different positions.

One excellent first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and vowels, which should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S
- Does NOT contain A, R, E
- O is not in position 3
- S is not in position 4

Next guess should:
1. Keep O and S
2. Introduce new common letters (T, L, N, I, C, etc.)
3. Avoid A, R, E
4. Put O and S in different positions

A good candidate is ""STOIC"":
- S in position 1 (new position)
- T (common)
- O in position 3 (but feedback said O is not in position 3, so this is bad)

Oops, O can't be in position 3. Let's try ""SONIC"":
- S in position 1
- O in position 2 (new position)
- N, I, C are new common letters

This seems better.

Let's digest the new feedback on SONIC:

S(-)  → S is in the word but NOT in position 1  
O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 2  
N(x) → N is NOT in the word  
I(-) → I is in the word but NOT in position 4  
C(x) → C is NOT in the word  

Summary of what we know so far:
- Letters that MUST appear: S, O, I  
- Letters that MUST NOT appear: A, R, E, N, C  
- Forbidden positions:
  – S ≠ 1  
  – O ≠ 2  
  – I ≠ 4  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, O, I exactly once each  
- Does NOT contain A, R, E, N, C  
- Places S, O, I in allowed positions  

Let’s list possible positions for each required letter:

S: allowed in 2,3,4,5  
O: allowed in 1,3,4,5  
I: allowed in 1,2,3,5  

We still need two more letters, which must come from the remaining common consonants that have not been ruled out. The unused common consonants are: D, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should test new positions for S, O, I and introduce fresh common consonants.  
Consider the word “DOWIS” (but W is less common).  
Consider “STOIC” – already used.  
Consider “SOILD” – uses D, but L is allowed.  
Consider “SPOIL” – uses P, L.  

“SPOIL”:
- S in 1 – forbidden (feedback said S not in 1) → reject.  
“SOILD” – S in 1 → reject.  
“SOLID” – S in 1 → reject.  
“SPOIL” – S in 1 → reject.  
“SOLID” – same.  

Try “DISOY” – Y is less common.  
Try “TOSHI” – H is allowed, but I is in 4 → forbidden.  

Try “SLOTH” – S in 1 → reject.  
Try “SPOOK” – K is allowed, but O is in 2 → reject.  
Try “STOIC” – already used.  

Try “SPOIL” – already saw S in 1 is bad.  

Try “SPOIL” again: S in 1 is bad.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters in different positions.

One excellent first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and vowels, which should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S
- Does NOT contain A, R, E
- O is not in position 3
- S is not in position 4

Next guess should:
1. Keep O and S
2. Introduce new common letters (T, L, N, I, C, etc.)
3. Avoid A, R, E
4. Put O and S in different positions

A good candidate is ""STOIC"":
- S in position 1 (new position)
- T (common)
- O in position 3 (but feedback said O is not in position 3, so this is bad)

Oops, O can't be in position 3. Let's try ""SONIC"":
- S in position 1
- O in position 2 (new position)
- N, I, C are new common letters

This seems better.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters in different positions.

One excellent first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and vowels, which should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S
- Does NOT contain A, R, E
- O is not in position 3
- S is not in position 4

Next guess should:
1. Keep O and S
2. Introduce new common letters (T, L, N, I, C, etc.)
3. Avoid A, R, E
4. Put O and S in different positions

A good candidate is ""STOIC"":
- S in position 1 (new position)
- T (common)
- O in position 3 (but feedback said O is not in position 3, so this is bad)

Oops, O can't be in position 3. Let's try ""SONIC"":
- S in position 1
- O in position 2 (new position)
- N, I, C are new common letters

From the latest feedback on LOUIS:

- L(✓) → L is in the word and in the correct position (first letter).
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- U(x) → U is NOT in the word.
- I(-) → I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).

So we now know:
- Word starts with L and ends with S.
- Contains O and I somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since O can’t be in 2 and I can’t be in 4).
- Does NOT contain A, R, E, N, C, D, U.

Letters still allowed: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O and I.

We need a 5-letter word of the form L _ _ _ S that includes both O and I exactly once each, with O not in position 2 and I not in position 4.

Possible positions for O and I:
- O could be in 3 or 4.
- I could be in 2 or 3 (but not 4).

Let’s list possible combinations:

1. L I O _ S → but then position 4 is empty, and we need another letter.
   - L I O _ S → need a 4th letter that is allowed. Possible: L I O T S → “LIOTS” (not a word), L I O H S → “LIHOS” (not a word).

2. L I _ O S → I in 2, O in 4.
   - L I _ O S → need a 3rd letter. Possible: L I T O S → “LITOS” (not a word), L I M O S → “LIMOS” (valid word).

3. L _ I O S → I in 3, O in 4.
   - L _ I O S → need a 2nd letter. Possible: L B I O S → “LBIOS” (not a word), L P I O S → “LPIOS” (not a word).

4. L O I _ S → O in 2 (but feedback says O is NOT in 2), so discard.

5. L _ O I S → O in 3, I in 4 (but I can’t be in 4), so discard.

6. L O _ I S → O in 2 (invalid), so discard.

The only valid candidate that fits all constraints is “LIMOS”.

Check:
- L(1) ✓
- I(2) allowed (not in 4)
- M(3) allowed
- O(4) allowed (not in 2)
- S(5) ✓
- Contains both I and O.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, E, N, C, D, U).
- Valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, the next guess should be LIMOS.
