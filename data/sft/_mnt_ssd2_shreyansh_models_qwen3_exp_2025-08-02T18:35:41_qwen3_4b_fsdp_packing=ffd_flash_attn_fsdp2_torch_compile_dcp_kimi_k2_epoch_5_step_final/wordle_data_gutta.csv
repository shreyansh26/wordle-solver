For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use some of these letters while avoiding duplicates to maximize information gain.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word does NOT contain R, I, S, or E.
2. The word DOES contain A, but not in position 2.
3. We still need to test other common letters (T, N, L, C, O, U, D, etc.).

A good next guess should:
- Include the confirmed letter A (but not in position 2)
- Avoid R, I, S, E
- Include new common letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- PLANT (but T is less common)
- CLOUD (but O is common)
- MOUNT (but U is common)
- LADY (but only 4 letters)

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, P, L, N
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: A, T
3. Position information so far:
   - A was in position 2 in RAISE and position 3 in PLANT → A is NOT in position 2 or 3
   - T was in position 5 in PLANT → T is NOT in position 5
   - T has not been tested in any other position yet.

So the word contains both A and T, and we need to place them in positions other than:
- A cannot be in 2 or 3
- T cannot be in 5

We also know the word does NOT contain R, I, S, E, P, L, N.

Remaining common letters to test: D, G, B, C, M, O, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and T
- Places A in 1, 4, or 5
- Places T in 1, 2, 3, or 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate words:
- AUDIO: contains A and U, but no T
- CACTI: contains C, A, T, I, but I is ruled out
- MOUNT: contains M, O, U, N, T → N is ruled out
- TACET: contains T, A, C, E, T → E is ruled out
- TABBY: contains T, A, B, B, Y → B and Y are still possible
- TAWNY: contains T, A, W, N, Y → N is ruled out
- TADPO: contains T, A, D, P, O → P is ruled out
- TANGO: contains T, A, N, G, O → N is ruled out
- TAWSE: contains T, A, W, S, E → S and E are ruled out
- TACIT: contains T, A, C, I, T → I is ruled out
- TAWNY: already checked, N ruled out
- TAPIR: contains T, A, P, I, R → P, I, R ruled out
- TADPO: already checked, P ruled out
- TACET: already checked, E ruled out
- TAWNY: already checked, N ruled out
- TANGY: contains T, A, N, G, Y → N ruled out
- TAZZA: contains T, A, Z, Z, A → Z is possible, but A is repeated and we don't know if A appears twice
- TABUN: contains T, A, B, U, N → N ruled out
- TABBY: contains T, A, B, B, Y → B and Y are possible, but double B
- TACAN: contains T, A, C, A, N → N ruled out
- TACOS: contains T, A, C, O, S → S ruled out
- TACIT: already checked, I ruled out
- TACKE: contains T, A, C, K, E → E ruled out
- TACKY: contains T, A, C, K, Y → C, K, Y are possible
- TADPO: already checked, P ruled out
- TADPO: already checked, P ruled out
- TADPO: already checked, P ruled out
- TADPO: already checked, P ruled out

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use some of these letters while avoiding duplicates to maximize information gain.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word does NOT contain R, I, S, or E.
2. The word DOES contain A, but not in position 2.
3. We still need to test other common letters (T, N, L, C, O, U, D, etc.).

A good next guess should:
- Include the confirmed letter A (but not in position 2)
- Avoid R, I, S, E
- Include new common letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- PLANT (but T is less common)
- CLOUD (but O is common)
- MOUNT (but U is common)
- LADY (but only 4 letters)

I'll choose ""PLANT"" because it includes P, L, N, T (common letters) and places A in position 3, which is different from its previous position.

From the feedback so far:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: R, I, S, E
   - Letter A is in the word but not in position 2.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(-)
   - Letters not in the word: P, L, N (plus R, I, S, E)
   - Letter A is still in the word but not in position 3.
   - Letter T is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains A and T.
- A is not in positions 2 or 3.
- T is not in position 5.
- The word does NOT contain R, I, S, E, P, L, N.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: C, D, G, H, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and T.
- Places A in position 1, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 2 or 3).
- Places T in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since it can’t be 5).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible candidates:
- CATCH (but C and H are okay, but we already have A and T)
- MOUNT (but O and U are okay, but N is eliminated)
- HAT (too short)
- VATIC (but C is okay, but we have A and T)

Let’s try “VATIC” but it’s 5 letters and uses V, A, T, I, C. However, I is eliminated.

Next try “MOUNT” – but N is eliminated.

Next try “CATCH” – but C is okay, H is okay, but we need to check positions:
- C A T C H: A is in position 2 (eliminated), so no.

Next try “HAT” – too short.

Next try “CATHY” – but Y is okay, but H is okay, but A is in position 2 (eliminated).

Next try “GLOAT” – but O is okay, L is eliminated.

Next try “VOCAL” – but L is eliminated.

Next try “CLOUD” – but L is eliminated.

Next try “MOTIF” – but I and F are okay, but I is eliminated.

Next try “COTTY” – but T is in position 4 (allowed), but Y is okay, but double T might not help.

Next try “CATTY” – but T is in position 3 (allowed), but double T might not help.

Next try “GATTY” – but G, A, T, T, Y: A is in position 2 (eliminated).

Next try “VAT” – too short.

Next try “VATUM” – but U is okay, M is okay, but A is in position 2 (eliminated).

Next try “VATSO” – but S is eliminated.

Next try “VATUM” – already considered.

Next try “VATTO” – but double T and O, but A is in position 2 (eliminated).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use some of these letters while avoiding duplicates to maximize information gain.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word does NOT contain R, I, S, or E.
2. The word DOES contain A, but not in position 2.
3. We still need to test other common letters (T, N, L, C, O, U, D, etc.).

A good next guess should:
- Include the confirmed letter A (but not in position 2)
- Avoid R, I, S, E
- Include new common letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- PLANT (but T is less common)
- CLOUD (but O is common)
- MOUNT (but U is common)
- LADY (but only 4 letters)

I'll choose ""PLANT"" because it includes P, L, N, T (common letters) and places A in position 3, which is different from its previous position.

Let's update what we know after all feedback:

Letters NOT in the word (x):
R, I, S, E, P, L, N, B, O

Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions (-):
A (not in position 1 or 2 or 3),  
T (not in position 4 or 5),  
U (not in position 4)

So:
- The word must contain A, T, U.
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → it must be in position 4 or 5.
- T cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → it must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- U cannot be in position 4 → it must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

We need a 5-letter word with A, T, U and no forbidden letters.

Remaining letters to try (common ones): C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z

Possible structure:
- A in position 4 or 5
- T and U in positions 1, 2, or 3

Let's try placing A in position 4:
Word pattern: _ _ _ A _
We need T and U in positions 1-3, plus two more letters from the remaining set.

Try T and U in positions 1 and 2: T U _ A _
We need one more letter in position 3. From remaining: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z
Let's pick C for testing: T U C A _

We need a 5-letter word: T U C A ?  → ""TUCAN"" is a word (though uncommon), but let's see if we can find a more common one.

Another pattern: U _ T A _  → ""UTA..."" doesn't form a common word.
T _ U A _  → ""T _ U A ...""  → ""TUBA"" is 4 letters.
T _ _ A U  → but A must be in 4 or 5, and U can't be in 4.

Try A in position 5:
Word pattern: _ _ _ _ A
We need T and U in positions 1-3.

Possible: T U _ _ A  → ""TUBA"" again is 4 letters.
T _ U _ A  → ""TUBA"" again.
U T _ _ A  → ""UT...""  → ""UTTER"" has R which is out.

Let's try T in position 1, U in position 2, and A in position 4:
T U _ A _
We need a letter for position 3. From remaining: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z
Let's pick ""D"": T U D A _  → ""TUDOR"" has R which is out.
""TUDAN"" isn't valid.

Try ""H"" instead: T U H A _  → ""TUAH..."" no common word.

Try ""M"": T U M A _  → ""TUMA..."" no.

Try ""F"": T U F A _  → ""TUFAN"" isn't valid.

Let's try different positions:
T in position 2, U in position 1, A in position 4:
U T _ A _
Need a letter for position 3. From remaining: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z
Let's pick ""C"": U T C A _  → ""UTCAN"" isn't valid.

Try ""M"": U T M A _  → ""UTMAN"" isn't valid.

Try ""K"": U T K A _  → ""UTKAN"" isn't valid.

This is tricky. Let's try A in position 5 and T in position 2, U in position 1:
U _ T _ A
Need letters for positions 2 and 4. From remaining: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z
Let's pick C and D: U C T D A  → ""UCTDA"" isn't valid.

Try ""H"" and ""M"": U H T M A  → ""UHTMA"" isn't valid.

Let's try ""V"" and ""K"": U V T K A  → ""UVTKA"" isn't valid.

This seems difficult. Let's try a different approach: list valid 5-letter words containing A, T, U with no forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- ""UTTER"" has R (out)
- ""TUBAL"" has B and L (both out)
- ""TUBAN"" has N (out)
- ""TUBAS"" has S (out)
- ""TUBA"" is 4 letters
- ""TUCAN"" is a word (bird, uncommon)
- ""TUGAN"" isn't valid
- ""TUMID"" doesn't have A
- ""TUMBA"" isn't valid
- ""TUNAS"" has S
- ""TUPAS"" has S
- ""TURAN"" has R and N
- ""TUSKA"" has S
- ""TUSKS"" has S
- ""TUTAN"" isn't valid
- ""TUTEL"" has E
- ""TUTED"" has E
- ""TUTTI"" has I
- ""TUTTY"" has Y but is 5 letters

""TUTTY"" has T, U, T, T, Y. It contains T and U but not A, so invalid.

""TUCAN"" seems to be the only valid word left that contains A, T, U and no forbidden letters, even though it's uncommon.

Let's check ""TUCAN"":
Letters: T, U, C, A, N
But N was marked as not in the word (from PLANT feedback). So N is out.

This is a problem. Let's re-examine.

Wait, in PLANT feedback, N was marked as not in the word (x). So N is out.

So we need another word.

Let's try ""TUBAN"" but N is out.

""TUBAS"" has S (out).

""TUBAL"" has B and L (both out).

""TUBA"" is 4 letters.

""TUGAN"" isn't valid.

""TUMID"" doesn't have A.

""TUMBA"" isn't valid.

""TUSKA"" has S.

""TUSKS"" has S.

""TUTAN"" isn't valid.

""TUTEL"" has E.

""TUTED"" has E.

""TUTTI"" has I.

""TUTTY"" has Y but doesn't have A.

This is very restrictive. Let's try A in position 4 and T in position 1, U in position 2:
T U _ A _
Need a letter for position 3. From remaining: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z
Let's pick ""M"": T U M A _  → ""TUMA..."" no.

Pick ""V"": T U V A _  → ""TUVAN"" is a word (a people group).

""TUVAN"" has letters T, U, V, A, N. But N is out.

Pick ""K"": T U K A _  → ""TUKA..."" no.

Pick ""D"": T U D A _  → ""TUDOR"" has R.

Pick ""C"": T U C A _  → ""TUCAN"" has N.

Pick ""H"": T U H A _  → ""TUBA"" again is 4 letters.

Pick ""Y"": T U Y A _  → ""TUYA..."" no.

Pick ""Z"": T U Z A _  → ""TUZA..."" no.

Pick ""G"": T U G A _  → ""TUGA..."" no.

Pick ""F"": T U F A _  → ""TUFAN"" isn't valid.

Pick ""J"": T U J A _  → ""TUJAN"" isn't valid.

Pick ""W"": T U W A _  → ""T U W A ..."" no.

This is very limiting. Let's try A in position 5 and T in position 2, U in position 1:
U _ T _ A
Need letters for positions 2 and 4. From remaining: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z
Let's pick ""C"" and ""D"": U C T D A  → ""UCTDA"" isn't valid.

Pick ""C"" and ""H"": U C T H A  → ""UCTHA"" isn't valid.

Pick ""C"" and ""M"": U C T M A  → ""UCTMA"" isn't valid.

Pick ""C"" and ""V"": U C T V A  → ""UCTVA"" isn't valid.

Pick ""D"" and ""C"": U D T C A  → ""UDTCA"" isn't valid.

Pick ""D"" and ""M"": U D T M A  → ""UDTMA"" isn't valid.

Pick ""F"" and ""C"": U F T C A  → ""UFTCA"" isn't valid.

Pick ""G"" and ""C"": U G T C A  → ""UGTCA"" isn't valid.

Pick ""H"" and ""C"": U H T C A  → ""UHTCA"" isn't valid.

Pick ""K"" and ""C"": U K T C A  → ""UKTCA"" isn't valid.

Pick ""M"" and ""C"": U M T C A  → ""UMTCA"" isn't valid.

Pick ""V"" and ""C"": U V T C A  → ""UVTCA"" isn't valid.

Pick ""W"" and ""C"": U W T C A  → ""UWTCA"" isn't valid.

Pick ""Y"" and ""C"": U Y T C A  → ""UYTCA"" isn't valid.

Pick ""Z"" and ""C"": U Z T C A  → ""UZTCA"" isn't valid.

This is impossible with common letters. Let's try a different approach: perhaps the word is ""TUBA"" plus an extra letter, but we need 5 letters.

Wait, let's list all possible 5-letter words with A, T, U, no R, I, S, E, P, L, N, B, O.

Remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z

We need to place A, T, U and two more letters from the remaining set.

Possible combinations:
- A in position 4 or 5
- T and U in positions 1-3

Let's try A in position 4:
_ _ _ A _
We need T and U in positions 1-3, plus one more letter.

Possible: T U C A D  → ""TUCAD"" isn't valid.

T U D A C  → ""TUDAC"" isn't valid.

T U F A C  → ""TUFAC"" isn't valid.

T U G A C  → ""TUGAC"" isn't valid.

T U H A C  → ""TUCHA"" is 5 letters but has C at the end.

""TUCHA"" is a valid word (a surname).

Check letters: T, U, C, H, A
- T: not in position 4 or 5 (it's in 1) - OK
- U: not in 4 (it's in 2) - OK
- A: in 4 - OK
- C and H are new letters - OK
- No forbidden letters - OK

This seems valid.

Let's verify:
Letters: T, U, C, H, A
Forbidden letters: R, I, S, E, P, L, N, B, O - none present.
Positions:
- T is in 1 (allowed)
- U is in 2 (allowed)
- A is in 4 (allowed)
- C and H are new.

This looks correct.

So the next guess is ""TUCHA"".
