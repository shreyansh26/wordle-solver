### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE has A, R, O, S, E
- ADIEU has A, D, I, E, U

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

- S is not in the word at all (x)
- E is in the correct fifth position (✓)

So the secret word has the exact form: A _ O R E

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with A, has O in position 3, R in position 4, and E in position 5. The missing letter is in position 2.

Possible consonants for position 2: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc.

Checking common words:
- ABORE – not valid
- ACORE – valid (short for “core sample”)
- AFIRE – not matching the pattern
- AGORE – not valid
- AMORE – valid (Spanish loanword meaning “love”)
- ANGER – not matching the pattern (R is in position 4 here, but E is in position 5)
- APHRE – not valid

The two valid options are ACORE and AMORE. Between these, ACORE is more commonly recognized in English word lists, so I’ll guess ACORE.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". \n\nLooking at these options:\n- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E\n- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E\n- AROSE has A, R, O, S, E\n- ADIEU has A, D, I, E, U\n\nAmong these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word. \n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is in the correct first position (✓)\n- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n- O is in the correct third position (✓)\n- S is not in the word at all (x)\n- E is in the correct fifth position (✓)\n\nSo the pattern so far is: A _ O _ E\nWe know R must appear somewhere in the remaining two blanks (positions 2 or 4), but not in position 2 (because it was marked wrong position in AROSE).

From all feedback so far we have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)  
   Pattern: A _ O _ E

2. ADORE → A(✓) D(x) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)  
   Pattern: A _ O R E

3. ACORE → A(✓) C(x) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)  
   Pattern: A _ O R E (confirms C is not in position 2)

So the word must be A _ O R E, and the missing letter in position 2 is not A, C, D, S.

Common consonants left for position 2: B, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc.

Valid English 5-letter words fitting A _ O R E:
- ABORE – archaic, obscure  
- AMORE – Italian loanword, uncommon in standard Scrabble/Wordle lists  
- ANGEL – doesn’t fit pattern  
- AFORE – valid (means “before”)  
- AFIRE – doesn’t fit pattern (R is 4th, E 5th)  
- AFORE is the only common English word that fits.

Hence the only plausible guess is AFORE.
