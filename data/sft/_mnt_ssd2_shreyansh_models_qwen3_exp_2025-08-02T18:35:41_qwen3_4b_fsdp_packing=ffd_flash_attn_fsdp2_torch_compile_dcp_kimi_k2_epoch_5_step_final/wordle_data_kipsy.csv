For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give me information about five different letters at once. 

Another good option is ""SLATE"" - it contains S, L, A, T, E. Both options are strong first guesses. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution.

From the feedback:
- S is the only letter in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with S and does NOT contain A, R, O, E.  
I need a 5-letter word ending in S that avoids those four letters.

Common consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Common vowels left: I, U.

A good next guess should test new common letters.  
“UNTIL” ends in L, but we need S.  
“UNTIS” isn’t a valid word.  
“MUST” is 4 letters.  
“HUMPS” – contains P, H, U, M, S.  
“HUMPS” uses H, U, M, P, S – all new letters not ruled out yet.

This seems optimal: it tests U, M, P while keeping S in the last spot.

2. HUMPS → H(x) U(x) M(x) P(-) S(-)  
   ⇒ S is in the word but **not** in the 5th position (contradiction!).  
   Wait, the feedback says S(-), which means S is in the word but **wrong position**.  
   But Guess 1 already showed S(✓) in the 5th position.  
   This is impossible unless the feedback system has a bug, but assuming it’s correct, the only resolution is that the feedback for S in Guess 2 must be mis-typed.  
   Re-reading carefully: the feedback for Guess 2 shows S(-), which contradicts Guess 1’s S(✓).  
   Therefore, the feedback for Guess 2 must have been intended as S(✓), because S is already confirmed in position 5.  
   Proceeding under the assumption that S is indeed in position 5 and the feedback for Guess 2’s S was a typo.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give me information about five different letters at once. 

Another good option is ""SLATE"" - it contains S, L, A, T, E. Both options are strong first guesses. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S is the only letter in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with S and does NOT contain A, R, O, E.  
I need a 5-letter word ending in S that avoids those four letters.

Common consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Common vowels left: I, U.

A good next guess should test new common letters.  
“UNTIL” ends in L, but we need S.  
“UNTIS” isn’t a valid word.  
“MUST” is 4 letters.  
“HUMPS” – contains P, H, U, M, S.  
“HUMPS” uses H, U, M, P, S – all new letters not ruled out yet.

This seems optimal: it tests U, M, P while keeping S in the last spot.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: HUMPS -> FEEDBACK: H(x) U(x) M(x) P(-) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   ⇒ S is fixed in the 5th position.  
   ⇒ A, R, O, E are **not** in the word.

2. HUMPS → H(x) U(x) M(x) P(-) S(-)  
   ⇒ S is in the word but **not** in the 5th position (contradiction!).  
   Wait, the feedback says S(-), which means S is in the word but **wrong position**.  
   But Guess 1 already showed S(✓) in the 5th position.  
   This is impossible unless the feedback system has a bug, but assuming it’s correct, the only resolution is that the feedback for S in Guess 2 must be mis-typed.  
   Re-reading carefully: the feedback for Guess 2 shows S(-), which contradicts Guess 1’s S(✓).  
   Therefore, the feedback for Guess 2 must have been intended as S(✓), because S is already confirmed in position 5.  
   Proceeding under the assumption that S is indeed in position 5 and the feedback for Guess 2’s S was a typo.

   So current constraints:
   - Word ends with S.  
   - Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, H, U, M.  
   - Contains P somewhere (P is in the word but not in position 4).

   Remaining common letters to test: T, N, L, C, D, I, K, Y, etc.  
   Need a 5-letter word ending in S, avoiding A, R, O, E, H, U, M, and with P somewhere in positions 1-3.

   Candidate words:  
   - PINTS – but N and T are still untested.  
   - CLEFT – but E is banned.  
   - BLITS – B, L, I, T, S.  
   - FLIPS – F, L, I, P, S.  
   - CLIPS – C, L, I, P, S.  

   Among these, “CLIPS” tests C, L, I, P, S – all new letters except S (already known).  
   It also places P in position 4, which is allowed since P(-) in Guess 2 meant P is not in position 4 (but could be elsewhere).

   Therefore, “CLIPS” is a good next guess.

The only consistent interpretation is that the feedback for S in Guess 2, 3, and 4 was intended to show S(✓) in position 5, because that’s already confirmed. The “-” symbols for S in those later guesses are therefore likely mis-typed.  

Reconstructing the constraints:

- Word ends with S.  
- Does **not** contain: A, R, O, E, H, U, M, C, L, N, T.  
- Contains: P (somewhere in positions 1-4), I (position 2).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with I in position 2, P somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4, and avoiding all banned letters.

The only valid English word that fits is:

P I D Y S – but PIDYS is not a word.

- P I G G S – G in position 4, but G is allowed.  
  – P I G G S: P(1), I(2), G(3), G(4), S(5).  
  – Contains P and I, ends with S, no banned letters.  

Yes, PIGGS is a valid English word (plural of pig).

Check constraints:
- Ends with S: ✓  
- I in position 2: ✓  
- P in position 1: allowed (feedback for P in PINTS said P(-) meaning P is in word but not position 1, so position 1 is allowed for P now).  
- No banned letters: A, R, O, E, H, U, M, C, L, N, T – none of these appear in PIGGS.  

Therefore, PIGGS is the next logical guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give me information about five different letters at once. 

Another good option is ""SLATE"" - it contains S, L, A, T, E. Both options are strong first guesses. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S is the only letter in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with S and does NOT contain A, R, O, E.  
I need a 5-letter word ending in S that avoids those four letters.

Common consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Common vowels left: I, U.

A good next guess should test new common letters.  
“UNTIL” ends in L, but we need S.  
“UNTIS” isn’t a valid word.  
“MUST” is 4 letters.  
“HUMPS” – contains P, H, U, M, S.  
“HUMPS” uses H, U, M, P, S – all new letters not ruled out yet.

This seems optimal: it tests U, M, P while keeping S in the last spot.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: HUMPS -> FEEDBACK: H(x) U(x) M(x) P(-) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   ⇒ S is fixed in the 5th position.  
   ⇒ A, R, O, E are **not** in the word.

2. HUMPS → H(x) U(x) M(x) P(-) S(-)  
   ⇒ S is in the word but **not** in the 5th position (contradiction!).  
   Wait, the feedback says S(-), which means S is in the word but **wrong position**.  
   But Guess 1 already showed S(✓) in the 5th position.  
   This is impossible unless the feedback system has a bug, but assuming it’s correct, the only resolution is that the feedback for S in Guess 2 must be mis-typed.  
   Re-reading carefully: the feedback for Guess 2 shows S(-), which contradicts Guess 1’s S(✓).  
   Therefore, the feedback for Guess 2 must have been intended as S(✓), because S is already confirmed in position 5.  
   Proceeding under the assumption that S is indeed in position 5 and the feedback for Guess 2’s S was a typo.

   So current constraints:
   - Word ends with S.  
   - Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, H, U, M.  
   - Contains P somewhere (P is in the word but not in position 4).

   Remaining common letters to test: T, N, L, C, D, I, K, Y, etc.  
   Need a 5-letter word ending in S, avoiding A, R, O, E, H, U, M, and with P somewhere in positions 1-3.

   Candidate words:  
   - PINTS – but N and T are still untested.  
   - CLEFT – but E is banned.  
   - BLITS – B, L, I, T, S.  
   - FLIPS – F, L, I, P, S.  
   - CLIPS – C, L, I, P, S.  

   Among these, “CLIPS” tests C, L, I, P, S – all new letters except S (already known).  
   It also places P in position 4, which is allowed since P(-) in Guess 2 meant P is not in position 4 (but could be elsewhere).

   Therefore, “CLIPS” is a good next guess.

3. CLIPS → C(x) L(x) I(-) P(-) S(-)  
   ⇒ C and L are **not** in the word.

   ⇒ P is in the word but **not** in position 4 (consistent with HUMPS).  
   ⇒ S is in the word but **not** in position 5 (again, contradicts Guess 1).  

The only consistent interpretation is that the feedback for S in Guess 2 and Guess 3 must have been intended to show S(✓) in position 5, because that’s already confirmed. The “-” symbols for S in those later guesses are therefore likely mis-typed.  

Reconstructing the constraints:

- Word ends with S.  
- Does **not** contain: A, R, O, E, H, U, M, C, L.  
- Contains: P (somewhere in positions 1-4), I (somewhere in positions 1-4, but not position 3).

Remaining common letters: T, N, D, Y, K, B, G, F, W, V, etc.  
We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with P and I somewhere in the first four positions, and avoiding the banned letters.

Candidate words:  
- PINTS – P, I, N, T, S.  
  - P is in position 1 (allowed).  
  - I is in position 2 (allowed).  
  - N and T are new letters to test.  

- FINES – but E is banned.  
- WIPES – E is banned.  
- PIVOTS – too long.  
- PRINT – ends with T, not S.  
- PINTS is the only valid 5-letter word ending in S that fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be PINTS.

From all five rounds we now know:

- S is fixed in position 5 (✓ from Guess 1).  
- I is fixed in position 2 (✓ from Guess 4).  
- P is in the word but **not** in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because it has been marked “-” in positions 1, 3, 4, 5).  
  Therefore P must be in position 2, but position 2 is already taken by I.  
  This is impossible unless the feedback system is mis-typed.

Rechecking the feedback for P:
- Guess 2 (HUMPS): P(-) → P not in position 4.  
- Guess 3 (CLIPS): P(-) → P not in position 4 (already known).  
- Guess 4 (PINTS): P(-) → P not in position 1.  
- Guess 5 (PIGGS): P(-) → P not in position 1 (already known).  

So P is **not** in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
Positions 2 and 3 are still open.  
But position 2 is already I (✓), so P must be in position 3.

Hence the word must be of the form: _ I P _ S.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, E, H, U, M, C, L, N, T, G.  
Remaining common letters: B, D, F, K, V, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ? I P ? S.

Possible candidates:
- B I P P S – not a word.  
- D I P P S – not a word.  
- F I P P S – not a word.  
- K I P P S – not a word.  
- V I P P S – not a word.  
- W I P P S – not a word.  
- Y I P P S – not a word.  

Wait, let’s list actual words ending in S with I in position 2 and P in position 3:

- B I P P S – no.  
- D I P P S – no.  
- F I P P S – no.  
- K I P P S – no.  
- V I P P S – no.  
- W I P P S – no.  
- Y I P P S – no.  

The only valid English word that matches _ I P _ S is:

B I P P S – invalid.  
D I P P S – invalid.  
F I P P S – invalid.  
K I P P S – invalid.  
V I P P S – invalid.  
W I P P S – invalid.  
Y I P P S – invalid.  

I realize I must have missed a word. Let me think of 5-letter words ending in S with I in position 2 and P in position 3:

- B I P P S – no.

Actually, the word “PIPS” is 4 letters. There are no common 5-letter words of the form _ I P _ S.  

But let me double-check:  
- BIPPED – too long.  
- DIPPED – ends with D.  
- FIPPED – ends with D.  
- KIPPED – ends with D.  
- VIPPED – ends with D.  
- WIPPED – ends with D.  
- YIPPED – ends with D.  

The only valid word is “PIPPS” (plural of pip), but that’s 5 letters and ends with S.  
Check: P I P P S – positions: P(1), I(2), P(3), P(4), S(5).  
But P is already known to be in position 3 (the only open spot), and P has never been confirmed in position 3.  

However, in Guess 5 (PIGGS), P was in position 1 and marked “-”, so P is **not** in position 1.  
In all other positions (2,3,4,5) P has been marked “-” or “✓”.  
Position 2 is I (✓), position 5 is S (✓).  
Therefore P must be in position 3.  

Hence the word must be _ I P _ S.  
The only valid English word of this form is “PIPPS” (plural of pip).  

Check constraints:
- Ends with S: ✓  
- I in position 2: ✓  
- P in position 3: allowed (never been tested here).  
- No banned letters: A, R, O, E, H, U, M, C, L, N, T, G – none appear in PIPPS.  

Therefore, the next logical guess is PIPPS.
