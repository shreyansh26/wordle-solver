For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these. 

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 5).
- R, I, S are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and E, but not R, I, S.
- A is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Does not contain R, I, S.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Let’s try “PLATE”:
- P, L, T are new letters.
- A is in position 3 (not 1).
- E is in position 5 (but feedback said E is not in position 5, so this is bad).

Next try “ELATE”:
- E in position 1 (new position).
- L, A, T are new letters.

- A in position 2 (new position).
- L in position 3 (new).
- O in position 4 (new).
- N in position 5 (new).
But we know E must be present, so this is invalid.

Next try “EATON”:
- E in position 1 (new).
- A in position 2 (new).
- T, O, N are new.
- Contains both A and E, no R, I, S.
- E is not in position 5, A is not in position 1.
This seems valid.

Another option is “ELOPE”:
- E in position 1 and 5 (but E can’t be in 5).
So invalid.

Next try “EPOCH”:
- E in 1, P, O, C, H new.
- Contains E and no A, so invalid.

- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 5).
- R, I, S are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and E, but not R, I, S.
- A is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Does not contain R, I, S.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Good candidate letters to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, U, O, Y, etc.

Let’s try “PLATE”:
- P, L, T are new letters.
- A is in position 3 (not 1).
- E is in position 5 (but feedback said E is not in position 5, so this is bad).

Next try “ELATE”:
- E in position 1 (new position).
- L, A, T are new letters.
- A in position 2 (new position).
- E in position 5 (still bad).

Next try “TALON”:
- T, O, N are new letters.
- A in position 2 (new position).
- L in position 3 (new).
- O in position 4 (new).
- N in position 5 (new).
But we know E must be present, so this is invalid.

Next try “EATON”:
- E in position 1 (new).
- A in position 2 (new).
- T, O, N are new.
- Contains both A and E, no R, I, S.
- E is not in position 5, A is not in position 1.
This seems valid.

Another option is “ELOPE”:
- E in position 1 and 5 (but E can’t be in 5).
So invalid.

Next try “EPOCH”:
- E in 1, P, O, C, H new.
- Contains E and no A, so invalid.

Next try “EATEN”:
- E in 1 and 5 (invalid).

Next try “EAGLE”:
- E in 1 and 5 (invalid).

Next try “EATLY”:
- E in 1, A in 2, T, L, Y new.
- Contains A and E, no R, I, S.
- E is not in 5, A is not in 1.
This seems valid.

Between “EATON” and “EATLY”, “EATON” has more common letters.

Let’s go with “EATON”.

From the new feedback on EATON:

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ A _ _ _
- It contains E, but E is not in position 1.
- It does not contain R, I, S, T, O, N.

Letters we have used and eliminated: R, I, S, T, O, N.
Letters we have confirmed: A (position 2), E (somewhere else).

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A fixed in position 2.
- E somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- No R, I, S, T, O, N.

Possible candidates:
- CABLE: C, A, B, L, E – A is correct, E is in position 5 (allowed), no banned letters.
- MABLE: M, A, B, L, E – same as above.
- PABLE: P, A, B, L, E – same.
- DABLE: D, A, B, L, E – same.

CABLE seems like the most common word among these.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these. 

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 5).
- R, I, S are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and E, but not R, I, S.
- A is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Does not contain R, I, S.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Good candidate letters to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, U, O, Y, etc.

Let’s try “PLATE”:
- P, L, T are new letters.
- A is in position 3 (not 1).
- E is in position 5 (but feedback said E is not in position 5, so this is bad).

Next try “ELATE”:
- E in position 1 (new position).
- L, A, T are new letters.
- A in position 2 (new position).
- E in position 5 (still bad).

Next try “TALON”:
- T, O, N are new letters.
- A in position 2 (new position).
- L in position 3 (new).
- O in position 4 (new).
- N in position 5 (new).
But we know E must be present, so this is invalid.

Next try “EATON”:
- E in position 1 (new).
- A in position 2 (new).
- T, O, N are new.
- Contains both A and E, no R, I, S.
- E is not in position 5, A is not in position 1.
This seems valid.

Another option is “ELOPE”:
- E in position 1 and 5 (but E can’t be in 5).
So invalid.

Next try “EPOCH”:
- E in 1, P, O, C, H new.
- Contains E and no A, so invalid.

Next try “EATEN”:
- E in 1 and 5 (invalid).

Next try “EAGLE”:
- E in 1 and 5 (invalid).

Next try “EATLY”:
- E in 1, A in 2, T, L, Y new.
- Contains A and E, no R, I, S.
- E is not in 5, A is not in 1.
This seems valid.

Between “EATON” and “EATLY”, “EATON” has more common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)

From the feedback so far:

1. ARISE → A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - R, I, S are not in the word.

2. EATON → E(-) A(✓) T(x) O(x) N(x)
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T, O, N are not in the word.

3. CABLE → C(x) A(✓) B(x) L(x) E(-)
   - A is still confirmed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (already knew that) and not in position 1 (now confirmed).
   - C, B, L are not in the word.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _
Letters we know are in the word: A (position 2), E (somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5).
Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, I, S, T, O, N, C, B, L.

Remaining common letters to try: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 3, 4, or 5.
- No forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- D A E _ _ → DAVEY, DAVEE (invalid)
- F A E _ _ → FAE_ (no common 5-letter words)
- G A E _ _ → G A E _ (none)
- H A E _ _ → H A E _ (none)
- M A E _ _ → M A E _ (none)
- P A E _ _ → P A E _ (none)
- D _ A E _ → D _ A E (none)
- _ A D E _ → _ A D E (none)
- _ A _ A E → but A is already in position 2
- _ A _ _ E → E in position 5.

Let's try E in position 5: _ A _ _ E
Letters left: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Possible words:
- D A M P E → DAMPE (not a word)
- D A P H E → DAPHE (not a word)
- D A V E E → DAVEE (not a word)
- F A U G E → FAUGE (not a word)
- G A U E _ → G A U E (none)
- H A M E _ → HAMEE (none)
- M A D E Y → MADEY (not common)
- P A D E Y → P A D E Y (none)
- D A M E Y → DAMEY (none)

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe E is in position 3 or 4.

Pattern: _ A E _ _
Letters left: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Possible words:
- D A E _ _ → D A E _ (none)
- F A E _ _ → F A E _ (none)
- G A E _ _ → G A E _ (none)
- H A E _ _ → H A E _ (none)
- K A E _ _ → K A E _ (none)
- M A E _ _ → M A E _ (none)
- P A E _ _ → P A E _ (none)
- U A E _ _ → U A E _ (none)
- V A E _ _ → V A E _ (none)
- W A E _ _ → W A E _ (none)
- Y A E _ _ → Y A E _ (none)

Pattern: _ A _ E _
Letters left: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Possible words:
- D A _ E _ → D A _ E (none)
- F A _ E _ → F A _ E (none)
- G A _ E _ → G A _ E (none)
- H A _ E _ → H A _ E (none)
- K A _ E _ → K A _ E (none)
- M A _ E _ → M A _ E (none)
- P A _ E _ → P A _ E (none)
- U A _ E _ → U A _ E (none)
- V A _ E _ → V A _ E (none)
- W A _ E _ → W A _ E (none)
- Y A _ E _ → Y A _ E (none)

Hmm, let's list actual common words fitting _ A _ _ E with allowed letters:
- D A M P E → DAMPE (not a word)
- F A U G E → FAUGE (not a word)
- G A U G E → GAUGE (G, A, U, G, E)
   - Letters: G, A, U, G, E
   - A is in position 2 (✓)
   - E is in position 5 (allowed)
   - No forbidden letters (R, I, S, T, O, N, C, B, L)
   - GAUGE is a valid word.

Let's check:
- G (new), A (correct position), U (new), G (new), E (in word, position 5 allowed)
- No banned letters.

GAUGE seems to fit all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these. 

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 5).
- R, I, S are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and E, but not R, I, S.
- A is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Does not contain R, I, S.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Good candidate letters to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, U, O, Y, etc.

Let’s try “PLATE”:
- P, L, T are new letters.
- A is in position 3 (not 1).
- E is in position 5 (but feedback said E is not in position 5, so this is bad).

Next try “ELATE”:
- E in position 1 (new position).
- L, A, T are new letters.
- A in position 2 (new position).
- E in position 5 (still bad).

Next try “TALON”:
- T, O, N are new letters.
- A in position 2 (new position).
- L in position 3 (new).
- O in position 4 (new).
- N in position 5 (new).
But we know E must be present, so this is invalid.

Next try “EATON”:
- E in position 1 (new).
- A in position 2 (new).
- T, O, N are new.
- Contains both A and E, no R, I, S.
- E is not in position 5, A is not in position 1.
This seems valid.

Another option is “ELOPE”:
- E in position 1 and 5 (but E can’t be in 5).
So invalid.

Next try “EPOCH”:
- E in 1, P, O, C, H new.
- Contains E and no A, so invalid.

Next try “EATEN”:
- E in 1 and 5 (invalid).

Next try “EAGLE”:
- E in 1 and 5 (invalid).

Next try “EATLY”:
- E in 1, A in 2, T, L, Y new.
- Contains A and E, no R, I, S.
- E is not in 5, A is not in 1.
This seems valid.

Between “EATON” and “EATLY”, “EATON” has more common letters.

Let’s go with “EATON”.

Guess 2: EATON -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) T(x) O(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on EATON:
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1).
- A is in the correct position (position 2).
- T, O, N are not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ A _ _ _
- It contains E, but E is not in position 1.
- It does not contain R, I, S, T, O, N.

Letters we have used and eliminated: R, I, S, T, O, N.
Letters we have confirmed: A (position 2), E (somewhere else).

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A fixed in position 2.
- E somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- No R, I, S, T, O, N.

Possible candidates:
- CABLE: C, A, B, L, E – A is correct, E is in position 5 (allowed), no banned letters.
- MABLE: M, A, B, L, E – same as above.
- PABLE: P, A, B, L, E – same.
- DABLE: D, A, B, L, E – same.

CABLE seems like the most common word among these.

Check:
- CABLE: C (new), A (correct), B (new), L (new), E (in word, position 5 not banned).
- No banned letters (R, I, S, T, O, N) present.

From the feedback so far:

1. ARISE → A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - R, I, S are not in the word.

2. EATON → E(-) A(✓) T(x) O(x) N(x)
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T, O, N are not in the word.

3. CABLE → C(x) A(✓) B(x) L(x) E(-)
   - A is still confirmed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (already knew that) and not in position 1 (now confirmed).
   - C, B, L are not in the word.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _
Letters we know are in the word: A (position 2), E (somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5).
Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, I, S, T, O, N, C, B, L.

Remaining common letters to try: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 3, 4, or 5.
- No forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- D A E _ _ → DAVEY, DAVEE (invalid)
- F A E _ _ → FAE_ (no common 5-letter words)
- G A E _ _ → G A E _ (none)
- H A E _ _ → H A E _ (none)

- P A E _ _ → P A E _ (none)
- D _ A E _ → D _ A E (none)
- _ A D E _ → _ A D E (none)
- _ A _ A E → but A is already in position 2
- _ A _ _ E → E in position 5.

Let's try E in position 5: _ A _ _ E
Letters left: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Possible words:
- D A M P E → DAMPE (not a word)
- D A P H E → DAPHE (not a word)
- D A V E E → DAVEE (not a word)
- F A U G E → FAUGE (not a word)

- H A M E _ → HAMEE (none)
- M A D E Y → MADEY (not common)
- P A D E Y → P A D E Y (none)
- D A M E Y → DAMEY (none)

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe E is in position 3 or 4.

Pattern: _ A E _ _
Letters left: D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Possible words:
- D A E _ _ → D A E _ (none)

Possible words:
- D A _ E _ → D A _ E (none)
- F A _ E _ → F A _ E (none)

- V A _ E _ → V A _ E (none)
- W A _ E _ → W A _ E (none)
- Y A _ E _ → Y A _ E (none)

Hmm, let's list actual common words fitting _ A _ _ E with allowed letters:
- D A M P E → DAMPE (not a word)
- F A U G E → FAUGE (not a word)
- G A U G E → GAUGE (G, A, U, G, E)
   - Letters: G, A, U, G, E
   - A is in position 2 (✓)
   - E is in position 5 (allowed)
   - No forbidden letters (R, I, S, T, O, N, C, B, L)
   - GAUGE is a valid word.

Let's check:
- G (new), A (correct position), U (new), G (new), E (in word, position 5 allowed)
- No banned letters.

GAUGE seems to fit all constraints.

Letters we know are in the word: A (position 2), E (somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5).
Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, I, S, T, O, N, C, B, L, G, U.

Remaining common letters to try: D, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- E in position 3, 4, or 5.
- No forbidden letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ A E _ _  (E in position 3)
- _ A _ E _  (E in position 4)
- _ A _ _ E  (E in position 5)

Let's explore each:

1. _ A E _ _

   - V A _ _ E → V A _ _ E (none)
   - W A _ _ E → W A _ _ E (none)
   - Y A _ _ E → Y A _ _ E (none)

Wait, let's think of actual words that fit these patterns with allowed letters.

Looking at _ A _ _ E:
- D A M P E → DAMPE (not a word)
- D A V E E → DAVEE (not a word)
- F A U G E → FAUGE (not a word)
- H A M E Y → HAMEY (not a word)

- Y A M E D → YAMED (not a word)

Looking at _ A _ E _:
- D A M E Y → DAMEY (not a word)
- F A M E D → FAMED (F, A, M, E, D)
   - Letters: F, A, M, E, D
   - A in position 2 (✓)
   - E in position 4 (allowed)
   - No forbidden letters (R, I, S, T, O, N, C, B, L, G, U)
   - FAMED is a valid word.

Let's check FAMED:
- F (new), A (position 2), M (new), E (position 4), D (new)

From the latest feedback on FAMED:

F(x) A(✓) M(x) E(✓) D(✓)

This tells us:
- A is correctly in position 2.
- E is correctly in position 4.
- D is correctly in position 5.
- F and M are not in the word.

So the pattern is now: _ A _ E D

Letters already ruled out include: R, I, S, T, O, N, C, B, L, G, U, F, M.

Remaining common letters to try: D, H, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Has E in position 4
- Has D in position 5
- Uses only letters not yet excluded.

Possible first letters (position 1) from remaining: D, H, K, P, V, W, Y
Possible third letter (position 3) from remaining: D, H, K, P, V, W, Y

Looking for real words that fit _ A _ E D:

- H A D E D → HADED (not a word)
- H A P E D → HAPED (not a word)
- P A D E D → P A D E D (P A D E D is valid, meaning ""to pad"")
- V A P E D → VAPED (not a word)
- W A P E D → WAPED (not a word)
- Y A P E D → YAPED (not a word)
- D A D E D → D A D E D (valid, past tense of ""dad"")
- D A P E D → D A P E D (valid, past tense of ""daped"" - archaic but valid)

The most common word seems to be ""P A D E D"".

Let's verify:
- P (new), A (position 2), D (position 3), E (position 4), D (position 5)
- All letters are allowed (not in the excluded list)
- It's a valid English word.
