For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants. This should give me good feedback about which letters are present in the word and their positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, and E.
- It does NOT contain A or R.
- O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that uses O, S, E, and two other letters that are not A or R. Also, we must avoid placing O in position 3, S in position 4, and E in position 5.

Possible candidates:
- SOUSE (but has two S’s and two U’s, which might be risky)
- SOLEM (but L is new and M is new)
- STOLE (but T is new and L is new)
- SPOKE (but P is new and K is new)

I’ll choose STOLE because:
- It uses S, T, O, L, E.
- It introduces T and L (common letters not yet tested).
- It places O in position 3, but we know O is not in position 3 from the feedback, so this is invalid.
Oops, can’t use STOLE because O is in position 3, which was marked as wrong position.

Next option: SPOKE
- S, P, O, K, E
- P and K are new letters.
- O is in position 3 (invalid, same reason).

Next: SOLEM
- S, O, L, E, M
- O is in position 2 (valid, since only position 3 was invalid for O).
- L and M are new letters.

This seems good: it keeps S, O, E, adds L and M, and avoids the forbidden positions.

</think>

<guess>OLEMS</guess> (but OLEM S is not a valid word)
Wait, ""OLEMS"" is not a valid English word. Let me rephrase.

Valid word: SOLEM (S-O-L-E-M)
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S was in position 4 and marked as wrong position).
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since O was in position 3 and marked as wrong position).
- L is new.
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since E was in position 5 and marked as wrong position).
- M is new.

So the correct guess is:

<guess>SOLEMS</guess> is invalid. The valid word is SOLEM.

But SOLEM is 5 letters: S-O-L-E-M.

So the guess is:

<guess>SOLEMS</guess> is invalid, the correct word is SOLEM.

- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, and E.
- It does NOT contain A or R.
- O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that uses O, S, E, and two other letters that are not A or R. Also, we must avoid placing O in position 3, S in position 4, and E in position 5.

Possible candidates:
- SOUSE (but has two S’s and two U’s, which might be risky)
- SOLEM (but L is new and M is new)
- STOLE (but T is new and L is new)
- SPOKE (but P is new and K is new)

I’ll choose STOLE because:
- It uses S, T, O, L, E.
- It introduces T and L (common letters not yet tested).
- It places O in position 3, but we know O is not in position 3 from the feedback, so this is invalid.
Oops, can’t use STOLE because O is in position 3, which was marked as wrong position.

Next option: SPOKE
- S, P, O, K, E
- P and K are new letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants. This should give me good feedback about which letters are present in the word and their positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

From the new feedback on OLEMS:

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 1.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 3.
- M(x) – M is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5 (correct).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S (position 5), O, E.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, L, M.
- O cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- E cannot be in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing O and E, with O not in positions 1 or 3, and E not in position 3.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, R, L, M).

We need two more distinct letters from the remaining pool. Let's try to keep it simple.

Looking for words ending in S with O and E:
- O must be in position 2 or 4 (since 1 and 3 are excluded).
- E must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is S), so 1, 2, or 4.

Possible patterns:
- E _ O _ S (E in 1, O in 3 – but O can't be in 3)
- _ E O _ S (E in 2, O in 3 – but O can't be in 3)
- _ _ O E S (O in 3 – invalid)
- E _ _ O S (E in 1, O in 4)
- _ E _ O S (E in 2, O in 4)
- _ _ E O S (E in 3 – invalid)

So valid patterns:
- E _ _ O S (E in 1, O in 4)
- _ E _ O S (E in 2, O in 4)

Let's try E _ _ O S:
Need two letters in positions 2 and 3, not A, R, L, M.
Possible: E N D O S (but D is new, N is new)
But ""ENDOS"" is not a valid word.

Next: _ E _ O S:
Need letters for positions 1 and 3.
Possible: T E N O S (but N is new, T is new) – ""TENOS"" is not a valid word.
Another: C H E O S – ""CHEOS"" is not valid.
Another: P E N O S – ""PENOS"" is not valid.
Another: D E B O S – ""DEBOS"" is not valid.
Another: B E D O S – ""BEDOS"" is not valid.
Another: F E N O S – ""FENOS"" is not valid.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe O is in position 2:
Pattern: _ O _ _ S
But E must be in 1, 4, or 5 (5 is S), so:
E O _ _ S (E in 1, O in 2)
_ O E _ S (O in 2, E in 3 – but E can't be in 3)
_ O _ E S (E in 4)

So:
E O _ _ S – need two letters for 3 and 4, not A, R, L, M.
Possible: E O N T S – ""EONTS"" is not valid.
E O N D S – ""EONDS"" is not valid.
E O N G S – ""EONGS"" is not valid.
E O N K S – ""EONKS"" is not valid.
E O N P S – ""EONPS"" is not valid.
E O N V S – ""EONVS"" is not valid.
E O N W S – ""EONWS"" is not valid.
E O N Y S – ""EONY S"" is not valid.

_ O _ E S – need letters for 1 and 3.
Possible: T O N E S – ""TONES"" is a valid word.
Check constraints:
- Ends in S (position 5) – ✓
- Contains O and E – ✓
- O is in position 2 – allowed (not 1 or 3) – ✓
- E is in position 4 – allowed (not 3) – ✓
- Letters used: T, O, N, E, S – none of A, R, L, M – ✓

This seems perfect.

- O cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- E cannot be in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing O and E, with O not in positions 1 or 3, and E not in position 3.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, R, L, M).

We need two more distinct letters from the remaining pool. Let's try to keep it simple.

Looking for words ending in S with O and E:
- O must be in position 2 or 4 (since 1 and 3 are excluded).
- E must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is S), so 1, 2, or 4.

Possible patterns:
- E _ O _ S (E in 1, O in 3 – but O can't be in 3)
- _ E O _ S (E in 2, O in 3 – but O can't be in 3)
- _ _ O E S (O in 3 – invalid)
- E _ _ O S (E in 1, O in 4)
- _ E _ O S (E in 2, O in 4)
- _ _ E O S (E in 3 – invalid)

So valid patterns:
- E _ _ O S (E in 1, O in 4)
- _ E _ O S (E in 2, O in 4)

Let's try E _ _ O S:
Need two letters in positions 2 and 3, not A, R, L, M.
Possible: E N D O S (but D is new, N is new)
But ""ENDOS"" is not a valid word.

Next: _ E _ O S:
Need letters for positions 1 and 3.
Possible: T E N O S (but N is new, T is new) – ""TENOS"" is not a valid word.
Another: C H E O S – ""CHEOS"" is not valid.
Another: P E N O S – ""PENOS"" is not valid.
Another: D E B O S – ""DEBOS"" is not valid.
Another: B E D O S – ""BEDOS"" is not valid.
Another: F E N O S – ""FENOS"" is not valid.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe O is in position 2:
Pattern: _ O _ _ S
But E must be in 1, 4, or 5 (5 is S), so:
E O _ _ S (E in 1, O in 2)
_ O E _ S (O in 2, E in 3 – but E can't be in 3)
_ O _ E S (E in 4)

So:
E O _ _ S – need two letters for 3 and 4, not A, R, L, M.
Possible: E O N T S – ""EONTS"" is not valid.
E O N D S – ""EONDS"" is not valid.
E O N G S – ""EONGS"" is not valid.
E O N K S – ""EONKS"" is not valid.
E O N P S – ""EONPS"" is not valid.
E O N V S – ""EONVS"" is not valid.
E O N W S – ""EONWS"" is not valid.
E O N Y S – ""EONY S"" is not valid.

_ O _ E S – need letters for 1 and 3.
Possible: T O N E S – ""TONES"" is a valid word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants. This should give me good feedback about which letters are present in the word and their positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, and E.
- It does NOT contain A or R.
- O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that uses O, S, E, and two other letters that are not A or R. Also, we must avoid placing O in position 3, S in position 4, and E in position 5.

Possible candidates:
- SOUSE (but has two S’s and two U’s, which might be risky)
- SOLEM (but L is new and M is new)
- STOLE (but T is new and L is new)
- SPOKE (but P is new and K is new)

I’ll choose STOLE because:
- It uses S, T, O, L, E.
- It introduces T and L (common letters not yet tested).
- It places O in position 3, but we know O is not in position 3 from the feedback, so this is invalid.
Oops, can’t use STOLE because O is in position 3, which was marked as wrong position.

Next option: SPOKE
- S, P, O, K, E
- P and K are new letters.
- O is in position 3 (invalid, same reason).

Next: SOLEM
- S, O, L, E, M
- O is in position 2 (valid, since only position 3 was invalid for O).
- L and M are new letters.

This seems good: it keeps S, O, E, adds L and M, and avoids the forbidden positions.

From the new feedback on OLEMS:

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 1.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 3.
- M(x) – M is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5 (correct).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S (position 5), O, E.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, L, M.
- O cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- E cannot be in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing O and E, with O not in positions 1 or 3, and E not in position 3.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, R, L, M).

We need two more distinct letters from the remaining pool. Let's try to keep it simple.

Looking for words ending in S with O and E:
- O must be in position 2 or 4 (since 1 and 3 are excluded).
- E must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is S), so 1, 2, or 4.

Possible patterns:
- E _ O _ S (E in 1, O in 3 – but O can't be in 3)
- _ E O _ S (E in 2, O in 3 – but O can't be in 3)
- _ _ O E S (O in 3 – invalid)
- E _ _ O S (E in 1, O in 4)
- _ E _ O S (E in 2, O in 4)
- _ _ E O S (E in 3 – invalid)

So valid patterns:
- E _ _ O S (E in 1, O in 4)
- _ E _ O S (E in 2, O in 4)

Let's try E _ _ O S:
Need two letters in positions 2 and 3, not A, R, L, M.
Possible: E N D O S (but D is new, N is new)
But ""ENDOS"" is not a valid word.

Next: _ E _ O S:
Need letters for positions 1 and 3.
Possible: T E N O S (but N is new, T is new) – ""TENOS"" is not a valid word.
Another: C H E O S – ""CHEOS"" is not valid.
Another: P E N O S – ""PENOS"" is not valid.
Another: D E B O S – ""DEBOS"" is not valid.
Another: B E D O S – ""BEDOS"" is not valid.
Another: F E N O S – ""FENOS"" is not valid.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe O is in position 2:
Pattern: _ O _ _ S
But E must be in 1, 4, or 5 (5 is S), so:
E O _ _ S (E in 1, O in 2)
_ O E _ S (O in 2, E in 3 – but E can't be in 3)
_ O _ E S (E in 4)

So:
E O _ _ S – need two letters for 3 and 4, not A, R, L, M.
Possible: E O N T S – ""EONTS"" is not valid.
E O N D S – ""EONDS"" is not valid.
E O N G S – ""EONGS"" is not valid.
E O N K S – ""EONKS"" is not valid.
E O N P S – ""EONPS"" is not valid.
E O N V S – ""EONVS"" is not valid.
E O N W S – ""EONWS"" is not valid.
E O N Y S – ""EONY S"" is not valid.

_ O _ E S – need letters for 1 and 3.
Possible: T O N E S – ""TONES"" is a valid word.
Check constraints:
- Ends in S (position 5) – ✓
- Contains O and E – ✓
- O is in position 2 – allowed (not 1 or 3) – ✓
- E is in position 4 – allowed (not 3) – ✓
- Letters used: T, O, N, E, S – none of A, R, L, M – ✓

This seems perfect.

From Guess 3 (TONES) we now have:

T(x)  – T is NOT in the word  
O(✓)  – O is in the word and in position 2  
N(✓)  – N is in the word and in position 3  
E(✓)  – E is in the word and in position 4  
S(✓)  – S is in the word and in position 5  

So the word pattern is now fully determined:

_  O  N  E  S

All that remains is to find the single missing first letter.  
We already know the letters NOT in the word: A, R, L, M, T.  
We need a 5-letter English word that fits the pattern ?ONES.

Possible first letters (common consonants not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid English words:
- BONES  
- CONES (plural of cone, but less common)  
- GONES (rare)  
- HONES (rare)  
- JONES  
- KONES (not a word)  
- PONES (not a word)  
- WONES (not a word)  
- YONES (not a word)  

The most common and likely word is BONES.
