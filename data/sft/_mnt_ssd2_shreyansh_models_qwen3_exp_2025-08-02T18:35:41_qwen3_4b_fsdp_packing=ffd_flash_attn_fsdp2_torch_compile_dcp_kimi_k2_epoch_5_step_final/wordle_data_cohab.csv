For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should include several of these to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

After considering various options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and provides good coverage of vowels and consonants. This will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses based on the feedback received.

Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

   - F, U, S are not in the word.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Must contain: A (not in 1 or 3), C (not in 3)
- Must NOT contain: R, S, E, T, D, Y, F, U

Available letters (common ones left): B, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, X, Z, plus A and C.

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Has A in position 4 or 5.
- Has C somewhere else (not position 3).
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let's try to place A in position 4:
_ O _ A _

Now we need to place C in position 1 or 5 (since position 3 is excluded for C).
- If C in position 1: C O _ A _ → need a letter for position 3 and 5. Possible letters: B, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, X, Z.
  - C O B A N → ""COBAN"" (valid word)
  - C O G A N → ""COGAN"" (valid)
  - C O M A N → ""COMAN"" (valid)
  - C O P A N → ""COPAN"" (valid)
  - C O V A N → ""COVAN"" (valid)
  - C O W A N → ""COWAN"" (valid)

Let's pick ""COMAN"" (though it's less common, it's valid).

But let's see if we can find a more common word. Another option is to place A in position 5:
_ O _ _ A

Now C must be in position 1 or 4 (not 3):
- C O _ _ A → need letters for 3 and 4.
  - C O M P A → ""COMPA"" (not a word)
  - C O N T A → invalid (T excluded)
  - C O G N A → ""COGNA"" (not a word)

  - M O C K A → ""MOCKA"" (valid, a type of coffee)
  - P O C K A → ""POCKA"" (not a word)
  - V O C K A → ""VOCKA"" (not a word)

""MOCKA"" seems like the best option here.

But let's check if there's a simpler word. Another candidate is ""BOCCA"" (Italian for mouth, but may not be in Wordle list). 

Another approach: let's try ""COBIA"" (a fish), but it's not 5 letters.

Wait, let's list possible words:
- COBAN
- COGAS (invalid, S excluded)
- COMAS (invalid, S excluded)
- COPAS (invalid, S excluded)
- COVAN

""MOCKA"" seems the most plausible common word.

But let me think of another word with A in position 4:
_ O _ A _

C must be in position 1 or 5:
- C O _ A _ → need letters for 3 and 5.
  - C O M A N → ""COMAN"" (valid)
  - C O P A N → ""COPAN"" (valid)
  - C O B A N → ""COBAN"" (valid)

""COMAN"" is valid.

Between ""COMAN"" and ""MOCKA"", ""COMAN"" is more straightforward.

But let me check if there's a better word. Another candidate is ""COBIA"" but it's 5 letters? No, COBIA is 5 letters (C-O-B-I-A), but it's a fish.

But we have constraints:
- Must contain C (not in 3)
- Must contain A (not in 1 or 3)
- O in 2
- No R,S,E,T,D,Y,F,U

""COBIA"" would be:
C O B I A
- C in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- B in position 3 (allowed)
- I in position 4 (allowed)
- A in position 5 (allowed)
- Contains all required letters and no forbidden ones.

This seems perfect.

So the next guess should be ""COBIA"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should include several of these to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

After considering various options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and provides good coverage of vowels and consonants. This will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses based on the feedback received.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, S, E.
- Letters present: A, O (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively).

We need a word that:
1. Contains both A and O.
2. Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than 1st.
4. Places O somewhere other than 3rd.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses common letters is ""TOADY"":
- T (new consonant)
- O (in word, not in 3rd position)
- A (in word, not in 1st position)
- D (new consonant)
- Y (new consonant)

This uses A and O in new positions and introduces new common letters T, D, Y.

   - Letters known NOT in the word: R, S, E

2. toady → T(x) O(✓) A(-) D(x) Y(x)
   - O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2)
   - A is in the word but not in position 3
   - Letters NOT in the word: T, D, Y

Current constraints:
- Word must be 5 letters.
- Must contain O in position 2.
- Must contain A but not in position 1 or 3.
- Must NOT contain: R, S, E, T, D, Y.

Possible positions for A:
- Position 2: already O, so impossible.
- Position 4 or 5.

Possible letters left (common ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a word with:
- O in position 2.
- A in position 4 or 5.
- Other letters from the remaining pool.

Let's try to find a word with A in position 4 and O in position 2:
_ O _ A _

Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 5: from remaining consonants and vowels.

A good candidate is ""FOCAL"":
- F (new consonant)
- O (correct position 2)
- C (new consonant)
- A (in position 4, which is allowed)

Let's digest the new feedback from COBIA:

C(✓)  → C is correct in position 1  
O(✓)  → O is correct in position 2  
B(-)  → B is in the word but not in position 3  
I(x)  → I is NOT in the word  
A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 5  

Current constraints:
- Pattern: C O _ _ _
- Must contain: B (not in position 3), A (not in position 1, 3, or 5)
- Must NOT contain: R, S, E, T, D, Y, F, U, I

Positions left to fill: 3, 4, 5  
A must appear in position 4 (only remaining spot not excluded).  
B must appear in position 5 (only remaining spot not excluded).  

So the word must be: C O _ A B  
The missing letter in position 3 must be from the allowed set: B, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, X, Z  
(But B is already used in position 5, so position 3 can be any of the remaining consonants.)

Looking for common 5-letter words matching C O _ A B:
- COGAB (invalid, not a word)
- COMAB (invalid)
- CONAB (invalid)
- COPAB (invalid)
- COGAB (invalid)
- COHAB (valid word, short for ""cohabit"")

""COHAB"" is a valid English word meaning ""to cohabit"" or ""to live together"".

Let's verify:
C O H A B
- C(✓) position 1
- O(✓) position 2
- H (new, allowed)
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- B in position 5 (allowed)
No forbidden letters used.

This should be the correct word.
