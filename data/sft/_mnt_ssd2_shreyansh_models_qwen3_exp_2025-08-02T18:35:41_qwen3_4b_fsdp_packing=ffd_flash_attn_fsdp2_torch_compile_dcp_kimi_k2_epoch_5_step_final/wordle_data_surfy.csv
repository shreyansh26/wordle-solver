For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc.)
2. Include multiple vowels to test their presence
3. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters

Popular strong starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and S.
- R is not in position 2.
- S is not in position 4.
- The word does NOT contain A, O, or E.

We need a new word that:
1. Includes both R and S.
2. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4.
4. Uses none of A, O, E.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowel options left: I, U.

Possible candidates:
- TRUST (but has U and T, S is in position 4 which is invalid)
- STIRP (but P is less common)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P - R in 2 is invalid)
- BRISK (B, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid)
- DRIPS (D, R, I, P, S - R in 2 invalid)
- TRICK (but no S)
- STIRK (S, T, I, R, K - R in 4 invalid)
- TRISK (T, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid)

Looking at these, ""TRUST"" is invalid because S is in position 4. ""CRISP"" is invalid because R is in position 2. ""BRISK"" is invalid because R is in position 2. ""STIRK"" is invalid because R is in position 4.

Next option: ""STIRP"" - but P is less common. ""DRIPS"" - R is in position 2 invalid. ""TRICK"" - no S.

Another approach: place R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and S in positions 1,2,3,5.

Possible words:
- FIRST (but no S)
- GRIST (G, R, I, S, T - R in 2 invalid)
- FRISK (F, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid)
- GRIPS (G, R, I, P, S - R in 2 invalid)

""GRIST"" has R in position 2 - invalid.

""TRIPS"" - R in 2 invalid.

""STIRP"" - R in 4, S in 1 - acceptable.

""STIRP"" seems valid:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- T, I, R, P - but R is in position 4 (allowed)
- No A, O, E
- Contains R and S

But ""STIRP"" might not be as common as other words.

Alternative: ""CRISP"" - but R in 2 invalid.

""BRISK"" - R in 2 invalid.

""DRIPS"" - R in 2 invalid.

""TRISK"" - R in 2 invalid.

""STIRK"" - R in 4, S in 1 - acceptable.

""STIRK"" is valid:
- S in 1
- T, I, R, K
- R in 4 (allowed)
- No A, O, E
- Contains R and S

Between ""STIRP"" and ""STIRK"", ""STIRK"" seems slightly more common.

Another candidate: ""CRISP"" invalid R position.

""PRISK"" - P, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid.

""BRISK"" - R in 2 invalid.

""FRISK"" - R in 2 invalid.

""TRISK"" seems the best so far.

But let's think differently: maybe R in position 3.

Possible word: ""CRUST"" - but U is allowed (vowels left: I, U)
- C, R, U, S, T
- R in 3 (allowed)
- S in 4 - but S is not allowed in position 4 (from feedback S(-) means S not in 4)
So ""CRUST"" invalid because S is in 4.

""FRUIT"" - but no S.

""GRUNT"" - no S.

""TRUNK"" - no S.

""TRUST"" - S in 4 invalid.

""CRUST"" - S in 4 invalid.

""BRUNT"" - no S.

""PRUNE"" - no S.

""DRUNK"" - no S.

""CRISP"" - S in 4 invalid.

""FRISK"" - S in 4 invalid.

""BRISK"" - S in 4 invalid.

""TRISK"" - S in 1, R in 4 - acceptable.

""STIRK"" - same as TRISK.

""STIRK"" seems the only valid word fitting constraints.

But let me check ""STIRK"":
- S T I R K
- R is in position 4 (allowed, since feedback only said R not in 2)
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since feedback said S not in 4)
- No A, O, E
- Contains R and S

This seems correct.

Another candidate: ""CRISP"" invalid.

""BRISK"" invalid.

""GRIST"" invalid.

""TRISK"" seems the best.

But let me think of another word: ""CRISP"" invalid R position.

""STIRK"" seems the only valid word fitting the constraints.

However, ""STIRK"" might be obscure.

Alternative: ""CRISP"" invalid.

""FRISK"" invalid.

""DRISK"" - D, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid.

""GRISK"" - G, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid.

""PRISK"" - P, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid.

""TRISK"" seems the only valid word.

But let me think of ""STIRP"" - S, T, I, R, P - R in 4 (allowed), S in 1 (allowed), no A, O, E.

""STIRP"" is also valid.

Between ""STIRP"" and ""STIRK"", ""STIRP"" might be slightly more common.

Another candidate: ""STIRP"".

Thus, I'll choose ""STIRP"".

But wait, let me verify:
- S T I R P
- R in 4 (allowed)
- S in 1 (allowed)
- No A, O, E
- Contains R and S

Yes, ""STIRP"" is valid.

But ""STIRK"" is also valid.

I'll go with ""STIRK"" as it's slightly more common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc.)
2. Include multiple vowels to test their presence
3. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters

Popular strong starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and S.
- R is not in position 2.
- S is not in position 4.
- The word does NOT contain A, O, or E.

We need a new word that:
1. Includes both R and S.
2. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4.
4. Uses none of A, O, E.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowel options left: I, U.

Possible candidates:
- TRUST (but has U and T, S is in position 4 which is invalid)
- STIRP (but P is less common)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P - R in 2 is invalid)
- BRISK (B, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid)
- DRIPS (D, R, I, P, S - R in 2 invalid)
- TRICK (but no S)
- STIRK (S, T, I, R, K - R in 4 invalid)
- TRISK (T, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid)

Looking at these, ""TRUST"" is invalid because S is in position 4. ""CRISP"" is invalid because R is in position 2. ""BRISK"" is invalid because R is in position 2. ""STIRK"" is invalid because R is in position 4.

Next option: ""STIRP"" - but P is less common. ""DRIPS"" - R is in position 2 invalid. ""TRICK"" - no S.

Another approach: place R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and S in positions 1,2,3,5.

Possible words:
- FIRST (but no S)
- GRIST (G, R, I, S, T - R in 2 invalid)
- FRISK (F, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid)
- GRIPS (G, R, I, P, S - R in 2 invalid)

""GRIST"" has R in position 2 - invalid.

""TRIPS"" - R in 2 invalid.

""STIRP"" - R in 4, S in 1 - acceptable.

""STIRP"" seems valid:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- T, I, R, P - but R is in position 4 (allowed)
- No A, O, E
- Contains R and S

But ""STIRP"" might not be as common as other words.

Alternative: ""CRISP"" - but R in 2 invalid.

""BRISK"" - R in 2 invalid.

""DRIPS"" - R in 2 invalid.

""TRISK"" - R in 2 invalid.

""STIRK"" - R in 4, S in 1 - acceptable.

""STIRK"" is valid:
- S in 1
- T, I, R, K
- R in 4 (allowed)
- No A, O, E
- Contains R and S

Between ""STIRP"" and ""STIRK"", ""STIRK"" seems slightly more common.

Another candidate: ""CRISP"" invalid R position.

""PRISK"" - P, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid.

""BRISK"" - R in 2 invalid.

""FRISK"" - R in 2 invalid.

""TRISK"" seems the best so far.

But let's think differently: maybe R in position 3.

Possible word: ""CRUST"" - but U is allowed (vowels left: I, U)
- C, R, U, S, T
- R in 3 (allowed)
- S in 4 - but S is not allowed in position 4 (from feedback S(-) means S not in 4)
So ""CRUST"" invalid because S is in 4.

""FRUIT"" - but no S.

""GRUNT"" - no S.

""TRUNK"" - no S.

""TRUST"" - S in 4 invalid.

""CRUST"" - S in 4 invalid.

""BRUNT"" - no S.

""PRUNE"" - no S.

""DRUNK"" - no S.

""CRISP"" - S in 4 invalid.

""FRISK"" - S in 4 invalid.

""BRISK"" - S in 4 invalid.

""TRISK"" - S in 1, R in 4 - acceptable.

""STIRK"" - same as TRISK.

""STIRK"" seems the only valid word fitting constraints.

But let me check ""STIRK"":
- S T I R K
- R is in position 4 (allowed, since feedback only said R not in 2)
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since feedback said S not in 4)
- No A, O, E
- Contains R and S

This seems correct.

Another candidate: ""CRISP"" invalid.

""BRISK"" invalid.

""GRIST"" invalid.

""TRISK"" seems the best.

But let me think of another word: ""CRISP"" invalid R position.

""STIRK"" seems the only valid word fitting the constraints.

However, ""STIRK"" might be obscure.

Alternative: ""CRISP"" invalid.

""FRISK"" invalid.

""DRISK"" - D, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid.

""GRISK"" - G, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid.

""PRISK"" - P, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid.

""TRISK"" seems the only valid word.

But let me think of ""STIRP"" - S, T, I, R, P - R in 4 (allowed), S in 1 (allowed), no A, O, E.

""STIRP"" is also valid.

Between ""STIRP"" and ""STIRK"", ""STIRP"" might be slightly more common.

Another candidate: ""STIRP"".

Thus, I'll choose ""STIRP"".

But wait, let me verify:
- S T I R P
- R in 4 (allowed)
- S in 1 (allowed)

- Contains R and S

Yes, ""STIRP"" is valid.

But ""STIRK"" is also valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc.)
2. Include multiple vowels to test their presence
3. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters

Popular strong starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and S.
- R is not in position 2.
- S is not in position 4.
- The word does NOT contain A, O, or E.

We need a new word that:
1. Includes both R and S.
2. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4.
4. Uses none of A, O, E.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowel options left: I, U.

Possible candidates:
- TRUST (but has U and T, S is in position 4 which is invalid)
- STIRP (but P is less common)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P - R in 2 is invalid)
- BRISK (B, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid)
- DRIPS (D, R, I, P, S - R in 2 invalid)
- TRICK (but no S)
- STIRK (S, T, I, R, K - R in 4 invalid)
- TRISK (T, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid)

Looking at these, ""TRUST"" is invalid because S is in position 4. ""CRISP"" is invalid because R is in position 2. ""BRISK"" is invalid because R is in position 2. ""STIRK"" is invalid because R is in position 4.

Next option: ""STIRP"" - but P is less common. ""DRIPS"" - R is in position 2 invalid. ""TRICK"" - no S.

Another approach: place R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and S in positions 1,2,3,5.

Possible words:
- FIRST (but no S)
- GRIST (G, R, I, S, T - R in 2 invalid)
- FRISK (F, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid)
- GRIPS (G, R, I, P, S - R in 2 invalid)

""GRIST"" has R in position 2 - invalid.

""TRIPS"" - R in 2 invalid.

""STIRP"" - R in 4, S in 1 - acceptable.

""STIRP"" seems valid:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- T, I, R, P - but R is in position 4 (allowed)
- No A, O, E
- Contains R and S

But ""STIRP"" might not be as common as other words.

Alternative: ""CRISP"" - but R in 2 invalid.

""BRISK"" - R in 2 invalid.

""DRIPS"" - R in 2 invalid.

""TRISK"" - R in 2 invalid.

""STIRK"" - R in 4, S in 1 - acceptable.

""STIRK"" is valid:
- S in 1
- T, I, R, K
- R in 4 (allowed)
- No A, O, E
- Contains R and S

Between ""STIRP"" and ""STIRK"", ""STIRK"" seems slightly more common.

Another candidate: ""CRISP"" invalid R position.

""PRISK"" - P, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid.

""BRISK"" - R in 2 invalid.

""FRISK"" - R in 2 invalid.

""TRISK"" seems the best so far.

But let's think differently: maybe R in position 3.

Possible word: ""CRUST"" - but U is allowed (vowels left: I, U)
- C, R, U, S, T
- R in 3 (allowed)
- S in 4 - but S is not allowed in position 4 (from feedback S(-) means S not in 4)
So ""CRUST"" invalid because S is in 4.

""FRUIT"" - but no S.

""GRUNT"" - no S.

""TRUNK"" - no S.

""TRUST"" - S in 4 invalid.

""CRUST"" - S in 4 invalid.

""BRUNT"" - no S.

""PRUNE"" - no S.

""DRUNK"" - no S.

""CRISP"" - S in 4 invalid.

""FRISK"" - S in 4 invalid.

""BRISK"" - S in 4 invalid.

""TRISK"" - S in 1, R in 4 - acceptable.

""STIRK"" - same as TRISK.

""STIRK"" seems the only valid word fitting constraints.

But let me check ""STIRK"":
- S T I R K
- R is in position 4 (allowed, since feedback only said R not in 2)
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since feedback said S not in 4)
- No A, O, E
- Contains R and S

This seems correct.

Another candidate: ""CRISP"" invalid.

""BRISK"" invalid.

""GRIST"" invalid.

""TRISK"" seems the best.

But let me think of another word: ""CRISP"" invalid R position.

""STIRK"" seems the only valid word fitting the constraints.

However, ""STIRK"" might be obscure.

Alternative: ""CRISP"" invalid.

""FRISK"" invalid.

""DRISK"" - D, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid.

""GRISK"" - G, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid.

""PRISK"" - P, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid.

""TRISK"" seems the only valid word.

But let me think of ""STIRP"" - S, T, I, R, P - R in 4 (allowed), S in 1 (allowed), no A, O, E.

""STIRP"" is also valid.

Between ""STIRP"" and ""STIRK"", ""STIRP"" might be slightly more common.

Another candidate: ""STIRP"".

Thus, I'll choose ""STIRP"".

But wait, let me verify:
- S T I R P
- R in 4 (allowed)
- S in 1 (allowed)
- No A, O, E
- Contains R and S

Yes, ""STIRP"" is valid.

But ""STIRK"" is also valid.

I'll go with ""STIRK"" as it's slightly more common.

Final decision: ""STIRK"".

- Letters known to be in the word: S (fixed at position 1), R (somewhere else)
- Remaining possible letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains R somewhere other than positions 2, 4.
3. Uses none of A, O, E, T, I, K.

Possible positions for R: 3 or 5 (since 1 is S, 2 and 4 are excluded).

Let’s brainstorm:
- S _ R _ _ (R in 3)
- S _ _ _ R (R in 5)

Common endings with R in 5: “SURER”, “SURER” invalid (E), “SUGAR” (A), “SULUR” (not a word), “SUNDR” (invalid), “SUNRI” (invalid).

R in 3:
- S _ R _ _
  – “SPURN” (P, U, N) – but N is allowed, U allowed, P allowed. This is a valid word.
  – “SWARM” (A) invalid.
  – “SWIRL” (I) invalid.
  – “SMURD” (D) – but D is allowed, but “SMURD” is obscure.
  – “SCRUB” (B) – but B is allowed, C allowed, U allowed, B allowed. “SCRUB” is valid.

Between “SPURN” and “SCRUB”, “SCRUB” is more common.

Check constraints:
- Starts with S – ✓
- Contains R in position 3 – ✓
- No forbidden letters (A, O, E, T, I, K) – ✓
- Uses only allowed letters – ✓

This tells us:
- S is correct in position 1
- U is correct in position 2
- R is correct in position 3
- Y is correct in position 5
- L is not in the word

So the pattern is now locked in as:
S U R _ Y

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc.)
2. Include multiple vowels to test their presence
3. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters

Popular strong starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and S.
- R is not in position 2.
- S is not in position 4.
- The word does NOT contain A, O, or E.

We need a new word that:
1. Includes both R and S.
2. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4.
4. Uses none of A, O, E.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowel options left: I, U.

Possible candidates:
- TRUST (but has U and T, S is in position 4 which is invalid)
- STIRP (but P is less common)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P - R in 2 is invalid)
- BRISK (B, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid)
- DRIPS (D, R, I, P, S - R in 2 invalid)
- TRICK (but no S)
- STIRK (S, T, I, R, K - R in 4 invalid)
- TRISK (T, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid)

Looking at these, ""TRUST"" is invalid because S is in position 4. ""CRISP"" is invalid because R is in position 2. ""BRISK"" is invalid because R is in position 2. ""STIRK"" is invalid because R is in position 4.

Next option: ""STIRP"" - but P is less common. ""DRIPS"" - R is in position 2 invalid. ""TRICK"" - no S.

Another approach: place R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and S in positions 1,2,3,5.

Possible words:
- FIRST (but no S)
- GRIST (G, R, I, S, T - R in 2 invalid)
- FRISK (F, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid)
- GRIPS (G, R, I, P, S - R in 2 invalid)

""GRIST"" has R in position 2 - invalid.

""TRIPS"" - R in 2 invalid.

""STIRP"" - R in 4, S in 1 - acceptable.

""STIRP"" seems valid:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- T, I, R, P - but R is in position 4 (allowed)
- No A, O, E
- Contains R and S

But ""STIRP"" might not be as common as other words.

Alternative: ""CRISP"" - but R in 2 invalid.

""BRISK"" - R in 2 invalid.

""DRIPS"" - R in 2 invalid.

""TRISK"" - R in 2 invalid.

""STIRK"" - R in 4, S in 1 - acceptable.

""STIRK"" is valid:
- S in 1
- T, I, R, K
- R in 4 (allowed)
- No A, O, E
- Contains R and S

Between ""STIRP"" and ""STIRK"", ""STIRK"" seems slightly more common.

Another candidate: ""CRISP"" invalid R position.

""PRISK"" - P, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid.

""BRISK"" - R in 2 invalid.

""FRISK"" - R in 2 invalid.

""TRISK"" seems the best so far.

But let's think differently: maybe R in position 3.

Possible word: ""CRUST"" - but U is allowed (vowels left: I, U)
- C, R, U, S, T
- R in 3 (allowed)
- S in 4 - but S is not allowed in position 4 (from feedback S(-) means S not in 4)
So ""CRUST"" invalid because S is in 4.

""FRUIT"" - but no S.

""GRUNT"" - no S.

""TRUNK"" - no S.

""TRUST"" - S in 4 invalid.

""CRUST"" - S in 4 invalid.

""BRUNT"" - no S.

""PRUNE"" - no S.

""DRUNK"" - no S.

""CRISP"" - S in 4 invalid.

""FRISK"" - S in 4 invalid.

""BRISK"" - S in 4 invalid.

""TRISK"" - S in 1, R in 4 - acceptable.

""STIRK"" - same as TRISK.

""STIRK"" seems the only valid word fitting constraints.

But let me check ""STIRK"":
- S T I R K
- R is in position 4 (allowed, since feedback only said R not in 2)
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since feedback said S not in 4)
- No A, O, E
- Contains R and S

This seems correct.

Another candidate: ""CRISP"" invalid.

""BRISK"" invalid.

""GRIST"" invalid.

""TRISK"" seems the best.

But let me think of another word: ""CRISP"" invalid R position.

""STIRK"" seems the only valid word fitting the constraints.

However, ""STIRK"" might be obscure.

Alternative: ""CRISP"" invalid.

""FRISK"" invalid.

""DRISK"" - D, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid.

""GRISK"" - G, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid.

""PRISK"" - P, R, I, S, K - R in 2 invalid.

""TRISK"" seems the only valid word.

But let me think of ""STIRP"" - S, T, I, R, P - R in 4 (allowed), S in 1 (allowed), no A, O, E.

""STIRP"" is also valid.

Between ""STIRP"" and ""STIRK"", ""STIRP"" might be slightly more common.

Another candidate: ""STIRP"".

Thus, I'll choose ""STIRP"".

But wait, let me verify:
- S T I R P
- R in 4 (allowed)
- S in 1 (allowed)
- No A, O, E
- Contains R and S

Yes, ""STIRP"" is valid.

But ""STIRK"" is also valid.

I'll go with ""STIRK"" as it's slightly more common.

Final decision: ""STIRK"".

From the new feedback on STIRK:
- S(✓) – S is in the word and is in position 1.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 4.
- K(x) – K is not in the word.

Combining with the first feedback:
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, I, K
- Letters known to be in the word: S (fixed at position 1), R (somewhere else)
- Remaining possible letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains R somewhere other than positions 2, 4.
3. Uses none of A, O, E, T, I, K.

Possible positions for R: 3 or 5 (since 1 is S, 2 and 4 are excluded).

Let’s brainstorm:
- S _ R _ _ (R in 3)
- S _ _ _ R (R in 5)

Common endings with R in 5: “SURER”, “SURER” invalid (E), “SUGAR” (A), “SULUR” (not a word), “SUNDR” (invalid), “SUNRI” (invalid).

R in 3:
- S _ R _ _
  – “SPURN” (P, U, N) – but N is allowed, U allowed, P allowed. This is a valid word.
  – “SWARM” (A) invalid.
  – “SWIRL” (I) invalid.
  – “SMURD” (D) – but D is allowed, but “SMURD” is obscure.
  – “SCRUB” (B) – but B is allowed, C allowed, U allowed, B allowed. “SCRUB” is valid.

Between “SPURN” and “SCRUB”, “SCRUB” is more common.

Check constraints:
- Starts with S – ✓
- Contains R in position 3 – ✓
- No forbidden letters (A, O, E, T, I, K) – ✓
- Uses only allowed letters – ✓

Thus, “SCRUB” fits perfectly.

- R(✓) – R is now confirmed in position 3.
- U(-) – U is in the word but not in position 4.
- B(x) – B is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: S _ R _ _
- Must contain U, but U cannot be in position 4 (it can only be in position 2 or 5).
- Forbidden letters: A, O, E, T, I, K, C, B
- Remaining allowed letters (common): D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, plus U.

Possible patterns:
1. S U R _ _ (U in position 2)
2. S _ R _ U (U in position 5)

Let’s explore both.

1. S U R _ _ (U in position 2)
   We need two more letters from the allowed set, not repeating any used.  
   Common endings: “SURER” (E forbidden), “SURGE” (E), “SURLY” (L, Y allowed).  
   “SURLY” is valid and fits all constraints.

2. S _ R _ U (U in position 5)
   We need two letters in positions 2 and 4.  
   Example: “SPRUG” (G allowed) – but “SPRUG” is obscure.  
   “STRUM” (T forbidden).  
   “SNARU” (not a word).  
   “SHRUG” (H, G allowed) – valid word.

From Guess 4 (SURLY) we received:

S(✓) U(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)

This tells us:
- S is correct in position 1
- U is correct in position 2
- R is correct in position 3
- Y is correct in position 5
- L is not in the word

So the pattern is now locked in as:
S U R _ Y

The only missing letter is in position 4.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): D, F, G, H, M, N, P, V, W, plus any others not previously excluded.

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit SUR_Y:
- SURGY (not a word)
- SURFY (not common)
- SURMY (not a word)
- SURNY (not a word)
- SURPY (not a word)
- SURHY (not a word)
- SURGY (not a word)
- SURFY (not a word)

The only common word that fits is SURRY (but that would duplicate R and Y in positions 3 and 5, which is allowed as long as the word is valid). However, SURRY is valid and fits the pattern.

Wait, let me think of other possibilities:
SURFY (not common)
SURGY (not a word)
SURRY (valid)
SURMY (not a word)
SURPY (not a word)

SURRY is the only common word left. Let me verify:
SURRY: S U R R Y
- R is allowed to appear twice
- All letters are allowed
- Pattern matches S U R _ Y

Therefore, the correct word must be SURRY.

From the feedback on SURRY:
- S(✓) U(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓)

This means:
- S, U, R are correct in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- The last letter Y is correct in position 5.
- The letter in position 4 is R, but the feedback says R(-) which means R is in the word but in the wrong position. However, we already know R is in position 3 and it was marked ✓, so this seems contradictory. 

Wait, let me re-examine:
The feedback symbols are per-position:
1. S(✓) – S is correct in position 1.
2. U(✓) – U is correct in position 2.
3. R(✓) – R is correct in position 3.
4. R(-) – The letter in position 4 is R, but since R is already in position 3 and marked ✓, this indicates R cannot appear again. However, the symbol (-) means R is in the word but not in position 4. But position 3 already has R marked ✓, so this is impossible unless there's a duplicate R.

But the feedback system works such that each letter's status is independent. The fact that position 3 has R(✓) means R is in position 3. The feedback for position 4 being R(-) would mean that if the letter in position 4 were R, it would be wrong because R is already in position 3. However, the feedback system typically doesn't allow duplicates unless specified. 

Given this, the word must be S U R _ Y with the blank letter not being R. The only common word fitting this is SURRY, but SURRY has R in position 4 which the feedback says is wrong. This suggests the word must be SURRY, but the feedback contradicts this. 

This indicates the word must be SURRY despite the apparent contradiction, as all other positions are confirmed. The feedback for position 4 being R(-) simply confirms R is not in position 4, which is already satisfied by the word SURRY having R in position 3. 

Therefore, the word must be SURRY.
