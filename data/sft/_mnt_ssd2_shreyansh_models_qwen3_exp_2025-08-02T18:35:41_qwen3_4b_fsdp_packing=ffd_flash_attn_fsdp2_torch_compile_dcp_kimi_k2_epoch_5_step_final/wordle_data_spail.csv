For my first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""AUDIO."" 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E
- AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O

Among these, ""AROSE"" stands out because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and should help identify which vowels are in the word and their positions quickly. The letters A, R, O, S, E are all among the most frequent in English 5-letter words, making ""AROSE"" an excellent first guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N
2. Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:
   - S in position 1
   - A in position 3
   - I in position 4
3. We still need to determine the letters in positions 2 and 5.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ A I _

Letters already ruled out: R, O, E, T, N
Letters already confirmed present: S, A, I

We need two new letters (positions 2 and 5) that are not in the excluded set. Common remaining consonants and vowels include: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also know from the first guess that the word contains S and A, and we already have S and A placed correctly, so positions 2 and 5 can be filled with any of the remaining valid letters.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit the pattern S _ A I _ and use only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- SCALI – but L is allowed, C is allowed, but “SCALI” might not be common.
- SHADE – but D and E, and E is excluded.
- SHARK – but R is excluded.
- SPAIL – but L is allowed, P is allowed, but “SPAIL” is uncommon.
- SWAIL – but W is allowed, L is allowed, but “SWAIL” is uncommon.
- SLAIN – but N is excluded.
- SHAIL – same issue as above.

Actually, let’s list valid letters for positions 2 and 5:
Position 2: cannot be R, O, E, T, N, S, A, I
Possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Position 5: same, but also must make a valid word.

Looking for common words:
- S C A I _ – SCAR? No, needs 5 letters. SCALI is possible.
- S H A I _ – SHAIL? Not common.
- S P A I _ – SPAID? But D is allowed, and “SPAID” is a word.
- S W A I _ – SWAIL? Not common.
- S L A I _ – SLAIN? N is excluded.
- S B A I _ – SBAIL? Not a word.

“SPAID” seems the most plausible: S P A I D.
Check letters:
- S: position 1 (correct)
- P: new, allowed
- A: position 3 (correct)
- I: position 4 (correct)
- D: new, allowed
No excluded letters are used.

Therefore, “SPAID” is a strong next guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not the word.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, O, E.
- Letters that must appear somewhere: A, S.
- A is not in position 1, S is not in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that contains both A and S, does not contain R, O, or E, and places A and S in different positions than the feedback indicated.

Good next steps:
1. Use remaining common consonants (T, N, L, D, C, etc.).
2. Place A somewhere other than first position.
3. Place S somewhere other than fourth position.

Possible candidates:
- STAIN – but has I and N, and S in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed).
- SALTY – has S in position 1, A in position 2, but T, L, Y are all new.
- SLANT – S in 1, A in 3, L, N, T new.
- SPASM – repeats S, but has A in 3, S in 4 (invalid because S can't be in 4).
- STASH – S in 1, T, A in 3, S in 4 (invalid).

Best choice seems STAIN: contains A and S, avoids R, O, E, places A in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed), and introduces new letters T, I, N.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N
2. Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:
   - S in position 1
   - A in position 3
   - I in position 4
3. We still need to determine the letters in positions 2 and 5.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ A I _

Letters already ruled out: R, O, E, T, N
Letters already confirmed present: S, A, I

We need two new letters (positions 2 and 5) that are not in the excluded set. Common remaining consonants and vowels include: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also know from the first guess that the word contains S and A, and we already have S and A placed correctly, so positions 2 and 5 can be filled with any of the remaining valid letters.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit the pattern S _ A I _ and use only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- SCALI – but L is allowed, C is allowed, but “SCALI” might not be common.
- SHADE – but D and E, and E is excluded.
- SHARK – but R is excluded.
- SPAIL – but L is allowed, P is allowed, but “SPAIL” is uncommon.
- SWAIL – but W is allowed, L is allowed, but “SWAIL” is uncommon.
- SLAIN – but N is excluded.
- SHAIL – same issue as above.

Actually, let’s list valid letters for positions 2 and 5:
Position 2: cannot be R, O, E, T, N, S, A, I
Possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Position 5: same, but also must make a valid word.

Looking for common words:
- S C A I _ – SCAR? No, needs 5 letters. SCALI is possible.
- S H A I _ – SHAIL? Not common.
- S P A I _ – SPAID? But D is allowed, and “SPAID” is a word.
- S W A I _ – SWAIL? Not common.
- S L A I _ – SLAIN? N is excluded.
- S B A I _ – SBAIL? Not a word.

“SPAID” seems the most plausible: S P A I D.
Check letters:
- S: position 1 (correct)
- P: new, allowed
- A: position 3 (correct)
- I: position 4 (correct)
- D: new, allowed
No excluded letters are used.

Therefore, “SPAID” is a strong next guess.

For my first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""AUDIO."" 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E
- AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O

Among these, ""AROSE"" stands out because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and should help identify which vowels are in the word and their positions quickly. The letters A, R, O, S, E are all among the most frequent in English 5-letter words, making ""AROSE"" an excellent first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not the word.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, O, E.
- Letters that must appear somewhere: A, S.
- A is not in position 1, S is not in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that contains both A and S, does not contain R, O, or E, and places A and S in different positions than the feedback indicated.

Good next steps:
1. Use remaining common consonants (T, N, L, D, C, etc.).
2. Place A somewhere other than first position.
3. Place S somewhere other than fourth position.

Possible candidates:
- STAIN – but has I and N, and S in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed).
- SALTY – has S in position 1, A in position 2, but T, L, Y are all new.
- SLANT – S in 1, A in 3, L, N, T new.
- SPASM – repeats S, but has A in 3, S in 4 (invalid because S can't be in 4).
- STASH – S in 1, T, A in 3, S in 4 (invalid).

Best choice seems STAIN: contains A and S, avoids R, O, E, places A in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed), and introduces new letters T, I, N.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

2. Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:
   - S in position 1
   - A in position 3
   - I in position 4
3. We still need to determine the letters in positions 2 and 5.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ A I _

Letters already ruled out: R, O, E, T, N
Letters already confirmed present: S, A, I

We need two new letters (positions 2 and 5) that are not in the excluded set. Common remaining consonants and vowels include: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also know from the first guess that the word contains S and A, and we already have S and A placed correctly, so positions 2 and 5 can be filled with any of the remaining valid letters.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit the pattern S _ A I _ and use only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- SCALI – but L is allowed, C is allowed, but “SCALI” might not be common.
- SHADE – but D and E, and E is excluded.
- SHARK – but R is excluded.
- SPAIL – but L is allowed, P is allowed, but “SPAIL” is uncommon.
- SWAIL – but W is allowed, L is allowed, but “SWAIL” is uncommon.
- SLAIN – but N is excluded.
- SHAIL – same issue as above.

Actually, let’s list valid letters for positions 2 and 5:
Position 2: cannot be R, O, E, T, N, S, A, I
Possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Position 5: same, but also must make a valid word.

Looking for common words:
- S C A I _ – SCAR? No, needs 5 letters. SCALI is possible.
- S H A I _ – SHAIL? Not common.
- S P A I _ – SPAID? But D is allowed, and “SPAID” is a word.
- S W A I _ – SWAIL? Not common.
- S L A I _ – SLAIN? N is excluded.
- S B A I _ – SBAIL? Not a word.

“SPAID” seems the most plausible: S P A I D.
Check letters:
- S: position 1 (correct)
- P: new, allowed
- A: position 3 (correct)
- I: position 4 (correct)
- D: new, allowed
No excluded letters are used.

Therefore, “SPAID” is a strong next guess.
