### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these letters. Some popular starting words include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several very common letters in different positions.

Let's consolidate what we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, R, I

2. Letters that ARE in the word (but whose positions are still unknown):  
   - S (from SLATE: S(-)) and P (from CRISP: P(-)).

3. Positions ruled out so far:
   - S cannot be in position 1 (SLATE) or position 4 (CRISP).
   - P cannot be in position 5 (CRISP).

4. Remaining common letters to test: D, N, O, U, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc.

5. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Contains S and P (both confirmed present).
   - Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters: L, A, T, E, C, R, I.
   - Places S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4, and P somewhere other than position 5.

A good candidate is “SPUNK”:
   - S in position 1 → but S cannot be in position 1 (ruled out by SLATE).  
   So SPUNK is invalid.

Let's update what we know after the three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from all feedback):
L, A, T, E, C, R, I, U, N

Letters that ARE in the word (confirmed present):
S, P, O

Known positions:
- O is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- P is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from UPONS feedback: P(-))

So far the pattern looks like:
_ _ O _ S

We have two unknown positions (positions 1 and 2) and one confirmed letter P that must appear somewhere in the remaining positions (positions 1 or 4, since 2 is excluded for P).

Possible positions for P:
- Position 1
- Position 4

Letters we have not used yet (and are still allowed):
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any duplicates we haven't tested)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3
- Has S in position 5
- Contains P in either position 1 or 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Let's list possible words:

If P is in position 1:
P _ O _ S
Possible words: PODPS (invalid), POGOS (invalid), POKOS (invalid), etc. None seem valid.

If P is in position 4:
_ _ O P S
Possible words: BLOPS (invalid), DROPS (invalid), GLOPS (invalid), etc. None seem valid.

Wait, let's think of valid words fitting _ _ O P S:
- BLOPS: B, L, O, P, S → L is eliminated
- DROPS: D, R, O, P, S → R is eliminated
- GLOPS: G, L, O, P, S → L is eliminated
- HLOPS: invalid
- JLOPS: invalid
- KLOPS: invalid
- MLOPS: invalid
- VLOPS: invalid
- WLOPS: invalid

Hmm, none of these work. Let's try P in position 1 with other letters:
P _ O _ S
Possible words:
- POGOS: G, O, G, O, S → G is allowed, but is POGOS a valid word? It's a plural of pog, but not sure.
- POOPS: P, O, O, P, S → has two O's and two P's, but P is allowed, O is allowed. POOPS is a valid word (past tense of poop).
- POKOS: P, O, K, O, S → K is allowed, but POKOS is a proper noun (a brand), not sure if valid.
- POMPS: P, O, M, P, S → M is allowed, POMPS is valid.
- POGGS: P, O, G, G, S → G is allowed, but POGGS is plural of pog, not sure.

POOMPS: too long.

Between POOPS and POMPS, both fit the constraints:

  - O is in position 3 (✓)

  - O is in position 3 (✓)
  - S is in position 5 (✓)
  - P appears in positions 1 and 4 (both allowed)

POOMPS is invalid (6 letters). 

Between POOPS and POMPS, POMPS seems more likely.

But let's check if there's a better word. Another possibility is:
- POKOS: but K is allowed, POKOS is a valid word (plural of poko, but not common).
- POGGS: G is allowed, but POGGS is plural of pog.

POMPS seems the best choice.

But let's verify:
POMPS:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these letters. Some popular starting words include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several very common letters in different positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L(x), A(x), T(x), E(x) → L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S, but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than first position.
2. Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

Good letters to try next: R, I, N, O, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

A strong next guess would be CRISP:
- C: new letter
- R: new letter
- I: new letter
- S: known to be in word, placed in position 4
- P: new letter

This tests several new common letters while placing S in a new position.

Let's consolidate what we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, R, I  
   (from both rounds of feedback).

2. Letters that ARE in the word (but whose positions are still unknown):  
   - S (from SLATE: S(-)) and P (from CRISP: P(-)).

3. Positions ruled out so far:
   - S cannot be in position 1 (SLATE) or position 4 (CRISP).
   - P cannot be in position 5 (CRISP).

4. Remaining common letters to test: D, N, O, U, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc.

5. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Contains S and P (both confirmed present).
   - Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters: L, A, T, E, C, R, I.
   - Places S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4, and P somewhere other than position 5.

A good candidate is “SPUNK”:
   - S in position 1 → but S cannot be in position 1 (ruled out by SLATE).  
   So SPUNK is invalid.

Next candidate: “PUSKS” – but S is in position 5, and we don’t know if S can be in position 5; however, we also don’t have any info ruling it out yet.  
But PUSKS has S in position 5, which is allowed so far.

However, let’s try a word that spreads the confirmed letters more evenly: “SPOOF” – but it has O twice and F, but we haven’t tested O or F yet.  
But SPOOF has S in position 1 (invalid).

Another candidate: “SPUDS” – but S is in position 1 (invalid).

Let’s try “UPONS”:
   - U, P, O, N, S.  
   - S is in position 5 (allowed so far).  
   - P is in position 2 (allowed).  
   - Uses new letters U, O, N.

Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from all feedback):
L, A, T, E, C, R, I, U, N, M

Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- P is in position 1 (✓ from POMPS)
- O is in position 3 (✓ from UPONS and POMPS)
- S is in position 5 (✓ from UPONS and POMPS)

So the pattern is now:
P _ O _ S

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with P
- Has O in position 3
- Ends with S
- Uses only allowed letters in positions 2 and 4

Possible letters for positions 2 and 4: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's list valid words fitting P _ O _ S:
- POGGS: G is allowed, but POGGS is plural of pog (not common)
- POKOS: K is allowed, POKOS is plural of poko (not common)
- POOPS: P, O, O, P, S → has two O's and two P's, but O is already in position 3, and P is already in position 1
- POMPS: already tried (M is eliminated)
- POGOS: G is allowed, but POGOS is plural of pog (not common)

Looking at allowed letters, the most straightforward valid word is ""POOPS"", but it repeats O and P, which might not be necessary. However, ""POOPS"" is a valid English word.

Another possibility is ""POKOS"", but K is less common.

Between these, ""POOPS"" seems the best choice as it uses allowed letters and fits the pattern.

But let's check if there's a better word. Another valid word is ""POKES"", but K is allowed and E is eliminated.

Actually, we need to check if any letters are allowed. The eliminated letters are L, A, T, E, C, R, I, U, N, M. So K is allowed.

""POKES"" would be P O K E S, but E is eliminated.

""POKOS"" is P O K O S, which uses allowed letters K and O (O is allowed in position 2, and position 3 is already O).

This seems valid.

Between ""POOPS"" and ""POKOS"", ""POKOS"" is more likely as it uses K which is allowed.

But let's think of other possibilities. ""POGGS"" is P O G G S, which uses G twice. G is allowed.

""POGGS"" seems valid.

However, ""POGGS"" is plural of ""pog"", which might not be common.

Another valid word is ""POKOS"".

But let's check if there's a more common word. ""POKOS"" is not very common, but ""POKES"" is invalid due to E.

""POKOS"" seems the closest.

But let's think differently: positions 2 and 4 can be any allowed letters. The simplest valid word is ""POKOS"".

However, let's verify:
P(1) O(2) K(3) O(4) S(5) - but position 3 must be O, so this is invalid.

Wait, the pattern is P _ O _ S, so positions:
1: P
2: ?
3: O
4: ?
5: S

So valid words:
- P B O K S → ""PBOKS"" (invalid)
- P D O K S → ""PDOKS"" (invalid)
- P G O K S → ""PGOKS"" (invalid)
- P H O K S → ""PHOKS"" (invalid)
- P J O K S → ""PJOKS"" (invalid)
- P K O K S → ""PKOKS"" (invalid)
- P V O K S → ""PVOKS"" (invalid)
- P W O K S → ""PWOKS"" (invalid)
- P Y O K S → ""PYOKS"" (invalid)
- P Z O K S → ""PZOKS"" (invalid)

This approach isn't yielding valid words. Let's think of actual English words.

Valid English words fitting P _ O _ S:
- POGGS
- POKOS
- POOPS
- POGOS

Among these, ""POOGS"" is invalid (not a word), ""POKES"" is invalid (E eliminated), ""POOGS"" is invalid.

""POOGS"" is invalid.

""POKOS"" is the closest valid word.

But let's check ""POKOS"":
- P(1) O(2) K(3) O(4) S(5) - but position 3 must be O, so this is invalid.

Wait, the pattern is P _ O _ S, so:
1: P
2: ?
3: O
4: ?
5: S

So valid words:
- P B O D S → ""PBO DS"" (invalid)
- P B O G S → ""PBOGS"" (invalid)
- P B O K S → ""PBOKS"" (invalid)
- P B O V S → ""PBOVS"" (invalid)
- P D O G S → ""PDOGS"" (invalid)
- P D O K S → ""PDOKS"" (invalid)
- P F O G S → ""PFOGS"" (invalid)
- P G O G S → ""PGOGS"" (invalid)
- P G O K S → ""PGOKS"" (invalid)
- P H O G S → ""PHOGS"" (invalid)
- P J O G S → ""PJOGS"" (invalid)
- P K O G S → ""PKOGS"" (invalid)
- P V O G S → ""PVOGS"" (invalid)
- P W O G S → ""PWOGS"" (invalid)
- P Y O G S → ""PYOGS"" (invalid)
- P Z O G S → ""PZOGS"" (invalid)

This is not working. Let's think of actual words.

Valid English words fitting P _ O _ S:
- POGGS
- POKOS
- POOPS
- POGOS

""POGGS"" is plural of ""pog"", ""POKOS"" is plural of ""poko"", ""POOPS"" is valid, ""POGOS"" is plural of ""pogo"".

Among these, ""POOPS"" is the most common word.

Let's verify:
P(1) O(2) O(3) P(4) S(5)
- P is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- P is in position 4 (allowed, since P can be in position 4 as it's not ruled out)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""POOPS"".
</think>

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- P is in position 1
- O is in position 3
- S is in position 5
- M is eliminated, so the pattern is P _ O _ S

The most common valid word fitting this pattern is ""POOPS"".

<guess>POOPS</guess>",POOPS,"Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from all feedback):

We need a 5-letter word that:

Possible letters for positions 2 and 4: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's list valid words fitting P _ O _ S:

Actually, we need to check if any letters are allowed. The eliminated letters are L, A, T, E, C, R, I, U, N, M. So K is allowed.

""POKES"" would be P O K E S, but E is eliminated.

""POKOS"" is P O K O S, which uses allowed letters K and O (O is allowed in position 2, and position 3 is already O).

This seems valid.

Between ""POOPS"" and ""POKOS"", ""POKOS"" is more likely as it uses K which is allowed.

But let's think of other possibilities. ""POGGS"" is P O G G S, which uses G twice. G is allowed.

""POGGS"" seems valid.

However, ""POGGS"" is plural of ""pog"", which might not be common.

Another valid word is ""POKOS"".

But let's check if there's a more common word. ""POKOS"" is not very common, but ""POKES"" is invalid due to E.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these letters. Some popular starting words include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several very common letters in different positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L(x), A(x), T(x), E(x) → L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S, but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than first position.
2. Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

Good letters to try next: R, I, N, O, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

A strong next guess would be CRISP:
- C: new letter
- R: new letter
- I: new letter
- S: known to be in word, placed in position 4
- P: new letter

This tests several new common letters while placing S in a new position.

Let's consolidate what we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, R, I  
   (from both rounds of feedback).

2. Letters that ARE in the word (but whose positions are still unknown):  
   - S (from SLATE: S(-)) and P (from CRISP: P(-)).

3. Positions ruled out so far:
   - S cannot be in position 1 (SLATE) or position 4 (CRISP).
   - P cannot be in position 5 (CRISP).

4. Remaining common letters to test: D, N, O, U, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc.

5. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Contains S and P (both confirmed present).
   - Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters: L, A, T, E, C, R, I.
   - Places S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4, and P somewhere other than position 5.

A good candidate is “SPUNK”:
   - S in position 1 → but S cannot be in position 1 (ruled out by SLATE).  
   So SPUNK is invalid.

Next candidate: “PUSKS” – but S is in position 5, and we don’t know if S can be in position 5; however, we also don’t have any info ruling it out yet.  
But PUSKS has S in position 5, which is allowed so far.

However, let’s try a word that spreads the confirmed letters more evenly: “SPOOF” – but it has O twice and F, but we haven’t tested O or F yet.  
But SPOOF has S in position 1 (invalid).

Another candidate: “SPUDS” – but S is in position 1 (invalid).

Let’s try “UPONS”:
   - U, P, O, N, S.  
   - S is in position 5 (allowed so far).  
   - P is in position 2 (allowed).  
   - Uses new letters U, O, N.

This seems valid and informative.

Let's update what we know after the three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from all feedback):
L, A, T, E, C, R, I, U, N

Letters that ARE in the word (confirmed present):
S, P, O

Known positions:
- O is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- P is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from UPONS feedback: P(-))

So far the pattern looks like:
_ _ O _ S

We have two unknown positions (positions 1 and 2) and one confirmed letter P that must appear somewhere in the remaining positions (positions 1 or 4, since 2 is excluded for P).

Possible positions for P:
- Position 1
- Position 4

Letters we have not used yet (and are still allowed):
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any duplicates we haven't tested)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3
- Has S in position 5
- Contains P in either position 1 or 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Let's list possible words:

If P is in position 1:
P _ O _ S
Possible words: PODPS (invalid), POGOS (invalid), POKOS (invalid), etc. None seem valid.

If P is in position 4:
_ _ O P S
Possible words: BLOPS (invalid), DROPS (invalid), GLOPS (invalid), etc. None seem valid.

Wait, let's think of valid words fitting _ _ O P S:
- BLOPS: B, L, O, P, S → L is eliminated
- DROPS: D, R, O, P, S → R is eliminated
- GLOPS: G, L, O, P, S → L is eliminated
- HLOPS: invalid
- JLOPS: invalid
- KLOPS: invalid
- MLOPS: invalid
- VLOPS: invalid
- WLOPS: invalid
- YLOPS: invalid
- ZLOPS: invalid

Hmm, none of these work. Let's try P in position 1 with other letters:
P _ O _ S
Possible words:
- POGOS: G, O, G, O, S → G is allowed, but is POGOS a valid word? It's a plural of pog, but not sure.
- POOPS: P, O, O, P, S → has two O's and two P's, but P is allowed, O is allowed. POOPS is a valid word (past tense of poop).
- POKOS: P, O, K, O, S → K is allowed, but POKOS is a proper noun (a brand), not sure if valid.
- POMPS: P, O, M, P, S → M is allowed, POMPS is valid.
- POGGS: P, O, G, G, S → G is allowed, but POGGS is plural of pog, not sure.

POOMPS: too long.

Between POOPS and POMPS, both fit the constraints:
- POOPS: P, O, O, P, S → positions: P(1), O(2), O(3), P(4), S(5)
  - O is in position 3 (✓)
  - S is in position 5 (✓)
  - P appears in positions 1 and 4 (both allowed)
- POMPS: P, O, M, P, S → positions: P(1), O(2), M(3), P(4), S(5)
  - O is in position 3 (✓)
  - S is in position 5 (✓)
  - P appears in positions 1 and 4 (both allowed)

POOMPS is invalid (6 letters). 

Between POOPS and POMPS, POMPS seems more likely.

But let's check if there's a better word. Another possibility is:
- POKOS: but K is allowed, POKOS is a valid word (plural of poko, but not common).
- POGGS: G is allowed, but POGGS is plural of pog.

POMPS seems the best choice.

But let's verify:
POMPS:
- P(1): allowed (not yet ruled out)
- O(2): allowed (not yet ruled out)
- M(3): allowed (not yet ruled out)
- P(4): allowed (not yet ruled out)
- S(5): allowed (✓)

This fits all constraints.Based on the feedback, we know:
- O is in position 3
- S is in position 5
- P must appear somewhere in the word (not in position 2)
- Eliminated letters: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, U, N

A valid word fitting _ _ O _ S with P in position 1 or 4 is ""POMPS"".

Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from all feedback):
L, A, T, E, C, R, I, U, N, M

Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- P is in position 1 (✓ from POMPS)
- O is in position 3 (✓ from UPONS and POMPS)
- S is in position 5 (✓ from UPONS and POMPS)

So the pattern is now:
P _ O _ S

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with P
- Has O in position 3
- Ends with S
- Uses only allowed letters in positions 2 and 4

Possible letters for positions 2 and 4: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's list valid words fitting P _ O _ S:
- POGGS: G is allowed, but POGGS is plural of pog (not common)
- POKOS: K is allowed, POKOS is plural of poko (not common)
- POOPS: P, O, O, P, S → has two O's and two P's, but O is already in position 3, and P is already in position 1
- POMPS: already tried (M is eliminated)
- POGOS: G is allowed, but POGOS is plural of pog (not common)

Looking at allowed letters, the most straightforward valid word is ""POOPS"", but it repeats O and P, which might not be necessary. However, ""POOPS"" is a valid English word.

Another possibility is ""POKOS"", but K is less common.

Between these, ""POOPS"" seems the best choice as it uses allowed letters and fits the pattern.

But let's check if there's a better word. Another valid word is ""POKES"", but K is allowed and E is eliminated.

Actually, we need to check if any letters are allowed. The eliminated letters are L, A, T, E, C, R, I, U, N, M. So K is allowed.

""POKES"" would be P O K E S, but E is eliminated.

""POKOS"" is P O K O S, which uses allowed letters K and O (O is allowed in position 2, and position 3 is already O).

This seems valid.

Between ""POOPS"" and ""POKOS"", ""POKOS"" is more likely as it uses K which is allowed.

But let's think of other possibilities. ""POGGS"" is P O G G S, which uses G twice. G is allowed.

""POGGS"" seems valid.

However, ""POGGS"" is plural of ""pog"", which might not be common.

Another valid word is ""POKOS"".

But let's check if there's a more common word. ""POKOS"" is not very common, but ""POKES"" is invalid due to E.

""POKOS"" seems the closest.

But let's think differently: positions 2 and 4 can be any allowed letters. The simplest valid word is ""POKOS"".

However, let's verify:
P(1) O(2) K(3) O(4) S(5) - but position 3 must be O, so this is invalid.

Wait, the pattern is P _ O _ S, so positions:
1: P
2: ?
3: O
4: ?
5: S

So valid words:
- P B O K S → ""PBOKS"" (invalid)
- P D O K S → ""PDOKS"" (invalid)
- P G O K S → ""PGOKS"" (invalid)
- P H O K S → ""PHOKS"" (invalid)
- P J O K S → ""PJOKS"" (invalid)
- P K O K S → ""PKOKS"" (invalid)
- P V O K S → ""PVOKS"" (invalid)
- P W O K S → ""PWOKS"" (invalid)
- P Y O K S → ""PYOKS"" (invalid)
- P Z O K S → ""PZOKS"" (invalid)

This approach isn't yielding valid words. Let's think of actual English words.

Valid English words fitting P _ O _ S:
- POGGS
- POKOS
- POOPS
- POGOS

Among these, ""POOGS"" is invalid (not a word), ""POKES"" is invalid (E eliminated), ""POOGS"" is invalid.

""POOGS"" is invalid.

""POKOS"" is the closest valid word.

But let's check ""POKOS"":
- P(1) O(2) K(3) O(4) S(5) - but position 3 must be O, so this is invalid.

Wait, the pattern is P _ O _ S, so:
1: P
2: ?
3: O
4: ?
5: S

So valid words:
- P B O D S → ""PBO DS"" (invalid)
- P B O G S → ""PBOGS"" (invalid)
- P B O K S → ""PBOKS"" (invalid)
- P B O V S → ""PBOVS"" (invalid)
- P D O G S → ""PDOGS"" (invalid)
- P D O K S → ""PDOKS"" (invalid)
- P F O G S → ""PFOGS"" (invalid)
- P G O G S → ""PGOGS"" (invalid)
- P G O K S → ""PGOKS"" (invalid)
- P H O G S → ""PHOGS"" (invalid)
- P J O G S → ""PJOGS"" (invalid)
- P K O G S → ""PKOGS"" (invalid)
- P V O G S → ""PVOGS"" (invalid)
- P W O G S → ""PWOGS"" (invalid)
- P Y O G S → ""PYOGS"" (invalid)
- P Z O G S → ""PZOGS"" (invalid)

This is not working. Let's think of actual words.

Valid English words fitting P _ O _ S:
- POGGS
- POKOS
- POOPS
- POGOS

""POGGS"" is plural of ""pog"", ""POKOS"" is plural of ""poko"", ""POOPS"" is valid, ""POGOS"" is plural of ""pogo"".

Among these, ""POOPS"" is the most common word.

Let's verify:
P(1) O(2) O(3) P(4) S(5)
- P is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- P is in position 4 (allowed, since P can be in position 4 as it's not ruled out)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""POOPS"".Based on the feedback, we now know:
- P is in position 1
- O is in position 3
- S is in position 5
- M is eliminated, so the pattern is P _ O _ S

The most common valid word fitting this pattern is ""POOPS"".

Let's consolidate everything we now know after five guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from all feedback):
L, A, T, E, C, R, I, U, N, M, O (from POOPS feedback: the second O is ✓, so O is confirmed in position 3, not eliminated)

Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- P is in position 1 (✓ from POMPS and POOPS)
- O is in position 3 (✓ from UPONS, POMPS, POOPS)
- S is in position 5 (✓ from UPONS, POMPS, POOPS)

So the pattern is:
P _ O _ S

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with P
- Has O in position 3
- Ends with S
- Uses only allowed letters in positions 2 and 4

Possible letters for positions 2 and 4: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for valid English words that fit P _ O _ S:
- POGGS: G is allowed, but POGGS is plural of pog (not common)
- POKOS: K is allowed, POKOS is plural of poko (not common)
- POOPS: already tried
- POGOS: G is allowed, POGOS is plural of pogo (not common)

Actually, the only common word left seems to be ""POKES"", but E is eliminated.

Rechecking allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Valid words fitting P _ O _ S:
- POGGS
- POKOS
- POOPS
- POGOS

""POOPS"" is already tried. ""POKOS"" and ""POGGS"" are less common. ""POGOS"" is plural of pogo.

But ""POGOS"" is a valid English word (plural of pogo).

Let's verify:
P(1) O(2) G(3) O(4) S(5)
- P is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- G is allowed (not eliminated)
- O is in position 4 (allowed, since O can appear twice)

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""POGOS"".

<guess>POGOS</guess>",POGOS,"Let's consolidate everything we now know after five guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from all feedback):
L, A, T, E, C, R, I, U, N, M, O (from POOPS feedback: the second O is ✓, so O is confirmed in position 3, not eliminated)

Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- P is in position 1 (✓ from POMPS and POOPS)
- O is in position 3 (✓ from UPONS, POMPS, POOPS)
- S is in position 5 (✓ from UPONS, POMPS, POOPS)

So the pattern is:
P _ O _ S

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with P
- Has O in position 3
- Ends with S
- Uses only allowed letters in positions 2 and 4

Possible letters for positions 2 and 4: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for valid English words that fit P _ O _ S:
- POGGS: G is allowed, but POGGS is plural of pog (not common)
- POKOS: K is allowed, POKOS is plural of poko (not common)
- POOPS: already tried
- POGOS: G is allowed, POGOS is plural of pogo (not common)

Actually, the only common word left seems to be ""POKES"", but E is eliminated.
