For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving me a broad coverage of possible letters in the secret word. This will help me gather maximum information about which letters are present and their positions.

   - S is now known to be in position 5 (✓).  
   - The second O (in position 4) is still in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:
- Word structure: _ O _ _ S  
- Letters that must appear: O (pos 2), S (pos 5), and another O somewhere else (but not pos 4).  
- Letters that must NOT appear: A, R, E, F.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2 and S in position 5.  
- Has another O in position 1 or 3 (since pos 4 is excluded for the second O).  
- Uses only letters not in {A, R, E, F}.

Candidate words:
- O O _ _ S → ""OOBS?"" – but B is allowed, but we need a valid word.  
- _ O O _ S → ""COOS?"" – but C is allowed, but we need a valid word.  
- _ O _ O S → but this would place the second O in position 4, which is invalid.  
- _ O _ _ S with an O in position 1: ""OO"" at start, e.g., ""OOBS"" is not a word.  
- ""COOS"" is a valid word (British English for ""cooed""), but it has O in positions 1, 2, and 5.  
- ""DOORS"" is invalid because it has R.  
- ""POOS"" is not a valid word.  
- ""GOONS"" is invalid because it has N, but let's check: G O O N S – but we don't know about N yet.  
- ""GOONS"" is actually a valid word, and it satisfies:
  - O in position 2 (✓).  
  - S in position 5 (✓).  
  - Another O in position 3 (allowed, since only position 4 was excluded for the second O).  
  - Uses only allowed letters (G, O, N, S).

Thus, ""GOONS"" is a strong candidate.

However, ""GOONS"" has N, which we haven't tested yet. A safer choice is ""COOS"", but it's less common. Another valid word is ""BOONS"" (B, O, O, N, S), but it has N again.

The most straightforward valid word is ""GOONS"".

But let me double-check:  
- ""GOONS"" letters: G, O, O, N, S.  
- None of G, N are in the forbidden set {A, R, E, F}.  
- O is in position 2 (✓).  
- S is in position 5 (✓).  
- The second O is in position 3 (allowed).  

Therefore, ""GOONS"" is a valid next guess.

- _ O _ O S → but this would place the second O in position 4, which is invalid.  
- _ O _ _ S with an O in position 1: ""OO"" at start, e.g., ""OOBS"" is not a word.  
- ""COOS"" is a valid word (British English for ""cooed""), but it has O in positions 1, 2, and 5.  
- ""DOORS"" is invalid because it has R.  
- ""POOS"" is not a valid word.  
- ""GOONS"" is invalid because it has N, but let's check: G O O N S – but we don't know about N yet.  
- ""GOONS"" is actually a valid word, and it satisfies:
  - O in position 2 (✓).  
  - S in position 5 (✓).  
  - Another O in position 3 (allowed, since only position 4 was excluded for the second O).  
  - Uses only allowed letters (G, O, N, S).

Thus, ""GOONS"" is a strong candidate.

However, ""GOONS"" has N, which we haven't tested yet. A safer choice is ""COOS"", but it's less common. Another valid word is ""BOONS"" (B, O, O, N, S), but it has N again.

The most straightforward valid word is ""GOONS"".

But let me double-check:  
- ""GOONS"" letters: G, O, O, N, S.  
- None of G, N are in the forbidden set {A, R, E, F}.  
- O is in position 2 (✓).  
- S is in position 5 (✓).  
- The second O is in position 3 (allowed).  

Therefore, ""GOONS"" is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving me a broad coverage of possible letters in the secret word. This will help me gather maximum information about which letters are present and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O and S.
2. O is not in position 3.
3. S is not in position 4.
4. Does not contain A, R, or E.

Let’s pick a word that uses common letters and satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is ""SOLOS"":
- It has S and O.
- O is in position 2 (not 3), S is in positions 1 and 4 (so 4th S is allowed since the feedback only said S is not in 4th position of arose, not globally).
- It avoids A, R, E.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E  
   - Letters IN the word but in wrong positions: O, S

2. sofos → S(-) O(✓) F(x) O(-) S(✓)  
   - Letters NOT in the word: F  
   - O is now known to be in position 2 (✓).  
   - S is now known to be in position 5 (✓).  
   - The second O (in position 4) is still in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:
- Word structure: _ O _ _ S  
- Letters that must appear: O (pos 2), S (pos 5), and another O somewhere else (but not pos 4).  
- Letters that must NOT appear: A, R, E, F.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2 and S in position 5.  
- Has another O in position 1 or 3 (since pos 4 is excluded for the second O).  
- Uses only letters not in {A, R, E, F}.

Candidate words:
- O O _ _ S → ""OOBS?"" – but B is allowed, but we need a valid word.  
- _ O O _ S → ""COOS?"" – but C is allowed, but we need a valid word.  
- _ O _ O S → but this would place the second O in position 4, which is invalid.  
- _ O _ _ S with an O in position 1: ""OO"" at start, e.g., ""OOBS"" is not a word.  
- ""COOS"" is a valid word (British English for ""cooed""), but it has O in positions 1, 2, and 5.  
- ""DOORS"" is invalid because it has R.  
- ""POOS"" is not a valid word.  
- ""GOONS"" is invalid because it has N, but let's check: G O O N S – but we don't know about N yet.  
- ""GOONS"" is actually a valid word, and it satisfies:
  - O in position 2 (✓).  
  - S in position 5 (✓).  
  - Another O in position 3 (allowed, since only position 4 was excluded for the second O).  
  - Uses only allowed letters (G, O, N, S).

Thus, ""GOONS"" is a strong candidate.

However, ""GOONS"" has N, which we haven't tested yet. A safer choice is ""COOS"", but it's less common. Another valid word is ""BOONS"" (B, O, O, N, S), but it has N again.

The most straightforward valid word is ""GOONS"".

But let me double-check:  
- ""GOONS"" letters: G, O, O, N, S.  
- None of G, N are in the forbidden set {A, R, E, F}.  
- O is in position 2 (✓).  
- S is in position 5 (✓).  
- The second O is in position 3 (allowed).

From the feedback on G O B O S (gobos):
- G(✓) → position 1 correct.
- O(✓) → position 2 correct.
- B(x) → B is not in the word.
- O(-) → there is another O in the word, but not in position 4 (since the previous O was in position 2, and this one is in position 4, so it's indicating the second O is not in position 4).
- S(✓) → position 5 correct.

So far we know:
- Word structure: G O _ _ S
- Must contain exactly one more O somewhere in positions 3 or 4, but:
  - From goons: O is not in position 3.
  - From gobos: O is not in position 4.
- This is a contradiction unless there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- In goons: G O O N S → feedback was G(✓) O(✓) O(-) N(x) S(✓). The third letter (O) was marked (-), meaning it's in the word but wrong position. This implies there's another O in the word, but not in position 3.
- In gobos: G O B O S → feedback was G(✓) O(✓) B(x) O(-) S(✓). The fourth letter (O) was marked (-), meaning it's in the word but wrong position. This implies the second O is not in position 4.

Therefore, the only remaining position for the second O is position 3, but goons' feedback said it's not in position 3. This is impossible unless the word has two O's in positions 2 and 3, but position 2 is already O.

This suggests the word must have exactly one O in position 2, and the feedback indicating another O is actually referring to a different letter being O. Wait, no - the feedback is for each letter in the guess.

Re-examining:
- goons: G O O N S → G(✓) O(✓) O(-) N(x) S(✓)
  - The first O is correct in position 2.
  - The second O (position 3) is in the word but wrong position. This implies the word has an O in position 3, but that's impossible because position 2 is already O. This suggests the word cannot have two O's, so the feedback must be indicating that the second O is not in position 3.

Similarly, gobos: G O B O S → G(✓) O(✓) B(x) O(-) S(✓)
  - The first O is correct in position 2.
  - The second O (position 4) is in the word but wrong position. This implies the word has an O in position 4, but position 2 is already O. This is impossible unless the word has two O's, but position 2 is already O.

This contradiction suggests the word must have exactly one O in position 2, and the feedback about another O is actually indicating that the letter in position 3 or 4 is O but in wrong position, implying the word has no other O. This seems like a misinterpretation.

Wait, let's re-read the feedback carefully:
- goons: G(✓) O(✓) O(-) N(x) S(✓)
  - The third letter (O) is in the word but wrong position. This implies the word has an O in position 3, but position 2 is already O. This is impossible unless the word has two O's, which would require the second O to be in position 3.

Similarly, gobos: G O B O S → G(✓) O(✓) B(x) O(-) S(✓)
  - The fourth letter (O) is in the word but wrong position. This implies the word has an O in position 4.

This suggests the word must have two O's: one in position 2 and another in position 4. This seems possible.

So the structure is: G O _ O S

Letters not yet ruled out: any except A, R, E, F, N, B.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form G O _ O S.

Possible letters for position 3: C, D, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- G O C O S – ""GO COS"" is not a word.
- G O D O S – ""GODOS"" is not standard.
- G O H O S – ""GOHOS"" is not a word.

Hmm, none of these are valid. This suggests the word must have only one O in position 2, and the feedback indicating another O is actually referring to a different letter being O, implying the word has no other O. This seems like the only resolution.

Therefore, the word structure is: G O _ _ S with no other O's.

Therefore, ""GOLDS"" is the next logical guess.

Based on the feedback:
- G is fixed in position 1.
- O is fixed in position 2.
- S is fixed in position 5.
- There is no second O in positions 3 or 4 (the feedback from gobos showed the fourth letter O was in the wrong position, but since position 2 is already O, this implies no other O exists).

Thus, the word must be G O _ _ S with no additional O. The only valid word fitting this is ""GOLDS"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving me a broad coverage of possible letters in the secret word. This will help me gather maximum information about which letters are present and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O and S.
2. O is not in position 3.
3. S is not in position 4.
4. Does not contain A, R, or E.

Let’s pick a word that uses common letters and satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is ""SOLOS"":
- It has S and O.
- O is in position 2 (not 3), S is in positions 1 and 4 (so 4th S is allowed since the feedback only said S is not in 4th position of arose, not globally).
- It avoids A, R, E.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E  
   - Letters IN the word but in wrong positions: O, S

2. sofos → S(-) O(✓) F(x) O(-) S(✓)  
   - Letters NOT in the word: F  
   - O is now known to be in position 2 (✓).  
   - S is now known to be in position 5 (✓).  
   - The second O (in position 4) is still in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:
- Word structure: _ O _ _ S  
- Letters that must appear: O (pos 2), S (pos 5), and another O somewhere else (but not pos 4).  
- Letters that must NOT appear: A, R, E, F.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2 and S in position 5.  
- Has another O in position 1 or 3 (since pos 4 is excluded for the second O).  
- Uses only letters not in {A, R, E, F}.

Candidate words:
- O O _ _ S → ""OOBS?"" – but B is allowed, but we need a valid word.  
- _ O O _ S → ""COOS?"" – but C is allowed, but we need a valid word.  
- _ O _ O S → but this would place the second O in position 4, which is invalid.  
- _ O _ _ S with an O in position 1: ""OO"" at start, e.g., ""OOBS"" is not a word.  
- ""COOS"" is a valid word (British English for ""cooed""), but it has O in positions 1, 2, and 5.  
- ""DOORS"" is invalid because it has R.  
- ""POOS"" is not a valid word.  
- ""GOONS"" is invalid because it has N, but let's check: G O O N S – but we don't know about N yet.  
- ""GOONS"" is actually a valid word, and it satisfies:
  - O in position 2 (✓).  
  - S in position 5 (✓).  
  - Another O in position 3 (allowed, since only position 4 was excluded for the second O).  
  - Uses only allowed letters (G, O, N, S).

Thus, ""GOONS"" is a strong candidate.

However, ""GOONS"" has N, which we haven't tested yet. A safer choice is ""COOS"", but it's less common. Another valid word is ""BOONS"" (B, O, O, N, S), but it has N again.

The most straightforward valid word is ""GOONS"".

But let me double-check:  
- ""GOONS"" letters: G, O, O, N, S.  
- None of G, N are in the forbidden set {A, R, E, F}.  
- O is in position 2 (✓).  
- S is in position 5 (✓).  
- The second O is in position 3 (allowed).  

Therefore, ""GOONS"" is a valid next guess.

- GLOBS – but position 4 would be B, not O.
- GOLOS – but L is allowed, but ""GOLos"" is not a standard word.
- GOHOOS – too long.
- GOBOs – plural, but ""GOBO"" is 4 letters.
- GOVOR – but V is allowed, but ""GOVOR"" is not standard.

The only common valid word fitting G O _ O S is ""GOBOS"".

Let's verify:
- G O B O S
- G(✓) O(✓) B(new) O(✓) S(✓)
- No forbidden letters (A, R, E, F, N) are present.
- Structure matches all constraints.

Therefore, ""GOBOS"" is the next logical guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: sofos -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) F(x) O(-) S(✓)
Guess 3: goons -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) O(✓) O(-) N(x) S(✓)
Guess 4: gobos -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) O(✓) B(x) O(-) S(✓)

From the feedback on G O B O S (gobos):
- G(✓) → position 1 correct.
- O(✓) → position 2 correct.
- B(x) → B is not in the word.
- O(-) → there is another O in the word, but not in position 4 (since the previous O was in position 2, and this one is in position 4, so it's indicating the second O is not in position 4).
- S(✓) → position 5 correct.

So far we know:
- Word structure: G O _ _ S
- Must contain exactly one more O somewhere in positions 3 or 4, but:
  - From goons: O is not in position 3.
  - From gobos: O is not in position 4.
- This is a contradiction unless there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- In goons: G O O N S → feedback was G(✓) O(✓) O(-) N(x) S(✓). The third letter (O) was marked (-), meaning it's in the word but wrong position. This implies there's another O in the word, but not in position 3.
- In gobos: G O B O S → feedback was G(✓) O(✓) B(x) O(-) S(✓). The fourth letter (O) was marked (-), meaning it's in the word but wrong position. This implies the second O is not in position 4.

Therefore, the only remaining position for the second O is position 3, but goons' feedback said it's not in position 3. This is impossible unless the word has two O's in positions 2 and 3, but position 2 is already O.

This suggests the word must have exactly one O in position 2, and the feedback indicating another O is actually referring to a different letter being O. Wait, no - the feedback is for each letter in the guess.

Re-examining:
- goons: G O O N S → G(✓) O(✓) O(-) N(x) S(✓)
  - The first O is correct in position 2.
  - The second O (position 3) is in the word but wrong position. This implies the word has an O in position 3, but that's impossible because position 2 is already O. This suggests the word cannot have two O's, so the feedback must be indicating that the second O is not in position 3.

Similarly, gobos: G O B O S → G(✓) O(✓) B(x) O(-) S(✓)
  - The first O is correct in position 2.
  - The second O (position 4) is in the word but wrong position. This implies the word has an O in position 4, but position 2 is already O. This is impossible unless the word has two O's, but position 2 is already O.

This contradiction suggests the word must have exactly one O in position 2, and the feedback about another O is actually indicating that the letter in position 3 or 4 is O but in wrong position, implying the word has no other O. This seems like a misinterpretation.

Wait, let's re-read the feedback carefully:
- goons: G(✓) O(✓) O(-) N(x) S(✓)
  - The third letter (O) is in the word but wrong position. This implies the word has an O in position 3, but position 2 is already O. This is impossible unless the word has two O's, which would require the second O to be in position 3.

Similarly, gobos: G O B O S → G(✓) O(✓) B(x) O(-) S(✓)
  - The fourth letter (O) is in the word but wrong position. This implies the word has an O in position 4.

This suggests the word must have two O's: one in position 2 and another in position 4. This seems possible.

So the structure is: G O _ O S

Letters not yet ruled out: any except A, R, E, F, N, B.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form G O _ O S.

Possible letters for position 3: C, D, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Checking common words:
- G O C O S – ""GO COS"" is not a word.
- G O D O S – ""GODOS"" is not standard.
- G O H O S – ""GOHOS"" is not a word.
- G O K O S – ""GOKOS"" is not a word.
- G O L O S – ""GOLOS"" is not standard.
- G O M O S – ""GOMOS"" is not a word.
- G O P O S – ""GOPOS"" is not a word.
- G O T O S – ""GOTOS"" is not a word.
- G O V O S – ""GOVOS"" is not a word.
- G O W O S – ""GOWOS"" is not a word.
- G O Y O S – ""GOYOS"" is not a word.

Hmm, none of these are valid. This suggests the word must have only one O in position 2, and the feedback indicating another O is actually referring to a different letter being O, implying the word has no other O. This seems like the only resolution.

Therefore, the word structure is: G O _ _ S with no other O's.

Letters for positions 3 and 4: any not in A, R, E, F, N, B.

Possible letters: C, D, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form G O _ _ S.

Possible words:
- G O C K S – ""GOCKS"" is not standard.
- G O D Z S – ""GODZS"" is not a word.
- G O L F S – but F is ruled out.
- G O L D S – ""GOLDS"" is valid.
- G O L F S – invalid (F ruled out).
- G O L K S – ""GOLKS"" is not a word.
- G O L M S – ""GOLMS"" is not a word.
- G O L T S – ""GOLTS"" is not a word.
- G O L U S – ""GOLUS"" is not a word.
- G O L V S – ""GOLVS"" is not a word.
- G O L Y S – ""GOLYS"" is not a word.
- G O M P S – ""GOMPS"" is not a word.
- G O N D S – N is ruled out.
- G O P S – too short.
- G O P S – no.
- G O R D S – R is ruled out.
- G O S P S – S is in position 5.
- G O T S – too short.
- G O U G S – ""GOUGS"" is not a word.
- G O V E S – E is ruled out.
- G O W S – too short.
- G O Z Z S – ""GOZZS"" is not a word.

The only valid word I can find is ""GOLDS"" (G O L D S), which fits:
- G O L D S
- Letters: G, O, L, D, S
- All letters allowed (not in A, R, E, F, N, B)
- Structure: G O _ _ S
- No additional O's, resolving the earlier contradiction by implying the word has only one O.

Therefore, ""GOLDS"" is the next logical guess.Based on the feedback:
- G is fixed in position 1.
- O is fixed in position 2.
- S is fixed in position 5.
- There is no second O in positions 3 or 4 (the feedback from gobos showed the fourth letter O was in the wrong position, but since position 2 is already O, this implies no other O exists).

Thus, the word must be G O _ _ S with no additional O. The only valid word fitting this is ""GOLDS"".

- A, R, E (from arose)
- F (from sofos)
- N (from goons)
- B (from gobos)
- L, D (from golds)

Letters still allowed for positions 3 and 4:
Any letter not in the forbidden set {A, R, E, F, N, L, D}.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form G O _ _ S.

Possible letters for positions 3 and 4: C, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common words:
- G O C K S – ""GOCKS"" is not standard.
- G O H O S – ""GOHOS"" is not a word.
- G O K O S – ""GOKOS"" is not a word.
- G O M P S – ""GOMPS"" is not a word.
- G O M S – too short.
- G O P S – too short.
- G O T S – too short.
- G O V E S – E is ruled out.
- G O W S – too short.
- G O Z Z S – ""GOZZS"" is not a word.

The only valid word I can find is ""GOMES"" but E is ruled out. Next possibility is ""GOUPS"" but U is allowed and P is allowed. ""GOUPS"" is valid (plural of ""goup"", a type of animal).

But let me check if ""GOUPS"" fits:
- G O U P S
- Letters: G, O, U, P, S
- None of these letters are in the forbidden set.
- Structure: G O _ _ S
- This seems to fit all constraints.

Another possibility is ""GOVMS"" but that's not a word.

""GOUPS"" seems to be the only valid word left.

But wait, let me think of others:
- G O V E S – E is out.
- G O V E R – too long.
- G O V E N – N is out.
- G O V E R – too long.
- G O V E S – E is out.
- G O V E R – too long.
- G O V E R – too long.

Actually, ""GOUPS"" is the most plausible.

But let me think again: is there any other word? ""GOUPS"" seems to be the only valid word fitting G O _ _ S with allowed letters.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""GOUPS"".

- B (from gobos)
- L, D (from golds)

Letters still allowed for positions 3 and 4:
Any letter not in the forbidden set {A, R, E, F, N, L, D}.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form G O _ _ S.

Possible letters for positions 3 and 4: C, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common words:
- G O C K S – ""GOCKS"" is not standard.
- G O H O S – ""GOHOS"" is not a word.
- G O K O S – ""GOKOS"" is not a word.
- G O M P S – ""GOMPS"" is not a word.
- G O M S – too short.
- G O P S – too short.
- G O T S – too short.
- G O V E S – E is ruled out.
- G O W S – too short.
- G O Z Z S – ""GOZZS"" is not a word.

The only valid word I can find is ""GOMES"" but E is ruled out. Next possibility is ""GOUPS"" but U is allowed and P is allowed. ""GOUPS"" is valid (plural of ""goup"", a type of animal).

But let me check if ""GOUPS"" fits:
- G O U P S
- Letters: G, O, U, P, S
- None of these letters are in the forbidden set.
- Structure: G O _ _ S
- This seems to fit all constraints.

Another possibility is ""GOVMS"" but that's not a word.

""GOUPS"" seems to be the only valid word left.

But wait, let me think of others:
- G O V E S – E is out.
- G O V E R – too long.
- G O V E N – N is out.
- G O V E R – too long.
- G O V E S – E is out.
- G O V E R – too long.
- G O V E R – too long.

Actually, ""GOUPS"" is the most plausible.

But let me think again: is there any other word? ""GOUPS"" seems to be the only valid word fitting G O _ _ S with allowed letters.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""GOUPS"".",Guess 6: goups -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) O(✓) U(✓) P(x) S(✓),FAIL
