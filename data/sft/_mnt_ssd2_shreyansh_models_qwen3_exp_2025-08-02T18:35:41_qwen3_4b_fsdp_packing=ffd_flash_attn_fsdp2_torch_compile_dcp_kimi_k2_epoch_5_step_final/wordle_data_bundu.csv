### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly identify which vowels are in the word and their possible positions, as well as whether R or S are present.

From the two previous guesses we know:

- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: U and N

So the secret word contains both U and N, but not in the positions guessed above (U was first, N was second).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both U and N
2. Does not contain any of the letters A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L
3. Has U not in position 1 and N not in position 2

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: only U is confirmed; we know I and E are out, so no other vowels are available.

We need a word with U and N plus three consonants from the allowed set, arranged so that U is not first and N is not second.

One such word is “MUNGY”:
- Letters: M, U, N, G, Y
- U is in position 2 (allowed)
- N is in position 3 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters are used.

So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L, M, G, Y  
- Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:
  – U is in position 2  
  – N is in position 3  

Therefore the pattern is: _ U N _ _

We still need two more letters from the remaining pool (B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).  
We also know none of these letters can appear anywhere else in the word.

A common word that fits _ U N _ _ and uses only allowed letters is “BUNNY”.  
However, Y is already ruled out, so “BUNNY” is invalid.

Another option is “FUNNY” – again Y is banned.

“PUNY” is only four letters.

“HUNTER” is invalid (T, E, R banned).

“DUNNO” – O and N already used in wrong positions.

“BUNKY” – Y banned.

“PUNKY” – Y banned.

“PUNCH” – C and H are allowed.

“PUNCH” fits the pattern _ U N _ _ (P U N C H) and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s check: P (allowed), U (correct position), N (correct position), C (allowed), H (allowed).  
No banned letters appear, and the positions of U and N are correct.

So “PUNCH” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly identify which vowels are in the word and their possible positions, as well as whether R or S are present.

The first guess, AROSE, received all x's, which means none of its letters (A, R, O, S, E) appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates every word containing any of those five letters.  
So for the second guess, I should pick a word that avoids A, R, O, S, E entirely and still uses common letters.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U.  
A common 5-letter word that fits is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
It uses two vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L) while avoiding the banned letters.  
This should give maximum new information.

From the two previous guesses we know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: U and N

So the secret word contains both U and N, but not in the positions guessed above (U was first, N was second).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both U and N
2. Does not contain any of the letters A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L
3. Has U not in position 1 and N not in position 2

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: only U is confirmed; we know I and E are out, so no other vowels are available.

We need a word with U and N plus three consonants from the allowed set, arranged so that U is not first and N is not second.

One such word is “MUNGY”:
- Letters: M, U, N, G, Y
- U is in position 2 (allowed)
- N is in position 3 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters are used.

Let’s go with MUNGY.

We still need two more letters from the remaining pool (B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).  
We also know none of these letters can appear anywhere else in the word.

A common word that fits _ U N _ _ and uses only allowed letters is “BUNNY”.  
However, Y is already ruled out, so “BUNNY” is invalid.

Another option is “FUNNY” – again Y is banned.

“PUNY” is only four letters.

“HUNTER” is invalid (T, E, R banned).

“DUNNO” – O and N already used in wrong positions.

“BUNKY” – Y banned.

“PUNKY” – Y banned.

“PUNCH” – C and H are allowed.

“PUNCH” fits the pattern _ U N _ _ (P U N C H) and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s check: P (allowed), U (correct position), N (correct position), C (allowed), H (allowed).  
No banned letters appear, and the positions of U and N are correct.

So “PUNCH” is a valid next guess.

From all feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L, M, G, Y, P, C, H  
- Correct positions:  
  – Position 2 = U  
  – Position 3 = N  

So the pattern is: _ U N _ _

Remaining unused letters (still allowed): B, D, F, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters to fill positions 1 and 5, chosen from the allowed set.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly identify which vowels are in the word and their possible positions, as well as whether R or S are present.

The first guess, AROSE, received all x's, which means none of its letters (A, R, O, S, E) appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates every word containing any of those five letters.  
So for the second guess, I should pick a word that avoids A, R, O, S, E entirely and still uses common letters.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U.  
A common 5-letter word that fits is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
It uses two vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L) while avoiding the banned letters.  
This should give maximum new information.

Guess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) T(x) I(x) L(x)

From the two previous guesses we know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: U and N

So the secret word contains both U and N, but not in the positions guessed above (U was first, N was second).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both U and N
2. Does not contain any of the letters A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L
3. Has U not in position 1 and N not in position 2

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: only U is confirmed; we know I and E are out, so no other vowels are available.

We need a word with U and N plus three consonants from the allowed set, arranged so that U is not first and N is not second.

One such word is “MUNGY”:
- Letters: M, U, N, G, Y
- U is in position 2 (allowed)
- N is in position 3 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters are used.

Let’s go with MUNGY.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) T(x) I(x) L(x)
Guess 3: mungy -> FEEDBACK: M(x) U(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L, M, G, Y  
- Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:
  – U is in position 2  
  – N is in position 3  

Therefore the pattern is: _ U N _ _

We still need two more letters from the remaining pool (B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).  
We also know none of these letters can appear anywhere else in the word.

A common word that fits _ U N _ _ and uses only allowed letters is “BUNNY”.  
However, Y is already ruled out, so “BUNNY” is invalid.

Another option is “FUNNY” – again Y is banned.

“PUNY” is only four letters.

“HUNTER” is invalid (T, E, R banned).

“DUNNO” – O and N already used in wrong positions.

“BUNKY” – Y banned.

“PUNKY” – Y banned.

“PUNCH” – C and H are allowed.

“PUNCH” fits the pattern _ U N _ _ (P U N C H) and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s check: P (allowed), U (correct position), N (correct position), C (allowed), H (allowed).  
No banned letters appear, and the positions of U and N are correct.

So “PUNCH” is a valid next guess.

So far we know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L, M, G, Y, P, C, H  
- Correct positions: U in position 2, N in position 3  
- Pattern: _ U N _ _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z  
We need two more letters from this set to fill positions 1 and 4 or 5.

Looking for common English 5-letter words that fit _ U N _ _ and use only allowed letters:

- BUNNY – Y is banned  
- FUNNY – Y is banned  
- DUNNO – O and N already ruled out  
- JUNKY – Y is banned  
- BUNKY – Y is banned  
- PUNKY – P, Y, K already ruled out  
- DUNKY – Y is banned  
- BUNGE – E is banned  
- BUNNY – already ruled out  
- BUNKS – S is banned  

Scanning the allowed letters, the only common word that fits is “BUNNY” but Y is banned.  
Next possibility: “FUNNY” – Y banned.  
Next: “DUNNO” – O banned.  
Next: “JUNKY” – Y banned.  
Next: “BUNKY” – Y banned.  
Next: “PUNKY” – P, Y, K banned.  
Next: “DUNKY” – Y banned.  
Next: “BUNGE” – E banned.  
Next: “BUNNY” – already ruled out.  

Wait, let’s list every possible combination of allowed letters for _ U N _ _:

Allowed letters: B, D, F, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Positions 1,4,5 must be filled with these letters, no repeats unless allowed.

Possible words:

- BUN _ _: B U N _ _

  – BUNBF – invalid  
  – BUNBZ – invalid  
  – BUNBK – invalid  
  – BUNBJ – invalid
