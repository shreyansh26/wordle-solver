For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five of these common letters and can give me good information about multiple letters at once. 

""AROSE"" contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should help me quickly narrow down which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all

So we know:
1. The word contains A and O, but not R, S, or E.
2. A is not in position 1, and O is not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and O
- Does not contain R, S, or E
- Places A somewhere other than position 1
- Places O somewhere other than position 3

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. Some possibilities:
- ""COBIA"" – but it has an E (no, wait, that's C-O-B-I-A, no E), but it has I and B which might be okay. But let's check: C-O-B-I-A – contains A and O, no R/S/E, A is in position 5 (allowed), O is in position 2 (allowed). This looks valid.
- ""ADOPT"" – but it has P and T, and contains O in position 3 which is forbidden.
- ""PAINT"" – no O, so invalid.
- ""CLOAK"" – has K, but O is in position 3 which is forbidden.
- ""PLAID"" – has D and I, but O is not present, so invalid.
- ""COBIA"" seems valid as above.

Another candidate: ""AUDIO"" – but it has U and D, and O is in position 4 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed). It also avoids R/S/E. This looks good.

Between COBIA and AUDIO, both are valid, but AUDIO uses more common letters (U is common, D is okay). Let's go with AUDIO.

Wait, let me double-check:
AUDIO:
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- O is in position 4 (allowed)
- Contains A and O
- Does not contain R, S, or E
- All letters are valid

This seems like the best next guess.

- R(x) → R is not in the word at all
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all

So we know:
1. The word contains A and O, but not R, S, or E.
2. A is not in position 1, and O is not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and O
- Does not contain R, S, or E
- Places A somewhere other than position 1
- Places O somewhere other than position 3

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. Some possibilities:
- ""COBIA"" – but it has an E (no, wait, that's C-O-B-I-A, no E), but it has I and B which might be okay. But let's check: C-O-B-I-A – contains A and O, no R/S/E, A is in position 5 (allowed), O is in position 2 (allowed). This looks valid.
- ""ADOPT"" – but it has P and T, and contains O in position 3 which is forbidden.
- ""PAINT"" – no O, so invalid.
- ""CLOAK"" – has K, but O is in position 3 which is forbidden.
- ""PLAID"" – has D and I, but O is not present, so invalid.
- ""COBIA"" seems valid as above.

Another candidate: ""AUDIO"" – but it has U and D, and O is in position 4 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed). It also avoids R/S/E. This looks good.

Between COBIA and AUDIO, both are valid, but AUDIO uses more common letters (U is common, D is okay). Let's go with AUDIO.

Wait, let me double-check:
AUDIO:
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- O is in position 4 (allowed)
- Contains A and O
- Does not contain R, S, or E
- All letters are valid

This seems like the best next guess.

From the new feedback on ""audio"":

- U(x) → U is not in the word
- D(x) → D is not in the word
- I(x) → I is not in the word
- O(✓) → O is in the word and is in position 5 (correct spot)

So we now know:
1. The word ends with O (position 5).
2. It contains A somewhere (but not position 1, and not yet placed).
3. It does NOT contain R, S, E, U, D, I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with O
- Has an A in positions 2, 3, or 4
- Uses only remaining letters (no R, S, E, U, D, I)

Remaining common letters to try: N, T, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, Y, etc.

Let's brainstorm words ending in O with A in positions 2-4:
- ANCHO – but has H and C, and A is in position 1 (invalid)
- CHAOS – but has S (invalid)
- CLOAK – has K and C, A is in position 3 (valid positions), ends with K (invalid)
- COBIA – ends with A (invalid)
- GLOAM – ends with M (invalid)
- PLANK – ends with K (invalid)
- PLANT – ends with T (invalid)
- CHART – ends with T (invalid)
- CLANG – ends with G (invalid)
- PLANT – ends with T (invalid)
- COBALT – too long
- CAMPO – ends with O, A in position 2 (valid), letters C, M, P, O – all allowed
- CAMPO: C A M P O
   - Ends with O (✓)
   - A is in position 2 (allowed)
   - No forbidden letters (R, S, E, U, D, I)
   - All letters are valid
- Another candidate: CAMPO

Let me check if there are better options:
- AMBRO – but has B and R (invalid)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five of these common letters and can give me good information about multiple letters at once. 

""AROSE"" contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should help me quickly narrow down which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five of these common letters and can give me good information about multiple letters at once. 

""AROSE"" contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should help me quickly narrow down which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all

So we know:
1. The word contains A and O, but not R, S, or E.
2. A is not in position 1, and O is not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and O
- Does not contain R, S, or E
- Places A somewhere other than position 1
- Places O somewhere other than position 3

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. Some possibilities:
- ""COBIA"" – but it has an E (no, wait, that's C-O-B-I-A, no E), but it has I and B which might be okay. But let's check: C-O-B-I-A – contains A and O, no R/S/E, A is in position 5 (allowed), O is in position 2 (allowed). This looks valid.
- ""ADOPT"" – but it has P and T, and contains O in position 3 which is forbidden.
- ""PAINT"" – no O, so invalid.
- ""CLOAK"" – has K, but O is in position 3 which is forbidden.
- ""PLAID"" – has D and I, but O is not present, so invalid.
- ""COBIA"" seems valid as above.

Another candidate: ""AUDIO"" – but it has U and D, and O is in position 4 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed). It also avoids R/S/E. This looks good.

Between COBIA and AUDIO, both are valid, but AUDIO uses more common letters (U is common, D is okay). Let's go with AUDIO.

Wait, let me double-check:
AUDIO:
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- O is in position 4 (allowed)
- Contains A and O
- Does not contain R, S, or E
- All letters are valid

This seems like the best next guess.

From the new feedback on ""audio"":
- A(-) → A is still in the word but NOT in position 1 (confirmed again)
- U(x) → U is not in the word
- D(x) → D is not in the word
- I(x) → I is not in the word
- O(✓) → O is in the word and is in position 5 (correct spot)

So we now know:
1. The word ends with O (position 5).
2. It contains A somewhere (but not position 1, and not yet placed).
3. It does NOT contain R, S, E, U, D, I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with O
- Has an A in positions 2, 3, or 4
- Uses only remaining letters (no R, S, E, U, D, I)

Remaining common letters to try: N, T, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, Y, etc.

Let's brainstorm words ending in O with A in positions 2-4:
- ANCHO – but has H and C, and A is in position 1 (invalid)
- CHAOS – but has S (invalid)
- CLOAK – has K and C, A is in position 3 (valid positions), ends with K (invalid)
- COBIA – ends with A (invalid)
- GLOAM – ends with M (invalid)
- PLANK – ends with K (invalid)
- PLANT – ends with T (invalid)
- CHART – ends with T (invalid)
- CLANG – ends with G (invalid)
- PLANT – ends with T (invalid)
- COBALT – too long
- CAMPO – ends with O, A in position 2 (valid), letters C, M, P, O – all allowed
- CAMPO: C A M P O
   - Ends with O (✓)
   - A is in position 2 (allowed)
   - No forbidden letters (R, S, E, U, D, I)
   - All letters are valid
- Another candidate: CAMPO

Let me check if there are better options:
- AMBRO – but has B and R (invalid)
- AMMON – ends with N (invalid)
- CAMPO seems best

From the latest feedback on ""campo"":

- M(x) → M is not in the word

- O(✓) → O is in the word and is in position 5 (correct spot)

So we now know:
1. Word structure: _ A _ _ O
2. Letters not in the word: R, S, E, U, D, I, C, M
3. P is somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not 4, so 1 or 3)

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z plus P.

We need a 5-letter word fitting _ A _ _ O with P somewhere in 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- P A _ _ O (but P is not in position 1, since feedback says P is in word but not in position 4, but doesn't say it's not in position 1)
- _ A P _ O
- _ A _ P O (but P is not in position 4, so this is invalid)

Wait, feedback says P is in the word but wrong position (currently position 4), so P must be in position 1 or 3.

Let's consider:
- P A _ _ O: Need two more letters in positions 3 and 4, not forbidden. Possible: P A B L O (but L is allowed, B is allowed) – ""PABLO"" is a valid word.
- _ A P _ O: Need letters in positions 1 and 4. Possible: B A P _ O – ""BAPPO"" is invalid. F A P _ O – ""FAPPO"" invalid. L A P _ O – ""LAPPO"" invalid. T A P _ O – ""TAPPO"" invalid.

Y A P _ O – ""YAPPO"" invalid. Z A P _ O – ""ZAPPO"" invalid.

Looking at P A _ _ O: ""PABLO"" is valid and fits.
""PABLO"" uses P, A, B, L, O. All letters are allowed (not in forbidden list), and positions:
- P in position 1 (allowed, since P is in word but not in position 4)
- A in position 2 (matches ✓)
- B in position 3 (allowed)
- L in position 4 (allowed)
- O in position 5 (matches ✓)

This seems correct.Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 2
- O is confirmed in position 5
- P is in the word but not in position 4
- Forbidden letters: R, S, E, U, D, I, C, M

The word must be _ A _ _ O with P in position 1 or 3. The only valid word fitting these constraints is PABLO.

A word like ""AROSE"" uses five of these common letters and can give me good information about multiple letters at once. \n\n""AROSE"" contains:\n- A (very common vowel)\n- R (common consonant)\n- O (common vowel)\n- S (common consonant)\n- E (most common letter in English)\n\nThis should help me quickly narrow down which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on ""arose"":\n- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1\n- R(x) → R is not in the word at all\n- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3\n- S(x) → S is not in the word at all\n- E(x) → E is not in the word at all\n\nSo we know:\n1.

It also avoids R/S/E. This looks good.\n\nBetween COBIA and AUDIO, both are valid, but AUDIO uses more common letters (U is common, D is okay). Let\'s go with AUDIO.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\nAUDIO:\n- A is in position 2 (allowed)\n- O is in position 4 (allowed)\n- Contains A and O\n- Does not contain R, S, or E\n- All letters are valid\n\nThis seems like the best next guess.\n\n<guess>audio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on ""audio"":\n- A(-) → A is still in the word but NOT in position 1 (confirmed again)\n- U(x) → U is not in the word\n- D(x) → D is not in the word\n- I(x) → I is not in the word\n- O(✓) → O is in the word and is in position 5 (correct spot)\n\nSo we now know:\n1.
