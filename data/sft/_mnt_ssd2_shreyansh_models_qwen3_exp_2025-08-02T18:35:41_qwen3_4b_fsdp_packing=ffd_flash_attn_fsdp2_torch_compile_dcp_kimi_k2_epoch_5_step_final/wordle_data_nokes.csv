For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like S, T, R, N, L. A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to work with and should provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 1).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 5).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes S and E (but S not in position 1, E not in position 5).
- Does NOT include L, A, T.

Good consonants to try next are R, N, C, D, M, P, etc. Good vowels are I, O, U (since A is out). Let’s try a word that places S in a different spot and E in a different spot, while introducing new common letters.

A strong candidate is “SERFS”:
- S is now in position 2 (not 1).
- E is now in position 1 (not 5).
- R and F are new letters we haven’t tested yet.
- No L, A, T appear.

This seems like a good next guess to narrow down possibilities.

Let’s consolidate the information we have so far.

- E (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 5)

- Keeps S in position 3
- Introduces new letters like N, D, and possibly O or I

A good candidate is “ENSEN”:

- N in positions 1, 4, 5
- Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out yet

This should help us determine if N is in the word and potentially place E correctly.

Let’s update what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters confirmed in the word:

- E must be in position 4 (from ENSEN feedback: fourth letter E is ✓)

Letters known NOT in the word:

So the word pattern is: _ _ S E _

We still need to determine the first and second letters.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We want a word that:
- Has S in position 3 and E in position 4
- Uses only allowed letters
- Uses common consonants and vowels to maximize information

Candidate words:
- “HOMES” – but H is allowed, O is allowed, M is allowed, but this uses M and H, and we haven’t tested M yet.
- “COMES” – C and O are allowed, M is allowed.
- “DOSES” – D and O are allowed, S is already known.
- “POSSE” – P and O are allowed, but double S is possible, but we already know S is in position 3.

“COMES” seems good: C and O are new letters to test, and M is new too. It fits the pattern _ _ S E _.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like S, T, R, N, L. A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to work with and should provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 1).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 5).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes S and E (but S not in position 1, E not in position 5).
- Does NOT include L, A, T.

Good consonants to try next are R, N, C, D, M, P, etc. Good vowels are I, O, U (since A is out). Let’s try a word that places S in a different spot and E in a different spot, while introducing new common letters.

A strong candidate is “SERFS”:
- S is now in position 2 (not 1).
- E is now in position 1 (not 5).
- R and F are new letters we haven’t tested yet.
- No L, A, T appear.

This seems like a good next guess to narrow down possibilities.

Let’s consolidate the information we have so far.

Letters we know are in the word:
- S (must be in position 3, because in SERFS the third S got ✓)
- E (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 5)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- L, A, T, R, F

So the word looks like: _ _ S _ _ with E somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4. But position 3 is already S, so E must be in position 2 or 4.

We need to test new common consonants and vowels. Good candidates to try next are N, D, C, M, P, G, B, H, etc. and the remaining vowels O, I, U.

Let’s try a word that:
- Places E in position 2 (since position 4 is still open)
- Keeps S in position 3
- Introduces new letters like N, D, and possibly O or I

A good candidate is “ENSEN”:
- E in position 2
- S in position 3
- N in positions 1, 4, 5
- Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out yet

This should help us determine if N is in the word and potentially place E correctly.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like S, T, R, N, L. A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to work with and should provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 1).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 5).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes S and E (but S not in position 1, E not in position 5).
- Does NOT include L, A, T.

Good consonants to try next are R, N, C, D, M, P, etc. Good vowels are I, O, U (since A is out). Let’s try a word that places S in a different spot and E in a different spot, while introducing new common letters.

A strong candidate is “SERFS”:
- S is now in position 2 (not 1).
- E is now in position 1 (not 5).
- R and F are new letters we haven’t tested yet.
- No L, A, T appear.

This seems like a good next guess to narrow down possibilities.

Let’s consolidate the information we have so far.

Letters we know are in the word:
- S (must be in position 3, because in SERFS the third S got ✓)
- E (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 5)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- L, A, T, R, F

So the word looks like: _ _ S _ _ with E somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4. But position 3 is already S, so E must be in position 2 or 4.

We need to test new common consonants and vowels. Good candidates to try next are N, D, C, M, P, G, B, H, etc. and the remaining vowels O, I, U.

Let’s try a word that:
- Places E in position 2 (since position 4 is still open)
- Keeps S in position 3
- Introduces new letters like N, D, and possibly O or I

A good candidate is “ENSEN”:
- E in position 2
- S in position 3
- N in positions 1, 4, 5
- Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out yet

This should help us determine if N is in the word and potentially place E correctly.

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We want a word that:
- Has S in position 3 and E in position 4
- Uses only allowed letters
- Uses common consonants and vowels to maximize information

Candidate words:
- “HOMES” – but H is allowed, O is allowed, M is allowed, but this uses M and H, and we haven’t tested M yet.
- “COMES” – C and O are allowed, M is allowed.
- “DOSES” – D and O are allowed, S is already known.
- “POSSE” – P and O are allowed, but double S is possible, but we already know S is in position 3.

“COMES” seems good: C and O are new letters to test, and M is new too. It fits the pattern _ _ S E _.

Let’s go with COMES.

Current confirmed information:

1. Pattern so far: _ O S E S  (positions 2,4,5 are O, E, S respectively)
   - Position 2 must be O (from COMES feedback: second letter O is ✓)
   - Position 4 must be E (from ENSEN feedback: fourth letter E is ✓)
   - Position 5 must be S (from SERFS feedback: fifth letter S is ✓)

2. Letters not in the word at all:
   L, A, T, R, F, N, C, M

3. Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
   B, D, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

4. Position 1 is the only remaining unknown letter.
   It must be one of the allowed letters listed above.

5. Common 5-letter words that fit the pattern ? O S E S:
   - BOSSE
   - DOSER  (but R is ruled out)
   - GOSSE
   - HOSER  (R is ruled out)
   - JOSER  (J not yet tested, but not common)
   - POSER  (R is ruled out)
   - WOSER  (R is ruled out)

   The only common word left is BOSSE or GOSSE. Between these, BOSSE is more common.

6. Check if B is allowed: Yes, B has not been tested yet and is not in the ruled-out list.

So the most logical next guess is BOSSE.

Let’s update the state after the fifth guess.

Known facts:

1. Pattern: _ O _ _ _   (position 2 is O)
2. Letters that must appear:
   - S appears at least once (from earlier feedback)
   - E appears at least once (from earlier feedback)
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   L, A, T, R, F, N, C, M, B
4. Letters already placed:
   - Position 2 = O
   - Position 5 = E  (from ENSEN feedback: fourth letter E is ✓, but in BOSSE the fifth letter E got “-”, so E cannot be in position 5. This implies the earlier interpretation was wrong. Let’s re-examine.)

Wait, let’s re-express the feedback carefully:

From Guess 3 (ENSEN → E(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) N(-)):
- Position 4 E is ✓ → E is in position 4.
- Position 5 N is -, so E is not in position 5.

From Guess 4 (COMES → C(x) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) S(✓)):
- Position 2 O is ✓ → O is in position 2.
- Position 4 E is ✓ → E is in position 4.
- Position 5 S is ✓ → S is in position 5.

From Guess 5 (BOSSE → B(x) O(✓) S(-) S(-) E(-)):
- Position 2 O is ✓ (confirmed)
- Position 5 E is -, so E is not in position 5 (consistent)
- Position 3 S is -, so S is not in position 3
- Position 4 S is -, so S is not in position 4

But earlier we had from COMES that S is in position 5 (✓). So the pattern is now:

_ O _ _ S

with E somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4, but:
- position 4 is already E (from ENSEN)
- position 3 cannot be E (because position 4 is E and no two Es are likely)
- position 1 could be E

But position 4 is E, and position 5 is S, so the word must be:

E O _ E S

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in E S:
- E O _ E S
Possible: E O G E S (but G is allowed), E O D E S (but D is allowed), etc.

Check which letters are allowed:
Allowed letters (not in ruled-out list): D, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Common word: E O G E S → EOGES (not a valid word)
E O D E S → EODES (not valid)
E O P E S → EOPES (not valid)
E O W E S → EOWES (not valid)
E O K E S → EOKES (not valid)

Wait, let’s think differently. The pattern is _ O _ _ S with E in position 4, so:

_ O _ E S

Looking for valid words:
- DOGES
- HOSES
- JONES (but N is ruled out)
- POSSE (but S is already in position 5, double S possible, but P is allowed, O is position 2, S is position 5)

Check which fit:
- DOGES: D, O, G, E, S → all letters allowed (D, G not ruled out), and fits _ O _ E S.

Let’s verify:
D(?) O(✓) G(?) E(✓) S(✓)

All letters are allowed (D and G not in the banned list). DOGES is a valid word.

So the next guess is DOGES.
