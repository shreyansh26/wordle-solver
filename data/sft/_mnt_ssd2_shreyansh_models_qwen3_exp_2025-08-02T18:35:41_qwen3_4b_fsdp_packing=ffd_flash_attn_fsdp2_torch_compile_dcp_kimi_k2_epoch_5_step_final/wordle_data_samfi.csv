For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions quickly.
2. It has common consonants (R, S) that appear in many 5-letter words.
3. It's a valid English word.

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.

- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word:

- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep A and S in new positions.
2. Avoid R, O, E.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.

Good candidates: “STAND”, “PLANS”, “SALAD”, “SHANT”, “PAINT”.

“STAND” looks good because:

- A is now in position 2 (allowed since it was only ruled out of position 1).
- Introduces T, N, D which are common letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. stand → S(✓) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓) — so S is locked in place.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (because in stand it was in position 3 and got (-)).
   - T, N, D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- It contains A, but A is not in position 1 or 3.
- It does NOT contain R, O, E, T, N, D.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Has an A in position 2 or 4 or 5 (but not 1 or 3).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Letters still possible: A, B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S (already used).

Let’s try to find a word that fits these constraints. Some possibilities:
- S _ A _ _ (A in position 3 is ruled out, so this is invalid).
- S _ _ A _ (A in position 4).
- S _ _ _ A (A in position 5).

Possible words:
- S _ _ A _ : ""SHACK"" (H, C, K allowed), but H, C, K are allowed.
- S _ _ _ A : ""SPOOK"" (O is ruled out), ""SMITH"" (T is ruled out), ""SWAMP"" (T, N, D are ruled out), ""SKIMP"" (T, N, D are ruled out), ""SKANK"" (N, D are ruled out), ""SHARK"" (R is ruled out), ""SKATE"" (T, E are ruled out), ""SKIMP"" (T is ruled out), ""SKANK"" (N is ruled out), ""SKULK"" (U, L, K allowed), ""SKULK"" seems possible.

""SKULK"" fits:
- Starts with S.
- A is not in position 1 or 3 (it's not in the word, but we need to check if it's in position 2,4,5. Actually, ""SKULK"" has no A, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that A is in the word. So this is invalid.)

Wait, we know A is in the word, so the word must contain A. Let me re-examine.

We need a word starting with S, containing A (not in position 1 or 3), and avoiding R, O, E, T, N, D.

Possible words:
- S _ A _ _ : A in position 3 is invalid (ruled out by stand feedback).
- S _ _ A _ : A in position 4.
- S _ _ _ A : A in position 5.

Let me think of words:
- S _ _ A _ : ""SHACK"" (H, C, K allowed), but does it have A? Yes, position 4.
- S _ _ _ A : ""SPANK"" (P, N, K; N is ruled out), ""SWANK"" (W, N, K; N is ruled out), ""SKANK"" (K, N is ruled out), ""SPOOK"" (O is ruled out), ""SILKY"" (L, K, Y allowed), but does it have A? No, it has I, L, K, Y. So this is invalid.

""SHACK"" has H, A, C, K. It starts with S, has A in position 4, and uses allowed letters (H, C, K not ruled out). This seems valid.

Another option: ""SLASH"" (L, A, S, H). Starts with S, has A in position 2 (allowed), but S is already in position 1, and we don't know if S appears more than once. However, we have no info against it.

Between ""SHACK"" and ""SLASH"", ""SLASH"" seems better because:
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since only positions 1 and 3 were ruled out for A).
- Uses L and H, which are not ruled out.

So I'll go with ""SLASH"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions quickly.
2. It has common consonants (R, S) that appear in many 5-letter words.
3. It's a valid English word.

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: stand -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. stand → S(✓) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓) — so S is locked in place.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (because in stand it was in position 3 and got (-)).
   - T, N, D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- It contains A, but A is not in position 1 or 3.
- It does NOT contain R, O, E, T, N, D.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Has an A in position 2 or 4 or 5 (but not 1 or 3).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Letters still possible: A, B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S (already used).

Let’s try to find a word that fits these constraints. Some possibilities:
- S _ A _ _ (A in position 3 is ruled out, so this is invalid).
- S _ _ A _ (A in position 4).
- S _ _ _ A (A in position 5).

Possible words:
- S _ _ A _ : ""SHACK"" (H, C, K allowed), but H, C, K are allowed.
- S _ _ _ A : ""SPOOK"" (O is ruled out), ""SMITH"" (T is ruled out), ""SWAMP"" (T, N, D are ruled out), ""SKIMP"" (T, N, D are ruled out), ""SKANK"" (N, D are ruled out), ""SHARK"" (R is ruled out), ""SKATE"" (T, E are ruled out), ""SKIMP"" (T is ruled out), ""SKANK"" (N is ruled out), ""SKULK"" (U, L, K allowed), ""SKULK"" seems possible.

""SKULK"" fits:
- Starts with S.
- A is not in position 1 or 3 (it's not in the word, but we need to check if it's in position 2,4,5. Actually, ""SKULK"" has no A, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that A is in the word. So this is invalid.)

Wait, we know A is in the word, so the word must contain A. Let me re-examine.

We need a word starting with S, containing A (not in position 1 or 3), and avoiding R, O, E, T, N, D.

Possible words:
- S _ A _ _ : A in position 3 is invalid (ruled out by stand feedback).
- S _ _ A _ : A in position 4.
- S _ _ _ A : A in position 5.

Let me think of words:
- S _ _ A _ : ""SHACK"" (H, C, K allowed), but does it have A? Yes, position 4.
- S _ _ _ A : ""SPANK"" (P, N, K; N is ruled out), ""SWANK"" (W, N, K; N is ruled out), ""SKANK"" (K, N is ruled out), ""SPOOK"" (O is ruled out), ""SILKY"" (L, K, Y allowed), but does it have A? No, it has I, L, K, Y. So this is invalid.

""SHACK"" has H, A, C, K. It starts with S, has A in position 4, and uses allowed letters (H, C, K not ruled out). This seems valid.

Another option: ""SLASH"" (L, A, S, H). Starts with S, has A in position 2 (allowed), but S is already in position 1, and we don't know if S appears more than once. However, we have no info against it.

Between ""SHACK"" and ""SLASH"", ""SLASH"" seems better because:
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since only positions 1 and 3 were ruled out for A).
- Uses L and H, which are not ruled out.

So I'll go with ""SLASH"".

Let's consolidate everything we now know.

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. stand → S(✓) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is locked in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - T, N, D are not in the word.

3. slash → S(✓) L(x) A(-) S(-) H(x)
   - S is confirmed in position 1.
   - L and H are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already known) and not in position 4 (because in slash it was in position 4 and got (-)).
   - The second S in position 4 is invalid (got (-)), so the word can't have two S's.

So far:
- Word starts with S.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 4. Therefore A must be in position 2 or 5.
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, T, N, D, L, H.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A in position 2 or 5.
- Uses only letters not ruled out.

Possible patterns:
- S A _ _ _ (A in position 2)
- S _ _ _ A (A in position 5)

Letters still allowed: A, B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus S already used).

Let's explore each pattern.

Pattern 1: S A _ _ _
   Need three more letters from the allowed set, avoiding duplicates of already ruled-out letters.
   Possible words: ""SABIN"" (but N is ruled out), ""SAGGY"" (G, Y allowed), ""SAUCY"" (U, C, Y allowed), ""SAVOR"" (O is ruled out), ""SAXON"" (O, N ruled out), ""SAPID"" (P, I, D; D ruled out), ""SAVY"" is 4 letters, ""SALSA"" (L ruled out), ""SABER"" (E, R ruled out), ""SAINT"" (T ruled out), ""SAUCY"" seems valid.

Pattern 2: S _ _ _ A
   Need four letters from allowed set.
   Possible words: ""SMITH"" (T, H ruled out), ""SKUNK"" (K, U, N; N ruled out), ""SWAMP"" (T, N, P, M; T, N ruled out), ""SPANK"" (N ruled out), ""SKANK"" (N ruled out), ""SPOOK"" (O ruled out), ""SILKY"" (L ruled out), ""SKULK"" (L ruled out), ""SULKY"" (L ruled out), ""SULKY"" invalid, ""SULKY"" invalid, ""SULKY"" invalid... it seems hard to find valid words here.

Between the two patterns, Pattern 1 gives us more options. ""SAUCY"" seems like a good candidate:
- Starts with S.
- A in position 2.
- Uses C, U, Y which are allowed.
- No ruled-out letters.

Let me check if there are any other better options. ""SAUCY"" seems the most straightforward.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions quickly.
2. It has common consonants (R, S) that appear in many 5-letter words.
3. It's a valid English word.

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.

- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S somewhere, but A is not first and S is not fourth.
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep A and S in new positions.
2. Avoid R, O, E.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.

Good candidates: “STAND”, “PLANS”, “SALAD”, “SHANT”, “PAINT”.

“STAND” looks good because:
- S is now in position 1 (allowed since it was only ruled out of position 4).
- A is now in position 2 (allowed since it was only ruled out of position 1).
- Introduces T, N, D which are common letters.
- No R, O, E.

   Possible words: ""SABIN"" (but N is ruled out), ""SAGGY"" (G, Y allowed), ""SAUCY"" (U, C, Y allowed), ""SAVOR"" (O is ruled out), ""SAXON"" (O, N ruled out), ""SAPID"" (P, I, D; D ruled out), ""SAVY"" is 4 letters, ""SALSA"" (L ruled out), ""SABER"" (E, R ruled out), ""SAINT"" (T ruled out), ""SAUCY"" seems valid.

Pattern 2: S _ _ _ A
   Need four letters from allowed set.
   Possible words: ""SMITH"" (T, H ruled out), ""SKUNK"" (K, U, N; N ruled out), ""SWAMP"" (T, N, P, M; T, N ruled out), ""SPANK"" (N ruled out), ""SKANK"" (N ruled out), ""SPOOK"" (O ruled out), ""SILKY"" (L ruled out), ""SKULK"" (L ruled out), ""SULKY"" (L ruled out), ""SULKY"" invalid, ""SULKY"" invalid, ""SULKY"" invalid... it seems hard to find valid words here.

Between the two patterns, Pattern 1 gives us more options. ""SAUCY"" seems like a good candidate:
- Starts with S.
- A in position 2.
- Uses C, U, Y which are allowed.
- No ruled-out letters.

Let me check if there are any other better options. ""SAUCY"" seems the most straightforward.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions quickly.
2. It has common consonants (R, S) that appear in many 5-letter words.
3. It's a valid English word.

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S somewhere, but A is not first and S is not fourth.
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep A and S in new positions.
2. Avoid R, O, E.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.

Good candidates: “STAND”, “PLANS”, “SALAD”, “SHANT”, “PAINT”.

“STAND” looks good because:
- S is now in position 1 (allowed since it was only ruled out of position 4).
- A is now in position 2 (allowed since it was only ruled out of position 1).
- Introduces T, N, D which are common letters.
- No R, O, E.

Guess 2: stand -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. stand → S(✓) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓) — so S is locked in place.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (because in stand it was in position 3 and got (-)).
   - T, N, D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- It contains A, but A is not in position 1 or 3.
- It does NOT contain R, O, E, T, N, D.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Has an A in position 2 or 4 or 5 (but not 1 or 3).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Letters still possible: A, B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S (already used).

Let’s try to find a word that fits these constraints. Some possibilities:
- S _ A _ _ (A in position 3 is ruled out, so this is invalid).
- S _ _ A _ (A in position 4).
- S _ _ _ A (A in position 5).

Possible words:
- S _ _ A _ : ""SHACK"" (H, C, K allowed), but H, C, K are allowed.
- S _ _ _ A : ""SPOOK"" (O is ruled out), ""SMITH"" (T is ruled out), ""SWAMP"" (T, N, D are ruled out), ""SKIMP"" (T, N, D are ruled out), ""SKANK"" (N, D are ruled out), ""SHARK"" (R is ruled out), ""SKATE"" (T, E are ruled out), ""SKIMP"" (T is ruled out), ""SKANK"" (N is ruled out), ""SKULK"" (U, L, K allowed), ""SKULK"" seems possible.

""SKULK"" fits:
- Starts with S.
- A is not in position 1 or 3 (it's not in the word, but we need to check if it's in position 2,4,5. Actually, ""SKULK"" has no A, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that A is in the word. So this is invalid.)

Wait, we know A is in the word, so the word must contain A. Let me re-examine.

We need a word starting with S, containing A (not in position 1 or 3), and avoiding R, O, E, T, N, D.

Possible words:
- S _ A _ _ : A in position 3 is invalid (ruled out by stand feedback).
- S _ _ A _ : A in position 4.
- S _ _ _ A : A in position 5.

Let me think of words:
- S _ _ A _ : ""SHACK"" (H, C, K allowed), but does it have A? Yes, position 4.
- S _ _ _ A : ""SPANK"" (P, N, K; N is ruled out), ""SWANK"" (W, N, K; N is ruled out), ""SKANK"" (K, N is ruled out), ""SPOOK"" (O is ruled out), ""SILKY"" (L, K, Y allowed), but does it have A? No, it has I, L, K, Y. So this is invalid.

""SHACK"" has H, A, C, K. It starts with S, has A in position 4, and uses allowed letters (H, C, K not ruled out). This seems valid.

Another option: ""SLASH"" (L, A, S, H). Starts with S, has A in position 2 (allowed), but S is already in position 1, and we don't know if S appears more than once. However, we have no info against it.

Between ""SHACK"" and ""SLASH"", ""SLASH"" seems better because:
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since only positions 1 and 3 were ruled out for A).
- Uses L and H, which are not ruled out.

So I'll go with ""SLASH"".

Let's consolidate everything we now know.

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. stand → S(✓) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is locked in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - T, N, D are not in the word.

3. slash → S(✓) L(x) A(-) S(-) H(x)
   - S is confirmed in position 1.
   - L and H are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already known) and not in position 4 (because in slash it was in position 4 and got (-)).
   - The second S in position 4 is invalid (got (-)), so the word can't have two S's.

So far:
- Word starts with S.
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 4. Therefore A must be in position 2 or 5.
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, T, N, D, L, H.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A in position 2 or 5.
- Uses only letters not ruled out.

Possible patterns:
- S A _ _ _ (A in position 2)
- S _ _ _ A (A in position 5)

Letters still allowed: A, B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus S already used).

Let's explore each pattern.

Pattern 1: S A _ _ _
   Need three more letters from the allowed set, avoiding duplicates of already ruled-out letters.
   Possible words: ""SABIN"" (but N is ruled out), ""SAGGY"" (G, Y allowed), ""SAUCY"" (U, C, Y allowed), ""SAVOR"" (O is ruled out), ""SAXON"" (O, N ruled out), ""SAPID"" (P, I, D; D ruled out), ""SAVY"" is 4 letters, ""SALSA"" (L ruled out), ""SABER"" (E, R ruled out), ""SAINT"" (T ruled out), ""SAUCY"" seems valid.

Pattern 2: S _ _ _ A
   Need four letters from allowed set.
   Possible words: ""SMITH"" (T, H ruled out), ""SKUNK"" (K, U, N; N ruled out), ""SWAMP"" (T, N, P, M; T, N ruled out), ""SPANK"" (N ruled out), ""SKANK"" (N ruled out), ""SPOOK"" (O ruled out), ""SILKY"" (L ruled out), ""SKULK"" (L ruled out), ""SULKY"" (L ruled out), ""SULKY"" invalid, ""SULKY"" invalid, ""SULKY"" invalid... it seems hard to find valid words here.

Between the two patterns, Pattern 1 gives us more options. ""SAUCY"" seems like a good candidate:
- Starts with S.
- A in position 2.
- Uses C, U, Y which are allowed.
- No ruled-out letters.

Let me check if there are any other better options. ""SAUCY"" seems the most straightforward.

Let's update what we now know after the fourth guess.

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. stand → S(✓) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is locked in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - T, N, D are not in the word.

3. slash → S(✓) L(x) A(-) S(-) H(x)
   - S is confirmed in position 1.
   - L and H are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already known) and not in position 4 (because in slash it was in position 4 and got (-)).
   - The second S in position 4 is invalid, so the word can't have two S's.

4. saucy → S(✓) A(✓) U(x) C(x) Y(x)
   - S is confirmed in position 1.
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - U, C, Y are not in the word.

So far:
- Word starts with S A _ _ _
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, T, N, D, L, H, U, C, Y
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S A
- Uses only the remaining letters for positions 3, 4, 5
- Must be a valid English word

Looking at common 5-letter words starting with SA:
- SAFER (E ruled out)
- SAGGY (G, Y; Y ruled out)
- SAVY (only 4 letters)
- SAVVY (only 4 letters)
- SABIN (N ruled out)
- SABER (E, R ruled out)
- SABLE (E, L ruled out)
- SACKS (C, K; C ruled out)
- SADLY (D, L ruled out)
- SAINT (I, N, T; N, T ruled out)
- SALES (E, L ruled out)
- SALLY (L, Y ruled out)
- SAMBA (M, B; B allowed, M allowed)
- SAMS (only 4 letters)
- SANTI (I, N; N ruled out)
- SAPPY (P, Y; Y ruled out)
- SARGE (E, R, G; E, R ruled out)
- SASHA (H ruled out)
- SASSY (S already used twice, which is invalid)
- SATIN (T, N ruled out)
- SAVAN (V, N; N ruled out)
- SAVIA (V, I, A; A already used in position 2)
- SAVOR (O ruled out)
- SAVVY (already considered)
- SAWED (E, D ruled out)
- SAWFY (F, Y; Y ruled out)
- SAWGY (G, Y; Y ruled out)
- SAWMM (M; M allowed, but double M is possible)
- SAWNY (N ruled out)
- SAWPY (P, Y; Y ruled out)
- SAWRY (R ruled out)
- SAWSY (S already used)
- SAWTY (T ruled out)
- SAWVY (V, Y; Y ruled out)
- SAWZY (Z, Y; Y ruled out)
- SAWYER (E, R ruled out)
- SAWYUM (U ruled out)
- SAWYER (already considered)
- SABIN (already considered)
- SAMBA (M, B; both allowed)
- SAMBA seems valid:
   - S A M B A
   - Letters used: S, A, M, B, A
   - S is in position 1 (correct)
   - A is in position 2 (correct)
   - M, B are new letters not ruled out
   - No duplicates of ruled-out letters
   - It's a valid English word (a dance style)

Let me check if there are any other possibilities:
- SAMBA seems the most straightforward valid word fitting all constraints.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word starts with S A _ _ _
- The remaining letters must come from the unused pool (B, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z)
- SAMBA is a valid English word that fits these constraints.

   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - T, N, D are not in the word.

3. slash → S(✓) L(x) A(-) S(-) H(x)
   - S is confirmed in position 1.
   - L and H are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 or 4 (from stand and slash feedback).
   - The second S in position 4 is invalid, so no second S.

4. saucy → S(✓) A(✓) U(x) C(x) Y(x)
   - S is confirmed in position 1.
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - U, C, Y are not in the word.

5. samba → S(✓) A(✓) M(✓) B(x) A(-)
   - S is confirmed in position 1.
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - M is in the word but not in position 3 (because in samba it was in position 3 and got (-)).
   - B is not in the word.
   - The last A is invalid (got (-)), so position 5 is not A.

So the word structure is now:
S A _ _ _

Letters known to be in the word:
- S (position 1)
- A (position 2)
- M (somewhere in positions 4 or 5)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
R, O, E, T, N, D, L, H, U, C, Y, B

Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet excluding the above):
F, G, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S A
- Contains M in position 4 or 5
- Uses only the remaining letters for the other positions

Possible patterns:
- S A _ M _
- S A _ _ M
