For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants. This should give us good feedback about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E, which are very common vowels. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(x) – R is not in the word
- O(x) – O is not the word
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) – E is not in the word

So we know:
- The word contains A and S
- The word does NOT contain R, O, or E
- A is not in slot 1, S is not in slot 4

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A and S
- Does not have R, O, or E
- Has A somewhere other than position 1
- Has S somewhere other than position 4

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already used and O/E are out)

Let me try ""STAIN"":
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S only can't be in position 4)
- T, A, I, N – all allowed letters
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since A can't be in position 1)
- No R, O, or E

Let's update what we know after both guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R, O, E are NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

From Guess 2 (STAIN):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because S(-) in position 1).
- T, N are NOT in the word.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because A(-) in position 3).
- I is in the word AND in position 4 (I(✓) in position 4).

So the constraints so far:
1. Must contain: A, S, I
2. Must NOT contain: R, O, E, T, N
3. Position 4 is fixed as I.
4. A cannot be in position 1 or 3.
5. S cannot be in position 1 or 4.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5. But position 4 is already I, so A must be in 2 or 5.
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5.

We need to form a 5-letter word with A, S, I and two other letters that are not R, O, E, T, N. Remaining common letters: C, D, L, M, P, U, etc.

Let's try to place A and S:
- If A is in position 2, then S could be in 3 or 5.
- If A is in position 5, then S could be in 2 or 3.

Let's consider A in position 2 and S in position 3:
Word pattern: _ A S _ _
We need two more letters from allowed set (C, D, L, M, P, U, etc.) and position 1 and 5 must be filled.

Let's try ""C"" and ""M"": C A S M _ → but we need a valid word. ""C"" and ""M"" don't form a word here.

Let's try ""C"" and ""P"": C A S P _ → ""CASP_"" - not a word.

Let's try ""L"" and ""M"": L A S M _ → ""LASMS"" - not a word.

Let's try ""P"" and ""L"": P A S L _ → ""PASLS"" - not a word.

Let's try ""C"" and ""L"": C A S L _ → ""CASLS"" - not a word.

Let's try A in position 5 and S in position 2:
Word pattern: _ S _ _ A
We need letters for positions 1, 3, 4. Position 4 is already I, so pattern: _ S _ I A

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: C, D, L, M, P, U, etc.

Let's try ""C"" and ""L"": C S L I A → ""CSLIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""P"" and ""L"": P S L I A → ""PSLIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""C"" and ""M"": C S M I A → ""CSMIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""D"" and ""L"": D S L I A → ""DSLIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""L"" and ""D"": L S D I A → ""LSDIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""C"" and ""D"": C S D I A → ""CSDIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""C"" and ""U"": C S U I A → ""CSUIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""D"" and ""U"": D S U I A → ""DSUIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""M"" and ""U"": M S U I A → ""MSUIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""P"" and ""U"": P S U I A → ""PSUIA"" - not a word.

Hmm, none of these combinations seem to form valid words. Let's try a different approach.

Since A must be in position 2 or 5, and S must be in 2, 3, or 5, and position 4 is I, let's list possible words:

If A is in position 2:
_ A _ _ _
With S in position 3 or 5:
- _ A S _ _ : need two letters for positions 1 and 5, not R,O,E,T,N.
  Example: C A S _ _ → ""CASH_"" - but H is allowed? Wait, H wasn't excluded.
  Let me check allowed letters again: excluded are R,O,E,T,N. So H is allowed.

  C A S H _ → ""CASH_"" - need a 5-letter word. ""CASH_"" - ""CASHY"" - but Y is allowed? Not sure.

  Let's try ""C A S H Y"" - but this is 5 letters: ""CASHY"" - but is this a valid word? Maybe not.

  Let's try ""L A S H Y"" - ""LASHY"" - not a common word.

  Let's try ""P A S S Y"" - but S is already in position 3, and we can't have two S's? Not sure if duplicates are allowed.

  Let's try ""C A S S Y"" - same issue.

  Let's try ""C A S H E"" - but E is excluded.

  Let's try ""C A S H O"" - O is excluded.

  Let's try ""C A S H T"" - T is excluded.

  Let's try ""C A S H N"" - N is excluded.

  Let's try ""C A S H R"" - R is excluded.

  Let's try ""C A S H L"" - ""CASHL"" - not a word.

  Let's try ""C A S H D"" - ""CASHD"" - not a word.

  Let's try ""C A S H M"" - ""CASHM"" - not a word.

  Let's try ""C A S H P"" - ""CASHP"" - not a word.

  Let's try ""C A S H U"" - ""CASHU"" - not a word.

  Let's try ""C A S H Y"" - ""CASHY"" - not a word.

  Maybe ""C A S H I A"" - too long.

  Let's try ""C A S H E R"" - too long.

  Hmm, seems like no valid word here.

Let's try A in position 5 and S in position 3:
Word pattern: _ _ S _ A

_ _ S I A

U L S I A → ""ULSIA"" - not a word.

""LAPIS"" seems the closest valid word, but it's ""LAPIS"" (L-A-P-I-S). Let's check if this fits all constraints:
- Contains A, S, I: Yes.
- Does not contain R, O, E, T, N: Yes.
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A can't be in 1 or 3).
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S can't be in 1 or 4).
- I is in position 4 (matches the feedback).

""LAPIS"" is a valid English word (short for ""lapidary"" or referring to stone), so this seems like a good next guess.

</think>

Based on the feedback, we know:
- The word must contain A, S, and I.
- The word must NOT contain R, O, E, T, or N.
- Position 4 is fixed as I.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

A valid word fitting these constraints is ""LAPIS"".

<guess>LAPIS</guess>",LAPIS,"Let's update what we know after both guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R, O, E are NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

From Guess 2 (STAIN):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because S(-) in position 1).
- T, N are NOT in the word.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because A(-) in position 3).
- I is in the word AND in position 4 (I(✓) in position 4).

So the constraints so far:
1. Must contain: A, S, I
2. Must NOT contain: R, O, E, T, N
3. Position 4 is fixed as I.
4. A cannot be in position 1 or 3.
5. S cannot be in position 1 or 4.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5. But position 4 is already I, so A must be in 2 or 5.
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5.

We need to form a 5-letter word with A, S, I and two other letters that are not R, O, E, T, N. Remaining common letters: C, D, L, M, P, U, etc.

Let's try to place A and S:
- If A is in position 2, then S could be in 3 or 5.
- If A is in position 5, then S could be in 2 or 3.

Let's consider A in position 2 and S in position 3:
Word pattern: _ A S _ _
We need two more letters from allowed set (C, D, L, M, P, U, etc.) and position 1 and 5 must be filled.

Let's try ""C"" and ""M"": C A S M _ → but we need a valid word. ""C"" and ""M"" don't form a word here.

Let's try ""C"" and ""P"": C A S P _ → ""CASP_"" - not a word.

Let's try ""L"" and ""M"": L A S M _ → ""LASMS"" - not a word.

Let's try ""P"" and ""L"": P A S L _ → ""PASLS"" - not a word.

Let's try ""C"" and ""L"": C A S L _ → ""CASLS"" - not a word.

Let's try A in position 5 and S in position 2:
Word pattern: _ S _ _ A
We need letters for positions 1, 3, 4. Position 4 is already I, so pattern: _ S _ I A

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: C, D, L, M, P, U, etc.

Let's try ""C"" and ""L"": C S L I A → ""CSLIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""P"" and ""L"": P S L I A → ""PSLIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""C"" and ""M"": C S M I A → ""CSMIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""D"" and ""L"": D S L I A → ""DSLIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""L"" and ""D"": L S D I A → ""LSDIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""C"" and ""D"": C S D I A → ""CSDIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""C"" and ""U"": C S U I A → ""CSUIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""D"" and ""U"": D S U I A → ""DSUIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""M"" and ""U"": M S U I A → ""MSUIA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""P"" and ""U"": P S U I A → ""PSUIA"" - not a word.

Hmm, none of these combinations seem to form valid words. Let's try a different approach.

Since A must be in position 2 or 5, and S must be in 2, 3, or 5, and position 4 is I, let's list possible words:

If A is in position 2:
_ A _ _ _
With S in position 3 or 5:
- _ A S _ _ : need two letters for positions 1 and 5, not R,O,E,T,N.
  Example: C A S _ _ → ""CASH_"" - but H is allowed? Wait, H wasn't excluded.
  Let me check allowed letters again: excluded are R,O,E,T,N. So H is allowed.

  C A S H _ → ""CASH_"" - need a 5-letter word. ""CASH_"" - ""CASHY"" - but Y is allowed? Not sure.

  Let's try ""C A S H Y"" - but this is 5 letters: ""CASHY"" - but is this a valid word? Maybe not.

  Let's try ""L A S H Y"" - ""LASHY"" - not a common word.

  Let's try ""P A S S Y"" - but S is already in position 3, and we can't have two S's? Not sure if duplicates are allowed.

  Let's try ""C A S S Y"" - same issue.

  Let's try ""C A S H E"" - but E is excluded.

  Let's try ""C A S H O"" - O is excluded.

  Let's try ""C A S H T"" - T is excluded.

  Let's try ""C A S H N"" - N is excluded.

  Let's try ""C A S H R"" - R is excluded.

  Let's try ""C A S H L"" - ""CASHL"" - not a word.

  Let's try ""C A S H D"" - ""CASHD"" - not a word.

  Let's try ""C A S H M"" - ""CASHM"" - not a word.

  Let's try ""C A S H P"" - ""CASHP"" - not a word.

  Let's try ""C A S H U"" - ""CASHU"" - not a word.

  Let's try ""C A S H Y"" - ""CASHY"" - not a word.

  Maybe ""C A S H I A"" - too long.

  Let's try ""C A S H E R"" - too long.

  Hmm, seems like no valid word here.

Let's try A in position 5 and S in position 3:
Word pattern: _ _ S _ A
With I in position 4:
_ _ S I A
Need letters for positions 1 and 2 from allowed set (C, D, L, M, P, U, etc.).

U L S I A → ""ULSIA"" - not a word.
U M S I A → ""UMSIA"" - not a word.
U P S I A → ""UPSIA"" - not a word.

None of these seem to form valid words. Let's try S in position 2 and A in position 5:
Word pattern: _ S _ _ A
With I in position 4:
_ S _ I A
Need letters for positions 1 and 3 from allowed set.

Possible combinations:

Still no valid words. Let's try S in position 5 and A in position 2:
Word pattern: _ A _ _ S
With I in position 4:
_ A _ I S
Need letters for positions 1 and 3 from allowed set.

Possible combinations:

C A P I S → ""CAPIS"" - not a word.
D A L I S → ""DALIS"" - not a word.

U A L I S → ""UALIS"" - not a word.
U A M I S → ""UAMIS"" - not a word.
U A P I S → ""UAPIS"" - not a word.

""LAPIS"" seems the closest valid word, but it's ""LAPIS"" (L-A-P-I-S). Let's check if this fits all constraints:
- Contains A, S, I: Yes.
- Does not contain R, O, E, T, N: Yes.
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A can't be in 1 or 3).
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S can't be in 1 or 4).
- I is in position 4 (matches the feedback).

""LAPIS"" is a valid English word (short for ""lapidary"" or referring to stone), so this seems like a good next guess.Based on the feedback, we know:
- The word must contain A, S, and I.
- The word must NOT contain R, O, E, T, or N.
- Position 4 is fixed as I.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

A valid word fitting these constraints is ""LAPIS"".",Guess 3: LAPIS -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) A(✓) P(✓) I(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
