For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I want to include as many of these as possible in my first guess. 

A word like ""AROSE"" uses 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" are also strong choices. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities right away.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, E  
Letters we know are in the word: O, S  
Positions ruled out for O: 3rd  
Positions ruled out for S: 4th  

I want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O and S (in different positions than before).
2. Avoids A, R, E.
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Good candidate letters left: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that shifts O and S to new spots and adds new common letters.  
""POINT"" uses P, O, I, N, T – but S is missing.  
""SOULS"" repeats S and uses S in 4th position (forbidden).  
""STOIC"" uses S, T, O, I, C – but S is 1st (allowed) and O is 3rd (forbidden).  
""TOONS"" repeats O and uses S in 5th (allowed), but has N twice.  

A better choice is ""STOIC"" – but O is still in 3rd.  
""SOULS"" is bad because S repeats and position 4 is forbidden.  
""SOUPS"" has S in 1st and 5th – but S is only required once.  
""SOUPS"" also has U and P, which are new letters.  

Wait, O is in position 1 in SOUPS, which is allowed (only position 3 was forbidden).  
S is in position 1 and 5 – but we only need to confirm S once.  
This seems acceptable.  

Another option: ""STOIC"" – but O is in 3rd (forbidden).  
""SOULS"" – S in 4th (forbidden).  
""SOUPS"" – O in 1st, S in 1st and 5th – seems valid.  

But to maximize new letters, maybe ""STOIC"" is better despite O in 3rd being forbidden.  

Wait, no – O in 3rd is forbidden.  
So ""STOIC"" is invalid because O is 3rd.  

Alternative: ""SOUND"" – but no O.  
""SOINS"" – but S in 5th is allowed, O in 1st is allowed.  
""SOINS"" uses S, O, I, N, S – but S repeats.  

Best seems ""SOUPS"" – O in 1st (allowed), S in 1st and 5th (only need one S), plus U and P.  

But to avoid S repetition, better to use ""SOULS"" – but S in 4th is forbidden.  

Alternative: ""STOIC"" is invalid.  
""SOULS"" invalid.  
""SOUPS"" seems best despite S repetition.  

Wait, let me think differently – we only need one S and one O.  
A word like ""STOIC"" has O in 3rd – invalid.  
""SPOIL"" has S in 1st, O in 3rd – invalid.  
""SOILS"" has S in 1st and 5th – but O in 3rd – invalid.  

Another approach: place O in 2nd or 4th.  
""FOIST"" – but F is new, O in 2nd (allowed), S in 4th (forbidden).  
""POINT"" – lacks S.  
""TONIC"" – lacks S.  

""SOILS"" – S in 1st and 5th, O in 3rd – invalid.  
""SOINS"" – S in 1st and 5th, O in 2nd (allowed).  
""SOINS"" uses S, O, I, N, S – S repeats.  

""SOUPS"" – S in 1st, O in 1st – but O is in 1st (allowed), S is in 1st (allowed).  
But S is repeated.  

""SOULS"" – S in 1st and 5th, O in 2nd (allowed).  
This seems valid – S in 1st and 5th, O in 2nd.  

But we don’t know if S appears once or twice.  

A better word without S repetition: ""SOULS"" is okay.  

Alternatively, ""SOULS"" – S in 1st and 5th, O in 2nd.  
But we only need one S and one O.  

""SOULS"" is acceptable.  

But to maximize new letters, ""SOULS"" gives U, L.  

Another option: ""SPOIL"" – S in 1st, O in 3rd (invalid).  
""SONIC"" – S in 1st, O in 2nd (allowed), N, I, C.  
This seems good – S in 1st, O in 2nd, plus N, I, C.  

Yes, ""SONIC"" – S in 1st, O in 2nd, N, I, C.  
This avoids forbidden positions and introduces new letters.  

Let’s go with ""SONIC"".

Let’s consolidate what we know so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, E, C  
Letters that ARE in the word: O, S, N, I  
Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- I cannot be in position 4
- N is in position 3 (✓)

So far the pattern looks like: _ _ N _ _ with O, S, I somewhere else.

Possible positions:
- O: 1, 4, 5
- S: 2, 3, 5
- I: 1, 2, 3, 5

We need to place O, S, I into the remaining four slots (positions 1,2,4,5) while respecting the above constraints.

Let’s try to construct a valid word:

Option 1:
- N is fixed in position 3.
- Try O in position 1: O _ N _ _
- S must go in 2, 4, or 5. 4 is allowed for S.
- I must go in 2, 3, or 5. 3 is taken by N, so 2 or 5.
- If S is in 4 and I is in 2: O I N S _ → need a final letter.  Available letters (not yet used and not excluded): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  Let’s pick a common one: O I N S T → ""OINST"" – not a valid word.

Option 2:
- O in position 4: _ _ N O _
- S must go in 2 or 5 (can’t be 1 or 4).  Let’s try S in 2: _ S N O _
- I must go in 1 or 5.  Let’s try I in 1: I S N O _ → need a final letter.  ""ISNOR"" – not a word.  ""ISNOT"" – not a word.  ""ISNO_"" – no common word.

Option 3:
- O in position 5: _ _ N _ O
- S must go in 2 or 3 (3 is N), so S in 2: _ S N _ O
- I must go in 1, 2, or 5.  2 is S, 5 is O, so I in 1: I S N _ O → need a letter for position 4.  ""ISNDO"" – no.  ""ISNFO"" – no.  ""ISNGO"" – no.  Not working.

Option 4:
- O in position 1: O _ N _ _
- S must go in 2, 4, or 5.  Let’s try S in 5: O _ N _ S
- I must go in 2 or 4.  Let’s try I in 2: O I N _ S → need position 4.  ""OINIS"" – no.  ""OINKS"" – has K, which is allowed.  ""OINKS"" is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- O in 1: allowed (was only ruled out of 2 and 3)
- I in 2: allowed (was only ruled out of 4)
- N in 3: ✓
- S in 5: allowed (was ruled out of 1 and 4)
- K is new and allowed.

Thus, ""OINKS"" satisfies all constraints.
