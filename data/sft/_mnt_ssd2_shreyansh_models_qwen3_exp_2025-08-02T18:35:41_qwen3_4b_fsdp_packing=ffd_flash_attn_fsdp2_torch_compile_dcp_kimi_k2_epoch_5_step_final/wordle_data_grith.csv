For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly narrow down possibilities.

One popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of frequent letters and positions, helping to identify which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- T is in the correct position (position 4).
- S, L, A, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has:
- T as its 4th letter: _ _ _ T _
- No S, L, A, E anywhere.

Now I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has T in the 4th position.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, E.

Good consonants left to try: R, N, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong second guess should introduce new common letters. Let’s try “POINT”:
- P, O, I, N are all new letters.
- T is already confirmed in position 4, so this fits perfectly.

This will help test the remaining positions and letters efficiently.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters we know are NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, E, P, O, N, D, F  

Letters we know ARE in the word and their positions:  
- I is in position 3 (✓ in DRIFT)  
- R is in position 2 (✓ in DRIFT)  
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (because it was “-” in POINT and DRIFT).  
  Therefore T must be in position 1 or 3.  
  Position 3 is already taken by I, so T must be in position 1.

So the pattern so far is:

We still need to determine the 4th and 5th letters.  
Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, E, P, O, N, D, F.  
Remaining common consonants: C, G, H, M, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, E, O are out).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep T R I fixed in positions 1-3.
2. Try new letters for positions 4 and 5.
3. Prefer common letters to maximize information.

Let’s try “TRICK”:

- K is new and common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly narrow down possibilities.

One popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives good coverage of frequent letters and positions, helping to identify which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- T is in the correct position (position 4).
- S, L, A, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has:
- T as its 4th letter: _ _ _ T _
- No S, L, A, E anywhere.

Now I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has T in the 4th position.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, E.

Good consonants left to try: R, N, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong second guess should introduce new common letters. Let’s try “POINT”:
- P, O, I, N are all new letters.
- T is already confirmed in position 4, so this fits perfectly.

This will help test the remaining positions and letters efficiently.

From all feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, P, O, N, D, F, C, K  
- Letters confirmed in the word:  
  – I is in position 3 (✓ in DRIFT and TRICK)  
  – R is in position 2 (✓ in DRIFT and TRICK)  
  – T is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, 5 (because it was “-” in SLATE, POINT, DRIFT, TRICK).  
    Therefore T must be in position 3.  
    However, position 3 is already taken by I.  
    This is a contradiction unless we re-examine.

Wait! Let’s re-check T placement:

- SLATE: T(✓) → T is in position 4.  
- POINT: T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
- DRIFT: T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already known).  
- TRICK: T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 1.

So T must be in position 3.  
But position 3 is already I (✓).  
Therefore, our earlier deduction was flawed.

Correct deduction:  
- SLATE: T(✓) → T is in position 4.  
- POINT: T(-) → T is NOT in position 5.  
- DRIFT: T(-) → T is NOT in position 5 (redundant).  
- TRICK: T(-) → T is NOT in position 1.

Thus, T must be in position 4 (from SLATE) and also NOT in positions 1, 5.  
So the word pattern is: _ R I _ T

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):  
B, G, H, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any others not listed.

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ R I _ T and uses only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:  
- BRIFT → but F is out.  
- GRIFT → F is out.  
- PRIFT → P is out.  
- TRIFT → T is already in position 4; word would be T R I _ T, but position 4 is T and 5 would be T, which is impossible.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters we know are NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, E, P, O, N, D, F  

Letters we know ARE in the word and their positions:  
- I is in position 3 (✓ in DRIFT)  
- R is in position 2 (✓ in DRIFT)  
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (because it was “-” in POINT and DRIFT).  
  Therefore T must be in position 1 or 3.  
  Position 3 is already taken by I, so T must be in position 1.

So the pattern so far is:  
T R I _ _

We still need to determine the 4th and 5th letters.  
Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, E, P, O, N, D, F.  
Remaining common consonants: C, G, H, M, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, E, O are out).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep T R I fixed in positions 1-3.
2. Try new letters for positions 4 and 5.
3. Prefer common letters to maximize information.

Let’s try “TRICK”:
- C is new and common.
- K is new and common.
- Both positions 4 and 5 are fresh.

From all feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, P, O, N, D, F, C, K  
- Letters confirmed in the word:  
  – I is in position 3 (✓ in DRIFT and TRICK)  
  – R is in position 2 (✓ in DRIFT and TRICK)  
  – T is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, 5 (because it was “-” in SLATE, POINT, DRIFT, TRICK).  
    Therefore T must be in position 3.  
    However, position 3 is already taken by I.  
    This is a contradiction unless we re-examine.

Wait! Let’s re-check T placement:

- SLATE: T(✓) → T is in position 4.  
- POINT: T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
- DRIFT: T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already known).  
- TRICK: T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 1.

So T must be in position 3.  
But position 3 is already I (✓).  
Therefore, our earlier deduction was flawed.

Correct deduction:  
- SLATE: T(✓) → T is in position 4.  
- POINT: T(-) → T is NOT in position 5.  
- DRIFT: T(-) → T is NOT in position 5 (redundant).  
- TRICK: T(-) → T is NOT in position 1.

Thus, T must be in position 4 (from SLATE) and also NOT in positions 1, 5.  
So the word pattern is: _ R I _ T

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):  
B, G, H, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus any others not listed.

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ R I _ T and uses only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:  
- BRIFT → but F is out.  
- GRIFT → F is out.  
- PRIFT → P is out.  
- TRIFT → T is already in position 4; word would be T R I _ T, but position 4 is T and 5 would be T, which is impossible.  
- CRIFT → C is out.  
- BRINT → N is out.  
- GRINT → N is out.  
- BRUIT → U is allowed, I is allowed, T is allowed.  
  BRUIT: B, R, U, I, T → all letters are allowed.

Let’s try BRUIT.From the feedback we now know:
- The word pattern is _ R I _ T (R in position 2, I in position 3, T in position 5).
- Letters already ruled out include S, L, A, E, P, O, N, D, F, C, K.
- The only remaining letters to test for positions 1 and 4 are B, G, H, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A valid word fitting _ R I _ T is BRUIT (B, R, U, I, T).

Let’s carefully extract every constraint from the feedback.

Known positions:
- R is in position 2 (✓ in DRIFT, TRICK, BRUIT)
- I is in position 3 (✓ in DRIFT, TRICK, BRUIT)

Known letters NOT in the word at all:
S, L, A, E, P, O, N, D, F, C, K, B, U

Known letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still uncertain:
- T (from SLATE it was ✓ in position 4, but in POINT, DRIFT, TRICK, BRUIT it was “-”, meaning it is NOT in positions 1, 5, 4, 5 respectively. This is contradictory unless we re-examine.)

Re-examining T placement:
- SLATE: T(✓) → T is in position 4.
- POINT: T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 5.
- DRIFT: T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (redundant).
- TRICK: T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- BRUIT: T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Therefore, T must be in position 4 (from SLATE) and also NOT in positions 1 or 5. This is consistent.

Current pattern: _ R I T _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): G, H, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern ? R I T ? using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- GRIT? – but we need 5 letters and position 5 is open. GRIFT is invalid (F is out). 
- PRIT? – P is out.
- TRIT? – T is already in position 4, so position 1 would be T, but TRIT_ is 4 letters.
- CRIT? – C is out.
- FRIT? – F is out.
- GRIT? – GRIT is 4 letters.
- PRIT? – P is out.
- TRIT? – same issue.

Looking at the allowed letters for position 1 and 5: G, H, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A valid 5-letter word fitting _ R I T _ is “GRITY” – but that’s not a standard word.
