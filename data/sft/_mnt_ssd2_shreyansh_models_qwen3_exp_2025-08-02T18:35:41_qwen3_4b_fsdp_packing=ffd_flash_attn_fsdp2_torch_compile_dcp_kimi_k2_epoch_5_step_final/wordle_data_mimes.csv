Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that appear in many English words, which should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback:
- C, R, A, N are all absent (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it must be in positions 1-4).

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter E (but not in position 5).
2. Does NOT contain C, R, A, N.

Good consonants to try next: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, O, U (since A is out and E is confirmed).

A strong candidate is ""STILE"":
- S, T, I, L, E.
- E is in position 4 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.
- It avoids C, R, A, N.
- It uses common letters S, T, I, L.

Another candidate could be ""MOTEL"", but that has T and L which are good, but E is in position 5 here which we know is wrong. So ""STILE"" seems better.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
   – Letters C, R, A, N are completely absent.  
   – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. STILE → S(-) T(x) I(-) L(x) E(-)  
   – T and L are absent.  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – E is still in the word but NOT in position 4 (because it got “-” again).

Summary of constraints so far:
- Must contain: E, S, I  
- Must NOT contain: C, R, A, N, T, L  
- E cannot be in position 5 (from CRANE) or 4 (from STILE) → E must be in 1, 2, or 3.  
- S cannot be in position 1 (from STILE) → S must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
- I cannot be in position 3 (from STILE) → I must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that uses E, S, I plus two more letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not C, R, A, N, T, L).

Candidate letters left (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place E, S, I under the constraints:
- If E is in position 2:  
  – S must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
  – I must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
  – Possible word: I E S _ _ or I _ S E _ etc.  
  – Example: “ISENB” (but not a valid word).  
  – “SPIKE” – but K and P are allowed, and P is allowed.  
  – Let’s check “SPIKE”:  
      S(1) – but S cannot be in 1 (from STILE feedback). So invalid.

- If E is in position 3:  
  – S must be in 2, 4, or 5.  
  – I must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
  – Example: I S E _ _ or _ I S E _ etc.  
  – “WISED” – but D is allowed.  
  – “WISER” – R is ruled out.  
  – “PIES” – too short.  
  – “SPIKE” – S in 1 invalid.  
  – “MISER” – R ruled out.  
  – “MISKE” – K allowed, but E is in 5 (invalid).  
  – “MISKE” invalid (E in 5).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that appear in many English words, which should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C, R, A, N are all absent (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it must be in positions 1-4).

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter E (but not in position 5).
2. Does NOT contain C, R, A, N.

Good consonants to try next: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, O, U (since A is out and E is confirmed).

A strong candidate is ""STILE"":
- S, T, I, L, E.
- E is in position 4 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.
- It avoids C, R, A, N.
- It uses common letters S, T, I, L.

Another candidate could be ""MOTEL"", but that has T and L which are good, but E is in position 5 here which we know is wrong. So ""STILE"" seems better.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: C, R, A, N, T, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions we still don’t know: S, I, E  

So the secret word must contain S, I, E exactly once each, and may not contain C, R, A, N, T, L.  
We need a valid 5-letter word that uses only the remaining letters and places S, I, E in new positions.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y

A promising word that uses S, I, E plus two new letters is “BESOM”:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (the most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that appear in many English words, which should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C, R, A, N are all absent (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it must be in positions 1-4).

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter E (but not in position 5).
2. Does NOT contain C, R, A, N.

Good consonants to try next: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, O, U (since A is out and E is confirmed).

A strong candidate is ""STILE"":
- S, T, I, L, E.
- E is in position 4 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.
- It avoids C, R, A, N.
- It uses common letters S, T, I, L.

Another candidate could be ""MOTEL"", but that has T and L which are good, but E is in position 5 here which we know is wrong. So ""STILE"" seems better.

So far we know the word contains: S, M, I, E exactly once each, and one additional letter that has not been ruled out.  
Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, N, T, L, B, O, D  
Remaining possible letters: F, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y  

We also know the positions:
- Position 4 is E (fixed)
- S cannot be in position 1  
- M cannot be in position 2  
- I cannot be in position 3  

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, M, I, E plus one of the remaining letters, and respects the positional constraints.

Let’s list possible words:
