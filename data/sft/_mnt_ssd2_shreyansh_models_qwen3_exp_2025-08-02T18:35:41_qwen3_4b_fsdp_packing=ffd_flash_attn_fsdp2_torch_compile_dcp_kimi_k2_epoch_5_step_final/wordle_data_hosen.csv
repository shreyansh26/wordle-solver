For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

Let me think of words that fit:
- ""stone"" uses S, T, O, N, E
  - S is now in position 1 (was 4)
  - O is now in position 3 (was 3) → conflict, O cannot be in position 3
- ""souse"" uses S, O, U, S, E
  - O is in position 2 (was 3) - good
  - S is in positions 1 and 4 (was 4) - conflict for second S
- ""seize"" uses S, E, I, Z, E
  - S is in position 1 (was 4) - good
  - E is in positions 2 and 5 (was 5) - conflict for second E
- ""sovereign"" is too long
- ""spose"" uses S, P, O, S, E
  - S is in positions 1 and 4 (was 4) - conflict
- ""steed"" uses S, T, E, E, D
  - E is in positions 3 and 5 (was 5) - conflict
- ""tooes"" uses T, O, O, E, S
  - O is in positions 2 and 3 (was 3) - conflict
- ""voles"" uses V, O, L, E, S
  - O is in position 2 (was 3) - good
  - E is in position 4 (was 5) - good
  - S is in position 5 (was 4) - good
  - V and L are new letters to test
  - This seems valid

""voles"" meets all criteria:
- Contains O, S, E (confirmed letters)
- O is in position 2 (was 3)
- S is in position 5 (was 4)
- E is in position 4 (was 5)
- Does not contain A or R
- Introduces V and L to test new letters

From the new feedback on ""voles"":
- V is not in the word (x)
- O is in the correct position (position 2) (✓)
- L is not in the word (x)
- E is in the correct position (position 4) (✓)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Has O in position 2
- Has E in position 4
- Has S somewhere else (not position 5)
- Does not contain A, R, V, L

Current pattern: _ O _ E _ with an S somewhere in the remaining slots (positions 1, 3, or 5) but not 5 (since S is in the word but not in position 5 from arose feedback). Wait, arose had S in position 4 (wrong), so S is not in position 4. From voles, S is in the word but not in position 5. So S must be in position 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- S O _ E _
- _ O S E _

Letters left to test: common ones like T, N, I, C, D, U, etc.

Let's try ""stone"":
- S in position 1 (valid)
- T new
- O in position 2 (correct)
- N new
- E in position 4 (correct)
- S is in position 1 (not 5), satisfies all constraints
- No forbidden letters (A,R,V,L)

This seems perfect.

Let's consolidate everything we now know after three guesses.

1. arose: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)

   - A and R are not in the word.

2. voles: V(x) O(✓) L(x) E(✓) S(-)

   - T is not in the word.

   - N is in the word but not in position 4 (but E is in position 4, so N is not in position 4, which is fine).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (already knew it's in position 4).

So the secret word has the pattern:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- S must be in position 3 (because it can't be in 1 or 5, and position 2 is O)
- Positions 1 and 5 are still unknown, but we know:
   - Letters already ruled out: A, R, V, L, T
   - Common remaining letters to test: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, W, Y

Let's try a word that fits the pattern _ O S E _ and uses common letters.

Possible candidates:
- D O S E D
- C O S E Y
- P O S E D
- M O S E S

Among these, ""posed"" uses P and D which are common and haven't been tested yet.

Check constraints:
- P not ruled out
- O in position 2 ✓
- S in position 3 ✓
- E in position 4 ✓
- D not ruled out
- No forbidden letters (A,R,V,L,T)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O, S, E, but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively
- Does not contain A or R

1. Uses O, S, E (since they are confirmed in the word)
2. Avoids A and R
3. Places O, S, E in different positions than before (O not in position 3, S not in position 4, E not in position 5)

Let me think of words that fit:

  - S is now in position 1 (was 4)
  - O is now in position 3 (was 3) → conflict, O cannot be in position 3

  - S is in position 1 (was 4) - good
  - E is in positions 2 and 5 (was 5) - conflict for second E
- ""sovereign"" is too long
- ""spose"" uses S, P, O, S, E
  - S is in positions 1 and 4 (was 4) - conflict
- ""steed"" uses S, T, E, E, D
  - E is in positions 3 and 5 (was 5) - conflict

  - O is in positions 2 and 3 (was 3) - conflict
- ""voles"" uses V, O, L, E, S
  - O is in position 2 (was 3) - good

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O, S, E, but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively
- Does not contain A or R

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O, S, E (since they are confirmed in the word)
2. Avoids A and R
3. Places O, S, E in different positions than before (O not in position 3, S not in position 4, E not in position 5)

Let me think of words that fit:
- ""stone"" uses S, T, O, N, E
  - S is now in position 1 (was 4)
  - O is now in position 3 (was 3) → conflict, O cannot be in position 3
- ""souse"" uses S, O, U, S, E
  - O is in position 2 (was 3) - good
  - S is in positions 1 and 4 (was 4) - conflict for second S
- ""seize"" uses S, E, I, Z, E
  - S is in position 1 (was 4) - good
  - E is in positions 2 and 5 (was 5) - conflict for second E
- ""sovereign"" is too long
- ""spose"" uses S, P, O, S, E
  - S is in positions 1 and 4 (was 4) - conflict
- ""steed"" uses S, T, E, E, D
  - E is in positions 3 and 5 (was 5) - conflict
- ""tooes"" uses T, O, O, E, S
  - O is in positions 2 and 3 (was 3) - conflict
- ""voles"" uses V, O, L, E, S
  - O is in position 2 (was 3) - good
  - E is in position 4 (was 5) - good
  - S is in position 5 (was 4) - good
  - V and L are new letters to test
  - This seems valid

""voles"" meets all criteria:
- Contains O, S, E (confirmed letters)
- O is in position 2 (was 3)
- S is in position 5 (was 4)
- E is in position 4 (was 5)
- Does not contain A or R
- Introduces V and L to test new letters

From the new feedback on ""voles"":
- V is not in the word (x)
- O is in the correct position (position 2) (✓)
- L is not in the word (x)
- E is in the correct position (position 4) (✓)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Has O in position 2
- Has E in position 4
- Has S somewhere else (not position 5)
- Does not contain A, R, V, L

Current pattern: _ O _ E _ with an S somewhere in the remaining slots (positions 1, 3, or 5) but not 5 (since S is in the word but not in position 5 from arose feedback). Wait, arose had S in position 4 (wrong), so S is not in position 4. From voles, S is in the word but not in position 5. So S must be in position 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- S O _ E _
- _ O S E _

Letters left to test: common ones like T, N, I, C, D, U, etc.

Let's try ""stone"":
- S in position 1 (valid)
- T new
- O in position 2 (correct)
- N new
- E in position 4 (correct)
- S is in position 1 (not 5), satisfies all constraints
- No forbidden letters (A,R,V,L)

This seems perfect.

Let's consolidate everything we now know after three guesses.

1. arose: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - O, S, E are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. voles: V(x) O(✓) L(x) E(✓) S(-)
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - E is in position 4 (✓).
   - S is in the word but not in position 5.
   - V and L are not in the word.

3. stone: S(-) T(x) O(-) N(-) E(-)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T is not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3 (already knew it's in position 2, so this is consistent).
   - N is in the word but not in position 4 (but E is in position 4, so N is not in position 4, which is fine).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (already knew it's in position 4).

So the secret word has the pattern:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- S must be in position 3 (because it can't be in 1 or 5, and position 2 is O)
- Positions 1 and 5 are still unknown, but we know:
   - Letters already ruled out: A, R, V, L, T
   - Common remaining letters to test: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, W, Y

Let's try a word that fits the pattern _ O S E _ and uses common letters.

Possible candidates:
- D O S E D
- C O S E Y
- P O S E D
- M O S E S

Among these, ""posed"" uses P and D which are common and haven't been tested yet.

Check constraints:
- P not ruled out
- O in position 2 ✓
- S in position 3 ✓
- E in position 4 ✓
- D not ruled out
- No forbidden letters (A,R,V,L,T)

This seems like a good next guess.

From the feedback on “nosey”:
- N is in the word but NOT in position 1 (N(-))
- O, S, E are already confirmed in positions 2,3,4 (O(✓), S(✓), E(✓))
- Y is NOT in the word (Y(x))

So the pattern is: _ O S E _ and the 1st letter must be a consonant that has not been ruled out (A, R, V, L, T, P, D, Y are out).  
Letters already used in the word (from feedback): O, S, E, N (but N is not in position 1).  
We still need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ O S E _ and has a first letter that is not any of the ruled-out letters.

Possible first letters (not ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, W, etc.

Looking for common English words:
- B O S E Y → “bos ey” not a word
- C O S E Y → “cos ey” not a word
- F O S E Y → “fosey” not a word
- G O S E Y → “gosey” not a word
- H O S E Y → “hosey” not a word
- J O S E Y → “josey” is a valid word (slang for “jokester”)
- K O S E Y → “kosey” not a word
- M O S E Y → “mosey” is a valid word (slang for “mosey along”)
- W O S E Y → “wosey” not a word
- B O S E D → “bosed” not a word
- C O S E D → “cosed” not a word
- F O S E D → “fosed” not a word
- G O S E D → “gosed” not a word
- H O S E D → “hosed” not a word
- J O S E D → “josed” not a word
- M O S E D → “mosed” not a word
- W O S E D → “wosed” not a word
- C O S E T → “coset” not a word
- F O S E T → “fiset” not a word
- H O S E T → “hosed” already considered
- J O S E T → “josed” already considered
- M O S E T → “mosed” already considered
- W O S E T → “wosed” already considered

The only valid words that fit _ O S E _ and have not been ruled out are:
- J O S E Y
- M O S E Y

Between these, “mosey” is more common in everyday usage, so I’ll choose that.
