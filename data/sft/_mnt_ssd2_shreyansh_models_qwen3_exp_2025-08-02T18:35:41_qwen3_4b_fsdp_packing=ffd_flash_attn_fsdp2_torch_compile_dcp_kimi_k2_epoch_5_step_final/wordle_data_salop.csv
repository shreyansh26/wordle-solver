For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions, helping to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback:
- S is in the correct first position.
- L is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- T and E are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: S _ _ _ _
Letters we know are in the word: L, A (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
Letters we know are NOT in the word: T, E

We need to place L and A somewhere in positions 2-5, and avoid T and E. Also, we should introduce new common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good next letters to try: R, N, I, O, C, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- SALAD – but A is in position 3 which we know is wrong.
- SALON – uses new letters O and N, places A in position 3 (wrong), L in position 2 (could be wrong).
- SCARF – introduces C, R, F, but we already know A is in the word so this might not be optimal.
- SLAIN – uses I and N, places A in position 4 (could be correct), L in position 2 (could be wrong).
- SLASH – uses H and S, but S is already in position 1.

Best choice seems to be ""SLAIN"" because:
- Keeps S in position 1.
- Moves L to position 2 (could be correct or wrong).
- Moves A to position 4 (could be correct).
- Introduces I and N which are common letters.
- Avoids T and E.

However, since A is in the word but not in position 3, placing it in position 4 is a good test. Similarly, L is in the word but not in position 2, so testing position 2 is acceptable.

Another good option is ""SALON"" which places A in position 3 (but we know A is not in position 3), so that's bad.

""SCALD"" – uses C, L, D, but A is in position 3 which is wrong.

""SHALI"" – uses H, I, but A is in position 3 (wrong).

""SLAIN"" seems best among these.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
2. SLAIN → S(✓) L(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)

Key deductions:
- S is locked in position 1.
- L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
- A is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.
- Eliminated letters: T, E, I, N.

So far the pattern is: S _ _ _ _
Letters definitely in the word: L, A
Positions still open for L: 4 or 5
Positions still open for A: 2 or 5

We need to place L and A in the remaining slots while introducing new common letters. Good remaining consonants: R, D, G, C, M, P, B, etc. Good remaining vowels: O, U.

Possible placements:
- If A is in position 2: S A _ _ _
  - Then L must be in position 4 or 5.
- If A is in position 5: S _ _ _ A
  - Then L must be in position 4.

Let’s try A in position 2 and L in position 4: S A _ L _
We need a consonant for position 3. Common ones: R, D, G, C, M, P, B.
""SCALD"" is invalid (D is okay but we've already eliminated N and I, but D is new). However, ""SCALD"" has A in position 3 which we know is wrong.

""SAUL_"" – but we need a 5-letter word. ""SAUL_"" is not valid.

""SAVVY"" – no L.

""SAFEL"" – not a common word.

""SAUL_"" – invalid.

""SAUL_"" – invalid.

""SAUL_"" – invalid.

Let’s try A in position 5: S _ _ _ A
Then L must be in position 4: S _ _ L A

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions, helping to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S is in the correct first position.
- L is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- T and E are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: S _ _ _ _
Letters we know are in the word: L, A (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
Letters we know are NOT in the word: T, E

We need to place L and A somewhere in positions 2-5, and avoid T and E. Also, we should introduce new common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good next letters to try: R, N, I, O, C, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- SALAD – but A is in position 3 which we know is wrong.
- SALON – uses new letters O and N, places A in position 3 (wrong), L in position 2 (could be wrong).
- SCARF – introduces C, R, F, but we already know A is in the word so this might not be optimal.
- SLAIN – uses I and N, places A in position 4 (could be correct), L in position 2 (could be wrong).
- SLASH – uses H and S, but S is already in position 1.

Best choice seems to be ""SLAIN"" because:
- Keeps S in position 1.
- Moves L to position 2 (could be correct or wrong).
- Moves A to position 4 (could be correct).
- Introduces I and N which are common letters.
- Avoids T and E.

However, since A is in the word but not in position 3, placing it in position 4 is a good test. Similarly, L is in the word but not in position 2, so testing position 2 is acceptable.

Another good option is ""SALON"" which places A in position 3 (but we know A is not in position 3), so that's bad.

""SCALD"" – uses C, L, D, but A is in position 3 which is wrong.

""SHALI"" – uses H, I, but A is in position 3 (wrong).

""SLAIN"" seems best among these.

From the two guesses we know:

1. First letter is definitely S.
2. L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
3. A is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.
4. Letters T, E, I, N are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern so far: S _ _ _ _

Available letters (excluding T, E, I, N): A, L, plus the rest of the alphabet minus those four.

We need to place L somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out for L), and A somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since positions 3 and 4 are ruled out for A).

Possible combinations:

- If A is in position 2: S A _ _ _
  - L must be in 4 or 5: S A _ L _ or S A _ _ L
- If A is in position 5: S _ _ _ A
  - L must be in 4: S _ _ L A

Let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit these patterns:

1. S A _ L _: ""SCALE"" – but E is already ruled out.
2. S A _ _ L: ""SALAD"" – but A is already in position 2, and we know A is not in position 4, but this word has A in 2 and 4, which might be possible, but let's see if it's valid.
3. S _ _ L A: ""SPLAL"" – not a word.
4. S _ _ L A: ""SWALD"" – not a word.
5. S _ _ L A: ""SHALM"" – not a word.
6. S _ _ L A: ""SKALD"" – not a word.
7. S _ _ L A: ""SPLAL"" – not a word.

Wait, let's think of actual words:

- ""SALAD"" – but A is in position 4 which we know is wrong.
- ""SALSA"" – but A is in positions 2 and 4, and position 4 is wrong.
- ""SALSA"" – same issue.
- ""SALAD"" – same issue.

Hmm, maybe ""SALSA"" is invalid because A is in position 4.

Let me think differently: since A is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4, and L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, and we know the first letter is S.

Possible positions:
- A can be in 2 or 5.
- L can be in 4 or 5.

Let's list possible words:

1. S A _ L _: ""SALAD"" – A is in 2, L is in 4, but D is new.
   - Check if ""SALAD"" is valid: yes, it's a word.
   - But we know A is not in position 4 (from SLATE feedback), but in SALAD, A is in position 2 and 4. Since A is not in position 4, this is invalid because the second A is in position 4.

2. S A _ _ L: ""SALSA"" – A in 2 and 5, L in 5 – but L would be in 5, which is allowed.
   - Check ""SALSA"": yes, it's a word.
   - A is in 2 and 5: we know A is in the word but not in 3 or 4, so 2 or 5 are fine.
   - L is in 5: we know L is in the word but not in 2 or 3, so 5 is allowed.
   - Letters used: S, A, L, S, A – no T, E, I, N.
   - This seems valid.

3. S _ _ L A: ""SPLLA"" – not a word.
4. S _ _ L A: ""SWALD"" – not a word.
5. S _ _ L A: ""SKALD"" – not a word.

""SALSA"" seems to fit all constraints.

Let me verify:
- S(✓) in position 1.
- A is in positions 2 and 5: positions 3 and 4 are ruled out, so 2 or 5 are fine.
- L is in position 5: positions 2 and 3 are ruled out, so 5 is fine.
- No T, E, I, N.

Therefore, ""SALSA"" is a valid next guess.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions, helping to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback:
- S is in the correct first position.
- L is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- T and E are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: S _ _ _ _
Letters we know are in the word: L, A (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
Letters we know are NOT in the word: T, E

We need to place L and A somewhere in positions 2-5, and avoid T and E. Also, we should introduce new common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good next letters to try: R, N, I, O, C, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- SALAD – but A is in position 3 which we know is wrong.
- SALON – uses new letters O and N, places A in position 3 (wrong), L in position 2 (could be wrong).
- SCARF – introduces C, R, F, but we already know A is in the word so this might not be optimal.
- SLAIN – uses I and N, places A in position 4 (could be correct), L in position 2 (could be wrong).
- SLASH – uses H and S, but S is already in position 1.

Best choice seems to be ""SLAIN"" because:
- Keeps S in position 1.
- Moves L to position 2 (could be correct or wrong).
- Moves A to position 4 (could be correct).
- Introduces I and N which are common letters.
- Avoids T and E.

However, since A is in the word but not in position 3, placing it in position 4 is a good test. Similarly, L is in the word but not in position 2, so testing position 2 is acceptable.

Another good option is ""SALON"" which places A in position 3 (but we know A is not in position 3), so that's bad.

""SCALD"" – uses C, L, D, but A is in position 3 which is wrong.

""SHALI"" – uses H, I, but A is in position 3 (wrong).

""SLAIN"" seems best among these.

From the latest feedback on SALSA:

- S(✓) in position 1: correct.
- A(✓) in position 2: correct.
- L(✓) in position 3: correct.
- S(-): the letter S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern is now: S A L _ _

Letters already placed: S, A, L in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.

Letters known to be in the word but not yet placed: S (cannot be in 4), A (cannot be in 5).

Letters known NOT to be in the word: T, E, I, N.

We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with letters that:
- are not T, E, I, N
- are not S in position 4
- are not A in position 5
- are not already used in the correct positions.

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S and A (but S cannot be in 4, A cannot be in 5).

Since S is in the word but not in position 4, it must be in position 5. But A cannot be in position 5. This is a conflict unless we use another S, but that would duplicate S in positions 1 and 5, which is possible.

But looking at SALSA feedback, the second S in position 4 was marked (-), meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. So S could be in position 5, but A cannot be in position 5. However, we already have A in position 2, and the word can have multiple A's (like SALSA itself). 

But the feedback for SALSA shows A(-) in position 5, meaning A is in the word but not in position 5. Since we already have A in position 2, this is fine.

So the word is S A L _ _. We need to fill positions 4 and 5.

Possible letters for position 4: any letter except S (because S cannot be in position 4), and not T, E, I, N.

Possible letters for position 5: any letter except A (because A cannot be in position 5), and not T, E, I, N.

Let's think of common letters. Position 4 could be D, R, M, etc. Position 5 could be D, R, M, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with SAL:

SALAD – but A is in position 4 which is allowed, and D is new. But A is already in position 2, and the word SALAD has A in position 4, which is allowed because A is in the word but not in position 5 (from SALSA feedback). However, the feedback for SALSA shows A(-) in position 5, meaning A is in the word but not in position 5. This is consistent because SALAD has A in position 4, which is allowed. But SALAD was not guessed yet, so it's a possibility.

Another possibility: SALTY – but T is already ruled out.

SALSA – already guessed.

SALTY – T is out.

SALAD seems the most likely.

But let me check if SALAD fits all constraints:
- S A L A D
- S(✓) in position 1: correct.
- A(✓) in position 2: correct.
- L(✓) in position 3: correct.
- A in position 4: allowed (A is in the word but not in position 5).
- D in position 5: new letter, not ruled out.

This seems valid.

Another possibility: SALCH – but H is possible, but SALCH is not a common word.

SALMY – M is possible, but SALMY is not common.

SALAD seems the best.

But let me think if there's another word. SALSA is already done. SALAD is possible.

But the feedback from SALSA shows S(-) in position 4, meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. This doesn't conflict with SALAD because SALAD has S in position 1 and 5, which is allowed.

So SALAD is a valid next guess.

However, the feedback from SALSA shows A(-) in position 5, meaning A is in the word but not in position 5. This is consistent with SALAD having A in positions 2 and 4.

Thus, the next guess should be SALAD.

But let me double-check:
- S A L A D
- S(✓) position 1: correct.
- A(✓) position 2: correct.
- L(✓) position 3: correct.
- A in position 4: allowed (A is in word, not in 5).
- D in position 5: new, allowed.

This seems correct.

Therefore, the next guess is SALAD.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions, helping to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S is in the correct first position.
- L is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- T and E are not in the word at all.

So the word looks like: S _ _ _ _
Letters we know are in the word: L, A (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
Letters we know are NOT in the word: T, E

We need to place L and A somewhere in positions 2-5, and avoid T and E. Also, we should introduce new common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good next letters to try: R, N, I, O, C, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- SALAD – but A is in position 3 which we know is wrong.
- SALON – uses new letters O and N, places A in position 3 (wrong), L in position 2 (could be wrong).
- SCARF – introduces C, R, F, but we already know A is in the word so this might not be optimal.
- SLAIN – uses I and N, places A in position 4 (could be correct), L in position 2 (could be wrong).
- SLASH – uses H and S, but S is already in position 1.

Best choice seems to be ""SLAIN"" because:
- Keeps S in position 1.
- Moves L to position 2 (could be correct or wrong).
- Moves A to position 4 (could be correct).
- Introduces I and N which are common letters.
- Avoids T and E.

However, since A is in the word but not in position 3, placing it in position 4 is a good test. Similarly, L is in the word but not in position 2, so testing position 2 is acceptable.

Another good option is ""SALON"" which places A in position 3 (but we know A is not in position 3), so that's bad.

""SCALD"" – uses C, L, D, but A is in position 3 which is wrong.

""SHALI"" – uses H, I, but A is in position 3 (wrong).

""SLAIN"" seems best among these.

From the two guesses we know:

1. First letter is definitely S.
2. L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
3. A is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.
4. Letters T, E, I, N are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern so far: S _ _ _ _

Available letters (excluding T, E, I, N): A, L, plus the rest of the alphabet minus those four.

We need to place L somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out for L), and A somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since positions 3 and 4 are ruled out for A).

Possible combinations:

- If A is in position 2: S A _ _ _
  - L must be in 4 or 5: S A _ L _ or S A _ _ L
- If A is in position 5: S _ _ _ A
  - L must be in 4: S _ _ L A

Let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit these patterns:

1. S A _ L _: ""SCALE"" – but E is already ruled out.
2. S A _ _ L: ""SALAD"" – but A is already in position 2, and we know A is not in position 4, but this word has A in 2 and 4, which might be possible, but let's see if it's valid.
3. S _ _ L A: ""SPLAL"" – not a word.
4. S _ _ L A: ""SWALD"" – not a word.
5. S _ _ L A: ""SHALM"" – not a word.
6. S _ _ L A: ""SKALD"" – not a word.
7. S _ _ L A: ""SPLAL"" – not a word.

Wait, let's think of actual words:

- ""SALAD"" – but A is in position 4 which we know is wrong.
- ""SALSA"" – but A is in positions 2 and 4, and position 4 is wrong.
- ""SALSA"" – same issue.
- ""SALAD"" – same issue.

Hmm, maybe ""SALSA"" is invalid because A is in position 4.

Let me think differently: since A is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4, and L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, and we know the first letter is S.

Possible positions:
- A can be in 2 or 5.
- L can be in 4 or 5.

Let's list possible words:

1. S A _ L _: ""SALAD"" – A is in 2, L is in 4, but D is new.
   - Check if ""SALAD"" is valid: yes, it's a word.
   - But we know A is not in position 4 (from SLATE feedback), but in SALAD, A is in position 2 and 4. Since A is not in position 4, this is invalid because the second A is in position 4.

2. S A _ _ L: ""SALSA"" – A in 2 and 5, L in 5 – but L would be in 5, which is allowed.
   - Check ""SALSA"": yes, it's a word.
   - A is in 2 and 5: we know A is in the word but not in 3 or 4, so 2 or 5 are fine.
   - L is in 5: we know L is in the word but not in 2 or 3, so 5 is allowed.
   - Letters used: S, A, L, S, A – no T, E, I, N.
   - This seems valid.

3. S _ _ L A: ""SPLLA"" – not a word.
4. S _ _ L A: ""SWALD"" – not a word.
5. S _ _ L A: ""SKALD"" – not a word.

""SALSA"" seems to fit all constraints.

Let me verify:
- S(✓) in position 1.
- A is in positions 2 and 5: positions 3 and 4 are ruled out, so 2 or 5 are fine.
- L is in position 5: positions 2 and 3 are ruled out, so 5 is fine.
- No T, E, I, N.

Therefore, ""SALSA"" is a valid next guess.

So the word is S A L _ _. We need to fill positions 4 and 5.

Possible letters for position 4: any letter except S (because S cannot be in position 4), and not T, E, I, N.

Possible letters for position 5: any letter except A (because A cannot be in position 5), and not T, E, I, N.

Let's think of common letters. Position 4 could be D, R, M, etc. Position 5 could be D, R, M, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with SAL:

SALAD – but A is in position 4 which is allowed, and D is new. But A is already in position 2, and the word SALAD has A in position 4, which is allowed because A is in the word but not in position 5 (from SALSA feedback). However, the feedback for SALSA shows A(-) in position 5, meaning A is in the word but not in position 5. This is consistent because SALAD has A in position 4, which is allowed. But SALAD was not guessed yet, so it's a possibility.

Another possibility: SALTY – but T is already ruled out.

SALSA – already guessed.

SALTY – T is out.

SALAD seems the most likely.

But let me check if SALAD fits all constraints:
- S A L A D
- S(✓) in position 1: correct.
- A(✓) in position 2: correct.
- L(✓) in position 3: correct.
- A in position 4: allowed (A is in the word but not in position 5).
- D in position 5: new letter, not ruled out.

This seems valid.

Another possibility: SALCH – but H is possible, but SALCH is not a common word.

SALMY – M is possible, but SALMY is not common.

SALAD seems the best.

But let me think if there's another word. SALSA is already done. SALAD is possible.

But the feedback from SALSA shows S(-) in position 4, meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. This doesn't conflict with SALAD because SALAD has S in position 1 and 5, which is allowed.

So SALAD is a valid next guess.

However, the feedback from SALSA shows A(-) in position 5, meaning A is in the word but not in position 5. This is consistent with SALAD having A in positions 2 and 4.

Thus, the next guess should be SALAD.

But let me double-check:
- S A L A D
- S(✓) position 1: correct.
- A(✓) position 2: correct.
- L(✓) position 3: correct.
- A in position 4: allowed (A is in word, not in 5).
- D in position 5: new, allowed.

This seems correct.

Therefore, the next guess is SALAD.

From the latest feedback on SALAD:

- S(✓) in position 1: correct.
- A(✓) in position 2: correct.
- L(✓) in position 3: correct.
- A(-) in position 4: the letter A is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- D(x) in position 5: the letter D is NOT in the word.

So the pattern is now: S A L _ _

We know:
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from SLATE and SALSA feedback). However, we already have A in position 2, so this is satisfied.
- Letters already ruled out: T, E, I, N, D.
- Letters still allowed for positions 4 and 5: any letter except S (cannot be in position 4), A (cannot be in position 5), T, E, I, N, D.

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. Let's think of common letters not yet used: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since A is already in position 2 and cannot be in position 5, position 5 must be a different letter. Also, S is in the word but cannot be in position 4 (from SALSA feedback), so S could be in position 5.

Possible words:
- SALGO – but G and O are possible, but SALGO is not common.
- SALMO – M and O are possible, but SALMO is a word.
- SALTY – T is out.
- SALCH – not a word.

Another possibility: SALVO – V is possible, but SALVO is less common.

SALMO seems the best fit.
