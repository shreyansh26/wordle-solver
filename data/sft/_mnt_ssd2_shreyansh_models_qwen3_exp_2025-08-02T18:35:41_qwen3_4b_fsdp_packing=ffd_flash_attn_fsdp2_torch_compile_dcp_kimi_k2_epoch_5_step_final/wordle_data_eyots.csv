### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, L, N, etc. 

After considering various options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions quickly.
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S).
3. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words, giving good coverage for potential feedback.

This should provide useful information about which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the correct position (4th letter).
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- A and R are not in the word at all.

So we need a word that:
- Has O in the 4th position.
- Contains S somewhere other than 4th.
- Contains E somewhere other than 5th.
- Does not contain A or R.

Possible structure: _ _ _ O _ with S and E somewhere else.

Good candidates:
- ""HOUSE"" – but H is less common.
- ""POSE"" – too short.
- ""POSED"" – too long.
- ""SPOKE"" – has R? No, K is fine, but P is okay.
- ""SOOTH"" – has two O's, but we don't know about double letters yet.
- ""STEVE"" – V is okay, but we don't know about S position.

""HOUSE"" seems decent:
- H, O, U, S, E.
- O is 4th ✓
- S is 3rd (not 4th) ✓
- E is 5th (but feedback says E is in word but not 5th) → conflict. So HOUSE is invalid.

Let's process the new feedback from STENO:

S(-)  → S is in the word but not in position 1.  
T(-)  → T is in the word but not in position 2.  
E(-)  → E is in the word but not in position 3.  
N(x)  → N is NOT in the word.  
O(-)  → O is in the word but not in position 5.  

Combining with the earlier feedback from AROSE:
- O must be in position 4 (from arose: O(✓)).
- S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4 because O is in 4, so positions 2, 3, or 5).
- E must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 5, so positions 1, 2, or 4).
- A and R are out.
- N is out.

So the word has:
- 4th letter O.
- S somewhere in 2, 3, or 5.
- E somewhere in 1, 2, or 4 (but 4 is O, so positions 1 or 2).

Possible patterns:
- _ E _ O S  (E in 2, S in 5)
- E _ _ O S  (E in 1, S in 5)
- _ S E O _  (S in 2, E in 4 but 4 is O, invalid)
- _ _ S O E  (S in 3, E in 5 but E cannot be 5)
- _ E S O _  (E in 2, S in 3)
- E S _ O _  (E in 1, S in 2)

Valid patterns:
1. _ E _ O S
2. E _ _ O S
3. _ E S O _

Let's think of words fitting these patterns:

1. _ E _ O S:
   - BEGOS – not a valid word.
   - FELOS – not valid.
   - PEKOS – not valid.
   - SEPOS – not valid.
   - TELOS – not valid.

2. E _ _ O S:
   - ELOPS – not valid.
   - EPODS – too long.
   - ERODS – R is out.
   - EXPOS – X is okay, but EXPOS is 5 letters.
   - EPODS – invalid.

3. _ E S O _:
   - BESES – not valid.
   - FESES – not valid.
   - PESES – not valid.
   - SESES – not valid.
   - TESES – not valid.

Hmm, none of these seem to work. Let me reconsider.

Wait, the feedback from STENO says O is in the word but not in position 5, but from AROSE we know O is in position 4. So O is fixed at 4.

So the word is _ _ _ O _ with:
- S in 2, 3, or 5
- E in 1 or 2 (since 3 and 5 are invalid for E)
- No A, R, N

Let's try:

- _ E S O _ (E in 2, S in 3)
  - BESES – invalid
  - FESES – invalid
  - PESES – invalid
  - SESES – invalid
  - TESES – invalid

- _ _ S O E (but E can't be 5)
- _ E _ O S:
  - BEGOS – invalid
  - FELOS – invalid
  - PEKOS – invalid
  - SEPOS – invalid
  - TELOS – invalid

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's list possible words with O in 4th position, containing S and E, no A or R, no N.

Possible words:
- BEGOT – but no S
- BELLS – no O
- BESOM – O in 4, has B E S O M – but M is okay
  - B E S O M – positions: B(1), E(2), S(3), O(4), M(5)
  - Check feedback:
    - S is in word, not in 1 or 4 – here S is 3 ✓
    - E is in word, not in 3 or 5 – here E is 2 ✓
    - O is 4 ✓
    - No A, R, N ✓
    - B and M are new letters, but that's fine.

BESOM seems valid.

Let me verify:
B E S O M
- B: new
- E: in word, not 5 ✓
- S: in word, not 1 or 4 ✓
- O: 4 ✓
- M: new

This fits all constraints.

So the word is _ _ _ O _ with:
- S in 2, 3, or 5
- E in 1 or 2 (since 3 and 5 are invalid for E)
- No A, R, N

Let's try:

- _ E S O _ (E in 2, S in 3)
  - BESES – invalid
  - FESES – invalid
  - PESES – invalid
  - SESES – invalid
  - TESES – invalid

- _ _ S O E (but E can't be 5)
- _ E _ O S:
  - BEGOS – invalid
  - FELOS – invalid
  - PEKOS – invalid
  - SEPOS – invalid
  - TELOS – invalid

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's list possible words with O in 4th position, containing S and E, no A or R, no N.

Possible words:
- BEGOT – but no S
- BELLS – no O
- BESOM – O in 4, has B E S O M – but M is okay
  - B E S O M – positions: B(1), E(2), S(3), O(4), M(5)
  - Check feedback:
    - S is in word, not in 1 or 4 – here S is 3 ✓
    - E is in word, not in 3 or 5 – here E is 2 ✓
    - O is 4 ✓
    - No A, R, N ✓
    - B and M are new letters, but that's fine.

BESOM seems valid.

Let me verify:
B E S O M
- B: new
- E: in word, not 5 ✓
- S: in word, not 1 or 4 ✓
- O: 4 ✓
- M: new

This fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, L, N, etc. 

After considering various options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions quickly.
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S).
3. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words, giving good coverage for potential feedback.

This should provide useful information about which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the correct position (4th letter).
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- A and R are not in the word at all.

So we need a word that:
- Has O in the 4th position.
- Contains S somewhere other than 4th.
- Contains E somewhere other than 5th.
- Does not contain A or R.

Possible structure: _ _ _ O _ with S and E somewhere else.

Good candidates:
- ""HOUSE"" – but H is less common.
- ""POSE"" – too short.
- ""POSED"" – too long.
- ""SPOKE"" – has R? No, K is fine, but P is okay.
- ""SOOTH"" – has two O's, but we don't know about double letters yet.
- ""STEVE"" – V is okay, but we don't know about S position.

""HOUSE"" seems decent:
- H, O, U, S, E.
- O is 4th ✓
- S is 3rd (not 4th) ✓
- E is 5th (but feedback says E is in word but not 5th) → conflict. So HOUSE is invalid.

""SPOKE"":
- S P O K E
- O is 3rd (but feedback says O is 4th) → conflict.

""SOOTH"":
- S O O T H
- O is 2nd (but feedback says O is 4th) → conflict.

""STOLE"":
- S T O L E
- O is 3rd → conflict.

""OCEAN"" – doesn't have S or E.

""POSED"" – too long.

""SEWED"" – too long.

""SOLED"" – too long.

""STEEL"" – no O.

""STENO"" – O is 4th, S is 1st, E is 2nd.
- S T E N O
- O is 4th ✓
- S is 1st (not 4th) ✓
- E is 2nd (not 5th) ✓
- No A or R ✓
- All letters valid.

This seems perfect.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: steno -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) N(x) O(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's process the new feedback from STENO:

S(-)  → S is in the word but not in position 1.  
T(-)  → T is in the word but not in position 2.  
E(-)  → E is in the word but not in position 3.  
N(x)  → N is NOT in the word.  
O(-)  → O is in the word but not in position 5.  

Combining with the earlier feedback from AROSE:
- O must be in position 4 (from arose: O(✓)).
- S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4 because O is in 4, so positions 2, 3, or 5).
- E must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 5, so positions 1, 2, or 4).
- A and R are out.
- N is out.

So the word has:
- 4th letter O.
- S somewhere in 2, 3, or 5.
- E somewhere in 1, 2, or 4 (but 4 is O, so positions 1 or 2).

Possible patterns:
- _ E _ O S  (E in 2, S in 5)
- E _ _ O S  (E in 1, S in 5)
- _ S E O _  (S in 2, E in 4 but 4 is O, invalid)
- _ _ S O E  (S in 3, E in 5 but E cannot be 5)
- _ E S O _  (E in 2, S in 3)
- E S _ O _  (E in 1, S in 2)

Valid patterns:
1. _ E _ O S
2. E _ _ O S
3. _ E S O _

Let's think of words fitting these patterns:

1. _ E _ O S:
   - BEGOS – not a valid word.
   - FELOS – not valid.
   - PEKOS – not valid.
   - SEPOS – not valid.
   - TELOS – not valid.

2. E _ _ O S:
   - ELOPS – not valid.
   - EPODS – too long.
   - ERODS – R is out.
   - EXPOS – X is okay, but EXPOS is 5 letters.
   - EPODS – invalid.

3. _ E S O _:
   - BESES – not valid.
   - FESES – not valid.
   - PESES – not valid.
   - SESES – not valid.
   - TESES – not valid.

Let's consolidate all the information we have so far.

Known facts:
1. O is in the word and is in position 4 (from arose: O(✓)).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from arose: S(-) and besom: S(-)).
   - Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.
3. E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from arose: E(-) and besom: E(-)).
   - Therefore E must be in position 1 or 4. But position 4 is O, so E must be in position 1.
4. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, N, B, M.
5. The word structure is: E _ _ O _ (with S in 2 or 5).

Now we need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that:
- Are not A, R, N, B, M
- Are not already used (S, E, O)

Possible letters left: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know from guess 2 (steno) that T is in the word but not in position 2. Since position 2 is either S or (if S is in 5) some other letter, and T is in the word, we need to place T somewhere.

Let's consider the two cases for S:

Case 1: S in position 2
Word structure: E S _ O _
We need a letter for position 3 that is not A, R, N, B, M, and we also know from steno that T is in the word but not in position 2. Since position 2 is S, T must be in position 3 or 5.
- If T is in 3: E S T O _ → need a letter for 5 that is not A, R, N, B, M, and not S, E, O, T.
  Possible letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
  Possible words: E S T O C, E S T O D, etc. Let's think of real words.
  - ESTOC – not a valid word.
  - ESTON – N is out.
  - ESTOP – P is okay, but ESTOP is 5 letters.
  - ESTOW – W is okay.
  - ESTOS – S is already used in 2, and S can't be in 5 (from arose: S(-)), but actually arose only said S is not in 4, so S could be in 5. Wait, arose said S(-) meaning not in 1 or 4. So S could be in 2,3,5. But in this case S is in 2, so 5 is open.
  - ESTOS – S is in 5, but S is already in 2, so no double S.
  - ESTOP – valid word.
  - ESTOW – valid word.

Case 2: S in position 5

We need letters for positions 2 and 3 that are not A, R, N, B, M, and T must be in the word but not in position 2 (from steno: T(-)).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, L, N, etc. 

After considering various options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions quickly.
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S).
3. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words, giving good coverage for potential feedback.

This should provide useful information about which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the correct position (4th letter).
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- A and R are not in the word at all.

So we need a word that:
- Has O in the 4th position.
- Contains S somewhere other than 4th.
- Contains E somewhere other than 5th.
- Does not contain A or R.

Possible structure: _ _ _ O _ with S and E somewhere else.

Good candidates:
- ""HOUSE"" – but H is less common.
- ""POSE"" – too short.
- ""POSED"" – too long.
- ""SPOKE"" – has R? No, K is fine, but P is okay.
- ""SOOTH"" – has two O's, but we don't know about double letters yet.
- ""STEVE"" – V is okay, but we don't know about S position.

""HOUSE"" seems decent:
- H, O, U, S, E.
- O is 4th ✓
- S is 3rd (not 4th) ✓
- E is 5th (but feedback says E is in word but not 5th) → conflict. So HOUSE is invalid.

""SPOKE"":
- S P O K E
- O is 3rd (but feedback says O is 4th) → conflict.

""SOOTH"":
- S O O T H
- O is 2nd (but feedback says O is 4th) → conflict.

""STOLE"":
- S T O L E
- O is 3rd → conflict.

""OCEAN"" – doesn't have S or E.

""POSED"" – too long.

""SEWED"" – too long.

""SOLED"" – too long.

""STEEL"" – no O.

""STENO"" – O is 4th, S is 1st, E is 2nd.
- S T E N O
- O is 4th ✓
- S is 1st (not 4th) ✓
- E is 2nd (not 5th) ✓
- No A or R ✓
- All letters valid.

This seems perfect.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: steno -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) N(x) O(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's process the new feedback from STENO:

S(-)  → S is in the word but not in position 1.  
T(-)  → T is in the word but not in position 2.  
E(-)  → E is in the word but not in position 3.  
N(x)  → N is NOT in the word.  
O(-)  → O is in the word but not in position 5.  

Combining with the earlier feedback from AROSE:
- O must be in position 4 (from arose: O(✓)).
- S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4 because O is in 4, so positions 2, 3, or 5).
- E must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 5, so positions 1, 2, or 4).
- A and R are out.
- N is out.

So the word has:
- 4th letter O.
- S somewhere in 2, 3, or 5.
- E somewhere in 1, 2, or 4 (but 4 is O, so positions 1 or 2).

Possible patterns:
- _ E _ O S  (E in 2, S in 5)
- E _ _ O S  (E in 1, S in 5)
- _ S E O _  (S in 2, E in 4 but 4 is O, invalid)
- _ _ S O E  (S in 3, E in 5 but E cannot be 5)
- _ E S O _  (E in 2, S in 3)
- E S _ O _  (E in 1, S in 2)

Valid patterns:
1. _ E _ O S
2. E _ _ O S
3. _ E S O _

Let's think of words fitting these patterns:

1. _ E _ O S:
   - BEGOS – not a valid word.
   - FELOS – not valid.
   - PEKOS – not valid.
   - SEPOS – not valid.
   - TELOS – not valid.

2. E _ _ O S:
   - ELOPS – not valid.
   - EPODS – too long.
   - ERODS – R is out.
   - EXPOS – X is okay, but EXPOS is 5 letters.
   - EPODS – invalid.

3. _ E S O _:
   - BESES – not valid.
   - FESES – not valid.
   - PESES – not valid.
   - SESES – not valid.
   - TESES – not valid.

Hmm, none of these seem to work. Let me reconsider.

Wait, the feedback from STENO says O is in the word but not in position 5, but from AROSE we know O is in position 4. So O is fixed at 4.

So the word is _ _ _ O _ with:
- S in 2, 3, or 5
- E in 1 or 2 (since 3 and 5 are invalid for E)
- No A, R, N

Let's try:

- _ E S O _ (E in 2, S in 3)
  - BESES – invalid
  - FESES – invalid
  - PESES – invalid
  - SESES – invalid
  - TESES – invalid

- _ _ S O E (but E can't be 5)
- _ E _ O S:
  - BEGOS – invalid
  - FELOS – invalid
  - PEKOS – invalid
  - SEPOS – invalid
  - TELOS – invalid

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's list possible words with O in 4th position, containing S and E, no A or R, no N.

Possible words:
- BEGOT – but no S
- BELLS – no O
- BESOM – O in 4, has B E S O M – but M is okay
  - B E S O M – positions: B(1), E(2), S(3), O(4), M(5)
  - Check feedback:
    - S is in word, not in 1 or 4 – here S is 3 ✓
    - E is in word, not in 3 or 5 – here E is 2 ✓
    - O is 4 ✓
    - No A, R, N ✓
    - B and M are new letters, but that's fine.

BESOM seems valid.

Let me verify:
B E S O M
- B: new
- E: in word, not 5 ✓
- S: in word, not 1 or 4 ✓
- O: 4 ✓
- M: new

This fits all constraints.

Guess 3: besom -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) S(-) O(-) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's consolidate all the information we have so far.

Known facts:
1. O is in the word and is in position 4 (from arose: O(✓)).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from arose: S(-) and besom: S(-)).
   - Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.
3. E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from arose: E(-) and besom: E(-)).
   - Therefore E must be in position 1 or 4. But position 4 is O, so E must be in position 1.
4. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, N, B, M.
5. The word structure is: E _ _ O _ (with S in 2 or 5).

Now we need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that:
- Are not A, R, N, B, M
- Are not already used (S, E, O)

Possible letters left: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know from guess 2 (steno) that T is in the word but not in position 2. Since position 2 is either S or (if S is in 5) some other letter, and T is in the word, we need to place T somewhere.

Let's consider the two cases for S:

Case 1: S in position 2
Word structure: E S _ O _
We need a letter for position 3 that is not A, R, N, B, M, and we also know from steno that T is in the word but not in position 2. Since position 2 is S, T must be in position 3 or 5.
- If T is in 3: E S T O _ → need a letter for 5 that is not A, R, N, B, M, and not S, E, O, T.
  Possible letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
  Possible words: E S T O C, E S T O D, etc. Let's think of real words.
  - ESTOC – not a valid word.
  - ESTON – N is out.
  - ESTOP – P is okay, but ESTOP is 5 letters.
  - ESTOW – W is okay.
  - ESTOS – S is already used in 2, and S can't be in 5 (from arose: S(-)), but actually arose only said S is not in 4, so S could be in 5. Wait, arose said S(-) meaning not in 1 or 4. So S could be in 2,3,5. But in this case S is in 2, so 5 is open.
  - ESTOS – S is in 5, but S is already in 2, so no double S.
  - ESTOP – valid word.
  - ESTOW – valid word.

Case 2: S in position 5
Word structure: E _ _ O S
We need letters for positions 2 and 3 that are not A, R, N, B, M, and T must be in the word but not in position 2 (from steno: T(-)).
- T must be in position 3.
Word structure: E _ T O S
Need a letter for position 2 that is not A, R, N, B, M, and not E, O, T, S.
Possible letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible words:
- E C T O S – C is okay, but ECTOS is not a valid word.
- E D T O S – not valid.
- E F T O S – not valid.
- E G T O S – not valid.
- E H T O S – not valid.
- E L T O S – not valid.
- E P T O S – not valid.
- E V T O S – not valid.
- E W T O S – not valid.
- E Y T O S – not valid.

It seems the only plausible words are from Case 1: ESTOP or ESTOW.

Between these, ESTOP (E-S-T-O-P) and ESTOW (E-S-T-O-W) are both valid. Let's choose one.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, L, N, etc. 

After considering various options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions quickly.
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S).
3. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words, giving good coverage for potential feedback.

This should provide useful information about which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the correct position (4th letter).
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- A and R are not in the word at all.

So we need a word that:
- Has O in the 4th position.
- Contains S somewhere other than 4th.
- Contains E somewhere other than 5th.
- Does not contain A or R.

Possible structure: _ _ _ O _ with S and E somewhere else.

Good candidates:
- ""HOUSE"" – but H is less common.
- ""POSE"" – too short.
- ""POSED"" – too long.
- ""SPOKE"" – has R? No, K is fine, but P is okay.
- ""SOOTH"" – has two O's, but we don't know about double letters yet.
- ""STEVE"" – V is okay, but we don't know about S position.

""HOUSE"" seems decent:
- H, O, U, S, E.
- O is 4th ✓
- S is 3rd (not 4th) ✓
- E is 5th (but feedback says E is in word but not 5th) → conflict. So HOUSE is invalid.

""SPOKE"":
- S P O K E
- O is 3rd (but feedback says O is 4th) → conflict.

""SOOTH"":
- S O O T H
- O is 2nd (but feedback says O is 4th) → conflict.

""STOLE"":
- S T O L E
- O is 3rd → conflict.

""OCEAN"" – doesn't have S or E.

""POSED"" – too long.

""SEWED"" – too long.

""SOLED"" – too long.

""STEEL"" – no O.

""STENO"" – O is 4th, S is 1st, E is 2nd.
- S T E N O
- O is 4th ✓
- S is 1st (not 4th) ✓
- E is 2nd (not 5th) ✓
- No A or R ✓
- All letters valid.

This seems perfect.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: steno -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) N(x) O(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's process the new feedback from STENO:

S(-)  → S is in the word but not in position 1.  
T(-)  → T is in the word but not in position 2.  
E(-)  → E is in the word but not in position 3.  
N(x)  → N is NOT in the word.  
O(-)  → O is in the word but not in position 5.  

Combining with the earlier feedback from AROSE:
- O must be in position 4 (from arose: O(✓)).
- S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4 because O is in 4, so positions 2, 3, or 5).
- E must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 5, so positions 1, 2, or 4).
- A and R are out.
- N is out.

So the word has:
- 4th letter O.
- S somewhere in 2, 3, or 5.
- E somewhere in 1, 2, or 4 (but 4 is O, so positions 1 or 2).

Possible patterns:
- _ E _ O S  (E in 2, S in 5)
- E _ _ O S  (E in 1, S in 5)
- _ S E O _  (S in 2, E in 4 but 4 is O, invalid)
- _ _ S O E  (S in 3, E in 5 but E cannot be 5)
- _ E S O _  (E in 2, S in 3)
- E S _ O _  (E in 1, S in 2)

Valid patterns:
1. _ E _ O S
2. E _ _ O S
3. _ E S O _

Let's think of words fitting these patterns:

1. _ E _ O S:
   - BEGOS – not a valid word.
   - FELOS – not valid.
   - PEKOS – not valid.
   - SEPOS – not valid.
   - TELOS – not valid.

2. E _ _ O S:
   - ELOPS – not valid.
   - EPODS – too long.
   - ERODS – R is out.
   - EXPOS – X is okay, but EXPOS is 5 letters.
   - EPODS – invalid.

3. _ E S O _:
   - BESES – not valid.
   - FESES – not valid.
   - PESES – not valid.
   - SESES – not valid.
   - TESES – not valid.

Hmm, none of these seem to work. Let me reconsider.

Wait, the feedback from STENO says O is in the word but not in position 5, but from AROSE we know O is in position 4. So O is fixed at 4.

So the word is _ _ _ O _ with:
- S in 2, 3, or 5
- E in 1 or 2 (since 3 and 5 are invalid for E)
- No A, R, N

Let's try:

- _ E S O _ (E in 2, S in 3)
  - BESES – invalid
  - FESES – invalid
  - PESES – invalid
  - SESES – invalid
  - TESES – invalid

- _ _ S O E (but E can't be 5)
- _ E _ O S:
  - BEGOS – invalid
  - FELOS – invalid
  - PEKOS – invalid
  - SEPOS – invalid
  - TELOS – invalid

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's list possible words with O in 4th position, containing S and E, no A or R, no N.

Possible words:
- BEGOT – but no S
- BELLS – no O
- BESOM – O in 4, has B E S O M – but M is okay
  - B E S O M – positions: B(1), E(2), S(3), O(4), M(5)
  - Check feedback:
    - S is in word, not in 1 or 4 – here S is 3 ✓
    - E is in word, not in 3 or 5 – here E is 2 ✓
    - O is 4 ✓
    - No A, R, N ✓
    - B and M are new letters, but that's fine.

BESOM seems valid.

Let me verify:
B E S O M
- B: new
- E: in word, not 5 ✓
- S: in word, not 1 or 4 ✓
- O: 4 ✓
- M: new

This fits all constraints.

<|im_end|>

Let's consolidate all the information we have so far.

Known facts:
1. O is in the word and is in position 4 (from arose: O(✓)).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from arose: S(-) and besom: S(-)).
   - Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.
3. E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from arose: E(-) and besom: E(-)).
   - Therefore E must be in position 1 or 4. But position 4 is O, so E must be in position 1.
4. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, N, B, M.
5. The word structure is: E _ _ O _ (with S in 2 or 5).

Now we need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that:
- Are not A, R, N, B, M
- Are not already used (S, E, O)

Possible letters left: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know from guess 2 (steno) that T is in the word but not in position 2. Since position 2 is either S or (if S is in 5) some other letter, and T is in the word, we need to place T somewhere.

Let's consider the two cases for S:

Case 1: S in position 2
Word structure: E S _ O _
We need a letter for position 3 that is not A, R, N, B, M, and we also know from steno that T is in the word but not in position 2. Since position 2 is S, T must be in position 3 or 5.
- If T is in 3: E S T O _ → need a letter for 5 that is not A, R, N, B, M, and not S, E, O, T.
  Possible letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
  Possible words: E S T O C, E S T O D, etc. Let's think of real words.
  - ESTOC – not a valid word.
  - ESTON – N is out.
  - ESTOP – P is okay, but ESTOP is 5 letters.
  - ESTOW – W is okay.
  - ESTOS – S is already used in 2, and S can't be in 5 (from arose: S(-)), but actually arose only said S is not in 4, so S could be in 5. Wait, arose said S(-) meaning not in 1 or 4. So S could be in 2,3,5. But in this case S is in 2, so 5 is open.
  - ESTOS – S is in 5, but S is already in 2, so no double S.
  - ESTOP – valid word.
  - ESTOW – valid word.

Case 2: S in position 5
Word structure: E _ _ O S
We need letters for positions 2 and 3 that are not A, R, N, B, M, and T must be in the word but not in position 2 (from steno: T(-)).
- T must be in position 3.
Word structure: E _ T O S
Need a letter for position 2 that is not A, R, N, B, M, and not E, O, T, S.
Possible letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible words:
- E C T O S – C is okay, but ECTOS is not a valid word.
- E D T O S – not valid.
- E F T O S – not valid.
- E G T O S – not valid.
- E H T O S – not valid.
- E L T O S – not valid.
- E P T O S – not valid.
- E V T O S – not valid.
- E W T O S – not valid.
- E Y T O S – not valid.

It seems the only plausible words are from Case 1: ESTOP or ESTOW.

Between these, ESTOP (E-S-T-O-P) and ESTOW (E-S-T-O-W) are both valid. Let's choose one.

Consolidating every clue:

1. O is in position 4 (✓ from arose).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from arose, besom, estop, escot).  
   Therefore S must be in position 2.
3. E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from arose, besom, estop, escot).  
   Therefore E must be in position 1.
4. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, N, B, M, P, C.
5. Word structure: E S _ O _

From guess 5 (escot) we learned:
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from escot: T(-)).
- Since S is in 2 and O in 4, T must be in position 3.

So the word is: E S T O _

We need a 5th letter not in {A, R, N, B, M, P, C, E, S, T, O}.  
Valid remaining letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
