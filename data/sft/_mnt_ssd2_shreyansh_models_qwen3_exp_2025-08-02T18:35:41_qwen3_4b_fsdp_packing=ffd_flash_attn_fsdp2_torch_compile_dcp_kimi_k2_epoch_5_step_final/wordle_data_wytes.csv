For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently
- All letters are among the most common in 5-letter words

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Letters known to be in the word: E, S, T  
Letters known to be absent: A, R, O, I, N, H, X

Remaining common letters we haven't used yet: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with ""ES"".
- Contains T somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since T is in the word but not in position 2 from STEIN).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible words:
- TUBES: but U is allowed, B is allowed. However, we already have E and S fixed at positions 4 and 5, so TUBES would be T U B E S. This fits: T in position 1, U and B new, E and S fixed.
- BETES: but B is allowed, E and S fixed, T in position 3. This is valid too.
- METES: M, E, T, E, S. E and S fixed, T in position 3. Valid.

Among these, ""TUBES"" seems like a good next guess because it introduces two new common letters (U and B) while satisfying all constraints.

Let me check:
- T in position 1 (allowed, since T is in the word but not in position 2).
- U and B are new letters.
- E and S are in their correct positions (4 and 5).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently
- All letters are among the most common in 5-letter words

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word
- R(x) → R is not in the word
- O(x) → O is not in the word
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O
- Does contain S and E, but S is not 4th and E is not 5th

Next guess should:
1. Include S and E in different positions
2. Avoid A, R, O
3. Introduce other common consonants and vowels

A good candidate is ""STEIN"":
- S in 1st position (new position)
- T, E, I, N are all new letters
- E is now in 3rd position (different from 5th)
- No A, R, O
- Common letters T, I, N

Let's consolidate the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: S, E

2. STEIN → S(-) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: I, N (added to A, R, O)
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: S (already known), T, E (already known)

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but:
  – S is not in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and STEIN)
  – E is not in position 5 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 (from STEIN)
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, I, N

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
- Uses S and E in new positions (S not 1 or 4, E not 3 or 5)
- Avoids all forbidden letters
- Uses new common consonants

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4

Let’s try to build a word:
- If we place S in position 2, E could be in 1, 4
- If we place S in position 3, E could be in 1, 2, 4
- If we place S in position 5, E could be in 1, 2, 4

A promising candidate is ""HEXES"":
- H (new letter)
- E (position 2, new for E)
- X (new letter)
- E (position 4, new for E)
- S (position 5, new for S)

This uses S in position 5 and E in positions 2 and 4, avoiding all forbidden positions and letters.

Let’s update the knowledge after Guess 4 (TUBES → T(-) U(x) B(x) E(✓) S(✓)).

Current facts:
- Word ends in “ES” (positions 4=E, 5=S).
- Letters in the word: E, S, T.
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, I, N, H, X, U, B.
- From TUBES feedback:
  – T is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 1).
  – U and B are not in the word (already knew that).

So T must be in position 2 or 3.

Remaining unused common consonants: C, D, F, G, L, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ES” that:
- Contains T in position 2 or 3.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns:
- _ T _ E S   (T in position 2)
- _ _ T E S   (T in position 3)

Let’s list candidate words:
- C T E S → no, needs 5 letters.
- F T E S → no.
- G T E S → no.
- L T E S → no.
- M T E S → no.
- P T E S → no.
- Y T E S → no.

For T in position 3:
- _ _ T E S
  – C O T E S → O is out.
  – F R O T E S → R, O out.
  – G R E E T S → R out.
  – L E T T E S → L is allowed, T is in position 3.  Letters: L, E, T, T, E, S.  But we already have E and S fixed at positions 4 and 5, so this would be L E T E S.  That’s valid.
  – P E T E S → P, E, T, E, S.  E and S fixed, T in position 3.  Valid.
  – Y E T E S → Y, E, T, E, S.  Valid.

Between L E T E S and P E T E S, both are valid.  I’ll choose P E T E S because P is a common letter and hasn’t been tested yet.

Check constraints:
- P: allowed (not in banned list).
- E: in position 2 (allowed, since E is only constrained to be in position 4).
- T: in position 3 (allowed, since T is only constrained not to be in position 1 or 2 from prior feedback).
- E: in position 4 (✓).

<guess>PETES</guess>",PETES,"Let’s update the knowledge after Guess 4 (TUBES → T(-) U(x) B(x) E(✓) S(✓)).

Current facts:
- Word ends in “ES” (positions 4=E, 5=S).
- Letters in the word: E, S, T.
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, I, N, H, X, U, B.
- From TUBES feedback:
  – T is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 1).
  – U and B are not in the word (already knew that).

So T must be in position 2 or 3.

Remaining unused common consonants: C, D, F, G, L, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ES” that:
- Contains T in position 2 or 3.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns:
- _ T _ E S   (T in position 2)
- _ _ T E S   (T in position 3)

Let’s list candidate words:
- C T E S → no, needs 5 letters.
- F T E S → no.
- G T E S → no.
- L T E S → no.
- M T E S → no.
- P T E S → no.
- Y T E S → no.

For T in position 3:
- _ _ T E S
  – C O T E S → O is out.
  – F R O T E S → R, O out.
  – G R E E T S → R out.
  – L E T T E S → L is allowed, T is in position 3.  Letters: L, E, T, T, E, S.  But we already have E and S fixed at positions 4 and 5, so this would be L E T E S.  That’s valid.
  – P E T E S → P, E, T, E, S.  E and S fixed, T in position 3.  Valid.
  – Y E T E S → Y, E, T, E, S.  Valid.

Between L E T E S and P E T E S, both are valid.  I’ll choose P E T E S because P is a common letter and hasn’t been tested yet.

Check constraints:
- P: allowed (not in banned list).
- E: in position 2 (allowed, since E is only constrained to be in position 4).
- T: in position 3 (allowed, since T is only constrained not to be in position 1 or 2 from prior feedback).
- E: in position 4 (✓).
- S: in position 5 (✓).

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently
- All letters are among the most common in 5-letter words

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word
- R(x) → R is not in the word
- O(x) → O is not in the word
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O
- Does contain S and E, but S is not 4th and E is not 5th

Next guess should:
1. Include S and E in different positions
2. Avoid A, R, O
3. Introduce other common consonants and vowels

A good candidate is ""STEIN"":
- S in 1st position (new position)
- T, E, I, N are all new letters
- E is now in 3rd position (different from 5th)
- No A, R, O
- Common letters T, I, N

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's consolidate the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: S, E

2. STEIN → S(-) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: I, N (added to A, R, O)
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: S (already known), T, E (already known)

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but:
  – S is not in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and STEIN)
  – E is not in position 5 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 (from STEIN)
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, I, N

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
- Uses S and E in new positions (S not 1 or 4, E not 3 or 5)
- Avoids all forbidden letters
- Uses new common consonants

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4

Let’s try to build a word:
- If we place S in position 2, E could be in 1, 4
- If we place S in position 3, E could be in 1, 2, 4
- If we place S in position 5, E could be in 1, 2, 4

A promising candidate is ""HEXES"":
- H (new letter)
- E (position 2, new for E)
- X (new letter)
- E (position 4, new for E)
- S (position 5, new for S)

This uses S in position 5 and E in positions 2 and 4, avoiding all forbidden positions and letters.

Guess 3: HEXES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(-) X(x) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's update what we now know after the third guess.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R, O are not in the word.
   - S and E are in the word but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.

2. STEIN → S(-) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)
   - I, N are not in the word.
   - S is not in position 1 (confirmed again).
   - T is in the word but not in position 2.

3. HEXES → H(x) E(-) X(x) E(✓) S(✓)
   - H, X are not in the word.
   - E is in position 4 (✓).
   - S is in position 5 (✓).

So the secret word ends with ""ES"" (positions 4 and 5 are E and S respectively).

Letters known to be in the word: E, S, T  
Letters known to be absent: A, R, O, I, N, H, X

Remaining common letters we haven't used yet: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with ""ES"".
- Contains T somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since T is in the word but not in position 2 from STEIN).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible words:
- TUBES: but U is allowed, B is allowed. However, we already have E and S fixed at positions 4 and 5, so TUBES would be T U B E S. This fits: T in position 1, U and B new, E and S fixed.
- BETES: but B is allowed, E and S fixed, T in position 3. This is valid too.
- METES: M, E, T, E, S. E and S fixed, T in position 3. Valid.
- PETES: P, E, T, E, S. Valid.

Among these, ""TUBES"" seems like a good next guess because it introduces two new common letters (U and B) while satisfying all constraints.

Let me check:
- T in position 1 (allowed, since T is in the word but not in position 2).
- U and B are new letters.
- E and S are in their correct positions (4 and 5).
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, I, N, H, X) are used.

Therefore, ""TUBES"" is a valid next guess.

- Word ends in “ES” (positions 4=E, 5=S).
- Letters in the word: E, S, T.
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, I, N, H, X, U, B.
- From TUBES feedback:
  – T is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 1).

So T must be in position 2 or 3.

Remaining unused common consonants: C, D, F, G, L, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ES” that:
- Contains T in position 2 or 3.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns:
- _ T _ E S   (T in position 2)
- _ _ T E S   (T in position 3)

Let’s list candidate words:
- C T E S → no, needs 5 letters.
- F T E S → no.
- G T E S → no.
- L T E S → no.
- M T E S → no.
- P T E S → no.
- Y T E S → no.

For T in position 3:
- _ _ T E S
  – C O T E S → O is out.
  – F R O T E S → R, O out.
  – G R E E T S → R out.
  – L E T T E S → L is allowed, T is in position 3.  Letters: L, E, T, T, E, S.  But we already have E and S fixed at positions 4 and 5, so this would be L E T E S.  That’s valid.
  – P E T E S → P, E, T, E, S.  E and S fixed, T in position 3.  Valid.
  – Y E T E S → Y, E, T, E, S.  Valid.

Between L E T E S and P E T E S, both are valid.  I’ll choose P E T E S because P is a common letter and hasn’t been tested yet.

Check constraints:
- P: allowed (not in banned list).
- E: in position 2 (allowed, since E is only constrained to be in position 4).
- T: in position 3 (allowed, since T is only constrained not to be in position 1 or 2 from prior feedback).

No banned letters are used.  This seems correct.

Let's update the knowledge after the fifth guess.

Known facts so far:
1. Word ends in “ES” (positions 4=E, 5=S).
2. Letters in the word: E, S, T.
3. Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, I, N, H, X, U, B, P.
4. From PETES feedback:
   – P(x) → P is not in the word (already knew).
   – E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 2 (it is already fixed in position 4, so this is consistent).
   – T(✓) → T is in position 3.
   – E(✓) → E is in position 4 (already known).
   – S(✓) → S is in position 5 (already known).

So the word has the fixed pattern:
_ _ T E S

We need a 5-letter word ending in “TES” with T in position 3 and E in position 4, and S in position 5. The first two letters must be chosen from the remaining unused letters that are not in the banned list.

Remaining unused common letters: C, D, F, G, L, M, Y, etc.

Possible combinations for positions 1 and 2:
- C and D → C D T E S → CDTES (not a valid word)
- C and L → C L T E S → CLTES (invalid)
- C and M → C M T E S → CMTES (invalid)
- C and F → C F T E S → CFTES (invalid)
- G and L → G L T E S → GLTES (invalid)
- L and E → L E T E S → LETES (invalid, E already used in position 4)
- M and E → M E T E S → METES (valid word)
- Y and E → Y E T E S → YETES (valid word)

Between METES and YETES:
- METES: M is allowed, E is allowed in position 2 (only position 4 is fixed for E).
- YETES: Y is allowed, E is allowed in position 2.

Both are valid, but METES is more common. Let's choose METES.

   – E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 2 (it is already fixed in position 4, so this is consistent).
   – T(✓) → T is in position 3.
   – E(✓) → E is in position 4 (already known).
   – S(✓) → S is in position 5 (already known).

So the word has the fixed pattern:
_ _ T E S

We need a 5-letter word ending in “TES” with T in position 3 and E in position 4, and S in position 5. The first two letters must be chosen from the remaining unused letters that are not in the banned list.

Remaining unused common letters: C, D, F, G, L, M, Y, etc.

Possible combinations for positions 1 and 2:
- C and D → C D T E S → CDTES (not a valid word)
- C and L → C L T E S → CLTES (invalid)
- C and M → C M T E S → CMTES (invalid)
- C and F → C F T E S → CFTES (invalid)
- G and L → G L T E S → GLTES (invalid)
- L and E → L E T E S → LETES (invalid, E already used in position 4)
- M and E → M E T E S → METES (valid word)
- Y and E → Y E T E S → YETES (valid word)

Between METES and YETES:
- METES: M is allowed, E is allowed in position 2 (only position 4 is fixed for E).
- YETES: Y is allowed, E is allowed in position 2.

Both are valid, but METES is more common. Let's choose METES.

Check constraints:
- M: allowed (not in banned list).
- E: in position 2 (allowed, only position 4 is fixed for E).
- T: in position 3 (✓).
- E: in position 4 (✓).
- S: in position 5 (✓).

No banned letters are used. This should be correct.",Guess 6: METES -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) T(✓) E(✓) S(✓),FAIL
