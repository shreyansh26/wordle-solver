For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O - heavy on vowels)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is a good balance of common consonants and vowels, giving us good coverage of frequently used letters in English words. It also includes S and T which are very common starting letters. This should help eliminate or confirm many letters early on.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters we have:
- E is fixed in position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from SLATE, RESON, SEWED).  
  The only remaining position for S is position 3.

Letters we know are NOT in the word at all:
L, A, T, R, O, N, W.

So the pattern so far is:
_ E S _ _

We still need to test two new letters for positions 1, 4, and 5, using only letters not yet ruled out.

Good fresh letters to try: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Keeps E in position 2.
- Places S in position 3 (the only spot left for it).
- Uses two new letters for the remaining blanks.

A simple, common word that fits is “MESSE”, but it repeats S, which we already know is present.  
A better choice is “CESSE” (archaic but valid), but we’d rather avoid archaic words.  
Another option is “HESIT”, but I and T are both untested and T is already ruled out.

A clean, modern word that fits is “MESSE” again (but double S), so instead let’s try “PESKY”:
- P (new)
- E (fixed)
- S (position 3)
- K (new)
- Y (new)

This tests three new letters while satisfying every constraint.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O - heavy on vowels)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is a good balance of common consonants and vowels, giving us good coverage of frequently used letters in English words. It also includes S and T which are very common starting letters. This should help eliminate or confirm many letters early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 1st, so it must be 2nd-5th).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 5th, so it must be 1st-4th).

We now know:
- Letters to exclude: L, A, T
- Letters to keep: S (not 1st), E (not 5th)

Next guess should:
1. Use S somewhere other than 1st position.
2. Use E somewhere other than 5th position.
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested (like R, N, D, C, etc.).

A good candidate is “RESON”:
- R (new), E (not 5th), S (not 1st), O (new), N (new).
- All letters are distinct and none are L, A, or T.
- It places S in 3rd and E in 2nd, satisfying the positional constraints from feedback.

- O is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, E (with E fixed at position 2).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: L, A, T, R, O, N.
- S must appear in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Next guess should:
1. Keep E in position 2.
2. Place S in one of the allowed positions (1, 4, or 5).
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested (like D, C, M, P, etc.).

A good candidate is “SEWED”:
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 2 (fixed).
- W (new letter).
- E (already known to be in word).
- D (new letter).

Let’s re-summarize everything we now know after four guesses.

Letters we have:
- E is fixed in position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from SLATE, RESON, SEWED, PESKY).  
  The only remaining position for S is position 3.

Letters we know are NOT in the word at all:
L, A, T, R, O, N, W, P, K, Y.

So the pattern is:
_ E S _ _

We still need to test positions 1, 4, and 5 using only letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining candidate letters (common ones): C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2.
- Has S in position 3.
- Uses only allowed letters in positions 1, 4, and 5.

Let’s list possible combinations:
- Position 1: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V
- Position 4: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V
- Position 5: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V

Looking for common words that fit _ E S _ _:

- CHOSE – but O is ruled out.
- HESIT – but I and T are allowed? T is ruled out.
- MESSY – Y is ruled out.
- FRESH – H and X are allowed, but we need to check if F, R, H, E, S fit constraints. R is ruled out.
- GUEST – U and T are allowed, but T is ruled out.
- CESSA – A is ruled out.
- HESSE – double S is fine, but E and S are already known.
- MESSY – Y is ruled out.
- VESSE – V and S are allowed, but S is already in position 3.
- HESSE – H and S are allowed, E is fixed.

Wait, let’s think systematically:
We need a word of the form ? E S ? ? using allowed letters.

Possible letters left: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V.

Let’s list possible combinations:
- C E S C ? – no common word.
- D E S K ? – K is ruled out.
- F E S T ? – T is ruled out.
- G E S T ? – T is ruled out.
- H E S ? ? – H E S E ? – H E S E D – but D is allowed. HESED is not a common word.
- I E S ? ? – no common words.
- M E S ? ? – M E S S ? – MESSY (Y ruled out), MESSA (A ruled out).
- U E S ? ? – no common words.
- V E S ? ? – V E S S ? – VESSE is obscure.

Looking at common words, the only plausible one seems to be “HESSE” (though rare), but let’s double-check.

Actually, let’s consider “MESSY” – but Y is ruled out.  
Next, “FESSE” – not a word.  
“CESSE” – archaic but valid.  
“HESSE” – valid (plural of hess, a unit of length in some systems).

But we want a common word.  
Another possibility: “VESSE” – not common.  
“GESSY” – Y ruled out.

Wait, let’s check “HESSE” – it’s valid (plural of hess).  
But we need to test new letters.  
Let’s try “HESSE”:
- H (new)
- E (fixed)
- S (position 3)
- S (already known to be in word)
- E (fixed)

This tests H in position 1 and S in position 4, but S is already fixed in position 3, so this might not be optimal.

Let me think of other combinations:
- C E S S ? – no.
- D E S S ? – no.
- F E S S ? – no.
- G E S S ? – no.
- H E S E ? – H E S E D (but D is allowed). HESED is not a word.
- M E S S ? – MESSY (Y ruled out).

Actually, the only valid word that fits _ E S _ _ with allowed letters seems to be “HESSE” or “CESSE”.  
Between these, “CESSE” is archaic, so “HESSE” might be better.

But let’s consider another angle: maybe the word has S in position 3 and another S elsewhere?  
But we know S is only in position 3.

Let me list all possible _ E S _ _ words with remaining letters:
Allowed letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V.

Possible words:
- CHOSE – O ruled out.
- FRESH – R ruled out.
- GUEST – T ruled out.
- HESSE – valid.
- MESSY – Y ruled out.
- VESSE – obscure.

Given the constraints, “HESSE” seems to be the only valid word left.  
However, let’s check if we missed any.

Another possibility: “D E S S ?” – no.  
“F E S S ?” – no.  
“G E S S ?” – no.  
“V E S S ?” – no.  
“M E S S ?” – no.

Thus, the only valid word fitting all constraints is “HESSE”.

But let me verify: H E S S E – positions:
1: H (new)
2: E (fixed)
3: S (fixed)
4: S (already known to be in word)
5: E (fixed)

This tests H in position 1 and confirms S in position 4 (which we already know is wrong because S must be in position 3).  
Wait, no – in this word S is in position 3 and 4, but we know S is only in position 3.  
Thus, “HESSE” is invalid because it places S in position 4 as well, which contradicts our earlier deduction that S must be in position 3 only.

Let me re-examine: our deduction was that S cannot be in positions 1,3,4,5 from the feedback, so S must be in position 3.  
Thus, the word must be _ E S _ _ with S only in position 3.

Looking for common words of the form ? E S ? ? with remaining letters:
Allowed letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V.

Possible words:
- CHASE – C, H, A, S, E – A ruled out.
- CHESS – C, H, E, S, S – S in 4 is invalid.
- CESSA – A ruled out.
- FESCO – O ruled out.
- FESSE – not a word.
- GESSE – not a word.
- HESSE – as above, S in 4 invalid.
- MESSY – Y ruled out.
- VESSE – not a word.

This suggests I may have missed a word.  
Let me think differently: perhaps the word is “HESSE” despite S in 4?  
But that would contradict our earlier deduction.

Rechecking deductions:
From SLATE: S(-) → not in position 1.
From RESON: S(-) → not in position 3.
From SEWED: S(-) → not in position 1.
From PESKY: S(-) → not in position 3.

Thus, S cannot be in positions 1 or 3.  
But this contradicts my earlier conclusion that S must be in position 3.  
Wait, let me re-express:

From SLATE: S(-) → not in position 1.
From RESON: S(-) → not in position 3.
From SEWED: S(-) → not in position 1.
From PESKY: S(-) → not in position 3.

Thus, S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3.  
Therefore, possible positions for S: 2, 4, 5.

But position 2 is E (fixed), so S must be in 4 or 5.

This changes everything!  
My earlier deduction was flawed – S is NOT fixed in position 3.

Let me re-summarize:

Letters we have:
- E is fixed in position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from SLATE, RESON, SEWED, PESKY).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5.

Letters we know are NOT in the word at all:
L, A, T, R, O, N, W, P, K, Y.

So the pattern is:
_ E _ _ S

We still need to test positions 1, 3, and 4 using only letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining candidate letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V.

Let’s list possible _ E _ _ S words:

- C E _ _ S – CEVUS? CEDAS? CEDAR? A ruled out.
- D E _ _ S – DEIMS? DEIMS is not a word.
- F E _ _ S – FEELS? L ruled out.

- M E _ _ S – MEETS? T ruled out.
- U E _ _ S – not common.
- V E _ _ S – VEXES – V, E, X, E, S – X is allowed.

Looking at VEXES:
- V (new)
- E (fixed)
- X (new)
- E (fixed)
- S (position 5, allowed)

This tests V and X while satisfying all constraints.

Let me check if there are better options:
- CEDAS – not a word.
- FEELS – L ruled out.
- GELDS – not a word.
- HEELS – L ruled out.
- VEXES – valid word.

Thus, the best next guess is VEXES.
</think>

After re-evaluating the feedback, we now know:
- E is fixed in position 2.
- S must be in position 5 (since it cannot be in 1, 3, or 4).
- Letters ruled out: L, A, T, R, O, N, W, P, K, Y.

The pattern is _ E _ _ S, and we need to test new letters in positions 1, 3, and 4.  
A valid common word fitting this pattern is VEXES.

<guess>VEXES</guess>",VEXES,"Let’s re-summarize everything we now know after four guesses.

Letters we have:
- E is fixed in position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from SLATE, RESON, SEWED, PESKY).  
  The only remaining position for S is position 3.

Letters we know are NOT in the word at all:
L, A, T, R, O, N, W, P, K, Y.

So the pattern is:
_ E S _ _

We still need to test positions 1, 4, and 5 using only letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining candidate letters (common ones): C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2.
- Has S in position 3.
- Uses only allowed letters in positions 1, 4, and 5.

Let’s list possible combinations:
- Position 1: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V
- Position 4: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V
- Position 5: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V

Looking for common words that fit _ E S _ _:

- CHOSE – but O is ruled out.
- HESIT – but I and T are allowed? T is ruled out.
- MESSY – Y is ruled out.
- FRESH – H and X are allowed, but we need to check if F, R, H, E, S fit constraints. R is ruled out.
- GUEST – U and T are allowed, but T is ruled out.
- CESSA – A is ruled out.
- HESSE – double S is fine, but E and S are already known.
- MESSY – Y is ruled out.
- VESSE – V and S are allowed, but S is already in position 3.
- HESSE – H and S are allowed, E is fixed.

Wait, let’s think systematically:
We need a word of the form ? E S ? ? using allowed letters.

Possible letters left: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V.

Let’s list possible combinations:
- C E S C ? – no common word.
- D E S K ? – K is ruled out.
- F E S T ? – T is ruled out.
- G E S T ? – T is ruled out.
- H E S ? ? – H E S E ? – H E S E D – but D is allowed. HESED is not a common word.
- I E S ? ? – no common words.
- M E S ? ? – M E S S ? – MESSY (Y ruled out), MESSA (A ruled out).
- U E S ? ? – no common words.
- V E S ? ? – V E S S ? – VESSE is obscure.

Looking at common words, the only plausible one seems to be “HESSE” (though rare), but let’s double-check.

Actually, let’s consider “MESSY” – but Y is ruled out.  
Next, “FESSE” – not a word.  
“CESSE” – archaic but valid.  
“HESSE” – valid (plural of hess, a unit of length in some systems).

But we want a common word.  
Another possibility: “VESSE” – not common.  
“GESSY” – Y ruled out.

Wait, let’s check “HESSE” – it’s valid (plural of hess).  
But we need to test new letters.  
Let’s try “HESSE”:
- H (new)
- E (fixed)
- S (position 3)
- S (already known to be in word)
- E (fixed)

This tests H in position 1 and S in position 4, but S is already fixed in position 3, so this might not be optimal.

Let me think of other combinations:
- C E S S ? – no.
- D E S S ? – no.
- F E S S ? – no.
- G E S S ? – no.
- H E S E ? – H E S E D (but D is allowed). HESED is not a word.
- M E S S ? – MESSY (Y ruled out).

Actually, the only valid word that fits _ E S _ _ with allowed letters seems to be “HESSE” or “CESSE”.  
Between these, “CESSE” is archaic, so “HESSE” might be better.

But let’s consider another angle: maybe the word has S in position 3 and another S elsewhere?  
But we know S is only in position 3.

Let me list all possible _ E S _ _ words with remaining letters:
Allowed letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V.

Possible words:
- CHOSE – O ruled out.
- FRESH – R ruled out.
- GUEST – T ruled out.
- HESSE – valid.
- MESSY – Y ruled out.
- VESSE – obscure.

Given the constraints, “HESSE” seems to be the only valid word left.  
However, let’s check if we missed any.

Another possibility: “D E S S ?” – no.  
“F E S S ?” – no.  
“G E S S ?” – no.  
“V E S S ?” – no.  
“M E S S ?” – no.

Thus, the only valid word fitting all constraints is “HESSE”.

But let me verify: H E S S E – positions:
1: H (new)
2: E (fixed)
3: S (fixed)
4: S (already known to be in word)
5: E (fixed)

This tests H in position 1 and confirms S in position 4 (which we already know is wrong because S must be in position 3).  
Wait, no – in this word S is in position 3 and 4, but we know S is only in position 3.  
Thus, “HESSE” is invalid because it places S in position 4 as well, which contradicts our earlier deduction that S must be in position 3 only.

Let me re-examine: our deduction was that S cannot be in positions 1,3,4,5 from the feedback, so S must be in position 3.  
Thus, the word must be _ E S _ _ with S only in position 3.

Looking for common words of the form ? E S ? ? with remaining letters:
Allowed letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V.

Possible words:
- CHASE – C, H, A, S, E – A ruled out.
- CHESS – C, H, E, S, S – S in 4 is invalid.
- CESSA – A ruled out.
- FESCO – O ruled out.
- FESSE – not a word.
- GESSE – not a word.
- HESSE – as above, S in 4 invalid.
- MESSY – Y ruled out.
- VESSE – not a word.

This suggests I may have missed a word.  
Let me think differently: perhaps the word is “HESSE” despite S in 4?  
But that would contradict our earlier deduction.

Rechecking deductions:
From SLATE: S(-) → not in position 1.
From RESON: S(-) → not in position 3.
From SEWED: S(-) → not in position 1.
From PESKY: S(-) → not in position 3.

Thus, S cannot be in positions 1 or 3.  
But this contradicts my earlier conclusion that S must be in position 3.  
Wait, let me re-express:

From SLATE: S(-) → not in position 1.
From RESON: S(-) → not in position 3.
From SEWED: S(-) → not in position 1.
From PESKY: S(-) → not in position 3.

Thus, S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3.  
Therefore, possible positions for S: 2, 4, 5.

But position 2 is E (fixed), so S must be in 4 or 5.

This changes everything!  
My earlier deduction was flawed – S is NOT fixed in position 3.

Let me re-summarize:

Letters we have:
- E is fixed in position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from SLATE, RESON, SEWED, PESKY).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5.

Letters we know are NOT in the word at all:
L, A, T, R, O, N, W, P, K, Y.

So the pattern is:
_ E _ _ S

We still need to test positions 1, 3, and 4 using only letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining candidate letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V.

Let’s list possible _ E _ _ S words:

- C E _ _ S – CEVUS? CEDAS? CEDAR? A ruled out.
- D E _ _ S – DEIMS? DEIMS is not a word.
- F E _ _ S – FEELS? L ruled out.
- G E _ _ S – GELDS? GELDS is not a word.
- H E _ _ S – HEELS? L ruled out.
- I E _ _ S – not common.
- M E _ _ S – MEETS? T ruled out.
- U E _ _ S – not common.
- V E _ _ S – VEXES – V, E, X, E, S – X is allowed.

Looking at VEXES:
- V (new)
- E (fixed)
- X (new)
- E (fixed)
- S (position 5, allowed)

This tests V and X while satisfying all constraints.

Let me check if there are better options:
- CEDAS – not a word.
- FEELS – L ruled out.
- GELDS – not a word.
- HEELS – L ruled out.
- VEXES – valid word.

Thus, the best next guess is VEXES.After re-evaluating the feedback, we now know:
- E is fixed in position 2.
- S must be in position 5 (since it cannot be in 1, 3, or 4).
- Letters ruled out: L, A, T, R, O, N, W, P, K, Y.

The pattern is _ E _ _ S, and we need to test new letters in positions 1, 3, and 4.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O - heavy on vowels)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is a good balance of common consonants and vowels, giving us good coverage of frequently used letters in English words. It also includes S and T which are very common starting letters. This should help eliminate or confirm many letters early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 1st, so it must be 2nd-5th).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 5th, so it must be 1st-4th).

We now know:
- Letters to exclude: L, A, T
- Letters to keep: S (not 1st), E (not 5th)

Next guess should:
1. Use S somewhere other than 1st position.
2. Use E somewhere other than 5th position.
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested (like R, N, D, C, etc.).

A good candidate is “RESON”:
- R (new), E (not 5th), S (not 1st), O (new), N (new).
- All letters are distinct and none are L, A, or T.
- It places S in 3rd and E in 2nd, satisfying the positional constraints from feedback.

Guess 2: RESON -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(✓) S(-) O(x) N(x)

From the new feedback on RESON:
- R is not in the word (x).
- E is in the correct position (2nd letter, ✓).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-). Since it was 3rd in RESON, it must be 1st, 4th, or 5th.
- O is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, E (with E fixed at position 2).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: L, A, T, R, O, N.
- S must appear in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Next guess should:
1. Keep E in position 2.
2. Place S in one of the allowed positions (1, 4, or 5).
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested (like D, C, M, P, etc.).

A good candidate is “SEWED”:
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 2 (fixed).
- W (new letter).
- E (already known to be in word).
- D (new letter).

This tests W and D while respecting all constraints.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters we have:
- E is fixed in position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from SLATE, RESON, SEWED).  
  The only remaining position for S is position 3.

Letters we know are NOT in the word at all:
L, A, T, R, O, N, W.

So the pattern so far is:
_ E S _ _

We still need to test two new letters for positions 1, 4, and 5, using only letters not yet ruled out.

Good fresh letters to try: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Keeps E in position 2.
- Places S in position 3 (the only spot left for it).
- Uses two new letters for the remaining blanks.

A simple, common word that fits is “MESSE”, but it repeats S, which we already know is present.  
A better choice is “CESSE” (archaic but valid), but we’d rather avoid archaic words.  
Another option is “HESIT”, but I and T are both untested and T is already ruled out.

A clean, modern word that fits is “MESSE” again (but double S), so instead let’s try “PESKY”:
- P (new)
- E (fixed)
- S (position 3)
- K (new)
- Y (new)

This tests three new letters while satisfying every constraint.

Let’s re-summarize everything we now know after four guesses.

Letters we have:
- E is fixed in position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from SLATE, RESON, SEWED, PESKY).  
  The only remaining position for S is position 3.

Letters we know are NOT in the word at all:
L, A, T, R, O, N, W, P, K, Y.

So the pattern is:
_ E S _ _

We still need to test positions 1, 4, and 5 using only letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining candidate letters (common ones): C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2.
- Has S in position 3.
- Uses only allowed letters in positions 1, 4, and 5.

Let’s list possible combinations:
- Position 1: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V
- Position 4: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V
- Position 5: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V

Looking for common words that fit _ E S _ _:

- CHOSE – but O is ruled out.
- HESIT – but I and T are allowed? T is ruled out.
- MESSY – Y is ruled out.
- FRESH – H and X are allowed, but we need to check if F, R, H, E, S fit constraints. R is ruled out.
- GUEST – U and T are allowed, but T is ruled out.
- CESSA – A is ruled out.
- HESSE – double S is fine, but E and S are already known.
- MESSY – Y is ruled out.
- VESSE – V and S are allowed, but S is already in position 3.
- HESSE – H and S are allowed, E is fixed.

Wait, let’s think systematically:
We need a word of the form ? E S ? ? using allowed letters.

Possible letters left: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V.

Let’s list possible combinations:
- C E S C ? – no common word.
- D E S K ? – K is ruled out.
- F E S T ? – T is ruled out.
- G E S T ? – T is ruled out.
- H E S ? ? – H E S E ? – H E S E D – but D is allowed. HESED is not a common word.
- I E S ? ? – no common words.
- M E S ? ? – M E S S ? – MESSY (Y ruled out), MESSA (A ruled out).
- U E S ? ? – no common words.
- V E S ? ? – V E S S ? – VESSE is obscure.

Looking at common words, the only plausible one seems to be “HESSE” (though rare), but let’s double-check.

Actually, let’s consider “MESSY” – but Y is ruled out.  
Next, “FESSE” – not a word.  
“CESSE” – archaic but valid.  
“HESSE” – valid (plural of hess, a unit of length in some systems).

But we want a common word.  
Another possibility: “VESSE” – not common.  
“GESSY” – Y ruled out.

Wait, let’s check “HESSE” – it’s valid (plural of hess).  
But we need to test new letters.  
Let’s try “HESSE”:
- H (new)
- E (fixed)
- S (position 3)
- S (already known to be in word)
- E (fixed)

This tests H in position 1 and S in position 4, but S is already fixed in position 3, so this might not be optimal.

Let me think of other combinations:
- C E S S ? – no.
- D E S S ? – no.
- F E S S ? – no.
- G E S S ? – no.
- H E S E ? – H E S E D (but D is allowed). HESED is not a word.
- M E S S ? – MESSY (Y ruled out).

Actually, the only valid word that fits _ E S _ _ with allowed letters seems to be “HESSE” or “CESSE”.  
Between these, “CESSE” is archaic, so “HESSE” might be better.

But let’s consider another angle: maybe the word has S in position 3 and another S elsewhere?  
But we know S is only in position 3.

Let me list all possible _ E S _ _ words with remaining letters:
Allowed letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V.

Possible words:
- CHOSE – O ruled out.
- FRESH – R ruled out.
- GUEST – T ruled out.
- HESSE – valid.
- MESSY – Y ruled out.
- VESSE – obscure.

Given the constraints, “HESSE” seems to be the only valid word left.  
However, let’s check if we missed any.

Another possibility: “D E S S ?” – no.  
“F E S S ?” – no.  
“G E S S ?” – no.  
“V E S S ?” – no.  
“M E S S ?” – no.

Thus, the only valid word fitting all constraints is “HESSE”.

But let me verify: H E S S E – positions:
1: H (new)
2: E (fixed)
3: S (fixed)
4: S (already known to be in word)
5: E (fixed)

This tests H in position 1 and confirms S in position 4 (which we already know is wrong because S must be in position 3).  
Wait, no – in this word S is in position 3 and 4, but we know S is only in position 3.  
Thus, “HESSE” is invalid because it places S in position 4 as well, which contradicts our earlier deduction that S must be in position 3 only.

Let me re-examine: our deduction was that S cannot be in positions 1,3,4,5 from the feedback, so S must be in position 3.  
Thus, the word must be _ E S _ _ with S only in position 3.

Looking for common words of the form ? E S ? ? with remaining letters:
Allowed letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V.

Possible words:
- CHASE – C, H, A, S, E – A ruled out.
- CHESS – C, H, E, S, S – S in 4 is invalid.
- CESSA – A ruled out.
- FESCO – O ruled out.
- FESSE – not a word.
- GESSE – not a word.
- HESSE – as above, S in 4 invalid.
- MESSY – Y ruled out.
- VESSE – not a word.

This suggests I may have missed a word.  
Let me think differently: perhaps the word is “HESSE” despite S in 4?  
But that would contradict our earlier deduction.

Rechecking deductions:
From SLATE: S(-) → not in position 1.
From RESON: S(-) → not in position 3.
From SEWED: S(-) → not in position 1.
From PESKY: S(-) → not in position 3.

Thus, S cannot be in positions 1 or 3.  
But this contradicts my earlier conclusion that S must be in position 3.  
Wait, let me re-express:

From SLATE: S(-) → not in position 1.
From RESON: S(-) → not in position 3.
From SEWED: S(-) → not in position 1.
From PESKY: S(-) → not in position 3.

Thus, S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3.  
Therefore, possible positions for S: 2, 4, 5.

But position 2 is E (fixed), so S must be in 4 or 5.

This changes everything!  
My earlier deduction was flawed – S is NOT fixed in position 3.

Let me re-summarize:

Letters we have:
- E is fixed in position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from SLATE, RESON, SEWED, PESKY).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5.

Letters we know are NOT in the word at all:
L, A, T, R, O, N, W, P, K, Y.

So the pattern is:
_ E _ _ S

We still need to test positions 1, 3, and 4 using only letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining candidate letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, U, V.

Let’s list possible _ E _ _ S words:

- C E _ _ S – CEVUS? CEDAS? CEDAR? A ruled out.
- D E _ _ S – DEIMS? DEIMS is not a word.
- F E _ _ S – FEELS? L ruled out.
- G E _ _ S – GELDS? GELDS is not a word.
- H E _ _ S – HEELS? L ruled out.
- I E _ _ S – not common.
- M E _ _ S – MEETS? T ruled out.
- U E _ _ S – not common.
- V E _ _ S – VEXES – V, E, X, E, S – X is allowed.

Looking at VEXES:
- V (new)
- E (fixed)
- X (new)
- E (fixed)
- S (position 5, allowed)

This tests V and X while satisfying all constraints.

Let me check if there are better options:
- CEDAS – not a word.
- FEELS – L ruled out.
- GELDS – not a word.
- HEELS – L ruled out.
- VEXES – valid word.

Thus, the best next guess is VEXES.After re-evaluating the feedback, we now know:
- E is fixed in position 2.
- S must be in position 5 (since it cannot be in 1, 3, or 4).
- Letters ruled out: L, A, T, R, O, N, W, P, K, Y.

The pattern is _ E _ _ S, and we need to test new letters in positions 1, 3, and 4.  
A valid common word fitting this pattern is VEXES.
