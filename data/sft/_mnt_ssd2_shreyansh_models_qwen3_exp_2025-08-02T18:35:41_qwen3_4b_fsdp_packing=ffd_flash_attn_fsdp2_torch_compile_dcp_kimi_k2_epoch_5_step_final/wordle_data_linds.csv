### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which aren't. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter early on, providing valuable information for subsequent guesses.

From the two previous guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – Eliminates A, R, O, E  
   – Confirms S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. stint → S(-) T(x) I(-) N(-) T(x)  
   – Eliminates T  
   – Confirms I is in the word but not in position 3  
   – Confirms N is in the word but not in position 4  
   – Confirms S is in the word but not in position 1  

So the secret word:
- Contains S, I, N (each in a different position than previously tried)  
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T  

Remaining common letters to try: U, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S, I, N exactly once each  
- Uses two other letters from the remaining pool  
- Places S not in position 1, I not in position 3, N not in position 4  

Let’s pick a word that re-uses S, I, N and introduces new common letters like U and L.  
A good candidate is “SUNIL”:
- S in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1 from the feedback) → reject  
Try “SULIN” – same issue with S in position 1.  

Next idea: place S in position 2 or 3 or 5.  
Try “INUS” – too short.  

Let’s try “SNIPS” – but we already know S is in the word, and we don’t know if P is allowed yet. Also double S might be risky.  

Better to keep S once and introduce new letters.  
Try “SULCI” – C is allowed, but U, L, C, S, I – but “SULCI” is obscure.  

Let’s try “SUNNY” – but N is already confirmed, and we don’t know if Y is allowed.  

Let’s try “SINGY” – G not yet tested, Y not yet tested.  

But we know N is not in position 4, so “SINGY” has N in position 3 – acceptable.  
Let’s check letters: S, I, N, G, Y.  
Eliminated letters so far: A, R, O, E, T.  
S, I, N are confirmed; G, Y are new.  

This seems valid.  

Another candidate: “SULCI” – but C is less common.  

“SINGY” seems the best choice.  

However, let me double-check:  
- S is in position 1 – but feedback says S is not in position 1 (from stint).  
Oops, reject.  

Next: move S to position 2.  
Try “USING” – U, S, I, N, G.  
- S in position 2 – allowed (not 1 or 4).  
- I in position 3 – but feedback says I is not in position 3 (from stint).  
Reject.  

Next: move S to position 3.  
Try “UNGIS” – obscure.  

Next: move S to position 5.  
Try “UNGIS” – again obscure.  

Let’s try “SULCI” – S in position 1 again – reject.  

Let’s try “SULCI” is invalid.  

Let’s try “SULCI” – no.

So S can be in 2, 3, or 5.  
I can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
N can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.  

Let’s pick S in position 2, I in position 1, N in position 3.  
Word: I S N _ _  
Need two more letters from remaining pool (U, L, C, D, M, P, etc.).  
Try “ISNUL” – not a word.  

Try “ISNIP” – P is new.  
Check letters: I, S, N, I, P – double I – invalid.  

Try “ISNED” – E is eliminated.  

Try “ISNUL” – invalid.  

Let’s try S in position 3, I in position 1, N in position 2.  
Word: I N S _ _  
Need two more letters.  
Try “INSUL” – valid word.  
Check letters: I, N, S, U, L.  
- S in position 3 – allowed (not 1 or 4).

- N in position 2 – allowed.  
- U and L are new letters not yet tested.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which aren't. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter early on, providing valuable information for subsequent guesses.

- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (not in position 4).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Good consonants to try next: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Let's pick a word that uses S in a different position and introduces new common letters. ""STINT"" uses S in position 1 and introduces T, I, N. This seems like a good next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: stint -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(-) N(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – Eliminates A, R, O, E  
   – Confirms S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. stint → S(-) T(x) I(-) N(-) T(x)  
   – Eliminates T  
   – Confirms I is in the word but not in position 3  
   – Confirms N is in the word but not in position 4  
   – Confirms S is in the word but not in position 1  

So the secret word:
- Contains S, I, N (each in a different position than previously tried)  
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T  

Remaining common letters to try: U, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S, I, N exactly once each  
- Uses two other letters from the remaining pool  
- Places S not in position 1, I not in position 3, N not in position 4  

Let’s pick a word that re-uses S, I, N and introduces new common letters like U and L.  
A good candidate is “SUNIL”:
- S in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1 from the feedback) → reject  
Try “SULIN” – same issue with S in position 1.  

Next idea: place S in position 2 or 3 or 5.  
Try “INUS” – too short.  

Let’s try “SNIPS” – but we already know S is in the word, and we don’t know if P is allowed yet. Also double S might be risky.  

Better to keep S once and introduce new letters.  
Try “SULCI” – C is allowed, but U, L, C, S, I – but “SULCI” is obscure.  

Let’s try “SUNNY” – but N is already confirmed, and we don’t know if Y is allowed.  

Let’s try “SINGY” – G not yet tested, Y not yet tested.  

But we know N is not in position 4, so “SINGY” has N in position 3 – acceptable.  
Let’s check letters: S, I, N, G, Y.  
Eliminated letters so far: A, R, O, E, T.  
S, I, N are confirmed; G, Y are new.  

This seems valid.  

Another candidate: “SULCI” – but C is less common.  

“SINGY” seems the best choice.  

However, let me double-check:  
- S is in position 1 – but feedback says S is not in position 1 (from stint).  
Oops, reject.  

Next: move S to position 2.  
Try “USING” – U, S, I, N, G.  
- S in position 2 – allowed (not 1 or 4).  
- I in position 3 – but feedback says I is not in position 3 (from stint).  
Reject.  

Next: move S to position 3.  
Try “UNGIS” – obscure.  

Next: move S to position 5.  
Try “UNGIS” – again obscure.  

Let’s try “SULCI” – S in position 1 again – reject.  

Let’s try “SULCI” is invalid.  

Let’s try “SULCI” – no.  

Let’s try “SULCI” – no.  

Let me think differently: list positions and constraints.

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters known to be in word: S, I, N  
Letters known NOT in word: A, R, O, E, T  
Positions ruled out:  
- S ≠ 1, 4  
- I ≠ 3  
- N ≠ 4  

So S can be in 2, 3, or 5.  
I can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
N can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.  

Let’s pick S in position 2, I in position 1, N in position 3.  
Word: I S N _ _  
Need two more letters from remaining pool (U, L, C, D, M, P, etc.).  
Try “ISNUL” – not a word.  

Try “ISNIP” – P is new.  
Check letters: I, S, N, I, P – double I – invalid.  

Try “ISNED” – E is eliminated.  

Try “ISNUL” – invalid.  

Let’s try S in position 3, I in position 1, N in position 2.  
Word: I N S _ _  
Need two more letters.  
Try “INSUL” – valid word.  
Check letters: I, N, S, U, L.  
- S in position 3 – allowed (not 1 or 4).  
- I in position 1 – allowed.  
- N in position 2 – allowed.  
- U and L are new letters not yet tested.  

This seems valid.  

Let’s go with “INSUL”.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which aren't. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter early on, providing valuable information for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (not in position 4).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Good consonants to try next: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Let's pick a word that uses S in a different position and introduces new common letters. ""STINT"" uses S in position 1 and introduces T, I, N. This seems like a good next guess.

<|im_end|>

From the two previous guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – Eliminates A, R, O, E  
   – Confirms S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. stint → S(-) T(x) I(-) N(-) T(x)  
   – Eliminates T  
   – Confirms I is in the word but not in position 3  
   – Confirms N is in the word but not in position 4  
   – Confirms S is in the word but not in position 1  

So the secret word:
- Contains S, I, N (each in a different position than previously tried)  
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T  

Remaining common letters to try: U, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S, I, N exactly once each  
- Uses two other letters from the remaining pool  
- Places S not in position 1, I not in position 3, N not in position 4  

Let’s pick a word that re-uses S, I, N and introduces new common letters like U and L.  
A good candidate is “SUNIL”:
- S in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1 from the feedback) → reject  
Try “SULIN” – same issue with S in position 1.  

Next idea: place S in position 2 or 3 or 5.  
Try “INUS” – too short.  

Let’s try “SNIPS” – but we already know S is in the word, and we don’t know if P is allowed yet. Also double S might be risky.  

Better to keep S once and introduce new letters.  
Try “SULCI” – C is allowed, but U, L, C, S, I – but “SULCI” is obscure.  

Let’s try “SUNNY” – but N is already confirmed, and we don’t know if Y is allowed.  

Let’s try “SINGY” – G not yet tested, Y not yet tested.  

But we know N is not in position 4, so “SINGY” has N in position 3 – acceptable.  
Let’s check letters: S, I, N, G, Y.  
Eliminated letters so far: A, R, O, E, T.  
S, I, N are confirmed; G, Y are new.  

This seems valid.  

Another candidate: “SULCI” – but C is less common.  

“SINGY” seems the best choice.  

However, let me double-check:  
- S is in position 1 – but feedback says S is not in position 1 (from stint).  
Oops, reject.  

Next: move S to position 2.  
Try “USING” – U, S, I, N, G.  
- S in position 2 – allowed (not 1 or 4).  
- I in position 3 – but feedback says I is not in position 3 (from stint).  
Reject.  

Next: move S to position 3.  
Try “UNGIS” – obscure.  

Next: move S to position 5.  
Try “UNGIS” – again obscure.  

Let’s try “SULCI” – S in position 1 again – reject.  

Let’s try “SULCI” is invalid.  

Let’s try “SULCI” – no.  

Let’s try “SULCI” – no.  

Let me think differently: list positions and constraints.

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters known to be in word: S, I, N  
Letters known NOT in word: A, R, O, E, T  
Positions ruled out:  
- S ≠ 1, 4  
- I ≠ 3  
- N ≠ 4  

So S can be in 2, 3, or 5.  
I can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
N can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.  

Let’s pick S in position 2, I in position 1, N in position 3.  
Word: I S N _ _  
Need two more letters from remaining pool (U, L, C, D, M, P, etc.).  
Try “ISNUL” – not a word.  

Try “ISNIP” – P is new.  
Check letters: I, S, N, I, P – double I – invalid.  

Try “ISNED” – E is eliminated.  

Try “ISNUL” – invalid.  

Let’s try S in position 3, I in position 1, N in position 2.  
Word: I N S _ _  
Need two more letters.  
Try “INSUL” – valid word.  
Check letters: I, N, S, U, L.  
- S in position 3 – allowed (not 1 or 4).  
- I in position 1 – allowed.  
- N in position 2 – allowed.  
- U and L are new letters not yet tested.  

This seems valid.  

Let’s go with “INSUL”.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word: S, I, N, L  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U  

Position constraints:
- S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4 (from guesses 1, 2, 3)  
  ⇒ S must be in position 2 or 5.
- I cannot be in positions 1, 3 (from guesses 2, 3)  
  ⇒ I must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- N cannot be in positions 2, 4 (from guesses 2, 3)  
  ⇒ N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- L cannot be in position 5 (from guess 3)  
  ⇒ L must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains exactly S, I, N, L once each, plus one more letter from the remaining unused pool (common unused letters: C, D, M, P, etc.).
- Respects all position constraints.

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: S in position 2  
Then word shape: _ S _ _ _  
Now place I, N, L in remaining positions (1,3,4,5) with constraints:
- I: 4,5 allowed (cannot be 1,3)  
- N: 1,3,5 allowed (cannot be 2,4)  
- L: 1,3,4 allowed (cannot be 5)  

Let’s try N in 1, I in 4, L in 3:

Need a 5th letter. Remaining unused letters: C, D, M, P, etc.  
Try “NSLIC” – not a word.  
Try “NSLID” – not a word.  
Try “NSLIM” – not a word.  
Try “NSLIP” – not a word.  
Try “NSLIT” – T is eliminated.  
Try “NSLIX” – X not common.  
No obvious valid word.

Case 2: S in position 5  
Then word shape: _ _ _ _ S  
Place I, N, L in positions 1-4 with constraints:
- I: 1,2,4 allowed (cannot be 3)  
- N: 1,3 allowed (cannot be 2,4,5)  
- L: 1,2,3,4 allowed (cannot be 5)  

Let’s try N in 1, I in 2, L in 3:  
Word: N I L _ S  
Need a 4th letter.  
Try “NILCS” – not a word.  
Try “NILDS” – not a word.  
Try “NILMS” – not a word.  
Try “NILPS” – not a word.  
Try “NILIS” – double I.  
Try “NILAS” – A is eliminated.  
Try “NILUS” – U is eliminated.  
No valid word.

Let’s try N in 1, I in 4, L in 2:  
Word: N _ L _ S  
Need a 3rd letter.  
Try “NULIS” – U is eliminated.  
Try “NCLIS” – not a word.  
Try “NDLIS” – not a word.  
Try “NPLIS” – not a word.  
No valid word.

Let’s try N in 3, I in 2, L in 1:

Try “LINCS” – valid word!  
Check constraints:
- L in 1 – allowed (cannot be 5).

- N in 3 – allowed (cannot be 2,4).  
- S in 5 – allowed (cannot be 1,3,4).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which aren't. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter early on, providing valuable information for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (not in position 4).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Good consonants to try next: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Let's pick a word that uses S in a different position and introduces new common letters. ""STINT"" uses S in position 1 and introduces T, I, N. This seems like a good next guess.

<|im_end|>

From the two previous guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – Eliminates A, R, O, E  
   – Confirms S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. stint → S(-) T(x) I(-) N(-) T(x)  
   – Eliminates T  
   – Confirms I is in the word but not in position 3  
   – Confirms N is in the word but not in position 4  
   – Confirms S is in the word but not in position 1  

So the secret word:
- Contains S, I, N (each in a different position than previously tried)  
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T  

Remaining common letters to try: U, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S, I, N exactly once each  
- Uses two other letters from the remaining pool  
- Places S not in position 1, I not in position 3, N not in position 4  

Let’s pick a word that re-uses S, I, N and introduces new common letters like U and L.  
A good candidate is “SUNIL”:
- S in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1 from the feedback) → reject  
Try “SULIN” – same issue with S in position 1.  

Next idea: place S in position 2 or 3 or 5.  
Try “INUS” – too short.  

Let’s try “SNIPS” – but we already know S is in the word, and we don’t know if P is allowed yet. Also double S might be risky.  

Better to keep S once and introduce new letters.  
Try “SULCI” – C is allowed, but U, L, C, S, I – but “SULCI” is obscure.  

Let’s try “SUNNY” – but N is already confirmed, and we don’t know if Y is allowed.  

Let’s try “SINGY” – G not yet tested, Y not yet tested.  

But we know N is not in position 4, so “SINGY” has N in position 3 – acceptable.  
Let’s check letters: S, I, N, G, Y.  
Eliminated letters so far: A, R, O, E, T.  
S, I, N are confirmed; G, Y are new.  

This seems valid.  

Another candidate: “SULCI” – but C is less common.  

“SINGY” seems the best choice.  

However, let me double-check:  
- S is in position 1 – but feedback says S is not in position 1 (from stint).  
Oops, reject.  

Next: move S to position 2.  
Try “USING” – U, S, I, N, G.  
- S in position 2 – allowed (not 1 or 4).  
- I in position 3 – but feedback says I is not in position 3 (from stint).  
Reject.  

Next: move S to position 3.  
Try “UNGIS” – obscure.  

Next: move S to position 5.  
Try “UNGIS” – again obscure.  

Let’s try “SULCI” – S in position 1 again – reject.  

Let’s try “SULCI” is invalid.  

Let’s try “SULCI” – no.  

Let’s try “SULCI” – no.  

Let me think differently: list positions and constraints.

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters known to be in word: S, I, N  
Letters known NOT in word: A, R, O, E, T  
Positions ruled out:  
- S ≠ 1, 4  
- I ≠ 3  
- N ≠ 4  

So S can be in 2, 3, or 5.  
I can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
N can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.  

Let’s pick S in position 2, I in position 1, N in position 3.  
Word: I S N _ _  
Need two more letters from remaining pool (U, L, C, D, M, P, etc.).  
Try “ISNUL” – not a word.  

Try “ISNIP” – P is new.  
Check letters: I, S, N, I, P – double I – invalid.  

Try “ISNED” – E is eliminated.  

Try “ISNUL” – invalid.  

Let’s try S in position 3, I in position 1, N in position 2.  
Word: I N S _ _  
Need two more letters.  
Try “INSUL” – valid word.  
Check letters: I, N, S, U, L.  
- S in position 3 – allowed (not 1 or 4).  
- I in position 1 – allowed.  
- N in position 2 – allowed.  
- U and L are new letters not yet tested.  

This seems valid.  

Let’s go with “INSUL”.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word: S, I, N, L  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, E, T, U  

Position constraints:
- S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4 (from guesses 1, 2, 3)  
  ⇒ S must be in position 2 or 5.
- I cannot be in positions 1, 3 (from guesses 2, 3)  
  ⇒ I must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- N cannot be in positions 2, 4 (from guesses 2, 3)  
  ⇒ N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- L cannot be in position 5 (from guess 3)  
  ⇒ L must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains exactly S, I, N, L once each, plus one more letter from the remaining unused pool (common unused letters: C, D, M, P, etc.).
- Respects all position constraints.

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: S in position 2  
Then word shape: _ S _ _ _  
Now place I, N, L in remaining positions (1,3,4,5) with constraints:
- I: 4,5 allowed (cannot be 1,3)  
- N: 1,3,5 allowed (cannot be 2,4)  
- L: 1,3,4 allowed (cannot be 5)  

Let’s try N in 1, I in 4, L in 3:  
Word: N S L I _  
Need a 5th letter. Remaining unused letters: C, D, M, P, etc.  
Try “NSLIC” – not a word.  
Try “NSLID” – not a word.  
Try “NSLIM” – not a word.  
Try “NSLIP” – not a word.  
Try “NSLIT” – T is eliminated.  
Try “NSLIX” – X not common.  
No obvious valid word.

Case 2: S in position 5  
Then word shape: _ _ _ _ S  
Place I, N, L in positions 1-4 with constraints:
- I: 1,2,4 allowed (cannot be 3)  
- N: 1,3 allowed (cannot be 2,4,5)  
- L: 1,2,3,4 allowed (cannot be 5)  

Let’s try N in 1, I in 2, L in 3:  
Word: N I L _ S  
Need a 4th letter.  
Try “NILCS” – not a word.  
Try “NILDS” – not a word.  
Try “NILMS” – not a word.  
Try “NILPS” – not a word.  
Try “NILIS” – double I.  
Try “NILAS” – A is eliminated.  
Try “NILUS” – U is eliminated.  
No valid word.

Let’s try N in 1, I in 4, L in 2:  
Word: N _ L _ S  
Need a 3rd letter.  
Try “NULIS” – U is eliminated.  
Try “NCLIS” – not a word.  
Try “NDLIS” – not a word.  
Try “NPLIS” – not a word.  
No valid word.

Let’s try N in 3, I in 2, L in 1:  
Word: L I N _ S  
Need a 4th letter.  
Try “LINCS” – valid word!  
Check constraints:
- L in 1 – allowed (cannot be 5).  
- I in 2 – allowed (cannot be 1,3).  
- N in 3 – allowed (cannot be 2,4).  
- S in 5 – allowed (cannot be 1,3,4).  
- C is a new letter not yet tested.  

This satisfies all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: stint -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(-) N(-) T(x)

From the latest feedback on “lincs”:

- L(✓) → L is in the word and in position 1.  
- I(✓) → I is in the word and in position 2.  
- N(✓) → N is in the word and in position 3.  
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.  
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in position 5.  

So the secret word has the fixed pattern:  
L I N _ S  

We only need to determine the 4th letter.  
Letters already confirmed: L, I, N, S  
Letters eliminated so far: A, R, O, E, T, U, C  

Remaining common letters for the blank: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  

Looking for real 5-letter words that fit L I N _ S:

- L I N K S  → “LINKS” (valid word)  
- L I N G S  → “ING” not a valid start.  
- L I N D S  → “INDS” not a word.  
- L I N G S  → “LINGS” (plural of ling, valid).  
- L I N G S  → “LINGS” is valid.  
- L I N K S  → “LINKS” is more common.  

Between “LINKS” and “LINGS”, “LINKS” is more frequent in word-guessing contexts.  
Let’s go with “LINKS”.
