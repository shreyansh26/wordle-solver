1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words in Wordle often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should ideally include several of these. 

""SLATE"" is a strong first choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us coverage of 5 very common letters, which should help narrow down the possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback.

Another candidate could be “TROOP”, but that repeats O and P might be less common. “ROUND” seems more balanced.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words in Wordle often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should ideally include several of these. 

""SLATE"" is a strong first choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us coverage of 5 very common letters, which should help narrow down the possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback.

- Uses R, O, U, N, D – all common letters not yet ruled out.
- Avoids S, L, A, E.

This seems like a good third guess to narrow down positions and test new letters.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (from all feedback):
S, L, A, E, U, N, D, C, F

Letters that ARE in the word (from all feedback):
- T (must appear somewhere, but not in position 4)
- R (must appear somewhere, but not in position 2)
- O (must be in the word and is in position 3)

So the word has the pattern:
_ _ O _ _

with letters T and R still to place, plus two more letters chosen only from the remaining alphabet (excluding the 9 letters already ruled out).

Remaining common letters (besides T, R, O) that have not been tried:
B, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We know:
- T cannot be in position 4 (from SLATE feedback)
- R cannot be in position 2 (from CROFT feedback)

Let’s list possible positions for T and R:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed:    _ _ O _ _

Possible placements:
- T can be in positions 1, 2, 5 (cannot be 3 or 4)
- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 2)

We need two more letters (from allowed set) to fill the remaining blanks.

Let’s try to pick a word that:
- Places T and R in new positions
- Introduces two fresh letters

A promising candidate is “PROXY”:
- P and Y are new letters
- R is in position 2 (allowed)
- O is in position 3 (correct)
- T is not in this word, so we need another word that contains T and R.

Let’s try “BROTH”:
- B and H are new letters
- R is in position 2 (allowed)
- O is in position 3 (correct)
- T is in position 5 (allowed)
- H is new

This satisfies all constraints.

So the next guess is BROTH.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words in Wordle often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should ideally include several of these. 

""SLATE"" is a strong first choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us coverage of 5 very common letters, which should help narrow down the possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
1. The word contains T, but T is not in the 4th position.
2. The word does NOT contain S, L, A, or E.

Next, we want a word that:
- Uses T (and places it in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Avoids S, L, A, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: R, O, I, N, C, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

A strong candidate is “ROUND”:
- Contains T (but we’re placing it in position 5, so T is in the word but not in position 4 – this satisfies the feedback).
- Uses R, O, U, N, D – all common letters not yet ruled out.
- Avoids S, L, A, E.

Another candidate could be “TROOP”, but that repeats O and P might be less common. “ROUND” seems more balanced.

So I’ll go with ROUND.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E
   - Letter in the word but NOT in position 4: T

2. ROUND → R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: U, N, D
   - Letters in the word but NOT in their current positions: R (not position 1), O (not position 2)

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: T, R, O
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, U, N, D
- T cannot be in position 4
- R cannot be in position 1
- O cannot be in position 2

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains T, R, O
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, E, U, N, D
- Places T, R, O in allowed positions

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): I, C, G, H, M, P, Y, B, F, K, V, W, etc.

Let's try to build a word:
- We have three required letters: T, R, O
- We need two more letters from the allowed set

Possible structure:
- T can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5
- R can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5
- O can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5

Let's try ""CROFT"":
- Letters: C, R, O, F, T
- Contains all required letters (T, R, O)
- Uses C and F which are allowed
- Positions:
  - T is in position 5 (allowed)
  - R is in position 2 (allowed)
  - O is in position 3 (allowed)
  - C and F are new letters we haven't tested yet

This seems like a good third guess to narrow down positions and test new letters.

Letters NOT in the word (from all feedback):

Letters that ARE in the word:
- T (must appear, but not in positions 4 or 5)
- R (must appear, but not in positions 2 or 3)
- O (must be in position 3)

Current pattern: _ _ O _ _

Allowed positions for the remaining letters:
- T can only be in position 1 or 2 (cannot be 4 or 5)
- R can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3)

We need two more distinct letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the 10 ruled-out letters). Remaining common letters: G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

From Guess 4 we also learned:
- H is in the word but not in position 5.

So the word contains T, R, O, H and one more new letter.

Possible placements:
- O is fixed at position 3
- T must be at 1 or 2
- R must be at 1, 4, or 5
- H must be at 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 5 from feedback), so 1, 2, or 4

Let’s try to build valid combinations.

Option 1: T at 1
Pattern: T _ O _ _
Then R and H must go in positions 2, 4, 5 (but R cannot be 2, H cannot be 5)
Possible:
- T H O _ _ → R must be 4 or 5, but we need one more letter
- T R O _ _ → H must be 4 or 5, but R is 2 which is invalid (R cannot be 2)
- T _ O R H → valid: T _ O R H, but we need a letter in position 2

Option 2: T at 2
Pattern: _ T O _ _
Then R must be 1, 4, or 5
H must be 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2)
Possible:
- R T O _ _ → H must be 4 or 5
- _ T O R H → first letter must be new letter (from allowed set)

Let’s try _ T O R H:
- First letter must be a new allowed letter (G, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y)
- Common choice: G → G T O R H → GTORH (invalid, not a word)
- Try M → M T O R H → MTORH (invalid)
- Try P → P T O R H → PTORH (invalid)
- Try V → V T O R H → VTORH (invalid)
- Try W → W T O R H → WTORH (invalid)
- Try Y → Y T O R H → YT ORH (invalid)

None of these are valid English words. Let’s try R at 1 and T at 2:
R T O _ _
H must be 4 or 5
- R T O _ H → need a letter at 4
- R T O H _ → need a letter at 5

Try R T O M H → RTOMH (invalid)
Try R T O G H → RTOGH (invalid)
Try R T O P H → RTPH (invalid)

Next option: T at 1, H at 2
T H O _ _
R must be 4 or 5
Need one more letter at 5 (or 4)
- T H O _ R → need a letter at 4
- T H O R _ → need a letter at 5

Try T H O G R → THOGR (invalid)
Try T H O M R → THOMR (invalid)
Try T H O P R → THOPR (invalid)

Try T at 1, R at 4, H at 2
T H O R _
Need a letter at 5
- T H O R G → THORG (invalid)
- T H O R M → THORM (invalid)
- T H O R P → THORP (valid word)

THORP is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s check constraints:
- T at 1: allowed
- H at 2: allowed
- O at 3: correct
- R at 4: allowed
- P at 5: new letter, allowed

This satisfies all feedback so far.

<guess>THORP</guess>",THORP,"Let’s update our knowledge after the fourth guess.

Letters NOT in the word (from all feedback):
S, L, A, E, U, N, D, C, F, B

Letters that ARE in the word:
- T (must appear, but not in positions 4 or 5)
- R (must appear, but not in positions 2 or 3)
- O (must be in position 3)

Current pattern: _ _ O _ _

Allowed positions for the remaining letters:
- T can only be in position 1 or 2 (cannot be 4 or 5)
- R can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3)

We need two more distinct letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the 10 ruled-out letters). Remaining common letters: G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

From Guess 4 we also learned:
- H is in the word but not in position 5.

So the word contains T, R, O, H and one more new letter.

Possible placements:
- O is fixed at position 3
- T must be at 1 or 2
- R must be at 1, 4, or 5
- H must be at 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 5 from feedback), so 1, 2, or 4

Let’s try to build valid combinations.

Option 1: T at 1
Pattern: T _ O _ _
Then R and H must go in positions 2, 4, 5 (but R cannot be 2, H cannot be 5)
Possible:

- T R O _ _ → H must be 4 or 5, but R is 2 which is invalid (R cannot be 2)
- T _ O R H → valid: T _ O R H, but we need a letter in position 2

Option 2: T at 2
Pattern: _ T O _ _
Then R must be 1, 4, or 5
H must be 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2)
Possible:
- R T O _ _ → H must be 4 or 5
- _ T O R H → first letter must be new letter (from allowed set)

Let’s try _ T O R H:
- First letter must be a new allowed letter (G, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y)
- Common choice: G → G T O R H → GTORH (invalid, not a word)

- Try V → V T O R H → VTORH (invalid)
- Try W → W T O R H → WTORH (invalid)

- R T O _ H → need a letter at 4
- R T O H _ → need a letter at 5

Try R T O M H → RTOMH (invalid)
Try R T O G H → RTOGH (invalid)
Try R T O P H → RTPH (invalid)

Next option: T at 1, H at 2
T H O _ _
R must be 4 or 5

THORP is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s check constraints:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words in Wordle often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should ideally include several of these. 

""SLATE"" is a strong first choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us coverage of 5 very common letters, which should help narrow down the possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
1. The word contains T, but T is not in the 4th position.
2. The word does NOT contain S, L, A, or E.

Next, we want a word that:
- Uses T (and places it in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Avoids S, L, A, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: R, O, I, N, C, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

A strong candidate is “ROUND”:
- Contains T (but we’re placing it in position 5, so T is in the word but not in position 4 – this satisfies the feedback).
- Uses R, O, U, N, D – all common letters not yet ruled out.
- Avoids S, L, A, E.

Another candidate could be “TROOP”, but that repeats O and P might be less common. “ROUND” seems more balanced.

So I’ll go with ROUND.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E
   - Letter in the word but NOT in position 4: T

2. ROUND → R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: U, N, D
   - Letters in the word but NOT in their current positions: R (not position 1), O (not position 2)

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: T, R, O
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, U, N, D
- T cannot be in position 4
- R cannot be in position 1
- O cannot be in position 2

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains T, R, O
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, E, U, N, D
- Places T, R, O in allowed positions

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): I, C, G, H, M, P, Y, B, F, K, V, W, etc.

Let's try to build a word:
- We have three required letters: T, R, O
- We need two more letters from the allowed set

Possible structure:
- T can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5
- R can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5
- O can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5

Let's try ""CROFT"":
- Letters: C, R, O, F, T
- Contains all required letters (T, R, O)
- Uses C and F which are allowed
- Positions:
  - T is in position 5 (allowed)
  - R is in position 2 (allowed)
  - O is in position 3 (allowed)
  - C and F are new letters we haven't tested yet

This seems like a good third guess to narrow down positions and test new letters.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (from all feedback):
S, L, A, E, U, N, D, C, F

Letters that ARE in the word (from all feedback):
- T (must appear somewhere, but not in position 4)
- R (must appear somewhere, but not in position 2)
- O (must be in the word and is in position 3)

So the word has the pattern:
_ _ O _ _

with letters T and R still to place, plus two more letters chosen only from the remaining alphabet (excluding the 9 letters already ruled out).

Remaining common letters (besides T, R, O) that have not been tried:
B, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We know:
- T cannot be in position 4 (from SLATE feedback)
- R cannot be in position 2 (from CROFT feedback)

Let’s list possible positions for T and R:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed:    _ _ O _ _

Possible placements:
- T can be in positions 1, 2, 5 (cannot be 3 or 4)
- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (cannot be 2)

We need two more letters (from allowed set) to fill the remaining blanks.

Let’s try to pick a word that:
- Places T and R in new positions
- Introduces two fresh letters

A promising candidate is “PROXY”:
- P and Y are new letters
- R is in position 2 (allowed)
- O is in position 3 (correct)
- T is not in this word, so we need another word that contains T and R.

Let’s try “BROTH”:
- B and H are new letters
- R is in position 2 (allowed)
- O is in position 3 (correct)
- T is in position 5 (allowed)
- H is new

This satisfies all constraints.

So the next guess is BROTH.

Let’s update our knowledge after the fourth guess.

Letters NOT in the word (from all feedback):
S, L, A, E, U, N, D, C, F, B

Letters that ARE in the word:
- T (must appear, but not in positions 4 or 5)
- R (must appear, but not in positions 2 or 3)
- O (must be in position 3)

Current pattern: _ _ O _ _

Allowed positions for the remaining letters:
- T can only be in position 1 or 2 (cannot be 4 or 5)
- R can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3)

We need two more distinct letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the 10 ruled-out letters). Remaining common letters: G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

From Guess 4 we also learned:
- H is in the word but not in position 5.

So the word contains T, R, O, H and one more new letter.

Possible placements:
- O is fixed at position 3
- T must be at 1 or 2
- R must be at 1, 4, or 5
- H must be at 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 5 from feedback), so 1, 2, or 4

Let’s try to build valid combinations.

Option 1: T at 1
Pattern: T _ O _ _
Then R and H must go in positions 2, 4, 5 (but R cannot be 2, H cannot be 5)
Possible:
- T H O _ _ → R must be 4 or 5, but we need one more letter
- T R O _ _ → H must be 4 or 5, but R is 2 which is invalid (R cannot be 2)
- T _ O R H → valid: T _ O R H, but we need a letter in position 2

Option 2: T at 2
Pattern: _ T O _ _
Then R must be 1, 4, or 5
H must be 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2)
Possible:
- R T O _ _ → H must be 4 or 5
- _ T O R H → first letter must be new letter (from allowed set)

Let’s try _ T O R H:
- First letter must be a new allowed letter (G, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y)
- Common choice: G → G T O R H → GTORH (invalid, not a word)
- Try M → M T O R H → MTORH (invalid)
- Try P → P T O R H → PTORH (invalid)
- Try V → V T O R H → VTORH (invalid)
- Try W → W T O R H → WTORH (invalid)
- Try Y → Y T O R H → YT ORH (invalid)

None of these are valid English words. Let’s try R at 1 and T at 2:
R T O _ _
H must be 4 or 5
- R T O _ H → need a letter at 4
- R T O H _ → need a letter at 5

Try R T O M H → RTOMH (invalid)
Try R T O G H → RTOGH (invalid)
Try R T O P H → RTPH (invalid)

Next option: T at 1, H at 2
T H O _ _
R must be 4 or 5
Need one more letter at 5 (or 4)
- T H O _ R → need a letter at 4
- T H O R _ → need a letter at 5

Try T H O G R → THOGR (invalid)
Try T H O M R → THOMR (invalid)
Try T H O P R → THOPR (invalid)

Try T at 1, R at 4, H at 2
T H O R _
Need a letter at 5
- T H O R G → THORG (invalid)
- T H O R M → THORM (invalid)
- T H O R P → THORP (valid word)

THORP is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s check constraints:
- T at 1: allowed
- H at 2: allowed
- O at 3: correct
- R at 4: allowed
- P at 5: new letter, allowed

This satisfies all feedback so far.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with THOR and ends with one of these letters.  
Valid English words:
- THORE – but E was ruled out in Guess 1
- THORK – valid
- THORM – not common
- THORV – not a word
- THORW – not a word
- THORY – not a word

The only common valid word left is THORK.

Check constraints:
- T, H, O, R already confirmed in correct positions
- K hasn’t been used or ruled out

Therefore, the secret word must be THORK.
