### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify many letters early on.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify many letters early on.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or S
- Contains both O and E, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O somewhere other than position 3
2. Has E somewhere other than position 5
3. Does not contain A, R, or S
4. Is a valid English word

Possible consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.
Possible vowels left: I, U (since A is out and O and E are confirmed)

Let's try a word that uses O and E in different positions and introduces new common consonants. ""DOING"" comes to mind:
- D: new consonant
- O: position 2 (not 3)
- I: new vowel
- N: new consonant
- G: new consonant

Also, E is not in position 5 here, so it satisfies the constraints.

Guess 2: DOING -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) G(x)
<|im_end|>

Current constraints:
- Letters not in the word: A, R, S, D, I, G
- Letters confirmed in the word:
  – O is in position 2 (O✓)
  – E is somewhere, but not in position 5 (E- from AROSE, N- from DOING means E isn’t in 4 either)
  – N is in the word but not in position 4
- Pattern so far: _ O _ _ _

We still need to place E and N somewhere, and fill the remaining slots with letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions left for E: 1, 2, 3 (but 2 is O), so 1 or 3
Possible positions left for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is O), so 1, 3, 5

Let’s try to place E in position 1 and N in position 3:
Word shape: E O N _ _

We need two more consonants. Common unused consonants: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y.

Let’s pick two common ones: L and T.
Check if EONLT is a valid word – no. Let’s rearrange to form a valid word.

A valid word that fits: E O N _ _ is “EONIC” (but I is ruled out), “EONED” (D ruled out), “EONIC” invalid. 

Try E in position 3 and N in position 5:
Word shape: _ O E _ N

Fill the blanks with unused consonants. Let’s try “COVEN”:
- C: new
- O: position 2 ✓
- V: new
- E: position 3 (allowed)
- N: position 5 (allowed)

Check letters: C, O, V, E, N – none are in the banned list (A, R, S, D, I, G). It’s a valid English word.

So COVEN satisfies all constraints.

Let's update our knowledge after the fourth guess.

1. Pattern so far: _ O _ _ _  (O is fixed in position 2)
2. Letters known to be in the word:
   - E (from COVEN and NOBLE) – but its correct position is still unknown (it was “-” in both COVEN and NOBLE, meaning it is in the word but not in position 4 or 5)
   - N (from DOING and NOBLE) – it is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from DOING it was not in 4, from NOBLE it was not in 1). Therefore N must be in position 3.
3. Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, S, D, I, G, C, V, B, L
4. So the word must be: _ O N _ _
5. E is somewhere in the word but not in positions 4 or 5, and position 2 is O, position 3 is N, so E must be in position 1.
6. Therefore the pattern is: E O N _ _
7. We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with EON and has a valid fifth letter, using only letters not yet excluded.

Possible fifth letters (not excluded): F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common words:
- EONIC – I is excluded
- EONED – D is excluded
- EONEY – Y is allowed, but is EONEY a word? No
- EONUM – not a word
- EONUT – not a word
- EONIC – already excluded
- EONUM – not a word
- EONIC – excluded
- EONIC – excluded
- EONIC – excluded
- EONIC – excluded

Wait, let me think differently. The pattern is E O N _ _. The only common English word that fits is EONIC, but I is excluded. Is there another?

Actually, EONIC is the only common word that fits, but I is excluded. Let me check if I missed any.

Another approach: maybe E is not in position 1. But according to the constraints:
- E must be in the word (from COVEN and NOBLE feedback)
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5
- Positions 2 and 3 are O and N respectively
- Therefore E must be in position 1

So the word must be E O N _ _

Looking at the remaining letters, the only valid word seems to be EONIC, but I is excluded. Is there any other?

Wait, let me check EONIC again. I is excluded, so EONIC is invalid.

Hmm, maybe I missed a word. Let me think of other possibilities.

Another possibility: E O N _ _ with letters not excluded.

Possible letters for position 5: F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y

- EONF? – not a word
- EONH? – not a word
- EONK? – not a word
- EONM? – not a word
- EONP? – not a word
- EONT? – not a word
- EONU? – not a word
- EONW? – not a word
- EONY? – not a word

This is concerning. It seems like there might be an error in my reasoning.

Let me re-examine the constraints:

From COVEN: E is in the word but not in position 4
From NOBLE: E is in the word but not in position 5
Therefore E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3
But position 2 is O, position 3 is N (from N must be in position 3), so E must be in position 1

Thus the word must be E O N _ _

But there seems to be no valid 5-letter English word that starts with EON and has a valid fifth letter from the remaining allowed letters.

This suggests I may have made an error in deducing N must be in position 3.

Let me re-examine N's placement:

From DOING: N is in the word but not in position 4
From NOBLE: N is in the word but not in position 1
Thus N can be in positions 2, 3, or 5
But position 2 is O, so N can be in positions 3 or 5

Previously I thought N must be in position 3 because it couldn't be in 5, but actually:
- From DOING: N not in 4
- From NOBLE: N not in 1
So N could be in 3 or 5

This changes things. Let me re-examine.

Current constraints:
1. Pattern: _ O _ _ _  (O in position 2)
2. Letters known:
   - E must be in word, not in 4 or 5 → E must be in 1 or 3
   - N must be in word, not in 1 or 4 → N must be in 3 or 5
3. Letters excluded: A, R, S, D, I, G, C, V, B, L

Case 1: N in position 3
   Then pattern: _ O N _ _
   E must be in position 1 (since 3 is taken by N and 4,5 are excluded for E)
   So word: E O N _ _
   Need a valid 5-letter word starting with EON and ending with any allowed letter.

Possible letters for position 5: F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y
Looking for common words:
- EONIC – I is excluded
- EONED – D is excluded
- EONEY – Y is allowed, but EONEY is not a valid word
- EONUM – not a word
- EONUT – not a word
- EONIC – excluded
- EONIC – excluded

This seems problematic. Maybe E is in position 3 and N in position 5?

Case 2: N in position 5
   Then pattern: _ O _ _ N
   E must be in position 1 or 3
   If E is in position 1: E O _ _ N
   Need a valid word E O _ _ N with allowed letters.

Possible letters for positions 3,4: from remaining allowed letters F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y

Looking for common words:
- EOTWN – not a word
- EOPHN – not a word
- EOTFN – not a word
- EOTKN – not a word
- EOTMN – not a word
- EOTPN – not a word
- EOTUN – not a word
- EOTWN – not a word
- EOTYN – not a word

This also seems problematic.

Wait, let me check if I missed any letters. The excluded letters are: A, R, S, D, I, G, C, V, B, L

Remaining consonants: F, H, K, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U

Looking back at Case 1: E O N _ _
The only possible word seems to be EONIC, but I is excluded. Is there any other word?

Actually, ""EONIC"" is the only common word starting with EON, but I is excluded. This suggests there might be no valid word under these constraints, which can't be right.

Let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

From COVEN: V(x) – V is excluded
From NOBLE: B(x), L(x) – B and L are excluded
From DOING: I(x) – I is excluded
From AROSE: A(x), R(x), S(x) – A, R, S are excluded
From Guess 1: A(x), R(x), S(x) – same
From Guess 2: D(x), I(x), G(x) – same
From Guess 3: C(x), V(x) – same

So excluded letters: A, R, S, D, I, G, C, V, B, L

Remaining letters: E, N, O, plus F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y

Pattern: _ O _ _ _ with E and N somewhere, and no excluded letters.

Let me try to list possible words:

E O N _ _ : EONIC (invalid), EONUM (invalid), etc. – none seem valid.

_ O _ _ _ with E and N:

Possible positions:
- E in 1, N in 3: E O N _ _
- E in 1, N in 5: E O _ _ N
- E in 3, N in 5: _ O E _ N

Let's check each:

1. E O N _ _ : no valid words
2. E O _ _ N : need letters for 3,4 from F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y
   Possible: E O F T N – not a word
   E O M P N – not a word
   E O T H N – not a word
   E O P H N – not a word
   E O U N – too short
3. _ O E _ N : need first and fourth letters from remaining
   Possible: M O E N – too short
   F O E N – not a word
   H O E N – not a word
   K O E N – not a word
   P O E N – not a word
   T O E N – not a word
   W O E N – not a word
   Y O E N – not a word

This is very concerning. It appears there might be an error in my deduction.

Wait, let me check if ""EONIC"" is actually a valid word. Yes, ""eonic"" is an adjective meaning relating to the eon, but it's quite rare. However, ""EONIC"" might not be in standard word lists.

Another possibility: ""EONIC"" might not be valid, so let me think of other words.

Actually, ""EONIC"" is the only common word starting with EON, but since I is excluded, this is invalid.

This suggests I need to re-examine if N must be in position 3.

Let me try N in position 5 and E in position 3:

Pattern: _ O E _ N
Need first and fourth letters from remaining: F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y

Possible words:
- FOGEN – not a word
- HOKEN – not a word
- MOKEN – not a word
- POKEN – not a word
- TOKEN – valid word! (a coin or token)
- FOKEN – not a word
- HOKEN – not a word
- WOKEN – valid word (past participle of wake)
- YOKEN – not a word

Between TOKEN and WOKEN, both fit the pattern _ O E _ N and use allowed letters.

Let me check:
- TOKEN: T, O, K, E, N – all allowed letters
- WOKEN: W, O, K, E, N – all allowed letters

Both are valid. I'll choose TOKEN.

But let me verify:
- O is in position 2 ✓
- E is in position 4 – but from COVEN and NOBLE, E must be in the word but not in positions 4 or 5. This would place E in position 4, which is invalid.

Ah, here's the mistake! From COVEN: E is in the word but not in position 4
From NOBLE: E is in the word but not in position 5
Therefore E can only be in positions 1 or 3

In the pattern _ O E _ N, E is in position 3 – this is allowed.

So the word would be _ O E _ N with first and fourth letters from remaining.

Possible words:
- FOGEN – not a word
- HOKEN – not a word
- MOKEN – not a word
- POKEN – not a word
- TOKEN – valid
- WOKEN – valid
- YOKEN – not a word

Between TOKEN and WOKEN, both fit:
- TOKEN: T, O, K, E, N – all allowed
- WOKEN: W, O, K, E, N – all allowed

I'll choose TOKEN.

But let me check if there's any other possibility.

Another possibility: N in position 3 and E in position 1: E O N _ _
Need a valid word E O N _ _ with allowed letters.

Possible letters for position 5: F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y

- EONIC – I excluded
- EONUM – not a word
- EONUT – not a word
- EONKF – not a word
- EONHF – not a word
- EONMF – not a word
- EONPF – not a word
- EONTF – not a word
- EONUF – not a word
- EONWF – not a word
- EONYF – not a word

This seems impossible. Therefore, the only valid word appears to be TOKEN or WOKEN.

Between the two, ""TOKEN"" is more common.

Thus, the next guess is TOKEN.
</think>

<guess>TOKEN</guess>",TOKEN,"Let's update our knowledge after the fourth guess.

1. Pattern so far: _ O _ _ _  (O is fixed in position 2)
2. Letters known to be in the word:
   - E (from COVEN and NOBLE) – but its correct position is still unknown (it was “-” in both COVEN and NOBLE, meaning it is in the word but not in position 4 or 5)
   - N (from DOING and NOBLE) – it is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from DOING it was not in 4, from NOBLE it was not in 1). Therefore N must be in position 3.
3. Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, S, D, I, G, C, V, B, L
4. So the word must be: _ O N _ _
5. E is somewhere in the word but not in positions 4 or 5, and position 2 is O, position 3 is N, so E must be in position 1.
6. Therefore the pattern is: E O N _ _
7. We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with EON and has a valid fifth letter, using only letters not yet excluded.

Possible fifth letters (not excluded): F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common words:
- EONIC – I is excluded
- EONED – D is excluded
- EONEY – Y is allowed, but is EONEY a word? No
- EONUM – not a word
- EONUT – not a word
- EONIC – already excluded
- EONUM – not a word
- EONIC – excluded
- EONIC – excluded
- EONIC – excluded
- EONIC – excluded

Wait, let me think differently. The pattern is E O N _ _. The only common English word that fits is EONIC, but I is excluded. Is there another?

Actually, EONIC is the only common word that fits, but I is excluded. Let me check if I missed any.

Another approach: maybe E is not in position 1. But according to the constraints:
- E must be in the word (from COVEN and NOBLE feedback)
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5
- Positions 2 and 3 are O and N respectively
- Therefore E must be in position 1

So the word must be E O N _ _

Looking at the remaining letters, the only valid word seems to be EONIC, but I is excluded. Is there any other?

Wait, let me check EONIC again. I is excluded, so EONIC is invalid.

Hmm, maybe I missed a word. Let me think of other possibilities.

Another possibility: E O N _ _ with letters not excluded.

Possible letters for position 5: F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y

- EONF? – not a word
- EONH? – not a word
- EONK? – not a word
- EONM? – not a word
- EONP? – not a word
- EONT? – not a word
- EONU? – not a word
- EONW? – not a word
- EONY? – not a word

This is concerning. It seems like there might be an error in my reasoning.

Let me re-examine the constraints:

From COVEN: E is in the word but not in position 4
From NOBLE: E is in the word but not in position 5
Therefore E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3
But position 2 is O, position 3 is N (from N must be in position 3), so E must be in position 1

Thus the word must be E O N _ _

But there seems to be no valid 5-letter English word that starts with EON and has a valid fifth letter from the remaining allowed letters.

This suggests I may have made an error in deducing N must be in position 3.

Let me re-examine N's placement:

From DOING: N is in the word but not in position 4
From NOBLE: N is in the word but not in position 1
Thus N can be in positions 2, 3, or 5
But position 2 is O, so N can be in positions 3 or 5

Previously I thought N must be in position 3 because it couldn't be in 5, but actually:
- From DOING: N not in 4
- From NOBLE: N not in 1
So N could be in 3 or 5

This changes things. Let me re-examine.

Current constraints:
1. Pattern: _ O _ _ _  (O in position 2)
2. Letters known:
   - E must be in word, not in 4 or 5 → E must be in 1 or 3
   - N must be in word, not in 1 or 4 → N must be in 3 or 5
3. Letters excluded: A, R, S, D, I, G, C, V, B, L

Case 1: N in position 3
   Then pattern: _ O N _ _
   E must be in position 1 (since 3 is taken by N and 4,5 are excluded for E)
   So word: E O N _ _
   Need a valid 5-letter word starting with EON and ending with any allowed letter.

Possible letters for position 5: F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y
Looking for common words:
- EONIC – I is excluded
- EONED – D is excluded
- EONEY – Y is allowed, but EONEY is not a valid word
- EONUM – not a word
- EONUT – not a word
- EONIC – excluded
- EONIC – excluded

This seems problematic. Maybe E is in position 3 and N in position 5?

Case 2: N in position 5
   Then pattern: _ O _ _ N
   E must be in position 1 or 3
   If E is in position 1: E O _ _ N
   Need a valid word E O _ _ N with allowed letters.

Possible letters for positions 3,4: from remaining allowed letters F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y

Looking for common words:
- EOTWN – not a word
- EOPHN – not a word
- EOTFN – not a word
- EOTKN – not a word
- EOTMN – not a word
- EOTPN – not a word
- EOTUN – not a word
- EOTWN – not a word
- EOTYN – not a word

This also seems problematic.

Wait, let me check if I missed any letters. The excluded letters are: A, R, S, D, I, G, C, V, B, L

Remaining consonants: F, H, K, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U

Looking back at Case 1: E O N _ _
The only possible word seems to be EONIC, but I is excluded. Is there any other word?

Actually, ""EONIC"" is the only common word starting with EON, but I is excluded. This suggests there might be no valid word under these constraints, which can't be right.

Let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

From COVEN: V(x) – V is excluded
From NOBLE: B(x), L(x) – B and L are excluded
From DOING: I(x) – I is excluded
From AROSE: A(x), R(x), S(x) – A, R, S are excluded
From Guess 1: A(x), R(x), S(x) – same
From Guess 2: D(x), I(x), G(x) – same
From Guess 3: C(x), V(x) – same

So excluded letters: A, R, S, D, I, G, C, V, B, L

Remaining letters: E, N, O, plus F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y

Pattern: _ O _ _ _ with E and N somewhere, and no excluded letters.

Let me try to list possible words:

E O N _ _ : EONIC (invalid), EONUM (invalid), etc. – none seem valid.

_ O _ _ _ with E and N:

Possible positions:
- E in 1, N in 3: E O N _ _
- E in 1, N in 5: E O _ _ N
- E in 3, N in 5: _ O E _ N

Let's check each:

1. E O N _ _ : no valid words
2. E O _ _ N : need letters for 3,4 from F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y
   Possible: E O F T N – not a word
   E O M P N – not a word
   E O T H N – not a word
   E O P H N – not a word
   E O U N – too short
3. _ O E _ N : need first and fourth letters from remaining
   Possible: M O E N – too short
   F O E N – not a word
   H O E N – not a word
   K O E N – not a word
   P O E N – not a word
   T O E N – not a word
   W O E N – not a word
   Y O E N – not a word

This is very concerning. It appears there might be an error in my deduction.

Wait, let me check if ""EONIC"" is actually a valid word. Yes, ""eonic"" is an adjective meaning relating to the eon, but it's quite rare. However, ""EONIC"" might not be in standard word lists.

Another possibility: ""EONIC"" might not be valid, so let me think of other words.

Actually, ""EONIC"" is the only common word starting with EON, but since I is excluded, this is invalid.

This suggests I need to re-examine if N must be in position 3.

Let me try N in position 5 and E in position 3:

Pattern: _ O E _ N
Need first and fourth letters from remaining: F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y

Possible words:
- FOGEN – not a word
- HOKEN – not a word
- MOKEN – not a word
- POKEN – not a word
- TOKEN – valid word! (a coin or token)
- FOKEN – not a word
- HOKEN – not a word
- WOKEN – valid word (past participle of wake)
- YOKEN – not a word

Between TOKEN and WOKEN, both fit the pattern _ O E _ N and use allowed letters.

Let me check:
- TOKEN: T, O, K, E, N – all allowed letters
- WOKEN: W, O, K, E, N – all allowed letters

Both are valid. I'll choose TOKEN.

But let me verify:
- O is in position 2 ✓
- E is in position 4 – but from COVEN and NOBLE, E must be in the word but not in positions 4 or 5. This would place E in position 4, which is invalid.

Ah, here's the mistake! From COVEN: E is in the word but not in position 4
From NOBLE: E is in the word but not in position 5
Therefore E can only be in positions 1 or 3

In the pattern _ O E _ N, E is in position 3 – this is allowed.

So the word would be _ O E _ N with first and fourth letters from remaining.

Possible words:
- FOGEN – not a word
- HOKEN – not a word
- MOKEN – not a word
- POKEN – not a word
- TOKEN – valid
- WOKEN – valid
- YOKEN – not a word

Between TOKEN and WOKEN, both fit:
- TOKEN: T, O, K, E, N – all allowed
- WOKEN: W, O, K, E, N – all allowed

I'll choose TOKEN.

But let me check if there's any other possibility.

Another possibility: N in position 3 and E in position 1: E O N _ _
Need a valid word E O N _ _ with allowed letters.

Possible letters for position 5: F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y

- EONIC – I excluded
- EONUM – not a word
- EONUT – not a word
- EONKF – not a word
- EONHF – not a word
- EONMF – not a word
- EONPF – not a word
- EONTF – not a word
- EONUF – not a word
- EONWF – not a word
- EONYF – not a word

This seems impossible. Therefore, the only valid word appears to be TOKEN or WOKEN.

Between the two, ""TOKEN"" is more common.

Thus, the next guess is TOKEN.",Guess 5: TOKEN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓) N(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify many letters early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or S
- Contains both O and E, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O somewhere other than position 3
2. Has E somewhere other than position 5
3. Does not contain A, R, or S
4. Is a valid English word

Possible consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.
Possible vowels left: I, U (since A is out and O and E are confirmed)

Let's try a word that uses O and E in different positions and introduces new common consonants. ""DOING"" comes to mind:
- D: new consonant
- O: position 2 (not 3)
- I: new vowel
- N: new consonant
- G: new consonant

Also, E is not in position 5 here, so it satisfies the constraints.

Guess 2: DOING -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) G(x)
<|im_end|>

Current constraints:
- Letters not in the word: A, R, S, D, I, G
- Letters confirmed in the word:
  – O is in position 2 (O✓)
  – E is somewhere, but not in position 5 (E- from AROSE, N- from DOING means E isn’t in 4 either)
  – N is in the word but not in position 4
- Pattern so far: _ O _ _ _

We still need to place E and N somewhere, and fill the remaining slots with letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions left for E: 1, 2, 3 (but 2 is O), so 1 or 3
Possible positions left for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is O), so 1, 3, 5

Let’s try to place E in position 1 and N in position 3:
Word shape: E O N _ _

We need two more consonants. Common unused consonants: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y.

Let’s pick two common ones: L and T.
Check if EONLT is a valid word – no. Let’s rearrange to form a valid word.

A valid word that fits: E O N _ _ is “EONIC” (but I is ruled out), “EONED” (D ruled out), “EONIC” invalid. 

Try E in position 3 and N in position 5:
Word shape: _ O E _ N

Fill the blanks with unused consonants. Let’s try “COVEN”:
- C: new
- O: position 2 ✓
- V: new
- E: position 3 (allowed)
- N: position 5 (allowed)

Check letters: C, O, V, E, N – none are in the banned list (A, R, S, D, I, G). It’s a valid English word.

So COVEN satisfies all constraints.

Current known facts:
1. Word pattern: _ O _ E _  (O in position 2, E in position 4)
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, S, D, I, G, C, V
3. Letter N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from COVEN feedback)
4. Therefore N must be in position 1 or 3
5. Remaining unused consonants: B, F, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.
6. Remaining unused vowels: U (only one left)

Let's consider both possible positions for N:

Case 1: N in position 1 → N O _ E _
   Need a valid 5-letter word starting with NO and having E in position 4.
   Possible: NOBLE, NOOSE, NOVEL, NOBLE, NOVEL, NOSEY, etc.
   Check against banned letters:
   - NOBLE: B is allowed, L is allowed → valid
   - NOOSE: S is banned → invalid
   - NOVEL: L is allowed → valid
   - NOBLE and NOVEL are both valid options. Let's pick NOBLE.

Case 2: N in position 3 → _ O N E _
   Need a valid 5-letter word with N in position 3 and E in position 4.
   Possible: BONNE (invalid, double N), CONNE (invalid), FONNE (invalid), etc. 
   Actually, common words with O N E pattern are rare. Let's see:
   - BONNE: not common, and B is allowed but double N may not help
   - CONNE: C is banned
   - FONNE: not a word
   - HONNE: not a word
   - LONER: has E in position 4 and N in position 3 → L O N E R
     Check letters: L, O, N, E, R → R is banned → invalid
   - MONEL: M, O, N, E, L → M and L are allowed → MONEL is a valid word (a type of alloy)

Between NOBLE and MONEL, both fit constraints. Let's choose NOBLE first.

However, let me double-check:
NOBLE: N(1), O(2), B(3), L(4), E(5)
- O in position 2 ✓
- E in position 4 ✓
- N in position 1 (allowed, since N is only banned from position 5)
- Letters: N, O, B, L, E → none are banned (A,R,S,D,I,G,C,V excluded)
- Valid English word → correct

So the next guess is NOBLE.

Let's update our knowledge after the fourth guess.

1. Pattern so far: _ O _ _ _  (O is fixed in position 2)
2. Letters known to be in the word:
   - E (from COVEN and NOBLE) – but its correct position is still unknown (it was “-” in both COVEN and NOBLE, meaning it is in the word but not in position 4 or 5)
   - N (from DOING and NOBLE) – it is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from DOING it was not in 4, from NOBLE it was not in 1). Therefore N must be in position 3.
3. Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, S, D, I, G, C, V, B, L
4. So the word must be: _ O N _ _
5. E is somewhere in the word but not in positions 4 or 5, and position 2 is O, position 3 is N, so E must be in position 1.
6. Therefore the pattern is: E O N _ _
7. We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with EON and has a valid fifth letter, using only letters not yet excluded.

Possible fifth letters (not excluded): F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common words:
- EONIC – I is excluded
- EONED – D is excluded
- EONEY – Y is allowed, but is EONEY a word? No
- EONUM – not a word
- EONUT – not a word
- EONIC – already excluded
- EONUM – not a word
- EONIC – excluded
- EONIC – excluded
- EONIC – excluded
- EONIC – excluded

Wait, let me think differently. The pattern is E O N _ _. The only common English word that fits is EONIC, but I is excluded. Is there another?

Actually, EONIC is the only common word that fits, but I is excluded. Let me check if I missed any.

Another approach: maybe E is not in position 1. But according to the constraints:
- E must be in the word (from COVEN and NOBLE feedback)
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5
- Positions 2 and 3 are O and N respectively
- Therefore E must be in position 1

So the word must be E O N _ _

Looking at the remaining letters, the only valid word seems to be EONIC, but I is excluded. Is there any other?

Wait, let me check EONIC again. I is excluded, so EONIC is invalid.

Hmm, maybe I missed a word. Let me think of other possibilities.

Another possibility: E O N _ _ with letters not excluded.

Possible letters for position 5: F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y

- EONF? – not a word
- EONH? – not a word
- EONK? – not a word
- EONM? – not a word
- EONP? – not a word
- EONT? – not a word
- EONU? – not a word
- EONW? – not a word
- EONY? – not a word

This is concerning. It seems like there might be an error in my reasoning.

Let me re-examine the constraints:

From COVEN: E is in the word but not in position 4
From NOBLE: E is in the word but not in position 5
Therefore E can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3
But position 2 is O, position 3 is N (from N must be in position 3), so E must be in position 1

Thus the word must be E O N _ _

But there seems to be no valid 5-letter English word that starts with EON and has a valid fifth letter from the remaining allowed letters.

This suggests I may have made an error in deducing N must be in position 3.

Let me re-examine N's placement:

From DOING: N is in the word but not in position 4
From NOBLE: N is in the word but not in position 1
Thus N can be in positions 2, 3, or 5
But position 2 is O, so N can be in positions 3 or 5

Previously I thought N must be in position 3 because it couldn't be in 5, but actually:
- From DOING: N not in 4
- From NOBLE: N not in 1
So N could be in 3 or 5

This changes things. Let me re-examine.

Current constraints:
1. Pattern: _ O _ _ _  (O in position 2)
2. Letters known:
   - E must be in word, not in 4 or 5 → E must be in 1 or 3
   - N must be in word, not in 1 or 4 → N must be in 3 or 5
3. Letters excluded: A, R, S, D, I, G, C, V, B, L

Case 1: N in position 3
   Then pattern: _ O N _ _
   E must be in position 1 (since 3 is taken by N and 4,5 are excluded for E)
   So word: E O N _ _
   Need a valid 5-letter word starting with EON and ending with any allowed letter.

Possible letters for position 5: F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y
Looking for common words:
- EONIC – I is excluded
- EONED – D is excluded
- EONEY – Y is allowed, but EONEY is not a valid word
- EONUM – not a word
- EONUT – not a word
- EONIC – excluded
- EONIC – excluded

This seems problematic. Maybe E is in position 3 and N in position 5?

Case 2: N in position 5
   Then pattern: _ O _ _ N
   E must be in position 1 or 3
   If E is in position 1: E O _ _ N
   Need a valid word E O _ _ N with allowed letters.

Possible letters for positions 3,4: from remaining allowed letters F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y

Looking for common words:
- EOTWN – not a word
- EOPHN – not a word
- EOTFN – not a word
- EOTKN – not a word
- EOTMN – not a word
- EOTPN – not a word
- EOTUN – not a word
- EOTWN – not a word
- EOTYN – not a word

This also seems problematic.

Wait, let me check if I missed any letters. The excluded letters are: A, R, S, D, I, G, C, V, B, L

Remaining consonants: F, H, K, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U

Looking back at Case 1: E O N _ _
The only possible word seems to be EONIC, but I is excluded. Is there any other word?

Actually, ""EONIC"" is the only common word starting with EON, but I is excluded. This suggests there might be no valid word under these constraints, which can't be right.

Let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

From COVEN: V(x) – V is excluded
From NOBLE: B(x), L(x) – B and L are excluded
From DOING: I(x) – I is excluded
From AROSE: A(x), R(x), S(x) – A, R, S are excluded
From Guess 1: A(x), R(x), S(x) – same
From Guess 2: D(x), I(x), G(x) – same
From Guess 3: C(x), V(x) – same

So excluded letters: A, R, S, D, I, G, C, V, B, L

Remaining letters: E, N, O, plus F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y

Pattern: _ O _ _ _ with E and N somewhere, and no excluded letters.

Let me try to list possible words:

E O N _ _ : EONIC (invalid), EONUM (invalid), etc. – none seem valid.

_ O _ _ _ with E and N:

Possible positions:
- E in 1, N in 3: E O N _ _
- E in 1, N in 5: E O _ _ N
- E in 3, N in 5: _ O E _ N

Let's check each:

1. E O N _ _ : no valid words
2. E O _ _ N : need letters for 3,4 from F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y
   Possible: E O F T N – not a word
   E O M P N – not a word
   E O T H N – not a word
   E O P H N – not a word
   E O U N – too short
3. _ O E _ N : need first and fourth letters from remaining
   Possible: M O E N – too short
   F O E N – not a word
   H O E N – not a word
   K O E N – not a word
   P O E N – not a word
   T O E N – not a word
   W O E N – not a word
   Y O E N – not a word

This is very concerning. It appears there might be an error in my deduction.

Wait, let me check if ""EONIC"" is actually a valid word. Yes, ""eonic"" is an adjective meaning relating to the eon, but it's quite rare. However, ""EONIC"" might not be in standard word lists.

Another possibility: ""EONIC"" might not be valid, so let me think of other words.

Actually, ""EONIC"" is the only common word starting with EON, but since I is excluded, this is invalid.

This suggests I need to re-examine if N must be in position 3.

Let me try N in position 5 and E in position 3:

Pattern: _ O E _ N
Need first and fourth letters from remaining: F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y

Possible words:
- FOGEN – not a word
- HOKEN – not a word
- MOKEN – not a word
- POKEN – not a word
- TOKEN – valid word! (a coin or token)
- FOKEN – not a word
- HOKEN – not a word
- WOKEN – valid word (past participle of wake)
- YOKEN – not a word

Between TOKEN and WOKEN, both fit the pattern _ O E _ N and use allowed letters.

Let me check:
- TOKEN: T, O, K, E, N – all allowed letters
- WOKEN: W, O, K, E, N – all allowed letters

Both are valid. I'll choose TOKEN.

But let me verify:
- O is in position 2 ✓
- E is in position 4 – but from COVEN and NOBLE, E must be in the word but not in positions 4 or 5. This would place E in position 4, which is invalid.

Ah, here's the mistake! From COVEN: E is in the word but not in position 4
From NOBLE: E is in the word but not in position 5
Therefore E can only be in positions 1 or 3

In the pattern _ O E _ N, E is in position 3 – this is allowed.

So the word would be _ O E _ N with first and fourth letters from remaining.

Possible words:
- FOGEN – not a word
- HOKEN – not a word
- MOKEN – not a word
- POKEN – not a word
- TOKEN – valid
- WOKEN – valid
- YOKEN – not a word

Between TOKEN and WOKEN, both fit:
- TOKEN: T, O, K, E, N – all allowed
- WOKEN: W, O, K, E, N – all allowed

I'll choose TOKEN.

But let me check if there's any other possibility.

Another possibility: N in position 3 and E in position 1: E O N _ _
Need a valid word E O N _ _ with allowed letters.

Possible letters for position 5: F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y

- EONIC – I excluded
- EONUM – not a word
- EONUT – not a word
- EONKF – not a word
- EONHF – not a word
- EONMF – not a word
- EONPF – not a word
- EONTF – not a word
- EONUF – not a word
- EONWF – not a word
- EONYF – not a word

This seems impossible. Therefore, the only valid word appears to be TOKEN or WOKEN.

Between the two, ""TOKEN"" is more common.

Thus, the next guess is TOKEN.

This suggests there might be no valid word under these constraints, which can\'t be right.\n\nLet me re-examine the feedback carefully:\n\nFrom COVEN: V(x) – V is excluded\nFrom NOBLE: B(x), L(x) – B and L are excluded\nFrom DOING: I(x) – I is excluded\nFrom AROSE: A(x), R(x), S(x) – A, R, S are excluded\nFrom Guess 1: A(x), R(x), S(x) – same\nFrom Guess 2: D(x), I(x), G(x) – same\nFrom Guess 3: C(x), V(x) – same\n\nSo excluded letters: A, R, S, D, I, G, C, V, B, L\n\nRemaining letters: E, N, O, plus F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y\n\nPattern: _ O _ _ _ with E and N somewhere, and no excluded letters.\n\nLet me try to list possible words:\n\nE O N _ _ : EONIC (invalid), EONUM (invalid), etc. – none seem valid.\n\n_ O _ _ _ with E and N:\n\nPossible positions:\n- E in 1, N in 3: E O N _ _\n- E in 1, N in 5: E O _ _ N\n- E in 3, N in 5: _ O E _ N\n\nLet\'s check each:\n\n1. E O N _ _ : no valid words\n2. E O _ _ N : need letters for 3,4 from F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y\n   Possible: E O F T N – not a word\n   E O M P N – not a word\n   E O T H N – not a word\n   E O P H N – not a word\n   E O U N – too short\n3. _ O E _ N : need first and fourth letters from remaining\n   Possible: M O E N – too short\n   F O E N – not a word\n   H O E N – not a word\n   K O E N – not a word\n   P O E N – not a word\n   T O E N – not a word\n   W O E N – not a word\n   Y O E N – not a word\n\nThis is very concerning. It appears there might be an error in my deduction.\n\nWait, let me check if ""EONIC"" is actually a valid word. Yes, ""eonic"" is an adjective meaning relating to the eon, but it\'s quite rare. However, ""EONIC"" might not be in standard word lists.\n\nAnother possibility: ""EONIC"" might not be valid, so let me think of other words.\n\nActually, ""EONIC"" is the only common word starting with EON, but since I is excluded, this is invalid.\n\nThis suggests I need to re-examine if N must be in position 3.\n\nLet me try N in position 5 and E in position 3:\n\nPattern: _ O E _ N\nNeed first and fourth letters from remaining: F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y\n\nPossible words:\n- FOGEN – not a word\n- HOKEN – not a word\n- MOKEN – not a word\n- POKEN – not a word\n- TOKEN – valid word! (a coin or token)\n- FOKEN – not a word\n- HOKEN – not a word\n- WOKEN – valid word (past participle of wake)\n- YOKEN – not a word\n\nBetween TOKEN and WOKEN, both fit the pattern _ O E _ N and use allowed letters.\n\nLet me check:\n- TOKEN: T, O, K, E, N – all allowed letters\n- WOKEN: W, O, K, E, N – all allowed letters\n\nBoth are valid. I\'ll choose TOKEN.\n\nBut let me verify:\n- O is in position 2 ✓\n- E is in position 4 – but from COVEN and NOBLE, E must be in the word but not in positions 4 or 5. This would place E in position 4, which is invalid.\n\nAh, here\'s the mistake! From COVEN: E is in the word but not in position 4\nFrom NOBLE: E is in the word but not in position 5\nTherefore E can only be in positions 1 or 3\n\nIn the pattern _ O E _ N, E is in position 3 – this is allowed.\n\nSo the word would be _ O E _ N with first and fourth letters from remaining.\n\nPossible words:\n- FOGEN – not a word\n- HOKEN – not a word\n- MOKEN – not a word\n- POKEN – not a word\n- TOKEN – valid\n- WOKEN – valid\n- YOKEN – not a word\n\nBetween TOKEN and WOKEN, both fit:\n- TOKEN: T, O, K, E, N – all allowed\n- WOKEN: W, O, K, E, N – all allowed\n\nI\'ll choose TOKEN.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s any other possibility.\n\nAnother possibility: N in position 3 and E in position 1: E O N _ _\nNeed a valid word E O N _ _ with allowed letters.\n\nPossible letters for position 5: F, H, K, M, P, T, U, W, Y\n\n- EONIC – I excluded\n- EONUM – not a word\n- EONUT – not a word\n- EONKF – not a word\n- EONHF – not a word\n- EONMF – not a word\n- EONPF – not a word\n- EONTF – not a word\n- EONUF – not a word\n- EONWF – not a word\n- EONYF – not a word\n\nThis seems impossible. Therefore, the only valid word appears to be TOKEN or WOKEN.\n\nBetween the two, ""TOKEN"" is more common.\n\nThus, the next guess is TOKEN.\n\n<guess>TOKEN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: DOING -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) G(x)\nGuess 3: COVEN -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) V(x) E(✓) N(-)\nGuess 4: NOBLE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(✓) B(x) L(x) E(-)\nGuess 5: TOKEN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓) N(-)\n'}]","<think>
Let’s consolidate everything we now know after five guesses.

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 2: O (✓ from every guess)
   - Position 4: E (✓ from COVEN and TOKEN)

2. Letters known to be in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - N (must be in the word; it was “-” in DOING, NOBLE, TOKEN, so it cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5. Positions 2 and 3 are already taken by O and E, so N must be in position 3.)

3. Letters known NOT to be in the word (from every “x”):
   A, R, S, D, I, G, C, V, B, L, T, K

4. Therefore the pattern is now:
   _ O N E _

5. We still need to fill positions 1 and 5 with letters that:
   - have not been excluded (allowed letters left: F, H, M, P, U, W, Y, plus the already-placed O, N, E)
   - form a valid 5-letter English word.

   Possible combinations:
   - Position 1: F, H, M, P, U, W, Y
   - Position 5: F, H, M, P, U, W, Y (but must make a valid word)

   Valid English words that fit:
   - F O N E Y  (FONEY) – not a standard word
   - H O N E Y  (HONEY) – valid word
   - M O N E Y  (MONET) – but T is excluded, so MONET is invalid; MONEY is valid but T is excluded, so MONEY is invalid (T is excluded)
   - P O N E Y  (PONEY) – archaic spelling of pony; not standard
   - W O N E Y  – not a word
   - Y O N E Y  – not a word

   The only common word left is HONEY.

   Check letters:
   H – not excluded
   O – already in position 2
   N – already in position 3
   E – already in position 4
   Y – not excluded

   HONEY satisfies every constraint.
