### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many letters quickly. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the correct position (1st letter = A).
- R is NOT in the word at all.
- O is NOT in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so somewhere else besides 4th).
- E is NOT in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word starts with A.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E.
- S is somewhere in the word but not in position 4.

I need a 5-letter word starting with A that contains S (but not in position 4) and does NOT contain R, O, or E.

Possible letters left (excluding R, O, E): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want to test new common letters. Good candidates are S, T, I, N, L, C, etc.

A good next guess would use S in a new position and test other common letters. “AUDIO” is invalid because it contains O. “ASIDE” is invalid because it contains E. “ASPIN” contains P and N, but S is in position 2 (new position). “ASPIN” is a valid word.

Let’s try “ASPIN”:
- Starts with A (matches known position).
- Contains S (in position 2, new position).
- Uses P and N to test new letters.
- Does not contain R, O, or E.

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 1.
   - S is somewhere in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word at all.

2. aspin → A(✓) S(-) P(x) I(-) N(x)
   - A is still correct in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 2 (because it got “-” there).
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - P and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- First letter = A
- S is in the word, but not in positions 2 or 4 → possible positions: 3 or 5
- I is in the word, but not in position 4 → possible positions: 2, 3, 5
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, P, N
- Still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good next letters to test: T, L, C, D, G, H, K, M, U, Y, etc.

I’ll try a word that places S in position 3 and I in position 2, using common remaining letters.  
A common pattern is A _ S _ _, and I in position 2 fits: A I S _ _.

A valid word fitting this: “AISLE”  
- A(1) ✓, I(2), S(3), L(4), E(5)  
But E is already eliminated (from arose feedback). So “aisle” is invalid.

Next option: “ACIDS”  
- A(1) ✓, C(2), I(3), D(4), S(5)  
- S is now in position 5 (new position).  
- Uses C and D which are untested.  
- Contains no forbidden letters (R, O, E, P, N).

This seems good.
