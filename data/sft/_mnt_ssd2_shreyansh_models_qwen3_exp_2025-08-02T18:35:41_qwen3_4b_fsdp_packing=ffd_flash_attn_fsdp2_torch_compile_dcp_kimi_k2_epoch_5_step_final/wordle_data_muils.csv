For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should contain frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than the 4th position.
2. Does not use A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong candidate is ""STUNG"":
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so this satisfies the feedback).
- Uses T, U, N, G - none of which were ruled out.
- Includes U (a common vowel) and N, T, G (common consonants).

This should give good coverage.

- Letters that are out: A, R, O, E, T, N, G  
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4.  
- U cannot be in position 3.

- U must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Wait, we need exactly 5 letters. Let’s try “USUAL” – but that’s 5 letters and fits: U S U A L, but A is eliminated.

Another approach: S in position 3, U in position 1 → U _ S _ _
Letters left: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
A word: U P S _ _ – but we need two more letters. “UPSID” – but D is allowed, but we need a valid word.

Better: U L S I D – but D is allowed, but “ULSID” is not a valid English word.

Another approach: S in position 3, U in position 1 → U _ S _ _
Letters left: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
A word: U P S _ _ – but we need two more letters. “UPSID” – but D is allowed, but we need a valid word.

Better: U L S I D – but D is allowed, but “ULSID” is not a valid English word.

Let’s try S in position 5: _ _ _ _ S
With U somewhere in 1,2,4:
Example: C H U R S – but R is eliminated.

Another candidate: S in position 3, U in position 5 → _ _ S _ U
Letters: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
A valid word: “CHIPS” – but we need U, so that’s not helpful.

Let’s try S in position 2, U in position 4 → _ S _ U _
Letters left: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
A word: “BLUSH” – but H is allowed, B and L are allowed, but we need to check:
B, L, U, S, H – none of these are eliminated. This is valid.

Check positions:
- S is in position 2 (allowed, since S cannot be in 1 or 4)
- U is in position 4 (allowed, since U cannot be in 3)
- All other letters (B, L, H) are from the allowed set.

“BLUSH” seems like a good next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we know after three guesses.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word (eliminated):
   A, R, O, E, T, N, G, B, H

2. Letters that ARE in the word (must appear at least once):
   S, U, L

3. Position constraints:
   - S cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from STUNG and BLUSH feedback).
     So S must be in position 2 or 3.
   - U cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from STUNG and BLUSH feedback).
     So U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
   - L cannot be in position 2 (from BLUSH feedback).
     So L must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

4. Allowed letters (not yet eliminated):
   C, D, F, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the required S, U, L.

5. We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
   - Contains S, U, L exactly once each.
   - Places S only in position 2 or 3.
   - Places U only in position 1, 2, or 5.
   - Places L only in position 3, 4, or 5.
   - Uses only the allowed letters.

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: S in position 2
   _ S _ _ _
   Then U must be in 1, 4, or 5 (but 4 and 5 are open).
   L must be in 3, 4, or 5.
   Possible patterns:
   - U S L _ _  → but L would be in 3 (allowed)
   - _ S U L _  → but U in 3 is forbidden (from STUNG feedback)
   - _ S _ L U  → U in 5 (allowed), L in 4 (allowed)
   - _ S L U _  → L in 3 (allowed), U in 4 (allowed)

Case 2: S in position 3
   _ _ S _ _
   Then U must be in 1 or 2 (since 5 is open, but L would need to fit too).
   L must be in 4 or 5 (since 3 is S).

Let’s explore Case 1 first:

But U in 4 is forbidden (from STUNG feedback: U cannot be in 3 or 4).

Pattern: _ S _ L U  (S in 2, L in 4, U in 5)
Letters left to fill: positions 1 and 3.
Allowed letters: C, D, F, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y.
We need a valid word.

   - Y U S _ L → “YUS _L” – not a word.

Still no valid words.

Let’s try a different approach: look for common 5-letter words that contain S, U, L and fit the constraints.

Possible valid English words that contain S, U, L:
- SLUMP – but M and P are allowed, but U is in 3 (forbidden).
- SLUSH – but S is repeated, and U is in 3 (forbidden).
- STUNS – but T and N are eliminated.
- SULKY – but K and Y are allowed, and positions:
   S U L K Y → S in 1 (forbidden), U in 2 (allowed), L in 3 (allowed), K in 4 (allowed), Y in 5 (allowed).
   But S in 1 is forbidden (from BLUSH feedback: S cannot be in 1).

- CLUCK – but C, L, U, C, K – but S is missing.
- SLUMP – already noted.
- SLUMS – but S is repeated, and S in 1 is forbidden.

- LUSKY – but S is in 3 (allowed), U in 2 (allowed), L in 1 (allowed), K in 4 (allowed), Y in 5 (allowed).
   L U S K Y – this fits:
   - S in 3 (allowed)
   - U in 2 (allowed)
   - L in 1 (allowed)
   - K and Y are allowed letters.

""LUSKY"" is a valid English word (though uncommon, it's listed in some dictionaries).

Let’s check constraints:
- Letters: L, U, S, K, Y – none are eliminated.
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since S cannot be in 1,4,5).
- U is in position 2 (allowed, since U cannot be in 3 or 4).
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since L cannot be in 2).
- K and Y are new letters, giving more information.

""LUSKY"" seems like the best candidate.

</think>

Based on the feedback, the secret word must contain S, U, and L, with specific positional restrictions. After careful analysis, the word ""LUSKY"" fits all constraints:

- L (position 1) – allowed (not in position 2)
- U (position 2) – allowed (not in 3 or 4)
- S (position 3) – allowed (not in 1, 4, or 5)
- K and Y are new letters to test.

   S U L K Y → S in 1 (forbidden), U in 2 (allowed), L in 3 (allowed), K in 4 (allowed), Y in 5 (allowed).

   L U S K Y – this fits:
   - S in 3 (allowed)
   - U in 2 (allowed)
   - L in 1 (allowed)
   - K and Y are allowed letters.

""LUSKY"" is a valid English word (though uncommon, it's listed in some dictionaries).

Let’s check constraints:
- Letters: L, U, S, K, Y – none are eliminated.
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since S cannot be in 1,4,5).
- U is in position 2 (allowed, since U cannot be in 3 or 4).
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since L cannot be in 2).
- K and Y are new letters, giving more information.

""LUSKY"" seems like the best candidate.Based on the feedback, the secret word must contain S, U, and L, with specific positional restrictions. After careful analysis, the word ""LUSKY"" fits all constraints:

- L (position 1) – allowed (not in position 2)
- U (position 2) – allowed (not in 3 or 4)
- S (position 3) – allowed (not in 1, 4, or 5)
- K and Y are new letters to test.",Guess 4: LUSKY -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(✓) S(-) K(x) Y(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should contain frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than the 4th position.
2. Does not use A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong candidate is ""STUNG"":
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so this satisfies the feedback).
- Uses T, U, N, G - none of which were ruled out.
- Includes U (a common vowel) and N, T, G (common consonants).

This should give good coverage.

Guess 2: STUNG -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) U(-) N(x) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, E  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Round 2: STUNG → S(-) T(x) U(-) N(x) G(x)  
- Eliminated letters: T, N, G  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Summary of what we know:
- Letters that must appear: S, U  
- Letters that are out: A, R, O, E, T, N, G  
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4.  
- U cannot be in position 3.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: I (since U is already confirmed and we’ve ruled out A, E, O)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and U.  
- S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
- U must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Let’s try to place S and U while filling the remaining slots with common allowed letters.

Option: S in position 2, U in position 1 → U S _ _ _
We need three more letters from B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

A common pattern: U S C _ _
Let’s pick “USC” and add two more consonants. A good word: “USUAL” – but we need only 5 letters and we already have U and S.

Wait, we need exactly 5 letters. Let’s try “USUAL” – but that’s 5 letters and fits: U S U A L, but A is eliminated.

Another approach: S in position 3, U in position 1 → U _ S _ _
Letters left: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
A word: U P S _ _ – but we need two more letters. “UPSID” – but D is allowed, but we need a valid word.

Better: U L S I D – but D is allowed, but “ULSID” is not a valid English word.

Let’s try S in position 5: _ _ _ _ S
With U somewhere in 1,2,4:
Example: C H U R S – but R is eliminated.

Another candidate: S in position 3, U in position 5 → _ _ S _ U
Letters: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
A valid word: “CHIPS” – but we need U, so that’s not helpful.

Let’s try S in position 2, U in position 4 → _ S _ U _
Letters left: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
A word: “BLUSH” – but H is allowed, B and L are allowed, but we need to check:
B, L, U, S, H – none of these are eliminated. This is valid.

Check positions:
- S is in position 2 (allowed, since S cannot be in 1 or 4)
- U is in position 4 (allowed, since U cannot be in 3)
- All other letters (B, L, H) are from the allowed set.

“BLUSH” seems like a good next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we know after three guesses.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word (eliminated):
   A, R, O, E, T, N, G, B, H

2. Letters that ARE in the word (must appear at least once):
   S, U, L

3. Position constraints:
   - S cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from STUNG and BLUSH feedback).
     So S must be in position 2 or 3.
   - U cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from STUNG and BLUSH feedback).
     So U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
   - L cannot be in position 2 (from BLUSH feedback).
     So L must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

4. Allowed letters (not yet eliminated):
   C, D, F, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the required S, U, L.

5. We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
   - Contains S, U, L exactly once each.
   - Places S only in position 2 or 3.
   - Places U only in position 1, 2, or 5.
   - Places L only in position 3, 4, or 5.
   - Uses only the allowed letters.

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: S in position 2
   _ S _ _ _
   Then U must be in 1, 4, or 5 (but 4 and 5 are open).
   L must be in 3, 4, or 5.
   Possible patterns:
   - U S L _ _  → but L would be in 3 (allowed)
   - _ S U L _  → but U in 3 is forbidden (from STUNG feedback)
   - _ S _ L U  → U in 5 (allowed), L in 4 (allowed)
   - _ S L U _  → L in 3 (allowed), U in 4 (allowed)

Case 2: S in position 3
   _ _ S _ _
   Then U must be in 1 or 2 (since 5 is open, but L would need to fit too).
   L must be in 4 or 5 (since 3 is S).

Let’s explore Case 1 first:

Pattern: _ S L U _  (S in 2, L in 3, U in 4)
But U in 4 is forbidden (from STUNG feedback: U cannot be in 3 or 4).

Pattern: _ S _ L U  (S in 2, L in 4, U in 5)
Letters left to fill: positions 1 and 3.
Allowed letters: C, D, F, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y.
We need a valid word.

Possible combinations:
- C S I L U → “CSI LU” – not a word.
- D S I L U → “DSILU” – not a word.
- F S I L U → “FSILU” – not a word.
- M S I L U → “MSILU” – not a word.
- P S I L U → “PSILU” – not a word.
- V S I L U → “VSILU” – not a word.
- W S I L U → “WSILU” – not a word.
- Y S I L U → “YSILU” – not a word.

None of these seem to form valid English words.

Pattern: U S L _ _  (S in 2, L in 3, U in 1)
Then positions 4 and 5 are open.
Letters: U S L _ _
Possible valid words:
- U S L I D → “USLID” – not a word.
- U S L I C → “USLIC” – not a word.
- U S L I N → but N is eliminated.
- U S L I M → “USLIM” – not a word.
- U S L I K → “USLIK” – not a word.
- U S L I P → “USLIP” – not a word.
- U S L I V → “USLIV” – not a word.
- U S L I Y → “USLIY” – not a word.

No valid words here.

Pattern: _ S _ L U  (S in 2, L in 4, U in 5)
Positions 1 and 3 open.
Letters: _ S _ L U
Possible valid words:
- C S I L U → “CSI LU” – not a word.
- D S I L U → “DSILU” – not a word.
- F S I L U → “FSILU” – not a word.
- M S I L U → “MSILU” – not a word.
- P S I L U → “PSILU” – not a word.
- V S I L U → “VSILU” – not a word.
- W S I L U → “WSILU” – not a word.
- Y S I L U → “YSILU” – not a word.

No valid words.

Pattern: _ S U L _  (S in 2, U in 3) – but U in 3 is forbidden.

Case 2: S in position 3
   _ _ S _ _
   Then U must be in 1 or 2 (since 5 is open, but L would need to fit too).
   L must be in 4 or 5 (since 3 is S).

Subcase 2a: U in 1
   U _ S _ _
   L must be in 4 or 5.
   Possible patterns:
   - U M S L _ → “UMS L_” – need a valid word.
   - U M S _ L → “UMS _L” – need a valid word.
   - U C S L _ → “UCS L_” – not a word.
   - U C S _ L → “UCS _L” – not a word.
   - U D S L _ → “UDS L_” – not a word.
   - U D S _ L → “UDS _L” – not a word.
   - U F S L _ → “UFS L_” – not a word.
   - U F S _ L → “UFS _L” – not a word.
   - U I S L _ → “UI S L_” – not a word.
   - U I S _ L → “UI S _L” – not a word.
   - U K S L _ → “UKS L_” – not a word.
   - U K S _ L → “UKS _L” – not a word.
   - U M S L _ → “UMS L_” – not a word.
   - U M S _ L → “UMS _L” – not a word.
   - U P S L _ → “UPS L_” – not a word.
   - U P S _ L → “UPS _L” – not a word.
   - U V S L _ → “UVS L_” – not a word.
   - U V S _ L → “UVS _L” – not a word.
   - U W S L _ → “UWS L_” – not a word.
   - U W S _ L → “UWS _L” – not a word.
   - U Y S L _ → “UY S L_” – not a word.
   - U Y S _ L → “UY S _L” – not a word.

None of these seem to form valid English words.

Subcase 2b: U in 2
   _ U S _ _
   L must be in 4 or 5.
   Possible patterns:
   - C U S L _ → “CUS L_” – not a word.
   - D U S L _ → “DUS L_” – not a word.
   - F U S L _ → “FUS L_” – not a word.
   - I U S L _ → “IUS L_” – not a word.
   - K U S L _ → “KUS L_” – not a word.
   - M U S L _ → “MUS L_” – not a word.
   - P U S L _ → “PUS L_” – not a word.
   - V U S L _ → “VUS L_” – not a word.
   - W U S L _ → “WUS L_” – not a word.
   - Y U S L _ → “YUS L_” – not a word.
   - C U S _ L → “CUS _L” – not a word.
   - D U S _ L → “DUS _L” – not a word.
   - F U S _ L → “FUS _L” – not a word.
   - I U S _ L → “IUS _L” – not a word.
   - K U S _ L → “KUS _L” – not a word.
   - M U S _ L → “MUS _L” – not a word.
   - P U S _ L → “PUS _L” – not a word.
   - V U S _ L → “VUS _L” – not a word.
   - W U S _ L → “WUS _L” – not a word.
   - Y U S _ L → “YUS _L” – not a word.

Still no valid words.

Let’s try a different approach: look for common 5-letter words that contain S, U, L and fit the constraints.

Possible valid English words that contain S, U, L:
- SLUMP – but M and P are allowed, but U is in 3 (forbidden).
- SLUSH – but S is repeated, and U is in 3 (forbidden).
- STUNS – but T and N are eliminated.
- SULKY – but K and Y are allowed, and positions:
   S U L K Y → S in 1 (forbidden), U in 2 (allowed), L in 3 (allowed), K in 4 (allowed), Y in 5 (allowed).
   But S in 1 is forbidden (from BLUSH feedback: S cannot be in 1).

- CLUCK – but C, L, U, C, K – but S is missing.
- SLUMP – already noted.
- SLUMS – but S is repeated, and S in 1 is forbidden.

- LUSKY – but S is in 3 (allowed), U in 2 (allowed), L in 1 (allowed), K in 4 (allowed), Y in 5 (allowed).
   L U S K Y – this fits:
   - S in 3 (allowed)
   - U in 2 (allowed)
   - L in 1 (allowed)
   - K and Y are allowed letters.

""LUSKY"" is a valid English word (though uncommon, it's listed in some dictionaries).

Let’s check constraints:
- Letters: L, U, S, K, Y – none are eliminated.
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since S cannot be in 1,4,5).
- U is in position 2 (allowed, since U cannot be in 3 or 4).
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since L cannot be in 2).
- K and Y are new letters, giving more information.

""LUSKY"" seems like the best candidate.Based on the feedback, the secret word must contain S, U, and L, with specific positional restrictions. After careful analysis, the word ""LUSKY"" fits all constraints:

- L (position 1) – allowed (not in position 2)
- U (position 2) – allowed (not in 3 or 4)
- S (position 3) – allowed (not in 1, 4, or 5)
- K and Y are new letters to test.

From the latest feedback on LUSKY:
- L(-) – L is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 1).
- U(✓) – U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 3).
- K(x) – K is not in the word.
- Y(x) – Y is not in the word.

So the secret word has:
- U fixed in position 2.
- Must contain L and S somewhere, but:
  – L cannot be in position 1.
  – S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from earlier feedback: S was wrong in 1, 3, 4, 5).
  – Therefore S must be in position 2, but position 2 is already U.  
    This contradiction shows our assumption is wrong.

Wait, let’s re-examine the positional bans on S:
- From STUNG: S was wrong in position 1.
- From BLUSH: S was wrong in position 4.
- From LUSKY: S was wrong in position 3.
So S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
The only remaining slot for S is position 2, but position 2 is already U(✓).  
This is impossible unless the word has two U’s, but we have no evidence of that.

Therefore, the only resolution is that the word must be of the form:
_ U _ _ _ with S and L somewhere, but S cannot fit.  
This suggests an earlier interpretation error.

Rechecking the feedback:
- LUSKY feedback: L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 1.
- U(✓) means U is in position 2.
- S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 3.
- K(x) and Y(x) are new eliminations.

So the word is _ U _ _ _ and must contain L and S, with:
- L not in position 1.
- S not in position 3.

Possible positions:
- L can be in 3, 4, or 5.
- S can be in 2 (but 2 is U), 4, or 5.

But 2 is U, so S must be in 4 or 5.
L must be in 3, 4, or 5, but cannot overlap with S.

Let’s list possibilities:
1. _ U L S _ → S in 4, L in 3.  
   Need first and last letters from remaining allowed: C, D, F, I, M, P, V, W.
   Valid word: CULPS – but P is allowed, C, U, L, P, S.  
   Check constraints:
   - C (allowed), U (correct), L (allowed), P (allowed), S (allowed).  
   - S is in 4 (allowed), L is in 3 (allowed).

2. _ U L _ S → L in 3, S in 5.  
   First and fourth letters from allowed: C, D, F, I, M, P, V, W.  
   Valid word: CULMS – but M is allowed, C, U, L, M, S.  
   Check: C, U, L, M, S – all allowed, positions fit.

3. _ U _ L S → L in 4, S in 5.  
   First and third letters from allowed.  
   Valid word: CUPLS – but P is allowed, C, U, P, L, S.  
   Check: C, U, P, L, S – all allowed, positions fit.

Among these, ""CULPS"" is a valid English word (plural of cull), and fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- C (allowed)
- U (correct in position 2)
- L (in word, not in position 1 – here in 3, ok)
- P (allowed)
- S (in word, not in position 3 – here in 5, ok)

No conflicts.

The feedback shows that:
- U is fixed in position 2.
- L is in the word but not in position 1.
- S is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from earlier guesses).
- Positions 1, 3, 4, 5 must be filled with remaining allowed letters (C, D, F, I, M, P, V, W).

The only possible placement for S is position 2, but position 2 is already U. This contradiction implies S must be in position 5 (since earlier bans only excluded 1,3,4). Thus, L must be in 3, 4, or 5, but 5 is taken by S, so L must be in 3 or 4.

The valid word that fits is ""CULPS"":

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should contain frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than the 4th position.
2. Does not use A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A strong candidate is ""STUNG"":
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so this satisfies the feedback).
- Uses T, U, N, G - none of which were ruled out.
- Includes U (a common vowel) and N, T, G (common consonants).

This should give good coverage.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, E  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Round 2: STUNG → S(-) T(x) U(-) N(x) G(x)  
- Eliminated letters: T, N, G  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Summary of what we know:
- Letters that must appear: S, U  
- Letters that are out: A, R, O, E, T, N, G  
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4.  
- U cannot be in position 3.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: I (since U is already confirmed and we’ve ruled out A, E, O)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and U.  
- S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
- U must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Let’s try to place S and U while filling the remaining slots with common allowed letters.

Option: S in position 2, U in position 1 → U S _ _ _
We need three more letters from B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

A common pattern: U S C _ _
Let’s pick “USC” and add two more consonants. A good word: “USUAL” – but we need only 5 letters and we already have U and S.

Wait, we need exactly 5 letters. Let’s try “USUAL” – but that’s 5 letters and fits: U S U A L, but A is eliminated.

Another approach: S in position 3, U in position 1 → U _ S _ _
Letters left: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
A word: U P S _ _ – but we need two more letters. “UPSID” – but D is allowed, but we need a valid word.

Better: U L S I D – but D is allowed, but “ULSID” is not a valid English word.

Let’s try S in position 5: _ _ _ _ S
With U somewhere in 1,2,4:
Example: C H U R S – but R is eliminated.

Another candidate: S in position 3, U in position 5 → _ _ S _ U
Letters: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
A valid word: “CHIPS” – but we need U, so that’s not helpful.

Let’s try S in position 2, U in position 4 → _ S _ U _
Letters left: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
A word: “BLUSH” – but H is allowed, B and L are allowed, but we need to check:
B, L, U, S, H – none of these are eliminated. This is valid.

Check positions:
- S is in position 2 (allowed, since S cannot be in 1 or 4)
- U is in position 4 (allowed, since U cannot be in 3)
- All other letters (B, L, H) are from the allowed set.

“BLUSH” seems like a good next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we know after three guesses.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word (eliminated):
   A, R, O, E, T, N, G, B, H

2. Letters that ARE in the word (must appear at least once):
   S, U, L

3. Position constraints:
   - S cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from STUNG and BLUSH feedback).
     So S must be in position 2 or 3.
   - U cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from STUNG and BLUSH feedback).
     So U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
   - L cannot be in position 2 (from BLUSH feedback).
     So L must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

4. Allowed letters (not yet eliminated):
   C, D, F, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the required S, U, L.

5. We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
   - Contains S, U, L exactly once each.
   - Places S only in position 2 or 3.
   - Places U only in position 1, 2, or 5.
   - Places L only in position 3, 4, or 5.
   - Uses only the allowed letters.

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: S in position 2
   _ S _ _ _
   Then U must be in 1, 4, or 5 (but 4 and 5 are open).
   L must be in 3, 4, or 5.
   Possible patterns:
   - U S L _ _  → but L would be in 3 (allowed)
   - _ S U L _  → but U in 3 is forbidden (from STUNG feedback)
   - _ S _ L U  → U in 5 (allowed), L in 4 (allowed)
   - _ S L U _  → L in 3 (allowed), U in 4 (allowed)

Case 2: S in position 3
   _ _ S _ _
   Then U must be in 1 or 2 (since 5 is open, but L would need to fit too).
   L must be in 4 or 5 (since 3 is S).

Let’s explore Case 1 first:

Pattern: _ S L U _  (S in 2, L in 3, U in 4)
But U in 4 is forbidden (from STUNG feedback: U cannot be in 3 or 4).

Pattern: _ S _ L U  (S in 2, L in 4, U in 5)
Letters left to fill: positions 1 and 3.
Allowed letters: C, D, F, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y.
We need a valid word.

Possible combinations:
- C S I L U → “CSI LU” – not a word.

None of these seem to form valid English words.

Pattern: U S L _ _  (S in 2, L in 3, U in 1)
Then positions 4 and 5 are open.
Letters: U S L _ _
Possible valid words:
- U S L I D → “USLID” – not a word.

No valid words.

Pattern: _ S U L _  (S in 2, U in 3) – but U in 3 is forbidden.

Case 2: S in position 3
   _ _ S _ _
   Then U must be in 1 or 2 (since 5 is open, but L would need to fit too).
   L must be in 4 or 5 (since 3 is S).

Subcase 2a: U in 1
   U _ S _ _
   L must be in 4 or 5.
   Possible patterns:
   - U M S L _ → “UMS L_” – need a valid word.
   - U M S _ L → “UMS _L” – need a valid word.
   - U C S L _ → “UCS L_” – not a word.
   - U C S _ L → “UCS _L” – not a word.
   - U D S L _ → “UDS L_” – not a word.
   - U D S _ L → “UDS _L” – not a word.
   - U F S L _ → “UFS L_” – not a word.

   - U Y S L _ → “UY S L_” – not a word.
   - U Y S _ L → “UY S _L” – not a word.

None of these seem to form valid English words.

Subcase 2b: U in 2
   _ U S _ _
   L must be in 4 or 5.
   Possible patterns:
   - C U S L _ → “CUS L_” – not a word.
   - D U S L _ → “DUS L_” – not a word.
   - F U S L _ → “FUS L_” – not a word.

   - W U S _ L → “WUS _L” – not a word.
   - Y U S _ L → “YUS _L” – not a word.

Still no valid words.

Let’s try a different approach: look for common 5-letter words that contain S, U, L and fit the constraints.

Possible valid English words that contain S, U, L:
- SLUMP – but M and P are allowed, but U is in 3 (forbidden).
- SLUSH – but S is repeated, and U is in 3 (forbidden).
- STUNS – but T and N are eliminated.
- SULKY – but K and Y are allowed, and positions:
   S U L K Y → S in 1 (forbidden), U in 2 (allowed), L in 3 (allowed), K in 4 (allowed), Y in 5 (allowed).
   But S in 1 is forbidden (from BLUSH feedback: S cannot be in 1).

- CLUCK – but C, L, U, C, K – but S is missing.
- SLUMP – already noted.
- SLUMS – but S is repeated, and S in 1 is forbidden.

- LUSKY – but S is in 3 (allowed), U in 2 (allowed), L in 1 (allowed), K in 4 (allowed), Y in 5 (allowed).
   L U S K Y – this fits:
   - S in 3 (allowed)
   - U in 2 (allowed)
   - L in 1 (allowed)
   - K and Y are allowed letters.

""LUSKY"" is a valid English word (though uncommon, it's listed in some dictionaries).

Let’s check constraints:
- Letters: L, U, S, K, Y – none are eliminated.
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since S cannot be in 1,4,5).
- U is in position 2 (allowed, since U cannot be in 3 or 4).
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since L cannot be in 2).
- K and Y are new letters, giving more information.

""LUSKY"" seems like the best candidate.Based on the feedback, the secret word must contain S, U, and L, with specific positional restrictions. After careful analysis, the word ""LUSKY"" fits all constraints:

- L (position 1) – allowed (not in position 2)
- U (position 2) – allowed (not in 3 or 4)
- S (position 3) – allowed (not in 1, 4, or 5)
- K and Y are new letters to test.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STUNG -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) U(-) N(x) G(x)
Guess 3: BLUSH -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) U(-) S(-) H(x)
Guess 4: LUSKY -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(✓) S(-) K(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on LUSKY:
- L(-) – L is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 1).
- U(✓) – U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 3).
- K(x) – K is not in the word.
- Y(x) – Y is not in the word.

So the secret word has:
- U fixed in position 2.
- Must contain L and S somewhere, but:
  – L cannot be in position 1.
  – S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from earlier feedback: S was wrong in 1, 3, 4, 5).
  – Therefore S must be in position 2, but position 2 is already U.  
    This contradiction shows our assumption is wrong.

Wait, let’s re-examine the positional bans on S:
- From STUNG: S was wrong in position 1.
- From BLUSH: S was wrong in position 4.
- From LUSKY: S was wrong in position 3.
So S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
The only remaining slot for S is position 2, but position 2 is already U(✓).  
This is impossible unless the word has two U’s, but we have no evidence of that.

Therefore, the only resolution is that the word must be of the form:
_ U _ _ _ with S and L somewhere, but S cannot fit.  
This suggests an earlier interpretation error.

Rechecking the feedback:
- LUSKY feedback: L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 1.
- U(✓) means U is in position 2.
- S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 3.
- K(x) and Y(x) are new eliminations.

So the word is _ U _ _ _ and must contain L and S, with:
- L not in position 1.
- S not in position 3.

Possible positions:
- L can be in 3, 4, or 5.
- S can be in 2 (but 2 is U), 4, or 5.

But 2 is U, so S must be in 4 or 5.
L must be in 3, 4, or 5, but cannot overlap with S.

Let’s list possibilities:
1. _ U L S _ → S in 4, L in 3.  
   Need first and last letters from remaining allowed: C, D, F, I, M, P, V, W.
   Valid word: CULPS – but P is allowed, C, U, L, P, S.  
   Check constraints:
   - C (allowed), U (correct), L (allowed), P (allowed), S (allowed).  
   - S is in 4 (allowed), L is in 3 (allowed).

2. _ U L _ S → L in 3, S in 5.  
   First and fourth letters from allowed: C, D, F, I, M, P, V, W.  
   Valid word: CULMS – but M is allowed, C, U, L, M, S.  
   Check: C, U, L, M, S – all allowed, positions fit.

3. _ U _ L S → L in 4, S in 5.  
   First and third letters from allowed.  
   Valid word: CUPLS – but P is allowed, C, U, P, L, S.  
   Check: C, U, P, L, S – all allowed, positions fit.

Among these, ""CULPS"" is a valid English word (plural of cull), and fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- C (allowed)
- U (correct in position 2)
- L (in word, not in position 1 – here in 3, ok)
- P (allowed)
- S (in word, not in position 3 – here in 5, ok)

No conflicts.The feedback shows that:
- U is fixed in position 2.
- L is in the word but not in position 1.
- S is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from earlier guesses).
- Positions 1, 3, 4, 5 must be filled with remaining allowed letters (C, D, F, I, M, P, V, W).

The only possible placement for S is position 2, but position 2 is already U. This contradiction implies S must be in position 5 (since earlier bans only excluded 1,3,4). Thus, L must be in 3, 4, or 5, but 5 is taken by S, so L must be in 3 or 4.

The valid word that fits is ""CULPS"":
- C (allowed)
- U (correct in position 2)
- L (position 3, allowed)
- P (allowed)
- S (position 5, allowed)

From the latest feedback on CULPS:
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- U(✓) – U is in position 2 (confirmed again).
- L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 3.
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in position 5 (correct).

So the secret word is:
- _ U _ _ S
- Must contain L, and L cannot be in position 1 (from LUSKY) or position 3 (from CULPS).  
  Therefore L must be in position 4.

Thus the word is:
- _ U _ L S

Remaining allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: D, F, I, M, V, W (and any others not yet ruled out).

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form ? U ? L S.

Possible candidates:
- DULLS – but D and L are allowed, U is correct.  
  Check: D(allowed), U(correct), L(allowed), L(allowed), S(correct).  
  But L would be in position 4 (ok) and position 3 (forbidden by CULPS). So invalid.

- MULCH – but C is eliminated.

- FULKS – K is eliminated.

- VULGS – G is eliminated.

- WULFS – F is allowed, W is allowed.  
  Check: W(allowed), U(correct), L(allowed), F(allowed), S(correct).  
  L is in position 4 (ok), S in 5 (ok). This seems valid.

Another candidate: MULDS – but D is allowed, M is allowed.  
Check: M(allowed), U(correct), L(allowed), D(allowed), S(correct).  
This also fits.

Between WULFS and MULDS, MULDS is more common.  
Let’s verify MULDS:
- M, U, L, D, S – all letters allowed by current constraints.
- U in 2, L in 4, S in 5 – all positions fit.
