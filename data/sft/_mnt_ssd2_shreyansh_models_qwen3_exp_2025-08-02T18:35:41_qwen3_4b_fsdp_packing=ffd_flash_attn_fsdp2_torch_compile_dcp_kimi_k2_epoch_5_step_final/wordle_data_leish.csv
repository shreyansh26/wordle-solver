For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

I'll choose a word that uses several of these common letters. The word ""AROSE"" is a good candidate because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

2. The letter E must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 3).
3. We must avoid A, R, O.

- E is in position 2, which is allowed since E must be in the word but not at position 5.

From the new feedback on ""lemon"":

- E is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓).
- M, O, N are not in the word (x).

So far we know:
1. The word starts with ""LE"".
2. The 4th letter is S (from arose feedback).
3. The letters A, R, O, M, N are not in the word.
4. The 5th letter must be E (from arose feedback: E is in the word but not at position 5, and now we know it's not at 2 either - but since we have E at position 2, the only remaining spot is 5, so E must be at 5).

Wait, let's re-examine the arose feedback: E(-) means E is in the word but not at position 5. From lemon feedback E(✓) at position 2, so E is at position 2. That leaves position 5 still open. But we have:
Pattern: L E _ S _

We need a letter for position 3 and 5. From the letters we've ruled out: A, R, O, M, N. Common remaining letters: T, I, D, U, C, etc.

Let's think of words that fit L E _ S _. Possible candidates:
- LEAPS (but A is ruled out)
- LEIST (but S is already at 4)
- LEDES (but D is possible)
- LEVSE (but V is less common)
- LEXES (but X is less common)
- LITES (but I is possible)

""LITES"" seems good: uses I and T which are common, and fits L E I S T.

But let's check if T is allowed - it hasn't been ruled out yet. Yes, T is a new letter.

Another candidate: ""LEDES"" - but D is possible, but we have to check if E is allowed at position 5 - but arose feedback said E is not at 5, so this is invalid.

""LITES"" seems the best: L E I S T.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- L and E are fixed in positions 1 and 2.
- S is fixed in position 4.
- E must also appear somewhere, but position 2 already has E, and position 5 cannot have E (from arose feedback), so E cannot appear elsewhere - this suggests a contradiction, meaning my earlier assumption was wrong.

Re-evaluating: arose feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. lemon feedback says E is in position 2 (✓). Therefore E must be at position 2, and cannot appear elsewhere. This means the word is L E _ S _ and we need a letter for position 3 and 5, avoiding all ruled-out letters (A, R, O, M, N).

Re-evaluating: arose feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. lemon feedback says E is in position 2 (✓). Therefore E must be at position 2, and cannot appear elsewhere. This means the word is L E _ S _ and we need a letter for position 3 and 5, avoiding all ruled-out letters (A, R, O, M, N).

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words: L E _ S _.
Possible candidates:
- LEAPS (A ruled out)
- LEIST (valid word, I and T are new)
- LEXES (X and second E - E already at 2, cannot repeat)
- LITES (I and T are new)

""LITES"" fits: L E I S T.

Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
   - S is fixed at position 4.
   - E is in the word but not at position 5.

2. lemon → L(✓) E(✓) M(x) O(x) N(x)
   - L is fixed at position 1.
   - E is fixed at position 2.
   - M, O, N are not in the word.

3. lites → L(✓) I(-) T(x) E(-) S(-)
   - L is still correct at position 1.
   - E is still correct at position 2 (so the feedback ""E(-)"" here is actually indicating E is in the word but not at position 5, which is already satisfied since E is at 2).
   - S is still correct at position 4 (so the feedback ""S(-)"" here is indicating S is in the word but not at position 4, which contradicts the earlier ""S(✓)"" - this suggests the feedback might be misinterpreted).

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback for lites:
- L(✓) at position 1: correct.
- I(-) at position 2: I is in the word but not at position 2. But position 2 is already E (✓), so this implies I cannot be at position 2, which is fine because E is there.
- T(x) at position 3: T is not in the word.
- E(-) at position 4: E is in the word but not at position 4. This is redundant since E is at position 2.
- S(-) at position 5: S is in the word but not at position 5. This contradicts the earlier ""S(✓)"" from arose, which said S is at position 4. This suggests the feedback might be indicating S is in the word but not at position 5, which is consistent because S is at position 4.

So the pattern is now:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: E
- Position 4: S
- Position 3 and 5 are unknown, but we know:
  - Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, M, N, T
  - E is already used at position 2 and cannot appear again (from arose feedback: E is in the word but not at position 5, and we have it at 2, so no other E)
  - I is in the word but not at position 2 (from lites feedback: I(-) at position 2, so I must be at position 3 or 5)

So the word must be L E I S _ or L E _ S I.

Looking at common 5-letter words:
- LEIS_ : LEIST (but T is ruled out)
- LE_ S I : LEPSI (but P is possible, but let's think of valid words)

Wait, let's list possible letters for position 3 and 5:
Position 3: I (from I(-) feedback, must be here or 5)
Position 5: must be a letter not yet ruled out and not E, A, R, O, M, N, T.

Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for words:
- L E I S _ : LEIS_ - LEIST (invalid, T ruled out)
- L E _ S I : LEPSI (valid word: lepsi is a plural of lepse, but not common)
- LEVSI (invalid)
- LEXIS (valid word: lexis is the study of words)

""LEXIS"" fits:
- L at 1, E at 2, X at 3, I at 4 (but I is supposed to be in word, and S is at 4), wait no:
Wait pattern is L E _ S I, so position 3 would be X, position 4 S, position 5 I.

""LEXIS"" is L E X I S, which would be positions:
1: L, 2: E, 3: X, 4: I, 5: S - but this contradicts S must be at 4.

I think I'm confused. Let me re-express:

Pattern:
1: L
2: E
3: ?
4: S
5: ?

From lites feedback:
- I is in the word but not at position 2 (so must be at 3 or 5)
- E is already at 2, cannot be elsewhere
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, M, N, T

So possible words:
- L E I S _ : but position 4 is S, so L E I S _ would be 5 letters: L E I S ?
But that's 4 letters, so the word must be L E _ S I or L E I S ? but position 4 is S.

Wait, positions are 1-5:
1: L
2: E
3: ?
4: S
5: ?

And I must be in the word, so either position 3 or 5.

Possible words:
- L E I S ? : but position 4 is S, so position 3 is I, position 5 must be a new letter. But we have L E I S _ - but that's 4 letters. The word must be L E _ S I or L E I S _ but position 4 is S, so L E I S _ would be L E I S ?, which is 4 letters.

I think the word must be L E I S ? but that's 4 letters. Wait, no:

The word is 5 letters: positions 1-5:
1: L
2: E
3: ?
4: S
5: ?

And I must be in the word, so either position 3 or 5.

Possible words:
- L E I S ? : but position 5 must be a new letter. But we have:
  - L E I S _ : but that's 4 letters, so the word must be L E I S ? which is 5 letters: L E I S ?

But we have:
1: L
2: E
3: I
4: S
5: ?

So the word is L E I S ?

Looking for common letters for position 5, not ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- LEISB (invalid)
- LEISD (invalid)
- LEISF (invalid)
- LEISG (invalid)
- LEISH (valid word: leish is a variant spelling of leishman)
- LEISK (invalid)
- LEISP (invalid)
- LEISY (invalid)

""LEISH"" seems the only valid word, but it's a variant. Alternatively, maybe I is at position 5:

Word pattern: L E _ S I

Looking for common letters at position 3:
- L E _ S I
Possible letters for position 3: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- LEBSI (invalid)
- LEC SI (invalid)
- LED SI (invalid)
- LEFSI (invalid)
- LEG SI (invalid)
- LEHSI (invalid)
- LEJ SI (invalid)
- LEEKI (invalid)
- LEP SI (invalid)
- LEQ SI (invalid)
- LEUSI (invalid)
- LEV SI (invalid)
- LEWSI (invalid)
- LEX SI (invalid)
- LEYSI (invalid)

This seems limited. Maybe the word is ""LEPSI"" (plural of lepse, but not common). Alternatively, perhaps the word is ""LEVIS"" (but V is possible).

But ""LEVIS"" is a valid word (brand name), but let's see if it fits:
- L E V I S: positions 1: L, 2: E, 3: V, 4: I, 5: S - but this contradicts S must be at 4.

This suggests I might have misinterpreted the feedback. Let me re-examine:

From arose: S is at 4 (✓), E is in word but not at 5 (-).
From lemon: L at 1 (✓), E at 2 (✓), M, O, N not in word (x).
From lites: L at 1 (✓), I at 2 (-), T not in word (x), E at 4 (-), S at 5 (-).

The feedback for lites:
- L(✓) at 1: correct
- I(-) at 2: I is in word but not at 2
- T(x) at 3: T not in word
- E(-) at 4: E is in word but not at 4 (but E is at 2, so this is redundant)
- S(-) at 5: S is in word but not at 5 (but S is at 4, so this is consistent)

So the word pattern is:
1: L
2: E
3: ?
4: S
5: ?

And I must be in the word but not at position 2, so I must be at 3 or 5.

Possible words:
- L E I S ? : but position 5 must be a new letter, and we have:
  - L E I S _ : but this is 4 letters, so the word must be L E I S ? which is 5 letters: L E I S ?

But this seems impossible because position 4 is S, so the word would be L E I S ?, which is 5 letters: L E I S ?

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- L E I S _ : LEIST (invalid, T ruled out)
- L E _ S I : LEPSI (valid word: lepsi is plural of lepse, but not common)
- L E _ S I : LEVSI (invalid)
- L E _ S I : LEXIS (invalid, X at 3, but S is at 4)

This is tricky. Maybe the word is ""LEPSI"" (plural of lepse), but it's obscure. Alternatively, ""LEVIS"" (brand name), but S must be at 4.

Given the constraints, the most plausible word seems to be ""LEPSI"", but let me check if there's a better fit.

Another approach: since I must be in the word, and positions 3 or 5, and letters ruled out are A, R, O, M, N, T.

Possible words:
- L E I S ? : LEIST (invalid)
- L E _ S I : LEPSI (possible), LEXIS (invalid), LEVSI (invalid)

""LEPSI"" is the only valid word that fits, so I'll guess it.

But wait, ""LEPSI"" is L E P S I, which would be:
1: L, 2: E, 3: P, 4: S, 5: I - this fits all constraints:
- L at 1 (✓)
- E at 2 (✓)
- S at 4 (✓)
- I at 5 (must be in word, and not at 2)
- P is a new letter, not ruled out

This seems correct.

</think>

Based on the accumulated feedback, the pattern is now:
- L E _ S _
- I must appear in the word (from lites feedback I(-) at position 2), so it must be at position 3 or 5.
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, M, N, T.
- Position 3 and 5 must be filled with letters not yet used.

The most plausible word fitting these constraints is ""LEPSI"" (plural of lepse), which places I at position 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

I'll choose a word that uses several of these common letters. The word ""AROSE"" is a good candidate because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- S is in the word and in the correct 4th position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ _ _ S _ (with S fixed at position 4).
2. The letter E must appear somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 3).
3. We must avoid A, R, O.

Next, I want a word that:
- Keeps S in position 4.
- Places E in one of the remaining positions (1, 2, or 3).
- Uses new common letters to gather more information.

A good candidate is ""LEMON"":
- L, M, N are common letters we haven't tested yet.
- E is in position 2, which is allowed since E must be in the word but not at position 5.
- S is already fixed at position 4.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
Guess 2: lemon -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) E(✓) M(x) O(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""lemon"":
- L is in the word and in the correct 1st position (✓).
- E is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓).
- M, O, N are not in the word (x).

So far we know:
1. The word starts with ""LE"".
2. The 4th letter is S (from arose feedback).
3. The letters A, R, O, M, N are not in the word.
4. The 5th letter must be E (from arose feedback: E is in the word but not at position 5, and now we know it's not at 2 either - but since we have E at position 2, the only remaining spot is 5, so E must be at 5).

Wait, let's re-examine the arose feedback: E(-) means E is in the word but not at position 5. From lemon feedback E(✓) at position 2, so E is at position 2. That leaves position 5 still open. But we have:
Pattern: L E _ S _

We need a letter for position 3 and 5. From the letters we've ruled out: A, R, O, M, N. Common remaining letters: T, I, D, U, C, etc.

Let's think of words that fit L E _ S _. Possible candidates:
- LEAPS (but A is ruled out)
- LEIST (but S is already at 4)
- LEDES (but D is possible)
- LEVSE (but V is less common)
- LEXES (but X is less common)
- LITES (but I is possible)

""LITES"" seems good: uses I and T which are common, and fits L E I S T.

But let's check if T is allowed - it hasn't been ruled out yet. Yes, T is a new letter.

Another candidate: ""LEDES"" - but D is possible, but we have to check if E is allowed at position 5 - but arose feedback said E is not at 5, so this is invalid.

""LITES"" seems the best: L E I S T.Based on the feedback:
- L and E are fixed in positions 1 and 2.
- S is fixed in position 4.
- E must also appear somewhere, but position 2 already has E, and position 5 cannot have E (from arose feedback), so E cannot appear elsewhere - this suggests a contradiction, meaning my earlier assumption was wrong.

Re-evaluating: arose feedback says E is in the word but not at position 5. lemon feedback says E is in position 2 (✓). Therefore E must be at position 2, and cannot appear elsewhere. This means the word is L E _ S _ and we need a letter for position 3 and 5, avoiding all ruled-out letters (A, R, O, M, N).

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words: L E _ S _.
Possible candidates:
- LEAPS (A ruled out)
- LEIST (valid word, I and T are new)
- LEXES (X and second E - E already at 2, cannot repeat)
- LITES (I and T are new)

""LITES"" fits: L E I S T.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
Guess 2: lemon -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) E(✓) M(x) O(x) N(x)
Guess 3: lites -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) I(-) T(x) E(-) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
   - S is fixed at position 4.
   - E is in the word but not at position 5.

2. lemon → L(✓) E(✓) M(x) O(x) N(x)
   - L is fixed at position 1.
   - E is fixed at position 2.
   - M, O, N are not in the word.

3. lites → L(✓) I(-) T(x) E(-) S(-)
   - L is still correct at position 1.
   - E is still correct at position 2 (so the feedback ""E(-)"" here is actually indicating E is in the word but not at position 5, which is already satisfied since E is at 2).
   - S is still correct at position 4 (so the feedback ""S(-)"" here is indicating S is in the word but not at position 4, which contradicts the earlier ""S(✓)"" - this suggests the feedback might be misinterpreted).

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback for lites:
- L(✓) at position 1: correct.
- I(-) at position 2: I is in the word but not at position 2. But position 2 is already E (✓), so this implies I cannot be at position 2, which is fine because E is there.
- T(x) at position 3: T is not in the word.
- E(-) at position 4: E is in the word but not at position 4. This is redundant since E is at position 2.
- S(-) at position 5: S is in the word but not at position 5. This contradicts the earlier ""S(✓)"" from arose, which said S is at position 4. This suggests the feedback might be indicating S is in the word but not at position 5, which is consistent because S is at position 4.

So the pattern is now:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: E
- Position 4: S
- Position 3 and 5 are unknown, but we know:
  - Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, M, N, T
  - E is already used at position 2 and cannot appear again (from arose feedback: E is in the word but not at position 5, and we have it at 2, so no other E)
  - I is in the word but not at position 2 (from lites feedback: I(-) at position 2, so I must be at position 3 or 5)

So the word must be L E I S _ or L E _ S I.

Looking at common 5-letter words:
- LEIS_ : LEIST (but T is ruled out)
- LE_ S I : LEPSI (but P is possible, but let's think of valid words)

Wait, let's list possible letters for position 3 and 5:
Position 3: I (from I(-) feedback, must be here or 5)
Position 5: must be a letter not yet ruled out and not E, A, R, O, M, N, T.

Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for words:
- L E I S _ : LEIS_ - LEIST (invalid, T ruled out)
- L E _ S I : LEPSI (valid word: lepsi is a plural of lepse, but not common)
- LEVSI (invalid)
- LEXIS (valid word: lexis is the study of words)

""LEXIS"" fits:
- L at 1, E at 2, X at 3, I at 4 (but I is supposed to be in word, and S is at 4), wait no:
Wait pattern is L E _ S I, so position 3 would be X, position 4 S, position 5 I.

""LEXIS"" is L E X I S, which would be positions:
1: L, 2: E, 3: X, 4: I, 5: S - but this contradicts S must be at 4.

I think I'm confused. Let me re-express:

Pattern:
1: L
2: E
3: ?
4: S
5: ?

From lites feedback:
- I is in the word but not at position 2 (so must be at 3 or 5)
- E is already at 2, cannot be elsewhere
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, M, N, T

So possible words:
- L E I S _ : but position 4 is S, so L E I S _ would be 5 letters: L E I S ?
But that's 4 letters, so the word must be L E _ S I or L E I S ? but position 4 is S.

Wait, positions are 1-5:
1: L
2: E
3: ?
4: S
5: ?

And I must be in the word, so either position 3 or 5.

Possible words:
- L E I S ? : but position 4 is S, so position 3 is I, position 5 must be a new letter. But we have L E I S _ - but that's 4 letters. The word must be L E _ S I or L E I S _ but position 4 is S, so L E I S _ would be L E I S ?, which is 4 letters.

I think the word must be L E I S ? but that's 4 letters. Wait, no:

The word is 5 letters: positions 1-5:
1: L
2: E
3: ?
4: S
5: ?

And I must be in the word, so either position 3 or 5.

Possible words:
- L E I S ? : but position 5 must be a new letter. But we have:
  - L E I S _ : but that's 4 letters, so the word must be L E I S ? which is 5 letters: L E I S ?

But we have:
1: L
2: E
3: I
4: S
5: ?

So the word is L E I S ?

Looking for common letters for position 5, not ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- LEISB (invalid)
- LEISD (invalid)
- LEISF (invalid)
- LEISG (invalid)
- LEISH (valid word: leish is a variant spelling of leishman)
- LEISK (invalid)
- LEISP (invalid)
- LEISY (invalid)

""LEISH"" seems the only valid word, but it's a variant. Alternatively, maybe I is at position 5:

Word pattern: L E _ S I

Looking for common letters at position 3:
- L E _ S I
Possible letters for position 3: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- LEBSI (invalid)
- LEC SI (invalid)
- LED SI (invalid)
- LEFSI (invalid)
- LEG SI (invalid)
- LEHSI (invalid)
- LEJ SI (invalid)
- LEEKI (invalid)
- LEP SI (invalid)
- LEQ SI (invalid)
- LEUSI (invalid)
- LEV SI (invalid)
- LEWSI (invalid)
- LEX SI (invalid)
- LEYSI (invalid)

This seems limited. Maybe the word is ""LEPSI"" (plural of lepse, but not common). Alternatively, perhaps the word is ""LEVIS"" (but V is possible).

But ""LEVIS"" is a valid word (brand name), but let's see if it fits:
- L E V I S: positions 1: L, 2: E, 3: V, 4: I, 5: S - but this contradicts S must be at 4.

This suggests I might have misinterpreted the feedback. Let me re-examine:

From arose: S is at 4 (✓), E is in word but not at 5 (-).
From lemon: L at 1 (✓), E at 2 (✓), M, O, N not in word (x).
From lites: L at 1 (✓), I at 2 (-), T not in word (x), E at 4 (-), S at 5 (-).

The feedback for lites:
- L(✓) at 1: correct
- I(-) at 2: I is in word but not at 2
- T(x) at 3: T not in word
- E(-) at 4: E is in word but not at 4 (but E is at 2, so this is redundant)
- S(-) at 5: S is in word but not at 5 (but S is at 4, so this is consistent)

So the word pattern is:
1: L
2: E
3: ?
4: S
5: ?

And I must be in the word but not at position 2, so I must be at 3 or 5.

Possible words:
- L E I S ? : but position 5 must be a new letter, and we have:
  - L E I S _ : but this is 4 letters, so the word must be L E I S ? which is 5 letters: L E I S ?

But this seems impossible because position 4 is S, so the word would be L E I S ?, which is 5 letters: L E I S ?

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- L E I S _ : LEIST (invalid, T ruled out)
- L E _ S I : LEPSI (valid word: lepsi is plural of lepse, but not common)
- L E _ S I : LEVSI (invalid)
- L E _ S I : LEXIS (invalid, X at 3, but S is at 4)

This is tricky. Maybe the word is ""LEPSI"" (plural of lepse), but it's obscure. Alternatively, ""LEVIS"" (brand name), but S must be at 4.

Given the constraints, the most plausible word seems to be ""LEPSI"", but let me check if there's a better fit.

Another approach: since I must be in the word, and positions 3 or 5, and letters ruled out are A, R, O, M, N, T.

Possible words:
- L E I S ? : LEIST (invalid)
- L E _ S I : LEPSI (possible), LEXIS (invalid), LEVSI (invalid)

""LEPSI"" is the only valid word that fits, so I'll guess it.

But wait, ""LEPSI"" is L E P S I, which would be:
1: L, 2: E, 3: P, 4: S, 5: I - this fits all constraints:
- L at 1 (✓)
- E at 2 (✓)
- S at 4 (✓)
- I at 5 (must be in word, and not at 2)
- P is a new letter, not ruled out

This seems correct.Based on the accumulated feedback, the pattern is now:
- L E _ S _
- I must appear in the word (from lites feedback I(-) at position 2), so it must be at position 3 or 5.
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, M, N, T.
- Position 3 and 5 must be filled with letters not yet used.

The most plausible word fitting these constraints is ""LEPSI"" (plural of lepse), which places I at position 5.

Maybe the word is ""LEPSI"" (plural of lepse, but not common). Alternatively, perhaps the word is ""LEVIS"" (but V is possible).\n\nBut ""LEVIS"" is a valid word (brand name), but let\'s see if it fits:\n- L E V I S: positions 1: L, 2: E, 3: V, 4: I, 5: S - but this contradicts S must be at 4.\n\nThis suggests I might have misinterpreted the feedback.

Maybe the word is ""LEPSI"" (plural of lepse), but it\'s obscure. Alternatively, ""LEVIS"" (brand name), but S must be at 4.\n\nGiven the constraints, the most plausible word seems to be ""LEPSI"", but let me check if there\'s a better fit.\n\nAnother approach: since I must be in the word, and positions 3 or 5, and letters ruled out are A, R, O, M, N, T.\n\nPossible words:\n- L E I S ? : LEIST (invalid)\n- L E _ S I : LEPSI (possible), LEXIS (invalid), LEVSI (invalid)\n\n""LEPSI"" is the only valid word that fits, so I\'ll guess it.\n\nBut wait, ""LEPSI"" is L E P S I, which would be:\n1: L, 2: E, 3: P, 4: S, 5: I - this fits all constraints:\n- L at 1 (✓)\n- E at 2 (✓)\n- S at 4 (✓)\n- I at 5 (must be in word, and not at 2)\n- P is a new letter, not ruled out\n\nThis seems correct.Based on the accumulated feedback, the pattern is now:\n- L E _ S _\n- I must appear in the word (from lites feedback I(-) at position 2), so it must be at position 3 or 5.\n- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, M, N, T.\n- Position 3 and 5 must be filled with letters not yet used.\n\nThe most plausible word fitting these constraints is ""LEPSI"" (plural of lepse), which places I at position 5.\n\n<guess>lepsi</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)\nGuess 2: lemon -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) E(✓) M(x) O(x) N(x)\nGuess 3: lites -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) I(-) T(x) E(-) S(-)\nGuess 4: lepsi -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) E(✓) P(x) S(✓) I(-)\n'}]","<think>
Let's consolidate everything we now know after four guesses.

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
   - S is fixed in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not at position 5.

2. lemon → L(✓) E(✓) M(x) O(x) N(x)
   - L is fixed in position 1.
   - E is fixed in position 2.
   - M, O, N are not in the word.

3. lites → L(✓) I(-) T(x) E(-) S(-)
   - I is in the word but not at position 2 (and we already have E at 2, so I must be elsewhere).
   - T is not in the word.

4. lepsi → L(✓) E(✓) P(x) S(✓) I(-)
   - P is not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not at position 5.

So the word pattern is:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: E
- Position 4: S
- I must appear in the word and must be at position 3 (since positions 2 and 5 are excluded for I).

Thus the word must be L E I S _ (with the last letter being any letter not yet ruled out and not already used).

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, M, N, T, P.

Remaining common letters for position 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit L E I S _ :
- LEIST (invalid, T ruled out)
- LEICS (valid, plural of leek)
- LEIDS (invalid)
- LEIFS (invalid)
- LEIGS (invalid)
- LEISH (valid, plural of leish)
- LEISK (invalid)
- LEIVS (invalid)
- LEIXS (invalid)
- LEIZS (invalid)

The most plausible valid words are ""LEICS"" (plural of leek) and ""LEISH"". Between these, ""LEISH"" is more common in word lists, so I'll guess LEISH.
