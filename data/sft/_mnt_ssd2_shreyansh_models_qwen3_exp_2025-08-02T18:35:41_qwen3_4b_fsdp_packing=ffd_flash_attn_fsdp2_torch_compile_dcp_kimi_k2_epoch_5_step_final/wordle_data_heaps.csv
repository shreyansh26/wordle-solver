For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so not 5th letter).

- It contains S, E, and A (with A fixed at position 3).
- It does NOT contain L or T.

We need a new 5-letter word that:

2. Contains S and E somewhere else (not 1st and 5th respectively).

4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""CREAS"":
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- E (known to be in word, now in 2nd position)
- A (fixed in 3rd)
- S (known to be in word, now in 5th)

This tests new letters (C, R) and repositions E and S to see if we can pin down their correct spots.

Let’s update what we know after the two guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word and is in position 3.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (CREAS):
- C is not in the word.
- R is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 4 (which is already known to be position 3, so this is consistent).
- S is in the word and is in position 5.

So the word has the pattern:
- 1st letter: unknown, but not S, L, T, C, R.
- 2nd letter: unknown, but not E.
- 3rd letter: A (fixed).
- 4th letter: unknown, but not A.
- 5th letter: S (fixed).

Letters we know are in the word: S, E, A.
Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, T, C, R.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3 and S in position 5.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Does not contain L, T, C, R.

Possible candidates:
- EASED: but we already have S in position 5, so this would have E in 1st, A in 3rd, S in 5th, but we need a 5-letter word. However, EASED has D which we haven’t tested yet. But we need to check if EASED fits: E A S E D – no, A is 3rd, S is 5th, but E is in 1st and 4th, which might be possible. However, we don’t know about D yet.
- EAGLE: contains L which is invalid.
- PEACH: no S or A in correct positions.
- HEAPS: has H, E, A, P, S – A is 3rd, S is 5th, E is 2nd. But E is in position 2 which we know is wrong (from CREAS feedback E was wrong in position 2). So HEAPS is invalid.
- PASEO: has P, A, S, E, O – A is 3rd, S is 5th, E is 4th. This fits all constraints: no L, T, C, R, A in 3rd, S in 5th, E in 4th (which is new position). PASEO is a valid word.

Another candidate: PEASE – but E is in position 2 which we know is wrong.
MASSY – has S twice, but we don’t know about Y yet, and A is 3rd, S is 5th. But we need E somewhere. So MASSY is invalid.
PEASE – invalid for same reason.

PASEO seems to fit all constraints:
- A in 3rd, S in 5th.

- Has A in position 3 and S in position 5.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Does not contain L, T, C, R.

Possible candidates:
- EASED: but we already have S in position 5, so this would have E in 1st, A in 3rd, S in 5th, but we need a 5-letter word. However, EASED has D which we haven’t tested yet. But we need to check if EASED fits: E A S E D – no, A is 3rd, S is 5th, but E is in 1st and 4th, which might be possible. However, we don’t know about D yet.
- EAGLE: contains L which is invalid.
- PEACH: no S or A in correct positions.
- HEAPS: has H, E, A, P, S – A is 3rd, S is 5th, E is 2nd. But E is in position 2 which we know is wrong (from CREAS feedback E was wrong in position 2). So HEAPS is invalid.
- PASEO: has P, A, S, E, O – A is 3rd, S is 5th, E is 4th. This fits all constraints: no L, T, C, R, A in 3rd, S in 5th, E in 4th (which is new position). PASEO is a valid word.

Another candidate: PEASE – but E is in position 2 which we know is wrong.
MASSY – has S twice, but we don’t know about Y yet, and A is 3rd, S is 5th. But we need E somewhere. So MASSY is invalid.
PEASE – invalid for same reason.

PASEO seems to fit all constraints:
- A in 3rd, S in 5th.
- E in 4th (new position).
- No L, T, C, R.
- Uses new letters P and O to gather more information.

Let’s go with PASEO.

Let’s carefully update what we now know after the three guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word and is in position 3.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (CREAS):
- C is not in the word.
- R is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 4 (consistent with A already fixed at position 3).
- S is in the word and is in position 5.

From Guess 3 (PASEO):
- P is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent with A fixed at 3).
- S is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent with S fixed at 5).
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (so E must be in position 1, since it can’t be 2 or 5).
- O is not in the word.

So the pattern is now:
- Position 1: E (only remaining place for E)
- Position 2: unknown, but not A, C, L, R, S, T, O
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: unknown, but not S (fixed at 5), not A, not E (fixed at 1), not L, T, C, R, O
- Position 5: S (fixed)

Letters we know are in the word: E, A, S
Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, T, C, R, O

We need a 5-letter word with:
E _ A _ S
and letters in positions 2 and 4 must be from remaining unused common letters (not in the forbidden list).

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

From Guess 3 we saw that P is in the word but not in position 1 (so P could be in position 2 or 4).  
Let’s test P in position 2: E P A _ S  
We need a letter for position 4 that is not forbidden. Common choices: D, G, H, I, K, M, N, etc.

EPADS – D is allowed, but we don’t know about D yet.  
EPAHS – H is allowed.  
EPAKS – K is allowed.  
EPAIS – I is allowed.  
EPAGS – G is allowed.  
EPANS – N is allowed.  

Among these, ""EPANS"" is not a valid word.  
""EPADS"" is not valid.  
""EPAGS"" is not valid.  
""EPANS"" is not valid.  
""EPAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try ""EPAIS"" – not valid.  
""EPAHS"" – not valid.  

Another approach: position 4 could be N, making ""EPA NS"" – but we need a valid word.  
""EPANS"" is invalid.  

Let’s try position 4 = N: ""E P A N S"" – that’s ""EPANS"" which is invalid.  

Let’s try position 2 = N: ""E N A _ S"" – we need a letter for position 4.  
""ENASE"" – invalid.  
""ENABS"" – invalid.  

Let’s try position 2 = I: ""E I A _ S"" – ""EIA S"" – ""EIAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = D: ""E D A _ S"" – ""EDAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = G: ""E G A _ S"" – ""EGAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = H: ""E H A _ S"" – ""EHAS"" is 4 letters.

Let’s try position 2 = X: ""E X A _ S"" – ""EXAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = Y: ""E Y A _ S"" – ""EYAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = Z: ""E Z A _ S"" – ""EZAS"" is 4 letters.  

None of these seem to form valid English words.  

Let’s reconsider: perhaps position 2 is not P, but another letter.  

We know P is in the word but not in position 1 (from Guess 3 feedback), so P must be in position 2 or 4.  

Let’s try P in position 4: E _ A P S  
We need a letter for position 2 that is not forbidden.  

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

None of these are valid words.  

Let’s try position 2 = N and position 4 = D: E N A D S – ""ENADS"" is not valid.  
Position 2 = N and position 4 = G: E N A G S – ""ENAGS"" is not valid.

Let’s try position 2 = V and position 4 = N: E V A N S – ""EVANS"" is a valid word!  

""EVANS"" fits all constraints:
- E in position 1 (required)
- V in position 2 (not forbidden)
- A in position 3 (fixed)
- N in position 4 (not forbidden)
- S in position 5 (fixed)
- Uses V and N, which are new letters
- No forbidden letters (L, T, C, R, O)

Based on the updated constraints, the only valid word that fits is ""EVANS"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so not 1st letter).
- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so not 5th letter).

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
- It contains S, E, and A (with A fixed at position 3).
- It does NOT contain L or T.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in the 3rd position.
2. Contains S and E somewhere else (not 1st and 5th respectively).
3. Does not contain L or T.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""CREAS"":
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- E (known to be in word, now in 2nd position)
- A (fixed in 3rd)
- S (known to be in word, now in 5th)

This tests new letters (C, R) and repositions E and S to see if we can pin down their correct spots.

Let’s update what we know after the two guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word and is in position 3.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (CREAS):
- C is not in the word.
- R is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 4 (which is already known to be position 3, so this is consistent).
- S is in the word and is in position 5.

So the word has the pattern:
- 1st letter: unknown, but not S, L, T, C, R.
- 2nd letter: unknown, but not E.
- 3rd letter: A (fixed).
- 4th letter: unknown, but not A.
- 5th letter: S (fixed).

Letters we know are in the word: S, E, A.
Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, T, C, R.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3 and S in position 5.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Does not contain L, T, C, R.

Possible candidates:
- EASED: but we already have S in position 5, so this would have E in 1st, A in 3rd, S in 5th, but we need a 5-letter word. However, EASED has D which we haven’t tested yet. But we need to check if EASED fits: E A S E D – no, A is 3rd, S is 5th, but E is in 1st and 4th, which might be possible. However, we don’t know about D yet.
- EAGLE: contains L which is invalid.
- PEACH: no S or A in correct positions.
- HEAPS: has H, E, A, P, S – A is 3rd, S is 5th, E is 2nd. But E is in position 2 which we know is wrong (from CREAS feedback E was wrong in position 2). So HEAPS is invalid.
- PASEO: has P, A, S, E, O – A is 3rd, S is 5th, E is 4th. This fits all constraints: no L, T, C, R, A in 3rd, S in 5th, E in 4th (which is new position). PASEO is a valid word.

Another candidate: PEASE – but E is in position 2 which we know is wrong.
MASSY – has S twice, but we don’t know about Y yet, and A is 3rd, S is 5th. But we need E somewhere. So MASSY is invalid.
PEASE – invalid for same reason.

PASEO seems to fit all constraints:
- A in 3rd, S in 5th.
- E in 4th (new position).
- No L, T, C, R.
- Uses new letters P and O to gather more information.

Let’s go with PASEO.

Let’s carefully update what we now know after the three guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word and is in position 3.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (CREAS):
- C is not in the word.
- R is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 4 (consistent with A already fixed at position 3).
- S is in the word and is in position 5.

From Guess 3 (PASEO):
- P is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (consistent with A fixed at 3).
- S is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent with S fixed at 5).
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (so E must be in position 1, since it can’t be 2 or 5).
- O is not in the word.

So the pattern is now:
- Position 1: E (only remaining place for E)
- Position 2: unknown, but not A, C, L, R, S, T, O
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: unknown, but not S (fixed at 5), not A, not E (fixed at 1), not L, T, C, R, O
- Position 5: S (fixed)

Letters we know are in the word: E, A, S
Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, T, C, R, O

We need a 5-letter word with:
E _ A _ S
and letters in positions 2 and 4 must be from remaining unused common letters (not in the forbidden list).

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

From Guess 3 we saw that P is in the word but not in position 1 (so P could be in position 2 or 4).  
Let’s test P in position 2: E P A _ S  
We need a letter for position 4 that is not forbidden. Common choices: D, G, H, I, K, M, N, etc.

EPADS – D is allowed, but we don’t know about D yet.  
EPAHS – H is allowed.  
EPAKS – K is allowed.  
EPAIS – I is allowed.  
EPAGS – G is allowed.  
EPANS – N is allowed.  

Among these, ""EPANS"" is not a valid word.  
""EPADS"" is not valid.  
""EPAGS"" is not valid.  
""EPANS"" is not valid.  
""EPAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try ""EPAIS"" – not valid.  
""EPAHS"" – not valid.  

Another approach: position 4 could be N, making ""EPA NS"" – but we need a valid word.  
""EPANS"" is invalid.  

Let’s try position 4 = N: ""E P A N S"" – that’s ""EPANS"" which is invalid.  

Let’s try position 2 = N: ""E N A _ S"" – we need a letter for position 4.  
""ENASE"" – invalid.  
""ENABS"" – invalid.  

Let’s try position 2 = I: ""E I A _ S"" – ""EIA S"" – ""EIAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = D: ""E D A _ S"" – ""EDAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = G: ""E G A _ S"" – ""EGAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = H: ""E H A _ S"" – ""EHAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = K: ""E K A _ S"" – ""EKAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = M: ""E M A _ S"" – ""EMAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = B: ""E B A _ S"" – ""EBAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = F: ""E F A _ S"" – ""EFAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = J: ""E J A _ S"" – ""EJAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = Q: ""E Q A _ S"" – ""EQAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = U: ""E U A _ S"" – ""EUAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = V: ""E V A _ S"" – ""EVAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = W: ""E W A _ S"" – ""EWAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = X: ""E X A _ S"" – ""EXAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = Y: ""E Y A _ S"" – ""EYAS"" is 4 letters.  

Let’s try position 2 = Z: ""E Z A _ S"" – ""EZAS"" is 4 letters.  

None of these seem to form valid English words.  

Let’s reconsider: perhaps position 2 is not P, but another letter.  

We know P is in the word but not in position 1 (from Guess 3 feedback), so P must be in position 2 or 4.  

Let’s try P in position 4: E _ A P S  
We need a letter for position 2 that is not forbidden.  

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Let’s try B: E B A P S – ""EBAPS"" is not valid.  
D: E D A P S – ""EDAPS"" is not valid.  
F: E F A P S – ""EFAPS"" is not valid.  
G: E G A P S – ""EGAPS"" is not valid.  
H: E H A P S – ""EHAPS"" is not valid.  
I: E I A P S – ""EIAPS"" is not valid.  
K: E K A P S – ""EKAPS"" is not valid.  
M: E M A P S – ""EMAPS"" is not valid.  
N: E N A P S – ""ENAPS"" is not valid.  
Q: E Q A P S – ""EQAPS"" is not valid.  
U: E U A P S – ""EUAPS"" is not valid.  
V: E V A P S – ""EVAPS"" is not valid.  
W: E W A P S – ""EWAPS"" is not valid.  
X: E X A P S – ""EXAPS"" is not valid.  
Y: E Y A P S – ""EYAPS"" is not valid.  
Z: E Z A P S – ""EZAPS"" is not valid.  

None of these are valid words.  

Let’s try position 2 = N and position 4 = D: E N A D S – ""ENADS"" is not valid.  
Position 2 = N and position 4 = G: E N A G S – ""ENAGS"" is not valid.  
Position 2 = N and position 4 = H: E N A H S – ""ENAH S"" – ""ENAH S"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = I and position 4 = N: E I A N S – ""EIANS"" is not valid.  
Position 2 = I and position 4 = D: E I A D S – ""EIADS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = D and position 4 = N: E D A N S – ""EDANS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = M and position 4 = N: E M A N S – ""EMANS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = M and position 4 = D: E M A D S – ""EMADS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = H and position 4 = N: E H A N S – ""EHANS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = H and position 4 = D: E H A D S – ""EHADS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = G and position 4 = N: E G A N S – ""EGANS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = G and position 4 = D: E G A D S – ""EGADS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = B and position 4 = N: E B A N S – ""EBANS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = B and position 4 = D: E B A D S – ""EBADS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = F and position 4 = N: E F A N S – ""EFANS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = F and position 4 = D: E F A D S – ""EFADS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = K and position 4 = N: E K A N S – ""EKANS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = K and position 4 = D: E K A D S – ""EKADS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = J and position 4 = N: E J A N S – ""EJANS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = J and position 4 = D: E J A D S – ""EJADS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = Q and position 4 = N: E Q A N S – ""EQANS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = Q and position 4 = D: E Q A D S – ""EQADS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = U and position 4 = N: E U A N S – ""EUANS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = U and position 4 = D: E U A D S – ""EUADS"" is not valid.  

Let’s try position 2 = V and position 4 = N: E V A N S – ""EVANS"" is a valid word!  

""EVANS"" fits all constraints:
- E in position 1 (required)
- V in position 2 (not forbidden)
- A in position 3 (fixed)
- N in position 4 (not forbidden)
- S in position 5 (fixed)
- Uses V and N, which are new letters
- No forbidden letters (L, T, C, R, O)Based on the updated constraints, the only valid word that fits is ""EVANS"".

From Guess 4 (EVANS):
- E is in the word but not in position 1 (so E must be in position 2 or 4, but position 4 is already excluded by earlier feedback).
- V is not in the word.
- A is in the word and in position 3 (already known).
- N is not in the word.
- S is in the word and in position 5 (already known).

So the pattern is:
- Position 1: not E, not S, not L, not T, not C, not R, not O, not V, not N
- Position 2: must be E (since E cannot be in 1, 2, 4, or 5 from all feedback)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: must be a new letter not yet used and not forbidden
- Position 5: S (fixed)

Forbidden letters so far: L, T, C, R, O, V, N
Known letters in word: E, A, S

So the word must be: _ E A _ S

Possible letters for positions 1 and 4 (from remaining alphabet excluding forbidden ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

From Guess 3 (PASEO), P is in the word but not in position 1, so P must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be: _ E A P S

The only common English word fitting this pattern is ""HEAPS"".

Check constraints:
- H is allowed (not in forbidden list)
- E in position 2 (allowed, since E can't be in 1,4,5 but can be in 2)
- A in position 3 (correct)
- P in position 4 (allowed, since P must be in word and not in 1)
- S in position 5 (correct)
- No forbidden letters

Therefore, the next guess is ""HEAPS"".
