### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is fixed in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SHORN → S(✓) H(x) O(-) R(x) N(x)
   - S is still in position 1 (confirmed).
   - H, R, N are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Letters in the word: S (pos 1), L (somewhere else), O (somewhere else).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, T, E, H, R, N.

Remaining common letters to test: D, I, C, U, M, P, B, G, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains both L and O.
- Does NOT contain A, T, E, H, R, N.

Possible candidates:
- SLOTH – but H is excluded.
- SLOBS – but B and S are okay, but we already have S in position 1.
- SLOTH – H excluded.
- SLOBS – B is okay, but we need to check if SLOBS contains any excluded letters. S, L, O, B, S – B is allowed.
- SLOBS seems valid.

Another candidate: SLOID – but D is okay, but I is okay, but O is in position 3 which is excluded.

Better to place O in position 2 or 4 or 5, and L in position 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try SLOBS:
- S (pos 1 ✓)
- L (pos 2 – but L was excluded from pos 2 in SLATE, but can be in pos 2 again since exclusion was only positional, not absolute. Wait, no – the feedback said L is in the word but not in position 2. So L cannot be in position 2. So SLOBS would have L in position 2 – that’s invalid.

Next option: SLOID – O in position 2, L in position 3.
- S (pos 1 ✓)
- L (pos 3 – allowed)
- O (pos 2 – allowed)
- I, D are new letters not excluded.

This seems valid.

Another option: SLOID.

But let’s check if SLOID is a valid word – yes, it’s a valid word meaning a type of small stone.

But maybe simpler: SLOID.

However, let’s think of more common words. How about SLOTH – but H is excluded.

SLOBS is invalid because L would be in position 2.

SLOID seems the best next guess.

But let’s think of another: SLOID.

Alternatively, SLOID.

Another candidate: SLOID.

But let’s think of a word with L in position 3 or 4.

Another option: SLOID.

Actually, let’s try SLOID.

But to make it simpler, let’s try SLOID.

But let me think of a more common word: SLOID.

Actually, let’s try SLOID.

But perhaps a better word is SLOID.

Wait, let’s think differently: we have S _ _ _ _, and need to place L and O somewhere, with new letters.

Wait, S O L I D is 5 letters starting with S.

But S(1), O(2), L(3), I(4), D(5).

Check exclusions:
- S is allowed.
- O is allowed (in word, just not in position 3).
- L is allowed (not in position 2).
- I, D are new letters not excluded.

This seems valid.

So the word would be SOLID.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

- Letters in the word: S (pos 1), L (somewhere else), O (somewhere else).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, T, E, H, R, N.

Remaining common letters to test: D, I, C, U, M, P, B, G, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains both L and O.
- Does NOT contain A, T, E, H, R, N.

Possible candidates:
- SLOTH – but H is excluded.
- SLOBS – but B and S are okay, but we already have S in position 1.
- SLOTH – H excluded.
- SLOBS – B is okay, but we need to check if SLOBS contains any excluded letters. S, L, O, B, S – B is allowed.
- SLOBS seems valid.

Another candidate: SLOID – but D is okay, but I is okay, but O is in position 3 which is excluded.

Better to place O in position 2 or 4 or 5, and L in position 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try SLOBS:
- S (pos 1 ✓)
- L (pos 2 – but L was excluded from pos 2 in SLATE, but can be in pos 2 again since exclusion was only positional, not absolute. Wait, no – the feedback said L is in the word but not in position 2. So L cannot be in position 2. So SLOBS would have L in position 2 – that’s invalid.

Next option: SLOID – O in position 2, L in position 3.
- S (pos 1 ✓)
- L (pos 3 – allowed)
- O (pos 2 – allowed)
- I, D are new letters not excluded.

This seems valid.

Another option: SLOID.

But let’s check if SLOID is a valid word – yes, it’s a valid word meaning a type of small stone.

But maybe simpler: SLOID.

However, let’s think of more common words. How about SLOTH – but H is excluded.

SLOBS is invalid because L would be in position 2.

SLOID seems the best next guess.

But let’s think of another: SLOID.

Alternatively, SLOID.

Another candidate: SLOID.

But let’s think of a word with L in position 3 or 4.

Another option: SLOID.

Actually, let’s try SLOID.

But to make it simpler, let’s try SLOID.

But let me think of a more common word: SLOID.

Actually, let’s try SLOID.

But perhaps a better word is SLOID.

Wait, let’s think differently: we have S _ _ _ _, and need to place L and O somewhere, with new letters.

Let’s try SLOID.

But let me think of a word with L in position 3: S _ L _ _, and O in position 2 or 4 or 5.

Candidate: S O L I D – but that’s S O L I D – but we need 5 letters starting with S.

Wait, S O L I D is 5 letters starting with S.

But S(1), O(2), L(3), I(4), D(5).

Check exclusions:
- S is allowed.
- O is allowed (in word, just not in position 3).
- L is allowed (not in position 2).
- I, D are new letters not excluded.

This seems valid.

So the word would be SOLID.

Let me check if SOLID is a valid 5-letter English word – yes, it is.

Therefore, the next guess is SOLID.

From the three guesses we now know:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is fixed in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SHORN → S(✓) H(x) O(-) R(x) N(x)
   - S is still in position 1.
   - H, R, N are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

3. SOLID → S(✓) O(✓) L(-) I(-) D(x)
   - S is fixed in position 1.
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - L is in the word but not in position 3 (and we already knew it wasn’t in position 2 from SLATE).
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - D is not in the word.

So far:
- Positions: S O _ _ _
- Letters known to be in the word: S, O, L, I
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, T, E, H, R, N, D

We need to place L and I in positions 3, 4, or 5, with the following constraints:
- L cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from SLATE and SOLID) → L must be in position 4 or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 → I must be in position 3, 4, or 5, but since L is in 4 or 5, I could be in 3 or 4 (but 4 might be taken by L).

Let’s list possible patterns:
- S O L _ _  → but L cannot be in position 3 (from SOLID feedback), so this is invalid.
- S O _ L _  → L in position 4 (allowed)
- S O _ _ L  → L in position 5 (allowed)

For each, we need a valid letter for the remaining slot, ensuring it’s not any of the excluded letters.

Case 1: S O _ L _
   - Position 3: must be a letter not excluded and not already used (S, O, L, I are used). Excluded letters so far: A, T, E, H, R, N, D. Remaining common letters: B, C, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
   - Possible letters for position 3: B, C, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
   - Need a valid 5-letter word: S O _ L _
   - Possible words: S O C L _?  S O P L _?  S O B L _?  S O G L _?
   - Checking: SOCLE – but E is excluded. SOPLA – not a word. SOBEL – not common. SOGGL – not a word. SOULY – not a word. SOKOL – valid word (a type of martial art).

Case 2: S O _ _ L
   - Position 3 and 4 need letters from remaining pool, with I needing to be placed somewhere (since I is in the word but not in position 4, it must be in position 3).
   - Pattern: S O I _ L
   - Position 4: must be a letter not excluded and not already used (S, O, I, L are used). Excluded letters: A, T, E, H, R, N, D. Remaining: B, C, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.
   - Need a valid 5-letter word: S O I _ L
   - Possible letters: B, C, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
   - Possible words: SOIKL – not a word. SOIML – not a word. SOIFL – not a word. SOIGL – not a word. SOIKL – no. Actually, checking valid words: SOILY – Y is allowed, but E is excluded, but Y is allowed. SOILY is a word (meaning resembling soil). But we have S O I L Y – but position 4 would be L, but we have S O I _ L, so position 4 would be Y. So SO I Y L – but that’s not a word. Wait, S O I _ L – position 4 must be a letter, so SO I C L – SOCIL – not a word. SO I M L – not a word. SO I P L – not a word. SO I G L – not a word. SO I B L – not a word. SO I K L – not a word. SO I V L – not a word. SO I W L – not a word. SO I F L – not a word. SO I U L – not a word. SO I Y L – not a word. Actually, SOILY is S O I L Y, but that would have L in position 4 and Y in position 5, but our pattern is S O _ _ L, so position 4 would be Y and position 5 would be L, but that would be S O _ Y L – but we have S O I _ L, so position 3 is I, position 4 is Y, position 5 is L – that would be S O I Y L – but that’s not a word. So maybe this path is invalid.

Thus, the only valid path seems to be S O _ L _ with L in position 4, and the remaining letter in position 3 must form a valid word. The only valid word found is SOKOL.

Therefore, the next guess is SOKOL.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- L is in the word but not in the second position (-).
- A, T, E are not in the word at all (x).

So we know:
1. Word starts with S.
2. L appears somewhere after the first letter.
3. No A, T, E.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and vowels while keeping the S fixed. Good letters to test now: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc. I’ll choose a word that places L in a different position and introduces new common letters.

A good candidate is ""SHORN"":
- S stays in position 1.
- H, O, R are new common letters.
- N is another common letter.
- L is moved to position 4 to see if it fits there instead of position 2.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is fixed in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SHORN → S(✓) H(x) O(-) R(x) N(x)
   - S is still in position 1 (confirmed).
   - H, R, N are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Letters in the word: S (pos 1), L (somewhere else), O (somewhere else).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, T, E, H, R, N.

Remaining common letters to test: D, I, C, U, M, P, B, G, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains both L and O.
- Does NOT contain A, T, E, H, R, N.

Possible candidates:
- SLOTH – but H is excluded.
- SLOBS – but B and S are okay, but we already have S in position 1.
- SLOTH – H excluded.
- SLOBS – B is okay, but we need to check if SLOBS contains any excluded letters. S, L, O, B, S – B is allowed.
- SLOBS seems valid.

Another candidate: SLOID – but D is okay, but I is okay, but O is in position 3 which is excluded.

Better to place O in position 2 or 4 or 5, and L in position 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try SLOBS:
- S (pos 1 ✓)
- L (pos 2 – but L was excluded from pos 2 in SLATE, but can be in pos 2 again since exclusion was only positional, not absolute. Wait, no – the feedback said L is in the word but not in position 2. So L cannot be in position 2. So SLOBS would have L in position 2 – that’s invalid.

Next option: SLOID – O in position 2, L in position 3.
- S (pos 1 ✓)
- L (pos 3 – allowed)
- O (pos 2 – allowed)
- I, D are new letters not excluded.

This seems valid.

Another option: SLOID.

But let’s check if SLOID is a valid word – yes, it’s a valid word meaning a type of small stone.

But maybe simpler: SLOID.

However, let’s think of more common words. How about SLOTH – but H is excluded.

SLOBS is invalid because L would be in position 2.

SLOID seems the best next guess.

But let’s think of another: SLOID.

Alternatively, SLOID.

Another candidate: SLOID.

But let’s think of a word with L in position 3 or 4.

Another option: SLOID.

Actually, let’s try SLOID.

But to make it simpler, let’s try SLOID.

But let me think of a more common word: SLOID.

Actually, let’s try SLOID.

But perhaps a better word is SLOID.

Wait, let’s think differently: we have S _ _ _ _, and need to place L and O somewhere, with new letters.

Let’s try SLOID.

But let me think of a word with L in position 3: S _ L _ _, and O in position 2 or 4 or 5.

Candidate: S O L I D – but that’s S O L I D – but we need 5 letters starting with S.

Wait, S O L I D is 5 letters starting with S.

But S(1), O(2), L(3), I(4), D(5).

Check exclusions:
- S is allowed.
- O is allowed (in word, just not in position 3).
- L is allowed (not in position 2).
- I, D are new letters not excluded.

This seems valid.

So the word would be SOLID.

Let me check if SOLID is a valid 5-letter English word – yes, it is.

Therefore, the next guess is SOLID.

From the three guesses we now know:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is fixed in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SHORN → S(✓) H(x) O(-) R(x) N(x)
   - S is still in position 1.
   - H, R, N are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

3. SOLID → S(✓) O(✓) L(-) I(-) D(x)
   - S is fixed in position 1.
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - L is in the word but not in position 3 (and we already knew it wasn’t in position 2 from SLATE).
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - D is not in the word.

So far:
- Positions: S O _ _ _
- Letters known to be in the word: S, O, L, I
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, T, E, H, R, N, D

We need to place L and I in positions 3, 4, or 5, with the following constraints:
- L cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from SLATE and SOLID) → L must be in position 4 or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 → I must be in position 3, 4, or 5, but since L is in 4 or 5, I could be in 3 or 4 (but 4 might be taken by L).

Let’s list possible patterns:
- S O L _ _  → but L cannot be in position 3 (from SOLID feedback), so this is invalid.
- S O _ L _  → L in position 4 (allowed)
- S O _ _ L  → L in position 5 (allowed)

For each, we need a valid letter for the remaining slot, ensuring it’s not any of the excluded letters.

Case 1: S O _ L _
   - Position 3: must be a letter not excluded and not already used (S, O, L, I are used). Excluded letters so far: A, T, E, H, R, N, D. Remaining common letters: B, C, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
   - Possible letters for position 3: B, C, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
   - Need a valid 5-letter word: S O _ L _
   - Possible words: S O C L _?  S O P L _?  S O B L _?  S O G L _?
   - Checking: SOCLE – but E is excluded. SOPLA – not a word. SOBEL – not common. SOGGL – not a word. SOULY – not a word. SOKOL – valid word (a type of martial art).

Case 2: S O _ _ L
   - Position 3 and 4 need letters from remaining pool, with I needing to be placed somewhere (since I is in the word but not in position 4, it must be in position 3).
   - Pattern: S O I _ L
   - Position 4: must be a letter not excluded and not already used (S, O, I, L are used). Excluded letters: A, T, E, H, R, N, D. Remaining: B, C, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.
   - Need a valid 5-letter word: S O I _ L
   - Possible letters: B, C, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
   - Possible words: SOIKL – not a word. SOIML – not a word. SOIFL – not a word. SOIGL – not a word. SOIKL – no. Actually, checking valid words: SOILY – Y is allowed, but E is excluded, but Y is allowed. SOILY is a word (meaning resembling soil). But we have S O I L Y – but position 4 would be L, but we have S O I _ L, so position 4 would be Y. So SO I Y L – but that’s not a word. Wait, S O I _ L – position 4 must be a letter, so SO I C L – SOCIL – not a word. SO I M L – not a word. SO I P L – not a word. SO I G L – not a word. SO I B L – not a word. SO I K L – not a word. SO I V L – not a word. SO I W L – not a word. SO I F L – not a word. SO I U L – not a word. SO I Y L – not a word. Actually, SOILY is S O I L Y, but that would have L in position 4 and Y in position 5, but our pattern is S O _ _ L, so position 4 would be Y and position 5 would be L, but that would be S O _ Y L – but we have S O I _ L, so position 3 is I, position 4 is Y, position 5 is L – that would be S O I Y L – but that’s not a word. So maybe this path is invalid.

Thus, the only valid path seems to be S O _ L _ with L in position 4, and the remaining letter in position 3 must form a valid word. The only valid word found is SOKOL.

Therefore, the next guess is SOKOL.

Let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)

   - A, T, E are absent.

   - S is correct in position 1.
   - H, R, N are absent.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

4. SOKOL → S(✓) O(✓) K(x) O(-) L(-)
   - S is correct in position 1.
   - O is correct in position 2.

   - The second O (position 3) is marked (-) – meaning O is in the word but not in position 3 (we already knew that from SHORN).
   - L is in the word but not in position 5 (from the last L(-)).

So far we have:
- S O _ _ _
- Letters known to be in the word: S, O, L, I
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, T, E, H, R, N, D, K
- L cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → must be in position 4.
- I cannot be in position 4 → must be in position 3 (since 4 is taken by L).

Thus the pattern is fixed:
S O I L _

Now we just need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with SOIL and ends with any letter not yet excluded. The remaining unused letters (not excluded) include: B, C, F, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking at common words:
- SOILB – not a word.

- SOILG – not a word.
- SOILM – not a word.
- SOILP – not a word.
