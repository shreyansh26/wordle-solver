### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"" are popular choices.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify many letters early on.

- A and S are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ R O _ E with the letters A and S ruled out.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"" are popular choices.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify many letters early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- O is in the correct position (third letter).
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter).
- A and S are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ R O _ E with the letters A and S ruled out.

We need to fill the first and fourth positions with letters that haven’t been ruled out yet. Common unused consonants include B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, etc., and vowels I and U (since A is out and O is already used).

Possible candidates:
- BROKE (B, K are new)
- CRORE (but “CRORE” isn’t a common English word)
- DROVE (D, V are new)
- GROPE (G, P are new)
- PROBE (P, B are new)
- TROPE (T, P are new)

Among these, “DROVE” is a common word and uses new letters D and V, which haven’t been tested yet.
