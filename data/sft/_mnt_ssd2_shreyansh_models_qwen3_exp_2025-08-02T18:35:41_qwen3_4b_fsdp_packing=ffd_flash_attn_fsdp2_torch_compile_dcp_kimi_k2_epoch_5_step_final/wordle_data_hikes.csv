2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 of these common letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants. This will give us good feedback on 5 different letters right away.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Since S and E must appear, I need a word that uses S and E in different positions than 4 and 5. Also, I want to avoid A, R, O entirely. Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, D, M, etc. 

A good second guess would be “STEIN”:
- S is in position 1 (was position 4 before, so new position).
- E is in position 2 (was position 5 before, so new position).
- T, I, N are new letters that are common and haven’t been tested yet.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N  
Letters that ARE in the word but are in the wrong positions: S, E, I  

So the secret word:
- Must contain S, E, I exactly once each.
- May NOT contain A, R, O, T, N.
- S is NOT in position 1.
- E is NOT in position 3.
- I is NOT in position 4.

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, E, I plus two new letters from the remaining pool, and respects the positional constraints.

Let’s try “MISLE”:
- M (new letter) in position 1
- I (known letter) in position 2
- S (known letter) in position 3 (allowed, since S was only forbidden in position 1)
- L (new letter) in position 4
- E (known letter) in position 5 (allowed, since E was only forbidden in position 3)

This satisfies all constraints and introduces two new letters (M and L) to narrow down possibilities.

Let's update what we know after the third guess:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N, M, L  
2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   - I is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2).  
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 3.  
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 5.  

So the word looks like: _ I _ _ _  
We still need to place S and E somewhere, and we have two more unknown letters.

Available positions for S: 2, 4, 5 (but 2 is already I), so 4 or 5  
Available positions for E: 1, 2, 4 (but 2 is already I), so 1 or 4  

We also need two more letters that are not in the forbidden list (A, R, O, T, N, M, L).  
Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y  
Vowels left: U (E is already used)

Let’s try to build a word:

Option 1: Place S in position 4 and E in position 1  
Word structure: E I S _ _  
We need two more letters not yet used. Let’s try C and D: E I S C D → “EISCD” – not a valid word.  
Try E I S C H → “EISCH” – not valid.  
Try E I S K Y → “EISKY” – not valid.  
Try E I S C U → “EISCU” – not valid.  

Option 2: Place S in position 5 and E in position 1  
Word structure: E I _ _ S  
Need two letters for positions 3 and 4.  
Try E I N G S – but N is forbidden.  
Try E I G H S – “EIGHTS” is 6 letters.  
Try E I G H S – “EIGHT” is 5 letters, but T is forbidden.  
Try E I D S – too short.  
Try E I C H S – not valid.  

Option 3: Place S in position 4 and E in position 4 – impossible.

Need a letter for position 3 and 5.  
Try E I C S D – not valid.  
Try E I C S H – not valid.  
Try E I C S K – not valid.  

Let’s try a different approach: pick a valid word that fits the constraints.

Valid 5-letter words with I in position 2, containing S and E, avoiding forbidden letters.

Try “CISKE” – not valid.  
Try “HISSE” – not valid.  
Try “PIECE” – but E is in position 5, which is forbidden.

Try “WISPS” – no E.  

Try “PIECE” – E in position 5 is forbidden.  

Try “DICES” – S in position 5 is allowed, E in position 4 is allowed.  
Check letters: D, I, C, E, S  
Forbidden letters: A, R, O, T, N, M, L – none of these appear.  
Check positions:  
- I is in position 2 (correct)  
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S was only forbidden in 1 and 3)  
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since E was only forbidden in 3 and 5)  

“DICES” is a valid English word.

So the next guess is DICES.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 of these common letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants. This will give us good feedback on 5 different letters right away.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Since S and E must appear, I need a word that uses S and E in different positions than 4 and 5. Also, I want to avoid A, R, O entirely. Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, D, M, etc. 

A good second guess would be “STEIN”:
- S is in position 1 (was position 4 before, so new position).
- E is in position 2 (was position 5 before, so new position).
- T, I, N are new letters that are common and haven’t been tested yet.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N  
Letters that ARE in the word but are in the wrong positions: S, E, I  

So the secret word:
- Must contain S, E, I exactly once each.
- May NOT contain A, R, O, T, N.
- S is NOT in position 1.
- E is NOT in position 3.
- I is NOT in position 4.

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, E, I plus two new letters from the remaining pool, and respects the positional constraints.

Let’s try “MISLE”:
- M (new letter) in position 1
- I (known letter) in position 2
- S (known letter) in position 3 (allowed, since S was only forbidden in position 1)
- L (new letter) in position 4
- E (known letter) in position 5 (allowed, since E was only forbidden in position 3)

This satisfies all constraints and introduces two new letters (M and L) to narrow down possibilities.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 of these common letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants. This will give us good feedback on 5 different letters right away.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Since S and E must appear, I need a word that uses S and E in different positions than 4 and 5. Also, I want to avoid A, R, O entirely. Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, D, M, etc. 

A good second guess would be “STEIN”:
- S is in position 1 (was position 4 before, so new position).
- E is in position 2 (was position 5 before, so new position).
- T, I, N are new letters that are common and haven’t been tested yet.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N  
Letters that ARE in the word but are in the wrong positions: S, E, I  

So the secret word:
- Must contain S, E, I exactly once each.
- May NOT contain A, R, O, T, N.
- S is NOT in position 1.
- E is NOT in position 3.
- I is NOT in position 4.

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, E, I plus two new letters from the remaining pool, and respects the positional constraints.

Let’s try “MISLE”:
- M (new letter) in position 1
- I (known letter) in position 2
- S (known letter) in position 3 (allowed, since S was only forbidden in position 1)
- L (new letter) in position 4
- E (known letter) in position 5 (allowed, since E was only forbidden in position 3)

This satisfies all constraints and introduces two new letters (M and L) to narrow down possibilities.

Guess 3: MISLE -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) S(-) L(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>

Let's update what we know after the third guess:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N, M, L  
2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   - I is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2).  
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 3.  
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 5.  

So the word looks like: _ I _ _ _  
We still need to place S and E somewhere, and we have two more unknown letters.

Available positions for S: 2, 4, 5 (but 2 is already I), so 4 or 5  
Available positions for E: 1, 2, 4 (but 2 is already I), so 1 or 4  

We also need two more letters that are not in the forbidden list (A, R, O, T, N, M, L).  
Common remaining consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y  
Vowels left: U (E is already used)

Let’s try to build a word:

Option 1: Place S in position 4 and E in position 1  
Word structure: E I S _ _  
We need two more letters not yet used. Let’s try C and D: E I S C D → “EISCD” – not a valid word.  
Try E I S C H → “EISCH” – not valid.  
Try E I S K Y → “EISKY” – not valid.  
Try E I S C U → “EISCU” – not valid.  

Option 2: Place S in position 5 and E in position 1  
Word structure: E I _ _ S  
Need two letters for positions 3 and 4.  
Try E I N G S – but N is forbidden.  
Try E I G H S – “EIGHTS” is 6 letters.  
Try E I G H S – “EIGHT” is 5 letters, but T is forbidden.  
Try E I D S – too short.  
Try E I C H S – not valid.  

Option 3: Place S in position 4 and E in position 4 – impossible.  

Option 4: Place E in position 4 and S in position 5  
Word structure: _ I _ E S  
Positions 1 and 3 need two new letters.  
Try C and H: C I H E S – not valid.  
Try P and U: P I U E S – not valid.  
Try D and U: D I U E S – not valid.  

Option 5: Place E in position 1 and S in position 4  
Word structure: E I _ S _  
Need a letter for position 3 and 5.  
Try E I C S D – not valid.  
Try E I C S H – not valid.  
Try E I C S K – not valid.  

Let’s try a different approach: pick a valid word that fits the constraints.

Valid 5-letter words with I in position 2, containing S and E, avoiding forbidden letters.

Try “CISKE” – not valid.  
Try “HISSE” – not valid.  
Try “PIECE” – but E is in position 5, which is forbidden.  
Try “SIEGE” – S is in position 1, which is forbidden.  
Try “WISPE” – not valid.  

Try “PIECE” – but E in position 5 is forbidden.  
Try “DICEY” – no S.  
Try “VICE” – too short.  

Try “SIEGE” – S in position 1 is forbidden.  
Try “WISPS” – no E.  

Try “PIECE” – E in position 5 is forbidden.  

Try “SIEGE” – S in position 1 is forbidden.  

Try “WISPS” – no E.  

Try “PIECE” – E in position 5 is forbidden.  

Try “DICES” – S in position 5 is allowed, E in position 4 is allowed.  
Check letters: D, I, C, E, S  
Forbidden letters: A, R, O, T, N, M, L – none of these appear.  
Check positions:  
- I is in position 2 (correct)  
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S was only forbidden in 1 and 3)  
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since E was only forbidden in 3 and 5)  

“DICES” is a valid English word.

So the next guess is DICES.

From the feedback so far:

- Positions 2, 4, 5 are locked: I _ E S  
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N, M, L, D, C, P  
- Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:  
  – I in position 2  
  – K in position 3  
  – E in position 4  
  – S in position 5  

So the pattern is: _ I K E S

Only position 1 is unknown.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need a 5-letter English word that starts with one of these and ends with IKES.

Valid English words fitting _IKES:  
- BIKES  
- FIKES (archaic, but accepted in Scrabble)  
- GIKES (not a standard word)  
- HIKES  
- VIKES (variant spelling of “vixens,” but uncommon)  
- WIKES (plural of “wick” or surname)  

Among these, “HIKES” is the most common and valid word.

Check letters: H has not been ruled out.  
Therefore, HIKES is the logical next guess.
