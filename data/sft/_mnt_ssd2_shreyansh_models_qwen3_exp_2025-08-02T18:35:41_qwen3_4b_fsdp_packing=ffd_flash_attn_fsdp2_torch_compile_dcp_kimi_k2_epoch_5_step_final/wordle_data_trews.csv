### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, T, N, S, L, etc. A popular choice is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- S (must be in positions 2 or 5, since it was “-” in positions 1 and 2)
- T (must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5, since it was “-” in position 4)
- E (must be in position 3, since it was “✓” there)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- L, A, P

So the word looks like: _ _ E _ _

With S and T still to place, and the remaining two positions filled with letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns:
- S must appear exactly once (since it only showed up once in feedback) and must be in position 2 or 5.
- T must appear exactly once (same reasoning) and must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. But position 3 is already E, so 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s try placing S in position 2 and T in position 1:
T S E _ _

We need one more letter for position 4 and 5. Available letters (not L, A, P) include R, N, D, C, etc. A common word that fits is “TENSE”.

Check constraints:
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- S in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 3 (matches ✓)
- N and E are allowed (no L, A, P)

“TENSE” satisfies all constraints.

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.

   – T is in the word but not in position 4.
   – E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. STEPS → S(-) T(-) E(✓) P(x) S(✓)
   – E is fixed in position 3.
   – S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (so it must be 3, 4, or 5). However, position 3 is already E, so S must be 4 or 5.
   – T is in the word but not in position 2.
   – P is not in the word.

3. TENSE → T(✓) E(-) N(x) S(-) E(-)
   – T is fixed in position 1.
   – E is in the word but not in position 2 (but we already know it’s in position 3, so this is consistent).
   – N is not in the word.
   – S is in the word but not in position 4 (so S must be in position 5).
   – The last E is irrelevant because we already have E in position 3.

Putting it all together:
- Position 1: T (✓)
- Position 3: E (✓)
- Position 5: S (must be here)
- Positions 2 and 4: letters not yet ruled out (not L, A, P, N).

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word with pattern T _ E _ S.

Possible candidates:
- TIDES – but D is allowed, I is allowed, but we need to check if I and D are ruled out. They are not.
- TIGER – but R is allowed, G is allowed.
- TOWER – O, W, R are allowed.
- TIRED – I, R, D are allowed.
- TUBES – U, B are allowed.
- TWEES – W, E (but E is already used in position 3, and we can’t have two E’s unless the word has two E’s. The rules don’t forbid duplicate letters, but we need to check if the word TWEES is valid. It is a valid word meaning “to repeat something in a teasing manner.”
- TWEET – but T is already in position 1, and we don’t know if duplicate T’s are allowed. The rules don’t forbid it, but we need to check if TWEET is valid. It is, but we might prefer a word with distinct letters.

Let’s try TIGER:
- T I G E R
- Positions: 1=T, 2=I, 3=E, 4=G, 5=R
- Check constraints:
  – T is in position 1 (✓ from TENSE)
  – E is in position 3 (✓ from STEPS)
  – S is in position 5 (must be here)
  – I and G are not ruled out.
  – Word is valid.

However, we know S must be in position 5, so the word must end with S. Therefore, the pattern is T _ E _ S.

Looking for valid words ending in S:
- TIGES – but G is allowed, I is allowed, but TIGES is not a common word.
- TIRES – ends with S? TIRES ends with S? No, TIRES ends with S? TIRES is T-I-R-E-S, which ends with S. Yes, that fits.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, T, N, S, L, etc. A popular choice is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L(x): L is not in the word at all.
- A(x): A is not in the word at all.
- T(-): T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A
- Letters that ARE in the word: S, T, E (each in a different position than shown)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, T, E
- Does NOT contain L or A
- S is not in position 1
- T is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is ""STEPS"":
- Contains S, T, E
- No L or A
- S is in position 2 (allowed)
- T is in position 1 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (allowed)

This seems like a strong next guess.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- S (must be in positions 2 or 5, since it was “-” in positions 1 and 2)
- T (must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5, since it was “-” in position 4)
- E (must be in position 3, since it was “✓” there)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- L, A, P

So the word looks like: _ _ E _ _

With S and T still to place, and the remaining two positions filled with letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns:
- S must appear exactly once (since it only showed up once in feedback) and must be in position 2 or 5.
- T must appear exactly once (same reasoning) and must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. But position 3 is already E, so 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s try placing S in position 2 and T in position 1:
T S E _ _

We need one more letter for position 4 and 5. Available letters (not L, A, P) include R, N, D, C, etc. A common word that fits is “TENSE”.

Check constraints:
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- S in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 3 (matches ✓)
- N and E are allowed (no L, A, P)

“TENSE” satisfies all constraints.

Let’s update the knowledge after the fourth guess.

Current constraints:

1. T is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. E is fixed in position 3 (✓ from STEPS).
3. S is fixed in position 5 (✓ from TIRES).
4. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, A, P, N, I.
5. R is in the word but not in position 4 (from TIRES feedback: R(-)).
6. Positions 2 and 4 are still open, but:
   – Position 2 cannot be I (already ruled out), and must be a letter not in {L, A, P, N, I}.
   – Position 4 cannot be R (already ruled out), and must be a letter not in {L, A, P, N, I}.

So the word pattern is: T _ E _ S

Allowed letters for positions 2 and 4 (excluding the ruled-out set):
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus R for position 2, since R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 4).

We also know R must appear somewhere, so R must be in position 2 (since position 4 is excluded).

Therefore:
- Position 2: R
- Position 4: must be a letter not yet ruled out and not R.

Now we need a letter for position 4 from the remaining allowed set. Common letters left: B, C, D, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, Y.

Possible words:
- T R E _ S
Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern:
- TREES – but E is already in position 3, and we can’t have two E’s unless the word allows it. TREES is T-R-E-E-S, which has two E’s. The rules don’t forbid duplicate letters, but we need to check if TREES is valid. It is.
- T R E B S – not a valid word.
- T R E C S – not valid.
- T R E D S – not valid.
- T R E G S – not valid.
- T R E K S – valid (plural of trek).
- T R E M S – not valid.
- T R E W S – not valid.
- T R E Y S – valid (plural of try).

Between TREES, TREAKS, and TRESY, the valid common words are TREES and TREAKS (but TREAKS is less common), and TRESY is not a word. So TREES is the most likely.

But let’s verify:
- TREES:
  – T(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), S(5)
  – R is in position 2, which satisfies R(-) from TIRES (R is in the word but not in position 4).
  – All other letters are allowed.
  – Word is valid.

Therefore, the next guess should be TREES.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, T, N, S, L, etc. A popular choice is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L(x): L is not in the word at all.
- A(x): A is not in the word at all.
- T(-): T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A
- Letters that ARE in the word: S, T, E (each in a different position than shown)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, T, E
- Does NOT contain L or A
- S is not in position 1
- T is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is ""STEPS"":
- Contains S, T, E
- No L or A
- S is in position 2 (allowed)
- T is in position 1 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (allowed)

This seems like a strong next guess.

Guess 2: STEPS -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(✓) P(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s summarize what we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- S (must be in positions 2 or 5, since it was “-” in positions 1 and 2)
- T (must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5, since it was “-” in position 4)
- E (must be in position 3, since it was “✓” there)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- L, A, P

So the word looks like: _ _ E _ _

With S and T still to place, and the remaining two positions filled with letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns:
- S must appear exactly once (since it only showed up once in feedback) and must be in position 2 or 5.
- T must appear exactly once (same reasoning) and must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. But position 3 is already E, so 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s try placing S in position 2 and T in position 1:
T S E _ _

We need one more letter for position 4 and 5. Available letters (not L, A, P) include R, N, D, C, etc. A common word that fits is “TENSE”.

Check constraints:
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- S in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 3 (matches ✓)
- N and E are allowed (no L, A, P)

“TENSE” satisfies all constraints.

Let’s update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.
   – L and A are not in the word.
   – T is in the word but not in position 4.
   – E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. STEPS → S(-) T(-) E(✓) P(x) S(✓)
   – E is fixed in position 3.
   – S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (so it must be 3, 4, or 5). However, position 3 is already E, so S must be 4 or 5.
   – T is in the word but not in position 2.
   – P is not in the word.

3. TENSE → T(✓) E(-) N(x) S(-) E(-)
   – T is fixed in position 1.
   – E is in the word but not in position 2 (but we already know it’s in position 3, so this is consistent).
   – N is not in the word.
   – S is in the word but not in position 4 (so S must be in position 5).
   – The last E is irrelevant because we already have E in position 3.

Putting it all together:
- Position 1: T (✓)
- Position 3: E (✓)
- Position 5: S (must be here)
- Positions 2 and 4: letters not yet ruled out (not L, A, P, N).

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word with pattern T _ E _ S.

Possible candidates:
- TIDES – but D is allowed, I is allowed, but we need to check if I and D are ruled out. They are not.
- TIGER – but R is allowed, G is allowed.
- TOWER – O, W, R are allowed.
- TIRED – I, R, D are allowed.
- TUBES – U, B are allowed.
- TWEES – W, E (but E is already used in position 3, and we can’t have two E’s unless the word has two E’s. The rules don’t forbid duplicate letters, but we need to check if the word TWEES is valid. It is a valid word meaning “to repeat something in a teasing manner.”
- TWEET – but T is already in position 1, and we don’t know if duplicate T’s are allowed. The rules don’t forbid it, but we need to check if TWEET is valid. It is, but we might prefer a word with distinct letters.

Let’s try TIGER:
- T I G E R
- Positions: 1=T, 2=I, 3=E, 4=G, 5=R
- Check constraints:
  – T is in position 1 (✓ from TENSE)
  – E is in position 3 (✓ from STEPS)
  – S is in position 5 (must be here)
  – I and G are not ruled out.
  – Word is valid.

However, we know S must be in position 5, so the word must end with S. Therefore, the pattern is T _ E _ S.

Looking for valid words ending in S:
- TIGES – but G is allowed, I is allowed, but TIGES is not a common word.
- TIRES – ends with S? TIRES ends with S? No, TIRES ends with S? TIRES is T-I-R-E-S, which ends with S. Yes, that fits.
- TIRES:
  – T I R E S
  – Positions: 1=T, 2=I, 3=E, 4=R, 5=S
  – I and R are not ruled out.
  – Word is valid.

Another candidate is TIGES, but TIRES is more common.

Let’s go with TIRES.

Current constraints:

1. T is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. E is fixed in position 3 (✓ from STEPS).
3. S is fixed in position 5 (✓ from TIRES).
4. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, A, P, N, I.
5. R is in the word but not in position 4 (from TIRES feedback: R(-)).
6. Positions 2 and 4 are still open, but:
   – Position 2 cannot be I (already ruled out), and must be a letter not in {L, A, P, N, I}.
   – Position 4 cannot be R (already ruled out), and must be a letter not in {L, A, P, N, I}.

So the word pattern is: T _ E _ S

Allowed letters for positions 2 and 4 (excluding the ruled-out set):
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus R for position 2, since R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 4).

We also know R must appear somewhere, so R must be in position 2 (since position 4 is excluded).

Therefore:
- Position 2: R
- Position 4: must be a letter not yet ruled out and not R.

Now we need a letter for position 4 from the remaining allowed set. Common letters left: B, C, D, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, Y.

Possible words:
- T R E _ S
Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern:
- TREES – but E is already in position 3, and we can’t have two E’s unless the word allows it. TREES is T-R-E-E-S, which has two E’s. The rules don’t forbid duplicate letters, but we need to check if TREES is valid. It is.
- T R E B S – not a valid word.
- T R E C S – not valid.
- T R E D S – not valid.
- T R E G S – not valid.
- T R E K S – valid (plural of trek).
- T R E M S – not valid.
- T R E W S – not valid.
- T R E Y S – valid (plural of try).

Between TREES, TREAKS, and TRESY, the valid common words are TREES and TREAKS (but TREAKS is less common), and TRESY is not a word. So TREES is the most likely.

But let’s verify:
- TREES:
  – T(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), S(5)
  – R is in position 2, which satisfies R(-) from TIRES (R is in the word but not in position 4).

Yes, that fits.\n- TIRES:\n  – T I R E S\n  – Positions: 1=T, 2=I, 3=E, 4=R, 5=S\n  – I and R are not ruled out.\n  – Word is valid.\n\nAnother candidate is TIGES, but TIRES is more common.\n\nLet’s go with TIRES.\n\n<guess>TIRES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: STEPS -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(✓) P(x) S(✓)\nGuess 3: TENSE -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) E(-) N(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 4: TIRES -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) I(x) R(-) E(-) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let’s update the knowledge after the fourth guess.\n\nCurrent constraints:\n\n1.

R is in the word but not in position 4 (from TIRES feedback: R(-)).\n6. Positions 2 and 4 are still open, but:\n   – Position 2 cannot be I (already ruled out), and must be a letter not in {L, A, P, N, I}.\n   – Position 4 cannot be R (already ruled out), and must be a letter not in {L, A, P, N, I}.\n\nSo the word pattern is: T _ E _ S\n\nAllowed letters for positions 2 and 4 (excluding the ruled-out set):\nB, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus R for position 2, since R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 4).\n\nWe also know R must appear somewhere, so R must be in position 2 (since position 4 is excluded).\n\nTherefore:\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 4: must be a letter not yet ruled out and not R.\n\nNow we need a letter for position 4 from the remaining allowed set. Common letters left: B, C, D, G, H, K, M, O, U, W, Y.\n\nPossible words:\n- T R E _ S\nLooking for valid 5-letter words fitting this pattern:\n- TREES – but E is already in position 3, and we can’t have two E’s unless the word allows it. TREES is T-R-E-E-S, which has two E’s. The rules don’t forbid duplicate letters, but we need to check if TREES is valid. It is.\n- T R E B S – not a valid word.\n- T R E C S – not valid.\n- T R E D S – not valid.\n- T R E G S – not valid.\n- T R E K S – valid (plural of trek).\n- T R E M S – not valid.\n- T R E W S – not valid.\n- T R E Y S – valid (plural of try).\n\nBetween TREES, TREAKS, and TRESY, the valid common words are TREES and TREAKS (but TREAKS is less common), and TRESY is not a word. So TREES is the most likely.\n\nBut let’s verify:\n- TREES:\n  – T(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), S(5)\n  – R is in position 2, which satisfies R(-) from TIRES (R is in the word but not in position 4).\n  – All other letters are allowed.\n  – Word is valid.\n\nTherefore, the next guess should be TREES.\n\n<guess>TREES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: STEPS -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(✓) P(x) S(✓)\nGuess 3: TENSE -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) E(-) N(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 4: TIRES -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) I(x) R(-) E(-) S(✓)\nGuess 5: TREES -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) E(✓) E(-) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback:

- T is ✓ in position 1  
- R is ✓ in position 2  
- E is ✓ in position 3  
- E is - in position 4 → the second E is NOT in position 4, but we already have E in position 3, so this simply confirms no second E is needed.  
- S is ✓ in position 5  

Therefore the word must be: T R E _ S  
The only blank is position 4.  

Letters already ruled out: L, A, P, N, I  
Letters still allowed for position 4: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form T R E _ S.  
Scanning the dictionary, the only common English word that fits is T R E K S.  

Check constraints:
- T, R, E, S are already fixed in positions 1, 2, 3, 5.  
- K has not been ruled out.  
- Word is valid.  

So the next (and final) guess is T R E K S.
