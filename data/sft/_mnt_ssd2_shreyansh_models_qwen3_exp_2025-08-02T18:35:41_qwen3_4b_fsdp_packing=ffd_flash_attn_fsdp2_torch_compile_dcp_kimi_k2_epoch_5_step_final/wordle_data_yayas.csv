### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at these letters, I can form several good candidates. Words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""SLATE"", etc., are all strong first guesses. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Next step: pick a word that uses A and S in new positions, avoids R, O, E, and introduces other common letters.

Good candidates: SLANT, STAND, SANER, SNACK, etc.

- It uses S in position 1 (new for S) and A in position 2 (new for A).  
- It introduces T, N, D which are common.

From the two guesses we now have:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N, D
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, S
   - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
   - S cannot be in positions 1 or 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and S
- Places A in positions 2, 4, or 5
- Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5
- Uses only letters from the remaining common set (B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.)

Let’s list possible positions:
- A could be 2, 4, or 5
- S could be 2, 3, or 5

We need to avoid conflicts. Let’s try:
- A in position 2
- S in position 3
This gives the pattern: _ A S _ _

We need two more letters from the remaining pool. Common consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y

Let’s try “BASIC”:
- B, I, C are still possible
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- S is in position 3 (allowed)
- I and C are new letters we haven’t tested yet

This seems like a good third guess to test new letters while respecting the constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at these letters, I can form several good candidates. Words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""SLATE"", etc., are all strong first guesses. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(x): R is NOT in the word  
- O(x): O is NOT the word  
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4  
- E(x): E is NOT in the word  

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but wrong positions): A, S  
- The word contains A and S, but A ≠ 1st letter, S ≠ 4th letter.

Next step: pick a word that uses A and S in new positions, avoids R, O, E, and introduces other common letters.

Good candidates: SLANT, STAND, SANER, SNACK, etc.  
I’ll choose “STAND” because:
- It uses S in position 1 (new for S) and A in position 2 (new for A).  
- It introduces T, N, D which are common.  
- It avoids R, O, E.

(If STAND fails, we’ll know more about T, N, D.)

From the two guesses we now have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1
   - S is in the word but not in position 4

2. stand → S(-) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1
   - A is in the word but not in position 3
   - T, N, D are NOT in the word

So we now know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N, D
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, S
   - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
   - S cannot be in positions 1 or 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and S
- Places A in positions 2, 4, or 5
- Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5
- Uses only letters from the remaining common set (B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.)

Let’s list possible positions:
- A could be 2, 4, or 5
- S could be 2, 3, or 5

We need to avoid conflicts. Let’s try:
- A in position 2
- S in position 3
This gives the pattern: _ A S _ _

We need two more letters from the remaining pool. Common consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y

Let’s try “BASIC”:
- B, I, C are still possible
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- S is in position 3 (allowed)
- I and C are new letters we haven’t tested yet

This seems like a good third guess to test new letters while respecting the constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at these letters, I can form several good candidates. Words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""SLATE"", etc., are all strong first guesses. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(x): R is NOT in the word  
- O(x): O is NOT the word  
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4  
- E(x): E is NOT in the word  

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but wrong positions): A, S  
- The word contains A and S, but A ≠ 1st letter, S ≠ 4th letter.

Next step: pick a word that uses A and S in new positions, avoids R, O, E, and introduces other common letters.

Good candidates: SLANT, STAND, SANER, SNACK, etc.  
I’ll choose “STAND” because:
- It uses S in position 1 (new for S) and A in position 2 (new for A).  
- It introduces T, N, D which are common.  
- It avoids R, O, E.

(If STAND fails, we’ll know more about T, N, D.)

Guess 2: stand -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we now have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1
   - S is in the word but not in position 4

2. stand → S(-) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1
   - A is in the word but not in position 3
   - T, N, D are NOT in the word

So we now know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N, D
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, S
   - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
   - S cannot be in positions 1 or 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and S
- Places A in positions 2, 4, or 5
- Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5
- Uses only letters from the remaining common set (B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.)

Let’s list possible positions:
- A could be 2, 4, or 5
- S could be 2, 3, or 5

We need to avoid conflicts. Let’s try:
- A in position 2
- S in position 3
This gives the pattern: _ A S _ _

We need two more letters from the remaining pool. Common consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y

Let’s try “BASIC”:
- B, I, C are still possible
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- S is in position 3 (allowed)
- I and C are new letters we haven’t tested yet

This seems like a good third guess to test new letters while respecting the constraints.

   - A is in the word and is in position 2 (✓)
   - S is in the word but not position 3
   - B, I, C are not in the word

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N, D, B, I, C
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (position 2), S
   - S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4 (from arose, stand, basic)
   - Therefore S must be in position 5

Current pattern: _ A _ _ S

We still need letters for positions 1, 3, 4 from the remaining common letters:
Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want common consonants to maximize information. Good candidates: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, W, Y

Let’s try to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with these letters while forming valid words.

Possible patterns:
- Position 1: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, W, Y
- Position 3: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
- Position 4: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Let’s look for common words that fit _ A _ _ S:

- F A _ _ S: FAHRS (not common), FAKES (K,E eliminated), FALMS (not common)
- G A _ _ S: GAVAS (not common), GULAS (not common)
- H A _ _ S: HABAS (not common), HAKAS (not common)
- K A _ _ S: KALAS (not common), KASAS (not common)
- L A _ _ S: LAMAS (M,A already used), LASSO (O eliminated)
- M A _ _ S: MASAS (S already in position 5), MAFIA (I eliminated)
- P A _ _ S: PAPAS (P already in position 1), PAVAS (not common)
- W A _ _ S: WAKAS (not common)
- Y A _ _ S: YAKAS (not common)

Hmm, none of these are common. Let me think differently - maybe position 3 or 4 can be vowels we haven't tried yet. The only vowels left are U and Y (sometimes).

Looking for words:
- _ A U _ S: FAULS (not common), HAULS (H,A,U,L,S - common word)
- _ A _ U S: FAULT (T eliminated), HAULS (already considered), MALUS (M,A,L,U,S - common word)

HAULS fits _ A U _ S:
H A U L S
- H in position 1 (new)
- A in position 2 (correct)
- U in position 3 (new)
- L in position 4 (new)
- S in position 5 (correct)

Words like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""SLATE"", etc., are all strong first guesses. \n\nI\'ll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants.

From the latest feedback on “gazas”:

- G(x) → G is NOT in the word  
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 (confirmed)  
- Z(x) → Z is NOT in the word  
- A(✓) → A is in position 4 (confirmed)  
- S(✓) → S is in position 5 (confirmed)

So the pattern is now: _ A _ A S

Letters already eliminated: R, O, E, T, N, D, B, I, C, H, U, L, G, Z  
Remaining possible letters: F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, plus any others not yet ruled out.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2 and S in position 5  
- Has A in position 4 (so the word has two A’s)  
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool

The pattern is: ? A ? A S

Looking for common words that fit ? A ? A S:

- F A K A S → FAKAS (not common)  
- M A C A S → MACAS (C is eliminated)  
- P A P A S → PAPAS (P is allowed, but double P is fine)  
- W A K A S → WAKAS (K is allowed)  
- Y A K A S → YAKAS (K is allowed)  

Among these, PAPAS is a very common word and uses only allowed letters (P is still possible).

PAPAS:
- P in position 1 (new)  
- A in position 2 (correct)  
- P in position 3 (new)  
- A in position 4 (correct)  
- S in position 5 (correct)

This seems like the most promising final guess.
