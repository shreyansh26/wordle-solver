- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5
Let's consider each:
- If L is in position 1: L E _ I _
- If L is in position 3: _ E L I _
- If L is in position 5: _ E _ I L

Looking for common words that fit:
- L E _ I _ : ""LEMON"" has M and N (both allowed), but M and N haven't been tested yet. However, we need to check if M and N are allowed (they haven't been ruled out).
- _ E L I _ : ""BELIE"" isn't valid, ""FELIC"" isn't valid.
- _ E _ I L : ""PELIC"" isn't valid, ""HEXIL"" isn't valid.

""LEMON"" seems valid:
- L E M I N
- Letters used: L, E, M, I, N (none of which are ruled out)
- Positions: L in 1 (new), E in 2 (correct), I in 4 (correct), M and N new letters

This seems like a good next guess to test M and N while confirming L's position.

Let's update what we know from all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T
   - Letters IN the word but wrong position: L, E

2. RELIC → R(x) E(✓) L(-) I(✓) C(x)
   - E is in the correct position (position 2)
   - I is in the correct position (position 4)
   - Letters NOT in the word: R, C
   - L is still in the word but wrong position

3. LEMON → L(-) E(✓) M(-) O(x) N(-)
   - E is still correct in position 2
   - I is still correct in position 4
   - Letters NOT in the word: O
   - Letters in the word but wrong position: L, M, N
   - L is now known NOT to be in position 1
   - M is now known NOT to be in position 3
   - N is now known NOT to be in position 5

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ E _ I _
- Letters definitely in the word: E, I, L, M, N (but each in wrong positions so far)
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, A, T, R, C, O
- L cannot be in positions 1 or 2 or 4 → must be in position 3 or 5
- M cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but 4 is I) → position 1 or 5
- N cannot be in position 5 → must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is I) → position 1 or 3

Let's try to place L, M, N into the remaining slots (positions 1, 3, 5):

Possible assignments:
- L: 3 or 5
- M: 1 or 5
- N: 1 or 3

We need to find a valid 5-letter word that fits _ E _ I _ and uses L, M, N in the remaining positions.

Looking at possible combinations:
- If L is in position 3: _ E L I _
  - Then M and N must go into positions 1 and 5 (since 5 is open and N can't be 5 if M is there, but N can be 5 if M is 1)
  - Possible words: M E L I N  (but N would be in position 5 which is allowed)
  - Check if MELIN is a valid word → it's not standard
  - Try N E L I M → NELIM is not valid
- If L is in position 5: _ E _ I L
  - Then M and N must go into positions 1 and 3
  - Possible words: M E N I L  (MENIL is not valid)
  - N E M I L  (NEMIL is not valid)

Hmm, these aren't valid words. Let's think differently - maybe the word uses only some of L, M, N and other letters.

Wait, we know E and I are fixed, and L must appear somewhere (positions 3 or 5), but the word doesn't necessarily contain all of L, M, N.

Let me re-examine the constraints:
- Letters definitely in the word: E (pos 2), I (pos 4), plus at least one of L, M, N (but not necessarily all)
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, R, C, O
- L must be in position 3 or 5
- M must be in position 1 or 5
- N must be in position 1 or 3

Let's try L in position 3:
- _ E L I _
  - Position 1: could be M or N
  - Position 5: could be N or M
  - Valid word: M E L I N  (not valid)
  - Valid word: N E L I M  (not valid)

Try L in position 5:
- _ E _ I L
  - Position 1: could be M or N
  - Position 3: could be N or M
  - Valid word: M E N I L  (not valid)
  - Valid word: N E M I L  (not valid)

These aren't working. Maybe the word uses other letters. Let's think of common 5-letter words with pattern _ E _ I _ that don't use S, A, T, R, C, O.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We know L must be in position 3 or 5, and M/N must fit.

Let's try L in position 3:
- _ E L I _
  - Position 1: M or N
  - Position 5: N or M
  - Valid word: M E L I N  (not valid)
  - Valid word: N E L I M  (not valid)

Try L in position 5:
- _ E _ I L
  - Position 1: M or N
  - Position 3: N or M
  - Valid word: M E N I L  (not valid)
  - Valid word: N E M I L  (not valid)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Maybe the word uses only some of L, M, N. Let's think of other possibilities.

Wait, the word must contain E (pos 2) and I (pos 4), and at least one of L, M, N. Let's try:

- L in position 3: _ E L I _
  - Position 1: B (new letter)
  - Position 5: M (new letter)
  - Word: B E L I M  (BELIM - not valid)
  - Position 1: N (new letter)
  - Position 5: M (new letter)
  - Word: N E L I M  (NELIM - not valid)

- L in position 5: _ E _ I L
  - Position 1: M (new letter)
  - Position 3: N (new letter)
  - Word: M E N I L  (MENIL - not valid)
  - Position 1: N (new letter)
  - Position 3: M (new letter)
  - Word: N E M I L  (NEMIL - not valid)

This is tricky. Let me think of actual words that fit _ E _ I _ and use allowed letters.

Common words with pattern _ E _ I _:
- BEIGE (but O is out)
- FEIGN (but N is allowed, but G hasn't been tested)
- MELEE (but A is out)
- PEKIN (but K hasn't been tested)
- WEEPS (but S is out)

Looking at these, ""FEIGN"" seems possible:
- F E I G N
- Letters used: F, E, I, G, N
- E is correct in position 2
- I is correct in position 4
- N is in the word but position 5 was previously marked as wrong for N, but in LEMON N was in position 5 and marked as wrong, so N cannot be in position 5
- In FEIGN, N is in position 5 - this is invalid

""PEKIN"":
- P E K I N
- E in 2 (correct)
- I in 4 (correct)
- K and N are new letters
- N is in position 5 - invalid (from LEMON feedback)

""MELEE"":
- M E E L E
- E in 2 (correct)
- I is missing - invalid

""BEIGE"":
- B E I G E
- E in 2 (correct)
- I in 4 (correct)
- G is new letter
- E in 5 is fine
- B is new letter
- This fits all constraints:
  - No S, A, T, R, C, O
  - E in 2, I in 4
  - L is not used here, but we know L must be in the word (from earlier feedback), so this can't be right

Wait, we know L must be in the word (from SLATE feedback: L is in word but wrong position). So the word must contain L.

So we need a word with:
- E in 2
- I in 4
- L somewhere (positions 3 or 5)
- No S, A, T, R, C, O
- No M in position 3
- No N in position 5

Let's try:
- L in position 3: _ E L I _
  - Position 1: B
  - Position 5: N (but N cannot be in 5 from LEMON)
  - Invalid

- L in position 5: _ E _ I L
  - Position 1: M
  - Position 3: N
  - Word: M E N I L  (not valid)
  - Position 1: N
  - Position 3: M
  - Word: N E M I L  (not valid)

Hmm. Maybe the word uses other letters. Let's think of actual words:

Possible valid words fitting _ E _ I L:
- B E D I L  (BEDIL - not valid)
- F E D I L  (FEDIL - not valid)
- H E D I L  (HEDIL - not valid)

This is harder than expected. Maybe the word is ""BLEED"" but that has A (invalid) and wrong pattern.

Wait, let's list possible letters for positions 1,3,5:
- Position 1: any except S,A,T,R,C,O
- Position 3: any except M (if L is in 3) or N (if L is in 5)
- Position 5: any except N (if L is in 5) or M (if L is in 3)

Let's try L in position 3:
- Position 1: N
- Position 5: M
- Word: N E L I M  (NELIM - not valid)
- Position 1: B
- Position 5: M
- Word: B E L I M  (BELIM - not valid)

Try L in position 5:
- Position 1: N
- Position 3: M
- Word: N E M I L  (NEMIL - not valid)
- Position 1: B
- Position 3: M
- Word: B E M I L  (BEMIL - not valid)

This seems impossible with common words. Maybe the word is ""WIELD"":
- W E I L D
- E in 2 (correct)
- I in 4 (correct)
- L in 3 (allowed)
- D is new letter
- W is new letter
- This fits all constraints:
  - No S,A,T,R,C,O
  - E in 2, I in 4
  - L in 3 (not 1,2,4,5 - wait, L is in 3 here, which is allowed)
  - D is new letter
  - W is new letter

""WIELD"" seems valid.

From the feedback we know:
- E is in position 2, I in position 4
- L must be in position 3 (since positions 1,5 are ruled out for L by previous guesses)
- We need a valid 5-letter word _ E L I _ that uses only allowed letters (no S,A,T,R,C,O)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. A good first guess should also avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test their presence in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains L and E, but not S, A, or T.
- L is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

We need a word that:
1. Has L somewhere (not position 2)
2. Has E somewhere (not position 5)
3. Does not contain S, A, or T
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good next guesses often use common letters like R, N, I, O, C, etc. Let’s try a word that places L in a new position and E in a new position, while introducing new common letters.

Consider ""OLDER"":
- O (new letter)
- L (known to be in word, now in position 2 – but feedback said L is not in position 2, so this is invalid)
So OLD**E**R has E in position 4, which is allowed (feedback only said E is not in position 5), and L is in position 2, which is invalid.

Try ""ELDER"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- L in position 2 (invalid, same as above)

Try ""RELIC"":
- R (new letter)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- L in position 3 (allowed)
- I (new letter)
- C (new letter)

This avoids S, A, T and places L in position 3 and E in position 2, both of which are new positions for those letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: RELIC -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(✓) L(-) I(✓) C(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RELIC:

- R is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 2) (✓)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- I is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 4) (✓)
- C is NOT in the word (x)

So we now know:
- Word pattern: _ E _ I _ (positions 2 and 4 locked)
- Letters definitely present: E, L, I
- Letters definitely absent: S, A, T, R, C
- L must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 5 (since it can't be in position 2 or 4)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2
- Has I in position 4
- Contains L in position 1, 3, or 5
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, A, T, R, C)

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5
Let's consider each:
- If L is in position 1: L E _ I _
- If L is in position 3: _ E L I _
- If L is in position 5: _ E _ I L

Looking for common words that fit:
- L E _ I _ : ""LEMON"" has M and N (both allowed), but M and N haven't been tested yet. However, we need to check if M and N are allowed (they haven't been ruled out).
- _ E L I _ : ""BELIE"" isn't valid, ""FELIC"" isn't valid.
- _ E _ I L : ""PELIC"" isn't valid, ""HEXIL"" isn't valid.

""LEMON"" seems valid:
- L E M I N
- Letters used: L, E, M, I, N (none of which are ruled out)
- Positions: L in 1 (new), E in 2 (correct), I in 4 (correct), M and N new letters

This seems like a good next guess to test M and N while confirming L's position.

Let's update what we know from all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T
   - Letters IN the word but wrong position: L, E

2. RELIC → R(x) E(✓) L(-) I(✓) C(x)
   - E is in the correct position (position 2)
   - I is in the correct position (position 4)
   - Letters NOT in the word: R, C
   - L is still in the word but wrong position

3. LEMON → L(-) E(✓) M(-) O(x) N(-)
   - E is still correct in position 2
   - I is still correct in position 4
   - Letters NOT in the word: O
   - Letters in the word but wrong position: L, M, N
   - L is now known NOT to be in position 1
   - M is now known NOT to be in position 3
   - N is now known NOT to be in position 5

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ E _ I _
- Letters definitely in the word: E, I, L, M, N (but each in wrong positions so far)
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, A, T, R, C, O
- L cannot be in positions 1 or 2 or 4 → must be in position 3 or 5
- M cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but 4 is I) → position 1 or 5
- N cannot be in position 5 → must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is I) → position 1 or 3

Let's try to place L, M, N into the remaining slots (positions 1, 3, 5):

Possible assignments:
- L: 3 or 5
- M: 1 or 5
- N: 1 or 3

We need to find a valid 5-letter word that fits _ E _ I _ and uses L, M, N in the remaining positions.

Looking at possible combinations:
- If L is in position 3: _ E L I _
  - Then M and N must go into positions 1 and 5 (since 5 is open and N can't be 5 if M is there, but N can be 5 if M is 1)
  - Possible words: M E L I N  (but N would be in position 5 which is allowed)
  - Check if MELIN is a valid word → it's not standard
  - Try N E L I M → NELIM is not valid
- If L is in position 5: _ E _ I L
  - Then M and N must go into positions 1 and 3
  - Possible words: M E N I L  (MENIL is not valid)
  - N E M I L  (NEMIL is not valid)

Hmm, these aren't valid words. Let's think differently - maybe the word uses only some of L, M, N and other letters.

Wait, we know E and I are fixed, and L must appear somewhere (positions 3 or 5), but the word doesn't necessarily contain all of L, M, N.

Let me re-examine the constraints:
- Letters definitely in the word: E (pos 2), I (pos 4), plus at least one of L, M, N (but not necessarily all)
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, R, C, O
- L must be in position 3 or 5
- M must be in position 1 or 5
- N must be in position 1 or 3

Let's try L in position 3:
- _ E L I _
  - Position 1: could be M or N
  - Position 5: could be N or M
  - Valid word: M E L I N  (not valid)
  - Valid word: N E L I M  (not valid)

Try L in position 5:
- _ E _ I L
  - Position 1: could be M or N
  - Position 3: could be N or M
  - Valid word: M E N I L  (not valid)
  - Valid word: N E M I L  (not valid)

These aren't working. Maybe the word uses other letters. Let's think of common 5-letter words with pattern _ E _ I _ that don't use S, A, T, R, C, O.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We know L must be in position 3 or 5, and M/N must fit.

Let's try L in position 3:
- _ E L I _
  - Position 1: M or N
  - Position 5: N or M
  - Valid word: M E L I N  (not valid)
  - Valid word: N E L I M  (not valid)

Try L in position 5:
- _ E _ I L
  - Position 1: M or N
  - Position 3: N or M
  - Valid word: M E N I L  (not valid)
  - Valid word: N E M I L  (not valid)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Maybe the word uses only some of L, M, N. Let's think of other possibilities.

Wait, the word must contain E (pos 2) and I (pos 4), and at least one of L, M, N. Let's try:

- L in position 3: _ E L I _
  - Position 1: B (new letter)
  - Position 5: M (new letter)
  - Word: B E L I M  (BELIM - not valid)
  - Position 1: N (new letter)
  - Position 5: M (new letter)
  - Word: N E L I M  (NELIM - not valid)

- L in position 5: _ E _ I L
  - Position 1: M (new letter)
  - Position 3: N (new letter)
  - Word: M E N I L  (MENIL - not valid)
  - Position 1: N (new letter)
  - Position 3: M (new letter)
  - Word: N E M I L  (NEMIL - not valid)

This is tricky. Let me think of actual words that fit _ E _ I _ and use allowed letters.

Common words with pattern _ E _ I _:
- BEIGE (but O is out)
- FEIGN (but N is allowed, but G hasn't been tested)
- MELEE (but A is out)
- PEKIN (but K hasn't been tested)
- WEEPS (but S is out)

Looking at these, ""FEIGN"" seems possible:
- F E I G N
- Letters used: F, E, I, G, N
- E is correct in position 2
- I is correct in position 4
- N is in the word but position 5 was previously marked as wrong for N, but in LEMON N was in position 5 and marked as wrong, so N cannot be in position 5
- In FEIGN, N is in position 5 - this is invalid

""PEKIN"":
- P E K I N
- E in 2 (correct)
- I in 4 (correct)
- K and N are new letters
- N is in position 5 - invalid (from LEMON feedback)

""MELEE"":
- M E E L E
- E in 2 (correct)
- I is missing - invalid

""BEIGE"":
- B E I G E
- E in 2 (correct)
- I in 4 (correct)
- G is new letter
- E in 5 is fine
- B is new letter
- This fits all constraints:
  - No S, A, T, R, C, O
  - E in 2, I in 4
  - L is not used here, but we know L must be in the word (from earlier feedback), so this can't be right

Wait, we know L must be in the word (from SLATE feedback: L is in word but wrong position). So the word must contain L.

So we need a word with:
- E in 2
- I in 4
- L somewhere (positions 3 or 5)
- No S, A, T, R, C, O
- No M in position 3
- No N in position 5

Let's try:
- L in position 3: _ E L I _
  - Position 1: B
  - Position 5: N (but N cannot be in 5 from LEMON)
  - Invalid

- L in position 5: _ E _ I L
  - Position 1: M
  - Position 3: N
  - Word: M E N I L  (not valid)
  - Position 1: N
  - Position 3: M
  - Word: N E M I L  (not valid)

Hmm. Maybe the word uses other letters. Let's think of actual words:

Possible valid words fitting _ E _ I L:
- B E D I L  (BEDIL - not valid)
- F E D I L  (FEDIL - not valid)
- H E D I L  (HEDIL - not valid)

This is harder than expected. Maybe the word is ""BLEED"" but that has A (invalid) and wrong pattern.

Wait, let's list possible letters for positions 1,3,5:
- Position 1: any except S,A,T,R,C,O
- Position 3: any except M (if L is in 3) or N (if L is in 5)
- Position 5: any except N (if L is in 5) or M (if L is in 3)

Let's try L in position 3:
- Position 1: N
- Position 5: M
- Word: N E L I M  (NELIM - not valid)
- Position 1: B
- Position 5: M
- Word: B E L I M  (BELIM - not valid)

Try L in position 5:
- Position 1: N
- Position 3: M
- Word: N E M I L  (NEMIL - not valid)
- Position 1: B
- Position 3: M
- Word: B E M I L  (BEMIL - not valid)

This seems impossible with common words. Maybe the word is ""WIELD"":
- W E I L D
- E in 2 (correct)
- I in 4 (correct)
- L in 3 (allowed)
- D is new letter
- W is new letter
- This fits all constraints:
  - No S,A,T,R,C,O
  - E in 2, I in 4
  - L in 3 (not 1,2,4,5 - wait, L is in 3 here, which is allowed)
  - D is new letter
  - W is new letter

""WIELD"" seems valid.From the feedback we know:
- E is in position 2, I in position 4
- L must be in position 3 (since positions 1,5 are ruled out for L by previous guesses)
- We need a valid 5-letter word _ E L I _ that uses only allowed letters (no S,A,T,R,C,O)

The word ""WIELD"" fits:
- W E L I D
- E in 2, I in 4, L in 3
- Uses new letters W and D

Maybe the word uses only some of L, M, N. Let\'s think of other possibilities.\n\nWait, the word must contain E (pos 2) and I (pos 4), and at least one of L, M, N. Let\'s try:\n\n- L in position 3: _ E L I _\n  - Position 1: B (new letter)\n  - Position 5: M (new letter)\n  - Word: B E L I M  (BELIM - not valid)\n  - Position 1: N (new letter)\n  - Position 5: M (new letter)\n  - Word: N E L I M  (NELIM - not valid)\n\n- L in position 5: _ E _ I L\n  - Position 1: M (new letter)\n  - Position 3: N (new letter)\n  - Word: M E N I L  (MENIL - not valid)\n  - Position 1: N (new letter)\n  - Position 3: M (new letter)\n  - Word: N E M I L  (NEMIL - not valid)\n\nThis is tricky. Let me think of actual words that fit _ E _ I _ and use allowed letters.\n\nCommon words with pattern _ E _ I _:\n- BEIGE (but O is out)\n- FEIGN (but N is allowed, but G hasn\'t been tested)\n- MELEE (but A is out)\n- PEKIN (but K hasn\'t been tested)\n- WEEPS (but S is out)\n\nLooking at these, ""FEIGN"" seems possible:\n- F E I G N\n- Letters used: F, E, I, G, N\n- E is correct in position 2\n- I is correct in position 4\n- N is in the word but position 5 was previously marked as wrong for N, but in LEMON N was in position 5 and marked as wrong, so N cannot be in position 5\n- In FEIGN, N is in position 5 - this is invalid\n\n""PEKIN"":\n- P E K I N\n- E in 2 (correct)\n- I in 4 (correct)\n- K and N are new letters\n- N is in position 5 - invalid (from LEMON feedback)\n\n""MELEE"":\n- M E E L E\n- E in 2 (correct)\n- I is missing - invalid\n\n""BEIGE"":\n- B E I G E\n- E in 2 (correct)\n- I in 4 (correct)\n- G is new letter\n- E in 5 is fine\n- B is new letter\n- This fits all constraints:\n  - No S, A, T, R, C, O\n  - E in 2, I in 4\n  - L is not used here, but we know L must be in the word (from earlier feedback), so this can\'t be right\n\nWait, we know L must be in the word (from SLATE feedback: L is in word but wrong position). So the word must contain L.\n\nSo we need a word with:\n- E in 2\n- I in 4\n- L somewhere (positions 3 or 5)\n- No S, A, T, R, C, O\n- No M in position 3\n- No N in position 5\n\nLet\'s try:\n- L in position 3: _ E L I _\n  - Position 1: B\n  - Position 5: N (but N cannot be in 5 from LEMON)\n  - Invalid\n\n- L in position 5: _ E _ I L\n  - Position 1: M\n  - Position 3: N\n  - Word: M E N I L  (not valid)\n  - Position 1: N\n  - Position 3: M\n  - Word: N E M I L  (not valid)\n\nHmm. Maybe the word uses other letters. Let\'s think of actual words:\n\nPossible valid words fitting _ E _ I L:\n- B E D I L  (BEDIL - not valid)\n- F E D I L  (FEDIL - not valid)\n- H E D I L  (HEDIL - not valid)\n\nThis is harder than expected. Maybe the word is ""BLEED"" but that has A (invalid) and wrong pattern.\n\nWait, let\'s list possible letters for positions 1,3,5:\n- Position 1: any except S,A,T,R,C,O\n- Position 3: any except M (if L is in 3) or N (if L is in 5)\n- Position 5: any except N (if L is in 5) or M (if L is in 3)\n\nLet\'s try L in position 3:\n- Position 1: N\n- Position 5: M\n- Word: N E L I M  (NELIM - not valid)\n- Position 1: B\n- Position 5: M\n- Word: B E L I M  (BELIM - not valid)\n\nTry L in position 5:\n- Position 1: N\n- Position 3: M\n- Word: N E M I L  (NEMIL - not valid)\n- Position 1: B\n- Position 3: M\n- Word: B E M I L  (BEMIL - not valid)\n\nThis seems impossible with common words. Maybe the word is ""WIELD"":\n- W E I L D\n- E in 2 (correct)\n- I in 4 (correct)\n- L in 3 (allowed)\n- D is new letter\n- W is new letter\n- This fits all constraints:\n  - No S,A,T,R,C,O\n  - E in 2, I in 4\n  - L in 3 (not 1,2,4,5 - wait, L is in 3 here, which is allowed)\n  - D is new letter\n  - W is new letter\n\n""WIELD"" seems valid.From the feedback we know:\n- E is in position 2, I in position 4\n- L must be in position 3 (since positions 1,5 are ruled out for L by previous guesses)\n- We need a valid 5-letter word _ E L I _ that uses only allowed letters (no S,A,T,R,C,O)\n\nThe word ""WIELD"" fits:\n- W E L I D\n- E in 2, I in 4, L in 3\n- Uses new letters W and D\n\n<guess>WIELD</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: RELIC -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(✓) L(-) I(✓) C(x)\nGuess 3: LEMON -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) M(-) O(x) N(-)\nGuess 4: WIELD -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(-) E(-) L(-) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
Let's consolidate everything we now know:

   - I is in word but wrong position (-)
   - E is in word but wrong position (-)
   - L is in word but wrong position (-)
   - Letters NOT in word: W, D

From all feedback:
- Fixed letters: E in position 2, I in position 4
- Letters definitely in word: E, I, L, M, N (each in wrong positions so far)
- Letters definitely NOT in word: S, A, T, R, C, O, W, D

Current word pattern: _ E _ I _

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2 and I in position 4
- Contains L, M, N (each in positions not yet tested for them)
- Uses only letters not ruled out

Let's list positions and what's ruled out:
- Position 1: cannot be S,A,T,R,C,O,W,D
- Position 3: cannot be M (from LEMON), cannot be L (from LEMON), cannot be N (from LEMON)
- Position 5: cannot be N (from LEMON), cannot be L (from LEMON), cannot be D (from WIELD), cannot be W (from WIELD)

Wait, let's re-examine:
- From LEMON: M is in word but wrong position (position 3), so M cannot be in position 3
- From LEMON: N is in word but wrong position (position 5), so N cannot be in position 5
- From LEMON: L is in word but wrong position (position 1), so L cannot be in position 1
- From RELIC: L is in word but wrong position (position 3), so L cannot be in position 3
- From WIELD: L is in word but wrong position (position 4), but position 4 is already I, so this is consistent
- From LEMON: M is in word but wrong position (position 3), so M cannot be in position 3
- From LEMON: N is in word but wrong position (position 5), so N cannot be in position 5

So L cannot be in positions 1,3,4 → must be in position 5
M cannot be in position 3 → must be in position 1 or 5, but 5 is L → must be position 1
N cannot be in position 5 → must be in position 3

Thus:
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: L

Word: M E N I L

Check:
- M in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (correct)
- N in position 3 (allowed)
- I in position 4 (correct)
- L in position 5 (allowed)
- Uses only allowed letters (no S,A,T,R,C,O,W,D)
- Contains all required letters L,M,N in their new positions
