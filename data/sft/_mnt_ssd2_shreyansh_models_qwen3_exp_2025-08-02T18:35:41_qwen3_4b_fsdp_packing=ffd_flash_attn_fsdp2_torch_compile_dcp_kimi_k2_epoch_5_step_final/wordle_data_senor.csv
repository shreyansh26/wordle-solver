For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should contain frequently used vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess would use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x): A is not in the word at all.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains R, O, S, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively).
- The word does NOT contain A.

We need a new 5-letter word that uses R, O, S, E in different positions and avoids A. Also, since E is not in the 5th position, we need to place it elsewhere.

Possible positions for R, O, S, E:
- R cannot be in position 2.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

Let's try to place these letters in new positions while introducing a new consonant. A good candidate is ""STORE"":
- S in position 1 (new position)
- T (new letter)
- O in position 3 (was position 3 before, but feedback said O is in the word but not in position 3, so this is invalid)

Oops, O cannot be in position 3. Let's try ""ROSES"":
- R in position 1 (new position)
- O in position 2 (new position)
- S in position 3 (new position)
- E in position 4 (new position)
- S in position 5 (repeats S, but that's allowed)

This uses all known letters in new positions and introduces no new constraints. However, it repeats S which might not be optimal. Let's try ""ROSES"" first.

But wait, ""ROSES"" has S in positions 3 and 5. Let me see if that's acceptable - yes, duplicates are allowed. However, we might want to avoid duplicates for now. Let's try ""REPOS"":
- R in position 1 (new position)
- E in position 2 (new position)
- P (new letter)
- O in position 4 (new position)
- S in position 5 (new position)

This uses all known letters in new positions and introduces P. This seems better.

Let me verify positions:
- R is in position 1 (was position 2, so this is allowed)
- E is in position 2 (was position 5, so this is allowed)
- O is in position 4 (was position 3, so this is allowed)
- S is in position 5 (was position 4, so this is allowed)
- P is new, so it's okay

This seems like a good next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
- Letters known to be in the word: R, O, S, E
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A
- Position constraints so far:
  – R is not in position 2 (from arose)
  – O is not in position 3 (from arose)
  – S is not in position 4 (from arose)
  – E is not in position 5 (from arose)

Round 2: repos → R(-) E(✓) P(x) O(✓) S(-)
- E is now confirmed in position 2.
- O is confirmed in position 4.
- R is still in the word but not in positions 2 or 1 (from repos).
- S is still in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (from arose and repos).
- P is not in the word.

So we now know:
- E is fixed in position 2.
- O is fixed in position 4.
- R must be in positions 3 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 2).
- S must be in position 1 or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5).
- Remaining positions to fill: 1, 3, 5 with letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

Possible patterns:
- Position 1: S or new letter
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 3: R or S or new letter
- Position 4: O (fixed)
- Position 5: R or S or new letter

Let’s list possible combinations:

1. S _ R O _ → positions 1,3,5: S, R, ?  
   But S cannot be in position 5 (from arose), and R cannot be in position 5 (from repos), so this would require a new letter in position 5.  
   Word: S E R O ? → need a valid 5-letter word ending in ?.

   Possible word: S E R O T → “serot” – not valid.  
   SERON – not valid.  
   SEROS – not valid.  
   SEROU – not valid.  
   No obvious valid word here.

2. _ E R O S → positions 1,3,5: ?, R, S  
   R in position 3 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed).  
   Need a valid word like ? E R O S.  
   Valid word: “HEROS” – but H is new and allowed.  
   “HEROS” is valid.

3. S E S O R → S in 1, S in 3 (invalid – duplicate S not ruled out, but let’s see if word exists).  
   “SESOR” – not valid.

4. _ E S O R → positions 1,3,5: ?, S, R  
   S in position 3 (allowed), R in position 5 (allowed).  
   Need a valid word like ? E S O R.  
   Valid word: “MESOR” – not common.  
   “DESOR” – not valid.  
   “LESOR” – not valid.  
   “PESOR” – P is already ruled out.

5. R E S O S – but R cannot be in position 1 (from repos), so invalid.

6. R E S O R – R in position 1 is invalid.

7. S E _ O R – S in 1, ? in 3, R in 5.  
   Need a valid word like S E ? O R.  
   Valid word: “SEGOR” – not valid.  
   “SEPOR” – P is invalid.  
   “SEBOR” – not valid.

8. _ E _ O R – need to place S and R in positions 1 and 3.  
   R cannot be in 1 (from repos), so S must be in 1 and R in 3.  
   Word: S E R O R – “SEROR” – not valid.

The only valid word that fits all constraints is “HEROS”.

Let me double-check:
- H is new, allowed.
- E in position 2 (✓ from repos).
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R cannot be in 1 or 2).
- O in position 4 (✓ from repos).
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S cannot be in 4 or 5? Wait – S cannot be in 5 (from arose: S(-) means S is in word but not in position 4, but position 5 is not excluded). Actually, arose feedback says S is in word but not in position 4. repos says S is in word but not in position 5. So S must be in 1, 2, or 3. In “HEROS”, S is in 5 – which is invalid because arose says S is not in 4, but does not say anything about 5. However, repos says S is not in 5. So S cannot be in 4 or 5, so must be in 1 or 2 or 3. In “HEROS”, S is in 5 – which is invalid. So “HEROS” is invalid.

Back to square one.

Let me re-examine S constraints:
- arose: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 4.
- repos: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 5.
So S must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Current known:
- E is fixed in position 2.
- O is fixed in position 4.
- R must be in position 3 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 2).
- S must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (but 2 is E), so 1 or 3.

Let’s try:
- S in position 1, R in position 3: S E R O ?  
   Need a letter for position 5, but R cannot be in 5 (from repos), and S cannot be in 5, so position 5 must be new letter.  
   Possible word: S E R O ? – need valid word.  
   SEROT – not valid.  
   SERON – not valid.  
   SEROW – not valid.

- R in position 5, S in position 1: S E _ O R  
   Need letter in position 3.  
   Valid word: S E L O R – “selor” – not valid.  
   S E G O R – “segor” – not valid.  
   S E D O R – “sedor” – not valid.  
   S E T O R – “setor” – not valid.  
   S E N O R – “senor” – valid.

“SENO R” – “SENO R” is valid.

Check constraints:
- S in 1 (allowed)
- E in 2 (✓)
- N new, allowed
- O in 4 (✓)
- R in 5 (allowed)

This fits all constraints.

Another possibility: S in position 3, R in position 5: _ E S O R  
Need position 1: valid word ? E S O R.  
Valid word: “MESOR” – not common.  
“DESOR” – not valid.  
“LESOR” – not valid.  
“PESOR” – P invalid.  
“HECTOR” – too long.  
No obvious valid word.

Thus, “SENO R” seems the best valid option.

But wait, “SENO R” is 6 letters. I need 5.

Realize I wrote “SENO R” which is 6. Need 5-letter word.

Corrected: “SENO R” is invalid. Need 5-letter.

Let me re-examine: S E _ O R – need 5-letter word.

Valid word: “SEPOR” – P invalid.  
“SEGOR” – G is allowed, but “SEGOR” is not a common word.  
“SEGOR” is actually a valid word (a type of bird), but let me check if it fits.

“SEGOR”:
- S in 1 (allowed)
- E in 2 (✓)
- G new, allowed
- O in 4 (✓)
- R in 5 (allowed)

This fits all constraints.

Another valid word: “SEROS” – but R in 5 and S in 3: S E R O S – but S cannot be in 5 (from repos), and this has S in 5 – invalid.

“SERUM” – but U is new, and we need O in 4 – invalid.

“SERFS” – but O is required in 4 – invalid.

“SERGE” – but E is in 2, so 5th would be E – but E is already in 2 – invalid.

Thus, the valid 5-letter words that fit are “SEGOR” and possibly others, but “SEGOR” is the most fitting.

However, let me think of another approach: since we have E in 2 and O in 4, and need R and S in 1,3,5 with constraints.

Let me list possible positions:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   ? E ? O ?

Constraints:
- R must be in 3 or 5
- S must be in 1 or 3 (since 2 is E)
- P is out, A is out

Case 1: S in 1, R in 3
Word: S E R O ?
Need letter for 5, but R cannot be in 5 (from repos), and S cannot be in 5, so position 5 must be new letter.  
Valid word: S E R O T – “SEROT” – not valid.

Case 2: S in 1, R in 5
Word: S E _ O R
Need letter in 3.  
Valid word: S E L O R – “selor” – not valid.  
S E G O R – “segor” – not valid.  
S E D O R – “sedor” – not valid.  
S E T O R – “setor” – not valid.  
S E N O R – “senor” – valid (Spanish for “sir”, but accepted in English word lists).

“SENO R” is 5 letters: S E N O R – yes, that’s 5.

Check constraints:
- S in 1 (allowed)
- E in 2 (✓)
- N new, allowed
- O in 4 (✓)
- R in 5 (allowed)

This fits perfectly.

Thus, the next guess is “SENO R”.

<guess>senor</guess>",senor,"From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
- Letters known to be in the word: R, O, S, E
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A
- Position constraints so far:
  – R is not in position 2 (from arose)
  – O is not in position 3 (from arose)
  – S is not in position 4 (from arose)
  – E is not in position 5 (from arose)

Round 2: repos → R(-) E(✓) P(x) O(✓) S(-)
- E is now confirmed in position 2.
- O is confirmed in position 4.
- R is still in the word but not in positions 2 or 1 (from repos).
- S is still in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (from arose and repos).
- P is not in the word.

So we now know:
- E is fixed in position 2.
- O is fixed in position 4.
- R must be in positions 3 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 2).
- S must be in position 1 or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5).
- Remaining positions to fill: 1, 3, 5 with letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

Possible patterns:
- Position 1: S or new letter
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 3: R or S or new letter
- Position 4: O (fixed)
- Position 5: R or S or new letter

Let’s list possible combinations:

1. S _ R O _ → positions 1,3,5: S, R, ?  
   But S cannot be in position 5 (from arose), and R cannot be in position 5 (from repos), so this would require a new letter in position 5.  
   Word: S E R O ? → need a valid 5-letter word ending in ?.

   Possible word: S E R O T → “serot” – not valid.  
   SERON – not valid.  
   SEROS – not valid.  
   SEROU – not valid.  
   No obvious valid word here.

2. _ E R O S → positions 1,3,5: ?, R, S  
   R in position 3 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed).  
   Need a valid word like ? E R O S.  
   Valid word: “HEROS” – but H is new and allowed.  
   “HEROS” is valid.

3. S E S O R → S in 1, S in 3 (invalid – duplicate S not ruled out, but let’s see if word exists).  
   “SESOR” – not valid.

4. _ E S O R → positions 1,3,5: ?, S, R  
   S in position 3 (allowed), R in position 5 (allowed).  
   Need a valid word like ? E S O R.  
   Valid word: “MESOR” – not common.  
   “DESOR” – not valid.  
   “LESOR” – not valid.  
   “PESOR” – P is already ruled out.

5. R E S O S – but R cannot be in position 1 (from repos), so invalid.

6. R E S O R – R in position 1 is invalid.

7. S E _ O R – S in 1, ? in 3, R in 5.  
   Need a valid word like S E ? O R.  
   Valid word: “SEGOR” – not valid.  
   “SEPOR” – P is invalid.  
   “SEBOR” – not valid.

8. _ E _ O R – need to place S and R in positions 1 and 3.  
   R cannot be in 1 (from repos), so S must be in 1 and R in 3.  
   Word: S E R O R – “SEROR” – not valid.

The only valid word that fits all constraints is “HEROS”.

Let me double-check:
- H is new, allowed.
- E in position 2 (✓ from repos).
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R cannot be in 1 or 2).
- O in position 4 (✓ from repos).
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S cannot be in 4 or 5? Wait – S cannot be in 5 (from arose: S(-) means S is in word but not in position 4, but position 5 is not excluded). Actually, arose feedback says S is in word but not in position 4. repos says S is in word but not in position 5. So S must be in 1, 2, or 3. In “HEROS”, S is in 5 – which is invalid because arose says S is not in 4, but does not say anything about 5. However, repos says S is not in 5. So S cannot be in 4 or 5, so must be in 1 or 2 or 3. In “HEROS”, S is in 5 – which is invalid. So “HEROS” is invalid.

Back to square one.

Let me re-examine S constraints:
- arose: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 4.
- repos: S(-) → S is in word but not in position 5.
So S must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Current known:
- E is fixed in position 2.
- O is fixed in position 4.
- R must be in position 3 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 2).
- S must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (but 2 is E), so 1 or 3.

Let’s try:
- S in position 1, R in position 3: S E R O ?  
   Need a letter for position 5, but R cannot be in 5 (from repos), and S cannot be in 5, so position 5 must be new letter.  
   Possible word: S E R O ? – need valid word.  
   SEROT – not valid.  
   SERON – not valid.  
   SEROW – not valid.

- R in position 5, S in position 1: S E _ O R  
   Need letter in position 3.  
   Valid word: S E L O R – “selor” – not valid.  
   S E G O R – “segor” – not valid.  
   S E D O R – “sedor” – not valid.  
   S E T O R – “setor” – not valid.  
   S E N O R – “senor” – valid.

“SENO R” – “SENO R” is valid.

Check constraints:
- S in 1 (allowed)
- E in 2 (✓)
- N new, allowed
- O in 4 (✓)
- R in 5 (allowed)

This fits all constraints.

Another possibility: S in position 3, R in position 5: _ E S O R  
Need position 1: valid word ? E S O R.  
Valid word: “MESOR” – not common.  
“DESOR” – not valid.  
“LESOR” – not valid.  
“PESOR” – P invalid.  
“HECTOR” – too long.  
No obvious valid word.

Thus, “SENO R” seems the best valid option.

But wait, “SENO R” is 6 letters. I need 5.

Realize I wrote “SENO R” which is 6. Need 5-letter word.

Corrected: “SENO R” is invalid. Need 5-letter.

Let me re-examine: S E _ O R – need 5-letter word.

Valid word: “SEPOR” – P invalid.  
“SEGOR” – G is allowed, but “SEGOR” is not a common word.  
“SEGOR” is actually a valid word (a type of bird), but let me check if it fits.

“SEGOR”:
- S in 1 (allowed)
- E in 2 (✓)
- G new, allowed
- O in 4 (✓)
- R in 5 (allowed)

This fits all constraints.

Another valid word: “SEROS” – but R in 5 and S in 3: S E R O S – but S cannot be in 5 (from repos), and this has S in 5 – invalid.

“SERUM” – but U is new, and we need O in 4 – invalid.

“SERFS” – but O is required in 4 – invalid.

“SERGE” – but E is in 2, so 5th would be E – but E is already in 2 – invalid.

Case 1: S in 1, R in 3
Word: S E R O ?
Need letter for 5, but R cannot be in 5 (from repos), and S cannot be in 5, so position 5 must be new letter.  
Valid word: S E R O T – “SEROT” – not valid.

Case 2: S in 1, R in 5
Word: S E _ O R
Need letter in 3.  
Valid word: S E L O R – “selor” – not valid.  
S E G O R – “segor” – not valid.  
S E D O R – “sedor” – not valid.  
S E T O R – “setor” – not valid.

- R in 5 (allowed)

This fits perfectly.
