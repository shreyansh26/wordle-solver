For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters. ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and provides good coverage for vowels and common consonants. This should give us strong initial feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, S, E, P, I, N

Letters that ARE in the word:
- O (and it is in the correct position 2)
- T (but it is in the wrong position)

So the pattern so far is:
_ O _ _ _

and the word must contain T somewhere other than position 5.

Remaining unused common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, plus the vowels U and possibly another O (but O is already placed once).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Contains T somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Good candidates:
- B O T _ _ → ""botch"", ""botan"" (invalid), ""bottle"" (5 letters, but has E)
- C O T _ _ → ""copter"" (6 letters), ""cotton"" (6 letters), ""cotter"" (6 letters)
- D O T _ _ → ""dotter"" (6 letters), ""dotcom"" (5 letters, but has C and M)
- F O T _ _ → ""fotter"" (invalid)
- G O T _ _ → ""gotcha"" (6 letters), ""gotten"" (6 letters)
- H O T _ _ → ""hotdog"", ""hotter"", ""hotter"" (but T is already in position 3)

- V O T _ _ → ""voted"" (but E is out)
- W O T _ _ → ""wotan"" (invalid)

Best valid 5-letter words:

Between ""hotdog"" and ""botch"", ""botch"" uses more common letters (B, C, H) and places T in position 3, satisfying the requirement that T is not in position 5. This seems optimal for gathering more information.

So the next guess is ""botch"".

2. Letters that are in the word but in the wrong place:

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   A, R, S, E, P, I, N, B, C.

4. Pattern so far: _ O _ _ H

6. Possible words fitting _ O _ _ H with T in position 1 or 4:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters. ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and provides good coverage for vowels and common consonants. This should give us strong initial feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains the letter O, but it is NOT in position 3.
- The letters A, R, S, E are NOT in the word at all.
- We still have 21 letters (excluding A, R, S, E) to consider.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses the letter O (but not in position 3).
2. Does NOT use A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, U, I, O (already used).

Let’s pick a word that includes O in a different position and uses other common letters. ""POINT"" is a good candidate:
- P, O, I, N, T are all common letters.
- O is in position 2 (not 3), satisfying the feedback.
- None of A, R, S, E are used.

This should give us more information about P, I, N, T and confirm or deny the placement of O in position 2.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, S, E, P, I, N

Letters that ARE in the word:
- O (and it is in the correct position 2)
- T (but it is in the wrong position)

So the pattern so far is:
_ O _ _ _

and the word must contain T somewhere other than position 5.

Remaining unused common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, plus the vowels U and possibly another O (but O is already placed once).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Contains T somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Good candidates:
- B O T _ _ → ""botch"", ""botan"" (invalid), ""bottle"" (5 letters, but has E)
- C O T _ _ → ""copter"" (6 letters), ""cotton"" (6 letters), ""cotter"" (6 letters)
- D O T _ _ → ""dotter"" (6 letters), ""dotcom"" (5 letters, but has C and M)
- F O T _ _ → ""fotter"" (invalid)
- G O T _ _ → ""gotcha"" (6 letters), ""gotten"" (6 letters)
- H O T _ _ → ""hotdog"", ""hotter"", ""hotter"" (but T is already in position 3)
- L O T _ _ → ""lotter"" (6 letters)
- M O T _ _ → ""motif"" (but I is out), ""motor"" (but R is out)
- V O T _ _ → ""voted"" (but E is out)
- W O T _ _ → ""wotan"" (invalid)
- Y O T _ _ → ""yottas"" (invalid)

Best valid 5-letter words:
- ""hotter"" – but T is in position 5 (invalid)
- ""hotdog"" – valid, uses H, O, T, D, G
- ""gotcha"" – invalid (6 letters)
- ""dotter"" – invalid (6 letters)
- ""bottle"" – invalid (E is out)
- ""botch"" – valid, uses B, O, T, C, H

Between ""hotdog"" and ""botch"", ""botch"" uses more common letters (B, C, H) and places T in position 3, satisfying the requirement that T is not in position 5. This seems optimal for gathering more information.

So the next guess is ""botch"".

From the four rounds we now have:

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 2: O (✓)
   - Position 5: H (✓)

2. Letters that are in the word but in the wrong place:
   - T (must appear exactly once, and cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 because:
        - position 1: tried in ""tough"" and got (-)  
        - position 3: tried in ""botch"" and got (-)  
        - position 4: tried in ""tough"" and got (-)  
        - position 5: already fixed as H
        Therefore T must be in position 2, but position 2 is O. This is a contradiction.)

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback for ""tough"":
T(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(✓)

This means:
- T is in the word but not in position 1.
- O is correctly placed in position 2.
- U is not in the word.
- G is not in the word.
- H is correctly placed in position 5.

So the word has the pattern: _ O _ _ H
Letters known to be in the word: O (pos 2), H (pos 5), T (somewhere, but not pos 1).
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, B, C, U, G.

Remaining unused consonants: D, F, K, L, M, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: none left (A, E, I, U are out, O is fixed)

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ O _ _ H that contains T and uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for T:
- position 3 or 4 (cannot be 1 or 2 or 5)

Let's list possible words:
- _ O T _ H: ""dotch"" (C out), ""fotch"" (invalid), ""lotty"" (invalid), ""motty"" (invalid), ""wotty"" (invalid)
- _ O _ T H: ""dorthy"" (invalid), ""lotty"" (invalid), ""motty"" (invalid), ""worthy"" (invalid), ""yotty"" (invalid)

Looking at remaining letters, the only common word that fits is ""dorthy"" but that's 6 letters. 

Wait, let's try ""dorthy"" - no, that's 6 letters. 

Looking again: ""dorthy"" is invalid. 

Actually, ""dorthy"" is not a valid 5-letter word. 

But ""dorthy"" is not valid. 

Let me think differently: the pattern is _ O _ _ H with T in position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- ""dorthy"" - invalid
- ""lotty"" - invalid
- ""motty"" - invalid
- ""wotty"" - invalid
- ""fotter"" - invalid
- ""kotter"" - invalid
- ""yotter"" - invalid

Hmm, seems like there are no common words left. 

Wait, let's check ""dorthy"" - no, that's 6 letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters. ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and provides good coverage for vowels and common consonants. This should give us strong initial feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains the letter O, but it is NOT in position 3.
- The letters A, R, S, E are NOT in the word at all.
- We still have 21 letters (excluding A, R, S, E) to consider.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses the letter O (but not in position 3).
2. Does NOT use A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, K, V, W, U, I, O (already used).

Let’s pick a word that includes O in a different position and uses other common letters. ""POINT"" is a good candidate:
- P, O, I, N, T are all common letters.
- O is in position 2 (not 3), satisfying the feedback.
- None of A, R, S, E are used.

This should give us more information about P, I, N, T and confirm or deny the placement of O in position 2.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, S, E, P, I, N

Letters that ARE in the word:
- O (and it is in the correct position 2)
- T (but it is in the wrong position)

So the pattern so far is:
_ O _ _ _

and the word must contain T somewhere other than position 5.

Remaining unused common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, plus the vowels U and possibly another O (but O is already placed once).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Contains T somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Good candidates:
- B O T _ _ → ""botch"", ""botan"" (invalid), ""bottle"" (5 letters, but has E)
- C O T _ _ → ""copter"" (6 letters), ""cotton"" (6 letters), ""cotter"" (6 letters)
- D O T _ _ → ""dotter"" (6 letters), ""dotcom"" (5 letters, but has C and M)
- F O T _ _ → ""fotter"" (invalid)
- G O T _ _ → ""gotcha"" (6 letters), ""gotten"" (6 letters)
- H O T _ _ → ""hotdog"", ""hotter"", ""hotter"" (but T is already in position 3)
- L O T _ _ → ""lotter"" (6 letters)
- M O T _ _ → ""motif"" (but I is out), ""motor"" (but R is out)
- V O T _ _ → ""voted"" (but E is out)
- W O T _ _ → ""wotan"" (invalid)
- Y O T _ _ → ""yottas"" (invalid)

Best valid 5-letter words:
- ""hotter"" – but T is in position 5 (invalid)
- ""hotdog"" – valid, uses H, O, T, D, G
- ""gotcha"" – invalid (6 letters)
- ""dotter"" – invalid (6 letters)
- ""bottle"" – invalid (E is out)
- ""botch"" – valid, uses B, O, T, C, H

Between ""hotdog"" and ""botch"", ""botch"" uses more common letters (B, C, H) and places T in position 3, satisfying the requirement that T is not in position 5. This seems optimal for gathering more information.

So the next guess is ""botch"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 2 is O (✓).
   - Position 5 is H (✓).

2. Letters that are in the word but in the wrong place:
   - T (currently in position 3, so it must be in 1 or 4).

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   A, R, S, E, P, I, N, B, C.

4. Pattern so far: _ O _ _ H  
   and T must appear somewhere in positions 1 or 4.

5. Remaining unused common consonants: D, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y  
   Remaining unused vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are ruled out or fixed)

6. Possible words fitting _ O _ _ H with T in position 1 or 4:

   - T O _ _ H → “tough” (U and G still allowed), “tobeh” (invalid), “tolar” (R out), “tough” is valid.
   - _ O _ T H → “dorthy” (invalid), “lotty” (invalid), “motty” (invalid), “gorthy” (invalid), “worthy” (invalid), “vorthy” (invalid), “forthy” (invalid), “korthy” (invalid), “yorthy” (invalid).  
     The only valid common word here is “tough” (T O U G H).

   - Checking T in position 1: T O U G H → all letters are still allowed and fit the pattern.

   - Checking T in position 4: _ O _ T H → no common 5-letter word fits this with remaining letters.

Therefore, the only valid guess is “tough”.
