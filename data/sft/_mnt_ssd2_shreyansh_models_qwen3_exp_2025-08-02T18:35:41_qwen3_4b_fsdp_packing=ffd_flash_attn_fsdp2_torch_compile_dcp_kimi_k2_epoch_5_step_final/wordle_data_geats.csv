### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can get. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices for this reason. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help eliminate many words quickly.

Let’s consolidate what we know after both guesses.

Letters we know are in the word (but positions unknown):
- A (not in positions 1, 4)
- S (not in positions 3, 4)
- E (not in positions 3, 5)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- R, O, L, T

So the secret word must contain A, S, E and may not contain R, O, L, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, S, E exactly once each
- Uses two other letters (not R, O, L, T)
- Places A, S, E in allowed positions

Possible consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s pick a word that introduces new consonants while respecting the constraints. A good candidate is “SPEAK”:
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- P (new consonant)
- E (position 3 – allowed)
- A (position 4 – allowed)
- K (new consonant)

None of the letters are R, O, L, T, and we’ve placed A, S, E in allowed positions.

So the secret word must contain A, S, E exactly once each and two other letters chosen only from the remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place A, S, E in positions that have not been ruled out yet.

Allowed positions:
- A: 2, 3, 5
- S: 1, 2, 5
- E: 1, 2, 4

Let’s try to construct a valid word. A good next guess should introduce two new consonants and place A, S, E in allowed positions.

Consider the word “SNAKE”:
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- N (new consonant)
- A (position 3 – allowed)
- K (but K is already ruled out) → invalid

Next candidate: “SEAM” (but only 4 letters) → invalid.

Next: “EASES” (invalid, repeats E and S).

Next: “CASES” (invalid, repeats S).

Next: “SABLE”:
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- A (position 2 – allowed)
- B (new consonant)
- L (but L is ruled out) → invalid

Next: “SAVVE” (invalid, repeats V and E).

Next: “SANDY”:
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- A (position 2 – allowed)
- N (new consonant)
- D (new consonant)
- Y (new consonant)

But we need to check if all letters are allowed: S, A, N, D, Y. N, D, Y are not ruled out, and positions:
- A is in 2 (allowed)
- S is in 1 (allowed)
- E is missing → invalid (must contain E)

We must include E. So we need a word with A, S, E and two new consonants.

Consider “SHELF”:
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- H (new consonant)
- E (position 3 – allowed)
- L (but L is ruled out) → invalid

Next: “SHEEN”:
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- H (new consonant)
- E (position 3 – allowed)
- E (but E is already used) → invalid

Next: “SHEAR” (but R is ruled out) → invalid

Next: “SHEAL” (but L is ruled out) → invalid

Next: “SEAM” (only 4 letters) → invalid

Next: “SEAMY” (5 letters):
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- E (position 2 – allowed)
- A (position 3 – allowed)
- M (new consonant)
- Y (new consonant)

Check letters: S, E, A, M, Y. All allowed, positions:
- A is in 3 (allowed)
- S is in 1 (allowed)
- E is in 2 (allowed)

This seems valid.

But let’s check if “SEAMY” is a valid 5-letter English word. Yes, it means “shameful” or “disgraceful” and is listed in many dictionaries.

So “SEAMY” is a good next guess.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can get. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices for this reason. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help eliminate many words quickly.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- R is NOT in the word
- O is NOT the word
- S is in the word but not in position 4
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O
- Letters definitely in the word: A, S, E
- Positions to avoid for A: 1
- Positions to avoid for S: 4
- Positions to avoid for E: 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, S, E
- Does NOT contain R or O
- A is not in position 1
- S is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5

A good next guess should test new consonants and positions. ""STEAL"" comes to mind because it uses S, T, E, A, L - none of which are R or O. It also keeps S away from position 4 and E away from position 5.

Let’s consolidate what we know after both guesses.

Letters we know are in the word (but positions unknown):
- A (not in positions 1, 4)
- S (not in positions 3, 4)
- E (not in positions 3, 5)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- R, O, L, T

So the secret word must contain A, S, E and may not contain R, O, L, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, S, E exactly once each
- Uses two other letters (not R, O, L, T)
- Places A, S, E in allowed positions

Possible consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s pick a word that introduces new consonants while respecting the constraints. A good candidate is “SPEAK”:
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- P (new consonant)
- E (position 3 – allowed)
- A (position 4 – allowed)
- K (new consonant)

None of the letters are R, O, L, T, and we’ve placed A, S, E in allowed positions.

Consider the word “SNAKE”:

Next: “SAVVE” (invalid, repeats V and E).

Next: “SANDY”:
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- A (position 2 – allowed)
- N (new consonant)
- D (new consonant)
- Y (new consonant)

But we need to check if all letters are allowed: S, A, N, D, Y. N, D, Y are not ruled out, and positions:
- A is in 2 (allowed)
- S is in 1 (allowed)
- E is missing → invalid (must contain E)

We must include E. So we need a word with A, S, E and two new consonants.

Consider “SHELF”:
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- H (new consonant)
- E (position 3 – allowed)
- L (but L is ruled out) → invalid

Next: “SHEEN”:
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- H (new consonant)
- E (position 3 – allowed)
- E (but E is already used) → invalid

Next: “SHEAR” (but R is ruled out) → invalid

Next: “SHEAL” (but L is ruled out) → invalid

Next: “SEAM” (only 4 letters) → invalid

Next: “SEAMY” (5 letters):
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- E (position 2 – allowed)
- A (position 3 – allowed)
- M (new consonant)
- Y (new consonant)

Check letters: S, E, A, M, Y. All allowed, positions:
- A is in 3 (allowed)
- S is in 1 (allowed)
- E is in 2 (allowed)

This seems valid.

But let’s check if “SEAMY” is a valid 5-letter English word. Yes, it means “shameful” or “disgraceful” and is listed in many dictionaries.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can get. A good strategy is to pick a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly narrow down possibilities. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices for this reason. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help eliminate many words quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- R is NOT in the word
- O is NOT the word
- S is in the word but not in position 4
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O
- Letters definitely in the word: A, S, E
- Positions to avoid for A: 1
- Positions to avoid for S: 4
- Positions to avoid for E: 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, S, E
- Does NOT contain R or O
- A is not in position 1
- S is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5

A good next guess should test new consonants and positions. ""STEAL"" comes to mind because it uses S, T, E, A, L - none of which are R or O. It also keeps S away from position 4 and E away from position 5.

Let’s consolidate what we know after both guesses.

Letters we know are in the word (but positions unknown):
- A (not in positions 1, 4)
- S (not in positions 3, 4)
- E (not in positions 3, 5)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- R, O, L, T

So the secret word must contain A, S, E and may not contain R, O, L, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, S, E exactly once each
- Uses two other letters (not R, O, L, T)
- Places A, S, E in allowed positions

Possible consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s pick a word that introduces new consonants while respecting the constraints. A good candidate is “SPEAK”:
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- P (new consonant)
- E (position 3 – allowed)
- A (position 4 – allowed)
- K (new consonant)

None of the letters are R, O, L, T, and we’ve placed A, S, E in allowed positions.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are in the word (but positions still unknown):
- A (cannot be in positions 1, 4)
- S (cannot be in positions 3, 4)
- E (cannot be in positions 3, 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- R, O, L, T, P, K

So the secret word must contain A, S, E exactly once each and two other letters chosen only from the remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place A, S, E in positions that have not been ruled out yet.

Allowed positions:
- A: 2, 3, 5
- S: 1, 2, 5
- E: 1, 2, 4

Let’s try to construct a valid word. A good next guess should introduce two new consonants and place A, S, E in allowed positions.

Consider the word “SNAKE”:
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- N (new consonant)
- A (position 3 – allowed)
- K (but K is already ruled out) → invalid

Next candidate: “SEAM” (but only 4 letters) → invalid.

Next: “EASES” (invalid, repeats E and S).

Next: “CASES” (invalid, repeats S).

Next: “SABLE”:
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- A (position 2 – allowed)
- B (new consonant)
- L (but L is ruled out) → invalid

Next: “SAVVE” (invalid, repeats V and E).

Next: “SANDY”:
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- A (position 2 – allowed)
- N (new consonant)
- D (new consonant)
- Y (new consonant)

But we need to check if all letters are allowed: S, A, N, D, Y. N, D, Y are not ruled out, and positions:
- A is in 2 (allowed)
- S is in 1 (allowed)
- E is missing → invalid (must contain E)

We must include E. So we need a word with A, S, E and two new consonants.

Consider “SHELF”:
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- H (new consonant)
- E (position 3 – allowed)
- L (but L is ruled out) → invalid

Next: “SHEEN”:
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- H (new consonant)
- E (position 3 – allowed)
- E (but E is already used) → invalid

Next: “SHEAR” (but R is ruled out) → invalid

Next: “SHEAL” (but L is ruled out) → invalid

Next: “SEAM” (only 4 letters) → invalid

Next: “SEAMY” (5 letters):
- S (position 1 – allowed)
- E (position 2 – allowed)
- A (position 3 – allowed)
- M (new consonant)
- Y (new consonant)

Check letters: S, E, A, M, Y. All allowed, positions:
- A is in 3 (allowed)
- S is in 1 (allowed)
- E is in 2 (allowed)

This seems valid.

But let’s check if “SEAMY” is a valid 5-letter English word. Yes, it means “shameful” or “disgraceful” and is listed in many dictionaries.

So “SEAMY” is a good next guess.

From the feedback so far:

Letters we know are in the word:
- E in position 2 (✓)
- A in position 3 (✓)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
R, O, L, T, P, K, M, Y

Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
S (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 3, 4, or 1 from earlier feedback)

So S must be in position 2 or 5. However:
- Position 2 is already taken by E (✓), so S must be in position 5.

Therefore the word looks like: _ E A _ S

We need two more letters (positions 1 and 4) chosen only from the remaining unused consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, N, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need to pick two distinct consonants from this list and arrange them in positions 1 and 4.

Let’s list possible combinations:

Position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, N, Q, V, W, X, Z
Position 4: same list, different from position 1

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches the pattern C E A D S, C E A B S, etc.

Possible valid words:
- BEADS (B E A D S) – letters B, E, A, D, S. B and D are allowed.
- CEASE – but C is allowed, but E is already used in position 2 and cannot appear again in the same word (since we only have one E in the word). So CEASE is invalid.
- FEAST – but F is allowed, but T is already ruled out. So FEAST is invalid.
- GEARS – but G is allowed, but R is ruled out. So GEARS is invalid.
- HEAVS – not a valid word.
- LEADS – L is ruled out.
- NEATS – N is allowed, T is ruled out.
- WEARS – W is allowed, R is ruled out.
- BEADS seems valid: B E A D S. Letters B and D are not ruled out, and positions:
   - B (position 1) – allowed
   - E (position 2) – correct
   - A (position 3) – correct
   - D (position 4) – allowed
   - S (position 5) – allowed

Check if any other constraints are violated: no, B and D are new letters, and positions are all valid.

So BEADS is a good next guess.
