For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of letters that frequently appear in English words, helping to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible.\n\nLooking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common letter overall)\n\nThis gives us a good spread of letters that frequently appear in English words, helping to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S(x) – S is not in the word.\n- L(x) – L is not in the word.\n- A(x) – A is not in the word.\n- T(x) – T is not in the word.\n- E(-) – E is in the word, but not in the 5th position.\n\nSo we know:\n- The word contains E, but E is not the last letter.\n- The word does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.\n\nWe now need a 5-letter word that:\n1.

Does NOT have S, L, A, T.\n\nGood letters to try next: R, N, I, O, U, C, D, P, M, etc.\n\nLet’s pick a word that uses common consonants and vowels we haven’t ruled out. “CRONE” is a good candidate:\n- C, R, O, N, E.\n- E is in position 4 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.\n- C, R, O, N are all new letters we haven’t tested yet.\n\nThis should give us more information about these new letters while respecting the constraints.\n\n<guess>CRONE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(x) N(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on CRONE:\n- C(x) – C is not in the word.\n- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- O(x) – O is not in the word.\n- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E(-) – E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.\n\nSo far we know:\n- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, O.\n- Letters definitely IN the word: R, N, E.\n- Positions ruled out for these letters:\n  – R cannot be in position 2.\n  – N cannot be in position 4.\n  – E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.\n\nWe still need to test new consonants and vowels.

Let's update what we now know after UNDER:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, O, U, D  
Letters definitely IN the word: N, E, R  
Positions ruled out:
- N cannot be in position 2 (it is correct in position 2 here, so that’s the only placement we’ve seen so far for N).
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (it was wrong there in UNDER and CRONE).
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (it was wrong there in CRONE and UNDER).

So far the word looks like: _ N _ _ _  
E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (but 2 is N, so 1 or 3).  
R must appear somewhere except positions 2 or 5, so positions 1, 3, or 4.

We still need to test common remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
And the remaining vowel: I (since A, O, U are out).

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps N in position 2.
- Places E in position 3 (since it can’t be 4 or 5).
- Places R in position 1 (since it can’t be 2 or 5).
- Adds new letters for positions 4 and 5.

Candidate: R N E _ _  
We need two more letters not yet ruled out. Let’s pick common ones: H and I.

Word: R N E H I → “RNEHI” is not valid.  
Swap to “R I N E _” – but we want E in position 3.  
Try “R E N _ _” – but N must be in position 2.

Wait, let’s re-arrange:  
We have N fixed at position 2.  
E must be in 1 or 3.  
R must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s try E in position 3 and R in position 1:  
R _ N E _  
We need a letter for position 2 and 5.  
Position 2: common unused consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.  
Position 5: same, but let’s pick a vowel first – the only vowel left is I.

Try R B N E I → “RBN EI” is invalid.  
Try R I N E _ – but I is in position 2, E in 3, N in 2? No, N must be in 2.

Wait, structure is:  
Position 1: R or E or new consonant  
Position 2: N (fixed)  
Position 3: E or new letter  
Position 4: R or new letter  
Position 5: new letter  

Let’s try:
R _ N _ _  
We need E somewhere. E can’t be 4 or 5, so E must be 1 or 3.  
If E is in 1: E N _ _ _  
Then R must be in 3 or 4.  
Try E N R _ _ → “ENR__”

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of letters that frequently appear in English words, helping to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word, but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains E, but E is not the last letter.
- The word does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere (not in 5th position).
2. Does NOT have S, L, A, T.

Good letters to try next: R, N, I, O, U, C, D, P, M, etc.

Let’s pick a word that uses common consonants and vowels we haven’t ruled out. “CRONE” is a good candidate:
- C, R, O, N, E.
- E is in position 4 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.
- C, R, O, N are all new letters we haven’t tested yet.

This should give us more information about these new letters while respecting the constraints.

Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CRONE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, O.
- Letters definitely IN the word: R, N, E.
- Positions ruled out for these letters:
  – R cannot be in position 2.
  – N cannot be in position 4.
  – E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.

We still need to test new consonants and vowels. The remaining common letters include D, I, U, P, M, G, H, etc. Let’s try a word that incorporates R, N, E in new positions and adds some fresh letters.

A good candidate is “UNDER”:
- U, N, D, E, R.
- E is now in position 4 (still allowed, since we only know it’s not 5).
- R is in position 5 (new position).
- N is in position 2 (new position).
- U and D are new letters to test.

This should help us narrow down the correct positions for R, N, E while introducing U and D.

This should help us narrow down the correct positions for R, N, E while introducing U and D.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, O, U, D  
- Letters definitely IN the word: N (position 2 is correct), R, E  
- R cannot be in position 2 or 5  
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5  

We now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ N _ _ _  
- R and E must appear somewhere in the remaining positions (1, 3, 4)  
- We still need to test new consonants/vowels: I, G, M, P, H, K, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep N in position 2  
2. Place R and E in new positions  
3. Introduce fresh letters

Candidate: “INFER”
- I (new vowel)  
- N (locked in position 2)  
- F (new consonant)  
- E (allowed in position 4)  
- R (allowed in position 5)  

This satisfies all constraints.

From the latest feedback on INFER:
- I(✓) → I is correct and in position 1
- N(✓) → N is correct and in position 2
- F(x) → F is not in the word
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 5

So the pattern is now: I N _ _ _
Letters known to be in the word: I, N, E, R
Letters known NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, O, U, D, F
Remaining positions (3,4,5) must contain E and R, and one more letter that hasn’t been tested yet.

Possible new letters to test: G, M, P, H, K, Y, etc.

We need to place:
- E somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (cannot be 4)
- R somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (cannot be 5)

Let’s try “INGER”:
- I N G E R
- G is new
- E in position 4 is allowed (only position 5 is disallowed for E)
- R in position 5 is allowed (only position 2 is disallowed for R)
