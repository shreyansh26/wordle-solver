### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, providing valuable information for subsequent guesses.

- The letters A, R, S, E, I, N, T are excluded.

Available letters (excluding the known absent ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- Keeps P O in place.
- Uses three fresh common letters that haven’t been tried yet.
- Uses U (a common vowel we haven’t tested).

Current constraints:
1. First two letters are locked: P O _ _ _
2. Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, U, H
3. From POUCH: C is in the word but not in position 4.

So we need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with P O
- Contains C somewhere (positions 3 or 5, since 4 is excluded)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known C.

Let’s try to place C in position 3 or 5 and fill the remaining slots with fresh letters.

Option 1: C in position 3 → P O C _ _
Need two more letters from the available set. Let’s pick common ones: D and K → P O C D K? Not a valid word.
How about P O C K ? Need 5 letters. Maybe P O C K Y? That’s 5 letters and valid.

Option 2: C in position 5 → P O _ _ C
Possible letters for positions 3 and 4: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Let’s try P O L D C? Not valid.
P O L K C? Not valid.
P O K E C? E is ruled out.

Hmm, many of these aren’t valid words. Let’s step back and try Option 1 with C in position 3 and see if we can find a valid word.

POC _ _ : Need two more letters from available set.
Possible valid words:
- P O C K Y (valid)
- P O C K S (S is ruled out)
- P O C K A (A is ruled out)
- P O C K I (I is ruled out)

Among these, P O C K Y is a common word and uses fresh letters (K and Y). Let’s go with that.

So the next guess is P O C K Y.
