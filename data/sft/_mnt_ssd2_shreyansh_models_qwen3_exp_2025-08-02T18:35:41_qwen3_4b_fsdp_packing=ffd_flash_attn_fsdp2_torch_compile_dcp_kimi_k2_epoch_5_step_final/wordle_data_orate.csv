### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so I expect useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so it must be in positions 1,3-5)
- I is not in the word at all
- S is not in the word at all
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)

So we know:
- The word ends with E
- It contains R and A (but not in their original positions)
- It does NOT contain I or S

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Has R somewhere other than position 1
- Has A somewhere other than position 2
- Does not have I or S

Possible candidates: 
- TREAD (but has S? No, TREAD has T,R,E,A,D - no S, but A is in position 4 which is allowed)
- GRADE (G,R,A,D,E - A is in position 3, R in position 2 - both positions are new)
- FRAME (F,R,A,M,E - same positions as above)
- CREAD (but CREAD isn't a valid word)
- BREAD (B,R,E,A,D - but E is in position 3 here, but we know E is in position 5 - so this is invalid)

Looking at GRADE:
- Ends with E (✓)
- R is in position 2 (was position 1 before - new position ✓)
- A is in position 3 (was position 2 before - new position ✓)
- No I or S ✓

This seems like a good next guess.

- A(✓) → A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3).
- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:

1. Positions:
   - 2: R
   - 3: A
   - 5: E

2. Letters NOT in the word: I, S, G, D

3. Letters still unknown for positions 1 and 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has the pattern _ R A _ E
- Does NOT contain I, S, G, D
- Uses only valid letters.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 4 (excluding I, S, G, D):
- Position 1: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 4: same list, but also considering common letters.

Looking for common words fitting _ R A _ E:

- BRAVE: B, R, A, V, E → V is allowed (not in forbidden list). But we know A is in position 3, so BRAVE would have A in position 3 ✓, R in position 2 ✓, E in position 5 ✓. But V is allowed. However, BRAVE has V in position 4, which is fine.

- CRAVE: C, R, A, V, E → same as above with C instead of B.

- FRARE: Not a valid word.

- TRAPE: Not a valid word.

- BRAKE: B, R, A, K, E → K is allowed.

- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E → N is allowed.

- PRASE: Contains S (forbidden) → invalid.

- TRASE: Contains S → invalid.

- BRAVE and CRANE both fit. Between them, BRAVE is more common.

But let's check if BRAVE has any forbidden letters: B, R, A, V, E → none are forbidden (forbidden are I, S, G, D). So BRAVE is valid.

However, we already know A is in position 3 and E in position 5, so BRAVE would be B R A V E → positions 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=V, 5=E. This fits all constraints.

But wait, we have GRADE feedback showing R in position 2 is correct, A in position 3 is correct, E in position 5 is correct. So the word is _ R A _ E.

Possible words:
- BRAVE
- CRAVE
- CRAPE
- TRAPE (invalid)
- FRARE (invalid)
- PRASE (invalid)

Among these, BRAVE is a valid common word.

But let's think if there's any better fit. CRAVE is also valid.

Between BRAVE and CRAVE, both are good, but BRAVE is more common.

But let me think if there's any other word. For example:

- CARVE: C, A, R, V, E → but A would be in position 2, which conflicts with A being in position 3 from GRADE feedback. So invalid.

- BARVE: Not a valid word.

So BRAVE and CRAVE are the main candidates. BRAVE seems better.

But let me check BRAVE against all constraints:
- Pattern: B R A V E → positions 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=V, 5=E. This fits _ R A _ E.
- Letters used: B, R, A, V, E. Forbidden letters: I, S, G, D → none of these are present. So valid.

Thus, BRAVE is a valid next guess.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so I expect useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

- The word ends with E
- It contains R and A (but not in their original positions)
- It does NOT contain I or S

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Has R somewhere other than position 1
- Has A somewhere other than position 2
- Does not have I or S

Possible candidates: 
- TREAD (but has S? No, TREAD has T,R,E,A,D - no S, but A is in position 4 which is allowed)
- GRADE (G,R,A,D,E - A is in position 3, R in position 2 - both positions are new)
- FRAME (F,R,A,M,E - same positions as above)
- CREAD (but CREAD isn't a valid word)
- BREAD (B,R,E,A,D - but E is in position 3 here, but we know E is in position 5 - so this is invalid)

Looking at GRADE:
- Ends with E (✓)
- R is in position 2 (was position 1 before - new position ✓)
- A is in position 3 (was position 2 before - new position ✓)
- No I or S ✓

This seems like a good next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: GRADE -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on GRADE:

- G(x) → G is NOT in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- A(✓) → A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3).
- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:

1. Positions:
   - 2: R
   - 3: A
   - 5: E

2. Letters NOT in the word: I, S, G, D

3. Letters still unknown for positions 1 and 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has the pattern _ R A _ E
- Does NOT contain I, S, G, D
- Uses only valid letters.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 4 (excluding I, S, G, D):
- Position 1: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 4: same list, but also considering common letters.

Looking for common words fitting _ R A _ E:

- BRAVE: B, R, A, V, E → V is allowed (not in forbidden list). But we know A is in position 3, so BRAVE would have A in position 3 ✓, R in position 2 ✓, E in position 5 ✓. But V is allowed. However, BRAVE has V in position 4, which is fine.

- CRAVE: C, R, A, V, E → same as above with C instead of B.

- FRARE: Not a valid word.

- TRAPE: Not a valid word.

- BRAKE: B, R, A, K, E → K is allowed.

- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E → N is allowed.

- PRASE: Contains S (forbidden) → invalid.

- TRASE: Contains S → invalid.

- BRAVE and CRANE both fit. Between them, BRAVE is more common.

But let's check if BRAVE has any forbidden letters: B, R, A, V, E → none are forbidden (forbidden are I, S, G, D). So BRAVE is valid.

However, we already know A is in position 3 and E in position 5, so BRAVE would be B R A V E → positions 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=V, 5=E. This fits all constraints.

But wait, we have GRADE feedback showing R in position 2 is correct, A in position 3 is correct, E in position 5 is correct. So the word is _ R A _ E.

Possible words:
- BRAVE
- CRAVE
- CRAPE
- TRAPE (invalid)
- FRARE (invalid)
- PRASE (invalid)

Among these, BRAVE is a valid common word.

But let's think if there's any better fit. CRAVE is also valid.

Between BRAVE and CRAVE, both are good, but BRAVE is more common.

But let me think if there's any other word. For example:

- CARVE: C, A, R, V, E → but A would be in position 2, which conflicts with A being in position 3 from GRADE feedback. So invalid.

- BARVE: Not a valid word.

So BRAVE and CRAVE are the main candidates. BRAVE seems better.

But let me check BRAVE against all constraints:
- Pattern: B R A V E → positions 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=V, 5=E. This fits _ R A _ E.
- Letters used: B, R, A, V, E. Forbidden letters: I, S, G, D → none of these are present. So valid.

Thus, BRAVE is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so I expect useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so it must be in positions 1,3-5)
- I is not in the word at all
- S is not in the word at all
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)

So we know:
- The word ends with E
- It contains R and A (but not in their original positions)
- It does NOT contain I or S

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Has R somewhere other than position 1
- Has A somewhere other than position 2
- Does not have I or S

Possible candidates:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so I expect useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so it must be in positions 1,3-5)
- I is not in the word at all
- S is not in the word at all
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)

So we know:
- The word ends with E
- It contains R and A (but not in their original positions)
- It does NOT contain I or S

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Has R somewhere other than position 1
- Has A somewhere other than position 2
- Does not have I or S

Possible candidates: 
- TREAD (but has S? No, TREAD has T,R,E,A,D - no S, but A is in position 4 which is allowed)
- GRADE (G,R,A,D,E - A is in position 3, R in position 2 - both positions are new)
- FRAME (F,R,A,M,E - same positions as above)
- CREAD (but CREAD isn't a valid word)
- BREAD (B,R,E,A,D - but E is in position 3 here, but we know E is in position 5 - so this is invalid)

Looking at GRADE:
- Ends with E (✓)
- R is in position 2 (was position 1 before - new position ✓)
- A is in position 3 (was position 2 before - new position ✓)
- No I or S ✓

This seems like a good next guess.

From the new feedback on GRADE:

- A(✓) → A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3).
- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:

1. Positions:
   - 2: R
   - 3: A
   - 5: E

2. Letters NOT in the word: I, S, G, D

3. Letters still unknown for positions 1 and 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has the pattern _ R A _ E
- Does NOT contain I, S, G, D
- Uses only valid letters.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 4 (excluding I, S, G, D):
- Position 1: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 4: same list, but also considering common letters.

Looking for common words fitting _ R A _ E:

- BRAVE: B, R, A, V, E → V is allowed (not in forbidden list). But we know A is in position 3, so BRAVE would have A in position 3 ✓, R in position 2 ✓, E in position 5 ✓. But V is allowed. However, BRAVE has V in position 4, which is fine.

- CRAVE: C, R, A, V, E → same as above with C instead of B.

- FRARE: Not a valid word.

- TRAPE: Not a valid word.

- BRAKE: B, R, A, K, E → K is allowed.

- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E → N is allowed.

- PRASE: Contains S (forbidden) → invalid.

- TRASE: Contains S → invalid.

- BRAVE and CRANE both fit. Between them, BRAVE is more common.

But let's check if BRAVE has any forbidden letters: B, R, A, V, E → none are forbidden (forbidden are I, S, G, D). So BRAVE is valid.

However, we already know A is in position 3 and E in position 5, so BRAVE would be B R A V E → positions 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=V, 5=E. This fits all constraints.

But wait, we have GRADE feedback showing R in position 2 is correct, A in position 3 is correct, E in position 5 is correct. So the word is _ R A _ E.

Possible words:
- BRAVE
- CRAVE
- CRAPE
- TRAPE (invalid)
- FRARE (invalid)
- PRASE (invalid)

Among these, BRAVE is a valid common word.

But let's think if there's any better fit. CRAVE is also valid.

Between BRAVE and CRAVE, both are good, but BRAVE is more common.

But let me think if there's any other word. For example:

- CARVE: C, A, R, V, E → but A would be in position 2, which conflicts with A being in position 3 from GRADE feedback. So invalid.

- BARVE: Not a valid word.

So BRAVE and CRAVE are the main candidates. BRAVE seems better.

But let me check BRAVE against all constraints:
- Pattern: B R A V E → positions 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=V, 5=E. This fits _ R A _ E.
- Letters used: B, R, A, V, E. Forbidden letters: I, S, G, D → none of these are present. So valid.

Thus, BRAVE is a valid next guess.

Between them, BRAVE is more common.\n\nBut let's check if BRAVE has any forbidden letters: B, R, A, V, E → none are forbidden (forbidden are I, S, G, D). So BRAVE is valid.\n\nHowever, we already know A is in position 3 and E in position 5, so BRAVE would be B R A V E → positions 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=V, 5=E. This fits all constraints.\n\nBut wait, we have GRADE feedback showing R in position 2 is correct, A in position 3 is correct, E in position 5 is correct.
