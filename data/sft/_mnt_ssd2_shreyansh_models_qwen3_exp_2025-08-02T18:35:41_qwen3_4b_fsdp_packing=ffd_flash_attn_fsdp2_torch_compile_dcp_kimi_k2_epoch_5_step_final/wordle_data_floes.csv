### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Has no repeating letters to test more unique letters
3. Uses vowels to help identify vowel positions

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should cover several of these.

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) - covers very common letters
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - covers many vowels
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and has no repeats.

From the two pieces of feedback we now have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - L is fixed in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. FLIES → F(✓) L(✓) I(x) E(✓) S(✓)
   - F is in position 1 (✓).
   - L is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
   - I is not in the word (x).
   - E is in position 4 (✓).
   - S is in position 5 (✓).

So the pattern is now:
F L _ E S

Only the 3rd letter is unknown. We need a letter that:
- Hasn’t been used yet (letters used so far: F, L, E, S)
- Hasn’t been ruled out (letters ruled out so far: A, T, I)

Common remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.

Let’s pick a common one: R.

Word: FLRES → but that’s not valid. We need a valid 5-letter word.

Valid words fitting F L _ E S:
- FLIES (already tried)
- FLUES (valid word, though rare)
- FLIES (already tried)
- FLUES is the only other common word that fits, but it’s less common.

Another valid word is ""FLUES"" (plural of flue), but let’s check if that’s acceptable. If not, we might need to reconsider.

Actually, let’s think of other possibilities. Maybe ""FLUES"" is acceptable, but let’s check if there’s a better common word.

Another valid word is ""FLUES"" (yes, it’s valid). However, let me check if there’s a more common word.

Wait, let me think of other letters for the 3rd position. Maybe N, D, C, etc.

Possible valid words:
- FLUES (valid)
- FLIES (already tried)
- FLUES is the only other valid word fitting F L _ E S.

But let me check if ""FLUES"" is acceptable. It is a valid 5-letter word (plural of flue).

However, let me think if there’s a more common word. Actually, ""FLUES"" is quite rare. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, the pattern is F L _ E S. Let me think of other letters for the 3rd position:

- F L A E S → FLAES (not a valid word)
- F L O E S → FLOES (valid word, plural of floe)
- F L U E S → FLUES (valid)
- F L E E S → FLEES (but E is already in position 4, so this would have E in position 3 and 4, which is impossible)
- F L I E S → FLIES (already tried)
- F L O E S → FLOES (valid, but less common than FLUES)

Between FLUES and FLOES, both are valid, but FLOES is more common in English.

Let me go with FLOES.

But wait, let me check if FLOES is valid. Yes, ""f loes"" is a valid plural of ""floe"".

So the word is F L O E S.

But let me check if that fits all constraints:
- F is in position 1 (✓)
- L is in position 2 (✓)
- O is new and not ruled out
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

This seems correct.

The pattern is now F L _ E S. The only unknown letter is the third position. Common letters that haven't been ruled out and fit the pattern are R, N, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.
