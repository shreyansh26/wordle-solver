For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give me good information about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

From all feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   – L, A, T, E are NOT in the word.

2. CRISP → C(x) R(x) I(x) S(✓) P(-)
   – C, R, I are NOT in the word.
   – S is in the word AND in position 4 (✓).
   – P is in the word but NOT in position 5.

3. NOSPY → N(x) O(✓) S(-) P(-) Y(✓)
   – N is NOT in the word.
   – O is in the word AND in position 2 (✓).
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (but we already know it’s in position 4 from CRISP, so this is consistent).
   – P is in the word but NOT in position 4 (consistent with being in the word but not in position 5 from CRISP).
   – Y is in the word AND in position 5 (✓).

So the secret word has the pattern:
- Position 1: unknown (not S, L, A, T, C, R, I, N)
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 3: unknown (not S, not P, not L, A, T, C, R, I, N)
- Position 4: S (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Therefore the word looks like: _ O _ S Y

We need a 5-letter word of the form ?O?SY using only letters not yet ruled out.

Letters already ruled out: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, N, plus any others used in previous guesses (S, O, P, Y are already known to be present).

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We know P is in the word but not in position 5 (already satisfied since P must be in position 1 or 3). From NOSPY feedback, P was marked “-” in position 4, so P is not in position 4 (already satisfied since position 4 is S).

We need P to appear somewhere in the word, so P must be in position 1 or 3.

Let’s list possible words:

- B O P S Y → “BOPSY” – but “BOPSY” is not a valid English word.
- D O P S Y → “DOPSY” – not a valid word.
- F O P S Y → “FOPSY” – not valid.
- G O P S Y → “GOPS” is 4 letters, so “GOPS Y” is invalid.
- H O P S Y → “HOPSY” – not valid.
- J O P S Y → not valid.
- K O P S Y → not valid.
- M O P S Y → “MOPSY” – valid word (a type of horse).
- P O ? S Y – P in position 1: “PO?SY” – but we need a valid word. “POPSY” is valid.
- U O P S Y → not valid.
- V O P S Y → not valid.
- W O P S Y → not valid.
- X O P S Y → not valid.
- Z O P S Y → not valid.

From these, “MOPSY” and “POPSY” are valid. Let’s choose “MOPSY” first, as it places P in position 3.

Check letters:
- M: allowed
- O: in position 2 (✓)
- P: in position 3 (allowed, not in position 5)
- S: in position 4 (✓)

No conflicts. This seems like the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give me good information about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L(x), A(x), T(x), E(x) → L, A, T, E are NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains S somewhere other than the first position.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, or E.

Next, I want to choose a word that:
1. Contains S (since we know it’s in the word).
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels to try next (since A and E are out): I, O, U.

Let’s pick a word that uses S plus some of these other common letters. “CRISP” comes to mind:
- C, R, I, S, P
- Contains S (and S is in position 4, so it won’t be position 1).
- Avoids L, A, T, E.
- Uses common letters C, R, I, P.

This should give us good information about the remaining letters.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) I(x) S(✓) P(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CRISP:
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- S(✓) → S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- P(-) → P is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So far we know:
- The word ends in S (position 4 = S).
- P is somewhere in the word, but not position 5.
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, R, I.
- Letters still possible: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus P and S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in position 4.
2. Contains P somewhere (not position 5).
3. Uses only letters from the allowed set.

Possible patterns: _ _ _ S P or _ _ _ S _ with P in one of the earlier positions.

Let’s try to think of words that fit:
- ""MOPSY"" – but Y is allowed, but we need to check letters.
- ""BOPPY"" – but double P might not help.
- ""NOSPY"" – uses N, O, S, P, Y.
- ""HOPPS"" – but S is already in position 4, and we don’t know if P is allowed twice.
- ""DOPES"" – but E is out.
- ""GOPS"" – too short.
- ""POSSE"" – but E is out and double S might not help.

Looking at ""NOSPY"":
- N, O, S, P, Y are all allowed (none are in the forbidden list).
- S is in position 4 (✓).
- P is in position 3 (allowed, since P was marked as in the word but not in position 5).
- All letters are new except S which we already know.

This seems like a good next guess to test N, O, P, Y while satisfying all constraints.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give me good information about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L(x), A(x), T(x), E(x) → L, A, T, E are NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains S somewhere other than the first position.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, or E.

Next, I want to choose a word that:
1. Contains S (since we know it’s in the word).
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels to try next (since A and E are out): I, O, U.

Let’s pick a word that uses S plus some of these other common letters. “CRISP” comes to mind:
- C, R, I, S, P
- Contains S (and S is in position 4, so it won’t be position 1).
- Avoids L, A, T, E.
- Uses common letters C, R, I, P.

This should give us good information about the remaining letters.

Guess 2: CRISP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) I(x) S(✓) P(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CRISP:
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- S(✓) → S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- P(-) → P is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So far we know:
- The word ends in S (position 4 = S).
- P is somewhere in the word, but not position 5.
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, R, I.
- Letters still possible: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus P and S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in position 4.
2. Contains P somewhere (not position 5).
3. Uses only letters from the allowed set.

Possible patterns: _ _ _ S P or _ _ _ S _ with P in one of the earlier positions.

Let’s try to think of words that fit:
- ""MOPSY"" – but Y is allowed, but we need to check letters.
- ""BOPPY"" – but double P might not help.
- ""NOSPY"" – uses N, O, S, P, Y.
- ""HOPPS"" – but S is already in position 4, and we don’t know if P is allowed twice.
- ""DOPES"" – but E is out.
- ""GOPS"" – too short.
- ""POSSE"" – but E is out and double S might not help.

Looking at ""NOSPY"":
- N, O, S, P, Y are all allowed (none are in the forbidden list).
- S is in position 4 (✓).
- P is in position 3 (allowed, since P was marked as in the word but not in position 5).
- All letters are new except S which we already know.

This seems like a good next guess to test N, O, P, Y while satisfying all constraints.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

From all feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   – L, A, T, E are NOT in the word.

2. CRISP → C(x) R(x) I(x) S(✓) P(-)
   – C, R, I are NOT in the word.
   – S is in the word AND in position 4 (✓).
   – P is in the word but NOT in position 5.

3. NOSPY → N(x) O(✓) S(-) P(-) Y(✓)
   – N is NOT in the word.
   – O is in the word AND in position 2 (✓).
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (but we already know it’s in position 4 from CRISP, so this is consistent).
   – P is in the word but NOT in position 4 (consistent with being in the word but not in position 5 from CRISP).
   – Y is in the word AND in position 5 (✓).

So the secret word has the pattern:
- Position 1: unknown (not S, L, A, T, C, R, I, N)
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 3: unknown (not S, not P, not L, A, T, C, R, I, N)
- Position 4: S (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Therefore the word looks like: _ O _ S Y

We need a 5-letter word of the form ?O?SY using only letters not yet ruled out.

Letters already ruled out: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, N, plus any others used in previous guesses (S, O, P, Y are already known to be present).

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We know P is in the word but not in position 5 (already satisfied since P must be in position 1 or 3). From NOSPY feedback, P was marked “-” in position 4, so P is not in position 4 (already satisfied since position 4 is S).

We need P to appear somewhere in the word, so P must be in position 1 or 3.

Let’s list possible words:

- B O P S Y → “BOPSY” – but “BOPSY” is not a valid English word.
- D O P S Y → “DOPSY” – not a valid word.
- F O P S Y → “FOPSY” – not valid.
- G O P S Y → “GOPS” is 4 letters, so “GOPS Y” is invalid.
- H O P S Y → “HOPSY” – not valid.
- J O P S Y → not valid.
- K O P S Y → not valid.
- M O P S Y → “MOPSY” – valid word (a type of horse).
- P O ? S Y – P in position 1: “PO?SY” – but we need a valid word. “POPSY” is valid.
- U O P S Y → not valid.
- V O P S Y → not valid.
- W O P S Y → not valid.
- X O P S Y → not valid.
- Z O P S Y → not valid.

From these, “MOPSY” and “POPSY” are valid. Let’s choose “MOPSY” first, as it places P in position 3.

Check letters:
- M: allowed
- O: in position 2 (✓)
- P: in position 3 (allowed, not in position 5)
- S: in position 4 (✓)
- Y: in position 5 (✓)

No conflicts. This seems like the best next guess.
