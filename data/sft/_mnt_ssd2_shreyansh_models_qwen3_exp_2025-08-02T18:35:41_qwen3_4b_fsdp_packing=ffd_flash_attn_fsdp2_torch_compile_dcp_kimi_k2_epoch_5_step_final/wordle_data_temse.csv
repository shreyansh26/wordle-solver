For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeating letters. This gives us maximum coverage of common letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- S is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with ""SE"" and does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with ""SE"".
2. Does not contain A, R, or O.
3. Uses other common letters to gain more information.

Good candidates: ""TENSE"", ""HUMSE"" (invalid), ""MENSE"" (invalid), ""LIMSE"" (invalid), ""PENSE"" (invalid), ""WIPSE"" (invalid), ""BRISE"" (invalid), ""DRISE"" (invalid), ""FRISE"" (invalid), ""PRISE"" (invalid), ""TRIPE"" (invalid), ""VERSE"" (invalid), ""WIPSE"" (invalid).

Looking at valid words ending in ""SE"":
- TENSE (T, E, N, S, E) - but E is already confirmed in 5th position, and N is new.
- LENSE (L, E, N, S, E) - same as above with L.
- MENSE (M, E, N, S, E) - same with M.
- PENSE (P, E, N, S, E) - same with P.
- TENSE seems the most common.

But ""tense"" is a valid word and fits all constraints. However, I want to check if there are other possibilities. Another valid word is ""dense"", but that uses D which is common.

Between ""dense"" and ""tense"", both are good. I'll choose ""dense"" to test D as a new letter.

Wait, let me double-check:
- D is not in the word yet.
- E is confirmed in 5th position.
- N is new.
- S is confirmed in 4th position.
- E is confirmed in 5th position.

""Dense"" seems like a good choice to test D and N.

But another valid word is ""gense"" - but that's not a standard English word. ""Pense"" is a word (French origin, but accepted in Scrabble lists), but ""dense"" is more common.

I'll go with ""dense"" as it's a common word and tests D and N.

- TENSE seems the most common.

But ""tense"" is a valid word and fits all constraints. However, I want to check if there are other possibilities. Another valid word is ""dense"", but that uses D which is common.

Between ""dense"" and ""tense"", both are good. I'll choose ""dense"" to test D as a new letter.

Wait, let me double-check:
- D is not in the word yet.
- E is confirmed in 5th position.
- N is new.
- S is confirmed in 4th position.
- E is confirmed in 5th position.

""Dense"" seems like a good choice to test D and N.

But another valid word is ""gense"" - but that's not a standard English word. ""Pense"" is a word (French origin, but accepted in Scrabble lists), but ""dense"" is more common.

I'll go with ""dense"" as it's a common word and tests D and N.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: dense -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(✓) N(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""dense"":
- D is not in the word (x).
- E is still in the word and in the correct 5th position (✓).
- N is not in the word (x).
- S is still in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓).
- E is confirmed again in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Word ends with ""SE"".
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, D, N.
- Letters confirmed: S (4th), E (5th).

We need a 5-letter word ending in ""SE"" that does not contain A, R, O, D, N.  
Remaining common letters to test: T, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, I, U, Y, etc.

Good candidates:
- ""tense"" – but N is already ruled out.
- ""lipse"" – but P is new, I is new.
- ""mulse"" – not a valid word.
- ""pulse"" – but U and L are new, P is new.
- ""baste"" – but A is ruled out.
- ""cense"" – not a valid word.
- ""girse"" – not a valid word.
- ""haste"" – A is ruled out.
- ""lense"" – N is ruled out.
- ""prise"" – R is ruled out.
- ""trice"" – R is ruled out.
- ""verse"" – R is ruled out.
- ""wirse"" – not a valid word.
- ""yipse"" – not a valid word.

Looking at valid words ending in ""se"" and avoiding the forbidden letters:
- ""tense"" is invalid (N ruled out).
- ""pulse"" – valid word, uses P, U, L.
- ""girse"" – invalid.
- ""lipse"" – valid word, uses L, I, P.
- ""mulse"" – invalid.
- ""pense"" – invalid (not a standard word).
- ""tense"" – invalid (N ruled out).

Between ""lipse"" and ""pulse"":
- ""lipse"" – L, I, P are new letters.
- ""pulse"" – P, U, L are new letters.

Both are good, but ""pulse"" is slightly more common. I'll go with ""pulse"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeating letters. This gives us maximum coverage of common letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- S is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with ""SE"" and does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with ""SE"".
2. Does not contain A, R, or O.
3. Uses other common letters to gain more information.

Good candidates: ""TENSE"", ""HUMSE"" (invalid), ""MENSE"" (invalid), ""LIMSE"" (invalid), ""PENSE"" (invalid), ""WIPSE"" (invalid), ""BRISE"" (invalid), ""DRISE"" (invalid), ""FRISE"" (invalid), ""PRISE"" (invalid), ""TRIPE"" (invalid), ""VERSE"" (invalid), ""WIPSE"" (invalid).

Looking at valid words ending in ""SE"":
- TENSE (T, E, N, S, E) - but E is already confirmed in 5th position, and N is new.
- LENSE (L, E, N, S, E) - same as above with L.
- MENSE (M, E, N, S, E) - same with M.
- PENSE (P, E, N, S, E) - same with P.
- TENSE seems the most common.

But ""tense"" is a valid word and fits all constraints. However, I want to check if there are other possibilities. Another valid word is ""dense"", but that uses D which is common.

Between ""dense"" and ""tense"", both are good. I'll choose ""dense"" to test D as a new letter.

Wait, let me double-check:
- D is not in the word yet.
- E is confirmed in 5th position.
- N is new.
- S is confirmed in 4th position.
- E is confirmed in 5th position.

""Dense"" seems like a good choice to test D and N.

But another valid word is ""gense"" - but that's not a standard English word. ""Pense"" is a word (French origin, but accepted in Scrabble lists), but ""dense"" is more common.

I'll go with ""dense"" as it's a common word and tests D and N.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: dense -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(✓) N(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""dense"":
- D is not in the word (x).
- E is still in the word and in the correct 5th position (✓).
- N is not in the word (x).
- S is still in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓).
- E is confirmed again in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Word ends with ""SE"".
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, D, N.
- Letters confirmed: S (4th), E (5th).

We need a 5-letter word ending in ""SE"" that does not contain A, R, O, D, N.  
Remaining common letters to test: T, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, I, U, Y, etc.

Good candidates:
- ""tense"" – but N is already ruled out.
- ""lipse"" – but P is new, I is new.
- ""mulse"" – not a valid word.
- ""pulse"" – but U and L are new, P is new.
- ""baste"" – but A is ruled out.
- ""cense"" – not a valid word.
- ""girse"" – not a valid word.
- ""haste"" – A is ruled out.
- ""lense"" – N is ruled out.
- ""prise"" – R is ruled out.
- ""trice"" – R is ruled out.
- ""verse"" – R is ruled out.
- ""wirse"" – not a valid word.
- ""yipse"" – not a valid word.

Looking at valid words ending in ""se"" and avoiding the forbidden letters:
- ""tense"" is invalid (N ruled out).
- ""pulse"" – valid word, uses P, U, L.
- ""girse"" – invalid.
- ""lipse"" – valid word, uses L, I, P.
- ""mulse"" – invalid.
- ""pense"" – invalid (not a standard word).
- ""tense"" – invalid (N ruled out).

Between ""lipse"" and ""pulse"":
- ""lipse"" – L, I, P are new letters.
- ""pulse"" – P, U, L are new letters.

Both are good, but ""pulse"" is slightly more common. I'll go with ""pulse"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeating letters. This gives us maximum coverage of common letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- S is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with ""SE"" and does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with ""SE"".
2. Does not contain A, R, or O.
3. Uses other common letters to gain more information.

Good candidates: ""TENSE"", ""HUMSE"" (invalid), ""MENSE"" (invalid), ""LIMSE"" (invalid), ""PENSE"" (invalid), ""WIPSE"" (invalid), ""BRISE"" (invalid), ""DRISE"" (invalid), ""FRISE"" (invalid), ""PRISE"" (invalid), ""TRIPE"" (invalid), ""VERSE"" (invalid), ""WIPSE"" (invalid).

Looking at valid words ending in ""SE"":
- TENSE (T, E, N, S, E) - but E is already confirmed in 5th position, and N is new.
- LENSE (L, E, N, S, E) - same as above with L.
- MENSE (M, E, N, S, E) - same with M.
- PENSE (P, E, N, S, E) - same with P.
- TENSE seems the most common.

But ""tense"" is a valid word and fits all constraints. However, I want to check if there are other possibilities. Another valid word is ""dense"", but that uses D which is common.

Between ""dense"" and ""tense"", both are good. I'll choose ""dense"" to test D as a new letter.

Wait, let me double-check:
- D is not in the word yet.
- E is confirmed in 5th position.
- N is new.
- S is confirmed in 4th position.
- E is confirmed in 5th position.

""Dense"" seems like a good choice to test D and N.

But another valid word is ""gense"" - but that's not a standard English word. ""Pense"" is a word (French origin, but accepted in Scrabble lists), but ""dense"" is more common.

I'll go with ""dense"" as it's a common word and tests D and N.

Guess 2: dense -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(✓) N(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""dense"":
- D is not in the word (x).
- E is still in the word and in the correct 5th position (✓).
- N is not in the word (x).
- S is still in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓).
- E is confirmed again in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Word ends with ""SE"".
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, D, N.
- Letters confirmed: S (4th), E (5th).

We need a 5-letter word ending in ""SE"" that does not contain A, R, O, D, N.  
Remaining common letters to test: T, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, I, U, Y, etc.

Good candidates:
- ""tense"" – but N is already ruled out.
- ""lipse"" – but P is new, I is new.
- ""mulse"" – not a valid word.
- ""pulse"" – but U and L are new, P is new.
- ""baste"" – but A is ruled out.
- ""cense"" – not a valid word.
- ""girse"" – not a valid word.
- ""haste"" – A is ruled out.
- ""lense"" – N is ruled out.
- ""prise"" – R is ruled out.
- ""trice"" – R is ruled out.
- ""verse"" – R is ruled out.
- ""wirse"" – not a valid word.
- ""yipse"" – not a valid word.

Looking at valid words ending in ""se"" and avoiding the forbidden letters:
- ""tense"" is invalid (N ruled out).
- ""pulse"" – valid word, uses P, U, L.
- ""girse"" – invalid.
- ""lipse"" – valid word, uses L, I, P.
- ""mulse"" – invalid.
- ""pense"" – invalid (not a standard word).
- ""tense"" – invalid (N ruled out).

Between ""lipse"" and ""pulse"":
- ""lipse"" – L, I, P are new letters.
- ""pulse"" – P, U, L are new letters.

Both are good, but ""pulse"" is slightly more common. I'll go with ""pulse"".

From the latest feedback on **miste**:

- M: in the word but wrong position (-)  
- I: not in the word (x)  
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)  
- T: in the word but wrong position (-)  
- E: confirmed in 5th position (✓)

So we now know:

1. The word ends in **E** (5th letter).  
2. The letters **S, T, M** are all in the word but not in their current positions.  
3. The letters **A, R, O, D, N, P, U, L, I** are **not** in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter word ending in **E** that contains **S, T, M** and none of the banned letters.  
Positions so far:

1 2 3 4 5  
? ? ? ? E

We have three required letters (S, T, M) to place in positions 1-4, and one additional letter (from the remaining pool: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s list possible arrangements:

- S, T, M must all appear once.  
- One of the remaining three positions must be filled by another allowed letter.

Valid English words that fit:

- **maste** – A banned.
