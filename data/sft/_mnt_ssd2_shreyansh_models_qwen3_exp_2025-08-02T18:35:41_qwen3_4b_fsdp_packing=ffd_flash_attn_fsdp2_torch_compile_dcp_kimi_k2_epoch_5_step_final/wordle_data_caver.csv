### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - good vowel coverage)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly effective because it includes very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and provides good coverage for both vowels and consonants. This will help narrow down possible letters and their positions efficiently.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - good vowel coverage)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly effective because it includes very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and provides good coverage for both vowels and consonants. This will help narrow down possible letters and their positions efficiently.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is correct in position 1 (✓)
- R is in the word but wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but wrong position (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- First letter is C
- R, A, E are somewhere in positions 2-5 but not where they were
- N is not present

We need a word that:
1. Starts with C
2. Contains R, A, E in some permutation of positions 2-5
3. Does not contain N

Possible candidates:
- CARET (but T is untested and we have no info on T yet)
- CREPE (but P is untested)
- CRAVE (V is untested)
- CATER (T is untested)

Among these, ""CATER"" seems good because:
- Starts with C
- Contains R, A, E in different positions
- Uses T, which is a common letter and hasn't been tested
- No N present

From all feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
   - C is fixed in position 1.
   - R, A, E are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.
   - N is not in the word.

2. CATER → C(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - Confirms C, A, E, R in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.
   - T is not in the word.

3. CAPER → C(✓) A(✓) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - Confirms C, A, E, R in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.
   - P is not in the word.

So the pattern is:
C A _ E R

We need a single letter for position 3 that:
- Has not been ruled out (not N, T, P)
- Has not been used in positions 1,2,4,5 (so not C, A, E, R)

Common letters left: D, G, L, M, S, etc.

Possible valid words:
- C A D E R (CADER - not a common word)
- C A G E R (CAGER - valid)
- C A L E R (CALER - not a word)
- C A M E R (CAMER - not a word)
- C A S E R (Caser - not valid)
- C A G E R seems to be the only common word left.

Let's check: C A G E R - yes, that's valid.

So far we know the pattern is C A _ E R and the third letter cannot be N, T, P, G.  
Letters already ruled out for position 3: N, T, P, G.  
Letters already used in the word: C, A, E, R.  
Therefore the missing letter must be a new consonant that has not appeared yet.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking at valid 5-letter words that fit C A _ E R:
- C A B E R (CABER - valid)
- C A D E R (CADER - not common)
- C A F E R (CAFER - not a word)
- C A H E R (CHAER - not a word)
- C A L E R (CALER - not a word)
- C A M E R (CAMER - not a word)
- C A S E R (CASER - not a word)
- C A V E R (CAVER - valid)
- C A Z E R (CAZER - not a word)

Between CABER and CAVER, both are valid, but CABER is more likely.  
Let's try CABER.
