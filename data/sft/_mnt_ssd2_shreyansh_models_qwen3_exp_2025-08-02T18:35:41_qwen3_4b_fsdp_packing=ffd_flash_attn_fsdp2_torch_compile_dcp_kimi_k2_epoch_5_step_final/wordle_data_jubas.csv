For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five of the most common letters and includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but I'll go with ""AROSE"" since it includes O which is slightly less common but still very frequent, and gives me more vowel coverage.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and S, but not in positions 1 or 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has both A and S (but A not in position 1, S not in position 4).
2. Does not have R, O, or E.
3. Has 5 letters total.

Possible letters left (excluding R, O, E): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place A and S somewhere, and fill the rest with allowed letters. Let's try to find a word that satisfies these constraints.

One approach is to try words with A and S in different positions. For example:
- SAINT: S in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), but we need to check if it contains any forbidden letters (R, O, E). It doesn't, but let's see if it's a valid guess.
- STAIN: S in position 1 (allowed), T, A, I, N. No forbidden letters.
- PLAYS: P, L, A, Y, S. A in position 3 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed). This seems good.

""PLAYS"" uses P, L, A, Y, S:
- A is in position 3 (not 1, so allowed).
- S is in position 5 (not 4, so allowed).
- Contains no R, O, E.

1. Has both A and S (but A not in position 1, S not in position 4).
2. Does not have R, O, or E.
3. Has 5 letters total.

Possible letters left (excluding R, O, E): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place A and S somewhere, and fill the rest with allowed letters. Let's try to find a word that satisfies these constraints.

One approach is to try words with A and S in different positions. For example:
- SAINT: S in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), but we need to check if it contains any forbidden letters (R, O, E). It doesn't, but let's see if it's a valid guess.
- STAIN: S in position 1 (allowed), T, A, I, N. No forbidden letters.
- PLAYS: P, L, A, Y, S. A in position 3 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed). This seems good.

""PLAYS"" uses P, L, A, Y, S:
- A is in position 3 (not 1, so allowed).
- S is in position 5 (not 4, so allowed).
- Contains no R, O, E.

This seems like a strong second guess.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAYS → P(x) L(x) A(-) Y(x) S(✓)

What we now know:
1. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, P, L, Y
2. Letters definitely in the word and in the correct position: S in position 5
3. Letters definitely in the word but in the wrong positions: A (but not in position 1 or 3)

So the secret word ends with S and contains A somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (since positions 1 and 3 are ruled out for A).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S
- Contains A in position 2 or 4
- Does NOT contain R, O, E, P, L, Y

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

Let’s try A in position 2:
- _ A _ _ S
Looking for common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, T
Possible words: BAGAS (not valid), CAFAS (not valid), DAKAS (not valid), etc. Not many good options.

Now try A in position 4:
- _ _ _ A S
Common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, T
Possible words: BANDS (but N is allowed, D is allowed), CHADS (but C, H, D are allowed), MACHS (not valid), etc.

""BANDS"" seems valid:
- B, A, N, D, S
- Ends with S (✓)
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- Contains no forbidden letters (R, O, E, P, L, Y)

Let’s use BANDS as the next guess.

- Letters definitely in the word but misplaced: A (cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3)  
- Letters definitely in the word and in the correct position: S (position 5).

So A must be in position 4 (only remaining spot for A).

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five of the most common letters and includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but I'll go with ""AROSE"" since it includes O which is slightly less common but still very frequent, and gives me more vowel coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and S, but not in positions 1 or 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has both A and S (but A not in position 1, S not in position 4).
2. Does not have R, O, or E.
3. Has 5 letters total.

Possible letters left (excluding R, O, E): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place A and S somewhere, and fill the rest with allowed letters. Let's try to find a word that satisfies these constraints.

One approach is to try words with A and S in different positions. For example:
- SAINT: S in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), but we need to check if it contains any forbidden letters (R, O, E). It doesn't, but let's see if it's a valid guess.
- STAIN: S in position 1 (allowed), T, A, I, N. No forbidden letters.
- PLAYS: P, L, A, Y, S. A in position 3 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed). This seems good.

""PLAYS"" uses P, L, A, Y, S:
- A is in position 3 (not 1, so allowed).
- S is in position 5 (not 4, so allowed).
- Contains no R, O, E.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after four guesses.

1. Position 5 is definitely S (from every guess).
2. A is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (it was “-” in all those spots).  
   → This is impossible unless A is allowed in position 5, but position 5 is already S.  
   Therefore, A must be in position 5, but position 5 is S.  
   This contradiction tells us our earlier interpretation was wrong.

Re-examining the feedback:

- Guess 1 (AROSE): A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 1.  
  S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 4.  
- Guess 2 (PLAYS): S(✓) means S is in position 5.

- Guess 3 (BANDS): A(-) again means A is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since it was “-” in positions 1 and 2 again).  
  Therefore A must be in position 4.  
- Guess 4 (MATCH): A(-) confirms A is not in position 2 (but we already know it must be in 4).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five of the most common letters and includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but I'll go with ""AROSE"" since it includes O which is slightly less common but still very frequent, and gives me more vowel coverage.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and S, but not in positions 1 or 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has both A and S (but A not in position 1, S not in position 4).
2. Does not have R, O, or E.
3. Has 5 letters total.

Possible letters left (excluding R, O, E): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place A and S somewhere, and fill the rest with allowed letters. Let's try to find a word that satisfies these constraints.

One approach is to try words with A and S in different positions. For example:
- SAINT: S in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), but we need to check if it contains any forbidden letters (R, O, E). It doesn't, but let's see if it's a valid guess.
- STAIN: S in position 1 (allowed), T, A, I, N. No forbidden letters.
- PLAYS: P, L, A, Y, S. A in position 3 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed). This seems good.

""PLAYS"" uses P, L, A, Y, S:
- A is in position 3 (not 1, so allowed).
- S is in position 5 (not 4, so allowed).
- Contains no R, O, E.

This seems like a strong second guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLAYS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) Y(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAYS → P(x) L(x) A(-) Y(x) S(✓)

What we now know:
1. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, P, L, Y
2. Letters definitely in the word and in the correct position: S in position 5
3. Letters definitely in the word but in the wrong positions: A (but not in position 1 or 3)

So the secret word ends with S and contains A somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (since positions 1 and 3 are ruled out for A).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S
- Contains A in position 2 or 4
- Does NOT contain R, O, E, P, L, Y

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

Let’s try A in position 2:
- _ A _ _ S
Looking for common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, T
Possible words: BAGAS (not valid), CAFAS (not valid), DAKAS (not valid), etc. Not many good options.

Now try A in position 4:
- _ _ _ A S
Common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, T
Possible words: BANDS (but N is allowed, D is allowed), CHADS (but C, H, D are allowed), MACHS (not valid), etc.

""BANDS"" seems valid:
- B, A, N, D, S
- Ends with S (✓)
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- Contains no forbidden letters (R, O, E, P, L, Y)

Let’s use BANDS as the next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Known facts
- Word ends in S (position 5 is S).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, P, L, Y, N, D.
- Letters definitely in the word but misplaced: A (cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3)  
- Letters definitely in the word and in the correct position: S (position 5).

So A must be in position 4 (only remaining spot for A).

Current pattern: _ _ _ A S

Letters still allowed (excluding the banned ones):  
A, B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two consonants for positions 1 and 2, and one consonant for position 3, all from the allowed list.

Common 5-letter words fitting _ _ _ A S:
- CHATS – but T is allowed, C and H are allowed.  
- MATCH – M, A, T, C, H. All letters are allowed.  
- GLOAT – but O is banned.  
- BLOAT – O is banned.  
- FOCUS – O is banned.

From all feedback:

- Position 5 is definitely S (✓ in every guess).  
- Position 4 is definitely A (✓ in VIVAS).  
- Letters ruled out: R, O, E, P, L, Y, N, D, M, T, C, H, V, I.

So the word has the pattern: _ _ _ A S  
Allowed letters (excluding all banned ones): B, F, G, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z.

We need three consonants for positions 1, 2, 3 chosen from {B, F, G, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Z}.  
Looking for common 5-letter English words ending in “AS” with three consonants before A:

- BAGAS – invalid  
- FUGAS – invalid  
- KIASE – invalid  
- JUKEA – invalid  
- BUCKS – ends in KS, not AS  
- BUDDA – ends in DA  
- BUBAS – ends in AS, letters B, U, B, A, S. B and U are allowed.  
- GUKAS – invalid  
- JUKAS – invalid
