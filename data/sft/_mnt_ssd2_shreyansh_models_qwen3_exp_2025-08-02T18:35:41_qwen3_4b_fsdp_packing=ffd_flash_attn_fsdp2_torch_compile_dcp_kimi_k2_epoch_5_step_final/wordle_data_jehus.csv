For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (common vowel)

This combination provides good coverage of frequently used letters in English words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 1).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 5).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S somewhere other than position 1.
2. Contains E somewhere other than position 5.
3. Does NOT contain L, A, or T.

Possible letters we still have: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for a word that uses S and E in different positions and avoids L, A, T. A good candidate is ""SHIRE"":
- S is now at position 1 (but feedback said S is in the word but not at position 1, so this is still bad).
Wait, that’s the same position for S. Let’s try ""RISEN"":
- R, I, S, E, N.
- S is at position 3 (not 1), E is at position 4 (not 5), and avoids L, A, T.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (common vowel)

This combination provides good coverage of frequently used letters in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 1).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 5).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S somewhere other than position 1.
2. Contains E somewhere other than position 5.
3. Does NOT contain L, A, or T.

Possible letters we still have: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for a word that uses S and E in different positions and avoids L, A, T. A good candidate is ""SHIRE"":
- S is now at position 1 (but feedback said S is in the word but not at position 1, so this is still bad).
Wait, that’s the same position for S. Let’s try ""RISEN"":
- R, I, S, E, N.
- S is at position 3 (not 1), E is at position 4 (not 5), and avoids L, A, T.
This seems valid.

S(-) – S is in the word but not at position 3  
E(-) – E is in the word but not at position 4  
N(x) – N is not in the word  

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: L, A, T, R, I, N  
- Letters that ARE in the word: S, E  
- S cannot be in position 1 or 3  
- E cannot be in position 4 or 5  

We still need three more letters (positions 1-5) that are not among the eliminated set.  
Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A, I, E are partially known).

Let’s try to place S and E in new spots and fill the rest with safe letters.  
A promising pattern: S _ _ E _ or _ S _ _ E or _ _ S E _ etc.

One candidate word: “SHOES”  
- S at position 1 (but feedback says S is not at 1) – invalid.  
Another: “HOUSE”

Let's update what we now know from all feedback so far.

Letters NOT in the word:
L, A, T, R, I, N, P, O, C, W

Letters that ARE in the word:
- E (position 2) – confirmed ✓ in guess 3  
- S (position 5) – confirmed ✓ in guess 3  
- H is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from guess 4: H(-))  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from guess 4: E(-)) – but we already know E is fixed at position 2, so this is consistent.

Current pattern: _ E _ _ S  
We still need letters for positions 1, 3, 4, and the remaining letters must not be any of the eliminated ones.

Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out):
B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We also know H is somewhere in the word (positions 1, 3, or 4), because it's marked (-) in guess 4 (wrong position).

So the word must contain H in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let's list possible combinations:

1. H E _ _ S – but H is in position 1, then positions 3,4 need two letters from remaining pool.
2. _ E H _ S – H in position 3.
3. _ E _ H S – H in position 4.

Let's try _ E H _ S.  
We need a letter for position 1 and 4, from remaining pool.

Good common letters: B, D, F, G, K, M, U, V

Try B: B E H _ S – need a letter for position 4.  
Try G: B E H G S – ""BEHGS"" not a word.  
Try D: B E H D S – ""BEHDS"" not a word.  
Try M: B E H M S – ""BEHMS"" not a word.  
Try K: B E H K S – ""BEHKS"" not a word.

Letters NOT in the word:
L, A, T, R, I, N, P, O, C, W

Letters that ARE in the word:
- E (position 2) – confirmed ✓ in guess 3  
- S (position 5) – confirmed ✓ in guess 3  
- H is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from guess 4: H(-))  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from guess 4: E(-)) – but we already know E is fixed at position 2, so this is consistent.

Current pattern: _ E _ _ S  
We still need letters for positions 1, 3, 4, and the remaining letters must not be any of the eliminated ones.

Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out):
B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We also know H is somewhere in the word (positions 1, 3, or 4), because it's marked (-) in guess 4 (wrong position).

So the word must contain H in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let's list possible combinations:

1. H E _ _ S – but H is in position 1, then positions 3,4 need two letters from remaining pool.
2. _ E H _ S – H in position 3.
3. _ E _ H S – H in position 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (common vowel)

This combination provides good coverage of frequently used letters in English words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 1).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 5).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S somewhere other than position 1.
2. Contains E somewhere other than position 5.
3. Does NOT contain L, A, or T.

Possible letters we still have: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for a word that uses S and E in different positions and avoids L, A, T. A good candidate is ""SHIRE"":
- S is now at position 1 (but feedback said S is in the word but not at position 1, so this is still bad).
Wait, that’s the same position for S. Let’s try ""RISEN"":
- R, I, S, E, N.
- S is at position 3 (not 1), E is at position 4 (not 5), and avoids L, A, T.
This seems valid.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RISEN -> FEEDBACK: R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's process the new feedback from RISEN:

R(x) – R is not in the word  
I(x) – I is not in the word  
S(-) – S is in the word but not at position 3  
E(-) – E is in the word but not at position 4  
N(x) – N is not in the word  

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: L, A, T, R, I, N  
- Letters that ARE in the word: S, E  
- S cannot be in position 1 or 3  
- E cannot be in position 4 or 5  

We still need three more letters (positions 1-5) that are not among the eliminated set.  
Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A, I, E are partially known).

Let’s try to place S and E in new spots and fill the rest with safe letters.  
A promising pattern: S _ _ E _ or _ S _ _ E or _ _ S E _ etc.

One candidate word: “SHOES”  
- S at position 1 (but feedback says S is not at 1) – invalid.  
Another: “HOUSE”  
- H, O, U, S, E  
- S at position 4 (allowed), E at position 5 (but feedback says E is not at 5) – invalid.  
Another: “CUSED”  
- C, U, S, E, D  
- S at 3 (invalid), E at 4 (invalid) – no.  
Another: “MUSED”  
Same issue with S at 3.  
Another: “SPUME”  
- S at 1 (invalid).  
Another: “WESUX” (invalid, X rarely used).  
Another: “DUSKY” – no E.  
Another: “PEKES” – S at 5, E at 3 (invalid).  
Another: “BESOM” – B, E, S, O, M  
- S at 3 (invalid).  
Another: “BEDES” – same issue.  
Another: “SEBUM” – S at 1 (invalid).  
Another: “OCEAN” – no S.  
Another: “SPOKE” – S at 1 (invalid).  
Another: “SCOPE” – S at 1 (invalid).  
Another: “BOGEY” – no S.  
Another: “PESOS” – S at 5, E at 2.  
- S at 5 (allowed), E at 2 (allowed), and avoids all eliminated letters.  
Check: P, E, S, O, S – valid 5-letter word.  

Let’s go with “PESOS”.

Guess 3: PESOS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) S(-) O(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on PESOS:

P(x) – P is not in the word  
E(✓) – E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2)  
S(-) – S is in the word but not at position 3  
O(x) – O is not in the word  
S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5)

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, R, I, N, P, O  
- Letters that ARE in the word: E (position 2), S (position 5)  
- We still need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters not yet eliminated.

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: U (A and I are out, O is out, E is already placed)

We have the pattern: _ E _ _ S

Let’s pick a common consonant for position 1.  
Good candidates: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, W

Let’s try “CHEWS”:
- C, H, E, W, S  
- E is at 2 (correct), S is at 5 (correct).  
- C, H, W are not yet eliminated.  
- Avoids all known absent letters.

Check if “CHEWS” is a valid 5-letter word: yes.

Letters that ARE in the word:
- E (position 2) – confirmed ✓ in guess 3  
- S (position 5) – confirmed ✓ in guess 3  
- H is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from guess 4: H(-))  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from guess 4: E(-)) – but we already know E is fixed at position 2, so this is consistent.

Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out):
B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We also know H is somewhere in the word (positions 1, 3, or 4), because it's marked (-) in guess 4 (wrong position).

2. _ E H _ S – H in position 3.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (from every “x”):
L, A, T, R, I, N, P, O, C, W, M

Letters that ARE in the word and their correct positions:
- E is fixed at position 2
- S is fixed at position 5
- U is fixed at position 4

So the pattern is: _ E _ U S

We also know H is in the word but NOT at positions 1 or 2 (from guesses 4 and 5).  
Therefore H must be at position 3.

That gives us the only possible arrangement:
_ E H U S

We need a letter for position 1 that has not been eliminated yet.  
Available letters (not in the “x” list): B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, X, Y, Z

Looking for common 5-letter English words that fit “? E H U S”:

- B E H U S → “BEHUS” (not valid)
- D E H U S → “DEHUS” (not valid)
- F E H U S → “FEHUS” (not valid)
- G E H U S → “GEHUS” (not valid)
- J E H U S → “JEHUS” (valid, though rare)
- K E H U S → “KEHUS” (not valid)
- V E H U S → “VEHUS” (valid, archaic)
- X E H U S → “XEHUS” (not valid)
- Y E H U S → “YEHUS” (not valid)
- Z E H U S → “ZEHUS” (not valid)

The only two valid dictionary entries are:
1. JEHUS (variant spelling of Jesus)
2. VEHUS (plural of vehu, a small fish)

Between these, JEHUS is more widely recognized in word lists.
