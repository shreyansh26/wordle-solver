For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. After considering several options, ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English words

This should give me good coverage for the first guess to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A: x → not in the word at all  
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2  
- O: ✓ → in the word and in position 3  
- S: x → not in the word at all  
- E: x → not in the word at all  

So far we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.  
- It contains an R somewhere other than position 2.  
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E.  

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps the O in position 3.  
2. Uses R in a new position (not 2).  
3. Introduces other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out yet.  

A good candidate is “ROUND”:
- O stays in position 3.  
- R moves to position 2 (allowed since feedback only said R isn’t in position 2, not necessarily position 1).  
- N and D are new letters that haven’t been tested.  
- U is another vowel that hasn’t been ruled out.  

This should help narrow down the remaining possibilities efficiently.

Let's consolidate what we now know after the two guesses.

From Guess 1 (arose):
- A, S, E are not in the word at all.
- O is in the word and is in position 3.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

From Guess 2 (round):
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (since it got “-” again).
- O is in the word but not in position 2 (since it got “-” here too).
- U, N, D are not in the word.

So far:
- O must be in position 3 (from arose).
- R must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 2, so R must be in position 4 or 5.
- Forbidden letters so far: A, S, E, U, N, D.
- Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z plus R and O.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 3.
- R in position 4 or 5.
- No other forbidden letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ O R _
- _ _ O _ R

Let's think of common words that fit these patterns:
- ""CORNY"" – but N is forbidden.
- ""FORGE"" – E is forbidden.
- ""BROOK"" – O is in position 3, R in position 2 (forbidden by arose feedback).
- ""GROIN"" – N is forbidden.
- ""PROWL"" – W, L are allowed, but let's check: P, R, O, W, L. R is in position 2 (forbidden).
- ""TROOP"" – O is in position 3, R in position 2 (forbidden).
- ""CROOK"" – O in position 3, R in position 2 (forbidden).
- ""FROST"" – S is forbidden.
- ""GROVY"" – not a valid word.
- ""HORNY"" – N is forbidden.
- ""JOKER"" – E is forbidden.
- ""KROON"" – N is forbidden.
- ""MORPH"" – H, P, M are allowed, but R is in position 2 (forbidden).
- ""TOPRO"" – not a valid word.
- ""WORRY"" – Y is allowed, R is in position 2 (forbidden).
- ""BROTH"" – B, T, H are allowed, R is in position 2 (forbidden).
- ""CROAK"" – A is forbidden.
- ""DROOL"" – D is forbidden.
- ""FROCK"" – C, K are allowed, R is in position 2 (forbidden).
- ""GROAN"" – A, N are forbidden.
- ""HORSE"" – S, E are forbidden.
- ""JOKER"" – E is forbidden.
- ""KROON"" – N is forbidden.
- ""LORRY"" – R is in position 2 (forbidden).
- ""MORPH"" – R is in position 2 (forbidden).
- ""PORKY"" – K, Y are allowed, R is in position 2 (forbidden).
- ""TROOP"" – R is in position 2 (forbidden).
- ""VORTEX"" – X is allowed, but E is forbidden.
- ""WORSE"" – S, E are forbidden.
- ""YORICK"" – too long.
- ""ZORRO"" – Z, R, O are allowed, R is in position 5 (allowed), but double R might be okay.

""ZORRO"" seems valid:
- Z, O, R, R, O. But O is already in position 3, and we can't have O in position 5 because we don't know if O is duplicated. Also, the second R is in position 4 (allowed), but we need to check if this is the best.

Another candidate: ""CROON"" – N is forbidden.

""PROWL"" – R is in position 2 (forbidden).

""TOPRO"" – not a valid word.

""FROCK"" – R is in position 2 (forbidden).

""KROON"" – N is forbidden.

""JOKER"" – E is forbidden.

""JOKER"" is invalid because of E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. After considering several options, ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English words

This should give me good coverage for the first guess to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A: x → not in the word at all  
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2  
- O: ✓ → in the word and in position 3  
- S: x → not in the word at all  
- E: x → not in the word at all  

So far we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.  
- It contains an R somewhere other than position 2.  
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E.  

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps the O in position 3.  
2. Uses R in a new position (not 2).  
3. Introduces other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out yet.  

A good candidate is “ROUND”:
- O stays in position 3.  
- R moves to position 2 (allowed since feedback only said R isn’t in position 2, not necessarily position 1).  
- N and D are new letters that haven’t been tested.  
- U is another vowel that hasn’t been ruled out.  

This should help narrow down the remaining possibilities efficiently.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after the two guesses:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is fixed in position 3.  
   – R exists somewhere, but NOT in position 2.  
   – A, S, E are absent.

2. round → R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)  
   – O is NOT in position 2 (it already knew it’s in position 3, so this is redundant).  
   – R is NOT in position 1.  
   – U, N, D are absent.

So far:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- R must be in position 3 or 4 (but 3 is already O), so R must be in position 4.
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, U, N, D.
- Still-allowed common letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has O in position 3.  
- Has R in position 4.  
- Introduces new consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.

A good candidate is “FORGY”:
- F, G, Y are new letters.  
- O in position 3, R in position 4.  
- No forbidden letters.

But “FORGY” is uncommon. A more common word with the same pattern is “CROAK”:
- C, K are new.  
- O in 3, R in 4.  
- A is forbidden, so that won’t work.

Next candidate: “BORIC” – but C and I are allowed, but R is in 4, O in 3.  
“BORIC” has R in position 4, O in position 3.  
Letters: B, O, R, I, C – none of which are forbidden.

This seems valid.

Let’s go with “boric”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. After considering several options, ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English words

This should give me good coverage for the first guess to narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A: x → not in the word at all  
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2  
- O: ✓ → in the word and in position 3  
- S: x → not in the word at all  
- E: x → not in the word at all  

So far we know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.  
- It contains an R somewhere other than position 2.  
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E.  

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps the O in position 3.  
2. Uses R in a new position (not 2).  
3. Introduces other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out yet.  

A good candidate is “ROUND”:
- O stays in position 3.  
- R moves to position 2 (allowed since feedback only said R isn’t in position 2, not necessarily position 1).  
- N and D are new letters that haven’t been tested.  
- U is another vowel that hasn’t been ruled out.  

This should help narrow down the remaining possibilities efficiently.

   – O is NOT in position 2 (again redundant).  
   – R is NOT in position 4.

So far:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- R must be in position 1 or 3 or 5.  But position 3 is O, so R must be in position 1 or 5.
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, U, N, D, B, I, C.

Remaining common letters: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y, plus the vowels we haven’t tested: none left (A, E, I, O, U are partially ruled out).

Let’s try R in position 1: R _ O _ _  
A common word starting with R and having O in position 3 is “RHOXY” – but X is rare.  
Another is “ROGER” – but G and E are allowed? E is forbidden.  
“ROGER” fails because E is forbidden.

“TROOP” has O in position 3 and R in position 5.

Also, T and P haven’t been tested yet.

Another candidate: “GROUT” – but U is forbidden.  
“CROAK” – C is forbidden.  
“FROST” – S is forbidden.  
“FROCK” – C is forbidden.

“MORPH” – M, O, R, P, H.  All letters allowed so far.  
“MORPH” has O in position 3 and R in position 4 – but earlier feedback says R is NOT in position 4 (from boric feedback).  
So “MORPH” is invalid because R would be in position 4.

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is fixed in position 3.  
   – R exists somewhere, but NOT in position 2.  
   – A, S, E are absent.

2. round → R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)  
   – O is NOT in position 2 (it already knew it’s in position 3, so this is redundant).  
   – R is NOT in position 1.  
   – U, N, D are absent.

So far:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- R must be in position 3 or 4 (but 3 is already O), so R must be in position 4.
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, U, N, D.
- Still-allowed common letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Has O in position 3.  
- Has R in position 4.  
- Introduces new consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.

A good candidate is “FORGY”:
- F, G, Y are new letters.  
- O in position 3, R in position 4.  
- No forbidden letters.

But “FORGY” is uncommon. A more common word with the same pattern is “CROAK”:
- C, K are new.  
- O in 3, R in 4.  
- A is forbidden, so that won’t work.

Next candidate: “BORIC” – but C and I are allowed, but R is in 4, O in 3.  
“BORIC” has R in position 4, O in position 3.  
Letters: B, O, R, I, C – none of which are forbidden.

This seems valid.

Let’s go with “boric”.

Let’s update what we now know after four guesses.

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is fixed in position 3.  
   – R exists somewhere, but NOT in position 2.

2. round → R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)  
   – R is NOT in position 1.  
   – O is NOT in position 2 (redundant since we know it’s in position 3).  
   – U, N, D are absent.

3. boric → B(x) O(-) R(-) I(x) C(x)  
   – B, I, C are absent.  
   – O is NOT in position 2 (again redundant).  
   – R is NOT in position 4.

So far:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- R must be in position 1 or 3 or 5.  But position 3 is O, so R must be in position 1 or 5.
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, U, N, D, B, I, C.

Remaining common letters: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, W, Y, plus the vowels we haven’t tested: none left (A, E, I, O, U are partially ruled out).

Let’s try R in position 1: R _ O _ _  
A common word starting with R and having O in position 3 is “RHOXY” – but X is rare.  
Another is “ROGER” – but G and E are allowed? E is forbidden.  
“ROGER” fails because E is forbidden.

Next, try R in position 5: _ _ O _ R  
Common words: “FLOUR” – F, L, U, R.  U is forbidden.  
“GLOOM” – no R.  
“HOLLY” – no R.  
“MOLLY” – no R.  
“POLAR” – A is forbidden.  
“TROOP” – O is in position 3, but P and T are allowed.  
“TROOP” has O in position 3 and R in position 5.  
Letters: T, R, O, O, P – but O appears twice, and we don’t know if duplicates are allowed.  
Also, T and P haven’t been tested yet.

Another candidate: “GROUT” – but U is forbidden.  
“CROAK” – C is forbidden.  
“FROST” – S is forbidden.  
“FROCK” – C is forbidden.  
“GROIN” – N is forbidden.  
“GROUT” – U is forbidden.  
“HORNY” – H, R, O, N, Y.  N is forbidden.  
“HORNY” fails.  
“HORSE” – S and E are forbidden.  
“HORSE” fails.  
“MORPH” – M, O, R, P, H.  All letters allowed so far.  
“MORPH” has O in position 3 and R in position 4 – but earlier feedback says R is NOT in position 4 (from boric feedback).  
So “MORPH” is invalid because R would be in position 4.

Next, “MOTOR” – T and O are allowed, but O appears twice.  
“MOTOR” has R in position 5.  
Letters: M, O, T, O, R – no forbidden letters.  
This seems valid.

Let’s go with “motor”.

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is fixed in position 3.  
   – R exists but NOT in position 2.

2. round → R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)  
   – R is NOT in position 1.  
   – O is NOT in position 2 (redundant).  
   – U, N, D are absent.

3. boric → B(x) O(-) R(-) I(x) C(x)  
   – B, I, C are absent.  
   – R is NOT in position 4.

4. motor → M(✓) O(-) T(x) O(-) R(✓)  
   – M is correct in position 1.  
   – R is correct in position 5.  
   – O is NOT in positions 2 or 4 (redundant).  
   – T is absent.

So the pattern is now fully determined:  
M _ O _ R

Forbidden letters so far: A, S, E, U, N, D, B, I, C, T.  
Allowed remaining letters: F, G, H, K, L, P, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with M, has O in position 3, ends with R, and uses only allowed letters in positions 2 and 4.

Possible middle letters for position 2: F, G, H, K, L, P, W, Y  
Possible middle letters for position 4: F, G, H, K, L, P, W, Y (but must form a valid word)

Let’s list valid English words fitting M _ O _ R:
- M O O R → too short.
- M F O _ R → MFOFR is not a word.
- M G O _ R → MGORS is not a word.
- M H O _ R → MHOHR is not a word.
- M P O _ R → MPOR_ is not a word.
- M W O _ R → MWOR_ is not a word.
- M Y O _ R → MYOR_ is not a word.

Looking at common words:
- M O O R is 4 letters.
- M O R S H is 5 letters but S is forbidden.
- M O R S A L is 6 letters.
- M O R R I S is 6 letters and has I and S (both forbidden).
- M O R R Y is 5 letters and has Y (allowed) but double R which may or may not be allowed.
- M O R R Y – letters M, O, R, R, Y.  R appears twice.  We don’t have info against duplicates, so this could be possible.

Another candidate: M O R P H – but this has H in position 4 and P in position 2, but it would be M O R P H – but this doesn’t end with R.

Wait, we need M _ O _ R.  Let me think differently.

Looking for 5-letter words: M _ O _ R
- M O O R is 4 letters.
- M O R S H – S forbidden.
- M O R R Y – Y is allowed, double R may be allowed.
- M O R P H – doesn’t end with R.
- M O R R I – I forbidden.
- M O R R Y seems the only valid candidate.

But is M O R R Y a valid English word?  Yes, it means “merry” or “good-humored”.

Letters: M, O, R, R, Y – none of which are forbidden.  R appears twice, but we have no information against duplicates.

Therefore, the next logical guess is M O R R Y.
