### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us coverage of 3 consonants and 2 vowels, which should help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all (x).
- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

We now know:
- Letters to exclude: C, R, A.
- Letters to include: N, E (somewhere else).

Next, we want a word that:
1. Uses N and E in different positions.
2. Avoids C, R, A.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good candidate letters to try next: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, O, I, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try “STONE”:
- S, T, O, N, E.
- It uses N and E in new positions (N in 4, E in 5 – but we already know E is not in 5, so this is risky).

Better: “UNTIE” – but U is less common.

Better still: “UNTIL” – but L is less common.

Another candidate: “ELBOW” – uses E in 1, L, B, O, W. But lacks N.

We must include N and E in new positions. Let’s try “NEONS”:
- N in 1, E in 2, O, N, S.
- But N repeats and we’re not sure if it’s allowed.

Better: “ENEMY” – E in 1, N in 2, E in 3 (repeats), M, Y. Repeats E.

Better: “NEMESIS” – too long.

Better: “NEWLY” – N, E, W, L, Y. But lacks N in new position.

Let’s try “NEEDY” – N, E, E, D, Y. Repeats E.

Let’s try “NUTTY” – lacks E.

Let’s try “ENTRE” – uses E, N, T, R, E. But R is excluded.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, D, O, W.
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): N, E.

Positions we have tried so far:
- N was in position 2 (Guess 2) and position 4 (Guess 1) – both marked “-”.
- E was in position 5 (Guess 1) and position 1 (Guess 2) – both marked “-”.

So:
- N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both N and E.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, D, O, W.
- Places N and E in positions we haven’t tried yet.

Remaining common letters we can use: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, T, U, V, Y, etc.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is “LEMON”:
- L, E, M, O, N – but O is excluded.
Next: “PENNY” – P, E, N, N, Y. Uses N twice and E once. Positions: E in 2, N in 3 and 5. This is acceptable because:
  – E is in position 2 (new position).
  – N is in positions 3 and 5 (both new positions).
  – Letters used: P, E, N, Y. None of C, R, A, D, O, W appear.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us coverage of 3 consonants and 2 vowels, which should help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all (x).
- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

We now know:
- Letters to exclude: C, R, A.
- Letters to include: N, E (somewhere else).

Next, we want a word that:
1. Uses N and E in different positions.
2. Avoids C, R, A.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good candidate letters to try next: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, O, I, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try “STONE”:
- S, T, O, N, E.
- It uses N and E in new positions (N in 4, E in 5 – but we already know E is not in 5, so this is risky).

Better: “UNTIE” – but U is less common.

Better still: “UNTIL” – but L is less common.

Another candidate: “ELBOW” – uses E in 1, L, B, O, W. But lacks N.

We must include N and E in new positions. Let’s try “NEONS”:
- N in 1, E in 2, O, N, S.
- But N repeats and we’re not sure if it’s allowed.

Better: “ENEMY” – E in 1, N in 2, E in 3 (repeats), M, Y. Repeats E.

Better: “NEMESIS” – too long.

Better: “NEWLY” – N, E, W, L, Y. But lacks N in new position.

Let’s try “NEEDY” – N, E, E, D, Y. Repeats E.

Let’s try “NUTTY” – lacks E.

Let’s try “ENTRE” – uses E, N, T, R, E. But R is excluded.

Let’s try “ENEMY” – already considered.

Let’s try “NILE” – too short.

Let’s try “ENIGMA” – too long.

Let’s try “ENEMY” – already considered.

Let’s try “ELENA” – uses E, L, E, N, A. But A is excluded.

Let’s try “ELDER” – R excluded.

Let’s try “ELBOW” – already considered.

Let’s try “ELUDE” – E, L, U, D, E. Lacks N.

Let’s try “ENDOW” – E, N, D, O, W. Uses N and E in new positions (E in 1, N in 2). Avoids C, R, A.

This seems good:
- E in 1 (new position).
- N in 2 (new position).
- D, O, W are new letters to test.

So the guess: ENDOW

1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, D, O, W.
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): N, E.

Positions we have tried so far:
- N was in position 2 (Guess 2) and position 4 (Guess 1) – both marked “-”.
- E was in position 5 (Guess 1) and position 1 (Guess 2) – both marked “-”.

So:
- N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both N and E.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, D, O, W.
- Places N and E in positions we haven’t tried yet.

Remaining common letters we can use: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, T, U, V, Y, etc.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is “LEMON”:
- L, E, M, O, N – but O is excluded.
Next: “PENNY” – P, E, N, N, Y. Uses N twice and E once. Positions: E in 2, N in 3 and 5. This is acceptable because:
  – E is in position 2 (new position).
  – N is in positions 3 and 5 (both new positions).
  – Letters used: P, E, N, Y. None of C, R, A, D, O, W appear.

From the new feedback on PENNY:

- P(x) → P is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- N(✓) → N is in the word AND in position 3 (correct).
- N(-) → N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (we already know it’s in 3, so this is consistent).
- Y(x) → Y is NOT in the word.

Summary of what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, D, O, W, P, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: N (fixed in position 3), E (somewhere else).

Positions:
- Position 3 is N.
- E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5 (because it was wrong in 1 and 2, and we haven’t tried 4 yet).  
  So E must be in position 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ N E _

Letters still allowed: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, S, T, U, V, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ _ N E _ using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BINGE – but G is allowed, but I is allowed, B is allowed. However, we need to check if all letters are allowed. B, I, N, G, E – all allowed except G hasn’t been tested yet, but it’s allowed. But let’s see if there’s a simpler one.
- HINGE – H, I, N, G, E – same issue.
- STING – S, T, I, N, G – but E is missing.
- BINGE, HINGE, STING, etc. all fit _ _ N E _ with allowed letters.

But we need to include E in position 4 and N in position 3. The simplest word that fits is:

BINGE – B, I, N, G, E – but we haven’t tested G yet, but it’s allowed.

However, let’s think of a word that uses common letters and fits. A good candidate is “STING” – but it lacks E. We need E in position 4.

So the pattern is _ _ N E _. The word must be _ _ N E _.

Possible words:
- BINGE – but we haven’t tested G yet, but it’s allowed.
- HINGE – same.
- STING – no E.
- BINGE is valid.

But let’s think of simpler words. How about “MINER”? But R is excluded.

“MINER” – R excluded.

“MINED” – D excluded.

“MINES” – S allowed, E in 4, N in 3. This fits: M, I, N, E, S. All letters allowed (M, I, N, E, S).

Yes, “MINES” fits the pattern _ _ N E _ with N in position 3 and E in position 4, and uses allowed letters.

Let’s verify:
- M – allowed (not excluded)
- I – allowed (not excluded)
- N – correct position 3
- E – must be in position 4 (we haven’t tried it here)
- S – allowed (not excluded)

So “MINES” is a valid next guess.

- BINGE – but G is allowed, but I is allowed, B is allowed. However, we need to check if all letters are allowed. B, I, N, G, E – all allowed except G hasn’t been tested yet, but it’s allowed. But let’s see if there’s a simpler one.
- HINGE – H, I, N, G, E – same issue.
- STING – S, T, I, N, G – but E is missing.
- BINGE, HINGE, STING, etc. all fit _ _ N E _ with allowed letters.

But we need to include E in position 4 and N in position 3. The simplest word that fits is:

BINGE – B, I, N, G, E – but we haven’t tested G yet, but it’s allowed.

However, let’s think of a word that uses common letters and fits. A good candidate is “STING” – but it lacks E. We need E in position 4.

So the pattern is _ _ N E _. The word must be _ _ N E _.

Possible words:
- BINGE – but we haven’t tested G yet, but it’s allowed.
- HINGE – same.
- STING – no E.
- BINGE is valid.

But let’s think of simpler words. How about “MINER”? But R is excluded.

“MINER” – R excluded.

“MINED” – D excluded.

“MINES” – S allowed, E in 4, N in 3. This fits: M, I, N, E, S. All letters allowed (M, I, N, E, S).

Yes, “MINES” fits the pattern _ _ N E _ with N in position 3 and E in position 4, and uses allowed letters.

Let’s verify:
- M – allowed (not excluded)
- I – allowed (not excluded)
- N – correct position 3
- E – must be in position 4 (we haven’t tried it here)
- S – allowed (not excluded)

So “MINES” is a valid next guess.

So the secret word has the fixed pattern:

Therefore the word looks like: _ _ N E _

Letters we have eliminated so far:

Remaining possible letters (common ones): B, F, G, H, K, L, T, U, V

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ _ N E _ using only these remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- BINGE – but I is eliminated.
- HINGE – I is eliminated.
- KNEEL – L is allowed, but K and L are allowed. However, this has two Es (position 4 is E, but position 5 is L, so it would be K N E E L – but we know E is only in position 4, so this is invalid.
- BLENDED – too long.
- TUNNE – but U is allowed, T is allowed, N is in 3, E is in 4. But this has two Ns (position 3 and 5), which might be possible, but we need to check if T, U, N, E are allowed. T and U are allowed, N and E are already known.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us coverage of 3 consonants and 2 vowels, which should help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all (x).
- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

We now know:
- Letters to exclude: C, R, A.
- Letters to include: N, E (somewhere else).

Next, we want a word that:
1. Uses N and E in different positions.
2. Avoids C, R, A.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good candidate letters to try next: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, O, I, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try “STONE”:
- S, T, O, N, E.
- It uses N and E in new positions (N in 4, E in 5 – but we already know E is not in 5, so this is risky).

Better: “UNTIE” – but U is less common.

Better still: “UNTIL” – but L is less common.

Another candidate: “ELBOW” – uses E in 1, L, B, O, W. But lacks N.

We must include N and E in new positions. Let’s try “NEONS”:
- N in 1, E in 2, O, N, S.
- But N repeats and we’re not sure if it’s allowed.

Better: “ENEMY” – E in 1, N in 2, E in 3 (repeats), M, Y. Repeats E.

Better: “NEMESIS” – too long.

Better: “NEWLY” – N, E, W, L, Y. But lacks N in new position.

Let’s try “NEEDY” – N, E, E, D, Y. Repeats E.

Let’s try “NUTTY” – lacks E.

Let’s try “ENTRE” – uses E, N, T, R, E. But R is excluded.

Let’s try “ENEMY” – already considered.

Let’s try “NILE” – too short.

Let’s try “ENIGMA” – too long.

Let’s try “ENEMY” – already considered.

Let’s try “ELENA” – uses E, L, E, N, A. But A is excluded.

Let’s try “ELDER” – R excluded.

Let’s try “ELBOW” – already considered.

Let’s try “ELUDE” – E, L, U, D, E. Lacks N.

Let’s try “ENDOW” – E, N, D, O, W. Uses N and E in new positions (E in 1, N in 2). Avoids C, R, A.

This seems good:
- E in 1 (new position).
- N in 2 (new position).
- D, O, W are new letters to test.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, D, O, W.
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): N, E.

Positions we have tried so far:
- N was in position 2 (Guess 2) and position 4 (Guess 1) – both marked “-”.
- E was in position 5 (Guess 1) and position 1 (Guess 2) – both marked “-”.

So:
- N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both N and E.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, D, O, W.
- Places N and E in positions we haven’t tried yet.

Remaining common letters we can use: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, S, T, U, V, Y, etc.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is “LEMON”:
- L, E, M, O, N – but O is excluded.
Next: “PENNY” – P, E, N, N, Y. Uses N twice and E once. Positions: E in 2, N in 3 and 5. This is acceptable because:
  – E is in position 2 (new position).
  – N is in positions 3 and 5 (both new positions).
  – Letters used: P, E, N, Y. None of C, R, A, D, O, W appear.

“PENNY” is a valid 5-letter word and meets all constraints.

Summary of what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, D, O, W, P, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: N (fixed in position 3), E (somewhere else).

Positions:
- Position 3 is N.
- E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5 (because it was wrong in 1 and 2, and we haven’t tried 4 yet).  
  So E must be in position 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ N E _

Letters still allowed: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, S, T, U, V, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ _ N E _ using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BINGE – but G is allowed, but I is allowed, B is allowed. However, we need to check if all letters are allowed. B, I, N, G, E – all allowed except G hasn’t been tested yet, but it’s allowed. But let’s see if there’s a simpler one.
- HINGE – H, I, N, G, E – same issue.
- STING – S, T, I, N, G – but E is missing.
- BINGE, HINGE, STING, etc. all fit _ _ N E _ with allowed letters.

But we need to include E in position 4 and N in position 3. The simplest word that fits is:

BINGE – B, I, N, G, E – but we haven’t tested G yet, but it’s allowed.

However, let’s think of a word that uses common letters and fits. A good candidate is “STING” – but it lacks E. We need E in position 4.

So the pattern is _ _ N E _. The word must be _ _ N E _.

Possible words:
- BINGE – but we haven’t tested G yet, but it’s allowed.
- HINGE – same.
- STING – no E.
- BINGE is valid.

But let’s think of simpler words. How about “MINER”? But R is excluded.

“MINER” – R excluded.

“MINED” – D excluded.

“MINES” – S allowed, E in 4, N in 3. This fits: M, I, N, E, S. All letters allowed (M, I, N, E, S).

Yes, “MINES” fits the pattern _ _ N E _ with N in position 3 and E in position 4, and uses allowed letters.

Let’s verify:
- M – allowed (not excluded)
- I – allowed (not excluded)
- N – correct position 3
- E – must be in position 4 (we haven’t tried it here)
- S – allowed (not excluded)

So “MINES” is a valid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on MINES:

- M(x) → M is NOT in the word.
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- N(✓) → N is in the word AND in position 3 (already known).
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in position 4 (already known).
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.

So the secret word has the fixed pattern:
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: E

Therefore the word looks like: _ _ N E _

Letters we have eliminated so far:
C, R, A, D, O, W, P, Y, M, I, S

Remaining possible letters (common ones): B, F, G, H, K, L, T, U, V

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ _ N E _ using only these remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- BINGE – but I is eliminated.
- HINGE – I is eliminated.
- KNEEL – L is allowed, but K and L are allowed. However, this has two Es (position 4 is E, but position 5 is L, so it would be K N E E L – but we know E is only in position 4, so this is invalid.
- BLENDED – too long.
- TUNNE – but U is allowed, T is allowed, N is in 3, E is in 4. But this has two Ns (position 3 and 5), which might be possible, but we need to check if T, U, N, E are allowed. T and U are allowed, N and E are already known.
- TUNNE – but this is not a common word.
- BUNNE – not common.
- FUDGE – but D is eliminated.
- HUNTER – R is eliminated.
- TUNER – R is eliminated.
- TUNNE – seems to be the closest.

Wait, let's think of common words:
- TUNNE – not common.
- BUNNE – not common.
- HUNNE – not common.
- GUNNE – not common.
- KUNNE – not common.

Actually, let's think differently: we need _ _ N E _ with remaining letters.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 2: B, F, G, H, K, L, T, U, V

Possible letters for position 5: B, F, G, H, K, L, T, U, V

Let's list possible combinations:
- B _ N E _ : B, _, N, E, _ → BLEN? No, L is allowed. BLEN? Not a word. BUN? No.
- F _ N E _ : F, _, N, E, _ → FUDGE – D is eliminated.
- G _ N E _ : G, _, N, E, _ → GUNNE – not a word.
- H _ N E _ : H, _, N, E, _ → HUNNE – not a word.
- K _ N E _ : K, _, N, E, _ → KNEEL – but L is allowed, but this has K N E E L – but E is only in position 4, so this is invalid (two Es).
- L _ N E _ : L, _, N, E, _ → LUNGE – G is allowed, U is allowed. LUNGE fits: L, U, N, G, E. But we need _ _ N E _, so positions: 1=L, 2=U, 3=N, 4=E, 5=G. This fits perfectly.
- T _ N E _ : T, _, N, E, _ → TUNNE – not a word. TONNE – O is eliminated.
- U _ N E _ : U, _, N, E, _ → UNENE – not a word.
- V _ N E _ : V, _, N, E, _ → VUNNE – not a word.

The only common word that fits is LUNGE. Let's verify:
- L – allowed
- U – allowed
- N – position 3 (correct)
- G – allowed
- E – position 4 (correct)

LUNGE is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

But we already have E in position 4 from earlier feedback, so this is consistent. Therefore, the word must be L U N E _, and the only possible letter left is one that hasn't been eliminated.
