For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should ideally use 5 distinct letters from this set. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's a well-balanced first guess covering several very common letters.

- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

Let's try to place L and A in new positions and fill the rest with common unused letters. A word like ""CLAMP"" uses C, L, A, M, P - all common and none of the excluded letters. It also moves L from position 2 to 3 and A from 3 to 2, satisfying the ""wrong position"" constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E, C, P  
Letters that ARE in the word: L, A, M  
Positions we can rule out for L: 2 (from SLATE), 2 (from CLAMP) → still 2  
Positions we can rule out for A: 3 (from SLATE), 3 (from CLAMP) → still 3  
Position we know is correct for M: 4

So the word must be of the form: _ _ _ M _  
It must contain L and A, and L cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3.

We also know it cannot contain S, T, E, C, P.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: R, N, I, O, D, U, B, G, H, K, etc.

We need to place L and A in the remaining three slots (positions 1, 2, 3, 5) while respecting their positional bans.

Let’s try to construct a word:

- M is fixed at position 4.
- We need one more letter for positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- We still need to place L and A somewhere.

One straightforward arrangement is to put A in position 1 and L in position 3 (since L can’t be in 2 and A can’t be in 3). This gives: A _ L M _

We need a single letter for position 2. From the unused pool, R, N, I, O, D, U, B, G, H, K are still possible. Let’s pick R as it’s common.

So the word would be: A R L M _  
We still need a 5th letter for position 5. From the unused pool, let’s try D.

This gives: A R L M D → “ARLMD” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Let’s try another arrangement. How about putting L in position 1 and A in position 2: L A _ M _  
We need a letter for position 3 and 5. Let’s try N and D: L A N M D → “LANMD” – invalid.

Another arrangement: L in position 1, A in position 5: L _ _ M A  
We need letters for positions 2 and 3. Let’s try R and N: L R N M A → “LRNMA” – invalid.

Let’s try A in position 2 and L in position 5: _ A _ M L  
We need letters for positions 1 and 3. Let’s try R and N: R A N M L → “RANML” – invalid.

Let’s try A in position 1 and L in position 5: A _ _ M L  
We need letters for positions 2 and 3. Let’s try R and N: A R N M L → “AR N M L” – invalid.

Let’s try a different approach. We need a valid word that fits _ _ _ M _ and contains both L and A, with L not in 2 and A not in 3.

Looking at valid English words ending in M...  
- “BLANK” – but we know C, P, S, T, E are out, but N, K are allowed.  
- “FLANK” – F is allowed (not ruled out).  
- “GLAND” – G, N, D are allowed.  
- “PLANK” – P is ruled out.  
- “SLANG” – S is ruled out.

“FLANK” seems promising: F, L, A, N, K – none of the forbidden letters (S,T,E,C,P), and it places L in position 2 (but L cannot be in 2), so this is invalid.

“GLAND” – G, L, A, N, D – L is in position 2 (invalid).

“BLANK” – B, L, A, N, K – L is in position 2 (invalid).

“ALARM” – A, L, A, R, M – contains A twice, but we don’t know if A is duplicated; also L is in position 2 (invalid).

“BALMY” – B, A, L, M, Y – L is in position 3 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed), M is in position 4 (correct). This seems valid.

Check letters: B, A, L, M, Y – none of S,T,E,C,P are present.  
Positions: L is in 3 (allowed), A is in 2 (allowed), M is in 4 (correct).

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should ideally use 5 distinct letters from this set. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters NOT present: S, T, E
- Letters present but misplaced: L, A (each appears once)

We need a word that:
1. Contains both L and A
2. Does NOT contain S, T, or E
3. Has L not in position 2 and A not in position 3

Good candidate letters to try next: R, N, I, O, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's try to place L and A in new positions and fill the rest with common unused letters. A word like ""CLAMP"" uses C, L, A, M, P - all common and none of the excluded letters. It also moves L from position 2 to 3 and A from 3 to 2, satisfying the ""wrong position"" constraints.

Another check: ""CLAMP"" - C, L, A, M, P - no S, T, E, and L/A are in new spots. Seems good.

Guess 2: CLAMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) A(-) M(✓) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E, C, P  
Letters that ARE in the word: L, A, M  
Positions we can rule out for L: 2 (from SLATE), 2 (from CLAMP) → still 2  
Positions we can rule out for A: 3 (from SLATE), 3 (from CLAMP) → still 3  
Position we know is correct for M: 4

So the word must be of the form: _ _ _ M _  
It must contain L and A, and L cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3.

We also know it cannot contain S, T, E, C, P.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: R, N, I, O, D, U, B, G, H, K, etc.

We need to place L and A in the remaining three slots (positions 1, 2, 3, 5) while respecting their positional bans.

Let’s try to construct a word:

- M is fixed at position 4.
- We need one more letter for positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- We still need to place L and A somewhere.

One straightforward arrangement is to put A in position 1 and L in position 3 (since L can’t be in 2 and A can’t be in 3). This gives: A _ L M _

We need a single letter for position 2. From the unused pool, R, N, I, O, D, U, B, G, H, K are still possible. Let’s pick R as it’s common.

So the word would be: A R L M _  
We still need a 5th letter for position 5. From the unused pool, let’s try D.

This gives: A R L M D → “ARLMD” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Let’s try another arrangement. How about putting L in position 1 and A in position 2: L A _ M _  
We need a letter for position 3 and 5. Let’s try N and D: L A N M D → “LANMD” – invalid.

Another arrangement: L in position 1, A in position 5: L _ _ M A  
We need letters for positions 2 and 3. Let’s try R and N: L R N M A → “LRNMA” – invalid.

Let’s try A in position 2 and L in position 5: _ A _ M L  
We need letters for positions 1 and 3. Let’s try R and N: R A N M L → “RANML” – invalid.

Let’s try A in position 1 and L in position 5: A _ _ M L  
We need letters for positions 2 and 3. Let’s try R and N: A R N M L → “AR N M L” – invalid.

Let’s try a different approach. We need a valid word that fits _ _ _ M _ and contains both L and A, with L not in 2 and A not in 3.

Looking at valid English words ending in M...  
- “BLANK” – but we know C, P, S, T, E are out, but N, K are allowed.  
- “FLANK” – F is allowed (not ruled out).  
- “GLAND” – G, N, D are allowed.  
- “PLANK” – P is ruled out.  
- “SLANG” – S is ruled out.

“FLANK” seems promising: F, L, A, N, K – none of the forbidden letters (S,T,E,C,P), and it places L in position 2 (but L cannot be in 2), so this is invalid.

“GLAND” – G, L, A, N, D – L is in position 2 (invalid).

“BLANK” – B, L, A, N, K – L is in position 2 (invalid).

“ALARM” – A, L, A, R, M – contains A twice, but we don’t know if A is duplicated; also L is in position 2 (invalid).

“BALMY” – B, A, L, M, Y – L is in position 3 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed), M is in position 4 (correct). This seems valid.

Check letters: B, A, L, M, Y – none of S,T,E,C,P are present.  
Positions: L is in 3 (allowed), A is in 2 (allowed), M is in 4 (correct).

“BALMY” is a valid English word.

Let’s use BALMY.

Let's consolidate everything we now know.

Letters we have ruled out (x in any position):  
S, T, E, C, P, B

Letters we know are in the word (✓ or - in some position):  
A (now known to be in position 2),  
L (must appear somewhere, but not in position 2 or 3),  
M (must be in position 4),  
Y (must appear somewhere).

So the word has the pattern:  
_ A _ M _  
and must contain L and Y, with L not in 2 or 3 and Y not yet placed.

Possible positions for L: 1 or 5 (since 2 and 3 are banned).  
Possible positions for Y: 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 is A and 4 is M).

We need a valid English word that fits _ A _ M _ and includes both L and Y.

Let's list possibilities:

1. L in position 1: L A _ M _  
   We need Y in position 3 or 5.  
   - L A Y M _ → LAYM_ → ""LAYMN"" is invalid, ""LAYMO"" is invalid, etc.  
   - L A _ M Y → L A _ M Y → ""LAMBY"" – this is a valid word (variant spelling of ""lamby"" meaning small or modest).

2. L in position 5: _ A _ M L  
   We need Y in position 1 or 3.  
   - Y A _ M L → ""YAML_"" – invalid.  
   - _ A Y M L → ""GAYML"" – invalid, ""DAYML"" – invalid, etc.  
   No valid English words here.

Therefore, the only valid candidate is ""LAMBY"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should ideally use 5 distinct letters from this set. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's a well-balanced first guess covering several very common letters.

From the feedback so far we know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, E, C, P, B  
- Letters that ARE in the word and in their exact positions:  
  L (position 1), A (position 2), M (position 4), Y (position 5)  
- Therefore the word must be: L A _ M Y  
- The only missing letter is the third one.  
- From the remaining unused letters (common English letters not yet ruled out): R, N, I, O, D, U, G, H, K, etc.  
- We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with L, has A in position 2, ends with MY, and has one letter in position 3.  
- The only common English word that fits is L A R M Y → “LARMY” – but that’s not a valid word.  
- Next possibility: L A N M Y → “LANMY” – invalid.  
- L A R M Y – invalid.  
- L A I M Y – invalid.  
- L A D M Y – invalid.  
- L A G M Y – invalid.  
- L A H M Y – invalid.  
- L A K M Y – invalid.  
- L A O M Y – invalid.  
- L A U M Y – invalid.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should ideally use 5 distinct letters from this set. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's a well-balanced first guess covering several very common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters NOT present: S, T, E
- Letters present but misplaced: L, A (each appears once)

We need a word that:
1. Contains both L and A
2. Does NOT contain S, T, or E
3. Has L not in position 2 and A not in position 3

Good candidate letters to try next: R, N, I, O, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's try to place L and A in new positions and fill the rest with common unused letters. A word like ""CLAMP"" uses C, L, A, M, P - all common and none of the excluded letters. It also moves L from position 2 to 3 and A from 3 to 2, satisfying the ""wrong position"" constraints.

Another check: ""CLAMP"" - C, L, A, M, P - no S, T, E, and L/A are in new spots. Seems good.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CLAMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) A(-) M(✓) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E, C, P  
Letters that ARE in the word: L, A, M  
Positions we can rule out for L: 2 (from SLATE), 2 (from CLAMP) → still 2  
Positions we can rule out for A: 3 (from SLATE), 3 (from CLAMP) → still 3  
Position we know is correct for M: 4

So the word must be of the form: _ _ _ M _  
It must contain L and A, and L cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3.

We also know it cannot contain S, T, E, C, P.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: R, N, I, O, D, U, B, G, H, K, etc.

We need to place L and A in the remaining three slots (positions 1, 2, 3, 5) while respecting their positional bans.

Let’s try to construct a word:

- M is fixed at position 4.
- We need one more letter for positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- We still need to place L and A somewhere.

One straightforward arrangement is to put A in position 1 and L in position 3 (since L can’t be in 2 and A can’t be in 3). This gives: A _ L M _

We need a single letter for position 2. From the unused pool, R, N, I, O, D, U, B, G, H, K are still possible. Let’s pick R as it’s common.

So the word would be: A R L M _  
We still need a 5th letter for position 5. From the unused pool, let’s try D.

This gives: A R L M D → “ARLMD” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Let’s try another arrangement. How about putting L in position 1 and A in position 2: L A _ M _  
We need a letter for position 3 and 5. Let’s try N and D: L A N M D → “LANMD” – invalid.

Another arrangement: L in position 1, A in position 5: L _ _ M A  
We need letters for positions 2 and 3. Let’s try R and N: L R N M A → “LRNMA” – invalid.

Let’s try A in position 2 and L in position 5: _ A _ M L  
We need letters for positions 1 and 3. Let’s try R and N: R A N M L → “RANML” – invalid.

Let’s try A in position 1 and L in position 5: A _ _ M L  
We need letters for positions 2 and 3. Let’s try R and N: A R N M L → “AR N M L” – invalid.

Let’s try a different approach. We need a valid word that fits _ _ _ M _ and contains both L and A, with L not in 2 and A not in 3.

Looking at valid English words ending in M...  
- “BLANK” – but we know C, P, S, T, E are out, but N, K are allowed.  
- “FLANK” – F is allowed (not ruled out).  
- “GLAND” – G, N, D are allowed.  
- “PLANK” – P is ruled out.  
- “SLANG” – S is ruled out.

“FLANK” seems promising: F, L, A, N, K – none of the forbidden letters (S,T,E,C,P), and it places L in position 2 (but L cannot be in 2), so this is invalid.

“GLAND” – G, L, A, N, D – L is in position 2 (invalid).

“BLANK” – B, L, A, N, K – L is in position 2 (invalid).

“ALARM” – A, L, A, R, M – contains A twice, but we don’t know if A is duplicated; also L is in position 2 (invalid).

“BALMY” – B, A, L, M, Y – L is in position 3 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed), M is in position 4 (correct). This seems valid.

Check letters: B, A, L, M, Y – none of S,T,E,C,P are present.  
Positions: L is in 3 (allowed), A is in 2 (allowed), M is in 4 (correct).

“BALMY” is a valid English word.

Let’s use BALMY.

Let's consolidate everything we now know.

Letters we have ruled out (x in any position):  
S, T, E, C, P, B

Letters we know are in the word (✓ or - in some position):  
A (now known to be in position 2),  
L (must appear somewhere, but not in position 2 or 3),  
M (must be in position 4),  
Y (must appear somewhere).

So the word has the pattern:  
_ A _ M _  
and must contain L and Y, with L not in 2 or 3 and Y not yet placed.

Possible positions for L: 1 or 5 (since 2 and 3 are banned).  
Possible positions for Y: 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 is A and 4 is M).

We need a valid English word that fits _ A _ M _ and includes both L and Y.

Let's list possibilities:

1. L in position 1: L A _ M _  
   We need Y in position 3 or 5.  
   - L A Y M _ → LAYM_ → ""LAYMN"" is invalid, ""LAYMO"" is invalid, etc.  
   - L A _ M Y → L A _ M Y → ""LAMBY"" – this is a valid word (variant spelling of ""lamby"" meaning small or modest).

2. L in position 5: _ A _ M L  
   We need Y in position 1 or 3.  
   - Y A _ M L → ""YAML_"" – invalid.  
   - _ A Y M L → ""GAYML"" – invalid, ""DAYML"" – invalid, etc.  
   No valid English words here.

Therefore, the only valid candidate is ""LAMBY"".
