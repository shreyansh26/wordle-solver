For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these. 

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it can’t be in position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

We now know:
- The word contains S somewhere other than the first letter.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, or E.

To maximize information on the next guess, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Places S in a new position (2-5).
2. Uses other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.

Good candidates:
- CRISP (but P isn’t super common)
- ROSES (but E is ruled out)
- SPURN (but U is less common)
- SHORN (but N is less common)

A strong choice is “SHORN”:
- S is now in position 2.
- Uses H, O, R, N – all common letters not yet ruled out.
- Contains O (a vowel) and R, N (common consonants).

This should tell us where S fits and give info on H, O, R, N.

From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SHORN → S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1 (confirmed).
   - H, O, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.

Letters known to be in the word: S, R  
Letters known NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, O, N

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and R.
- Does NOT contain any of the excluded letters.
- Places S somewhere other than position 1.
- Places R somewhere other than position 4.

Possible placements:
- S could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- R could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Let’s brainstorm words fitting these constraints:
- SCUBA – contains A (excluded)
- SCARF – contains A (excluded)
- SCRUB – contains U (allowed), but B is less common
- SPROU – contains O (excluded)
- SPRIG – contains I and G, but P is allowed
- SUGAR – contains U and A (A excluded)
- SWIRL – contains W, I, R, L (L excluded)
- SQUID – contains U, Q, I, D
- SCRUM – contains C, U, M
- SCRIP – contains C, I, P
- SPRY – too short
- SRI – too short
- SCURF – contains F

A good candidate is ""SCRUB"":
- Contains S and R.
- Uses C, U, B (all allowed).
- S is in position 1 – wait, that’s not allowed (S can’t be in position 1).

Next candidate: ""SCRIP""
- Contains S, C, R, I, P.
- S is in position 1 – again not allowed.

Next: ""SPRIG""
- S in position 1 – again not allowed.

Next: ""SRI"" (this is the 7th time I’ve tried SRI, but I realize I’m stuck in a loop).  
Let me pick a different word that avoids the excluded letters and places S and R in new positions.

Good candidate: “CURVS” – but V is less common and U is allowed, but let’s check letters: C, U, R, V, S.  
- C, U, R, V, S – none are excluded.  
- S is in position 5 (new position).  
- R is in position 3 (new position).  

This seems valid.

Another candidate: “SURFS” – S in 1 (invalid).  
“FRISK” – F, R, I, S, K – all allowed, S in 4, R in 2.  

I’ll go with “FRISK” as it uses common letters and tests new positions for S and R.

</think>

<guess>FRISK</guess>",FRISK,"From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SHORN → S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1 (confirmed).
   - H, O, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.

Letters known to be in the word: S, R  
Letters known NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, O, N

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and R.
- Does NOT contain any of the excluded letters.
- Places S somewhere other than position 1.
- Places R somewhere other than position 4.

Possible placements:
- S could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- R could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Let’s brainstorm words fitting these constraints:
- SCUBA – contains A (excluded)
- SCARF – contains A (excluded)
- SCRUB – contains U (allowed), but B is less common
- SPROU – contains O (excluded)
- SPRIG – contains I and G, but P is allowed
- SUGAR – contains U and A (A excluded)
- SWIRL – contains W, I, R, L (L excluded)
- SQUID – contains U, Q, I, D
- SCRUM – contains C, U, M
- SCRIP – contains C, I, P
- SPRY – too short
- SRI – too short
- SCURF – contains F

A good candidate is ""SCRUB"":
- Contains S and R.
- Uses C, U, B (all allowed).
- S is in position 1 – wait, that’s not allowed (S can’t be in position 1).

Next candidate: ""SCRIP""
- Contains S, C, R, I, P.
- S is in position 1 – again not allowed.

Next: ""SPRIG""
- S in position 1 – again not allowed.

Next: ""SQUID""
- S in position 1 – again not allowed.

Next: ""SUGAR"" – A excluded.

Next: ""SWIRL"" – L excluded.

Next: ""SCRUM""
- S in position 1 – not allowed.

Next: ""SCUBA"" – A excluded.

Next: ""SRI"" – too short.

Next: ""SRI"" (this is the 7th time I’ve tried SRI, but I realize I’m stuck in a loop).  
Let me pick a different word that avoids the excluded letters and places S and R in new positions.

Good candidate: “CURVS” – but V is less common and U is allowed, but let’s check letters: C, U, R, V, S.  
- C, U, R, V, S – none are excluded.  
- S is in position 5 (new position).  
- R is in position 3 (new position).  

This seems valid.

Another candidate: “SURFS” – S in 1 (invalid).  
“FRISK” – F, R, I, S, K – all allowed, S in 4, R in 2.  

I’ll go with “FRISK” as it uses common letters and tests new positions for S and R.",Guess 3: FRISK -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) K(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these. 

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it can’t be in position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

We now know:
- The word contains S somewhere other than the first letter.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, or E.

To maximize information on the next guess, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Places S in a new position (2-5).
2. Uses other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.

Good candidates:
- CRISP (but P isn’t super common)
- ROSES (but E is ruled out)
- SPURN (but U is less common)
- SHORN (but N is less common)

A strong choice is “SHORN”:
- S is now in position 2.
- Uses H, O, R, N – all common letters not yet ruled out.
- Contains O (a vowel) and R, N (common consonants).

This should tell us where S fits and give info on H, O, R, N.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SHORN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SHORN → S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1 (confirmed).
   - H, O, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.

Letters known to be in the word: S, R  
Letters known NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, O, N

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and R.
- Does NOT contain any of the excluded letters.
- Places S somewhere other than position 1.
- Places R somewhere other than position 4.

Possible placements:
- S could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- R could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Let’s brainstorm words fitting these constraints:
- SCUBA – contains A (excluded)
- SCARF – contains A (excluded)
- SCRUB – contains U (allowed), but B is less common
- SPROU – contains O (excluded)
- SPRIG – contains I and G, but P is allowed
- SUGAR – contains U and A (A excluded)
- SWIRL – contains W, I, R, L (L excluded)
- SQUID – contains U, Q, I, D
- SCRUM – contains C, U, M
- SCRIP – contains C, I, P
- SPRY – too short
- SRI – too short
- SCURF – contains F

A good candidate is ""SCRUB"":
- Contains S and R.
- Uses C, U, B (all allowed).
- S is in position 1 – wait, that’s not allowed (S can’t be in position 1).

Next candidate: ""SCRIP""
- Contains S, C, R, I, P.
- S is in position 1 – again not allowed.

Next: ""SPRIG""
- S in position 1 – again not allowed.

Next: ""SQUID""
- S in position 1 – again not allowed.

Next: ""SUGAR"" – A excluded.

Next: ""SWIRL"" – L excluded.

Next: ""SCRUM""
- S in position 1 – not allowed.

Next: ""SRI"" (this is the 7th time I’ve tried SRI, but I realize I’m stuck in a loop).  
Let me pick a different word that avoids the excluded letters and places S and R in new positions.

Good candidate: “CURVS” – but V is less common and U is allowed, but let’s check letters: C, U, R, V, S.  
- C, U, R, V, S – none are excluded.  
- S is in position 5 (new position).  
- R is in position 3 (new position).  

This seems valid.

Another candidate: “SURFS” – S in 1 (invalid).  
“FRISK” – F, R, I, S, K – all allowed, S in 4, R in 2.  

I’ll go with “FRISK” as it uses common letters and tests new positions for S and R.

I realize I’m stuck in a loop).  \nLet me pick a different word that avoids the excluded letters and places S and R in new positions.\n\nGood candidate: “CURVS” – but V is less common and U is allowed, but let’s check letters: C, U, R, V, S.  \n- C, U, R, V, S – none are excluded.  \n- S is in position 5 (new position).  \n- R is in position 3 (new position).  \n\nThis seems valid.\n\nAnother candidate: “SURFS” – S in 1 (invalid).  \n“FRISK” – F, R, I, S, K – all allowed, S in 4, R in 2.  \n\nI’ll go with “FRISK” as it uses common letters and tests new positions for S and R.\n\n<guess>FRISK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SHORN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)\nGuess 3: FRISK -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) K(x)\n'}]","<think>
From the three guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SHORN → S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
   - S is still not in position 1 (confirmed).
   - H, O, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.

3. FRISK → F(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) K(x)
   - F, I, K are not in the word.
   - R is still not in position 2 (so R must be in positions 3 or 5).
   - S is still not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (so S must be in position 2 or 5).

Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, O, N, F, I, K.

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and R.
- S is in position 2 or 5.
- R is in position 3 or 5 (and not in positions 2 or 4).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible combinations:
- If S is in position 2, R must be in position 3 or 5.  
  Example: _ S _ R _ or _ S _ _ R
- If S is in position 5, R must be in position 3.  
  Example: _ _ R _ S

Let’s brainstorm valid words:
- C S R _ _ → no common word.
- P S R _ _ → no.
- D S R _ _ → no.
- _ S R _ _ → ""USERS"" – but E is eliminated.
- _ S _ R _ → ""PUSHER"" – too long.
- _ _ R _ S → ""CURDS"" – C, U, R, D, S.  
  - C, U, R, D, S – none are eliminated.  
  - R is in position 3 (allowed).  
  - S is in position 5 (allowed).  
  - This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""GUSHS"" – but H is eliminated.
""GURUS"" – U, G, U, R, S – valid, but double U.
""CURDS"" seems the cleanest.

Let’s go with CURDS.

<guess>CURDS</guess>",CURDS,"From the three guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SHORN → S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
   - S is still not in position 1 (confirmed).
   - H, O, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.

3. FRISK → F(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) K(x)
   - F, I, K are not in the word.
   - R is still not in position 2 (so R must be in positions 3 or 5).
   - S is still not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (so S must be in position 2 or 5).

Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, O, N, F, I, K.

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and R.
- S is in position 2 or 5.
- R is in position 3 or 5 (and not in positions 2 or 4).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible combinations:
- If S is in position 2, R must be in position 3 or 5.  
  Example: _ S _ R _ or _ S _ _ R
- If S is in position 5, R must be in position 3.  
  Example: _ _ R _ S

Let’s brainstorm valid words:
- C S R _ _ → no common word.
- P S R _ _ → no.
- D S R _ _ → no.
- _ S R _ _ → ""USERS"" – but E is eliminated.
- _ S _ R _ → ""PUSHER"" – too long.
- _ _ R _ S → ""CURDS"" – C, U, R, D, S.  
  - C, U, R, D, S – none are eliminated.  
  - R is in position 3 (allowed).  
  - S is in position 5 (allowed).  
  - This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""GUSHS"" – but H is eliminated.
""GURUS"" – U, G, U, R, S – valid, but double U.
""CURDS"" seems the cleanest.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these. 

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it can’t be in position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

We now know:
- The word contains S somewhere other than the first letter.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, or E.

To maximize information on the next guess, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Places S in a new position (2-5).
2. Uses other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.

Good candidates:
- CRISP (but P isn’t super common)
- ROSES (but E is ruled out)
- SPURN (but U is less common)
- SHORN (but N is less common)

A strong choice is “SHORN”:
- S is now in position 2.
- Uses H, O, R, N – all common letters not yet ruled out.
- Contains O (a vowel) and R, N (common consonants).

This should tell us where S fits and give info on H, O, R, N.

Guess 2: SHORN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SHORN → S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1 (confirmed).
   - H, O, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.

Letters known to be in the word: S, R  
Letters known NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, O, N

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and R.
- Does NOT contain any of the excluded letters.
- Places S somewhere other than position 1.
- Places R somewhere other than position 4.

Possible placements:
- S could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- R could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Let’s brainstorm words fitting these constraints:
- SCUBA – contains A (excluded)
- SCARF – contains A (excluded)
- SCRUB – contains U (allowed), but B is less common
- SPROU – contains O (excluded)
- SPRIG – contains I and G, but P is allowed
- SUGAR – contains U and A (A excluded)
- SWIRL – contains W, I, R, L (L excluded)
- SQUID – contains U, Q, I, D
- SCRUM – contains C, U, M
- SCRIP – contains C, I, P
- SPRY – too short
- SRI – too short
- SCURF – contains F

A good candidate is ""SCRUB"":
- Contains S and R.
- Uses C, U, B (all allowed).
- S is in position 1 – wait, that’s not allowed (S can’t be in position 1).

Next candidate: ""SCRIP""
- Contains S, C, R, I, P.
- S is in position 1 – again not allowed.

Next: ""SPRIG""
- S in position 1 – again not allowed.

Next: ""SQUID""
- S in position 1 – again not allowed.

Next: ""SUGAR"" – A excluded.

Next: ""SWIRL"" – L excluded.

Next: ""SRI"" (this is the 7th time I’ve tried SRI, but I realize I’m stuck in a loop).  
Let me pick a different word that avoids the excluded letters and places S and R in new positions.

Good candidate: “CURVS” – but V is less common and U is allowed, but let’s check letters: C, U, R, V, S.  
- C, U, R, V, S – none are excluded.  
- S is in position 5 (new position).  
- R is in position 3 (new position).  

This seems valid.

Another candidate: “SURFS” – S in 1 (invalid).  
“FRISK” – F, R, I, S, K – all allowed, S in 4, R in 2.  

I’ll go with “FRISK” as it uses common letters and tests new positions for S and R.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SHORN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
Guess 3: FRISK -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SHORN → S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
   - S is still not in position 1 (confirmed).
   - H, O, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.

3. FRISK → F(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) K(x)
   - F, I, K are not in the word.
   - R is still not in position 2 (so R must be in positions 3 or 5).
   - S is still not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (so S must be in position 2 or 5).

Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, O, N, F, I, K.

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and R.
- S is in position 2 or 5.
- R is in position 3 or 5 (and not in positions 2 or 4).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible combinations:
- If S is in position 2, R must be in position 3 or 5.  
  Example: _ S _ R _ or _ S _ _ R
- If S is in position 5, R must be in position 3.  
  Example: _ _ R _ S

Let’s brainstorm valid words:
- C S R _ _ → no common word.
- P S R _ _ → no.
- D S R _ _ → no.
- _ S R _ _ → ""USERS"" – but E is eliminated.
- _ S _ R _ → ""PUSHER"" – too long.
- _ _ R _ S → ""CURDS"" – C, U, R, D, S.  
  - C, U, R, D, S – none are eliminated.  
  - R is in position 3 (allowed).  
  - S is in position 5 (allowed).  
  - This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""GUSHS"" – but H is eliminated.
""GURUS"" – U, G, U, R, S – valid, but double U.
""CURDS"" seems the cleanest.

Let’s go with CURDS.

Possible letters for position 4: B, G, M, P, V, W, Y (and possibly S, but S is already used).

Looking for valid words:
- B U R ? S → ""BURBS"" – but B is repeated and we don't know if B is allowed. Also, B is allowed.
- G U R ? S → ""GURUS"" – but U is already used in position 2 and we don't know if double U is allowed. Also, S is already in position 5.

""WURMS"" fits the pattern _ U R _ S and uses only allowed letters.

Let's check:
- W – allowed (not eliminated)
- U – already confirmed correct in position 2

This seems to be the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these. 

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it can’t be in position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

We now know:
- The word contains S somewhere other than the first letter.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, or E.

To maximize information on the next guess, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Places S in a new position (2-5).
2. Uses other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.

Good candidates:
- CRISP (but P isn’t super common)
- ROSES (but E is ruled out)
- SPURN (but U is less common)
- SHORN (but N is less common)

A strong choice is “SHORN”:
- S is now in position 2.
- Uses H, O, R, N – all common letters not yet ruled out.
- Contains O (a vowel) and R, N (common consonants).

This should tell us where S fits and give info on H, O, R, N.

Guess 2: SHORN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SHORN → S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1 (confirmed).
   - H, O, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.

Letters known to be in the word: S, R  
Letters known NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, O, N

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and R.
- Does NOT contain any of the excluded letters.
- Places S somewhere other than position 1.
- Places R somewhere other than position 4.

Possible placements:
- S could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- R could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Let’s brainstorm words fitting these constraints:
- SCUBA – contains A (excluded)
- SCARF – contains A (excluded)
- SCRUB – contains U (allowed), but B is less common
- SPROU – contains O (excluded)
- SPRIG – contains I and G, but P is allowed
- SUGAR – contains U and A (A excluded)
- SWIRL – contains W, I, R, L (L excluded)
- SQUID – contains U, Q, I, D
- SCRUM – contains C, U, M
- SCRIP – contains C, I, P
- SPRY – too short
- SRI – too short
- SCURF – contains F

A good candidate is ""SCRUB"":
- Contains S and R.
- Uses C, U, B (all allowed).
- S is in position 1 – wait, that’s not allowed (S can’t be in position 1).

Next candidate: ""SCRIP""
- Contains S, C, R, I, P.
- S is in position 1 – again not allowed.

Next: ""SPRIG""
- S in position 1 – again not allowed.

Next: ""SRI"" (this is the 7th time I’ve tried SRI, but I realize I’m stuck in a loop).  
Let me pick a different word that avoids the excluded letters and places S and R in new positions.

Good candidate: “CURVS” – but V is less common and U is allowed, but let’s check letters: C, U, R, V, S.  
- C, U, R, V, S – none are excluded.  
- S is in position 5 (new position).  
- R is in position 3 (new position).  

This seems valid.

Another candidate: “SURFS” – S in 1 (invalid).  
“FRISK” – F, R, I, S, K – all allowed, S in 4, R in 2.  

I’ll go with “FRISK” as it uses common letters and tests new positions for S and R.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SHORN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
Guess 3: FRISK -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SHORN → S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
   - S is still not in position 1 (confirmed).
   - H, O, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.

3. FRISK → F(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) K(x)
   - F, I, K are not in the word.
   - R is still not in position 2 (so R must be in positions 3 or 5).
   - S is still not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (so S must be in position 2 or 5).

Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, O, N, F, I, K.

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and R.
- S is in position 2 or 5.
- R is in position 3 or 5 (and not in positions 2 or 4).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible combinations:
- If S is in position 2, R must be in position 3 or 5.  
  Example: _ S _ R _ or _ S _ _ R
- If S is in position 5, R must be in position 3.  
  Example: _ _ R _ S

Let’s brainstorm valid words:
- C S R _ _ → no common word.
- P S R _ _ → no.
- D S R _ _ → no.
- _ S R _ _ → ""USERS"" – but E is eliminated.
- _ S _ R _ → ""PUSHER"" – too long.
- _ _ R _ S → ""CURDS"" – C, U, R, D, S.  
  - C, U, R, D, S – none are eliminated.  
  - R is in position 3 (allowed).  
  - S is in position 5 (allowed).  
  - This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""GUSHS"" – but H is eliminated.
""GURUS"" – U, G, U, R, S – valid, but double U.
""CURDS"" seems the cleanest.

Let’s go with CURDS.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SHORN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
Guess 3: FRISK -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) K(x)
Guess 4: CURDS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) U(✓) R(✓) D(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback (Guess 4: CURDS):

- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- U(✓) → U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- D(x) → D is not in the word.
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know the exact pattern: _ U R _ S

Letters already eliminated: L, A, T, E, H, O, N, F, I, K, C, D.

Remaining common letters: B, G, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern ? U R ? S, using only allowed letters.

Possible letters for position 1: B, G, M, P, V, W, Y (and possibly S, but S is already in position 5).

Possible letters for position 4: B, G, M, P, V, W, Y (and possibly S, but S is already used).

Looking for valid words:
- B U R ? S → ""BURBS"" – but B is repeated and we don't know if B is allowed. Also, B is allowed.
- G U R ? S → ""GURUS"" – but U is already used in position 2 and we don't know if double U is allowed. Also, S is already in position 5.
- M U R ? S → ""MURDS"" – D is eliminated.
- P U R ? S → ""PURPS"" – P is allowed, but PURPS might not be a valid word.
- V U R ? S → ""VURGS"" – not a valid word.
- W U R ? S → ""WURMS"" – W, U, R, M, S – all allowed and forms a valid word.

""WURMS"" fits the pattern _ U R _ S and uses only allowed letters.

Let's check:
- W – allowed (not eliminated)
- U – already confirmed correct in position 2
- R – already confirmed correct in position 3
- M – allowed (not eliminated)
- S – already confirmed correct in position 5

This seems to be the best next guess.

Uses other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.\n\nGood candidates:\n- CRISP (but P isn’t super common)\n- ROSES (but E is ruled out)\n- SPURN (but U is less common)\n- SHORN (but N is less common)\n\nA strong choice is “SHORN”:\n- S is now in position 2.\n- Uses H, O, R, N – all common letters not yet ruled out.\n- Contains O (a vowel) and R, N (common consonants).\n\nThis should tell us where S fits and give info on H, O, R, N.\n\n<guess>SHORN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SHORN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two guesses so far:\n\n1.

and R.\n- Does NOT contain any of the excluded letters.\n- Places S somewhere other than position 1.\n- Places R somewhere other than position 4.\n\nPossible placements:\n- S could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n- R could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).\n\nLet’s brainstorm words fitting these constraints:\n- SCUBA – contains A (excluded)\n- SCARF – contains A (excluded)\n- SCRUB – contains U (allowed), but B is less common\n- SPROU – contains O (excluded)\n- SPRIG – contains I and G, but P is allowed\n- SUGAR – contains U and A (A excluded)\n- SWIRL – contains W, I, R, L (L excluded)\n- SQUID – contains U, Q, I, D\n- SCRUM – contains C, U, M\n- SCRIP – contains C, I, P\n- SPRY – too short\n- SRI – too short\n- SCURF – contains F\n\nA good candidate is ""SCRUB"":\n- Contains S and R.\n- Uses C, U, B (all allowed).\n- S is in position 1 – wait, that’s not allowed (S can’t be in position 1).\n\nNext candidate: ""SCRIP""\n- Contains S, C, R, I, P.\n- S is in position 1 – again not allowed.\n\nNext: ""SPRIG""\n- S in position 1 – again not allowed.\n\nNext: ""SQUID""\n- S in position 1 – again not allowed.\n\nNext: ""SUGAR"" – A excluded.\n\nNext:
