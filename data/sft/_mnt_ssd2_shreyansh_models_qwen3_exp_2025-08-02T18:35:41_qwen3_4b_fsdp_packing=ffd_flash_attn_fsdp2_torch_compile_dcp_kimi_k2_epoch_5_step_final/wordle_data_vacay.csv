For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that can help eliminate or confirm many letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels: A, O, E
- 2 common consonants: R, S
This combination should give good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere other than the first letter.
2. Doesn’t use R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, B, G, H.

A strong second guess would be ""TULIP"":
- Uses T, U, L, I, P (all still possible).
- Places A somewhere else (but since we don’t know where A is, this avoids the first position and gives coverage elsewhere).

However, since we know A is somewhere, a better guess would be ""PLANT"":
- Uses P, L, A, N, T.
- A is in position 3 (not first), and introduces P, L, N, T which are common.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)

   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. plant → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P, L, N, T are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (it was in position 3 in plant and still marked as “-”, so A must be in position 2, 4, or 5).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: A (positions 2, 4, or 5)

We need a 5-letter word that:

- Does not contain R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

A good next guess should use these letters and place A in one of the allowed positions. Let’s try a word with A in position 2: “BACON” is out (O is excluded). “CABIN” is out (I and N are allowed, but N is excluded). “GAMMA” has two Ms and no exclusions except A is in position 2. But G, M, M are allowed. However, “GAMMA” repeats M and has two Ms, which might be less informative.

Another option is “HABIT” – but T is excluded. “VAMPI” – P is excluded. “CABBY” – Y is allowed, B is allowed, but we need to check exclusions. Actually, let’s list possible positions for A:

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.

Let’s try A in position 4: “BUDGE” – E is excluded. “CUBIC” – C, U, B, I, C. C, U, B, I are allowed. This seems good.

“CUBIC”:
- C, U, B, I, C
- A is not used here, but we know A must be in the word, so this might not be optimal. We need to include A.

Let’s try A in position 5: “BUDGY” – Y is allowed, B, U, D, G are allowed. This seems good.

“BUDGY”:
- B, U, D, G, Y
- A is not in this word, but we know A must be in the word, so this is invalid.

We must include A. Let’s try A in position 2: “BAMBO” – O is excluded. “CABIN” – N is excluded. “DABBA” – B, D, A, B, A. B and D are allowed, but we have two Bs and two As, which might be less informative.

A better option is “MADAM” – M, A, D, A, M. M and D are allowed, but again repeats letters.

Let’s try A in position 4: “BUDGE” – E excluded. “CUBIC” – no A. “GUMMY” – no A.

We need a word with A in position 2, 4, or 5, using allowed letters.

A good candidate is “BAGGY” – but G, Y are allowed, B is allowed, but A is in position 2. This uses B, A, G, G, Y.

However, we can do better: “CABIN” is invalid (N excluded). “DABBA” is okay (B, D, A, B, A) but repeats.

Let’s try “BAMBO” – O excluded. “CABAL” – L excluded. “DAMNS” – S excluded. “GAMAS” – S excluded.

A valid word with A in position 2: “BAMBO” is invalid (O). “CABIN” invalid (N). “DAMNS” invalid (S). 

Let’s try A in position 5: “BUDGY” invalid (no A). “CUBIC” invalid (no A). 

A valid word with A in position 4: “BUDGE” invalid (E). 

A valid word with A in position 2: “CABIN” invalid (N). 

Let’s try “BAGGY” – B, A, G, G, Y. This uses B, A, G, Y. G and Y are allowed, B is allowed. 

This seems like the best option: “BAGGY”.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that can help eliminate or confirm many letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels: A, O, E
- 2 common consonants: R, S
This combination should give good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere other than the first letter.
2. Doesn’t use R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, B, G, H.

A strong second guess would be ""TULIP"":
- Uses T, U, L, I, P (all still possible).
- Places A somewhere else (but since we don’t know where A is, this avoids the first position and gives coverage elsewhere).

However, since we know A is somewhere, a better guess would be ""PLANT"":
- Uses P, L, A, N, T.
- A is in position 3 (not first), and introduces P, L, N, T which are common.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. plant → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P, L, N, T are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (it was in position 3 in plant and still marked as “-”, so A must be in position 2, 4, or 5).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: A (positions 2, 4, or 5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Does not contain R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

A good next guess should use these letters and place A in one of the allowed positions. Let’s try a word with A in position 2: “BACON” is out (O is excluded). “CABIN” is out (I and N are allowed, but N is excluded). “GAMMA” has two Ms and no exclusions except A is in position 2. But G, M, M are allowed. However, “GAMMA” repeats M and has two Ms, which might be less informative.

Another option is “HABIT” – but T is excluded. “VAMPI” – P is excluded. “CABBY” – Y is allowed, B is allowed, but we need to check exclusions. Actually, let’s list possible positions for A:

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.

Let’s try A in position 4: “BUDGE” – E is excluded. “CUBIC” – C, U, B, I, C. C, U, B, I are allowed. This seems good.

“CUBIC”:
- C, U, B, I, C
- A is not used here, but we know A must be in the word, so this might not be optimal. We need to include A.

Let’s try A in position 5: “BUDGY” – Y is allowed, B, U, D, G are allowed. This seems good.

“BUDGY”:
- B, U, D, G, Y
- A is not in this word, but we know A must be in the word, so this is invalid.

We must include A. Let’s try A in position 2: “BAMBO” – O is excluded. “CABIN” – N is excluded. “DABBA” – B, D, A, B, A. B and D are allowed, but we have two Bs and two As, which might be less informative.

A better option is “MADAM” – M, A, D, A, M. M and D are allowed, but again repeats letters.

Let’s try A in position 4: “BUDGE” – E excluded. “CUBIC” – no A. “GUMMY” – no A.

We need a word with A in position 2, 4, or 5, using allowed letters.

A good candidate is “BAGGY” – but G, Y are allowed, B is allowed, but A is in position 2. This uses B, A, G, G, Y.

However, we can do better: “CABIN” is invalid (N excluded). “DABBA” is okay (B, D, A, B, A) but repeats.

Let’s try “BAMBO” – O excluded. “CABAL” – L excluded. “DAMNS” – S excluded. “GAMAS” – S excluded.

A valid word with A in position 2: “BAMBO” is invalid (O). “CABIN” invalid (N). “DAMNS” invalid (S). 

Let’s try A in position 5: “BUDGY” invalid (no A). “CUBIC” invalid (no A). 

A valid word with A in position 4: “BUDGE” invalid (E). 

A valid word with A in position 2: “CABIN” invalid (N). 

Let’s try “BAGGY” – B, A, G, G, Y. This uses B, A, G, Y. G and Y are allowed, B is allowed. 

This seems like the best option: “BAGGY”.

But let’s check if there’s a better word. Another option is “MADAM” – M, A, D, A, M. This uses M, A, D. 

“MADAM” seems better as it uses M, A, D. 

Let’s go with “MADAM”.

From the new feedback on MADAM:

- D(x): D is NOT in the word.
- A(✓) at position 4: A is in the word and is in position 4.
- M(x): M is NOT in the word.

This is a contradiction: the same letter A cannot simultaneously be in position 2 and position 4. The feedback symbols are applied per-position, so:

- Position 1: M(x) → M not in word.
- Position 2: A(✓) → A is in the word and is in position 2.
- Position 3: D(x) → D not in word.
- Position 4: A(✓) → A is in the word and is in position 4.
- Position 5: M(x) → M not in word.

The only way this can happen is if the word has two A's, one in position 2 and one in position 4. So the word must be of the form: _ A _ A _

From earlier feedback:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, M, D
- Allowed letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ A _ A _ using only the allowed letters. Possible candidates:
- BAGGY (but Y is allowed, G is allowed) – but this has A in position 2 and 4, and G in 3 and 5. But G is allowed.
- CAVAS – but S is excluded.
- FABIA – but I is allowed, B is allowed, but A is in position 2 and 4, F is allowed.
- GABBA – B is allowed, G is allowed.
- HABIA – H is allowed, B is allowed, I is allowed.
- KABAK – K is allowed, B is allowed.

The most common word fitting this pattern is ""GABBA"" (though it's a proper noun, it's valid in Wordle). Another is ""BAGGY"".

""BAGGY"" uses B, A, G, G, Y. All letters are allowed except we already know G and Y are allowed. This seems like the best guess.

But let's check ""BAGGY"":
- B: allowed
- A: in position 2 and 4 (matches feedback)
- G: allowed
- G: allowed
- Y: allowed

This fits perfectly. So the next guess is BAGGY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that can help eliminate or confirm many letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels: A, O, E
- 2 common consonants: R, S
This combination should give good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

- BAGGY (but Y is allowed, G is allowed) – but this has A in position 2 and 4, and G in 3 and 5. But G is allowed.
- CAVAS – but S is excluded.
- FABIA – but I is allowed, B is allowed, but A is in position 2 and 4, F is allowed.
- GABBA – B is allowed, G is allowed.
- HABIA – H is allowed, B is allowed, I is allowed.
- KABAK – K is allowed, B is allowed.

The most common word fitting this pattern is ""GABBA"" (though it's a proper noun, it's valid in Wordle). Another is ""BAGGY"".

""BAGGY"" uses B, A, G, G, Y. All letters are allowed except we already know G and Y are allowed. This seems like the best guess.

But let's check ""BAGGY"":
- B: allowed
- A: in position 2 and 4 (matches feedback)
- G: allowed
- G: allowed
- Y: allowed

This fits perfectly. So the next guess is BAGGY.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that can help eliminate or confirm many letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels: A, O, E
- 2 common consonants: R, S
This combination should give good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x): R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere other than the first letter.
2. Doesn’t use R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, B, G, H.

A strong second guess would be ""TULIP"":
- Uses T, U, L, I, P (all still possible).
- Places A somewhere else (but since we don’t know where A is, this avoids the first position and gives coverage elsewhere).

However, since we know A is somewhere, a better guess would be ""PLANT"":
- Uses P, L, A, N, T.
- A is in position 3 (not first), and introduces P, L, N, T which are common.

Let’s go with ""PLANT"".

<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. plant → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P, L, N, T are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (it was in position 3 in plant and still marked as “-”, so A must be in position 2, 4, or 5).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: A (positions 2, 4, or 5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Does not contain R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

A good next guess should use these letters and place A in one of the allowed positions. Let’s try a word with A in position 2: “BACON” is out (O is excluded). “CABIN” is out (I and N are allowed, but N is excluded). “GAMMA” has two Ms and no exclusions except A is in position 2. But G, M, M are allowed. However, “GAMMA” repeats M and has two Ms, which might be less informative.

Another option is “HABIT” – but T is excluded. “VAMPI” – P is excluded. “CABBY” – Y is allowed, B is allowed, but we need to check exclusions. Actually, let’s list possible positions for A:

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5.

Let’s try A in position 4: “BUDGE” – E is excluded. “CUBIC” – C, U, B, I, C. C, U, B, I are allowed. This seems good.

“CUBIC”:
- C, U, B, I, C
- A is not used here, but we know A must be in the word, so this might not be optimal. We need to include A.

Let’s try A in position 5: “BUDGY” – Y is allowed, B, U, D, G are allowed. This seems good.

“BUDGY”:
- B, U, D, G, Y
- A is not in this word, but we know A must be in the word, so this is invalid.

We must include A. Let’s try A in position 2: “BAMBO” – O is excluded. “CABIN” – N is excluded. “DABBA” – B, D, A, B, A. B and D are allowed, but we have two Bs and two As, which might be less informative.

A better option is “MADAM” – M, A, D, A, M. M and D are allowed, but again repeats letters.

Let’s try A in position 4: “BUDGE” – E excluded. “CUBIC” – no A. “GUMMY” – no A.

We need a word with A in position 2, 4, or 5, using allowed letters.

A good candidate is “BAGGY” – but G, Y are allowed, B is allowed, but A is in position 2. This uses B, A, G, G, Y.

However, we can do better: “CABIN” is invalid (N excluded). “DABBA” is okay (B, D, A, B, A) but repeats.

Let’s try “BAMBO” – O excluded. “CABAL” – L excluded. “DAMNS” – S excluded. “GAMAS” – S excluded.

A valid word with A in position 2: “BAMBO” is invalid (O). “CABIN” invalid (N). “DAMNS” invalid (S). 

Let’s try A in position 5: “BUDGY” invalid (no A). “CUBIC” invalid (no A). 

A valid word with A in position 4: “BUDGE” invalid (E). 

A valid word with A in position 2: “CABIN” invalid (N). 

Let’s try “BAGGY” – B, A, G, G, Y. This uses B, A, G, Y. G and Y are allowed, B is allowed. 

This seems like the best option: “BAGGY”.

But let’s check if there’s a better word. Another option is “MADAM” – M, A, D, A, M. This uses M, A, D. 

“MADAM” seems better as it uses M, A, D. 

Let’s go with “MADAM”.

Guess 3: madam -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) D(x) A(✓) M(x)

From the new feedback on MADAM:

- M(x): M is NOT in the word.
- A(✓) at position 2: A is in the word and is in position 2.
- D(x): D is NOT in the word.
- A(✓) at position 4: A is in the word and is in position 4.
- M(x): M is NOT in the word.

This is a contradiction: the same letter A cannot simultaneously be in position 2 and position 4. The feedback symbols are applied per-position, so:

- Position 1: M(x) → M not in word.
- Position 2: A(✓) → A is in the word and is in position 2.
- Position 3: D(x) → D not in word.
- Position 4: A(✓) → A is in the word and is in position 4.
- Position 5: M(x) → M not in word.

The only way this can happen is if the word has two A's, one in position 2 and one in position 4. So the word must be of the form: _ A _ A _

From earlier feedback:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, M, D
- Allowed letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ A _ A _ using only the allowed letters. Possible candidates:
- BAGGY (but Y is allowed, G is allowed) – but this has A in position 2 and 4, and G in 3 and 5. But G is allowed.
- CAVAS – but S is excluded.
- FABIA – but I is allowed, B is allowed, but A is in position 2 and 4, F is allowed.
- GABBA – B is allowed, G is allowed.
- HABIA – H is allowed, B is allowed, I is allowed.
- KABAK – K is allowed, B is allowed.

The most common word fitting this pattern is ""GABBA"" (though it's a proper noun, it's valid in Wordle). Another is ""BAGGY"".

""BAGGY"" uses B, A, G, G, Y. All letters are allowed except we already know G and Y are allowed. This seems like the best guess.

But let's check ""BAGGY"":
- B: allowed
- A: in position 2 and 4 (matches feedback)
- G: allowed
- G: allowed
- Y: allowed

This fits perfectly. So the next guess is BAGGY.

So the next guess is “HACKY”.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

Current confirmed facts:
- Pattern: _ A C _ Y  (positions 2=A, 3=C, 5=Y)
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, M, D, B, G, H, K
- Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4: from the unused alphabet excluding the above. Remaining common letters include F, I, U, V, W.

So the word is of the form: ? A C ? Y
We need a 5-letter word that matches this pattern using only the allowed letters.

Possible first letters: F, I, U, V, W
Possible fourth letters: F, I, U, V, W (since K, G, H, etc. are out)
