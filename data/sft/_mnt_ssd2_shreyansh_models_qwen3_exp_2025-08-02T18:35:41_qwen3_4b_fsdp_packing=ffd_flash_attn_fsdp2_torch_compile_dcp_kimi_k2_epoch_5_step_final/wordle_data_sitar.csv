### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants that frequently appear in English words. Another strong candidate could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and S which are particularly common. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to gather maximum information about the secret word.

Let’s consolidate the information so far:

Letters that are in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):
- A (cannot be in positions 1 or 2)
- R (cannot be in positions 2 or 1)
- S (cannot be in positions 4 or 5)
- I (cannot be in position 3)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, E, N

So the secret word must contain A, R, S, I and one more letter that is not yet eliminated (i.e., not O, E, N).

We also know the forbidden positions:
- A: not 1st or 2nd → possible positions 3,4,5
- R: not 1st or 2nd → possible positions 3,4,5
- S: not 4th or 5th → possible positions 1,2,3
- I: not 3rd → possible positions 1,2,4,5

We need a valid 5-letter word that uses A, R, S, I plus one new letter (not O, E, N). Let’s try to place the letters in allowed positions.

Candidate words:
- SARI_ – but we need a 5th letter. SARI plus a letter that fits constraints.
- _SARI – but S must be in 1,2,3. Let’s try SARI_.
- RAS_ I – but R and A have position restrictions.
- Let’s try “SARIN” – but N is already ruled out.
- “RAIS_” – but S is 5th, which is forbidden for S.
- “SIR_A” – but A is 4th, which is allowed.

A valid word that fits: SIR_A. Let’s pick “SIRCA” – but C is allowed. However, “SIRCA” is not a valid English word.

Another approach: since we have A, R, S, I, we need a 5th letter. Let’s try T, L, D, C, U, etc.

Try “RASTI” – but S is 3rd, which is allowed. However, “RASTI” is not a valid word.

Try “RASTI” → invalid.

Try “STAIR” – but we have 5 letters, and “STAIR” is 5 letters. Let’s check:
- S: 1st (allowed)
- T: new letter
- A: 3rd (allowed)
- I: 4th (allowed)
- R: 5th (allowed)

This uses A, R, S, I plus T (not O, E, N). “STAIR” is a valid English word.

Let’s verify positions:
- S: not 4th or 5th → 1st is fine
- A: not 1st or 2nd → 3rd is fine
- R: not 1st or 2nd → 5th is fine
- I: not 3rd → 4th is fine
- T: new letter, allowed

Therefore, “STAIR” is a valid next guess.

Let’s consolidate the information so far:

Letters that are in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):
- A (cannot be in positions 1 or 2)
- R (cannot be in positions 2 or 1)
- S (cannot be in positions 4 or 5)
- I (cannot be in position 3)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, E, N

So the secret word must contain A, R, S, I and one more letter that is not yet eliminated (i.e., not O, E, N).

We also know the forbidden positions:
- A: not 1st or 2nd → possible positions 3,4,5
- R: not 1st or 2nd → possible positions 3,4,5
- S: not 4th or 5th → possible positions 1,2,3
- I: not 3rd → possible positions 1,2,4,5

We need a valid 5-letter word that uses A, R, S, I plus one new letter (not O, E, N). Let’s try to place the letters in allowed positions.

Candidate words:
- SARI_ – but we need a 5th letter. SARI plus a letter that fits constraints.
- _SARI – but S must be in 1,2,3. Let’s try SARI_.
- RAS_ I – but R and A have position restrictions.
- Let’s try “SARIN” – but N is already ruled out.
- “RAIS_” – but S is 5th, which is forbidden for S.
- “SIR_A” – but A is 4th, which is allowed.

A valid word that fits: SIR_A. Let’s pick “SIRCA” – but C is allowed. However, “SIRCA” is not a valid English word.

Another approach: since we have A, R, S, I, we need a 5th letter. Let’s try T, L, D, C, U, etc.

Try “RASTI” – but S is 3rd, which is allowed. However, “RASTI” is not a valid word.

Try “RASTI” → invalid.

Try “STAIR” – but we have 5 letters, and “STAIR” is 5 letters. Let’s check:
- S: 1st (allowed)
- T: new letter
- A: 3rd (allowed)
- I: 4th (allowed)
- R: 5th (allowed)

This uses A, R, S, I plus T (not O, E, N). “STAIR” is a valid English word.

Let’s verify positions:
- S: not 4th or 5th → 1st is fine
- A: not 1st or 2nd → 3rd is fine
- R: not 1st or 2nd → 5th is fine
- I: not 3rd → 4th is fine
- T: new letter, allowed

Therefore, “STAIR” is a valid next guess.

From Guess 3 (STAIR → S✓ T– A– I– R✓) we now know:

- S is correct in position 1.
- R is correct in position 5.
- T is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- I is in the word but not in position 4.

So the word looks like: S _ _ _ R

Letters we have confirmed:
- S (position 1)
- R (position 5)
- T (somewhere except position 2)
- A (somewhere except positions 1, 2, 3)
- I (somewhere except positions 3, 4)

Also, letters we have ruled out: O, E, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Ends with R
- Contains T, A, I in the remaining three positions
- Does not use O, E, N

Possible positions for the remaining letters (positions 2, 3, 4):
- T cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 3 or 4.
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, so it must be in position 4.
- I cannot be in positions 3, 4, so it must be in position 2.

This gives us:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: R

So the word must be S I T A R.

Checking:
- S I T A R is a valid English word (meaning “to look at closely”).
- It starts with S and ends with R.
- It contains T, A, I in positions 3, 4, 2 respectively, satisfying all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is SITAR.
