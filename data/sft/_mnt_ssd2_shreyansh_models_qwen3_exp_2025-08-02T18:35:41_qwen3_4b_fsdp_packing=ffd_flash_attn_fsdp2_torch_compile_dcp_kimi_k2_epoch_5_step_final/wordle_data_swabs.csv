### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- Has A in the 3rd position

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- A is correct in position 3 (✓)
- L, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Word has A in position 3
3. Letters not used: L, T, E

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has A in the 3rd position
- Does NOT contain L, T, E

Some possibilities:
- S _ A _ _
- Common letters left to try: R, N, I, C, H, O, U, D, M, P, Y, etc.

Good candidates:
- SCARF (but has F at end, not sure)
- SHARK (but has H and R)
- SPANK (but has P and N)
- SNACK (but has N and C)
- SWARM (but has W and R, M)

Let me pick ""SHARK"" because it uses common letters H, R, K which haven't been tested yet and fits the known constraints.

From the two guesses we have:

   - Confirms S in position 1 and A in position 3
   - Adds H, R, K as absent
   - New information: H, R, K are not in the word

So far we know:
- Pattern: S _ A _ _
- Forbidden letters: L, T, E, H, R, K
- Remaining common letters to try: N, I, C, O, U, D, M, P, Y, G, B, F, W, V

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has A in the 3rd position
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible candidates:
- SNA _ _  (but needs 5 letters)
- SCALY (but has L which is forbidden)

- SWAMP (W, A, M, P)
- SNAKY (but has K which is forbidden)
- SCARF (has R which is forbidden)

- SNAFU (but has U and F)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- A is correct in position 3 (✓)
- L, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Word has A in position 3
3. Letters not used: L, T, E

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has A in the 3rd position
- Does NOT contain L, T, E

Some possibilities:
- S _ A _ _
- Common letters left to try: R, N, I, C, H, O, U, D, M, P, Y, etc.

Good candidates:
- SCARF (but has F at end, not sure)
- SHARK (but has H and R)
- SPANK (but has P and N)
- SNACK (but has N and C)
- SWARM (but has W and R, M)

Let me pick ""SHARK"" because it uses common letters H, R, K which haven't been tested yet and fits the known constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SHARK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) A(✓) R(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   - Word starts with S
   - A is in position 3
   - Letters not present: L, T, E

2. SHARK → S(✓) H(x) A(✓) R(x) K(x)
   - Confirms S in position 1 and A in position 3
   - Adds H, R, K as absent
   - New information: H, R, K are not in the word

So far we know:
- Pattern: S _ A _ _
- Forbidden letters: L, T, E, H, R, K
- Remaining common letters to try: N, I, C, O, U, D, M, P, Y, G, B, F, W, V

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has A in the 3rd position
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible candidates:
- SNA _ _  (but needs 5 letters)
- SCALY (but has L which is forbidden)
- SPASM (but has M and S, and P)
- SWAMP (W, A, M, P)
- SNAKY (but has K which is forbidden)
- SCARF (has R which is forbidden)
- SPOOF (O, O, F)
- SNAFU (but has U and F)

""SWAMP"" seems good:
- S W A M P
- Uses W, M, P which haven't been tested
- Fits all constraints

Let me check if ""SWAMP"" is valid: yes, it's a common word.

From the three guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   - S is correct in position 1
   - A is correct in position 3
   - L, T, E are not in the word

2. SHARK → S(✓) H(x) A(✓) R(x) K(x)
   - Confirms S in position 1 and A in position 3
   - H, R, K are not in the word

3. SWAMP → S(✓) W(✓) A(✓) M(x) P(x)
   - Confirms S in position 1, W in position 2, A in position 3
   - M, P are not in the word

Current constraints:
- Pattern: S W A _ _
- Forbidden letters: L, T, E, H, R, K, M, P
- Allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, N, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with SWA
- Uses only allowed letters
- Common remaining letters to test: N, D, G, I, O, U, Y

Possible candidates:
- SWANG (but has G and N; G is allowed, N is allowed)
- SWAIN (I and N are allowed)
- SWAYY (but Y is repeated, and SWAYY isn't a common word)
- SWANG is a valid word meaning ""to bend or twist sharply""

Let's check SWANG:
- S W A N G
- N and G haven't been tested yet
- Fits all constraints

From the four guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   - S is correct in position 1
   - A is correct in position 3
   - L, T, E are not in the word

2. SHARK → S(✓) H(x) A(✓) R(x) K(x)
   - Confirms S in position 1 and A in position 3
   - H, R, K are not in the word

3. SWAMP → S(✓) W(✓) A(✓) M(x) P(x)
   - Confirms S in position 1, W in position 2, A in position 3
   - M, P are not in the word

4. SWANG → S(✓) W(✓) A(✓) N(x) G(x)
   - Confirms S in position 1, W in position 2, A in position 3
   - N, G are not in the word

Current constraints:
- Pattern: S W A _ _
- Forbidden letters: L, T, E, H, R, K, M, P, N, G
- Allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, I, J, O, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with SWA
- Uses only allowed letters
- Common remaining letters to test: B, C, D, F, I, O, U, Y

Possible candidates:
- SWABY (but Y is allowed, B is allowed)
- SWAID (but D is allowed, I is allowed)
- SWAIF (but F is allowed, I is allowed)
- SWAIC (not a valid word)
- SWAID is valid but uncommon
- SWAIF is valid (means a young person or a stream)

Let's check SWAIF:
- S W A I F
- I and F are allowed
- It's a valid word

Alternatively, SWABY is also valid but less common. Between these, SWAIF seems more likely.
