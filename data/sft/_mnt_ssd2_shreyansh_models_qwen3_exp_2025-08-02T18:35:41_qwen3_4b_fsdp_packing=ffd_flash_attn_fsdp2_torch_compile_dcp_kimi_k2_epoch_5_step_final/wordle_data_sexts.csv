### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many letters early on. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This will give me maximum information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O are not in the word at all (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- Contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

Next, I need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes S and E somewhere (but not in positions 4 and 5).
- Excludes A, R, O.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

From the new feedback on “stein”:

- S is now confirmed in position 1 (✓).  
- T is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
- E is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
- I and N are not in the word at all (x).  

So the secret word looks like:  
S _ _ _ _  
Letters known to be in the word: S, T, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, I, N  
Positions ruled out so far:  
- S cannot be in position 2 (already fixed in position 1).  
- T cannot be in position 2.  
- E cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from arose and stein).  
  – From arose: E was in position 5 and marked “-” (wrong position).  
  – From stein: E was in position 3 and marked “-” (wrong position).  
  Therefore E must be in position 4.

Current partial word: S _ _ E _

Letters left to place: T (must go in position 3 or 5).  
E is already in position 4.

Remaining common letters not yet used: C, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

Candidate words:
- S T _ E _ → “STE__” – possible “STEEP” (but P not yet ruled out), “STOLE” (but O is out), “STOLE” invalid.  
- S _ T E _ → “S_T_E_” – possible “SUTLE” (not valid), “SMOTE” (O out), “SWETE” (invalid).  
- “STOLE” invalid because O is out.  
- “STEEL” – but E is already in position 4, so position 5 can’t be E (no duplicate info yet).  
- “STEEP” – E is already in position 4, so position 5 can be E.  
  Check if “STEEP” is valid: yes, it is a word.

Let’s try “STEEP”:
- S in position 1 (✓).  
- T in position 2 (was ruled out for position 2, so this is invalid).  
Oops, T cannot be in position 2 (from stein feedback).  
Therefore “STEEP” is invalid.

Invalid.

Next: “STETE” – invalid (E in position 5 is allowed, but T in position 4 is new).  
But “STETE” is not a valid word.

Hmm, seems limited. Let’s try “STEED” – D new, E in position 4, E in position 5 allowed.  
“STEED” is valid.

“STEVE” is valid.  
T is in position 2 – invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many letters early on. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This will give me maximum information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O are not in the word at all (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- Contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

Next, I need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes S and E somewhere (but not in positions 4 and 5).
- Excludes A, R, O.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

A strong candidate is ""STEIN"":
- Contains S and E (not in positions 4/5).
- Uses T, I, N which are common and not yet ruled out.
- No A, R, or O.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on “stein”:

- S is now confirmed in position 1 (✓).  
- T is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
- E is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
- I and N are not in the word at all (x).  

So the secret word looks like:  
S _ _ _ _  
Letters known to be in the word: S, T, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, I, N  
Positions ruled out so far:  
- S cannot be in position 2 (already fixed in position 1).  
- T cannot be in position 2.  
- E cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from arose and stein).  
  – From arose: E was in position 5 and marked “-” (wrong position).  
  – From stein: E was in position 3 and marked “-” (wrong position).  
  Therefore E must be in position 4.

Current partial word: S _ _ E _

Letters left to place: T (must go in position 3 or 5).  
E is already in position 4.

Remaining common letters not yet used: C, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

Candidate words:
- S T _ E _ → “STE__” – possible “STEEP” (but P not yet ruled out), “STOLE” (but O is out), “STOLE” invalid.  
- S _ T E _ → “S_T_E_” – possible “SUTLE” (not valid), “SMOTE” (O out), “SWETE” (invalid).  
- “STOLE” invalid because O is out.  
- “STEEL” – but E is already in position 4, so position 5 can’t be E (no duplicate info yet).  
- “STEEP” – E is already in position 4, so position 5 can be E.  
  Check if “STEEP” is valid: yes, it is a word.

Let’s try “STEEP”:
- S in position 1 (✓).  
- T in position 2 (was ruled out for position 2, so this is invalid).  
Oops, T cannot be in position 2 (from stein feedback).  
Therefore “STEEP” is invalid.

Next candidate: “STOLE” – invalid (O out).  
Next: “STEAD” – D is new, A is out.  
Next: “STEWD” – invalid.  
Next: “STEAK” – K not ruled out, A out.  
Next: “STECK” – C not ruled out, K not ruled out.  
But we need to place T somewhere.  
Let’s try “STECK”:
- S(1) ✓, T(2) – but T cannot be in position 2 (from stein feedback).  
Invalid.

Next: “STETE” – invalid (E in position 5 is allowed, but T in position 4 is new).  
But “STETE” is not a valid word.

Next: “SUTLE” – invalid.

Next: “S_T_E_” – let’s try T in position 3: S _ T E _  
Possible: “SMOTE” – O out.  
“SWETE” – invalid.  
“SPITE” – P new, I out.  
“SKYTE” – invalid.  
“SHYTE” – invalid.  
“STETE” – invalid.

Next: T in position 5: S _ _ E T  
Possible: “SCETE” – invalid.  
“SLATE” – L new, A out.  
“SMOTE” – O out.  
“SPITE” – I out.  
“SWETE” – invalid.  
“SKYTE” – invalid.  
“SHYTE” – invalid.  
“SCETE” – invalid.

Hmm, seems limited. Let’s try “STEED” – D new, E in position 4, E in position 5 allowed.  
“STEED” is valid.  
Check letters: S(1) ✓, T(2) – but T cannot be in position 2.  
Invalid.

Next: “STELA” – A out.  
“STELC” – invalid.

Next: “STEAK” – A out.  
“STECK” – T in position 2 invalid.

Next: “STEPE” – P new, E in position 4, E in position 5 allowed.  
“STEPE” is valid.  
Check T placement: T must be in position 3 or 5.  
“STEPE” has T in position 2 – invalid.

Next: “STEVE” – V new, E in position 4, E in position 5 allowed.  
“STEVE” is valid.  
T is in position 2 – invalid.

Next: “STETE” – invalid.

Next: “STEDE” – D new, E in position 4, E in position 5 allowed.  
“STEDE” is valid.  
T in position 2 – invalid.

Next: “STETE” – invalid.

Next: “STETE” – invalid.

Next: “STETE” – invalid.

Wait, let’s list possible positions:
S _ _ E _
T must be in position 3 or 5.

Case 1: T in position 3 → S _ T E _
Possible: “SUTTE” – invalid.  
“SMYTE” – invalid.  
“SWYTE” – invalid.  
“SKYTE” – invalid.  
“SHYTE” – invalid.  
“SCUTE” – C new, U new, E in position 5 allowed.  
“SCUTE” is valid.

Check letters: S(1) ✓, C new, U new, T(3) allowed, E(4) ✓, E(5) allowed.  
This seems valid.

Case 2: T in position 5 → S _ _ E T  
Possible: “SUTET” – invalid.  
“SMETE” – invalid.  
“SPETE” – invalid.  
“SWETE” – invalid.  
“SKETE” – invalid.  
“SHETE” – invalid.  
“SCETE” – invalid.

So the only valid candidate seems “SCUTE”.

Check:
- S(1) ✓  
- C new  
- U new  
- T(3) allowed (was only ruled out for position 2)  
- E(4) ✓  
- E(5) allowed  

“SCUTE” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s go with “SCUTE”.

From the new feedback on “scute”:

- S is still correct in position 1 (✓).  
- T is now correct in position 4 (✓).  
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).  
- C and U are not in the word (x).

So the secret word now looks like:  
S _ _ T _  
Letters known to be in the word: S, T, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, I, N, C, U  

Positions ruled out so far for E:  
- arose: E not in position 5  
- stein: E not in position 3  
- scute: E not in position 5  

Therefore E must be in position 2 or position 3.

Case 1: E in position 2 → S E _ T _  
Case 2: E in position 3 → S _ E T _  

We need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O, I, N, C, U) and ensuring the word is valid.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s explore both cases.

Case 1: S E _ T _  
Possible letters for position 3 and 5 (must be from remaining letters).  
Example: S E B T _ → “SEBTE” invalid.  
S E L T _ → “SELTE” invalid.  
S E D T _ → “SEDET” invalid.  
S E G T _ → “SEGTE” invalid.  
S E L T Y → “SELT Y” invalid.  
S E L T A → A is out.  
S E L T H → “SELTH” invalid.  
S E L T P → “SELT P” invalid.  
S E L T D → “SELTD” invalid.  
S E L T F → “SELTF” invalid.  
S E L T G → “SEL TG” invalid.  
S E L T H → “SELTH” invalid.  
S E L T M → “SEL TM” invalid.  
S E L T V → “SEL TV” invalid.  
S E L T W → “SEL TW” invalid.  
S E L T Y → “SELTY” invalid.  
S E L T Z → “SEL TZ” invalid.  
Seems no valid words in this case.

Case 2: S _ E T _  
Position 2 and 5 need letters from remaining pool.  
Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Try common combinations:  
S B E T _ → “SBET_” invalid.  
S D E T _ → “SDET_” invalid.  
S F E T _ → “SFE T_” invalid.  
S G E T _ → “SGET_” invalid.  
S H E T _ → “SHE T_” invalid.  
S L E T _ → “SLET_” invalid.  
S M E T _ → “SMET_” invalid.  
S P E T _ → “SPE T_” invalid.  
S V E T _ → “SVE T_” invalid.  
S W E T _ → “SWE T_” invalid.  
S Y E T _ → “SYET_” invalid.  
S Z E T _ → “SZE T_” invalid.

Wait, let’s think of actual words fitting S _ E T _:

- “SHELF” – F new, H new, L new, but E is in position 3 (allowed), T in position 4 (correct).  
Check letters: S, H, E, L, F.  
- A, R, O, I, N, C, U are all excluded.  
- E is in position 3 (allowed).  
- T is in position 4 (correct).  
- S is in position 1 (correct).  
- H, L, F are new letters not yet ruled out.  
“SHELF” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s verify:
- S(1) ✓  
- H(2) new  
- E(3) allowed (was only ruled out for positions 3 and 5 in previous guesses, but here it’s in position 3 and was marked “-” in scute, so position 3 is allowed for E? Wait, no: in scute, E was in position 5 and marked “-”, not position 3. In stein, E was in position 3 and marked “-”. In arose, E was in position 5 and marked “-”. So E cannot be in positions 3 or 5, but can be in 2 or 4. Position 4 is T, so E must be in position 2.  

Wait, let’s re-examine:

From all feedback:
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from stein and arose).  
- E cannot be in position 5 (from scute).  
- Position 4 is T, so E must be in position 2.  

Therefore the word must be S E _ T _.

But earlier we couldn’t find valid words for S E _ T _. Let me re-examine.

Possible letters for position 3 and 5 (must be from remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.).

Try:
- S E B T _ → “SEBTE” invalid.  
- S E D T _ → “SEDET” invalid.  
- S E F T _ → “SEFT_” invalid.  
- S E G T _ → “SEGTE” invalid.  
- S E H T _ → “SEHT_” invalid.  
- S E L T _ → “SELT_” invalid.  
- S E M T _ → “SEM T_” invalid.  
- S E P T _ → “SEPT_” invalid.  
- S E V T _ → “SEVT_” invalid.  
- S E W T _ → “SEWT_” invalid.  
- S E Y T _ → “SEYT_” invalid.  
- S E Z T _ → “SEZT_” invalid.

Hmm, seems no valid words fit S E _ T _. Let me think differently: perhaps I missed some letters.

Wait, remaining letters include D, L, M, P, B, G, H, F, V, W, Y, etc.

Let me try “SEPTA” – but A is out.  
“SEPTI” – I is out.  
“SEPTU” – U is out.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many letters early on. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This will give me maximum information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O are not in the word at all (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- Contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

Next, I need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes S and E somewhere (but not in positions 4 and 5).
- Excludes A, R, O.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

A strong candidate is ""STEIN"":
- Contains S and E (not in positions 4/5).
- Uses T, I, N which are common and not yet ruled out.
- No A, R, or O.

From the new feedback on “stein”:

- S is now confirmed in position 1 (✓).  
- T is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
- E is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
- I and N are not in the word at all (x).  

So the secret word looks like:  
S _ _ _ _  
Letters known to be in the word: S, T, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, I, N  
Positions ruled out so far:  
- S cannot be in position 2 (already fixed in position 1).  
- T cannot be in position 2.  
- E cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from arose and stein).  
  – From arose: E was in position 5 and marked “-” (wrong position).  
  – From stein: E was in position 3 and marked “-” (wrong position).  
  Therefore E must be in position 4.

Current partial word: S _ _ E _

Letters left to place: T (must go in position 3 or 5).  
E is already in position 4.

Remaining common letters not yet used: C, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

Candidate words:
- S T _ E _ → “STE__” – possible “STEEP” (but P not yet ruled out), “STOLE” (but O is out), “STOLE” invalid.  
- S _ T E _ → “S_T_E_” – possible “SUTLE” (not valid), “SMOTE” (O out), “SWETE” (invalid).  
- “STOLE” invalid because O is out.  
- “STEEL” – but E is already in position 4, so position 5 can’t be E (no duplicate info yet).  
- “STEEP” – E is already in position 4, so position 5 can be E.  
  Check if “STEEP” is valid: yes, it is a word.

Let’s try “STEEP”:
- S in position 1 (✓).  
- T in position 2 (was ruled out for position 2, so this is invalid).  
Oops, T cannot be in position 2 (from stein feedback).  
Therefore “STEEP” is invalid.

Next candidate: “STOLE” – invalid (O out).  
Next: “STEAD” – D is new, A is out.  
Next: “STEWD” – invalid.  
Next: “STEAK” – K not ruled out, A out.  
Next: “STECK” – C not ruled out, K not ruled out.  
But we need to place T somewhere.  
Let’s try “STECK”:
- S(1) ✓, T(2) – but T cannot be in position 2 (from stein feedback).  
Invalid.

Next: “STETE” – invalid (E in position 5 is allowed, but T in position 4 is new).  
But “STETE” is not a valid word.

Next: “SUTLE” – invalid.

Next: “S_T_E_” – let’s try T in position 3: S _ T E _  
Possible: “SMOTE” – O out.  
“SWETE” – invalid.  
“SPITE” – P new, I out.  
“SKYTE” – invalid.  
“SHYTE” – invalid.  
“STETE” – invalid.

Next: T in position 5: S _ _ E T  
Possible: “SCETE” – invalid.  
“SLATE” – L new, A out.  
“SMOTE” – O out.  
“SPITE” – I out.  
“SWETE” – invalid.  
“SKYTE” – invalid.  
“SHYTE” – invalid.  
“SCETE” – invalid.

Hmm, seems limited. Let’s try “STEED” – D new, E in position 4, E in position 5 allowed.  
“STEED” is valid.  
Check letters: S(1) ✓, T(2) – but T cannot be in position 2.  
Invalid.

Next: “STELA” – A out.  
“STELC” – invalid.

Next: “STEAK” – A out.  
“STECK” – T in position 2 invalid.

Next: “STEPE” – P new, E in position 4, E in position 5 allowed.  
“STEPE” is valid.  
Check T placement: T must be in position 3 or 5.  
“STEPE” has T in position 2 – invalid.

Next: “STEVE” – V new, E in position 4, E in position 5 allowed.  
“STEVE” is valid.  
T is in position 2 – invalid.

Next: “STETE” – invalid.

Next: “STEDE” – D new, E in position 4, E in position 5 allowed.  
“STEDE” is valid.  
T in position 2 – invalid.

Next: “STETE” – invalid.

Next: “STETE” – invalid.

Next: “STETE” – invalid.

Wait, let’s list possible positions:
S _ _ E _
T must be in position 3 or 5.

Case 1: T in position 3 → S _ T E _
Possible: “SUTTE” – invalid.  
“SMYTE” – invalid.  
“SWYTE” – invalid.  
“SKYTE” – invalid.  
“SHYTE” – invalid.  
“SCUTE” – C new, U new, E in position 5 allowed.  
“SCUTE” is valid.

Check letters: S(1) ✓, C new, U new, T(3) allowed, E(4) ✓, E(5) allowed.  
This seems valid.

Case 2: T in position 5 → S _ _ E T  
Possible: “SUTET” – invalid.  
“SMETE” – invalid.  
“SPETE” – invalid.  
“SWETE” – invalid.  
“SKETE” – invalid.  
“SHETE” – invalid.  
“SCETE” – invalid.

So the only valid candidate seems “SCUTE”.

Check:
- S(1) ✓  
- C new  
- U new  
- T(3) allowed (was only ruled out for position 2)  
- E(4) ✓  
- E(5) allowed  

“SCUTE” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s go with “SCUTE”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many letters early on. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This will give me maximum information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O are not in the word at all (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- Contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

Next, I need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes S and E somewhere (but not in positions 4 and 5).
- Excludes A, R, O.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

A strong candidate is ""STEIN"":
- Contains S and E (not in positions 4/5).
- Uses T, I, N which are common and not yet ruled out.

- S _ T E _ → “S_T_E_” – possible “SUTLE” (not valid), “SMOTE” (O out), “SWETE” (invalid).  
- “STOLE” invalid because O is out.  
- “STEEL” – but E is already in position 4, so position 5 can’t be E (no duplicate info yet).  
- “STEEP” – E is already in position 4, so position 5 can be E.  
  Check if “STEEP” is valid: yes, it is a word.

Let’s try “STEEP”:
- S in position 1 (✓).  
- T in position 2 (was ruled out for position 2, so this is invalid).  
Oops, T cannot be in position 2 (from stein feedback).  
Therefore “STEEP” is invalid.

Next candidate: “STOLE” – invalid (O out).  
Next: “STEAD” – D is new, A is out.  
Next: “STEWD” – invalid.  
Next: “STEAK” – K not ruled out, A out.  
Next: “STECK” – C not ruled out, K not ruled out.  
But we need to place T somewhere.  
Let’s try “STECK”:
- S(1) ✓, T(2) – but T cannot be in position 2 (from stein feedback).  
Invalid.

Next: “STETE” – invalid (E in position 5 is allowed, but T in position 4 is new).  
But “STETE” is not a valid word.

Next: “SUTLE” – invalid.

Next: “S_T_E_” – let’s try T in position 3: S _ T E _  
Possible: “SMOTE” – O out.  
“SWETE” – invalid.  
“SPITE” – P new, I out.  
“SKYTE” – invalid.  
“SHYTE” – invalid.  
“STETE” – invalid.

Next: T in position 5: S _ _ E T  
Possible: “SCETE” – invalid.  
“SLATE” – L new, A out.  
“SMOTE” – O out.  
“SPITE” – I out.  
“SWETE” – invalid.  
“SKYTE” – invalid.  
“SHYTE” – invalid.  
“SCETE” – invalid.

Hmm, seems limited. Let’s try “STEED” – D new, E in position 4, E in position 5 allowed.  
“STEED” is valid.  
Check letters: S(1) ✓, T(2) – but T cannot be in position 2.  
Invalid.

Next: “STELA” – A out.  
“STELC” – invalid.

Next: “STEAK” – A out.  
“STECK” – T in position 2 invalid.

Next: “STEPE” – P new, E in position 4, E in position 5 allowed.  
“STEPE” is valid.  
Check T placement: T must be in position 3 or 5.  
“STEPE” has T in position 2 – invalid.

Next: “STEVE” – V new, E in position 4, E in position 5 allowed.  
“STEVE” is valid.  
T is in position 2 – invalid.

Next: “STETE” – invalid.

Next: “STEDE” – D new, E in position 4, E in position 5 allowed.  
“STEDE” is valid.  
T in position 2 – invalid.

Next: “STETE” – invalid.

Next: “STETE” – invalid.

Next: “STETE” – invalid.

Wait, let’s list possible positions:
S _ _ E _
T must be in position 3 or 5.

Case 1: T in position 3 → S _ T E _
Possible: “SUTTE” – invalid.  
“SMYTE” – invalid.  
“SWYTE” – invalid.  
“SKYTE” – invalid.  
“SHYTE” – invalid.  
“SCUTE” – C new, U new, E in position 5 allowed.  
“SCUTE” is valid.

Check letters: S(1) ✓, C new, U new, T(3) allowed, E(4) ✓, E(5) allowed.  
This seems valid.

Case 2: T in position 5 → S _ _ E T  
Possible: “SUTET” – invalid.  
“SMETE” – invalid.  
“SPETE” – invalid.  
“SWETE” – invalid.  
“SKETE” – invalid.  
“SHETE” – invalid.  
“SCETE” – invalid.

So the only valid candidate seems “SCUTE”.

Check:
- S(1) ✓  
- C new  
- U new  
- T(3) allowed (was only ruled out for position 2)  
- E(4) ✓  
- E(5) allowed  

“SCUTE” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s go with “SCUTE”.

From the new feedback on “scute”:

- S(1) ✓  → fixed in position 1  
- C(x) → C is not in the word  
- U(x) → U is not in the word  
- T(4) ✓  → fixed in position 4  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5  

So the pattern is now:  
S _ _ T E  → but E cannot be in position 5 (from arose and scute feedback).  
Wait, let’s re-examine the feedback:

- arose: E(-) in position 5 → E not in position 5  
- stein: E(-) in position 3 → E not in position 3  
- scute: E(-) in position 5 → E not in position 5 (redundant)  

Therefore E must be in position 2 or 3.  
But from arose, E was in position 5 (-) → not 5  
From stein, E was in position 3 (-) → not 3  
From scute, E was in position 5 (-) → not 5  

So E must be in position 2.

Current pattern:  
S E _ T _  

Letters known to be in the word: S, T, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, I, N, C, U  

Remaining common letters: D, L, M, P, H, Y, etc.  

Possible positions for the remaining two letters (positions 3 and 5):  
Need two distinct letters from the allowed set, forming a valid word.

Candidate words:
- S E D T _ → “SEDTE” invalid  
- S E L T _ → “SELTE” invalid  
- S E M T _ → “SEMTE” invalid  
- S E P T _ → “SEPT_” – “SEPTA” (A out), “SEPTI” (I out), “SEPTU” (U out), “SEPT_” – “SEPT” + ?  
- S E L T _ → “SELT_” – “SELTZ” invalid  
- S E L T _ → “SELT_” – “SELT” + ?  
- S E L T _ → “SELT” + ? – “SELT” + “Z” invalid  
- S E L T _ → “SELT” + “Z” invalid  

Wait, let’s list valid words fitting S E _ T _ with allowed letters.

Valid words:  
- “SEPTA” – A out  
- “SEPTI” – I out  
- “SEPTU” – U out  
- “SEPT_” – “SEPT” + ? – “SEPT” + “A” invalid, “SEPT” + “I” invalid, “SEPT” + “U” invalid  
- “SEPT” + “Y” – “SEPTY” – valid word meaning “sulfurous” or “smelly”  

Check “SEPTY”:
- S(1) ✓  
- E(2) ✓  
- P new  
- T(4) ✓  
- Y new  
Letters used: S, E, P, T, Y – none of the forbidden letters (A, R, O, I, N, C, U).  

Thus “SEPTY” fits perfectly.
