### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters might be in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly more balanced. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters might be in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly more balanced. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(✓) – A is correct and in the first position.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. Word starts with A.
2. R, O, E are not in the word.
3. S is somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Begins with A.
- Contains S in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).
- Does not contain R, O, or E.

Possible candidates:
- ASIDE – but E is excluded.
- ASKIN – uses S in position 2, no R/O/E.
- ASTON – uses S in position 2, no R/O/E.
- ASHES – uses S in position 2 and 5, but has E.
- ABBOT – doesn’t have S.
- AULIC – doesn’t have S.
- ABBOT – no S.
- ABBOT – no S.

Best fit seems ASKIN (A S K I N). It fits all constraints: starts with A, has S in position 2, no R/O/E.

3. S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from ASKIN) and NOT in position 4 (from AROSE).  
   So S must be in position 3 or 5.

Letters still allowed (excluding the five ruled out above):  
A, S, and the remaining alphabet minus those five.

We need a 5-letter word beginning with A, containing S in position 3 or 5, and using only the remaining letters.

Candidate pool:
- A _ S _ _  (S in 3rd)
- A _ _ _ S  (S in 5th)

Possible words:
- ADOBS – uses B, D, O, S; but O is excluded.
- AFTSY – uses F, T, Y; S is in 5th, no excluded letters.
- AGING – uses G, I, N; I and N are excluded.
- ALAS – too short.
- ABBOT – no S.
- AULIC – no S.
- ADOBS – O excluded.
- AFTSY – seems valid: A F T S Y; S is in 5th position, no forbidden letters.

Another check: AFTSY is a recognized 5-letter word (variant spelling of “afrit” or slang for “afraid”).

3. S(-) appeared in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from ASKIN, AFTSY, ABASH) – but never in position 1.  
   This means S must be in position 3 or 5 (the only remaining open spots).
4. A(-) in position 3 of ABASH tells us the second A is not in position 3, so the word has only one A (since the first letter is already A).  
   Therefore, the word is of the form: A _ _ _ _ with exactly one A and S somewhere in positions 3 or 5.

Remaining allowed letters (excluding all ruled-out ones):

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters might be in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly more balanced. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(✓) – A is correct and in the first position.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. Word starts with A.
2. R, O, E are not in the word.
3. S is somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Begins with A.
- Contains S in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).
- Does not contain R, O, or E.

Possible candidates:
- ASIDE – but E is excluded.
- ASKIN – uses S in position 2, no R/O/E.
- ASTON – uses S in position 2, no R/O/E.
- ASHES – uses S in position 2 and 5, but has E.
- ABBOT – doesn’t have S.
- AULIC – doesn’t have S.
- ABBOT – no S.
- ABBOT – no S.

Best fit seems ASKIN (A S K I N). It fits all constraints: starts with A, has S in position 2, no R/O/E.

Guess 2: ASKIN -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) S(-) K(x) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A(✓) – the word starts with A.
2. R, O, E, K, I, N are all absent.
3. S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from ASKIN) and NOT in position 4 (from AROSE).  
   So S must be in position 3 or 5.

Letters still allowed (excluding the five ruled out above):  
A, S, and the remaining alphabet minus those five.

We need a 5-letter word beginning with A, containing S in position 3 or 5, and using only the remaining letters.

Candidate pool:
- A _ S _ _  (S in 3rd)
- A _ _ _ S  (S in 5th)

Possible words:
- ADOBS – uses B, D, O, S; but O is excluded.
- AFTSY – uses F, T, Y; S is in 5th, no excluded letters.
- AGING – uses G, I, N; I and N are excluded.
- ALAS – too short.
- ABBOT – no S.
- AULIC – no S.
- ADOBS – O excluded.
- AFTSY – seems valid: A F T S Y; S is in 5th position, no forbidden letters.

Another check: AFTSY is a recognized 5-letter word (variant spelling of “afrit” or slang for “afraid”).  
Let’s go with AFTSY to test S in the 5th position and new letters F, T, Y.

Current constraints:
- Word starts with A (A✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from ASKIN, AFTSY, and AROSE feedback).  
  This is impossible unless I misread. Let’s re-examine:
  – ASKIN: S(-) → S not in position 2.
  – AFTSY: S(-) → S not in position 4.
  – AROSE: S(-) → S not in position 4 (already known).
  So S must be in position 3 or 5.  
  Guess 3 AFTSY shows S in position 4 marked “-” → S is not in position 4, but we already knew that.  
  We still need S in position 3 or 5.

Letters ruled out so far: R, O, E, K, I, N, F, T, Y.

Remaining letters: A, B, C, D, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S in position 3 or 5, and using only the remaining letters.

Candidate list:
- A _ S _ _  (S in 3rd)
  – ABLAS – uses L, B, A, S; but A is already known, and we have no info on B or L yet.
  – ACHES – E is excluded.
  – ACIDS – I, D excluded.
  – AGARS – R excluded.
  – AMASS – M, S, A; S is in 3rd and 5th; uses M and A (A already known).  
    AMASS: A M A S S → starts with A, S in 3rd and 5th, uses only allowed letters.

- A _ _ _ S  (S in 5th)
  – ABBAS – S not in 5th here.
  – ABACI – I excluded.
  – ABDOM – O excluded.
  – ABAND – N excluded.
  – ABASE – E excluded.
  – ABASH – H allowed, but S is in 5th.  
    ABASH: A B A S H → starts with A, S in 5th, uses B and H (both allowed).

Between AMASS and ABASH:
- AMASS: S in 3rd and 5th; uses M (new letter).
- ABASH: S in 5th; uses B and H (both new).

ABASH introduces two new letters (B, H) while AMASS introduces one new letter (M).  
Let’s choose ABASH to test B and H.

Let's update what we now know after the four guesses.

1. A(✓) – word starts with A.
2. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, K, I, N, F, T, Y, B, H.
3. S(-) appeared in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from ASKIN, AFTSY, ABASH) – but never in position 1.  
   This means S must be in position 3 or 5 (the only remaining open spots).
4. A(-) in position 3 of ABASH tells us the second A is not in position 3, so the word has only one A (since the first letter is already A).  
   Therefore, the word is of the form: A _ _ _ _ with exactly one A and S somewhere in positions 3 or 5.

Remaining allowed letters (excluding all ruled-out ones):  
C, D, G, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S in position 3 or 5, and using only the remaining letters.

Candidate list:
- A _ S _ _  (S in 3rd)
  – AULIC – I excluded.
  – AULDS – D, S allowed; AULDS is valid.
  – AMISS – I, S in 5th, but I excluded.
  – AGING – I, N excluded.
  – AULDS – A U L D S: uses U, L, D (all allowed), S in 3rd.

From the latest feedback we now know:

- S is in the word and is now confirmed in position 5 (S✓).
- Letters ruled out so far: R, O, E, K, I, N, F, T, Y, B, H, U, L, D.

So the pattern is: A _ _ _ S

Remaining letters that can still appear (excluding all the ruled-out ones): C, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A.
2. Ends with S.
3. Uses only the remaining letters in positions 2, 3, 4.

Let's list possible combinations:

Position 2: C, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Position 3: C, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Position 4: C, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Possible words:
