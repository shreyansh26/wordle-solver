For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A common strategy is to use words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels quickly.
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in English words.
3. The letters are all distinct, maximizing the chance of getting hits.

This should give me good initial feedback about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters known to be in the word: O, S, E
   - Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, P, D

2. POSED → P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - E is confirmed in position 4.
   - S is still in the word but NOT in position 3.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ O _ S _ E (but S cannot be in position 3)
- Letters to place: S, plus any others not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2 and E in position 4.
- Contains S somewhere other than position 3.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns: _ O _ S _ E or _ O _ _ S E (but S must be in the word, so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5).

Looking for common words that fit:
- ""JOUSE"" – but J is uncommon.
- ""LOOSE"" – double O, but we already have O in position 2.
- ""COVES"" – but E is in position 4, so this doesn't fit.
- ""NOISE"" – fits: N O I S E. Let's check:
   - N: not ruled out
   - O: position 2 ✓
   - I: not ruled out
   - S: position 4 (not position 3) ✓
   - E: position 5 (but we know E must be in position 4) – doesn't fit.

Wait, the pattern is _ O _ _ S E? No, we know E is in position 4. So the pattern must be _ O _ E S, but that would put S in position 5, which is allowed. But we have to confirm if that's possible.

Actually, the pattern is _ O _ _ _ with E in position 4 and S somewhere else. Let me re-express:

Known:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- S must be in the word, but not in position 3.

So possible positions for S: 1, 5.

Possible words:
- ""SOUSE"" – S O U S E: S in position 1 and 4, but E is in position 4, so this would have S in 4, but E is in 4 – conflict.
- ""COVES"" – C O V E S: fits _ O _ E S, S in position 5. But we know E is in position 4, so this would be C O V E S – but E is in position 4, so this is C O V E S – but then S is in position 5. This seems to fit:
   - C: not ruled out
   - O: position 2 ✓
   - V: not ruled out
   - E: position 4 ✓
   - S: position 5 (not position 3) ✓

This looks valid. Let me check if there are better options.

Another option: ""GOOSE"" – G O O S E: but O is already in position 2, and we have a double O, which might be possible, but we have no info against it. However, we know S must be in position 5 here, which is allowed.

Between ""COVES"" and ""GOOSE"", ""COVES"" seems more likely as it uses common letters.

But let me think again: the feedback from POSED showed S is in the word but not in position 3. So S could be in 1, 4, or 5. However, from POSED, S was in position 3 and got ""-"", so S is not in position 3. From AROSE, S was in position 4 and got ""-"", so S is not in position 4. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 5.

Given that, possible patterns:
- S O _ _ E (but E must be in position 4, so this is S O _ E _)
- _ O _ _ E with S in position 5: _ O _ _ S E (but E is in position 4, so this is _ O _ E S)

So the pattern is either:
- S O _ E _
- _ O _ E S

Looking for words:
- ""SO..."" with E in position 4: S O _ E _ – ""SOUSE"" but that has S in 1 and 4, but E is in 4, so conflict.
- ""...OSE"" with S in 5: _ O _ E S – ""COVES"" fits: C O V E S.

This seems correct.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- E is confirmed in position 4.
- S must be in the word but not in positions 3 or 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5.
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, P, D.

The pattern _ O _ E S fits with S in position 5. A valid word is ""COVES"".

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A common strategy is to use words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels quickly.
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in English words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word contains O, S, E, but not A or R.
2. O, S, E are each in the word but not in their original positions (3rd, 4th, 5th respectively).

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses O, S, E in new positions.
- Avoids A and R.
- Introduces other common consonants to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is ""POSED"":
- P: new consonant
- O: moved to 2nd position (originally 3rd)
- S: moved to 3rd position (originally 4th)
- E: moved to 4th position (originally 5th)
- D: new consonant

This tests the new positions of O, S, E and adds two new letters (P, D) to gather more information.

Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters known to be in the word: O, S, E
   - Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, P, D

2. POSED → P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - E is confirmed in position 4.
   - S is still in the word but NOT in position 3.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ O _ S _ E (but S cannot be in position 3)
- Letters to place: S, plus any others not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2 and E in position 4.
- Contains S somewhere other than position 3.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns: _ O _ S _ E or _ O _ _ S E (but S must be in the word, so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5).

Looking for common words that fit:
- ""JOUSE"" – but J is uncommon.
- ""LOOSE"" – double O, but we already have O in position 2.
- ""COVES"" – but E is in position 4, so this doesn't fit.
- ""NOISE"" – fits: N O I S E. Let's check:
   - N: not ruled out
   - O: position 2 ✓
   - I: not ruled out
   - S: position 4 (not position 3) ✓
   - E: position 5 (but we know E must be in position 4) – doesn't fit.

Wait, the pattern is _ O _ _ S E? No, we know E is in position 4. So the pattern must be _ O _ E S, but that would put S in position 5, which is allowed. But we have to confirm if that's possible.

Actually, the pattern is _ O _ _ _ with E in position 4 and S somewhere else. Let me re-express:

Known:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- S must be in the word, but not in position 3.

So possible positions for S: 1, 5.

Possible words:
- ""SOUSE"" – S O U S E: S in position 1 and 4, but E is in position 4, so this would have S in 4, but E is in 4 – conflict.
- ""COVES"" – C O V E S: fits _ O _ E S, S in position 5. But we know E is in position 4, so this would be C O V E S – but E is in position 4, so this is C O V E S – but then S is in position 5. This seems to fit:
   - C: not ruled out
   - O: position 2 ✓
   - V: not ruled out
   - E: position 4 ✓
   - S: position 5 (not position 3) ✓

This looks valid. Let me check if there are better options.

Another option: ""GOOSE"" – G O O S E: but O is already in position 2, and we have a double O, which might be possible, but we have no info against it. However, we know S must be in position 5 here, which is allowed.

Between ""COVES"" and ""GOOSE"", ""COVES"" seems more likely as it uses common letters.

But let me think again: the feedback from POSED showed S is in the word but not in position 3. So S could be in 1, 4, or 5. However, from POSED, S was in position 3 and got ""-"", so S is not in position 3. From AROSE, S was in position 4 and got ""-"", so S is not in position 4. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 5.

Given that, possible patterns:
- S O _ _ E (but E must be in position 4, so this is S O _ E _)
- _ O _ _ E with S in position 5: _ O _ _ S E (but E is in position 4, so this is _ O _ E S)

So the pattern is either:
- S O _ E _
- _ O _ E S

Looking for words:
- ""SO..."" with E in position 4: S O _ E _ – ""SOUSE"" but that has S in 1 and 4, but E is in 4, so conflict.
- ""...OSE"" with S in 5: _ O _ E S – ""COVES"" fits: C O V E S.

This seems correct.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- E is confirmed in position 4.
- S must be in the word but not in positions 3 or 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5.
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, P, D.

The pattern _ O _ E S fits with S in position 5. A valid word is ""COVES"".

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A common strategy is to use words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels quickly.
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in English words.

  – S is in position 5 (✓ in COVES)

- Letters known NOT to be in the word:
  A, R, P, D, C, V

So the pattern so far is: _ O _ E S

Letters still allowed: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Has E in position 4
- Has S in position 5
- Uses only the allowed letters in positions 1 and 3

Looking for common words that fit _ O _ E S:

Possible candidates:
- ""FOGES"" – but FOGES is not a valid English word.
- ""GOLES"" – GOLES is a valid word (plural of gale, or a type of sand).
- ""HOSES"" – HOSES is valid (plural of hose).
- ""JOYES"" – JOYES is not a common word.
- ""LODES"" – LODES is valid (plural of lode).
- ""MOLES"" – MOLES is valid.
- ""NOSES"" – NOSES is valid.
- ""POSES"" – but P is already ruled out.
- ""ROSES"" – but R is ruled out.
- ""SOLES"" – SOLES is valid.
- ""WOSES"" – not a common word.

Among these, ""NOSES"", ""MOLES"", ""HOSES"", ""LODES"", ""GOLES"", ""SOLES"" are all valid. 

Choosing one that uses common letters: ""MOLES"" uses M, O, L, E, S – all letters are allowed and it's a common word.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A common strategy is to use words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

""AROSE"" is particularly good because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels quickly.
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in English words.
3. The letters are all distinct, maximizing the chance of getting hits.

This should give me good initial feedback about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word contains O, S, E, but not A or R.
2. O, S, E are each in the word but not in their original positions (3rd, 4th, 5th respectively).

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses O, S, E in new positions.
- Avoids A and R.
- Introduces other common consonants to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is ""POSED"":
- P: new consonant
- O: moved to 2nd position (originally 3rd)
- S: moved to 3rd position (originally 4th)
- E: moved to 4th position (originally 5th)
- D: new consonant

This tests the new positions of O, S, E and adds two new letters (P, D) to gather more information.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters known to be in the word: O, S, E
   - Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, P, D

2. POSED → P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - E is confirmed in position 4.
   - S is still in the word but NOT in position 3.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ O _ S _ E (but S cannot be in position 3)
- Letters to place: S, plus any others not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2 and E in position 4.
- Contains S somewhere other than position 3.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns: _ O _ S _ E or _ O _ _ S E (but S must be in the word, so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5).

Looking for common words that fit:
- ""JOUSE"" – but J is uncommon.
- ""LOOSE"" – double O, but we already have O in position 2.
- ""COVES"" – but E is in position 4, so this doesn't fit.
- ""NOISE"" – fits: N O I S E. Let's check:
   - N: not ruled out
   - O: position 2 ✓
   - I: not ruled out
   - S: position 4 (not position 3) ✓
   - E: position 5 (but we know E must be in position 4) – doesn't fit.

Wait, the pattern is _ O _ _ S E? No, we know E is in position 4. So the pattern must be _ O _ E S, but that would put S in position 5, which is allowed. But we have to confirm if that's possible.

Actually, the pattern is _ O _ _ _ with E in position 4 and S somewhere else. Let me re-express:

Known:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- S must be in the word, but not in position 3.

So possible positions for S: 1, 5.

Possible words:
- ""SOUSE"" – S O U S E: S in position 1 and 4, but E is in position 4, so this would have S in 4, but E is in 4 – conflict.
- ""COVES"" – C O V E S: fits _ O _ E S, S in position 5. But we know E is in position 4, so this would be C O V E S – but E is in position 4, so this is C O V E S – but then S is in position 5. This seems to fit:
   - C: not ruled out
   - O: position 2 ✓
   - V: not ruled out
   - E: position 4 ✓
   - S: position 5 (not position 3) ✓

This looks valid. Let me check if there are better options.

Another option: ""GOOSE"" – G O O S E: but O is already in position 2, and we have a double O, which might be possible, but we have no info against it. However, we know S must be in position 5 here, which is allowed.

Between ""COVES"" and ""GOOSE"", ""COVES"" seems more likely as it uses common letters.

But let me think again: the feedback from POSED showed S is in the word but not in position 3. So S could be in 1, 4, or 5. However, from POSED, S was in position 3 and got ""-"", so S is not in position 3. From AROSE, S was in position 4 and got ""-"", so S is not in position 4. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 5.

Given that, possible patterns:
- S O _ _ E (but E must be in position 4, so this is S O _ E _)
- _ O _ _ E with S in position 5: _ O _ _ S E (but E is in position 4, so this is _ O _ E S)

So the pattern is either:
- S O _ E _
- _ O _ E S

Looking for words:
- ""SO..."" with E in position 4: S O _ E _ – ""SOUSE"" but that has S in 1 and 4, but E is in 4, so conflict.
- ""...OSE"" with S in 5: _ O _ E S – ""COVES"" fits: C O V E S.

This seems correct.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- E is confirmed in position 4.
- S must be in the word but not in positions 3 or 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5.
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, P, D.

The pattern _ O _ E S fits with S in position 5. A valid word is ""COVES"".

Known absent letters: A, R, P, D, C, V, M, L

So the pattern is: _ O _ E S

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 3 (from the alphabet excluding the absent ones):
B, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ?O?ES.

Common words fitting this pattern:
- BOGES – not valid
- FOGE? – none fit
- GOES? – GOES is 4 letters
- HOSES – valid
- JONES – too long
- KNOES – not valid
- NOES? – NOES is 4 letters
- NOVES – not valid
- TOES? – TOES is 4 letters
- WOES? – WOES is 4 letters

Valid 5-letter words:
- HOSES – H O S E S (but S is already in position 5)
- HOVES – but V is absent
- JONES – J O N E S – J, O, N, E, S – all letters allowed
- KNOES – not valid
- NOISE – N O I S E – fits _ O _ E S pattern (N O I S E)
- WOES? – no 5-letter form

""NOISE"" uses N (position 1), O (position 2), I (position 3), S (position 4), E (position 5) – but S must be in position 5, so this is invalid.

""JONES"" fits: J O N E S – positions: J(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). All letters allowed.

Another candidate: ""HOSES"" – H O S E S, but this has S in position 3 and E in position 4, but S must be in 5 and E in 4, so this is invalid.

Thus, the only valid candidate is ""JONES"".

No, we know E is in position 4. So the pattern must be _ O _ E S, but that would put S in position 5, which is allowed. But we have to confirm if that\'s possible.\n\nActually, the pattern is _ O _ _ _ with E in position 4 and S somewhere else. Let me re-express:\n\nKnown:\n- Position 2: O\n- Position 4: E\n- S must be in the word, but not in position 3.\n\nSo possible positions for S: 1, 5.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SOUSE"" – S O U S E: S in position 1 and 4, but E is in position 4, so this would have S in 4, but E is in 4 – conflict.\n- ""COVES"" – C O V E S: fits _ O _ E S, S in position 5. But we know E is in position 4, so this would be C O V E S – but E is in position 4, so this is C O V E S – but then S is in position 5. This seems to fit:\n   - C: not ruled out\n   - O: position 2 ✓\n   - V: not ruled out\n   - E: position 4 ✓\n   - S: position 5 (not position 3) ✓\n\nThis looks valid. Let me check if there are better options.\n\nAnother option: ""GOOSE"" – G O O S E: but O is already in position 2, and we have a double O, which might be possible, but we have no info against it. However, we know S must be in position 5 here, which is allowed.\n\nBetween ""COVES"" and ""GOOSE"", ""COVES"" seems more likely as it uses common letters.\n\nBut let me think again: the feedback from POSED showed S is in the word but not in position 3. So S could be in 1, 4, or 5. However, from POSED, S was in position 3 and got ""-"", so S is not in position 3. From AROSE, S was in position 4 and got ""-"", so S is not in position 4. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 5.\n\nGiven that, possible patterns:\n- S O _ _ E (but E must be in position 4, so this is S O _ E _)\n- _ O _ _ E with S in position 5: _ O _ _ S E (but E is in position 4, so this is _ O _ E S)\n\nSo the pattern is either:\n- S O _ E _\n- _ O _ E S\n\nLooking for words:\n- ""SO..."" with E in position 4: S O _ E _ – ""SOUSE"" but that has S in 1 and 4, but E is in 4, so conflict.\n- ""...OSE"" with S in 5: _ O _ E S – ""COVES"" fits: C O V E S.\n\nThis seems correct.Based on the feedback:\n- O is confirmed in position 2.\n- E is confirmed in position 4.\n- S must be in the word but not in positions 3 or 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5.\n- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, P, D.\n\nThe pattern _ O _ E S fits with S in position 5.

From the latest feedback (JONES):

- J(✓) → J is in position 1 and is correct.
- O(✓) → O is in position 2 and is correct.
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in position 4 and is correct.
- S(✓) → S is in position 5 and is correct.

So the pattern is now fully determined:

J O _ E S

We only need to find the correct letter for position 3.  
Letters already ruled out include: A, R, P, D, C, V, M, L, N.

Remaining possible letters for position 3 (from the alphabet excluding the ruled-out ones) are:  
B, F, G, H, I, K, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form J O ? E S.

Checking common words:

- JOBES – not valid
- JONES – already tried (N is wrong)
- JOKES – J O K E S – K is allowed and this is a valid word
- JOTES – J O T E S – T is allowed and this is valid
- JOUES – not valid
- JOVES – V is ruled out

Between JOKES and JOTES, both are valid, but JOKES is more common.
