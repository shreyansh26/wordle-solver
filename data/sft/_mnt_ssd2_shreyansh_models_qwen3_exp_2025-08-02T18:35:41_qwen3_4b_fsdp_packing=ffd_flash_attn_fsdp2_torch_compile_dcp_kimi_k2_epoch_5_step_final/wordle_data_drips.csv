For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AUDIO"". These words contain frequently used letters in English and can provide good initial feedback. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E (covers common consonants and vowels)
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E (similar coverage)
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E (good vowel coverage)
- AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O (heavy on vowels)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers common letters and vowels, giving good information about potential letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is not in the word at all.
- I is in the word and in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word has an I in the 3rd position.
2. It contains R and S, but R is not first and S is not fourth.
3. It does NOT contain A or E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- I in position 3
- R somewhere except position 1
- S somewhere except position 4
- No A or E

Possible candidates:
- SIRKS (but has K, which we don't know about)
- RISKS (R in position 1 is invalid)
- SPIRS (but has P, which we don't know about)
- PRISM (P unknown, but M unknown)
- TRISK (T unknown, K unknown)

Let's try ""TRISK"":
- T is unknown, but let's see if it fits
- R is in position 2 (valid, since R can't be first)
- I is in position 3 (matches)
- S is in position 4 (but feedback says S is not in position 4 - conflict)
So TRISK is invalid.

Next try ""PRISM"":
- P unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- S in position 4 (invalid, same conflict)
Invalid.

Next try ""SPIRS"":
- S in position 1 (valid)

This seems like a good next guess to test new letters (P and T) while respecting the constraints.

Based on the feedback:
- I is locked in position 3.
- R and S must appear somewhere, but R cannot be first and S cannot be fourth.
- A and E are eliminated.

A strong next guess is ""SPRIT"":
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- P and T are new letters to test

Let me process the new feedback from SPRIT:

- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 1.

- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3.
- I(-): I is in the word but not in position 4.

2. S must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from RAISE and SPRIT).
3. R must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from RAISE and SPRIT).
4. A, E, T are out.
5. P is in the word but cannot be in position 2.

So the word has:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AUDIO"". These words contain frequently used letters in English and can provide good initial feedback. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E (covers common consonants and vowels)
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E (similar coverage)
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E (good vowel coverage)
- AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O (heavy on vowels)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers common letters and vowels, giving good information about potential letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is not in the word at all.
- I is in the word and in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word has an I in the 3rd position.
2. It contains R and S, but R is not first and S is not fourth.
3. It does NOT contain A or E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- I in position 3
- R somewhere except position 1
- S somewhere except position 4
- No A or E

Possible candidates:
- SIRKS (but has K, which we don't know about)
- RISKS (R in position 1 is invalid)
- SPIRS (but has P, which we don't know about)
- PRISM (P unknown, but M unknown)
- TRISK (T unknown, K unknown)

Let's try ""TRISK"":
- T is unknown, but let's see if it fits
- R is in position 2 (valid, since R can't be first)
- I is in position 3 (matches)
- S is in position 4 (but feedback says S is not in position 4 - conflict)
So TRISK is invalid.

Next try ""PRISM"":
- P unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- S in position 4 (invalid, same conflict)
Invalid.

Next try ""SPIRS"":
- S in position 1 (valid)
- P unknown
- I in position 2 (but we need I in position 3 - conflict)
Invalid.

Next try ""RISKS"":
- R in position 1 (invalid, R can't be first)
Invalid.

Next try ""CRISP"":
- C unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- S in position 4 (invalid, S can't be fourth)
Invalid.

Next try ""BRISK"":
- B unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- S in position 4 (invalid, S can't be fourth)
Invalid.

Next try ""DRIPS"":
- D unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- S in position 4 (invalid)
Invalid.

Next try ""GRIST"":
- G unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- S in position 4 (invalid)
Invalid.

Next try ""FRISK"":
- F unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- S in position 4 (invalid)
Invalid.

Next try ""WRIST"":
- W unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- S in position 4 (invalid)
Invalid.

Next try ""CRISP"" already tried.

Next try ""DRIPS"" already tried.

Next try ""BRISK"" already tried.

Next try ""PRISM"" already tried.

Next try ""TRISK"" already tried.

Next try ""SPIRS"" already tried.

Next try ""SPRIT"":
- S in position 1 (valid)
- P unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- T unknown
- S is not in position 4, so this is valid.

So ""SPRIT"" seems valid:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- P unknown
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- T unknown

This seems like a good next guess to test new letters (P and T) while respecting the constraints.Based on the feedback:
- I is locked in position 3.
- R and S must appear somewhere, but R cannot be first and S cannot be fourth.
- A and E are eliminated.

A strong next guess is ""SPRIT"":
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- P and T are new letters to test
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- T is new

- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3.
- I(-): I is in the word but not in position 4.

2. S must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from RAISE and SPRIT).
3. R must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from RAISE and SPRIT).
4. A, E, T are out.
5. P is in the word but cannot be in position 2.

So the word has:

- R must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (since it can't be 1 or 3)

Let's consider possible placements:

  - If R is in 4, then P must be in 1 or 5
  - If R is in 5, then P must be in 1 or 4

Case 2: S in position 5
- Position 5: S
- Position 3: I
- R must be in position 2 or 4
- P must be in position 1, 2, 4 (but 2 or 4 might be taken by R)

Let's explore Case 1 first (S in 2, I in 3):
- Possible R positions: 4 or 5
  - R in 4: word is _ S I R _ 
    - P must be in 1 or 5
    - If P in 1: P S I R _ 
      - Need a 5th letter (not A, E, T, and not P, S, I, R)
      - Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
      - Need a valid 5-letter word: P S I R ? 
      - ""PSIR?"" doesn't seem valid. Maybe ""PSIRK"" but that's not common.
    - If P in 5: _ S I R P

Case 2: S in position 5
- Position 5: S
- Position 3: I
- R must be in position 2 or 4
  - R in 2: word is _ R I _ S
    - P must be in 1, 4 (since 3 is I, 2 is R, 5 is S)
    - If P in 1: P R I _ S
      - Need a 4th letter: ? R I ? S
      - ""PRI?S"" - possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
      - ""PRINS"" - but N is allowed. ""PRINS"" is a valid word (plural of prince, but 5 letters).
      - Check if PRINS is valid: Yes, ""PRINS"" is an accepted variant spelling in some dictionaries.
    - If P in 4: _ R I P S
      - Need a 1st letter: ? R I P S
      - ""ARIPS"" not valid (A out). ""BRIPS"" not valid. ""CRIPS"" is valid (plural of crimp). ""DRIPS"" is valid (but T is out). ""FRIPS"" not valid. ""GRIPS"" is valid. ""HRIPS"" not valid.

""ZRIPS"" not valid. So possible words: CRIPS, GRIPS.
  - R in 4: word is _ _ I R S
    - P must be in 1 or 2 (since 3 is I, 4 is R, 5 is S)
    - If P in 1: P _ I R S
      - Need a 2nd letter: ? I R S
      - ""PI?RS"" - possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
      - ""PILRS"" not valid. ""PINGRS"" too long. Doesn't seem possible.
    - If P in 2: _ P I R S

""ZPIRS"" not valid. Doesn't seem possible.

So the most promising candidates are:
- PRINS (but might be obscure)
- CRIPS
- GRIPS

Between these, CRIPS and GRIPS are more common. Let's choose CRIPS first.Based on the feedback:
- I is locked in position 3.
- S must be in position 2 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).
- R must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 3).
- P must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3).
- A, E, T are eliminated.

A valid word fitting these constraints is **CRIPS**.

From the new feedback on CRIPS:

So we now know the exact pattern:

Position 1: ?
Position 2: R
Position 3: I
Position 4: P
Position 5: S

We need a 5-letter word that matches the pattern _ R I P S.

Looking at the dictionary, the only common English word that fits this pattern is **BRIPS**, but that's not a valid word. The correct word is **PRIPS**, but that's also not valid. However, the only valid word is **CRIPS**, but C is already ruled out. 

Wait, let's think again. The pattern is _ R I P S. The valid word is **FRIPS**? No. Actually, the correct word is **DRIPS**, but D is allowed. Let me check:

- D is not used yet, so **DRIPS** fits the pattern D R I P S.

But let me confirm: D is allowed (not ruled out), R, I, P, S are all in the correct positions. So **DRIPS** is the word.

However, looking back at the feedback, T is already ruled out, but D hasn't been tested yet. 

But wait, let me think of other possibilities. The pattern is _ R I P S. The only valid English word that fits is **DRIPS**. 

But let me check if there are any others. **CRIPS** was already guessed, and C is out. **BRIPS** isn't valid. **FRIPS** isn't valid. **GRIPS** is G R I P S, which fits the pattern. 

So **GRIPS** is another valid word. Between **DRIPS** and **GRIPS**, both fit. 

But let me check the letters used so far. We know:
- A, E, T, C are out.
- R, I, P, S are in positions 2,3,4,5.

So possible first letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid words:
- **GRIPS** (G R I P S)
- **DRIPS** (D R I P S)

Both are valid, but **GRIPS** is more common. I'll go with **GRIPS**.

But wait, let me check if **GRIPS** is valid. Yes, **GRIPS** is a valid English word.

However, looking back at the feedback for CRIPS, P is in position 4 (✓), so P is correct. Similarly, R is in position 2 (✓), I in 3 (✓), S in 5 (✓). So the word must be _ R I P S.

The only valid words are **GRIPS** and **DRIPS**. I'll choose **GRIPS** as it's more common.

But let me think if there's any other. **FRIPS** isn't valid. **KRIPS** isn't valid. So the only two are **DRIPS** and **GRIPS**. 

I'll choose **GRIPS**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AUDIO"". These words contain frequently used letters in English and can provide good initial feedback. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E (covers common consonants and vowels)
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E (similar coverage)
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E (good vowel coverage)
- AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O (heavy on vowels)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers common letters and vowels, giving good information about potential letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is not in the word at all.
- I is in the word and in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word has an I in the 3rd position.
2. It contains R and S, but R is not first and S is not fourth.
3. It does NOT contain A or E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- I in position 3
- R somewhere except position 1
- S somewhere except position 4
- No A or E

Possible candidates:
- SIRKS (but has K, which we don't know about)
- RISKS (R in position 1 is invalid)
- SPIRS (but has P, which we don't know about)
- PRISM (P unknown, but M unknown)
- TRISK (T unknown, K unknown)

Let's try ""TRISK"":
- T is unknown, but let's see if it fits
- R is in position 2 (valid, since R can't be first)
- I is in position 3 (matches)
- S is in position 4 (but feedback says S is not in position 4 - conflict)
So TRISK is invalid.

Next try ""PRISM"":
- P unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- S in position 4 (invalid, same conflict)
Invalid.

Next try ""SPIRS"":
- S in position 1 (valid)
- P unknown
- I in position 2 (but we need I in position 3 - conflict)
Invalid.

Next try ""RISKS"":
- R in position 1 (invalid, R can't be first)
Invalid.

Next try ""CRISP"":
- C unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- S in position 4 (invalid, S can't be fourth)
Invalid.

Next try ""BRISK"":
- B unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- S in position 4 (invalid, S can't be fourth)
Invalid.

Next try ""DRIPS"":
- D unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- S in position 4 (invalid)
Invalid.

Next try ""GRIST"":
- G unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- S in position 4 (invalid)
Invalid.

Next try ""FRISK"":
- F unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- S in position 4 (invalid)
Invalid.

Next try ""WRIST"":
- W unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- S in position 4 (invalid)
Invalid.

Next try ""CRISP"" already tried.

Next try ""DRIPS"" already tried.

Next try ""BRISK"" already tried.

Next try ""PRISM"" already tried.

Next try ""TRISK"" already tried.

Next try ""SPIRS"" already tried.

Next try ""SPRIT"":
- S in position 1 (valid)
- P unknown
- R in position 2 (valid)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- T unknown
- S is not in position 4, so this is valid.

So ""SPRIT"" seems valid:
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- P unknown
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- T unknown

This seems like a good next guess to test new letters (P and T) while respecting the constraints.Based on the feedback:
- I is locked in position 3.
- R and S must appear somewhere, but R cannot be first and S cannot be fourth.
- A and E are eliminated.

A strong next guess is ""SPRIT"":
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- P and T are new letters to test
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- T is new

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPRIT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(-) R(-) I(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let me process the new feedback from SPRIT:

- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 1.
- P(-): P is in the word but not in position 2.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3.
- I(-): I is in the word but not in position 4.
- T(x): T is not in the word.

From the two guesses so far we know:

1. I must be in position 3 (from RAISE).
2. S must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from RAISE and SPRIT).
3. R must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from RAISE and SPRIT).
4. A, E, T are out.
5. P is in the word but cannot be in position 2.

So the word has:
- I in position 3
- S must be in position 2 or 5 (since it can't be 1 or 4)
- R must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (since it can't be 1 or 3)
- P must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is I, so 1, 4, or 5)

Let's consider possible placements:

Case 1: S in position 2
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: I
- R must be in position 4 or 5
- P must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but 4 or 5 might be taken by R)
  - If R is in 4, then P must be in 1 or 5
  - If R is in 5, then P must be in 1 or 4

Case 2: S in position 5
- Position 5: S
- Position 3: I
- R must be in position 2 or 4
- P must be in position 1, 2, 4 (but 2 or 4 might be taken by R)

Let's explore Case 1 first (S in 2, I in 3):
- Possible R positions: 4 or 5
  - R in 4: word is _ S I R _ 
    - P must be in 1 or 5
    - If P in 1: P S I R _ 
      - Need a 5th letter (not A, E, T, and not P, S, I, R)
      - Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
      - Need a valid 5-letter word: P S I R ? 
      - ""PSIR?"" doesn't seem valid. Maybe ""PSIRK"" but that's not common.
    - If P in 5: _ S I R P
      - Need a 1st letter: ? S I R P
      - ""QSIRP"" not valid. ""BSIRP"" not valid. ""DSIRP"" not valid. ""FSIRP"" not valid. ""GSIRP"" not valid. ""HSIRP"" not valid. ""JSIRP"" not valid. ""KSIRP"" not valid. ""LSIRP"" not valid. ""MSIRP"" not valid. ""NSIRP"" not valid. ""OSIRP"" not valid. ""QSIRP"" not valid. ""WSIRP"" not valid. ""YSIRP"" not valid. ""ZSIRP"" not valid. Doesn't seem possible.
  - R in 5: word is _ S I _ R
    - P must be in 1 or 4
    - If P in 1: P S I _ R
      - Need a 4th letter: ? S I ? R
      - ""PSI?R"" - possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
      - ""PSIKR"" not valid. ""PSILR"" not valid. ""PSIMR"" not valid. ""PSIONR"" too long. Doesn't seem possible.
    - If P in 4: _ S I P R
      - Need a 1st letter: ? S I P R
      - ""ASIPR"" not valid (A is out). ""BSIPR"" not valid. ""CSIPR"" not valid. ""DSIPR"" not valid. ""FSIPR"" not valid. ""GSIPR"" not valid. ""HSIPR"" not valid. ""JSIPR"" not valid. ""KSIPR"" not valid. ""LSIPR"" not valid. ""MSIPR"" not valid. ""NSIPR"" not valid. ""OSIPR"" not valid. ""QSIPR"" not valid. ""WSIPR"" not valid. ""YSIPR"" not valid. ""ZSIPR"" not valid. Doesn't seem possible.

Case 2: S in position 5
- Position 5: S
- Position 3: I
- R must be in position 2 or 4
  - R in 2: word is _ R I _ S
    - P must be in 1, 4 (since 3 is I, 2 is R, 5 is S)
    - If P in 1: P R I _ S
      - Need a 4th letter: ? R I ? S
      - ""PRI?S"" - possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
      - ""PRINS"" - but N is allowed. ""PRINS"" is a valid word (plural of prince, but 5 letters).
      - Check if PRINS is valid: Yes, ""PRINS"" is an accepted variant spelling in some dictionaries.
    - If P in 4: _ R I P S
      - Need a 1st letter: ? R I P S
      - ""ARIPS"" not valid (A out). ""BRIPS"" not valid. ""CRIPS"" is valid (plural of crimp). ""DRIPS"" is valid (but T is out). ""FRIPS"" not valid. ""GRIPS"" is valid. ""HRIPS"" not valid. ""KRIPS"" not valid. ""LRIPS"" not valid. ""MRIPS"" not valid. ""NRIPS"" not valid. ""PRIPS"" not valid. ""QRIPS"" not valid. ""WRIPS"" not valid. ""XRIPS"" not valid. ""YRIPS"" not valid. ""ZRIPS"" not valid. So possible words: CRIPS, GRIPS.
  - R in 4: word is _ _ I R S
    - P must be in 1 or 2 (since 3 is I, 4 is R, 5 is S)
    - If P in 1: P _ I R S
      - Need a 2nd letter: ? I R S
      - ""PI?RS"" - possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
      - ""PILRS"" not valid. ""PINGRS"" too long. Doesn't seem possible.
    - If P in 2: _ P I R S
      - Need a 1st letter: ? P I R S
      - ""APIRS"" not valid (A out). ""BPIRS"" not valid. ""CPIRS"" not valid. ""DPIRS"" not valid. ""FPIRS"" not valid. ""GPIRS"" not valid. ""HPIRS"" not valid. ""JPIRS"" not valid. ""KPIRS"" not valid. ""LPIRS"" not valid. ""MPIRS"" not valid. ""NPIRS"" not valid. ""OPIRS"" not valid. ""QPIRS"" not valid. ""WPIRS"" not valid. ""XPIRS"" not valid. ""YPIRS"" not valid. ""ZPIRS"" not valid. Doesn't seem possible.

So the most promising candidates are:
- PRINS (but might be obscure)
- CRIPS
- GRIPS

Between these, CRIPS and GRIPS are more common. Let's choose CRIPS first.Based on the feedback:
- I is locked in position 3.
- S must be in position 2 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).
- R must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 3).
- P must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3).
- A, E, T are eliminated.

A valid word fitting these constraints is **CRIPS**.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPRIT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(-) R(-) I(-) T(x)
Guess 3: CRIPS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CRIPS:

- C(x): C is not in the word.
- R(✓): R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- I(✓): I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- P(✓): P is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- S(✓): S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know the exact pattern:

Position 1: ?
Position 2: R
Position 3: I
Position 4: P
Position 5: S

We need a 5-letter word that matches the pattern _ R I P S.

Looking at the dictionary, the only common English word that fits this pattern is **BRIPS**, but that's not a valid word. The correct word is **PRIPS**, but that's also not valid. However, the only valid word is **CRIPS**, but C is already ruled out. 

Wait, let's think again. The pattern is _ R I P S. The valid word is **FRIPS**? No. Actually, the correct word is **DRIPS**, but D is allowed. Let me check:

- D is not used yet, so **DRIPS** fits the pattern D R I P S.

But let me confirm: D is allowed (not ruled out), R, I, P, S are all in the correct positions. So **DRIPS** is the word.

However, looking back at the feedback, T is already ruled out, but D hasn't been tested yet. 

But wait, let me think of other possibilities. The pattern is _ R I P S. The only valid English word that fits is **DRIPS**. 

But let me check if there are any others. **CRIPS** was already guessed, and C is out. **BRIPS** isn't valid. **FRIPS** isn't valid. **GRIPS** is G R I P S, which fits the pattern. 

So **GRIPS** is another valid word. Between **DRIPS** and **GRIPS**, both fit. 

But let me check the letters used so far. We know:
- A, E, T, C are out.
- R, I, P, S are in positions 2,3,4,5.

So possible first letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid words:
- **GRIPS** (G R I P S)
- **DRIPS** (D R I P S)

Both are valid, but **GRIPS** is more common. I'll go with **GRIPS**.

But wait, let me check if **GRIPS** is valid. Yes, **GRIPS** is a valid English word.

However, looking back at the feedback for CRIPS, P is in position 4 (✓), so P is correct. Similarly, R is in position 2 (✓), I in 3 (✓), S in 5 (✓). So the word must be _ R I P S.

The only valid words are **GRIPS** and **DRIPS**. I'll choose **GRIPS** as it's more common.

But let me think if there's any other. **FRIPS** isn't valid. **KRIPS** isn't valid. So the only two are **DRIPS** and **GRIPS**. 

I'll choose **GRIPS**.Based on the feedback from CRIPS, we now know the exact positions of R, I, P, and S. The word must be _ R I P S. The only common English word that fits this pattern is **GRIPS**.

Let\'s choose CRIPS first.Based on the feedback:\n- I is locked in position 3.\n- S must be in position 2 or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).\n- R must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 3).\n- P must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3).\n- A, E, T are eliminated.\n\nA valid word fitting these constraints is **CRIPS**.\n\n<guess>CRIPS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPRIT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(-) R(-) I(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: CRIPS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""From the new feedback on CRIPS:\n\n- C(x): C is not in the word.\n- R(✓): R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- I(✓): I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).\n- P(✓): P is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).\n- S(✓): S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).\n\nSo we now know the exact pattern:\n\nPosition 1: ?\nPosition 2: R\nPosition 3: I\nPosition 4: P\nPosition 5: S\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that matches the pattern _ R I P S.\n\nLooking at the dictionary, the only common English word that fits this pattern is **BRIPS**, but that's not a valid word. The correct word is **PRIPS**, but that's also not valid. However, the only valid word is **CRIPS**, but C is already ruled out. \n\nWait, let's think again. The pattern is _ R I P S. The valid word is **FRIPS**? No. Actually, the correct word is **DRIPS**, but D is allowed. Let me check:\n\n- D is not used yet, so **DRIPS** fits the pattern D R I P S.\n\nBut let me confirm: D is allowed (not ruled out), R, I, P, S are all in the correct positions. So **DRIPS** is the word.\n\nHowever, looking back at the feedback, T is already ruled out, but D hasn't been tested yet. \n\nBut wait, let me think of other possibilities. The pattern is _ R I P S. The only valid English word that fits is **DRIPS**. \n\nBut let me check if there are any others. **CRIPS** was already guessed, and C is out. **BRIPS** isn't valid. **FRIPS** isn't valid. **GRIPS** is G R I P S, which fits the pattern. \n\nSo **GRIPS** is another valid word. Between **DRIPS** and **GRIPS**, both fit. \n\nBut let me check the letters used so far. We know:\n- A, E, T, C are out.\n- R, I, P, S are in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\nSo possible first letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nValid words:\n- **GRIPS** (G R I P S)\n- **DRIPS** (D R I P S)\n\nBoth are valid, but **GRIPS** is more common. I'll go with **GRIPS**.\n\nBut wait, let me check if **GRIPS** is valid. Yes, **GRIPS** is a valid English word.\n\nHowever, looking back at the feedback for CRIPS, P is in position 4 (✓), so P is correct. Similarly, R is in position 2 (✓), I in 3 (✓), S in 5 (✓). So the word must be _ R I P S.\n\nThe only valid words are **GRIPS** and **DRIPS**. I'll choose **GRIPS** as it's more common.\n\nBut let me think if there's any other. **FRIPS** isn't valid. **KRIPS** isn't valid. So the only two are **DRIPS** and **GRIPS**. \n\nI'll choose **GRIPS**.Based on the feedback from CRIPS, we now know the exact positions of R, I, P, and S. The word must be _ R I P S.

From Guess 4 (GRIPS) we now know:

- G(x) → G is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is correctly placed at position 2.
- I(✓) → I is correctly placed at position 3.
- P(✓) → P is correctly placed at position 4.
- S(✓) → S is correctly placed at position 5.

So the pattern is: _ R I P S

Letters already ruled out for position 1: A, C, E, G, T  
Letters already confirmed in the word: R, I, P, S

Remaining possible first letters (from the alphabet excluding the ruled-out ones): B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The only common English 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ R I P S are:

- **BRIPS** – not a valid word.  
- **CRIPS** – C is already ruled out.  
- **DRIPS** – valid word.  
- **FRIPS** – not a valid word.  
- **GRIPS** – G is ruled out.  
- **KRIPS** – not a valid word.  
- **PRIPS** – not a valid word.  
- **WRIPS** – not a valid word.

Thus, the only remaining valid candidate is **DRIPS**.
