For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters in English words. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- Does contain S, but not in the first position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than the first position.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining vowels: I, O, U
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.

A strong second guess would be ""SHORN"":
- S is now in position 1 (but feedback said S is in the word but wrong position, so this is still valid since we just need to test another spot).
- H, O, R, N are all common letters not yet tested.
- This covers new vowels (O) and consonants (H, R, N).

Actually, since S was in position 1 and marked as wrong position, I should try S in another spot. Let me adjust: ""SHORN"" has S in position 1, which is the same as before. That’s not helpful. Instead, try ""CHURN"":
- C, H, U, R, N are all new letters.
- No L, A, T, E.
- S is not used here, but we already know S is in the word, so we can focus on other letters for now.

But we need to include S somewhere else. Let me choose ""SPURN"":
- S in position 1 again – same issue.

Better: ""DRIPS"":
- D, R, I, P, S.
- S in position 5.
- Uses new letters D, R, I, P.

This seems optimal.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, D, R, P  
- Letters that ARE in the word:  
  – S (and it is in the correct position: last letter)  
  – I (and it is in the word but NOT in position 3)

So the secret word ends in S and contains I somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).  
We need a 5-letter word ending in S, using I in one of the other positions, and avoiding all the eliminated letters.

Available consonants so far: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Available vowels: I (already known to be present), O, U (since A, E are out)

Let’s try to place I in position 2 and pick common remaining consonants for the other slots.  
A good candidate is “MISOS” – but O is allowed and we haven’t tested it yet.  
However, “MISOS” repeats O and S, which might not be optimal.  

Better: “CHICKS” – too long.  
“HICKS” – 5 letters, ends in S, has I in position 2, and uses new letters H, C, K.  
But “HICKS” isn’t a valid word.  

Valid word: “HICKS” doesn’t exist; “HITCH” ends in H, not S.  
Try “WICKS” – same issue.  

Let’s try I in position 4: “CUBIC” ends in C, not S.  
Try “WICKS” – invalid.  

Valid word with I in position 2 and ending in S: “CHIPS” – but P is eliminated.  
“MIXES” – E is eliminated.  
“GUIS” – too short.  

Valid word: “WISPS” – P is eliminated.  
“BIXIS” – not common.  

Valid word: “MIXED” – ends in D, eliminated.  

Let’s try I in position 1: “ICKIS” – invalid.  
“S” is already fixed at position 5.  

Valid word: “WISPS” – P eliminated.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters in English words. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- Does contain S, but not in the first position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than the first position.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining vowels: I, O, U
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.

A strong second guess would be ""SHORN"":
- S is now in position 1 (but feedback said S is in the word but wrong position, so this is still valid since we just need to test another spot).
- H, O, R, N are all common letters not yet tested.
- This covers new vowels (O) and consonants (H, R, N).

Actually, since S was in position 1 and marked as wrong position, I should try S in another spot. Let me adjust: ""SHORN"" has S in position 1, which is the same as before. That’s not helpful. Instead, try ""CHURN"":
- C, H, U, R, N are all new letters.
- No L, A, T, E.
- S is not used here, but we already know S is in the word, so we can focus on other letters for now.

But we need to include S somewhere else. Let me choose ""SPURN"":
- S in position 1 again – same issue.

Better: ""DRIPS"":
- D, R, I, P, S.
- S in position 5.
- Uses new letters D, R, I, P.

This seems optimal.

   - I is in the word but not in position 3.

So we know:
- The word ends with S.
- It contains I somewhere, but not in position 3.
- It does NOT contain: L, A, T, E, D, R, P.
- It still needs to use other common letters not yet tried.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A, E are out and I is confirmed).

Let’s try a word that:
- Ends with S.
- Contains I (but not in position 3).
- Uses new letters from the remaining pool.

A good candidate is ""WHISK"":
- W, H, I, K, S.
- Ends with S (✓).
- I is in position 3, but we know from DRIPS that I is not in position 3. So this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""MUSIC"":
- Ends with C, not S. Invalid.

Next: ""HUMPS"":
- Ends with S (✓).
- Contains U and M, P (but P is out). Invalid.

Next: ""CINCS"":
- Ends with S (✓).

But let’s verify:

- Ends with S (✓).
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not in position 3 from DRIPS).

So ""CINCS"" is a valid next guess.

However, ""CINCS"" might be considered less common. A better common word is ""CHINS"":
- C, H, I, N, S.
- Ends with S (✓).
- I is in position 3 – but from DRIPS, I is not in position 3. So this is invalid.

Next: ""MINIS"":

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters in English words. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- Does contain S, but not in the first position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than the first position.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining vowels: I, O, U
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.

A strong second guess would be ""SHORN"":
- S is now in position 1 (but feedback said S is in the word but wrong position, so this is still valid since we just need to test another spot).
- H, O, R, N are all common letters not yet tested.
- This covers new vowels (O) and consonants (H, R, N).

Actually, since S was in position 1 and marked as wrong position, I should try S in another spot. Let me adjust: ""SHORN"" has S in position 1, which is the same as before. That’s not helpful. Instead, try ""CHURN"":

Current knowledge:

So the word has I in position 4 and also somewhere else (position 1 or 3), but position 3 is excluded by DRIPS, so I must be in position 1. But position 4 is already I, which would make two I's. This seems possible.

But let me check again:
- DRIPS: I(-) means I is in the word but not in position 3.
- MINIS: first I(-) means first I is not in position 2, and second I(✓) means it is in position 4.
So the word has I in position 4 and also somewhere else (positions 1 or 2). But position 2 is excluded by MINIS first I(-), so I must be in position 1. So positions 1 and 4 are I, and position 5 is S.

So the word is I _ _ I S.

Now we need to find letters for positions 2 and 3, using remaining allowed letters (not L, A, T, E, D, R, P, M, and not repeating I or S).

Remaining common letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, N, V, W, Y, etc.

From MINIS: N is in the word but not in position 3. So N must be in position 2.

So the word is I N _ I S. The missing letter is position 3, which must be from remaining allowed letters (not excluded).

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in ""INIS"":
- ""INVIS"" (but V is allowed)
- ""INVIS"" is a valid word.

Let's check:
- I N V I S
- Letters: I, N, V, I, S
- V is not excluded.

- Contains I in positions 1 and 4 (positions 1 and 4 are allowed based on feedback)
- No excluded letters.

So the guess is ""INVIS"".

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters in English words. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- Does contain S, but not in the first position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than the first position.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining vowels: I, O, U
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.

A strong second guess would be ""SHORN"":
- S is now in position 1 (but feedback said S is in the word but wrong position, so this is still valid since we just need to test another spot).
- H, O, R, N are all common letters not yet tested.
- This covers new vowels (O) and consonants (H, R, N).

Actually, since S was in position 1 and marked as wrong position, I should try S in another spot. Let me adjust: ""SHORN"" has S in position 1, which is the same as before. That’s not helpful. Instead, try ""CHURN"":
- C, H, U, R, N are all new letters.
- No L, A, T, E.
- S is not used here, but we already know S is in the word, so we can focus on other letters for now.

But we need to include S somewhere else. Let me choose ""SPURN"":
- S in position 1 again – same issue.

Better: ""DRIPS"":
- D, R, I, P, S.
- S in position 5.
- Uses new letters D, R, I, P.

This seems optimal.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

2. DRIPS → D(x) R(x) I(-) P(x) S(✓)
   - D, R, P are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is now confirmed in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends with S.
- It contains I somewhere, but not in position 3.
- It does NOT contain: L, A, T, E, D, R, P.
- It still needs to use other common letters not yet tried.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A, E are out and I is confirmed).

Let’s try a word that:
- Ends with S.
- Contains I (but not in position 3).
- Uses new letters from the remaining pool.

A good candidate is ""WHISK"":
- W, H, I, K, S.
- Ends with S (✓).
- I is in position 3, but we know from DRIPS that I is not in position 3. So this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""MUSIC"":
- Ends with C, not S. Invalid.

Next: ""HUMPS"":
- Ends with S (✓).
- Contains U and M, P (but P is out). Invalid.

Next: ""CINCS"":
- Ends with S (✓).
- Contains I (position 2), which is allowed.
- Letters: C, I, N, C, S.
- C and N are new, but ""CINCS"" is a valid word.

This seems acceptable.

But let’s verify:
- C, I, N, S are all allowed (not in the excluded list).
- Ends with S (✓).
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not in position 3 from DRIPS).

So ""CINCS"" is a valid next guess.

However, ""CINCS"" might be considered less common. A better common word is ""CHINS"":
- C, H, I, N, S.
- Ends with S (✓).
- I is in position 3 – but from DRIPS, I is not in position 3. So this is invalid.

Next: ""MINIS"":
- Ends with S (✓).
- I is in positions 2 and 4 (allowed).
- Letters: M, I, N, I, S.
- All letters allowed.

This is valid.

Between ""CINCS"" and ""MINIS"", ""MINIS"" is more common.

So I’ll go with ""MINIS"".

Let's update what we know after the fifth guess.

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. DRIPS → D(x) R(x) I(-) P(x) S(✓)
   - D, R, P are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is confirmed in position 5.

3. MINIS → M(x) I(-) N(-) I(✓) S(✓)
   - M is not in the word.
   - First I is not in position 2.
   - N is in the word but not in position 3.
   - Second I is confirmed in position 4.
   - S is confirmed in position 5.

4. INVIS → I(-) N(-) V(x) I(✓) S(✓)
   - I is not in position 1 (first I is -).
   - N is not in position 2 (second N is -).
   - V is not in the word.
   - I is confirmed in position 4.
   - S is confirmed in position 5.

Combining all constraints:
- Word ends with ""IS"" (positions 4 and 5 are I and S).
- I must appear exactly once (since we have only one I in the word confirmed by the feedback).
- Therefore, the word has I in position 4 and S in position 5, with no other I.
- From DRIPS, I is in the word but not in position 3 (but position 3 is now irrelevant since I is only in position 4).
- From MINIS, N is in the word but not in position 3.
- From INVIS, N is in the word but not in position 2.
- Therefore, N must be in position 1 or 3.
- From SLATE, L is not in the word.
- From all guesses, excluded letters: L, A, T, E, D, R, P, M, V.
- Remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, N, U, W, Y, etc.

Possible structures:
- N _ _ I S (N in position 1)
- _ N _ I S (N in position 3)

Let's check both:
1. N _ _ I S:
   - N is allowed in position 1.
   - Need two more letters from remaining pool (not excluded).
   - Common letters left: B, C, F, G, H, K, U, W, Y.
   - Possible words: NUBIS, NUCIS (invalid), NEXIS (E excluded), etc.
   - ""NUBIS"" is a valid word.

2. _ N _ I S:
   - N is allowed in position 3.
   - First letter must be from remaining pool.
   - Possible words: B N _ I S → ""B N _ I S"" → ""B N E I S"" (E excluded), ""B N U I S"" → ""BNUIS"" invalid, ""C N _ I S"" → ""C N U I S"" → ""CNUIS"" invalid, ""H N _ I S"" → ""HNUIS"" invalid, etc. None seem valid.

Therefore, the only plausible word is N _ _ I S with N in position 1. The missing letters must be from remaining pool. A common word is ""NUBIS"".

Let's verify:
- N U B I S
- Ends with ""IS"" (positions 4-5: I S) ✓
- N is in position 1 (allowed) ✓
- No excluded letters (L, A, T, E, D, R, P, M, V are all absent) ✓
- All letters are valid (N, U, B, I, S) ✓
