For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these.

Looking at combinations, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- Three very common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This gives us maximum coverage of high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong contender would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of S, which is extremely common. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

The feedback from AROSE tells me:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So I need a word that:
1. Contains the letter A (but not in the 1st position).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Looking at remaining common letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, Y, etc.

I want a word that has A in positions 2-5 and uses other frequent letters. Good candidates:
- A is in position 2: T A _ _ _ (e.g., TAPIR - but has R, which is excluded)
- A is in position 3: _ _ A _ _ (e.g., PLAIN - but has I and N, which are fine)
- A is in position 4: _ _ _ A _ (e.g., CHALK - but has K, which is less common)
- A is in position 5: _ _ _ _ A (e.g., MOUNT - but has O, which is excluded)

Best options seem to be words like PLAIN, GLAND, CHALK, etc. Among these, PLAIN uses very common letters (P, L, I, N) and keeps A in position 3. This should give good information about remaining consonants and vowels.

Let me check:
- PLAIN: P, L, A, I, N
- Contains A (in position 3)
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E
- Uses very common letters (P, L, I, N)

This seems optimal.

Current constraints:

3. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, L, I, N.

Since A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, the only remaining positions for A are 2 or 5.
- Position 2: P A _ _ _
- Position 5: P _ _ _ A

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with P and containing A in position 2 or 5, avoiding all excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- PAINT – but contains I and N (both excluded)
- PACTS – contains C, T, S (S excluded)
- PAGOD – contains G, O, D (O excluded)
- PANDA – contains N, D (N excluded)
- PAPAW – contains P, A, W (but P already known in first position, and A repeated)
- PAVLO – contains V, L, O (L, O excluded)
- PACHY – contains C, H, Y (but A in position 2)
- PADDY – contains D, D, Y (but A in position 2)

Actually, let's list valid options systematically:
- A must be in position 2 or 5.
- Must start with P.
- Must avoid R, O, S, E, L, I, N.

For A in position 2: P A _ _ _
Possible letters for positions 3-5 (from remaining): T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.
Looking for common words:
- PACTS – but S excluded
- PADDY – D, D, Y (valid)
- PAGOD – O excluded
- PAVLO – L, O excluded
- PACHY – C, H, Y (valid)

For A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible letters for positions 2-4: T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.
Looking for common words:
- PUDGY – U, D, G, Y (valid)
- PUMPA – M, P (but P already in position 1, and A in position 5)
- PUGGY – U, G, G, Y (valid)
- PUPPY – U, P, P (but P already in position 1, and A missing)

Best valid candidates:
- PADDY (P A D D Y)
- PACHY (P A C H Y)
- PUDGY (P U D G Y)
- PUGGY (P U G G Y)

Among these, PUDGY and PUGGY are common words. PUDGY uses U, D, G, Y which are all allowed. PUGGY uses U, G, G, Y which is also allowed.

Choosing PUDGY as it's a common word and tests new letters U, D, G, Y.

But wait, let's verify:
PUDGY: P, U, D, G, Y
- P is confirmed in position 1 (✓)
- A is not in this word, but we know A must be in position 2 or 5. This word doesn't have A, which violates the constraint. My mistake!

Re-evaluating:
We must include A in position 2 or 5.

For A in position 2: P A _ _ _
Possible words:
- PADDY (P A D D Y) – but D is repeated, and Y is allowed
- PACHY (P A C H Y)
- PAGGY (P A G G Y)

For A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible words:
- PUDMA – but M, U, D (valid letters)
- PUGMA – G, U, M (valid letters)
- PUDMA, PUGMA are less common.

Best options:
- PADDY (P A D D Y)
- PACHY (P A C H Y)
- PAGGY (P A G G Y)

PADDY seems most common.

But let's check if any of these have excluded letters:
- P, A, D, D, Y – all allowed
- P, A, C, H, Y – all allowed
- P, A, G, G, Y – all allowed

PADDY is a valid choice.

However, PADDY has A in position 2, which is allowed (A cannot be in positions 1,3,4).

Thus, the next guess should be PADDY.

But wait, let's see if there's a better word. PACHY is also valid.

Actually, looking at common words, PACHY is not as common as PADDY. PADDY seems better.

But another thought: PUDMA and PUGMA are not common words. PUDGY doesn't have A. So the best valid options are PADDY, PACHY, PAGGY.

Among these, PAGGY is a valid word (though less common), but PADDY is more common.

However, let's check if there's a word with A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible: PUDMA, PUGMA, PUMPA (but M, P, P, A – P already in position 1, and A in 5, but PUMPA has P in 3 which is invalid because P is only confirmed in position 1). So PUMPA is invalid.

Thus, the best valid options are PADDY, PACHY, PAGGY.

PADDY seems the most common.

But let me think if there's a better word. Actually, PUDMA is not a valid word. PUGMA is not valid either.

Another candidate: PACED – but E is excluded.

PAVUK – U, K – but V is allowed, but word is obscure.

Thus, the best valid common word seems PADDY.

But wait, let me check if PADDY is valid: yes, it's a word (a type of rice).

However, another thought: PACHY is a valid word (relating to the back of a horse).

But PADDY is more common.

Actually, let me think of another approach: since A must be in position 2 or 5, and we have P fixed in position 1, let's list possible words:

Position 1: P
Position 2: A
Positions 3-5: from remaining letters (T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.)

Possible combinations:
- P A T _ _ : PATSY – but S excluded
- P A C _ _ : PACED – E excluded, PACED is 5 letters but E excluded
- P A C H Y – PACHY (valid)
- P A D D Y – PADDY (valid)
- P A G G Y – PAGGY (valid)

Similarly for A in position 5:
P _ _ _ A
- P U D G A – but G, A – but word is PUDGA (not common)
- P U G G A – PUGGA (not common)
- P U D M A – PUDMA (not common)
- P U M P A – PUMPA (but P already in 1, and P in 3 is invalid)
- P U C H A – PUCHA (not common)

Thus, the only valid common words are PACHY, PADDY, PAGGY.

Among these, PADDY seems the most common.

But let me check if there's a better word. Actually, PUDMA is not valid. PUGMA is not valid.

Thus, the best valid common word is PADDY.

However, another candidate: PACED is invalid (E excluded). PACED is 5 letters but E is excluded.

Thus, the best valid common word seems PADDY.

But wait, let me think if there's a word with A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible: PUDMA, PUGMA, PUMPA, PUCHA, etc. None seem common.

Thus, the best valid common word is PACHY or PADDY.

Between PACHY and PADDY, PADDY is more common.

Thus, the next guess should be PADDY.

But let me verify:
PADDY:
- P in position 1 (✓)
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A cannot be in 1,3,4)
- D, D, Y – none of these are excluded letters
This satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is PADDY.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- P is confirmed in the first position (✓).
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from AROSE and PLAIN feedback).
- Letters R, O, S, E, L, I, N are excluded.

A must therefore be in position 2 or 5. The most common word that fits these constraints is:

<guess>PADDY</guess>",PADDY,"Current constraints:
1. P is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
2. A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from AROSE and PLAIN feedback).
3. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, L, I, N.
4. Remaining common letters: T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.

Since A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, the only remaining positions for A are 2 or 5.
- Position 2: P A _ _ _
- Position 5: P _ _ _ A

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with P and containing A in position 2 or 5, avoiding all excluded letters.

Possible candidates:

- PACTS – contains C, T, S (S excluded)
- PAGOD – contains G, O, D (O excluded)
- PANDA – contains N, D (N excluded)
- PAPAW – contains P, A, W (but P already known in first position, and A repeated)
- PAVLO – contains V, L, O (L, O excluded)
- PACHY – contains C, H, Y (but A in position 2)
- PADDY – contains D, D, Y (but A in position 2)

Actually, let's list valid options systematically:
- A must be in position 2 or 5.
- Must start with P.
- Must avoid R, O, S, E, L, I, N.

For A in position 2: P A _ _ _
Possible letters for positions 3-5 (from remaining): T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.
Looking for common words:
- PACTS – but S excluded
- PADDY – D, D, Y (valid)
- PAGOD – O excluded
- PAVLO – L, O excluded
- PACHY – C, H, Y (valid)

For A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible letters for positions 2-4: T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.
Looking for common words:
- PUDGY – U, D, G, Y (valid)
- PUMPA – M, P (but P already in position 1, and A in position 5)
- PUGGY – U, G, G, Y (valid)
- PUPPY – U, P, P (but P already in position 1, and A missing)

Best valid candidates:
- PADDY (P A D D Y)
- PACHY (P A C H Y)
- PUDGY (P U D G Y)
- PUGGY (P U G G Y)

Among these, PUDGY and PUGGY are common words. PUDGY uses U, D, G, Y which are all allowed. PUGGY uses U, G, G, Y which is also allowed.

Choosing PUDGY as it's a common word and tests new letters U, D, G, Y.

But wait, let's verify:
PUDGY: P, U, D, G, Y
- P is confirmed in position 1 (✓)
- A is not in this word, but we know A must be in position 2 or 5. This word doesn't have A, which violates the constraint. My mistake!

Re-evaluating:
We must include A in position 2 or 5.

For A in position 2: P A _ _ _
Possible words:
- PADDY (P A D D Y) – but D is repeated, and Y is allowed
- PACHY (P A C H Y)
- PAGGY (P A G G Y)

For A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible words:
- PUDMA – but M, U, D (valid letters)
- PUGMA – G, U, M (valid letters)
- PUDMA, PUGMA are less common.

Best options:
- PADDY (P A D D Y)
- PACHY (P A C H Y)
- PAGGY (P A G G Y)

PADDY seems most common.

But let's check if any of these have excluded letters:
- P, A, D, D, Y – all allowed
- P, A, C, H, Y – all allowed
- P, A, G, G, Y – all allowed

PADDY is a valid choice.

However, PADDY has A in position 2, which is allowed (A cannot be in positions 1,3,4).

Thus, the next guess should be PADDY.

But wait, let's see if there's a better word. PACHY is also valid.

Actually, looking at common words, PACHY is not as common as PADDY. PADDY seems better.

But another thought: PUDMA and PUGMA are not common words. PUDGY doesn't have A. So the best valid options are PADDY, PACHY, PAGGY.

Among these, PAGGY is a valid word (though less common), but PADDY is more common.

However, let's check if there's a word with A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible: PUDMA, PUGMA, PUMPA (but M, P, P, A – P already in position 1, and A in 5, but PUMPA has P in 3 which is invalid because P is only confirmed in position 1). So PUMPA is invalid.

Thus, the best valid options are PADDY, PACHY, PAGGY.

PADDY seems the most common.

But let me think if there's a better word. Actually, PUDMA is not a valid word. PUGMA is not valid either.

Another candidate: PACED – but E is excluded.

PAVUK – U, K – but V is allowed, but word is obscure.

Thus, the best valid common word seems PADDY.

But wait, let me check if PADDY is valid: yes, it's a word (a type of rice).

However, another thought: PACHY is a valid word (relating to the back of a horse).

But PADDY is more common.

Actually, let me think of another approach: since A must be in position 2 or 5, and we have P fixed in position 1, let's list possible words:

Position 1: P
Position 2: A
Positions 3-5: from remaining letters (T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.)

Possible combinations:
- P A T _ _ : PATSY – but S excluded
- P A C _ _ : PACED – E excluded, PACED is 5 letters but E excluded
- P A C H Y – PACHY (valid)
- P A D D Y – PADDY (valid)
- P A G G Y – PAGGY (valid)

Similarly for A in position 5:
P _ _ _ A
- P U D G A – but G, A – but word is PUDGA (not common)
- P U G G A – PUGGA (not common)
- P U D M A – PUDMA (not common)
- P U M P A – PUMPA (but P already in 1, and P in 3 is invalid)
- P U C H A – PUCHA (not common)

Thus, the only valid common words are PACHY, PADDY, PAGGY.

Among these, PADDY seems the most common.

But let me check if there's a better word. Actually, PUDMA is not valid. PUGMA is not valid.

Thus, the best valid common word is PADDY.

However, another candidate: PACED is invalid (E excluded). PACED is 5 letters but E is excluded.

Thus, the best valid common word seems PADDY.

But wait, let me think if there's a word with A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible: PUDMA, PUGMA, PUMPA, PUCHA, etc. None seem common.

Thus, the best valid common word is PACHY or PADDY.

Between PACHY and PADDY, PADDY is more common.

Thus, the next guess should be PADDY.

But let me verify:
PADDY:
- P in position 1 (✓)
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A cannot be in 1,3,4)
- D, D, Y – none of these are excluded letters
This satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is PADDY.Based on the feedback:
- P is confirmed in the first position (✓).
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from AROSE and PLAIN feedback).
- Letters R, O, S, E, L, I, N are excluded.

A must therefore be in position 2 or 5. The most common word that fits these constraints is:",Guess 3: PADDY -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) D(-) D(-) Y(x),FAIL

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these.

Looking at combinations, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- Three very common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This gives us maximum coverage of high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong contender would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of S, which is extremely common. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from AROSE tells me:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So I need a word that:
1. Contains the letter A (but not in the 1st position).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Looking at remaining common letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, Y, etc.

I want a word that has A in positions 2-5 and uses other frequent letters. Good candidates:
- A is in position 2: T A _ _ _ (e.g., TAPIR - but has R, which is excluded)
- A is in position 3: _ _ A _ _ (e.g., PLAIN - but has I and N, which are fine)
- A is in position 4: _ _ _ A _ (e.g., CHALK - but has K, which is less common)
- A is in position 5: _ _ _ _ A (e.g., MOUNT - but has O, which is excluded)

Best options seem to be words like PLAIN, GLAND, CHALK, etc. Among these, PLAIN uses very common letters (P, L, I, N) and keeps A in position 3. This should give good information about remaining consonants and vowels.

Let me check:
- PLAIN: P, L, A, I, N
- Contains A (in position 3)
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E
- Uses very common letters (P, L, I, N)

This seems optimal.

Current constraints:

3. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, L, I, N.
4. Remaining common letters: T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.

Since A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, the only remaining positions for A are 2 or 5.
- Position 2: P A _ _ _
- Position 5: P _ _ _ A

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with P and containing A in position 2 or 5, avoiding all excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- PAINT – but contains I and N (both excluded)
- PACTS – contains C, T, S (S excluded)
- PAGOD – contains G, O, D (O excluded)
- PANDA – contains N, D (N excluded)

- PAVLO – contains V, L, O (L, O excluded)
- PACHY – contains C, H, Y (but A in position 2)

Actually, let's list valid options systematically:
- A must be in position 2 or 5.
- Must start with P.
- Must avoid R, O, S, E, L, I, N.

For A in position 2: P A _ _ _
Possible letters for positions 3-5 (from remaining): T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.
Looking for common words:

For A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible letters for positions 2-4: T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.
Looking for common words:

- PUMPA – M, P (but P already in position 1, and A in position 5)
- PUGGY – U, G, G, Y (valid)
- PUPPY – U, P, P (but P already in position 1, and A missing)

Best valid candidates:
- PADDY (P A D D Y)
- PACHY (P A C H Y)
- PUDGY (P U D G Y)
- PUGGY (P U G G Y)

Among these, PUDGY and PUGGY are common words. PUDGY uses U, D, G, Y which are all allowed. PUGGY uses U, G, G, Y which is also allowed.

Choosing PUDGY as it's a common word and tests new letters U, D, G, Y.

But wait, let's verify:
PUDGY: P, U, D, G, Y
- P is confirmed in position 1 (✓)
- A is not in this word, but we know A must be in position 2 or 5. This word doesn't have A, which violates the constraint. My mistake!

Re-evaluating:
We must include A in position 2 or 5.

For A in position 2: P A _ _ _
Possible words:
- PADDY (P A D D Y) – but D is repeated, and Y is allowed
- PACHY (P A C H Y)
- PAGGY (P A G G Y)

For A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible words:
- PUDMA – but M, U, D (valid letters)
- PUGMA – G, U, M (valid letters)
- PUDMA, PUGMA are less common.

Best options:
- PADDY (P A D D Y)
- PACHY (P A C H Y)
- PAGGY (P A G G Y)

PADDY seems most common.

But let's check if any of these have excluded letters:
- P, A, D, D, Y – all allowed
- P, A, C, H, Y – all allowed
- P, A, G, G, Y – all allowed

PADDY is a valid choice.

However, PADDY has A in position 2, which is allowed (A cannot be in positions 1,3,4).

Thus, the next guess should be PADDY.

But wait, let's see if there's a better word. PACHY is also valid.

Actually, looking at common words, PACHY is not as common as PADDY. PADDY seems better.

But another thought: PUDMA and PUGMA are not common words. PUDGY doesn't have A. So the best valid options are PADDY, PACHY, PAGGY.

Among these, PAGGY is a valid word (though less common), but PADDY is more common.

However, let's check if there's a word with A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible: PUDMA, PUGMA, PUMPA (but M, P, P, A – P already in position 1, and A in 5, but PUMPA has P in 3 which is invalid because P is only confirmed in position 1). So PUMPA is invalid.

Thus, the best valid options are PADDY, PACHY, PAGGY.

PADDY seems the most common.

But let me think if there's a better word. Actually, PUDMA is not a valid word. PUGMA is not valid either.

Another candidate: PACED – but E is excluded.

PAVUK – U, K – but V is allowed, but word is obscure.

- P A C _ _ : PACED – E excluded, PACED is 5 letters but E excluded
- P A C H Y – PACHY (valid)
- P A D D Y – PADDY (valid)
- P A G G Y – PAGGY (valid)

Similarly for A in position 5:
P _ _ _ A
- P U D G A – but G, A – but word is PUDGA (not common)
- P U G G A – PUGGA (not common)
- P U D M A – PUDMA (not common)

Thus, the only valid common words are PACHY, PADDY, PAGGY.

Among these, PADDY seems the most common.

But let me check if there's a better word. Actually, PUDMA is not valid. PUGMA is not valid.

Thus, the best valid common word is PADDY.

However, another candidate: PACED is invalid (E excluded). PACED is 5 letters but E is excluded.

Thus, the best valid common word seems PADDY.

But wait, let me think if there's a word with A in position 5: P _ _ _ A

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these.

Looking at combinations, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- Three very common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This gives us maximum coverage of high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong contender would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of S, which is extremely common. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from AROSE tells me:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So I need a word that:
1. Contains the letter A (but not in the 1st position).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Looking at remaining common letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, Y, etc.

I want a word that has A in positions 2-5 and uses other frequent letters. Good candidates:
- A is in position 2: T A _ _ _ (e.g., TAPIR - but has R, which is excluded)
- A is in position 3: _ _ A _ _ (e.g., PLAIN - but has I and N, which are fine)
- A is in position 4: _ _ _ A _ (e.g., CHALK - but has K, which is less common)
- A is in position 5: _ _ _ _ A (e.g., MOUNT - but has O, which is excluded)

Best options seem to be words like PLAIN, GLAND, CHALK, etc. Among these, PLAIN uses very common letters (P, L, I, N) and keeps A in position 3. This should give good information about remaining consonants and vowels.

Let me check:
- PLAIN: P, L, A, I, N
- Contains A (in position 3)
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E
- Uses very common letters (P, L, I, N)

This seems optimal.

3. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, L, I, N.
4. Remaining common letters: T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.

Since A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, the only remaining positions for A are 2 or 5.
- Position 2: P A _ _ _
- Position 5: P _ _ _ A

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with P and containing A in position 2 or 5, avoiding all excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- PAINT – but contains I and N (both excluded)
- PACTS – contains C, T, S (S excluded)
- PAGOD – contains G, O, D (O excluded)
- PANDA – contains N, D (N excluded)
- PAPAW – contains P, A, W (but P already known in first position, and A repeated)
- PAVLO – contains V, L, O (L, O excluded)
- PACHY – contains C, H, Y (but A in position 2)
- PADDY – contains D, D, Y (but A in position 2)

Actually, let's list valid options systematically:
- A must be in position 2 or 5.
- Must start with P.
- Must avoid R, O, S, E, L, I, N.

For A in position 2: P A _ _ _
Possible letters for positions 3-5 (from remaining): T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.
Looking for common words:
- PACTS – but S excluded
- PADDY – D, D, Y (valid)
- PAGOD – O excluded
- PAVLO – L, O excluded
- PACHY – C, H, Y (valid)

For A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible letters for positions 2-4: T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.
Looking for common words:
- PUDGY – U, D, G, Y (valid)
- PUMPA – M, P (but P already in position 1, and A in position 5)
- PUGGY – U, G, G, Y (valid)
- PUPPY – U, P, P (but P already in position 1, and A missing)

Best valid candidates:
- PADDY (P A D D Y)
- PACHY (P A C H Y)
- PUDGY (P U D G Y)
- PUGGY (P U G G Y)

Among these, PUDGY and PUGGY are common words. PUDGY uses U, D, G, Y which are all allowed. PUGGY uses U, G, G, Y which is also allowed.

Choosing PUDGY as it's a common word and tests new letters U, D, G, Y.

But wait, let's verify:
PUDGY: P, U, D, G, Y
- P is confirmed in position 1 (✓)
- A is not in this word, but we know A must be in position 2 or 5. This word doesn't have A, which violates the constraint. My mistake!

Re-evaluating:
We must include A in position 2 or 5.

For A in position 2: P A _ _ _
Possible words:
- PADDY (P A D D Y) – but D is repeated, and Y is allowed
- PACHY (P A C H Y)
- PAGGY (P A G G Y)

For A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible words:
- PUDMA – but M, U, D (valid letters)
- PUGMA – G, U, M (valid letters)
- PUDMA, PUGMA are less common.

Best options:
- PADDY (P A D D Y)
- PACHY (P A C H Y)
- PAGGY (P A G G Y)

PADDY seems most common.

But let's check if any of these have excluded letters:
- P, A, D, D, Y – all allowed
- P, A, C, H, Y – all allowed
- P, A, G, G, Y – all allowed

PADDY is a valid choice.

However, PADDY has A in position 2, which is allowed (A cannot be in positions 1,3,4).

Thus, the next guess should be PADDY.

But wait, let's see if there's a better word. PACHY is also valid.

Actually, looking at common words, PACHY is not as common as PADDY. PADDY seems better.

But another thought: PUDMA and PUGMA are not common words. PUDGY doesn't have A. So the best valid options are PADDY, PACHY, PAGGY.

Among these, PAGGY is a valid word (though less common), but PADDY is more common.

However, let's check if there's a word with A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible: PUDMA, PUGMA, PUMPA (but M, P, P, A – P already in position 1, and A in 5, but PUMPA has P in 3 which is invalid because P is only confirmed in position 1). So PUMPA is invalid.

Thus, the best valid options are PADDY, PACHY, PAGGY.

PADDY seems the most common.

But let me think if there's a better word. Actually, PUDMA is not a valid word. PUGMA is not valid either.

Another candidate: PACED – but E is excluded.

PAVUK – U, K – but V is allowed, but word is obscure.

Thus, the best valid common word seems PADDY.

But wait, let me check if PADDY is valid: yes, it's a word (a type of rice).

However, another thought: PACHY is a valid word (relating to the back of a horse).

But PADDY is more common.

Actually, let me think of another approach: since A must be in position 2 or 5, and we have P fixed in position 1, let's list possible words:

Position 1: P
Position 2: A
Positions 3-5: from remaining letters (T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.)

Possible combinations:
- P A T _ _ : PATSY – but S excluded
- P A C _ _ : PACED – E excluded, PACED is 5 letters but E excluded
- P A C H Y – PACHY (valid)
- P A D D Y – PADDY (valid)
- P A G G Y – PAGGY (valid)

Similarly for A in position 5:
P _ _ _ A
- P U D G A – but G, A – but word is PUDGA (not common)
- P U G G A – PUGGA (not common)
- P U D M A – PUDMA (not common)
- P U M P A – PUMPA (but P already in 1, and P in 3 is invalid)
- P U C H A – PUCHA (not common)

Thus, the only valid common words are PACHY, PADDY, PAGGY.

Among these, PADDY seems the most common.

But let me check if there's a better word. Actually, PUDMA is not valid. PUGMA is not valid.

Thus, the best valid common word is PADDY.

However, another candidate: PACED is invalid (E excluded). PACED is 5 letters but E is excluded.

Thus, the best valid common word seems PADDY.

But wait, let me think if there's a word with A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible: PUDMA, PUGMA, PUMPA, PUCHA, etc. None seem common.

Thus, the best valid common word is PACHY or PADDY.

Between PACHY and PADDY, PADDY is more common.

Thus, the next guess should be PADDY.

But let me verify:
PADDY:
- P in position 1 (✓)
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A cannot be in 1,3,4)
- D, D, Y – none of these are excluded letters
This satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is PADDY.Based on the feedback:
- P is confirmed in the first position (✓).
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from AROSE and PLAIN feedback).
- Letters R, O, S, E, L, I, N are excluded.

A must therefore be in position 2 or 5. The most common word that fits these constraints is:

4. Y is not in the word (Y(x)).
5. Excluded letters so far: R, O, S, E, L, I, N, Y.
6. Remaining common letters: T, U, C, M, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.

So the word looks like: P A _ _ _

We need two more letters, with D somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (but not both, since both were marked D(-) in PADDY). However, since both D's in PADDY were marked (-), D must appear exactly once in the word, and it must be in position 3 or 4.

- P A D D Y – but Y is excluded.
- P A D K A – A is already in position 2, and A is allowed in position 5?

- C, H are new letters to test.
- A in position 5 is allowed (A can be in 2 or 5).
- No excluded letters (R, O, S, E, L, I, N, Y are all absent).

This seems to fit all constraints.

Another possible word: P A C K A – but PACKA is not standard.
P A M B A – not a word.
P A T H A – PATHA is a word (a type of musical note in some contexts), but H is allowed.

Comparing PACHA and PATHA, both are valid, but PACHA is more common in English word lists.

- P A _ D _ : P A C H A (valid), P A M D A (invalid), P A T H A (valid).

Between P A C H A and P A T H A, P A C H A is more common. Therefore, the next guess is PACHA.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these.

Looking at combinations, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- Three very common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This gives us maximum coverage of high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong contender would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of S, which is extremely common. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from AROSE tells me:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So I need a word that:
1. Contains the letter A (but not in the 1st position).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Looking at remaining common letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, Y, etc.

I want a word that has A in positions 2-5 and uses other frequent letters. Good candidates:
- A is in position 2: T A _ _ _ (e.g., TAPIR - but has R, which is excluded)
- A is in position 3: _ _ A _ _ (e.g., PLAIN - but has I and N, which are fine)
- A is in position 4: _ _ _ A _ (e.g., CHALK - but has K, which is less common)
- A is in position 5: _ _ _ _ A (e.g., MOUNT - but has O, which is excluded)

Best options seem to be words like PLAIN, GLAND, CHALK, etc. Among these, PLAIN uses very common letters (P, L, I, N) and keeps A in position 3. This should give good information about remaining consonants and vowels.

Let me check:
- PLAIN: P, L, A, I, N
- Contains A (in position 3)
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E
- Uses very common letters (P, L, I, N)

This seems optimal.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLAIN -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) L(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints:
1. P is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
2. A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from AROSE and PLAIN feedback).
3. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, L, I, N.
4. Remaining common letters: T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.

Since A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, the only remaining positions for A are 2 or 5.
- Position 2: P A _ _ _
- Position 5: P _ _ _ A

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with P and containing A in position 2 or 5, avoiding all excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- PAINT – but contains I and N (both excluded)
- PACTS – contains C, T, S (S excluded)
- PAGOD – contains G, O, D (O excluded)
- PANDA – contains N, D (N excluded)
- PAPAW – contains P, A, W (but P already known in first position, and A repeated)
- PAVLO – contains V, L, O (L, O excluded)
- PACHY – contains C, H, Y (but A in position 2)
- PADDY – contains D, D, Y (but A in position 2)

Actually, let's list valid options systematically:
- A must be in position 2 or 5.
- Must start with P.
- Must avoid R, O, S, E, L, I, N.

For A in position 2: P A _ _ _
Possible letters for positions 3-5 (from remaining): T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.
Looking for common words:
- PACTS – but S excluded
- PADDY – D, D, Y (valid)
- PAGOD – O excluded
- PAVLO – L, O excluded
- PACHY – C, H, Y (valid)

For A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible letters for positions 2-4: T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.
Looking for common words:
- PUDGY – U, D, G, Y (valid)
- PUMPA – M, P (but P already in position 1, and A in position 5)
- PUGGY – U, G, G, Y (valid)
- PUPPY – U, P, P (but P already in position 1, and A missing)

Best valid candidates:
- PADDY (P A D D Y)
- PACHY (P A C H Y)
- PUDGY (P U D G Y)
- PUGGY (P U G G Y)

Among these, PUDGY and PUGGY are common words. PUDGY uses U, D, G, Y which are all allowed. PUGGY uses U, G, G, Y which is also allowed.

Choosing PUDGY as it's a common word and tests new letters U, D, G, Y.

But wait, let's verify:
PUDGY: P, U, D, G, Y
- P is confirmed in position 1 (✓)
- A is not in this word, but we know A must be in position 2 or 5. This word doesn't have A, which violates the constraint. My mistake!

Re-evaluating:
We must include A in position 2 or 5.

For A in position 2: P A _ _ _
Possible words:
- PADDY (P A D D Y) – but D is repeated, and Y is allowed
- PACHY (P A C H Y)
- PAGGY (P A G G Y)

For A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible words:
- PUDMA – but M, U, D (valid letters)
- PUGMA – G, U, M (valid letters)
- PUDMA, PUGMA are less common.

Best options:
- PADDY (P A D D Y)
- PACHY (P A C H Y)
- PAGGY (P A G G Y)

PADDY seems most common.

But let's check if any of these have excluded letters:
- P, A, D, D, Y – all allowed
- P, A, C, H, Y – all allowed
- P, A, G, G, Y – all allowed

PADDY is a valid choice.

However, PADDY has A in position 2, which is allowed (A cannot be in positions 1,3,4).

Thus, the next guess should be PADDY.

But wait, let's see if there's a better word. PACHY is also valid.

Actually, looking at common words, PACHY is not as common as PADDY. PADDY seems better.

But another thought: PUDMA and PUGMA are not common words. PUDGY doesn't have A. So the best valid options are PADDY, PACHY, PAGGY.

Among these, PAGGY is a valid word (though less common), but PADDY is more common.

However, let's check if there's a word with A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible: PUDMA, PUGMA, PUMPA (but M, P, P, A – P already in position 1, and A in 5, but PUMPA has P in 3 which is invalid because P is only confirmed in position 1). So PUMPA is invalid.

Thus, the best valid options are PADDY, PACHY, PAGGY.

PADDY seems the most common.

But let me think if there's a better word. Actually, PUDMA is not a valid word. PUGMA is not valid either.

Another candidate: PACED – but E is excluded.

PAVUK – U, K – but V is allowed, but word is obscure.

Thus, the best valid common word seems PADDY.

But wait, let me check if PADDY is valid: yes, it's a word (a type of rice).

However, another thought: PACHY is a valid word (relating to the back of a horse).

But PADDY is more common.

Actually, let me think of another approach: since A must be in position 2 or 5, and we have P fixed in position 1, let's list possible words:

Position 1: P
Position 2: A
Positions 3-5: from remaining letters (T, U, D, M, C, Y, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.)

Possible combinations:
- P A T _ _ : PATSY – but S excluded
- P A C _ _ : PACED – E excluded, PACED is 5 letters but E excluded
- P A C H Y – PACHY (valid)
- P A D D Y – PADDY (valid)
- P A G G Y – PAGGY (valid)

Similarly for A in position 5:
P _ _ _ A
- P U D G A – but G, A – but word is PUDGA (not common)
- P U G G A – PUGGA (not common)
- P U D M A – PUDMA (not common)
- P U M P A – PUMPA (but P already in 1, and P in 3 is invalid)
- P U C H A – PUCHA (not common)

Thus, the only valid common words are PACHY, PADDY, PAGGY.

Among these, PADDY seems the most common.

But let me check if there's a better word. Actually, PUDMA is not valid. PUGMA is not valid.

Thus, the best valid common word is PADDY.

However, another candidate: PACED is invalid (E excluded). PACED is 5 letters but E is excluded.

Thus, the best valid common word seems PADDY.

But wait, let me think if there's a word with A in position 5: P _ _ _ A
Possible: PUDMA, PUGMA, PUMPA, PUCHA, etc. None seem common.

Thus, the best valid common word is PACHY or PADDY.

Between PACHY and PADDY, PADDY is more common.

Thus, the next guess should be PADDY.

But let me verify:
PADDY:
- P in position 1 (✓)
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A cannot be in 1,3,4)
- D, D, Y – none of these are excluded letters
This satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is PADDY.Based on the feedback:
- P is confirmed in the first position (✓).
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from AROSE and PLAIN feedback).
- Letters R, O, S, E, L, I, N are excluded.

A must therefore be in position 2 or 5. The most common word that fits these constraints is:

Current constraints:
1. P is correct in position 1 (✓).
2. A is correct in position 2 (✓).
3. D is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from PADDY feedback: D(-) twice).
4. Y is not in the word (Y(x)).
5. Excluded letters so far: R, O, S, E, L, I, N, Y.
6. Remaining common letters: T, U, C, M, G, B, F, H, K, V, W, etc.

So the word looks like: P A _ _ _

We need two more letters, with D somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (but not both, since both were marked D(-) in PADDY). However, since both D's in PADDY were marked (-), D must appear exactly once in the word, and it must be in position 3 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- P A D _ _
- P A _ D _

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit these patterns and use only allowed letters.

For P A D _ _:
- P A D D Y – but Y is excluded.
- P A D K A – A is already in position 2, and A is allowed in position 5? Wait, A is already confirmed in position 2, and the feedback for PLAIN said A(-) meaning A is in the word but wrong position (positions 1,3,4 excluded), so A can be in position 2 or 5. Since A is already in position 2, it can also be in position 5. However, we don't know if A appears twice.

But looking at P A D _ _, possible words:
- P A D D Y – Y excluded.
- P A D G E – E excluded.
- P A D S E – S, E excluded.
- P A D R O – R, O excluded.
- P A D G E – E excluded.

For P A _ D _:
- P A U D Y – Y excluded.
- P A C D A – C, A allowed, but is PACDA a word? No.
- P A M D A – M, A allowed, but is PAMDA a word? No.
- P A T D A – T, A allowed, but PATDA is not a word.
- P A C K A – C, K, A allowed, but is PACC A a word? No.
- P A C H A – C, H, A allowed, but is PACHA a word? Yes, PACHA is a valid word (a type of ancient Andean structure).

Checking PACHA:
- P A C H A
- Letters: P, A, C, H, A
- P and A are correct in positions 1 and 2.
- C, H are new letters to test.
- A in position 5 is allowed (A can be in 2 or 5).
- No excluded letters (R, O, S, E, L, I, N, Y are all absent).

This seems to fit all constraints.

Another possible word: P A C K A – but PACKA is not standard.
P A M B A – not a word.
P A T H A – PATHA is a word (a type of musical note in some contexts), but H is allowed.

Comparing PACHA and PATHA, both are valid, but PACHA is more common in English word lists.

Thus, the next guess should be PACHA.Based on the feedback:
- P is fixed in position 1.
- A is fixed in position 2.
- D is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (so it must be in position 5, but position 5 is currently open).
- Y is excluded.
- Excluded letters: R, O, S, E, L, I, N, Y.

The pattern is P A _ _ _ with D needing to appear exactly once (since both D's in PADDY were marked (-)). The only remaining positions for D are 3 or 4, but both were marked (-), so D must appear once in position 3 or 4. However, since both D's in PADDY were marked (-), D must appear exactly once in the word, and it must be in position 3 or 4.

Looking at valid words:
- P A D _ _ : P A D D Y (Y excluded), P A D G E (E excluded), etc. No valid options.
- P A _ D _ : P A C H A (valid), P A M D A (invalid), P A T H A (valid).

Between P A C H A and P A T H A, P A C H A is more common. Therefore, the next guess is PACHA.

Current constraints:
1. P is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. A is fixed in position 2 (✓).
3. A is in the word but not in position 5 (from PACHA feedback: A(-) in position 5).
4. D is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from PADDY feedback: D(-) twice).
5. Excluded letters: R, O, S, E, L, I, N, Y, C, H.
6. Remaining common letters: T, U, M, G, B, F, K, V, W.

Word structure: P A _ _ _

D must appear exactly once and must be in position 3 or 4, but both positions were marked (-) in PADDY, meaning D cannot be in positions 3 or 4. This creates a contradiction unless D appears in position 5, but A is already in position 2 and cannot be in position 5. This suggests D must appear once in position 3 or 4, but both positions were marked (-), implying D is not in positions 3 or 4. This is impossible, so the only resolution is that D appears in position 5, but A is already in position 2 and cannot be in position 5 (from PACHA feedback: A(-) in position 5). This indicates an inconsistency, but upon closer inspection, the feedback for PACHA shows A(-) in position 5, meaning A is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore, A can only be in position 2 (already confirmed) or position 5 (but cannot be), so A must be only in position 2. This means the word has no second A, and the feedback for PACHA's last A was simply indicating A is not in position 5.

Revised constraints:
- P A _ _ _
- D must appear once, and positions 3 and 4 were both marked (-) in PADDY, meaning D is not in positions 3 or 4. This is impossible unless D appears in position 5, but position 5 is open. However, from PACHA feedback, A is not in position 5, but D could be. But this would make the word P A _ _ D, but positions 3 and 4 must be filled with remaining letters.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- PADDY feedback: P(✓) A(✓) D(-) D(-) Y(x) - D is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.
- PACHA feedback: P(✓) A(✓) C(x) H(x) A(-) - A is in the word but not in position 5 (but already in position 2).

This implies D must be in position 5, and positions 3 and 4 must be filled with other allowed letters. So the word is P A _ _ D.

Allowed letters for positions 3 and 4: from remaining common letters T, U, M, G, B, F, K, V, W, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words: P A _ _ D.
