For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words in Wordle often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Looking at some good starting words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several common letters and vowels. Another good option is ""AROSE"" or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which should give good initial feedback.

From the new feedback on EARNS:

- R(-): R is in the word but NOT in position 3  
- N(x): N is NOT in the word  
- S(✓): S is in the word AND in position 5 (correct spot)

So now we know:
Letters in the word: A, R, S, E  
Letter definitely NOT in the word: O, T, N  
Position of S is fixed: position 5  
Positions ruled out for each:
- A: positions 1, 2, 3 (from earlier and now) → must be in 4  
- R: positions 2, 3, 4 (from earlier and now) → must be in 1  
- E: positions 1, 4, 5 (from earlier and now) → must be in 2 or 3  
- S: fixed at 5  

We have:
1: R  
2: ? (E or other)  
3: ? (E or other)  
4: A  
5: S  

We need two more letters to fill positions 2 and 3, but we already have A, R, S, E.  
Wait – we only need one more distinct letter (since we already have A, R, S, E).  
But we have 5 positions and only 4 letters.  
Actually, we must use exactly those four letters plus one more, but we already have four letters.  
Wait – no, the word must be exactly those four letters plus one more, but we have four letters and five positions.  
But we know we have exactly those four letters (A, R, S, E) plus one more letter (not O, T, N).  
But from the feedback, the word must contain A, R, S, E and one other letter (not O, T, N).  

But we have:
- R must be in position 1  
- A must be in position 4  
- S must be in position 5  

So the word looks like: R _ _ A S  

We need to place E in position 2 or 3, and we need one more letter in the remaining position.  
But we have only four letters (A, R, S, E) and five positions.  
Wait, this suggests we need one more letter.  

But we have four letters and five positions.  
This implies the word must contain A, R, S, E and one more letter.  
But from the feedback, we have:
- R in position 1  
- A in position 4  
- S in position 5  

So positions 2 and 3 must be filled with E and another letter (not O, T, N).  
But we have only E left to place, so the other letter must be one of the four (but we already have all four).  
This suggests the word must be R E _ A S or R _ E A S, but we need a valid word.  

Looking at possible valid words:
- R E A S E – but that repeats E.  
- R E A D S – but D is allowed (not O, T, N).  
- R E A D S – but does it fit?  
- R E A D S: positions 1=R, 2=E, 3=D, 4=A, 5=S.  
Check constraints:
- E is in position 2: allowed (forbidden positions 1, 4, 5)  
- D is new letter, allowed.  
This seems valid.  

Another possibility: R E A S E – but E is already in position 5 (forbidden).  
R E A D S seems the best fit.  

Let me check if there's another word:  
R E A D S – valid English word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words in Wordle often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Looking at some good starting words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several common letters and vowels. Another good option is ""AROSE"" or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which should give good initial feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2)
- O(x): O is NOT in the word
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4)
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5)

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, S, E
- Letter definitely out: O
- Positions to avoid for each of those letters:
  - A cannot be in position 1
  - R cannot be in position 2
  - S cannot be in position 4
  - E cannot be in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, R, S, E and one more letter (not O), while respecting the positional constraints.

Possible letters to add: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc.

Let's try ""STARE"":
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S was in position 4 last time)
- T is a new letter
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A was in position 1 last time)
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since R was in position 2 last time)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since E was in position 5 last time)

This uses all four known letters in new positions and adds T.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Known letters that are in the word: A, R, S, E  
Known letters that are NOT in the word: O, T  

Forbidden positions for each known letter:
- A: cannot be in positions 1 or 3  
- R: cannot be in positions 2 or 4  
- S: cannot be in positions 4 or 1  
- E: cannot be in positions 5 or 4  

We still need one more distinct letter (not O or T) to fill the fifth spot.  
Good remaining consonants to try: N, L, C, D, B, G, etc.

Let’s construct a word that:
1. Contains exactly the four known letters (A, R, S, E) plus one new letter.
2. Places each of A, R, S, E in still-allowed positions.

One promising arrangement:  
- Put A in position 2 (allowed)  
- Put R in position 1 (allowed)  
- Put S in position 3 (allowed)  
- Put E in position 5 (allowed)  
- Add N in position 4.

This gives the word “RASNE” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Try swapping: “RASEN” – also invalid.  
Swap again: “REANS” – invalid.  
Swap to “EARNS” – valid English word.

Check constraints:
- E in position 1: allowed (only forbidden positions for E were 4 and 5)  
- A in position 2: allowed (forbidden positions 1 and 3)  
- R in position 3: allowed (forbidden positions 2 and 4)  
- S in position 4: forbidden! (S cannot be in position 4)

Oops, S is now in position 4 – forbidden.  
Shift S to position 5 and E to position 4:  
Word becomes “EARNS” – E in 1, A in 2, R in 3, N in 4, S in 5.  
Check positions:
- E: position 1 – allowed  
- A: position 2 – allowed  
- R: position 3 – allowed  
- S: position 5 – allowed  
- N: new letter, allowed.

“EARNS” is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words in Wordle often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Looking at some good starting words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several common letters and vowels. Another good option is ""AROSE"" or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which should give good initial feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2)
- O(x): O is NOT in the word
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4)
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5)

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, S, E
- Letter definitely out: O
- Positions to avoid for each of those letters:
  - A cannot be in position 1
  - R cannot be in position 2
  - S cannot be in position 4
  - E cannot be in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, R, S, E and one more letter (not O), while respecting the positional constraints.

Possible letters to add: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc.

Let's try ""STARE"":
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S was in position 4 last time)
- T is a new letter
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A was in position 1 last time)
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since R was in position 2 last time)
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since E was in position 5 last time)

This uses all four known letters in new positions and adds T.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Known letters that are in the word: A, R, S, E  
Known letters that are NOT in the word: O, T  

Forbidden positions for each known letter:
- A: cannot be in positions 1 or 3  
- R: cannot be in positions 2 or 4  
- S: cannot be in positions 4 or 1  
- E: cannot be in positions 5 or 4  

We still need one more distinct letter (not O or T) to fill the fifth spot.  
Good remaining consonants to try: N, L, C, D, B, G, etc.

Let’s construct a word that:
1. Contains exactly the four known letters (A, R, S, E) plus one new letter.
2. Places each of A, R, S, E in still-allowed positions.

One promising arrangement:  
- Put A in position 2 (allowed)  
- Put R in position 1 (allowed)  
- Put S in position 3 (allowed)  
- Put E in position 5 (allowed)  
- Add N in position 4.

This gives the word “RASNE” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Try swapping: “RASEN” – also invalid.  
Swap again: “REANS” – invalid.  
Swap to “EARNS” – valid English word.

Check constraints:
- E in position 1: allowed (only forbidden positions for E were 4 and 5)  
- A in position 2: allowed (forbidden positions 1 and 3)  
- R in position 3: allowed (forbidden positions 2 and 4)  
- S in position 4: forbidden! (S cannot be in position 4)

Oops, S is now in position 4 – forbidden.  
Shift S to position 5 and E to position 4:  
Word becomes “EARNS” – E in 1, A in 2, R in 3, N in 4, S in 5.  
Check positions:
- E: position 1 – allowed  
- A: position 2 – allowed  
- R: position 3 – allowed  
- S: position 5 – allowed  
- N: new letter, allowed.

“EARNS” is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

Guess 3: EARNS -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(-) R(-) N(x) S(✓)

From the new feedback on EARNS:
- E(-): E is in the word but NOT in position 1  
- A(-): A is in the word but NOT in position 2  
- R(-): R is in the word but NOT in position 3  
- N(x): N is NOT in the word  
- S(✓): S is in the word AND in position 5 (correct spot)

So now we know:
Letters in the word: A, R, S, E  
Letter definitely NOT in the word: O, T, N  
Position of S is fixed: position 5  
Positions ruled out for each:
- A: positions 1, 2, 3 (from earlier and now) → must be in 4  
- R: positions 2, 3, 4 (from earlier and now) → must be in 1  
- E: positions 1, 4, 5 (from earlier and now) → must be in 2 or 3  
- S: fixed at 5  

We have:
1: R  
2: ? (E or other)  
3: ? (E or other)  
4: A  
5: S  

We need two more letters to fill positions 2 and 3, but we already have A, R, S, E.  
Wait – we only need one more distinct letter (since we already have A, R, S, E).  
But we have 5 positions and only 4 letters.  
Actually, we must use exactly those four letters plus one more, but we already have four letters.  
Wait – no, the word must be exactly those four letters plus one more, but we have four letters and five positions.  
But we know we have exactly those four letters (A, R, S, E) plus one more letter (not O, T, N).  
But from the feedback, the word must contain A, R, S, E and one other letter (not O, T, N).  

But we have:
- R must be in position 1  
- A must be in position 4  
- S must be in position 5  

So the word looks like: R _ _ A S  

We need to place E in position 2 or 3, and we need one more letter in the remaining position.  
But we have only four letters (A, R, S, E) and five positions.  
Wait, this suggests we need one more letter.  

But we have four letters and five positions.  
This implies the word must contain A, R, S, E and one more letter.  
But from the feedback, we have:
- R in position 1  
- A in position 4  
- S in position 5  

So positions 2 and 3 must be filled with E and another letter (not O, T, N).  
But we have only E left to place, so the other letter must be one of the four (but we already have all four).  
This suggests the word must be R E _ A S or R _ E A S, but we need a valid word.  

Looking at possible valid words:
- R E A S E – but that repeats E.  
- R E A D S – but D is allowed (not O, T, N).  
- R E A D S – but does it fit?  
- R E A D S: positions 1=R, 2=E, 3=D, 4=A, 5=S.  
Check constraints:
- E is in position 2: allowed (forbidden positions 1, 4, 5)  
- D is new letter, allowed.  
This seems valid.  

Another possibility: R E A S E – but E is already in position 5 (forbidden).  
R E A D S seems the best fit.  

Let me check if there's another word:  
R E A D S – valid English word.  

So the next guess is READS.

From the feedback on REAPS:
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 1  
- E(✓) – E is correct in position 2  
- A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 3  
- P(-) – P is in the word but NOT in position 4  
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 5  

So the pattern is: R E _ _ S  

We know the letters that must appear: R, E, A, P, S  
We know the letters that are out: O, T, N, D  

Positions:
1: R (fixed)  
2: E (fixed)  
3: cannot be A (from REAPS feedback)  
4: cannot be P (from REAPS feedback)  
5: S (fixed)  

We need to place A and P in positions 3 and 4, but:
- A cannot be in position 3 → A must be in position 4  
- P cannot be in position 4 → P must be in position 3  

Thus the only possible arrangement is: R E P A S  

Check if this is a valid English word: “REAPS” – yes, it is (past tense of reap).  
But we just guessed REAPS and got P(-), meaning P is in the word but not in position 4.  
In REAPS, P is in position 3, which is allowed (only position 4 is forbidden for P).  
However, the word REAPS itself was already guessed and the feedback was P(-), not P(✓).  
This suggests that P is in the word but not in position 3 (since P(-) means it’s in the word but wrong position).  

Wait, let’s re-examine the feedback:
- P(-) means P is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
So P could be in positions 3 or 5, but 5 is already S.  
Thus P must be in position 3.  

Therefore the only possible word is REPAS, but REPAS is not an English word.  
This indicates an inconsistency, meaning our assumption must be wrong.  

Let’s re-evaluate:
We have letters R, E, A, P, S to place in positions 1-5 with:
1: R  
2: E  
5: S  

We need to place A and P in positions 3 and 4 with:
- A cannot be in position 3 (from REAPS feedback) → A must be in position 4  
- P cannot be in position 4 (from REAPS feedback) → P must be in position 3  

Thus the word must be REPAS, but REPAS is not valid.  
This implies we have missed a letter.  

Looking back, the word must be exactly 5 letters and we have:
Letters known to be in the word: R, E, A, P, S  
Positions fixed: 1=R, 2=E, 5=S  
Positions left: 3 and 4 to fill with A and P, but neither can be in their previous positions.  

The only way this works is if the word is REPAS, but since that’s invalid, we must have made an error.  

Realizing that the word must be “REAPS” itself, but the feedback on REAPS was P(-), meaning P is in the word but not in position 4.  
In REAPS, P is in position 3, which is allowed (only position 4 was forbidden).  
However, the feedback for REAPS was P(-), which suggests P is not in position 4, but could be elsewhere.  
Thus, REAPS is actually the correct word, and the feedback must have been misinterpreted.  

Therefore, the secret word is REAPS.
