For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me a good chance to identify or eliminate several key letters right away.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R, O, E are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 4th).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E
- Letters definitely in the word (but positions unknown): A, S
- We need a 5-letter word that contains both A and S, does NOT contain R, O, E, and places A and S in new positions.

Good candidates would use remaining common letters (T, N, L, I, C, U, etc.) and must include A and S.  
A quick scan of common words: “SALTY” (but has Y which is less common), “STAIN” (but has I and N), “SLANT” (but has N and T).  
“STAIN” uses S, T, A, I, N — all still possible letters, and moves A to position 3 and S to position 1, which are new positions.

Let’s try “STAIN”.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S.  
- It contains A, but A is not in position 1 or 3.  
- It does NOT contain R, O, E, T, I, N.

Remaining common letters to try: L, U, C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A (but not in positions 1 or 3), and using none of the eliminated letters.

Let’s try a word like “SALAD” – but it repeats A, and we don’t know if letters can repeat.  
“SALAD” also uses L and D, both still possible.  
Another option: “SHACK” – but K is less common.  
“SCALD” – uses C, L, D.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me a good chance to identify or eliminate several key letters right away.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R, O, E are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 4th).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E
- Letters definitely in the word (but positions unknown): A, S
- We need a 5-letter word that contains both A and S, does NOT contain R, O, E, and places A and S in new positions.

Good candidates would use remaining common letters (T, N, L, I, C, U, etc.) and must include A and S.  
A quick scan of common words: “SALTY” (but has Y which is less common), “STAIN” (but has I and N), “SLANT” (but has N and T).  
“STAIN” uses S, T, A, I, N — all still possible letters, and moves A to position 3 and S to position 1, which are new positions.

Let’s try “STAIN”.

From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – R, O, E are not in the word.

2. stain → S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)  
   – S is now confirmed in position 1.  
   – A is in the word but not in position 3 (and we already knew it’s not in position 1).  
   – T, I, N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S.  
- It contains A, but A is not in position 1 or 3.  
- It does NOT contain R, O, E, T, I, N.

Remaining common letters to try: L, U, C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A (but not in positions 1 or 3), and using none of the eliminated letters.  
Possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5.  
Let’s try a word like “SALAD” – but it repeats A, and we don’t know if letters can repeat.  
“SALAD” also uses L and D, both still possible.  
Another option: “SHACK” – but K is less common.  
“SCALD” – uses C, L, D.  
“SALTY” – uses L, T (but T is eliminated).  
“SALAD” seems the best so far.

Let’s verify:
- S in position 1 (✓ from feedback).  
- A in position 2 (new position).  
- L and D are still possible.  
- No R, O, E, T, I, N.

“SALAD” looks valid.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me a good chance to identify or eliminate several key letters right away.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R, O, E are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 4th).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E
- Letters definitely in the word (but positions unknown): A, S
- We need a 5-letter word that contains both A and S, does NOT contain R, O, E, and places A and S in new positions.

Good candidates would use remaining common letters (T, N, L, I, C, U, etc.) and must include A and S.  
A quick scan of common words: “SALTY” (but has Y which is less common), “STAIN” (but has I and N), “SLANT” (but has N and T).  
“STAIN” uses S, T, A, I, N — all still possible letters, and moves A to position 3 and S to position 1, which are new positions.

Let’s try “STAIN”.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: stain -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – R, O, E are not in the word.

2. stain → S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)  
   – S is now confirmed in position 1.  
   – A is in the word but not in position 3 (and we already knew it’s not in position 1).  
   – T, I, N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S.  
- It contains A, but A is not in position 1 or 3.  
- It does NOT contain R, O, E, T, I, N.

Remaining common letters to try: L, U, C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A (but not in positions 1 or 3), and using none of the eliminated letters.  
Possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5.  
Let’s try a word like “SALAD” – but it repeats A, and we don’t know if letters can repeat.  
“SALAD” also uses L and D, both still possible.  
Another option: “SHACK” – but K is less common.  
“SCALD” – uses C, L, D.  
“SALTY” – uses L, T (but T is eliminated).  
“SALAD” seems the best so far.

Let’s verify:
- S in position 1 (✓ from feedback).  
- A in position 2 (new position).  
- L and D are still possible.  
- No R, O, E, T, I, N.

“SALAD” looks valid.

Guess 3: salam -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) A(✓) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – R, O, E are not in the word.

2. stain → S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)  
   – S is confirmed in position 1.  
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – T, I, N are not in the word.

3. salam → S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) A(✓) M(x)  
   – S is confirmed in position 1.  
   – A is confirmed in positions 2 and 4.  
   – L is confirmed in position 3.  
   – M is not in the word.

So we now know the exact pattern: S A L A _ (positions 1-4) and the last letter is unknown.

Letters already ruled out: R, O, E, T, I, N, M.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with SALA and ends with any letter except those ruled out.  
Possible endings: common letters left include D, G, H, K, P, U, Y, etc.

“SALAD” ends with D (still allowed).  
“SALAD” fits the pattern S A L A D.

Let’s verify:
- S in position 1 (✓)  
- A in positions 2 and 4 (✓)  
- L in position 3 (✓)  
- D has not been eliminated.  
- No other ruled-out letters are used.

Therefore, “SALAD” is the logical next guess.

3. salam → S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) A(✓) M(x)  
   – S is confirmed in position 1.  
   – A is confirmed in positions 2 and 4.  
   – L is confirmed in position 3.  
   – M is not in the word.

4. salam → S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) A(✓) M(x)  
   – Repeats the same information; no new constraints.

Current known pattern: S A L A _ (positions 1-4)  
Letters already ruled out: R, O, E, T, I, N, M  
Remaining possible letters for position 5: D, G, H, K, P, U, Y, etc.

The only common 5-letter word that fits S A L A _ and uses an allowed letter is “SALAD” (D is still allowed).  
All other possibilities (SALAG, SALAH, SALAK, SALAP, SALAU, SALAY) are either non-words or use less common letters.

Therefore, the secret word must be SALAD.
