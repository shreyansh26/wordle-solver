### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Avoids repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these.

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 5 unique letters
- All letters (A, R, O, S, E) are among the most common
- It's a valid 5-letter word
- It gives us information about 5 different letters in one go

From the new feedback on ""track"":
- T(✓) : T is correct in position 1.

- A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 3.
- C(x) : C is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with T.
- Contains R, A, K.
- R ≠ position 2, A ≠ position 3, K ≠ position 5.
- Excluded letters: O, S, E, I, N, C.

Possible positions:
- R can be in 3, 4, or 5.
- A can be in 2, 4, or 5.
- K can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 1 is already T).

We need a 5-letter word starting with T, containing R, A, K, with the above positional constraints.

Possible structure: T _ _ _ _
We need to place R, A, K in positions 2-5 with constraints:
- R not in 2, A not in 3, K not in 5.

Let's list possible arrangements:
- Position 2: could be A or K or R (but R can't be 2)
- Position 3: could be A or K or R (but A can't be 3)
- Position 4: could be A or K or R
- Position 5: could be R or A or K (but K can't be 5)

Let's try to find a valid word:
Option 1: T A R K _
But K would be in position 4, which is allowed, and R in 3 is allowed. We need a 5th letter that is not excluded. The 5th letter must be one we haven't tested yet. From excluded letters we have O, S, E, I, N, C. Remaining common letters: D, L, M, P, U, G, B, etc.

""tarke"" is not a word. ""tarka"" is a word (a type of sheep). Let's check:
- T A R K A
Positions:
- T(1) ✓
- A(2) (allowed, since A not restricted to 3)
- R(3) (allowed, since R not restricted to 2)
- K(4) (allowed, since K not restricted to 5)
- A(5) (allowed, since A not restricted to 3)
But we already have A in position 2, and the word would have two A's. Is that possible? The feedback didn't indicate any duplicates, but we don't know for sure. Let's see if there's a better option.

Option 2: T A K R _
But K would be in position 3, R in 4. We need a 5th letter. ""takru"" isn't a word. ""takra"" is a word (a type of Indian dance). Let's check:
- T A K R A
Positions:
- T(1) ✓
- A(2) (allowed)
- K(3) (allowed)
- R(4) (allowed)
- A(5) (allowed)
Again, two A's.

Option 3: T R A K _
But A would be in position 3, which is disallowed.

Option 4: T R K A _
But R would be in position 2, which is disallowed.

Option 5: T K A R _
But K would be in position 2, A in 3 (disallowed).

Option 6: T A R _ K
But K would be in position 5, which is disallowed.

Option 7: T A _ R K
But K would be in 5, disallowed.

Option 8: T A _ K R
But R would be in 5, allowed. We need a 3rd letter. ""t a _ k r"". Possible letters: D, L, M, P, U, G, B, etc. ""t a p k r"" isn't a word. ""t a m k r"" isn't. ""t a d k r"" isn't. ""t a g k r"" isn't. ""t a b k r"" isn't. ""t a l k r"" isn't.

Option 9: T _ A R K
But K would be in 5, disallowed.

Option 10: T _ R A K
But K would be in 5, disallowed.

Option 11: T _ R K A
This seems promising:
- T _ R K A
Positions:
- T(1) ✓
- _ (position 2): must be one of the remaining letters (not excluded)
- R(3) (allowed, since R not restricted to 2)
- K(4) (allowed, since K not restricted to 5)
- A(5) (allowed, since A not restricted to 3)
We need a letter for position 2 that is not excluded. Possible: D, L, M, P, U, G, B, etc. ""t d r k a"" isn't a word. ""t l r k a"" isn't. ""t m r k a"" isn't. ""t p r k a"" isn't. ""t g r k a"" isn't. ""t b r k a"" isn't. ""t f r k a"" isn't. ""t h r k a"" isn't. ""t j r k a"" isn't. ""t q r k a"" isn't. ""t v r k a"" isn't. ""t w r k a"" isn't. ""t y r k a"" isn't. ""t z r k a"" isn't. 

Hmm, this path isn't working. Let's try ""t a r k a"" even with the double A, since it's a valid word.

""tarka"" is a valid 5-letter word (a type of sheep), and fits all constraints:
