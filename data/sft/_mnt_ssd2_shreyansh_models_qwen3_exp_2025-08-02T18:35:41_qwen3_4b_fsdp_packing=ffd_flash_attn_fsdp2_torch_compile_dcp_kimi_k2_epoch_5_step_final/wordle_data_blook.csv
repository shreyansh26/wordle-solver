For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This will give me good coverage to determine which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

Good remaining common consonants: R, N, D, C, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

Let me think of words that fit _ L _ _ _ and avoid the eliminated letters. Possible candidates:
- CLINK (but has K, which is less common)

Let's summarize what we know so far.

Pattern so far: _ L _ _ _
Eliminated letters: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G, D, R
Letters still allowed: B, C, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, O, U, L

From Guess 3 (DROLL):
- D(x), R(x) – already known eliminated.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct 4th position.
- L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in 2nd or 5th positions (already 2nd is correct, so this tells us L is not in 5th, which we already knew).

So the pattern is now: _ L _ O _

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has L in 2nd position
- Has O in 4th position
- Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible letters left: B, C, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, O, U, L

Looking for words fitting _ L _ O _:
- BLOWN – but N is eliminated
- CLOWN – N is eliminated
- HULKO – not a valid word
- MULCH – doesn't fit _ L _ O _
- PULPY – doesn't fit

Wait, let's think systematically. We need _ L _ O _ with allowed letters.

Possible letters for 1st, 3rd, 5th positions: B, C, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, U

Possible combinations:
- B L U O _ – but 5th needs to be allowed letter, e.g., B L U O K → ""BLUOK"" – not valid
- B L U O M → ""BLUOM"" – not valid
- C L U O _ → C L U O B – ""CLUBO"" – not valid
- C L U O M – ""CLUMO"" – not valid
- H L U O _ – ""HLUOW"" – not valid
- K L U O _ – ""KLUOW"" – not valid
- M L U O _ – ""MLUOW"" – not valid
- P L U O _ – ""PLUOW"" – not valid
- V L U O _ – ""VLUOW"" – not valid
- W L U O _ – ""WLUMO"" – not valid
- Y L U O _ – ""YLUMO"" – not valid

This suggests we might need to use U in another position. Let's try U in 3rd or 5th.

Looking for valid words:
- B L U O _ – no valid words
- B L _ O U – ""BL_OU"" – e.g., ""BL OU"" – but need 5 letters
- C L U O _ – no valid words
- C L _ O U – ""CL_OU"" – e.g., ""CLOU"" – but need 5 letters
- M L U O _ – no valid words
- M L _ O U – ""ML_OU"" – e.g., ""ML O U"" – but need 5 letters
- P L U O _ – no valid words
- P L _ O U – ""PL_OU"" – e.g., ""PL OU"" – but need 5 letters

Actually, let's think of real words that fit _ L _ O _ with allowed letters.

Possible words:
- BLOWN – N eliminated
- CLOWN – N eliminated
- HULKO – not valid
- MULCH – doesn't fit
- PULPY – doesn't fit
- VULTU – not valid
- CUBOL – not valid
- BLOW – too short
- CLOW – too short
- PLOW – doesn't fit
- VULTU – not valid
- CUBOL – not valid

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the word is ""BLUM"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

Looking at remaining letters, perhaps ""BLOOM"" but O is already in 4th, and we can't have two O's? Or can we?

""BLOOM"" – positions: B L O O M – but O is supposed to be in 4th, so this would have O in 3rd and 4th, which might be allowed, but we don't know if O can appear twice.

However, we have no information that O cannot appear twice. Let's check if ""BLOOM"" is valid:
- B: allowed
- L: allowed
- O: allowed
- O: allowed
- M: allowed

But ""BLOOM"" has O in 3rd and 4th, which would fit _ L O O M, but we only know O is in 4th. This might not be the right path.

Another approach: list all valid 5-letter words fitting _ L _ O _ with allowed letters.

Valid words:
- BLOWN – N eliminated
- CLOWN – N eliminated
- HULKO – not valid
- MULCH – doesn't fit
- PULPY – doesn't fit
- VULTU – not valid
- CUBOL – not valid
- BLOW – too short
- CLOW – too short
- PLOW – doesn't fit
- VULTU – not valid
- CUBOL – not valid

This is tricky. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps ""BLOOM"" is the intended word, even with two O's. Let's consider it.

""BLOOM"" – positions: B(1) L(2) O(3) O(4) M(5)
But we know O is in 4th, so this would place O in both 3rd and 4th, which might be possible.

However, let's check if there are any other words. Another possibility is ""BLOKE"" but E is eliminated.

Actually, let me think of ""BLOOM"" as a valid candidate.

But let me double-check if there are other words. 

Another possibility is ""BLOOM"" or ""CLOMP"" but doesn't fit.

Wait, ""BLOOM"" seems to be the only valid word fitting _ L _ O _ with allowed letters. Let me verify:

""BLOOM"":
- B: allowed
- L: allowed (2nd position)
- O: allowed (3rd)
- O: allowed (4th)
- M: allowed

This seems to fit all constraints.

Therefore, my next guess is ""BLOOM"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This will give me good coverage to determine which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- A, T, E are NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ L _ _ _

Letters we can eliminate: S, A, T, E

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has L in the 2nd position
2. Does NOT contain S, A, T, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Good remaining common consonants: R, N, D, C, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

Let me think of words that fit _ L _ _ _ and avoid the eliminated letters. Possible candidates:
- CLINK (but has K, which is less common)
- FLING (but has F and N, which are good)
- BLIMP (but has B and M, which are good)
- GLINT (but has G and N, which are good)
- PLUMB (but has P and U, which are good)

I'll choose ""FLING"" because it uses common letters (F, L, I, N, G) and gives good coverage for remaining vowels and consonants.

From the two previous guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - Pattern: _ L _ _ _
   - Eliminated letters: S, A, T, E

2. FLING → F(x) L(✓) I(x) N(x) G(x)
   - Pattern still: _ L _ _ _
   - Additional eliminated letters: F, I, N, G

Current constraints:
- 2nd letter = L
- Eliminated letters: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, H, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: O, U

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has L in 2nd position
- Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters
- Uses remaining common letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- BLOOM (but O is allowed and M is common)
- CLOWN (but W is allowed and N is already eliminated)
- BLOKE (but K is allowed and E is eliminated)
- DROLL (but D, R, O are allowed)
- CLOWD (but D is allowed)
- MOLLY (but Y is allowed and M is common)

Looking at these, ""BLOOM"" seems good because it uses B, O, M which are all still allowed and common. However, it has two O's which might not give much new info. 

Another good option is ""DROLL"" - it uses D, R, O, L, L. This gives info on D, R, O.

Between these, I'll go with ""DROLL"" as it tests three new common letters (D, R, O) while fitting the pattern and avoiding eliminated letters.

- D(x), R(x) – already known eliminated.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct 4th position.
- L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in 2nd or 5th positions (already 2nd is correct, so this tells us L is not in 5th, which we already knew).

So the pattern is now: _ L _ O _

- Has L in 2nd position
- Has O in 4th position
- Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters

- CUBOL – not valid
- BLOW – too short
- CLOW – too short
- PLOW – doesn't fit
- VULTU – not valid
- CUBOL – not valid

This is tricky. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps ""BLOOM"" is the intended word, even with two O's. Let's consider it.

""BLOOM"" – positions: B(1) L(2) O(3) O(4) M(5)
But we know O is in 4th, so this would place O in both 3rd and 4th, which might be possible.

However, let's check if there are any other words. Another possibility is ""BLOKE"" but E is eliminated.

Actually, let me think of ""BLOOM"" as a valid candidate.

But let me double-check if there are other words. 

Another possibility is ""BLOOM"" or ""CLOMP"" but doesn't fit.

Wait, ""BLOOM"" seems to be the only valid word fitting _ L _ O _ with allowed letters. Let me verify:

""BLOOM"":
- B: allowed
- L: allowed (2nd position)
- O: allowed (3rd)
- O: allowed (4th)
- M: allowed

This seems to fit all constraints.

Therefore, my next guess is ""BLOOM"".From the feedback so far:
- Pattern: _ L _ O _
- Eliminated letters: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G, D, R
- Remaining allowed letters: B, C, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, O, U, L

The only valid 5-letter word fitting _ L _ O _ with these constraints is ""BLOOM"".

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This will give me good coverage to determine which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- A, T, E are NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ L _ _ _

Letters we can eliminate: S, A, T, E

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has L in the 2nd position
2. Does NOT contain S, A, T, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Good remaining common consonants: R, N, D, C, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

Let me think of words that fit _ L _ _ _ and avoid the eliminated letters. Possible candidates:
- CLINK (but has K, which is less common)
- FLING (but has F and N, which are good)
- BLIMP (but has B and M, which are good)
- GLINT (but has G and N, which are good)
- PLUMB (but has P and U, which are good)

I'll choose ""FLING"" because it uses common letters (F, L, I, N, G) and gives good coverage for remaining vowels and consonants.

2. FLING → F(x) L(✓) I(x) N(x) G(x)
   - Pattern still: _ L _ _ _
   - Additional eliminated letters: F, I, N, G

Current constraints:
- 2nd letter = L
- Eliminated letters: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, H, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: O, U

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has L in 2nd position
- Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters
- Uses remaining common letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- BLOOM (but O is allowed and M is common)
- CLOWN (but W is allowed and N is already eliminated)
- BLOKE (but K is allowed and E is eliminated)
- DROLL (but D, R, O are allowed)
- CLOWD (but D is allowed)
- MOLLY (but Y is allowed and M is common)

Looking at these, ""BLOOM"" seems good because it uses B, O, M which are all still allowed and common. However, it has two O's which might not give much new info. 

Another good option is ""DROLL"" - it uses D, R, O, L, L. This gives info on D, R, O.

Between these, I'll go with ""DROLL"" as it tests three new common letters (D, R, O) while fitting the pattern and avoiding eliminated letters.

Let's summarize what we know so far.

Pattern so far: _ L _ _ _
Eliminated letters: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G, D, R
Letters still allowed: B, C, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, O, U, L

From Guess 3 (DROLL):
- D(x), R(x) – already known eliminated.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct 4th position.
- L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in 2nd or 5th positions (already 2nd is correct, so this tells us L is not in 5th, which we already knew).

So the pattern is now: _ L _ O _

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has L in 2nd position
- Has O in 4th position
- Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible letters left: B, C, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, O, U, L

Looking for words fitting _ L _ O _:
- BLOWN – but N is eliminated
- CLOWN – N is eliminated
- HULKO – not a valid word
- MULCH – doesn't fit _ L _ O _
- PULPY – doesn't fit
- WHELP – doesn't fit
- BLOOM – doesn't fit

- B L U O _ – but 5th needs to be allowed letter, e.g., B L U O K → ""BLUOK"" – not valid
- B L U O M → ""BLUOM"" – not valid
- C L U O _ → C L U O B – ""CLUBO"" – not valid
- C L U O M – ""CLUMO"" – not valid
- H L U O _ – ""HLUOW"" – not valid
- K L U O _ – ""KLUOW"" – not valid
- M L U O _ – ""MLUOW"" – not valid
- P L U O _ – ""PLUOW"" – not valid
- V L U O _ – ""VLUOW"" – not valid
- W L U O _ – ""WLUMO"" – not valid
- Y L U O _ – ""YLUMO"" – not valid

This suggests we might need to use U in another position. Let's try U in 3rd or 5th.

Looking for valid words:
- B L U O _ – no valid words
- B L _ O U – ""BL_OU"" – e.g., ""BL OU"" – but need 5 letters
- C L U O _ – no valid words
- C L _ O U – ""CL_OU"" – e.g., ""CLOU"" – but need 5 letters
- M L U O _ – no valid words
- M L _ O U – ""ML_OU"" – e.g., ""ML O U"" – but need 5 letters
- P L U O _ – no valid words
- P L _ O U – ""PL_OU"" – e.g., ""PL OU"" – but need 5 letters

Actually, let's think of real words that fit _ L _ O _ with allowed letters.

Possible words:
- BLOWN – N eliminated
- CLOWN – N eliminated
- HULKO – not valid
- MULCH – doesn't fit
- PULPY – doesn't fit
- VULTU – not valid
- CUBOL – not valid
- BLOW – too short
- CLOW – too short
- PLOW – doesn't fit
- VULTU – not valid
- CUBOL – not valid

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the word is ""BLUM"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.

Looking at remaining letters, perhaps ""BLOOM"" but O is already in 4th, and we can't have two O's? Or can we?

""BLOOM"" – positions: B L O O M – but O is supposed to be in 4th, so this would have O in 3rd and 4th, which might be allowed, but we don't know if O can appear twice.

However, we have no information that O cannot appear twice. Let's check if ""BLOOM"" is valid:
- B: allowed
- L: allowed
- O: allowed
- O: allowed
- M: allowed

But ""BLOOM"" has O in 3rd and 4th, which would fit _ L O O M, but we only know O is in 4th. This might not be the right path.

Another approach: list all valid 5-letter words fitting _ L _ O _ with allowed letters.

Valid words:
- BLOWN – N eliminated
- CLOWN – N eliminated
- HULKO – not valid
- MULCH – doesn't fit
- PULPY – doesn't fit
- VULTU – not valid
- CUBOL – not valid
- BLOW – too short
- CLOW – too short
- PLOW – doesn't fit
- VULTU – not valid
- CUBOL – not valid

This is tricky. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps ""BLOOM"" is the intended word, even with two O's. Let's consider it.

""BLOOM"" – positions: B(1) L(2) O(3) O(4) M(5)
But we know O is in 4th, so this would place O in both 3rd and 4th, which might be possible.

However, let's check if there are any other words. Another possibility is ""BLOKE"" but E is eliminated.

Actually, let me think of ""BLOOM"" as a valid candidate.

But let me double-check if there are other words. 

Another possibility is ""BLOOM"" or ""CLOMP"" but doesn't fit.

Wait, ""BLOOM"" seems to be the only valid word fitting _ L _ O _ with allowed letters. Let me verify:

""BLOOM"":
- B: allowed
- L: allowed (2nd position)
- O: allowed (3rd)
- O: allowed (4th)
- M: allowed

This seems to fit all constraints.

Therefore, my next guess is ""BLOOM"".From the feedback so far:
- Pattern: _ L _ O _
- Eliminated letters: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G, D, R
- Remaining allowed letters: B, C, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, O, U, L

The only valid 5-letter word fitting _ L _ O _ with these constraints is ""BLOOM"".

From the four guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(✓) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   Pattern: _ L _ _ _  
   Eliminated letters: S, A, T, E  

2. FLING → F(x) L(✓) I(x) N(x) G(x)  
   Pattern still _ L _ _ _  
   Additional eliminated letters: F, I, N, G  

3. DROLL → D(x) R(x) O(✓) L(-) L(-)  
   - O is now known to be in the correct 4th position → _ L _ O _  
   - L is confirmed in 2nd position (already known) and not in 5th position (so L must be in 2nd or 3rd, but 2nd is already correct, so L is not in 3rd or 5th – but we already have L in 2nd, so this just re-affirms L is only in 2nd).  
   - Additional eliminated letters: D, R  

4. BLOOM → B(✓) L(✓) O(✓) O(✓) M(x)  
   - B is correct in 1st position → B L _ O _  
   - L is correct in 2nd position (already known)  
   - O is correct in 4th position (already known)  
   - M is NOT in the word → eliminated letters now include M  

Current pattern: B L _ O _  
Eliminated letters so far: S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G, D, R, M  

Letters still allowed: C, H, K, P, V, W, Y, U, L (but L is already in 2nd)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with B L
- Has O in 4th position
- Uses only allowed letters (no S, A, T, E, F, I, N, G, D, R, M)
- Uses remaining letters: C, H, K, P, V, W, Y, U

Possible 5-letter words fitting B L _ O _:
- BLOWN – N eliminated  
- BLOOM – M eliminated  
- BLOKE – K is allowed, E eliminated  
- BLOCH – H is allowed, C is allowed  
- BLOKE – K is allowed, E eliminated  
- BLOCH – C, H allowed  
- BLOWS – S eliminated  
- BLOKY – Y is allowed  
- BLOVK – not a word  
- BLOCH – valid word  
- BLOKE – valid word but E eliminated  
- BLOKY – valid word  

From these, the valid candidates are:
- BLOCH  
- BLOKY  

Both fit the pattern and use allowed letters.  
Between them, ""BLOCH"" is more common.  

Therefore, my next guess is ""BLOCH"".
