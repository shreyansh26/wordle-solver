### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers as many frequently occurring letters in English as possible. This will help maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us coverage of 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (S, L, T), which should provide good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

This will help maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. \n\nLooking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- T (very common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis combination gives us coverage of 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (S, L, T), which should provide good information about which letters are present in the secret word.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S: not in the word (x)\n- L: not in the word (x)\n- A: in the word but wrong position (-)\n- T: in the word but wrong position (-)\n- E: not in the word (x)\n\nSo we know:\n1.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x): S, L, E, I, N, C  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions (-): A, R, O  
Letters that ARE in the word AND in the correct positions (✓): T in position 1, R in position 3  

So far:
- Position 1: T (✓)
- Position 3: R (✓)
- We still need to place A and O somewhere in positions 2, 4, 5, but not where they were before:
  – A was in positions 2, 3, 4 (all wrong) ⇒ A must be in 5
  – O was in position 4 (wrong) ⇒ O must be in 2 or 5
- However, A must be in 5 (only remaining spot), so O must be in 2 or 4. But O was in 4 and was marked wrong, so O must be in 2.
- Position 4 is still open and must be filled by a letter we haven’t tried yet (and not any of the eliminated letters).

So the skeleton so far is: T O R _ A

We need a letter for position 4 that hasn’t been used or eliminated. Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A common word that fits is “TORPA” (though it’s less common), but a better, more common word is “TROOP” – but O is already used. Another option is “TROCK” – but C is eliminated. “TRODE” – E is eliminated. “TROKA” – not a word. 

A valid common word is “TROOP”, but O is already in position 2. Let me think of another. “TROCK” is invalid (C). “TROVE” – E is out. “TRODE” – E is out. “TROAK” – not valid. 

Actually, let’s list the letters we have used: T, A, R, O, C, S, L, E, I, N. Eliminated letters: S, L, E, I, N, C. Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

The pattern is T O R _ A. The blank must be a new letter. Let’s try “TROKA” – invalid. “TROPA” – not a word. “TRODE” – E out. “TROCK” – C out. 

A valid word is “TROOP” – but O is already in position 2. Let me think differently. Maybe the word is “TROAK” – but that’s not valid. 

Actually, let me check again: the pattern is T O R _ A. The blank must be a letter we haven’t used. Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A valid word is “TROPA” – but P is allowed. However, “TROPA” is not a common English word. A better word is “TROVE” – but E is eliminated. 

Wait, let me think of “TROCK” – but C is eliminated. 

Actually, let me list all possible valid English words matching T O R _ A:

- T O R P A – TORPA (not a common word)
- T O R B A – TORBA (not a word)
- T O R D A – TORDA (not a word)
- T O R F A – TORFA (not a word)
- T O R G A – TORGA (not a word)
- T O R H A – TORHA (not a word)
- T O R K A – TORKA (not a word)
- T O R M A – TORMA (not a word)
- T O R P A – same as TORPA
- T O R U A – TORUA (not a word)
- T O R V A – TORVA (not a word)
- T O R W A – TORWA (not a word)
- T O R Y A – TORAY (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let me reconsider the placement. Maybe A is not in position 5. Let me re-examine:

From Guess 3 (TAROC) feedback:
- T(✓) position 1
- A(-) – A is in word but wrong position (was in 2, now 3,4,5 – all wrong)
- R(✓) position 3
- O(-) – O is in word but wrong position (was in 4, now 2,3,5 – all wrong)
- C(x) – C not in word

So positions:
1: T
2: ?
3: R
4: ?
5: ?

Letters in word: T, R, A, O
Letters not in word: S, L, E, I, N, C

A must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (positions 3 and 1 are taken by R and T)
O must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (positions 1 and 3 are taken by T and R)

Possible combinations:
- A in 2: T A R _ _
- O in 4: T _ R O _
- A in 5: T _ R _ A
- O in 5: T _ R _ O

Let’s try A in 2: T A R _ _
Then O must be in 4 or 5:
- T A R O _ – but O was in 4 and marked wrong, so 4 is invalid
- T A R _ O – possible, but O in 5 is allowed
We need a letter for position 4: must be new, not eliminated
Possible: T A R B O – TARBO (not a word)
T A R D O – TARDO (not a word)
T A R F O – TARFO (not a word)
T A R G O – TARGO (not a word)

T A R U O – TARUO (not a word)
T A R V O – TARVO (not a word)
T A R W O – TARWO (not a word)
T A R Y O – TARYO (not a word)

None of these are valid. Let’s try A in 5: T _ R _ A
Then O must be in 2 or 4:
- O in 2: T O R _ A – need letter for 4: new, not eliminated
Possible: T O R B A – TORBA (not a word)

T O R V A – TORVA (not a word)
T O R W A – TORWA (not a word)
T O R Y A – TORAY (not a word)

Still no valid word. Let’s try O in 5: T _ R _ O
Then A must be in 2 or 4:
- A in 2: T A R _ O – need letter for 4: new, not eliminated
Possible: T A R B O – TARBO (not a word)
T A R D A – but A is already in 2

No valid words. Let’s try A in 4: T _ R A _
Then O must be in 2 or 5:
- O in 2: T O R A _ – need letter for 5: new, not eliminated
Possible: T O R A B – TORAB (not a word)

T O R A V – TORAV (not a word)
T O R A W – TORAW (not a word)
T O R A Y – TORAY (not a word)

“TORAH” is a valid English word meaning the Jewish scriptures. It fits all constraints:
- T(✓) position 1
- O in position 2 (new)
- R(✓) position 3
- A in position 4 (new)
- H new, not eliminated

Therefore, the next guess should be TORAH.

From the feedback so far:
- Position 1: T (correct)
- Position 3: R (correct)
- Letters still in play: A, O
- Letters eliminated: S, L, E, I, N, C
- A must be in position 4 (only remaining spot)

- Position 5 must be a new letter not yet used or eliminated

The only valid word fitting this pattern is ""TORAH"".
