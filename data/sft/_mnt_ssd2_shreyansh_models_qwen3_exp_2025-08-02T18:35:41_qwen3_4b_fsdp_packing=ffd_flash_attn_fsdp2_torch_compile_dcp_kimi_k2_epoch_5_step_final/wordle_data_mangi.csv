For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:

1. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N
2. Common vowels like A, E, I, O
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- High frequency letters in English words

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to work with for subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

Next, we want a word that:
- Has A somewhere other than the first position.
- Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, U (since A is already confirmed and O/E are ruled out).

A strong candidate is “AUDIO”:
- Contains A (and places it in position 2, which is different from the first position).
- Uses I and U, two other common vowels.
- Uses D and T, common consonants.
- No R, O, S, E.

This should help us quickly narrow down the remaining possibilities.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:

1. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N
2. Common vowels like A, E, I, O
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- High frequency letters in English words

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to work with for subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

Next, we want a word that:
- Has A somewhere other than the first position.
- Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, U (since A is already confirmed and O/E are ruled out).

A strong candidate is “AUDIO”:
- Contains A (and places it in position 2, which is different from the first position).
- Uses I and U, two other common vowels.
- Uses D and T, common consonants.
- No R, O, S, E.

This should help us quickly narrow down the remaining possibilities.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.

   - U and D are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - O is not in the word (confirmed again).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, U, D
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, I
- Position constraints:
  – A is not in position 1.
  – I is not in position 4.

Remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Remaining common vowels: A (known), I (known), possibly Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and I.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, U, D.
- Places A somewhere other than position 1.
- Places I somewhere other than position 4.

A good candidate is “CHAIN”:

Let’s consolidate everything we know after four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x in any position):
R, O, S, E, U, D, C, H, P, T

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or – in any position):
A, I, N

Exact positional constraints from the last feedback (pinta):
- P(x) → P not in word (already known)
- I(-) → I is in the word but NOT in position 2
- N(✓) → N is in the word AND in position 3
- T(x) → T not in word (already known)
- A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 5

So far:
- Position 3 is N.
- A is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5 → A must be in position 2 or 4.
- I is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → I must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But position 3 is already N, so I must be in position 1 or 5.
- We still need to place A and I in the remaining spots, using only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ A N _ _  (A in 2)
  - I must go in 1 or 5
  - If I in 1: I A N _ _
  - If I in 5: _ A N _ I

- _ _ N A _  (A in 4)
  - I must go in 1 or 5
  - If I in 1: I _ N A _
  - If I in 5: _ _ N A I

We also need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not yet ruled out: allowed consonants include B, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try the pattern I A N _ _:
- I A N _ _
- Need two more consonants, not yet used and not forbidden.
- Common remaining consonants: B, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y
- Let’s pick B and K → I A N B K
  - Check letters: I, A, N, B, K – none are forbidden.
  - Check positions: A is in 2 (allowed), I is in 1 (allowed), N is in 3 (correct), B and K are new and allowed.

This seems valid. Let’s verify:
- I A N B K
- P: not in word (ok)
- A: in word, not in 1,3,5 → position 2 (ok)
- N: in word, position 3 (correct)
- B: new, allowed

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:

1. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N
2. Common vowels like A, E, I, O
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

A popular and effective starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- High frequency letters in English words

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to work with for subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

Next, we want a word that:
- Has A somewhere other than the first position.
- Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, U (since A is already confirmed and O/E are ruled out).

A strong candidate is “AUDIO”:
- Contains A (and places it in position 2, which is different from the first position).
- Uses I and U, two other common vowels.
- Uses D and T, common consonants.
- No R, O, S, E.

This should help us quickly narrow down the remaining possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(-) O(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. audio → A(-) U(x) D(x) I(-) O(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1 (confirmed again).
   - U and D are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - O is not in the word (confirmed again).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, U, D
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, I
- Position constraints:
  – A is not in position 1.
  – I is not in position 4.

Remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Remaining common vowels: A (known), I (known), possibly Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and I.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, U, D.
- Places A somewhere other than position 1.
- Places I somewhere other than position 4.

A good candidate is “CHAIN”:
- C, H, N are new consonants to test.
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- I is in position 2 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

Let’s try it.

Guess 3: chain -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(-) I(-) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on “chain”:

- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- H(x) → H is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 4.
- N(-) → N is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of all constraints so far:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, U, D, C, H  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, I, N  
Position constraints:
- A ≠ 1, 3  
- I ≠ 4  
- N ≠ 5  

Remaining common letters to try: T, L, M, P, B, G, K, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, I, N.
2. Places A in position 2 or 4 or 5 (but not 1 or 3).
3. Places I in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).
4. Places N in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).
5. Uses only letters not ruled out.

Let’s test “PLAIN”:
- P, L are new consonants.
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- I in position 3 (allowed).
- N in position 5 → but N cannot be in position 5 (from feedback). So N would be in position 5 here, which is invalid.

Next candidate: “PLAIN” fails because N is in position 5.

Try “PINTA”:
- P, T are new consonants.
- I in position 1 (allowed).
- N in position 2 (allowed).
- T in position 3 (new).
- A in position 5 (allowed).
- Letters: P, I, N, T, A — none of the forbidden letters (R, O, S, E, U, D, C, H) appear.

This satisfies all constraints.

So we’ll guess “PINTA”.

Let’s consolidate everything we know after four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x in any position):
R, O, S, E, U, D, C, H, P, T

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or – in any position):
A, I, N

Exact positional constraints from the last feedback (pinta):
- P(x) → P not in word (already known)
- I(-) → I is in the word but NOT in position 2
- N(✓) → N is in the word AND in position 3
- T(x) → T not in word (already known)
- A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 5

So far:
- Position 3 is N.
- A is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5 → A must be in position 2 or 4.
- I is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 4 → I must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But position 3 is already N, so I must be in position 1 or 5.
- We still need to place A and I in the remaining spots, using only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ A N _ _  (A in 2)
  - I must go in 1 or 5
  - If I in 1: I A N _ _
  - If I in 5: _ A N _ I

- _ _ N A _  (A in 4)
  - I must go in 1 or 5
  - If I in 1: I _ N A _
  - If I in 5: _ _ N A I

We also need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not yet ruled out: allowed consonants include B, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try the pattern I A N _ _:
- I A N _ _
- Need two more consonants, not yet used and not forbidden.
- Common remaining consonants: B, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y
- Let’s pick B and K → I A N B K
  - Check letters: I, A, N, B, K – none are forbidden.
  - Check positions: A is in 2 (allowed), I is in 1 (allowed), N is in 3 (correct), B and K are new and allowed.

This seems valid. Let’s verify:
- I A N B K
- P: not in word (ok)
- A: in word, not in 1,3,5 → position 2 (ok)
- N: in word, position 3 (correct)
- B: new, allowed
- K: new, allowed

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is IANBK.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after five guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x in any position):
R, O, S, E, U, D, C, H, P, T, B, K

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or – in any position):
A, I, N

Exact positional constraints from the last feedback (ianbk):
- I(-) → I is in the word but NOT in position 1
- A(✓) → A is in the word AND in position 2
- N(✓) → N is in the word AND in position 3
- B(x) → B not in word (already known)
- K(x) → K not in word (already known)

So the word must look like:
_ A N _ _

With the following constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be I (from ianbk feedback), and cannot be any of the forbidden letters.
- Position 4: cannot be any of the forbidden letters.
- Position 5: cannot be any of the forbidden letters.

Allowed letters left (not yet ruled out):
Consonants: F, G, J, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: only A and I are confirmed; O, U, E are out; Y can act as vowel.

But we already have A in position 2 and N in position 3, so positions 1, 4, 5 must be filled with the remaining allowed consonants or Y.

We also know I must appear somewhere (from earlier feedback), and it cannot be in position 1 or 4 (from previous constraints). Therefore I must be in position 5.

So the word must be:
_ A N _ I

Now we just need to fill position 1 and position 4 with allowed consonants (not B, K, etc.).

Possible consonants left: F, G, J, L, M, Q, V, W, Y, Z

Let’s try common combinations:
- F A N D I → D is forbidden
- F A N G I → G is allowed
- F A N K I → K is forbidden
- F A N L I → L is allowed
- G A N G I → G is allowed
- L A N D I → D is forbidden
- L A N G I → G is allowed
- M A N G I → G is allowed
- V A N G I → G is allowed
- W A N G I → G is allowed
- Y A N G I → G is allowed

Among these, “FANGI”, “LANGI”, “MANGI”, “VANGI”, “WANGI”, “YANGI” are all possible. However, “FANGI” is a valid English word (a type of fungus), while the others are less common or not standard.

Therefore, the most likely candidate is “FANGI”.

Letters NOT in the word (x in any position):
R, O, S, E, U, D, C, H, P, T, B, K

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or – in any position):
A, I, N

Exact positional constraints from the last feedback (ianbk):
- I(-) → I is in the word but NOT in position 1
- A(✓) → A is in the word AND in position 2
- N(✓) → N is in the word AND in position 3
- B(x) → B not in word (already known)

So the word must look like:

With the following constraints:
- Position 1: cannot be I (from ianbk feedback), and cannot be any of the forbidden letters.
- Position 4: cannot be any of the forbidden letters.
- Position 5: cannot be any of the forbidden letters.

Allowed letters left (not yet ruled out):
Consonants: F, G, J, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: only A and I are confirmed; O, U, E are out; Y can act as vowel.

But we already have A in position 2 and N in position 3, so positions 1, 4, 5 must be filled with the remaining allowed consonants or Y.

We also know I must appear somewhere (from earlier feedback), and it cannot be in position 1 or 4 (from previous constraints). Therefore I must be in position 5.

So the word must be:
_ A N _ I

Now we just need to fill position 1 and position 4 with allowed consonants (not B, K, etc.).

Possible consonants left: F, G, J, L, M, Q, V, W, Y, Z

Let’s try common combinations:
- F A N D I → D is forbidden
- F A N G I → G is allowed
- F A N K I → K is forbidden
- F A N L I → L is allowed
- G A N G I → G is allowed
