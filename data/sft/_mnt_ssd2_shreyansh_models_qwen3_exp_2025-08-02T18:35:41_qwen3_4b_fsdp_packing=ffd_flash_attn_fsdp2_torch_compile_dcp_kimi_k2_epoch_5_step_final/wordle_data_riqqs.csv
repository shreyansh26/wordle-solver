For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us coverage of 5 of the 10 most common letters in English, which should provide good information about what letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- R and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, O, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes R and S (but R not in position 2 and S not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Possible candidates:
- R and S must be placed in different positions. Let's try to place R in position 1 (since it can't be in 2) and S in position 3 (since it can't be in 4).
- Fill the remaining slots with common letters that haven't been ruled out.

A word that fits: ""RUSTY""
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R can't be in 2).
- S is not in the word at all (but we know S is in the word, so this is bad).

Let's try ""FRISK"":
- F, R, I, S, K
- R is in position 2 (but R can't be in 2), so this is invalid.

Try ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, S, P
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""DRIPS"":
- D, R, I, P, S
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""TRISK"":
- T, R, I, S, K
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""GRIST"":
- G, R, I, S, T
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""PRISM"":
- P, R, I, S, M
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""RISKS"":
- R in position 1 (allowed), S in position 4 (invalid, since S can't be in 4).

Try ""RUSTY"" is invalid because S is not present. Let's try ""RUSTY"" is invalid.

Wait, we need S in the word but not in position 4. Let's try ""URSIN"" (but this is not a valid word).

Let's try ""CRUST"":
- C, R, U, S, T
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Let's try ""BRISK"":
- B, R, I, S, K
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Let's try ""DRIPS"" again - R is in position 2.

Let's try ""GRIST"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""PRISM"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""TRISK"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""CRISP"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""FRISK"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""RUSTY"" - S is not present.

Let's try ""RISKS"" - S in position 5 (valid), R in position 1 (valid).

""RISKS"" is a valid word:
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R can't be in 2).
- S in position 4 (invalid, since S can't be in 4).

Wait, S is in position 4 here, which is invalid.

Let's try ""RISKS"" - S is in position 5, which is allowed.

""RISKS"":
- R in position 1 (valid, since R can't be in 2).
- S in position 5 (valid, since S can't be in 4).
- Contains R and S.
- Excludes A, O, E.
- Uses I, K, which are new letters.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""CRISP"" - but R is in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""FRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""GRIST"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""PRISM"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""BRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Let's try ""RISKS"" as it seems to fit.

But let's check if there's a better word.

Alternative approach: place R in position 3 and S in position 1.

Word: ""S R _ _ _"" but R is in position 3.

""SR..."" is not common.

Let's try ""RISKS"" again - seems to be the best valid word fitting constraints.

But ""RISKS"" has S in position 5, which is allowed.

Therefore, ""RISKS"" is a valid next guess.

Based on the feedback that R and S are in the word but in wrong positions, and A, O, E are not present, I'll try a word that places R and S in new positions while introducing fresh letters.

From the new feedback on RISKS:

1. R(✓) – R is in the word AND in the correct position (position 1).
2. I(✓) – I is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
3. S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
4. K(x) – K is NOT in the word.
5. S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know:
- The word starts with R, has I in position 2, and ends with S.
- It must contain an additional S somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since S is in the word but not in position 3, the only remaining place is position 4).
- Letters already ruled out: A, O, E, K.
- Remaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Putting this together, the pattern is:
R I _ S with an S in position 4, making it R I S S ? — but that would be 5 letters, so actually:
R I _ _ S with an S in position 4, so the word must be R I S _ S. Wait, that would be 5 letters: R I S _ S.

But that would require position 4 to be S, but the feedback says S is in position 5. Let me re-examine:

The word is R I _ _ S (positions 1-5). From the feedback on RISKS:
- Position 1: R(✓) – correct.
- Position 2: I(✓) – correct.
- Position 3: S(-) – S is in the word but not here.
- Position 4: K(x) – K not here.
- Position 5: S(✓) – S is here.

So the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be another S in position 3 or 4. But position 3 is marked as ""S(-)"" meaning S is not in position 3, so the S must be in position 4. But position 4 is K(x), so that can't be. This seems contradictory.

Wait, no – the feedback for RISKS is:
R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)
This means:
- R is correct in position 1.
- I is correct in position 2.
- S in position 3 is in the word but wrong position (so S must be elsewhere).
- K is not in the word.
- S in position 5 is correct.

Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be an S in position 3 or 4, but position 3 is marked as S(-), so S must be in position 4. But position 4 is K(x), which is not S. This suggests the word must be R I S _ S, but that would be 5 letters: R I S _ S. However, position 4 would then be the missing letter, and position 5 is S. This seems possible.

But looking at common words, ""RISUS"" comes to mind (a medical term), but U is allowed. Alternatively, ""RISPS"" but P is allowed. However, ""RISPS"" has P in position 4 and S in 5. But we know S is in position 5, and we need an S in position 3 or 4. Since position 3 is marked as S(-), the S must be in position 4, but position 4 is K(x) in RISKS. This seems conflicting.

Wait, the feedback for RISKS is:
R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)
This means:
- R is correct in position 1.
- I is correct in position 2.
- The S in position 3 is in the word but wrong position (so S must be in position 4 or 5).
- K is not in the word.
- The S in position 5 is correct.

Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be an S in position 4 (since position 3's S is wrong position and position 5 is correct). So the word must be R I S _ S, but that would require position 4 to be S, making it R I S S S, which is 5 letters. But that seems unlikely.

This suggests the word must be R I S _ S, but position 4 would need to be S, making it R I S S S, which is not a common word. This seems like a contradiction, indicating I might have misinterpreted.

Re-reading the feedback:
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 1.
- I(✓) – I is correct in position 2.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.
- K(x) – K is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 5.

Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be an S in position 3 or 4 (since S is in the word but not in position 3, it must be in position 4). So the word is R I _ S S. But that would be R I _ S S, which is 5 letters. The missing letter in position 3 must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Possible words:
- R I N S S – ""RINSS"" – not valid.
- R I D S S – ""RIDD S"" – no.
- R I P S S – ""RIPSS"" – no.
- R I B S S – ""RIBSS"" – no.
- R I C S S – ""RICSS"" – no.
- R I V S S – ""RIVSS"" – no.
- R I L S S – ""RILSS"" – no.

This seems problematic. Perhaps the word has only one S in position 5, and the S in position 3 was just indicating S is in the word but not in position 3, which is already satisfied by S in position 5. Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S with no additional S needed, and the S in position 3 was just confirming S is in the word but not in position 3 (which is already the case since S is in position 5).

Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and we need to find a consonant for position 3 and 4. Common words:
- R I V E S – but E is ruled out.
- R I V A L – but A is ruled out.
- R I V U S – U is allowed, but is this a word?
- R I V U S – ""RIVUS"" – not common.
- R I V E R – E is ruled out.
- R I V A L – A is ruled out.
- R I V U S – seems obscure.

Another approach: since S is only confirmed in position 5, and we need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet used and not ruled out. Ruled out letters: A, O, E, K. So possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- R I V E S – E ruled out.
- R I V U S – U is allowed, but is this a word? ""RIVUS"" is not standard.
- R I V A L – A ruled out.
- R I V A L – same.
- R I V E R – E ruled out.
- R I V A N – A ruled out.
- R I V U S – not standard.
- R I V U S – no.

Wait, perhaps ""RIVUS"" is acceptable as a variant. Alternatively, ""RIVUS"" might not be. Let me think of other combinations.

Another candidate: R I V E N – E ruled out.
R I V E N – same.
R I V U S – no.

Another candidate: R I V A L – A ruled out.
R I V A N – A ruled out.
R I V E N – E ruled out.
R I V E S – E ruled out.

This seems difficult. Let me try with different consonants.

R I N G S – G is allowed, but this has S in position 5, and we need to check if S is in position 3. In RINGS, S is in position 5, and position 3 is G, so this would fit:
- R(✓) I(✓) N _ G S – but position 3 is G, position 4 is S? No, RINGS is R-I-N-G-S.

Wait, R I N G S is R(1) I(2) N(3) G(4) S(5). From feedback:
- R(✓) – correct.
- I(✓) – correct.
- N(3) – not tested yet.
- G(4) – not tested yet.
- S(5) – correct.

But we know S is in the word but not in position 3, which is satisfied since S is in position 5. This seems valid. However, we need to check if this uses any ruled-out letters. Ruled-out letters: A, O, E, K. RINGS uses R, I, N, G, S – none of which are ruled out, and it fits the pattern.

Therefore, ""RINGS"" is a valid next guess.
</think>

From the feedback:
- R is correct in position 1.
- I is correct in position 2.
- S is correct in position 5.
- S is in the word but not in position 3 (so the only remaining place for the second S is position 4, but position 4 is K(x) in RISKS, which is not S). This suggests the word has only one S in position 5, and the earlier S in position 3 was just confirming S is in the word but not in position 3 (which is already satisfied).

Thus, the word is R I _ _ S with positions 3 and 4 to be determined. A common word fitting this is ""RINGS"" (R-I-N-G-S).

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us coverage of 5 of the 10 most common letters in English, which should provide good information about what letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- R and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, O, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes R and S (but R not in position 2 and S not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Possible candidates:
- R and S must be placed in different positions. Let's try to place R in position 1 (since it can't be in 2) and S in position 3 (since it can't be in 4).
- Fill the remaining slots with common letters that haven't been ruled out.

A word that fits: ""RUSTY""
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R can't be in 2).
- S is not in the word at all (but we know S is in the word, so this is bad).

Let's try ""FRISK"":
- F, R, I, S, K
- R is in position 2 (but R can't be in 2), so this is invalid.

Try ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, S, P
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""DRIPS"":
- D, R, I, P, S
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""TRISK"":
- T, R, I, S, K
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""GRIST"":
- G, R, I, S, T
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""PRISM"":
- P, R, I, S, M
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""RISKS"":
- R in position 1 (allowed), S in position 4 (invalid, since S can't be in 4).

Try ""RUSTY"" is invalid because S is not present. Let's try ""RUSTY"" is invalid.

Wait, we need S in the word but not in position 4. Let's try ""URSIN"" (but this is not a valid word).

Let's try ""CRUST"":
- C, R, U, S, T
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Let's try ""BRISK"":
- B, R, I, S, K
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Let's try ""DRIPS"" again - R is in position 2.

Let's try ""GRIST"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""PRISM"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""TRISK"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""CRISP"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""FRISK"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""RUSTY"" - S is not present.

Let's try ""RISKS"" - S in position 5 (valid), R in position 1 (valid).

""RISKS"" is a valid word:
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R can't be in 2).
- S in position 4 (invalid, since S can't be in 4).

Wait, S is in position 4 here, which is invalid.

Let's try ""RISKS"" - S is in position 5, which is allowed.

""RISKS"":
- R in position 1 (valid, since R can't be in 2).
- S in position 5 (valid, since S can't be in 4).
- Contains R and S.
- Excludes A, O, E.
- Uses I, K, which are new letters.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""CRISP"" - but R is in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""FRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""GRIST"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""PRISM"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""TRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""BRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Let's try ""RISKS"" as it seems to fit.

But let's check if there's a better word.

Alternative approach: place R in position 3 and S in position 1.

Word: ""S R _ _ _"" but R is in position 3.

""SR..."" is not common.

Let's try ""RISKS"" again - seems to be the best valid word fitting constraints.

But ""RISKS"" has S in position 5, which is allowed.

Therefore, ""RISKS"" is a valid next guess.Based on the feedback that R and S are in the word but in wrong positions, and A, O, E are not present, I'll try a word that places R and S in new positions while introducing fresh letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: RISKS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RISKS:

1. R(✓) – R is in the word AND in the correct position (position 1).
2. I(✓) – I is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
3. S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
4. K(x) – K is NOT in the word.
5. S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know:
- The word starts with R, has I in position 2, and ends with S.
- It must contain an additional S somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since S is in the word but not in position 3, the only remaining place is position 4).
- Letters already ruled out: A, O, E, K.
- Remaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Putting this together, the pattern is:
R I _ S with an S in position 4, making it R I S S ? — but that would be 5 letters, so actually:
R I _ _ S with an S in position 4, so the word must be R I S _ S. Wait, that would be 5 letters: R I S _ S.

But that would require position 4 to be S, but the feedback says S is in position 5. Let me re-examine:

The word is R I _ _ S (positions 1-5). From the feedback on RISKS:
- Position 1: R(✓) – correct.
- Position 2: I(✓) – correct.
- Position 3: S(-) – S is in the word but not here.
- Position 4: K(x) – K not here.
- Position 5: S(✓) – S is here.

So the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be another S in position 3 or 4. But position 3 is marked as ""S(-)"" meaning S is not in position 3, so the S must be in position 4. But position 4 is K(x), so that can't be. This seems contradictory.

Wait, no – the feedback for RISKS is:
R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)
This means:
- R is correct in position 1.
- I is correct in position 2.
- S in position 3 is in the word but wrong position (so S must be elsewhere).
- K is not in the word.
- S in position 5 is correct.

Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be an S in position 3 or 4, but position 3 is marked as S(-), so S must be in position 4. But position 4 is K(x), which is not S. This suggests the word must be R I S _ S, but that would be 5 letters: R I S _ S. However, position 4 would then be the missing letter, and position 5 is S. This seems possible.

But looking at common words, ""RISUS"" comes to mind (a medical term), but U is allowed. Alternatively, ""RISPS"" but P is allowed. However, ""RISPS"" has P in position 4 and S in 5. But we know S is in position 5, and we need an S in position 3 or 4. Since position 3 is marked as S(-), the S must be in position 4, but position 4 is K(x) in RISKS. This seems conflicting.

Wait, the feedback for RISKS is:
R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)
This means:
- R is correct in position 1.
- I is correct in position 2.
- The S in position 3 is in the word but wrong position (so S must be in position 4 or 5).
- K is not in the word.
- The S in position 5 is correct.

Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be an S in position 4 (since position 3's S is wrong position and position 5 is correct). So the word must be R I S _ S, but that would require position 4 to be S, making it R I S S S, which is 5 letters. But that seems unlikely.

This suggests the word must be R I S _ S, but position 4 would need to be S, making it R I S S S, which is not a common word. This seems like a contradiction, indicating I might have misinterpreted.

Re-reading the feedback:
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 1.
- I(✓) – I is correct in position 2.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.
- K(x) – K is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 5.

Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be an S in position 3 or 4 (since S is in the word but not in position 3, it must be in position 4). So the word is R I _ S S. But that would be R I _ S S, which is 5 letters. The missing letter in position 3 must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Possible words:
- R I N S S – ""RINSS"" – not valid.
- R I D S S – ""RIDD S"" – no.
- R I P S S – ""RIPSS"" – no.
- R I B S S – ""RIBSS"" – no.
- R I C S S – ""RICSS"" – no.
- R I V S S – ""RIVSS"" – no.
- R I L S S – ""RILSS"" – no.

This seems problematic. Perhaps the word has only one S in position 5, and the S in position 3 was just indicating S is in the word but not in position 3, which is already satisfied by S in position 5. Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S with no additional S needed, and the S in position 3 was just confirming S is in the word but not in position 3 (which is already the case since S is in position 5).

Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and we need to find a consonant for position 3 and 4. Common words:
- R I V E S – but E is ruled out.
- R I V A L – but A is ruled out.
- R I V U S – U is allowed, but is this a word?
- R I V U S – ""RIVUS"" – not common.
- R I V E R – E is ruled out.
- R I V A L – A is ruled out.
- R I V U S – seems obscure.

Another approach: since S is only confirmed in position 5, and we need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet used and not ruled out. Ruled out letters: A, O, E, K. So possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- R I V E S – E ruled out.
- R I V U S – U is allowed, but is this a word? ""RIVUS"" is not standard.
- R I V A L – A ruled out.
- R I V A L – same.
- R I V E R – E ruled out.
- R I V A N – A ruled out.
- R I V U S – not standard.
- R I V U S – no.

Wait, perhaps ""RIVUS"" is acceptable as a variant. Alternatively, ""RIVUS"" might not be. Let me think of other combinations.

Another candidate: R I V E N – E ruled out.
R I V E N – same.
R I V U S – no.

Another candidate: R I V A L – A ruled out.
R I V A N – A ruled out.
R I V E N – E ruled out.
R I V E S – E ruled out.

This seems difficult. Let me try with different consonants.

R I N G S – G is allowed, but this has S in position 5, and we need to check if S is in position 3. In RINGS, S is in position 5, and position 3 is G, so this would fit:
- R(✓) I(✓) N _ G S – but position 3 is G, position 4 is S? No, RINGS is R-I-N-G-S.

Wait, R I N G S is R(1) I(2) N(3) G(4) S(5). From feedback:
- R(✓) – correct.
- I(✓) – correct.
- N(3) – not tested yet.
- G(4) – not tested yet.
- S(5) – correct.

But we know S is in the word but not in position 3, which is satisfied since S is in position 5. This seems valid. However, we need to check if this uses any ruled-out letters. Ruled-out letters: A, O, E, K. RINGS uses R, I, N, G, S – none of which are ruled out, and it fits the pattern.

Therefore, ""RINGS"" is a valid next guess.From the feedback:
- R is correct in position 1.
- I is correct in position 2.
- S is correct in position 5.
- S is in the word but not in position 3 (so the only remaining place for the second S is position 4, but position 4 is K(x) in RISKS, which is not S). This suggests the word has only one S in position 5, and the earlier S in position 3 was just confirming S is in the word but not in position 3 (which is already satisfied).

Thus, the word is R I _ _ S with positions 3 and 4 to be determined. A common word fitting this is ""RINGS"" (R-I-N-G-S).

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us coverage of 5 of the 10 most common letters in English, which should provide good information about what letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- R and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, O, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes R and S (but R not in position 2 and S not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Possible candidates:
- R and S must be placed in different positions. Let's try to place R in position 1 (since it can't be in 2) and S in position 3 (since it can't be in 4).
- Fill the remaining slots with common letters that haven't been ruled out.

A word that fits: ""RUSTY""
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R can't be in 2).
- S is not in the word at all (but we know S is in the word, so this is bad).

Let's try ""FRISK"":
- F, R, I, S, K
- R is in position 2 (but R can't be in 2), so this is invalid.

Try ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, S, P
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""DRIPS"":
- D, R, I, P, S
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""TRISK"":
- T, R, I, S, K
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""GRIST"":
- G, R, I, S, T
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""PRISM"":
- P, R, I, S, M
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""RISKS"":
- R in position 1 (allowed), S in position 4 (invalid, since S can't be in 4).

Try ""RUSTY"" is invalid because S is not present. Let's try ""RUSTY"" is invalid.

Wait, we need S in the word but not in position 4. Let's try ""URSIN"" (but this is not a valid word).

Let's try ""CRUST"":
- C, R, U, S, T
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Let's try ""BRISK"":
- B, R, I, S, K
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Let's try ""DRIPS"" again - R is in position 2.

Let's try ""GRIST"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""PRISM"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""TRISK"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""CRISP"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""FRISK"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""RUSTY"" - S is not present.

Let's try ""RISKS"" - S in position 5 (valid), R in position 1 (valid).

""RISKS"" is a valid word:
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R can't be in 2).
- S in position 4 (invalid, since S can't be in 4).

Wait, S is in position 4 here, which is invalid.

Let's try ""RISKS"" - S is in position 5, which is allowed.

""RISKS"":
- R in position 1 (valid, since R can't be in 2).
- S in position 5 (valid, since S can't be in 4).
- Contains R and S.
- Excludes A, O, E.
- Uses I, K, which are new letters.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""CRISP"" - but R is in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""FRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""GRIST"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""PRISM"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""TRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""BRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Let's try ""RISKS"" as it seems to fit.

But let's check if there's a better word.

Alternative approach: place R in position 3 and S in position 1.

Word: ""S R _ _ _"" but R is in position 3.

""SR..."" is not common.

Let's try ""RISKS"" again - seems to be the best valid word fitting constraints.

But ""RISKS"" has S in position 5, which is allowed.

Therefore, ""RISKS"" is a valid next guess.Based on the feedback that R and S are in the word but in wrong positions, and A, O, E are not present, I'll try a word that places R and S in new positions while introducing fresh letters.

<guess>RISKS</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: RISKS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RISKS:

1. R(✓) – R is in the word AND in the correct position (position 1).
2. I(✓) – I is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
3. S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
4. K(x) – K is NOT in the word.
5. S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know:
- The word starts with R, has I in position 2, and ends with S.
- It must contain an additional S somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since S is in the word but not in position 3, the only remaining place is position 4).
- Letters already ruled out: A, O, E, K.
- Remaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Putting this together, the pattern is:
R I _ S with an S in position 4, making it R I S S ? — but that would be 5 letters, so actually:
R I _ _ S with an S in position 4, so the word must be R I S _ S. Wait, that would be 5 letters: R I S _ S.

But that would require position 4 to be S, but the feedback says S is in position 5. Let me re-examine:

The word is R I _ _ S (positions 1-5). From the feedback on RISKS:
- Position 1: R(✓) – correct.
- Position 2: I(✓) – correct.
- Position 3: S(-) – S is in the word but not here.
- Position 4: K(x) – K not here.
- Position 5: S(✓) – S is here.

So the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be another S in position 3 or 4. But position 3 is marked as ""S(-)"" meaning S is not in position 3, so the S must be in position 4. But position 4 is K(x), so that can't be. This seems contradictory.

Wait, no – the feedback for RISKS is:
R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)
This means:
- R is correct in position 1.
- I is correct in position 2.
- S in position 3 is in the word but wrong position (so S must be elsewhere).
- K is not in the word.
- S in position 5 is correct.

Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be an S in position 3 or 4, but position 3 is marked as S(-), so S must be in position 4. But position 4 is K(x), which is not S. This suggests the word must be R I S _ S, but that would be 5 letters: R I S _ S. However, position 4 would then be the missing letter, and position 5 is S. This seems possible.

But looking at common words, ""RISUS"" comes to mind (a medical term), but U is allowed. Alternatively, ""RISPS"" but P is allowed. However, ""RISPS"" has P in position 4 and S in 5. But we know S is in position 5, and we need an S in position 3 or 4. Since position 3 is marked as S(-), the S must be in position 4, but position 4 is K(x) in RISKS. This seems conflicting.

Wait, the feedback for RISKS is:
R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)
This means:
- R is correct in position 1.
- I is correct in position 2.
- The S in position 3 is in the word but wrong position (so S must be in position 4 or 5).
- K is not in the word.
- The S in position 5 is correct.

Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be an S in position 4 (since position 3's S is wrong position and position 5 is correct). So the word must be R I S _ S, but that would require position 4 to be S, making it R I S S S, which is 5 letters. But that seems unlikely.

This suggests the word must be R I S _ S, but position 4 would need to be S, making it R I S S S, which is not a common word. This seems like a contradiction, indicating I might have misinterpreted.

Re-reading the feedback:
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 1.
- I(✓) – I is correct in position 2.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.
- K(x) – K is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 5.

Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be an S in position 3 or 4 (since S is in the word but not in position 3, it must be in position 4). So the word is R I _ S S. But that would be R I _ S S, which is 5 letters. The missing letter in position 3 must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Possible words:
- R I N S S – ""RINSS"" – not valid.
- R I D S S – ""RIDD S"" – no.
- R I P S S – ""RIPSS"" – no.
- R I B S S – ""RIBSS"" – no.
- R I C S S – ""RICSS"" – no.
- R I V S S – ""RIVSS"" – no.
- R I L S S – ""RILSS"" – no.

This seems problematic. Perhaps the word has only one S in position 5, and the S in position 3 was just indicating S is in the word but not in position 3, which is already satisfied by S in position 5. Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S with no additional S needed, and the S in position 3 was just confirming S is in the word but not in position 3 (which is already the case since S is in position 5).

Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and we need to find a consonant for position 3 and 4. Common words:
- R I V E S – but E is ruled out.
- R I V A L – but A is ruled out.
- R I V U S – U is allowed, but is this a word?
- R I V U S – ""RIVUS"" – not common.
- R I V E R – E is ruled out.
- R I V A L – A is ruled out.
- R I V U S – seems obscure.

Another approach: since S is only confirmed in position 5, and we need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet used and not ruled out. Ruled out letters: A, O, E, K. So possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- R I V E S – E ruled out.
- R I V U S – U is allowed, but is this a word? ""RIVUS"" is not standard.
- R I V A L – A ruled out.
- R I V A L – same.
- R I V E R – E ruled out.
- R I V A N – A ruled out.
- R I V U S – not standard.
- R I V U S – no.

Wait, perhaps ""RIVUS"" is acceptable as a variant. Alternatively, ""RIVUS"" might not be. Let me think of other combinations.

Another candidate: R I V E N – E ruled out.
R I V E N – same.
R I V U S – no.

Another candidate: R I V A L – A ruled out.
R I V A N – A ruled out.
R I V E N – E ruled out.
R I V E S – E ruled out.

This seems difficult. Let me try with different consonants.

R I N G S – G is allowed, but this has S in position 5, and we need to check if S is in position 3. In RINGS, S is in position 5, and position 3 is G, so this would fit:
- R(✓) I(✓) N _ G S – but position 3 is G, position 4 is S? No, RINGS is R-I-N-G-S.

Wait, R I N G S is R(1) I(2) N(3) G(4) S(5). From feedback:
- R(✓) – correct.
- I(✓) – correct.
- N(3) – not tested yet.
- G(4) – not tested yet.
- S(5) – correct.

But we know S is in the word but not in position 3, which is satisfied since S is in position 5. This seems valid. However, we need to check if this uses any ruled-out letters. Ruled-out letters: A, O, E, K. RINGS uses R, I, N, G, S – none of which are ruled out, and it fits the pattern.

Therefore, ""RINGS"" is a valid next guess.From the feedback:
- R is correct in position 1.
- I is correct in position 2.
- S is correct in position 5.
- S is in the word but not in position 3 (so the only remaining place for the second S is position 4, but position 4 is K(x) in RISKS, which is not S). This suggests the word has only one S in position 5, and the earlier S in position 3 was just confirming S is in the word but not in position 3 (which is already satisfied).

Thus, the word is R I _ _ S with positions 3 and 4 to be determined. A common word fitting this is ""RINGS"" (R-I-N-G-S).

R(✓) – R is in the word AND in the correct position (position 1).\n2. I(✓) – I is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).\n3. S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 3.\n4. K(x) – K is NOT in the word.\n5. S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).\n\nSo we now know:\n- The word starts with R, has I in position 2, and ends with S.\n- It must contain an additional S somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since S is in the word but not in position 3, the only remaining place is position 4).\n- Letters already ruled out: A, O, E, K.\n- Remaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern is:\nR I _ S with an S in position 4, making it R I S S ? — but that would be 5 letters, so actually:\nR I _ _ S with an S in position 4, so the word must be R I S _ S. Wait, that would be 5 letters: R I S _ S.\n\nBut that would require position 4 to be S, but the feedback says S is in position 5. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe word is R I _ _ S (positions 1-5). From the feedback on RISKS:\n- Position 1: R(✓) – correct.\n- Position 2: I(✓) – correct.\n- Position 3: S(-) – S is in the word but not here.\n- Position 4: K(x) – K not here.\n- Position 5: S(✓) – S is here.\n\nSo the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be another S in position 3 or 4. But position 3 is marked as ""S(-)"" meaning S is not in position 3, so the S must be in position 4. But position 4 is K(x), so that can\'t be. This seems contradictory.\n\nWait, no – the feedback for RISKS is:\nR(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)\nThis means:\n- R is correct in position 1.\n- I is correct in position 2.\n- S in position 3 is in the word but wrong position (so S must be elsewhere).\n- K is not in the word.\n- S in position 5 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be an S in position 3 or 4, but position 3 is marked as S(-), so S must be in position 4. But position 4 is K(x), which is not S. This suggests the word must be R I S _ S, but that would be 5 letters: R I S _ S. However, position 4 would then be the missing letter, and position 5 is S. This seems possible.\n\nBut looking at common words, ""RISUS"" comes to mind (a medical term), but U is allowed. Alternatively, ""RISPS"" but P is allowed. However, ""RISPS"" has P in position 4 and S in 5. But we know S is in position 5, and we need an S in position 3 or 4. Since position 3 is marked as S(-), the S must be in position 4, but position 4 is K(x) in RISKS. This seems conflicting.\n\nWait, the feedback for RISKS is:\nR(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)\nThis means:\n- R is correct in position 1.\n- I is correct in position 2.\n- The S in position 3 is in the word but wrong position (so S must be in position 4 or 5).\n- K is not in the word.\n- The S in position 5 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be an S in position 4 (since position 3\'s S is wrong position and position 5 is correct). So the word must be R I S _ S, but that would require position 4 to be S, making it R I S S S, which is 5 letters. But that seems unlikely.\n\nThis suggests the word must be R I S _ S, but position 4 would need to be S, making it R I S S S, which is not a common word. This seems like a contradiction, indicating I might have misinterpreted.\n\nRe-reading the feedback:\n- R(✓) – R is correct in position 1.\n- I(✓) – I is correct in position 2.\n- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.\n- K(x) – K is not in the word.\n- S(✓) – S is correct in position 5.\n\nTherefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be an S in position 3 or 4 (since S is in the word but not in position 3, it must be in position 4). So the word is R I _ S S. But that would be R I _ S S, which is 5 letters. The missing letter in position 3 must be a consonant not yet ruled out.\n\nPossible words:\n- R I N S S – ""RINSS"" – not valid.\n- R I D S S – ""RIDD S"" – no.\n- R I P S S – ""RIPSS"" – no.\n- R I B S S – ""RIBSS"" – no.\n- R I C S S – ""RICSS"" – no.\n- R I V S S – ""RIVSS"" – no.\n- R I L S S – ""RILSS"" – no.\n\nThis seems problematic. Perhaps the word has only one S in position 5, and the S in position 3 was just indicating S is in the word but not in position 3, which is already satisfied by S in position 5. Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S with no additional S needed, and the S in position 3 was just confirming S is in the word but not in position 3 (which is already the case since S is in position 5).\n\nTherefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and we need to find a consonant for position 3 and 4. Common words:\n- R I V E S – but E is ruled out.\n- R I V A L – but A is ruled out.\n- R I V U S – U is allowed, but is this a word?\n- R I V U S – ""RIVUS"" – not common.\n- R I V E R – E is ruled out.\n- R I V A L – A is ruled out.\n- R I V U S – seems obscure.\n\nAnother approach: since S is only confirmed in position 5, and we need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet used and not ruled out. Ruled out letters: A, O, E, K. So possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.\n\nPossible words:\n- R I V E S – E ruled out.\n- R I V U S – U is allowed, but is this a word? ""RIVUS"" is not standard.\n- R I V A L – A ruled out.\n- R I V A L – same.\n- R I V E R – E ruled out.\n- R I V A N – A ruled out.\n- R I V U S – not standard.\n- R I V U S – no.\n\nWait, perhaps ""RIVUS"" is acceptable as a variant. Alternatively, ""RIVUS"" might not be. Let me think of other combinations.\n\nAnother candidate: R I V E N – E ruled out.\nR I V E N – same.\nR I V U S – no.\n\nAnother candidate: R I V A L – A ruled out.\nR I V A N – A ruled out.\nR I V E N – E ruled out.\nR I V E S – E ruled out.\n\nThis seems difficult. Let me try with different consonants.\n\nR I N G S – G is allowed, but this has S in position 5, and we need to check if S is in position 3. In RINGS, S is in position 5, and position 3 is G, so this would fit:\n- R(✓) I(✓) N _ G S – but position 3 is G, position 4 is S? No, RINGS is R-I-N-G-S.\n\nWait, R I N G S is R(1) I(2) N(3) G(4) S(5). From feedback:\n- R(✓) – correct.\n- I(✓) – correct.\n- N(3) – not tested yet.\n- G(4) – not tested yet.\n- S(5) – correct.\n\nBut we know S is in the word but not in position 3, which is satisfied since S is in position 5. This seems valid. However, we need to check if this uses any ruled-out letters. Ruled-out letters: A, O, E, K. RINGS uses R, I, N, G, S – none of which are ruled out, and it fits the pattern.\n\nTherefore, ""RINGS"" is a valid next guess.From the feedback:\n- R is correct in position 1.\n- I is correct in position 2.\n- S is correct in position 5.\n- S is in the word but not in position 3 (so the only remaining place for the second S is position 4, but position 4 is K(x) in RISKS, which is not S). This suggests the word has only one S in position 5, and the earlier S in position 3 was just confirming S is in the word but not in position 3 (which is already satisfied).\n\nThus, the word is R I _ _ S with positions 3 and 4 to be determined. A common word fitting this is ""RINGS"" (R-I-N-G-S).\n\n<guess>RINGS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: RISKS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)\nGuess 3: RINGS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) N(x) G(x) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on RINGS:\n\n1.

From the feedback on RIFTS we now know:

- R(✓) – R is correct in position 1.
- I(✓) – I is correct in position 2.
- F(x) – F is NOT in the word.
- T(x) – T is NOT in the word.
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 5.

So the word pattern is R I _ _ S, and the letters in positions 3 and 4 must come from the remaining unused letters that have not been ruled out.

Letters already ruled out:
- A, O, E (from AROSE)
- K (from RISKS)
- N, G (from RINGS)
- F, T (from RIFTS)

Remaining possible consonants/vowels: B, C, D, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 4 from this set.

- R I B _ S → RIBBS (double B), RIBMS – not common.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us coverage of 5 of the 10 most common letters in English, which should provide good information about what letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- R and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, O, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes R and S (but R not in position 2 and S not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Possible candidates:
- R and S must be placed in different positions. Let's try to place R in position 1 (since it can't be in 2) and S in position 3 (since it can't be in 4).
- Fill the remaining slots with common letters that haven't been ruled out.

A word that fits: ""RUSTY""
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R can't be in 2).
- S is not in the word at all (but we know S is in the word, so this is bad).

Let's try ""FRISK"":
- F, R, I, S, K
- R is in position 2 (but R can't be in 2), so this is invalid.

Try ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, S, P
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""DRIPS"":
- D, R, I, P, S
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""TRISK"":
- T, R, I, S, K
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""GRIST"":
- G, R, I, S, T
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""PRISM"":
- P, R, I, S, M
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try ""RISKS"":
- R in position 1 (allowed), S in position 4 (invalid, since S can't be in 4).

Try ""RUSTY"" is invalid because S is not present. Let's try ""RUSTY"" is invalid.

Wait, we need S in the word but not in position 4. Let's try ""URSIN"" (but this is not a valid word).

Let's try ""CRUST"":
- C, R, U, S, T
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Let's try ""BRISK"":
- B, R, I, S, K
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Let's try ""DRIPS"" again - R is in position 2.

Let's try ""GRIST"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""PRISM"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""TRISK"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""CRISP"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""FRISK"" - R in position 2.

Let's try ""RUSTY"" - S is not present.

Let's try ""RISKS"" - S in position 5 (valid), R in position 1 (valid).

""RISKS"" is a valid word:
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R can't be in 2).
- S in position 4 (invalid, since S can't be in 4).

Wait, S is in position 4 here, which is invalid.

Let's try ""RISKS"" - S is in position 5, which is allowed.

""RISKS"":
- R in position 1 (valid, since R can't be in 2).
- S in position 5 (valid, since S can't be in 4).
- Contains R and S.
- Excludes A, O, E.
- Uses I, K, which are new letters.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""CRISP"" - but R is in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""FRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""GRIST"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""PRISM"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""TRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Another candidate: ""BRISK"" - R in position 2 (invalid).

Let's try ""RISKS"" as it seems to fit.

But let's check if there's a better word.

Alternative approach: place R in position 3 and S in position 1.

Word: ""S R _ _ _"" but R is in position 3.

""SR..."" is not common.

Let's try ""RISKS"" again - seems to be the best valid word fitting constraints.

But ""RISKS"" has S in position 5, which is allowed.

Therefore, ""RISKS"" is a valid next guess.Based on the feedback that R and S are in the word but in wrong positions, and A, O, E are not present, I'll try a word that places R and S in new positions while introducing fresh letters.

Guess 2: RISKS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RISKS:

1. R(✓) – R is in the word AND in the correct position (position 1).
2. I(✓) – I is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
3. S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
4. K(x) – K is NOT in the word.
5. S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know:
- The word starts with R, has I in position 2, and ends with S.
- It must contain an additional S somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since S is in the word but not in position 3, the only remaining place is position 4).
- Letters already ruled out: A, O, E, K.
- Remaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Putting this together, the pattern is:
R I _ S with an S in position 4, making it R I S S ? — but that would be 5 letters, so actually:
R I _ _ S with an S in position 4, so the word must be R I S _ S. Wait, that would be 5 letters: R I S _ S.

But that would require position 4 to be S, but the feedback says S is in position 5. Let me re-examine:

The word is R I _ _ S (positions 1-5). From the feedback on RISKS:
- Position 1: R(✓) – correct.
- Position 2: I(✓) – correct.
- Position 3: S(-) – S is in the word but not here.
- Position 4: K(x) – K not here.
- Position 5: S(✓) – S is here.

So the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be another S in position 3 or 4. But position 3 is marked as ""S(-)"" meaning S is not in position 3, so the S must be in position 4. But position 4 is K(x), so that can't be. This seems contradictory.

Wait, no – the feedback for RISKS is:
R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)
This means:
- R is correct in position 1.
- I is correct in position 2.
- S in position 3 is in the word but wrong position (so S must be elsewhere).
- K is not in the word.
- S in position 5 is correct.

Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be an S in position 3 or 4, but position 3 is marked as S(-), so S must be in position 4. But position 4 is K(x), which is not S. This suggests the word must be R I S _ S, but that would be 5 letters: R I S _ S. However, position 4 would then be the missing letter, and position 5 is S. This seems possible.

But looking at common words, ""RISUS"" comes to mind (a medical term), but U is allowed. Alternatively, ""RISPS"" but P is allowed. However, ""RISPS"" has P in position 4 and S in 5. But we know S is in position 5, and we need an S in position 3 or 4. Since position 3 is marked as S(-), the S must be in position 4, but position 4 is K(x) in RISKS. This seems conflicting.

Wait, the feedback for RISKS is:
R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)
This means:
- R is correct in position 1.
- I is correct in position 2.
- The S in position 3 is in the word but wrong position (so S must be in position 4 or 5).
- K is not in the word.
- The S in position 5 is correct.

Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be an S in position 4 (since position 3's S is wrong position and position 5 is correct). So the word must be R I S _ S, but that would require position 4 to be S, making it R I S S S, which is 5 letters. But that seems unlikely.

This suggests the word must be R I S _ S, but position 4 would need to be S, making it R I S S S, which is not a common word. This seems like a contradiction, indicating I might have misinterpreted.

Re-reading the feedback:
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 1.
- I(✓) – I is correct in position 2.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.
- K(x) – K is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 5.

Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and there must be an S in position 3 or 4 (since S is in the word but not in position 3, it must be in position 4). So the word is R I _ S S. But that would be R I _ S S, which is 5 letters. The missing letter in position 3 must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Possible words:
- R I N S S – ""RINSS"" – not valid.
- R I D S S – ""RIDD S"" – no.
- R I P S S – ""RIPSS"" – no.
- R I B S S – ""RIBSS"" – no.
- R I C S S – ""RICSS"" – no.
- R I V S S – ""RIVSS"" – no.
- R I L S S – ""RILSS"" – no.

This seems problematic. Perhaps the word has only one S in position 5, and the S in position 3 was just indicating S is in the word but not in position 3, which is already satisfied by S in position 5. Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S with no additional S needed, and the S in position 3 was just confirming S is in the word but not in position 3 (which is already the case since S is in position 5).

Therefore, the word is R I _ _ S, and we need to find a consonant for position 3 and 4. Common words:
- R I V E S – but E is ruled out.
- R I V A L – but A is ruled out.
- R I V U S – U is allowed, but is this a word?
- R I V U S – ""RIVUS"" – not common.
- R I V E R – E is ruled out.
- R I V A L – A is ruled out.
- R I V U S – seems obscure.

Another approach: since S is only confirmed in position 5, and we need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet used and not ruled out. Ruled out letters: A, O, E, K. So possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- R I V E S – E ruled out.
- R I V U S – U is allowed, but is this a word? ""RIVUS"" is not standard.
- R I V A L – A ruled out.
- R I V A L – same.
- R I V E R – E ruled out.
- R I V A N – A ruled out.
- R I V U S – not standard.
- R I V U S – no.

Wait, perhaps ""RIVUS"" is acceptable as a variant. Alternatively, ""RIVUS"" might not be. Let me think of other combinations.

Another candidate: R I V E N – E ruled out.
R I V E N – same.
R I V U S – no.

Another candidate: R I V A L – A ruled out.
R I V A N – A ruled out.
R I V E N – E ruled out.
R I V E S – E ruled out.

This seems difficult. Let me try with different consonants.

R I N G S – G is allowed, but this has S in position 5, and we need to check if S is in position 3. In RINGS, S is in position 5, and position 3 is G, so this would fit:
- R(✓) I(✓) N _ G S – but position 3 is G, position 4 is S? No, RINGS is R-I-N-G-S.

Wait, R I N G S is R(1) I(2) N(3) G(4) S(5). From feedback:
- R(✓) – correct.
- I(✓) – correct.
- N(3) – not tested yet.
- G(4) – not tested yet.
- S(5) – correct.

But we know S is in the word but not in position 3, which is satisfied since S is in position 5. This seems valid. However, we need to check if this uses any ruled-out letters. Ruled-out letters: A, O, E, K. RINGS uses R, I, N, G, S – none of which are ruled out, and it fits the pattern.

Therefore, ""RINGS"" is a valid next guess.From the feedback:
- R is correct in position 1.
- I is correct in position 2.
- S is correct in position 5.
- S is in the word but not in position 3 (so the only remaining place for the second S is position 4, but position 4 is K(x) in RISKS, which is not S). This suggests the word has only one S in position 5, and the earlier S in position 3 was just confirming S is in the word but not in position 3 (which is already satisfied).

Thus, the word is R I _ _ S with positions 3 and 4 to be determined. A common word fitting this is ""RINGS"" (R-I-N-G-S).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)

Guess 3: RINGS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) N(x) G(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RINGS:

1. R(✓) – R is correct in position 1.
2. I(✓) – I is correct in position 2.
3. N(x) – N is NOT in the word.
4. G(x) – G is NOT in the word.
5. S(✓) – S is correct in position 5.

So the word is R I _ _ S, and positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters that have not yet been ruled out.

Letters already ruled out:
- From AROSE: A, O, E
- From RISKS: K
- From RINGS: N, G

Remaining possible letters (common consonants/vowels): B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y

We need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 4 from this set.

Possible combinations:
- R I B _ S: RIBBS (double B), RIBMS – not common.
- R I C _ S: RICOS (O ruled out), RICHS – not common.
- R I D _ S: RIDDS (double D), RIDLS – not common.
- R I F _ S: RIFTS – common word.
- R I L _ S: RILTS – not common, RILYS – not common.
- R I M _ S: RIMDS – not common.
- R I P _ S: RIPSS – not common.
- R I T _ S: RITDS – not common.
- R I U _ S: RIU DS – not common.
- R I V _ S: RIVDS – not common.
- R I W _ S: RIWDS – not common.
- R I Y _ S: RIYDS – not common.

The only common word fitting is RIFTS (R-I-F-T-S).

Check:
- R(✓) I(✓) F _ T S – positions 3 and 4 are F and T.
- Letters used: R, I, F, T, S – none ruled out.
- S is in position 5 (✓).
- N and G are not used, so no conflict.

Therefore, ""RIFTS"" is the best next guess.

A common word fitting this is ""RINGS"" (R-I-N-G-S).\n\n<guess>RINGS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: RISKS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)\nGuess 3: RINGS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) N(x) G(x) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on RINGS:\n\n1.

From all feedback so far we know:

1. The word is R I _ _ S (R in 1st, I in 2nd, S in 5th).
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, K, N, G, F, T.
3. Therefore positions 3 and 4 must be filled from the remaining unused letters:
   B, C, D, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need two distinct letters from this set to form a valid English word.

Possible combinations:
- R I B _ S → RIBBS (double B) – not valid
- R I C _ S → RICHS (not valid)
- R I D _ S → RIDDY (but ends with Y, not S) – not valid
- R I L _ S → RILTS (not valid)
- R I M _ S → RIMDS (not valid)
- R I P _ S → RIPSS (not valid)
- R I U _ S → RIUDS (not valid)
- R I V _ S → RIVDS (not valid)
- R I W _ S → RIWDS (not valid)
- R I Y _ S → RIYDS (not valid)

Looking at this list, the only valid English word that fits is RIVULS (a variant spelling of ripples, but that's 7 letters). Actually, let me reconsider – the valid word here is RIVULS isn't correct.

Wait, let's list all 5-letter words matching R I _ _ S with the allowed letters:

- R I V U S – ""RIVUS"" (not standard)
- R I V A S – A ruled out
- R I C H S – ""RICH S"" (not a word)
- R I V E S – E ruled out
- R I V O S – O ruled out
- R I V U S – closest valid is ""RIVULS"" but that's 7 letters.

Actually, the correct valid word fitting R I _ _ S with remaining letters is RIVULS (but that's 7 letters). Let me double-check.

Upon reflection, the only valid English word fitting R I _ _ S with allowed letters is RIVULS (a variant of ripples) but it's 7 letters. This suggests I missed a word.

Rechecking: R I V U S is not standard. The valid word is actually RIVULS but it's 7 letters. This indicates an error in my previous step.

Let me re-examine allowed letters: B, C, D, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Valid 5-letter words:
- R I V U S – not standard
- R I V A S – A ruled out
- R I C H S – ""RICH S"" – not a word
- R I V E S – E ruled out
- R I V O S – O ruled out
- R I V U S – not standard
- R I V Y S – not standard
- R I D D S – ""RIDD S"" – not a word
- R I L L S – ""RILLS"" – valid word!

""RILLS"" uses:
- R(✓) I(✓) L L S – positions 3 and 4 are L and L (double L)
- Letters: R, I, L, L, S – none ruled out
- S is in position 5 (✓)

This fits perfectly.
