From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the 3rd letter is I
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word has:
- I in the 3rd position: _ _ I _ _
- Contains S somewhere, but not in position 4
- Does NOT contain R, A, or E

I need a 5-letter word that fits:
- _ _ I _ _
- Has an S somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5)
- Uses only letters not ruled out (no R, A, E)

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S and I.

Let’s try a word that uses S in a new position and common letters. A good candidate is ""SILKY"":
- S in position 1 (new position)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- L, K are new letters
- Y is new
- No R, A, or E

But let me check if SILKY is valid – yes, it is a common word.

Another option is ""STINK"":
- S in position 1
- T, N, K are new
- I in position 3

I think STINK is a strong choice because it uses common letters and places S in a new position.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)

- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the 3rd letter is I
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else

So the secret word has:
- I in the 3rd position: _ _ I _ _
- Contains S somewhere, but not in position 4
- Does NOT contain R, A, or E

I need a 5-letter word that fits:
- _ _ I _ _

- I in position 3 (matches)

2. Place S in a new position (2, 4, or 5)
3. Introduce new common letters

Let’s try placing S in position 2: _ S I _ _
Common letters left: C, D, L, M, P, U, etc.

A word that fits: ""SUSIE"" – but E is forbidden.  
""SPIKE"" – K is forbidden.  
""SHIM"" – too short.  
""SPIRE"" – R and E forbidden.  
""SWISH"" – too long.  
""CLIMB"" – doesn’t have S.  
""PLUSH"" – doesn’t have S.  
""SHYLY"" – doesn’t have S.  
""SHIPS"" – S in position 5, but P and H are new.  
""SHIPS"" fits: _ _ I _ _ with S in position 5, and H, P are new letters.

Let me verify:
- SHIPS: S in position 5 (new position), H and P are new, I in position 3 (correct), no forbidden letters.  
This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""DUSIK"" – but K is forbidden.  
""DISHS"" – S in position 5, but H is repeated and we don’t know about H yet.  
""SHIPS"" is better.

I’ll go with SHIPS.

Let’s summarize everything we now know:

1. The secret word has the pattern: _ _ I _ S  (I in position 3, S in position 5).
2. Forbidden letters (never appear): R, A, E, T, N, K, H, P.
3. Allowed letters (so far): B, C, D, F, G, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S and I (already placed).
4. We still need to test common remaining consonants and vowels.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “IS” that uses only allowed letters.  
Common endings for “IS” include:
- LIS (but L is allowed, but we’d need 4 letters before it – this is too short)
- VIS (same issue)
- MIS (same)
- WIS (same)
- CIS (same)
- DIS (same)
- LIS (same)

Wait, the pattern is _ _ I _ S, so the last two letters are IS.  
That means we need a 5-letter word whose last two letters are IS and whose first three letters use only allowed letters.

Let’s list possible words ending in IS with allowed letters:
- BISCU – too long
- CIVIS – too long
- DULIS – not a valid word
- FUSIS – not valid
- LIMIS – not valid
- MUSIS – not valid
- VIS – too short
- WIS – too short

Actually, the only valid 5-letter English word ending in IS with the pattern _ _ I _ S is “CIVIS” (a Latin-derived word meaning citizen), but it’s obscure.  
Another is “DULIS” (not valid).  
“MUSIS” is not valid.  
“VIS” is too short.  
“CIVIS” is the only valid one that comes to mind.

But let’s double-check:  
“CIVIS” – letters C, I, V, I, S.  
- C: allowed  
- I: already known to be in position 3  
- V: allowed  
- I: already known to be in position 3  
- S: already known to be in position 5  

This fits all constraints.  
However, “CIVIS” is quite obscure.  
Another possibility: “LIMIS” – but that’s not a valid word.  
“DISCUS” – too long.  
“VIS” – too short.  

Wait, the pattern is _ _ I _ S, so the word must be 5 letters ending in IS.  
Valid English words ending in IS with 5 letters:  
- CIVIS (as above)  
- DULIS (not valid)  
- MUSIS (not valid)  
- VIS – too short  
- LIS – too short  

It seems “CIVIS” is the only valid candidate.  
But let me think differently: maybe the word isn’t ending in IS, but I and S are in positions 3 and 5 respectively.  
That is, the pattern is _ _ I _ S, but the last two letters don’t have to be IS.  
Wait, no: the pattern is _ _ I _ S, meaning the third letter is I and the fifth is S.  
So the word is of the form A B I C S, with A, B, C being letters not forbidden.  

Forbidden letters: R, A, E, T, N, K, H, P.  
Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S and I (already placed).  

We need a 5-letter word with letters A, B, C, D, F, G, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, S, where the third letter is I and the fifth is S.  

Possible words:

- DULIS – not valid  
- LIVIS – not valid

- OXIS – too short

Actually, “CIVIS” is the only valid word that fits.  
But let me check a dictionary:  
- CIVIS – valid (as in “the CIVIS of Rome”)  
- DULIS – not valid  
- LIVIS – not valid  
- MUSIS – not valid  

Therefore, “CIVIS” is the logical next guess.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should include several of these.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and has no repeated letters, giving maximum information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the 3rd letter is I
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word has:
- I in the 3rd position: _ _ I _ _
- Contains S somewhere, but not in position 4
- Does NOT contain R, A, or E

I need a 5-letter word that fits:
- _ _ I _ _
- Has an S somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5)
- Uses only letters not ruled out (no R, A, E)

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S and I.

Let’s try a word that uses S in a new position and common letters. A good candidate is ""SILKY"":
- S in position 1 (new position)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- L, K are new letters
- Y is new
- No R, A, or E

But let me check if SILKY is valid – yes, it is a common word.

Another option is ""STINK"":
- S in position 1
- T, N, K are new
- I in position 3
- No R, A, E

I think STINK is a strong choice because it uses common letters and places S in a new position.

- S must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5
- Forbidden letters so far: R, A, E, T, N, K
- We still need to test other common letters like L, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep I in position 3
2. Place S in a new position (2, 4, or 5)
3. Introduce new common letters

Let’s try placing S in position 2: _ S I _ _
Common letters left: C, D, L, M, P, U, etc.

A word that fits: ""SUSIE"" – but E is forbidden.  
""SPIKE"" – K is forbidden.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after four guesses:

1. Word structure:

   - 5th letter is definitely S (✓ from SHIPS and CIVIS).

2. Forbidden letters (never appear):  
   R, A, E, T, N, K, H, P, C, V.

3. Allowed letters (still possible):  
   B, D, F, G, J, L, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z, plus S and I (I must appear somewhere, but not in positions 2 or 3).

4. Pattern so far:

5. We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing exactly one I in position 1 or 4, using only allowed letters.

Let’s list possible words:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should include several of these.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and has no repeated letters, giving maximum information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the 3rd letter is I
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word has:
- I in the 3rd position: _ _ I _ _
- Contains S somewhere, but not in position 4
- Does NOT contain R, A, or E

I need a 5-letter word that fits:
- _ _ I _ _
- Has an S somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5)
- Uses only letters not ruled out (no R, A, E)

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S and I.

Let’s try a word that uses S in a new position and common letters. A good candidate is ""SILKY"":
- S in position 1 (new position)
- I in position 3 (matches)
- L, K are new letters
- Y is new
- No R, A, or E

But let me check if SILKY is valid – yes, it is a common word.

Another option is ""STINK"":
- S in position 1
- T, N, K are new
- I in position 3
- No R, A, E

I think STINK is a strong choice because it uses common letters and places S in a new position.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STINK:

- S is still in the word but NOT in position 1 (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- I is confirmed in position 3 (✓)
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- K is NOT in the word (x)

So we now know:
- Word pattern: _ _ I _ _
- S must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5
- Forbidden letters so far: R, A, E, T, N, K
- We still need to test other common letters like L, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep I in position 3
2. Place S in a new position (2, 4, or 5)
3. Introduce new common letters

Let’s try placing S in position 2: _ S I _ _
Common letters left: C, D, L, M, P, U, etc.

A word that fits: ""SUSIE"" – but E is forbidden.  
""SPIKE"" – K is forbidden.  
""SHIM"" – too short.  
""SPIRE"" – R and E forbidden.  
""SWISH"" – too long.  
""CLIMB"" – doesn’t have S.  
""PLUSH"" – doesn’t have S.  
""SHYLY"" – doesn’t have S.  
""SHIPS"" – S in position 5, but P and H are new.  
""SHIPS"" fits: _ _ I _ _ with S in position 5, and H, P are new letters.

Let me verify:
- SHIPS: S in position 5 (new position), H and P are new, I in position 3 (correct), no forbidden letters.  
This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""DUSIK"" – but K is forbidden.  
""DISHS"" – S in position 5, but H is repeated and we don’t know about H yet.  
""SHIPS"" is better.

I’ll go with SHIPS.

Let’s summarize everything we now know:

1. The secret word has the pattern: _ _ I _ S  (I in position 3, S in position 5).
2. Forbidden letters (never appear): R, A, E, T, N, K, H, P.
3. Allowed letters (so far): B, C, D, F, G, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S and I (already placed).
4. We still need to test common remaining consonants and vowels.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “IS” that uses only allowed letters.  
Common endings for “IS” include:
- LIS (but L is allowed, but we’d need 4 letters before it – this is too short)
- VIS (same issue)
- MIS (same)
- WIS (same)
- CIS (same)
- DIS (same)
- LIS (same)

Wait, the pattern is _ _ I _ S, so the last two letters are IS.  
That means we need a 5-letter word whose last two letters are IS and whose first three letters use only allowed letters.

Let’s list possible words ending in IS with allowed letters:
- BISCU – too long
- CIVIS – too long
- DULIS – not a valid word
- FUSIS – not valid
- LIMIS – not valid
- MUSIS – not valid
- VIS – too short
- WIS – too short

Actually, the only valid 5-letter English word ending in IS with the pattern _ _ I _ S is “CIVIS” (a Latin-derived word meaning citizen), but it’s obscure.  
Another is “DULIS” (not valid).  
“MUSIS” is not valid.  
“VIS” is too short.  
“CIVIS” is the only valid one that comes to mind.

But let’s double-check:  
“CIVIS” – letters C, I, V, I, S.  
- C: allowed  
- I: already known to be in position 3  
- V: allowed  
- I: already known to be in position 3  
- S: already known to be in position 5  

This fits all constraints.  
However, “CIVIS” is quite obscure.  
Another possibility: “LIMIS” – but that’s not a valid word.  
“DISCUS” – too long.  
“VIS” – too short.  

Wait, the pattern is _ _ I _ S, so the word must be 5 letters ending in IS.  
Valid English words ending in IS with 5 letters:  
- CIVIS (as above)  
- DULIS (not valid)  
- MUSIS (not valid)  
- VIS – too short  
- LIS – too short  

It seems “CIVIS” is the only valid candidate.  
But let me think differently: maybe the word isn’t ending in IS, but I and S are in positions 3 and 5 respectively.  
That is, the pattern is _ _ I _ S, but the last two letters don’t have to be IS.  
Wait, no: the pattern is _ _ I _ S, meaning the third letter is I and the fifth is S.  
So the word is of the form A B I C S, with A, B, C being letters not forbidden.  

Forbidden letters: R, A, E, T, N, K, H, P.  
Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus S and I (already placed).  

We need a 5-letter word with letters A, B, C, D, F, G, J, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, S, where the third letter is I and the fifth is S.  

Possible words:
- BIVOS – not valid  
- CIVOS – not valid  
- DULIS – not valid  
- LIVIS – not valid  
- MIVOS – not valid  
- OXIS – too short  
- VIVIS – too long  
- WIVIS – not valid  

Actually, “CIVIS” is the only valid word that fits.  
But let me check a dictionary:  
- CIVIS – valid (as in “the CIVIS of Rome”)  
- DULIS – not valid  
- LIVIS – not valid  
- MUSIS – not valid  

Therefore, “CIVIS” is the logical next guess.

From all feedback so far:

1. Position 5 is definitely S (✓ in every guess except the first).
2. Forbidden letters (never appear): R, A, E, T, N, K, H, P, C, V, B, L.
3. Allowed letters left: D, F, G, J, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z, plus I (which must appear exactly once, not in positions 2, 3, 4).
4. Since I cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, and position 5 is S, the only possible place for I is position 1.
5. We need a 5-letter word of the form I _ _ _ S, using only allowed letters in positions 2-4.

Possible letters for positions 2-4: D, F, G, J, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common English words:
- IFFYS – too long
- IGLOO – too long
- IGONS – not valid
- IGGYS – not valid
- IMLYS – not valid
- IMPOS – not valid
- INGOT – N is forbidden
- IRONS – R is forbidden
- IGGYs – plural, but not a word
- IGGY – too short
- IGLOO – too long

Actually, let's list valid 5-letter words starting with I and ending with S, using only allowed letters:
- IGLOO – too long
- IGLOO – too long
- IGGYS – plural, but not standard
- ILLIS – L is forbidden
- ILLIS – L is forbidden
- IFFYS – F, Y allowed
- IFFYS – F, F, Y allowed
- IGGYS – G, Y allowed
- IGGYS – G, G, Y allowed

The only valid word is IFFYS (plural of IFFY), but Y is allowed and F is allowed.

Check: I F F Y S – all letters allowed, I in position 1 (required), S in position 5 (required).

Therefore, the next guess is IFFYS.
