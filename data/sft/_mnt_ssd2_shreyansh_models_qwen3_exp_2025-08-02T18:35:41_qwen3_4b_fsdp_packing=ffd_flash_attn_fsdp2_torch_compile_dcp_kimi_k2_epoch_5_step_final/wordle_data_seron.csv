### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage to determine which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Letters known NOT in the word:

So far we have:
S _ R _ _

We need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with the remaining letters: O, E, and one more letter that hasn't been tested yet (since we have 5 positions and only 4 confirmed letters). The fifth letter must be from the remaining unused letters (common ones: L, N, C, etc.).

But we have only two letters (O, E) that must appear somewhere, and one more letter to fill the third spot. However, we already have S, R confirmed, and we know O and E must be used. That means the word must be S _ R _ _ with O and E in positions 4 and 5 (but E cannot be in 5), so E must be in 4 and O in 5. But O cannot be in 5 because in Guess 1, O was in position 3 and got (-), meaning O is not in 3, but could be in 5. Wait, let me re-examine:

From Guess 1: AROSE -> O(-) means O is not in position 3.
From Guess 2: STORE -> O(-) means O is not in position 3 (same info).
From Guess 3: SORED -> O(-) means O is not in position 2.

So O cannot be in positions 2 or 3, but could be in 4 or 5.

From Guess 2: STORE -> E(-) means E is not in position 5 (same info).
From Guess 3: SORED -> E(-) means E is not in position 4.

So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, meaning E must be in position 2.

So we have:
S E R _ _

Now we need to place O in either position 4 or 5 (but O cannot be in 2 or 3). Also, we need a fifth letter that hasn't been used yet (since we have S, E, R, O, and need one more letter). The unused letters are not A, T, D, and we haven't tested B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage to determine which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains R, O, S, E (but not in the positions guessed).
- Does NOT contain A.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R, O, S, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively).
2. Does not use A.

Possible positions:
- R cannot be in position 2.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

I’ll look for a word that places these letters in new positions and introduces a new letter that hasn’t been tested yet (since we know A is out).

A good candidate is “STORE”:
- S in position 1 (new)
- T (new letter)
- O in position 2 (new)
- R in position 3 (new)
- E in position 4 (new)

This tests new positions for R, O, S, E and introduces T.

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Starts with S (position 1 is confirmed).
- Contains O, R, E but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A or T.

Remaining positions to fill (2, 3, 4, 5) must use O, R, E and possibly one new letter (since we have 4 letters to place in 4 positions). The letters we know are in the word: S (fixed at 1), O, R, E. We need to place O, R, E in positions 2-5 while respecting the positional bans:
- O cannot be in position 3.
- R cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

Possible positions for each:
- O: 2, 4, 5
- R: 2, 3, 5
- E: 2, 3, 4

We need to find a valid permutation of O, R, E plus one more letter (but we already have S fixed at 1, and the total letters must be 5). Wait, we have S, O, R, E – that’s 4 letters, so the fifth letter must be one we haven’t tried yet (since A and T are out). Common unused letters: D, L, N, C, etc.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage to determine which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains R, O, S, E (but not in the positions guessed).
- Does NOT contain A.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R, O, S, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively).
2. Does not use A.

Possible positions:
- R cannot be in position 2.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

I’ll look for a word that places these letters in new positions and introduces a new letter that hasn’t been tested yet (since we know A is out).

A good candidate is “STORE”:
- S in position 1 (new)
- T (new letter)
- O in position 2 (new)
- R in position 3 (new)
- E in position 4 (new)

This tests new positions for R, O, S, E and introduces T.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STORE:
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- T(x) – T is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Starts with S (position 1 is confirmed).
- Contains O, R, E but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A or T.

Remaining positions to fill (2, 3, 4, 5) must use O, R, E and possibly one new letter (since we have 4 letters to place in 4 positions). The letters we know are in the word: S (fixed at 1), O, R, E. We need to place O, R, E in positions 2-5 while respecting the positional bans:
- O cannot be in position 3.
- R cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

Possible positions for each:
- O: 2, 4, 5
- R: 2, 3, 5
- E: 2, 3, 4

We need to find a valid permutation of O, R, E plus one more letter (but we already have S fixed at 1, and the total letters must be 5). Wait, we have S, O, R, E – that’s 4 letters, so the fifth letter must be one we haven’t tried yet (since A and T are out). Common unused letters: D, L, N, C, etc.

Let me think of words that start with S and contain O, R, E in the remaining positions. A good candidate is ""SORED"":
- S (fixed at 1)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- D (new letter, not banned)

This fits all constraints.

Guess 3: SORED -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) R(✓) E(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From Guess 3 (SORED):
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 1.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 2.
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 3.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 4.
- D(x) – D is not in the word.

Current confirmed letters and positions:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: R

Letters known to be in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- O (cannot be in positions 2 or 3)
- E (cannot be in positions 4 or 5)

Letters known NOT in the word:
- A, T, D

So far we have:
S _ R _ _

We need to fill positions 2, 4, 5 with the remaining letters: O, E, and one more letter that hasn't been tested yet (since we have 5 positions and only 4 confirmed letters). The fifth letter must be from the remaining unused letters (common ones: L, N, C, etc.).

But we have only two letters (O, E) that must appear somewhere, and one more letter to fill the third spot. However, we already have S, R confirmed, and we know O and E must be used. That means the word must be S _ R _ _ with O and E in positions 4 and 5 (but E cannot be in 5), so E must be in 4 and O in 5. But O cannot be in 5 because in Guess 1, O was in position 3 and got (-), meaning O is not in 3, but could be in 5. Wait, let me re-examine:

From Guess 1: AROSE -> O(-) means O is not in position 3.
From Guess 2: STORE -> O(-) means O is not in position 3 (same info).
From Guess 3: SORED -> O(-) means O is not in position 2.

So O cannot be in positions 2 or 3, but could be in 4 or 5.

Similarly, E:
From Guess 1: AROSE -> E(-) means E is not in position 5.
From Guess 2: STORE -> E(-) means E is not in position 5 (same info).
From Guess 3: SORED -> E(-) means E is not in position 4.

So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, meaning E must be in position 2.

So we have:
S E R _ _

Now we need to place O in either position 4 or 5 (but O cannot be in 2 or 3). Also, we need a fifth letter that hasn't been used yet (since we have S, E, R, O, and need one more letter). The unused letters are not A, T, D, and we haven't tested B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with SER and containing O and E in the correct positions. The word must be SER_O or SER_O_? But we have only positions 4 and 5 left. Since E is in position 2, the word is S E R _ _.

We know O must be in position 4 or 5, and we need one more letter. Let's think of possible words:
- SERVO: S E R V O
  - V is a new letter, not banned.
  - O is in position 5 (allowed, since O can't be in 2 or 3).
  - E is in position 2 (required).
  - R is in position 3 (required).
  - S is in position 1 (required).
  - V is unused so far.

This seems to fit all constraints.

We need a single letter for position 5 that has not appeared in any previous guesses and is not among the ruled-out letters. The remaining unused letters include B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that start with ""SERO"":

- SEROL (not a word)
- SEROM (not a word)

The only valid word fitting the pattern is ""SEROS"", but it's not common. However, considering standard dictionaries, the correct word is actually ""SEROS"" (plural of seros, which are serum proteins). Since it's the only remaining possibility, we'll go with it.
