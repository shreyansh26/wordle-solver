We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓
- R: -
- A: x
- N: x
- E: -

Interpretation:
- C is correct and in the right position (position 1). So the secret word starts with C.
- R is in the word but not in position 2. So R is somewhere else in the word.
- A is not in the word at all.
- N is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed in the last position).

Therefore, the secret word:
- Starts with C.
- Contains R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively (and also not A or N).
- R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

We have 5 positions: 1: C (fixed), 2: ? (not R, not A, not N), 3: ?, 4: ?, 5: ? (not E).

Letters known to be in the word: C, R, E (C is fixed at position 1).

Letters not in the word: A, N.

Since E is in the word but not at position 5, it must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4. But note that position 2 cannot be E because the feedback for R was that it's in the word but not in position 2, but it doesn't restrict E. However, we don't know if E can be in position 2 yet.

Similarly, R must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is not R).

We need to make a second guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word starting with C (since position 1 must be C).
- Does not contain A or N (since they are not in the word).
- Must include R and E (because we know they are in the word), but we don't know their positions yet.

We also want to test possible positions for R and E, and perhaps get information about the other letters.

Possible structure for the second guess:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: Some letter that is not A, N (and not R because R can't be there), but we don't know what is allowed. We can choose a common consonant.
- We need to include R and E in positions 3,4, or 5 (but not necessarily both; we already know they are in the word, so we must include them to check positions).

Alternatively, we can try to place R and E in different positions to test.

But note: We cannot reuse A or N, so our word must consist of letters excluding A and N.

List of possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we know the word has R and E).

We must include R and E in the word, but avoid A and N.

Additionally, we want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Let me think of words that start with C, contain R and E, and no A or N.

Some options:
- ""CREPT"": C, R, E, P, T -> but E in position 3? We don't know.
- ""CRWTH"" - not a common word.
- ""CREST"": C, R, E, S, T -> this is common. Let's check: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:E, 4:S, 5:T.

But note: Feedback for first guess said R is not in position 2. So if we guess ""CREST"", R is in position 2. But wait, in the secret word, R is not in position 2. So if we guess ""CREST"", we expect that R in position 2 would be marked as wrong (either '-' or 'x')? Actually, since we know R is in the word but not position 2, if we put R in position 2 we'll get a '-' for R (meaning it's in the word but wrong position), but we already know that.

Alternatively, we can avoid putting R in position 2 since we know it's incorrect, so that we can test other positions.

But let's see: if we guess ""CREST"", we place R in position 2 (which we know is wrong) and E in position 3.

If the secret word has E in position 3, then we get a ✓ for E at position 3. Otherwise, we might get a '-' if E is in the word but not position 3, or 'x' but we know E is in the word so it can't be 'x'.

Actually, we know E is in the word, so if E is not in position 3, we get '-'.

Similarly, for R: we know R is in the word, and if we put it in position 2, we'll get '-' because we know it's not position 2.

But we can also try to place R in a different position.

Another idea: place R in position 3 or 4 or 5 to see if it gets ✓.

For example, let's try to make a word with C at 1, E at 2 (but is E allowed at position 2? We don't know yet), and R at 3,4 or 5.

We need to consider: the feedback told us E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 2,3, or 4.

Similarly, R can be at position 3,4, or 5.

So, let's choose a word that places E in a new position, say position 2, and R in position 3,4, or 5.

But note: the secret word has 5 letters and we know C (position1), R, E, and two more letters.

We don't know the other two letters.

Word: ""CEDAR"" - but we cannot use A (since A is not in the word), so avoid A.

Word: ""CHERT"" - C, H, E, R, T -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:R, 5:T.

That might be a good one: it avoids position 2 for R (we put R at 4) and E at position 3. Also, we test H and T.

Another option: ""CREPT"" - C, R, E, P, T -> but R is at position 2? We know R is not at position 2, so putting R at position 2 would be a waste because we know it's wrong.

So, let's avoid putting R in position 2.

Similarly, in ""CREST"", R is at position 2, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid that.

Better to try a word that has R in a different position.

Options:
- ""CERES"" - not a common word.
- ""CODER"" - C, O, D, E, R -> but E is at position 4 and R at position 5. Also, O, D are new.

But note: position 1 is C, position 2 is O, position 3 is D, position 4 is E, position 5 is R.

This places E at position 4 and R at position 5.

We know E is not at position 5, but can be at 4. Similarly, R not at 2, but can be at 5.

Also, we don't use A or N.

So, ""CODER"" is a valid word? Yes, in programming, but also in English as a noun (one who codes). However, it might be accepted.

But perhaps we can choose a more common word.

Another word: ""CUTER"" - C, U, T, E, R -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R.

This also avoids position 2 for R and position 5 for E (E is at position 4, R at position 5).

But we don't know if E can be at position 4 or R at position 5.

I think ""CUTER"" is acceptable.

But we also want to cover other common letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""CRUEL"": C, R, U, E, L -> but R is at position 2? No, if we structure it as 1:C, 2:R? Bad, because we know R is not at position 2.

We need to avoid position 2 for R.

How about ""CLERK"": C, L, E, R, K -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:R, 5:K.

This places E at position 3 and R at position 4.

And L and K are new.

This seems good because:
- Position 1: C (we know correct)
- Position 2: L (new)
- Position 3: E (if E is at position 3, we get ✓, if not we get '-' or ... but since E is in the word, it will be '-' if not at position 3)
- Position 4: R (if R is at position 4, we get ✓, else if R is elsewhere, we get '-')
- Position 5: K (new)

Also, no A, N.

Moreover, ""CLERK"" is a common word.

So, I think ""CLERK"" is a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""CRIMP"" - but R is at position 2? Avoid.

""CREME"" - but E repeated? And R at position 2? Avoid.

""COVER"" - C, O, V, E, R -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R -> same as before.

But ""CLERK"" is fine.

I'll go with ""CLERK"".

So, second guess: ""CLERK""

But note: we have to return it in the specified format.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in the right position (✓ at position 1), so the secret word starts with ""C"".
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is not in the word (x), so it can be excluded.
- N is not in the word (x), so it can be excluded.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
- The word starts with ""C"".
- The word contains ""R"" and ""E"", which must be placed in positions other than the ones guessed: R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
- A and N are not in the word, so the second guess must avoid these letters.

Since R and E could be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (with position 5 excluded for E), a strong second guess should:
- Start with ""C"".
- Include both ""R"" and ""E"" to test their possible positions.
- Avoid A and N.
- Use common letters to maximize information.

""CLERK"" is a good candidate:
- Position 1: C (fixed and correct).
- Position 2: L (new letter to test).
- Position 3: E (tests if E is in position 3).
- Position 4: R (tests if R is in position 4).
- Position 5: K (new letter to test).

This avoids known incorrect positions for R and E while covering new consonants like L and K.

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓
- R: -
- A: x
- N: x
- E: -

Interpretation:
- C is correct and in the right position (position 1). So the secret word starts with C.
- R is in the word but not in position 2. So R is somewhere else in the word.
- A is not in the word at all.
- N is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed in the last position).

Therefore, the secret word:
- Starts with C.
- Contains R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively (and also not A or N).
- R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

We have 5 positions: 1: C (fixed), 2: ? (not R, not A, not N), 3: ?, 4: ?, 5: ? (not E).

Letters known to be in the word: C, R, E (C is fixed at position 1).

Letters not in the word: A, N.

Since E is in the word but not at position 5, it must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4. But note that position 2 cannot be E because the feedback for R was that it's in the word but not in position 2, but it doesn't restrict E. However, we don't know if E can be in position 2 yet.

Similarly, R must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is not R).

We need to make a second guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word starting with C (since position 1 must be C).
- Does not contain A or N (since they are not in the word).
- Must include R and E (because we know they are in the word), but we don't know their positions yet.

We also want to test possible positions for R and E, and perhaps get information about the other letters.

Possible structure for the second guess:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: Some letter that is not A, N (and not R because R can't be there), but we don't know what is allowed. We can choose a common consonant.
- We need to include R and E in positions 3,4, or 5 (but not necessarily both; we already know they are in the word, so we must include them to check positions).

Alternatively, we can try to place R and E in different positions to test.

But note: We cannot reuse A or N, so our word must consist of letters excluding A and N.

List of possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we know the word has R and E).

We must include R and E in the word, but avoid A and N.

Additionally, we want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Let me think of words that start with C, contain R and E, and no A or N.

Some options:
- ""CREPT"": C, R, E, P, T -> but E in position 3? We don't know.
- ""CRWTH"" - not a common word.
- ""CREST"": C, R, E, S, T -> this is common. Let's check: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:E, 4:S, 5:T.

But note: Feedback for first guess said R is not in position 2. So if we guess ""CREST"", R is in position 2. But wait, in the secret word, R is not in position 2. So if we guess ""CREST"", we expect that R in position 2 would be marked as wrong (either '-' or 'x')? Actually, since we know R is in the word but not position 2, if we put R in position 2 we'll get a '-' for R (meaning it's in the word but wrong position), but we already know that.

Alternatively, we can avoid putting R in position 2 since we know it's incorrect, so that we can test other positions.

But let's see: if we guess ""CREST"", we place R in position 2 (which we know is wrong) and E in position 3.

If the secret word has E in position 3, then we get a ✓ for E at position 3. Otherwise, we might get a '-' if E is in the word but not position 3, or 'x' but we know E is in the word so it can't be 'x'.

Actually, we know E is in the word, so if E is not in position 3, we get '-'.

Similarly, for R: we know R is in the word, and if we put it in position 2, we'll get '-' because we know it's not position 2.

But we can also try to place R in a different position.

Another idea: place R in position 3 or 4 or 5 to see if it gets ✓.

For example, let's try to make a word with C at 1, E at 2 (but is E allowed at position 2? We don't know yet), and R at 3,4 or 5.

We need to consider: the feedback told us E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 2,3, or 4.

Similarly, R can be at position 3,4, or 5.

So, let's choose a word that places E in a new position, say position 2, and R in position 3,4, or 5.

But note: the secret word has 5 letters and we know C (position1), R, E, and two more letters.

We don't know the other two letters.

Word: ""CEDAR"" - but we cannot use A (since A is not in the word), so avoid A.

Word: ""CHERT"" - C, H, E, R, T -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:R, 5:T.

That might be a good one: it avoids position 2 for R (we put R at 4) and E at position 3. Also, we test H and T.

Another option: ""CREPT"" - C, R, E, P, T -> but R is at position 2? We know R is not at position 2, so putting R at position 2 would be a waste because we know it's wrong.

So, let's avoid putting R in position 2.

Similarly, in ""CREST"", R is at position 2, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid that.

Better to try a word that has R in a different position.

Options:
- ""CERES"" - not a common word.
- ""CODER"" - C, O, D, E, R -> but E is at position 4 and R at position 5. Also, O, D are new.

But note: position 1 is C, position 2 is O, position 3 is D, position 4 is E, position 5 is R.

This places E at position 4 and R at position 5.

We know E is not at position 5, but can be at 4. Similarly, R not at 2, but can be at 5.

Also, we don't use A or N.

So, ""CODER"" is a valid word? Yes, in programming, but also in English as a noun (one who codes). However, it might be accepted.

But perhaps we can choose a more common word.

Another word: ""CUTER"" - C, U, T, E, R -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R.

This also avoids position 2 for R and position 5 for E (E is at position 4, R at position 5).

But we don't know if E can be at position 4 or R at position 5.

I think ""CUTER"" is acceptable.

But we also want to cover other common letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""CRUEL"": C, R, U, E, L -> but R is at position 2? No, if we structure it as 1:C, 2:R? Bad, because we know R is not at position 2.

We need to avoid position 2 for R.

How about ""CLERK"": C, L, E, R, K -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:R, 5:K.

This places E at position 3 and R at position 4.

And L and K are new.

This seems good because:
- Position 1: C (we know correct)
- Position 2: L (new)
- Position 3: E (if E is at position 3, we get ✓, if not we get '-' or ... but since E is in the word, it will be '-' if not at position 3)
- Position 4: R (if R is at position 4, we get ✓, else if R is elsewhere, we get '-')
- Position 5: K (new)

Also, no A, N.

Moreover, ""CLERK"" is a common word.

So, I think ""CLERK"" is a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""CRIMP"" - but R is at position 2? Avoid.

""CREME"" - but E repeated? And R at position 2? Avoid.

""COVER"" - C, O, V, E, R -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R -> same as before.

But ""CLERK"" is fine.

I'll go with ""CLERK"".

So, second guess: ""CLERK""

But note: we have to return it in the specified format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in the right position (✓ at position 1), so the secret word starts with ""C"".
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is not in the word (x), so it can be excluded.
- N is not in the word (x), so it can be excluded.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
- The word starts with ""C"".
- The word contains ""R"" and ""E"", which must be placed in positions other than the ones guessed: R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
- A and N are not in the word, so the second guess must avoid these letters.

Since R and E could be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (with position 5 excluded for E), a strong second guess should:
- Start with ""C"".
- Include both ""R"" and ""E"" to test their possible positions.
- Avoid A and N.
- Use common letters to maximize information.

""CLERK"" is a good candidate:
- Position 1: C (fixed and correct).
- Position 2: L (new letter to test).
- Position 3: E (tests if E is in position 3).
- Position 4: R (tests if R is in position 4).
- Position 5: K (new letter to test).

This avoids known incorrect positions for R and E while covering new consonants like L and K.

We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Second guess: ""clerK"" (capital K for emphasis, but it's a letter)
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- L: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- K: x (not in word)

From this, we know:

1. The word starts with C (position 1 is fixed).
2. The letters R and E are in the word, but neither was in their guessed positions:
   - In ""crane"", R was guessed in position 2 and E in position 5; both were marked wrong position.
   - In ""clerk"", E was guessed in position 3 and R in position 4; both were marked wrong position.

So we can deduce:
- R is not in positions 2, 3, or 4? Wait, no: we only know it's not in pos 2 (from guess1) and not in pos 4 (from guess2), and it might be in pos 3 or 5? But guess2 had R in pos 4, so it's not pos 4. And guess1 had R in pos 2, not pos 2. But we haven't tested pos 5 for R? So R could be in position 3 or 5? However, we don't have information about position 3 for R because in guess2 we tested E in position 3, not R.

Similarly for E:
- E is not in pos 5 (guess1) and not in pos 3 (guess2) because guess2 had E in pos3 and it was marked as '-', meaning it's not pos3. So E cannot be in positions 3 or 5? And we haven't tested position 2 for E? So possible positions for E are 2 or 4? And for R: we know not pos2 (guess1) and not pos4 (guess2), so R must be in pos3 (since pos1 is C) or pos5? But note: the secret word has exactly 5 positions.

Potential positions for R: 3 or 5? (because 2 and 4 are excluded)
But: position 1 is C, so R cannot be there.

Also, we know E is in the word but not pos3 or pos5? So E must be in pos2 or pos4.

Now, letters we have excluded from the word:
- A (from guess1)
- N (from guess1)
- L (from guess2)
- K (from guess2)

So the word contains:
- C (fixed at pos1)
- R
- E
- plus two other letters that are not A, N, L, or K.

Now, we have two unknowns: the two letters and the positions of R and E.

But note: we cannot have R and E in positions that are already excluded.

Possible configurations:

Let the word be: C _ _ _ _

Position 2: Either E or one of the other letters. But E can be pos2? We haven't tested pos2 for E? Actually, we have not guessed E in pos2 yet.

Similarly, position 3: we have not tested for R? But we tested for E in pos3 and it was wrong. But R could be in pos3? Yes.

Position 4: we tested R in pos4 and it was wrong, so R not at pos4.

Position 5: we tested E in pos5 and it was wrong? So E cannot be pos5.

Therefore:
- R must be in position 3 or 5? Because pos2 and pos4 are invalid for R.
- E must be in position 2 or 4? Because pos3 and pos5 are invalid for E.

But note: if R is in pos3, E could be pos2 or pos4. Similarly, if R is in pos5, E could be pos2 or pos4.

However, the position constraints must be considered with the rest of the word.

We also need to choose a third guess that uses the known information and gives us more clues.

We must avoid letters L, K, A, N.

We must include R and E? No, we already know they are in the word, so our guess must include them? Not necessarily, but we have only 6 guesses and we need to solve, so guessing a word without R or E would be bad because we won't get information about the positions? Or we might not include them to test other letters? But since we have limited guesses, it's better to include the known letters to confirm their positions? However, we know R and E are in the word, so we can try to place them in the possible positions that remain.

Possible positions for E: 2 or 4.
Possible positions for R: 3 or 5.

So that gives us four cases:

Case 1: E at 2, R at 3 -> word: C E R ? ?
Case 2: E at 2, R at 5 -> word: C E ? ? R
Case 3: E at 4, R at 3 -> word: C ? R E ?
Case 4: E at 4, R at 5 -> word: C ? ? E R

But each of these has two more letters to be determined? We have positions to fill.

For each case, we need a guess that fits one of these patterns? Or we can make a guess that tests one of these possibilities.

However, our guess must be a valid English word.

We also have to use letters that have not been eliminated: so letters excluding A, N, L, K.

But note: we haven't used many letters? We have used C, R, A, N, E, L, K? And the word must have two more letters? Unknown.

In guess1: ""crane"" letters: C,R,A,N,E
In guess2: ""clerk"": C,L,E,R,K

So covered letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, K

Eliminated letters: A, N, L, K

So remaining letters: all English vowels and consonants except A,N,L,K.

We should focus on common remaining letters: maybe vowels O, U? Or consonants B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But no A or N or L or K? So L and K are out? But in first guess E was present? And R.

Actually E and R are in, and C is fixed.

So for the word we need: starting with C, contains E and R (and E and R positions constrained), and two other letters from the remaining set of letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But specifically: avoid A, N, L, K.

Now, we can design a guess that fits one of the cases? Or tests multiple possibilities.

But note: if we guess a word with E in position 2, we can see if E is indeed in pos2? Similarly for R.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that places E in one of its possible positions and R in one of its, and also uses new letters to test.

But we have only one more guess to get information?

We need to cover more letters? Or constrain possibilities.

What are common words to guess?

First, let's list possible positions:

If we assume case 1: word like C E R _ _
What can fit? E.g., ""CERTS"" or ""CERTY""? Not valid? ""CERES"" not common? ""CERV""? Not 5.

But ""CERTY"" is not a word? ""CERTS"" no? ""CERT"" is 4; need 5 letters.

Actually, valid English words: ""CERTy"" -> ""CERTY"" is not standard? But ""CERTY"" no? Let me think: ""CERTS"" is not a common word? Better: ""CERED""? Not valid.

Instead, let's consider case 3 or case 4? What words exist?

Case 3: word C _ R E _
Possible: ""CURED"" (C _ R E _) -> positions:2:U, 5:D? But D is allowed? No A,N,L,K.
But ""CURED"" would be: position1:C, position2:U, position3:R, position4:E, position5:D.
In this case: U, R, E, D? But R is at position3? We have? U and E,D? But E at position4.

Now check against known: 
If secret word were ""CURED"":
- For guess1 ""crane"": position1: C? Yes and ✓? No: ""crane"" has C at1: ✓. R at2: secret has R at3? So R at2 not same? So R: in word, wrong position? That matches -. A at3: secret has U? So not A? A x matches? N at4: secret has E? So not N x? E at5: secret has D? So E? Secret has E at4? So E at5 is not correct? And E is in word? So E: -? Matches.

Guess2: ""clerk"": C ✓ L: secret has U? Not L? L x? E: at position3? Secret has E at4? So E in word wrong position? Hence -? R at position4? Secret has R at3? So R at4 is wrong? Hence -? K at5: secret has D? So K x? Matches the feedback? So ""CURED"" is entirely possible? 

But note: in guess2 we guessed ""clerk"" and got E at position3: -, but secret has E at position4? So indeed, E was guessed in pos3 (wrong) and R in pos4 (wrong)? And R is at pos3? So in guess2, we didn't have R at position3? We had R at position4? So position3 was E? And result was E: -? Because E is not at pos3? Correct.

Similarly, case 1: C E R _ _ 
What word? ""CERTs""? No? ""CERVS""? No? ""CERSE""? Not common? ""CERES"" is a name? Not common? ""CERTY"" not a word?

Another possibility: ""CERO""? Not 5 letters.

Case 2: C E _ _ R
Examples: ""CENTER""? Not because it has T,E,N? N is excluded? But N is not in? We have to avoid N? So ""CETER""? No? ""CEDER""? E? But E at position2, R at position5? ""CEDER"": C E D E R? But E at position2 and position4? Secret word could have two E's? But the feedback doesn't tell us duplicates? We don't know? Actually, we aren't told about duplicate letters? In feedback, if a letter appears in the secret multiple times? But let me check: in guess2 ""clerk"": we used E once? And got E:-, meaning E is not in position3? But if secret had two E's, then if E in position3 absent? But E might appear elsewhere? But generally, no indication? So possibility.

But ""CEDER"" is not common? ""CEDAR"" excluded because A? A is out? So no.

""CEILR""? Not English? Better: ""CELLR""? No? Not good.

Case 4: C _ _ E R
Examples: ""CATER"" -> C A T E R? But A is excluded? Cannot use A? ""COMER""? C O M E R? That could be? Avoid A,N,L,K? Yes? Also ""COVER"", ""COWER"", etc.

But we have case 3: C _ R E _ -> like ""CURED"", ""CRIED"", etc.

And our guess2 eliminated L and K? So we can form words with other letters.

But to get information faster, we should guess a word that will test the positions for E and R and also use new common letters? Also, we want to use letters that haven't been used? To see if they appear.

For example, we can guess a word that places E at position 2 and R at position 5? Or position3? Etc? But because of constraints?

Best: try to guess a word that fits Case 3 or Case 4? But we don't know which? So choose a guess that will distinguish? Or cover.

Proposal: guess a word that has E at position 2 (to test if E is at position 2) and R at one of its possible positions? Also? And new letters.

For example, let's try ""CATER"": but A excluded? Not possible? Avoid A.

So ""COMER""? But it might not be common? ""CODER""? D, O? But in guess2 we didn't have O or D? So ""CODER"": C O D E R -> E at position4? Not position2? Wait, position2 is O? Position4 is E.

If E is in position2? Then we need a word like ""C E _ _ _"".

For example, ""CEBID""? Not common? ""CEDAR"" excluded? ""CEILI""? No? ""CELLO"": C E L L O? But we know L is not in the word! Because in guess2, L was at position2? Eliminated with x? So if L is eliminated, we cannot use L? So ""CELLO"" is invalid? Cannot have L. Similarly, K is eliminated.

So we must avoid L.

Possible word with E in position2: ""CEASE""? But A and E? A is out? ""CEASE"" has A? No? If we avoid A? ""CEILI""? No? ""CENSE""? But N is out? ""CEORL""? Not English? This is hard.

Alternative: ""CEMENT"": too long? No, 5 letters? ""CEMENT"" is 6? Not. How about ""CERES""? Not common.

Perhaps it's easier to test the other position? Place E at position4 and R at position5? Since R cannot be position3? Or test E at position4.

Similarly, we can choose a word that fits Case 4: C _ _ E R? Like ""COWER"", ""COVER"", ""COMER"".

Or Case 3: C _ R E D? Like ""CURED"", ""CRIED"", ""CROME"" not? ""CRUEL""? But L is out? So L not allowed? ""CRUEL"" has L? Avoid.

Words for Case 3: C _ R E _ 
Valid English words without L, K, A, N: ""CREDO""? ""CREDO"" is C R E D O -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:E, 4:D, 5:O? But wait, R at position2? We know R cannot be in position2! From guess1? Guess1: R in pos2 was marked wrong? So secret R not position2? Therefore in ""CREDO"", R is at position2? Not allowed? So words for Case 3 must have R at position3? As in C ? R E ?

So: position 2 must be one letter, R at position3, E at position4? Then position5? 

Possible: ""C U R E D"" -> ""CURED"" (as I thought earlier)
Or ""C I R E D""? ""CIRED"" not a word?
Or ""C A R E D""? A excluded? Cannot use A.
Or ""C O R E D"" -> ""CORED""
Or ""C T R E D""? Not common.
Or ""C H R E W""? ""CHREW"" not word.
Best: ""CORED"" or ""CURED""? Both valid?

Similarly for Case 4: C ? ? E R -> ""COPER"", ""COVER"", ""COWER"", ""CAVER"" A? Excluded? Or ""CITER""?

Back to our guess: we need to make a third guess that tests some of these.

A good approach: we can guess ""CORED"": ""CORED"" means C O R E D? But positions: 
1:C (fixed), 2:O, 3:R, 4:E, 5:D

Check constraints:
For E: if the secret has E in position4, then we get it? And for R in position3? Similarly? Also, we can get new information? 

But wait, we know E cannot be in position3? From guess2? Guess2 ""clerk"" had E at position3, marked -, so E not position3? Similarly, E not position5? So E must be pos2 or pos4? In ""CORED"", E is at position4.

And R: we know not position2? And not position4? So R in position3? That fits? Because in ""CORED"", R is at position3? 

So if secret has R at position3? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if R is not at position3, then we get '-'. But note, R must be in position3 or position5? So if R not at3, it must be at5? 

Similarly, for E: if E at position4? Then ✓? Else, if E at position2, then we get '-'? 

But secret word: if it has E at position4 and R at position3? Then ""CORED"" is a candidate? 

Similarly, ""CURED"" is another? Both have R at position3.

But what if R is at position5? For example, secret word ""C O V E R"" -> ""COVER"", then R is at position5? 

When we guess ""CORED"": 
If secret is ""COVER"", then we get:
Position1: C ✓
Position2: O? Secret position2: V? Not O? But O might be absent? So:
- Position1: C ✓ 
- Position2: O: ? secret has O? ""COVER"" does not have O? So O would be marked x? 
- Position3: R: secret has R at position5? So R is in word? But position3: secret has V? Not R? So R: -
- Position4: E: secret position4: E? So ✓ 
- Position5: D? Secret position5: R? Not D? So D: x

And if secret is ""CURED"": 
- Position1: C ✓ 
- Position2: O? Secret position2: U? Not O? So O: ?
- Position3: R: secret position3: R? So ✓ 
- Position4: E: secret position4: E? ✓ 
- Position5: D: secret position5: D? ✓ 

Only if both R and E positions match? 

But if secret is ""COVER"" (with R at5), then R at3 in ""CORED"" would get '-'.

We have also other possibilities.

To get more letters, we can guess ""CORED"".

Another candidate: ""COWER"" or ""COVER""? But ""COVER"" does not have R at position3? 

Perhaps we can also guess ""CUTER"": C U T E R? But E at position4? R at position5? So positions: 
1:C, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R

And we haven't used U, T? 

In guess2 we had ""clerk"", E was at3? Not E at4.

Potential: 
If secret E at position4? Then we get ✓? 
If secret R at position5? Then we get ✓?

But what if secret E at position2? Then E at position4 in guess would get '-', etc.

Also, T and U are new letters.

But ""CUTER"" might not be common? But accepted as a word.

Let's choose: ""CURED"" is a possible word? We can guess it? But it might be the answer? So if we guess and it's wrong, we get feed? 

Better to guess a word with new letters? 

""SCARE""? Starts with S? Cannot? Position1 must be C? Fixed? No? Start must be C? Because we have C at1 fixed? So all guesses must start with C? Because position1 is C? Yes.

So every guess must start with C? Because it will be ✓ if correct? And we know it is? 

Therefore, guess starts with C? Must: C _ _ _ _

Now, with the constraints, let me design a guess.

Consider placing E at position4? To see if E is at that position? Similarly, place R at position? We can't place R at position5 because we haven't tested? Or place R at position3? Which is one option.

If we place R at position5? Then we get: if secret R at position5, ✓, else - if R at position3? But R at position3 or5? If not at5, must be at3? So we can get info? 

Similarly, place E at position2? So guess: C E ? ? R? But what letters? With avoid L,K,A,N? And the ? can be any letters.

But to have a valid word? Like ""C E D A R"" has A? Excluded? ""C E I L R""? L excluded? ""C E M E R""? Could be ""CEMER""? Not common? ""CEORL""? Not.

Perhaps ""C E T Y R""? Not word? Not easy? 

So maybe placing E at position4 is feasible? 

Guess: ""COVER"" -> C O V E R? 
Positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R

Now, this:
- Tests E at position4? If E is at pos4, we get ✓? Else if E is at pos2, then E at4 will be -
- Tests R at position5? If R at5, ✓? Else if R at3, then R at5 will be -? Because R is still in the word.

Also, introduces O, V as new letters? If any of them are in the word? We can get feedback.

So I think ""COVER"" is a good guess? 

Another possibility: ""CUTER""? C U T E R? Same structure? E at4? R at5? 

""COVER"" is more common? 

Also, ""COMER"" is less common? 

But we must check if it fits: in ""COVER"", E at position4 and R at position5? Which are possible? 

If the secret word has E at position4 and R at position5? Then we get all? ✓? 

If not, we get partial.

Also, the word might be? 

Since we have used O and V? Or not? 

So for guess3, I choose ""COVER"".

Let's see what happens if secret has E at position2? For example, secret word ""CE R something?""? But we cannot find words? 

But if secret is ""C E R T S""? But not a word? Or ""C E R G E""? Not 5 letters? So E at position2? R at position3? Then position4 and 5 need letters? E.g., ""CERNE""? Not? ""CERED""? Not? ""CEBID""? Not common? 

Similarly, E at position2 and R at position5: ""CELER""? L excluded? ""CEDER""? Not A? ""CETYL""? Not common? I think E at position2 might be less common? Plus, we haven't tested position2 with E? So by placing E in position4, we can test position4? 

Similarly, R in position5.

So ""COVER"" is suitable.

Therefore, our third guess will be ""COVER"".

<guess>cover</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** C(✓), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - This indicates that ""C"" is correct and in position 1.
  - ""R"" and ""E"" are in the word but not in positions 2 and 5, respectively.
  - ""A"" and ""N"" are not in the word and can be excluded.

- **Guess 2 (""clerk""):** C(✓), L(x), E(-), R(-), K(x)
  - This confirms ""C"" is fixed at position 1.
  - ""E"" is in the word but not in position 3 (since E at position 3 was marked wrong).
  - ""R"" is in the word but not in position 4 (since R at position 4 was marked wrong).
  - ""L"" and ""K"" are not in the word and can be excluded.

Key deductions:
- Position 1: Must be ""C"".
- Possible positions for ""E"": Positions 2 or 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).
- Possible positions for ""R"": Positions 3 or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).
- Eliminated letters: A, N, L, K. Any new guess must avoid these.
- The word must include ""R"" and ""E"", and two unknown letters from the remaining English alphabet (excluding A, N, L, K).

For the third guess, choose a word that:
- Starts with ""C"".
- Places ""E"" in position 4 (to test for E at position 4) and ""R"" in position 5 (to test for R at position 5).
- Introduces new common letters to gather more information.
- Avoids eliminated letters (A, N, L, K).

""COVER"" fits these requirements:
- C (position 1): Known correct.
- O (position 2): New letter (untested vowel).
- V (position 3): New letter (common consonant).
- E (position 4): Tests if E is in position 4.
- R (position 5): Tests if R is in position 5.

This guess will provide feedback to narrow down the positions of E and R and reveal if O or V are in the word.

<guess>cover</guess>",cover,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Second guess: ""clerK"" (capital K for emphasis, but it's a letter)
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- L: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- K: x (not in word)

From this, we know:

1. The word starts with C (position 1 is fixed).
2. The letters R and E are in the word, but neither was in their guessed positions:
   - In ""crane"", R was guessed in position 2 and E in position 5; both were marked wrong position.
   - In ""clerk"", E was guessed in position 3 and R in position 4; both were marked wrong position.

So we can deduce:
- R is not in positions 2, 3, or 4? Wait, no: we only know it's not in pos 2 (from guess1) and not in pos 4 (from guess2), and it might be in pos 3 or 5? But guess2 had R in pos 4, so it's not pos 4. And guess1 had R in pos 2, not pos 2. But we haven't tested pos 5 for R? So R could be in position 3 or 5? However, we don't have information about position 3 for R because in guess2 we tested E in position 3, not R.

Similarly for E:
- E is not in pos 5 (guess1) and not in pos 3 (guess2) because guess2 had E in pos3 and it was marked as '-', meaning it's not pos3. So E cannot be in positions 3 or 5? And we haven't tested position 2 for E? So possible positions for E are 2 or 4? And for R: we know not pos2 (guess1) and not pos4 (guess2), so R must be in pos3 (since pos1 is C) or pos5? But note: the secret word has exactly 5 positions.

Potential positions for R: 3 or 5? (because 2 and 4 are excluded)
But: position 1 is C, so R cannot be there.

Also, we know E is in the word but not pos3 or pos5? So E must be in pos2 or pos4.

Now, letters we have excluded from the word:
- A (from guess1)
- N (from guess1)
- L (from guess2)
- K (from guess2)

So the word contains:
- C (fixed at pos1)
- R
- E
- plus two other letters that are not A, N, L, or K.

Now, we have two unknowns: the two letters and the positions of R and E.

But note: we cannot have R and E in positions that are already excluded.

Possible configurations:

Let the word be: C _ _ _ _

Position 2: Either E or one of the other letters. But E can be pos2? We haven't tested pos2 for E? Actually, we have not guessed E in pos2 yet.

Similarly, position 3: we have not tested for R? But we tested for E in pos3 and it was wrong. But R could be in pos3? Yes.

Position 4: we tested R in pos4 and it was wrong, so R not at pos4.

Position 5: we tested E in pos5 and it was wrong? So E cannot be pos5.

Therefore:
- R must be in position 3 or 5? Because pos2 and pos4 are invalid for R.
- E must be in position 2 or 4? Because pos3 and pos5 are invalid for E.

But note: if R is in pos3, E could be pos2 or pos4. Similarly, if R is in pos5, E could be pos2 or pos4.

However, the position constraints must be considered with the rest of the word.

We also need to choose a third guess that uses the known information and gives us more clues.

We must avoid letters L, K, A, N.

We must include R and E? No, we already know they are in the word, so our guess must include them? Not necessarily, but we have only 6 guesses and we need to solve, so guessing a word without R or E would be bad because we won't get information about the positions? Or we might not include them to test other letters? But since we have limited guesses, it's better to include the known letters to confirm their positions? However, we know R and E are in the word, so we can try to place them in the possible positions that remain.

Possible positions for E: 2 or 4.
Possible positions for R: 3 or 5.

So that gives us four cases:

Case 1: E at 2, R at 3 -> word: C E R ? ?
Case 2: E at 2, R at 5 -> word: C E ? ? R
Case 3: E at 4, R at 3 -> word: C ? R E ?
Case 4: E at 4, R at 5 -> word: C ? ? E R

But each of these has two more letters to be determined? We have positions to fill.

For each case, we need a guess that fits one of these patterns? Or we can make a guess that tests one of these possibilities.

However, our guess must be a valid English word.

We also have to use letters that have not been eliminated: so letters excluding A, N, L, K.

But note: we haven't used many letters? We have used C, R, A, N, E, L, K? And the word must have two more letters? Unknown.

In guess1: ""crane"" letters: C,R,A,N,E
In guess2: ""clerk"": C,L,E,R,K

So covered letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, K

Eliminated letters: A, N, L, K

So remaining letters: all English vowels and consonants except A,N,L,K.

We should focus on common remaining letters: maybe vowels O, U? Or consonants B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But no A or N or L or K? So L and K are out? But in first guess E was present? And R.

Actually E and R are in, and C is fixed.

So for the word we need: starting with C, contains E and R (and E and R positions constrained), and two other letters from the remaining set of letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But specifically: avoid A, N, L, K.

Now, we can design a guess that fits one of the cases? Or tests multiple possibilities.

But note: if we guess a word with E in position 2, we can see if E is indeed in pos2? Similarly for R.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that places E in one of its possible positions and R in one of its, and also uses new letters to test.

But we have only one more guess to get information?

We need to cover more letters? Or constrain possibilities.

What are common words to guess?

First, let's list possible positions:

If we assume case 1: word like C E R _ _
What can fit? E.g., ""CERTS"" or ""CERTY""? Not valid? ""CERES"" not common? ""CERV""? Not 5.

But ""CERTY"" is not a word? ""CERTS"" no? ""CERT"" is 4; need 5 letters.

Actually, valid English words: ""CERTy"" -> ""CERTY"" is not standard? But ""CERTY"" no? Let me think: ""CERTS"" is not a common word? Better: ""CERED""? Not valid.

Instead, let's consider case 3 or case 4? What words exist?

Case 3: word C _ R E _
Possible: ""CURED"" (C _ R E _) -> positions:2:U, 5:D? But D is allowed? No A,N,L,K.
But ""CURED"" would be: position1:C, position2:U, position3:R, position4:E, position5:D.
In this case: U, R, E, D? But R is at position3? We have? U and E,D? But E at position4.

Now check against known: 
If secret word were ""CURED"":
- For guess1 ""crane"": position1: C? Yes and ✓? No: ""crane"" has C at1: ✓. R at2: secret has R at3? So R at2 not same? So R: in word, wrong position? That matches -. A at3: secret has U? So not A? A x matches? N at4: secret has E? So not N x? E at5: secret has D? So E? Secret has E at4? So E at5 is not correct? And E is in word? So E: -? Matches.

Guess2: ""clerk"": C ✓ L: secret has U? Not L? L x? E: at position3? Secret has E at4? So E in word wrong position? Hence -? R at position4? Secret has R at3? So R at4 is wrong? Hence -? K at5: secret has D? So K x? Matches the feedback? So ""CURED"" is entirely possible? 

But note: in guess2 we guessed ""clerk"" and got E at position3: -, but secret has E at position4? So indeed, E was guessed in pos3 (wrong) and R in pos4 (wrong)? And R is at pos3? So in guess2, we didn't have R at position3? We had R at position4? So position3 was E? And result was E: -? Because E is not at pos3? Correct.

Similarly, case 1: C E R _ _ 
What word? ""CERTs""? No? ""CERVS""? No? ""CERSE""? Not common? ""CERES"" is a name? Not common? ""CERTY"" not a word?

Another possibility: ""CERO""? Not 5 letters.

Case 2: C E _ _ R
Examples: ""CENTER""? Not because it has T,E,N? N is excluded? But N is not in? We have to avoid N? So ""CETER""? No? ""CEDER""? E? But E at position2, R at position5? ""CEDER"": C E D E R? But E at position2 and position4? Secret word could have two E's? But the feedback doesn't tell us duplicates? We don't know? Actually, we aren't told about duplicate letters? In feedback, if a letter appears in the secret multiple times? But let me check: in guess2 ""clerk"": we used E once? And got E:-, meaning E is not in position3? But if secret had two E's, then if E in position3 absent? But E might appear elsewhere? But generally, no indication? So possibility.

But ""CEDER"" is not common? ""CEDAR"" excluded because A? A is out? So no.

""CEILR""? Not English? Better: ""CELLR""? No? Not good.

Case 4: C _ _ E R
Examples: ""CATER"" -> C A T E R? But A is excluded? Cannot use A? ""COMER""? C O M E R? That could be? Avoid A,N,L,K? Yes? Also ""COVER"", ""COWER"", etc.

But we have case 3: C _ R E _ -> like ""CURED"", ""CRIED"", etc.

And our guess2 eliminated L and K? So we can form words with other letters.

But to get information faster, we should guess a word that will test the positions for E and R and also use new common letters? Also, we want to use letters that haven't been used? To see if they appear.

For example, we can guess a word that places E at position 2 and R at position 5? Or position3? Etc? But because of constraints?

Best: try to guess a word that fits Case 3 or Case 4? But we don't know which? So choose a guess that will distinguish? Or cover.

Proposal: guess a word that has E at position 2 (to test if E is at position 2) and R at one of its possible positions? Also? And new letters.

For example, let's try ""CATER"": but A excluded? Not possible? Avoid A.

So ""COMER""? But it might not be common? ""CODER""? D, O? But in guess2 we didn't have O or D? So ""CODER"": C O D E R -> E at position4? Not position2? Wait, position2 is O? Position4 is E.

If E is in position2? Then we need a word like ""C E _ _ _"".

For example, ""CEBID""? Not common? ""CEDAR"" excluded? ""CEILI""? No? ""CELLO"": C E L L O? But we know L is not in the word! Because in guess2, L was at position2? Eliminated with x? So if L is eliminated, we cannot use L? So ""CELLO"" is invalid? Cannot have L. Similarly, K is eliminated.

So we must avoid L.

Possible word with E in position2: ""CEASE""? But A and E? A is out? ""CEASE"" has A? No? If we avoid A? ""CEILI""? No? ""CENSE""? But N is out? ""CEORL""? Not English? This is hard.

Alternative: ""CEMENT"": too long? No, 5 letters? ""CEMENT"" is 6? Not. How about ""CERES""? Not common.

Perhaps it's easier to test the other position? Place E at position4 and R at position5? Since R cannot be position3? Or test E at position4.

Similarly, we can choose a word that fits Case 4: C _ _ E R? Like ""COWER"", ""COVER"", ""COMER"".

Or Case 3: C _ R E D? Like ""CURED"", ""CRIED"", ""CROME"" not? ""CRUEL""? But L is out? So L not allowed? ""CRUEL"" has L? Avoid.

Words for Case 3: C _ R E _ 
Valid English words without L, K, A, N: ""CREDO""? ""CREDO"" is C R E D O -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:E, 4:D, 5:O? But wait, R at position2? We know R cannot be in position2! From guess1? Guess1: R in pos2 was marked wrong? So secret R not position2? Therefore in ""CREDO"", R is at position2? Not allowed? So words for Case 3 must have R at position3? As in C ? R E ?

So: position 2 must be one letter, R at position3, E at position4? Then position5? 

Possible: ""C U R E D"" -> ""CURED"" (as I thought earlier)
Or ""C I R E D""? ""CIRED"" not a word?
Or ""C A R E D""? A excluded? Cannot use A.
Or ""C O R E D"" -> ""CORED""
Or ""C T R E D""? Not common.
Or ""C H R E W""? ""CHREW"" not word.
Best: ""CORED"" or ""CURED""? Both valid?

Similarly for Case 4: C ? ? E R -> ""COPER"", ""COVER"", ""COWER"", ""CAVER"" A? Excluded? Or ""CITER""?

Back to our guess: we need to make a third guess that tests some of these.

A good approach: we can guess ""CORED"": ""CORED"" means C O R E D? But positions: 
1:C (fixed), 2:O, 3:R, 4:E, 5:D

Check constraints:
For E: if the secret has E in position4, then we get it? And for R in position3? Similarly? Also, we can get new information? 

But wait, we know E cannot be in position3? From guess2? Guess2 ""clerk"" had E at position3, marked -, so E not position3? Similarly, E not position5? So E must be pos2 or pos4? In ""CORED"", E is at position4.

And R: we know not position2? And not position4? So R in position3? That fits? Because in ""CORED"", R is at position3? 

So if secret has R at position3? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if R is not at position3, then we get '-'. But note, R must be in position3 or position5? So if R not at3, it must be at5? 

Similarly, for E: if E at position4? Then ✓? Else, if E at position2, then we get '-'? 

But secret word: if it has E at position4 and R at position3? Then ""CORED"" is a candidate? 

Similarly, ""CURED"" is another? Both have R at position3.

But what if R is at position5? For example, secret word ""C O V E R"" -> ""COVER"", then R is at position5? 

When we guess ""CORED"": 
If secret is ""COVER"", then we get:
Position1: C ✓
Position2: O? Secret position2: V? Not O? But O might be absent? So:
- Position1: C ✓ 
- Position2: O: ? secret has O? ""COVER"" does not have O? So O would be marked x? 
- Position3: R: secret has R at position5? So R is in word? But position3: secret has V? Not R? So R: -
- Position4: E: secret position4: E? So ✓ 
- Position5: D? Secret position5: R? Not D? So D: x

And if secret is ""CURED"": 
- Position1: C ✓ 
- Position2: O? Secret position2: U? Not O? So O: ?
- Position3: R: secret position3: R? So ✓ 
- Position4: E: secret position4: E? ✓ 
- Position5: D: secret position5: D? ✓ 

Only if both R and E positions match? 

But if secret is ""COVER"" (with R at5), then R at3 in ""CORED"" would get '-'.

We have also other possibilities.

To get more letters, we can guess ""CORED"".

Another candidate: ""COWER"" or ""COVER""? But ""COVER"" does not have R at position3? 

Perhaps we can also guess ""CUTER"": C U T E R? But E at position4? R at position5? So positions: 
1:C, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R

And we haven't used U, T? 

In guess2 we had ""clerk"", E was at3? Not E at4.

Potential: 
If secret E at position4? Then we get ✓? 
If secret R at position5? Then we get ✓?

But what if secret E at position2? Then E at position4 in guess would get '-', etc.

Also, T and U are new letters.

But ""CUTER"" might not be common? But accepted as a word.

Let's choose: ""CURED"" is a possible word? We can guess it? But it might be the answer? So if we guess and it's wrong, we get feed? 

Better to guess a word with new letters? 

""SCARE""? Starts with S? Cannot? Position1 must be C? Fixed? No? Start must be C? Because we have C at1 fixed? So all guesses must start with C? Because position1 is C? Yes.

So every guess must start with C? Because it will be ✓ if correct? And we know it is? 

Therefore, guess starts with C? Must: C _ _ _ _

Now, with the constraints, let me design a guess.

Consider placing E at position4? To see if E is at that position? Similarly, place R at position? We can't place R at position5 because we haven't tested? Or place R at position3? Which is one option.

If we place R at position5? Then we get: if secret R at position5, ✓, else - if R at position3? But R at position3 or5? If not at5, must be at3? So we can get info? 

Similarly, place E at position2? So guess: C E ? ? R? But what letters? With avoid L,K,A,N? And the ? can be any letters.

But to have a valid word? Like ""C E D A R"" has A? Excluded? ""C E I L R""? L excluded? ""C E M E R""? Could be ""CEMER""? Not common? ""CEORL""? Not.

Perhaps ""C E T Y R""? Not word? Not easy? 

So maybe placing E at position4 is feasible? 

Guess: ""COVER"" -> C O V E R? 
Positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R

Now, this:
- Tests E at position4? If E is at pos4, we get ✓? Else if E is at pos2, then E at4 will be -
- Tests R at position5? If R at5, ✓? Else if R at3, then R at5 will be -? Because R is still in the word.

Also, introduces O, V as new letters? If any of them are in the word? We can get feedback.

So I think ""COVER"" is a good guess? 

Another possibility: ""CUTER""? C U T E R? Same structure? E at4? R at5? 

""COVER"" is more common? 

Also, ""COMER"" is less common? 

But we must check if it fits: in ""COVER"", E at position4 and R at position5? Which are possible? 

If the secret word has E at position4 and R at position5? Then we get all? ✓? 

If not, we get partial.

Also, the word might be? 

Since we have used O and V? Or not? 

So for guess3, I choose ""COVER"".

Let's see what happens if secret has E at position2? For example, secret word ""CE R something?""? But we cannot find words? 

But if secret is ""C E R T S""? But not a word? Or ""C E R G E""? Not 5 letters? So E at position2? R at position3? Then position4 and 5 need letters? E.g., ""CERNE""? Not? ""CERED""? Not? ""CEBID""? Not common? 

Similarly, E at position2 and R at position5: ""CELER""? L excluded? ""CEDER""? Not A? ""CETYL""? Not common? I think E at position2 might be less common? Plus, we haven't tested position2 with E? So by placing E in position4, we can test position4? 

Similarly, R in position5.

So ""COVER"" is suitable.

Therefore, our third guess will be ""COVER"".

<guess>cover</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** C(✓), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - This indicates that ""C"" is correct and in position 1.
  - ""R"" and ""E"" are in the word but not in positions 2 and 5, respectively.
  - ""A"" and ""N"" are not in the word and can be excluded.

- **Guess 2 (""clerk""):** C(✓), L(x), E(-), R(-), K(x)
  - This confirms ""C"" is fixed at position 1.
  - ""E"" is in the word but not in position 3 (since E at position 3 was marked wrong).
  - ""R"" is in the word but not in position 4 (since R at position 4 was marked wrong).
  - ""L"" and ""K"" are not in the word and can be excluded.

Key deductions:
- Position 1: Must be ""C"".
- Possible positions for ""E"": Positions 2 or 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).
- Possible positions for ""R"": Positions 3 or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).
- Eliminated letters: A, N, L, K. Any new guess must avoid these.
- The word must include ""R"" and ""E"", and two unknown letters from the remaining English alphabet (excluding A, N, L, K).

For the third guess, choose a word that:
- Starts with ""C"".
- Places ""E"" in position 4 (to test for E at position 4) and ""R"" in position 5 (to test for R at position 5).
- Introduces new common letters to gather more information.
- Avoids eliminated letters (A, N, L, K).

""COVER"" fits these requirements:
- C (position 1): Known correct.
- O (position 2): New letter (untested vowel).
- V (position 3): New letter (common consonant).
- E (position 4): Tests if E is in position 4.
- R (position 5): Tests if R is in position 5.

This guess will provide feedback to narrow down the positions of E and R and reveal if O or V are in the word.",Guess 3: cover -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,cider,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓
- R: -
- A: x
- N: x
- E: -

Interpretation:
- C is correct and in the right position (position 1). So the secret word starts with C.
- R is in the word but not in position 2. So R is somewhere else in the word.
- A is not in the word at all.
- N is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed in the last position).

Therefore, the secret word:
- Starts with C.
- Contains R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively (and also not A or N).
- R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

We have 5 positions: 1: C (fixed), 2: ? (not R, not A, not N), 3: ?, 4: ?, 5: ? (not E).

Letters known to be in the word: C, R, E (C is fixed at position 1).

Letters not in the word: A, N.

Since E is in the word but not at position 5, it must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4. But note that position 2 cannot be E because the feedback for R was that it's in the word but not in position 2, but it doesn't restrict E. However, we don't know if E can be in position 2 yet.

Similarly, R must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is not R).

We need to make a second guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word starting with C (since position 1 must be C).
- Does not contain A or N (since they are not in the word).
- Must include R and E (because we know they are in the word), but we don't know their positions yet.

We also want to test possible positions for R and E, and perhaps get information about the other letters.

Possible structure for the second guess:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: Some letter that is not A, N (and not R because R can't be there), but we don't know what is allowed. We can choose a common consonant.
- We need to include R and E in positions 3,4, or 5 (but not necessarily both; we already know they are in the word, so we must include them to check positions).

Alternatively, we can try to place R and E in different positions to test.

But note: We cannot reuse A or N, so our word must consist of letters excluding A and N.

List of possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we know the word has R and E).

We must include R and E in the word, but avoid A and N.

Additionally, we want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Let me think of words that start with C, contain R and E, and no A or N.

Some options:
- ""CREPT"": C, R, E, P, T -> but E in position 3? We don't know.
- ""CRWTH"" - not a common word.
- ""CREST"": C, R, E, S, T -> this is common. Let's check: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:E, 4:S, 5:T.

But note: Feedback for first guess said R is not in position 2. So if we guess ""CREST"", R is in position 2. But wait, in the secret word, R is not in position 2. So if we guess ""CREST"", we expect that R in position 2 would be marked as wrong (either '-' or 'x')? Actually, since we know R is in the word but not position 2, if we put R in position 2 we'll get a '-' for R (meaning it's in the word but wrong position), but we already know that.

Alternatively, we can avoid putting R in position 2 since we know it's incorrect, so that we can test other positions.

But let's see: if we guess ""CREST"", we place R in position 2 (which we know is wrong) and E in position 3.

If the secret word has E in position 3, then we get a ✓ for E at position 3. Otherwise, we might get a '-' if E is in the word but not position 3, or 'x' but we know E is in the word so it can't be 'x'.

Actually, we know E is in the word, so if E is not in position 3, we get '-'.

Similarly, for R: we know R is in the word, and if we put it in position 2, we'll get '-' because we know it's not position 2.

But we can also try to place R in a different position.

Another idea: place R in position 3 or 4 or 5 to see if it gets ✓.

For example, let's try to make a word with C at 1, E at 2 (but is E allowed at position 2? We don't know yet), and R at 3,4 or 5.

We need to consider: the feedback told us E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 2,3, or 4.

Similarly, R can be at position 3,4, or 5.

So, let's choose a word that places E in a new position, say position 2, and R in position 3,4, or 5.

But note: the secret word has 5 letters and we know C (position1), R, E, and two more letters.

We don't know the other two letters.

Word: ""CEDAR"" - but we cannot use A (since A is not in the word), so avoid A.

Word: ""CHERT"" - C, H, E, R, T -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:R, 5:T.

That might be a good one: it avoids position 2 for R (we put R at 4) and E at position 3. Also, we test H and T.

Another option: ""CREPT"" - C, R, E, P, T -> but R is at position 2? We know R is not at position 2, so putting R at position 2 would be a waste because we know it's wrong.

So, let's avoid putting R in position 2.

Similarly, in ""CREST"", R is at position 2, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid that.

Better to try a word that has R in a different position.

Options:
- ""CERES"" - not a common word.
- ""CODER"" - C, O, D, E, R -> but E is at position 4 and R at position 5. Also, O, D are new.

But note: position 1 is C, position 2 is O, position 3 is D, position 4 is E, position 5 is R.

This places E at position 4 and R at position 5.

We know E is not at position 5, but can be at 4. Similarly, R not at 2, but can be at 5.

Also, we don't use A or N.

So, ""CODER"" is a valid word? Yes, in programming, but also in English as a noun (one who codes). However, it might be accepted.

But perhaps we can choose a more common word.

Another word: ""CUTER"" - C, U, T, E, R -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R.

This also avoids position 2 for R and position 5 for E (E is at position 4, R at position 5).

But we don't know if E can be at position 4 or R at position 5.

I think ""CUTER"" is acceptable.

But we also want to cover other common letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""CRUEL"": C, R, U, E, L -> but R is at position 2? No, if we structure it as 1:C, 2:R? Bad, because we know R is not at position 2.

We need to avoid position 2 for R.

How about ""CLERK"": C, L, E, R, K -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:R, 5:K.

This places E at position 3 and R at position 4.

And L and K are new.

This seems good because:
- Position 1: C (we know correct)
- Position 2: L (new)
- Position 3: E (if E is at position 3, we get ✓, if not we get '-' or ... but since E is in the word, it will be '-' if not at position 3)
- Position 4: R (if R is at position 4, we get ✓, else if R is elsewhere, we get '-')
- Position 5: K (new)

Also, no A, N.

Moreover, ""CLERK"" is a common word.

So, I think ""CLERK"" is a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""CRIMP"" - but R is at position 2? Avoid.

""CREME"" - but E repeated? And R at position 2? Avoid.

""COVER"" - C, O, V, E, R -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R -> same as before.

But ""CLERK"" is fine.

I'll go with ""CLERK"".

So, second guess: ""CLERK""

But note: we have to return it in the specified format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in the right position (✓ at position 1), so the secret word starts with ""C"".
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is not in the word (x), so it can be excluded.
- N is not in the word (x), so it can be excluded.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
- The word starts with ""C"".
- The word contains ""R"" and ""E"", which must be placed in positions other than the ones guessed: R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
- A and N are not in the word, so the second guess must avoid these letters.

Since R and E could be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (with position 5 excluded for E), a strong second guess should:
- Start with ""C"".
- Include both ""R"" and ""E"" to test their possible positions.
- Avoid A and N.
- Use common letters to maximize information.

""CLERK"" is a good candidate:
- Position 1: C (fixed and correct).
- Position 2: L (new letter to test).
- Position 3: E (tests if E is in position 3).
- Position 4: R (tests if R is in position 4).
- Position 5: K (new letter to test).

This avoids known incorrect positions for R and E while covering new consonants like L and K.

<guess>clerk</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: clerk -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) E(-) R(-) K(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Second guess: ""clerK"" (capital K for emphasis, but it's a letter)
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- L: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- K: x (not in word)

From this, we know:

1. The word starts with C (position 1 is fixed).
2. The letters R and E are in the word, but neither was in their guessed positions:
   - In ""crane"", R was guessed in position 2 and E in position 5; both were marked wrong position.
   - In ""clerk"", E was guessed in position 3 and R in position 4; both were marked wrong position.

So we can deduce:
- R is not in positions 2, 3, or 4? Wait, no: we only know it's not in pos 2 (from guess1) and not in pos 4 (from guess2), and it might be in pos 3 or 5? But guess2 had R in pos 4, so it's not pos 4. And guess1 had R in pos 2, not pos 2. But we haven't tested pos 5 for R? So R could be in position 3 or 5? However, we don't have information about position 3 for R because in guess2 we tested E in position 3, not R.

Similarly for E:
- E is not in pos 5 (guess1) and not in pos 3 (guess2) because guess2 had E in pos3 and it was marked as '-', meaning it's not pos3. So E cannot be in positions 3 or 5? And we haven't tested position 2 for E? So possible positions for E are 2 or 4? And for R: we know not pos2 (guess1) and not pos4 (guess2), so R must be in pos3 (since pos1 is C) or pos5? But note: the secret word has exactly 5 positions.

Potential positions for R: 3 or 5? (because 2 and 4 are excluded)
But: position 1 is C, so R cannot be there.

Also, we know E is in the word but not pos3 or pos5? So E must be in pos2 or pos4.

Now, letters we have excluded from the word:
- A (from guess1)
- N (from guess1)
- L (from guess2)
- K (from guess2)

So the word contains:
- C (fixed at pos1)
- R
- E
- plus two other letters that are not A, N, L, or K.

Now, we have two unknowns: the two letters and the positions of R and E.

But note: we cannot have R and E in positions that are already excluded.

Possible configurations:

Let the word be: C _ _ _ _

Position 2: Either E or one of the other letters. But E can be pos2? We haven't tested pos2 for E? Actually, we have not guessed E in pos2 yet.

Similarly, position 3: we have not tested for R? But we tested for E in pos3 and it was wrong. But R could be in pos3? Yes.

Position 4: we tested R in pos4 and it was wrong, so R not at pos4.

Position 5: we tested E in pos5 and it was wrong? So E cannot be pos5.

Therefore:
- R must be in position 3 or 5? Because pos2 and pos4 are invalid for R.
- E must be in position 2 or 4? Because pos3 and pos5 are invalid for E.

But note: if R is in pos3, E could be pos2 or pos4. Similarly, if R is in pos5, E could be pos2 or pos4.

However, the position constraints must be considered with the rest of the word.

We also need to choose a third guess that uses the known information and gives us more clues.

We must avoid letters L, K, A, N.

We must include R and E? No, we already know they are in the word, so our guess must include them? Not necessarily, but we have only 6 guesses and we need to solve, so guessing a word without R or E would be bad because we won't get information about the positions? Or we might not include them to test other letters? But since we have limited guesses, it's better to include the known letters to confirm their positions? However, we know R and E are in the word, so we can try to place them in the possible positions that remain.

Possible positions for E: 2 or 4.
Possible positions for R: 3 or 5.

So that gives us four cases:

Case 1: E at 2, R at 3 -> word: C E R ? ?
Case 2: E at 2, R at 5 -> word: C E ? ? R
Case 3: E at 4, R at 3 -> word: C ? R E ?
Case 4: E at 4, R at 5 -> word: C ? ? E R

But each of these has two more letters to be determined? We have positions to fill.

For each case, we need a guess that fits one of these patterns? Or we can make a guess that tests one of these possibilities.

However, our guess must be a valid English word.

We also have to use letters that have not been eliminated: so letters excluding A, N, L, K.

But note: we haven't used many letters? We have used C, R, A, N, E, L, K? And the word must have two more letters? Unknown.

In guess1: ""crane"" letters: C,R,A,N,E
In guess2: ""clerk"": C,L,E,R,K

So covered letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, K

Eliminated letters: A, N, L, K

So remaining letters: all English vowels and consonants except A,N,L,K.

We should focus on common remaining letters: maybe vowels O, U? Or consonants B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But no A or N or L or K? So L and K are out? But in first guess E was present? And R.

Actually E and R are in, and C is fixed.

So for the word we need: starting with C, contains E and R (and E and R positions constrained), and two other letters from the remaining set of letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But specifically: avoid A, N, L, K.

Now, we can design a guess that fits one of the cases? Or tests multiple possibilities.

But note: if we guess a word with E in position 2, we can see if E is indeed in pos2? Similarly for R.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that places E in one of its possible positions and R in one of its, and also uses new letters to test.

But we have only one more guess to get information?

We need to cover more letters? Or constrain possibilities.

What are common words to guess?

First, let's list possible positions:

If we assume case 1: word like C E R _ _
What can fit? E.g., ""CERTS"" or ""CERTY""? Not valid? ""CERES"" not common? ""CERV""? Not 5.

But ""CERTY"" is not a word? ""CERTS"" no? ""CERT"" is 4; need 5 letters.

Actually, valid English words: ""CERTy"" -> ""CERTY"" is not standard? But ""CERTY"" no? Let me think: ""CERTS"" is not a common word? Better: ""CERED""? Not valid.

Instead, let's consider case 3 or case 4? What words exist?

Case 3: word C _ R E _
Possible: ""CURED"" (C _ R E _) -> positions:2:U, 5:D? But D is allowed? No A,N,L,K.
But ""CURED"" would be: position1:C, position2:U, position3:R, position4:E, position5:D.
In this case: U, R, E, D? But R is at position3? We have? U and E,D? But E at position4.

Now check against known: 
If secret word were ""CURED"":
- For guess1 ""crane"": position1: C? Yes and ✓? No: ""crane"" has C at1: ✓. R at2: secret has R at3? So R at2 not same? So R: in word, wrong position? That matches -. A at3: secret has U? So not A? A x matches? N at4: secret has E? So not N x? E at5: secret has D? So E? Secret has E at4? So E at5 is not correct? And E is in word? So E: -? Matches.

Guess2: ""clerk"": C ✓ L: secret has U? Not L? L x? E: at position3? Secret has E at4? So E in word wrong position? Hence -? R at position4? Secret has R at3? So R at4 is wrong? Hence -? K at5: secret has D? So K x? Matches the feedback? So ""CURED"" is entirely possible? 

But note: in guess2 we guessed ""clerk"" and got E at position3: -, but secret has E at position4? So indeed, E was guessed in pos3 (wrong) and R in pos4 (wrong)? And R is at pos3? So in guess2, we didn't have R at position3? We had R at position4? So position3 was E? And result was E: -? Because E is not at pos3? Correct.

Similarly, case 1: C E R _ _ 
What word? ""CERTs""? No? ""CERVS""? No? ""CERSE""? Not common? ""CERES"" is a name? Not common? ""CERTY"" not a word?

Another possibility: ""CERO""? Not 5 letters.

Case 2: C E _ _ R
Examples: ""CENTER""? Not because it has T,E,N? N is excluded? But N is not in? We have to avoid N? So ""CETER""? No? ""CEDER""? E? But E at position2, R at position5? ""CEDER"": C E D E R? But E at position2 and position4? Secret word could have two E's? But the feedback doesn't tell us duplicates? We don't know? Actually, we aren't told about duplicate letters? In feedback, if a letter appears in the secret multiple times? But let me check: in guess2 ""clerk"": we used E once? And got E:-, meaning E is not in position3? But if secret had two E's, then if E in position3 absent? But E might appear elsewhere? But generally, no indication? So possibility.

But ""CEDER"" is not common? ""CEDAR"" excluded because A? A is out? So no.

""CEILR""? Not English? Better: ""CELLR""? No? Not good.

Case 4: C _ _ E R
Examples: ""CATER"" -> C A T E R? But A is excluded? Cannot use A? ""COMER""? C O M E R? That could be? Avoid A,N,L,K? Yes? Also ""COVER"", ""COWER"", etc.

But we have case 3: C _ R E _ -> like ""CURED"", ""CRIED"", etc.

And our guess2 eliminated L and K? So we can form words with other letters.

But to get information faster, we should guess a word that will test the positions for E and R and also use new common letters? Also, we want to use letters that haven't been used? To see if they appear.

For example, we can guess a word that places E at position 2 and R at position 5? Or position3? Etc? But because of constraints?

Best: try to guess a word that fits Case 3 or Case 4? But we don't know which? So choose a guess that will distinguish? Or cover.

Proposal: guess a word that has E at position 2 (to test if E is at position 2) and R at one of its possible positions? Also? And new letters.

For example, let's try ""CATER"": but A excluded? Not possible? Avoid A.

So ""COMER""? But it might not be common? ""CODER""? D, O? But in guess2 we didn't have O or D? So ""CODER"": C O D E R -> E at position4? Not position2? Wait, position2 is O? Position4 is E.

If E is in position2? Then we need a word like ""C E _ _ _"".

For example, ""CEBID""? Not common? ""CEDAR"" excluded? ""CEILI""? No? ""CELLO"": C E L L O? But we know L is not in the word! Because in guess2, L was at position2? Eliminated with x? So if L is eliminated, we cannot use L? So ""CELLO"" is invalid? Cannot have L. Similarly, K is eliminated.

So we must avoid L.

Possible word with E in position2: ""CEASE""? But A and E? A is out? ""CEASE"" has A? No? If we avoid A? ""CEILI""? No? ""CENSE""? But N is out? ""CEORL""? Not English? This is hard.

Alternative: ""CEMENT"": too long? No, 5 letters? ""CEMENT"" is 6? Not. How about ""CERES""? Not common.

Perhaps it's easier to test the other position? Place E at position4 and R at position5? Since R cannot be position3? Or test E at position4.

Similarly, we can choose a word that fits Case 4: C _ _ E R? Like ""COWER"", ""COVER"", ""COMER"".

Or Case 3: C _ R E D? Like ""CURED"", ""CRIED"", ""CROME"" not? ""CRUEL""? But L is out? So L not allowed? ""CRUEL"" has L? Avoid.

Words for Case 3: C _ R E _ 
Valid English words without L, K, A, N: ""CREDO""? ""CREDO"" is C R E D O -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:E, 4:D, 5:O? But wait, R at position2? We know R cannot be in position2! From guess1? Guess1: R in pos2 was marked wrong? So secret R not position2? Therefore in ""CREDO"", R is at position2? Not allowed? So words for Case 3 must have R at position3? As in C ? R E ?

So: position 2 must be one letter, R at position3, E at position4? Then position5? 

Possible: ""C U R E D"" -> ""CURED"" (as I thought earlier)
Or ""C I R E D""? ""CIRED"" not a word?
Or ""C A R E D""? A excluded? Cannot use A.
Or ""C O R E D"" -> ""CORED""
Or ""C T R E D""? Not common.
Or ""C H R E W""? ""CHREW"" not word.
Best: ""CORED"" or ""CURED""? Both valid?

Similarly for Case 4: C ? ? E R -> ""COPER"", ""COVER"", ""COWER"", ""CAVER"" A? Excluded? Or ""CITER""?

Back to our guess: we need to make a third guess that tests some of these.

A good approach: we can guess ""CORED"": ""CORED"" means C O R E D? But positions: 
1:C (fixed), 2:O, 3:R, 4:E, 5:D

Check constraints:
For E: if the secret has E in position4, then we get it? And for R in position3? Similarly? Also, we can get new information? 

But wait, we know E cannot be in position3? From guess2? Guess2 ""clerk"" had E at position3, marked -, so E not position3? Similarly, E not position5? So E must be pos2 or pos4? In ""CORED"", E is at position4.

And R: we know not position2? And not position4? So R in position3? That fits? Because in ""CORED"", R is at position3? 

So if secret has R at position3? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if R is not at position3, then we get '-'. But note, R must be in position3 or position5? So if R not at3, it must be at5? 

Similarly, for E: if E at position4? Then ✓? Else, if E at position2, then we get '-'? 

But secret word: if it has E at position4 and R at position3? Then ""CORED"" is a candidate? 

Similarly, ""CURED"" is another? Both have R at position3.

But what if R is at position5? For example, secret word ""C O V E R"" -> ""COVER"", then R is at position5? 

When we guess ""CORED"": 
If secret is ""COVER"", then we get:
Position1: C ✓
Position2: O? Secret position2: V? Not O? But O might be absent? So:
- Position1: C ✓ 
- Position2: O: ? secret has O? ""COVER"" does not have O? So O would be marked x? 
- Position3: R: secret has R at position5? So R is in word? But position3: secret has V? Not R? So R: -
- Position4: E: secret position4: E? So ✓ 
- Position5: D? Secret position5: R? Not D? So D: x

And if secret is ""CURED"": 
- Position1: C ✓ 
- Position2: O? Secret position2: U? Not O? So O: ?
- Position3: R: secret position3: R? So ✓ 
- Position4: E: secret position4: E? ✓ 
- Position5: D: secret position5: D? ✓ 

Only if both R and E positions match? 

But if secret is ""COVER"" (with R at5), then R at3 in ""CORED"" would get '-'.

We have also other possibilities.

To get more letters, we can guess ""CORED"".

Another candidate: ""COWER"" or ""COVER""? But ""COVER"" does not have R at position3? 

Perhaps we can also guess ""CUTER"": C U T E R? But E at position4? R at position5? So positions: 
1:C, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R

And we haven't used U, T? 

In guess2 we had ""clerk"", E was at3? Not E at4.

Potential: 
If secret E at position4? Then we get ✓? 
If secret R at position5? Then we get ✓?

But what if secret E at position2? Then E at position4 in guess would get '-', etc.

Also, T and U are new letters.

But ""CUTER"" might not be common? But accepted as a word.

Let's choose: ""CURED"" is a possible word? We can guess it? But it might be the answer? So if we guess and it's wrong, we get feed? 

Better to guess a word with new letters? 

""SCARE""? Starts with S? Cannot? Position1 must be C? Fixed? No? Start must be C? Because we have C at1 fixed? So all guesses must start with C? Because position1 is C? Yes.

So every guess must start with C? Because it will be ✓ if correct? And we know it is? 

Therefore, guess starts with C? Must: C _ _ _ _

Now, with the constraints, let me design a guess.

Consider placing E at position4? To see if E is at that position? Similarly, place R at position? We can't place R at position5 because we haven't tested? Or place R at position3? Which is one option.

If we place R at position5? Then we get: if secret R at position5, ✓, else - if R at position3? But R at position3 or5? If not at5, must be at3? So we can get info? 

Similarly, place E at position2? So guess: C E ? ? R? But what letters? With avoid L,K,A,N? And the ? can be any letters.

But to have a valid word? Like ""C E D A R"" has A? Excluded? ""C E I L R""? L excluded? ""C E M E R""? Could be ""CEMER""? Not common? ""CEORL""? Not.

Perhaps ""C E T Y R""? Not word? Not easy? 

So maybe placing E at position4 is feasible? 

Guess: ""COVER"" -> C O V E R? 
Positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R

Now, this:
- Tests E at position4? If E is at pos4, we get ✓? Else if E is at pos2, then E at4 will be -
- Tests R at position5? If R at5, ✓? Else if R at3, then R at5 will be -? Because R is still in the word.

Also, introduces O, V as new letters? If any of them are in the word? We can get feedback.

So I think ""COVER"" is a good guess? 

Another possibility: ""CUTER""? C U T E R? Same structure? E at4? R at5? 

""COVER"" is more common? 

Also, ""COMER"" is less common? 

But we must check if it fits: in ""COVER"", E at position4 and R at position5? Which are possible? 

If the secret word has E at position4 and R at position5? Then we get all? ✓? 

If not, we get partial.

Also, the word might be? 

Since we have used O and V? Or not? 

So for guess3, I choose ""COVER"".

Let's see what happens if secret has E at position2? For example, secret word ""CE R something?""? But we cannot find words? 

But if secret is ""C E R T S""? But not a word? Or ""C E R G E""? Not 5 letters? So E at position2? R at position3? Then position4 and 5 need letters? E.g., ""CERNE""? Not? ""CERED""? Not? ""CEBID""? Not common? 

Similarly, E at position2 and R at position5: ""CELER""? L excluded? ""CEDER""? Not A? ""CETYL""? Not common? I think E at position2 might be less common? Plus, we haven't tested position2 with E? So by placing E in position4, we can test position4? 

Similarly, R in position5.

So ""COVER"" is suitable.

Therefore, our third guess will be ""COVER"".

<guess>cover</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** C(✓), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - This indicates that ""C"" is correct and in position 1.
  - ""R"" and ""E"" are in the word but not in positions 2 and 5, respectively.
  - ""A"" and ""N"" are not in the word and can be excluded.

- **Guess 2 (""clerk""):** C(✓), L(x), E(-), R(-), K(x)
  - This confirms ""C"" is fixed at position 1.
  - ""E"" is in the word but not in position 3 (since E at position 3 was marked wrong).
  - ""R"" is in the word but not in position 4 (since R at position 4 was marked wrong).
  - ""L"" and ""K"" are not in the word and can be excluded.

Key deductions:
- Position 1: Must be ""C"".
- Possible positions for ""E"": Positions 2 or 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).
- Possible positions for ""R"": Positions 3 or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).
- Eliminated letters: A, N, L, K. Any new guess must avoid these.
- The word must include ""R"" and ""E"", and two unknown letters from the remaining English alphabet (excluding A, N, L, K).

For the third guess, choose a word that:
- Starts with ""C"".
- Places ""E"" in position 4 (to test for E at position 4) and ""R"" in position 5 (to test for R at position 5).
- Introduces new common letters to gather more information.
- Avoids eliminated letters (A, N, L, K).

""COVER"" fits these requirements:
- C (position 1): Known correct.
- O (position 2): New letter (untested vowel).
- V (position 3): New letter (common consonant).
- E (position 4): Tests if E is in position 4.
- R (position 5): Tests if R is in position 5.

This guess will provide feedback to narrow down the positions of E and R and reveal if O or V are in the word.

However, we don\'t know if E can be in position 2 yet.\n\nSimilarly, R must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is not R).\n\nWe need to make a second guess that:\n- Is a 5-letter word starting with C (since position 1 must be C).\n- Does not contain A or N (since they are not in the word).\n- Must include R and E (because we know they are in the word), but we don\'t know their positions yet.\n\nWe also want to test possible positions for R and E, and perhaps get information about the other letters.\n\nPossible structure for the second guess:\n- Position 1: C (fixed)\n- Position 2: Some letter that is not A, N (and not R because R can\'t be there), but we don\'t know what is allowed.

We don\'t know.\n- ""CRWTH"" - not a common word.\n- ""CREST"": C, R, E, S, T -> this is common. Let\'s check: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:E, 4:S, 5:T.\n\nBut note: Feedback for first guess said R is not in position 2. So if we guess ""CREST"", R is in position 2. But wait, in the secret word, R is not in position 2. So if we guess ""CREST"", we expect that R in position 2 would be marked as wrong (either \'-\' or \'x\')? Actually, since we know R is in the word but not position 2, if we put R in position 2 we\'ll get a \'-\' for R (meaning it\'s in the word but wrong position), but we already know that.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid putting R in position 2 since we know it\'s incorrect, so that we can test other positions.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess ""CREST"", we place R in position 2 (which we know is wrong) and E in position 3.\n\nIf the secret word has E in position 3, then we get a ✓ for E at position 3. Otherwise, we might get a \'-\' if E is in the word but not position 3, or \'x\' but we know E is in the word so it can\'t be \'x\'.\n\nActually, we know E is in the word, so if E is not in position 3, we get \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly, for R: we know R is in the word, and if we put it in position 2, we\'ll get \'-\' because we know it\'s not position 2.\n\nBut we can also try to place R in a different position.\n\nAnother idea: place R in position 3 or 4 or 5 to see if it gets ✓.\n\nFor example, let\'s try to make a word with C at 1, E at 2 (but is E allowed at position 2? We don\'t know yet), and R at 3,4 or 5.\n\nWe need to consider: the feedback told us E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 2,3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, R can be at position 3,4, or 5.\n\nSo, let\'s choose a word that places E in a new position, say position 2, and R in position 3,4, or 5.\n\nBut note: the secret word has 5 letters and we know C (position1), R, E, and two more letters.\n\nWe don\'t know the other two letters.\n\nWord: ""CEDAR"" - but we cannot use A (since A is not in the word), so avoid A.\n\nWord: ""CHERT"" - C, H, E, R, T -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:R, 5:T.\n\nThat might be a good one: it avoids position 2 for R (we put R at 4) and E at position 3. Also, we test H and T.\n\nAnother option: ""CREPT"" - C, R, E, P, T -> but R is at position 2? We know R is not at position 2, so putting R at position 2 would be a waste because we know it\'s wrong.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid putting R in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, in ""CREST"", R is at position 2, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid that.\n\nBetter to try a word that has R in a different position.\n\nOptions:\n- ""CERES"" - not a common word.\n- ""CODER"" - C, O, D, E, R -> but E is at position 4 and R at position 5. Also, O, D are new.\n\nBut note: position 1 is C, position 2 is O, position 3 is D, position 4 is E, position 5 is R.\n\nThis places E at position 4 and R at position 5.\n\nWe know E is not at position 5, but can be at 4. Similarly, R not at 2, but can be at 5.\n\nAlso, we don\'t use A or N.\n\nSo, ""CODER"" is a valid word? Yes, in programming, but also in English as a noun (one who codes). However, it might be accepted.\n\nBut perhaps we can choose a more common word.\n\nAnother word: ""CUTER"" - C, U, T, E, R -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R.\n\nThis also avoids position 2 for R and position 5 for E (E is at position 4, R at position 5).\n\nBut we don\'t know if E can be at position 4 or R at position 5.\n\nI think ""CUTER"" is acceptable.\n\nBut we also want to cover other common letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""CRUEL"": C, R, U, E, L -> but R is at position 2? No, if we structure it as 1:C, 2:R? Bad, because we know R is not at position 2.\n\nWe need to avoid position 2 for R.\n\nHow about ""CLERK"": C, L, E, R, K -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:R, 5:K.\n\nThis places E at position 3 and R at position 4.\n\nAnd L and K are new.\n\nThis seems good because:\n- Position 1: C (we know correct)\n- Position 2: L (new)\n- Position 3: E (if E is at position 3, we get ✓, if not we get \'-\' or ... but since E is in the word, it will be \'-\' if not at position 3)\n- Position 4: R (if R is at position 4, we get ✓, else if R is elsewhere, we get \'-\')\n- Position 5: K (new)\n\nAlso, no A, N.\n\nMoreover, ""CLERK"" is a common word.\n\nSo, I think ""CLERK"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother possibility: ""CRIMP"" - but R is at position 2? Avoid.\n\n""CREME"" - but E repeated? And R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n""COVER"" - C, O, V, E, R -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R -> same as before.\n\nBut ""CLERK"" is fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""CLERK"".\n\nSo, second guess: ""CLERK""\n\nBut note: we have to return it in the specified format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is correct and in the right position (✓ at position 1), so the secret word starts with ""C"".\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).\n- A is not in the word (x), so it can be excluded.\n- N is not in the word (x), so it can be excluded.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).\n\nKey deductions:\n- The word starts with ""C"".\n- The word contains ""R"" and ""E"", which must be placed in positions other than the ones guessed: R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.\n- A and N are not in the word, so the second guess must avoid these letters.\n\nSince R and E could be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (with position 5 excluded for E), a strong second guess should:\n- Start with ""C"".\n- Include both ""R"" and ""E"" to test their possible positions.\n- Avoid A and N.\n- Use common letters to maximize information.\n\n""CLERK"" is a good candidate:\n- Position 1: C (fixed and correct).\n- Position 2: L (new letter to test).\n- Position 3: E (tests if E is in position 3).\n- Position 4: R (tests if R is in position 4).\n- Position 5: K (new letter to test).\n\nThis avoids known incorrect positions for R and E while covering new consonants like L and K.\n\n<guess>clerk</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: clerk -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) E(-) R(-) K(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n- C: ✓ (correct position)\n- R: - (in word, wrong position)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position)\n\nSecond guess: ""clerK"" (capital K for emphasis, but it\'s a letter)\n- C: ✓ (correct position)\n- L: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position)\n- R: - (in word, wrong position)\n- K: x (not in word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n\n1. The word starts with C (position 1 is fixed).\n2. The letters R and E are in the word, but neither was in their guessed positions:\n   - In ""crane"", R was guessed in position 2 and E in position 5; both were marked wrong position.\n   - In ""clerk"", E was guessed in position 3 and R in position 4; both were marked wrong position.\n\nSo we can deduce:\n- R is not in positions 2, 3, or 4? Wait, no: we only know it\'s not in pos 2 (from guess1) and not in pos 4 (from guess2), and it might be in pos 3 or 5? But guess2 had R in pos 4, so it\'s not pos 4. And guess1 had R in pos 2, not pos 2. But we haven\'t tested pos 5 for R? So R could be in position 3 or 5? However, we don\'t have information about position 3 for R because in guess2 we tested E in position 3, not R.\n\nSimilarly for E:\n- E is not in pos 5 (guess1) and not in pos 3 (guess2) because guess2 had E in pos3 and it was marked as \'-\', meaning it\'s not pos3. So E cannot be in positions 3 or 5? And we haven\'t tested position 2 for E? So possible positions for E are 2 or 4? And for R: we know not pos2 (guess1) and not pos4 (guess2), so R must be in pos3 (since pos1 is C) or pos5? But note: the secret word has exactly 5 positions.\n\nPotential positions for R: 3 or 5? (because 2 and 4 are excluded)\nBut: position 1 is C, so R cannot be there.\n\nAlso, we know E is in the word but not pos3 or pos5? So E must be in pos2 or pos4.\n\nNow, letters we have excluded from the word:\n- A (from guess1)\n- N (from guess1)\n- L (from guess2)\n- K (from guess2)\n\nSo the word contains:\n- C (fixed at pos1)\n- R\n- E\n- plus two other letters that are not A, N, L, or K.\n\nNow, we have two unknowns: the two letters and the positions of R and E.\n\nBut note: we cannot have R and E in positions that are already excluded.\n\nPossible configurations:\n\nLet the word be: C _ _ _ _\n\nPosition 2: Either E or one of the other letters. But E can be pos2? We haven\'t tested pos2 for E? Actually, we have not guessed E in pos2 yet.\n\nSimilarly, position 3: we have not tested for R? But we tested for E in pos3 and it was wrong. But R could be in pos3? Yes.\n\nPosition 4: we tested R in pos4 and it was wrong, so R not at pos4.\n\nPosition 5: we tested E in pos5 and it was wrong? So E cannot be pos5.\n\nTherefore:\n- R must be in position 3 or 5? Because pos2 and pos4 are invalid for R.\n- E must be in position 2 or 4? Because pos3 and pos5 are invalid for E.\n\nBut note: if R is in pos3, E could be pos2 or pos4. Similarly, if R is in pos5, E could be pos2 or pos4.\n\nHowever, the position constraints must be considered with the rest of the word.\n\nWe also need to choose a third guess that uses the known information and gives us more clues.\n\nWe must avoid letters L, K, A, N.\n\nWe must include R and E? No, we already know they are in the word, so our guess must include them? Not necessarily, but we have only 6 guesses and we need to solve, so guessing a word without R or E would be bad because we won\'t get information about the positions? Or we might not include them to test other letters? But since we have limited guesses, it\'s better to include the known letters to confirm their positions? However, we know R and E are in the word, so we can try to place them in the possible positions that remain.\n\nPossible positions for E: 2 or 4.\nPossible positions for R: 3 or 5.\n\nSo that gives us four cases:\n\nCase 1: E at 2, R at 3 -> word: C E R ? ?\nCase 2: E at 2, R at 5 -> word: C E ? ? R\nCase 3: E at 4, R at 3 -> word: C ? R E ?\nCase 4: E at 4, R at 5 -> word: C ? ? E R\n\nBut each of these has two more letters to be determined? We have positions to fill.\n\nFor each case, we need a guess that fits one of these patterns? Or we can make a guess that tests one of these possibilities.\n\nHowever, our guess must be a valid English word.\n\nWe also have to use letters that have not been eliminated: so letters excluding A, N, L, K.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t used many letters? We have used C, R, A, N, E, L, K? And the word must have two more letters? Unknown.\n\nIn guess1: ""crane"" letters: C,R,A,N,E\nIn guess2: ""clerk"": C,L,E,R,K\n\nSo covered letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, K\n\nEliminated letters: A, N, L, K\n\nSo remaining letters: all English vowels and consonants except A,N,L,K.\n\nWe should focus on common remaining letters: maybe vowels O, U? Or consonants B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But no A or N or L or K? So L and K are out? But in first guess E was present? And R.\n\nActually E and R are in, and C is fixed.\n\nSo for the word we need: starting with C, contains E and R (and E and R positions constrained), and two other letters from the remaining set of letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut specifically: avoid A, N, L, K.\n\nNow, we can design a guess that fits one of the cases? Or tests multiple possibilities.\n\nBut note: if we guess a word with E in position 2, we can see if E is indeed in pos2? Similarly for R.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that places E in one of its possible positions and R in one of its, and also uses new letters to test.\n\nBut we have only one more guess to get information?\n\nWe need to cover more letters? Or constrain possibilities.\n\nWhat are common words to guess?\n\nFirst, let\'s list possible positions:\n\nIf we assume case 1: word like C E R _ _\nWhat can fit? E.g., ""CERTS"" or ""CERTY""? Not valid? ""CERES"" not common? ""CERV""? Not 5.\n\nBut ""CERTY"" is not a word? ""CERTS"" no? ""CERT"" is 4; need 5 letters.\n\nActually, valid English words: ""CERTy"" -> ""CERTY"" is not standard? But ""CERTY"" no? Let me think: ""CERTS"" is not a common word? Better: ""CERED""? Not valid.\n\nInstead, let\'s consider case 3 or case 4? What words exist?\n\nCase 3: word C _ R E _\nPossible: ""CURED"" (C _ R E _) -> positions:2:U, 5:D? But D is allowed? No A,N,L,K.\nBut ""CURED"" would be: position1:C, position2:U, position3:R, position4:E, position5:D.\nIn this case: U, R, E, D? But R is at position3? We have? U and E,D? But E at position4.\n\nNow check against known: \nIf secret word were ""CURED"":\n- For guess1 ""crane"": position1: C? Yes and ✓? No: ""crane"" has C at1: ✓. R at2: secret has R at3? So R at2 not same? So R: in word, wrong position? That matches -. A at3: secret has U? So not A? A x matches? N at4: secret has E? So not N x? E at5: secret has D? So E? Secret has E at4? So E at5 is not correct? And E is in word? So E: -? Matches.\n\nGuess2: ""clerk"": C ✓ L: secret has U? Not L? L x? E: at position3? Secret has E at4? So E in word wrong position? Hence -? R at position4? Secret has R at3? So R at4 is wrong? Hence -? K at5: secret has D? So K x? Matches the feedback? So ""CURED"" is entirely possible? \n\nBut note: in guess2 we guessed ""clerk"" and got E at position3: -, but secret has E at position4? So indeed, E was guessed in pos3 (wrong) and R in pos4 (wrong)? And R is at pos3? So in guess2, we didn\'t have R at position3? We had R at position4? So position3 was E? And result was E: -? Because E is not at pos3? Correct.\n\nSimilarly, case 1: C E R _ _ \nWhat word? ""CERTs""? No? ""CERVS""? No? ""CERSE""? Not common? ""CERES"" is a name? Not common? ""CERTY"" not a word?\n\nAnother possibility: ""CERO""? Not 5 letters.\n\nCase 2: C E _ _ R\nExamples: ""CENTER""? Not because it has T,E,N? N is excluded? But N is not in? We have to avoid N? So ""CETER""? No? ""CEDER""? E? But E at position2, R at position5? ""CEDER"": C E D E R? But E at position2 and position4? Secret word could have two E\'s? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us duplicates? We don\'t know? Actually, we aren\'t told about duplicate letters? In feedback, if a letter appears in the secret multiple times? But let me check: in guess2 ""clerk"": we used E once? And got E:-, meaning E is not in position3? But if secret had two E\'s, then if E in position3 absent? But E might appear elsewhere? But generally, no indication? So possibility.\n\nBut ""CEDER"" is not common? ""CEDAR"" excluded because A? A is out? So no.\n\n""CEILR""? Not English? Better: ""CELLR""? No? Not good.\n\nCase 4: C _ _ E R\nExamples: ""CATER"" -> C A T E R? But A is excluded? Cannot use A? ""COMER""? C O M E R? That could be? Avoid A,N,L,K? Yes? Also ""COVER"", ""COWER"", etc.\n\nBut we have case 3: C _ R E _ -> like ""CURED"", ""CRIED"", etc.\n\nAnd our guess2 eliminated L and K? So we can form words with other letters.\n\nBut to get information faster, we should guess a word that will test the positions for E and R and also use new common letters? Also, we want to use letters that haven\'t been used? To see if they appear.\n\nFor example, we can guess a word that places E at position 2 and R at position 5? Or position3? Etc? But because of constraints?\n\nBest: try to guess a word that fits Case 3 or Case 4? But we don\'t know which? So choose a guess that will distinguish? Or cover.\n\nProposal: guess a word that has E at position 2 (to test if E is at position 2) and R at one of its possible positions? Also? And new letters.\n\nFor example, let\'s try ""CATER"": but A excluded? Not possible? Avoid A.\n\nSo ""COMER""? But it might not be common? ""CODER""? D, O? But in guess2 we didn\'t have O or D? So ""CODER"": C O D E R -> E at position4? Not position2? Wait, position2 is O? Position4 is E.\n\nIf E is in position2? Then we need a word like ""C E _ _ _"".\n\nFor example, ""CEBID""? Not common? ""CEDAR"" excluded? ""CEILI""? No? ""CELLO"": C E L L O? But we know L is not in the word! Because in guess2, L was at position2? Eliminated with x? So if L is eliminated, we cannot use L? So ""CELLO"" is invalid? Cannot have L. Similarly, K is eliminated.\n\nSo we must avoid L.\n\nPossible word with E in position2: ""CEASE""? But A and E? A is out? ""CEASE"" has A? No? If we avoid A? ""CEILI""? No? ""CENSE""? But N is out? ""CEORL""? Not English? This is hard.\n\nAlternative: ""CEMENT"": too long? No, 5 letters? ""CEMENT"" is 6? Not. How about ""CERES""? Not common.\n\nPerhaps it\'s easier to test the other position? Place E at position4 and R at position5? Since R cannot be position3? Or test E at position4.\n\nSimilarly, we can choose a word that fits Case 4: C _ _ E R? Like ""COWER"", ""COVER"", ""COMER"".\n\nOr Case 3: C _ R E D? Like ""CURED"", ""CRIED"", ""CROME"" not? ""CRUEL""? But L is out? So L not allowed? ""CRUEL"" has L? Avoid.\n\nWords for Case 3: C _ R E _ \nValid English words without L, K, A, N: ""CREDO""? ""CREDO"" is C R E D O -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:E, 4:D, 5:O? But wait, R at position2? We know R cannot be in position2! From guess1? Guess1: R in pos2 was marked wrong? So secret R not position2? Therefore in ""CREDO"", R is at position2? Not allowed? So words for Case 3 must have R at position3? As in C ? R E ?\n\nSo: position 2 must be one letter, R at position3, E at position4? Then position5? \n\nPossible: ""C U R E D"" -> ""CURED"" (as I thought earlier)\nOr ""C I R E D""? ""CIRED"" not a word?\nOr ""C A R E D""? A excluded? Cannot use A.\nOr ""C O R E D"" -> ""CORED""\nOr ""C T R E D""? Not common.\nOr ""C H R E W""? ""CHREW"" not word.\nBest: ""CORED"" or ""CURED""? Both valid?\n\nSimilarly for Case 4: C ? ? E R -> ""COPER"", ""COVER"", ""COWER"", ""CAVER"" A? Excluded? Or ""CITER""?\n\nBack to our guess: we need to make a third guess that tests some of these.\n\nA good approach: we can guess ""CORED"": ""CORED"" means C O R E D? But positions: \n1:C (fixed), 2:O, 3:R, 4:E, 5:D\n\nCheck constraints:\nFor E: if the secret has E in position4, then we get it? And for R in position3? Similarly? Also, we can get new information? \n\nBut wait, we know E cannot be in position3? From guess2? Guess2 ""clerk"" had E at position3, marked -, so E not position3? Similarly, E not position5? So E must be pos2 or pos4? In ""CORED"", E is at position4.\n\nAnd R: we know not position2? And not position4? So R in position3? That fits? Because in ""CORED"", R is at position3? \n\nSo if secret has R at position3? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if R is not at position3, then we get \'-\'. But note, R must be in position3 or position5? So if R not at3, it must be at5? \n\nSimilarly, for E: if E at position4? Then ✓? Else, if E at position2, then we get \'-\'? \n\nBut secret word: if it has E at position4 and R at position3? Then ""CORED"" is a candidate? \n\nSimilarly, ""CURED"" is another? Both have R at position3.\n\nBut what if R is at position5? For example, secret word ""C O V E R"" -> ""COVER"", then R is at position5? \n\nWhen we guess ""CORED"": \nIf secret is ""COVER"", then we get:\nPosition1: C ✓\nPosition2: O? Secret position2: V? Not O? But O might be absent? So:\n- Position1: C ✓ \n- Position2: O: ? secret has O? ""COVER"" does not have O? So O would be marked x? \n- Position3: R: secret has R at position5? So R is in word? But position3: secret has V? Not R? So R: -\n- Position4: E: secret position4: E? So ✓ \n- Position5: D? Secret position5: R? Not D? So D: x\n\nAnd if secret is ""CURED"": \n- Position1: C ✓ \n- Position2: O? Secret position2: U? Not O? So O: ?\n- Position3: R: secret position3: R? So ✓ \n- Position4: E: secret position4: E? ✓ \n- Position5: D: secret position5: D? ✓ \n\nOnly if both R and E positions match? \n\nBut if secret is ""COVER"" (with R at5), then R at3 in ""CORED"" would get \'-\'.\n\nWe have also other possibilities.\n\nTo get more letters, we can guess ""CORED"".\n\nAnother candidate: ""COWER"" or ""COVER""? But ""COVER"" does not have R at position3? \n\nPerhaps we can also guess ""CUTER"": C U T E R? But E at position4? R at position5? So positions: \n1:C, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R\n\nAnd we haven\'t used U, T? \n\nIn guess2 we had ""clerk"", E was at3? Not E at4.\n\nPotential: \nIf secret E at position4? Then we get ✓? \nIf secret R at position5? Then we get ✓?\n\nBut what if secret E at position2? Then E at position4 in guess would get \'-\', etc.\n\nAlso, T and U are new letters.\n\nBut ""CUTER"" might not be common? But accepted as a word.\n\nLet\'s choose: ""CURED"" is a possible word? We can guess it? But it might be the answer? So if we guess and it\'s wrong, we get feed? \n\nBetter to guess a word with new letters? \n\n""SCARE""? Starts with S? Cannot? Position1 must be C? Fixed? No? Start must be C? Because we have C at1 fixed? So all guesses must start with C? Because position1 is C? Yes.\n\nSo every guess must start with C? Because it will be ✓ if correct? And we know it is? \n\nTherefore, guess starts with C? Must: C _ _ _ _\n\nNow, with the constraints, let me design a guess.\n\nConsider placing E at position4? To see if E is at that position? Similarly, place R at position? We can\'t place R at position5 because we haven\'t tested? Or place R at position3? Which is one option.\n\nIf we place R at position5? Then we get: if secret R at position5, ✓, else - if R at position3? But R at position3 or5? If not at5, must be at3? So we can get info? \n\nSimilarly, place E at position2? So guess: C E ? ? R? But what letters? With avoid L,K,A,N? And the ? can be any letters.\n\nBut to have a valid word? Like ""C E D A R"" has A? Excluded? ""C E I L R""? L excluded? ""C E M E R""? Could be ""CEMER""? Not common? ""CEORL""? Not.\n\nPerhaps ""C E T Y R""? Not word? Not easy? \n\nSo maybe placing E at position4 is feasible? \n\nGuess: ""COVER"" -> C O V E R? \nPositions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R\n\nNow, this:\n- Tests E at position4? If E is at pos4, we get ✓? Else if E is at pos2, then E at4 will be -\n- Tests R at position5? If R at5, ✓? Else if R at3, then R at5 will be -? Because R is still in the word.\n\nAlso, introduces O, V as new letters? If any of them are in the word? We can get feedback.\n\nSo I think ""COVER"" is a good guess? \n\nAnother possibility: ""CUTER""? C U T E R? Same structure? E at4? R at5? \n\n""COVER"" is more common? \n\nAlso, ""COMER"" is less common? \n\nBut we must check if it fits: in ""COVER"", E at position4 and R at position5? Which are possible? \n\nIf the secret word has E at position4 and R at position5? Then we get all? ✓? \n\nIf not, we get partial.\n\nAlso, the word might be? \n\nSince we have used O and V? Or not? \n\nSo for guess3, I choose ""COVER"".\n\nLet\'s see what happens if secret has E at position2? For example, secret word ""CE R something?""? But we cannot find words? \n\nBut if secret is ""C E R T S""? But not a word? Or ""C E R G E""? Not 5 letters? So E at position2? R at position3? Then position4 and 5 need letters? E.g., ""CERNE""? Not? ""CERED""? Not? ""CEBID""? Not common? \n\nSimilarly, E at position2 and R at position5: ""CELER""? L excluded? ""CEDER""? Not A? ""CETYL""? Not common? I think E at position2 might be less common? Plus, we haven\'t tested position2 with E? So by placing E in position4, we can test position4? \n\nSimilarly, R in position5.\n\nSo ""COVER"" is suitable.\n\nTherefore, our third guess will be ""COVER"".\n\n<guess>cover</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** C(✓), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n  - This indicates that ""C"" is correct and in position 1.\n  - ""R"" and ""E"" are in the word but not in positions 2 and 5, respectively.\n  - ""A"" and ""N"" are not in the word and can be excluded.\n\n- **Guess 2 (""clerk""):** C(✓), L(x), E(-), R(-), K(x)\n  - This confirms ""C"" is fixed at position 1.\n  - ""E"" is in the word but not in position 3 (since E at position 3 was marked wrong).\n  - ""R"" is in the word but not in position 4 (since R at position 4 was marked wrong).\n  - ""L"" and ""K"" are not in the word and can be excluded.\n\nKey deductions:\n- Position 1: Must be ""C"".\n- Possible positions for ""E"": Positions 2 or 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).\n- Possible positions for ""R"": Positions 3 or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).\n- Eliminated letters: A, N, L, K. Any new guess must avoid these.\n- The word must include ""R"" and ""E"", and two unknown letters from the remaining English alphabet (excluding A, N, L, K).\n\nFor the third guess, choose a word that:\n- Starts with ""C"".\n- Places ""E"" in position 4 (to test for E at position 4) and ""R"" in position 5 (to test for R at position 5).\n- Introduces new common letters to gather more information.\n- Avoids eliminated letters (A, N, L, K).\n\n""COVER"" fits these requirements:\n- C (position 1): Known correct.\n- O (position 2): New letter (untested vowel).\n- V (position 3): New letter (common consonant).\n- E (position 4): Tests if E is in position 4.\n- R (position 5): Tests if R is in position 5.\n\nThis guess will provide feedback to narrow down the positions of E and R and reveal if O or V are in the word.\n\n<guess>cover</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: clerk -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) E(-) R(-) K(x)\nGuess 3: cover -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the third guess ""cover"":
- C: ✓ (correct position, as expected)
- O: x (not in the word)
- V: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position at 4)
- R: ✓ (correct position at 5)

This tells us:
- The secret word has E in position 4 and R in position 5.
- O and V are not in the word.

So the secret word is: C _ _ E R

We know:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)
- Position 2 and 3 are unknown, but we know:
  - The letters in position 2 and 3 must be from the remaining alphabet excluding A, N, L, K, O, V (since these are eliminated).
  - Also, the word must be a valid English word.

From previous feedback, we have eliminated: A, N, L, K, O, V.

We also know that the word contains exactly these five letters: C, ?, ?, E, R.

We need to find the two missing letters for positions 2 and 3.

Possible letters: all letters except A, N, L, K, O, V, and also excluding C, E, R (since they are already placed, but note that the two missing letters could be duplicates? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, and in the feedback we haven't seen any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now? However, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, it can be marked multiple times? But in our case, we haven't encountered that.

But to be safe, we should consider that the two missing letters are distinct and not C, E, R.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word of the form C ? ? E R.

Common English words that fit this pattern:
- C U T E R? ""CUTER"" -> but we haven't tested U and T? And it's a valid word.
- C I T E R? ""CITER"" (one who cites) is a word? Less common.
- C A T E R? But A is eliminated? Cannot.
- C O T E R? O is eliminated? Cannot.
- C U R E R? But R repeated? And we have R at position5? But position3 would be R? Then we have two R's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback for guess1 and guess2, we didn't have duplicates? But let's see: if there were duplicates, the feedback might show multiple marks? But in this case, we haven't seen that? So perhaps no duplicates? But we can't rule out? However, to be efficient, we can avoid duplicates for now? But ""CURER"" has two R's? And we have R at position5? So if we guess ""CURER"", we might get feedback on R? But we already know R is at position5? So if there is another R? But we don't know? But in the first guess, we had R in position2? And it was marked as present but wrong position? But that doesn't tell us if there is only one R? Similarly, in guess2, R in position4? Marked as present but wrong position? And now we have R at position5? So if the secret word has only one R, then in guess3 we got R at position5? Correct? So if we guess a word with two R's? It might be invalid? Or it might be that the secret has two R's? But we have no evidence? So to be safe, we should avoid assuming duplicates? But we can consider both? However, for the next guess, we can try a word without duplicates? 

But let's list possible words without duplicates? 

Common words: 
- ""CUTER"": C U T E R -> positions: 2:U, 3:T
- ""CITER"": C I T E R -> 2:I, 3:T
- ""CYBER"": C Y B E R -> 2:Y, 3:B
- ""CEDER"": but E at position4? And D? But ""CEDER"" is not common? And we have E at position4? But ""CEDER"" has two E's? If we consider? But E is at position4? And position2 is E? Then it would be duplicate? But we don't know? But ""CEDER"" is not a standard word? ""Cedar"" is with A? Excluded.
- ""COMER"": O excluded? Cannot.
- ""COWER"": O excluded? Cannot.
- ""CAKER""? Not a word? And K excluded? 
- ""CAGER""? A excluded? 
- ""CUBER"": C U B E R -> 2:U, 3:B? Valid? ""Cuber"" (one who cubes) is a word? Less common? 
- ""CUTER"" is more common? 

Also, ""CYBER"" is common? 

But we have to avoid O and V? So ""CYBER"" is possible? 

Another: ""CATER"" excluded? 

""CAVER"" excluded? 

""COVER"" we already guessed? 

So possible: ""CUTER"", ""CYBER"", ""CITER"", ""CUBER"", etc.

Now, we have to choose one? But we have only two positions to guess? And we have 6 tries? So we can guess one? And if wrong, we have more? But we want to maximize information? Or just solve? 

Since we have two positions, we can guess a word that uses two new letters? And if we get feedback, we can deduce? 

For example, if we guess ""CUTER"": 
- If the secret is ""CUTER"", we get all ✓? 
- If not, we get feedback on U and T? 

Similarly for ""CYBER"": we get feedback on Y and B? 

But we don't know which one? 

Alternatively, we can think about the most common letters? 

But we have used many consonants? 

We can also consider: in the first guess, we had E? And now we have E at position4? So the E in the first guess was at position5? Which was wrong? But we don't have information about other vowels? 

We have not used U, I, Y? Vowels? 

So ""CUTER"" uses U and T? 
""CYBER"" uses Y and B? 
""CITER"" uses I and T? 

T is common? 

But we have no information about T? 

Similarly, U, I, Y? 

We can choose ""CUTER"" because it's a common word? 

But note: we have to avoid eliminated letters? 

Another word: ""CUPER""? Not common? 

""SUPER"" doesn't start with C? 

I think ""CUTER"" is a good candidate? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

If we guess ""CUTER"" and the secret is not ""CUTER"", then we get:
- Position1: C ✓ 
- Position2: U: if U is in the word? If not, x? 
- Position3: T: if T is in the word? 
- Position4: E ✓ 
- Position5: R ✓ 

Then we can deduce the word? 

Similarly, if we guess ""CYBER"", same? 

But we have to choose one? 

Since we have two positions, and we are at guess4, we can try one? 

But to be efficient, we can choose a word that has letters that are common? 

T is more common than Y? So ""CUTER"" might be better? 

Also, U is a vowel? 

But we have no information about U? 

Alternatively, we can think: are there other words? 

What about ""CHEER""? But H? And E repeated? But we don't know? And H is not eliminated? But ""CHEER"" has E at position3 and position4? But position4 is E? And position3 is E? But we have E at position4? And if we have E at position3? But in guess2, we had E at position3? And it was marked as not in position3? So E cannot be at position3? Therefore, ""CHEER"" would have E at position3? Which is invalid? So we cannot have E at position3? So ""CHEER"" is not possible? Because it would require E at position3? But we know E is not at position3? 

Similarly, any word with E at position3 is invalid? 

So we are safe? 

Therefore, I choose ""CUTER"" as the fourth guess? 

But let's confirm: ""CUTER"" is C U T E R? Positions: 2:U, 3:T? 

Yes? 

So <guess>cuteR</guess>? But we write as ""CUTER""? 

But in the response, we write the word? 

But note: we have to return in the format: <guess>cuteR</guess>? No, the word is ""CUTER"". 

But in the feedback, we have to write the word? 

So I think ""CUTER"" is fine? 

But what if the secret is ""CYBER""? Then we get U and T wrong? 

But we can then guess ""CYBER"" next? 

But we have two guesses left? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses more common letters? But we have only two positions? 

Another idea: we can guess a word that has the same pattern but with different letters? But we don't have many options? 

But I think ""CUTER"" is a reasonable guess? 

So I'll go with that? 

But let's see: we have eliminated O and V? So available letters? 

Perhaps we can list all possible words? 

C ? ? E R 

With ? not in {A, N, L, K, O, V} and not C, E, R? 

Possible words: 
- Using B: ""CYBER"" (Y and B), ""CUBER"" (U and B) 
- Using D: ""CIDER"" (I and D) 
- Using F: ""CUFER""? Not word? 
- Using G: ""CAGER""? A excluded? ""CIGER""? Not? 
- Using H: ""CHER""? Not 5? ""CHOER""? O excluded? ""CHIER""? Not common? 
- Using I: ""CITER"" (I and T), ""CIDER"" (I and D) 
- Using M: ""CIMER""? Not? 
- Using P: ""CAPER""? A excluded? ""CIPER""? Not? 
- Using Q: ""CIQER""? Not? 
- Using S: ""CUSER""? Not? ""CASER""? A? 
- Using T: ""CUTER"" (U and T), ""CITER"" (I and T), ""CATER"" A excluded? 
- Using U: ""CUTER"", ""CUBER"" 
- Using W: ""CUWER""? Not? 
- Using X: ""CUXER""? Not? 
- Using Y: ""CYBER"" (Y and B), ""CYDER""? Not common? 
- Using Z: ""CUZER""? Not? 

So common words: 
- ""CUTER"" 
- ""CYBER"" 
- ""CIDER"" 
- ""CITER"" 
- ""CUBER"" (less common) 

Among these, ""CUTER"", ""CIDER"", ""CYBER"" are common? 

We can choose ""CUTER"" to test U and T? 

But if we guess ""CUTER"" and it's not correct, then we get feedback: 
- If U is in the word? 
- If T is in the word? 

Then we can deduce? 

For example, if U is in the word, then it must be at position2? Because the word is C _ _ E R? And if U is in the word, it must be at position2? Similarly, T at position3? 

But if U is not in the word, then position2 is not U? 

Similarly for T? 

Then we can try another word? 

But we have two guesses left? 

So it's acceptable? 

To cover more, we could choose a word with letters that appear in multiple possibilities? But it's hard? 

For example, ""CITER"" has I and T? But T is in ""CUTER"" and ""CITER""? 

But we don't know? 

I think ""CUTER"" is fine? 

So let's guess ""CUTER"". 

<guess>cuteR</guess>? No, the word is ""CUTER"". 

In the response, we write the word as ""CUTER"". 

But in the format: <guess>CUTER</guess> 

But let's write it properly. 

But note: in the feedback, we have to write the word? 

So I think: 

<guess>cuteR</guess> is not? We write the whole word? 

In the example, it was ""crane"", ""clerk"", etc? 

So we write ""CUTER"". 

But to be safe, we write it in uppercase? Or lowercase? The previous were lowercase? 

In the user message, it was ""crane"", ""clerk"", ""cover""? So lowercase? 

So we write ""cuteR""? No, the word is ""cuter""? 

""CUTER"" in lowercase is ""cuter""? 

Yes? 

So <guess>cuter</guess> 

But let's confirm: the word is ""cuter""? 

Yes. 

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  - C is in position 1 and correct.
  - R and E are in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, respectively.
  - A and N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2 (""clerk""):** C(✓) L(x) E(-) R(-) K(x)  
  - C is confirmed in position 1.
  - E is in the word but not in position 3.
  - R is in the word but not in position 4.
  - L and K are not in the word.

- **Guess 3 (""cover""):** C(✓) O(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)  
  - C, E, and R are correct and in positions 1, 4, and 5, respectively.
  - O and V are not in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word is of the form: `C _ _ E R` (positions: 1=C, 4=E, 5=R).
- Position 2 and 3 are unknown and must be filled with letters not yet eliminated.
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): A, N, L, K, O, V.
- The word must include only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (no duplicates, as no feedback indicated duplicates so far).
- Common words fitting this pattern include ""cuter"" (C U T E R), ""cyber"" (C Y B E R), ""cider"" (C I D E R), and ""citer"" (C I T E R).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test ""cuter"" to check if U and T are in positions 2 and 3. This is a common word that uses high-frequency letters (U is a vowel, T is a common consonant) and provides immediate feedback on two new letters.
- If ""cuter"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal whether U or T are in the word and/or in the correct positions, narrowing down the possibilities for the final guess.

<guess>cuter</guess>",cuteR,"We have feedback from the third guess ""cover"":
- C: ✓ (correct position, as expected)
- O: x (not in the word)
- V: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position at 4)
- R: ✓ (correct position at 5)

This tells us:
- The secret word has E in position 4 and R in position 5.
- O and V are not in the word.

So the secret word is: C _ _ E R

We know:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)
- Position 2 and 3 are unknown, but we know:
  - The letters in position 2 and 3 must be from the remaining alphabet excluding A, N, L, K, O, V (since these are eliminated).
  - Also, the word must be a valid English word.

From previous feedback, we have eliminated: A, N, L, K, O, V.

We also know that the word contains exactly these five letters: C, ?, ?, E, R.

We need to find the two missing letters for positions 2 and 3.

Possible letters: all letters except A, N, L, K, O, V, and also excluding C, E, R (since they are already placed, but note that the two missing letters could be duplicates? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, and in the feedback we haven't seen any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now? However, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, it can be marked multiple times? But in our case, we haven't encountered that.

But to be safe, we should consider that the two missing letters are distinct and not C, E, R.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word of the form C ? ? E R.

Common English words that fit this pattern:
- C U T E R? ""CUTER"" -> but we haven't tested U and T? And it's a valid word.
- C I T E R? ""CITER"" (one who cites) is a word? Less common.
- C A T E R? But A is eliminated? Cannot.
- C O T E R? O is eliminated? Cannot.
- C U R E R? But R repeated? And we have R at position5? But position3 would be R? Then we have two R's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback for guess1 and guess2, we didn't have duplicates? But let's see: if there were duplicates, the feedback might show multiple marks? But in this case, we haven't seen that? So perhaps no duplicates? But we can't rule out? However, to be efficient, we can avoid duplicates for now? But ""CURER"" has two R's? And we have R at position5? So if we guess ""CURER"", we might get feedback on R? But we already know R is at position5? So if there is another R? But we don't know? But in the first guess, we had R in position2? And it was marked as present but wrong position? But that doesn't tell us if there is only one R? Similarly, in guess2, R in position4? Marked as present but wrong position? And now we have R at position5? So if the secret word has only one R, then in guess3 we got R at position5? Correct? So if we guess a word with two R's? It might be invalid? Or it might be that the secret has two R's? But we have no evidence? So to be safe, we should avoid assuming duplicates? But we can consider both? However, for the next guess, we can try a word without duplicates? 

But let's list possible words without duplicates? 

Common words: 
- ""CUTER"": C U T E R -> positions: 2:U, 3:T
- ""CITER"": C I T E R -> 2:I, 3:T
- ""CYBER"": C Y B E R -> 2:Y, 3:B
- ""CEDER"": but E at position4? And D? But ""CEDER"" is not common? And we have E at position4? But ""CEDER"" has two E's? If we consider? But E is at position4? And position2 is E? Then it would be duplicate? But we don't know? But ""CEDER"" is not a standard word? ""Cedar"" is with A? Excluded.
- ""COMER"": O excluded? Cannot.
- ""COWER"": O excluded? Cannot.
- ""CAKER""? Not a word? And K excluded? 
- ""CAGER""? A excluded? 
- ""CUBER"": C U B E R -> 2:U, 3:B? Valid? ""Cuber"" (one who cubes) is a word? Less common? 
- ""CUTER"" is more common? 

Also, ""CYBER"" is common? 

But we have to avoid O and V? So ""CYBER"" is possible? 

Another: ""CATER"" excluded? 

""CAVER"" excluded? 

""COVER"" we already guessed? 

So possible: ""CUTER"", ""CYBER"", ""CITER"", ""CUBER"", etc.

Now, we have to choose one? But we have only two positions to guess? And we have 6 tries? So we can guess one? And if wrong, we have more? But we want to maximize information? Or just solve? 

Since we have two positions, we can guess a word that uses two new letters? And if we get feedback, we can deduce? 

For example, if we guess ""CUTER"": 
- If the secret is ""CUTER"", we get all ✓? 
- If not, we get feedback on U and T? 

Similarly for ""CYBER"": we get feedback on Y and B? 

But we don't know which one? 

Alternatively, we can think about the most common letters? 

But we have used many consonants? 

We can also consider: in the first guess, we had E? And now we have E at position4? So the E in the first guess was at position5? Which was wrong? But we don't have information about other vowels? 

We have not used U, I, Y? Vowels? 

So ""CUTER"" uses U and T? 
""CYBER"" uses Y and B? 
""CITER"" uses I and T? 

T is common? 

But we have no information about T? 

Similarly, U, I, Y? 

We can choose ""CUTER"" because it's a common word? 

But note: we have to avoid eliminated letters? 

Another word: ""CUPER""? Not common? 

""SUPER"" doesn't start with C? 

I think ""CUTER"" is a good candidate? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

If we guess ""CUTER"" and the secret is not ""CUTER"", then we get:
- Position1: C ✓ 
- Position2: U: if U is in the word? If not, x? 
- Position3: T: if T is in the word? 
- Position4: E ✓ 
- Position5: R ✓ 

Then we can deduce the word? 

Similarly, if we guess ""CYBER"", same? 

But we have to choose one? 

Since we have two positions, and we are at guess4, we can try one? 

But to be efficient, we can choose a word that has letters that are common? 

T is more common than Y? So ""CUTER"" might be better? 

Also, U is a vowel? 

But we have no information about U? 

Alternatively, we can think: are there other words? 

What about ""CHEER""? But H? And E repeated? But we don't know? And H is not eliminated? But ""CHEER"" has E at position3 and position4? But position4 is E? And position3 is E? But we have E at position4? And if we have E at position3? But in guess2, we had E at position3? And it was marked as not in position3? So E cannot be at position3? Therefore, ""CHEER"" would have E at position3? Which is invalid? So we cannot have E at position3? So ""CHEER"" is not possible? Because it would require E at position3? But we know E is not at position3? 

Similarly, any word with E at position3 is invalid? 

So we are safe? 

Therefore, I choose ""CUTER"" as the fourth guess? 

But let's confirm: ""CUTER"" is C U T E R? Positions: 2:U, 3:T? 

Yes? 

So <guess>cuteR</guess>? But we write as ""CUTER""? 

But in the response, we write the word? 

But note: we have to return in the format: <guess>cuteR</guess>? No, the word is ""CUTER"". 

But in the feedback, we have to write the word? 

So I think ""CUTER"" is fine? 

But what if the secret is ""CYBER""? Then we get U and T wrong? 

But we can then guess ""CYBER"" next? 

But we have two guesses left? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses more common letters? But we have only two positions? 

Another idea: we can guess a word that has the same pattern but with different letters? But we don't have many options? 

But I think ""CUTER"" is a reasonable guess? 

So I'll go with that? 

But let's see: we have eliminated O and V? So available letters? 

Perhaps we can list all possible words? 

C ? ? E R 

With ? not in {A, N, L, K, O, V} and not C, E, R? 

Possible words: 
- Using B: ""CYBER"" (Y and B), ""CUBER"" (U and B) 
- Using D: ""CIDER"" (I and D) 
- Using F: ""CUFER""? Not word? 
- Using G: ""CAGER""? A excluded? ""CIGER""? Not? 
- Using H: ""CHER""? Not 5? ""CHOER""? O excluded? ""CHIER""? Not common? 
- Using I: ""CITER"" (I and T), ""CIDER"" (I and D) 
- Using M: ""CIMER""? Not? 
- Using P: ""CAPER""? A excluded? ""CIPER""? Not? 
- Using Q: ""CIQER""? Not? 
- Using S: ""CUSER""? Not? ""CASER""? A? 
- Using T: ""CUTER"" (U and T), ""CITER"" (I and T), ""CATER"" A excluded? 
- Using U: ""CUTER"", ""CUBER"" 
- Using W: ""CUWER""? Not? 
- Using X: ""CUXER""? Not? 
- Using Y: ""CYBER"" (Y and B), ""CYDER""? Not common? 
- Using Z: ""CUZER""? Not? 

So common words: 
- ""CUTER"" 
- ""CYBER"" 
- ""CIDER"" 
- ""CITER"" 
- ""CUBER"" (less common) 

Among these, ""CUTER"", ""CIDER"", ""CYBER"" are common? 

We can choose ""CUTER"" to test U and T? 

But if we guess ""CUTER"" and it's not correct, then we get feedback: 
- If U is in the word? 
- If T is in the word? 

Then we can deduce? 

For example, if U is in the word, then it must be at position2? Because the word is C _ _ E R? And if U is in the word, it must be at position2? Similarly, T at position3? 

But if U is not in the word, then position2 is not U? 

Similarly for T? 

Then we can try another word? 

But we have two guesses left? 

So it's acceptable? 

To cover more, we could choose a word with letters that appear in multiple possibilities? But it's hard? 

For example, ""CITER"" has I and T? But T is in ""CUTER"" and ""CITER""? 

But we don't know?

So let's guess ""CUTER"". 

<guess>cuteR</guess>? No, the word is ""CUTER"".

""CUTER"" in lowercase is ""cuter""? 

Yes? 

So <guess>cuter</guess> 

But let's confirm: the word is ""cuter""? 

Yes. 

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  - C is in position 1 and correct.
  - R and E are in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, respectively.
  - A and N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2 (""clerk""):** C(✓) L(x) E(-) R(-) K(x)  
  - C is confirmed in position 1.
  - E is in the word but not in position 3.
  - R is in the word but not in position 4.
  - L and K are not in the word.

- **Guess 3 (""cover""):** C(✓) O(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)

  - O and V are not in the word.

### Deductions:

- Position 2 and 3 are unknown and must be filled with letters not yet eliminated.
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): A, N, L, K, O, V.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,cider,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓
- R: -
- A: x
- N: x
- E: -

Interpretation:
- C is correct and in the right position (position 1). So the secret word starts with C.
- R is in the word but not in position 2. So R is somewhere else in the word.
- A is not in the word at all.
- N is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed in the last position).

Therefore, the secret word:
- Starts with C.
- Contains R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively (and also not A or N).
- R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

We have 5 positions: 1: C (fixed), 2: ? (not R, not A, not N), 3: ?, 4: ?, 5: ? (not E).

Letters known to be in the word: C, R, E (C is fixed at position 1).

Letters not in the word: A, N.

Since E is in the word but not at position 5, it must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4. But note that position 2 cannot be E because the feedback for R was that it's in the word but not in position 2, but it doesn't restrict E. However, we don't know if E can be in position 2 yet.

Similarly, R must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is not R).

We need to make a second guess that:
- Is a 5-letter word starting with C (since position 1 must be C).
- Does not contain A or N (since they are not in the word).
- Must include R and E (because we know they are in the word), but we don't know their positions yet.

We also want to test possible positions for R and E, and perhaps get information about the other letters.

Possible structure for the second guess:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: Some letter that is not A, N (and not R because R can't be there), but we don't know what is allowed. We can choose a common consonant.
- We need to include R and E in positions 3,4, or 5 (but not necessarily both; we already know they are in the word, so we must include them to check positions).

Alternatively, we can try to place R and E in different positions to test.

But note: We cannot reuse A or N, so our word must consist of letters excluding A and N.

List of possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we know the word has R and E).

We must include R and E in the word, but avoid A and N.

Additionally, we want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Let me think of words that start with C, contain R and E, and no A or N.

Some options:
- ""CREPT"": C, R, E, P, T -> but E in position 3? We don't know.
- ""CRWTH"" - not a common word.
- ""CREST"": C, R, E, S, T -> this is common. Let's check: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:E, 4:S, 5:T.

But note: Feedback for first guess said R is not in position 2. So if we guess ""CREST"", R is in position 2. But wait, in the secret word, R is not in position 2. So if we guess ""CREST"", we expect that R in position 2 would be marked as wrong (either '-' or 'x')? Actually, since we know R is in the word but not position 2, if we put R in position 2 we'll get a '-' for R (meaning it's in the word but wrong position), but we already know that.

Alternatively, we can avoid putting R in position 2 since we know it's incorrect, so that we can test other positions.

But let's see: if we guess ""CREST"", we place R in position 2 (which we know is wrong) and E in position 3.

If the secret word has E in position 3, then we get a ✓ for E at position 3. Otherwise, we might get a '-' if E is in the word but not position 3, or 'x' but we know E is in the word so it can't be 'x'.

Actually, we know E is in the word, so if E is not in position 3, we get '-'.

Similarly, for R: we know R is in the word, and if we put it in position 2, we'll get '-' because we know it's not position 2.

But we can also try to place R in a different position.

Another idea: place R in position 3 or 4 or 5 to see if it gets ✓.

For example, let's try to make a word with C at 1, E at 2 (but is E allowed at position 2? We don't know yet), and R at 3,4 or 5.

We need to consider: the feedback told us E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 2,3, or 4.

Similarly, R can be at position 3,4, or 5.

So, let's choose a word that places E in a new position, say position 2, and R in position 3,4, or 5.

But note: the secret word has 5 letters and we know C (position1), R, E, and two more letters.

We don't know the other two letters.

Word: ""CEDAR"" - but we cannot use A (since A is not in the word), so avoid A.

Word: ""CHERT"" - C, H, E, R, T -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:R, 5:T.

That might be a good one: it avoids position 2 for R (we put R at 4) and E at position 3. Also, we test H and T.

Another option: ""CREPT"" - C, R, E, P, T -> but R is at position 2? We know R is not at position 2, so putting R at position 2 would be a waste because we know it's wrong.

So, let's avoid putting R in position 2.

Similarly, in ""CREST"", R is at position 2, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid that.

Better to try a word that has R in a different position.

Options:
- ""CERES"" - not a common word.
- ""CODER"" - C, O, D, E, R -> but E is at position 4 and R at position 5. Also, O, D are new.

But note: position 1 is C, position 2 is O, position 3 is D, position 4 is E, position 5 is R.

This places E at position 4 and R at position 5.

We know E is not at position 5, but can be at 4. Similarly, R not at 2, but can be at 5.

Also, we don't use A or N.

So, ""CODER"" is a valid word? Yes, in programming, but also in English as a noun (one who codes). However, it might be accepted.

But perhaps we can choose a more common word.

Another word: ""CUTER"" - C, U, T, E, R -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R.

This also avoids position 2 for R and position 5 for E (E is at position 4, R at position 5).

But we don't know if E can be at position 4 or R at position 5.

I think ""CUTER"" is acceptable.

But we also want to cover other common letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""CRUEL"": C, R, U, E, L -> but R is at position 2? No, if we structure it as 1:C, 2:R? Bad, because we know R is not at position 2.

We need to avoid position 2 for R.

How about ""CLERK"": C, L, E, R, K -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:R, 5:K.

This places E at position 3 and R at position 4.

And L and K are new.

This seems good because:
- Position 1: C (we know correct)
- Position 2: L (new)
- Position 3: E (if E is at position 3, we get ✓, if not we get '-' or ... but since E is in the word, it will be '-' if not at position 3)
- Position 4: R (if R is at position 4, we get ✓, else if R is elsewhere, we get '-')
- Position 5: K (new)

Also, no A, N.

Moreover, ""CLERK"" is a common word.

So, I think ""CLERK"" is a good candidate.

Another possibility: ""CRIMP"" - but R is at position 2? Avoid.

""CREME"" - but E repeated? And R at position 2? Avoid.

""COVER"" - C, O, V, E, R -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R -> same as before.

But ""CLERK"" is fine.

I'll go with ""CLERK"".

So, second guess: ""CLERK""

But note: we have to return it in the specified format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in the right position (✓ at position 1), so the secret word starts with ""C"".
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is not in the word (x), so it can be excluded.
- N is not in the word (x), so it can be excluded.
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
- The word starts with ""C"".
- The word contains ""R"" and ""E"", which must be placed in positions other than the ones guessed: R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
- A and N are not in the word, so the second guess must avoid these letters.

Since R and E could be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (with position 5 excluded for E), a strong second guess should:
- Start with ""C"".
- Include both ""R"" and ""E"" to test their possible positions.
- Avoid A and N.
- Use common letters to maximize information.

""CLERK"" is a good candidate:
- Position 1: C (fixed and correct).
- Position 2: L (new letter to test).
- Position 3: E (tests if E is in position 3).
- Position 4: R (tests if R is in position 4).
- Position 5: K (new letter to test).

This avoids known incorrect positions for R and E while covering new consonants like L and K.

<guess>clerk</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: clerk -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) E(-) R(-) K(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Second guess: ""clerK"" (capital K for emphasis, but it's a letter)
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- L: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- K: x (not in word)

From this, we know:

1. The word starts with C (position 1 is fixed).
2. The letters R and E are in the word, but neither was in their guessed positions:
   - In ""crane"", R was guessed in position 2 and E in position 5; both were marked wrong position.
   - In ""clerk"", E was guessed in position 3 and R in position 4; both were marked wrong position.

So we can deduce:
- R is not in positions 2, 3, or 4? Wait, no: we only know it's not in pos 2 (from guess1) and not in pos 4 (from guess2), and it might be in pos 3 or 5? But guess2 had R in pos 4, so it's not pos 4. And guess1 had R in pos 2, not pos 2. But we haven't tested pos 5 for R? So R could be in position 3 or 5? However, we don't have information about position 3 for R because in guess2 we tested E in position 3, not R.

Similarly for E:
- E is not in pos 5 (guess1) and not in pos 3 (guess2) because guess2 had E in pos3 and it was marked as '-', meaning it's not pos3. So E cannot be in positions 3 or 5? And we haven't tested position 2 for E? So possible positions for E are 2 or 4? And for R: we know not pos2 (guess1) and not pos4 (guess2), so R must be in pos3 (since pos1 is C) or pos5? But note: the secret word has exactly 5 positions.

Potential positions for R: 3 or 5? (because 2 and 4 are excluded)
But: position 1 is C, so R cannot be there.

Also, we know E is in the word but not pos3 or pos5? So E must be in pos2 or pos4.

Now, letters we have excluded from the word:
- A (from guess1)
- N (from guess1)
- L (from guess2)
- K (from guess2)

So the word contains:
- C (fixed at pos1)
- R
- E
- plus two other letters that are not A, N, L, or K.

Now, we have two unknowns: the two letters and the positions of R and E.

But note: we cannot have R and E in positions that are already excluded.

Possible configurations:

Let the word be: C _ _ _ _

Position 2: Either E or one of the other letters. But E can be pos2? We haven't tested pos2 for E? Actually, we have not guessed E in pos2 yet.

Similarly, position 3: we have not tested for R? But we tested for E in pos3 and it was wrong. But R could be in pos3? Yes.

Position 4: we tested R in pos4 and it was wrong, so R not at pos4.

Position 5: we tested E in pos5 and it was wrong? So E cannot be pos5.

Therefore:
- R must be in position 3 or 5? Because pos2 and pos4 are invalid for R.
- E must be in position 2 or 4? Because pos3 and pos5 are invalid for E.

But note: if R is in pos3, E could be pos2 or pos4. Similarly, if R is in pos5, E could be pos2 or pos4.

However, the position constraints must be considered with the rest of the word.

We also need to choose a third guess that uses the known information and gives us more clues.

We must avoid letters L, K, A, N.

We must include R and E? No, we already know they are in the word, so our guess must include them? Not necessarily, but we have only 6 guesses and we need to solve, so guessing a word without R or E would be bad because we won't get information about the positions? Or we might not include them to test other letters? But since we have limited guesses, it's better to include the known letters to confirm their positions? However, we know R and E are in the word, so we can try to place them in the possible positions that remain.

Possible positions for E: 2 or 4.
Possible positions for R: 3 or 5.

So that gives us four cases:

Case 1: E at 2, R at 3 -> word: C E R ? ?
Case 2: E at 2, R at 5 -> word: C E ? ? R
Case 3: E at 4, R at 3 -> word: C ? R E ?
Case 4: E at 4, R at 5 -> word: C ? ? E R

But each of these has two more letters to be determined? We have positions to fill.

For each case, we need a guess that fits one of these patterns? Or we can make a guess that tests one of these possibilities.

However, our guess must be a valid English word.

We also have to use letters that have not been eliminated: so letters excluding A, N, L, K.

But note: we haven't used many letters? We have used C, R, A, N, E, L, K? And the word must have two more letters? Unknown.

In guess1: ""crane"" letters: C,R,A,N,E
In guess2: ""clerk"": C,L,E,R,K

So covered letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, K

Eliminated letters: A, N, L, K

So remaining letters: all English vowels and consonants except A,N,L,K.

We should focus on common remaining letters: maybe vowels O, U? Or consonants B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But no A or N or L or K? So L and K are out? But in first guess E was present? And R.

Actually E and R are in, and C is fixed.

So for the word we need: starting with C, contains E and R (and E and R positions constrained), and two other letters from the remaining set of letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But specifically: avoid A, N, L, K.

Now, we can design a guess that fits one of the cases? Or tests multiple possibilities.

But note: if we guess a word with E in position 2, we can see if E is indeed in pos2? Similarly for R.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that places E in one of its possible positions and R in one of its, and also uses new letters to test.

But we have only one more guess to get information?

We need to cover more letters? Or constrain possibilities.

What are common words to guess?

First, let's list possible positions:

If we assume case 1: word like C E R _ _
What can fit? E.g., ""CERTS"" or ""CERTY""? Not valid? ""CERES"" not common? ""CERV""? Not 5.

But ""CERTY"" is not a word? ""CERTS"" no? ""CERT"" is 4; need 5 letters.

Actually, valid English words: ""CERTy"" -> ""CERTY"" is not standard? But ""CERTY"" no? Let me think: ""CERTS"" is not a common word? Better: ""CERED""? Not valid.

Instead, let's consider case 3 or case 4? What words exist?

Case 3: word C _ R E _
Possible: ""CURED"" (C _ R E _) -> positions:2:U, 5:D? But D is allowed? No A,N,L,K.
But ""CURED"" would be: position1:C, position2:U, position3:R, position4:E, position5:D.
In this case: U, R, E, D? But R is at position3? We have? U and E,D? But E at position4.

Now check against known: 
If secret word were ""CURED"":
- For guess1 ""crane"": position1: C? Yes and ✓? No: ""crane"" has C at1: ✓. R at2: secret has R at3? So R at2 not same? So R: in word, wrong position? That matches -. A at3: secret has U? So not A? A x matches? N at4: secret has E? So not N x? E at5: secret has D? So E? Secret has E at4? So E at5 is not correct? And E is in word? So E: -? Matches.

Guess2: ""clerk"": C ✓ L: secret has U? Not L? L x? E: at position3? Secret has E at4? So E in word wrong position? Hence -? R at position4? Secret has R at3? So R at4 is wrong? Hence -? K at5: secret has D? So K x? Matches the feedback? So ""CURED"" is entirely possible? 

But note: in guess2 we guessed ""clerk"" and got E at position3: -, but secret has E at position4? So indeed, E was guessed in pos3 (wrong) and R in pos4 (wrong)? And R is at pos3? So in guess2, we didn't have R at position3? We had R at position4? So position3 was E? And result was E: -? Because E is not at pos3? Correct.

Similarly, case 1: C E R _ _ 
What word? ""CERTs""? No? ""CERVS""? No? ""CERSE""? Not common? ""CERES"" is a name? Not common? ""CERTY"" not a word?

Another possibility: ""CERO""? Not 5 letters.

Case 2: C E _ _ R
Examples: ""CENTER""? Not because it has T,E,N? N is excluded? But N is not in? We have to avoid N? So ""CETER""? No? ""CEDER""? E? But E at position2, R at position5? ""CEDER"": C E D E R? But E at position2 and position4? Secret word could have two E's? But the feedback doesn't tell us duplicates? We don't know? Actually, we aren't told about duplicate letters? In feedback, if a letter appears in the secret multiple times? But let me check: in guess2 ""clerk"": we used E once? And got E:-, meaning E is not in position3? But if secret had two E's, then if E in position3 absent? But E might appear elsewhere? But generally, no indication? So possibility.

But ""CEDER"" is not common? ""CEDAR"" excluded because A? A is out? So no.

""CEILR""? Not English? Better: ""CELLR""? No? Not good.

Case 4: C _ _ E R
Examples: ""CATER"" -> C A T E R? But A is excluded? Cannot use A? ""COMER""? C O M E R? That could be? Avoid A,N,L,K? Yes? Also ""COVER"", ""COWER"", etc.

But we have case 3: C _ R E _ -> like ""CURED"", ""CRIED"", etc.

And our guess2 eliminated L and K? So we can form words with other letters.

But to get information faster, we should guess a word that will test the positions for E and R and also use new common letters? Also, we want to use letters that haven't been used? To see if they appear.

For example, we can guess a word that places E at position 2 and R at position 5? Or position3? Etc? But because of constraints?

Best: try to guess a word that fits Case 3 or Case 4? But we don't know which? So choose a guess that will distinguish? Or cover.

Proposal: guess a word that has E at position 2 (to test if E is at position 2) and R at one of its possible positions? Also? And new letters.

For example, let's try ""CATER"": but A excluded? Not possible? Avoid A.

So ""COMER""? But it might not be common? ""CODER""? D, O? But in guess2 we didn't have O or D? So ""CODER"": C O D E R -> E at position4? Not position2? Wait, position2 is O? Position4 is E.

If E is in position2? Then we need a word like ""C E _ _ _"".

For example, ""CEBID""? Not common? ""CEDAR"" excluded? ""CEILI""? No? ""CELLO"": C E L L O? But we know L is not in the word! Because in guess2, L was at position2? Eliminated with x? So if L is eliminated, we cannot use L? So ""CELLO"" is invalid? Cannot have L. Similarly, K is eliminated.

So we must avoid L.

Possible word with E in position2: ""CEASE""? But A and E? A is out? ""CEASE"" has A? No? If we avoid A? ""CEILI""? No? ""CENSE""? But N is out? ""CEORL""? Not English? This is hard.

Alternative: ""CEMENT"": too long? No, 5 letters? ""CEMENT"" is 6? Not. How about ""CERES""? Not common.

Perhaps it's easier to test the other position? Place E at position4 and R at position5? Since R cannot be position3? Or test E at position4.

Similarly, we can choose a word that fits Case 4: C _ _ E R? Like ""COWER"", ""COVER"", ""COMER"".

Or Case 3: C _ R E D? Like ""CURED"", ""CRIED"", ""CROME"" not? ""CRUEL""? But L is out? So L not allowed? ""CRUEL"" has L? Avoid.

Words for Case 3: C _ R E _ 
Valid English words without L, K, A, N: ""CREDO""? ""CREDO"" is C R E D O -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:E, 4:D, 5:O? But wait, R at position2? We know R cannot be in position2! From guess1? Guess1: R in pos2 was marked wrong? So secret R not position2? Therefore in ""CREDO"", R is at position2? Not allowed? So words for Case 3 must have R at position3? As in C ? R E ?

So: position 2 must be one letter, R at position3, E at position4? Then position5? 

Possible: ""C U R E D"" -> ""CURED"" (as I thought earlier)
Or ""C I R E D""? ""CIRED"" not a word?
Or ""C A R E D""? A excluded? Cannot use A.
Or ""C O R E D"" -> ""CORED""
Or ""C T R E D""? Not common.
Or ""C H R E W""? ""CHREW"" not word.
Best: ""CORED"" or ""CURED""? Both valid?

Similarly for Case 4: C ? ? E R -> ""COPER"", ""COVER"", ""COWER"", ""CAVER"" A? Excluded? Or ""CITER""?

Back to our guess: we need to make a third guess that tests some of these.

A good approach: we can guess ""CORED"": ""CORED"" means C O R E D? But positions: 
1:C (fixed), 2:O, 3:R, 4:E, 5:D

Check constraints:
For E: if the secret has E in position4, then we get it? And for R in position3? Similarly? Also, we can get new information? 

But wait, we know E cannot be in position3? From guess2? Guess2 ""clerk"" had E at position3, marked -, so E not position3? Similarly, E not position5? So E must be pos2 or pos4? In ""CORED"", E is at position4.

And R: we know not position2? And not position4? So R in position3? That fits? Because in ""CORED"", R is at position3? 

So if secret has R at position3? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if R is not at position3, then we get '-'. But note, R must be in position3 or position5? So if R not at3, it must be at5? 

Similarly, for E: if E at position4? Then ✓? Else, if E at position2, then we get '-'? 

But secret word: if it has E at position4 and R at position3? Then ""CORED"" is a candidate? 

Similarly, ""CURED"" is another? Both have R at position3.

But what if R is at position5? For example, secret word ""C O V E R"" -> ""COVER"", then R is at position5? 

When we guess ""CORED"": 
If secret is ""COVER"", then we get:
Position1: C ✓
Position2: O? Secret position2: V? Not O? But O might be absent? So:
- Position1: C ✓ 
- Position2: O: ? secret has O? ""COVER"" does not have O? So O would be marked x? 
- Position3: R: secret has R at position5? So R is in word? But position3: secret has V? Not R? So R: -
- Position4: E: secret position4: E? So ✓ 
- Position5: D? Secret position5: R? Not D? So D: x

And if secret is ""CURED"": 
- Position1: C ✓ 
- Position2: O? Secret position2: U? Not O? So O: ?
- Position3: R: secret position3: R? So ✓ 
- Position4: E: secret position4: E? ✓ 
- Position5: D: secret position5: D? ✓ 

Only if both R and E positions match? 

But if secret is ""COVER"" (with R at5), then R at3 in ""CORED"" would get '-'.

We have also other possibilities.

To get more letters, we can guess ""CORED"".

Another candidate: ""COWER"" or ""COVER""? But ""COVER"" does not have R at position3? 

Perhaps we can also guess ""CUTER"": C U T E R? But E at position4? R at position5? So positions: 
1:C, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R

And we haven't used U, T? 

In guess2 we had ""clerk"", E was at3? Not E at4.

Potential: 
If secret E at position4? Then we get ✓? 
If secret R at position5? Then we get ✓?

But what if secret E at position2? Then E at position4 in guess would get '-', etc.

Also, T and U are new letters.

But ""CUTER"" might not be common? But accepted as a word.

Let's choose: ""CURED"" is a possible word? We can guess it? But it might be the answer? So if we guess and it's wrong, we get feed? 

Better to guess a word with new letters? 

""SCARE""? Starts with S? Cannot? Position1 must be C? Fixed? No? Start must be C? Because we have C at1 fixed? So all guesses must start with C? Because position1 is C? Yes.

So every guess must start with C? Because it will be ✓ if correct? And we know it is? 

Therefore, guess starts with C? Must: C _ _ _ _

Now, with the constraints, let me design a guess.

Consider placing E at position4? To see if E is at that position? Similarly, place R at position? We can't place R at position5 because we haven't tested? Or place R at position3? Which is one option.

If we place R at position5? Then we get: if secret R at position5, ✓, else - if R at position3? But R at position3 or5? If not at5, must be at3? So we can get info? 

Similarly, place E at position2? So guess: C E ? ? R? But what letters? With avoid L,K,A,N? And the ? can be any letters.

But to have a valid word? Like ""C E D A R"" has A? Excluded? ""C E I L R""? L excluded? ""C E M E R""? Could be ""CEMER""? Not common? ""CEORL""? Not.

Perhaps ""C E T Y R""? Not word? Not easy? 

So maybe placing E at position4 is feasible? 

Guess: ""COVER"" -> C O V E R? 
Positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R

Now, this:
- Tests E at position4? If E is at pos4, we get ✓? Else if E is at pos2, then E at4 will be -
- Tests R at position5? If R at5, ✓? Else if R at3, then R at5 will be -? Because R is still in the word.

Also, introduces O, V as new letters? If any of them are in the word? We can get feedback.

So I think ""COVER"" is a good guess? 

Another possibility: ""CUTER""? C U T E R? Same structure? E at4? R at5? 

""COVER"" is more common? 

Also, ""COMER"" is less common? 

But we must check if it fits: in ""COVER"", E at position4 and R at position5? Which are possible? 

If the secret word has E at position4 and R at position5? Then we get all? ✓? 

If not, we get partial.

Also, the word might be? 

Since we have used O and V? Or not? 

So for guess3, I choose ""COVER"".

Let's see what happens if secret has E at position2? For example, secret word ""CE R something?""? But we cannot find words? 

But if secret is ""C E R T S""? But not a word? Or ""C E R G E""? Not 5 letters? So E at position2? R at position3? Then position4 and 5 need letters? E.g., ""CERNE""? Not? ""CERED""? Not? ""CEBID""? Not common? 

Similarly, E at position2 and R at position5: ""CELER""? L excluded? ""CEDER""? Not A? ""CETYL""? Not common? I think E at position2 might be less common? Plus, we haven't tested position2 with E? So by placing E in position4, we can test position4? 

Similarly, R in position5.

So ""COVER"" is suitable.

Therefore, our third guess will be ""COVER"".

<guess>cover</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** C(✓), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - This indicates that ""C"" is correct and in position 1.
  - ""R"" and ""E"" are in the word but not in positions 2 and 5, respectively.
  - ""A"" and ""N"" are not in the word and can be excluded.

- **Guess 2 (""clerk""):** C(✓), L(x), E(-), R(-), K(x)
  - This confirms ""C"" is fixed at position 1.
  - ""E"" is in the word but not in position 3 (since E at position 3 was marked wrong).
  - ""R"" is in the word but not in position 4 (since R at position 4 was marked wrong).
  - ""L"" and ""K"" are not in the word and can be excluded.

Key deductions:
- Position 1: Must be ""C"".
- Possible positions for ""E"": Positions 2 or 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).
- Possible positions for ""R"": Positions 3 or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).
- Eliminated letters: A, N, L, K. Any new guess must avoid these.
- The word must include ""R"" and ""E"", and two unknown letters from the remaining English alphabet (excluding A, N, L, K).

For the third guess, choose a word that:
- Starts with ""C"".
- Places ""E"" in position 4 (to test for E at position 4) and ""R"" in position 5 (to test for R at position 5).
- Introduces new common letters to gather more information.
- Avoids eliminated letters (A, N, L, K).

""COVER"" fits these requirements:
- C (position 1): Known correct.
- O (position 2): New letter (untested vowel).
- V (position 3): New letter (common consonant).
- E (position 4): Tests if E is in position 4.
- R (position 5): Tests if R is in position 5.

This guess will provide feedback to narrow down the positions of E and R and reveal if O or V are in the word.

<guess>cover</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: clerk -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) E(-) R(-) K(x)
Guess 3: cover -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the third guess ""cover"":
- C: ✓ (correct position, as expected)
- O: x (not in the word)
- V: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position at 4)
- R: ✓ (correct position at 5)

This tells us:
- The secret word has E in position 4 and R in position 5.
- O and V are not in the word.

So the secret word is: C _ _ E R

We know:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)
- Position 2 and 3 are unknown, but we know:
  - The letters in position 2 and 3 must be from the remaining alphabet excluding A, N, L, K, O, V (since these are eliminated).
  - Also, the word must be a valid English word.

From previous feedback, we have eliminated: A, N, L, K, O, V.

We also know that the word contains exactly these five letters: C, ?, ?, E, R.

We need to find the two missing letters for positions 2 and 3.

Possible letters: all letters except A, N, L, K, O, V, and also excluding C, E, R (since they are already placed, but note that the two missing letters could be duplicates? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, and in the feedback we haven't seen any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now? However, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, it can be marked multiple times? But in our case, we haven't encountered that.

But to be safe, we should consider that the two missing letters are distinct and not C, E, R.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word of the form C ? ? E R.

Common English words that fit this pattern:
- C U T E R? ""CUTER"" -> but we haven't tested U and T? And it's a valid word.
- C I T E R? ""CITER"" (one who cites) is a word? Less common.
- C A T E R? But A is eliminated? Cannot.
- C O T E R? O is eliminated? Cannot.
- C U R E R? But R repeated? And we have R at position5? But position3 would be R? Then we have two R's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback for guess1 and guess2, we didn't have duplicates? But let's see: if there were duplicates, the feedback might show multiple marks? But in this case, we haven't seen that? So perhaps no duplicates? But we can't rule out? However, to be efficient, we can avoid duplicates for now? But ""CURER"" has two R's? And we have R at position5? So if we guess ""CURER"", we might get feedback on R? But we already know R is at position5? So if there is another R? But we don't know? But in the first guess, we had R in position2? And it was marked as present but wrong position? But that doesn't tell us if there is only one R? Similarly, in guess2, R in position4? Marked as present but wrong position? And now we have R at position5? So if the secret word has only one R, then in guess3 we got R at position5? Correct? So if we guess a word with two R's? It might be invalid? Or it might be that the secret has two R's? But we have no evidence? So to be safe, we should avoid assuming duplicates? But we can consider both? However, for the next guess, we can try a word without duplicates? 

But let's list possible words without duplicates? 

Common words: 
- ""CUTER"": C U T E R -> positions: 2:U, 3:T
- ""CITER"": C I T E R -> 2:I, 3:T
- ""CYBER"": C Y B E R -> 2:Y, 3:B
- ""CEDER"": but E at position4? And D? But ""CEDER"" is not common? And we have E at position4? But ""CEDER"" has two E's? If we consider? But E is at position4? And position2 is E? Then it would be duplicate? But we don't know? But ""CEDER"" is not a standard word? ""Cedar"" is with A? Excluded.
- ""COMER"": O excluded? Cannot.
- ""COWER"": O excluded? Cannot.
- ""CAKER""? Not a word? And K excluded? 
- ""CAGER""? A excluded? 
- ""CUBER"": C U B E R -> 2:U, 3:B? Valid? ""Cuber"" (one who cubes) is a word? Less common? 
- ""CUTER"" is more common? 

Also, ""CYBER"" is common? 

But we have to avoid O and V? So ""CYBER"" is possible? 

Another: ""CATER"" excluded? 

""CAVER"" excluded? 

""COVER"" we already guessed? 

So possible: ""CUTER"", ""CYBER"", ""CITER"", ""CUBER"", etc.

Now, we have to choose one? But we have only two positions to guess? And we have 6 tries? So we can guess one? And if wrong, we have more? But we want to maximize information? Or just solve? 

Since we have two positions, we can guess a word that uses two new letters? And if we get feedback, we can deduce? 

For example, if we guess ""CUTER"": 
- If the secret is ""CUTER"", we get all ✓? 
- If not, we get feedback on U and T? 

Similarly for ""CYBER"": we get feedback on Y and B? 

But we don't know which one? 

Alternatively, we can think about the most common letters? 

But we have used many consonants? 

We can also consider: in the first guess, we had E? And now we have E at position4? So the E in the first guess was at position5? Which was wrong? But we don't have information about other vowels? 

We have not used U, I, Y? Vowels? 

So ""CUTER"" uses U and T? 
""CYBER"" uses Y and B? 
""CITER"" uses I and T? 

T is common? 

But we have no information about T? 

Similarly, U, I, Y? 

We can choose ""CUTER"" because it's a common word? 

But note: we have to avoid eliminated letters? 

Another word: ""CUPER""? Not common? 

""SUPER"" doesn't start with C? 

I think ""CUTER"" is a good candidate? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

If we guess ""CUTER"" and the secret is not ""CUTER"", then we get:
- Position1: C ✓ 
- Position2: U: if U is in the word? If not, x? 
- Position3: T: if T is in the word? 
- Position4: E ✓ 
- Position5: R ✓ 

Then we can deduce the word? 

Similarly, if we guess ""CYBER"", same? 

But we have to choose one? 

Since we have two positions, and we are at guess4, we can try one? 

But to be efficient, we can choose a word that has letters that are common? 

T is more common than Y? So ""CUTER"" might be better? 

Also, U is a vowel? 

But we have no information about U? 

Alternatively, we can think: are there other words? 

What about ""CHEER""? But H? And E repeated? But we don't know? And H is not eliminated? But ""CHEER"" has E at position3 and position4? But position4 is E? And position3 is E? But we have E at position4? And if we have E at position3? But in guess2, we had E at position3? And it was marked as not in position3? So E cannot be at position3? Therefore, ""CHEER"" would have E at position3? Which is invalid? So we cannot have E at position3? So ""CHEER"" is not possible? Because it would require E at position3? But we know E is not at position3? 

Similarly, any word with E at position3 is invalid? 

So we are safe? 

Therefore, I choose ""CUTER"" as the fourth guess? 

But let's confirm: ""CUTER"" is C U T E R? Positions: 2:U, 3:T? 

Yes? 

So <guess>cuteR</guess>? But we write as ""CUTER""? 

But in the response, we write the word? 

But note: we have to return in the format: <guess>cuteR</guess>? No, the word is ""CUTER"". 

But in the feedback, we have to write the word? 

So I think ""CUTER"" is fine? 

But what if the secret is ""CYBER""? Then we get U and T wrong? 

But we can then guess ""CYBER"" next? 

But we have two guesses left? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses more common letters? But we have only two positions? 

Another idea: we can guess a word that has the same pattern but with different letters? But we don't have many options? 

But I think ""CUTER"" is a reasonable guess? 

So I'll go with that? 

But let's see: we have eliminated O and V? So available letters? 

Perhaps we can list all possible words? 

C ? ? E R 

With ? not in {A, N, L, K, O, V} and not C, E, R? 

Possible words: 
- Using B: ""CYBER"" (Y and B), ""CUBER"" (U and B) 
- Using D: ""CIDER"" (I and D) 
- Using F: ""CUFER""? Not word? 
- Using G: ""CAGER""? A excluded? ""CIGER""? Not? 
- Using H: ""CHER""? Not 5? ""CHOER""? O excluded? ""CHIER""? Not common? 
- Using I: ""CITER"" (I and T), ""CIDER"" (I and D) 
- Using M: ""CIMER""? Not? 
- Using P: ""CAPER""? A excluded? ""CIPER""? Not? 
- Using Q: ""CIQER""? Not? 
- Using S: ""CUSER""? Not? ""CASER""? A? 
- Using T: ""CUTER"" (U and T), ""CITER"" (I and T), ""CATER"" A excluded? 
- Using U: ""CUTER"", ""CUBER"" 
- Using W: ""CUWER""? Not? 
- Using X: ""CUXER""? Not? 
- Using Y: ""CYBER"" (Y and B), ""CYDER""? Not common? 
- Using Z: ""CUZER""? Not? 

So common words: 
- ""CUTER"" 
- ""CYBER"" 
- ""CIDER"" 
- ""CITER"" 
- ""CUBER"" (less common) 

Among these, ""CUTER"", ""CIDER"", ""CYBER"" are common? 

We can choose ""CUTER"" to test U and T? 

But if we guess ""CUTER"" and it's not correct, then we get feedback: 
- If U is in the word? 
- If T is in the word? 

Then we can deduce? 

For example, if U is in the word, then it must be at position2? Because the word is C _ _ E R? And if U is in the word, it must be at position2? Similarly, T at position3? 

But if U is not in the word, then position2 is not U? 

Similarly for T? 

Then we can try another word? 

But we have two guesses left? 

So it's acceptable? 

To cover more, we could choose a word with letters that appear in multiple possibilities? But it's hard? 

For example, ""CITER"" has I and T? But T is in ""CUTER"" and ""CITER""? 

But we don't know? 

I think ""CUTER"" is fine? 

So let's guess ""CUTER"". 

<guess>cuteR</guess>? No, the word is ""CUTER"". 

In the response, we write the word as ""CUTER"". 

But in the format: <guess>CUTER</guess> 

But let's write it properly. 

But note: in the feedback, we have to write the word? 

So I think: 

<guess>cuteR</guess> is not? We write the whole word? 

In the example, it was ""crane"", ""clerk"", etc? 

So we write ""CUTER"". 

But to be safe, we write it in uppercase? Or lowercase? The previous were lowercase? 

In the user message, it was ""crane"", ""clerk"", ""cover""? So lowercase? 

So we write ""cuteR""? No, the word is ""cuter""? 

""CUTER"" in lowercase is ""cuter""? 

Yes? 

So <guess>cuter</guess> 

But let's confirm: the word is ""cuter""? 

Yes. 

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  - C is in position 1 and correct.
  - R and E are in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, respectively.
  - A and N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2 (""clerk""):** C(✓) L(x) E(-) R(-) K(x)  
  - C is confirmed in position 1.
  - E is in the word but not in position 3.
  - R is in the word but not in position 4.
  - L and K are not in the word.

- **Guess 3 (""cover""):** C(✓) O(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)  
  - C, E, and R are correct and in positions 1, 4, and 5, respectively.
  - O and V are not in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word is of the form: `C _ _ E R` (positions: 1=C, 4=E, 5=R).
- Position 2 and 3 are unknown and must be filled with letters not yet eliminated.
- Eliminated letters (not in the word): A, N, L, K, O, V.
- The word must include only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (no duplicates, as no feedback indicated duplicates so far).
- Common words fitting this pattern include ""cuter"" (C U T E R), ""cyber"" (C Y B E R), ""cider"" (C I D E R), and ""citer"" (C I T E R).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test ""cuter"" to check if U and T are in positions 2 and 3. This is a common word that uses high-frequency letters (U is a vowel, T is a common consonant) and provides immediate feedback on two new letters.
- If ""cuter"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal whether U or T are in the word and/or in the correct positions, narrowing down the possibilities for the final guess.

Let\'s check: positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:E, 4:S, 5:T.\n\nBut note: Feedback for first guess said R is not in position 2. So if we guess ""CREST"", R is in position 2. But wait, in the secret word, R is not in position 2. So if we guess ""CREST"", we expect that R in position 2 would be marked as wrong (either \'-\' or \'x\')? Actually, since we know R is in the word but not position 2, if we put R in position 2 we\'ll get a \'-\' for R (meaning it\'s in the word but wrong position), but we already know that.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid putting R in position 2 since we know it\'s incorrect, so that we can test other positions.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess ""CREST"", we place R in position 2 (which we know is wrong) and E in position 3.\n\nIf the secret word has E in position 3, then we get a ✓ for E at position 3. Otherwise, we might get a \'-\' if E is in the word but not position 3, or \'x\' but we know E is in the word so it can\'t be \'x\'.\n\nActually, we know E is in the word, so if E is not in position 3, we get \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly, for R: we know R is in the word, and if we put it in position 2, we\'ll get \'-\' because we know it\'s not position 2.\n\nBut we can also try to place R in a different position.\n\nAnother idea: place R in position 3 or 4 or 5 to see if it gets ✓.\n\nFor example, let\'s try to make a word with C at 1, E at 2 (but is E allowed at position 2? We don\'t know yet), and R at 3,4 or 5.\n\nWe need to consider: the feedback told us E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 2,3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, R can be at position 3,4, or 5.\n\nSo, let\'s choose a word that places E in a new position, say position 2, and R in position 3,4, or 5.\n\nBut note: the secret word has 5 letters and we know C (position1), R, E, and two more letters.\n\nWe don\'t know the other two letters.\n\nWord: ""CEDAR"" - but we cannot use A (since A is not in the word), so avoid A.\n\nWord: ""CHERT"" - C, H, E, R, T -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:R, 5:T.\n\nThat might be a good one: it avoids position 2 for R (we put R at 4) and E at position 3. Also, we test H and T.\n\nAnother option: ""CREPT"" - C, R, E, P, T -> but R is at position 2? We know R is not at position 2, so putting R at position 2 would be a waste because we know it\'s wrong.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid putting R in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, in ""CREST"", R is at position 2, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid that.\n\nBetter to try a word that has R in a different position.\n\nOptions:\n- ""CERES"" - not a common word.\n- ""CODER"" - C, O, D, E, R -> but E is at position 4 and R at position 5. Also, O, D are new.\n\nBut note: position 1 is C, position 2 is O, position 3 is D, position 4 is E, position 5 is R.\n\nThis places E at position 4 and R at position 5.\n\nWe know E is not at position 5, but can be at 4. Similarly, R not at 2, but can be at 5.\n\nAlso, we don\'t use A or N.\n\nSo, ""CODER"" is a valid word? Yes, in programming, but also in English as a noun (one who codes). However, it might be accepted.\n\nBut perhaps we can choose a more common word.\n\nAnother word: ""CUTER"" - C, U, T, E, R -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R.\n\nThis also avoids position 2 for R and position 5 for E (E is at position 4, R at position 5).\n\nBut we don\'t know if E can be at position 4 or R at position 5.\n\nI think ""CUTER"" is acceptable.\n\nBut we also want to cover other common letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""CRUEL"": C, R, U, E, L -> but R is at position 2? No, if we structure it as 1:C, 2:R? Bad, because we know R is not at position 2.\n\nWe need to avoid position 2 for R.\n\nHow about ""CLERK"": C, L, E, R, K -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:R, 5:K.\n\nThis places E at position 3 and R at position 4.\n\nAnd L and K are new.\n\nThis seems good because:\n- Position 1: C (we know correct)\n- Position 2: L (new)\n- Position 3: E (if E is at position 3, we get ✓, if not we get \'-\' or ... but since E is in the word, it will be \'-\' if not at position 3)\n- Position 4: R (if R is at position 4, we get ✓, else if R is elsewhere, we get \'-\')\n- Position 5: K (new)\n\nAlso, no A, N.\n\nMoreover, ""CLERK"" is a common word.\n\nSo, I think ""CLERK"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother possibility: ""CRIMP"" - but R is at position 2? Avoid.\n\n""CREME"" - but E repeated? And R at position 2? Avoid.\n\n""COVER"" - C, O, V, E, R -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R -> same as before.\n\nBut ""CLERK"" is fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""CLERK"".\n\nSo, second guess: ""CLERK""\n\nBut note: we have to return it in the specified format.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is correct and in the right position (✓ at position 1), so the secret word starts with ""C"".\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).\n- A is not in the word (x), so it can be excluded.\n- N is not in the word (x), so it can be excluded.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).\n\nKey deductions:\n- The word starts with ""C"".\n- The word contains ""R"" and ""E"", which must be placed in positions other than the ones guessed: R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.\n- A and N are not in the word, so the second guess must avoid these letters.\n\nSince R and E could be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (with position 5 excluded for E), a strong second guess should:\n- Start with ""C"".\n- Include both ""R"" and ""E"" to test their possible positions.\n- Avoid A and N.\n- Use common letters to maximize information.\n\n""CLERK"" is a good candidate:\n- Position 1: C (fixed and correct).\n- Position 2: L (new letter to test).\n- Position 3: E (tests if E is in position 3).\n- Position 4: R (tests if R is in position 4).\n- Position 5: K (new letter to test).\n\nThis avoids known incorrect positions for R and E while covering new consonants like L and K.\n\n<guess>clerk</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: clerk -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) E(-) R(-) K(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n- C: ✓ (correct position)\n- R: - (in word, wrong position)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position)\n\nSecond guess: ""clerK"" (capital K for emphasis, but it\'s a letter)\n- C: ✓ (correct position)\n- L: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position)\n- R: - (in word, wrong position)\n- K: x (not in word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n\n1. The word starts with C (position 1 is fixed).\n2. The letters R and E are in the word, but neither was in their guessed positions:\n   - In ""crane"", R was guessed in position 2 and E in position 5; both were marked wrong position.\n   - In ""clerk"", E was guessed in position 3 and R in position 4; both were marked wrong position.\n\nSo we can deduce:\n- R is not in positions 2, 3, or 4? Wait, no: we only know it\'s not in pos 2 (from guess1) and not in pos 4 (from guess2), and it might be in pos 3 or 5? But guess2 had R in pos 4, so it\'s not pos 4. And guess1 had R in pos 2, not pos 2. But we haven\'t tested pos 5 for R? So R could be in position 3 or 5? However, we don\'t have information about position 3 for R because in guess2 we tested E in position 3, not R.\n\nSimilarly for E:\n- E is not in pos 5 (guess1) and not in pos 3 (guess2) because guess2 had E in pos3 and it was marked as \'-\', meaning it\'s not pos3. So E cannot be in positions 3 or 5? And we haven\'t tested position 2 for E? So possible positions for E are 2 or 4? And for R: we know not pos2 (guess1) and not pos4 (guess2), so R must be in pos3 (since pos1 is C) or pos5? But note: the secret word has exactly 5 positions.\n\nPotential positions for R: 3 or 5? (because 2 and 4 are excluded)\nBut: position 1 is C, so R cannot be there.\n\nAlso, we know E is in the word but not pos3 or pos5? So E must be in pos2 or pos4.\n\nNow, letters we have excluded from the word:\n- A (from guess1)\n- N (from guess1)\n- L (from guess2)\n- K (from guess2)\n\nSo the word contains:\n- C (fixed at pos1)\n- R\n- E\n- plus two other letters that are not A, N, L, or K.\n\nNow, we have two unknowns: the two letters and the positions of R and E.\n\nBut note: we cannot have R and E in positions that are already excluded.\n\nPossible configurations:\n\nLet the word be: C _ _ _ _\n\nPosition 2: Either E or one of the other letters. But E can be pos2? We haven\'t tested pos2 for E? Actually, we have not guessed E in pos2 yet.\n\nSimilarly, position 3: we have not tested for R? But we tested for E in pos3 and it was wrong. But R could be in pos3? Yes.\n\nPosition 4: we tested R in pos4 and it was wrong, so R not at pos4.\n\nPosition 5: we tested E in pos5 and it was wrong? So E cannot be pos5.\n\nTherefore:\n- R must be in position 3 or 5? Because pos2 and pos4 are invalid for R.\n- E must be in position 2 or 4? Because pos3 and pos5 are invalid for E.\n\nBut note: if R is in pos3, E could be pos2 or pos4. Similarly, if R is in pos5, E could be pos2 or pos4.\n\nHowever, the position constraints must be considered with the rest of the word.\n\nWe also need to choose a third guess that uses the known information and gives us more clues.\n\nWe must avoid letters L, K, A, N.\n\nWe must include R and E? No, we already know they are in the word, so our guess must include them? Not necessarily, but we have only 6 guesses and we need to solve, so guessing a word without R or E would be bad because we won\'t get information about the positions? Or we might not include them to test other letters? But since we have limited guesses, it\'s better to include the known letters to confirm their positions? However, we know R and E are in the word, so we can try to place them in the possible positions that remain.\n\nPossible positions for E: 2 or 4.\nPossible positions for R: 3 or 5.\n\nSo that gives us four cases:\n\nCase 1: E at 2, R at 3 -> word: C E R ? ?\nCase 2: E at 2, R at 5 -> word: C E ? ? R\nCase 3: E at 4, R at 3 -> word: C ? R E ?\nCase 4: E at 4, R at 5 -> word: C ? ? E R\n\nBut each of these has two more letters to be determined? We have positions to fill.\n\nFor each case, we need a guess that fits one of these patterns? Or we can make a guess that tests one of these possibilities.\n\nHowever, our guess must be a valid English word.\n\nWe also have to use letters that have not been eliminated: so letters excluding A, N, L, K.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t used many letters? We have used C, R, A, N, E, L, K? And the word must have two more letters? Unknown.\n\nIn guess1: ""crane"" letters: C,R,A,N,E\nIn guess2: ""clerk"": C,L,E,R,K\n\nSo covered letters: C, R, A, N, E, L, K\n\nEliminated letters: A, N, L, K\n\nSo remaining letters: all English vowels and consonants except A,N,L,K.\n\nWe should focus on common remaining letters: maybe vowels O, U? Or consonants B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But no A or N or L or K? So L and K are out? But in first guess E was present? And R.\n\nActually E and R are in, and C is fixed.\n\nSo for the word we need: starting with C, contains E and R (and E and R positions constrained), and two other letters from the remaining set of letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut specifically: avoid A, N, L, K.\n\nNow, we can design a guess that fits one of the cases? Or tests multiple possibilities.\n\nBut note: if we guess a word with E in position 2, we can see if E is indeed in pos2? Similarly for R.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that places E in one of its possible positions and R in one of its, and also uses new letters to test.\n\nBut we have only one more guess to get information?\n\nWe need to cover more letters? Or constrain possibilities.\n\nWhat are common words to guess?\n\nFirst, let\'s list possible positions:\n\nIf we assume case 1: word like C E R _ _\nWhat can fit? E.g., ""CERTS"" or ""CERTY""? Not valid? ""CERES"" not common? ""CERV""? Not 5.\n\nBut ""CERTY"" is not a word? ""CERTS"" no? ""CERT"" is 4; need 5 letters.\n\nActually, valid English words: ""CERTy"" -> ""CERTY"" is not standard? But ""CERTY"" no? Let me think: ""CERTS"" is not a common word? Better: ""CERED""? Not valid.\n\nInstead, let\'s consider case 3 or case 4? What words exist?\n\nCase 3: word C _ R E _\nPossible: ""CURED"" (C _ R E _) -> positions:2:U, 5:D? But D is allowed? No A,N,L,K.\nBut ""CURED"" would be: position1:C, position2:U, position3:R, position4:E, position5:D.\nIn this case: U, R, E, D? But R is at position3? We have? U and E,D? But E at position4.\n\nNow check against known: \nIf secret word were ""CURED"":\n- For guess1 ""crane"": position1: C? Yes and ✓? No: ""crane"" has C at1: ✓. R at2: secret has R at3? So R at2 not same? So R: in word, wrong position? That matches -. A at3: secret has U? So not A? A x matches? N at4: secret has E? So not N x? E at5: secret has D? So E? Secret has E at4? So E at5 is not correct? And E is in word? So E: -? Matches.\n\nGuess2: ""clerk"": C ✓ L: secret has U? Not L? L x? E: at position3? Secret has E at4? So E in word wrong position? Hence -? R at position4? Secret has R at3? So R at4 is wrong? Hence -? K at5: secret has D? So K x? Matches the feedback? So ""CURED"" is entirely possible? \n\nBut note: in guess2 we guessed ""clerk"" and got E at position3: -, but secret has E at position4? So indeed, E was guessed in pos3 (wrong) and R in pos4 (wrong)? And R is at pos3? So in guess2, we didn\'t have R at position3? We had R at position4? So position3 was E? And result was E: -? Because E is not at pos3? Correct.\n\nSimilarly, case 1: C E R _ _ \nWhat word? ""CERTs""? No? ""CERVS""? No? ""CERSE""? Not common? ""CERES"" is a name? Not common? ""CERTY"" not a word?\n\nAnother possibility: ""CERO""? Not 5 letters.\n\nCase 2: C E _ _ R\nExamples: ""CENTER""? Not because it has T,E,N? N is excluded? But N is not in? We have to avoid N? So ""CETER""? No? ""CEDER""? E? But E at position2, R at position5? ""CEDER"": C E D E R? But E at position2 and position4? Secret word could have two E\'s? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us duplicates? We don\'t know? Actually, we aren\'t told about duplicate letters? In feedback, if a letter appears in the secret multiple times? But let me check: in guess2 ""clerk"": we used E once? And got E:-, meaning E is not in position3? But if secret had two E\'s, then if E in position3 absent? But E might appear elsewhere? But generally, no indication? So possibility.\n\nBut ""CEDER"" is not common? ""CEDAR"" excluded because A? A is out? So no.\n\n""CEILR""? Not English? Better: ""CELLR""? No? Not good.\n\nCase 4: C _ _ E R\nExamples: ""CATER"" -> C A T E R? But A is excluded? Cannot use A? ""COMER""? C O M E R? That could be? Avoid A,N,L,K? Yes? Also ""COVER"", ""COWER"", etc.\n\nBut we have case 3: C _ R E _ -> like ""CURED"", ""CRIED"", etc.\n\nAnd our guess2 eliminated L and K? So we can form words with other letters.\n\nBut to get information faster, we should guess a word that will test the positions for E and R and also use new common letters? Also, we want to use letters that haven\'t been used? To see if they appear.\n\nFor example, we can guess a word that places E at position 2 and R at position 5? Or position3? Etc? But because of constraints?\n\nBest: try to guess a word that fits Case 3 or Case 4? But we don\'t know which? So choose a guess that will distinguish? Or cover.\n\nProposal: guess a word that has E at position 2 (to test if E is at position 2) and R at one of its possible positions? Also? And new letters.\n\nFor example, let\'s try ""CATER"": but A excluded? Not possible? Avoid A.\n\nSo ""COMER""? But it might not be common? ""CODER""? D, O? But in guess2 we didn\'t have O or D? So ""CODER"": C O D E R -> E at position4? Not position2? Wait, position2 is O? Position4 is E.\n\nIf E is in position2? Then we need a word like ""C E _ _ _"".\n\nFor example, ""CEBID""? Not common? ""CEDAR"" excluded? ""CEILI""? No? ""CELLO"": C E L L O? But we know L is not in the word! Because in guess2, L was at position2? Eliminated with x? So if L is eliminated, we cannot use L? So ""CELLO"" is invalid? Cannot have L. Similarly, K is eliminated.\n\nSo we must avoid L.\n\nPossible word with E in position2: ""CEASE""? But A and E? A is out? ""CEASE"" has A? No? If we avoid A? ""CEILI""? No? ""CENSE""? But N is out? ""CEORL""? Not English? This is hard.\n\nAlternative: ""CEMENT"": too long? No, 5 letters? ""CEMENT"" is 6? Not. How about ""CERES""? Not common.\n\nPerhaps it\'s easier to test the other position? Place E at position4 and R at position5? Since R cannot be position3? Or test E at position4.\n\nSimilarly, we can choose a word that fits Case 4: C _ _ E R? Like ""COWER"", ""COVER"", ""COMER"".\n\nOr Case 3: C _ R E D? Like ""CURED"", ""CRIED"", ""CROME"" not? ""CRUEL""? But L is out? So L not allowed? ""CRUEL"" has L? Avoid.\n\nWords for Case 3: C _ R E _ \nValid English words without L, K, A, N: ""CREDO""? ""CREDO"" is C R E D O -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:E, 4:D, 5:O? But wait, R at position2? We know R cannot be in position2! From guess1? Guess1: R in pos2 was marked wrong? So secret R not position2? Therefore in ""CREDO"", R is at position2? Not allowed? So words for Case 3 must have R at position3? As in C ? R E ?\n\nSo: position 2 must be one letter, R at position3, E at position4? Then position5? \n\nPossible: ""C U R E D"" -> ""CURED"" (as I thought earlier)\nOr ""C I R E D""? ""CIRED"" not a word?\nOr ""C A R E D""? A excluded? Cannot use A.\nOr ""C O R E D"" -> ""CORED""\nOr ""C T R E D""? Not common.\nOr ""C H R E W""? ""CHREW"" not word.\nBest: ""CORED"" or ""CURED""? Both valid?\n\nSimilarly for Case 4: C ? ? E R -> ""COPER"", ""COVER"", ""COWER"", ""CAVER"" A? Excluded? Or ""CITER""?\n\nBack to our guess: we need to make a third guess that tests some of these.\n\nA good approach: we can guess ""CORED"": ""CORED"" means C O R E D? But positions: \n1:C (fixed), 2:O, 3:R, 4:E, 5:D\n\nCheck constraints:\nFor E: if the secret has E in position4, then we get it? And for R in position3? Similarly? Also, we can get new information? \n\nBut wait, we know E cannot be in position3? From guess2? Guess2 ""clerk"" had E at position3, marked -, so E not position3? Similarly, E not position5? So E must be pos2 or pos4? In ""CORED"", E is at position4.\n\nAnd R: we know not position2? And not position4? So R in position3? That fits? Because in ""CORED"", R is at position3? \n\nSo if secret has R at position3? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if R is not at position3, then we get \'-\'. But note, R must be in position3 or position5? So if R not at3, it must be at5? \n\nSimilarly, for E: if E at position4? Then ✓? Else, if E at position2, then we get \'-\'? \n\nBut secret word: if it has E at position4 and R at position3? Then ""CORED"" is a candidate? \n\nSimilarly, ""CURED"" is another? Both have R at position3.\n\nBut what if R is at position5? For example, secret word ""C O V E R"" -> ""COVER"", then R is at position5? \n\nWhen we guess ""CORED"": \nIf secret is ""COVER"", then we get:\nPosition1: C ✓\nPosition2: O? Secret position2: V? Not O? But O might be absent? So:\n- Position1: C ✓ \n- Position2: O: ? secret has O? ""COVER"" does not have O? So O would be marked x? \n- Position3: R: secret has R at position5? So R is in word? But position3: secret has V? Not R? So R: -\n- Position4: E: secret position4: E? So ✓ \n- Position5: D? Secret position5: R? Not D? So D: x\n\nAnd if secret is ""CURED"": \n- Position1: C ✓ \n- Position2: O? Secret position2: U? Not O? So O: ?\n- Position3: R: secret position3: R? So ✓ \n- Position4: E: secret position4: E? ✓ \n- Position5: D: secret position5: D? ✓ \n\nOnly if both R and E positions match? \n\nBut if secret is ""COVER"" (with R at5), then R at3 in ""CORED"" would get \'-\'.\n\nWe have also other possibilities.\n\nTo get more letters, we can guess ""CORED"".\n\nAnother candidate: ""COWER"" or ""COVER""? But ""COVER"" does not have R at position3? \n\nPerhaps we can also guess ""CUTER"": C U T E R? But E at position4? R at position5? So positions: \n1:C, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R\n\nAnd we haven\'t used U, T? \n\nIn guess2 we had ""clerk"", E was at3? Not E at4.\n\nPotential: \nIf secret E at position4? Then we get ✓? \nIf secret R at position5? Then we get ✓?\n\nBut what if secret E at position2? Then E at position4 in guess would get \'-\', etc.\n\nAlso, T and U are new letters.\n\nBut ""CUTER"" might not be common? But accepted as a word.\n\nLet\'s choose: ""CURED"" is a possible word? We can guess it? But it might be the answer? So if we guess and it\'s wrong, we get feed? \n\nBetter to guess a word with new letters? \n\n""SCARE""? Starts with S? Cannot? Position1 must be C? Fixed? No? Start must be C? Because we have C at1 fixed? So all guesses must start with C? Because position1 is C? Yes.\n\nSo every guess must start with C? Because it will be ✓ if correct? And we know it is? \n\nTherefore, guess starts with C? Must: C _ _ _ _\n\nNow, with the constraints, let me design a guess.\n\nConsider placing E at position4? To see if E is at that position? Similarly, place R at position? We can\'t place R at position5 because we haven\'t tested? Or place R at position3? Which is one option.\n\nIf we place R at position5? Then we get: if secret R at position5, ✓, else - if R at position3? But R at position3 or5? If not at5, must be at3? So we can get info? \n\nSimilarly, place E at position2? So guess: C E ? ? R? But what letters? With avoid L,K,A,N? And the ? can be any letters.\n\nBut to have a valid word? Like ""C E D A R"" has A? Excluded? ""C E I L R""? L excluded? ""C E M E R""? Could be ""CEMER""? Not common? ""CEORL""? Not.\n\nPerhaps ""C E T Y R""? Not word? Not easy? \n\nSo maybe placing E at position4 is feasible? \n\nGuess: ""COVER"" -> C O V E R? \nPositions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R\n\nNow, this:\n- Tests E at position4? If E is at pos4, we get ✓? Else if E is at pos2, then E at4 will be -\n- Tests R at position5? If R at5, ✓? Else if R at3, then R at5 will be -? Because R is still in the word.\n\nAlso, introduces O, V as new letters? If any of them are in the word? We can get feedback.\n\nSo I think ""COVER"" is a good guess? \n\nAnother possibility: ""CUTER""? C U T E R? Same structure? E at4? R at5? \n\n""COVER"" is more common? \n\nAlso, ""COMER"" is less common? \n\nBut we must check if it fits: in ""COVER"", E at position4 and R at position5? Which are possible? \n\nIf the secret word has E at position4 and R at position5? Then we get all? ✓? \n\nIf not, we get partial.\n\nAlso, the word might be? \n\nSince we have used O and V? Or not? \n\nSo for guess3, I choose ""COVER"".\n\nLet\'s see what happens if secret has E at position2? For example, secret word ""CE R something?""? But we cannot find words? \n\nBut if secret is ""C E R T S""? But not a word? Or ""C E R G E""? Not 5 letters? So E at position2? R at position3? Then position4 and 5 need letters? E.g., ""CERNE""? Not? ""CERED""? Not? ""CEBID""? Not common? \n\nSimilarly, E at position2 and R at position5: ""CELER""? L excluded? ""CEDER""? Not A? ""CETYL""? Not common? I think E at position2 might be less common? Plus, we haven\'t tested position2 with E? So by placing E in position4, we can test position4? \n\nSimilarly, R in position5.\n\nSo ""COVER"" is suitable.\n\nTherefore, our third guess will be ""COVER"".\n\n<guess>cover</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** C(✓), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n  - This indicates that ""C"" is correct and in position 1.\n  - ""R"" and ""E"" are in the word but not in positions 2 and 5, respectively.\n  - ""A"" and ""N"" are not in the word and can be excluded.\n\n- **Guess 2 (""clerk""):** C(✓), L(x), E(-), R(-), K(x)\n  - This confirms ""C"" is fixed at position 1.\n  - ""E"" is in the word but not in position 3 (since E at position 3 was marked wrong).\n  - ""R"" is in the word but not in position 4 (since R at position 4 was marked wrong).\n  - ""L"" and ""K"" are not in the word and can be excluded.\n\nKey deductions:\n- Position 1: Must be ""C"".\n- Possible positions for ""E"": Positions 2 or 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).\n- Possible positions for ""R"": Positions 3 or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).\n- Eliminated letters: A, N, L, K. Any new guess must avoid these.\n- The word must include ""R"" and ""E"", and two unknown letters from the remaining English alphabet (excluding A, N, L, K).\n\nFor the third guess, choose a word that:\n- Starts with ""C"".\n- Places ""E"" in position 4 (to test for E at position 4) and ""R"" in position 5 (to test for R at position 5).\n- Introduces new common letters to gather more information.\n- Avoids eliminated letters (A, N, L, K).\n\n""COVER"" fits these requirements:\n- C (position 1): Known correct.\n- O (position 2): New letter (untested vowel).\n- V (position 3): New letter (common consonant).\n- E (position 4): Tests if E is in position 4.\n- R (position 5): Tests if R is in position 5.\n\nThis guess will provide feedback to narrow down the positions of E and R and reveal if O or V are in the word.\n\n<guess>cover</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: clerk -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) E(-) R(-) K(x)\nGuess 3: cover -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the third guess ""cover"":\n- C: ✓ (correct position, as expected)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n- V: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position at 4)\n- R: ✓ (correct position at 5)\n\nThis tells us:\n- The secret word has E in position 4 and R in position 5.\n- O and V are not in the word.\n\nSo the secret word is: C _ _ E R\n\nWe know:\n- Position 1: C (fixed)\n- Position 4: E (fixed)\n- Position 5: R (fixed)\n- Position 2 and 3 are unknown, but we know:\n  - The letters in position 2 and 3 must be from the remaining alphabet excluding A, N, L, K, O, V (since these are eliminated).\n  - Also, the word must be a valid English word.\n\nFrom previous feedback, we have eliminated: A, N, L, K, O, V.\n\nWe also know that the word contains exactly these five letters: C, ?, ?, E, R.\n\nWe need to find the two missing letters for positions 2 and 3.\n\nPossible letters: all letters except A, N, L, K, O, V, and also excluding C, E, R (since they are already placed, but note that the two missing letters could be duplicates?

Then we have two R\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback for guess1 and guess2, we didn\'t have duplicates? But let\'s see: if there were duplicates, the feedback might show multiple marks? But in this case, we haven\'t seen that? So perhaps no duplicates? But we can\'t rule out? However, to be efficient, we can avoid duplicates for now? But ""CURER"" has two R\'s? And we have R at position5? So if we guess ""CURER"", we might get feedback on R? But we already know R is at position5? So if there is another R? But we don\'t know? But in the first guess, we had R in position2? And it was marked as present but wrong position? But that doesn\'t tell us if there is only one R? Similarly, in guess2, R in position4? Marked as present but wrong position? And now we have R at position5? So if the secret word has only one R, then in guess3 we got R at position5? Correct? So if we guess a word with two R\'s? It might be invalid? Or it might be that the secret has two R\'s? But we have no evidence? So to be safe, we should avoid assuming duplicates? But we can consider both? However, for the next guess, we can try a word without duplicates? \n\nBut let\'s list possible words without duplicates? \n\nCommon words: \n- ""CUTER"": C U T E R -> positions: 2:U, 3:T\n- ""CITER"": C I T E R -> 2:I, 3:T\n- ""CYBER"": C Y B E R -> 2:Y, 3:B\n- ""CEDER"": but E at position4? And D? But ""CEDER"" is not common? And we have E at position4? But ""CEDER"" has two E\'s? If we consider? But E is at position4? And position2 is E? Then it would be duplicate? But we don\'t know? But ""CEDER"" is not a standard word? ""Cedar"" is with A? Excluded.\n- ""COMER"": O excluded? Cannot.\n- ""COWER"": O excluded? Cannot.\n- ""CAKER""? Not a word? And K excluded? \n- ""CAGER""? A excluded? \n- ""CUBER"": C U B E R -> 2:U, 3:B? Valid? ""Cuber"" (one who cubes) is a word? Less common? \n- ""CUTER"" is more common? \n\nAlso, ""CYBER"" is common? \n\nBut we have to avoid O and V? So ""CYBER"" is possible? \n\nAnother: ""CATER"" excluded? \n\n""CAVER"" excluded? \n\n""COVER"" we already guessed? \n\nSo possible: ""CUTER"", ""CYBER"", ""CITER"", ""CUBER"", etc.\n\nNow, we have to choose one? But we have only two positions to guess? And we have 6 tries? So we can guess one? And if wrong, we have more? But we want to maximize information? Or just solve? \n\nSince we have two positions, we can guess a word that uses two new letters? And if we get feedback, we can deduce? \n\nFor example, if we guess ""CUTER"": \n- If the secret is ""CUTER"", we get all ✓? \n- If not, we get feedback on U and T? \n\nSimilarly for ""CYBER"": we get feedback on Y and B? \n\nBut we don\'t know which one? \n\nAlternatively, we can think about the most common letters? \n\nBut we have used many consonants? \n\nWe can also consider: in the first guess, we had E? And now we have E at position4? So the E in the first guess was at position5? Which was wrong? But we don\'t have information about other vowels? \n\nWe have not used U, I, Y? Vowels? \n\nSo ""CUTER"" uses U and T? \n""CYBER"" uses Y and B? \n""CITER"" uses I and T? \n\nT is common? \n\nBut we have no information about T? \n\nSimilarly, U, I, Y? \n\nWe can choose ""CUTER"" because it\'s a common word? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid eliminated letters? \n\nAnother word: ""CUPER""? Not common? \n\n""SUPER"" doesn\'t start with C? \n\nI think ""CUTER"" is a good candidate? \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get? \n\nIf we guess ""CUTER"" and the secret is not ""CUTER"", then we get:\n- Position1: C ✓ \n- Position2: U: if U is in the word? If not, x? \n- Position3: T: if T is in the word? \n- Position4: E ✓ \n- Position5: R ✓ \n\nThen we can deduce the word? \n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""CYBER"", same? \n\nBut we have to choose one? \n\nSince we have two positions, and we are at guess4, we can try one? \n\nBut to be efficient, we can choose a word that has letters that are common? \n\nT is more common than Y? So ""CUTER"" might be better? \n\nAlso, U is a vowel? \n\nBut we have no information about U? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: are there other words? \n\nWhat about ""CHEER""? But H? And E repeated? But we don\'t know? And H is not eliminated? But ""CHEER"" has E at position3 and position4? But position4 is E? And position3 is E? But we have E at position4? And if we have E at position3? But in guess2, we had E at position3? And it was marked as not in position3? So E cannot be at position3? Therefore, ""CHEER"" would have E at position3? Which is invalid? So we cannot have E at position3? So ""CHEER"" is not possible? Because it would require E at position3? But we know E is not at position3? \n\nSimilarly, any word with E at position3 is invalid? \n\nSo we are safe? \n\nTherefore, I choose ""CUTER"" as the fourth guess? \n\nBut let\'s confirm: ""CUTER"" is C U T E R? Positions: 2:U, 3:T? \n\nYes? \n\nSo <guess>cuteR</guess>? But we write as ""CUTER""? \n\nBut in the response, we write the word? \n\nBut note: we have to return in the format: <guess>cuteR</guess>? No, the word is ""CUTER"". \n\nBut in the feedback, we have to write the word? \n\nSo I think ""CUTER"" is fine? \n\nBut what if the secret is ""CYBER""? Then we get U and T wrong? \n\nBut we can then guess ""CYBER"" next? \n\nBut we have two guesses left? \n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that uses more common letters? But we have only two positions? \n\nAnother idea: we can guess a word that has the same pattern but with different letters? But we don\'t have many options? \n\nBut I think ""CUTER"" is a reasonable guess? \n\nSo I\'ll go with that? \n\nBut let\'s see: we have eliminated O and V? So available letters? \n\nPerhaps we can list all possible words? \n\nC ? ? E R \n\nWith ? not in {A, N, L, K, O, V} and not C, E, R? \n\nPossible words: \n- Using B: ""CYBER"" (Y and B), ""CUBER"" (U and B) \n- Using D: ""CIDER"" (I and D) \n- Using F: ""CUFER""? Not word? \n- Using G: ""CAGER""? A excluded? ""CIGER""? Not? \n- Using H: ""CHER""? Not 5? ""CHOER""? O excluded? ""CHIER""? Not common? \n- Using I: ""CITER"" (I and T), ""CIDER"" (I and D) \n- Using M: ""CIMER""? Not? \n- Using P: ""CAPER""? A excluded? ""CIPER""? Not? \n- Using Q: ""CIQER""? Not? \n- Using S: ""CUSER""? Not? ""CASER""? A? \n- Using T: ""CUTER"" (U and T), ""CITER"" (I and T), ""CATER"" A excluded? \n- Using U: ""CUTER"", ""CUBER"" \n- Using W: ""CUWER""? Not? \n- Using X: ""CUXER""? Not? \n- Using Y: ""CYBER"" (Y and B), ""CYDER""? Not common? \n- Using Z: ""CUZER""? Not? \n\nSo common words: \n- ""CUTER"" \n- ""CYBER"" \n- ""CIDER"" \n- ""CITER"" \n- ""CUBER"" (less common) \n\nAmong these, ""CUTER"", ""CIDER"", ""CYBER"" are common? \n\nWe can choose ""CUTER"" to test U and T? \n\nBut if we guess ""CUTER"" and it\'s not correct, then we get feedback: \n- If U is in the word? \n- If T is in the word? \n\nThen we can deduce? \n\nFor example, if U is in the word, then it must be at position2? Because the word is C _ _ E R? And if U is in the word, it must be at position2? Similarly, T at position3? \n\nBut if U is not in the word, then position2 is not U? \n\nSimilarly for T? \n\nThen we can try another word? \n\nBut we have two guesses left? \n\nSo it\'s acceptable? \n\nTo cover more, we could choose a word with letters that appear in multiple possibilities? But it\'s hard? \n\nFor example, ""CITER"" has I and T? But T is in ""CUTER"" and ""CITER""? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nI think ""CUTER"" is fine? \n\nSo let\'s guess ""CUTER"". \n\n<guess>cuteR</guess>? No, the word is ""CUTER"". \n\nIn the response, we write the word as ""CUTER"". \n\nBut in the format: <guess>CUTER</guess> \n\nBut let\'s write it properly. \n\nBut note: in the feedback, we have to write the word? \n\nSo I think: \n\n<guess>cuteR</guess> is not? We write the whole word? \n\nIn the example, it was ""crane"", ""clerk"", etc? \n\nSo we write ""CUTER"". \n\nBut to be safe, we write it in uppercase? Or lowercase? The previous were lowercase? \n\nIn the user message, it was ""crane"", ""clerk"", ""cover""? So lowercase? \n\nSo we write ""cuteR""? No, the word is ""cuter""? \n\n""CUTER"" in lowercase is ""cuter""? \n\nYes? \n\nSo <guess>cuter</guess> \n\nBut let\'s confirm: the word is ""cuter""? \n\nYes. \n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  \n  - C is in position 1 and correct.\n  - R and E are in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, respectively.\n  - A and N are not in the word.\n\n- **Guess 2 (""clerk""):** C(✓) L(x) E(-) R(-) K(x)  \n  - C is confirmed in position 1.\n  - E is in the word but not in position 3.\n  - R is in the word but not in position 4.\n  - L and K are not in the word.\n\n- **Guess 3 (""cover""):** C(✓) O(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)  \n  - C, E, and R are correct and in positions 1, 4, and 5, respectively.\n  - O and V are not in the word.\n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word is of the form: `C _ _ E R` (positions: 1=C, 4=E, 5=R).\n- Position 2 and 3 are unknown and must be filled with letters not yet eliminated.\n- Eliminated letters (not in the word): A, N, L, K, O, V.\n- The word must include only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (no duplicates, as no feedback indicated duplicates so far).\n- Common words fitting this pattern include ""cuter"" (C U T E R), ""cyber"" (C Y B E R), ""cider"" (C I D E R), and ""citer"" (C I T E R).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- Test ""cuter"" to check if U and T are in positions 2 and 3. This is a common word that uses high-frequency letters (U is a vowel, T is a common consonant) and provides immediate feedback on two new letters.\n- If ""cuter"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal whether U or T are in the word and/or in the correct positions, narrowing down the possibilities for the final guess.\n\n<guess>cuteR</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: clerk -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) E(-) R(-) K(x)\nGuess 3: cover -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: cuteR -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(x) T(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from Guess 4 (""cuteR""): C(✓), U(x), T(x), E(✓), R(✓)

Interpretation:
- C, E, R in positions 1,4,5 are correct (as before).
- U is not in the word at all (x).
- T is not in the word at all (x).

Therefore:
- The secret word is C ? ? E R, with positions 2 and 3 being two letters that are not U, T, and not any previously eliminated letters (A, N, L, K, O, V).

Eliminated letters: A, N, L, K, O, V, U, T.

Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, Q, S, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words of the form C _ _ E R:
- Common options include:
  - ""CIDER"": C I D E R → uses I and D.
  - ""CYBER"": uses Y and B → but ""CYBER"" is C Y B E R? Positions 2:Y, 3:B? Yes.
  - ""CIFER"" → not a common English word.
  - ""CIMER"" → not common.
  - ""CIPER"" → not common (possible misspelling of ""cipher""?)
  - ""CIZER"" → not common.
  - More: ""CITER"" (C I T E R) but T is eliminated? No, T is now eliminated? Guess 4 showed T(x), so T not in word → therefore ""CITER"" is invalid (contains T). Similarly, ""CUBER"" contains U? Invalid.

So possible words:
- ""CIDER"": C I D E R → positions: 2=I, 3=D
- ""CYBER"": C Y B E R → positions: 2=Y, 3=B
- ""CIGER"" → not standard.
- ""CIPER"" → not common, but ""CIPER"" might be a variant? Unlikely.
- ""CIBER"" → common misspelling of ""cyber"", but not standard.
- ""CIPHER"" is 6 letters? Not 5.

Other less common words:
- ""CIWER"" → not a word.
- ""CIDERY"" is 6? Not.

What about ""CIDES"" but wrong structure? We have E at 4 and R at 5, so must be ? ? E R.

Another: ""CHER"": too short? Not 5.

So mostly left are ""CIDER"" and ""CYBER"".

We can make a guess between these two? Since we have two possibilities and one guess left? We have 6 tries total, and we've used 4? So two left? But we are on guess 5.

We are on the fifth guess? And we have two possibilities? We can choose one? If wrong, we can use the sixth? 

But to be safe, we can choose the more common word? ""CIDER"" is a very common word? ""CYBER"" is also common? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses a letter that covers multiple possibilities? But we have only two words? 

So I'll choose ""CIDER"" because it uses I and D? Both common? 

But if we guess ""CIDER"" and it's wrong, then we know it's ""CYBER""? 

Similarly, if we guess ""CYBER"", and it's wrong, then ""CIDER""? 

But which one? 

Let's see: we could get feedback? 

I think ""CIDER"" is a good guess? 

But note: in the remaining letters, we have not used I and D? 

So guess ""CIDER"". 

If the feedback shows: 
- C ✓, I ... D ... E ✓, R ✓? Then we can see? 

So I'll go with ""CIDER"". 

But let me check if there are other words? What about ""CYDER""? Alternative spelling? Not common? 

Also, ""CIGAR""? But A excluded? And structure? C I G A R? Positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:G, 4:A, 5:R → no E? But our word must have E at position 4? So not.

Therefore, likely candidates: ""CIDER"" and ""CYBER"". 

I choose ""CIDER"" for the fifth guess.

### Feedback from Guess 4 (""cuteR""):
- C(✓) : Correct position (as expected).
- U(x) : U is not in the word at all.
- T(x) : T is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) : Correct position (confirms E at position 4).
- R(✓) : Correct position (confirms R at position 5).

### Deductions:
- **Secret word structure**: C _ _ E R (positions 1=C, 4=E, 5=R).
- **Position 2 and 3** must be filled with letters not yet eliminated.
- **Newly eliminated letters** (not in the word): U and T.
- **All eliminated letters**: A, N, L, K, O, V, U, T (from previous feedback).
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, Q, S, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Possible words**: Words fitting `C ? ? E R` include ""CIDER"" (C I D E R) or ""CYBER"" (C Y B E R). Given common English words, ""CIDER"" is a strong candidate as it uses high-frequency letters (I, D) not tested before.

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- Guess ""CIDER"" to test I in position 2 and D in position 3.  
- If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on I and D will reveal their status (e.g., present/missing), narrowing down to ""CYBER"" or other options for the final guess.
