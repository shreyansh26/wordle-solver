We are given feedback on the first guess ""ROAST"":
R(-): R is in the word but not in the correct position.
O(x): O is not in the word.
A(✓): A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, if we count positions 1 to 5).
S(x): S is not in the word.
T(x): T is not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The letter A is present and in the 3rd position (since it was correct in ""ROAST"", which is R-O-A-S-T, so A is at position 3).
- R is in the word, but not at position 1 (since it was the first letter and marked as - meaning wrong position).
- O, S, T are not in the word at all.

The secret word has the letter A at position 3: _ _ A _ _

Also, R is present somewhere else in the word, but not at position 1.

Since we have eliminated O, S, T, and O and S were vowels, we might look for other vowels or common consonants.

We have 5 positions to fill. We need to choose a word that:
- Contains R (but not at position 1) and A at position 3.
- Does not contain O, S, T.

Additionally, we can consider that the word must be a common 5-letter English word.

Possible positions for R:
It cannot be at position 1, and since position 3 is A, R can only be at positions 2, 4, or 5.

But note: R might also be repeated? But the feedback for R was given as one occurrence (since we only had one R in ""ROAST""), so the word might have one or more R's? However, the feedback does not specify how many, so we should consider that there is at least one R.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: _ _ A _ _ and include R, but not at the start.

Common letters to try: We might try another vowel. We know O is out, so vowels left: A (we already have one A), E, I, U, and sometimes Y. But A is present and at position 3, and we don't know if there are more As? The feedback doesn't indicate another A because our guess had one A and it was correct, so if there were another A, it would have shown in the feedback? Actually, the feedback per letter is independent. Since we had only one A and it was correct, if there were another A in the word we wouldn't know because we didn't guess a second A. So we have to consider the possibility of multiple As? It's safer to start with the assumption of one A for now.

To maximize information, we should try to include new letters that haven't been tried. We have eliminated O, S, T. We have R and A confirmed.

Let me list the letters we have tried: R, O, A, S, T. So unused letters: most of the alphabet.

We want to test vowels because vowels are common. The vowels we haven't tried: E, I, U (and Y). So we should include one or two of these.

Also, avoid S, O, T.

Possible guess:

We know position 3 is A.

Position 1: cannot be R (because feedback R(-) for position 1). Also, not any letter that is excluded. So any letter except O, S, T and R? But note: position 1 could be another letter that is R? But we have R in the word but not at 1, so position 1 must be a new letter.

We can try a word with E at the beginning or in other positions.

Consider the word ""CRAVE"" but then C is new, R is included? But in ""CRAVE"": positions: C, R, A, V, E. But we know position 3 is A, and if we put A at 3 then R is at position 2? That might be okay.

However, we need to form a word that has A at position 3 and R somewhere else.

But note: our guess must be a word.

Also, in the feedback we were told that R is present but not at position 1 in the secret word. In our new guess, we can have R at any position except we hope it doesn't interfere with the feedback we get.

One idea: try a word with E and I to test those vowels.

We try to build a word:

Position 1: pick a new consonant, say B or C or D, etc.
Position 2: pick a vowel, say E or I or U, so that we can test.
Position 3: A (fixed)
Position 4: maybe R? Or another new letter? Remember R cannot be at position 1 but can be elsewhere.

But R might be at position 4? Or position 5? Or position 2? But if we put R at position 2, then that would be new information.

We also want to avoid using letters we know are absent (O, S, T).

Let me think of words: 
- BRAVE? But then positions: B, R, A, V, E. But we have R at position 2, which is allowed? However, the secret word might have R at position 2? We don't know.

But note: we are not forced to put R at any particular position, except we know it's not at position 1 and not at 3 (because 3 is A).

So BRAVE: A is at position 3? Position 1: B, 2: R, 3: A -> that matches position 3 A. Then 4: V, 5: E.

But in BRAVE: 
We have R at position 2. Now, if the secret word has R at position 2, it would be correct. Else, it might be elsewhere.

But also, we are introducing new letters: B, V, E.

Another word: ""CRAPE"" but that's not common? Actually, crape might be a word but not very common? Let's think of better.

What about ""TRACE""? But T is eliminated! Because in guess1, T was marked as x, so T is not in the word. So we cannot use T.

TRACE has T and C? But T is out.

Words without O, S, T and with A at position 3 and without R at the beginning? So the structure: [not R, not O, not S, not T] [any] A [any] [any]

And we include R in positions 2,4, or5.

Let me try to list words with A at position 3:

Common words: 
- BOARD: but O is eliminated? BOARD has O and B,O,A,R,D. O is present? But O was marked absent in guess1? So we cannot use BOARD because it has O.

- ""PLAIN"": positions: P, L, A, I, N -> A at 3? Yes. Does it have R? No, we need R, so cannot omit R? Wait no, the feedback requires that we have R? Because R must be in the word.

But in PLAIN, there is no R? But R must be in the secret word? Therefore PLAIN cannot be the word because it doesn't have R.

So any guess we make must include R? Actually, we don't have to, but if we make a guess without R, then we might miss the R? But we are required to find the word? However, we know R is present because feedback said R(-) in the first guess.

Therefore, any valid guess must include R? Not necessarily in terms of guessing strategy: we could exclude R to test other letters? But that wouldn't be efficient because we already know R is in the word, so we want to place R in the word to see where it goes.

Therefore, for this guess, we should include R so we can get feedback on its position.

So let's choose a word that:
- Has A at the third position
- Includes R in either position 2, 4, or 5
- Does not contain O, S, T
- Uses new letters to test

Option: ""BREAK"": but E and K? Positions: B, R, E, A, K -> wait, that structure is _ _ E A K? But we need A at position 3? In ""BREAK"": B R E A K, so positions:
1: B, 2: R, 3: E? Wait no, we need position 3 to be A? We cannot change position 3 because the feedback said that in the secret word, position 3 is A. Therefore, our guess must have A at position 3.

So structure: [1] [2] A [4] [5]

In ""BREAK"", the A is at position 4? Not position 3? So that won't work.

We must have A at position 3.

Another word: ""CRAMP"": C,R,A,M,P -> positions: C, R, A, M, P -> position 3 A? Yes. Also, R is at position 2? So that includes R in position 2.

And letters: C, R, A, M, P -> we haven't tried C, M, P? O,S,T are excluded? Yes.

So ""CRAMP"" could be a guess? But CRAMP might be a noun meaning muscle cramp? It's acceptable.

Alternatively: ""BREAD"" -> B,R,E,A,D -> positions: B,R,E,A,D? Then position 3 is E? We need position 3 to be A? Not correct.

Another word: ""FRAME"": F,R,A,M,E -> positions: F,R,A,M,E -> position 3 A? yes. And letters: F, R (at2), A, M, E -> no O,S,T. And includes R at2.

But we are introducing F,R,A,M,E? We know A is present and in the right position at3? Yes.

FRAME? But let's check: F,R,A,M,E -> position 3 A? Yes.

Another common word: ""GRACE"" -> G,R,A,C,E -> but T not used? And no O,S,T. But note: GRACE does not have T? But we are allowing. And R is at position 2? And A at3.

But we have R at position2? And G and C and E are new.

But note: we are not constrained to avoid repeating letters? But in CRAMP and FRAME and GRACE are all options.

Another one: ""DRAIN"": D,R,A,I,N -> position3 A? yes. R at2.

DRIVE? But then D,R,I,V,E -> position3 would be I? not A.

We need A at3: so we must choose a word that has the letter A in the third position.

Examples: 
BAGEL: B,A,G,E,L -> A at position 2? No, at B (1) A(2) -> not at3.
PLAIN: P,L,A,I,N -> A at3? yes? P-1, L-2, A-3, I-4, N-5? So yes.

But PLAIN has P,L,A,I,N -> no R? But we must include R because R is in the word? However, we know R is in the secret word? So we cannot omit R? Or we can omit it to find out about other letters? But that might not be efficient? Because we know R is there? In PLAIN, we are missing R? So if we guess PLAIN, then we might get R(x) because we didn't include R? But we already know R is in the word? That seems wasteful.

We should guess words containing R? Because we want to find the position of R.

So, options that include R and have A at position3:

- ""CRANE"": C,R,A,N,E -> positions: C,R,A,N,E -> A at3? Position1: C, 2: R, 3: A -> yes. Also, we are introducing C,N,E? No O,S,T? Yes.

However, in feedback for guess1: no mention of C,N,E? So C,N,E could be in the word or not? So ""CRANE"" is a good word? Common starting word? And we are satisfying conditions? And it doesn't use O,S,T.

But wait: we have already eliminated O,S,T? So CRANE? Yes.

But we are on second guess? And CRANE might be good because it has different vowels.

Moreover, CRANE includes E at the end? Position5 E.

So guess ""CRANE"".

Alternatively? ""BRAND"": B,R,A,N,D -> positions: B,R,A,N,D -> A at3? Yes? B at1, R at2, A at3, N at4, D at5? Yes.

But we are introducing R at position2? Same as CRANE? So CRANE versus BRAND? Both have R at2? Let me pick CRANE because it has E? To test E.

But in CRANE: 
Letters: C,R (at2), A,N,E? And position3 is A? Fixed.

So let's go with ""CRANE"".

But note: our first guess ROAST had R at position1? But now we put R at position2? And we know R is in the secret word but not at position1? So possible? Position2 might be correct? Or might be wrong? We'll see.

Also, secret word could have R elsewhere? But we try CRANE.

Therefore, I'll guess ""CRANE"".

But let's confirm: no O,S,T? Correct.

So guess: CRANE

<guess>CRANE</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""ROAST"":
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).
- O is not in the word (marked with `x`).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, marked with `✓`).
- S is not in the word (marked with `x`).
- T is not in the word (marked with `x`).

The secret word must:
- Have the letter A in position 3 (i.e., the pattern is `_ _ A _ _`).
- Include the letter R, but not at position 1.
- Exclude the letters O, S, and T.

For the second guess, I chose ""CRANE"" because:
- It places A in position 3.
- It tests R at position 2 (which is allowed, since R cannot be at position 1).
- It introduces new common consonants (C and N) and a new vowel (E), maximizing information gain.
- It avoids O, S, and T.

If the feedback shows R at position 2 is incorrect, we can narrow down R to position 4 or 5 in future guesses. Additionally, testing E, C, and N will help eliminate or include other letters.

<guess>CRANE</guess>",CRANE,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""ROAST"":
R(-): R is in the word but not in the correct position.
O(x): O is not in the word.
A(✓): A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, if we count positions 1 to 5).

T(x): T is not in the word.

Therefore, we know:

But in BRAVE:

Let me try to list words with A at position 3:

Another one: ""DRAIN"": D,R,A,I,N -> position3 A? yes. R at2.

DRIVE? But then D,R,I,V,E -> position3 would be I? not A.

We need A at3: so we must choose a word that has the letter A in the third position.

Examples: 
BAGEL: B,A,G,E,L -> A at position 2? No, at B (1) A(2) -> not at3.
PLAIN: P,L,A,I,N -> A at3? yes? P-1, L-2, A-3, I-4, N-5? So yes.

But PLAIN has P,L,A,I,N -> no R? But we must include R because R is in the word? However, we know R is in the secret word? So we cannot omit R? Or we can omit it to find out about other letters? But that might not be efficient? Because we know R is there? In PLAIN, we are missing R? So if we guess PLAIN, then we might get R(x) because we didn't include R? But we already know R is in the word? That seems wasteful.

We should guess words containing R? Because we want to find the position of R.

So, options that include R and have A at position3:

- ""CRANE"": C,R,A,N,E -> positions: C,R,A,N,E -> A at3? Position1: C, 2: R, 3: A -> yes. Also, we are introducing C,N,E? No O,S,T? Yes.

However, in feedback for guess1: no mention of C,N,E? So C,N,E could be in the word or not? So ""CRANE"" is a good word? Common starting word? And we are satisfying conditions? And it doesn't use O,S,T.

But wait: we have already eliminated O,S,T? So CRANE? Yes.

But we are on second guess? And CRANE might be good because it has different vowels.

Moreover, CRANE includes E at the end? Position5 E.

So guess ""CRANE"".

Alternatively? ""BRAND"": B,R,A,N,D -> positions: B,R,A,N,D -> A at3? Yes? B at1, R at2, A at3, N at4, D at5? Yes.

But we are introducing R at position2? Same as CRANE? So CRANE versus BRAND? Both have R at2? Let me pick CRANE because it has E? To test E.

But in CRANE: 
Letters: C,R (at2), A,N,E? And position3 is A? Fixed.

So let's go with ""CRANE"".

But note: our first guess ROAST had R at position1? But now we put R at position2? And we know R is in the secret word but not at position1? So possible? Position2 might be correct? Or might be wrong? We'll see.

Also, secret word could have R elsewhere? But we try CRANE.

Therefore, I'll guess ""CRANE"".

But let's confirm: no O,S,T? Correct.

So guess: CRANE

<guess>CRANE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""ROAST"":
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).
- O is not in the word (marked with `x`).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, marked with `✓`).
- S is not in the word (marked with `x`).
- T is not in the word (marked with `x`).

The secret word must:
- Have the letter A in position 3 (i.e., the pattern is `_ _ A _ _`).
- Include the letter R, but not at position 1.
- Exclude the letters O, S, and T.

For the second guess, I chose ""CRANE"" because:
- It places A in position 3.
- It tests R at position 2 (which is allowed, since R cannot be at position 1).
- It introduces new common consonants (C and N) and a new vowel (E), maximizing information gain.
- It avoids O, S, and T.

If the feedback shows R at position 2 is incorrect, we can narrow down R to position 4 or 5 in future guesses. Additionally, testing E, C, and N will help eliminate or include other letters.",Guess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,GUARD,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""ROAST"".

 R, O, A, S, T are all common letters. This might give us good feedback.

 So, my first guess is ""ROAST"".

<guess>ROAST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ROAST -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""ROAST"":
R(-): R is in the word but not in the correct position.
O(x): O is not in the word.
A(✓): A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, if we count positions 1 to 5).
S(x): S is not in the word.
T(x): T is not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The letter A is present and in the 3rd position (since it was correct in ""ROAST"", which is R-O-A-S-T, so A is at position 3).
- R is in the word, but not at position 1 (since it was the first letter and marked as - meaning wrong position).
- O, S, T are not in the word at all.

The secret word has the letter A at position 3: _ _ A _ _

Also, R is present somewhere else in the word, but not at position 1.

Since we have eliminated O, S, T, and O and S were vowels, we might look for other vowels or common consonants.

We have 5 positions to fill. We need to choose a word that:
- Contains R (but not at position 1) and A at position 3.
- Does not contain O, S, T.

Additionally, we can consider that the word must be a common 5-letter English word.

Possible positions for R:
It cannot be at position 1, and since position 3 is A, R can only be at positions 2, 4, or 5.

But note: R might also be repeated? But the feedback for R was given as one occurrence (since we only had one R in ""ROAST""), so the word might have one or more R's? However, the feedback does not specify how many, so we should consider that there is at least one R.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: _ _ A _ _ and include R, but not at the start.

Common letters to try: We might try another vowel. We know O is out, so vowels left: A (we already have one A), E, I, U, and sometimes Y. But A is present and at position 3, and we don't know if there are more As? The feedback doesn't indicate another A because our guess had one A and it was correct, so if there were another A, it would have shown in the feedback? Actually, the feedback per letter is independent. Since we had only one A and it was correct, if there were another A in the word we wouldn't know because we didn't guess a second A. So we have to consider the possibility of multiple As? It's safer to start with the assumption of one A for now.

To maximize information, we should try to include new letters that haven't been tried. We have eliminated O, S, T. We have R and A confirmed.

Let me list the letters we have tried: R, O, A, S, T. So unused letters: most of the alphabet.

We want to test vowels because vowels are common. The vowels we haven't tried: E, I, U (and Y). So we should include one or two of these.

Also, avoid S, O, T.

Possible guess:

We know position 3 is A.

Position 1: cannot be R (because feedback R(-) for position 1). Also, not any letter that is excluded. So any letter except O, S, T and R? But note: position 1 could be another letter that is R? But we have R in the word but not at 1, so position 1 must be a new letter.

We can try a word with E at the beginning or in other positions.

Consider the word ""CRAVE"" but then C is new, R is included? But in ""CRAVE"": positions: C, R, A, V, E. But we know position 3 is A, and if we put A at 3 then R is at position 2? That might be okay.

However, we need to form a word that has A at position 3 and R somewhere else.

But note: our guess must be a word.

Also, in the feedback we were told that R is present but not at position 1 in the secret word. In our new guess, we can have R at any position except we hope it doesn't interfere with the feedback we get.

One idea: try a word with E and I to test those vowels.

We try to build a word:

Position 1: pick a new consonant, say B or C or D, etc.
Position 2: pick a vowel, say E or I or U, so that we can test.
Position 3: A (fixed)
Position 4: maybe R? Or another new letter? Remember R cannot be at position 1 but can be elsewhere.

But R might be at position 4? Or position 5? Or position 2? But if we put R at position 2, then that would be new information.

We also want to avoid using letters we know are absent (O, S, T).

Let me think of words: 
- BRAVE? But then positions: B, R, A, V, E. But we have R at position 2, which is allowed? However, the secret word might have R at position 2? We don't know.

But note: we are not forced to put R at any particular position, except we know it's not at position 1 and not at 3 (because 3 is A).

So BRAVE: A is at position 3? Position 1: B, 2: R, 3: A -> that matches position 3 A. Then 4: V, 5: E.

But in BRAVE: 
We have R at position 2. Now, if the secret word has R at position 2, it would be correct. Else, it might be elsewhere.

But also, we are introducing new letters: B, V, E.

Another word: ""CRAPE"" but that's not common? Actually, crape might be a word but not very common? Let's think of better.

What about ""TRACE""? But T is eliminated! Because in guess1, T was marked as x, so T is not in the word. So we cannot use T.

TRACE has T and C? But T is out.

Words without O, S, T and with A at position 3 and without R at the beginning? So the structure: [not R, not O, not S, not T] [any] A [any] [any]

And we include R in positions 2,4, or5.

Let me try to list words with A at position 3:

Common words: 
- BOARD: but O is eliminated? BOARD has O and B,O,A,R,D. O is present? But O was marked absent in guess1? So we cannot use BOARD because it has O.

- ""PLAIN"": positions: P, L, A, I, N -> A at 3? Yes. Does it have R? No, we need R, so cannot omit R? Wait no, the feedback requires that we have R? Because R must be in the word.

But in PLAIN, there is no R? But R must be in the secret word? Therefore PLAIN cannot be the word because it doesn't have R.

So any guess we make must include R? Actually, we don't have to, but if we make a guess without R, then we might miss the R? But we are required to find the word? However, we know R is present because feedback said R(-) in the first guess.

Therefore, any valid guess must include R? Not necessarily in terms of guessing strategy: we could exclude R to test other letters? But that wouldn't be efficient because we already know R is in the word, so we want to place R in the word to see where it goes.

Therefore, for this guess, we should include R so we can get feedback on its position.

So let's choose a word that:
- Has A at the third position
- Includes R in either position 2, 4, or 5
- Does not contain O, S, T
- Uses new letters to test

Option: ""BREAK"": but E and K? Positions: B, R, E, A, K -> wait, that structure is _ _ E A K? But we need A at position 3? In ""BREAK"": B R E A K, so positions:
1: B, 2: R, 3: E? Wait no, we need position 3 to be A? We cannot change position 3 because the feedback said that in the secret word, position 3 is A. Therefore, our guess must have A at position 3.

So structure: [1] [2] A [4] [5]

In ""BREAK"", the A is at position 4? Not position 3? So that won't work.

We must have A at position 3.

Another word: ""CRAMP"": C,R,A,M,P -> positions: C, R, A, M, P -> position 3 A? Yes. Also, R is at position 2? So that includes R in position 2.

And letters: C, R, A, M, P -> we haven't tried C, M, P? O,S,T are excluded? Yes.

So ""CRAMP"" could be a guess? But CRAMP might be a noun meaning muscle cramp? It's acceptable.

Alternatively: ""BREAD"" -> B,R,E,A,D -> positions: B,R,E,A,D? Then position 3 is E? We need position 3 to be A? Not correct.

Another word: ""FRAME"": F,R,A,M,E -> positions: F,R,A,M,E -> position 3 A? yes. And letters: F, R (at2), A, M, E -> no O,S,T. And includes R at2.

But we are introducing F,R,A,M,E? We know A is present and in the right position at3? Yes.

FRAME? But let's check: F,R,A,M,E -> position 3 A? Yes.

Another common word: ""GRACE"" -> G,R,A,C,E -> but T not used? And no O,S,T. But note: GRACE does not have T? But we are allowing. And R is at position 2? And A at3.

But we have R at position2? And G and C and E are new.

But note: we are not constrained to avoid repeating letters? But in CRAMP and FRAME and GRACE are all options.

Another one: ""DRAIN"": D,R,A,I,N -> position3 A? yes. R at2.

DRIVE? But then D,R,I,V,E -> position3 would be I? not A.

We need A at3: so we must choose a word that has the letter A in the third position.

Examples: 
BAGEL: B,A,G,E,L -> A at position 2? No, at B (1) A(2) -> not at3.
PLAIN: P,L,A,I,N -> A at3? yes? P-1, L-2, A-3, I-4, N-5? So yes.

But PLAIN has P,L,A,I,N -> no R? But we must include R because R is in the word? However, we know R is in the secret word? So we cannot omit R? Or we can omit it to find out about other letters? But that might not be efficient? Because we know R is there? In PLAIN, we are missing R? So if we guess PLAIN, then we might get R(x) because we didn't include R? But we already know R is in the word? That seems wasteful.

We should guess words containing R? Because we want to find the position of R.

So, options that include R and have A at position3:

- ""CRANE"": C,R,A,N,E -> positions: C,R,A,N,E -> A at3? Position1: C, 2: R, 3: A -> yes. Also, we are introducing C,N,E? No O,S,T? Yes.

However, in feedback for guess1: no mention of C,N,E? So C,N,E could be in the word or not? So ""CRANE"" is a good word? Common starting word? And we are satisfying conditions? And it doesn't use O,S,T.

But wait: we have already eliminated O,S,T? So CRANE? Yes.

But we are on second guess? And CRANE might be good because it has different vowels.

Moreover, CRANE includes E at the end? Position5 E.

So guess ""CRANE"".

Alternatively? ""BRAND"": B,R,A,N,D -> positions: B,R,A,N,D -> A at3? Yes? B at1, R at2, A at3, N at4, D at5? Yes.

But we are introducing R at position2? Same as CRANE? So CRANE versus BRAND? Both have R at2? Let me pick CRANE because it has E? To test E.

But in CRANE: 
Letters: C,R (at2), A,N,E? And position3 is A? Fixed.

So let's go with ""CRANE"".

But note: our first guess ROAST had R at position1? But now we put R at position2? And we know R is in the secret word but not at position1? So possible? Position2 might be correct? Or might be wrong? We'll see.

Also, secret word could have R elsewhere? But we try CRANE.

Therefore, I'll guess ""CRANE"".

But let's confirm: no O,S,T? Correct.

So guess: CRANE

<guess>CRANE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""ROAST"":
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).
- O is not in the word (marked with `x`).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, marked with `✓`).
- S is not in the word (marked with `x`).
- T is not in the word (marked with `x`).

The secret word must:
- Have the letter A in position 3 (i.e., the pattern is `_ _ A _ _`).
- Include the letter R, but not at position 1.
- Exclude the letters O, S, and T.

For the second guess, I chose ""CRANE"" because:
- It places A in position 3.
- It tests R at position 2 (which is allowed, since R cannot be at position 1).
- It introduces new common consonants (C and N) and a new vowel (E), maximizing information gain.
- It avoids O, S, and T.

If the feedback shows R at position 2 is incorrect, we can narrow down R to position 4 or 5 in future guesses. Additionally, testing E, C, and N will help eliminate or include other letters.

So that includes R in position 2.\n\nAnd letters: C, R, A, M, P -> we haven\'t tried C, M, P? O,S,T are excluded? Yes.\n\nSo ""CRAMP"" could be a guess? But CRAMP might be a noun meaning muscle cramp? It\'s acceptable.\n\nAlternatively: ""BREAD"" -> B,R,E,A,D -> positions: B,R,E,A,D? Then position 3 is E? We need position 3 to be A? Not correct.\n\nAnother word: ""FRAME"": F,R,A,M,E -> positions: F,R,A,M,E -> position 3 A? yes. And letters: F, R (at2), A, M, E -> no O,S,T. And includes R at2.\n\nBut we are introducing F,R,A,M,E? We know A is present and in the right position at3? Yes.\n\nFRAME? But let\'s check: F,R,A,M,E -> position 3 A? Yes.\n\nAnother common word: ""GRACE"" -> G,R,A,C,E -> but T not used? And no O,S,T. But note: GRACE does not have T? But we are allowing. And R is at position 2? And A at3.\n\nBut we have R at position2? And G and C and E are new.\n\nBut note: we are not constrained to avoid repeating letters? But in CRAMP and FRAME and GRACE are all options.\n\nAnother one: ""DRAIN"": D,R,A,I,N -> position3 A? yes. R at2.\n\nDRIVE? But then D,R,I,V,E -> position3 would be I? not A.\n\nWe need A at3: so we must choose a word that has the letter A in the third position.\n\nExamples: \nBAGEL: B,A,G,E,L -> A at position 2? No, at B (1) A(2) -> not at3.\nPLAIN: P,L,A,I,N -> A at3? yes? P-1, L-2, A-3, I-4, N-5? So yes.\n\nBut PLAIN has P,L,A,I,N -> no R? But we must include R because R is in the word? However, we know R is in the secret word? So we cannot omit R? Or we can omit it to find out about other letters? But that might not be efficient? Because we know R is there? In PLAIN, we are missing R? So if we guess PLAIN, then we might get R(x) because we didn\'t include R? But we already know R is in the word? That seems wasteful.\n\nWe should guess words containing R? Because we want to find the position of R.\n\nSo, options that include R and have A at position3:\n\n- ""CRANE"": C,R,A,N,E -> positions: C,R,A,N,E -> A at3? Position1: C, 2: R, 3: A -> yes. Also, we are introducing C,N,E? No O,S,T? Yes.\n\nHowever, in feedback for guess1: no mention of C,N,E? So C,N,E could be in the word or not? So ""CRANE"" is a good word? Common starting word? And we are satisfying conditions? And it doesn\'t use O,S,T.\n\nBut wait: we have already eliminated O,S,T? So CRANE? Yes.\n\nBut we are on second guess? And CRANE might be good because it has different vowels.\n\nMoreover, CRANE includes E at the end? Position5 E.\n\nSo guess ""CRANE"".\n\nAlternatively? ""BRAND"": B,R,A,N,D -> positions: B,R,A,N,D -> A at3? Yes? B at1, R at2, A at3, N at4, D at5? Yes.\n\nBut we are introducing R at position2? Same as CRANE? So CRANE versus BRAND? Both have R at2? Let me pick CRANE because it has E? To test E.\n\nBut in CRANE: \nLetters: C,R (at2), A,N,E? And position3 is A? Fixed.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""CRANE"".\n\nBut note: our first guess ROAST had R at position1? But now we put R at position2? And we know R is in the secret word but not at position1? So possible? Position2 might be correct? Or might be wrong? We\'ll see.\n\nAlso, secret word could have R elsewhere? But we try CRANE.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""CRANE"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: no O,S,T? Correct.\n\nSo guess: CRANE\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""ROAST"":\n- R is in the word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).\n- O is not in the word (marked with `x`).\n- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, marked with `✓`).\n- S is not in the word (marked with `x`).\n- T is not in the word (marked with `x`).\n\nThe secret word must:\n- Have the letter A in position 3 (i.e., the pattern is `_ _ A _ _`).\n- Include the letter R, but not at position 1.\n- Exclude the letters O, S, and T.\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""CRANE"" because:\n- It places A in position 3.\n- It tests R at position 2 (which is allowed, since R cannot be at position 1).\n- It introduces new common consonants (C and N) and a new vowel (E), maximizing information gain.\n- It avoids O, S, and T.\n\nIf the feedback shows R at position 2 is incorrect, we can narrow down R to position 4 or 5 in future guesses. Additionally, testing E, C, and N will help eliminate or include other letters.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: ROAST -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have two rounds of feedback:

**Guess 1:** ROAST → Feedback: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(x) T(x)
Interpretation:
- R is in the word but not at position 1.
- O is not in the word.
- A is in the word and at position 3 (since it was guessed there and is correct).
- S is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.

**Implications from Guess 1:**
- Secret word has pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Contains R (exactly one occurrence? at least one; since only one R guessed, position unknown but not 1)
- Excludes O, S, T.

**Guess 2:** CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not at position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 and is marked wrong position).
- A is still correct at position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

**Updated Implications:**
- Pattern: still _ _ A _ _
- R is present, but not at position 1 (from first guess) nor position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, R must be at position 4 or 5.
- Excluded letters: O, S, T, C, N, E.

Also, since R cannot be at positions 1 or 2, it must be at position 4 or 5 in the secret word.

Moreover, we've ruled out quite a few vowels: O, E are gone. Only vowels left: I and U (and Y? but Y is often used as a consonant). Considering Y? But let's note.

The word must have R in the 4th or 5th position. Let's denote positions: 1,2,3 = A, 4,5.

Also, position 3 is fixed as A.

We need to form a word that fits _ _ A (R?) ... meaning:
- First character: unknown, not any of the excluded letters (O,S,T,C,N,E), and not A (because A is at position 3? Wait, could there be another A? We don't know yet).

Excluded list: O, S, T, C, N, E.
Forbidden? Letters: O, S, T, C, N, E.

Must include R exactly at position 4 or 5? At least once, but could be more? But we'll start minimal.

Now, R must be present. Since it wasn't in position 1 or 2, and we haven't guessed it elsewhere? Only at 2? So R must be at 4 or 5.

Thus, the word looks either:
- Pattern A: ? ? A R _ 
- Or Pattern B: ? ? A _ R

Where ? represents any letter, but must be from the remaining alphabet? What we haven't eliminated.

Also, we haven't tried many letters? So vowels: we tried E, O, and A is used? Remaining vowels: I and U. And Y? 

We should test these vowels? And consonants? Common consonants left: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? But exclude Y because sometimes vowel? Actually, we can test Y.

We need to make a guess that includes R at either position 4 or 5? Why? Because we need to find out where R is? Also, to cover both options? But we have to pick one.

But we can design a guess that includes R at a position? For example, R at position 4? Then we can see.

Let's think of words matching pattern A: ? ? A R _

Or pattern B: ? ? A _ R

Possibly, we could construct a word that tests one pattern? But we might have to choose arbitrarily.

Also, we should include one or two new vowels so we can find out? If there is a vowel in the word? We have only A so far? So perhaps the word has other vowels? Like I or U.

Try to include I or U? Because we haven't tested them? Therefore, let's choose a word that uses I or U? And one of the pattern above.

But R must be in position 4 or 5? So if we choose R at position 4, then pattern ? ? A R ?

Then the last letter is unknown? And if R at position 5, pattern ? ? A ? R.

Now, let's list some words:

For pattern A: ? ? A R _

Examples: 
- MADR? → MADRE not English? Or MADRI? not word.
- PADR? Something? Not common words.
- FA?AR → FAIRY? But 5 letters? FA? A R? Oh, perhaps FAIR? But FAIR is 4 letters? Not 5.

Wait, we need 5 letters. Pattern: positions: 1,2,3=A,4=R,5=?

So words: 
- LIAR? Wait, LIARS is 5 letters? LIARS has positions: L(1), I(2), A(3), R(4), S(5). But S is eliminated! From feedback1: S(x) not in word? So LIARS is out because S cannot be at end? And no S in word? So LIARS excluded? Also E has at end? But E eliminated? In feedback2: E(x), so not in word.

Other words: with A at3, R at4? 
- HEARD? H(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). But E was eliminated? feedback2: E(x) → not in word? So HEARD has E? Cannot use E.
- BAZAR? But Z? B,A,Z,A,R? Not standard? And A at1? Not: BA? First letter B, second A? Then at position 3? BAZAR: B(1), A(2), Z(3)? Not A at3? Wrong pattern.

Think differently: common words with A at3 and R at4:

- CARDS: C,A,R,D,S? Then the A would be at position 2? Not at 3? And C eliminated? Also S eliminated? No.
Maybe: ""AUDI"" something? Not 5 letters.

Consider alternate pattern: R at position 5: ? ? A _ R

Pattern: positions: 1,2,3=A,4=?,5=R

Words: 
- GUITAR? Too long, 6 letters. Not 5.
- HEART -> HEART is 5? H(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), T(5). But E and T eliminated! E was eliminated in guess2? And T eliminated in guess1? So HEART cannot be? Because it has E and T.
- EARTH -> similar issue? And E,A,R,T,H → but E and T eliminated? Yes? EARTH positions: E(1), A(2), R(3) → not A at3? Pattern requires A at position 3? EARTH: E,A,R,T,H → A is at2? Yes? So not.

We need A at position3? Exactly? Therefore:

? ? A ? ?

And R at4 or at5.

Since R must be at position4 or5? So the secret word is either:

Case1: _ _ A R _

Case2: _ _ A _ R

Now, find words satisfying? Without excluded letters? Excluded: O,S,T,C,N,E.

Also, letters used: R and A? And from first guess? We tried ROAST and CRANE? So letters tried: R,O,A,S,T,C,N,E? So unavailable? Should not use? Unless? Actually, only exclude O,S,T,C,N,E? And other letters free? But we must include R? And A at position3.

So possible letters? For position1: any letter except R (R cannot be position1, and not O,S,T,C,N,E? Also, position3 is fixed A? But what about duplicate letters? For example, could position1 be A? The feedback didn't show? But in guess1: ROAST had R O A S T → A marked correct at position3? Did not indicate about other A? So maybe duplicate A is possible? For example, two A? But ROAST had one A at3? So if there is another A, we might not know.

Similarly in CRANE? Had A at3? Correct? But if there is another A? Not guessed? So possible? So we should not rule out duplicates? But at position1 or other we could have A? But wait, pattern? Position3 has A? If position1 is A? Then secret would have A at1? Also A at3? So words like ABACK? Or ALARM? Etc? But ALARM might work? Check pattern.

ALARM: A at1? L at2? A at3? R at4? M at5? So pattern: positions: 1 A, 2 L, 3 A, 4 R, 5 M? Yes? Also, R at position4? So case1 pattern: _ _ A R _

Now, letters: ALARM → but L, R, M only? But we haven't tried these? And excluded? Letters: A,L,A,R,M? We have tried A? But duplicate A? Okay? Also, excluded letters? O,S,T,C,N,E not in here? So ALARM could be candidate? But our guess? Or we have to guess it? But we need to test?

But we are trying to make a guess? So perhaps we can guess ALARM? But let's see whether it fits the feedback? We don't know yet? It'll give feedback.

But we are on guess3? We have information gap? We don't have information about other positions? So we should design a guess that tests? 

But let's find words:

Pattern A: _ _ A R _
Words: ALARM? (A,L,A,R,M) → but we are making guess, so we can? ALARM: if guessed, position3 is A? Correct? Position4 is R? If secret has R at4, then ✓, else? But in our guess, ALARM has the following letters: A (pos1), L (pos2), A (pos3), R (pos4), M (pos5).

So on guess:
We know: A at pos3? Correct? But we might have letter at pos1: A? Which if secret has A at1, then ✓? Else?
Similarly R at pos4? Which, we thought R could be there? Or at5? So this word ALARM tests? Pos1 as A? And R at4? Also, L and M? New letters? And duplicate A? Not bad? But position3 is fixed? So we test? 

But pattern B: _ _ A _ R 
Words: HAIR? 4 letters? Too small? HEART? We saw? EARTH? Not pattern? How about BAR? 3 letters. Need 5 letters? Like ""FREAR""? Not word? Probably not common.

Another word? ""POLAR""? P,O,L,A,R → positions: P(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R(5)? But pattern requires A at position3? Not4? And O eliminated? O not allowed? So cannot?

""AVIAR"" → not word? 

Possible word: ""DENAR""? Not common? ""DINAR""? DINAR is a currency? Letters: D,I,N,A,R? Positions: D1, I2, N3? N at3? We need A at3? No? DINAR: D,I,N at1,2,3 but we require A at3? So N at3? Not? 

Another? ""MANOR""? M,A,N,O,R? Positions: M1,A2,N3,O4,R5? But A at2? We require A at3? Also O is excluded? N excluded? E? Etc? Not pattern.

Perhaps no common word for pattern B? Then pattern A is more likely? Therefore, focus on pattern A? Meaning R must be at position4.

But let's confirm via word list? Possible 5-letter words with A at3, R at4? Ending with any letter?

Examples: 
- LIAR? But 4 letters? Then LIARS? But S eliminated? Not.
- LEARI Not word?
- CLEAR? But C and E eliminated? No.
- UNAIR Not word.
- RADAR? R,A,D at1,2,3? Then R at4? RADAR: positions: R1,A2,D3,A4,R5? Then A at2 and 4? But at position3? It's D? So not A at3? Wrong pattern.

What about words that specifically have the third letter A and fourth R?

Like: STAIR? But S and T eliminated? And T? STAIR: S1,T2,A3,I4,R5? But S,T eliminated? Cannot.

PIAR? Not word? Perhaps QIAR? Not.

GAMER? G,A,M,E,R? But E eliminated, and positions? G1,A2,M3,E4,R5? Position3 M? We need A at3? Should be? But here A at2? So not.

Another: BALMY? Then? B,A,L,M,Y? Positions: B1,A2,L3,M4,Y5? Position3 L? But we need position3=A? So? Not.

So? How about BOARD? But O eliminated? And BOARD: B,O,A,R,D? Positions: B1,O2,A3,R4,D5? Pattern: ? ? A R _ → here it fits: B O A R D? But O eliminated? Cannot.

Similarly, GUARD: G,U,A,R,D? Positions: G1,U2,A3,R4,D5? And letters: G,U,A,R,D? G and U unknown? But D? We haven't tested? So this word: GUARD? But U and G? And D?

But O,S,T,C,N,E eliminated? Neither G nor U is excluded? So GUARD is a possible word? Because:
- Pattern: ? ? A R _ → positions 3=A, 4=R? And 5=D? 1=G? 2=U?
-
GUARD: letters G,U,A,R,D. Position3 A? Position4 R? Perfect pattern A? Excludes none of the forbidden letters? Therefore, possible.

Similarly, ALARM? But ALARM: A,L,A,R,M? Position1 A? Position3 A? Position4 R? So if guessed: 
- If secret does not have A at pos1? Then mark for pos1: since A is present, but if not at pos1? Then -? But in secret word, probably? We don't know.

Also, ALARM? We can guess? But GUARD? Seems common? 

Similarly, other candidates: 
- WEARY? But W,E,A,R,Y? But E eliminated? Cannot.
- HEARD? E eliminated? Cannot.
- PAR? PARER? Not? 

Another: BAWD? 4 letters? Or BAWDY? 5? B,A,W,D,Y? Positions: B1,A2,W3,D4,Y5? Position2 A? We need position3 A? So not? 

FLARE? F,L,A,R,E? But E eliminated? Cannot.

Therefore, strong candidate: GUARD? Also BARMY? But BARMY: B,A,R,M,Y? Positions B1,A2,R3,M4,Y5? Not A at3? 

ADORE: A,D,O,R,E? O and E eliminated? Cannot.

So GUARD? Yes? Or similarly, WA? WARP? But W,A,R,P? Not 5? W,R at1 and2? How about HAREM? But H,A,R,E,M? E eliminated? 

LA? LARVA? L,A,R,V,A? Positions L1,A2,R3,V4,A5? Position2 and5? We need position3 A? Not? 

Perhaps ""MARV"" something? Not.

So let's list possible words fitting pattern A:
- GUARD (G,U,A,R,D)

Pattern B: R at5? Possible words: ? ? A _ R
Like: 
- SWAMP? But S eliminated? 
- STAMP? S,T eliminated? 
- SCRAM? C,S eliminated? 
- G? GAMER? Already? Not.
- SH? SHARE? S and E eliminated? 
- FA? FAIR? 4 letters? FAIRY? But 5: F,A,I,R,Y? Positions F1,A2,I3,R4,Y5? Position2 A? We need A at3? Not? 

PLACE? Not? But A not at3? 

Similarly, RACER? R,A,C,E,R? Eliminated C,E? And R at1? But R cannot be pos1? Also? 

Therefore, maybe pattern B has fewer common words? Therefore? Assume pattern A? R at position4? And then the word is G U A R D? Or other? 

Other candidates? LAIRS? S eliminated? BAURS? Not word? 

Perhaps ""PLAZA""? P,L,A,Z,A? Positions P1,L2,A3,Z4,A5? Then R not? But R must be? Because from feedback? R must be included? So PLAZA has no R? Cannot? Because feedback said R(-) twice? Therefore, R in secret? So PLAZA cannot? 

Also, ""MANIA""? M A N I A? No R? And N eliminated? Cannot? 

Another? ""HAIKU""? H A I K U? No R? Cannot? 

So, GUARD seems a candidate? Also ""VAPOR""? But O eliminated? No? 

So? Then let's guess GUARD? But we don't know? We have to test? But note: we haven't tested the letters G,U,D? So we could guess GUARD? But let's verify? 

In the pattern? We have position1? And position2? Both unknown? So we can test? 

Alternative: since we haven't tested vowels I and U? And we suspect R at position4? Then let's make a guess? That tests remaining vowels? And includes R at position4? 

So guess? For example? Why not GUARD? Or LAIRD? But L A I R D? But positions L1 A2 I3 R4 D5? Then position3 I? Not A? But we require position3 A? So? Not? 

Therefore, only GUARD? That I can think of? Also ""QUART""? Q,U,A,R,T? But T eliminated? Cannot? 

""EARLD""? Not word? 

So? We have GUARD? And maybe ""YUCCA""? But no R? And Y,U,A? Position? Y1 U2 C3 C4 A5? Position3 C? Not A? 

Therefore, perhaps pattern should be R at position5? Because pattern B.

Pattern B: _ _ A _ R

Words: 
- COWER? But O,E eliminated? 
- BOWER? O,E eliminated? 
- POWER? O,E eliminated? 
- TOWER? T,O,E eliminated? 
- D? DECRY? D,E,C,R,Y? C,E eliminated? 
- AW? AWARE? A,W,A,R,E? But E eliminated? And positions: A1,W2,A3,R4,E5? Then position3 A? And R at4? But we are looking for R at5? Position5 is E? Eliminated? 

So? Maybe no common word? But alternative: FEWER? E? No?
Consider: the word ""SUGAR""? But S eliminated? S,U,G,A,R? Positions S1,U2,G3,A4,R5? Position4 A? But we need position3 A? So position3 is G? Not? Therefore incorrect pattern?

Similarly, ""JUMAR""? J,U,M,A,R? Positions J1,U2,M3,A4,R5? Position4=A? Need position3=A? So not? 

Maybe: T? TISAR? Not common? And T eliminated? 

Therefore, perhaps the only common candidate is GUARD? So we guess GUARD? But let's see? 

Alternatively? There might be other words?

Another pattern A word: ""MADRE""? Not English? 

""CADRE""? But C eliminated? 

""FADER""? F,A,D,E,R? But E eliminated? 

So? Probably GUARD is the best candidate? So we can guess GUARD? Then? 

But note: GUARD has U at position2? Which is a vowel we haven't tried? That's good? And we test G,U,D? Also R at position4? 

But we know R is in the word? Position4 might be? Also, by guessing, we see? 

So our guess: GUARD

But let's think: the secret word could have R at5? And a different word? We'll have to see feedback? 

Also, from rules? We must guess? And if GUARD is not the word? We get feedback? 

Second possibility: the secret word might have duplicate letters? For example? Two A? Then words? Like APPAL? But positions A1,P2,P3,A4,L5? Then position3 P? Not A? Unless we have A at3? 

Consider: ""ALARM"" (A,L,A,R,M) with A at1 and3? And R at4? We discarded it because? But ALARM: A1,L2,A3,R4,M5? Pattern: ? ? A R ? → position3 A? Position4 R? So fits pattern A? And letters: A,L,A,R,M? We have tried A? But duplicate? 

Forbidden letters: none? O,S,T,C,N,E are excluded correctly? So ALARM? Is possible? Also GUARD? 

And also ""BAR"" something? BARRA? BARRE? Not common? 

Perhaps ""AMAR"" something? AMARE? Not English? 

Other? ""HAVOC""? H,A,V,O,C? O,C eliminated? 

Therefore, possible words: GUARD and ALARM? 

How to choose? We can guess GUARD? 

But note: for ALARM? The letters: A at1? If secret word is ALARM? Then? 

For GUARD: G,U,A,R,D? Position1 new letter? 

Because we don't know about position1? We could test consonant? 

Let's make a guess that uses new letters? And tests R at position4? Or5? 

But R must be at either position4 or5? So we can include R at position4 in our guess? For example? 

Guess: GU? So GUARD? 

Alternatively? We can guess a word that contains R at position4? And tests new? Including U? But we don't know if U is in the word? 

Similarly? Another idea: include 'I'? Because we haven't tested I? 

But GUARD and ALARM? ALARM has L and M? 

But? Let's consider? 

We could guess ""BUILT""? But not pattern? Pattern requires A at3? 

To choose? Let's think strategy: we need to learn about position1 and position2? 

If we guess GUARD? Then:
- If U at2 is correct? Then mark ✓? Else? Etc? 

Similarly, ALARM? 

But? We can propose ALARM? Or GUARD? Both reasonable? 

I'll go with GUARD for now? Because we tested A? Duplicate? Less common? 

So? Guess: GUARD

But write: <guess>GUARD</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from both guesses:

1. **Guess 1: ROAST → Feedback: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(x) T(x)**  
   - A is confirmed in position 3 (secret word pattern: \_ \_ A \_ \_).  
   - R is in the word but not at position 1.  
   - O, S, T are not in the word.

2. **Guess 2: CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)**  
   - R is in the word but not at position 2.  
   - C, N, E are not in the word.  
   - Confirmed A still at position 3.

**Key deductions:**  
- The secret word pattern is \_ \_ A \_ \_.  
- R must be present but not at positions 1 or 2, so it must be at position 4 or 5.  
- Excluded letters: O, S, T, C, N, E.  
- Remaining vowels to test: I, U, and possibly Y (as it can function as a vowel).  
- Position 1 and 2 must be filled with new letters from the remaining alphabet (avoiding exclusions).  

**Strategy for this guess:**  
- Focus on words with R at position 4 or 5 to help locate R.  
- Test new common vowels (U or I) since only A has been confirmed so far.  
- Avoid excluded letters and reuse of confirmed positions where possible.  
- The word ""GUARD"" fits:  
  - Pattern: G U A R D → positions: 1=G, 2=U, 3=A (confirmed), 4=R, 5=D.  
  - Tests R at position 4 (could reveal if R is correctly placed at 4 or if it should be at 5).  
  - Tests U and D/G, filling gaps with new letters.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (O, S, T, C, N, E).  

If ""GUARD"" is incorrect, the feedback will help narrow R's position and reveal if U, G, or D are present.

<guess>GUARD</guess>",GUARD,"We have two rounds of feedback:

**Guess 1:** ROAST → Feedback: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(x) T(x)
Interpretation:
- R is in the word but not at position 1.
- O is not in the word.
- A is in the word and at position 3 (since it was guessed there and is correct).
- S is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.

**Implications from Guess 1:**
- Secret word has pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Contains R (exactly one occurrence? at least one; since only one R guessed, position unknown but not 1)
- Excludes O, S, T.

**Guess 2:** CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but not at position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 and is marked wrong position).
- A is still correct at position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

**Updated Implications:**
- Pattern: still _ _ A _ _
- R is present, but not at position 1 (from first guess) nor position 2 (from second guess). Therefore, R must be at position 4 or 5.
- Excluded letters: O, S, T, C, N, E.

Also, since R cannot be at positions 1 or 2, it must be at position 4 or 5 in the secret word.

Moreover, we've ruled out quite a few vowels: O, E are gone. Only vowels left: I and U (and Y? but Y is often used as a consonant). Considering Y? But let's note.

The word must have R in the 4th or 5th position. Let's denote positions: 1,2,3 = A, 4,5.

Also, position 3 is fixed as A.

We need to form a word that fits _ _ A (R?) ... meaning:
- First character: unknown, not any of the excluded letters (O,S,T,C,N,E), and not A (because A is at position 3? Wait, could there be another A? We don't know yet).

Excluded list: O, S, T, C, N, E.
Forbidden? Letters: O, S, T, C, N, E.

Must include R exactly at position 4 or 5? At least once, but could be more? But we'll start minimal.

Now, R must be present. Since it wasn't in position 1 or 2, and we haven't guessed it elsewhere? Only at 2? So R must be at 4 or 5.

Thus, the word looks either:
- Pattern A: ? ? A R _ 
- Or Pattern B: ? ? A _ R

Where ? represents any letter, but must be from the remaining alphabet? What we haven't eliminated.

Also, we haven't tried many letters? So vowels: we tried E, O, and A is used? Remaining vowels: I and U. And Y? 

We should test these vowels? And consonants? Common consonants left: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? But exclude Y because sometimes vowel? Actually, we can test Y.

We need to make a guess that includes R at either position 4 or 5? Why? Because we need to find out where R is? Also, to cover both options? But we have to pick one.

But we can design a guess that includes R at a position? For example, R at position 4? Then we can see.

Let's think of words matching pattern A: ? ? A R _

Or pattern B: ? ? A _ R

Possibly, we could construct a word that tests one pattern? But we might have to choose arbitrarily.

Also, we should include one or two new vowels so we can find out? If there is a vowel in the word? We have only A so far? So perhaps the word has other vowels? Like I or U.

Try to include I or U? Because we haven't tested them? Therefore, let's choose a word that uses I or U? And one of the pattern above.

But R must be in position 4 or 5? So if we choose R at position 4, then pattern ? ? A R ?

Then the last letter is unknown? And if R at position 5, pattern ? ? A ? R.

Now, let's list some words:

For pattern A: ? ? A R _

Examples: 
- MADR? → MADRE not English? Or MADRI? not word.
- PADR? Something? Not common words.
- FA?AR → FAIRY? But 5 letters? FA? A R? Oh, perhaps FAIR? But FAIR is 4 letters? Not 5.

Wait, we need 5 letters. Pattern: positions: 1,2,3=A,4=R,5=?

So words: 
- LIAR? Wait, LIARS is 5 letters? LIARS has positions: L(1), I(2), A(3), R(4), S(5). But S is eliminated! From feedback1: S(x) not in word? So LIARS is out because S cannot be at end? And no S in word? So LIARS excluded? Also E has at end? But E eliminated? In feedback2: E(x), so not in word.

Other words: with A at3, R at4? 
- HEARD? H(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), D(5). But E was eliminated? feedback2: E(x) → not in word? So HEARD has E? Cannot use E.
- BAZAR? But Z? B,A,Z,A,R? Not standard? And A at1? Not: BA? First letter B, second A? Then at position 3? BAZAR: B(1), A(2), Z(3)? Not A at3? Wrong pattern.

Think differently: common words with A at3 and R at4:

- CARDS: C,A,R,D,S? Then the A would be at position 2? Not at 3? And C eliminated? Also S eliminated? No.
Maybe: ""AUDI"" something? Not 5 letters.

Consider alternate pattern: R at position 5: ? ? A _ R

Pattern: positions: 1,2,3=A,4=?,5=R

Words: 
- GUITAR? Too long, 6 letters. Not 5.
- HEART -> HEART is 5? H(1), E(2), A(3), R(4), T(5). But E and T eliminated! E was eliminated in guess2? And T eliminated in guess1? So HEART cannot be? Because it has E and T.
- EARTH -> similar issue? And E,A,R,T,H → but E and T eliminated? Yes? EARTH positions: E(1), A(2), R(3) → not A at3? Pattern requires A at position 3? EARTH: E,A,R,T,H → A is at2? Yes? So not.

We need A at position3? Exactly? Therefore:

? ? A ? ?

And R at4 or at5.

Since R must be at position4 or5? So the secret word is either:

Case1: _ _ A R _

Case2: _ _ A _ R

Now, find words satisfying? Without excluded letters? Excluded: O,S,T,C,N,E.

Also, letters used: R and A? And from first guess? We tried ROAST and CRANE? So letters tried: R,O,A,S,T,C,N,E? So unavailable? Should not use? Unless? Actually, only exclude O,S,T,C,N,E? And other letters free? But we must include R? And A at position3.

So possible letters? For position1: any letter except R (R cannot be position1, and not O,S,T,C,N,E? Also, position3 is fixed A? But what about duplicate letters? For example, could position1 be A? The feedback didn't show? But in guess1: ROAST had R O A S T → A marked correct at position3? Did not indicate about other A? So maybe duplicate A is possible? For example, two A? But ROAST had one A at3? So if there is another A, we might not know.

Similarly in CRANE? Had A at3? Correct? But if there is another A? Not guessed? So possible? So we should not rule out duplicates? But at position1 or other we could have A? But wait, pattern? Position3 has A? If position1 is A? Then secret would have A at1? Also A at3? So words like ABACK? Or ALARM? Etc? But ALARM might work? Check pattern.

ALARM: A at1? L at2? A at3? R at4? M at5? So pattern: positions: 1 A, 2 L, 3 A, 4 R, 5 M? Yes? Also, R at position4? So case1 pattern: _ _ A R _

Now, letters: ALARM → but L, R, M only? But we haven't tried these? And excluded? Letters: A,L,A,R,M? We have tried A? But duplicate A? Okay? Also, excluded letters? O,S,T,C,N,E not in here? So ALARM could be candidate? But our guess? Or we have to guess it? But we need to test?

But we are trying to make a guess? So perhaps we can guess ALARM? But let's see whether it fits the feedback? We don't know yet? It'll give feedback.

But we are on guess3? We have information gap? We don't have information about other positions? So we should design a guess that tests? 

But let's find words:

Pattern A: _ _ A R _
Words: ALARM? (A,L,A,R,M) → but we are making guess, so we can? ALARM: if guessed, position3 is A? Correct? Position4 is R? If secret has R at4, then ✓, else? But in our guess, ALARM has the following letters: A (pos1), L (pos2), A (pos3), R (pos4), M (pos5).

So on guess:
We know: A at pos3? Correct? But we might have letter at pos1: A? Which if secret has A at1, then ✓? Else?
Similarly R at pos4? Which, we thought R could be there? Or at5? So this word ALARM tests? Pos1 as A? And R at4? Also, L and M? New letters? And duplicate A? Not bad? But position3 is fixed? So we test? 

But pattern B: _ _ A _ R 
Words: HAIR? 4 letters? Too small? HEART? We saw? EARTH? Not pattern? How about BAR? 3 letters. Need 5 letters? Like ""FREAR""? Not word? Probably not common.

Another word? ""POLAR""? P,O,L,A,R → positions: P(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R(5)? But pattern requires A at position3? Not4? And O eliminated? O not allowed? So cannot?

""AVIAR"" → not word? 

Possible word: ""DENAR""? Not common? ""DINAR""? DINAR is a currency? Letters: D,I,N,A,R? Positions: D1, I2, N3? N at3? We need A at3? No? DINAR: D,I,N at1,2,3 but we require A at3? So N at3? Not? 

Another? ""MANOR""? M,A,N,O,R? Positions: M1,A2,N3,O4,R5? But A at2? We require A at3? Also O is excluded? N excluded? E? Etc? Not pattern.

Perhaps no common word for pattern B? Then pattern A is more likely? Therefore, focus on pattern A? Meaning R must be at position4.

But let's confirm via word list? Possible 5-letter words with A at3, R at4? Ending with any letter?

Examples: 
- LIAR? But 4 letters? Then LIARS? But S eliminated? Not.
- LEARI Not word?
- CLEAR? But C and E eliminated? No.
- UNAIR Not word.
- RADAR? R,A,D at1,2,3? Then R at4? RADAR: positions: R1,A2,D3,A4,R5? Then A at2 and 4? But at position3? It's D? So not A at3? Wrong pattern.

What about words that specifically have the third letter A and fourth R?

Like: STAIR? But S and T eliminated? And T? STAIR: S1,T2,A3,I4,R5? But S,T eliminated? Cannot.

PIAR? Not word? Perhaps QIAR? Not.

GAMER? G,A,M,E,R? But E eliminated, and positions? G1,A2,M3,E4,R5? Position3 M? We need A at3? Should be? But here A at2? So not.

Another: BALMY? Then? B,A,L,M,Y? Positions: B1,A2,L3,M4,Y5? Position3 L? But we need position3=A? So? Not.

So? How about BOARD? But O eliminated? And BOARD: B,O,A,R,D? Positions: B1,O2,A3,R4,D5? Pattern: ? ? A R _ → here it fits: B O A R D? But O eliminated? Cannot.

Similarly, GUARD: G,U,A,R,D? Positions: G1,U2,A3,R4,D5? And letters: G,U,A,R,D? G and U unknown? But D? We haven't tested? So this word: GUARD? But U and G? And D?

But O,S,T,C,N,E eliminated? Neither G nor U is excluded? So GUARD is a possible word? Because:
- Pattern: ? ? A R _ → positions 3=A, 4=R? And 5=D? 1=G? 2=U?
-
GUARD: letters G,U,A,R,D. Position3 A? Position4 R? Perfect pattern A? Excludes none of the forbidden letters? Therefore, possible.

Similarly, ALARM? But ALARM: A,L,A,R,M? Position1 A? Position3 A? Position4 R? So if guessed: 
- If secret does not have A at pos1? Then mark for pos1: since A is present, but if not at pos1? Then -? But in secret word, probably? We don't know.

Also, ALARM? We can guess? But GUARD? Seems common? 

Similarly, other candidates: 
- WEARY? But W,E,A,R,Y? But E eliminated? Cannot.
- HEARD? E eliminated? Cannot.
- PAR? PARER? Not? 

Another: BAWD? 4 letters? Or BAWDY? 5? B,A,W,D,Y? Positions: B1,A2,W3,D4,Y5? Position2 A? We need position3 A? So not? 

FLARE? F,L,A,R,E? But E eliminated? Cannot.

Therefore, strong candidate: GUARD? Also BARMY? But BARMY: B,A,R,M,Y? Positions B1,A2,R3,M4,Y5? Not A at3? 

ADORE: A,D,O,R,E? O and E eliminated? Cannot.

So GUARD? Yes? Or similarly, WA? WARP? But W,A,R,P? Not 5? W,R at1 and2? How about HAREM? But H,A,R,E,M? E eliminated? 

LA? LARVA? L,A,R,V,A? Positions L1,A2,R3,V4,A5? Position2 and5? We need position3 A? Not? 

Perhaps ""MARV"" something? Not.

So let's list possible words fitting pattern A:
- GUARD (G,U,A,R,D)

Pattern B: R at5? Possible words: ? ? A _ R
Like: 
- SWAMP? But S eliminated? 
- STAMP? S,T eliminated? 
- SCRAM? C,S eliminated? 
- G? GAMER? Already? Not.
- SH? SHARE? S and E eliminated? 
- FA? FAIR? 4 letters? FAIRY? But 5: F,A,I,R,Y? Positions F1,A2,I3,R4,Y5? Position2 A? We need A at3? Not? 

PLACE? Not? But A not at3? 

Similarly, RACER? R,A,C,E,R? Eliminated C,E? And R at1? But R cannot be pos1? Also? 

Therefore, maybe pattern B has fewer common words? Therefore? Assume pattern A? R at position4? And then the word is G U A R D? Or other? 

Other candidates? LAIRS? S eliminated? BAURS? Not word? 

Perhaps ""PLAZA""? P,L,A,Z,A? Positions P1,L2,A3,Z4,A5? Then R not? But R must be? Because from feedback? R must be included? So PLAZA has no R? Cannot? Because feedback said R(-) twice? Therefore, R in secret? So PLAZA cannot? 

Also, ""MANIA""? M A N I A? No R? And N eliminated? Cannot? 

Another? ""HAIKU""? H A I K U? No R? Cannot? 

So, GUARD seems a candidate? Also ""VAPOR""? But O eliminated? No? 

So? Then let's guess GUARD? But we don't know? We have to test? But note: we haven't tested the letters G,U,D? So we could guess GUARD? But let's verify? 

In the pattern? We have position1? And position2? Both unknown? So we can test? 

Alternative: since we haven't tested vowels I and U? And we suspect R at position4? Then let's make a guess? That tests remaining vowels? And includes R at position4? 

So guess? For example? Why not GUARD? Or LAIRD? But L A I R D? But positions L1 A2 I3 R4 D5? Then position3 I? Not A? But we require position3 A? So? Not? 

Therefore, only GUARD? That I can think of? Also ""QUART""? Q,U,A,R,T? But T eliminated? Cannot? 

""EARLD""? Not word? 

So? We have GUARD? And maybe ""YUCCA""? But no R? And Y,U,A? Position? Y1 U2 C3 C4 A5? Position3 C? Not A? 

Therefore, perhaps pattern should be R at position5? Because pattern B.

Pattern B: _ _ A _ R

Words: 
- COWER? But O,E eliminated? 
- BOWER? O,E eliminated? 
- POWER? O,E eliminated? 
- TOWER? T,O,E eliminated? 
- D? DECRY? D,E,C,R,Y? C,E eliminated? 
- AW? AWARE? A,W,A,R,E? But E eliminated? And positions: A1,W2,A3,R4,E5? Then position3 A? And R at4? But we are looking for R at5? Position5 is E? Eliminated? 

So? Maybe no common word? But alternative: FEWER? E? No?
Consider: the word ""SUGAR""? But S eliminated? S,U,G,A,R? Positions S1,U2,G3,A4,R5? Position4 A? But we need position3 A? So position3 is G? Not? Therefore incorrect pattern?

Similarly, ""JUMAR""? J,U,M,A,R? Positions J1,U2,M3,A4,R5? Position4=A? Need position3=A? So not? 

Maybe: T? TISAR? Not common? And T eliminated? 

Therefore, perhaps the only common candidate is GUARD? So we guess GUARD? But let's see? 

Alternatively? There might be other words?

Another pattern A word: ""MADRE""? Not English? 

""CADRE""? But C eliminated? 

""FADER""? F,A,D,E,R? But E eliminated? 

So? Probably GUARD is the best candidate? So we can guess GUARD? Then? 

But note: GUARD has U at position2? Which is a vowel we haven't tried? That's good? And we test G,U,D? Also R at position4? 

But we know R is in the word? Position4 might be? Also, by guessing, we see? 

So our guess: GUARD

But let's think: the secret word could have R at5? And a different word? We'll have to see feedback? 

Also, from rules? We must guess? And if GUARD is not the word? We get feedback? 

Second possibility: the secret word might have duplicate letters? For example? Two A? Then words? Like APPAL? But positions A1,P2,P3,A4,L5? Then position3 P? Not A? Unless we have A at3? 

Consider: ""ALARM"" (A,L,A,R,M) with A at1 and3? And R at4? We discarded it because? But ALARM: A1,L2,A3,R4,M5? Pattern: ? ? A R ? → position3 A? Position4 R? So fits pattern A? And letters: A,L,A,R,M? We have tried A? But duplicate? 

Forbidden letters: none? O,S,T,C,N,E are excluded correctly? So ALARM? Is possible? Also GUARD? 

And also ""BAR"" something? BARRA? BARRE? Not common? 

Perhaps ""AMAR"" something? AMARE? Not English? 

Other? ""HAVOC""? H,A,V,O,C? O,C eliminated? 

Therefore, possible words: GUARD and ALARM? 

How to choose? We can guess GUARD? 

But note: for ALARM? The letters: A at1? If secret word is ALARM? Then? 

For GUARD: G,U,A,R,D? Position1 new letter? 

Because we don't know about position1? We could test consonant? 

Let's make a guess that uses new letters? And tests R at position4? Or5? 

But R must be at either position4 or5? So we can include R at position4 in our guess? For example? 

Guess: GU? So GUARD? 

Alternatively? We can guess a word that contains R at position4? And tests new? Including U? But we don't know if U is in the word? 

Similarly? Another idea: include 'I'? Because we haven't tested I? 

But GUARD and ALARM? ALARM has L and M? 

But? Let's consider? 

We could guess ""BUILT""? But not pattern? Pattern requires A at3? 

To choose? Let's think strategy: we need to learn about position1 and position2? 

If we guess GUARD? Then:
- If U at2 is correct? Then mark ✓? Else? Etc? 

Similarly, ALARM? 

But? We can propose ALARM? Or GUARD? Both reasonable? 

I'll go with GUARD for now? Because we tested A? Duplicate? Less common? 

So? Guess: GUARD

But write: <guess>GUARD</guess>Based on the feedback from both guesses:

1. **Guess 1: ROAST → Feedback: R(-) O(x) A(✓) S(x) T(x)**  
   - A is confirmed in position 3 (secret word pattern: \_ \_ A \_ \_).  
   - R is in the word but not at position 1.  
   - O, S, T are not in the word.

2. **Guess 2: CRANE → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)**  
   - R is in the word but not at position 2.  
   - C, N, E are not in the word.  
   - Confirmed A still at position 3.

**Key deductions:**  
- The secret word pattern is \_ \_ A \_ \_.  
- R must be present but not at positions 1 or 2, so it must be at position 4 or 5.  
- Excluded letters: O, S, T, C, N, E.  
- Remaining vowels to test: I, U, and possibly Y (as it can function as a vowel).  
- Position 1 and 2 must be filled with new letters from the remaining alphabet (avoiding exclusions).  

**Strategy for this guess:**  
- Focus on words with R at position 4 or 5 to help locate R.  
- Test new common vowels (U or I) since only A has been confirmed so far.  
- Avoid excluded letters and reuse of confirmed positions where possible.  
- The word ""GUARD"" fits:  
  - Pattern: G U A R D → positions: 1=G, 2=U, 3=A (confirmed), 4=R, 5=D.  
  - Tests R at position 4 (could reveal if R is correctly placed at 4 or if it should be at 5).  
  - Tests U and D/G, filling gaps with new letters.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (O, S, T, C, N, E).  

If ""GUARD"" is incorrect, the feedback will help narrow R's position and reveal if U, G, or D are present.",Guess 3: GUARD -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) U(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
