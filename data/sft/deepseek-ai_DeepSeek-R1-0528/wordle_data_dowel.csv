First, I need to make my first guess for the 5-letter word game. Since I have no information yet, I should start with a word that has common letters to maximize the chances of getting useful feedback.

Common letters in English words: According to frequency analysis, letters like E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common. I should choose a word that includes several of these.

A good starting word in games like Wordle is often ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" because they cover frequent letters and have a good mix of vowels and consonants. Let me think of one.

Possible first guesses:
- ""CRANE"": Letters C, R, A, N, E. All are common.
- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – also good.
- ""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U – has more vowels, which might be useful since vowels are critical.

But in the example, the secret word was ""BRISK"", which starts with B, so I shouldn't assume anything.

Another popular one is ""ROATE"" – but I should use a real word.

Let me confirm: ""CRANE"" is a valid word, meaning a bird or a machine for lifting. ""SLATE"" is valid too.

I think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice because it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R), but C isn't super common; E, A, R, S are better.

Perhaps ""SOARE"" but that might be obscure. I think ""CRATE"" is another option.

Let's list the frequencies:
- E is most common, then A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

A word like ""RAISE"" or ""ARISE"" could be good.

""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – that includes R, A, I, S, E which are all top letters.

Similarly, ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"".

To cover different positions, I should choose a word where letters aren't repeating and are diverse.

For my first guess, I'll go with ""RAISE"". It has:
- R: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- I: common vowel
- S: common consonant
- E: common vowel

That seems balanced.

""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E; N is less common than S, so ""RAISE"" might be better.

""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – S and T are common.

But ""RAISE"" has I instead of L or T; I is a vowel, which might be useful.

I think ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are standard. Since this is the first guess, any reasonable word is fine.

I'll use ""RAISE"" as it covers multiple high-frequency letters.

So, my guess will be ""RAISE"".
</think>
For the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. Therefore, I should choose a word that maximizes the likelihood of getting useful feedback by including common English letters. According to letter frequency analysis, vowels like E, A, I, and O, as well as consonants like R, S, and T, are highly common in 5-letter words. A good starting word in Wordle-style games should incorporate several of these to test multiple positions simultaneously.  

The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:  
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).  
- Letters like E, A, R, I, and S are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English.  
- It has no repeating letters, ensuring broader coverage for feedback.  
- It's a valid English word, adhering to the game rules.  

This feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses. For example:  
- Correct positions (✓) will identify exact matches.  
- Misplaced positions (-) will indicate letters in the word but elsewhere.  
- Absent letters (x) can be eliminated.  

Let's proceed with ""RAISE"" as the first guess.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or S. But it does contain an E, but not in the last position (since in ""RAISE"", E is the 5th letter, and it's misplaced).

Therefore, the secret word has the letter E somewhere in positions 1 to 4, but not position 5.

Also, we know the word does not have R, A, I, S.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Includes E (because we know it's in the word, and we want to find its position)
- Does not include R, A, I, S (since they are absent)
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Since E is in the word but not at the end, it could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We should try a word that has E in a different position, and also introduces new common letters.

Common letters not yet tried: O, T, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can also consider that the word has 5 letters, one of which is E, and the other four are from the remaining alphabet excluding R, A, I, S.

Let's list the available letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to use common ones.

A good candidate might be a word that has E in the first position, for example, to test if E is at the start.

But it could be anywhere. We can try to cover multiple possibilities.

Another idea: use a word with E in the second position, and include other common consonants.

Possible words:

- ""TEPID"" - but we don't know if T, P, D are in the word.
- ""OUNCE"" - but E is at the end, and we know E is not at the end? Wait, no: the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E at the end again, it would be wrong, but we can do that to confirm? Actually, we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at the end, we expect it to be misplaced again? But that might not give new information about the position.

We should avoid putting E at position 5 because we already know it's not there. So we should try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let me think of words with E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then common letters.

Common words: ""EARTH"" but E is first, but we know A and R are not in the word, so we cannot use A or R.

We must avoid R, A, I, S.

So, for position 1: E, then we need other letters.

Possible: ""ELBOW"", ""ENDOW"", ""ENVOY"", ""EJECT"" - but let's think of common ones.

""ELOPE"" - but has O and P, and E at start and end? But we cannot have E at end? Actually, we can have the word contain E only once? Not necessarily, but in this case, we don't know.

The feedback only said E is in the word, but it might have multiple E's? But in ""RAISE"", there was one E, and it was misplaced. So the secret word has at least one E, and it's not at position 5.

But it could have E in multiple positions? We don't know.

To be safe, we should assume it might have only one E for now, but we can test.

But to maximize information, we should try a word with E in a new position and new letters.

Let me list some candidate words without R, A, I, S and with E not at position 5.

For example:
- E in position 1: words like ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""EXPEL"" (but X and P are less common), ""EVERY"" (but has R and Y, R is not allowed because we know R is absent).

We cannot use R, A, I, S.

So, ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W. All new letters? L, B, O, W are new.

Similarly, ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W.

""ENACT"": but has A, which is absent.

""EJECT"": E, J, E, C, T. But J is uncommon, and has two E's? The word is E-J-E-C-T, so positions: E at 1 and 3? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

It might be acceptable, but let's avoid uncommon letters.

Better to use more common letters.

Another idea: E in position 2. For example, ""LEMON"", but L, E, M, O, N. But E is at position 2.

But we don't know if L, M, O, N are in the word.

Similarly, ""BETEL"", ""DEVON"", etc.

But let's think of a word that uses common letters and has E in a position we haven't tested (i.e., not position 5).

In ""RAISE"", E was at position 5. Now we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I think position 1 or 2 might be good.

Also, we should include other vowels if possible, but we know A and I are out, so the only vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y. But E is already in, so we might have O or U.

Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let me try to form a word: How about ""TOUCH""? But no E, and we must include E because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to, but it would be wasteful not to use the information we have.

We know E is in the word, so we should include E in the new guess to find its position.

So, the guess must include E, and not include R, A, I, S.

Also, it should be a valid English word.

Let me think of words with E in position 1: 
- ""E"", then common: L, O, T, N, etc.
  ""ELOPE"": E, L, O, P, E. But E at the end again? We know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at the end, it will be misplaced again, which doesn't help us locate E. So better to avoid position 5 for E.

Therefore, for this guess, we should not put E at position 5.

So, E should be in positions 1,2,3, or 4, but not 5.

In ""ELOPE"", E is at 1 and 5. We can use it, but the E at 5 will be wrong, and we already know that, so it might be a waste of a letter.

Better to have E only once and in a new position.

So, let's avoid words with E at position 5.

Similarly, words with E only in positions 1-4.

For example:
- Position 1: ""ELBOW"", ""ENDOW"", ""EXPEL"" (but X is rare), ""EJECT"" (J is rare), ""EMPTY"" (M, P, T, Y)
- Position 2: ""LEMON"", ""BELOW"", ""DECOY"", ""FETID"", ""GEODE"" (uncommon)
- Position 3: ""OVATE"" (but O, V, A, T, E; A is absent, so invalid), ""INCUR"" (has I and R, absent), so need to avoid absent letters.
  ""OPTER"" (has R, absent), not good.
  ""BUTTE"" (B, U, T, T, E; E at end, which we avoid)
  ""CUBED"" (C, U, B, E, D; E at position 4) -> good, but we don't know about C, U, B, D.

Similarly, position 4: ""PLUME"" (P, L, U, M, E; E at end, avoid), ""CRUDE"" (C, R, U, D, E; R absent, and E at end).

It's tricky.

Let's list some candidate words:

1. ""ELBOW"": E (pos1), L, B, O, W. No E at end. Letters: E, L, B, O, W. All new and common enough.
2. ""ENDOW"": E (pos1), N, D, O, W. Similar.
3. ""BELOW"": B, E (pos2), L, O, W. E at position 2.
4. ""LEMON"": L, E (pos2), M, O, N.
5. ""CUBED"": C, U, B, E (pos4), D. E at position 4, which is new.
6. ""HOMED"": H, O, M, E (pos4), D. E at position 4.

Among these, ""BELOW"" seems good: B, E, L, O, W. Common letters, E at position 2.

""LEMON"" is also good: L, E, M, O, N.

But ""LEMON"" has M and N, which are common.

Another one: ""TOUPE"" - but E at end, avoid.

""POULE"" - obscure.

I think ""BELOW"" or ""LEMON"" are fine.

But we also want to cover more common letters. T is very common, so perhaps a word with T.

For example, ""BETEL"" but E at position 2 and 4? ""BETEL"": B, E, T, E, L. But two E's, and L. But we don't know if double E is possible.

""FETID"": F, E, T, I, D. But I is absent, so invalid.

Cannot use I.

""METRO"" but has R, absent.

""TEPID"" has I and is not allowed.

""DEUCE"": D, E, U, C, E. E at position 2 and 5. Position 5 is bad, so avoid.

""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T. E at position 4. V is less common.

Perhaps ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E. E at end, avoid.

""CHIME"" has I.

So, it's hard to avoid E at the end sometimes.

But we can use a word with E at position 3 or 4.

For example, ""OWLED"" - not common.

""BOXED"": B, O, X, E, D. E at position 4. X is uncommon.

""JOKED"" - J uncommon.

""LOBED"": L, O, B, E, D. E at position 4. Letters: L, O, B, E, D. All new and reasonable.

Similarly, ""LUBED"" - same.

""LOBED"" is a word? LOBED means having lobes, like in biology.

Similarly, ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D. E at position 4. T, O, N, D are common.

""TONED"" seems good: T, O, N, E, D. E at position 4.

We haven't tested T, O, N, D yet.

Similarly, ""CONED"" but C, O, N, E, D. Also good.

But ""TONED"" is more common.

Another one: ""HOPED"" has H, O, P, E, D. E at position 4.

But T is more common than H or P.

So ""TONED"" might be better.

But let's compare to ""BELOW"": ""BELOW"" has B, E, L, O, W. E at position 2.

""TONED"" has T, O, N, E, D. E at position 4.

Both introduce new common letters.

We know E is in the word, so by placing E in different positions, we can get information about its location.

In ""RAISE"", E was at position 5 and was misplaced. Now, if in the new guess, E is at position 2 (like in ""BELOW"") and if it's correct, we get a ✓, or if misplaced, we know it's not at 2.

Similarly for position 4 in ""TONED"".

Since we have no information, trying E in the middle might be good.

I think both are reasonable. I'll go with ""BELOW"" because it has E in position 2, which is a common position for E, and it uses B, L, O, W which are good.

""BELOW"" is a common word.

Another popular choice might be ""CLONE"" but has C, L, O, N, E. E at end, which we want to avoid. So not good.

""MODEL"" has E at position 4? M, O, D, E, L. E at position 4. But L is included.

""MODEL"" is good: M, O, D, E, L. E at position 4.

But ""BELOW"" has W, which is less common than T or N.

Perhaps ""TENOR"" but has R and N, R is absent.

No.

""BONEY"" - not common.

I think ""BELOW"" is acceptable.

To include T, how about ""BETTY"" but has double T and Y, and no E? Not.

""THEFT"" has E at position 3: T, H, E, F, T. But double T, and F and H are less common.

Not ideal.

""DEALT"" has A and E, but A is absent.

So, I think ""BELOW"" or ""TONED"".

Let's choose ""TONED"" because T, O, N, D are very common, and E is at position 4, which is a position we haven't tested (in the first guess, E was at 5, now at 4).

In ""RAISE"", E was at 5, so testing position 4 is adjacent and might be likely.

But no strong reason.

I'll go with ""TONED"".

But ""TONED"" has E at position 4. If the secret word has E at position 4, we get a ✓ for E. If not, we get - or x, but we know E is in the word, so if not at 4, it would be misplaced, telling us it's not at 4.

Similarly for other positions.

Another candidate: ""OUNCE"" has E at end, avoid.

""ELUDE"": E at 1, L, U, D, E. E at end again, so avoid.

""EXILE"" has I and X, not good.

So, ""TONED"" seems solid.

But let's confirm: T, O, N, E, D. All letters not excluded, and E at position 4.

Yes.

We could do ""NOTED"", which is similar: N, O, T, E, D. E at position 4. Same letters.

""NOTED"" is more common than ""TONED""? Both are valid.

I'll use ""NOTED"" for familiarity.

""NOTED"": N, O, T, E, D.

So, second guess: ""NOTED"".

But we must not use R, A, I, S, which we aren't.

So, I think that's good.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, S are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- E is present but misplaced (-), meaning it is in the secret word but not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include E (since it is confirmed in the secret word) but not in position 5 (as it was misplaced there in ""RAISE"").
- It must avoid R, A, I, S entirely.
- To maximize information, use common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, O, N, D) and place E in a new position (1–4) to narrow down its location.

A strong candidate is ""NOTED"":
- It includes E in position 4 (a new position to test).
- It introduces new common letters: T, O, N, D.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help:
- Confirm if E is in position 4 (✓), or if misplaced (-), reveal another possible position.
- Test T, O, N, D for presence/position.

<guess>NOTED</guess>",NOTED,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or S. But it does contain an E, but not in the last position (since in ""RAISE"", E is the 5th letter, and it's misplaced).

Therefore, the secret word has the letter E somewhere in positions 1 to 4, but not position 5.

Also, we know the word does not have R, A, I, S.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Includes E (because we know it's in the word, and we want to find its position)
- Does not include R, A, I, S (since they are absent)
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Since E is in the word but not at the end, it could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We should try a word that has E in a different position, and also introduces new common letters.

Common letters not yet tried: O, T, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can also consider that the word has 5 letters, one of which is E, and the other four are from the remaining alphabet excluding R, A, I, S.

Let's list the available letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to use common ones.

A good candidate might be a word that has E in the first position, for example, to test if E is at the start.

But it could be anywhere. We can try to cover multiple possibilities.

Another idea: use a word with E in the second position, and include other common consonants.

Possible words:

- ""TEPID"" - but we don't know if T, P, D are in the word.
- ""OUNCE"" - but E is at the end, and we know E is not at the end? Wait, no: the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E at the end again, it would be wrong, but we can do that to confirm? Actually, we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at the end, we expect it to be misplaced again? But that might not give new information about the position.

We should avoid putting E at position 5 because we already know it's not there. So we should try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let me think of words with E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then common letters.

Common words: ""EARTH"" but E is first, but we know A and R are not in the word, so we cannot use A or R.

We must avoid R, A, I, S.

So, for position 1: E, then we need other letters.

Possible: ""ELBOW"", ""ENDOW"", ""ENVOY"", ""EJECT"" - but let's think of common ones.

""ELOPE"" - but has O and P, and E at start and end? But we cannot have E at end? Actually, we can have the word contain E only once? Not necessarily, but in this case, we don't know.

The feedback only said E is in the word, but it might have multiple E's? But in ""RAISE"", there was one E, and it was misplaced. So the secret word has at least one E, and it's not at position 5.

But it could have E in multiple positions? We don't know.

To be safe, we should assume it might have only one E for now, but we can test.

But to maximize information, we should try a word with E in a new position and new letters.

Let me list some candidate words without R, A, I, S and with E not at position 5.

For example:
- E in position 1: words like ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""EXPEL"" (but X and P are less common), ""EVERY"" (but has R and Y, R is not allowed because we know R is absent).

We cannot use R, A, I, S.

So, ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W. All new letters? L, B, O, W are new.

Similarly, ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W.

""ENACT"": but has A, which is absent.

""EJECT"": E, J, E, C, T. But J is uncommon, and has two E's? The word is E-J-E-C-T, so positions: E at 1 and 3? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

It might be acceptable, but let's avoid uncommon letters.

Better to use more common letters.

Another idea: E in position 2. For example, ""LEMON"", but L, E, M, O, N. But E is at position 2.

But we don't know if L, M, O, N are in the word.

Similarly, ""BETEL"", ""DEVON"", etc.

But let's think of a word that uses common letters and has E in a position we haven't tested (i.e., not position 5).

In ""RAISE"", E was at position 5. Now we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I think position 1 or 2 might be good.

Also, we should include other vowels if possible, but we know A and I are out, so the only vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y. But E is already in, so we might have O or U.

Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let me try to form a word: How about ""TOUCH""? But no E, and we must include E because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to, but it would be wasteful not to use the information we have.

We know E is in the word, so we should include E in the new guess to find its position.

So, the guess must include E, and not include R, A, I, S.

Also, it should be a valid English word.

Let me think of words with E in position 1: 
- ""E"", then common: L, O, T, N, etc.
  ""ELOPE"": E, L, O, P, E. But E at the end again? We know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at the end, it will be misplaced again, which doesn't help us locate E. So better to avoid position 5 for E.

Therefore, for this guess, we should not put E at position 5.

So, E should be in positions 1,2,3, or 4, but not 5.

In ""ELOPE"", E is at 1 and 5. We can use it, but the E at 5 will be wrong, and we already know that, so it might be a waste of a letter.

Better to have E only once and in a new position.

So, let's avoid words with E at position 5.

Similarly, words with E only in positions 1-4.

For example:
- Position 1: ""ELBOW"", ""ENDOW"", ""EXPEL"" (but X is rare), ""EJECT"" (J is rare), ""EMPTY"" (M, P, T, Y)
- Position 2: ""LEMON"", ""BELOW"", ""DECOY"", ""FETID"", ""GEODE"" (uncommon)
- Position 3: ""OVATE"" (but O, V, A, T, E; A is absent, so invalid), ""INCUR"" (has I and R, absent), so need to avoid absent letters.
  ""OPTER"" (has R, absent), not good.
  ""BUTTE"" (B, U, T, T, E; E at end, which we avoid)
  ""CUBED"" (C, U, B, E, D; E at position 4) -> good, but we don't know about C, U, B, D.

Similarly, position 4: ""PLUME"" (P, L, U, M, E; E at end, avoid), ""CRUDE"" (C, R, U, D, E; R absent, and E at end).

It's tricky.

Let's list some candidate words:

1. ""ELBOW"": E (pos1), L, B, O, W. No E at end. Letters: E, L, B, O, W. All new and common enough.
2. ""ENDOW"": E (pos1), N, D, O, W. Similar.
3. ""BELOW"": B, E (pos2), L, O, W. E at position 2.
4. ""LEMON"": L, E (pos2), M, O, N.
5. ""CUBED"": C, U, B, E (pos4), D. E at position 4, which is new.
6. ""HOMED"": H, O, M, E (pos4), D. E at position 4.

Among these, ""BELOW"" seems good: B, E, L, O, W. Common letters, E at position 2.

""LEMON"" is also good: L, E, M, O, N.

But ""LEMON"" has M and N, which are common.

Another one: ""TOUPE"" - but E at end, avoid.

""POULE"" - obscure.

I think ""BELOW"" or ""LEMON"" are fine.

But we also want to cover more common letters. T is very common, so perhaps a word with T.

For example, ""BETEL"" but E at position 2 and 4? ""BETEL"": B, E, T, E, L. But two E's, and L. But we don't know if double E is possible.

""FETID"": F, E, T, I, D. But I is absent, so invalid.

Cannot use I.

""METRO"" but has R, absent.

""TEPID"" has I and is not allowed.

""DEUCE"": D, E, U, C, E. E at position 2 and 5. Position 5 is bad, so avoid.

""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T. E at position 4. V is less common.

Perhaps ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E. E at end, avoid.

""CHIME"" has I.

So, it's hard to avoid E at the end sometimes.

But we can use a word with E at position 3 or 4.

For example, ""OWLED"" - not common.

""BOXED"": B, O, X, E, D. E at position 4. X is uncommon.

""JOKED"" - J uncommon.

""LOBED"": L, O, B, E, D. E at position 4. Letters: L, O, B, E, D. All new and reasonable.

Similarly, ""LUBED"" - same.

""LOBED"" is a word? LOBED means having lobes, like in biology.

Similarly, ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D. E at position 4. T, O, N, D are common.

""TONED"" seems good: T, O, N, E, D. E at position 4.

We haven't tested T, O, N, D yet.

Similarly, ""CONED"" but C, O, N, E, D. Also good.

But ""TONED"" is more common.

Another one: ""HOPED"" has H, O, P, E, D. E at position 4.

But T is more common than H or P.

So ""TONED"" might be better.

But let's compare to ""BELOW"": ""BELOW"" has B, E, L, O, W. E at position 2.

""TONED"" has T, O, N, E, D. E at position 4.

Both introduce new common letters.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make my first guess for the 5-letter word game. Since I have no information yet, I should start with a word that has common letters to maximize the chances of getting useful feedback.

Common letters in English words: According to frequency analysis, letters like E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common. I should choose a word that includes several of these.

A good starting word in games like Wordle is often ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" because they cover frequent letters and have a good mix of vowels and consonants. Let me think of one.

Possible first guesses:
- ""CRANE"": Letters C, R, A, N, E. All are common.
- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – also good.
- ""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U – has more vowels, which might be useful since vowels are critical.

But in the example, the secret word was ""BRISK"", which starts with B, so I shouldn't assume anything.

Another popular one is ""ROATE"" – but I should use a real word.

Let me confirm: ""CRANE"" is a valid word, meaning a bird or a machine for lifting. ""SLATE"" is valid too.

I think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice because it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R), but C isn't super common; E, A, R, S are better.

Perhaps ""SOARE"" but that might be obscure. I think ""CRATE"" is another option.

Let's list the frequencies:
- E is most common, then A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

A word like ""RAISE"" or ""ARISE"" could be good.

""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – that includes R, A, I, S, E which are all top letters.

Similarly, ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"".

To cover different positions, I should choose a word where letters aren't repeating and are diverse.

For my first guess, I'll go with ""RAISE"". It has:
- R: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- I: common vowel
- S: common consonant
- E: common vowel

That seems balanced.

""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E; N is less common than S, so ""RAISE"" might be better.

""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – S and T are common.

But ""RAISE"" has I instead of L or T; I is a vowel, which might be useful.

I think ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are standard. Since this is the first guess, any reasonable word is fine.

I'll use ""RAISE"" as it covers multiple high-frequency letters.

So, my guess will be ""RAISE"".For the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. Therefore, I should choose a word that maximizes the likelihood of getting useful feedback by including common English letters. According to letter frequency analysis, vowels like E, A, I, and O, as well as consonants like R, S, and T, are highly common in 5-letter words. A good starting word in Wordle-style games should incorporate several of these to test multiple positions simultaneously.  

The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:  
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).  
- Letters like E, A, R, I, and S are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English.  
- It has no repeating letters, ensuring broader coverage for feedback.  
- It's a valid English word, adhering to the game rules.  

This feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses. For example:  
- Correct positions (✓) will identify exact matches.  
- Misplaced positions (-) will indicate letters in the word but elsewhere.  
- Absent letters (x) can be eliminated.  

Let's proceed with ""RAISE"" as the first guess.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or S. But it does contain an E, but not in the last position (since in ""RAISE"", E is the 5th letter, and it's misplaced).

Therefore, the secret word has the letter E somewhere in positions 1 to 4, but not position 5.

Also, we know the word does not have R, A, I, S.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Includes E (because we know it's in the word, and we want to find its position)
- Does not include R, A, I, S (since they are absent)
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Since E is in the word but not at the end, it could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We should try a word that has E in a different position, and also introduces new common letters.

Common letters not yet tried: O, T, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can also consider that the word has 5 letters, one of which is E, and the other four are from the remaining alphabet excluding R, A, I, S.

Let's list the available letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to use common ones.

A good candidate might be a word that has E in the first position, for example, to test if E is at the start.

But it could be anywhere. We can try to cover multiple possibilities.

Another idea: use a word with E in the second position, and include other common consonants.

Possible words:

- ""TEPID"" - but we don't know if T, P, D are in the word.
- ""OUNCE"" - but E is at the end, and we know E is not at the end? Wait, no: the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E at the end again, it would be wrong, but we can do that to confirm? Actually, we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at the end, we expect it to be misplaced again? But that might not give new information about the position.

We should avoid putting E at position 5 because we already know it's not there. So we should try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let me think of words with E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then common letters.

Common words: ""EARTH"" but E is first, but we know A and R are not in the word, so we cannot use A or R.

We must avoid R, A, I, S.

So, for position 1: E, then we need other letters.

Possible: ""ELBOW"", ""ENDOW"", ""ENVOY"", ""EJECT"" - but let's think of common ones.

""ELOPE"" - but has O and P, and E at start and end? But we cannot have E at end? Actually, we can have the word contain E only once? Not necessarily, but in this case, we don't know.

The feedback only said E is in the word, but it might have multiple E's? But in ""RAISE"", there was one E, and it was misplaced. So the secret word has at least one E, and it's not at position 5.

But it could have E in multiple positions? We don't know.

To be safe, we should assume it might have only one E for now, but we can test.

But to maximize information, we should try a word with E in a new position and new letters.

Let me list some candidate words without R, A, I, S and with E not at position 5.

For example:
- E in position 1: words like ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""EXPEL"" (but X and P are less common), ""EVERY"" (but has R and Y, R is not allowed because we know R is absent).

We cannot use R, A, I, S.

So, ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W. All new letters? L, B, O, W are new.

Similarly, ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W.

""ENACT"": but has A, which is absent.

""EJECT"": E, J, E, C, T. But J is uncommon, and has two E's? The word is E-J-E-C-T, so positions: E at 1 and 3? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

It might be acceptable, but let's avoid uncommon letters.

Better to use more common letters.

Another idea: E in position 2. For example, ""LEMON"", but L, E, M, O, N. But E is at position 2.

But we don't know if L, M, O, N are in the word.

Similarly, ""BETEL"", ""DEVON"", etc.

But let's think of a word that uses common letters and has E in a position we haven't tested (i.e., not position 5).

In ""RAISE"", E was at position 5. Now we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I think position 1 or 2 might be good.

Also, we should include other vowels if possible, but we know A and I are out, so the only vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y. But E is already in, so we might have O or U.

Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let me try to form a word: How about ""TOUCH""? But no E, and we must include E because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to, but it would be wasteful not to use the information we have.

We know E is in the word, so we should include E in the new guess to find its position.

So, the guess must include E, and not include R, A, I, S.

Also, it should be a valid English word.

Let me think of words with E in position 1: 
- ""E"", then common: L, O, T, N, etc.
  ""ELOPE"": E, L, O, P, E. But E at the end again? We know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at the end, it will be misplaced again, which doesn't help us locate E. So better to avoid position 5 for E.

Therefore, for this guess, we should not put E at position 5.

So, E should be in positions 1,2,3, or 4, but not 5.

In ""ELOPE"", E is at 1 and 5. We can use it, but the E at 5 will be wrong, and we already know that, so it might be a waste of a letter.

Better to have E only once and in a new position.

So, let's avoid words with E at position 5.

Similarly, words with E only in positions 1-4.

For example:
- Position 1: ""ELBOW"", ""ENDOW"", ""EXPEL"" (but X is rare), ""EJECT"" (J is rare), ""EMPTY"" (M, P, T, Y)
- Position 2: ""LEMON"", ""BELOW"", ""DECOY"", ""FETID"", ""GEODE"" (uncommon)
- Position 3: ""OVATE"" (but O, V, A, T, E; A is absent, so invalid), ""INCUR"" (has I and R, absent), so need to avoid absent letters.
  ""OPTER"" (has R, absent), not good.
  ""BUTTE"" (B, U, T, T, E; E at end, which we avoid)
  ""CUBED"" (C, U, B, E, D; E at position 4) -> good, but we don't know about C, U, B, D.

Similarly, position 4: ""PLUME"" (P, L, U, M, E; E at end, avoid), ""CRUDE"" (C, R, U, D, E; R absent, and E at end).

It's tricky.

Let's list some candidate words:

1. ""ELBOW"": E (pos1), L, B, O, W. No E at end. Letters: E, L, B, O, W. All new and common enough.
2. ""ENDOW"": E (pos1), N, D, O, W. Similar.
3. ""BELOW"": B, E (pos2), L, O, W. E at position 2.
4. ""LEMON"": L, E (pos2), M, O, N.
5. ""CUBED"": C, U, B, E (pos4), D. E at position 4, which is new.
6. ""HOMED"": H, O, M, E (pos4), D. E at position 4.

Among these, ""BELOW"" seems good: B, E, L, O, W. Common letters, E at position 2.

""LEMON"" is also good: L, E, M, O, N.

But ""LEMON"" has M and N, which are common.

Another one: ""TOUPE"" - but E at end, avoid.

""POULE"" - obscure.

I think ""BELOW"" or ""LEMON"" are fine.

But we also want to cover more common letters. T is very common, so perhaps a word with T.

For example, ""BETEL"" but E at position 2 and 4? ""BETEL"": B, E, T, E, L. But two E's, and L. But we don't know if double E is possible.

""FETID"": F, E, T, I, D. But I is absent, so invalid.

Cannot use I.

""METRO"" but has R, absent.

""TEPID"" has I and is not allowed.

""DEUCE"": D, E, U, C, E. E at position 2 and 5. Position 5 is bad, so avoid.

""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T. E at position 4. V is less common.

Perhaps ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E. E at end, avoid.

""CHIME"" has I.

So, it's hard to avoid E at the end sometimes.

But we can use a word with E at position 3 or 4.

For example, ""OWLED"" - not common.

""BOXED"": B, O, X, E, D. E at position 4. X is uncommon.

""JOKED"" - J uncommon.

""LOBED"": L, O, B, E, D. E at position 4. Letters: L, O, B, E, D. All new and reasonable.

Similarly, ""LUBED"" - same.

""LOBED"" is a word? LOBED means having lobes, like in biology.

Similarly, ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D. E at position 4. T, O, N, D are common.

""TONED"" seems good: T, O, N, E, D. E at position 4.

We haven't tested T, O, N, D yet.

Similarly, ""CONED"" but C, O, N, E, D. Also good.

But ""TONED"" is more common.

Another one: ""HOPED"" has H, O, P, E, D. E at position 4.

But T is more common than H or P.

So ""TONED"" might be better.

But let's compare to ""BELOW"": ""BELOW"" has B, E, L, O, W. E at position 2.

""TONED"" has T, O, N, E, D. E at position 4.

Both introduce new common letters.

We know E is in the word, so by placing E in different positions, we can get information about its location.

In ""RAISE"", E was at position 5 and was misplaced. Now, if in the new guess, E is at position 2 (like in ""BELOW"") and if it's correct, we get a ✓, or if misplaced, we know it's not at 2.

Similarly for position 4 in ""TONED"".

Since we have no information, trying E in the middle might be good.

I think both are reasonable. I'll go with ""BELOW"" because it has E in position 2, which is a common position for E, and it uses B, L, O, W which are good.

""BELOW"" is a common word.

Another popular choice might be ""CLONE"" but has C, L, O, N, E. E at end, which we want to avoid. So not good.

""MODEL"" has E at position 4? M, O, D, E, L. E at position 4. But L is included.

""MODEL"" is good: M, O, D, E, L. E at position 4.

But ""BELOW"" has W, which is less common than T or N.

Perhaps ""TENOR"" but has R and N, R is absent.

No.

""BONEY"" - not common.

I think ""BELOW"" is acceptable.

To include T, how about ""BETTY"" but has double T and Y, and no E? Not.

""THEFT"" has E at position 3: T, H, E, F, T. But double T, and F and H are less common.

Not ideal.

""DEALT"" has A and E, but A is absent.

So, I think ""BELOW"" or ""TONED"".

Let's choose ""TONED"" because T, O, N, D are very common, and E is at position 4, which is a position we haven't tested (in the first guess, E was at 5, now at 4).

In ""RAISE"", E was at 5, so testing position 4 is adjacent and might be likely.

But no strong reason.

I'll go with ""TONED"".

But ""TONED"" has E at position 4. If the secret word has E at position 4, we get a ✓ for E. If not, we get - or x, but we know E is in the word, so if not at 4, it would be misplaced, telling us it's not at 4.

Similarly for other positions.

Another candidate: ""OUNCE"" has E at end, avoid.

""ELUDE"": E at 1, L, U, D, E. E at end again, so avoid.

""EXILE"" has I and X, not good.

So, ""TONED"" seems solid.

But let's confirm: T, O, N, E, D. All letters not excluded, and E at position 4.

Yes.

We could do ""NOTED"", which is similar: N, O, T, E, D. E at position 4. Same letters.

""NOTED"" is more common than ""TONED""? Both are valid.

I'll use ""NOTED"" for familiarity.

""NOTED"": N, O, T, E, D.

So, second guess: ""NOTED"".

But we must not use R, A, I, S, which we aren't.

So, I think that's good.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, S are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- E is present but misplaced (-), meaning it is in the secret word but not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include E (since it is confirmed in the secret word) but not in position 5 (as it was misplaced there in ""RAISE"").
- It must avoid R, A, I, S entirely.
- To maximize information, use common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, O, N, D) and place E in a new position (1–4) to narrow down its location.

A strong candidate is ""NOTED"":
- It includes E in position 4 (a new position to test).
- It introduces new common letters: T, O, N, D.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help:
- Confirm if E is in position 4 (✓), or if misplaced (-), reveal another possible position.
- Test T, O, N, D for presence/position.

I should choose a word that includes several of these.\n\nA good starting word in games like Wordle is often ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" because they cover frequent letters and have a good mix of vowels and consonants. Let me think of one.\n\nPossible first guesses:\n- ""CRANE"": Letters C, R, A, N, E. All are common.\n- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – also good.\n- ""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U – has more vowels, which might be useful since vowels are critical.\n\nBut in the example, the secret word was ""BRISK"", which starts with B, so I shouldn\'t assume anything.\n\nAnother popular one is ""ROATE"" – but I should use a real word.\n\nLet me confirm: ""CRANE"" is a valid word, meaning a bird or a machine for lifting. ""SLATE"" is valid too.\n\nI think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice because it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R), but C isn\'t super common; E, A, R, S are better.\n\nPerhaps ""SOARE"" but that might be obscure. I think ""CRATE"" is another option.\n\nLet\'s list the frequencies:\n- E is most common, then A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.\n\nA word like ""RAISE"" or ""ARISE"" could be good.\n\n""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – that includes R, A, I, S, E which are all top letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"".\n\nTo cover different positions, I should choose a word where letters aren\'t repeating and are diverse.\n\nFor my first guess, I\'ll go with ""RAISE"".

Since this is the first guess, any reasonable word is fine.\n\nI\'ll use ""RAISE"" as it covers multiple high-frequency letters.\n\nSo, my guess will be ""RAISE"".For the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. Therefore, I should choose a word that maximizes the likelihood of getting useful feedback by including common English letters. According to letter frequency analysis, vowels like E, A, I, and O, as well as consonants like R, S, and T, are highly common in 5-letter words. A good starting word in Wordle-style games should incorporate several of these to test multiple positions simultaneously.  \n\nThe word ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:  \n- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).  \n- Letters like E, A, R, I, and S are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English.  \n- It has no repeating letters, ensuring broader coverage for feedback.  \n- It\'s a valid English word, adhering to the game rules.  \n\nThis feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses. For example:  \n- Correct positions (✓) will identify exact matches.  \n- Misplaced positions (-) will indicate letters in the word but elsewhere.  \n- Absent letters (x) can be eliminated.  \n\nLet\'s proceed with ""RAISE"" as the first guess.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or S.

Wait, no: the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E at the end again, it would be wrong, but we can do that to confirm? Actually, we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at the end, we expect it to be misplaced again? But that might not give new information about the position.\n\nWe should avoid putting E at position 5 because we already know it\'s not there. So we should try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nLet me think of words with E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then common letters.\n\nCommon words: ""EARTH"" but E is first, but we know A and R are not in the word, so we cannot use A or R.\n\nWe must avoid R, A, I, S.\n\nSo, for position 1: E, then we need other letters.\n\nPossible: ""ELBOW"", ""ENDOW"", ""ENVOY"", ""EJECT"" - but let\'s think of common ones.\n\n""ELOPE"" - but has O and P, and E at start and end? But we cannot have E at end? Actually, we can have the word contain E only once? Not necessarily, but in this case, we don\'t know.\n\nThe feedback only said E is in the word, but it might have multiple E\'s? But in ""RAISE"", there was one E, and it was misplaced. So the secret word has at least one E, and it\'s not at position 5.\n\nBut it could have E in multiple positions? We don\'t know.\n\nTo be safe, we should assume it might have only one E for now, but we can test.\n\nBut to maximize information, we should try a word with E in a new position and new letters.\n\nLet me list some candidate words without R, A, I, S and with E not at position 5.\n\nFor example:\n- E in position 1: words like ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""EXPEL"" (but X and P are less common), ""EVERY"" (but has R and Y, R is not allowed because we know R is absent).\n\nWe cannot use R, A, I, S.\n\nSo, ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W. All new letters? L, B, O, W are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W.\n\n""ENACT"": but has A, which is absent.\n\n""EJECT"": E, J, E, C, T. But J is uncommon, and has two E\'s? The word is E-J-E-C-T, so positions: E at 1 and 3? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\nIt might be acceptable, but let\'s avoid uncommon letters.\n\nBetter to use more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: E in position 2. For example, ""LEMON"", but L, E, M, O, N. But E is at position 2.\n\nBut we don\'t know if L, M, O, N are in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""BETEL"", ""DEVON"", etc.\n\nBut let\'s think of a word that uses common letters and has E in a position we haven\'t tested (i.e., not position 5).\n\nIn ""RAISE"", E was at position 5.

We can use it, but the E at 5 will be wrong, and we already know that, so it might be a waste of a letter.\n\nBetter to have E only once and in a new position.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid words with E at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, words with E only in positions 1-4.\n\nFor example:\n- Position 1: ""ELBOW"", ""ENDOW"", ""EXPEL"" (but X is rare), ""EJECT"" (J is rare), ""EMPTY"" (M, P, T, Y)\n- Position 2: ""LEMON"", ""BELOW"", ""DECOY"", ""FETID"", ""GEODE"" (uncommon)\n- Position 3: ""OVATE"" (but O, V, A, T, E; A is absent, so invalid), ""INCUR"" (has I and R, absent), so need to avoid absent letters.\n  ""OPTER"" (has R, absent), not good.\n  ""BUTTE"" (B, U, T, T, E; E at end, which we avoid)\n  ""CUBED"" (C, U, B, E, D; E at position 4) -> good, but we don\'t know about C, U, B, D.\n\nSimilarly, position 4: ""PLUME"" (P, L, U, M, E; E at end, avoid), ""CRUDE"" (C, R, U, D, E; R absent, and E at end).\n\nIt\'s tricky.\n\nLet\'s list some candidate words:\n\n1.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: absent (x)
- A: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: present but misplaced (-)

Guess 2: NOTED
- N: absent (x)
- O: correct position (✓) at position 2 (since O is the second letter in ""NOTED"")
- T: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 4 (since E is the fourth letter in ""NOTED"")
- D: present but misplaced (-)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word contains the letter O in the second position (position 2).
2. The secret word contains the letter E in the fourth position (position 4).
3. The secret word contains the letter D, but not in the fifth position (since in ""NOTED"", D was at position 5 and is misplaced).
4. The following letters are absent: R, A, I, S, N, T. So we can exclude these.

Also, from the first guess, we know E is present but not in position 5, and now we know it is in position 4.

The secret word has the form: _ O _ E _

We also know D is in the word but not at position 5. So D must be in one of the first three positions? But positions 2 and 4 are taken by O and E, so D must be in position 1 or 3.

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Position 2: O (fixed)
Position 4: E (fixed)
Position 5: cannot be D (since D was misplaced at position 5 in ""NOTED""), and also, we know from the first guess that E was not at position 5, which is consistent.

So D must be at position 1 or 3.

Additionally, we have no information about other letters.

We need to find a word that fits: _ O _ E _

With D in position 1 or 3, and the missing letters must not be R, A, I, S, N, T.

Also, we have used: R, A, I, S, E, N, O, T, D. So available letters are the rest of the alphabet.

Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need common letters.

Now, the word must have D in it, at position 1 or 3.

Case 1: D at position 1 -> D O _ E _
Case 2: D at position 3 -> _ O D E _

We need to fill the blanks with letters not excluded.

Also, since D is misplaced at position 5, it must be in the word but not at 5, which is satisfied as long as it's at 1 or 3.

Now, let's think of possible words.

First, if D is at position 1: ""DO _ E _""

Possible words: DOZEN, DOGES, DOGMA, etc.

But DOZEN: Z is not very common, and we have N excluded? N is absent, so cannot use N. DOZEN has N, which is excluded.

Similarly, DOGES: G, E, S. But S is excluded, so no.

DOGMA: G, M, A. A is excluded.

DOWSE: W, S, E. S excluded.

DOPEY: P, E, Y. But E is already at position 4, and Y is possible. But ""DOPEY"" has E at position 4? D O P E Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:P, 4:E, 5:Y. But we have E at position 4, which is correct, and O at 2 correct. D is at position 1, which is new. But we need to check if D is allowed at position 1? The feedback said D is misplaced at position 5, but it can be at position 1. However, in ""DOPEY"", the fifth letter is Y, not D, so that's fine. But we must not use excluded letters. Excluded: R,A,I,S,N,T. So P and Y are allowed.

But is ""DOPEY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning sleepy or dazed.

But let's see if it fits: secret word has O at 2, E at 4, and D must be present. In ""DOPEY"", D is at 1, so it should be present. But the feedback for D in guess 2 was misplaced, meaning D is in the word but not at position 5. In ""DOPEY"", D is at 1, so it's fine.

But we have to make sure about the other letters.

In ""DOPEY"", we have P at position 3 and Y at position 5.

Now, second case: D at position 3: _ O D E _

Possible words: BODED, BODES, CODED, CODEC, CODER, CODES, GODET, HODAD, JODEL, LODEN, LODES, MODEM, MODER, MODES, NODES, RODEO, RODES, WODGE, YODEL, etc.

But we have exclusions: R,A,I,S,N,T are absent. So we cannot have words with these.

For example, BODED: B, O, D, E, D. But D repeated? And E at 4. But N is not in it? BODED has B, O, D, E, D. Letters: B, O, D, E. D repeated? The word is B-O-D-E-D, so positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:D. But we have D at position 3 and 5. But in our feedback, D is present, but we don't know if it can be repeated. However, in the first guess, we had no repeated letters, but the secret word might have duplicates.

But in the feedback for ""NOTED"", D was at position 5 and was misplaced, meaning that at least one D is in the word, but not at position 5. If the word has two D's, it could have one at position 5, but the feedback says D is misplaced at position 5, which would imply that D is not at position 5, even if there are multiple. So position 5 cannot be D. Therefore, in ""BODED"", position 5 is D, which would be incorrect, but the word has D at position 3 as well. However, the feedback for ""NOTED"" said D is present but not at position 5, so if we guess a word with D at position 5, it would be marked as misplaced if there is another D, or absent if no other D? But in standard Wordle, if a letter is in the word multiple times, the feedback can be tricky.

To avoid complexity, let's assume for now that the secret word has only one D, since we have no evidence of duplicates. But it might have.

But in ""BODED"", if we guess it, and the secret word has only one D, then position 5 D would be absent if D is at position 3, but we know D is in the word, so it might be marked as misplaced if the position is wrong, but since position 5 is not correct, and D is present elsewhere, it would be marked as misplaced for position 5? I think I need to recall the rules.

Standard Wordle feedback: for each position, if the letter is correct, green; if the letter is in the word but in wrong position, yellow; if not in word, gray. If there are multiple, it can be yellow for one and gray for another if the count is exceeded.

But in this case, for ""NOTED"", D at position 5 was yellow, meaning D is in the word but not at position 5. So the secret word has at least one D, and position 5 is not D.

If the secret word has only one D, then in a guess, if we put D at position 5, it should be yellow only if there is another D? No, if we put D at position 5 and the secret word has D only at, say, position 1, then position 5 D should be yellow (since D is in the word but not here). But if the secret word has no D at all, it would be gray. But we know D is in the word, so if we put D at position 5, it should be yellow, because D is present but not at position 5.

Similarly, if we put D at a position where it is not, but D is in the word, it should be yellow.

Back to the point.

For the secret word, we have positions 2 and 4 fixed: O and E.

Position 1 and 3 and 5 to fill, with D in position 1 or 3.

Also, position 5 cannot be D.

Now, from the list, with exclusions.

First, D at position 1: ""DO _ E _""

Possible words: DOGES, but S excluded.

DOGMA, A excluded.

DOWSE, S excluded.

DOPEY: D O P E Y. P and Y are allowed. And no excluded letters. So ""DOPEY"" is a candidate.

Other: DOVEN? Not common.

DOZED, but Z and D repeated? DOZED: D O Z E D. D at 1 and 5. But position 5 is D, which we know cannot be D because in ""NOTED"" D at 5 was misplaced, so position 5 is not D. Therefore, ""DOZED"" would have D at 5, which is invalid for the secret word. So not.

Similarly, ""DOPEY"" has Y at 5, not D.

Now, D at position 3: "" _ O D E _""

Possible words: BODED, but has D at 5, which is invalid.

BODES: B O D E S, but S excluded.

CODES: C O D E S, S excluded.

MODES: M O D E S, S excluded.

RODEO: R O D E O, but R excluded, and O repeated? R O D E O, positions: 1:R (excluded), 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:O. O is at position 2 and 5, but we have O at position 2 fixed, so position 5 could be O? But in this word, it has two O's. But R is excluded, so invalid.

YODEL: Y O D E L. Letters: Y, O, D, E, L. O at 2, E at 4. D at 3. Position 5 is L. No excluded letters. So ""YODEL"" is a candidate.

Similarly, WODGE: W O D G E, but E is at position 5? W O D G E -> positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. But we have E at position 4 fixed, but here E is at 5, so not matching. Secret word has E at position 4, so position 4 must be E. In ""WODGE"", position 4 is G, not E, so it doesn't fit the pattern.

We need position 4 to be E.

Similarly, MODEM: M O D E M. Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:M. So this fits: _ O D E _ with M at 1 and 5. And no excluded letters. M is allowed.

Similarly, CODEC: C O D E C. C at 1 and 5.

But CODEC might be considered a tech word, but it's valid.

HODAD: H O D A D, but A excluded.

JODEL: similar to YODEL, but J is less common.

LODEN: L O D E N, but N excluded.

So possible candidates: 
- D at 1: ""DOPEY"" (D O P E Y)
- D at 3: ""YODEL"" (Y O D E L) or ""MODEM"" (M O D E M) or ""CODEC"" (C O D E C)

We need to choose one for the guess.

We also have to consider that in ""DOPEY"", D is at position 1, and in ""YODEL"", D is at position 3. We don't know which is correct, so we need to test.

Moreover, we have other positions to fill.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that tests letters we haven't used.

We have used: R,A,I,S,E,N,O,T,D. So available: B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

In the candidates:
- ""DOPEY"": uses P and Y
- ""YODEL"": uses Y, D, E, L (but D and E are known, so new are Y and L)
- ""MODEM"": uses M and M (repeated)
- ""CODEC"": uses C and C (repeated)

""MODEM"" has M at position 1 and 5, so it tests M in two positions.

Similarly, ""CODEC"" has C at 1 and 5.

But repeated letters might give less information.

""YODEL"" has Y, O, D, E, L. O and E are known, so we are testing Y at 1, D at 3, and L at 5.

Since D is already known to be present, we are mainly testing the position of D and the new letters Y and L.

Similarly, ""DOPEY"" tests D at 1, P at 3, Y at 5.

We don't know if P, Y, L, M, C are in the word.

Another candidate: what about ""HOMED""? But in ""HOMED"": H, O, M, E, D. But we have O at 2, E at 4, so it would be H O M E D. But position 5 is D, and we know D is not at position 5, so if we guess ""HOMED"", position 5 D would be yellow (misplaced), but we already know that. Also, position 1 is H, position 3 is M.

But ""HOMED"" has D at 5, which is not allowed in the secret word, so it cannot be the secret word because position 5 cannot be D. So we shouldn't guess a word that has D at position 5, as it's invalid for the secret word.

Similarly, any word with D at position 5 is not possible for the secret word.

So back to candidates without D at 5.

Another possibility: ""BOXED"" but has X and E at 4? B O X E D, but position 5 is D, invalid.

""LOBED"": L O B E D, position 5 D, invalid.

So only the candidates I listed.

""MOVED"": M O V E D, position 5 D, invalid.

So I think the main candidates are ""DOPEY"", ""YODEL"", ""MODEM"", ""CODEC"".

""MODEM"" and ""CODEC"" have repeated letters, which might not be ideal for getting new information.

""YODEL"" and ""DOPEY"" have all unique letters.

""YODEL"" has L, which is common.

""DOPEY"" has P and Y.

Y is less common than L or P.

Perhaps ""YODEL"" is better.

But let's see if there are other words.

What about ""JOWEL""? But J, and E at 4? J O W E L, positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:L. So it fits, and no D? But we need D in the word. The secret word must contain D, so if we guess ""JOWEL"", it doesn't have D, which would be bad because we know D is in the word, so we should include D to confirm or test its position.

Similarly, we must include D in the guess because it's a known letter.

So we cannot guess a word without D.

Therefore, ""DOPEY"" or ""YODEL"" or ""MODEM"" etc.

Another word: ""GODET"" - a term in sewing, but obscure.

""BOWED"": B O W E D, but position 5 D, invalid.

""COWED"": C O W E D, position 5 D, invalid.

So I think ""DOPEY"" or ""YODEL"" are the best.

Now, to decide: in ""DOPEY"", D is at position 1, which is a possibility, and in ""YODEL"", D is at position 3.

We don't know which, so we need to choose one.

Perhaps we can choose based on commonality or letter frequency.

P is more common than Y, but L is common.

""YODEL"" has L at position 5, which is a common consonant.

I think both are reasonable.

Since in ""NOTED"" D was at position 5 and misplaced, and position 1 and 3 are open, we can try D at position 1.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has more common letters.

Another idea: ""MOPED"" but has E at 4? M O P E D, position 5 D, invalid.

Not possible.

""LOPED"": L O P E D, position 5 D, invalid.

So no.

""POKED"": P O K E D, position 5 D, invalid.

Therefore, I think ""DOPEY"" is a good choice.

""DOZEY"" but Z and Y, and N not, but no N, but Z is rare.

Not good.

So I'll go with ""DOPEY"".

But let's confirm the pattern: secret word is _ O _ E _

With ""DOPEY"": D O P E Y, so if correct, position 1: D, 2: O, 3: P, 4: E, 5: Y.

We know O and E are correct, so we would get feedback on D, P, Y.

If D is correct at position 1, it should be green; if not, yellow or gray, but we know D is in the word, so if not at 1, it must be at 3, so it would be yellow if at 3, or if not, but we know it's in the word, so if not at 1, it must be at 3, so it should be yellow for position 1 if D is at 3.

Similarly for P and Y.

But we might solve it.

""YODEL"": Y O D E L, position 1:Y, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:L.

If D is at position 3, it would be green; if at position 1, it would be yellow for position 3? If D is at position 1, then in ""YODEL"", position 3 D would be yellow if D is at 1, but position 1 Y might be something else.

But we can try.

I think for the guess, we can choose ""YODEL"" to test D at position 3.

But let's see the frequency.

Perhaps we can list all possible words from the dictionary.

But since I don't have the full dictionary, I'll go with common words.

Another common word: ""HOMER"" but R excluded.

""COVER"" R excluded.

""BOXER"" R and X.

Not.

I think ""YODEL"" is a reasonable choice.

But Y is not very common, so perhaps ""MODEM"" is better, but repeated M.

""MODEM"" is common in tech.

But let's choose ""YODEL"".

To avoid Y, is there a word with more common letters?

What about ""LOBED"" but position 5 D invalid.

""POLED"": P O L E D, position 5 D invalid.

""FOYER"": F O Y E R, but R excluded.

Not.

""GONEF"" not a word.

I think ""DOPEY"" or ""YODEL"" are the options.

I'll go with ""YODEL"" as it has L, which is common.

So guess: ""YODEL""

But in ""YODEL"", position 3 is D, so if D is not at position 3, we get information.

Similarly, position 1 is Y, position 5 is L.

So it should be informative.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)  
  This means:  
  - R, A, I, S are absent from the secret word.  
  - E is present but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: NOTED** → Feedback: N(x), O(✓), T(x), E(✓), D(-)  
  This means:  
  - N and T are absent.  
  - O is correct and in position 2.  
  - E is correct and in position 4.  
  - D is present but not in position 5.  

### Key Inferences:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ O _ E _` (O in position 2, E in position 4).  
- D is in the word but not in position 5. Since positions 2 and 4 are fixed, D must be in position 1 or 3.  
- Absent letters (excluded from guesses): R, A, I, S, N, T.  
- Known present letters: O (position 2), E (position 4), D (position unknown, but not 5).  
- Available letters for new guesses: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since R, A, I, S, N, T are excluded).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The goal is to test the position of D (position 1 or 3) and introduce new common letters to gather more information.  
- A strong candidate is **YODEL**:  
  - Fits the pattern `_ O _ E _` with Y in position 1, O in position 2 (fixed), D in position 3, E in position 4 (fixed), and L in position 5.  
  - Tests D in position 3: If D is correct here, it will be confirmed (✓). If not, it may be misplaced (indicating D is in position 1).  
  - Introduces new common letters: Y (position 1) and L (position 5), which are untested and could provide valuable feedback.  
  - Avoids excluded letters and is a valid English word.  

This guess will help narrow down the possibilities significantly by:  
- Confirming or ruling out D in position 3.  
- Testing Y and L for presence/position.  
- Reducing the remaining letter pool for positions 1, 3, and 5.  

<guess>YODEL</guess>",YODEL,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: absent (x)
- A: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: present but misplaced (-)

Guess 2: NOTED
- N: absent (x)
- O: correct position (✓) at position 2 (since O is the second letter in ""NOTED"")
- T: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 4 (since E is the fourth letter in ""NOTED"")
- D: present but misplaced (-)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word contains the letter O in the second position (position 2).
2. The secret word contains the letter E in the fourth position (position 4).
3. The secret word contains the letter D, but not in the fifth position (since in ""NOTED"", D was at position 5 and is misplaced).
4. The following letters are absent: R, A, I, S, N, T. So we can exclude these.

Also, from the first guess, we know E is present but not in position 5, and now we know it is in position 4.

The secret word has the form: _ O _ E _

We also know D is in the word but not at position 5. So D must be in one of the first three positions? But positions 2 and 4 are taken by O and E, so D must be in position 1 or 3.

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Position 2: O (fixed)
Position 4: E (fixed)
Position 5: cannot be D (since D was misplaced at position 5 in ""NOTED""), and also, we know from the first guess that E was not at position 5, which is consistent.

So D must be at position 1 or 3.

Additionally, we have no information about other letters.

We need to find a word that fits: _ O _ E _

With D in position 1 or 3, and the missing letters must not be R, A, I, S, N, T.

Also, we have used: R, A, I, S, E, N, O, T, D. So available letters are the rest of the alphabet.

Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need common letters.

Now, the word must have D in it, at position 1 or 3.

Case 1: D at position 1 -> D O _ E _
Case 2: D at position 3 -> _ O D E _

We need to fill the blanks with letters not excluded.

Also, since D is misplaced at position 5, it must be in the word but not at 5, which is satisfied as long as it's at 1 or 3.

Now, let's think of possible words.

First, if D is at position 1: ""DO _ E _""

Possible words: DOZEN, DOGES, DOGMA, etc.

But DOZEN: Z is not very common, and we have N excluded? N is absent, so cannot use N. DOZEN has N, which is excluded.

Similarly, DOGES: G, E, S. But S is excluded, so no.

DOGMA: G, M, A. A is excluded.

DOWSE: W, S, E. S excluded.

DOPEY: P, E, Y. But E is already at position 4, and Y is possible. But ""DOPEY"" has E at position 4? D O P E Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:P, 4:E, 5:Y. But we have E at position 4, which is correct, and O at 2 correct. D is at position 1, which is new. But we need to check if D is allowed at position 1? The feedback said D is misplaced at position 5, but it can be at position 1. However, in ""DOPEY"", the fifth letter is Y, not D, so that's fine. But we must not use excluded letters. Excluded: R,A,I,S,N,T. So P and Y are allowed.

But is ""DOPEY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning sleepy or dazed.

But let's see if it fits: secret word has O at 2, E at 4, and D must be present. In ""DOPEY"", D is at 1, so it should be present. But the feedback for D in guess 2 was misplaced, meaning D is in the word but not at position 5. In ""DOPEY"", D is at 1, so it's fine.

But we have to make sure about the other letters.

In ""DOPEY"", we have P at position 3 and Y at position 5.

Now, second case: D at position 3: _ O D E _

Possible words: BODED, BODES, CODED, CODEC, CODER, CODES, GODET, HODAD, JODEL, LODEN, LODES, MODEM, MODER, MODES, NODES, RODEO, RODES, WODGE, YODEL, etc.

But we have exclusions: R,A,I,S,N,T are absent. So we cannot have words with these.

For example, BODED: B, O, D, E, D. But D repeated? And E at 4. But N is not in it? BODED has B, O, D, E, D. Letters: B, O, D, E. D repeated? The word is B-O-D-E-D, so positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:D. But we have D at position 3 and 5. But in our feedback, D is present, but we don't know if it can be repeated. However, in the first guess, we had no repeated letters, but the secret word might have duplicates.

But in the feedback for ""NOTED"", D was at position 5 and was misplaced, meaning that at least one D is in the word, but not at position 5. If the word has two D's, it could have one at position 5, but the feedback says D is misplaced at position 5, which would imply that D is not at position 5, even if there are multiple. So position 5 cannot be D. Therefore, in ""BODED"", position 5 is D, which would be incorrect, but the word has D at position 3 as well. However, the feedback for ""NOTED"" said D is present but not at position 5, so if we guess a word with D at position 5, it would be marked as misplaced if there is another D, or absent if no other D? But in standard Wordle, if a letter is in the word multiple times, the feedback can be tricky.

To avoid complexity, let's assume for now that the secret word has only one D, since we have no evidence of duplicates. But it might have.

But in ""BODED"", if we guess it, and the secret word has only one D, then position 5 D would be absent if D is at position 3, but we know D is in the word, so it might be marked as misplaced if the position is wrong, but since position 5 is not correct, and D is present elsewhere, it would be marked as misplaced for position 5? I think I need to recall the rules.

Standard Wordle feedback: for each position, if the letter is correct, green; if the letter is in the word but in wrong position, yellow; if not in word, gray. If there are multiple, it can be yellow for one and gray for another if the count is exceeded.

But in this case, for ""NOTED"", D at position 5 was yellow, meaning D is in the word but not at position 5. So the secret word has at least one D, and position 5 is not D.

If the secret word has only one D, then in a guess, if we put D at position 5, it should be yellow only if there is another D? No, if we put D at position 5 and the secret word has D only at, say, position 1, then position 5 D should be yellow (since D is in the word but not here). But if the secret word has no D at all, it would be gray. But we know D is in the word, so if we put D at position 5, it should be yellow, because D is present but not at position 5.

Similarly, if we put D at a position where it is not, but D is in the word, it should be yellow.

Back to the point.

For the secret word, we have positions 2 and 4 fixed: O and E.

Position 1 and 3 and 5 to fill, with D in position 1 or 3.

Also, position 5 cannot be D.

Now, from the list, with exclusions.

First, D at position 1: ""DO _ E _""

Possible words: DOGES, but S excluded.

DOGMA, A excluded.

DOWSE, S excluded.

DOPEY: D O P E Y. P and Y are allowed. And no excluded letters. So ""DOPEY"" is a candidate.

Other: DOVEN? Not common.

DOZED, but Z and D repeated? DOZED: D O Z E D. D at 1 and 5. But position 5 is D, which we know cannot be D because in ""NOTED"" D at 5 was misplaced, so position 5 is not D. Therefore, ""DOZED"" would have D at 5, which is invalid for the secret word. So not.

Similarly, ""DOPEY"" has Y at 5, not D.

Now, D at position 3: "" _ O D E _""

Possible words: BODED, but has D at 5, which is invalid.

BODES: B O D E S, but S excluded.

CODES: C O D E S, S excluded.

MODES: M O D E S, S excluded.

RODEO: R O D E O, but R excluded, and O repeated? R O D E O, positions: 1:R (excluded), 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:O. O is at position 2 and 5, but we have O at position 2 fixed, so position 5 could be O? But in this word, it has two O's. But R is excluded, so invalid.

YODEL: Y O D E L. Letters: Y, O, D, E, L. O at 2, E at 4. D at 3. Position 5 is L. No excluded letters. So ""YODEL"" is a candidate.

Similarly, WODGE: W O D G E, but E is at position 5? W O D G E -> positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. But we have E at position 4 fixed, but here E is at 5, so not matching. Secret word has E at position 4, so position 4 must be E. In ""WODGE"", position 4 is G, not E, so it doesn't fit the pattern.

We need position 4 to be E.

Similarly, MODEM: M O D E M. Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:M. So this fits: _ O D E _ with M at 1 and 5. And no excluded letters. M is allowed.

Similarly, CODEC: C O D E C. C at 1 and 5.

But CODEC might be considered a tech word, but it's valid.

HODAD: H O D A D, but A excluded.

JODEL: similar to YODEL, but J is less common.

LODEN: L O D E N, but N excluded.

So possible candidates: 
- D at 1: ""DOPEY"" (D O P E Y)
- D at 3: ""YODEL"" (Y O D E L) or ""MODEM"" (M O D E M) or ""CODEC"" (C O D E C)

We need to choose one for the guess.

We also have to consider that in ""DOPEY"", D is at position 1, and in ""YODEL"", D is at position 3. We don't know which is correct, so we need to test.

Moreover, we have other positions to fill.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that tests letters we haven't used.

We have used: R,A,I,S,E,N,O,T,D. So available: B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

In the candidates:
- ""DOPEY"": uses P and Y
- ""YODEL"": uses Y, D, E, L (but D and E are known, so new are Y and L)
- ""MODEM"": uses M and M (repeated)
- ""CODEC"": uses C and C (repeated)

""MODEM"" has M at position 1 and 5, so it tests M in two positions.

Similarly, ""CODEC"" has C at 1 and 5.

But repeated letters might give less information.

""YODEL"" has Y, O, D, E, L. O and E are known, so we are testing Y at 1, D at 3, and L at 5.

Since D is already known to be present, we are mainly testing the position of D and the new letters Y and L.

Similarly, ""DOPEY"" tests D at 1, P at 3, Y at 5.

We don't know if P, Y, L, M, C are in the word.

Another candidate: what about ""HOMED""? But in ""HOMED"": H, O, M, E, D. But we have O at 2, E at 4, so it would be H O M E D. But position 5 is D, and we know D is not at position 5, so if we guess ""HOMED"", position 5 D would be yellow (misplaced), but we already know that. Also, position 1 is H, position 3 is M.

But ""HOMED"" has D at 5, which is not allowed in the secret word, so it cannot be the secret word because position 5 cannot be D. So we shouldn't guess a word that has D at position 5, as it's invalid for the secret word.

Similarly, any word with D at position 5 is not possible for the secret word.

So back to candidates without D at 5.

Another possibility: ""BOXED"" but has X and E at 4? B O X E D, but position 5 is D, invalid.

""LOBED"": L O B E D, position 5 D, invalid.

So only the candidates I listed.

""MOVED"": M O V E D, position 5 D, invalid.

So I think the main candidates are ""DOPEY"", ""YODEL"", ""MODEM"", ""CODEC"".

""MODEM"" and ""CODEC"" have repeated letters, which might not be ideal for getting new information.

""YODEL"" and ""DOPEY"" have all unique letters.

""YODEL"" has L, which is common.

""DOPEY"" has P and Y.

Y is less common than L or P.

Perhaps ""YODEL"" is better.

But let's see if there are other words.

What about ""JOWEL""? But J, and E at 4? J O W E L, positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:L. So it fits, and no D? But we need D in the word. The secret word must contain D, so if we guess ""JOWEL"", it doesn't have D, which would be bad because we know D is in the word, so we should include D to confirm or test its position.

Similarly, we must include D in the guess because it's a known letter.

So we cannot guess a word without D.

Therefore, ""DOPEY"" or ""YODEL"" or ""MODEM"" etc.

Another word: ""GODET"" - a term in sewing, but obscure.

""BOWED"": B O W E D, but position 5 D, invalid.

""COWED"": C O W E D, position 5 D, invalid.

So I think ""DOPEY"" or ""YODEL"" are the best.

Now, to decide: in ""DOPEY"", D is at position 1, which is a possibility, and in ""YODEL"", D is at position 3.

We don't know which, so we need to choose one.

Perhaps we can choose based on commonality or letter frequency.

P is more common than Y, but L is common.

""YODEL"" has L at position 5, which is a common consonant.

I think both are reasonable.

Since in ""NOTED"" D was at position 5 and misplaced, and position 1 and 3 are open, we can try D at position 1.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has more common letters.

Another idea: ""MOPED"" but has E at 4? M O P E D, position 5 D, invalid.

Not possible.

""LOPED"": L O P E D, position 5 D, invalid.

So no.

""POKED"": P O K E D, position 5 D, invalid.

Therefore, I think ""DOPEY"" is a good choice.

""DOZEY"" but Z and Y, and N not, but no N, but Z is rare.

Not good.

So I'll go with ""DOPEY"".

But let's confirm the pattern: secret word is _ O _ E _

With ""DOPEY"": D O P E Y, so if correct, position 1: D, 2: O, 3: P, 4: E, 5: Y.

We know O and E are correct, so we would get feedback on D, P, Y.

If D is correct at position 1, it should be green; if not, yellow or gray, but we know D is in the word, so if not at 1, it must be at 3, so it would be yellow if at 3, or if not, but we know it's in the word, so if not at 1, it must be at 3, so it should be yellow for position 1 if D is at 3.

Similarly for P and Y.

But we might solve it.

""YODEL"": Y O D E L, position 1:Y, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:L.

If D is at position 3, it would be green; if at position 1, it would be yellow for position 3? If D is at position 1, then in ""YODEL"", position 3 D would be yellow if D is at 1, but position 1 Y might be something else.

But we can try.

I think for the guess, we can choose ""YODEL"" to test D at position 3.

But let's see the frequency.

Perhaps we can list all possible words from the dictionary.

But since I don't have the full dictionary, I'll go with common words.

Another common word: ""HOMER"" but R excluded.

""COVER"" R excluded.

""BOXER"" R and X.

Not.

I think ""YODEL"" is a reasonable choice.

But Y is not very common, so perhaps ""MODEM"" is better, but repeated M.

""MODEM"" is common in tech.

But let's choose ""YODEL"".

To avoid Y, is there a word with more common letters?

What about ""LOBED"" but position 5 D invalid.

""POLED"": P O L E D, position 5 D invalid.

""FOYER"": F O Y E R, but R excluded.

Not.

""GONEF"" not a word.

I think ""DOPEY"" or ""YODEL"" are the options.

I'll go with ""YODEL"" as it has L, which is common.

So guess: ""YODEL""

But in ""YODEL"", position 3 is D, so if D is not at position 3, we get information.

Similarly, position 1 is Y, position 5 is L.

So it should be informative.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)  
  This means:  
  - R, A, I, S are absent from the secret word.  
  - E is present but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: NOTED** → Feedback: N(x), O(✓), T(x), E(✓), D(-)  
  This means:  
  - N and T are absent.  
  - O is correct and in position 2.  
  - E is correct and in position 4.  
  - D is present but not in position 5.  

### Key Inferences:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ O _ E _` (O in position 2, E in position 4).  
- D is in the word but not in position 5. Since positions 2 and 4 are fixed, D must be in position 1 or 3.  
- Absent letters (excluded from guesses): R, A, I, S, N, T.  
- Known present letters: O (position 2), E (position 4), D (position unknown, but not 5).  
- Available letters for new guesses: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since R, A, I, S, N, T are excluded).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The goal is to test the position of D (position 1 or 3) and introduce new common letters to gather more information.  
- A strong candidate is **YODEL**:  
  - Fits the pattern `_ O _ E _` with Y in position 1, O in position 2 (fixed), D in position 3, E in position 4 (fixed), and L in position 5.  
  - Tests D in position 3: If D is correct here, it will be confirmed (✓). If not, it may be misplaced (indicating D is in position 1).  
  - Introduces new common letters: Y (position 1) and L (position 5), which are untested and could provide valuable feedback.  
  - Avoids excluded letters and is a valid English word.  

This guess will help narrow down the possibilities significantly by:  
- Confirming or ruling out D in position 3.  
- Testing Y and L for presence/position.  
- Reducing the remaining letter pool for positions 1, 3, and 5.",Guess 3: YODEL -> FEEDBACK: Y(x) O(✓) D(-) E(✓) L(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>First, I need to make my first guess for the 5-letter word game. Since I have no information yet, I should start with a word that has common letters to maximize the chances of getting useful feedback.

Common letters in English words: According to frequency analysis, letters like E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S are among the most common. I should choose a word that includes several of these.

A good starting word in games like Wordle is often ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" because they cover frequent letters and have a good mix of vowels and consonants. Let me think of one.

Possible first guesses:
- ""CRANE"": Letters C, R, A, N, E. All are common.
- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E – also good.
- ""ADIEU"": A, D, I, E, U – has more vowels, which might be useful since vowels are critical.

But in the example, the secret word was ""BRISK"", which starts with B, so I shouldn't assume anything.

Another popular one is ""ROATE"" – but I should use a real word.

Let me confirm: ""CRANE"" is a valid word, meaning a bird or a machine for lifting. ""SLATE"" is valid too.

I think ""CRANE"" is a solid choice because it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R), but C isn't super common; E, A, R, S are better.

Perhaps ""SOARE"" but that might be obscure. I think ""CRATE"" is another option.

Let's list the frequencies:
- E is most common, then A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

A word like ""RAISE"" or ""ARISE"" could be good.

""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E – that includes R, A, I, S, E which are all top letters.

Similarly, ""ROAST"" or ""SLATE"".

To cover different positions, I should choose a word where letters aren't repeating and are diverse.

For my first guess, I'll go with ""RAISE"". It has:
- R: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- I: common vowel
- S: common consonant
- E: common vowel

That seems balanced.

""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E; N is less common than S, so ""RAISE"" might be better.

""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E – S and T are common.

But ""RAISE"" has I instead of L or T; I is a vowel, which might be useful.

I think ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are standard. Since this is the first guess, any reasonable word is fine.

I'll use ""RAISE"" as it covers multiple high-frequency letters.

So, my guess will be ""RAISE"".For the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. Therefore, I should choose a word that maximizes the likelihood of getting useful feedback by including common English letters. According to letter frequency analysis, vowels like E, A, I, and O, as well as consonants like R, S, and T, are highly common in 5-letter words. A good starting word in Wordle-style games should incorporate several of these to test multiple positions simultaneously.  

The word ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:  
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).  
- Letters like E, A, R, I, and S are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English.  
- It has no repeating letters, ensuring broader coverage for feedback.  
- It's a valid English word, adhering to the game rules.  

This feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses. For example:  
- Correct positions (✓) will identify exact matches.  
- Misplaced positions (-) will indicate letters in the word but elsewhere.  
- Absent letters (x) can be eliminated.  

Let's proceed with ""RAISE"" as the first guess.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or S. But it does contain an E, but not in the last position (since in ""RAISE"", E is the 5th letter, and it's misplaced).

Therefore, the secret word has the letter E somewhere in positions 1 to 4, but not position 5.

Also, we know the word does not have R, A, I, S.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:
- Includes E (because we know it's in the word, and we want to find its position)
- Does not include R, A, I, S (since they are absent)
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Since E is in the word but not at the end, it could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We should try a word that has E in a different position, and also introduces new common letters.

Common letters not yet tried: O, T, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can also consider that the word has 5 letters, one of which is E, and the other four are from the remaining alphabet excluding R, A, I, S.

Let's list the available letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to use common ones.

A good candidate might be a word that has E in the first position, for example, to test if E is at the start.

But it could be anywhere. We can try to cover multiple possibilities.

Another idea: use a word with E in the second position, and include other common consonants.

Possible words:

- ""TEPID"" - but we don't know if T, P, D are in the word.
- ""OUNCE"" - but E is at the end, and we know E is not at the end? Wait, no: the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E at the end again, it would be wrong, but we can do that to confirm? Actually, we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at the end, we expect it to be misplaced again? But that might not give new information about the position.

We should avoid putting E at position 5 because we already know it's not there. So we should try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let me think of words with E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then common letters.

Common words: ""EARTH"" but E is first, but we know A and R are not in the word, so we cannot use A or R.

We must avoid R, A, I, S.

So, for position 1: E, then we need other letters.

Possible: ""ELBOW"", ""ENDOW"", ""ENVOY"", ""EJECT"" - but let's think of common ones.

""ELOPE"" - but has O and P, and E at start and end? But we cannot have E at end? Actually, we can have the word contain E only once? Not necessarily, but in this case, we don't know.

The feedback only said E is in the word, but it might have multiple E's? But in ""RAISE"", there was one E, and it was misplaced. So the secret word has at least one E, and it's not at position 5.

But it could have E in multiple positions? We don't know.

To be safe, we should assume it might have only one E for now, but we can test.

But to maximize information, we should try a word with E in a new position and new letters.

Let me list some candidate words without R, A, I, S and with E not at position 5.

For example:
- E in position 1: words like ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""EXPEL"" (but X and P are less common), ""EVERY"" (but has R and Y, R is not allowed because we know R is absent).

We cannot use R, A, I, S.

So, ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W. All new letters? L, B, O, W are new.

Similarly, ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W.

""ENACT"": but has A, which is absent.

""EJECT"": E, J, E, C, T. But J is uncommon, and has two E's? The word is E-J-E-C-T, so positions: E at 1 and 3? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

It might be acceptable, but let's avoid uncommon letters.

Better to use more common letters.

Another idea: E in position 2. For example, ""LEMON"", but L, E, M, O, N. But E is at position 2.

But we don't know if L, M, O, N are in the word.

Similarly, ""BETEL"", ""DEVON"", etc.

But let's think of a word that uses common letters and has E in a position we haven't tested (i.e., not position 5).

In ""RAISE"", E was at position 5. Now we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I think position 1 or 2 might be good.

Also, we should include other vowels if possible, but we know A and I are out, so the only vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y. But E is already in, so we might have O or U.

Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let me try to form a word: How about ""TOUCH""? But no E, and we must include E because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to, but it would be wasteful not to use the information we have.

We know E is in the word, so we should include E in the new guess to find its position.

So, the guess must include E, and not include R, A, I, S.

Also, it should be a valid English word.

Let me think of words with E in position 1: 
- ""E"", then common: L, O, T, N, etc.
  ""ELOPE"": E, L, O, P, E. But E at the end again? We know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at the end, it will be misplaced again, which doesn't help us locate E. So better to avoid position 5 for E.

Therefore, for this guess, we should not put E at position 5.

So, E should be in positions 1,2,3, or 4, but not 5.

In ""ELOPE"", E is at 1 and 5. We can use it, but the E at 5 will be wrong, and we already know that, so it might be a waste of a letter.

Better to have E only once and in a new position.

So, let's avoid words with E at position 5.

Similarly, words with E only in positions 1-4.

For example:
- Position 1: ""ELBOW"", ""ENDOW"", ""EXPEL"" (but X is rare), ""EJECT"" (J is rare), ""EMPTY"" (M, P, T, Y)
- Position 2: ""LEMON"", ""BELOW"", ""DECOY"", ""FETID"", ""GEODE"" (uncommon)
- Position 3: ""OVATE"" (but O, V, A, T, E; A is absent, so invalid), ""INCUR"" (has I and R, absent), so need to avoid absent letters.
  ""OPTER"" (has R, absent), not good.
  ""BUTTE"" (B, U, T, T, E; E at end, which we avoid)
  ""CUBED"" (C, U, B, E, D; E at position 4) -> good, but we don't know about C, U, B, D.

Similarly, position 4: ""PLUME"" (P, L, U, M, E; E at end, avoid), ""CRUDE"" (C, R, U, D, E; R absent, and E at end).

It's tricky.

Let's list some candidate words:

1. ""ELBOW"": E (pos1), L, B, O, W. No E at end. Letters: E, L, B, O, W. All new and common enough.
2. ""ENDOW"": E (pos1), N, D, O, W. Similar.
3. ""BELOW"": B, E (pos2), L, O, W. E at position 2.
4. ""LEMON"": L, E (pos2), M, O, N.
5. ""CUBED"": C, U, B, E (pos4), D. E at position 4, which is new.
6. ""HOMED"": H, O, M, E (pos4), D. E at position 4.

Among these, ""BELOW"" seems good: B, E, L, O, W. Common letters, E at position 2.

""LEMON"" is also good: L, E, M, O, N.

But ""LEMON"" has M and N, which are common.

Another one: ""TOUPE"" - but E at end, avoid.

""POULE"" - obscure.

I think ""BELOW"" or ""LEMON"" are fine.

But we also want to cover more common letters. T is very common, so perhaps a word with T.

For example, ""BETEL"" but E at position 2 and 4? ""BETEL"": B, E, T, E, L. But two E's, and L. But we don't know if double E is possible.

""FETID"": F, E, T, I, D. But I is absent, so invalid.

Cannot use I.

""METRO"" but has R, absent.

""TEPID"" has I and is not allowed.

""DEUCE"": D, E, U, C, E. E at position 2 and 5. Position 5 is bad, so avoid.

""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T. E at position 4. V is less common.

Perhaps ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E. E at end, avoid.

""CHIME"" has I.

So, it's hard to avoid E at the end sometimes.

But we can use a word with E at position 3 or 4.

For example, ""OWLED"" - not common.

""BOXED"": B, O, X, E, D. E at position 4. X is uncommon.

""JOKED"" - J uncommon.

""LOBED"": L, O, B, E, D. E at position 4. Letters: L, O, B, E, D. All new and reasonable.

Similarly, ""LUBED"" - same.

""LOBED"" is a word? LOBED means having lobes, like in biology.

Similarly, ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D. E at position 4. T, O, N, D are common.

""TONED"" seems good: T, O, N, E, D. E at position 4.

We haven't tested T, O, N, D yet.

Similarly, ""CONED"" but C, O, N, E, D. Also good.

But ""TONED"" is more common.

Another one: ""HOPED"" has H, O, P, E, D. E at position 4.

But T is more common than H or P.

So ""TONED"" might be better.

But let's compare to ""BELOW"": ""BELOW"" has B, E, L, O, W. E at position 2.

""TONED"" has T, O, N, E, D. E at position 4.

Both introduce new common letters.

We know E is in the word, so by placing E in different positions, we can get information about its location.

In ""RAISE"", E was at position 5 and was misplaced. Now, if in the new guess, E is at position 2 (like in ""BELOW"") and if it's correct, we get a ✓, or if misplaced, we know it's not at 2.

Similarly for position 4 in ""TONED"".

Since we have no information, trying E in the middle might be good.

I think both are reasonable. I'll go with ""BELOW"" because it has E in position 2, which is a common position for E, and it uses B, L, O, W which are good.

""BELOW"" is a common word.

Another popular choice might be ""CLONE"" but has C, L, O, N, E. E at end, which we want to avoid. So not good.

""MODEL"" has E at position 4? M, O, D, E, L. E at position 4. But L is included.

""MODEL"" is good: M, O, D, E, L. E at position 4.

But ""BELOW"" has W, which is less common than T or N.

Perhaps ""TENOR"" but has R and N, R is absent.

No.

""BONEY"" - not common.

I think ""BELOW"" is acceptable.

To include T, how about ""BETTY"" but has double T and Y, and no E? Not.

""THEFT"" has E at position 3: T, H, E, F, T. But double T, and F and H are less common.

Not ideal.

""DEALT"" has A and E, but A is absent.

So, I think ""BELOW"" or ""TONED"".

Let's choose ""TONED"" because T, O, N, D are very common, and E is at position 4, which is a position we haven't tested (in the first guess, E was at 5, now at 4).

In ""RAISE"", E was at 5, so testing position 4 is adjacent and might be likely.

But no strong reason.

I'll go with ""TONED"".

But ""TONED"" has E at position 4. If the secret word has E at position 4, we get a ✓ for E. If not, we get - or x, but we know E is in the word, so if not at 4, it would be misplaced, telling us it's not at 4.

Similarly for other positions.

Another candidate: ""OUNCE"" has E at end, avoid.

""ELUDE"": E at 1, L, U, D, E. E at end again, so avoid.

""EXILE"" has I and X, not good.

So, ""TONED"" seems solid.

But let's confirm: T, O, N, E, D. All letters not excluded, and E at position 4.

Yes.

We could do ""NOTED"", which is similar: N, O, T, E, D. E at position 4. Same letters.

""NOTED"" is more common than ""TONED""? Both are valid.

I'll use ""NOTED"" for familiarity.

""NOTED"": N, O, T, E, D.

So, second guess: ""NOTED"".

But we must not use R, A, I, S, which we aren't.

So, I think that's good.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, S are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- E is present but misplaced (-), meaning it is in the secret word but not in position 5.

For the second guess:
- The word must include E (since it is confirmed in the secret word) but not in position 5 (as it was misplaced there in ""RAISE"").
- It must avoid R, A, I, S entirely.
- To maximize information, use common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, O, N, D) and place E in a new position (1–4) to narrow down its location.

A strong candidate is ""NOTED"":
- It includes E in position 4 (a new position to test).
- It introduces new common letters: T, O, N, D.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help:
- Confirm if E is in position 4 (✓), or if misplaced (-), reveal another possible position.
- Test T, O, N, D for presence/position.

<guess>NOTED</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: NOTED -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) D(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: absent (x)
- A: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: present but misplaced (-)

Guess 2: NOTED
- N: absent (x)
- O: correct position (✓) at position 2 (since O is the second letter in ""NOTED"")
- T: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 4 (since E is the fourth letter in ""NOTED"")
- D: present but misplaced (-)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word contains the letter O in the second position (position 2).
2. The secret word contains the letter E in the fourth position (position 4).
3. The secret word contains the letter D, but not in the fifth position (since in ""NOTED"", D was at position 5 and is misplaced).
4. The following letters are absent: R, A, I, S, N, T. So we can exclude these.

Also, from the first guess, we know E is present but not in position 5, and now we know it is in position 4.

The secret word has the form: _ O _ E _

We also know D is in the word but not at position 5. So D must be in one of the first three positions? But positions 2 and 4 are taken by O and E, so D must be in position 1 or 3.

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Position 2: O (fixed)
Position 4: E (fixed)
Position 5: cannot be D (since D was misplaced at position 5 in ""NOTED""), and also, we know from the first guess that E was not at position 5, which is consistent.

So D must be at position 1 or 3.

Additionally, we have no information about other letters.

We need to find a word that fits: _ O _ E _

With D in position 1 or 3, and the missing letters must not be R, A, I, S, N, T.

Also, we have used: R, A, I, S, E, N, O, T, D. So available letters are the rest of the alphabet.

Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need common letters.

Now, the word must have D in it, at position 1 or 3.

Case 1: D at position 1 -> D O _ E _
Case 2: D at position 3 -> _ O D E _

We need to fill the blanks with letters not excluded.

Also, since D is misplaced at position 5, it must be in the word but not at 5, which is satisfied as long as it's at 1 or 3.

Now, let's think of possible words.

First, if D is at position 1: ""DO _ E _""

Possible words: DOZEN, DOGES, DOGMA, etc.

But DOZEN: Z is not very common, and we have N excluded? N is absent, so cannot use N. DOZEN has N, which is excluded.

Similarly, DOGES: G, E, S. But S is excluded, so no.

DOGMA: G, M, A. A is excluded.

DOWSE: W, S, E. S excluded.

DOPEY: P, E, Y. But E is already at position 4, and Y is possible. But ""DOPEY"" has E at position 4? D O P E Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:P, 4:E, 5:Y. But we have E at position 4, which is correct, and O at 2 correct. D is at position 1, which is new. But we need to check if D is allowed at position 1? The feedback said D is misplaced at position 5, but it can be at position 1. However, in ""DOPEY"", the fifth letter is Y, not D, so that's fine. But we must not use excluded letters. Excluded: R,A,I,S,N,T. So P and Y are allowed.

But is ""DOPEY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning sleepy or dazed.

But let's see if it fits: secret word has O at 2, E at 4, and D must be present. In ""DOPEY"", D is at 1, so it should be present. But the feedback for D in guess 2 was misplaced, meaning D is in the word but not at position 5. In ""DOPEY"", D is at 1, so it's fine.

But we have to make sure about the other letters.

In ""DOPEY"", we have P at position 3 and Y at position 5.

Now, second case: D at position 3: _ O D E _

Possible words: BODED, BODES, CODED, CODEC, CODER, CODES, GODET, HODAD, JODEL, LODEN, LODES, MODEM, MODER, MODES, NODES, RODEO, RODES, WODGE, YODEL, etc.

But we have exclusions: R,A,I,S,N,T are absent. So we cannot have words with these.

For example, BODED: B, O, D, E, D. But D repeated? And E at 4. But N is not in it? BODED has B, O, D, E, D. Letters: B, O, D, E. D repeated? The word is B-O-D-E-D, so positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:D. But we have D at position 3 and 5. But in our feedback, D is present, but we don't know if it can be repeated. However, in the first guess, we had no repeated letters, but the secret word might have duplicates.

But in the feedback for ""NOTED"", D was at position 5 and was misplaced, meaning that at least one D is in the word, but not at position 5. If the word has two D's, it could have one at position 5, but the feedback says D is misplaced at position 5, which would imply that D is not at position 5, even if there are multiple. So position 5 cannot be D. Therefore, in ""BODED"", position 5 is D, which would be incorrect, but the word has D at position 3 as well. However, the feedback for ""NOTED"" said D is present but not at position 5, so if we guess a word with D at position 5, it would be marked as misplaced if there is another D, or absent if no other D? But in standard Wordle, if a letter is in the word multiple times, the feedback can be tricky.

To avoid complexity, let's assume for now that the secret word has only one D, since we have no evidence of duplicates. But it might have.

But in ""BODED"", if we guess it, and the secret word has only one D, then position 5 D would be absent if D is at position 3, but we know D is in the word, so it might be marked as misplaced if the position is wrong, but since position 5 is not correct, and D is present elsewhere, it would be marked as misplaced for position 5? I think I need to recall the rules.

Standard Wordle feedback: for each position, if the letter is correct, green; if the letter is in the word but in wrong position, yellow; if not in word, gray. If there are multiple, it can be yellow for one and gray for another if the count is exceeded.

But in this case, for ""NOTED"", D at position 5 was yellow, meaning D is in the word but not at position 5. So the secret word has at least one D, and position 5 is not D.

If the secret word has only one D, then in a guess, if we put D at position 5, it should be yellow only if there is another D? No, if we put D at position 5 and the secret word has D only at, say, position 1, then position 5 D should be yellow (since D is in the word but not here). But if the secret word has no D at all, it would be gray. But we know D is in the word, so if we put D at position 5, it should be yellow, because D is present but not at position 5.

Similarly, if we put D at a position where it is not, but D is in the word, it should be yellow.

Back to the point.

For the secret word, we have positions 2 and 4 fixed: O and E.

Position 1 and 3 and 5 to fill, with D in position 1 or 3.

Also, position 5 cannot be D.

Now, from the list, with exclusions.

First, D at position 1: ""DO _ E _""

Possible words: DOGES, but S excluded.

DOGMA, A excluded.

DOWSE, S excluded.

DOPEY: D O P E Y. P and Y are allowed. And no excluded letters. So ""DOPEY"" is a candidate.

Other: DOVEN? Not common.

DOZED, but Z and D repeated? DOZED: D O Z E D. D at 1 and 5. But position 5 is D, which we know cannot be D because in ""NOTED"" D at 5 was misplaced, so position 5 is not D. Therefore, ""DOZED"" would have D at 5, which is invalid for the secret word. So not.

Similarly, ""DOPEY"" has Y at 5, not D.

Now, D at position 3: "" _ O D E _""

Possible words: BODED, but has D at 5, which is invalid.

BODES: B O D E S, but S excluded.

CODES: C O D E S, S excluded.

MODES: M O D E S, S excluded.

RODEO: R O D E O, but R excluded, and O repeated? R O D E O, positions: 1:R (excluded), 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:O. O is at position 2 and 5, but we have O at position 2 fixed, so position 5 could be O? But in this word, it has two O's. But R is excluded, so invalid.

YODEL: Y O D E L. Letters: Y, O, D, E, L. O at 2, E at 4. D at 3. Position 5 is L. No excluded letters. So ""YODEL"" is a candidate.

Similarly, WODGE: W O D G E, but E is at position 5? W O D G E -> positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. But we have E at position 4 fixed, but here E is at 5, so not matching. Secret word has E at position 4, so position 4 must be E. In ""WODGE"", position 4 is G, not E, so it doesn't fit the pattern.

We need position 4 to be E.

Similarly, MODEM: M O D E M. Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:M. So this fits: _ O D E _ with M at 1 and 5. And no excluded letters. M is allowed.

Similarly, CODEC: C O D E C. C at 1 and 5.

But CODEC might be considered a tech word, but it's valid.

HODAD: H O D A D, but A excluded.

JODEL: similar to YODEL, but J is less common.

LODEN: L O D E N, but N excluded.

So possible candidates: 
- D at 1: ""DOPEY"" (D O P E Y)
- D at 3: ""YODEL"" (Y O D E L) or ""MODEM"" (M O D E M) or ""CODEC"" (C O D E C)

We need to choose one for the guess.

We also have to consider that in ""DOPEY"", D is at position 1, and in ""YODEL"", D is at position 3. We don't know which is correct, so we need to test.

Moreover, we have other positions to fill.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that tests letters we haven't used.

We have used: R,A,I,S,E,N,O,T,D. So available: B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

In the candidates:
- ""DOPEY"": uses P and Y
- ""YODEL"": uses Y, D, E, L (but D and E are known, so new are Y and L)
- ""MODEM"": uses M and M (repeated)
- ""CODEC"": uses C and C (repeated)

""MODEM"" has M at position 1 and 5, so it tests M in two positions.

Similarly, ""CODEC"" has C at 1 and 5.

But repeated letters might give less information.

""YODEL"" has Y, O, D, E, L. O and E are known, so we are testing Y at 1, D at 3, and L at 5.

Since D is already known to be present, we are mainly testing the position of D and the new letters Y and L.

Similarly, ""DOPEY"" tests D at 1, P at 3, Y at 5.

We don't know if P, Y, L, M, C are in the word.

Another candidate: what about ""HOMED""? But in ""HOMED"": H, O, M, E, D. But we have O at 2, E at 4, so it would be H O M E D. But position 5 is D, and we know D is not at position 5, so if we guess ""HOMED"", position 5 D would be yellow (misplaced), but we already know that. Also, position 1 is H, position 3 is M.

But ""HOMED"" has D at 5, which is not allowed in the secret word, so it cannot be the secret word because position 5 cannot be D. So we shouldn't guess a word that has D at position 5, as it's invalid for the secret word.

Similarly, any word with D at position 5 is not possible for the secret word.

So back to candidates without D at 5.

Another possibility: ""BOXED"" but has X and E at 4? B O X E D, but position 5 is D, invalid.

""LOBED"": L O B E D, position 5 D, invalid.

So only the candidates I listed.

""MOVED"": M O V E D, position 5 D, invalid.

So I think the main candidates are ""DOPEY"", ""YODEL"", ""MODEM"", ""CODEC"".

""MODEM"" and ""CODEC"" have repeated letters, which might not be ideal for getting new information.

""YODEL"" and ""DOPEY"" have all unique letters.

""YODEL"" has L, which is common.

""DOPEY"" has P and Y.

Y is less common than L or P.

Perhaps ""YODEL"" is better.

But let's see if there are other words.

What about ""JOWEL""? But J, and E at 4? J O W E L, positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:L. So it fits, and no D? But we need D in the word. The secret word must contain D, so if we guess ""JOWEL"", it doesn't have D, which would be bad because we know D is in the word, so we should include D to confirm or test its position.

Similarly, we must include D in the guess because it's a known letter.

So we cannot guess a word without D.

Therefore, ""DOPEY"" or ""YODEL"" or ""MODEM"" etc.

Another word: ""GODET"" - a term in sewing, but obscure.

""BOWED"": B O W E D, but position 5 D, invalid.

""COWED"": C O W E D, position 5 D, invalid.

So I think ""DOPEY"" or ""YODEL"" are the best.

Now, to decide: in ""DOPEY"", D is at position 1, which is a possibility, and in ""YODEL"", D is at position 3.

We don't know which, so we need to choose one.

Perhaps we can choose based on commonality or letter frequency.

P is more common than Y, but L is common.

""YODEL"" has L at position 5, which is a common consonant.

I think both are reasonable.

Since in ""NOTED"" D was at position 5 and misplaced, and position 1 and 3 are open, we can try D at position 1.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Perhaps we can choose a word that has more common letters.

Another idea: ""MOPED"" but has E at 4? M O P E D, position 5 D, invalid.

Not possible.

""LOPED"": L O P E D, position 5 D, invalid.

So no.

""POKED"": P O K E D, position 5 D, invalid.

Therefore, I think ""DOPEY"" is a good choice.

""DOZEY"" but Z and Y, and N not, but no N, but Z is rare.

Not good.

So I'll go with ""DOPEY"".

But let's confirm the pattern: secret word is _ O _ E _

With ""DOPEY"": D O P E Y, so if correct, position 1: D, 2: O, 3: P, 4: E, 5: Y.

We know O and E are correct, so we would get feedback on D, P, Y.

If D is correct at position 1, it should be green; if not, yellow or gray, but we know D is in the word, so if not at 1, it must be at 3, so it would be yellow if at 3, or if not, but we know it's in the word, so if not at 1, it must be at 3, so it should be yellow for position 1 if D is at 3.

Similarly for P and Y.

But we might solve it.

""YODEL"": Y O D E L, position 1:Y, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:L.

If D is at position 3, it would be green; if at position 1, it would be yellow for position 3? If D is at position 1, then in ""YODEL"", position 3 D would be yellow if D is at 1, but position 1 Y might be something else.

But we can try.

I think for the guess, we can choose ""YODEL"" to test D at position 3.

But let's see the frequency.

Perhaps we can list all possible words from the dictionary.

But since I don't have the full dictionary, I'll go with common words.

Another common word: ""HOMER"" but R excluded.

""COVER"" R excluded.

""BOXER"" R and X.

Not.

I think ""YODEL"" is a reasonable choice.

But Y is not very common, so perhaps ""MODEM"" is better, but repeated M.

""MODEM"" is common in tech.

But let's choose ""YODEL"".

To avoid Y, is there a word with more common letters?

What about ""LOBED"" but position 5 D invalid.

""POLED"": P O L E D, position 5 D invalid.

""FOYER"": F O Y E R, but R excluded.

Not.

""GONEF"" not a word.

I think ""DOPEY"" or ""YODEL"" are the options.

I'll go with ""YODEL"" as it has L, which is common.

So guess: ""YODEL""

But in ""YODEL"", position 3 is D, so if D is not at position 3, we get information.

Similarly, position 1 is Y, position 5 is L.

So it should be informative.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)  
  This means:  
  - R, A, I, S are absent from the secret word.  
  - E is present but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: NOTED** → Feedback: N(x), O(✓), T(x), E(✓), D(-)  
  This means:  
  - N and T are absent.  
  - O is correct and in position 2.  
  - E is correct and in position 4.  
  - D is present but not in position 5.  

### Key Inferences:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ O _ E _` (O in position 2, E in position 4).  
- D is in the word but not in position 5. Since positions 2 and 4 are fixed, D must be in position 1 or 3.  
- Absent letters (excluded from guesses): R, A, I, S, N, T.  
- Known present letters: O (position 2), E (position 4), D (position unknown, but not 5).  
- Available letters for new guesses: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since R, A, I, S, N, T are excluded).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The goal is to test the position of D (position 1 or 3) and introduce new common letters to gather more information.  
- A strong candidate is **YODEL**:  
  - Fits the pattern `_ O _ E _` with Y in position 1, O in position 2 (fixed), D in position 3, E in position 4 (fixed), and L in position 5.  
  - Tests D in position 3: If D is correct here, it will be confirmed (✓). If not, it may be misplaced (indicating D is in position 1).  
  - Introduces new common letters: Y (position 1) and L (position 5), which are untested and could provide valuable feedback.  
  - Avoids excluded letters and is a valid English word.  

This guess will help narrow down the possibilities significantly by:  
- Confirming or ruling out D in position 3.  
- Testing Y and L for presence/position.  
- Reducing the remaining letter pool for positions 1, 3, and 5.

Since this is the first guess, any reasonable word is fine.\n\nI\'ll use ""RAISE"" as it covers multiple high-frequency letters.\n\nSo, my guess will be ""RAISE"".For the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. Therefore, I should choose a word that maximizes the likelihood of getting useful feedback by including common English letters. According to letter frequency analysis, vowels like E, A, I, and O, as well as consonants like R, S, and T, are highly common in 5-letter words. A good starting word in Wordle-style games should incorporate several of these to test multiple positions simultaneously.  \n\nThe word ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:  \n- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).  \n- Letters like E, A, R, I, and S are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English.  \n- It has no repeating letters, ensuring broader coverage for feedback.  \n- It\'s a valid English word, adhering to the game rules.  \n\nThis feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses. For example:  \n- Correct positions (✓) will identify exact matches.  \n- Misplaced positions (-) will indicate letters in the word but elsewhere.  \n- Absent letters (x) can be eliminated.  \n\nLet\'s proceed with ""RAISE"" as the first guess.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or S. But it does contain an E, but not in the last position (since in ""RAISE"", E is the 5th letter, and it\'s misplaced).\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the letter E somewhere in positions 1 to 4, but not position 5.\n\nAlso, we know the word does not have R, A, I, S.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. We must choose a 5-letter word that:\n- Includes E (because we know it\'s in the word, and we want to find its position)\n- Does not include R, A, I, S (since they are absent)\n- Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\nSince E is in the word but not at the end, it could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe should try a word that has E in a different position, and also introduces new common letters.\n\nCommon letters not yet tried: O, T, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can also consider that the word has 5 letters, one of which is E, and the other four are from the remaining alphabet excluding R, A, I, S.\n\nLet\'s list the available letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want to use common ones.\n\nA good candidate might be a word that has E in the first position, for example, to test if E is at the start.\n\nBut it could be anywhere. We can try to cover multiple possibilities.\n\nAnother idea: use a word with E in the second position, and include other common consonants.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""TEPID"" - but we don\'t know if T, P, D are in the word.\n- ""OUNCE"" - but E is at the end, and we know E is not at the end? Wait, no: the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E at the end again, it would be wrong, but we can do that to confirm? Actually, we know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at the end, we expect it to be misplaced again? But that might not give new information about the position.\n\nWe should avoid putting E at position 5 because we already know it\'s not there. So we should try E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nLet me think of words with E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then common letters.\n\nCommon words: ""EARTH"" but E is first, but we know A and R are not in the word, so we cannot use A or R.\n\nWe must avoid R, A, I, S.\n\nSo, for position 1: E, then we need other letters.\n\nPossible: ""ELBOW"", ""ENDOW"", ""ENVOY"", ""EJECT"" - but let\'s think of common ones.\n\n""ELOPE"" - but has O and P, and E at start and end? But we cannot have E at end? Actually, we can have the word contain E only once? Not necessarily, but in this case, we don\'t know.\n\nThe feedback only said E is in the word, but it might have multiple E\'s? But in ""RAISE"", there was one E, and it was misplaced. So the secret word has at least one E, and it\'s not at position 5.\n\nBut it could have E in multiple positions? We don\'t know.\n\nTo be safe, we should assume it might have only one E for now, but we can test.\n\nBut to maximize information, we should try a word with E in a new position and new letters.\n\nLet me list some candidate words without R, A, I, S and with E not at position 5.\n\nFor example:\n- E in position 1: words like ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""EXPEL"" (but X and P are less common), ""EVERY"" (but has R and Y, R is not allowed because we know R is absent).\n\nWe cannot use R, A, I, S.\n\nSo, ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W. All new letters? L, B, O, W are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W.\n\n""ENACT"": but has A, which is absent.\n\n""EJECT"": E, J, E, C, T. But J is uncommon, and has two E\'s? The word is E-J-E-C-T, so positions: E at 1 and 3? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\nIt might be acceptable, but let\'s avoid uncommon letters.\n\nBetter to use more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: E in position 2. For example, ""LEMON"", but L, E, M, O, N. But E is at position 2.\n\nBut we don\'t know if L, M, O, N are in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""BETEL"", ""DEVON"", etc.\n\nBut let\'s think of a word that uses common letters and has E in a position we haven\'t tested (i.e., not position 5).\n\nIn ""RAISE"", E was at position 5. Now we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nI think position 1 or 2 might be good.\n\nAlso, we should include other vowels if possible, but we know A and I are out, so the only vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y. But E is already in, so we might have O or U.\n\nCommon consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.\n\nLet me try to form a word: How about ""TOUCH""? But no E, and we must include E because we know it\'s in the word? Actually, we don\'t have to, but it would be wasteful not to use the information we have.\n\nWe know E is in the word, so we should include E in the new guess to find its position.\n\nSo, the guess must include E, and not include R, A, I, S.\n\nAlso, it should be a valid English word.\n\nLet me think of words with E in position 1: \n- ""E"", then common: L, O, T, N, etc.\n  ""ELOPE"": E, L, O, P, E. But E at the end again? We know E is not at position 5, so if we put E at the end, it will be misplaced again, which doesn\'t help us locate E. So better to avoid position 5 for E.\n\nTherefore, for this guess, we should not put E at position 5.\n\nSo, E should be in positions 1,2,3, or 4, but not 5.\n\nIn ""ELOPE"", E is at 1 and 5. We can use it, but the E at 5 will be wrong, and we already know that, so it might be a waste of a letter.\n\nBetter to have E only once and in a new position.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid words with E at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, words with E only in positions 1-4.\n\nFor example:\n- Position 1: ""ELBOW"", ""ENDOW"", ""EXPEL"" (but X is rare), ""EJECT"" (J is rare), ""EMPTY"" (M, P, T, Y)\n- Position 2: ""LEMON"", ""BELOW"", ""DECOY"", ""FETID"", ""GEODE"" (uncommon)\n- Position 3: ""OVATE"" (but O, V, A, T, E; A is absent, so invalid), ""INCUR"" (has I and R, absent), so need to avoid absent letters.\n  ""OPTER"" (has R, absent), not good.\n  ""BUTTE"" (B, U, T, T, E; E at end, which we avoid)\n  ""CUBED"" (C, U, B, E, D; E at position 4) -> good, but we don\'t know about C, U, B, D.\n\nSimilarly, position 4: ""PLUME"" (P, L, U, M, E; E at end, avoid), ""CRUDE"" (C, R, U, D, E; R absent, and E at end).\n\nIt\'s tricky.\n\nLet\'s list some candidate words:\n\n1. ""ELBOW"": E (pos1), L, B, O, W. No E at end. Letters: E, L, B, O, W. All new and common enough.\n2. ""ENDOW"": E (pos1), N, D, O, W. Similar.\n3. ""BELOW"": B, E (pos2), L, O, W. E at position 2.\n4. ""LEMON"": L, E (pos2), M, O, N.\n5. ""CUBED"": C, U, B, E (pos4), D. E at position 4, which is new.\n6. ""HOMED"": H, O, M, E (pos4), D. E at position 4.\n\nAmong these, ""BELOW"" seems good: B, E, L, O, W. Common letters, E at position 2.\n\n""LEMON"" is also good: L, E, M, O, N.\n\nBut ""LEMON"" has M and N, which are common.\n\nAnother one: ""TOUPE"" - but E at end, avoid.\n\n""POULE"" - obscure.\n\nI think ""BELOW"" or ""LEMON"" are fine.\n\nBut we also want to cover more common letters. T is very common, so perhaps a word with T.\n\nFor example, ""BETEL"" but E at position 2 and 4? ""BETEL"": B, E, T, E, L. But two E\'s, and L. But we don\'t know if double E is possible.\n\n""FETID"": F, E, T, I, D. But I is absent, so invalid.\n\nCannot use I.\n\n""METRO"" but has R, absent.\n\n""TEPID"" has I and is not allowed.\n\n""DEUCE"": D, E, U, C, E. E at position 2 and 5. Position 5 is bad, so avoid.\n\n""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T. E at position 4. V is less common.\n\nPerhaps ""THYME"": T, H, Y, M, E. E at end, avoid.\n\n""CHIME"" has I.\n\nSo, it\'s hard to avoid E at the end sometimes.\n\nBut we can use a word with E at position 3 or 4.\n\nFor example, ""OWLED"" - not common.\n\n""BOXED"": B, O, X, E, D. E at position 4. X is uncommon.\n\n""JOKED"" - J uncommon.\n\n""LOBED"": L, O, B, E, D. E at position 4. Letters: L, O, B, E, D. All new and reasonable.\n\nSimilarly, ""LUBED"" - same.\n\n""LOBED"" is a word? LOBED means having lobes, like in biology.\n\nSimilarly, ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D. E at position 4. T, O, N, D are common.\n\n""TONED"" seems good: T, O, N, E, D. E at position 4.\n\nWe haven\'t tested T, O, N, D yet.\n\nSimilarly, ""CONED"" but C, O, N, E, D. Also good.\n\nBut ""TONED"" is more common.\n\nAnother one: ""HOPED"" has H, O, P, E, D. E at position 4.\n\nBut T is more common than H or P.\n\nSo ""TONED"" might be better.\n\nBut let\'s compare to ""BELOW"": ""BELOW"" has B, E, L, O, W. E at position 2.\n\n""TONED"" has T, O, N, E, D. E at position 4.\n\nBoth introduce new common letters.\n\nWe know E is in the word, so by placing E in different positions, we can get information about its location.\n\nIn ""RAISE"", E was at position 5 and was misplaced. Now, if in the new guess, E is at position 2 (like in ""BELOW"") and if it\'s correct, we get a ✓, or if misplaced, we know it\'s not at 2.\n\nSimilarly for position 4 in ""TONED"".\n\nSince we have no information, trying E in the middle might be good.\n\nI think both are reasonable. I\'ll go with ""BELOW"" because it has E in position 2, which is a common position for E, and it uses B, L, O, W which are good.\n\n""BELOW"" is a common word.\n\nAnother popular choice might be ""CLONE"" but has C, L, O, N, E. E at end, which we want to avoid. So not good.\n\n""MODEL"" has E at position 4? M, O, D, E, L. E at position 4. But L is included.\n\n""MODEL"" is good: M, O, D, E, L. E at position 4.\n\nBut ""BELOW"" has W, which is less common than T or N.\n\nPerhaps ""TENOR"" but has R and N, R is absent.\n\nNo.\n\n""BONEY"" - not common.\n\nI think ""BELOW"" is acceptable.\n\nTo include T, how about ""BETTY"" but has double T and Y, and no E? Not.\n\n""THEFT"" has E at position 3: T, H, E, F, T. But double T, and F and H are less common.\n\nNot ideal.\n\n""DEALT"" has A and E, but A is absent.\n\nSo, I think ""BELOW"" or ""TONED"".\n\nLet\'s choose ""TONED"" because T, O, N, D are very common, and E is at position 4, which is a position we haven\'t tested (in the first guess, E was at 5, now at 4).\n\nIn ""RAISE"", E was at 5, so testing position 4 is adjacent and might be likely.\n\nBut no strong reason.\n\nI\'ll go with ""TONED"".\n\nBut ""TONED"" has E at position 4. If the secret word has E at position 4, we get a ✓ for E. If not, we get - or x, but we know E is in the word, so if not at 4, it would be misplaced, telling us it\'s not at 4.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nAnother candidate: ""OUNCE"" has E at end, avoid.\n\n""ELUDE"": E at 1, L, U, D, E. E at end again, so avoid.\n\n""EXILE"" has I and X, not good.\n\nSo, ""TONED"" seems solid.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: T, O, N, E, D. All letters not excluded, and E at position 4.\n\nYes.\n\nWe could do ""NOTED"", which is similar: N, O, T, E, D. E at position 4. Same letters.\n\n""NOTED"" is more common than ""TONED""? Both are valid.\n\nI\'ll use ""NOTED"" for familiarity.\n\n""NOTED"": N, O, T, E, D.\n\nSo, second guess: ""NOTED"".\n\nBut we must not use R, A, I, S, which we aren\'t.\n\nSo, I think that\'s good.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, A, I, S are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.\n- E is present but misplaced (-), meaning it is in the secret word but not in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include E (since it is confirmed in the secret word) but not in position 5 (as it was misplaced there in ""RAISE"").\n- It must avoid R, A, I, S entirely.\n- To maximize information, use common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, O, N, D) and place E in a new position (1–4) to narrow down its location.\n\nA strong candidate is ""NOTED"":\n- It includes E in position 4 (a new position to test).\n- It introduces new common letters: T, O, N, D.\n- It is a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help:\n- Confirm if E is in position 4 (✓), or if misplaced (-), reveal another possible position.\n- Test T, O, N, D for presence/position.\n\n<guess>NOTED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: NOTED -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) D(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE\n- R: absent (x)\n- A: absent (x)\n- I: absent (x)\n- S: absent (x)\n- E: present but misplaced (-)\n\nGuess 2: NOTED\n- N: absent (x)\n- O: correct position (✓) at position 2 (since O is the second letter in ""NOTED"")\n- T: absent (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) at position 4 (since E is the fourth letter in ""NOTED"")\n- D: present but misplaced (-)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n\n1. The secret word contains the letter O in the second position (position 2).\n2. The secret word contains the letter E in the fourth position (position 4).\n3. The secret word contains the letter D, but not in the fifth position (since in ""NOTED"", D was at position 5 and is misplaced).\n4. The following letters are absent: R, A, I, S, N, T. So we can exclude these.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know E is present but not in position 5, and now we know it is in position 4.\n\nThe secret word has the form: _ O _ E _\n\nWe also know D is in the word but not at position 5. So D must be in one of the first three positions? But positions 2 and 4 are taken by O and E, so D must be in position 1 or 3.\n\nPositions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nPosition 2: O (fixed)\nPosition 4: E (fixed)\nPosition 5: cannot be D (since D was misplaced at position 5 in ""NOTED""), and also, we know from the first guess that E was not at position 5, which is consistent.\n\nSo D must be at position 1 or 3.\n\nAdditionally, we have no information about other letters.\n\nWe need to find a word that fits: _ O _ E _\n\nWith D in position 1 or 3, and the missing letters must not be R, A, I, S, N, T.\n\nAlso, we have used: R, A, I, S, E, N, O, T, D. So available letters are the rest of the alphabet.\n\nAvailable letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we need common letters.\n\nNow, the word must have D in it, at position 1 or 3.\n\nCase 1: D at position 1 -> D O _ E _\nCase 2: D at position 3 -> _ O D E _\n\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters not excluded.\n\nAlso, since D is misplaced at position 5, it must be in the word but not at 5, which is satisfied as long as it\'s at 1 or 3.\n\nNow, let\'s think of possible words.\n\nFirst, if D is at position 1: ""DO _ E _""\n\nPossible words: DOZEN, DOGES, DOGMA, etc.\n\nBut DOZEN: Z is not very common, and we have N excluded? N is absent, so cannot use N. DOZEN has N, which is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, DOGES: G, E, S. But S is excluded, so no.\n\nDOGMA: G, M, A. A is excluded.\n\nDOWSE: W, S, E. S excluded.\n\nDOPEY: P, E, Y. But E is already at position 4, and Y is possible. But ""DOPEY"" has E at position 4? D O P E Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:P, 4:E, 5:Y. But we have E at position 4, which is correct, and O at 2 correct. D is at position 1, which is new. But we need to check if D is allowed at position 1? The feedback said D is misplaced at position 5, but it can be at position 1. However, in ""DOPEY"", the fifth letter is Y, not D, so that\'s fine. But we must not use excluded letters. Excluded: R,A,I,S,N,T. So P and Y are allowed.\n\nBut is ""DOPEY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning sleepy or dazed.\n\nBut let\'s see if it fits: secret word has O at 2, E at 4, and D must be present. In ""DOPEY"", D is at 1, so it should be present. But the feedback for D in guess 2 was misplaced, meaning D is in the word but not at position 5. In ""DOPEY"", D is at 1, so it\'s fine.\n\nBut we have to make sure about the other letters.\n\nIn ""DOPEY"", we have P at position 3 and Y at position 5.\n\nNow, second case: D at position 3: _ O D E _\n\nPossible words: BODED, BODES, CODED, CODEC, CODER, CODES, GODET, HODAD, JODEL, LODEN, LODES, MODEM, MODER, MODES, NODES, RODEO, RODES, WODGE, YODEL, etc.\n\nBut we have exclusions: R,A,I,S,N,T are absent. So we cannot have words with these.\n\nFor example, BODED: B, O, D, E, D. But D repeated? And E at 4. But N is not in it? BODED has B, O, D, E, D. Letters: B, O, D, E. D repeated? The word is B-O-D-E-D, so positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:D. But we have D at position 3 and 5. But in our feedback, D is present, but we don\'t know if it can be repeated. However, in the first guess, we had no repeated letters, but the secret word might have duplicates.\n\nBut in the feedback for ""NOTED"", D was at position 5 and was misplaced, meaning that at least one D is in the word, but not at position 5. If the word has two D\'s, it could have one at position 5, but the feedback says D is misplaced at position 5, which would imply that D is not at position 5, even if there are multiple. So position 5 cannot be D. Therefore, in ""BODED"", position 5 is D, which would be incorrect, but the word has D at position 3 as well. However, the feedback for ""NOTED"" said D is present but not at position 5, so if we guess a word with D at position 5, it would be marked as misplaced if there is another D, or absent if no other D? But in standard Wordle, if a letter is in the word multiple times, the feedback can be tricky.\n\nTo avoid complexity, let\'s assume for now that the secret word has only one D, since we have no evidence of duplicates. But it might have.\n\nBut in ""BODED"", if we guess it, and the secret word has only one D, then position 5 D would be absent if D is at position 3, but we know D is in the word, so it might be marked as misplaced if the position is wrong, but since position 5 is not correct, and D is present elsewhere, it would be marked as misplaced for position 5? I think I need to recall the rules.\n\nStandard Wordle feedback: for each position, if the letter is correct, green; if the letter is in the word but in wrong position, yellow; if not in word, gray. If there are multiple, it can be yellow for one and gray for another if the count is exceeded.\n\nBut in this case, for ""NOTED"", D at position 5 was yellow, meaning D is in the word but not at position 5. So the secret word has at least one D, and position 5 is not D.\n\nIf the secret word has only one D, then in a guess, if we put D at position 5, it should be yellow only if there is another D? No, if we put D at position 5 and the secret word has D only at, say, position 1, then position 5 D should be yellow (since D is in the word but not here). But if the secret word has no D at all, it would be gray. But we know D is in the word, so if we put D at position 5, it should be yellow, because D is present but not at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, if we put D at a position where it is not, but D is in the word, it should be yellow.\n\nBack to the point.\n\nFor the secret word, we have positions 2 and 4 fixed: O and E.\n\nPosition 1 and 3 and 5 to fill, with D in position 1 or 3.\n\nAlso, position 5 cannot be D.\n\nNow, from the list, with exclusions.\n\nFirst, D at position 1: ""DO _ E _""\n\nPossible words: DOGES, but S excluded.\n\nDOGMA, A excluded.\n\nDOWSE, S excluded.\n\nDOPEY: D O P E Y. P and Y are allowed. And no excluded letters. So ""DOPEY"" is a candidate.\n\nOther: DOVEN? Not common.\n\nDOZED, but Z and D repeated? DOZED: D O Z E D. D at 1 and 5. But position 5 is D, which we know cannot be D because in ""NOTED"" D at 5 was misplaced, so position 5 is not D. Therefore, ""DOZED"" would have D at 5, which is invalid for the secret word. So not.\n\nSimilarly, ""DOPEY"" has Y at 5, not D.\n\nNow, D at position 3: "" _ O D E _""\n\nPossible words: BODED, but has D at 5, which is invalid.\n\nBODES: B O D E S, but S excluded.\n\nCODES: C O D E S, S excluded.\n\nMODES: M O D E S, S excluded.\n\nRODEO: R O D E O, but R excluded, and O repeated? R O D E O, positions: 1:R (excluded), 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:O. O is at position 2 and 5, but we have O at position 2 fixed, so position 5 could be O? But in this word, it has two O\'s. But R is excluded, so invalid.\n\nYODEL: Y O D E L. Letters: Y, O, D, E, L. O at 2, E at 4. D at 3. Position 5 is L. No excluded letters. So ""YODEL"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, WODGE: W O D G E, but E is at position 5? W O D G E -> positions: 1:W, 2:O, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. But we have E at position 4 fixed, but here E is at 5, so not matching. Secret word has E at position 4, so position 4 must be E. In ""WODGE"", position 4 is G, not E, so it doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nWe need position 4 to be E.\n\nSimilarly, MODEM: M O D E M. Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:M. So this fits: _ O D E _ with M at 1 and 5. And no excluded letters. M is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, CODEC: C O D E C. C at 1 and 5.\n\nBut CODEC might be considered a tech word, but it\'s valid.\n\nHODAD: H O D A D, but A excluded.\n\nJODEL: similar to YODEL, but J is less common.\n\nLODEN: L O D E N, but N excluded.\n\nSo possible candidates: \n- D at 1: ""DOPEY"" (D O P E Y)\n- D at 3: ""YODEL"" (Y O D E L) or ""MODEM"" (M O D E M) or ""CODEC"" (C O D E C)\n\nWe need to choose one for the guess.\n\nWe also have to consider that in ""DOPEY"", D is at position 1, and in ""YODEL"", D is at position 3. We don\'t know which is correct, so we need to test.\n\nMoreover, we have other positions to fill.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word that tests letters we haven\'t used.\n\nWe have used: R,A,I,S,E,N,O,T,D. So available: B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nIn the candidates:\n- ""DOPEY"": uses P and Y\n- ""YODEL"": uses Y, D, E, L (but D and E are known, so new are Y and L)\n- ""MODEM"": uses M and M (repeated)\n- ""CODEC"": uses C and C (repeated)\n\n""MODEM"" has M at position 1 and 5, so it tests M in two positions.\n\nSimilarly, ""CODEC"" has C at 1 and 5.\n\nBut repeated letters might give less information.\n\n""YODEL"" has Y, O, D, E, L. O and E are known, so we are testing Y at 1, D at 3, and L at 5.\n\nSince D is already known to be present, we are mainly testing the position of D and the new letters Y and L.\n\nSimilarly, ""DOPEY"" tests D at 1, P at 3, Y at 5.\n\nWe don\'t know if P, Y, L, M, C are in the word.\n\nAnother candidate: what about ""HOMED""? But in ""HOMED"": H, O, M, E, D. But we have O at 2, E at 4, so it would be H O M E D. But position 5 is D, and we know D is not at position 5, so if we guess ""HOMED"", position 5 D would be yellow (misplaced), but we already know that. Also, position 1 is H, position 3 is M.\n\nBut ""HOMED"" has D at 5, which is not allowed in the secret word, so it cannot be the secret word because position 5 cannot be D. So we shouldn\'t guess a word that has D at position 5, as it\'s invalid for the secret word.\n\nSimilarly, any word with D at position 5 is not possible for the secret word.\n\nSo back to candidates without D at 5.\n\nAnother possibility: ""BOXED"" but has X and E at 4? B O X E D, but position 5 is D, invalid.\n\n""LOBED"": L O B E D, position 5 D, invalid.\n\nSo only the candidates I listed.\n\n""MOVED"": M O V E D, position 5 D, invalid.\n\nSo I think the main candidates are ""DOPEY"", ""YODEL"", ""MODEM"", ""CODEC"".\n\n""MODEM"" and ""CODEC"" have repeated letters, which might not be ideal for getting new information.\n\n""YODEL"" and ""DOPEY"" have all unique letters.\n\n""YODEL"" has L, which is common.\n\n""DOPEY"" has P and Y.\n\nY is less common than L or P.\n\nPerhaps ""YODEL"" is better.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are other words.\n\nWhat about ""JOWEL""? But J, and E at 4? J O W E L, positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:L. So it fits, and no D? But we need D in the word. The secret word must contain D, so if we guess ""JOWEL"", it doesn\'t have D, which would be bad because we know D is in the word, so we should include D to confirm or test its position.\n\nSimilarly, we must include D in the guess because it\'s a known letter.\n\nSo we cannot guess a word without D.\n\nTherefore, ""DOPEY"" or ""YODEL"" or ""MODEM"" etc.\n\nAnother word: ""GODET"" - a term in sewing, but obscure.\n\n""BOWED"": B O W E D, but position 5 D, invalid.\n\n""COWED"": C O W E D, position 5 D, invalid.\n\nSo I think ""DOPEY"" or ""YODEL"" are the best.\n\nNow, to decide: in ""DOPEY"", D is at position 1, which is a possibility, and in ""YODEL"", D is at position 3.\n\nWe don\'t know which, so we need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps we can choose based on commonality or letter frequency.\n\nP is more common than Y, but L is common.\n\n""YODEL"" has L at position 5, which is a common consonant.\n\nI think both are reasonable.\n\nSince in ""NOTED"" D was at position 5 and misplaced, and position 1 and 3 are open, we can try D at position 1.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nPerhaps we can choose a word that has more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""MOPED"" but has E at 4? M O P E D, position 5 D, invalid.\n\nNot possible.\n\n""LOPED"": L O P E D, position 5 D, invalid.\n\nSo no.\n\n""POKED"": P O K E D, position 5 D, invalid.\n\nTherefore, I think ""DOPEY"" is a good choice.\n\n""DOZEY"" but Z and Y, and N not, but no N, but Z is rare.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""DOPEY"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: secret word is _ O _ E _\n\nWith ""DOPEY"": D O P E Y, so if correct, position 1: D, 2: O, 3: P, 4: E, 5: Y.\n\nWe know O and E are correct, so we would get feedback on D, P, Y.\n\nIf D is correct at position 1, it should be green; if not, yellow or gray, but we know D is in the word, so if not at 1, it must be at 3, so it would be yellow if at 3, or if not, but we know it\'s in the word, so if not at 1, it must be at 3, so it should be yellow for position 1 if D is at 3.\n\nSimilarly for P and Y.\n\nBut we might solve it.\n\n""YODEL"": Y O D E L, position 1:Y, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:L.\n\nIf D is at position 3, it would be green; if at position 1, it would be yellow for position 3? If D is at position 1, then in ""YODEL"", position 3 D would be yellow if D is at 1, but position 1 Y might be something else.\n\nBut we can try.\n\nI think for the guess, we can choose ""YODEL"" to test D at position 3.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency.\n\nPerhaps we can list all possible words from the dictionary.\n\nBut since I don\'t have the full dictionary, I\'ll go with common words.\n\nAnother common word: ""HOMER"" but R excluded.\n\n""COVER"" R excluded.\n\n""BOXER"" R and X.\n\nNot.\n\nI think ""YODEL"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nBut Y is not very common, so perhaps ""MODEM"" is better, but repeated M.\n\n""MODEM"" is common in tech.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""YODEL"".\n\nTo avoid Y, is there a word with more common letters?\n\nWhat about ""LOBED"" but position 5 D invalid.\n\n""POLED"": P O L E D, position 5 D invalid.\n\n""FOYER"": F O Y E R, but R excluded.\n\nNot.\n\n""GONEF"" not a word.\n\nI think ""DOPEY"" or ""YODEL"" are the options.\n\nI\'ll go with ""YODEL"" as it has L, which is common.\n\nSo guess: ""YODEL""\n\nBut in ""YODEL"", position 3 is D, so if D is not at position 3, we get information.\n\nSimilarly, position 1 is Y, position 5 is L.\n\nSo it should be informative.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)  \n  This means:  \n  - R, A, I, S are absent from the secret word.  \n  - E is present but not in position 5.  \n\n- **Guess 2: NOTED** → Feedback: N(x), O(✓), T(x), E(✓), D(-)  \n  This means:  \n  - N and T are absent.  \n  - O is correct and in position 2.  \n  - E is correct and in position 4.  \n  - D is present but not in position 5.  \n\n### Key Inferences:\n- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ O _ E _` (O in position 2, E in position 4).  \n- D is in the word but not in position 5. Since positions 2 and 4 are fixed, D must be in position 1 or 3.  \n- Absent letters (excluded from guesses): R, A, I, S, N, T.  \n- Known present letters: O (position 2), E (position 4), D (position unknown, but not 5).  \n- Available letters for new guesses: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since R, A, I, S, N, T are excluded).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- The goal is to test the position of D (position 1 or 3) and introduce new common letters to gather more information.  \n- A strong candidate is **YODEL**:  \n  - Fits the pattern `_ O _ E _` with Y in position 1, O in position 2 (fixed), D in position 3, E in position 4 (fixed), and L in position 5.  \n  - Tests D in position 3: If D is correct here, it will be confirmed (✓). If not, it may be misplaced (indicating D is in position 1).  \n  - Introduces new common letters: Y (position 1) and L (position 5), which are untested and could provide valuable feedback.  \n  - Avoids excluded letters and is a valid English word.  \n\nThis guess will help narrow down the possibilities significantly by:  \n- Confirming or ruling out D in position 3.  \n- Testing Y and L for presence/position.  \n- Reducing the remaining letter pool for positions 1, 3, and 5.\n\n<guess>YODEL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: NOTED -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) D(-)\nGuess 3: YODEL -> FEEDBACK: Y(x) O(✓) D(-) E(✓) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: absent (x)
- A: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)
- E: present but misplaced (-) [so E is in the word, but not at position 5]

Guess 2: NOTED
- N: absent (x)
- O: correct position (✓) at position 2
- T: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 4
- D: present but misplaced (-) [so D is in the word, but not at position 5]

Guess 3: YODEL
- Y: absent (x)
- O: correct position (✓) at position 2 (as before)
- D: present but misplaced (-) [so D is in the word, but not at position 3 (since in YODEL, D is at position 3)]
- E: correct position (✓) at position 4 (as before)
- L: correct position (✓) at position 5

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has the form: _ O _ E L
   - Position 2: O (fixed)
   - Position 4: E (fixed)
   - Position 5: L (fixed)  [from YODEL feedback, L is correct at position 5]

2. Position 1 and 3 are unknown.

3. Known absent letters: R, A, I, S, N, T, Y (from the x's)

4. We know D is in the word but not at position 5 (from NOTED) and not at position 3 (from YODEL, since D was at position 3 and got a ""-"", meaning it's not at position 3). Therefore, D must be at position 1 (the only remaining position).

   - Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Position 2: O (fixed)
   - Position 3: cannot be D (because in YODEL, D at 3 was misplaced)
   - Position 4: E (fixed)
   - Position 5: L (fixed)
   - Position 1: must be D? But we have to check.

   However, we also know from NOTED that D is not at position 5, which is consistent. Since D is not at position 3 or 5, and positions 2 and 4 are fixed, the only possibility is position 1.

   Therefore, the secret word must have D at position 1.

   So the word is: D O _ E L

5. Now, we need to find the letter for position 3.

   The letter at position 3 must not be any of the absent letters: R, A, I, S, N, T, Y.

   Also, we have used: D, O, E, L, and the absent letters.

   Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

   But we need a common English word.

   The word is ""D O _ E L"". What words fit this pattern?

   Common words:
   - DOVEL? Not a word.
   - DOPEL? Not a word.
   - DOGEL? Not a word.
   - DOWEL: D O W E L -> This is a valid word (a type of pin).

   Also, ""DOWEL"" has W at position 3.

   Other possibilities?
   - DOXEL? Not common.
   - DOMEL? Not a word.
   - DODEL? Not a word.

   Another one: ""MODEL"" but M is at position 1, but we need D at position 1.

   ""HOTEL"" has H at 1, not D.

   So ""DOWEL"" seems a strong candidate.

   But let's confirm the letters: D, O, W, E, L.

   W is not excluded, and we haven't tested W before.

   Also, in the feedback, we have no information about W, so it could be present.

   Are there other words? For example, ""DOTAL"" but position 4 is A, not E, and we have E fixed at 4.

   ""DOZEL""? Not a word.

   ""DOVEL"" is not standard.

   ""DOWEL"" is the most common.

   Another: ""DUPLE"" but that's 5 letters? D U P L E, which is D U P L E, not matching the pattern.

   So ""DOWEL"" is the only common word that fits: D O W E L.

   Therefore, the secret word is likely ""DOWEL"".

   But we need to make a guess. Since we have only one position left, and we can guess ""DOWEL"".

   However, to be thorough, let's see if there are other possibilities.

   What about ""DOGEL""? Not a word.

   ""DOBEL""? Not a word.

   ""DOCEL""? Not a word.

   ""DOWEL"" is the only common one.

   Also, note that in the first guess, E was misplaced in ""RAISE"" (position 5). In ""DOWEL"", E is at position 4, which is correct, and L at 5 is new. Also, in ""RAISE"", E was at 5 and was misplaced, which is consistent because now E is at 4.

   Similarly, D was misplaced at position 5 in ""NOTED"" and at position 3 in ""YODEL"", but in ""DOWEL"", D is at position 1, which is correct.

   So all feedback is consistent.

   Therefore, we can guess ""DOWEL"".

   But let's make sure about the feedback for YODEL: we had L as correct at position 5, so position 5 is L.

   And for the third position, we have to fill with a letter that makes a valid word.

   Since ""DOWEL"" is valid, and fits, we can use that.

   So the next guess is ""DOWEL"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, I have deduced the following:

### Key Inferences:
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 2: O (✓ from NOTED and YODEL)  
   - Position 4: E (✓ from NOTED and YODEL)  
   - Position 5: L (✓ from YODEL)  
   The secret word pattern is: `_ O _ E L`.

2. **D must be in position 1**:  
   - D is present (from NOTED: D(-)), but it is not in position 5 (NOTED feedback) and not in position 3 (YODEL: D(-) at position 3).  
   - Since positions 2, 4, and 5 are fixed, D must be in position 1.  
   The pattern is now: `D O _ E L`.

3. **Absent Letters (excluded)**:  
   R, A, I, S, N, T, Y (from all ""x"" feedback).  
   Available letters for position 3: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

4. **Valid Word Constraint**:  
   The only common English word fitting `D O _ E L` is **DOWEL** (with W in position 3).  
   - Alternatives like DOGEL, DOCEL, or DOVEL are invalid.  
   - W is not excluded and fits the pattern.

### Why DOWEL?
- Tests position 1 (D), position 3 (W), and confirms fixed positions (O, E, L).  
- Consistent with all feedback:  
  - E was misplaced in RAISE (position 5) but is now fixed at position 4.  
  - D was misplaced in NOTED (position 5) and YODEL (position 3), so position 1 is the only valid slot.  
  - L is fixed at position 5.

Guess 2: NOTED
- N: absent (x)
- O: correct position (✓) at position 2
- T: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 4
- D: present but misplaced (-) [so D is in the word, but not at position 5]

Guess 3: YODEL
- Y: absent (x)
- O: correct position (✓) at position 2 (as before)
- D: present but misplaced (-) [so D is in the word, but not at position 3 (since in YODEL, D is at position 3)]

   - Position 2: O (fixed)
   - Position 4: E (fixed)
   - Position 5: L (fixed)  [from YODEL feedback, L is correct at position 5]

2. Position 1 and 3 are unknown.

3. Known absent letters: R, A, I, S, N, T, Y (from the x's)

4. We know D is in the word but not at position 5 (from NOTED) and not at position 3 (from YODEL, since D was at position 3 and got a ""-"", meaning it's not at position 3). Therefore, D must be at position 1 (the only remaining position).

   - Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Position 2: O (fixed)
   - Position 3: cannot be D (because in YODEL, D at 3 was misplaced)
   - Position 4: E (fixed)
   - Position 5: L (fixed)
   - Position 1: must be D? But we have to check.

   However, we also know from NOTED that D is not at position 5, which is consistent. Since D is not at position 3 or 5, and positions 2 and 4 are fixed, the only possibility is position 1.

   So the word is: D O _ E L

5. Now, we need to find the letter for position 3.

   The letter at position 3 must not be any of the absent letters: R, A, I, S, N, T, Y.

   Other possibilities?
   - DOXEL? Not common.
   - DOMEL? Not a word.
   - DODEL? Not a word.

   Another one: ""MODEL"" but M is at position 1, but we need D at position 1.

   ""HOTEL"" has H at 1, not D.

   So ""DOWEL"" seems a strong candidate.

   But let's confirm the letters: D, O, W, E, L.

   W is not excluded, and we haven't tested W before.

   Also, in the feedback, we have no information about W, so it could be present.

   Are there other words? For example, ""DOTAL"" but position 4 is A, not E, and we have E fixed at 4.

   ""DOZEL""? Not a word.

   ""DOVEL"" is not standard.

   ""DOWEL"" is the most common.

   Another: ""DUPLE"" but that's 5 letters? D U P L E, which is D U P L E, not matching the pattern.

   ""DOCEL""? Not a word.

   ""DOWEL"" is the only common one.

   Also, note that in the first guess, E was misplaced in ""RAISE"" (position 5). In ""DOWEL"", E is at position 4, which is correct, and L at 5 is new. Also, in ""RAISE"", E was at 5 and was misplaced, which is consistent because now E is at 4.

   Similarly, D was misplaced at position 5 in ""NOTED"" and at position 3 in ""YODEL"", but in ""DOWEL"", D is at position 1, which is correct.

   So all feedback is consistent.

   Therefore, we can guess ""DOWEL"".

   But let's make sure about the feedback for YODEL: we had L as correct at position 5, so position 5 is L.

   And for the third position, we have to fill with a letter that makes a valid word.

2. **D must be in position 1**:  
   - D is present (from NOTED: D(-)), but it is not in position 5 (NOTED feedback) and not in position 3 (YODEL: D(-) at position 3).

   The pattern is now: `D O _ E L`.

3. **Absent Letters (excluded)**:
