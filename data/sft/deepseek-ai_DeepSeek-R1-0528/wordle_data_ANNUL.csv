We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
 - The letters are all distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A and N are in the word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 3 and 4 respectively).

Therefore, the secret word contains A and N, but not C, R, E.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, E.
- Contains A and N.
- The A cannot be in the 3rd position and the N cannot be in the 4th position.

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that A and N are in the word, so we can try to place them in different positions.

Possible positions for A: since it was in position 3 and was wrong, we can try A in positions 1,2,4,5.
Similarly, for N: it was in position 4 and was wrong, so we can try N in positions 1,2,3,5.

We might also want to include other common letters to get more feedback.

A good second guess might be ""PLANT"", but let's check:
- P, L, A, N, T.
But note: in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N in position 4. In ""plant"", A is in position 3 and N in position 4? 
Wait: 
- P (1), L (2), A (3), N (4), T (5). 
But we know that A cannot be in position 3 and N cannot be in position 4. So ""plant"" would put A and N in the same positions that were wrong before. That would not be efficient because we already know those positions are incorrect.

So we need a word that has A and N in different positions.

Let me try to think of words with A and N, avoiding C, R, E.

Some options:
- ""SNAIL"": S, N, A, I, L -> N is in position 2, A in position 3. But we know A cannot be in position 3? Actually, we don't know that A cannot be in position 3 for sure? Wait, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put A in position 3 again because it would be the same mistake. Similarly, N cannot be in position 4.

In ""SNAIL"":
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: N -> this is a new position for N (previously was in 4, now in 2)
- Position 3: A -> but we know A is not in position 3, so this would be a waste because we already know it's not there.

So we should avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

Another word: ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T
- A is in position 2 (new)
- N is in position 4 (same as before) -> but we know N is not in position 4, so we shouldn't put it there.

We need to avoid position 4 for N.

How about ""MANIA"": M, A, N, I, A -> but has two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But let's avoid for now.

Another idea: ""DAILY"" -> but doesn't have N.

We must include both A and N.

Let me try ""TANGY"": T, A, N, G, Y
- A is in position 2 (new)
- N is in position 3 (new) -> good, because we haven't tried N in position 3? Actually, in the first guess, N was in position 4, so position 3 is new for N.

But note: we also have to avoid the known absent letters: C, R, E.

""TANGY"" uses T, A, N, G, Y. None of C, R, E. So that's good.

Another option: ""SANDY"": S, A, N, D, Y
- A in position 2, N in position 3 -> both new positions? 
But wait, in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and now we are putting it in position 2? That's acceptable because we know it's not in 3, but we don't know about 2.

However, we also have to consider that we want to test new letters.

But note: we have two letters that we know are in the word (A and N) and we are using them, and three new letters (T, G, Y for ""TANGY"" or S, D, Y for ""SANDY"").

Another common word: ""PAINT"" but we saw N is in position 4 which is bad.

How about ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N
- A is in position 3 -> we know that's wrong, so we shouldn't do that.

We need to avoid position 3 for A and position 4 for N.

So let's list possible positions for A: 1,2,4,5
For N: 1,2,3,5

A word that satisfies:
- A not in 3, N not in 4.

Example: ""NASTY"": N, A, S, T, Y
- N in position 1 (new)
- A in position 2 (new)
- Avoids C, R, E.

This seems good.

Another: ""ANVIL"": A, N, V, I, L
- A in position 1, N in position 2 -> both new.

But we don't know if V is common.

Alternatively, ""ADMIN"" but has M and I, but note: A in position 1, D, M, I, N in position 5? 
Wait: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5) -> so N is in position 5, which is new.

But we are using A in position 1 and N in position 5.

We can also consider ""LAPIN"" (which is a word, meaning a rabbit) but might be obscure.

To maximize common letters, let's go with ""NASTY"" or ""SALON"".

""SALON"": S, A, L, O, N
- A in position 2 (new)
- N in position 5 (new) -> good.

But note: we have O, which is a vowel.

Another: ""PAYNN"" is not a word.

I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests new positions.

So, let's choose ""NASTY"".

But wait, in ""NASTY"", we have:
- N in position 1: we don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.
- A in position 2: testing.

We also get to test S, T, Y.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't put A and N at the beginning to test more letters? But we have to include them.

Another word: ""DIANA"" but has two A's and we don't know about duplicates.

But to be safe, let's avoid duplicates for now.

I think ""NASTY"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word.

So, second guess: ""NASTY""

We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

But let me confirm: 
- We are including A and N, which we know are present.
- We are avoiding C, R, E.
- We are testing A in a new position (2) and N in a new position (1) and also testing S, T, Y.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we could use ""PAINT"" but that has N in position 4 which we know is wrong, so that would be inefficient because we already know N is not in position 4. So we shouldn't do that.

Similarly, we shouldn't put A in position 3.

So ""NASTY"" seems good.

Another option: ""BANAL"" -> B, A, N, A, L -> duplicate A? And A is in position 2 and 4? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, N is in position 3.

In ""BANAL"": 
- A in position 2 (new) and 4 (new) -> but we are only required to have at least one A and one N. However, if the word has only one A, then one of these would be wrong. But we are testing.

But it's more complex. So for simplicity, let's avoid duplicates.

Therefore, I choose ""NASTY"".

But wait, what about ""SNAKY""? S, N, A, K, Y -> N in position 2, A in position 3. But we cannot put A in position 3. So that's invalid.

So ""NASTY"" is better.

Final decision: ""NASTY""
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A and N are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"" for positions 3 and 4, respectively).

For the second guess:
- Must include A and N, but avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N.
- Exclude C, R, and E entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, Y) and new positions for A and N to maximize information.

The word ""NASTY"" fits these criteria:
- Places N in position 1 (new position, not tested before).
- Places A in position 2 (new position, avoiding position 3).
- Introduces S, T, and Y (new letters not yet tested).
- Avoids C, R, E.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and N while providing feedback on three additional letters.

But note: in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N in position 4. In ""plant"", A is in position 3 and N in position 4? 
Wait: 
- P (1), L (2), A (3), N (4), T (5). 
But we know that A cannot be in position 3 and N cannot be in position 4. So ""plant"" would put A and N in the same positions that were wrong before. That would not be efficient because we already know those positions are incorrect.

So we need a word that has A and N in different positions.

Let me try to think of words with A and N, avoiding C, R, E.

Some options:
- ""SNAIL"": S, N, A, I, L -> N is in position 2, A in position 3. But we know A cannot be in position 3? Actually, we don't know that A cannot be in position 3 for sure? Wait, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put A in position 3 again because it would be the same mistake. Similarly, N cannot be in position 4.

In ""SNAIL"":
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: N -> this is a new position for N (previously was in 4, now in 2)
- Position 3: A -> but we know A is not in position 3, so this would be a waste because we already know it's not there.

So we should avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

Another word: ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T
- A is in position 2 (new)
- N is in position 4 (same as before) -> but we know N is not in position 4, so we shouldn't put it there.

We need to avoid position 4 for N.

How about ""MANIA"": M, A, N, I, A -> but has two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But let's avoid for now.

Another idea: ""DAILY"" -> but doesn't have N.

We must include both A and N.

Let me try ""TANGY"": T, A, N, G, Y
- A is in position 2 (new)
- N is in position 3 (new) -> good, because we haven't tried N in position 3? Actually, in the first guess, N was in position 4, so position 3 is new for N.

But note: we also have to avoid the known absent letters: C, R, E.

""TANGY"" uses T, A, N, G, Y. None of C, R, E. So that's good.

Another option: ""SANDY"": S, A, N, D, Y
- A in position 2, N in position 3 -> both new positions? 
But wait, in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and now we are putting it in position 2? That's acceptable because we know it's not in 3, but we don't know about 2.

However, we also have to consider that we want to test new letters.

But note: we have two letters that we know are in the word (A and N) and we are using them, and three new letters (T, G, Y for ""TANGY"" or S, D, Y for ""SANDY"").

Another common word: ""PAINT"" but we saw N is in position 4 which is bad.

How about ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N
- A is in position 3 -> we know that's wrong, so we shouldn't do that.

We need to avoid position 3 for A and position 4 for N.

So let's list possible positions for A: 1,2,4,5
For N: 1,2,3,5

A word that satisfies:
- A not in 3, N not in 4.

Example: ""NASTY"": N, A, S, T, Y
- N in position 1 (new)
- A in position 2 (new)
- Avoids C, R, E.

This seems good.

Another: ""ANVIL"": A, N, V, I, L
- A in position 1, N in position 2 -> both new.

But we don't know if V is common.

Alternatively, ""ADMIN"" but has M and I, but note: A in position 1, D, M, I, N in position 5? 
Wait: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5) -> so N is in position 5, which is new.

But we are using A in position 1 and N in position 5.

We can also consider ""LAPIN"" (which is a word, meaning a rabbit) but might be obscure.

To maximize common letters, let's go with ""NASTY"" or ""SALON"".

""SALON"": S, A, L, O, N
- A in position 2 (new)
- N in position 5 (new) -> good.

But note: we have O, which is a vowel.

Another: ""PAYNN"" is not a word.

I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests new positions.

So, let's choose ""NASTY"".

But wait, in ""NASTY"", we have:
- N in position 1: we don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.
- A in position 2: testing.

We also get to test S, T, Y.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't put A and N at the beginning to test more letters? But we have to include them.

Another word: ""DIANA"" but has two A's and we don't know about duplicates.

But to be safe, let's avoid duplicates for now.

I think ""NASTY"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word.

So, second guess: ""NASTY""

We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

But let me confirm: 
- We are including A and N, which we know are present.
- We are avoiding C, R, E.
- We are testing A in a new position (2) and N in a new position (1) and also testing S, T, Y.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we could use ""PAINT"" but that has N in position 4 which we know is wrong, so that would be inefficient because we already know N is not in position 4. So we shouldn't do that.

Similarly, we shouldn't put A in position 3.

So ""NASTY"" seems good.

Another option: ""BANAL"" -> B, A, N, A, L -> duplicate A? And A is in position 2 and 4? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, N is in position 3.

In ""BANAL"": 
- A in position 2 (new) and 4 (new) -> but we are only required to have at least one A and one N. However, if the word has only one A, then one of these would be wrong. But we are testing.

But it's more complex. So for simplicity, let's avoid duplicates.

Therefore, I choose ""NASTY"".

But wait, what about ""SNAKY""? S, N, A, K, Y -> N in position 2, A in position 3. But we cannot put A in position 3. So that's invalid.

So ""NASTY"" is better.

Final decision: ""NASTY""After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A and N are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"" for positions 3 and 4, respectively).

For the second guess:
- Must include A and N, but avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N.
- Exclude C, R, and E entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, Y) and new positions for A and N to maximize information.

The word ""NASTY"" fits these criteria:
- Places N in position 1 (new position, not tested before).
- Places A in position 2 (new position, avoiding position 3).
- Introduces S, T, and Y (new letters not yet tested).
- Avoids C, R, E.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and N while providing feedback on three additional letters.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
- N: - (in word, wrong position) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 4
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""nasty""
- N: - (in word, wrong position) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 1 (since we guessed it at position 1 and it's wrong there)
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 2 (since we guessed it at position 2 and it's wrong there)
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- Y: x (not in word)

Now, combining the information:

Absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, Y. So we must avoid these letters: C, R, E, S, T, Y.

Present letters (but position unknown): A and N.

From guess 1, we know A is not at position 3 and N is not at position 4.
From guess 2, we know A is not at position 2 and N is not at position 1.

So for A, it cannot be in positions 2 or 3. Therefore, A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly, for N, it cannot be in positions 1 or 4. Therefore, N must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must contain both A and N (and no other letters from the absent list).

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 tries left.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Includes A and N (since they are present, and we haven't placed them yet)
- Avoids C, R, E, S, T, Y.
- Tries A in one of the possible positions: 1, 4, 5
- Tries N in one of the possible positions: 2, 3, 5 (but note: if we put both A and N in position 5, that's impossible, so we have to assign different positions)

Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.

Available letters: all letters except C, R, E, S, T, Y. So we can use: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. But note A and N are already known to be in the word, so we must include them.

We should form a word that has A and N, and three new letters from the available set.

Possible positions for A: 1,4,5
Possible positions for N: 2,3,5

But note: position 5 can only hold one letter, so if we put A at 5, then N cannot be at 5, and vice versa.

We can consider:

Option 1: A at position 1, then N at position 2, 3, or 5.
Option 2: A at position 4, then N at position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4, which is already taken by A? Wait, no: A is at 4, so N can be at 2,3,5).
Option 3: A at position 5, then N at position 2 or 3 (since 5 is taken).

Similarly, we can start with N.

We also want to cover as many new positions as possible and use common letters.

Let's try to think of words that fit.

First, if we put A at position 1 and N at position 2: then the word starts with ""AN"". Then we need three more letters. For example: ""ANVIL"" but V and I are not very common, and we have to avoid S,T,Y, etc.

But let's list:

- ""ANVIL"": A(1), N(2), V(3), I(4), L(5) -> but we have A at 1 (which is allowed) and N at 2 (allowed). But we are testing V, I, L.

But is ""ANVIL"" a word? Yes.

But we might have better options.

Another: ""ANGEL"" -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E.

E is in the absent list.

Another: ""ANKLE"" -> E is absent.

Avoid E.

""ANODE"" -> E absent.

So without E, what words start with ""AN""?

""ANGRY"" -> but Y is absent.

Y is absent.

""ANKHS"" -> not common, and S is absent.

""ANIMA"" -> has two A's? A(1), N(2), I(3), M(4), A(5). But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But we can try.

But let's see if we can avoid duplicates for now.

Another: ""ANVIL"" as above.

But we also have the possibility of A at 1 and N at 3: so ""A?N??"". For example, ""PLANE"" -> but E absent and P and L are new? But E is absent, so invalid.

""BLAND"" -> B, L, A, N, D? But A is at position 3? We are considering A at 1? No, for A at 1 and N at 3: so first letter A, third letter N.

Example: ""ADMIN"" -> A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5). But here N is at 5, which is allowed. But we are putting A at 1 and N at 5.

In this case, we are testing positions: A at 1 (which we haven't tried) and N at 5 (which we haven't tried for N? In the first guess, N was at 4, in the second at 1, so 5 is new).

But we also have the constraint that A cannot be at 2 or 3, and N cannot be at 1 or 4.

In ""ADMIN"": A at 1 (ok), N at 5 (ok). And we test D, M, I.

But is ""ADMIN"" a word? Yes, short for administrator.

Another option: A at 4 and N at 2: so ""?N?A?"".

For example: ""UNMAN"" -> U, N, M, A, N -> but has two N's? And A at 4. But we don't know about duplicates.

""INLAY"" -> but Y absent.

""ONLAY"" -> same.

""FINAL"" -> F, I, N, A, L -> N at position 3, A at position 4? But we are considering A at 4 and N at 2? Not matching.

If we want N at 2 and A at 4: then the word is ? N ? A ?

For example: ""UNFAD"" not a word.

""BNAGA"" not a word.

""INLAW"" -> I, N, L, A, W -> N at 2, A at 4. And avoids absent letters. So ""INLAW"" is a word? It might be considered a word (meaning a person who is related by marriage).

But let's see if we can find more common words.

Another: ""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> but A at 1 and 5? And N at 3. But we are considering A at 1 and N at 3? That's one option.

But ""MANIA"" has two A's.

We could try A at 5 and N at 2: so ""? N ? ? A""

For example: ""UNICA"" not a word.

""ONCIA"" not common.

""INCRA"" not a word.

""INGLE"" has E.

It might be hard.

Another idea: A at 5 and N at 3: so ""? ? N ? A""

For example: ""PENNA"" -> but E is absent.

""MINKA"" -> M, I, N, K, A -> N at 3, A at 5. And letters: M, I, N, K, A. None of the absent letters. So ""MINKA"" is a word? It might be (a type of fur or a place). But let's see if we can find a more common word.

""LINDA"" -> but L, I, N, D, A -> N at 3, A at 5. And avoids absent letters. ""LINDA"" is a common name, so it should be acceptable.

Similarly, ""MINDA"" might not be as common.

But ""LINDA"" has L, I, N, D, A.

We also have the option of A at 4 and N at 3: but N at 3 is allowed, A at 4 is allowed? But we need to check if we have tried these positions.

For A: we have tried position 3 (in crane) and 2 (in nasty), so 4 is new.
For N: we have tried 4 (in crane) and 1 (in nasty), so 3 is new.

So ""? ? N A ?""

For example: ""BONAFIDE"" too long. 5 letters: ""DONAH"" not common.

""FINAL"" we thought earlier: F, I, N, A, L -> N at 3, A at 4. And F, I, L are new.

""FINAL"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""VINAL"" not common.

So between ""ADMIN"", ""INLAW"", ""LINDA"", ""FINAL"", etc.

We need to choose one that uses common letters and tests new positions.

But note: in ""FINAL"", we are putting A at position 4 and N at position 3. Both are new positions for these letters.

Similarly, in ""LINDA"", A at 5 and N at 3.

We also want to cover more of the alphabet.

Let's list the letters we have not tried at all: from the available set, we have used A, N (but not placed), and in the first two guesses we used C,R,E,S,T,Y (absent) and the others not.

In first guess: C,R,A,N,E
Second guess: N,A,S,T,Y

So we have tried: A, C, E, N, R, S, T, Y.

So new letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We should try to include some of these to get more information.

In ""FINAL"": F, I, N, A, L -> F, I, L are new.

In ""ADMIN"": A, D, M, I, N -> D, M, I are new.

In ""LINDA"": L, I, N, D, A -> L, I, D are new.

All are good.

But note: we have 3 positions to fill with new letters.

We might also consider the frequency of letters.

Common consonants: L, D, M, etc.

Vowels: we have A already, so we might try I or O.

But we don't know if there are other vowels.

Since we have only two known letters (A and N) and the word has 5 letters, there are three more letters to discover.

We should try a word that has A and N in the allowed positions and three new letters.

I think ""FINAL"" is a good candidate because:
- It places N in position 3 (new) and A in position 4 (new)
- It uses F, I, L which are common and not tried.

Similarly, ""ADMIN"" is good too.

But let's see the position constraints again: for N, position 3 is allowed (since we haven't tried it and it's not forbidden). For A, position 4 is allowed.

In ""FINAL"", we have:
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: N -> we are testing N in position 3 (which is allowed because we only know it's not in 1 or 4, so 3 is possible)
- Position 4: A -> testing A in position 4 (allowed because we know it's not in 2 or 3, so 4 is possible)
- Position 5: L

If the feedback shows that N is not in 3 or A not in 4, then we eliminate those positions.

If they are correct, we get them right.

Either way, we get information.

Similarly, if we choose ""ADMIN"": A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5. Then we test A at 1 and N at 5.

But we have to see which one is better.

We have two possible strategies:
1. Test A and N in positions that are possible but not yet tested, so we can confirm or eliminate.
2. Test new letters.

In ""FINAL"", we test two new positions for A and N (3 and 4) and three new letters.

In ""ADMIN"", we test two new positions (1 for A and 5 for N) and three new letters.

Both are similar.

But note: in ""ADMIN"", we are putting A at position 1, which is the first position. We haven't tested A at 1 before, so it's good.

Similarly, in ""FINAL"", A at 4 and N at 3.

I think both are reasonable.

But let's consider that in the first guess, A was at 3 and N at 4, which are adjacent. In ""FINAL"", we are putting N at 3 and A at 4, which is swapping them. That might be a good test because if they were swapped, it would be correct.

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we might avoid that because if the word has A and N in adjacent positions, but we don't know the order.

But it's a valid test.

I think I'll go with ""FINAL"" because it's a very common word.

So, guess: ""FINAL""

But let's double-check the constraints:
- A must not be in 2 or 3: in ""FINAL"", A is in 4, which is not 2 or 3 -> ok.
- N must not be in 1 or 4: in ""FINAL"", N is in 3, which is not 1 or 4 -> ok.
- Absent letters: C,R,E,S,T,Y are not used -> ok.
- Uses new letters: F, I, L.

So, it should be fine.

If we get feedback, we can proceed.

Therefore, the third guess is ""FINAL"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent Letters**: C, R, E, S, T, Y (must be avoided).
- **Present Letters**: A and N are in the word but not in the positions tried:
  - A is not in position 2 or 3 (from ""nasty"" and ""crane"" feedback).
  - N is not in position 1 or 4 (from ""nasty"" and ""crane"" feedback).
- **Possible Positions**:
  - A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - N must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but cannot share position 5 with A).

For the next guess:
- Must include A and N in new positions to test possibilities.
- Use new letters to gather more information (avoiding C, R, E, S, T, Y).
- ""FINAL"" is chosen because:
  - Places A in position 4 (a new position to test, since A cannot be in 2 or 3).
  - Places N in position 3 (a new position to test, since N cannot be in 1 or 4).
  - Introduces new letters: F, I, L (not previously tested).
  - Avoids all absent letters.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and N while testing three new letters.

<guess>final</guess>",final,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
- N: - (in word, wrong position) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 4
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""nasty""
- N: - (in word, wrong position) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 1 (since we guessed it at position 1 and it's wrong there)
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 2 (since we guessed it at position 2 and it's wrong there)
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- Y: x (not in word)

Now, combining the information:

Absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, Y. So we must avoid these letters: C, R, E, S, T, Y.

Present letters (but position unknown): A and N.

From guess 1, we know A is not at position 3 and N is not at position 4.
From guess 2, we know A is not at position 2 and N is not at position 1.

So for A, it cannot be in positions 2 or 3. Therefore, A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly, for N, it cannot be in positions 1 or 4. Therefore, N must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must contain both A and N (and no other letters from the absent list).

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 tries left.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Includes A and N (since they are present, and we haven't placed them yet)
- Avoids C, R, E, S, T, Y.
- Tries A in one of the possible positions: 1, 4, 5
- Tries N in one of the possible positions: 2, 3, 5 (but note: if we put both A and N in position 5, that's impossible, so we have to assign different positions)

Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.

Available letters: all letters except C, R, E, S, T, Y. So we can use: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. But note A and N are already known to be in the word, so we must include them.

We should form a word that has A and N, and three new letters from the available set.

Possible positions for A: 1,4,5
Possible positions for N: 2,3,5

But note: position 5 can only hold one letter, so if we put A at 5, then N cannot be at 5, and vice versa.

We can consider:

Option 1: A at position 1, then N at position 2, 3, or 5.
Option 2: A at position 4, then N at position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4, which is already taken by A? Wait, no: A is at 4, so N can be at 2,3,5).
Option 3: A at position 5, then N at position 2 or 3 (since 5 is taken).

Similarly, we can start with N.

We also want to cover as many new positions as possible and use common letters.

Let's try to think of words that fit.

First, if we put A at position 1 and N at position 2: then the word starts with ""AN"". Then we need three more letters. For example: ""ANVIL"" but V and I are not very common, and we have to avoid S,T,Y, etc.

But let's list:

- ""ANVIL"": A(1), N(2), V(3), I(4), L(5) -> but we have A at 1 (which is allowed) and N at 2 (allowed). But we are testing V, I, L.

But is ""ANVIL"" a word? Yes.

But we might have better options.

Another: ""ANGEL"" -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E.

E is in the absent list.

Another: ""ANKLE"" -> E is absent.

Avoid E.

""ANODE"" -> E absent.

So without E, what words start with ""AN""?

""ANGRY"" -> but Y is absent.

Y is absent.

""ANKHS"" -> not common, and S is absent.

""ANIMA"" -> has two A's? A(1), N(2), I(3), M(4), A(5). But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But we can try.

But let's see if we can avoid duplicates for now.

Another: ""ANVIL"" as above.

But we also have the possibility of A at 1 and N at 3: so ""A?N??"". For example, ""PLANE"" -> but E absent and P and L are new? But E is absent, so invalid.

""BLAND"" -> B, L, A, N, D? But A is at position 3? We are considering A at 1? No, for A at 1 and N at 3: so first letter A, third letter N.

Example: ""ADMIN"" -> A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5). But here N is at 5, which is allowed. But we are putting A at 1 and N at 5.

In this case, we are testing positions: A at 1 (which we haven't tried) and N at 5 (which we haven't tried for N? In the first guess, N was at 4, in the second at 1, so 5 is new).

But we also have the constraint that A cannot be at 2 or 3, and N cannot be at 1 or 4.

In ""ADMIN"": A at 1 (ok), N at 5 (ok). And we test D, M, I.

But is ""ADMIN"" a word? Yes, short for administrator.

Another option: A at 4 and N at 2: so ""?N?A?"".

For example: ""UNMAN"" -> U, N, M, A, N -> but has two N's? And A at 4. But we don't know about duplicates.

""INLAY"" -> but Y absent.

""ONLAY"" -> same.

""FINAL"" -> F, I, N, A, L -> N at position 3, A at position 4? But we are considering A at 4 and N at 2? Not matching.

If we want N at 2 and A at 4: then the word is ? N ? A ?

For example: ""UNFAD"" not a word.

""BNAGA"" not a word.

""INLAW"" -> I, N, L, A, W -> N at 2, A at 4. And avoids absent letters. So ""INLAW"" is a word? It might be considered a word (meaning a person who is related by marriage).

But let's see if we can find more common words.

Another: ""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> but A at 1 and 5? And N at 3. But we are considering A at 1 and N at 3? That's one option.

But ""MANIA"" has two A's.

We could try A at 5 and N at 2: so ""? N ? ? A""

For example: ""UNICA"" not a word.

""ONCIA"" not common.

""INCRA"" not a word.

""INGLE"" has E.

It might be hard.

Another idea: A at 5 and N at 3: so ""? ? N ? A""

For example: ""PENNA"" -> but E is absent.

""MINKA"" -> M, I, N, K, A -> N at 3, A at 5. And letters: M, I, N, K, A. None of the absent letters. So ""MINKA"" is a word? It might be (a type of fur or a place). But let's see if we can find a more common word.

""LINDA"" -> but L, I, N, D, A -> N at 3, A at 5. And avoids absent letters. ""LINDA"" is a common name, so it should be acceptable.

Similarly, ""MINDA"" might not be as common.

But ""LINDA"" has L, I, N, D, A.

We also have the option of A at 4 and N at 3: but N at 3 is allowed, A at 4 is allowed? But we need to check if we have tried these positions.

For A: we have tried position 3 (in crane) and 2 (in nasty), so 4 is new.
For N: we have tried 4 (in crane) and 1 (in nasty), so 3 is new.

So ""? ? N A ?""

For example: ""BONAFIDE"" too long. 5 letters: ""DONAH"" not common.

""FINAL"" we thought earlier: F, I, N, A, L -> N at 3, A at 4. And F, I, L are new.

""FINAL"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""VINAL"" not common.

So between ""ADMIN"", ""INLAW"", ""LINDA"", ""FINAL"", etc.

We need to choose one that uses common letters and tests new positions.

But note: in ""FINAL"", we are putting A at position 4 and N at position 3. Both are new positions for these letters.

Similarly, in ""LINDA"", A at 5 and N at 3.

We also want to cover more of the alphabet.

Let's list the letters we have not tried at all: from the available set, we have used A, N (but not placed), and in the first two guesses we used C,R,E,S,T,Y (absent) and the others not.

In first guess: C,R,A,N,E
Second guess: N,A,S,T,Y

So we have tried: A, C, E, N, R, S, T, Y.

So new letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We should try to include some of these to get more information.

In ""FINAL"": F, I, N, A, L -> F, I, L are new.

In ""ADMIN"": A, D, M, I, N -> D, M, I are new.

In ""LINDA"": L, I, N, D, A -> L, I, D are new.

All are good.

But note: we have 3 positions to fill with new letters.

We might also consider the frequency of letters.

Common consonants: L, D, M, etc.

Vowels: we have A already, so we might try I or O.

But we don't know if there are other vowels.

Since we have only two known letters (A and N) and the word has 5 letters, there are three more letters to discover.

We should try a word that has A and N in the allowed positions and three new letters.

I think ""FINAL"" is a good candidate because:
- It places N in position 3 (new) and A in position 4 (new)
- It uses F, I, L which are common and not tried.

Similarly, ""ADMIN"" is good too.

But let's see the position constraints again: for N, position 3 is allowed (since we haven't tried it and it's not forbidden). For A, position 4 is allowed.

In ""FINAL"", we have:
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: N -> we are testing N in position 3 (which is allowed because we only know it's not in 1 or 4, so 3 is possible)
- Position 4: A -> testing A in position 4 (allowed because we know it's not in 2 or 3, so 4 is possible)
- Position 5: L

If the feedback shows that N is not in 3 or A not in 4, then we eliminate those positions.

If they are correct, we get them right.

Either way, we get information.

Similarly, if we choose ""ADMIN"": A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5. Then we test A at 1 and N at 5.

But we have to see which one is better.

We have two possible strategies:
1. Test A and N in positions that are possible but not yet tested, so we can confirm or eliminate.
2. Test new letters.

In ""FINAL"", we test two new positions for A and N (3 and 4) and three new letters.

In ""ADMIN"", we test two new positions (1 for A and 5 for N) and three new letters.

Both are similar.

But note: in ""ADMIN"", we are putting A at position 1, which is the first position. We haven't tested A at 1 before, so it's good.

Similarly, in ""FINAL"", A at 4 and N at 3.

I think both are reasonable.

But let's consider that in the first guess, A was at 3 and N at 4, which are adjacent. In ""FINAL"", we are putting N at 3 and A at 4, which is swapping them. That might be a good test because if they were swapped, it would be correct.

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we might avoid that because if the word has A and N in adjacent positions, but we don't know the order.

But it's a valid test.

I think I'll go with ""FINAL"" because it's a very common word.

So, guess: ""FINAL""

But let's double-check the constraints:
- A must not be in 2 or 3: in ""FINAL"", A is in 4, which is not 2 or 3 -> ok.
- N must not be in 1 or 4: in ""FINAL"", N is in 3, which is not 1 or 4 -> ok.
- Absent letters: C,R,E,S,T,Y are not used -> ok.
- Uses new letters: F, I, L.

So, it should be fine.

If we get feedback, we can proceed.

Therefore, the third guess is ""FINAL"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent Letters**: C, R, E, S, T, Y (must be avoided).
- **Present Letters**: A and N are in the word but not in the positions tried:
  - A is not in position 2 or 3 (from ""nasty"" and ""crane"" feedback).
  - N is not in position 1 or 4 (from ""nasty"" and ""crane"" feedback).
- **Possible Positions**:
  - A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - N must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but cannot share position 5 with A).

For the next guess:
- Must include A and N in new positions to test possibilities.
- Use new letters to gather more information (avoiding C, R, E, S, T, Y).
- ""FINAL"" is chosen because:
  - Places A in position 4 (a new position to test, since A cannot be in 2 or 3).
  - Places N in position 3 (a new position to test, since N cannot be in 1 or 4).
  - Introduces new letters: F, I, L (not previously tested).
  - Avoids all absent letters.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and N while testing three new letters.",Guess 3: final -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(x) N(✓) A(-) L(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,ANNUL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
 - The letters are all distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A and N are in the word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 3 and 4 respectively).

Therefore, the secret word contains A and N, but not C, R, E.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, R, E.
- Contains A and N.
- The A cannot be in the 3rd position and the N cannot be in the 4th position.

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that A and N are in the word, so we can try to place them in different positions.

Possible positions for A: since it was in position 3 and was wrong, we can try A in positions 1,2,4,5.
Similarly, for N: it was in position 4 and was wrong, so we can try N in positions 1,2,3,5.

We might also want to include other common letters to get more feedback.

A good second guess might be ""PLANT"", but let's check:
- P, L, A, N, T.
But note: in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N in position 4. In ""plant"", A is in position 3 and N in position 4? 
Wait: 
- P (1), L (2), A (3), N (4), T (5). 
But we know that A cannot be in position 3 and N cannot be in position 4. So ""plant"" would put A and N in the same positions that were wrong before. That would not be efficient because we already know those positions are incorrect.

So we need a word that has A and N in different positions.

Let me try to think of words with A and N, avoiding C, R, E.

Some options:
- ""SNAIL"": S, N, A, I, L -> N is in position 2, A in position 3. But we know A cannot be in position 3? Actually, we don't know that A cannot be in position 3 for sure? Wait, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put A in position 3 again because it would be the same mistake. Similarly, N cannot be in position 4.

In ""SNAIL"":
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: N -> this is a new position for N (previously was in 4, now in 2)
- Position 3: A -> but we know A is not in position 3, so this would be a waste because we already know it's not there.

So we should avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

Another word: ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T
- A is in position 2 (new)
- N is in position 4 (same as before) -> but we know N is not in position 4, so we shouldn't put it there.

We need to avoid position 4 for N.

How about ""MANIA"": M, A, N, I, A -> but has two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But let's avoid for now.

Another idea: ""DAILY"" -> but doesn't have N.

We must include both A and N.

Let me try ""TANGY"": T, A, N, G, Y
- A is in position 2 (new)
- N is in position 3 (new) -> good, because we haven't tried N in position 3? Actually, in the first guess, N was in position 4, so position 3 is new for N.

But note: we also have to avoid the known absent letters: C, R, E.

""TANGY"" uses T, A, N, G, Y. None of C, R, E. So that's good.

Another option: ""SANDY"": S, A, N, D, Y
- A in position 2, N in position 3 -> both new positions? 
But wait, in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and now we are putting it in position 2? That's acceptable because we know it's not in 3, but we don't know about 2.

However, we also have to consider that we want to test new letters.

But note: we have two letters that we know are in the word (A and N) and we are using them, and three new letters (T, G, Y for ""TANGY"" or S, D, Y for ""SANDY"").

Another common word: ""PAINT"" but we saw N is in position 4 which is bad.

How about ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N
- A is in position 3 -> we know that's wrong, so we shouldn't do that.

We need to avoid position 3 for A and position 4 for N.

So let's list possible positions for A: 1,2,4,5
For N: 1,2,3,5

A word that satisfies:
- A not in 3, N not in 4.

Example: ""NASTY"": N, A, S, T, Y
- N in position 1 (new)
- A in position 2 (new)
- Avoids C, R, E.

This seems good.

Another: ""ANVIL"": A, N, V, I, L
- A in position 1, N in position 2 -> both new.

But we don't know if V is common.

Alternatively, ""ADMIN"" but has M and I, but note: A in position 1, D, M, I, N in position 5? 
Wait: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5) -> so N is in position 5, which is new.

But we are using A in position 1 and N in position 5.

We can also consider ""LAPIN"" (which is a word, meaning a rabbit) but might be obscure.

To maximize common letters, let's go with ""NASTY"" or ""SALON"".

""SALON"": S, A, L, O, N
- A in position 2 (new)
- N in position 5 (new) -> good.

But note: we have O, which is a vowel.

Another: ""PAYNN"" is not a word.

I think ""NASTY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests new positions.

So, let's choose ""NASTY"".

But wait, in ""NASTY"", we have:
- N in position 1: we don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.
- A in position 2: testing.

We also get to test S, T, Y.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't put A and N at the beginning to test more letters? But we have to include them.

Another word: ""DIANA"" but has two A's and we don't know about duplicates.

But to be safe, let's avoid duplicates for now.

I think ""NASTY"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word.

So, second guess: ""NASTY""

We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

But let me confirm: 
- We are including A and N, which we know are present.
- We are avoiding C, R, E.
- We are testing A in a new position (2) and N in a new position (1) and also testing S, T, Y.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we could use ""PAINT"" but that has N in position 4 which we know is wrong, so that would be inefficient because we already know N is not in position 4. So we shouldn't do that.

Similarly, we shouldn't put A in position 3.

So ""NASTY"" seems good.

Another option: ""BANAL"" -> B, A, N, A, L -> duplicate A? And A is in position 2 and 4? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, N is in position 3.

In ""BANAL"": 
- A in position 2 (new) and 4 (new) -> but we are only required to have at least one A and one N. However, if the word has only one A, then one of these would be wrong. But we are testing.

But it's more complex. So for simplicity, let's avoid duplicates.

Therefore, I choose ""NASTY"".

But wait, what about ""SNAKY""? S, N, A, K, Y -> N in position 2, A in position 3. But we cannot put A in position 3. So that's invalid.

So ""NASTY"" is better.

Final decision: ""NASTY""After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A and N are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"" for positions 3 and 4, respectively).

For the second guess:
- Must include A and N, but avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N.
- Exclude C, R, and E entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, Y) and new positions for A and N to maximize information.

The word ""NASTY"" fits these criteria:
- Places N in position 1 (new position, not tested before).
- Places A in position 2 (new position, avoiding position 3).
- Introduces S, T, and Y (new letters not yet tested).
- Avoids C, R, E.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and N while providing feedback on three additional letters.

<guess>nasty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(-) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
- N: - (in word, wrong position) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 4
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""nasty""
- N: - (in word, wrong position) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 1 (since we guessed it at position 1 and it's wrong there)
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 2 (since we guessed it at position 2 and it's wrong there)
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- Y: x (not in word)

Now, combining the information:

Absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, Y. So we must avoid these letters: C, R, E, S, T, Y.

Present letters (but position unknown): A and N.

From guess 1, we know A is not at position 3 and N is not at position 4.
From guess 2, we know A is not at position 2 and N is not at position 1.

So for A, it cannot be in positions 2 or 3. Therefore, A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly, for N, it cannot be in positions 1 or 4. Therefore, N must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must contain both A and N (and no other letters from the absent list).

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 tries left.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Includes A and N (since they are present, and we haven't placed them yet)
- Avoids C, R, E, S, T, Y.
- Tries A in one of the possible positions: 1, 4, 5
- Tries N in one of the possible positions: 2, 3, 5 (but note: if we put both A and N in position 5, that's impossible, so we have to assign different positions)

Additionally, we want to test new letters to get more information.

Available letters: all letters except C, R, E, S, T, Y. So we can use: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. But note A and N are already known to be in the word, so we must include them.

We should form a word that has A and N, and three new letters from the available set.

Possible positions for A: 1,4,5
Possible positions for N: 2,3,5

But note: position 5 can only hold one letter, so if we put A at 5, then N cannot be at 5, and vice versa.

We can consider:

Option 1: A at position 1, then N at position 2, 3, or 5.
Option 2: A at position 4, then N at position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4, which is already taken by A? Wait, no: A is at 4, so N can be at 2,3,5).
Option 3: A at position 5, then N at position 2 or 3 (since 5 is taken).

Similarly, we can start with N.

We also want to cover as many new positions as possible and use common letters.

Let's try to think of words that fit.

First, if we put A at position 1 and N at position 2: then the word starts with ""AN"". Then we need three more letters. For example: ""ANVIL"" but V and I are not very common, and we have to avoid S,T,Y, etc.

But let's list:

- ""ANVIL"": A(1), N(2), V(3), I(4), L(5) -> but we have A at 1 (which is allowed) and N at 2 (allowed). But we are testing V, I, L.

But is ""ANVIL"" a word? Yes.

But we might have better options.

Another: ""ANGEL"" -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E.

E is in the absent list.

Another: ""ANKLE"" -> E is absent.

Avoid E.

""ANODE"" -> E absent.

So without E, what words start with ""AN""?

""ANGRY"" -> but Y is absent.

Y is absent.

""ANKHS"" -> not common, and S is absent.

""ANIMA"" -> has two A's? A(1), N(2), I(3), M(4), A(5). But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But we can try.

But let's see if we can avoid duplicates for now.

Another: ""ANVIL"" as above.

But we also have the possibility of A at 1 and N at 3: so ""A?N??"". For example, ""PLANE"" -> but E absent and P and L are new? But E is absent, so invalid.

""BLAND"" -> B, L, A, N, D? But A is at position 3? We are considering A at 1? No, for A at 1 and N at 3: so first letter A, third letter N.

Example: ""ADMIN"" -> A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5). But here N is at 5, which is allowed. But we are putting A at 1 and N at 5.

In this case, we are testing positions: A at 1 (which we haven't tried) and N at 5 (which we haven't tried for N? In the first guess, N was at 4, in the second at 1, so 5 is new).

But we also have the constraint that A cannot be at 2 or 3, and N cannot be at 1 or 4.

In ""ADMIN"": A at 1 (ok), N at 5 (ok). And we test D, M, I.

But is ""ADMIN"" a word? Yes, short for administrator.

Another option: A at 4 and N at 2: so ""?N?A?"".

For example: ""UNMAN"" -> U, N, M, A, N -> but has two N's? And A at 4. But we don't know about duplicates.

""INLAY"" -> but Y absent.

""ONLAY"" -> same.

""FINAL"" -> F, I, N, A, L -> N at position 3, A at position 4? But we are considering A at 4 and N at 2? Not matching.

If we want N at 2 and A at 4: then the word is ? N ? A ?

For example: ""UNFAD"" not a word.

""BNAGA"" not a word.

""INLAW"" -> I, N, L, A, W -> N at 2, A at 4. And avoids absent letters. So ""INLAW"" is a word? It might be considered a word (meaning a person who is related by marriage).

But let's see if we can find more common words.

Another: ""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> but A at 1 and 5? And N at 3. But we are considering A at 1 and N at 3? That's one option.

But ""MANIA"" has two A's.

We could try A at 5 and N at 2: so ""? N ? ? A""

For example: ""UNICA"" not a word.

""ONCIA"" not common.

""INCRA"" not a word.

""INGLE"" has E.

It might be hard.

Another idea: A at 5 and N at 3: so ""? ? N ? A""

For example: ""PENNA"" -> but E is absent.

""MINKA"" -> M, I, N, K, A -> N at 3, A at 5. And letters: M, I, N, K, A. None of the absent letters. So ""MINKA"" is a word? It might be (a type of fur or a place). But let's see if we can find a more common word.

""LINDA"" -> but L, I, N, D, A -> N at 3, A at 5. And avoids absent letters. ""LINDA"" is a common name, so it should be acceptable.

Similarly, ""MINDA"" might not be as common.

But ""LINDA"" has L, I, N, D, A.

We also have the option of A at 4 and N at 3: but N at 3 is allowed, A at 4 is allowed? But we need to check if we have tried these positions.

For A: we have tried position 3 (in crane) and 2 (in nasty), so 4 is new.
For N: we have tried 4 (in crane) and 1 (in nasty), so 3 is new.

So ""? ? N A ?""

For example: ""BONAFIDE"" too long. 5 letters: ""DONAH"" not common.

""FINAL"" we thought earlier: F, I, N, A, L -> N at 3, A at 4. And F, I, L are new.

""FINAL"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""VINAL"" not common.

So between ""ADMIN"", ""INLAW"", ""LINDA"", ""FINAL"", etc.

We need to choose one that uses common letters and tests new positions.

But note: in ""FINAL"", we are putting A at position 4 and N at position 3. Both are new positions for these letters.

Similarly, in ""LINDA"", A at 5 and N at 3.

We also want to cover more of the alphabet.

Let's list the letters we have not tried at all: from the available set, we have used A, N (but not placed), and in the first two guesses we used C,R,E,S,T,Y (absent) and the others not.

In first guess: C,R,A,N,E
Second guess: N,A,S,T,Y

So we have tried: A, C, E, N, R, S, T, Y.

So new letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We should try to include some of these to get more information.

In ""FINAL"": F, I, N, A, L -> F, I, L are new.

In ""ADMIN"": A, D, M, I, N -> D, M, I are new.

In ""LINDA"": L, I, N, D, A -> L, I, D are new.

All are good.

But note: we have 3 positions to fill with new letters.

We might also consider the frequency of letters.

Common consonants: L, D, M, etc.

Vowels: we have A already, so we might try I or O.

But we don't know if there are other vowels.

Since we have only two known letters (A and N) and the word has 5 letters, there are three more letters to discover.

We should try a word that has A and N in the allowed positions and three new letters.

I think ""FINAL"" is a good candidate because:
- It places N in position 3 (new) and A in position 4 (new)
- It uses F, I, L which are common and not tried.

Similarly, ""ADMIN"" is good too.

But let's see the position constraints again: for N, position 3 is allowed (since we haven't tried it and it's not forbidden). For A, position 4 is allowed.

In ""FINAL"", we have:
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: N -> we are testing N in position 3 (which is allowed because we only know it's not in 1 or 4, so 3 is possible)
- Position 4: A -> testing A in position 4 (allowed because we know it's not in 2 or 3, so 4 is possible)
- Position 5: L

If the feedback shows that N is not in 3 or A not in 4, then we eliminate those positions.

If they are correct, we get them right.

Either way, we get information.

Similarly, if we choose ""ADMIN"": A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5. Then we test A at 1 and N at 5.

But we have to see which one is better.

We have two possible strategies:
1. Test A and N in positions that are possible but not yet tested, so we can confirm or eliminate.
2. Test new letters.

In ""FINAL"", we test two new positions for A and N (3 and 4) and three new letters.

In ""ADMIN"", we test two new positions (1 for A and 5 for N) and three new letters.

Both are similar.

But note: in ""ADMIN"", we are putting A at position 1, which is the first position. We haven't tested A at 1 before, so it's good.

Similarly, in ""FINAL"", A at 4 and N at 3.

I think both are reasonable.

But let's consider that in the first guess, A was at 3 and N at 4, which are adjacent. In ""FINAL"", we are putting N at 3 and A at 4, which is swapping them. That might be a good test because if they were swapped, it would be correct.

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we might avoid that because if the word has A and N in adjacent positions, but we don't know the order.

But it's a valid test.

I think I'll go with ""FINAL"" because it's a very common word.

So, guess: ""FINAL""

But let's double-check the constraints:
- A must not be in 2 or 3: in ""FINAL"", A is in 4, which is not 2 or 3 -> ok.
- N must not be in 1 or 4: in ""FINAL"", N is in 3, which is not 1 or 4 -> ok.
- Absent letters: C,R,E,S,T,Y are not used -> ok.
- Uses new letters: F, I, L.

So, it should be fine.

If we get feedback, we can proceed.

Therefore, the third guess is ""FINAL"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent Letters**: C, R, E, S, T, Y (must be avoided).
- **Present Letters**: A and N are in the word but not in the positions tried:
  - A is not in position 2 or 3 (from ""nasty"" and ""crane"" feedback).
  - N is not in position 1 or 4 (from ""nasty"" and ""crane"" feedback).
- **Possible Positions**:
  - A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - N must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but cannot share position 5 with A).

For the next guess:
- Must include A and N in new positions to test possibilities.
- Use new letters to gather more information (avoiding C, R, E, S, T, Y).
- ""FINAL"" is chosen because:
  - Places A in position 4 (a new position to test, since A cannot be in 2 or 3).
  - Places N in position 3 (a new position to test, since N cannot be in 1 or 4).
  - Introduces new letters: F, I, L (not previously tested).
  - Avoids all absent letters.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and N while testing three new letters.

So we shouldn\'t do that.\n\nSimilarly, we shouldn\'t put A in position 3.\n\nSo ""NASTY"" seems good.\n\nAnother option: ""BANAL"" -> B, A, N, A, L -> duplicate A? And A is in position 2 and 4? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, N is in position 3.\n\nIn ""BANAL"": \n- A in position 2 (new) and 4 (new) -> but we are only required to have at least one A and one N. However, if the word has only one A, then one of these would be wrong. But we are testing.\n\nBut it\'s more complex. So for simplicity, let\'s avoid duplicates.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""NASTY"".\n\nBut wait, what about ""SNAKY""? S, N, A, K, Y -> N in position 2, A in position 3. But we cannot put A in position 3. So that\'s invalid.\n\nSo ""NASTY"" is better.\n\nFinal decision: ""NASTY""After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and E are not in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- A and N are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"" for positions 3 and 4, respectively).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include A and N, but avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N.\n- Exclude C, R, and E entirely.\n- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, Y) and new positions for A and N to maximize information.\n\nThe word ""NASTY"" fits these criteria:\n- Places N in position 1 (new position, not tested before).\n- Places A in position 2 (new position, avoiding position 3).\n- Introduces S, T, and Y (new letters not yet tested).\n- Avoids C, R, E.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of A and N while providing feedback on three additional letters.\n\n<guess>nasty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(-) S(x) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: x (not in word)\n- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3\n- N: - (in word, wrong position) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 4\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""nasty""\n- N: - (in word, wrong position) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 1 (since we guessed it at position 1 and it\'s wrong there)\n- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 2 (since we guessed it at position 2 and it\'s wrong there)\n- S: x (not in word)\n- T: x (not in word)\n- Y: x (not in word)\n\nNow, combining the information:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, E, S, T, Y.

But note A and N are already known to be in the word, so we must include them.\n\nWe should form a word that has A and N, and three new letters from the available set.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1,4,5\nPossible positions for N: 2,3,5\n\nBut note: position 5 can only hold one letter, so if we put A at 5, then N cannot be at 5, and vice versa.\n\nWe can consider:\n\nOption 1: A at position 1, then N at position 2, 3, or 5.\nOption 2: A at position 4, then N at position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4, which is already taken by A? Wait, no: A is at 4, so N can be at 2,3,5).\nOption 3: A at position 5, then N at position 2 or 3 (since 5 is taken).\n\nSimilarly, we can start with N.\n\nWe also want to cover as many new positions as possible and use common letters.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that fit.\n\nFirst, if we put A at position 1 and N at position 2: then the word starts with ""AN"". Then we need three more letters. For example: ""ANVIL"" but V and I are not very common, and we have to avoid S,T,Y, etc.\n\nBut let\'s list:\n\n- ""ANVIL"": A(1), N(2), V(3), I(4), L(5) -> but we have A at 1 (which is allowed) and N at 2 (allowed). But we are testing V, I, L.\n\nBut is ""ANVIL"" a word? Yes.\n\nBut we might have better options.\n\nAnother: ""ANGEL"" -> but E is absent, so we cannot use E.\n\nE is in the absent list.\n\nAnother: ""ANKLE"" -> E is absent.\n\nAvoid E.\n\n""ANODE"" -> E absent.\n\nSo without E, what words start with ""AN""?\n\n""ANGRY"" -> but Y is absent.\n\nY is absent.\n\n""ANKHS"" -> not common, and S is absent.\n\n""ANIMA"" -> has two A\'s? A(1), N(2), I(3), M(4), A(5). But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But we can try.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can avoid duplicates for now.\n\nAnother: ""ANVIL"" as above.\n\nBut we also have the possibility of A at 1 and N at 3: so ""A?N??"". For example, ""PLANE"" -> but E absent and P and L are new? But E is absent, so invalid.\n\n""BLAND"" -> B, L, A, N, D? But A is at position 3? We are considering A at 1? No, for A at 1 and N at 3: so first letter A, third letter N.\n\nExample: ""ADMIN"" -> A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5). But here N is at 5, which is allowed. But we are putting A at 1 and N at 5.\n\nIn this case, we are testing positions: A at 1 (which we haven\'t tried) and N at 5 (which we haven\'t tried for N? In the first guess, N was at 4, in the second at 1, so 5 is new).\n\nBut we also have the constraint that A cannot be at 2 or 3, and N cannot be at 1 or 4.\n\nIn ""ADMIN"": A at 1 (ok), N at 5 (ok). And we test D, M, I.\n\nBut is ""ADMIN"" a word? Yes, short for administrator.\n\nAnother option: A at 4 and N at 2: so ""?N?A?"".\n\nFor example: ""UNMAN"" -> U, N, M, A, N -> but has two N\'s? And A at 4. But we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\n""INLAY"" -> but Y absent.\n\n""ONLAY"" -> same.\n\n""FINAL"" -> F, I, N, A, L -> N at position 3, A at position 4? But we are considering A at 4 and N at 2? Not matching.\n\nIf we want N at 2 and A at 4: then the word is ? N ? A ?\n\nFor example: ""UNFAD"" not a word.\n\n""BNAGA"" not a word.\n\n""INLAW"" -> I, N, L, A, W -> N at 2, A at 4. And avoids absent letters. So ""INLAW"" is a word? It might be considered a word (meaning a person who is related by marriage).\n\nBut let\'s see if we can find more common words.\n\nAnother: ""MANIA"" -> M, A, N, I, A -> but A at 1 and 5? And N at 3. But we are considering A at 1 and N at 3? That\'s one option.\n\nBut ""MANIA"" has two A\'s.\n\nWe could try A at 5 and N at 2: so ""? N ? ? A""\n\nFor example: ""UNICA"" not a word.\n\n""ONCIA"" not common.\n\n""INCRA"" not a word.\n\n""INGLE"" has E.\n\nIt might be hard.\n\nAnother idea: A at 5 and N at 3: so ""? ? N ? A""\n\nFor example: ""PENNA"" -> but E is absent.\n\n""MINKA"" -> M, I, N, K, A -> N at 3, A at 5. And letters: M, I, N, K, A. None of the absent letters. So ""MINKA"" is a word? It might be (a type of fur or a place). But let\'s see if we can find a more common word.\n\n""LINDA"" -> but L, I, N, D, A -> N at 3, A at 5. And avoids absent letters. ""LINDA"" is a common name, so it should be acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, ""MINDA"" might not be as common.\n\nBut ""LINDA"" has L, I, N, D, A.\n\nWe also have the option of A at 4 and N at 3: but N at 3 is allowed, A at 4 is allowed? But we need to check if we have tried these positions.\n\nFor A: we have tried position 3 (in crane) and 2 (in nasty), so 4 is new.\nFor N: we have tried 4 (in crane) and 1 (in nasty), so 3 is new.\n\nSo ""? ? N A ?""\n\nFor example: ""BONAFIDE"" too long. 5 letters: ""DONAH"" not common.\n\n""FINAL"" we thought earlier: F, I, N, A, L -> N at 3, A at 4. And F, I, L are new.\n\n""FINAL"" is a common word.\n\nSimilarly, ""VINAL"" not common.\n\nSo between ""ADMIN"", ""INLAW"", ""LINDA"", ""FINAL"", etc.\n\nWe need to choose one that uses common letters and tests new positions.\n\nBut note: in ""FINAL"", we are putting A at position 4 and N at position 3. Both are new positions for these letters.\n\nSimilarly, in ""LINDA"", A at 5 and N at 3.\n\nWe also want to cover more of the alphabet.\n\nLet\'s list the letters we have not tried at all: from the available set, we have used A, N (but not placed), and in the first two guesses we used C,R,E,S,T,Y (absent) and the others not.\n\nIn first guess: C,R,A,N,E\nSecond guess: N,A,S,T,Y\n\nSo we have tried: A, C, E, N, R, S, T, Y.\n\nSo new letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nWe should try to include some of these to get more information.\n\nIn ""FINAL"": F, I, N, A, L -> F, I, L are new.\n\nIn ""ADMIN"": A, D, M, I, N -> D, M, I are new.\n\nIn ""LINDA"": L, I, N, D, A -> L, I, D are new.\n\nAll are good.\n\nBut note: we have 3 positions to fill with new letters.\n\nWe might also consider the frequency of letters.\n\nCommon consonants: L, D, M, etc.\n\nVowels: we have A already, so we might try I or O.\n\nBut we don\'t know if there are other vowels.\n\nSince we have only two known letters (A and N) and the word has 5 letters, there are three more letters to discover.\n\nWe should try a word that has A and N in the allowed positions and three new letters.\n\nI think ""FINAL"" is a good candidate because:\n- It places N in position 3 (new) and A in position 4 (new)\n- It uses F, I, L which are common and not tried.\n\nSimilarly, ""ADMIN"" is good too.\n\nBut let\'s see the position constraints again: for N, position 3 is allowed (since we haven\'t tried it and it\'s not forbidden). For A, position 4 is allowed.\n\nIn ""FINAL"", we have:\n- Position 1: F\n- Position 2: I\n- Position 3: N -> we are testing N in position 3 (which is allowed because we only know it\'s not in 1 or 4, so 3 is possible)\n- Position 4: A -> testing A in position 4 (allowed because we know it\'s not in 2 or 3, so 4 is possible)\n- Position 5: L\n\nIf the feedback shows that N is not in 3 or A not in 4, then we eliminate those positions.\n\nIf they are correct, we get them right.\n\nEither way, we get information.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose ""ADMIN"": A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5. Then we test A at 1 and N at 5.\n\nBut we have to see which one is better.\n\nWe have two possible strategies:\n1. Test A and N in positions that are possible but not yet tested, so we can confirm or eliminate.\n2. Test new letters.\n\nIn ""FINAL"", we test two new positions for A and N (3 and 4) and three new letters.\n\nIn ""ADMIN"", we test two new positions (1 for A and 5 for N) and three new letters.\n\nBoth are similar.\n\nBut note: in ""ADMIN"", we are putting A at position 1, which is the first position. We haven\'t tested A at 1 before, so it\'s good.\n\nSimilarly, in ""FINAL"", A at 4 and N at 3.\n\nI think both are reasonable.\n\nBut let\'s consider that in the first guess, A was at 3 and N at 4, which are adjacent. In ""FINAL"", we are putting N at 3 and A at 4, which is swapping them. That might be a good test because if they were swapped, it would be correct.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid that because if the word has A and N in adjacent positions, but we don\'t know the order.\n\nBut it\'s a valid test.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""FINAL"" because it\'s a very common word.\n\nSo, guess: ""FINAL""\n\nBut let\'s double-check the constraints:\n- A must not be in 2 or 3: in ""FINAL"", A is in 4, which is not 2 or 3 -> ok.\n- N must not be in 1 or 4: in ""FINAL"", N is in 3, which is not 1 or 4 -> ok.\n- Absent letters: C,R,E,S,T,Y are not used -> ok.\n- Uses new letters: F, I, L.\n\nSo, it should be fine.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can proceed.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""FINAL"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Absent Letters**: C, R, E, S, T, Y (must be avoided).\n- **Present Letters**: A and N are in the word but not in the positions tried:\n  - A is not in position 2 or 3 (from ""nasty"" and ""crane"" feedback).\n  - N is not in position 1 or 4 (from ""nasty"" and ""crane"" feedback).\n- **Possible Positions**:\n  - A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n  - N must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but cannot share position 5 with A).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include A and N in new positions to test possibilities.\n- Use new letters to gather more information (avoiding C, R, E, S, T, Y).\n- ""FINAL"" is chosen because:\n  - Places A in position 4 (a new position to test, since A cannot be in 2 or 3).\n  - Places N in position 3 (a new position to test, since N cannot be in 1 or 4).\n  - Introduces new letters: F, I, L (not previously tested).\n  - Avoids all absent letters.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of A and N while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>final</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(-) S(x) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: final -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(x) N(✓) A(-) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
Guess 2: ""nasty"" -> Feedback: N(-), A(-), S(x), T(x), Y(x)
Guess 3: ""final"" -> Feedback: F(x), I(x), N(✓), A(-), L(✓)

Let's analyze:

From all feedback:

Absent letters (marked x): C, R, E, S, T, Y, F, I. So these letters are not in the secret word at all.

Present letters:
- A: has been marked (-) in all three guesses, meaning it is in the word but never in the correct position. We have tried A in positions: 3 (crane), 2 (nasty), and 4 (final). Therefore, A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Since it must be in the word and not in those positions, the only possible positions left are 1 or 5.

- N: in guess 3, N is marked ✓ in position 3. Therefore, N is in the secret word and is fixed at position 3. This is confirmed by the feedback.

Additionally, from guess 3:
- L is marked ✓ in position 5. Therefore, L is in the secret word and fixed at position 5.

Now, N is at position 3 and L is at position 5.

Summary of knowns:
- Position 3: N (correct)
- Position 5: L (correct)
- A is present but not in positions 2,3,4 → must be in position 1. (Since position 3 is taken by N, and position 5 is taken by L, so A cannot be at 5? Wait, let's see: positions are 1 to 5. Position 3 and 5 are fixed. A must be in 1 or 5, but position 5 is L, so A must be at position 1.)

Therefore:
- Position 1 must be A. (Because we have only positions 1 and 5 possible for A, but position 5 is occupied by L, so A has to be at position 1.)

But wait, is that confirmed? Let's see: A must be in the word and we have tried positions 2,3,4 with (-), so only positions 1 or 5 are possible. Now, position 5 is L (as per the checkmark in guess 3), so L is fixed at position 5. Therefore, A must be at position 1.

So we have:
- Position 1: A
- Position 3: N
- Position 5: L

The secret word is of the form: A _ N _ L

Now, we need to guess the letters at position 2 and position 4.

We know the missing letters must be:
- Not any of the absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, Y, F, I (from all feedback so far).
- They must be letters not yet tried or from the present list.

But we also have two positions to fill, and we know no other present letters yet? Wait, only A, N, L are fixed, but there are two more letters.

Let's list all absent letters: from the feedback, absent are: C, E, R, S, T, Y, F, I.

So the remaining possible letters: B, D, G, H, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We have two positions: 2 and 4.

We also have to make sure the word is valid.

Moreover, in guess 3 (""final""), we had A at position 4 but it showed (-), meaning that in the secret word, A is present but not at position 4. We already deduced it must be at position 1.

Now, we need a 5-letter word starting with A, then some letter, then N, then some letter, ending with L.

So pattern: A * N * L

And the * positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

We can think of possible words: ANGEL? But E is absent, so invalid.
ANVIL? V is allowed, but we have L at the end, but ANVIL has V at position 4 and I at position 2? ANVIL: A, N, V, I, L. But I is absent (from feedback, I is x in guess 3), so I cannot be used. So ""ANVIL"" is invalid.

Possible words:

- ""ANIML"" not a word.

- ""ANNUL"": A, N, N, U, L → has two N's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, positions: A(1), N(3)? Wait, no: position 3 is N, but in ""ANNUL"", position 2 is N, position 3 is N? Actually, ""ANNUL"": positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:N, 4:U, 5:L. But we have position 3 fixed as N, so that's okay. But position 2 would also be N? But in the secret word, we have position 3: N and position 5: L, so ""ANNUL"" would have N at position 2 and 3? But we have N as fixed at position 3 only. The word might have duplicate N's.

But from feedback, we don't have any information about duplicates. However, in guess 3 (""final""), we had N at position 3 correct, and we didn't get any extra feedback about other N's? But that's normal.

But let's see: if the word had two N's, it wouldn't contradict.

Similarly, other letters.

Common words fitting A _ N _ L:

- ""ANKLE"": but E is absent.

- ""ANGEL"": E absent.

- ""ANVIL"": I absent.

- ""ANNUL"" as above.

- ""ANXIOUS"" too long.

5-letter: ""ANILS""? Not a word.

""ANALE"" not a word.

""ABAND"" not a word.

""ADMIN"" but we have M and I? I is absent.

""ADONL"" not a word.

Let's try with the available letters.

Possible: ""ANGRL"" no.

Another: ""AWNING"" too long.

Perhaps ""JUMPS"" doesn't fit.

Wait, common ones: ""ANMOL"" no.

I think of ""ANVIL"" but I is out.

What about ""ANNAL""? It means a record of events. ""ANNAL"": A, N, N, A, L? Positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L. Now, we have A at position 1 and 4? But we have constraint that A must be at position 1? And at position 4? But we also have position 4 is A? But in the pattern, we are putting A at position 1 and position 4? But in ""ANNAL"", it has two A's.

But our word must have A at position 1? And we have position 4 as the second letter? But in our case, we have position 3 as N, position 5 as L. So:

- Position 1: A → must be A? Yes, as deduced.
- Position 2: ? 
- Position 3: N → fixed.
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: L → fixed.

So ""ANNAL"" fits: A, N, N, A, L → but positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L. So it has A at position 4? But we have a problem: we deduced A must be at position 1, but if A is also at position 4, that's fine. However, in the feedback from guess 3 (""final""), we guessed A at position 4 and it showed (-), not (✓). That means in the secret word, A is not at position 4. So ""ANNAL"" would have A at position 4, but we got (-) for A at position 4, which implies that position 4 is not A. Therefore, ""ANNAL"" is invalid.

Similarly, any word with A at position 4 is invalid because we tried A at position 4 and it was wrong position (-), meaning it is not at 4.

But in our pattern, position 4 must be a different letter.

Back to possible: ""AUNTL"" not a word.

""ARUNL"" no.

""ALLOW"" doesn't have N at third.

List possible letters for position 2 and 4: from the available set: B, D, G, H, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words: ""AVIAN"" not matching pattern.

Word: A * N * L

Examples:
- ""ANNUL"" → A(1), N(2), N(3), U(4), L(5). This fits: positions match with N at 3 and L at 5? Wait: position 3 is N, which is fixed. But in ""ANNUL"", position 3 is the third letter which is the second N? Yes: ANNUL → 1:A, 2:N, 3:N, 4:U, 5:L. So position 3 is N (which is fixed) → okay. Position 5 is L → okay. And A at position 1 → okay.

We need to check if the letters are possible:
- Position 2: N → but we have no constraint on position 2 except that it cannot be absent letters. Is N allowed? N is already in the word, but duplicates are possible. And we haven't tried N at position 2? In previous guesses:
  - Guess 1: N was at position 4 → - (wrong position)
  - Guess 2: N was at position 1 → - (wrong position)
  - Guess 3: N at position 3 → ✓

So we haven't tried N at position 2. So it could be possible.

But note: if N is at position 2, then we have two N's: one at 2 and one at 3.

Is there any feedback against duplicates? No.

Similarly, U at position 4: U is available.

But we have absent letters? U not absent.

Also, L at 5 is fixed.

Does this word avoid absent letters? A, N, N, U, L → absent: C,R,E,S,T,Y,F,I not included → good.

Another word: ""ANOLE"" → but E is absent.

""ANGLO"" → G and O, but ends with O? Not L.

""ANKHS"" → S absent.

""AMNIO"" → not ending with L.

""ANNEX"" → E absent and X not? E absent.

Perhaps ""ANNUL"" is a candidate.

But are there others?

""BANAL"" but first letter A? Pattern is fixed first letter A.

""ANDAL"" not a word.

""MANOR"" not.

""ANYOL"" no.

Another: ""ANSWER"" too long.

Perhaps ""ANJUL"" not a word.

Maybe ""ADDLE"" doesn't have N at third.

Word ""UNDID"" not.

I think ""ANNUL"" is a possible word.

Another possibility: ""APPLE"" → P and P, but E absent and no N? Must have N at third.

No.

""ASSET"" S absent.

So perhaps ""ANNUL"" is the only common word? Or ""CANDY"" C absent.

Let's think: ""AWNED"" E absent.

""OUNCE"" E absent.

We need to fill position 2 and 4.

Possible combinations: e.g., A with D and G: ""ADNGL"" not a word.

With U: as in ""ANNUL"".

Another word: ""ANIMAL"" too long.

5-letter: ""ANHEL"" not a word.

""ARVAL"" but R absent.

So, ""ANNUL"" seems a valid option.

But we could also try ""MANUL"" but M at first? Pattern must start with A. ""MANUL"" starts with M.

No: our word must start with A.

So possible ""ANNUL"" or perhaps ""AZONL"" no.

""ANOMALY"" too long.

Moreover, we have to make a guess.

But we are not sure if duplicates are allowed.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" but doesn't end with L and no N at third? Must have N at position 3.

Position 3 must be N.

So ""A _ N _ L""

"" AUDIO"" → A,U,D,I,O → positions: 1:A, 2:U, 3:D? not N.

No.

""ALIGN"" → A,L,I,G,N → positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I? not N. And L at position 2, but our L is at position 5? Could be, but we have fixed L at position 5? No: in the word, position 5 must be L.

In ""ALIGN"", if we have N at position 5? But we need position 3 to be N.

So no.

Therefore, the only common word I can think of is ""ANNUL"": A, N, N, U, L.

We know U is available? Yes.

But in ""ANNUL"", position 2 is N, which we haven't tested.

And position 4 is U.

So it fits.

But we must confirm the feedback: if secret word is ""ANNUL"", then for guess 3 ""final"": F(x), I(x), N(✓ at position 3), A(- at position 4? But in ""ANNUL"", position 4 is U, not A? And A is at position 1? So if we guessed A at position 4 and it was not there? But A is present at position 1? So feedback should not show A(-) if A at another position? Wait: feedback for ""final"": A was guessed at position 4? So it would be (-) because A is in the word but not at position 4 (since it's at position 1). And L at position 5: ✓. So it matches.

So ""ANNUL"" is a candidate.

But are there others?

What about ""ANVIL""? But I is absent? Position 2: V? But we have position 4? ""ANVIL"": A, N, V, I, L → but I is absent? So position 4: I which is absent? That would be x? But in our pattern, position 4 must be a letter not absent? I is absent, so ""ANVIL"" cannot be because I is not in the word? Absent.

Similarly, ""ANFEL"" F absent.

Another possibility: ""AUGHT"" but no N and would have position 3 G.

No.

""ANTIC"" T absent? T is absent? From guess 2: T(x) so absent.

So perhaps ""ANNUL"" is acceptable.

But note: we do not know if there are duplicates? But if we guess ""ANNUL"", we can win.

But what if there are other possibilities? E.g., with different letters.

For example: ""AGONL"" not a word.

Or ""ADDNL"" no.

""AHAND"" not.

Another word: ""ALMOND"" too long.

5-letter: ""AMPLE"" E and S? Not.

Perhaps ""UNBAR"" not starting with A.

I think ""ANNUL"" is the most likely.

But we can also consider ""ADUNC"" not a word.

Or ""AWARN"" no.

So, given that we have 4 tries left, we can try ""ANNUL"".

But we are in guess 4.

But note: we might get it right.

If not, we will get feedback.

But since we have two positions to guess, we might try to test one letter only? But we have to provide a full word.

Another option: make a guess that tests one of the missing positions with a common letter.

For example, try a word like ""ANNUL"" only.

But if we are not sure, we could try a different word that doesn't assume duplicates.

But in the pattern ""A _ N _ L"", the only common word seems to be ""ANNUL"".

Alternative: ""ANKLE"" but E absent.

""AMPLE"" same.

""ADULT"" → A,D,U,L,T → but T absent and L at position 4? But we need L at position 5? And N at position 3? Not.

So I think we should guess ""ANNUL"".

To confirm: the secret word must have A at position 1, N at position 3, L at position 5, and positions 2 and 4 filled with non-absent letters. ""ANNUL"" uses N and U, and N is already present, so duplicate is fine, and U has not been tried.

So let's go with ""ANNUL"".

Guess: ""ANNUL""
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses:

### Key Insights:
1. **Absent Letters**: C, R, E, S, T, Y, F, I (confirmed not in the word).
2. **Correct Positions**:
   - N is fixed at position 3 (from ""final"" feedback: N(✓)).
   - L is fixed at position 5 (from ""final"" feedback: L(✓)).
3. **Letter A**:
   - Present in the word but in the wrong position (A(-) in all three guesses at positions 3, 2, and 4).
   - Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (due to feedback).
   - Only possible remaining positions are 1 or 5.
   - Position 5 is occupied by L (fixed), so A must be in position 1.
4. **Secret Word Pattern**:  
   Position 1: A (deduced)  
   Position 2: Unknown (must be a letter not absent)  
   Position 3: N (fixed)  
   Position 4: Unknown (must be a letter not absent)  
   Position 5: L (fixed)  
   Pattern: `A _ N _ L`
5. **Available Letters**: B, D, G, H, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (from the alphabet excluding absent letters).

### Deductions:
- The word must start with A, have N in position 3, end with L, and use available letters for positions 2 and 4.
- After considering common English words fitting `A _ N _ L`, the word ""ANNUL"" is a valid match:
  - Positions: A (1), N (2), N (3), U (4), L (5).
  - Uses available letters: U is not among the absent letters.
  - Addresses the duplicate N possibility (not ruled out by feedback).
- Testing ""ANNUL"" will either solve the word or provide critical feedback:  
  - If position 2 is not N, the feedback can eliminate possibilities.  
  - If position 4 is not U, the feedback can confirm other options.

### Next Guess:
Given the above, ""ANNUL"" is a strong candidate as it uses the deduced pattern and available letters. If incorrect, the feedback will directly reveal the unknown positions.

<guess>annul</guess>",annul,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
Guess 2: ""nasty"" -> Feedback: N(-), A(-), S(x), T(x), Y(x)
Guess 3: ""final"" -> Feedback: F(x), I(x), N(✓), A(-), L(✓)

Let's analyze:

From all feedback:

Absent letters (marked x): C, R, E, S, T, Y, F, I. So these letters are not in the secret word at all.

Present letters:
- A: has been marked (-) in all three guesses, meaning it is in the word but never in the correct position. We have tried A in positions: 3 (crane), 2 (nasty), and 4 (final). Therefore, A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Since it must be in the word and not in those positions, the only possible positions left are 1 or 5.

- N: in guess 3, N is marked ✓ in position 3. Therefore, N is in the secret word and is fixed at position 3. This is confirmed by the feedback.

Additionally, from guess 3:
- L is marked ✓ in position 5. Therefore, L is in the secret word and fixed at position 5.

Now, N is at position 3 and L is at position 5.

Summary of knowns:
- Position 3: N (correct)
- Position 5: L (correct)
- A is present but not in positions 2,3,4 → must be in position 1. (Since position 3 is taken by N, and position 5 is taken by L, so A cannot be at 5? Wait, let's see: positions are 1 to 5. Position 3 and 5 are fixed. A must be in 1 or 5, but position 5 is L, so A must be at position 1.)

Therefore:
- Position 1 must be A. (Because we have only positions 1 and 5 possible for A, but position 5 is occupied by L, so A has to be at position 1.)

But wait, is that confirmed? Let's see: A must be in the word and we have tried positions 2,3,4 with (-), so only positions 1 or 5 are possible. Now, position 5 is L (as per the checkmark in guess 3), so L is fixed at position 5. Therefore, A must be at position 1.

So we have:
- Position 1: A
- Position 3: N
- Position 5: L

The secret word is of the form: A _ N _ L

Now, we need to guess the letters at position 2 and position 4.

We know the missing letters must be:
- Not any of the absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, Y, F, I (from all feedback so far).
- They must be letters not yet tried or from the present list.

But we also have two positions to fill, and we know no other present letters yet? Wait, only A, N, L are fixed, but there are two more letters.

Let's list all absent letters: from the feedback, absent are: C, E, R, S, T, Y, F, I.

So the remaining possible letters: B, D, G, H, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We have two positions: 2 and 4.

We also have to make sure the word is valid.

Moreover, in guess 3 (""final""), we had A at position 4 but it showed (-), meaning that in the secret word, A is present but not at position 4. We already deduced it must be at position 1.

Now, we need a 5-letter word starting with A, then some letter, then N, then some letter, ending with L.

So pattern: A * N * L

And the * positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

We can think of possible words: ANGEL? But E is absent, so invalid.
ANVIL? V is allowed, but we have L at the end, but ANVIL has V at position 4 and I at position 2? ANVIL: A, N, V, I, L. But I is absent (from feedback, I is x in guess 3), so I cannot be used. So ""ANVIL"" is invalid.

Possible words:

- ""ANIML"" not a word.

- ""ANNUL"": A, N, N, U, L → has two N's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, positions: A(1), N(3)? Wait, no: position 3 is N, but in ""ANNUL"", position 2 is N, position 3 is N? Actually, ""ANNUL"": positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:N, 4:U, 5:L. But we have position 3 fixed as N, so that's okay. But position 2 would also be N? But in the secret word, we have position 3: N and position 5: L, so ""ANNUL"" would have N at position 2 and 3? But we have N as fixed at position 3 only. The word might have duplicate N's.

But from feedback, we don't have any information about duplicates. However, in guess 3 (""final""), we had N at position 3 correct, and we didn't get any extra feedback about other N's? But that's normal.

But let's see: if the word had two N's, it wouldn't contradict.

Similarly, other letters.

Common words fitting A _ N _ L:

- ""ANKLE"": but E is absent.

- ""ANGEL"": E absent.

- ""ANVIL"": I absent.

- ""ANNUL"" as above.

- ""ANXIOUS"" too long.

5-letter: ""ANILS""? Not a word.

""ANALE"" not a word.

""ABAND"" not a word.

""ADMIN"" but we have M and I? I is absent.

""ADONL"" not a word.

Let's try with the available letters.

Possible: ""ANGRL"" no.

Another: ""AWNING"" too long.

Perhaps ""JUMPS"" doesn't fit.

Wait, common ones: ""ANMOL"" no.

I think of ""ANVIL"" but I is out.

What about ""ANNAL""? It means a record of events. ""ANNAL"": A, N, N, A, L? Positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L. Now, we have A at position 1 and 4? But we have constraint that A must be at position 1? And at position 4? But we also have position 4 is A? But in the pattern, we are putting A at position 1 and position 4? But in ""ANNAL"", it has two A's.

But our word must have A at position 1? And we have position 4 as the second letter? But in our case, we have position 3 as N, position 5 as L. So:

- Position 1: A → must be A? Yes, as deduced.
- Position 2: ? 
- Position 3: N → fixed.
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: L → fixed.

So ""ANNAL"" fits: A, N, N, A, L → but positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L. So it has A at position 4? But we have a problem: we deduced A must be at position 1, but if A is also at position 4, that's fine. However, in the feedback from guess 3 (""final""), we guessed A at position 4 and it showed (-), not (✓). That means in the secret word, A is not at position 4. So ""ANNAL"" would have A at position 4, but we got (-) for A at position 4, which implies that position 4 is not A. Therefore, ""ANNAL"" is invalid.

Similarly, any word with A at position 4 is invalid because we tried A at position 4 and it was wrong position (-), meaning it is not at 4.

But in our pattern, position 4 must be a different letter.

Back to possible: ""AUNTL"" not a word.

""ARUNL"" no.

""ALLOW"" doesn't have N at third.

List possible letters for position 2 and 4: from the available set: B, D, G, H, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words: ""AVIAN"" not matching pattern.

Word: A * N * L

Examples:
- ""ANNUL"" → A(1), N(2), N(3), U(4), L(5). This fits: positions match with N at 3 and L at 5? Wait: position 3 is N, which is fixed. But in ""ANNUL"", position 3 is the third letter which is the second N? Yes: ANNUL → 1:A, 2:N, 3:N, 4:U, 5:L. So position 3 is N (which is fixed) → okay. Position 5 is L → okay. And A at position 1 → okay.

We need to check if the letters are possible:
- Position 2: N → but we have no constraint on position 2 except that it cannot be absent letters. Is N allowed? N is already in the word, but duplicates are possible. And we haven't tried N at position 2? In previous guesses:
  - Guess 1: N was at position 4 → - (wrong position)
  - Guess 2: N was at position 1 → - (wrong position)
  - Guess 3: N at position 3 → ✓

So we haven't tried N at position 2. So it could be possible.

But note: if N is at position 2, then we have two N's: one at 2 and one at 3.

Is there any feedback against duplicates? No.

Similarly, U at position 4: U is available.

But we have absent letters? U not absent.

Also, L at 5 is fixed.

Does this word avoid absent letters? A, N, N, U, L → absent: C,R,E,S,T,Y,F,I not included → good.

Another word: ""ANOLE"" → but E is absent.

""ANGLO"" → G and O, but ends with O? Not L.

""ANKHS"" → S absent.

""AMNIO"" → not ending with L.

""ANNEX"" → E absent and X not? E absent.

Perhaps ""ANNUL"" is a candidate.

But are there others?

""BANAL"" but first letter A? Pattern is fixed first letter A.

""ANDAL"" not a word.

""MANOR"" not.

""ANYOL"" no.

Another: ""ANSWER"" too long.

Perhaps ""ANJUL"" not a word.

Maybe ""ADDLE"" doesn't have N at third.

Word ""UNDID"" not.

I think ""ANNUL"" is a possible word.

Another possibility: ""APPLE"" → P and P, but E absent and no N? Must have N at third.

No.

""ASSET"" S absent.

So perhaps ""ANNUL"" is the only common word? Or ""CANDY"" C absent.

Let's think: ""AWNED"" E absent.

""OUNCE"" E absent.

We need to fill position 2 and 4.

Possible combinations: e.g., A with D and G: ""ADNGL"" not a word.

With U: as in ""ANNUL"".

Another word: ""ANIMAL"" too long.

5-letter: ""ANHEL"" not a word.

""ARVAL"" but R absent.

So, ""ANNUL"" seems a valid option.

But we could also try ""MANUL"" but M at first? Pattern must start with A. ""MANUL"" starts with M.

No: our word must start with A.

So possible ""ANNUL"" or perhaps ""AZONL"" no.

""ANOMALY"" too long.

Moreover, we have to make a guess.

But we are not sure if duplicates are allowed.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" but doesn't end with L and no N at third? Must have N at position 3.

Position 3 must be N.

So ""A _ N _ L""

"" AUDIO"" → A,U,D,I,O → positions: 1:A, 2:U, 3:D? not N.

No.

""ALIGN"" → A,L,I,G,N → positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:I? not N. And L at position 2, but our L is at position 5? Could be, but we have fixed L at position 5? No: in the word, position 5 must be L.

In ""ALIGN"", if we have N at position 5? But we need position 3 to be N.

So no.

Therefore, the only common word I can think of is ""ANNUL"": A, N, N, U, L.

We know U is available? Yes.

But in ""ANNUL"", position 2 is N, which we haven't tested.

And position 4 is U.

So it fits.

But we must confirm the feedback: if secret word is ""ANNUL"", then for guess 3 ""final"": F(x), I(x), N(✓ at position 3), A(- at position 4? But in ""ANNUL"", position 4 is U, not A? And A is at position 1? So if we guessed A at position 4 and it was not there? But A is present at position 1? So feedback should not show A(-) if A at another position? Wait: feedback for ""final"": A was guessed at position 4? So it would be (-) because A is in the word but not at position 4 (since it's at position 1). And L at position 5: ✓. So it matches.

So ""ANNUL"" is a candidate.

But are there others?

What about ""ANVIL""? But I is absent? Position 2: V? But we have position 4? ""ANVIL"": A, N, V, I, L → but I is absent? So position 4: I which is absent? That would be x? But in our pattern, position 4 must be a letter not absent? I is absent, so ""ANVIL"" cannot be because I is not in the word? Absent.

Similarly, ""ANFEL"" F absent.

Another possibility: ""AUGHT"" but no N and would have position 3 G.

No.

""ANTIC"" T absent? T is absent? From guess 2: T(x) so absent.

So perhaps ""ANNUL"" is acceptable.

But note: we do not know if there are duplicates? But if we guess ""ANNUL"", we can win.

But what if there are other possibilities? E.g., with different letters.

For example: ""AGONL"" not a word.

Or ""ADDNL"" no.

""AHAND"" not.

Another word: ""ALMOND"" too long.

5-letter: ""AMPLE"" E and S? Not.

Perhaps ""UNBAR"" not starting with A.

I think ""ANNUL"" is the most likely.

But we can also consider ""ADUNC"" not a word.

Or ""AWARN"" no.

So, given that we have 4 tries left, we can try ""ANNUL"".

But we are in guess 4.

But note: we might get it right.

If not, we will get feedback.

But since we have two positions to guess, we might try to test one letter only? But we have to provide a full word.

Another option: make a guess that tests one of the missing positions with a common letter.

For example, try a word like ""ANNUL"" only.

But if we are not sure, we could try a different word that doesn't assume duplicates.

But in the pattern ""A _ N _ L"", the only common word seems to be ""ANNUL"".

Alternative: ""ANKLE"" but E absent.

""AMPLE"" same.

""ADULT"" → A,D,U,L,T → but T absent and L at position 4? But we need L at position 5? And N at position 3? Not.

So I think we should guess ""ANNUL"".

To confirm: the secret word must have A at position 1, N at position 3, L at position 5, and positions 2 and 4 filled with non-absent letters. ""ANNUL"" uses N and U, and N is already present, so duplicate is fine, and U has not been tried.

So let's go with ""ANNUL"".

Guess: ""ANNUL""After analyzing the feedback from all previous guesses:

### Key Insights:
1. **Absent Letters**: C, R, E, S, T, Y, F, I (confirmed not in the word).
2. **Correct Positions**:
   - N is fixed at position 3 (from ""final"" feedback: N(✓)).
   - L is fixed at position 5 (from ""final"" feedback: L(✓)).
3. **Letter A**:
   - Present in the word but in the wrong position (A(-) in all three guesses at positions 3, 2, and 4).
   - Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (due to feedback).
   - Only possible remaining positions are 1 or 5.
   - Position 5 is occupied by L (fixed), so A must be in position 1.
4. **Secret Word Pattern**:  
   Position 1: A (deduced)  
   Position 2: Unknown (must be a letter not absent)  
   Position 3: N (fixed)  
   Position 4: Unknown (must be a letter not absent)  
   Position 5: L (fixed)  
   Pattern: `A _ N _ L`
5. **Available Letters**: B, D, G, H, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (from the alphabet excluding absent letters).

### Deductions:
- The word must start with A, have N in position 3, end with L, and use available letters for positions 2 and 4.
- After considering common English words fitting `A _ N _ L`, the word ""ANNUL"" is a valid match:
  - Positions: A (1), N (2), N (3), U (4), L (5).
  - Uses available letters: U is not among the absent letters.
  - Addresses the duplicate N possibility (not ruled out by feedback).
- Testing ""ANNUL"" will either solve the word or provide critical feedback:  
  - If position 2 is not N, the feedback can eliminate possibilities.  
  - If position 4 is not U, the feedback can confirm other options.

### Next Guess:
Given the above, ""ANNUL"" is a strong candidate as it uses the deduced pattern and available letters. If incorrect, the feedback will directly reveal the unknown positions.",Guess 4: annul -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(✓) N(✓) U(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
