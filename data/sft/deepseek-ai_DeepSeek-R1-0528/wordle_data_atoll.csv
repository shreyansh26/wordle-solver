We are making the first guess. Since the initial guess doesn't have any feedback to work with, we need a strategic starting word.
 A common strategy is to choose a word that has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Let's choose ""CRANE"". This word includes common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It covers vowels A and E and common consonants C, R, N.
</think>
<thinking>
For the first guess, I don't have any prior feedback to work with, so I need to choose a word that maximizes information. A good starting word should:
- Contain common English letters
- Include at least two vowels to test vowel positions
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more ground

""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It contains five distinct letters
2. It has vowels A and E (two of the most common vowels)
3. It uses common consonants C, R, N
4. It covers multiple possible letter positions efficiently

This word frequently appears in Wordle strategies because it often reveals valuable information about:
- Whether any of these common letters exist in the secret word
- Placement of vowels and consonants early on

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (where it was in CRANE).
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

We need to make a second guess that:
1. Does not include the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).
2. Must include the letter A, but not in the second position.
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word.

We'll choose a word that includes A in a different position and uses other common letters to maximize information.

Available letters: We can use any letters except C, R, N, E.

Common consonants to consider: S, T, L, P, H, M, D, G, etc.

Let's think about words that have A in positions other than 2 (that is, positions 1, 3, 4, or 5) and avoid C, R, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- A in position 1: Words like ""APPLE"", but we must avoid A in second position? Actually, A can be in any position except second for this word? But note: the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put A in position 1, that's allowed because it's not position 2. Similarly, positions 3, 4, 5.

We must choose a word without C, R, N, E.

Common starting words that include A: 
- SALAD (but L and D are available? and S is available) -> S, A, L, A, D -> but A repeated? Actually, we can have repeated letters? The rules don't say we can't, but the feedback might help too.

However, note the feedback: A is in the word. It could be multiple times? We don't know.

Since we have limited information, let's try to include other common vowels or consonants.

Another idea: Since A is known, we can try placing it in the first position? Maybe.

Consideration: We want to cover more common letters. Letters we haven't tested: T, L, S, O, M, H, etc.

Possible words: 
- ""PLANT"" -> but N is not allowed (we got N as x) and T is new. Wait, N is not in the word? From feedback: N(x) so we can't use N.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So, let's try to form words with A and other common letters.

For example:
- Position 1: A -> like ""ADIEU"" but E is not allowed and we don't want E. 
- ""AUDIO"": contains A, U, D, I, O -> avoids C,R,N,E. And A is in position 1 (not 2). 
But let's see if it uses only available letters: U, D, I, O are not used yet and not forbidden? Correct.

But maybe we can test more common consonants? ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P -> avoids C,R,N,E. But A is in third position? Then we want to avoid second position? We can use any position except second? We can put A in position 3 (as in STAMP) because that's different from second.

Actually, the feedback does not forbid A in any specific position except that it cannot be in the second position? But we know it's in the word somewhere else.

So both ""AUDIO"" and ""STAMP"" are valid.

But which one gives more information?

""AUDIO"" has the advantage of testing multiple vowels: A, U, I, O. But it only tests one consonant (D) and vowels. Since we already have one vowel (A), testing more vowels might be good? Or perhaps we should test more consonants.

Alternatively, ""STAMP"": tests S, T, A, M, P. These are common consonants and A. And it tests A in position 3.

Since the secret word has A, and we don't know its position, using ""STAMP"" would help:
- If A is in the secret word and in position 3? Then we get a check mark? But if not, then we get a '-' again? Or if not, then we know A is not in position 3.

Similarly, we'll learn about S,T,M,P.

Another option: ""BLIMP""? But L and I? We have to avoid E? But B, L, I, M, P? Avoids C,R,N,E.

But maybe ""STAMP"" is more common? Or ""SLATE"" -> but E is forbidden and we can't use E.

Wait, we cannot use E because feedback says E is not in the word.

So, words without C,R,N,E.

List words with A in position 1, or 3, or 4, or 5.

Position 1: 
- ""ABOUT""
- ""ADULT""
- ""AGENT"" -> but E not allowed? So ""ADULT""? D,U,L,T -> all new? And A in position 1.

But ""ADULT"" has U which is a vowel? We also need to test consonants.

Position 3: 
- ""STAMP""
- ""TRACK"" -> contains C? C is forbidden -> avoid C.
- ""PLAZA"" -> Z is less common? 
- ""BLACK"" -> C is forbidden.

Position 4:
- ""OPERA"" -> but E and R? R is forbidden? We cannot use R. So no.
- ""DELTA"" -> E and T? E is forbidden.

So, perhaps ""STAMP"" is a good choice because it has common consonants and A is in position 3.

Another word: ""SOLAR"" -> but R and S? R is forbidden? We cannot use R.

Yes, avoid R.

So, let me decide on:

Option 1: ""AUDIO"" (A in position 1) -> tests vowels: A, U, I, O and consonant D.
Option 2: ""STAMP"" (A in position 3) -> tests consonants S, T, M, P and A.

Which is better? Since the secret word is English, consonants are equally important. We want to cover more common letters.

But note: We already know A is in the word, so testing U, I, O in ""AUDIO"" might tell us that the word has more vowels? Or not?

Alternatively, testing four consonants and A?

Also, ""STAMP"" avoids using too many vowels? Because we already know A is present and we have excluded E? And we don't know about others.

But let's see frequency: consonants like S, T, P, M are very frequent.

So, I think ""STAMP"" is a good guess because it tests four new consonants and A in a different position.

We could also try ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> it has two A's? And A in position 2? But we know A is not to be placed in position 2? Actually, the word ""PASTA"" has A in position 2? 
P (1), A (2) -> oh, no. We must avoid A in position 2? So ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5? But we are forbidden from putting A in position 2? Because the feedback for CRANE said A is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, we should not guess a word with A in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but if we do, then if the feedback shows a '-' for A in position 2, that would be the same as before? So it's redundant.

So better to avoid putting A in position 2 in our next guess to test other positions.

Therefore, avoid position 2 for A.

In ""PASTA"", A is in position 2 and 5? So it would be bad because position 2 is forbidden? We don't want to waste a position? Therefore, we should avoid words where A is in the second position.

So ""STAMP"": positions: S (1), T (2), A (3), M (4), P (5). So A is in position 3, which is safe? Not position 2.

Similarly, ""ADULT"": A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5) -> A in position 1.

So both are valid.

I think I'll choose ""STAMP"" to test more consonants.

Therefore, the second guess: STAMP

But let's confirm: Letters in STAMP: S, T, A, M, P. None of these are forbidden? We avoided C, R, N, E.

So, it's safe.

If we get feedback on A, it will tell us whether A is in position 3? Or elsewhere? But we'll get feedback per letter.

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":

- **Feedback**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
- Meaning: 
  - A is in the secret word but not in the second position (avoid guessing A in position 2).
  - Letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (avoid using these letters).
- Strategy for the second guess:
  - Include A in a position other than 2 (e.g., 1, 3, 4, or 5).
  - Test new common letters not used in ""CRANE"" to maximize information.
  - Avoid the excluded letters: C, R, N, E.
  - Prioritize words with high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, M, P) and distinct letters.

A strong candidate is **""STAMP""** because:
- It places A in position 3 (not position 2).
- Tests new common letters: S, T, M, P.
- Avoids forbidden letters C, R, N, E.
- Provides potential feedback on A's position and other consonants.
- Example feedback interpretation:
  - If A gets ✓, it's in position 3.
  - If A gets -, it's present but in another position.
  - Feedback on S, T, M, P reveals if they appear.

For the first guess, I don't have any prior feedback to work with, so I need to choose a word that maximizes information. A good starting word should:
- Contain common English letters
- Include at least two vowels to test vowel positions
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more ground

""CRANE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It contains five distinct letters
2. It has vowels A and E (two of the most common vowels)
3. It uses common consonants C, R, N
4. It covers multiple possible letter positions efficiently

This word frequently appears in Wordle strategies because it often reveals valuable information about:
- Whether any of these common letters exist in the secret word
- Placement of vowels and consonants early on
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (where it was in CRANE).
- The letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

We need to make a second guess that:
1. Does not include the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).
2. Must include the letter A, but not in the second position.
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word.

We'll choose a word that includes A in a different position and uses other common letters to maximize information.

Available letters: We can use any letters except C, R, N, E.

Common consonants to consider: S, T, L, P, H, M, D, G, etc.

Let's think about words that have A in positions other than 2 (that is, positions 1, 3, 4, or 5) and avoid C, R, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- A in position 1: Words like ""APPLE"", but we must avoid A in second position? Actually, A can be in any position except second for this word? But note: the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put A in position 1, that's allowed because it's not position 2. Similarly, positions 3, 4, 5.

We must choose a word without C, R, N, E.

Common starting words that include A: 
- SALAD (but L and D are available? and S is available) -> S, A, L, A, D -> but A repeated? Actually, we can have repeated letters? The rules don't say we can't, but the feedback might help too.

However, note the feedback: A is in the word. It could be multiple times? We don't know.

Since we have limited information, let's try to include other common vowels or consonants.

Another idea: Since A is known, we can try placing it in the first position? Maybe.

Consideration: We want to cover more common letters. Letters we haven't tested: T, L, S, O, M, H, etc.

Possible words: 
- ""PLANT"" -> but N is not allowed (we got N as x) and T is new. Wait, N is not in the word? From feedback: N(x) so we can't use N.

We must avoid C, R, N, E.

So, let's try to form words with A and other common letters.

For example:
- Position 1: A -> like ""ADIEU"" but E is not allowed and we don't want E. 
- ""AUDIO"": contains A, U, D, I, O -> avoids C,R,N,E. And A is in position 1 (not 2). 
But let's see if it uses only available letters: U, D, I, O are not used yet and not forbidden? Correct.

But maybe we can test more common consonants? ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P -> avoids C,R,N,E. But A is in third position? Then we want to avoid second position? We can use any position except second? We can put A in position 3 (as in STAMP) because that's different from second.

Actually, the feedback does not forbid A in any specific position except that it cannot be in the second position? But we know it's in the word somewhere else.

So both ""AUDIO"" and ""STAMP"" are valid.

But which one gives more information?

""AUDIO"" has the advantage of testing multiple vowels: A, U, I, O. But it only tests one consonant (D) and vowels. Since we already have one vowel (A), testing more vowels might be good? Or perhaps we should test more consonants.

Alternatively, ""STAMP"": tests S, T, A, M, P. These are common consonants and A. And it tests A in position 3.

Since the secret word has A, and we don't know its position, using ""STAMP"" would help:
- If A is in the secret word and in position 3? Then we get a check mark? But if not, then we get a '-' again? Or if not, then we know A is not in position 3.

Similarly, we'll learn about S,T,M,P.

Another option: ""BLIMP""? But L and I? We have to avoid E? But B, L, I, M, P? Avoids C,R,N,E.

But maybe ""STAMP"" is more common? Or ""SLATE"" -> but E is forbidden and we can't use E.

Wait, we cannot use E because feedback says E is not in the word.

So, words without C,R,N,E.

List words with A in position 1, or 3, or 4, or 5.

Position 1: 
- ""ABOUT""
- ""ADULT""
- ""AGENT"" -> but E not allowed? So ""ADULT""? D,U,L,T -> all new? And A in position 1.

But ""ADULT"" has U which is a vowel? We also need to test consonants.

Position 3: 
- ""STAMP""
- ""TRACK"" -> contains C? C is forbidden -> avoid C.
- ""PLAZA"" -> Z is less common? 
- ""BLACK"" -> C is forbidden.

Position 4:
- ""OPERA"" -> but E and R? R is forbidden? We cannot use R. So no.
- ""DELTA"" -> E and T? E is forbidden.

So, perhaps ""STAMP"" is a good choice because it has common consonants and A is in position 3.

Another word: ""SOLAR"" -> but R and S? R is forbidden? We cannot use R.

Yes, avoid R.

So, let me decide on:

Option 1: ""AUDIO"" (A in position 1) -> tests vowels: A, U, I, O and consonant D.
Option 2: ""STAMP"" (A in position 3) -> tests consonants S, T, M, P and A.

Which is better? Since the secret word is English, consonants are equally important. We want to cover more common letters.

But note: We already know A is in the word, so testing U, I, O in ""AUDIO"" might tell us that the word has more vowels? Or not?

Alternatively, testing four consonants and A?

Also, ""STAMP"" avoids using too many vowels? Because we already know A is present and we have excluded E? And we don't know about others.

But let's see frequency: consonants like S, T, P, M are very frequent.

So, I think ""STAMP"" is a good guess because it tests four new consonants and A in a different position.

We could also try ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> it has two A's? And A in position 2? But we know A is not to be placed in position 2? Actually, the word ""PASTA"" has A in position 2? 
P (1), A (2) -> oh, no. We must avoid A in position 2? So ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5? But we are forbidden from putting A in position 2? Because the feedback for CRANE said A is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, we should not guess a word with A in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but if we do, then if the feedback shows a '-' for A in position 2, that would be the same as before? So it's redundant.

So better to avoid putting A in position 2 in our next guess to test other positions.

Therefore, avoid position 2 for A.

In ""PASTA"", A is in position 2 and 5? So it would be bad because position 2 is forbidden? We don't want to waste a position? Therefore, we should avoid words where A is in the second position.

So ""STAMP"": positions: S (1), T (2), A (3), M (4), P (5). So A is in position 3, which is safe? Not position 2.

Similarly, ""ADULT"": A(1), D(2), U(3), L(4), T(5) -> A in position 1.

So both are valid.

I think I'll choose ""STAMP"" to test more consonants.

Therefore, the second guess: STAMP

But let's confirm: Letters in STAMP: S, T, A, M, P. None of these are forbidden? We avoided C, R, N, E.

So, it's safe.

If we get feedback on A, it will tell us whether A is in position 3? Or elsewhere? But we'll get feedback per letter.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":

- **Feedback**: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
- Meaning: 
  - A is in the secret word but not in the second position (avoid guessing A in position 2).
  - Letters C, R, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (avoid using these letters).
- Strategy for the second guess:
  - Include A in a position other than 2 (e.g., 1, 3, 4, or 5).
  - Test new common letters not used in ""CRANE"" to maximize information.
  - Avoid the excluded letters: C, R, N, E.
  - Prioritize words with high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, M, P) and distinct letters.

A strong candidate is **""STAMP""** because:
- It places A in position 3 (not position 2).
- Tests new common letters: S, T, M, P.
- Avoids forbidden letters C, R, N, E.
- Provides potential feedback on A's position and other consonants.
- Example feedback interpretation:
  - If A gets ✓, it's in position 3.
  - If A gets -, it's present but in another position.
  - Feedback on S, T, M, P reveals if they appear.

We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: CRANE**
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, but not in position 2)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Thus, forbidden letters: **C, R, N, E**  
We know **A** is in the word, but not in position 2.

**Guess 2: STAMP**
- S: x (not in word)
- T: ✓ (in word and in correct position, position 2)  
- A: - (in word, but not in position 3)  
- M: x (not in word)
- P: x (not in word)

Thus, additional forbidden letters: **S, M, P**  
**T** is confirmed to be in the secret word at position 2.  
**A** is still in the word, but now we know it's not in position 2 or 3.

**Summary:**
- Position 2 is **T** (from STAMP feedback).
- **A** is in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3.
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, S, M, P  
- Remaining possible positions for A: 1, 4, or 5.
- We need to guess a new 5-letter word that:
  - Has T in position 2.
  - Includes A in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2 or 3).
  - Avoids forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, S, M, P.
  - Tests new letters to gain information.

**Strategy for Guess 3:**
We must include T (fixed at pos 2) and A (somewhere in 1/4/5).  
We should prioritize common letters not yet tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y, etc.  
Ideal words: Start with A at pos 1? Or put A at pos 4/5? Test new consonants.

**Possible Words:**
- Option: **TABLE** → T at pos 2? But TABLE: T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). But E is forbidden, and pos 2 must be T? Not matching.  
- Better: Since pos 2 is T, structure: \_ T \_ \_ \_  
- Words with A: try A at beginning (pos 1), or end (pos 4 or 5).

**Examples:**
1. A at 1: **A T _ _ _**  
   - **ATONE** → but forbidden: O? Not forbidden but N and E yes → N/E not allowed.  
   - **ATLAS** → S forbidden.  
   - **ATTIC** → T repeated? And C forbidden.  
   - Possible words:  
     - **ATOLL** → A, T, O, L, L → but L repeated? Avoid repetition?  
     - **ABOUT** → B, O, U, T → T at end? But we need T at pos 2 → structure: A T \_ \_ \_ → ABOUT has T at end? No.  
     - **ALTOS** → S forbidden? Yes.  
   - Good: **AUDIO** → but E forbidden? Audio: A U D I O → avoids forbidden letters? But U, D, I, O are new? No forbidden: C,R,N,E,S,M,P all avoided? Valid. But A at pos 1? And we need T at pos 2 → AUDIO doesn’t have T at all? But we know T must be at pos 2 → conflict? AUDIO: no T? But T is fixed at pos 2? So we cannot skip T? Must include it.

2. A not at 1? Then at 4 or 5:  
   - Structure: \_ T \_ A \_ ?  
   - Words: **L T A ...**? Need common words.  
   - **OPT A?** O,P,T: P forbidden?  
   - **B T _ A _**: **BATHA**? Not word.  
   - **G T _ A _**: **GOTH A** → GOTHA not a word.  
   - More common: **D T _ A _**: **DUTYA** not word.

Instead, try A at 5:  
- \_ T \_ \_ A  
  - Words: **UTILEA** not word. **ITAL A** → no.

Since A can be at 1, think of words with A at 1 and T at 2? A T  \_ \_ \_  
Possible words:
- **ATCH** — not English.  
- **AT O _ _**:  
  - **ATONE** → N/E forbidden? No: E is in ATONE → forbidden!  
  - **AT OOP** → not word.  
  - Good: **ATOLL** → A T O L → then L twice? But valid word? Avoid repetition?  
  - **ATILT** → I, L, T? T repeated? And avoid? No, repetition is allowed? But T is already at pos 2 and then again? Secret might have multiple T? But feedback only said T at pos 2, doesn't rule out other T.  
  - **ATTIC** → forbidden letters: C forbidden.  
  - **ATTAR** → R forbidden? Yes.

Letters available: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y  

Try: **ATHOD** → no word. **ATHUD** → no.  

Good option: **ADOPT** → A D O P T → A at 1, D O P T → P forbidden? Yes? P is forbidden? Guess 2: STAMP → P(x), so P is forbidden. So ADOPT contains P? Invalid?  

Another: **ABOUT** → A at 1? ABOUT: A B O U T → T at pos 5? Needs T at pos 2? Not!

Wait: We must have T at position 2. So: A T ? ? ?

Possible words starting with AT and not containing forbidden letters?  
- Letters: without C, R, N, E, S, M, P  
- Try: **A T T I C** → C forbidden and T repeated? Valid?  
- **A T O L L** → ATOLL → one T? A T O L L → third L? but two L? Letter set: A, T, O, L.  
  - **ATOLL**: A(1) T(2) O(3) L(4) L(5)? Or positions: 1:A, 2:T, 3:O, 4:L, 5:L. It has L twice? But that's fine? Also, forbidden letters? Avoided: C,R,N,E,S,M,P? No P? Good.  

But what about other options?  

Another: **A T O U ?** → ATOUR not word. **ATOUK** not word.  

**A T O K → ATOKA** not word.  

Alternative: Use other common letters?  

If not A at 1, then A must be at 4 or 5?  

For example: \_ T \_ \_ A  
Possible: **ITALA**? Or **OPT A?**  
Common words: **TOD A Y** → 6 letters?  

Better: **B T L A ?** **BITAL** not word.  

**H T A L A** → HTALA not word.  

Perhaps A at 4: \_ T \_ A \_  
Words:  
- **UTIAM** → no.  
- **G T I A B** → no.  
- **L TIA N** → no and N forbidden.  

So: A at position 1 is the easiest? With A T O L L (ATOLL)  
But repetition? Might give less information? Since L appears twice? Then we test fewer unique letters?  

Alternatively: **A T H O D** not word.  

New word: **A T Y P E** → E forbidden? Yes.  

**A T D O G** → ATDOG → not word.  

Valid word: **ATOLL**  
However, let's think: we want to test new letters?  

Another: **A T O L L** → positions: A(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), L(5) → we know T is fixed at 2, we don't test pos 3? We don't know about O and L?  

Possible: Use word with more new letters?  

**A T O W ?** → **TOWED** → no, TOWED has T at 1?  
**A T O G L** → not word.  

**ALTO** → only 4 letters?  

5-letter words: **AT OLL** seems valid?  

Another: **A U T O ?** AUTOS → S forbidden?  
**A U T O M** → M forbidden? M already forbidden? STAMP → M(x).  

So: **ATOLL** seems a valid word?  

But ATOLL has two L? Are we okay with that? Yes.

**But feedback for A: we know A is not at pos 2 or 3, so if we put A at pos 1 and O at pos 3? If O is in the word? We'll get feedback?**

But let's choose ATOLL? Or is there a better word?

Another idea: **A T B O ?** → AT BO... **ATBOA** no? **ATOBY**? Not word?  

Forget A at 1? Put A at position 5? Then structure: \_ T \_ \_ A  

Words:  
- **ITALA** no  
- **UT I L A** — UTILA → U T I L A → positions: U(1), T(2), I(3), L(4), A(5) → UTILA is not English? But **UTILE** has E? Forbidden?  

**UTILA** not standard.  

**O T A L A** → OTALA? No. **OTALY**? No.  

**B T L A A** → no.  

Common word: **C T E A?** No, forbidden letters.  

**L T A V A** → no.  

Perhaps: **HOT A L** → H O T A L → T at 3? Must be T at 2? Structure: \_ T \_ \_ A → so third letter? Not T?  

Valid word example: **M I T Z A** — not common? Might not be in word list?  

Better: **ALT A** → too short or ALTAR has R forbidden?  

Conclusion: A at position 1 is the most viable? Words starting with A T?  

Alternative: **A T H L E** → E forbidden?  
**A T H O K** not word.  

Back to **ATOLL**: let's accept it? But is ATOLL acceptable? Yes, it's a valid English word.  

But ATOLL uses O and L? Both new?  

Perhaps **ATTIC** but C forbidden?  

Another word: **A T O K I N** too long.  

I found: **A T O N E** → forbidden E and N? Both forbidden? By guess 1? N and E forbidden.  

**A D O B E** → E forbidden?  

So letters without C,R,N,E,S,M,P: B,D,G,H,I,K,L,O,U,W,Y  

For A T \_ \_ \_:  
- **ATOLL** uses A,T,O,L,L → letters: A,T,O,L → L twice?  
- **AT A K ?** ATAKU no? AT K → **ATT K** no.  
- **A T B E D** forbidden E?  
- **A T G U Y** → ATGUY not word?  
- **A T D I P** → P forbidden? P forbidden? Yes? STAMP: P(x).  

Another real word: **A T O M Y** → M forbidden? STAMP: M(x)? So M forbidden? Yes.  

So **ATOLL** seems okay?  

But to maximize information? Since L appears twice? If we guess L, and one is correct? Or wrong? It might not tell us much?  

Alternative: Use word with A not at 1? But as above, it's hard.  

Structure: \_ T \_ \_ A → what about **M U T H A**? Not standard.  

Or **K U T A I** → not common.  

**D U T Y A** → no.  

Perhaps **H O T L Y** → T not at 2?  

Have to accept that A at position 1 is necessary?  

Another common word: **A T T A** → not 5 letters?  

So: ATOLL is valid.  
But let’s try another position for A?  

Consider A at 4: \_ T \_ A \_  

Words: **I T I A S** no? With letters allowed: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, Y, W → **H T I A B**? No.  

**G T I A D** not word.  

**U T A H A**? UTAHA not? UTAH is 4?  

Not easy? Then **ATOLL** might be a good choice? Or maybe use a word that has different vowel?  

But we know A is present so we must include it?  

Perhaps don't put A at 1?  

Try A at 5: \_ T \_ \_ A → words: **G A T H A** → G at1 T at 3? Not? Structure: position 1: ? ; 2:T ; 3:? ; 4:? ; 5:A → for example: **B T O K A**? Not?  

**L T A K A** no? Or **O T E L A** → E forbidden?  

**I T A S U** no?  

**Valid word**: **KANT A** → K A T at 1? No: K A N T A → N forbidden?  

Perhaps **AL T A R** -> R forbidden?  
**AL T I A** -> AL T I A → A at 1 AND 5? And T at 3? Not matching position for T?  

Forget? Maybe accept **ATOLL**.  

But wait: another word with A at 1 and T at 2: **ATH L O W**? No?  

Or **A T L A S** -> forbidden S?  

I think **ATOLL** is reasonable.

However, we want test more unique letters? So avoid repetition? Let’s choose a word without repetition? Since L is tested only once? **ATOLL** has two L, so we are testing L once? But if feedback shows L not in word? Then both L are wrong? So same as single L? But if one L is correct? We get feedback for each position? So it's okay? But less efficient? We test fewer unique letters? For example, compared to a word like **A T O P I** → P forbidden?  

So find a word with distinct letters? With structure A T ? ? ?  

Possible: **A T O U R** → R forbidden?  
**A T O K Y** not word?  
**A T O M I** → M forbidden?  

**A T O N I** → N forbidden?  

**A T U L I** → U, L, I? A T U L I: A T U L I? Not a word? **ATULI** not standard.  

**ADULT**: has A at 1 and D U L T → T at pos 5? But we need T at pos 2? So not? **ADULT**: positions: A(1) D(2) U(3) L(4) T(5) → pos 2 is D, but must be T? Conflict.  

We **must have T at pos 2**.  

Another distinct letters? **A T I O L** → ATIOL? Not word.  
**A T I D E** → E forbidden?  

**A T B O G** → ATBOG not word?  

So, let’s choose **ATOLL**.  

But to test more vowels? Like U or I?  

We can choose **AT U L D**? No.  

Or **A T I L K** → valid? **ATILK**? Not English word?  

Valid word: **ABO L T** → T at end? No?  

I think **ATOLL** is the best? Or **AUDIT**? **AUDIT**: A U D I T → but T at pos 5? Must be T at pos 2? Not.  

So, **ATOLL** is a word? Yes: atoll (a ring-shaped reef)  

Thus, guess: **ATOLL**  

But wait: feedback for guess 2 showed A is in the word but not at pos 3? So if we place O at 3? And if O is in the word? Feedback will tell?  

Alternatively: Do not include O?  

But we have no information.  

Another distinct word: **A T H O D** no.  

Perhaps **A G T O ?**? Not.  

We go with **ATOLL**.

**But** now forbidden letters: C,R,N,E,S,M,P  
**ATOLL**: letters: A, T, O, L, L → avoid all forbidden? Yes? T is fixed at 2? Positions:  
1: A  
2: T  
3: O  
4: L  
5: L  

We know:
- A is not at 2 or 3? But in this guess, A at 1: which is allowed?  
- O at 3: unknown?  
- L at 4 and 5: test L?  

If we don't care about repetition? Okay.  

So let's guess ATOLL?  

Actually, let's think: In Wordle, repetition might be important? But here we are allowed.

Decision: **ATOLL**  

But feedback might be unclear? If L is incorrect? Then both L are x?  

Another word: **A T R I A** → R forbidden? Yes.

Or **B T A B Y** no.  

Perhaps **U T A Q Q** no?  

I think it's acceptable.  

Therefore, next guess: **ATOLL**

As a better choice? Consider putting A at 4?

For example, build a word? But what words have T at 2 and A at 4?  
Structure: \_ T \_ A \_  

Letters to use: B,D,G,H,I,K,L,O,U,W,Y  

Example: **D T O A B** → DTOAB no?  

**H T I A L** → H T I A L → HTIAL not English?  

**W T O A M** → M forbidden?  

Valid word: **ITALY**? Letters: I, T, A, L, Y → wait: positions: I(1) T(2) A(3) L(4) Y(5) → A at position 3? But feedback from STAMP said A is not at position 3? Yes? Guess 2: STAMP had A at pos 3? And feedback A(-)? Meaning A is in the word but not at pos 3? So we cannot put A at pos 3? In ITALY, A at pos 3? We are forbidden? So invalid as a guess? Because we know A is not at pos 3?  

Yes! Important: We must avoid placing A at positions 2 or 3.  

For ITALY: A is at pos 3? We know that the secret word's A is not at 3? So if we guess A at 3, it will be x or? Actually, no? The secret has A? But not at 3? So guessing A at 3 would give feedback x? Because not in correct position? Feedback rules: 
- If letter in secret at that position? Then ✓  
- Else if letter in secret but elsewhere? Then -  
- Else x?  

Here, since A is in the secret? But not at pos 3, then if we guess A at pos 3, we should get - (wrong position)? Not x? But we don't know where it is?  

Actually: 
- Only if the letter is exactly in position? ✓  
- Else, if the letter appears elsewhere? - (meaning in word but wrong pos)  
- Else? x  

Since A is known to be in the secret? So wherever we put A, except if in correct position, will get -? Even if we put A at pos 3? Why? It's not correct pos, but since A is in secret? Then -? Right?  

But that doesn't make progress because we already know that from guess 1?  

So to reduce? It’s better to test A in a new position? For example, put at 4? Then if we get -, we know it's not in pos 4?  

In STAMP, we tested A at pos 3? Got -, meaning A is not at 3?  

If we test A at pos 4? And get -, then not at 4? Or if ✓, then correct?  

Similarly, at pos 5?  

Or at pos 1? Then if we test A at 1? And if the secret is at 1? Then ✓?  

So for ATOLL: 
- Position 1: A, so we test if A is at 1?  
  - If ✓, then solved?  
  - If -, then A not at 1?  

Either way? Learn something?  

Similarly, if we put at position 5? etc.

In ATOLL, we are testing A at position 1?  

And T fixed? So let’s do that?  

Also, test O and L?  

Perhaps better word with more unique letters?  

With structure \_ T \_ A \_? Position: 1:? 2:T 3:? 4:A 5:?

And A at 4? Avoid pos 3?  

Letters: ? T ? A ? 

Forbidden: C,R,N,E,S,M,P  
Available: B,D,G,H,I,K,L,O,U,W,Y  

Examples? **B T H A D** ? Not?  
**B T I A D** → BT IAD?  
**G T I A L** → GTIAL → not word?  

**K T O A B**? No.  

Valid word: **D U T C H** → C forbidden?  

**H U T A K** → no?  

**W O T A N** → N forbidden? Guess 1: N(x)  

A word: **L I T A I**? Not?  

I found: **KAT I A**? K A T I A → positions: K at 1? A at 2? But position 2 must be T? No? Required T at 2?  

Structure for . T . A .:  
- **OTHAK** no?  
- **B T U A ?** **BATU S** S forbidden?  

**G U T T A** → G U T T A: G(1) U(2)? T(3) T(4) A(5) → but position 2 must be T? Not U?  

So not.

Another: **D T A B S** no.

Perhaps **HOT L A** not 5 letters?  

It’s difficult? So stick with ATOLL?  

Or choose another word: **A T H A R** → R forbidden?  

Decision: Guess **ATOLL**

Therefore, Guess 3: ATOLL
</think>
**Thought Process for Guess 3:**

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE):** 
     - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → Letters C, R, N, E are **not** in the secret word. A is present but **not** in position 2.
   - **Guess 2 (STAMP):**
     - S(x), T(✓), A(-), M(x), P(x) → Letters S, M, P are **not** in the secret word. T is in position 2 (confirmed ✓). A is present but **not** in position 3 (since feedback shows - for A at pos 3).
   - **Summary of Known Information:**
     - Position 2 is **T** (fixed from Guess 2 feedback).
     - **A** is in the word but **not** in positions 2 or 3 (must be in 1, 4, or 5).
     - Forbidden letters (not in the word): C, R, N, E, S, M, P.
     - Letters to prioritize for testing: Remaining common letters, such as B, D, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y.

2. **Strategy for Guess 3:**
   - Must include **T** in position 2 and incorporate **A** in a new position (positions 1, 4, or 5) to test its location efficiently.
   - Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, S, M, P).
   - Focus on distinct letters to maximize information gain (if possible) but prioritize valid words.
   - Consider testing a new vowel and consonants: In particular, A's position should be tested thoroughly—position 1 was a prime candidate as it hadn't been evaluated yet, and feedback would directly reveal if A is in position 1 or not.
   - Brainstorm possible words:
     - Structure: Letter 2 must be T.
     - A in position 1: e.g., ""ATOLL"" (A T O L L), ""ATILK"" (invalid), ""ATHOD"" (invalid). ""ATOLL"" was identified as a valid option, testing O and L—L appears twice, which is acceptable but less efficient for testing unique letters.
     - A in position 4: e.g., ""BTIAD"" (invalid), ""GUTTA"" (T repeated and position mismatch). Few valid words exist without using forbidden letters.
     - A in position 5: e.g., ""UTILA"" (invalid), ""OTELA"" (E forbidden).
     - After evaluation, **""ATOLL""** emerged as the strongest choice:
       - Positives: A at position 1 (tests potentially correct position), O and L tested, avoids forbidden letters.
       - Negatives: L repeated (but still provides positional feedback), no new vowel test.
   - Alternate options like ""ATILK"" were considered but rejected due to invalidity. ""ATOLL"" balances validity and information potential for this stage.
   - Expected feedback interpretation:
     - If A gets ✓, position 1 is correct.
     - If A gets -, A not in position 1.
     - Feedback for O (position 3) and L (positions 4 and 5) reveals their presence/absence.

3. **Choice:** ""ATOLL"" was selected as the best candidate, leveraging available clues while testing A's position aggressively.

<guess>ATOLL</guess>",ATOLL,"We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: CRANE**
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, but not in position 2)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Thus, forbidden letters: **C, R, N, E**  
We know **A** is in the word, but not in position 2.

**Guess 2: STAMP**
- S: x (not in word)
- T: ✓ (in word and in correct position, position 2)  
- A: - (in word, but not in position 3)  
- M: x (not in word)
- P: x (not in word)

Thus, additional forbidden letters: **S, M, P**  
**T** is confirmed to be in the secret word at position 2.  
**A** is still in the word, but now we know it's not in position 2 or 3.

**Summary:**
- Position 2 is **T** (from STAMP feedback).
- **A** is in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3.
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, S, M, P  
- Remaining possible positions for A: 1, 4, or 5.
- We need to guess a new 5-letter word that:
  - Has T in position 2.
  - Includes A in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2 or 3).
  - Avoids forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, S, M, P.
  - Tests new letters to gain information.

**Strategy for Guess 3:**
We must include T (fixed at pos 2) and A (somewhere in 1/4/5).  
We should prioritize common letters not yet tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y, etc.  
Ideal words: Start with A at pos 1? Or put A at pos 4/5? Test new consonants.

**Possible Words:**
- Option: **TABLE** → T at pos 2? But TABLE: T(1), A(2), B(3), L(4), E(5). But E is forbidden, and pos 2 must be T? Not matching.  
- Better: Since pos 2 is T, structure: \_ T \_ \_ \_  
- Words with A: try A at beginning (pos 1), or end (pos 4 or 5).

**Examples:**
1. A at 1: **A T _ _ _**  
   - **ATONE** → but forbidden: O? Not forbidden but N and E yes → N/E not allowed.  
   - **ATLAS** → S forbidden.  
   - **ATTIC** → T repeated? And C forbidden.  
   - Possible words:  
     - **ATOLL** → A, T, O, L, L → but L repeated? Avoid repetition?  
     - **ABOUT** → B, O, U, T → T at end? But we need T at pos 2 → structure: A T \_ \_ \_ → ABOUT has T at end? No.  
     - **ALTOS** → S forbidden? Yes.  
   - Good: **AUDIO** → but E forbidden? Audio: A U D I O → avoids forbidden letters? But U, D, I, O are new? No forbidden: C,R,N,E,S,M,P all avoided? Valid. But A at pos 1? And we need T at pos 2 → AUDIO doesn’t have T at all? But we know T must be at pos 2 → conflict? AUDIO: no T? But T is fixed at pos 2? So we cannot skip T? Must include it.

2. A not at 1? Then at 4 or 5:  
   - Structure: \_ T \_ A \_ ?  
   - Words: **L T A ...**? Need common words.  
   - **OPT A?** O,P,T: P forbidden?  
   - **B T _ A _**: **BATHA**? Not word.  
   - **G T _ A _**: **GOTH A** → GOTHA not a word.  
   - More common: **D T _ A _**: **DUTYA** not word.

Instead, try A at 5:  
- \_ T \_ \_ A  
  - Words: **UTILEA** not word. **ITAL A** → no.

Since A can be at 1, think of words with A at 1 and T at 2? A T  \_ \_ \_  
Possible words:
- **ATCH** — not English.  
- **AT O _ _**:  
  - **ATONE** → N/E forbidden? No: E is in ATONE → forbidden!  
  - **AT OOP** → not word.  
  - Good: **ATOLL** → A T O L → then L twice? But valid word? Avoid repetition?  
  - **ATILT** → I, L, T? T repeated? And avoid? No, repetition is allowed? But T is already at pos 2 and then again? Secret might have multiple T? But feedback only said T at pos 2, doesn't rule out other T.  
  - **ATTIC** → forbidden letters: C forbidden.  
  - **ATTAR** → R forbidden? Yes.

Letters available: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y  

Try: **ATHOD** → no word. **ATHUD** → no.  

Good option: **ADOPT** → A D O P T → A at 1, D O P T → P forbidden? Yes? P is forbidden? Guess 2: STAMP → P(x), so P is forbidden. So ADOPT contains P? Invalid?  

Another: **ABOUT** → A at 1? ABOUT: A B O U T → T at pos 5? Needs T at pos 2? Not!

Wait: We must have T at position 2. So: A T ? ? ?

Possible words starting with AT and not containing forbidden letters?  
- Letters: without C, R, N, E, S, M, P  
- Try: **A T T I C** → C forbidden and T repeated? Valid?  
- **A T O L L** → ATOLL → one T? A T O L L → third L? but two L? Letter set: A, T, O, L.  
  - **ATOLL**: A(1) T(2) O(3) L(4) L(5)? Or positions: 1:A, 2:T, 3:O, 4:L, 5:L. It has L twice? But that's fine? Also, forbidden letters? Avoided: C,R,N,E,S,M,P? No P? Good.  

But what about other options?  

Another: **A T O U ?** → ATOUR not word. **ATOUK** not word.  

**A T O K → ATOKA** not word.  

Alternative: Use other common letters?  

If not A at 1, then A must be at 4 or 5?  

For example: \_ T \_ \_ A  
Possible: **ITALA**? Or **OPT A?**  
Common words: **TOD A Y** → 6 letters?  

Better: **B T L A ?** **BITAL** not word.  

**H T A L A** → HTALA not word.  

Perhaps A at 4: \_ T \_ A \_  
Words:  
- **UTIAM** → no.  
- **G T I A B** → no.  
- **L TIA N** → no and N forbidden.  

So: A at position 1 is the easiest? With A T O L L (ATOLL)  
But repetition? Might give less information? Since L appears twice? Then we test fewer unique letters?  

Alternatively: **A T H O D** not word.  

New word: **A T Y P E** → E forbidden? Yes.  

**A T D O G** → ATDOG → not word.  

Valid word: **ATOLL**  
However, let's think: we want to test new letters?  

Another: **A T O L L** → positions: A(1), T(2), O(3), L(4), L(5) → we know T is fixed at 2, we don't test pos 3? We don't know about O and L?  

Possible: Use word with more new letters?  

**A T O W ?** → **TOWED** → no, TOWED has T at 1?  
**A T O G L** → not word.  

**ALTO** → only 4 letters?  

5-letter words: **AT OLL** seems valid?  

Another: **A U T O ?** AUTOS → S forbidden?  
**A U T O M** → M forbidden? M already forbidden? STAMP → M(x).  

So: **ATOLL** seems a valid word?  

But ATOLL has two L? Are we okay with that? Yes.

**But feedback for A: we know A is not at pos 2 or 3, so if we put A at pos 1 and O at pos 3? If O is in the word? We'll get feedback?**

But let's choose ATOLL? Or is there a better word?

Another idea: **A T B O ?** → AT BO... **ATBOA** no? **ATOBY**? Not word?  

Forget A at 1? Put A at position 5? Then structure: \_ T \_ \_ A  

Words:  
- **ITALA** no  
- **UT I L A** — UTILA → U T I L A → positions: U(1), T(2), I(3), L(4), A(5) → UTILA is not English? But **UTILE** has E? Forbidden?  

**UTILA** not standard.  

**O T A L A** → OTALA? No. **OTALY**? No.  

**B T L A A** → no.  

Common word: **C T E A?** No, forbidden letters.  

**L T A V A** → no.  

Perhaps: **HOT A L** → H O T A L → T at 3? Must be T at 2? Structure: \_ T \_ \_ A → so third letter? Not T?  

Valid word example: **M I T Z A** — not common? Might not be in word list?  

Better: **ALT A** → too short or ALTAR has R forbidden?  

Conclusion: A at position 1 is the most viable? Words starting with A T?  

Alternative: **A T H L E** → E forbidden?  
**A T H O K** not word.  

Back to **ATOLL**: let's accept it? But is ATOLL acceptable? Yes, it's a valid English word.  

But ATOLL uses O and L? Both new?  

Perhaps **ATTIC** but C forbidden?  

Another word: **A T O K I N** too long.  

I found: **A T O N E** → forbidden E and N? Both forbidden? By guess 1? N and E forbidden.  

**A D O B E** → E forbidden?  

So letters without C,R,N,E,S,M,P: B,D,G,H,I,K,L,O,U,W,Y  

For A T \_ \_ \_:  
- **ATOLL** uses A,T,O,L,L → letters: A,T,O,L → L twice?  
- **AT A K ?** ATAKU no? AT K → **ATT K** no.  
- **A T B E D** forbidden E?  
- **A T G U Y** → ATGUY not word?  
- **A T D I P** → P forbidden? P forbidden? Yes? STAMP: P(x).  

Another real word: **A T O M Y** → M forbidden? STAMP: M(x)? So M forbidden? Yes.  

So **ATOLL** seems okay?  

But to maximize information? Since L appears twice? If we guess L, and one is correct? Or wrong? It might not tell us much?  

Alternative: Use word with A not at 1? But as above, it's hard.  

Structure: \_ T \_ \_ A → what about **M U T H A**? Not standard.  

Or **K U T A I** → not common.  

**D U T Y A** → no.  

Perhaps **H O T L Y** → T not at 2?  

Have to accept that A at position 1 is necessary?  

Another common word: **A T T A** → not 5 letters?  

So: ATOLL is valid.  
But let’s try another position for A?  

Consider A at 4: \_ T \_ A \_  

Words: **I T I A S** no? With letters allowed: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, Y, W → **H T I A B**? No.  

**G T I A D** not word.  

**U T A H A**? UTAHA not? UTAH is 4?  

Not easy? Then **ATOLL** might be a good choice? Or maybe use a word that has different vowel?  

But we know A is present so we must include it?  

Perhaps don't put A at 1?  

Try A at 5: \_ T \_ \_ A → words: **G A T H A** → G at1 T at 3? Not? Structure: position 1: ? ; 2:T ; 3:? ; 4:? ; 5:A → for example: **B T O K A**? Not?  

**L T A K A** no? Or **O T E L A** → E forbidden?  

**I T A S U** no?  

**Valid word**: **KANT A** → K A T at 1? No: K A N T A → N forbidden?  

Perhaps **AL T A R** -> R forbidden?  
**AL T I A** -> AL T I A → A at 1 AND 5? And T at 3? Not matching position for T?  

Forget? Maybe accept **ATOLL**.  

But wait: another word with A at 1 and T at 2: **ATH L O W**? No?  

Or **A T L A S** -> forbidden S?  

I think **ATOLL** is reasonable.

However, we want test more unique letters? So avoid repetition? Let’s choose a word without repetition? Since L is tested only once? **ATOLL** has two L, so we are testing L once? But if feedback shows L not in word? Then both L are wrong? So same as single L? But if one L is correct? We get feedback for each position? So it's okay? But less efficient? We test fewer unique letters? For example, compared to a word like **A T O P I** → P forbidden?  

So find a word with distinct letters? With structure A T ? ? ?  

Possible: **A T O U R** → R forbidden?  
**A T O K Y** not word?  
**A T O M I** → M forbidden?  

**A T O N I** → N forbidden?  

**A T U L I** → U, L, I? A T U L I: A T U L I? Not a word? **ATULI** not standard.  

**ADULT**: has A at 1 and D U L T → T at pos 5? But we need T at pos 2? So not? **ADULT**: positions: A(1) D(2) U(3) L(4) T(5) → pos 2 is D, but must be T? Conflict.  

We **must have T at pos 2**.  

Another distinct letters? **A T I O L** → ATIOL? Not word.  
**A T I D E** → E forbidden?  

**A T B O G** → ATBOG not word?  

So, let’s choose **ATOLL**.  

But to test more vowels? Like U or I?  

We can choose **AT U L D**? No.  

Or **A T I L K** → valid? **ATILK**? Not English word?  

Valid word: **ABO L T** → T at end? No?  

I think **ATOLL** is the best? Or **AUDIT**? **AUDIT**: A U D I T → but T at pos 5? Must be T at pos 2? Not.  

So, **ATOLL** is a word? Yes: atoll (a ring-shaped reef)  

Thus, guess: **ATOLL**  

But wait: feedback for guess 2 showed A is in the word but not at pos 3? So if we place O at 3? And if O is in the word? Feedback will tell?  

Alternatively: Do not include O?  

But we have no information.  

Another distinct word: **A T H O D** no.  

Perhaps **A G T O ?**? Not.  

We go with **ATOLL**.

**But** now forbidden letters: C,R,N,E,S,M,P  
**ATOLL**: letters: A, T, O, L, L → avoid all forbidden? Yes? T is fixed at 2? Positions:  
1: A  
2: T  
3: O  
4: L  
5: L  

We know:
- A is not at 2 or 3? But in this guess, A at 1: which is allowed?  
- O at 3: unknown?  
- L at 4 and 5: test L?  

If we don't care about repetition? Okay.  

So let's guess ATOLL?  

Actually, let's think: In Wordle, repetition might be important? But here we are allowed.

Decision: **ATOLL**  

But feedback might be unclear? If L is incorrect? Then both L are x?  

Another word: **A T R I A** → R forbidden? Yes.

Or **B T A B Y** no.  

Perhaps **U T A Q Q** no?  

I think it's acceptable.  

Therefore, next guess: **ATOLL**

As a better choice? Consider putting A at 4?

For example, build a word? But what words have T at 2 and A at 4?  
Structure: \_ T \_ A \_  

Letters to use: B,D,G,H,I,K,L,O,U,W,Y  

Example: **D T O A B** → DTOAB no?  

**H T I A L** → H T I A L → HTIAL not English?  

**W T O A M** → M forbidden?  

Valid word: **ITALY**? Letters: I, T, A, L, Y → wait: positions: I(1) T(2) A(3) L(4) Y(5) → A at position 3? But feedback from STAMP said A is not at position 3? Yes? Guess 2: STAMP had A at pos 3? And feedback A(-)? Meaning A is in the word but not at pos 3? So we cannot put A at pos 3? In ITALY, A at pos 3? We are forbidden? So invalid as a guess? Because we know A is not at pos 3?  

Yes! Important: We must avoid placing A at positions 2 or 3.  

For ITALY: A is at pos 3? We know that the secret word's A is not at 3? So if we guess A at 3, it will be x or? Actually, no? The secret has A? But not at 3? So guessing A at 3 would give feedback x? Because not in correct position? Feedback rules: 
- If letter in secret at that position? Then ✓  
- Else if letter in secret but elsewhere? Then -  
- Else x?  

Here, since A is in the secret? But not at pos 3, then if we guess A at pos 3, we should get - (wrong position)? Not x? But we don't know where it is?  

Actually: 
- Only if the letter is exactly in position? ✓  
- Else, if the letter appears elsewhere? - (meaning in word but wrong pos)  
- Else? x  

Since A is known to be in the secret? So wherever we put A, except if in correct position, will get -? Even if we put A at pos 3? Why? It's not correct pos, but since A is in secret? Then -? Right?  

But that doesn't make progress because we already know that from guess 1?  

So to reduce? It’s better to test A in a new position? For example, put at 4? Then if we get -, we know it's not in pos 4?  

In STAMP, we tested A at pos 3? Got -, meaning A is not at 3?  

If we test A at pos 4? And get -, then not at 4? Or if ✓, then correct?  

Similarly, at pos 5?  

Or at pos 1? Then if we test A at 1? And if the secret is at 1? Then ✓?  

So for ATOLL: 
- Position 1: A, so we test if A is at 1?  
  - If ✓, then solved?  
  - If -, then A not at 1?  

Either way? Learn something?  

Similarly, if we put at position 5? etc.

In ATOLL, we are testing A at position 1?  

And T fixed? So let’s do that?  

Also, test O and L?  

Perhaps better word with more unique letters?  

With structure \_ T \_ A \_? Position: 1:? 2:T 3:? 4:A 5:?

And A at 4? Avoid pos 3?  

Letters: ? T ? A ? 

Forbidden: C,R,N,E,S,M,P  
Available: B,D,G,H,I,K,L,O,U,W,Y  

Examples? **B T H A D** ? Not?  
**B T I A D** → BT IAD?  
**G T I A L** → GTIAL → not word?  

**K T O A B**? No.  

Valid word: **D U T C H** → C forbidden?  

**H U T A K** → no?  

**W O T A N** → N forbidden? Guess 1: N(x)  

A word: **L I T A I**? Not?  

I found: **KAT I A**? K A T I A → positions: K at 1? A at 2? But position 2 must be T? No? Required T at 2?  

Structure for . T . A .:  
- **OTHAK** no?  
- **B T U A ?** **BATU S** S forbidden?  

**G U T T A** → G U T T A: G(1) U(2)? T(3) T(4) A(5) → but position 2 must be T? Not U?  

So not.

Another: **D T A B S** no.

Perhaps **HOT L A** not 5 letters?  

It’s difficult? So stick with ATOLL?  

Or choose another word: **A T H A R** → R forbidden?  

Decision: Guess **ATOLL**

Therefore, Guess 3: ATOLL**Thought Process for Guess 3:**

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE):** 
     - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x) → Letters C, R, N, E are **not** in the secret word. A is present but **not** in position 2.
   - **Guess 2 (STAMP):**
     - S(x), T(✓), A(-), M(x), P(x) → Letters S, M, P are **not** in the secret word. T is in position 2 (confirmed ✓). A is present but **not** in position 3 (since feedback shows - for A at pos 3).
   - **Summary of Known Information:**
     - Position 2 is **T** (fixed from Guess 2 feedback).
     - **A** is in the word but **not** in positions 2 or 3 (must be in 1, 4, or 5).
     - Forbidden letters (not in the word): C, R, N, E, S, M, P.
     - Letters to prioritize for testing: Remaining common letters, such as B, D, G, H, I, K, L, O, U, W, Y.

2. **Strategy for Guess 3:**
   - Must include **T** in position 2 and incorporate **A** in a new position (positions 1, 4, or 5) to test its location efficiently.
   - Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, S, M, P).
   - Focus on distinct letters to maximize information gain (if possible) but prioritize valid words.
   - Consider testing a new vowel and consonants: In particular, A's position should be tested thoroughly—position 1 was a prime candidate as it hadn't been evaluated yet, and feedback would directly reveal if A is in position 1 or not.
   - Brainstorm possible words:
     - Structure: Letter 2 must be T.
     - A in position 1: e.g., ""ATOLL"" (A T O L L), ""ATILK"" (invalid), ""ATHOD"" (invalid). ""ATOLL"" was identified as a valid option, testing O and L—L appears twice, which is acceptable but less efficient for testing unique letters.
     - A in position 4: e.g., ""BTIAD"" (invalid), ""GUTTA"" (T repeated and position mismatch). Few valid words exist without using forbidden letters.
     - A in position 5: e.g., ""UTILA"" (invalid), ""OTELA"" (E forbidden).
     - After evaluation, **""ATOLL""** emerged as the strongest choice:
       - Positives: A at position 1 (tests potentially correct position), O and L tested, avoids forbidden letters.
       - Negatives: L repeated (but still provides positional feedback), no new vowel test.
   - Alternate options like ""ATILK"" were considered but rejected due to invalidity. ""ATOLL"" balances validity and information potential for this stage.
   - Expected feedback interpretation:
     - If A gets ✓, position 1 is correct.
     - If A gets -, A not in position 1.
     - Feedback for O (position 3) and L (positions 4 and 5) reveals their presence/absence.

3. **Choice:** ""ATOLL"" was selected as the best candidate, leveraging available clues while testing A's position aggressively.",Guess 3: ATOLL -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) T(✓) O(✓) L(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
