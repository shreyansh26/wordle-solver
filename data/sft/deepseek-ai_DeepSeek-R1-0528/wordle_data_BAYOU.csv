We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 3 consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E) which are common.
   - It doesn't repeat any letters.
   - It covers letters that frequently appear in English words.

 So, our first guess will be ""CRANE"".

First, the feedback from my first guess ""CRANE"" is: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x). Let me interpret this:

- C(x): C is not in the word.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- A(-): A is in the word but not in the correct position.
- N(x): N is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So, only 'A' is present in the secret word, and it's in the wrong position. The other letters C, R, N, E are absent.

Now, I need to make a new 5-letter word guess that includes 'A' but not C, R, N, E. Also, since 'A' is not in position 3 (where it was in ""CRANE""), I should place 'A' in a different position.

Positions in ""CRANE"":
1. C (absent)
2. R (absent)
3. A (present but wrong position)
4. N (absent)
5. E (absent)

Therefore, 'A' cannot be in position 3 of the secret word. It must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Since many letters are eliminated, I should think of a word that uses common English letters and includes 'A', avoiding C, R, N, E.

Available letters: I can use any letters except C, R, N, E. But 'A' must be included.

Common vowels besides E are O, I, U, etc. Consonants like T, S, L, M, D, P, etc.

A good starting point might be words like ""SLATE"" or ""PLATE"", but E is absent, so I can't use E. Also, S, L, T are common.

Let's list possible words that include 'A' and avoid C, R, N, E.

For example:
- ""ALERT"": But R and E are absent, so avoid.
- ""APPLE"": Has P, L, E; E is absent, so not good.
- ""TASTY"": Has T, S, Y; but has S and T, and A. Sounds possible.

But ""TASTY"" repeats T, which might not be ideal for maximizing information, but it's fine.

Since 'A' is in position 3 of ""CRANE"" and it's wrong, I should try 'A' in position 1,2,4 or 5.

Let me try position 1: words like ""ADIEU"", but E is absent, so avoid.

E is absent, so no words ending with E commonly.

Position 2: e.g., ""PAINT"" has N, which is absent, so invalid. N is absent, so avoid N.

Similarly, ""SAVOR"": S, A, V, O, R – but R is absent, so no.

R is absent, so I cannot use R.

Similarly, C, N, E absent.

So letters to avoid: C, R, N, E.

I can use: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

'A' must be included, and not in position 3.

Possible words:

- ""BASIC"": But C is absent, so no. C invalid.

BASIC has C and S, C absent.

- ""LATIN"": Has N absent.

No N.

"" SALAD "": Has L, A, D; positions: S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, A at 4, D at 5? But ""SALAD"" is 5 letters? S-A-L-A-D, yes. But it has A in position 2 and 4. Since A is present, but we don't know if it repeats or not. But feedback only said A is present, didn't specify quantity, so it could be once or twice.

But for guess, minimizing unknown letters is good.

Better to use a word with unique letters for more information.

So, let's try a word like ""PLAIT"" or ""SPAIL"" but SPAIL not common.

"" PIOUS "" no A.

"" AUDIO "": A,U,D,I,O – this has A in position 1, U,D,I,O new letters.

""AUDIO"" could be good because it has vowels and includes A not in position 3.

Position 1 of ""AUDIO"" is A.

Now, A was position 3 in previous guess, wrong position, so if A is in position 1 here, and if it's correct, we get info.

Similarly, other positions.

""AUDIO"": letters A,U,D,I,O.

None of U,D,I,O are known absent yet, except C,R,N,E absent.

So, ""AUDIO"" could give good feedback.

Another option: ""SWAMP"": S,W,A,M,P – but M and P possible.

Both seem fine.

Since only one letter known present, I should aim for words with A in different position and common letters.

Position 3 is excluded for A, so try position 2 or 4.

For example, ""PLANT"" has N, absent.

No N or E.

"" TABLE "" has E, absent.

No E.

"" STALK "": S,T,A,L,K – sounds possible. A in position 3? Position:1-S,2-T,3-A,4-L,5-K.

But in previous, A was in position 3 and feedback said wrong position, so if I put A in position 3 again, it will likely be wrong again, but I need to avoid position 3 for A.

In ""STALK"", A is in position 3, same as before, so since we know it's wrong position, putting it there might not help. Better to put A in a different position.

So position 1: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ADULT"", ""AWARD"" etc.

""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T – includes O,U,T,B.

""ADULT"": A,D,U,L,T – includes D,U,L,T.

""ALIKE"": has E? ""ALIKE"" ends with E, absent.

No words ending with E.

"" AUDIO "" is A,U,D,I,O – all new letters except A.

Similarly, ""OUGHT"" no A.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a strong choice because it uses vowels and can confirm positions.

Another one: ""SAUCE"" but C absent, invalid.

So ""AUDIO"" seems good.

But let's check if ""AUDIO"" is a valid word; yes, it is.

Similarly, ""MEDIA"" has E, absent.

So yes.

Perhaps ""KARMA"" or something.

But ""KARMA"" has K,A,R,M,A – R is absent, so invalid. R absent.

Cannot use R.

So ""AUDIO"" avoids forbidden letters.

Therefore, I'll go with ""AUDIO"" as my second guess.

Feedback will tell: if A is in position 1 or not, and presence of U,D,I,O.

In format: I need to output <guess>audio</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").

Therefore, the new guess must:
- Include the letter ""A"" (since it's confirmed to be in the word).
- Avoid the letters C, R, N, and E.
- Place ""A"" in a position other than 3 (e.g., positions 1, 2, 4, or 5) to gather new information.
- Use common English letters to maximize the chance of hitting present letters.

A good choice is ""AUDIO"" because:
- It contains ""A"" placed in position 1, testing a new location.
- It introduces new common vowels (U, I, O) and a consonant (D), which could provide valuable feedback.
- It avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E).

This guess will help narrow down the position of ""A"" and identify if any of U, D, I, or O are in the word.

- A(-): A is in the word but not in the correct position.

Now, I need to make a new 5-letter word guess that includes 'A' but not C, R, N, E. Also, since 'A' is not in position 3 (where it was in ""CRANE""), I should place 'A' in a different position.

Positions in ""CRANE"":
1. C (absent)

E is absent, so no words ending with E commonly.

Position 2: e.g., ""PAINT"" has N, which is absent, so invalid. N is absent, so avoid N.

Similarly, ""SAVOR"": S, A, V, O, R – but R is absent, so no.

R is absent, so I cannot use R.

Similarly, C, N, E absent.

So letters to avoid: C, R, N, E.

I can use: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

'A' must be included, and not in position 3.

In ""STALK"", A is in position 3, same as before, so since we know it's wrong position, putting it there might not help. Better to put A in a different position.

So position 1: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ADULT"", ""AWARD"" etc.

""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T – includes O,U,T,B.

""ADULT"": A,D,U,L,T – includes D,U,L,T.

""ALIKE"": has E? ""ALIKE"" ends with E, absent.

No words ending with E.

"" AUDIO "" is A,U,D,I,O – all new letters except A.

Similarly, ""OUGHT"" no A.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a strong choice because it uses vowels and can confirm positions.

Another one: ""SAUCE"" but C absent, invalid.

So ""AUDIO"" seems good.

But let's check if ""AUDIO"" is a valid word; yes, it is.

Similarly, ""MEDIA"" has E, absent.

So yes.

Perhaps ""KARMA"" or something.

But ""KARMA"" has K,A,R,M,A – R is absent, so invalid. R absent.

Cannot use R.

So ""AUDIO"" avoids forbidden letters.

Therefore, I'll go with ""AUDIO"" as my second guess.

Feedback will tell: if A is in position 1 or not, and presence of U,D,I,O.

In format: I need to output <guess>audio</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").

Therefore, the new guess must:
- Include the letter ""A"" (since it's confirmed to be in the word).
- Avoid the letters C, R, N, and E.
- Place ""A"" in a position other than 3 (e.g., positions 1, 2, 4, or 5) to gather new information.
- Use common English letters to maximize the chance of hitting present letters.

A good choice is ""AUDIO"" because:
- It contains ""A"" placed in position 1, testing a new location.
- It introduces new common vowels (U, I, O) and a consonant (D), which could provide valuable feedback.
- It avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E).

This guess will help narrow down the position of ""A"" and identify if any of U, D, I, or O are in the word.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> A(-), U(-), D(x), I(x), O(-)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we placed it in position 1 and got ""-"").
- U is in the word but not in position 2 (where we placed it).
- D is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 5 (where we placed it).

So, from both guesses, we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, D, I.

Letters that ARE in the word: A, U, O (and we know they are present from the feedback).

Additionally, we know the positions that are incorrect for A, U, and O:
- A cannot be in position 1 or 3.
- U cannot be in position 2.
- O cannot be in position 5.

We also know that the word must contain at least three distinct letters: A, U, O. Since we have 5 letters, there are two more letters to find.

Now, let's list the known absent letters: C, R, N, E, D, I.

Available letters: all letters except C, R, N, E, D, I.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes A, U, O and two other letters from the available set.

Also, we must place A, U, O in positions that are not forbidden for them.

Forbidden positions:
- A: not 1 or 3 -> so A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- U: not 2 -> so U can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- O: not 5 -> so O can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: the word has 5 positions, and we have three letters that must be placed without conflicting.

We also need to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But so far, no feedback suggests that, so we assume no repeats for now to maximize information.

Now, let's think of common words that contain A, U, O and avoid the absent letters.

Available consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Available vowels: A, U, O (and we have Y which can be a vowel too).

We need two more letters. Let's try to pick common ones.

Possible words:

- ""ABOUT"": But we have B, O, U, T. However, we know A must be in the word, and ""ABOUT"" has A? No, ""ABOUT"" is A-B-O-U-T. But we have A, B, O, U, T. But in our feedback, we know A is in the word, but in ""ABOUT"", A is in position 1. However, from guess2, A cannot be in position 1 (because we had A in position1 and got ""-""). So ""ABOUT"" would have A in position1 which is invalid. Also, we have O and U, but we need to place them correctly.

Alternatively, ""AUDIO"" we already tried.

Another word: ""QUOTA"" but Q is available? Q is available, but let's see: Q-U-O-T-A. But we have U and O and A. Positions: Q(1), U(2), O(3), T(4), A(5). Now, check the constraints:

- A is in position 5: allowed (since A can be in 2,4,5)
- U is in position 2: but from guess2, U cannot be in position 2 (because we had U in position2 and got ""-""). So U cannot be in position2. Therefore, ""QUOTA"" has U in position2, which is invalid.

Similarly, ""SOUTH"": S-O-U-T-H. But O is in position2, U in position3, and no A. But we need A in the word. So invalid.

We must include A.

""FLOUR"": F-L-O-U-R, but R is absent (from guess1), so invalid.

""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T. Let's check:
- A is in position2: allowed (A can be 2,4,5)
- U is in position3: allowed (U can be 1,3,4,5)
- O is not in this word? But we know O is in the word from feedback. Guess2 had O and it was marked as present (O(-)), so O must be in the word. ""VAULT"" has no O, so invalid.

We need a word that has A, U, and O.

Possible words: ""ALOUD"", ""CLOUD"", but C and D are absent. C absent from guess1, D absent from guess2.

""GOUDA"": G-O-U-D-A, but D is absent, so invalid.

""JOUST"": J-O-U-S-T, no A.

""MOUTH"": M-O-U-T-H, no A.

""OUTTA"" not a word.

""POUCH"": P-O-U-C-H, C absent.

""QUAFF"": Q-U-A-F-F, has A and U, but no O? We need O. And F repeated? Also, O is missing.

We must have O.

""SOAPY"": S-O-A-P-Y, has O and A, but no U. We need U.

Similarly, ""BOAST"": B-O-A-S-T, has O and A, no U.

We need a word with A, U, O.

Let me think: ""AUDIO"" we already used, but that had D and I which are absent.

Another word: ""KAPUT""? K-A-P-U-T, has A and U, no O.

""MANOR"" has R and N, absent.

""MAUVE"" has E, absent.

""SAUNA"" has S,A,U,N,A. N is absent, and no O.

""SAUCE"" has C, absent.

""TAUPE"" has E, absent.

""UKASE"" has E, absent.

""ULYSS"" not a word.

""UMIAC"" not common.

""URAEI"" not common.

""USUAL"" has U,A,L, but no O? And S? ""USUAL"" is U-S-U-A-L, has U and A, but no O. And we have two U's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but feedback didn't indicate multiple, so we assume one of each for now.

But we need O.

Perhaps ""DOULA"" but D is absent.

""FOULE"" has E and no A? F-O-U-L-E.

Not working.

Another idea: ""OCTAD"" has C and D absent.

""OUZEL"" has E and Z, but no A.

""QUOTA"" we considered, but U in position2 is invalid.

What if we put U not in position2? For example, ""QUOTA"" cannot because U is fixed in position2.

But we can have words where U is in position1,3,4,5 (except 2).

Similarly, O in 1,2,3,4 (except 5).

A in 2,4,5.

Let me list possible words:

- ""OUIJA"" - O-U-I-J-A, but I is absent (from guess2), so invalid.

""JOUAL"" not common.

""LOUMA"" not common.

""MOULA"" not common.

""PULAO"" - P-U-L-A-O. This might be a word? Pulao is a rice dish. Let's consider: P-U-L-A-O.

Letters: P, U, L, A, O.

Check absent: P, L are available? C,R,N,E,D,I absent, so P and L are okay.

Now positions:
- P at 1
- U at 2: but U cannot be in position2 (from guess2 feedback: U(-) in position2). So U in position2 is invalid.

""PULAO"" has U in position2, not allowed.

""PODIA"" has D and I, absent.

""SOLAR"" has R and L, but R absent.

""VOLAR"" not common and R absent.

""YOGAS"" no U.

Perhaps ""AULOI"" but I is absent.

This is tricky.

Another word: ""FACET"" but C and E absent.

Not.

""GAMUT"" has M, A, U, T. But no O? We need O.

We must have O.

""GAUDY"" has G,A,U,D,Y. D is absent, so invalid.

""HAUTE"" has E.

""JUMAR"" has R.

""KAPUT"" no O.

""LAUAN"" has N, absent.

""MAUDS"" has D and S, but D absent.

""PAUSE"" has E.

""SAULT"" has S,A,U,L,T. But no O? And L and T. But O is missing.

""SAULT"" is a word, but it doesn't have O, but we know O is in the word.

From guess2, O is present, so it must be in the word.

Similarly, U and A.

So we need a word with A, U, O.

Let me search for common words with A, U, O.

Examples: 
- ""CAROL"" but C and R absent.
- ""FLOUR"" R absent.
- ""SOUTH"" no A.
- ""AUDIO"" already used.
- ""DOULA"" D absent.
- ""GOUDA"" D absent.
- ""JOUST"" no A.
- ""POUCH"" C absent.
- ""ROUSE"" R and E absent.
- ""ROUND"" R and D and N absent.
- ""SCOUR"" S,C,R absent.
- ""SHOUT"" no A.
- ""SQUAD"" D absent.
- ""TOUCH"" C absent.
- ""VOUCH"" C absent.
- ""WOULD"" W,O,U,L,D - D absent.
- ""COUPE"" C and E absent.
- ""FJORD"" F,J,O,R,D - R and D absent.
- ""GHOUL"" G,H,O,U,L - no A.
- ""YOUTH"" no A.

This is difficult. Maybe there are less common words.

Another idea: ""OUZEL"" has E and no A.

""UKASE"" has E.

""URAEI"" not common.

""USUAL"" no O.

""VODKA"" V,O,D,K,A - D absent.

""VOLTA"" V,O,L,T,A - has O and A, but no U. We need U.

""WACKO"" W,A,C,K,O - C absent.

""WAUGH"" W,A,U,G,H - has A and U, no O.

""YAUDS"" Y,A,U,D,S - D absent.

""YOGAS"" no U.

Perhaps ""OAKUM"" O,A,K,U,M - has O, A, U. And K and M.

Letters: O, A, K, U, M.

Check absent: K and M are available.

Positions: O at 1, A at 2, K at 3, U at 4, M at 5.

Now, check constraints:

- A is in position2: allowed (A can be 2,4,5)
- U is in position4: allowed (U can be 1,3,4,5) and not 2, so position4 is fine.
- O is in position1: allowed (O can be 1,2,3,4) and not 5, so position1 is fine.

Also, no forbidden letters.

So ""OAKUM"" is a valid word? Oakum is a material, so it should be acceptable.

We can use this.

Another word: ""KAPOK"" no U.

""MAUVE"" has E.

""OCTAN"" has C and N.

""OAKUM"" seems good.

""SUMAC"" has C, absent.

""TOLAR"" has R.

""UMIAC"" not common.

""UNCAP"" has N and C.

So I think ""OAKUM"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's confirm the spelling: O-A-K-U-M, yes.

Now, this will test:
- O in position1: if correct, we get ✓, else if present but wrong, -, etc.
- A in position2: if correct, ✓, else -.
- K in position3: new letter.
- U in position4: if correct, ✓, else -.
- M in position5: new letter.

And we know A, U, O are present, so we might get more position info.

If we get all correct, great, but likely not.

Another option: ""AULOS"" but S, and O? A-U-L-O-S. But L and S. And O in position4.

A in position1: but A cannot be in position1 (from guess2 feedback: A(-) in position1). So A in position1 is invalid. ""AULOS"" has A in position1, not allowed.

Similarly, ""OASIS"" no U.

So ""OAKUM"" seems a good choice.

Perhaps ""LOACH"" but C absent.

I think we should go with ""OAKUM"".

But let's see if there's a more common word.

""JUMBO"" has B, O, but no A or U? J-U-M-B-O, has U and O, no A. We need A.

""PUMAS"" has S, A, U, but no O. P-U-M-A-S.

No O.

""QUASI"" has Q, U, A, S, I. But I is absent, so invalid.

""SULFA"" has S,U,L,F,A, no O.

""TALUS"" has T,A,L,U,S, no O.

""UKASE"" has E.

So I think ""OAKUM"" is acceptable.

Therefore, our third guess is ""OAKUM"".

<guess>oakum</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, R, N, E are absent (x), and A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is present but not in position 1 (-), U is present but not in position 2 (-), D and I are absent (x), and O is present but not in position 5 (-).

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: A, U, O (all must appear, but not in the positions guessed).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, D, I (cannot be used).
- **Position constraints**:
  - A cannot be in position 1 or 3 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).
  - U cannot be in position 2 (must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5).
  - O cannot be in position 5 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- **Available letters**: All letters except C, R, N, E, D, I. Common choices include consonants like B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y and vowels like A, O, U.
- **Objective**: Choose a word that includes A, U, O (in allowed positions) and two new letters to maximize information.

### Thought Process:
- The word must contain A, U, and O, with A not in pos 1/3, U not in pos 2, and O not in pos 5.
- After evaluating options (e.g., ""QUOTA"" invalid due to U in pos 2, ""VAULT"" missing O, ""OUIJA"" has absent I), ""OAKUM"" (a valid word for tarred fiber) fits:
  - O in position 1 (allowed, as O cannot be in 5).
  - A in position 2 (allowed, as A cannot be in 1/3).
  - K in position 3 (new letter, tests for presence).
  - U in position 4 (allowed, as U cannot be in 2).
  - M in position 5 (new letter, tests for presence).
- ""OAKUM"" uses common letters, avoids conflicts, and tests key positions for A, U, O.

This guess will help confirm positions of known letters and reveal if K or M are in the word.

<guess>oakum</guess>",oakum,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)

- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> A(-), U(-), D(x), I(x), O(-)

- U is in the word but not in position 2 (where we placed it).
- D is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 5 (where we placed it).

So, from both guesses, we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, D, I.

Letters that ARE in the word: A, U, O (and we know they are present from the feedback).

Additionally, we know the positions that are incorrect for A, U, and O:

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes A, U, O and two other letters from the available set.

Also, we must place A, U, O in positions that are not forbidden for them.

Forbidden positions:
- A: not 1 or 3 -> so A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- U: not 2 -> so U can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- O: not 5 -> so O can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: the word has 5 positions, and we have three letters that must be placed without conflicting.

We also need to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But so far, no feedback suggests that, so we assume no repeats for now to maximize information.

Now, let's think of common words that contain A, U, O and avoid the absent letters.

Available consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Available vowels: A, U, O (and we have Y which can be a vowel too).

We need two more letters. Let's try to pick common ones.

Possible words:

- ""ABOUT"": But we have B, O, U, T. However, we know A must be in the word, and ""ABOUT"" has A? No, ""ABOUT"" is A-B-O-U-T. But we have A, B, O, U, T. But in our feedback, we know A is in the word, but in ""ABOUT"", A is in position 1. However, from guess2, A cannot be in position 1 (because we had A in position1 and got ""-""). So ""ABOUT"" would have A in position1 which is invalid. Also, we have O and U, but we need to place them correctly.

Alternatively, ""AUDIO"" we already tried.

Another word: ""QUOTA"" but Q is available? Q is available, but let's see: Q-U-O-T-A. But we have U and O and A. Positions: Q(1), U(2), O(3), T(4), A(5). Now, check the constraints:

- A is in position 5: allowed (since A can be in 2,4,5)
- U is in position 2: but from guess2, U cannot be in position 2 (because we had U in position2 and got ""-""). So U cannot be in position2. Therefore, ""QUOTA"" has U in position2, which is invalid.

Similarly, ""SOUTH"": S-O-U-T-H. But O is in position2, U in position3, and no A. But we need A in the word. So invalid.

We must include A.

""FLOUR"": F-L-O-U-R, but R is absent (from guess1), so invalid.

""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T. Let's check:
- A is in position2: allowed (A can be 2,4,5)
- U is in position3: allowed (U can be 1,3,4,5)
- O is not in this word? But we know O is in the word from feedback. Guess2 had O and it was marked as present (O(-)), so O must be in the word. ""VAULT"" has no O, so invalid.

We need a word that has A, U, and O.

Possible words: ""ALOUD"", ""CLOUD"", but C and D are absent. C absent from guess1, D absent from guess2.

""GOUDA"": G-O-U-D-A, but D is absent, so invalid.

""JOUST"": J-O-U-S-T, no A.

""MOUTH"": M-O-U-T-H, no A.

""OUTTA"" not a word.

""POUCH"": P-O-U-C-H, C absent.

""QUAFF"": Q-U-A-F-F, has A and U, but no O? We need O. And F repeated? Also, O is missing.

We must have O.

""SOAPY"": S-O-A-P-Y, has O and A, but no U. We need U.

Similarly, ""BOAST"": B-O-A-S-T, has O and A, no U.

We need a word with A, U, O.

Let me think: ""AUDIO"" we already used, but that had D and I which are absent.

Another word: ""KAPUT""? K-A-P-U-T, has A and U, no O.

""MANOR"" has R and N, absent.

""MAUVE"" has E, absent.

""SAUNA"" has S,A,U,N,A. N is absent, and no O.

""SAUCE"" has C, absent.

""TAUPE"" has E, absent.

""UKASE"" has E, absent.

""ULYSS"" not a word.

""UMIAC"" not common.

""URAEI"" not common.

""USUAL"" has U,A,L, but no O? And S? ""USUAL"" is U-S-U-A-L, has U and A, but no O. And we have two U's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but feedback didn't indicate multiple, so we assume one of each for now.

But we need O.

Perhaps ""DOULA"" but D is absent.

""FOULE"" has E and no A? F-O-U-L-E.

Not working.

Another idea: ""OCTAD"" has C and D absent.

""OUZEL"" has E and Z, but no A.

""QUOTA"" we considered, but U in position2 is invalid.

What if we put U not in position2? For example, ""QUOTA"" cannot because U is fixed in position2.

But we can have words where U is in position1,3,4,5 (except 2).

Similarly, O in 1,2,3,4 (except 5).

A in 2,4,5.

Let me list possible words:

- ""OUIJA"" - O-U-I-J-A, but I is absent (from guess2), so invalid.

""JOUAL"" not common.

""LOUMA"" not common.

""MOULA"" not common.

""PULAO"" - P-U-L-A-O. This might be a word? Pulao is a rice dish. Let's consider: P-U-L-A-O.

Letters: P, U, L, A, O.

Check absent: P, L are available? C,R,N,E,D,I absent, so P and L are okay.

Now positions:
- P at 1
- U at 2: but U cannot be in position2 (from guess2 feedback: U(-) in position2). So U in position2 is invalid.

""PULAO"" has U in position2, not allowed.

""PODIA"" has D and I, absent.

""SOLAR"" has R and L, but R absent.

""VOLAR"" not common and R absent.

""YOGAS"" no U.

Perhaps ""AULOI"" but I is absent.

This is tricky.

Another word: ""FACET"" but C and E absent.

Not.

""GAMUT"" has M, A, U, T. But no O? We need O.

We must have O.

""GAUDY"" has G,A,U,D,Y. D is absent, so invalid.

""HAUTE"" has E.

""JUMAR"" has R.

""KAPUT"" no O.

""LAUAN"" has N, absent.

""MAUDS"" has D and S, but D absent.

""PAUSE"" has E.

""SAULT"" has S,A,U,L,T. But no O? And L and T. But O is missing.

""SAULT"" is a word, but it doesn't have O, but we know O is in the word.

From guess2, O is present, so it must be in the word.

Similarly, U and A.

So we need a word with A, U, O.

Let me search for common words with A, U, O.

Examples: 
- ""CAROL"" but C and R absent.
- ""FLOUR"" R absent.
- ""SOUTH"" no A.
- ""AUDIO"" already used.
- ""DOULA"" D absent.
- ""GOUDA"" D absent.
- ""JOUST"" no A.
- ""POUCH"" C absent.
- ""ROUSE"" R and E absent.
- ""ROUND"" R and D and N absent.
- ""SCOUR"" S,C,R absent.
- ""SHOUT"" no A.
- ""SQUAD"" D absent.
- ""TOUCH"" C absent.
- ""VOUCH"" C absent.
- ""WOULD"" W,O,U,L,D - D absent.
- ""COUPE"" C and E absent.
- ""FJORD"" F,J,O,R,D - R and D absent.
- ""GHOUL"" G,H,O,U,L - no A.
- ""YOUTH"" no A.

This is difficult. Maybe there are less common words.

Another idea: ""OUZEL"" has E and no A.

""UKASE"" has E.

""URAEI"" not common.

""USUAL"" no O.

""VODKA"" V,O,D,K,A - D absent.

""VOLTA"" V,O,L,T,A - has O and A, but no U. We need U.

""WACKO"" W,A,C,K,O - C absent.

""WAUGH"" W,A,U,G,H - has A and U, no O.

""YAUDS"" Y,A,U,D,S - D absent.

""YOGAS"" no U.

Perhaps ""OAKUM"" O,A,K,U,M - has O, A, U. And K and M.

Letters: O, A, K, U, M.

Check absent: K and M are available.

Positions: O at 1, A at 2, K at 3, U at 4, M at 5.

Now, check constraints:

- A is in position2: allowed (A can be 2,4,5)
- U is in position4: allowed (U can be 1,3,4,5) and not 2, so position4 is fine.
- O is in position1: allowed (O can be 1,2,3,4) and not 5, so position1 is fine.

Also, no forbidden letters.

So ""OAKUM"" is a valid word? Oakum is a material, so it should be acceptable.

We can use this.

Another word: ""KAPOK"" no U.

""MAUVE"" has E.

""OCTAN"" has C and N.

""OAKUM"" seems good.

""SUMAC"" has C, absent.

""TOLAR"" has R.

""UMIAC"" not common.

""UNCAP"" has N and C.

So I think ""OAKUM"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's confirm the spelling: O-A-K-U-M, yes.

Now, this will test:
- O in position1: if correct, we get ✓, else if present but wrong, -, etc.
- A in position2: if correct, ✓, else -.
- K in position3: new letter.
- U in position4: if correct, ✓, else -.
- M in position5: new letter.

And we know A, U, O are present, so we might get more position info.

If we get all correct, great, but likely not.

Another option: ""AULOS"" but S, and O? A-U-L-O-S. But L and S. And O in position4.

A in position1: but A cannot be in position1 (from guess2 feedback: A(-) in position1). So A in position1 is invalid. ""AULOS"" has A in position1, not allowed.

Similarly, ""OASIS"" no U.

So ""OAKUM"" seems a good choice.

Perhaps ""LOACH"" but C absent.

I think we should go with ""OAKUM"".

But let's see if there's a more common word.

""JUMBO"" has B, O, but no A or U? J-U-M-B-O, has U and O, no A. We need A.

""PUMAS"" has S, A, U, but no O. P-U-M-A-S.

No O.

""QUASI"" has Q, U, A, S, I. But I is absent, so invalid.

""SULFA"" has S,U,L,F,A, no O.

""TALUS"" has T,A,L,U,S, no O.

""UKASE"" has E.

So I think ""OAKUM"" is acceptable.

Therefore, our third guess is ""OAKUM"".

<guess>oakum</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, R, N, E are absent (x), and A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is present but not in position 1 (-), U is present but not in position 2 (-), D and I are absent (x), and O is present but not in position 5 (-).

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: A, U, O (all must appear, but not in the positions guessed).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, D, I (cannot be used).
- **Position constraints**:
  - A cannot be in position 1 or 3 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).
  - U cannot be in position 2 (must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5).
  - O cannot be in position 5 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- **Available letters**: All letters except C, R, N, E, D, I. Common choices include consonants like B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y and vowels like A, O, U.
- **Objective**: Choose a word that includes A, U, O (in allowed positions) and two new letters to maximize information.

### Thought Process:
- The word must contain A, U, and O, with A not in pos 1/3, U not in pos 2, and O not in pos 5.
- After evaluating options (e.g., ""QUOTA"" invalid due to U in pos 2, ""VAULT"" missing O, ""OUIJA"" has absent I), ""OAKUM"" (a valid word for tarred fiber) fits:
  - O in position 1 (allowed, as O cannot be in 5).
  - A in position 2 (allowed, as A cannot be in 1/3).
  - K in position 3 (new letter, tests for presence).
  - U in position 4 (allowed, as U cannot be in 2).
  - M in position 5 (new letter, tests for presence).
- ""OAKUM"" uses common letters, avoids conflicts, and tests key positions for A, U, O.

This guess will help confirm positions of known letters and reveal if K or M are in the word.",Guess 3: oakum -> FEEDBACK: O(-) A(✓) K(x) U(-) M(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,BAYOU,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 3 consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E) which are common.
   - It doesn't repeat any letters.
   - It covers letters that frequently appear in English words.

 So, our first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the feedback from my first guess ""CRANE"" is: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x). Let me interpret this:

- C(x): C is not in the word.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- A(-): A is in the word but not in the correct position.
- N(x): N is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So, only 'A' is present in the secret word, and it's in the wrong position. The other letters C, R, N, E are absent.

Now, I need to make a new 5-letter word guess that includes 'A' but not C, R, N, E. Also, since 'A' is not in position 3 (where it was in ""CRANE""), I should place 'A' in a different position.

Positions in ""CRANE"":
1. C (absent)
2. R (absent)
3. A (present but wrong position)
4. N (absent)
5. E (absent)

Therefore, 'A' cannot be in position 3 of the secret word. It must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Since many letters are eliminated, I should think of a word that uses common English letters and includes 'A', avoiding C, R, N, E.

Available letters: I can use any letters except C, R, N, E. But 'A' must be included.

Common vowels besides E are O, I, U, etc. Consonants like T, S, L, M, D, P, etc.

A good starting point might be words like ""SLATE"" or ""PLATE"", but E is absent, so I can't use E. Also, S, L, T are common.

Let's list possible words that include 'A' and avoid C, R, N, E.

For example:
- ""ALERT"": But R and E are absent, so avoid.
- ""APPLE"": Has P, L, E; E is absent, so not good.
- ""TASTY"": Has T, S, Y; but has S and T, and A. Sounds possible.

But ""TASTY"" repeats T, which might not be ideal for maximizing information, but it's fine.

Since 'A' is in position 3 of ""CRANE"" and it's wrong, I should try 'A' in position 1,2,4 or 5.

Let me try position 1: words like ""ADIEU"", but E is absent, so avoid.

E is absent, so no words ending with E commonly.

Position 2: e.g., ""PAINT"" has N, which is absent, so invalid. N is absent, so avoid N.

Similarly, ""SAVOR"": S, A, V, O, R – but R is absent, so no.

R is absent, so I cannot use R.

Similarly, C, N, E absent.

So letters to avoid: C, R, N, E.

I can use: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

'A' must be included, and not in position 3.

Possible words:

- ""BASIC"": But C is absent, so no. C invalid.

BASIC has C and S, C absent.

- ""LATIN"": Has N absent.

No N.

"" SALAD "": Has L, A, D; positions: S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, A at 4, D at 5? But ""SALAD"" is 5 letters? S-A-L-A-D, yes. But it has A in position 2 and 4. Since A is present, but we don't know if it repeats or not. But feedback only said A is present, didn't specify quantity, so it could be once or twice.

But for guess, minimizing unknown letters is good.

Better to use a word with unique letters for more information.

So, let's try a word like ""PLAIT"" or ""SPAIL"" but SPAIL not common.

"" PIOUS "" no A.

"" AUDIO "": A,U,D,I,O – this has A in position 1, U,D,I,O new letters.

""AUDIO"" could be good because it has vowels and includes A not in position 3.

Position 1 of ""AUDIO"" is A.

Now, A was position 3 in previous guess, wrong position, so if A is in position 1 here, and if it's correct, we get info.

Similarly, other positions.

""AUDIO"": letters A,U,D,I,O.

None of U,D,I,O are known absent yet, except C,R,N,E absent.

So, ""AUDIO"" could give good feedback.

Another option: ""SWAMP"": S,W,A,M,P – but M and P possible.

Both seem fine.

Since only one letter known present, I should aim for words with A in different position and common letters.

Position 3 is excluded for A, so try position 2 or 4.

For example, ""PLANT"" has N, absent.

No N or E.

"" TABLE "" has E, absent.

No E.

"" STALK "": S,T,A,L,K – sounds possible. A in position 3? Position:1-S,2-T,3-A,4-L,5-K.

But in previous, A was in position 3 and feedback said wrong position, so if I put A in position 3 again, it will likely be wrong again, but I need to avoid position 3 for A.

In ""STALK"", A is in position 3, same as before, so since we know it's wrong position, putting it there might not help. Better to put A in a different position.

So position 1: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ADULT"", ""AWARD"" etc.

""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T – includes O,U,T,B.

""ADULT"": A,D,U,L,T – includes D,U,L,T.

""ALIKE"": has E? ""ALIKE"" ends with E, absent.

No words ending with E.

"" AUDIO "" is A,U,D,I,O – all new letters except A.

Similarly, ""OUGHT"" no A.

I think ""AUDIO"" is a strong choice because it uses vowels and can confirm positions.

Another one: ""SAUCE"" but C absent, invalid.

So ""AUDIO"" seems good.

But let's check if ""AUDIO"" is a valid word; yes, it is.

Similarly, ""MEDIA"" has E, absent.

So yes.

Perhaps ""KARMA"" or something.

But ""KARMA"" has K,A,R,M,A – R is absent, so invalid. R absent.

Cannot use R.

So ""AUDIO"" avoids forbidden letters.

Therefore, I'll go with ""AUDIO"" as my second guess.

Feedback will tell: if A is in position 1 or not, and presence of U,D,I,O.

In format: I need to output <guess>audio</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- C, R, N, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").

Therefore, the new guess must:
- Include the letter ""A"" (since it's confirmed to be in the word).
- Avoid the letters C, R, N, and E.
- Place ""A"" in a position other than 3 (e.g., positions 1, 2, 4, or 5) to gather new information.
- Use common English letters to maximize the chance of hitting present letters.

A good choice is ""AUDIO"" because:
- It contains ""A"" placed in position 1, testing a new location.
- It introduces new common vowels (U, I, O) and a consonant (D), which could provide valuable feedback.
- It avoids all excluded letters (C, R, N, E).

This guess will help narrow down the position of ""A"" and identify if any of U, D, I, or O are in the word.

<guess>audio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(-) D(x) I(x) O(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, N, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> A(-), U(-), D(x), I(x), O(-)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we placed it in position 1 and got ""-"").
- U is in the word but not in position 2 (where we placed it).
- D is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 5 (where we placed it).

So, from both guesses, we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, D, I.

Letters that ARE in the word: A, U, O (and we know they are present from the feedback).

Additionally, we know the positions that are incorrect for A, U, and O:
- A cannot be in position 1 or 3.
- U cannot be in position 2.
- O cannot be in position 5.

We also know that the word must contain at least three distinct letters: A, U, O. Since we have 5 letters, there are two more letters to find.

Now, let's list the known absent letters: C, R, N, E, D, I.

Available letters: all letters except C, R, N, E, D, I.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes A, U, O and two other letters from the available set.

Also, we must place A, U, O in positions that are not forbidden for them.

Forbidden positions:
- A: not 1 or 3 -> so A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- U: not 2 -> so U can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- O: not 5 -> so O can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: the word has 5 positions, and we have three letters that must be placed without conflicting.

We also need to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But so far, no feedback suggests that, so we assume no repeats for now to maximize information.

Now, let's think of common words that contain A, U, O and avoid the absent letters.

Available consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Available vowels: A, U, O (and we have Y which can be a vowel too).

We need two more letters. Let's try to pick common ones.

Possible words:

- ""ABOUT"": But we have B, O, U, T. However, we know A must be in the word, and ""ABOUT"" has A? No, ""ABOUT"" is A-B-O-U-T. But we have A, B, O, U, T. But in our feedback, we know A is in the word, but in ""ABOUT"", A is in position 1. However, from guess2, A cannot be in position 1 (because we had A in position1 and got ""-""). So ""ABOUT"" would have A in position1 which is invalid. Also, we have O and U, but we need to place them correctly.

Alternatively, ""AUDIO"" we already tried.

Another word: ""QUOTA"" but Q is available? Q is available, but let's see: Q-U-O-T-A. But we have U and O and A. Positions: Q(1), U(2), O(3), T(4), A(5). Now, check the constraints:

- A is in position 5: allowed (since A can be in 2,4,5)
- U is in position 2: but from guess2, U cannot be in position 2 (because we had U in position2 and got ""-""). So U cannot be in position2. Therefore, ""QUOTA"" has U in position2, which is invalid.

Similarly, ""SOUTH"": S-O-U-T-H. But O is in position2, U in position3, and no A. But we need A in the word. So invalid.

We must include A.

""FLOUR"": F-L-O-U-R, but R is absent (from guess1), so invalid.

""VAULT"": V-A-U-L-T. Let's check:
- A is in position2: allowed (A can be 2,4,5)
- U is in position3: allowed (U can be 1,3,4,5)
- O is not in this word? But we know O is in the word from feedback. Guess2 had O and it was marked as present (O(-)), so O must be in the word. ""VAULT"" has no O, so invalid.

We need a word that has A, U, and O.

Possible words: ""ALOUD"", ""CLOUD"", but C and D are absent. C absent from guess1, D absent from guess2.

""GOUDA"": G-O-U-D-A, but D is absent, so invalid.

""JOUST"": J-O-U-S-T, no A.

""MOUTH"": M-O-U-T-H, no A.

""OUTTA"" not a word.

""POUCH"": P-O-U-C-H, C absent.

""QUAFF"": Q-U-A-F-F, has A and U, but no O? We need O. And F repeated? Also, O is missing.

We must have O.

""SOAPY"": S-O-A-P-Y, has O and A, but no U. We need U.

Similarly, ""BOAST"": B-O-A-S-T, has O and A, no U.

We need a word with A, U, O.

Let me think: ""AUDIO"" we already used, but that had D and I which are absent.

Another word: ""KAPUT""? K-A-P-U-T, has A and U, no O.

""MANOR"" has R and N, absent.

""MAUVE"" has E, absent.

""SAUNA"" has S,A,U,N,A. N is absent, and no O.

""SAUCE"" has C, absent.

""TAUPE"" has E, absent.

""UKASE"" has E, absent.

""ULYSS"" not a word.

""UMIAC"" not common.

""URAEI"" not common.

""USUAL"" has U,A,L, but no O? And S? ""USUAL"" is U-S-U-A-L, has U and A, but no O. And we have two U's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but feedback didn't indicate multiple, so we assume one of each for now.

But we need O.

Perhaps ""DOULA"" but D is absent.

""FOULE"" has E and no A? F-O-U-L-E.

Not working.

Another idea: ""OCTAD"" has C and D absent.

""OUZEL"" has E and Z, but no A.

""QUOTA"" we considered, but U in position2 is invalid.

What if we put U not in position2? For example, ""QUOTA"" cannot because U is fixed in position2.

But we can have words where U is in position1,3,4,5 (except 2).

Similarly, O in 1,2,3,4 (except 5).

A in 2,4,5.

Let me list possible words:

- ""OUIJA"" - O-U-I-J-A, but I is absent (from guess2), so invalid.

""JOUAL"" not common.

""LOUMA"" not common.

""MOULA"" not common.

""PULAO"" - P-U-L-A-O. This might be a word? Pulao is a rice dish. Let's consider: P-U-L-A-O.

Letters: P, U, L, A, O.

Check absent: P, L are available? C,R,N,E,D,I absent, so P and L are okay.

Now positions:
- P at 1
- U at 2: but U cannot be in position2 (from guess2 feedback: U(-) in position2). So U in position2 is invalid.

""PULAO"" has U in position2, not allowed.

""PODIA"" has D and I, absent.

""SOLAR"" has R and L, but R absent.

""VOLAR"" not common and R absent.

""YOGAS"" no U.

Perhaps ""AULOI"" but I is absent.

This is tricky.

Another word: ""FACET"" but C and E absent.

Not.

""GAMUT"" has M, A, U, T. But no O? We need O.

We must have O.

""GAUDY"" has G,A,U,D,Y. D is absent, so invalid.

""HAUTE"" has E.

""JUMAR"" has R.

""KAPUT"" no O.

""LAUAN"" has N, absent.

""MAUDS"" has D and S, but D absent.

""PAUSE"" has E.

""SAULT"" has S,A,U,L,T. But no O? And L and T. But O is missing.

""SAULT"" is a word, but it doesn't have O, but we know O is in the word.

From guess2, O is present, so it must be in the word.

Similarly, U and A.

So we need a word with A, U, O.

Let me search for common words with A, U, O.

Examples: 
- ""CAROL"" but C and R absent.
- ""FLOUR"" R absent.
- ""SOUTH"" no A.
- ""AUDIO"" already used.
- ""DOULA"" D absent.
- ""GOUDA"" D absent.
- ""JOUST"" no A.
- ""POUCH"" C absent.
- ""ROUSE"" R and E absent.
- ""ROUND"" R and D and N absent.
- ""SCOUR"" S,C,R absent.
- ""SHOUT"" no A.
- ""SQUAD"" D absent.
- ""TOUCH"" C absent.
- ""VOUCH"" C absent.
- ""WOULD"" W,O,U,L,D - D absent.
- ""COUPE"" C and E absent.
- ""FJORD"" F,J,O,R,D - R and D absent.
- ""GHOUL"" G,H,O,U,L - no A.
- ""YOUTH"" no A.

This is difficult. Maybe there are less common words.

Another idea: ""OUZEL"" has E and no A.

""UKASE"" has E.

""URAEI"" not common.

""USUAL"" no O.

""VODKA"" V,O,D,K,A - D absent.

""VOLTA"" V,O,L,T,A - has O and A, but no U. We need U.

""WACKO"" W,A,C,K,O - C absent.

""WAUGH"" W,A,U,G,H - has A and U, no O.

""YAUDS"" Y,A,U,D,S - D absent.

""YOGAS"" no U.

Perhaps ""OAKUM"" O,A,K,U,M - has O, A, U. And K and M.

Letters: O, A, K, U, M.

Check absent: K and M are available.

Positions: O at 1, A at 2, K at 3, U at 4, M at 5.

Now, check constraints:

- A is in position2: allowed (A can be 2,4,5)
- U is in position4: allowed (U can be 1,3,4,5) and not 2, so position4 is fine.
- O is in position1: allowed (O can be 1,2,3,4) and not 5, so position1 is fine.

Also, no forbidden letters.

So ""OAKUM"" is a valid word? Oakum is a material, so it should be acceptable.

We can use this.

Another word: ""KAPOK"" no U.

""MAUVE"" has E.

""OCTAN"" has C and N.

""OAKUM"" seems good.

""SUMAC"" has C, absent.

""TOLAR"" has R.

""UMIAC"" not common.

""UNCAP"" has N and C.

So I think ""OAKUM"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's confirm the spelling: O-A-K-U-M, yes.

Now, this will test:
- O in position1: if correct, we get ✓, else if present but wrong, -, etc.
- A in position2: if correct, ✓, else -.
- K in position3: new letter.
- U in position4: if correct, ✓, else -.
- M in position5: new letter.

And we know A, U, O are present, so we might get more position info.

If we get all correct, great, but likely not.

Another option: ""AULOS"" but S, and O? A-U-L-O-S. But L and S. And O in position4.

A in position1: but A cannot be in position1 (from guess2 feedback: A(-) in position1). So A in position1 is invalid. ""AULOS"" has A in position1, not allowed.

Similarly, ""OASIS"" no U.

So ""OAKUM"" seems a good choice.

Perhaps ""LOACH"" but C absent.

I think we should go with ""OAKUM"".

But let's see if there's a more common word.

""JUMBO"" has B, O, but no A or U? J-U-M-B-O, has U and O, no A. We need A.

""PUMAS"" has S, A, U, but no O. P-U-M-A-S.

No O.

""QUASI"" has Q, U, A, S, I. But I is absent, so invalid.

""SULFA"" has S,U,L,F,A, no O.

""TALUS"" has T,A,L,U,S, no O.

""UKASE"" has E.

So I think ""OAKUM"" is acceptable.

Therefore, our third guess is ""OAKUM"".

<guess>oakum</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, R, N, E are absent (x), and A is present but not in position 3 (-).
- **Guess 2 (""audio"")**: A is present but not in position 1 (-), U is present but not in position 2 (-), D and I are absent (x), and O is present but not in position 5 (-).

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: A, U, O (all must appear, but not in the positions guessed).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, D, I (cannot be used).
- **Position constraints**:
  - A cannot be in position 1 or 3 (must be in 2, 4, or 5).
  - U cannot be in position 2 (must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5).
  - O cannot be in position 5 (must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- **Available letters**: All letters except C, R, N, E, D, I. Common choices include consonants like B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y and vowels like A, O, U.
- **Objective**: Choose a word that includes A, U, O (in allowed positions) and two new letters to maximize information.

### Thought Process:
- The word must contain A, U, and O, with A not in pos 1/3, U not in pos 2, and O not in pos 5.
- After evaluating options (e.g., ""QUOTA"" invalid due to U in pos 2, ""VAULT"" missing O, ""OUIJA"" has absent I), ""OAKUM"" (a valid word for tarred fiber) fits:
  - O in position 1 (allowed, as O cannot be in 5).
  - A in position 2 (allowed, as A cannot be in 1/3).
  - K in position 3 (new letter, tests for presence).
  - U in position 4 (allowed, as U cannot be in 2).
  - M in position 5 (new letter, tests for presence).
- ""OAKUM"" uses common letters, avoids conflicts, and tests key positions for A, U, O.

This guess will help confirm positions of known letters and reveal if K or M are in the word.

The other letters C, R, N, E are absent.\n\nNow, I need to make a new 5-letter word guess that includes \'A\' but not C, R, N, E. Also, since \'A\' is not in position 3 (where it was in ""CRANE""), I should place \'A\' in a different position.\n\nPositions in ""CRANE"":\n1. C (absent)\n2. R (absent)\n3. A (present but wrong position)\n4. N (absent)\n5. E (absent)\n\nTherefore, \'A\' cannot be in position 3 of the secret word.

But \'A\' must be included.\n\nCommon vowels besides E are O, I, U, etc. Consonants like T, S, L, M, D, P, etc.\n\nA good starting point might be words like ""SLATE"" or ""PLATE"", but E is absent, so I can\'t use E. Also, S, L, T are common.\n\nLet\'s list possible words that include \'A\' and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\nFor example:\n- ""ALERT"": But R and E are absent, so avoid.\n- ""APPLE"": Has P, L, E; E is absent, so not good.\n- ""TASTY"": Has T, S, Y; but has S and T, and A. Sounds possible.\n\nBut ""TASTY"" repeats T, which might not be ideal for maximizing information, but it\'s fine.\n\nSince \'A\' is in position 3 of ""CRANE"" and it\'s wrong, I should try \'A\' in position 1,2,4 or 5.\n\nLet me try position 1: words like ""ADIEU"", but E is absent, so avoid.\n\nE is absent, so no words ending with E commonly.\n\nPosition 2: e.g., ""PAINT"" has N, which is absent, so invalid. N is absent, so avoid N.\n\nSimilarly, ""SAVOR"": S, A, V, O, R – but R is absent, so no.\n\nR is absent, so I cannot use R.\n\nSimilarly, C, N, E absent.\n\nSo letters to avoid: C, R, N, E.\n\nI can use: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n\'A\' must be included, and not in position 3.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""BASIC"": But C is absent, so no.

But feedback only said A is present, didn\'t specify quantity, so it could be once or twice.\n\nBut for guess, minimizing unknown letters is good.\n\nBetter to use a word with unique letters for more information.\n\nSo, let\'s try a word like ""PLAIT"" or ""SPAIL"" but SPAIL not common.\n\n"" PIOUS "" no A.\n\n"" AUDIO "": A,U,D,I,O – this has A in position 1, U,D,I,O new letters.\n\n""AUDIO"" could be good because it has vowels and includes A not in position 3.\n\nPosition 1 of ""AUDIO"" is A.\n\nNow, A was position 3 in previous guess, wrong position, so if A is in position 1 here, and if it\'s correct, we get info.\n\nSimilarly, other positions.\n\n""AUDIO"": letters A,U,D,I,O.\n\nNone of U,D,I,O are known absent yet, except C,R,N,E absent.\n\nSo, ""AUDIO"" could give good feedback.\n\nAnother option: ""SWAMP"": S,W,A,M,P – but M and P possible.\n\nBoth seem fine.\n\nSince only one letter known present, I should aim for words with A in different position and common letters.\n\nPosition 3 is excluded for A, so try position 2 or 4.\n\nFor example, ""PLANT"" has N, absent.\n\nNo N or E.\n\n"" TABLE "" has E, absent.\n\nNo E.\n\n"" STALK "": S,T,A,L,K – sounds possible. A in position 3? Position:1-S,2-T,3-A,4-L,5-K.\n\nBut in previous, A was in position 3 and feedback said wrong position, so if I put A in position 3 again, it will likely be wrong again, but I need to avoid position 3 for A.\n\nIn ""STALK"", A is in position 3, same as before, so since we know it\'s wrong position, putting it there might not help. Better to put A in a different position.\n\nSo position 1: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ADULT"", ""AWARD"" etc.\n\n""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T – includes O,U,T,B.\n\n""ADULT"": A,D,U,L,T – includes D,U,L,T.\n\n""ALIKE"": has E? ""ALIKE"" ends with E, absent.\n\nNo words ending with E.\n\n"" AUDIO "" is A,U,D,I,O – all new letters except A.\n\nSimilarly, ""OUGHT"" no A.\n\nI think ""AUDIO"" is a strong choice because it uses vowels and can confirm positions.\n\nAnother one: ""SAUCE"" but C absent, invalid.\n\nSo ""AUDIO"" seems good.\n\nBut let\'s check if ""AUDIO"" is a valid word; yes, it is.\n\nSimilarly, ""MEDIA"" has E, absent.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps ""KARMA"" or something.\n\nBut ""KARMA"" has K,A,R,M,A – R is absent, so invalid.

Let\'s try to pick common ones.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""ABOUT"": But we have B, O, U, T. However, we know A must be in the word, and ""ABOUT"" has A? No, ""ABOUT"" is A-B-O-U-T. But we have A, B, O, U, T. But in our feedback, we know A is in the word, but in ""ABOUT"", A is in position 1. However, from guess2, A cannot be in position 1 (because we had A in position1 and got ""-""). So ""ABOUT"" would have A in position1 which is invalid. Also, we have O and U, but we need to place them correctly.\n\nAlternatively, ""AUDIO"" we already tried.\n\nAnother word: ""QUOTA"" but Q is available? Q is available, but let\'s see: Q-U-O-T-A.

Now, check the constraints:\n\n- A is in position 5: allowed (since A can be in 2,4,5)\n- U is in position 2: but from guess2, U cannot be in position 2 (because we had U in position2 and got ""-""). So U cannot be in position2. Therefore, ""QUOTA"" has U in position2, which is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""SOUTH"": S-O-U-T-H. But O is in position2, U in position3, and no A. But we need A in the word.

""AULOS"" has A in position1, not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""OASIS"" no U.\n\nSo ""OAKUM"" seems a good choice.\n\nPerhaps ""LOACH"" but C absent.\n\nI think we should go with ""OAKUM"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a more common word.\n\n""JUMBO"" has B, O, but no A or U?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
- Absent: C, R, N, E
- Present but wrong position: A (not in position 3)

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> A(-), U(-), D(x), I(x), O(-)
- Absent: D, I
- Present but wrong position: A (not in position 1), U (not in position 2), O (not in position 5)

Guess 3: ""oakum"" -> O(-), A(✓), K(x), U(-), M(x)
- Correct: A in position 2 (since A(✓) at position 2)
- Absent: K, M
- Present but wrong position: O (not in position 1), U (not in position 4)

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. **Correctly placed letters**:
   - A is in position 2. (from guess 3)

2. **Present letters (but position unknown or partially known)**:
   - O is in the word, but not in position 1 (from guess 3) and not in position 5 (from guess 2). So O must be in position 3 or 4? Let's see the positions.
   - U is in the word, but not in position 2 (from guess 2) and not in position 4 (from guess 3). So U must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, D, I, K, M. So we cannot use these.

4. **Available positions for O and U**:
   - Positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 (since position 2 is taken by A).
   - O cannot be in 1 or 5, so O must be in position 3 or 4.
   - U cannot be in 2 or 4, so U must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 positions, and we have:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- We need to place O and U in two of the remaining positions: 1,3,4,5, but with constraints.

Also, there are two more letters to find (since we have 5 letters total, and we know A, O, U are present, so two more).

But O and U are present, and A is present, so that's three. We need two additional letters.

Now, from the feedback, we know that in ""oakum"", O was in position 1 (wrong), A in position 2 (correct), U in position 4 (wrong). Also, K and M are absent.

So, since U is not in position 4, and O is not in position 1, and we have positions 1,3,4,5 open for O and U and the two new letters.

But position 2 is fixed as A.

Now, let's list the constraints for O and U:

- O: must be in position 3 or 4 (because not 1, not 5, and 2 is taken).
- U: must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (not 2, not 4).

But note: if O is in position 3, then U can be in 1 or 5 (since 3 is taken by O, and U cannot be in 4, so 1 or 5).
If O is in position 4, then U can be in 1, 3, or 5. But position 4 is taken by O, so U in 1,3,5.

However, we also have to place two more letters in the remaining positions.

Now, the word structure: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with 2=A.

We need to choose positions for O and U, and two new letters.

But we don't know which positions are for O and U yet.

Also, we need to avoid absent letters: C,R,N,E,D,I,K,M.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and O, U, but we know they are present, so we need to place them).

Now, since A is fixed at position 2, and we know O and U are present, we can think of words that have A in the second position.

Common words: e.g., ""BASTE"" but E absent, etc.

But we have constraints on O and U positions.

Let me list possible positions:

Case 1: O in position 3.
Then U must be in 1 or 5 (since 3 taken, and U cannot be in 4, and 2 taken).
- If U in 1, then positions 4 and 5 for new letters.
- If U in 5, then positions 1 and 4 for new letters.

Case 2: O in position 4.
Then U can be in 1, 3, or 5.
- If U in 1, then positions 3 and 5 for new letters.
- If U in 3, then positions 1 and 5 for new letters.
- If U in 5, then positions 1 and 3 for new letters.

Now, we need to choose a word that fits one of these and uses available letters.

Also, from guess 3, we have O not in 1 and U not in 4, which we already used.

Now, let's think of actual words.

First, since A is in position 2, words like:

- _ A _ _ _

With O and U present.

For example, if O in 3 and U in 1: U A O _ _

What words? ""UAPON"" not a word. ""UAKIT"" not.

""UAVAS"" not.

Not many common words.

U in 1 and O in 3: e.g., ""UAKTI"" not.

Perhaps not.

U in 5 and O in 3: _ A O _ U

Words: ""HALOU"" not, ""TALOU"" not, ""MANOU"" has N absent.

""BAJOU"" B-A-J-O-U? But J and O,U. Positions: B1, A2, J3, O4, U5? But we are considering O in position 3? In this case, if O in 3, then U in 5, so word: ?1 A2 O3 ?4 U5.

So ""?A O ? U""

Examples: ""HALOU"" not standard. ""TABOU"" T-A-B-O-U, but O is in position 4, not 3. We need O in position 3.

""RAGOU"" not.

""FALOU"" not.

""GABON"" has N absent.

Not working.

Now, case 2: O in position 4.

Then word: _ A _ O _

With U in 1,3, or 5.

First, U in 1: U A _ O _

Words: ""U A ? O ?""

Examples: ""UAPON"" not, ""UAKTI"" not.

""UAVOS"" not.

Not common.

U in 3: _ A U O _

Words: ""? A U O ?""

Examples: ""BAUDS"" but D absent. ""FAUGH"" F-A-U-G-H. ""GAUMS"" G-A-U-M-S, but M absent. ""HAULM"" H-A-U-L-M, M absent. ""JAUKS"" J-A-U-K-S, K absent. ""LAUFS"" L-A-U-F-S. ""PAULS"" P-A-U-L-S. ""SAULT"" S-A-U-L-T. ""VAULT"" V-A-U-L-T. ""WAULS"" W-A-U-L-S.

Now, from these, we need to avoid absent letters. Absent: C,R,N,E,D,I,K,M.

So ""SAULT"": S,A,U,L,T. L and T are available? L and T not in absent list, so okay. But O? We have O in position 4? In ""SAULT"", we have positions: S1, A2, U3, L4, T5. But we need O in position 4? Here position 4 is L, not O. We are considering O in position 4, so in the word, position 4 must be O.

In this case, for U in position 3 and O in position 4, the word is: ?1 A2 U3 O4 ?5.

So ""? A U O ?""

""SAULT"" is S-A-U-L-T, which is not ""? A U O ?"", it's S-A-U-L-T, so position 4 is L, not O.

We need position 4 to be O.

So words like ""BAUDO"" not a word. ""GAUDO"" not. ""JAUPS"" J-A-U-P-S, no O. ""KAUFS"" K absent. ""MAUDS"" D absent. ""PAULS"" no O. ""SAUCE"" C absent. ""TAUON"" not common. ""VAUCH"" not.

""WAUGH"" W-A-U-G-H, no O.

Not many options.

U in 5: _ A _ O U

Words: ""? A ? O U""

Examples: ""BALOU"" not, ""FALOU"" not, ""HALOU"" not, ""TALOU"" not, ""MANOU"" N absent.

""RAJOU"" R absent.

""TABOU"" T-A-B-O-U, which is a word? Tabou means taboo in French, but in English, it might be accepted. Let's assume it is.

""TABOU"": T1, A2, B3, O4, U5.

Now, check constraints:
- O is in position 4: allowed (O can be in 4, since not 5 and not 1, and 2 taken, so 3 or 4, so 4 is okay).
- U is in position 5: allowed (U can be in 5, since not 2 or 4, and 5 is allowed).
- A in position 2: correct.

Also, letters: T, B are available? T and B not absent.

But we have O in position 4 and U in position 5.

In this word, we have T, A, B, O, U.

But we need to confirm if ""TABOU"" is valid. In Wordle, it might be accepted as a variant of ""taboo"", but typically ""taboo"" has double O, but ""tabou"" is a spelling.

To be safe, let's find another word.

Another possibility: ""HABOU"" not a word.

""KABOU"" not.

""LABOU"" not.

""SABOU"" not.

""TABOO"" has double O, but it's 5 letters? T-A-B-O-O, which has O twice, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. In feedback, we haven't seen duplicates, but it's possible.

""TABOO"": T1, A2, B3, O4, O5. But position 5 is O, but from guess2, O cannot be in position 5 (O(-) in position5). So O in position5 is invalid. Therefore, ""TABOO"" would have O in position5, which is forbidden.

Similarly, any word with O in position5 is not allowed.

In ""TABOU"", U is in position5, which is allowed, and O in position4.

But ""TABOU"" might not be common.

Another word: ""BAYOU"" B-A-Y-O-U. Positions: B1, A2, Y3, O4, U5.

This is a common word, bayou.

Check:
- B1: new letter
- A2: correct
- Y3: new letter
- O4: O in position4, allowed (since O can be in 4)
- U5: U in position5, allowed (U can be in 5)

Letters: B, A, Y, O, U. All present except A,O,U which are known, and B and Y are available.

Absent letters don't include B or Y.

So ""BAYOU"" seems perfect.

Now, confirm the constraints:
- O is in position4: yes, and it's allowed because O cannot be in 1 or 5, and 2 is taken, so 3 or 4, so 4 is fine.
- U is in position5: allowed because U cannot be in 2 or 4, and 5 is allowed.

Also, we have A in position2 fixed.

So ""BAYOU"" should be a valid guess.

If we get feedback, we might solve it.

But is there a possibility of other words?

For example, if O is in position3, we might have words like ""HAOLE"" but E absent, or ""PAOLI"" I absent, etc.

But ""BAYOU"" seems straightforward.

Another option: ""GAMBO"" no U.

I think ""BAYOU"" is good.

So we'll guess ""BAYOU"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
     - C, R, N, E are absent (x).
     - A is present but not in position 3 (-).
   - **Guess 2 (""audio"")**:
     - A is present but not in position 1 (-).
     - U is present but not in position 2 (-).
     - D and I are absent (x).
     - O is present but not in position 5 (-).
   - **Guess 3 (""oakum"")**:
     - O is present but not in position 1 (-).
     - A is correct in position 2 (✓) — this is fixed.
     - K and M are absent (x).
     - U is present but not in position 4 (-).

2. **Consolidate Known Information**:
   - **Correctly Placed Letters**:
     - A is in position 2 (from Guess 3).
   - **Present Letters (Wrong Position)**:
     - O must be in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 (from Guess 2 and 3). Since position 2 is taken by A, O must be in position 3 or 4.
     - U must be in the word but not in positions 2 or 4 (from Guess 2 and 3). Thus, U must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
   - **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, D, I, K, M (cannot be used).
   - **Available Letters**: B, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - **Word Structure**: The word has A in position 2. Positions 1, 3, 4, and 5 must contain O, U, and two new letters from the available set.

3. **Position Constraints for O and U**:
   - O must be in position 3 or 4.
   - U must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
   - Since O and U cannot share the same position, we consider cases:
     - If O is in position 3, U must be in 1 or 5.
     - If O is in position 4, U must be in 1, 3, or 5.
   - We need to choose a word that satisfies one of these cases and uses available letters.

4. **Brainstorm Valid Words**:
   - Focus on common words with A in position 2 and including O and U.
   - Example: ""BAYOU"" (a marshy body of water, valid in Wordle dictionaries).
     - Structure: B (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), Y (position 3), O (position 4), U (position 5).
     - Checks constraints:
       - O is in position 4 (allowed, since O cannot be in 1 or 5).
       - U is in position 5 (allowed, since U cannot be in 2 or 4).
       - Uses available letters (B, Y not absent).
   - Other options like ""TABOU"" (less common) or ""SAULT"" (lacks O in required position) were considered but rejected in favor of a more common word.

5. **Why ""BAYOU""?**:
   - Maximizes information: Tests O in position 4 and U in position 5, which are plausible given constraints.
   - Uses new common letters (B, Y) to check for presence.
   - Avoids all absent letters.
   - If correct, solves the word; if not, feedback will reveal positions for O and U and presence of B/Y.

<guess>bayou</guess>",bayou,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
- Absent: C, R, N, E
- Present but wrong position: A (not in position 3)

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> A(-), U(-), D(x), I(x), O(-)
- Absent: D, I
- Present but wrong position: A (not in position 1), U (not in position 2), O (not in position 5)

Guess 3: ""oakum"" -> O(-), A(✓), K(x), U(-), M(x)
- Correct: A in position 2 (since A(✓) at position 2)
- Absent: K, M
- Present but wrong position: O (not in position 1), U (not in position 4)

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. **Correctly placed letters**:
   - A is in position 2. (from guess 3)

2. **Present letters (but position unknown or partially known)**:
   - O is in the word, but not in position 1 (from guess 3) and not in position 5 (from guess 2). So O must be in position 3 or 4? Let's see the positions.
   - U is in the word, but not in position 2 (from guess 2) and not in position 4 (from guess 3). So U must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

3. **Absent letters**: C, R, N, E, D, I, K, M. So we cannot use these.

4. **Available positions for O and U**:
   - Positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 (since position 2 is taken by A).
   - O cannot be in 1 or 5, so O must be in position 3 or 4.
   - U cannot be in 2 or 4, so U must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 positions, and we have:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- We need to place O and U in two of the remaining positions: 1,3,4,5, but with constraints.

Also, there are two more letters to find (since we have 5 letters total, and we know A, O, U are present, so two more).

But O and U are present, and A is present, so that's three. We need two additional letters.

Now, from the feedback, we know that in ""oakum"", O was in position 1 (wrong), A in position 2 (correct), U in position 4 (wrong). Also, K and M are absent.

So, since U is not in position 4, and O is not in position 1, and we have positions 1,3,4,5 open for O and U and the two new letters.

But position 2 is fixed as A.

Now, let's list the constraints for O and U:

- O: must be in position 3 or 4 (because not 1, not 5, and 2 is taken).
- U: must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (not 2, not 4).

But note: if O is in position 3, then U can be in 1 or 5 (since 3 is taken by O, and U cannot be in 4, so 1 or 5).
If O is in position 4, then U can be in 1, 3, or 5. But position 4 is taken by O, so U in 1,3,5.

However, we also have to place two more letters in the remaining positions.

Now, the word structure: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with 2=A.

We need to choose positions for O and U, and two new letters.

But we don't know which positions are for O and U yet.

Also, we need to avoid absent letters: C,R,N,E,D,I,K,M.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and O, U, but we know they are present, so we need to place them).

Now, since A is fixed at position 2, and we know O and U are present, we can think of words that have A in the second position.

Common words: e.g., ""BASTE"" but E absent, etc.

But we have constraints on O and U positions.

Let me list possible positions:

Case 1: O in position 3.
Then U must be in 1 or 5 (since 3 taken, and U cannot be in 4, and 2 taken).
- If U in 1, then positions 4 and 5 for new letters.
- If U in 5, then positions 1 and 4 for new letters.

Case 2: O in position 4.
Then U can be in 1, 3, or 5.
- If U in 1, then positions 3 and 5 for new letters.
- If U in 3, then positions 1 and 5 for new letters.
- If U in 5, then positions 1 and 3 for new letters.

Now, we need to choose a word that fits one of these and uses available letters.

Also, from guess 3, we have O not in 1 and U not in 4, which we already used.

Now, let's think of actual words.

First, since A is in position 2, words like:

- _ A _ _ _

With O and U present.

For example, if O in 3 and U in 1: U A O _ _

What words? ""UAPON"" not a word. ""UAKIT"" not.

""UAVAS"" not.

Not many common words.

U in 1 and O in 3: e.g., ""UAKTI"" not.

Perhaps not.

U in 5 and O in 3: _ A O _ U

Words: ""HALOU"" not, ""TALOU"" not, ""MANOU"" has N absent.

""BAJOU"" B-A-J-O-U? But J and O,U. Positions: B1, A2, J3, O4, U5? But we are considering O in position 3? In this case, if O in 3, then U in 5, so word: ?1 A2 O3 ?4 U5.

So ""?A O ? U""

Examples: ""HALOU"" not standard. ""TABOU"" T-A-B-O-U, but O is in position 4, not 3. We need O in position 3.

""RAGOU"" not.

""FALOU"" not.

""GABON"" has N absent.

Not working.

Now, case 2: O in position 4.

Then word: _ A _ O _

With U in 1,3, or 5.

First, U in 1: U A _ O _

Words: ""U A ? O ?""

Examples: ""UAPON"" not, ""UAKTI"" not.

""UAVOS"" not.

Not common.

U in 3: _ A U O _

Words: ""? A U O ?""

Examples: ""BAUDS"" but D absent. ""FAUGH"" F-A-U-G-H. ""GAUMS"" G-A-U-M-S, but M absent. ""HAULM"" H-A-U-L-M, M absent. ""JAUKS"" J-A-U-K-S, K absent. ""LAUFS"" L-A-U-F-S. ""PAULS"" P-A-U-L-S. ""SAULT"" S-A-U-L-T. ""VAULT"" V-A-U-L-T. ""WAULS"" W-A-U-L-S.

Now, from these, we need to avoid absent letters. Absent: C,R,N,E,D,I,K,M.

So ""SAULT"": S,A,U,L,T. L and T are available? L and T not in absent list, so okay. But O? We have O in position 4? In ""SAULT"", we have positions: S1, A2, U3, L4, T5. But we need O in position 4? Here position 4 is L, not O. We are considering O in position 4, so in the word, position 4 must be O.

In this case, for U in position 3 and O in position 4, the word is: ?1 A2 U3 O4 ?5.

So ""? A U O ?""

""SAULT"" is S-A-U-L-T, which is not ""? A U O ?"", it's S-A-U-L-T, so position 4 is L, not O.

We need position 4 to be O.

So words like ""BAUDO"" not a word. ""GAUDO"" not. ""JAUPS"" J-A-U-P-S, no O. ""KAUFS"" K absent. ""MAUDS"" D absent. ""PAULS"" no O. ""SAUCE"" C absent. ""TAUON"" not common. ""VAUCH"" not.

""WAUGH"" W-A-U-G-H, no O.

Not many options.

U in 5: _ A _ O U

Words: ""? A ? O U""

Examples: ""BALOU"" not, ""FALOU"" not, ""HALOU"" not, ""TALOU"" not, ""MANOU"" N absent.

""RAJOU"" R absent.

""TABOU"" T-A-B-O-U, which is a word? Tabou means taboo in French, but in English, it might be accepted. Let's assume it is.

""TABOU"": T1, A2, B3, O4, U5.

Now, check constraints:
- O is in position 4: allowed (O can be in 4, since not 5 and not 1, and 2 taken, so 3 or 4, so 4 is okay).
- U is in position 5: allowed (U can be in 5, since not 2 or 4, and 5 is allowed).
- A in position 2: correct.

Also, letters: T, B are available? T and B not absent.

But we have O in position 4 and U in position 5.

In this word, we have T, A, B, O, U.

But we need to confirm if ""TABOU"" is valid. In Wordle, it might be accepted as a variant of ""taboo"", but typically ""taboo"" has double O, but ""tabou"" is a spelling.

To be safe, let's find another word.

Another possibility: ""HABOU"" not a word.

""KABOU"" not.

""LABOU"" not.

""SABOU"" not.

""TABOO"" has double O, but it's 5 letters? T-A-B-O-O, which has O twice, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. In feedback, we haven't seen duplicates, but it's possible.

""TABOO"": T1, A2, B3, O4, O5. But position 5 is O, but from guess2, O cannot be in position 5 (O(-) in position5). So O in position5 is invalid. Therefore, ""TABOO"" would have O in position5, which is forbidden.

Similarly, any word with O in position5 is not allowed.

In ""TABOU"", U is in position5, which is allowed, and O in position4.

But ""TABOU"" might not be common.

Another word: ""BAYOU"" B-A-Y-O-U. Positions: B1, A2, Y3, O4, U5.

This is a common word, bayou.

Check:
- B1: new letter
- A2: correct
- Y3: new letter
- O4: O in position4, allowed (since O can be in 4)
- U5: U in position5, allowed (U can be in 5)

Letters: B, A, Y, O, U. All present except A,O,U which are known, and B and Y are available.

Absent letters don't include B or Y.

So ""BAYOU"" seems perfect.

Now, confirm the constraints:
- O is in position4: yes, and it's allowed because O cannot be in 1 or 5, and 2 is taken, so 3 or 4, so 4 is fine.
- U is in position5: allowed because U cannot be in 2 or 4, and 5 is allowed.

Also, we have A in position2 fixed.

So ""BAYOU"" should be a valid guess.

If we get feedback, we might solve it.

But is there a possibility of other words?

For example, if O is in position3, we might have words like ""HAOLE"" but E absent, or ""PAOLI"" I absent, etc.

But ""BAYOU"" seems straightforward.

Another option: ""GAMBO"" no U.

I think ""BAYOU"" is good.

So we'll guess ""BAYOU"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
     - C, R, N, E are absent (x).
     - A is present but not in position 3 (-).
   - **Guess 2 (""audio"")**:
     - A is present but not in position 1 (-).
     - U is present but not in position 2 (-).
     - D and I are absent (x).
     - O is present but not in position 5 (-).
   - **Guess 3 (""oakum"")**:
     - O is present but not in position 1 (-).
     - A is correct in position 2 (✓) — this is fixed.
     - K and M are absent (x).
     - U is present but not in position 4 (-).

2. **Consolidate Known Information**:
   - **Correctly Placed Letters**:
     - A is in position 2 (from Guess 3).
   - **Present Letters (Wrong Position)**:
     - O must be in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 (from Guess 2 and 3). Since position 2 is taken by A, O must be in position 3 or 4.
     - U must be in the word but not in positions 2 or 4 (from Guess 2 and 3). Thus, U must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
   - **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, E, D, I, K, M (cannot be used).
   - **Available Letters**: B, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - **Word Structure**: The word has A in position 2. Positions 1, 3, 4, and 5 must contain O, U, and two new letters from the available set.

3. **Position Constraints for O and U**:
   - O must be in position 3 or 4.
   - U must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
   - Since O and U cannot share the same position, we consider cases:
     - If O is in position 3, U must be in 1 or 5.
     - If O is in position 4, U must be in 1, 3, or 5.
   - We need to choose a word that satisfies one of these cases and uses available letters.

4. **Brainstorm Valid Words**:
   - Focus on common words with A in position 2 and including O and U.
   - Example: ""BAYOU"" (a marshy body of water, valid in Wordle dictionaries).
     - Structure: B (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), Y (position 3), O (position 4), U (position 5).
     - Checks constraints:
       - O is in position 4 (allowed, since O cannot be in 1 or 5).
       - U is in position 5 (allowed, since U cannot be in 2 or 4).
       - Uses available letters (B, Y not absent).
   - Other options like ""TABOU"" (less common) or ""SAULT"" (lacks O in required position) were considered but rejected in favor of a more common word.

5. **Why ""BAYOU""?**:
   - Maximizes information: Tests O in position 4 and U in position 5, which are plausible given constraints.
   - Uses new common letters (B, Y) to check for presence.
   - Avoids all absent letters.
   - If correct, solves the word; if not, feedback will reveal positions for O and U and presence of B/Y.",Guess 4: bayou -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) A(✓) Y(✓) O(✓) U(✓),SUCCESS
