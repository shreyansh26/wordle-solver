We are starting the game. We have no prior guesses, so we need to make an initial guess.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.
</think>
<thinking>
For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes the information I get about the secret word. A strong starting word typically includes common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to help identify which letters are present and their positions.

Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N). Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ROATE"" are popular openers because they cover multiple common letters.

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of identifying multiple correct letters in one guess.
- If any letters are correct (✓) or misplaced (-), it will provide valuable clues for narrowing down the secret word efficiently.

This guess will give feedback on the presence/position of C, R, A, N, and E in the secret word.

Now, I have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" gave C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-). This means:

- N is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 4, since N is the fourth letter in ""crane"").
- E is in the word but not in the correct position (position 5).
- C, R, and A are not in the secret word at all.

Secret word positions: _ _ _ N _ 

But E is somewhere else, not in position 5. Since E is misplaced, it must be in one of the first four positions.

Now, for my next guess, I need to choose a word that:

1. Has N in the fourth position to honor the correct position from feedback.
2. Includes E, but not in the fifth position.
3. Avoids C, R, and A entirely.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Since E is misplaced from position 5, it could be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since position 4 is taken by N, so E can't be there).

Let me think of words that have N in the fourth position and E somewhere else, while not using C, R, A.

Common letters I can use: S, T, L, O, D, I, M, P, etc.

Possible words: 

- Words ending with N: _ _ _ N _
With E: could be like ""SENT"", but that's 4 letters. Need 5 letters.

Five-letter words with N in position 4:

- E can be in position 1: e.g., ""EXIST"" no, fourth letter must be N? ""EXIST"" has S in fourth? Position: 1-E, 2-X, 3-I, 4-S, 5-T. Not.

List some words: 

Pattern: ? ? ? N ?

With E not in 5th, so E must be in 1,2 or 3.

Also, E could be in the word, so I need to include it.

Possible words:

- ""BLEND"": B L E N D → N is fourth? Positions: 1-B, 2-L, 3-E, 4-N, 5-D. E is in third position here? N is fourth? Yes, position 4 is N.

But ""BLEND"" has E in third. And we can use it, but does it avoid C,R,A? Yes, B,L,E,N,D.

- ""SPEND"": S P E N D → E in third, N fourth.

- ""SPINE"": S P I N E → I in third, N fourth, E fifth? But E is fifth, and our feedback said E is misplaced and not in fifth position, so E cannot be in fifth.

Important: E is not in position 5, so for the secret word, position 5 is not E. Therefore, in my guess, I should put E in a different position to test.

In ""SPINE"", if I put E in fifth, that might not be good because feedback said E is not in fifth, so guessing a word with E in fifth would get x or -, but since we know E is not in fifth, I should avoid placing E in fifth for now.

But in my guess, I can place E in other positions to check where it might be.

In ""BLEND"", E is in position 3.

Similarly, ""SPEND"" has E in 3.

What about other positions?

Possible: E in position 1: e.g., ""EATEN"" but has A, and we know A is not in word? Feedback was A(x), so A is not in word.

""EATEN"" has E in first, A in second? Positions: 1-E, 2-A, 3-T, 4-E, wait no, ""EATEN"" is E A T E N, so position 1-E, 2-A, 3-T, 4-E, 5-N. But we have N in fourth, so fourth position is E in this word? Not N.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

So, words with fourth letter N: like ? ? ? N ?

With E in position 1: examples? ""ELFIN"" — E L F I N, positions: 1-E, 2-L, 3-F, 4-I, 5-N? Fourth is I, not N.

Hard to find E in first with fourth N.

""EVENT"": E V E N T, positions: 1-E, 2-V, 3-E, 4-N, 5-T. Yes, N in fourth.

And E in first and third? But secret word has only one E? We don't know if there are multiple E's yet, but in the word ""EVENT"", it has E twice.

Similarly, ""EXIST"" not N in fourth.

""EBONY"": E B O N Y, position 4 is N? 1-E, 2-B, 3-O, 4-N, 5-Y. Yes.

Now, for ""EBONY"": it has E in first, B,O,N,Y. Avoid C,R,A? Yes. But O is new.

E in position 2: for example, ""MEANT"" has A, which is bad.

""SPENT"": S P E N T, E in third.

""HEIST"" but fourth letter S, not N.

""BEGIN"" has G and I, positions: B,E,G,I,N — position 1-B, 2-E, 3-G, 4-I, 5-N — not N in fourth.

What about ""BEING"": B,E,I,N,G — positions:1-B,2-E,3-I,4-N,5-G? Fourth is N? N is fourth letter.

""BEING"": 1-B, 2-E, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G. Yes, N in fourth position.

And E in second position.

Similarly, ""DEIGN"": D,E,I,G,N but fourth is G? Positions:1-D,2-E,3-I,4-G,5-N — no.

So possible words:

- ""BLEND"": L1=B, L2=L, L3=E, L4=N, L5=D
- ""SPEND"": L1=S, L2=P, L3=E, L4=N, L5=D
- ""EVENT"": L1=E, L2=V, L3=E, L4=N, L5=T — has E twice, but secret might not have multiple E.
- ""EBONY"": L1=E, L2=B, L3=O, L4=N, L5=Y
- ""BEING"": L1=B, L2=E, L3=I, L4=N, L5=G

Now, E is misplaced in the secret word. From feedback, since N is fixed in position 4, and E is not position 5, so E must be in 1,2 or 3.

With these words, I can test E in different positions.

For example:

- If I guess ""BLEND"", E in position 3.
- If I guess ""BEING"", E in position 2.

Also, I need to consider that C,R,A are absent, so avoid them.

Moreover, I can include other common letters to get more info.

Since E is misplaced, I might want to know where it is, so guessing words with E in various positions could help, but I have to guess one word.

Also, note that the secret word has E somewhere, and N in 4th.

Letters not in word: C, R, A are confirmed absent.

Possible letters to use: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

Common ones: S, T, L, O, I.

Perhaps I should prioritize words that have many of these common letters.

List:

- ""SPEND"": uses S,P,E,N,D — S and P are good.
- ""STONE"": S T O N E, but E in fifth? Position:1-S,2-T,3-O,4-N,5-E — but E in fifth, which we know is not correct since E cannot be in position 5 in secret. So if I guess this, position 5 E would be wrong, but it might test other letters. But it's inefficient because we know E is not in 5th. Better to guess a word with E not in 5th.

Similarly, ""SHONE"" has same issue.

""SPINE"": S P I N E, E in fifth — bad.

So avoid words with E in fifth.

Back to options:

- ""SPEND"": S P E N D — E in position 3, N in 4.
- ""BLEND"": B L E N D — E in 3.
- ""BEING"": B E I N G — E in position 2, N in 4.
- ""DEITY"" — not N in fourth.
- ""MEANY"" has A.

Another one: ""OPINE"" — O P I N E, E in fifth — no.

""LINEN"" — L I N E N, has N twice? Position:1-L,2-I,3-N,4-E,5-N — N in third and fifth, E in fourth. But our feedback has N correct only in position 4, so secret might have only one N or multiple, but position 4 is N for sure.

In ""LINEN"", position 4 is E, not N, so not.

""SKULK"" no E.

I think ""SPEND"" is a good candidate: uses S, P common letters.

Similarly, ""BLEND"" or ""BEING"".

But ""BEING"" has E in position 2, which I haven't tested.

Perhaps I should choose a word that doesn't put E in the same position as before to vary, but ""crane"" had E in position 5, now position 5 won't be E.

In new guess, E should be in 1,2, or 3.

To distinguish, I can choose one with E in 2 or 1.

For example, ""BEING"": E in position 2.

Or ""EBONY"": E in position 1.

""EBONY"" needs checking: E,B,O,N,Y.

O and Y are less common maybe.

S,T,L are more common.

""STENT"" — S T E N T, position 4 is N? Positions:1-S,2-T,3-E,4-N,5-T. E in third, N in fourth.

This uses S, T, E, N, T — T twice, but possible.

Similarly, ""SPENT"": S,P,E,N,T — similar to SPEND but T instead of D.

SPEND or SPENT.

""SPEND"" is valid word, yes.

But ""SPENT"" also valid.

Let me consider the letters.

Since E is misplaced, and I need to find its position, placing it in a different spot might help.

In previous, I don't know the position, so in this guess, let me put E in position 2, for example.

Word: ""BEING"" - letters B,E,I,N,G.

Not very common letters, but valid.

Another idea: ""BEGIN"" has G and I, positions as before.

""METRO"" but no N.

Need N in fourth.

Perhaps ""SLEET"" has E multiple, but fourth letter E? no.

I think ""BEING"" or ""SPEND"" are fine.

Another common word: ""THINE"" — T H I N E, E in fifth — avoid.

""ALIGN"" has A, forbidden.

""FLINT"" — F L I N T, fourth N, but E? No E.

Doesn't include E.

But I must include E, since E is in the word? From feedback, E is in the word but position unknown.

Yes, E is in the word, so I should include E in my guess unless I have a reason not to.

Guessing without E might not give info about E, but I need to know where E is.

So better to include E.

Unless I think E position can be inferred later, but with only 6 guesses, including E is better.

So, for next guess, include E not in position 5, and N in position 4.

Now, let's choose between:

Option 1: ""SPEND"" - letters S, P, E, N, D. Positions: S1, P2, E3, N4, D5

E in position 3.

Option 2: ""BEING"" - B1, E2, I3, N4, G5. E in position 2.

Option 3: ""EBONY"" - E1, B2, O3, N4, Y5. E in position 1.

Also, ""STEND"" not a word.

""SPINE"" has E in fifth, no.

Which one gives more information?

""SPEND"" has S and P, common.

Similarly, ""BEING"" has I and G.

Perhaps S is more common than B or others.

Common consonants: S, T, P, H, etc.

""SPEND"" seems better: S and P can test frequent letters.

Similarly, D ending is possible.

In position 5, since E is not there, it could be anything, like D, T, etc.

So I think ""SPEND"" is a good choice.

I could use a word that has T or L or something.

Another word: ""STEND"" not real. ""STAND"" but N not in fourth; ""STAND"" S-T-A-N-D, fourth N? Positions:1-S,2-T,3-A,4-N,5-D. Has A, but A is absent, so cannot use.

""SPINY"" no E.

I think ""SPEND"" is fine.

Make guess as ""spend"".

So, guess: spend

But in the feedback notation, it will be for each letter.

After this, I'll get feedback.

So, let's go with ""spend"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- N is correct and in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C, R, and A are absent from the word.

For the second guess:
- Must have N in position 4.
- Must include E but not in position 5 (so E should be in positions 1, 2, or 3).
- Avoid C, R, A completely.
- Use other common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, P, D).

A suitable word is ""spend"":
- Positions: S (1), P (2), E (3), N (4), D (5).
- This places E in position 3 (testing a new position for E) and includes common letters S, P, and D.
- It avoids C, R, and A.

This guess should help narrow down the position of E and reveal whether S, P, or D are in the secret word.

<guess>spend</guess>",spend,"Now, I have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" gave C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-). This means:

- N is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 4, since N is the fourth letter in ""crane"").

But ""BLEND"" has E in third. And we can use it, but does it avoid C,R,A? Yes, B,L,E,N,D.

- ""SPEND"": S P E N D → E in third, N fourth.

- ""SPINE"": S P I N E → I in third, N fourth, E fifth? But E is fifth, and our feedback said E is misplaced and not in fifth position, so E cannot be in fifth.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

So, words with fourth letter N: like ? ? ? N ?

With E in position 1: examples? ""ELFIN"" — E L F I N, positions: 1-E, 2-L, 3-F, 4-I, 5-N? Fourth is I, not N.

""SPENT"": S P E N T, E in third.

""BEGIN"" has G and I, positions: B,E,G,I,N — position 1-B, 2-E, 3-G, 4-I, 5-N — not N in fourth.

What about ""BEING"": B,E,I,N,G — positions:1-B,2-E,3-I,4-N,5-G? Fourth is N? N is fourth letter.

""BEING"": 1-B, 2-E, 3-I, 4-N, 5-G. Yes, N in fourth position.

And E in second position.

Similarly, ""DEIGN"": D,E,I,G,N but fourth is G? Positions:1-D,2-E,3-I,4-G,5-N — no.

So possible words:

- ""SPEND"": L1=S, L2=P, L3=E, L4=N, L5=D
- ""EVENT"": L1=E, L2=V, L3=E, L4=N, L5=T — has E twice, but secret might not have multiple E.
- ""EBONY"": L1=E, L2=B, L3=O, L4=N, L5=Y
- ""BEING"": L1=B, L2=E, L3=I, L4=N, L5=G

Now, E is misplaced in the secret word. From feedback, since N is fixed in position 4, and E is not position 5, so E must be in 1,2 or 3.

With these words, I can test E in different positions.

For example:

- If I guess ""BLEND"", E in position 3.
- If I guess ""BEING"", E in position 2.

Also, I need to consider that C,R,A are absent, so avoid them.

Moreover, I can include other common letters to get more info.

Since E is misplaced, I might want to know where it is, so guessing words with E in various positions could help, but I have to guess one word.

Also, note that the secret word has E somewhere, and N in 4th.

Letters not in word: C, R, A are confirmed absent.

Possible letters to use: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

Common ones: S, T, L, O, I.

Perhaps I should prioritize words that have many of these common letters.

List:

- ""SPEND"": uses S,P,E,N,D — S and P are good.
- ""STONE"": S T O N E, but E in fifth? Position:1-S,2-T,3-O,4-N,5-E — but E in fifth, which we know is not correct since E cannot be in position 5 in secret. So if I guess this, position 5 E would be wrong, but it might test other letters. But it's inefficient because we know E is not in 5th. Better to guess a word with E not in 5th.

Similarly, ""SHONE"" has same issue.

""SPINE"": S P I N E, E in fifth — bad.

So avoid words with E in fifth.

Back to options:

- ""SPEND"": S P E N D — E in position 3, N in 4.
- ""BLEND"": B L E N D — E in 3.
- ""BEING"": B E I N G — E in position 2, N in 4.
- ""DEITY"" — not N in fourth.
- ""MEANY"" has A.

Another one: ""OPINE"" — O P I N E, E in fifth — no.

""LINEN"" — L I N E N, has N twice? Position:1-L,2-I,3-N,4-E,5-N — N in third and fifth, E in fourth. But our feedback has N correct only in position 4, so secret might have only one N or multiple, but position 4 is N for sure.

In ""LINEN"", position 4 is E, not N, so not.

""SKULK"" no E.

I think ""SPEND"" is a good candidate: uses S, P common letters.

Similarly, ""BLEND"" or ""BEING"".

But ""BEING"" has E in position 2, which I haven't tested.

Perhaps I should choose a word that doesn't put E in the same position as before to vary, but ""crane"" had E in position 5, now position 5 won't be E.

In new guess, E should be in 1,2, or 3.

To distinguish, I can choose one with E in 2 or 1.

For example, ""BEING"": E in position 2.

Or ""EBONY"": E in position 1.

""EBONY"" needs checking: E,B,O,N,Y.

O and Y are less common maybe.

S,T,L are more common.

""STENT"" — S T E N T, position 4 is N? Positions:1-S,2-T,3-E,4-N,5-T. E in third, N in fourth.

This uses S, T, E, N, T — T twice, but possible.

Similarly, ""SPENT"": S,P,E,N,T — similar to SPEND but T instead of D.

SPEND or SPENT.

""SPEND"" is valid word, yes.

But ""SPENT"" also valid.

Let me consider the letters.

Since E is misplaced, and I need to find its position, placing it in a different spot might help.

In previous, I don't know the position, so in this guess, let me put E in position 2, for example.

Word: ""BEING"" - letters B,E,I,N,G.

Not very common letters, but valid.

Another idea: ""BEGIN"" has G and I, positions as before.

""METRO"" but no N.

Need N in fourth.

Perhaps ""SLEET"" has E multiple, but fourth letter E? no.

I think ""BEING"" or ""SPEND"" are fine.

Another common word: ""THINE"" — T H I N E, E in fifth — avoid.

""ALIGN"" has A, forbidden.

""FLINT"" — F L I N T, fourth N, but E? No E.

Doesn't include E.

But I must include E, since E is in the word? From feedback, E is in the word but position unknown.

Yes, E is in the word, so I should include E in my guess unless I have a reason not to.

Guessing without E might not give info about E, but I need to know where E is.

So better to include E.

Unless I think E position can be inferred later, but with only 6 guesses, including E is better.

So, for next guess, include E not in position 5, and N in position 4.

Now, let's choose between:

Option 1: ""SPEND"" - letters S, P, E, N, D. Positions: S1, P2, E3, N4, D5

E in position 3.

Option 2: ""BEING"" - B1, E2, I3, N4, G5. E in position 2.

Option 3: ""EBONY"" - E1, B2, O3, N4, Y5. E in position 1.

Also, ""STEND"" not a word.

""SPINE"" has E in fifth, no.

Which one gives more information?

""SPEND"" has S and P, common.

Similarly, ""BEING"" has I and G.

Perhaps S is more common than B or others.

Common consonants: S, T, P, H, etc.

""SPEND"" seems better: S and P can test frequent letters.

Similarly, D ending is possible.

In position 5, since E is not there, it could be anything, like D, T, etc.

So I think ""SPEND"" is a good choice.

I could use a word that has T or L or something.

Another word: ""STEND"" not real. ""STAND"" but N not in fourth; ""STAND"" S-T-A-N-D, fourth N? Positions:1-S,2-T,3-A,4-N,5-D. Has A, but A is absent, so cannot use.

""SPINY"" no E.

I think ""SPEND"" is fine.

Make guess as ""spend"".

So, guess: spend

But in the feedback notation, it will be for each letter.

After this, I'll get feedback.

So, let's go with ""spend"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- N is correct and in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C, R, and A are absent from the word.

For the second guess:
- Must have N in position 4.
- Must include E but not in position 5 (so E should be in positions 1, 2, or 3).
- Avoid C, R, A completely.
- Use other common letters to maximize information (e.g., S, T, P, D).

A suitable word is ""spend"":
- Positions: S (1), P (2), E (3), N (4), D (5).
- This places E in position 3 (testing a new position for E) and includes common letters S, P, and D.
- It avoids C, R, and A.

This guess should help narrow down the position of E and reveal whether S, P, or D are in the secret word.",Guess 2: spend -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) E(✓) N(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
