We are starting the game. Since we have no prior information, we want a starting word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L, etc.).
 One popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"", but let me think also about maximizing information.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. are good. But note we are allowed 6 tries.

 Considering the feedback for the first guess is crucial because it sets the stage.

 I will choose ""SLATE"". Why?
 - It has two of the most common vowels: A and E.
 - It uses common consonants: S, L, T.

 But note: we are not told any constraints and must produce a valid English word.

 Let me confirm ""SLATE"" is a word: yes, it means a thin piece of rock or a list of candidates.

 However, let me think about another popular one: ""RAISE"" is also good because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 However, in the instructions, the example used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We are free to choose.

 But note: the feedback symbols:
   ✓ : correct letter and correct position
   - : letter in word but wrong position
   x : letter not in word

 We want to maximize the information we get on the first try. That is, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 According to some analyses, the letters that appear most frequently in English 5-letter words are (in order): E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, ... 

 So words like ""LATER"" or ""ALTER"" are good? But let's see:

 I think ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because it uses three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S) that are very common.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word? Actually, ROATE is a valid word meaning an amount of revenue collected. But it is obscure.

 Another candidate is ""CRANE"". It uses C, R, A, N, E. That's also good.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: SLATE -> S, L, A, T, E
 Option 2: RAISE -> R, A, I, S, E
 Option 3: CRANE -> C, R, A, N, E

 Which has the highest probability of containing letters in the secret word?

 Since I'm not sure, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:

 - It has three vowels: A, E and two consonants C, R, N (N is common too).
 - C and R are among the top consonants.

 Alternatively, note that the letter E is the most common vowel and the most common letter. So having E at the end is good.

 Decision: I'll start with ""CRANE"".

 But wait: in the example, the secret word was ""BRISK"". If I guessed ""CRANE"":
   C is in ""BRISK""? No -> then x
   R is in ""BRISK""? Yes -> but in position 2? In BRISK, R is at position 2, so that would be ✓? But wait, the secret word is BRISK and CRANE: 
        C vs B -> not same -> so C: x
        R vs R -> same -> R: ✓
        A vs I -> different -> A: is A in BRISK? No -> x
        N vs S -> different -> N: not in BRISK -> x
        E vs K -> different -> E: not in BRISK -> x
   So we get R in the correct position and the rest x.

 That gives us one letter and position, but we don't get information on other letters being present.

 Alternatively, if I choose a word with letters that are more common? Let's try ""SLATE"" on BRISK:

   S: BRISK has S? Yes -> position? S is at position 1? Guess has S at position 1? Secret word: position 4 is S (if we count 1-indexed: B=1, R=2, I=3, S=4, K=5). So guess letter in position1: S -> secret position4: S -> so this is wrong position -> then '-' 
   L: in BRISK? -> No -> x
   A: No -> x
   T: No -> x
   E: No -> x

 Then we get one '-' and four x's. So we know S is present but in the wrong position.

 So which gives more information? In both cases we got one valuable piece. But with ""CRANE"", we know R is in position2 and that's fixed. With ""SLATE"" we know S is present but not in position1 -> then it must be in positions 2,3,4, or5.

 But note: we can get more than one letter? That depends on the secret word.

 Another candidate: ""ROAST"" -> let's try on BRISK:
   R: position1 vs position2 of secret -> not same -> but present -> '-'
   O: not present -> x
   A: not present -> x
   S: BRISK has S at position4 -> guess has S at position3? -> so no -> present -> '-'
   T: not present -> x

 Then we get two '-' and three x. We know R and S are present but not in position1 and position3 respectively.

 How about ""RAISE"" on BRISK?
   R: present -> compare position? position1 of guess vs secret: R at position1? secret has R at position2 -> so wrong -> '-'
   A: not present -> x
   I: BRISK has I at position3 -> guess has at position2? -> so wrong -> '-'
   S: present -> at position4? guess has at position4? -> no, at position3? guess position3: I -> then S is at position4? In guess, S is at position4? But secret has S at position4? 
        Actually: 
        Guess: R (1), A(2), I(3), S(4), E(5)
        Secret: B(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), K(5)
        So:
          R: wrong position -> '-'
          A: x
          I: position matches? guess position3 and secret position3 -> same -> ✓
          S: position4? also same -> ✓
          E: x
        So the feedback would be: R(-), A(x), I(✓), S(✓), E(x)

 Then we get two ✓ and one '-'. That's great.

 Therefore, ""RAISE"" seems to have the potential for more hits? But note that we are showing an example where it works well for BRISK.

 However, we don't know the secret word. Therefore, we need a word that gives maximum information in the average case.

 According to some sources, the starting words that are optimal include CRANE, SALET, ROATE, SOARE, etc.

 However, I remember that ""RAISE"" is one of the top starting words because it uses R, A, I, S, E which are among the top 10 most common letters.

 So I will go with ""RAISE"".

 Let me double-check: 
   R is the 3rd most common letter (in the top list I recalled: E, A, R, ...) -> so R is very common.
   A is the 2nd most common.
   I is a common vowel -> 7th?
   S is 8th?
   E -> the most common.

 So it's a good mix.

 Therefore, my first guess will be ""RAISE"".
</think>
I need to make an effective first guess for this Wordle-style game. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I gain from the feedback. This means prioritizing common letters in English 5-letter words.

After analyzing letter frequency:
- Vowels like A, E, I, O are common
- Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are frequent
- Ideally, the word should include several high-frequency letters

Words like ""RAISE"" work well because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- Uses 5 distinct letters to maximize coverage
- R, A, I, S, E are all top-10 frequent letters in English  

Alternative starters like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also strong, but ""RAISE"" has slight advantages:
- Higher vowel density helps test frequent letter categories
- Ending in E exploits a common word-ending pattern
- Balanced letter distribution improves feedback clarity

This guess will efficiently reveal:
- Which letters in {R, A, I, S, E} exist in the secret word
- Which positions might be partially correct  
- Vowel/consonant relationships to guide subsequent guesses

Since we have no prior information, we want a starting word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L, etc.).\n One popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"", but let me think also about maximizing information.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. are good. But note we are allowed 6 tries.\n\n Considering the feedback for the first guess is crucial because it sets the stage.\n\n I will choose ""SLATE"". Why?\n - It has two of the most common vowels: A and E.\n - It uses common consonants: S, L, T.\n\n But note: we are not told any constraints and must produce a valid English word.\n\n Let me confirm ""SLATE"" is a word: yes, it means a thin piece of rock or a list of candidates.\n\n However, let me think about another popular one: ""RAISE"" is also good because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n\n However, in the instructions, the example used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We are free to choose.\n\n But note: the feedback symbols:\n   ✓ : correct letter and correct position\n   - : letter in word but wrong position\n   x : letter not in word\n\n We want to maximize the information we get on the first try. That is, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n According to some analyses, the letters that appear most frequently in English 5-letter words are (in order): E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, ... \n\n So words like ""LATER"" or ""ALTER"" are good? But let\'s see:\n\n I think ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because it uses three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S) that are very common.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word? Actually, ROATE is a valid word meaning an amount of revenue collected. But it is obscure.\n\n Another candidate is ""CRANE"". It uses C, R, A, N, E. That\'s also good.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: SLATE -> S, L, A, T, E\n Option 2: RAISE -> R, A, I, S, E\n Option 3: CRANE -> C, R, A, N, E\n\n Which has the highest probability of containing letters in the secret word?\n\n Since I\'m not sure, I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because:\n\n - It has three vowels: A, E and two consonants C, R, N (N is common too).\n - C and R are among the top consonants.\n\n Alternatively, note that the letter E is the most common vowel and the most common letter. So having E at the end is good.\n\n Decision: I\'ll start with ""CRANE"".\n\n But wait: in the example, the secret word was ""BRISK"". If I guessed ""CRANE"":\n   C is in ""BRISK""? No -> then x\n   R is in ""BRISK""? Yes -> but in position 2? In BRISK, R is at position 2, so that would be ✓? But wait, the secret word is BRISK and CRANE: \n        C vs B -> not same -> so C: x\n        R vs R -> same -> R: ✓\n        A vs I -> different -> A: is A in BRISK? No -> x\n        N vs S -> different -> N: not in BRISK -> x\n        E vs K -> different -> E: not in BRISK -> x\n   So we get R in the correct position and the rest x.\n\n That gives us one letter and position, but we don\'t get information on other letters being present.\n\n Alternatively, if I choose a word with letters that are more common? Let\'s try ""SLATE"" on BRISK:\n\n   S: BRISK has S? Yes -> position? S is at position 1? Guess has S at position 1? Secret word: position 4 is S (if we count 1-indexed: B=1, R=2, I=3, S=4, K=5). So guess letter in position1: S -> secret position4: S -> so this is wrong position -> then \'-\' \n   L: in BRISK? -> No -> x\n   A: No -> x\n   T: No -> x\n   E: No -> x\n\n Then we get one \'-\' and four x\'s. So we know S is present but in the wrong position.\n\n So which gives more information? In both cases we got one valuable piece. But with ""CRANE"", we know R is in position2 and that\'s fixed. With ""SLATE"" we know S is present but not in position1 -> then it must be in positions 2,3,4, or5.\n\n But note: we can get more than one letter? That depends on the secret word.\n\n Another candidate: ""ROAST"" -> let\'s try on BRISK:\n   R: position1 vs position2 of secret -> not same -> but present -> \'-\'\n   O: not present -> x\n   A: not present -> x\n   S: BRISK has S at position4 -> guess has S at position3? -> so no -> present -> \'-\'\n   T: not present -> x\n\n Then we get two \'-\' and three x. We know R and S are present but not in position1 and position3 respectively.\n\n How about ""RAISE"" on BRISK?\n   R: present -> compare position? position1 of guess vs secret: R at position1? secret has R at position2 -> so wrong -> \'-\'\n   A: not present -> x\n   I: BRISK has I at position3 -> guess has at position2? -> so wrong -> \'-\'\n   S: present -> at position4? guess has at position4? -> no, at position3? guess position3: I -> then S is at position4? In guess, S is at position4? But secret has S at position4? \n        Actually: \n        Guess: R (1), A(2), I(3), S(4), E(5)\n        Secret: B(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), K(5)\n        So:\n          R: wrong position -> \'-\'\n          A: x\n          I: position matches? guess position3 and secret position3 -> same -> ✓\n          S: position4? also same -> ✓\n          E: x\n        So the feedback would be: R(-), A(x), I(✓), S(✓), E(x)\n\n Then we get two ✓ and one \'-\'. That\'s great.\n\n Therefore, ""RAISE"" seems to have the potential for more hits? But note that we are showing an example where it works well for BRISK.\n\n However, we don\'t know the secret word. Therefore, we need a word that gives maximum information in the average case.\n\n According to some sources, the starting words that are optimal include CRANE, SALET, ROATE, SOARE, etc.\n\n However, I remember that ""RAISE"" is one of the top starting words because it uses R, A, I, S, E which are among the top 10 most common letters.\n\n So I will go with ""RAISE"".\n\n Let me double-check: \n   R is the 3rd most common letter (in the top list I recalled: E, A, R, ...) -> so R is very common.\n   A is the 2nd most common.\n   I is a common vowel -> 7th?\n   S is 8th?\n   E -> the most common.\n\n So it\'s a good mix.\n\n Therefore, my first guess will be ""RAISE"".I need to make an effective first guess for this Wordle-style game. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I gain from the feedback. This means prioritizing common letters in English 5-letter words.\n\nAfter analyzing letter frequency:\n- Vowels like A, E, I, O are common\n- Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are frequent\n- Ideally, the word should include several high-frequency letters\n\nWords like ""RAISE"" work well because:\n- It contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)\n- Uses 5 distinct letters to maximize coverage\n- R, A, I, S, E are all top-10 frequent letters in English  \n\nAlternative starters like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also strong, but ""RAISE"" has slight advantages:\n- Higher vowel density helps test frequent letter categories\n- Ending in E exploits a common word-ending pattern\n- Balanced letter distribution improves feedback clarity\n\nThis guess will efficiently reveal:\n- Which letters in {R, A, I, S, E} exist in the secret word\n- Which positions might be partially correct  \n- Vowel/consonant relationships to guide subsequent guesses\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback on our first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x -> not present in the word
  A: - -> present but in the wrong position
  I: x -> not present
  S: ✓ -> correct position (so S must be the fourth letter of the secret word)
  E: x -> not present

So what we know:
- The secret word has the letter **A**, but not in the second position (where we had A in RAISE). However, it could be in any position except 2? Actually, the feedback only says it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in positions 1, 3, 5? Remember that positions are fixed: 
    Position1: R -> not in word
    Position2: A -> in word but not here
    Position3: I -> not in word
    Position4: S -> correct and in position
    Position5: E -> not in word

- Therefore, the secret word has:
  - S at the fourth position? Wait: the fourth letter is S. Since we wrote RAISE: 
      R (pos1), A (pos2), I (pos3), S (pos4), E (pos5)
  So the fourth letter of the secret word is S.

- The letter A must appear somewhere else: so positions 1, 3, or 5? But note: position5 is not available because we also know E is not present and also note:
  We know that position1 cannot be A? Actually, we cannot be certain until we test. But we know A is not in position2. 

However, we also know:
- R is not in the word at all? So any position? So we must avoid R in the rest of the word.
- Similarly, I and E are absent.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains the letter A (but not at position 2) and S (at position 4)
- Does not contain R, I, E.

Since we have S fixed at position4, we can now make a new guess.

We must also consider:
- The word must have 5 letters, and we know two: the fourth is S, and A is present somewhere else (positions 1,3,5?).

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, or 5? But position5 is last, which is common for vowels? But wait, A can be at the beginning or middle.

Moreover, we have to pick a word that excludes R, I, E.

Common English words with S in the fourth position and containing A.

Looking for patterns: we can represent the word as: _ _ _ S _

And A must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5? But note: also the second position is already excluded? And we may consider that A could be in the fifth? But we don't know.

But also remember: we have not set the rest of the letters. So we need to guess a word that:
1. Has the fourth letter S.
2. Contains the letter A (but not as the second letter? But actually the feedback said A is in the wrong position, meaning specifically that it is not in position2? But in the new word, we can put A anywhere except that we know it's not in position2? Actually, we are guessing another word so we can put A wherever we want? But the feedback tells us that in the secret word, A is in a different position than the second.

But importantly, we should avoid using R, I, E anywhere.

Now, we can choose a word that has A in either position1, 3, or 5? And also we know the fourth is S.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information. In particular, common consonants and vowels.

What letters can we use? We can try to include other common letters that are not excluded: so avoid R, I, E. Common letters: O, T, L, N, etc.

Idea: try to put A in position1? Or position3? Or position5? Probably we should test a few possibilities? And also include new letters.

Let me think of words with S in the fourth position? For example:
- The word ends with S? But here is in the fourth position? So the fifth letter can be something else.

Pattern: __ __ __ S __

So the last letter is the fifth.

Words ending with ""S_"" are not common? Actually, no: the word has five letters? So the fifth is one character.

Examples of words that have S in the fourth position? 
  GLASS -> G L A S S? Wait: this has five letters: positions? 
      G1, L2, A3, S4, S5? But that's five letters. Then S is the fourth letter? Yes.

But in GLASS: 
  Letters: G, L, A, S, S? Then S is the fourth letter? And then the fifth letter is also S? So two S's? But our feedback didn't say anything about duplicate letters? So it's possible.

But we know that A is present: in GLASS, A is at position3.

But note: we have feedback that A is not at position2? Which is true? But wait, the word could have duplicate letters? But our first guess RAISE didn't have duplicates? So maybe duplicates are allowed?

Now let's see the feedback: we had RAISE -> A was marked as '-' meaning present: so the secret word must have at least one A. In GLASS, it has A? Yes. But also note: GLASS has two S: but we have S at position4 being ✓, so if we guess GLASS and the secret word has an S at position4? Then at position5? Let me check.

Actually, our feedback indicated that only S was fixed? So we need to see how the game handles duplicates? The rules don't clarify? But typically:

Assume standard Wordle rules: if there is one S in the secret word but two S in the guess, then one might get marked as green and the other as yellow? Or if the secret word has two, then both might get yellow/green accordingly.

But in our case, we have S at position4: ✓. And then if there's another S? Then we don't know until we see.

But since we don't have information about duplicate S? We are not forbidden? But also note: we didn't see an extra S? Because in RAISE, we only had one S? So if the secret word had an extra S? Then our RAISE wouldn't have shown in feedback? Actually, the feedback would only show what exists.

For example, if the secret word is GLASS? Then it has S at position4 and also position5. Then for RAISE:

  RAISE: 
    R -> not in GLASS? So x (correct)
    A -> in GLASS? At position3 -> so present: wait, we would get marked by '-'? And it was: A is '-'? Because it's present? But not at position2? So feedback: R(x) A(-) ... 
    I -> not present: so x? Correct.
    S -> at position4: RAISE has S at position4? Secret word has S at position4? So ✓? Correct. 
    E -> not present? In GLASS? So E: x? Correct.

But note: in GLASS, it has an extra S? But our RAISE has only one S? Then the feedback wouldn't mark the fifth S? So we don't know? Therefore, we might need to consider duplicate letters.

But for this guess, we can pick a word that doesn't have duplicates? Or do we? Actually not necessary.

I'll try to pick a word with S at position4? And containing A? And avoiding R, I, E? And also we want to test other common letters? Like O, T, L, N, etc.

Possible words:

Let me consider: 
  A: at position1? words like: A _ _ S _ 
      Examples: ANSWERS? More than 5 letters? 
      5-letter words: ANTSY? ANTSY: A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5? So S is at position4? Good. Also: ANTSY has A at 1? And contains T, N, Y? And avoids R, I, E? Then let's consider:

But note: in ANTSY, the A is at position1? This would be a good candidate? Then we can check:
  If the secret word has A at position1? Then we would expect a ✓? Or if it is elsewhere? 
  Also, we can test N, T, S? Note S is already at position4? So it's known? 

Alternatively: put A at position5: then pattern: _ _ _ S A? Words? Like? 
  CONGA? CONGA: C1 O2 N3 G4 A5? Wait: position4 is G? We need position4 to be S? So that doesn't work.

Or words with A in the middle: position3? Pattern: _ _ A S _ 
  Words: CLASS? CLASS: C1 L2 A3 S4 S5? But has two S? So CLASS? 
      CLASS has S at position4? And A at position3? And letters C, L, S? Also avoids R, I, E? Then yes.

But wait: CLASS has two S? Then if the secret word has only one S? That might cause feedback issue? But let's see: if the secret word has exactly one S at position4, then in CLASS guess:
  C: ? 
  L: ?
  A: ✓? If A is at position3? 
  First S: position4? ✓
  Second S: position5? then should be marked as 'x'? Because there is no second S? 

Actually, the feedback rules: 
  If the secret word has a letter only once, and you guess two, then the first occurrence of the letter (in the guess) that can be matched will get a ✓ or -, and the redundant one will be marked as x? Typically? 

But the rules says: 
  ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols""

And the symbols are assigned independently? But actually, the standard Wordle method is: 

  First check for exact matches? Then mark those letters? Then check the remaining for misplaced.

Therefore: 
  Consider secret word: GLASS? 
    Guess: CLASS? 
      Positions: 
        Position4: S? Secret has S at position4? → S4 ✓? 
        Then for the fifth S? The secret has another S? So that S is also present? But then we have to mark it? But wait, the secret has two S? And the guess has two S? And the first one at position4 is already matched? So the fifth position: S? matches? But wait: the secret has S at position4 and also at position5? So the guess fifth S? Then it would be matched? So ✓? 

  Alternatively: secret word was something else? Only one S? Then CLASS:
        Position4: S (secret has S at position4) → ✓
        Position5: S (secret has only one S? Then already matched? Therefore, no S left → x? 

But since we haven't seen the secret word? Let me not overcomplicate.

But note: we know from the feedback that A is present? But we don't know if it appears once or more? Similarly, the secret word may have duplicate letters? So we have to be careful.

Given that, I will try to find words that avoid duplicate letters? To make feedback cleaner? Or accept that duplicates are possible.

But in our next guess, we can avoid using duplicate letters? Because we want maximum information? 

So let me avoid duplicates? So the word has exactly five distinct letters? But we have to? Not required? But for guessing, using distinct letters can help get information for other letters? 

Now: our constraints:
  Position4: must be S? 
  The word must contain A? (exactly one? we don't know? but at least one) and avoid R, I, E? 
  We can test other letters? 

Example words:
  ANTSY? I think ANTSY is a valid word? (antsy: nervous)

ANTSY: 
  Positions:
    1: A? Then we test A: which could be ✓ if the secret word has A at start? Or '-' if elsewhere? Or if duplicate? 
  We also test N, T, S? But S is at position4? fixed? 
  Letters: A, N, T, S, Y? Distinct? and avoid R,I,E? 

Also consider words like:
  CAMPS? CAMPS: C1, A2, M3, P4, S5? Oh wait: position4 is P? But we need position4 to be S? 

Also: GASSY? G1 A2 S3 S4 Y5? Has duplicate S? So position4 is S? Good? But then A is at position2? But we cannot put A at position2? Because in our first guess, A was at position2? And it's marked as '-' meaning not here? But wait: that was for the word RAISE? Now we are guessing GASSY? 

Important: the feedback on the first guess told us that A is not in position2? So in the secret word, A is in a position other than 2? 

Therefore, in our next guess? We must not put A at position2? Because we know it's not!? Exactly? 

So if we put A at position2 in our guess? Then what? 
  In GASSY: A at position2? Then the secret word? If the secret word has A at position2? Why was it marked as '-'? That is confusing? 

We must be careful: the first guess's feedback: A was marked as '-' meaning that the letter A exists in the word? But not in position2? So we know that in the secret word, position2 is NOT A? 

Therefore, if we put A at position2 in a new guess? Then we will definitely get a '-' (if the secret word actually has A?)?

But wait: if the secret word has A at position2? Then it would have been ✓? But it wasn't? So we know position2 is not A? So for GASSY? We are putting A at position2? Then the feedback would be: '-'? But we already know it's not at position2? So we don't gain new information? Worse, we are wasting a slot? So we should avoid putting A at position2? 

Moreover, we know it's not at position2? So any guess should place A elsewhere.

Therefore, in GASSY? it's invalid? Because we are putting A at position2? Then the feedback will say: yes, A is in the word? But not at position2? But we already know? So what's the point? We should put A somewhere else? Maybe to test another position? 

Actually, we can put A at position2? to test? But no? because we know it's not? So we are sure? So putting A at position2? Then we will get a '-'? But we know? So no new information? 

So we should avoid? 

Therefore, avoid using A at position2? in any guess? 

So let me find words with:
  Pattern: _ _ _ S ? 
  Must include A? but not at position2? 
  Avoid R, I, E? 
  And using other common letters? 

Options:
  Position1: A? Then words like: A _ _ S _ ? 
      Example: ANTSY? 
      Also: ABYSS? has a lot of S? so duplicate? 
             ABYSS: A1,B2,Y3,S4,S5? Duplicate S? 
  Position3: A? Then words: _ _ A S ? 
      Example: CHASM? CHASM: C1 H2 A3 S4 M5? 
      Also: CLASP? but more than 5? 

  Position5: A? Then words: _ _ _ S A? 
      Examples: MANSA? but obscure? 
      Words: There are words? LAMPS? but position4: P? 
         How about PATHS? PATHS: P1 A2 T3 H4 S5? Now S is at position5? We need position4? 
         Not working? 
         Words ending with SA? Like MANSA? Or VISTA? VISTA: V1 I2 S3 T4 A5? Then S at position3? 

Conclusion: 
  Positions for A: 1 or 3? Because we cannot use position2? and position5 might be difficult? 

Let me consider: 
  ANTSY: A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5? 
      This contains A at start? So test position1? Also N at position2? T at position3? Avoids R,I,E? 

But wait: we also know that position2? In ANTSY: we are using N at position2? What if the secret word has A at position2? No? We know it doesn't? So no conflict? But we are using N? which is new? 

Also: CHASM? C1, H2, A3, S4, M5? 
      Then A at position3? We are testing? 

Which word is better? 

We also need to cover more letters? So ANTSY: tests A, N, T, Y? 
CHASM: tests C, H, A, M? 

Both are valid words? 

Now: common letters? 
  N and T are more common than C, H, M? So ANTSY might cover more common letters? 

Let me see the frequencies:

  Letter frequencies (from high to low): 
    E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, Y, F, V, K, W, Z, X, J, Q

So A: high? Now we are testing A? But we know A exists? so we don't need to confirm existence? Instead, we want to pin down the position? 

But also we test other letters? 

For ANTSY: 
  Letters: A (already known? but we want to test its position?), N, T, S (known? already ✓ at position4? so only position4 must be S? In our guess we set S at position4? which should always be? so it will be ✓ again? 

Therefore, guess ANTSY: 
  Positions:
    1: A? → if the secret word has A at position1? then ✓? otherwise, if elsewhere? then '-'? 
    2: N? → new letter? 
    3: T? → new letter? 
    4: S? → we already know? ✓? 
    5: Y? → new letter? 

Similarly for CHASM: 
  1: C → if present? 
  2: H → ? 
  3: A? → if secret word has A at position3? then ✓? 
  4: S? → ✓? 
  5: M → new? 

Between ANTSY and CHASM? The commonality: 
  ANTSY tests A at 1? and N, T, Y? 
  CHASM tests A at 3? and C, H, M? 

Which is better? 

We know that A is in the word? But we don't know the position? So we can test position1? if we get ✓? Then we know!? If not? Then it must be position3? or 5? But wait, are there other positions? We excluded position2? and we haven't tested position5? but we said position5 words are hard? 

In our constraints? Pattern: _ _ _ S _? So the first three letters? or fifth? 

Also, we might have words where A is at position5? But we need S in the fourth? 

Let me find: are there words with A at position5? and S at position4? 
  Words ending with SA? Actually, most English words with S at fourth? Then fifth? Not necessarily? 

Examples: 
  QUASI? QUASI: Q1 U2 A3 S4 I5? But I5? We cannot use I? Because we know I is not present? So invalid? 
  Also: TANSY? TANSY: T1 A2 N3 S4 Y5? Wait: A at position2? But we cannot use A at position2? So invalid? 
  MANAS? MANAS: M1 A2 N3 A4 S5? A2? invalid? 

How about words like: VASAL? VASAL: V1 A2 S3 A4 L5? A2? invalid? 

So I think: position5? There are words? LAMSA? Not a word? 

So we are left with position1 or position3 for A? 

Now: should we guess A at position1? or position3? 

By guessing A at position1? we can test it? And if it's ✓? Then we know? And if not? Then we know it must be position3 or higher? Later? 

Similarly? By guessing A at position3? we can test? 

But note: if we guess A at position1? and we get ✓? Then we know the first letter? And also S at the fourth? Then we can ignore position3? But wait: position3? We don't know? 

But also? if we get A at position1 ✓? Then we have two letters? and we know the rest must be letters not R,I,E? 

Alternatively? if we guess CHASM? A at position3? and it turns out A is actually at position3? Then we know first letter? Also?

But if we guess A at position1? and A is actually at position3? Then it will be marked as '-'? Meaning present? but not here? Which we already know? So no new information? Except that it is not at position1? Then we know it must be position3? 

So: 

  Option1: guess ANTSY?
    If A is at position1? then we get ✓ for A? and then we know: word begins with A? and then _ , _ , S? and the fifth letter? Also? 
    If not? Then A gets '-'? and then we know A must be at position3? Because we've avoided position2? and we can't have it at position4? which is S? 

But wait: the secret word: 
  position4 is S? 
  The letter A? cannot be at position2? and if it's at position4? Then A=S? That can't be? So A must be either position1 or position3 or position5? But we couldn't find words for position5? Which leaves? position1 and 3? 

Therefore, if we guess ANTSY? 
  Possible outcomes:
    If A is at position1? then ✓? 
    If A is at position3? then at our guess position1? A → we get '-'? 
    If A is at position5? which is very rare? then we get '-'? 

But we haven't tested position5 so far? 

Alternatively? Guess a word that tests two positions? But we have limited choices? Let me try to think: 

Word: PLAYS? Has S at position5? No? 

Another idea: guess a word that puts A at position5? Even if we didn't find? We can create a word? But we must use English words. 

What about the word: MASSA? Not valid? 

Word: TASSA? No? 

Word: PASSA? Not common? Let me list? 

Valid words: 
  MANAS? But not standard? and A at position2? invalid? 
  KANS? 4 letters? 
  There might be less common words? 

Another possibility: YEAHS? But E? We cannot use E? 

So probably? We cannot cover position5? Therefore? it's either 1 or 3? 

Thus? ANTSY would test position1? 

But? What about the word: CHASM? Which tests position3? 

Given this? I prefer to cover? maybe test A at position3? Why? Because position1? We can test later? But note: we are at the second guess? and we have 6 tries? 

Also? we can choose ANTSY? because it tests? more common letters? N, T, and Y? 

Alternatively? What is more efficient? 

We can choose a word that covers? two possibilities? But it's hard? 

Therefore? I suggest? guessing? ANTSY? 

But wait? let me see? ANTSY: if the secret word has A at position3? then our guess: ANTSY? 
  Position1: A? → not present? This secret word? Then we mark A: 
    If the secret word has A at position3? Then our A at position1? should get 'x'? But wait: it would be marked as '-'? because A exists in the word? 
    Even though same letter? Because A exists? but not? at position1? Then we get '-'? 

But wait: this confusion? 

Actually? standard rules: 
  For ANTSY? against a secret word? say? at the secret word? A at position3: 
    Secret: _ _ A S _
    Guess: ANTSY: 
      Position1: A? → the secret word? Does it have A at position1? No? but it has A? at position3? So this A in position1? should be marked as '-'? 
      Then position2: N? If the secret has letter at position2? We don't care? 
      Position3: T? if the secret has T? → but we don't know? 
      Position4: S? ✓? 
      Position5: Y? 

So? We get? A at position1 marked as '-'? meaning? A exists? but not at position1? 

Then we know A? must be at? position3? or 5? 

Because? we excluded position2? and position1? then? 

Similarly? if the secret word had A at position5? then we also get '-' at A (position1) of ANTSY? 

But how do we distinguish between A at position3 and A at position5? 

That's a problem? 

After ANTSY? if A at position1? marked as? then ✓? or if not? then '-'? meaning A exists? not at position1? However? then we still have ambiguity? 

To avoid that? we can choose a word that has A at position3? so we test directly position3? 

Therefore? CHASM? might be better? 

CHASM: 
  Positions: 
    1: C? new? 
    2: H? new? 
    3: A? Then feedback: 
        If the secret has A at position3? then ✓? 
        If it has A? elsewhere (position1 or 5)? Then '-'? 
    4: S? ✓? 
    5: M? new? 

But if the secret has A at position1? Then CHASM:
  Position1: C? compared to A? → not match? but secret has A at position1? which is not in our guess's letter1? But wait? our guess's letter1 is C? Then? 
        C? should be checked: not present? → x? 
        Then? A? at position3? even if? the secret has a A? at position3? But wait? it also has one at position1? Then we have:

        Secret: A? _ _ S _? and at position3? we don't know? 

        But: the secret has A? and our guess has A at position3? Then if the secret has A at position3? then it's ✓? Otherwise? '-'? 

        If the secret has A at position1 and also position3? Then we would get: 
          C: x (because not in? or if A is duplicated? then: 
          We would have A in guess at position3? matched to A at position3? then ✓? 
          And the A at position1 of secret? not matched? 

        If the secret has A only at position1? then our A at position3? is not at the correct position? but present? so '-'? 

        So the feedback would show: 
          Position1: x? 
          Position3: ✓? if A at position3? Or '-'? if A exists? but not at position3? 

But the secret cannot have both A at position1 and position3? Because we already know that A is present? we don't know about multiplicities? 

But? importantly? by not testing position1? we can miss? 

However? Given that we can only test one position at a time? 

So I propose CHASM? which tests A at position3? 

Then after the feedback? we will know:
  For A?:
    If we get ✓ at position3? then we know A? is at position3? 
    If we get '-'? Which would be at position3? then? that means A is not at position3? but present? then we know A must be at position1? or position5? 
    If we get x? Cannot? Then we know nothing? 

But wait: no? We know A exists? So in CHASM? 
  If the secret word has A at position3? then ✓? 
  If the secret word has A but not at position3? then '-'? 

Since position3 must be matched? 

Therefore? I think CHASM? is better? 

Alternatively? if we use a word that has A at position1 and also includes? a common letter at position5? But no? 

Therefore? I choose CHASM? 

So let's go with CHASM? 
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":  
- **R, I, E are eliminated** since they are marked as absent (x).  
- **S is fixed at position 4** (✓) in the secret word.  
- **A is present but not in position 2** (-), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  

Given the constraints and common English words:  
- The secret word must fit the pattern `_ _ _ S _`, containing the letter A (not in position 2).  
- Letters R, I, E are excluded.  

For this second guess:  
- **Testing position 3 for A** helps narrow down its location efficiently.  
- **CHASM (C1 H2 A3 S4 M5)** is chosen because:  
  - It tests A in position 3 (to resolve ambiguity).  
  - Includes new common letters (C, H, M) to probe the word structure.  
  - Avoids eliminated letters (R, I, E) and the forbidden position 2 for A.  
- If A is in position 3, we get direct confirmation; otherwise, the feedback (- or ✓) will clarify A's true position or reveal new letters.  

<guess>CHASM</guess>",CHASM,"We are given feedback on our first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x -> not present in the word
  A: - -> present but in the wrong position
  I: x -> not present
  S: ✓ -> correct position (so S must be the fourth letter of the secret word)
  E: x -> not present

So what we know:
- The secret word has the letter **A**, but not in the second position (where we had A in RAISE). However, it could be in any position except 2? Actually, the feedback only says it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in positions 1, 3, 5? Remember that positions are fixed: 
    Position1: R -> not in word
    Position2: A -> in word but not here
    Position3: I -> not in word
    Position4: S -> correct and in position
    Position5: E -> not in word

- Therefore, the secret word has:
  - S at the fourth position? Wait: the fourth letter is S. Since we wrote RAISE: 
      R (pos1), A (pos2), I (pos3), S (pos4), E (pos5)
  So the fourth letter of the secret word is S.

- The letter A must appear somewhere else: so positions 1, 3, or 5? But note: position5 is not available because we also know E is not present and also note:
  We know that position1 cannot be A? Actually, we cannot be certain until we test. But we know A is not in position2. 

However, we also know:
- R is not in the word at all? So any position? So we must avoid R in the rest of the word.
- Similarly, I and E are absent.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains the letter A (but not at position 2) and S (at position 4)
- Does not contain R, I, E.

Since we have S fixed at position4, we can now make a new guess.

We must also consider:
- The word must have 5 letters, and we know two: the fourth is S, and A is present somewhere else (positions 1,3,5?).

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, or 5? But position5 is last, which is common for vowels? But wait, A can be at the beginning or middle.

Moreover, we have to pick a word that excludes R, I, E.

Common English words with S in the fourth position and containing A.

Looking for patterns: we can represent the word as: _ _ _ S _

And A must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5? But note: also the second position is already excluded? And we may consider that A could be in the fifth? But we don't know.

But also remember: we have not set the rest of the letters. So we need to guess a word that:
1. Has the fourth letter S.
2. Contains the letter A (but not as the second letter? But actually the feedback said A is in the wrong position, meaning specifically that it is not in position2? But in the new word, we can put A anywhere except that we know it's not in position2? Actually, we are guessing another word so we can put A wherever we want? But the feedback tells us that in the secret word, A is in a different position than the second.

But importantly, we should avoid using R, I, E anywhere.

Now, we can choose a word that has A in either position1, 3, or 5? And also we know the fourth is S.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information. In particular, common consonants and vowels.

What letters can we use? We can try to include other common letters that are not excluded: so avoid R, I, E. Common letters: O, T, L, N, etc.

Idea: try to put A in position1? Or position3? Or position5? Probably we should test a few possibilities? And also include new letters.

Let me think of words with S in the fourth position? For example:
- The word ends with S? But here is in the fourth position? So the fifth letter can be something else.

Pattern: __ __ __ S __

So the last letter is the fifth.

Words ending with ""S_"" are not common? Actually, no: the word has five letters? So the fifth is one character.

Examples of words that have S in the fourth position? 
  GLASS -> G L A S S? Wait: this has five letters: positions? 
      G1, L2, A3, S4, S5? But that's five letters. Then S is the fourth letter? Yes.

But in GLASS: 
  Letters: G, L, A, S, S? Then S is the fourth letter? And then the fifth letter is also S? So two S's? But our feedback didn't say anything about duplicate letters? So it's possible.

But we know that A is present: in GLASS, A is at position3.

But note: we have feedback that A is not at position2? Which is true? But wait, the word could have duplicate letters? But our first guess RAISE didn't have duplicates? So maybe duplicates are allowed?

Now let's see the feedback: we had RAISE -> A was marked as '-' meaning present: so the secret word must have at least one A. In GLASS, it has A? Yes. But also note: GLASS has two S: but we have S at position4 being ✓, so if we guess GLASS and the secret word has an S at position4? Then at position5? Let me check.

Actually, our feedback indicated that only S was fixed? So we need to see how the game handles duplicates? The rules don't clarify? But typically:

Assume standard Wordle rules: if there is one S in the secret word but two S in the guess, then one might get marked as green and the other as yellow? Or if the secret word has two, then both might get yellow/green accordingly.

But in our case, we have S at position4: ✓. And then if there's another S? Then we don't know until we see.

But since we don't have information about duplicate S? We are not forbidden? But also note: we didn't see an extra S? Because in RAISE, we only had one S? So if the secret word had an extra S? Then our RAISE wouldn't have shown in feedback? Actually, the feedback would only show what exists.

For example, if the secret word is GLASS? Then it has S at position4 and also position5. Then for RAISE:

  RAISE: 
    R -> not in GLASS? So x (correct)
    A -> in GLASS? At position3 -> so present: wait, we would get marked by '-'? And it was: A is '-'? Because it's present? But not at position2? So feedback: R(x) A(-) ... 
    I -> not present: so x? Correct.
    S -> at position4: RAISE has S at position4? Secret word has S at position4? So ✓? Correct. 
    E -> not present? In GLASS? So E: x? Correct.

But note: in GLASS, it has an extra S? But our RAISE has only one S? Then the feedback wouldn't mark the fifth S? So we don't know? Therefore, we might need to consider duplicate letters.

But for this guess, we can pick a word that doesn't have duplicates? Or do we? Actually not necessary.

I'll try to pick a word with S at position4? And containing A? And avoiding R, I, E? And also we want to test other common letters? Like O, T, L, N, etc.

Possible words:

Let me consider: 
  A: at position1? words like: A _ _ S _ 
      Examples: ANSWERS? More than 5 letters? 
      5-letter words: ANTSY? ANTSY: A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5? So S is at position4? Good. Also: ANTSY has A at 1? And contains T, N, Y? And avoids R, I, E? Then let's consider:

But note: in ANTSY, the A is at position1? This would be a good candidate? Then we can check:
  If the secret word has A at position1? Then we would expect a ✓? Or if it is elsewhere? 
  Also, we can test N, T, S? Note S is already at position4? So it's known? 

Alternatively: put A at position5: then pattern: _ _ _ S A? Words? Like? 
  CONGA? CONGA: C1 O2 N3 G4 A5? Wait: position4 is G? We need position4 to be S? So that doesn't work.

Or words with A in the middle: position3? Pattern: _ _ A S _ 
  Words: CLASS? CLASS: C1 L2 A3 S4 S5? But has two S? So CLASS? 
      CLASS has S at position4? And A at position3? And letters C, L, S? Also avoids R, I, E? Then yes.

But wait: CLASS has two S? Then if the secret word has only one S? That might cause feedback issue? But let's see: if the secret word has exactly one S at position4, then in CLASS guess:
  C: ? 
  L: ?
  A: ✓? If A is at position3? 
  First S: position4? ✓
  Second S: position5? then should be marked as 'x'? Because there is no second S? 

Actually, the feedback rules: 
  If the secret word has a letter only once, and you guess two, then the first occurrence of the letter (in the guess) that can be matched will get a ✓ or -, and the redundant one will be marked as x? Typically? 

But the rules says: 
  ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols""

And the symbols are assigned independently? But actually, the standard Wordle method is: 

  First check for exact matches? Then mark those letters? Then check the remaining for misplaced.

Therefore: 
  Consider secret word: GLASS? 
    Guess: CLASS? 
      Positions: 
        Position4: S? Secret has S at position4? → S4 ✓? 
        Then for the fifth S? The secret has another S? So that S is also present? But then we have to mark it? But wait, the secret has two S? And the guess has two S? And the first one at position4 is already matched? So the fifth position: S? matches? But wait: the secret has S at position4 and also at position5? So the guess fifth S? Then it would be matched? So ✓? 

  Alternatively: secret word was something else? Only one S? Then CLASS:
        Position4: S (secret has S at position4) → ✓
        Position5: S (secret has only one S? Then already matched? Therefore, no S left → x? 

But since we haven't seen the secret word? Let me not overcomplicate.

But note: we know from the feedback that A is present? But we don't know if it appears once or more? Similarly, the secret word may have duplicate letters? So we have to be careful.

Given that, I will try to find words that avoid duplicate letters? To make feedback cleaner? Or accept that duplicates are possible.

But in our next guess, we can avoid using duplicate letters? Because we want maximum information? 

So let me avoid duplicates? So the word has exactly five distinct letters? But we have to? Not required? But for guessing, using distinct letters can help get information for other letters? 

Now: our constraints:
  Position4: must be S? 
  The word must contain A? (exactly one? we don't know? but at least one) and avoid R, I, E? 
  We can test other letters? 

Example words:
  ANTSY? I think ANTSY is a valid word? (antsy: nervous)

ANTSY: 
  Positions:
    1: A? Then we test A: which could be ✓ if the secret word has A at start? Or '-' if elsewhere? Or if duplicate? 
  We also test N, T, S? But S is at position4? fixed? 
  Letters: A, N, T, S, Y? Distinct? and avoid R,I,E? 

Also consider words like:
  CAMPS? CAMPS: C1, A2, M3, P4, S5? Oh wait: position4 is P? But we need position4 to be S? 

Also: GASSY? G1 A2 S3 S4 Y5? Has duplicate S? So position4 is S? Good? But then A is at position2? But we cannot put A at position2? Because in our first guess, A was at position2? And it's marked as '-' meaning not here? But wait: that was for the word RAISE? Now we are guessing GASSY? 

Important: the feedback on the first guess told us that A is not in position2? So in the secret word, A is in a position other than 2? 

Therefore, in our next guess? We must not put A at position2? Because we know it's not!? Exactly? 

So if we put A at position2 in our guess? Then what? 
  In GASSY: A at position2? Then the secret word? If the secret word has A at position2? Why was it marked as '-'? That is confusing? 

We must be careful: the first guess's feedback: A was marked as '-' meaning that the letter A exists in the word? But not in position2? So we know that in the secret word, position2 is NOT A? 

Therefore, if we put A at position2 in a new guess? Then we will definitely get a '-' (if the secret word actually has A?)?

But wait: if the secret word has A at position2? Then it would have been ✓? But it wasn't? So we know position2 is not A? So for GASSY? We are putting A at position2? Then the feedback would be: '-'? But we already know it's not at position2? So we don't gain new information? Worse, we are wasting a slot? So we should avoid putting A at position2? 

Moreover, we know it's not at position2? So any guess should place A elsewhere.

Therefore, in GASSY? it's invalid? Because we are putting A at position2? Then the feedback will say: yes, A is in the word? But not at position2? But we already know? So what's the point? We should put A somewhere else? Maybe to test another position? 

Actually, we can put A at position2? to test? But no? because we know it's not? So we are sure? So putting A at position2? Then we will get a '-'? But we know? So no new information? 

So we should avoid? 

Therefore, avoid using A at position2? in any guess? 

So let me find words with:
  Pattern: _ _ _ S ? 
  Must include A? but not at position2? 
  Avoid R, I, E? 
  And using other common letters? 

Options:
  Position1: A? Then words like: A _ _ S _ ? 
      Example: ANTSY? 
      Also: ABYSS? has a lot of S? so duplicate? 
             ABYSS: A1,B2,Y3,S4,S5? Duplicate S? 
  Position3: A? Then words: _ _ A S ? 
      Example: CHASM? CHASM: C1 H2 A3 S4 M5? 
      Also: CLASP? but more than 5? 

  Position5: A? Then words: _ _ _ S A? 
      Examples: MANSA? but obscure? 
      Words: There are words? LAMPS? but position4: P? 
         How about PATHS? PATHS: P1 A2 T3 H4 S5? Now S is at position5? We need position4? 
         Not working? 
         Words ending with SA? Like MANSA? Or VISTA? VISTA: V1 I2 S3 T4 A5? Then S at position3? 

Conclusion: 
  Positions for A: 1 or 3? Because we cannot use position2? and position5 might be difficult? 

Let me consider: 
  ANTSY: A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5? 
      This contains A at start? So test position1? Also N at position2? T at position3? Avoids R,I,E? 

But wait: we also know that position2? In ANTSY: we are using N at position2? What if the secret word has A at position2? No? We know it doesn't? So no conflict? But we are using N? which is new? 

Also: CHASM? C1, H2, A3, S4, M5? 
      Then A at position3? We are testing? 

Which word is better? 

We also need to cover more letters? So ANTSY: tests A, N, T, Y? 
CHASM: tests C, H, A, M? 

Both are valid words? 

Now: common letters? 
  N and T are more common than C, H, M? So ANTSY might cover more common letters? 

Let me see the frequencies:

  Letter frequencies (from high to low): 
    E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, Y, F, V, K, W, Z, X, J, Q

So A: high? Now we are testing A? But we know A exists? so we don't need to confirm existence? Instead, we want to pin down the position? 

But also we test other letters? 

For ANTSY: 
  Letters: A (already known? but we want to test its position?), N, T, S (known? already ✓ at position4? so only position4 must be S? In our guess we set S at position4? which should always be? so it will be ✓ again? 

Therefore, guess ANTSY: 
  Positions:
    1: A? → if the secret word has A at position1? then ✓? otherwise, if elsewhere? then '-'? 
    2: N? → new letter? 
    3: T? → new letter? 
    4: S? → we already know? ✓? 
    5: Y? → new letter? 

Similarly for CHASM: 
  1: C → if present? 
  2: H → ? 
  3: A? → if secret word has A at position3? then ✓? 
  4: S? → ✓? 
  5: M → new? 

Between ANTSY and CHASM? The commonality: 
  ANTSY tests A at 1? and N, T, Y? 
  CHASM tests A at 3? and C, H, M? 

Which is better? 

We know that A is in the word? But we don't know the position? So we can test position1? if we get ✓? Then we know!? If not? Then it must be position3? or 5? But wait, are there other positions? We excluded position2? and we haven't tested position5? but we said position5 words are hard? 

In our constraints? Pattern: _ _ _ S _? So the first three letters? or fifth? 

Also, we might have words where A is at position5? But we need S in the fourth? 

Let me find: are there words with A at position5? and S at position4? 
  Words ending with SA? Actually, most English words with S at fourth? Then fifth? Not necessarily? 

Examples: 
  QUASI? QUASI: Q1 U2 A3 S4 I5? But I5? We cannot use I? Because we know I is not present? So invalid? 
  Also: TANSY? TANSY: T1 A2 N3 S4 Y5? Wait: A at position2? But we cannot use A at position2? So invalid? 
  MANAS? MANAS: M1 A2 N3 A4 S5? A2? invalid? 

How about words like: VASAL? VASAL: V1 A2 S3 A4 L5? A2? invalid? 

So I think: position5? There are words? LAMSA? Not a word? 

So we are left with position1 or position3 for A? 

Now: should we guess A at position1? or position3? 

By guessing A at position1? we can test it? And if it's ✓? Then we know? And if not? Then we know it must be position3 or higher? Later? 

Similarly? By guessing A at position3? we can test? 

But note: if we guess A at position1? and we get ✓? Then we know the first letter? And also S at the fourth? Then we can ignore position3? But wait: position3? We don't know? 

But also? if we get A at position1 ✓? Then we have two letters? and we know the rest must be letters not R,I,E? 

Alternatively? if we guess CHASM? A at position3? and it turns out A is actually at position3? Then we know first letter? Also?

But if we guess A at position1? and A is actually at position3? Then it will be marked as '-'? Meaning present? but not here? Which we already know? So no new information? Except that it is not at position1? Then we know it must be position3? 

So: 

  Option1: guess ANTSY?
    If A is at position1? then we get ✓ for A? and then we know: word begins with A? and then _ , _ , S? and the fifth letter? Also? 
    If not? Then A gets '-'? and then we know A must be at position3? Because we've avoided position2? and we can't have it at position4? which is S? 

But wait: the secret word: 
  position4 is S? 
  The letter A? cannot be at position2? and if it's at position4? Then A=S? That can't be? So A must be either position1 or position3 or position5? But we couldn't find words for position5? Which leaves? position1 and 3? 

Therefore, if we guess ANTSY? 
  Possible outcomes:
    If A is at position1? then ✓? 
    If A is at position3? then at our guess position1? A → we get '-'? 
    If A is at position5? which is very rare? then we get '-'? 

But we haven't tested position5 so far? 

Alternatively? Guess a word that tests two positions? But we have limited choices? Let me try to think: 

Word: PLAYS? Has S at position5? No? 

Another idea: guess a word that puts A at position5? Even if we didn't find? We can create a word? But we must use English words. 

What about the word: MASSA? Not valid? 

Word: TASSA? No? 

Word: PASSA? Not common? Let me list? 

Valid words: 
  MANAS? But not standard? and A at position2? invalid? 
  KANS? 4 letters? 
  There might be less common words? 

Another possibility: YEAHS? But E? We cannot use E? 

So probably? We cannot cover position5? Therefore? it's either 1 or 3? 

Thus? ANTSY would test position1? 

But? What about the word: CHASM? Which tests position3? 

Given this? I prefer to cover? maybe test A at position3? Why? Because position1? We can test later? But note: we are at the second guess? and we have 6 tries? 

Also? we can choose ANTSY? because it tests? more common letters? N, T, and Y? 

Alternatively? What is more efficient? 

We can choose a word that covers? two possibilities? But it's hard? 

Therefore? I suggest? guessing? ANTSY? 

But wait? let me see? ANTSY: if the secret word has A at position3? then our guess: ANTSY? 
  Position1: A? → not present? This secret word? Then we mark A: 
    If the secret word has A at position3? Then our A at position1? should get 'x'? But wait: it would be marked as '-'? because A exists in the word? 
    Even though same letter? Because A exists? but not? at position1? Then we get '-'? 

But wait: this confusion? 

Actually? standard rules: 
  For ANTSY? against a secret word? say? at the secret word? A at position3: 
    Secret: _ _ A S _
    Guess: ANTSY: 
      Position1: A? → the secret word? Does it have A at position1? No? but it has A? at position3? So this A in position1? should be marked as '-'? 
      Then position2: N? If the secret has letter at position2? We don't care? 
      Position3: T? if the secret has T? → but we don't know? 
      Position4: S? ✓? 
      Position5: Y? 

So? We get? A at position1 marked as '-'? meaning? A exists? but not at position1? 

Then we know A? must be at? position3? or 5? 

Because? we excluded position2? and position1? then? 

Similarly? if the secret word had A at position5? then we also get '-' at A (position1) of ANTSY? 

But how do we distinguish between A at position3 and A at position5? 

That's a problem? 

After ANTSY? if A at position1? marked as? then ✓? or if not? then '-'? meaning A exists? not at position1? However? then we still have ambiguity? 

To avoid that? we can choose a word that has A at position3? so we test directly position3? 

Therefore? CHASM? might be better? 

CHASM: 
  Positions: 
    1: C? new? 
    2: H? new? 
    3: A? Then feedback: 
        If the secret has A at position3? then ✓? 
        If it has A? elsewhere (position1 or 5)? Then '-'? 
    4: S? ✓? 
    5: M? new? 

But if the secret has A at position1? Then CHASM:
  Position1: C? compared to A? → not match? but secret has A at position1? which is not in our guess's letter1? But wait? our guess's letter1 is C? Then? 
        C? should be checked: not present? → x? 
        Then? A? at position3? even if? the secret has a A? at position3? But wait? it also has one at position1? Then we have:

        Secret: A? _ _ S _? and at position3? we don't know? 

        But: the secret has A? and our guess has A at position3? Then if the secret has A at position3? then it's ✓? Otherwise? '-'? 

        If the secret has A at position1 and also position3? Then we would get: 
          C: x (because not in? or if A is duplicated? then: 
          We would have A in guess at position3? matched to A at position3? then ✓? 
          And the A at position1 of secret? not matched? 

        If the secret has A only at position1? then our A at position3? is not at the correct position? but present? so '-'? 

        So the feedback would show: 
          Position1: x? 
          Position3: ✓? if A at position3? Or '-'? if A exists? but not at position3? 

But the secret cannot have both A at position1 and position3? Because we already know that A is present? we don't know about multiplicities? 

But? importantly? by not testing position1? we can miss? 

However? Given that we can only test one position at a time? 

So I propose CHASM? which tests A at position3? 

Then after the feedback? we will know:
  For A?:
    If we get ✓ at position3? then we know A? is at position3? 
    If we get '-'? Which would be at position3? then? that means A is not at position3? but present? then we know A must be at position1? or position5? 
    If we get x? Cannot? Then we know nothing? 

But wait: no? We know A exists? So in CHASM? 
  If the secret word has A at position3? then ✓? 
  If the secret word has A but not at position3? then '-'? 

Since position3 must be matched? 

Therefore? I think CHASM? is better? 

Alternatively? if we use a word that has A at position1 and also includes? a common letter at position5? But no? 

Therefore? I choose CHASM? 

So let's go with CHASM?After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":  
- **R, I, E are eliminated** since they are marked as absent (x).  
- **S is fixed at position 4** (✓) in the secret word.  
- **A is present but not in position 2** (-), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  

Given the constraints and common English words:  
- The secret word must fit the pattern `_ _ _ S _`, containing the letter A (not in position 2).  
- Letters R, I, E are excluded.  

For this second guess:  
- **Testing position 3 for A** helps narrow down its location efficiently.  
- **CHASM (C1 H2 A3 S4 M5)** is chosen because:  
  - It tests A in position 3 (to resolve ambiguity).  
  - Includes new common letters (C, H, M) to probe the word structure.  
  - Avoids eliminated letters (R, I, E) and the forbidden position 2 for A.  
- If A is in position 3, we get direct confirmation; otherwise, the feedback (- or ✓) will clarify A's true position or reveal new letters.",Guess 2: CHASM -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(-) S(✓) M(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,abyss,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since we have no prior information, we want a starting word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L, etc.).
 One popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"", but let me think also about maximizing information.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. are good. But note we are allowed 6 tries.

 Considering the feedback for the first guess is crucial because it sets the stage.

 I will choose ""SLATE"". Why?
 - It has two of the most common vowels: A and E.
 - It uses common consonants: S, L, T.

 But note: we are not told any constraints and must produce a valid English word.

 Let me confirm ""SLATE"" is a word: yes, it means a thin piece of rock or a list of candidates.

 However, let me think about another popular one: ""RAISE"" is also good because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 However, in the instructions, the example used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We are free to choose.

 But note: the feedback symbols:
   ✓ : correct letter and correct position
   - : letter in word but wrong position
   x : letter not in word

 We want to maximize the information we get on the first try. That is, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 According to some analyses, the letters that appear most frequently in English 5-letter words are (in order): E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, ... 

 So words like ""LATER"" or ""ALTER"" are good? But let's see:

 I think ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because it uses three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S) that are very common.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word? Actually, ROATE is a valid word meaning an amount of revenue collected. But it is obscure.

 Another candidate is ""CRANE"". It uses C, R, A, N, E. That's also good.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: SLATE -> S, L, A, T, E
 Option 2: RAISE -> R, A, I, S, E
 Option 3: CRANE -> C, R, A, N, E

 Which has the highest probability of containing letters in the secret word?

 Since I'm not sure, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:

 - It has three vowels: A, E and two consonants C, R, N (N is common too).
 - C and R are among the top consonants.

 Alternatively, note that the letter E is the most common vowel and the most common letter. So having E at the end is good.

 Decision: I'll start with ""CRANE"".

 But wait: in the example, the secret word was ""BRISK"". If I guessed ""CRANE"":
   C is in ""BRISK""? No -> then x
   R is in ""BRISK""? Yes -> but in position 2? In BRISK, R is at position 2, so that would be ✓? But wait, the secret word is BRISK and CRANE: 
        C vs B -> not same -> so C: x
        R vs R -> same -> R: ✓
        A vs I -> different -> A: is A in BRISK? No -> x
        N vs S -> different -> N: not in BRISK -> x
        E vs K -> different -> E: not in BRISK -> x
   So we get R in the correct position and the rest x.

 That gives us one letter and position, but we don't get information on other letters being present.

 Alternatively, if I choose a word with letters that are more common? Let's try ""SLATE"" on BRISK:

   S: BRISK has S? Yes -> position? S is at position 1? Guess has S at position 1? Secret word: position 4 is S (if we count 1-indexed: B=1, R=2, I=3, S=4, K=5). So guess letter in position1: S -> secret position4: S -> so this is wrong position -> then '-' 
   L: in BRISK? -> No -> x
   A: No -> x
   T: No -> x
   E: No -> x

 Then we get one '-' and four x's. So we know S is present but in the wrong position.

 So which gives more information? In both cases we got one valuable piece. But with ""CRANE"", we know R is in position2 and that's fixed. With ""SLATE"" we know S is present but not in position1 -> then it must be in positions 2,3,4, or5.

 But note: we can get more than one letter? That depends on the secret word.

 Another candidate: ""ROAST"" -> let's try on BRISK:
   R: position1 vs position2 of secret -> not same -> but present -> '-'
   O: not present -> x
   A: not present -> x
   S: BRISK has S at position4 -> guess has S at position3? -> so no -> present -> '-'
   T: not present -> x

 Then we get two '-' and three x. We know R and S are present but not in position1 and position3 respectively.

 How about ""RAISE"" on BRISK?
   R: present -> compare position? position1 of guess vs secret: R at position1? secret has R at position2 -> so wrong -> '-'
   A: not present -> x
   I: BRISK has I at position3 -> guess has at position2? -> so wrong -> '-'
   S: present -> at position4? guess has at position4? -> no, at position3? guess position3: I -> then S is at position4? In guess, S is at position4? But secret has S at position4? 
        Actually: 
        Guess: R (1), A(2), I(3), S(4), E(5)
        Secret: B(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), K(5)
        So:
          R: wrong position -> '-'
          A: x
          I: position matches? guess position3 and secret position3 -> same -> ✓
          S: position4? also same -> ✓
          E: x
        So the feedback would be: R(-), A(x), I(✓), S(✓), E(x)

 Then we get two ✓ and one '-'. That's great.

 Therefore, ""RAISE"" seems to have the potential for more hits? But note that we are showing an example where it works well for BRISK.

 However, we don't know the secret word. Therefore, we need a word that gives maximum information in the average case.

 According to some sources, the starting words that are optimal include CRANE, SALET, ROATE, SOARE, etc.

 However, I remember that ""RAISE"" is one of the top starting words because it uses R, A, I, S, E which are among the top 10 most common letters.

 So I will go with ""RAISE"".

 Let me double-check: 
   R is the 3rd most common letter (in the top list I recalled: E, A, R, ...) -> so R is very common.
   A is the 2nd most common.
   I is a common vowel -> 7th?
   S is 8th?
   E -> the most common.

 So it's a good mix.

 Therefore, my first guess will be ""RAISE"".I need to make an effective first guess for this Wordle-style game. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I gain from the feedback. This means prioritizing common letters in English 5-letter words.

After analyzing letter frequency:
- Vowels like A, E, I, O are common
- Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are frequent
- Ideally, the word should include several high-frequency letters

Words like ""RAISE"" work well because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- Uses 5 distinct letters to maximize coverage
- R, A, I, S, E are all top-10 frequent letters in English  

Alternative starters like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also strong, but ""RAISE"" has slight advantages:
- Higher vowel density helps test frequent letter categories
- Ending in E exploits a common word-ending pattern
- Balanced letter distribution improves feedback clarity

This guess will efficiently reveal:
- Which letters in {R, A, I, S, E} exist in the secret word
- Which positions might be partially correct  
- Vowel/consonant relationships to guide subsequent guesses

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x -> not present in the word
  A: - -> present but in the wrong position
  I: x -> not present
  S: ✓ -> correct position (so S must be the fourth letter of the secret word)
  E: x -> not present

So what we know:
- The secret word has the letter **A**, but not in the second position (where we had A in RAISE). However, it could be in any position except 2? Actually, the feedback only says it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in positions 1, 3, 5? Remember that positions are fixed: 
    Position1: R -> not in word
    Position2: A -> in word but not here
    Position3: I -> not in word
    Position4: S -> correct and in position
    Position5: E -> not in word

- Therefore, the secret word has:
  - S at the fourth position? Wait: the fourth letter is S. Since we wrote RAISE: 
      R (pos1), A (pos2), I (pos3), S (pos4), E (pos5)
  So the fourth letter of the secret word is S.

- The letter A must appear somewhere else: so positions 1, 3, or 5? But note: position5 is not available because we also know E is not present and also note:
  We know that position1 cannot be A? Actually, we cannot be certain until we test. But we know A is not in position2. 

However, we also know:
- R is not in the word at all? So any position? So we must avoid R in the rest of the word.
- Similarly, I and E are absent.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains the letter A (but not at position 2) and S (at position 4)
- Does not contain R, I, E.

Since we have S fixed at position4, we can now make a new guess.

We must also consider:
- The word must have 5 letters, and we know two: the fourth is S, and A is present somewhere else (positions 1,3,5?).

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, or 5? But position5 is last, which is common for vowels? But wait, A can be at the beginning or middle.

Moreover, we have to pick a word that excludes R, I, E.

Common English words with S in the fourth position and containing A.

Looking for patterns: we can represent the word as: _ _ _ S _

And A must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5? But note: also the second position is already excluded? And we may consider that A could be in the fifth? But we don't know.

But also remember: we have not set the rest of the letters. So we need to guess a word that:
1. Has the fourth letter S.
2. Contains the letter A (but not as the second letter? But actually the feedback said A is in the wrong position, meaning specifically that it is not in position2? But in the new word, we can put A anywhere except that we know it's not in position2? Actually, we are guessing another word so we can put A wherever we want? But the feedback tells us that in the secret word, A is in a different position than the second.

But importantly, we should avoid using R, I, E anywhere.

Now, we can choose a word that has A in either position1, 3, or 5? And also we know the fourth is S.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information. In particular, common consonants and vowels.

What letters can we use? We can try to include other common letters that are not excluded: so avoid R, I, E. Common letters: O, T, L, N, etc.

Idea: try to put A in position1? Or position3? Or position5? Probably we should test a few possibilities? And also include new letters.

Let me think of words with S in the fourth position? For example:
- The word ends with S? But here is in the fourth position? So the fifth letter can be something else.

Pattern: __ __ __ S __

So the last letter is the fifth.

Words ending with ""S_"" are not common? Actually, no: the word has five letters? So the fifth is one character.

Examples of words that have S in the fourth position? 
  GLASS -> G L A S S? Wait: this has five letters: positions? 
      G1, L2, A3, S4, S5? But that's five letters. Then S is the fourth letter? Yes.

But in GLASS: 
  Letters: G, L, A, S, S? Then S is the fourth letter? And then the fifth letter is also S? So two S's? But our feedback didn't say anything about duplicate letters? So it's possible.

But we know that A is present: in GLASS, A is at position3.

But note: we have feedback that A is not at position2? Which is true? But wait, the word could have duplicate letters? But our first guess RAISE didn't have duplicates? So maybe duplicates are allowed?

Now let's see the feedback: we had RAISE -> A was marked as '-' meaning present: so the secret word must have at least one A. In GLASS, it has A? Yes. But also note: GLASS has two S: but we have S at position4 being ✓, so if we guess GLASS and the secret word has an S at position4? Then at position5? Let me check.

Actually, our feedback indicated that only S was fixed? So we need to see how the game handles duplicates? The rules don't clarify? But typically:

Assume standard Wordle rules: if there is one S in the secret word but two S in the guess, then one might get marked as green and the other as yellow? Or if the secret word has two, then both might get yellow/green accordingly.

But in our case, we have S at position4: ✓. And then if there's another S? Then we don't know until we see.

But since we don't have information about duplicate S? We are not forbidden? But also note: we didn't see an extra S? Because in RAISE, we only had one S? So if the secret word had an extra S? Then our RAISE wouldn't have shown in feedback? Actually, the feedback would only show what exists.

For example, if the secret word is GLASS? Then it has S at position4 and also position5. Then for RAISE:

  RAISE: 
    R -> not in GLASS? So x (correct)
    A -> in GLASS? At position3 -> so present: wait, we would get marked by '-'? And it was: A is '-'? Because it's present? But not at position2? So feedback: R(x) A(-) ... 
    I -> not present: so x? Correct.
    S -> at position4: RAISE has S at position4? Secret word has S at position4? So ✓? Correct. 
    E -> not present? In GLASS? So E: x? Correct.

But note: in GLASS, it has an extra S? But our RAISE has only one S? Then the feedback wouldn't mark the fifth S? So we don't know? Therefore, we might need to consider duplicate letters.

But for this guess, we can pick a word that doesn't have duplicates? Or do we? Actually not necessary.

I'll try to pick a word with S at position4? And containing A? And avoiding R, I, E? And also we want to test other common letters? Like O, T, L, N, etc.

Possible words:

Let me consider: 
  A: at position1? words like: A _ _ S _ 
      Examples: ANSWERS? More than 5 letters? 
      5-letter words: ANTSY? ANTSY: A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5? So S is at position4? Good. Also: ANTSY has A at 1? And contains T, N, Y? And avoids R, I, E? Then let's consider:

But note: in ANTSY, the A is at position1? This would be a good candidate? Then we can check:
  If the secret word has A at position1? Then we would expect a ✓? Or if it is elsewhere? 
  Also, we can test N, T, S? Note S is already at position4? So it's known? 

Alternatively: put A at position5: then pattern: _ _ _ S A? Words? Like? 
  CONGA? CONGA: C1 O2 N3 G4 A5? Wait: position4 is G? We need position4 to be S? So that doesn't work.

Or words with A in the middle: position3? Pattern: _ _ A S _ 
  Words: CLASS? CLASS: C1 L2 A3 S4 S5? But has two S? So CLASS? 
      CLASS has S at position4? And A at position3? And letters C, L, S? Also avoids R, I, E? Then yes.

But wait: CLASS has two S? Then if the secret word has only one S? That might cause feedback issue? But let's see: if the secret word has exactly one S at position4, then in CLASS guess:
  C: ? 
  L: ?
  A: ✓? If A is at position3? 
  First S: position4? ✓
  Second S: position5? then should be marked as 'x'? Because there is no second S? 

Actually, the feedback rules: 
  If the secret word has a letter only once, and you guess two, then the first occurrence of the letter (in the guess) that can be matched will get a ✓ or -, and the redundant one will be marked as x? Typically? 

But the rules says: 
  ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols""

And the symbols are assigned independently? But actually, the standard Wordle method is: 

  First check for exact matches? Then mark those letters? Then check the remaining for misplaced.

Therefore: 
  Consider secret word: GLASS? 
    Guess: CLASS? 
      Positions: 
        Position4: S? Secret has S at position4? → S4 ✓? 
        Then for the fifth S? The secret has another S? So that S is also present? But then we have to mark it? But wait, the secret has two S? And the guess has two S? And the first one at position4 is already matched? So the fifth position: S? matches? But wait: the secret has S at position4 and also at position5? So the guess fifth S? Then it would be matched? So ✓? 

  Alternatively: secret word was something else? Only one S? Then CLASS:
        Position4: S (secret has S at position4) → ✓
        Position5: S (secret has only one S? Then already matched? Therefore, no S left → x? 

But since we haven't seen the secret word? Let me not overcomplicate.

But note: we know from the feedback that A is present? But we don't know if it appears once or more? Similarly, the secret word may have duplicate letters? So we have to be careful.

Given that, I will try to find words that avoid duplicate letters? To make feedback cleaner? Or accept that duplicates are possible.

But in our next guess, we can avoid using duplicate letters? Because we want maximum information? 

So let me avoid duplicates? So the word has exactly five distinct letters? But we have to? Not required? But for guessing, using distinct letters can help get information for other letters? 

Now: our constraints:
  Position4: must be S? 
  The word must contain A? (exactly one? we don't know? but at least one) and avoid R, I, E? 
  We can test other letters? 

Example words:
  ANTSY? I think ANTSY is a valid word? (antsy: nervous)

ANTSY: 
  Positions:
    1: A? Then we test A: which could be ✓ if the secret word has A at start? Or '-' if elsewhere? Or if duplicate? 
  We also test N, T, S? But S is at position4? fixed? 
  Letters: A, N, T, S, Y? Distinct? and avoid R,I,E? 

Also consider words like:
  CAMPS? CAMPS: C1, A2, M3, P4, S5? Oh wait: position4 is P? But we need position4 to be S? 

Also: GASSY? G1 A2 S3 S4 Y5? Has duplicate S? So position4 is S? Good? But then A is at position2? But we cannot put A at position2? Because in our first guess, A was at position2? And it's marked as '-' meaning not here? But wait: that was for the word RAISE? Now we are guessing GASSY? 

Important: the feedback on the first guess told us that A is not in position2? So in the secret word, A is in a position other than 2? 

Therefore, in our next guess? We must not put A at position2? Because we know it's not!? Exactly? 

So if we put A at position2 in our guess? Then what? 
  In GASSY: A at position2? Then the secret word? If the secret word has A at position2? Why was it marked as '-'? That is confusing? 

We must be careful: the first guess's feedback: A was marked as '-' meaning that the letter A exists in the word? But not in position2? So we know that in the secret word, position2 is NOT A? 

Therefore, if we put A at position2 in a new guess? Then we will definitely get a '-' (if the secret word actually has A?)?

But wait: if the secret word has A at position2? Then it would have been ✓? But it wasn't? So we know position2 is not A? So for GASSY? We are putting A at position2? Then the feedback would be: '-'? But we already know it's not at position2? So we don't gain new information? Worse, we are wasting a slot? So we should avoid putting A at position2? 

Moreover, we know it's not at position2? So any guess should place A elsewhere.

Therefore, in GASSY? it's invalid? Because we are putting A at position2? Then the feedback will say: yes, A is in the word? But not at position2? But we already know? So what's the point? We should put A somewhere else? Maybe to test another position? 

Actually, we can put A at position2? to test? But no? because we know it's not? So we are sure? So putting A at position2? Then we will get a '-'? But we know? So no new information? 

So we should avoid? 

Therefore, avoid using A at position2? in any guess? 

So let me find words with:
  Pattern: _ _ _ S ? 
  Must include A? but not at position2? 
  Avoid R, I, E? 
  And using other common letters? 

Options:
  Position1: A? Then words like: A _ _ S _ ? 
      Example: ANTSY? 
      Also: ABYSS? has a lot of S? so duplicate? 
             ABYSS: A1,B2,Y3,S4,S5? Duplicate S? 
  Position3: A? Then words: _ _ A S ? 
      Example: CHASM? CHASM: C1 H2 A3 S4 M5? 
      Also: CLASP? but more than 5? 

  Position5: A? Then words: _ _ _ S A? 
      Examples: MANSA? but obscure? 
      Words: There are words? LAMPS? but position4: P? 
         How about PATHS? PATHS: P1 A2 T3 H4 S5? Now S is at position5? We need position4? 
         Not working? 
         Words ending with SA? Like MANSA? Or VISTA? VISTA: V1 I2 S3 T4 A5? Then S at position3? 

Conclusion: 
  Positions for A: 1 or 3? Because we cannot use position2? and position5 might be difficult? 

Let me consider: 
  ANTSY: A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5? 
      This contains A at start? So test position1? Also N at position2? T at position3? Avoids R,I,E? 

But wait: we also know that position2? In ANTSY: we are using N at position2? What if the secret word has A at position2? No? We know it doesn't? So no conflict? But we are using N? which is new? 

Also: CHASM? C1, H2, A3, S4, M5? 
      Then A at position3? We are testing? 

Which word is better? 

We also need to cover more letters? So ANTSY: tests A, N, T, Y? 
CHASM: tests C, H, A, M? 

Both are valid words? 

Now: common letters? 
  N and T are more common than C, H, M? So ANTSY might cover more common letters? 

Let me see the frequencies:

  Letter frequencies (from high to low): 
    E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, Y, F, V, K, W, Z, X, J, Q

So A: high? Now we are testing A? But we know A exists? so we don't need to confirm existence? Instead, we want to pin down the position? 

But also we test other letters? 

For ANTSY: 
  Letters: A (already known? but we want to test its position?), N, T, S (known? already ✓ at position4? so only position4 must be S? In our guess we set S at position4? which should always be? so it will be ✓ again? 

Therefore, guess ANTSY: 
  Positions:
    1: A? → if the secret word has A at position1? then ✓? otherwise, if elsewhere? then '-'? 
    2: N? → new letter? 
    3: T? → new letter? 
    4: S? → we already know? ✓? 
    5: Y? → new letter? 

Similarly for CHASM: 
  1: C → if present? 
  2: H → ? 
  3: A? → if secret word has A at position3? then ✓? 
  4: S? → ✓? 
  5: M → new? 

Between ANTSY and CHASM? The commonality: 
  ANTSY tests A at 1? and N, T, Y? 
  CHASM tests A at 3? and C, H, M? 

Which is better? 

We know that A is in the word? But we don't know the position? So we can test position1? if we get ✓? Then we know!? If not? Then it must be position3? or 5? But wait, are there other positions? We excluded position2? and we haven't tested position5? but we said position5 words are hard? 

In our constraints? Pattern: _ _ _ S _? So the first three letters? or fifth? 

Also, we might have words where A is at position5? But we need S in the fourth? 

Let me find: are there words with A at position5? and S at position4? 
  Words ending with SA? Actually, most English words with S at fourth? Then fifth? Not necessarily? 

Examples: 
  QUASI? QUASI: Q1 U2 A3 S4 I5? But I5? We cannot use I? Because we know I is not present? So invalid? 
  Also: TANSY? TANSY: T1 A2 N3 S4 Y5? Wait: A at position2? But we cannot use A at position2? So invalid? 
  MANAS? MANAS: M1 A2 N3 A4 S5? A2? invalid? 

How about words like: VASAL? VASAL: V1 A2 S3 A4 L5? A2? invalid? 

So I think: position5? There are words? LAMSA? Not a word? 

So we are left with position1 or position3 for A? 

Now: should we guess A at position1? or position3? 

By guessing A at position1? we can test it? And if it's ✓? Then we know? And if not? Then we know it must be position3 or higher? Later? 

Similarly? By guessing A at position3? we can test? 

But note: if we guess A at position1? and we get ✓? Then we know the first letter? And also S at the fourth? Then we can ignore position3? But wait: position3? We don't know? 

But also? if we get A at position1 ✓? Then we have two letters? and we know the rest must be letters not R,I,E? 

Alternatively? if we guess CHASM? A at position3? and it turns out A is actually at position3? Then we know first letter? Also?

But if we guess A at position1? and A is actually at position3? Then it will be marked as '-'? Meaning present? but not here? Which we already know? So no new information? Except that it is not at position1? Then we know it must be position3? 

So: 

  Option1: guess ANTSY?
    If A is at position1? then we get ✓ for A? and then we know: word begins with A? and then _ , _ , S? and the fifth letter? Also? 
    If not? Then A gets '-'? and then we know A must be at position3? Because we've avoided position2? and we can't have it at position4? which is S? 

But wait: the secret word: 
  position4 is S? 
  The letter A? cannot be at position2? and if it's at position4? Then A=S? That can't be? So A must be either position1 or position3 or position5? But we couldn't find words for position5? Which leaves? position1 and 3? 

Therefore, if we guess ANTSY? 
  Possible outcomes:
    If A is at position1? then ✓? 
    If A is at position3? then at our guess position1? A → we get '-'? 
    If A is at position5? which is very rare? then we get '-'? 

But we haven't tested position5 so far? 

Alternatively? Guess a word that tests two positions? But we have limited choices? Let me try to think: 

Word: PLAYS? Has S at position5? No? 

Another idea: guess a word that puts A at position5? Even if we didn't find? We can create a word? But we must use English words. 

What about the word: MASSA? Not valid? 

Word: TASSA? No? 

Word: PASSA? Not common? Let me list? 

Valid words: 
  MANAS? But not standard? and A at position2? invalid? 
  KANS? 4 letters? 
  There might be less common words? 

Another possibility: YEAHS? But E? We cannot use E? 

So probably? We cannot cover position5? Therefore? it's either 1 or 3? 

Thus? ANTSY would test position1? 

But? What about the word: CHASM? Which tests position3? 

Given this? I prefer to cover? maybe test A at position3? Why? Because position1? We can test later? But note: we are at the second guess? and we have 6 tries? 

Also? we can choose ANTSY? because it tests? more common letters? N, T, and Y? 

Alternatively? What is more efficient? 

We can choose a word that covers? two possibilities? But it's hard? 

Therefore? I suggest? guessing? ANTSY? 

But wait? let me see? ANTSY: if the secret word has A at position3? then our guess: ANTSY? 
  Position1: A? → not present? This secret word? Then we mark A: 
    If the secret word has A at position3? Then our A at position1? should get 'x'? But wait: it would be marked as '-'? because A exists in the word? 
    Even though same letter? Because A exists? but not? at position1? Then we get '-'? 

But wait: this confusion? 

Actually? standard rules: 
  For ANTSY? against a secret word? say? at the secret word? A at position3: 
    Secret: _ _ A S _
    Guess: ANTSY: 
      Position1: A? → the secret word? Does it have A at position1? No? but it has A? at position3? So this A in position1? should be marked as '-'? 
      Then position2: N? If the secret has letter at position2? We don't care? 
      Position3: T? if the secret has T? → but we don't know? 
      Position4: S? ✓? 
      Position5: Y? 

So? We get? A at position1 marked as '-'? meaning? A exists? but not at position1? 

Then we know A? must be at? position3? or 5? 

Because? we excluded position2? and position1? then? 

Similarly? if the secret word had A at position5? then we also get '-' at A (position1) of ANTSY? 

But how do we distinguish between A at position3 and A at position5? 

That's a problem? 

After ANTSY? if A at position1? marked as? then ✓? or if not? then '-'? meaning A exists? not at position1? However? then we still have ambiguity? 

To avoid that? we can choose a word that has A at position3? so we test directly position3? 

Therefore? CHASM? might be better? 

CHASM: 
  Positions: 
    1: C? new? 
    2: H? new? 
    3: A? Then feedback: 
        If the secret has A at position3? then ✓? 
        If it has A? elsewhere (position1 or 5)? Then '-'? 
    4: S? ✓? 
    5: M? new? 

But if the secret has A at position1? Then CHASM:
  Position1: C? compared to A? → not match? but secret has A at position1? which is not in our guess's letter1? But wait? our guess's letter1 is C? Then? 
        C? should be checked: not present? → x? 
        Then? A? at position3? even if? the secret has a A? at position3? But wait? it also has one at position1? Then we have:

        Secret: A? _ _ S _? and at position3? we don't know? 

        But: the secret has A? and our guess has A at position3? Then if the secret has A at position3? then it's ✓? Otherwise? '-'? 

        If the secret has A at position1 and also position3? Then we would get: 
          C: x (because not in? or if A is duplicated? then: 
          We would have A in guess at position3? matched to A at position3? then ✓? 
          And the A at position1 of secret? not matched? 

        If the secret has A only at position1? then our A at position3? is not at the correct position? but present? so '-'? 

        So the feedback would show: 
          Position1: x? 
          Position3: ✓? if A at position3? Or '-'? if A exists? but not at position3? 

But the secret cannot have both A at position1 and position3? Because we already know that A is present? we don't know about multiplicities? 

But? importantly? by not testing position1? we can miss? 

However? Given that we can only test one position at a time? 

So I propose CHASM? which tests A at position3? 

Then after the feedback? we will know:
  For A?:
    If we get ✓ at position3? then we know A? is at position3? 
    If we get '-'? Which would be at position3? then? that means A is not at position3? but present? then we know A must be at position1? or position5? 
    If we get x? Cannot? Then we know nothing? 

But wait: no? We know A exists? So in CHASM? 
  If the secret word has A at position3? then ✓? 
  If the secret word has A but not at position3? then '-'? 

Since position3 must be matched? 

Therefore? I think CHASM? is better? 

Alternatively? if we use a word that has A at position1 and also includes? a common letter at position5? But no? 

Therefore? I choose CHASM? 

So let's go with CHASM?After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":  
- **R, I, E are eliminated** since they are marked as absent (x).  
- **S is fixed at position 4** (✓) in the secret word.  
- **A is present but not in position 2** (-), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  

Given the constraints and common English words:  
- The secret word must fit the pattern `_ _ _ S _`, containing the letter A (not in position 2).  
- Letters R, I, E are excluded.  

For this second guess:  
- **Testing position 3 for A** helps narrow down its location efficiently.  
- **CHASM (C1 H2 A3 S4 M5)** is chosen because:  
  - It tests A in position 3 (to resolve ambiguity).  
  - Includes new common letters (C, H, M) to probe the word structure.  
  - Avoids eliminated letters (R, I, E) and the forbidden position 2 for A.  
- If A is in position 3, we get direct confirmation; otherwise, the feedback (- or ✓) will clarify A's true position or reveal new letters.

Since we have no prior information, we want a starting word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L, etc.).\n One popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"", but let me think also about maximizing information.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. are good. But note we are allowed 6 tries.\n\n Considering the feedback for the first guess is crucial because it sets the stage.\n\n I will choose ""SLATE"". Why?\n - It has two of the most common vowels: A and E.\n - It uses common consonants: S, L, T.\n\n But note: we are not told any constraints and must produce a valid English word.\n\n Let me confirm ""SLATE"" is a word: yes, it means a thin piece of rock or a list of candidates.\n\n However, let me think about another popular one: ""RAISE"" is also good because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n\n However, in the instructions, the example used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We are free to choose.\n\n But note: the feedback symbols:\n   ✓ : correct letter and correct position\n   - : letter in word but wrong position\n   x : letter not in word\n\n We want to maximize the information we get on the first try. That is, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n According to some analyses, the letters that appear most frequently in English 5-letter words are (in order): E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, ... \n\n So words like ""LATER"" or ""ALTER"" are good? But let\'s see:\n\n I think ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because it uses three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S) that are very common.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word? Actually, ROATE is a valid word meaning an amount of revenue collected. But it is obscure.\n\n Another candidate is ""CRANE"". It uses C, R, A, N, E. That\'s also good.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: SLATE -> S, L, A, T, E\n Option 2: RAISE -> R, A, I, S, E\n Option 3: CRANE -> C, R, A, N, E\n\n Which has the highest probability of containing letters in the secret word?\n\n Since I\'m not sure, I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because:\n\n - It has three vowels: A, E and two consonants C, R, N (N is common too).\n - C and R are among the top consonants.\n\n Alternatively, note that the letter E is the most common vowel and the most common letter. So having E at the end is good.\n\n Decision: I\'ll start with ""CRANE"".\n\n But wait: in the example, the secret word was ""BRISK"". If I guessed ""CRANE"":\n   C is in ""BRISK""? No -> then x\n   R is in ""BRISK""? Yes -> but in position 2? In BRISK, R is at position 2, so that would be ✓? But wait, the secret word is BRISK and CRANE: \n        C vs B -> not same -> so C: x\n        R vs R -> same -> R: ✓\n        A vs I -> different -> A: is A in BRISK? No -> x\n        N vs S -> different -> N: not in BRISK -> x\n        E vs K -> different -> E: not in BRISK -> x\n   So we get R in the correct position and the rest x.\n\n That gives us one letter and position, but we don\'t get information on other letters being present.\n\n Alternatively, if I choose a word with letters that are more common? Let\'s try ""SLATE"" on BRISK:\n\n   S: BRISK has S? Yes -> position? S is at position 1? Guess has S at position 1? Secret word: position 4 is S (if we count 1-indexed: B=1, R=2, I=3, S=4, K=5). So guess letter in position1: S -> secret position4: S -> so this is wrong position -> then \'-\' \n   L: in BRISK? -> No -> x\n   A: No -> x\n   T: No -> x\n   E: No -> x\n\n Then we get one \'-\' and four x\'s. So we know S is present but in the wrong position.\n\n So which gives more information? In both cases we got one valuable piece. But with ""CRANE"", we know R is in position2 and that\'s fixed. With ""SLATE"" we know S is present but not in position1 -> then it must be in positions 2,3,4, or5.\n\n But note: we can get more than one letter? That depends on the secret word.\n\n Another candidate: ""ROAST"" -> let\'s try on BRISK:\n   R: position1 vs position2 of secret -> not same -> but present -> \'-\'\n   O: not present -> x\n   A: not present -> x\n   S: BRISK has S at position4 -> guess has S at position3? -> so no -> present -> \'-\'\n   T: not present -> x\n\n Then we get two \'-\' and three x. We know R and S are present but not in position1 and position3 respectively.\n\n How about ""RAISE"" on BRISK?\n   R: present -> compare position? position1 of guess vs secret: R at position1? secret has R at position2 -> so wrong -> \'-\'\n   A: not present -> x\n   I: BRISK has I at position3 -> guess has at position2? -> so wrong -> \'-\'\n   S: present -> at position4? guess has at position4? -> no, at position3? guess position3: I -> then S is at position4? In guess, S is at position4? But secret has S at position4? \n        Actually: \n        Guess: R (1), A(2), I(3), S(4), E(5)\n        Secret: B(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), K(5)\n        So:\n          R: wrong position -> \'-\'\n          A: x\n          I: position matches? guess position3 and secret position3 -> same -> ✓\n          S: position4? also same -> ✓\n          E: x\n        So the feedback would be: R(-), A(x), I(✓), S(✓), E(x)\n\n Then we get two ✓ and one \'-\'. That\'s great.\n\n Therefore, ""RAISE"" seems to have the potential for more hits? But note that we are showing an example where it works well for BRISK.\n\n However, we don\'t know the secret word. Therefore, we need a word that gives maximum information in the average case.\n\n According to some sources, the starting words that are optimal include CRANE, SALET, ROATE, SOARE, etc.\n\n However, I remember that ""RAISE"" is one of the top starting words because it uses R, A, I, S, E which are among the top 10 most common letters.\n\n So I will go with ""RAISE"".\n\n Let me double-check: \n   R is the 3rd most common letter (in the top list I recalled: E, A, R, ...) -> so R is very common.\n   A is the 2nd most common.\n   I is a common vowel -> 7th?\n   S is 8th?\n   E -> the most common.\n\n So it\'s a good mix.\n\n Therefore, my first guess will be ""RAISE"".I need to make an effective first guess for this Wordle-style game. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I gain from the feedback. This means prioritizing common letters in English 5-letter words.\n\nAfter analyzing letter frequency:\n- Vowels like A, E, I, O are common\n- Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are frequent\n- Ideally, the word should include several high-frequency letters\n\nWords like ""RAISE"" work well because:\n- It contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)\n- Uses 5 distinct letters to maximize coverage\n- R, A, I, S, E are all top-10 frequent letters in English  \n\nAlternative starters like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also strong, but ""RAISE"" has slight advantages:\n- Higher vowel density helps test frequent letter categories\n- Ending in E exploits a common word-ending pattern\n- Balanced letter distribution improves feedback clarity\n\nThis guess will efficiently reveal:\n- Which letters in {R, A, I, S, E} exist in the secret word\n- Which positions might be partially correct  \n- Vowel/consonant relationships to guide subsequent guesses\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on our first guess ""RAISE"":\n  R: x -> not present in the word\n  A: - -> present but in the wrong position\n  I: x -> not present\n  S: ✓ -> correct position (so S must be the fourth letter of the secret word)\n  E: x -> not present\n\nSo what we know:\n- The secret word has the letter **A**, but not in the second position (where we had A in RAISE). However, it could be in any position except 2? Actually, the feedback only says it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in positions 1, 3, 5? Remember that positions are fixed: \n    Position1: R -> not in word\n    Position2: A -> in word but not here\n    Position3: I -> not in word\n    Position4: S -> correct and in position\n    Position5: E -> not in word\n\n- Therefore, the secret word has:\n  - S at the fourth position? Wait: the fourth letter is S. Since we wrote RAISE: \n      R (pos1), A (pos2), I (pos3), S (pos4), E (pos5)\n  So the fourth letter of the secret word is S.\n\n- The letter A must appear somewhere else: so positions 1, 3, or 5? But note: position5 is not available because we also know E is not present and also note:\n  We know that position1 cannot be A? Actually, we cannot be certain until we test. But we know A is not in position2. \n\nHowever, we also know:\n- R is not in the word at all? So any position? So we must avoid R in the rest of the word.\n- Similarly, I and E are absent.\n\nTherefore, the secret word:\n- Contains the letter A (but not at position 2) and S (at position 4)\n- Does not contain R, I, E.\n\nSince we have S fixed at position4, we can now make a new guess.\n\nWe must also consider:\n- The word must have 5 letters, and we know two: the fourth is S, and A is present somewhere else (positions 1,3,5?).\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 3, or 5? But position5 is last, which is common for vowels? But wait, A can be at the beginning or middle.\n\nMoreover, we have to pick a word that excludes R, I, E.\n\nCommon English words with S in the fourth position and containing A.\n\nLooking for patterns: we can represent the word as: _ _ _ S _\n\nAnd A must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5? But note: also the second position is already excluded? And we may consider that A could be in the fifth? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut also remember: we have not set the rest of the letters. So we need to guess a word that:\n1. Has the fourth letter S.\n2. Contains the letter A (but not as the second letter? But actually the feedback said A is in the wrong position, meaning specifically that it is not in position2? But in the new word, we can put A anywhere except that we know it\'s not in position2? Actually, we are guessing another word so we can put A wherever we want? But the feedback tells us that in the secret word, A is in a different position than the second.\n\nBut importantly, we should avoid using R, I, E anywhere.\n\nNow, we can choose a word that has A in either position1, 3, or 5? And also we know the fourth is S.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters to get more information. In particular, common consonants and vowels.\n\nWhat letters can we use? We can try to include other common letters that are not excluded: so avoid R, I, E. Common letters: O, T, L, N, etc.\n\nIdea: try to put A in position1? Or position3? Or position5? Probably we should test a few possibilities? And also include new letters.\n\nLet me think of words with S in the fourth position? For example:\n- The word ends with S? But here is in the fourth position? So the fifth letter can be something else.\n\nPattern: __ __ __ S __\n\nSo the last letter is the fifth.\n\nWords ending with ""S_"" are not common? Actually, no: the word has five letters? So the fifth is one character.\n\nExamples of words that have S in the fourth position? \n  GLASS -> G L A S S? Wait: this has five letters: positions? \n      G1, L2, A3, S4, S5? But that\'s five letters. Then S is the fourth letter? Yes.\n\nBut in GLASS: \n  Letters: G, L, A, S, S? Then S is the fourth letter? And then the fifth letter is also S? So two S\'s? But our feedback didn\'t say anything about duplicate letters? So it\'s possible.\n\nBut we know that A is present: in GLASS, A is at position3.\n\nBut note: we have feedback that A is not at position2? Which is true? But wait, the word could have duplicate letters? But our first guess RAISE didn\'t have duplicates? So maybe duplicates are allowed?\n\nNow let\'s see the feedback: we had RAISE -> A was marked as \'-\' meaning present: so the secret word must have at least one A. In GLASS, it has A? Yes. But also note: GLASS has two S: but we have S at position4 being ✓, so if we guess GLASS and the secret word has an S at position4? Then at position5? Let me check.\n\nActually, our feedback indicated that only S was fixed? So we need to see how the game handles duplicates? The rules don\'t clarify? But typically:\n\nAssume standard Wordle rules: if there is one S in the secret word but two S in the guess, then one might get marked as green and the other as yellow? Or if the secret word has two, then both might get yellow/green accordingly.\n\nBut in our case, we have S at position4: ✓. And then if there\'s another S? Then we don\'t know until we see.\n\nBut since we don\'t have information about duplicate S? We are not forbidden? But also note: we didn\'t see an extra S? Because in RAISE, we only had one S? So if the secret word had an extra S? Then our RAISE wouldn\'t have shown in feedback? Actually, the feedback would only show what exists.\n\nFor example, if the secret word is GLASS? Then it has S at position4 and also position5. Then for RAISE:\n\n  RAISE: \n    R -> not in GLASS? So x (correct)\n    A -> in GLASS? At position3 -> so present: wait, we would get marked by \'-\'? And it was: A is \'-\'? Because it\'s present? But not at position2? So feedback: R(x) A(-) ... \n    I -> not present: so x? Correct.\n    S -> at position4: RAISE has S at position4? Secret word has S at position4? So ✓? Correct. \n    E -> not present? In GLASS? So E: x? Correct.\n\nBut note: in GLASS, it has an extra S? But our RAISE has only one S? Then the feedback wouldn\'t mark the fifth S? So we don\'t know? Therefore, we might need to consider duplicate letters.\n\nBut for this guess, we can pick a word that doesn\'t have duplicates? Or do we? Actually not necessary.\n\nI\'ll try to pick a word with S at position4? And containing A? And avoiding R, I, E? And also we want to test other common letters? Like O, T, L, N, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\nLet me consider: \n  A: at position1? words like: A _ _ S _ \n      Examples: ANSWERS? More than 5 letters? \n      5-letter words: ANTSY? ANTSY: A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5? So S is at position4? Good. Also: ANTSY has A at 1? And contains T, N, Y? And avoids R, I, E? Then let\'s consider:\n\nBut note: in ANTSY, the A is at position1? This would be a good candidate? Then we can check:\n  If the secret word has A at position1? Then we would expect a ✓? Or if it is elsewhere? \n  Also, we can test N, T, S? Note S is already at position4? So it\'s known? \n\nAlternatively: put A at position5: then pattern: _ _ _ S A? Words? Like? \n  CONGA? CONGA: C1 O2 N3 G4 A5? Wait: position4 is G? We need position4 to be S? So that doesn\'t work.\n\nOr words with A in the middle: position3? Pattern: _ _ A S _ \n  Words: CLASS? CLASS: C1 L2 A3 S4 S5? But has two S? So CLASS? \n      CLASS has S at position4? And A at position3? And letters C, L, S? Also avoids R, I, E? Then yes.\n\nBut wait: CLASS has two S? Then if the secret word has only one S? That might cause feedback issue? But let\'s see: if the secret word has exactly one S at position4, then in CLASS guess:\n  C: ? \n  L: ?\n  A: ✓? If A is at position3? \n  First S: position4? ✓\n  Second S: position5? then should be marked as \'x\'? Because there is no second S? \n\nActually, the feedback rules: \n  If the secret word has a letter only once, and you guess two, then the first occurrence of the letter (in the guess) that can be matched will get a ✓ or -, and the redundant one will be marked as x? Typically? \n\nBut the rules says: \n  ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols""\n\nAnd the symbols are assigned independently? But actually, the standard Wordle method is: \n\n  First check for exact matches? Then mark those letters? Then check the remaining for misplaced.\n\nTherefore: \n  Consider secret word: GLASS? \n    Guess: CLASS? \n      Positions: \n        Position4: S? Secret has S at position4? → S4 ✓? \n        Then for the fifth S? The secret has another S? So that S is also present? But then we have to mark it? But wait, the secret has two S? And the guess has two S? And the first one at position4 is already matched? So the fifth position: S? matches? But wait: the secret has S at position4 and also at position5? So the guess fifth S? Then it would be matched? So ✓? \n\n  Alternatively: secret word was something else? Only one S? Then CLASS:\n        Position4: S (secret has S at position4) → ✓\n        Position5: S (secret has only one S? Then already matched? Therefore, no S left → x? \n\nBut since we haven\'t seen the secret word? Let me not overcomplicate.\n\nBut note: we know from the feedback that A is present? But we don\'t know if it appears once or more? Similarly, the secret word may have duplicate letters? So we have to be careful.\n\nGiven that, I will try to find words that avoid duplicate letters? To make feedback cleaner? Or accept that duplicates are possible.\n\nBut in our next guess, we can avoid using duplicate letters? Because we want maximum information? \n\nSo let me avoid duplicates? So the word has exactly five distinct letters? But we have to? Not required? But for guessing, using distinct letters can help get information for other letters? \n\nNow: our constraints:\n  Position4: must be S? \n  The word must contain A? (exactly one? we don\'t know? but at least one) and avoid R, I, E? \n  We can test other letters? \n\nExample words:\n  ANTSY? I think ANTSY is a valid word? (antsy: nervous)\n\nANTSY: \n  Positions:\n    1: A? Then we test A: which could be ✓ if the secret word has A at start? Or \'-\' if elsewhere? Or if duplicate? \n  We also test N, T, S? But S is at position4? fixed? \n  Letters: A, N, T, S, Y? Distinct? and avoid R,I,E? \n\nAlso consider words like:\n  CAMPS? CAMPS: C1, A2, M3, P4, S5? Oh wait: position4 is P? But we need position4 to be S? \n\nAlso: GASSY? G1 A2 S3 S4 Y5? Has duplicate S? So position4 is S? Good? But then A is at position2? But we cannot put A at position2? Because in our first guess, A was at position2? And it\'s marked as \'-\' meaning not here? But wait: that was for the word RAISE? Now we are guessing GASSY? \n\nImportant: the feedback on the first guess told us that A is not in position2? So in the secret word, A is in a position other than 2? \n\nTherefore, in our next guess? We must not put A at position2? Because we know it\'s not!? Exactly? \n\nSo if we put A at position2 in our guess? Then what? \n  In GASSY: A at position2? Then the secret word? If the secret word has A at position2? Why was it marked as \'-\'? That is confusing? \n\nWe must be careful: the first guess\'s feedback: A was marked as \'-\' meaning that the letter A exists in the word? But not in position2? So we know that in the secret word, position2 is NOT A? \n\nTherefore, if we put A at position2 in a new guess? Then we will definitely get a \'-\' (if the secret word actually has A?)?\n\nBut wait: if the secret word has A at position2? Then it would have been ✓? But it wasn\'t? So we know position2 is not A? So for GASSY? We are putting A at position2? Then the feedback would be: \'-\'? But we already know it\'s not at position2? So we don\'t gain new information? Worse, we are wasting a slot? So we should avoid putting A at position2? \n\nMoreover, we know it\'s not at position2? So any guess should place A elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, in GASSY? it\'s invalid? Because we are putting A at position2? Then the feedback will say: yes, A is in the word? But not at position2? But we already know? So what\'s the point? We should put A somewhere else? Maybe to test another position? \n\nActually, we can put A at position2? to test? But no? because we know it\'s not? So we are sure? So putting A at position2? Then we will get a \'-\'? But we know? So no new information? \n\nSo we should avoid? \n\nTherefore, avoid using A at position2? in any guess? \n\nSo let me find words with:\n  Pattern: _ _ _ S ? \n  Must include A? but not at position2? \n  Avoid R, I, E? \n  And using other common letters? \n\nOptions:\n  Position1: A? Then words like: A _ _ S _ ? \n      Example: ANTSY? \n      Also: ABYSS? has a lot of S? so duplicate? \n             ABYSS: A1,B2,Y3,S4,S5? Duplicate S? \n  Position3: A? Then words: _ _ A S ? \n      Example: CHASM? CHASM: C1 H2 A3 S4 M5? \n      Also: CLASP? but more than 5? \n\n  Position5: A? Then words: _ _ _ S A? \n      Examples: MANSA? but obscure? \n      Words: There are words? LAMPS? but position4: P? \n         How about PATHS? PATHS: P1 A2 T3 H4 S5? Now S is at position5? We need position4? \n         Not working? \n         Words ending with SA? Like MANSA? Or VISTA? VISTA: V1 I2 S3 T4 A5? Then S at position3? \n\nConclusion: \n  Positions for A: 1 or 3? Because we cannot use position2? and position5 might be difficult? \n\nLet me consider: \n  ANTSY: A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5? \n      This contains A at start? So test position1? Also N at position2? T at position3? Avoids R,I,E? \n\nBut wait: we also know that position2? In ANTSY: we are using N at position2? What if the secret word has A at position2? No? We know it doesn\'t? So no conflict? But we are using N? which is new? \n\nAlso: CHASM? C1, H2, A3, S4, M5? \n      Then A at position3? We are testing? \n\nWhich word is better? \n\nWe also need to cover more letters? So ANTSY: tests A, N, T, Y? \nCHASM: tests C, H, A, M? \n\nBoth are valid words? \n\nNow: common letters? \n  N and T are more common than C, H, M? So ANTSY might cover more common letters? \n\nLet me see the frequencies:\n\n  Letter frequencies (from high to low): \n    E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, Y, F, V, K, W, Z, X, J, Q\n\nSo A: high? Now we are testing A? But we know A exists? so we don\'t need to confirm existence? Instead, we want to pin down the position? \n\nBut also we test other letters? \n\nFor ANTSY: \n  Letters: A (already known? but we want to test its position?), N, T, S (known? already ✓ at position4? so only position4 must be S? In our guess we set S at position4? which should always be? so it will be ✓ again? \n\nTherefore, guess ANTSY: \n  Positions:\n    1: A? → if the secret word has A at position1? then ✓? otherwise, if elsewhere? then \'-\'? \n    2: N? → new letter? \n    3: T? → new letter? \n    4: S? → we already know? ✓? \n    5: Y? → new letter? \n\nSimilarly for CHASM: \n  1: C → if present? \n  2: H → ? \n  3: A? → if secret word has A at position3? then ✓? \n  4: S? → ✓? \n  5: M → new? \n\nBetween ANTSY and CHASM? The commonality: \n  ANTSY tests A at 1? and N, T, Y? \n  CHASM tests A at 3? and C, H, M? \n\nWhich is better? \n\nWe know that A is in the word? But we don\'t know the position? So we can test position1? if we get ✓? Then we know!? If not? Then it must be position3? or 5? But wait, are there other positions? We excluded position2? and we haven\'t tested position5? but we said position5 words are hard? \n\nIn our constraints? Pattern: _ _ _ S _? So the first three letters? or fifth? \n\nAlso, we might have words where A is at position5? But we need S in the fourth? \n\nLet me find: are there words with A at position5? and S at position4? \n  Words ending with SA? Actually, most English words with S at fourth? Then fifth? Not necessarily? \n\nExamples: \n  QUASI? QUASI: Q1 U2 A3 S4 I5? But I5? We cannot use I? Because we know I is not present? So invalid? \n  Also: TANSY? TANSY: T1 A2 N3 S4 Y5? Wait: A at position2? But we cannot use A at position2? So invalid? \n  MANAS? MANAS: M1 A2 N3 A4 S5? A2? invalid? \n\nHow about words like: VASAL? VASAL: V1 A2 S3 A4 L5? A2? invalid? \n\nSo I think: position5? There are words? LAMSA? Not a word? \n\nSo we are left with position1 or position3 for A? \n\nNow: should we guess A at position1? or position3? \n\nBy guessing A at position1? we can test it? And if it\'s ✓? Then we know? And if not? Then we know it must be position3 or higher? Later? \n\nSimilarly? By guessing A at position3? we can test? \n\nBut note: if we guess A at position1? and we get ✓? Then we know the first letter? And also S at the fourth? Then we can ignore position3? But wait: position3? We don\'t know? \n\nBut also? if we get A at position1 ✓? Then we have two letters? and we know the rest must be letters not R,I,E? \n\nAlternatively? if we guess CHASM? A at position3? and it turns out A is actually at position3? Then we know first letter? Also?\n\nBut if we guess A at position1? and A is actually at position3? Then it will be marked as \'-\'? Meaning present? but not here? Which we already know? So no new information? Except that it is not at position1? Then we know it must be position3? \n\nSo: \n\n  Option1: guess ANTSY?\n    If A is at position1? then we get ✓ for A? and then we know: word begins with A? and then _ , _ , S? and the fifth letter? Also? \n    If not? Then A gets \'-\'? and then we know A must be at position3? Because we\'ve avoided position2? and we can\'t have it at position4? which is S? \n\nBut wait: the secret word: \n  position4 is S? \n  The letter A? cannot be at position2? and if it\'s at position4? Then A=S? That can\'t be? So A must be either position1 or position3 or position5? But we couldn\'t find words for position5? Which leaves? position1 and 3? \n\nTherefore, if we guess ANTSY? \n  Possible outcomes:\n    If A is at position1? then ✓? \n    If A is at position3? then at our guess position1? A → we get \'-\'? \n    If A is at position5? which is very rare? then we get \'-\'? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested position5 so far? \n\nAlternatively? Guess a word that tests two positions? But we have limited choices? Let me try to think: \n\nWord: PLAYS? Has S at position5? No? \n\nAnother idea: guess a word that puts A at position5? Even if we didn\'t find? We can create a word? But we must use English words. \n\nWhat about the word: MASSA? Not valid? \n\nWord: TASSA? No? \n\nWord: PASSA? Not common? Let me list? \n\nValid words: \n  MANAS? But not standard? and A at position2? invalid? \n  KANS? 4 letters? \n  There might be less common words? \n\nAnother possibility: YEAHS? But E? We cannot use E? \n\nSo probably? We cannot cover position5? Therefore? it\'s either 1 or 3? \n\nThus? ANTSY would test position1? \n\nBut? What about the word: CHASM? Which tests position3? \n\nGiven this? I prefer to cover? maybe test A at position3? Why? Because position1? We can test later? But note: we are at the second guess? and we have 6 tries? \n\nAlso? we can choose ANTSY? because it tests? more common letters? N, T, and Y? \n\nAlternatively? What is more efficient? \n\nWe can choose a word that covers? two possibilities? But it\'s hard? \n\nTherefore? I suggest? guessing? ANTSY? \n\nBut wait? let me see? ANTSY: if the secret word has A at position3? then our guess: ANTSY? \n  Position1: A? → not present? This secret word? Then we mark A: \n    If the secret word has A at position3? Then our A at position1? should get \'x\'? But wait: it would be marked as \'-\'? because A exists in the word? \n    Even though same letter? Because A exists? but not? at position1? Then we get \'-\'? \n\nBut wait: this confusion? \n\nActually? standard rules: \n  For ANTSY? against a secret word? say? at the secret word? A at position3: \n    Secret: _ _ A S _\n    Guess: ANTSY: \n      Position1: A? → the secret word? Does it have A at position1? No? but it has A? at position3? So this A in position1? should be marked as \'-\'? \n      Then position2: N? If the secret has letter at position2? We don\'t care? \n      Position3: T? if the secret has T? → but we don\'t know? \n      Position4: S? ✓? \n      Position5: Y? \n\nSo? We get? A at position1 marked as \'-\'? meaning? A exists? but not at position1? \n\nThen we know A? must be at? position3? or 5? \n\nBecause? we excluded position2? and position1? then? \n\nSimilarly? if the secret word had A at position5? then we also get \'-\' at A (position1) of ANTSY? \n\nBut how do we distinguish between A at position3 and A at position5? \n\nThat\'s a problem? \n\nAfter ANTSY? if A at position1? marked as? then ✓? or if not? then \'-\'? meaning A exists? not at position1? However? then we still have ambiguity? \n\nTo avoid that? we can choose a word that has A at position3? so we test directly position3? \n\nTherefore? CHASM? might be better? \n\nCHASM: \n  Positions: \n    1: C? new? \n    2: H? new? \n    3: A? Then feedback: \n        If the secret has A at position3? then ✓? \n        If it has A? elsewhere (position1 or 5)? Then \'-\'? \n    4: S? ✓? \n    5: M? new? \n\nBut if the secret has A at position1? Then CHASM:\n  Position1: C? compared to A? → not match? but secret has A at position1? which is not in our guess\'s letter1? But wait? our guess\'s letter1 is C? Then? \n        C? should be checked: not present? → x? \n        Then? A? at position3? even if? the secret has a A? at position3? But wait? it also has one at position1? Then we have:\n\n        Secret: A? _ _ S _? and at position3? we don\'t know? \n\n        But: the secret has A? and our guess has A at position3? Then if the secret has A at position3? then it\'s ✓? Otherwise? \'-\'? \n\n        If the secret has A at position1 and also position3? Then we would get: \n          C: x (because not in? or if A is duplicated? then: \n          We would have A in guess at position3? matched to A at position3? then ✓? \n          And the A at position1 of secret? not matched? \n\n        If the secret has A only at position1? then our A at position3? is not at the correct position? but present? so \'-\'? \n\n        So the feedback would show: \n          Position1: x? \n          Position3: ✓? if A at position3? Or \'-\'? if A exists? but not at position3? \n\nBut the secret cannot have both A at position1 and position3? Because we already know that A is present? we don\'t know about multiplicities? \n\nBut? importantly? by not testing position1? we can miss? \n\nHowever? Given that we can only test one position at a time? \n\nSo I propose CHASM? which tests A at position3? \n\nThen after the feedback? we will know:\n  For A?:\n    If we get ✓ at position3? then we know A? is at position3? \n    If we get \'-\'? Which would be at position3? then? that means A is not at position3? but present? then we know A must be at position1? or position5? \n    If we get x? Cannot? Then we know nothing? \n\nBut wait: no? We know A exists? So in CHASM? \n  If the secret word has A at position3? then ✓? \n  If the secret word has A but not at position3? then \'-\'? \n\nSince position3 must be matched? \n\nTherefore? I think CHASM? is better? \n\nAlternatively? if we use a word that has A at position1 and also includes? a common letter at position5? But no? \n\nTherefore? I choose CHASM? \n\nSo let\'s go with CHASM?After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":  \n- **R, I, E are eliminated** since they are marked as absent (x).  \n- **S is fixed at position 4** (✓) in the secret word.  \n- **A is present but not in position 2** (-), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  \n\nGiven the constraints and common English words:  \n- The secret word must fit the pattern `_ _ _ S _`, containing the letter A (not in position 2).  \n- Letters R, I, E are excluded.  \n\nFor this second guess:  \n- **Testing position 3 for A** helps narrow down its location efficiently.  \n- **CHASM (C1 H2 A3 S4 M5)** is chosen because:  \n  - It tests A in position 3 (to resolve ambiguity).  \n  - Includes new common letters (C, H, M) to probe the word structure.  \n  - Avoids eliminated letters (R, I, E) and the forbidden position 2 for A.  \n- If A is in position 3, we get direct confirmation; otherwise, the feedback (- or ✓) will clarify A\'s true position or reveal new letters.\n\n<guess>CHASM</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: CHASM -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(-) S(✓) M(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
This tells us:
- R is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not at position 2.
- I is not in the word.
- S is in the word and at position 4 (so the fourth letter is S).
- E is not in the word.

Guess 2: CHASM -> C(x) H(x) A(-) S(✓) M(x)
This tells us:
- C is not in the word.
- H is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not at position 3 (since in CHASM, A was at position 3 and we got '-' meaning present but wrong position? Actually, CHASM positions: C(1), H(2), A(3), S(4), M(5). So A at position 3 gets '-', meaning it is in the word but not at position 3.
- S at position 4 is still correct (✓).
- M is not in the word.

In summary:

Confirmed letters:
- Position 4 is S.

Present letters (but not at specific positions):
- A is present, but not at position 2 (from RAISE) and not at position 3 (from CHASM).

Absent letters: R, I, E, C, H, M.

Also note: We know the word has A and it must be at position 1 or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are now excluded, and position 4 is taken by S). So the word pattern is:
Position 1: could be A or another letter? But we know A must be in one of the positions 1 or 5? Actually, the positions: 1, 5, or possibly multiple? But given that we only have two guesses, we haven't tested position 5 for A? So A must appear in either position 1 or position 5? Or could it be duplicated? But we haven't seen duplicates? However, possible.

But note: if A were at position 5, then from RAISE (which had A at position 2) we got '-', meaning A is present? Same for CHASM? So if the word has A at position 1 and position 5? It's possible? But that's not necessary? We only know at least one A? and that it is not at 2 or 3.

So possible locations for A: 1 or 5.

Also, we know the word must contain exactly the letters: A, S, and three others? which are not R,I,E,C,H,M? And S at position 4.

So we need to form a 5-letter word: 
Pattern: _ _ _ S _ 
where one of the blanks (position 1 or 5) is A? or both? But we don't know? So we must guess a word that tests these? 

Now, we want to use new letters? We have eliminated R,I,E,C,H,M? So available letters: common ones like O, T, L, N, U, D, P, etc.

Given that A must be at position 1 or 5? What words exist? 

Option 1: A at position 1? Then word: A _ _ S _ 
Option 2: A at position 5? Then word: _ _ _ S A

There is also the possibility? that A is at position 1 and we have a letter at position 5? Or A at position 5 and we have a letter at position 1? 

Now, we should choose a word that tests? Where we put A? If we put A at one of them? then the feedback will tell? 

But note: if A is not at the position we guess? we get '-'? but we know? Or if we get ✓? then it's there? 

I think we need to choose a word that covers one scenario? 

For instance? let's assume if we put A at position 1? then:
  If the secret word has A at position 1? we get ✓? Then we know? And if not? we get '-'? meaning it must be at position 5? 

Similarly? if we put A at position 5? 
  If ✓? then A at 5? 
  If '-'? then A must be at position 1? 

So there's no harm? and we can use? that? 

But we can then pick a word that tests? multiple letters? 

So let's try to find words: 

Case 1: Word with A at position 1? Pattern: A _ _ S _ 
  Examples: ANTSY? But we already tried ANTSY? No? We didn't? We considered? ANTSY: A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5? that works? And avoids eliminated letters? 

Case 2: Word with A at position 5? Pattern: _ _ _ S A? 
  Words: MANSA? Not common? 
  Words: AROSA? Not English? 
  Words: VISTA? VISTA? Positions: V1? I2? S3? T4? A5? But I2: I is eliminated? So invalid? 
  Words: PATSA? Not a word? 
  Words: SATSA? No? 
  Words: LATSA? No? 
  Words: DATSA? No? 
  Words: HATSA? No? 
  Words: JATS? 4 letters? 
  Words: Yacks? But E? 
  Conclusion: it is hard to find English words that end with SA and are 5 letters? that do not contain the eliminated letters? We exclude R,I,E,C,H,M? 

Therefore? we choose ANTSY? 

ANTSY: 
  It has A at position 1? 
  Letters: A, N, T, S, Y? which are allowed? 

But wait? ANTSY: 
  We haven't tested N, T, Y? 

Feedback will tell us? 
  If A is at position 1? then ✓? 
  If not? we get '-'? meaning A exists? but not here? but we already know? So no new information? And then? the other positions? 

But if we get A at position 1: ✓? Then we know? 
  The word: A _ _ S _ 
  and then from ANTSY? we get? 
  Position 2: N? new? 
  Position 3: T? new? 
  Position 5: Y? new? 

And then? we have to deduce? 

But if A is not at position 1? then in ANTSY? 
  Position 1: A? will be '-'? meaning? A is present? but not here? then we know? A must be at position 5? 

So? we gain information? 

Therefore? I think ANTSY? is the next best guess? 

Alternatively? we can design? to test both? 

But ANTSY: we are testing position 1: A? And if accepted? then we know? And if not? we know A is at position 5? 

Also? we test new letters? 

But note: the letter S? at position4? we already know? so ✓? 

Potential drawback: 
  If the word has A at position 5? and we guess ANTSY? which has A at position 1? and gets '-'? Then we know A should be at position 5? Then the word pattern? becomes: _ _ _ S A? 

Then we have to guess? And we have an extra try? 

But we have 4 tries left? 

So we go with ANTSY? 

After the feedback, we will know more? 

So: 

<guess>ANTSY</guess>

But let me think: 

Another candidate: what about PLANE? But for PLANE: P L A N E? 
But E is eliminated? so invalid? 

TOAST? O and A? But TOAST: T1 O2 A3 S4 T5? 
But S4? is correct? 
But A3: but we already tried A at position3? and got '-', meaning? not at position3? 
But here? we are putting A at position3? again? So feedback? It would be '-' again? 
But no new information? 
Also? does not test position1? 

Similarly? SALTS? S at position1? But word: S A L T S? 
But S is duplicated? 
Also? A at position2? excluded? because first feedback? So we know? position2 is not A? 
Therefore? SALTS: 
  Position1: S? but secret word: position4 is S? So if there's only one S? Then we might get? 
      Position1: S (duplicate? no? if only one S? then? This S? is not at position4? but we get '-'? because S occurs? 
      Then A: at position2? which? we know is not? so '-'? again? 
  And etc? 

So not optimized? 

Therefore? I stick with ANTSY? 

So guess: ANTSY
</think>
Based on the feedback from both guesses:
- **S is confirmed at position 4** (✓ from RAISE and CHASM).
- **A is present** but not at positions 2 (from RAISE) or 3 (from CHASM), leaving positions 1 or 5 as possible locations.
- **Eliminated letters**: R, I, E, C, H, M (marked x in previous feedback).

The secret word fits the pattern `_ _ _ S _`, with A in position 1 or 5. For the third guess:
- **ANTSY (A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5)** is chosen because:
  1. It tests A at position 1 to resolve its location:
     - If ✓, A is at position 1.
     - If -, A must be at position 5.
  2. Uses new high-frequency letters (N, T, Y) to probe unknown positions.
  3. Avoids eliminated letters and reuses S at its known position (✓ guaranteed).
  4. Maximizes information gain by clarifying A’s position while testing three new letters.

<guess>ANTSY</guess>",ANTSY,"We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
This tells us:
- R is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not at position 2.
- I is not in the word.
- S is in the word and at position 4 (so the fourth letter is S).
- E is not in the word.

Guess 2: CHASM -> C(x) H(x) A(-) S(✓) M(x)
This tells us:
- C is not in the word.
- H is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not at position 3 (since in CHASM, A was at position 3 and we got '-' meaning present but wrong position? Actually, CHASM positions: C(1), H(2), A(3), S(4), M(5). So A at position 3 gets '-', meaning it is in the word but not at position 3.
- S at position 4 is still correct (✓).
- M is not in the word.

In summary:

Confirmed letters:
- Position 4 is S.

Present letters (but not at specific positions):
- A is present, but not at position 2 (from RAISE) and not at position 3 (from CHASM).

Absent letters: R, I, E, C, H, M.

Also note: We know the word has A and it must be at position 1 or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are now excluded, and position 4 is taken by S). So the word pattern is:
Position 1: could be A or another letter? But we know A must be in one of the positions 1 or 5? Actually, the positions: 1, 5, or possibly multiple? But given that we only have two guesses, we haven't tested position 5 for A? So A must appear in either position 1 or position 5? Or could it be duplicated? But we haven't seen duplicates? However, possible.

But note: if A were at position 5, then from RAISE (which had A at position 2) we got '-', meaning A is present? Same for CHASM? So if the word has A at position 1 and position 5? It's possible? But that's not necessary? We only know at least one A? and that it is not at 2 or 3.

So possible locations for A: 1 or 5.

Also, we know the word must contain exactly the letters: A, S, and three others? which are not R,I,E,C,H,M? And S at position 4.

So we need to form a 5-letter word: 
Pattern: _ _ _ S _ 
where one of the blanks (position 1 or 5) is A? or both? But we don't know? So we must guess a word that tests these? 

Now, we want to use new letters? We have eliminated R,I,E,C,H,M? So available letters: common ones like O, T, L, N, U, D, P, etc.

Given that A must be at position 1 or 5? What words exist? 

Option 1: A at position 1? Then word: A _ _ S _ 
Option 2: A at position 5? Then word: _ _ _ S A

There is also the possibility? that A is at position 1 and we have a letter at position 5? Or A at position 5 and we have a letter at position 1? 

Now, we should choose a word that tests? Where we put A? If we put A at one of them? then the feedback will tell? 

But note: if A is not at the position we guess? we get '-'? but we know? Or if we get ✓? then it's there? 

I think we need to choose a word that covers one scenario?

Similarly? if we put A at position 5? 
  If ✓? then A at 5? 
  If '-'? then A must be at position 1? 

So there's no harm? and we can use? that? 

But we can then pick a word that tests? multiple letters?

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,abyss,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since we have no prior information, we want a starting word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L, etc.).
 One popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"", but let me think also about maximizing information.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. are good. But note we are allowed 6 tries.

 Considering the feedback for the first guess is crucial because it sets the stage.

 I will choose ""SLATE"". Why?
 - It has two of the most common vowels: A and E.
 - It uses common consonants: S, L, T.

 But note: we are not told any constraints and must produce a valid English word.

 Let me confirm ""SLATE"" is a word: yes, it means a thin piece of rock or a list of candidates.

 However, let me think about another popular one: ""RAISE"" is also good because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 However, in the instructions, the example used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We are free to choose.

 But note: the feedback symbols:
   ✓ : correct letter and correct position
   - : letter in word but wrong position
   x : letter not in word

 We want to maximize the information we get on the first try. That is, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 According to some analyses, the letters that appear most frequently in English 5-letter words are (in order): E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, ... 

 So words like ""LATER"" or ""ALTER"" are good? But let's see:

 I think ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because it uses three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S) that are very common.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word? Actually, ROATE is a valid word meaning an amount of revenue collected. But it is obscure.

 Another candidate is ""CRANE"". It uses C, R, A, N, E. That's also good.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: SLATE -> S, L, A, T, E
 Option 2: RAISE -> R, A, I, S, E
 Option 3: CRANE -> C, R, A, N, E

 Which has the highest probability of containing letters in the secret word?

 Since I'm not sure, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:

 - It has three vowels: A, E and two consonants C, R, N (N is common too).
 - C and R are among the top consonants.

 Alternatively, note that the letter E is the most common vowel and the most common letter. So having E at the end is good.

 Decision: I'll start with ""CRANE"".

 But wait: in the example, the secret word was ""BRISK"". If I guessed ""CRANE"":
   C is in ""BRISK""? No -> then x
   R is in ""BRISK""? Yes -> but in position 2? In BRISK, R is at position 2, so that would be ✓? But wait, the secret word is BRISK and CRANE: 
        C vs B -> not same -> so C: x
        R vs R -> same -> R: ✓
        A vs I -> different -> A: is A in BRISK? No -> x
        N vs S -> different -> N: not in BRISK -> x
        E vs K -> different -> E: not in BRISK -> x
   So we get R in the correct position and the rest x.

 That gives us one letter and position, but we don't get information on other letters being present.

 Alternatively, if I choose a word with letters that are more common? Let's try ""SLATE"" on BRISK:

   S: BRISK has S? Yes -> position? S is at position 1? Guess has S at position 1? Secret word: position 4 is S (if we count 1-indexed: B=1, R=2, I=3, S=4, K=5). So guess letter in position1: S -> secret position4: S -> so this is wrong position -> then '-' 
   L: in BRISK? -> No -> x
   A: No -> x
   T: No -> x
   E: No -> x

 Then we get one '-' and four x's. So we know S is present but in the wrong position.

 So which gives more information? In both cases we got one valuable piece. But with ""CRANE"", we know R is in position2 and that's fixed. With ""SLATE"" we know S is present but not in position1 -> then it must be in positions 2,3,4, or5.

 But note: we can get more than one letter? That depends on the secret word.

 Another candidate: ""ROAST"" -> let's try on BRISK:
   R: position1 vs position2 of secret -> not same -> but present -> '-'
   O: not present -> x
   A: not present -> x
   S: BRISK has S at position4 -> guess has S at position3? -> so no -> present -> '-'
   T: not present -> x

 Then we get two '-' and three x. We know R and S are present but not in position1 and position3 respectively.

 How about ""RAISE"" on BRISK?
   R: present -> compare position? position1 of guess vs secret: R at position1? secret has R at position2 -> so wrong -> '-'
   A: not present -> x
   I: BRISK has I at position3 -> guess has at position2? -> so wrong -> '-'
   S: present -> at position4? guess has at position4? -> no, at position3? guess position3: I -> then S is at position4? In guess, S is at position4? But secret has S at position4? 
        Actually: 
        Guess: R (1), A(2), I(3), S(4), E(5)
        Secret: B(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), K(5)
        So:
          R: wrong position -> '-'
          A: x
          I: position matches? guess position3 and secret position3 -> same -> ✓
          S: position4? also same -> ✓
          E: x
        So the feedback would be: R(-), A(x), I(✓), S(✓), E(x)

 Then we get two ✓ and one '-'. That's great.

 Therefore, ""RAISE"" seems to have the potential for more hits? But note that we are showing an example where it works well for BRISK.

 However, we don't know the secret word. Therefore, we need a word that gives maximum information in the average case.

 According to some sources, the starting words that are optimal include CRANE, SALET, ROATE, SOARE, etc.

 However, I remember that ""RAISE"" is one of the top starting words because it uses R, A, I, S, E which are among the top 10 most common letters.

 So I will go with ""RAISE"".

 Let me double-check: 
   R is the 3rd most common letter (in the top list I recalled: E, A, R, ...) -> so R is very common.
   A is the 2nd most common.
   I is a common vowel -> 7th?
   S is 8th?
   E -> the most common.

 So it's a good mix.

 Therefore, my first guess will be ""RAISE"".I need to make an effective first guess for this Wordle-style game. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I gain from the feedback. This means prioritizing common letters in English 5-letter words.

After analyzing letter frequency:
- Vowels like A, E, I, O are common
- Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are frequent
- Ideally, the word should include several high-frequency letters

Words like ""RAISE"" work well because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- Uses 5 distinct letters to maximize coverage
- R, A, I, S, E are all top-10 frequent letters in English  

Alternative starters like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also strong, but ""RAISE"" has slight advantages:
- Higher vowel density helps test frequent letter categories
- Ending in E exploits a common word-ending pattern
- Balanced letter distribution improves feedback clarity

This guess will efficiently reveal:
- Which letters in {R, A, I, S, E} exist in the secret word
- Which positions might be partially correct  
- Vowel/consonant relationships to guide subsequent guesses

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on our first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x -> not present in the word
  A: - -> present but in the wrong position
  I: x -> not present
  S: ✓ -> correct position (so S must be the fourth letter of the secret word)
  E: x -> not present

So what we know:
- The secret word has the letter **A**, but not in the second position (where we had A in RAISE). However, it could be in any position except 2? Actually, the feedback only says it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in positions 1, 3, 5? Remember that positions are fixed: 
    Position1: R -> not in word
    Position2: A -> in word but not here
    Position3: I -> not in word
    Position4: S -> correct and in position
    Position5: E -> not in word

- Therefore, the secret word has:
  - S at the fourth position? Wait: the fourth letter is S. Since we wrote RAISE: 
      R (pos1), A (pos2), I (pos3), S (pos4), E (pos5)
  So the fourth letter of the secret word is S.

- The letter A must appear somewhere else: so positions 1, 3, or 5? But note: position5 is not available because we also know E is not present and also note:
  We know that position1 cannot be A? Actually, we cannot be certain until we test. But we know A is not in position2. 

However, we also know:
- R is not in the word at all? So any position? So we must avoid R in the rest of the word.
- Similarly, I and E are absent.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains the letter A (but not at position 2) and S (at position 4)
- Does not contain R, I, E.

Since we have S fixed at position4, we can now make a new guess.

We must also consider:
- The word must have 5 letters, and we know two: the fourth is S, and A is present somewhere else (positions 1,3,5?).

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, or 5? But position5 is last, which is common for vowels? But wait, A can be at the beginning or middle.

Moreover, we have to pick a word that excludes R, I, E.

Common English words with S in the fourth position and containing A.

Looking for patterns: we can represent the word as: _ _ _ S _

And A must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5? But note: also the second position is already excluded? And we may consider that A could be in the fifth? But we don't know.

But also remember: we have not set the rest of the letters. So we need to guess a word that:
1. Has the fourth letter S.
2. Contains the letter A (but not as the second letter? But actually the feedback said A is in the wrong position, meaning specifically that it is not in position2? But in the new word, we can put A anywhere except that we know it's not in position2? Actually, we are guessing another word so we can put A wherever we want? But the feedback tells us that in the secret word, A is in a different position than the second.

But importantly, we should avoid using R, I, E anywhere.

Now, we can choose a word that has A in either position1, 3, or 5? And also we know the fourth is S.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information. In particular, common consonants and vowels.

What letters can we use? We can try to include other common letters that are not excluded: so avoid R, I, E. Common letters: O, T, L, N, etc.

Idea: try to put A in position1? Or position3? Or position5? Probably we should test a few possibilities? And also include new letters.

Let me think of words with S in the fourth position? For example:
- The word ends with S? But here is in the fourth position? So the fifth letter can be something else.

Pattern: __ __ __ S __

So the last letter is the fifth.

Words ending with ""S_"" are not common? Actually, no: the word has five letters? So the fifth is one character.

Examples of words that have S in the fourth position? 
  GLASS -> G L A S S? Wait: this has five letters: positions? 
      G1, L2, A3, S4, S5? But that's five letters. Then S is the fourth letter? Yes.

But in GLASS: 
  Letters: G, L, A, S, S? Then S is the fourth letter? And then the fifth letter is also S? So two S's? But our feedback didn't say anything about duplicate letters? So it's possible.

But we know that A is present: in GLASS, A is at position3.

But note: we have feedback that A is not at position2? Which is true? But wait, the word could have duplicate letters? But our first guess RAISE didn't have duplicates? So maybe duplicates are allowed?

Now let's see the feedback: we had RAISE -> A was marked as '-' meaning present: so the secret word must have at least one A. In GLASS, it has A? Yes. But also note: GLASS has two S: but we have S at position4 being ✓, so if we guess GLASS and the secret word has an S at position4? Then at position5? Let me check.

Actually, our feedback indicated that only S was fixed? So we need to see how the game handles duplicates? The rules don't clarify? But typically:

Assume standard Wordle rules: if there is one S in the secret word but two S in the guess, then one might get marked as green and the other as yellow? Or if the secret word has two, then both might get yellow/green accordingly.

But in our case, we have S at position4: ✓. And then if there's another S? Then we don't know until we see.

But since we don't have information about duplicate S? We are not forbidden? But also note: we didn't see an extra S? Because in RAISE, we only had one S? So if the secret word had an extra S? Then our RAISE wouldn't have shown in feedback? Actually, the feedback would only show what exists.

For example, if the secret word is GLASS? Then it has S at position4 and also position5. Then for RAISE:

  RAISE: 
    R -> not in GLASS? So x (correct)
    A -> in GLASS? At position3 -> so present: wait, we would get marked by '-'? And it was: A is '-'? Because it's present? But not at position2? So feedback: R(x) A(-) ... 
    I -> not present: so x? Correct.
    S -> at position4: RAISE has S at position4? Secret word has S at position4? So ✓? Correct. 
    E -> not present? In GLASS? So E: x? Correct.

But note: in GLASS, it has an extra S? But our RAISE has only one S? Then the feedback wouldn't mark the fifth S? So we don't know? Therefore, we might need to consider duplicate letters.

But for this guess, we can pick a word that doesn't have duplicates? Or do we? Actually not necessary.

I'll try to pick a word with S at position4? And containing A? And avoiding R, I, E? And also we want to test other common letters? Like O, T, L, N, etc.

Possible words:

Let me consider: 
  A: at position1? words like: A _ _ S _ 
      Examples: ANSWERS? More than 5 letters? 
      5-letter words: ANTSY? ANTSY: A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5? So S is at position4? Good. Also: ANTSY has A at 1? And contains T, N, Y? And avoids R, I, E? Then let's consider:

But note: in ANTSY, the A is at position1? This would be a good candidate? Then we can check:
  If the secret word has A at position1? Then we would expect a ✓? Or if it is elsewhere? 
  Also, we can test N, T, S? Note S is already at position4? So it's known? 

Alternatively: put A at position5: then pattern: _ _ _ S A? Words? Like? 
  CONGA? CONGA: C1 O2 N3 G4 A5? Wait: position4 is G? We need position4 to be S? So that doesn't work.

Or words with A in the middle: position3? Pattern: _ _ A S _ 
  Words: CLASS? CLASS: C1 L2 A3 S4 S5? But has two S? So CLASS? 
      CLASS has S at position4? And A at position3? And letters C, L, S? Also avoids R, I, E? Then yes.

But wait: CLASS has two S? Then if the secret word has only one S? That might cause feedback issue? But let's see: if the secret word has exactly one S at position4, then in CLASS guess:
  C: ? 
  L: ?
  A: ✓? If A is at position3? 
  First S: position4? ✓
  Second S: position5? then should be marked as 'x'? Because there is no second S? 

Actually, the feedback rules: 
  If the secret word has a letter only once, and you guess two, then the first occurrence of the letter (in the guess) that can be matched will get a ✓ or -, and the redundant one will be marked as x? Typically? 

But the rules says: 
  ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols""

And the symbols are assigned independently? But actually, the standard Wordle method is: 

  First check for exact matches? Then mark those letters? Then check the remaining for misplaced.

Therefore: 
  Consider secret word: GLASS? 
    Guess: CLASS? 
      Positions: 
        Position4: S? Secret has S at position4? → S4 ✓? 
        Then for the fifth S? The secret has another S? So that S is also present? But then we have to mark it? But wait, the secret has two S? And the guess has two S? And the first one at position4 is already matched? So the fifth position: S? matches? But wait: the secret has S at position4 and also at position5? So the guess fifth S? Then it would be matched? So ✓? 

  Alternatively: secret word was something else? Only one S? Then CLASS:
        Position4: S (secret has S at position4) → ✓
        Position5: S (secret has only one S? Then already matched? Therefore, no S left → x? 

But since we haven't seen the secret word? Let me not overcomplicate.

But note: we know from the feedback that A is present? But we don't know if it appears once or more? Similarly, the secret word may have duplicate letters? So we have to be careful.

Given that, I will try to find words that avoid duplicate letters? To make feedback cleaner? Or accept that duplicates are possible.

But in our next guess, we can avoid using duplicate letters? Because we want maximum information? 

So let me avoid duplicates? So the word has exactly five distinct letters? But we have to? Not required? But for guessing, using distinct letters can help get information for other letters? 

Now: our constraints:
  Position4: must be S? 
  The word must contain A? (exactly one? we don't know? but at least one) and avoid R, I, E? 
  We can test other letters? 

Example words:
  ANTSY? I think ANTSY is a valid word? (antsy: nervous)

ANTSY: 
  Positions:
    1: A? Then we test A: which could be ✓ if the secret word has A at start? Or '-' if elsewhere? Or if duplicate? 
  We also test N, T, S? But S is at position4? fixed? 
  Letters: A, N, T, S, Y? Distinct? and avoid R,I,E? 

Also consider words like:
  CAMPS? CAMPS: C1, A2, M3, P4, S5? Oh wait: position4 is P? But we need position4 to be S? 

Also: GASSY? G1 A2 S3 S4 Y5? Has duplicate S? So position4 is S? Good? But then A is at position2? But we cannot put A at position2? Because in our first guess, A was at position2? And it's marked as '-' meaning not here? But wait: that was for the word RAISE? Now we are guessing GASSY? 

Important: the feedback on the first guess told us that A is not in position2? So in the secret word, A is in a position other than 2? 

Therefore, in our next guess? We must not put A at position2? Because we know it's not!? Exactly? 

So if we put A at position2 in our guess? Then what? 
  In GASSY: A at position2? Then the secret word? If the secret word has A at position2? Why was it marked as '-'? That is confusing? 

We must be careful: the first guess's feedback: A was marked as '-' meaning that the letter A exists in the word? But not in position2? So we know that in the secret word, position2 is NOT A? 

Therefore, if we put A at position2 in a new guess? Then we will definitely get a '-' (if the secret word actually has A?)?

But wait: if the secret word has A at position2? Then it would have been ✓? But it wasn't? So we know position2 is not A? So for GASSY? We are putting A at position2? Then the feedback would be: '-'? But we already know it's not at position2? So we don't gain new information? Worse, we are wasting a slot? So we should avoid putting A at position2? 

Moreover, we know it's not at position2? So any guess should place A elsewhere.

Therefore, in GASSY? it's invalid? Because we are putting A at position2? Then the feedback will say: yes, A is in the word? But not at position2? But we already know? So what's the point? We should put A somewhere else? Maybe to test another position? 

Actually, we can put A at position2? to test? But no? because we know it's not? So we are sure? So putting A at position2? Then we will get a '-'? But we know? So no new information? 

So we should avoid? 

Therefore, avoid using A at position2? in any guess? 

So let me find words with:
  Pattern: _ _ _ S ? 
  Must include A? but not at position2? 
  Avoid R, I, E? 
  And using other common letters? 

Options:
  Position1: A? Then words like: A _ _ S _ ? 
      Example: ANTSY? 
      Also: ABYSS? has a lot of S? so duplicate? 
             ABYSS: A1,B2,Y3,S4,S5? Duplicate S? 
  Position3: A? Then words: _ _ A S ? 
      Example: CHASM? CHASM: C1 H2 A3 S4 M5? 
      Also: CLASP? but more than 5? 

  Position5: A? Then words: _ _ _ S A? 
      Examples: MANSA? but obscure? 
      Words: There are words? LAMPS? but position4: P? 
         How about PATHS? PATHS: P1 A2 T3 H4 S5? Now S is at position5? We need position4? 
         Not working? 
         Words ending with SA? Like MANSA? Or VISTA? VISTA: V1 I2 S3 T4 A5? Then S at position3? 

Conclusion: 
  Positions for A: 1 or 3? Because we cannot use position2? and position5 might be difficult? 

Let me consider: 
  ANTSY: A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5? 
      This contains A at start? So test position1? Also N at position2? T at position3? Avoids R,I,E? 

But wait: we also know that position2? In ANTSY: we are using N at position2? What if the secret word has A at position2? No? We know it doesn't? So no conflict? But we are using N? which is new? 

Also: CHASM? C1, H2, A3, S4, M5? 
      Then A at position3? We are testing? 

Which word is better? 

We also need to cover more letters? So ANTSY: tests A, N, T, Y? 
CHASM: tests C, H, A, M? 

Both are valid words? 

Now: common letters? 
  N and T are more common than C, H, M? So ANTSY might cover more common letters? 

Let me see the frequencies:

  Letter frequencies (from high to low): 
    E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, Y, F, V, K, W, Z, X, J, Q

So A: high? Now we are testing A? But we know A exists? so we don't need to confirm existence? Instead, we want to pin down the position? 

But also we test other letters? 

For ANTSY: 
  Letters: A (already known? but we want to test its position?), N, T, S (known? already ✓ at position4? so only position4 must be S? In our guess we set S at position4? which should always be? so it will be ✓ again? 

Therefore, guess ANTSY: 
  Positions:
    1: A? → if the secret word has A at position1? then ✓? otherwise, if elsewhere? then '-'? 
    2: N? → new letter? 
    3: T? → new letter? 
    4: S? → we already know? ✓? 
    5: Y? → new letter? 

Similarly for CHASM: 
  1: C → if present? 
  2: H → ? 
  3: A? → if secret word has A at position3? then ✓? 
  4: S? → ✓? 
  5: M → new? 

Between ANTSY and CHASM? The commonality: 
  ANTSY tests A at 1? and N, T, Y? 
  CHASM tests A at 3? and C, H, M? 

Which is better? 

We know that A is in the word? But we don't know the position? So we can test position1? if we get ✓? Then we know!? If not? Then it must be position3? or 5? But wait, are there other positions? We excluded position2? and we haven't tested position5? but we said position5 words are hard? 

In our constraints? Pattern: _ _ _ S _? So the first three letters? or fifth? 

Also, we might have words where A is at position5? But we need S in the fourth? 

Let me find: are there words with A at position5? and S at position4? 
  Words ending with SA? Actually, most English words with S at fourth? Then fifth? Not necessarily? 

Examples: 
  QUASI? QUASI: Q1 U2 A3 S4 I5? But I5? We cannot use I? Because we know I is not present? So invalid? 
  Also: TANSY? TANSY: T1 A2 N3 S4 Y5? Wait: A at position2? But we cannot use A at position2? So invalid? 
  MANAS? MANAS: M1 A2 N3 A4 S5? A2? invalid? 

How about words like: VASAL? VASAL: V1 A2 S3 A4 L5? A2? invalid? 

So I think: position5? There are words? LAMSA? Not a word? 

So we are left with position1 or position3 for A? 

Now: should we guess A at position1? or position3? 

By guessing A at position1? we can test it? And if it's ✓? Then we know? And if not? Then we know it must be position3 or higher? Later? 

Similarly? By guessing A at position3? we can test? 

But note: if we guess A at position1? and we get ✓? Then we know the first letter? And also S at the fourth? Then we can ignore position3? But wait: position3? We don't know? 

But also? if we get A at position1 ✓? Then we have two letters? and we know the rest must be letters not R,I,E? 

Alternatively? if we guess CHASM? A at position3? and it turns out A is actually at position3? Then we know first letter? Also?

But if we guess A at position1? and A is actually at position3? Then it will be marked as '-'? Meaning present? but not here? Which we already know? So no new information? Except that it is not at position1? Then we know it must be position3? 

So: 

  Option1: guess ANTSY?
    If A is at position1? then we get ✓ for A? and then we know: word begins with A? and then _ , _ , S? and the fifth letter? Also? 
    If not? Then A gets '-'? and then we know A must be at position3? Because we've avoided position2? and we can't have it at position4? which is S? 

But wait: the secret word: 
  position4 is S? 
  The letter A? cannot be at position2? and if it's at position4? Then A=S? That can't be? So A must be either position1 or position3 or position5? But we couldn't find words for position5? Which leaves? position1 and 3? 

Therefore, if we guess ANTSY? 
  Possible outcomes:
    If A is at position1? then ✓? 
    If A is at position3? then at our guess position1? A → we get '-'? 
    If A is at position5? which is very rare? then we get '-'? 

But we haven't tested position5 so far? 

Alternatively? Guess a word that tests two positions? But we have limited choices? Let me try to think: 

Word: PLAYS? Has S at position5? No? 

Another idea: guess a word that puts A at position5? Even if we didn't find? We can create a word? But we must use English words. 

What about the word: MASSA? Not valid? 

Word: TASSA? No? 

Word: PASSA? Not common? Let me list? 

Valid words: 
  MANAS? But not standard? and A at position2? invalid? 
  KANS? 4 letters? 
  There might be less common words? 

Another possibility: YEAHS? But E? We cannot use E? 

So probably? We cannot cover position5? Therefore? it's either 1 or 3? 

Thus? ANTSY would test position1? 

But? What about the word: CHASM? Which tests position3? 

Given this? I prefer to cover? maybe test A at position3? Why? Because position1? We can test later? But note: we are at the second guess? and we have 6 tries? 

Also? we can choose ANTSY? because it tests? more common letters? N, T, and Y? 

Alternatively? What is more efficient? 

We can choose a word that covers? two possibilities? But it's hard? 

Therefore? I suggest? guessing? ANTSY? 

But wait? let me see? ANTSY: if the secret word has A at position3? then our guess: ANTSY? 
  Position1: A? → not present? This secret word? Then we mark A: 
    If the secret word has A at position3? Then our A at position1? should get 'x'? But wait: it would be marked as '-'? because A exists in the word? 
    Even though same letter? Because A exists? but not? at position1? Then we get '-'? 

But wait: this confusion? 

Actually? standard rules: 
  For ANTSY? against a secret word? say? at the secret word? A at position3: 
    Secret: _ _ A S _
    Guess: ANTSY: 
      Position1: A? → the secret word? Does it have A at position1? No? but it has A? at position3? So this A in position1? should be marked as '-'? 
      Then position2: N? If the secret has letter at position2? We don't care? 
      Position3: T? if the secret has T? → but we don't know? 
      Position4: S? ✓? 
      Position5: Y? 

So? We get? A at position1 marked as '-'? meaning? A exists? but not at position1? 

Then we know A? must be at? position3? or 5? 

Because? we excluded position2? and position1? then? 

Similarly? if the secret word had A at position5? then we also get '-' at A (position1) of ANTSY? 

But how do we distinguish between A at position3 and A at position5? 

That's a problem? 

After ANTSY? if A at position1? marked as? then ✓? or if not? then '-'? meaning A exists? not at position1? However? then we still have ambiguity? 

To avoid that? we can choose a word that has A at position3? so we test directly position3? 

Therefore? CHASM? might be better? 

CHASM: 
  Positions: 
    1: C? new? 
    2: H? new? 
    3: A? Then feedback: 
        If the secret has A at position3? then ✓? 
        If it has A? elsewhere (position1 or 5)? Then '-'? 
    4: S? ✓? 
    5: M? new? 

But if the secret has A at position1? Then CHASM:
  Position1: C? compared to A? → not match? but secret has A at position1? which is not in our guess's letter1? But wait? our guess's letter1 is C? Then? 
        C? should be checked: not present? → x? 
        Then? A? at position3? even if? the secret has a A? at position3? But wait? it also has one at position1? Then we have:

        Secret: A? _ _ S _? and at position3? we don't know? 

        But: the secret has A? and our guess has A at position3? Then if the secret has A at position3? then it's ✓? Otherwise? '-'? 

        If the secret has A at position1 and also position3? Then we would get: 
          C: x (because not in? or if A is duplicated? then: 
          We would have A in guess at position3? matched to A at position3? then ✓? 
          And the A at position1 of secret? not matched? 

        If the secret has A only at position1? then our A at position3? is not at the correct position? but present? so '-'? 

        So the feedback would show: 
          Position1: x? 
          Position3: ✓? if A at position3? Or '-'? if A exists? but not at position3? 

But the secret cannot have both A at position1 and position3? Because we already know that A is present? we don't know about multiplicities? 

But? importantly? by not testing position1? we can miss? 

However? Given that we can only test one position at a time? 

So I propose CHASM? which tests A at position3? 

Then after the feedback? we will know:
  For A?:
    If we get ✓ at position3? then we know A? is at position3? 
    If we get '-'? Which would be at position3? then? that means A is not at position3? but present? then we know A must be at position1? or position5? 
    If we get x? Cannot? Then we know nothing? 

But wait: no? We know A exists? So in CHASM? 
  If the secret word has A at position3? then ✓? 
  If the secret word has A but not at position3? then '-'? 

Since position3 must be matched? 

Therefore? I think CHASM? is better? 

Alternatively? if we use a word that has A at position1 and also includes? a common letter at position5? But no? 

Therefore? I choose CHASM? 

So let's go with CHASM?After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":  
- **R, I, E are eliminated** since they are marked as absent (x).  
- **S is fixed at position 4** (✓) in the secret word.  
- **A is present but not in position 2** (-), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  

Given the constraints and common English words:  
- The secret word must fit the pattern `_ _ _ S _`, containing the letter A (not in position 2).  
- Letters R, I, E are excluded.  

For this second guess:  
- **Testing position 3 for A** helps narrow down its location efficiently.  
- **CHASM (C1 H2 A3 S4 M5)** is chosen because:  
  - It tests A in position 3 (to resolve ambiguity).  
  - Includes new common letters (C, H, M) to probe the word structure.  
  - Avoids eliminated letters (R, I, E) and the forbidden position 2 for A.  
- If A is in position 3, we get direct confirmation; otherwise, the feedback (- or ✓) will clarify A's true position or reveal new letters.

<guess>CHASM</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: CHASM -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(-) S(✓) M(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
This tells us:
- R is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not at position 2.
- I is not in the word.
- S is in the word and at position 4 (so the fourth letter is S).
- E is not in the word.

Guess 2: CHASM -> C(x) H(x) A(-) S(✓) M(x)
This tells us:
- C is not in the word.
- H is not in the word.
- A is in the word but not at position 3 (since in CHASM, A was at position 3 and we got '-' meaning present but wrong position? Actually, CHASM positions: C(1), H(2), A(3), S(4), M(5). So A at position 3 gets '-', meaning it is in the word but not at position 3.
- S at position 4 is still correct (✓).
- M is not in the word.

In summary:

Confirmed letters:
- Position 4 is S.

Present letters (but not at specific positions):
- A is present, but not at position 2 (from RAISE) and not at position 3 (from CHASM).

Absent letters: R, I, E, C, H, M.

Also note: We know the word has A and it must be at position 1 or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are now excluded, and position 4 is taken by S). So the word pattern is:
Position 1: could be A or another letter? But we know A must be in one of the positions 1 or 5? Actually, the positions: 1, 5, or possibly multiple? But given that we only have two guesses, we haven't tested position 5 for A? So A must appear in either position 1 or position 5? Or could it be duplicated? But we haven't seen duplicates? However, possible.

But note: if A were at position 5, then from RAISE (which had A at position 2) we got '-', meaning A is present? Same for CHASM? So if the word has A at position 1 and position 5? It's possible? But that's not necessary? We only know at least one A? and that it is not at 2 or 3.

So possible locations for A: 1 or 5.

Also, we know the word must contain exactly the letters: A, S, and three others? which are not R,I,E,C,H,M? And S at position 4.

So we need to form a 5-letter word: 
Pattern: _ _ _ S _ 
where one of the blanks (position 1 or 5) is A? or both? But we don't know? So we must guess a word that tests these? 

Now, we want to use new letters? We have eliminated R,I,E,C,H,M? So available letters: common ones like O, T, L, N, U, D, P, etc.

Given that A must be at position 1 or 5? What words exist? 

Option 1: A at position 1? Then word: A _ _ S _ 
Option 2: A at position 5? Then word: _ _ _ S A

There is also the possibility? that A is at position 1 and we have a letter at position 5? Or A at position 5 and we have a letter at position 1? 

Now, we should choose a word that tests? Where we put A? If we put A at one of them? then the feedback will tell? 

But note: if A is not at the position we guess? we get '-'? but we know? Or if we get ✓? then it's there? 

I think we need to choose a word that covers one scenario? 

For instance? let's assume if we put A at position 1? then:
  If the secret word has A at position 1? we get ✓? Then we know? And if not? we get '-'? meaning it must be at position 5? 

Similarly? if we put A at position 5? 
  If ✓? then A at 5? 
  If '-'? then A must be at position 1? 

So there's no harm? and we can use? that? 

But we can then pick a word that tests? multiple letters? 

So let's try to find words: 

Case 1: Word with A at position 1? Pattern: A _ _ S _ 
  Examples: ANTSY? But we already tried ANTSY? No? We didn't? We considered? ANTSY: A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5? that works? And avoids eliminated letters? 

Case 2: Word with A at position 5? Pattern: _ _ _ S A? 
  Words: MANSA? Not common? 
  Words: AROSA? Not English? 
  Words: VISTA? VISTA? Positions: V1? I2? S3? T4? A5? But I2: I is eliminated? So invalid? 
  Words: PATSA? Not a word? 
  Words: SATSA? No? 
  Words: LATSA? No? 
  Words: DATSA? No? 
  Words: HATSA? No? 
  Words: JATS? 4 letters? 
  Words: Yacks? But E? 
  Conclusion: it is hard to find English words that end with SA and are 5 letters? that do not contain the eliminated letters? We exclude R,I,E,C,H,M? 

Therefore? we choose ANTSY? 

ANTSY: 
  It has A at position 1? 
  Letters: A, N, T, S, Y? which are allowed? 

But wait? ANTSY: 
  We haven't tested N, T, Y? 

Feedback will tell us? 
  If A is at position 1? then ✓? 
  If not? we get '-'? meaning A exists? but not here? but we already know? So no new information? And then? the other positions? 

But if we get A at position 1: ✓? Then we know? 
  The word: A _ _ S _ 
  and then from ANTSY? we get? 
  Position 2: N? new? 
  Position 3: T? new? 
  Position 5: Y? new? 

And then? we have to deduce? 

But if A is not at position 1? then in ANTSY? 
  Position 1: A? will be '-'? meaning? A is present? but not here? then we know? A must be at position 5? 

So? we gain information? 

Therefore? I think ANTSY? is the next best guess? 

Alternatively? we can design? to test both? 

But ANTSY: we are testing position 1: A? And if accepted? then we know? And if not? we know A is at position 5? 

Also? we test new letters? 

But note: the letter S? at position4? we already know? so ✓? 

Potential drawback: 
  If the word has A at position 5? and we guess ANTSY? which has A at position 1? and gets '-'? Then we know A should be at position 5? Then the word pattern? becomes: _ _ _ S A? 

Then we have to guess? And we have an extra try? 

But we have 4 tries left? 

So we go with ANTSY? 

After the feedback, we will know more? 

So: 

<guess>ANTSY</guess>

But let me think: 

Another candidate: what about PLANE? But for PLANE: P L A N E? 
But E is eliminated? so invalid? 

TOAST? O and A? But TOAST: T1 O2 A3 S4 T5? 
But S4? is correct? 
But A3: but we already tried A at position3? and got '-', meaning? not at position3? 
But here? we are putting A at position3? again? So feedback? It would be '-' again? 
But no new information? 
Also? does not test position1? 

Similarly? SALTS? S at position1? But word: S A L T S? 
But S is duplicated? 
Also? A at position2? excluded? because first feedback? So we know? position2 is not A? 
Therefore? SALTS: 
  Position1: S? but secret word: position4 is S? So if there's only one S? Then we might get? 
      Position1: S (duplicate? no? if only one S? then? This S? is not at position4? but we get '-'? because S occurs? 
      Then A: at position2? which? we know is not? so '-'? again? 
  And etc? 

So not optimized? 

Therefore? I stick with ANTSY? 

So guess: ANTSYBased on the feedback from both guesses:
- **S is confirmed at position 4** (✓ from RAISE and CHASM).
- **A is present** but not at positions 2 (from RAISE) or 3 (from CHASM), leaving positions 1 or 5 as possible locations.
- **Eliminated letters**: R, I, E, C, H, M (marked x in previous feedback).

The secret word fits the pattern `_ _ _ S _`, with A in position 1 or 5. For the third guess:
- **ANTSY (A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5)** is chosen because:
  1. It tests A at position 1 to resolve its location:
     - If ✓, A is at position 1.
     - If -, A must be at position 5.
  2. Uses new high-frequency letters (N, T, Y) to probe unknown positions.
  3. Avoids eliminated letters and reuses S at its known position (✓ guaranteed).
  4. Maximizes information gain by clarifying A’s position while testing three new letters.

Since we have no prior information, we want a starting word that has common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L, etc.).\n One popular starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"", but let me think also about maximizing information.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. are good. But note we are allowed 6 tries.\n\n Considering the feedback for the first guess is crucial because it sets the stage.\n\n I will choose ""SLATE"". Why?\n - It has two of the most common vowels: A and E.\n - It uses common consonants: S, L, T.\n\n But note: we are not told any constraints and must produce a valid English word.\n\n Let me confirm ""SLATE"" is a word: yes, it means a thin piece of rock or a list of candidates.\n\n However, let me think about another popular one: ""RAISE"" is also good because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n\n However, in the instructions, the example used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We are free to choose.\n\n But note: the feedback symbols:\n   ✓ : correct letter and correct position\n   - : letter in word but wrong position\n   x : letter not in word\n\n We want to maximize the information we get on the first try. That is, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n According to some analyses, the letters that appear most frequently in English 5-letter words are (in order): E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, ... \n\n So words like ""LATER"" or ""ALTER"" are good? But let\'s see:\n\n I think ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because it uses three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S) that are very common.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word? Actually, ROATE is a valid word meaning an amount of revenue collected. But it is obscure.\n\n Another candidate is ""CRANE"". It uses C, R, A, N, E. That\'s also good.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: SLATE -> S, L, A, T, E\n Option 2: RAISE -> R, A, I, S, E\n Option 3: CRANE -> C, R, A, N, E\n\n Which has the highest probability of containing letters in the secret word?\n\n Since I\'m not sure, I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because:\n\n - It has three vowels: A, E and two consonants C, R, N (N is common too).\n - C and R are among the top consonants.\n\n Alternatively, note that the letter E is the most common vowel and the most common letter. So having E at the end is good.\n\n Decision: I\'ll start with ""CRANE"".\n\n But wait: in the example, the secret word was ""BRISK"". If I guessed ""CRANE"":\n   C is in ""BRISK""? No -> then x\n   R is in ""BRISK""? Yes -> but in position 2? In BRISK, R is at position 2, so that would be ✓? But wait, the secret word is BRISK and CRANE: \n        C vs B -> not same -> so C: x\n        R vs R -> same -> R: ✓\n        A vs I -> different -> A: is A in BRISK? No -> x\n        N vs S -> different -> N: not in BRISK -> x\n        E vs K -> different -> E: not in BRISK -> x\n   So we get R in the correct position and the rest x.\n\n That gives us one letter and position, but we don\'t get information on other letters being present.\n\n Alternatively, if I choose a word with letters that are more common? Let\'s try ""SLATE"" on BRISK:\n\n   S: BRISK has S? Yes -> position? S is at position 1? Guess has S at position 1? Secret word: position 4 is S (if we count 1-indexed: B=1, R=2, I=3, S=4, K=5). So guess letter in position1: S -> secret position4: S -> so this is wrong position -> then \'-\' \n   L: in BRISK? -> No -> x\n   A: No -> x\n   T: No -> x\n   E: No -> x\n\n Then we get one \'-\' and four x\'s. So we know S is present but in the wrong position.\n\n So which gives more information? In both cases we got one valuable piece. But with ""CRANE"", we know R is in position2 and that\'s fixed. With ""SLATE"" we know S is present but not in position1 -> then it must be in positions 2,3,4, or5.\n\n But note: we can get more than one letter? That depends on the secret word.\n\n Another candidate: ""ROAST"" -> let\'s try on BRISK:\n   R: position1 vs position2 of secret -> not same -> but present -> \'-\'\n   O: not present -> x\n   A: not present -> x\n   S: BRISK has S at position4 -> guess has S at position3? -> so no -> present -> \'-\'\n   T: not present -> x\n\n Then we get two \'-\' and three x. We know R and S are present but not in position1 and position3 respectively.\n\n How about ""RAISE"" on BRISK?\n   R: present -> compare position? position1 of guess vs secret: R at position1? secret has R at position2 -> so wrong -> \'-\'\n   A: not present -> x\n   I: BRISK has I at position3 -> guess has at position2? -> so wrong -> \'-\'\n   S: present -> at position4? guess has at position4? -> no, at position3? guess position3: I -> then S is at position4? In guess, S is at position4? But secret has S at position4? \n        Actually: \n        Guess: R (1), A(2), I(3), S(4), E(5)\n        Secret: B(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), K(5)\n        So:\n          R: wrong position -> \'-\'\n          A: x\n          I: position matches? guess position3 and secret position3 -> same -> ✓\n          S: position4? also same -> ✓\n          E: x\n        So the feedback would be: R(-), A(x), I(✓), S(✓), E(x)\n\n Then we get two ✓ and one \'-\'. That\'s great.\n\n Therefore, ""RAISE"" seems to have the potential for more hits? But note that we are showing an example where it works well for BRISK.\n\n However, we don\'t know the secret word. Therefore, we need a word that gives maximum information in the average case.\n\n According to some sources, the starting words that are optimal include CRANE, SALET, ROATE, SOARE, etc.\n\n However, I remember that ""RAISE"" is one of the top starting words because it uses R, A, I, S, E which are among the top 10 most common letters.\n\n So I will go with ""RAISE"".\n\n Let me double-check: \n   R is the 3rd most common letter (in the top list I recalled: E, A, R, ...) -> so R is very common.\n   A is the 2nd most common.\n   I is a common vowel -> 7th?\n   S is 8th?\n   E -> the most common.\n\n So it\'s a good mix.\n\n Therefore, my first guess will be ""RAISE"".I need to make an effective first guess for this Wordle-style game. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that maximizes the information I gain from the feedback. This means prioritizing common letters in English 5-letter words.\n\nAfter analyzing letter frequency:\n- Vowels like A, E, I, O are common\n- Consonants like R, S, T, N, L are frequent\n- Ideally, the word should include several high-frequency letters\n\nWords like ""RAISE"" work well because:\n- It contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)\n- Uses 5 distinct letters to maximize coverage\n- R, A, I, S, E are all top-10 frequent letters in English  \n\nAlternative starters like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are also strong, but ""RAISE"" has slight advantages:\n- Higher vowel density helps test frequent letter categories\n- Ending in E exploits a common word-ending pattern\n- Balanced letter distribution improves feedback clarity\n\nThis guess will efficiently reveal:\n- Which letters in {R, A, I, S, E} exist in the secret word\n- Which positions might be partially correct  \n- Vowel/consonant relationships to guide subsequent guesses\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on our first guess ""RAISE"":\n  R: x -> not present in the word\n  A: - -> present but in the wrong position\n  I: x -> not present\n  S: ✓ -> correct position (so S must be the fourth letter of the secret word)\n  E: x -> not present\n\nSo what we know:\n- The secret word has the letter **A**, but not in the second position (where we had A in RAISE). However, it could be in any position except 2? Actually, the feedback only says it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in positions 1, 3, 5? Remember that positions are fixed: \n    Position1: R -> not in word\n    Position2: A -> in word but not here\n    Position3: I -> not in word\n    Position4: S -> correct and in position\n    Position5: E -> not in word\n\n- Therefore, the secret word has:\n  - S at the fourth position? Wait: the fourth letter is S. Since we wrote RAISE: \n      R (pos1), A (pos2), I (pos3), S (pos4), E (pos5)\n  So the fourth letter of the secret word is S.\n\n- The letter A must appear somewhere else: so positions 1, 3, or 5? But note: position5 is not available because we also know E is not present and also note:\n  We know that position1 cannot be A? Actually, we cannot be certain until we test. But we know A is not in position2. \n\nHowever, we also know:\n- R is not in the word at all? So any position? So we must avoid R in the rest of the word.\n- Similarly, I and E are absent.\n\nTherefore, the secret word:\n- Contains the letter A (but not at position 2) and S (at position 4)\n- Does not contain R, I, E.\n\nSince we have S fixed at position4, we can now make a new guess.\n\nWe must also consider:\n- The word must have 5 letters, and we know two: the fourth is S, and A is present somewhere else (positions 1,3,5?).\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 3, or 5? But position5 is last, which is common for vowels? But wait, A can be at the beginning or middle.\n\nMoreover, we have to pick a word that excludes R, I, E.\n\nCommon English words with S in the fourth position and containing A.\n\nLooking for patterns: we can represent the word as: _ _ _ S _\n\nAnd A must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5? But note: also the second position is already excluded? And we may consider that A could be in the fifth? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut also remember: we have not set the rest of the letters. So we need to guess a word that:\n1. Has the fourth letter S.\n2. Contains the letter A (but not as the second letter? But actually the feedback said A is in the wrong position, meaning specifically that it is not in position2? But in the new word, we can put A anywhere except that we know it\'s not in position2? Actually, we are guessing another word so we can put A wherever we want? But the feedback tells us that in the secret word, A is in a different position than the second.\n\nBut importantly, we should avoid using R, I, E anywhere.\n\nNow, we can choose a word that has A in either position1, 3, or 5? And also we know the fourth is S.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters to get more information. In particular, common consonants and vowels.\n\nWhat letters can we use? We can try to include other common letters that are not excluded: so avoid R, I, E. Common letters: O, T, L, N, etc.\n\nIdea: try to put A in position1? Or position3? Or position5? Probably we should test a few possibilities? And also include new letters.\n\nLet me think of words with S in the fourth position? For example:\n- The word ends with S? But here is in the fourth position? So the fifth letter can be something else.\n\nPattern: __ __ __ S __\n\nSo the last letter is the fifth.\n\nWords ending with ""S_"" are not common? Actually, no: the word has five letters? So the fifth is one character.\n\nExamples of words that have S in the fourth position? \n  GLASS -> G L A S S? Wait: this has five letters: positions? \n      G1, L2, A3, S4, S5? But that\'s five letters. Then S is the fourth letter? Yes.\n\nBut in GLASS: \n  Letters: G, L, A, S, S? Then S is the fourth letter? And then the fifth letter is also S? So two S\'s? But our feedback didn\'t say anything about duplicate letters? So it\'s possible.\n\nBut we know that A is present: in GLASS, A is at position3.\n\nBut note: we have feedback that A is not at position2? Which is true? But wait, the word could have duplicate letters? But our first guess RAISE didn\'t have duplicates? So maybe duplicates are allowed?\n\nNow let\'s see the feedback: we had RAISE -> A was marked as \'-\' meaning present: so the secret word must have at least one A. In GLASS, it has A? Yes. But also note: GLASS has two S: but we have S at position4 being ✓, so if we guess GLASS and the secret word has an S at position4? Then at position5? Let me check.\n\nActually, our feedback indicated that only S was fixed? So we need to see how the game handles duplicates? The rules don\'t clarify? But typically:\n\nAssume standard Wordle rules: if there is one S in the secret word but two S in the guess, then one might get marked as green and the other as yellow? Or if the secret word has two, then both might get yellow/green accordingly.\n\nBut in our case, we have S at position4: ✓. And then if there\'s another S? Then we don\'t know until we see.\n\nBut since we don\'t have information about duplicate S? We are not forbidden? But also note: we didn\'t see an extra S? Because in RAISE, we only had one S? So if the secret word had an extra S? Then our RAISE wouldn\'t have shown in feedback? Actually, the feedback would only show what exists.\n\nFor example, if the secret word is GLASS? Then it has S at position4 and also position5. Then for RAISE:\n\n  RAISE: \n    R -> not in GLASS? So x (correct)\n    A -> in GLASS? At position3 -> so present: wait, we would get marked by \'-\'? And it was: A is \'-\'? Because it\'s present? But not at position2? So feedback: R(x) A(-) ... \n    I -> not present: so x? Correct.\n    S -> at position4: RAISE has S at position4? Secret word has S at position4? So ✓? Correct. \n    E -> not present? In GLASS? So E: x? Correct.\n\nBut note: in GLASS, it has an extra S? But our RAISE has only one S? Then the feedback wouldn\'t mark the fifth S? So we don\'t know? Therefore, we might need to consider duplicate letters.\n\nBut for this guess, we can pick a word that doesn\'t have duplicates? Or do we? Actually not necessary.\n\nI\'ll try to pick a word with S at position4? And containing A? And avoiding R, I, E? And also we want to test other common letters? Like O, T, L, N, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\nLet me consider: \n  A: at position1? words like: A _ _ S _ \n      Examples: ANSWERS? More than 5 letters? \n      5-letter words: ANTSY? ANTSY: A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5? So S is at position4? Good. Also: ANTSY has A at 1? And contains T, N, Y? And avoids R, I, E? Then let\'s consider:\n\nBut note: in ANTSY, the A is at position1? This would be a good candidate? Then we can check:\n  If the secret word has A at position1? Then we would expect a ✓? Or if it is elsewhere? \n  Also, we can test N, T, S? Note S is already at position4? So it\'s known? \n\nAlternatively: put A at position5: then pattern: _ _ _ S A? Words? Like? \n  CONGA? CONGA: C1 O2 N3 G4 A5? Wait: position4 is G? We need position4 to be S? So that doesn\'t work.\n\nOr words with A in the middle: position3? Pattern: _ _ A S _ \n  Words: CLASS? CLASS: C1 L2 A3 S4 S5? But has two S? So CLASS? \n      CLASS has S at position4? And A at position3? And letters C, L, S? Also avoids R, I, E? Then yes.\n\nBut wait: CLASS has two S? Then if the secret word has only one S? That might cause feedback issue? But let\'s see: if the secret word has exactly one S at position4, then in CLASS guess:\n  C: ? \n  L: ?\n  A: ✓? If A is at position3? \n  First S: position4? ✓\n  Second S: position5? then should be marked as \'x\'? Because there is no second S? \n\nActually, the feedback rules: \n  If the secret word has a letter only once, and you guess two, then the first occurrence of the letter (in the guess) that can be matched will get a ✓ or -, and the redundant one will be marked as x? Typically? \n\nBut the rules says: \n  ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols""\n\nAnd the symbols are assigned independently? But actually, the standard Wordle method is: \n\n  First check for exact matches? Then mark those letters? Then check the remaining for misplaced.\n\nTherefore: \n  Consider secret word: GLASS? \n    Guess: CLASS? \n      Positions: \n        Position4: S? Secret has S at position4? → S4 ✓? \n        Then for the fifth S? The secret has another S? So that S is also present? But then we have to mark it? But wait, the secret has two S? And the guess has two S? And the first one at position4 is already matched? So the fifth position: S? matches? But wait: the secret has S at position4 and also at position5? So the guess fifth S? Then it would be matched? So ✓? \n\n  Alternatively: secret word was something else? Only one S? Then CLASS:\n        Position4: S (secret has S at position4) → ✓\n        Position5: S (secret has only one S? Then already matched? Therefore, no S left → x? \n\nBut since we haven\'t seen the secret word? Let me not overcomplicate.\n\nBut note: we know from the feedback that A is present? But we don\'t know if it appears once or more? Similarly, the secret word may have duplicate letters? So we have to be careful.\n\nGiven that, I will try to find words that avoid duplicate letters? To make feedback cleaner? Or accept that duplicates are possible.\n\nBut in our next guess, we can avoid using duplicate letters? Because we want maximum information? \n\nSo let me avoid duplicates? So the word has exactly five distinct letters? But we have to? Not required? But for guessing, using distinct letters can help get information for other letters? \n\nNow: our constraints:\n  Position4: must be S? \n  The word must contain A? (exactly one? we don\'t know? but at least one) and avoid R, I, E? \n  We can test other letters? \n\nExample words:\n  ANTSY? I think ANTSY is a valid word? (antsy: nervous)\n\nANTSY: \n  Positions:\n    1: A? Then we test A: which could be ✓ if the secret word has A at start? Or \'-\' if elsewhere? Or if duplicate? \n  We also test N, T, S? But S is at position4? fixed? \n  Letters: A, N, T, S, Y? Distinct? and avoid R,I,E? \n\nAlso consider words like:\n  CAMPS? CAMPS: C1, A2, M3, P4, S5? Oh wait: position4 is P? But we need position4 to be S? \n\nAlso: GASSY? G1 A2 S3 S4 Y5? Has duplicate S? So position4 is S? Good? But then A is at position2? But we cannot put A at position2? Because in our first guess, A was at position2? And it\'s marked as \'-\' meaning not here? But wait: that was for the word RAISE? Now we are guessing GASSY? \n\nImportant: the feedback on the first guess told us that A is not in position2? So in the secret word, A is in a position other than 2? \n\nTherefore, in our next guess? We must not put A at position2? Because we know it\'s not!? Exactly? \n\nSo if we put A at position2 in our guess? Then what? \n  In GASSY: A at position2? Then the secret word? If the secret word has A at position2? Why was it marked as \'-\'? That is confusing? \n\nWe must be careful: the first guess\'s feedback: A was marked as \'-\' meaning that the letter A exists in the word? But not in position2? So we know that in the secret word, position2 is NOT A? \n\nTherefore, if we put A at position2 in a new guess? Then we will definitely get a \'-\' (if the secret word actually has A?)?\n\nBut wait: if the secret word has A at position2? Then it would have been ✓? But it wasn\'t? So we know position2 is not A? So for GASSY? We are putting A at position2? Then the feedback would be: \'-\'? But we already know it\'s not at position2? So we don\'t gain new information? Worse, we are wasting a slot? So we should avoid putting A at position2? \n\nMoreover, we know it\'s not at position2? So any guess should place A elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, in GASSY? it\'s invalid? Because we are putting A at position2? Then the feedback will say: yes, A is in the word? But not at position2? But we already know? So what\'s the point? We should put A somewhere else? Maybe to test another position? \n\nActually, we can put A at position2? to test? But no? because we know it\'s not? So we are sure? So putting A at position2? Then we will get a \'-\'? But we know? So no new information? \n\nSo we should avoid? \n\nTherefore, avoid using A at position2? in any guess? \n\nSo let me find words with:\n  Pattern: _ _ _ S ? \n  Must include A? but not at position2? \n  Avoid R, I, E? \n  And using other common letters? \n\nOptions:\n  Position1: A? Then words like: A _ _ S _ ? \n      Example: ANTSY? \n      Also: ABYSS? has a lot of S? so duplicate? \n             ABYSS: A1,B2,Y3,S4,S5? Duplicate S? \n  Position3: A? Then words: _ _ A S ? \n      Example: CHASM? CHASM: C1 H2 A3 S4 M5? \n      Also: CLASP? but more than 5? \n\n  Position5: A? Then words: _ _ _ S A? \n      Examples: MANSA? but obscure? \n      Words: There are words? LAMPS? but position4: P? \n         How about PATHS? PATHS: P1 A2 T3 H4 S5? Now S is at position5? We need position4? \n         Not working? \n         Words ending with SA? Like MANSA? Or VISTA? VISTA: V1 I2 S3 T4 A5? Then S at position3? \n\nConclusion: \n  Positions for A: 1 or 3? Because we cannot use position2? and position5 might be difficult? \n\nLet me consider: \n  ANTSY: A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5? \n      This contains A at start? So test position1? Also N at position2? T at position3? Avoids R,I,E? \n\nBut wait: we also know that position2? In ANTSY: we are using N at position2? What if the secret word has A at position2? No? We know it doesn\'t? So no conflict? But we are using N? which is new? \n\nAlso: CHASM? C1, H2, A3, S4, M5? \n      Then A at position3? We are testing? \n\nWhich word is better? \n\nWe also need to cover more letters? So ANTSY: tests A, N, T, Y? \nCHASM: tests C, H, A, M? \n\nBoth are valid words? \n\nNow: common letters? \n  N and T are more common than C, H, M? So ANTSY might cover more common letters? \n\nLet me see the frequencies:\n\n  Letter frequencies (from high to low): \n    E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, Y, F, V, K, W, Z, X, J, Q\n\nSo A: high? Now we are testing A? But we know A exists? so we don\'t need to confirm existence? Instead, we want to pin down the position? \n\nBut also we test other letters? \n\nFor ANTSY: \n  Letters: A (already known? but we want to test its position?), N, T, S (known? already ✓ at position4? so only position4 must be S? In our guess we set S at position4? which should always be? so it will be ✓ again? \n\nTherefore, guess ANTSY: \n  Positions:\n    1: A? → if the secret word has A at position1? then ✓? otherwise, if elsewhere? then \'-\'? \n    2: N? → new letter? \n    3: T? → new letter? \n    4: S? → we already know? ✓? \n    5: Y? → new letter? \n\nSimilarly for CHASM: \n  1: C → if present? \n  2: H → ? \n  3: A? → if secret word has A at position3? then ✓? \n  4: S? → ✓? \n  5: M → new? \n\nBetween ANTSY and CHASM? The commonality: \n  ANTSY tests A at 1? and N, T, Y? \n  CHASM tests A at 3? and C, H, M? \n\nWhich is better? \n\nWe know that A is in the word? But we don\'t know the position? So we can test position1? if we get ✓? Then we know!? If not? Then it must be position3? or 5? But wait, are there other positions? We excluded position2? and we haven\'t tested position5? but we said position5 words are hard? \n\nIn our constraints? Pattern: _ _ _ S _? So the first three letters? or fifth? \n\nAlso, we might have words where A is at position5? But we need S in the fourth? \n\nLet me find: are there words with A at position5? and S at position4? \n  Words ending with SA? Actually, most English words with S at fourth? Then fifth? Not necessarily? \n\nExamples: \n  QUASI? QUASI: Q1 U2 A3 S4 I5? But I5? We cannot use I? Because we know I is not present? So invalid? \n  Also: TANSY? TANSY: T1 A2 N3 S4 Y5? Wait: A at position2? But we cannot use A at position2? So invalid? \n  MANAS? MANAS: M1 A2 N3 A4 S5? A2? invalid? \n\nHow about words like: VASAL? VASAL: V1 A2 S3 A4 L5? A2? invalid? \n\nSo I think: position5? There are words? LAMSA? Not a word? \n\nSo we are left with position1 or position3 for A? \n\nNow: should we guess A at position1? or position3? \n\nBy guessing A at position1? we can test it? And if it\'s ✓? Then we know? And if not? Then we know it must be position3 or higher? Later? \n\nSimilarly? By guessing A at position3? we can test? \n\nBut note: if we guess A at position1? and we get ✓? Then we know the first letter? And also S at the fourth? Then we can ignore position3? But wait: position3? We don\'t know? \n\nBut also? if we get A at position1 ✓? Then we have two letters? and we know the rest must be letters not R,I,E? \n\nAlternatively? if we guess CHASM? A at position3? and it turns out A is actually at position3? Then we know first letter? Also?\n\nBut if we guess A at position1? and A is actually at position3? Then it will be marked as \'-\'? Meaning present? but not here? Which we already know? So no new information? Except that it is not at position1? Then we know it must be position3? \n\nSo: \n\n  Option1: guess ANTSY?\n    If A is at position1? then we get ✓ for A? and then we know: word begins with A? and then _ , _ , S? and the fifth letter? Also? \n    If not? Then A gets \'-\'? and then we know A must be at position3? Because we\'ve avoided position2? and we can\'t have it at position4? which is S? \n\nBut wait: the secret word: \n  position4 is S? \n  The letter A? cannot be at position2? and if it\'s at position4? Then A=S? That can\'t be? So A must be either position1 or position3 or position5? But we couldn\'t find words for position5? Which leaves? position1 and 3? \n\nTherefore, if we guess ANTSY? \n  Possible outcomes:\n    If A is at position1? then ✓? \n    If A is at position3? then at our guess position1? A → we get \'-\'? \n    If A is at position5? which is very rare? then we get \'-\'? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested position5 so far? \n\nAlternatively? Guess a word that tests two positions? But we have limited choices? Let me try to think: \n\nWord: PLAYS? Has S at position5? No? \n\nAnother idea: guess a word that puts A at position5? Even if we didn\'t find? We can create a word? But we must use English words. \n\nWhat about the word: MASSA? Not valid? \n\nWord: TASSA? No? \n\nWord: PASSA? Not common? Let me list? \n\nValid words: \n  MANAS? But not standard? and A at position2? invalid? \n  KANS? 4 letters? \n  There might be less common words? \n\nAnother possibility: YEAHS? But E? We cannot use E? \n\nSo probably? We cannot cover position5? Therefore? it\'s either 1 or 3? \n\nThus? ANTSY would test position1? \n\nBut? What about the word: CHASM? Which tests position3? \n\nGiven this? I prefer to cover? maybe test A at position3? Why? Because position1? We can test later? But note: we are at the second guess? and we have 6 tries? \n\nAlso? we can choose ANTSY? because it tests? more common letters? N, T, and Y? \n\nAlternatively? What is more efficient? \n\nWe can choose a word that covers? two possibilities? But it\'s hard? \n\nTherefore? I suggest? guessing? ANTSY? \n\nBut wait? let me see? ANTSY: if the secret word has A at position3? then our guess: ANTSY? \n  Position1: A? → not present? This secret word? Then we mark A: \n    If the secret word has A at position3? Then our A at position1? should get \'x\'? But wait: it would be marked as \'-\'? because A exists in the word? \n    Even though same letter? Because A exists? but not? at position1? Then we get \'-\'? \n\nBut wait: this confusion? \n\nActually? standard rules: \n  For ANTSY? against a secret word? say? at the secret word? A at position3: \n    Secret: _ _ A S _\n    Guess: ANTSY: \n      Position1: A? → the secret word? Does it have A at position1? No? but it has A? at position3? So this A in position1? should be marked as \'-\'? \n      Then position2: N? If the secret has letter at position2? We don\'t care? \n      Position3: T? if the secret has T? → but we don\'t know? \n      Position4: S? ✓? \n      Position5: Y? \n\nSo? We get? A at position1 marked as \'-\'? meaning? A exists? but not at position1? \n\nThen we know A? must be at? position3? or 5? \n\nBecause? we excluded position2? and position1? then? \n\nSimilarly? if the secret word had A at position5? then we also get \'-\' at A (position1) of ANTSY? \n\nBut how do we distinguish between A at position3 and A at position5? \n\nThat\'s a problem? \n\nAfter ANTSY? if A at position1? marked as? then ✓? or if not? then \'-\'? meaning A exists? not at position1? However? then we still have ambiguity? \n\nTo avoid that? we can choose a word that has A at position3? so we test directly position3? \n\nTherefore? CHASM? might be better? \n\nCHASM: \n  Positions: \n    1: C? new? \n    2: H? new? \n    3: A? Then feedback: \n        If the secret has A at position3? then ✓? \n        If it has A? elsewhere (position1 or 5)? Then \'-\'? \n    4: S? ✓? \n    5: M? new? \n\nBut if the secret has A at position1? Then CHASM:\n  Position1: C? compared to A? → not match? but secret has A at position1? which is not in our guess\'s letter1? But wait? our guess\'s letter1 is C? Then? \n        C? should be checked: not present? → x? \n        Then? A? at position3? even if? the secret has a A? at position3? But wait? it also has one at position1? Then we have:\n\n        Secret: A? _ _ S _? and at position3? we don\'t know? \n\n        But: the secret has A? and our guess has A at position3? Then if the secret has A at position3? then it\'s ✓? Otherwise? \'-\'? \n\n        If the secret has A at position1 and also position3? Then we would get: \n          C: x (because not in? or if A is duplicated? then: \n          We would have A in guess at position3? matched to A at position3? then ✓? \n          And the A at position1 of secret? not matched? \n\n        If the secret has A only at position1? then our A at position3? is not at the correct position? but present? so \'-\'? \n\n        So the feedback would show: \n          Position1: x? \n          Position3: ✓? if A at position3? Or \'-\'? if A exists? but not at position3? \n\nBut the secret cannot have both A at position1 and position3? Because we already know that A is present? we don\'t know about multiplicities? \n\nBut? importantly? by not testing position1? we can miss? \n\nHowever? Given that we can only test one position at a time? \n\nSo I propose CHASM? which tests A at position3? \n\nThen after the feedback? we will know:\n  For A?:\n    If we get ✓ at position3? then we know A? is at position3? \n    If we get \'-\'? Which would be at position3? then? that means A is not at position3? but present? then we know A must be at position1? or position5? \n    If we get x? Cannot? Then we know nothing? \n\nBut wait: no? We know A exists? So in CHASM? \n  If the secret word has A at position3? then ✓? \n  If the secret word has A but not at position3? then \'-\'? \n\nSince position3 must be matched? \n\nTherefore? I think CHASM? is better? \n\nAlternatively? if we use a word that has A at position1 and also includes? a common letter at position5? But no? \n\nTherefore? I choose CHASM? \n\nSo let\'s go with CHASM?After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":  \n- **R, I, E are eliminated** since they are marked as absent (x).  \n- **S is fixed at position 4** (✓) in the secret word.  \n- **A is present but not in position 2** (-), so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  \n\nGiven the constraints and common English words:  \n- The secret word must fit the pattern `_ _ _ S _`, containing the letter A (not in position 2).  \n- Letters R, I, E are excluded.  \n\nFor this second guess:  \n- **Testing position 3 for A** helps narrow down its location efficiently.  \n- **CHASM (C1 H2 A3 S4 M5)** is chosen because:  \n  - It tests A in position 3 (to resolve ambiguity).  \n  - Includes new common letters (C, H, M) to probe the word structure.  \n  - Avoids eliminated letters (R, I, E) and the forbidden position 2 for A.  \n- If A is in position 3, we get direct confirmation; otherwise, the feedback (- or ✓) will clarify A\'s true position or reveal new letters.\n\n<guess>CHASM</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: CHASM -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(-) S(✓) M(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""We have the following feedback:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nThis tells us:\n- R is not in the word.\n- A is in the word but not at position 2.\n- I is not in the word.\n- S is in the word and at position 4 (so the fourth letter is S).\n- E is not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: CHASM -> C(x) H(x) A(-) S(✓) M(x)\nThis tells us:\n- C is not in the word.\n- H is not in the word.\n- A is in the word but not at position 3 (since in CHASM, A was at position 3 and we got '-' meaning present but wrong position? Actually, CHASM positions: C(1), H(2), A(3), S(4), M(5). So A at position 3 gets '-', meaning it is in the word but not at position 3.\n- S at position 4 is still correct (✓).\n- M is not in the word.\n\nIn summary:\n\nConfirmed letters:\n- Position 4 is S.\n\nPresent letters (but not at specific positions):\n- A is present, but not at position 2 (from RAISE) and not at position 3 (from CHASM).\n\nAbsent letters: R, I, E, C, H, M.\n\nAlso note: We know the word has A and it must be at position 1 or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are now excluded, and position 4 is taken by S). So the word pattern is:\nPosition 1: could be A or another letter? But we know A must be in one of the positions 1 or 5? Actually, the positions: 1, 5, or possibly multiple? But given that we only have two guesses, we haven't tested position 5 for A? So A must appear in either position 1 or position 5? Or could it be duplicated? But we haven't seen duplicates? However, possible.\n\nBut note: if A were at position 5, then from RAISE (which had A at position 2) we got '-', meaning A is present? Same for CHASM? So if the word has A at position 1 and position 5? It's possible? But that's not necessary? We only know at least one A? and that it is not at 2 or 3.\n\nSo possible locations for A: 1 or 5.\n\nAlso, we know the word must contain exactly the letters: A, S, and three others? which are not R,I,E,C,H,M? And S at position 4.\n\nSo we need to form a 5-letter word: \nPattern: _ _ _ S _ \nwhere one of the blanks (position 1 or 5) is A? or both? But we don't know? So we must guess a word that tests these? \n\nNow, we want to use new letters? We have eliminated R,I,E,C,H,M? So available letters: common ones like O, T, L, N, U, D, P, etc.\n\nGiven that A must be at position 1 or 5? What words exist? \n\nOption 1: A at position 1? Then word: A _ _ S _ \nOption 2: A at position 5? Then word: _ _ _ S A\n\nThere is also the possibility? that A is at position 1 and we have a letter at position 5? Or A at position 5 and we have a letter at position 1? \n\nNow, we should choose a word that tests? Where we put A? If we put A at one of them? then the feedback will tell? \n\nBut note: if A is not at the position we guess? we get '-'? but we know? Or if we get ✓? then it's there? \n\nI think we need to choose a word that covers one scenario? \n\nFor instance? let's assume if we put A at position 1? then:\n  If the secret word has A at position 1? we get ✓? Then we know? And if not? we get '-'? meaning it must be at position 5? \n\nSimilarly? if we put A at position 5? \n  If ✓? then A at 5? \n  If '-'? then A must be at position 1? \n\nSo there's no harm? and we can use? that? \n\nBut we can then pick a word that tests? multiple letters? \n\nSo let's try to find words: \n\nCase 1: Word with A at position 1? Pattern: A _ _ S _ \n  Examples: ANTSY? But we already tried ANTSY? No? We didn't? We considered? ANTSY: A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5? that works? And avoids eliminated letters? \n\nCase 2: Word with A at position 5? Pattern: _ _ _ S A? \n  Words: MANSA? Not common? \n  Words: AROSA? Not English? \n  Words: VISTA? VISTA? Positions: V1? I2? S3? T4? A5? But I2: I is eliminated? So invalid? \n  Words: PATSA? Not a word? \n  Words: SATSA? No? \n  Words: LATSA? No? \n  Words: DATSA? No? \n  Words: HATSA? No? \n  Words: JATS? 4 letters? \n  Words: Yacks? But E? \n  Conclusion: it is hard to find English words that end with SA and are 5 letters? that do not contain the eliminated letters? We exclude R,I,E,C,H,M? \n\nTherefore? we choose ANTSY? \n\nANTSY: \n  It has A at position 1? \n  Letters: A, N, T, S, Y? which are allowed? \n\nBut wait? ANTSY: \n  We haven't tested N, T, Y? \n\nFeedback will tell us? \n  If A is at position 1? then ✓? \n  If not? we get '-'? meaning A exists? but not here? but we already know? So no new information? And then? the other positions? \n\nBut if we get A at position 1: ✓? Then we know? \n  The word: A _ _ S _ \n  and then from ANTSY? we get? \n  Position 2: N? new? \n  Position 3: T? new? \n  Position 5: Y? new? \n\nAnd then? we have to deduce? \n\nBut if A is not at position 1? then in ANTSY? \n  Position 1: A? will be '-'? meaning? A is present? but not here? then we know? A must be at position 5? \n\nSo? we gain information? \n\nTherefore? I think ANTSY? is the next best guess? \n\nAlternatively? we can design? to test both? \n\nBut ANTSY: we are testing position 1: A? And if accepted? then we know? And if not? we know A is at position 5? \n\nAlso? we test new letters? \n\nBut note: the letter S? at position4? we already know? so ✓? \n\nPotential drawback: \n  If the word has A at position 5? and we guess ANTSY? which has A at position 1? and gets '-'? Then we know A should be at position 5? Then the word pattern? becomes: _ _ _ S A? \n\nThen we have to guess? And we have an extra try? \n\nBut we have 4 tries left? \n\nSo we go with ANTSY? \n\nAfter the feedback, we will know more? \n\nSo: \n\n<guess>ANTSY</guess>\n\nBut let me think: \n\nAnother candidate: what about PLANE? But for PLANE: P L A N E? \nBut E is eliminated? so invalid? \n\nTOAST? O and A? But TOAST: T1 O2 A3 S4 T5? \nBut S4? is correct? \nBut A3: but we already tried A at position3? and got '-', meaning? not at position3? \nBut here? we are putting A at position3? again? So feedback? It would be '-' again? \nBut no new information? \nAlso? does not test position1? \n\nSimilarly? SALTS? S at position1? But word: S A L T S? \nBut S is duplicated? \nAlso? A at position2? excluded? because first feedback? So we know? position2 is not A? \nTherefore? SALTS: \n  Position1: S? but secret word: position4 is S? So if there's only one S? Then we might get? \n      Position1: S (duplicate? no? if only one S? then? This S? is not at position4? but we get '-'? because S occurs? \n      Then A: at position2? which? we know is not? so '-'? again? \n  And etc? \n\nSo not optimized? \n\nTherefore? I stick with ANTSY? \n\nSo guess: ANTSYBased on the feedback from both guesses:\n- **S is confirmed at position 4** (✓ from RAISE and CHASM).\n- **A is present** but not at positions 2 (from RAISE) or 3 (from CHASM), leaving positions 1 or 5 as possible locations.\n- **Eliminated letters**: R, I, E, C, H, M (marked x in previous feedback).\n\nThe secret word fits the pattern `_ _ _ S _`, with A in position 1 or 5. For the third guess:\n- **ANTSY (A1, N2, T3, S4, Y5)** is chosen because:\n  1. It tests A at position 1 to resolve its location:\n     - If ✓, A is at position 1.\n     - If -, A must be at position 5.\n  2. Uses new high-frequency letters (N, T, Y) to probe unknown positions.\n  3. Avoids eliminated letters and reuses S at its known position (✓ guaranteed).\n  4. Maximizes information gain by clarifying A’s position while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>ANTSY</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: CHASM -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(-) S(✓) M(x)\nGuess 3: ANTSY -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(x) T(x) S(✓) Y(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
  Meaning:
    - R, I, E are absent.
    - A is present but not in position 2.
    - S is present and in position 4.

Guess 2: CHASM -> C(x) H(x) A(-) S(✓) M(x)
  Meaning:
    - C, H, M are absent.
    - A is present but not in position 3 (since we placed it at position 3 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there).
    - S is again confirmed at position 4.

Guess 3: ANTSY -> A(✓) N(x) T(x) S(✓) Y(-)
  Meaning:
    - A is present and in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got '✓').
    - N and T are absent.
    - S is again confirmed at position 4.
    - Y is present but not in position 5.

So now we know:
- The secret word starts with A (position 1) and has S at position 4: so the pattern is A _ _ S _
- The word contains the letter Y, but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 2 or 3).
- The word does not contain: R, I, E, C, H, M, N, T.

We also know that A is present and we have it at position 1, so we don't need to worry about A elsewhere? But note: the word might have more than one A? However, we haven't seen any indication of that, and we have already placed A at position 1 and got a check, so if there were another A, we wouldn't know. But we don't have any feedback suggesting a duplicate A. So we'll assume only one A for now.

Therefore, the secret word is: A _ _ S _ 
With the second and third positions to be filled, and the fifth position to be filled.

We know that Y is present and must be in position 2 or 3.

Also, the absent letters: R, I, E, C, H, M, N, T. So we must avoid these.

What letters are left? We can use: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, and Y (which we know is present).

But we know Y is present, so it must be in the word. And we have two positions to put it: 2 or 3.

We need to form a word that fits: A _ _ S _ 

We also know that the fifth letter cannot be Y (because in ANTSY, Y was at position 5 and we got '-', meaning Y is present but not at position 5). So Y must be in position 2 or 3.

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Starts with A
- Has S at position 4
- Contains Y (in position 2 or 3)
- The fifth letter is not Y (we know) and must be one of the remaining letters.

We also want to test the position of Y and the fifth letter.

Possible words:

Let me think of words that start with A, have S in the fourth position, and contain Y.

Pattern: A _ _ S _ 

The third position is the one before S? So the word is: A X Y S Z? or A Y X S Z? 

But we don't know the order.

Common words: 
  AWFUL? But no S? 
  AWAKE? No S? 
  AYUSH? Not English? 
  ABYSS? But we have S at position4? and then S at position5? 
      ABYSS: A1, B2, Y3, S4, S5? 
      This fits: 
        Position1: A? ✓
        Position4: S? ✓
        And Y at position3? 
        Also, the fifth letter is S? 
      But we have eliminated? We haven't eliminated S? But we know S is at position4? and if there is another S? that's possible? 
      But we haven't tested for duplicate S? 

But note: in our first guess RAISE, we had one S? and it was marked as ✓? meaning at least one S? but there could be more? 

In the feedback for ANTSY? we had S at position4? ✓? and we didn't have a fifth S? so we don't know? 

But in ABYSS? we have Y at position3? and S at position5? 

But we also have B? which is not eliminated? 

But let's check the feedback: 
  We have eliminated: R, I, E, C, H, M, N, T? 
  B is not in that list? so it's allowed? 

But we also have to see if ABYSS is a valid word? Yes, meaning a state of deep distress? 

But note: in ABYSS, the fifth letter is S? and we know that in ANTSY? we had Y at position5? and it was marked as '-'? meaning Y is present? but not at position5? 

In ABYSS? we don't have Y at position5? so that's fine? 

But we have to guess? 

Alternatively? other words? 

  AEGIS? But E is eliminated? 
  ALIAS? But L? and I? I is eliminated? 
  AMASS? M is eliminated? 
  AORTA? O? and R? R is eliminated? 
  APISH? P? and I? I eliminated? 
  AYINS? I? eliminated? 
  AYAH? 4 letters? 
  AYUS? 4 letters? 
  ABYSM? M eliminated? 
  ABYES? E eliminated? 

So ABYSS seems a candidate? 

But we have to consider: the fifth letter? In ABYSS? it's S? 

But we don't know if the secret word has two S? 

Another word: AWFUL? No S? 
  How about AWASH? 
      AWASH: A1, W2, A3, S4, H5? 
      But H is eliminated? and also A at position3? but we have A at position1? and we don't know about duplicate A? 
      But H is eliminated? so invalid? 

Another: ALOES? E and O? E eliminated? 
  ALOHS? Not a word? 
  ALMES? M and E eliminated? 
  ALYSS? Not a word? 

  AURAS? U? and R? R eliminated? 
  AVAST? V? and T? T eliminated? 
  AWAYS? A1, W2, A3, Y4, S5? But S is at position5? we need S at position4? 

  How about: AYESS? A1, Y2, E3, S4, S5? But E eliminated? 

  BARYS? Not starting with A? 

  So ABYSS seems the only common word? 

But wait: what about ""ABYES""? But E is eliminated? 

  ""ADYTA""? Not common? 

  ""AGYAS""? Not a word? 

  ""AKYAS""? Not a word? 

  ""ALAYS""? Not a word? 

  ""ALKYL""? No S? 

  ""ALYSSA""? 6 letters? 

  ""AMYLS""? M eliminated? 

  ""ANSA""? 4 letters?

  ""AYRES""? R? 

  ""AZANS""? Z? 

  ""AZONS""? O? 

  ""AZYGY""? Z? 

So ABYSS is the only common word that fits? 

But let me check: ""ABYSS"" is a valid word? Yes? 

But we have to consider: the feedback we got for Y? 

In ANTSY? we had Y at position5? and got '-'? meaning Y is present? but not at position5? 

In ABYSS? we have Y at position3? which is not position5? so that's fine? 

Also? the fifth letter is S? which is not Y? so that's consistent? 

But we don't know if the secret word has two S? 

We can try ABYSS? 

But note: we have not tested the letter B? 

Alternatively? we can try a word that tests other letters? 

But we have limited options? 

Another word: ""AWAYS""? But S at position5? not 4? 

  How about ""ASKED""? But E? 

  ""ASKEW""? E? 

  ""ASKOS""? O? 

  ""ASKOS"" is a word? meaning a type of jar? 
      ASKOS: A1, S2, K3, O4, S5? 
      But we need S at position4? but here S is at position2 and 5? and position4 is O? 
      So not? 

  ""ASPEN""? E? 

  ""ASPIC""? I? 

  ""ASSET""? E? 

  ""ASSAY"": A1, S2, S3, A4, Y5? 
      But we have A at position1? and then A at position4?

So I think ABYSS is the only common word that fits the pattern? 

But what about ""ALYSSA""? Too long? 

Or ""ABYSM""? M eliminated? 

Therefore? we go with ABYSS? 

But note: we have to consider that the fifth letter might not be S? 

But in ABYSS? we are putting S at position5? 

We don't know if that is correct? 

But we have to guess? 

Alternatively? we can try a word that has Y at position2? and a different fifth letter? 

For example? ""AYAHS""? 
  AYAHS: A1, Y2, A3, H4, S5? 
  But H is eliminated? and S is at position5? not 4? 

  ""AYAYA""? Not a word?

No? 

What about ""ADYTA""?

  But T is eliminated? and we need S at position4? 

  ""AGYAS""? Not a word? 

  ""AKYAS""? Not? 

  ""ALAYS""? Not? 

  ""ALKYL""? No S? 

  ""AMYLS""? M?

      APAYS: A1, P2, A3, Y4, S5?

      But we have A at position1? and then A at position4? 
      And S at position2 and 3?

      So not?

  ""AZOIC"": I? 

  ""AZONS"": O? 

  ""AZOTE"": E? 

  ""AZOTH"": O? 

  ""AZUKI"": I? 

  ""AZURE"": E? 

So I think ABYSS is the only common word? 

Therefore? we guess ABYSS? 

But note: we have to consider that the word might have Y at position2? 

For example? ""AYSEL""? But E? 

  ""AYAHS"": H? 

  ""AYAYA""? Not? 

  ""AYRIE""? E? 

  ""AYSLE""? E? 

  ""AZYME""? E? 

  ""AZYMS"": M? 

  ""ABAYA""? But no S? 

  ""ABAYA"" is a word? but 5 letters? A1, B2, A3, Y4, A5? No S? 

  ""ABYES"": E? 

  ""ABYSS"" is the only one? 

So we go with ABYSS? 

But let me check: is there a word ""AWAYS""? 
  AWAYS: A1, W2, A3, Y4, S5? 
  This has S at position5? not 4? 

  But we need S at position4? 

  So not? 

Therefore? I think ABYSS is the best guess? 

But note: in ABYSS? we have:
  Position1: A? ✓ (we know)
  Position2: B? new? 
  Position3: Y? 
  Position4: S? ✓ 
  Position5: S? 

We know that Y is present? and in ABYSS? we are putting Y at position3? 

If the secret word has Y at position3? then we get ✓? 
If the secret word has Y at position2? then we get '-' for Y at position3? 

But we also have the fifth letter S? 

Now? if the secret word is ABYSS? then we get all? 

But if not? we get feedback? 

But we have only 3 tries left? 

Alternatively? we can try a word that has Y at position2? and a different fifth letter? 

But we don't know any? 

So I think we have to go with ABYSS? 

But let me think: is there a word like ""AULAS""? 
  AULAS: A1, U2, L3, A4, S5? 
  But we need S at position4? and here position4 is A? 

  ""AULOS"": O? 

  ""AUMIL"": I? 

  ""AURAS"": R? 

  ""AUTOS"": O? 

  ""AVOWS"": O? 

  ""AWOLS"": O? 

  ""AXILS"": I? 

  ""AXLES"": E? 

  ""AXONS"": O? 

  ""AYELP"": E? 

  ""AYGRE"": E? 

  ""AYINS"": I? 

  ""AYONT"": O? 

  ""AYRES"": R? 

  ""AZANS"": Z? 

  ""AZLON"": O? 

  ""AZOIC"": I? 

  ""AZONS"": O? 

  ""AZOTE"": E? 

  ""AZOTH"": O? 

  ""AZUKI"": I? 

  ""AZURE"": E? 

  ""ABYSS"" is the only one? 

So we guess ABYSS? 

But note: we have eliminated T? and in ABYSS? there is no T? so that's fine? 

Also? we have eliminated N? and ABYSS has no N? 

So? 

<guess>ABYSS</guess> 

But let me confirm the feedback we would get if the secret word is not ABYSS? 

For example? if the secret word has Y at position2? and the fifth letter is not S? 

But we don't know such a word? 

Perhaps the secret word is ""ASKEW""? but E? 

Or ""ASKED""? E? 

I think we have to go with ABYSS? 

So? 

Final decision: ABYSS
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**:  
  - R, I, E absent (x)  
  - A present but not in position 2 (-)  
  - S correct at position 4 (✓)  
- **Guess 2 (CHASM)**:  
  - C, H, M absent (x)  
  - A present but not in position 3 (-)  
  - S confirmed at position 4 (✓)  
- **Guess 3 (ANTSY)**:  
  - A correct at position 1 (✓)  
  - N, T absent (x)  
  - S confirmed at position 4 (✓)  
  - Y present but not in position 5 (-)  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `A _ _ S _` (A at position 1, S at position 4).  
2. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - A (position 1)  
   - S (position 4)  
   - Y present (must be in position 2 or 3, since it can't be in 5).  
3. **Absent letters**: R, I, E, C, H, M, N, T (cannot appear).  
4. **Remaining possibilities**:  
   - Position 2: Must be a letter that fits `A _ _ S _` and includes Y (in position 2 or 3).  
   - Position 3: Must be Y or another valid letter.  
   - Position 5: Unknown letter (not Y, and not in the absent list).  
   - Valid letters left: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test Y's position**: Since Y must be in position 2 or 3, prioritize a word that places Y in one of these slots.  
- **Probe position 5**: Use a common consonant to test the ending.  
- **Avoid redundant letters**: Eliminated letters (R, I, E, C, H, M, N, T) are forbidden.  
- **Optimal word choice**:  
  - **ABYSS (A1, B2, Y3, S4, S5)** fits perfectly:  
    - Tests Y in position 3.  
    - Tests S in position 5 (possible duplicate S).  
    - Uses B (new, high-probability consonant).  
    - If Y is correct at position 3, we confirm the core structure. If not, Y must be in position 2.  
    - If S is at position 5, we solve the word; if not, we eliminate S as a duplicate.  

### Why ABYSS?
- Covers all constraints: `A _ _ S _` with Y in position 3.  
- Maximizes information: Tests two critical unknowns (Y's position and potential duplicate S).  
- Valid English word (meaning: a deep or bottomless pit).  

<guess>ABYSS</guess>",ABYSS,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
  Meaning:
    - R, I, E are absent.
    - A is present but not in position 2.
    - S is present and in position 4.

Guess 2: CHASM -> C(x) H(x) A(-) S(✓) M(x)
  Meaning:
    - C, H, M are absent.
    - A is present but not in position 3 (since we placed it at position 3 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there).
    - S is again confirmed at position 4.

Guess 3: ANTSY -> A(✓) N(x) T(x) S(✓) Y(-)
  Meaning:
    - A is present and in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got '✓').
    - N and T are absent.
    - S is again confirmed at position 4.
    - Y is present but not in position 5.

So now we know:
- The secret word starts with A (position 1) and has S at position 4: so the pattern is A _ _ S _
- The word contains the letter Y, but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 2 or 3).
- The word does not contain: R, I, E, C, H, M, N, T.

We also know that A is present and we have it at position 1, so we don't need to worry about A elsewhere? But note: the word might have more than one A? However, we haven't seen any indication of that, and we have already placed A at position 1 and got a check, so if there were another A, we wouldn't know. But we don't have any feedback suggesting a duplicate A. So we'll assume only one A for now.

Therefore, the secret word is: A _ _ S _ 
With the second and third positions to be filled, and the fifth position to be filled.

We know that Y is present and must be in position 2 or 3.

Also, the absent letters: R, I, E, C, H, M, N, T. So we must avoid these.

What letters are left? We can use: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, and Y (which we know is present).

But we know Y is present, so it must be in the word. And we have two positions to put it: 2 or 3.

We need to form a word that fits: A _ _ S _ 

We also know that the fifth letter cannot be Y (because in ANTSY, Y was at position 5 and we got '-', meaning Y is present but not at position 5). So Y must be in position 2 or 3.

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Starts with A
- Has S at position 4
- Contains Y (in position 2 or 3)
- The fifth letter is not Y (we know) and must be one of the remaining letters.

We also want to test the position of Y and the fifth letter.

Possible words:

Let me think of words that start with A, have S in the fourth position, and contain Y.

Pattern: A _ _ S _ 

The third position is the one before S? So the word is: A X Y S Z? or A Y X S Z? 

But we don't know the order.

Common words: 
  AWFUL? But no S? 
  AWAKE? No S? 
  AYUSH? Not English? 
  ABYSS? But we have S at position4? and then S at position5? 
      ABYSS: A1, B2, Y3, S4, S5? 
      This fits: 
        Position1: A? ✓
        Position4: S? ✓
        And Y at position3? 
        Also, the fifth letter is S? 
      But we have eliminated? We haven't eliminated S? But we know S is at position4? and if there is another S? that's possible? 
      But we haven't tested for duplicate S? 

But note: in our first guess RAISE, we had one S? and it was marked as ✓? meaning at least one S? but there could be more? 

In the feedback for ANTSY? we had S at position4? ✓? and we didn't have a fifth S? so we don't know? 

But in ABYSS? we have Y at position3? and S at position5? 

But we also have B? which is not eliminated? 

But let's check the feedback: 
  We have eliminated: R, I, E, C, H, M, N, T? 
  B is not in that list? so it's allowed? 

But we also have to see if ABYSS is a valid word? Yes, meaning a state of deep distress? 

But note: in ABYSS, the fifth letter is S? and we know that in ANTSY? we had Y at position5? and it was marked as '-'? meaning Y is present? but not at position5? 

In ABYSS? we don't have Y at position5? so that's fine? 

But we have to guess? 

Alternatively? other words? 

  AEGIS? But E is eliminated? 
  ALIAS? But L? and I? I is eliminated? 
  AMASS? M is eliminated? 
  AORTA? O? and R? R is eliminated? 
  APISH? P? and I? I eliminated? 
  AYINS? I? eliminated? 
  AYAH? 4 letters? 
  AYUS? 4 letters? 
  ABYSM? M eliminated? 
  ABYES? E eliminated? 

So ABYSS seems a candidate? 

But we have to consider: the fifth letter? In ABYSS? it's S? 

But we don't know if the secret word has two S? 

Another word: AWFUL? No S? 
  How about AWASH? 
      AWASH: A1, W2, A3, S4, H5? 
      But H is eliminated? and also A at position3? but we have A at position1? and we don't know about duplicate A? 
      But H is eliminated? so invalid?

  AURAS? U? and R? R eliminated? 
  AVAST? V? and T? T eliminated? 
  AWAYS? A1, W2, A3, Y4, S5? But S is at position5? we need S at position4? 

  How about: AYESS? A1, Y2, E3, S4, S5? But E eliminated? 

  BARYS? Not starting with A? 

  So ABYSS seems the only common word? 

But wait: what about ""ABYES""? But E is eliminated? 

  ""ADYTA""? Not common? 

  ""AGYAS""? Not a word? 

  ""AKYAS""? Not a word?

So ABYSS is the only common word that fits? 

But let me check: ""ABYSS"" is a valid word? Yes? 

But we have to consider: the feedback we got for Y? 

In ANTSY? we had Y at position5? and got '-'? meaning Y is present? but not at position5? 

In ABYSS? we have Y at position3? which is not position5? so that's fine? 

Also? the fifth letter is S? which is not Y? so that's consistent? 

But we don't know if the secret word has two S? 

We can try ABYSS?

  ""ANSA""? 4 letters? 

  ""APAYS""? P? and A? 
      APAYS: A1, P2, A3, Y4, S5? 
      But we need S at position4? but here Y is at position4? and S at position5? 
      So not? 

  ""APPUY""? No S? 

  ""ARAYS""? R? 

  ""ARYLS""? R? 

  ""ASKED""? E? 

  ""ASKEW""? E? 

  ""ASKOS"": O? 

  ""ASPEN""? E? 

  ""ASPIC""? I? 

  ""ASSET""? E? 

  ""ASSAY"": A1, S2, S3, A4, Y5? 
      But we have A at position1? and then A at position4? 
      And S at position2 and 3? 
      But we need S at position4? but position4 is A? 
      So not? 

  ""ASSOT""? O? 

  ""ASWIM""? I? 

  ""ATOKS""? T? 

  ""AUDIO""? I? 

  ""AULOS""? O? 

  ""AUMIL""? I? 

  ""AURAS""? R? 

  ""AURES""? E? 

  ""AUTOS""? O? 

  ""AVISO""? I? 

  ""AVOWS""? O? 

  ""AWASH""? H? 

  ""AWOLS"": O? and S at position5? 

  ""AXILS"": I? 

  ""AXLES"": E? 

  ""AXONS"": O? 

  ""AYELP"": E? 

  ""AYGRE"": E? 

  ""AYINS"": I? 

  ""AYONT"": O? 

  ""AYRES"": R? 

  ""AZANS"": Z? 

  ""AZLON"": O? 

  ""AZOIC"": I? 

  ""AZONS"": O? 

  ""AZOTE"": E? 

  ""AZOTH"": O? 

  ""AZUKI"": I? 

  ""AZURE"": E? 

So I think ABYSS is the only common word? 

Therefore? we guess ABYSS? 

But note: we have to consider that the word might have Y at position2? 

For example? ""AYSEL""? But E? 

  ""AYAHS"": H? 

  ""AYAYA""? Not? 

  ""AYRIE""? E? 

  ""AYSLE""? E? 

  ""AZYME""? E? 

  ""AZYMS"": M? 

  ""ABAYA""? But no S? 

  ""ABAYA"" is a word? but 5 letters? A1, B2, A3, Y4, A5? No S? 

  ""ABYES"": E? 

  ""ABYSS"" is the only one? 

So we go with ABYSS? 

But let me check: is there a word ""AWAYS""? 
  AWAYS: A1, W2, A3, Y4, S5? 
  This has S at position5? not 4? 

  But we need S at position4? 

  So not? 

Therefore? I think ABYSS is the best guess? 

But note: in ABYSS? we have:
  Position1: A? ✓ (we know)
  Position2: B? new? 
  Position3: Y? 
  Position4: S? ✓ 
  Position5: S? 

We know that Y is present? and in ABYSS? we are putting Y at position3? 

If the secret word has Y at position3? then we get ✓? 
If the secret word has Y at position2? then we get '-' for Y at position3? 

But we also have the fifth letter S? 

Now? if the secret word is ABYSS? then we get all? 

But if not? we get feedback? 

But we have only 3 tries left? 

Alternatively? we can try a word that has Y at position2? and a different fifth letter? 

But we don't know any? 

So I think we have to go with ABYSS? 

But let me think: is there a word like ""AULAS""? 
  AULAS: A1, U2, L3, A4, S5? 
  But we need S at position4? and here position4 is A? 

  ""AULOS"": O? 

  ""AUMIL"": I? 

  ""AURAS"": R? 

  ""AUTOS"": O? 

  ""AVOWS"": O? 

  ""AWOLS"": O? 

  ""AXILS"": I? 

  ""AXLES"": E? 

  ""AXONS"": O? 

  ""AYELP"": E? 

  ""AYGRE"": E? 

  ""AYINS"": I? 

  ""AYONT"": O? 

  ""AYRES"": R? 

  ""AZANS"": Z? 

  ""AZLON"": O? 

  ""AZOIC"": I? 

  ""AZONS"": O? 

  ""AZOTE"": E? 

  ""AZOTH"": O? 

  ""AZUKI"": I? 

  ""AZURE"": E? 

  ""ABYSS"" is the only one? 

So we guess ABYSS? 

But note: we have eliminated T? and in ABYSS? there is no T? so that's fine? 

Also? we have eliminated N? and ABYSS has no N? 

So? 

<guess>ABYSS</guess> 

But let me confirm the feedback we would get if the secret word is not ABYSS? 

For example? if the secret word has Y at position2? and the fifth letter is not S? 

But we don't know such a word? 

Perhaps the secret word is ""ASKEW""? but E? 

Or ""ASKED""? E? 

I think we have to go with ABYSS? 

So? 

Final decision: ABYSS### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**:  
  - R, I, E absent (x)  
  - A present but not in position 2 (-)  
  - S correct at position 4 (✓)  
- **Guess 2 (CHASM)**:  
  - C, H, M absent (x)  
  - A present but not in position 3 (-)  
  - S confirmed at position 4 (✓)  
- **Guess 3 (ANTSY)**:  
  - A correct at position 1 (✓)  
  - N, T absent (x)  
  - S confirmed at position 4 (✓)  
  - Y present but not in position 5 (-)  

### Key Insights:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `A _ _ S _` (A at position 1, S at position 4).  
2. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - A (position 1)  
   - S (position 4)  
   - Y present (must be in position 2 or 3, since it can't be in 5).  
3. **Absent letters**: R, I, E, C, H, M, N, T (cannot appear).  
4. **Remaining possibilities**:  
   - Position 2: Must be a letter that fits `A _ _ S _` and includes Y (in position 2 or 3).  
   - Position 3: Must be Y or another valid letter.  
   - Position 5: Unknown letter (not Y, and not in the absent list).  
   - Valid letters left: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test Y's position**: Since Y must be in position 2 or 3, prioritize a word that places Y in one of these slots.  
- **Probe position 5**: Use a common consonant to test the ending.  
- **Avoid redundant letters**: Eliminated letters (R, I, E, C, H, M, N, T) are forbidden.  
- **Optimal word choice**:  
  - **ABYSS (A1, B2, Y3, S4, S5)** fits perfectly:  
    - Tests Y in position 3.  
    - Tests S in position 5 (possible duplicate S).  
    - Uses B (new, high-probability consonant).  
    - If Y is correct at position 3, we confirm the core structure. If not, Y must be in position 2.  
    - If S is at position 5, we solve the word; if not, we eliminate S as a duplicate.  

### Why ABYSS?
- Covers all constraints: `A _ _ S _` with Y in position 3.  
- Maximizes information: Tests two critical unknowns (Y's position and potential duplicate S).  
- Valid English word (meaning: a deep or bottomless pit).",Guess 4: ABYSS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(✓) Y(✓) S(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
