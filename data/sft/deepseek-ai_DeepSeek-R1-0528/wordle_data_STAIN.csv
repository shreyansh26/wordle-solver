We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.

 I'll choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes some of these.

 One popular starting word is ""ROAST"". It has R, O, A, S, T — all common letters.

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also very good.

 But note: we are allowed 6 tries, so we can start with a word that has a good balance.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E — which are all common and it includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so A is the 3rd letter of the secret word)
- N: - (in the word but in the wrong position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The third letter is A.
2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since in ""crane"" it was the fourth and got a minus).
3. The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ A _ _

And it contains the letter N, but not in the fourth position. Also, it does not contain C, R, or E.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has A in the third position (to keep that known)
- Includes the letter N (since we know it's in the word) but not in the fourth position.
- Avoids the letters C, R, E.
- Tries to test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

We also know that the word has 5 letters and is a valid English word.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ _ and contain N (but not as the fourth letter) and without C, R, E.

Possible positions for N: it can be in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 4 is excluded by the feedback and position 3 is A).

We should also try to include other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried yet. We have used C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid those except A and N.

Common letters we haven't used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that has:
- First letter: a new letter (say, S or T or L)
- Second letter: a new letter
- Third letter: A (fixed)
- Fourth letter: a new letter (but not N, because we know N isn't in the fourth position)
- Fifth letter: possibly N or a new letter.

But note: we know N is in the word, so we should include it in the guess to find its position.

So, let's try to include N in a position we haven't tested: either 1, 2, or 5.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

One idea: put N at the beginning? So the word would be N _ A _ _

But we need a valid word. Examples: ""NASTY"", ""NASAL"", ""NAVAL"", etc. But note: we must avoid E, R, C.

""NASTY"": 
- N at position 1 (which we haven't tested)
- S at position 2
- A at 3 (fixed)
- T at 4
- Y at 5

This word avoids C, R, E. Also, we test S, T, Y.

Alternatively, we could put N at the end: _ _ A _ N

Examples: ""PLAIN"", ""TRAIN"" (but T is allowed? wait, we haven't ruled out T, but note: ""TRAIN"" has R which is excluded). We cannot use R.

So, without R: ""PLAIN"", ""AGAIN"", ""CHAIN"" (but C is excluded). 

""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N. This avoids C, R, E. And N is at the end (position 5).

But we also want to test more common letters.

Another option: put N in the second position: _ N A _ _

Examples: ""SNAIL"", ""SNAKY"", ""SNAPS"" (but SNAPS has S twice? no, it's S,N,A,P,S). But we can use S.

""SNAIL"": S, N, A, I, L. This tests S, N, I, L and avoids C, R, E.

We have two good candidates: ""NASTY"" and ""SNAIL"".

But note: in ""NASTY"", we are testing N at position 1 and also S, T, Y. In ""SNAIL"", we test S, N, I, L.

We might also consider ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N. This tests P, L, I, and N at the end.

Which one is better? We want to maximize information.

We know the word has an A in the third position and an N somewhere (not position 4). The word does not have C, R, E.

Common letters we haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

""NASTY"" tests: N (at 1), S (at 2), T (at 4), Y (at 5). And A at 3.

""SNAIL"" tests: S (at 1), N (at 2), A (at 3), I (at 4), L (at 5).

""PLAIN"" tests: P (at 1), L (at 2), A (at 3), I (at 4), N (at 5).

We should avoid using I in the fourth position because in the first guess, the fourth position was N and we got a minus, but that doesn't directly relate to I. However, we are free to test.

But note: we want to avoid the fourth position for N, but we can test other letters there.

I think ""SNAIL"" is a good choice because it tests four new letters (S, I, L) and N in a new position (second). Also, it has two vowels (A and I) and three consonants.

Alternatively, ""NASTY"" tests S, T, Y and N at the start.

But ""SNAIL"" might be better because it uses more common letters? L and I are very common.

We can also consider ""SALON"", but that has O and N at the end, but the pattern is S A L O N, so third letter is L? No, we need third letter to be A. So ""SALON"" would be S (1), A (2), L (3) — but we need A at position 3, so that doesn't work.

Another word: ""MANIA"" — M (1), A (2), N (3) — but we need A at 3, so that's not matching.

So, back to the candidates.

I think I'll go with ""SNAIL"" because it tests S, N, I, L and we know N is in the word so we are testing it in position 2.

But note: in the first guess, we had N in position 4 and it was wrong position. Now we are trying N in position 2. If it gets a minus, then we know N must be in position 1 or 5. If it gets a check, then we know it's in position 2.

Similarly, we test S at position 1, I at 4, L at 5.

So, let's choose ""SNAIL"".

But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? The feedback doesn't indicate that, but it's possible. However, we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't have N in the second position to test other possibilities? But we know N is in the word, so we should try to locate it.

We have three positions to test: 1,2,5. We can test one of them in this guess.

I think ""SNAIL"" is a reasonable choice.

But let me check if there's a word that tests more common letters. Another candidate: ""STAIN"" — S (1), T (2), A (3), I (4), N (5). This tests S, T, I, and N at the end. Also avoids C, R, E.

""STAIN"" is a valid word. It tests T as well, which is very common.

Similarly, ""SWAIN"" but that has W which is less common.

Between ""SNAIL"" and ""STAIN"", I think ""STAIN"" might be better because it tests T and also puts N at the end (position 5) which we haven't tested.

In ""STAIN"":
- S at 1
- T at 2
- A at 3
- I at 4
- N at 5

This way, we test two common letters T and S, and also I and N.

We know N is in the word, so by putting it at the end, if it gets a minus, then we know N must be in position 1 or 2 (but we are testing position 5). If it gets a check, then we know it's at the end.

Similarly, if we get a minus for N, then we know it must be in 1 or 2.

But note: we are also testing S and T at positions 1 and 2.

I think ""STAIN"" is a good choice.

Another option: ""PLAIN"" tests P and L, which are less common than S and T? S and T are more common.

So, I'll go with ""STAIN"".

But wait, we must ensure that we are not using any excluded letters. ""STAIN"" has S, T, A, I, N — no C, R, E. Good.

So, second guess: ""STAIN""

But note: the feedback for the first guess said that N is in the word but not in the fourth position. In ""STAIN"", we are putting N in the fifth position, which is different.

We are also testing I in the fourth position, which was previously occupied by N (which was wrong). That might be good.

So, let's go with ""STAIN"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: x, A: ✓, N: -, E: x), we know:
- The third letter is A (so the word pattern is _ _ A _ _).
- N is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- C, R, and E are not in the word.

For the second guess, I chose ""stain"" because:
- It includes A in the third position (to maintain the known correct letter).
- It tests N in a new position (fifth) to help locate it, since we know N is present but not in the fourth position.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, E).
- It introduces new common letters (S, T, I) to gather more information about the secret word.
