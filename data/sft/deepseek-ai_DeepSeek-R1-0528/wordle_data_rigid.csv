We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in word games often include letters like A, E, I, O, U (vowels) and common consonants such as R, S, T, L, N.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 Another is ""SLATE"". However, let's consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

 According to various sources, the most common letters in English 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 I want to cover as many common letters as possible. The word ""ROATE"" is sometimes used, but let's stick to a more common one.

 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we should avoid using the same words to be safe? 
 But the rules don't say we can't. Actually, we can choose any valid word.

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" as it covers R, A, I, S, E which are all very common.

 But wait, let me check if ""RAISE"" is valid. Yes, it is a valid English word.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also very good: S, L, A, T, E.

 I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it has two of the most common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T).

 So, my first guess is ""SLATE"".

We have the feedback from the first guess: ""slate"" resulted in all 'x's. That means none of the letters S, L, A, T, E are in the secret word.
 We must choose a new guess that does not contain any of these letters: S, L, A, T, E.

 Now, we need to think of common English letters that are not in the set {S, L, A, T, E}. 
 The most common letters in English words (after those) might include O, I, R, N, U, etc.

 We should aim for a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the secret word.

 Let me recall the common starting letters and avoid S, L, A, T, E.

 Considering the frequency, without the letters we've eliminated, we can try:

 Options: 
   Common vowels left: O, U, I (I is also a vowel) 
   Common consonants: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, Y, etc.

 We can form words like ""ROUND"", ""CRIMP"", ""OUIJA"", but ""OUIJA"" is not common and might be considered proper noun? 
 Also, we need a valid 5-letter word.

 Another idea: ""CORNY"" - but let's check if it avoids the forbidden letters: C, O, R, N, Y — none of S,L,A,T,E — so it's okay.

 But we can do better with more common letters? How about ""PRION""? Or ""CRONY""?

 Alternatively, consider ""CHOIR"": C, H, O, I, R — no S,L,A,T,E. It uses common letters and has vowels and consonants.

 But let's see: We don't know how many vowels are in the word, but since we haven't hit any, we might need to try different vowels.

 Since E and A are out, we focus on I, O, U.

 Another candidate: ""OUNCE"": O, U, N, C, E — wait, E is in it! But we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E.

 So avoid E.

 Similarly, avoid A. So no A or E.

 Therefore, we must use other vowels: I, O, U.

 Let me look for words with I and O and common consonants.

 Option: ""GROIN"" — G, R, O, I, N — avoids S,L,A,T,E.

 But G is not the most common. Similarly, ""PRION"" — P, R, I, O, N. That's good.

 But let's think of words with more frequent consonants: R, N, C, H.

 Another word: ""CROWN"" — C, R, O, W, N. Avoids the forbidden letters.

 Or ""BROWN"" — B, R, O, W, N.

 Also, ""FROWN"" — same.

 However, note that we have eliminated 5 letters, so there are 21 letters left. But some are more common.

 Since we have no information yet, we need to maximize new information.

 We can try ""CRIMP"": C, R, I, M, P — that covers several common consonants and a vowel.

 Or ""CHIMP"" — similar.

 But let me check the frequency: R is very common, then N, then others.

 Another idea: ""NYMPH"" — N, Y, M, P, H — but Y is sometimes a vowel, and it's not too common, and the word is rare? Actually, in word games, it's acceptable.

 However, we might prefer more common words. 

 I propose ""CORNY"": C, O, R, N, Y — but Y is a semi-vowel, and it's common. And it avoids the forbidden letters.

 Also, ""ROBIN"" — R, O, B, I, N — avoids the bad letters.

 Or ""RHINO"" — R, H, I, N, O.

 But note that we don't want to reuse positions without knowing? But we have no correct positions known.

 Since we have no feedback, any word that avoids the excluded letters is fine.

 Let me choose a word that covers new vowels and consonants.

 Consider ""ROBIN"":
   R, O, B, I, N

 Or ""CRONY"": 
   C, R, O, N, Y

 I think ""CRONY"" is acceptable.

 But let me see if we can get more coverage: we might try a word with U? Because U is less common, but it could be.

 Alternatively, ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D — includes U and D.

 However, I think ""CRONY"" is a good choice because it covers common letters: C, R, O, N, Y. 

 So I'll go with ""CRONY"".

<guess> crony </guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""slate"", where all letters (S, L, A, T, E) were marked as ""x"" (not in the word at all), we know the secret word does not contain these letters. For the next guess:
- Must exclude S, L, A, T, E
- Should prioritize new common letters to maximize information, targeting vowels like O, I, U and consonants like R, N, C, H

A strong candidate is **""CRONY""** (C, R, O, N, Y). It:
- Uses common letters not yet tested
- Avoids forbidden letters
- Includes vowels (O, Y) and consonants for balanced coverage
- Y acts as a vowel here, ensuring vowel testing continues

This guess may reveal the presence/absence of C, R, O, N, Y and their positions.

- Includes vowels (O, Y) and consonants for balanced coverage
- Y acts as a vowel here, ensuring vowel testing continues

This guess may reveal the presence/absence of C, R, O, N, Y and their positions.

How about ""PRION""? Or ""CRONY""?\n\n Alternatively, consider ""CHOIR"": C, H, O, I, R — no S,L,A,T,E. It uses common letters and has vowels and consonants.\n\n But let\'s see: We don\'t know how many vowels are in the word, but since we haven\'t hit any, we might need to try different vowels.\n\n Since E and A are out, we focus on I, O, U.\n\n Another candidate: ""OUNCE"": O, U, N, C, E — wait, E is in it! But we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E.\n\n So avoid E.\n\n Similarly, avoid A. So no A or E.\n\n Therefore, we must use other vowels: I, O, U.\n\n Let me look for words with I and O and common consonants.\n\n Option: ""GROIN"" — G, R, O, I, N — avoids S,L,A,T,E.\n\n But G is not the most common.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""slate"" -> all letters are absent: S, L, A, T, E are not in the word.
2. ""crony"" -> C(x), R(-), O(x), N(x), Y(x)

From guess 2, we know:
- R is in the word but not in the second position (since it's marked with '-', meaning it's present but in the wrong position).
- C, O, N, Y are not in the word.

So, overall, we know the word does not contain: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y.
And it does contain R, but not in the second position.

We also know that R must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is wrong).

Now, we need to think of a new guess that:
- Does not use any of the excluded letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y.
- Includes the letter R (since we know it's in the word) but not in the second position.
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet and remove the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, C, E, L, N, O, S, T, Y

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z

But we know R is in the word, so we must include R.

Now, common letters from the remaining: R, H, I, M, D, P, U, B, F, G, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common vowels left: I, U (since A, E, O are out, and Y is also out)

So we should try to include I and/or U.

Also, common consonants: R, H, M, D, P, B, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that includes R (not in position 2) and uses letters from the remaining set.

Possible words:

- Let's think of words with R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Since R is in the word but not in position 2, we can try to put R in a different position to test.

We have no information about the other positions, so we can try to put R in position 1, for example.

But we don't know, so we should choose a word that has R and other new letters.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: ""PRIME"" -> but E is excluded, so no.

Option 2: ""DRUID"" -> D, R, U, I, D. But D is repeated? Actually, it's allowed? The rules don't say no repeated letters, but in this case, we don't know if D is in the word or not. But we have two D's? The word ""druid"" has two D's? Let me check: D-R-U-I-D, so positions 1 and 5 are D. But we don't know if D is in the word, so it might be okay, but if the word has only one D, then one of them might be marked wrong. But it's acceptable.

However, we have to avoid E, which we are. But let's see the letters: D, R, U, I, D. We haven't tried D, U, I yet.

But we have two D's, which might not be efficient if D is not in the word. But it's a valid word.

Another option: ""FIGHT"" -> but T is excluded.

T is excluded, so no.

""BRICK"" -> C is excluded.

We must avoid C.

""GRIMY"" -> Y is excluded.

No.

""PRIDE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""FRUIT"" -> F, R, U, I, T -> but T is excluded.

No.

""DRINK"" -> N excluded.

No.

""PRICK"" -> C and K, but C excluded.

We need to avoid the excluded letters.

Let's list available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z

Common ones: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, R, U, W

Now, words with R and some of these.

How about ""HUMOR""? But O is excluded.

No.

""RUMBA"" -> A excluded.

No.

""BUMPH""? Not a common word.

""GUILD"" -> G, U, I, L, D -> but L is excluded! L is in the excluded list.

Excluded: S,L,A,T,E,C,O,N,Y

So L is excluded.

""QUIRK"" -> Q, U, I, R, K. This might work. Letters: Q, U, I, R, K. All are in the available set? Q is less common, but it's possible.

But Q might be too rare. We can try.

""PRIMO"" -> O excluded.

No.

""GRUFF"" -> G, R, U, F, F. Two F's. But F is available.

""GRUFF"" is a word? Yes, meaning surly or rough.

But let's see: G, R, U, F, F. We have R and U, I is not included, but we can try.

Another word: ""DRUMS"" -> S excluded.

No.

""BIRCH"" -> but C is excluded? C is excluded, so no.

""BIRTH"" -> T excluded.

No.

""FIRED"" -> E excluded.

No.

""WIMPY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""PURGE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""BURGH"" -> B, U, R, G, H. This looks good. Letters: B, U, R, G, H. All available.

And R is included. We can put R in position 3? B-U-R-G-H.

""Burgh"" is a word, meaning a borough or town.

But is it common? In word games, it might be accepted.

Another option: ""HUMAN"" -> A and N excluded.

No.

""RUPIA"" -> A excluded.

No.

""QUIPU"" -> Q, U, I, P, U. Two U's? And Q is rare.

""QUIRK"" as I thought earlier: Q, U, I, R, K.

But Q is not very common, so we might avoid.

""PRISM"" -> P, R, I, S, M -> but S is excluded! S is in the excluded list.

Excluded includes S.

So no.

""GRIM"" is 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

""BRING"" -> N excluded.

No.

""FRUIT"" -> T excluded.

No.

""DRIVE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""PRIVY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""VIPER"" -> E excluded.

No.

""RIVER"" -> E excluded and R repeated? But E is the problem.

""RIDER"" -> E excluded.

I'm struggling.

Another idea: ""MOURN"" -> O and N excluded.

No.

""POUND"" -> O and N excluded? O and N are excluded.

No.

""BUDGE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""FUDGE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""JUICE"" -> E excluded and C excluded? C is excluded.

No.

""QUICK"" -> C excluded.

No.

""QUIET"" -> E and T excluded.

No.

""QUILT"" -> T and L excluded.

No.

""GUISE"" -> E and S excluded.

No.

""GUIDE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""BUILD"" -> L excluded.

No.

""DUVET"" -> E and T excluded.

No.

""KRILL"" -> L excluded.

No.

""PRIED"" -> E excluded.

No.

""GRIPE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""TRIPE"" -> T and E excluded.

No.

""BRINE"" -> E and N excluded.

No.

""CRIME"" -> C and E excluded.

No.

I need to think differently. Let's list words that start with R, since R might be in position 1.

For example, ""R"" in position 1, then the next letters from available.

Position 1: R
Position 2: cannot be R (but we don't know if repetition is allowed, but typically words can have repeated letters? The rules don't say, but in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. However, in this case, we don't have any repeated letters yet, and we don't know if the secret word has repeats. But to be safe, we should avoid repeating letters in our guess to maximize information, unless necessary.

But in this case, we don't have R in the word yet except we know one R, so we can have R only once in the guess.

So position 1: R, then position 2: must be from available letters, not the excluded ones.

Available for position 2: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

But we want common letters.

For example, ""R"" + vowel? Vowels available: I, U.

So ""RI..."" or ""RU...""

""RICE"" -> C excluded.

""RIDE"" -> E excluded.

""RIFE"" -> E excluded.

""RIME"" -> E excluded.

""RIPE"" -> E excluded.

""RISE"" -> E and S excluded.

""RIVE"" -> E excluded and only 4 letters.

""RIGID"" -> R, I, G, I, D. Two I's. But I is available. ""RIGID"" has two I's? R-I-G-I-D, so positions 2 and 4 are I. That's a possibility.

Letters: R, I, G, I, D. We have R and I, and G and D.

But we have two I's, which might not be ideal if the word has only one I, but it's acceptable.

Another word: ""RUMBA"" -> A excluded.

No.

""RUMOR"" -> O excluded.

No.

""RUDDY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""RUGBY"" -> G, B, Y -> Y excluded.

No.

""RUPEE"" -> E excluded and P? But E is the problem.

""RUBLE"" -> E and L excluded.

No.

""RIFLE"" -> E and L excluded.

No.

""RIFTY"" -> T and Y excluded.

No.

""RIPEN"" -> E and N excluded.

No.

Perhaps R in position 3.

For example, words with R in position 3.

Like, _ _ R _ _

But we need to fill the blanks.

For instance, ""B"" + ""U"" + ""R"" + ""G"" + ""H"" -> ""BURGH"" as I thought earlier.

""BURGH"" is a valid word.

Another one: ""H"" + ""U"" + ""R"" + ""R"" + something? But we don't want to repeat R unless necessary.

"" HURRY"" -> but Y excluded.

No.

""PURIM"" -> P, U, R, I, M. This is a valid word, a Jewish holiday.

Letters: P, U, R, I, M. All available.

And no repeats.

This seems good.

""PURIM"": P, U, R, I, M.

R is in position 3, which is different from position 2 in the previous guess (where R was in position 2 and was wrong, so now in position 3 it might be correct or wrong, but we don't know).

We also get to test P, U, I, M.

Another option: ""MURKY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""FUROR"" -> O excluded.

No.

""GUIRO"" -> O excluded and G, U, I, R, O -> O is excluded.

No.

""QUIRK"" -> Q, U, I, R, K. Q is rare, but let's consider.

I think ""PURIM"" is better because it uses more common letters except P and M are not the most common, but they are available.

Another word: ""BRISK"" -> but S excluded.

No.

""PRICK"" -> C excluded.

No.

""DRINK"" -> N excluded.

No.

""GRIND"" -> N excluded? N is excluded, so no.

""URBAN"" -> A and N excluded.

No.

""URBEX""? Not a word.

""UMBER"" -> E excluded.

No.

""UMBRA"" -> A excluded.

No.

""DUMPY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""HUMPH"" -> H, U, M, P, H. Two H's. ""HUMPH"" is a word, an expression.

Letters: H, U, M, P, H. We have H, U, M, P.

But two H's, which might be less efficient.

""PUMPH"" not a word.

I think ""PURIM"" is a reasonable choice.

""GUIMP"" not a word.

""PRIMI"" not common.

""VIRUS"" -> S excluded.

No.

""VIRAL"" -> L excluded.

No.

""BIRDS"" -> S excluded.

No.

""FIRTH"" -> T and H, but T excluded.

No.

""WORLD"" -> O and L excluded.

No.

""WORDY"" -> O and Y excluded.

No.

""WORMY"" -> O and Y excluded.

No.

""FORMY"" not a word.

I think ""PURIM"" or ""BURGH"" are options.

But ""BURGH"" has the letter G and H, which are good.

""PURIM"" has I, which is a vowel.

Since we have no vowels except U and I available, we should test both if possible.

In ""PURIM"", we have U and I.

In ""BURGH"", we have U.

So ""PURIM"" tests two vowels.

Also, R is in position 3.

Previous guess ""crony"" had R in position 2, which was wrong. Now we put R in position 3 to test.

So I think ""PURIM"" is a good guess.

Let me confirm if ""PURIM"" is acceptable. It is a proper noun? But in word games, it is often accepted as a common noun for the holiday.

To be safe, we can choose another word.

""GRUMP"" -> G, R, U, M, P. This is a word, meaning to be grumpy.

Letters: G, R, U, M, P. All available, no repeats.

R is in position 2? G-R-U-M-P, so R in position 2.

But in the previous guess, ""crony"" had R in position 2 and it was wrong (marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position). So if we put R in position 2 again, it will still be wrong, but we already know that. So it doesn't give new information about position.

In fact, it might be better to put R in a different position to test where it might be.

In ""crony"", R was in position 2 and wrong, so the correct position is not 2. So we should try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

In ""GRUMP"", R is in position 2, which we know is wrong, so the feedback will show R as '-' again, and we don't learn the position.

Whereas if we put R in position 3, like in ""PURIM"", we might get a different feedback.

Similarly, in ""BURGH"", R is in position 3.

So both ""PURIM"" and ""BURGH"" have R in position 3.

""BURGH"": B-U-R-G-H, R in position 3.

""PURIM"": P-U-R-I-M, R in position 3.

Now, between these, ""PURIM"" has I, which is a vowel we haven't tested, while ""BURGH"" has no I, but has G and H.

Since we haven't tested I at all, it might be better to include I.

Also, U is in both.

So I think ""PURIM"" is slightly better.

Another word: ""QUIRM"" not a word.

""PRIMU"" not a word.

So I'll go with ""PURIM"".

But let's see if there's a word with R in position 1.

For example, ""RIPED"" not a word.

""RIVED"" -> E excluded.

""RIGOL"" -> L excluded.

""RIGOR"" -> O excluded.

""RIDER"" -> E excluded.

""RUDER"" -> E excluded.

""RUMEN"" -> E and N excluded.

No.

""RUMPS"" -> S excluded.

No.

""RUMPY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""RUBIN"" -> N excluded.

No.

""RUBIO"" -> O excluded.

No.

""RUBUS"" -> S excluded.

No.

""RUDDY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""RUDDS"" -> S and D repeated? ""rudds"" not common.

I think it's hard to find a word with R in position 1 without using excluded letters.

So ""PURIM"" or ""BURGH"" are fine.

I choose ""PURIM"".

<guess>purim</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- Guess 1 (""slate""): All letters (S, L, A, T, E) are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- Guess 2 (""crony""): Only R is present but in the wrong position (marked ""-"" for R, ""x"" for C, O, N, Y).

### Key Insights:
1. **Excluded letters (not in the word)**: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y (9 letters total).
2. **Confirmed present letter**: R is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""crony"" feedback).
3. **Remaining letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z.
4. **Strategy for next guess**:
   - Must include R (since it's confirmed present), but not in position 2.
   - Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., vowels I, U and consonants like M, P, H) to maximize information.
   - Avoid all excluded letters and position R correctly (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
   - Ideal guess should cover untested vowels (I, U) to check for additional vowel presence.

After evaluating possible words, **""PURIM""** (a valid English word referring to a Jewish holiday) is selected because:
- It includes R in position 3 (testing a new position).
- It covers two untested vowels (U and I) and two new consonants (P and M).
- All letters (P, U, R, I, M) are from the remaining set and avoid excluded letters.
- No letters are repeated, increasing information gain potential.

This guess will help identify if U, I, P, or M are in the word, and whether R is correctly placed in position 3.

<guess>purim</guess>",purim,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""slate"" -> all letters are absent: S, L, A, T, E are not in the word.
2. ""crony"" -> C(x), R(-), O(x), N(x), Y(x)

From guess 2, we know:
- R is in the word but not in the second position (since it's marked with '-', meaning it's present but in the wrong position).
- C, O, N, Y are not in the word.

So, overall, we know the word does not contain: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y.
And it does contain R, but not in the second position.

We also know that R must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is wrong).

Now, we need to think of a new guess that:
- Does not use any of the excluded letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y.
- Includes the letter R (since we know it's in the word) but not in the second position.
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet and remove the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, C, E, L, N, O, S, T, Y

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z

But we know R is in the word, so we must include R.

Now, common letters from the remaining: R, H, I, M, D, P, U, B, F, G, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common vowels left: I, U (since A, E, O are out, and Y is also out)

So we should try to include I and/or U.

Also, common consonants: R, H, M, D, P, B, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that includes R (not in position 2) and uses letters from the remaining set.

Possible words:

- Let's think of words with R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Since R is in the word but not in position 2, we can try to put R in a different position to test.

We have no information about the other positions, so we can try to put R in position 1, for example.

But we don't know, so we should choose a word that has R and other new letters.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: ""PRIME"" -> but E is excluded, so no.

Option 2: ""DRUID"" -> D, R, U, I, D. But D is repeated? Actually, it's allowed? The rules don't say no repeated letters, but in this case, we don't know if D is in the word or not. But we have two D's? The word ""druid"" has two D's? Let me check: D-R-U-I-D, so positions 1 and 5 are D. But we don't know if D is in the word, so it might be okay, but if the word has only one D, then one of them might be marked wrong. But it's acceptable.

However, we have to avoid E, which we are. But let's see the letters: D, R, U, I, D. We haven't tried D, U, I yet.

But we have two D's, which might not be efficient if D is not in the word. But it's a valid word.

Another option: ""FIGHT"" -> but T is excluded.

T is excluded, so no.

""BRICK"" -> C is excluded.

We must avoid C.

""GRIMY"" -> Y is excluded.

No.

""PRIDE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""FRUIT"" -> F, R, U, I, T -> but T is excluded.

No.

""DRINK"" -> N excluded.

No.

""PRICK"" -> C and K, but C excluded.

We need to avoid the excluded letters.

Let's list available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z

Common ones: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, R, U, W

Now, words with R and some of these.

How about ""HUMOR""? But O is excluded.

No.

""RUMBA"" -> A excluded.

No.

""BUMPH""? Not a common word.

""GUILD"" -> G, U, I, L, D -> but L is excluded! L is in the excluded list.

Excluded: S,L,A,T,E,C,O,N,Y

So L is excluded.

""QUIRK"" -> Q, U, I, R, K. This might work. Letters: Q, U, I, R, K. All are in the available set? Q is less common, but it's possible.

But Q might be too rare. We can try.

""PRIMO"" -> O excluded.

No.

""GRUFF"" -> G, R, U, F, F. Two F's. But F is available.

""GRUFF"" is a word? Yes, meaning surly or rough.

But let's see: G, R, U, F, F. We have R and U, I is not included, but we can try.

Another word: ""DRUMS"" -> S excluded.

No.

""BIRCH"" -> but C is excluded? C is excluded, so no.

""BIRTH"" -> T excluded.

No.

""FIRED"" -> E excluded.

No.

""WIMPY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""PURGE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""BURGH"" -> B, U, R, G, H. This looks good. Letters: B, U, R, G, H. All available.

And R is included. We can put R in position 3? B-U-R-G-H.

""Burgh"" is a word, meaning a borough or town.

But is it common? In word games, it might be accepted.

Another option: ""HUMAN"" -> A and N excluded.

No.

""RUPIA"" -> A excluded.

No.

""QUIPU"" -> Q, U, I, P, U. Two U's? And Q is rare.

""QUIRK"" as I thought earlier: Q, U, I, R, K.

But Q is not very common, so we might avoid.

""PRISM"" -> P, R, I, S, M -> but S is excluded! S is in the excluded list.

Excluded includes S.

So no.

""GRIM"" is 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

""BRING"" -> N excluded.

No.

""FRUIT"" -> T excluded.

No.

""DRIVE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""PRIVY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""VIPER"" -> E excluded.

No.

""RIVER"" -> E excluded and R repeated? But E is the problem.

""RIDER"" -> E excluded.

I'm struggling.

Another idea: ""MOURN"" -> O and N excluded.

No.

""POUND"" -> O and N excluded? O and N are excluded.

No.

""BUDGE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""FUDGE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""JUICE"" -> E excluded and C excluded? C is excluded.

No.

""QUICK"" -> C excluded.

No.

""QUIET"" -> E and T excluded.

No.

""QUILT"" -> T and L excluded.

No.

""GUISE"" -> E and S excluded.

No.

""GUIDE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""BUILD"" -> L excluded.

No.

""DUVET"" -> E and T excluded.

No.

""KRILL"" -> L excluded.

No.

""PRIED"" -> E excluded.

No.

""GRIPE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""TRIPE"" -> T and E excluded.

No.

""BRINE"" -> E and N excluded.

No.

""CRIME"" -> C and E excluded.

No.

I need to think differently. Let's list words that start with R, since R might be in position 1.

For example, ""R"" in position 1, then the next letters from available.

Position 1: R
Position 2: cannot be R (but we don't know if repetition is allowed, but typically words can have repeated letters? The rules don't say, but in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. However, in this case, we don't have any repeated letters yet, and we don't know if the secret word has repeats. But to be safe, we should avoid repeating letters in our guess to maximize information, unless necessary.

But in this case, we don't have R in the word yet except we know one R, so we can have R only once in the guess.

So position 1: R, then position 2: must be from available letters, not the excluded ones.

Available for position 2: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

But we want common letters.

For example, ""R"" + vowel? Vowels available: I, U.

So ""RI..."" or ""RU...""

""RICE"" -> C excluded.

""RIDE"" -> E excluded.

""RIFE"" -> E excluded.

""RIME"" -> E excluded.

""RIPE"" -> E excluded.

""RISE"" -> E and S excluded.

""RIVE"" -> E excluded and only 4 letters.

""RIGID"" -> R, I, G, I, D. Two I's. But I is available. ""RIGID"" has two I's? R-I-G-I-D, so positions 2 and 4 are I. That's a possibility.

Letters: R, I, G, I, D. We have R and I, and G and D.

But we have two I's, which might not be ideal if the word has only one I, but it's acceptable.

Another word: ""RUMBA"" -> A excluded.

No.

""RUMOR"" -> O excluded.

No.

""RUDDY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""RUGBY"" -> G, B, Y -> Y excluded.

No.

""RUPEE"" -> E excluded and P? But E is the problem.

""RUBLE"" -> E and L excluded.

No.

""RIFLE"" -> E and L excluded.

No.

""RIFTY"" -> T and Y excluded.

No.

""RIPEN"" -> E and N excluded.

No.

Perhaps R in position 3.

For example, words with R in position 3.

Like, _ _ R _ _

But we need to fill the blanks.

For instance, ""B"" + ""U"" + ""R"" + ""G"" + ""H"" -> ""BURGH"" as I thought earlier.

""BURGH"" is a valid word.

Another one: ""H"" + ""U"" + ""R"" + ""R"" + something? But we don't want to repeat R unless necessary.

"" HURRY"" -> but Y excluded.

No.

""PURIM"" -> P, U, R, I, M. This is a valid word, a Jewish holiday.

Letters: P, U, R, I, M. All available.

And no repeats.

This seems good.

""PURIM"": P, U, R, I, M.

R is in position 3, which is different from position 2 in the previous guess (where R was in position 2 and was wrong, so now in position 3 it might be correct or wrong, but we don't know).

We also get to test P, U, I, M.

Another option: ""MURKY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""FUROR"" -> O excluded.

No.

""GUIRO"" -> O excluded and G, U, I, R, O -> O is excluded.

No.

""QUIRK"" -> Q, U, I, R, K. Q is rare, but let's consider.

I think ""PURIM"" is better because it uses more common letters except P and M are not the most common, but they are available.

Another word: ""BRISK"" -> but S excluded.

No.

""PRICK"" -> C excluded.

No.

""DRINK"" -> N excluded.

No.

""GRIND"" -> N excluded? N is excluded, so no.

""URBAN"" -> A and N excluded.

No.

""URBEX""? Not a word.

""UMBER"" -> E excluded.

No.

""UMBRA"" -> A excluded.

No.

""DUMPY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""HUMPH"" -> H, U, M, P, H. Two H's. ""HUMPH"" is a word, an expression.

Letters: H, U, M, P, H. We have H, U, M, P.

But two H's, which might be less efficient.

""PUMPH"" not a word.

I think ""PURIM"" is a reasonable choice.

""GUIMP"" not a word.

""PRIMI"" not common.

""VIRUS"" -> S excluded.

No.

""VIRAL"" -> L excluded.

No.

""BIRDS"" -> S excluded.

No.

""FIRTH"" -> T and H, but T excluded.

No.

""WORLD"" -> O and L excluded.

No.

""WORDY"" -> O and Y excluded.

No.

""WORMY"" -> O and Y excluded.

No.

""FORMY"" not a word.

I think ""PURIM"" or ""BURGH"" are options.

But ""BURGH"" has the letter G and H, which are good.

""PURIM"" has I, which is a vowel.

Since we have no vowels except U and I available, we should test both if possible.

In ""PURIM"", we have U and I.

In ""BURGH"", we have U.

So ""PURIM"" tests two vowels.

Also, R is in position 3.

Previous guess ""crony"" had R in position 2, which was wrong. Now we put R in position 3 to test.

So I think ""PURIM"" is a good guess.

Let me confirm if ""PURIM"" is acceptable. It is a proper noun? But in word games, it is often accepted as a common noun for the holiday.

To be safe, we can choose another word.

""GRUMP"" -> G, R, U, M, P. This is a word, meaning to be grumpy.

Letters: G, R, U, M, P. All available, no repeats.

R is in position 2? G-R-U-M-P, so R in position 2.

But in the previous guess, ""crony"" had R in position 2 and it was wrong (marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position). So if we put R in position 2 again, it will still be wrong, but we already know that. So it doesn't give new information about position.

In fact, it might be better to put R in a different position to test where it might be.

In ""crony"", R was in position 2 and wrong, so the correct position is not 2. So we should try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

In ""GRUMP"", R is in position 2, which we know is wrong, so the feedback will show R as '-' again, and we don't learn the position.

Whereas if we put R in position 3, like in ""PURIM"", we might get a different feedback.

Similarly, in ""BURGH"", R is in position 3.

So both ""PURIM"" and ""BURGH"" have R in position 3.

""BURGH"": B-U-R-G-H, R in position 3.

""PURIM"": P-U-R-I-M, R in position 3.

Now, between these, ""PURIM"" has I, which is a vowel we haven't tested, while ""BURGH"" has no I, but has G and H.

Since we haven't tested I at all, it might be better to include I.

Also, U is in both.

So I think ""PURIM"" is slightly better.

Another word: ""QUIRM"" not a word.

""PRIMU"" not a word.

So I'll go with ""PURIM"".

But let's see if there's a word with R in position 1.

For example, ""RIPED"" not a word.

""RIVED"" -> E excluded.

""RIGOL"" -> L excluded.

""RIGOR"" -> O excluded.

""RIDER"" -> E excluded.

""RUDER"" -> E excluded.

""RUMEN"" -> E and N excluded.

No.

""RUMPS"" -> S excluded.

No.

""RUMPY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""RUBIN"" -> N excluded.

No.

""RUBIO"" -> O excluded.

No.

""RUBUS"" -> S excluded.

No.

""RUDDY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""RUDDS"" -> S and D repeated? ""rudds"" not common.

I think it's hard to find a word with R in position 1 without using excluded letters.

So ""PURIM"" or ""BURGH"" are fine.

I choose ""PURIM"".

<guess>purim</guess>Based on the feedback:
- Guess 1 (""slate""): All letters (S, L, A, T, E) are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- Guess 2 (""crony""): Only R is present but in the wrong position (marked ""-"" for R, ""x"" for C, O, N, Y).

### Key Insights:
1. **Excluded letters (not in the word)**: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y (9 letters total).
2. **Confirmed present letter**: R is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""crony"" feedback).
3. **Remaining letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z.
4. **Strategy for next guess**:
   - Must include R (since it's confirmed present), but not in position 2.
   - Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., vowels I, U and consonants like M, P, H) to maximize information.
   - Avoid all excluded letters and position R correctly (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
   - Ideal guess should cover untested vowels (I, U) to check for additional vowel presence.

After evaluating possible words, **""PURIM""** (a valid English word referring to a Jewish holiday) is selected because:
- It includes R in position 3 (testing a new position).
- It covers two untested vowels (U and I) and two new consonants (P and M).
- All letters (P, U, R, I, M) are from the remaining set and avoid excluded letters.
- No letters are repeated, increasing information gain potential.

This guess will help identify if U, I, P, or M are in the word, and whether R is correctly placed in position 3.",Guess 3: purim -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(x) R(-) I(✓) M(x),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in word games often include letters like A, E, I, O, U (vowels) and common consonants such as R, S, T, L, N.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 Another is ""SLATE"". However, let's consider the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

 According to various sources, the most common letters in English 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 I want to cover as many common letters as possible. The word ""ROATE"" is sometimes used, but let's stick to a more common one.

 Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we should avoid using the same words to be safe? 
 But the rules don't say we can't. Actually, we can choose any valid word.

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" as it covers R, A, I, S, E which are all very common.

 But wait, let me check if ""RAISE"" is valid. Yes, it is a valid English word.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also very good: S, L, A, T, E.

 I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it has two of the most common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T).

 So, my first guess is ""SLATE"".

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from the first guess: ""slate"" resulted in all 'x's. That means none of the letters S, L, A, T, E are in the secret word.
 We must choose a new guess that does not contain any of these letters: S, L, A, T, E.

 Now, we need to think of common English letters that are not in the set {S, L, A, T, E}. 
 The most common letters in English words (after those) might include O, I, R, N, U, etc.

 We should aim for a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the secret word.

 Let me recall the common starting letters and avoid S, L, A, T, E.

 Considering the frequency, without the letters we've eliminated, we can try:

 Options: 
   Common vowels left: O, U, I (I is also a vowel) 
   Common consonants: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, Y, etc.

 We can form words like ""ROUND"", ""CRIMP"", ""OUIJA"", but ""OUIJA"" is not common and might be considered proper noun? 
 Also, we need a valid 5-letter word.

 Another idea: ""CORNY"" - but let's check if it avoids the forbidden letters: C, O, R, N, Y — none of S,L,A,T,E — so it's okay.

 But we can do better with more common letters? How about ""PRION""? Or ""CRONY""?

 Alternatively, consider ""CHOIR"": C, H, O, I, R — no S,L,A,T,E. It uses common letters and has vowels and consonants.

 But let's see: We don't know how many vowels are in the word, but since we haven't hit any, we might need to try different vowels.

 Since E and A are out, we focus on I, O, U.

 Another candidate: ""OUNCE"": O, U, N, C, E — wait, E is in it! But we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E.

 So avoid E.

 Similarly, avoid A. So no A or E.

 Therefore, we must use other vowels: I, O, U.

 Let me look for words with I and O and common consonants.

 Option: ""GROIN"" — G, R, O, I, N — avoids S,L,A,T,E.

 But G is not the most common. Similarly, ""PRION"" — P, R, I, O, N. That's good.

 But let's think of words with more frequent consonants: R, N, C, H.

 Another word: ""CROWN"" — C, R, O, W, N. Avoids the forbidden letters.

 Or ""BROWN"" — B, R, O, W, N.

 Also, ""FROWN"" — same.

 However, note that we have eliminated 5 letters, so there are 21 letters left. But some are more common.

 Since we have no information yet, we need to maximize new information.

 We can try ""CRIMP"": C, R, I, M, P — that covers several common consonants and a vowel.

 Or ""CHIMP"" — similar.

 But let me check the frequency: R is very common, then N, then others.

 Another idea: ""NYMPH"" — N, Y, M, P, H — but Y is sometimes a vowel, and it's not too common, and the word is rare? Actually, in word games, it's acceptable.

 However, we might prefer more common words. 

 I propose ""CORNY"": C, O, R, N, Y — but Y is a semi-vowel, and it's common. And it avoids the forbidden letters.

 Also, ""ROBIN"" — R, O, B, I, N — avoids the bad letters.

 Or ""RHINO"" — R, H, I, N, O.

 But note that we don't want to reuse positions without knowing? But we have no correct positions known.

 Since we have no feedback, any word that avoids the excluded letters is fine.

 Let me choose a word that covers new vowels and consonants.

 Consider ""ROBIN"":
   R, O, B, I, N

 Or ""CRONY"": 
   C, R, O, N, Y

 I think ""CRONY"" is acceptable.

 But let me see if we can get more coverage: we might try a word with U? Because U is less common, but it could be.

 Alternatively, ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D — includes U and D.

 However, I think ""CRONY"" is a good choice because it covers common letters: C, R, O, N, Y. 

 So I'll go with ""CRONY"".

<guess> crony </guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""slate"", where all letters (S, L, A, T, E) were marked as ""x"" (not in the word at all), we know the secret word does not contain these letters. For the next guess:
- Must exclude S, L, A, T, E
- Should prioritize new common letters to maximize information, targeting vowels like O, I, U and consonants like R, N, C, H

A strong candidate is **""CRONY""** (C, R, O, N, Y). It:
- Uses common letters not yet tested
- Avoids forbidden letters
- Includes vowels (O, Y) and consonants for balanced coverage
- Y acts as a vowel here, ensuring vowel testing continues

This guess may reveal the presence/absence of C, R, O, N, Y and their positions.

<guess>crony</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: crony -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(x) N(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""slate"" -> all letters are absent: S, L, A, T, E are not in the word.
2. ""crony"" -> C(x), R(-), O(x), N(x), Y(x)

From guess 2, we know:
- R is in the word but not in the second position (since it's marked with '-', meaning it's present but in the wrong position).
- C, O, N, Y are not in the word.

So, overall, we know the word does not contain: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y.
And it does contain R, but not in the second position.

We also know that R must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is wrong).

Now, we need to think of a new guess that:
- Does not use any of the excluded letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y.
- Includes the letter R (since we know it's in the word) but not in the second position.
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

What letters are left? Let's list the alphabet and remove the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, C, E, L, N, O, S, T, Y

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z

But we know R is in the word, so we must include R.

Now, common letters from the remaining: R, H, I, M, D, P, U, B, F, G, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common vowels left: I, U (since A, E, O are out, and Y is also out)

So we should try to include I and/or U.

Also, common consonants: R, H, M, D, P, B, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that includes R (not in position 2) and uses letters from the remaining set.

Possible words:

- Let's think of words with R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Since R is in the word but not in position 2, we can try to put R in a different position to test.

We have no information about the other positions, so we can try to put R in position 1, for example.

But we don't know, so we should choose a word that has R and other new letters.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: ""PRIME"" -> but E is excluded, so no.

Option 2: ""DRUID"" -> D, R, U, I, D. But D is repeated? Actually, it's allowed? The rules don't say no repeated letters, but in this case, we don't know if D is in the word or not. But we have two D's? The word ""druid"" has two D's? Let me check: D-R-U-I-D, so positions 1 and 5 are D. But we don't know if D is in the word, so it might be okay, but if the word has only one D, then one of them might be marked wrong. But it's acceptable.

However, we have to avoid E, which we are. But let's see the letters: D, R, U, I, D. We haven't tried D, U, I yet.

But we have two D's, which might not be efficient if D is not in the word. But it's a valid word.

Another option: ""FIGHT"" -> but T is excluded.

T is excluded, so no.

""BRICK"" -> C is excluded.

We must avoid C.

""GRIMY"" -> Y is excluded.

No.

""PRIDE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""FRUIT"" -> F, R, U, I, T -> but T is excluded.

No.

""DRINK"" -> N excluded.

No.

""PRICK"" -> C and K, but C excluded.

We need to avoid the excluded letters.

Let's list available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z

Common ones: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, R, U, W

Now, words with R and some of these.

How about ""HUMOR""? But O is excluded.

No.

""RUMBA"" -> A excluded.

No.

""BUMPH""? Not a common word.

""GUILD"" -> G, U, I, L, D -> but L is excluded! L is in the excluded list.

Excluded: S,L,A,T,E,C,O,N,Y

So L is excluded.

""QUIRK"" -> Q, U, I, R, K. This might work. Letters: Q, U, I, R, K. All are in the available set? Q is less common, but it's possible.

But Q might be too rare. We can try.

""PRIMO"" -> O excluded.

No.

""GRUFF"" -> G, R, U, F, F. Two F's. But F is available.

""GRUFF"" is a word? Yes, meaning surly or rough.

But let's see: G, R, U, F, F. We have R and U, I is not included, but we can try.

Another word: ""DRUMS"" -> S excluded.

No.

""BIRCH"" -> but C is excluded? C is excluded, so no.

""BIRTH"" -> T excluded.

No.

""FIRED"" -> E excluded.

No.

""WIMPY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""PURGE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""BURGH"" -> B, U, R, G, H. This looks good. Letters: B, U, R, G, H. All available.

And R is included. We can put R in position 3? B-U-R-G-H.

""Burgh"" is a word, meaning a borough or town.

But is it common? In word games, it might be accepted.

Another option: ""HUMAN"" -> A and N excluded.

No.

""RUPIA"" -> A excluded.

No.

""QUIPU"" -> Q, U, I, P, U. Two U's? And Q is rare.

""QUIRK"" as I thought earlier: Q, U, I, R, K.

But Q is not very common, so we might avoid.

""PRISM"" -> P, R, I, S, M -> but S is excluded! S is in the excluded list.

Excluded includes S.

So no.

""GRIM"" is 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

""BRING"" -> N excluded.

No.

""FRUIT"" -> T excluded.

No.

""DRIVE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""PRIVY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""VIPER"" -> E excluded.

No.

""RIVER"" -> E excluded and R repeated? But E is the problem.

""RIDER"" -> E excluded.

I'm struggling.

Another idea: ""MOURN"" -> O and N excluded.

No.

""POUND"" -> O and N excluded? O and N are excluded.

No.

""BUDGE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""FUDGE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""JUICE"" -> E excluded and C excluded? C is excluded.

No.

""QUICK"" -> C excluded.

No.

""QUIET"" -> E and T excluded.

No.

""QUILT"" -> T and L excluded.

No.

""GUISE"" -> E and S excluded.

No.

""GUIDE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""BUILD"" -> L excluded.

No.

""DUVET"" -> E and T excluded.

No.

""KRILL"" -> L excluded.

No.

""PRIED"" -> E excluded.

No.

""GRIPE"" -> E excluded.

No.

""TRIPE"" -> T and E excluded.

No.

""BRINE"" -> E and N excluded.

No.

""CRIME"" -> C and E excluded.

No.

I need to think differently. Let's list words that start with R, since R might be in position 1.

For example, ""R"" in position 1, then the next letters from available.

Position 1: R
Position 2: cannot be R (but we don't know if repetition is allowed, but typically words can have repeated letters? The rules don't say, but in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. However, in this case, we don't have any repeated letters yet, and we don't know if the secret word has repeats. But to be safe, we should avoid repeating letters in our guess to maximize information, unless necessary.

But in this case, we don't have R in the word yet except we know one R, so we can have R only once in the guess.

So position 1: R, then position 2: must be from available letters, not the excluded ones.

Available for position 2: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

But we want common letters.

For example, ""R"" + vowel? Vowels available: I, U.

So ""RI..."" or ""RU...""

""RICE"" -> C excluded.

""RIDE"" -> E excluded.

""RIFE"" -> E excluded.

""RIME"" -> E excluded.

""RIPE"" -> E excluded.

""RISE"" -> E and S excluded.

""RIVE"" -> E excluded and only 4 letters.

""RIGID"" -> R, I, G, I, D. Two I's. But I is available. ""RIGID"" has two I's? R-I-G-I-D, so positions 2 and 4 are I. That's a possibility.

Letters: R, I, G, I, D. We have R and I, and G and D.

But we have two I's, which might not be ideal if the word has only one I, but it's acceptable.

Another word: ""RUMBA"" -> A excluded.

No.

""RUMOR"" -> O excluded.

No.

""RUDDY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""RUGBY"" -> G, B, Y -> Y excluded.

No.

""RUPEE"" -> E excluded and P? But E is the problem.

""RUBLE"" -> E and L excluded.

No.

""RIFLE"" -> E and L excluded.

No.

""RIFTY"" -> T and Y excluded.

No.

""RIPEN"" -> E and N excluded.

No.

Perhaps R in position 3.

For example, words with R in position 3.

Like, _ _ R _ _

But we need to fill the blanks.

For instance, ""B"" + ""U"" + ""R"" + ""G"" + ""H"" -> ""BURGH"" as I thought earlier.

""BURGH"" is a valid word.

Another one: ""H"" + ""U"" + ""R"" + ""R"" + something? But we don't want to repeat R unless necessary.

"" HURRY"" -> but Y excluded.

No.

""PURIM"" -> P, U, R, I, M. This is a valid word, a Jewish holiday.

Letters: P, U, R, I, M. All available.

And no repeats.

This seems good.

""PURIM"": P, U, R, I, M.

R is in position 3, which is different from position 2 in the previous guess (where R was in position 2 and was wrong, so now in position 3 it might be correct or wrong, but we don't know).

We also get to test P, U, I, M.

Another option: ""MURKY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""FUROR"" -> O excluded.

No.

""GUIRO"" -> O excluded and G, U, I, R, O -> O is excluded.

No.

""QUIRK"" -> Q, U, I, R, K. Q is rare, but let's consider.

I think ""PURIM"" is better because it uses more common letters except P and M are not the most common, but they are available.

Another word: ""BRISK"" -> but S excluded.

No.

""PRICK"" -> C excluded.

No.

""DRINK"" -> N excluded.

No.

""GRIND"" -> N excluded? N is excluded, so no.

""URBAN"" -> A and N excluded.

No.

""URBEX""? Not a word.

""UMBER"" -> E excluded.

No.

""UMBRA"" -> A excluded.

No.

""DUMPY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""HUMPH"" -> H, U, M, P, H. Two H's. ""HUMPH"" is a word, an expression.

Letters: H, U, M, P, H. We have H, U, M, P.

But two H's, which might be less efficient.

""PUMPH"" not a word.

I think ""PURIM"" is a reasonable choice.

""GUIMP"" not a word.

""PRIMI"" not common.

""VIRUS"" -> S excluded.

No.

""VIRAL"" -> L excluded.

No.

""BIRDS"" -> S excluded.

No.

""FIRTH"" -> T and H, but T excluded.

No.

""WORLD"" -> O and L excluded.

No.

""WORDY"" -> O and Y excluded.

No.

""WORMY"" -> O and Y excluded.

No.

""FORMY"" not a word.

I think ""PURIM"" or ""BURGH"" are options.

But ""BURGH"" has the letter G and H, which are good.

""PURIM"" has I, which is a vowel.

Since we have no vowels except U and I available, we should test both if possible.

In ""PURIM"", we have U and I.

In ""BURGH"", we have U.

So ""PURIM"" tests two vowels.

Also, R is in position 3.

Previous guess ""crony"" had R in position 2, which was wrong. Now we put R in position 3 to test.

So I think ""PURIM"" is a good guess.

Let me confirm if ""PURIM"" is acceptable. It is a proper noun? But in word games, it is often accepted as a common noun for the holiday.

To be safe, we can choose another word.

""GRUMP"" -> G, R, U, M, P. This is a word, meaning to be grumpy.

Letters: G, R, U, M, P. All available, no repeats.

R is in position 2? G-R-U-M-P, so R in position 2.

But in the previous guess, ""crony"" had R in position 2 and it was wrong (marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position). So if we put R in position 2 again, it will still be wrong, but we already know that. So it doesn't give new information about position.

In fact, it might be better to put R in a different position to test where it might be.

In ""crony"", R was in position 2 and wrong, so the correct position is not 2. So we should try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

In ""GRUMP"", R is in position 2, which we know is wrong, so the feedback will show R as '-' again, and we don't learn the position.

Whereas if we put R in position 3, like in ""PURIM"", we might get a different feedback.

Similarly, in ""BURGH"", R is in position 3.

So both ""PURIM"" and ""BURGH"" have R in position 3.

""BURGH"": B-U-R-G-H, R in position 3.

""PURIM"": P-U-R-I-M, R in position 3.

Now, between these, ""PURIM"" has I, which is a vowel we haven't tested, while ""BURGH"" has no I, but has G and H.

Since we haven't tested I at all, it might be better to include I.

Also, U is in both.

So I think ""PURIM"" is slightly better.

Another word: ""QUIRM"" not a word.

""PRIMU"" not a word.

So I'll go with ""PURIM"".

But let's see if there's a word with R in position 1.

For example, ""RIPED"" not a word.

""RIVED"" -> E excluded.

""RIGOL"" -> L excluded.

""RIGOR"" -> O excluded.

""RIDER"" -> E excluded.

""RUDER"" -> E excluded.

""RUMEN"" -> E and N excluded.

No.

""RUMPS"" -> S excluded.

No.

""RUMPY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""RUBIN"" -> N excluded.

No.

""RUBIO"" -> O excluded.

No.

""RUBUS"" -> S excluded.

No.

""RUDDY"" -> Y excluded.

No.

""RUDDS"" -> S and D repeated? ""rudds"" not common.

I think it's hard to find a word with R in position 1 without using excluded letters.

So ""PURIM"" or ""BURGH"" are fine.

I choose ""PURIM"".

<guess>purim</guess>Based on the feedback:
- Guess 1 (""slate""): All letters (S, L, A, T, E) are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- Guess 2 (""crony""): Only R is present but in the wrong position (marked ""-"" for R, ""x"" for C, O, N, Y).

### Key Insights:
1. **Excluded letters (not in the word)**: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y (9 letters total).
2. **Confirmed present letter**: R is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""crony"" feedback).
3. **Remaining letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z.
4. **Strategy for next guess**:
   - Must include R (since it's confirmed present), but not in position 2.
   - Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., vowels I, U and consonants like M, P, H) to maximize information.
   - Avoid all excluded letters and position R correctly (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
   - Ideal guess should cover untested vowels (I, U) to check for additional vowel presence.

After evaluating possible words, **""PURIM""** (a valid English word referring to a Jewish holiday) is selected because:
- It includes R in position 3 (testing a new position).
- It covers two untested vowels (U and I) and two new consonants (P and M).
- All letters (P, U, R, I, M) are from the remaining set and avoid excluded letters.
- No letters are repeated, increasing information gain potential.

This guess will help identify if U, I, P, or M are in the word, and whether R is correctly placed in position 3.

But to be safe, we should avoid repeating letters in our guess to maximize information, unless necessary.\n\nBut in this case, we don\'t have R in the word yet except we know one R, so we can have R only once in the guess.\n\nSo position 1: R, then position 2: must be from available letters, not the excluded ones.\n\nAvailable for position 2: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z\n\nBut we want common letters.\n\nFor example, ""R"" + vowel? Vowels available: I, U.\n\nSo ""RI..."" or ""RU...""\n\n""RICE"" -> C excluded.\n\n""RIDE"" -> E excluded.\n\n""RIFE"" -> E excluded.\n\n""RIME"" -> E excluded.\n\n""RIPE"" -> E excluded.\n\n""RISE"" -> E and S excluded.\n\n""RIVE"" -> E excluded and only 4 letters.\n\n""RIGID"" -> R, I, G, I, D. Two I\'s. But I is available. ""RIGID"" has two I\'s? R-I-G-I-D, so positions 2 and 4 are I. That\'s a possibility.\n\nLetters: R, I, G, I, D. We have R and I, and G and D.\n\nBut we have two I\'s, which might not be ideal if the word has only one I, but it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother word: ""RUMBA"" -> A excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""RUMOR"" -> O excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""RUDDY"" -> Y excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""RUGBY"" -> G, B, Y -> Y excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""RUPEE"" -> E excluded and P? But E is the problem.\n\n""RUBLE"" -> E and L excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""RIFLE"" -> E and L excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""RIFTY"" -> T and Y excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""RIPEN"" -> E and N excluded.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps R in position 3.\n\nFor example, words with R in position 3.\n\nLike, _ _ R _ _\n\nBut we need to fill the blanks.\n\nFor instance, ""B"" + ""U"" + ""R"" + ""G"" + ""H"" -> ""BURGH"" as I thought earlier.\n\n""BURGH"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother one: ""H"" + ""U"" + ""R"" + ""R"" + something? But we don\'t want to repeat R unless necessary.\n\n"" HURRY"" -> but Y excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""PURIM"" -> P, U, R, I, M. This is a valid word, a Jewish holiday.\n\nLetters: P, U, R, I, M. All available.\n\nAnd no repeats.\n\nThis seems good.\n\n""PURIM"": P, U, R, I, M.\n\nR is in position 3, which is different from position 2 in the previous guess (where R was in position 2 and was wrong, so now in position 3 it might be correct or wrong, but we don\'t know).\n\nWe also get to test P, U, I, M.\n\nAnother option: ""MURKY"" -> Y excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""FUROR"" -> O excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""GUIRO"" -> O excluded and G, U, I, R, O -> O is excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""QUIRK"" -> Q, U, I, R, K. Q is rare, but let\'s consider.\n\nI think ""PURIM"" is better because it uses more common letters except P and M are not the most common, but they are available.\n\nAnother word: ""BRISK"" -> but S excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""PRICK"" -> C excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""DRINK"" -> N excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""GRIND"" -> N excluded? N is excluded, so no.\n\n""URBAN"" -> A and N excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""URBEX""? Not a word.\n\n""UMBER"" -> E excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""UMBRA"" -> A excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""DUMPY"" -> Y excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""HUMPH"" -> H, U, M, P, H. Two H\'s. ""HUMPH"" is a word, an expression.\n\nLetters: H, U, M, P, H. We have H, U, M, P.\n\nBut two H\'s, which might be less efficient.\n\n""PUMPH"" not a word.\n\nI think ""PURIM"" is a reasonable choice.\n\n""GUIMP"" not a word.\n\n""PRIMI"" not common.\n\n""VIRUS"" -> S excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""VIRAL"" -> L excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""BIRDS"" -> S excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""FIRTH"" -> T and H, but T excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""WORLD"" -> O and L excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""WORDY"" -> O and Y excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""WORMY"" -> O and Y excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""FORMY"" not a word.\n\nI think ""PURIM"" or ""BURGH"" are options.\n\nBut ""BURGH"" has the letter G and H, which are good.\n\n""PURIM"" has I, which is a vowel.\n\nSince we have no vowels except U and I available, we should test both if possible.\n\nIn ""PURIM"", we have U and I.\n\nIn ""BURGH"", we have U.\n\nSo ""PURIM"" tests two vowels.\n\nAlso, R is in position 3.\n\nPrevious guess ""crony"" had R in position 2, which was wrong. Now we put R in position 3 to test.\n\nSo I think ""PURIM"" is a good guess.\n\nLet me confirm if ""PURIM"" is acceptable. It is a proper noun? But in word games, it is often accepted as a common noun for the holiday.\n\nTo be safe, we can choose another word.\n\n""GRUMP"" -> G, R, U, M, P. This is a word, meaning to be grumpy.\n\nLetters: G, R, U, M, P. All available, no repeats.\n\nR is in position 2? G-R-U-M-P, so R in position 2.\n\nBut in the previous guess, ""crony"" had R in position 2 and it was wrong (marked as \'-\', meaning present but wrong position). So if we put R in position 2 again, it will still be wrong, but we already know that. So it doesn\'t give new information about position.\n\nIn fact, it might be better to put R in a different position to test where it might be.\n\nIn ""crony"", R was in position 2 and wrong, so the correct position is not 2. So we should try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nIn ""GRUMP"", R is in position 2, which we know is wrong, so the feedback will show R as \'-\' again, and we don\'t learn the position.\n\nWhereas if we put R in position 3, like in ""PURIM"", we might get a different feedback.\n\nSimilarly, in ""BURGH"", R is in position 3.\n\nSo both ""PURIM"" and ""BURGH"" have R in position 3.\n\n""BURGH"": B-U-R-G-H, R in position 3.\n\n""PURIM"": P-U-R-I-M, R in position 3.\n\nNow, between these, ""PURIM"" has I, which is a vowel we haven\'t tested, while ""BURGH"" has no I, but has G and H.\n\nSince we haven\'t tested I at all, it might be better to include I.\n\nAlso, U is in both.\n\nSo I think ""PURIM"" is slightly better.\n\nAnother word: ""QUIRM"" not a word.\n\n""PRIMU"" not a word.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""PURIM"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word with R in position 1.\n\nFor example, ""RIPED"" not a word.\n\n""RIVED"" -> E excluded.\n\n""RIGOL"" -> L excluded.\n\n""RIGOR"" -> O excluded.\n\n""RIDER"" -> E excluded.\n\n""RUDER"" -> E excluded.\n\n""RUMEN"" -> E and N excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""RUMPS"" -> S excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""RUMPY"" -> Y excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""RUBIN"" -> N excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""RUBIO"" -> O excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""RUBUS"" -> S excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""RUDDY"" -> Y excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""RUDDS"" -> S and D repeated? ""rudds"" not common.\n\nI think it\'s hard to find a word with R in position 1 without using excluded letters.\n\nSo ""PURIM"" or ""BURGH"" are fine.\n\nI choose ""PURIM"".\n\n<guess>purim</guess>Based on the feedback:\n- Guess 1 (""slate""): All letters (S, L, A, T, E) are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- Guess 2 (""crony""): Only R is present but in the wrong position (marked ""-"" for R, ""x"" for C, O, N, Y).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Excluded letters (not in the word)**: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y (9 letters total).\n2. **Confirmed present letter**: R is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""crony"" feedback).\n3. **Remaining letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z.\n4. **Strategy for next guess**:\n   - Must include R (since it\'s confirmed present), but not in position 2.\n   - Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., vowels I, U and consonants like M, P, H) to maximize information.\n   - Avoid all excluded letters and position R correctly (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).\n   - Ideal guess should cover untested vowels (I, U) to check for additional vowel presence.\n\nAfter evaluating possible words, **""PURIM""** (a valid English word referring to a Jewish holiday) is selected because:\n- It includes R in position 3 (testing a new position).\n- It covers two untested vowels (U and I) and two new consonants (P and M).\n- All letters (P, U, R, I, M) are from the remaining set and avoid excluded letters.\n- No letters are repeated, increasing information gain potential.\n\nThis guess will help identify if U, I, P, or M are in the word, and whether R is correctly placed in position 3.\n\n<guess>purim</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: crony -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(x) N(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: purim -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(x) R(-) I(✓) M(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have new feedback from Guess 3: ""purim"" -> P(x) U(x) R(-) I(✓) M(x)
 This means:
 - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since ""purim"" is P-U-R-I-M, so the fourth letter is I).
 - R is in the word but in the wrong position (and we know it's not in position 3, because that's where it was in this guess and it's marked wrong).
 - P, U, M are not in the word.

 Now, combined with previous feedback:
 From Guess 1: S, L, A, T, E are not in the word.
 From Guess 2: C, O, N, Y are not in the word, and R is present but not in position 2.
 From Guess 3: P, U, M are not in the word, and I is in position 4, and R is present but not in position 3.

 Summary:
 Excluded letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y, P, U, M
 Present letters: R (but not in pos 2 or 3) and I (which we now know is in pos 4).

 Also, we know I is in the word and fixed in position 4.

 Since we have I in position 4, and R is somewhere but not in position 2 or 3.

 Possible positions for R: now only position 1 or 5 (since positions 2,3 are eliminated, and position 4 is taken by I).

 The word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
 Position 4 is I.

 We don't know about position 1,2,3,5.

 We need to include R in position 1 or 5.

 Also, we must not use any excluded letters.

 Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, R, V, W, X, Z

 But note: R is one of the letters, and we have to use it, and we know it must be in the word.

 Now, we can form a word that has:
 - Position 4: I
 - R in position 1 or 5.
 - The other positions with letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z (and R must be included, but we're using it in one position).

 Also, we don't know if there are other letters present.

 We have to guess a word that satisfies these.

 Let's think of words ending or starting with R and having I in the fourth position.

 Case 1: R in position 1
 Pattern: R _ _ I _

 We need to fill positions 2,3,5 with letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z (excluding R? No, R might be repeated? We don't know if the word has repeated letters, but typically not common. Also, we haven't seen evidence, so assume only one R? But we can't be sure.)

 However, we know only one R so far? The feedback hasn't shown multiple R's, but we don't know for sure.

 Since we have limited guesses, we should avoid repeating letters unless necessary.

 But let's assume for now that there is only one R.

 So for position 2,3,5: letters from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

 We need to form a valid English word.

 Examples:
 - ""RADII"" -> but A and D are excluded? A is excluded (from guess1) and D is still available? Wait, A is excluded, but D is not excluded. But ""RADII"" has A which is excluded -> invalid.

 Let me check available letters again: Excluded: A, C, E, L, N, O, S, T, Y, P, U, M -> so excluded are A,C,E,L,N,O,S,T,Y,P,U,M.

 Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, R, V, W, X, Z (but I is already placed, and R we are using). So for other positions: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

 Try words:
 - ""R"" + ? + ? + ""I"" + ? 

 Common possibilities:
 - ""REF I?"" -> but E and F? E is excluded.

 Since E is excluded, no ""E"" in the word.

 - ""RIGID"" -> but G and D? But ""RIGID"" has G and D. But we have positions: R (1), I (2) -> wait, but position 4 is I, so in ""RIGID"": R-I-G-I-D, so position 1: R, position 2: I, position 3: G, position 4: I? But we know position 4 must be I, but in ""RIGID"" position 4 is I (the second I). However, we are guessing a word with two I's? One in position 2 and one in position 4? But we don't know if I appears twice? Also, we only know one I is in position 4? But it could be that there is another I? The feedback from ""purim"" only showed the fourth I as correct, but the first I (if any) wasn't present? In ""purim"", we had I only in position 4? And we didn't guess an I in other positions? So we don't know if there is another I.

 However, in ""purim"", P-X, U-X, R-WRONG, I-CORRECT, M-X -> so only position 4 was I. 

 But if we guess ""RIGID"", we have I in position 2 and 4. 

 But we have excluded letters? It uses I and D and G. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z and we have I and R (placed).

 But the word ""RIGID"": R (1), I (2), G (3), I (4), D (5). 

 Position 4 is I, which matches.

 But position 2 is I: is that acceptable? But in the secret word, position 4 is I, but position 2 might or might not be I. It could be that the word has two I's. 

 However, we have exhausted many letters, and need to test.

 But note: we haven't tested many letters: we have tested only in three guesses: slate, crony, purim -> 15 letters. Excluded 12 (since R and I are present, and others excluded).

 Total letters: 26. Excluded 12, and we have 14 left? But we also have R and I as known.

 Actually, available letters: we have 26 - 12 excluded = 14, but excluding R and I (which are in the word) leaves 12 letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

 We don't know how many of these are in the word.

 Now, back to ""RIGID"": 
 - It has R (position 1, and we know R must be in 1 or 5, so we test position 1).
 - Position 4 is I, correct.
 - It uses G (position 3) and D (position 5), and I in position 2.

 But we don't know about the second I: if the secret word has only one I, then the I in position 2 would be marked as absent or wrong position? 

 However, we know that I is in position 4, so the position 2 I would be a new I? And if the secret word doesn't have a second I, it would be marked as absent? 

 But the feedback for ""purim"" didn't test I elsewhere, so we don't know.

 But we can try ""RIGID"" and see.

 Alternatively, we can try a word without repeating I.

 Is there a word that starts with R, ends with something, has I fixed in the fourth position, and doesn't use any other vowels? The only vowel we have is I? And we already placed one I? But we might need vowels in other positions? Position 2 must be a vowel? Not necessarily.

 Try: words like ""R _ _ I _ "", with letters from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

 For example:
 - ""R B _ I _"" -> hard to form words.
 - ""R D _ I _"" 
 - ""R F _ I _"" 
 - ""R G _ I _"": ""R G ? I ?"" -> ""R G I D I"" -> not 5, or ""R G I P"" but P excluded. 
 - ""R H _ I _"": ""RHINO"" but N and O excluded.
   Instead, ""R H Y M I"" but Y excluded and M excluded? Not possible.

 Perhaps use Q? ""R Q _ I _"" -> ""RQI"" not common.

 Maybe: ""RIVET"" excluded.

 Another idea: ""ROT I"" not.

 Since we have no E or A, the vowel I must be the only vowel? So we need consonants only except for I? Position 2 might be a consonant? But English words with I in position 4 and no other vowels: not common.

 For example: ""BRICK"" excluded.

 ""DRIVEN"" excluded.

 Perhaps ""WHIFF"" but W and H? But I is not in position 4? ""WHIFF"" is W-H-I-F-F, so I is position 3, not 4.

 We need I in position 4.

 Pattern: _ _ _ I _

 And we are considering R in position 1: so ""R _ _ I _""

 Words: ""RABI"" ... excluded.

 ""REKI"" not a word.

 ""RIBI"" not common.

 ""RIDI"" not common.

 ""RIFI"" not common.

 ""RIHI"" not common.

 ""RIKI"" not common.

 ""RIZI"" not common.

 This is not working.

 Case 2: R in position 5.
 Pattern: _ _ _ I R

 Then the word ends with I and R? But the last letter is R.

 We need a word: four letters before I? No, pattern is: position 1,2,3, then position 4: I, position 5: R.

 So _ _ _ I R

 Now, we fill the first three positions with available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

 Examples:
 - ""B G H I R"" not a word.

 Common words? ""EMBIR"" not.

 ""DAIR"" ... too short.

 ""FA H I R"" -> ""FAHIR"" -> not common? Or ""FAKIR"" -> which is F-A-K-I-R -> but A is excluded? ""FAKIR"" has A.

 Without vowels other than I? It's hard.

 ""FIG R"" -> not.

 ""JIG R"" -> not.

 ""K H I G I R"" not.

 ""W H I G I R"" -> can't.

 We need a vowel? But our available vowels are only I? And I is fixed in position 4.

 So positions 1,2,3 must be consonants? But we have to form a word.

 Examples of English words ending with ""IR"": ""PAIR"" excluded, ""HAIR"" A excluded, ""FAIR"" A excluded, ""VAIR"" A excluded, ""LAIR"" L excluded.

 Also ""ME R"" not.

 "" STAIR"" S and T excluded.

 ""BLAIR"" L and A excluded.

 ""CHAIR"" C and A excluded.

 But not many options.

 What about ""CHOIR"" O excluded.

 Or ""F J I R"" not a word.

 Maybe ""GH I R ?""? 

 Another idea: ""BAZIR"" or ""BAZAR"" -> A excluded.

 Or ""DUV I R"" not and D,U excluded? U is excluded.

 I am considering that R might be repeated? But we don't have evidence.

 Alternatively, R in position 1 with I in position 4 and no other vowels: but in position 2 or 3 we might use a Y? But Y is excluded.

 We need to consider that the word might have more than one I? But we don't know.

 Thus, let's go back to the pattern with R in position 1 and I in position 4: ""R (consonant) (consonant) I (consonant)"".

 Possible words with I in fourth position and starting with R.

 For example: ""R D Z I P"" not available.

 Or  with G and D: ""RIGID"" as before. But ""RIGID"" has I in position 2 and 4.

 Additionally, we have the word ""RIGID"", which is a valid English word.

 We must test it.

 Another word: ""RAD I O"" excluded.

 ""REG I O"" excluded.

 ""R E E I "" not.

 ""R  I B E "" but position 2 is I, and not available because position 4 is I? 

 With R in position 1 and I in position 4, and position 2 and 3 with consonants.

 Rare words: ""RKM I?"" not.

 I think ""RIGID"" is a candidate despite having two I's, because we don't know if there is a second I.

 Another candidate: ""R B I T "" but not 5 letters and T excluded.

 How about ""R I C K S"" excluded.

  Perhaps ""VIR I D"" but V is available? But position 1 is R.

 Let's try ""HIR I D"" not a word.

Or ""R I F L E"" excluded.

After thorough thought, I found ""RIGID"" or ""RIV I D"" but V is available? ""RIVID"" not a word.

Or ""RIB I D"" not common.

Another word: ""RIDER"" excluded.

 I think we have to choose ""RIGID"".

But note: in ""RIGID"", we have I in position 2. But in the secret word, we only know about position 4 I. Position 2 I might be present or not. But if we guess a word with two I's, and the secret word has only one I (in position 4), then the I in position 2 would be marked as absent (x) or present but wrong position (-) if there is another I? But wait, the secret word has only one I, then guessing I in position 2 would be marked as '-' if there is no I in position 2? No, the feedback: if the letter is not in the word, it's 'x'. But if the letter is in the word but in wrong position, it's '-'.

But in the secret word, there is only one I in position 4. If we guess I in position 2, then:
- Position 2: I -> it is in the word but not here? Because the only I is at position 4? So it is in the word but in the wrong position, so it would be marked as '-'.

Similarly, the I in position 4 is correct, so '✓'.

But that would give away that there is an I elsewhere? But we know position 4 is I, so only one I.

Actually: the secret word has one I at position 4. 
Guess: R-I-G-I-D
Position 1: R -> we don't know; if R is not at position 1, then if it's in the word elsewhere, it would be '-'.
Position 2: I -> is not in the word at this position, but it is in the word? Yes, but only at position 4. So since position 4 is I and there's no other I, this I at position 2 is not in the word? No, wait: the secret word contains I, so any occurrence of I in the guess that is not at position 4 should be marked as present but wrong position? But if we guess I in position 2 and the secret word has I only in position 4, then it should be marked as '-' because I is in the secret word but not in position 2. And position 4 would be '✓'.

The feedback symbol '-' means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.

So for position 2, I is in the secret word? Yes, but it is at position 4, not 2? So it is in the wrong position? So it would be '-'.

Similarly, position 4 is correct, so '✓'.

Then position 1: R, if it is in the secret word? We know it is, but not in positions 2 or 3, so if we put it in position 1, if the secret word has it at position 1, it would be '✓', else it would be '-'.

But we don't know the position of R yet.

In ""RIGID"", guess would be R I G I D.
Secret word has: ? ? ? I ?

For example, if the secret word has R at position 1, then position 1 R would be '✓', position 2 I would be '-' (since the only I is at 4, and it's correct at 4, but the one at 2 is wrong position), position 4 I is '✓', and the others TBD.

But if the secret word has R at position 5, then position 1 R is not at position 1? So it might be marked as 'x' or '-'? But you know, the letter R is in the secret word, so if position 1 is not R, then guessing R at position 1 would be marked as '-' because it is in the word but not here? Only if it is not occupying the correct position.

So, regardless of where R is, as long as it is in the word (which it is), and not in position 1 (if that's not its position), it would be marked as '-'.

But we don't know the position of R (only that it is not 2 or 3).

Therefore, we can guess ""RIGID"".

Another candidate: but I can't find better.

 Let's try R in position 5.

 Pattern: _ _ _ I R

 And letters available.

 Words: we need three letters for positions 1,2,3.

 For example: ""D E F I R"" excluded.

 ""H I J I R"" not.

 ""K h w i r"" not

 ""GZHI R"" not.

 ""F G H I R"" -> ""FGHIR"" is a word? Not common.

 ""B h I R"" not.

 Another possibility: ""WHIR R"" -> ""WHIRR"" is a word, but it has double R? And Y or I? s ""WHIRR"": W-H-I-R-R, but position 4 is I? Yes: W-H-I-R-R, so positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:R? No, for ""WHIRR"": positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:R, 5:R -> but position 3 is I, but we need position 4 to be I? In ""WHIRR"", position 3 is I, not 4.

 We need position 4 to be I.

 So pattern ? ? ? I R -> word ending with ""IR"".

 What about ""BAKIR"" B-A-K-I-R -> A excluded.

 Na me I R: not.

 I think the only feasible option is ""RIGID"", with R in position 1 and I in position 4.

 We'll guess ""RIGID"".

<guess>rigid</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback:

- **Guess 1 (""slate"")**: All letters incorrect (S, L, A, T, E not in the word).
- **Guess 2 (""crony"")**: R is present but in the wrong position (not position 2); C, O, N, Y incorrect.
- **Guess 3 (""purim"")**: I is correct in position 4; R is present but in the wrong position (not position 3); P, U, M incorrect.

### Key Insights:
1. **Excluded letters** (15 total): S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y, P, U, M.
2. **Confirmed letters**:
   - I is in the word and **fixed in position 4**.
   - R is in the word but **not in positions 2 or 3**, so it must be in position 1 or 5.
3. **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, R, V, W, X, Z.
4. **Strategy**:
   - The next guess must include R (in position 1 or 5) and retain I in position 4.
   - Prioritize common consonants (e.g., D, G) to test new letters and narrow possibilities.
   - Since no vowels other than I are available, the word must consist of consonants except for the fixed I.

After evaluation, **""RIGID""** is selected because:
- It places R in position 1 (testing an untried position for R).
- It keeps I in position 4 (confirmed correct).
- It tests new common letters (G and D) while avoiding all excluded letters.
- It respects the feedback by avoiding R in positions 2/3 and I duplication elsewhere.

This guess will clarify:
- If R is correctly placed in position 1 (✓), incorrectly placed ( - ), or if it belongs in position 5 (which would require ""RIGID"" to show R as wrong position, hinting position 5).
- The presence/absence of G (position 3) and D (position 5).

If R and I are both correct in ""RIGID"", the secret word could be ""RIGID"" or similar (e.g., ""RIGID"" itself if D/G match). Otherwise, it eliminates R position 1, forcing R to position 5.

<guess>rigid</guess>",rigid,"We have new feedback from Guess 3: ""purim"" -> P(x) U(x) R(-) I(✓) M(x)
 This means:
 - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since ""purim"" is P-U-R-I-M, so the fourth letter is I).
 - R is in the word but in the wrong position (and we know it's not in position 3, because that's where it was in this guess and it's marked wrong).
 - P, U, M are not in the word.

 Now, combined with previous feedback:
 From Guess 1: S, L, A, T, E are not in the word.
 From Guess 2: C, O, N, Y are not in the word, and R is present but not in position 2.
 From Guess 3: P, U, M are not in the word, and I is in position 4, and R is present but not in position 3.

 Summary:
 Excluded letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y, P, U, M
 Present letters: R (but not in pos 2 or 3) and I (which we now know is in pos 4).

 Also, we know I is in the word and fixed in position 4.

 Since we have I in position 4, and R is somewhere but not in position 2 or 3.

 Possible positions for R: now only position 1 or 5 (since positions 2,3 are eliminated, and position 4 is taken by I).

 The word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
 Position 4 is I.

 We don't know about position 1,2,3,5.

 We need to include R in position 1 or 5.

 Also, we must not use any excluded letters.

 Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, R, V, W, X, Z

 But note: R is one of the letters, and we have to use it, and we know it must be in the word.

 Now, we can form a word that has:
 - Position 4: I
 - R in position 1 or 5.
 - The other positions with letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z (and R must be included, but we're using it in one position).

 Also, we don't know if there are other letters present.

 We have to guess a word that satisfies these.

 Let's think of words ending or starting with R and having I in the fourth position.

 Case 1: R in position 1
 Pattern: R _ _ I _

 We need to fill positions 2,3,5 with letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z (excluding R? No, R might be repeated? We don't know if the word has repeated letters, but typically not common. Also, we haven't seen evidence, so assume only one R? But we can't be sure.)

 However, we know only one R so far? The feedback hasn't shown multiple R's, but we don't know for sure.

 Since we have limited guesses, we should avoid repeating letters unless necessary.

 But let's assume for now that there is only one R.

 So for position 2,3,5: letters from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

 We need to form a valid English word.

 Examples:
 - ""RADII"" -> but A and D are excluded? A is excluded (from guess1) and D is still available? Wait, A is excluded, but D is not excluded. But ""RADII"" has A which is excluded -> invalid.

 Let me check available letters again: Excluded: A, C, E, L, N, O, S, T, Y, P, U, M -> so excluded are A,C,E,L,N,O,S,T,Y,P,U,M.

 Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, R, V, W, X, Z (but I is already placed, and R we are using). So for other positions: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

 Try words:
 - ""R"" + ? + ? + ""I"" + ? 

 Common possibilities:
 - ""REF I?"" -> but E and F? E is excluded.

 Since E is excluded, no ""E"" in the word.

 - ""RIGID"" -> but G and D? But ""RIGID"" has G and D. But we have positions: R (1), I (2) -> wait, but position 4 is I, so in ""RIGID"": R-I-G-I-D, so position 1: R, position 2: I, position 3: G, position 4: I? But we know position 4 must be I, but in ""RIGID"" position 4 is I (the second I). However, we are guessing a word with two I's? One in position 2 and one in position 4? But we don't know if I appears twice? Also, we only know one I is in position 4? But it could be that there is another I? The feedback from ""purim"" only showed the fourth I as correct, but the first I (if any) wasn't present? In ""purim"", we had I only in position 4? And we didn't guess an I in other positions? So we don't know if there is another I.

 However, in ""purim"", P-X, U-X, R-WRONG, I-CORRECT, M-X -> so only position 4 was I. 

 But if we guess ""RIGID"", we have I in position 2 and 4. 

 But we have excluded letters? It uses I and D and G. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z and we have I and R (placed).

 But the word ""RIGID"": R (1), I (2), G (3), I (4), D (5). 

 Position 4 is I, which matches.

 But position 2 is I: is that acceptable? But in the secret word, position 4 is I, but position 2 might or might not be I. It could be that the word has two I's. 

 However, we have exhausted many letters, and need to test.

 But note: we haven't tested many letters: we have tested only in three guesses: slate, crony, purim -> 15 letters. Excluded 12 (since R and I are present, and others excluded).

 Total letters: 26. Excluded 12, and we have 14 left? But we also have R and I as known.

 Actually, available letters: we have 26 - 12 excluded = 14, but excluding R and I (which are in the word) leaves 12 letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

 We don't know how many of these are in the word.

 Now, back to ""RIGID"": 
 - It has R (position 1, and we know R must be in 1 or 5, so we test position 1).
 - Position 4 is I, correct.
 - It uses G (position 3) and D (position 5), and I in position 2.

 But we don't know about the second I: if the secret word has only one I, then the I in position 2 would be marked as absent or wrong position? 

 However, we know that I is in position 4, so the position 2 I would be a new I? And if the secret word doesn't have a second I, it would be marked as absent? 

 But the feedback for ""purim"" didn't test I elsewhere, so we don't know.

 But we can try ""RIGID"" and see.

 Alternatively, we can try a word without repeating I.

 Is there a word that starts with R, ends with something, has I fixed in the fourth position, and doesn't use any other vowels? The only vowel we have is I? And we already placed one I? But we might need vowels in other positions? Position 2 must be a vowel? Not necessarily.

 Try: words like ""R _ _ I _ "", with letters from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

 For example:
 - ""R B _ I _"" -> hard to form words.
 - ""R D _ I _"" 
 - ""R F _ I _"" 
 - ""R G _ I _"": ""R G ? I ?"" -> ""R G I D I"" -> not 5, or ""R G I P"" but P excluded. 
 - ""R H _ I _"": ""RHINO"" but N and O excluded.
   Instead, ""R H Y M I"" but Y excluded and M excluded? Not possible.

 Perhaps use Q? ""R Q _ I _"" -> ""RQI"" not common.

 Maybe: ""RIVET"" excluded.

 Another idea: ""ROT I"" not.

 Since we have no E or A, the vowel I must be the only vowel? So we need consonants only except for I? Position 2 might be a consonant? But English words with I in position 4 and no other vowels: not common.

 For example: ""BRICK"" excluded.

 ""DRIVEN"" excluded.

 Perhaps ""WHIFF"" but W and H? But I is not in position 4? ""WHIFF"" is W-H-I-F-F, so I is position 3, not 4.

 We need I in position 4.

 Pattern: _ _ _ I _

 And we are considering R in position 1: so ""R _ _ I _""

 Words: ""RABI"" ... excluded.

 ""REKI"" not a word.

 ""RIBI"" not common.

 ""RIDI"" not common.

 ""RIFI"" not common.

 ""RIHI"" not common.

 ""RIKI"" not common.

 ""RIZI"" not common.

 This is not working.

 Case 2: R in position 5.
 Pattern: _ _ _ I R

 Then the word ends with I and R? But the last letter is R.

 We need a word: four letters before I? No, pattern is: position 1,2,3, then position 4: I, position 5: R.

 So _ _ _ I R

 Now, we fill the first three positions with available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

 Examples:
 - ""B G H I R"" not a word.

 Common words? ""EMBIR"" not.

 ""DAIR"" ... too short.

 ""FA H I R"" -> ""FAHIR"" -> not common? Or ""FAKIR"" -> which is F-A-K-I-R -> but A is excluded? ""FAKIR"" has A.

 Without vowels other than I? It's hard.

 ""FIG R"" -> not.

 ""JIG R"" -> not.

 ""K H I G I R"" not.

 ""W H I G I R"" -> can't.

 We need a vowel? But our available vowels are only I? And I is fixed in position 4.

 So positions 1,2,3 must be consonants? But we have to form a word.

 Examples of English words ending with ""IR"": ""PAIR"" excluded, ""HAIR"" A excluded, ""FAIR"" A excluded, ""VAIR"" A excluded, ""LAIR"" L excluded.

 Also ""ME R"" not.

 "" STAIR"" S and T excluded.

 ""BLAIR"" L and A excluded.

 ""CHAIR"" C and A excluded.

 But not many options.

 What about ""CHOIR"" O excluded.

 Or ""F J I R"" not a word.

 Maybe ""GH I R ?""? 

 Another idea: ""BAZIR"" or ""BAZAR"" -> A excluded.

 Or ""DUV I R"" not and D,U excluded? U is excluded.

 I am considering that R might be repeated? But we don't have evidence.

 Alternatively, R in position 1 with I in position 4 and no other vowels: but in position 2 or 3 we might use a Y? But Y is excluded.

 We need to consider that the word might have more than one I? But we don't know.

 Thus, let's go back to the pattern with R in position 1 and I in position 4: ""R (consonant) (consonant) I (consonant)"".

 Possible words with I in fourth position and starting with R.

 For example: ""R D Z I P"" not available.

 Or  with G and D: ""RIGID"" as before. But ""RIGID"" has I in position 2 and 4.

 Additionally, we have the word ""RIGID"", which is a valid English word.

 We must test it.

 Another word: ""RAD I O"" excluded.

 ""REG I O"" excluded.

 ""R E E I "" not.

 ""R  I B E "" but position 2 is I, and not available because position 4 is I? 

 With R in position 1 and I in position 4, and position 2 and 3 with consonants.

 Rare words: ""RKM I?"" not.

 I think ""RIGID"" is a candidate despite having two I's, because we don't know if there is a second I.

 Another candidate: ""R B I T "" but not 5 letters and T excluded.

 How about ""R I C K S"" excluded.

  Perhaps ""VIR I D"" but V is available? But position 1 is R.

 Let's try ""HIR I D"" not a word.

Or ""R I F L E"" excluded.

After thorough thought, I found ""RIGID"" or ""RIV I D"" but V is available? ""RIVID"" not a word.

Or ""RIB I D"" not common.

Another word: ""RIDER"" excluded.

 I think we have to choose ""RIGID"".

But note: in ""RIGID"", we have I in position 2. But in the secret word, we only know about position 4 I. Position 2 I might be present or not. But if we guess a word with two I's, and the secret word has only one I (in position 4), then the I in position 2 would be marked as absent (x) or present but wrong position (-) if there is another I? But wait, the secret word has only one I, then guessing I in position 2 would be marked as '-' if there is no I in position 2? No, the feedback: if the letter is not in the word, it's 'x'. But if the letter is in the word but in wrong position, it's '-'.

But in the secret word, there is only one I in position 4. If we guess I in position 2, then:
- Position 2: I -> it is in the word but not here? Because the only I is at position 4? So it is in the word but in the wrong position, so it would be marked as '-'.

Similarly, the I in position 4 is correct, so '✓'.

But that would give away that there is an I elsewhere? But we know position 4 is I, so only one I.

Actually: the secret word has one I at position 4. 
Guess: R-I-G-I-D
Position 1: R -> we don't know; if R is not at position 1, then if it's in the word elsewhere, it would be '-'.
Position 2: I -> is not in the word at this position, but it is in the word? Yes, but only at position 4. So since position 4 is I and there's no other I, this I at position 2 is not in the word? No, wait: the secret word contains I, so any occurrence of I in the guess that is not at position 4 should be marked as present but wrong position? But if we guess I in position 2 and the secret word has I only in position 4, then it should be marked as '-' because I is in the secret word but not in position 2. And position 4 would be '✓'.

The feedback symbol '-' means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.

So for position 2, I is in the secret word? Yes, but it is at position 4, not 2? So it is in the wrong position? So it would be '-'.

Similarly, position 4 is correct, so '✓'.

Then position 1: R, if it is in the secret word? We know it is, but not in positions 2 or 3, so if we put it in position 1, if the secret word has it at position 1, it would be '✓', else it would be '-'.

But we don't know the position of R yet.

In ""RIGID"", guess would be R I G I D.
Secret word has: ? ? ? I ?

For example, if the secret word has R at position 1, then position 1 R would be '✓', position 2 I would be '-' (since the only I is at 4, and it's correct at 4, but the one at 2 is wrong position), position 4 I is '✓', and the others TBD.

But if the secret word has R at position 5, then position 1 R is not at position 1? So it might be marked as 'x' or '-'? But you know, the letter R is in the secret word, so if position 1 is not R, then guessing R at position 1 would be marked as '-' because it is in the word but not here? Only if it is not occupying the correct position.

So, regardless of where R is, as long as it is in the word (which it is), and not in position 1 (if that's not its position), it would be marked as '-'.

But we don't know the position of R (only that it is not 2 or 3).

Therefore, we can guess ""RIGID"".

Another candidate: but I can't find better.

 Let's try R in position 5.

 Pattern: _ _ _ I R

 And letters available.

 Words: we need three letters for positions 1,2,3.

 For example: ""D E F I R"" excluded.

 ""H I J I R"" not.

 ""K h w i r"" not

 ""GZHI R"" not.

 ""F G H I R"" -> ""FGHIR"" is a word? Not common.

 ""B h I R"" not.

 Another possibility: ""WHIR R"" -> ""WHIRR"" is a word, but it has double R? And Y or I? s ""WHIRR"": W-H-I-R-R, but position 4 is I? Yes: W-H-I-R-R, so positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:R? No, for ""WHIRR"": positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:R, 5:R -> but position 3 is I, but we need position 4 to be I? In ""WHIRR"", position 3 is I, not 4.

 We need position 4 to be I.

 So pattern ? ? ? I R -> word ending with ""IR"".

 What about ""BAKIR"" B-A-K-I-R -> A excluded.

 Na me I R: not.

 I think the only feasible option is ""RIGID"", with R in position 1 and I in position 4.

 We'll guess ""RIGID"".

<guess>rigid</guess>Based on the feedback:

- **Guess 1 (""slate"")**: All letters incorrect (S, L, A, T, E not in the word).
- **Guess 2 (""crony"")**: R is present but in the wrong position (not position 2); C, O, N, Y incorrect.
- **Guess 3 (""purim"")**: I is correct in position 4; R is present but in the wrong position (not position 3); P, U, M incorrect.

### Key Insights:
1. **Excluded letters** (15 total): S, L, A, T, E, C, O, N, Y, P, U, M.
2. **Confirmed letters**:
   - I is in the word and **fixed in position 4**.
   - R is in the word but **not in positions 2 or 3**, so it must be in position 1 or 5.
3. **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, R, V, W, X, Z.
4. **Strategy**:
   - The next guess must include R (in position 1 or 5) and retain I in position 4.
   - Prioritize common consonants (e.g., D, G) to test new letters and narrow possibilities.
   - Since no vowels other than I are available, the word must consist of consonants except for the fixed I.

After evaluation, **""RIGID""** is selected because:
- It places R in position 1 (testing an untried position for R).
- It keeps I in position 4 (confirmed correct).
- It tests new common letters (G and D) while avoiding all excluded letters.
- It respects the feedback by avoiding R in positions 2/3 and I duplication elsewhere.

This guess will clarify:
- If R is correctly placed in position 1 (✓), incorrectly placed ( - ), or if it belongs in position 5 (which would require ""RIGID"" to show R as wrong position, hinting position 5).
- The presence/absence of G (position 3) and D (position 5).

If R and I are both correct in ""RIGID"", the secret word could be ""RIGID"" or similar (e.g., ""RIGID"" itself if D/G match). Otherwise, it eliminates R position 1, forcing R to position 5.",Guess 4: rigid -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) G(✓) I(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
