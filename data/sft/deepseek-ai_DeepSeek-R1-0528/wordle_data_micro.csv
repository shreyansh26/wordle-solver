We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that:
- Contains common letters to maximize the chance of getting feedback (hits or misses).
- Covers a variety of letters to gather as much information as possible.

Common starting words in word games often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters and no repeating letters.

Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also a strong starter, but let me think of a word that includes more common vowels and consonants.

I think ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because:
- It has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (R, S, I) [note: I is sometimes a vowel but in this case, we can consider it as a consonant for commonality].
- Specifically, R, S, and E are very common.

Another option is ""SLATE"".

But since this is the first guess, any of these would be fine.

I'll go with ""RAISE"". Let's break it down:

R, A, I, S, E: These are all common letters.

After entering ""RAISE"", we will get feedback for each letter: whether it's correct (and in the right place), present but wrong place, or absent.

This feedback will then guide our next guess.

Since this is the first guess, I'll choose ""RAISE"".

Remember the format: the response should be the guessed word between <guess> and </guess> tags.

So, my first guess is: RAISE

We are making the first guess again because the previous attempt ""and"" was invalid (not five letters?).
 The user says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: and -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.""
 This indicates that the previous guess ""and"" was rejected because it wasn't five letters. So we must guess a valid five-letter word.

 Since we are starting over, we should pick a common starting word with five distinct letters to maximize information.

 Popular starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, CRATE, RAISE, etc.

 Let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has common letters and no repeats.

 Alternatively, note that the feedback said: ""Model answer is not five letters"" for ""and"", meaning our previous guess was invalid?

The previous guess ""and"" was invalid because it is not a five-letter word. Since it's the first valid guess, choosing a word with common letters and good coverage of vowels and consonants is strategic for gathering initial feedback. 

Optimal starting words often include:
- Multiple vowels (A, E, I, O) to test common patterns.
- High-frequency consonants (R, S, T, L, N).
- Distinct letters to maximize information per guess.

The word ""RAISE"" fits perfectly:
1. **Five distinct letters** (R, A, I, S, E).
2. Contains **three vowels** (A, I, E) and **two common consonants** (R, S).
3. Covers top-ranked letters used in English (E, A, R, S, I).

We are given feedback for Guess 2: RAISE -> R(-), A(x), I(-), S(x), E(x)
 This means:
   R is in the secret word but not in the first position (since it's marked with - for wrong position).
   A is not in the word at all.
   I is in the secret word but not in the third position.
   S is not in the word at all.
   E is not in the word at all.

 So, from this feedback, we know:
   The secret word contains R and I, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
   The secret word does not contain A, S, or E.

 We also know that R and I are present, so we must include them in the next guess, but in different positions.

 Now, for the next guess:
   We must choose a valid 5-letter English word that:
     - Does not contain A, S, E (since they are absent).
     - Contains R and I (since they are present).
     - The letter R should not be in position 1 (because in RAISE, R was in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but not in that position).
     - Similarly, the letter I should not be in position 3 (because in RAISE, I was in position 3 and got '-').

 Also, note that we don't know the positions of R and I yet.

 Considering constraints:
   The word must have R and I, and exclude A, S, E.

 Since the secret word has R but not in position 1, and I but not in position 3, we can try to place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 and I in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not position 3).

 We also want to test new letters to gain more information.

 Common letters that haven't been tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many new letters as possible to maximize information.

 Let's try to think of a word that:
   - Contains R and I (not in their forbidden positions).
   - Uses several other common consonants and vowels (but note: we know E is out, and A is out, so vowels available: O, U, and sometimes Y? But we haven't tested O and U).

 However, note that the secret word might have other vowels.

 Let's aim for a word with R and I and three new letters.

 Since R cannot be first, we can have the pattern:
   Option: R in second position? Or third? Or fourth? Or fifth?

 We also avoid putting I in third.

 Example words:

   If we put R in second position: 
      First letter can be a new letter, then R, then something (but not I in third, so third can be new, then I could be in fourth or fifth).
      Example: ""TROIK"" - not a word.

   Let's try putting R in fourth position and I in second?
      Example: word like ""_ _ I R _"", but then we have to fill the blanks.

   Available letters: We want common letters.

 We know that T, O, L, N are common. 

 Consider ""DRILL"": 
   Length: 5, but contains two L's. 
   R is in position 2 (allowed). I is in position 3? But we must avoid I in position 3? 
   Also, note: I is in position 3, which we must avoid? Because in RAISE, I was in position 3 and got '-', meaning the correct I is not at position 3. 
   So in the next guess, if we put I in position 3, it would be incorrect? Actually, we cannot use I in position 3 again? 
   But wait: the feedback doesn't prevent I from being in position 3, it only told us that the secret word's I is not in position 3. 
   However, could the secret word have two I's? 
   The feedback rules: 
      If a letter is in the word in the wrong position, there might be only one occurrence? Actually, the rules don't specify duplicates. 

 But note the example didn't have duplicates. We must consider duplicates:

   The game rules do not explicitly state how duplicates are handled, but common implementations (like Wordle) do the following:
      Each letter in the guess is matched with the secret word from left to right, and a duplicate letter may only get a '✓' or '-' if there is a matching duplicate in the secret word.

   However, our feedback doesn't specify if the secret word might have duplicates.

   Given the feedback for RAISE: 
        R is present but not in position 1 -> so secret word has at least one R.
        I is present but not in position 3 -> so secret word has at least one I.

   We don't know if they have more than one.

   But we must design our next guess without knowing duplicates.

   It's safer to assume that the secret word might have duplicates? However, we don't have evidence. Also, common words often don't have duplicates.

   So, we'll aim for a word that has R and I only once? That might be better to avoid confusion.

   Therefore, avoid putting R or I in positions that might conflict if we assume single instance.

   Since R cannot be in 1, and I cannot be in 3, we can try to put R in position 2 and I in position 1 (first and second).

   Pattern: I _ R _ _   -> Example: ""IRONY"" -> I at 1 (allowed, because secret's I could be at 1), R at 2 (allowed, because secret's R is not at 1 and we don't know about 2? We only know it's not at 1). But R was at 1 in our previous guess and got '-', meaning secret has R but that R is not at position 1. It could be at position 2? 

   However, we must be cautious: it's possible that the secret word has R at position 2? 

   Actually, the feedback says R is present but not at position 1. It doesn't say where it is.

   Similarly, I is present but not at 3.

   So ""IRONY"" would be:
        I in position 1: possible? But we haven't tested position 1 for I? 
        R in position 2: not forbidden.

   But note: we haven't tested the letter I at position 1? So that's new.

   Let's check if IRONY is a valid word: yes.

   Alternatively, we could put R in position 4 and I in position 2: 
        _ I _ R _ 

   Example: ""FIRED"" -> but E is absent? We cannot use E. So we must avoid E.

   Also, we cannot use S and A.

   So, let's look for words that:
        Contain R and I (exactly once? hoping for no duplicates for now)
        Do not contain A, S, E
        Put R not in position 1 and I not in position 3.

   Examples:
        IRONY: 
          I at 1 (okay), R at 2 (okay), O at 3 (not tested), N at 4 (not tested), Y at 5 (not tested).
          This word uses letters: I, R, O, N, Y.

        Proud: contains O and U -> ""PROUD"" but then I is not in it? So we must have both R and I.

        How about ""THIRD"": 
          T, H, I, R, D -> 
          R is at position 4: okay (not 1)
          I is at position 3: but wait, we must avoid putting I at position 3? Because in RAISE, I at 3 got '-' meaning it's present but not at 3? 
          So if we put I at 3 in this guess, we might get a '-' again? That doesn't tell us anything new? And we use a guess.

          Actually, we hope to avoid repeating known wrong positions? Because if we put I at 3 and get '-' then we already know it's not at 3? So that's redundant.

          Therefore, it's better to put I in a new position: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

        Similarly, R must not be at position 1? It can be at 2,3,4,5? But we also haven't tested R in other positions.

        So in ""THIRD"": 
          I is at 3 -> forbidden? Because feedback says I cannot be at 3? 
          Actually, the secret word doesn't have I at position 3? So if we put I at 3, we know for sure that it will be marked '-' (unless the secret has two I's and one is at 3? But we don't know that).

        Without knowing duplicates, to avoid ambiguity, we avoid putting I in position 3? Same for R in position 1.

        Hence, we should avoid position 3 for I and position 1 for R.

   So, back to examples:

      Option 1: IRONY (I in 1, R in 2) -> both positions are new for these letters? 
          But note: R was in position 1 last time? Now we put R in position 2: that's a new position.

      Option 2: a word with R in position 5 and I in position 2? Like ""GUILD"" but G,U,I,L,D -> but it has L... but we need R? Actually, ""GUILD"" doesn't contain R.

   Another example: ""ROBIN"" -> 
         R at position 1: forbidden? Because R was in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but not at 1? 
         So R at position 1 is bad? Then ROBIN is invalid.

   How about ""ORBIT"": 
         O _ _ _ _ -> wait, first letter O, then R? 
         Positions: O, R, B, I, T -> so R at 2, I at 4. 
         This satisfies: R not at 1 (it's at 2), I not at 3 (it's at 4). 
         Also, contains O, R, B, I, T -> letters not in {A, S, E}? Yes.

   ORBIT is a valid word? Yes.

   Another candidate: ""DIRTY"": 
         D, I, R, T, Y -> 
         D at 1, I at 2 (okay, because avoiding I at 3), R at 3 (okay? we didn't test R at 3? yes, because we only know about R at 1) -> allowed? 
         Yes: R was tested in position 1 and failed? So position 3 is new? 
         But note: R might be in position 3? 
         Also, we have I in position 2: which is a new position.

   But ORBIT and DIRTY and IRONY are all valid.

   Which one maximizes new information?

   IRONY: letters I, R (which are known), and O, N, Y (new).
   ORBIT: O, R, B, I, T -> letters: O, R, B, I, T -> known: R, I; new: O, B, T.
   DIRTY: D, I, R, T, Y -> known: R, I; new: D, T, Y.

   We haven't tested: O, B, T, D, Y, N.

   T is a very common letter? So including T might be good? 

   Also, note: the secret word doesn't have A, E, S -> so likely has T or O or other vowels? 

   Let's rank common letters: T, O, L, N, C, etc.

   IRONY: O and N are common? Also Y is less common.
   ORBIT: O and T are common? and B is less common? 
   DIRTY: T and D? and Y.

   ORBIT covers two common letters (O and T) and one less common (B). 

   But note: we only have 6 guesses, so we want to cover more common letters? 

   Alternatively, we can look for a word that includes T and O? Like ORTIC? not a word.

   Another word: ""POINT"" -> but does not contain R? We are forced to include R and I? Because they are known present? 

   Without R and I, we'd be ignoring known presence? So we must include both.

   Therefore, ORBIT (with O, R, B, I, T) seems to cover T and O? And B? 

   Alternatively, ""TROOP"" -> duplicate O and R? We avoid duplicates? and also R must not in position 1? TROOP has R at 1? -> invalid because R at 1 is disallowed for this guess? 

   Also, it doesn't have I? 

   How about ""TOUCH"" -> no R or I.

   Therefore, from the candidates:

      ORBIT: 
          Position 1: O (new)
          Position 2: R (we don't know about position 2 but R was only tested in 1? so this is new for R? So we might get ✓ or - for R? We hope for ✓)
          Position 3: B (new)
          Position 4: I (I was tested only in position 3? so testing I in 4? that's new? so we might get ✓ or - for I? We hope for ✓)
          Position 5: T (new)

      This seems good? 

      DIRTY: 
          Position 1: D (new)
          Position 2: I (new for I? because I was tested in 3? So testing I in 2? okay)
          Position 3: R (new for R? because R was tested in 1? So okay)
          Position 4: T (new)
          Position 5: Y (new)

      This also seems good? 

   ORBIT might be better because it includes the common letter T? But DIRTY has T too? and also D and Y? 

   Actually, both have T? 

   ORBIT: common letters O and T? DIRTY: common letters T and D? Let me check commonness:
      According to English letter frequency: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, ...

      But since A, E are absent, T and O are more common? 

   Also, ORBIT introduces three consonants and one vowel? secret word might have O.

   However, note feedback: RAISE had I which we know is present? but we don't know about vowels? because the secret word doesn't have E or A? so O or U might be present? 

   Since ORBIT includes O? if O is present? then also B and T? 

   We are looking for maximum information? 

   How about ""POINT"" -> doesn't have R? invalid? Because we must include R? 

   Another word: ""TRIPY""? not a word.

   Let me check ""RIGHT"": 
        R at 1 -> forbidden? But we can't put R at 1? not allowed? 
        So ""WRING"": 
           W at 1? then R at 2? I at 3? Forbidden: I cannot be at 3? 
        So we must avoid I at 3.

   So ""WRING"" is invalid? Because I at 3? 

   How about ""FRUIT"": 
        F, R, U, I, T -> 
        R at position 2? Okay? 
        I at position 4? Okay? 
        Contains U? Haven't tested U? 
        But has F and T? 
        Also, it uses U? 

        And it doesn't contain forbidden letters: A, S, E? 

        Yes: ""FRUIT"" is a word? Yes.

   Now compare FRUIT, ORBIT, DIRTY, IRONY.

   FRUIT: F, R, U, I, T -> new: F, U, T? known: R, I? 
   DIRTY: D, I, R, T, Y -> known: R, I; new: D, T, Y? 
   ORBIT: O, R, B, I, T -> known: R, I; new: O, B, T? 
   IRONY: I, R, O, N, Y -> known: R, I; new: O, N, Y? 

   Which one gives most information? 

   We want to test letters that are common? 

   Common consonants: T is very common? So T appears in FRUIT, ORBIT, and DIRTY? 
   FRUIT also tests U which is a vowel? and F which is common? 

   Actually, T is in the top 3? O in the top 5? 

   Therefore, ORBIT tests O (high) and T (high) and B (less common)? 
   FRUIT tests U (vowel? common) and T (high) and F (common)? 
   DIRTY tests D (common? above average), T and Y (less common)? 

   Let me see:

      FRUIT: F is the 6th most common consonant? T is 2nd? U is vowel? 
      But U is the 7th most common letter? 

      ORBIT: O is the 4th? T is 2nd? B is not that common? 

      So FRUIT might be better because it has U? which is a vowel? 

   However, we cannot say? 

   Another candidate: ""BUILT"" -> has U and I? but I? R is missing? 

   We must include R? 

   How about ""FLIRT"": 
        F, L, I, R, T -> 
        Positions: R at 4? I at 3? Wait? I at position 3? forbidden? 

   Because we cannot put I at position 3? so avoid? 

   How about ""TRYST""? Has duplicate T? and Y? but no I? 

   We must include I? 

   Final decision: 

   Given that we know the secret word has R and I? and excludes A, E, S? and we have no idea about duplicates? 

   We choose a word that uses R and I in new positions? and includes three new common letters? 

   ORBIT: 
        Position 1: O -> if O is present, might help? 
        Position 2: R -> because R was tested only in 1? we try position 2? might be correct? or wrong? 
        Position 4: I -> move? testing position 4? 
        Position 5: T -> common? 

   DIRTY: 
        Position 1: D -> might be common? 
        Position 2: I -> since I was at 3? we test position 2? 
        Position 3: R -> testing position 3 for R? 
        Position 4: T -> common? 

   Another one: ""OUTER"" -> contains E? forbidden? 

   How about ""QUIRK""? 
        Q, U, I, R, K -> 
        Positions: I at position 3? forbidden? 
        Not allowed? 

   Let me think of words that put I at 1, R at 5? 
        Example: ""INTRO"" -> 
             I at 1? R at 5? 
             But the word has N,T,R,O? and I? 
             I at 1: not tested before? 
             R at 5: new position? 
             But also has N, T, R, O? 
        The word ""INTRO"" is valid? 

        INTRO: I at position 1 (okay), N at 2, T at 3, R at 4 (wait? R at 4? because spelling: I-N-T-R-O? So positions:
          1: I
          2: N
          3: T
          4: R
          5: O

        I at 1: allowed? because we only know I is not at 3? 
        R at 4: allowed? because R not at 1? and 4 is new? 

        So ""INTRO"" is a candidate: I, N, T, R, O? 
        Letters: I, N, T, R, O? 
        Known: I and R? 
        New: N, T, O? 

   So INTRO: new common letters O, T? and N? 

   ORBIT, INTRO, IRONY are similar? 

   We need to choose one? 

   Let's pick ORBIT? Because it uses R at position 2 and I at position 4? which are two new positions? and INTRO has I at 1? which is also new? 

   ORBIT has T at the end? which might be important.

   Alternatively, we can pick ""POINT"" -> wait, no R? We must include R? 

   Final choice? ORBIT: because it uses two common letters O and T? and the word is common? 

   But another? How about ""BIRTH"":
        B, I, R, T, H -> 
        I at position 2: okay? 
        R at position 3: okay? 
        But note: the word has BIRTH -> I at 2, R at 3? 
        Also, no forbidden positions? 
        The letter B? 

   We'll go with ORBIT? 

   However, note: ORBIT has too many common letters? 

   But I think ORBIT is fine.

   So I guess: ORBIT

   Let's write it: O-R-B-I-T.

   Reminder of constraints:
        R is present -> in ORBIT, we put R at position 2? 
        I is present -> put at position 4? 
        Avoid position 1 for R? Avoid position 3 for I? satisfied.

   Also, doesn't use A, S, E? 

   Yes? ORBIT: letters O, R, B, I, T -> none of A, S, E.

   So ORBIT is a valid word.

   We output: <guess>ORBIT</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`)
- A is not in the secret word (marked with `x`)
- I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked with `-`)
- S and E are not in the secret word (marked with `x`)

Key deductions:
1. The secret word **contains R and I** (at least one each).
2. The secret word **excludes A, S, and E**.
3. R cannot be in position 1, and I cannot be in position 3.

For the next guess:
- Must include R and I, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.
- Must exclude A, S, E.
- Tests new positions for R and I while covering frequent letters (like O, T) to maximize information.

""ORBIT"" fits these requirements:
- R is in position 2 (avoiding position 1).
- I is in position 4 (avoiding position 3).
- Introduces three new letters: O (common vowel), B, and T (common consonant).

This choice strategically probes R/I placements and common untested letters.

<guess>ORBIT</guess>",ORBIT,"We are given feedback for Guess 2: RAISE -> R(-), A(x), I(-), S(x), E(x)
 This means:
   R is in the secret word but not in the first position (since it's marked with - for wrong position).
   A is not in the word at all.
   I is in the secret word but not in the third position.
   S is not in the word at all.
   E is not in the word at all.

 So, from this feedback, we know:
   The secret word contains R and I, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
   The secret word does not contain A, S, or E.

 We also know that R and I are present, so we must include them in the next guess, but in different positions.

 Now, for the next guess:
   We must choose a valid 5-letter English word that:
     - Does not contain A, S, E (since they are absent).
     - Contains R and I (since they are present).
     - The letter R should not be in position 1 (because in RAISE, R was in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but not in that position).
     - Similarly, the letter I should not be in position 3 (because in RAISE, I was in position 3 and got '-').

 Also, note that we don't know the positions of R and I yet.

 Considering constraints:
   The word must have R and I, and exclude A, S, E.

 Since the secret word has R but not in position 1, and I but not in position 3, we can try to place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 and I in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not position 3).

 We also want to test new letters to gain more information.

 Common letters that haven't been tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many new letters as possible to maximize information.

 Let's try to think of a word that:
   - Contains R and I (not in their forbidden positions).
   - Uses several other common consonants and vowels (but note: we know E is out, and A is out, so vowels available: O, U, and sometimes Y? But we haven't tested O and U).

 However, note that the secret word might have other vowels.

 Let's aim for a word with R and I and three new letters.

 Since R cannot be first, we can have the pattern:
   Option: R in second position? Or third? Or fourth? Or fifth?

 We also avoid putting I in third.

 Example words:

   If we put R in second position: 
      First letter can be a new letter, then R, then something (but not I in third, so third can be new, then I could be in fourth or fifth).
      Example: ""TROIK"" - not a word.

   Let's try putting R in fourth position and I in second?
      Example: word like ""_ _ I R _"", but then we have to fill the blanks.

   Available letters: We want common letters.

 We know that T, O, L, N are common. 

 Consider ""DRILL"": 
   Length: 5, but contains two L's. 
   R is in position 2 (allowed). I is in position 3? But we must avoid I in position 3? 
   Also, note: I is in position 3, which we must avoid? Because in RAISE, I was in position 3 and got '-', meaning the correct I is not at position 3. 
   So in the next guess, if we put I in position 3, it would be incorrect? Actually, we cannot use I in position 3 again? 
   But wait: the feedback doesn't prevent I from being in position 3, it only told us that the secret word's I is not in position 3. 
   However, could the secret word have two I's? 
   The feedback rules: 
      If a letter is in the word in the wrong position, there might be only one occurrence? Actually, the rules don't specify duplicates. 

 But note the example didn't have duplicates. We must consider duplicates:

   The game rules do not explicitly state how duplicates are handled, but common implementations (like Wordle) do the following:
      Each letter in the guess is matched with the secret word from left to right, and a duplicate letter may only get a '✓' or '-' if there is a matching duplicate in the secret word.

   However, our feedback doesn't specify if the secret word might have duplicates.

   Given the feedback for RAISE: 
        R is present but not in position 1 -> so secret word has at least one R.
        I is present but not in position 3 -> so secret word has at least one I.

   We don't know if they have more than one.

   But we must design our next guess without knowing duplicates.

   It's safer to assume that the secret word might have duplicates? However, we don't have evidence. Also, common words often don't have duplicates.

   So, we'll aim for a word that has R and I only once? That might be better to avoid confusion.

   Therefore, avoid putting R or I in positions that might conflict if we assume single instance.

   Since R cannot be in 1, and I cannot be in 3, we can try to put R in position 2 and I in position 1 (first and second).

   Pattern: I _ R _ _   -> Example: ""IRONY"" -> I at 1 (allowed, because secret's I could be at 1), R at 2 (allowed, because secret's R is not at 1 and we don't know about 2? We only know it's not at 1). But R was at 1 in our previous guess and got '-', meaning secret has R but that R is not at position 1. It could be at position 2? 

   However, we must be cautious: it's possible that the secret word has R at position 2? 

   Actually, the feedback says R is present but not at position 1. It doesn't say where it is.

   Similarly, I is present but not at 3.

   So ""IRONY"" would be:
        I in position 1: possible? But we haven't tested position 1 for I? 
        R in position 2: not forbidden.

   But note: we haven't tested the letter I at position 1? So that's new.

   Let's check if IRONY is a valid word: yes.

   Alternatively, we could put R in position 4 and I in position 2: 
        _ I _ R _ 

   Example: ""FIRED"" -> but E is absent? We cannot use E. So we must avoid E.

   Also, we cannot use S and A.

   So, let's look for words that:
        Contain R and I (exactly once? hoping for no duplicates for now)
        Do not contain A, S, E
        Put R not in position 1 and I not in position 3.

   Examples:
        IRONY: 
          I at 1 (okay), R at 2 (okay), O at 3 (not tested), N at 4 (not tested), Y at 5 (not tested).
          This word uses letters: I, R, O, N, Y.

        Proud: contains O and U -> ""PROUD"" but then I is not in it? So we must have both R and I.

        How about ""THIRD"": 
          T, H, I, R, D -> 
          R is at position 4: okay (not 1)
          I is at position 3: but wait, we must avoid putting I at position 3? Because in RAISE, I at 3 got '-' meaning it's present but not at 3? 
          So if we put I at 3 in this guess, we might get a '-' again? That doesn't tell us anything new? And we use a guess.

          Actually, we hope to avoid repeating known wrong positions? Because if we put I at 3 and get '-' then we already know it's not at 3? So that's redundant.

          Therefore, it's better to put I in a new position: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

        Similarly, R must not be at position 1? It can be at 2,3,4,5? But we also haven't tested R in other positions.

        So in ""THIRD"": 
          I is at 3 -> forbidden? Because feedback says I cannot be at 3? 
          Actually, the secret word doesn't have I at position 3? So if we put I at 3, we know for sure that it will be marked '-' (unless the secret has two I's and one is at 3? But we don't know that).

        Without knowing duplicates, to avoid ambiguity, we avoid putting I in position 3? Same for R in position 1.

        Hence, we should avoid position 3 for I and position 1 for R.

   So, back to examples:

      Option 1: IRONY (I in 1, R in 2) -> both positions are new for these letters? 
          But note: R was in position 1 last time? Now we put R in position 2: that's a new position.

      Option 2: a word with R in position 5 and I in position 2? Like ""GUILD"" but G,U,I,L,D -> but it has L... but we need R? Actually, ""GUILD"" doesn't contain R.

   Another example: ""ROBIN"" -> 
         R at position 1: forbidden? Because R was in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but not at 1? 
         So R at position 1 is bad? Then ROBIN is invalid.

   How about ""ORBIT"": 
         O _ _ _ _ -> wait, first letter O, then R? 
         Positions: O, R, B, I, T -> so R at 2, I at 4. 
         This satisfies: R not at 1 (it's at 2), I not at 3 (it's at 4). 
         Also, contains O, R, B, I, T -> letters not in {A, S, E}? Yes.

   ORBIT is a valid word? Yes.

   Another candidate: ""DIRTY"": 
         D, I, R, T, Y -> 
         D at 1, I at 2 (okay, because avoiding I at 3), R at 3 (okay? we didn't test R at 3? yes, because we only know about R at 1) -> allowed? 
         Yes: R was tested in position 1 and failed? So position 3 is new? 
         But note: R might be in position 3? 
         Also, we have I in position 2: which is a new position.

   But ORBIT and DIRTY and IRONY are all valid.

   Which one maximizes new information?

   IRONY: letters I, R (which are known), and O, N, Y (new).
   ORBIT: O, R, B, I, T -> letters: O, R, B, I, T -> known: R, I; new: O, B, T.
   DIRTY: D, I, R, T, Y -> known: R, I; new: D, T, Y.

   We haven't tested: O, B, T, D, Y, N.

   T is a very common letter? So including T might be good? 

   Also, note: the secret word doesn't have A, E, S -> so likely has T or O or other vowels? 

   Let's rank common letters: T, O, L, N, C, etc.

   IRONY: O and N are common? Also Y is less common.
   ORBIT: O and T are common? and B is less common? 
   DIRTY: T and D? and Y.

   ORBIT covers two common letters (O and T) and one less common (B). 

   But note: we only have 6 guesses, so we want to cover more common letters? 

   Alternatively, we can look for a word that includes T and O? Like ORTIC? not a word.

   Another word: ""POINT"" -> but does not contain R? We are forced to include R and I? Because they are known present? 

   Without R and I, we'd be ignoring known presence? So we must include both.

   Therefore, ORBIT (with O, R, B, I, T) seems to cover T and O? And B? 

   Alternatively, ""TROOP"" -> duplicate O and R? We avoid duplicates? and also R must not in position 1? TROOP has R at 1? -> invalid because R at 1 is disallowed for this guess? 

   Also, it doesn't have I? 

   How about ""TOUCH"" -> no R or I.

   Therefore, from the candidates:

      ORBIT: 
          Position 1: O (new)
          Position 2: R (we don't know about position 2 but R was only tested in 1? so this is new for R? So we might get ✓ or - for R? We hope for ✓)
          Position 3: B (new)
          Position 4: I (I was tested only in position 3? so testing I in 4? that's new? so we might get ✓ or - for I? We hope for ✓)
          Position 5: T (new)

      This seems good? 

      DIRTY: 
          Position 1: D (new)
          Position 2: I (new for I? because I was tested in 3? So testing I in 2? okay)
          Position 3: R (new for R? because R was tested in 1? So okay)
          Position 4: T (new)
          Position 5: Y (new)

      This also seems good? 

   ORBIT might be better because it includes the common letter T? But DIRTY has T too? and also D and Y? 

   Actually, both have T? 

   ORBIT: common letters O and T? DIRTY: common letters T and D? Let me check commonness:
      According to English letter frequency: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, ...

      But since A, E are absent, T and O are more common? 

   Also, ORBIT introduces three consonants and one vowel? secret word might have O.

   However, note feedback: RAISE had I which we know is present? but we don't know about vowels? because the secret word doesn't have E or A? so O or U might be present? 

   Since ORBIT includes O? if O is present? then also B and T? 

   We are looking for maximum information? 

   How about ""POINT"" -> doesn't have R? invalid? Because we must include R? 

   Another word: ""TRIPY""? not a word.

   Let me check ""RIGHT"": 
        R at 1 -> forbidden? But we can't put R at 1? not allowed? 
        So ""WRING"": 
           W at 1? then R at 2? I at 3? Forbidden: I cannot be at 3? 
        So we must avoid I at 3.

   So ""WRING"" is invalid? Because I at 3? 

   How about ""FRUIT"": 
        F, R, U, I, T -> 
        R at position 2? Okay? 
        I at position 4? Okay? 
        Contains U? Haven't tested U? 
        But has F and T? 
        Also, it uses U? 

        And it doesn't contain forbidden letters: A, S, E? 

        Yes: ""FRUIT"" is a word? Yes.

   Now compare FRUIT, ORBIT, DIRTY, IRONY.

   FRUIT: F, R, U, I, T -> new: F, U, T? known: R, I? 
   DIRTY: D, I, R, T, Y -> known: R, I; new: D, T, Y? 
   ORBIT: O, R, B, I, T -> known: R, I; new: O, B, T? 
   IRONY: I, R, O, N, Y -> known: R, I; new: O, N, Y? 

   Which one gives most information? 

   We want to test letters that are common? 

   Common consonants: T is very common? So T appears in FRUIT, ORBIT, and DIRTY? 
   FRUIT also tests U which is a vowel? and F which is common? 

   Actually, T is in the top 3? O in the top 5? 

   Therefore, ORBIT tests O (high) and T (high) and B (less common)? 
   FRUIT tests U (vowel? common) and T (high) and F (common)? 
   DIRTY tests D (common? above average), T and Y (less common)? 

   Let me see:

      FRUIT: F is the 6th most common consonant? T is 2nd? U is vowel? 
      But U is the 7th most common letter? 

      ORBIT: O is the 4th? T is 2nd? B is not that common? 

      So FRUIT might be better because it has U? which is a vowel? 

   However, we cannot say? 

   Another candidate: ""BUILT"" -> has U and I? but I? R is missing? 

   We must include R? 

   How about ""FLIRT"": 
        F, L, I, R, T -> 
        Positions: R at 4? I at 3? Wait? I at position 3? forbidden? 

   Because we cannot put I at position 3? so avoid? 

   How about ""TRYST""? Has duplicate T? and Y? but no I? 

   We must include I? 

   Final decision: 

   Given that we know the secret word has R and I? and excludes A, E, S? and we have no idea about duplicates? 

   We choose a word that uses R and I in new positions? and includes three new common letters? 

   ORBIT: 
        Position 1: O -> if O is present, might help? 
        Position 2: R -> because R was tested only in 1? we try position 2? might be correct? or wrong? 
        Position 4: I -> move? testing position 4? 
        Position 5: T -> common? 

   DIRTY: 
        Position 1: D -> might be common? 
        Position 2: I -> since I was at 3? we test position 2? 
        Position 3: R -> testing position 3 for R? 
        Position 4: T -> common? 

   Another one: ""OUTER"" -> contains E? forbidden? 

   How about ""QUIRK""? 
        Q, U, I, R, K -> 
        Positions: I at position 3? forbidden? 
        Not allowed? 

   Let me think of words that put I at 1, R at 5? 
        Example: ""INTRO"" -> 
             I at 1? R at 5? 
             But the word has N,T,R,O? and I? 
             I at 1: not tested before? 
             R at 5: new position? 
             But also has N, T, R, O? 
        The word ""INTRO"" is valid? 

        INTRO: I at position 1 (okay), N at 2, T at 3, R at 4 (wait? R at 4? because spelling: I-N-T-R-O? So positions:
          1: I
          2: N
          3: T
          4: R
          5: O

        I at 1: allowed? because we only know I is not at 3? 
        R at 4: allowed? because R not at 1? and 4 is new? 

        So ""INTRO"" is a candidate: I, N, T, R, O? 
        Letters: I, N, T, R, O? 
        Known: I and R? 
        New: N, T, O? 

   So INTRO: new common letters O, T? and N? 

   ORBIT, INTRO, IRONY are similar? 

   We need to choose one? 

   Let's pick ORBIT? Because it uses R at position 2 and I at position 4? which are two new positions? and INTRO has I at 1? which is also new? 

   ORBIT has T at the end? which might be important.

   Alternatively, we can pick ""POINT"" -> wait, no R? We must include R? 

   Final choice? ORBIT: because it uses two common letters O and T? and the word is common? 

   But another? How about ""BIRTH"":
        B, I, R, T, H -> 
        I at position 2: okay? 
        R at position 3: okay? 
        But note: the word has BIRTH -> I at 2, R at 3? 
        Also, no forbidden positions? 
        The letter B? 

   We'll go with ORBIT? 

   However, note: ORBIT has too many common letters? 

   But I think ORBIT is fine.

   So I guess: ORBIT

   Let's write it: O-R-B-I-T.

   Reminder of constraints:
        R is present -> in ORBIT, we put R at position 2? 
        I is present -> put at position 4? 
        Avoid position 1 for R? Avoid position 3 for I? satisfied.

   Also, doesn't use A, S, E? 

   Yes? ORBIT: letters O, R, B, I, T -> none of A, S, E.

   So ORBIT is a valid word.

   We output: <guess>ORBIT</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`)
- A is not in the secret word (marked with `x`)
- I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked with `-`)
- S and E are not in the secret word (marked with `x`)

Key deductions:
1. The secret word **contains R and I** (at least one each).
2. The secret word **excludes A, S, and E**.
3. R cannot be in position 1, and I cannot be in position 3.

For the next guess:
- Must include R and I, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.
- Must exclude A, S, E.
- Tests new positions for R and I while covering frequent letters (like O, T) to maximize information.

""ORBIT"" fits these requirements:
- R is in position 2 (avoiding position 1).
- I is in position 4 (avoiding position 3).
- Introduces three new letters: O (common vowel), B, and T (common consonant).

This choice strategically probes R/I placements and common untested letters.",Guess 3: ORBIT -> FEEDBACK: O(-) R(-) B(x) I(-) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,micro,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that:
- Contains common letters to maximize the chance of getting feedback (hits or misses).
- Covers a variety of letters to gather as much information as possible.

Common starting words in word games often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters and no repeating letters.

Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also a strong starter, but let me think of a word that includes more common vowels and consonants.

I think ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because:
- It has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (R, S, I) [note: I is sometimes a vowel but in this case, we can consider it as a consonant for commonality].
- Specifically, R, S, and E are very common.

Another option is ""SLATE"".

But since this is the first guess, any of these would be fine.

I'll go with ""RAISE"". Let's break it down:

R, A, I, S, E: These are all common letters.

After entering ""RAISE"", we will get feedback for each letter: whether it's correct (and in the right place), present but wrong place, or absent.

This feedback will then guide our next guess.

Since this is the first guess, I'll choose ""RAISE"".

Remember the format: the response should be the guessed word between <guess> and </guess> tags.

So, my first guess is: RAISE

<guess>and</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: and -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess again because the previous attempt ""and"" was invalid (not five letters?).
 The user says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: and -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.""
 This indicates that the previous guess ""and"" was rejected because it wasn't five letters. So we must guess a valid five-letter word.

 Since we are starting over, we should pick a common starting word with five distinct letters to maximize information.

 Popular starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, CRATE, RAISE, etc.

 Let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has common letters and no repeats.

 Alternatively, note that the feedback said: ""Model answer is not five letters"" for ""and"", meaning our previous guess was invalid? 
 But the example in the initial instructions used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", ""BRISK"", so we must guess a valid five-letter word.

 Since the user instructed ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" after invalidating the last one, we'll pick a valid one.

 I'll choose: RAISE

 However, the user's message might be implying that the first guess was ""and"" and it was invalid. So now we are to make the first valid guess.

 Let me re-read: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then they provided feedback on ""and"" being invalid.

 So, we are effectively at the beginning.

 We'll use ""RAISE"".<thinking>
The previous guess ""and"" was invalid because it is not a five-letter word. Since it's the first valid guess, choosing a word with common letters and good coverage of vowels and consonants is strategic for gathering initial feedback. 

Optimal starting words often include:
- Multiple vowels (A, E, I, O) to test common patterns.
- High-frequency consonants (R, S, T, L, N).
- Distinct letters to maximize information per guess.

The word ""RAISE"" fits perfectly:
1. **Five distinct letters** (R, A, I, S, E).
2. Contains **three vowels** (A, I, E) and **two common consonants** (R, S).
3. Covers top-ranked letters used in English (E, A, R, S, I).

This choice will help narrow down possibilities efficiently regardless of the secret word.
</thinking>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: and -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for Guess 2: RAISE -> R(-), A(x), I(-), S(x), E(x)
 This means:
   R is in the secret word but not in the first position (since it's marked with - for wrong position).
   A is not in the word at all.
   I is in the secret word but not in the third position.
   S is not in the word at all.
   E is not in the word at all.

 So, from this feedback, we know:
   The secret word contains R and I, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
   The secret word does not contain A, S, or E.

 We also know that R and I are present, so we must include them in the next guess, but in different positions.

 Now, for the next guess:
   We must choose a valid 5-letter English word that:
     - Does not contain A, S, E (since they are absent).
     - Contains R and I (since they are present).
     - The letter R should not be in position 1 (because in RAISE, R was in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but not in that position).
     - Similarly, the letter I should not be in position 3 (because in RAISE, I was in position 3 and got '-').

 Also, note that we don't know the positions of R and I yet.

 Considering constraints:
   The word must have R and I, and exclude A, S, E.

 Since the secret word has R but not in position 1, and I but not in position 3, we can try to place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 and I in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not position 3).

 We also want to test new letters to gain more information.

 Common letters that haven't been tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many new letters as possible to maximize information.

 Let's try to think of a word that:
   - Contains R and I (not in their forbidden positions).
   - Uses several other common consonants and vowels (but note: we know E is out, and A is out, so vowels available: O, U, and sometimes Y? But we haven't tested O and U).

 However, note that the secret word might have other vowels.

 Let's aim for a word with R and I and three new letters.

 Since R cannot be first, we can have the pattern:
   Option: R in second position? Or third? Or fourth? Or fifth?

 We also avoid putting I in third.

 Example words:

   If we put R in second position: 
      First letter can be a new letter, then R, then something (but not I in third, so third can be new, then I could be in fourth or fifth).
      Example: ""TROIK"" - not a word.

   Let's try putting R in fourth position and I in second?
      Example: word like ""_ _ I R _"", but then we have to fill the blanks.

   Available letters: We want common letters.

 We know that T, O, L, N are common. 

 Consider ""DRILL"": 
   Length: 5, but contains two L's. 
   R is in position 2 (allowed). I is in position 3? But we must avoid I in position 3? 
   Also, note: I is in position 3, which we must avoid? Because in RAISE, I was in position 3 and got '-', meaning the correct I is not at position 3. 
   So in the next guess, if we put I in position 3, it would be incorrect? Actually, we cannot use I in position 3 again? 
   But wait: the feedback doesn't prevent I from being in position 3, it only told us that the secret word's I is not in position 3. 
   However, could the secret word have two I's? 
   The feedback rules: 
      If a letter is in the word in the wrong position, there might be only one occurrence? Actually, the rules don't specify duplicates. 

 But note the example didn't have duplicates. We must consider duplicates:

   The game rules do not explicitly state how duplicates are handled, but common implementations (like Wordle) do the following:
      Each letter in the guess is matched with the secret word from left to right, and a duplicate letter may only get a '✓' or '-' if there is a matching duplicate in the secret word.

   However, our feedback doesn't specify if the secret word might have duplicates.

   Given the feedback for RAISE: 
        R is present but not in position 1 -> so secret word has at least one R.
        I is present but not in position 3 -> so secret word has at least one I.

   We don't know if they have more than one.

   But we must design our next guess without knowing duplicates.

   It's safer to assume that the secret word might have duplicates? However, we don't have evidence. Also, common words often don't have duplicates.

   So, we'll aim for a word that has R and I only once? That might be better to avoid confusion.

   Therefore, avoid putting R or I in positions that might conflict if we assume single instance.

   Since R cannot be in 1, and I cannot be in 3, we can try to put R in position 2 and I in position 1 (first and second).

   Pattern: I _ R _ _   -> Example: ""IRONY"" -> I at 1 (allowed, because secret's I could be at 1), R at 2 (allowed, because secret's R is not at 1 and we don't know about 2? We only know it's not at 1). But R was at 1 in our previous guess and got '-', meaning secret has R but that R is not at position 1. It could be at position 2? 

   However, we must be cautious: it's possible that the secret word has R at position 2? 

   Actually, the feedback says R is present but not at position 1. It doesn't say where it is.

   Similarly, I is present but not at 3.

   So ""IRONY"" would be:
        I in position 1: possible? But we haven't tested position 1 for I? 
        R in position 2: not forbidden.

   But note: we haven't tested the letter I at position 1? So that's new.

   Let's check if IRONY is a valid word: yes.

   Alternatively, we could put R in position 4 and I in position 2: 
        _ I _ R _ 

   Example: ""FIRED"" -> but E is absent? We cannot use E. So we must avoid E.

   Also, we cannot use S and A.

   So, let's look for words that:
        Contain R and I (exactly once? hoping for no duplicates for now)
        Do not contain A, S, E
        Put R not in position 1 and I not in position 3.

   Examples:
        IRONY: 
          I at 1 (okay), R at 2 (okay), O at 3 (not tested), N at 4 (not tested), Y at 5 (not tested).
          This word uses letters: I, R, O, N, Y.

        Proud: contains O and U -> ""PROUD"" but then I is not in it? So we must have both R and I.

        How about ""THIRD"": 
          T, H, I, R, D -> 
          R is at position 4: okay (not 1)
          I is at position 3: but wait, we must avoid putting I at position 3? Because in RAISE, I at 3 got '-' meaning it's present but not at 3? 
          So if we put I at 3 in this guess, we might get a '-' again? That doesn't tell us anything new? And we use a guess.

          Actually, we hope to avoid repeating known wrong positions? Because if we put I at 3 and get '-' then we already know it's not at 3? So that's redundant.

          Therefore, it's better to put I in a new position: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

        Similarly, R must not be at position 1? It can be at 2,3,4,5? But we also haven't tested R in other positions.

        So in ""THIRD"": 
          I is at 3 -> forbidden? Because feedback says I cannot be at 3? 
          Actually, the secret word doesn't have I at position 3? So if we put I at 3, we know for sure that it will be marked '-' (unless the secret has two I's and one is at 3? But we don't know that).

        Without knowing duplicates, to avoid ambiguity, we avoid putting I in position 3? Same for R in position 1.

        Hence, we should avoid position 3 for I and position 1 for R.

   So, back to examples:

      Option 1: IRONY (I in 1, R in 2) -> both positions are new for these letters? 
          But note: R was in position 1 last time? Now we put R in position 2: that's a new position.

      Option 2: a word with R in position 5 and I in position 2? Like ""GUILD"" but G,U,I,L,D -> but it has L... but we need R? Actually, ""GUILD"" doesn't contain R.

   Another example: ""ROBIN"" -> 
         R at position 1: forbidden? Because R was in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but not at 1? 
         So R at position 1 is bad? Then ROBIN is invalid.

   How about ""ORBIT"": 
         O _ _ _ _ -> wait, first letter O, then R? 
         Positions: O, R, B, I, T -> so R at 2, I at 4. 
         This satisfies: R not at 1 (it's at 2), I not at 3 (it's at 4). 
         Also, contains O, R, B, I, T -> letters not in {A, S, E}? Yes.

   ORBIT is a valid word? Yes.

   Another candidate: ""DIRTY"": 
         D, I, R, T, Y -> 
         D at 1, I at 2 (okay, because avoiding I at 3), R at 3 (okay? we didn't test R at 3? yes, because we only know about R at 1) -> allowed? 
         Yes: R was tested in position 1 and failed? So position 3 is new? 
         But note: R might be in position 3? 
         Also, we have I in position 2: which is a new position.

   But ORBIT and DIRTY and IRONY are all valid.

   Which one maximizes new information?

   IRONY: letters I, R (which are known), and O, N, Y (new).
   ORBIT: O, R, B, I, T -> letters: O, R, B, I, T -> known: R, I; new: O, B, T.
   DIRTY: D, I, R, T, Y -> known: R, I; new: D, T, Y.

   We haven't tested: O, B, T, D, Y, N.

   T is a very common letter? So including T might be good? 

   Also, note: the secret word doesn't have A, E, S -> so likely has T or O or other vowels? 

   Let's rank common letters: T, O, L, N, C, etc.

   IRONY: O and N are common? Also Y is less common.
   ORBIT: O and T are common? and B is less common? 
   DIRTY: T and D? and Y.

   ORBIT covers two common letters (O and T) and one less common (B). 

   But note: we only have 6 guesses, so we want to cover more common letters? 

   Alternatively, we can look for a word that includes T and O? Like ORTIC? not a word.

   Another word: ""POINT"" -> but does not contain R? We are forced to include R and I? Because they are known present? 

   Without R and I, we'd be ignoring known presence? So we must include both.

   Therefore, ORBIT (with O, R, B, I, T) seems to cover T and O? And B? 

   Alternatively, ""TROOP"" -> duplicate O and R? We avoid duplicates? and also R must not in position 1? TROOP has R at 1? -> invalid because R at 1 is disallowed for this guess? 

   Also, it doesn't have I? 

   How about ""TOUCH"" -> no R or I.

   Therefore, from the candidates:

      ORBIT: 
          Position 1: O (new)
          Position 2: R (we don't know about position 2 but R was only tested in 1? so this is new for R? So we might get ✓ or - for R? We hope for ✓)
          Position 3: B (new)
          Position 4: I (I was tested only in position 3? so testing I in 4? that's new? so we might get ✓ or - for I? We hope for ✓)
          Position 5: T (new)

      This seems good? 

      DIRTY: 
          Position 1: D (new)
          Position 2: I (new for I? because I was tested in 3? So testing I in 2? okay)
          Position 3: R (new for R? because R was tested in 1? So okay)
          Position 4: T (new)
          Position 5: Y (new)

      This also seems good? 

   ORBIT might be better because it includes the common letter T? But DIRTY has T too? and also D and Y? 

   Actually, both have T? 

   ORBIT: common letters O and T? DIRTY: common letters T and D? Let me check commonness:
      According to English letter frequency: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, ...

      But since A, E are absent, T and O are more common? 

   Also, ORBIT introduces three consonants and one vowel? secret word might have O.

   However, note feedback: RAISE had I which we know is present? but we don't know about vowels? because the secret word doesn't have E or A? so O or U might be present? 

   Since ORBIT includes O? if O is present? then also B and T? 

   We are looking for maximum information? 

   How about ""POINT"" -> doesn't have R? invalid? Because we must include R? 

   Another word: ""TRIPY""? not a word.

   Let me check ""RIGHT"": 
        R at 1 -> forbidden? But we can't put R at 1? not allowed? 
        So ""WRING"": 
           W at 1? then R at 2? I at 3? Forbidden: I cannot be at 3? 
        So we must avoid I at 3.

   So ""WRING"" is invalid? Because I at 3? 

   How about ""FRUIT"": 
        F, R, U, I, T -> 
        R at position 2? Okay? 
        I at position 4? Okay? 
        Contains U? Haven't tested U? 
        But has F and T? 
        Also, it uses U? 

        And it doesn't contain forbidden letters: A, S, E? 

        Yes: ""FRUIT"" is a word? Yes.

   Now compare FRUIT, ORBIT, DIRTY, IRONY.

   FRUIT: F, R, U, I, T -> new: F, U, T? known: R, I? 
   DIRTY: D, I, R, T, Y -> known: R, I; new: D, T, Y? 
   ORBIT: O, R, B, I, T -> known: R, I; new: O, B, T? 
   IRONY: I, R, O, N, Y -> known: R, I; new: O, N, Y? 

   Which one gives most information? 

   We want to test letters that are common? 

   Common consonants: T is very common? So T appears in FRUIT, ORBIT, and DIRTY? 
   FRUIT also tests U which is a vowel? and F which is common? 

   Actually, T is in the top 3? O in the top 5? 

   Therefore, ORBIT tests O (high) and T (high) and B (less common)? 
   FRUIT tests U (vowel? common) and T (high) and F (common)? 
   DIRTY tests D (common? above average), T and Y (less common)? 

   Let me see:

      FRUIT: F is the 6th most common consonant? T is 2nd? U is vowel? 
      But U is the 7th most common letter? 

      ORBIT: O is the 4th? T is 2nd? B is not that common? 

      So FRUIT might be better because it has U? which is a vowel? 

   However, we cannot say? 

   Another candidate: ""BUILT"" -> has U and I? but I? R is missing? 

   We must include R? 

   How about ""FLIRT"": 
        F, L, I, R, T -> 
        Positions: R at 4? I at 3? Wait? I at position 3? forbidden? 

   Because we cannot put I at position 3? so avoid? 

   How about ""TRYST""? Has duplicate T? and Y? but no I? 

   We must include I? 

   Final decision: 

   Given that we know the secret word has R and I? and excludes A, E, S? and we have no idea about duplicates? 

   We choose a word that uses R and I in new positions? and includes three new common letters? 

   ORBIT: 
        Position 1: O -> if O is present, might help? 
        Position 2: R -> because R was tested only in 1? we try position 2? might be correct? or wrong? 
        Position 4: I -> move? testing position 4? 
        Position 5: T -> common? 

   DIRTY: 
        Position 1: D -> might be common? 
        Position 2: I -> since I was at 3? we test position 2? 
        Position 3: R -> testing position 3 for R? 
        Position 4: T -> common? 

   Another one: ""OUTER"" -> contains E? forbidden? 

   How about ""QUIRK""? 
        Q, U, I, R, K -> 
        Positions: I at position 3? forbidden? 
        Not allowed? 

   Let me think of words that put I at 1, R at 5? 
        Example: ""INTRO"" -> 
             I at 1? R at 5? 
             But the word has N,T,R,O? and I? 
             I at 1: not tested before? 
             R at 5: new position? 
             But also has N, T, R, O? 
        The word ""INTRO"" is valid? 

        INTRO: I at position 1 (okay), N at 2, T at 3, R at 4 (wait? R at 4? because spelling: I-N-T-R-O? So positions:
          1: I
          2: N
          3: T
          4: R
          5: O

        I at 1: allowed? because we only know I is not at 3? 
        R at 4: allowed? because R not at 1? and 4 is new? 

        So ""INTRO"" is a candidate: I, N, T, R, O? 
        Letters: I, N, T, R, O? 
        Known: I and R? 
        New: N, T, O? 

   So INTRO: new common letters O, T? and N? 

   ORBIT, INTRO, IRONY are similar? 

   We need to choose one? 

   Let's pick ORBIT? Because it uses R at position 2 and I at position 4? which are two new positions? and INTRO has I at 1? which is also new? 

   ORBIT has T at the end? which might be important.

   Alternatively, we can pick ""POINT"" -> wait, no R? We must include R? 

   Final choice? ORBIT: because it uses two common letters O and T? and the word is common? 

   But another? How about ""BIRTH"":
        B, I, R, T, H -> 
        I at position 2: okay? 
        R at position 3: okay? 
        But note: the word has BIRTH -> I at 2, R at 3? 
        Also, no forbidden positions? 
        The letter B? 

   We'll go with ORBIT? 

   However, note: ORBIT has too many common letters? 

   But I think ORBIT is fine.

   So I guess: ORBIT

   Let's write it: O-R-B-I-T.

   Reminder of constraints:
        R is present -> in ORBIT, we put R at position 2? 
        I is present -> put at position 4? 
        Avoid position 1 for R? Avoid position 3 for I? satisfied.

   Also, doesn't use A, S, E? 

   Yes? ORBIT: letters O, R, B, I, T -> none of A, S, E.

   So ORBIT is a valid word.

   We output: <guess>ORBIT</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`)
- A is not in the secret word (marked with `x`)
- I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked with `-`)
- S and E are not in the secret word (marked with `x`)

Key deductions:
1. The secret word **contains R and I** (at least one each).
2. The secret word **excludes A, S, and E**.
3. R cannot be in position 1, and I cannot be in position 3.

For the next guess:
- Must include R and I, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.
- Must exclude A, S, E.
- Tests new positions for R and I while covering frequent letters (like O, T) to maximize information.

""ORBIT"" fits these requirements:
- R is in position 2 (avoiding position 1).
- I is in position 4 (avoiding position 3).
- Introduces three new letters: O (common vowel), B, and T (common consonant).

This choice strategically probes R/I placements and common untested letters.

But we haven\'t tested O and U).\n\n However, note that the secret word might have other vowels.\n\n Let\'s aim for a word with R and I and three new letters.\n\n Since R cannot be first, we can have the pattern:\n   Option: R in second position? Or third? Or fourth? Or fifth?\n\n We also avoid putting I in third.\n\n Example words:\n\n   If we put R in second position: \n      First letter can be a new letter, then R, then something (but not I in third, so third can be new, then I could be in fourth or fifth).\n      Example: ""TROIK"" - not a word.\n\n   Let\'s try putting R in fourth position and I in second?\n      Example: word like ""_ _ I R _"", but then we have to fill the blanks.\n\n   Available letters: We want common letters.\n\n We know that T, O, L, N are common. \n\n Consider ""DRILL"": \n   Length: 5, but contains two L\'s. \n   R is in position 2 (allowed). I is in position 3? But we must avoid I in position 3? \n   Also, note: I is in position 3, which we must avoid? Because in RAISE, I was in position 3 and got \'-\', meaning the correct I is not at position 3. \n   So in the next guess, if we put I in position 3, it would be incorrect? Actually, we cannot use I in position 3 again? \n   But wait: the feedback doesn\'t prevent I from being in position 3, it only told us that the secret word\'s I is not in position 3. \n   However, could the secret word have two I\'s? \n   The feedback rules: \n      If a letter is in the word in the wrong position, there might be only one occurrence? Actually, the rules don\'t specify duplicates. \n\n But note the example didn\'t have duplicates. We must consider duplicates:\n\n   The game rules do not explicitly state how duplicates are handled, but common implementations (like Wordle) do the following:\n      Each letter in the guess is matched with the secret word from left to right, and a duplicate letter may only get a \'✓\' or \'-\' if there is a matching duplicate in the secret word.\n\n   However, our feedback doesn\'t specify if the secret word might have duplicates.\n\n   Given the feedback for RAISE: \n        R is present but not in position 1 -> so secret word has at least one R.\n        I is present but not in position 3 -> so secret word has at least one I.\n\n   We don\'t know if they have more than one.\n\n   But we must design our next guess without knowing duplicates.\n\n   It\'s safer to assume that the secret word might have duplicates? However, we don\'t have evidence. Also, common words often don\'t have duplicates.\n\n   So, we\'ll aim for a word that has R and I only once? That might be better to avoid confusion.\n\n   Therefore, avoid putting R or I in positions that might conflict if we assume single instance.\n\n   Since R cannot be in 1, and I cannot be in 3, we can try to put R in position 2 and I in position 1 (first and second).\n\n   Pattern: I _ R _ _   -> Example: ""IRONY"" -> I at 1 (allowed, because secret\'s I could be at 1), R at 2 (allowed, because secret\'s R is not at 1 and we don\'t know about 2? We only know it\'s not at 1). But R was at 1 in our previous guess and got \'-\', meaning secret has R but that R is not at position 1. It could be at position 2? \n\n   However, we must be cautious: it\'s possible that the secret word has R at position 2? \n\n   Actually, the feedback says R is present but not at position 1. It doesn\'t say where it is.\n\n   Similarly, I is present but not at 3.\n\n   So ""IRONY"" would be:\n        I in position 1: possible? But we haven\'t tested position 1 for I? \n        R in position 2: not forbidden.\n\n   But note: we haven\'t tested the letter I at position 1? So that\'s new.\n\n   Let\'s check if IRONY is a valid word: yes.\n\n   Alternatively, we could put R in position 4 and I in position 2: \n        _ I _ R _ \n\n   Example: ""FIRED"" -> but E is absent? We cannot use E. So we must avoid E.\n\n   Also, we cannot use S and A.\n\n   So, let\'s look for words that:\n        Contain R and I (exactly once? hoping for no duplicates for now)\n        Do not contain A, S, E\n        Put R not in position 1 and I not in position 3.\n\n   Examples:\n        IRONY: \n          I at 1 (okay), R at 2 (okay), O at 3 (not tested), N at 4 (not tested), Y at 5 (not tested).\n          This word uses letters: I, R, O, N, Y.\n\n        Proud: contains O and U -> ""PROUD"" but then I is not in it? So we must have both R and I.\n\n        How about ""THIRD"": \n          T, H, I, R, D -> \n          R is at position 4: okay (not 1)\n          I is at position 3: but wait, we must avoid putting I at position 3? Because in RAISE, I at 3 got \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not at 3? \n          So if we put I at 3 in this guess, we might get a \'-\' again? That doesn\'t tell us anything new? And we use a guess.\n\n          Actually, we hope to avoid repeating known wrong positions? Because if we put I at 3 and get \'-\' then we already know it\'s not at 3? So that\'s redundant.\n\n          Therefore, it\'s better to put I in a new position: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n        Similarly, R must not be at position 1? It can be at 2,3,4,5? But we also haven\'t tested R in other positions.\n\n        So in ""THIRD"": \n          I is at 3 -> forbidden? Because feedback says I cannot be at 3? \n          Actually, the secret word doesn\'t have I at position 3? So if we put I at 3, we know for sure that it will be marked \'-\' (unless the secret has two I\'s and one is at 3? But we don\'t know that).\n\n        Without knowing duplicates, to avoid ambiguity, we avoid putting I in position 3? Same for R in position 1.\n\n        Hence, we should avoid position 3 for I and position 1 for R.\n\n   So, back to examples:\n\n      Option 1: IRONY (I in 1, R in 2) -> both positions are new for these letters? \n          But note: R was in position 1 last time? Now we put R in position 2: that\'s a new position.\n\n      Option 2: a word with R in position 5 and I in position 2? Like ""GUILD"" but G,U,I,L,D -> but it has L... but we need R? Actually, ""GUILD"" doesn\'t contain R.\n\n   Another example: ""ROBIN"" -> \n         R at position 1: forbidden? Because R was in position 1 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not at 1? \n         So R at position 1 is bad? Then ROBIN is invalid.\n\n   How about ""ORBIT"": \n         O _ _ _ _ -> wait, first letter O, then R? \n         Positions: O, R, B, I, T -> so R at 2, I at 4. \n         This satisfies: R not at 1 (it\'s at 2), I not at 3 (it\'s at 4). \n         Also, contains O, R, B, I, T -> letters not in {A, S, E}? Yes.\n\n   ORBIT is a valid word? Yes.\n\n   Another candidate: ""DIRTY"": \n         D, I, R, T, Y -> \n         D at 1, I at 2 (okay, because avoiding I at 3), R at 3 (okay? we didn\'t test R at 3? yes, because we only know about R at 1) -> allowed? \n         Yes: R was tested in position 1 and failed? So position 3 is new? \n         But note: R might be in position 3? \n         Also, we have I in position 2: which is a new position.\n\n   But ORBIT and DIRTY and IRONY are all valid.\n\n   Which one maximizes new information?\n\n   IRONY: letters I, R (which are known), and O, N, Y (new).\n   ORBIT: O, R, B, I, T -> letters: O, R, B, I, T -> known: R, I; new: O, B, T.\n   DIRTY: D, I, R, T, Y -> known: R, I; new: D, T, Y.\n\n   We haven\'t tested: O, B, T, D, Y, N.\n\n   T is a very common letter? So including T might be good? \n\n   Also, note: the secret word doesn\'t have A, E, S -> so likely has T or O or other vowels? \n\n   Let\'s rank common letters: T, O, L, N, C, etc.\n\n   IRONY: O and N are common? Also Y is less common.\n   ORBIT: O and T are common? and B is less common? \n   DIRTY: T and D? and Y.\n\n   ORBIT covers two common letters (O and T) and one less common (B). \n\n   But note: we only have 6 guesses, so we want to cover more common letters? \n\n   Alternatively, we can look for a word that includes T and O? Like ORTIC? not a word.\n\n   Another word: ""POINT"" -> but does not contain R? We are forced to include R and I? Because they are known present? \n\n   Without R and I, we\'d be ignoring known presence? So we must include both.\n\n   Therefore, ORBIT (with O, R, B, I, T) seems to cover T and O? And B? \n\n   Alternatively, ""TROOP"" -> duplicate O and R? We avoid duplicates? and also R must not in position 1? TROOP has R at 1? -> invalid because R at 1 is disallowed for this guess? \n\n   Also, it doesn\'t have I? \n\n   How about ""TOUCH"" -> no R or I.\n\n   Therefore, from the candidates:\n\n      ORBIT: \n          Position 1: O (new)\n          Position 2: R (we don\'t know about position 2 but R was only tested in 1? so this is new for R? So we might get ✓ or - for R? We hope for ✓)\n          Position 3: B (new)\n          Position 4: I (I was tested only in position 3? so testing I in 4? that\'s new? so we might get ✓ or - for I? We hope for ✓)\n          Position 5: T (new)\n\n      This seems good? \n\n      DIRTY: \n          Position 1: D (new)\n          Position 2: I (new for I? because I was tested in 3? So testing I in 2? okay)\n          Position 3: R (new for R? because R was tested in 1? So okay)\n          Position 4: T (new)\n          Position 5: Y (new)\n\n      This also seems good? \n\n   ORBIT might be better because it includes the common letter T? But DIRTY has T too? and also D and Y? \n\n   Actually, both have T? \n\n   ORBIT: common letters O and T? DIRTY: common letters T and D? Let me check commonness:\n      According to English letter frequency: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, ...\n\n      But since A, E are absent, T and O are more common? \n\n   Also, ORBIT introduces three consonants and one vowel? secret word might have O.\n\n   However, note feedback: RAISE had I which we know is present? but we don\'t know about vowels? because the secret word doesn\'t have E or A? so O or U might be present? \n\n   Since ORBIT includes O? if O is present? then also B and T? \n\n   We are looking for maximum information? \n\n   How about ""POINT"" -> doesn\'t have R? invalid? Because we must include R? \n\n   Another word: ""TRIPY""? not a word.\n\n   Let me check ""RIGHT"": \n        R at 1 -> forbidden? But we can\'t put R at 1? not allowed? \n        So ""WRING"": \n           W at 1? then R at 2? I at 3? Forbidden: I cannot be at 3? \n        So we must avoid I at 3.\n\n   So ""WRING"" is invalid? Because I at 3? \n\n   How about ""FRUIT"": \n        F, R, U, I, T -> \n        R at position 2? Okay? \n        I at position 4? Okay? \n        Contains U? Haven\'t tested U? \n        But has F and T? \n        Also, it uses U? \n\n        And it doesn\'t contain forbidden letters: A, S, E? \n\n        Yes: ""FRUIT"" is a word? Yes.\n\n   Now compare FRUIT, ORBIT, DIRTY, IRONY.\n\n   FRUIT: F, R, U, I, T -> new: F, U, T? known: R, I? \n   DIRTY: D, I, R, T, Y -> known: R, I; new: D, T, Y? \n   ORBIT: O, R, B, I, T -> known: R, I; new: O, B, T? \n   IRONY: I, R, O, N, Y -> known: R, I; new: O, N, Y? \n\n   Which one gives most information? \n\n   We want to test letters that are common? \n\n   Common consonants: T is very common? So T appears in FRUIT, ORBIT, and DIRTY? \n   FRUIT also tests U which is a vowel? and F which is common? \n\n   Actually, T is in the top 3? O in the top 5? \n\n   Therefore, ORBIT tests O (high) and T (high) and B (less common)? \n   FRUIT tests U (vowel? common) and T (high) and F (common)? \n   DIRTY tests D (common? above average), T and Y (less common)? \n\n   Let me see:\n\n      FRUIT: F is the 6th most common consonant? T is 2nd? U is vowel? \n      But U is the 7th most common letter? \n\n      ORBIT: O is the 4th? T is 2nd? B is not that common? \n\n      So FRUIT might be better because it has U? which is a vowel? \n\n   However, we cannot say? \n\n   Another candidate: ""BUILT"" -> has U and I? but I? R is missing? \n\n   We must include R? \n\n   How about ""FLIRT"": \n        F, L, I, R, T -> \n        Positions: R at 4? I at 3? Wait? I at position 3? forbidden? \n\n   Because we cannot put I at position 3? so avoid? \n\n   How about ""TRYST""? Has duplicate T? and Y? but no I? \n\n   We must include I? \n\n   Final decision: \n\n   Given that we know the secret word has R and I? and excludes A, E, S? and we have no idea about duplicates? \n\n   We choose a word that uses R and I in new positions? and includes three new common letters? \n\n   ORBIT: \n        Position 1: O -> if O is present, might help? \n        Position 2: R -> because R was tested only in 1? we try position 2? might be correct? or wrong? \n        Position 4: I -> move? testing position 4? \n        Position 5: T -> common? \n\n   DIRTY: \n        Position 1: D -> might be common? \n        Position 2: I -> since I was at 3? we test position 2? \n        Position 3: R -> testing position 3 for R? \n        Position 4: T -> common? \n\n   Another one: ""OUTER"" -> contains E? forbidden? \n\n   How about ""QUIRK""? \n        Q, U, I, R, K -> \n        Positions: I at position 3? forbidden? \n        Not allowed? \n\n   Let me think of words that put I at 1, R at 5? \n        Example: ""INTRO"" -> \n             I at 1? R at 5? \n             But the word has N,T,R,O? and I? \n             I at 1: not tested before? \n             R at 5: new position? \n             But also has N, T, R, O? \n        The word ""INTRO"" is valid? \n\n        INTRO: I at position 1 (okay), N at 2, T at 3, R at 4 (wait? R at 4? because spelling: I-N-T-R-O? So positions:\n          1: I\n          2: N\n          3: T\n          4: R\n          5: O\n\n        I at 1: allowed? because we only know I is not at 3? \n        R at 4: allowed? because R not at 1? and 4 is new? \n\n        So ""INTRO"" is a candidate: I, N, T, R, O? \n        Letters: I, N, T, R, O? \n        Known: I and R? \n        New: N, T, O? \n\n   So INTRO: new common letters O, T? and N? \n\n   ORBIT, INTRO, IRONY are similar? \n\n   We need to choose one? \n\n   Let\'s pick ORBIT? Because it uses R at position 2 and I at position 4? which are two new positions? and INTRO has I at 1? which is also new? \n\n   ORBIT has T at the end? which might be important.\n\n   Alternatively, we can pick ""POINT"" -> wait, no R? We must include R? \n\n   Final choice? ORBIT: because it uses two common letters O and T? and the word is common? \n\n   But another? How about ""BIRTH"":\n        B, I, R, T, H -> \n        I at position 2: okay? \n        R at position 3: okay? \n        But note: the word has BIRTH -> I at 2, R at 3? \n        Also, no forbidden positions? \n        The letter B? \n\n   We\'ll go with ORBIT? \n\n   However, note: ORBIT has too many common letters? \n\n   But I think ORBIT is fine.\n\n   So I guess: ORBIT\n\n   Let\'s write it: O-R-B-I-T.\n\n   Reminder of constraints:\n        R is present -> in ORBIT, we put R at position 2? \n        I is present -> put at position 4? \n        Avoid position 1 for R? Avoid position 3 for I? satisfied.\n\n   Also, doesn\'t use A, S, E? \n\n   Yes? ORBIT: letters O, R, B, I, T -> none of A, S, E.\n\n   So ORBIT is a valid word.\n\n   We output: <guess>ORBIT</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""RAISE"":\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`)\n- A is not in the secret word (marked with `x`)\n- I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked with `-`)\n- S and E are not in the secret word (marked with `x`)\n\nKey deductions:\n1. The secret word **contains R and I** (at least one each).\n2. The secret word **excludes A, S, and E**.\n3. R cannot be in position 1, and I cannot be in position 3.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and I, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.\n- Must exclude A, S, E.\n- Tests new positions for R and I while covering frequent letters (like O, T) to maximize information.\n\n""ORBIT"" fits these requirements:\n- R is in position 2 (avoiding position 1).\n- I is in position 4 (avoiding position 3).\n- Introduces three new letters: O (common vowel), B, and T (common consonant).\n\nThis choice strategically probes R/I placements and common untested letters.\n\n<guess>ORBIT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: and -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\nGuess 2: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 3: ORBIT -> FEEDBACK: O(-) R(-) B(x) I(-) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback for Guess 3: ORBIT -> O(-) R(-) B(x) I(-) T(x)

This means:
- O is in the secret word but not in position 1 (because in ORBIT, O was at position 1).
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (since it got '-' and was at position 2).
- B is not in the word at all.
- I is in the secret word but not in position 4 (since it was at position 4 and marked '-').
- T is not in the word at all.

Combining with prior feedback:
From Guess 2 (RAISE):
- R is present → confirmed, and we now know it can't be in positions 1 or 2.
- I is present → confirmed, and we know it can't be in positions 3 or 4.
- A, S, E, B, T are absent.

Current knowledge:
- Present letters: R, I, O (from this guess we learned O is present)
- Absent letters: A, E, S, B, T
- Position constraints:
  - R: not in pos 1 or 2 → so must be in pos 3, 4, or 5.
  - I: not in pos 3 or 4 → so must be in pos 1, 2, or 5.
  - O: not in pos 1 → so must be in pos 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We must form a valid 5-letter word containing R, I, O, excluding the absent letters.

Available letters: exclude A, E, S, B, T. 
Common letters left: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Additionally, we need to assign R, I, O to positions that satisfy the constraints.

Possible approach: 
- Since R must be in 3,4,5 and I in 1,2,5, and O in 2,3,4,5, we need to find a combination where these don't conflict.

Consider positions:
- Position 1: must be one of the available letters (not R? because R can't be in 1? But wait, from ORBIT we learned R is not in 2? and from RAISE we learned R is not in 1, but now we know O is present and not in 1. Also, I can be in 1? 
  Actually, we haven't tested I in position 1? So position 1 could be I or any other new letter that is present? but we don't know what is present besides R,I,O? we don't know? So position 1 must be I or a new letter that we haven't tested? But it must be a letter in the word? We only know R,I,O are present? but there might be other letters? Indeed, the word has 5 letters? so there are two more? That we haven't found? Or duplicates?

But we don't know duplicates? We assume possibly one of each? 

Therefore, the word must contain R, I, O, and two more letters that must be from the available set? excluding absent letters? 

The two extra letters must be chosen from: C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We want to pick a word that satisfies positional constraints? 

Now, let's list possibilities:

R positions: 3,4,5
I positions: 1,2,5
O positions: 2,3,4,5

But we have 5 positions? So we must assign these 3 letters to three of the five positions? along with two other letters.

We also have constraints from the feedback? 

Moreover, we must make sure: I cannot be in 3 or 4? R cannot be in 1 or 2? O cannot be in 1? 

Option: Assign I to position 1? 
Then, position 1: I
Then, O can be in 2?3?4?5? R can be in 3?4?5? 

But if we put I at position 1, then position 1 is fixed? 

Then, for position 2: cannot be R? and cannot be O? if O is at 2? but wait? O can be anywhere? except 1? so position 2 can be O? 

But also? position 2 can be a new letter? 

We need to include O? So O must be in one of the positions? 

Similarly for R? 

But if position 1 is I? then:

Position 2: cannot be R? because R can't be at 2? So position 2 can be O? or a new letter? 

If position 2 is O? this matches? O's constraint? and it's not position 1? 

But then R must be at 3,4, or 5? 

Also, position 2: O? then that would satisfy O? but then we have positions 3,4,5 for R and the two new letters? 

But we must place R? 

But note: I is at position 1? so okay? 

So positions:
1: I
2: O? Then R must be at 3,4, or 5? 

But what about the two remaining positions? 

Also, note: the previously found constraints? 

Also, we still don't know if there are duplicates? 

But if we put O at 2? then we have O at position 2? which hasn't been tested? because in ORBIT? O was at 1? 

So O can be at 2? 

Similarly, I at 1? we haven't tested I at position 1? only at position 3? 

So that is possible? 

Then? a word pattern: I O _ _ _

But then R must be at one of the last three? 

And the other two positions? new letters? 

We'd form words? like IO??? 

For example? ""IOCRY"" not a word? 

Common words? ""IRONY""? but we know S is absent? B is absent? T is absent? but we consider? 

Wait? IRONY? Is IRONY a valid word? 
Letters: I, R, O, N, Y? 
Absent letters: A,E,S,B,T? so N and Y are not absent? 
But have we tested N and Y? No? 

But we know from ORBIT that T is absent? and B is absent? but N and Y are okay? 

Therefore? ""IRONY"" might be a possibility? 

Does it satisfy positions?

In IRONY:
- I at position 1? -> this is the first time we test I at 1? 
- R at position 2? but wait? R was tested at position 2 in ORBIT? and got '-'? meaning R is not at position 2? 
So we cannot put R at position 2? 

Therefore? IRONY has R at 2? which we know is wrong? because ORBIT told us R is not in position 2? 

Therefore? IRONY is invalid? 

We need R to be at 3?4? or 5? 

So? back to pattern I O _ _ _ ?

Then? R cannot be at 2? so the third character? Position 3? 

Then: I O R _ _

Now? the last two positions? must be filled? with letters? not A,E,S,B,T? 

Looking for words that start ""IOR""? 

But are there any? ""IOR"" not common? 

Examples: ""IORTU"" not a word? 

Alternatively? what if we put O elsewhere? 

Other option: put I at position 2? 

Then? Position 2: I? 
Position 1: must be a letter? and it cannot be R (because R not at 1)? cannot be O? because O not at 1? So position 1 has to be a new letter? let's say X? 

Then pattern: X I _ _ _

Then O? can be at 3?4?5? R at 3?4?5? but not position 1 or 2? 

Also? I is at 2? which is new for I? 

But can I be at position 2? We haven't tested position 2 for I? 

So? one such word? ""QUIRK"" has I at 3? which is forbidden? 

How about ""BUILD""? has U and L? D? but B is absent? not allowed? 

Let me think: 

Assign I to position 5? 

Then R must be in 3,4,5? but position 5 is I? so R cannot be at 5? unless duplicate? we avoid? so R in 3 or 4? 

Similarly? O in 2?3?4? (since 5 is I)? 

So? pattern: for instance? _ _ R O I -> but R at 3? O at 4? I at 5? 

This might be possible? 

Letters: ? ? R O I? 

We need two more letters? from available set? 

Example: ""GROIN"" -> but G, R, O, I, N? 
But G? and N? 
Position: 
  R at 2? but we know from ORBIT that R cannot be at 2? 

Wait? the pattern we are considering: position 3: R? position 4: O? position 5: I? 
So we need positions 1 and 2: 

So a word? like X Y R O I? 

Is there any? ""CHORI"" not a word? 

Another idea: Since O is present and not at 1? it could be at 3? and R at 4? I at 1? 

So: Pattern: I ? O ? R? 

Position 1: I? 
Position 3: O? 
Position 5: R? 

Then positions 2 and 4: new letters? 

This might work? 

Example: ""INFOR"" 
I N F O R?
But N, F? O, R? 
But positions: 
1: I? new? 
2: N? new? 
3: O? new? 
4: O? wait? no? 
If ""INFOR"": I-N-F-O-R? 
Then 4: O? 5: R? 
But position 3: F? 
But we put O at 4? 
But wait? we set pattern: I ? O ? R? 
Meaning? position 1: I? position 3: O? position 5: R? 

And position 2 and 4: any? 

In ""INFER"": E? absent? not allowed? because E is absent? 

How about ""INCOR"": 
I, N, C, O, R? 
Positions: 
1: I? 
2: N? 
3: C? -> we want position 3 to be O? but here? C? 
But we planned O at position 3? 

But if we put O at position 3? 
How about ""MORIN""? M O R I N? but then I and N? 
But positions: O at 2? R at 3? I at 4? 
Constraints: 
- O at position 2? allowed? 
- R at position 3: allowed? (previous? R not at 1 or 2? so 3 is fine? 
- I at position 4? but ORBIT feedback: I at 4 got '-'? meaning I is present? but not at position 4? 
Therefore? we cannot put I at position 4? 

So that pattern is invalid? 

Back to: I at position 1? O at position 3? R at position 5? 

Pattern: I ? O ? R? 

Position 2: must be a letter? 
Position 4: must be a letter? 

And the word must be valid? without A,E,S,B,T? 

Example words: 
""MINOR"": M,I,N,O,R? 
But N is available? 
Positions: 
1: M? but we planned I at 1? 
No? 

How about ""DINOR""? not a word? 

Another idea: ""CHOIR"": C,H,O,I,R? 
Positions: 
1: C? 
2: H? 
3: O? 
4: I? 
5: R? 

Check constraints: 
- R at position 5? allowed? 
- I at position 4? but ORBIT feedback: I at 4 got '-'? so I cannot be at 4? 
So invalid? because I cannot be at 4? 

We require I not in 3 or 4? so position 4 is forbidden? 

Therefore? I cannot be in position 4? 

So? in the pattern I?O?R? 
Position 4? if I? it is forbidden? so position 4 must be a new letter? 

Similarly? position 2 must be a new letter? 

Now? position 1? I? 
position 3? O? 
position 5? R? 
position 2: new letter? 
position 4: new letter? 

So word: I X O Y R? 

What words have the pattern I?O?R? 

Examples: ""PILOR"" not a word? 
""VIGOR"": V,I,G,O,R? 
V at 1? I at 2? but we are putting I at 1? 
Wait? we are setting position 1 as I? 

So first letter I? 

Then words: ""IRONV"" invalid? 

Try looking for words that start with ""I"", then any letter? then ""O"", then any letter? then ""R""? 

Such as? ""INQOR""? not a word? 

""INCOR"" is I,N,C,O,R -> places: 
1: I? 
2: N? 
3: C? but we set position 3 to be O? not C? 
Then ""IFORK"" not a word? 

Another thought: ""MORAL"" not? 

Perhaps ""PIORV"" not? 

This may be difficult? 

Perhaps put I at position 2? 

Then: 
Position 1: some letter X? 
Position 2: I? 
Then position? for O?  not 1? 
For R? not 1 or 2? 

Example: X I O ? R? or X I ? O R? etc? 

Lets try to find words that satisfy：

- R in the word at positions: 3,4,5 (and not 1,2)
- I in the word at positions: 1,2,5 (and not 3,4)
- O in the word at positions: 2,3,4,5 (not 1)

And with the two additional letters? which are not in {A,E,S,B,T} 

We try to place I at position 5? 
Then R could be at position 3 or 4? 
O could be at position 2?3?4? 

If O at position 2? then pattern: _ O ? ? I ? but I at 5? 
And R at 3 or 4? 

But I at 5? and O at 2? 

Then positions 1,3,4? 

If R at 3? then pattern: _ O R ? I? 

Example: ""MOR I"" with I at 5? ""MORAI"" not a word? 

""CORDI"": has E? 

Another idea: ""COURI"" not? 

Consider letter C, D, G, U? etc? 

We can use a list? but since I must be at 1,2 or 5? and we've tried 1 and 2 with difficulties? let me try I at 5? 

Then R at 3 or 4? 
And O at 2?3?4? 

Say R at 4? O at 2? then pattern: ? O ? R I? 

Word: ""NORI"" is 4 letters? 

Let me extend: ""LORIC"": L,O,R,I,C? 
But positions: 
1: L? 
2: O? 
3: R? 
4: I?  -> I at position 4? not allowed? 
So not? 

""CONI R"" not? 

""DOILY"" but has D,O,I,L,Y? 
But positions: 
1: D? 
2: O? 
3: I? -> I at 3? not allowed? because I cannot be at 3? 

""DOUR"" is 4? 

What about ""GROIN"": G,R,O,I,N? 
But R at position 2? which is forbidden? 

How about ""PRION"": P,R,I,O,N? 
But R at position 2? forbidden? 

Another idea: ""CRIO? "" words? 

Let me try ""ORCIN"": O at position 1? but we know O not at position 1? 

How about ""UCORI"" not a word? 

Perhaps we should look for words that have the letters and positions? 

Given time? also note that from ORBIT? we have O at position 1 was wrong? but we don't know if O is at other positions? 

Perhaps try a word like ""COLOR"" but has dup O? and not have I? 

We must include I? 

Another possibility: I in position 2? 

Then word pattern: ? I ? ? ? 

And the word should have O and R in allowed positions? 

For instance? ""QUIRK"" has K? and I at 3? not allowed? 

""DOING"" has O? but no R? 

""PILOT"" has T? absent? 

We know T is absent? 

So remove words with T? 

Valid words? 

""GUILD"" has U, I, L, D? no R? 

So need another letter? 

""ORIEL"" has E? not allowed? 

""F R I O ? "" 

Perhaps ""GHOUL"" no I? 
To include R,I,O? 

Let's list common words with R,I,O: 
""RIOJA"" but not English? 
""PRIOR"" has two R? and no O? 

How about ""VIRGO"": 
V,I,R,G,O? 
Positions: 
1: V? 
2: I? 
3: R? -> R can be at 3? (not 1 or 2? so 3 allowed)
4: G? 
5: O? 

Check constraints: 
- I at position 2? allowed? 
- R at position 3: allowed? 
- O at position 5: allowed? 

And: 
- V? not tested? but may be present? 
- G? not tested? may be present? 

Also? avoids A,E,S,B,T? 

Yes? 

Does ""VIRGO"" a word? Yes: a zodiac sign? 

Other words? ""VIRUS"" but has S? absent? 

So ""VIRGO"" might be a good guess? 

Check if it satisfies all feedback: 
- Not using forbidden letters: no A,E,S,B,T? 
- I at position 2: allowed? because not position 3 or 4? and is new? 
- R at position 3: allowed? because not 1 or 2? 
- O at position 5: allowed? not position 1? 

So let's go with ""VIRGO"" for now? 

If this is not the word? we'll get feedback? 

This is our best? 

We output VIRGO? 

Step-by-step reasoning included? 

So guess: VIRGO? 

Then format: <guess>VIRGO</guess> 

To summarize? 

After ORBIT? we know O is present but not at 1? R is present but not at 2? I is present but not at 4? 
And I is not at 3? and there are no A,S,E,B,T? 

VIRGO places:
- I at 2 (new position? the only allowed position test-wise for I? because 1,2,5 are available? but 5 might be taken by O or R? 
- R at 3? which is new for R? 
- O at 5? new for O? 
- V and G haven't been tested? 

If any are missing? we'll know they are absent? 

So it maximizes information? 

Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Next Guess:

1. **Previous Feedback Analysis**:
   - **Guess 2 (RAISE)**: R and I are present (confirmed by `-`), but R is not in position 1 and I is not in position 3. A, S, and E are absent (`x`).
   - **Guess 3 (ORBIT)**:
     - O is present but not in position 1 (`-`).
     - R is present but not in position 2 (`-`), confirming RAISE's feedback that R cannot be position 1 and now adding position 2 as incorrect.
     - I is present but not in position 4 (`-`), confirming RAISE's feedback that I cannot be position 3 and now adding position 4 as incorrect.
     - B and T are absent (`x`), along with previously excluded A, S, E.

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Present Letters**: R, I, O (must all be included in the next guess).
   - **Absent Letters**: A, E, S, B, T (excluded from all guesses).
   - **Position Constraints**:
     - R: Cannot be in positions 1–2 → must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
     - I: Cannot be in positions 3–4 → must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
     - O: Cannot be in position 1 → must be in positions 2–5.
   - **Unused Letters**: Letters not yet tested are: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Must include R, I, O in positions that satisfy constraints:
     - I and O could compete for position 2, requiring I to be placed in 1 or 5 without conflict.
     - Place R in a new position (3, 4, or 5) since positions 1–2 are invalid.
     - Introduce new common letters to maximize information (e.g., G, V).
   - Avoid positional conflicts:
     - I cannot be at 3 or 4; R cannot be at 1 or 2; O cannot be at 1.
     - Positions 1, 5 are candidates for I if O is elsewhere (e.g., O at 5).

4. **Candidate Word Selection**:
   - Explore words with I at position 2 (untested), R at position 3 (allowed), and O at position 5 (untested).
   - Use new letters (e.g., V, G) to cover more ground.
   - **Chosen Word: ""VIRGO""**:
     - **V**: Untested consonant; common enough to gather feedback.
     - **I**: Position 2 (allowed; contradicts both position 3 and 4 constraints).
     - **R**: Position 3 (allowed; avoids positions 1-2).
     - **G**: Untested consonant; moderate frequency.
     - **O**: Position 5 (allowed; avoids position 1).
   - **Validity**: ""VIRGO"" uses exclusively absent letters and satisfies all known constraints:
     - Confirmed presence of R, I, O.
     - Tests I in a new position (2) and O in a new position (5).
     - Introduces V and G as new probes.
     - Avoids A, E, S, B, T.

5. **Information Gain**:
   - **If VIRGO hits**: Positions for R, I, O are validated.
   - **If not**: Feedback on V/G (absent/present) and positional tweaks for R, I, O will further narrow possibilities.

<guess>VIRGO</guess>",VIRGO,"We have feedback for Guess 3: ORBIT -> O(-) R(-) B(x) I(-) T(x)

This means:
- O is in the secret word but not in position 1 (because in ORBIT, O was at position 1).
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (since it got '-' and was at position 2).
- B is not in the word at all.
- I is in the secret word but not in position 4 (since it was at position 4 and marked '-').
- T is not in the word at all.

Combining with prior feedback:
From Guess 2 (RAISE):
- R is present → confirmed, and we now know it can't be in positions 1 or 2.
- I is present → confirmed, and we know it can't be in positions 3 or 4.
- A, S, E, B, T are absent.

Current knowledge:
- Present letters: R, I, O (from this guess we learned O is present)
- Absent letters: A, E, S, B, T
- Position constraints:
  - R: not in pos 1 or 2 → so must be in pos 3, 4, or 5.
  - I: not in pos 3 or 4 → so must be in pos 1, 2, or 5.
  - O: not in pos 1 → so must be in pos 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We must form a valid 5-letter word containing R, I, O, excluding the absent letters.

Available letters: exclude A, E, S, B, T. 
Common letters left: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Additionally, we need to assign R, I, O to positions that satisfy the constraints.

Possible approach: 
- Since R must be in 3,4,5 and I in 1,2,5, and O in 2,3,4,5, we need to find a combination where these don't conflict.

Consider positions:
- Position 1: must be one of the available letters (not R? because R can't be in 1? But wait, from ORBIT we learned R is not in 2? and from RAISE we learned R is not in 1, but now we know O is present and not in 1. Also, I can be in 1? 
  Actually, we haven't tested I in position 1? So position 1 could be I or any other new letter that is present? but we don't know what is present besides R,I,O? we don't know? So position 1 must be I or a new letter that we haven't tested? But it must be a letter in the word? We only know R,I,O are present? but there might be other letters? Indeed, the word has 5 letters? so there are two more? That we haven't found? Or duplicates?

But we don't know duplicates? We assume possibly one of each? 

Therefore, the word must contain R, I, O, and two more letters that must be from the available set? excluding absent letters? 

The two extra letters must be chosen from: C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We want to pick a word that satisfies positional constraints? 

Now, let's list possibilities:

R positions: 3,4,5
I positions: 1,2,5
O positions: 2,3,4,5

But we have 5 positions? So we must assign these 3 letters to three of the five positions? along with two other letters.

We also have constraints from the feedback? 

Moreover, we must make sure: I cannot be in 3 or 4? R cannot be in 1 or 2? O cannot be in 1? 

Option: Assign I to position 1? 
Then, position 1: I
Then, O can be in 2?3?4?5? R can be in 3?4?5? 

But if we put I at position 1, then position 1 is fixed? 

Then, for position 2: cannot be R? and cannot be O? if O is at 2? but wait? O can be anywhere? except 1? so position 2 can be O? 

But also? position 2 can be a new letter? 

We need to include O? So O must be in one of the positions? 

Similarly for R? 

But if position 1 is I? then:

Position 2: cannot be R? because R can't be at 2? So position 2 can be O? or a new letter? 

If position 2 is O? this matches? O's constraint? and it's not position 1? 

But then R must be at 3,4, or 5? 

Also, position 2: O? then that would satisfy O? but then we have positions 3,4,5 for R and the two new letters? 

But we must place R? 

But note: I is at position 1? so okay? 

So positions:
1: I
2: O? Then R must be at 3,4, or 5? 

But what about the two remaining positions? 

Also, note: the previously found constraints? 

Also, we still don't know if there are duplicates? 

But if we put O at 2? then we have O at position 2? which hasn't been tested? because in ORBIT? O was at 1? 

So O can be at 2? 

Similarly, I at 1? we haven't tested I at position 1? only at position 3? 

So that is possible? 

Then? a word pattern: I O _ _ _

But then R must be at one of the last three? 

And the other two positions? new letters? 

We'd form words? like IO??? 

For example? ""IOCRY"" not a word? 

Common words? ""IRONY""? but we know S is absent? B is absent? T is absent? but we consider? 

Wait? IRONY? Is IRONY a valid word? 
Letters: I, R, O, N, Y? 
Absent letters: A,E,S,B,T? so N and Y are not absent? 
But have we tested N and Y? No? 

But we know from ORBIT that T is absent? and B is absent? but N and Y are okay? 

Therefore? ""IRONY"" might be a possibility? 

Does it satisfy positions?

In IRONY:
- I at position 1? -> this is the first time we test I at 1? 
- R at position 2? but wait? R was tested at position 2 in ORBIT? and got '-'? meaning R is not at position 2? 
So we cannot put R at position 2? 

Therefore? IRONY has R at 2? which we know is wrong? because ORBIT told us R is not in position 2? 

Therefore? IRONY is invalid? 

We need R to be at 3?4? or 5? 

So? back to pattern I O _ _ _ ?

Then? R cannot be at 2? so the third character? Position 3? 

Then: I O R _ _

Now? the last two positions? must be filled? with letters? not A,E,S,B,T? 

Looking for words that start ""IOR""? 

But are there any? ""IOR"" not common? 

Examples: ""IORTU"" not a word? 

Alternatively? what if we put O elsewhere? 

Other option: put I at position 2? 

Then? Position 2: I? 
Position 1: must be a letter? and it cannot be R (because R not at 1)? cannot be O? because O not at 1? So position 1 has to be a new letter? let's say X? 

Then pattern: X I _ _ _

Then O? can be at 3?4?5? R at 3?4?5? but not position 1 or 2? 

Also? I is at 2? which is new for I? 

But can I be at position 2? We haven't tested position 2 for I? 

So? one such word? ""QUIRK"" has I at 3? which is forbidden? 

How about ""BUILD""? has U and L? D? but B is absent? not allowed? 

Let me think: 

Assign I to position 5? 

Then R must be in 3,4,5? but position 5 is I? so R cannot be at 5? unless duplicate? we avoid? so R in 3 or 4? 

Similarly? O in 2?3?4? (since 5 is I)? 

So? pattern: for instance? _ _ R O I -> but R at 3? O at 4? I at 5? 

This might be possible? 

Letters: ? ? R O I? 

We need two more letters? from available set? 

Example: ""GROIN"" -> but G, R, O, I, N? 
But G? and N? 
Position: 
  R at 2? but we know from ORBIT that R cannot be at 2? 

Wait? the pattern we are considering: position 3: R? position 4: O? position 5: I? 
So we need positions 1 and 2: 

So a word? like X Y R O I? 

Is there any? ""CHORI"" not a word? 

Another idea: Since O is present and not at 1? it could be at 3? and R at 4? I at 1? 

So: Pattern: I ? O ? R? 

Position 1: I? 
Position 3: O? 
Position 5: R? 

Then positions 2 and 4: new letters? 

This might work? 

Example: ""INFOR"" 
I N F O R?
But N, F? O, R? 
But positions: 
1: I? new? 
2: N? new? 
3: O? new? 
4: O? wait? no? 
If ""INFOR"": I-N-F-O-R? 
Then 4: O? 5: R? 
But position 3: F? 
But we put O at 4? 
But wait? we set pattern: I ? O ? R? 
Meaning? position 1: I? position 3: O? position 5: R? 

And position 2 and 4: any? 

In ""INFER"": E? absent? not allowed? because E is absent? 

How about ""INCOR"": 
I, N, C, O, R? 
Positions: 
1: I? 
2: N? 
3: C? -> we want position 3 to be O? but here? C? 
But we planned O at position 3? 

But if we put O at position 3? 
How about ""MORIN""? M O R I N? but then I and N? 
But positions: O at 2? R at 3? I at 4? 
Constraints: 
- O at position 2? allowed? 
- R at position 3: allowed? (previous? R not at 1 or 2? so 3 is fine? 
- I at position 4? but ORBIT feedback: I at 4 got '-'? meaning I is present? but not at position 4? 
Therefore? we cannot put I at position 4? 

So that pattern is invalid? 

Back to: I at position 1? O at position 3? R at position 5? 

Pattern: I ? O ? R? 

Position 2: must be a letter? 
Position 4: must be a letter? 

And the word must be valid? without A,E,S,B,T? 

Example words: 
""MINOR"": M,I,N,O,R? 
But N is available? 
Positions: 
1: M? but we planned I at 1? 
No? 

How about ""DINOR""? not a word? 

Another idea: ""CHOIR"": C,H,O,I,R? 
Positions: 
1: C? 
2: H? 
3: O? 
4: I? 
5: R? 

Check constraints: 
- R at position 5? allowed? 
- I at position 4? but ORBIT feedback: I at 4 got '-'? so I cannot be at 4? 
So invalid? because I cannot be at 4? 

We require I not in 3 or 4? so position 4 is forbidden? 

Therefore? I cannot be in position 4? 

So? in the pattern I?O?R? 
Position 4? if I? it is forbidden? so position 4 must be a new letter? 

Similarly? position 2 must be a new letter? 

Now? position 1? I? 
position 3? O? 
position 5? R? 
position 2: new letter? 
position 4: new letter? 

So word: I X O Y R? 

What words have the pattern I?O?R? 

Examples: ""PILOR"" not a word? 
""VIGOR"": V,I,G,O,R? 
V at 1? I at 2? but we are putting I at 1? 
Wait? we are setting position 1 as I? 

So first letter I? 

Then words: ""IRONV"" invalid? 

Try looking for words that start with ""I"", then any letter? then ""O"", then any letter? then ""R""? 

Such as? ""INQOR""? not a word? 

""INCOR"" is I,N,C,O,R -> places: 
1: I? 
2: N? 
3: C? but we set position 3 to be O? not C? 
Then ""IFORK"" not a word? 

Another thought: ""MORAL"" not? 

Perhaps ""PIORV"" not? 

This may be difficult? 

Perhaps put I at position 2? 

Then: 
Position 1: some letter X? 
Position 2: I? 
Then position? for O?  not 1? 
For R? not 1 or 2? 

Example: X I O ? R? or X I ? O R? etc? 

Lets try to find words that satisfy：

- R in the word at positions: 3,4,5 (and not 1,2)
- I in the word at positions: 1,2,5 (and not 3,4)
- O in the word at positions: 2,3,4,5 (not 1)

And with the two additional letters? which are not in {A,E,S,B,T} 

We try to place I at position 5? 
Then R could be at position 3 or 4? 
O could be at position 2?3?4? 

If O at position 2? then pattern: _ O ? ? I ? but I at 5? 
And R at 3 or 4? 

But I at 5? and O at 2? 

Then positions 1,3,4? 

If R at 3? then pattern: _ O R ? I? 

Example: ""MOR I"" with I at 5? ""MORAI"" not a word? 

""CORDI"": has E? 

Another idea: ""COURI"" not? 

Consider letter C, D, G, U? etc? 

We can use a list? but since I must be at 1,2 or 5? and we've tried 1 and 2 with difficulties? let me try I at 5? 

Then R at 3 or 4? 
And O at 2?3?4? 

Say R at 4? O at 2? then pattern: ? O ? R I? 

Word: ""NORI"" is 4 letters? 

Let me extend: ""LORIC"": L,O,R,I,C? 
But positions: 
1: L? 
2: O? 
3: R? 
4: I?  -> I at position 4? not allowed? 
So not? 

""CONI R"" not? 

""DOILY"" but has D,O,I,L,Y? 
But positions: 
1: D? 
2: O? 
3: I? -> I at 3? not allowed? because I cannot be at 3? 

""DOUR"" is 4? 

What about ""GROIN"": G,R,O,I,N? 
But R at position 2? which is forbidden? 

How about ""PRION"": P,R,I,O,N? 
But R at position 2? forbidden? 

Another idea: ""CRIO? "" words? 

Let me try ""ORCIN"": O at position 1? but we know O not at position 1? 

How about ""UCORI"" not a word? 

Perhaps we should look for words that have the letters and positions? 

Given time? also note that from ORBIT? we have O at position 1 was wrong? but we don't know if O is at other positions? 

Perhaps try a word like ""COLOR"" but has dup O? and not have I? 

We must include I? 

Another possibility: I in position 2? 

Then word pattern: ? I ? ? ? 

And the word should have O and R in allowed positions? 

For instance? ""QUIRK"" has K? and I at 3? not allowed? 

""DOING"" has O? but no R? 

""PILOT"" has T? absent? 

We know T is absent? 

So remove words with T? 

Valid words? 

""GUILD"" has U, I, L, D? no R? 

So need another letter? 

""ORIEL"" has E? not allowed? 

""F R I O ? "" 

Perhaps ""GHOUL"" no I? 
To include R,I,O? 

Let's list common words with R,I,O: 
""RIOJA"" but not English? 
""PRIOR"" has two R? and no O? 

How about ""VIRGO"": 
V,I,R,G,O? 
Positions: 
1: V? 
2: I? 
3: R? -> R can be at 3? (not 1 or 2? so 3 allowed)
4: G? 
5: O? 

Check constraints: 
- I at position 2? allowed? 
- R at position 3: allowed? 
- O at position 5: allowed? 

And: 
- V? not tested? but may be present? 
- G? not tested? may be present? 

Also? avoids A,E,S,B,T? 

Yes? 

Does ""VIRGO"" a word? Yes: a zodiac sign? 

Other words? ""VIRUS"" but has S? absent? 

So ""VIRGO"" might be a good guess? 

Check if it satisfies all feedback: 
- Not using forbidden letters: no A,E,S,B,T? 
- I at position 2: allowed? because not position 3 or 4? and is new? 
- R at position 3: allowed? because not 1 or 2? 
- O at position 5: allowed? not position 1? 

So let's go with ""VIRGO"" for now? 

If this is not the word? we'll get feedback? 

This is our best? 

We output VIRGO? 

Step-by-step reasoning included? 

So guess: VIRGO? 

Then format: <guess>VIRGO</guess> 

To summarize? 

After ORBIT? we know O is present but not at 1? R is present but not at 2? I is present but not at 4? 
And I is not at 3? and there are no A,S,E,B,T? 

VIRGO places:
- I at 2 (new position? the only allowed position test-wise for I? because 1,2,5 are available? but 5 might be taken by O or R? 
- R at 3? which is new for R? 
- O at 5? new for O? 
- V and G haven't been tested? 

If any are missing? we'll know they are absent? 

So it maximizes information? 

Yes.### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Next Guess:

1. **Previous Feedback Analysis**:
   - **Guess 2 (RAISE)**: R and I are present (confirmed by `-`), but R is not in position 1 and I is not in position 3. A, S, and E are absent (`x`).
   - **Guess 3 (ORBIT)**:
     - O is present but not in position 1 (`-`).
     - R is present but not in position 2 (`-`), confirming RAISE's feedback that R cannot be position 1 and now adding position 2 as incorrect.
     - I is present but not in position 4 (`-`), confirming RAISE's feedback that I cannot be position 3 and now adding position 4 as incorrect.
     - B and T are absent (`x`), along with previously excluded A, S, E.

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Present Letters**: R, I, O (must all be included in the next guess).
   - **Absent Letters**: A, E, S, B, T (excluded from all guesses).
   - **Position Constraints**:
     - R: Cannot be in positions 1–2 → must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
     - I: Cannot be in positions 3–4 → must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
     - O: Cannot be in position 1 → must be in positions 2–5.
   - **Unused Letters**: Letters not yet tested are: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Must include R, I, O in positions that satisfy constraints:
     - I and O could compete for position 2, requiring I to be placed in 1 or 5 without conflict.
     - Place R in a new position (3, 4, or 5) since positions 1–2 are invalid.
     - Introduce new common letters to maximize information (e.g., G, V).
   - Avoid positional conflicts:
     - I cannot be at 3 or 4; R cannot be at 1 or 2; O cannot be at 1.
     - Positions 1, 5 are candidates for I if O is elsewhere (e.g., O at 5).

4. **Candidate Word Selection**:
   - Explore words with I at position 2 (untested), R at position 3 (allowed), and O at position 5 (untested).
   - Use new letters (e.g., V, G) to cover more ground.
   - **Chosen Word: ""VIRGO""**:
     - **V**: Untested consonant; common enough to gather feedback.
     - **I**: Position 2 (allowed; contradicts both position 3 and 4 constraints).
     - **R**: Position 3 (allowed; avoids positions 1-2).
     - **G**: Untested consonant; moderate frequency.
     - **O**: Position 5 (allowed; avoids position 1).
   - **Validity**: ""VIRGO"" uses exclusively absent letters and satisfies all known constraints:
     - Confirmed presence of R, I, O.
     - Tests I in a new position (2) and O in a new position (5).
     - Introduces V and G as new probes.
     - Avoids A, E, S, B, T.

5. **Information Gain**:
   - **If VIRGO hits**: Positions for R, I, O are validated.
   - **If not**: Feedback on V/G (absent/present) and positional tweaks for R, I, O will further narrow possibilities.",Guess 4: VIRGO -> FEEDBACK: V(x) I(✓) R(-) G(x) O(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,micro,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that:
- Contains common letters to maximize the chance of getting feedback (hits or misses).
- Covers a variety of letters to gather as much information as possible.

Common starting words in word games often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters and no repeating letters.

Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is also a strong starter, but let me think of a word that includes more common vowels and consonants.

I think ""RAISE"" is a good candidate because:
- It has two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (R, S, I) [note: I is sometimes a vowel but in this case, we can consider it as a consonant for commonality].
- Specifically, R, S, and E are very common.

Another option is ""SLATE"".

But since this is the first guess, any of these would be fine.

I'll go with ""RAISE"". Let's break it down:

R, A, I, S, E: These are all common letters.

After entering ""RAISE"", we will get feedback for each letter: whether it's correct (and in the right place), present but wrong place, or absent.

This feedback will then guide our next guess.

Since this is the first guess, I'll choose ""RAISE"".

Remember the format: the response should be the guessed word between <guess> and </guess> tags.

So, my first guess is: RAISE

<guess>and</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: and -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess again because the previous attempt ""and"" was invalid (not five letters?).
 The user says: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: Guess 1: and -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.""
 This indicates that the previous guess ""and"" was rejected because it wasn't five letters. So we must guess a valid five-letter word.

 Since we are starting over, we should pick a common starting word with five distinct letters to maximize information.

 Popular starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, CRATE, RAISE, etc.

 Let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has common letters and no repeats.

 Alternatively, note that the feedback said: ""Model answer is not five letters"" for ""and"", meaning our previous guess was invalid? 
 But the example in the initial instructions used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", ""BRISK"", so we must guess a valid five-letter word.

 Since the user instructed ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" after invalidating the last one, we'll pick a valid one.

 I'll choose: RAISE

 However, the user's message might be implying that the first guess was ""and"" and it was invalid. So now we are to make the first valid guess.

 Let me re-read: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then they provided feedback on ""and"" being invalid.

 So, we are effectively at the beginning.

 We'll use ""RAISE"".<thinking>
The previous guess ""and"" was invalid because it is not a five-letter word. Since it's the first valid guess, choosing a word with common letters and good coverage of vowels and consonants is strategic for gathering initial feedback. 

Optimal starting words often include:
- Multiple vowels (A, E, I, O) to test common patterns.
- High-frequency consonants (R, S, T, L, N).
- Distinct letters to maximize information per guess.

The word ""RAISE"" fits perfectly:
1. **Five distinct letters** (R, A, I, S, E).
2. Contains **three vowels** (A, I, E) and **two common consonants** (R, S).
3. Covers top-ranked letters used in English (E, A, R, S, I).

This choice will help narrow down possibilities efficiently regardless of the secret word.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: and -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for Guess 2: RAISE -> R(-), A(x), I(-), S(x), E(x)
 This means:
   R is in the secret word but not in the first position (since it's marked with - for wrong position).
   A is not in the word at all.
   I is in the secret word but not in the third position.
   S is not in the word at all.
   E is not in the word at all.

 So, from this feedback, we know:
   The secret word contains R and I, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
   The secret word does not contain A, S, or E.

 We also know that R and I are present, so we must include them in the next guess, but in different positions.

 Now, for the next guess:
   We must choose a valid 5-letter English word that:
     - Does not contain A, S, E (since they are absent).
     - Contains R and I (since they are present).
     - The letter R should not be in position 1 (because in RAISE, R was in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but not in that position).
     - Similarly, the letter I should not be in position 3 (because in RAISE, I was in position 3 and got '-').

 Also, note that we don't know the positions of R and I yet.

 Considering constraints:
   The word must have R and I, and exclude A, S, E.

 Since the secret word has R but not in position 1, and I but not in position 3, we can try to place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 and I in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not position 3).

 We also want to test new letters to gain more information.

 Common letters that haven't been tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to cover as many new letters as possible to maximize information.

 Let's try to think of a word that:
   - Contains R and I (not in their forbidden positions).
   - Uses several other common consonants and vowels (but note: we know E is out, and A is out, so vowels available: O, U, and sometimes Y? But we haven't tested O and U).

 However, note that the secret word might have other vowels.

 Let's aim for a word with R and I and three new letters.

 Since R cannot be first, we can have the pattern:
   Option: R in second position? Or third? Or fourth? Or fifth?

 We also avoid putting I in third.

 Example words:

   If we put R in second position: 
      First letter can be a new letter, then R, then something (but not I in third, so third can be new, then I could be in fourth or fifth).
      Example: ""TROIK"" - not a word.

   Let's try putting R in fourth position and I in second?
      Example: word like ""_ _ I R _"", but then we have to fill the blanks.

   Available letters: We want common letters.

 We know that T, O, L, N are common. 

 Consider ""DRILL"": 
   Length: 5, but contains two L's. 
   R is in position 2 (allowed). I is in position 3? But we must avoid I in position 3? 
   Also, note: I is in position 3, which we must avoid? Because in RAISE, I was in position 3 and got '-', meaning the correct I is not at position 3. 
   So in the next guess, if we put I in position 3, it would be incorrect? Actually, we cannot use I in position 3 again? 
   But wait: the feedback doesn't prevent I from being in position 3, it only told us that the secret word's I is not in position 3. 
   However, could the secret word have two I's? 
   The feedback rules: 
      If a letter is in the word in the wrong position, there might be only one occurrence? Actually, the rules don't specify duplicates. 

 But note the example didn't have duplicates. We must consider duplicates:

   The game rules do not explicitly state how duplicates are handled, but common implementations (like Wordle) do the following:
      Each letter in the guess is matched with the secret word from left to right, and a duplicate letter may only get a '✓' or '-' if there is a matching duplicate in the secret word.

   However, our feedback doesn't specify if the secret word might have duplicates.

   Given the feedback for RAISE: 
        R is present but not in position 1 -> so secret word has at least one R.
        I is present but not in position 3 -> so secret word has at least one I.

   We don't know if they have more than one.

   But we must design our next guess without knowing duplicates.

   It's safer to assume that the secret word might have duplicates? However, we don't have evidence. Also, common words often don't have duplicates.

   So, we'll aim for a word that has R and I only once? That might be better to avoid confusion.

   Therefore, avoid putting R or I in positions that might conflict if we assume single instance.

   Since R cannot be in 1, and I cannot be in 3, we can try to put R in position 2 and I in position 1 (first and second).

   Pattern: I _ R _ _   -> Example: ""IRONY"" -> I at 1 (allowed, because secret's I could be at 1), R at 2 (allowed, because secret's R is not at 1 and we don't know about 2? We only know it's not at 1). But R was at 1 in our previous guess and got '-', meaning secret has R but that R is not at position 1. It could be at position 2? 

   However, we must be cautious: it's possible that the secret word has R at position 2? 

   Actually, the feedback says R is present but not at position 1. It doesn't say where it is.

   Similarly, I is present but not at 3.

   So ""IRONY"" would be:
        I in position 1: possible? But we haven't tested position 1 for I? 
        R in position 2: not forbidden.

   But note: we haven't tested the letter I at position 1? So that's new.

   Let's check if IRONY is a valid word: yes.

   Alternatively, we could put R in position 4 and I in position 2: 
        _ I _ R _ 

   Example: ""FIRED"" -> but E is absent? We cannot use E. So we must avoid E.

   Also, we cannot use S and A.

   So, let's look for words that:
        Contain R and I (exactly once? hoping for no duplicates for now)
        Do not contain A, S, E
        Put R not in position 1 and I not in position 3.

   Examples:
        IRONY: 
          I at 1 (okay), R at 2 (okay), O at 3 (not tested), N at 4 (not tested), Y at 5 (not tested).
          This word uses letters: I, R, O, N, Y.

        Proud: contains O and U -> ""PROUD"" but then I is not in it? So we must have both R and I.

        How about ""THIRD"": 
          T, H, I, R, D -> 
          R is at position 4: okay (not 1)
          I is at position 3: but wait, we must avoid putting I at position 3? Because in RAISE, I at 3 got '-' meaning it's present but not at 3? 
          So if we put I at 3 in this guess, we might get a '-' again? That doesn't tell us anything new? And we use a guess.

          Actually, we hope to avoid repeating known wrong positions? Because if we put I at 3 and get '-' then we already know it's not at 3? So that's redundant.

          Therefore, it's better to put I in a new position: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

        Similarly, R must not be at position 1? It can be at 2,3,4,5? But we also haven't tested R in other positions.

        So in ""THIRD"": 
          I is at 3 -> forbidden? Because feedback says I cannot be at 3? 
          Actually, the secret word doesn't have I at position 3? So if we put I at 3, we know for sure that it will be marked '-' (unless the secret has two I's and one is at 3? But we don't know that).

        Without knowing duplicates, to avoid ambiguity, we avoid putting I in position 3? Same for R in position 1.

        Hence, we should avoid position 3 for I and position 1 for R.

   So, back to examples:

      Option 1: IRONY (I in 1, R in 2) -> both positions are new for these letters? 
          But note: R was in position 1 last time? Now we put R in position 2: that's a new position.

      Option 2: a word with R in position 5 and I in position 2? Like ""GUILD"" but G,U,I,L,D -> but it has L... but we need R? Actually, ""GUILD"" doesn't contain R.

   Another example: ""ROBIN"" -> 
         R at position 1: forbidden? Because R was in position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but not at 1? 
         So R at position 1 is bad? Then ROBIN is invalid.

   How about ""ORBIT"": 
         O _ _ _ _ -> wait, first letter O, then R? 
         Positions: O, R, B, I, T -> so R at 2, I at 4. 
         This satisfies: R not at 1 (it's at 2), I not at 3 (it's at 4). 
         Also, contains O, R, B, I, T -> letters not in {A, S, E}? Yes.

   ORBIT is a valid word? Yes.

   Another candidate: ""DIRTY"": 
         D, I, R, T, Y -> 
         D at 1, I at 2 (okay, because avoiding I at 3), R at 3 (okay? we didn't test R at 3? yes, because we only know about R at 1) -> allowed? 
         Yes: R was tested in position 1 and failed? So position 3 is new? 
         But note: R might be in position 3? 
         Also, we have I in position 2: which is a new position.

   But ORBIT and DIRTY and IRONY are all valid.

   Which one maximizes new information?

   IRONY: letters I, R (which are known), and O, N, Y (new).
   ORBIT: O, R, B, I, T -> letters: O, R, B, I, T -> known: R, I; new: O, B, T.
   DIRTY: D, I, R, T, Y -> known: R, I; new: D, T, Y.

   We haven't tested: O, B, T, D, Y, N.

   T is a very common letter? So including T might be good? 

   Also, note: the secret word doesn't have A, E, S -> so likely has T or O or other vowels? 

   Let's rank common letters: T, O, L, N, C, etc.

   IRONY: O and N are common? Also Y is less common.
   ORBIT: O and T are common? and B is less common? 
   DIRTY: T and D? and Y.

   ORBIT covers two common letters (O and T) and one less common (B). 

   But note: we only have 6 guesses, so we want to cover more common letters? 

   Alternatively, we can look for a word that includes T and O? Like ORTIC? not a word.

   Another word: ""POINT"" -> but does not contain R? We are forced to include R and I? Because they are known present? 

   Without R and I, we'd be ignoring known presence? So we must include both.

   Therefore, ORBIT (with O, R, B, I, T) seems to cover T and O? And B? 

   Alternatively, ""TROOP"" -> duplicate O and R? We avoid duplicates? and also R must not in position 1? TROOP has R at 1? -> invalid because R at 1 is disallowed for this guess? 

   Also, it doesn't have I? 

   How about ""TOUCH"" -> no R or I.

   Therefore, from the candidates:

      ORBIT: 
          Position 1: O (new)
          Position 2: R (we don't know about position 2 but R was only tested in 1? so this is new for R? So we might get ✓ or - for R? We hope for ✓)
          Position 3: B (new)
          Position 4: I (I was tested only in position 3? so testing I in 4? that's new? so we might get ✓ or - for I? We hope for ✓)
          Position 5: T (new)

      This seems good? 

      DIRTY: 
          Position 1: D (new)
          Position 2: I (new for I? because I was tested in 3? So testing I in 2? okay)
          Position 3: R (new for R? because R was tested in 1? So okay)
          Position 4: T (new)
          Position 5: Y (new)

      This also seems good? 

   ORBIT might be better because it includes the common letter T? But DIRTY has T too? and also D and Y? 

   Actually, both have T? 

   ORBIT: common letters O and T? DIRTY: common letters T and D? Let me check commonness:
      According to English letter frequency: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, ...

      But since A, E are absent, T and O are more common? 

   Also, ORBIT introduces three consonants and one vowel? secret word might have O.

   However, note feedback: RAISE had I which we know is present? but we don't know about vowels? because the secret word doesn't have E or A? so O or U might be present? 

   Since ORBIT includes O? if O is present? then also B and T? 

   We are looking for maximum information? 

   How about ""POINT"" -> doesn't have R? invalid? Because we must include R? 

   Another word: ""TRIPY""? not a word.

   Let me check ""RIGHT"": 
        R at 1 -> forbidden? But we can't put R at 1? not allowed? 
        So ""WRING"": 
           W at 1? then R at 2? I at 3? Forbidden: I cannot be at 3? 
        So we must avoid I at 3.

   So ""WRING"" is invalid? Because I at 3? 

   How about ""FRUIT"": 
        F, R, U, I, T -> 
        R at position 2? Okay? 
        I at position 4? Okay? 
        Contains U? Haven't tested U? 
        But has F and T? 
        Also, it uses U? 

        And it doesn't contain forbidden letters: A, S, E? 

        Yes: ""FRUIT"" is a word? Yes.

   Now compare FRUIT, ORBIT, DIRTY, IRONY.

   FRUIT: F, R, U, I, T -> new: F, U, T? known: R, I? 
   DIRTY: D, I, R, T, Y -> known: R, I; new: D, T, Y? 
   ORBIT: O, R, B, I, T -> known: R, I; new: O, B, T? 
   IRONY: I, R, O, N, Y -> known: R, I; new: O, N, Y? 

   Which one gives most information? 

   We want to test letters that are common? 

   Common consonants: T is very common? So T appears in FRUIT, ORBIT, and DIRTY? 
   FRUIT also tests U which is a vowel? and F which is common? 

   Actually, T is in the top 3? O in the top 5? 

   Therefore, ORBIT tests O (high) and T (high) and B (less common)? 
   FRUIT tests U (vowel? common) and T (high) and F (common)? 
   DIRTY tests D (common? above average), T and Y (less common)? 

   Let me see:

      FRUIT: F is the 6th most common consonant? T is 2nd? U is vowel? 
      But U is the 7th most common letter? 

      ORBIT: O is the 4th? T is 2nd? B is not that common? 

      So FRUIT might be better because it has U? which is a vowel? 

   However, we cannot say? 

   Another candidate: ""BUILT"" -> has U and I? but I? R is missing? 

   We must include R? 

   How about ""FLIRT"": 
        F, L, I, R, T -> 
        Positions: R at 4? I at 3? Wait? I at position 3? forbidden? 

   Because we cannot put I at position 3? so avoid? 

   How about ""TRYST""? Has duplicate T? and Y? but no I? 

   We must include I? 

   Final decision: 

   Given that we know the secret word has R and I? and excludes A, E, S? and we have no idea about duplicates? 

   We choose a word that uses R and I in new positions? and includes three new common letters? 

   ORBIT: 
        Position 1: O -> if O is present, might help? 
        Position 2: R -> because R was tested only in 1? we try position 2? might be correct? or wrong? 
        Position 4: I -> move? testing position 4? 
        Position 5: T -> common? 

   DIRTY: 
        Position 1: D -> might be common? 
        Position 2: I -> since I was at 3? we test position 2? 
        Position 3: R -> testing position 3 for R? 
        Position 4: T -> common? 

   Another one: ""OUTER"" -> contains E? forbidden? 

   How about ""QUIRK""? 
        Q, U, I, R, K -> 
        Positions: I at position 3? forbidden? 
        Not allowed? 

   Let me think of words that put I at 1, R at 5? 
        Example: ""INTRO"" -> 
             I at 1? R at 5? 
             But the word has N,T,R,O? and I? 
             I at 1: not tested before? 
             R at 5: new position? 
             But also has N, T, R, O? 
        The word ""INTRO"" is valid? 

        INTRO: I at position 1 (okay), N at 2, T at 3, R at 4 (wait? R at 4? because spelling: I-N-T-R-O? So positions:
          1: I
          2: N
          3: T
          4: R
          5: O

        I at 1: allowed? because we only know I is not at 3? 
        R at 4: allowed? because R not at 1? and 4 is new? 

        So ""INTRO"" is a candidate: I, N, T, R, O? 
        Letters: I, N, T, R, O? 
        Known: I and R? 
        New: N, T, O? 

   So INTRO: new common letters O, T? and N? 

   ORBIT, INTRO, IRONY are similar? 

   We need to choose one? 

   Let's pick ORBIT? Because it uses R at position 2 and I at position 4? which are two new positions? and INTRO has I at 1? which is also new? 

   ORBIT has T at the end? which might be important.

   Alternatively, we can pick ""POINT"" -> wait, no R? We must include R? 

   Final choice? ORBIT: because it uses two common letters O and T? and the word is common? 

   But another? How about ""BIRTH"":
        B, I, R, T, H -> 
        I at position 2: okay? 
        R at position 3: okay? 
        But note: the word has BIRTH -> I at 2, R at 3? 
        Also, no forbidden positions? 
        The letter B? 

   We'll go with ORBIT? 

   However, note: ORBIT has too many common letters? 

   But I think ORBIT is fine.

   So I guess: ORBIT

   Let's write it: O-R-B-I-T.

   Reminder of constraints:
        R is present -> in ORBIT, we put R at position 2? 
        I is present -> put at position 4? 
        Avoid position 1 for R? Avoid position 3 for I? satisfied.

   Also, doesn't use A, S, E? 

   Yes? ORBIT: letters O, R, B, I, T -> none of A, S, E.

   So ORBIT is a valid word.

   We output: <guess>ORBIT</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`)
- A is not in the secret word (marked with `x`)
- I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked with `-`)
- S and E are not in the secret word (marked with `x`)

Key deductions:
1. The secret word **contains R and I** (at least one each).
2. The secret word **excludes A, S, and E**.
3. R cannot be in position 1, and I cannot be in position 3.

For the next guess:
- Must include R and I, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.
- Must exclude A, S, E.
- Tests new positions for R and I while covering frequent letters (like O, T) to maximize information.

""ORBIT"" fits these requirements:
- R is in position 2 (avoiding position 1).
- I is in position 4 (avoiding position 3).
- Introduces three new letters: O (common vowel), B, and T (common consonant).

This choice strategically probes R/I placements and common untested letters.

<guess>ORBIT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: and -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 3: ORBIT -> FEEDBACK: O(-) R(-) B(x) I(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback for Guess 3: ORBIT -> O(-) R(-) B(x) I(-) T(x)

This means:
- O is in the secret word but not in position 1 (because in ORBIT, O was at position 1).
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (since it got '-' and was at position 2).
- B is not in the word at all.
- I is in the secret word but not in position 4 (since it was at position 4 and marked '-').
- T is not in the word at all.

Combining with prior feedback:
From Guess 2 (RAISE):
- R is present → confirmed, and we now know it can't be in positions 1 or 2.
- I is present → confirmed, and we know it can't be in positions 3 or 4.
- A, S, E, B, T are absent.

Current knowledge:
- Present letters: R, I, O (from this guess we learned O is present)
- Absent letters: A, E, S, B, T
- Position constraints:
  - R: not in pos 1 or 2 → so must be in pos 3, 4, or 5.
  - I: not in pos 3 or 4 → so must be in pos 1, 2, or 5.
  - O: not in pos 1 → so must be in pos 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We must form a valid 5-letter word containing R, I, O, excluding the absent letters.

Available letters: exclude A, E, S, B, T. 
Common letters left: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Additionally, we need to assign R, I, O to positions that satisfy the constraints.

Possible approach: 
- Since R must be in 3,4,5 and I in 1,2,5, and O in 2,3,4,5, we need to find a combination where these don't conflict.

Consider positions:
- Position 1: must be one of the available letters (not R? because R can't be in 1? But wait, from ORBIT we learned R is not in 2? and from RAISE we learned R is not in 1, but now we know O is present and not in 1. Also, I can be in 1? 
  Actually, we haven't tested I in position 1? So position 1 could be I or any other new letter that is present? but we don't know what is present besides R,I,O? we don't know? So position 1 must be I or a new letter that we haven't tested? But it must be a letter in the word? We only know R,I,O are present? but there might be other letters? Indeed, the word has 5 letters? so there are two more? That we haven't found? Or duplicates?

But we don't know duplicates? We assume possibly one of each? 

Therefore, the word must contain R, I, O, and two more letters that must be from the available set? excluding absent letters? 

The two extra letters must be chosen from: C,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We want to pick a word that satisfies positional constraints? 

Now, let's list possibilities:

R positions: 3,4,5
I positions: 1,2,5
O positions: 2,3,4,5

But we have 5 positions? So we must assign these 3 letters to three of the five positions? along with two other letters.

We also have constraints from the feedback? 

Moreover, we must make sure: I cannot be in 3 or 4? R cannot be in 1 or 2? O cannot be in 1? 

Option: Assign I to position 1? 
Then, position 1: I
Then, O can be in 2?3?4?5? R can be in 3?4?5? 

But if we put I at position 1, then position 1 is fixed? 

Then, for position 2: cannot be R? and cannot be O? if O is at 2? but wait? O can be anywhere? except 1? so position 2 can be O? 

But also? position 2 can be a new letter? 

We need to include O? So O must be in one of the positions? 

Similarly for R? 

But if position 1 is I? then:

Position 2: cannot be R? because R can't be at 2? So position 2 can be O? or a new letter? 

If position 2 is O? this matches? O's constraint? and it's not position 1? 

But then R must be at 3,4, or 5? 

Also, position 2: O? then that would satisfy O? but then we have positions 3,4,5 for R and the two new letters? 

But we must place R? 

But note: I is at position 1? so okay? 

So positions:
1: I
2: O? Then R must be at 3,4, or 5? 

But what about the two remaining positions? 

Also, note: the previously found constraints? 

Also, we still don't know if there are duplicates? 

But if we put O at 2? then we have O at position 2? which hasn't been tested? because in ORBIT? O was at 1? 

So O can be at 2? 

Similarly, I at 1? we haven't tested I at position 1? only at position 3? 

So that is possible? 

Then? a word pattern: I O _ _ _

But then R must be at one of the last three? 

And the other two positions? new letters? 

We'd form words? like IO??? 

For example? ""IOCRY"" not a word? 

Common words? ""IRONY""? but we know S is absent? B is absent? T is absent? but we consider? 

Wait? IRONY? Is IRONY a valid word? 
Letters: I, R, O, N, Y? 
Absent letters: A,E,S,B,T? so N and Y are not absent? 
But have we tested N and Y? No? 

But we know from ORBIT that T is absent? and B is absent? but N and Y are okay? 

Therefore? ""IRONY"" might be a possibility? 

Does it satisfy positions?

In IRONY:
- I at position 1? -> this is the first time we test I at 1? 
- R at position 2? but wait? R was tested at position 2 in ORBIT? and got '-'? meaning R is not at position 2? 
So we cannot put R at position 2? 

Therefore? IRONY has R at 2? which we know is wrong? because ORBIT told us R is not in position 2? 

Therefore? IRONY is invalid? 

We need R to be at 3?4? or 5? 

So? back to pattern I O _ _ _ ?

Then? R cannot be at 2? so the third character? Position 3? 

Then: I O R _ _

Now? the last two positions? must be filled? with letters? not A,E,S,B,T? 

Looking for words that start ""IOR""? 

But are there any? ""IOR"" not common? 

Examples: ""IORTU"" not a word? 

Alternatively? what if we put O elsewhere? 

Other option: put I at position 2? 

Then? Position 2: I? 
Position 1: must be a letter? and it cannot be R (because R not at 1)? cannot be O? because O not at 1? So position 1 has to be a new letter? let's say X? 

Then pattern: X I _ _ _

Then O? can be at 3?4?5? R at 3?4?5? but not position 1 or 2? 

Also? I is at 2? which is new for I? 

But can I be at position 2? We haven't tested position 2 for I? 

So? one such word? ""QUIRK"" has I at 3? which is forbidden? 

How about ""BUILD""? has U and L? D? but B is absent? not allowed? 

Let me think: 

Assign I to position 5? 

Then R must be in 3,4,5? but position 5 is I? so R cannot be at 5? unless duplicate? we avoid? so R in 3 or 4? 

Similarly? O in 2?3?4? (since 5 is I)? 

So? pattern: for instance? _ _ R O I -> but R at 3? O at 4? I at 5? 

This might be possible? 

Letters: ? ? R O I? 

We need two more letters? from available set? 

Example: ""GROIN"" -> but G, R, O, I, N? 
But G? and N? 
Position: 
  R at 2? but we know from ORBIT that R cannot be at 2? 

Wait? the pattern we are considering: position 3: R? position 4: O? position 5: I? 
So we need positions 1 and 2: 

So a word? like X Y R O I? 

Is there any? ""CHORI"" not a word? 

Another idea: Since O is present and not at 1? it could be at 3? and R at 4? I at 1? 

So: Pattern: I ? O ? R? 

Position 1: I? 
Position 3: O? 
Position 5: R? 

Then positions 2 and 4: new letters? 

This might work? 

Example: ""INFOR"" 
I N F O R?
But N, F? O, R? 
But positions: 
1: I? new? 
2: N? new? 
3: O? new? 
4: O? wait? no? 
If ""INFOR"": I-N-F-O-R? 
Then 4: O? 5: R? 
But position 3: F? 
But we put O at 4? 
But wait? we set pattern: I ? O ? R? 
Meaning? position 1: I? position 3: O? position 5: R? 

And position 2 and 4: any? 

In ""INFER"": E? absent? not allowed? because E is absent? 

How about ""INCOR"": 
I, N, C, O, R? 
Positions: 
1: I? 
2: N? 
3: C? -> we want position 3 to be O? but here? C? 
But we planned O at position 3? 

But if we put O at position 3? 
How about ""MORIN""? M O R I N? but then I and N? 
But positions: O at 2? R at 3? I at 4? 
Constraints: 
- O at position 2? allowed? 
- R at position 3: allowed? (previous? R not at 1 or 2? so 3 is fine? 
- I at position 4? but ORBIT feedback: I at 4 got '-'? meaning I is present? but not at position 4? 
Therefore? we cannot put I at position 4? 

So that pattern is invalid? 

Back to: I at position 1? O at position 3? R at position 5? 

Pattern: I ? O ? R? 

Position 2: must be a letter? 
Position 4: must be a letter? 

And the word must be valid? without A,E,S,B,T? 

Example words: 
""MINOR"": M,I,N,O,R? 
But N is available? 
Positions: 
1: M? but we planned I at 1? 
No? 

How about ""DINOR""? not a word? 

Another idea: ""CHOIR"": C,H,O,I,R? 
Positions: 
1: C? 
2: H? 
3: O? 
4: I? 
5: R? 

Check constraints: 
- R at position 5? allowed? 
- I at position 4? but ORBIT feedback: I at 4 got '-'? so I cannot be at 4? 
So invalid? because I cannot be at 4? 

We require I not in 3 or 4? so position 4 is forbidden? 

Therefore? I cannot be in position 4? 

So? in the pattern I?O?R? 
Position 4? if I? it is forbidden? so position 4 must be a new letter? 

Similarly? position 2 must be a new letter? 

Now? position 1? I? 
position 3? O? 
position 5? R? 
position 2: new letter? 
position 4: new letter? 

So word: I X O Y R? 

What words have the pattern I?O?R? 

Examples: ""PILOR"" not a word? 
""VIGOR"": V,I,G,O,R? 
V at 1? I at 2? but we are putting I at 1? 
Wait? we are setting position 1 as I? 

So first letter I? 

Then words: ""IRONV"" invalid? 

Try looking for words that start with ""I"", then any letter? then ""O"", then any letter? then ""R""? 

Such as? ""INQOR""? not a word? 

""INCOR"" is I,N,C,O,R -> places: 
1: I? 
2: N? 
3: C? but we set position 3 to be O? not C? 
Then ""IFORK"" not a word? 

Another thought: ""MORAL"" not? 

Perhaps ""PIORV"" not? 

This may be difficult? 

Perhaps put I at position 2? 

Then: 
Position 1: some letter X? 
Position 2: I? 
Then position? for O?  not 1? 
For R? not 1 or 2? 

Example: X I O ? R? or X I ? O R? etc? 

Lets try to find words that satisfy：

- R in the word at positions: 3,4,5 (and not 1,2)
- I in the word at positions: 1,2,5 (and not 3,4)
- O in the word at positions: 2,3,4,5 (not 1)

And with the two additional letters? which are not in {A,E,S,B,T} 

We try to place I at position 5? 
Then R could be at position 3 or 4? 
O could be at position 2?3?4? 

If O at position 2? then pattern: _ O ? ? I ? but I at 5? 
And R at 3 or 4? 

But I at 5? and O at 2? 

Then positions 1,3,4? 

If R at 3? then pattern: _ O R ? I? 

Example: ""MOR I"" with I at 5? ""MORAI"" not a word? 

""CORDI"": has E? 

Another idea: ""COURI"" not? 

Consider letter C, D, G, U? etc? 

We can use a list? but since I must be at 1,2 or 5? and we've tried 1 and 2 with difficulties? let me try I at 5? 

Then R at 3 or 4? 
And O at 2?3?4? 

Say R at 4? O at 2? then pattern: ? O ? R I? 

Word: ""NORI"" is 4 letters? 

Let me extend: ""LORIC"": L,O,R,I,C? 
But positions: 
1: L? 
2: O? 
3: R? 
4: I?  -> I at position 4? not allowed? 
So not? 

""CONI R"" not? 

""DOILY"" but has D,O,I,L,Y? 
But positions: 
1: D? 
2: O? 
3: I? -> I at 3? not allowed? because I cannot be at 3? 

""DOUR"" is 4? 

What about ""GROIN"": G,R,O,I,N? 
But R at position 2? which is forbidden? 

How about ""PRION"": P,R,I,O,N? 
But R at position 2? forbidden? 

Another idea: ""CRIO? "" words? 

Let me try ""ORCIN"": O at position 1? but we know O not at position 1? 

How about ""UCORI"" not a word? 

Perhaps we should look for words that have the letters and positions? 

Given time? also note that from ORBIT? we have O at position 1 was wrong? but we don't know if O is at other positions? 

Perhaps try a word like ""COLOR"" but has dup O? and not have I? 

We must include I? 

Another possibility: I in position 2? 

Then word pattern: ? I ? ? ? 

And the word should have O and R in allowed positions? 

For instance? ""QUIRK"" has K? and I at 3? not allowed? 

""DOING"" has O? but no R? 

""PILOT"" has T? absent? 

We know T is absent? 

So remove words with T? 

Valid words? 

""GUILD"" has U, I, L, D? no R? 

So need another letter? 

""ORIEL"" has E? not allowed? 

""F R I O ? "" 

Perhaps ""GHOUL"" no I? 
To include R,I,O? 

Let's list common words with R,I,O: 
""RIOJA"" but not English? 
""PRIOR"" has two R? and no O? 

How about ""VIRGO"": 
V,I,R,G,O? 
Positions: 
1: V? 
2: I? 
3: R? -> R can be at 3? (not 1 or 2? so 3 allowed)
4: G? 
5: O? 

Check constraints: 
- I at position 2? allowed? 
- R at position 3: allowed? 
- O at position 5: allowed? 

And: 
- V? not tested? but may be present? 
- G? not tested? may be present? 

Also? avoids A,E,S,B,T? 

Yes? 

Does ""VIRGO"" a word? Yes: a zodiac sign? 

Other words? ""VIRUS"" but has S? absent? 

So ""VIRGO"" might be a good guess? 

Check if it satisfies all feedback: 
- Not using forbidden letters: no A,E,S,B,T? 
- I at position 2: allowed? because not position 3 or 4? and is new? 
- R at position 3: allowed? because not 1 or 2? 
- O at position 5: allowed? not position 1? 

So let's go with ""VIRGO"" for now? 

If this is not the word? we'll get feedback? 

This is our best? 

We output VIRGO? 

Step-by-step reasoning included? 

So guess: VIRGO? 

Then format: <guess>VIRGO</guess> 

To summarize? 

After ORBIT? we know O is present but not at 1? R is present but not at 2? I is present but not at 4? 
And I is not at 3? and there are no A,S,E,B,T? 

VIRGO places:
- I at 2 (new position? the only allowed position test-wise for I? because 1,2,5 are available? but 5 might be taken by O or R? 
- R at 3? which is new for R? 
- O at 5? new for O? 
- V and G haven't been tested? 

If any are missing? we'll know they are absent? 

So it maximizes information? 

Yes.### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Next Guess:

1. **Previous Feedback Analysis**:
   - **Guess 2 (RAISE)**: R and I are present (confirmed by `-`), but R is not in position 1 and I is not in position 3. A, S, and E are absent (`x`).
   - **Guess 3 (ORBIT)**:
     - O is present but not in position 1 (`-`).
     - R is present but not in position 2 (`-`), confirming RAISE's feedback that R cannot be position 1 and now adding position 2 as incorrect.
     - I is present but not in position 4 (`-`), confirming RAISE's feedback that I cannot be position 3 and now adding position 4 as incorrect.
     - B and T are absent (`x`), along with previously excluded A, S, E.

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Present Letters**: R, I, O (must all be included in the next guess).
   - **Absent Letters**: A, E, S, B, T (excluded from all guesses).
   - **Position Constraints**:
     - R: Cannot be in positions 1–2 → must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
     - I: Cannot be in positions 3–4 → must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
     - O: Cannot be in position 1 → must be in positions 2–5.
   - **Unused Letters**: Letters not yet tested are: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Must include R, I, O in positions that satisfy constraints:
     - I and O could compete for position 2, requiring I to be placed in 1 or 5 without conflict.
     - Place R in a new position (3, 4, or 5) since positions 1–2 are invalid.
     - Introduce new common letters to maximize information (e.g., G, V).
   - Avoid positional conflicts:
     - I cannot be at 3 or 4; R cannot be at 1 or 2; O cannot be at 1.
     - Positions 1, 5 are candidates for I if O is elsewhere (e.g., O at 5).

4. **Candidate Word Selection**:
   - Explore words with I at position 2 (untested), R at position 3 (allowed), and O at position 5 (untested).
   - Use new letters (e.g., V, G) to cover more ground.
   - **Chosen Word: ""VIRGO""**:
     - **V**: Untested consonant; common enough to gather feedback.
     - **I**: Position 2 (allowed; contradicts both position 3 and 4 constraints).
     - **R**: Position 3 (allowed; avoids positions 1-2).
     - **G**: Untested consonant; moderate frequency.
     - **O**: Position 5 (allowed; avoids position 1).
   - **Validity**: ""VIRGO"" uses exclusively absent letters and satisfies all known constraints:
     - Confirmed presence of R, I, O.
     - Tests I in a new position (2) and O in a new position (5).
     - Introduces V and G as new probes.
     - Avoids A, E, S, B, T.

5. **Information Gain**:
   - **If VIRGO hits**: Positions for R, I, O are validated.
   - **If not**: Feedback on V/G (absent/present) and positional tweaks for R, I, O will further narrow possibilities.

So now we are to make the first valid guess.\n\n Let me re-read: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess."" and then they provided feedback on ""and"" being invalid.\n\n So, we are effectively at the beginning.\n\n We\'ll use ""RAISE"".<thinking>\nThe previous guess ""and"" was invalid because it is not a five-letter word. Since it\'s the first valid guess, choosing a word with common letters and good coverage of vowels and consonants is strategic for gathering initial feedback. \n\nOptimal starting words often include:\n- Multiple vowels (A, E, I, O) to test common patterns.\n- High-frequency consonants (R, S, T, L, N).\n- Distinct letters to maximize information per guess.\n\nThe word ""RAISE"" fits perfectly:\n1. **Five distinct letters** (R, A, I, S, E).\n2. Contains **three vowels** (A, I, E) and **two common consonants** (R, S).\n3. Covers top-ranked letters used in English (E, A, R, S, I).\n\nThis choice will help narrow down possibilities efficiently regardless of the secret word.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: and -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\nGuess 2: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for Guess 2: RAISE -> R(-), A(x), I(-), S(x), E(x)\n This means:\n   R is in the secret word but not in the first position (since it\'s marked with - for wrong position).\n   A is not in the word at all.\n   I is in the secret word but not in the third position.\n   S is not in the word at all.\n   E is not in the word at all.\n\n So, from this feedback, we know:\n   The secret word contains R and I, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.\n   The secret word does not contain A, S, or E.\n\n We also know that R and I are present, so we must include them in the next guess, but in different positions.\n\n Now, for the next guess:\n   We must choose a valid 5-letter English word that:\n     - Does not contain A, S, E (since they are absent).\n     - Contains R and I (since they are present).\n     - The letter R should not be in position 1 (because in RAISE, R was in position 1 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not in that position).\n     - Similarly, the letter I should not be in position 3 (because in RAISE, I was in position 3 and got \'-\').\n\n Also, note that we don\'t know the positions of R and I yet.\n\n Considering constraints:\n   The word must have R and I, and exclude A, S, E.\n\n Since the secret word has R but not in position 1, and I but not in position 3, we can try to place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 and I in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not position 3).\n\n We also want to test new letters to gain more information.\n\n Common letters that haven\'t been tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We want to cover as many new letters as possible to maximize information.\n\n Let\'s try to think of a word that:\n   - Contains R and I (not in their forbidden positions).\n   - Uses several other common consonants and vowels (but note: we know E is out, and A is out, so vowels available: O, U, and sometimes Y? But we haven\'t tested O and U).\n\n However, note that the secret word might have other vowels.\n\n Let\'s aim for a word with R and I and three new letters.\n\n Since R cannot be first, we can have the pattern:\n   Option: R in second position? Or third? Or fourth? Or fifth?\n\n We also avoid putting I in third.\n\n Example words:\n\n   If we put R in second position: \n      First letter can be a new letter, then R, then something (but not I in third, so third can be new, then I could be in fourth or fifth).\n      Example: ""TROIK"" - not a word.\n\n   Let\'s try putting R in fourth position and I in second?\n      Example: word like ""_ _ I R _"", but then we have to fill the blanks.\n\n   Available letters: We want common letters.\n\n We know that T, O, L, N are common. \n\n Consider ""DRILL"": \n   Length: 5, but contains two L\'s. \n   R is in position 2 (allowed). I is in position 3? But we must avoid I in position 3? \n   Also, note: I is in position 3, which we must avoid? Because in RAISE, I was in position 3 and got \'-\', meaning the correct I is not at position 3. \n   So in the next guess, if we put I in position 3, it would be incorrect? Actually, we cannot use I in position 3 again? \n   But wait: the feedback doesn\'t prevent I from being in position 3, it only told us that the secret word\'s I is not in position 3. \n   However, could the secret word have two I\'s? \n   The feedback rules: \n      If a letter is in the word in the wrong position, there might be only one occurrence? Actually, the rules don\'t specify duplicates. \n\n But note the example didn\'t have duplicates. We must consider duplicates:\n\n   The game rules do not explicitly state how duplicates are handled, but common implementations (like Wordle) do the following:\n      Each letter in the guess is matched with the secret word from left to right, and a duplicate letter may only get a \'✓\' or \'-\' if there is a matching duplicate in the secret word.\n\n   However, our feedback doesn\'t specify if the secret word might have duplicates.\n\n   Given the feedback for RAISE: \n        R is present but not in position 1 -> so secret word has at least one R.\n        I is present but not in position 3 -> so secret word has at least one I.\n\n   We don\'t know if they have more than one.\n\n   But we must design our next guess without knowing duplicates.\n\n   It\'s safer to assume that the secret word might have duplicates? However, we don\'t have evidence. Also, common words often don\'t have duplicates.\n\n   So, we\'ll aim for a word that has R and I only once? That might be better to avoid confusion.\n\n   Therefore, avoid putting R or I in positions that might conflict if we assume single instance.\n\n   Since R cannot be in 1, and I cannot be in 3, we can try to put R in position 2 and I in position 1 (first and second).\n\n   Pattern: I _ R _ _   -> Example: ""IRONY"" -> I at 1 (allowed, because secret\'s I could be at 1), R at 2 (allowed, because secret\'s R is not at 1 and we don\'t know about 2? We only know it\'s not at 1). But R was at 1 in our previous guess and got \'-\', meaning secret has R but that R is not at position 1. It could be at position 2? \n\n   However, we must be cautious: it\'s possible that the secret word has R at position 2? \n\n   Actually, the feedback says R is present but not at position 1. It doesn\'t say where it is.\n\n   Similarly, I is present but not at 3.\n\n   So ""IRONY"" would be:\n        I in position 1: possible? But we haven\'t tested position 1 for I? \n        R in position 2: not forbidden.\n\n   But note: we haven\'t tested the letter I at position 1? So that\'s new.\n\n   Let\'s check if IRONY is a valid word: yes.\n\n   Alternatively, we could put R in position 4 and I in position 2: \n        _ I _ R _ \n\n   Example: ""FIRED"" -> but E is absent? We cannot use E. So we must avoid E.\n\n   Also, we cannot use S and A.\n\n   So, let\'s look for words that:\n        Contain R and I (exactly once? hoping for no duplicates for now)\n        Do not contain A, S, E\n        Put R not in position 1 and I not in position 3.\n\n   Examples:\n        IRONY: \n          I at 1 (okay), R at 2 (okay), O at 3 (not tested), N at 4 (not tested), Y at 5 (not tested).\n          This word uses letters: I, R, O, N, Y.\n\n        Proud: contains O and U -> ""PROUD"" but then I is not in it? So we must have both R and I.\n\n        How about ""THIRD"": \n          T, H, I, R, D -> \n          R is at position 4: okay (not 1)\n          I is at position 3: but wait, we must avoid putting I at position 3? Because in RAISE, I at 3 got \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not at 3? \n          So if we put I at 3 in this guess, we might get a \'-\' again? That doesn\'t tell us anything new? And we use a guess.\n\n          Actually, we hope to avoid repeating known wrong positions? Because if we put I at 3 and get \'-\' then we already know it\'s not at 3? So that\'s redundant.\n\n          Therefore, it\'s better to put I in a new position: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n        Similarly, R must not be at position 1? It can be at 2,3,4,5? But we also haven\'t tested R in other positions.\n\n        So in ""THIRD"": \n          I is at 3 -> forbidden? Because feedback says I cannot be at 3? \n          Actually, the secret word doesn\'t have I at position 3? So if we put I at 3, we know for sure that it will be marked \'-\' (unless the secret has two I\'s and one is at 3? But we don\'t know that).\n\n        Without knowing duplicates, to avoid ambiguity, we avoid putting I in position 3? Same for R in position 1.\n\n        Hence, we should avoid position 3 for I and position 1 for R.\n\n   So, back to examples:\n\n      Option 1: IRONY (I in 1, R in 2) -> both positions are new for these letters? \n          But note: R was in position 1 last time? Now we put R in position 2: that\'s a new position.\n\n      Option 2: a word with R in position 5 and I in position 2? Like ""GUILD"" but G,U,I,L,D -> but it has L... but we need R? Actually, ""GUILD"" doesn\'t contain R.\n\n   Another example: ""ROBIN"" -> \n         R at position 1: forbidden? Because R was in position 1 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not at 1? \n         So R at position 1 is bad? Then ROBIN is invalid.\n\n   How about ""ORBIT"": \n         O _ _ _ _ -> wait, first letter O, then R? \n         Positions: O, R, B, I, T -> so R at 2, I at 4. \n         This satisfies: R not at 1 (it\'s at 2), I not at 3 (it\'s at 4). \n         Also, contains O, R, B, I, T -> letters not in {A, S, E}? Yes.\n\n   ORBIT is a valid word? Yes.\n\n   Another candidate: ""DIRTY"": \n         D, I, R, T, Y -> \n         D at 1, I at 2 (okay, because avoiding I at 3), R at 3 (okay? we didn\'t test R at 3? yes, because we only know about R at 1) -> allowed? \n         Yes: R was tested in position 1 and failed? So position 3 is new? \n         But note: R might be in position 3? \n         Also, we have I in position 2: which is a new position.\n\n   But ORBIT and DIRTY and IRONY are all valid.\n\n   Which one maximizes new information?\n\n   IRONY: letters I, R (which are known), and O, N, Y (new).\n   ORBIT: O, R, B, I, T -> letters: O, R, B, I, T -> known: R, I; new: O, B, T.\n   DIRTY: D, I, R, T, Y -> known: R, I; new: D, T, Y.\n\n   We haven\'t tested: O, B, T, D, Y, N.\n\n   T is a very common letter? So including T might be good? \n\n   Also, note: the secret word doesn\'t have A, E, S -> so likely has T or O or other vowels? \n\n   Let\'s rank common letters: T, O, L, N, C, etc.\n\n   IRONY: O and N are common? Also Y is less common.\n   ORBIT: O and T are common? and B is less common? \n   DIRTY: T and D? and Y.\n\n   ORBIT covers two common letters (O and T) and one less common (B). \n\n   But note: we only have 6 guesses, so we want to cover more common letters? \n\n   Alternatively, we can look for a word that includes T and O? Like ORTIC? not a word.\n\n   Another word: ""POINT"" -> but does not contain R? We are forced to include R and I? Because they are known present? \n\n   Without R and I, we\'d be ignoring known presence? So we must include both.\n\n   Therefore, ORBIT (with O, R, B, I, T) seems to cover T and O? And B? \n\n   Alternatively, ""TROOP"" -> duplicate O and R? We avoid duplicates? and also R must not in position 1? TROOP has R at 1? -> invalid because R at 1 is disallowed for this guess? \n\n   Also, it doesn\'t have I? \n\n   How about ""TOUCH"" -> no R or I.\n\n   Therefore, from the candidates:\n\n      ORBIT: \n          Position 1: O (new)\n          Position 2: R (we don\'t know about position 2 but R was only tested in 1? so this is new for R? So we might get ✓ or - for R? We hope for ✓)\n          Position 3: B (new)\n          Position 4: I (I was tested only in position 3? so testing I in 4? that\'s new? so we might get ✓ or - for I? We hope for ✓)\n          Position 5: T (new)\n\n      This seems good? \n\n      DIRTY: \n          Position 1: D (new)\n          Position 2: I (new for I? because I was tested in 3? So testing I in 2? okay)\n          Position 3: R (new for R? because R was tested in 1? So okay)\n          Position 4: T (new)\n          Position 5: Y (new)\n\n      This also seems good? \n\n   ORBIT might be better because it includes the common letter T? But DIRTY has T too? and also D and Y? \n\n   Actually, both have T? \n\n   ORBIT: common letters O and T? DIRTY: common letters T and D? Let me check commonness:\n      According to English letter frequency: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, ...\n\n      But since A, E are absent, T and O are more common? \n\n   Also, ORBIT introduces three consonants and one vowel? secret word might have O.\n\n   However, note feedback: RAISE had I which we know is present? but we don\'t know about vowels? because the secret word doesn\'t have E or A? so O or U might be present? \n\n   Since ORBIT includes O? if O is present? then also B and T? \n\n   We are looking for maximum information? \n\n   How about ""POINT"" -> doesn\'t have R? invalid? Because we must include R? \n\n   Another word: ""TRIPY""? not a word.\n\n   Let me check ""RIGHT"": \n        R at 1 -> forbidden? But we can\'t put R at 1? not allowed? \n        So ""WRING"": \n           W at 1? then R at 2? I at 3? Forbidden: I cannot be at 3? \n        So we must avoid I at 3.\n\n   So ""WRING"" is invalid? Because I at 3? \n\n   How about ""FRUIT"": \n        F, R, U, I, T -> \n        R at position 2? Okay? \n        I at position 4? Okay? \n        Contains U? Haven\'t tested U? \n        But has F and T? \n        Also, it uses U? \n\n        And it doesn\'t contain forbidden letters: A, S, E? \n\n        Yes: ""FRUIT"" is a word? Yes.\n\n   Now compare FRUIT, ORBIT, DIRTY, IRONY.\n\n   FRUIT: F, R, U, I, T -> new: F, U, T? known: R, I? \n   DIRTY: D, I, R, T, Y -> known: R, I; new: D, T, Y? \n   ORBIT: O, R, B, I, T -> known: R, I; new: O, B, T? \n   IRONY: I, R, O, N, Y -> known: R, I; new: O, N, Y? \n\n   Which one gives most information? \n\n   We want to test letters that are common? \n\n   Common consonants: T is very common? So T appears in FRUIT, ORBIT, and DIRTY? \n   FRUIT also tests U which is a vowel? and F which is common? \n\n   Actually, T is in the top 3? O in the top 5? \n\n   Therefore, ORBIT tests O (high) and T (high) and B (less common)? \n   FRUIT tests U (vowel? common) and T (high) and F (common)? \n   DIRTY tests D (common? above average), T and Y (less common)? \n\n   Let me see:\n\n      FRUIT: F is the 6th most common consonant? T is 2nd? U is vowel? \n      But U is the 7th most common letter? \n\n      ORBIT: O is the 4th? T is 2nd? B is not that common? \n\n      So FRUIT might be better because it has U? which is a vowel? \n\n   However, we cannot say? \n\n   Another candidate: ""BUILT"" -> has U and I? but I? R is missing? \n\n   We must include R? \n\n   How about ""FLIRT"": \n        F, L, I, R, T -> \n        Positions: R at 4? I at 3? Wait? I at position 3? forbidden? \n\n   Because we cannot put I at position 3? so avoid? \n\n   How about ""TRYST""? Has duplicate T? and Y? but no I? \n\n   We must include I? \n\n   Final decision: \n\n   Given that we know the secret word has R and I? and excludes A, E, S? and we have no idea about duplicates? \n\n   We choose a word that uses R and I in new positions? and includes three new common letters? \n\n   ORBIT: \n        Position 1: O -> if O is present, might help? \n        Position 2: R -> because R was tested only in 1? we try position 2? might be correct? or wrong? \n        Position 4: I -> move? testing position 4? \n        Position 5: T -> common? \n\n   DIRTY: \n        Position 1: D -> might be common? \n        Position 2: I -> since I was at 3? we test position 2? \n        Position 3: R -> testing position 3 for R? \n        Position 4: T -> common? \n\n   Another one: ""OUTER"" -> contains E? forbidden? \n\n   How about ""QUIRK""? \n        Q, U, I, R, K -> \n        Positions: I at position 3? forbidden? \n        Not allowed? \n\n   Let me think of words that put I at 1, R at 5? \n        Example: ""INTRO"" -> \n             I at 1? R at 5? \n             But the word has N,T,R,O? and I? \n             I at 1: not tested before? \n             R at 5: new position? \n             But also has N, T, R, O? \n        The word ""INTRO"" is valid? \n\n        INTRO: I at position 1 (okay), N at 2, T at 3, R at 4 (wait? R at 4? because spelling: I-N-T-R-O? So positions:\n          1: I\n          2: N\n          3: T\n          4: R\n          5: O\n\n        I at 1: allowed? because we only know I is not at 3? \n        R at 4: allowed? because R not at 1? and 4 is new? \n\n        So ""INTRO"" is a candidate: I, N, T, R, O? \n        Letters: I, N, T, R, O? \n        Known: I and R? \n        New: N, T, O? \n\n   So INTRO: new common letters O, T? and N? \n\n   ORBIT, INTRO, IRONY are similar? \n\n   We need to choose one? \n\n   Let\'s pick ORBIT? Because it uses R at position 2 and I at position 4? which are two new positions? and INTRO has I at 1? which is also new? \n\n   ORBIT has T at the end? which might be important.\n\n   Alternatively, we can pick ""POINT"" -> wait, no R? We must include R? \n\n   Final choice? ORBIT: because it uses two common letters O and T? and the word is common? \n\n   But another? How about ""BIRTH"":\n        B, I, R, T, H -> \n        I at position 2: okay? \n        R at position 3: okay? \n        But note: the word has BIRTH -> I at 2, R at 3? \n        Also, no forbidden positions? \n        The letter B? \n\n   We\'ll go with ORBIT? \n\n   However, note: ORBIT has too many common letters? \n\n   But I think ORBIT is fine.\n\n   So I guess: ORBIT\n\n   Let\'s write it: O-R-B-I-T.\n\n   Reminder of constraints:\n        R is present -> in ORBIT, we put R at position 2? \n        I is present -> put at position 4? \n        Avoid position 1 for R? Avoid position 3 for I? satisfied.\n\n   Also, doesn\'t use A, S, E? \n\n   Yes? ORBIT: letters O, R, B, I, T -> none of A, S, E.\n\n   So ORBIT is a valid word.\n\n   We output: <guess>ORBIT</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guess ""RAISE"":\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`)\n- A is not in the secret word (marked with `x`)\n- I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked with `-`)\n- S and E are not in the secret word (marked with `x`)\n\nKey deductions:\n1.

So position 1 could be I or any other new letter that is present? but we don\'t know what is present besides R,I,O? we don\'t know? So position 1 must be I or a new letter that we haven\'t tested?

A, S, and E are absent (`x`).\n   - **Guess 3 (ORBIT)**:\n     - O is present but not in position 1 (`-`).\n     - R is present but not in position 2 (`-`), confirming RAISE\'s feedback that R cannot be position 1 and now adding position 2 as incorrect.\n     - I is present but not in position 4 (`-`), confirming RAISE\'s feedback that I cannot be position 3 and now adding position 4 as incorrect.\n     - B and T are absent (`x`), along with previously excluded A, S, E.\n\n2. **Key Deductions**:\n   - **Present Letters**: R, I, O (must all be included in the next guess).\n   - **Absent Letters**: A, E, S, B, T (excluded from all guesses).\n   - **Position Constraints**:\n     - R: Cannot be in positions 1–2 → must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.\n     - I: Cannot be in positions 3–4 → must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.\n     - O: Cannot be in position 1 → must be in positions 2–5.\n   - **Unused Letters**: Letters not yet tested are: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:\n   - Must include R, I, O in positions that satisfy constraints:\n     - I and O could compete for position 2, requiring I to be placed in 1 or 5 without conflict.\n     - Place R in a new position (3, 4, or 5) since positions 1–2 are invalid.\n     - Introduce new common letters to maximize information (e.g., G, V).\n   - Avoid positional conflicts:\n     - I cannot be at 3 or 4; R cannot be at 1 or 2; O cannot be at 1.\n     - Positions 1, 5 are candidates for I if O is elsewhere (e.g., O at 5).\n\n4. **Candidate Word Selection**:\n   - Explore words with I at position 2 (untested), R at position 3 (allowed), and O at position 5 (untested).\n   - Use new letters (e.g., V, G) to cover more ground.\n   - **Chosen Word: ""VIRGO""**:\n     - **V**: Untested consonant; common enough to gather feedback.\n     - **I**: Position 2 (allowed; contradicts both position 3 and 4 constraints).\n     - **R**: Position 3 (allowed; avoids positions 1-2).\n     - **G**: Untested consonant; moderate frequency.\n     - **O**: Position 5 (allowed; avoids position 1).\n   - **Validity**: ""VIRGO"" uses exclusively absent letters and satisfies all known constraints:\n     - Confirmed presence of R, I, O.\n     - Tests I in a new position (2) and O in a new position (5).\n     - Introduces V and G as new probes.\n     - Avoids A, E, S, B, T.\n\n5. **Information Gain**:\n   - **If VIRGO hits**: Positions for R, I, O are validated.\n   - **If not**: Feedback on V/G (absent/present) and positional tweaks for R, I, O will further narrow possibilities.\n\n<guess>VIRGO</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: and -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\nGuess 2: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 3: ORBIT -> FEEDBACK: O(-) R(-) B(x) I(-) T(x)\nGuess 4: VIRGO -> FEEDBACK: V(x) I(✓) R(-) G(x) O(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for Guess 4: VIRGO -> V(x) I(✓) R(-) G(x) O(✓)

This means:
- V is not in the secret word.
- I is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
- R is in the secret word but not in position 3 (where we placed it).
- G is not in the secret word.
- O is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).

Combining with prior feedback:
- From Guess 2: R is present (but not in pos 1), I is present (but not in pos 3).
- From Guess 3: O is present (but not in pos 1), R is present (but not in pos 2), B and T absent.
- Now: I is fixed at position 2 (from VIRGO: I(✓)), O is fixed at position 5 (from VIRGO: O(✓)).
- R is present but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Why?
    - From Guess 2: R not in pos 1 (from RAISE: R(-) at pos 1)
    - From Guess 3: R not in pos 2 (from ORBIT: R(-) at pos 2)
    - From Guess 4: R not in pos 3 (from VIRGO: R(-) at pos 3)
- Therefore, R must be in position 4 (since the only remaining position is 4? Because positions: 1,2,3 are ruled out, and position 5 is occupied by O).

Positions:
1: ? 
2: I (fixed)
3: ? 
4: ? 
5: O (fixed)

And R must be in one of the positions? The remaining positions are 1,3,4? But we have constraints:
R cannot be at 1,2,3? and 2 and 5 are taken? So R must be at 4? 

Yes, because the only open positions are 1, 3, 4? and R cannot be at 1 or 3? So R must be at position 4.

Thus, we know:
- Position 2: I
- Position 4: R? (since R cannot be at 1,2,3? and 5 is taken? so must be 4? 
But wait: in VIRGO, R was at 3? and marked '-', so it cannot be at 3? And before it cannot be at 1 or 2? So the only possibility? positions 4? 

But what about position 5? Position 5 is O? fixed? 

Yes? Therefore, position 4 must be R? 

So we update:
- Position 2: I
- Position 4: R? 
- Position 5: O

Then positions 1 and 3: to be filled with letters that are not absent? 

Now, we know the secret word pattern: [letter1] I [letter3] R O

Also, from absent letters: A, E, S, B, T, G, V are absent (and previously: S, E, A, B, T, now adding V and G? all absent).

So the secret word is composed of letters excluding: A, E, S, B, T, G, V.

Available letters: C, D, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

And we have two positions: 1 and 3.

Now, the word must be a valid English 5-letter word: ? I ? R O

We need to find a word that fits this pattern: first letter from available, then I, then third letter from available, then R, then O.

Let's list possible words:

Common words ending with ""I R O"": 
- HERO? but H-E-R-O? E is absent? not allowed? 
- Also, we have ? I ? R O

Possible words: 
- ""BIRO"": B is absent? 
- ""GIRO"": G is absent? 
- ""KIRO"": but QIRO? ... not common? 

Wait, ""KIRO"" may not be English? 

Alternatively: 
- ""CIRRO"": not five letters? 
- ""FIRDO"": ""FIR"" D O? FIRDO? not a word? 

Actual words: 
- ""MICRO"": M-I-C-R-O? 
  Positions: 
    Position1: M? 
    Position2: I? 
    Position3: C?
    Position4: R?
    Position5: O?
  And letters: M, C? both available? 
  But we have C? M? 

  Also, note: absent letters? no: M and C are available? 

Is ""MICRO"" a valid English word? Yes: short for microcomputer or micrometer.

Another word: ""MACRO"": but A is absent? 

"" TIR O"": T absent? 

""PIRO"" words? But we have two letters before? 

How about ""BIROS""? too long? 

""MINOR"": M-I-N-O-R? but then O is supposed to be at 5? and R at 4? 
In MINOR: 
  Position1: M
  Position2: I
  Position3: N
  Position4: O? but we require R at 4? 
  Position5: R? 
But that conflicts? because we require O at 5? So MINOR would be M-I-N-O-R? which is fixed? but we have I at 2? O at 5? R at 4? 

But MINOR has R at 5? not 4? and O at 4? not 5? 

Therefore, we need pattern: ? I ? R O

So like X I Y R O

Words:
- ""SIROC"": S is absent? 
- ""HIRO"": only 4 letters? 
- ""GYROS"": 5 letters but G absent? 
- ""LYROS"": L-Y-R-O-S? S absent? 
- ""PIROG"": PIROG? P-I-R-O-G? G absent? 
- ""CIRRO"": not 5? 
- ""FIRRO"": F-I-R-R-O? duplicate R? 

But we are allowed duplicates? if the secret has duplicates? 
However, we don't know? 

But given the feedback? we haven't have any instance? 

Possible word: ""MICRO"" as above? 

But we also have: ""TIRO"" + S? 

Another: ""WIRO"": not common? 

Available: C,D,F,H,K,L,M,N,P,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z

Let me try to form: 
CIRRO? no? 
Use common letters? 

H I F R O? ""HIFRO"" not a word? 
D I R O? 

Systematically: 
We can use a dictionary? since this is reasoning? 

Common words: 
- MICRO (all letters valid: M, I, C, R, O) -> M and C are not in the absent list? 
  - Given the constraints: positions match? and letters M and C are not excluded? 

Other words? 
- ""NICRO"": not English? 
- ""K I R O"" with one more letter? K at 1 and C at 3? not?
- ""MICRO"" and ""MACRO"" (A absent? invalid)? 

Another valid word: ""ZEROS"" not? 

""V I R U S"" but V absent? and S absent? 

So is there ""MICRO"" and what else? 

""INFRA"" but A absent? 

So ""MICRO"" seems a strong candidate? 

But let's confirm pattern: M I C R O
Positions: 
1: M? 
2: I? 
3: C? 
4: R? 
5: O? 

Checks: 
- M: not tested? so possible? 
- C: not tested? 
- R at 4? not tested at 4? 
- Absent letters: none used? so valid? 

Therefore, we guess ""MICRO""? 

But what if the secret word is not ""MICRO""? Then we'll get feedback? 

Other possibilities: 
- ""DIORO""? not a word? 
- ""LIRO"": 4 letters? 
- ""WIROS"": not plural? 
- ""MYTHO"" not?

We'll go with ""MICRO"" as it fits? 

But note: we have not tested M or C? so if wrong? we learn about them? 

So guess: MICRO

Then format: <guess>MICRO</guess>

Alternatively? we know R must be at 4? and I at 2? O at 5? so only positions 1 and 3 unknown? 

With MICRO? we cover that? 

So it is the most likely? 

But if we want to be safe? 

But given the constraints? it's a strong candidate? 

Therefore? let's guess MICRO? 

Let me double-check: 

Secret word pattern: ? I ? R O

Previous absent: A,E,S,B,T,G,V? 

Available letters for position 1: C,D,F,H,K,L,M,N,P,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z

For position 3: same? 

Common words: 
- MICRO
- Also? ""CIGRO"" not? 
- ""CYRO""? not?

While ""MICRO"" is valid? so we output MICRO? 

If not? we might get another chance? since we have 2 guesses left? 

So we go with ""MICRO""

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze previous feedback**:
   - **VIRGO (Guess 4)**: 
     - I(✓) at position 2 and O(✓) at position 5 → **I and O are fixed** in these positions.
     - R(-) at position 3 → R is present but **not in position 3**.
     - V(x) and G(x) → **V and G are absent**.
   - **ORBIT (Guess 3)**:
     - R not in position 2, O not in position 1, B and T absent (confirmed).
   - **RAISE (Guess 2)**:
     - R not in position 1, I not in position 3, A/S/E absent (confirmed).

2. **Key deductions**:
   - **Fixed positions**:
     - Position 2: **I**
     - Position 5: **O**
   - **R constraints**: Cannot be in positions 1 (RAISE), 2 (ORBIT), or 3 (VIRGO). The **only remaining slot is position 4** → **R must be in position 4**.
   - **Absent letters**: A, E, S, B, T, G, V.
   - **Available positions**: Position 1 and 3 require new valid letters.
   - **Remaining usable letters**: C, D, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

3. **Word selection**:
   - Current pattern: **`[?] I [?] R O`**.
   - Need a valid 5-letter word fitting:
     - Consists of letters excluding absent set (A, E, S, B, T, G, V).
     - Must be English and plausible.
   - **""MICRO""**:
     - Letters: **M** (position 1), **I** (position 2), **C** (position 3), **R** (position 4), **O** (position 5).
     - Satisfies constraints:
       - Position 4: R (required).
       - Uses untested letters (M, C) → Gain feedback on them if incorrect.
     - Common scientific term → Valid English word.

4. **Expected outcomes**:
   - If correct → Wins.
   - If incorrect → Feedback reveals status of M and C (absent/present) and refines guesses for positions 1 and 3.

Given this, **MICRO** is the optimal guess to solve or advance the game with maximum information gain.

<guess>MICRO</guess>",MICRO,"We are given feedback for Guess 4: VIRGO -> V(x) I(✓) R(-) G(x) O(✓)

This means:
- V is not in the secret word.
- I is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
- R is in the secret word but not in position 3 (where we placed it).
- G is not in the secret word.
- O is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).

Combining with prior feedback:
- From Guess 2: R is present (but not in pos 1), I is present (but not in pos 3).
- From Guess 3: O is present (but not in pos 1), R is present (but not in pos 2), B and T absent.
- Now: I is fixed at position 2 (from VIRGO: I(✓)), O is fixed at position 5 (from VIRGO: O(✓)).
- R is present but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Why?
    - From Guess 2: R not in pos 1 (from RAISE: R(-) at pos 1)
    - From Guess 3: R not in pos 2 (from ORBIT: R(-) at pos 2)
    - From Guess 4: R not in pos 3 (from VIRGO: R(-) at pos 3)
- Therefore, R must be in position 4 (since the only remaining position is 4? Because positions: 1,2,3 are ruled out, and position 5 is occupied by O).

Positions:
1: ? 
2: I (fixed)
3: ? 
4: ? 
5: O (fixed)

And R must be in one of the positions? The remaining positions are 1,3,4? But we have constraints:
R cannot be at 1,2,3? and 2 and 5 are taken? So R must be at 4? 

Yes, because the only open positions are 1, 3, 4? and R cannot be at 1 or 3? So R must be at position 4.

Thus, we know:
- Position 2: I
- Position 4: R? (since R cannot be at 1,2,3? and 5 is taken? so must be 4? 
But wait: in VIRGO, R was at 3? and marked '-', so it cannot be at 3? And before it cannot be at 1 or 2? So the only possibility? positions 4? 

But what about position 5? Position 5 is O? fixed? 

Yes? Therefore, position 4 must be R? 

So we update:
- Position 2: I
- Position 4: R? 
- Position 5: O

Then positions 1 and 3: to be filled with letters that are not absent? 

Now, we know the secret word pattern: [letter1] I [letter3] R O

Also, from absent letters: A, E, S, B, T, G, V are absent (and previously: S, E, A, B, T, now adding V and G? all absent).

So the secret word is composed of letters excluding: A, E, S, B, T, G, V.

Available letters: C, D, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

And we have two positions: 1 and 3.

Now, the word must be a valid English 5-letter word: ? I ? R O

We need to find a word that fits this pattern: first letter from available, then I, then third letter from available, then R, then O.

Let's list possible words:

Common words ending with ""I R O"": 
- HERO? but H-E-R-O? E is absent? not allowed? 
- Also, we have ? I ? R O

Possible words: 
- ""BIRO"": B is absent? 
- ""GIRO"": G is absent? 
- ""KIRO"": but QIRO? ... not common? 

Wait, ""KIRO"" may not be English? 

Alternatively: 
- ""CIRRO"": not five letters? 
- ""FIRDO"": ""FIR"" D O? FIRDO? not a word? 

Actual words: 
- ""MICRO"": M-I-C-R-O? 
  Positions: 
    Position1: M? 
    Position2: I? 
    Position3: C?
    Position4: R?
    Position5: O?
  And letters: M, C? both available? 
  But we have C? M? 

  Also, note: absent letters? no: M and C are available? 

Is ""MICRO"" a valid English word? Yes: short for microcomputer or micrometer.

Another word: ""MACRO"": but A is absent? 

"" TIR O"": T absent? 

""PIRO"" words? But we have two letters before? 

How about ""BIROS""? too long? 

""MINOR"": M-I-N-O-R? but then O is supposed to be at 5? and R at 4? 
In MINOR: 
  Position1: M
  Position2: I
  Position3: N
  Position4: O? but we require R at 4? 
  Position5: R? 
But that conflicts? because we require O at 5? So MINOR would be M-I-N-O-R? which is fixed? but we have I at 2? O at 5? R at 4? 

But MINOR has R at 5? not 4? and O at 4? not 5? 

Therefore, we need pattern: ? I ? R O

So like X I Y R O

Words:
- ""SIROC"": S is absent? 
- ""HIRO"": only 4 letters? 
- ""GYROS"": 5 letters but G absent? 
- ""LYROS"": L-Y-R-O-S? S absent? 
- ""PIROG"": PIROG? P-I-R-O-G? G absent? 
- ""CIRRO"": not 5? 
- ""FIRRO"": F-I-R-R-O? duplicate R? 

But we are allowed duplicates? if the secret has duplicates? 
However, we don't know? 

But given the feedback? we haven't have any instance? 

Possible word: ""MICRO"" as above? 

But we also have: ""TIRO"" + S? 

Another: ""WIRO"": not common? 

Available: C,D,F,H,K,L,M,N,P,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z

Let me try to form: 
CIRRO? no? 
Use common letters? 

H I F R O? ""HIFRO"" not a word? 
D I R O? 

Systematically: 
We can use a dictionary? since this is reasoning? 

Common words: 
- MICRO (all letters valid: M, I, C, R, O) -> M and C are not in the absent list? 
  - Given the constraints: positions match? and letters M and C are not excluded? 

Other words? 
- ""NICRO"": not English? 
- ""K I R O"" with one more letter? K at 1 and C at 3? not?
- ""MICRO"" and ""MACRO"" (A absent? invalid)? 

Another valid word: ""ZEROS"" not? 

""V I R U S"" but V absent? and S absent? 

So is there ""MICRO"" and what else? 

""INFRA"" but A absent? 

So ""MICRO"" seems a strong candidate? 

But let's confirm pattern: M I C R O
Positions: 
1: M? 
2: I? 
3: C? 
4: R? 
5: O? 

Checks: 
- M: not tested? so possible? 
- C: not tested? 
- R at 4? not tested at 4? 
- Absent letters: none used? so valid? 

Therefore, we guess ""MICRO""? 

But what if the secret word is not ""MICRO""? Then we'll get feedback? 

Other possibilities: 
- ""DIORO""? not a word? 
- ""LIRO"": 4 letters? 
- ""WIROS"": not plural? 
- ""MYTHO"" not?

We'll go with ""MICRO"" as it fits? 

But note: we have not tested M or C? so if wrong? we learn about them? 

So guess: MICRO

Then format: <guess>MICRO</guess>

Alternatively? we know R must be at 4? and I at 2? O at 5? so only positions 1 and 3 unknown? 

With MICRO? we cover that? 

So it is the most likely? 

But if we want to be safe? 

But given the constraints? it's a strong candidate? 

Therefore? let's guess MICRO? 

Let me double-check: 

Secret word pattern: ? I ? R O

Previous absent: A,E,S,B,T,G,V? 

Available letters for position 1: C,D,F,H,K,L,M,N,P,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z

For position 3: same? 

Common words: 
- MICRO

- ""CYRO""? not?
