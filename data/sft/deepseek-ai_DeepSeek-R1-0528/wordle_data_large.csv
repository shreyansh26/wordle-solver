We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a guess that maximizes the information gained. A good starting word often includes common letters and tries to cover multiple common letters to get feedback on their presence and positions.

Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

We also want a word without repeating letters to test more letters at once.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E — which are common and in different positions.

Another good one is ""SLATE"", but let's stick with ""CRANE"".

My thought: Use ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

Therefore, I will guess: ""CRANE""

Remember to wrap it in the required XML tags.

First, I need to make my initial guess without any prior information. The goal is to choose a word that maximizes the information gained from the feedback. For the first guess, I should pick a word with common English letters to test as many frequent letters as possible. This helps identify which letters are present in the secret word and gather positional clues. 

Ideal starting words:
- Use 5 distinct letters to test more possibilities.
- Prioritize vowels (like A, E, I, O) and common consonants (like R, S, T, N) since they appear often in English words.
- Aim for balanced letter distribution (no repeats) and avoid rare letters.

After considering common choices, ""CRANE"" fits well:
- Letters: C (common consonant), R (frequent consonant), A (common vowel), N (common consonant), E (common vowel).
- It covers three vowels (A, E) and two consonants (C, R, N), increasing the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.
- No duplicates, so each letter's feedback will be unambiguous.

Other options like ""SLATE"" are also strong, but ""CRANE"" is a standard starting point. The choice is somewhat arbitrary since no clues exist, but CRANE is statistically effective. I'll go with ""CRANE"" for Guess 1.

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

Therefore, we know:
1. The secret word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
2. The letters R and A are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed. In ""crane"", R was the 2nd letter and A was the 3rd, so they cannot be in those positions in the secret word.
3. The letters C and N are not in the word at all.

We must choose a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Ends with E? Not necessarily, but we know the last letter is E, so it might be beneficial to use that. However, the feedback for E is correct, so we can keep E in the 5th position to maintain that known correct letter and focus on the others.
- Includes R and A (since they are in the word) but not in the 2nd and 3rd positions respectively? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So for the next guess, we should try R and A in different positions.

Also, we must avoid using C and N because they are not in the word.

Let's list the constraints for the next guess:
- The 5th letter must be E (because we know it's correct and in place). This is optional? Actually, we don't have to fix it, but it's beneficial to do so to test other positions. However, the rules don't require that we use known correct letters again, but it's a good strategy to confirm and build on known information.

But note: the feedback for E is a checkmark, meaning it is in the correct position. So the secret word has E at the end. Therefore, for the next guess, we can (and should) put E at the end to keep that position fixed and focus on the other letters.

So the secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ E

We also know that R and A are in the word, but not in the positions we had them (position 2 for R and position 3 for A). However, note that in the word ""crane"", the positions are:
1: C (absent)
2: R (present, but not here)
3: A (present, but not here)
4: N (absent)
5: E (correct)

So for the next guess, we should avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3. But they can be in other positions.

Additionally, we must not use C and N.

Now, we need to form a word that:
- Ends with E (5th letter is E)
- Contains R and A (since they are present)
- Does not contain C or N
- And we can use other letters to fill the remaining positions.

We have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, and 4? Actually, the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 5 is E. So we need to guess for positions 1,2,3,4.

But we also have two known letters (R and A) that must appear somewhere in positions 1-4, but not at position 2 for R and not at position 3 for A? Actually, the feedback only says that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong, and A was in position 3 and that was wrong. But they could be in other positions. Also, note that R and A might be in the same position? But we don't know yet.

We should try to place R and A in new positions and also introduce new letters to test.

Let's think of words that end with E and contain R and A, without C and N.

Possible words:
- We can try to put R at position 1 and A at position 4? But we don't know. We need to test.

Common words ending with E that have R and A:
- ""raise"": but note, we have to avoid the positions that were wrong in the first guess? Actually, we can use any positions except we know that R cannot be at position 2 (if we put R at position 2 again, it would be wrong again, but we can avoid that). Similarly, A cannot be at position 3.

In ""raise"":
- R at position 1
- A at position 2
- I at position 3
- S at position 4
- E at position 5

But in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and that was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 1. That's a new position, so it's okay. Similarly, A was at position 3 in the first guess, now we are putting A at position 2. That's also a new position, so it's acceptable.

But note: we don't know if R can be at position 1 or A at position 2. We are testing.

Also, we must avoid C and N, and ""raise"" doesn't have them.

Another word: ""arise"" -> A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But putting R at position 2: in the first guess, R was at position 2 and it was wrong. So if we put R at position 2 again, it will be wrong again? Not necessarily, because the feedback only said that in the first guess it was not in the correct position, but it might be that the secret word has R in position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would be incorrect because we know it's not there. Therefore, we should avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.

So for ""arise"":
- Position 1: A -> but we don't know if A can be at position 1? It can, because previously A was at position 3 and that was wrong, but position 1 is new.
- Position 2: R -> but we know R is not at position 2 (from first feedback), so we should avoid that. Therefore, ""arise"" is not a good choice because it puts R at position 2.

Similarly, ""raise"" has R at position 1 (which is new) and A at position 2 (which is new for A, since previously A was at position 3). So that's acceptable.

Another word: ""route"" -> but has O, U, T, and E. But we don't know if O, U, T are in the word. Also, it doesn't have A? We know A is in the word, so we must include A. So we need a word that has both R and A.

Let me list some words ending with E that contain R and A, without C or N, and without R in position 2 or A in position 3.

Possible words:
- ""raise"": as above, R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. This is good because R is not at 2 and A is not at 3.
- ""brace"": but B, R, A, C, E -> but C is in the word? We know C is not in the word (from first feedback: C is absent). So we cannot use C. So ""brace"" is invalid because of C.
- ""grape"": G, R, A, P, E -> no C or N. But let's check positions: 
  - If we use ""grape"": 
    - Position 1: G (new)
    - Position 2: R -> but we know R is not at position 2? Yes, from first feedback. So we should avoid position 2 for R. Therefore, ""grape"" is not good because it puts R at position 2.
- ""parse"": P, A, R, S, E -> 
  - Position 1: P
  - Position 2: A (this is a new position for A, since previously A was at 3, so position 2 is allowed for A)
  - Position 3: R -> but we know R is not at position 3? Actually, we only know R is not at position 2. Position 3 for R is allowed because we haven't tested it. Similarly, A at position 2 is allowed because previously A was at 3 and that was wrong, but position 2 is new for A.

Wait, but in the first guess, we only know that R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3. They can be at other positions.

So ""parse"":
- A at position 2: that's okay because we haven't tried A at position 2.
- R at position 3: that's okay because we haven't tried R at position 3.

But note: we also want to test new letters. We have to avoid C and N.

Another word: ""tare"" -> but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

""tare"" is 4, so not valid.

""share"": S, H, A, R, E -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: H
  - Position 3: A -> but we know A is not at position 3? From first feedback, A was at position 3 and it was wrong. So we should avoid putting A at position 3. Therefore, ""share"" is not good because it has A at position 3.

Similarly, ""carex"" has C and is 5 letters? But C is not allowed.

""drape"": D, R, A, P, E -> 
  - Position 1: D
  - Position 2: R -> but we know R is not at position 2, so avoid.

""frame"": F, R, A, M, E -> 
  - Position 1: F
  - Position 2: R -> again, R at position 2: avoid.

So we see that many words put R at position 2. We need to avoid that.

Let's try to put R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 5 is E, so R can be at 1,3,4.

Similarly, A can be at 1,2,4 (avoiding position 3).

So a word with R at 1 and A at 4? For example: ""rage"" -> 4 letters. We need 5.

""raze"": 4 letters.

""raise"" is a good candidate: R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

Another candidate: ""range"" -> but has N, which is not allowed.

""raced"" -> has C and D? But C is not allowed.

""raved"": R, A, V, E, D -> 
  - Position 1: R
  - Position 2: A -> A at position 2 is allowed (since previously A was at 3, so position 2 is new)
  - Position 3: V
  - Position 4: E -> but wait, we know the 5th is E, so position 4 is not E? Actually, we are putting E at position 5. So in ""raved"", the last letter is D? No, ""raved"" is R-A-V-E-D? That's 5 letters: positions 1:R, 2:A, 3:V, 4:E, 5:D. But we need the 5th to be E? Actually, we don't have to, but we know the secret word has E at the end. So if we don't put E at the end, then we lose the opportunity to confirm the E and also we might get feedback on the last letter. However, since we know E is at the end, it's better to keep it fixed to reduce uncertainty.

Therefore, we should choose a word that ends with E.

So ""raved"" ends with D, not E. So not good.

""raree"" -> not a common word, and has repeated E? Also, we don't know if R can be repeated.

But we don't have information about repeated letters. The secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't know. However, in the first guess, we had no repeats, and we got feedback that R and A are present, but we don't know if they are repeated.

But to be safe, let's avoid repeats for now.

Back to ""raise"": it ends with E, has R at 1, A at 2, and new letters I and S.

Also, we avoid C and N.

So ""raise"" seems a good candidate.

Another word: ""prise"": P, R, I, S, E -> 
  - Position 1: P
  - Position 2: R -> but we cannot put R at position 2. So avoid.

""arise"": A at 1, R at 2 -> R at position 2 is not allowed. Avoid.

""aesir""? Not a common word, and it ends with R, not E.

So ""raise"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: 
- We know the secret word has E at the end, and contains R and A (but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively in the first guess, but they can be elsewhere).
- In ""raise"": 
  - R is at position 1 (new position for R)
  - A is at position 2 (new position for A, since previously at 3)
  - I and S are new letters we haven't tested.

This will help us:
- If R is at position 1, we get feedback: if it's correct, then we know. If it's present but wrong position, then we know R is not at 1. Similarly for A at 2.
- Also, we test I and S.

So I think ""raise"" is a solid second guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""raise"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- **R** is present but not in position 2 (-).
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (-).
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with ""E"".

For the next guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" to maintain the known correct position.
- It must include ""R"" and ""A"" (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing ""R"" in position 2 or ""A"" in position 3 (as these positions were incorrect in the first guess).
- It should avoid ""C"" and ""N"" entirely.
- New letters should be introduced to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **""raise""**:
- Ends with ""E"" (position 5), leveraging the known correct letter.
- Places ""R"" in position 1 (a new position, avoiding position 2).
- Places ""A"" in position 2 (a new position, avoiding position 3).
- Introduces new letters ""I"" (position 3) and ""S"" (position 4) to test.
- Avoids ""C"" and ""N"".

This guess efficiently tests the presence and positions of ""R"" and ""A"" while exploring new letters.

<guess>raise</guess>",raise,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

Therefore, we know:
1. The secret word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
2. The letters R and A are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed. In ""crane"", R was the 2nd letter and A was the 3rd, so they cannot be in those positions in the secret word.
3. The letters C and N are not in the word at all.

But note: the feedback for E is a checkmark, meaning it is in the correct position. So the secret word has E at the end. Therefore, for the next guess, we can (and should) put E at the end to keep that position fixed and focus on the other letters.

So the secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ E

We also know that R and A are in the word, but not in the positions we had them (position 2 for R and position 3 for A). However, note that in the word ""crane"", the positions are:
1: C (absent)
2: R (present, but not here)
3: A (present, but not here)
4: N (absent)
5: E (correct)

So for the next guess, we should avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3. But they can be in other positions.

Additionally, we must not use C and N.

Now, we need to form a word that:
- Ends with E (5th letter is E)
- Contains R and A (since they are present)
- Does not contain C or N
- And we can use other letters to fill the remaining positions.

We have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, and 4? Actually, the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 5 is E. So we need to guess for positions 1,2,3,4.

But we also have two known letters (R and A) that must appear somewhere in positions 1-4, but not at position 2 for R and not at position 3 for A? Actually, the feedback only says that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong, and A was in position 3 and that was wrong. But they could be in other positions. Also, note that R and A might be in the same position? But we don't know yet.

We should try to place R and A in new positions and also introduce new letters to test.

Let's think of words that end with E and contain R and A, without C and N.

Possible words:
- We can try to put R at position 1 and A at position 4? But we don't know. We need to test.

Common words ending with E that have R and A:
- ""raise"": but note, we have to avoid the positions that were wrong in the first guess? Actually, we can use any positions except we know that R cannot be at position 2 (if we put R at position 2 again, it would be wrong again, but we can avoid that). Similarly, A cannot be at position 3.

In ""raise"":
- R at position 1
- A at position 2
- I at position 3
- S at position 4
- E at position 5

But in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and that was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 1. That's a new position, so it's okay. Similarly, A was at position 3 in the first guess, now we are putting A at position 2. That's also a new position, so it's acceptable.

But note: we don't know if R can be at position 1 or A at position 2. We are testing.

Also, we must avoid C and N, and ""raise"" doesn't have them.

Another word: ""arise"" -> A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But putting R at position 2: in the first guess, R was at position 2 and it was wrong. So if we put R at position 2 again, it will be wrong again? Not necessarily, because the feedback only said that in the first guess it was not in the correct position, but it might be that the secret word has R in position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would be incorrect because we know it's not there. Therefore, we should avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.

So for ""arise"":
- Position 1: A -> but we don't know if A can be at position 1? It can, because previously A was at position 3 and that was wrong, but position 1 is new.
- Position 2: R -> but we know R is not at position 2 (from first feedback), so we should avoid that. Therefore, ""arise"" is not a good choice because it puts R at position 2.

Similarly, ""raise"" has R at position 1 (which is new) and A at position 2 (which is new for A, since previously A was at position 3). So that's acceptable.

Another word: ""route"" -> but has O, U, T, and E. But we don't know if O, U, T are in the word. Also, it doesn't have A? We know A is in the word, so we must include A. So we need a word that has both R and A.

Let me list some words ending with E that contain R and A, without C or N, and without R in position 2 or A in position 3.

Possible words:
- ""raise"": as above, R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. This is good because R is not at 2 and A is not at 3.
- ""brace"": but B, R, A, C, E -> but C is in the word? We know C is not in the word (from first feedback: C is absent). So we cannot use C. So ""brace"" is invalid because of C.
- ""grape"": G, R, A, P, E -> no C or N. But let's check positions: 
  - If we use ""grape"": 
    - Position 1: G (new)
    - Position 2: R -> but we know R is not at position 2? Yes, from first feedback. So we should avoid position 2 for R. Therefore, ""grape"" is not good because it puts R at position 2.
- ""parse"": P, A, R, S, E -> 
  - Position 1: P
  - Position 2: A (this is a new position for A, since previously A was at 3, so position 2 is allowed for A)
  - Position 3: R -> but we know R is not at position 3? Actually, we only know R is not at position 2. Position 3 for R is allowed because we haven't tested it. Similarly, A at position 2 is allowed because previously A was at 3 and that was wrong, but position 2 is new for A.

Wait, but in the first guess, we only know that R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3. They can be at other positions.

So ""parse"":
- A at position 2: that's okay because we haven't tried A at position 2.
- R at position 3: that's okay because we haven't tried R at position 3.

But note: we also want to test new letters. We have to avoid C and N.

Another word: ""tare"" -> but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

""tare"" is 4, so not valid.

""share"": S, H, A, R, E -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: H
  - Position 3: A -> but we know A is not at position 3? From first feedback, A was at position 3 and it was wrong. So we should avoid putting A at position 3. Therefore, ""share"" is not good because it has A at position 3.

Similarly, ""carex"" has C and is 5 letters? But C is not allowed.

""drape"": D, R, A, P, E -> 
  - Position 1: D
  - Position 2: R -> but we know R is not at position 2, so avoid.

""frame"": F, R, A, M, E -> 
  - Position 1: F
  - Position 2: R -> again, R at position 2: avoid.

So we see that many words put R at position 2. We need to avoid that.

Let's try to put R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 5 is E, so R can be at 1,3,4.

Similarly, A can be at 1,2,4 (avoiding position 3).

So a word with R at 1 and A at 4? For example: ""rage"" -> 4 letters. We need 5.

""raze"": 4 letters.

""raise"" is a good candidate: R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

Another candidate: ""range"" -> but has N, which is not allowed.

""raced"" -> has C and D? But C is not allowed.

""raved"": R, A, V, E, D -> 
  - Position 1: R
  - Position 2: A -> A at position 2 is allowed (since previously A was at 3, so position 2 is new)
  - Position 3: V
  - Position 4: E -> but wait, we know the 5th is E, so position 4 is not E? Actually, we are putting E at position 5. So in ""raved"", the last letter is D? No, ""raved"" is R-A-V-E-D? That's 5 letters: positions 1:R, 2:A, 3:V, 4:E, 5:D. But we need the 5th to be E? Actually, we don't have to, but we know the secret word has E at the end. So if we don't put E at the end, then we lose the opportunity to confirm the E and also we might get feedback on the last letter. However, since we know E is at the end, it's better to keep it fixed to reduce uncertainty.

Therefore, we should choose a word that ends with E.

So ""raved"" ends with D, not E. So not good.

""raree"" -> not a common word, and has repeated E? Also, we don't know if R can be repeated.

But we don't have information about repeated letters. The secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't know. However, in the first guess, we had no repeats, and we got feedback that R and A are present, but we don't know if they are repeated.

But to be safe, let's avoid repeats for now.

Back to ""raise"": it ends with E, has R at 1, A at 2, and new letters I and S.

Also, we avoid C and N.

So ""raise"" seems a good candidate.

Another word: ""prise"": P, R, I, S, E -> 
  - Position 1: P
  - Position 2: R -> but we cannot put R at position 2. So avoid.

""arise"": A at 1, R at 2 -> R at position 2 is not allowed. Avoid.

""aesir""? Not a common word, and it ends with R, not E.

So ""raise"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: 
- We know the secret word has E at the end, and contains R and A (but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively in the first guess, but they can be elsewhere).
- In ""raise"": 
  - R is at position 1 (new position for R)
  - A is at position 2 (new position for A, since previously at 3)
  - I and S are new letters we haven't tested.

This will help us:
- If R is at position 1, we get feedback: if it's correct, then we know. If it's present but wrong position, then we know R is not at 1. Similarly for A at 2.
- Also, we test I and S.

So I think ""raise"" is a solid second guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""raise"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- **R** is present but not in position 2 (-).
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (-).
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with ""E"".

For the next guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" to maintain the known correct position.
- It must include ""R"" and ""A"" (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing ""R"" in position 2 or ""A"" in position 3 (as these positions were incorrect in the first guess).
- It should avoid ""C"" and ""N"" entirely.
- New letters should be introduced to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **""raise""**:
- Ends with ""E"" (position 5), leveraging the known correct letter.
- Places ""R"" in position 1 (a new position, avoiding position 2).
- Places ""A"" in position 2 (a new position, avoiding position 3).
- Introduces new letters ""I"" (position 3) and ""S"" (position 4) to test.
- Avoids ""C"" and ""N"".

This guess efficiently tests the presence and positions of ""R"" and ""A"" while exploring new letters.",Guess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,large,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a guess that maximizes the information gained. A good starting word often includes common letters and tries to cover multiple common letters to get feedback on their presence and positions.

Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

We also want a word without repeating letters to test more letters at once.

A popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E — which are common and in different positions.

Another good one is ""SLATE"", but let's stick with ""CRANE"".

My thought: Use ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

Therefore, I will guess: ""CRANE""

Remember to wrap it in the required XML tags.First, I need to make my initial guess without any prior information. The goal is to choose a word that maximizes the information gained from the feedback. For the first guess, I should pick a word with common English letters to test as many frequent letters as possible. This helps identify which letters are present in the secret word and gather positional clues. 

Ideal starting words:
- Use 5 distinct letters to test more possibilities.
- Prioritize vowels (like A, E, I, O) and common consonants (like R, S, T, N) since they appear often in English words.
- Aim for balanced letter distribution (no repeats) and avoid rare letters.

After considering common choices, ""CRANE"" fits well:
- Letters: C (common consonant), R (frequent consonant), A (common vowel), N (common consonant), E (common vowel).
- It covers three vowels (A, E) and two consonants (C, R, N), increasing the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.
- No duplicates, so each letter's feedback will be unambiguous.

Other options like ""SLATE"" are also strong, but ""CRANE"" is a standard starting point. The choice is somewhat arbitrary since no clues exist, but CRANE is statistically effective. I'll go with ""CRANE"" for Guess 1.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

Therefore, we know:
1. The secret word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).
2. The letters R and A are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed. In ""crane"", R was the 2nd letter and A was the 3rd, so they cannot be in those positions in the secret word.
3. The letters C and N are not in the word at all.

We must choose a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Ends with E? Not necessarily, but we know the last letter is E, so it might be beneficial to use that. However, the feedback for E is correct, so we can keep E in the 5th position to maintain that known correct letter and focus on the others.
- Includes R and A (since they are in the word) but not in the 2nd and 3rd positions respectively? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So for the next guess, we should try R and A in different positions.

Also, we must avoid using C and N because they are not in the word.

Let's list the constraints for the next guess:
- The 5th letter must be E (because we know it's correct and in place). This is optional? Actually, we don't have to fix it, but it's beneficial to do so to test other positions. However, the rules don't require that we use known correct letters again, but it's a good strategy to confirm and build on known information.

But note: the feedback for E is a checkmark, meaning it is in the correct position. So the secret word has E at the end. Therefore, for the next guess, we can (and should) put E at the end to keep that position fixed and focus on the other letters.

So the secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ E

We also know that R and A are in the word, but not in the positions we had them (position 2 for R and position 3 for A). However, note that in the word ""crane"", the positions are:
1: C (absent)
2: R (present, but not here)
3: A (present, but not here)
4: N (absent)
5: E (correct)

So for the next guess, we should avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3. But they can be in other positions.

Additionally, we must not use C and N.

Now, we need to form a word that:
- Ends with E (5th letter is E)
- Contains R and A (since they are present)
- Does not contain C or N
- And we can use other letters to fill the remaining positions.

We have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, and 4? Actually, the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 5 is E. So we need to guess for positions 1,2,3,4.

But we also have two known letters (R and A) that must appear somewhere in positions 1-4, but not at position 2 for R and not at position 3 for A? Actually, the feedback only says that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong, and A was in position 3 and that was wrong. But they could be in other positions. Also, note that R and A might be in the same position? But we don't know yet.

We should try to place R and A in new positions and also introduce new letters to test.

Let's think of words that end with E and contain R and A, without C and N.

Possible words:
- We can try to put R at position 1 and A at position 4? But we don't know. We need to test.

Common words ending with E that have R and A:
- ""raise"": but note, we have to avoid the positions that were wrong in the first guess? Actually, we can use any positions except we know that R cannot be at position 2 (if we put R at position 2 again, it would be wrong again, but we can avoid that). Similarly, A cannot be at position 3.

In ""raise"":
- R at position 1
- A at position 2
- I at position 3
- S at position 4
- E at position 5

But in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and that was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 1. That's a new position, so it's okay. Similarly, A was at position 3 in the first guess, now we are putting A at position 2. That's also a new position, so it's acceptable.

But note: we don't know if R can be at position 1 or A at position 2. We are testing.

Also, we must avoid C and N, and ""raise"" doesn't have them.

Another word: ""arise"" -> A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But putting R at position 2: in the first guess, R was at position 2 and it was wrong. So if we put R at position 2 again, it will be wrong again? Not necessarily, because the feedback only said that in the first guess it was not in the correct position, but it might be that the secret word has R in position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would be incorrect because we know it's not there. Therefore, we should avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.

So for ""arise"":
- Position 1: A -> but we don't know if A can be at position 1? It can, because previously A was at position 3 and that was wrong, but position 1 is new.
- Position 2: R -> but we know R is not at position 2 (from first feedback), so we should avoid that. Therefore, ""arise"" is not a good choice because it puts R at position 2.

Similarly, ""raise"" has R at position 1 (which is new) and A at position 2 (which is new for A, since previously A was at position 3). So that's acceptable.

Another word: ""route"" -> but has O, U, T, and E. But we don't know if O, U, T are in the word. Also, it doesn't have A? We know A is in the word, so we must include A. So we need a word that has both R and A.

Let me list some words ending with E that contain R and A, without C or N, and without R in position 2 or A in position 3.

Possible words:
- ""raise"": as above, R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. This is good because R is not at 2 and A is not at 3.
- ""brace"": but B, R, A, C, E -> but C is in the word? We know C is not in the word (from first feedback: C is absent). So we cannot use C. So ""brace"" is invalid because of C.
- ""grape"": G, R, A, P, E -> no C or N. But let's check positions: 
  - If we use ""grape"": 
    - Position 1: G (new)
    - Position 2: R -> but we know R is not at position 2? Yes, from first feedback. So we should avoid position 2 for R. Therefore, ""grape"" is not good because it puts R at position 2.
- ""parse"": P, A, R, S, E -> 
  - Position 1: P
  - Position 2: A (this is a new position for A, since previously A was at 3, so position 2 is allowed for A)
  - Position 3: R -> but we know R is not at position 3? Actually, we only know R is not at position 2. Position 3 for R is allowed because we haven't tested it. Similarly, A at position 2 is allowed because previously A was at 3 and that was wrong, but position 2 is new for A.

Wait, but in the first guess, we only know that R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3. They can be at other positions.

So ""parse"":
- A at position 2: that's okay because we haven't tried A at position 2.
- R at position 3: that's okay because we haven't tried R at position 3.

But note: we also want to test new letters. We have to avoid C and N.

Another word: ""tare"" -> but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

""tare"" is 4, so not valid.

""share"": S, H, A, R, E -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: H
  - Position 3: A -> but we know A is not at position 3? From first feedback, A was at position 3 and it was wrong. So we should avoid putting A at position 3. Therefore, ""share"" is not good because it has A at position 3.

Similarly, ""carex"" has C and is 5 letters? But C is not allowed.

""drape"": D, R, A, P, E -> 
  - Position 1: D
  - Position 2: R -> but we know R is not at position 2, so avoid.

""frame"": F, R, A, M, E -> 
  - Position 1: F
  - Position 2: R -> again, R at position 2: avoid.

So we see that many words put R at position 2. We need to avoid that.

Let's try to put R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 5 is E, so R can be at 1,3,4.

Similarly, A can be at 1,2,4 (avoiding position 3).

So a word with R at 1 and A at 4? For example: ""rage"" -> 4 letters. We need 5.

""raze"": 4 letters.

""raise"" is a good candidate: R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

Another candidate: ""range"" -> but has N, which is not allowed.

""raced"" -> has C and D? But C is not allowed.

""raved"": R, A, V, E, D -> 
  - Position 1: R
  - Position 2: A -> A at position 2 is allowed (since previously A was at 3, so position 2 is new)
  - Position 3: V
  - Position 4: E -> but wait, we know the 5th is E, so position 4 is not E? Actually, we are putting E at position 5. So in ""raved"", the last letter is D? No, ""raved"" is R-A-V-E-D? That's 5 letters: positions 1:R, 2:A, 3:V, 4:E, 5:D. But we need the 5th to be E? Actually, we don't have to, but we know the secret word has E at the end. So if we don't put E at the end, then we lose the opportunity to confirm the E and also we might get feedback on the last letter. However, since we know E is at the end, it's better to keep it fixed to reduce uncertainty.

Therefore, we should choose a word that ends with E.

So ""raved"" ends with D, not E. So not good.

""raree"" -> not a common word, and has repeated E? Also, we don't know if R can be repeated.

But we don't have information about repeated letters. The secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't know. However, in the first guess, we had no repeats, and we got feedback that R and A are present, but we don't know if they are repeated.

But to be safe, let's avoid repeats for now.

Back to ""raise"": it ends with E, has R at 1, A at 2, and new letters I and S.

Also, we avoid C and N.

So ""raise"" seems a good candidate.

Another word: ""prise"": P, R, I, S, E -> 
  - Position 1: P
  - Position 2: R -> but we cannot put R at position 2. So avoid.

""arise"": A at 1, R at 2 -> R at position 2 is not allowed. Avoid.

""aesir""? Not a common word, and it ends with R, not E.

So ""raise"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: 
- We know the secret word has E at the end, and contains R and A (but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively in the first guess, but they can be elsewhere).
- In ""raise"": 
  - R is at position 1 (new position for R)
  - A is at position 2 (new position for A, since previously at 3)
  - I and S are new letters we haven't tested.

This will help us:
- If R is at position 1, we get feedback: if it's correct, then we know. If it's present but wrong position, then we know R is not at 1. Similarly for A at 2.
- Also, we test I and S.

So I think ""raise"" is a solid second guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""raise"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- **R** is present but not in position 2 (-).
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (-).
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with ""E"".

For the next guess:
- The word must end with ""E"" to maintain the known correct position.
- It must include ""R"" and ""A"" (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing ""R"" in position 2 or ""A"" in position 3 (as these positions were incorrect in the first guess).
- It should avoid ""C"" and ""N"" entirely.
- New letters should be introduced to gather more information.

A strong candidate is **""raise""**:
- Ends with ""E"" (position 5), leveraging the known correct letter.
- Places ""R"" in position 1 (a new position, avoiding position 2).
- Places ""A"" in position 2 (a new position, avoiding position 3).
- Introduces new letters ""I"" (position 3) and ""S"" (position 4) to test.
- Avoids ""C"" and ""N"".

This guess efficiently tests the presence and positions of ""R"" and ""A"" while exploring new letters.

For the first guess, I should pick a word with common English letters to test as many frequent letters as possible. This helps identify which letters are present in the secret word and gather positional clues. \n\nIdeal starting words:\n- Use 5 distinct letters to test more possibilities.\n- Prioritize vowels (like A, E, I, O) and common consonants (like R, S, T, N) since they appear often in English words.\n- Aim for balanced letter distribution (no repeats) and avoid rare letters.\n\nAfter considering common choices, ""CRANE"" fits well:\n- Letters: C (common consonant), R (frequent consonant), A (common vowel), N (common consonant), E (common vowel).\n- It covers three vowels (A, E) and two consonants (C, R, N), increasing the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.\n- No duplicates, so each letter\'s feedback will be unambiguous.\n\nOther options like ""SLATE"" are also strong, but ""CRANE"" is a standard starting point. The choice is somewhat arbitrary since no clues exist, but CRANE is statistically effective. I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" for Guess 1.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)\n\nTherefore, we know:\n1. The secret word ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the 5th letter).\n2. The letters R and A are in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed. In ""crane"", R was the 2nd letter and A was the 3rd, so they cannot be in those positions in the secret word.\n3. The letters C and N are not in the word at all.\n\nWe must choose a second guess that:\n- Is a valid 5-letter English word.\n- Ends with E? Not necessarily, but we know the last letter is E, so it might be beneficial to use that. However, the feedback for E is correct, so we can keep E in the 5th position to maintain that known correct letter and focus on the others.\n- Includes R and A (since they are in the word) but not in the 2nd and 3rd positions respectively? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So for the next guess, we should try R and A in different positions.\n\nAlso, we must avoid using C and N because they are not in the word.\n\nLet\'s list the constraints for the next guess:\n- The 5th letter must be E (because we know it\'s correct and in place). This is optional? Actually, we don\'t have to fix it, but it\'s beneficial to do so to test other positions. However, the rules don\'t require that we use known correct letters again, but it\'s a good strategy to confirm and build on known information.\n\nBut note: the feedback for E is a checkmark, meaning it is in the correct position. So the secret word has E at the end. Therefore, for the next guess, we can (and should) put E at the end to keep that position fixed and focus on the other letters.\n\nSo the secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ E\n\nWe also know that R and A are in the word, but not in the positions we had them (position 2 for R and position 3 for A). However, note that in the word ""crane"", the positions are:\n1: C (absent)\n2: R (present, but not here)\n3: A (present, but not here)\n4: N (absent)\n5: E (correct)\n\nSo for the next guess, we should avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3. But they can be in other positions.\n\nAdditionally, we must not use C and N.\n\nNow, we need to form a word that:\n- Ends with E (5th letter is E)\n- Contains R and A (since they are present)\n- Does not contain C or N\n- And we can use other letters to fill the remaining positions.\n\nWe have three positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, and 4? Actually, the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 5 is E. So we need to guess for positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nBut we also have two known letters (R and A) that must appear somewhere in positions 1-4, but not at position 2 for R and not at position 3 for A? Actually, the feedback only says that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong, and A was in position 3 and that was wrong. But they could be in other positions. Also, note that R and A might be in the same position? But we don\'t know yet.\n\nWe should try to place R and A in new positions and also introduce new letters to test.\n\nLet\'s think of words that end with E and contain R and A, without C and N.\n\nPossible words:\n- We can try to put R at position 1 and A at position 4? But we don\'t know. We need to test.\n\nCommon words ending with E that have R and A:\n- ""raise"": but note, we have to avoid the positions that were wrong in the first guess? Actually, we can use any positions except we know that R cannot be at position 2 (if we put R at position 2 again, it would be wrong again, but we can avoid that). Similarly, A cannot be at position 3.\n\nIn ""raise"":\n- R at position 1\n- A at position 2\n- I at position 3\n- S at position 4\n- E at position 5\n\nBut in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and that was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 1. That\'s a new position, so it\'s okay. Similarly, A was at position 3 in the first guess, now we are putting A at position 2. That\'s also a new position, so it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if R can be at position 1 or A at position 2. We are testing.\n\nAlso, we must avoid C and N, and ""raise"" doesn\'t have them.\n\nAnother word: ""arise"" -> A at 1, R at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But putting R at position 2: in the first guess, R was at position 2 and it was wrong. So if we put R at position 2 again, it will be wrong again? Not necessarily, because the feedback only said that in the first guess it was not in the correct position, but it might be that the secret word has R in position 2? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R at position 2 again, it would be incorrect because we know it\'s not there. Therefore, we should avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.\n\nSo for ""arise"":\n- Position 1: A -> but we don\'t know if A can be at position 1? It can, because previously A was at position 3 and that was wrong, but position 1 is new.\n- Position 2: R -> but we know R is not at position 2 (from first feedback), so we should avoid that. Therefore, ""arise"" is not a good choice because it puts R at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""raise"" has R at position 1 (which is new) and A at position 2 (which is new for A, since previously A was at position 3). So that\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother word: ""route"" -> but has O, U, T, and E. But we don\'t know if O, U, T are in the word. Also, it doesn\'t have A? We know A is in the word, so we must include A. So we need a word that has both R and A.\n\nLet me list some words ending with E that contain R and A, without C or N, and without R in position 2 or A in position 3.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""raise"": as above, R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. This is good because R is not at 2 and A is not at 3.\n- ""brace"": but B, R, A, C, E -> but C is in the word? We know C is not in the word (from first feedback: C is absent). So we cannot use C. So ""brace"" is invalid because of C.\n- ""grape"": G, R, A, P, E -> no C or N. But let\'s check positions: \n  - If we use ""grape"": \n    - Position 1: G (new)\n    - Position 2: R -> but we know R is not at position 2? Yes, from first feedback. So we should avoid position 2 for R. Therefore, ""grape"" is not good because it puts R at position 2.\n- ""parse"": P, A, R, S, E -> \n  - Position 1: P\n  - Position 2: A (this is a new position for A, since previously A was at 3, so position 2 is allowed for A)\n  - Position 3: R -> but we know R is not at position 3? Actually, we only know R is not at position 2. Position 3 for R is allowed because we haven\'t tested it. Similarly, A at position 2 is allowed because previously A was at 3 and that was wrong, but position 2 is new for A.\n\nWait, but in the first guess, we only know that R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3. They can be at other positions.\n\nSo ""parse"":\n- A at position 2: that\'s okay because we haven\'t tried A at position 2.\n- R at position 3: that\'s okay because we haven\'t tried R at position 3.\n\nBut note: we also want to test new letters. We have to avoid C and N.\n\nAnother word: ""tare"" -> but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\n""tare"" is 4, so not valid.\n\n""share"": S, H, A, R, E -> \n  - Position 1: S\n  - Position 2: H\n  - Position 3: A -> but we know A is not at position 3? From first feedback, A was at position 3 and it was wrong. So we should avoid putting A at position 3. Therefore, ""share"" is not good because it has A at position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""carex"" has C and is 5 letters? But C is not allowed.\n\n""drape"": D, R, A, P, E -> \n  - Position 1: D\n  - Position 2: R -> but we know R is not at position 2, so avoid.\n\n""frame"": F, R, A, M, E -> \n  - Position 1: F\n  - Position 2: R -> again, R at position 2: avoid.\n\nSo we see that many words put R at position 2. We need to avoid that.\n\nLet\'s try to put R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 5 is E, so R can be at 1,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, A can be at 1,2,4 (avoiding position 3).\n\nSo a word with R at 1 and A at 4? For example: ""rage"" -> 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n""raze"": 4 letters.\n\n""raise"" is a good candidate: R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5.\n\nAnother candidate: ""range"" -> but has N, which is not allowed.\n\n""raced"" -> has C and D? But C is not allowed.\n\n""raved"": R, A, V, E, D -> \n  - Position 1: R\n  - Position 2: A -> A at position 2 is allowed (since previously A was at 3, so position 2 is new)\n  - Position 3: V\n  - Position 4: E -> but wait, we know the 5th is E, so position 4 is not E? Actually, we are putting E at position 5. So in ""raved"", the last letter is D? No, ""raved"" is R-A-V-E-D? That\'s 5 letters: positions 1:R, 2:A, 3:V, 4:E, 5:D. But we need the 5th to be E? Actually, we don\'t have to, but we know the secret word has E at the end. So if we don\'t put E at the end, then we lose the opportunity to confirm the E and also we might get feedback on the last letter. However, since we know E is at the end, it\'s better to keep it fixed to reduce uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, we should choose a word that ends with E.\n\nSo ""raved"" ends with D, not E. So not good.\n\n""raree"" -> not a common word, and has repeated E? Also, we don\'t know if R can be repeated.\n\nBut we don\'t have information about repeated letters. The secret word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t know. However, in the first guess, we had no repeats, and we got feedback that R and A are present, but we don\'t know if they are repeated.\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s avoid repeats for now.\n\nBack to ""raise"": it ends with E, has R at 1, A at 2, and new letters I and S.\n\nAlso, we avoid C and N.\n\nSo ""raise"" seems a good candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""prise"": P, R, I, S, E -> \n  - Position 1: P\n  - Position 2: R -> but we cannot put R at position 2. So avoid.\n\n""arise"": A at 1, R at 2 -> R at position 2 is not allowed. Avoid.\n\n""aesir""? Not a common word, and it ends with R, not E.\n\nSo ""raise"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- We know the secret word has E at the end, and contains R and A (but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively in the first guess, but they can be elsewhere).\n- In ""raise"": \n  - R is at position 1 (new position for R)\n  - A is at position 2 (new position for A, since previously at 3)\n  - I and S are new letters we haven\'t tested.\n\nThis will help us:\n- If R is at position 1, we get feedback: if it\'s correct, then we know. If it\'s present but wrong position, then we know R is not at 1. Similarly for A at 2.\n- Also, we test I and S.\n\nSo I think ""raise"" is a solid second guess.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""raise"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** and **N** are absent (x), so they can be excluded from future guesses.\n- **R** is present but not in position 2 (-).\n- **A** is present but not in position 3 (-).\n- **E** is correct and in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with ""E"".\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with ""E"" to maintain the known correct position.\n- It must include ""R"" and ""A"" (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing ""R"" in position 2 or ""A"" in position 3 (as these positions were incorrect in the first guess).\n- It should avoid ""C"" and ""N"" entirely.\n- New letters should be introduced to gather more information.\n\nA strong candidate is **""raise""**:\n- Ends with ""E"" (position 5), leveraging the known correct letter.\n- Places ""R"" in position 1 (a new position, avoiding position 2).\n- Places ""A"" in position 2 (a new position, avoiding position 3).\n- Introduces new letters ""I"" (position 3) and ""S"" (position 4) to test.\n- Avoids ""C"" and ""N"".\n\nThis guess efficiently tests the presence and positions of ""R"" and ""A"" while exploring new letters.\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:
- Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
- Guess 2: raise -> R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)

From this, we know:
1. The secret word ends with E (position 5).
2. E is in position 5 (known correct and maintained in both guesses).
3. From guess 1:
   - C and N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
4. From guess 2:
   - R is present but not in position 1 (since feedback for R is ""-"" meaning wrong position).
   - A is correct in position 2 (so the secret word has A as the second letter).
   - I and S are not in the word (x).

Additionally, we know that R is present in the word but now we know it cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2) or position 2 (from guess 1). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 5 is E).

Also, since A is now fixed at position 2, the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ E

We have two positions to fill: 1 and 3,4? Actually:
- Position 1: unknown, but not C, N, I, S (from previous feedback).
- Position 3: must be filled, and R is a candidate for position 3 or 4.
- Position 4: must be filled.

We also know that the word contains R, and it must be in position 3 or 4.

Therefore, the secret word looks like: _ A [possibly R here] [possibly R or another] E

But note, R is only one letter? Unless it appears twice? But we don't know. So far, we don't have evidence of duplicate letters.

We should consider the possibility of duplicate letters? Since the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates explicitly? Actually, the feedback marks each occurrence. For example, if a letter appears twice, and we guess it once, it might show only that it's missing the second one? But in Wordle-style, each letter is judged individually. So if a letter appears twice and we guess it once in the correct position and once missing, it could be tricky. But in this case, we have guesses with no duplicates so far.

To be safe, we assume no duplicates until evidence suggests otherwise.

Therefore, R appears exactly once, and it must be in position 3 or 4.

Now, for the next guess, we need to:
- Include R in position 3 or 4.
- Avoid C, N, I, S (absent letters).
- Keep position 2 as A and position 5 as E.
- Test new letters for position 1 and the other position (3 or 4) that R is not occupying.

Since R must be in position 3 or 4, we have two cases. We should make a guess that will help distinguish between these cases.

One strategy is to guess a word with R in position 3, and see the feedback. If R isn't at position 3, then it must be at 4.

We can also test a word that includes other common letters not yet eliminated.

Absent letters: C, N, I, S.

Remaining common letters: T, L, O, U, D, M, B, G, etc.

We need a word that fits the pattern: _ A _ _ E and includes R in either position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- If R is in position 3: pattern: _ A R _ E
  - Examples: ""caree""? But C is not allowed. ""baree""? Not common. ""pare""? Only 4 letters. ""parle""? Not common.
  - Better: ""mare"" -> 4 letters. 
  - Valid 5-letter words: ""pares""? But S is not allowed (absent). ""tare""? 4 letters.
  - ""barge"": B, A, R, G, E -> 
    - Position 1: B
    - Position 2: A (fixed)
    - Position 3: R (testing R at position 3)
    - Position 4: G
    - Position 5: E (fixed)
- But we don't know if B and G are in the word? We can test.

Similarly, if R is in position 4: pattern: _ A _ R E
  - Example: ""barre"" -> R repeated? Or ""barye""? Not common. 
  - ""pare""? Too short. ""padre"": P, A, D, R, E -> 
    - Position 1: P
    - Position 2: A
    - Position 3: D
    - Position 4: R
    - Position 5: E

But we need a word that will help us narrow down whether R is in position 3 or 4. We could choose a word that has R at position 4, but also includes new letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily fix R but allows it to be in both possible positions? But that might not be efficient.

Another idea: we can guess a word that has R in position 4, and introduces new letters. Then the feedback will tell us if R is at position 4 or not.

Similarly, if we guess R at position 3, we get feedback.

But we can also design a word that tests letters for position 1 and 3/4 simultaneously.

Since position 3 and 4 are close, let's list possible words:

For pattern _ A _ _ E including R at position 3:
- ""barge"": B, A, R, G, E -> tests B at 1, R at 3, G at 4. Avoids C,N,I,S.
- ""large"": L, A, R, G, E -> same but L at 1.
- ""marge"": M, A, R, G, E -> M at 1.
- ""targe"": T, A, R, G, E -> T at 1.

For pattern _ A _ _ E with R at position 4:
- ""padre"": P, A, D, R, E -> P at 1, D at 3, R at 4.

But if we guess ""barge"" and R turns out to be in position 4, then we might not get useful information about position 4? The feedback would show R as absent in position 3 (- if present elsewhere, or x if not at all? but we know R is present) and G might be absent or present.

Let me simulate:
Case 1: Secret word has R at position 3 (e.g., ""barge""). Then if we guess ""barge"", feedback would be: B(✓) A(✓) R(✓) G(✓) E(✓) -> win.

Case 2: Secret word has R at position 4 (e.g., ""padre""). If we guess ""barge"":
- Position 1: B -> if secret is ""padre"", B is absent -> x.
- Position 2: A -> ✓
- Position 3: R -> but secret has R at position 4, so R is present but not at position 3 -> feedback for R: (-) 
- Position 4: G -> secret has D? so G is absent -> x
- Position 5: E -> ✓
So feedback: B(x) A(✓) R(-) G(x) E(✓) -> which tells us R is not at 3 (so it must be at 4) and B and G are absent.

Similarly, we could get good information.

But if we guess ""padre"":
Case 1: Secret is ""barge"" -> 
  - P: not in word -> x
  - A: ✓
  - D: absent -> x
  - R: not at position 4? in ""barge"", R is at 3, so R is present but at wrong position? Since we guessed R at 4, but it is at 3 -> (-)
  - E: ✓
Feedback: P(x) A(✓) D(x) R(-) E(✓) -> tells us R is present but not at 4, so it must be at 3.

So both types of guesses can work.

But note we also need to consider that we have only 4 guesses left? We used 2, so 4 remaining? We have 6 tries total. But we want efficiency.

Moreover, we want to minimize the number of possibilities.

We can list potential words.

Possible secret words (based on known info):
Pattern: _ A _ _ E
Contains R (in position 3 or 4).
Absent letters: C, N, I, S.

Possible words:
- R in position 3:
  - barge
  - large
  - marge (not common? but valid in word lists)
  - targe
  - wage? But no R -> invalid. 
  - carex? C not allowed.
- Actually, common words: ""barge"", ""large"", ""marge"" (if accepted), but also ""pareu""? Not standard. ""farce""? Has C and not E ending? No, E ending. But ""farce"": F, A, R, C, E -> but C is absent? So invalid.
- Without C: ""barge"", ""large"", ""targe"" (historical? but acceptable in word games).

Also: ""ware"" -> too short.

""carle""? C not allowed.

So perhaps: barge, large, targe. Maybe ""parge""? Not common.

- R in position 4:
  - padre
  - madre
  - cadre? Has C -> invalid.
  - bad? not 5 letters.
  - ""tare"" -> too short.
  - ""dare"" -> too short.
  - ""hare"" -> too short.
  - ""gare""? Not common.
  - ""bare"" -> too short.
  - ""fared"": F, A, R, E, D? No: positions? ""fared"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4? But we need E at 5. ""fared"" is F-A-R-E-D? Then ends with D. But pattern must be _ A _ _ E. So ""fared"" ends with D? No, ""fared"" is F-A-R-E-D? Five letters: 1:F, 2:A, 3:R, 4:E, 5:D? But we need position 5 to be E? So invalid. Similarly, we want words ending with E.

""padre"", ""madre""? But these are considered. Also ""saare""? Not common.

Another word: ""jasey""? Not common, and has S? S is absent.

Wait, ""poire""? But not standard.

Perhaps acceptable words: ""padre"", ""madre"", ""barde"" (but ""barde"": B,A,R,D,E -> so B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, D at 4, E at 5) -> R at position 3? Oh, that would be case of R at 3.

""barde"": positions: 1-B, 2-A, 3-R, 4-D, 5-E -> so R at 3.

Then for R at position 4: ""pare"" too short. ""lares""? L, A, R, E, S? Ends with S? Positions: 1-L? 2-A? 3-R? 4-E? 5-S? Not ending with E? Invalid.

""pares"" but S is absent and not ending E? Also, ""pares"" is P-A-R-E-S, ends with S.

So the only word with R at position 4 and ending with E that I can think of is ""padre"" (and ""madre""). ""cadre"" has C -> invalid.

""hadar"" not ending with E.

Therefore, possible words so far:
- R at 3: barge, large, targe, barde, fared? ""fared"" ends with D? No, let's spell: F-A-R-E-D? So last letter D, not E. So not valid.

Wait, what about ""ware""? No.

""barre"" has two R's? ""barre"": B,A,R,R,E? Then positions: 1-B, 2-A, 3-R, 4-R, 5-E. So R in position 3 and 4? But we only know one R is present? The feedback might mark both.

But let's assume we avoid repeats for now.

Another word: ""carve""? Has C -> invalid.

Perhaps ""garde"" -> G,A,R,D,E -> R at 3? Pattern _ A R _ E.

Yes, but G at 1. ""garde"" is not common? Or accepted.

In word games, ""barde"", ""garde"", etc., might be accepted.

But another common one: ""mare""? Too short.

""share""? But S is absent.

So the list is small: we have ""barge"", ""large"", ""targe"", ""barde"", ""garde"", and for R at 4: ""padre"", ""madre"".

But ""targe"" is a word (a small shield). ""barde"" (to caparison a horse), etc. They should be acceptable.

Moreover, ""parent"" has 6 letters? No, 5-letter words.

Another possibility: ""tarre""? Not common, ends with E? T-A-R-R-E? Then T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, R at 4? Or T-A-R-R-E? So repeated R? But not standard.

To move forward, since the list is small, we can choose a guess that covers multiple possibilities.

For example, if we guess ""barge"", it tests if R is at 3 and the word is ""barge"". If not, then R must be in position 4, and we can try ""padre"" later.

Similarly, we can guess ""padre"" to see if R is at position 4.

But we want to maximize information.

As we saw, guessing a word with R at position 3 will tell us if it's at position 3 or not: if it's ✓ then win, if it's (-) then R is at 4.

Similarly, R at position 4: if ✓ then win, if (-) then at 3.

So both are fine.

But also, we introduce new letters to test.

Since ""barge"" introduces B, R, G? R is present, but B and G are new.

Similarly, ""padre"" introduces P, D.

To cover more letters, we can choose a word that tests letters common to both cases? But different cases have different letters.

Another approach: we can guess a word that doesn't have R in position 3 or 4? But we know R must be in position 3 or 4, so we should place it there. Otherwise, if we don't include R, we lose the chance to determine its position? Also, by including R in a new possible position, we might get information? But the only positions left are 1,3,4? But we know R cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2) or position 2 (from guess 1), so position 1 is also impossible? Earlier I concluded R must be in 3 or 4.

From guess 1: R not in position 2.
From guess 2: R not in position 1.

And the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is A, position 5 is E, position 1 is unknown, so R cannot be at 1 or 2? Then only 3 and 4 left? Yes.

Therefore, we must place R in either 3 or 4.

Thus, for the next guess, we choose a word putting R in position 3, to test that possibility.

We can choose ""large"": L, A, R, G, E? Or ""barge"".

Both are similar. Let’s pick ""large"".

Advantages:
- Uses common letters L and G.
- If the secret word is ""large"", we win.
- If not, then we know R is at position 4 (if feedback shows R at 3 is wrong). Also, we get info about L and G.

Therefore, I will guess ""large"".

But let me write it: guess ""large"".

If we get feedback that R is not at position 3, then the secret word must be like ""padre"" with R at 4.

And we will have tested L and G.

If L or G are present, fine.

So I think it's good.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

Given the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(absent), R(present but wrong position), A(present but wrong position), N(absent), E(correct position).  
  - Key deductions:  
    - E is in position 5 (fixed).  
    - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.  
    - C and N are absent and can be excluded.  
- **Guess 2: RAISE** → Feedback: R(present but wrong position), A(correct position), I(absent), S(absent), E(correct position).  
  - Key deductions:  
    - A is fixed in position 2 (confirmed ✓).  
    - R is present but not in position 1 (new deduction) or position 2 (from Guess 1). Since positions 1 and 2 are invalid for R, R must be in position 3 or 4.  
    - I and S are absent and can be excluded.  
    - Positions known:  
      - Position 2: A  
      - Position 5: E  
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ A _ _ E`  
  - Only positions 1, 3, and 4 are unknown.  
  - R must be in position 3 or 4 (no other options due to feedback).  
  - Absent letters: C, N, I, S. Avoid these in future guesses.  

**Strategy for Guess 3**:  
- **Goal**: Test R in position 3 to determine if it is correct or not. This will narrow R's position:  
  - If R is ✓ in position 3, the secret word is `_ A R _ E`.  
  - If R is (-), the secret word must have R in position 4 (`_ A _ R E`).  
- **Word selection criteria**:  
  - Must end with E (position 5 fixed).  
  - Must have A in position 2.  
  - Incorporate R in position 3 to test its placement.  
  - Avoid absent letters (C, N, I, S).  
  - Introduce new common letters (e.g., L, G) for positions 1 and 4 to maximize information.  
- **Chosen word: LARGE**  
  - Structure: L (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), R (position 3, testing), G (position 4), E (position 5, fixed).  
  - Why LARGE?  
    - Tests R in position 3 directly.  
    - Introduces new letters L and G.  
    - Avoids all absent letters.  
    - If secret word is LARGE, we win. If not, feedback on R (position 3) will confirm if R belongs in position 3 or 4, and feedback on L/G will eliminate letters.  
  - Alternative words considered (e.g., BARGE, TARGE) were less common or used less frequent letters. LARGE is a valid, common word.  

<guess>large</guess>",large,"We are given feedback from two guesses:
- Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
- Guess 2: raise -> R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(✓)

From this, we know:
1. The secret word ends with E (position 5).
2. E is in position 5 (known correct and maintained in both guesses).
3. From guess 1:
   - C and N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
4. From guess 2:
   - R is present but not in position 1 (since feedback for R is ""-"" meaning wrong position).
   - A is correct in position 2 (so the secret word has A as the second letter).
   - I and S are not in the word (x).

Additionally, we know that R is present in the word but now we know it cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2) or position 2 (from guess 1). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4 (since position 5 is E).

Also, since A is now fixed at position 2, the secret word pattern is: _ A _ _ E

We have two positions to fill: 1 and 3,4? Actually:
- Position 1: unknown, but not C, N, I, S (from previous feedback).
- Position 3: must be filled, and R is a candidate for position 3 or 4.
- Position 4: must be filled.

We also know that the word contains R, and it must be in position 3 or 4.

Therefore, the secret word looks like: _ A [possibly R here] [possibly R or another] E

But note, R is only one letter? Unless it appears twice? But we don't know. So far, we don't have evidence of duplicate letters.

We should consider the possibility of duplicate letters? Since the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates explicitly? Actually, the feedback marks each occurrence. For example, if a letter appears twice, and we guess it once, it might show only that it's missing the second one? But in Wordle-style, each letter is judged individually. So if a letter appears twice and we guess it once in the correct position and once missing, it could be tricky. But in this case, we have guesses with no duplicates so far.

To be safe, we assume no duplicates until evidence suggests otherwise.

Therefore, R appears exactly once, and it must be in position 3 or 4.

Now, for the next guess, we need to:
- Include R in position 3 or 4.
- Avoid C, N, I, S (absent letters).
- Keep position 2 as A and position 5 as E.
- Test new letters for position 1 and the other position (3 or 4) that R is not occupying.

Since R must be in position 3 or 4, we have two cases. We should make a guess that will help distinguish between these cases.

One strategy is to guess a word with R in position 3, and see the feedback. If R isn't at position 3, then it must be at 4.

We can also test a word that includes other common letters not yet eliminated.

Absent letters: C, N, I, S.

Remaining common letters: T, L, O, U, D, M, B, G, etc.

We need a word that fits the pattern: _ A _ _ E and includes R in either position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- If R is in position 3: pattern: _ A R _ E
  - Examples: ""caree""? But C is not allowed. ""baree""? Not common. ""pare""? Only 4 letters. ""parle""? Not common.
  - Better: ""mare"" -> 4 letters. 
  - Valid 5-letter words: ""pares""? But S is not allowed (absent). ""tare""? 4 letters.
  - ""barge"": B, A, R, G, E -> 
    - Position 1: B
    - Position 2: A (fixed)
    - Position 3: R (testing R at position 3)
    - Position 4: G
    - Position 5: E (fixed)
- But we don't know if B and G are in the word? We can test.

Similarly, if R is in position 4: pattern: _ A _ R E
  - Example: ""barre"" -> R repeated? Or ""barye""? Not common. 
  - ""pare""? Too short. ""padre"": P, A, D, R, E -> 
    - Position 1: P
    - Position 2: A
    - Position 3: D
    - Position 4: R
    - Position 5: E

But we need a word that will help us narrow down whether R is in position 3 or 4. We could choose a word that has R at position 4, but also includes new letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily fix R but allows it to be in both possible positions? But that might not be efficient.

Another idea: we can guess a word that has R in position 4, and introduces new letters. Then the feedback will tell us if R is at position 4 or not.

Similarly, if we guess R at position 3, we get feedback.

But we can also design a word that tests letters for position 1 and 3/4 simultaneously.

Since position 3 and 4 are close, let's list possible words:

For pattern _ A _ _ E including R at position 3:
- ""barge"": B, A, R, G, E -> tests B at 1, R at 3, G at 4. Avoids C,N,I,S.
- ""large"": L, A, R, G, E -> same but L at 1.
- ""marge"": M, A, R, G, E -> M at 1.
- ""targe"": T, A, R, G, E -> T at 1.

For pattern _ A _ _ E with R at position 4:
- ""padre"": P, A, D, R, E -> P at 1, D at 3, R at 4.

But if we guess ""barge"" and R turns out to be in position 4, then we might not get useful information about position 4? The feedback would show R as absent in position 3 (- if present elsewhere, or x if not at all? but we know R is present) and G might be absent or present.

Let me simulate:
Case 1: Secret word has R at position 3 (e.g., ""barge""). Then if we guess ""barge"", feedback would be: B(✓) A(✓) R(✓) G(✓) E(✓) -> win.

Case 2: Secret word has R at position 4 (e.g., ""padre""). If we guess ""barge"":
- Position 1: B -> if secret is ""padre"", B is absent -> x.
- Position 2: A -> ✓
- Position 3: R -> but secret has R at position 4, so R is present but not at position 3 -> feedback for R: (-) 
- Position 4: G -> secret has D? so G is absent -> x
- Position 5: E -> ✓
So feedback: B(x) A(✓) R(-) G(x) E(✓) -> which tells us R is not at 3 (so it must be at 4) and B and G are absent.

Similarly, we could get good information.

But if we guess ""padre"":
Case 1: Secret is ""barge"" -> 
  - P: not in word -> x
  - A: ✓
  - D: absent -> x
  - R: not at position 4? in ""barge"", R is at 3, so R is present but at wrong position? Since we guessed R at 4, but it is at 3 -> (-)
  - E: ✓
Feedback: P(x) A(✓) D(x) R(-) E(✓) -> tells us R is present but not at 4, so it must be at 3.

So both types of guesses can work.

But note we also need to consider that we have only 4 guesses left? We used 2, so 4 remaining? We have 6 tries total. But we want efficiency.

Moreover, we want to minimize the number of possibilities.

We can list potential words.

Possible secret words (based on known info):
Pattern: _ A _ _ E
Contains R (in position 3 or 4).
Absent letters: C, N, I, S.

Possible words:
- R in position 3:
  - barge
  - large
  - marge (not common? but valid in word lists)
  - targe
  - wage? But no R -> invalid. 
  - carex? C not allowed.
- Actually, common words: ""barge"", ""large"", ""marge"" (if accepted), but also ""pareu""? Not standard. ""farce""? Has C and not E ending? No, E ending. But ""farce"": F, A, R, C, E -> but C is absent? So invalid.
- Without C: ""barge"", ""large"", ""targe"" (historical? but acceptable in word games).

Also: ""ware"" -> too short.

""carle""? C not allowed.

So perhaps: barge, large, targe. Maybe ""parge""? Not common.

- R in position 4:
  - padre
  - madre
  - cadre? Has C -> invalid.
  - bad? not 5 letters.
  - ""tare"" -> too short.
  - ""dare"" -> too short.
  - ""hare"" -> too short.
  - ""gare""? Not common.
  - ""bare"" -> too short.
  - ""fared"": F, A, R, E, D? No: positions? ""fared"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4? But we need E at 5. ""fared"" is F-A-R-E-D? Then ends with D. But pattern must be _ A _ _ E. So ""fared"" ends with D? No, ""fared"" is F-A-R-E-D? Five letters: 1:F, 2:A, 3:R, 4:E, 5:D? But we need position 5 to be E? So invalid. Similarly, we want words ending with E.

""padre"", ""madre""? But these are considered. Also ""saare""? Not common.

Another word: ""jasey""? Not common, and has S? S is absent.

Wait, ""poire""? But not standard.

Perhaps acceptable words: ""padre"", ""madre"", ""barde"" (but ""barde"": B,A,R,D,E -> so B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, D at 4, E at 5) -> R at position 3? Oh, that would be case of R at 3.

""barde"": positions: 1-B, 2-A, 3-R, 4-D, 5-E -> so R at 3.

Then for R at position 4: ""pare"" too short. ""lares""? L, A, R, E, S? Ends with S? Positions: 1-L? 2-A? 3-R? 4-E? 5-S? Not ending with E? Invalid.

""pares"" but S is absent and not ending E? Also, ""pares"" is P-A-R-E-S, ends with S.

So the only word with R at position 4 and ending with E that I can think of is ""padre"" (and ""madre""). ""cadre"" has C -> invalid.

""hadar"" not ending with E.

Therefore, possible words so far:
- R at 3: barge, large, targe, barde, fared? ""fared"" ends with D? No, let's spell: F-A-R-E-D? So last letter D, not E. So not valid.

Wait, what about ""ware""? No.

""barre"" has two R's? ""barre"": B,A,R,R,E? Then positions: 1-B, 2-A, 3-R, 4-R, 5-E. So R in position 3 and 4? But we only know one R is present? The feedback might mark both.

But let's assume we avoid repeats for now.

Another word: ""carve""? Has C -> invalid.

Perhaps ""garde"" -> G,A,R,D,E -> R at 3? Pattern _ A R _ E.

Yes, but G at 1. ""garde"" is not common? Or accepted.

In word games, ""barde"", ""garde"", etc., might be accepted.

But another common one: ""mare""? Too short.

""share""? But S is absent.

So the list is small: we have ""barge"", ""large"", ""targe"", ""barde"", ""garde"", and for R at 4: ""padre"", ""madre"".

But ""targe"" is a word (a small shield). ""barde"" (to caparison a horse), etc. They should be acceptable.

Moreover, ""parent"" has 6 letters? No, 5-letter words.

Another possibility: ""tarre""? Not common, ends with E? T-A-R-R-E? Then T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, R at 4? Or T-A-R-R-E? So repeated R? But not standard.

To move forward, since the list is small, we can choose a guess that covers multiple possibilities.

For example, if we guess ""barge"", it tests if R is at 3 and the word is ""barge"". If not, then R must be in position 4, and we can try ""padre"" later.

Similarly, we can guess ""padre"" to see if R is at position 4.

But we want to maximize information.

As we saw, guessing a word with R at position 3 will tell us if it's at position 3 or not: if it's ✓ then win, if it's (-) then R is at 4.

Similarly, R at position 4: if ✓ then win, if (-) then at 3.

So both are fine.

But also, we introduce new letters to test.

Since ""barge"" introduces B, R, G? R is present, but B and G are new.

Similarly, ""padre"" introduces P, D.

To cover more letters, we can choose a word that tests letters common to both cases? But different cases have different letters.

Another approach: we can guess a word that doesn't have R in position 3 or 4? But we know R must be in position 3 or 4, so we should place it there. Otherwise, if we don't include R, we lose the chance to determine its position? Also, by including R in a new possible position, we might get information? But the only positions left are 1,3,4? But we know R cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2) or position 2 (from guess 1), so position 1 is also impossible? Earlier I concluded R must be in 3 or 4.

From guess 1: R not in position 2.
From guess 2: R not in position 1.

And the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is A, position 5 is E, position 1 is unknown, so R cannot be at 1 or 2? Then only 3 and 4 left? Yes.

Therefore, we must place R in either 3 or 4.

Thus, for the next guess, we choose a word putting R in position 3, to test that possibility.

We can choose ""large"": L, A, R, G, E? Or ""barge"".

Both are similar. Let’s pick ""large"".

Advantages:
- Uses common letters L and G.
- If the secret word is ""large"", we win.
- If not, then we know R is at position 4 (if feedback shows R at 3 is wrong). Also, we get info about L and G.

Therefore, I will guess ""large"".

But let me write it: guess ""large"".

If we get feedback that R is not at position 3, then the secret word must be like ""padre"" with R at 4.

And we will have tested L and G.

If L or G are present, fine.

So I think it's good.### Step-by-Step Reasoning
