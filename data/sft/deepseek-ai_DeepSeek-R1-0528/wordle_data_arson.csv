We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""STARE"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: ✓ -> correct position (so R is the second letter in the secret word)
 A: - -> in the word but wrong position (so A is in the word, but not the third letter)
 N: - -> in the word but wrong position (so N is in the word, but not the fourth letter)
 E: x -> not in the word

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter R in the second position (index 1).
 - The secret word contains A and N, but A is not in position 3 (index 2) and N is not in position 4 (index 3).
 - The secret word does not contain C, E, or (from the absence in feedback) any other letters we haven't guessed.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Has R in the second position.
   - Includes A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively? Actually, the feedback only says that in the word ""crane"", A was in the wrong position (so it can't be at index 2) and N was in the wrong position (so it can't be at index 3). But in the new word, we can put A and N in other positions as long as we respect that they are present.

 Steps:
 1. Recall that the word must have R at index 1 (second letter).

 2. Since A is in the word but not at index 2, and N is in the word but not at index 3, we should try to place A and N in other valid positions.

 3. We also know that C and E are not in the word. Additionally, we must avoid any other letters that were excluded? But from the first guess we only know that C and E are out.

 4. The positions available for A: it cannot be at index 2? Actually, the feedback says that in ""crane"", A was at index 2 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, A is present but not at index 2 (the third position). Similarly, N is present but not at index 3 (fourth position). Therefore, A and N must appear in the word at one of the other positions: 0, 1 (but position 1 is R), 3, or 4? Actually, the positions are:
    position0: first letter
    position1: R (fixed)
    position2: cannot be A (from the - on A)
    position3: cannot be N (from the - on N)
    position4: fifth letter

 So for A: it can be at position0, position3, or position4? But note: the feedback doesn't restrict the same letter from appearing elsewhere? No, typically, if the same letter appeared twice, the feedback would reflect both. But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. In the feedback, we only have one A and one N.

 However, we must consider that if the word has duplicate letters, the feedback might mark the duplicates appropriately. But for now, we'll assume that A and N appear once. So:
   A must be in one of the positions: 0, 3, or 4.
   Similarly, N must be in one of the positions: 0, 2, or 4? Because at position2 and position3: we know position3 cannot be N? Actually, position3 cannot be N because in ""crane"" we had N at position3 and it was marked as wrong position. Also note: position1 is fixed as R, so N cannot be there.

 Therefore, N can be at position0, position2, or position4.

 But we must avoid placing A and N at positions that are fixed? Only position1 is fixed.

 Also, we have two letters we know: R at position1, and A and N are present.

 5. We need to choose a word that fits:
    Pattern: [?, R, ?, ?, ?] 
    Containing A and N, but A not at position2 and N not at position3? Actually, the feedback doesn't say that N cannot be at other positions? It only tells us that in ""crane"", N was at position3 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, N must be at position0, position2, or position4? But note: if the word has N at another position and also at position3, that's possible? However, we don't have any indication of duplicates. Since we only had one N in the guess and it got a -, we can assume N appears at least once but not at position3. Similarly, A appears at least once but not at position2.

 6. Therefore, the word structure is:
    [letter0, R, letter2, letter3, letter4]
    where letter0, letter2, letter3, letter4 are to be chosen.

    Constraints:
    - A must be one of: letter0, letter3, letter4
    - N must be one of: letter0, letter2, letter4

    And we must choose letters that are not C and E.

 7. We should also think about common letters. Since we have two positions to fill with A and N, we can form words that have these properties.

 8. Possible words? Let's think of words that have R in the second position, and contain A and N.

    We can try:
    - Starting with A? A _ R _ _ 
        Then: A must be at position0, so then A and R are at 0 and 1. Then N must be at 2 or 4 (since not at 3). But also, the word must have the other letters.

    Example: ""APRON"" 
        Positions: 
          0: A -> is allowed because it's position0 and we said A can be at 0,3,4? Yes.
          1: R
          2: P
          3: O
          4: N -> N can be at position4? But note: in ""apron"", N is at position4 -> which is allowed because the constraint for N is that it must not be at position3? And indeed it isn't. However, we also have A at position0 and that's okay because it's not at position2? Yes.

        But does ""apron"" have A at the first? Yes. Also, note: we didn't have any constraint about O or P? And we know that C and E are out, but O and P are new.

    However, wait: let me map the word ""apron"":
        a p r o n
        positions: 0->a, 1->p? No, wait, we have the second letter as R? but in ""apron"", the second letter is P, not R. So that doesn't work.

    We need R at the second. So we need words that have R at the second letter.

    Another word: ""FARNS""? But is ""farns"" a word? No.

    Word: ""BARON"":
        B A R O N -> incorrect because the second letter is A, and then R is third? We need second letter to be R.

    How about: ""TARNS""? 
        T A R N S -> but then R is the third letter? We need the second letter to be R.

    So pattern: [?, R, ?, ?, ?]
    Let's try words: 
      ""CRANE"" was first guess -> so we can't use that.

    Now, let me think: 
      ARRAY: A R R A Y -> R is at position1 and also position2. But we have A at position0 and position3? And N? But we need to have N in the word? We don't have any N. So no.

    We must include both A and N.

    Another word: ""DRAIN"" -> 
        D R A I N
        positions: 
          0: D -> ?
          1: R -> good
          2: A -> but wait, we have A at position2 -> that would be the third letter? Our feedback said A cannot be at position2? So that's not allowed.

    Why? Because in the first guess ""crane"", A was at position2 and we got a ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not that position. Now, in the secret word, if it were at position2, then in ""crane"" we would have gotten a ""✓"" for A? No, wait: the feedback is relative to the first guess. The first guess ""crane"" had A at position2 and the feedback said ""-"", meaning that the letter A is in the word but not at that position. Therefore, in the secret word, A cannot be at position2. So in ""DRAIN"", we have A at position2 -> which is exactly the position we cannot put A? So ""drain"" is not valid.

    How about ""TRAIN""?
        T R A I N -> again, A is at position2 -> same problem.

    Then let me try putting A at the end? For example: ""CRUNT""? But not a word.

    Or: ""GRAND"":
        G R A N D -> but A is at position2 -> forbidden.

    So we need to avoid putting A at position2.

    Then where can A be? At 0, 3, or 4.

    Example: ""BRAWN""? 
        B R A W N -> A is at position2 -> again, forbidden? Because that's the third letter? Yes.

    How about ""ARSON"": 
        A R S O N -> 
        A at position0: allowed.
        R at position1: fixed.
        Then N at position4: allowed? 
        Also, we have S, O, and ... 
        Does this contain N? yes, at the end. And A at the start.

        So ""ARSON"": 
          A (position0) -> allowed? yes. 
          R (position1) -> correct.
          Then later: N at position4 -> allowed? because the constraint for N is that it cannot be at position3? And at position4 it is not position3 -> so allowed.

        But what about the other letters? S at position2 and O at position3. We don't have constraints on those? Except that we know C and E are out.

        So ""ARSON"" seems a valid guess? It has A and N? Wait: ""arson"" has letters: A, R, S, O, N -> and N is included? Yes.

        Another candidate: ""GRANA"" -> not a word? But ""grana"" is not a word.

        ""URBAN"": 
          U R B A N -> 
          A at position3 -> allowed? 
          N at position4 -> allowed? 
          And U, B are new.

        So ""URBAN"" is a candidate? And we don't have any duplicates? 

        But which one is more common? 

        We might also consider ""GRAIN"" but that puts A at position2 -> invalid.

    Other options: 
        ""ARNIS"" (a word?) -> not really. 

        ""BRANK"" -> not a word? 

        ""PRANK"": 
          P R A N K -> A at position2 -> invalid? 

        How about ""RANKS""? 
          R A N K S -> but then R is at position0? But we need R at position1. So no.

    Therefore, I think ""ARSON"" or ""URBAN"" are possible.

    But note: we haven't checked what letters we can eliminate. We have only guessed ""crane"" and eliminated C and E.

    Why not try a word that has new vowels? Since we don't have vowels? We have A. But maybe we need to test others? 

    Alternatively, we can try to get more information.

    Considering that we have A and N, and a fixed R at position1, and we know A can't be at position2 and N can't be at position3, let me list common words that fit:

      [A, R, ?, ?, N] -> in this case, A at position0, N at position4. Then the two middle letters. 
        For example: ""ARTON""? -> not valid? 
        ""ARNUL""? -> no.

      [?, R, N, ?, A]: but note, N is at position2 -> which is allowed? Because we only restricted N from being at position3? Yes, but the letter2 position? Then A being at the end -> allowed. For example: ""URNAL""? 

      Or: [N, R, ?, ?, A] -> ""NRAIA""? Not a word.

    Another common word: ""MANOR"": 
        M A N O R -> 
          positions: 0: M, 1: A -> wait, we need R at position1? Here we have A at position1 -> and R at position4. So does not have R at second? 

    Let me spell: M A N O R -> so letter0=M, letter1=A -> but we need R at letter1? So no.

    How about ""WORN""? -> too short.

    Actually, let me think of words with second letter R and that have A and N? 

    After scanning, I find that ""RAVEN"" has R at second? 
        R A V E N -> No, because that would be R at index0? We need index1 to be R.

    Let me adjust: words that have the structure: 
      letter0: any, 
      letter1: R, 
      letter2: any except A? 
      letter3: any except N? 
      letter4: any.

    And include both A and N? 

    Possibilities:
      ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> 
        A is at index3 -> valid? 
        N is at index4 -> valid? 
        So yes.

      ""DRAWL"": no N.

      ""CRAWL"": has C -> eliminated? But we already eliminated C? And no N? 

    However, we eliminated C and E, but U and B are new? 

    Another: ""ARHEN""? Not a word.

    ""BRIAN"": 
        B R I A N -> 
          A at index3 -> valid? 
          N at index4 -> valid? 
          Also, we have I and B.

        So ""BRIAN"" -> is it valid? Brian is a name? Accepted? 

    But we need to guess English words.

    I think ""urban"" and ""arson"" are dictionary words.

    Another: ""ORGAN"": 
        O R G A N -> 
          A at index3 -> valid? 
          N at index4 -> valid? 
          But also, A at index3 is safe? and N at index4 is safe.

    However, note that the first letter O? We don't know if O is in the word? But we are testing.

    So ""organ"", ""urban"", ""arson"", ""brian"", etc.

    Since we want to maximize information, let's choose a word that has new letters? We have already seen: C, R, A, N, E -> so we are avoiding C and E.

    Using: U, B, S, O, G, I, etc.

    Also, note that we might be able to confirm whether our A location is at position0, position3, or position4? 

    Considering that, I think ""arson"" might be a good choice? 
        ARSON: 
          A: at position0 -> if the secret word has A at position0, we'd get ✓ for A? Otherwise, if A is at position3 or 4 in the secret, then we'd see a minus? Similarly, if A isn't at all? But we know A is in the word. 
          Also, note: we have R at position1 which we know is correct -> ✓ for R.
          Then S at position2 -> unknown? 
          O at position3 -> we know N cannot be at position3? But we can put others? 
          N at position4 -> similarly, it might be correct or incorrect? 

    Alternatively, ""urban"" has U, B, A, N. 

    But we don't want to reuse E and C? So both are new.

    However, let's pick ""urban"" because it places A in a different position (position3) and N at the end? 

    But wait: ""urban"" is U R B A N -> 
        positions: 
          0: U -> if U is in the word or not? 
          1: R -> ✓
          2: B -> ?
          3: A -> we know it isn't A? Actually, we know A is in the word, so if the secret word has A at position3? then we'd get ✓. Or if A is at position0? then we'd get a minus? 
        It tests U, B and confirms if A is at position3? 

    Since we know A is not at position2, if it were at position3 or 4, then we'd get feedback.

    Similarly, ""arson"" places A at position0? 

    How about ""ORGAN"": O R G A N -> 
        O: at0
        R: ✓ at1
        G: at2 -> 
        A: at3 -> 
        N: at4

    This tests A at position3 and N at position4? 

    Alternatively, to cover more ground? We can choose a word that tests one more vowel? Like ""organ"" has O? 

    But note: if the secret word doesn't have O and U? Then testing ""organ"" would waste O? 

    Given that we are at the second guess, maybe we should try to reduce the number of possible letters? 

    Considering the constraints, I'll choose ""urban"" as the next guess.

    So guess: ""urban""

    Another reason: ""urban"" does not put A in the first position? which might help? But we don't have information on position0? 

    How about ""BARON""? 
        B A R O N -> 
          second letter is A -> not R? because R would be the third? So invalid because second letter must be R? 

    Therefore, I choose ""urban"".

<guess>urban</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- A and N are in the secret word but not in the positions they appeared in ""crane"" (A not third, N not fourth).

For the second guess, I need a word that:
1. Has R as the second letter.
2. Includes A and N.
3. Avoids placing A at position 2 (third letter) or N at position 3 (fourth letter) based on the first feedback.
4. Excludes C and E.
5. Introduces new letters to gather more information.

Considering these constraints, ""urban"" fits well:
- U (new letter) at position 0.
- R (fixed) at position 1.
- B (new letter) at position 2.
- A at position 3 (allowed since A cannot be third, but this is fourth—position 3).
- N at position 4 (allowed since N cannot be fourth, but this is fifth—position 4).

This guess efficiently tests plausible positions for A and N while using new letters for further elimination.

<guess>urban</guess>",urban,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: ✓ -> correct position (so R is the second letter in the secret word)
 A: - -> in the word but wrong position (so A is in the word, but not the third letter)
 N: - -> in the word but wrong position (so N is in the word, but not the fourth letter)
 E: x -> not in the word

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter R in the second position (index 1).
 - The secret word contains A and N, but A is not in position 3 (index 2) and N is not in position 4 (index 3).
 - The secret word does not contain C, E, or (from the absence in feedback) any other letters we haven't guessed.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Has R in the second position.
   - Includes A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively? Actually, the feedback only says that in the word ""crane"", A was in the wrong position (so it can't be at index 2) and N was in the wrong position (so it can't be at index 3). But in the new word, we can put A and N in other positions as long as we respect that they are present.

 Steps:
 1. Recall that the word must have R at index 1 (second letter).

 2. Since A is in the word but not at index 2, and N is in the word but not at index 3, we should try to place A and N in other valid positions.

 3. We also know that C and E are not in the word. Additionally, we must avoid any other letters that were excluded? But from the first guess we only know that C and E are out.

 4. The positions available for A: it cannot be at index 2? Actually, the feedback says that in ""crane"", A was at index 2 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, A is present but not at index 2 (the third position). Similarly, N is present but not at index 3 (fourth position). Therefore, A and N must appear in the word at one of the other positions: 0, 1 (but position 1 is R), 3, or 4? Actually, the positions are:
    position0: first letter
    position1: R (fixed)
    position2: cannot be A (from the - on A)
    position3: cannot be N (from the - on N)
    position4: fifth letter

 So for A: it can be at position0, position3, or position4? But note: the feedback doesn't restrict the same letter from appearing elsewhere? No, typically, if the same letter appeared twice, the feedback would reflect both. But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. In the feedback, we only have one A and one N.

 However, we must consider that if the word has duplicate letters, the feedback might mark the duplicates appropriately. But for now, we'll assume that A and N appear once. So:
   A must be in one of the positions: 0, 3, or 4.
   Similarly, N must be in one of the positions: 0, 2, or 4? Because at position2 and position3: we know position3 cannot be N? Actually, position3 cannot be N because in ""crane"" we had N at position3 and it was marked as wrong position. Also note: position1 is fixed as R, so N cannot be there.

 Therefore, N can be at position0, position2, or position4.

 But we must avoid placing A and N at positions that are fixed? Only position1 is fixed.

 Also, we have two letters we know: R at position1, and A and N are present.

 5. We need to choose a word that fits:
    Pattern: [?, R, ?, ?, ?] 
    Containing A and N, but A not at position2 and N not at position3? Actually, the feedback doesn't say that N cannot be at other positions? It only tells us that in ""crane"", N was at position3 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, N must be at position0, position2, or position4? But note: if the word has N at another position and also at position3, that's possible? However, we don't have any indication of duplicates. Since we only had one N in the guess and it got a -, we can assume N appears at least once but not at position3. Similarly, A appears at least once but not at position2.

 6. Therefore, the word structure is:
    [letter0, R, letter2, letter3, letter4]
    where letter0, letter2, letter3, letter4 are to be chosen.

    Constraints:
    - A must be one of: letter0, letter3, letter4
    - N must be one of: letter0, letter2, letter4

    And we must choose letters that are not C and E.

 7. We should also think about common letters. Since we have two positions to fill with A and N, we can form words that have these properties.

 8. Possible words? Let's think of words that have R in the second position, and contain A and N.

    We can try:
    - Starting with A? A _ R _ _ 
        Then: A must be at position0, so then A and R are at 0 and 1. Then N must be at 2 or 4 (since not at 3). But also, the word must have the other letters.

    Example: ""APRON"" 
        Positions: 
          0: A -> is allowed because it's position0 and we said A can be at 0,3,4? Yes.
          1: R
          2: P
          3: O
          4: N -> N can be at position4? But note: in ""apron"", N is at position4 -> which is allowed because the constraint for N is that it must not be at position3? And indeed it isn't. However, we also have A at position0 and that's okay because it's not at position2? Yes.

        But does ""apron"" have A at the first? Yes. Also, note: we didn't have any constraint about O or P? And we know that C and E are out, but O and P are new.

    However, wait: let me map the word ""apron"":
        a p r o n
        positions: 0->a, 1->p? No, wait, we have the second letter as R? but in ""apron"", the second letter is P, not R. So that doesn't work.

    We need R at the second. So we need words that have R at the second letter.

    Another word: ""FARNS""? But is ""farns"" a word? No.

    Word: ""BARON"":
        B A R O N -> incorrect because the second letter is A, and then R is third? We need second letter to be R.

    How about: ""TARNS""? 
        T A R N S -> but then R is the third letter? We need the second letter to be R.

    So pattern: [?, R, ?, ?, ?]
    Let's try words: 
      ""CRANE"" was first guess -> so we can't use that.

    Now, let me think: 
      ARRAY: A R R A Y -> R is at position1 and also position2. But we have A at position0 and position3? And N? But we need to have N in the word? We don't have any N. So no.

    We must include both A and N.

    Another word: ""DRAIN"" -> 
        D R A I N
        positions: 
          0: D -> ?
          1: R -> good
          2: A -> but wait, we have A at position2 -> that would be the third letter? Our feedback said A cannot be at position2? So that's not allowed.

    Why? Because in the first guess ""crane"", A was at position2 and we got a ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not that position. Now, in the secret word, if it were at position2, then in ""crane"" we would have gotten a ""✓"" for A? No, wait: the feedback is relative to the first guess. The first guess ""crane"" had A at position2 and the feedback said ""-"", meaning that the letter A is in the word but not at that position. Therefore, in the secret word, A cannot be at position2. So in ""DRAIN"", we have A at position2 -> which is exactly the position we cannot put A? So ""drain"" is not valid.

    How about ""TRAIN""?
        T R A I N -> again, A is at position2 -> same problem.

    Then let me try putting A at the end? For example: ""CRUNT""? But not a word.

    Or: ""GRAND"":
        G R A N D -> but A is at position2 -> forbidden.

    So we need to avoid putting A at position2.

    Then where can A be? At 0, 3, or 4.

    Example: ""BRAWN""? 
        B R A W N -> A is at position2 -> again, forbidden? Because that's the third letter? Yes.

    How about ""ARSON"": 
        A R S O N -> 
        A at position0: allowed.
        R at position1: fixed.
        Then N at position4: allowed? 
        Also, we have S, O, and ... 
        Does this contain N? yes, at the end. And A at the start.

        So ""ARSON"": 
          A (position0) -> allowed? yes. 
          R (position1) -> correct.
          Then later: N at position4 -> allowed? because the constraint for N is that it cannot be at position3? And at position4 it is not position3 -> so allowed.

        But what about the other letters? S at position2 and O at position3. We don't have constraints on those? Except that we know C and E are out.

        So ""ARSON"" seems a valid guess? It has A and N? Wait: ""arson"" has letters: A, R, S, O, N -> and N is included? Yes.

        Another candidate: ""GRANA"" -> not a word? But ""grana"" is not a word.

        ""URBAN"": 
          U R B A N -> 
          A at position3 -> allowed? 
          N at position4 -> allowed? 
          And U, B are new.

        So ""URBAN"" is a candidate? And we don't have any duplicates? 

        But which one is more common? 

        We might also consider ""GRAIN"" but that puts A at position2 -> invalid.

    Other options: 
        ""ARNIS"" (a word?) -> not really. 

        ""BRANK"" -> not a word? 

        ""PRANK"": 
          P R A N K -> A at position2 -> invalid? 

        How about ""RANKS""? 
          R A N K S -> but then R is at position0? But we need R at position1. So no.

    Therefore, I think ""ARSON"" or ""URBAN"" are possible.

    But note: we haven't checked what letters we can eliminate. We have only guessed ""crane"" and eliminated C and E.

    Why not try a word that has new vowels? Since we don't have vowels? We have A. But maybe we need to test others? 

    Alternatively, we can try to get more information.

    Considering that we have A and N, and a fixed R at position1, and we know A can't be at position2 and N can't be at position3, let me list common words that fit:

      [A, R, ?, ?, N] -> in this case, A at position0, N at position4. Then the two middle letters. 
        For example: ""ARTON""? -> not valid? 
        ""ARNUL""? -> no.

      [?, R, N, ?, A]: but note, N is at position2 -> which is allowed? Because we only restricted N from being at position3? Yes, but the letter2 position? Then A being at the end -> allowed. For example: ""URNAL""? 

      Or: [N, R, ?, ?, A] -> ""NRAIA""? Not a word.

    Another common word: ""MANOR"": 
        M A N O R -> 
          positions: 0: M, 1: A -> wait, we need R at position1? Here we have A at position1 -> and R at position4. So does not have R at second? 

    Let me spell: M A N O R -> so letter0=M, letter1=A -> but we need R at letter1? So no.

    How about ""WORN""? -> too short.

    Actually, let me think of words with second letter R and that have A and N? 

    After scanning, I find that ""RAVEN"" has R at second? 
        R A V E N -> No, because that would be R at index0? We need index1 to be R.

    Let me adjust: words that have the structure: 
      letter0: any, 
      letter1: R, 
      letter2: any except A? 
      letter3: any except N? 
      letter4: any.

    And include both A and N? 

    Possibilities:
      ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> 
        A is at index3 -> valid? 
        N is at index4 -> valid? 
        So yes.

      ""DRAWL"": no N.

      ""CRAWL"": has C -> eliminated? But we already eliminated C? And no N? 

    However, we eliminated C and E, but U and B are new? 

    Another: ""ARHEN""? Not a word.

    ""BRIAN"": 
        B R I A N -> 
          A at index3 -> valid? 
          N at index4 -> valid? 
          Also, we have I and B.

        So ""BRIAN"" -> is it valid? Brian is a name? Accepted? 

    But we need to guess English words.

    I think ""urban"" and ""arson"" are dictionary words.

    Another: ""ORGAN"": 
        O R G A N -> 
          A at index3 -> valid? 
          N at index4 -> valid? 
          But also, A at index3 is safe? and N at index4 is safe.

    However, note that the first letter O? We don't know if O is in the word? But we are testing.

    So ""organ"", ""urban"", ""arson"", ""brian"", etc.

    Since we want to maximize information, let's choose a word that has new letters? We have already seen: C, R, A, N, E -> so we are avoiding C and E.

    Using: U, B, S, O, G, I, etc.

    Also, note that we might be able to confirm whether our A location is at position0, position3, or position4? 

    Considering that, I think ""arson"" might be a good choice? 
        ARSON: 
          A: at position0 -> if the secret word has A at position0, we'd get ✓ for A? Otherwise, if A is at position3 or 4 in the secret, then we'd see a minus? Similarly, if A isn't at all? But we know A is in the word. 
          Also, note: we have R at position1 which we know is correct -> ✓ for R.
          Then S at position2 -> unknown? 
          O at position3 -> we know N cannot be at position3? But we can put others? 
          N at position4 -> similarly, it might be correct or incorrect? 

    Alternatively, ""urban"" has U, B, A, N. 

    But we don't want to reuse E and C? So both are new.

    However, let's pick ""urban"" because it places A in a different position (position3) and N at the end? 

    But wait: ""urban"" is U R B A N -> 
        positions: 
          0: U -> if U is in the word or not? 
          1: R -> ✓
          2: B -> ?
          3: A -> we know it isn't A? Actually, we know A is in the word, so if the secret word has A at position3? then we'd get ✓. Or if A is at position0? then we'd get a minus? 
        It tests U, B and confirms if A is at position3? 

    Since we know A is not at position2, if it were at position3 or 4, then we'd get feedback.

    Similarly, ""arson"" places A at position0? 

    How about ""ORGAN"": O R G A N -> 
        O: at0
        R: ✓ at1
        G: at2 -> 
        A: at3 -> 
        N: at4

    This tests A at position3 and N at position4? 

    Alternatively, to cover more ground? We can choose a word that tests one more vowel? Like ""organ"" has O? 

    But note: if the secret word doesn't have O and U? Then testing ""organ"" would waste O? 

    Given that we are at the second guess, maybe we should try to reduce the number of possible letters? 

    Considering the constraints, I'll choose ""urban"" as the next guess.

    So guess: ""urban""

    Another reason: ""urban"" does not put A in the first position? which might help? But we don't have information on position0? 

    How about ""BARON""? 
        B A R O N -> 
          second letter is A -> not R? because R would be the third? So invalid because second letter must be R? 

    Therefore, I choose ""urban"".

<guess>urban</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- A and N are in the secret word but not in the positions they appeared in ""crane"" (A not third, N not fourth).

For the second guess, I need a word that:
1. Has R as the second letter.
2. Includes A and N.
3. Avoids placing A at position 2 (third letter) or N at position 3 (fourth letter) based on the first feedback.
4. Excludes C and E.
5. Introduces new letters to gather more information.

Considering these constraints, ""urban"" fits well:
- U (new letter) at position 0.
- R (fixed) at position 1.
- B (new letter) at position 2.
- A at position 3 (allowed since A cannot be third, but this is fourth—position 3).
- N at position 4 (allowed since N cannot be fourth, but this is fifth—position 4).

This guess efficiently tests plausible positions for A and N while using new letters for further elimination.",Guess 2: urban -> FEEDBACK: U(x) R(✓) B(x) A(-) N(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,arson,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""STARE"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: ✓ -> correct position (so R is the second letter in the secret word)
 A: - -> in the word but wrong position (so A is in the word, but not the third letter)
 N: - -> in the word but wrong position (so N is in the word, but not the fourth letter)
 E: x -> not in the word

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter R in the second position (index 1).
 - The secret word contains A and N, but A is not in position 3 (index 2) and N is not in position 4 (index 3).
 - The secret word does not contain C, E, or (from the absence in feedback) any other letters we haven't guessed.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Has R in the second position.
   - Includes A and N, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively? Actually, the feedback only says that in the word ""crane"", A was in the wrong position (so it can't be at index 2) and N was in the wrong position (so it can't be at index 3). But in the new word, we can put A and N in other positions as long as we respect that they are present.

 Steps:
 1. Recall that the word must have R at index 1 (second letter).

 2. Since A is in the word but not at index 2, and N is in the word but not at index 3, we should try to place A and N in other valid positions.

 3. We also know that C and E are not in the word. Additionally, we must avoid any other letters that were excluded? But from the first guess we only know that C and E are out.

 4. The positions available for A: it cannot be at index 2? Actually, the feedback says that in ""crane"", A was at index 2 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, A is present but not at index 2 (the third position). Similarly, N is present but not at index 3 (fourth position). Therefore, A and N must appear in the word at one of the other positions: 0, 1 (but position 1 is R), 3, or 4? Actually, the positions are:
    position0: first letter
    position1: R (fixed)
    position2: cannot be A (from the - on A)
    position3: cannot be N (from the - on N)
    position4: fifth letter

 So for A: it can be at position0, position3, or position4? But note: the feedback doesn't restrict the same letter from appearing elsewhere? No, typically, if the same letter appeared twice, the feedback would reflect both. But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. In the feedback, we only have one A and one N.

 However, we must consider that if the word has duplicate letters, the feedback might mark the duplicates appropriately. But for now, we'll assume that A and N appear once. So:
   A must be in one of the positions: 0, 3, or 4.
   Similarly, N must be in one of the positions: 0, 2, or 4? Because at position2 and position3: we know position3 cannot be N? Actually, position3 cannot be N because in ""crane"" we had N at position3 and it was marked as wrong position. Also note: position1 is fixed as R, so N cannot be there.

 Therefore, N can be at position0, position2, or position4.

 But we must avoid placing A and N at positions that are fixed? Only position1 is fixed.

 Also, we have two letters we know: R at position1, and A and N are present.

 5. We need to choose a word that fits:
    Pattern: [?, R, ?, ?, ?] 
    Containing A and N, but A not at position2 and N not at position3? Actually, the feedback doesn't say that N cannot be at other positions? It only tells us that in ""crane"", N was at position3 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, N must be at position0, position2, or position4? But note: if the word has N at another position and also at position3, that's possible? However, we don't have any indication of duplicates. Since we only had one N in the guess and it got a -, we can assume N appears at least once but not at position3. Similarly, A appears at least once but not at position2.

 6. Therefore, the word structure is:
    [letter0, R, letter2, letter3, letter4]
    where letter0, letter2, letter3, letter4 are to be chosen.

    Constraints:
    - A must be one of: letter0, letter3, letter4
    - N must be one of: letter0, letter2, letter4

    And we must choose letters that are not C and E.

 7. We should also think about common letters. Since we have two positions to fill with A and N, we can form words that have these properties.

 8. Possible words? Let's think of words that have R in the second position, and contain A and N.

    We can try:
    - Starting with A? A _ R _ _ 
        Then: A must be at position0, so then A and R are at 0 and 1. Then N must be at 2 or 4 (since not at 3). But also, the word must have the other letters.

    Example: ""APRON"" 
        Positions: 
          0: A -> is allowed because it's position0 and we said A can be at 0,3,4? Yes.
          1: R
          2: P
          3: O
          4: N -> N can be at position4? But note: in ""apron"", N is at position4 -> which is allowed because the constraint for N is that it must not be at position3? And indeed it isn't. However, we also have A at position0 and that's okay because it's not at position2? Yes.

        But does ""apron"" have A at the first? Yes. Also, note: we didn't have any constraint about O or P? And we know that C and E are out, but O and P are new.

    However, wait: let me map the word ""apron"":
        a p r o n
        positions: 0->a, 1->p? No, wait, we have the second letter as R? but in ""apron"", the second letter is P, not R. So that doesn't work.

    We need R at the second. So we need words that have R at the second letter.

    Another word: ""FARNS""? But is ""farns"" a word? No.

    Word: ""BARON"":
        B A R O N -> incorrect because the second letter is A, and then R is third? We need second letter to be R.

    How about: ""TARNS""? 
        T A R N S -> but then R is the third letter? We need the second letter to be R.

    So pattern: [?, R, ?, ?, ?]
    Let's try words: 
      ""CRANE"" was first guess -> so we can't use that.

    Now, let me think: 
      ARRAY: A R R A Y -> R is at position1 and also position2. But we have A at position0 and position3? And N? But we need to have N in the word? We don't have any N. So no.

    We must include both A and N.

    Another word: ""DRAIN"" -> 
        D R A I N
        positions: 
          0: D -> ?
          1: R -> good
          2: A -> but wait, we have A at position2 -> that would be the third letter? Our feedback said A cannot be at position2? So that's not allowed.

    Why? Because in the first guess ""crane"", A was at position2 and we got a ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not that position. Now, in the secret word, if it were at position2, then in ""crane"" we would have gotten a ""✓"" for A? No, wait: the feedback is relative to the first guess. The first guess ""crane"" had A at position2 and the feedback said ""-"", meaning that the letter A is in the word but not at that position. Therefore, in the secret word, A cannot be at position2. So in ""DRAIN"", we have A at position2 -> which is exactly the position we cannot put A? So ""drain"" is not valid.

    How about ""TRAIN""?
        T R A I N -> again, A is at position2 -> same problem.

    Then let me try putting A at the end? For example: ""CRUNT""? But not a word.

    Or: ""GRAND"":
        G R A N D -> but A is at position2 -> forbidden.

    So we need to avoid putting A at position2.

    Then where can A be? At 0, 3, or 4.

    Example: ""BRAWN""? 
        B R A W N -> A is at position2 -> again, forbidden? Because that's the third letter? Yes.

    How about ""ARSON"": 
        A R S O N -> 
        A at position0: allowed.
        R at position1: fixed.
        Then N at position4: allowed? 
        Also, we have S, O, and ... 
        Does this contain N? yes, at the end. And A at the start.

        So ""ARSON"": 
          A (position0) -> allowed? yes. 
          R (position1) -> correct.
          Then later: N at position4 -> allowed? because the constraint for N is that it cannot be at position3? And at position4 it is not position3 -> so allowed.

        But what about the other letters? S at position2 and O at position3. We don't have constraints on those? Except that we know C and E are out.

        So ""ARSON"" seems a valid guess? It has A and N? Wait: ""arson"" has letters: A, R, S, O, N -> and N is included? Yes.

        Another candidate: ""GRANA"" -> not a word? But ""grana"" is not a word.

        ""URBAN"": 
          U R B A N -> 
          A at position3 -> allowed? 
          N at position4 -> allowed? 
          And U, B are new.

        So ""URBAN"" is a candidate? And we don't have any duplicates? 

        But which one is more common? 

        We might also consider ""GRAIN"" but that puts A at position2 -> invalid.

    Other options: 
        ""ARNIS"" (a word?) -> not really. 

        ""BRANK"" -> not a word? 

        ""PRANK"": 
          P R A N K -> A at position2 -> invalid? 

        How about ""RANKS""? 
          R A N K S -> but then R is at position0? But we need R at position1. So no.

    Therefore, I think ""ARSON"" or ""URBAN"" are possible.

    But note: we haven't checked what letters we can eliminate. We have only guessed ""crane"" and eliminated C and E.

    Why not try a word that has new vowels? Since we don't have vowels? We have A. But maybe we need to test others? 

    Alternatively, we can try to get more information.

    Considering that we have A and N, and a fixed R at position1, and we know A can't be at position2 and N can't be at position3, let me list common words that fit:

      [A, R, ?, ?, N] -> in this case, A at position0, N at position4. Then the two middle letters. 
        For example: ""ARTON""? -> not valid? 
        ""ARNUL""? -> no.

      [?, R, N, ?, A]: but note, N is at position2 -> which is allowed? Because we only restricted N from being at position3? Yes, but the letter2 position? Then A being at the end -> allowed. For example: ""URNAL""? 

      Or: [N, R, ?, ?, A] -> ""NRAIA""? Not a word.

    Another common word: ""MANOR"": 
        M A N O R -> 
          positions: 0: M, 1: A -> wait, we need R at position1? Here we have A at position1 -> and R at position4. So does not have R at second? 

    Let me spell: M A N O R -> so letter0=M, letter1=A -> but we need R at letter1? So no.

    How about ""WORN""? -> too short.

    Actually, let me think of words with second letter R and that have A and N? 

    After scanning, I find that ""RAVEN"" has R at second? 
        R A V E N -> No, because that would be R at index0? We need index1 to be R.

    Let me adjust: words that have the structure: 
      letter0: any, 
      letter1: R, 
      letter2: any except A? 
      letter3: any except N? 
      letter4: any.

    And include both A and N? 

    Possibilities:
      ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> 
        A is at index3 -> valid? 
        N is at index4 -> valid? 
        So yes.

      ""DRAWL"": no N.

      ""CRAWL"": has C -> eliminated? But we already eliminated C? And no N? 

    However, we eliminated C and E, but U and B are new? 

    Another: ""ARHEN""? Not a word.

    ""BRIAN"": 
        B R I A N -> 
          A at index3 -> valid? 
          N at index4 -> valid? 
          Also, we have I and B.

        So ""BRIAN"" -> is it valid? Brian is a name? Accepted? 

    But we need to guess English words.

    I think ""urban"" and ""arson"" are dictionary words.

    Another: ""ORGAN"": 
        O R G A N -> 
          A at index3 -> valid? 
          N at index4 -> valid? 
          But also, A at index3 is safe? and N at index4 is safe.

    However, note that the first letter O? We don't know if O is in the word? But we are testing.

    So ""organ"", ""urban"", ""arson"", ""brian"", etc.

    Since we want to maximize information, let's choose a word that has new letters? We have already seen: C, R, A, N, E -> so we are avoiding C and E.

    Using: U, B, S, O, G, I, etc.

    Also, note that we might be able to confirm whether our A location is at position0, position3, or position4? 

    Considering that, I think ""arson"" might be a good choice? 
        ARSON: 
          A: at position0 -> if the secret word has A at position0, we'd get ✓ for A? Otherwise, if A is at position3 or 4 in the secret, then we'd see a minus? Similarly, if A isn't at all? But we know A is in the word. 
          Also, note: we have R at position1 which we know is correct -> ✓ for R.
          Then S at position2 -> unknown? 
          O at position3 -> we know N cannot be at position3? But we can put others? 
          N at position4 -> similarly, it might be correct or incorrect? 

    Alternatively, ""urban"" has U, B, A, N. 

    But we don't want to reuse E and C? So both are new.

    However, let's pick ""urban"" because it places A in a different position (position3) and N at the end? 

    But wait: ""urban"" is U R B A N -> 
        positions: 
          0: U -> if U is in the word or not? 
          1: R -> ✓
          2: B -> ?
          3: A -> we know it isn't A? Actually, we know A is in the word, so if the secret word has A at position3? then we'd get ✓. Or if A is at position0? then we'd get a minus? 
        It tests U, B and confirms if A is at position3? 

    Since we know A is not at position2, if it were at position3 or 4, then we'd get feedback.

    Similarly, ""arson"" places A at position0? 

    How about ""ORGAN"": O R G A N -> 
        O: at0
        R: ✓ at1
        G: at2 -> 
        A: at3 -> 
        N: at4

    This tests A at position3 and N at position4? 

    Alternatively, to cover more ground? We can choose a word that tests one more vowel? Like ""organ"" has O? 

    But note: if the secret word doesn't have O and U? Then testing ""organ"" would waste O? 

    Given that we are at the second guess, maybe we should try to reduce the number of possible letters? 

    Considering the constraints, I'll choose ""urban"" as the next guess.

    So guess: ""urban""

    Another reason: ""urban"" does not put A in the first position? which might help? But we don't have information on position0? 

    How about ""BARON""? 
        B A R O N -> 
          second letter is A -> not R? because R would be the third? So invalid because second letter must be R? 

    Therefore, I choose ""urban"".

<guess>urban</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and E are not in the secret word.
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- A and N are in the secret word but not in the positions they appeared in ""crane"" (A not third, N not fourth).

For the second guess, I need a word that:
1. Has R as the second letter.
2. Includes A and N.
3. Avoids placing A at position 2 (third letter) or N at position 3 (fourth letter) based on the first feedback.
4. Excludes C and E.
5. Introduces new letters to gather more information.

Considering these constraints, ""urban"" fits well:
- U (new letter) at position 0.
- R (fixed) at position 1.
- B (new letter) at position 2.
- A at position 3 (allowed since A cannot be third, but this is fourth—position 3).
- N at position 4 (allowed since N cannot be fourth, but this is fifth—position 4).

This guess efficiently tests plausible positions for A and N while using new letters for further elimination.

Actually, the feedback only says that in the word ""crane"", A was in the wrong position (so it can\'t be at index 2) and N was in the wrong position (so it can\'t be at index 3). But in the new word, we can put A and N in other positions as long as we respect that they are present.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Recall that the word must have R at index 1 (second letter).\n\n 2. Since A is in the word but not at index 2, and N is in the word but not at index 3, we should try to place A and N in other valid positions.\n\n 3. We also know that C and E are not in the word. Additionally, we must avoid any other letters that were excluded? But from the first guess we only know that C and E are out.\n\n 4. The positions available for A: it cannot be at index 2? Actually, the feedback says that in ""crane"", A was at index 2 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, A is present but not at index 2 (the third position). Similarly, N is present but not at index 3 (fourth position). Therefore, A and N must appear in the word at one of the other positions: 0, 1 (but position 1 is R), 3, or 4? Actually, the positions are:\n    position0: first letter\n    position1: R (fixed)\n    position2: cannot be A (from the - on A)\n    position3: cannot be N (from the - on N)\n    position4: fifth letter\n\n So for A: it can be at position0, position3, or position4? But note: the feedback doesn\'t restrict the same letter from appearing elsewhere? No, typically, if the same letter appeared twice, the feedback would reflect both. But we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. In the feedback, we only have one A and one N.\n\n However, we must consider that if the word has duplicate letters, the feedback might mark the duplicates appropriately. But for now, we\'ll assume that A and N appear once. So:\n   A must be in one of the positions: 0, 3, or 4.\n   Similarly, N must be in one of the positions: 0, 2, or 4? Because at position2 and position3: we know position3 cannot be N? Actually, position3 cannot be N because in ""crane"" we had N at position3 and it was marked as wrong position. Also note: position1 is fixed as R, so N cannot be there.\n\n Therefore, N can be at position0, position2, or position4.\n\n But we must avoid placing A and N at positions that are fixed? Only position1 is fixed.\n\n Also, we have two letters we know: R at position1, and A and N are present.\n\n 5. We need to choose a word that fits:\n    Pattern: [?, R, ?, ?, ?] \n    Containing A and N, but A not at position2 and N not at position3? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t say that N cannot be at other positions? It only tells us that in ""crane"", N was at position3 and that was wrong. So in the secret word, N must be at position0, position2, or position4? But note: if the word has N at another position and also at position3, that\'s possible? However, we don\'t have any indication of duplicates. Since we only had one N in the guess and it got a -, we can assume N appears at least once but not at position3. Similarly, A appears at least once but not at position2.\n\n 6. Therefore, the word structure is:\n    [letter0, R, letter2, letter3, letter4]\n    where letter0, letter2, letter3, letter4 are to be chosen.\n\n    Constraints:\n    - A must be one of: letter0, letter3, letter4\n    - N must be one of: letter0, letter2, letter4\n\n    And we must choose letters that are not C and E.\n\n 7. We should also think about common letters. Since we have two positions to fill with A and N, we can form words that have these properties.\n\n 8. Possible words? Let\'s think of words that have R in the second position, and contain A and N.\n\n    We can try:\n    - Starting with A? A _ R _ _ \n        Then: A must be at position0, so then A and R are at 0 and 1. Then N must be at 2 or 4 (since not at 3). But also, the word must have the other letters.\n\n    Example: ""APRON"" \n        Positions: \n          0: A -> is allowed because it\'s position0 and we said A can be at 0,3,4? Yes.\n          1: R\n          2: P\n          3: O\n          4: N -> N can be at position4? But note: in ""apron"", N is at position4 -> which is allowed because the constraint for N is that it must not be at position3? And indeed it isn\'t. However, we also have A at position0 and that\'s okay because it\'s not at position2? Yes.\n\n        But does ""apron"" have A at the first? Yes. Also, note: we didn\'t have any constraint about O or P? And we know that C and E are out, but O and P are new.\n\n    However, wait: let me map the word ""apron"":\n        a p r o n\n        positions: 0->a, 1->p? No, wait, we have the second letter as R? but in ""apron"", the second letter is P, not R. So that doesn\'t work.\n\n    We need R at the second. So we need words that have R at the second letter.\n\n    Another word: ""FARNS""? But is ""farns"" a word? No.\n\n    Word: ""BARON"":\n        B A R O N -> incorrect because the second letter is A, and then R is third? We need second letter to be R.\n\n    How about: ""TARNS""? \n        T A R N S -> but then R is the third letter? We need the second letter to be R.\n\n    So pattern: [?, R, ?, ?, ?]\n    Let\'s try words: \n      ""CRANE"" was first guess -> so we can\'t use that.\n\n    Now, let me think: \n      ARRAY: A R R A Y -> R is at position1 and also position2. But we have A at position0 and position3? And N? But we need to have N in the word? We don\'t have any N. So no.\n\n    We must include both A and N.\n\n    Another word: ""DRAIN"" -> \n        D R A I N\n        positions: \n          0: D -> ?\n          1: R -> good\n          2: A -> but wait, we have A at position2 -> that would be the third letter? Our feedback said A cannot be at position2? So that\'s not allowed.\n\n    Why? Because in the first guess ""crane"", A was at position2 and we got a ""-"", meaning it\'s in the word but not that position. Now, in the secret word, if it were at position2, then in ""crane"" we would have gotten a ""✓"" for A? No, wait: the feedback is relative to the first guess. The first guess ""crane"" had A at position2 and the feedback said ""-"", meaning that the letter A is in the word but not at that position. Therefore, in the secret word, A cannot be at position2. So in ""DRAIN"", we have A at position2 -> which is exactly the position we cannot put A? So ""drain"" is not valid.\n\n    How about ""TRAIN""?\n        T R A I N -> again, A is at position2 -> same problem.\n\n    Then let me try putting A at the end? For example: ""CRUNT""? But not a word.\n\n    Or: ""GRAND"":\n        G R A N D -> but A is at position2 -> forbidden.\n\n    So we need to avoid putting A at position2.\n\n    Then where can A be? At 0, 3, or 4.\n\n    Example: ""BRAWN""? \n        B R A W N -> A is at position2 -> again, forbidden? Because that\'s the third letter? Yes.\n\n    How about ""ARSON"": \n        A R S O N -> \n        A at position0: allowed.\n        R at position1: fixed.\n        Then N at position4: allowed? \n        Also, we have S, O, and ... \n        Does this contain N? yes, at the end. And A at the start.\n\n        So ""ARSON"": \n          A (position0) -> allowed? yes. \n          R (position1) -> correct.\n          Then later: N at position4 -> allowed? because the constraint for N is that it cannot be at position3? And at position4 it is not position3 -> so allowed.\n\n        But what about the other letters? S at position2 and O at position3. We don\'t have constraints on those? Except that we know C and E are out.\n\n        So ""ARSON"" seems a valid guess? It has A and N? Wait: ""arson"" has letters: A, R, S, O, N -> and N is included? Yes.\n\n        Another candidate: ""GRANA"" -> not a word? But ""grana"" is not a word.\n\n        ""URBAN"": \n          U R B A N -> \n          A at position3 -> allowed? \n          N at position4 -> allowed? \n          And U, B are new.\n\n        So ""URBAN"" is a candidate? And we don\'t have any duplicates? \n\n        But which one is more common? \n\n        We might also consider ""GRAIN"" but that puts A at position2 -> invalid.\n\n    Other options: \n        ""ARNIS"" (a word?) -> not really. \n\n        ""BRANK"" -> not a word? \n\n        ""PRANK"": \n          P R A N K -> A at position2 -> invalid? \n\n        How about ""RANKS""? \n          R A N K S -> but then R is at position0? But we need R at position1. So no.\n\n    Therefore, I think ""ARSON"" or ""URBAN"" are possible.\n\n    But note: we haven\'t checked what letters we can eliminate. We have only guessed ""crane"" and eliminated C and E.\n\n    Why not try a word that has new vowels? Since we don\'t have vowels? We have A. But maybe we need to test others? \n\n    Alternatively, we can try to get more information.\n\n    Considering that we have A and N, and a fixed R at position1, and we know A can\'t be at position2 and N can\'t be at position3, let me list common words that fit:\n\n      [A, R, ?, ?, N] -> in this case, A at position0, N at position4. Then the two middle letters. \n        For example: ""ARTON""? -> not valid? \n        ""ARNUL""? -> no.\n\n      [?, R, N, ?, A]: but note, N is at position2 -> which is allowed? Because we only restricted N from being at position3? Yes, but the letter2 position? Then A being at the end -> allowed. For example: ""URNAL""? \n\n      Or: [N, R, ?, ?, A] -> ""NRAIA""? Not a word.\n\n    Another common word: ""MANOR"": \n        M A N O R -> \n          positions: 0: M, 1: A -> wait, we need R at position1? Here we have A at position1 -> and R at position4. So does not have R at second? \n\n    Let me spell: M A N O R -> so letter0=M, letter1=A -> but we need R at letter1? So no.\n\n    How about ""WORN""? -> too short.\n\n    Actually, let me think of words with second letter R and that have A and N? \n\n    After scanning, I find that ""RAVEN"" has R at second? \n        R A V E N -> No, because that would be R at index0? We need index1 to be R.\n\n    Let me adjust: words that have the structure: \n      letter0: any, \n      letter1: R, \n      letter2: any except A? \n      letter3: any except N? \n      letter4: any.\n\n    And include both A and N? \n\n    Possibilities:\n      ""URBAN"": U R B A N -> \n        A is at index3 -> valid? \n        N is at index4 -> valid? \n        So yes.\n\n      ""DRAWL"": no N.\n\n      ""CRAWL"": has C -> eliminated? But we already eliminated C? And no N? \n\n    However, we eliminated C and E, but U and B are new? \n\n    Another: ""ARHEN""? Not a word.\n\n    ""BRIAN"": \n        B R I A N -> \n          A at index3 -> valid? \n          N at index4 -> valid? \n          Also, we have I and B.\n\n        So ""BRIAN"" -> is it valid? Brian is a name? Accepted? \n\n    But we need to guess English words.\n\n    I think ""urban"" and ""arson"" are dictionary words.\n\n    Another: ""ORGAN"": \n        O R G A N -> \n          A at index3 -> valid? \n          N at index4 -> valid? \n          But also, A at index3 is safe? and N at index4 is safe.\n\n    However, note that the first letter O? We don\'t know if O is in the word? But we are testing.\n\n    So ""organ"", ""urban"", ""arson"", ""brian"", etc.\n\n    Since we want to maximize information, let\'s choose a word that has new letters?

Actually, we know A is in the word, so if the secret word has A at position3? then we\'d get ✓. Or if A is at position0? then we\'d get a minus? \n        It tests U, B and confirms if A is at position3? \n\n    Since we know A is not at position2, if it were at position3 or 4, then we\'d get feedback.\n\n    Similarly, ""arson"" places A at position0? \n\n    How about ""ORGAN"": O R G A N -> \n        O: at0\n        R: ✓ at1\n        G: at2 -> \n        A: at3 -> \n        N: at4\n\n    This tests A at position3 and N at position4? \n\n    Alternatively, to cover more ground? We can choose a word that tests one more vowel? Like ""organ"" has O? \n\n    But note: if the secret word doesn\'t have O and U? Then testing ""organ"" would waste O? \n\n    Given that we are at the second guess, maybe we should try to reduce the number of possible letters? \n\n    Considering the constraints, I\'ll choose ""urban"" as the next guess.\n\n    So guess: ""urban""\n\n    Another reason: ""urban"" does not put A in the first position? which might help?

We are given feedback from two guesses:
1. First guess ""crane"": 
   C: x -> not in the word
   R: ✓ -> correct position (so the second letter is R)
   A: - -> in the word but wrong position (so A is not at position 2, the third letter)
   N: - -> in the word but wrong position (so N is not at position 3, the fourth letter)
   E: x -> not in the word

2. Second guess ""urban"":
   U -> x -> not in the word
   R -> ✓ -> already known to be in position 2, so still correct
   B -> x -> not in the word
   A -> - -> in the word but wrong position; since this guess placed A at position 3 (fourth letter), we now know that A is in the word but not at position 3 (fourth letter) either
   N: ✓ -> correct position! So the last letter is N

So now we know for sure:
- The secret word ends with N (fifth letter is N)
- The second letter is R (position 1)
- A is in the word, but it was:
   - Not at position 2 (from the first guess: when we put it at index 2 of ""crane"")
   - Not at position 3 (from the second guess: when we put it at index 3 of ""urban"")
- We also know the secret word has A in some position, so the only remaining positions for A are position 0 (first letter) or position 4? But wait: positions are:
   Position 0: first letter
   Position 1: R (fixed)
   Position 2: cannot be A (from first guess)
   Position 3: cannot be A (from second guess)
   Position 4: N (fixed) -> so A must be at either position 0 or ... position 4? But position 4 is taken by N. Therefore, A must be at position 0? 

But wait: can A be at position 4? No, because position 4 is N? So the only possibility left for A is position 0 (first letter). Therefore, we deduce that the first letter must be A.

Additionally, we have eliminated:
- C, E (from first guess)
- U, B (from second guess)

And we know R and N are fixed at positions 1 and 4.

Therefore, the word so far is: A ? R ? N

We need to fill the middle two positions (position 2 and 3). And we know:
  At position 2: We don't know, except that it cannot be A (but A is already placed at 0, so not here) and the letter must not be among the eliminated ones (C, E, U, B).
  At position 3: Similarly, must not be A? But also we know from the first guess that N is in the word but cannot be at position 3? Wait, we now know N is fixed at position 4? So the constraint on N at position 3 from the first guess is satisfied? And position 3 is unknown.

However, note that in the first guess, ""crane"" had N at position 3? and that was marked wrong position? Since in the secret word, N is at position 4? So that's consistent.

Therefore, we are looking for a word: A ? R ? N

We need to fill the two unknowns: position 2 and position 3.

Now, what are the constraints? 
  We know the word doesn't contain C, E, U, B? And we must use only English letters and form a valid word.

Let me think of common words that fit: A _ R _ N

Possibilities:
  ""ACORN"": has C? eliminated? so no? because C is not allowed? Also, first letter A, second R? Wait: A C O R N -> 
      positions: 0:A, 1:C -> but C is not allowed? and we know the secret word second letter is R? So actually: 
      A would be at 0, then R at 1? But wait: the word must have R at position 1? In ""acorn"": 
          position0: A, position1: C -> not R? So we require the second letter to be R? So the structure is: A, R at second? 
          So ""acorn"" would be A C O R N -> which has R at position 3? Not at 1? So doesn't fit.

  Correct pattern: letter at index1 must be R? and index4 must be N? So in ""acorn"", R is at index3? Not at 1? So it doesn't satisfy.

  Now, words that have R at the second position and N at the fifth? And first letter A? 
      So: A R ? ? N

  But note: the second letter is R? so the word is: 
      position0: A (if we deduce correctly? we think A must be at 0)
      position 1: R
      position 2: unknown
      position 3: unknown
      position 4: N

  So: A R ? ? N

  Example: ""ARTSN""? Not a word.

  ""AREEN""? Not valid? And has E? eliminated.

  ""ARMYN""? Not a word.

  ""ARKEN""? Not common.

  ""ARSON"": 
      Let me see: A R S O N -> 
          position0: A -> we are testing? 
          position1: R -> correct? 
          position2: S
          position3: O
          position4: N -> correct? 
      Is ""arson"" a word? Yes.

  But we already used ""arson""? No, in the previous guesses we guessed ""urban"", not ""arson""? 

  Also, we need to test if S and O are allowed? We haven't tested S or O? And they are not eliminated? 

  So ""arson"" seems a candidate? But wait: we have deduced that A must be at position0? And the second guess ""urban"" placed A at position3? and got '-', which tells us that A is not at position3, so the only position left is position0? Therefore, A must be at position0. So the word starts with A? and ends with N? 

  Therefore, the word must be of the form: A R ? ? N

  Now, let me check ""arson"": A R S O N. We haven't guessed ""arson"" yet? So we can guess it? 

  How about ""ARGON""? 
      A R G O N -> same structure? valid? But it has G and O? 
      Is it a word? Yes? 

  Also, ""ADORN"": 
      A D O R N -> but then the second letter would be D? and R would be at position3? Not at position1? So incorrect pattern? 

  We require: letter at index1 is R? So: 
      A R _ _ N

  Valid words: 
    ""ARMEN"": not a common word? 
    ""ARISN"": no? 

  Actually: 
      ""ARSON"" (as said) 
      ""ARHEN"" -> no? 
      ""ARVAN"" -> not really? 
      ""ARTAN"" -> no? 

  Another common: ""AROON""? Not common? 
     ""AROON"" is a word? Maybe? But we have two O's? 

  How about ""AGAIN""? 
      A G A I N -> 
          second letter: G? Not R? -> doesn't fit.

  So the most common words of this pattern: 
      ""ARSON""
      ""ARGON"" -> a word? yes? 
      ""AYRON""? not? 

  Also: ""ABRIN""? not common? 

  But we haven't eliminated S, O, G? 

  How about ""APRON""? 
      A P R O N -> 
          second letter: P? Not R? -> so incorrect? 

      Wait: the word is spelled: 
          A->0, P->1, R->2 ... so it doesn't have R at position1? 

      Correction: We require position1 to be R? So the word must have: 
          letters: 
            0: A? 
            1: R? 
            2: ? 
            3: ? 
            4: N

      So ""APRON"" spelled: A P R O N -> 
          letter0: A 
          letter1: P (so not R? but R is at letter2) -> so it doesn't satisfy? 

  Therefore, I can only think of ""ARSON"", ""ARGON"", and maybe ""AVIAN""? 
      ""AVIAN"": A V I A N -> 
          second letter: V? Not R? -> no? 

  What about ""AERON""? but E is eliminated? 

  So we are left with ""ARSON"" and ""ARGON"".

  Now, we want to guess one? 

  We know from the first guess that ""crane"" had N at position3? and that was wrong? But now we have N at the end? so position3 at that time was not the same? 

  Also, we have two possibilities? 

  Let me recall: in the second guess ""urban"", we got:
      U: x (eliminated)
      B: x (eliminated)
      A: - -> so A is in the word but not at position3? which we know, so A must be at position0? Now, does ""arg0n"" have A at position0? Both ""arson"" and ""argon"" have A at position0? So they fit that.

  The difference between them is the third and fourth letters.

  We can try ""arson"" to test for S and O? 

  But note: another approach? We have two unknowns? So we need to guess one? 

  Also, we have only used 2 guesses? So we have 4 left? So we can try? 

  However, note: if we guess ""arson"", then we might win? Or eliminate? 

  Given that, I'll go with ""arson"" because it has common letters? 

  But we must ensure we haven't eliminated any letters? 

  Alternatively, we can think: from the letters we have not tested? We haven't tested S and O? So ""arson"" tests them? 

  If we guess ""arson"": 
      If correct? we get all ✓.
      Otherwise, we get feedback? 

  Another possibility: maybe the secret word is ""apran"" but not a word? 

  Considering common words? ""ARSON"" seems more common? 

  But let me check if there are other words? 

  ""ARMEN"" is a word? Armenian? But not 5-letter? 

  ""AVAIL""? Doesn't fit pattern? 

  Actually, ""ARRAN""? not common? 

  So I think ""arson"" or ""argon"" are our best bets? 

  How about ""AXION""? 
      A X I O N -> 
        position1: X? Not R? -> no? 

  Therefore, I'll go with ""arson"" as the next guess? 

  But note: we haven't proved that A must be at position0? Because position4 is taken by N? And the positions that cannot hold A are 2 and 3? and we also have position1 taken by R? and position4 by N? So indeed, the only position for A is position0? So there is no other option? 

  Then we are certain the word starts with A and ends with N? and has R at position1? So the word must be A R _ _ N? 

  Therefore, I choose ""arson"" to test? 

  But also, ""argon"" is a gas? 

  And we haven't eliminated S, O or G? 

  So let me pick ""argon""? 

  Actually, let me see: we can choose one? 

  Since we have two possibilities? To get the most information? 

  But note: if we guess a word that has common letters? 

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that hasn't appeared? 

  However, after gathering more? I'll pick ""arson"".

  So guess: ""arson""

  However, let me double-check the feedback: 
      First guess: crane -> R✓ A- N- 
      Second guess: urban -> R✓ (again) A- N✓? 

      And deduced A must be at position0? 

      So if we guess ""arson"": 
          A: we expect ✓? because at position0? 
          R: ✓ at position1? 
          S: ? 
          O: ? 
          N: ✓? 

      Alternatively, if the word is ""argon"", we'd guess differently? 

  But we don't know? So we have to pick one? 

  Since ""arson"" is in the candidate set? I'll go with that.

  But wait: in the first guess ""crane"", we had an 'A' and it showed up as '-'? meaning that A was not at position2? but at position0 in the secret word? then in ""crane"", at position0 we have C? and at position2 we had A? So no overlap? 

  And now we are guessing A at position0? which was not tested? 

  So let's do ""arson"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from both guesses:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**
   - R is confirmed at position 1 (second letter).
   - A is in the word but NOT at position 2 (third letter).
   - N is in the word but NOT at position 3 (fourth letter).
   - C and E are eliminated.

2. **Guess 2: ""urban""**
   - R is confirmed again at position 1 (second letter).
   - N is confirmed at position 4 (fifth letter) → **secret word ends with N**.
   - A is in the word but NOT at position 3 (fourth letter).
   - U and B are eliminated.

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**: 
  - Position 1: R
  - Position 4: N
- **A constraints**: 
  - Cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""urban"").
  - With positions 1 (R) and 4 (N) fixed, A must be at position 0 (first letter).  
  → **Secret word starts with A**.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, E, U, B.
- **Unfilled positions**: 
  - Position 2 (third letter): Unknown, cannot be A.
  - Position 3 (fourth letter): Unknown, cannot be A and not N (as N is fixed at position 4).

### Structure:
The secret word is: **A R ? ? N**  
We need a valid English word matching this pattern.

### Possible Words:
- **ARSON**: A R S O N (valid word).
- **ARGON**: A R G O N (valid but less common).
- Others like ""ARXEN"" or ""ARWIN"" are invalid/non-existent.

### Strategy:
Choose **ARSON** to test common letters (S and O) and resolve efficiently:
- Position 0: A (expected ✓ if correct).
- Position 1: R (✓).
- Position 2: S (tests new letter).
- Position 3: O (tests new letter).
- Position 4: N (✓).

This maximizes information while adhering to the constraints. If incorrect, feedback will clarify the remaining letters.

1. First guess ""crane"": 
   C: x -> not in the word
   R: ✓ -> correct position (so the second letter is R)
   A: - -> in the word but wrong position (so A is not at position 2, the third letter)

But wait: can A be at position 4? No, because position 4 is N? So the only possibility left for A is position 0 (first letter). Therefore, we deduce that the first letter must be A.

Additionally, we have eliminated:
- C, E (from first guess)
- U, B (from second guess)

And we know R and N are fixed at positions 1 and 4.

Therefore, the word so far is: A ? R ? N

We need to fill the middle two positions (position 2 and 3). And we know:
  At position 2: We don't know, except that it cannot be A (but A is already placed at 0, so not here) and the letter must not be among the eliminated ones (C, E, U, B).

Therefore, we are looking for a word: A ? R ? N

We need to fill the two unknowns: position 2 and position 3.

Now, what are the constraints? 
  We know the word doesn't contain C, E, U, B? And we must use only English letters and form a valid word.

Let me think of common words that fit: A _ R _ N

Possibilities:
  ""ACORN"": has C? eliminated? so no? because C is not allowed? Also, first letter A, second R? Wait: A C O R N -> 
      positions: 0:A, 1:C -> but C is not allowed? and we know the secret word second letter is R? So actually: 
      A would be at 0, then R at 1? But wait: the word must have R at position 1? In ""acorn"": 
          position0: A, position1: C -> not R? So we require the second letter to be R? So the structure is: A, R at second? 
          So ""acorn"" would be A C O R N -> which has R at position 3? Not at 1? So doesn't fit.

  Correct pattern: letter at index1 must be R? and index4 must be N? So in ""acorn"", R is at index3? Not at 1? So it doesn't satisfy.

  Now, words that have R at the second position and N at the fifth? And first letter A? 
      So: A R ? ? N

  But note: the second letter is R? so the word is: 
      position0: A (if we deduce correctly? we think A must be at 0)
      position 1: R
      position 2: unknown
      position 3: unknown
      position 4: N

  So: A R ? ? N

  Example: ""ARTSN""? Not a word.

  ""AREEN""? Not valid? And has E? eliminated.

  ""ARMYN""? Not a word.

  ""ARKEN""? Not common.

  ""ARSON"": 
      Let me see: A R S O N -> 
          position0: A -> we are testing? 
          position1: R -> correct? 
          position2: S
          position3: O
          position4: N -> correct? 
      Is ""arson"" a word? Yes.

  But we already used ""arson""? No, in the previous guesses we guessed ""urban"", not ""arson""?

  So ""arson"" seems a candidate? But wait: we have deduced that A must be at position0? And the second guess ""urban"" placed A at position3? and got '-', which tells us that A is not at position3, so the only position left is position0? Therefore, A must be at position0.

  Now, let me check ""arson"": A R S O N. We haven't guessed ""arson"" yet? So we can guess it? 

  How about ""ARGON""? 
      A R G O N -> same structure? valid? But it has G and O? 
      Is it a word? Yes? 

  Also, ""ADORN"": 
      A D O R N -> but then the second letter would be D? and R would be at position3? Not at position1? So incorrect pattern? 

  We require: letter at index1 is R? So: 
      A R _ _ N

  Valid words: 
    ""ARMEN"": not a common word?

  So the most common words of this pattern: 
      ""ARSON""
      ""ARGON"" -> a word? yes? 
      ""AYRON""? not? 

  Also: ""ABRIN""? not common? 

  But we haven't eliminated S, O, G? 

  How about ""APRON""? 
      A P R O N -> 
          second letter: P? Not R? -> so incorrect? 

      Wait: the word is spelled: 
          A->0, P->1, R->2 ... so it doesn't have R at position1? 

      Correction: We require position1 to be R? So the word must have: 
          letters: 
            0: A? 
            1: R? 
            2: ? 
            3: ? 
            4: N

      So ""APRON"" spelled: A P R O N -> 
          letter0: A 
          letter1: P (so not R? but R is at letter2) -> so it doesn't satisfy? 

  Therefore, I can only think of ""ARSON"", ""ARGON"", and maybe ""AVIAN""? 
      ""AVIAN"": A V I A N ->

  Alternatively, we can think: from the letters we have not tested? We haven't tested S and O? So ""arson"" tests them? 

  If we guess ""arson"": 
      If correct? we get all ✓.
      Otherwise, we get feedback? 

  Another possibility: maybe the secret word is ""apran"" but not a word? 

  Considering common words? ""ARSON"" seems more common? 

  But let me check if there are other words? 

  ""ARMEN"" is a word? Armenian? But not 5-letter? 

  ""AVAIL""? Doesn't fit pattern? 

  Actually, ""ARRAN""? not common? 

  So I think ""arson"" or ""argon"" are our best bets? 

  How about ""AXION""? 
      A X I O N -> 
        position1: X? Not R? -> no? 

  Therefore, I'll go with ""arson"" as the next guess? 

  But note: we haven't proved that A must be at position0? Because position4 is taken by N? And the positions that cannot hold A are 2 and 3? and we also have position1 taken by R? and position4 by N? So indeed, the only position for A is position0? So there is no other option? 

  Then we are certain the word starts with A and ends with N? and has R at position1? So the word must be A R _ _ N? 

  Therefore, I choose ""arson"" to test? 

  But also, ""argon"" is a gas? 

  And we haven't eliminated S, O or G? 

  So let me pick ""argon""? 

  Actually, let me see: we can choose one? 

  Since we have two possibilities? To get the most information? 

  But note: if we guess a word that has common letters? 

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that hasn't appeared? 

  However, after gathering more? I'll pick ""arson"".

  So guess: ""arson""

  However, let me double-check the feedback: 
      First guess: crane -> R✓ A- N- 
      Second guess: urban -> R✓ (again) A- N✓? 

      And deduced A must be at position0? 

      So if we guess ""arson"": 
          A: we expect ✓? because at position0? 
          R: ✓ at position1? 
          S: ? 
          O: ? 
          N: ✓? 

      Alternatively, if the word is ""argon"", we'd guess differently? 

  But we don't know? So we have to pick one? 

  Since ""arson"" is in the candidate set? I'll go with that.

  But wait: in the first guess ""crane"", we had an 'A' and it showed up as '-'? meaning that A was not at position2? but at position0 in the secret word? then in ""crane"", at position0 we have C? and at position2 we had A? So no overlap? 

  And now we are guessing A at position0? which was not tested? 

  So let's do ""arson"".Based on the feedback from both guesses:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**
   - R is confirmed at position 1 (second letter).
   - A is in the word but NOT at position 2 (third letter).
   - N is in the word but NOT at position 3 (fourth letter).
   - C and E are eliminated.

2. **Guess 2: ""urban""**
   - R is confirmed again at position 1 (second letter).
   - N is confirmed at position 4 (fifth letter) → **secret word ends with N**.
   - A is in the word but NOT at position 3 (fourth letter).
   - U and B are eliminated.

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**: 
  - Position 1: R
  - Position 4: N
- **A constraints**: 
  - Cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""urban"").
  - With positions 1 (R) and 4 (N) fixed, A must be at position 0 (first letter).  
  → **Secret word starts with A**.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, E, U, B.
- **Unfilled positions**: 
  - Position 2 (third letter): Unknown, cannot be A.
  - Position 3 (fourth letter): Unknown, cannot be A and not N (as N is fixed at position 4).

### Structure:
The secret word is: **A R ? ? N**  
We need a valid English word matching this pattern.

### Possible Words:
- **ARSON**: A R S O N (valid word).
- **ARGON**: A R G O N (valid but less common).
- Others like ""ARXEN"" or ""ARWIN"" are invalid/non-existent.

### Strategy:
Choose **ARSON** to test common letters (S and O) and resolve efficiently:
- Position 0: A (expected ✓ if correct).
- Position 1: R (✓).
- Position 2: S (tests new letter).
- Position 3: O (tests new letter).
- Position 4: N (✓).

This maximizes information while adhering to the constraints. If incorrect, feedback will clarify the remaining letters.",Guess 3: arson -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) S(✓) O(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
