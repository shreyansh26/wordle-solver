We are just starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 The goal of the first guess is to cover as many common letters as possible to get useful feedback.
 Common starting words in Wordle often use a mix of common vowels and consonants. Examples include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""AUDIO"", etc.

 After considering, I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). 
 However, note that ""A"" is repeated in some words but in this case, ""CRANE"" has unique letters which helps in maximizing information.

 But note: the English word must be valid and 5 letters.

 Alternatively, we can use ""RAISE"" which is another common starting word with three vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S).

 I think I will go with ""RAISE"" because it covers three vowels and two common consonants, and it doesn't repeat letters.

 But let me double-check: 
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. We have A, I, E -> three vowels.
 Common consonants: R, S are very common.

 Additionally, we can consider ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the cumulative result of roating, though not common) but might be less known.

 Since the game requires a valid English word, I'll stick with a well-known word: ""RAISE"".

 Therefore, my first guess will be ""RAISE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters R, A, S are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter I is in the word, but not in the third position.
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

Therefore, the secret word contains I and E, but not R, A, S.

We have to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain R, A, S (since they are absent).
- Contains I and E (we know they are present).
- We can try to put I and E in different positions to find their correct spots.
- Also, we should include other common letters that haven't been tried yet to get more information.

Letters we haven't tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know the word has 5 letters and must include I and E.

We should avoid the positions where we know they are wrong:
- I cannot be in position 3 (since it was in the third position in RAISE and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- E cannot be in position 5.

We can try to put I in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 and E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word (I and E) and three more to find.

We should try to use a word that has I and E and three new letters to maximize information.

Common letters to try: T, N, O, L, C, etc.

Let's think of words that contain I and E and don't have R, A, S.

Some possibilities:
- ""TIGER"" -> but has R (which we know is absent) -> invalid.
- ""FIELD"" -> no R, A, S. Contains F, I, E, L, D.
- ""PIECE"" -> has P, I, E, C, E -> but E is repeated? Also, we don't know if repetition is allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. However, in this feedback, we don't have any indication of repetition. But note: our first guess had unique letters. We should avoid repetition for now to get more information.

But note: the feedback for RAISE didn't show any duplicate, so we don't know if the secret word has duplicates. However, to maximize information, it's better to use a word with all unique letters.

So, let's avoid repeating letters for now.

""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> all unique. Let's check the positions:
- I is in position 2 (which is new, previously it was in 3) and E is in position 4 (previously it was in 5). So we are testing I in a new position and E in a new position.

But note: we don't know the correct positions for I and E. We only know they are not in position 3 and 5 respectively.

Another option: ""QUIET"" -> Q, U, I, E, T -> but Q and U are less common. Also, we have U and T.

""OPINE"" -> O, P, I, N, E -> no R, A, S. This has O, P, I, N, E. Unique letters.

""ALIEN"" -> but A is absent, so we cannot use A.

We must avoid A, R, S.

Let me list some words with I and E and without A, R, S:

- BILE: too short? We need 5 letters.
- We need 5-letter words.

5-letter words with I and E, without A, R, S:

- FIELD: F, I, E, L, D
- PIECE: P, I, E, C, E -> has duplicate E -> not ideal for information.
- NIECE: N, I, E, C, E -> duplicate E.
- TILDE: T, I, L, D, E -> T, I, L, D, E -> unique.
- WHINE: W, H, I, N, E -> unique.
- OPINE: O, P, I, N, E -> unique.

We can also consider words that put I and E in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong.

For example, we can try:
- I in position 1: e.g., ""ITCHY"" -> but no E? We must include E.
- I in position 1 and E in position 2: e.g., ""INLET"" -> I in 1, E in 4? Wait, let's see: INLET: I, N, L, E, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5). But E is in position 4 (which is new) and I in position 1 (new). Also, no A, R, S.

Similarly, we can try ""EXIST"" -> but E in position 1, X, I, S, T -> but S is absent, so we cannot use S.

We must avoid S.

So, ""EXIST"" is invalid because of S.

Another: ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> E is in position 5? But we know E is not in position 5? Wait, no: the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So we can put E in position 5? Actually, no: because the feedback for RAISE had E in position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, we must avoid putting E in position 5.

Similarly, I cannot be in position 3.

So, for our next guess, we must avoid:
- E in position 5
- I in position 3

Also, avoid letters R, A, S.

So, let's consider:

Option 1: ""FIELD"" -> positions: F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5)
- I is in position 2 (not 3) -> allowed.
- E is in position 3 (not 5) -> allowed.

Option 2: ""TILDE"" -> T(1), I(2), L(3), D(4), E(5) -> but E is in position 5 -> not allowed because we know E is not in position 5.

So, ""TILDE"" is invalid for E position.

Option 3: ""WHINE"" -> W(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> I is in position 3 -> not allowed (because we know I is not in position 3) and E in position 5 -> not allowed. So invalid.

Option 4: ""OPINE"" -> O(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> I in position 3 (invalid) and E in position 5 (invalid). So invalid.

Option 5: ""INLET"" -> I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5) -> I in position 1 (okay, not 3), E in position 4 (okay, not 5). But note: we have L in position 3 and T in position 5. This is acceptable.

But wait, we also have to avoid using known absent letters. We don't have R, A, S in ""INLET"". So it's okay.

Option 6: ""OILED"" -> O(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5) -> I in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok). And no R, A, S.

Both ""INLET"" and ""OILED"" and ""FIELD"" are candidates.

We want to maximize new letters. We have already tried: R, A, I, S, E.

So, for ""FIELD"": new letters: F, L, D
for ""INLET"": new letters: N, L, T (and I and E we already know)
for ""OILED"": new letters: O, L, D

We want to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: T, N, L, D, etc.

""INLET"" has T, N, L. ""FIELD"" has F, L, D. ""OILED"" has O, L, D.

T and N are very common, so ""INLET"" might be better.

But note: we have to consider the positions. We know I is not in 3 and E is not in 5. In ""INLET"", I is in 1 and E is in 4. We are testing I in a new position (1) and E in a new position (4).

Similarly, in ""FIELD"", I is in 2 and E in 3.

We don't have any information about the other positions.

Another candidate: ""CLIME"" -> C, L, I, M, E -> positions: C(1), L(2), I(3), M(4), E(5). But I is in 3 (invalid) and E in 5 (invalid). So no.

""EDICT"" -> E(1), D(2), I(3), C(4), T(5). But I in 3 (invalid) and E in 1 is okay? But we have E in position 1 and I in 3 (which is invalid). So no.

""DEIGN"" -> D, E, I, G, N -> positions: D(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). I in 3 -> invalid.

""BEIGY"" -> not a word? Probably not valid.

""KIEFS"" -> has S -> invalid.

So, let's stick with ""INLET"" or ""FIELD"" or ""OILED"".

Another one: ""OWIED"" -> not a word.

""TOILE"" -> T, O, I, L, E -> positions: T(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). I in 3 -> invalid, E in 5 -> invalid.

""EVITE"" -> E(1), V(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> I in 3 invalid, E duplicate and in 5 invalid.

So, back to ""INLET"", ""OILED"", ""FIELD"".

I think ""FIELD"" is a good choice because it tests I in position 2 and E in position 3, which are new positions.

But note: in ""FIELD"", we have E in position 3. We don't know if that is allowed. The feedback only said E is not in position 5, so position 3 is okay.

Similarly, in ""INLET"", we test I in position 1 and E in position 4.

We might also consider ""DICEY"" -> D, I, C, E, Y -> positions: D(1), I(2), C(3), E(4), Y(5). I in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok). And no R, A, S. And unique letters.

So, ""DICEY"" is also a candidate.

Now, we have several options. We should choose one that covers more common letters.

Common letters: E, T, N, L, etc. We already know E is in the word. We want to test T, N, L, D, etc.

""INLET"" has T, N, L.
""FIELD"" has F, L, D.
""OILED"" has O, L, D.
""DICEY"" has D, C, Y.

T and N are more common than F, O, C, Y.

So, ""INLET"" might be better.

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""INLET"" is a valid English word (meaning a small stream).

Similarly, ""FIELD"" is valid.

I think I'll go with ""INLET"" because it tests three very common consonants (T, N, L) and puts I and E in new positions.

So, my second guess: ""INLET""

But let me double-check the positions: 
- I is in position 1 (previously it was in 3, which was wrong, now we test 1)
- E is in position 4 (previously it was in 5, which was wrong, now we test 4)

We also get to check L in position 3, N in position 2, and T in position 5.

This should give us good information.

Alternatively, we could use a word that has I and E and also includes other vowels? But we know A is absent, so we don't need to test A again. We haven't tested O, U.

But in ""INLET"", we have no O or U.

But we can get that in future guesses.

I think ""INLET"" is a solid choice.

So, I'll go with ""INLET"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, and S are absent from the secret word (marked 'x').
- I is present but not in position 3 (marked '-').
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked '-').

For the next guess:
- Must include I and E (since they are in the word).
- Avoid R, A, S entirely (absent letters).
- I cannot be in position 3 (from previous feedback).
- E cannot be in position 5 (from previous feedback).
- To maximize information, choose a word with new, common consonants (e.g., T, N, L) and unique letters.

The word ""INLET"" fits these criteria:
- Contains I (in position 1, avoiding position 3) and E (in position 4, avoiding position 5).
- Includes new letters: T, N, L (common consonants not tested yet).
- Avoids R, A, S.
- All letters are unique, providing clear feedback.

This guess tests I and E in new positions and checks for the presence of T, N, and L.

<guess>INLET</guess>",INLET,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters R, A, S are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter I is in the word, but not in the third position.
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

Therefore, the secret word contains I and E, but not R, A, S.

We have to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain R, A, S (since they are absent).
- Contains I and E (we know they are present).
- We can try to put I and E in different positions to find their correct spots.
- Also, we should include other common letters that haven't been tried yet to get more information.

Letters we haven't tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know the word has 5 letters and must include I and E.

We should avoid the positions where we know they are wrong:
- I cannot be in position 3 (since it was in the third position in RAISE and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- E cannot be in position 5.

We can try to put I in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 and E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word (I and E) and three more to find.

We should try to use a word that has I and E and three new letters to maximize information.

Common letters to try: T, N, O, L, C, etc.

Let's think of words that contain I and E and don't have R, A, S.

Some possibilities:
- ""TIGER"" -> but has R (which we know is absent) -> invalid.
- ""FIELD"" -> no R, A, S. Contains F, I, E, L, D.
- ""PIECE"" -> has P, I, E, C, E -> but E is repeated? Also, we don't know if repetition is allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. However, in this feedback, we don't have any indication of repetition. But note: our first guess had unique letters. We should avoid repetition for now to get more information.

But note: the feedback for RAISE didn't show any duplicate, so we don't know if the secret word has duplicates. However, to maximize information, it's better to use a word with all unique letters.

So, let's avoid repeating letters for now.

""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> all unique. Let's check the positions:
- I is in position 2 (which is new, previously it was in 3) and E is in position 4 (previously it was in 5). So we are testing I in a new position and E in a new position.

But note: we don't know the correct positions for I and E. We only know they are not in position 3 and 5 respectively.

Another option: ""QUIET"" -> Q, U, I, E, T -> but Q and U are less common. Also, we have U and T.

""OPINE"" -> O, P, I, N, E -> no R, A, S. This has O, P, I, N, E. Unique letters.

""ALIEN"" -> but A is absent, so we cannot use A.

We must avoid A, R, S.

Let me list some words with I and E and without A, R, S:

- BILE: too short? We need 5 letters.
- We need 5-letter words.

5-letter words with I and E, without A, R, S:

- FIELD: F, I, E, L, D
- PIECE: P, I, E, C, E -> has duplicate E -> not ideal for information.
- NIECE: N, I, E, C, E -> duplicate E.
- TILDE: T, I, L, D, E -> T, I, L, D, E -> unique.
- WHINE: W, H, I, N, E -> unique.
- OPINE: O, P, I, N, E -> unique.

We can also consider words that put I and E in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong.

For example, we can try:
- I in position 1: e.g., ""ITCHY"" -> but no E? We must include E.
- I in position 1 and E in position 2: e.g., ""INLET"" -> I in 1, E in 4? Wait, let's see: INLET: I, N, L, E, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5). But E is in position 4 (which is new) and I in position 1 (new). Also, no A, R, S.

Similarly, we can try ""EXIST"" -> but E in position 1, X, I, S, T -> but S is absent, so we cannot use S.

We must avoid S.

So, ""EXIST"" is invalid because of S.

Another: ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> E is in position 5? But we know E is not in position 5? Wait, no: the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So we can put E in position 5? Actually, no: because the feedback for RAISE had E in position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, we must avoid putting E in position 5.

Similarly, I cannot be in position 3.

So, for our next guess, we must avoid:
- E in position 5
- I in position 3

Also, avoid letters R, A, S.

So, let's consider:

Option 1: ""FIELD"" -> positions: F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5)
- I is in position 2 (not 3) -> allowed.
- E is in position 3 (not 5) -> allowed.

Option 2: ""TILDE"" -> T(1), I(2), L(3), D(4), E(5) -> but E is in position 5 -> not allowed because we know E is not in position 5.

So, ""TILDE"" is invalid for E position.

Option 3: ""WHINE"" -> W(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> I is in position 3 -> not allowed (because we know I is not in position 3) and E in position 5 -> not allowed. So invalid.

Option 4: ""OPINE"" -> O(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> I in position 3 (invalid) and E in position 5 (invalid). So invalid.

Option 5: ""INLET"" -> I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5) -> I in position 1 (okay, not 3), E in position 4 (okay, not 5). But note: we have L in position 3 and T in position 5. This is acceptable.

But wait, we also have to avoid using known absent letters. We don't have R, A, S in ""INLET"". So it's okay.

Option 6: ""OILED"" -> O(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5) -> I in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok). And no R, A, S.

Both ""INLET"" and ""OILED"" and ""FIELD"" are candidates.

We want to maximize new letters. We have already tried: R, A, I, S, E.

So, for ""FIELD"": new letters: F, L, D
for ""INLET"": new letters: N, L, T (and I and E we already know)
for ""OILED"": new letters: O, L, D

We want to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: T, N, L, D, etc.

""INLET"" has T, N, L. ""FIELD"" has F, L, D. ""OILED"" has O, L, D.

T and N are very common, so ""INLET"" might be better.

But note: we have to consider the positions. We know I is not in 3 and E is not in 5. In ""INLET"", I is in 1 and E is in 4. We are testing I in a new position (1) and E in a new position (4).

Similarly, in ""FIELD"", I is in 2 and E in 3.

We don't have any information about the other positions.

Another candidate: ""CLIME"" -> C, L, I, M, E -> positions: C(1), L(2), I(3), M(4), E(5). But I is in 3 (invalid) and E in 5 (invalid). So no.

""EDICT"" -> E(1), D(2), I(3), C(4), T(5). But I in 3 (invalid) and E in 1 is okay? But we have E in position 1 and I in 3 (which is invalid). So no.

""DEIGN"" -> D, E, I, G, N -> positions: D(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). I in 3 -> invalid.

""BEIGY"" -> not a word? Probably not valid.

""KIEFS"" -> has S -> invalid.

So, let's stick with ""INLET"" or ""FIELD"" or ""OILED"".

Another one: ""OWIED"" -> not a word.

""TOILE"" -> T, O, I, L, E -> positions: T(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). I in 3 -> invalid, E in 5 -> invalid.

""EVITE"" -> E(1), V(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> I in 3 invalid, E duplicate and in 5 invalid.

So, back to ""INLET"", ""OILED"", ""FIELD"".

I think ""FIELD"" is a good choice because it tests I in position 2 and E in position 3, which are new positions.

But note: in ""FIELD"", we have E in position 3. We don't know if that is allowed. The feedback only said E is not in position 5, so position 3 is okay.

Similarly, in ""INLET"", we test I in position 1 and E in position 4.

We might also consider ""DICEY"" -> D, I, C, E, Y -> positions: D(1), I(2), C(3), E(4), Y(5). I in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok). And no R, A, S. And unique letters.

So, ""DICEY"" is also a candidate.

Now, we have several options. We should choose one that covers more common letters.

Common letters: E, T, N, L, etc. We already know E is in the word. We want to test T, N, L, D, etc.

""INLET"" has T, N, L.
""FIELD"" has F, L, D.
""OILED"" has O, L, D.
""DICEY"" has D, C, Y.

T and N are more common than F, O, C, Y.

So, ""INLET"" might be better.

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""INLET"" is a valid English word (meaning a small stream).

Similarly, ""FIELD"" is valid.

I think I'll go with ""INLET"" because it tests three very common consonants (T, N, L) and puts I and E in new positions.

So, my second guess: ""INLET""

But let me double-check the positions: 
- I is in position 1 (previously it was in 3, which was wrong, now we test 1)
- E is in position 4 (previously it was in 5, which was wrong, now we test 4)

We also get to check L in position 3, N in position 2, and T in position 5.

This should give us good information.

Alternatively, we could use a word that has I and E and also includes other vowels? But we know A is absent, so we don't need to test A again. We haven't tested O, U.

But in ""INLET"", we have no O or U.

But we can get that in future guesses.

I think ""INLET"" is a solid choice.

So, I'll go with ""INLET"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, and S are absent from the secret word (marked 'x').
- I is present but not in position 3 (marked '-').
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked '-').

For the next guess:
- Must include I and E (since they are in the word).
- Avoid R, A, S entirely (absent letters).
- I cannot be in position 3 (from previous feedback).
- E cannot be in position 5 (from previous feedback).
- To maximize information, choose a word with new, common consonants (e.g., T, N, L) and unique letters.

The word ""INLET"" fits these criteria:
- Contains I (in position 1, avoiding position 3) and E (in position 4, avoiding position 5).
- Includes new letters: T, N, L (common consonants not tested yet).
- Avoids R, A, S.
- All letters are unique, providing clear feedback.

This guess tests I and E in new positions and checks for the presence of T, N, and L.",Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(x) L(✓) E(✓) T(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are just starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to make an initial guess.
 The goal of the first guess is to cover as many common letters as possible to get useful feedback.
 Common starting words in Wordle often use a mix of common vowels and consonants. Examples include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""AUDIO"", etc.

 After considering, I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it includes three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). 
 However, note that ""A"" is repeated in some words but in this case, ""CRANE"" has unique letters which helps in maximizing information.

 But note: the English word must be valid and 5 letters.

 Alternatively, we can use ""RAISE"" which is another common starting word with three vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S).

 I think I will go with ""RAISE"" because it covers three vowels and two common consonants, and it doesn't repeat letters.

 But let me double-check: 
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U. We have A, I, E -> three vowels.
 Common consonants: R, S are very common.

 Additionally, we can consider ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the cumulative result of roating, though not common) but might be less known.

 Since the game requires a valid English word, I'll stick with a well-known word: ""RAISE"".

 Therefore, my first guess will be ""RAISE"".I'm making my first guess without any prior feedback. I need to choose a word that maximizes information by including common vowels and consonants. ""RAISE"" is an effective starter because it has three common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), all unique letters. This will help me gather feedback on frequent letters and their positions quickly.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters R, A, S are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter I is in the word, but not in the third position.
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

Therefore, the secret word contains I and E, but not R, A, S.

We have to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain R, A, S (since they are absent).
- Contains I and E (we know they are present).
- We can try to put I and E in different positions to find their correct spots.
- Also, we should include other common letters that haven't been tried yet to get more information.

Letters we haven't tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know the word has 5 letters and must include I and E.

We should avoid the positions where we know they are wrong:
- I cannot be in position 3 (since it was in the third position in RAISE and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- E cannot be in position 5.

We can try to put I in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 and E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we have two letters we know are in the word (I and E) and three more to find.

We should try to use a word that has I and E and three new letters to maximize information.

Common letters to try: T, N, O, L, C, etc.

Let's think of words that contain I and E and don't have R, A, S.

Some possibilities:
- ""TIGER"" -> but has R (which we know is absent) -> invalid.
- ""FIELD"" -> no R, A, S. Contains F, I, E, L, D.
- ""PIECE"" -> has P, I, E, C, E -> but E is repeated? Also, we don't know if repetition is allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. However, in this feedback, we don't have any indication of repetition. But note: our first guess had unique letters. We should avoid repetition for now to get more information.

But note: the feedback for RAISE didn't show any duplicate, so we don't know if the secret word has duplicates. However, to maximize information, it's better to use a word with all unique letters.

So, let's avoid repeating letters for now.

""FIELD"": F, I, E, L, D -> all unique. Let's check the positions:
- I is in position 2 (which is new, previously it was in 3) and E is in position 4 (previously it was in 5). So we are testing I in a new position and E in a new position.

But note: we don't know the correct positions for I and E. We only know they are not in position 3 and 5 respectively.

Another option: ""QUIET"" -> Q, U, I, E, T -> but Q and U are less common. Also, we have U and T.

""OPINE"" -> O, P, I, N, E -> no R, A, S. This has O, P, I, N, E. Unique letters.

""ALIEN"" -> but A is absent, so we cannot use A.

We must avoid A, R, S.

Let me list some words with I and E and without A, R, S:

- BILE: too short? We need 5 letters.
- We need 5-letter words.

5-letter words with I and E, without A, R, S:

- FIELD: F, I, E, L, D
- PIECE: P, I, E, C, E -> has duplicate E -> not ideal for information.
- NIECE: N, I, E, C, E -> duplicate E.
- TILDE: T, I, L, D, E -> T, I, L, D, E -> unique.
- WHINE: W, H, I, N, E -> unique.
- OPINE: O, P, I, N, E -> unique.

We can also consider words that put I and E in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong.

For example, we can try:
- I in position 1: e.g., ""ITCHY"" -> but no E? We must include E.
- I in position 1 and E in position 2: e.g., ""INLET"" -> I in 1, E in 4? Wait, let's see: INLET: I, N, L, E, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5). But E is in position 4 (which is new) and I in position 1 (new). Also, no A, R, S.

Similarly, we can try ""EXIST"" -> but E in position 1, X, I, S, T -> but S is absent, so we cannot use S.

We must avoid S.

So, ""EXIST"" is invalid because of S.

Another: ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> E is in position 5? But we know E is not in position 5? Wait, no: the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So we can put E in position 5? Actually, no: because the feedback for RAISE had E in position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, we must avoid putting E in position 5.

Similarly, I cannot be in position 3.

So, for our next guess, we must avoid:
- E in position 5
- I in position 3

Also, avoid letters R, A, S.

So, let's consider:

Option 1: ""FIELD"" -> positions: F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5)
- I is in position 2 (not 3) -> allowed.
- E is in position 3 (not 5) -> allowed.

Option 2: ""TILDE"" -> T(1), I(2), L(3), D(4), E(5) -> but E is in position 5 -> not allowed because we know E is not in position 5.

So, ""TILDE"" is invalid for E position.

Option 3: ""WHINE"" -> W(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> I is in position 3 -> not allowed (because we know I is not in position 3) and E in position 5 -> not allowed. So invalid.

Option 4: ""OPINE"" -> O(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> I in position 3 (invalid) and E in position 5 (invalid). So invalid.

Option 5: ""INLET"" -> I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5) -> I in position 1 (okay, not 3), E in position 4 (okay, not 5). But note: we have L in position 3 and T in position 5. This is acceptable.

But wait, we also have to avoid using known absent letters. We don't have R, A, S in ""INLET"". So it's okay.

Option 6: ""OILED"" -> O(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5) -> I in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok). And no R, A, S.

Both ""INLET"" and ""OILED"" and ""FIELD"" are candidates.

We want to maximize new letters. We have already tried: R, A, I, S, E.

So, for ""FIELD"": new letters: F, L, D
for ""INLET"": new letters: N, L, T (and I and E we already know)
for ""OILED"": new letters: O, L, D

We want to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: T, N, L, D, etc.

""INLET"" has T, N, L. ""FIELD"" has F, L, D. ""OILED"" has O, L, D.

T and N are very common, so ""INLET"" might be better.

But note: we have to consider the positions. We know I is not in 3 and E is not in 5. In ""INLET"", I is in 1 and E is in 4. We are testing I in a new position (1) and E in a new position (4).

Similarly, in ""FIELD"", I is in 2 and E in 3.

We don't have any information about the other positions.

Another candidate: ""CLIME"" -> C, L, I, M, E -> positions: C(1), L(2), I(3), M(4), E(5). But I is in 3 (invalid) and E in 5 (invalid). So no.

""EDICT"" -> E(1), D(2), I(3), C(4), T(5). But I in 3 (invalid) and E in 1 is okay? But we have E in position 1 and I in 3 (which is invalid). So no.

""DEIGN"" -> D, E, I, G, N -> positions: D(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). I in 3 -> invalid.

""BEIGY"" -> not a word? Probably not valid.

""KIEFS"" -> has S -> invalid.

So, let's stick with ""INLET"" or ""FIELD"" or ""OILED"".

Another one: ""OWIED"" -> not a word.

""TOILE"" -> T, O, I, L, E -> positions: T(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). I in 3 -> invalid, E in 5 -> invalid.

""EVITE"" -> E(1), V(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> I in 3 invalid, E duplicate and in 5 invalid.

So, back to ""INLET"", ""OILED"", ""FIELD"".

I think ""FIELD"" is a good choice because it tests I in position 2 and E in position 3, which are new positions.

But note: in ""FIELD"", we have E in position 3. We don't know if that is allowed. The feedback only said E is not in position 5, so position 3 is okay.

Similarly, in ""INLET"", we test I in position 1 and E in position 4.

We might also consider ""DICEY"" -> D, I, C, E, Y -> positions: D(1), I(2), C(3), E(4), Y(5). I in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok). And no R, A, S. And unique letters.

So, ""DICEY"" is also a candidate.

Now, we have several options. We should choose one that covers more common letters.

Common letters: E, T, N, L, etc. We already know E is in the word. We want to test T, N, L, D, etc.

""INLET"" has T, N, L.
""FIELD"" has F, L, D.
""OILED"" has O, L, D.
""DICEY"" has D, C, Y.

T and N are more common than F, O, C, Y.

So, ""INLET"" might be better.

But note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""INLET"" is a valid English word (meaning a small stream).

Similarly, ""FIELD"" is valid.

I think I'll go with ""INLET"" because it tests three very common consonants (T, N, L) and puts I and E in new positions.

So, my second guess: ""INLET""

But let me double-check the positions: 
- I is in position 1 (previously it was in 3, which was wrong, now we test 1)
- E is in position 4 (previously it was in 5, which was wrong, now we test 4)

We also get to check L in position 3, N in position 2, and T in position 5.

This should give us good information.

Alternatively, we could use a word that has I and E and also includes other vowels? But we know A is absent, so we don't need to test A again. We haven't tested O, U.

But in ""INLET"", we have no O or U.

But we can get that in future guesses.

I think ""INLET"" is a solid choice.

So, I'll go with ""INLET"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, and S are absent from the secret word (marked 'x').
- I is present but not in position 3 (marked '-').
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked '-').

For the next guess:
- Must include I and E (since they are in the word).
- Avoid R, A, S entirely (absent letters).
- I cannot be in position 3 (from previous feedback).
- E cannot be in position 5 (from previous feedback).
- To maximize information, choose a word with new, common consonants (e.g., T, N, L) and unique letters.

The word ""INLET"" fits these criteria:
- Contains I (in position 1, avoiding position 3) and E (in position 4, avoiding position 5).
- Includes new letters: T, N, L (common consonants not tested yet).
- Avoids R, A, S.
- All letters are unique, providing clear feedback.

This guess tests I and E in new positions and checks for the presence of T, N, and L.

So we are testing I in a new position and E in a new position.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know the correct positions for I and E. We only know they are not in position 3 and 5 respectively.\n\nAnother option: ""QUIET"" -> Q, U, I, E, T -> but Q and U are less common. Also, we have U and T.\n\n""OPINE"" -> O, P, I, N, E -> no R, A, S. This has O, P, I, N, E. Unique letters.\n\n""ALIEN"" -> but A is absent, so we cannot use A.\n\nWe must avoid A, R, S.\n\nLet me list some words with I and E and without A, R, S:\n\n- BILE: too short? We need 5 letters.\n- We need 5-letter words.\n\n5-letter words with I and E, without A, R, S:\n\n- FIELD: F, I, E, L, D\n- PIECE: P, I, E, C, E -> has duplicate E -> not ideal for information.\n- NIECE: N, I, E, C, E -> duplicate E.\n- TILDE: T, I, L, D, E -> T, I, L, D, E -> unique.\n- WHINE: W, H, I, N, E -> unique.\n- OPINE: O, P, I, N, E -> unique.\n\nWe can also consider words that put I and E in positions that are not the ones we know are wrong.\n\nFor example, we can try:\n- I in position 1: e.g., ""ITCHY"" -> but no E? We must include E.\n- I in position 1 and E in position 2: e.g., ""INLET"" -> I in 1, E in 4? Wait, let\'s see: INLET: I, N, L, E, T -> positions: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5). But E is in position 4 (which is new) and I in position 1 (new). Also, no A, R, S.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""EXIST"" -> but E in position 1, X, I, S, T -> but S is absent, so we cannot use S.\n\nWe must avoid S.\n\nSo, ""EXIST"" is invalid because of S.\n\nAnother: ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> E is in position 5? But we know E is not in position 5? Wait, no: the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So we can put E in position 5? Actually, no: because the feedback for RAISE had E in position 5 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, we must avoid putting E in position 5.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be in position 3.\n\nSo, for our next guess, we must avoid:\n- E in position 5\n- I in position 3\n\nAlso, avoid letters R, A, S.\n\nSo, let\'s consider:\n\nOption 1: ""FIELD"" -> positions: F(1), I(2), E(3), L(4), D(5)\n- I is in position 2 (not 3) -> allowed.\n- E is in position 3 (not 5) -> allowed.\n\nOption 2: ""TILDE"" -> T(1), I(2), L(3), D(4), E(5) -> but E is in position 5 -> not allowed because we know E is not in position 5.\n\nSo, ""TILDE"" is invalid for E position.\n\nOption 3: ""WHINE"" -> W(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> I is in position 3 -> not allowed (because we know I is not in position 3) and E in position 5 -> not allowed. So invalid.\n\nOption 4: ""OPINE"" -> O(1), P(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) -> I in position 3 (invalid) and E in position 5 (invalid). So invalid.\n\nOption 5: ""INLET"" -> I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5) -> I in position 1 (okay, not 3), E in position 4 (okay, not 5). But note: we have L in position 3 and T in position 5. This is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, we also have to avoid using known absent letters. We don\'t have R, A, S in ""INLET"". So it\'s okay.\n\nOption 6: ""OILED"" -> O(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5) -> I in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok). And no R, A, S.\n\nBoth ""INLET"" and ""OILED"" and ""FIELD"" are candidates.\n\nWe want to maximize new letters. We have already tried: R, A, I, S, E.\n\nSo, for ""FIELD"": new letters: F, L, D\nfor ""INLET"": new letters: N, L, T (and I and E we already know)\nfor ""OILED"": new letters: O, L, D\n\nWe want to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon consonants: T, N, L, D, etc.\n\n""INLET"" has T, N, L. ""FIELD"" has F, L, D. ""OILED"" has O, L, D.\n\nT and N are very common, so ""INLET"" might be better.\n\nBut note: we have to consider the positions. We know I is not in 3 and E is not in 5. In ""INLET"", I is in 1 and E is in 4. We are testing I in a new position (1) and E in a new position (4).\n\nSimilarly, in ""FIELD"", I is in 2 and E in 3.\n\nWe don\'t have any information about the other positions.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CLIME"" -> C, L, I, M, E -> positions: C(1), L(2), I(3), M(4), E(5). But I is in 3 (invalid) and E in 5 (invalid). So no.\n\n""EDICT"" -> E(1), D(2), I(3), C(4), T(5). But I in 3 (invalid) and E in 1 is okay? But we have E in position 1 and I in 3 (which is invalid). So no.\n\n""DEIGN"" -> D, E, I, G, N -> positions: D(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). I in 3 -> invalid.\n\n""BEIGY"" -> not a word? Probably not valid.\n\n""KIEFS"" -> has S -> invalid.\n\nSo, let\'s stick with ""INLET"" or ""FIELD"" or ""OILED"".\n\nAnother one: ""OWIED"" -> not a word.\n\n""TOILE"" -> T, O, I, L, E -> positions: T(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), E(5). I in 3 -> invalid, E in 5 -> invalid.\n\n""EVITE"" -> E(1), V(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) -> I in 3 invalid, E duplicate and in 5 invalid.\n\nSo, back to ""INLET"", ""OILED"", ""FIELD"".\n\nI think ""FIELD"" is a good choice because it tests I in position 2 and E in position 3, which are new positions.\n\nBut note: in ""FIELD"", we have E in position 3. We don\'t know if that is allowed. The feedback only said E is not in position 5, so position 3 is okay.\n\nSimilarly, in ""INLET"", we test I in position 1 and E in position 4.\n\nWe might also consider ""DICEY"" -> D, I, C, E, Y -> positions: D(1), I(2), C(3), E(4), Y(5). I in 2 (ok), E in 4 (ok). And no R, A, S. And unique letters.\n\nSo, ""DICEY"" is also a candidate.\n\nNow, we have several options. We should choose one that covers more common letters.\n\nCommon letters: E, T, N, L, etc. We already know E is in the word. We want to test T, N, L, D, etc.\n\n""INLET"" has T, N, L.\n""FIELD"" has F, L, D.\n""OILED"" has O, L, D.\n""DICEY"" has D, C, Y.\n\nT and N are more common than F, O, C, Y.\n\nSo, ""INLET"" might be better.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure the word is valid. ""INLET"" is a valid English word (meaning a small stream).\n\nSimilarly, ""FIELD"" is valid.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""INLET"" because it tests three very common consonants (T, N, L) and puts I and E in new positions.\n\nSo, my second guess: ""INLET""\n\nBut let me double-check the positions: \n- I is in position 1 (previously it was in 3, which was wrong, now we test 1)\n- E is in position 4 (previously it was in 5, which was wrong, now we test 4)\n\nWe also get to check L in position 3, N in position 2, and T in position 5.\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word that has I and E and also includes other vowels? But we know A is absent, so we don\'t need to test A again. We haven\'t tested O, U.\n\nBut in ""INLET"", we have no O or U.\n\nBut we can get that in future guesses.\n\nI think ""INLET"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""INLET"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, A, and S are absent from the secret word (marked \'x\').\n- I is present but not in position 3 (marked \'-\').\n- E is present but not in position 5 (marked \'-\').\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include I and E (since they are in the word).\n- Avoid R, A, S entirely (absent letters).\n- I cannot be in position 3 (from previous feedback).\n- E cannot be in position 5 (from previous feedback).\n- To maximize information, choose a word with new, common consonants (e.g., T, N, L) and unique letters.\n\nThe word ""INLET"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains I (in position 1, avoiding position 3) and E (in position 4, avoiding position 5).\n- Includes new letters: T, N, L (common consonants not tested yet).\n- Avoids R, A, S.\n- All letters are unique, providing clear feedback.\n\nThis guess tests I and E in new positions and checks for the presence of T, N, and L.\n\n<guess>INLET</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(x) L(✓) E(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for Guess 2: INLET -> I(-), N(x), L(✓), E(✓), T(✓)

Breaking down:
- I is in the word but not in position 1 (since '-' indicates wrong position).
- N is not in the word (x).
- L is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since L is the third letter and got ✓).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since E is the fourth letter and got ✓).
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since T is the fifth letter and got ✓).

So, we now know:
- The secret word has the third letter L, fourth letter E, and fifth letter T.
- Therefore, the word ends with ""LET"" (positions 3,4,5: L, E, T).

Additionally, we know:
- The letter I is in the word, but not in position 1 (from this guess) and not in position 3 (from the first guess).
- Since position 3 is L (fixed), position 4 and 5 are E and T, so I must be in position 2 (the only remaining position) or possibly in position 1? But wait, we know from Guess 2 that I is not in position 1 (because it was marked '-'), and from Guess 1 that I is not in position 3 (in RAISE, I was position 3 and got '-'). The positions are: 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 3 is L (fixed), position 4 is E (fixed), position 5 is T (fixed). So I cannot be in position 3,4,5. Therefore, I must be in position 2? But position 1 is the only other possibility, and in Guess 2, I was in position 1 and was marked as '-' meaning I is in the word but not that position. So I cannot be in position 1 either? Then where can it be?

Wait, positions:
- Position 1: cannot have I because in INLET, I at position 1 got '-' -> wrong position, but I is in the word.
- Position 3: cannot have I because in RAISE, I at position 3 got '-' -> wrong position, but in RAISE, position 3 was I and marked '-', so I is not at position 3.
- Position 4 and 5 are E and T, which are fixed, so I cannot be there.

Therefore, the only possibility left is position 2. So I must be in position 2.

But wait, in the current feedback, I was tried in position 1 and got '-', meaning I is present but not in position 1. And we have position 3,4,5 fixed. So position 2 is the only remaining spot? Yes, because the word is 5 letters.

Therefore, the second letter must be I.

So the secret word is: _ I L E T

We need to find the first letter.

We also know that R, A, S, and N are absent (from previous feedback).

From Guess 1: R, A, S are absent.
From Guess 2: N is absent.

We have one missing letter (position 1) that hasn't been tested yet.

We know the first letter cannot be R, A, S, N (absent), and cannot be I (because if it were I, then in INLET, position 2 would be N, but we have I in position 2). Actually, we are saying position 2 is I, so position 1 is a different letter.

The missing letter is in position 1.

We must choose a word that matches the pattern: [letter] I L E T

We know the word has I in position 2, L in 3, E in 4, T in 5.

The unknown is position 1.

We must avoid letters R, A, S, N (because we know they are absent).

Also, we know E is in position 4 and T in 5, so we don't need to test other positions for them.

But our guess must be a valid English word of the form _ I L E T.

We should choose a word that uses a new letter for position 1 to test if it is present.

What letters are available? We haven't tested many: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we must avoid R, A, S, N.

Common letters: B, C, D, F, etc.

We can list possible words:

- FILET: F(1) I(2) L(3) E(4) T(5) -> valid word (as in filet mignon)

- BILET: Not a common word? Billet is 6 letters. Bilet might be a variant, but let's see: in English, ""billet"" is 6 letters. So probably not valid.

- CILET: Not a word.

- WILET: Not a common word. Wilet? Not recognized.

- MIFLET: wait, 6 letters.

We need words that end with ""ILET"". But let me think of words with pattern XILET.

- FILEET: 6 letters.

Another: ""TILET"" -> not a word.

Perhaps I missed.

""FILET"" is a valid word. Meaning: a boneless piece of meat or fish.

Other possibilities: ""VIXET"" -> no.

""PILET"" -> not common, may be a surname.

But ""filet"" is played in Scrabble, so it should be valid.

Another: ""WILET"" is a bird? But I think ""willet"" is 6 letters.

""OWILET"" - too long.

Common words: definitely ""filet"".

Also, ""smilet"" is 6 letters, no.

So, ""FILET"" seems to be a valid candidate.

We also have ""billet"" but that's 6 letters.

Another: ""islet"" but that would be I in position 1? But we need position 2 to be I? So ""islet"" has I in position 1 and S in position 2? But S is absent? Also, our pattern requires position 2 to be I, so ""islet"" would be I S L E T -> position 2 is S, which is absent? So invalid.

Similarly, ""inlet"" we already tried, and it had N which is absent.

So, back to ""FILET"".

In ""FILET"", F is position 1, which we haven't tested.

We can also consider ""CIELT"" -> not a word.

""GUILT"" -> G U I L T -> positions: G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), T(5). But we require L at position 3? In ""GUILT"", L is at position 4? Our pattern requires L at position 3, E at position 4, T at position 5. But ""GUILT"" ends with ILT? No: G-U-I-L-T -> positions: 1-G, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-T. So it has I at position 3? But we know position 3 must be L? So it doesn't match.

For the word to have position 3: L, position 4: E, position 5: T, it must be ? I L E T.

So the pattern is: [letter] I L E T

Therefore, possible words:

- FILET: valid.
- BILET: not a word, usually with double L: ""billet"".
- CIELT: not a word.
- PIELT: Piel might be a name, but not common.
- SORRY, S is absent.

Another: ""WILET"" may be accepted in some dictionaries? Or ""willet"" without one L? No.

""DIKET"" not a word.

Probably ""filet"" is the main option.

We can also consider ""HILET"" -> not a word.

Or ""XILET"" -> not.

So, perhaps ""FILET"" is our best bet.

But also, note that we know I is in the word and must be in position 2? Actually, we deduced it must be in position 2 because all other positions are impossible.

But let me confirm: from feedback, we know I is not in position 1 (from INLET), not in position 3 (from RAISE and INLET confirmed position 3 is L), and positions 4 and 5 are fixed to E and T. So yes, only position 2 left for I.

Therefore, the secret word is ? I L E T.

Now, we need to test for position 1.

We don't know what the first letter is, so by guessing a word that fits the pattern, we will get direct feedback on if the letter is correct and in position, or if not.

In this case, guessing ""FILET"" would test F in position 1.

If F is correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that F is absent or something.

We might also consider words that introduce a new letter that hasn't been tested, but in this case, we have to stick to the pattern because the last three letters are fixed.

So our guess must be in the form X I L E T.

Therefore, the only common word is ""FILET"".

We can check: ""milet"" is not common.

But in any case, we can use it.

Another word: ""vilet"" no.

So, I think ""filet"" is acceptable.

Therefore, I will guess ""FILET"".

But note: in the feedback of Guess 2, we have T(✓) meaning T is correct and in position 5, which matches.

Similarly E in 4.

So, with this we are testing the remaining mystery letter.

If we get all ✓, we win.

If F is wrong, we'll know it's absent and then we can try other letters.

But let's hope it's correct.

To be thorough, are there other possibilities?

Is there any word that has a different letter but also fits X I L E T?

Like ""BILET"": not a standard word, but if we guess ""FILET"" and F is wrong, then we know to try others, like perhaps if it accepts ""oilet"" or something? Unlikely.

We might also consider that the letter in position 1 could be a vowel? But in ""filet"", F is consonant.

Another possibility: ""islet"" is a common word, but that is I position 1, S position 2? But S is absent, so it can't be. Also, our pattern requires position 2 to be I.

So ""islet"" is I S L E T -> but S is absent, so invalid.

Similarly, ""inlet"" we tried and N is absent.

So, I think ""filet"" is the way to go.

Therefore, I'll guess ""FILET"".

But wait, let's write it in uppercase: FILET.

In the response, we must output in the format.

So, step-by-step: We have deduced the word is ?ILET. The only position unknown is 1. We tested INLET with N at position 2? No, in INLET, position 2 was N and it got 'x', so N is absent. But our pattern requires position 2 to be I, which is different.

In our guess of INLET, we had: I(1) N(2) L(3) E(4) T(5). Now we know position 3,4,5 are L, E, T and fixed. Position 1 cannot be I (from feedback) and must be I? Contradiction?

No: we have feedback that I is in the word but not in position 1. And we know positions 3,4,5 are L,E,T fixed. So position 2 is the only place left for I? Yes.

Therefore, position 2 must be I.

So the word is [letter1] I L E T.

Guess: ""FILET""

If not, but I think it must be.
</think>
### Thought Process

After reviewing the feedback:
- **Guess 1: RAISE** → R(x), A(x), I(-), S(x), E(-)  
  This indicates:
  - R, A, and S are **absent**.
  - I is present but **not in position 3**.
  - E is present but **not in position 5**.

- **Guess 2: INLET** → I(-), N(x), L(✓), E(✓), T(✓)  
  This indicates:
  - I is present but **not in position 1** (since it was guessed in position 1 and marked as wrong position).
  - N is **absent**.
  - L, E, and T are **correct and in positions 3, 4, and 5**, respectively. This means the word ends with ""LET"" (positions 3–5: L, E, T).

**Key deductions:**
- The secret word must be in the form `[?] I L E T`, because:
  - Positions 3, 4, 5 are fixed as L, E, T (from L(✓), E(✓), T(✓)).
  - I must be in position 2:
    - I cannot be in position 1 (based on INLET feedback: I(-)).
    - I cannot be in position 3 (based on RAISE feedback: I(-) at position 3).
    - Positions 4 and 5 are E and T, so I must be in position 2.
- Absent letters so far: A, R, S, N (marked 'x' in both guesses).
- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern `[unknown letter] I L E T`, with the unknown letter being a letter not yet tested and not one of the absent letters (A, R, S, N).

**Selecting the next guess:**
- The guess must fit the pattern `X I L E T` and be a valid English word.
- Possible words include ""FILET"" (a valid word meaning a boneless cut of meat or fish) or less common words like ""VIZET"" (misspelling) or ""PILET"" (rare surname), but ""FILET"" is the most common and valid option.
- Guessing ""FILET"" tests the unknown first letter (F). If correct, it solves the puzzle (since all positions would match). If incorrect, the feedback will confirm F's status (absent or present, though likely absent if not ✓), narrowing future guesses.

Given the pattern `? I L E T` and absent letters (A, R, S, N), ""FILET"" is a strong candidate for the next guess.

<guess>FILET</guess>",FILET,"We are given feedback for Guess 2: INLET -> I(-), N(x), L(✓), E(✓), T(✓)

Breaking down:
- I is in the word but not in position 1 (since '-' indicates wrong position).
- N is not in the word (x).
- L is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since L is the third letter and got ✓).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since E is the fourth letter and got ✓).
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since T is the fifth letter and got ✓).

So, we now know:
- The secret word has the third letter L, fourth letter E, and fifth letter T.
- Therefore, the word ends with ""LET"" (positions 3,4,5: L, E, T).

Additionally, we know:
- The letter I is in the word, but not in position 1 (from this guess) and not in position 3 (from the first guess).
- Since position 3 is L (fixed), position 4 and 5 are E and T, so I must be in position 2 (the only remaining position) or possibly in position 1? But wait, we know from Guess 2 that I is not in position 1 (because it was marked '-'), and from Guess 1 that I is not in position 3 (in RAISE, I was position 3 and got '-'). The positions are: 1,2,3,4,5.

Position 3 is L (fixed), position 4 is E (fixed), position 5 is T (fixed). So I cannot be in position 3,4,5. Therefore, I must be in position 2? But position 1 is the only other possibility, and in Guess 2, I was in position 1 and was marked as '-' meaning I is in the word but not that position. So I cannot be in position 1 either? Then where can it be?

Wait, positions:
- Position 1: cannot have I because in INLET, I at position 1 got '-' -> wrong position, but I is in the word.
- Position 3: cannot have I because in RAISE, I at position 3 got '-' -> wrong position, but in RAISE, position 3 was I and marked '-', so I is not at position 3.
- Position 4 and 5 are E and T, which are fixed, so I cannot be there.

Therefore, the only possibility left is position 2. So I must be in position 2.

But wait, in the current feedback, I was tried in position 1 and got '-', meaning I is present but not in position 1. And we have position 3,4,5 fixed. So position 2 is the only remaining spot? Yes, because the word is 5 letters.

Therefore, the second letter must be I.

So the secret word is: _ I L E T

We need to find the first letter.

We also know that R, A, S, and N are absent (from previous feedback).

From Guess 1: R, A, S are absent.
From Guess 2: N is absent.

We have one missing letter (position 1) that hasn't been tested yet.

We know the first letter cannot be R, A, S, N (absent), and cannot be I (because if it were I, then in INLET, position 2 would be N, but we have I in position 2). Actually, we are saying position 2 is I, so position 1 is a different letter.

The missing letter is in position 1.

We must choose a word that matches the pattern: [letter] I L E T

We know the word has I in position 2, L in 3, E in 4, T in 5.

The unknown is position 1.

We must avoid letters R, A, S, N (because we know they are absent).

Also, we know E is in position 4 and T in 5, so we don't need to test other positions for them.

But our guess must be a valid English word of the form _ I L E T.

We should choose a word that uses a new letter for position 1 to test if it is present.

What letters are available? We haven't tested many: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we must avoid R, A, S, N.

Common letters: B, C, D, F, etc.

We can list possible words:

- FILET: F(1) I(2) L(3) E(4) T(5) -> valid word (as in filet mignon)

- BILET: Not a common word? Billet is 6 letters. Bilet might be a variant, but let's see: in English, ""billet"" is 6 letters. So probably not valid.

- CILET: Not a word.

- WILET: Not a common word. Wilet? Not recognized.

- MIFLET: wait, 6 letters.

We need words that end with ""ILET"". But let me think of words with pattern XILET.

- FILEET: 6 letters.

Another: ""TILET"" -> not a word.

Perhaps I missed.

""FILET"" is a valid word. Meaning: a boneless piece of meat or fish.

Other possibilities: ""VIXET"" -> no.

""PILET"" -> not common, may be a surname.

But ""filet"" is played in Scrabble, so it should be valid.

Another: ""WILET"" is a bird? But I think ""willet"" is 6 letters.

""OWILET"" - too long.

Common words: definitely ""filet"".

Also, ""smilet"" is 6 letters, no.

So, ""FILET"" seems to be a valid candidate.

We also have ""billet"" but that's 6 letters.

Another: ""islet"" but that would be I in position 1? But we need position 2 to be I? So ""islet"" has I in position 1 and S in position 2? But S is absent? Also, our pattern requires position 2 to be I, so ""islet"" would be I S L E T -> position 2 is S, which is absent? So invalid.

Similarly, ""inlet"" we already tried, and it had N which is absent.

So, back to ""FILET"".

In ""FILET"", F is position 1, which we haven't tested.

We can also consider ""CIELT"" -> not a word.

""GUILT"" -> G U I L T -> positions: G(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), T(5). But we require L at position 3? In ""GUILT"", L is at position 4? Our pattern requires L at position 3, E at position 4, T at position 5. But ""GUILT"" ends with ILT? No: G-U-I-L-T -> positions: 1-G, 2-U, 3-I, 4-L, 5-T. So it has I at position 3? But we know position 3 must be L? So it doesn't match.

For the word to have position 3: L, position 4: E, position 5: T, it must be ? I L E T.

So the pattern is: [letter] I L E T

Therefore, possible words:

- FILET: valid.
- BILET: not a word, usually with double L: ""billet"".
- CIELT: not a word.
- PIELT: Piel might be a name, but not common.
- SORRY, S is absent.

Another: ""WILET"" may be accepted in some dictionaries? Or ""willet"" without one L? No.

""DIKET"" not a word.

Probably ""filet"" is the main option.

We can also consider ""HILET"" -> not a word.

Or ""XILET"" -> not.

So, perhaps ""FILET"" is our best bet.

But also, note that we know I is in the word and must be in position 2? Actually, we deduced it must be in position 2 because all other positions are impossible.

But let me confirm: from feedback, we know I is not in position 1 (from INLET), not in position 3 (from RAISE and INLET confirmed position 3 is L), and positions 4 and 5 are fixed to E and T. So yes, only position 2 left for I.

Therefore, the secret word is ? I L E T.

Now, we need to test for position 1.

We don't know what the first letter is, so by guessing a word that fits the pattern, we will get direct feedback on if the letter is correct and in position, or if not.

In this case, guessing ""FILET"" would test F in position 1.

If F is correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that F is absent or something.

We might also consider words that introduce a new letter that hasn't been tested, but in this case, we have to stick to the pattern because the last three letters are fixed.

So our guess must be in the form X I L E T.

Therefore, the only common word is ""FILET"".

We can check: ""milet"" is not common.

But in any case, we can use it.

Another word: ""vilet"" no.

So, I think ""filet"" is acceptable.

Therefore, I will guess ""FILET"".

But note: in the feedback of Guess 2, we have T(✓) meaning T is correct and in position 5, which matches.

Similarly E in 4.

So, with this we are testing the remaining mystery letter.

If we get all ✓, we win.

If F is wrong, we'll know it's absent and then we can try other letters.

But let's hope it's correct.

To be thorough, are there other possibilities?

Is there any word that has a different letter but also fits X I L E T?

Like ""BILET"": not a standard word, but if we guess ""FILET"" and F is wrong, then we know to try others, like perhaps if it accepts ""oilet"" or something? Unlikely.

We might also consider that the letter in position 1 could be a vowel? But in ""filet"", F is consonant.

Another possibility: ""islet"" is a common word, but that is I position 1, S position 2? But S is absent, so it can't be. Also, our pattern requires position 2 to be I.

So ""islet"" is I S L E T -> but S is absent, so invalid.

Similarly, ""inlet"" we tried and N is absent.

So, I think ""filet"" is the way to go.

Therefore, I'll guess ""FILET"".

But wait, let's write it in uppercase: FILET.

In the response, we must output in the format.

So, step-by-step: We have deduced the word is ?ILET. The only position unknown is 1. We tested INLET with N at position 2? No, in INLET, position 2 was N and it got 'x', so N is absent. But our pattern requires position 2 to be I, which is different.

In our guess of INLET, we had: I(1) N(2) L(3) E(4) T(5). Now we know position 3,4,5 are L, E, T and fixed. Position 1 cannot be I (from feedback) and must be I? Contradiction?

No: we have feedback that I is in the word but not in position 1. And we know positions 3,4,5 are L,E,T fixed. So position 2 is the only place left for I? Yes.

Therefore, position 2 must be I.

So the word is [letter1] I L E T.

Guess: ""FILET""

If not, but I think it must be.### Thought Process

After reviewing the feedback:
- **Guess 1: RAISE** → R(x), A(x), I(-), S(x), E(-)  
  This indicates:
  - R, A, and S are **absent**.
  - I is present but **not in position 3**.
  - E is present but **not in position 5**.

- **Guess 2: INLET** → I(-), N(x), L(✓), E(✓), T(✓)  
  This indicates:
  - I is present but **not in position 1** (since it was guessed in position 1 and marked as wrong position).
  - N is **absent**.
  - L, E, and T are **correct and in positions 3, 4, and 5**, respectively. This means the word ends with ""LET"" (positions 3–5: L, E, T).

**Key deductions:**
- The secret word must be in the form `[?] I L E T`, because:
  - Positions 3, 4, 5 are fixed as L, E, T (from L(✓), E(✓), T(✓)).
  - I must be in position 2:
    - I cannot be in position 1 (based on INLET feedback: I(-)).
    - I cannot be in position 3 (based on RAISE feedback: I(-) at position 3).
    - Positions 4 and 5 are E and T, so I must be in position 2.
- Absent letters so far: A, R, S, N (marked 'x' in both guesses).
- Therefore, the secret word has the pattern `[unknown letter] I L E T`, with the unknown letter being a letter not yet tested and not one of the absent letters (A, R, S, N).

**Selecting the next guess:**
- The guess must fit the pattern `X I L E T` and be a valid English word.
- Possible words include ""FILET"" (a valid word meaning a boneless cut of meat or fish) or less common words like ""VIZET"" (misspelling) or ""PILET"" (rare surname), but ""FILET"" is the most common and valid option.
- Guessing ""FILET"" tests the unknown first letter (F). If correct, it solves the puzzle (since all positions would match). If incorrect, the feedback will confirm F's status (absent or present, though likely absent if not ✓), narrowing future guesses.

Given the pattern `? I L E T` and absent letters (A, R, S, N), ""FILET"" is a strong candidate for the next guess.",Guess 3: FILET -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) I(✓) L(✓) E(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
