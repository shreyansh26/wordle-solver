We are starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet.
 We want a starting word that has a good mix of common letters and covers multiple possibilities.
 Common starting words in games like Wordle often use words with common vowels and consonants to maximize information.

 A popular choice is ""CRANE"" because it contains common letters: C, R, A, N, E. 
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"" are also good options.

 However, note that the word must be a valid English word. 

 Let's choose ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). 
 This may help in identifying or eliminating several letters.

 But note: the problem states that the feedback will tell us:
   ✓ : correct letter and position
   - : letter in word but wrong position
   x : letter not in word

 Therefore, let's begin with ""RAISE"".

 So the first guess: RAISE
</think>
In this first guess, since there is no prior feedback, the goal is to maximize information by choosing a word with common letters. ""RAISE"" is an effective starting word because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- These letters frequently appear in English words, increasing the chances of getting useful feedback about their presence and positions.
- The feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the second letter)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So from this feedback, we know:
- The word has the letter 'A' in the second position.
- The word contains the letter 'I', but not in the third position (since that's where we guessed it).
- The letters R, S, E are not in the word.

Also note: Since R, S, E are not in the word, we must avoid using them in future guesses.

Now, we have to make a second guess. We know the second letter is 'A'. We also know that the word contains 'I' somewhere else.

We have 5 positions: [1,2,3,4,5] and we know position 2 is 'A'.

Since 'I' is in the word but not at position 3, it must be at position 1, 4, or 5.

We also know that R, S, E are excluded.

We should try to choose a word that:
- Has 'A' as the second letter.
- Includes 'I' in one of the positions 1,4,5, but not 3 (since we know it's not at 3).
- Avoids R, S, E.

Additionally, we can try to include other common letters to get more information.

Possible common letters that we haven't tested: there are many, but we have eliminated R, S, E. So let's avoid those.

We might consider letters like T, N, O, L, U, D, C, H, M, etc.

But note: we have only tried one word so far, so we don't know about many letters.

We know the word has an 'I', so let's try to cover other vowels and consonants.

One strategy is to try a word that has 'I' in a possible position (i.e., position 1,4, or 5) and also tests other common letters.

Also, we must not use R, S, E.

Let's think of words that have:
- Position 2: 'A'
- And one of: I at position 1, I at position 4, or I at position 5.

We can also consider that if we put I at position 1, then we must test a word starting with I. But note, we don't know if I is at position 1 or not. Similarly for 4 and 5.

Alternatively, we can try to put I in position 4 or 5 to see if it fits there, while testing new letters.

But note: we have limited options because we must avoid R, S, E.

Let's list some words that fit:

Option 1: I at position 1 -> words starting with I, second letter A.
  Example: ""IA__?"" - but we need a 5-letter word. Words like: IAMBI, but that might be obscure. More common: I could think of ""INLAW"", but let's check letters:
    INLAW: I at position 1, N at 2? Wait second letter must be A, so not.

We need second letter A. So words with pattern: [letter]A[letter][letter][letter] and the first letter can be I? But then the word would be ""IA___"". There aren't many common words starting with ""IA"". Examples: IAMBI (uncommon), IAMBS (uncommon). Probably not good.

Option 2: I at position 4 -> pattern: __A I _? (with no R,S,E). For example: words that have third letter something, then fourth letter I, and fifth letter something.

Option 3: I at position 5 -> pattern: __A _ I (with no R,S,E).

Also, we can test other vowels? But we know E is excluded, and we have A and I. The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but often.

But note: we have excluded E, so we might avoid E.

We also know that the word cannot have duplicate letters? Not necessarily. The rules don't say. So there might be duplicates, but we haven't encountered any.

Let's look for words that satisfy:
- Second letter 'A'
- No R, S, E
- Include the letter 'I' in position 4 or 5.

Plus use letters that are common to maximize information.

Try words with I at position 4: ? A ? I

For example:
- The fourth letter is I, so pattern: [a letter] A [a letter] I [a letter]

Examples: 
  ""HAVOC"" -> but sixth letter? No, 5 letters. H A V O C? That has no I.

  ""MANIC"": M A N I C -> This has 'I' at position 4? Positions: 1=M, 2=A, 3=N, 4=I, 5=C -> yes.

Does ""MANIC"" contain any of the excluded letters? R, S, E? No. So it's good.

But note: we haven't tested M, N, C. Also, this word uses M, N, C which are common.

Alternatively, consider I at position 5: pattern: ? A ? ? I

Example: ""TOPAZ"" -> T O P A Z? No, second letter O? We need second letter A.

Actually: the word must have second letter A and last letter I? So pattern: [letter] A [letter] [letter] I

Examples: ""RADII"" -> but R is excluded, so no. ""TAPIR"": T A P I R -> but 'I' is at position 4? Then position 5 is R -> R is excluded, so invalid.

""MANIA"": M A N I A -> this has I at position 4? Positions: 1=M, 2=A, 3=N, 4=I, 5=A. So I at 4? But note: this word has duplicate A? That's possible. But is it valid? And letters: M, A, N, I, A. No R,S,E. So valid.

But with ""MANIA"", we test M, A, N, I. We already know A and I are present, so we are testing M and N and also the positions.

Another option: ""CAULK"" -> but no I.

""VALID"": V A L I D -> I at position 4? Positions: 1=V, 2=A, 3=L, 4=I, 5=D -> yes, and no R,S,E.

""RAPID"" -> R is excluded.

""SAVIN"" -> S excluded and also S at the start? But S is excluded.

So among the options: 
- MANIC: M at 1, A at 2 (known), N at 3, I at 4, C at 5. Tests M,N,C.
- MANIA: M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, I at 4, A at 5. Tests M,N (duplicate A but that's okay).
- VALID: V at 1, A at 2, L at 3, I at 4, D at 5. Tests V,L,D.

Which one gives more information? We want to test more new letters.

Note: ""MANIC"" and ""MANIA"" both test M and N. But MANIC tests C (less common) and MANIA ends with A (which we already know A is present, so duplicate might be redundant? Not necessarily, because if the word has two A's, then we need to know).

We also must consider that the word might have two A's? Since A is in position 2 and we see A at the end, we would get feedback about that.

But in MANIA, if the word doesn't have A at the end, then the fifth letter will be marked x or -. But here we are guessing A at fifth, so if it's not present, we'll get x for that A, meaning no duplicate A? Wait no: if the word has only one A and we guess A at fifth, we might get '-' if A is elsewhere? But we know A is at second already. So if the word has only one A and it's at second, then guessing A at fifth would mark as x because it's not in the word elsewhere. Then we would know no duplicate.

Similarly, if we get '-' at fifth for A? Then that means A would appear twice? But if the word already has A at position 2, and we guess A at fifth, then if there is a second A, we might get '-'? Only if that second A is not at position 5? Because position 5 is wrong then.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe we should pick a word that avoids duplicates to reduce complexity.

Let's look for words without repeated letters.

""VALID"": V A L I D -> no duplicates. And letters V, L, D are new.

""PANIC"": P A N I C -> no duplicates? P, A, N, I, C. But A and I are repeated? No, each letter is distinct.

Similarly, ""MANIC"" also distinct: M, A, N, I, C.

""VALID"" is another distinct letter word.

But ""PANIC"" uses P and also has N and C. However, note: we haven't tested P, L, V, D, etc.

Is ""PANIC"" valid? Yes, meaning it's a word? Yes.

We can also consider words that put I at position 5.

Example: ""TOPAZI""? Not 5 letters.

""TAXI"" -> too short.

""HAWAI"" -> not a word.

""KIOSK"" -> second letter is I? Not A.

It's hard to find words ending with I that have second letter A? Consider: ""QADIS"", but that is obscure? Also, we avoid R,S,E.

Common words? Maybe ""LATIN"": L A T I N -> that has I at position 4? Positions: 1=L, 2=A, 3=T, 4=I, 5=N -> not position 5.

Position 5: I don't know. ""TABIS"", ""BANAI"", but obscure.

I think putting I at position 4 is easier.

Another word: ""DAILY"", but second letter A? D A I L Y -> I is at position 3? And that fails because in our feedback, the guess RAISE had I at position 3 and it was marked as '-' so I is not at position 3. Therefore, we must not guess I at position 3.

So if we guess ""DAILY"", we would have I at position 3, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

So our guess must avoid putting I at position 3.

Therefore, only positions 1,4,5 for I.

Since position 1 with I and A at 2 is hard, we focus on 4 or 5.

But position 5 is harder to find common words.

So back to position 4: 
- MANIC: uses M, N, C
- PANIC: uses P, N, C
- VALID: uses V, L, D

Which letters are more common? Let's see in 5-letter words.

Also, we can think about covering vowels: we know E is out, so vowels are A,I, and possibly O, U? But we haven't tested O,U.

In VALID, we test V (consonant), L, D and already known A and I.

In MANIC, we test M, N, C.

N is a common letter.

But note: in ""RAISE"", we had three vowels: A, I, E and they were one correct (A), one present (I), and one absent (E). So we don't have O or U yet.

Testing U or O might be useful.

So consider: ""GAUDY"" second letter A? G A U D Y -> but no I? We need to include I.

""OUIJA""? Not valid? Also, we need second letter A? O A? Words starting with OA? Not second letter A.

Another idea: put I at position 5? And test O or U? 

For example: ""BANJO"" -> second letter A? B A N J O -> but no I? And O is tested. However, we don't have I? We have to include I because we know the word contains I.

So we must include I.

Therefore, we need a word that has I and has second letter A, and we put I in position 4 or 5.

Perhaps ""AUDIO"": but that has A at first? Not second. We need second letter A.

So let's search for words that have second letter A and contain I, and have I at position 4 or 5.

Common words:
- MANIA: as before
- PANIC
- RADII (excluded by R)
- LATIN: which is L A T I N -> I at position 4. And no R or S or E? Letters: L,A,T,I,N -> none of R,S,E. So that's good.

""LATIN"": L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, N at 5.

Then it tests L, T, N.

This also tests T, which is common.

Similarly, ""MATIN"" might be valid? But let's stick to common words.

So options: LATIN, PANIC, MANIC, VALID.

Among these, LATIN tests L and T (and N), PANIC tests P,N,C, MANIC tests M,N,C, VALID tests V,L,D.

What about testing O? Or U? But we don't have a candidate that includes O or U and fits.

Another possibility: ""CAVIL"": C A V I L -> I at position 4? Positions: 1=C, 2=A, 3=V, 4=I, 5=L. And letters: C,V,L? and the I at 4. Avoids R,S,E.

So ""CAVIL"" tests C, V, L.

But note: ""VALID"" tests V,L,D and ""CAVIL"" tests C,V,L. The latter tests fewer new letters? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Therefore, each of these tests three new letters.

I think any of these would be fine.

I'll go with ""MANIC"" because M and N are common.

Alternatively, ""PANIC"" has P and N and C.

But PANIC is also a very common word in Wordle.

To avoid potential duplication early on, let's pick one that tests letters that are more common.

Another idea: ""ADIEU"" was not possible because second letter A? A D? Then second letter is D? Not A. And also E excluded.

So not.

Therefore, let me choose ""LATIN"". 

Why ""LATIN""? Because it tests L,T,N. T is a very common consonant.

So pattern: L A T I N

We know:
- Position 2 is A.
- Position 4 is I? But wait, we don't know if I is at position 4 or not. We are guessing it at 4.

Alternative: perhaps a word that has I at position 1? Even though it is less common, we might rule out that possibility quickly.

For example, ""IDEAL"" -> but I at position 1 and second letter D? Not A? No. We need second letter A.

So impossible? Unless the word starts with I and has A at position 2? Then it would be ""I A _ _ _"". Words: IAMBS? Not common. IANTHUS? Too long. So rare. Not worth it.

Therefore, it's safe to assume I is not at position 1? Or not? Actually, we should not assume.

But since we cannot find a common word, we'll skip position 1.

Therefore, I decide to use ""MANIC"": M A N I C

Reasoning: 
- We get to test M, N, and C.
- If we get any ✓ in new positions, we learn about correct letters and positions.
- Also, if I is at position 4, we get feedback for I at 4.

If I is not at 4, we might get '-' for I somewhere else? But we guessed I at 4, if it's not there, and the word has I (which we know) then it gets '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. Then we will know that I is at position 5? Then we can target that in the next guess.

Similarly, for other letters.

So I think ""MANIC"" is a reasonable guess.

If we get very positive feedback, we might guess the word in next try.

Therefore, let's go with: MANIC.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, S, and E are not in the word (marked x).
- A is correct and in position 2 (marked ✓).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked -), so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

For the second guess:
- Must include A in position 2 to retain the known correct position.
- Must include I in a position where it might be present (positions 1, 4, or 5) but avoid position 3 since it's confirmed incorrect.
- Avoid using R, S, and E, as they are eliminated.
- Aim to test new common consonants to gather more information.

The word ""MANIC"" is chosen because:
- It fits the criteria: second letter is A (position 2) and includes I in position 4.
- It tests new letters M, N, and C, which are common consonants.
- It avoids the excluded characters R, S, E.
- Position 4 for I helps narrow down the placement—if I is not in position 4, the feedback will indicate if it should be moved to position 1 or 5 instead.

<guess>MANIC</guess>",MANIC,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the second letter)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So from this feedback, we know:
- The word has the letter 'A' in the second position.
- The word contains the letter 'I', but not in the third position (since that's where we guessed it).
- The letters R, S, E are not in the word.

Also note: Since R, S, E are not in the word, we must avoid using them in future guesses.

Now, we have to make a second guess. We know the second letter is 'A'. We also know that the word contains 'I' somewhere else.

We have 5 positions: [1,2,3,4,5] and we know position 2 is 'A'.

Since 'I' is in the word but not at position 3, it must be at position 1, 4, or 5.

We also know that R, S, E are excluded.

We should try to choose a word that:

- Includes 'I' in one of the positions 1,4,5, but not 3 (since we know it's not at 3).
- Avoids R, S, E.

Additionally, we can try to include other common letters to get more information.

Possible common letters that we haven't tested: there are many, but we have eliminated R, S, E. So let's avoid those.

Option 2: I at position 4 -> pattern: __A I _? (with no R,S,E). For example: words that have third letter something, then fourth letter I, and fifth letter something.

Option 3: I at position 5 -> pattern: __A _ I (with no R,S,E).

Also, we can test other vowels? But we know E is excluded, and we have A and I. The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but often.

But note: we have excluded E, so we might avoid E.

We also know that the word cannot have duplicate letters? Not necessarily. The rules don't say. So there might be duplicates, but we haven't encountered any.

Let's look for words that satisfy:
- Second letter 'A'
- No R, S, E
- Include the letter 'I' in position 4 or 5.

Plus use letters that are common to maximize information.

Try words with I at position 4: ? A ? I

For example:
- The fourth letter is I, so pattern: [a letter] A [a letter] I [a letter]

Examples: 
  ""HAVOC"" -> but sixth letter? No, 5 letters. H A V O C? That has no I.

  ""MANIC"": M A N I C -> This has 'I' at position 4? Positions: 1=M, 2=A, 3=N, 4=I, 5=C -> yes.

Does ""MANIC"" contain any of the excluded letters? R, S, E? No. So it's good.

But note: we haven't tested M, N, C. Also, this word uses M, N, C which are common.

Alternatively, consider I at position 5: pattern: ? A ? ? I

Example: ""TOPAZ"" -> T O P A Z? No, second letter O? We need second letter A.

Actually: the word must have second letter A and last letter I? So pattern: [letter] A [letter] [letter] I

Examples: ""RADII"" -> but R is excluded, so no. ""TAPIR"": T A P I R -> but 'I' is at position 4? Then position 5 is R -> R is excluded, so invalid.

""MANIA"": M A N I A -> this has I at position 4? Positions: 1=M, 2=A, 3=N, 4=I, 5=A. So I at 4? But note: this word has duplicate A? That's possible. But is it valid? And letters: M, A, N, I, A. No R,S,E. So valid.

But with ""MANIA"", we test M, A, N, I. We already know A and I are present, so we are testing M and N and also the positions.

Another option: ""CAULK"" -> but no I.

""VALID"": V A L I D -> I at position 4? Positions: 1=V, 2=A, 3=L, 4=I, 5=D -> yes, and no R,S,E.

""RAPID"" -> R is excluded.

""SAVIN"" -> S excluded and also S at the start? But S is excluded.

So among the options: 
- MANIC: M at 1, A at 2 (known), N at 3, I at 4, C at 5. Tests M,N,C.
- MANIA: M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, I at 4, A at 5. Tests M,N (duplicate A but that's okay).
- VALID: V at 1, A at 2, L at 3, I at 4, D at 5. Tests V,L,D.

Which one gives more information? We want to test more new letters.

Note: ""MANIC"" and ""MANIA"" both test M and N. But MANIC tests C (less common) and MANIA ends with A (which we already know A is present, so duplicate might be redundant? Not necessarily, because if the word has two A's, then we need to know).

We also must consider that the word might have two A's? Since A is in position 2 and we see A at the end, we would get feedback about that.

But in MANIA, if the word doesn't have A at the end, then the fifth letter will be marked x or -. But here we are guessing A at fifth, so if it's not present, we'll get x for that A, meaning no duplicate A? Wait no: if the word has only one A and we guess A at fifth, we might get '-' if A is elsewhere? But we know A is at second already. So if the word has only one A and it's at second, then guessing A at fifth would mark as x because it's not in the word elsewhere. Then we would know no duplicate.

Similarly, if we get '-' at fifth for A? Then that means A would appear twice? But if the word already has A at position 2, and we guess A at fifth, then if there is a second A, we might get '-'? Only if that second A is not at position 5? Because position 5 is wrong then.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe we should pick a word that avoids duplicates to reduce complexity.

Let's look for words without repeated letters.

""VALID"": V A L I D -> no duplicates. And letters V, L, D are new.

""PANIC"": P A N I C -> no duplicates? P, A, N, I, C. But A and I are repeated? No, each letter is distinct.

Similarly, ""MANIC"" also distinct: M, A, N, I, C.

""VALID"" is another distinct letter word.

But ""PANIC"" uses P and also has N and C. However, note: we haven't tested P, L, V, D, etc.

Is ""PANIC"" valid? Yes, meaning it's a word? Yes.

We can also consider words that put I at position 5.

Example: ""TOPAZI""? Not 5 letters.

""TAXI"" -> too short.

""HAWAI"" -> not a word.

""KIOSK"" -> second letter is I? Not A.

It's hard to find words ending with I that have second letter A? Consider: ""QADIS"", but that is obscure? Also, we avoid R,S,E.

Common words? Maybe ""LATIN"": L A T I N -> that has I at position 4? Positions: 1=L, 2=A, 3=T, 4=I, 5=N -> not position 5.

Position 5: I don't know. ""TABIS"", ""BANAI"", but obscure.

I think putting I at position 4 is easier.

Another word: ""DAILY"", but second letter A? D A I L Y -> I is at position 3? And that fails because in our feedback, the guess RAISE had I at position 3 and it was marked as '-' so I is not at position 3. Therefore, we must not guess I at position 3.

So if we guess ""DAILY"", we would have I at position 3, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

So our guess must avoid putting I at position 3.

Therefore, only positions 1,4,5 for I.

Since position 1 with I and A at 2 is hard, we focus on 4 or 5.

But position 5 is harder to find common words.

So back to position 4: 
- MANIC: uses M, N, C
- PANIC: uses P, N, C
- VALID: uses V, L, D

Which letters are more common? Let's see in 5-letter words.

Also, we can think about covering vowels: we know E is out, so vowels are A,I, and possibly O, U? But we haven't tested O,U.

In VALID, we test V (consonant), L, D and already known A and I.

In MANIC, we test M, N, C.

N is a common letter.

But note: in ""RAISE"", we had three vowels: A, I, E and they were one correct (A), one present (I), and one absent (E). So we don't have O or U yet.

Testing U or O might be useful.

So consider: ""GAUDY"" second letter A? G A U D Y -> but no I? We need to include I.

""OUIJA""? Not valid? Also, we need second letter A? O A? Words starting with OA? Not second letter A.

Another idea: put I at position 5? And test O or U? 

For example: ""BANJO"" -> second letter A? B A N J O -> but no I? And O is tested. However, we don't have I? We have to include I because we know the word contains I.

So we must include I.

Therefore, we need a word that has I and has second letter A, and we put I in position 4 or 5.

Perhaps ""AUDIO"": but that has A at first? Not second. We need second letter A.

So let's search for words that have second letter A and contain I, and have I at position 4 or 5.

Common words:
- MANIA: as before
- PANIC
- RADII (excluded by R)
- LATIN: which is L A T I N -> I at position 4. And no R or S or E? Letters: L,A,T,I,N -> none of R,S,E. So that's good.

""LATIN"": L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, N at 5.

Then it tests L, T, N.

This also tests T, which is common.

Similarly, ""MATIN"" might be valid? But let's stick to common words.

So options: LATIN, PANIC, MANIC, VALID.

Among these, LATIN tests L and T (and N), PANIC tests P,N,C, MANIC tests M,N,C, VALID tests V,L,D.

What about testing O? Or U? But we don't have a candidate that includes O or U and fits.

Another possibility: ""CAVIL"": C A V I L -> I at position 4? Positions: 1=C, 2=A, 3=V, 4=I, 5=L. And letters: C,V,L? and the I at 4. Avoids R,S,E.

So ""CAVIL"" tests C, V, L.

But note: ""VALID"" tests V,L,D and ""CAVIL"" tests C,V,L. The latter tests fewer new letters? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Therefore, each of these tests three new letters.

I think any of these would be fine.

I'll go with ""MANIC"" because M and N are common.

Alternatively, ""PANIC"" has P and N and C.

But PANIC is also a very common word in Wordle.

To avoid potential duplication early on, let's pick one that tests letters that are more common.

Another idea: ""ADIEU"" was not possible because second letter A? A D? Then second letter is D? Not A. And also E excluded.

So not.

Therefore, let me choose ""LATIN"". 

Why ""LATIN""? Because it tests L,T,N. T is a very common consonant.

So pattern: L A T I N

We know:
- Position 2 is A.
- Position 4 is I? But wait, we don't know if I is at position 4 or not. We are guessing it at 4.

Alternative: perhaps a word that has I at position 1? Even though it is less common, we might rule out that possibility quickly.

For example, ""IDEAL"" -> but I at position 1 and second letter D? Not A? No. We need second letter A.

So impossible? Unless the word starts with I and has A at position 2? Then it would be ""I A _ _ _"". Words: IAMBS? Not common. IANTHUS? Too long. So rare. Not worth it.

Therefore, it's safe to assume I is not at position 1? Or not? Actually, we should not assume.

But since we cannot find a common word, we'll skip position 1.

Therefore, I decide to use ""MANIC"": M A N I C

Reasoning: 
- We get to test M, N, and C.
- If we get any ✓ in new positions, we learn about correct letters and positions.
- Also, if I is at position 4, we get feedback for I at 4.

If I is not at 4, we might get '-' for I somewhere else? But we guessed I at 4, if it's not there, and the word has I (which we know) then it gets '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. Then we will know that I is at position 5? Then we can target that in the next guess.

Similarly, for other letters.

So I think ""MANIC"" is a reasonable guess.

If we get very positive feedback, we might guess the word in next try.

Therefore, let's go with: MANIC.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, S, and E are not in the word (marked x).
- A is correct and in position 2 (marked ✓).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked -), so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

For the second guess:
- Must include A in position 2 to retain the known correct position.
- Must include I in a position where it might be present (positions 1, 4, or 5) but avoid position 3 since it's confirmed incorrect.
- Avoid using R, S, and E, as they are eliminated.
- Aim to test new common consonants to gather more information.

The word ""MANIC"" is chosen because:
- It fits the criteria: second letter is A (position 2) and includes I in position 4.
- It tests new letters M, N, and C, which are common consonants.
- It avoids the excluded characters R, S, E.
- Position 4 for I helps narrow down the placement—if I is not in position 4, the feedback will indicate if it should be moved to position 1 or 5 instead.",Guess 2: MANIC -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) N(x) I(✓) C(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet.
 We want a starting word that has a good mix of common letters and covers multiple possibilities.
 Common starting words in games like Wordle often use words with common vowels and consonants to maximize information.

 A popular choice is ""CRANE"" because it contains common letters: C, R, A, N, E. 
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"" are also good options.

 However, note that the word must be a valid English word. 

 Let's choose ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). 
 This may help in identifying or eliminating several letters.

 But note: the problem states that the feedback will tell us:
   ✓ : correct letter and position
   - : letter in word but wrong position
   x : letter not in word

 Therefore, let's begin with ""RAISE"".

 So the first guess: RAISEIn this first guess, since there is no prior feedback, the goal is to maximize information by choosing a word with common letters. ""RAISE"" is an effective starting word because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- These letters frequently appear in English words, increasing the chances of getting useful feedback about their presence and positions.
- The feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(-) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the second letter)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So from this feedback, we know:
- The word has the letter 'A' in the second position.
- The word contains the letter 'I', but not in the third position (since that's where we guessed it).
- The letters R, S, E are not in the word.

Also note: Since R, S, E are not in the word, we must avoid using them in future guesses.

Now, we have to make a second guess. We know the second letter is 'A'. We also know that the word contains 'I' somewhere else.

We have 5 positions: [1,2,3,4,5] and we know position 2 is 'A'.

Since 'I' is in the word but not at position 3, it must be at position 1, 4, or 5.

We also know that R, S, E are excluded.

We should try to choose a word that:
- Has 'A' as the second letter.
- Includes 'I' in one of the positions 1,4,5, but not 3 (since we know it's not at 3).
- Avoids R, S, E.

Additionally, we can try to include other common letters to get more information.

Possible common letters that we haven't tested: there are many, but we have eliminated R, S, E. So let's avoid those.

We might consider letters like T, N, O, L, U, D, C, H, M, etc.

But note: we have only tried one word so far, so we don't know about many letters.

We know the word has an 'I', so let's try to cover other vowels and consonants.

One strategy is to try a word that has 'I' in a possible position (i.e., position 1,4, or 5) and also tests other common letters.

Also, we must not use R, S, E.

Let's think of words that have:
- Position 2: 'A'
- And one of: I at position 1, I at position 4, or I at position 5.

We can also consider that if we put I at position 1, then we must test a word starting with I. But note, we don't know if I is at position 1 or not. Similarly for 4 and 5.

Alternatively, we can try to put I in position 4 or 5 to see if it fits there, while testing new letters.

But note: we have limited options because we must avoid R, S, E.

Let's list some words that fit:

Option 1: I at position 1 -> words starting with I, second letter A.
  Example: ""IA__?"" - but we need a 5-letter word. Words like: IAMBI, but that might be obscure. More common: I could think of ""INLAW"", but let's check letters:
    INLAW: I at position 1, N at 2? Wait second letter must be A, so not.

We need second letter A. So words with pattern: [letter]A[letter][letter][letter] and the first letter can be I? But then the word would be ""IA___"". There aren't many common words starting with ""IA"". Examples: IAMBI (uncommon), IAMBS (uncommon). Probably not good.

Option 2: I at position 4 -> pattern: __A I _? (with no R,S,E). For example: words that have third letter something, then fourth letter I, and fifth letter something.

Option 3: I at position 5 -> pattern: __A _ I (with no R,S,E).

Also, we can test other vowels? But we know E is excluded, and we have A and I. The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but often.

But note: we have excluded E, so we might avoid E.

We also know that the word cannot have duplicate letters? Not necessarily. The rules don't say. So there might be duplicates, but we haven't encountered any.

Let's look for words that satisfy:
- Second letter 'A'
- No R, S, E
- Include the letter 'I' in position 4 or 5.

Plus use letters that are common to maximize information.

Try words with I at position 4: ? A ? I

For example:
- The fourth letter is I, so pattern: [a letter] A [a letter] I [a letter]

Examples: 
  ""HAVOC"" -> but sixth letter? No, 5 letters. H A V O C? That has no I.

  ""MANIC"": M A N I C -> This has 'I' at position 4? Positions: 1=M, 2=A, 3=N, 4=I, 5=C -> yes.

Does ""MANIC"" contain any of the excluded letters? R, S, E? No. So it's good.

But note: we haven't tested M, N, C. Also, this word uses M, N, C which are common.

Alternatively, consider I at position 5: pattern: ? A ? ? I

Example: ""TOPAZ"" -> T O P A Z? No, second letter O? We need second letter A.

Actually: the word must have second letter A and last letter I? So pattern: [letter] A [letter] [letter] I

Examples: ""RADII"" -> but R is excluded, so no. ""TAPIR"": T A P I R -> but 'I' is at position 4? Then position 5 is R -> R is excluded, so invalid.

""MANIA"": M A N I A -> this has I at position 4? Positions: 1=M, 2=A, 3=N, 4=I, 5=A. So I at 4? But note: this word has duplicate A? That's possible. But is it valid? And letters: M, A, N, I, A. No R,S,E. So valid.

But with ""MANIA"", we test M, A, N, I. We already know A and I are present, so we are testing M and N and also the positions.

Another option: ""CAULK"" -> but no I.

""VALID"": V A L I D -> I at position 4? Positions: 1=V, 2=A, 3=L, 4=I, 5=D -> yes, and no R,S,E.

""RAPID"" -> R is excluded.

""SAVIN"" -> S excluded and also S at the start? But S is excluded.

So among the options: 
- MANIC: M at 1, A at 2 (known), N at 3, I at 4, C at 5. Tests M,N,C.
- MANIA: M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, I at 4, A at 5. Tests M,N (duplicate A but that's okay).
- VALID: V at 1, A at 2, L at 3, I at 4, D at 5. Tests V,L,D.

Which one gives more information? We want to test more new letters.

Note: ""MANIC"" and ""MANIA"" both test M and N. But MANIC tests C (less common) and MANIA ends with A (which we already know A is present, so duplicate might be redundant? Not necessarily, because if the word has two A's, then we need to know).

We also must consider that the word might have two A's? Since A is in position 2 and we see A at the end, we would get feedback about that.

But in MANIA, if the word doesn't have A at the end, then the fifth letter will be marked x or -. But here we are guessing A at fifth, so if it's not present, we'll get x for that A, meaning no duplicate A? Wait no: if the word has only one A and we guess A at fifth, we might get '-' if A is elsewhere? But we know A is at second already. So if the word has only one A and it's at second, then guessing A at fifth would mark as x because it's not in the word elsewhere. Then we would know no duplicate.

Similarly, if we get '-' at fifth for A? Then that means A would appear twice? But if the word already has A at position 2, and we guess A at fifth, then if there is a second A, we might get '-'? Only if that second A is not at position 5? Because position 5 is wrong then.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe we should pick a word that avoids duplicates to reduce complexity.

Let's look for words without repeated letters.

""VALID"": V A L I D -> no duplicates. And letters V, L, D are new.

""PANIC"": P A N I C -> no duplicates? P, A, N, I, C. But A and I are repeated? No, each letter is distinct.

Similarly, ""MANIC"" also distinct: M, A, N, I, C.

""VALID"" is another distinct letter word.

But ""PANIC"" uses P and also has N and C. However, note: we haven't tested P, L, V, D, etc.

Is ""PANIC"" valid? Yes, meaning it's a word? Yes.

We can also consider words that put I at position 5.

Example: ""TOPAZI""? Not 5 letters.

""TAXI"" -> too short.

""HAWAI"" -> not a word.

""KIOSK"" -> second letter is I? Not A.

It's hard to find words ending with I that have second letter A? Consider: ""QADIS"", but that is obscure? Also, we avoid R,S,E.

Common words? Maybe ""LATIN"": L A T I N -> that has I at position 4? Positions: 1=L, 2=A, 3=T, 4=I, 5=N -> not position 5.

Position 5: I don't know. ""TABIS"", ""BANAI"", but obscure.

I think putting I at position 4 is easier.

Another word: ""DAILY"", but second letter A? D A I L Y -> I is at position 3? And that fails because in our feedback, the guess RAISE had I at position 3 and it was marked as '-' so I is not at position 3. Therefore, we must not guess I at position 3.

So if we guess ""DAILY"", we would have I at position 3, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

So our guess must avoid putting I at position 3.

Therefore, only positions 1,4,5 for I.

Since position 1 with I and A at 2 is hard, we focus on 4 or 5.

But position 5 is harder to find common words.

So back to position 4: 
- MANIC: uses M, N, C
- PANIC: uses P, N, C
- VALID: uses V, L, D

Which letters are more common? Let's see in 5-letter words.

Also, we can think about covering vowels: we know E is out, so vowels are A,I, and possibly O, U? But we haven't tested O,U.

In VALID, we test V (consonant), L, D and already known A and I.

In MANIC, we test M, N, C.

N is a common letter.

But note: in ""RAISE"", we had three vowels: A, I, E and they were one correct (A), one present (I), and one absent (E). So we don't have O or U yet.

Testing U or O might be useful.

So consider: ""GAUDY"" second letter A? G A U D Y -> but no I? We need to include I.

""OUIJA""? Not valid? Also, we need second letter A? O A? Words starting with OA? Not second letter A.

Another idea: put I at position 5? And test O or U? 

For example: ""BANJO"" -> second letter A? B A N J O -> but no I? And O is tested. However, we don't have I? We have to include I because we know the word contains I.

So we must include I.

Therefore, we need a word that has I and has second letter A, and we put I in position 4 or 5.

Perhaps ""AUDIO"": but that has A at first? Not second. We need second letter A.

So let's search for words that have second letter A and contain I, and have I at position 4 or 5.

Common words:
- MANIA: as before
- PANIC
- RADII (excluded by R)
- LATIN: which is L A T I N -> I at position 4. And no R or S or E? Letters: L,A,T,I,N -> none of R,S,E. So that's good.

""LATIN"": L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, N at 5.

Then it tests L, T, N.

This also tests T, which is common.

Similarly, ""MATIN"" might be valid? But let's stick to common words.

So options: LATIN, PANIC, MANIC, VALID.

Among these, LATIN tests L and T (and N), PANIC tests P,N,C, MANIC tests M,N,C, VALID tests V,L,D.

What about testing O? Or U? But we don't have a candidate that includes O or U and fits.

Another possibility: ""CAVIL"": C A V I L -> I at position 4? Positions: 1=C, 2=A, 3=V, 4=I, 5=L. And letters: C,V,L? and the I at 4. Avoids R,S,E.

So ""CAVIL"" tests C, V, L.

But note: ""VALID"" tests V,L,D and ""CAVIL"" tests C,V,L. The latter tests fewer new letters? We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Therefore, each of these tests three new letters.

I think any of these would be fine.

I'll go with ""MANIC"" because M and N are common.

Alternatively, ""PANIC"" has P and N and C.

But PANIC is also a very common word in Wordle.

To avoid potential duplication early on, let's pick one that tests letters that are more common.

Another idea: ""ADIEU"" was not possible because second letter A? A D? Then second letter is D? Not A. And also E excluded.

So not.

Therefore, let me choose ""LATIN"". 

Why ""LATIN""? Because it tests L,T,N. T is a very common consonant.

So pattern: L A T I N

We know:
- Position 2 is A.
- Position 4 is I? But wait, we don't know if I is at position 4 or not. We are guessing it at 4.

Alternative: perhaps a word that has I at position 1? Even though it is less common, we might rule out that possibility quickly.

For example, ""IDEAL"" -> but I at position 1 and second letter D? Not A? No. We need second letter A.

So impossible? Unless the word starts with I and has A at position 2? Then it would be ""I A _ _ _"". Words: IAMBS? Not common. IANTHUS? Too long. So rare. Not worth it.

Therefore, it's safe to assume I is not at position 1? Or not? Actually, we should not assume.

But since we cannot find a common word, we'll skip position 1.

Therefore, I decide to use ""MANIC"": M A N I C

Reasoning: 
- We get to test M, N, and C.
- If we get any ✓ in new positions, we learn about correct letters and positions.
- Also, if I is at position 4, we get feedback for I at 4.

If I is not at 4, we might get '-' for I somewhere else? But we guessed I at 4, if it's not there, and the word has I (which we know) then it gets '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. Then we will know that I is at position 5? Then we can target that in the next guess.

Similarly, for other letters.

So I think ""MANIC"" is a reasonable guess.

If we get very positive feedback, we might guess the word in next try.

Therefore, let's go with: MANIC.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, S, and E are not in the word (marked x).
- A is correct and in position 2 (marked ✓).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked -), so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

For the second guess:
- Must include A in position 2 to retain the known correct position.
- Must include I in a position where it might be present (positions 1, 4, or 5) but avoid position 3 since it's confirmed incorrect.
- Avoid using R, S, and E, as they are eliminated.
- Aim to test new common consonants to gather more information.

The word ""MANIC"" is chosen because:
- It fits the criteria: second letter is A (position 2) and includes I in position 4.
- It tests new letters M, N, and C, which are common consonants.
- It avoids the excluded characters R, S, E.
- Position 4 for I helps narrow down the placement—if I is not in position 4, the feedback will indicate if it should be moved to position 1 or 5 instead.

Since it\'s the first guess, we don\'t have any feedback yet.\n We want a starting word that has a good mix of common letters and covers multiple possibilities.\n Common starting words in games like Wordle often use words with common vowels and consonants to maximize information.\n\n A popular choice is ""CRANE"" because it contains common letters: C, R, A, N, E. \n Alternatively, ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"" are also good options.\n\n However, note that the word must be a valid English word. \n\n Let\'s choose ""RAISE"" because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). \n This may help in identifying or eliminating several letters.\n\n But note: the problem states that the feedback will tell us:\n   ✓ : correct letter and position\n   - : letter in word but wrong position\n   x : letter not in word\n\n Therefore, let\'s begin with ""RAISE"".\n\n So the first guess: RAISEIn this first guess, since there is no prior feedback, the goal is to maximize information by choosing a word with common letters. ""RAISE"" is an effective starting word because:\n- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n- These letters frequently appear in English words, increasing the chances of getting useful feedback about their presence and positions.\n- The feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the second letter)\n- I: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo from this feedback, we know:\n- The word has the letter \'A\' in the second position.\n- The word contains the letter \'I\', but not in the third position (since that\'s where we guessed it).\n- The letters R, S, E are not in the word.\n\nAlso note: Since R, S, E are not in the word, we must avoid using them in future guesses.\n\nNow, we have to make a second guess. We know the second letter is \'A\'. We also know that the word contains \'I\' somewhere else.\n\nWe have 5 positions: [1,2,3,4,5] and we know position 2 is \'A\'.\n\nSince \'I\' is in the word but not at position 3, it must be at position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nWe also know that R, S, E are excluded.\n\nWe should try to choose a word that:\n- Has \'A\' as the second letter.\n- Includes \'I\' in one of the positions 1,4,5, but not 3 (since we know it\'s not at 3).\n- Avoids R, S, E.\n\nAdditionally, we can try to include other common letters to get more information.\n\nPossible common letters that we haven\'t tested: there are many, but we have eliminated R, S, E. So let\'s avoid those.\n\nWe might consider letters like T, N, O, L, U, D, C, H, M, etc.\n\nBut note: we have only tried one word so far, so we don\'t know about many letters.\n\nWe know the word has an \'I\', so let\'s try to cover other vowels and consonants.\n\nOne strategy is to try a word that has \'I\' in a possible position (i.e., position 1,4, or 5) and also tests other common letters.\n\nAlso, we must not use R, S, E.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have:\n- Position 2: \'A\'\n- And one of: I at position 1, I at position 4, or I at position 5.\n\nWe can also consider that if we put I at position 1, then we must test a word starting with I. But note, we don\'t know if I is at position 1 or not. Similarly for 4 and 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put I in position 4 or 5 to see if it fits there, while testing new letters.\n\nBut note: we have limited options because we must avoid R, S, E.\n\nLet\'s list some words that fit:\n\nOption 1: I at position 1 -> words starting with I, second letter A.\n  Example: ""IA__?"" - but we need a 5-letter word. Words like: IAMBI, but that might be obscure. More common: I could think of ""INLAW"", but let\'s check letters:\n    INLAW: I at position 1, N at 2? Wait second letter must be A, so not.\n\nWe need second letter A. So words with pattern: [letter]A[letter][letter][letter] and the first letter can be I? But then the word would be ""IA___"". There aren\'t many common words starting with ""IA"". Examples: IAMBI (uncommon), IAMBS (uncommon). Probably not good.\n\nOption 2: I at position 4 -> pattern: __A I _? (with no R,S,E). For example: words that have third letter something, then fourth letter I, and fifth letter something.\n\nOption 3: I at position 5 -> pattern: __A _ I (with no R,S,E).\n\nAlso, we can test other vowels? But we know E is excluded, and we have A and I. The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but often.\n\nBut note: we have excluded E, so we might avoid E.\n\nWe also know that the word cannot have duplicate letters? Not necessarily. The rules don\'t say. So there might be duplicates, but we haven\'t encountered any.\n\nLet\'s look for words that satisfy:\n- Second letter \'A\'\n- No R, S, E\n- Include the letter \'I\' in position 4 or 5.\n\nPlus use letters that are common to maximize information.\n\nTry words with I at position 4: ? A ? I\n\nFor example:\n- The fourth letter is I, so pattern: [a letter] A [a letter] I [a letter]\n\nExamples: \n  ""HAVOC"" -> but sixth letter? No, 5 letters. H A V O C? That has no I.\n\n  ""MANIC"": M A N I C -> This has \'I\' at position 4? Positions: 1=M, 2=A, 3=N, 4=I, 5=C -> yes.\n\nDoes ""MANIC"" contain any of the excluded letters? R, S, E? No. So it\'s good.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested M, N, C. Also, this word uses M, N, C which are common.\n\nAlternatively, consider I at position 5: pattern: ? A ? ? I\n\nExample: ""TOPAZ"" -> T O P A Z? No, second letter O? We need second letter A.\n\nActually: the word must have second letter A and last letter I? So pattern: [letter] A [letter] [letter] I\n\nExamples: ""RADII"" -> but R is excluded, so no. ""TAPIR"": T A P I R -> but \'I\' is at position 4? Then position 5 is R -> R is excluded, so invalid.\n\n""MANIA"": M A N I A -> this has I at position 4? Positions: 1=M, 2=A, 3=N, 4=I, 5=A. So I at 4? But note: this word has duplicate A? That\'s possible. But is it valid? And letters: M, A, N, I, A. No R,S,E. So valid.\n\nBut with ""MANIA"", we test M, A, N, I. We already know A and I are present, so we are testing M and N and also the positions.\n\nAnother option: ""CAULK"" -> but no I.\n\n""VALID"": V A L I D -> I at position 4? Positions: 1=V, 2=A, 3=L, 4=I, 5=D -> yes, and no R,S,E.\n\n""RAPID"" -> R is excluded.\n\n""SAVIN"" -> S excluded and also S at the start? But S is excluded.\n\nSo among the options: \n- MANIC: M at 1, A at 2 (known), N at 3, I at 4, C at 5. Tests M,N,C.\n- MANIA: M at 1, A at 2, N at 3, I at 4, A at 5. Tests M,N (duplicate A but that\'s okay).\n- VALID: V at 1, A at 2, L at 3, I at 4, D at 5. Tests V,L,D.\n\nWhich one gives more information? We want to test more new letters.\n\nNote: ""MANIC"" and ""MANIA"" both test M and N. But MANIC tests C (less common) and MANIA ends with A (which we already know A is present, so duplicate might be redundant? Not necessarily, because if the word has two A\'s, then we need to know).\n\nWe also must consider that the word might have two A\'s? Since A is in position 2 and we see A at the end, we would get feedback about that.\n\nBut in MANIA, if the word doesn\'t have A at the end, then the fifth letter will be marked x or -. But here we are guessing A at fifth, so if it\'s not present, we\'ll get x for that A, meaning no duplicate A? Wait no: if the word has only one A and we guess A at fifth, we might get \'-\' if A is elsewhere? But we know A is at second already. So if the word has only one A and it\'s at second, then guessing A at fifth would mark as x because it\'s not in the word elsewhere. Then we would know no duplicate.\n\nSimilarly, if we get \'-\' at fifth for A? Then that means A would appear twice? But if the word already has A at position 2, and we guess A at fifth, then if there is a second A, we might get \'-\'? Only if that second A is not at position 5? Because position 5 is wrong then.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe we should pick a word that avoids duplicates to reduce complexity.\n\nLet\'s look for words without repeated letters.\n\n""VALID"": V A L I D -> no duplicates. And letters V, L, D are new.\n\n""PANIC"": P A N I C -> no duplicates? P, A, N, I, C. But A and I are repeated? No, each letter is distinct.\n\nSimilarly, ""MANIC"" also distinct: M, A, N, I, C.\n\n""VALID"" is another distinct letter word.\n\nBut ""PANIC"" uses P and also has N and C. However, note: we haven\'t tested P, L, V, D, etc.\n\nIs ""PANIC"" valid? Yes, meaning it\'s a word? Yes.\n\nWe can also consider words that put I at position 5.\n\nExample: ""TOPAZI""? Not 5 letters.\n\n""TAXI"" -> too short.\n\n""HAWAI"" -> not a word.\n\n""KIOSK"" -> second letter is I? Not A.\n\nIt\'s hard to find words ending with I that have second letter A? Consider: ""QADIS"", but that is obscure? Also, we avoid R,S,E.\n\nCommon words? Maybe ""LATIN"": L A T I N -> that has I at position 4? Positions: 1=L, 2=A, 3=T, 4=I, 5=N -> not position 5.\n\nPosition 5: I don\'t know. ""TABIS"", ""BANAI"", but obscure.\n\nI think putting I at position 4 is easier.\n\nAnother word: ""DAILY"", but second letter A? D A I L Y -> I is at position 3? And that fails because in our feedback, the guess RAISE had I at position 3 and it was marked as \'-\' so I is not at position 3. Therefore, we must not guess I at position 3.\n\nSo if we guess ""DAILY"", we would have I at position 3, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.\n\nSo our guess must avoid putting I at position 3.\n\nTherefore, only positions 1,4,5 for I.\n\nSince position 1 with I and A at 2 is hard, we focus on 4 or 5.\n\nBut position 5 is harder to find common words.\n\nSo back to position 4: \n- MANIC: uses M, N, C\n- PANIC: uses P, N, C\n- VALID: uses V, L, D\n\nWhich letters are more common? Let\'s see in 5-letter words.\n\nAlso, we can think about covering vowels: we know E is out, so vowels are A,I, and possibly O, U? But we haven\'t tested O,U.\n\nIn VALID, we test V (consonant), L, D and already known A and I.\n\nIn MANIC, we test M, N, C.\n\nN is a common letter.\n\nBut note: in ""RAISE"", we had three vowels: A, I, E and they were one correct (A), one present (I), and one absent (E). So we don\'t have O or U yet.\n\nTesting U or O might be useful.\n\nSo consider: ""GAUDY"" second letter A? G A U D Y -> but no I? We need to include I.\n\n""OUIJA""? Not valid? Also, we need second letter A? O A? Words starting with OA? Not second letter A.\n\nAnother idea: put I at position 5? And test O or U? \n\nFor example: ""BANJO"" -> second letter A? B A N J O -> but no I? And O is tested. However, we don\'t have I? We have to include I because we know the word contains I.\n\nSo we must include I.\n\nTherefore, we need a word that has I and has second letter A, and we put I in position 4 or 5.\n\nPerhaps ""AUDIO"": but that has A at first? Not second. We need second letter A.\n\nSo let\'s search for words that have second letter A and contain I, and have I at position 4 or 5.\n\nCommon words:\n- MANIA: as before\n- PANIC\n- RADII (excluded by R)\n- LATIN: which is L A T I N -> I at position 4. And no R or S or E? Letters: L,A,T,I,N -> none of R,S,E. So that\'s good.\n\n""LATIN"": L at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, N at 5.\n\nThen it tests L, T, N.\n\nThis also tests T, which is common.\n\nSimilarly, ""MATIN"" might be valid? But let\'s stick to common words.\n\nSo options: LATIN, PANIC, MANIC, VALID.\n\nAmong these, LATIN tests L and T (and N), PANIC tests P,N,C, MANIC tests M,N,C, VALID tests V,L,D.\n\nWhat about testing O? Or U? But we don\'t have a candidate that includes O or U and fits.\n\nAnother possibility: ""CAVIL"": C A V I L -> I at position 4? Positions: 1=C, 2=A, 3=V, 4=I, 5=L. And letters: C,V,L? and the I at 4. Avoids R,S,E.\n\nSo ""CAVIL"" tests C, V, L.\n\nBut note: ""VALID"" tests V,L,D and ""CAVIL"" tests C,V,L. The latter tests fewer new letters? We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nTherefore, each of these tests three new letters.\n\nI think any of these would be fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""MANIC"" because M and N are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""PANIC"" has P and N and C.\n\nBut PANIC is also a very common word in Wordle.\n\nTo avoid potential duplication early on, let\'s pick one that tests letters that are more common.\n\nAnother idea: ""ADIEU"" was not possible because second letter A? A D? Then second letter is D? Not A. And also E excluded.\n\nSo not.\n\nTherefore, let me choose ""LATIN"". \n\nWhy ""LATIN""? Because it tests L,T,N. T is a very common consonant.\n\nSo pattern: L A T I N\n\nWe know:\n- Position 2 is A.\n- Position 4 is I? But wait, we don\'t know if I is at position 4 or not. We are guessing it at 4.\n\nAlternative: perhaps a word that has I at position 1? Even though it is less common, we might rule out that possibility quickly.\n\nFor example, ""IDEAL"" -> but I at position 1 and second letter D? Not A? No. We need second letter A.\n\nSo impossible? Unless the word starts with I and has A at position 2? Then it would be ""I A _ _ _"". Words: IAMBS? Not common. IANTHUS? Too long. So rare. Not worth it.\n\nTherefore, it\'s safe to assume I is not at position 1? Or not? Actually, we should not assume.\n\nBut since we cannot find a common word, we\'ll skip position 1.\n\nTherefore, I decide to use ""MANIC"": M A N I C\n\nReasoning: \n- We get to test M, N, and C.\n- If we get any ✓ in new positions, we learn about correct letters and positions.\n- Also, if I is at position 4, we get feedback for I at 4.\n\nIf I is not at 4, we might get \'-\' for I somewhere else? But we guessed I at 4, if it\'s not there, and the word has I (which we know) then it gets \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. Then we will know that I is at position 5? Then we can target that in the next guess.\n\nSimilarly, for other letters.\n\nSo I think ""MANIC"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nIf we get very positive feedback, we might guess the word in next try.\n\nTherefore, let\'s go with: MANIC.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, S, and E are not in the word (marked x).\n- A is correct and in position 2 (marked ✓).\n- I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked -), so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include A in position 2 to retain the known correct position.\n- Must include I in a position where it might be present (positions 1, 4, or 5) but avoid position 3 since it\'s confirmed incorrect.\n- Avoid using R, S, and E, as they are eliminated.\n- Aim to test new common consonants to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""MANIC"" is chosen because:\n- It fits the criteria: second letter is A (position 2) and includes I in position 4.\n- It tests new letters M, N, and C, which are common consonants.\n- It avoids the excluded characters R, S, E.\n- Position 4 for I helps narrow down the placement—if I is not in position 4, the feedback will indicate if it should be moved to position 1 or 5 instead.\n\n<guess>MANIC</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MANIC -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) N(x) I(✓) C(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: x → not in word
- A: ✓ → correct letter and correct position (position 2)
- I: - → in word but wrong position (not position 3, since guessed at 3)
- S: x → not in word
- E: x → not in word

So known so far:
- Position 2 is A.
- I is in the word but not at position 3 → so must be at position 1, 4, or 5.
- Letters R, S, E are absent.

Guess 2: MANIC
- M: ✓ → correct letter and correct position (position 1)
- A: ✓ → we already know, confirms position 2 is A.
- N: x → not in word
- I: ✓ → correct letter and correct position at position 4? But note: we guessed I at position 4 and got ✓, meaning I is indeed in position 4? But wait: in feedback we have I(✓) in position 4? And it was marked ✓.
- C: ✓ → correct letter and correct position at position 5? Because MANIC has positions: M(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), C(5). And I at 4 is ✓ and C at 5 is ✓.

Therefore, the feedback for MANIC:
- M at 1: ✓ → so position 1 is M? Actually, if M is at position 1 and we got ✓, then the word has M at position 1.
- Similarly, A at position 2: ✓ → which we already knew.
- N at 3: x → N is not in the word.
- I at 4: ✓ → so position 4 is I? Because we got ✓ for position 4? That means the letter at position 4 of the secret word is I.
- C at 5: ✓ → so position 5 is C.

But then the secret word would be: M _ A _ I _ C? With position 3 missing? Actually, the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

So based on Guess 2 feedback:
- Position 1: M (correct)
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 3: we guess N but it was wrong → so position 3 is something else, and N is not in the word
- Position 4: I (correct)
- Position 5"": C (correct)

So we know:
- The secret word has: M at 1, A at 2, ? at 3, I at 4, C at 5.
- The missing letter is position 3.
- We also know from Guess 1 that I is in the word (which is confirmed) and not at position 3? (But now we have I at position 4? So position 3 cannot be I? Which we already know because Letter N at position 3 was wrong? But we don't know what position 3 is.)

Moreover, from Guess 1: we confirmed that I is in the word? But now Guess 2 confirms position 4 is I? So that matches the I from Guess 1.

Also from Guess 2: we know that N is not in the word? And M is at position 1? But we didn't have M previously? So M is new and confirmed at 1.

Also: C is at position 5? And we didn't have C tested earlier? So C is confirmed at 5.

Now: the secret word pattern is: M A ? I C

We need to find a letter for position 3? And that letter cannot be N (since Guess 2 has N at position 3 marked x → meaning N is absent entirely? Because if it were elsewhere it would be marked '-'? And since we guessed N only at position 3 and it got x, that means N is not in the word.)

So: We need to fill position 3 with a letter. That letter must be from the remaining alphabet except:
- Excluded letters: R, S, E (from Guess 1)
- N excluded (from Guess 2)
- Also, note: we have used: M, A, I, C? And we know A and I appear? But A is at position 2? I at position 4? So the position 3 letter must be a letter that is not any of excluded or duplicated? Unless the word has duplication? We don't know.

Currently we have M at 1, A at 2, ? at 3, I at 4, C at 5? Could the word have duplicate letters? Possibly? But if a duplicate letter? For example, could A appear again? We don't see any duplication yet.

But note: we have tested one A at position 2? But we haven't tested other positions? So it's possible? However, let's see what we know.

The word must be M A ? I C? What are the common words? 

For example: MAGIC? That has G at position 3? But is that possible?

But in MAGIC: positions: M, A, G, I, C. 

Does MAGIC contain any excluded letter? R? No? S? No? E? No? N? No? So possible.

Another: MATIC? Meaning: something about matrix? But is MATIC a word? Not common.

Or MAXIC? Not a word.

MUSIC? But position 3 is U? But U is not excluded? But does it have S? No? S was excluded? Wait: Guess 1: S was marked x → so no S. MUSIC has S? So cannot.

MACAW? Second letter A? M A C A W? But that has C at position 3? Then positions: M(1), A(2), C(3), A(4), W(5) → but our feedback tells position 4 is I? And we have position 4 as I? So it must be M A ? I C? Meaning position 4 must be I? So MAGIC: M A G I C → yes.

What about MALIC? MALIC might not be a word? Malic acid? But MALIC is less common.

MAFIC? Geological term? Not very common.

MAJIC? Uncommon.

Therefore, MAGIC is the most common word? It fits: M A G I C.

But note: we must verify if G is allowed? We haven't tested G? Yes. And it's not excluded.

But note: we need to guess? This could be the word.

We have missed one possibility: could there be duplicate letters? For example, could the word be MAGIC? No duplication? What else? What about MAVIC? Less common.

Or MANIC? That was our second guess? But MANIC was guessed: M A N I C? But we got: position 3 was N and marked x? So MANIC is not the word. We tried that.

Now, position 3 must be a letter that is not N, not R,S,E.

Therefore, we can guess MAGIC? It is common and we get information? Or directly win?

But note: this is our third guess? We have to guess a word? MAGIC seems very likely.

Are there other options? What letters can position 3 be? We need an English word? The word must be valid.

Other words: M A T I C? But T is possible? MATIC? As in automatic? But not a standard word? Whereas MAGIC is valid.

MAYIC? Not a word.

MAZIC? Not a word.

Or with H: MAHIC? Not common.

Therefore, MAGIC is the best candidate.

Perhaps there might be other words: with other letters? Such as B? MABIC? Not a word. L? MALIC is uncommon. X? MAXIC? No. D? MADIC? Not common. F? MAFIC? Rare.

But MAGIC is a word and fits perfectly.

Also, note: from Guess 1: we guessed R A I S E → and I was marked as ""-"" meaning I is in the word but wrong position? And at that time, we guessed I at position 3? But actually, it turned out I was at position 4? So the ""-"" indicated it was present? And now we have I at 4? Which is consistent.

And no other constraints? So MAGIC should be guessed.

Therefore, for this guess, we choose MAGIC.

We'll see if we are correct.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first two guesses, we can deduce the following:

- From Guess 1 (RAISE):
  - R, S, E are absent from the word (marked x).
  - A is correct and in position 2 (marked ✓).
  - I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked -), so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

- From Guess 2 (MANIC):
  - M is correct and in position 1 (marked ✓).
  - A is correct in position 2 (again, marked ✓), which was already known.
  - N is absent from the word (marked x).
  - I is correct and in position 4 (marked ✓). This resolves the position uncertainty for I from Guess 1.
  - C is correct and in position 5 (marked ✓).

The secret word pattern is: Position 1: M, Position 2: A, Position 3: ?, Position 4: O, Position 5: C.  
Position 3 must be a letter not eliminated (not R, S, E, or N) and that forms a valid English word. Common words fitting this pattern include MAGIC, MATIC, or MALIC. Among these, MAGIC is the most common and likely candidate. Guessing MAGIC will either solve the word or provide further positioning clues.

<guess>MAGIC</guess>",MAGIC,"We have the feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: x → not in word
- A: ✓ → correct letter and correct position (position 2)
- I: - → in word but wrong position (not position 3, since guessed at 3)
- S: x → not in word
- E: x → not in word

So known so far:
- Position 2 is A.
- I is in the word but not at position 3 → so must be at position 1, 4, or 5.
- Letters R, S, E are absent.

Guess 2: MANIC
- M: ✓ → correct letter and correct position (position 1)
- A: ✓ → we already know, confirms position 2 is A.
- N: x → not in word
- I: ✓ → correct letter and correct position at position 4? But note: we guessed I at position 4 and got ✓, meaning I is indeed in position 4? But wait: in feedback we have I(✓) in position 4? And it was marked ✓.
- C: ✓ → correct letter and correct position at position 5? Because MANIC has positions: M(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), C(5). And I at 4 is ✓ and C at 5 is ✓.

Therefore, the feedback for MANIC:
- M at 1: ✓ → so position 1 is M? Actually, if M is at position 1 and we got ✓, then the word has M at position 1.
- Similarly, A at position 2: ✓ → which we already knew.
- N at 3: x → N is not in the word.
- I at 4: ✓ → so position 4 is I? Because we got ✓ for position 4? That means the letter at position 4 of the secret word is I.
- C at 5: ✓ → so position 5 is C.

But then the secret word would be: M _ A _ I _ C? With position 3 missing? Actually, the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

So based on Guess 2 feedback:
- Position 1: M (correct)
- Position 2: A (correct)
- Position 3: we guess N but it was wrong → so position 3 is something else, and N is not in the word
- Position 4: I (correct)
- Position 5"": C (correct)

So we know:
- The secret word has: M at 1, A at 2, ? at 3, I at 4, C at 5.
- The missing letter is position 3.
- We also know from Guess 1 that I is in the word (which is confirmed) and not at position 3? (But now we have I at position 4? So position 3 cannot be I? Which we already know because Letter N at position 3 was wrong? But we don't know what position 3 is.)

Moreover, from Guess 1: we confirmed that I is in the word? But now Guess 2 confirms position 4 is I? So that matches the I from Guess 1.

Also from Guess 2: we know that N is not in the word? And M is at position 1? But we didn't have M previously? So M is new and confirmed at 1.

Also: C is at position 5? And we didn't have C tested earlier? So C is confirmed at 5.

Now: the secret word pattern is: M A ? I C

We need to find a letter for position 3? And that letter cannot be N (since Guess 2 has N at position 3 marked x → meaning N is absent entirely? Because if it were elsewhere it would be marked '-'? And since we guessed N only at position 3 and it got x, that means N is not in the word.)

So: We need to fill position 3 with a letter. That letter must be from the remaining alphabet except:
- Excluded letters: R, S, E (from Guess 1)
- N excluded (from Guess 2)
- Also, note: we have used: M, A, I, C? And we know A and I appear? But A is at position 2? I at position 4? So the position 3 letter must be a letter that is not any of excluded or duplicated? Unless the word has duplication? We don't know.

Currently we have M at 1, A at 2, ? at 3, I at 4, C at 5? Could the word have duplicate letters? Possibly? But if a duplicate letter? For example, could A appear again? We don't see any duplication yet.

But note: we have tested one A at position 2? But we haven't tested other positions? So it's possible? However, let's see what we know.

The word must be M A ? I C? What are the common words? 

For example: MAGIC? That has G at position 3? But is that possible?

But in MAGIC: positions: M, A, G, I, C. 

Does MAGIC contain any excluded letter? R? No? S? No? E? No? N? No? So possible.

Another: MATIC? Meaning: something about matrix? But is MATIC a word? Not common.

Or MAXIC? Not a word.

MUSIC? But position 3 is U? But U is not excluded? But does it have S? No? S was excluded? Wait: Guess 1: S was marked x → so no S. MUSIC has S? So cannot.

MACAW? Second letter A? M A C A W? But that has C at position 3? Then positions: M(1), A(2), C(3), A(4), W(5) → but our feedback tells position 4 is I? And we have position 4 as I? So it must be M A ? I C? Meaning position 4 must be I? So MAGIC: M A G I C → yes.

What about MALIC? MALIC might not be a word? Malic acid? But MALIC is less common.

MAFIC? Geological term? Not very common.

MAJIC? Uncommon.

Therefore, MAGIC is the most common word? It fits: M A G I C.

But note: we must verify if G is allowed? We haven't tested G? Yes. And it's not excluded.

But note: we need to guess? This could be the word.

We have missed one possibility: could there be duplicate letters? For example, could the word be MAGIC? No duplication? What else? What about MAVIC? Less common.

Or MANIC? That was our second guess? But MANIC was guessed: M A N I C? But we got: position 3 was N and marked x? So MANIC is not the word. We tried that.

Now, position 3 must be a letter that is not N, not R,S,E.

Therefore, we can guess MAGIC? It is common and we get information? Or directly win?

But note: this is our third guess? We have to guess a word? MAGIC seems very likely.

Are there other options? What letters can position 3 be? We need an English word? The word must be valid.

Other words: M A T I C? But T is possible? MATIC? As in automatic? But not a standard word? Whereas MAGIC is valid.

MAYIC? Not a word.

MAZIC? Not a word.

Or with H: MAHIC? Not common.

Therefore, MAGIC is the best candidate.

Perhaps there might be other words: with other letters? Such as B? MABIC? Not a word. L? MALIC is uncommon. X? MAXIC? No. D? MADIC? Not common. F? MAFIC? Rare.

But MAGIC is a word and fits perfectly.

Also, note: from Guess 1: we guessed R A I S E → and I was marked as ""-"" meaning I is in the word but wrong position? And at that time, we guessed I at position 3? But actually, it turned out I was at position 4? So the ""-"" indicated it was present? And now we have I at 4? Which is consistent.

And no other constraints? So MAGIC should be guessed.

Therefore, for this guess, we choose MAGIC.

We'll see if we are correct.Based on the feedback from the first two guesses, we can deduce the following:

- From Guess 1 (RAISE):
  - R, S, E are absent from the word (marked x).
  - A is correct and in position 2 (marked ✓).
  - I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked -), so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

- From Guess 2 (MANIC):
  - M is correct and in position 1 (marked ✓).
  - A is correct in position 2 (again, marked ✓), which was already known.
  - N is absent from the word (marked x).
  - I is correct and in position 4 (marked ✓). This resolves the position uncertainty for I from Guess 1.
  - C is correct and in position 5 (marked ✓).

The secret word pattern is: Position 1: M, Position 2: A, Position 3: ?, Position 4: O, Position 5: C.  
Position 3 must be a letter not eliminated (not R, S, E, or N) and that forms a valid English word. Common words fitting this pattern include MAGIC, MATIC, or MALIC. Among these, MAGIC is the most common and likely candidate. Guessing MAGIC will either solve the word or provide further positioning clues.",Guess 3: MAGIC -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) G(✓) I(✓) C(✓),SUCCESS
