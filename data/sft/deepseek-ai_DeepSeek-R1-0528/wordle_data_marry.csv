We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words.
 According to various sources, the most common letters in English words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible and also try to have a mix of vowels and consonants.

 I recall that ""ROAST"" is a good starting word because it has:
   R, O, A, S, T
 These are all common letters.

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also popular: C, R, A, N, E.

 Another one is ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

 I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N) and all are common.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

 But note: the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Let me write it in the required format.

I need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to help identify letters in the secret word. 

After considering common starting words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" and ""ROAST,"" I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
- The letters C, R, A, N, and E are all high-frequency in English.
- This combination covers a broad range of possible matches, helping me narrow down the secret word efficiently with the first feedback.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". 
  Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the following properties:
- It is a 5-letter word.
- It contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
- The positions of R and A are not 2 and 3 respectively.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Does not contain C, N, or E (since they are not in the secret word).
- Includes R and A (to try to find their correct positions) and possibly other common letters.

We also want to try to place R and A in different positions than in the first guess (position 2 and 3).

Let's think about possible positions for R and A:
- R was in position 2 in ""crane"", so in the secret word, R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- A was in position 3 in ""crane"", so in the secret word, A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We should avoid using the letters C, N, E.

We can also try to include other common letters that haven't been tested yet. Common letters in English include: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

A good strategy is to try a word that has R and A in new positions and also tests other common letters.

Let me brainstorm some words that meet the criteria:
- Must include R and A (and not C, N, E).
- Let's try to put R in position 1 and A in position 4, for example.

Possible words:
- ""RADAR"": But this has two R's and two A's. Also, we know only one R and one A? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. The secret word might have duplicate letters? But in the example, the word ""BRISK"" has no duplicates. However, we cannot rule out duplicates. But to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates until we have evidence.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one R and one A as present (and in wrong positions). If there were duplicates, we might have seen more? Actually, the feedback only marks each letter that is present. For example, if the word had two R's and one of them was in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a dash for the other if it's present but in the wrong place. But in our case, we only have one R and one A in the guess, and they are both present but in wrong positions. So the secret word has at least one R and one A. It might have more, but we don't know.

To keep it simple, let's try to use a word with unique letters for now.

Another idea: use a word that has R and A and also includes other common letters like S, T, L, O.

Let me try to form such a word.

Possible words:
- ""ROAST"": But we have E excluded, and ROAST has O, A, S, T, and R. But wait, we have R in position 1 and A in position 3? But in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a dash meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, that would be the same position? We should avoid that. Also, we have R in position 1, which is a new position.

But note: the feedback for the first guess says A is not in position 3, so if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.

Therefore, in the second guess, we should put A in a position that is not 3 (so 1,2,4,5) and R in a position that is not 2 (so 1,3,4,5).

Let me try to list words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

Some options:
- ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is valid because A was not in position 2 in the first guess? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3, so position 2 is new for A. Similarly, R was in position 2 in the first guess, now we put it in position 3, which is new. Also, we test P, T, Y.

- ""TRAIL"": T, R, A, I, L -> R in position 2? But wait, in the first guess R was in position 2 and we got a dash meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting R in position 2. Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 and A is in position 3. That's exactly the positions we must avoid. So that's not good.

- ""BRAVO"": B, R, A, V, O -> R in position 2? Again, position 2 for R is bad.

We need to avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

So let's try to put R in position 1 and A in position 4: 
- ""RAPID"": R, A, P, I, D -> but A is in position 2? That's okay because A wasn't in position 2 before. But wait, we have A in position 2 and R in position 1. However, we are testing A in a new position (2) and R in a new position (1). But note: the word ""RAPID"" has A in position 2 and R in position 1. Also, we test P, I, D.

But we must avoid C, N, E. ""RAPID"" doesn't have those.

Another option: ""ROARS"" -> but this has two R's? And A is in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.

Another: ""SAVOR"": S, A, V, O, R -> A in position 2, R in position 5. This is good because A is not in position 3 and R is not in position 2. Also, we test S, V, O.

But we don't know if S, V, O are in the word. This is a good candidate.

Another: ""TAROT"": T, A, R, O, T -> has two T's. A in position 2, R in position 3. This is okay for A (position 2 is new) and R (position 3 is new). But we have duplicate T.

I think ""SAVOR"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places R and A in new positions.

But let me check if ""SAVOR"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to enjoy something.

Another common word: ""STARK"": S, T, A, R, K -> A in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.

""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is acceptable because A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (new). Also, we test P, T, S.

""PARTS"" is a valid word.

Now, comparing ""SAVOR"" and ""PARTS"":
- Both have A in position 2 and R in position 3? Wait, in ""SAVOR"": 
  S (1), A (2), V (3), O (4), R (5) -> so R is in position 5, not 3.

In ""SAVOR"", R is at the end. That's better because we haven't tested R in position 5 yet.

In ""PARTS"": 
  P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), S (5) -> R is in position 3 and A in position 2.

We haven't tested R in position 3 or 5, and A in position 2 is new.

But note: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we know it's not there. Now, if we put R in position 3, that's a new position. Similarly, A in position 2 is new.

However, we might get more information from ""SAVOR"" because it tests more positions for R and A.

But let me think about the letters: 
- ""SAVOR"" tests S, A, V, O, R. 
- ""PARTS"" tests P, A, R, T, S.

Both are good. But we also want to test common letters. S and T are very common, so ""PARTS"" tests S and T, which are common. ""SAVOR"" tests V and O, which are less common.

So ""PARTS"" might be better because it tests more common letters.

But we already know that the word has R and A, so we are guaranteed to get some feedback on them. The other letters are the ones we are testing for presence.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has R and A and also includes letters that are common and we haven't tested. We haven't tested S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

In ""PARTS"", we test P, A, R, T, S. We avoid C, N, E.

In ""SAVOR"", we test S, A, V, O, R.

I think ""PARTS"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more.

Another word: ""RATIO"" -> R, A, T, I, O. But R is in position 1, A in position 2. This is good: R not in 2, A not in 3. And we test T, I, O.

But we have to avoid E, which we do.

""RATIO"" is a common word.

But let me compare:
- ""RATIO"": R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)
- ""PARTS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)

Both are valid. But in ""RATIO"", we are testing I and O, which are vowels, and we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). But we don't know if it has more.

I think ""PARTS"" is better because it tests S and T, which are more common than I and O? Actually, T is very common.

But let me look at letter frequencies. In English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E is out, and C and N are out. So remaining: A, R, I, O, T, S, L.

We have already tested A and R (and know they are in the word). We haven't tested I, O, T, S, L.

So testing T and S (as in ""PARTS"") is good because they are high frequency.

Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R and A positions.

What about ""STAIR"": S, T, A, I, R -> A in position 3? Not allowed.

""ALERT"": but E is excluded.

""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> R in position 2? Not allowed.

""CRATE"": but C is excluded.

""PLANT"": but N is excluded.

So back to ""PARTS"" and ""RATIO"".

I think I'll go with ""PARTS"" because it tests S and T, which are very common, and it places R in a new position (3) and A in a new position (2).

So my second guess: PARTS

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PARTS"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the guess is ""parts"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: -, N: x, E: x), we know:
- The secret word contains R and A, but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked as present but wrong position).
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R must be in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5) and A must be in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).

For the second guess, I chose ""parts"" because:
- It includes R (now in position 3) and A (now in position 2), both in new positions to test their correct placement.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, N, E).
- It introduces new common letters (P, T, S) to gather more information about their presence/absence and positions.
- ""Parts"" is a valid 5-letter English word.

Another option: ""ROARS"" -> but this has two R's? And A is in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.

Another: ""SAVOR"": S, A, V, O, R -> A in position 2, R in position 5. This is good because A is not in position 3 and R is not in position 2. Also, we test S, V, O.

But we don't know if S, V, O are in the word. This is a good candidate.

Another: ""TAROT"": T, A, R, O, T -> has two T's. A in position 2, R in position 3. This is okay for A (position 2 is new) and R (position 3 is new). But we have duplicate T.

I think ""SAVOR"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places R and A in new positions.

But let me check if ""SAVOR"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to enjoy something.

Another common word: ""STARK"": S, T, A, R, K -> A in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.

""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is acceptable because A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (new). Also, we test P, T, S.

""PARTS"" is a valid word.

Now, comparing ""SAVOR"" and ""PARTS"":
- Both have A in position 2 and R in position 3? Wait, in ""SAVOR"": 
  S (1), A (2), V (3), O (4), R (5) -> so R is in position 5, not 3.

In ""SAVOR"", R is at the end. That's better because we haven't tested R in position 5 yet.

In ""PARTS"": 
  P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), S (5) -> R is in position 3 and A in position 2.

We haven't tested R in position 3 or 5, and A in position 2 is new.

But note: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we know it's not there. Now, if we put R in position 3, that's a new position. Similarly, A in position 2 is new.

However, we might get more information from ""SAVOR"" because it tests more positions for R and A.

But let me think about the letters: 
- ""SAVOR"" tests S, A, V, O, R. 
- ""PARTS"" tests P, A, R, T, S.

Both are good. But we also want to test common letters. S and T are very common, so ""PARTS"" tests S and T, which are common. ""SAVOR"" tests V and O, which are less common.

So ""PARTS"" might be better because it tests more common letters.

But we already know that the word has R and A, so we are guaranteed to get some feedback on them. The other letters are the ones we are testing for presence.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has R and A and also includes letters that are common and we haven't tested. We haven't tested S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

In ""PARTS"", we test P, A, R, T, S. We avoid C, N, E.

In ""SAVOR"", we test S, A, V, O, R.

I think ""PARTS"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more.

Another word: ""RATIO"" -> R, A, T, I, O. But R is in position 1, A in position 2. This is good: R not in 2, A not in 3. And we test T, I, O.

But we have to avoid E, which we do.

""RATIO"" is a common word.

But let me compare:
- ""RATIO"": R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)
- ""PARTS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)

Both are valid. But in ""RATIO"", we are testing I and O, which are vowels, and we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). But we don't know if it has more.

I think ""PARTS"" is better because it tests S and T, which are more common than I and O? Actually, T is very common.

But let me look at letter frequencies. In English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E is out, and C and N are out. So remaining: A, R, I, O, T, S, L.

We have already tested A and R (and know they are in the word). We haven't tested I, O, T, S, L.

So testing T and S (as in ""PARTS"") is good because they are high frequency.

Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R and A positions.

What about ""STAIR"": S, T, A, I, R -> A in position 3? Not allowed.

""ALERT"": but E is excluded.

""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> R in position 2? Not allowed.

""CRATE"": but C is excluded.

""PLANT"": but N is excluded.

So back to ""PARTS"" and ""RATIO"".

I think I'll go with ""PARTS"" because it tests S and T, which are very common, and it places R in a new position (3) and A in a new position (2).

So my second guess: PARTS

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PARTS"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the guess is ""parts"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: -, N: x, E: x), we know:
- The secret word contains R and A, but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked as present but wrong position).
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R must be in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5) and A must be in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).

For the second guess, I chose ""parts"" because:
- It includes R (now in position 3) and A (now in position 2), both in new positions to test their correct placement.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, N, E).
- It introduces new common letters (P, T, S) to gather more information about their presence/absence and positions.
- ""Parts"" is a valid 5-letter English word.",Guess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words.
 According to various sources, the most common letters in English words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible and also try to have a mix of vowels and consonants.

 I recall that ""ROAST"" is a good starting word because it has:
   R, O, A, S, T
 These are all common letters.

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also popular: C, R, A, N, E.

 Another one is ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

 I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N) and all are common.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

 But note: the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Let me write it in the required format.I need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to help identify letters in the secret word. 

After considering common starting words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" and ""ROAST,"" I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
- The letters C, R, A, N, and E are all high-frequency in English.
- This combination covers a broad range of possible matches, helping me narrow down the secret word efficiently with the first feedback.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". 
  Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the following properties:
- It is a 5-letter word.
- It contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
- The positions of R and A are not 2 and 3 respectively.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Does not contain C, N, or E (since they are not in the secret word).
- Includes R and A (to try to find their correct positions) and possibly other common letters.

We also want to try to place R and A in different positions than in the first guess (position 2 and 3).

Let's think about possible positions for R and A:
- R was in position 2 in ""crane"", so in the secret word, R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- A was in position 3 in ""crane"", so in the secret word, A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We should avoid using the letters C, N, E.

We can also try to include other common letters that haven't been tested yet. Common letters in English include: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

A good strategy is to try a word that has R and A in new positions and also tests other common letters.

Let me brainstorm some words that meet the criteria:
- Must include R and A (and not C, N, E).
- Let's try to put R in position 1 and A in position 4, for example.

Possible words:
- ""RADAR"": But this has two R's and two A's. Also, we know only one R and one A? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. The secret word might have duplicate letters? But in the example, the word ""BRISK"" has no duplicates. However, we cannot rule out duplicates. But to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates until we have evidence.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one R and one A as present (and in wrong positions). If there were duplicates, we might have seen more? Actually, the feedback only marks each letter that is present. For example, if the word had two R's and one of them was in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a dash for the other if it's present but in the wrong place. But in our case, we only have one R and one A in the guess, and they are both present but in wrong positions. So the secret word has at least one R and one A. It might have more, but we don't know.

To keep it simple, let's try to use a word with unique letters for now.

Another idea: use a word that has R and A and also includes other common letters like S, T, L, O.

Let me try to form such a word.

Possible words:
- ""ROAST"": But we have E excluded, and ROAST has O, A, S, T, and R. But wait, we have R in position 1 and A in position 3? But in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a dash meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, that would be the same position? We should avoid that. Also, we have R in position 1, which is a new position.

But note: the feedback for the first guess says A is not in position 3, so if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.

Therefore, in the second guess, we should put A in a position that is not 3 (so 1,2,4,5) and R in a position that is not 2 (so 1,3,4,5).

Let me try to list words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

Some options:
- ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is valid because A was not in position 2 in the first guess? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3, so position 2 is new for A. Similarly, R was in position 2 in the first guess, now we put it in position 3, which is new. Also, we test P, T, Y.

- ""TRAIL"": T, R, A, I, L -> R in position 2? But wait, in the first guess R was in position 2 and we got a dash meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting R in position 2. Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 and A is in position 3. That's exactly the positions we must avoid. So that's not good.

- ""BRAVO"": B, R, A, V, O -> R in position 2? Again, position 2 for R is bad.

We need to avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

So let's try to put R in position 1 and A in position 4: 
- ""RAPID"": R, A, P, I, D -> but A is in position 2? That's okay because A wasn't in position 2 before. But wait, we have A in position 2 and R in position 1. However, we are testing A in a new position (2) and R in a new position (1). But note: the word ""RAPID"" has A in position 2 and R in position 1. Also, we test P, I, D.

But we must avoid C, N, E. ""RAPID"" doesn't have those.

Another option: ""ROARS"" -> but this has two R's? And A is in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.

Another: ""SAVOR"": S, A, V, O, R -> A in position 2, R in position 5. This is good because A is not in position 3 and R is not in position 2. Also, we test S, V, O.

But we don't know if S, V, O are in the word. This is a good candidate.

Another: ""TAROT"": T, A, R, O, T -> has two T's. A in position 2, R in position 3. This is okay for A (position 2 is new) and R (position 3 is new). But we have duplicate T.

I think ""SAVOR"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places R and A in new positions.

But let me check if ""SAVOR"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to enjoy something.

Another common word: ""STARK"": S, T, A, R, K -> A in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.

""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is acceptable because A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (new). Also, we test P, T, S.

""PARTS"" is a valid word.

Now, comparing ""SAVOR"" and ""PARTS"":
- Both have A in position 2 and R in position 3? Wait, in ""SAVOR"": 
  S (1), A (2), V (3), O (4), R (5) -> so R is in position 5, not 3.

In ""SAVOR"", R is at the end. That's better because we haven't tested R in position 5 yet.

In ""PARTS"": 
  P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), S (5) -> R is in position 3 and A in position 2.

We haven't tested R in position 3 or 5, and A in position 2 is new.

But note: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we know it's not there. Now, if we put R in position 3, that's a new position. Similarly, A in position 2 is new.

However, we might get more information from ""SAVOR"" because it tests more positions for R and A.

But let me think about the letters: 
- ""SAVOR"" tests S, A, V, O, R. 
- ""PARTS"" tests P, A, R, T, S.

Both are good. But we also want to test common letters. S and T are very common, so ""PARTS"" tests S and T, which are common. ""SAVOR"" tests V and O, which are less common.

So ""PARTS"" might be better because it tests more common letters.

But we already know that the word has R and A, so we are guaranteed to get some feedback on them. The other letters are the ones we are testing for presence.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has R and A and also includes letters that are common and we haven't tested. We haven't tested S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

In ""PARTS"", we test P, A, R, T, S. We avoid C, N, E.

In ""SAVOR"", we test S, A, V, O, R.

I think ""PARTS"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more.

Another word: ""RATIO"" -> R, A, T, I, O. But R is in position 1, A in position 2. This is good: R not in 2, A not in 3. And we test T, I, O.

But we have to avoid E, which we do.

""RATIO"" is a common word.

But let me compare:
- ""RATIO"": R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)
- ""PARTS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)

Both are valid. But in ""RATIO"", we are testing I and O, which are vowels, and we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). But we don't know if it has more.

I think ""PARTS"" is better because it tests S and T, which are more common than I and O? Actually, T is very common.

We have already tested A and R (and know they are in the word). We haven't tested I, O, T, S, L.

So testing T and S (as in ""PARTS"") is good because they are high frequency.

Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R and A positions.

What about ""STAIR"": S, T, A, I, R -> A in position 3? Not allowed.

""ALERT"": but E is excluded.

""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> R in position 2? Not allowed.

""CRATE"": but C is excluded.

""PLANT"": but N is excluded.

So back to ""PARTS"" and ""RATIO"".

I think I'll go with ""PARTS"" because it tests S and T, which are very common, and it places R in a new position (3) and A in a new position (2).

So my second guess: PARTS

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PARTS"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the guess is ""parts"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: -, N: x, E: x), we know:
- The secret word contains R and A, but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked as present but wrong position).
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R must be in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5) and A must be in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).

For the second guess, I chose ""parts"" because:

- It avoids the excluded letters (C, N, E).

- ""Parts"" is a valid 5-letter English word.

Again, position 2 for R is bad.\n\nWe need to avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.\n\nSo let\'s try to put R in position 1 and A in position 4: \n- ""RAPID"": R, A, P, I, D -> but A is in position 2? That\'s okay because A wasn\'t in position 2 before. But wait, we have A in position 2 and R in position 1. However, we are testing A in a new position (2) and R in a new position (1). But note: the word ""RAPID"" has A in position 2 and R in position 1. Also, we test P, I, D.\n\nBut we must avoid C, N, E. ""RAPID"" doesn\'t have those.\n\nAnother option: ""ROARS"" -> but this has two R\'s? And A is in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.\n\nAnother: ""SAVOR"": S, A, V, O, R -> A in position 2, R in position 5. This is good because A is not in position 3 and R is not in position 2. Also, we test S, V, O.\n\nBut we don\'t know if S, V, O are in the word. This is a good candidate.\n\nAnother: ""TAROT"": T, A, R, O, T -> has two T\'s. A in position 2, R in position 3. This is okay for A (position 2 is new) and R (position 3 is new). But we have duplicate T.\n\nI think ""SAVOR"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places R and A in new positions.\n\nBut let me check if ""SAVOR"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to enjoy something.\n\nAnother common word: ""STARK"": S, T, A, R, K -> A in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.\n\n""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is acceptable because A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (new). Also, we test P, T, S.\n\n""PARTS"" is a valid word.\n\nNow, comparing ""SAVOR"" and ""PARTS"":\n- Both have A in position 2 and R in position 3? Wait, in ""SAVOR"": \n  S (1), A (2), V (3), O (4), R (5) -> so R is in position 5, not 3.\n\nIn ""SAVOR"", R is at the end. That\'s better because we haven\'t tested R in position 5 yet.\n\nIn ""PARTS"": \n  P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), S (5) -> R is in position 3 and A in position 2.\n\nWe haven\'t tested R in position 3 or 5, and A in position 2 is new.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we know it\'s not there. Now, if we put R in position 3, that\'s a new position. Similarly, A in position 2 is new.\n\nHowever, we might get more information from ""SAVOR"" because it tests more positions for R and A.\n\nBut let me think about the letters: \n- ""SAVOR"" tests S, A, V, O, R. \n- ""PARTS"" tests P, A, R, T, S.\n\nBoth are good. But we also want to test common letters. S and T are very common, so ""PARTS"" tests S and T, which are common. ""SAVOR"" tests V and O, which are less common.\n\nSo ""PARTS"" might be better because it tests more common letters.\n\nBut we already know that the word has R and A, so we are guaranteed to get some feedback on them. The other letters are the ones we are testing for presence.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to use a word that has R and A and also includes letters that are common and we haven\'t tested. We haven\'t tested S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\nIn ""PARTS"", we test P, A, R, T, S. We avoid C, N, E.\n\nIn ""SAVOR"", we test S, A, V, O, R.\n\nI think ""PARTS"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more.\n\nAnother word: ""RATIO"" -> R, A, T, I, O. But R is in position 1, A in position 2. This is good: R not in 2, A not in 3. And we test T, I, O.\n\nBut we have to avoid E, which we do.\n\n""RATIO"" is a common word.\n\nBut let me compare:\n- ""RATIO"": R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)\n- ""PARTS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)\n\nBoth are valid. But in ""RATIO"", we are testing I and O, which are vowels, and we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). But we don\'t know if it has more.\n\nI think ""PARTS"" is better because it tests S and T, which are more common than I and O? Actually, T is very common.\n\nBut let me look at letter frequencies. In English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E is out, and C and N are out. So remaining: A, R, I, O, T, S, L.\n\nWe have already tested A and R (and know they are in the word). We haven\'t tested I, O, T, S, L.\n\nSo testing T and S (as in ""PARTS"") is good because they are high frequency.\n\nAlternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R and A positions.\n\nWhat about ""STAIR"": S, T, A, I, R -> A in position 3? Not allowed.\n\n""ALERT"": but E is excluded.\n\n""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> R in position 2? Not allowed.\n\n""CRATE"": but C is excluded.\n\n""PLANT"": but N is excluded.\n\nSo back to ""PARTS"" and ""RATIO"".\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""PARTS"" because it tests S and T, which are very common, and it places R in a new position (3) and A in a new position (2).\n\nSo my second guess: PARTS\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PARTS"" is a valid English word.\n\nTherefore, the guess is ""parts"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: -, N: x, E: x), we know:\n- The secret word contains R and A, but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked as present but wrong position).\n- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n- R must be in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5) and A must be in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""parts"" because:\n- It includes R (now in position 3) and A (now in position 2), both in new positions to test their correct placement.\n- It avoids the excluded letters (C, N, E).\n- It introduces new common letters (P, T, S) to gather more information about their presence/absence and positions.\n- ""Parts"" is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>parts</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. Crane: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x) → so R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
2. Parts: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x) → now A is correct in position 2, and R is correct in position 3? Wait, let's see the positions.

Recall the positions in ""parts"":
  P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)

Feedback: 
  P(x) → P not in word.
  A(✓) → A is correct at position 2. So the secret word has A in the second position.
  R(✓) → R is correct at position 3. So the secret word has R in the third position.
  T(x) → T not in word.
  S(x) → S not in word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has A as the second letter and R as the third letter. So the word is: _ A R _ _
- We also know from the first guess that the word contains at least one more letter that we don't know yet? Actually, we only know for sure the letters we have: A and R are fixed, and from the first guess, we knew R and A are present. Now with the second guess, we have them fixed.

Additionally, we know the absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S are not in the word.

Now, we have two positions to fill: first and fourth, and fifth.

We need to think about the remaining letters that can be used. The word must be a 5-letter word without C, N, E, P, T, S.

We also remember from the first guess that the word has R and A (now fixed at positions 2 and 3) and possibly other letters.

We have three unknown positions: 1, 4, 5.

We must choose a guess that is a valid 5-letter word, has A in position 2 and R in position 3? But we don't have to fix them? Actually, we know they are correct, so any future guess must include A at position 2 and R at position 3 because we know they are correct. Therefore, our guess should have the form: ? A R ? ?

But note: we are allowed to use letters that we have not ruled out. The absent letters are: C, N, E, P, T, S. So the available letters are the rest of the alphabet.

Common letters that are available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many common letters as possible in the unknown positions.

We have three positions to test: position 1, 4, and 5.

We can try a word like: _ A R _ _

We need to pick letters for positions 1, 4, 5 from the available set.

Given that we only have 4 tries left, we should aim for a word that tests common letters.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern _ A R _ _

Some examples:
- BARNY: but N and Y? N is out (from guess1), so invalid because N is excluded.
- HAREM: H, A, R, E, M → E is excluded? Guess1 said E is not in the word. So E is out. Invalid.
- CAROL: C is excluded. Invalid.
- DARKY: D, A, R, K, Y → no excluded letters? Let's check: D, A, R, K, Y. Available letters? Yes. But is ""DARKY"" a word? Not standard. Maybe not valid.
- FARMY: F, A, R, M, Y → again, not sure if ""FARMY"" is a word.
- Valid words: 
  - ""HARDY"": H, A, R, D, Y → H, D, Y are available. But we have positions: position 1: H, position 4: D, position 5: Y. So the word is H A R D Y.
  - ""LARDY"": L, A, R, D, Y → LARDY is an adjective meaning like lard.
  - ""MARLY"": M, A, R, L, Y → MARLY? Not common.

Better choices:
- ""HARDY"" (meaning strong or durable) is valid.
- ""MARRY"": M, A, R, R, Y → but this has two R's. We don't know if the word can have duplicate R? We know R is at position 3. But R could appear again? Let me see the feedback rules: each letter is marked individually. If there is another R, it would be considered. But we have no information yet about duplicate letters.

In our feedback for ""crane"", we only had one R and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""parts"", we had one R and it was correct. So if the secret word has only one R, that's fine. But if it has two, then we haven't tested for that.

But testing a duplicate in a guess is risky because if it's not present, we rule out that letter unnecessarily for other positions? Actually, if we test a letter again and it is not in the word, we get an 'x'. If it is present and in the correct position, we get a check. If present but wrong position, a dash.

But in our case, for R: we already have one R correctly placed at position 3. So if we put another R in, say, position 1, then:
- If the secret word has only one R, the extra R would be marked as 'x' (absent for that position) meaning the actual R is already accounted for at position 3.
- If the secret word has two R's, then it could be marked as dash if in the word but wrong position (if position 1 is not correct for a second R) or check if it is correct.

But to avoid complexity, perhaps we should avoid duplicates for now and choose a word with unique letters.

So ""HARDY"": H A R D Y → letters are H, A, R, D, Y. A and R are known, so we are testing H, D, and Y.

Similarly, ""BARDY"": B, A, R, D, Y → BARDY might not be as common.

Other possibilities:
- ""JARDY"": not a word.
- ""WARDS"": but S is excluded. Invalid.
- ""CARDS"": C excluded. Invalid.
- ""HARLOT"": H A R L O T → too many letters? Should be 5-letter.

So limited options.

But we can consider words with O, L, etc.

Another one: ""HAREM"" has E which is excluded.

""FARMY"" is not standard.

""BARMY"": B, A, R, M, Y → BARMY (meaning crazy in British English). Valid? Yes.

Similarly, ""HARDY"" and ""BARMY"" are both options.

Also: ""LARVA"": L, A, R, V, A → has A again? Position 4: V, Position 5: A. But A is already known. Now, we are putting A again. So the letters: L, A, R, V, A.

This duplicates A. We don't know if the word has multiple A's? In position 5: if we put A, and if the secret word has a second A, it might be present.

But again, we want to test new letters.

Perhaps it's better to avoid duplicates if we can.

So let me list some words that fit _ A R _ _ without duplicate A and without the excluded letters:

- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y)
- BARMY (B, A, R, M, Y)
- LARKY (L, A, R, K, Y) → meaning? Prone to larks? Might not be common.
- FARDY (F, A, R, D, Y) → obsolete word?
- GARTH (G, A, R, T, H) → T is excluded? In ""parts"", T was marked absent, so T is not in the word. Therefore, GARTH has T — invalid.

We have to avoid T because it was ruled out by the second guess.

Similarly, S is excluded.

Another word: ""WARLY"" (W, A, R, L, Y) → WARLY means wary? Not standard; wary is 4 letters.

""JARUL"" — not a word.

Perhaps ""AARGH"" — but starts with AA, not the form. And G and H. Positions: A in position 2? But the first letter would be A? No, we need _ A R ... so the first letter is not fixed to A.

Another idea: ""OARED"" — O, A, R, E, D → E is excluded. Invalid.

Without E:

- ""HARDY"" (as above)
- ""BARMY""
- ""MADLY"" — M, A, D, L, Y → but no R? We must have R at position 3? In ""MADLY"", it's M(1), A(2), D(3), L(4), Y(5) — so position 3 is D, not R. But we need position 3 to be R? So the word must have R at position 3. Therefore, the pattern is _ A R _ _.

So ""MADLY"" doesn't fit because the third letter is D, not R.

We must have the second letter A and third letter R.

So words: [letter1] A R [letter4] [letter5]

Available letters: except C,N,E,P,T,S.

Common letters left: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Now, let me find valid words:

- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y) → valid word meaning resilient.
- BARMY (B, A, R, M, Y) → valid, informal British English.
- FARDY: not common, maybe not in dictionary.
- LARDY (L, A, R, D, Y) → valid, meaning resembling lard or overweight.
- WARBY? Not a word.
- JARED: J, A, R, E, D → E excluded? Invalid.
- HARKS: H, A, R, K, S → S excluded? Invalid.
- DARK: too short.
- PARK: too short.

Better: 
- ""DARKY"" — D, A, R, K, Y → offensive term, shouldn't use. Or not valid in word games?
- ""MARRY"" — M, A, R, R, Y → has duplicate R. But we can consider: if we guess ""MARRY"", it would be M(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). Since we know position 3 is R and correct, the fourth R would be an extra. If the word has a second R at position 4, we'll get a dash or check? But we don't know if it has two R's.

However, we want to test new letters, so duplicate R might not be efficient.

Another word: ""VARIA"" — V, A, R, I, A → form? But pattern: it is V A R I A → so positions: V(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), A(5). Here, we have duplicate A. And we test V and I.

""VARIA"" is a valid word (plural of varium? or in biology). But rare.

Better to go with ""HARDY"" or ""BARMY"" or ""LARDY"".

I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters: H, D, Y.

We test H at position 1, D at position 4, Y at position 5.

If they are absent, we know. If present, we get feedback.

So I'll go with ""HARDY"".

But note: we might solve faster if we get lucky.

We have _ A R _ _

Possible solutions: Based on what we know, words like ""hardy"", ""barmy"", ""lardy"", ""fairy"" but ""fairy"" has F, A, I, R, Y? Wait, ""fairy"" is F A I R Y, so third letter is I, not R. Doesn't fit.

Another: ""marry"" as above, but with duplicate R.

Or ""carry"" but C excluded.

Or ""harry"" — H, A, R, R, Y → duplicate R.

""parry"" — P excluded.

""quarry"" — too long.

So five-letter: ""hardy"", ""barmy"", ""lardy"", ""tardy"" but T excluded? ""tardy"" has T? T(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) — T is excluded by guess2? Guess2: ""parts"" had T at position4 and marked as absent. So T is not in the word. Therefore, ""tardy"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""party"" has T.

So ""hardy"" is a good representative.

Therefore, let's guess ""HARDY"".
</think>
Based on the cumulative feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"") feedback**: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  This indicates that:  
  - C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.  
  - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked ""-"" in positions 2 and 3, respectively).

- **Guess 2 (""parts"") feedback**: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x)  
  This indicates that:  
  - P, T, and S are **not** in the secret word.  
  - A is **correctly placed at position 2**.  
  - R is **correctly placed at position 3**.  

### Deduced information about the secret word:
The secret word must:  
- Be 5 letters long.  
- Have the pattern `_ A R _ _` (since A is fixed at position 2 and R at position 3).  
- Exclude the letters **C, E, N, P, T, S** (all marked absent in previous guesses).  
- Include only letters from the remaining pool: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  

### Strategy for the next guess:
- The goal is to test new common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 to narrow down possibilities.  
- We should avoid duplicating letters unnecessarily (though duplicates are possible if evidence suggests them), as there may be additional unknown letters.  
- Common letters not yet tested include **L, M, D, Y, H, O, U, B**—prioritizing these can maximize information gain.  
- Valid words fitting the `_ A R _ _` pattern without excluded letters include ""HARDY"" (tests H, D, Y), ""BARMY"" (tests B, M, Y), or ""LARDY"" (tests L, D, Y). ""HARDY"" is chosen because it uses high-frequency letters (H, D, Y) and is a common word.  

This guess will confirm or rule out H, D, and Y in their respective positions, bringing us closer to the solution.

<guess>hardy</guess>",hardy,"We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. Crane: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x) → so R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
2. Parts: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x) → now A is correct in position 2, and R is correct in position 3? Wait, let's see the positions.

Recall the positions in ""parts"":
  P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)

Feedback: 
  P(x) → P not in word.
  A(✓) → A is correct at position 2. So the secret word has A in the second position.
  R(✓) → R is correct at position 3. So the secret word has R in the third position.
  T(x) → T not in word.
  S(x) → S not in word.

- ""CARDS"": C excluded. Invalid.
- ""HARLOT"": H A R L O T → too many letters? Should be 5-letter.

So limited options.

But we can consider words with O, L, etc.

Another one: ""HAREM"" has E which is excluded.

""FARMY"" is not standard.

""BARMY"": B, A, R, M, Y → BARMY (meaning crazy in British English). Valid? Yes.

Similarly, ""HARDY"" and ""BARMY"" are both options.

Also: ""LARVA"": L, A, R, V, A → has A again? Position 4: V, Position 5: A. But A is already known. Now, we are putting A again. So the letters: L, A, R, V, A.

- ""MADLY"" — M, A, D, L, Y → but no R? We must have R at position 3? In ""MADLY"", it's M(1), A(2), D(3), L(4), Y(5) — so position 3 is D, not R. But we need position 3 to be R? So the word must have R at position 3. Therefore, the pattern is _ A R _ _.

So ""MADLY"" doesn't fit because the third letter is D, not R.

We must have the second letter A and third letter R.

So words: [letter1] A R [letter4] [letter5]

Available letters: except C,N,E,P,T,S.

Common letters left: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Now, let me find valid words:

- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y) → valid word meaning resilient.
- BARMY (B, A, R, M, Y) → valid, informal British English.
- FARDY: not common, maybe not in dictionary.
- LARDY (L, A, R, D, Y) → valid, meaning resembling lard or overweight.
- WARBY? Not a word.
- JARED: J, A, R, E, D → E excluded? Invalid.
- HARKS: H, A, R, K, S → S excluded? Invalid.
- DARK: too short.
- PARK: too short.

Better: 
- ""DARKY"" — D, A, R, K, Y → offensive term, shouldn't use. Or not valid in word games?
- ""MARRY"" — M, A, R, R, Y → has duplicate R. But we can consider: if we guess ""MARRY"", it would be M(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). Since we know position 3 is R and correct, the fourth R would be an extra. If the word has a second R at position 4, we'll get a dash or check? But we don't know if it has two R's.

However, we want to test new letters, so duplicate R might not be efficient.

Another word: ""VARIA"" — V, A, R, I, A → form? But pattern: it is V A R I A → so positions: V(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), A(5). Here, we have duplicate A. And we test V and I.

""VARIA"" is a valid word (plural of varium? or in biology). But rare.

Better to go with ""HARDY"" or ""BARMY"" or ""LARDY"".

I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters: H, D, Y.

We test H at position 1, D at position 4, Y at position 5.

If they are absent, we know. If present, we get feedback.

So I'll go with ""HARDY"".

But note: we might solve faster if we get lucky.

We have _ A R _ _

Possible solutions: Based on what we know, words like ""hardy"", ""barmy"", ""lardy"", ""fairy"" but ""fairy"" has F, A, I, R, Y? Wait, ""fairy"" is F A I R Y, so third letter is I, not R. Doesn't fit.

Another: ""marry"" as above, but with duplicate R.

Or ""carry"" but C excluded.

Or ""harry"" — H, A, R, R, Y → duplicate R.

""parry"" — P excluded.

""quarry"" — too long.

So five-letter: ""hardy"", ""barmy"", ""lardy"", ""tardy"" but T excluded? ""tardy"" has T? T(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) — T is excluded by guess2? Guess2: ""parts"" had T at position4 and marked as absent. So T is not in the word. Therefore, ""tardy"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""party"" has T.

So ""hardy"" is a good representative.

Therefore, let's guess ""HARDY"".Based on the cumulative feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"") feedback**: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  This indicates that:  
  - C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.  
  - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked ""-"" in positions 2 and 3, respectively).

- **Guess 2 (""parts"") feedback**: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x)  
  This indicates that:  
  - P, T, and S are **not** in the secret word.  
  - A is **correctly placed at position 2**.  
  - R is **correctly placed at position 3**.  

### Deduced information about the secret word:
The secret word must:  
- Be 5 letters long.  
- Have the pattern `_ A R _ _` (since A is fixed at position 2 and R at position 3).  
- Exclude the letters **C, E, N, P, T, S** (all marked absent in previous guesses).  
- Include only letters from the remaining pool: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  

### Strategy for the next guess:
- The goal is to test new common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 to narrow down possibilities.  
- We should avoid duplicating letters unnecessarily (though duplicates are possible if evidence suggests them), as there may be additional unknown letters.  
- Common letters not yet tested include **L, M, D, Y, H, O, U, B**—prioritizing these can maximize information gain.  
- Valid words fitting the `_ A R _ _` pattern without excluded letters include ""HARDY"" (tests H, D, Y), ""BARMY"" (tests B, M, Y), or ""LARDY"" (tests L, D, Y). ""HARDY"" is chosen because it uses high-frequency letters (H, D, Y) and is a common word.  

This guess will confirm or rule out H, D, and Y in their respective positions, bringing us closer to the solution.",Guess 3: hardy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words.
 According to various sources, the most common letters in English words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible and also try to have a mix of vowels and consonants.

 I recall that ""ROAST"" is a good starting word because it has:
   R, O, A, S, T
 These are all common letters.

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also popular: C, R, A, N, E.

 Another one is ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

 I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N) and all are common.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

 But note: the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Let me write it in the required format.I need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to help identify letters in the secret word. 

After considering common starting words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" and ""ROAST,"" I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
- The letters C, R, A, N, and E are all high-frequency in English.
- This combination covers a broad range of possible matches, helping me narrow down the secret word efficiently with the first feedback.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". 
  Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the following properties:
- It is a 5-letter word.
- It contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
- The positions of R and A are not 2 and 3 respectively.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Does not contain C, N, or E (since they are not in the secret word).
- Includes R and A (to try to find their correct positions) and possibly other common letters.

We also want to try to place R and A in different positions than in the first guess (position 2 and 3).

Let's think about possible positions for R and A:
- R was in position 2 in ""crane"", so in the secret word, R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- A was in position 3 in ""crane"", so in the secret word, A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We should avoid using the letters C, N, E.

We can also try to include other common letters that haven't been tested yet. Common letters in English include: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

A good strategy is to try a word that has R and A in new positions and also tests other common letters.

Let me brainstorm some words that meet the criteria:
- Must include R and A (and not C, N, E).
- Let's try to put R in position 1 and A in position 4, for example.

Possible words:
- ""RADAR"": But this has two R's and two A's. Also, we know only one R and one A? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. The secret word might have duplicate letters? But in the example, the word ""BRISK"" has no duplicates. However, we cannot rule out duplicates. But to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates until we have evidence.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one R and one A as present (and in wrong positions). If there were duplicates, we might have seen more? Actually, the feedback only marks each letter that is present. For example, if the word had two R's and one of them was in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a dash for the other if it's present but in the wrong place. But in our case, we only have one R and one A in the guess, and they are both present but in wrong positions. So the secret word has at least one R and one A. It might have more, but we don't know.

To keep it simple, let's try to use a word with unique letters for now.

Another idea: use a word that has R and A and also includes other common letters like S, T, L, O.

Let me try to form such a word.

Possible words:
- ""ROAST"": But we have E excluded, and ROAST has O, A, S, T, and R. But wait, we have R in position 1 and A in position 3? But in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a dash meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, that would be the same position? We should avoid that. Also, we have R in position 1, which is a new position.

But note: the feedback for the first guess says A is not in position 3, so if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.

Therefore, in the second guess, we should put A in a position that is not 3 (so 1,2,4,5) and R in a position that is not 2 (so 1,3,4,5).

Let me try to list words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

Some options:
- ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is valid because A was not in position 2 in the first guess? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3, so position 2 is new for A. Similarly, R was in position 2 in the first guess, now we put it in position 3, which is new. Also, we test P, T, Y.

- ""TRAIL"": T, R, A, I, L -> R in position 2? But wait, in the first guess R was in position 2 and we got a dash meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting R in position 2. Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 and A is in position 3. That's exactly the positions we must avoid. So that's not good.

- ""BRAVO"": B, R, A, V, O -> R in position 2? Again, position 2 for R is bad.

We need to avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

So let's try to put R in position 1 and A in position 4: 
- ""RAPID"": R, A, P, I, D -> but A is in position 2? That's okay because A wasn't in position 2 before. But wait, we have A in position 2 and R in position 1. However, we are testing A in a new position (2) and R in a new position (1). But note: the word ""RAPID"" has A in position 2 and R in position 1. Also, we test P, I, D.

But we must avoid C, N, E. ""RAPID"" doesn't have those.

Another option: ""ROARS"" -> but this has two R's? And A is in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.

Another: ""SAVOR"": S, A, V, O, R -> A in position 2, R in position 5. This is good because A is not in position 3 and R is not in position 2. Also, we test S, V, O.

But we don't know if S, V, O are in the word. This is a good candidate.

Another: ""TAROT"": T, A, R, O, T -> has two T's. A in position 2, R in position 3. This is okay for A (position 2 is new) and R (position 3 is new). But we have duplicate T.

I think ""SAVOR"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places R and A in new positions.

But let me check if ""SAVOR"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to enjoy something.

Another common word: ""STARK"": S, T, A, R, K -> A in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.

""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is acceptable because A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (new). Also, we test P, T, S.

""PARTS"" is a valid word.

Now, comparing ""SAVOR"" and ""PARTS"":
- Both have A in position 2 and R in position 3? Wait, in ""SAVOR"": 
  S (1), A (2), V (3), O (4), R (5) -> so R is in position 5, not 3.

In ""SAVOR"", R is at the end. That's better because we haven't tested R in position 5 yet.

In ""PARTS"": 
  P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), S (5) -> R is in position 3 and A in position 2.

We haven't tested R in position 3 or 5, and A in position 2 is new.

But note: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we know it's not there. Now, if we put R in position 3, that's a new position. Similarly, A in position 2 is new.

However, we might get more information from ""SAVOR"" because it tests more positions for R and A.

But let me think about the letters: 
- ""SAVOR"" tests S, A, V, O, R. 
- ""PARTS"" tests P, A, R, T, S.

Both are good. But we also want to test common letters. S and T are very common, so ""PARTS"" tests S and T, which are common. ""SAVOR"" tests V and O, which are less common.

So ""PARTS"" might be better because it tests more common letters.

But we already know that the word has R and A, so we are guaranteed to get some feedback on them. The other letters are the ones we are testing for presence.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has R and A and also includes letters that are common and we haven't tested. We haven't tested S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

In ""PARTS"", we test P, A, R, T, S. We avoid C, N, E.

In ""SAVOR"", we test S, A, V, O, R.

I think ""PARTS"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more.

Another word: ""RATIO"" -> R, A, T, I, O. But R is in position 1, A in position 2. This is good: R not in 2, A not in 3. And we test T, I, O.

But we have to avoid E, which we do.

""RATIO"" is a common word.

But let me compare:
- ""RATIO"": R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)
- ""PARTS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)

Both are valid. But in ""RATIO"", we are testing I and O, which are vowels, and we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). But we don't know if it has more.

I think ""PARTS"" is better because it tests S and T, which are more common than I and O? Actually, T is very common.

But let me look at letter frequencies. In English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E is out, and C and N are out. So remaining: A, R, I, O, T, S, L.

We have already tested A and R (and know they are in the word). We haven't tested I, O, T, S, L.

So testing T and S (as in ""PARTS"") is good because they are high frequency.

Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R and A positions.

What about ""STAIR"": S, T, A, I, R -> A in position 3? Not allowed.

""ALERT"": but E is excluded.

""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> R in position 2? Not allowed.

""CRATE"": but C is excluded.

""PLANT"": but N is excluded.

So back to ""PARTS"" and ""RATIO"".

I think I'll go with ""PARTS"" because it tests S and T, which are very common, and it places R in a new position (3) and A in a new position (2).

So my second guess: PARTS

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PARTS"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the guess is ""parts"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: -, N: x, E: x), we know:
- The secret word contains R and A, but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked as present but wrong position).
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R must be in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5) and A must be in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).

For the second guess, I chose ""parts"" because:
- It includes R (now in position 3) and A (now in position 2), both in new positions to test their correct placement.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, N, E).
- It introduces new common letters (P, T, S) to gather more information about their presence/absence and positions.
- ""Parts"" is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>parts</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. Crane: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x) → so R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
2. Parts: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x) → now A is correct in position 2, and R is correct in position 3? Wait, let's see the positions.

Recall the positions in ""parts"":
  P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)

Feedback: 
  P(x) → P not in word.
  A(✓) → A is correct at position 2. So the secret word has A in the second position.
  R(✓) → R is correct at position 3. So the secret word has R in the third position.
  T(x) → T not in word.
  S(x) → S not in word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has A as the second letter and R as the third letter. So the word is: _ A R _ _
- We also know from the first guess that the word contains at least one more letter that we don't know yet? Actually, we only know for sure the letters we have: A and R are fixed, and from the first guess, we knew R and A are present. Now with the second guess, we have them fixed.

Additionally, we know the absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S are not in the word.

Now, we have two positions to fill: first and fourth, and fifth.

We need to think about the remaining letters that can be used. The word must be a 5-letter word without C, N, E, P, T, S.

We also remember from the first guess that the word has R and A (now fixed at positions 2 and 3) and possibly other letters.

We have three unknown positions: 1, 4, 5.

We must choose a guess that is a valid 5-letter word, has A in position 2 and R in position 3? But we don't have to fix them? Actually, we know they are correct, so any future guess must include A at position 2 and R at position 3 because we know they are correct. Therefore, our guess should have the form: ? A R ? ?

But note: we are allowed to use letters that we have not ruled out. The absent letters are: C, N, E, P, T, S. So the available letters are the rest of the alphabet.

Common letters that are available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many common letters as possible in the unknown positions.

We have three positions to test: position 1, 4, and 5.

We can try a word like: _ A R _ _

We need to pick letters for positions 1, 4, 5 from the available set.

Given that we only have 4 tries left, we should aim for a word that tests common letters.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern _ A R _ _

Some examples:
- BARNY: but N and Y? N is out (from guess1), so invalid because N is excluded.
- HAREM: H, A, R, E, M → E is excluded? Guess1 said E is not in the word. So E is out. Invalid.
- CAROL: C is excluded. Invalid.
- DARKY: D, A, R, K, Y → no excluded letters? Let's check: D, A, R, K, Y. Available letters? Yes. But is ""DARKY"" a word? Not standard. Maybe not valid.
- FARMY: F, A, R, M, Y → again, not sure if ""FARMY"" is a word.
- Valid words: 
  - ""HARDY"": H, A, R, D, Y → H, D, Y are available. But we have positions: position 1: H, position 4: D, position 5: Y. So the word is H A R D Y.
  - ""LARDY"": L, A, R, D, Y → LARDY is an adjective meaning like lard.
  - ""MARLY"": M, A, R, L, Y → MARLY? Not common.

Better choices:
- ""HARDY"" (meaning strong or durable) is valid.
- ""MARRY"": M, A, R, R, Y → but this has two R's. We don't know if the word can have duplicate R? We know R is at position 3. But R could appear again? Let me see the feedback rules: each letter is marked individually. If there is another R, it would be considered. But we have no information yet about duplicate letters.

In our feedback for ""crane"", we only had one R and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""parts"", we had one R and it was correct. So if the secret word has only one R, that's fine. But if it has two, then we haven't tested for that.

But testing a duplicate in a guess is risky because if it's not present, we rule out that letter unnecessarily for other positions? Actually, if we test a letter again and it is not in the word, we get an 'x'. If it is present and in the correct position, we get a check. If present but wrong position, a dash.

But in our case, for R: we already have one R correctly placed at position 3. So if we put another R in, say, position 1, then:
- If the secret word has only one R, the extra R would be marked as 'x' (absent for that position) meaning the actual R is already accounted for at position 3.
- If the secret word has two R's, then it could be marked as dash if in the word but wrong position (if position 1 is not correct for a second R) or check if it is correct.

But to avoid complexity, perhaps we should avoid duplicates for now and choose a word with unique letters.

So ""HARDY"": H A R D Y → letters are H, A, R, D, Y. A and R are known, so we are testing H, D, and Y.

Similarly, ""BARDY"": B, A, R, D, Y → BARDY might not be as common.

Other possibilities:
- ""JARDY"": not a word.
- ""WARDS"": but S is excluded. Invalid.
- ""CARDS"": C excluded. Invalid.
- ""HARLOT"": H A R L O T → too many letters? Should be 5-letter.

So limited options.

But we can consider words with O, L, etc.

Another one: ""HAREM"" has E which is excluded.

""FARMY"" is not standard.

""BARMY"": B, A, R, M, Y → BARMY (meaning crazy in British English). Valid? Yes.

Similarly, ""HARDY"" and ""BARMY"" are both options.

Also: ""LARVA"": L, A, R, V, A → has A again? Position 4: V, Position 5: A. But A is already known. Now, we are putting A again. So the letters: L, A, R, V, A.

This duplicates A. We don't know if the word has multiple A's? In position 5: if we put A, and if the secret word has a second A, it might be present.

But again, we want to test new letters.

Perhaps it's better to avoid duplicates if we can.

So let me list some words that fit _ A R _ _ without duplicate A and without the excluded letters:

- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y)
- BARMY (B, A, R, M, Y)
- LARKY (L, A, R, K, Y) → meaning? Prone to larks? Might not be common.
- FARDY (F, A, R, D, Y) → obsolete word?
- GARTH (G, A, R, T, H) → T is excluded? In ""parts"", T was marked absent, so T is not in the word. Therefore, GARTH has T — invalid.

We have to avoid T because it was ruled out by the second guess.

Similarly, S is excluded.

Another word: ""WARLY"" (W, A, R, L, Y) → WARLY means wary? Not standard; wary is 4 letters.

""JARUL"" — not a word.

Perhaps ""AARGH"" — but starts with AA, not the form. And G and H. Positions: A in position 2? But the first letter would be A? No, we need _ A R ... so the first letter is not fixed to A.

Another idea: ""OARED"" — O, A, R, E, D → E is excluded. Invalid.

Without E:

- ""HARDY"" (as above)
- ""BARMY""
- ""MADLY"" — M, A, D, L, Y → but no R? We must have R at position 3? In ""MADLY"", it's M(1), A(2), D(3), L(4), Y(5) — so position 3 is D, not R. But we need position 3 to be R? So the word must have R at position 3. Therefore, the pattern is _ A R _ _.

So ""MADLY"" doesn't fit because the third letter is D, not R.

We must have the second letter A and third letter R.

So words: [letter1] A R [letter4] [letter5]

Available letters: except C,N,E,P,T,S.

Common letters left: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Now, let me find valid words:

- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y) → valid word meaning resilient.
- BARMY (B, A, R, M, Y) → valid, informal British English.
- FARDY: not common, maybe not in dictionary.
- LARDY (L, A, R, D, Y) → valid, meaning resembling lard or overweight.
- WARBY? Not a word.
- JARED: J, A, R, E, D → E excluded? Invalid.
- HARKS: H, A, R, K, S → S excluded? Invalid.
- DARK: too short.
- PARK: too short.

Better: 
- ""DARKY"" — D, A, R, K, Y → offensive term, shouldn't use. Or not valid in word games?
- ""MARRY"" — M, A, R, R, Y → has duplicate R. But we can consider: if we guess ""MARRY"", it would be M(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). Since we know position 3 is R and correct, the fourth R would be an extra. If the word has a second R at position 4, we'll get a dash or check? But we don't know if it has two R's.

However, we want to test new letters, so duplicate R might not be efficient.

Another word: ""VARIA"" — V, A, R, I, A → form? But pattern: it is V A R I A → so positions: V(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), A(5). Here, we have duplicate A. And we test V and I.

""VARIA"" is a valid word (plural of varium? or in biology). But rare.

Better to go with ""HARDY"" or ""BARMY"" or ""LARDY"".

I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters: H, D, Y.

We test H at position 1, D at position 4, Y at position 5.

If they are absent, we know. If present, we get feedback.

So I'll go with ""HARDY"".

But note: we might solve faster if we get lucky.

We have _ A R _ _

Possible solutions: Based on what we know, words like ""hardy"", ""barmy"", ""lardy"", ""fairy"" but ""fairy"" has F, A, I, R, Y? Wait, ""fairy"" is F A I R Y, so third letter is I, not R. Doesn't fit.

Another: ""marry"" as above, but with duplicate R.

Or ""carry"" but C excluded.

Or ""harry"" — H, A, R, R, Y → duplicate R.

""parry"" — P excluded.

""quarry"" — too long.

So five-letter: ""hardy"", ""barmy"", ""lardy"", ""tardy"" but T excluded? ""tardy"" has T? T(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) — T is excluded by guess2? Guess2: ""parts"" had T at position4 and marked as absent. So T is not in the word. Therefore, ""tardy"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""party"" has T.

So ""hardy"" is a good representative.

Therefore, let's guess ""HARDY"".Based on the cumulative feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"") feedback**: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  This indicates that:  
  - C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.  
  - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked ""-"" in positions 2 and 3, respectively).

- **Guess 2 (""parts"") feedback**: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x)  
  This indicates that:  
  - P, T, and S are **not** in the secret word.  
  - A is **correctly placed at position 2**.  
  - R is **correctly placed at position 3**.  

### Deduced information about the secret word:
The secret word must:  
- Be 5 letters long.  
- Have the pattern `_ A R _ _` (since A is fixed at position 2 and R at position 3).  
- Exclude the letters **C, E, N, P, T, S** (all marked absent in previous guesses).  
- Include only letters from the remaining pool: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  

### Strategy for the next guess:
- The goal is to test new common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 to narrow down possibilities.  
- We should avoid duplicating letters unnecessarily (though duplicates are possible if evidence suggests them), as there may be additional unknown letters.  
- Common letters not yet tested include **L, M, D, Y, H, O, U, B**—prioritizing these can maximize information gain.  
- Valid words fitting the `_ A R _ _` pattern without excluded letters include ""HARDY"" (tests H, D, Y), ""BARMY"" (tests B, M, Y), or ""LARDY"" (tests L, D, Y). ""HARDY"" is chosen because it uses high-frequency letters (H, D, Y) and is a common word.  

This guess will confirm or rule out H, D, and Y in their respective positions, bringing us closer to the solution.

Common letters in English include: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\nA good strategy is to try a word that has R and A in new positions and also tests other common letters.\n\nLet me brainstorm some words that meet the criteria:\n- Must include R and A (and not C, N, E).\n- Let\'s try to put R in position 1 and A in position 4, for example.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""RADAR"": But this has two R\'s and two A\'s. Also, we know only one R and one A? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. The secret word might have duplicate letters? But in the example, the word ""BRISK"" has no duplicates. However, we cannot rule out duplicates. But to be safe, let\'s avoid assuming duplicates until we have evidence.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one R and one A as present (and in wrong positions). If there were duplicates, we might have seen more? Actually, the feedback only marks each letter that is present. For example, if the word had two R\'s and one of them was in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a dash for the other if it\'s present but in the wrong place. But in our case, we only have one R and one A in the guess, and they are both present but in wrong positions. So the secret word has at least one R and one A. It might have more, but we don\'t know.\n\nTo keep it simple, let\'s try to use a word with unique letters for now.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that has R and A and also includes other common letters like S, T, L, O.\n\nLet me try to form such a word.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""ROAST"": But we have E excluded, and ROAST has O, A, S, T, and R. But wait, we have R in position 1 and A in position 3? But in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a dash meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, that would be the same position? We should avoid that. Also, we have R in position 1, which is a new position.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess says A is not in position 3, so if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\nTherefore, in the second guess, we should put A in a position that is not 3 (so 1,2,4,5) and R in a position that is not 2 (so 1,3,4,5).\n\nLet me try to list words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.\n\nSome options:\n- ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is valid because A was not in position 2 in the first guess? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3, so position 2 is new for A. Similarly, R was in position 2 in the first guess, now we put it in position 3, which is new. Also, we test P, T, Y.\n\n- ""TRAIL"": T, R, A, I, L -> R in position 2? But wait, in the first guess R was in position 2 and we got a dash meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting R in position 2. Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 3.\n\nIn ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 and A is in position 3. That\'s exactly the positions we must avoid. So that\'s not good.\n\n- ""BRAVO"": B, R, A, V, O -> R in position 2? Again, position 2 for R is bad.\n\nWe need to avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.\n\nSo let\'s try to put R in position 1 and A in position 4: \n- ""RAPID"": R, A, P, I, D -> but A is in position 2? That\'s okay because A wasn\'t in position 2 before. But wait, we have A in position 2 and R in position 1. However, we are testing A in a new position (2) and R in a new position (1). But note: the word ""RAPID"" has A in position 2 and R in position 1. Also, we test P, I, D.\n\nBut we must avoid C, N, E. ""RAPID"" doesn\'t have those.\n\nAnother option: ""ROARS"" -> but this has two R\'s? And A is in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.\n\nAnother: ""SAVOR"": S, A, V, O, R -> A in position 2, R in position 5. This is good because A is not in position 3 and R is not in position 2. Also, we test S, V, O.\n\nBut we don\'t know if S, V, O are in the word. This is a good candidate.\n\nAnother: ""TAROT"": T, A, R, O, T -> has two T\'s. A in position 2, R in position 3. This is okay for A (position 2 is new) and R (position 3 is new). But we have duplicate T.\n\nI think ""SAVOR"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places R and A in new positions.\n\nBut let me check if ""SAVOR"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to enjoy something.\n\nAnother common word: ""STARK"": S, T, A, R, K -> A in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.\n\n""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is acceptable because A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (new). Also, we test P, T, S.\n\n""PARTS"" is a valid word.\n\nNow, comparing ""SAVOR"" and ""PARTS"":\n- Both have A in position 2 and R in position 3? Wait, in ""SAVOR"": \n  S (1), A (2), V (3), O (4), R (5) -> so R is in position 5, not 3.\n\nIn ""SAVOR"", R is at the end. That\'s better because we haven\'t tested R in position 5 yet.\n\nIn ""PARTS"": \n  P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), S (5) -> R is in position 3 and A in position 2.\n\nWe haven\'t tested R in position 3 or 5, and A in position 2 is new.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we know it\'s not there. Now, if we put R in position 3, that\'s a new position. Similarly, A in position 2 is new.\n\nHowever, we might get more information from ""SAVOR"" because it tests more positions for R and A.\n\nBut let me think about the letters: \n- ""SAVOR"" tests S, A, V, O, R. \n- ""PARTS"" tests P, A, R, T, S.\n\nBoth are good. But we also want to test common letters. S and T are very common, so ""PARTS"" tests S and T, which are common. ""SAVOR"" tests V and O, which are less common.\n\nSo ""PARTS"" might be better because it tests more common letters.\n\nBut we already know that the word has R and A, so we are guaranteed to get some feedback on them. The other letters are the ones we are testing for presence.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to use a word that has R and A and also includes letters that are common and we haven\'t tested. We haven\'t tested S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\nIn ""PARTS"", we test P, A, R, T, S. We avoid C, N, E.\n\nIn ""SAVOR"", we test S, A, V, O, R.\n\nI think ""PARTS"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more.\n\nAnother word: ""RATIO"" -> R, A, T, I, O. But R is in position 1, A in position 2. This is good: R not in 2, A not in 3. And we test T, I, O.\n\nBut we have to avoid E, which we do.\n\n""RATIO"" is a common word.\n\nBut let me compare:\n- ""RATIO"": R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)\n- ""PARTS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)\n\nBoth are valid. But in ""RATIO"", we are testing I and O, which are vowels, and we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). But we don\'t know if it has more.\n\nI think ""PARTS"" is better because it tests S and T, which are more common than I and O? Actually, T is very common.\n\nBut let me look at letter frequencies. In English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E is out, and C and N are out. So remaining: A, R, I, O, T, S, L.\n\nWe have already tested A and R (and know they are in the word). We haven\'t tested I, O, T, S, L.\n\nSo testing T and S (as in ""PARTS"") is good because they are high frequency.\n\nAlternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R and A positions.\n\nWhat about ""STAIR"": S, T, A, I, R -> A in position 3? Not allowed.\n\n""ALERT"": but E is excluded.\n\n""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> R in position 2? Not allowed.\n\n""CRATE"": but C is excluded.\n\n""PLANT"": but N is excluded.\n\nSo back to ""PARTS"" and ""RATIO"".\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""PARTS"" because it tests S and T, which are very common, and it places R in a new position (3) and A in a new position (2).\n\nSo my second guess: PARTS\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PARTS"" is a valid English word.\n\nTherefore, the guess is ""parts"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: -, N: x, E: x), we know:\n- The secret word contains R and A, but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked as present but wrong position).\n- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n- R must be in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5) and A must be in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""parts"" because:\n- It includes R (now in position 3) and A (now in position 2), both in new positions to test their correct placement.\n- It avoids the excluded letters (C, N, E).\n- It introduces new common letters (P, T, S) to gather more information about their presence/absence and positions.\n- ""Parts"" is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>parts</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n1.

So the secret word has A in the second position.\n  R(✓) → R is correct at position 3. So the secret word has R in the third position.\n  T(x) → T not in word.\n  S(x) → S not in word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has A as the second letter and R as the third letter. So the word is: _ A R _ _\n- We also know from the first guess that the word contains at least one more letter that we don\'t know yet? Actually, we only know for sure the letters we have: A and R are fixed, and from the first guess, we knew R and A are present. Now with the second guess, we have them fixed.\n\nAdditionally, we know the absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S are not in the word.\n\nNow, we have two positions to fill: first and fourth, and fifth.\n\nWe need to think about the remaining letters that can be used. The word must be a 5-letter word without C, N, E, P, T, S.\n\nWe also remember from the first guess that the word has R and A (now fixed at positions 2 and 3) and possibly other letters.\n\nWe have three unknown positions: 1, 4, 5.\n\nWe must choose a guess that is a valid 5-letter word, has A in position 2 and R in position 3? But we don\'t have to fix them? Actually, we know they are correct, so any future guess must include A at position 2 and R at position 3 because we know they are correct. Therefore, our guess should have the form: ? A R ? ?\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use letters that we have not ruled out. The absent letters are: C, N, E, P, T, S. So the available letters are the rest of the alphabet.\n\nCommon letters that are available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to test as many common letters as possible in the unknown positions.\n\nWe have three positions to test: position 1, 4, and 5.\n\nWe can try a word like: _ A R _ _\n\nWe need to pick letters for positions 1, 4, 5 from the available set.\n\nGiven that we only have 4 tries left, we should aim for a word that tests common letters.\n\nLet me think of words that fit the pattern _ A R _ _\n\nSome examples:\n- BARNY: but N and Y? N is out (from guess1), so invalid because N is excluded.\n- HAREM: H, A, R, E, M → E is excluded? Guess1 said E is not in the word. So E is out. Invalid.\n- CAROL: C is excluded. Invalid.\n- DARKY: D, A, R, K, Y → no excluded letters? Let\'s check: D, A, R, K, Y. Available letters? Yes. But is ""DARKY"" a word? Not standard. Maybe not valid.\n- FARMY: F, A, R, M, Y → again, not sure if ""FARMY"" is a word.\n- Valid words: \n  - ""HARDY"": H, A, R, D, Y → H, D, Y are available. But we have positions: position 1: H, position 4: D, position 5: Y. So the word is H A R D Y.\n  - ""LARDY"": L, A, R, D, Y → LARDY is an adjective meaning like lard.\n  - ""MARLY"": M, A, R, L, Y → MARLY? Not common.\n\nBetter choices:\n- ""HARDY"" (meaning strong or durable) is valid.\n- ""MARRY"": M, A, R, R, Y → but this has two R\'s. We don\'t know if the word can have duplicate R? We know R is at position 3. But R could appear again? Let me see the feedback rules: each letter is marked individually. If there is another R, it would be considered. But we have no information yet about duplicate letters.\n\nIn our feedback for ""crane"", we only had one R and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""parts"", we had one R and it was correct. So if the secret word has only one R, that\'s fine. But if it has two, then we haven\'t tested for that.\n\nBut testing a duplicate in a guess is risky because if it\'s not present, we rule out that letter unnecessarily for other positions? Actually, if we test a letter again and it is not in the word, we get an \'x\'. If it is present and in the correct position, we get a check. If present but wrong position, a dash.\n\nBut in our case, for R: we already have one R correctly placed at position 3. So if we put another R in, say, position 1, then:\n- If the secret word has only one R, the extra R would be marked as \'x\' (absent for that position) meaning the actual R is already accounted for at position 3.\n- If the secret word has two R\'s, then it could be marked as dash if in the word but wrong position (if position 1 is not correct for a second R) or check if it is correct.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, perhaps we should avoid duplicates for now and choose a word with unique letters.\n\nSo ""HARDY"": H A R D Y → letters are H, A, R, D, Y. A and R are known, so we are testing H, D, and Y.\n\nSimilarly, ""BARDY"": B, A, R, D, Y → BARDY might not be as common.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- ""JARDY"": not a word.\n- ""WARDS"": but S is excluded. Invalid.\n- ""CARDS"": C excluded. Invalid.\n- ""HARLOT"": H A R L O T → too many letters? Should be 5-letter.\n\nSo limited options.\n\nBut we can consider words with O, L, etc.\n\nAnother one: ""HAREM"" has E which is excluded.\n\n""FARMY"" is not standard.\n\n""BARMY"": B, A, R, M, Y → BARMY (meaning crazy in British English). Valid? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""HARDY"" and ""BARMY"" are both options.\n\nAlso: ""LARVA"": L, A, R, V, A → has A again? Position 4: V, Position 5: A. But A is already known. Now, we are putting A again. So the letters: L, A, R, V, A.\n\nThis duplicates A. We don\'t know if the word has multiple A\'s? In position 5: if we put A, and if the secret word has a second A, it might be present.\n\nBut again, we want to test new letters.\n\nPerhaps it\'s better to avoid duplicates if we can.\n\nSo let me list some words that fit _ A R _ _ without duplicate A and without the excluded letters:\n\n- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y)\n- BARMY (B, A, R, M, Y)\n- LARKY (L, A, R, K, Y) → meaning? Prone to larks? Might not be common.\n- FARDY (F, A, R, D, Y) → obsolete word?\n- GARTH (G, A, R, T, H) → T is excluded? In ""parts"", T was marked absent, so T is not in the word. Therefore, GARTH has T — invalid.\n\nWe have to avoid T because it was ruled out by the second guess.\n\nSimilarly, S is excluded.\n\nAnother word: ""WARLY"" (W, A, R, L, Y) → WARLY means wary? Not standard; wary is 4 letters.\n\n""JARUL"" — not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""AARGH"" — but starts with AA, not the form. And G and H. Positions: A in position 2? But the first letter would be A? No, we need _ A R ... so the first letter is not fixed to A.\n\nAnother idea: ""OARED"" — O, A, R, E, D → E is excluded. Invalid.\n\nWithout E:\n\n- ""HARDY"" (as above)\n- ""BARMY""\n- ""MADLY"" — M, A, D, L, Y → but no R? We must have R at position 3? In ""MADLY"", it\'s M(1), A(2), D(3), L(4), Y(5) — so position 3 is D, not R. But we need position 3 to be R? So the word must have R at position 3. Therefore, the pattern is _ A R _ _.\n\nSo ""MADLY"" doesn\'t fit because the third letter is D, not R.\n\nWe must have the second letter A and third letter R.\n\nSo words: [letter1] A R [letter4] [letter5]\n\nAvailable letters: except C,N,E,P,T,S.\n\nCommon letters left: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nNow, let me find valid words:\n\n- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y) → valid word meaning resilient.\n- BARMY (B, A, R, M, Y) → valid, informal British English.\n- FARDY: not common, maybe not in dictionary.\n- LARDY (L, A, R, D, Y) → valid, meaning resembling lard or overweight.\n- WARBY? Not a word.\n- JARED: J, A, R, E, D → E excluded? Invalid.\n- HARKS: H, A, R, K, S → S excluded? Invalid.\n- DARK: too short.\n- PARK: too short.\n\nBetter: \n- ""DARKY"" — D, A, R, K, Y → offensive term, shouldn\'t use. Or not valid in word games?\n- ""MARRY"" — M, A, R, R, Y → has duplicate R. But we can consider: if we guess ""MARRY"", it would be M(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). Since we know position 3 is R and correct, the fourth R would be an extra. If the word has a second R at position 4, we\'ll get a dash or check? But we don\'t know if it has two R\'s.\n\nHowever, we want to test new letters, so duplicate R might not be efficient.\n\nAnother word: ""VARIA"" — V, A, R, I, A → form? But pattern: it is V A R I A → so positions: V(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), A(5). Here, we have duplicate A. And we test V and I.\n\n""VARIA"" is a valid word (plural of varium? or in biology). But rare.\n\nBetter to go with ""HARDY"" or ""BARMY"" or ""LARDY"".\n\nI think ""HARDY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters: H, D, Y.\n\nWe test H at position 1, D at position 4, Y at position 5.\n\nIf they are absent, we know. If present, we get feedback.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""HARDY"".\n\nBut note: we might solve faster if we get lucky.\n\nWe have _ A R _ _\n\nPossible solutions: Based on what we know, words like ""hardy"", ""barmy"", ""lardy"", ""fairy"" but ""fairy"" has F, A, I, R, Y? Wait, ""fairy"" is F A I R Y, so third letter is I, not R. Doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother: ""marry"" as above, but with duplicate R.\n\nOr ""carry"" but C excluded.\n\nOr ""harry"" — H, A, R, R, Y → duplicate R.\n\n""parry"" — P excluded.\n\n""quarry"" — too long.\n\nSo five-letter: ""hardy"", ""barmy"", ""lardy"", ""tardy"" but T excluded? ""tardy"" has T? T(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) — T is excluded by guess2? Guess2: ""parts"" had T at position4 and marked as absent. So T is not in the word. Therefore, ""tardy"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""party"" has T.\n\nSo ""hardy"" is a good representative.\n\nTherefore, let\'s guess ""HARDY"".Based on the cumulative feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"") feedback**: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  \n  This indicates that:  \n  - C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked ""-"" in positions 2 and 3, respectively).\n\n- **Guess 2 (""parts"") feedback**: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x)  \n  This indicates that:  \n  - P, T, and S are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - A is **correctly placed at position 2**.  \n  - R is **correctly placed at position 3**.  \n\n### Deduced information about the secret word:\nThe secret word must:  \n- Be 5 letters long.  \n- Have the pattern `_ A R _ _` (since A is fixed at position 2 and R at position 3).  \n- Exclude the letters **C, E, N, P, T, S** (all marked absent in previous guesses).  \n- Include only letters from the remaining pool: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  \n\n### Strategy for the next guess:\n- The goal is to test new common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 to narrow down possibilities.  \n- We should avoid duplicating letters unnecessarily (though duplicates are possible if evidence suggests them), as there may be additional unknown letters.  \n- Common letters not yet tested include **L, M, D, Y, H, O, U, B**—prioritizing these can maximize information gain.  \n- Valid words fitting the `_ A R _ _` pattern without excluded letters include ""HARDY"" (tests H, D, Y), ""BARMY"" (tests B, M, Y), or ""LARDY"" (tests L, D, Y). ""HARDY"" is chosen because it uses high-frequency letters (H, D, Y) and is a common word.  \n\nThis guess will confirm or rule out H, D, and Y in their respective positions, bringing us closer to the solution.\n\n<guess>hardy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: hardy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  Interpretation: 
    - C, N, E are not in the word.
    - R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 (as per their positions in ""crane"").

Guess 2: parts -> Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x)
  Interpretation:
    - P, T, S are not in the word.
    - A is correctly placed at position 2.
    - R is correctly placed at position 3.

Therefore, the secret word has A at position 2 and R at position 3, and the pattern is _ A R _ _

Guess 3: hardy -> Feedback: H(x), A(✓), R(✓), D(x), Y(✓)
  Interpretation:
    - H and D are not in the word.
    - A is still correct at position 2 (as expected).
    - R is still correct at position 3 (as expected).
    - Y is correctly placed at position 5? Let's check the positions of ""hardy"":
        Position 1: H, which is marked x (not present)
        Position 2: A, marked ✓ (correct)
        Position 3: R, marked ✓ (correct)
        Position 4: D, marked x (not present)
        Position 5: Y, marked ✓ (correct)

So the feedback shows Y is correct at position 5.

Therefore, we now know that the secret word ends with Y at position 5. The word pattern is _ A R _ Y.

Additionally, we have accumulated absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S, H, D.

So the known pattern is: [letter1] A R [letter4] Y

And excluded letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D.

We need to find a valid 5-letter English word that matches this pattern and does not contain any excluded letters.

Possible letters for position 1 and position 4 must come from the remaining letters: 
B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We also note that from Guess 1, we had R marked with ""-"" meaning R was present but not in position 2 (which we now know because it's fixed at position 3). Similarly, A was present but not in position 3 (and we now know it's at position 2). There are no other known constraints.

Now, let's think of words that fit _ A R _ Y.

Examples: 
- ""Fairy"" -> F, A, I, R, Y? But our pattern requires the third letter to be R, and ""fairy"" is F-A-I-R-Y, so third letter is I, not R. Doesn't fit.
- ""Harry"" -> excluded because H is absent? Also, H is excluded.
- ""Marry"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we have two R's. Pattern: M(1), A(2), R(3) -> correct, then R(4), Y(5). But Y is correct at position 5. Is ""marry"" allowed? But note that the fourth letter would be R. However, we have excluded many letters but R is already in the word (at position 3). We don't know if the word has a second R.

But we have to consider that if we fill position 4 with R, then the word becomes _ A R R Y. But that might be a valid word?

Words that fit:
- ""Marry"": M A R R Y -> first letter M, fourth letter R.
- ""Barry"": B A R R Y -> same pattern.
- ""Carry"": excluded because C is absent.
- ""Jarry"": J A R R Y? Is ""jarry"" a word? Not commonly recognized.
- ""Parry"": excluded because P is absent.

Other possibilities without duplicate R:
- ""Warty"": but W A R T Y -> T is excluded? Yes, T is absent. Invalid.
- ""Narky"": N is excluded? In guess1, N is absent. Invalid.
- ""Sparky"": S and P are excluded, and pattern would be S P A R K Y? Not matching _ A R _ Y because first two letters would be S P? Actually, no: for the pattern, we need first letter, then A at 2, R at 3. ""Sparky"" has S at 1, P at 2, A at 3? Doesn't match.

Let me list words matching _ A R _ Y that exist in English and are 5 letters.

Common words:
- ""Marry"": M A R R Y
- ""Barry"": B A R R Y (as a name, but it's accepted as a word)
- ""Harry"": H excluded? H is absent. Invalid.
- ""Tarry"": T excluded? Invalid.
- ""Lardy"": L A R D Y -> but D is absent? In ""hardy"", D was marked absent? Yes, D is excluded. So invalid.
- ""Fairy"": doesn't match because it's F-A-I-R-Y -> third letter is I, not R.

Without duplicate R:
- ""Carboy"": but C excluded? Also, pattern C A R ... -> third letter R, then B O Y? This would be 6 letters? No, carboy is 6 letters? Actually, C-A-R-B-O-Y is 6 letters.

Another: ""Barmy"": B A R M Y -> pattern fits: position 1: B, 2: A, 3: R, 4: M, 5: Y. And letters: B, A, R, M, Y.

Now, check against excluded letters: B, M, Y are not excluded? Excluded letters: C,E,N,P,T,S,H,D. So B, M, Y are allowed.

Similarly, ""barmy"" is a valid word (adjective, meaning foolish).

Also, ""marry"" is M,A,R,R,Y. We must check if the fourth letter R is allowed? We have R already at position 3. The secret word might have two R's. But if we guess a word with two R's, it's acceptable unless we have constraints against it.

But we have two candidates: ""marry"" and ""barmy"".

Are there others?
- ""Gawky"": G A W K Y -> but third letter W? Not R. Doesn't fit.
- ""Jazzy"": J A Z Z Y -> third letter Z? Not R.
- ""Mangy"": M A N G Y -> N excluded? Invalid.

So possible words: ""marry"" and ""barmy"".

We have already guessed ""barmy"" or something similar? We have not guessed ""barmy"" yet.

In guess3 we guessed ""hardy"". We haven't guessed ""barmy"".

But note: in ""barmy"", the pattern is B A R M Y. Position 4 is M.

In the secret word, we don't know if it has M.

Similarly, in ""marry"", position 4 is R.

How can we decide? We have 3 tries left (since this will be guess4).

We can choose to guess ""barmy"" because it tests M at position 4.

Alternatively, ""marry"" tests an extra R at position 4.

But we can also think: we know Y is at the end. And we need to solve the word.

We can choose a word that tests a different letter at position 1 and at position 4.

But note: we don't know what letter is at position 4 and position 1.

Since we have two possibilities (or more), we can try one that covers a letter we haven't tested.

In ""barmy"" we use B and M, both of which are new and not tested before.

Similarly, ""marry"" uses M at position 1? ""marry"" uses M and R (again). But we already know R is present at position 3; if we use R at position 4, we won't test a new letter at position 4.

Therefore, guessing ""barmy"" seems better because it tests two new letters: B and M.

If ""barmy"" turns out to be the word, we win. If not, the feedback will tell us about B and M.

So let's choose ""barmy"".

Also, note: we might have other words? Like ""warmly"" but that's 6 letters.

Or ""fury"" too short.

Another word: ""fairy"" does not fit because it requires R at position 4? But pattern is _ A R _ Y, so position 3 is R, position 4 must be filled.

""Airy"" is 4 letters.

So I think ""barmy"" is a strong candidate.

But let me confirm: is ""barmy"" a valid word? Yes, it is.

Therefore, we guess ""barmy"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are present but misplaced, while C, N, and E are absent. This shows R and A are in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3.
- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: A is correct at position 2, R is correct at position 3, while P, T, and S are absent. This confirms the secret word pattern is `_ A R _ _`.
- **Guess 3 (""hardy"")**: A and R remain correct at positions 2 and 3, Y is correct at position 5, while H and D are absent. This updates the secret word pattern to `_ A R _ Y` and rules out H and D.

### Deduced knowledge:
- **Fixed positions**: Position 2 = A, Position 3 = R, Position 5 = Y → Pattern: `[letter1] A R [letter4] Y`.
- **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D (8 letters total).
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
- **Unknowns**: Letters for positions 1 and 4 must be from the remaining pool.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., M, L, B, O, U) to maximize information gain.
- Use a valid English word that fits the pattern `_ A R _ Y` and avoids absent letters.
- Candidates include ""barmy"" (tests B, M, Y) or ""marry"" (tests M, duplicate R), but ""barmy"" is preferred to test new letters B and M in positions 1 and 4 simultaneously.
- If ""barmy"" is correct, we solve it; otherwise, feedback on B and M will reduce possibilities significantly.

<guess>barmy</guess>",barmy,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  Interpretation: 
    - C, N, E are not in the word.
    - R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 (as per their positions in ""crane"").

Guess 2: parts -> Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x)
  Interpretation:
    - P, T, S are not in the word.
    - A is correctly placed at position 2.
    - R is correctly placed at position 3.

Therefore, the secret word has A at position 2 and R at position 3, and the pattern is _ A R _ _

Guess 3: hardy -> Feedback: H(x), A(✓), R(✓), D(x), Y(✓)
  Interpretation:
    - H and D are not in the word.
    - A is still correct at position 2 (as expected).
    - R is still correct at position 3 (as expected).
    - Y is correctly placed at position 5? Let's check the positions of ""hardy"":
        Position 1: H, which is marked x (not present)
        Position 2: A, marked ✓ (correct)
        Position 3: R, marked ✓ (correct)
        Position 4: D, marked x (not present)
        Position 5: Y, marked ✓ (correct)

So the feedback shows Y is correct at position 5.

Therefore, we now know that the secret word ends with Y at position 5. The word pattern is _ A R _ Y.

Additionally, we have accumulated absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S, H, D.

So the known pattern is: [letter1] A R [letter4] Y

And excluded letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D.

We need to find a valid 5-letter English word that matches this pattern and does not contain any excluded letters.

Possible letters for position 1 and position 4 must come from the remaining letters: 
B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We also note that from Guess 1, we had R marked with ""-"" meaning R was present but not in position 2 (which we now know because it's fixed at position 3). Similarly, A was present but not in position 3 (and we now know it's at position 2). There are no other known constraints.

Now, let's think of words that fit _ A R _ Y.

Examples: 
- ""Fairy"" -> F, A, I, R, Y? But our pattern requires the third letter to be R, and ""fairy"" is F-A-I-R-Y, so third letter is I, not R. Doesn't fit.
- ""Harry"" -> excluded because H is absent? Also, H is excluded.
- ""Marry"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we have two R's. Pattern: M(1), A(2), R(3) -> correct, then R(4), Y(5). But Y is correct at position 5. Is ""marry"" allowed? But note that the fourth letter would be R. However, we have excluded many letters but R is already in the word (at position 3). We don't know if the word has a second R.

But we have to consider that if we fill position 4 with R, then the word becomes _ A R R Y. But that might be a valid word?

Words that fit:
- ""Marry"": M A R R Y -> first letter M, fourth letter R.
- ""Barry"": B A R R Y -> same pattern.
- ""Carry"": excluded because C is absent.
- ""Jarry"": J A R R Y? Is ""jarry"" a word? Not commonly recognized.
- ""Parry"": excluded because P is absent.

Other possibilities without duplicate R:
- ""Warty"": but W A R T Y -> T is excluded? Yes, T is absent. Invalid.
- ""Narky"": N is excluded? In guess1, N is absent. Invalid.
- ""Sparky"": S and P are excluded, and pattern would be S P A R K Y? Not matching _ A R _ Y because first two letters would be S P? Actually, no: for the pattern, we need first letter, then A at 2, R at 3. ""Sparky"" has S at 1, P at 2, A at 3? Doesn't match.

Let me list words matching _ A R _ Y that exist in English and are 5 letters.

- ""Barry"": B A R R Y (as a name, but it's accepted as a word)
- ""Harry"": H excluded? H is absent. Invalid.

- ""Lardy"": L A R D Y -> but D is absent? In ""hardy"", D was marked absent? Yes, D is excluded. So invalid.
- ""Fairy"": doesn't match because it's F-A-I-R-Y -> third letter is I, not R.

Without duplicate R:
- ""Carboy"": but C excluded? Also, pattern C A R ... -> third letter R, then B O Y? This would be 6 letters? No, carboy is 6 letters? Actually, C-A-R-B-O-Y is 6 letters.

Another: ""Barmy"": B A R M Y -> pattern fits: position 1: B, 2: A, 3: R, 4: M, 5: Y. And letters: B, A, R, M, Y.

Now, check against excluded letters: B, M, Y are not excluded? Excluded letters: C,E,N,P,T,S,H,D. So B, M, Y are allowed.

Similarly, ""barmy"" is a valid word (adjective, meaning foolish).

Also, ""marry"" is M,A,R,R,Y. We must check if the fourth letter R is allowed? We have R already at position 3. The secret word might have two R's. But if we guess a word with two R's, it's acceptable unless we have constraints against it.

But we have two candidates: ""marry"" and ""barmy"".

Are there others?
- ""Gawky"": G A W K Y -> but third letter W? Not R. Doesn't fit.
- ""Jazzy"": J A Z Z Y -> third letter Z? Not R.
- ""Mangy"": M A N G Y -> N excluded? Invalid.

So possible words: ""marry"" and ""barmy"".

We have already guessed ""barmy"" or something similar? We have not guessed ""barmy"" yet.

In guess3 we guessed ""hardy"". We haven't guessed ""barmy"".

But note: in ""barmy"", the pattern is B A R M Y. Position 4 is M.

In the secret word, we don't know if it has M.

Similarly, in ""marry"", position 4 is R.

How can we decide? We have 3 tries left (since this will be guess4).

We can choose to guess ""barmy"" because it tests M at position 4.

Alternatively, ""marry"" tests an extra R at position 4.

But we can also think: we know Y is at the end. And we need to solve the word.

We can choose a word that tests a different letter at position 1 and at position 4.

But note: we don't know what letter is at position 4 and position 1.

Similarly, ""marry"" uses M at position 1? ""marry"" uses M and R (again). But we already know R is present at position 3; if we use R at position 4, we won't test a new letter at position 4.

Therefore, guessing ""barmy"" seems better because it tests two new letters: B and M.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words.
 According to various sources, the most common letters in English words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible and also try to have a mix of vowels and consonants.

 I recall that ""ROAST"" is a good starting word because it has:
   R, O, A, S, T
 These are all common letters.

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also popular: C, R, A, N, E.

 Another one is ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

 I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N) and all are common.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

 But note: the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Let me write it in the required format.I need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to help identify letters in the secret word. 

After considering common starting words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" and ""ROAST,"" I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
- The letters C, R, A, N, and E are all high-frequency in English.
- This combination covers a broad range of possible matches, helping me narrow down the secret word efficiently with the first feedback.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". 
  Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the following properties:
- It is a 5-letter word.
- It contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
- The positions of R and A are not 2 and 3 respectively.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Does not contain C, N, or E (since they are not in the secret word).
- Includes R and A (to try to find their correct positions) and possibly other common letters.

We also want to try to place R and A in different positions than in the first guess (position 2 and 3).

Let's think about possible positions for R and A:
- R was in position 2 in ""crane"", so in the secret word, R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- A was in position 3 in ""crane"", so in the secret word, A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We should avoid using the letters C, N, E.

We can also try to include other common letters that haven't been tested yet. Common letters in English include: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

A good strategy is to try a word that has R and A in new positions and also tests other common letters.

Let me brainstorm some words that meet the criteria:
- Must include R and A (and not C, N, E).
- Let's try to put R in position 1 and A in position 4, for example.

Possible words:
- ""RADAR"": But this has two R's and two A's. Also, we know only one R and one A? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. The secret word might have duplicate letters? But in the example, the word ""BRISK"" has no duplicates. However, we cannot rule out duplicates. But to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates until we have evidence.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one R and one A as present (and in wrong positions). If there were duplicates, we might have seen more? Actually, the feedback only marks each letter that is present. For example, if the word had two R's and one of them was in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a dash for the other if it's present but in the wrong place. But in our case, we only have one R and one A in the guess, and they are both present but in wrong positions. So the secret word has at least one R and one A. It might have more, but we don't know.

To keep it simple, let's try to use a word with unique letters for now.

Another idea: use a word that has R and A and also includes other common letters like S, T, L, O.

Let me try to form such a word.

Possible words:
- ""ROAST"": But we have E excluded, and ROAST has O, A, S, T, and R. But wait, we have R in position 1 and A in position 3? But in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a dash meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, that would be the same position? We should avoid that. Also, we have R in position 1, which is a new position.

But note: the feedback for the first guess says A is not in position 3, so if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.

Therefore, in the second guess, we should put A in a position that is not 3 (so 1,2,4,5) and R in a position that is not 2 (so 1,3,4,5).

Let me try to list words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

Some options:
- ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is valid because A was not in position 2 in the first guess? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3, so position 2 is new for A. Similarly, R was in position 2 in the first guess, now we put it in position 3, which is new. Also, we test P, T, Y.

- ""TRAIL"": T, R, A, I, L -> R in position 2? But wait, in the first guess R was in position 2 and we got a dash meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting R in position 2. Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 and A is in position 3. That's exactly the positions we must avoid. So that's not good.

- ""BRAVO"": B, R, A, V, O -> R in position 2? Again, position 2 for R is bad.

We need to avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

So let's try to put R in position 1 and A in position 4: 
- ""RAPID"": R, A, P, I, D -> but A is in position 2? That's okay because A wasn't in position 2 before. But wait, we have A in position 2 and R in position 1. However, we are testing A in a new position (2) and R in a new position (1). But note: the word ""RAPID"" has A in position 2 and R in position 1. Also, we test P, I, D.

But we must avoid C, N, E. ""RAPID"" doesn't have those.

Another option: ""ROARS"" -> but this has two R's? And A is in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.

Another: ""SAVOR"": S, A, V, O, R -> A in position 2, R in position 5. This is good because A is not in position 3 and R is not in position 2. Also, we test S, V, O.

But we don't know if S, V, O are in the word. This is a good candidate.

Another: ""TAROT"": T, A, R, O, T -> has two T's. A in position 2, R in position 3. This is okay for A (position 2 is new) and R (position 3 is new). But we have duplicate T.

I think ""SAVOR"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places R and A in new positions.

But let me check if ""SAVOR"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to enjoy something.

Another common word: ""STARK"": S, T, A, R, K -> A in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.

""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is acceptable because A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (new). Also, we test P, T, S.

""PARTS"" is a valid word.

Now, comparing ""SAVOR"" and ""PARTS"":
- Both have A in position 2 and R in position 3? Wait, in ""SAVOR"": 
  S (1), A (2), V (3), O (4), R (5) -> so R is in position 5, not 3.

In ""SAVOR"", R is at the end. That's better because we haven't tested R in position 5 yet.

In ""PARTS"": 
  P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), S (5) -> R is in position 3 and A in position 2.

We haven't tested R in position 3 or 5, and A in position 2 is new.

But note: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we know it's not there. Now, if we put R in position 3, that's a new position. Similarly, A in position 2 is new.

However, we might get more information from ""SAVOR"" because it tests more positions for R and A.

But let me think about the letters: 
- ""SAVOR"" tests S, A, V, O, R. 
- ""PARTS"" tests P, A, R, T, S.

Both are good. But we also want to test common letters. S and T are very common, so ""PARTS"" tests S and T, which are common. ""SAVOR"" tests V and O, which are less common.

So ""PARTS"" might be better because it tests more common letters.

But we already know that the word has R and A, so we are guaranteed to get some feedback on them. The other letters are the ones we are testing for presence.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has R and A and also includes letters that are common and we haven't tested. We haven't tested S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

In ""PARTS"", we test P, A, R, T, S. We avoid C, N, E.

In ""SAVOR"", we test S, A, V, O, R.

I think ""PARTS"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more.

Another word: ""RATIO"" -> R, A, T, I, O. But R is in position 1, A in position 2. This is good: R not in 2, A not in 3. And we test T, I, O.

But we have to avoid E, which we do.

""RATIO"" is a common word.

But let me compare:
- ""RATIO"": R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)
- ""PARTS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)

Both are valid. But in ""RATIO"", we are testing I and O, which are vowels, and we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). But we don't know if it has more.

I think ""PARTS"" is better because it tests S and T, which are more common than I and O? Actually, T is very common.

But let me look at letter frequencies. In English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E is out, and C and N are out. So remaining: A, R, I, O, T, S, L.

We have already tested A and R (and know they are in the word). We haven't tested I, O, T, S, L.

So testing T and S (as in ""PARTS"") is good because they are high frequency.

Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R and A positions.

What about ""STAIR"": S, T, A, I, R -> A in position 3? Not allowed.

""ALERT"": but E is excluded.

""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> R in position 2? Not allowed.

""CRATE"": but C is excluded.

""PLANT"": but N is excluded.

So back to ""PARTS"" and ""RATIO"".

I think I'll go with ""PARTS"" because it tests S and T, which are very common, and it places R in a new position (3) and A in a new position (2).

So my second guess: PARTS

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PARTS"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the guess is ""parts"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: -, N: x, E: x), we know:
- The secret word contains R and A, but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked as present but wrong position).
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R must be in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5) and A must be in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).

For the second guess, I chose ""parts"" because:
- It includes R (now in position 3) and A (now in position 2), both in new positions to test their correct placement.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, N, E).
- It introduces new common letters (P, T, S) to gather more information about their presence/absence and positions.
- ""Parts"" is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>parts</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. Crane: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x) → so R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
2. Parts: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x) → now A is correct in position 2, and R is correct in position 3? Wait, let's see the positions.

Recall the positions in ""parts"":
  P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)

Feedback: 
  P(x) → P not in word.
  A(✓) → A is correct at position 2. So the secret word has A in the second position.
  R(✓) → R is correct at position 3. So the secret word has R in the third position.
  T(x) → T not in word.
  S(x) → S not in word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has A as the second letter and R as the third letter. So the word is: _ A R _ _
- We also know from the first guess that the word contains at least one more letter that we don't know yet? Actually, we only know for sure the letters we have: A and R are fixed, and from the first guess, we knew R and A are present. Now with the second guess, we have them fixed.

Additionally, we know the absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S are not in the word.

Now, we have two positions to fill: first and fourth, and fifth.

We need to think about the remaining letters that can be used. The word must be a 5-letter word without C, N, E, P, T, S.

We also remember from the first guess that the word has R and A (now fixed at positions 2 and 3) and possibly other letters.

We have three unknown positions: 1, 4, 5.

We must choose a guess that is a valid 5-letter word, has A in position 2 and R in position 3? But we don't have to fix them? Actually, we know they are correct, so any future guess must include A at position 2 and R at position 3 because we know they are correct. Therefore, our guess should have the form: ? A R ? ?

But note: we are allowed to use letters that we have not ruled out. The absent letters are: C, N, E, P, T, S. So the available letters are the rest of the alphabet.

Common letters that are available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many common letters as possible in the unknown positions.

We have three positions to test: position 1, 4, and 5.

We can try a word like: _ A R _ _

We need to pick letters for positions 1, 4, 5 from the available set.

Given that we only have 4 tries left, we should aim for a word that tests common letters.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern _ A R _ _

Some examples:
- BARNY: but N and Y? N is out (from guess1), so invalid because N is excluded.
- HAREM: H, A, R, E, M → E is excluded? Guess1 said E is not in the word. So E is out. Invalid.
- CAROL: C is excluded. Invalid.
- DARKY: D, A, R, K, Y → no excluded letters? Let's check: D, A, R, K, Y. Available letters? Yes. But is ""DARKY"" a word? Not standard. Maybe not valid.
- FARMY: F, A, R, M, Y → again, not sure if ""FARMY"" is a word.
- Valid words: 
  - ""HARDY"": H, A, R, D, Y → H, D, Y are available. But we have positions: position 1: H, position 4: D, position 5: Y. So the word is H A R D Y.
  - ""LARDY"": L, A, R, D, Y → LARDY is an adjective meaning like lard.
  - ""MARLY"": M, A, R, L, Y → MARLY? Not common.

Better choices:
- ""HARDY"" (meaning strong or durable) is valid.
- ""MARRY"": M, A, R, R, Y → but this has two R's. We don't know if the word can have duplicate R? We know R is at position 3. But R could appear again? Let me see the feedback rules: each letter is marked individually. If there is another R, it would be considered. But we have no information yet about duplicate letters.

In our feedback for ""crane"", we only had one R and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""parts"", we had one R and it was correct. So if the secret word has only one R, that's fine. But if it has two, then we haven't tested for that.

But testing a duplicate in a guess is risky because if it's not present, we rule out that letter unnecessarily for other positions? Actually, if we test a letter again and it is not in the word, we get an 'x'. If it is present and in the correct position, we get a check. If present but wrong position, a dash.

But in our case, for R: we already have one R correctly placed at position 3. So if we put another R in, say, position 1, then:
- If the secret word has only one R, the extra R would be marked as 'x' (absent for that position) meaning the actual R is already accounted for at position 3.
- If the secret word has two R's, then it could be marked as dash if in the word but wrong position (if position 1 is not correct for a second R) or check if it is correct.

But to avoid complexity, perhaps we should avoid duplicates for now and choose a word with unique letters.

So ""HARDY"": H A R D Y → letters are H, A, R, D, Y. A and R are known, so we are testing H, D, and Y.

Similarly, ""BARDY"": B, A, R, D, Y → BARDY might not be as common.

Other possibilities:
- ""JARDY"": not a word.
- ""WARDS"": but S is excluded. Invalid.
- ""CARDS"": C excluded. Invalid.
- ""HARLOT"": H A R L O T → too many letters? Should be 5-letter.

So limited options.

But we can consider words with O, L, etc.

Another one: ""HAREM"" has E which is excluded.

""FARMY"" is not standard.

""BARMY"": B, A, R, M, Y → BARMY (meaning crazy in British English). Valid? Yes.

Similarly, ""HARDY"" and ""BARMY"" are both options.

Also: ""LARVA"": L, A, R, V, A → has A again? Position 4: V, Position 5: A. But A is already known. Now, we are putting A again. So the letters: L, A, R, V, A.

This duplicates A. We don't know if the word has multiple A's? In position 5: if we put A, and if the secret word has a second A, it might be present.

But again, we want to test new letters.

Perhaps it's better to avoid duplicates if we can.

So let me list some words that fit _ A R _ _ without duplicate A and without the excluded letters:

- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y)
- BARMY (B, A, R, M, Y)
- LARKY (L, A, R, K, Y) → meaning? Prone to larks? Might not be common.
- FARDY (F, A, R, D, Y) → obsolete word?
- GARTH (G, A, R, T, H) → T is excluded? In ""parts"", T was marked absent, so T is not in the word. Therefore, GARTH has T — invalid.

We have to avoid T because it was ruled out by the second guess.

Similarly, S is excluded.

Another word: ""WARLY"" (W, A, R, L, Y) → WARLY means wary? Not standard; wary is 4 letters.

""JARUL"" — not a word.

Perhaps ""AARGH"" — but starts with AA, not the form. And G and H. Positions: A in position 2? But the first letter would be A? No, we need _ A R ... so the first letter is not fixed to A.

Another idea: ""OARED"" — O, A, R, E, D → E is excluded. Invalid.

Without E:

- ""HARDY"" (as above)
- ""BARMY""
- ""MADLY"" — M, A, D, L, Y → but no R? We must have R at position 3? In ""MADLY"", it's M(1), A(2), D(3), L(4), Y(5) — so position 3 is D, not R. But we need position 3 to be R? So the word must have R at position 3. Therefore, the pattern is _ A R _ _.

So ""MADLY"" doesn't fit because the third letter is D, not R.

We must have the second letter A and third letter R.

So words: [letter1] A R [letter4] [letter5]

Available letters: except C,N,E,P,T,S.

Common letters left: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Now, let me find valid words:

- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y) → valid word meaning resilient.
- BARMY (B, A, R, M, Y) → valid, informal British English.
- FARDY: not common, maybe not in dictionary.
- LARDY (L, A, R, D, Y) → valid, meaning resembling lard or overweight.
- WARBY? Not a word.
- JARED: J, A, R, E, D → E excluded? Invalid.
- HARKS: H, A, R, K, S → S excluded? Invalid.
- DARK: too short.
- PARK: too short.

Better: 
- ""DARKY"" — D, A, R, K, Y → offensive term, shouldn't use. Or not valid in word games?
- ""MARRY"" — M, A, R, R, Y → has duplicate R. But we can consider: if we guess ""MARRY"", it would be M(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). Since we know position 3 is R and correct, the fourth R would be an extra. If the word has a second R at position 4, we'll get a dash or check? But we don't know if it has two R's.

However, we want to test new letters, so duplicate R might not be efficient.

Another word: ""VARIA"" — V, A, R, I, A → form? But pattern: it is V A R I A → so positions: V(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), A(5). Here, we have duplicate A. And we test V and I.

""VARIA"" is a valid word (plural of varium? or in biology). But rare.

Better to go with ""HARDY"" or ""BARMY"" or ""LARDY"".

I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters: H, D, Y.

We test H at position 1, D at position 4, Y at position 5.

If they are absent, we know. If present, we get feedback.

So I'll go with ""HARDY"".

But note: we might solve faster if we get lucky.

We have _ A R _ _

Possible solutions: Based on what we know, words like ""hardy"", ""barmy"", ""lardy"", ""fairy"" but ""fairy"" has F, A, I, R, Y? Wait, ""fairy"" is F A I R Y, so third letter is I, not R. Doesn't fit.

Another: ""marry"" as above, but with duplicate R.

Or ""carry"" but C excluded.

Or ""harry"" — H, A, R, R, Y → duplicate R.

""parry"" — P excluded.

""quarry"" — too long.

So five-letter: ""hardy"", ""barmy"", ""lardy"", ""tardy"" but T excluded? ""tardy"" has T? T(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) — T is excluded by guess2? Guess2: ""parts"" had T at position4 and marked as absent. So T is not in the word. Therefore, ""tardy"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""party"" has T.

So ""hardy"" is a good representative.

Therefore, let's guess ""HARDY"".Based on the cumulative feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"") feedback**: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  This indicates that:  
  - C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.  
  - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked ""-"" in positions 2 and 3, respectively).

- **Guess 2 (""parts"") feedback**: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x)  
  This indicates that:  
  - P, T, and S are **not** in the secret word.  
  - A is **correctly placed at position 2**.  
  - R is **correctly placed at position 3**.  

### Deduced information about the secret word:
The secret word must:  
- Be 5 letters long.  
- Have the pattern `_ A R _ _` (since A is fixed at position 2 and R at position 3).  
- Exclude the letters **C, E, N, P, T, S** (all marked absent in previous guesses).  
- Include only letters from the remaining pool: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  

### Strategy for the next guess:
- The goal is to test new common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 to narrow down possibilities.  
- We should avoid duplicating letters unnecessarily (though duplicates are possible if evidence suggests them), as there may be additional unknown letters.  
- Common letters not yet tested include **L, M, D, Y, H, O, U, B**—prioritizing these can maximize information gain.  
- Valid words fitting the `_ A R _ _` pattern without excluded letters include ""HARDY"" (tests H, D, Y), ""BARMY"" (tests B, M, Y), or ""LARDY"" (tests L, D, Y). ""HARDY"" is chosen because it uses high-frequency letters (H, D, Y) and is a common word.  

This guess will confirm or rule out H, D, and Y in their respective positions, bringing us closer to the solution.

<guess>hardy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)
Guess 3: hardy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  Interpretation: 
    - C, N, E are not in the word.
    - R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 (as per their positions in ""crane"").

Guess 2: parts -> Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x)
  Interpretation:
    - P, T, S are not in the word.
    - A is correctly placed at position 2.
    - R is correctly placed at position 3.

Therefore, the secret word has A at position 2 and R at position 3, and the pattern is _ A R _ _

Guess 3: hardy -> Feedback: H(x), A(✓), R(✓), D(x), Y(✓)
  Interpretation:
    - H and D are not in the word.
    - A is still correct at position 2 (as expected).
    - R is still correct at position 3 (as expected).
    - Y is correctly placed at position 5? Let's check the positions of ""hardy"":
        Position 1: H, which is marked x (not present)
        Position 2: A, marked ✓ (correct)
        Position 3: R, marked ✓ (correct)
        Position 4: D, marked x (not present)
        Position 5: Y, marked ✓ (correct)

So the feedback shows Y is correct at position 5.

Therefore, we now know that the secret word ends with Y at position 5. The word pattern is _ A R _ Y.

Additionally, we have accumulated absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S, H, D.

So the known pattern is: [letter1] A R [letter4] Y

And excluded letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D.

We need to find a valid 5-letter English word that matches this pattern and does not contain any excluded letters.

Possible letters for position 1 and position 4 must come from the remaining letters: 
B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We also note that from Guess 1, we had R marked with ""-"" meaning R was present but not in position 2 (which we now know because it's fixed at position 3). Similarly, A was present but not in position 3 (and we now know it's at position 2). There are no other known constraints.

Now, let's think of words that fit _ A R _ Y.

Examples: 
- ""Fairy"" -> F, A, I, R, Y? But our pattern requires the third letter to be R, and ""fairy"" is F-A-I-R-Y, so third letter is I, not R. Doesn't fit.
- ""Harry"" -> excluded because H is absent? Also, H is excluded.
- ""Marry"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we have two R's. Pattern: M(1), A(2), R(3) -> correct, then R(4), Y(5). But Y is correct at position 5. Is ""marry"" allowed? But note that the fourth letter would be R. However, we have excluded many letters but R is already in the word (at position 3). We don't know if the word has a second R.

But we have to consider that if we fill position 4 with R, then the word becomes _ A R R Y. But that might be a valid word?

Words that fit:
- ""Marry"": M A R R Y -> first letter M, fourth letter R.
- ""Barry"": B A R R Y -> same pattern.
- ""Carry"": excluded because C is absent.
- ""Jarry"": J A R R Y? Is ""jarry"" a word? Not commonly recognized.
- ""Parry"": excluded because P is absent.

Other possibilities without duplicate R:
- ""Warty"": but W A R T Y -> T is excluded? Yes, T is absent. Invalid.
- ""Narky"": N is excluded? In guess1, N is absent. Invalid.
- ""Sparky"": S and P are excluded, and pattern would be S P A R K Y? Not matching _ A R _ Y because first two letters would be S P? Actually, no: for the pattern, we need first letter, then A at 2, R at 3. ""Sparky"" has S at 1, P at 2, A at 3? Doesn't match.

Let me list words matching _ A R _ Y that exist in English and are 5 letters.

Common words:
- ""Marry"": M A R R Y
- ""Barry"": B A R R Y (as a name, but it's accepted as a word)
- ""Harry"": H excluded? H is absent. Invalid.
- ""Tarry"": T excluded? Invalid.
- ""Lardy"": L A R D Y -> but D is absent? In ""hardy"", D was marked absent? Yes, D is excluded. So invalid.
- ""Fairy"": doesn't match because it's F-A-I-R-Y -> third letter is I, not R.

Without duplicate R:
- ""Carboy"": but C excluded? Also, pattern C A R ... -> third letter R, then B O Y? This would be 6 letters? No, carboy is 6 letters? Actually, C-A-R-B-O-Y is 6 letters.

Another: ""Barmy"": B A R M Y -> pattern fits: position 1: B, 2: A, 3: R, 4: M, 5: Y. And letters: B, A, R, M, Y.

Now, check against excluded letters: B, M, Y are not excluded? Excluded letters: C,E,N,P,T,S,H,D. So B, M, Y are allowed.

Similarly, ""barmy"" is a valid word (adjective, meaning foolish).

Also, ""marry"" is M,A,R,R,Y. We must check if the fourth letter R is allowed? We have R already at position 3. The secret word might have two R's. But if we guess a word with two R's, it's acceptable unless we have constraints against it.

But we have two candidates: ""marry"" and ""barmy"".

Are there others?
- ""Gawky"": G A W K Y -> but third letter W? Not R. Doesn't fit.
- ""Jazzy"": J A Z Z Y -> third letter Z? Not R.
- ""Mangy"": M A N G Y -> N excluded? Invalid.

So possible words: ""marry"" and ""barmy"".

We have already guessed ""barmy"" or something similar? We have not guessed ""barmy"" yet.

In guess3 we guessed ""hardy"". We haven't guessed ""barmy"".

But note: in ""barmy"", the pattern is B A R M Y. Position 4 is M.

In the secret word, we don't know if it has M.

Similarly, in ""marry"", position 4 is R.

How can we decide? We have 3 tries left (since this will be guess4).

We can choose to guess ""barmy"" because it tests M at position 4.

Alternatively, ""marry"" tests an extra R at position 4.

But we can also think: we know Y is at the end. And we need to solve the word.

We can choose a word that tests a different letter at position 1 and at position 4.

But note: we don't know what letter is at position 4 and position 1.

Since we have two possibilities (or more), we can try one that covers a letter we haven't tested.

In ""barmy"" we use B and M, both of which are new and not tested before.

Similarly, ""marry"" uses M at position 1? ""marry"" uses M and R (again). But we already know R is present at position 3; if we use R at position 4, we won't test a new letter at position 4.

Therefore, guessing ""barmy"" seems better because it tests two new letters: B and M.

If ""barmy"" turns out to be the word, we win. If not, the feedback will tell us about B and M.

So let's choose ""barmy"".

Also, note: we might have other words? Like ""warmly"" but that's 6 letters.

Or ""fury"" too short.

Another word: ""fairy"" does not fit because it requires R at position 4? But pattern is _ A R _ Y, so position 3 is R, position 4 must be filled.

""Airy"" is 4 letters.

So I think ""barmy"" is a strong candidate.

But let me confirm: is ""barmy"" a valid word? Yes, it is.

Therefore, we guess ""barmy"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are present but misplaced, while C, N, and E are absent. This shows R and A are in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3.
- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: A is correct at position 2, R is correct at position 3, while P, T, and S are absent. This confirms the secret word pattern is `_ A R _ _`.
- **Guess 3 (""hardy"")**: A and R remain correct at positions 2 and 3, Y is correct at position 5, while H and D are absent. This updates the secret word pattern to `_ A R _ Y` and rules out H and D.

### Deduced knowledge:
- **Fixed positions**: Position 2 = A, Position 3 = R, Position 5 = Y → Pattern: `[letter1] A R [letter4] Y`.
- **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D (8 letters total).
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
- **Unknowns**: Letters for positions 1 and 4 must be from the remaining pool.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., M, L, B, O, U) to maximize information gain.
- Use a valid English word that fits the pattern `_ A R _ Y` and avoids absent letters.
- Candidates include ""barmy"" (tests B, M, Y) or ""marry"" (tests M, duplicate R), but ""barmy"" is preferred to test new letters B and M in positions 1 and 4 simultaneously.
- If ""barmy"" is correct, we solve it; otherwise, feedback on B and M will reduce possibilities significantly.

Common letters in English include: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\nA good strategy is to try a word that has R and A in new positions and also tests other common letters.\n\nLet me brainstorm some words that meet the criteria:\n- Must include R and A (and not C, N, E).\n- Let\'s try to put R in position 1 and A in position 4, for example.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""RADAR"": But this has two R\'s and two A\'s. Also, we know only one R and one A? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. The secret word might have duplicate letters? But in the example, the word ""BRISK"" has no duplicates. However, we cannot rule out duplicates. But to be safe, let\'s avoid assuming duplicates until we have evidence.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one R and one A as present (and in wrong positions). If there were duplicates, we might have seen more? Actually, the feedback only marks each letter that is present. For example, if the word had two R\'s and one of them was in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a dash for the other if it\'s present but in the wrong place. But in our case, we only have one R and one A in the guess, and they are both present but in wrong positions. So the secret word has at least one R and one A. It might have more, but we don\'t know.\n\nTo keep it simple, let\'s try to use a word with unique letters for now.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that has R and A and also includes other common letters like S, T, L, O.\n\nLet me try to form such a word.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""ROAST"": But we have E excluded, and ROAST has O, A, S, T, and R. But wait, we have R in position 1 and A in position 3? But in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a dash meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, that would be the same position? We should avoid that. Also, we have R in position 1, which is a new position.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess says A is not in position 3, so if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\nTherefore, in the second guess, we should put A in a position that is not 3 (so 1,2,4,5) and R in a position that is not 2 (so 1,3,4,5).\n\nLet me try to list words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.\n\nSome options:\n- ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is valid because A was not in position 2 in the first guess? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3, so position 2 is new for A. Similarly, R was in position 2 in the first guess, now we put it in position 3, which is new. Also, we test P, T, Y.\n\n- ""TRAIL"": T, R, A, I, L -> R in position 2? But wait, in the first guess R was in position 2 and we got a dash meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting R in position 2. Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 3.\n\nIn ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 and A is in position 3. That\'s exactly the positions we must avoid. So that\'s not good.\n\n- ""BRAVO"": B, R, A, V, O -> R in position 2? Again, position 2 for R is bad.\n\nWe need to avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.\n\nSo let\'s try to put R in position 1 and A in position 4: \n- ""RAPID"": R, A, P, I, D -> but A is in position 2? That\'s okay because A wasn\'t in position 2 before. But wait, we have A in position 2 and R in position 1. However, we are testing A in a new position (2) and R in a new position (1). But note: the word ""RAPID"" has A in position 2 and R in position 1. Also, we test P, I, D.\n\nBut we must avoid C, N, E. ""RAPID"" doesn\'t have those.\n\nAnother option: ""ROARS"" -> but this has two R\'s? And A is in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.\n\nAnother: ""SAVOR"": S, A, V, O, R -> A in position 2, R in position 5. This is good because A is not in position 3 and R is not in position 2. Also, we test S, V, O.\n\nBut we don\'t know if S, V, O are in the word. This is a good candidate.\n\nAnother: ""TAROT"": T, A, R, O, T -> has two T\'s. A in position 2, R in position 3. This is okay for A (position 2 is new) and R (position 3 is new). But we have duplicate T.\n\nI think ""SAVOR"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places R and A in new positions.\n\nBut let me check if ""SAVOR"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to enjoy something.\n\nAnother common word: ""STARK"": S, T, A, R, K -> A in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.\n\n""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is acceptable because A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (new). Also, we test P, T, S.\n\n""PARTS"" is a valid word.\n\nNow, comparing ""SAVOR"" and ""PARTS"":\n- Both have A in position 2 and R in position 3? Wait, in ""SAVOR"": \n  S (1), A (2), V (3), O (4), R (5) -> so R is in position 5, not 3.\n\nIn ""SAVOR"", R is at the end. That\'s better because we haven\'t tested R in position 5 yet.\n\nIn ""PARTS"": \n  P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), S (5) -> R is in position 3 and A in position 2.\n\nWe haven\'t tested R in position 3 or 5, and A in position 2 is new.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we know it\'s not there. Now, if we put R in position 3, that\'s a new position. Similarly, A in position 2 is new.\n\nHowever, we might get more information from ""SAVOR"" because it tests more positions for R and A.\n\nBut let me think about the letters: \n- ""SAVOR"" tests S, A, V, O, R. \n- ""PARTS"" tests P, A, R, T, S.\n\nBoth are good. But we also want to test common letters. S and T are very common, so ""PARTS"" tests S and T, which are common. ""SAVOR"" tests V and O, which are less common.\n\nSo ""PARTS"" might be better because it tests more common letters.\n\nBut we already know that the word has R and A, so we are guaranteed to get some feedback on them. The other letters are the ones we are testing for presence.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to use a word that has R and A and also includes letters that are common and we haven\'t tested. We haven\'t tested S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\nIn ""PARTS"", we test P, A, R, T, S. We avoid C, N, E.\n\nIn ""SAVOR"", we test S, A, V, O, R.\n\nI think ""PARTS"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more.\n\nAnother word: ""RATIO"" -> R, A, T, I, O. But R is in position 1, A in position 2. This is good: R not in 2, A not in 3. And we test T, I, O.\n\nBut we have to avoid E, which we do.\n\n""RATIO"" is a common word.\n\nBut let me compare:\n- ""RATIO"": R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)\n- ""PARTS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)\n\nBoth are valid. But in ""RATIO"", we are testing I and O, which are vowels, and we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). But we don\'t know if it has more.\n\nI think ""PARTS"" is better because it tests S and T, which are more common than I and O? Actually, T is very common.\n\nBut let me look at letter frequencies. In English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E is out, and C and N are out. So remaining: A, R, I, O, T, S, L.\n\nWe have already tested A and R (and know they are in the word). We haven\'t tested I, O, T, S, L.\n\nSo testing T and S (as in ""PARTS"") is good because they are high frequency.\n\nAlternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R and A positions.\n\nWhat about ""STAIR"": S, T, A, I, R -> A in position 3? Not allowed.\n\n""ALERT"": but E is excluded.\n\n""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> R in position 2? Not allowed.\n\n""CRATE"": but C is excluded.\n\n""PLANT"": but N is excluded.\n\nSo back to ""PARTS"" and ""RATIO"".\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""PARTS"" because it tests S and T, which are very common, and it places R in a new position (3) and A in a new position (2).\n\nSo my second guess: PARTS\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PARTS"" is a valid English word.\n\nTherefore, the guess is ""parts"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: -, N: x, E: x), we know:\n- The secret word contains R and A, but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked as present but wrong position).\n- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n- R must be in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5) and A must be in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""parts"" because:\n- It includes R (now in position 3) and A (now in position 2), both in new positions to test their correct placement.\n- It avoids the excluded letters (C, N, E).\n- It introduces new common letters (P, T, S) to gather more information about their presence/absence and positions.\n- ""Parts"" is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>parts</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n1.

Wait, let\'s see the positions.\n\nRecall the positions in ""parts"":\n  P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)\n\nFeedback: \n  P(x) → P not in word.\n  A(✓) → A is correct at position 2. So the secret word has A in the second position.\n  R(✓) → R is correct at position 3. So the secret word has R in the third position.\n  T(x) → T not in word.\n  S(x) → S not in word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has A as the second letter and R as the third letter. So the word is: _ A R _ _\n- We also know from the first guess that the word contains at least one more letter that we don\'t know yet? Actually, we only know for sure the letters we have: A and R are fixed, and from the first guess, we knew R and A are present. Now with the second guess, we have them fixed.\n\nAdditionally, we know the absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S are not in the word.\n\nNow, we have two positions to fill: first and fourth, and fifth.\n\nWe need to think about the remaining letters that can be used. The word must be a 5-letter word without C, N, E, P, T, S.\n\nWe also remember from the first guess that the word has R and A (now fixed at positions 2 and 3) and possibly other letters.\n\nWe have three unknown positions: 1, 4, 5.\n\nWe must choose a guess that is a valid 5-letter word, has A in position 2 and R in position 3? But we don\'t have to fix them? Actually, we know they are correct, so any future guess must include A at position 2 and R at position 3 because we know they are correct. Therefore, our guess should have the form: ? A R ? ?\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use letters that we have not ruled out. The absent letters are: C, N, E, P, T, S. So the available letters are the rest of the alphabet.\n\nCommon letters that are available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to test as many common letters as possible in the unknown positions.\n\nWe have three positions to test: position 1, 4, and 5.\n\nWe can try a word like: _ A R _ _\n\nWe need to pick letters for positions 1, 4, 5 from the available set.\n\nGiven that we only have 4 tries left, we should aim for a word that tests common letters.\n\nLet me think of words that fit the pattern _ A R _ _\n\nSome examples:\n- BARNY: but N and Y? N is out (from guess1), so invalid because N is excluded.\n- HAREM: H, A, R, E, M → E is excluded? Guess1 said E is not in the word. So E is out. Invalid.\n- CAROL: C is excluded. Invalid.\n- DARKY: D, A, R, K, Y → no excluded letters? Let\'s check: D, A, R, K, Y. Available letters? Yes. But is ""DARKY"" a word? Not standard. Maybe not valid.\n- FARMY: F, A, R, M, Y → again, not sure if ""FARMY"" is a word.\n- Valid words: \n  - ""HARDY"": H, A, R, D, Y → H, D, Y are available. But we have positions: position 1: H, position 4: D, position 5: Y. So the word is H A R D Y.\n  - ""LARDY"": L, A, R, D, Y → LARDY is an adjective meaning like lard.\n  - ""MARLY"": M, A, R, L, Y → MARLY? Not common.\n\nBetter choices:\n- ""HARDY"" (meaning strong or durable) is valid.\n- ""MARRY"": M, A, R, R, Y → but this has two R\'s. We don\'t know if the word can have duplicate R? We know R is at position 3. But R could appear again? Let me see the feedback rules: each letter is marked individually. If there is another R, it would be considered. But we have no information yet about duplicate letters.\n\nIn our feedback for ""crane"", we only had one R and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""parts"", we had one R and it was correct. So if the secret word has only one R, that\'s fine. But if it has two, then we haven\'t tested for that.\n\nBut testing a duplicate in a guess is risky because if it\'s not present, we rule out that letter unnecessarily for other positions? Actually, if we test a letter again and it is not in the word, we get an \'x\'. If it is present and in the correct position, we get a check. If present but wrong position, a dash.\n\nBut in our case, for R: we already have one R correctly placed at position 3. So if we put another R in, say, position 1, then:\n- If the secret word has only one R, the extra R would be marked as \'x\' (absent for that position) meaning the actual R is already accounted for at position 3.\n- If the secret word has two R\'s, then it could be marked as dash if in the word but wrong position (if position 1 is not correct for a second R) or check if it is correct.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, perhaps we should avoid duplicates for now and choose a word with unique letters.\n\nSo ""HARDY"": H A R D Y → letters are H, A, R, D, Y. A and R are known, so we are testing H, D, and Y.\n\nSimilarly, ""BARDY"": B, A, R, D, Y → BARDY might not be as common.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- ""JARDY"": not a word.\n- ""WARDS"": but S is excluded. Invalid.\n- ""CARDS"": C excluded. Invalid.\n- ""HARLOT"": H A R L O T → too many letters? Should be 5-letter.\n\nSo limited options.\n\nBut we can consider words with O, L, etc.\n\nAnother one: ""HAREM"" has E which is excluded.\n\n""FARMY"" is not standard.\n\n""BARMY"": B, A, R, M, Y → BARMY (meaning crazy in British English). Valid? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""HARDY"" and ""BARMY"" are both options.\n\nAlso: ""LARVA"": L, A, R, V, A → has A again? Position 4: V, Position 5: A. But A is already known. Now, we are putting A again. So the letters: L, A, R, V, A.\n\nThis duplicates A. We don\'t know if the word has multiple A\'s? In position 5: if we put A, and if the secret word has a second A, it might be present.\n\nBut again, we want to test new letters.\n\nPerhaps it\'s better to avoid duplicates if we can.\n\nSo let me list some words that fit _ A R _ _ without duplicate A and without the excluded letters:\n\n- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y)\n- BARMY (B, A, R, M, Y)\n- LARKY (L, A, R, K, Y) → meaning? Prone to larks? Might not be common.\n- FARDY (F, A, R, D, Y) → obsolete word?\n- GARTH (G, A, R, T, H) → T is excluded? In ""parts"", T was marked absent, so T is not in the word. Therefore, GARTH has T — invalid.\n\nWe have to avoid T because it was ruled out by the second guess.\n\nSimilarly, S is excluded.\n\nAnother word: ""WARLY"" (W, A, R, L, Y) → WARLY means wary? Not standard; wary is 4 letters.\n\n""JARUL"" — not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""AARGH"" — but starts with AA, not the form. And G and H. Positions: A in position 2? But the first letter would be A? No, we need _ A R ... so the first letter is not fixed to A.\n\nAnother idea: ""OARED"" — O, A, R, E, D → E is excluded. Invalid.\n\nWithout E:\n\n- ""HARDY"" (as above)\n- ""BARMY""\n- ""MADLY"" — M, A, D, L, Y → but no R? We must have R at position 3? In ""MADLY"", it\'s M(1), A(2), D(3), L(4), Y(5) — so position 3 is D, not R. But we need position 3 to be R? So the word must have R at position 3. Therefore, the pattern is _ A R _ _.\n\nSo ""MADLY"" doesn\'t fit because the third letter is D, not R.\n\nWe must have the second letter A and third letter R.\n\nSo words: [letter1] A R [letter4] [letter5]\n\nAvailable letters: except C,N,E,P,T,S.\n\nCommon letters left: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nNow, let me find valid words:\n\n- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y) → valid word meaning resilient.\n- BARMY (B, A, R, M, Y) → valid, informal British English.\n- FARDY: not common, maybe not in dictionary.\n- LARDY (L, A, R, D, Y) → valid, meaning resembling lard or overweight.\n- WARBY? Not a word.\n- JARED: J, A, R, E, D → E excluded? Invalid.\n- HARKS: H, A, R, K, S → S excluded? Invalid.\n- DARK: too short.\n- PARK: too short.\n\nBetter: \n- ""DARKY"" — D, A, R, K, Y → offensive term, shouldn\'t use. Or not valid in word games?\n- ""MARRY"" — M, A, R, R, Y → has duplicate R. But we can consider: if we guess ""MARRY"", it would be M(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). Since we know position 3 is R and correct, the fourth R would be an extra. If the word has a second R at position 4, we\'ll get a dash or check? But we don\'t know if it has two R\'s.\n\nHowever, we want to test new letters, so duplicate R might not be efficient.\n\nAnother word: ""VARIA"" — V, A, R, I, A → form? But pattern: it is V A R I A → so positions: V(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), A(5). Here, we have duplicate A. And we test V and I.\n\n""VARIA"" is a valid word (plural of varium? or in biology). But rare.\n\nBetter to go with ""HARDY"" or ""BARMY"" or ""LARDY"".\n\nI think ""HARDY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters: H, D, Y.\n\nWe test H at position 1, D at position 4, Y at position 5.\n\nIf they are absent, we know. If present, we get feedback.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""HARDY"".\n\nBut note: we might solve faster if we get lucky.\n\nWe have _ A R _ _\n\nPossible solutions: Based on what we know, words like ""hardy"", ""barmy"", ""lardy"", ""fairy"" but ""fairy"" has F, A, I, R, Y? Wait, ""fairy"" is F A I R Y, so third letter is I, not R. Doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother: ""marry"" as above, but with duplicate R.\n\nOr ""carry"" but C excluded.\n\nOr ""harry"" — H, A, R, R, Y → duplicate R.\n\n""parry"" — P excluded.\n\n""quarry"" — too long.\n\nSo five-letter: ""hardy"", ""barmy"", ""lardy"", ""tardy"" but T excluded? ""tardy"" has T? T(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) — T is excluded by guess2? Guess2: ""parts"" had T at position4 and marked as absent. So T is not in the word. Therefore, ""tardy"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""party"" has T.\n\nSo ""hardy"" is a good representative.\n\nTherefore, let\'s guess ""HARDY"".Based on the cumulative feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"") feedback**: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  \n  This indicates that:  \n  - C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked ""-"" in positions 2 and 3, respectively).\n\n- **Guess 2 (""parts"") feedback**: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x)  \n  This indicates that:  \n  - P, T, and S are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - A is **correctly placed at position 2**.  \n  - R is **correctly placed at position 3**.  \n\n### Deduced information about the secret word:\nThe secret word must:  \n- Be 5 letters long.  \n- Have the pattern `_ A R _ _` (since A is fixed at position 2 and R at position 3).  \n- Exclude the letters **C, E, N, P, T, S** (all marked absent in previous guesses).  \n- Include only letters from the remaining pool: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  \n\n### Strategy for the next guess:\n- The goal is to test new common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 to narrow down possibilities.  \n- We should avoid duplicating letters unnecessarily (though duplicates are possible if evidence suggests them), as there may be additional unknown letters.  \n- Common letters not yet tested include **L, M, D, Y, H, O, U, B**—prioritizing these can maximize information gain.  \n- Valid words fitting the `_ A R _ _` pattern without excluded letters include ""HARDY"" (tests H, D, Y), ""BARMY"" (tests B, M, Y), or ""LARDY"" (tests L, D, Y). ""HARDY"" is chosen because it uses high-frequency letters (H, D, Y) and is a common word.  \n\nThis guess will confirm or rule out H, D, and Y in their respective positions, bringing us closer to the solution.\n\n<guess>hardy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: hardy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)\n  Interpretation: \n    - C, N, E are not in the word.\n    - R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 (as per their positions in ""crane"").\n\nGuess 2: parts -> Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x)\n  Interpretation:\n    - P, T, S are not in the word.\n    - A is correctly placed at position 2.\n    - R is correctly placed at position 3.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has A at position 2 and R at position 3, and the pattern is _ A R _ _\n\nGuess 3: hardy -> Feedback: H(x), A(✓), R(✓), D(x), Y(✓)\n  Interpretation:\n    - H and D are not in the word.\n    - A is still correct at position 2 (as expected).\n    - R is still correct at position 3 (as expected).\n    - Y is correctly placed at position 5? Let\'s check the positions of ""hardy"":\n        Position 1: H, which is marked x (not present)\n        Position 2: A, marked ✓ (correct)\n        Position 3: R, marked ✓ (correct)\n        Position 4: D, marked x (not present)\n        Position 5: Y, marked ✓ (correct)\n\nSo the feedback shows Y is correct at position 5.\n\nTherefore, we now know that the secret word ends with Y at position 5. The word pattern is _ A R _ Y.\n\nAdditionally, we have accumulated absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S, H, D.\n\nSo the known pattern is: [letter1] A R [letter4] Y\n\nAnd excluded letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D.\n\nWe need to find a valid 5-letter English word that matches this pattern and does not contain any excluded letters.\n\nPossible letters for position 1 and position 4 must come from the remaining letters: \nB, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z\n\nWe also note that from Guess 1, we had R marked with ""-"" meaning R was present but not in position 2 (which we now know because it\'s fixed at position 3). Similarly, A was present but not in position 3 (and we now know it\'s at position 2). There are no other known constraints.\n\nNow, let\'s think of words that fit _ A R _ Y.\n\nExamples: \n- ""Fairy"" -> F, A, I, R, Y? But our pattern requires the third letter to be R, and ""fairy"" is F-A-I-R-Y, so third letter is I, not R. Doesn\'t fit.\n- ""Harry"" -> excluded because H is absent? Also, H is excluded.\n- ""Marry"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we have two R\'s. Pattern: M(1), A(2), R(3) -> correct, then R(4), Y(5). But Y is correct at position 5. Is ""marry"" allowed? But note that the fourth letter would be R. However, we have excluded many letters but R is already in the word (at position 3). We don\'t know if the word has a second R.\n\nBut we have to consider that if we fill position 4 with R, then the word becomes _ A R R Y. But that might be a valid word?\n\nWords that fit:\n- ""Marry"": M A R R Y -> first letter M, fourth letter R.\n- ""Barry"": B A R R Y -> same pattern.\n- ""Carry"": excluded because C is absent.\n- ""Jarry"": J A R R Y? Is ""jarry"" a word? Not commonly recognized.\n- ""Parry"": excluded because P is absent.\n\nOther possibilities without duplicate R:\n- ""Warty"": but W A R T Y -> T is excluded? Yes, T is absent. Invalid.\n- ""Narky"": N is excluded? In guess1, N is absent. Invalid.\n- ""Sparky"": S and P are excluded, and pattern would be S P A R K Y? Not matching _ A R _ Y because first two letters would be S P? Actually, no: for the pattern, we need first letter, then A at 2, R at 3. ""Sparky"" has S at 1, P at 2, A at 3? Doesn\'t match.\n\nLet me list words matching _ A R _ Y that exist in English and are 5 letters.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""Marry"": M A R R Y\n- ""Barry"": B A R R Y (as a name, but it\'s accepted as a word)\n- ""Harry"": H excluded? H is absent. Invalid.\n- ""Tarry"": T excluded? Invalid.\n- ""Lardy"": L A R D Y -> but D is absent? In ""hardy"", D was marked absent? Yes, D is excluded. So invalid.\n- ""Fairy"": doesn\'t match because it\'s F-A-I-R-Y -> third letter is I, not R.\n\nWithout duplicate R:\n- ""Carboy"": but C excluded? Also, pattern C A R ... -> third letter R, then B O Y? This would be 6 letters? No, carboy is 6 letters? Actually, C-A-R-B-O-Y is 6 letters.\n\nAnother: ""Barmy"": B A R M Y -> pattern fits: position 1: B, 2: A, 3: R, 4: M, 5: Y. And letters: B, A, R, M, Y.\n\nNow, check against excluded letters: B, M, Y are not excluded? Excluded letters: C,E,N,P,T,S,H,D. So B, M, Y are allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""barmy"" is a valid word (adjective, meaning foolish).\n\nAlso, ""marry"" is M,A,R,R,Y. We must check if the fourth letter R is allowed? We have R already at position 3. The secret word might have two R\'s. But if we guess a word with two R\'s, it\'s acceptable unless we have constraints against it.\n\nBut we have two candidates: ""marry"" and ""barmy"".\n\nAre there others?\n- ""Gawky"": G A W K Y -> but third letter W? Not R. Doesn\'t fit.\n- ""Jazzy"": J A Z Z Y -> third letter Z? Not R.\n- ""Mangy"": M A N G Y -> N excluded? Invalid.\n\nSo possible words: ""marry"" and ""barmy"".\n\nWe have already guessed ""barmy"" or something similar? We have not guessed ""barmy"" yet.\n\nIn guess3 we guessed ""hardy"". We haven\'t guessed ""barmy"".\n\nBut note: in ""barmy"", the pattern is B A R M Y. Position 4 is M.\n\nIn the secret word, we don\'t know if it has M.\n\nSimilarly, in ""marry"", position 4 is R.\n\nHow can we decide? We have 3 tries left (since this will be guess4).\n\nWe can choose to guess ""barmy"" because it tests M at position 4.\n\nAlternatively, ""marry"" tests an extra R at position 4.\n\nBut we can also think: we know Y is at the end. And we need to solve the word.\n\nWe can choose a word that tests a different letter at position 1 and at position 4.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know what letter is at position 4 and position 1.\n\nSince we have two possibilities (or more), we can try one that covers a letter we haven\'t tested.\n\nIn ""barmy"" we use B and M, both of which are new and not tested before.\n\nSimilarly, ""marry"" uses M at position 1? ""marry"" uses M and R (again). But we already know R is present at position 3; if we use R at position 4, we won\'t test a new letter at position 4.\n\nTherefore, guessing ""barmy"" seems better because it tests two new letters: B and M.\n\nIf ""barmy"" turns out to be the word, we win. If not, the feedback will tell us about B and M.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""barmy"".\n\nAlso, note: we might have other words? Like ""warmly"" but that\'s 6 letters.\n\nOr ""fury"" too short.\n\nAnother word: ""fairy"" does not fit because it requires R at position 4? But pattern is _ A R _ Y, so position 3 is R, position 4 must be filled.\n\n""Airy"" is 4 letters.\n\nSo I think ""barmy"" is a strong candidate.\n\nBut let me confirm: is ""barmy"" a valid word? Yes, it is.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""barmy"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are present but misplaced, while C, N, and E are absent. This shows R and A are in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3.\n- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: A is correct at position 2, R is correct at position 3, while P, T, and S are absent. This confirms the secret word pattern is `_ A R _ _`.\n- **Guess 3 (""hardy"")**: A and R remain correct at positions 2 and 3, Y is correct at position 5, while H and D are absent. This updates the secret word pattern to `_ A R _ Y` and rules out H and D.\n\n### Deduced knowledge:\n- **Fixed positions**: Position 2 = A, Position 3 = R, Position 5 = Y → Pattern: `[letter1] A R [letter4] Y`.\n- **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D (8 letters total).\n- **Remaining possible letters**: B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n- **Unknowns**: Letters for positions 1 and 4 must be from the remaining pool.\n\n### Strategy for the next guess:\n- Prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., M, L, B, O, U) to maximize information gain.\n- Use a valid English word that fits the pattern `_ A R _ Y` and avoids absent letters.\n- Candidates include ""barmy"" (tests B, M, Y) or ""marry"" (tests M, duplicate R), but ""barmy"" is preferred to test new letters B and M in positions 1 and 4 simultaneously.\n- If ""barmy"" is correct, we solve it; otherwise, feedback on B and M will reduce possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>barmy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: hardy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: barmy -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(✓) M(-) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the fourth guess ""barmy"":
  B: absent (x)
  A: correct position (✓) at position 2
  R: correct position (✓) at position 3
  M: present but wrong position (-) at position 4? Let's see the positions.

In ""barmy"":
  Position 1: B → marked as absent (x)
  Position 2: A → correct (✓)
  Position 3: R → correct (✓)
  Position 4: M → present but wrong position (-)
  Position 5: Y → correct (✓)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word pattern remains: _ A R _ Y
- The letter M is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- Additionally, B is absent (added to the excluded list).

Now we update our knowledge:

Fixed positions:
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: R
  Position 5: Y

Letters present that are not correctly placed:
  M is present but not in position 4. So M must be in the secret word but not at position 4.

Absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B (from previous guesses)

Remaining available letters: F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

But we know M is present (just not in position 4), so M must be in the word. Therefore, M is in the word, but its correct position is not 4. Since we only have positions 1 and 4 left to find, M must be in position 1? Why? Because position 4 is the only other position besides position 1 that we don't know. And we know M is not in position 4 (as per feedback) so M must be in position 1? Not necessarily. We know M is not in position 4, and since position 2,3,5 are fixed, the only other position where M could be is position 1.

Therefore:
- Position 1 must be M? Because M is present and it cannot be in position 4? Actually, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Positions 2,3,5 are known and fixed: A, R, Y. So if M is in the word and not at position 4, then it must be at position 1? Because there are no other positions left? Wait, position 1 is the only unknown position left? No, we have two unknown positions: position 1 and position 4. But position 4 is not M? According to the feedback, M is in the word but not in position 4. It could be that position 1 is M? Or is there another possibility? But if M is in the word and not in position 4, and we only have position 1 and position 4 as variable, then position 1 must be M. Yes.

Therefore, the secret word must have M at position 1? Then what is at position 4? Position 4 must be a letter that is not M and not excluded? And since M is at position 1, then the word is M A R ? Y.

But then the feedback for ""barmy"": we guessed B at position 1 and got absent? Now we know that position 1 should be M, not B? And we have M at position 4? But we also got M marked as present but wrong position. So if M were at position 1? Then in the secret word, M is at position 1? But in our guess ""barmy"", we put M at position 4? And the feedback said M is present but not in position 4, meaning its correct position is elsewhere? It could be position 1? Then yes.

Therefore, we can conclude that the letter at position 1 is M? And the secret word is M A R ? Y.

But then the letter at position 4 is still unknown? And it must be a letter from the available set? But we know M is already at position 1, so position 4 must be another letter.

Moreover, we must not use excluded letters? And we haven't tested many letters? But wait? Do we know if there are duplicate M's? We have no evidence? But given the feedback? The feedback for ""barmy"": we got B absent (for position 1), then A and R correct, M present but not in position 4? Then Y correct. So after getting the M at position 4 flagged as wrong position, and since position 1 is the only other unknown position? But actually, position 1 is also variable? So why can't position 1 be something else and M be only at position 4? But the feedback says M is not at position 4? So if we place M at position 1 in the secret word, then in the guess ""barmy"", we had M at position 4? Then it would be marked as absent if M is only at position 1? Or as present? Wait: in the secret word, if M is only at position 1? Then when we put M at position 4? We get a dash? Because M is in the word but not in position 4? That matches? So if the secret word has M at position 1, then it's consistent with the feedback? If the secret word has M at position 4? Then we would have gotten a check? But we didn't? We got a dash? Meaning it's present but not at position 4? So it cannot be at position 4? Therefore, if M is at position 1? Then yes? But also? It could be at position 1? Given the unknown positions? So it must be at position 1? Therefore:

The secret word is M A R ? Y.

What can be the fourth letter? Position 4: must be a letter from the available set? Which is: F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? Without M? Because we already have M at position 1? And no duplicates? Unless? The secret word might have duplicate M? But we don't know? But let's assume no? Or wait: the feedback doesn't rule out duplicates? But we have no duplicate M? Because if there were a duplicate M? Then we didn't get any feedback that? We don't know? Actually, if we put M at position 4? And the secret word has M only at position 1? Then feedback would mark position 4 M as dash? Because it's in the word? But if it also had M at position 4? Then it would be marked as check? But we got a dash? Meaning M is in the word elsewhere? Not at position 4? So it doesn't necessarily imply that there is only one M? But if there were a duplicate? Then position 4 M might be marked as dash? Meaning the secret word has an M? But not at position 4? Then we don't know how many M's? Actually, it doesn't matter? Because we already know from this that there is an M at position 1? Because we have no other positions? Wait: if we assume the secret word has an M? And it's not at position 4? And positions 2,3,5 are fixed? Then it must be at position 1? So only one M? So there shouldn't be a duplicate? Therefore, position 1 is M? And position 4 is another letter? And that letter is not M? Because duplicate? Not necessary? But we don't know? However, we don't need to guess that? Because we can now guess a word starting with M? And A R at positions 2 and 3? Then some letter at position 4? And Y at position 5? So M A R ? Y.

Now, we need to choose the letter at position 4? But we have many choices? So we should try to test several possibilities? But how? We have one guess? That can only put one letter at position 4? So we need to narrow down? But we have 2 guesses left? Since this is guess 4? Then next is guess 5? Then guess 6? We have two attempts? We can try to find a common letter? Or we can try to test multiple letters? But it's hard?

Alternatively, we can think of valid English words matching M A R ? Y.

Possible words:
- ""Marly"" -> M A R L Y? Meaning? Like the place? But valid word.
- ""Marvy"" -> M A R V Y? Informal for excellent? Valid? Maybe not very common? But acceptable.
- ""Mary"" is 4 letters? Not.
- ""Mardy"" -> M A R D Y? But D is excluded. Invalid.
- ""Waray"" -> W A R A Y? Not matching? We need M at position 1? Pattern is M A R ? Y? So first letter M? Then A, R, then fourth letter, then Y.

Also? ""Marry"" is M A R R Y? But that has R at position 4? And we already have R? Is duplicate R allowed? But we haven't tested that? However, note that we know R is at position 3? So if we put R at position 4? It might be a duplicate? But in the feedback for guess 2? When we guessed ""parts""? We had R at position 3? And we got a check? Then for guess 3? ""hardy""? We had R at position 3? Check? So no duplicate? Or we don't know? Actually, we don't have any guess that tested R at position 4? So it could be that the secret word has a duplicate R? Or not?

In ""marry"": M, A, R, R, Y? So we have R at positions 3 and 4? Then position 3 R is fixed? Which we know is correct? Position 4 R would be part of the word? But in the feedback for ""barmy""? We had M at position 4? Which is dash? Meaning M is present but not at position 4? But we deduced that M must be at position 1? So if we put duplicate? But in ""marry""? There is no other M? Wait? ""marry"" does not have M? It has M at position 1? Then R at 3 and 4? Then Y at 5? So letters: M, A, R, R, Y.

But we have already concluded that position 1 must be M? Then position 4 is R? That is a duplicate R? This is possible? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Wordle does allow duplicates? So it's possible? But what about M? The M is at position 1? So if the secret word is ""marry""? Then position 1 M? Position 2 A? Position 3 R? Position 4 R? Position 5 Y? Then in the guess ""barmy"": 
  Position 1: B -> absent? Correct? Because secret has M? Not B.
  Position 2: A -> match.
  Position 3: R -> match.
  Position 4: M -> we guessed M? But secret has R? So M is not at position 4? Which is true? But is M in the word? Yes? At position 1? So M is present? But not at position 4? Therefore, we got a dash? Correct? And Y match? So yes? ""marry"" fits.

Similarly, we could have ""marly"": M A R L Y? Then position 4 is L? Which is an available letter.

Also, ""marked"" has 6 letters? Not.

And ""marvy"" as I thought? Is it ""marvy""? Informal? Meaning marvelous? Yes.

Other possibilities? ""maray""? Not a word? ""makay""? Not.

So the contenders are:
- ""marry"" (M A R R Y) → duplicate R? And we haven't ruled it out?
- ""marly"" (M A R L Y)
- ""marvy"" (M A R V Y)

But we must not use excluded letters? We don't have L, V? Etc? Excluded? No? They are in the available list? Because excluded letters: C,E,N,P,T,S,H,D,B? So L, V are allowed.

So three candidates? We need to choose one? And we have two guesses left? We might need more information?

But if we guess ""marly""? For example? Then:
- If it's the secret word? Success.
- If not? The feedback might tell us about L? And also we test M at position 1? Which we think is true? But actually? We deduced M at position 1? So let's check another possibility? What if the secret word has M at position 4? But we got a dash for M at position 4 meaning not there? So it can't be at position 4? So it must be at position 1? Almost? But what about if the secret word has M at some other position? But the only other position? Position 1? So yes.

Therefore, we must have M at position 1? So the word is M A R ? Y.

But then there are only 12 letters that ? at position 4 can be? So we need to guess.

Now, to maximize information? We can try a word that tests the least common? But we may want to try one of the words that is common.

Alternatively, we can list the possible words? We have 3: ""marry"", ""marly"", ""marvy""? But are there more?

- ""marey""? Not a word?
- ""mazey""? Meaning confusing? And Z is allowed? But pattern M A Z E Y? But third letter is Z? Not R! Must be R at position 3? So no.
- ""mary"": too short.
- ""murry"": meaning? Like? Not standard? M U R R Y? But first letter M? Then U? Then R? But position 2? Must be A? So A missing? No? Pattern is M A R ? Y? Position 2 must be A? So M A R then fourth letter? Then Y? So it must be ... ARY? Like? ""marsh"" is S excluded? And 5 letters? M A R S H? Excluded? And pattern? Position 5 H? But we need Y? So invalid.

Another: ""maply""? Not a word.

So common ones: ""marry"", ""marly"", ""marvy"".

We can also include ""jarry""? Or ""warly""? But less common.

Since ""marry"" has duplicate R? Let's see why it might be acceptable.

But let's consider that we haven't tested any letters at position 4? So we don't know what it is? So we must guess? And we have two attempts? We can start with one? For example? Guess ""marly""? To test if L is at position 4? If it works? Good? Else? We know L is not at position 4? Then we can try another? Like ""marvy"" next? Etc? But we have only two guesses.

Alternatively? We can choose a word that uses a common letter? But we don't know.

But note: we have feedback that told us M MUST be in position 1? So let's think of ""marry""? But if we guess ""marry""? Then:
- We put M at position 1: it should be ✓? And A and R at positions 2 and 3: ✓? Then R at position 4: if the secret word has R at position 4? Then ✓? But if not? Then it might be marked as dash? Or? But we know R is not at position 4? Because R is fixed at position 3? And we don't know if there is a duplicate? So if we put R at position 4? It could be:
  - If the secret word has only one R? Then R at position 4 would be marked as absent? But we know R is in the word at position 3? So we get an x? Meaning that letter at position 4 is not in the word? Or if it is a different letter? It would be dash if present?

This is confusing. Better to avoid duplicates in our guess? Because we already know M at position 1? So we can test a single letter at position 4? So we choose a word that has M at position 1? And a letter we haven't tested? So that if that letter is correct? We win? Else? We know it's another letter.

So let's choose ""marly"" to test L at position 4? Because L is common? Also? ""marvy"" has V which is less common? ""marry"" tests R at position 4? But we already know R? So it might not test a new letter? And might cause duplication issues.

Therefore, I'll go with ""marly"".Based on the cumulative feedback and deductions:

- **Pattern**: The secret word must be of the form `? A R ? Y`.
- **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B (9 letters total).
- **Present letters**:
  - M is in the secret word but not in position 4 (as per Guess 4: ""barmy"" had M marked ""-"" at position 4).
  - Since positions 2 (A), 3 (R), and 5 (Y) are fixed, and M is present but not at position 4, **M must be at position 1**. Thus, the secret word pattern is `M A R ? Y`.
- **Remaining unknown**: Only position 4 is unknown. Its letter must be from the unfiltered pool (F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) and not absent from prior guesses.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Test a valid English word fitting `M A R ? Y`, prioritizing common letters like **L** (in ""marly"") or **V** (in ""marvy""). 
- ""Marly"" (M A R L Y) is chosen because:
  - ""L"" is a high-frequency letter not yet tested.
  - It tests position 4 specifically with L.
  - If correct, game ends; if incorrect, feedback on L will reduce possibilities for the final guess.

Given the constraints, ""marly"" is a safe guess to optimize the remaining attempts.

<guess>marly</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3; C, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: A is correct at position 2, R is correct at position 3; P, T, S are absent. The pattern is `_ A R _ _`.
- **Guess 3 (""hardy"")**: A and R remain correct; Y is correct at position 5; H and D are absent. The pattern updates to `_ A R _ Y`.
- **Guess 4 (""barmy"")**: A, R, and Y are correct; B is absent; M is present but not in position 4. The presence of M and pattern constraints (fixed A, R, Y) force M to **position 1**, as it cannot be in position 4.

### Deduced knowledge:
- **Fixed pattern**: `M A R ? Y`  
- **Position 4 must be a letter not excluded**: Absent letters are C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B.  
- **Possible candidates** for position 4 include common letters like L, V, O, or U (from remaining pool: F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).  
- Valid words fitting the pattern include ""marly"" (tests L), ""marvy"" (tests V), or ""mary"" (invalid length; ""marry"" duplicates R).  

### Strategy for this guess:
- Test ""marly"" (M A R L Y) to check L at position 4—a high-frequency letter.  
- If incorrect, feedback on L (present/absent) will isolate position 4 options for the final guess.  

<guess>marly</guess>",marly,"We have the feedback from the fourth guess ""barmy"":
  B: absent (x)
  A: correct position (✓) at position 2
  R: correct position (✓) at position 3
  M: present but wrong position (-) at position 4? Let's see the positions.

In ""barmy"":
  Position 1: B → marked as absent (x)
  Position 2: A → correct (✓)
  Position 3: R → correct (✓)
  Position 4: M → present but wrong position (-)
  Position 5: Y → correct (✓)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word pattern remains: _ A R _ Y
- The letter M is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- Additionally, B is absent (added to the excluded list).

Now we update our knowledge:

Fixed positions:
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: R
  Position 5: Y

Letters present that are not correctly placed:
  M is present but not in position 4. So M must be in the secret word but not at position 4.

Absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B (from previous guesses)

Remaining available letters: F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

But we know M is present (just not in position 4), so M must be in the word. Therefore, M is in the word, but its correct position is not 4. Since we only have positions 1 and 4 left to find, M must be in position 1? Why? Because position 4 is the only other position besides position 1 that we don't know. And we know M is not in position 4 (as per feedback) so M must be in position 1? Not necessarily. We know M is not in position 4, and since position 2,3,5 are fixed, the only other position where M could be is position 1.

Therefore:
- Position 1 must be M? Because M is present and it cannot be in position 4? Actually, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Positions 2,3,5 are known and fixed: A, R, Y. So if M is in the word and not at position 4, then it must be at position 1? Because there are no other positions left? Wait, position 1 is the only unknown position left? No, we have two unknown positions: position 1 and position 4. But position 4 is not M? According to the feedback, M is in the word but not in position 4. It could be that position 1 is M? Or is there another possibility? But if M is in the word and not in position 4, and we only have position 1 and position 4 as variable, then position 1 must be M. Yes.

Therefore, the secret word must have M at position 1? Then what is at position 4? Position 4 must be a letter that is not M and not excluded? And since M is at position 1, then the word is M A R ? Y.

But then the feedback for ""barmy"": we guessed B at position 1 and got absent? Now we know that position 1 should be M, not B? And we have M at position 4? But we also got M marked as present but wrong position. So if M were at position 1? Then in the secret word, M is at position 1? But in our guess ""barmy"", we put M at position 4? And the feedback said M is present but not in position 4, meaning its correct position is elsewhere? It could be position 1? Then yes.

Therefore, we can conclude that the letter at position 1 is M? And the secret word is M A R ? Y.

But then the letter at position 4 is still unknown? And it must be a letter from the available set? But we know M is already at position 1, so position 4 must be another letter.

Moreover, we must not use excluded letters? And we haven't tested many letters? But wait? Do we know if there are duplicate M's? We have no evidence? But given the feedback? The feedback for ""barmy"": we got B absent (for position 1), then A and R correct, M present but not in position 4? Then Y correct. So after getting the M at position 4 flagged as wrong position, and since position 1 is the only other unknown position? But actually, position 1 is also variable? So why can't position 1 be something else and M be only at position 4? But the feedback says M is not at position 4? So if we place M at position 1 in the secret word, then in the guess ""barmy"", we had M at position 4? Then it would be marked as absent if M is only at position 1? Or as present? Wait: in the secret word, if M is only at position 1? Then when we put M at position 4? We get a dash? Because M is in the word but not in position 4? That matches? So if the secret word has M at position 1, then it's consistent with the feedback? If the secret word has M at position 4? Then we would have gotten a check? But we didn't? We got a dash? Meaning it's present but not at position 4? So it cannot be at position 4? Therefore, if M is at position 1? Then yes? But also? It could be at position 1? Given the unknown positions? So it must be at position 1? Therefore:

The secret word is M A R ? Y.

What can be the fourth letter? Position 4: must be a letter from the available set? Which is: F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? Without M? Because we already have M at position 1? And no duplicates? Unless? The secret word might have duplicate M? But we don't know? But let's assume no? Or wait: the feedback doesn't rule out duplicates? But we have no duplicate M? Because if there were a duplicate M? Then we didn't get any feedback that? We don't know? Actually, if we put M at position 4? And the secret word has M only at position 1? Then feedback would mark position 4 M as dash? Because it's in the word? But if it also had M at position 4? Then it would be marked as check? But we got a dash? Meaning M is in the word elsewhere? Not at position 4? So it doesn't necessarily imply that there is only one M? But if there were a duplicate? Then position 4 M might be marked as dash? Meaning the secret word has an M? But not at position 4? Then we don't know how many M's? Actually, it doesn't matter? Because we already know from this that there is an M at position 1? Because we have no other positions? Wait: if we assume the secret word has an M? And it's not at position 4? And positions 2,3,5 are fixed? Then it must be at position 1? So only one M? So there shouldn't be a duplicate? Therefore, position 1 is M? And position 4 is another letter? And that letter is not M? Because duplicate? Not necessary? But we don't know? However, we don't need to guess that? Because we can now guess a word starting with M? And A R at positions 2 and 3? Then some letter at position 4? And Y at position 5? So M A R ? Y.

Now, we need to choose the letter at position 4? But we have many choices? So we should try to test several possibilities? But how? We have one guess? That can only put one letter at position 4? So we need to narrow down? But we have 2 guesses left? Since this is guess 4? Then next is guess 5? Then guess 6? We have two attempts? We can try to find a common letter? Or we can try to test multiple letters? But it's hard?

Alternatively, we can think of valid English words matching M A R ? Y.

Possible words:
- ""Marly"" -> M A R L Y? Meaning? Like the place? But valid word.
- ""Marvy"" -> M A R V Y? Informal for excellent? Valid? Maybe not very common? But acceptable.
- ""Mary"" is 4 letters? Not.
- ""Mardy"" -> M A R D Y? But D is excluded. Invalid.
- ""Waray"" -> W A R A Y? Not matching? We need M at position 1? Pattern is M A R ? Y? So first letter M? Then A, R, then fourth letter, then Y.

Also? ""Marry"" is M A R R Y? But that has R at position 4? And we already have R? Is duplicate R allowed? But we haven't tested that? However, note that we know R is at position 3? So if we put R at position 4? It might be a duplicate? But in the feedback for guess 2? When we guessed ""parts""? We had R at position 3? And we got a check? Then for guess 3? ""hardy""? We had R at position 3? Check? So no duplicate? Or we don't know? Actually, we don't have any guess that tested R at position 4? So it could be that the secret word has a duplicate R? Or not?

In ""marry"": M, A, R, R, Y? So we have R at positions 3 and 4? Then position 3 R is fixed? Which we know is correct? Position 4 R would be part of the word? But in the feedback for ""barmy""? We had M at position 4? Which is dash? Meaning M is present but not at position 4? But we deduced that M must be at position 1? So if we put duplicate? But in ""marry""? There is no other M? Wait? ""marry"" does not have M? It has M at position 1? Then R at 3 and 4? Then Y at 5? So letters: M, A, R, R, Y.

But we have already concluded that position 1 must be M? Then position 4 is R? That is a duplicate R? This is possible? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Wordle does allow duplicates? So it's possible? But what about M? The M is at position 1? So if the secret word is ""marry""? Then position 1 M? Position 2 A? Position 3 R? Position 4 R? Position 5 Y? Then in the guess ""barmy"": 
  Position 1: B -> absent? Correct? Because secret has M? Not B.
  Position 2: A -> match.
  Position 3: R -> match.
  Position 4: M -> we guessed M? But secret has R? So M is not at position 4? Which is true? But is M in the word? Yes? At position 1? So M is present? But not at position 4? Therefore, we got a dash? Correct? And Y match? So yes? ""marry"" fits.

Similarly, we could have ""marly"": M A R L Y? Then position 4 is L? Which is an available letter.

Also, ""marked"" has 6 letters? Not.

And ""marvy"" as I thought? Is it ""marvy""? Informal? Meaning marvelous? Yes.

Other possibilities? ""maray""? Not a word? ""makay""? Not.

So the contenders are:
- ""marry"" (M A R R Y) → duplicate R? And we haven't ruled it out?
- ""marly"" (M A R L Y)
- ""marvy"" (M A R V Y)

But we must not use excluded letters? We don't have L, V? Etc? Excluded? No? They are in the available list? Because excluded letters: C,E,N,P,T,S,H,D,B? So L, V are allowed.

So three candidates? We need to choose one? And we have two guesses left? We might need more information?

But if we guess ""marly""? For example? Then:
- If it's the secret word? Success.
- If not? The feedback might tell us about L? And also we test M at position 1? Which we think is true? But actually? We deduced M at position 1? So let's check another possibility? What if the secret word has M at position 4? But we got a dash for M at position 4 meaning not there? So it can't be at position 4? So it must be at position 1? Almost? But what about if the secret word has M at some other position? But the only other position? Position 1? So yes.

Therefore, we must have M at position 1? So the word is M A R ? Y.

But then there are only 12 letters that ? at position 4 can be? So we need to guess.

Now, to maximize information? We can try a word that tests the least common? But we may want to try one of the words that is common.

Alternatively, we can list the possible words? We have 3: ""marry"", ""marly"", ""marvy""? But are there more?

- ""marey""? Not a word?
- ""mazey""? Meaning confusing? And Z is allowed? But pattern M A Z E Y? But third letter is Z? Not R! Must be R at position 3? So no.
- ""mary"": too short.
- ""murry"": meaning? Like? Not standard? M U R R Y? But first letter M? Then U? Then R? But position 2? Must be A? So A missing? No? Pattern is M A R ? Y? Position 2 must be A? So M A R then fourth letter? Then Y? So it must be ... ARY? Like? ""marsh"" is S excluded? And 5 letters? M A R S H? Excluded? And pattern? Position 5 H? But we need Y? So invalid.

Another: ""maply""? Not a word.

So common ones: ""marry"", ""marly"", ""marvy"".

We can also include ""jarry""? Or ""warly""? But less common.

Since ""marry"" has duplicate R? Let's see why it might be acceptable.

But let's consider that we haven't tested any letters at position 4? So we don't know what it is? So we must guess? And we have two attempts? We can start with one? For example? Guess ""marly""? To test if L is at position 4? If it works? Good? Else? We know L is not at position 4? Then we can try another? Like ""marvy"" next? Etc? But we have only two guesses.

Alternatively? We can choose a word that uses a common letter? But we don't know.

But note: we have feedback that told us M MUST be in position 1? So let's think of ""marry""? But if we guess ""marry""? Then:
- We put M at position 1: it should be ✓? And A and R at positions 2 and 3: ✓? Then R at position 4: if the secret word has R at position 4? Then ✓? But if not? Then it might be marked as dash? Or? But we know R is not at position 4? Because R is fixed at position 3? And we don't know if there is a duplicate? So if we put R at position 4? It could be:
  - If the secret word has only one R? Then R at position 4 would be marked as absent? But we know R is in the word at position 3? So we get an x? Meaning that letter at position 4 is not in the word? Or if it is a different letter? It would be dash if present?

This is confusing. Better to avoid duplicates in our guess? Because we already know M at position 1? So we can test a single letter at position 4? So we choose a word that has M at position 1? And a letter we haven't tested? So that if that letter is correct? We win? Else? We know it's another letter.

So let's choose ""marly"" to test L at position 4? Because L is common? Also? ""marvy"" has V which is less common? ""marry"" tests R at position 4? But we already know R? So it might not test a new letter? And might cause duplication issues.

Therefore, I'll go with ""marly"".Based on the cumulative feedback and deductions:

- **Pattern**: The secret word must be of the form `? A R ? Y`.
- **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B (9 letters total).
- **Present letters**:
  - M is in the secret word but not in position 4 (as per Guess 4: ""barmy"" had M marked ""-"" at position 4).
  - Since positions 2 (A), 3 (R), and 5 (Y) are fixed, and M is present but not at position 4, **M must be at position 1**. Thus, the secret word pattern is `M A R ? Y`.
- **Remaining unknown**: Only position 4 is unknown. Its letter must be from the unfiltered pool (F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) and not absent from prior guesses.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Test a valid English word fitting `M A R ? Y`, prioritizing common letters like **L** (in ""marly"") or **V** (in ""marvy""). 
- ""Marly"" (M A R L Y) is chosen because:
  - ""L"" is a high-frequency letter not yet tested.
  - It tests position 4 specifically with L.
  - If correct, game ends; if incorrect, feedback on L will reduce possibilities for the final guess.

Given the constraints, ""marly"" is a safe guess to optimize the remaining attempts.

<guess>marly</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3; C, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: A is correct at position 2, R is correct at position 3; P, T, S are absent. The pattern is `_ A R _ _`.
- **Guess 3 (""hardy"")**: A and R remain correct; Y is correct at position 5; H and D are absent. The pattern updates to `_ A R _ Y`.
- **Guess 4 (""barmy"")**: A, R, and Y are correct; B is absent; M is present but not in position 4. The presence of M and pattern constraints (fixed A, R, Y) force M to **position 1**, as it cannot be in position 4.

### Deduced knowledge:
- **Fixed pattern**: `M A R ? Y`  
- **Position 4 must be a letter not excluded**: Absent letters are C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B.  
- **Possible candidates** for position 4 include common letters like L, V, O, or U (from remaining pool: F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).  
- Valid words fitting the pattern include ""marly"" (tests L), ""marvy"" (tests V), or ""mary"" (invalid length; ""marry"" duplicates R).  

### Strategy for this guess:
- Test ""marly"" (M A R L Y) to check L at position 4—a high-frequency letter.  
- If incorrect, feedback on L (present/absent) will isolate position 4 options for the final guess.",Guess 5: marly -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the frequency of letters in 5-letter English words.
 According to various sources, the most common letters in English words are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible and also try to have a mix of vowels and consonants.

 I recall that ""ROAST"" is a good starting word because it has:
   R, O, A, S, T
 These are all common letters.

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also popular: C, R, A, N, E.

 Another one is ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E.

 I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N) and all are common.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

 But note: the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

 Let me write it in the required format.I need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to help identify letters in the secret word. 

After considering common starting words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" and ""ROAST,"" I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).
- The letters C, R, A, N, and E are all high-frequency in English.
- This combination covers a broad range of possible matches, helping me narrow down the secret word efficiently with the first feedback.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". 
  Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the following properties:
- It is a 5-letter word.
- It contains R and A, but not C, N, or E.
- The positions of R and A are not 2 and 3 respectively.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Does not contain C, N, or E (since they are not in the secret word).
- Includes R and A (to try to find their correct positions) and possibly other common letters.

We also want to try to place R and A in different positions than in the first guess (position 2 and 3).

Let's think about possible positions for R and A:
- R was in position 2 in ""crane"", so in the secret word, R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- A was in position 3 in ""crane"", so in the secret word, A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We should avoid using the letters C, N, E.

We can also try to include other common letters that haven't been tested yet. Common letters in English include: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

A good strategy is to try a word that has R and A in new positions and also tests other common letters.

Let me brainstorm some words that meet the criteria:
- Must include R and A (and not C, N, E).
- Let's try to put R in position 1 and A in position 4, for example.

Possible words:
- ""RADAR"": But this has two R's and two A's. Also, we know only one R and one A? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. The secret word might have duplicate letters? But in the example, the word ""BRISK"" has no duplicates. However, we cannot rule out duplicates. But to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates until we have evidence.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one R and one A as present (and in wrong positions). If there were duplicates, we might have seen more? Actually, the feedback only marks each letter that is present. For example, if the word had two R's and one of them was in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a dash for the other if it's present but in the wrong place. But in our case, we only have one R and one A in the guess, and they are both present but in wrong positions. So the secret word has at least one R and one A. It might have more, but we don't know.

To keep it simple, let's try to use a word with unique letters for now.

Another idea: use a word that has R and A and also includes other common letters like S, T, L, O.

Let me try to form such a word.

Possible words:
- ""ROAST"": But we have E excluded, and ROAST has O, A, S, T, and R. But wait, we have R in position 1 and A in position 3? But in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a dash meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, that would be the same position? We should avoid that. Also, we have R in position 1, which is a new position.

But note: the feedback for the first guess says A is not in position 3, so if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.

Therefore, in the second guess, we should put A in a position that is not 3 (so 1,2,4,5) and R in a position that is not 2 (so 1,3,4,5).

Let me try to list words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

Some options:
- ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is valid because A was not in position 2 in the first guess? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3, so position 2 is new for A. Similarly, R was in position 2 in the first guess, now we put it in position 3, which is new. Also, we test P, T, Y.

- ""TRAIL"": T, R, A, I, L -> R in position 2? But wait, in the first guess R was in position 2 and we got a dash meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting R in position 2. Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 and A is in position 3. That's exactly the positions we must avoid. So that's not good.

- ""BRAVO"": B, R, A, V, O -> R in position 2? Again, position 2 for R is bad.

We need to avoid position 2 for R and position 3 for A.

So let's try to put R in position 1 and A in position 4: 
- ""RAPID"": R, A, P, I, D -> but A is in position 2? That's okay because A wasn't in position 2 before. But wait, we have A in position 2 and R in position 1. However, we are testing A in a new position (2) and R in a new position (1). But note: the word ""RAPID"" has A in position 2 and R in position 1. Also, we test P, I, D.

But we must avoid C, N, E. ""RAPID"" doesn't have those.

Another option: ""ROARS"" -> but this has two R's? And A is in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.

Another: ""SAVOR"": S, A, V, O, R -> A in position 2, R in position 5. This is good because A is not in position 3 and R is not in position 2. Also, we test S, V, O.

But we don't know if S, V, O are in the word. This is a good candidate.

Another: ""TAROT"": T, A, R, O, T -> has two T's. A in position 2, R in position 3. This is okay for A (position 2 is new) and R (position 3 is new). But we have duplicate T.

I think ""SAVOR"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places R and A in new positions.

But let me check if ""SAVOR"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to enjoy something.

Another common word: ""STARK"": S, T, A, R, K -> A in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.

""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is acceptable because A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (new). Also, we test P, T, S.

""PARTS"" is a valid word.

Now, comparing ""SAVOR"" and ""PARTS"":
- Both have A in position 2 and R in position 3? Wait, in ""SAVOR"": 
  S (1), A (2), V (3), O (4), R (5) -> so R is in position 5, not 3.

In ""SAVOR"", R is at the end. That's better because we haven't tested R in position 5 yet.

In ""PARTS"": 
  P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), S (5) -> R is in position 3 and A in position 2.

We haven't tested R in position 3 or 5, and A in position 2 is new.

But note: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we know it's not there. Now, if we put R in position 3, that's a new position. Similarly, A in position 2 is new.

However, we might get more information from ""SAVOR"" because it tests more positions for R and A.

But let me think about the letters: 
- ""SAVOR"" tests S, A, V, O, R. 
- ""PARTS"" tests P, A, R, T, S.

Both are good. But we also want to test common letters. S and T are very common, so ""PARTS"" tests S and T, which are common. ""SAVOR"" tests V and O, which are less common.

So ""PARTS"" might be better because it tests more common letters.

But we already know that the word has R and A, so we are guaranteed to get some feedback on them. The other letters are the ones we are testing for presence.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has R and A and also includes letters that are common and we haven't tested. We haven't tested S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

In ""PARTS"", we test P, A, R, T, S. We avoid C, N, E.

In ""SAVOR"", we test S, A, V, O, R.

I think ""PARTS"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more.

Another word: ""RATIO"" -> R, A, T, I, O. But R is in position 1, A in position 2. This is good: R not in 2, A not in 3. And we test T, I, O.

But we have to avoid E, which we do.

""RATIO"" is a common word.

But let me compare:
- ""RATIO"": R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)
- ""PARTS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)

Both are valid. But in ""RATIO"", we are testing I and O, which are vowels, and we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). But we don't know if it has more.

I think ""PARTS"" is better because it tests S and T, which are more common than I and O? Actually, T is very common.

But let me look at letter frequencies. In English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E is out, and C and N are out. So remaining: A, R, I, O, T, S, L.

We have already tested A and R (and know they are in the word). We haven't tested I, O, T, S, L.

So testing T and S (as in ""PARTS"") is good because they are high frequency.

Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R and A positions.

What about ""STAIR"": S, T, A, I, R -> A in position 3? Not allowed.

""ALERT"": but E is excluded.

""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> R in position 2? Not allowed.

""CRATE"": but C is excluded.

""PLANT"": but N is excluded.

So back to ""PARTS"" and ""RATIO"".

I think I'll go with ""PARTS"" because it tests S and T, which are very common, and it places R in a new position (3) and A in a new position (2).

So my second guess: PARTS

But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PARTS"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, the guess is ""parts"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: -, N: x, E: x), we know:
- The secret word contains R and A, but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked as present but wrong position).
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- R must be in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5) and A must be in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).

For the second guess, I chose ""parts"" because:
- It includes R (now in position 3) and A (now in position 2), both in new positions to test their correct placement.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, N, E).
- It introduces new common letters (P, T, S) to gather more information about their presence/absence and positions.
- ""Parts"" is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>parts</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. Crane: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x) → so R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
2. Parts: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x) → now A is correct in position 2, and R is correct in position 3? Wait, let's see the positions.

Recall the positions in ""parts"":
  P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)

Feedback: 
  P(x) → P not in word.
  A(✓) → A is correct at position 2. So the secret word has A in the second position.
  R(✓) → R is correct at position 3. So the secret word has R in the third position.
  T(x) → T not in word.
  S(x) → S not in word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has A as the second letter and R as the third letter. So the word is: _ A R _ _
- We also know from the first guess that the word contains at least one more letter that we don't know yet? Actually, we only know for sure the letters we have: A and R are fixed, and from the first guess, we knew R and A are present. Now with the second guess, we have them fixed.

Additionally, we know the absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S are not in the word.

Now, we have two positions to fill: first and fourth, and fifth.

We need to think about the remaining letters that can be used. The word must be a 5-letter word without C, N, E, P, T, S.

We also remember from the first guess that the word has R and A (now fixed at positions 2 and 3) and possibly other letters.

We have three unknown positions: 1, 4, 5.

We must choose a guess that is a valid 5-letter word, has A in position 2 and R in position 3? But we don't have to fix them? Actually, we know they are correct, so any future guess must include A at position 2 and R at position 3 because we know they are correct. Therefore, our guess should have the form: ? A R ? ?

But note: we are allowed to use letters that we have not ruled out. The absent letters are: C, N, E, P, T, S. So the available letters are the rest of the alphabet.

Common letters that are available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many common letters as possible in the unknown positions.

We have three positions to test: position 1, 4, and 5.

We can try a word like: _ A R _ _

We need to pick letters for positions 1, 4, 5 from the available set.

Given that we only have 4 tries left, we should aim for a word that tests common letters.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern _ A R _ _

Some examples:
- BARNY: but N and Y? N is out (from guess1), so invalid because N is excluded.
- HAREM: H, A, R, E, M → E is excluded? Guess1 said E is not in the word. So E is out. Invalid.
- CAROL: C is excluded. Invalid.
- DARKY: D, A, R, K, Y → no excluded letters? Let's check: D, A, R, K, Y. Available letters? Yes. But is ""DARKY"" a word? Not standard. Maybe not valid.
- FARMY: F, A, R, M, Y → again, not sure if ""FARMY"" is a word.
- Valid words: 
  - ""HARDY"": H, A, R, D, Y → H, D, Y are available. But we have positions: position 1: H, position 4: D, position 5: Y. So the word is H A R D Y.
  - ""LARDY"": L, A, R, D, Y → LARDY is an adjective meaning like lard.
  - ""MARLY"": M, A, R, L, Y → MARLY? Not common.

Better choices:
- ""HARDY"" (meaning strong or durable) is valid.
- ""MARRY"": M, A, R, R, Y → but this has two R's. We don't know if the word can have duplicate R? We know R is at position 3. But R could appear again? Let me see the feedback rules: each letter is marked individually. If there is another R, it would be considered. But we have no information yet about duplicate letters.

In our feedback for ""crane"", we only had one R and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""parts"", we had one R and it was correct. So if the secret word has only one R, that's fine. But if it has two, then we haven't tested for that.

But testing a duplicate in a guess is risky because if it's not present, we rule out that letter unnecessarily for other positions? Actually, if we test a letter again and it is not in the word, we get an 'x'. If it is present and in the correct position, we get a check. If present but wrong position, a dash.

But in our case, for R: we already have one R correctly placed at position 3. So if we put another R in, say, position 1, then:
- If the secret word has only one R, the extra R would be marked as 'x' (absent for that position) meaning the actual R is already accounted for at position 3.
- If the secret word has two R's, then it could be marked as dash if in the word but wrong position (if position 1 is not correct for a second R) or check if it is correct.

But to avoid complexity, perhaps we should avoid duplicates for now and choose a word with unique letters.

So ""HARDY"": H A R D Y → letters are H, A, R, D, Y. A and R are known, so we are testing H, D, and Y.

Similarly, ""BARDY"": B, A, R, D, Y → BARDY might not be as common.

Other possibilities:
- ""JARDY"": not a word.
- ""WARDS"": but S is excluded. Invalid.
- ""CARDS"": C excluded. Invalid.
- ""HARLOT"": H A R L O T → too many letters? Should be 5-letter.

So limited options.

But we can consider words with O, L, etc.

Another one: ""HAREM"" has E which is excluded.

""FARMY"" is not standard.

""BARMY"": B, A, R, M, Y → BARMY (meaning crazy in British English). Valid? Yes.

Similarly, ""HARDY"" and ""BARMY"" are both options.

Also: ""LARVA"": L, A, R, V, A → has A again? Position 4: V, Position 5: A. But A is already known. Now, we are putting A again. So the letters: L, A, R, V, A.

This duplicates A. We don't know if the word has multiple A's? In position 5: if we put A, and if the secret word has a second A, it might be present.

But again, we want to test new letters.

Perhaps it's better to avoid duplicates if we can.

So let me list some words that fit _ A R _ _ without duplicate A and without the excluded letters:

- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y)
- BARMY (B, A, R, M, Y)
- LARKY (L, A, R, K, Y) → meaning? Prone to larks? Might not be common.
- FARDY (F, A, R, D, Y) → obsolete word?
- GARTH (G, A, R, T, H) → T is excluded? In ""parts"", T was marked absent, so T is not in the word. Therefore, GARTH has T — invalid.

We have to avoid T because it was ruled out by the second guess.

Similarly, S is excluded.

Another word: ""WARLY"" (W, A, R, L, Y) → WARLY means wary? Not standard; wary is 4 letters.

""JARUL"" — not a word.

Perhaps ""AARGH"" — but starts with AA, not the form. And G and H. Positions: A in position 2? But the first letter would be A? No, we need _ A R ... so the first letter is not fixed to A.

Another idea: ""OARED"" — O, A, R, E, D → E is excluded. Invalid.

Without E:

- ""HARDY"" (as above)
- ""BARMY""
- ""MADLY"" — M, A, D, L, Y → but no R? We must have R at position 3? In ""MADLY"", it's M(1), A(2), D(3), L(4), Y(5) — so position 3 is D, not R. But we need position 3 to be R? So the word must have R at position 3. Therefore, the pattern is _ A R _ _.

So ""MADLY"" doesn't fit because the third letter is D, not R.

We must have the second letter A and third letter R.

So words: [letter1] A R [letter4] [letter5]

Available letters: except C,N,E,P,T,S.

Common letters left: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Now, let me find valid words:

- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y) → valid word meaning resilient.
- BARMY (B, A, R, M, Y) → valid, informal British English.
- FARDY: not common, maybe not in dictionary.
- LARDY (L, A, R, D, Y) → valid, meaning resembling lard or overweight.
- WARBY? Not a word.
- JARED: J, A, R, E, D → E excluded? Invalid.
- HARKS: H, A, R, K, S → S excluded? Invalid.
- DARK: too short.
- PARK: too short.

Better: 
- ""DARKY"" — D, A, R, K, Y → offensive term, shouldn't use. Or not valid in word games?
- ""MARRY"" — M, A, R, R, Y → has duplicate R. But we can consider: if we guess ""MARRY"", it would be M(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). Since we know position 3 is R and correct, the fourth R would be an extra. If the word has a second R at position 4, we'll get a dash or check? But we don't know if it has two R's.

However, we want to test new letters, so duplicate R might not be efficient.

Another word: ""VARIA"" — V, A, R, I, A → form? But pattern: it is V A R I A → so positions: V(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), A(5). Here, we have duplicate A. And we test V and I.

""VARIA"" is a valid word (plural of varium? or in biology). But rare.

Better to go with ""HARDY"" or ""BARMY"" or ""LARDY"".

I think ""HARDY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters: H, D, Y.

We test H at position 1, D at position 4, Y at position 5.

If they are absent, we know. If present, we get feedback.

So I'll go with ""HARDY"".

But note: we might solve faster if we get lucky.

We have _ A R _ _

Possible solutions: Based on what we know, words like ""hardy"", ""barmy"", ""lardy"", ""fairy"" but ""fairy"" has F, A, I, R, Y? Wait, ""fairy"" is F A I R Y, so third letter is I, not R. Doesn't fit.

Another: ""marry"" as above, but with duplicate R.

Or ""carry"" but C excluded.

Or ""harry"" — H, A, R, R, Y → duplicate R.

""parry"" — P excluded.

""quarry"" — too long.

So five-letter: ""hardy"", ""barmy"", ""lardy"", ""tardy"" but T excluded? ""tardy"" has T? T(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) — T is excluded by guess2? Guess2: ""parts"" had T at position4 and marked as absent. So T is not in the word. Therefore, ""tardy"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""party"" has T.

So ""hardy"" is a good representative.

Therefore, let's guess ""HARDY"".Based on the cumulative feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"") feedback**: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  This indicates that:  
  - C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.  
  - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked ""-"" in positions 2 and 3, respectively).

- **Guess 2 (""parts"") feedback**: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x)  
  This indicates that:  
  - P, T, and S are **not** in the secret word.  
  - A is **correctly placed at position 2**.  
  - R is **correctly placed at position 3**.  

### Deduced information about the secret word:
The secret word must:  
- Be 5 letters long.  
- Have the pattern `_ A R _ _` (since A is fixed at position 2 and R at position 3).  
- Exclude the letters **C, E, N, P, T, S** (all marked absent in previous guesses).  
- Include only letters from the remaining pool: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  

### Strategy for the next guess:
- The goal is to test new common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 to narrow down possibilities.  
- We should avoid duplicating letters unnecessarily (though duplicates are possible if evidence suggests them), as there may be additional unknown letters.  
- Common letters not yet tested include **L, M, D, Y, H, O, U, B**—prioritizing these can maximize information gain.  
- Valid words fitting the `_ A R _ _` pattern without excluded letters include ""HARDY"" (tests H, D, Y), ""BARMY"" (tests B, M, Y), or ""LARDY"" (tests L, D, Y). ""HARDY"" is chosen because it uses high-frequency letters (H, D, Y) and is a common word.  

This guess will confirm or rule out H, D, and Y in their respective positions, bringing us closer to the solution.

<guess>hardy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)
Guess 3: hardy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  Interpretation: 
    - C, N, E are not in the word.
    - R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 (as per their positions in ""crane"").

Guess 2: parts -> Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x)
  Interpretation:
    - P, T, S are not in the word.
    - A is correctly placed at position 2.
    - R is correctly placed at position 3.

Therefore, the secret word has A at position 2 and R at position 3, and the pattern is _ A R _ _

Guess 3: hardy -> Feedback: H(x), A(✓), R(✓), D(x), Y(✓)
  Interpretation:
    - H and D are not in the word.
    - A is still correct at position 2 (as expected).
    - R is still correct at position 3 (as expected).
    - Y is correctly placed at position 5? Let's check the positions of ""hardy"":
        Position 1: H, which is marked x (not present)
        Position 2: A, marked ✓ (correct)
        Position 3: R, marked ✓ (correct)
        Position 4: D, marked x (not present)
        Position 5: Y, marked ✓ (correct)

So the feedback shows Y is correct at position 5.

Therefore, we now know that the secret word ends with Y at position 5. The word pattern is _ A R _ Y.

Additionally, we have accumulated absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S, H, D.

So the known pattern is: [letter1] A R [letter4] Y

And excluded letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D.

We need to find a valid 5-letter English word that matches this pattern and does not contain any excluded letters.

Possible letters for position 1 and position 4 must come from the remaining letters: 
B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We also note that from Guess 1, we had R marked with ""-"" meaning R was present but not in position 2 (which we now know because it's fixed at position 3). Similarly, A was present but not in position 3 (and we now know it's at position 2). There are no other known constraints.

Now, let's think of words that fit _ A R _ Y.

Examples: 
- ""Fairy"" -> F, A, I, R, Y? But our pattern requires the third letter to be R, and ""fairy"" is F-A-I-R-Y, so third letter is I, not R. Doesn't fit.
- ""Harry"" -> excluded because H is absent? Also, H is excluded.
- ""Marry"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we have two R's. Pattern: M(1), A(2), R(3) -> correct, then R(4), Y(5). But Y is correct at position 5. Is ""marry"" allowed? But note that the fourth letter would be R. However, we have excluded many letters but R is already in the word (at position 3). We don't know if the word has a second R.

But we have to consider that if we fill position 4 with R, then the word becomes _ A R R Y. But that might be a valid word?

Words that fit:
- ""Marry"": M A R R Y -> first letter M, fourth letter R.
- ""Barry"": B A R R Y -> same pattern.
- ""Carry"": excluded because C is absent.
- ""Jarry"": J A R R Y? Is ""jarry"" a word? Not commonly recognized.
- ""Parry"": excluded because P is absent.

Other possibilities without duplicate R:
- ""Warty"": but W A R T Y -> T is excluded? Yes, T is absent. Invalid.
- ""Narky"": N is excluded? In guess1, N is absent. Invalid.
- ""Sparky"": S and P are excluded, and pattern would be S P A R K Y? Not matching _ A R _ Y because first two letters would be S P? Actually, no: for the pattern, we need first letter, then A at 2, R at 3. ""Sparky"" has S at 1, P at 2, A at 3? Doesn't match.

Let me list words matching _ A R _ Y that exist in English and are 5 letters.

Common words:
- ""Marry"": M A R R Y
- ""Barry"": B A R R Y (as a name, but it's accepted as a word)
- ""Harry"": H excluded? H is absent. Invalid.
- ""Tarry"": T excluded? Invalid.
- ""Lardy"": L A R D Y -> but D is absent? In ""hardy"", D was marked absent? Yes, D is excluded. So invalid.
- ""Fairy"": doesn't match because it's F-A-I-R-Y -> third letter is I, not R.

Without duplicate R:
- ""Carboy"": but C excluded? Also, pattern C A R ... -> third letter R, then B O Y? This would be 6 letters? No, carboy is 6 letters? Actually, C-A-R-B-O-Y is 6 letters.

Another: ""Barmy"": B A R M Y -> pattern fits: position 1: B, 2: A, 3: R, 4: M, 5: Y. And letters: B, A, R, M, Y.

Now, check against excluded letters: B, M, Y are not excluded? Excluded letters: C,E,N,P,T,S,H,D. So B, M, Y are allowed.

Similarly, ""barmy"" is a valid word (adjective, meaning foolish).

Also, ""marry"" is M,A,R,R,Y. We must check if the fourth letter R is allowed? We have R already at position 3. The secret word might have two R's. But if we guess a word with two R's, it's acceptable unless we have constraints against it.

But we have two candidates: ""marry"" and ""barmy"".

Are there others?
- ""Gawky"": G A W K Y -> but third letter W? Not R. Doesn't fit.
- ""Jazzy"": J A Z Z Y -> third letter Z? Not R.
- ""Mangy"": M A N G Y -> N excluded? Invalid.

So possible words: ""marry"" and ""barmy"".

We have already guessed ""barmy"" or something similar? We have not guessed ""barmy"" yet.

In guess3 we guessed ""hardy"". We haven't guessed ""barmy"".

But note: in ""barmy"", the pattern is B A R M Y. Position 4 is M.

In the secret word, we don't know if it has M.

Similarly, in ""marry"", position 4 is R.

How can we decide? We have 3 tries left (since this will be guess4).

We can choose to guess ""barmy"" because it tests M at position 4.

Alternatively, ""marry"" tests an extra R at position 4.

But we can also think: we know Y is at the end. And we need to solve the word.

We can choose a word that tests a different letter at position 1 and at position 4.

But note: we don't know what letter is at position 4 and position 1.

Since we have two possibilities (or more), we can try one that covers a letter we haven't tested.

In ""barmy"" we use B and M, both of which are new and not tested before.

Similarly, ""marry"" uses M at position 1? ""marry"" uses M and R (again). But we already know R is present at position 3; if we use R at position 4, we won't test a new letter at position 4.

Therefore, guessing ""barmy"" seems better because it tests two new letters: B and M.

If ""barmy"" turns out to be the word, we win. If not, the feedback will tell us about B and M.

So let's choose ""barmy"".

Also, note: we might have other words? Like ""warmly"" but that's 6 letters.

Or ""fury"" too short.

Another word: ""fairy"" does not fit because it requires R at position 4? But pattern is _ A R _ Y, so position 3 is R, position 4 must be filled.

""Airy"" is 4 letters.

So I think ""barmy"" is a strong candidate.

But let me confirm: is ""barmy"" a valid word? Yes, it is.

Therefore, we guess ""barmy"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are present but misplaced, while C, N, and E are absent. This shows R and A are in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3.
- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: A is correct at position 2, R is correct at position 3, while P, T, and S are absent. This confirms the secret word pattern is `_ A R _ _`.
- **Guess 3 (""hardy"")**: A and R remain correct at positions 2 and 3, Y is correct at position 5, while H and D are absent. This updates the secret word pattern to `_ A R _ Y` and rules out H and D.

### Deduced knowledge:
- **Fixed positions**: Position 2 = A, Position 3 = R, Position 5 = Y → Pattern: `[letter1] A R [letter4] Y`.
- **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D (8 letters total).
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
- **Unknowns**: Letters for positions 1 and 4 must be from the remaining pool.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., M, L, B, O, U) to maximize information gain.
- Use a valid English word that fits the pattern `_ A R _ Y` and avoids absent letters.
- Candidates include ""barmy"" (tests B, M, Y) or ""marry"" (tests M, duplicate R), but ""barmy"" is preferred to test new letters B and M in positions 1 and 4 simultaneously.
- If ""barmy"" is correct, we solve it; otherwise, feedback on B and M will reduce possibilities significantly.

<guess>barmy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)
Guess 3: hardy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)
Guess 4: barmy -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(✓) M(-) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from the fourth guess ""barmy"":
  B: absent (x)
  A: correct position (✓) at position 2
  R: correct position (✓) at position 3
  M: present but wrong position (-) at position 4? Let's see the positions.

In ""barmy"":
  Position 1: B → marked as absent (x)
  Position 2: A → correct (✓)
  Position 3: R → correct (✓)
  Position 4: M → present but wrong position (-)
  Position 5: Y → correct (✓)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word pattern remains: _ A R _ Y
- The letter M is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- Additionally, B is absent (added to the excluded list).

Now we update our knowledge:

Fixed positions:
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: R
  Position 5: Y

Letters present that are not correctly placed:
  M is present but not in position 4. So M must be in the secret word but not at position 4.

Absent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B (from previous guesses)

Remaining available letters: F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

But we know M is present (just not in position 4), so M must be in the word. Therefore, M is in the word, but its correct position is not 4. Since we only have positions 1 and 4 left to find, M must be in position 1? Why? Because position 4 is the only other position besides position 1 that we don't know. And we know M is not in position 4 (as per feedback) so M must be in position 1? Not necessarily. We know M is not in position 4, and since position 2,3,5 are fixed, the only other position where M could be is position 1.

Therefore:
- Position 1 must be M? Because M is present and it cannot be in position 4? Actually, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Positions 2,3,5 are known and fixed: A, R, Y. So if M is in the word and not at position 4, then it must be at position 1? Because there are no other positions left? Wait, position 1 is the only unknown position left? No, we have two unknown positions: position 1 and position 4. But position 4 is not M? According to the feedback, M is in the word but not in position 4. It could be that position 1 is M? Or is there another possibility? But if M is in the word and not in position 4, and we only have position 1 and position 4 as variable, then position 1 must be M. Yes.

Therefore, the secret word must have M at position 1? Then what is at position 4? Position 4 must be a letter that is not M and not excluded? And since M is at position 1, then the word is M A R ? Y.

But then the feedback for ""barmy"": we guessed B at position 1 and got absent? Now we know that position 1 should be M, not B? And we have M at position 4? But we also got M marked as present but wrong position. So if M were at position 1? Then in the secret word, M is at position 1? But in our guess ""barmy"", we put M at position 4? And the feedback said M is present but not in position 4, meaning its correct position is elsewhere? It could be position 1? Then yes.

Therefore, we can conclude that the letter at position 1 is M? And the secret word is M A R ? Y.

But then the letter at position 4 is still unknown? And it must be a letter from the available set? But we know M is already at position 1, so position 4 must be another letter.

Moreover, we must not use excluded letters? And we haven't tested many letters? But wait? Do we know if there are duplicate M's? We have no evidence? But given the feedback? The feedback for ""barmy"": we got B absent (for position 1), then A and R correct, M present but not in position 4? Then Y correct. So after getting the M at position 4 flagged as wrong position, and since position 1 is the only other unknown position? But actually, position 1 is also variable? So why can't position 1 be something else and M be only at position 4? But the feedback says M is not at position 4? So if we place M at position 1 in the secret word, then in the guess ""barmy"", we had M at position 4? Then it would be marked as absent if M is only at position 1? Or as present? Wait: in the secret word, if M is only at position 1? Then when we put M at position 4? We get a dash? Because M is in the word but not in position 4? That matches? So if the secret word has M at position 1, then it's consistent with the feedback? If the secret word has M at position 4? Then we would have gotten a check? But we didn't? We got a dash? Meaning it's present but not at position 4? So it cannot be at position 4? Therefore, if M is at position 1? Then yes? But also? It could be at position 1? Given the unknown positions? So it must be at position 1? Therefore:

The secret word is M A R ? Y.

What can be the fourth letter? Position 4: must be a letter from the available set? Which is: F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? Without M? Because we already have M at position 1? And no duplicates? Unless? The secret word might have duplicate M? But we don't know? But let's assume no? Or wait: the feedback doesn't rule out duplicates? But we have no duplicate M? Because if there were a duplicate M? Then we didn't get any feedback that? We don't know? Actually, if we put M at position 4? And the secret word has M only at position 1? Then feedback would mark position 4 M as dash? Because it's in the word? But if it also had M at position 4? Then it would be marked as check? But we got a dash? Meaning M is in the word elsewhere? Not at position 4? So it doesn't necessarily imply that there is only one M? But if there were a duplicate? Then position 4 M might be marked as dash? Meaning the secret word has an M? But not at position 4? Then we don't know how many M's? Actually, it doesn't matter? Because we already know from this that there is an M at position 1? Because we have no other positions? Wait: if we assume the secret word has an M? And it's not at position 4? And positions 2,3,5 are fixed? Then it must be at position 1? So only one M? So there shouldn't be a duplicate? Therefore, position 1 is M? And position 4 is another letter? And that letter is not M? Because duplicate? Not necessary? But we don't know? However, we don't need to guess that? Because we can now guess a word starting with M? And A R at positions 2 and 3? Then some letter at position 4? And Y at position 5? So M A R ? Y.

Now, we need to choose the letter at position 4? But we have many choices? So we should try to test several possibilities? But how? We have one guess? That can only put one letter at position 4? So we need to narrow down? But we have 2 guesses left? Since this is guess 4? Then next is guess 5? Then guess 6? We have two attempts? We can try to find a common letter? Or we can try to test multiple letters? But it's hard?

Alternatively, we can think of valid English words matching M A R ? Y.

Possible words:
- ""Marly"" -> M A R L Y? Meaning? Like the place? But valid word.
- ""Marvy"" -> M A R V Y? Informal for excellent? Valid? Maybe not very common? But acceptable.
- ""Mary"" is 4 letters? Not.
- ""Mardy"" -> M A R D Y? But D is excluded. Invalid.
- ""Waray"" -> W A R A Y? Not matching? We need M at position 1? Pattern is M A R ? Y? So first letter M? Then A, R, then fourth letter, then Y.

Also? ""Marry"" is M A R R Y? But that has R at position 4? And we already have R? Is duplicate R allowed? But we haven't tested that? However, note that we know R is at position 3? So if we put R at position 4? It might be a duplicate? But in the feedback for guess 2? When we guessed ""parts""? We had R at position 3? And we got a check? Then for guess 3? ""hardy""? We had R at position 3? Check? So no duplicate? Or we don't know? Actually, we don't have any guess that tested R at position 4? So it could be that the secret word has a duplicate R? Or not?

In ""marry"": M, A, R, R, Y? So we have R at positions 3 and 4? Then position 3 R is fixed? Which we know is correct? Position 4 R would be part of the word? But in the feedback for ""barmy""? We had M at position 4? Which is dash? Meaning M is present but not at position 4? But we deduced that M must be at position 1? So if we put duplicate? But in ""marry""? There is no other M? Wait? ""marry"" does not have M? It has M at position 1? Then R at 3 and 4? Then Y at 5? So letters: M, A, R, R, Y.

But we have already concluded that position 1 must be M? Then position 4 is R? That is a duplicate R? This is possible? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Wordle does allow duplicates? So it's possible? But what about M? The M is at position 1? So if the secret word is ""marry""? Then position 1 M? Position 2 A? Position 3 R? Position 4 R? Position 5 Y? Then in the guess ""barmy"": 
  Position 1: B -> absent? Correct? Because secret has M? Not B.
  Position 2: A -> match.
  Position 3: R -> match.
  Position 4: M -> we guessed M? But secret has R? So M is not at position 4? Which is true? But is M in the word? Yes? At position 1? So M is present? But not at position 4? Therefore, we got a dash? Correct? And Y match? So yes? ""marry"" fits.

Similarly, we could have ""marly"": M A R L Y? Then position 4 is L? Which is an available letter.

Also, ""marked"" has 6 letters? Not.

And ""marvy"" as I thought? Is it ""marvy""? Informal? Meaning marvelous? Yes.

Other possibilities? ""maray""? Not a word? ""makay""? Not.

So the contenders are:
- ""marry"" (M A R R Y) → duplicate R? And we haven't ruled it out?
- ""marly"" (M A R L Y)
- ""marvy"" (M A R V Y)

But we must not use excluded letters? We don't have L, V? Etc? Excluded? No? They are in the available list? Because excluded letters: C,E,N,P,T,S,H,D,B? So L, V are allowed.

So three candidates? We need to choose one? And we have two guesses left? We might need more information?

But if we guess ""marly""? For example? Then:
- If it's the secret word? Success.
- If not? The feedback might tell us about L? And also we test M at position 1? Which we think is true? But actually? We deduced M at position 1? So let's check another possibility? What if the secret word has M at position 4? But we got a dash for M at position 4 meaning not there? So it can't be at position 4? So it must be at position 1? Almost? But what about if the secret word has M at some other position? But the only other position? Position 1? So yes.

Therefore, we must have M at position 1? So the word is M A R ? Y.

But then there are only 12 letters that ? at position 4 can be? So we need to guess.

Now, to maximize information? We can try a word that tests the least common? But we may want to try one of the words that is common.

Alternatively, we can list the possible words? We have 3: ""marry"", ""marly"", ""marvy""? But are there more?

- ""marey""? Not a word?
- ""mazey""? Meaning confusing? And Z is allowed? But pattern M A Z E Y? But third letter is Z? Not R! Must be R at position 3? So no.
- ""mary"": too short.
- ""murry"": meaning? Like? Not standard? M U R R Y? But first letter M? Then U? Then R? But position 2? Must be A? So A missing? No? Pattern is M A R ? Y? Position 2 must be A? So M A R then fourth letter? Then Y? So it must be ... ARY? Like? ""marsh"" is S excluded? And 5 letters? M A R S H? Excluded? And pattern? Position 5 H? But we need Y? So invalid.

Another: ""maply""? Not a word.

So common ones: ""marry"", ""marly"", ""marvy"".

We can also include ""jarry""? Or ""warly""? But less common.

Since ""marry"" has duplicate R? Let's see why it might be acceptable.

But let's consider that we haven't tested any letters at position 4? So we don't know what it is? So we must guess? And we have two attempts? We can start with one? For example? Guess ""marly""? To test if L is at position 4? If it works? Good? Else? We know L is not at position 4? Then we can try another? Like ""marvy"" next? Etc? But we have only two guesses.

Alternatively? We can choose a word that uses a common letter? But we don't know.

But note: we have feedback that told us M MUST be in position 1? So let's think of ""marry""? But if we guess ""marry""? Then:
- We put M at position 1: it should be ✓? And A and R at positions 2 and 3: ✓? Then R at position 4: if the secret word has R at position 4? Then ✓? But if not? Then it might be marked as dash? Or? But we know R is not at position 4? Because R is fixed at position 3? And we don't know if there is a duplicate? So if we put R at position 4? It could be:
  - If the secret word has only one R? Then R at position 4 would be marked as absent? But we know R is in the word at position 3? So we get an x? Meaning that letter at position 4 is not in the word? Or if it is a different letter? It would be dash if present?

This is confusing. Better to avoid duplicates in our guess? Because we already know M at position 1? So we can test a single letter at position 4? So we choose a word that has M at position 1? And a letter we haven't tested? So that if that letter is correct? We win? Else? We know it's another letter.

So let's choose ""marly"" to test L at position 4? Because L is common? Also? ""marvy"" has V which is less common? ""marry"" tests R at position 4? But we already know R? So it might not test a new letter? And might cause duplication issues.

Therefore, I'll go with ""marly"".Based on the cumulative feedback and deductions:

- **Pattern**: The secret word must be of the form `? A R ? Y`.
- **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B (9 letters total).
- **Present letters**:
  - M is in the secret word but not in position 4 (as per Guess 4: ""barmy"" had M marked ""-"" at position 4).
  - Since positions 2 (A), 3 (R), and 5 (Y) are fixed, and M is present but not at position 4, **M must be at position 1**. Thus, the secret word pattern is `M A R ? Y`.
- **Remaining unknown**: Only position 4 is unknown. Its letter must be from the unfiltered pool (F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) and not absent from prior guesses.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Test a valid English word fitting `M A R ? Y`, prioritizing common letters like **L** (in ""marly"") or **V** (in ""marvy""). 
- ""Marly"" (M A R L Y) is chosen because:
  - ""L"" is a high-frequency letter not yet tested.
  - It tests position 4 specifically with L.
  - If correct, game ends; if incorrect, feedback on L will reduce possibilities for the final guess.

Given the constraints, ""marly"" is a safe guess to optimize the remaining attempts.

<guess>marly</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3; C, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: A is correct at position 2, R is correct at position 3; P, T, S are absent. The pattern is `_ A R _ _`.
- **Guess 3 (""hardy"")**: A and R remain correct; Y is correct at position 5; H and D are absent. The pattern updates to `_ A R _ Y`.
- **Guess 4 (""barmy"")**: A, R, and Y are correct; B is absent; M is present but not in position 4. The presence of M and pattern constraints (fixed A, R, Y) force M to **position 1**, as it cannot be in position 4.

### Deduced knowledge:
- **Fixed pattern**: `M A R ? Y`  
- **Position 4 must be a letter not excluded**: Absent letters are C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B.  
- **Possible candidates** for position 4 include common letters like L, V, O, or U (from remaining pool: F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).  
- Valid words fitting the pattern include ""marly"" (tests L), ""marvy"" (tests V), or ""mary"" (invalid length; ""marry"" duplicates R).  

### Strategy for this guess:
- Test ""marly"" (M A R L Y) to check L at position 4—a high-frequency letter.  
- If incorrect, feedback on L (present/absent) will isolate position 4 options for the final guess.

Common letters in English include: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\nA good strategy is to try a word that has R and A in new positions and also tests other common letters.\n\nLet me brainstorm some words that meet the criteria:\n- Must include R and A (and not C, N, E).\n- Let\'s try to put R in position 1 and A in position 4, for example.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""RADAR"": But this has two R\'s and two A\'s. Also, we know only one R and one A? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. The secret word might have duplicate letters? But in the example, the word ""BRISK"" has no duplicates. However, we cannot rule out duplicates. But to be safe, let\'s avoid assuming duplicates until we have evidence.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed only one R and one A as present (and in wrong positions). If there were duplicates, we might have seen more? Actually, the feedback only marks each letter that is present. For example, if the word had two R\'s and one of them was in the correct position, it would show a check for that one and a dash for the other if it\'s present but in the wrong place. But in our case, we only have one R and one A in the guess, and they are both present but in wrong positions. So the secret word has at least one R and one A. It might have more, but we don\'t know.\n\nTo keep it simple, let\'s try to use a word with unique letters for now.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that has R and A and also includes other common letters like S, T, L, O.\n\nLet me try to form such a word.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""ROAST"": But we have E excluded, and ROAST has O, A, S, T, and R. But wait, we have R in position 1 and A in position 3? But in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a dash meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, that would be the same position? We should avoid that. Also, we have R in position 1, which is a new position.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess says A is not in position 3, so if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\nTherefore, in the second guess, we should put A in a position that is not 3 (so 1,2,4,5) and R in a position that is not 2 (so 1,3,4,5).\n\nLet me try to list words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.\n\nSome options:\n- ""PARTY"": P, A, R, T, Y -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is valid because A was not in position 2 in the first guess? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3, so position 2 is new for A. Similarly, R was in position 2 in the first guess, now we put it in position 3, which is new. Also, we test P, T, Y.\n\n- ""TRAIL"": T, R, A, I, L -> R in position 2? But wait, in the first guess R was in position 2 and we got a dash meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting R in position 2. Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 3.\n\nIn ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 and A is in position 3. That\'s exactly the positions we must avoid. So that\'s not good.\n\n- ""BRAVO"": B, R, A, V, O -> R in position 2?

That\'s okay because A wasn\'t in position 2 before. But wait, we have A in position 2 and R in position 1. However, we are testing A in a new position (2) and R in a new position (1). But note: the word ""RAPID"" has A in position 2 and R in position 1. Also, we test P, I, D.\n\nBut we must avoid C, N, E. ""RAPID"" doesn\'t have those.\n\nAnother option: ""ROARS"" -> but this has two R\'s? And A is in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.\n\nAnother: ""SAVOR"": S, A, V, O, R -> A in position 2, R in position 5. This is good because A is not in position 3 and R is not in position 2. Also, we test S, V, O.\n\nBut we don\'t know if S, V, O are in the word. This is a good candidate.\n\nAnother: ""TAROT"": T, A, R, O, T -> has two T\'s. A in position 2, R in position 3. This is okay for A (position 2 is new) and R (position 3 is new). But we have duplicate T.\n\nI think ""SAVOR"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places R and A in new positions.\n\nBut let me check if ""SAVOR"" is a valid word. Yes, it means to enjoy something.\n\nAnother common word: ""STARK"": S, T, A, R, K -> A in position 3? We must avoid A in position 3. So not good.\n\n""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S -> A in position 2, R in position 3. This is acceptable because A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (new). Also, we test P, T, S.\n\n""PARTS"" is a valid word.\n\nNow, comparing ""SAVOR"" and ""PARTS"":\n- Both have A in position 2 and R in position 3? Wait, in ""SAVOR"": \n  S (1), A (2), V (3), O (4), R (5) -> so R is in position 5, not 3.\n\nIn ""SAVOR"", R is at the end. That\'s better because we haven\'t tested R in position 5 yet.\n\nIn ""PARTS"": \n  P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), S (5) -> R is in position 3 and A in position 2.\n\nWe haven\'t tested R in position 3 or 5, and A in position 2 is new.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we know it\'s not there. Now, if we put R in position 3, that\'s a new position. Similarly, A in position 2 is new.\n\nHowever, we might get more information from ""SAVOR"" because it tests more positions for R and A.\n\nBut let me think about the letters: \n- ""SAVOR"" tests S, A, V, O, R. \n- ""PARTS"" tests P, A, R, T, S.\n\nBoth are good. But we also want to test common letters. S and T are very common, so ""PARTS"" tests S and T, which are common. ""SAVOR"" tests V and O, which are less common.\n\nSo ""PARTS"" might be better because it tests more common letters.\n\nBut we already know that the word has R and A, so we are guaranteed to get some feedback on them. The other letters are the ones we are testing for presence.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to use a word that has R and A and also includes letters that are common and we haven\'t tested. We haven\'t tested S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\nIn ""PARTS"", we test P, A, R, T, S. We avoid C, N, E.\n\nIn ""SAVOR"", we test S, A, V, O, R.\n\nI think ""PARTS"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test more.\n\nAnother word: ""RATIO"" -> R, A, T, I, O. But R is in position 1, A in position 2. This is good: R not in 2, A not in 3. And we test T, I, O.\n\nBut we have to avoid E, which we do.\n\n""RATIO"" is a common word.\n\nBut let me compare:\n- ""RATIO"": R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5)\n- ""PARTS"": P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)\n\nBoth are valid. But in ""RATIO"", we are testing I and O, which are vowels, and we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). But we don\'t know if it has more.\n\nI think ""PARTS"" is better because it tests S and T, which are more common than I and O? Actually, T is very common.\n\nBut let me look at letter frequencies. In English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we know E is out, and C and N are out. So remaining: A, R, I, O, T, S, L.\n\nWe have already tested A and R (and know they are in the word). We haven\'t tested I, O, T, S, L.\n\nSo testing T and S (as in ""PARTS"") is good because they are high frequency.\n\nAlternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R and A positions.\n\nWhat about ""STAIR"": S, T, A, I, R -> A in position 3? Not allowed.\n\n""ALERT"": but E is excluded.\n\n""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> R in position 2? Not allowed.\n\n""CRATE"": but C is excluded.\n\n""PLANT"": but N is excluded.\n\nSo back to ""PARTS"" and ""RATIO"".\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""PARTS"" because it tests S and T, which are very common, and it places R in a new position (3) and A in a new position (2).\n\nSo my second guess: PARTS\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PARTS"" is a valid English word.\n\nTherefore, the guess is ""parts"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: -, N: x, E: x), we know:\n- The secret word contains R and A, but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked as present but wrong position).\n- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n- R must be in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5) and A must be in a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""parts"" because:\n- It includes R (now in position 3) and A (now in position 2), both in new positions to test their correct placement.\n- It avoids the excluded letters (C, N, E).\n- It introduces new common letters (P, T, S) to gather more information about their presence/absence and positions.\n- ""Parts"" is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>parts</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n1. Crane: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x) → so R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.\n2. Parts: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x) → now A is correct in position 2, and R is correct in position 3? Wait, let\'s see the positions.\n\nRecall the positions in ""parts"":\n  P(1), A(2), R(3), T(4), S(5)\n\nFeedback: \n  P(x) → P not in word.\n  A(✓) → A is correct at position 2. So the secret word has A in the second position.\n  R(✓) → R is correct at position 3. So the secret word has R in the third position.\n  T(x) → T not in word.\n  S(x) → S not in word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has A as the second letter and R as the third letter. So the word is: _ A R _ _\n- We also know from the first guess that the word contains at least one more letter that we don\'t know yet? Actually, we only know for sure the letters we have: A and R are fixed, and from the first guess, we knew R and A are present. Now with the second guess, we have them fixed.\n\nAdditionally, we know the absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S are not in the word.\n\nNow, we have two positions to fill: first and fourth, and fifth.\n\nWe need to think about the remaining letters that can be used. The word must be a 5-letter word without C, N, E, P, T, S.\n\nWe also remember from the first guess that the word has R and A (now fixed at positions 2 and 3) and possibly other letters.\n\nWe have three unknown positions: 1, 4, 5.\n\nWe must choose a guess that is a valid 5-letter word, has A in position 2 and R in position 3? But we don\'t have to fix them? Actually, we know they are correct, so any future guess must include A at position 2 and R at position 3 because we know they are correct. Therefore, our guess should have the form: ? A R ? ?\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use letters that we have not ruled out. The absent letters are: C, N, E, P, T, S. So the available letters are the rest of the alphabet.\n\nCommon letters that are available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to test as many common letters as possible in the unknown positions.\n\nWe have three positions to test: position 1, 4, and 5.\n\nWe can try a word like: _ A R _ _\n\nWe need to pick letters for positions 1, 4, 5 from the available set.\n\nGiven that we only have 4 tries left, we should aim for a word that tests common letters.\n\nLet me think of words that fit the pattern _ A R _ _\n\nSome examples:\n- BARNY: but N and Y? N is out (from guess1), so invalid because N is excluded.\n- HAREM: H, A, R, E, M → E is excluded? Guess1 said E is not in the word. So E is out. Invalid.\n- CAROL: C is excluded. Invalid.\n- DARKY: D, A, R, K, Y → no excluded letters? Let\'s check: D, A, R, K, Y. Available letters? Yes. But is ""DARKY"" a word? Not standard. Maybe not valid.\n- FARMY: F, A, R, M, Y → again, not sure if ""FARMY"" is a word.\n- Valid words: \n  - ""HARDY"": H, A, R, D, Y → H, D, Y are available. But we have positions: position 1: H, position 4: D, position 5: Y. So the word is H A R D Y.\n  - ""LARDY"": L, A, R, D, Y → LARDY is an adjective meaning like lard.\n  - ""MARLY"": M, A, R, L, Y → MARLY? Not common.\n\nBetter choices:\n- ""HARDY"" (meaning strong or durable) is valid.\n- ""MARRY"": M, A, R, R, Y → but this has two R\'s. We don\'t know if the word can have duplicate R? We know R is at position 3. But R could appear again? Let me see the feedback rules: each letter is marked individually. If there is another R, it would be considered. But we have no information yet about duplicate letters.\n\nIn our feedback for ""crane"", we only had one R and it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""parts"", we had one R and it was correct. So if the secret word has only one R, that\'s fine. But if it has two, then we haven\'t tested for that.\n\nBut testing a duplicate in a guess is risky because if it\'s not present, we rule out that letter unnecessarily for other positions? Actually, if we test a letter again and it is not in the word, we get an \'x\'. If it is present and in the correct position, we get a check. If present but wrong position, a dash.\n\nBut in our case, for R: we already have one R correctly placed at position 3. So if we put another R in, say, position 1, then:\n- If the secret word has only one R, the extra R would be marked as \'x\' (absent for that position) meaning the actual R is already accounted for at position 3.\n- If the secret word has two R\'s, then it could be marked as dash if in the word but wrong position (if position 1 is not correct for a second R) or check if it is correct.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, perhaps we should avoid duplicates for now and choose a word with unique letters.\n\nSo ""HARDY"": H A R D Y → letters are H, A, R, D, Y. A and R are known, so we are testing H, D, and Y.\n\nSimilarly, ""BARDY"": B, A, R, D, Y → BARDY might not be as common.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- ""JARDY"": not a word.\n- ""WARDS"": but S is excluded. Invalid.\n- ""CARDS"": C excluded. Invalid.\n- ""HARLOT"": H A R L O T → too many letters? Should be 5-letter.\n\nSo limited options.\n\nBut we can consider words with O, L, etc.\n\nAnother one: ""HAREM"" has E which is excluded.\n\n""FARMY"" is not standard.\n\n""BARMY"": B, A, R, M, Y → BARMY (meaning crazy in British English). Valid? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""HARDY"" and ""BARMY"" are both options.\n\nAlso: ""LARVA"": L, A, R, V, A → has A again? Position 4: V, Position 5: A. But A is already known. Now, we are putting A again. So the letters: L, A, R, V, A.\n\nThis duplicates A. We don\'t know if the word has multiple A\'s? In position 5: if we put A, and if the secret word has a second A, it might be present.\n\nBut again, we want to test new letters.\n\nPerhaps it\'s better to avoid duplicates if we can.\n\nSo let me list some words that fit _ A R _ _ without duplicate A and without the excluded letters:\n\n- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y)\n- BARMY (B, A, R, M, Y)\n- LARKY (L, A, R, K, Y) → meaning? Prone to larks? Might not be common.\n- FARDY (F, A, R, D, Y) → obsolete word?\n- GARTH (G, A, R, T, H) → T is excluded? In ""parts"", T was marked absent, so T is not in the word. Therefore, GARTH has T — invalid.\n\nWe have to avoid T because it was ruled out by the second guess.\n\nSimilarly, S is excluded.\n\nAnother word: ""WARLY"" (W, A, R, L, Y) → WARLY means wary? Not standard; wary is 4 letters.\n\n""JARUL"" — not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""AARGH"" — but starts with AA, not the form. And G and H. Positions: A in position 2? But the first letter would be A? No, we need _ A R ... so the first letter is not fixed to A.\n\nAnother idea: ""OARED"" — O, A, R, E, D → E is excluded. Invalid.\n\nWithout E:\n\n- ""HARDY"" (as above)\n- ""BARMY""\n- ""MADLY"" — M, A, D, L, Y → but no R? We must have R at position 3? In ""MADLY"", it\'s M(1), A(2), D(3), L(4), Y(5) — so position 3 is D, not R. But we need position 3 to be R? So the word must have R at position 3. Therefore, the pattern is _ A R _ _.\n\nSo ""MADLY"" doesn\'t fit because the third letter is D, not R.\n\nWe must have the second letter A and third letter R.\n\nSo words: [letter1] A R [letter4] [letter5]\n\nAvailable letters: except C,N,E,P,T,S.\n\nCommon letters left: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,O,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nNow, let me find valid words:\n\n- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y) → valid word meaning resilient.\n- BARMY (B, A, R, M, Y) → valid, informal British English.\n- FARDY: not common, maybe not in dictionary.\n- LARDY (L, A, R, D, Y) → valid, meaning resembling lard or overweight.\n- WARBY? Not a word.\n- JARED: J, A, R, E, D → E excluded? Invalid.\n- HARKS: H, A, R, K, S → S excluded? Invalid.\n- DARK: too short.\n- PARK: too short.\n\nBetter: \n- ""DARKY"" — D, A, R, K, Y → offensive term, shouldn\'t use. Or not valid in word games?\n- ""MARRY"" — M, A, R, R, Y → has duplicate R. But we can consider: if we guess ""MARRY"", it would be M(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5). Since we know position 3 is R and correct, the fourth R would be an extra. If the word has a second R at position 4, we\'ll get a dash or check? But we don\'t know if it has two R\'s.\n\nHowever, we want to test new letters, so duplicate R might not be efficient.\n\nAnother word: ""VARIA"" — V, A, R, I, A → form? But pattern: it is V A R I A → so positions: V(1), A(2), R(3), I(4), A(5). Here, we have duplicate A. And we test V and I.\n\n""VARIA"" is a valid word (plural of varium? or in biology). But rare.\n\nBetter to go with ""HARDY"" or ""BARMY"" or ""LARDY"".\n\nI think ""HARDY"" is a good choice because it uses common letters: H, D, Y.\n\nWe test H at position 1, D at position 4, Y at position 5.\n\nIf they are absent, we know. If present, we get feedback.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""HARDY"".\n\nBut note: we might solve faster if we get lucky.\n\nWe have _ A R _ _\n\nPossible solutions: Based on what we know, words like ""hardy"", ""barmy"", ""lardy"", ""fairy"" but ""fairy"" has F, A, I, R, Y? Wait, ""fairy"" is F A I R Y, so third letter is I, not R. Doesn\'t fit.\n\nAnother: ""marry"" as above, but with duplicate R.\n\nOr ""carry"" but C excluded.\n\nOr ""harry"" — H, A, R, R, Y → duplicate R.\n\n""parry"" — P excluded.\n\n""quarry"" — too long.\n\nSo five-letter: ""hardy"", ""barmy"", ""lardy"", ""tardy"" but T excluded? ""tardy"" has T? T(1), A(2), R(3), D(4), Y(5) — T is excluded by guess2? Guess2: ""parts"" had T at position4 and marked as absent. So T is not in the word. Therefore, ""tardy"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""party"" has T.\n\nSo ""hardy"" is a good representative.\n\nTherefore, let\'s guess ""HARDY"".Based on the cumulative feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"") feedback**: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  \n  This indicates that:  \n  - C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - R and A are in the secret word but not in positions 2 or 3 (since they were marked ""-"" in positions 2 and 3, respectively).\n\n- **Guess 2 (""parts"") feedback**: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x)  \n  This indicates that:  \n  - P, T, and S are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - A is **correctly placed at position 2**.  \n  - R is **correctly placed at position 3**.  \n\n### Deduced information about the secret word:\nThe secret word must:  \n- Be 5 letters long.  \n- Have the pattern `_ A R _ _` (since A is fixed at position 2 and R at position 3).  \n- Exclude the letters **C, E, N, P, T, S** (all marked absent in previous guesses).  \n- Include only letters from the remaining pool: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  \n\n### Strategy for the next guess:\n- The goal is to test new common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 to narrow down possibilities.  \n- We should avoid duplicating letters unnecessarily (though duplicates are possible if evidence suggests them), as there may be additional unknown letters.  \n- Common letters not yet tested include **L, M, D, Y, H, O, U, B**—prioritizing these can maximize information gain.  \n- Valid words fitting the `_ A R _ _` pattern without excluded letters include ""HARDY"" (tests H, D, Y), ""BARMY"" (tests B, M, Y), or ""LARDY"" (tests L, D, Y). ""HARDY"" is chosen because it uses high-frequency letters (H, D, Y) and is a common word.  \n\nThis guess will confirm or rule out H, D, and Y in their respective positions, bringing us closer to the solution.\n\n<guess>hardy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: hardy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)\n  Interpretation: \n    - C, N, E are not in the word.\n    - R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 (as per their positions in ""crane"").\n\nGuess 2: parts -> Feedback: P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(x), S(x)\n  Interpretation:\n    - P, T, S are not in the word.\n    - A is correctly placed at position 2.\n    - R is correctly placed at position 3.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has A at position 2 and R at position 3, and the pattern is _ A R _ _\n\nGuess 3: hardy -> Feedback: H(x), A(✓), R(✓), D(x), Y(✓)\n  Interpretation:\n    - H and D are not in the word.\n    - A is still correct at position 2 (as expected).\n    - R is still correct at position 3 (as expected).\n    - Y is correctly placed at position 5? Let\'s check the positions of ""hardy"":\n        Position 1: H, which is marked x (not present)\n        Position 2: A, marked ✓ (correct)\n        Position 3: R, marked ✓ (correct)\n        Position 4: D, marked x (not present)\n        Position 5: Y, marked ✓ (correct)\n\nSo the feedback shows Y is correct at position 5.\n\nTherefore, we now know that the secret word ends with Y at position 5. The word pattern is _ A R _ Y.\n\nAdditionally, we have accumulated absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, S, H, D.\n\nSo the known pattern is: [letter1] A R [letter4] Y\n\nAnd excluded letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D.\n\nWe need to find a valid 5-letter English word that matches this pattern and does not contain any excluded letters.\n\nPossible letters for position 1 and position 4 must come from the remaining letters: \nB, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z\n\nWe also note that from Guess 1, we had R marked with ""-"" meaning R was present but not in position 2 (which we now know because it\'s fixed at position 3). Similarly, A was present but not in position 3 (and we now know it\'s at position 2). There are no other known constraints.\n\nNow, let\'s think of words that fit _ A R _ Y.\n\nExamples: \n- ""Fairy"" -> F, A, I, R, Y? But our pattern requires the third letter to be R, and ""fairy"" is F-A-I-R-Y, so third letter is I, not R. Doesn\'t fit.\n- ""Harry"" -> excluded because H is absent? Also, H is excluded.\n- ""Marry"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we have two R\'s. Pattern: M(1), A(2), R(3) -> correct, then R(4), Y(5). But Y is correct at position 5. Is ""marry"" allowed? But note that the fourth letter would be R. However, we have excluded many letters but R is already in the word (at position 3). We don\'t know if the word has a second R.\n\nBut we have to consider that if we fill position 4 with R, then the word becomes _ A R R Y. But that might be a valid word?\n\nWords that fit:\n- ""Marry"": M A R R Y -> first letter M, fourth letter R.\n- ""Barry"": B A R R Y -> same pattern.\n- ""Carry"": excluded because C is absent.\n- ""Jarry"": J A R R Y? Is ""jarry"" a word? Not commonly recognized.\n- ""Parry"": excluded because P is absent.\n\nOther possibilities without duplicate R:\n- ""Warty"": but W A R T Y -> T is excluded? Yes, T is absent. Invalid.\n- ""Narky"": N is excluded? In guess1, N is absent. Invalid.\n- ""Sparky"": S and P are excluded, and pattern would be S P A R K Y? Not matching _ A R _ Y because first two letters would be S P? Actually, no: for the pattern, we need first letter, then A at 2, R at 3. ""Sparky"" has S at 1, P at 2, A at 3? Doesn\'t match.\n\nLet me list words matching _ A R _ Y that exist in English and are 5 letters.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""Marry"": M A R R Y\n- ""Barry"": B A R R Y (as a name, but it\'s accepted as a word)\n- ""Harry"": H excluded? H is absent. Invalid.\n- ""Tarry"": T excluded? Invalid.\n- ""Lardy"": L A R D Y -> but D is absent? In ""hardy"", D was marked absent? Yes, D is excluded. So invalid.\n- ""Fairy"": doesn\'t match because it\'s F-A-I-R-Y -> third letter is I, not R.\n\nWithout duplicate R:\n- ""Carboy"": but C excluded? Also, pattern C A R ... -> third letter R, then B O Y? This would be 6 letters? No, carboy is 6 letters? Actually, C-A-R-B-O-Y is 6 letters.\n\nAnother: ""Barmy"": B A R M Y -> pattern fits: position 1: B, 2: A, 3: R, 4: M, 5: Y. And letters: B, A, R, M, Y.\n\nNow, check against excluded letters: B, M, Y are not excluded? Excluded letters: C,E,N,P,T,S,H,D. So B, M, Y are allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""barmy"" is a valid word (adjective, meaning foolish).\n\nAlso, ""marry"" is M,A,R,R,Y. We must check if the fourth letter R is allowed? We have R already at position 3. The secret word might have two R\'s. But if we guess a word with two R\'s, it\'s acceptable unless we have constraints against it.\n\nBut we have two candidates: ""marry"" and ""barmy"".\n\nAre there others?\n- ""Gawky"": G A W K Y -> but third letter W? Not R. Doesn\'t fit.\n- ""Jazzy"": J A Z Z Y -> third letter Z? Not R.\n- ""Mangy"": M A N G Y -> N excluded? Invalid.\n\nSo possible words: ""marry"" and ""barmy"".\n\nWe have already guessed ""barmy"" or something similar? We have not guessed ""barmy"" yet.\n\nIn guess3 we guessed ""hardy"". We haven\'t guessed ""barmy"".\n\nBut note: in ""barmy"", the pattern is B A R M Y. Position 4 is M.\n\nIn the secret word, we don\'t know if it has M.\n\nSimilarly, in ""marry"", position 4 is R.\n\nHow can we decide? We have 3 tries left (since this will be guess4).\n\nWe can choose to guess ""barmy"" because it tests M at position 4.\n\nAlternatively, ""marry"" tests an extra R at position 4.\n\nBut we can also think: we know Y is at the end. And we need to solve the word.\n\nWe can choose a word that tests a different letter at position 1 and at position 4.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know what letter is at position 4 and position 1.\n\nSince we have two possibilities (or more), we can try one that covers a letter we haven\'t tested.\n\nIn ""barmy"" we use B and M, both of which are new and not tested before.\n\nSimilarly, ""marry"" uses M at position 1? ""marry"" uses M and R (again). But we already know R is present at position 3; if we use R at position 4, we won\'t test a new letter at position 4.\n\nTherefore, guessing ""barmy"" seems better because it tests two new letters: B and M.\n\nIf ""barmy"" turns out to be the word, we win. If not, the feedback will tell us about B and M.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""barmy"".\n\nAlso, note: we might have other words? Like ""warmly"" but that\'s 6 letters.\n\nOr ""fury"" too short.\n\nAnother word: ""fairy"" does not fit because it requires R at position 4? But pattern is _ A R _ Y, so position 3 is R, position 4 must be filled.\n\n""Airy"" is 4 letters.\n\nSo I think ""barmy"" is a strong candidate.\n\nBut let me confirm: is ""barmy"" a valid word? Yes, it is.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""barmy"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are present but misplaced, while C, N, and E are absent. This shows R and A are in the word, but not in positions 2 or 3.\n- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: A is correct at position 2, R is correct at position 3, while P, T, and S are absent. This confirms the secret word pattern is `_ A R _ _`.\n- **Guess 3 (""hardy"")**: A and R remain correct at positions 2 and 3, Y is correct at position 5, while H and D are absent. This updates the secret word pattern to `_ A R _ Y` and rules out H and D.\n\n### Deduced knowledge:\n- **Fixed positions**: Position 2 = A, Position 3 = R, Position 5 = Y → Pattern: `[letter1] A R [letter4] Y`.\n- **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D (8 letters total).\n- **Remaining possible letters**: B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n- **Unknowns**: Letters for positions 1 and 4 must be from the remaining pool.\n\n### Strategy for the next guess:\n- Prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., M, L, B, O, U) to maximize information gain.\n- Use a valid English word that fits the pattern `_ A R _ Y` and avoids absent letters.\n- Candidates include ""barmy"" (tests B, M, Y) or ""marry"" (tests M, duplicate R), but ""barmy"" is preferred to test new letters B and M in positions 1 and 4 simultaneously.\n- If ""barmy"" is correct, we solve it; otherwise, feedback on B and M will reduce possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>barmy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: hardy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: barmy -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(✓) M(-) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from the fourth guess ""barmy"":\n  B: absent (x)\n  A: correct position (✓) at position 2\n  R: correct position (✓) at position 3\n  M: present but wrong position (-) at position 4? Let\'s see the positions.\n\nIn ""barmy"":\n  Position 1: B → marked as absent (x)\n  Position 2: A → correct (✓)\n  Position 3: R → correct (✓)\n  Position 4: M → present but wrong position (-)\n  Position 5: Y → correct (✓)\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The secret word pattern remains: _ A R _ Y\n- The letter M is in the secret word but not in position 4.\n- Additionally, B is absent (added to the excluded list).\n\nNow we update our knowledge:\n\nFixed positions:\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: R\n  Position 5: Y\n\nLetters present that are not correctly placed:\n  M is present but not in position 4. So M must be in the secret word but not at position 4.\n\nAbsent letters: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B (from previous guesses)\n\nRemaining available letters: F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z\n\nBut we know M is present (just not in position 4), so M must be in the word. Therefore, M is in the word, but its correct position is not 4. Since we only have positions 1 and 4 left to find, M must be in position 1? Why? Because position 4 is the only other position besides position 1 that we don\'t know. And we know M is not in position 4 (as per feedback) so M must be in position 1? Not necessarily. We know M is not in position 4, and since position 2,3,5 are fixed, the only other position where M could be is position 1.\n\nTherefore:\n- Position 1 must be M? Because M is present and it cannot be in position 4? Actually, the word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Positions 2,3,5 are known and fixed: A, R, Y. So if M is in the word and not at position 4, then it must be at position 1? Because there are no other positions left? Wait, position 1 is the only unknown position left? No, we have two unknown positions: position 1 and position 4. But position 4 is not M? According to the feedback, M is in the word but not in position 4. It could be that position 1 is M? Or is there another possibility? But if M is in the word and not in position 4, and we only have position 1 and position 4 as variable, then position 1 must be M. Yes.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must have M at position 1? Then what is at position 4? Position 4 must be a letter that is not M and not excluded? And since M is at position 1, then the word is M A R ? Y.\n\nBut then the feedback for ""barmy"": we guessed B at position 1 and got absent? Now we know that position 1 should be M, not B? And we have M at position 4? But we also got M marked as present but wrong position. So if M were at position 1? Then in the secret word, M is at position 1? But in our guess ""barmy"", we put M at position 4? And the feedback said M is present but not in position 4, meaning its correct position is elsewhere? It could be position 1? Then yes.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the letter at position 1 is M? And the secret word is M A R ? Y.\n\nBut then the letter at position 4 is still unknown? And it must be a letter from the available set? But we know M is already at position 1, so position 4 must be another letter.\n\nMoreover, we must not use excluded letters? And we haven\'t tested many letters? But wait? Do we know if there are duplicate M\'s? We have no evidence? But given the feedback? The feedback for ""barmy"": we got B absent (for position 1), then A and R correct, M present but not in position 4? Then Y correct. So after getting the M at position 4 flagged as wrong position, and since position 1 is the only other unknown position? But actually, position 1 is also variable? So why can\'t position 1 be something else and M be only at position 4? But the feedback says M is not at position 4? So if we place M at position 1 in the secret word, then in the guess ""barmy"", we had M at position 4? Then it would be marked as absent if M is only at position 1? Or as present? Wait: in the secret word, if M is only at position 1? Then when we put M at position 4? We get a dash? Because M is in the word but not in position 4? That matches? So if the secret word has M at position 1, then it\'s consistent with the feedback? If the secret word has M at position 4? Then we would have gotten a check? But we didn\'t? We got a dash? Meaning it\'s present but not at position 4? So it cannot be at position 4? Therefore, if M is at position 1? Then yes? But also? It could be at position 1? Given the unknown positions? So it must be at position 1? Therefore:\n\nThe secret word is M A R ? Y.\n\nWhat can be the fourth letter? Position 4: must be a letter from the available set? Which is: F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? Without M? Because we already have M at position 1? And no duplicates? Unless? The secret word might have duplicate M? But we don\'t know? But let\'s assume no? Or wait: the feedback doesn\'t rule out duplicates? But we have no duplicate M? Because if there were a duplicate M? Then we didn\'t get any feedback that? We don\'t know? Actually, if we put M at position 4? And the secret word has M only at position 1? Then feedback would mark position 4 M as dash? Because it\'s in the word? But if it also had M at position 4? Then it would be marked as check? But we got a dash? Meaning M is in the word elsewhere? Not at position 4? So it doesn\'t necessarily imply that there is only one M? But if there were a duplicate? Then position 4 M might be marked as dash? Meaning the secret word has an M? But not at position 4? Then we don\'t know how many M\'s? Actually, it doesn\'t matter? Because we already know from this that there is an M at position 1? Because we have no other positions? Wait: if we assume the secret word has an M? And it\'s not at position 4? And positions 2,3,5 are fixed? Then it must be at position 1? So only one M? So there shouldn\'t be a duplicate? Therefore, position 1 is M? And position 4 is another letter? And that letter is not M? Because duplicate? Not necessary? But we don\'t know? However, we don\'t need to guess that? Because we can now guess a word starting with M? And A R at positions 2 and 3? Then some letter at position 4? And Y at position 5? So M A R ? Y.\n\nNow, we need to choose the letter at position 4? But we have many choices? So we should try to test several possibilities? But how? We have one guess? That can only put one letter at position 4? So we need to narrow down? But we have 2 guesses left? Since this is guess 4? Then next is guess 5? Then guess 6? We have two attempts? We can try to find a common letter? Or we can try to test multiple letters? But it\'s hard?\n\nAlternatively, we can think of valid English words matching M A R ? Y.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""Marly"" -> M A R L Y? Meaning? Like the place? But valid word.\n- ""Marvy"" -> M A R V Y? Informal for excellent? Valid? Maybe not very common? But acceptable.\n- ""Mary"" is 4 letters? Not.\n- ""Mardy"" -> M A R D Y? But D is excluded. Invalid.\n- ""Waray"" -> W A R A Y? Not matching? We need M at position 1? Pattern is M A R ? Y? So first letter M? Then A, R, then fourth letter, then Y.\n\nAlso? ""Marry"" is M A R R Y? But that has R at position 4? And we already have R? Is duplicate R allowed? But we haven\'t tested that? However, note that we know R is at position 3? So if we put R at position 4? It might be a duplicate? But in the feedback for guess 2? When we guessed ""parts""? We had R at position 3? And we got a check? Then for guess 3? ""hardy""? We had R at position 3? Check? So no duplicate? Or we don\'t know? Actually, we don\'t have any guess that tested R at position 4? So it could be that the secret word has a duplicate R? Or not?\n\nIn ""marry"": M, A, R, R, Y? So we have R at positions 3 and 4? Then position 3 R is fixed? Which we know is correct? Position 4 R would be part of the word? But in the feedback for ""barmy""? We had M at position 4? Which is dash? Meaning M is present but not at position 4? But we deduced that M must be at position 1? So if we put duplicate? But in ""marry""? There is no other M? Wait? ""marry"" does not have M? It has M at position 1? Then R at 3 and 4? Then Y at 5? So letters: M, A, R, R, Y.\n\nBut we have already concluded that position 1 must be M? Then position 4 is R? That is a duplicate R? This is possible? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? Wordle does allow duplicates? So it\'s possible? But what about M? The M is at position 1? So if the secret word is ""marry""? Then position 1 M? Position 2 A? Position 3 R? Position 4 R? Position 5 Y? Then in the guess ""barmy"": \n  Position 1: B -> absent? Correct? Because secret has M? Not B.\n  Position 2: A -> match.\n  Position 3: R -> match.\n  Position 4: M -> we guessed M? But secret has R? So M is not at position 4? Which is true? But is M in the word? Yes? At position 1? So M is present? But not at position 4? Therefore, we got a dash? Correct? And Y match? So yes? ""marry"" fits.\n\nSimilarly, we could have ""marly"": M A R L Y? Then position 4 is L? Which is an available letter.\n\nAlso, ""marked"" has 6 letters? Not.\n\nAnd ""marvy"" as I thought? Is it ""marvy""? Informal? Meaning marvelous? Yes.\n\nOther possibilities? ""maray""? Not a word? ""makay""? Not.\n\nSo the contenders are:\n- ""marry"" (M A R R Y) → duplicate R? And we haven\'t ruled it out?\n- ""marly"" (M A R L Y)\n- ""marvy"" (M A R V Y)\n\nBut we must not use excluded letters? We don\'t have L, V? Etc? Excluded? No? They are in the available list? Because excluded letters: C,E,N,P,T,S,H,D,B? So L, V are allowed.\n\nSo three candidates? We need to choose one? And we have two guesses left? We might need more information?\n\nBut if we guess ""marly""? For example? Then:\n- If it\'s the secret word? Success.\n- If not? The feedback might tell us about L? And also we test M at position 1? Which we think is true? But actually? We deduced M at position 1? So let\'s check another possibility? What if the secret word has M at position 4? But we got a dash for M at position 4 meaning not there? So it can\'t be at position 4? So it must be at position 1? Almost? But what about if the secret word has M at some other position? But the only other position? Position 1? So yes.\n\nTherefore, we must have M at position 1? So the word is M A R ? Y.\n\nBut then there are only 12 letters that ? at position 4 can be? So we need to guess.\n\nNow, to maximize information? We can try a word that tests the least common? But we may want to try one of the words that is common.\n\nAlternatively, we can list the possible words? We have 3: ""marry"", ""marly"", ""marvy""? But are there more?\n\n- ""marey""? Not a word?\n- ""mazey""? Meaning confusing? And Z is allowed? But pattern M A Z E Y? But third letter is Z? Not R! Must be R at position 3? So no.\n- ""mary"": too short.\n- ""murry"": meaning? Like? Not standard? M U R R Y? But first letter M? Then U? Then R? But position 2? Must be A? So A missing? No? Pattern is M A R ? Y? Position 2 must be A? So M A R then fourth letter? Then Y? So it must be ... ARY? Like? ""marsh"" is S excluded? And 5 letters? M A R S H? Excluded? And pattern? Position 5 H? But we need Y? So invalid.\n\nAnother: ""maply""? Not a word.\n\nSo common ones: ""marry"", ""marly"", ""marvy"".\n\nWe can also include ""jarry""? Or ""warly""? But less common.\n\nSince ""marry"" has duplicate R? Let\'s see why it might be acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s consider that we haven\'t tested any letters at position 4? So we don\'t know what it is? So we must guess? And we have two attempts? We can start with one? For example? Guess ""marly""? To test if L is at position 4? If it works? Good? Else? We know L is not at position 4? Then we can try another? Like ""marvy"" next? Etc? But we have only two guesses.\n\nAlternatively? We can choose a word that uses a common letter? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut note: we have feedback that told us M MUST be in position 1? So let\'s think of ""marry""? But if we guess ""marry""? Then:\n- We put M at position 1: it should be ✓? And A and R at positions 2 and 3: ✓? Then R at position 4: if the secret word has R at position 4? Then ✓? But if not? Then it might be marked as dash? Or? But we know R is not at position 4? Because R is fixed at position 3? And we don\'t know if there is a duplicate? So if we put R at position 4? It could be:\n  - If the secret word has only one R? Then R at position 4 would be marked as absent? But we know R is in the word at position 3? So we get an x? Meaning that letter at position 4 is not in the word? Or if it is a different letter? It would be dash if present?\n\nThis is confusing. Better to avoid duplicates in our guess? Because we already know M at position 1? So we can test a single letter at position 4? So we choose a word that has M at position 1? And a letter we haven\'t tested? So that if that letter is correct? We win? Else? We know it\'s another letter.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""marly"" to test L at position 4? Because L is common? Also? ""marvy"" has V which is less common? ""marry"" tests R at position 4? But we already know R? So it might not test a new letter? And might cause duplication issues.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""marly"".Based on the cumulative feedback and deductions:\n\n- **Pattern**: The secret word must be of the form `? A R ? Y`.\n- **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B (9 letters total).\n- **Present letters**:\n  - M is in the secret word but not in position 4 (as per Guess 4: ""barmy"" had M marked ""-"" at position 4).\n  - Since positions 2 (A), 3 (R), and 5 (Y) are fixed, and M is present but not at position 4, **M must be at position 1**. Thus, the secret word pattern is `M A R ? Y`.\n- **Remaining unknown**: Only position 4 is unknown. Its letter must be from the unfiltered pool (F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z) and not absent from prior guesses.\n\n### Strategy for the next guess:\n- Test a valid English word fitting `M A R ? Y`, prioritizing common letters like **L** (in ""marly"") or **V** (in ""marvy""). \n- ""Marly"" (M A R L Y) is chosen because:\n  - ""L"" is a high-frequency letter not yet tested.\n  - It tests position 4 specifically with L.\n  - If correct, game ends; if incorrect, feedback on L will reduce possibilities for the final guess.\n\nGiven the constraints, ""marly"" is a safe guess to optimize the remaining attempts.\n\n<guess>marly</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are present but not in positions 2 or 3; C, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""parts"")**: A is correct at position 2, R is correct at position 3; P, T, S are absent. The pattern is `_ A R _ _`.\n- **Guess 3 (""hardy"")**: A and R remain correct; Y is correct at position 5; H and D are absent. The pattern updates to `_ A R _ Y`.\n- **Guess 4 (""barmy"")**: A, R, and Y are correct; B is absent; M is present but not in position 4. The presence of M and pattern constraints (fixed A, R, Y) force M to **position 1**, as it cannot be in position 4.\n\n### Deduced knowledge:\n- **Fixed pattern**: `M A R ? Y`  \n- **Position 4 must be a letter not excluded**: Absent letters are C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B.  \n- **Possible candidates** for position 4 include common letters like L, V, O, or U (from remaining pool: F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).  \n- Valid words fitting the pattern include ""marly"" (tests L), ""marvy"" (tests V), or ""mary"" (invalid length; ""marry"" duplicates R).  \n\n### Strategy for this guess:\n- Test ""marly"" (M A R L Y) to check L at position 4—a high-frequency letter.  \n- If incorrect, feedback on L (present/absent) will isolate position 4 options for the final guess.\n\n<guess>marly</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: parts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: hardy -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: barmy -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(✓) M(-) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: marly -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the fifth guess ""marly"":
  M: correct (✓) at position 1
  A: correct (✓) at position 2
  R: correct (✓) at position 3
  L: absent (x) at position 4
  Y: correct (✓) at position 5

So the feedback shows that L is not in the word.

Therefore, we update our knowledge:

- The secret word is M A R ? Y, and the ? (position 4) is not L.
- Additionally, L is absent, so we add L to the excluded letters.

Now, the excluded letters are: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B, L.

The available letters for position 4 are: F, G, I, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to find a valid 5-letter English word that fits M A R ? Y, with the fourth letter being one of the available letters.

Possible words:
- ""Marvy"" (M A R V Y) → meaning excellent or marvelous (informal). Valid.
- ""Mary"" is 4 letters, not 5.
- ""Mardy"" has D, which is excluded.
- ""Marky"" has K? But K is available? ""Marky"" is a name? Not common word? But might be accepted? However, we need a valid word.
- ""Marly"" we just tried and L is absent.

Other possibilities:
- ""Marvy"" seems the most common.
- ""Marry"" has duplicate R? But we already have R at position 3? So ""marry"" is M A R R Y. But we haven't tested R at position 4? However, in the feedback for ""barmy"", we had M at position 4 marked as present but wrong position? And we deduced M must be at position 1? So if we try ""marry"", then position 4 is R? But we know R is at position 3? So if the secret word has two R's? Then it would be acceptable? But we don't know? However, we have not excluded R? But we have already used R? But we can use it again? But in this case, we are trying to find the word? So we can try? But we have only one guess left? So we must be careful.

But note: we have already fixed M, A, R, Y? And we are only missing position 4? So we need to choose a letter for position 4? That is not excluded? And forms a valid word.

""Marry"" would be M A R R Y? So the fourth letter is R? But we haven't tested that? And R is already in the word? So if the secret word has only one R? Then position 4 R would be marked as absent? But we know R is in the word? So it might be confusing? But actually, in the feedback? If we put R at position 4? And the secret word has only one R at position 3? Then the feedback for position 4 would be absent? Because that R is not in the word? Since the only R is at position 3? So we would get an x? Meaning that letter is not in the word? But we know R is in the word? But it's already accounted for? So it would be marked as absent? So we can get an x? Then we know it's not R? But we have only one guess? So if we guess ""marry"" and it's not the word? We lose? Because we have no more guesses? Actually, we have one more guess? This is guess 5? We have 6 guesses? So we can make one more? Guess 6.

But we are at guess 5? Then we have one more? Guess 6.

But we want to solve it in this guess? Or we can use this to test? But we have to make a guess? And if it's not the word? We get feedback? Then we can use the last guess.

But to be efficient? We can try a word that is likely? Or we can try to test a letter? But we have only one position? So we must guess a specific word.

Now, the most common word that fits? ""Marvy"" is a possibility? But is it common? Or ""marly"" we tried? And L is out.

Another word: ""marvy"" is the only one I can think of? Or ""marcs"" but S excluded? And not Y at end.

""Marvy"" seems the best candidate.

But let me confirm: is ""marvy"" a valid word? Yes, it is an informal adjective meaning excellent.

Also, V is in the available letters.

Therefore, we guess ""marvy"".

If it's not? Then we get feedback? And we have one more guess? But we hope it is.

But note: we have not tested V? So if we get feedback that V is absent? Then we know it's not? And we can try another letter? But we have only one guess left? So we need to list all possible words? But there are many? Like with F, G, I, etc? But we don't know common words? So we might not solve? But we have to try.

Alternatively? We can think of other words? Like ""margo""? But not ending with Y? We need Y at the end.

""Margy"" is not a word? ""Marge"" has E excluded.

So ""marvy"" is a good choice.

Therefore, we guess ""marvy"".Based on the feedback from Guess 5 (""marly""):

- **Feedback**: M(✓), A(✓), R(✓), L(x), Y(✓)  
  This confirms:  
  - The secret word starts with M, has A at position 2, R at position 3, and Y at position 5.  
  - L is absent from the secret word.  

### Deduced knowledge:  
- **Pattern**: `M A R ? Y` (only position 4 is unknown).  
- **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B, L (10 letters total).  
- **Remaining possible letters for position 4**: F, G, I, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Valid word candidates**:  
  - ""marvy"" (M A R V Y) is a valid informal English word meaning ""excellent"".  
  - Other rare possibilities (e.g., ""marky"", ""mary"") are invalid or don't fit the pattern.  

### Strategy for the next guess:  
- ""marvy"" is the strongest candidate given common vocabulary.  
- If incorrect, feedback on V (present/absent) will allow deduction of position 4 in the final guess (if needed).  

<guess>marvy</guess>
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - C (x), R (-), A (-), N (x), E (x)  
   → R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.  
   → C, N, E are absent.  

2. **Guess 2: ""parts""**  
   - P (x), A (✓), R (✓), T (x), S (x)  
   → A is **correct at position 2**, R is **correct at position 3**.  
   → P, T, S are absent.  
   → Secret pattern: `_ A R _ _`.  

3. **Guess 3: ""hardy""**  
   - H (x), A (✓), R (✓), D (x), Y (✓)  
   → Y is **correct at position 5**.  
   → H, D are absent.  
   → Secret pattern: `_ A R _ Y`.  

4. **Guess 4: ""barmy""**  
   - B (x), A (✓), R (✓), M (-), Y (✓)  
   → M is **present but not at position 4**.  
   → B is absent.  
   → Since positions 2, 3, 5 are fixed (A, R, Y), M must be at position 1.  
   → Secret pattern: `M A R ? Y`.  

5. **Guess 5: ""marly""**  
   - M (✓), A (✓), R (✓), L (x), Y (✓)  
   → Confirms M is **correct at position 1**.  
   → L is absent.  
   → Secret pattern: `M A R ? Y` (only position 4 is unknown).  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Fixed letters**:  
  - Position 1: **M**  
  - Position 2: **A**  
  - Position 3: **R**  
  - Position 5: **Y**  
- **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B, L (10 letters).  
- **Position 4 possibilities**: F, G, I, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Valid words** fitting `M A R ? Y`:  
  - Common: **""marvy""** (M A R V Y, meaning ""excellent"").  
  - Rare: ""marky"" (invalid), ""mary"" (invalid length), ""mardy"" (D excluded).  

### Strategy for Guess 6:
- **""marvy""** is the strongest candidate:  
  - Tests **V** at position 4 (a plausible letter).  
  - If correct, solves the puzzle.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on V (absent/present) would isolate the solution for a final guess (though no guesses remain after this).  

<guess>marvy</guess>",marvy,"We have the feedback from the fifth guess ""marly"":
  M: correct (✓) at position 1
  A: correct (✓) at position 2
  R: correct (✓) at position 3
  L: absent (x) at position 4
  Y: correct (✓) at position 5

So the feedback shows that L is not in the word.

Therefore, we update our knowledge:

- The secret word is M A R ? Y, and the ? (position 4) is not L.
- Additionally, L is absent, so we add L to the excluded letters.

Now, the excluded letters are: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B, L.

The available letters for position 4 are: F, G, I, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to find a valid 5-letter English word that fits M A R ? Y, with the fourth letter being one of the available letters.

Possible words:
- ""Marvy"" (M A R V Y) → meaning excellent or marvelous (informal). Valid.
- ""Mary"" is 4 letters, not 5.
- ""Mardy"" has D, which is excluded.
- ""Marky"" has K? But K is available? ""Marky"" is a name? Not common word? But might be accepted? However, we need a valid word.
- ""Marly"" we just tried and L is absent.

Other possibilities:
- ""Marvy"" seems the most common.
- ""Marry"" has duplicate R? But we already have R at position 3? So ""marry"" is M A R R Y. But we haven't tested R at position 4? However, in the feedback for ""barmy"", we had M at position 4 marked as present but wrong position? And we deduced M must be at position 1? So if we try ""marry"", then position 4 is R? But we know R is at position 3? So if the secret word has two R's? Then it would be acceptable? But we don't know? However, we have not excluded R? But we have already used R? But we can use it again? But in this case, we are trying to find the word? So we can try? But we have only one guess left? So we must be careful.

But note: we have already fixed M, A, R, Y? And we are only missing position 4? So we need to choose a letter for position 4? That is not excluded? And forms a valid word.

""Marry"" would be M A R R Y? So the fourth letter is R? But we haven't tested that? And R is already in the word? So if the secret word has only one R? Then position 4 R would be marked as absent? But we know R is in the word? So it might be confusing? But actually, in the feedback? If we put R at position 4? And the secret word has only one R at position 3? Then the feedback for position 4 would be absent? Because that R is not in the word? Since the only R is at position 3? So we would get an x? Meaning that letter is not in the word? But we know R is in the word? But it's already accounted for? So it would be marked as absent? So we can get an x? Then we know it's not R? But we have only one guess? So if we guess ""marry"" and it's not the word? We lose? Because we have no more guesses? Actually, we have one more guess? This is guess 5? We have 6 guesses? So we can make one more? Guess 6.

But we are at guess 5? Then we have one more? Guess 6.

But we want to solve it in this guess? Or we can use this to test? But we have to make a guess? And if it's not the word? We get feedback? Then we can use the last guess.

But to be efficient? We can try a word that is likely? Or we can try to test a letter? But we have only one position? So we must guess a specific word.

Now, the most common word that fits? ""Marvy"" is a possibility? But is it common? Or ""marly"" we tried? And L is out.

Another word: ""marvy"" is the only one I can think of? Or ""marcs"" but S excluded? And not Y at end.

""Marvy"" seems the best candidate.

But let me confirm: is ""marvy"" a valid word? Yes, it is an informal adjective meaning excellent.

Also, V is in the available letters.

Therefore, we guess ""marvy"".

If it's not? Then we get feedback? And we have one more guess? But we hope it is.

But note: we have not tested V? So if we get feedback that V is absent? Then we know it's not? And we can try another letter? But we have only one guess left? So we need to list all possible words? But there are many? Like with F, G, I, etc? But we don't know common words? So we might not solve? But we have to try.

Alternatively? We can think of other words? Like ""margo""? But not ending with Y? We need Y at the end.

""Margy"" is not a word? ""Marge"" has E excluded.

So ""marvy"" is a good choice.

Therefore, we guess ""marvy"".Based on the feedback from Guess 5 (""marly""):

- **Feedback**: M(✓), A(✓), R(✓), L(x), Y(✓)  
  This confirms:  
  - The secret word starts with M, has A at position 2, R at position 3, and Y at position 5.  
  - L is absent from the secret word.  

### Deduced knowledge:  
- **Pattern**: `M A R ? Y` (only position 4 is unknown).  
- **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B, L (10 letters total).  
- **Remaining possible letters for position 4**: F, G, I, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Valid word candidates**:  
  - ""marvy"" (M A R V Y) is a valid informal English word meaning ""excellent"".  
  - Other rare possibilities (e.g., ""marky"", ""mary"") are invalid or don't fit the pattern.  

### Strategy for the next guess:  
- ""marvy"" is the strongest candidate given common vocabulary.  
- If incorrect, feedback on V (present/absent) will allow deduction of position 4 in the final guess (if needed).  

<guess>marvy</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - C (x), R (-), A (-), N (x), E (x)  
   → R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.  
   → C, N, E are absent.  

2. **Guess 2: ""parts""**  
   - P (x), A (✓), R (✓), T (x), S (x)  
   → A is **correct at position 2**, R is **correct at position 3**.  
   → P, T, S are absent.  
   → Secret pattern: `_ A R _ _`.  

3. **Guess 3: ""hardy""**  
   - H (x), A (✓), R (✓), D (x), Y (✓)  
   → Y is **correct at position 5**.  
   → H, D are absent.  
   → Secret pattern: `_ A R _ Y`.  

4. **Guess 4: ""barmy""**  
   - B (x), A (✓), R (✓), M (-), Y (✓)  
   → M is **present but not at position 4**.  
   → B is absent.  
   → Since positions 2, 3, 5 are fixed (A, R, Y), M must be at position 1.  
   → Secret pattern: `M A R ? Y`.  

5. **Guess 5: ""marly""**  
   - M (✓), A (✓), R (✓), L (x), Y (✓)  
   → Confirms M is **correct at position 1**.  
   → L is absent.  
   → Secret pattern: `M A R ? Y` (only position 4 is unknown).  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Fixed letters**:  
  - Position 1: **M**  
  - Position 2: **A**  
  - Position 3: **R**  
  - Position 5: **Y**  
- **Absent letters**: C, E, N, P, T, S, H, D, B, L (10 letters).  
- **Position 4 possibilities**: F, G, I, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Valid words** fitting `M A R ? Y`:  
  - Common: **""marvy""** (M A R V Y, meaning ""excellent"").  
  - Rare: ""marky"" (invalid), ""mary"" (invalid length), ""mardy"" (D excluded).  

### Strategy for Guess 6:
- **""marvy""** is the strongest candidate:  
  - Tests **V** at position 4 (a plausible letter).  
  - If correct, solves the puzzle.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on V (absent/present) would isolate the solution for a final guess (though no guesses remain after this).",Guess 6: marvy -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) R(✓) V(x) Y(✓),FAIL
