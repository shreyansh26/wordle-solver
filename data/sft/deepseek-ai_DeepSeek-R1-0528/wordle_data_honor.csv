We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
 - The letters are all distinct.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the word.
 - R is in the word but not in the correct position (so R is somewhere else).
 - A is not in the word.
 - N is in the word but not in the correct position.
 - E is not in the word.

 Therefore, the secret word contains R and N, but not C, A, or E.

 Also, note that R and N are not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"". Since ""CRANE"" has R as the 2nd letter and N as the 4th letter, the secret word has R not in position 2 and N not in position 4.

 Now, for our next guess, we should:
 1. Include R and N (since we know they are in the word).
 2. Avoid C, A, E.
 3. Use new letters that are common to gather more information.

 We also note the positions: 
   Position 1: not C (and not R since R was in position 2 originally? But wait, R is not at position 2 but might be at position 1? Actually, in ""CRANE"", R was in position 2 but we know it's not correct. We don't know if position 1 is ruled out for R? Actually, no: the feedback doesn't tell us that R can't be in position 1, only that it isn't in position 2. Similarly, N isn't in position 4 but could be elsewhere.

 However, note that the feedback for R was '-' meaning it is present but not at position 2. Similarly, N is present but not at position 4.

 So in our next guess, we can try to place R and N in different positions.

 Let's think of words that contain R and N, and without C, A, E.

 Common letters left: we have many consonants and vowels. We know the word doesn't have A or E (vowels are important). So the vowels must be from I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

 Given that, let's try to use another vowel: O or U or I.

 Also, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, E.

 Let's try to guess a word that includes R and N, and preferably with common letters we haven't tried.

 Possibilities: words like ""BORNS"", ""HORNS"", ""TORNS"" but note we need 5 letters.

 However, we must be cautious: we also know that R was in position 2 in our first guess and it was wrong, so in the new word we should put R in a different position. Similarly for N: it was in position 4 and wrong, so we put N in a different position.

 Let's brainstorm some words:
 - Option: ""IRONY"" - but I and Y are new, and O is new. However, note that we don't know if Y is allowed? The rules say English word, yes. But let's check the structure: ""IRONY"" would place R in the second position again? Actually, ""IRONY"": I _ R _ at position 1, R at position 2? But we have R in our word and we know it wasn't in position 2 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback only said that R is in the word but not in position 2. We can still try R at position 2? Why not? Actually, we can't? Wait: if we put R in position 2 again, we might get the same feedback? But we know the secret word doesn't have R at position 2. So we should avoid putting R at position 2 again? Actually, the game allows us to do so, but it would not give new information? So we should avoid.

 So let's avoid position 2 for R and position 4 for N.

 Other options: 
 - ""HORNS"": H O R N S -> R is at position 3 and N at position 4. That moves R and N? We know that in the secret word, N is not in position 4? So putting N at position 4 would be wasteful? But actually, the feedback we got said that when we had N at position 4, it was present but not correct. So that doesn't prevent the secret word from having N at position 4? Wait, no: the feedback for N was '-' meaning it is present but not at that position. So the secret word has N somewhere else. Therefore, the secret word does NOT have N at position 4. Similarly, R is not at position 2. Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2 and N at position 4.

 Therefore, in ""HORNS"": 
   R is at position 3 (which is not 2 -> allowed) 
   N is at position 4 -> but we know N is NOT in the secret word at position 4? So we should not put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it will be marked as wrong again? It doesn't give new information? So we should avoid placing N at position 4.

 Therefore, choose a word with N not at position 4.

 Another idea: ""RUNNY"" has repeated N? And R at position 1? But we don't want repeated letters unless necessary? And it has U and Y. But also, repeated N may complicate.

 Let me think of a word with R and N, without C, A, E, and without R in position 2 and N in position 4?

 Example words:
 - ""GROIN"": G R O I N -> R is in position 2? Avoid: we know R should not be at position 2? Actually, we can't use position 2 for R? We know the secret word doesn't have R at position 2? So we avoid position 2 for R.
   Therefore, not ""GROIN"".

 - ""PRONG"": P R O N G -> R is in position 2? Avoid.

 - ""STERN"": S T E R N -> but E is in the word? We know E is absent? So no.

 - ""STRIP"": S T R I P -> has no N? But we must have N.

 We need a word that includes at least R and N.

 - ""TRUNK"": T R U N K -> R is at position 2? Skip.

 - ""BLURT"": no N.

 - ""BORNE"": but E is absent? Skip.

 - ""URBAN"": has A? Skip.

 - ""HORNS"" we had: and we avoid N at position 4.

 How about ""HORNY"": H O R N Y -> 
   Positions: 
      H(1) -> new
      O(2) -> new
      R(3) -> not position 2 -> ok
      N(4) -> position 4? But we know N is not in position 4? Then why put it there? We would get a '-' again? So we avoid.

 How about moving N to a different position? Like position 5? 

 Words: ""ROUND"": R O U N D -> 
   R is at position 1: that's not position 2 -> ok.
   N is at position 4 -> we must avoid? Actually, the feedback for N was '-' meaning N is not at position 4? So putting N at position 4 again would be not good? But actually, the secret word has N, but not in position 4. So when we put N at position 4, it should show as '-' (if it's really not there) and that doesn't tell us anything new? So we lose one chance? Therefore, we can do it? But we waste a slot? We are at guess 2, so we want as much info as possible.

 Alternatively, we could put N in a position we haven't tried? Then we can know if it belongs there.

 We have positions: 1, 3, 5 we haven't placed N? Because we tried position 4.

 So let's try a word with R and N, with N not in position 4.

 Example: ""CORNS"" has C? We know C is absent.

 What about ""LORDS""? Doesn't have N? Skip.

 Another: ""MINOR"": M I N O R -> 
   Positions: N at position 3? R at position 5?
   That avoids position 2 for R and position 4 for N? Yes, since:
      M(1), I(2), N(3), O(4), R(5)
   Then R is at position 5? which is new? And N is at position 3? which we haven't tried.

 Also, letters M, I, O are new. And we avoid C, A, E.

 But note: we must make sure we don't use any of the absent letters (C, A, E). This word has M, I, N, O, R -> all new? So it's good? Wait, I is a vowel? Yes.

 So let me select ""MINOR"": 
   We place:
      M: at position 1 (new)
      I: at position 2 (new vowel)
      N: at position 3 (since we know it's not at 4, and 3 is new)
      O: at position 4 (new vowel)
      R: at position 5 (we know it's not at 2? and 5 is new)

 Also, we avoid position 2 for R? Yes: we placed R at position 5.

 Therefore, ""MINOR"" is a valid guess.

 However, note: what if the secret word has N at position 1? Then we haven't tested that? But that's okay? We have two known letters and we are trying new positions.

 Alternatively, we can try ""DINER""? But E? Skip.

 Or ""HINGE""? E? Skip.

 So let's go with ""MINOR"".

 But wait: we know R is in the word? So we are putting it at position 5? That might be right? Or it might not? We'll see.

 Since we don't know the positions, it's worth trying.

 Therefore, the next guess: ""MINOR"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- **C**, **A**, and **E** are **absent**.  
- **R** and **N** are **present** but **misplaced** (not in positions 2 or 4, respectively).  

For the second guess:  
- Must include **R** and **N**, but avoid **C**, **A**, **E**.  
- Use new letters to maximize information.  
- Avoid repeating misplaced positions: **R** cannot be in position 2, **N** cannot be in position 4.  

Chose ""MINOR"" because:  
- Contains **R** (position 5) and **N** (position 3), avoiding invalid positions.  
- Introduces common new letters: **M**, **I**, **O**.  
- Tests vowels **I** and **O**, as **A** and **E** are ruled out.

 Therefore, the secret word contains R and N, but not C, A, or E.

 Also, note that R and N are not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"". Since ""CRANE"" has R as the 2nd letter and N as the 4th letter, the secret word has R not in position 2 and N not in position 4.

 Now, for our next guess, we should:
 1. Include R and N (since we know they are in the word).
 2. Avoid C, A, E.
 3. Use new letters that are common to gather more information.

 We also note the positions: 
   Position 1: not C (and not R since R was in position 2 originally? But wait, R is not at position 2 but might be at position 1? Actually, in ""CRANE"", R was in position 2 but we know it's not correct. We don't know if position 1 is ruled out for R? Actually, no: the feedback doesn't tell us that R can't be in position 1, only that it isn't in position 2. Similarly, N isn't in position 4 but could be elsewhere.

 However, note that the feedback for R was '-' meaning it is present but not at position 2. Similarly, N is present but not at position 4.

 So in our next guess, we can try to place R and N in different positions.

 Let's think of words that contain R and N, and without C, A, E.

 Common letters left: we have many consonants and vowels. We know the word doesn't have A or E (vowels are important). So the vowels must be from I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

 Given that, let's try to use another vowel: O or U or I.

 Also, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, E.

 Let's try to guess a word that includes R and N, and preferably with common letters we haven't tried.

 Possibilities: words like ""BORNS"", ""HORNS"", ""TORNS"" but note we need 5 letters.

 However, we must be cautious: we also know that R was in position 2 in our first guess and it was wrong, so in the new word we should put R in a different position. Similarly for N: it was in position 4 and wrong, so we put N in a different position.

 Let's brainstorm some words:
 - Option: ""IRONY"" - but I and Y are new, and O is new. However, note that we don't know if Y is allowed? The rules say English word, yes. But let's check the structure: ""IRONY"" would place R in the second position again? Actually, ""IRONY"": I _ R _ at position 1, R at position 2? But we have R in our word and we know it wasn't in position 2 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback only said that R is in the word but not in position 2. We can still try R at position 2? Why not? Actually, we can't? Wait: if we put R in position 2 again, we might get the same feedback? But we know the secret word doesn't have R at position 2. So we should avoid putting R at position 2 again? Actually, the game allows us to do so, but it would not give new information? So we should avoid.

 So let's avoid position 2 for R and position 4 for N.

 Other options: 
 - ""HORNS"": H O R N S -> R is at position 3 and N at position 4. That moves R and N? We know that in the secret word, N is not in position 4? So putting N at position 4 would be wasteful? But actually, the feedback we got said that when we had N at position 4, it was present but not correct. So that doesn't prevent the secret word from having N at position 4? Wait, no: the feedback for N was '-' meaning it is present but not at that position. So the secret word has N somewhere else. Therefore, the secret word does NOT have N at position 4. Similarly, R is not at position 2. Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2 and N at position 4.

 Therefore, in ""HORNS"": 
   R is at position 3 (which is not 2 -> allowed) 
   N is at position 4 -> but we know N is NOT in the secret word at position 4? So we should not put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it will be marked as wrong again? It doesn't give new information? So we should avoid placing N at position 4.

 Therefore, choose a word with N not at position 4.

 Another idea: ""RUNNY"" has repeated N? And R at position 1? But we don't want repeated letters unless necessary? And it has U and Y. But also, repeated N may complicate.

 Let me think of a word with R and N, without C, A, E, and without R in position 2 and N in position 4?

 Example words:
 - ""GROIN"": G R O I N -> R is in position 2? Avoid: we know R should not be at position 2? Actually, we can't use position 2 for R? We know the secret word doesn't have R at position 2? So we avoid position 2 for R.
   Therefore, not ""GROIN"".

 - ""PRONG"": P R O N G -> R is in position 2? Avoid.

 - ""STERN"": S T E R N -> but E is in the word? We know E is absent? So no.

 - ""STRIP"": S T R I P -> has no N? But we must have N.

 We need a word that includes at least R and N.

 - ""TRUNK"": T R U N K -> R is at position 2? Skip.

 - ""BLURT"": no N.

 - ""BORNE"": but E is absent? Skip.

 - ""URBAN"": has A? Skip.

 - ""HORNS"" we had: and we avoid N at position 4.

 How about ""HORNY"": H O R N Y -> 
   Positions: 
      H(1) -> new
      O(2) -> new
      R(3) -> not position 2 -> ok
      N(4) -> position 4? But we know N is not in position 4? Then why put it there? We would get a '-' again? So we avoid.

 How about moving N to a different position? Like position 5? 

 Words: ""ROUND"": R O U N D -> 
   R is at position 1: that's not position 2 -> ok.
   N is at position 4 -> we must avoid? Actually, the feedback for N was '-' meaning N is not at position 4? So putting N at position 4 again would be not good? But actually, the secret word has N, but not in position 4. So when we put N at position 4, it should show as '-' (if it's really not there) and that doesn't tell us anything new? So we lose one chance? Therefore, we can do it? But we waste a slot? We are at guess 2, so we want as much info as possible.

 Alternatively, we could put N in a position we haven't tried? Then we can know if it belongs there.

 We have positions: 1, 3, 5 we haven't placed N? Because we tried position 4.

 So let's try a word with R and N, with N not in position 4.

 Example: ""CORNS"" has C? We know C is absent.

 What about ""LORDS""? Doesn't have N? Skip.

 Another: ""MINOR"": M I N O R -> 
   Positions: N at position 3? R at position 5?
   That avoids position 2 for R and position 4 for N? Yes, since:
      M(1), I(2), N(3), O(4), R(5)
   Then R is at position 5? which is new? And N is at position 3? which we haven't tried.

 Also, letters M, I, O are new. And we avoid C, A, E.

 But note: we must make sure we don't use any of the absent letters (C, A, E). This word has M, I, N, O, R -> all new? So it's good? Wait, I is a vowel? Yes.

 So let me select ""MINOR"": 
   We place:
      M: at position 1 (new)
      I: at position 2 (new vowel)
      N: at position 3 (since we know it's not at 4, and 3 is new)
      O: at position 4 (new vowel)
      R: at position 5 (we know it's not at 2? and 5 is new)

 Also, we avoid position 2 for R? Yes: we placed R at position 5.

 Therefore, ""MINOR"" is a valid guess.

 However, note: what if the secret word has N at position 1? Then we haven't tested that? But that's okay? We have two known letters and we are trying new positions.

 Alternatively, we can try ""DINER""? But E? Skip.

 Or ""HINGE""? E? Skip.

 So let's go with ""MINOR"".

 But wait: we know R is in the word? So we are putting it at position 5? That might be right? Or it might not? We'll see.

 Since we don't know the positions, it's worth trying.

 Therefore, the next guess: ""MINOR"".

<guess>minor</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- **C**, **A**, and **E** are **absent**.  
- **R** and **N** are **present** but **misplaced** (not in positions 2 or 4, respectively).  

For the second guess:  
- Must include **R** and **N**, but avoid **C**, **A**, **E**.  
- Use new letters to maximize information.  
- Avoid repeating misplaced positions: **R** cannot be in position 2, **N** cannot be in position 4.  

Chose ""MINOR"" because:  
- Contains **R** (position 5) and **N** (position 3), avoiding invalid positions.  
- Introduces common new letters: **M**, **I**, **O**.  
- Tests vowels **I** and **O**, as **A** and **E** are ruled out.

We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: CRANE**
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, but not in position 2 (-)
- A: absent (x)
- N: present, but not in position 4 (-)
- E: absent (x)

So, the secret word contains R and N, but not C, A, or E.

**Guess 2: MINOR**
- M: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- N: correct position (position 3)! (✓)
- O: correct position (position 4)! (✓)
- R: correct position (position 5)! (✓)

Therefore, we know:
- N is in position 3.
- O is in position 4.
- R is in position 5.
- The letters M and I are absent.

So the secret word has:
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: R
- And from guess 1, R is in the word (now confirmed in position 5) and N is in the word (confirmed in position 3). Also, no C, A, E, M, or I.

Since we have three letters fixed: [?, ?, N, O, R]

We need to find the first two letters. We know the first two are not C, A, E, M, I, and they cannot be R (since R is at the end? But note: we have R at position 5 only; R might be elsewhere? Actually, the feedback from the first guess: R was misplaced, but now we have R at position 5, so it must be that R is only at position 5? But wait: the secret word might have two R's? However, we don't know. But in feedback, we only know that there is at least one R. Since we had R at position 2 in the first guess which was wrong, now R at position 5 is correct. So if there were two R's, then the feedback would have shown two indicators? But in the first guess, we had only one R (which was at position 2) and got a ""-"", meaning R is present but not at that position. Now at position 5 we have a ""✓"". So if the word had two R's, then in the first guess, we got one ""-"" for R? But we don't have extra feedback. Actually, Wordle-style games usually show when a letter is repeated: if the guess has two identical letters and the secret word has two, then both would be marked appropriately. But in the first guess ""CRANE"" only has one R? So we don't know if there are two R's? Actually, we only know that if we try two R's and the feedback shows two marks. Currently, we haven't tried a word with two R's? So we can't rule out duplicate R's? Wait, the secret word is ""N O R"" at positions 3,4,5? Then positions 1 and 2 are not R? Because if there were a duplicate R? Actually, we haven't encountered any feedback that requires duplicate R's? So we can proceed without that? But we must be cautious. Alternatively, since R is in position 5, and we know it wasn't in position 2 (from first guess) and now we have it in position 5? Then positions 1 and 2 could be any letter except the ones we know? Wait: but if the secret word had an R at position 1, then we would have: at position 5 also? Then we would have two R's? But in the feedback for the first guess, we only saw one R? Because we only had one R? So: the secret word must have at least one R? But it could have two? However, since in ""MINOR"" we have R at position 5 and got a ""✓"", and in ""CRANE"" we got a ""-"" for R (meaning it's present), so that R must have been accounted for? Unless the two identical letters? Actually, we haven't eliminated the possibility? But let's see: if the secret word had two R's? Then we haven't encountered any conflict? But for simplicity, let's assume for now that we haven't tried a duplicate? So we cannot be certain? However, note that the first guess ""CRANE"" did not have R at position 5? So we wouldn't have gotten feedback about position 5? That R might be there? Wait: in the first guess, we only tested R at position 2? So it could have been at position 5? Then we get the ""-"" for R? Which doesn't tell us which R? Actually, no: the secret word has R at position 5? So when we tested R at position 2, it was not correct? But that R exists at position 5? So we show a ""-"" for the R? Because the letter R is present? But we don't specify which one? Wait: no duplication? Then only one R? Therefore, there is exactly one R at position 5? Similarly, for N? How about duplicates for N? The first guess: N was in position 4? It was misplaced? Then now we tested N in position 3? Correct? So the secret word has exactly one N? Because if we had two N's? Then in the first guess, we only got one ""-"" for N? Meaning one of the N's? But now we have N at position 3? Then we got a ""✓"" for position 3? Then the other N? But we didn't test? So we can't know? But in the second guess, we tested only one N? So we got one ""✓"". Therefore, we don't know? However, the word is 5 letters? And we have positions 3,4,5 fixed? So we only have two positions left? So if the word had two R's? And we have R at position 5? Then position 1 or 2 must be R? Similarly? But we have a word ending with R? Like ""??NOR"". Then if we had two R's? Then the letters would be R in positions 1 or 2? But let's see the feedback from the first guess? We have R at position 2? And got a ""-"", meaning that R is present? Because we matched? But wait: if the word has R at position 2? Then we would have a ""✓"" at position 2? But we didn't? So R is not at position 2? Therefore, if the word had two R's? One at position 5 and one at position 2? Then the R at position 5 was not tested? But when we tested position 2? The R at position 2? Then feedback would show ""✓"" if R is at position 2? Or ""-"" if not? But we tested R at position 2 and got ""-"", so the secret word does not have R at position 2? Therefore, we cannot have R at position 2? So if the word has two R's? The second R can't be at position 2? But it could be at position 1? Then we haven't tested position 1? Now, how about N? The first guess: N was tested at position 4? And got ""-"". Then now we tested position 3? Got ""✓"". Therefore, the secret word has N at position 3? And it cannot be at position 4? Then if it had two N's? Then we need to consider? But again? The positions 1 and 2? Let's look for words that have the pattern: [?, ?, N, O, R]? And the letters are not in the absent list: C, A, E, M, I? Also, note that we have fixed three letters? And two slots? And the words must be English 5-letter words? So we can list possible words fitting the pattern * * N O R? And the first two letters? Excluding C, A, E, M, I? And possibly avoiding duplicates? But we don't rule them out? However, if we don't know, we can try a word without duplicates? Then see? 

Common words ending with NOR: 
- MINOR: we tried? But we got M and I wrong? So it's not ""MINOR""? Because we guessed it? And we had M and I absent? So the word is? So we have to avoid M and I.

Pattern: _ _ N O R? 

Possible words: 
- DONOR: D, O? But O is already at position 4? Then D at position 1? But we haven't tested D? Then:
- HONOR: H O? But then O is at position 4? And we have O at position 4? So H O and then N O R? Actually, H O N O R? Then ""HONOR"" has two O's? So let me spell: H-O-N-O-R? Wait: word is H O N O R? Then positions: 
   1: H? 
   2: O? But O is at position 4? Then we have two O's? Then the O at position 4? Is fixed? Then O at position 2? Then we must be careful? 

Actually, the pattern: 
Position 1: unknown letter (not C, A, E, M, I)
Position 2: unknown letter (not C, A, E, M, I)
Position 3: N
Position 4: O
Position 5: R

So the word is: [L1][L2]NOR

We need to find L1 and L2? 

Available letters: avoid C, A, E, M, I? And from the feedback, we don't have duplicates? But we can try words that might have duplicates? 

Examples:
- ""HONOR"": letters H, O, N, O, R? Then let's see: 
   In the second guess ""MINOR"": 
      We tested O at position 4? Then it was marked ✓? Now, if the secret word ""HONOR"" has O at position 4? Then yes? But what about position 2? O is also at position 2? Then when we tested ""MINOR"": 
         Position 2: I? Absent? So the secret word does not have I? 
         Position 4: O? Correct? 
      But we did not test the O at position 2? So we don't know? 
      O is present? Definitely? Then for duplicate O? How the feedback would appear? 
      Let me simulate: 
        Secret: H O N O R
        Guess MINOR: M (x) I (x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)
        But what about the first O? We didn't test? But the feedback only marks the actual matches? And the duplicate? If the secret word has two O's? Then we tested only one O? The one at position 4? Then we got ✓? Then if we had tested an O elsewhere? It would show '-'? But we didn't? So we have no feedback about the second O? 
      However, the secret word ""HONOR"" has O at position 2? And we have not tested position 2? Also, we know the first guess ""CRANE"": 
        We did not test O? So O is possible? 
      Therefore, ""HONOR"" is a candidate? 

Similarly, ""DONOR"": D, O, N, O, R? Similarly? 
But also, ""MINOR"" we tried? 

Let's list possible words? 
- DONOR: D O N O R? Pattern: D, O, N, O, R -> positions: 
   1: D
   2: O -> then O at position 2? But we have O at position 4? Then duplicate O? 
   3: N
   4: O
   5: R

But in our feedback? We haven't tested O in position 2? So we don't know? 

Another candidate: ""HONOR"": H O? Same? 

Also, ""SONOR"": I don't know? SONOR? Not common? 

Other words? 
- ""FJORD"": F J O R D? Wait? Pattern: F J O R D -> no? The word must end with NOR? So position 3 must be N? Then ""FJORD"" is F J O R D? Then position 3 is O? Not N? Skip? 

Wait: the pattern [letter][letter]NOR? For example:
- _ _ N O R

Possible words:
- DONOR 
- HONOR 
- TONOR? Not common? 
- BONOR? Not common?
- JUNOR? Not a word? 
- Only a few? 

What about the word ""MANOR""? But M? We tested M and got absent? So ""MANOR"" has M? Skip? 

Similarly, ""MINOR"" we tried? 

What about ""PENOR""? Not a word? 

Alternatively, ""SENOR""? But it has E? And we know E is absent? Skip? 

Another: ""TENOR"": T E N O R -> E is absent? Skip? 

So the common words? 
- ""HONOR"" and ""DONOR""? 

Also, ""CONOR"": is a name? Not common word? 
And ""GONOR""? Not a word? 

Also, ""RANOR""? Not? 

So let's consider ""HONOR"" and ""DONOR"". 

But note: we haven't tested H, D? So we can choose a word that covers possible letters? 

But also, note that in ""HONOR"": 
   1: H
   2: O

In ""DONOR"": 
   1: D
   2: O

Both have O at position 2? 

But O is already fixed at position 4? Then if the secret word has O at position 2? That would be a duplicate O? 

Now, how about if we avoid duplicate? That would be easier? 

Another possibility: ""WONOR""? Not a word? 

Or ""LOR"": ...? 

Why not ""THORN""? But THORN: T H O R N -> pattern must end with NOR? Position 3: O? But we need position 3: N? Skip? 

Alternatively, we can try to think of words? 

Another possibility: ""MAYOR"" doesn't fit? 

Or ""STORE"" doesn't fit? 

Actually, the pattern is fixed? So we have limited words? 

Also, we can check the dictionary? But we need to guess? 

So let's try ""DONOR""? But ""DONOR"" is D O N O R? Then duplicate O? We don't know? 

Similarly, ""HONOR"" is H O N O R? Duplicate O? 

But wait: in the second guess, we tested an O? Only at position 4? And got ✓? So we know O is at position 4? But if the word has an O at position 2? Then we haven't tested it? So we don't know? 

Therefore, we should try a word that does not include O at position 2? For example, we can try a word that has different letters? But we don't have many choices? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests other vowels? Since we know A, E, I are absent? So vowels must be? U or Y? Or O again? Wait? O we tried? 

So let's try a candidate? Or try more information? 

Since we have only two tries to get more information? Actually, we have more guesses? But we cannot guess directly? Because we don't know the first two letters? 

But we can choose to try a word that includes likely letters? 

Another candidate: ""JUNOR""? Not a word? 

What about ""NYMPH"" doesn't fit? 

Actually, the pattern? We have * * N O R? Why not think of: 
- First letter: could be B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, S, T, W, Y,... 
- Second letter: could be? Not vowel? Since vowels: A, E, I are out? Then vowels: O, U? Or Y? 

But we know O is present? But we don't know if duplicate? 

Now, let's try to use a word that contains letters that are likely? 

Alternatively? Since we have three letters fixed? And only two unknowns? And at this point? We can try to guess the entire word? 

So possible words? 
- ""HONOR"": H and O at position 1 and 2? 
   But note: at position 2: O? That is? Duplicate O? 
   Now, the first guess was ""CRANE"", which had no O? So we didn't get feedback? 
   The second guess was ""MINOR"": 
        Position 2: I? Absent? So the secret word does not have I? 
        Position 4: O? Correct? 
   But we didn't test position 2? So we don't know? 

Similarly, ""DONOR"" is D O at positions 1-2? 

Another word? ""LYNOR""? Not? 

Or ""SYNOR""? Not? 

Maybe we forgot? ""MINOR"" we tried? 

Or ""THNOR""? No? 

So it seems ""HONOR"" and ""DONOR"" are the candidates? 

But note: ""BONUS"" doesn't fit? 

What about ""BOARD""? Doesn't fit? 

So we must choose one? 

But we have a third guess? And we can get more information? 

Let's try to use a guess that eliminates possibilities? 

For example? Try a word that tests H and D? But how? 

Example: Guess ""DOUGH"": but not ending with NOR? 

But we need a valid English word? 

We can try a word that has H or D? But the pattern? 

Alternatively, we can break the pattern? Since we know positions 3,4,5 are fixed? But we don't know for positions 1 and 2? We can try a word that does not start with * * N O R? But to test letters? 

Example: Guess ""PLUSH""? But it doesn't have N,O,R? Then we get feedback on other letters? But we want to guess? 

But we want to use a word that tests common letters? 

But we have? We know the secret word ends with ""NOR""? 

So let's try ""STUNK""? But k is random? 

But better? We can try to include the fixed letters? So that we don't waste? 

For instance? Make a guess that has the fixed letters (NOR) and two new letters? But the fixed letters will be forced to positions 3,4,5? But we cannot change them? 

So for positions 3,4,5: must be N, O, R? 

Then we need to choose letters for positions 1 and 2? 

But we haven't been able to determine them? 

Alternatively? We can try to use a word that has the pattern? But tests letters? 

But since we don't know the first two? Let's try ""HONOR""? Or ""DONOR""? 

But we have six guesses? We can try ""DONOR"": to test? 

If we guess ""DONOR"": 
- Then if the secret word is ""HONOR"": 
    Feedback: 
         D: absent? Because it is H? 
         O: at position 2? But the secret word has O at position 4? Then O at position 2? We tested? We have O at position 2? Then we have duplicate? So:
         Position 1: D? absent? 
         Position 2: O? present? but not correct? Because if the word is ""HONOR"", then position 2: O? Which is present? But it's a duplicate? Then the feedback would show: 
             D: x 
             O: - ? (because O is present? But position 2? The O at position 2? The secret word has O at position 4? So not at position 2? Hence the O at position 2? Would get ""-"" meaning present? But not correct? 
         Then position 3: N? ✓
         position 4: O? ✓
         position 5: R? ✓
          
         So D(x) O(-) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)

But this tells us that O is present? And we know? But at the same time? We see that D is absent? 

Then we know the word must have H? And O not at position 2? Then we go to ""HONOR""? 

But if the word is ""DONOR"": 
      D: correct? 
      O at position 2? Correct? 
      Then feedback: D(✓) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) 
   But wait: the word ""DONOR"": D O N O R? 
        Position 1: D -> ✓? 
        Position 2: O -> ✓? 
        Position 3: N -> ✓? 
        Position 4: O -> ✓? 
        Position 5: R -> ✓? 
   Then solved? 

Therefore, by guessing ""DONOR"", we can win? Or get feedback? 

But we have only three more guesses? So we can try? 

But let's consider? The secret word might be something else? Like ""HONOR""? Then if we guess ""DONOR"", we get: D(x) O(-) N(✓) O(?) ... wait? Actually, we have two O's? The feedback might be tricky? 

How does feedback handle duplicate letters in Wordle? 
- In official Wordle rules: 
   For duplicate letters in the guess? 
   If the secret word has duplicate letters? 
   Let's simulate:
   Secret word: H O N O R? 
   Guess: D O N O R? 
   Position by position:
       1: D? Absent? -> x
       2: O? Present? But in the secret word: the first O is at position 2? Then if we compare? Actually, it should not show? Wait: the secret word has O at position 4? And also at position 2? Then when we test O at position 2? It's correct? Because ""HONOR"" has O at position 2? Then we should get ✓ for position 2? 

Correction: 
   Secret word: H O N O R? 
   Guess: D O N O R? 
        Position 1: D vs H? Not match? 
        Position 2: O vs O? Match? ✓
        Position 3: N vs N? ✓
        Position 4: O vs O? ✓
        Position 5: R vs R? ✓
        So D(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)

But wait? Then ""DONOR"" is guessed? Then we lose? Since the secret word is ""HONOR""? Actually? The feedback for ""DONOR""? Would be:
         D: x? Because it is D? Then no? The secret word is ""HONOR""? Then D is absent? 
         Then O: at position 2? The secret word ""HONOR"" has O at position 2? So ✓? 
         Then we get: D(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) 

But wait: the secret word has O at position 2 and position 4? At position 4? The guess has O at position 4? So match? ✓? 
Therefore, the feedback would be: 
   Position 1: D? x 
   Position 2: O? ✓ 
   Position 3: N? ✓ 
   Position 4: O? ✓ (since secret has O at position 4)
   Position 5: R? ✓ 

But in the guess ""DONOR"": 
   It has two O's? The first O is at position 2? And we got ✓? 
   The second O? At position 4? And we got ✓? 
   So correct feedback? 

Now, back? The secret word ends with NOR? Fixed? 
Then with the feedback? We see positions 3,4,5 are ✓? So we know? 
But positions 1 and 2? In this case? 
   Position 2: O? ✓? So we know O is at position 2? 
   And position 1: D? x? Then the secret word has? Position 1: not D? Is present? But we don't know? 

Let me think? The secret word has O at position 2? And NOR? Then what? 

So after guessing ""DONOR"": 
   If the secret word is ""HONOR"": 
        Feedback: 
           1: D (x) 
           2: O (✓) 
           3: N (✓) 
           4: O (✓) 
           5: R (✓) 
        Then we know the secret word has the pattern: [x?] O N O R? But position 1 is not D? Then it must be H? 

   And if the secret word is ""DONOR"": 
        1: D (✓) 
        2: O (✓) 
        3: N (✓)
        4: O (✓) 
        5: R (✓) 
        Solved? 

   But if there are other words? Like ""BONOR""? We don't know? 

So it provides useful information? 

But we want to guess in this turn? 

Alternatively, we can try ""HONOR""? 
   If secret is ""HONOR"": 
        H(✓) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)? 
   If secret is ""DONOR"": 
        H(x) O(✓) O(✓) ... etc? 

But the best? Since we have limited words? But we don't know? 

But in the context? Not many words? 

Another word? ""THNOR""? Not? 

Or ""PANDOR""? But 6 letters? 

So let's try ""DONOR"".

But note: we have not tried D? And we know from previous feedback that the letter D has not been tested? So no conflict? 

But we can also consider the first guess? Which had no effect? 

Let me choose ""DONOR""? Because it might solve? Or give enough info? 

Since we are at guess 3? We have only 6 tries? 

But note: the other candidate is ""HONOR"". It might be? 

But let's not gamble? We can guess ""DONOR"", then if not? Next guess? 

However, there might be another word? Like ""RENOR""? But E is out? 

Or ""MANOR""? But M out? 

So only two? So yes? 

Let us choose ""DONOR"". 

So next guess: ""DONOR""

### Feedback Analysis from Previous Guesses:

1. **Guess 1: CRANE**  
   - C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
     - Absent: C, A, E  
     - Present: R, N  
     - Positions: R not at position 2, N not at position 4.  

2. **Guess 2: MINOR**  
   - M(x), I(x), N(✓), O(✓), R(✓)  
     - Absent: M, I  
     - Correct positions:  
       - Position 3 = N  
       - Position 4 = O  
       - Position 5 = R  
     - Secret word structure: `[?][?]NOR`  

### Deductions:
- **Letters must be included**: 
  - R (position 5 confirmed), N (position 3 confirmed), O (position 4 confirmed).  
- **Letters excluded**: C, A, E, M, I.  
- **Remaining positions**: Positions 1 and 2 are unknown.  
- **Possible words**: The secret word ends with `NOR`. Candidates include:  
  - `DONOR`: D O N O R  
  - `HONOR`: H O N O R  
  - Both are valid English words fitting the pattern.  

### Strategy:
- Guess **DONOR** to test if `D` and `O` (at position 2) are present/correct.  
  - If `DONOR` is correct (all ✓), the game ends.  
  - If not, feedback will clarify:  
    - Position 1: If `D` is absent (x), `HONOR` becomes likely.  
    - Position 2: `O` may be confirmed (✓) or misplaced (-), but `HONOR` would be consistent.  
- `D` and `H` are untested letters that maximize information for the next guess if needed.

<guess>donor</guess>",donor,"We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: CRANE**
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, but not in position 2 (-)
- A: absent (x)
- N: present, but not in position 4 (-)
- E: absent (x)

So, the secret word contains R and N, but not C, A, or E.

**Guess 2: MINOR**
- M: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- N: correct position (position 3)! (✓)
- O: correct position (position 4)! (✓)
- R: correct position (position 5)! (✓)

Therefore, we know:
- N is in position 3.
- O is in position 4.
- R is in position 5.
- The letters M and I are absent.

So the secret word has:
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: R
- And from guess 1, R is in the word (now confirmed in position 5) and N is in the word (confirmed in position 3). Also, no C, A, E, M, or I.

Since we have three letters fixed: [?, ?, N, O, R]

We need to find the first two letters. We know the first two are not C, A, E, M, I, and they cannot be R (since R is at the end? But note: we have R at position 5 only; R might be elsewhere? Actually, the feedback from the first guess: R was misplaced, but now we have R at position 5, so it must be that R is only at position 5? But wait: the secret word might have two R's? However, we don't know. But in feedback, we only know that there is at least one R. Since we had R at position 2 in the first guess which was wrong, now R at position 5 is correct. So if there were two R's, then the feedback would have shown two indicators? But in the first guess, we had only one R (which was at position 2) and got a ""-"", meaning R is present but not at that position. Now at position 5 we have a ""✓"". So if the word had two R's, then in the first guess, we got one ""-"" for R? But we don't have extra feedback. Actually, Wordle-style games usually show when a letter is repeated: if the guess has two identical letters and the secret word has two, then both would be marked appropriately. But in the first guess ""CRANE"" only has one R? So we don't know if there are two R's? Actually, we only know that if we try two R's and the feedback shows two marks. Currently, we haven't tried a word with two R's? So we can't rule out duplicate R's? Wait, the secret word is ""N O R"" at positions 3,4,5? Then positions 1 and 2 are not R? Because if there were a duplicate R? Actually, we haven't encountered any feedback that requires duplicate R's? So we can proceed without that? But we must be cautious. Alternatively, since R is in position 5, and we know it wasn't in position 2 (from first guess) and now we have it in position 5? Then positions 1 and 2 could be any letter except the ones we know? Wait: but if the secret word had an R at position 1, then we would have: at position 5 also? Then we would have two R's? But in the feedback for the first guess, we only saw one R? Because we only had one R? So: the secret word must have at least one R? But it could have two? However, since in ""MINOR"" we have R at position 5 and got a ""✓"", and in ""CRANE"" we got a ""-"" for R (meaning it's present), so that R must have been accounted for? Unless the two identical letters? Actually, we haven't eliminated the possibility? But let's see: if the secret word had two R's? Then we haven't encountered any conflict? But for simplicity, let's assume for now that we haven't tried a duplicate? So we cannot be certain? However, note that the first guess ""CRANE"" did not have R at position 5? So we wouldn't have gotten feedback about position 5? That R might be there? Wait: in the first guess, we only tested R at position 2? So it could have been at position 5? Then we get the ""-"" for R? Which doesn't tell us which R? Actually, no: the secret word has R at position 5? So when we tested R at position 2, it was not correct? But that R exists at position 5? So we show a ""-"" for the R? Because the letter R is present? But we don't specify which one? Wait: no duplication? Then only one R? Therefore, there is exactly one R at position 5? Similarly, for N? How about duplicates for N? The first guess: N was in position 4? It was misplaced? Then now we tested N in position 3? Correct? So the secret word has exactly one N? Because if we had two N's? Then in the first guess, we only got one ""-"" for N? Meaning one of the N's? But now we have N at position 3? Then we got a ""✓"" for position 3? Then the other N? But we didn't test? So we can't know? But in the second guess, we tested only one N? So we got one ""✓"". Therefore, we don't know? However, the word is 5 letters? And we have positions 3,4,5 fixed? So we only have two positions left? So if the word had two R's? And we have R at position 5? Then position 1 or 2 must be R? Similarly? But we have a word ending with R? Like ""??NOR"". Then if we had two R's? Then the letters would be R in positions 1 or 2? But let's see the feedback from the first guess? We have R at position 2? And got a ""-"", meaning that R is present? Because we matched? But wait: if the word has R at position 2? Then we would have a ""✓"" at position 2? But we didn't? So R is not at position 2? Therefore, if the word had two R's? One at position 5 and one at position 2? Then the R at position 5 was not tested? But when we tested position 2? The R at position 2? Then feedback would show ""✓"" if R is at position 2? Or ""-"" if not? But we tested R at position 2 and got ""-"", so the secret word does not have R at position 2? Therefore, we cannot have R at position 2? So if the word has two R's? The second R can't be at position 2? But it could be at position 1? Then we haven't tested position 1? Now, how about N? The first guess: N was tested at position 4? And got ""-"". Then now we tested position 3? Got ""✓"". Therefore, the secret word has N at position 3? And it cannot be at position 4? Then if it had two N's? Then we need to consider? But again? The positions 1 and 2? Let's look for words that have the pattern: [?, ?, N, O, R]? And the letters are not in the absent list: C, A, E, M, I? Also, note that we have fixed three letters? And two slots? And the words must be English 5-letter words? So we can list possible words fitting the pattern * * N O R? And the first two letters? Excluding C, A, E, M, I? And possibly avoiding duplicates? But we don't rule them out? However, if we don't know, we can try a word without duplicates? Then see? 

Common words ending with NOR: 
- MINOR: we tried? But we got M and I wrong? So it's not ""MINOR""? Because we guessed it? And we had M and I absent? So the word is? So we have to avoid M and I.

Pattern: _ _ N O R? 

Possible words: 
- DONOR: D, O? But O is already at position 4? Then D at position 1? But we haven't tested D? Then:
- HONOR: H O? But then O is at position 4? And we have O at position 4? So H O and then N O R? Actually, H O N O R? Then ""HONOR"" has two O's? So let me spell: H-O-N-O-R? Wait: word is H O N O R? Then positions: 
   1: H? 
   2: O? But O is at position 4? Then we have two O's? Then the O at position 4? Is fixed? Then O at position 2? Then we must be careful? 

Actually, the pattern: 
Position 1: unknown letter (not C, A, E, M, I)
Position 2: unknown letter (not C, A, E, M, I)
Position 3: N
Position 4: O
Position 5: R

So the word is: [L1][L2]NOR

We need to find L1 and L2? 

Available letters: avoid C, A, E, M, I? And from the feedback, we don't have duplicates? But we can try words that might have duplicates? 

Examples:
- ""HONOR"": letters H, O, N, O, R? Then let's see: 
   In the second guess ""MINOR"": 
      We tested O at position 4? Then it was marked ✓? Now, if the secret word ""HONOR"" has O at position 4? Then yes? But what about position 2? O is also at position 2? Then when we tested ""MINOR"": 
         Position 2: I? Absent? So the secret word does not have I? 
         Position 4: O? Correct? 
      But we did not test the O at position 2? So we don't know? 
      O is present? Definitely? Then for duplicate O? How the feedback would appear? 
      Let me simulate: 
        Secret: H O N O R
        Guess MINOR: M (x) I (x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)
        But what about the first O? We didn't test? But the feedback only marks the actual matches? And the duplicate? If the secret word has two O's? Then we tested only one O? The one at position 4? Then we got ✓? Then if we had tested an O elsewhere? It would show '-'? But we didn't? So we have no feedback about the second O? 
      However, the secret word ""HONOR"" has O at position 2? And we have not tested position 2? Also, we know the first guess ""CRANE"": 
        We did not test O? So O is possible? 
      Therefore, ""HONOR"" is a candidate? 

Similarly, ""DONOR"": D, O, N, O, R? Similarly? 
But also, ""MINOR"" we tried? 

Let's list possible words? 
- DONOR: D O N O R? Pattern: D, O, N, O, R -> positions: 
   1: D
   2: O -> then O at position 2? But we have O at position 4? Then duplicate O? 
   3: N
   4: O
   5: R

But in our feedback? We haven't tested O in position 2? So we don't know? 

Another candidate: ""HONOR"": H O? Same? 

Also, ""SONOR"": I don't know? SONOR? Not common? 

Other words? 
- ""FJORD"": F J O R D? Wait? Pattern: F J O R D -> no? The word must end with NOR? So position 3 must be N? Then ""FJORD"" is F J O R D? Then position 3 is O? Not N? Skip? 

Wait: the pattern [letter][letter]NOR? For example:
- _ _ N O R

Possible words:
- DONOR 
- HONOR 
- TONOR? Not common? 
- BONOR? Not common?
- JUNOR? Not a word? 
- Only a few? 

What about the word ""MANOR""? But M? We tested M and got absent? So ""MANOR"" has M? Skip? 

Similarly, ""MINOR"" we tried? 

What about ""PENOR""? Not a word? 

Alternatively, ""SENOR""? But it has E? And we know E is absent? Skip? 

Another: ""TENOR"": T E N O R -> E is absent? Skip? 

So the common words? 
- ""HONOR"" and ""DONOR""? 

Also, ""CONOR"": is a name? Not common word? 
And ""GONOR""? Not a word? 

Also, ""RANOR""? Not? 

So let's consider ""HONOR"" and ""DONOR"". 

But note: we haven't tested H, D? So we can choose a word that covers possible letters? 

But also, note that in ""HONOR"": 
   1: H
   2: O

In ""DONOR"": 
   1: D
   2: O

Both have O at position 2? 

But O is already fixed at position 4? Then if the secret word has O at position 2? That would be a duplicate O? 

Now, how about if we avoid duplicate? That would be easier? 

Another possibility: ""WONOR""? Not a word? 

Or ""LOR"": ...? 

Why not ""THORN""? But THORN: T H O R N -> pattern must end with NOR? Position 3: O? But we need position 3: N? Skip? 

Alternatively, we can try to think of words? 

Another possibility: ""MAYOR"" doesn't fit? 

Or ""STORE"" doesn't fit? 

Actually, the pattern is fixed? So we have limited words? 

Also, we can check the dictionary? But we need to guess? 

So let's try ""DONOR""? But ""DONOR"" is D O N O R? Then duplicate O? We don't know? 

Similarly, ""HONOR"" is H O N O R? Duplicate O? 

But wait: in the second guess, we tested an O? Only at position 4? And got ✓? So we know O is at position 4? But if the word has an O at position 2? Then we haven't tested it? So we don't know? 

Therefore, we should try a word that does not include O at position 2? For example, we can try a word that has different letters? But we don't have many choices? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests other vowels? Since we know A, E, I are absent? So vowels must be? U or Y? Or O again? Wait? O we tried? 

So let's try a candidate? Or try more information? 

Since we have only two tries to get more information? Actually, we have more guesses? But we cannot guess directly? Because we don't know the first two letters? 

But we can choose to try a word that includes likely letters? 

Another candidate: ""JUNOR""? Not a word? 

What about ""NYMPH"" doesn't fit? 

Actually, the pattern? We have * * N O R? Why not think of: 
- First letter: could be B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, S, T, W, Y,... 
- Second letter: could be? Not vowel? Since vowels: A, E, I are out? Then vowels: O, U? Or Y? 

But we know O is present? But we don't know if duplicate? 

Now, let's try to use a word that contains letters that are likely? 

Alternatively? Since we have three letters fixed? And only two unknowns? And at this point? We can try to guess the entire word? 

So possible words? 
- ""HONOR"": H and O at position 1 and 2? 
   But note: at position 2: O? That is? Duplicate O? 
   Now, the first guess was ""CRANE"", which had no O? So we didn't get feedback? 
   The second guess was ""MINOR"": 
        Position 2: I? Absent? So the secret word does not have I? 
        Position 4: O? Correct? 
   But we didn't test position 2? So we don't know? 

Similarly, ""DONOR"" is D O at positions 1-2? 

Another word? ""LYNOR""? Not? 

Or ""SYNOR""? Not? 

Maybe we forgot? ""MINOR"" we tried? 

Or ""THNOR""? No? 

So it seems ""HONOR"" and ""DONOR"" are the candidates? 

But note: ""BONUS"" doesn't fit? 

What about ""BOARD""? Doesn't fit? 

So we must choose one? 

But we have a third guess? And we can get more information? 

Let's try to use a guess that eliminates possibilities? 

For example? Try a word that tests H and D? But how? 

Example: Guess ""DOUGH"": but not ending with NOR? 

But we need a valid English word? 

We can try a word that has H or D? But the pattern? 

Alternatively, we can break the pattern? Since we know positions 3,4,5 are fixed? But we don't know for positions 1 and 2? We can try a word that does not start with * * N O R? But to test letters? 

Example: Guess ""PLUSH""? But it doesn't have N,O,R? Then we get feedback on other letters? But we want to guess? 

But we want to use a word that tests common letters? 

But we have? We know the secret word ends with ""NOR""? 

So let's try ""STUNK""? But k is random? 

But better? We can try to include the fixed letters? So that we don't waste? 

For instance? Make a guess that has the fixed letters (NOR) and two new letters? But the fixed letters will be forced to positions 3,4,5? But we cannot change them? 

So for positions 3,4,5: must be N, O, R? 

Then we need to choose letters for positions 1 and 2? 

But we haven't been able to determine them? 

Alternatively? We can try to use a word that has the pattern? But tests letters? 

But since we don't know the first two? Let's try ""HONOR""? Or ""DONOR""? 

But we have six guesses? We can try ""DONOR"": to test? 

If we guess ""DONOR"": 
- Then if the secret word is ""HONOR"": 
    Feedback: 
         D: absent? Because it is H? 
         O: at position 2? But the secret word has O at position 4? Then O at position 2? We tested? We have O at position 2? Then we have duplicate? So:
         Position 1: D? absent? 
         Position 2: O? present? but not correct? Because if the word is ""HONOR"", then position 2: O? Which is present? But it's a duplicate? Then the feedback would show: 
             D: x 
             O: - ? (because O is present? But position 2? The O at position 2? The secret word has O at position 4? So not at position 2? Hence the O at position 2? Would get ""-"" meaning present? But not correct? 
         Then position 3: N? ✓
         position 4: O? ✓
         position 5: R? ✓
          
         So D(x) O(-) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)

But this tells us that O is present? And we know? But at the same time? We see that D is absent? 

Then we know the word must have H? And O not at position 2? Then we go to ""HONOR""? 

But if the word is ""DONOR"": 
      D: correct? 
      O at position 2? Correct? 
      Then feedback: D(✓) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) 
   But wait: the word ""DONOR"": D O N O R? 
        Position 1: D -> ✓? 
        Position 2: O -> ✓? 
        Position 3: N -> ✓? 
        Position 4: O -> ✓? 
        Position 5: R -> ✓? 
   Then solved? 

Therefore, by guessing ""DONOR"", we can win? Or get feedback? 

But we have only three more guesses? So we can try? 

But let's consider? The secret word might be something else? Like ""HONOR""? Then if we guess ""DONOR"", we get: D(x) O(-) N(✓) O(?) ... wait? Actually, we have two O's? The feedback might be tricky? 

How does feedback handle duplicate letters in Wordle? 
- In official Wordle rules: 
   For duplicate letters in the guess? 
   If the secret word has duplicate letters? 
   Let's simulate:
   Secret word: H O N O R? 
   Guess: D O N O R? 
   Position by position:
       1: D? Absent? -> x
       2: O? Present? But in the secret word: the first O is at position 2? Then if we compare? Actually, it should not show? Wait: the secret word has O at position 4? And also at position 2? Then when we test O at position 2? It's correct? Because ""HONOR"" has O at position 2? Then we should get ✓ for position 2? 

Correction: 
   Secret word: H O N O R? 
   Guess: D O N O R? 
        Position 1: D vs H? Not match? 
        Position 2: O vs O? Match? ✓
        Position 3: N vs N? ✓
        Position 4: O vs O? ✓
        Position 5: R vs R? ✓
        So D(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)

But wait? Then ""DONOR"" is guessed? Then we lose? Since the secret word is ""HONOR""? Actually? The feedback for ""DONOR""? Would be:
         D: x? Because it is D? Then no? The secret word is ""HONOR""? Then D is absent? 
         Then O: at position 2? The secret word ""HONOR"" has O at position 2? So ✓? 
         Then we get: D(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) 

But wait: the secret word has O at position 2 and position 4? At position 4? The guess has O at position 4? So match? ✓? 
Therefore, the feedback would be: 
   Position 1: D? x 
   Position 2: O? ✓ 
   Position 3: N? ✓ 
   Position 4: O? ✓ (since secret has O at position 4)
   Position 5: R? ✓ 

But in the guess ""DONOR"": 
   It has two O's? The first O is at position 2? And we got ✓? 
   The second O? At position 4? And we got ✓? 
   So correct feedback? 

Now, back? The secret word ends with NOR? Fixed? 
Then with the feedback? We see positions 3,4,5 are ✓? So we know? 
But positions 1 and 2? In this case? 
   Position 2: O? ✓? So we know O is at position 2? 
   And position 1: D? x? Then the secret word has? Position 1: not D? Is present? But we don't know? 

Let me think? The secret word has O at position 2? And NOR? Then what? 

So after guessing ""DONOR"": 
   If the secret word is ""HONOR"": 
        Feedback: 
           1: D (x) 
           2: O (✓) 
           3: N (✓) 
           4: O (✓) 
           5: R (✓) 
        Then we know the secret word has the pattern: [x?] O N O R? But position 1 is not D? Then it must be H? 

   And if the secret word is ""DONOR"": 
        1: D (✓) 
        2: O (✓) 
        3: N (✓)
        4: O (✓) 
        5: R (✓) 
        Solved? 

   But if there are other words? Like ""BONOR""? We don't know? 

So it provides useful information? 

But we want to guess in this turn? 

Alternatively, we can try ""HONOR""? 
   If secret is ""HONOR"": 
        H(✓) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)? 
   If secret is ""DONOR"": 
        H(x) O(✓) O(✓) ... etc? 

But the best? Since we have limited words? But we don't know? 

But in the context? Not many words? 

Another word? ""THNOR""? Not? 

Or ""PANDOR""? But 6 letters? 

So let's try ""DONOR"".

But note: we have not tried D? And we know from previous feedback that the letter D has not been tested? So no conflict? 

But we can also consider the first guess? Which had no effect? 

Let me choose ""DONOR""? Because it might solve? Or give enough info? 

Since we are at guess 3? We have only 6 tries? 

But note: the other candidate is ""HONOR"". It might be? 

But let's not gamble? We can guess ""DONOR"", then if not? Next guess? 

However, there might be another word? Like ""RENOR""? But E is out? 

Or ""MANOR""? But M out? 

So only two? So yes? 

Let us choose ""DONOR"". 

So next guess: ""DONOR""

<guess>donor</guess>### Feedback Analysis from Previous Guesses:

1. **Guess 1: CRANE**  
   - C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
     - Absent: C, A, E  
     - Present: R, N  
     - Positions: R not at position 2, N not at position 4.  

2. **Guess 2: MINOR**  
   - M(x), I(x), N(✓), O(✓), R(✓)  
     - Absent: M, I  
     - Correct positions:  
       - Position 3 = N  
       - Position 4 = O  
       - Position 5 = R  
     - Secret word structure: `[?][?]NOR`  

### Deductions:
- **Letters must be included**: 
  - R (position 5 confirmed), N (position 3 confirmed), O (position 4 confirmed).  
- **Letters excluded**: C, A, E, M, I.  
- **Remaining positions**: Positions 1 and 2 are unknown.  
- **Possible words**: The secret word ends with `NOR`. Candidates include:  
  - `DONOR`: D O N O R  
  - `HONOR`: H O N O R  
  - Both are valid English words fitting the pattern.  

### Strategy:
- Guess **DONOR** to test if `D` and `O` (at position 2) are present/correct.  
  - If `DONOR` is correct (all ✓), the game ends.  
  - If not, feedback will clarify:  
    - Position 1: If `D` is absent (x), `HONOR` becomes likely.  
    - Position 2: `O` may be confirmed (✓) or misplaced (-), but `HONOR` would be consistent.  
- `D` and `H` are untested letters that maximize information for the next guess if needed.",Guess 3: donor -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,honor,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
 - The letters are all distinct.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the word.
 - R is in the word but not in the correct position (so R is somewhere else).
 - A is not in the word.
 - N is in the word but not in the correct position.
 - E is not in the word.

 Therefore, the secret word contains R and N, but not C, A, or E.

 Also, note that R and N are not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"". Since ""CRANE"" has R as the 2nd letter and N as the 4th letter, the secret word has R not in position 2 and N not in position 4.

 Now, for our next guess, we should:
 1. Include R and N (since we know they are in the word).
 2. Avoid C, A, E.
 3. Use new letters that are common to gather more information.

 We also note the positions: 
   Position 1: not C (and not R since R was in position 2 originally? But wait, R is not at position 2 but might be at position 1? Actually, in ""CRANE"", R was in position 2 but we know it's not correct. We don't know if position 1 is ruled out for R? Actually, no: the feedback doesn't tell us that R can't be in position 1, only that it isn't in position 2. Similarly, N isn't in position 4 but could be elsewhere.

 However, note that the feedback for R was '-' meaning it is present but not at position 2. Similarly, N is present but not at position 4.

 So in our next guess, we can try to place R and N in different positions.

 Let's think of words that contain R and N, and without C, A, E.

 Common letters left: we have many consonants and vowels. We know the word doesn't have A or E (vowels are important). So the vowels must be from I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

 Given that, let's try to use another vowel: O or U or I.

 Also, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, E.

 Let's try to guess a word that includes R and N, and preferably with common letters we haven't tried.

 Possibilities: words like ""BORNS"", ""HORNS"", ""TORNS"" but note we need 5 letters.

 However, we must be cautious: we also know that R was in position 2 in our first guess and it was wrong, so in the new word we should put R in a different position. Similarly for N: it was in position 4 and wrong, so we put N in a different position.

 Let's brainstorm some words:
 - Option: ""IRONY"" - but I and Y are new, and O is new. However, note that we don't know if Y is allowed? The rules say English word, yes. But let's check the structure: ""IRONY"" would place R in the second position again? Actually, ""IRONY"": I _ R _ at position 1, R at position 2? But we have R in our word and we know it wasn't in position 2 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback only said that R is in the word but not in position 2. We can still try R at position 2? Why not? Actually, we can't? Wait: if we put R in position 2 again, we might get the same feedback? But we know the secret word doesn't have R at position 2. So we should avoid putting R at position 2 again? Actually, the game allows us to do so, but it would not give new information? So we should avoid.

 So let's avoid position 2 for R and position 4 for N.

 Other options: 
 - ""HORNS"": H O R N S -> R is at position 3 and N at position 4. That moves R and N? We know that in the secret word, N is not in position 4? So putting N at position 4 would be wasteful? But actually, the feedback we got said that when we had N at position 4, it was present but not correct. So that doesn't prevent the secret word from having N at position 4? Wait, no: the feedback for N was '-' meaning it is present but not at that position. So the secret word has N somewhere else. Therefore, the secret word does NOT have N at position 4. Similarly, R is not at position 2. Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2 and N at position 4.

 Therefore, in ""HORNS"": 
   R is at position 3 (which is not 2 -> allowed) 
   N is at position 4 -> but we know N is NOT in the secret word at position 4? So we should not put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it will be marked as wrong again? It doesn't give new information? So we should avoid placing N at position 4.

 Therefore, choose a word with N not at position 4.

 Another idea: ""RUNNY"" has repeated N? And R at position 1? But we don't want repeated letters unless necessary? And it has U and Y. But also, repeated N may complicate.

 Let me think of a word with R and N, without C, A, E, and without R in position 2 and N in position 4?

 Example words:
 - ""GROIN"": G R O I N -> R is in position 2? Avoid: we know R should not be at position 2? Actually, we can't use position 2 for R? We know the secret word doesn't have R at position 2? So we avoid position 2 for R.
   Therefore, not ""GROIN"".

 - ""PRONG"": P R O N G -> R is in position 2? Avoid.

 - ""STERN"": S T E R N -> but E is in the word? We know E is absent? So no.

 - ""STRIP"": S T R I P -> has no N? But we must have N.

 We need a word that includes at least R and N.

 - ""TRUNK"": T R U N K -> R is at position 2? Skip.

 - ""BLURT"": no N.

 - ""BORNE"": but E is absent? Skip.

 - ""URBAN"": has A? Skip.

 - ""HORNS"" we had: and we avoid N at position 4.

 How about ""HORNY"": H O R N Y -> 
   Positions: 
      H(1) -> new
      O(2) -> new
      R(3) -> not position 2 -> ok
      N(4) -> position 4? But we know N is not in position 4? Then why put it there? We would get a '-' again? So we avoid.

 How about moving N to a different position? Like position 5? 

 Words: ""ROUND"": R O U N D -> 
   R is at position 1: that's not position 2 -> ok.
   N is at position 4 -> we must avoid? Actually, the feedback for N was '-' meaning N is not at position 4? So putting N at position 4 again would be not good? But actually, the secret word has N, but not in position 4. So when we put N at position 4, it should show as '-' (if it's really not there) and that doesn't tell us anything new? So we lose one chance? Therefore, we can do it? But we waste a slot? We are at guess 2, so we want as much info as possible.

 Alternatively, we could put N in a position we haven't tried? Then we can know if it belongs there.

 We have positions: 1, 3, 5 we haven't placed N? Because we tried position 4.

 So let's try a word with R and N, with N not in position 4.

 Example: ""CORNS"" has C? We know C is absent.

 What about ""LORDS""? Doesn't have N? Skip.

 Another: ""MINOR"": M I N O R -> 
   Positions: N at position 3? R at position 5?
   That avoids position 2 for R and position 4 for N? Yes, since:
      M(1), I(2), N(3), O(4), R(5)
   Then R is at position 5? which is new? And N is at position 3? which we haven't tried.

 Also, letters M, I, O are new. And we avoid C, A, E.

 But note: we must make sure we don't use any of the absent letters (C, A, E). This word has M, I, N, O, R -> all new? So it's good? Wait, I is a vowel? Yes.

 So let me select ""MINOR"": 
   We place:
      M: at position 1 (new)
      I: at position 2 (new vowel)
      N: at position 3 (since we know it's not at 4, and 3 is new)
      O: at position 4 (new vowel)
      R: at position 5 (we know it's not at 2? and 5 is new)

 Also, we avoid position 2 for R? Yes: we placed R at position 5.

 Therefore, ""MINOR"" is a valid guess.

 However, note: what if the secret word has N at position 1? Then we haven't tested that? But that's okay? We have two known letters and we are trying new positions.

 Alternatively, we can try ""DINER""? But E? Skip.

 Or ""HINGE""? E? Skip.

 So let's go with ""MINOR"".

 But wait: we know R is in the word? So we are putting it at position 5? That might be right? Or it might not? We'll see.

 Since we don't know the positions, it's worth trying.

 Therefore, the next guess: ""MINOR"".

<guess>minor</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- **C**, **A**, and **E** are **absent**.  
- **R** and **N** are **present** but **misplaced** (not in positions 2 or 4, respectively).  

For the second guess:  
- Must include **R** and **N**, but avoid **C**, **A**, **E**.  
- Use new letters to maximize information.  
- Avoid repeating misplaced positions: **R** cannot be in position 2, **N** cannot be in position 4.  

Chose ""MINOR"" because:  
- Contains **R** (position 5) and **N** (position 3), avoiding invalid positions.  
- Introduces common new letters: **M**, **I**, **O**.  
- Tests vowels **I** and **O**, as **A** and **E** are ruled out.

<guess>minor</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: minor -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: CRANE**
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, but not in position 2 (-)
- A: absent (x)
- N: present, but not in position 4 (-)
- E: absent (x)

So, the secret word contains R and N, but not C, A, or E.

**Guess 2: MINOR**
- M: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- N: correct position (position 3)! (✓)
- O: correct position (position 4)! (✓)
- R: correct position (position 5)! (✓)

Therefore, we know:
- N is in position 3.
- O is in position 4.
- R is in position 5.
- The letters M and I are absent.

So the secret word has:
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: R
- And from guess 1, R is in the word (now confirmed in position 5) and N is in the word (confirmed in position 3). Also, no C, A, E, M, or I.

Since we have three letters fixed: [?, ?, N, O, R]

We need to find the first two letters. We know the first two are not C, A, E, M, I, and they cannot be R (since R is at the end? But note: we have R at position 5 only; R might be elsewhere? Actually, the feedback from the first guess: R was misplaced, but now we have R at position 5, so it must be that R is only at position 5? But wait: the secret word might have two R's? However, we don't know. But in feedback, we only know that there is at least one R. Since we had R at position 2 in the first guess which was wrong, now R at position 5 is correct. So if there were two R's, then the feedback would have shown two indicators? But in the first guess, we had only one R (which was at position 2) and got a ""-"", meaning R is present but not at that position. Now at position 5 we have a ""✓"". So if the word had two R's, then in the first guess, we got one ""-"" for R? But we don't have extra feedback. Actually, Wordle-style games usually show when a letter is repeated: if the guess has two identical letters and the secret word has two, then both would be marked appropriately. But in the first guess ""CRANE"" only has one R? So we don't know if there are two R's? Actually, we only know that if we try two R's and the feedback shows two marks. Currently, we haven't tried a word with two R's? So we can't rule out duplicate R's? Wait, the secret word is ""N O R"" at positions 3,4,5? Then positions 1 and 2 are not R? Because if there were a duplicate R? Actually, we haven't encountered any feedback that requires duplicate R's? So we can proceed without that? But we must be cautious. Alternatively, since R is in position 5, and we know it wasn't in position 2 (from first guess) and now we have it in position 5? Then positions 1 and 2 could be any letter except the ones we know? Wait: but if the secret word had an R at position 1, then we would have: at position 5 also? Then we would have two R's? But in the feedback for the first guess, we only saw one R? Because we only had one R? So: the secret word must have at least one R? But it could have two? However, since in ""MINOR"" we have R at position 5 and got a ""✓"", and in ""CRANE"" we got a ""-"" for R (meaning it's present), so that R must have been accounted for? Unless the two identical letters? Actually, we haven't eliminated the possibility? But let's see: if the secret word had two R's? Then we haven't encountered any conflict? But for simplicity, let's assume for now that we haven't tried a duplicate? So we cannot be certain? However, note that the first guess ""CRANE"" did not have R at position 5? So we wouldn't have gotten feedback about position 5? That R might be there? Wait: in the first guess, we only tested R at position 2? So it could have been at position 5? Then we get the ""-"" for R? Which doesn't tell us which R? Actually, no: the secret word has R at position 5? So when we tested R at position 2, it was not correct? But that R exists at position 5? So we show a ""-"" for the R? Because the letter R is present? But we don't specify which one? Wait: no duplication? Then only one R? Therefore, there is exactly one R at position 5? Similarly, for N? How about duplicates for N? The first guess: N was in position 4? It was misplaced? Then now we tested N in position 3? Correct? So the secret word has exactly one N? Because if we had two N's? Then in the first guess, we only got one ""-"" for N? Meaning one of the N's? But now we have N at position 3? Then we got a ""✓"" for position 3? Then the other N? But we didn't test? So we can't know? But in the second guess, we tested only one N? So we got one ""✓"". Therefore, we don't know? However, the word is 5 letters? And we have positions 3,4,5 fixed? So we only have two positions left? So if the word had two R's? And we have R at position 5? Then position 1 or 2 must be R? Similarly? But we have a word ending with R? Like ""??NOR"". Then if we had two R's? Then the letters would be R in positions 1 or 2? But let's see the feedback from the first guess? We have R at position 2? And got a ""-"", meaning that R is present? Because we matched? But wait: if the word has R at position 2? Then we would have a ""✓"" at position 2? But we didn't? So R is not at position 2? Therefore, if the word had two R's? One at position 5 and one at position 2? Then the R at position 5 was not tested? But when we tested position 2? The R at position 2? Then feedback would show ""✓"" if R is at position 2? Or ""-"" if not? But we tested R at position 2 and got ""-"", so the secret word does not have R at position 2? Therefore, we cannot have R at position 2? So if the word has two R's? The second R can't be at position 2? But it could be at position 1? Then we haven't tested position 1? Now, how about N? The first guess: N was tested at position 4? And got ""-"". Then now we tested position 3? Got ""✓"". Therefore, the secret word has N at position 3? And it cannot be at position 4? Then if it had two N's? Then we need to consider? But again? The positions 1 and 2? Let's look for words that have the pattern: [?, ?, N, O, R]? And the letters are not in the absent list: C, A, E, M, I? Also, note that we have fixed three letters? And two slots? And the words must be English 5-letter words? So we can list possible words fitting the pattern * * N O R? And the first two letters? Excluding C, A, E, M, I? And possibly avoiding duplicates? But we don't rule them out? However, if we don't know, we can try a word without duplicates? Then see? 

Common words ending with NOR: 
- MINOR: we tried? But we got M and I wrong? So it's not ""MINOR""? Because we guessed it? And we had M and I absent? So the word is? So we have to avoid M and I.

Pattern: _ _ N O R? 

Possible words: 
- DONOR: D, O? But O is already at position 4? Then D at position 1? But we haven't tested D? Then:
- HONOR: H O? But then O is at position 4? And we have O at position 4? So H O and then N O R? Actually, H O N O R? Then ""HONOR"" has two O's? So let me spell: H-O-N-O-R? Wait: word is H O N O R? Then positions: 
   1: H? 
   2: O? But O is at position 4? Then we have two O's? Then the O at position 4? Is fixed? Then O at position 2? Then we must be careful? 

Actually, the pattern: 
Position 1: unknown letter (not C, A, E, M, I)
Position 2: unknown letter (not C, A, E, M, I)
Position 3: N
Position 4: O
Position 5: R

So the word is: [L1][L2]NOR

We need to find L1 and L2? 

Available letters: avoid C, A, E, M, I? And from the feedback, we don't have duplicates? But we can try words that might have duplicates? 

Examples:
- ""HONOR"": letters H, O, N, O, R? Then let's see: 
   In the second guess ""MINOR"": 
      We tested O at position 4? Then it was marked ✓? Now, if the secret word ""HONOR"" has O at position 4? Then yes? But what about position 2? O is also at position 2? Then when we tested ""MINOR"": 
         Position 2: I? Absent? So the secret word does not have I? 
         Position 4: O? Correct? 
      But we did not test the O at position 2? So we don't know? 
      O is present? Definitely? Then for duplicate O? How the feedback would appear? 
      Let me simulate: 
        Secret: H O N O R
        Guess MINOR: M (x) I (x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)
        But what about the first O? We didn't test? But the feedback only marks the actual matches? And the duplicate? If the secret word has two O's? Then we tested only one O? The one at position 4? Then we got ✓? Then if we had tested an O elsewhere? It would show '-'? But we didn't? So we have no feedback about the second O? 
      However, the secret word ""HONOR"" has O at position 2? And we have not tested position 2? Also, we know the first guess ""CRANE"": 
        We did not test O? So O is possible? 
      Therefore, ""HONOR"" is a candidate? 

Similarly, ""DONOR"": D, O, N, O, R? Similarly? 
But also, ""MINOR"" we tried? 

Let's list possible words? 
- DONOR: D O N O R? Pattern: D, O, N, O, R -> positions: 
   1: D
   2: O -> then O at position 2? But we have O at position 4? Then duplicate O? 
   3: N
   4: O
   5: R

But in our feedback? We haven't tested O in position 2? So we don't know? 

Another candidate: ""HONOR"": H O? Same? 

Also, ""SONOR"": I don't know? SONOR? Not common? 

Other words? 
- ""FJORD"": F J O R D? Wait? Pattern: F J O R D -> no? The word must end with NOR? So position 3 must be N? Then ""FJORD"" is F J O R D? Then position 3 is O? Not N? Skip? 

Wait: the pattern [letter][letter]NOR? For example:
- _ _ N O R

Possible words:
- DONOR 
- HONOR 
- TONOR? Not common? 
- BONOR? Not common?
- JUNOR? Not a word? 
- Only a few? 

What about the word ""MANOR""? But M? We tested M and got absent? So ""MANOR"" has M? Skip? 

Similarly, ""MINOR"" we tried? 

What about ""PENOR""? Not a word? 

Alternatively, ""SENOR""? But it has E? And we know E is absent? Skip? 

Another: ""TENOR"": T E N O R -> E is absent? Skip? 

So the common words? 
- ""HONOR"" and ""DONOR""? 

Also, ""CONOR"": is a name? Not common word? 
And ""GONOR""? Not a word? 

Also, ""RANOR""? Not? 

So let's consider ""HONOR"" and ""DONOR"". 

But note: we haven't tested H, D? So we can choose a word that covers possible letters? 

But also, note that in ""HONOR"": 
   1: H
   2: O

In ""DONOR"": 
   1: D
   2: O

Both have O at position 2? 

But O is already fixed at position 4? Then if the secret word has O at position 2? That would be a duplicate O? 

Now, how about if we avoid duplicate? That would be easier? 

Another possibility: ""WONOR""? Not a word? 

Or ""LOR"": ...? 

Why not ""THORN""? But THORN: T H O R N -> pattern must end with NOR? Position 3: O? But we need position 3: N? Skip? 

Alternatively, we can try to think of words? 

Another possibility: ""MAYOR"" doesn't fit? 

Or ""STORE"" doesn't fit? 

Actually, the pattern is fixed? So we have limited words? 

Also, we can check the dictionary? But we need to guess? 

So let's try ""DONOR""? But ""DONOR"" is D O N O R? Then duplicate O? We don't know? 

Similarly, ""HONOR"" is H O N O R? Duplicate O? 

But wait: in the second guess, we tested an O? Only at position 4? And got ✓? So we know O is at position 4? But if the word has an O at position 2? Then we haven't tested it? So we don't know? 

Therefore, we should try a word that does not include O at position 2? For example, we can try a word that has different letters? But we don't have many choices? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests other vowels? Since we know A, E, I are absent? So vowels must be? U or Y? Or O again? Wait? O we tried? 

So let's try a candidate? Or try more information? 

Since we have only two tries to get more information? Actually, we have more guesses? But we cannot guess directly? Because we don't know the first two letters? 

But we can choose to try a word that includes likely letters? 

Another candidate: ""JUNOR""? Not a word? 

What about ""NYMPH"" doesn't fit? 

Actually, the pattern? We have * * N O R? Why not think of: 
- First letter: could be B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, S, T, W, Y,... 
- Second letter: could be? Not vowel? Since vowels: A, E, I are out? Then vowels: O, U? Or Y? 

But we know O is present? But we don't know if duplicate? 

Now, let's try to use a word that contains letters that are likely? 

Alternatively? Since we have three letters fixed? And only two unknowns? And at this point? We can try to guess the entire word? 

So possible words? 
- ""HONOR"": H and O at position 1 and 2? 
   But note: at position 2: O? That is? Duplicate O? 
   Now, the first guess was ""CRANE"", which had no O? So we didn't get feedback? 
   The second guess was ""MINOR"": 
        Position 2: I? Absent? So the secret word does not have I? 
        Position 4: O? Correct? 
   But we didn't test position 2? So we don't know? 

Similarly, ""DONOR"" is D O at positions 1-2? 

Another word? ""LYNOR""? Not? 

Or ""SYNOR""? Not? 

Maybe we forgot? ""MINOR"" we tried? 

Or ""THNOR""? No? 

So it seems ""HONOR"" and ""DONOR"" are the candidates? 

But note: ""BONUS"" doesn't fit? 

What about ""BOARD""? Doesn't fit? 

So we must choose one? 

But we have a third guess? And we can get more information? 

Let's try to use a guess that eliminates possibilities? 

For example? Try a word that tests H and D? But how? 

Example: Guess ""DOUGH"": but not ending with NOR? 

But we need a valid English word? 

We can try a word that has H or D? But the pattern? 

Alternatively, we can break the pattern? Since we know positions 3,4,5 are fixed? But we don't know for positions 1 and 2? We can try a word that does not start with * * N O R? But to test letters? 

Example: Guess ""PLUSH""? But it doesn't have N,O,R? Then we get feedback on other letters? But we want to guess? 

But we want to use a word that tests common letters? 

But we have? We know the secret word ends with ""NOR""? 

So let's try ""STUNK""? But k is random? 

But better? We can try to include the fixed letters? So that we don't waste? 

For instance? Make a guess that has the fixed letters (NOR) and two new letters? But the fixed letters will be forced to positions 3,4,5? But we cannot change them? 

So for positions 3,4,5: must be N, O, R? 

Then we need to choose letters for positions 1 and 2? 

But we haven't been able to determine them? 

Alternatively? We can try to use a word that has the pattern? But tests letters? 

But since we don't know the first two? Let's try ""HONOR""? Or ""DONOR""? 

But we have six guesses? We can try ""DONOR"": to test? 

If we guess ""DONOR"": 
- Then if the secret word is ""HONOR"": 
    Feedback: 
         D: absent? Because it is H? 
         O: at position 2? But the secret word has O at position 4? Then O at position 2? We tested? We have O at position 2? Then we have duplicate? So:
         Position 1: D? absent? 
         Position 2: O? present? but not correct? Because if the word is ""HONOR"", then position 2: O? Which is present? But it's a duplicate? Then the feedback would show: 
             D: x 
             O: - ? (because O is present? But position 2? The O at position 2? The secret word has O at position 4? So not at position 2? Hence the O at position 2? Would get ""-"" meaning present? But not correct? 
         Then position 3: N? ✓
         position 4: O? ✓
         position 5: R? ✓
          
         So D(x) O(-) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)

But this tells us that O is present? And we know? But at the same time? We see that D is absent? 

Then we know the word must have H? And O not at position 2? Then we go to ""HONOR""? 

But if the word is ""DONOR"": 
      D: correct? 
      O at position 2? Correct? 
      Then feedback: D(✓) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) 
   But wait: the word ""DONOR"": D O N O R? 
        Position 1: D -> ✓? 
        Position 2: O -> ✓? 
        Position 3: N -> ✓? 
        Position 4: O -> ✓? 
        Position 5: R -> ✓? 
   Then solved? 

Therefore, by guessing ""DONOR"", we can win? Or get feedback? 

But we have only three more guesses? So we can try? 

But let's consider? The secret word might be something else? Like ""HONOR""? Then if we guess ""DONOR"", we get: D(x) O(-) N(✓) O(?) ... wait? Actually, we have two O's? The feedback might be tricky? 

How does feedback handle duplicate letters in Wordle? 
- In official Wordle rules: 
   For duplicate letters in the guess? 
   If the secret word has duplicate letters? 
   Let's simulate:
   Secret word: H O N O R? 
   Guess: D O N O R? 
   Position by position:
       1: D? Absent? -> x
       2: O? Present? But in the secret word: the first O is at position 2? Then if we compare? Actually, it should not show? Wait: the secret word has O at position 4? And also at position 2? Then when we test O at position 2? It's correct? Because ""HONOR"" has O at position 2? Then we should get ✓ for position 2? 

Correction: 
   Secret word: H O N O R? 
   Guess: D O N O R? 
        Position 1: D vs H? Not match? 
        Position 2: O vs O? Match? ✓
        Position 3: N vs N? ✓
        Position 4: O vs O? ✓
        Position 5: R vs R? ✓
        So D(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)

But wait? Then ""DONOR"" is guessed? Then we lose? Since the secret word is ""HONOR""? Actually? The feedback for ""DONOR""? Would be:
         D: x? Because it is D? Then no? The secret word is ""HONOR""? Then D is absent? 
         Then O: at position 2? The secret word ""HONOR"" has O at position 2? So ✓? 
         Then we get: D(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) 

But wait: the secret word has O at position 2 and position 4? At position 4? The guess has O at position 4? So match? ✓? 
Therefore, the feedback would be: 
   Position 1: D? x 
   Position 2: O? ✓ 
   Position 3: N? ✓ 
   Position 4: O? ✓ (since secret has O at position 4)
   Position 5: R? ✓ 

But in the guess ""DONOR"": 
   It has two O's? The first O is at position 2? And we got ✓? 
   The second O? At position 4? And we got ✓? 
   So correct feedback? 

Now, back? The secret word ends with NOR? Fixed? 
Then with the feedback? We see positions 3,4,5 are ✓? So we know? 
But positions 1 and 2? In this case? 
   Position 2: O? ✓? So we know O is at position 2? 
   And position 1: D? x? Then the secret word has? Position 1: not D? Is present? But we don't know? 

Let me think? The secret word has O at position 2? And NOR? Then what? 

So after guessing ""DONOR"": 
   If the secret word is ""HONOR"": 
        Feedback: 
           1: D (x) 
           2: O (✓) 
           3: N (✓) 
           4: O (✓) 
           5: R (✓) 
        Then we know the secret word has the pattern: [x?] O N O R? But position 1 is not D? Then it must be H? 

   And if the secret word is ""DONOR"": 
        1: D (✓) 
        2: O (✓) 
        3: N (✓)
        4: O (✓) 
        5: R (✓) 
        Solved? 

   But if there are other words? Like ""BONOR""? We don't know? 

So it provides useful information? 

But we want to guess in this turn? 

Alternatively, we can try ""HONOR""? 
   If secret is ""HONOR"": 
        H(✓) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)? 
   If secret is ""DONOR"": 
        H(x) O(✓) O(✓) ... etc? 

But the best? Since we have limited words? But we don't know? 

But in the context? Not many words? 

Another word? ""THNOR""? Not? 

Or ""PANDOR""? But 6 letters? 

So let's try ""DONOR"".

But note: we have not tried D? And we know from previous feedback that the letter D has not been tested? So no conflict? 

But we can also consider the first guess? Which had no effect? 

Let me choose ""DONOR""? Because it might solve? Or give enough info? 

Since we are at guess 3? We have only 6 tries? 

But note: the other candidate is ""HONOR"". It might be? 

But let's not gamble? We can guess ""DONOR"", then if not? Next guess? 

However, there might be another word? Like ""RENOR""? But E is out? 

Or ""MANOR""? But M out? 

So only two? So yes? 

Let us choose ""DONOR"". 

So next guess: ""DONOR""

<guess>donor</guess>### Feedback Analysis from Previous Guesses:

1. **Guess 1: CRANE**  
   - C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)  
     - Absent: C, A, E  
     - Present: R, N  
     - Positions: R not at position 2, N not at position 4.  

2. **Guess 2: MINOR**  
   - M(x), I(x), N(✓), O(✓), R(✓)  
     - Absent: M, I  
     - Correct positions:  
       - Position 3 = N  
       - Position 4 = O  
       - Position 5 = R  
     - Secret word structure: `[?][?]NOR`  

### Deductions:
- **Letters must be included**: 
  - R (position 5 confirmed), N (position 3 confirmed), O (position 4 confirmed).  
- **Letters excluded**: C, A, E, M, I.  
- **Remaining positions**: Positions 1 and 2 are unknown.  
- **Possible words**: The secret word ends with `NOR`. Candidates include:  
  - `DONOR`: D O N O R  
  - `HONOR`: H O N O R  
  - Both are valid English words fitting the pattern.  

### Strategy:
- Guess **DONOR** to test if `D` and `O` (at position 2) are present/correct.  
  - If `DONOR` is correct (all ✓), the game ends.  
  - If not, feedback will clarify:  
    - Position 1: If `D` is absent (x), `HONOR` becomes likely.  
    - Position 2: `O` may be confirmed (✓) or misplaced (-), but `HONOR` would be consistent.  
- `D` and `H` are untested letters that maximize information for the next guess if needed.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and no repeated letters to maximize information.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because:\n - It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).\n - The letters are all distinct.\n\n So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\n Interpretation:\n - C is not in the word.\n - R is in the word but not in the correct position (so R is somewhere else).\n - A is not in the word.\n - N is in the word but not in the correct position.\n - E is not in the word.\n\n Therefore, the secret word contains R and N, but not C, A, or E.\n\n Also, note that R and N are not in the positions they were in ""CRANE"". Since ""CRANE"" has R as the 2nd letter and N as the 4th letter, the secret word has R not in position 2 and N not in position 4.\n\n Now, for our next guess, we should:\n 1. Include R and N (since we know they are in the word).\n 2. Avoid C, A, E.\n 3. Use new letters that are common to gather more information.\n\n We also note the positions: \n   Position 1: not C (and not R since R was in position 2 originally? But wait, R is not at position 2 but might be at position 1? Actually, in ""CRANE"", R was in position 2 but we know it\'s not correct. We don\'t know if position 1 is ruled out for R? Actually, no: the feedback doesn\'t tell us that R can\'t be in position 1, only that it isn\'t in position 2. Similarly, N isn\'t in position 4 but could be elsewhere.\n\n However, note that the feedback for R was \'-\' meaning it is present but not at position 2. Similarly, N is present but not at position 4.\n\n So in our next guess, we can try to place R and N in different positions.\n\n Let\'s think of words that contain R and N, and without C, A, E.\n\n Common letters left: we have many consonants and vowels. We know the word doesn\'t have A or E (vowels are important). So the vowels must be from I, O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\n Given that, let\'s try to use another vowel: O or U or I.\n\n Also, we must avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, E.\n\n Let\'s try to guess a word that includes R and N, and preferably with common letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n Possibilities: words like ""BORNS"", ""HORNS"", ""TORNS"" but note we need 5 letters.\n\n However, we must be cautious: we also know that R was in position 2 in our first guess and it was wrong, so in the new word we should put R in a different position. Similarly for N: it was in position 4 and wrong, so we put N in a different position.\n\n Let\'s brainstorm some words:\n - Option: ""IRONY"" - but I and Y are new, and O is new. However, note that we don\'t know if Y is allowed? The rules say English word, yes. But let\'s check the structure: ""IRONY"" would place R in the second position again? Actually, ""IRONY"": I _ R _ at position 1, R at position 2? But we have R in our word and we know it wasn\'t in position 2 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback only said that R is in the word but not in position 2. We can still try R at position 2? Why not? Actually, we can\'t? Wait: if we put R in position 2 again, we might get the same feedback? But we know the secret word doesn\'t have R at position 2. So we should avoid putting R at position 2 again? Actually, the game allows us to do so, but it would not give new information? So we should avoid.\n\n So let\'s avoid position 2 for R and position 4 for N.\n\n Other options: \n - ""HORNS"": H O R N S -> R is at position 3 and N at position 4. That moves R and N? We know that in the secret word, N is not in position 4? So putting N at position 4 would be wasteful? But actually, the feedback we got said that when we had N at position 4, it was present but not correct. So that doesn\'t prevent the secret word from having N at position 4? Wait, no: the feedback for N was \'-\' meaning it is present but not at that position. So the secret word has N somewhere else. Therefore, the secret word does NOT have N at position 4. Similarly, R is not at position 2. Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2 and N at position 4.\n\n Therefore, in ""HORNS"": \n   R is at position 3 (which is not 2 -> allowed) \n   N is at position 4 -> but we know N is NOT in the secret word at position 4? So we should not put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it will be marked as wrong again? It doesn\'t give new information? So we should avoid placing N at position 4.\n\n Therefore, choose a word with N not at position 4.\n\n Another idea: ""RUNNY"" has repeated N? And R at position 1? But we don\'t want repeated letters unless necessary? And it has U and Y. But also, repeated N may complicate.\n\n Let me think of a word with R and N, without C, A, E, and without R in position 2 and N in position 4?\n\n Example words:\n - ""GROIN"": G R O I N -> R is in position 2? Avoid: we know R should not be at position 2? Actually, we can\'t use position 2 for R? We know the secret word doesn\'t have R at position 2? So we avoid position 2 for R.\n   Therefore, not ""GROIN"".\n\n - ""PRONG"": P R O N G -> R is in position 2? Avoid.\n\n - ""STERN"": S T E R N -> but E is in the word? We know E is absent? So no.\n\n - ""STRIP"": S T R I P -> has no N? But we must have N.\n\n We need a word that includes at least R and N.\n\n - ""TRUNK"": T R U N K -> R is at position 2? Skip.\n\n - ""BLURT"": no N.\n\n - ""BORNE"": but E is absent? Skip.\n\n - ""URBAN"": has A? Skip.\n\n - ""HORNS"" we had: and we avoid N at position 4.\n\n How about ""HORNY"": H O R N Y -> \n   Positions: \n      H(1) -> new\n      O(2) -> new\n      R(3) -> not position 2 -> ok\n      N(4) -> position 4? But we know N is not in position 4? Then why put it there? We would get a \'-\' again? So we avoid.\n\n How about moving N to a different position? Like position 5? \n\n Words: ""ROUND"": R O U N D -> \n   R is at position 1: that\'s not position 2 -> ok.\n   N is at position 4 -> we must avoid? Actually, the feedback for N was \'-\' meaning N is not at position 4? So putting N at position 4 again would be not good? But actually, the secret word has N, but not in position 4. So when we put N at position 4, it should show as \'-\' (if it\'s really not there) and that doesn\'t tell us anything new? So we lose one chance? Therefore, we can do it? But we waste a slot? We are at guess 2, so we want as much info as possible.\n\n Alternatively, we could put N in a position we haven\'t tried? Then we can know if it belongs there.\n\n We have positions: 1, 3, 5 we haven\'t placed N? Because we tried position 4.\n\n So let\'s try a word with R and N, with N not in position 4.\n\n Example: ""CORNS"" has C? We know C is absent.\n\n What about ""LORDS""? Doesn\'t have N? Skip.\n\n Another: ""MINOR"": M I N O R -> \n   Positions: N at position 3? R at position 5?\n   That avoids position 2 for R and position 4 for N? Yes, since:\n      M(1), I(2), N(3), O(4), R(5)\n   Then R is at position 5? which is new? And N is at position 3? which we haven\'t tried.\n\n Also, letters M, I, O are new. And we avoid C, A, E.\n\n But note: we must make sure we don\'t use any of the absent letters (C, A, E). This word has M, I, N, O, R -> all new? So it\'s good? Wait, I is a vowel? Yes.\n\n So let me select ""MINOR"": \n   We place:\n      M: at position 1 (new)\n      I: at position 2 (new vowel)\n      N: at position 3 (since we know it\'s not at 4, and 3 is new)\n      O: at position 4 (new vowel)\n      R: at position 5 (we know it\'s not at 2? and 5 is new)\n\n Also, we avoid position 2 for R? Yes: we placed R at position 5.\n\n Therefore, ""MINOR"" is a valid guess.\n\n However, note: what if the secret word has N at position 1? Then we haven\'t tested that? But that\'s okay? We have two known letters and we are trying new positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""DINER""? But E? Skip.\n\n Or ""HINGE""? E? Skip.\n\n So let\'s go with ""MINOR"".\n\n But wait: we know R is in the word? So we are putting it at position 5? That might be right? Or it might not? We\'ll see.\n\n Since we don\'t know the positions, it\'s worth trying.\n\n Therefore, the next guess: ""MINOR"".\n\n<guess>minor</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  \n- **C**, **A**, and **E** are **absent**.  \n- **R** and **N** are **present** but **misplaced** (not in positions 2 or 4, respectively).  \n\nFor the second guess:  \n- Must include **R** and **N**, but avoid **C**, **A**, **E**.  \n- Use new letters to maximize information.  \n- Avoid repeating misplaced positions: **R** cannot be in position 2, **N** cannot be in position 4.  \n\nChose ""MINOR"" because:  \n- Contains **R** (position 5) and **N** (position 3), avoiding invalid positions.  \n- Introduces common new letters: **M**, **I**, **O**.  \n- Tests vowels **I** and **O**, as **A** and **E** are ruled out.\n\n<guess>minor</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: minor -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n**Guess 1: CRANE**\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: present, but not in position 2 (-)\n- A: absent (x)\n- N: present, but not in position 4 (-)\n- E: absent (x)\n\nSo, the secret word contains R and N, but not C, A, or E.\n\n**Guess 2: MINOR**\n- M: absent (x)\n- I: absent (x)\n- N: correct position (position 3)! (✓)\n- O: correct position (position 4)! (✓)\n- R: correct position (position 5)! (✓)\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- N is in position 3.\n- O is in position 4.\n- R is in position 5.\n- The letters M and I are absent.\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- Position 3: N\n- Position 4: O\n- Position 5: R\n- And from guess 1, R is in the word (now confirmed in position 5) and N is in the word (confirmed in position 3). Also, no C, A, E, M, or I.\n\nSince we have three letters fixed: [?, ?, N, O, R]\n\nWe need to find the first two letters. We know the first two are not C, A, E, M, I, and they cannot be R (since R is at the end? But note: we have R at position 5 only; R might be elsewhere? Actually, the feedback from the first guess: R was misplaced, but now we have R at position 5, so it must be that R is only at position 5? But wait: the secret word might have two R\'s? However, we don\'t know. But in feedback, we only know that there is at least one R. Since we had R at position 2 in the first guess which was wrong, now R at position 5 is correct. So if there were two R\'s, then the feedback would have shown two indicators? But in the first guess, we had only one R (which was at position 2) and got a ""-"", meaning R is present but not at that position. Now at position 5 we have a ""✓"". So if the word had two R\'s, then in the first guess, we got one ""-"" for R? But we don\'t have extra feedback. Actually, Wordle-style games usually show when a letter is repeated: if the guess has two identical letters and the secret word has two, then both would be marked appropriately. But in the first guess ""CRANE"" only has one R? So we don\'t know if there are two R\'s? Actually, we only know that if we try two R\'s and the feedback shows two marks. Currently, we haven\'t tried a word with two R\'s? So we can\'t rule out duplicate R\'s? Wait, the secret word is ""N O R"" at positions 3,4,5? Then positions 1 and 2 are not R? Because if there were a duplicate R? Actually, we haven\'t encountered any feedback that requires duplicate R\'s? So we can proceed without that? But we must be cautious. Alternatively, since R is in position 5, and we know it wasn\'t in position 2 (from first guess) and now we have it in position 5? Then positions 1 and 2 could be any letter except the ones we know? Wait: but if the secret word had an R at position 1, then we would have: at position 5 also? Then we would have two R\'s? But in the feedback for the first guess, we only saw one R? Because we only had one R? So: the secret word must have at least one R? But it could have two? However, since in ""MINOR"" we have R at position 5 and got a ""✓"", and in ""CRANE"" we got a ""-"" for R (meaning it\'s present), so that R must have been accounted for? Unless the two identical letters? Actually, we haven\'t eliminated the possibility? But let\'s see: if the secret word had two R\'s? Then we haven\'t encountered any conflict? But for simplicity, let\'s assume for now that we haven\'t tried a duplicate? So we cannot be certain? However, note that the first guess ""CRANE"" did not have R at position 5? So we wouldn\'t have gotten feedback about position 5? That R might be there? Wait: in the first guess, we only tested R at position 2? So it could have been at position 5? Then we get the ""-"" for R? Which doesn\'t tell us which R? Actually, no: the secret word has R at position 5? So when we tested R at position 2, it was not correct? But that R exists at position 5? So we show a ""-"" for the R? Because the letter R is present? But we don\'t specify which one? Wait: no duplication? Then only one R? Therefore, there is exactly one R at position 5? Similarly, for N? How about duplicates for N? The first guess: N was in position 4? It was misplaced? Then now we tested N in position 3? Correct? So the secret word has exactly one N? Because if we had two N\'s? Then in the first guess, we only got one ""-"" for N? Meaning one of the N\'s? But now we have N at position 3? Then we got a ""✓"" for position 3? Then the other N? But we didn\'t test? So we can\'t know? But in the second guess, we tested only one N? So we got one ""✓"". Therefore, we don\'t know? However, the word is 5 letters? And we have positions 3,4,5 fixed? So we only have two positions left? So if the word had two R\'s? And we have R at position 5? Then position 1 or 2 must be R? Similarly? But we have a word ending with R? Like ""??NOR"". Then if we had two R\'s? Then the letters would be R in positions 1 or 2? But let\'s see the feedback from the first guess? We have R at position 2? And got a ""-"", meaning that R is present? Because we matched? But wait: if the word has R at position 2? Then we would have a ""✓"" at position 2? But we didn\'t? So R is not at position 2? Therefore, if the word had two R\'s? One at position 5 and one at position 2? Then the R at position 5 was not tested? But when we tested position 2? The R at position 2? Then feedback would show ""✓"" if R is at position 2? Or ""-"" if not? But we tested R at position 2 and got ""-"", so the secret word does not have R at position 2? Therefore, we cannot have R at position 2? So if the word has two R\'s? The second R can\'t be at position 2? But it could be at position 1? Then we haven\'t tested position 1? Now, how about N? The first guess: N was tested at position 4? And got ""-"". Then now we tested position 3? Got ""✓"". Therefore, the secret word has N at position 3? And it cannot be at position 4? Then if it had two N\'s? Then we need to consider? But again? The positions 1 and 2? Let\'s look for words that have the pattern: [?, ?, N, O, R]? And the letters are not in the absent list: C, A, E, M, I? Also, note that we have fixed three letters? And two slots? And the words must be English 5-letter words? So we can list possible words fitting the pattern * * N O R? And the first two letters? Excluding C, A, E, M, I? And possibly avoiding duplicates? But we don\'t rule them out? However, if we don\'t know, we can try a word without duplicates? Then see? \n\nCommon words ending with NOR: \n- MINOR: we tried? But we got M and I wrong? So it\'s not ""MINOR""? Because we guessed it? And we had M and I absent? So the word is? So we have to avoid M and I.\n\nPattern: _ _ N O R? \n\nPossible words: \n- DONOR: D, O? But O is already at position 4? Then D at position 1? But we haven\'t tested D? Then:\n- HONOR: H O? But then O is at position 4? And we have O at position 4? So H O and then N O R? Actually, H O N O R? Then ""HONOR"" has two O\'s? So let me spell: H-O-N-O-R? Wait: word is H O N O R? Then positions: \n   1: H? \n   2: O? But O is at position 4? Then we have two O\'s? Then the O at position 4? Is fixed? Then O at position 2? Then we must be careful? \n\nActually, the pattern: \nPosition 1: unknown letter (not C, A, E, M, I)\nPosition 2: unknown letter (not C, A, E, M, I)\nPosition 3: N\nPosition 4: O\nPosition 5: R\n\nSo the word is: [L1][L2]NOR\n\nWe need to find L1 and L2? \n\nAvailable letters: avoid C, A, E, M, I? And from the feedback, we don\'t have duplicates? But we can try words that might have duplicates? \n\nExamples:\n- ""HONOR"": letters H, O, N, O, R? Then let\'s see: \n   In the second guess ""MINOR"": \n      We tested O at position 4? Then it was marked ✓? Now, if the secret word ""HONOR"" has O at position 4? Then yes? But what about position 2? O is also at position 2? Then when we tested ""MINOR"": \n         Position 2: I? Absent? So the secret word does not have I? \n         Position 4: O? Correct? \n      But we did not test the O at position 2? So we don\'t know? \n      O is present? Definitely? Then for duplicate O? How the feedback would appear? \n      Let me simulate: \n        Secret: H O N O R\n        Guess MINOR: M (x) I (x) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)\n        But what about the first O? We didn\'t test? But the feedback only marks the actual matches? And the duplicate? If the secret word has two O\'s? Then we tested only one O? The one at position 4? Then we got ✓? Then if we had tested an O elsewhere? It would show \'-\'? But we didn\'t? So we have no feedback about the second O? \n      However, the secret word ""HONOR"" has O at position 2? And we have not tested position 2? Also, we know the first guess ""CRANE"": \n        We did not test O? So O is possible? \n      Therefore, ""HONOR"" is a candidate? \n\nSimilarly, ""DONOR"": D, O, N, O, R? Similarly? \nBut also, ""MINOR"" we tried? \n\nLet\'s list possible words? \n- DONOR: D O N O R? Pattern: D, O, N, O, R -> positions: \n   1: D\n   2: O -> then O at position 2? But we have O at position 4? Then duplicate O? \n   3: N\n   4: O\n   5: R\n\nBut in our feedback? We haven\'t tested O in position 2? So we don\'t know? \n\nAnother candidate: ""HONOR"": H O? Same? \n\nAlso, ""SONOR"": I don\'t know? SONOR? Not common? \n\nOther words? \n- ""FJORD"": F J O R D? Wait? Pattern: F J O R D -> no? The word must end with NOR? So position 3 must be N? Then ""FJORD"" is F J O R D? Then position 3 is O? Not N? Skip? \n\nWait: the pattern [letter][letter]NOR? For example:\n- _ _ N O R\n\nPossible words:\n- DONOR \n- HONOR \n- TONOR? Not common? \n- BONOR? Not common?\n- JUNOR? Not a word? \n- Only a few? \n\nWhat about the word ""MANOR""? But M? We tested M and got absent? So ""MANOR"" has M? Skip? \n\nSimilarly, ""MINOR"" we tried? \n\nWhat about ""PENOR""? Not a word? \n\nAlternatively, ""SENOR""? But it has E? And we know E is absent? Skip? \n\nAnother: ""TENOR"": T E N O R -> E is absent? Skip? \n\nSo the common words? \n- ""HONOR"" and ""DONOR""? \n\nAlso, ""CONOR"": is a name? Not common word? \nAnd ""GONOR""? Not a word? \n\nAlso, ""RANOR""? Not? \n\nSo let\'s consider ""HONOR"" and ""DONOR"". \n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested H, D? So we can choose a word that covers possible letters? \n\nBut also, note that in ""HONOR"": \n   1: H\n   2: O\n\nIn ""DONOR"": \n   1: D\n   2: O\n\nBoth have O at position 2? \n\nBut O is already fixed at position 4? Then if the secret word has O at position 2? That would be a duplicate O? \n\nNow, how about if we avoid duplicate? That would be easier? \n\nAnother possibility: ""WONOR""? Not a word? \n\nOr ""LOR"": ...? \n\nWhy not ""THORN""? But THORN: T H O R N -> pattern must end with NOR? Position 3: O? But we need position 3: N? Skip? \n\nAlternatively, we can try to think of words? \n\nAnother possibility: ""MAYOR"" doesn\'t fit? \n\nOr ""STORE"" doesn\'t fit? \n\nActually, the pattern is fixed? So we have limited words? \n\nAlso, we can check the dictionary? But we need to guess? \n\nSo let\'s try ""DONOR""? But ""DONOR"" is D O N O R? Then duplicate O? We don\'t know? \n\nSimilarly, ""HONOR"" is H O N O R? Duplicate O? \n\nBut wait: in the second guess, we tested an O? Only at position 4? And got ✓? So we know O is at position 4? But if the word has an O at position 2? Then we haven\'t tested it? So we don\'t know? \n\nTherefore, we should try a word that does not include O at position 2? For example, we can try a word that has different letters? But we don\'t have many choices? \n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that tests other vowels? Since we know A, E, I are absent? So vowels must be? U or Y? Or O again? Wait? O we tried? \n\nSo let\'s try a candidate? Or try more information? \n\nSince we have only two tries to get more information? Actually, we have more guesses? But we cannot guess directly? Because we don\'t know the first two letters? \n\nBut we can choose to try a word that includes likely letters? \n\nAnother candidate: ""JUNOR""? Not a word? \n\nWhat about ""NYMPH"" doesn\'t fit? \n\nActually, the pattern? We have * * N O R? Why not think of: \n- First letter: could be B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, S, T, W, Y,... \n- Second letter: could be? Not vowel? Since vowels: A, E, I are out? Then vowels: O, U? Or Y? \n\nBut we know O is present? But we don\'t know if duplicate? \n\nNow, let\'s try to use a word that contains letters that are likely? \n\nAlternatively? Since we have three letters fixed? And only two unknowns? And at this point? We can try to guess the entire word? \n\nSo possible words? \n- ""HONOR"": H and O at position 1 and 2? \n   But note: at position 2: O? That is? Duplicate O? \n   Now, the first guess was ""CRANE"", which had no O? So we didn\'t get feedback? \n   The second guess was ""MINOR"": \n        Position 2: I? Absent? So the secret word does not have I? \n        Position 4: O? Correct? \n   But we didn\'t test position 2? So we don\'t know? \n\nSimilarly, ""DONOR"" is D O at positions 1-2? \n\nAnother word? ""LYNOR""? Not? \n\nOr ""SYNOR""? Not? \n\nMaybe we forgot? ""MINOR"" we tried? \n\nOr ""THNOR""? No? \n\nSo it seems ""HONOR"" and ""DONOR"" are the candidates? \n\nBut note: ""BONUS"" doesn\'t fit? \n\nWhat about ""BOARD""? Doesn\'t fit? \n\nSo we must choose one? \n\nBut we have a third guess? And we can get more information? \n\nLet\'s try to use a guess that eliminates possibilities? \n\nFor example? Try a word that tests H and D? But how? \n\nExample: Guess ""DOUGH"": but not ending with NOR? \n\nBut we need a valid English word? \n\nWe can try a word that has H or D? But the pattern? \n\nAlternatively, we can break the pattern? Since we know positions 3,4,5 are fixed? But we don\'t know for positions 1 and 2? We can try a word that does not start with * * N O R? But to test letters? \n\nExample: Guess ""PLUSH""? But it doesn\'t have N,O,R? Then we get feedback on other letters? But we want to guess? \n\nBut we want to use a word that tests common letters? \n\nBut we have? We know the secret word ends with ""NOR""? \n\nSo let\'s try ""STUNK""? But k is random? \n\nBut better? We can try to include the fixed letters? So that we don\'t waste? \n\nFor instance? Make a guess that has the fixed letters (NOR) and two new letters? But the fixed letters will be forced to positions 3,4,5? But we cannot change them? \n\nSo for positions 3,4,5: must be N, O, R? \n\nThen we need to choose letters for positions 1 and 2? \n\nBut we haven\'t been able to determine them? \n\nAlternatively? We can try to use a word that has the pattern? But tests letters? \n\nBut since we don\'t know the first two? Let\'s try ""HONOR""? Or ""DONOR""? \n\nBut we have six guesses? We can try ""DONOR"": to test? \n\nIf we guess ""DONOR"": \n- Then if the secret word is ""HONOR"": \n    Feedback: \n         D: absent? Because it is H? \n         O: at position 2? But the secret word has O at position 4? Then O at position 2? We tested? We have O at position 2? Then we have duplicate? So:\n         Position 1: D? absent? \n         Position 2: O? present? but not correct? Because if the word is ""HONOR"", then position 2: O? Which is present? But it\'s a duplicate? Then the feedback would show: \n             D: x \n             O: - ? (because O is present? But position 2? The O at position 2? The secret word has O at position 4? So not at position 2? Hence the O at position 2? Would get ""-"" meaning present? But not correct? \n         Then position 3: N? ✓\n         position 4: O? ✓\n         position 5: R? ✓\n          \n         So D(x) O(-) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)\n\nBut this tells us that O is present? And we know? But at the same time? We see that D is absent? \n\nThen we know the word must have H? And O not at position 2? Then we go to ""HONOR""? \n\nBut if the word is ""DONOR"": \n      D: correct? \n      O at position 2? Correct? \n      Then feedback: D(✓) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) \n   But wait: the word ""DONOR"": D O N O R? \n        Position 1: D -> ✓? \n        Position 2: O -> ✓? \n        Position 3: N -> ✓? \n        Position 4: O -> ✓? \n        Position 5: R -> ✓? \n   Then solved? \n\nTherefore, by guessing ""DONOR"", we can win? Or get feedback? \n\nBut we have only three more guesses? So we can try? \n\nBut let\'s consider? The secret word might be something else? Like ""HONOR""? Then if we guess ""DONOR"", we get: D(x) O(-) N(✓) O(?) ... wait? Actually, we have two O\'s? The feedback might be tricky? \n\nHow does feedback handle duplicate letters in Wordle? \n- In official Wordle rules: \n   For duplicate letters in the guess? \n   If the secret word has duplicate letters? \n   Let\'s simulate:\n   Secret word: H O N O R? \n   Guess: D O N O R? \n   Position by position:\n       1: D? Absent? -> x\n       2: O? Present? But in the secret word: the first O is at position 2? Then if we compare? Actually, it should not show? Wait: the secret word has O at position 4? And also at position 2? Then when we test O at position 2? It\'s correct? Because ""HONOR"" has O at position 2? Then we should get ✓ for position 2? \n\nCorrection: \n   Secret word: H O N O R? \n   Guess: D O N O R? \n        Position 1: D vs H? Not match? \n        Position 2: O vs O? Match? ✓\n        Position 3: N vs N? ✓\n        Position 4: O vs O? ✓\n        Position 5: R vs R? ✓\n        So D(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)\n\nBut wait? Then ""DONOR"" is guessed? Then we lose? Since the secret word is ""HONOR""? Actually? The feedback for ""DONOR""? Would be:\n         D: x? Because it is D? Then no? The secret word is ""HONOR""? Then D is absent? \n         Then O: at position 2? The secret word ""HONOR"" has O at position 2? So ✓? \n         Then we get: D(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓) \n\nBut wait: the secret word has O at position 2 and position 4? At position 4? The guess has O at position 4? So match? ✓? \nTherefore, the feedback would be: \n   Position 1: D? x \n   Position 2: O? ✓ \n   Position 3: N? ✓ \n   Position 4: O? ✓ (since secret has O at position 4)\n   Position 5: R? ✓ \n\nBut in the guess ""DONOR"": \n   It has two O\'s? The first O is at position 2? And we got ✓? \n   The second O? At position 4? And we got ✓? \n   So correct feedback? \n\nNow, back? The secret word ends with NOR? Fixed? \nThen with the feedback? We see positions 3,4,5 are ✓? So we know? \nBut positions 1 and 2? In this case? \n   Position 2: O? ✓? So we know O is at position 2? \n   And position 1: D? x? Then the secret word has? Position 1: not D? Is present? But we don\'t know? \n\nLet me think? The secret word has O at position 2? And NOR? Then what? \n\nSo after guessing ""DONOR"": \n   If the secret word is ""HONOR"": \n        Feedback: \n           1: D (x) \n           2: O (✓) \n           3: N (✓) \n           4: O (✓) \n           5: R (✓) \n        Then we know the secret word has the pattern: [x?] O N O R? But position 1 is not D? Then it must be H? \n\n   And if the secret word is ""DONOR"": \n        1: D (✓) \n        2: O (✓) \n        3: N (✓)\n        4: O (✓) \n        5: R (✓) \n        Solved? \n\n   But if there are other words? Like ""BONOR""? We don\'t know? \n\nSo it provides useful information? \n\nBut we want to guess in this turn? \n\nAlternatively, we can try ""HONOR""? \n   If secret is ""HONOR"": \n        H(✓) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)? \n   If secret is ""DONOR"": \n        H(x) O(✓) O(✓) ... etc? \n\nBut the best? Since we have limited words? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut in the context? Not many words? \n\nAnother word? ""THNOR""? Not? \n\nOr ""PANDOR""? But 6 letters? \n\nSo let\'s try ""DONOR"".\n\nBut note: we have not tried D? And we know from previous feedback that the letter D has not been tested? So no conflict? \n\nBut we can also consider the first guess? Which had no effect? \n\nLet me choose ""DONOR""? Because it might solve? Or give enough info? \n\nSince we are at guess 3? We have only 6 tries? \n\nBut note: the other candidate is ""HONOR"". It might be? \n\nBut let\'s not gamble? We can guess ""DONOR"", then if not? Next guess? \n\nHowever, there might be another word? Like ""RENOR""? But E is out? \n\nOr ""MANOR""? But M out? \n\nSo only two? So yes? \n\nLet us choose ""DONOR"". \n\nSo next guess: ""DONOR""\n\n<guess>donor</guess>### Feedback Analysis from Previous Guesses:\n\n1. **Guess 1: CRANE**  \n   - C(x), R(-), A(x), N(-), E(x)  \n     - Absent: C, A, E  \n     - Present: R, N  \n     - Positions: R not at position 2, N not at position 4.  \n\n2. **Guess 2: MINOR**  \n   - M(x), I(x), N(✓), O(✓), R(✓)  \n     - Absent: M, I  \n     - Correct positions:  \n       - Position 3 = N  \n       - Position 4 = O  \n       - Position 5 = R  \n     - Secret word structure: `[?][?]NOR`  \n\n### Deductions:\n- **Letters must be included**: \n  - R (position 5 confirmed), N (position 3 confirmed), O (position 4 confirmed).  \n- **Letters excluded**: C, A, E, M, I.  \n- **Remaining positions**: Positions 1 and 2 are unknown.  \n- **Possible words**: The secret word ends with `NOR`.

We have the feedback from Guess 3: donor -> D(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)

Interpretation:
- D is absent (x) from the secret word.
- The first O is marked as ✓? But wait, the feedback is: O(✓) for the second letter? But the word ""donor"" has two O's: 
  Position 1: D -> x
  Position 2: O -> ✓
  Position 3: N -> ✓ (already known)
  Position 4: O -> ✓ (already known)
  Position 5: R -> ✓ (already known)

But note: the feedback string is ""D(x) O(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓)"". This means:
  Position 1: D -> absent (x)
  Position 2: O -> correct (✓)  [This is new information!]
  Position 3: N -> correct (✓)   [already known]
  Position 4: O -> correct (✓)   [already known]
  Position 5: R -> correct (✓)   [already known]

Therefore, we now know that the secret word has:
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: N
  Position 4: O
  Position 5: R

But position 4 is O? And position 2 is also O? So the secret word has two O's? 

And position 1: we know it is not D, and also not any of the previously absent letters: C, A, E, M, I.

So the secret word is: [letter] O N O R

We know the first letter is not D, C, A, E, M, I.

What are the possibilities? 
The word must be of the form: _ O N O R

Common English words: 
  HONOR: H O N O R

Are there others? 
  BONOR? Not a word.
  CONOR? Proper name? But Wordle uses common words? 
  GONOR? Not a word.
  LONOR? Not common.
  PONOR? Not common.
  SONOR? Not common.
  TONOR? Not common.
  WONOR? Not common.

So the only common word is ""HONOR"".

Therefore, we should guess ""HONOR"".

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if we guess ""HONOR"":
  Position 1: H -> we haven't tested H? So if the secret word is ""HONOR"", it would be ✓.
  Position 2: O -> ✓ (already known)
  Position 3: N -> ✓
  Position 4: O -> ✓
  Position 5: R -> ✓

So it should be all correct.

But what if there is another word? For example, ""TONOR""? Not a word. Or ""ZONOR""? No.

Therefore, we guess ""HONOR"".

       - Position 4 = O  
       - Position 5 = R  
     - Secret word structure: `[?]ONOR` (first letter unknown).  

### Deductions:
- **Secret word pattern**: `[?]ONOR` (e.g., `_ONOR`).  
- **Letters excluded**: C, A, E, M, I, D.  
- **Position 1 possibilities**: Must be a letter not excluded (e.g., B, F, G, H, K, L, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.).  
- **Only valid English word**: `HONOR` (H at position 1).  
  - Other combinations (e.g., BONOR, LONOR) are invalid words.  

### Next Guess:
- **HONOR** is the only common English word fitting the pattern and constraints.
