We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).

I need to make the first guess in the Wordle game. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A strong starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to cover frequent letters. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are popular because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants. 

After evaluating, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- C, R, and N are high-frequency consonants in English.
- This combination increases the likelihood of revealing correct letters or positions early.

We have feedback from the first guess:
Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)

Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word (x)
- R is in the secret word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (-)
- N is not in the secret word (x)
- E is in the secret word but in the wrong position (-)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters: R, A, E (but not in the positions they were in ""crane"").
- The secret word does not contain C or N.
- Positions:
  - Position 1: Not C, and since R is not here (but present elsewhere), we know position 1 cannot be R either? 
    Actually, the feedback for R is '-', which means R is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in other positions except 2. Similarly for A and E.

From the feedback:
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and got '-')
- A is in the word but not in position 3
- E is in the word but not in position 5

Also, note that the word must contain R, A, E.

Now, our new guess must:
- Be a valid 5-letter word.
- Include R, A, E (because they are in the secret word) and exclude C and N (and any other letters not present, but so far only C and N are excluded).
- We also know that R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

Our goal is to test other positions for these letters and possibly introduce new common letters to gather more information.

Considering the above, let's think of words that have R, A, E.

Common consonants that might pair well: T, S, L, etc.

We also note that the secret word does not have C or N, so we avoid those.

Potential words:
- We might try a word that puts R, A, E in different positions than the first guess.

In ""crane"", positions:
1: C (x) -> no C and not R? Actually, R could be at position 1? Wait, no: 
The feedback for R says it is in the word but not in position 2. That does not prevent it from being in position 1? 
In fact, in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and found incorrect for that position. So it could be in position 1? 
But wait: the first letter was guessed as C and was wrong. We don't know if R is in position 1 until we try.

However, we do know that position 1 cannot be C (since C is not in the word) and also cannot be R? No, we don't know that. 
We haven't tested R in position 1 yet. So it's possible.

Similarly, position 3 cannot be A (because that's where A was in the first guess and it was wrongly placed), and position 5 cannot be E.

Let's list banned positions for these letters:
- R cannot be in position 2
- A cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in position 5

But they can be in any other positions.

For our next guess, we want to place R, A, E in different positions to test and also use new letters to get more coverage.

Common letters left: T, L, S, D, M, etc.

Idea: use a word that starts with a vowel or a consonant we haven't tried? But since position 1 was not C, we can try another consonant.

Maybe ""IRATE""? But ""IRATE"" has I and T. 
But note: we don't know about I and T yet.

But wait, ""IRATE"" uses I which we haven't tested. Also, what about positions?

In ""IRATE"":
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: R -> but we know R cannot be in position 2? From the feedback, R was tried at 2 and was wrong. So if we put R at position 2 again, we know it would be wrong? So it's useless to put R at position 2 again. Therefore, avoid that.

So in our next guess, avoid putting R at position 2, A at position 3, and E at position 5.

We should try R in positions other than 2: positions 1, 3, 4, 5? But position 5: we know E cannot be at position 5, but R could be.

Similarly, avoid A at position 3, so try it in 1,2,4,5? But note: position 5 has E issue? Not for A.

We have to place A, R, E in the word, but with restrictions.

Alternative words:

Consider ""RADIO"": but we cannot use O? No, we don't know about O. But we must use E? Because E is in the secret word. So the word must include E? Yes, because the feedback said E is in the word.

So the word must include E. Therefore ""RADIO"" doesn't have E, so invalid.

What about ""ARISE""? 
- A in position 1? 
- R in position 2? But we cannot put R in position 2 because we know it cannot be there? We can, but we already know it's wrong so why waste? 
  Actually, if we put R in position 2, we will get feedback that it's wrong again? We know it's not there, so it doesn't help. Better to choose a word that tests R in a new position.

In ""ARISE"":
Positions:
1: A -> A was previously in position 3 (wrong) but here at position 1: we don't know if it can be at 1.
2: R -> but we know R is not at position 2? So this will definitely get '-' for R? Which we already know. 
So instead, let's avoid position 2 for R.

Better words: 
""REACT"": but has C? We know C is excluded. Cannot use C.

""TARES"": 
- T (new), A (at position 2), R (at position 3), E (at position 4), S (new).
But we need to include A, R, E? Yes, but note:
A: previously banned from position 3? Now we put it at 2? That's a new position, so it could be correct? 
Similarly, R: banned from position 2? Now put at position 3? Could be correct? 
E: banned from position 5? Now at position 4? Could be correct.

Also, ""TARES"" avoids C and N and has S which is common.

Possible word: ""TARES""

But we must ensure that we don't put the letters in the same banned positions? 
A is at position 2? Previously banned position for A is position 3? So position 2 is new? It's okay. 
R: previously banned position 2? Now at 3? Okay. 
E: previously banned position 5? Now at 4? Okay.

Moreover, we get to test T and S.

So ""TARES"" seems reasonable.

Another option: ""STARE""?
Similar: 
S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? But wait: previously, A cannot be at position 3? Because it was at position 3 and got '-'. So we know A cannot be at position 3? 
So if we put A at position 3 in ""STARE"", we know that will be wrong? Then why test it?

Actually, let's see positions for ""STARE"":
1: S
2: T
3: A -> but we know from feedback that A is not in position 3 because when we guessed ""crane"", A was at 3 and not correct. So putting it again at 3 will get a '-' again? And we know that? 
So it doesn't give new information? Worse, it uses up a slot without gaining new positional knowledge.

Therefore, ""STARE"" is not efficient because we put A in a banned position.

But in ""TARES"":
1: T (new)
2: A (new position: was placed at 3 before, now at 2)
3: R (new position: was placed at 2 before, now at 3)
4: E (new position: was placed at 5 before, now at 4)
5: S (new)

This tests new positions for R, A, E and introduces T and S.

Therefore, ""TARES"" is a good candidate.

But note: we don't know if A, R, or E are in these new positions? Exactly, so we test them.

Also, ""TARES"" is a valid word.

Another possibility: ""LATER""
- L (new), A at 2, T (new), E at 4, R at 5? 
But R at 5: which is new? 
Similarly, ""LATER"" has L instead of S? But both are common.

But still, ""LATER"" doesn't meet all? We have all three A, R, E? Yes.

However, I think it's better to cover as many frequent letters as possible. T and S are very common.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TARES"".

Summary of what we test:
- T in position 1
- A in position 2 (new position)
- R in position 3 (new position for R; previously tried at 2)
- E in position 4 (new position; previously at 5)
- S in position 5

Expected feedback possibilities will tell us:
If T is in the word and where, similarly for S, and the correctness of A, R, E in new positions.

So, I choose ""TARES"".

But wait, we also have the possibility that the word might have repeated letters? But we haven't encountered any yet? And ""TARES"" has all unique? 

Yes, ""TARES"" is all unique.

Thus, the next guess: TARES.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C and N are **excluded** (not in the secret word).  
- R, A, and E are **included** but **incorrectly positioned**:  
  - R is not in position 2.  
  - A is not in position 3.  
  - E is not in position 5.  

For the next guess, I need:  
- A valid 5-letter word containing R, A, and E (since they are in the secret word).  
- Avoid C and N completely.  
- Test R, A, and E in **new positions** (not position 2 for R, not position 3 for A, not position 5 for E).  
- Use frequent consonants like T or S for maximum coverage.  

I selected **""TARES""** because:  
- It includes all required letters: R, A, E.  
- Positions avoid previous mistakes:  
  - R is in position 3 (not tested position 2, now testing position 3).  
  - A is in position 2 (not tested position 3, now testing position 2).  
  - E is in position 4 (not tested position 5, now testing position 4).  
- It introduces new common consonants: T (position 1) and S (position 5), providing broader letter coverage.  
- It’s a valid English word (""tare"" meaning to adjust or align, or plural ""tares"").  

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores new letters (T, S) while respecting the constraints.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,amber,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).I need to make the first guess in the Wordle game. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A strong starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to cover frequent letters. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are popular because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants. 

After evaluating, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- C, R, and N are high-frequency consonants in English.
- This combination increases the likelihood of revealing correct letters or positions early.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess:
Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)

Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word (x)
- R is in the secret word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (-)
- N is not in the secret word (x)
- E is in the secret word but in the wrong position (-)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters: R, A, E (but not in the positions they were in ""crane"").
- The secret word does not contain C or N.
- Positions:
  - Position 1: Not C, and since R is not here (but present elsewhere), we know position 1 cannot be R either? 
    Actually, the feedback for R is '-', which means R is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in other positions except 2. Similarly for A and E.

From the feedback:
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and got '-')
- A is in the word but not in position 3
- E is in the word but not in position 5

Also, note that the word must contain R, A, E.

Now, our new guess must:
- Be a valid 5-letter word.
- Include R, A, E (because they are in the secret word) and exclude C and N (and any other letters not present, but so far only C and N are excluded).
- We also know that R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

Our goal is to test other positions for these letters and possibly introduce new common letters to gather more information.

Considering the above, let's think of words that have R, A, E.

Common consonants that might pair well: T, S, L, etc.

We also note that the secret word does not have C or N, so we avoid those.

Potential words:
- We might try a word that puts R, A, E in different positions than the first guess.

In ""crane"", positions:
1: C (x) -> no C and not R? Actually, R could be at position 1? Wait, no: 
The feedback for R says it is in the word but not in position 2. That does not prevent it from being in position 1? 
In fact, in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and found incorrect for that position. So it could be in position 1? 
But wait: the first letter was guessed as C and was wrong. We don't know if R is in position 1 until we try.

However, we do know that position 1 cannot be C (since C is not in the word) and also cannot be R? No, we don't know that. 
We haven't tested R in position 1 yet. So it's possible.

Similarly, position 3 cannot be A (because that's where A was in the first guess and it was wrongly placed), and position 5 cannot be E.

Let's list banned positions for these letters:
- R cannot be in position 2
- A cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in position 5

But they can be in any other positions.

For our next guess, we want to place R, A, E in different positions to test and also use new letters to get more coverage.

Common letters left: T, L, S, D, M, etc.

Idea: use a word that starts with a vowel or a consonant we haven't tried? But since position 1 was not C, we can try another consonant.

Maybe ""IRATE""? But ""IRATE"" has I and T. 
But note: we don't know about I and T yet.

But wait, ""IRATE"" uses I which we haven't tested. Also, what about positions?

In ""IRATE"":
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: R -> but we know R cannot be in position 2? From the feedback, R was tried at 2 and was wrong. So if we put R at position 2 again, we know it would be wrong? So it's useless to put R at position 2 again. Therefore, avoid that.

So in our next guess, avoid putting R at position 2, A at position 3, and E at position 5.

We should try R in positions other than 2: positions 1, 3, 4, 5? But position 5: we know E cannot be at position 5, but R could be.

Similarly, avoid A at position 3, so try it in 1,2,4,5? But note: position 5 has E issue? Not for A.

We have to place A, R, E in the word, but with restrictions.

Alternative words:

Consider ""RADIO"": but we cannot use O? No, we don't know about O. But we must use E? Because E is in the secret word. So the word must include E? Yes, because the feedback said E is in the word.

So the word must include E. Therefore ""RADIO"" doesn't have E, so invalid.

What about ""ARISE""? 
- A in position 1? 
- R in position 2? But we cannot put R in position 2 because we know it cannot be there? We can, but we already know it's wrong so why waste? 
  Actually, if we put R in position 2, we will get feedback that it's wrong again? We know it's not there, so it doesn't help. Better to choose a word that tests R in a new position.

In ""ARISE"":
Positions:
1: A -> A was previously in position 3 (wrong) but here at position 1: we don't know if it can be at 1.
2: R -> but we know R is not at position 2? So this will definitely get '-' for R? Which we already know. 
So instead, let's avoid position 2 for R.

Better words: 
""REACT"": but has C? We know C is excluded. Cannot use C.

""TARES"": 
- T (new), A (at position 2), R (at position 3), E (at position 4), S (new).
But we need to include A, R, E? Yes, but note:
A: previously banned from position 3? Now we put it at 2? That's a new position, so it could be correct? 
Similarly, R: banned from position 2? Now put at position 3? Could be correct? 
E: banned from position 5? Now at position 4? Could be correct.

Also, ""TARES"" avoids C and N and has S which is common.

Possible word: ""TARES""

But we must ensure that we don't put the letters in the same banned positions? 
A is at position 2? Previously banned position for A is position 3? So position 2 is new? It's okay. 
R: previously banned position 2? Now at 3? Okay. 
E: previously banned position 5? Now at 4? Okay.

Moreover, we get to test T and S.

So ""TARES"" seems reasonable.

Another option: ""STARE""?
Similar: 
S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? But wait: previously, A cannot be at position 3? Because it was at position 3 and got '-'. So we know A cannot be at position 3? 
So if we put A at position 3 in ""STARE"", we know that will be wrong? Then why test it?

Actually, let's see positions for ""STARE"":
1: S
2: T
3: A -> but we know from feedback that A is not in position 3 because when we guessed ""crane"", A was at 3 and not correct. So putting it again at 3 will get a '-' again? And we know that? 
So it doesn't give new information? Worse, it uses up a slot without gaining new positional knowledge.

Therefore, ""STARE"" is not efficient because we put A in a banned position.

But in ""TARES"":
1: T (new)
2: A (new position: was placed at 3 before, now at 2)
3: R (new position: was placed at 2 before, now at 3)
4: E (new position: was placed at 5 before, now at 4)
5: S (new)

This tests new positions for R, A, E and introduces T and S.

Therefore, ""TARES"" is a good candidate.

But note: we don't know if A, R, or E are in these new positions? Exactly, so we test them.

Also, ""TARES"" is a valid word.

Another possibility: ""LATER""
- L (new), A at 2, T (new), E at 4, R at 5? 
But R at 5: which is new? 
Similarly, ""LATER"" has L instead of S? But both are common.

But still, ""LATER"" doesn't meet all? We have all three A, R, E? Yes.

However, I think it's better to cover as many frequent letters as possible. T and S are very common.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TARES"".

Summary of what we test:
- T in position 1
- A in position 2 (new position)
- R in position 3 (new position for R; previously tried at 2)
- E in position 4 (new position; previously at 5)
- S in position 5

Expected feedback possibilities will tell us:
If T is in the word and where, similarly for S, and the correctness of A, R, E in new positions.

So, I choose ""TARES"".

But wait, we also have the possibility that the word might have repeated letters? But we haven't encountered any yet? And ""TARES"" has all unique? 

Yes, ""TARES"" is all unique.

Thus, the next guess: TARES.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C and N are **excluded** (not in the secret word).  
- R, A, and E are **included** but **incorrectly positioned**:  
  - R is not in position 2.  
  - A is not in position 3.  
  - E is not in position 5.  

For the next guess, I need:  
- A valid 5-letter word containing R, A, and E (since they are in the secret word).  
- Avoid C and N completely.  
- Test R, A, and E in **new positions** (not position 2 for R, not position 3 for A, not position 5 for E).  
- Use frequent consonants like T or S for maximum coverage.  

I selected **""TARES""** because:  
- It includes all required letters: R, A, E.  
- Positions avoid previous mistakes:  
  - R is in position 3 (not tested position 2, now testing position 3).  
  - A is in position 2 (not tested position 3, now testing position 2).  
  - E is in position 4 (not tested position 5, now testing position 4).  
- It introduces new common consonants: T (position 1) and S (position 5), providing broader letter coverage.  
- It’s a valid English word (""tare"" meaning to adjust or align, or plural ""tares"").  

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores new letters (T, S) while respecting the constraints.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane
Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C: not in the secret word.
- R: in the word, but not in position 2.
- A: in the word, but not in position 3.
- N: not in the secret word.
- E: in the word, but not in position 5.

Secret word contains: R, A, E.
Excludes: C, N.

Guess 2: tares
Feedback: T(x) A(-) R(-) E(✓) S(x)
Interpretation:
- T: not in the secret word.
- A: in the word, but not in position 2 (this guess had A at position 2).
- R: in the word, but not in position 3 (this guess had R at position 3).
- E: correct, meaning it is in position 4 (because feedback shows E(✓) at position 4 of tares).
- S: not in the secret word.

Therefore, combining all known information:
- Letters in the secret word: R, A, E (and E is fixed in position 4).
- Excluded letters: C, N, T, S.
- Known positions:
  - Position 4: E (from guess 2 feedback).

Also, we know:
- From guess1: A is not in position 3, R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5 (but now E is fixed at position 4).
- From guess2: A is not in position 2 (because we guessed A at position 2 and got '-'), R is not in position 3 (we guessed R at position 3 and got '-').

So current position constraints:
- Position 2: cannot be A (from guess2), and cannot be R? (From guess1: R is not in position 2, but that was already known. Now from guess2 we don't have new info for position2 regarding R? Because in guess2, position2 was A. So R can still be in other positions).
But specifically:
  - A cannot be at: position 2 (guess2), position 3 (guess1)
  - R cannot be at: position 2 (guess1), position 3 (guess2)

Since E is fixed at position 4, we have:

Secret word pattern: _ _ _ E _

Letters we know are in: A, R, plus two more letters? Wait: we have only 5 letters. We know 3: A, R, E. So two more letters to be guessed? But we don't know them yet? Or actually, the secret word might have repeated letters? But in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates? But it's possible? We should avoid assuming.

But note: in the feedback, we have excluded C, N, T, S. So the remaining letters could be any 5-letter word containing A, R, E, excluding C, N, T, S, and probably other letters already tried? Actually, we only know these exclusions.

Now, which letters are available? All English letters except C, N, T, S? We don't know about others? For example, we haven't tested B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? And among vowels, we have A (in), and E (in), but not O, I, U? Or Y?

We also know the word must include two more letters (since only three known: A,R,E). Actually, we have E at position4, so we need to find the remaining four positions? No: the word has five positions. We have one fixed: position4 is E. So we need the other positions: 1,2,3,5.

And we know A and R are in the word, so they must be placed in positions 1,2,3,5? But with constraints: A cannot be in position2 or3? And R cannot be in position2 or3? And E is at4? So positions for A: only positions 1 or 5? Similarly for R: only positions 1,4? But position4 is E? So R cannot be at4? So R must be in position 1 or 5? And A must be in position 1 or 5? 

But wait: the word might have more than one E? Then R or A could be elsewhere? We don't know? So we cannot be sure?

But let's lay it out:

Available positions: 1,2,3,5 (since 4 is E).

We must place A and R in two of these? But the word might have duplicates? For now, let's assume no duplicates? Because we haven't encountered feedback? But it's possible? We have to consider?

But in the feedback so far, no indication of duplicates? However, we can't rule out? Since we haven't guessed any duplicate letters.

But without information, we start without assuming duplicates? We can revise if later.

So for now, assume A, R are each once? Then:

A can be only in position 1 or 5? Because it cannot be in 2 (from guess2) or in 3 (from guess1). Similarly, R cannot be in position 2 (from guess1) or in position3 (from guess2). And E is at4? So R and A must be in positions 1,5? But there is also position 5? Then we have:

Positions: 1,2,3,5? We have to fill all? And we know that A and R must be placed? And we have two extra letters? For positions 2 and 3? And for the remaining spots? Actually: positions 1,2,3,5 remain? And two letters? So we need two more letters? And we place A and R in two positions? And the others are different letters?

So: positions 1,2,3,5 available? And among them, two spots must be filled by A and R? But A must be at 1 or 5? R must be at 1 or 5? But we have two positions 1 and 5? And A and R? So:

Option1: position 1: A, position 5: R? Or
Option2: position 1: R, position 5: A? 

But also: we must fill positions 2 and 3? With two other letters? Not A or R? Because if A and R are at 1 and5, then positions 2 and 3 must be two new letters? 

Therefore, the secret word pattern:
If A at1, then: A _ _ E R
If R at1, then: R _ _ E A
and positions 2 and 3: two new letters? 

But wait: note we have constraints:
In option1: A at1? But from guess2: we guessed T at position1? But E is at position4? So we don't know about position1 having others? 

However, let's formalize:

Case1: A in position1, R in position5: so word: A ?? E R? Pattern: A _ _ E R

Case2: R in position1, A in position5: so word: R ?? E A? Pattern: R _ _ E A

Now, we must also include that E is fixed at4? And positions 2 and 3: two other letters? Which cannot be C,N,T,S? And also cannot be A or R? Because we are placing A/R at 1/5? 

But could a word have repeated letters? Yes? For example, A might appear twice? But we haven't seen any indication? We have to keep in mind?

But without evidence, we proceed? And then? 

Also, we know from guess1: E is not in position5? Which is consistent because we put in position1 or5? And E is at4? 

Now, we need to guess a word that fits either pattern? And to maximize coverage? 

But in the next guess, we can choose a word that has many common letters? 

For example, for case1 pattern: A _ _ E R? Then words? Like: AIDER? But note: D and I? New letters? But I is vowel? But we haven't tested? 

However, we must exclude C,N,T,S? So AIDER: A, I, D, E, R -> E is at position4? Then: position1: A? Then I at2, D at3, E at4, R at5? So AIDER? 

Similarly, other words: ASKER? But S is excluded? Cannot. ALTER? But T excluded? Cannot? We cannot use T? 

Similarly, for case2: R _ _ E A? Like: RULER? But R at1 and5? And U at2, L at3? But then E is position4? Pattern: R U L E R? But wait: RULER has R at positions 1 and 5? So R is repeated? And the word RULER is valid? 

But we have to consider duplicates? 

Now, feedback for guess2: we got E at position4 correct? And S not in word? 

So to test case1: we could guess a word that starts with A? And ends with R? And has E at position4? 

Similarly, case2: start with R? And A at position5? 

But also, we need to cover new letters? 

So let's brainstorm words:

For case1: A ? ? E R? 
Possible words: 
AIDER (A at1, I at2, D at3, E at4, R at5): letters I and D not tested? 
AGGER (double G? and note E? but G?): but not? Also, G? 
AMBER: M and B? 
ALTER: T excluded? 
APPER: double P? 
AIMER: I and M? 
So common: AIDER, AMBER, AIMER, etc.

But we excluded T and S? So AIDER is acceptable? But D and I: new? 

For case2: R ? ? E A? 
Examples: RACEA? Not? 
RIPEA? Not? 
RULER: R at1, U at2, L at3, E at4, R at5? But R at5? 
RUBEA? Not? 
RUMEA? Not? 
Common words: RUPEE? But E repeated? Position: R U P E E? So position5 is E? But we need position5 to be A? So not? 
Only words ending with A? 
So: RARER? R repeated? But has A? Pattern: R at1, A at2? But we can't have A at2? Because from guess2 we know A not at2? So pattern R _ _ E A: so position2 must be something else? 

So for R _ _ E A:
Position1: R, position5: A? And position2: new letter? 
Words: 
RODEO? But O? And E? Position E at4? But RODEO ends with O? Not? 
Rated? T excluded? 
Rabid: B? 
Rally: L? 
Radio: O? but no E? We must have E at position4? So the word must have E at position4? So pattern must be R * * E A? 

So: R _ _ E A? 
English words? 
Examples: RONEA? Not? 
ROTEA? But T excluded? 
ROMEA? 
RUBEA? Not? 
Actually, ""ROYEA"" (a plant genus) but very rare? 
More common? 
Possibly: RANEE? But R at1? A at2? But A at2: we know A cannot be at position2? So if we try RANEE: R at1, A at2, N? But N excluded? A at2? We already know A is not at2? So if we guess that, feedback would say A not at2? Which we know? 

So the word must not have A at position2? So we cannot use RANEE? 

Similarly, other words: ROKEE? Not? 
Actually, common words: I can't think of any at the moment? 

Perhaps RULER? But with A at5? We don't have A at5? 

Alternatively, we consider duplicate letters? 

But for simplicity? 

Given the constraints, it's more likely that case1 is the pattern? Because A _ _ E R? Words like AIDER are quite common? 

So we can guess a word that matches case1? 

But note: we don't know which? Case1 or case2? 

We can also try to test both options? But we have one guess? We can pick a word that tests the possible positions? 

Since we have limited positions: A can only be 1 or 5? Similarly R? So we can guess a word that has A at position1? If it is correct? We get feedback? 

But similarly, if we pick a word that doesn't commit to one case? 

But we know E at4? And we must use new letters? 

Let me try to pick? 

Idea: Guessing ""AIDER""? 
- A at position1? Which might be correct? 
- Also, introduces D and I? 
- Pattern: A I D E R? 
If pattern? 

But if case2 is true (R _ _ E A)? Then we miss? 

But in case2, we are having trouble finding words? 

Moreover, RULER? But that has A not? 

Perhaps ""REAVE""? But it doesn't end with A? 

So actually, common words for R _ _ E A? 

""Rare"" with E? No? 

""Ran?"": 

Actually, ""RAYEA"" is obscure? 

So perhaps case2 might not be? 

Therefore, it seems pattern A _ _ E R might be more likely? 

We can also note: from ""crane"": E was in the word? And E is also at position4? So? 

Moreover, we can choose a word that doesn't fix A at1 or R at5? But we need to? 

But we can place A at1? If not? Then we know? 

Similarly, we can place R at position1? 

But we have positions: 

Possible placements: 
Position1: either A or R? Because only these two? 
Position5: then the other? 

But we must fill positions 2 and 3? With new letters? So we have flexibility? 

So our next guess could be, for example, ""AIDER"" to test the case1? 

If we guess ""AIDER"": 
If pattern is case1: we may get A(✓) I(x?) etc? 
Or if not? Then A might be wrong? Meaning position1 is not A? So case2 might hold? 

Thus, we can use ""AIDER"" to test? 

Moreover, ""AIDER"" uses D and I? Common letters? 

Similarly, we could guess ""RIVER""? But R at1, I at2, V at3, E at4? Then R at5? But we don't have a fifth letter? If we put R at position5? That would be RIVER? But that's five letters? R I V E R? So positions: R at1? Then I at2, V at3, E at4? Then R at5? So pattern R I V E R? But what about A? A is not included? 

But the secret word must contain A? If we guess ""RIVER"", and if the secret word has A? Then we wouldn't get everything? 

So we must include A! Therefore, in any guess? We must have R, A, and E? 

Therefore, our next guess must include R, A, E? Because they are in the word? 

In ""AIDER"": A,I,D,E,R? So has A at1? R at5? So yes? Includes A, E and R? 

In case we guess case2? Like "" ???A"" that ends with A? But what word? RULER doesn't have A? 

So to include A if we guess for case2? We must have a word starting with R? and ending with A? And E at4? So word: R * * E A? 

But R _ _ E A? As above? 

One common word? ""Rotane""? Not five letter? ""Rotea""? Not word? 

Actually, ""ROSEA"" ? But S excluded? 

""ROWEA""? Not word? 

How about ""REJUA""? Not? 

It's difficult? So likely case2 pattern may not be? 

Therefore, I think it's safer to guess ""AIDER""? 

Moreover, it follows the constraints? 

Also, we test: 
Position1: A? If correct? 
Position2: I? 
Position3: D? 
Position4: E? 
Position5: R? 

Feedback will tell us:

If A is at1? Then we get ✓? Otherwise? If we get x or -? 

Similarly, R at5? 

We also test I and D? 

Now, if pattern is not as guessed? But at least we cover new consonants? 

Moreover, note how many words we have? 

So I will choose ""AIDER"". 

Alternative: ""AMBER""? With M and B? But same as? 

But ""AIDER"" is more common? 

Thus, guess: ""AIDER""
</think>
Based on the feedback from both guesses:

- **C, N, T, S** are **excluded** (not in the secret word).
- **R, A, E** are **included**:
  - **E** is in **position 4** (confirmed ✓ from guess 2).
  - **A** cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback).
  - **R** cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback).
- Therefore, **A** must be in position **1 or 5**, and **R** must be in the **remaining position** (1 or 5), as positions 2 and 3 are now banned for both.
- The secret word has the pattern: `[A/R] ? ? E [R/A]`, with positions 2 and 3 filled by unknown letters (not C, N, T, S, and excluding A/R if no duplicates).

For this guess:
- I need to include **A, R, E** (since they are in the word).
- Prioritize testing **position 1** for **A or R** and **position 5** for the other.
- Introduce new frequent letters to cover more ground (e.g., I, D, L, M, O, U).

I selected **""AIDER""** because:
- It tests **A in position 1** and **R in position 5**, resolving the pattern uncertainty.
- It includes E in position 4 (correctly placed).
- It introduces **I (position 2)** and **D (position 3)**, covering common consonants and vowels.
- It adheres to all constraints and avoids excluded letters (C, N, T, S).

This guess efficiently narrows down the secret word by validating the likely pattern while gathering new letter information.

<guess>aider</guess>",aider,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane
Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C: not in the secret word.
- R: in the word, but not in position 2.
- A: in the word, but not in position 3.
- N: not in the secret word.
- E: in the word, but not in position 5.

Secret word contains: R, A, E.
Excludes: C, N.

Guess 2: tares
Feedback: T(x) A(-) R(-) E(✓) S(x)
Interpretation:
- T: not in the secret word.
- A: in the word, but not in position 2 (this guess had A at position 2).
- R: in the word, but not in position 3 (this guess had R at position 3).
- E: correct, meaning it is in position 4 (because feedback shows E(✓) at position 4 of tares).
- S: not in the secret word.

Therefore, combining all known information:
- Letters in the secret word: R, A, E (and E is fixed in position 4).
- Excluded letters: C, N, T, S.
- Known positions:
  - Position 4: E (from guess 2 feedback).

Also, we know:
- From guess1: A is not in position 3, R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5 (but now E is fixed at position 4).
- From guess2: A is not in position 2 (because we guessed A at position 2 and got '-'), R is not in position 3 (we guessed R at position 3 and got '-').

So current position constraints:
- Position 2: cannot be A (from guess2), and cannot be R? (From guess1: R is not in position 2, but that was already known. Now from guess2 we don't have new info for position2 regarding R? Because in guess2, position2 was A. So R can still be in other positions).
But specifically:
  - A cannot be at: position 2 (guess2), position 3 (guess1)
  - R cannot be at: position 2 (guess1), position 3 (guess2)

Since E is fixed at position 4, we have:

Secret word pattern: _ _ _ E _

Letters we know are in: A, R, plus two more letters? Wait: we have only 5 letters. We know 3: A, R, E. So two more letters to be guessed? But we don't know them yet? Or actually, the secret word might have repeated letters? But in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates? But it's possible? We should avoid assuming.

But note: in the feedback, we have excluded C, N, T, S. So the remaining letters could be any 5-letter word containing A, R, E, excluding C, N, T, S, and probably other letters already tried? Actually, we only know these exclusions.

Now, which letters are available? All English letters except C, N, T, S? We don't know about others? For example, we haven't tested B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? And among vowels, we have A (in), and E (in), but not O, I, U? Or Y?

We also know the word must include two more letters (since only three known: A,R,E). Actually, we have E at position4, so we need to find the remaining four positions? No: the word has five positions. We have one fixed: position4 is E. So we need the other positions: 1,2,3,5.

And we know A and R are in the word, so they must be placed in positions 1,2,3,5? But with constraints: A cannot be in position2 or3? And R cannot be in position2 or3? And E is at4? So positions for A: only positions 1 or 5? Similarly for R: only positions 1,4? But position4 is E? So R cannot be at4? So R must be in position 1 or 5? And A must be in position 1 or 5? 

But wait: the word might have more than one E? Then R or A could be elsewhere? We don't know? So we cannot be sure?

But let's lay it out:

Available positions: 1,2,3,5 (since 4 is E).

We must place A and R in two of these? But the word might have duplicates? For now, let's assume no duplicates? Because we haven't encountered feedback? But it's possible? We have to consider?

But in the feedback so far, no indication of duplicates? However, we can't rule out? Since we haven't guessed any duplicate letters.

But without information, we start without assuming duplicates? We can revise if later.

So for now, assume A, R are each once? Then:

A can be only in position 1 or 5? Because it cannot be in 2 (from guess2) or in 3 (from guess1). Similarly, R cannot be in position 2 (from guess1) or in position3 (from guess2). And E is at4? So R and A must be in positions 1,5? But there is also position 5? Then we have:

Positions: 1,2,3,5? We have to fill all? And we know that A and R must be placed? And we have two extra letters? For positions 2 and 3? And for the remaining spots? Actually: positions 1,2,3,5 remain? And two letters? So we need two more letters? And we place A and R in two positions? And the others are different letters?

So: positions 1,2,3,5 available? And among them, two spots must be filled by A and R? But A must be at 1 or 5? R must be at 1 or 5? But we have two positions 1 and 5? And A and R? So:

Option1: position 1: A, position 5: R? Or
Option2: position 1: R, position 5: A? 

But also: we must fill positions 2 and 3? With two other letters? Not A or R? Because if A and R are at 1 and5, then positions 2 and 3 must be two new letters? 

Therefore, the secret word pattern:
If A at1, then: A _ _ E R
If R at1, then: R _ _ E A
and positions 2 and 3: two new letters? 

But wait: note we have constraints:
In option1: A at1? But from guess2: we guessed T at position1? But E is at position4? So we don't know about position1 having others? 

However, let's formalize:

Case1: A in position1, R in position5: so word: A ?? E R? Pattern: A _ _ E R

Case2: R in position1, A in position5: so word: R ?? E A? Pattern: R _ _ E A

Now, we must also include that E is fixed at4? And positions 2 and 3: two other letters? Which cannot be C,N,T,S? And also cannot be A or R? Because we are placing A/R at 1/5? 

But could a word have repeated letters? Yes? For example, A might appear twice? But we haven't seen any indication? We have to keep in mind?

But without evidence, we proceed? And then? 

Also, we know from guess1: E is not in position5? Which is consistent because we put in position1 or5? And E is at4? 

Now, we need to guess a word that fits either pattern? And to maximize coverage? 

But in the next guess, we can choose a word that has many common letters? 

For example, for case1 pattern: A _ _ E R? Then words? Like: AIDER? But note: D and I? New letters? But I is vowel? But we haven't tested? 

However, we must exclude C,N,T,S? So AIDER: A, I, D, E, R -> E is at position4? Then: position1: A? Then I at2, D at3, E at4, R at5? So AIDER? 

Similarly, other words: ASKER? But S is excluded? Cannot. ALTER? But T excluded? Cannot? We cannot use T? 

Similarly, for case2: R _ _ E A? Like: RULER? But R at1 and5? And U at2, L at3? But then E is position4? Pattern: R U L E R? But wait: RULER has R at positions 1 and 5? So R is repeated? And the word RULER is valid? 

But we have to consider duplicates? 

Now, feedback for guess2: we got E at position4 correct? And S not in word? 

So to test case1: we could guess a word that starts with A? And ends with R? And has E at position4? 

Similarly, case2: start with R? And A at position5? 

But also, we need to cover new letters? 

So let's brainstorm words:

For case1: A ? ? E R? 
Possible words: 
AIDER (A at1, I at2, D at3, E at4, R at5): letters I and D not tested? 
AGGER (double G? and note E? but G?): but not? Also, G? 
AMBER: M and B? 
ALTER: T excluded? 
APPER: double P? 
AIMER: I and M? 
So common: AIDER, AMBER, AIMER, etc.

But we excluded T and S? So AIDER is acceptable? But D and I: new? 

For case2: R ? ? E A? 
Examples: RACEA? Not? 
RIPEA? Not? 
RULER: R at1, U at2, L at3, E at4, R at5? But R at5? 
RUBEA? Not? 
RUMEA? Not? 
Common words: RUPEE? But E repeated? Position: R U P E E? So position5 is E? But we need position5 to be A? So not? 
Only words ending with A? 
So: RARER? R repeated? But has A? Pattern: R at1, A at2? But we can't have A at2? Because from guess2 we know A not at2? So pattern R _ _ E A: so position2 must be something else? 

So for R _ _ E A:
Position1: R, position5: A? And position2: new letter? 
Words: 
RODEO? But O? And E? Position E at4? But RODEO ends with O? Not? 
Rated? T excluded? 
Rabid: B? 
Rally: L? 
Radio: O? but no E? We must have E at position4? So the word must have E at position4? So pattern must be R * * E A? 

So: R _ _ E A? 
English words? 
Examples: RONEA? Not? 
ROTEA? But T excluded? 
ROMEA? 
RUBEA? Not? 
Actually, ""ROYEA"" (a plant genus) but very rare? 
More common? 
Possibly: RANEE? But R at1? A at2? But A at2: we know A cannot be at position2? So if we try RANEE: R at1, A at2, N? But N excluded? A at2? We already know A is not at2? So if we guess that, feedback would say A not at2? Which we know? 

So the word must not have A at position2? So we cannot use RANEE? 

Similarly, other words: ROKEE? Not? 
Actually, common words: I can't think of any at the moment? 

Perhaps RULER? But with A at5? We don't have A at5? 

Alternatively, we consider duplicate letters? 

But for simplicity? 

Given the constraints, it's more likely that case1 is the pattern? Because A _ _ E R? Words like AIDER are quite common? 

So we can guess a word that matches case1? 

But note: we don't know which? Case1 or case2? 

We can also try to test both options? But we have one guess? We can pick a word that tests the possible positions? 

Since we have limited positions: A can only be 1 or 5? Similarly R? So we can guess a word that has A at position1? If it is correct? We get feedback? 

But similarly, if we pick a word that doesn't commit to one case? 

But we know E at4? And we must use new letters? 

Let me try to pick? 

Idea: Guessing ""AIDER""? 
- A at position1? Which might be correct? 
- Also, introduces D and I? 
- Pattern: A I D E R? 
If pattern? 

But if case2 is true (R _ _ E A)? Then we miss? 

But in case2, we are having trouble finding words? 

Moreover, RULER? But that has A not? 

Perhaps ""REAVE""? But it doesn't end with A? 

So actually, common words for R _ _ E A? 

""Rare"" with E? No? 

""Ran?"": 

Actually, ""RAYEA"" is obscure? 

So perhaps case2 might not be? 

Therefore, it seems pattern A _ _ E R might be more likely? 

We can also note: from ""crane"": E was in the word? And E is also at position4? So? 

Moreover, we can choose a word that doesn't fix A at1 or R at5? But we need to? 

But we can place A at1? If not? Then we know? 

Similarly, we can place R at position1? 

But we have positions: 

Possible placements: 
Position1: either A or R? Because only these two? 
Position5: then the other? 

But we must fill positions 2 and 3? With new letters? So we have flexibility? 

So our next guess could be, for example, ""AIDER"" to test the case1? 

If we guess ""AIDER"": 
If pattern is case1: we may get A(✓) I(x?) etc? 
Or if not? Then A might be wrong? Meaning position1 is not A? So case2 might hold? 

Thus, we can use ""AIDER"" to test? 

Moreover, ""AIDER"" uses D and I? Common letters? 

Similarly, we could guess ""RIVER""? But R at1, I at2, V at3, E at4? Then R at5? But we don't have a fifth letter? If we put R at position5? That would be RIVER? But that's five letters? R I V E R? So positions: R at1? Then I at2, V at3, E at4? Then R at5? So pattern R I V E R? But what about A? A is not included? 

But the secret word must contain A? If we guess ""RIVER"", and if the secret word has A? Then we wouldn't get everything? 

So we must include A! Therefore, in any guess? We must have R, A, and E? 

Therefore, our next guess must include R, A, E? Because they are in the word? 

In ""AIDER"": A,I,D,E,R? So has A at1? R at5? So yes? Includes A, E and R? 

In case we guess case2? Like "" ???A"" that ends with A? But what word? RULER doesn't have A? 

So to include A if we guess for case2? We must have a word starting with R? and ending with A? And E at4? So word: R * * E A? 

But R _ _ E A? As above? 

One common word? ""Rotane""? Not five letter? ""Rotea""? Not word? 

Actually, ""ROSEA"" ? But S excluded? 

""ROWEA""? Not word? 

How about ""REJUA""? Not? 

It's difficult? So likely case2 pattern may not be? 

Therefore, I think it's safer to guess ""AIDER""? 

Moreover, it follows the constraints? 

Also, we test: 
Position1: A? If correct? 
Position2: I? 
Position3: D? 
Position4: E? 
Position5: R? 

Feedback will tell us:

If A is at1? Then we get ✓? Otherwise? If we get x or -? 

Similarly, R at5? 

We also test I and D? 

Now, if pattern is not as guessed? But at least we cover new consonants? 

Moreover, note how many words we have? 

So I will choose ""AIDER"". 

Alternative: ""AMBER""? With M and B? But same as? 

But ""AIDER"" is more common? 

Thus, guess: ""AIDER""Based on the feedback from both guesses:

- **C, N, T, S** are **excluded** (not in the secret word).
- **R, A, E** are **included**:
  - **E** is in **position 4** (confirmed ✓ from guess 2).
  - **A** cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback).
  - **R** cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback).
- Therefore, **A** must be in position **1 or 5**, and **R** must be in the **remaining position** (1 or 5), as positions 2 and 3 are now banned for both.
- The secret word has the pattern: `[A/R] ? ? E [R/A]`, with positions 2 and 3 filled by unknown letters (not C, N, T, S, and excluding A/R if no duplicates).

For this guess:
- I need to include **A, R, E** (since they are in the word).
- Prioritize testing **position 1** for **A or R** and **position 5** for the other.
- Introduce new frequent letters to cover more ground (e.g., I, D, L, M, O, U).

I selected **""AIDER""** because:
- It tests **A in position 1** and **R in position 5**, resolving the pattern uncertainty.
- It includes E in position 4 (correctly placed).
- It introduces **I (position 2)** and **D (position 3)**, covering common consonants and vowels.
- It adheres to all constraints and avoids excluded letters (C, N, T, S).

This guess efficiently narrows down the secret word by validating the likely pattern while gathering new letter information.",Guess 3: aider -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) I(x) D(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,amber,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).I need to make the first guess in the Wordle game. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A strong starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to cover frequent letters. Words like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are popular because they contain multiple vowels and common consonants. 

After evaluating, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- C, R, and N are high-frequency consonants in English.
- This combination increases the likelihood of revealing correct letters or positions early.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess:
Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)

Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word (x)
- R is in the secret word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the secret word but in the wrong position (-)
- N is not in the secret word (x)
- E is in the secret word but in the wrong position (-)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters: R, A, E (but not in the positions they were in ""crane"").
- The secret word does not contain C or N.
- Positions:
  - Position 1: Not C, and since R is not here (but present elsewhere), we know position 1 cannot be R either? 
    Actually, the feedback for R is '-', which means R is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in other positions except 2. Similarly for A and E.

From the feedback:
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and got '-')
- A is in the word but not in position 3
- E is in the word but not in position 5

Also, note that the word must contain R, A, E.

Now, our new guess must:
- Be a valid 5-letter word.
- Include R, A, E (because they are in the secret word) and exclude C and N (and any other letters not present, but so far only C and N are excluded).
- We also know that R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

Our goal is to test other positions for these letters and possibly introduce new common letters to gather more information.

Considering the above, let's think of words that have R, A, E.

Common consonants that might pair well: T, S, L, etc.

We also note that the secret word does not have C or N, so we avoid those.

Potential words:
- We might try a word that puts R, A, E in different positions than the first guess.

In ""crane"", positions:
1: C (x) -> no C and not R? Actually, R could be at position 1? Wait, no: 
The feedback for R says it is in the word but not in position 2. That does not prevent it from being in position 1? 
In fact, in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and found incorrect for that position. So it could be in position 1? 
But wait: the first letter was guessed as C and was wrong. We don't know if R is in position 1 until we try.

However, we do know that position 1 cannot be C (since C is not in the word) and also cannot be R? No, we don't know that. 
We haven't tested R in position 1 yet. So it's possible.

Similarly, position 3 cannot be A (because that's where A was in the first guess and it was wrongly placed), and position 5 cannot be E.

Let's list banned positions for these letters:
- R cannot be in position 2
- A cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in position 5

But they can be in any other positions.

For our next guess, we want to place R, A, E in different positions to test and also use new letters to get more coverage.

Common letters left: T, L, S, D, M, etc.

Idea: use a word that starts with a vowel or a consonant we haven't tried? But since position 1 was not C, we can try another consonant.

Maybe ""IRATE""? But ""IRATE"" has I and T. 
But note: we don't know about I and T yet.

But wait, ""IRATE"" uses I which we haven't tested. Also, what about positions?

In ""IRATE"":
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: R -> but we know R cannot be in position 2? From the feedback, R was tried at 2 and was wrong. So if we put R at position 2 again, we know it would be wrong? So it's useless to put R at position 2 again. Therefore, avoid that.

So in our next guess, avoid putting R at position 2, A at position 3, and E at position 5.

We should try R in positions other than 2: positions 1, 3, 4, 5? But position 5: we know E cannot be at position 5, but R could be.

Similarly, avoid A at position 3, so try it in 1,2,4,5? But note: position 5 has E issue? Not for A.

We have to place A, R, E in the word, but with restrictions.

Alternative words:

Consider ""RADIO"": but we cannot use O? No, we don't know about O. But we must use E? Because E is in the secret word. So the word must include E? Yes, because the feedback said E is in the word.

So the word must include E. Therefore ""RADIO"" doesn't have E, so invalid.

What about ""ARISE""? 
- A in position 1? 
- R in position 2? But we cannot put R in position 2 because we know it cannot be there? We can, but we already know it's wrong so why waste? 
  Actually, if we put R in position 2, we will get feedback that it's wrong again? We know it's not there, so it doesn't help. Better to choose a word that tests R in a new position.

In ""ARISE"":
Positions:
1: A -> A was previously in position 3 (wrong) but here at position 1: we don't know if it can be at 1.
2: R -> but we know R is not at position 2? So this will definitely get '-' for R? Which we already know. 
So instead, let's avoid position 2 for R.

Better words: 
""REACT"": but has C? We know C is excluded. Cannot use C.

""TARES"": 
- T (new), A (at position 2), R (at position 3), E (at position 4), S (new).
But we need to include A, R, E? Yes, but note:
A: previously banned from position 3? Now we put it at 2? That's a new position, so it could be correct? 
Similarly, R: banned from position 2? Now put at position 3? Could be correct? 
E: banned from position 5? Now at position 4? Could be correct.

Also, ""TARES"" avoids C and N and has S which is common.

Possible word: ""TARES""

But we must ensure that we don't put the letters in the same banned positions? 
A is at position 2? Previously banned position for A is position 3? So position 2 is new? It's okay. 
R: previously banned position 2? Now at 3? Okay. 
E: previously banned position 5? Now at 4? Okay.

Moreover, we get to test T and S.

So ""TARES"" seems reasonable.

Another option: ""STARE""?
Similar: 
S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? But wait: previously, A cannot be at position 3? Because it was at position 3 and got '-'. So we know A cannot be at position 3? 
So if we put A at position 3 in ""STARE"", we know that will be wrong? Then why test it?

Actually, let's see positions for ""STARE"":
1: S
2: T
3: A -> but we know from feedback that A is not in position 3 because when we guessed ""crane"", A was at 3 and not correct. So putting it again at 3 will get a '-' again? And we know that? 
So it doesn't give new information? Worse, it uses up a slot without gaining new positional knowledge.

Therefore, ""STARE"" is not efficient because we put A in a banned position.

But in ""TARES"":
1: T (new)
2: A (new position: was placed at 3 before, now at 2)
3: R (new position: was placed at 2 before, now at 3)
4: E (new position: was placed at 5 before, now at 4)
5: S (new)

This tests new positions for R, A, E and introduces T and S.

Therefore, ""TARES"" is a good candidate.

But note: we don't know if A, R, or E are in these new positions? Exactly, so we test them.

Also, ""TARES"" is a valid word.

Another possibility: ""LATER""
- L (new), A at 2, T (new), E at 4, R at 5? 
But R at 5: which is new? 
Similarly, ""LATER"" has L instead of S? But both are common.

But still, ""LATER"" doesn't meet all? We have all three A, R, E? Yes.

However, I think it's better to cover as many frequent letters as possible. T and S are very common.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TARES"".

Summary of what we test:
- T in position 1
- A in position 2 (new position)
- R in position 3 (new position for R; previously tried at 2)
- E in position 4 (new position; previously at 5)
- S in position 5

Expected feedback possibilities will tell us:
If T is in the word and where, similarly for S, and the correctness of A, R, E in new positions.

So, I choose ""TARES"".

But wait, we also have the possibility that the word might have repeated letters? But we haven't encountered any yet? And ""TARES"" has all unique? 

Yes, ""TARES"" is all unique.

Thus, the next guess: TARES.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C and N are **excluded** (not in the secret word).  
- R, A, and E are **included** but **incorrectly positioned**:  
  - R is not in position 2.  
  - A is not in position 3.  
  - E is not in position 5.  

For the next guess, I need:  
- A valid 5-letter word containing R, A, and E (since they are in the secret word).  
- Avoid C and N completely.  
- Test R, A, and E in **new positions** (not position 2 for R, not position 3 for A, not position 5 for E).  
- Use frequent consonants like T or S for maximum coverage.  

I selected **""TARES""** because:  
- It includes all required letters: R, A, E.  
- Positions avoid previous mistakes:  
  - R is in position 3 (not tested position 2, now testing position 3).  
  - A is in position 2 (not tested position 3, now testing position 2).  
  - E is in position 4 (not tested position 5, now testing position 4).  
- It introduces new common consonants: T (position 1) and S (position 5), providing broader letter coverage.  
- It’s a valid English word (""tare"" meaning to adjust or align, or plural ""tares"").  

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores new letters (T, S) while respecting the constraints.

<guess>tares</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) R(-) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane
Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C: not in the secret word.
- R: in the word, but not in position 2.
- A: in the word, but not in position 3.
- N: not in the secret word.
- E: in the word, but not in position 5.

Secret word contains: R, A, E.
Excludes: C, N.

Guess 2: tares
Feedback: T(x) A(-) R(-) E(✓) S(x)
Interpretation:
- T: not in the secret word.
- A: in the word, but not in position 2 (this guess had A at position 2).
- R: in the word, but not in position 3 (this guess had R at position 3).
- E: correct, meaning it is in position 4 (because feedback shows E(✓) at position 4 of tares).
- S: not in the secret word.

Therefore, combining all known information:
- Letters in the secret word: R, A, E (and E is fixed in position 4).
- Excluded letters: C, N, T, S.
- Known positions:
  - Position 4: E (from guess 2 feedback).

Also, we know:
- From guess1: A is not in position 3, R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5 (but now E is fixed at position 4).
- From guess2: A is not in position 2 (because we guessed A at position 2 and got '-'), R is not in position 3 (we guessed R at position 3 and got '-').

So current position constraints:
- Position 2: cannot be A (from guess2), and cannot be R? (From guess1: R is not in position 2, but that was already known. Now from guess2 we don't have new info for position2 regarding R? Because in guess2, position2 was A. So R can still be in other positions).
But specifically:
  - A cannot be at: position 2 (guess2), position 3 (guess1)
  - R cannot be at: position 2 (guess1), position 3 (guess2)

Since E is fixed at position 4, we have:

Secret word pattern: _ _ _ E _

Letters we know are in: A, R, plus two more letters? Wait: we have only 5 letters. We know 3: A, R, E. So two more letters to be guessed? But we don't know them yet? Or actually, the secret word might have repeated letters? But in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates? But it's possible? We should avoid assuming.

But note: in the feedback, we have excluded C, N, T, S. So the remaining letters could be any 5-letter word containing A, R, E, excluding C, N, T, S, and probably other letters already tried? Actually, we only know these exclusions.

Now, which letters are available? All English letters except C, N, T, S? We don't know about others? For example, we haven't tested B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? And among vowels, we have A (in), and E (in), but not O, I, U? Or Y?

We also know the word must include two more letters (since only three known: A,R,E). Actually, we have E at position4, so we need to find the remaining four positions? No: the word has five positions. We have one fixed: position4 is E. So we need the other positions: 1,2,3,5.

And we know A and R are in the word, so they must be placed in positions 1,2,3,5? But with constraints: A cannot be in position2 or3? And R cannot be in position2 or3? And E is at4? So positions for A: only positions 1 or 5? Similarly for R: only positions 1,4? But position4 is E? So R cannot be at4? So R must be in position 1 or 5? And A must be in position 1 or 5? 

But wait: the word might have more than one E? Then R or A could be elsewhere? We don't know? So we cannot be sure?

But let's lay it out:

Available positions: 1,2,3,5 (since 4 is E).

We must place A and R in two of these? But the word might have duplicates? For now, let's assume no duplicates? Because we haven't encountered feedback? But it's possible? We have to consider?

But in the feedback so far, no indication of duplicates? However, we can't rule out? Since we haven't guessed any duplicate letters.

But without information, we start without assuming duplicates? We can revise if later.

So for now, assume A, R are each once? Then:

A can be only in position 1 or 5? Because it cannot be in 2 (from guess2) or in 3 (from guess1). Similarly, R cannot be in position 2 (from guess1) or in position3 (from guess2). And E is at4? So R and A must be in positions 1,5? But there is also position 5? Then we have:

Positions: 1,2,3,5? We have to fill all? And we know that A and R must be placed? And we have two extra letters? For positions 2 and 3? And for the remaining spots? Actually: positions 1,2,3,5 remain? And two letters? So we need two more letters? And we place A and R in two positions? And the others are different letters?

So: positions 1,2,3,5 available? And among them, two spots must be filled by A and R? But A must be at 1 or 5? R must be at 1 or 5? But we have two positions 1 and 5? And A and R? So:

Option1: position 1: A, position 5: R? Or
Option2: position 1: R, position 5: A? 

But also: we must fill positions 2 and 3? With two other letters? Not A or R? Because if A and R are at 1 and5, then positions 2 and 3 must be two new letters? 

Therefore, the secret word pattern:
If A at1, then: A _ _ E R
If R at1, then: R _ _ E A
and positions 2 and 3: two new letters? 

But wait: note we have constraints:
In option1: A at1? But from guess2: we guessed T at position1? But E is at position4? So we don't know about position1 having others? 

However, let's formalize:

Case1: A in position1, R in position5: so word: A ?? E R? Pattern: A _ _ E R

Case2: R in position1, A in position5: so word: R ?? E A? Pattern: R _ _ E A

Now, we must also include that E is fixed at4? And positions 2 and 3: two other letters? Which cannot be C,N,T,S? And also cannot be A or R? Because we are placing A/R at 1/5? 

But could a word have repeated letters? Yes? For example, A might appear twice? But we haven't seen any indication? We have to keep in mind?

But without evidence, we proceed? And then? 

Also, we know from guess1: E is not in position5? Which is consistent because we put in position1 or5? And E is at4? 

Now, we need to guess a word that fits either pattern? And to maximize coverage? 

But in the next guess, we can choose a word that has many common letters? 

For example, for case1 pattern: A _ _ E R? Then words? Like: AIDER? But note: D and I? New letters? But I is vowel? But we haven't tested? 

However, we must exclude C,N,T,S? So AIDER: A, I, D, E, R -> E is at position4? Then: position1: A? Then I at2, D at3, E at4, R at5? So AIDER? 

Similarly, other words: ASKER? But S is excluded? Cannot. ALTER? But T excluded? Cannot? We cannot use T? 

Similarly, for case2: R _ _ E A? Like: RULER? But R at1 and5? And U at2, L at3? But then E is position4? Pattern: R U L E R? But wait: RULER has R at positions 1 and 5? So R is repeated? And the word RULER is valid? 

But we have to consider duplicates? 

Now, feedback for guess2: we got E at position4 correct? And S not in word? 

So to test case1: we could guess a word that starts with A? And ends with R? And has E at position4? 

Similarly, case2: start with R? And A at position5? 

But also, we need to cover new letters? 

So let's brainstorm words:

For case1: A ? ? E R? 
Possible words: 
AIDER (A at1, I at2, D at3, E at4, R at5): letters I and D not tested? 
AGGER (double G? and note E? but G?): but not? Also, G? 
AMBER: M and B? 
ALTER: T excluded? 
APPER: double P? 
AIMER: I and M? 
So common: AIDER, AMBER, AIMER, etc.

But we excluded T and S? So AIDER is acceptable? But D and I: new? 

For case2: R ? ? E A? 
Examples: RACEA? Not? 
RIPEA? Not? 
RULER: R at1, U at2, L at3, E at4, R at5? But R at5? 
RUBEA? Not? 
RUMEA? Not? 
Common words: RUPEE? But E repeated? Position: R U P E E? So position5 is E? But we need position5 to be A? So not? 
Only words ending with A? 
So: RARER? R repeated? But has A? Pattern: R at1, A at2? But we can't have A at2? Because from guess2 we know A not at2? So pattern R _ _ E A: so position2 must be something else? 

So for R _ _ E A:
Position1: R, position5: A? And position2: new letter? 
Words: 
RODEO? But O? And E? Position E at4? But RODEO ends with O? Not? 
Rated? T excluded? 
Rabid: B? 
Rally: L? 
Radio: O? but no E? We must have E at position4? So the word must have E at position4? So pattern must be R * * E A? 

So: R _ _ E A? 
English words? 
Examples: RONEA? Not? 
ROTEA? But T excluded? 
ROMEA? 
RUBEA? Not? 
Actually, ""ROYEA"" (a plant genus) but very rare? 
More common? 
Possibly: RANEE? But R at1? A at2? But A at2: we know A cannot be at position2? So if we try RANEE: R at1, A at2, N? But N excluded? A at2? We already know A is not at2? So if we guess that, feedback would say A not at2? Which we know? 

So the word must not have A at position2? So we cannot use RANEE? 

Similarly, other words: ROKEE? Not? 
Actually, common words: I can't think of any at the moment? 

Perhaps RULER? But with A at5? We don't have A at5? 

Alternatively, we consider duplicate letters? 

But for simplicity? 

Given the constraints, it's more likely that case1 is the pattern? Because A _ _ E R? Words like AIDER are quite common? 

So we can guess a word that matches case1? 

But note: we don't know which? Case1 or case2? 

We can also try to test both options? But we have one guess? We can pick a word that tests the possible positions? 

Since we have limited positions: A can only be 1 or 5? Similarly R? So we can guess a word that has A at position1? If it is correct? We get feedback? 

But similarly, if we pick a word that doesn't commit to one case? 

But we know E at4? And we must use new letters? 

Let me try to pick? 

Idea: Guessing ""AIDER""? 
- A at position1? Which might be correct? 
- Also, introduces D and I? 
- Pattern: A I D E R? 
If pattern? 

But if case2 is true (R _ _ E A)? Then we miss? 

But in case2, we are having trouble finding words? 

Moreover, RULER? But that has A not? 

Perhaps ""REAVE""? But it doesn't end with A? 

So actually, common words for R _ _ E A? 

""Rare"" with E? No? 

""Ran?"": 

Actually, ""RAYEA"" is obscure? 

So perhaps case2 might not be? 

Therefore, it seems pattern A _ _ E R might be more likely? 

We can also note: from ""crane"": E was in the word? And E is also at position4? So? 

Moreover, we can choose a word that doesn't fix A at1 or R at5? But we need to? 

But we can place A at1? If not? Then we know? 

Similarly, we can place R at position1? 

But we have positions: 

Possible placements: 
Position1: either A or R? Because only these two? 
Position5: then the other? 

But we must fill positions 2 and 3? With new letters? So we have flexibility? 

So our next guess could be, for example, ""AIDER"" to test the case1? 

If we guess ""AIDER"": 
If pattern is case1: we may get A(✓) I(x?) etc? 
Or if not? Then A might be wrong? Meaning position1 is not A? So case2 might hold? 

Thus, we can use ""AIDER"" to test? 

Moreover, ""AIDER"" uses D and I? Common letters? 

Similarly, we could guess ""RIVER""? But R at1, I at2, V at3, E at4? Then R at5? But we don't have a fifth letter? If we put R at position5? That would be RIVER? But that's five letters? R I V E R? So positions: R at1? Then I at2, V at3, E at4? Then R at5? So pattern R I V E R? But what about A? A is not included? 

But the secret word must contain A? If we guess ""RIVER"", and if the secret word has A? Then we wouldn't get everything? 

So we must include A! Therefore, in any guess? We must have R, A, and E? 

Therefore, our next guess must include R, A, E? Because they are in the word? 

In ""AIDER"": A,I,D,E,R? So has A at1? R at5? So yes? Includes A, E and R? 

In case we guess case2? Like "" ???A"" that ends with A? But what word? RULER doesn't have A? 

So to include A if we guess for case2? We must have a word starting with R? and ending with A? And E at4? So word: R * * E A? 

But R _ _ E A? As above? 

One common word? ""Rotane""? Not five letter? ""Rotea""? Not word? 

Actually, ""ROSEA"" ? But S excluded? 

""ROWEA""? Not word? 

How about ""REJUA""? Not? 

It's difficult? So likely case2 pattern may not be? 

Therefore, I think it's safer to guess ""AIDER""? 

Moreover, it follows the constraints? 

Also, we test: 
Position1: A? If correct? 
Position2: I? 
Position3: D? 
Position4: E? 
Position5: R? 

Feedback will tell us:

If A is at1? Then we get ✓? Otherwise? If we get x or -? 

Similarly, R at5? 

We also test I and D? 

Now, if pattern is not as guessed? But at least we cover new consonants? 

Moreover, note how many words we have? 

So I will choose ""AIDER"". 

Alternative: ""AMBER""? With M and B? But same as? 

But ""AIDER"" is more common? 

Thus, guess: ""AIDER""Based on the feedback from both guesses:

- **C, N, T, S** are **excluded** (not in the secret word).
- **R, A, E** are **included**:
  - **E** is in **position 4** (confirmed ✓ from guess 2).
  - **A** cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback).
  - **R** cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback).
- Therefore, **A** must be in position **1 or 5**, and **R** must be in the **remaining position** (1 or 5), as positions 2 and 3 are now banned for both.
- The secret word has the pattern: `[A/R] ? ? E [R/A]`, with positions 2 and 3 filled by unknown letters (not C, N, T, S, and excluding A/R if no duplicates).

For this guess:
- I need to include **A, R, E** (since they are in the word).
- Prioritize testing **position 1** for **A or R** and **position 5** for the other.
- Introduce new frequent letters to cover more ground (e.g., I, D, L, M, O, U).

I selected **""AIDER""** because:
- It tests **A in position 1** and **R in position 5**, resolving the pattern uncertainty.
- It includes E in position 4 (correctly placed).
- It introduces **I (position 2)** and **D (position 3)**, covering common consonants and vowels.
- It adheres to all constraints and avoids excluded letters (C, N, T, S).

This guess efficiently narrows down the secret word by validating the likely pattern while gathering new letter information.

Since there\'s no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A strong starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to cover frequent letters.

It could be in other positions except 2. Similarly for A and E.\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and got \'-\')\n- A is in the word but not in position 3\n- E is in the word but not in position 5\n\nAlso, note that the word must contain R, A, E.\n\nNow, our new guess must:\n- Be a valid 5-letter word.\n- Include R, A, E (because they are in the secret word) and exclude C and N (and any other letters not present, but so far only C and N are excluded).\n- We also know that R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.\n\nOur goal is to test other positions for these letters and possibly introduce new common letters to gather more information.\n\nConsidering the above, let\'s think of words that have R, A, E.\n\nCommon consonants that might pair well: T, S, L, etc.\n\nWe also note that the secret word does not have C or N, so we avoid those.\n\nPotential words:\n- We might try a word that puts R, A, E in different positions than the first guess.\n\nIn ""crane"", positions:\n1: C (x) -> no C and not R? Actually, R could be at position 1? Wait, no: \nThe feedback for R says it is in the word but not in position 2. That does not prevent it from being in position 1? \nIn fact, in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and found incorrect for that position. So it could be in position 1? \nBut wait: the first letter was guessed as C and was wrong. We don\'t know if R is in position 1 until we try.\n\nHowever, we do know that position 1 cannot be C (since C is not in the word) and also cannot be R? No, we don\'t know that. \nWe haven\'t tested R in position 1 yet. So it\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly, position 3 cannot be A (because that\'s where A was in the first guess and it was wrongly placed), and position 5 cannot be E.\n\nLet\'s list banned positions for these letters:\n- R cannot be in position 2\n- A cannot be in position 3\n- E cannot be in position 5\n\nBut they can be in any other positions.\n\nFor our next guess, we want to place R, A, E in different positions to test and also use new letters to get more coverage.\n\nCommon letters left: T, L, S, D, M, etc.\n\nIdea: use a word that starts with a vowel or a consonant we haven\'t tried? But since position 1 was not C, we can try another consonant.\n\nMaybe ""IRATE""? But ""IRATE"" has I and T. \nBut note: we don\'t know about I and T yet.\n\nBut wait, ""IRATE"" uses I which we haven\'t tested. Also, what about positions?\n\nIn ""IRATE"":\n- Position 1: I\n- Position 2: R -> but we know R cannot be in position 2? From the feedback, R was tried at 2 and was wrong. So if we put R at position 2 again, we know it would be wrong? So it\'s useless to put R at position 2 again. Therefore, avoid that.\n\nSo in our next guess, avoid putting R at position 2, A at position 3, and E at position 5.\n\nWe should try R in positions other than 2: positions 1, 3, 4, 5? But position 5: we know E cannot be at position 5, but R could be.\n\nSimilarly, avoid A at position 3, so try it in 1,2,4,5? But note: position 5 has E issue? Not for A.\n\nWe have to place A, R, E in the word, but with restrictions.\n\nAlternative words:\n\nConsider ""RADIO"": but we cannot use O? No, we don\'t know about O. But we must use E? Because E is in the secret word. So the word must include E? Yes, because the feedback said E is in the word.\n\nSo the word must include E. Therefore ""RADIO"" doesn\'t have E, so invalid.\n\nWhat about ""ARISE""? \n- A in position 1? \n- R in position 2? But we cannot put R in position 2 because we know it cannot be there? We can, but we already know it\'s wrong so why waste? \n  Actually, if we put R in position 2, we will get feedback that it\'s wrong again? We know it\'s not there, so it doesn\'t help. Better to choose a word that tests R in a new position.\n\nIn ""ARISE"":\nPositions:\n1: A -> A was previously in position 3 (wrong) but here at position 1: we don\'t know if it can be at 1.\n2: R -> but we know R is not at position 2? So this will definitely get \'-\' for R? Which we already know. \nSo instead, let\'s avoid position 2 for R.\n\nBetter words: \n""REACT"": but has C? We know C is excluded. Cannot use C.\n\n""TARES"": \n- T (new), A (at position 2), R (at position 3), E (at position 4), S (new).\nBut we need to include A, R, E? Yes, but note:\nA: previously banned from position 3? Now we put it at 2? That\'s a new position, so it could be correct? \nSimilarly, R: banned from position 2? Now put at position 3? Could be correct? \nE: banned from position 5? Now at position 4? Could be correct.\n\nAlso, ""TARES"" avoids C and N and has S which is common.\n\nPossible word: ""TARES""\n\nBut we must ensure that we don\'t put the letters in the same banned positions? \nA is at position 2? Previously banned position for A is position 3? So position 2 is new? It\'s okay. \nR: previously banned position 2? Now at 3? Okay. \nE: previously banned position 5? Now at 4? Okay.\n\nMoreover, we get to test T and S.\n\nSo ""TARES"" seems reasonable.\n\nAnother option: ""STARE""?\nSimilar: \nS at 1, T at 2, A at 3? But wait: previously, A cannot be at position 3? Because it was at position 3 and got \'-\'. So we know A cannot be at position 3? \nSo if we put A at position 3 in ""STARE"", we know that will be wrong? Then why test it?\n\nActually, let\'s see positions for ""STARE"":\n1: S\n2: T\n3: A -> but we know from feedback that A is not in position 3 because when we guessed ""crane"", A was at 3 and not correct. So putting it again at 3 will get a \'-\' again? And we know that? \nSo it doesn\'t give new information? Worse, it uses up a slot without gaining new positional knowledge.\n\nTherefore, ""STARE"" is not efficient because we put A in a banned position.\n\nBut in ""TARES"":\n1: T (new)\n2: A (new position: was placed at 3 before, now at 2)\n3: R (new position: was placed at 2 before, now at 3)\n4: E (new position: was placed at 5 before, now at 4)\n5: S (new)\n\nThis tests new positions for R, A, E and introduces T and S.\n\nTherefore, ""TARES"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if A, R, or E are in these new positions? Exactly, so we test them.\n\nAlso, ""TARES"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother possibility: ""LATER""\n- L (new), A at 2, T (new), E at 4, R at 5? \nBut R at 5: which is new? \nSimilarly, ""LATER"" has L instead of S? But both are common.\n\nBut still, ""LATER"" doesn\'t meet all? We have all three A, R, E? Yes.\n\nHowever, I think it\'s better to cover as many frequent letters as possible. T and S are very common.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""TARES"".\n\nSummary of what we test:\n- T in position 1\n- A in position 2 (new position)\n- R in position 3 (new position for R; previously tried at 2)\n- E in position 4 (new position; previously at 5)\n- S in position 5\n\nExpected feedback possibilities will tell us:\nIf T is in the word and where, similarly for S, and the correctness of A, R, E in new positions.\n\nSo, I choose ""TARES"".\n\nBut wait, we also have the possibility that the word might have repeated letters? But we haven\'t encountered any yet? And ""TARES"" has all unique? \n\nYes, ""TARES"" is all unique.\n\nThus, the next guess: TARES.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C and N are **excluded** (not in the secret word).  \n- R, A, and E are **included** but **incorrectly positioned**:  \n  - R is not in position 2.  \n  - A is not in position 3.  \n  - E is not in position 5.  \n\nFor the next guess, I need:  \n- A valid 5-letter word containing R, A, and E (since they are in the secret word).  \n- Avoid C and N completely.  \n- Test R, A, and E in **new positions** (not position 2 for R, not position 3 for A, not position 5 for E).  \n- Use frequent consonants like T or S for maximum coverage.  \n\nI selected **""TARES""** because:  \n- It includes all required letters: R, A, E.  \n- Positions avoid previous mistakes:  \n  - R is in position 3 (not tested position 2, now testing position 3).  \n  - A is in position 2 (not tested position 3, now testing position 2).  \n  - E is in position 4 (not tested position 5, now testing position 4).  \n- It introduces new common consonants: T (position 1) and S (position 5), providing broader letter coverage.  \n- It’s a valid English word (""tare"" meaning to adjust or align, or plural ""tares"").  \n\nThis guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and explores new letters (T, S) while respecting the constraints.\n\n<guess>tares</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) R(-) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane\nFeedback: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nInterpretation:\n- C: not in the secret word.\n- R: in the word, but not in position 2.\n- A: in the word, but not in position 3.\n- N: not in the secret word.\n- E: in the word, but not in position 5.\n\nSecret word contains: R, A, E.\nExcludes: C, N.\n\nGuess 2: tares\nFeedback: T(x) A(-) R(-) E(✓) S(x)\nInterpretation:\n- T: not in the secret word.\n- A: in the word, but not in position 2 (this guess had A at position 2).\n- R: in the word, but not in position 3 (this guess had R at position 3).\n- E: correct, meaning it is in position 4 (because feedback shows E(✓) at position 4 of tares).\n- S: not in the secret word.\n\nTherefore, combining all known information:\n- Letters in the secret word: R, A, E (and E is fixed in position 4).\n- Excluded letters: C, N, T, S.\n- Known positions:\n  - Position 4: E (from guess 2 feedback).\n\nAlso, we know:\n- From guess1: A is not in position 3, R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5 (but now E is fixed at position 4).\n- From guess2: A is not in position 2 (because we guessed A at position 2 and got \'-\'), R is not in position 3 (we guessed R at position 3 and got \'-\').\n\nSo current position constraints:\n- Position 2: cannot be A (from guess2), and cannot be R? (From guess1: R is not in position 2, but that was already known. Now from guess2 we don\'t have new info for position2 regarding R? Because in guess2, position2 was A. So R can still be in other positions).\nBut specifically:\n  - A cannot be at: position 2 (guess2), position 3 (guess1)\n  - R cannot be at: position 2 (guess1), position 3 (guess2)\n\nSince E is fixed at position 4, we have:\n\nSecret word pattern: _ _ _ E _\n\nLetters we know are in: A, R, plus two more letters? Wait: we have only 5 letters. We know 3: A, R, E. So two more letters to be guessed? But we don\'t know them yet? Or actually, the secret word might have repeated letters? But in the feedback, we haven\'t seen duplicates? But it\'s possible? We should avoid assuming.\n\nBut note: in the feedback, we have excluded C, N, T, S. So the remaining letters could be any 5-letter word containing A, R, E, excluding C, N, T, S, and probably other letters already tried? Actually, we only know these exclusions.\n\nNow, which letters are available? All English letters except C, N, T, S? We don\'t know about others? For example, we haven\'t tested B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? And among vowels, we have A (in), and E (in), but not O, I, U? Or Y?\n\nWe also know the word must include two more letters (since only three known: A,R,E). Actually, we have E at position4, so we need to find the remaining four positions? No: the word has five positions. We have one fixed: position4 is E. So we need the other positions: 1,2,3,5.\n\nAnd we know A and R are in the word, so they must be placed in positions 1,2,3,5? But with constraints: A cannot be in position2 or3? And R cannot be in position2 or3? And E is at4? So positions for A: only positions 1 or 5? Similarly for R: only positions 1,4? But position4 is E? So R cannot be at4? So R must be in position 1 or 5? And A must be in position 1 or 5? \n\nBut wait: the word might have more than one E? Then R or A could be elsewhere? We don\'t know? So we cannot be sure?\n\nBut let\'s lay it out:\n\nAvailable positions: 1,2,3,5 (since 4 is E).\n\nWe must place A and R in two of these? But the word might have duplicates? For now, let\'s assume no duplicates? Because we haven\'t encountered feedback? But it\'s possible? We have to consider?\n\nBut in the feedback so far, no indication of duplicates? However, we can\'t rule out? Since we haven\'t guessed any duplicate letters.\n\nBut without information, we start without assuming duplicates? We can revise if later.\n\nSo for now, assume A, R are each once? Then:\n\nA can be only in position 1 or 5? Because it cannot be in 2 (from guess2) or in 3 (from guess1). Similarly, R cannot be in position 2 (from guess1) or in position3 (from guess2). And E is at4? So R and A must be in positions 1,5? But there is also position 5? Then we have:\n\nPositions: 1,2,3,5? We have to fill all? And we know that A and R must be placed? And we have two extra letters? For positions 2 and 3? And for the remaining spots? Actually: positions 1,2,3,5 remain? And two letters? So we need two more letters? And we place A and R in two positions? And the others are different letters?\n\nSo: positions 1,2,3,5 available? And among them, two spots must be filled by A and R? But A must be at 1 or 5? R must be at 1 or 5? But we have two positions 1 and 5? And A and R? So:\n\nOption1: position 1: A, position 5: R? Or\nOption2: position 1: R, position 5: A? \n\nBut also: we must fill positions 2 and 3? With two other letters? Not A or R? Because if A and R are at 1 and5, then positions 2 and 3 must be two new letters? \n\nTherefore, the secret word pattern:\nIf A at1, then: A _ _ E R\nIf R at1, then: R _ _ E A\nand positions 2 and 3: two new letters? \n\nBut wait: note we have constraints:\nIn option1: A at1? But from guess2: we guessed T at position1? But E is at position4? So we don\'t know about position1 having others? \n\nHowever, let\'s formalize:\n\nCase1: A in position1, R in position5: so word: A ?? E R? Pattern: A _ _ E R\n\nCase2: R in position1, A in position5: so word: R ?? E A? Pattern: R _ _ E A\n\nNow, we must also include that E is fixed at4? And positions 2 and 3: two other letters? Which cannot be C,N,T,S? And also cannot be A or R? Because we are placing A/R at 1/5? \n\nBut could a word have repeated letters? Yes? For example, A might appear twice? But we haven\'t seen any indication? We have to keep in mind?\n\nBut without evidence, we proceed? And then? \n\nAlso, we know from guess1: E is not in position5? Which is consistent because we put in position1 or5? And E is at4? \n\nNow, we need to guess a word that fits either pattern? And to maximize coverage? \n\nBut in the next guess, we can choose a word that has many common letters? \n\nFor example, for case1 pattern: A _ _ E R? Then words? Like: AIDER? But note: D and I? New letters? But I is vowel? But we haven\'t tested? \n\nHowever, we must exclude C,N,T,S? So AIDER: A, I, D, E, R -> E is at position4? Then: position1: A? Then I at2, D at3, E at4, R at5? So AIDER? \n\nSimilarly, other words: ASKER? But S is excluded? Cannot. ALTER? But T excluded? Cannot? We cannot use T? \n\nSimilarly, for case2: R _ _ E A? Like: RULER? But R at1 and5? And U at2, L at3? But then E is position4? Pattern: R U L E R? But wait: RULER has R at positions 1 and 5? So R is repeated? And the word RULER is valid? \n\nBut we have to consider duplicates? \n\nNow, feedback for guess2: we got E at position4 correct? And S not in word? \n\nSo to test case1: we could guess a word that starts with A? And ends with R? And has E at position4? \n\nSimilarly, case2: start with R? And A at position5? \n\nBut also, we need to cover new letters? \n\nSo let\'s brainstorm words:\n\nFor case1: A ? ? E R? \nPossible words: \nAIDER (A at1, I at2, D at3, E at4, R at5): letters I and D not tested? \nAGGER (double G? and note E? but G?): but not? Also, G? \nAMBER: M and B? \nALTER: T excluded? \nAPPER: double P? \nAIMER: I and M? \nSo common: AIDER, AMBER, AIMER, etc.\n\nBut we excluded T and S? So AIDER is acceptable? But D and I: new? \n\nFor case2: R ? ? E A? \nExamples: RACEA? Not? \nRIPEA? Not? \nRULER: R at1, U at2, L at3, E at4, R at5? But R at5? \nRUBEA? Not? \nRUMEA? Not? \nCommon words: RUPEE? But E repeated? Position: R U P E E? So position5 is E? But we need position5 to be A? So not? \nOnly words ending with A? \nSo: RARER? R repeated? But has A? Pattern: R at1, A at2? But we can\'t have A at2? Because from guess2 we know A not at2? So pattern R _ _ E A: so position2 must be something else? \n\nSo for R _ _ E A:\nPosition1: R, position5: A? And position2: new letter? \nWords: \nRODEO? But O? And E? Position E at4? But RODEO ends with O? Not? \nRated? T excluded? \nRabid: B? \nRally: L? \nRadio: O? but no E? We must have E at position4? So the word must have E at position4? So pattern must be R * * E A? \n\nSo: R _ _ E A? \nEnglish words? \nExamples: RONEA? Not? \nROTEA? But T excluded? \nROMEA? \nRUBEA? Not? \nActually, ""ROYEA"" (a plant genus) but very rare? \nMore common? \nPossibly: RANEE? But R at1? A at2? But A at2: we know A cannot be at position2? So if we try RANEE: R at1, A at2, N? But N excluded? A at2? We already know A is not at2? So if we guess that, feedback would say A not at2? Which we know? \n\nSo the word must not have A at position2? So we cannot use RANEE? \n\nSimilarly, other words: ROKEE? Not? \nActually, common words: I can\'t think of any at the moment? \n\nPerhaps RULER? But with A at5? We don\'t have A at5? \n\nAlternatively, we consider duplicate letters? \n\nBut for simplicity? \n\nGiven the constraints, it\'s more likely that case1 is the pattern? Because A _ _ E R? Words like AIDER are quite common? \n\nSo we can guess a word that matches case1? \n\nBut note: we don\'t know which? Case1 or case2? \n\nWe can also try to test both options? But we have one guess? We can pick a word that tests the possible positions? \n\nSince we have limited positions: A can only be 1 or 5? Similarly R? So we can guess a word that has A at position1? If it is correct? We get feedback? \n\nBut similarly, if we pick a word that doesn\'t commit to one case? \n\nBut we know E at4? And we must use new letters? \n\nLet me try to pick? \n\nIdea: Guessing ""AIDER""? \n- A at position1? Which might be correct? \n- Also, introduces D and I? \n- Pattern: A I D E R? \nIf pattern? \n\nBut if case2 is true (R _ _ E A)? Then we miss? \n\nBut in case2, we are having trouble finding words? \n\nMoreover, RULER? But that has A not? \n\nPerhaps ""REAVE""? But it doesn\'t end with A? \n\nSo actually, common words for R _ _ E A? \n\n""Rare"" with E? No? \n\n""Ran?"": \n\nActually, ""RAYEA"" is obscure? \n\nSo perhaps case2 might not be? \n\nTherefore, it seems pattern A _ _ E R might be more likely? \n\nWe can also note: from ""crane"": E was in the word? And E is also at position4? So? \n\nMoreover, we can choose a word that doesn\'t fix A at1 or R at5? But we need to? \n\nBut we can place A at1? If not? Then we know? \n\nSimilarly, we can place R at position1? \n\nBut we have positions: \n\nPossible placements: \nPosition1: either A or R? Because only these two? \nPosition5: then the other? \n\nBut we must fill positions 2 and 3? With new letters? So we have flexibility? \n\nSo our next guess could be, for example, ""AIDER"" to test the case1? \n\nIf we guess ""AIDER"": \nIf pattern is case1: we may get A(✓) I(x?) etc? \nOr if not?

Common letters? \n\nSimilarly, we could guess ""RIVER""? But R at1, I at2, V at3, E at4? Then R at5? But we don\'t have a fifth letter? If we put R at position5? That would be RIVER? But that\'s five letters? R I V E R? So positions: R at1? Then I at2, V at3, E at4? Then R at5? So pattern R I V E R? But what about A? A is not included? \n\nBut the secret word must contain A? If we guess ""RIVER"", and if the secret word has A? Then we wouldn\'t get everything? \n\nSo we must include A! Therefore, in any guess?

We have feedback from Guess 3: aider -> A(✓) I(x) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)

Interpretation:
- A is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- I is not in the secret word (x).
- D is not in the secret word (x).
- E is correct and in position 4 (✓). We already knew E was fixed at position 4.
- R is correct and in position 5 (✓).

Therefore, from this feedback:
- Position 1: A (correct, so secret word starts with A).
- Position 5: R (correct, so secret word ends with R).
- Position 4: E (correct).
- I and D are excluded (not in the word).

Combined with prior exclusions: C, N, T, S, I, D are out.

Now we know the secret word starts with A, ends with R, and has E at position 4. 
So the pattern is: A ? ? E R

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters that:
- Are not C, N, T, S, I, D (excluded).
- And must form a valid English word.

Letters we know are in the word: A, E, R are already placed. 
But we have two positions (2 and 3) to fill, so the word must have two more unique letters (unless duplicates, but no indication yet).

From previous feedback, we knew A and R were in the word, and E at position 4? Now positions 1 and 5 are fixed? So for positions 2 and 3: two new letters.

Let's list all letters that are not excluded:
Excluded: C, N, T, S, I, D. And from guess2: T and S excluded? Guess1: C,N excluded? Guess3: I,D excluded?
So excluded letters: C, D, I, N, T, S.

We are missing: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? And vowels: A and E are used? But could they repeat? Possible? Without evidence? 

But note: we have no feedback so far suggesting duplicates? And in our guesses, we didn't repeat letters? So we assume no duplicates? But secret word might have duplicate? However, we can test.

But for now? We need a word: A ? ? E R? With ? being letters not excluded? And must form a valid word.

Possible words:

Examples: 
- ALTER: has T? But T is excluded? Cannot use T? 
- AMBER: has M? And B? Both not excluded? But E at position4? A M B E R? Positions: A at1, M at2, B at3, E at4, R at5? So ""amber"" fits the pattern? 
- APPER: has P? But P? But note: ""APPER"" is not common? Also? 
- AGGER: G? 
- ALLER: L? 
- ABLER: B,L? 
- AWFER? Not? 
- Better: amber, alter(but T), apron(O? and E? But apron: A P R O N? Then E missing? But we have E at4? So no? 
We need E at position4? So word must have E at position4? 

Therefore, candidate words: 
- AMBER: A, M, B, E, R? Positions: A(1), M(2), B(3), E(4), R(5)? Valid?
- AGER? Not 5 letter? 
- ALTER? T excluded? 
- AKER? Not common? 
- ABLER: A, B, L, E, R? Pattern: A B L E R? So position2:B? position3:L? Then E at4? R at5? ""ABLER"" is a word? Yes? 
- AIMER? I excluded? Cannot? 
- AGREE? Has E repeated? But pattern: A G R E E? Then position5 should be R? But here E? So not? 
- ALDER? D excluded? Cannot? 
- AMEL? Not? 
Another word: AMBER and ABLER seem candidates? 

What about ""ALIKE""? But E at position5? Not? 
""ALONE""? But E at5? 
We must have E at position4? 

More possibilities: 
""ANGER"": but N excluded? 
""ARMER"": R repeated? And M? But pattern: A R M E R? Then R at position1? But we have A at1? Position2:R, position3:M, E at4, R at5? So but N excluded? Actually? ""ARMER"" is not word? 
Better: ""AMPER""? P? But ""AMPER"" is a unit? Sometimes? But not common? 

Common words: Amber, Abler, and also ""APTER""? T excluded? 
""AVERT"": but T? Also, E at position4: A V E R T? Then position4 is E? But position3? E? Not? A V ? E T? Doesn't match A ? ? E R? 
Avert: A V E R T? Positions: A(1), V(2), E(3)? But we have E at position4? Not. 

So candidate real words: Amber and Abler? 

But also: ""AFEAR""? Not? 
""AGGER""? A, G, G, E, R? Then duplicates? Possible? Pattern A G G E R? So position2:G, position3:G? 
But is ""AGGER"" a word? In geography? 

Similarly, ""AMMER""? M? Not? 

Therefore, the most common words seem to be ""amber"" and ""abler"". 

Now, we can choose either? And get feedback? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests a letter that appears in both? But let's see: 

We have two positions? And we need to cover possibilities? 

But we have only two candidates? And we have 6 tries? So we can guess one? 

For example, guess ""amber""? If it? 

But moreover? We don't have information about position2 and3? 

But we can also introduce other letters? 

Since we already have two plausible words? We can choose ""amber"" first? 

To optimize? We might consider words that include letters that are frequent and could rule out many? 

But here? We have fixed pattern A _ _ E R? 

So we choose ""amber"" to test M and B? 

Similarly? 

I think ""amber"" is a common word? So I'll go with ""amber"". 

Thus, next guess: amber. 

But note: we have not tested any words with O? Or U? Etc? But we can? However, ""amber"" uses M and B? Both common? 

Also, ""ABLER"" uses B and L? 

But both share B? So perhaps we test a word that doesn't have B? But we don't know? 

Therefore? Guess ""amber"". 

Alternative: ""ABLER""? 

But ""amber"" is more familiar? 

So I choose ""amber"".Based on the cumulative feedback:

- **Fixed letters**: 
  - Position 1: A (✓) 
  - Position 4: E (✓) 
  - Position 5: R (✓)  
- **Excluded letters**: C, D, I, N, T, S  
- **Pattern**: The secret word is **A ? ? E R**  
- Positions 2 and 3 need unique, non-excluded letters (e.g., B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Possible words fitting the pattern include **AMBER** (A-M-B-E-R) and **ABLER** (A-B-L-E-R).  

I selected **""AMBER""** because:  
- It tests **M in position 2** and **B in position 3**, introducing new common letters.  
- It is a commonplace English word (validating it as a guess).  
- If incorrect, it instantly informs us about M/B presence and positions—narrowing down remaining options (e.g., toward ABLER or others like AGGER).  

This guess efficiently resolves uncertainty by covering a frequent, plausible candidate.

Based on the previous feedback, we now know:

- **A** is in position 1 (✓).
- **R** is in position 5 (✓).
- **E** is in position 4 (✓).
- **Excluded letters**: C, D, I, N, T, S (all marked with ""x"" across guesses).
- The word pattern is fixed as: **A _ _ E R**.

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters not excluded (e.g., B, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.). Common words fitting this pattern are:
- **AMBER** (if positions 2 and 3 are M and B).
- **ABLER** (if positions 2 and 3 are B and L).

I chose **amber** to test **M** in position 2 and **B** in position 3. Introducing these letters provides broad coverage for future guesses:
- If ""amber"" is incorrect, we learn about the presence/absence of M and B and their positions to refine toward alternatives (e.g., ABLER, AGGER).

This guess resolves the ambiguity efficiently.

<guess>amber</guess>",amber,"We have feedback from Guess 3: aider -> A(✓) I(x) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)

Interpretation:
- A is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- I is not in the secret word (x).
- D is not in the secret word (x).
- E is correct and in position 4 (✓). We already knew E was fixed at position 4.

- Position 4: E (correct).
- I and D are excluded (not in the word).

So excluded letters: C, D, I, N, T, S.

We are missing: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? And vowels: A and E are used? But could they repeat? Possible? Without evidence?

Therefore, candidate words:
