We are making the first guess. Since we have no information yet, we should choose a word that has common letters and a good distribution to maximize information.
 Common vowels and consonants: A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N.
 A good starting word might be ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"", but let me pick one that is widely used.

 However, note that the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

 I recall that ""ROATE"" (which is an anagram of ORATE) is a popular starting word because it contains common letters and has been studied to have good properties. But let's use a more traditional one.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E — which are common.

 But note: the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", which are also common.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good candidate because it has S, L, A, T, E.

 Considering the feedback format, it would be beneficial to have as many common letters as possible and avoid repetitions.

 After some thought, I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 Remember: The goal of the first guess is to gather information about which letters are present and their positions.

 Let me check if ""CRANE"" is valid: yes, it is a word (meaning a large long-necked bird).

 So, I'll guess: CRANE

</think>
I am making my first guess without any prior information. For a strong starting word in Wordle, I need a word with common letters to maximize information from the feedback. Letters like vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S, T) are statistically optimal. 

A powerful first guess is **""CRANE""** because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- It covers over 50% of letters found in English 5-letter words on average.
- It has no repeating letters, ensuring each guess position tests a unique character.

This will provide immediate feedback on:
- Which of these common letters are present/absent.
- Whether any are in the correct positions.
- Giving a solid foundation for narrowing down the secret word.

We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> all letters are marked as 'x' meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 For the next guess:
 - We must avoid using any of C, R, A, N, E.
 - We should choose a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting other letters in the secret word.

 Common English letters (excluding C, R, A, N, E) include: S, T, O, L, I, D, M, P, etc.

 Since the word must be 5 letters and valid, we can try a word with as many of the remaining common letters as possible.

 For example, let's consider:
   S, T, O, L, I

 A good candidate might be ""SLOTH"", but note that we haven't checked frequency. Another common starting word that avoids these letters is ""PILOT"", but let's check:

 Possibilities:
   ""STOMP"" - includes S, T, O, M, P -> common letters, but note O and T are very common.
   ""MOIST"" - includes M, O, I, S, T -> all common and avoids the excluded set.

 However, we must ensure we don't use C, R, A, N, E.

 Considering ""MOIST"":
   M: not excluded -> okay
   O: not excluded -> okay
   I: not excluded -> okay
   S: not excluded -> okay
   T: not excluded -> okay

 Therefore, ""MOIST"" is a valid choice.

 Another alternative: ""PLUMP"" has repeating P and U is less common, so not ideal. ""SHIELD"" is 6 letters. So 5-letter words: 
   ""TOILS"", ""STOMP"", ""PIOUS"", etc., but ""MOIST"" seems strong.

 Let me confirm that ""MOIST"" is a valid English word: yes, meaning slightly wet.

 With ""MOIST"", we can get feedback on S, T, O, M, I.

 Let's choose ""MOIST"".

 But note: the feedback in the example used two guesses without repeating any letters, and that is a good strategy to get more information.

 Since we eliminated 5 common letters, we can focus on other letters.

 Alternatively, we might include U? But U is less common than O, I, S, T.

 Therefore, I will go with ""MOIST"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess **CRANE**, where **all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗)**, we know the secret word contains none of these letters. For the next guess:
- We need a word using entirely different, common letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, A, N, E).
- Ideal candidates include high-frequency consonants like **S, T, L, M**, and vowels like **O, I, U** (since E and A are ruled out).
- **""MOIST""** fits perfectly: it uses common letters (M, O, I, S, T), avoids the excluded set, and maximizes the chance of partial matches.

This guess will test new letters (M, O, I, S, T), helping narrow down possibilities based on position and presence.

Letters like vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S, T) are statistically optimal. \n\nA powerful first guess is **""CRANE""** because:\n- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).\n- It covers over 50% of letters found in English 5-letter words on average.\n- It has no repeating letters, ensuring each guess position tests a unique character.\n\nThis will provide immediate feedback on:\n- Which of these common letters are present/absent.\n- Whether any are in the correct positions.\n- Giving a solid foundation for narrowing down the secret word.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> all letters are marked as \'x\' meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.\n Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n For the next guess:\n - We must avoid using any of C, R, A, N, E.\n - We should choose a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting other letters in the secret word.\n\n Common English letters (excluding C, R, A, N, E) include: S, T, O, L, I, D, M, P, etc.\n\n Since the word must be 5 letters and valid, we can try a word with as many of the remaining common letters as possible.\n\n For example, let\'s consider:\n   S, T, O, L, I\n\n A good candidate might be ""SLOTH"", but note that we haven\'t checked frequency. Another common starting word that avoids these letters is ""PILOT"", but let\'s check:\n\n Possibilities:\n   ""STOMP"" - includes S, T, O, M, P -> common letters, but note O and T are very common.\n   ""MOIST"" - includes M, O, I, S, T -> all common and avoids the excluded set.\n\n However, we must ensure we don\'t use C, R, A, N, E.\n\n Considering ""MOIST"":\n   M: not excluded -> okay\n   O: not excluded -> okay\n   I: not excluded -> okay\n   S: not excluded -> okay\n   T: not excluded -> okay\n\n Therefore, ""MOIST"" is a valid choice.\n\n Another alternative: ""PLUMP"" has repeating P and U is less common, so not ideal. ""SHIELD"" is 6 letters. So 5-letter words: \n   ""TOILS"", ""STOMP"", ""PIOUS"", etc., but ""MOIST"" seems strong.\n\n Let me confirm that ""MOIST"" is a valid English word: yes, meaning slightly wet.\n\n With ""MOIST"", we can get feedback on S, T, O, M, I.\n\n Let\'s choose ""MOIST"".\n\n But note: the feedback in the example used two guesses without repeating any letters, and that is a good strategy to get more information.\n\n Since we eliminated 5 common letters, we can focus on other letters.\n\n Alternatively, we might include U? But U is less common than O, I, S, T.\n\n Therefore, I will go with ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess **CRANE**, where **all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗)**, we know the secret word contains none of these letters. For the next guess:\n- We need a word using entirely different, common letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, A, N, E).\n- Ideal candidates include high-frequency consonants like **S, T, L, M**, and vowels like **O, I, U** (since E and A are ruled out).\n- **""MOIST""** fits perfectly: it uses common letters (M, O, I, S, T), avoids the excluded set, and maximizes the chance of partial matches.\n\nThis guess will test new letters (M, O, I, S, T), helping narrow down possibilities based on position and presence.\n\n<guess>MOIST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:
- Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
- Guess 2 (MOIST): Feedback is M(✓) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x). Breaking this down:
  - M is correct and in the correct position (position 1). So the secret word starts with M.
  - O is absent (x). So O is not in the word at all? But note: We had O in position 2, and it's absent. Since the feedback says ""x"" for O, it means O is not present anywhere in the secret word.
  - I is absent (x). So I is not in the word.
  - S is present but in the wrong position (-). So S is in the word, but not in position 4 (since we placed it at position 4 in MOIST).
  - T is absent (x). So T is not in the word.

Therefore, so far:
- The word starts with M.
- It contains the letter S, but not in position 4 (where we guessed it).
- It does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, T.

Also, from the first guess, we know the word has no C, R, A, N, E. So overall, excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, T.

Now, for the next guess:
- We know the first letter is M (correct and in position).
- We know S is in the word, but not in position 4.
- For positions 2, 3, 4, and 5, we must use letters that are not in the excluded set and try to include S in a position other than 4.

Available letters: Most of the alphabet minus excluded. Excluded: A, C, E, I, N, O, R, T. 

So available letters (among common ones): B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Also S is included, but we already know S is present.

Since S must be placed somewhere, we should try a word that has S not in position 4 and with M at the start.

We have positions:
1: M (fixed)
2: ? (must be from available letters, excluding O and I and T and the other excluded ones)
3: ?
4: ? (but cannot be S because we know from feedback that in position 4 it wasn't S; also in our guess, position 4 was S and it was wrong position, so S is not at position 4)
5: ?

We must include S somewhere in one of the positions 2,3,5 (since it can be in position 2,3, or 5 as long as not position 4). But note: when we say not position 4, that doesn't prevent positions 2,3,5.

For position 4, note that in our next guesses, we shouldn't put S there again because we know it's not there? Yes, because the feedback told us S is in the word but not at position 4.

We need to choose a valid 5-letter word that starts with M and has S in one of the positions 2,3, or 5 (but not 4). Also, we must not use any excluded letters.

Possible common letters to try: We haven't tested L, D, U, G, H, K, P, etc.

The word should include S. So let's think of words starting with M and containing S.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""MUSIC"": But I is excluded (from MOIST feedback, I is absent). So not allowed.
- ""MASKS"": But A and K? A is excluded (from CRANE), so A is not allowed; K is available? But ""MASKS"" has A and S at position 2 and 5? Let's not consider because A is excluded.

We must avoid A.

Another word: ""MUSHY"": But H and Y? Let's check:
  M U S H Y -> U and H and Y are available? But we don't know if they are present. Also, S is at position 3.

That might be a candidate. But let's see if we can think of more.

Another possibility: ""MOSSY"": But O is excluded? Yes, O is excluded from feedback. So O not allowed.

Another: ""MISSY"": But I is excluded. So no.

We must avoid I as well.

How about ""MANGO""? But A is excluded and O is excluded.

We need words using letters from the available set: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and S (but S is already known present).

Also, we don't know what other letters are in the word. We might try to include new letters to test.

Let's list words starting with M and containing S (but not at position 4), and using only available letters.

Candidate: ""MUSKY"": Meaning, having the odor of musk. 
  M U S K Y -> Letters: U, S, K, Y (and M at start). Available letters? 
  Check excluded: U, S, K, Y none are in the excluded list. Also, we can place S at position 3? And avoid position 4.

But note: S is at position 3? That's allowed because in MOIST we had S at position 4 and incorrect. Now, position 3 is not position 4, so if S is there, it would be marked as ""-"" if it's in the word but wrong position? Actually, if S is in position 3 and in the secret word at position 3, we'd get ""✓"", but if at a different position, then ""-"".

We don't know the position of S yet. We only know it's not position 4.

Also, we don't know if U, K, Y are present? So ""MUSKY"" would test U at position 2, S at position 3, K at position 4, Y at position 5.

But note: position 4 we are putting K? That's okay because we don't have information about position 4.

Another candidate: ""MUSSY"": But that has two S's? And we are not sure if the word has two S's? But it might. However, ""MUSSY"" has U and Y. Also, S at positions 3 and 4? Position 4 is S again? But we know S is not at position 4? So we shouldn't put S at position 4 again? Actually, we shouldn't put S at position 4 again because we know it's not there. So ""MUSSY"" would be putting S in position 4 again, which we should avoid? The rules don't require we avoid, but it would be wasteful. Also, if we put S in position 4 again, the feedback would say ""-"" if S is in the word elsewhere? Actually, we know it's not in position 4, so we avoid.

Better not to put S at position 4 again.

So ""MUSKY"" places S at position 3 and avoids position 4.

Another candidate: ""MASHY"" but A is excluded -> invalid.

Another: ""MULSH"" - not a word.

Another: ""MUSTY"": Meaning stale. 
  M U S T Y -> But T is excluded? From MOIST feedback, T was absent. So T is excluded? Yes, from Guess 2: T was marked absent? In MOIST feedback: T(x) -> so T is not in the word. Therefore ""MUSTY"" has T -> invalid.

Another: ""MUSED"": But E is excluded? From CRANE feedback, E is absent -> invalid.

We can't use E.

Another: ""MOUSY"": O is excluded -> invalid.

Let me think: Words starting with M, containing S, with no excluded letters and S not at position 4.

Try ""MYSID"": Not a common word.

Common words: What about ""MAPES""? Not a word.

Better: ""MUSKY"" is valid. 
- M at 1: we know is ok.
- U at 2?
- S at 3? 
- K at 4? 
- Y at 5.

Another candidate: ""MASHED"": But A and E and D? A and E are excluded -> invalid.

""WIMPS"": Doesn't start with M.

We need M at first.

Another: ""MILDS"": But I and L? I is excluded -> invalid.

How about ""MULES"": But E -> excluded.

We are having trouble finding words. 

Another idea: ""SHOWY""? Doesn't start with M.

Focus: M _ _ _ _ and must include S in one of the last three positions? But positions 2,3,5? Alternatively, position 5.

What about ""MUCKS""? K and S? But S is at position 5? That would work. 
- M U C K S -> But C is excluded? From CRANE feedback, C is absent -> invalid.

C is excluded.

So ""MUCKS"" invalid because of C.

""BUMFS""?? Not a word.

Consider ""MUGGS"": Two Gs? But G is available? 
But we don't have S? ""MUGGS"" has no S? But we have to include S? Not necessarily? Wait, no: the feedback says S is in the word? So we must include S? Therefore, we cannot make a guess without S? We already know S is in the secret word? Actually, from Guess 2 feedback: S was marked as ""-"", meaning S is in the word. So any valid guess must include S? Or doesn't have to? Actually, we must include S because it's present? But we don't have to? It might be helpful to test other letters, but since we know S is in the word, we should use it to discover its location?

But the rules: We can guess any valid 5-letter word, but if we guess without S, then we are missing an opportunity to get information about S? And also, a good guess would include the known letter S to find its position.

Moreover, the word we guess must be a valid word that could be the secret word? Not necessarily, but it must be a valid English word.

So we must include S? Otherwise, we might get false negatives? Actually, we are not required to include S, but if we don't, we might not get information about S's position.

Also, the word must start with M (we know that). So we need a word starting with M and including S (since S is present, it's better to include).

Therefore, continue to find a word that starts with M, contains S (but not at position 4), and uses available letters.

Try ""MYTHS"": Meaning plural of myth. 
  M Y T H S -> But T is excluded? From MOIST feedback T(x) -> T is absent. So T is excluded -> invalid.

""SHULS"": But doesn't start with M.

Another: ""MULCH"": But C and H? C is excluded -> invalid.

Consider: ""MUHLY"" - a grass? But does it have S? No.

Not including S. We need to include S.

What about ""MUSSY""? I mentioned it earlier, but it has two S's? And we put S at position 4? But we know S is not at position 4? So should avoid.

Word: ""MUMSY"": Meaning drab? But U and M and S and Y? Letters: M,U,M,S,Y -> M at position 1 and 2? Position 2 would be U? But then S is at position 4 -> we know S is not at position 4? So ""MUMSY"" has S at position 4.

Guess: M U M S Y -> position 4 is S, which we know is wrong. So we expect the feedback to say S is present but not position 4? Which we already know. That doesn't give new information? But at least we test U, M (again?) and Y.

But M is already at position 1, so position 2 M is a guess? It might be redundant? Also, the secret word has M at position 1? So any extra M might be overcounted.

Moreover, the secret word might have double letters? We don't know? So possible? But ""MUSSY"" or ""MUMSY"" might be valid?

But ""MUMSY"" does not have the letters? It has M at position 1: we know ✓, then position 2: U, position 3: M (so testing M? but M already at 1? Then S at 4: which we know is not, and Y at 5.

But we are not supposed to put S at position 4? Actually, we can put it? The feedback would help if S is at 4? But we already know it's not? So the feedback will say ""-"" for S regardless of whether we put it at position 4? Because we know S is somewhere else? How does the feedback give information? If we put S at position 4 in a guess, then we know:
- If the feedback says ""-"" for that S, it means S is in the word but not at position 4? And we already know that? It doesn't tell us anything new? So waste of a guess? If the feedback says ""x"" for that S, that would be contradictory? Because we know S is present? So it can't say ""x"". So it must say ""-"", so no new information? Hence, avoid putting S in a position we already know it's not.

Thus, for position 4, we know it's not S, so we shouldn't put S there again.

Similarly, avoid putting S in any other position that we have already tried and gotten wrong? But we've only tried position 4? So positions 2,3,5 are untested.

Therefore, put S in position 2, 3, or 5.

Now back to finding words.

Let me try ""MUSHY"": M U S H Y -> S is at position 3? That's good? 
Letters: M (at 1), U (2), S (3), H (4), Y (5). 
None of U, H, Y are excluded? 
So: U is available? Not excluded.
H available.
Y available.

So ""MUSHY"" is a valid word? Meaning damp, moist? Yes.

So we can use ""MUSHY"".

Another candidate: ""MASHY"", but A excluded -> invalid.

""MOUSY"", O excluded -> invalid.

""MYTHS"", T excluded -> invalid.

""MUSHY"" seems good.

But note: we also have the letter S at position 3? Previously, in MOIST we had S at position 4 and it was wrong. Now at position 3: if the secret word has S in position 3, we get ""✓"", else ""-"".

So we shall guess ""MUSHY"".

But wait: is there a word like ""MUCKS"" no because C excluded.

""LUMPS"" doesn't start with M.

So ""MUSHY"" appears to be a strong candidate.

Therefore, next guess: MUSHY.

But let me confirm: excluded letters are A, C, E, I, N, O, R, T. So M, U, S, H, Y: all valid.

Also, we include S at position 3 (new position) rather than 4, avoiding the known incorrect position.

So we'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- **CRANE** (Guess 1): All letters absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).
- **MOIST** (Guess 2): 
  - M is correct and in position 1 (✓).
  - O, I, T are absent (x) → not in the word.
  - S is present but in the wrong position (-) → S is in the word, but not at position 4.

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **M**.
- **S** is in the word but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5).
- Excluded letters (not in the word): **C, R, A, N, E, O, I, T**.
- Available letters for new guesses: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S, which is already confirmed present).

### Goal for Guess 3:
- Guess a valid word starting with **M** and containing **S** (in positions 2, 3, or 5—avoiding position 4).
- Use letters from the available set to test new possibilities.
- Optimal word: **MUSHY** (M at start, S at position 3, uses common available letters U, H, Y).

**MUSHY** tests:
- Positions: Unknown positions 2 (U), 3 (S), 4 (H), 5 (Y).
- If feedback shows U/H/Y/S in correct or incorrect positions, we gain new clues to narrow down the secret word.

<guess>MUSHY</guess>",MUSHY,"We have feedback from two guesses:
- Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
- Guess 2 (MOIST): Feedback is M(✓) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x). Breaking this down:
  - M is correct and in the correct position (position 1). So the secret word starts with M.
  - O is absent (x). So O is not in the word at all? But note: We had O in position 2, and it's absent. Since the feedback says ""x"" for O, it means O is not present anywhere in the secret word.
  - I is absent (x). So I is not in the word.
  - S is present but in the wrong position (-). So S is in the word, but not in position 4 (since we placed it at position 4 in MOIST).
  - T is absent (x). So T is not in the word.

Therefore, so far:
- The word starts with M.
- It contains the letter S, but not in position 4 (where we guessed it).
- It does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, T.

Also, from the first guess, we know the word has no C, R, A, N, E. So overall, excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, T.

Now, for the next guess:
- We know the first letter is M (correct and in position).
- We know S is in the word, but not in position 4.
- For positions 2, 3, 4, and 5, we must use letters that are not in the excluded set and try to include S in a position other than 4.

Available letters: Most of the alphabet minus excluded. Excluded: A, C, E, I, N, O, R, T. 

So available letters (among common ones): B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Also S is included, but we already know S is present.

Since S must be placed somewhere, we should try a word that has S not in position 4 and with M at the start.

We have positions:
1: M (fixed)
2: ? (must be from available letters, excluding O and I and T and the other excluded ones)
3: ?
4: ? (but cannot be S because we know from feedback that in position 4 it wasn't S; also in our guess, position 4 was S and it was wrong position, so S is not at position 4)
5: ?

We must include S somewhere in one of the positions 2,3,5 (since it can be in position 2,3, or 5 as long as not position 4). But note: when we say not position 4, that doesn't prevent positions 2,3,5.

For position 4, note that in our next guesses, we shouldn't put S there again because we know it's not there? Yes, because the feedback told us S is in the word but not at position 4.

We need to choose a valid 5-letter word that starts with M and has S in one of the positions 2,3, or 5 (but not 4). Also, we must not use any excluded letters.

Possible common letters to try: We haven't tested L, D, U, G, H, K, P, etc.

The word should include S. So let's think of words starting with M and containing S.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""MUSIC"": But I is excluded (from MOIST feedback, I is absent). So not allowed.
- ""MASKS"": But A and K? A is excluded (from CRANE), so A is not allowed; K is available? But ""MASKS"" has A and S at position 2 and 5? Let's not consider because A is excluded.

We must avoid A.

Another word: ""MUSHY"": But H and Y? Let's check:
  M U S H Y -> U and H and Y are available? But we don't know if they are present. Also, S is at position 3.

That might be a candidate. But let's see if we can think of more.

Another possibility: ""MOSSY"": But O is excluded? Yes, O is excluded from feedback. So O not allowed.

Another: ""MISSY"": But I is excluded. So no.

We must avoid I as well.

How about ""MANGO""? But A is excluded and O is excluded.

We need words using letters from the available set: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and S (but S is already known present).

Also, we don't know what other letters are in the word. We might try to include new letters to test.

Also, we don't know if U, K, Y are present? So ""MUSKY"" would test U at position 2, S at position 3, K at position 4, Y at position 5.

But note: position 4 we are putting K? That's okay because we don't have information about position 4.

Another candidate: ""MUSSY"": But that has two S's? And we are not sure if the word has two S's? But it might. However, ""MUSSY"" has U and Y. Also, S at positions 3 and 4? Position 4 is S again?

So ""MUSSY"" would be putting S in position 4 again, which we should avoid? The rules don't require we avoid, but it would be wasteful. Also, if we put S in position 4 again, the feedback would say ""-"" if S is in the word elsewhere? Actually, we know it's not in position 4, so we avoid.

Better not to put S at position 4 again.

So ""MUSKY"" places S at position 3 and avoids position 4.

Another candidate: ""MASHY"" but A is excluded -> invalid.

Another: ""MULSH"" - not a word.

Another: ""MUSTY"": Meaning stale. 
  M U S T Y -> But T is excluded? From MOIST feedback, T was absent. So T is excluded? Yes, from Guess 2: T was marked absent? In MOIST feedback: T(x) -> so T is not in the word. Therefore ""MUSTY"" has T -> invalid.

Another: ""MUSED"": But E is excluded? From CRANE feedback, E is absent -> invalid.

We can't use E.

What about ""MUCKS""? K and S? But S is at position 5? That would work. 
- M U C K S -> But C is excluded? From CRANE feedback, C is absent -> invalid.

C is excluded.

So ""MUCKS"" invalid because of C.

""BUMFS""?? Not a word.

Consider ""MUGGS"": Two Gs? But G is available? 
But we don't have S? ""MUGGS"" has no S? But we have to include S? Not necessarily? Wait, no: the feedback says S is in the word? So we must include S? Therefore, we cannot make a guess without S?

  M Y T H S -> But T is excluded? From MOIST feedback T(x) -> T is absent. So T is excluded -> invalid.

""SHULS"": But doesn't start with M.

Another: ""MULCH"": But C and H? C is excluded -> invalid.

Consider: ""MUHLY"" - a grass? But does it have S? No.

Not including S. We need to include S.

What about ""MUSSY""? I mentioned it earlier, but it has two S's? And we put S at position 4? But we know S is not at position 4? So should avoid.

Word: ""MUMSY"": Meaning drab? But U and M and S and Y? Letters: M,U,M,S,Y -> M at position 1 and 2? Position 2 would be U? But then S is at position 4 -> we know S is not at position 4? So ""MUMSY"" has S at position 4.

Guess: M U M S Y -> position 4 is S, which we know is wrong. So we expect the feedback to say S is present but not position 4? Which we already know. That doesn't give new information? But at least we test U, M (again?) and Y.

But M is already at position 1, so position 2 M is a guess? It might be redundant? Also, the secret word has M at position 1? So any extra M might be overcounted.

Moreover, the secret word might have double letters? We don't know? So possible? But ""MUSSY"" or ""MUMSY"" might be valid?

But ""MUMSY"" does not have the letters? It has M at position 1: we know ✓, then position 2: U, position 3: M (so testing M? but M already at 1? Then S at 4: which we know is not, and Y at 5.

But we are not supposed to put S at position 4? Actually, we can put it? The feedback would help if S is at 4? But we already know it's not? So the feedback will say ""-"" for S regardless of whether we put it at position 4? Because we know S is somewhere else? How does the feedback give information? If we put S at position 4 in a guess, then we know:
- If the feedback says ""-"" for that S, it means S is in the word but not at position 4? And we already know that? It doesn't tell us anything new? So waste of a guess? If the feedback says ""x"" for that S, that would be contradictory? Because we know S is present? So it can't say ""x"". So it must say ""-"", so no new information? Hence, avoid putting S in a position we already know it's not.

Thus, for position 4, we know it's not S, so we shouldn't put S there again.

Similarly, avoid putting S in any other position that we have already tried and gotten wrong? But we've only tried position 4? So positions 2,3,5 are untested.

Therefore, put S in position 2, 3, or 5.

Now back to finding words.

Let me try ""MUSHY"": M U S H Y -> S is at position 3? That's good? 
Letters: M (at 1), U (2), S (3), H (4), Y (5). 
None of U, H, Y are excluded? 
So: U is available? Not excluded.
H available.
Y available.

So ""MUSHY"" is a valid word? Meaning damp, moist? Yes.

So we can use ""MUSHY"".

Another candidate: ""MASHY"", but A excluded -> invalid.

""MOUSY"", O excluded -> invalid.

""MYTHS"", T excluded -> invalid.

""MUSHY"" seems good.

But note: we also have the letter S at position 3? Previously, in MOIST we had S at position 4 and it was wrong. Now at position 3: if the secret word has S in position 3, we get ""✓"", else ""-"".

So we shall guess ""MUSHY"".

But wait: is there a word like ""MUCKS"" no because C excluded.

""LUMPS"" doesn't start with M.

So ""MUSHY"" appears to be a strong candidate.

Therefore, next guess: MUSHY.

But let me confirm: excluded letters are A, C, E, I, N, O, R, T. So M, U, S, H, Y: all valid.

Also, we include S at position 3 (new position) rather than 4, avoiding the known incorrect position.

So we'll go with that.Based on the feedback:
- **CRANE** (Guess 1): All letters absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).
- **MOIST** (Guess 2): 
  - M is correct and in position 1 (✓).
  - O, I, T are absent (x) → not in the word.
  - S is present but in the wrong position (-) → S is in the word, but not at position 4.

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **M**.
- **S** is in the word but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5).
- Excluded letters (not in the word): **C, R, A, N, E, O, I, T**.
- Available letters for new guesses: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S, which is already confirmed present).

### Goal for Guess 3:
- Guess a valid word starting with **M** and containing **S** (in positions 2, 3, or 5—avoiding position 4).
- Use letters from the available set to test new possibilities.
- Optimal word: **MUSHY** (M at start, S at position 3, uses common available letters U, H, Y).

**MUSHY** tests:
- Positions: Unknown positions 2 (U), 3 (S), 4 (H), 5 (Y).
- If feedback shows U/H/Y/S in correct or incorrect positions, we gain new clues to narrow down the secret word.",Guess 3: MUSHY -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) U(✓) S(✓) H(x) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,musky,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no information yet, we should choose a word that has common letters and a good distribution to maximize information.
 Common vowels and consonants: A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N.
 A good starting word might be ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"", but let me pick one that is widely used.

 However, note that the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

 I recall that ""ROATE"" (which is an anagram of ORATE) is a popular starting word because it contains common letters and has been studied to have good properties. But let's use a more traditional one.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E — which are common.

 But note: the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", which are also common.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good candidate because it has S, L, A, T, E.

 Considering the feedback format, it would be beneficial to have as many common letters as possible and avoid repetitions.

 After some thought, I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 Remember: The goal of the first guess is to gather information about which letters are present and their positions.

 Let me check if ""CRANE"" is valid: yes, it is a word (meaning a large long-necked bird).

 So, I'll guess: CRANE

 Format: <guess>CRANE</guess>I am making my first guess without any prior information. For a strong starting word in Wordle, I need a word with common letters to maximize information from the feedback. Letters like vowels (A, E) and common consonants (R, S, T) are statistically optimal. 

A powerful first guess is **""CRANE""** because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- It covers over 50% of letters found in English 5-letter words on average.
- It has no repeating letters, ensuring each guess position tests a unique character.

This will provide immediate feedback on:
- Which of these common letters are present/absent.
- Whether any are in the correct positions.
- Giving a solid foundation for narrowing down the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> all letters are marked as 'x' meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 For the next guess:
 - We must avoid using any of C, R, A, N, E.
 - We should choose a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting other letters in the secret word.

 Common English letters (excluding C, R, A, N, E) include: S, T, O, L, I, D, M, P, etc.

 Since the word must be 5 letters and valid, we can try a word with as many of the remaining common letters as possible.

 For example, let's consider:
   S, T, O, L, I

 A good candidate might be ""SLOTH"", but note that we haven't checked frequency. Another common starting word that avoids these letters is ""PILOT"", but let's check:

 Possibilities:
   ""STOMP"" - includes S, T, O, M, P -> common letters, but note O and T are very common.
   ""MOIST"" - includes M, O, I, S, T -> all common and avoids the excluded set.

 However, we must ensure we don't use C, R, A, N, E.

 Considering ""MOIST"":
   M: not excluded -> okay
   O: not excluded -> okay
   I: not excluded -> okay
   S: not excluded -> okay
   T: not excluded -> okay

 Therefore, ""MOIST"" is a valid choice.

 Another alternative: ""PLUMP"" has repeating P and U is less common, so not ideal. ""SHIELD"" is 6 letters. So 5-letter words: 
   ""TOILS"", ""STOMP"", ""PIOUS"", etc., but ""MOIST"" seems strong.

 Let me confirm that ""MOIST"" is a valid English word: yes, meaning slightly wet.

 With ""MOIST"", we can get feedback on S, T, O, M, I.

 Let's choose ""MOIST"".

 But note: the feedback in the example used two guesses without repeating any letters, and that is a good strategy to get more information.

 Since we eliminated 5 common letters, we can focus on other letters.

 Alternatively, we might include U? But U is less common than O, I, S, T.

 Therefore, I will go with ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess **CRANE**, where **all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗)**, we know the secret word contains none of these letters. For the next guess:
- We need a word using entirely different, common letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, A, N, E).
- Ideal candidates include high-frequency consonants like **S, T, L, M**, and vowels like **O, I, U** (since E and A are ruled out).
- **""MOIST""** fits perfectly: it uses common letters (M, O, I, S, T), avoids the excluded set, and maximizes the chance of partial matches.

This guess will test new letters (M, O, I, S, T), helping narrow down possibilities based on position and presence.

<guess>MOIST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
- Guess 1 (CRANE): All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
- Guess 2 (MOIST): Feedback is M(✓) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x). Breaking this down:
  - M is correct and in the correct position (position 1). So the secret word starts with M.
  - O is absent (x). So O is not in the word at all? But note: We had O in position 2, and it's absent. Since the feedback says ""x"" for O, it means O is not present anywhere in the secret word.
  - I is absent (x). So I is not in the word.
  - S is present but in the wrong position (-). So S is in the word, but not in position 4 (since we placed it at position 4 in MOIST).
  - T is absent (x). So T is not in the word.

Therefore, so far:
- The word starts with M.
- It contains the letter S, but not in position 4 (where we guessed it).
- It does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, T.

Also, from the first guess, we know the word has no C, R, A, N, E. So overall, excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, T.

Now, for the next guess:
- We know the first letter is M (correct and in position).
- We know S is in the word, but not in position 4.
- For positions 2, 3, 4, and 5, we must use letters that are not in the excluded set and try to include S in a position other than 4.

Available letters: Most of the alphabet minus excluded. Excluded: A, C, E, I, N, O, R, T. 

So available letters (among common ones): B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Also S is included, but we already know S is present.

Since S must be placed somewhere, we should try a word that has S not in position 4 and with M at the start.

We have positions:
1: M (fixed)
2: ? (must be from available letters, excluding O and I and T and the other excluded ones)
3: ?
4: ? (but cannot be S because we know from feedback that in position 4 it wasn't S; also in our guess, position 4 was S and it was wrong position, so S is not at position 4)
5: ?

We must include S somewhere in one of the positions 2,3,5 (since it can be in position 2,3, or 5 as long as not position 4). But note: when we say not position 4, that doesn't prevent positions 2,3,5.

For position 4, note that in our next guesses, we shouldn't put S there again because we know it's not there? Yes, because the feedback told us S is in the word but not at position 4.

We need to choose a valid 5-letter word that starts with M and has S in one of the positions 2,3, or 5 (but not 4). Also, we must not use any excluded letters.

Possible common letters to try: We haven't tested L, D, U, G, H, K, P, etc.

The word should include S. So let's think of words starting with M and containing S.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""MUSIC"": But I is excluded (from MOIST feedback, I is absent). So not allowed.
- ""MASKS"": But A and K? A is excluded (from CRANE), so A is not allowed; K is available? But ""MASKS"" has A and S at position 2 and 5? Let's not consider because A is excluded.

We must avoid A.

Another word: ""MUSHY"": But H and Y? Let's check:
  M U S H Y -> U and H and Y are available? But we don't know if they are present. Also, S is at position 3.

That might be a candidate. But let's see if we can think of more.

Another possibility: ""MOSSY"": But O is excluded? Yes, O is excluded from feedback. So O not allowed.

Another: ""MISSY"": But I is excluded. So no.

We must avoid I as well.

How about ""MANGO""? But A is excluded and O is excluded.

We need words using letters from the available set: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and S (but S is already known present).

Also, we don't know what other letters are in the word. We might try to include new letters to test.

Let's list words starting with M and containing S (but not at position 4), and using only available letters.

Candidate: ""MUSKY"": Meaning, having the odor of musk. 
  M U S K Y -> Letters: U, S, K, Y (and M at start). Available letters? 
  Check excluded: U, S, K, Y none are in the excluded list. Also, we can place S at position 3? And avoid position 4.

But note: S is at position 3? That's allowed because in MOIST we had S at position 4 and incorrect. Now, position 3 is not position 4, so if S is there, it would be marked as ""-"" if it's in the word but wrong position? Actually, if S is in position 3 and in the secret word at position 3, we'd get ""✓"", but if at a different position, then ""-"".

We don't know the position of S yet. We only know it's not position 4.

Also, we don't know if U, K, Y are present? So ""MUSKY"" would test U at position 2, S at position 3, K at position 4, Y at position 5.

But note: position 4 we are putting K? That's okay because we don't have information about position 4.

Another candidate: ""MUSSY"": But that has two S's? And we are not sure if the word has two S's? But it might. However, ""MUSSY"" has U and Y. Also, S at positions 3 and 4? Position 4 is S again? But we know S is not at position 4? So we shouldn't put S at position 4 again? Actually, we shouldn't put S at position 4 again because we know it's not there. So ""MUSSY"" would be putting S in position 4 again, which we should avoid? The rules don't require we avoid, but it would be wasteful. Also, if we put S in position 4 again, the feedback would say ""-"" if S is in the word elsewhere? Actually, we know it's not in position 4, so we avoid.

Better not to put S at position 4 again.

So ""MUSKY"" places S at position 3 and avoids position 4.

Another candidate: ""MASHY"" but A is excluded -> invalid.

Another: ""MULSH"" - not a word.

Another: ""MUSTY"": Meaning stale. 
  M U S T Y -> But T is excluded? From MOIST feedback, T was absent. So T is excluded? Yes, from Guess 2: T was marked absent? In MOIST feedback: T(x) -> so T is not in the word. Therefore ""MUSTY"" has T -> invalid.

Another: ""MUSED"": But E is excluded? From CRANE feedback, E is absent -> invalid.

We can't use E.

Another: ""MOUSY"": O is excluded -> invalid.

Let me think: Words starting with M, containing S, with no excluded letters and S not at position 4.

Try ""MYSID"": Not a common word.

Common words: What about ""MAPES""? Not a word.

Better: ""MUSKY"" is valid. 
- M at 1: we know is ok.
- U at 2?
- S at 3? 
- K at 4? 
- Y at 5.

Another candidate: ""MASHED"": But A and E and D? A and E are excluded -> invalid.

""WIMPS"": Doesn't start with M.

We need M at first.

Another: ""MILDS"": But I and L? I is excluded -> invalid.

How about ""MULES"": But E -> excluded.

We are having trouble finding words. 

Another idea: ""SHOWY""? Doesn't start with M.

Focus: M _ _ _ _ and must include S in one of the last three positions? But positions 2,3,5? Alternatively, position 5.

What about ""MUCKS""? K and S? But S is at position 5? That would work. 
- M U C K S -> But C is excluded? From CRANE feedback, C is absent -> invalid.

C is excluded.

So ""MUCKS"" invalid because of C.

""BUMFS""?? Not a word.

Consider ""MUGGS"": Two Gs? But G is available? 
But we don't have S? ""MUGGS"" has no S? But we have to include S? Not necessarily? Wait, no: the feedback says S is in the word? So we must include S? Therefore, we cannot make a guess without S? We already know S is in the secret word? Actually, from Guess 2 feedback: S was marked as ""-"", meaning S is in the word. So any valid guess must include S? Or doesn't have to? Actually, we must include S because it's present? But we don't have to? It might be helpful to test other letters, but since we know S is in the word, we should use it to discover its location?

But the rules: We can guess any valid 5-letter word, but if we guess without S, then we are missing an opportunity to get information about S? And also, a good guess would include the known letter S to find its position.

Moreover, the word we guess must be a valid word that could be the secret word? Not necessarily, but it must be a valid English word.

So we must include S? Otherwise, we might get false negatives? Actually, we are not required to include S, but if we don't, we might not get information about S's position.

Also, the word must start with M (we know that). So we need a word starting with M and including S (since S is present, it's better to include).

Therefore, continue to find a word that starts with M, contains S (but not at position 4), and uses available letters.

Try ""MYTHS"": Meaning plural of myth. 
  M Y T H S -> But T is excluded? From MOIST feedback T(x) -> T is absent. So T is excluded -> invalid.

""SHULS"": But doesn't start with M.

Another: ""MULCH"": But C and H? C is excluded -> invalid.

Consider: ""MUHLY"" - a grass? But does it have S? No.

Not including S. We need to include S.

What about ""MUSSY""? I mentioned it earlier, but it has two S's? And we put S at position 4? But we know S is not at position 4? So should avoid.

Word: ""MUMSY"": Meaning drab? But U and M and S and Y? Letters: M,U,M,S,Y -> M at position 1 and 2? Position 2 would be U? But then S is at position 4 -> we know S is not at position 4? So ""MUMSY"" has S at position 4.

Guess: M U M S Y -> position 4 is S, which we know is wrong. So we expect the feedback to say S is present but not position 4? Which we already know. That doesn't give new information? But at least we test U, M (again?) and Y.

But M is already at position 1, so position 2 M is a guess? It might be redundant? Also, the secret word has M at position 1? So any extra M might be overcounted.

Moreover, the secret word might have double letters? We don't know? So possible? But ""MUSSY"" or ""MUMSY"" might be valid?

But ""MUMSY"" does not have the letters? It has M at position 1: we know ✓, then position 2: U, position 3: M (so testing M? but M already at 1? Then S at 4: which we know is not, and Y at 5.

But we are not supposed to put S at position 4? Actually, we can put it? The feedback would help if S is at 4? But we already know it's not? So the feedback will say ""-"" for S regardless of whether we put it at position 4? Because we know S is somewhere else? How does the feedback give information? If we put S at position 4 in a guess, then we know:
- If the feedback says ""-"" for that S, it means S is in the word but not at position 4? And we already know that? It doesn't tell us anything new? So waste of a guess? If the feedback says ""x"" for that S, that would be contradictory? Because we know S is present? So it can't say ""x"". So it must say ""-"", so no new information? Hence, avoid putting S in a position we already know it's not.

Thus, for position 4, we know it's not S, so we shouldn't put S there again.

Similarly, avoid putting S in any other position that we have already tried and gotten wrong? But we've only tried position 4? So positions 2,3,5 are untested.

Therefore, put S in position 2, 3, or 5.

Now back to finding words.

Let me try ""MUSHY"": M U S H Y -> S is at position 3? That's good? 
Letters: M (at 1), U (2), S (3), H (4), Y (5). 
None of U, H, Y are excluded? 
So: U is available? Not excluded.
H available.
Y available.

So ""MUSHY"" is a valid word? Meaning damp, moist? Yes.

So we can use ""MUSHY"".

Another candidate: ""MASHY"", but A excluded -> invalid.

""MOUSY"", O excluded -> invalid.

""MYTHS"", T excluded -> invalid.

""MUSHY"" seems good.

But note: we also have the letter S at position 3? Previously, in MOIST we had S at position 4 and it was wrong. Now at position 3: if the secret word has S in position 3, we get ""✓"", else ""-"".

So we shall guess ""MUSHY"".

But wait: is there a word like ""MUCKS"" no because C excluded.

""LUMPS"" doesn't start with M.

So ""MUSHY"" appears to be a strong candidate.

Therefore, next guess: MUSHY.

But let me confirm: excluded letters are A, C, E, I, N, O, R, T. So M, U, S, H, Y: all valid.

Also, we include S at position 3 (new position) rather than 4, avoiding the known incorrect position.

So we'll go with that.Based on the feedback:
- **CRANE** (Guess 1): All letters absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).
- **MOIST** (Guess 2): 
  - M is correct and in position 1 (✓).
  - O, I, T are absent (x) → not in the word.
  - S is present but in the wrong position (-) → S is in the word, but not at position 4.

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **M**.
- **S** is in the word but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5).
- Excluded letters (not in the word): **C, R, A, N, E, O, I, T**.
- Available letters for new guesses: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S, which is already confirmed present).

### Goal for Guess 3:
- Guess a valid word starting with **M** and containing **S** (in positions 2, 3, or 5—avoiding position 4).
- Use letters from the available set to test new possibilities.
- Optimal word: **MUSHY** (M at start, S at position 3, uses common available letters U, H, Y).

**MUSHY** tests:
- Positions: Unknown positions 2 (U), 3 (S), 4 (H), 5 (Y).
- If feedback shows U/H/Y/S in correct or incorrect positions, we gain new clues to narrow down the secret word.

Another common starting word that avoids these letters is ""PILOT"", but let\'s check:\n\n Possibilities:\n   ""STOMP"" - includes S, T, O, M, P -> common letters, but note O and T are very common.\n   ""MOIST"" - includes M, O, I, S, T -> all common and avoids the excluded set.\n\n However, we must ensure we don\'t use C, R, A, N, E.\n\n Considering ""MOIST"":\n   M: not excluded -> okay\n   O: not excluded -> okay\n   I: not excluded -> okay\n   S: not excluded -> okay\n   T: not excluded -> okay\n\n Therefore, ""MOIST"" is a valid choice.\n\n Another alternative: ""PLUMP"" has repeating P and U is less common, so not ideal.

So the secret word starts with M.\n  - O is absent (x). So O is not in the word at all? But note: We had O in position 2, and it\'s absent. Since the feedback says ""x"" for O, it means O is not present anywhere in the secret word.\n  - I is absent (x). So I is not in the word.\n  - S is present but in the wrong position (-). So S is in the word, but not in position 4 (since we placed it at position 4 in MOIST).\n  - T is absent (x). So T is not in the word.\n\nTherefore, so far:\n- The word starts with M.\n- It contains the letter S, but not in position 4 (where we guessed it).\n- It does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, T.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know the word has no C, R, A, N, E. So overall, excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, T.\n\nNow, for the next guess:\n- We know the first letter is M (correct and in position).\n- We know S is in the word, but not in position 4.\n- For positions 2, 3, 4, and 5, we must use letters that are not in the excluded set and try to include S in a position other than 4.\n\nAvailable letters: Most of the alphabet minus excluded. Excluded: A, C, E, I, N, O, R, T. \n\nSo available letters (among common ones): B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Also S is included, but we already know S is present.\n\nSince S must be placed somewhere, we should try a word that has S not in position 4 and with M at the start.\n\nWe have positions:\n1: M (fixed)\n2: ? (must be from available letters, excluding O and I and T and the other excluded ones)\n3: ?\n4: ? (but cannot be S because we know from feedback that in position 4 it wasn\'t S; also in our guess, position 4 was S and it was wrong position, so S is not at position 4)\n5: ?\n\nWe must include S somewhere in one of the positions 2,3,5 (since it can be in position 2,3, or 5 as long as not position 4). But note: when we say not position 4, that doesn\'t prevent positions 2,3,5.\n\nFor position 4, note that in our next guesses, we shouldn\'t put S there again because we know it\'s not there? Yes, because the feedback told us S is in the word but not at position 4.\n\nWe need to choose a valid 5-letter word that starts with M and has S in one of the positions 2,3, or 5 (but not 4). Also, we must not use any excluded letters.\n\nPossible common letters to try: We haven\'t tested L, D, U, G, H, K, P, etc.\n\nThe word should include S. So let\'s think of words starting with M and containing S.\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n- ""MUSIC"": But I is excluded (from MOIST feedback, I is absent). So not allowed.\n- ""MASKS"": But A and K? A is excluded (from CRANE), so A is not allowed; K is available? But ""MASKS"" has A and S at position 2 and 5? Let\'s not consider because A is excluded.\n\nWe must avoid A.\n\nAnother word: ""MUSHY"": But H and Y? Let\'s check:\n  M U S H Y -> U and H and Y are available? But we don\'t know if they are present. Also, S is at position 3.\n\nThat might be a candidate. But let\'s see if we can think of more.\n\nAnother possibility: ""MOSSY"": But O is excluded? Yes, O is excluded from feedback. So O not allowed.\n\nAnother: ""MISSY"": But I is excluded. So no.\n\nWe must avoid I as well.\n\nHow about ""MANGO""? But A is excluded and O is excluded.\n\nWe need words using letters from the available set: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and S (but S is already known present).\n\nAlso, we don\'t know what other letters are in the word. We might try to include new letters to test.\n\nLet\'s list words starting with M and containing S (but not at position 4), and using only available letters.\n\nCandidate: ""MUSKY"": Meaning, having the odor of musk. \n  M U S K Y -> Letters: U, S, K, Y (and M at start). Available letters? \n  Check excluded: U, S, K, Y none are in the excluded list. Also, we can place S at position 3? And avoid position 4.\n\nBut note: S is at position 3? That\'s allowed because in MOIST we had S at position 4 and incorrect. Now, position 3 is not position 4, so if S is there, it would be marked as ""-"" if it\'s in the word but wrong position? Actually, if S is in position 3 and in the secret word at position 3, we\'d get ""✓"", but if at a different position, then ""-"".\n\nWe don\'t know the position of S yet. We only know it\'s not position 4.\n\nAlso, we don\'t know if U, K, Y are present? So ""MUSKY"" would test U at position 2, S at position 3, K at position 4, Y at position 5.\n\nBut note: position 4 we are putting K? That\'s okay because we don\'t have information about position 4.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MUSSY"": But that has two S\'s? And we are not sure if the word has two S\'s? But it might. However, ""MUSSY"" has U and Y. Also, S at positions 3 and 4? Position 4 is S again? But we know S is not at position 4? So we shouldn\'t put S at position 4 again? Actually, we shouldn\'t put S at position 4 again because we know it\'s not there. So ""MUSSY"" would be putting S in position 4 again, which we should avoid? The rules don\'t require we avoid, but it would be wasteful. Also, if we put S in position 4 again, the feedback would say ""-"" if S is in the word elsewhere? Actually, we know it\'s not in position 4, so we avoid.\n\nBetter not to put S at position 4 again.\n\nSo ""MUSKY"" places S at position 3 and avoids position 4.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MASHY"" but A is excluded -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""MULSH"" - not a word.\n\nAnother: ""MUSTY"": Meaning stale. \n  M U S T Y -> But T is excluded? From MOIST feedback, T was absent. So T is excluded? Yes, from Guess 2: T was marked absent? In MOIST feedback: T(x) -> so T is not in the word. Therefore ""MUSTY"" has T -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""MUSED"": But E is excluded? From CRANE feedback, E is absent -> invalid.\n\nWe can\'t use E.\n\nAnother: ""MOUSY"": O is excluded -> invalid.\n\nLet me think: Words starting with M, containing S, with no excluded letters and S not at position 4.\n\nTry ""MYSID"": Not a common word.\n\nCommon words: What about ""MAPES""? Not a word.\n\nBetter: ""MUSKY"" is valid. \n- M at 1: we know is ok.\n- U at 2?\n- S at 3? \n- K at 4? \n- Y at 5.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MASHED"": But A and E and D? A and E are excluded -> invalid.\n\n""WIMPS"": Doesn\'t start with M.\n\nWe need M at first.\n\nAnother: ""MILDS"": But I and L? I is excluded -> invalid.\n\nHow about ""MULES"": But E -> excluded.\n\nWe are having trouble finding words. \n\nAnother idea: ""SHOWY""? Doesn\'t start with M.\n\nFocus: M _ _ _ _ and must include S in one of the last three positions? But positions 2,3,5? Alternatively, position 5.\n\nWhat about ""MUCKS""? K and S? But S is at position 5? That would work. \n- M U C K S -> But C is excluded? From CRANE feedback, C is absent -> invalid.\n\nC is excluded.\n\nSo ""MUCKS"" invalid because of C.\n\n""BUMFS""?? Not a word.\n\nConsider ""MUGGS"": Two Gs? But G is available? \nBut we don\'t have S? ""MUGGS"" has no S? But we have to include S? Not necessarily? Wait, no: the feedback says S is in the word? So we must include S? Therefore, we cannot make a guess without S? We already know S is in the secret word? Actually, from Guess 2 feedback: S was marked as ""-"", meaning S is in the word. So any valid guess must include S? Or doesn\'t have to? Actually, we must include S because it\'s present? But we don\'t have to? It might be helpful to test other letters, but since we know S is in the word, we should use it to discover its location?\n\nBut the rules: We can guess any valid 5-letter word, but if we guess without S, then we are missing an opportunity to get information about S? And also, a good guess would include the known letter S to find its position.\n\nMoreover, the word we guess must be a valid word that could be the secret word? Not necessarily, but it must be a valid English word.\n\nSo we must include S? Otherwise, we might get false negatives? Actually, we are not required to include S, but if we don\'t, we might not get information about S\'s position.\n\nAlso, the word must start with M (we know that). So we need a word starting with M and including S (since S is present, it\'s better to include).\n\nTherefore, continue to find a word that starts with M, contains S (but not at position 4), and uses available letters.\n\nTry ""MYTHS"": Meaning plural of myth. \n  M Y T H S -> But T is excluded? From MOIST feedback T(x) -> T is absent. So T is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""SHULS"": But doesn\'t start with M.\n\nAnother: ""MULCH"": But C and H? C is excluded -> invalid.\n\nConsider: ""MUHLY"" - a grass? But does it have S? No.\n\nNot including S. We need to include S.\n\nWhat about ""MUSSY""? I mentioned it earlier, but it has two S\'s? And we put S at position 4? But we know S is not at position 4? So should avoid.\n\nWord: ""MUMSY"": Meaning drab? But U and M and S and Y? Letters: M,U,M,S,Y -> M at position 1 and 2? Position 2 would be U? But then S is at position 4 -> we know S is not at position 4? So ""MUMSY"" has S at position 4.\n\nGuess: M U M S Y -> position 4 is S, which we know is wrong. So we expect the feedback to say S is present but not position 4? Which we already know. That doesn\'t give new information? But at least we test U, M (again?) and Y.\n\nBut M is already at position 1, so position 2 M is a guess? It might be redundant? Also, the secret word has M at position 1? So any extra M might be overcounted.\n\nMoreover, the secret word might have double letters? We don\'t know? So possible? But ""MUSSY"" or ""MUMSY"" might be valid?\n\nBut ""MUMSY"" does not have the letters? It has M at position 1: we know ✓, then position 2: U, position 3: M (so testing M? but M already at 1? Then S at 4: which we know is not, and Y at 5.\n\nBut we are not supposed to put S at position 4? Actually, we can put it? The feedback would help if S is at 4? But we already know it\'s not? So the feedback will say ""-"" for S regardless of whether we put it at position 4? Because we know S is somewhere else? How does the feedback give information? If we put S at position 4 in a guess, then we know:\n- If the feedback says ""-"" for that S, it means S is in the word but not at position 4? And we already know that? It doesn\'t tell us anything new? So waste of a guess? If the feedback says ""x"" for that S, that would be contradictory? Because we know S is present? So it can\'t say ""x"". So it must say ""-"", so no new information? Hence, avoid putting S in a position we already know it\'s not.\n\nThus, for position 4, we know it\'s not S, so we shouldn\'t put S there again.\n\nSimilarly, avoid putting S in any other position that we have already tried and gotten wrong? But we\'ve only tried position 4? So positions 2,3,5 are untested.\n\nTherefore, put S in position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nNow back to finding words.\n\nLet me try ""MUSHY"": M U S H Y -> S is at position 3? That\'s good? \nLetters: M (at 1), U (2), S (3), H (4), Y (5). \nNone of U, H, Y are excluded? \nSo: U is available? Not excluded.\nH available.\nY available.\n\nSo ""MUSHY"" is a valid word? Meaning damp, moist? Yes.\n\nSo we can use ""MUSHY"".\n\nAnother candidate: ""MASHY"", but A excluded -> invalid.\n\n""MOUSY"", O excluded -> invalid.\n\n""MYTHS"", T excluded -> invalid.\n\n""MUSHY"" seems good.\n\nBut note: we also have the letter S at position 3? Previously, in MOIST we had S at position 4 and it was wrong. Now at position 3: if the secret word has S in position 3, we get ""✓"", else ""-"".\n\nSo we shall guess ""MUSHY"".\n\nBut wait: is there a word like ""MUCKS"" no because C excluded.\n\n""LUMPS"" doesn\'t start with M.\n\nSo ""MUSHY"" appears to be a strong candidate.\n\nTherefore, next guess: MUSHY.\n\nBut let me confirm: excluded letters are A, C, E, I, N, O, R, T. So M, U, S, H, Y: all valid.\n\nAlso, we include S at position 3 (new position) rather than 4, avoiding the known incorrect position.\n\nSo we\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback:\n- **CRANE** (Guess 1): All letters absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).\n- **MOIST** (Guess 2): \n  - M is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n  - O, I, T are absent (x) → not in the word.\n  - S is present but in the wrong position (-) → S is in the word, but not at position 4.\n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word starts with **M**.\n- **S** is in the word but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5).\n- Excluded letters (not in the word): **C, R, A, N, E, O, I, T**.\n- Available letters for new guesses: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S, which is already confirmed present).\n\n### Goal for Guess 3:\n- Guess a valid word starting with **M** and containing **S** (in positions 2, 3, or 5—avoiding position 4).\n- Use letters from the available set to test new possibilities.\n- Optimal word: **MUSHY** (M at start, S at position 3, uses common available letters U, H, Y).\n\n**MUSHY** tests:\n- Positions: Unknown positions 2 (U), 3 (S), 4 (H), 5 (Y).\n- If feedback shows U/H/Y/S in correct or incorrect positions, we gain new clues to narrow down the secret word.\n\n<guess>MUSHY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: MUSHY -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) U(✓) S(✓) H(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

1. **CRANE**: All letters are absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word).
2. **MOIST**: 
   - M is correct and in the right position (position 1).
   - O, I, T are absent (not in the word).
   - S is present but in the wrong position (specifically, not in position 4).
3. **MUSHY**:
   - M is correct (position 1) → ✓ (as before)
   - U is correct and in position! Position 2 must be U → ✓
   - S is correct and in position! Position 3 must be S → ✓
   - H is absent → x (so H is not in the word)
   - Y is correct and in position! Position 5 must be Y → ✓

Therefore, we know:
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: S
- Position 5: Y
- Position 4: ? (we don't know yet)

And we know the letter at position 4:
- Cannot be any of: C, R, A, N, E (from CRANE), O, I, T (from MOIST), H (from MUSHY), and obviously M, U, S, Y cannot appear elsewhere.
- Since we have four positions known and one unknown, we can deduce the word pattern: M U S ? Y

The missing letter at position 4 must be a letter not excluded and not one of the known ones.
Letters excluded so far: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, T, H.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and any other not mentioned).

But note: The secret word must be an English word. We need a word of the form: MUS_Y

What letters can fill position 4? Possible from available set?

Common words with MUS_Y:
- Must be a valid English word ending with Y after MUS?. The pattern is MUS?Y.

Possible? Let's list common words:
- ""MUSSY""? But S would repeat? And we have MUS_Y, so the fourth letter is the one we're guessing. MUSSY has two S's? Pattern MUSSY: positions M(1), U(2), S(3), S(4), Y(5). But in our case, we have S at position 3? And the missing is position 4.

But ""MUSSY"" would have S at both position 3 and 4? However, from MOIST feedback: we had S at position 4? And it was absent? Now if we consider MUSSY, it would have S at position 4? But MOIST feedback said S was present but not at position 4? So that matches? However, in MUSHY we got S at position 3 as correct? So if the secret word is MUSSY, then in MOIST we guessed S at position 4? Which was wrong? And in MUSHY we guessed S at position 3? Which was correct? But MUSSY also has an S at position 4? So why didn't the feedback from MOIST show that S is present? Because even though we placed S at position 4, the letter S is in the word? But at position 4? In MOIST: we guessed S at position 4? For MUSSY? Then the feedback: for position 4? It was S? And if the correct word is MUSSY? Then position 4 is S? So it should have been ""✓"" for that S? But in MOIST feedback it was ""-"", meaning it is present but in the wrong position? Because if it were correct? It would be ✓? But it was not? So contradiction? 

Actually, for MOIST: 
- Secret word MUSSY: 
- Comparing MOIST to MUSSY:
  - Position 1: M vs M → ✓
  - Position 2: O vs U → different, O not in word? So x (but O not in word)
  - Position 3: I vs S → different, I not in word? So x
  - Position 4: S vs S → same? So should be ✓? But the feedback was S(-)? Meaning it was not in the correct position? So that doesn't match.

Therefore, if the secret word were MUSSY, position 4 is S? Then in MOIST guess? Position 4 is S? That would be exact match? So feedback should be ✓? But it was given as -? So that means position 4 is not S? Therefore, MUSSY cannot be the word? Because it would conflict with the feedback? 

So MUSSY is invalid? 

Then what other words? MUSKY? But K? MUSKY: M U S K Y? Position 1:M, 2:U, 3:S, 4:K, 5:Y? 

Now compare with our feedback from MUSHY:
- We guessed MUSHY: M U S H Y? 
- For position 1: M ✓ -> same as secret if MUSKY.
- Position 2: U ✓ -> same?
- Position 3: S ✓ -> same?
- Position 4: H vs K? H is not in MUSKY? So feedback for H? Since H is absent? Then x? As we got? 
- Position 5: Y ✓ -> same? 

Also for MOIST:
- Position 4: in MOIST we put S? Secret MUSKY? Position 4 is K? So S in MOIST at position 4? Is S elsewhere? At position 3? Then S is in the word? But not at position 4? So feedback ""S-"" is correct? 

Therefore, MUSKY fits? 

Now, other possibilities? What about ""MUSTY""? But T is excluded? Invalid.

""MUSBY""? Not a word.

""MUDSY""? Not a common word? But ""muddy""? Not matching pattern? 

""MUSSY"" we already saw conflicts? 

Another: ""MULSY""? Probably not a word.

Therefore, ""MUSKY"" seems a candidate.

But are there others? ""BUSKY""? But doesn't start with M.

So MUSKY? 

But note: in our excluded list? We haven't used K? And it's available? 

Therefore, the secret word must be MUSKY? That explains all feedback? 

In MUSHY, we got H absent? And Y present? Which matches MUSKY? 

Therefore, we can guess MUSKY? 

But note: we must be cautious? Because we have only one position left? And we can solve it? 

Since the pattern is M U S _ Y? And we know the fourth letter must not be any of the excluded? And from above, K is available? 

But is there another word? For example, ""MUSPY""? Not a word? ""MUSEY""? But E is excluded? Invalid? 

"" MUSGY""? Not a word? ""MUSLY""? Not a word? 

Therefore, ""MUSKY"" is the only common word? 

So we can guess MUSKY? 

We have 3 tries left? So we can guess? 

Also, note: if we guess MUSKY, and it's correct? Then we win? 

Therefore, I will go with MUSKY.
</think>
Based on the feedback from all guesses:
- **CRANE (Guess 1)**: Letters C, R, A, N, E → **all absent (✗)**, so none are in the secret word.
- **MOIST (Guess 2)**:
  - M → **correct and in position 1 (✓)** → secret word starts with M.
  - O, I, T → **absent (✗)** → not in the word.
  - S → **present but wrong position (-)** → S is in the word, but not position 4.
- **MUSHY (Guess 3)**:
  - M → **correct and in position 1 (✓)** → consistent.
  - U → **correct and in position 2 (✓)** → secret word position 2 is U.
  - S → **correct and in position 3 (✓)** → secret word position 3 is S.
  - H → **absent (✗)** → not in the word.
  - Y → **correct and in position 5 (✓)** → secret word position 5 is Y.

### Deductions:
1. The secret word pattern is **M U S _ Y** (positions 1-3 and 5 confirmed).
2. Position 4 must be a letter **not excluded** and **not present** elsewhere (since positions 1-5 are unique/confirmed).
3. Excluded letters (absent per feedback):  
   - From CRANE: C, R, A, N, E  
   - From MOIST: O, I, T  
   - From MUSHY: H  
   - Total excluded: A, C, E, H, I, N, O, R, T  
4. Available letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

### Solving position 4:
- Only common English words fitting the pattern **MUS_Y** are **MUSKY** (meaning having a musklike smell) and **MUSSY** (variant/informal, meaning messy).  
- **MUSSY** conflicts with prior feedback:  
  - If the word were MUSSY, position 4 would be S. But MOIST (Guess 2) placed S at position 4 and received ""–"", meaning S is **not** at position 4. MUSSY would require S at position 4 → contradiction.  
- **MUSKY** uses K (an available letter) at position 4 and aligns with all feedback:  
  - If secret word is MUSKY:  
    - MOIST: S at position 4 → secret has K at position 4 → ""S(–)"" for S being present but not at position 4 is satisfied.  
    - MUSHY: Position 4 H → absent because MUSKY has no H → ""H(✗)"" satisfied.  

Thus, **MUSKY** is the only valid solution.

### Next Guess:
Confidently guess **MUSKY** to confirm and win the game (if correct) or refute (if K is wrong, though unlikely). 

<guess>MUSKY</guess>",MUSKY,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. **CRANE**: All letters are absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word).
2. **MOIST**: 
   - M is correct and in the right position (position 1).
   - O, I, T are absent (not in the word).
   - S is present but in the wrong position (specifically, not in position 4).
3. **MUSHY**:
   - M is correct (position 1) → ✓ (as before)
   - U is correct and in position! Position 2 must be U → ✓
   - S is correct and in position! Position 3 must be S → ✓
   - H is absent → x (so H is not in the word)
   - Y is correct and in position! Position 5 must be Y → ✓

Therefore, we know:
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: S
- Position 5: Y
- Position 4: ? (we don't know yet)

And we know the letter at position 4:
- Cannot be any of: C, R, A, N, E (from CRANE), O, I, T (from MOIST), H (from MUSHY), and obviously M, U, S, Y cannot appear elsewhere.
- Since we have four positions known and one unknown, we can deduce the word pattern: M U S ? Y

The missing letter at position 4 must be a letter not excluded and not one of the known ones.
Letters excluded so far: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, T, H.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and any other not mentioned).

But note: The secret word must be an English word. We need a word of the form: MUS_Y

What letters can fill position 4? Possible from available set?

Common words with MUS_Y:
- Must be a valid English word ending with Y after MUS?. The pattern is MUS?Y.

Possible? Let's list common words:
- ""MUSSY""? But S would repeat? And we have MUS_Y, so the fourth letter is the one we're guessing. MUSSY has two S's? Pattern MUSSY: positions M(1), U(2), S(3), S(4), Y(5). But in our case, we have S at position 3? And the missing is position 4.

But ""MUSSY"" would have S at both position 3 and 4? However, from MOIST feedback: we had S at position 4? And it was absent? Now if we consider MUSSY, it would have S at position 4? But MOIST feedback said S was present but not at position 4? So that matches? However, in MUSHY we got S at position 3 as correct? So if the secret word is MUSSY, then in MOIST we guessed S at position 4? Which was wrong? And in MUSHY we guessed S at position 3? Which was correct? But MUSSY also has an S at position 4? So why didn't the feedback from MOIST show that S is present? Because even though we placed S at position 4, the letter S is in the word? But at position 4? In MOIST: we guessed S at position 4? For MUSSY? Then the feedback: for position 4? It was S? And if the correct word is MUSSY? Then position 4 is S? So it should have been ""✓"" for that S? But in MOIST feedback it was ""-"", meaning it is present but in the wrong position? Because if it were correct? It would be ✓? But it was not? So contradiction? 

Actually, for MOIST: 
- Secret word MUSSY: 
- Comparing MOIST to MUSSY:
  - Position 1: M vs M → ✓
  - Position 2: O vs U → different, O not in word? So x (but O not in word)
  - Position 3: I vs S → different, I not in word? So x
  - Position 4: S vs S → same? So should be ✓? But the feedback was S(-)? Meaning it was not in the correct position? So that doesn't match.

Therefore, if the secret word were MUSSY, position 4 is S? Then in MOIST guess? Position 4 is S? That would be exact match? So feedback should be ✓? But it was given as -? So that means position 4 is not S? Therefore, MUSSY cannot be the word? Because it would conflict with the feedback? 

So MUSSY is invalid? 

Then what other words? MUSKY? But K? MUSKY: M U S K Y? Position 1:M, 2:U, 3:S, 4:K, 5:Y? 

Now compare with our feedback from MUSHY:
- We guessed MUSHY: M U S H Y? 
- For position 1: M ✓ -> same as secret if MUSKY.
- Position 2: U ✓ -> same?
- Position 3: S ✓ -> same?
- Position 4: H vs K? H is not in MUSKY? So feedback for H? Since H is absent? Then x? As we got? 
- Position 5: Y ✓ -> same? 

Also for MOIST:
- Position 4: in MOIST we put S? Secret MUSKY? Position 4 is K? So S in MOIST at position 4? Is S elsewhere? At position 3? Then S is in the word? But not at position 4? So feedback ""S-"" is correct? 

Therefore, MUSKY fits? 

Now, other possibilities? What about ""MUSTY""? But T is excluded? Invalid.

""MUSBY""? Not a word.

""MUDSY""? Not a common word? But ""muddy""? Not matching pattern? 

""MUSSY"" we already saw conflicts? 

Another: ""MULSY""? Probably not a word.

Therefore, ""MUSKY"" seems a candidate.

But are there others? ""BUSKY""? But doesn't start with M.

So MUSKY? 

But note: in our excluded list? We haven't used K? And it's available? 

Therefore, the secret word must be MUSKY? That explains all feedback? 

In MUSHY, we got H absent? And Y present? Which matches MUSKY? 

Therefore, we can guess MUSKY? 

But note: we must be cautious? Because we have only one position left? And we can solve it? 

Since the pattern is M U S _ Y? And we know the fourth letter must not be any of the excluded? And from above, K is available? 

But is there another word? For example, ""MUSPY""? Not a word? ""MUSEY""? But E is excluded? Invalid? 

"" MUSGY""? Not a word? ""MUSLY""? Not a word? 

Therefore, ""MUSKY"" is the only common word? 

So we can guess MUSKY? 

We have 3 tries left? So we can guess? 

Also, note: if we guess MUSKY, and it's correct? Then we win? 

Therefore, I will go with MUSKY.Based on the feedback from all guesses:
- **CRANE (Guess 1)**: Letters C, R, A, N, E → **all absent (✗)**, so none are in the secret word.
- **MOIST (Guess 2)**:
  - M → **correct and in position 1 (✓)** → secret word starts with M.
  - O, I, T → **absent (✗)** → not in the word.
  - S → **present but wrong position (-)** → S is in the word, but not position 4.
- **MUSHY (Guess 3)**:
  - M → **correct and in position 1 (✓)** → consistent.
  - U → **correct and in position 2 (✓)** → secret word position 2 is U.
  - S → **correct and in position 3 (✓)** → secret word position 3 is S.
  - H → **absent (✗)** → not in the word.
  - Y → **correct and in position 5 (✓)** → secret word position 5 is Y.

### Deductions:
1. The secret word pattern is **M U S _ Y** (positions 1-3 and 5 confirmed).
2. Position 4 must be a letter **not excluded** and **not present** elsewhere (since positions 1-5 are unique/confirmed).
3. Excluded letters (absent per feedback):  
   - From CRANE: C, R, A, N, E  
   - From MOIST: O, I, T  
   - From MUSHY: H  
   - Total excluded: A, C, E, H, I, N, O, R, T  
4. Available letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

### Solving position 4:
- Only common English words fitting the pattern **MUS_Y** are **MUSKY** (meaning having a musklike smell) and **MUSSY** (variant/informal, meaning messy).  
- **MUSSY** conflicts with prior feedback:  
  - If the word were MUSSY, position 4 would be S. But MOIST (Guess 2) placed S at position 4 and received ""–"", meaning S is **not** at position 4. MUSSY would require S at position 4 → contradiction.

    - MOIST: S at position 4 → secret has K at position 4 → ""S(–)"" for S being present but not at position 4 is satisfied.  
    - MUSHY: Position 4 H → absent because MUSKY has no H → ""H(✗)"" satisfied.  

Thus, **MUSKY** is the only valid solution.

### Next Guess:
Confidently guess **MUSKY** to confirm and win the game (if correct) or refute (if K is wrong, though unlikely).",Guess 4: MUSKY -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) U(✓) S(✓) K(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
