We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the secret word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is the second letter and feedback says wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Therefore, the secret word includes R, and excludes C, A, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, A, N, E (the bad letters)
- Includes R, but not in the second position (since in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was wrong)
- We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Since R is in the word, we should place R in a different position. Possible positions for R: 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th.

We also need to consider other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (since A and E are out). We might also include common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

Let me think of a word that includes R in a position other than second and avoids the bad letters (C, A, N, E).

Possible words:
- Try words that have R in the first position? Or third? etc.

Common possibilities: 
- Words starting with R: but we don't know if R can be at the start. But feedback only said R is present and not in position 2, so it could be in any other position.

We should also try to cover more letters. Since we have eliminated four letters (C, A, N, E) and know R is included, we have 21 letters left to consider.

I think a good strategy is to choose a word that uses as many of the remaining common letters as possible.

Common consonants beyond R: T, S, L, D, M, etc.

Let's try to pick a word that has R and four other new letters.

For example:
- ""ROTIS"" – but that's not very common? Actually, ""ROTIS"" might not be a word. 
- How about ""ROAST"" – but A is bad, so no, because we know A is not in the word. Similarly, we must avoid A.

Wait, we must avoid A? Feedback said A: x – so A is not in the word.

So avoiding: C, A, N, E.

Possible words: 
- We might try ""SPRIG"" – but let's see: S, P, R, I, G. That uses R not in the second position? We can choose.

However, we don't know the positions, so we might place R in a different spot.

Another idea: since R must be somewhere else, let us try R in position 1? Then we can test if R is at the beginning.

But note: we don't want to reuse bad letters.

Let me list possibilities: The word cannot have A, C, N, E.

Consider: Words with R and common letters like S, T, L, I, O, etc.

I think ""TRYST"" might not be ideal because it has repeated T? Or ""ROOMS"" – again, has O and M and S? But we don't know about O or M.

Actually, I recall that in Wordle, some good second guesses after eliminating several vowels might be words like ""PIOUS"" or ""MURKY"", but we have specific constraints.

Another constraint: the word must be 5 letters and in English.

Let me try to come up with a word that contains R and avoids the bad letters. Also, we want to test new letters.

Possible word: ""ROWDY"" – this has R, O, W, D, Y. But R is in the first position? That's fine. Avoids C, A, N, E.

But is ""ROWDY"" valid? Yes.

Another: ""BUOYS"" – but no R? We know R must be included, so we must include R.

Since R must be in the word, we need to include it.

So, words that include R:

- ""ROWDY"": R in position 1, O, W, D, Y
- ""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L
- ""TROPH"": not a word? 
- ""POWER"": P, O, W, E – but E is bad? Yes, E is excluded. So cannot use E.

""POWER"" has E, so invalid.

""ROWTH"" – not common.

""WORST"": W, O, R, S, T. This has R in the third position. Also, avoids A, C, N, E. And it's a common word.

But note: W and O and S and T are all new.

""WORST"" seems good: letters W, O, R, S, T.

Positions: 
1: W
2: O
3: R
4: S
5: T

Since R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we are putting it in position 3, that might be good to test if R is at position 3.

Also, this covers four new consonants and one vowel (O).

Alternatively, we could try a word that places R in position 1? Like ""ROBOT"" – but B and T? But we might want to avoid repeating O twice? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has O twice? O at position 2 and 4? But also, we have two O's? The word ""ROBOT"" has O twice? Actually, no: ROBOT is R-O-B-O-T, so two O's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. The secret word might have duplicates? The rules don't specify, but typically Wordle allows duplicate letters? Actually, in Wordle the secret word might have duplicate letters.

But since we don't know, it's okay? But also, we haven't tested for duplicates? However, in this case, using ""ROBOT"" would mean: R, O, B, O, T. But we are using O twice? That might not be efficient because we are testing the same letter twice? Also, B is an uncommon letter?

Perhaps a word with unique letters is better for getting more information.

So, ""WORST"" has unique letters: W, O, R, S, T.

That's probably better.

Another word: ""SPORT"" – S, P, O, R, T. Also unique letters? S, P, O, R, T – yes. But R is in the fourth position? Position: S (1), P (2), O (3), R (4), T (5). So R in position 4.

Compare ""WORST"" and ""SPORT"": both are good. But ""WORST"" includes W, while ""SPORT"" includes P. W is less common than P? Actually, P is more common.

But we want to test frequent letters? In English, S and T are very common.

Given that, perhaps ""SPORT"" is good? Or ""TROIS"" – that might not be English? Better stick with common words.

I think ""WORST"" is fine.

Another common one: ""STORM"" – S, T, O, R, M. But again, R in position 4? Wait: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So R in position 4.

But ""WORST"" has R in position 3.

Given that we know R must be in a position other than 2, let's choose a position arbitrarily? Since position 1,3,4,5 are possibilities, we could pick one to test a specific position? But I don't think that's necessary? Covering more letters is more important.

I will go with ""WORST"" because it covers the common letters W, O, R, S, T? Wait, W is not that common. Another alternative: ""STROLL"" – too long.

Another: ""TULIP"" – no R? Must include R.

So, I think ""WORST"" is acceptable.

Alternative: ""PRISM"" – P, R, I, S, M. That is also good: P, R, I, S, M. And R in position 2? Position: P(1), R(2) – but wait: in the previous guess, R was in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. So we know R is not in position 2. Therefore, if we put R in position 2 again, it would again be wrong? Feedback would tell us that it is in the word but wrong position again? Which doesn't give new information about R's position? Actually, no: we know it's not in position 2, so we don't need to test position 2 again.

In the feedback, we learned that R is in the word but not in the second position. So we should avoid placing R in position 2.

""PRISM"" has R in position 2: 
Position 1: P
Position 2: R -> but this position was already tested (second position) and found to be incorrect? So it would be inefficient.

Therefore, we should avoid placing R in position 2.

Thus, ""WORST"" is okay: R is in position 3.

""SPORT"" is okay: R in position 4.

I also thought of ""DIRTY"": D, I, R, T, Y. R is in position 3? Position: D, I, R, T, Y – yes, position 3.

Another: ""GIRLY"" – G, I, R, L, Y – R in position 3.

But I think words like ""WORST"", ""SPORT"", ""DIRTY"" are fine.

Let me choose ""WORST"". I think it's a valid word.

So, I'll go with ""worst"".

Thus, second guess is ""worst"".

But let's confirm: We must include R because we know it's in the word, and we do: at position 3? Wait: WORST is:

W O R S T

Position:
1: W
2: O
3: R
4: S
5: T

R is at 3rd position? Yes.

And it avoids C, A, N, E.

So, we hope to get feedback on W, O, R, S, T.

After this, we can narrow down.

Wait: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have information either way? So it's okay.

So, my guess: ""worst""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as X).
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked as -).

Therefore, the new guess must:
- Include R (since it is confirmed in the word), but avoid placing it in the second position.
- Exclude the letters C, A, N, E.
- Introduce new letters to maximize information gain.

A strong choice is ""WORST"" because:
- It includes R in the third position (avoiding position 2).
- It avoids C, A, N, E.
- It tests four new common letters: W, O, S, T, maximizing potential feedback.

Now, submit this guess.

- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is the second letter and feedback says wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Therefore, the secret word includes R, and excludes C, A, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, A, N, E (the bad letters)
- Includes R, but not in the second position (since in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was wrong)
- We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Since R is in the word, we should place R in a different position. Possible positions for R: 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th.

We also need to consider other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (since A and E are out). We might also include common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

Let me think of a word that includes R in a position other than second and avoids the bad letters (C, A, N, E).

Possible words:
- Try words that have R in the first position? Or third? etc.

Common possibilities: 
- Words starting with R: but we don't know if R can be at the start. But feedback only said R is present and not in position 2, so it could be in any other position.

We should also try to cover more letters. Since we have eliminated four letters (C, A, N, E) and know R is included, we have 21 letters left to consider.

I think a good strategy is to choose a word that uses as many of the remaining common letters as possible.

Common consonants beyond R: T, S, L, D, M, etc.

Let's try to pick a word that has R and four other new letters.

For example:
- ""ROTIS"" – but that's not very common? Actually, ""ROTIS"" might not be a word. 
- How about ""ROAST"" – but A is bad, so no, because we know A is not in the word. Similarly, we must avoid A.

Wait, we must avoid A? Feedback said A: x – so A is not in the word.

So avoiding: C, A, N, E.

Possible words: 
- We might try ""SPRIG"" – but let's see: S, P, R, I, G. That uses R not in the second position? We can choose.

However, we don't know the positions, so we might place R in a different spot.

Another idea: since R must be somewhere else, let us try R in position 1? Then we can test if R is at the beginning.

But note: we don't want to reuse bad letters.

Let me list possibilities: The word cannot have A, C, N, E.

Consider: Words with R and common letters like S, T, L, I, O, etc.

I think ""TRYST"" might not be ideal because it has repeated T? Or ""ROOMS"" – again, has O and M and S? But we don't know about O or M.

Actually, I recall that in Wordle, some good second guesses after eliminating several vowels might be words like ""PIOUS"" or ""MURKY"", but we have specific constraints.

Another constraint: the word must be 5 letters and in English.

Let me try to come up with a word that contains R and avoids the bad letters. Also, we want to test new letters.

Possible word: ""ROWDY"" – this has R, O, W, D, Y. But R is in the first position? That's fine. Avoids C, A, N, E.

But is ""ROWDY"" valid? Yes.

Another: ""BUOYS"" – but no R? We know R must be included, so we must include R.

Since R must be in the word, we need to include it.

So, words that include R:

- ""ROWDY"": R in position 1, O, W, D, Y
- ""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L
- ""TROPH"": not a word? 
- ""POWER"": P, O, W, E – but E is bad? Yes, E is excluded. So cannot use E.

""POWER"" has E, so invalid.

""ROWTH"" – not common.

""WORST"": W, O, R, S, T. This has R in the third position. Also, avoids A, C, N, E. And it's a common word.

But note: W and O and S and T are all new.

""WORST"" seems good: letters W, O, R, S, T.

Positions: 
1: W
2: O
3: R
4: S
5: T

Since R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we are putting it in position 3, that might be good to test if R is at position 3.

Also, this covers four new consonants and one vowel (O).

Alternatively, we could try a word that places R in position 1? Like ""ROBOT"" – but B and T? But we might want to avoid repeating O twice? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has O twice? O at position 2 and 4? But also, we have two O's? The word ""ROBOT"" has O twice? Actually, no: ROBOT is R-O-B-O-T, so two O's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. The secret word might have duplicates? The rules don't specify, but typically Wordle allows duplicate letters? Actually, in Wordle the secret word might have duplicate letters.

But since we don't know, it's okay? But also, we haven't tested for duplicates? However, in this case, using ""ROBOT"" would mean: R, O, B, O, T. But we are using O twice? That might not be efficient because we are testing the same letter twice? Also, B is an uncommon letter?

Perhaps a word with unique letters is better for getting more information.

So, ""WORST"" has unique letters: W, O, R, S, T.

That's probably better.

Another word: ""SPORT"" – S, P, O, R, T. Also unique letters? S, P, O, R, T – yes. But R is in the fourth position? Position: S (1), P (2), O (3), R (4), T (5). So R in position 4.

Compare ""WORST"" and ""SPORT"": both are good. But ""WORST"" includes W, while ""SPORT"" includes P. W is less common than P? Actually, P is more common.

But we want to test frequent letters? In English, S and T are very common.

Given that, perhaps ""SPORT"" is good? Or ""TROIS"" – that might not be English? Better stick with common words.

I think ""WORST"" is fine.

Another common one: ""STORM"" – S, T, O, R, M. But again, R in position 4? Wait: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So R in position 4.

But ""WORST"" has R in position 3.

Given that we know R must be in a position other than 2, let's choose a position arbitrarily? Since position 1,3,4,5 are possibilities, we could pick one to test a specific position? But I don't think that's necessary? Covering more letters is more important.

I will go with ""WORST"" because it covers the common letters W, O, R, S, T? Wait, W is not that common. Another alternative: ""STROLL"" – too long.

Another: ""TULIP"" – no R? Must include R.

So, I think ""WORST"" is acceptable.

Alternative: ""PRISM"" – P, R, I, S, M. That is also good: P, R, I, S, M. And R in position 2? Position: P(1), R(2) – but wait: in the previous guess, R was in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. So we know R is not in position 2. Therefore, if we put R in position 2 again, it would again be wrong? Feedback would tell us that it is in the word but wrong position again? Which doesn't give new information about R's position? Actually, no: we know it's not in position 2, so we don't need to test position 2 again.

In the feedback, we learned that R is in the word but not in the second position. So we should avoid placing R in position 2.

""PRISM"" has R in position 2: 
Position 1: P
Position 2: R -> but this position was already tested (second position) and found to be incorrect? So it would be inefficient.

Therefore, we should avoid placing R in position 2.

Thus, ""WORST"" is okay: R is in position 3.

""SPORT"" is okay: R in position 4.

I also thought of ""DIRTY"": D, I, R, T, Y. R is in position 3? Position: D, I, R, T, Y – yes, position 3.

Another: ""GIRLY"" – G, I, R, L, Y – R in position 3.

But I think words like ""WORST"", ""SPORT"", ""DIRTY"" are fine.

Let me choose ""WORST"". I think it's a valid word.

So, I'll go with ""worst"".

Thus, second guess is ""worst"".

But let's confirm: We must include R because we know it's in the word, and we do: at position 3? Wait: WORST is:

W O R S T

Position:
1: W
2: O
3: R
4: S
5: T

R is at 3rd position? Yes.

And it avoids C, A, N, E.

So, we hope to get feedback on W, O, R, S, T.

After this, we can narrow down.

Wait: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have information either way? So it's okay.

So, my guess: ""worst""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as X).
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked as -).

Therefore, the new guess must:
- Include R (since it is confirmed in the word), but avoid placing it in the second position.
- Exclude the letters C, A, N, E.
- Introduce new letters to maximize information gain.

A strong choice is ""WORST"" because:
- It includes R in the third position (avoiding position 2).
- It avoids C, A, N, E.
- It tests four new common letters: W, O, S, T, maximizing potential feedback.

Now, submit this guess.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""worst""
- W: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct letter in the correct position, so R is the third letter of the secret word)
- S: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- T: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- R is confirmed to be the third letter (position 3) of the secret word.
- S is in the word, but not in the fourth position (where it was in ""worst"").
- W, O, T are not in the word.

So, combining all information:

Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, W, O, T
Letters in the word: R (at position 3) and S (somewhere, but not position 4)

We also know that R is fixed at position 3.

Now, the secret word has the form: _ _ R _ _

We need to find a word that:
- Has R in the third position.
- Contains S, but not in the fourth position.
- Does not contain C, A, N, E, W, O, T.

We have to choose a new guess that tests possible letters for the remaining positions.

Remaining positions: 1, 2, 4, 5.

We know S is in the word but not in position 4, so S must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 5.

We should also consider other common letters that haven't been tested yet.

List of untested letters (excluding the known bad ones and the known good ones):

Alphabet minus known bad: C, A, N, E, W, O, T
Minus known good: R, S

So, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

But we need to form a valid 5-letter word.

We also know S must be placed in one of positions 1, 2, or 5 (since not 4, and not 3 because R is there).

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Possible strategies:

1. Since S is known to be in the word, we can try to place S in a different position to narrow down its location. For example, if we put S in position 1, we can see if it's correct or not.

2. We can also try to test other common letters to see if they are in the word.

Given that we have only 4 guesses left, we need to be efficient.

Let me think of words that have R in the third position and S in position 1, 2, or 5, and use other untested letters.

For example:
- If S is in position 1: words like S_ R _ _
- If S is in position 2: words like _ S R _ _
- If S is in position 5: words like _ _ R _ S

We also need to avoid the bad letters.

Let's list possible words for each case:

Case 1: S at position 1
- The word would be S _ R _ _
- Avoid C,A,N,E,W,O,T
- Possible words: 
  - ""SPRIG"" (but G is untested, and I is untested) - valid word? SPRIG is a word.
  - ""SPRUE"" (but E is bad) - invalid.
  - ""SPRUG"" - not a word.
  - ""SHRIK"" - not common? Shrik is not a word, but ""shrink"" is 6 letters.
  - ""SHRUB"" - S H R U B -> positions: S(1), H(2), R(3), U(4), B(5). Avoids bad letters? H, U, B are untested. But ""shrub"" is a word.

Case 2: S at position 2
- _ S R _ _
- Words: 
  - ""USHER"" - but U, S, H, E, R -> E is bad, so invalid.
  - ""ASHER"" - A is bad.
  - ""ISLET"" - but T is bad and position: I S L E T -> E and T bad, and R not at 3? Not matching pattern.
  - We need R at 3, so second letter S and third R: so pattern _ S R _ _
  - ""USURP"" - U S U R P -> but U repeated? And positions: U(1), S(2), U(3) but we need R at 3, so not.
  - ""MUSHY"" - M U S H Y -> S at 3? No, S is at 3? M(1), U(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5) -> but we need R at 3, not S. So invalid.
  - Actually, we need the third letter to be R, so the word must be _ S R _ _
  - Examples: ""ASPRO"" - A bad. ""BESET"" - E bad. ""DISCO"" - D I S C O -> C and O bad. 
  - ""GYROS"" - G Y R O S -> O is bad. 
  - ""LYRES"" - L Y R E S -> E bad.
  - It's hard to find words with _ S R _ _ that avoid bad letters.

Case 3: S at position 5
- _ _ R _ S
- Words:
  - ""BARNS"" - A and N bad.
  - ""FIRMS"" - F I R M S -> avoids bad letters? F, I, M are untested. ""firms"" is a word.
  - ""GIRDS"" - G I R D S -> avoids bad letters. ""girds"" is a word.
  - ""HURDS"" - H U R D S -> ""hurds"" is not common, but ""hurls"" has L? ""hurls"" is H U R L S -> avoids bad letters? H, U, L untested. ""hurls"" is a word.
  - ""PURIS"" - P U R I S -> ""puris"" is a word? It might be, but less common.

Given the difficulty with position 2, and since we have to test S, perhaps we should try to place S in position 1 or 5 to get feedback on its position.

Also, we can choose a word that has S in a new position and tests other common letters.

Another idea: since we know R is fixed at 3, and S is somewhere else, we can try a word that has S in position 1 and then test other vowels or common consonants.

For example, ""SHRUB"" as I thought earlier: S H R U B

But let's check the feedback we would get: 
- If we guess ""SHRUB"":
  - S: if it's in the word and correct position? We don't know if S is at position 1.
  - H: new letter
  - R: already correct, so ✓
  - U: new letter
  - B: new letter

But we are not sure about S at position 1.

Alternatively, we could try ""SPRIG"": S P R I G

But P, I, G are new.

However, we have to avoid using too many letters that might not be in the word.

Another common word: ""SHIRE"" - but E is bad, so no.

""SHIRK"": S H I R K -> positions: S(1), H(2), I(3) but R is at 3? No, I is at 3, R at 4? So not, because R must be at 3.

We need R at position 3.

So, ""SHRUG"": S H R U G -> this is good: S(1), H(2), R(3), U(4), G(5). Avoids bad letters.

""SHRUG"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""SHRUB"" is also valid.

But ""SHRUG"" has U and G.

We could also consider ""SPRIG"": S P R I G -> S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). Also valid.

Now, which one to choose? Both are good.

But we also have to consider that S might not be at position 1. If we put S at position 1 and it's not, then we get feedback that S is not at 1, so it must be at 2 or 5.

Similarly, if we put S at position 5, we can test that.

But since position 2 is difficult, maybe test position 1 first.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have S in position 4 (which we already know is wrong) and not in position 3 (taken by R), so positions 1,2,5 are possible.

But in our guess, we can place S in one of these to test.

I think ""SHRUG"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more vowels. We have only tested O (which is bad) and A and E (bad), so vowels left are I, U, and sometimes Y.

So, including I or U might be good.

""SPRIG"" has I, which is a vowel.

""SHRUG"" has U.

Both are fine.

I'll go with ""SHRUG"" for now.

But we also have the option to not fix S at position 1 and instead put it in position 5? For example, ""PURIS"" or ""FIRMS"", but let's see.

Another idea: since we know S is in the word, and we have to find its position, we can choose a word that has S in a position we haven't tested, and also tests other common letters.

But we have positions 1,2,5 to test for S.

Position 2 might be rare? So testing position 1 or 5 might be better.

I think ""SHRUG"" is a solid choice.

So, I'll guess ""SHRUG"".

But let's double-check the bad letters: C, A, N, E, W, O, T. ""SHRUG"" has S, H, R, U, G. None of these are bad, so it's okay.

R is at position 3, which is correct.

S is at position 1, which we are testing.

So, feedback will tell us if S is at position 1 or not, and also about H, U, G.

If S is at position 1, we get a ✓, else if it's in the word but wrong position, we get a -, but since we know S is in the word, if it's not at 1, it must be at 2 or 5.

Similarly, for other letters.

So, I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, third guess: ""SHRUG""
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - This indicates that R is in the secret word but not in position 2. C, A, N, and E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: ""worst""** → Feedback: W(x), O(x), R(✓), S(-), T(x)  
  - This confirms R is in position 3 (since it's marked correct). S is in the word but not in position 4. W, O, and T are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: The word has R in position 3: `_ _ R _ _`.
- **Confirmed letters**: 
  - R (position 3) and S (somewhere, but not position 4).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E, W, O, T (not in the word).
- **Remaining positions to solve**: 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- **S must be in position 1, 2, or 5** (since it's not in 3 or 4).
- **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (we need to test these to gather more information).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- **Include S** in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to narrow down its location.
- **Avoid eliminated letters** (C, A, N, E, W, O, T).
- **Test new common letters** (e.g., H, U, G, I, L, D) to maximize feedback.
- **Prioritize words with high-frequency consonants and vowels** (e.g., S, H, L, D, U, I) to increase the chance of hits.

A strong choice is **""SHRUG""**:
- **Structure**: S H R U G
  - S in position 1 (tests if S is in the correct starting position).
  - H in position 2 (new letter test).
  - R in position 3 (confirmed correct, so it will be marked ✓).
  - U in position 4 (new vowel test, as we haven't checked U yet).
  - G in position 5 (new consonant test).
- **Why this word?**
  - It tests S in position 1, which is one of the possible locations for S (if S is not here, it must be in position 2 or 5).
  - It introduces three new common letters (H, U, G), which are untested and could appear in the secret word.
  - It avoids all eliminated letters and uses distinct characters for efficient feedback.
  - If S is not in position 1, the feedback will still help locate S (e.g., if S is marked ""-"", it must be in position 2 or 5).

<guess>shrug</guess>",shrug,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""worst""
- W: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct letter in the correct position, so R is the third letter of the secret word)
- S: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- T: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- R is confirmed to be the third letter (position 3) of the secret word.
- S is in the word, but not in the fourth position (where it was in ""worst"").
- W, O, T are not in the word.

So, combining all information:

Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, W, O, T
Letters in the word: R (at position 3) and S (somewhere, but not position 4)

We also know that R is fixed at position 3.

Now, the secret word has the form: _ _ R _ _

We need to find a word that:
- Has R in the third position.
- Contains S, but not in the fourth position.
- Does not contain C, A, N, E, W, O, T.

We have to choose a new guess that tests possible letters for the remaining positions.

Remaining positions: 1, 2, 4, 5.

We know S is in the word but not in position 4, so S must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 5.

We should also consider other common letters that haven't been tested yet.

List of untested letters (excluding the known bad ones and the known good ones):

Alphabet minus known bad: C, A, N, E, W, O, T
Minus known good: R, S

So, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

But we need to form a valid 5-letter word.

We also know S must be placed in one of positions 1, 2, or 5 (since not 4, and not 3 because R is there).

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Possible strategies:

1. Since S is known to be in the word, we can try to place S in a different position to narrow down its location. For example, if we put S in position 1, we can see if it's correct or not.

2. We can also try to test other common letters to see if they are in the word.

Given that we have only 4 guesses left, we need to be efficient.

Let me think of words that have R in the third position and S in position 1, 2, or 5, and use other untested letters.

For example:
- If S is in position 1: words like S_ R _ _
- If S is in position 2: words like _ S R _ _
- If S is in position 5: words like _ _ R _ S

We also need to avoid the bad letters.

Let's list possible words for each case:

Case 1: S at position 1
- The word would be S _ R _ _
- Avoid C,A,N,E,W,O,T
- Possible words: 
  - ""SPRIG"" (but G is untested, and I is untested) - valid word? SPRIG is a word.
  - ""SPRUE"" (but E is bad) - invalid.
  - ""SPRUG"" - not a word.
  - ""SHRIK"" - not common? Shrik is not a word, but ""shrink"" is 6 letters.
  - ""SHRUB"" - S H R U B -> positions: S(1), H(2), R(3), U(4), B(5). Avoids bad letters? H, U, B are untested. But ""shrub"" is a word.

Case 2: S at position 2
- _ S R _ _
- Words: 
  - ""USHER"" - but U, S, H, E, R -> E is bad, so invalid.
  - ""ASHER"" - A is bad.
  - ""ISLET"" - but T is bad and position: I S L E T -> E and T bad, and R not at 3? Not matching pattern.
  - We need R at 3, so second letter S and third R: so pattern _ S R _ _
  - ""USURP"" - U S U R P -> but U repeated? And positions: U(1), S(2), U(3) but we need R at 3, so not.
  - ""MUSHY"" - M U S H Y -> S at 3? No, S is at 3? M(1), U(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5) -> but we need R at 3, not S. So invalid.
  - Actually, we need the third letter to be R, so the word must be _ S R _ _
  - Examples: ""ASPRO"" - A bad. ""BESET"" - E bad. ""DISCO"" - D I S C O -> C and O bad. 
  - ""GYROS"" - G Y R O S -> O is bad. 
  - ""LYRES"" - L Y R E S -> E bad.
  - It's hard to find words with _ S R _ _ that avoid bad letters.

Case 3: S at position 5
- _ _ R _ S
- Words:
  - ""BARNS"" - A and N bad.
  - ""FIRMS"" - F I R M S -> avoids bad letters? F, I, M are untested. ""firms"" is a word.
  - ""GIRDS"" - G I R D S -> avoids bad letters. ""girds"" is a word.
  - ""HURDS"" - H U R D S -> ""hurds"" is not common, but ""hurls"" has L? ""hurls"" is H U R L S -> avoids bad letters? H, U, L untested. ""hurls"" is a word.
  - ""PURIS"" - P U R I S -> ""puris"" is a word? It might be, but less common.

Given the difficulty with position 2, and since we have to test S, perhaps we should try to place S in position 1 or 5 to get feedback on its position.

Also, we can choose a word that has S in a new position and tests other common letters.

Another idea: since we know R is fixed at 3, and S is somewhere else, we can try a word that has S in position 1 and then test other vowels or common consonants.

For example, ""SHRUB"" as I thought earlier: S H R U B

But let's check the feedback we would get: 
- If we guess ""SHRUB"":
  - S: if it's in the word and correct position? We don't know if S is at position 1.
  - H: new letter
  - R: already correct, so ✓
  - U: new letter
  - B: new letter

But we are not sure about S at position 1.

Alternatively, we could try ""SPRIG"": S P R I G

But P, I, G are new.

However, we have to avoid using too many letters that might not be in the word.

Another common word: ""SHIRE"" - but E is bad, so no.

""SHIRK"": S H I R K -> positions: S(1), H(2), I(3) but R is at 3? No, I is at 3, R at 4? So not, because R must be at 3.

We need R at position 3.

So, ""SHRUG"": S H R U G -> this is good: S(1), H(2), R(3), U(4), G(5). Avoids bad letters.

""SHRUG"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""SHRUB"" is also valid.

But ""SHRUG"" has U and G.

We could also consider ""SPRIG"": S P R I G -> S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). Also valid.

Now, which one to choose? Both are good.

But we also have to consider that S might not be at position 1. If we put S at position 1 and it's not, then we get feedback that S is not at 1, so it must be at 2 or 5.

Similarly, if we put S at position 5, we can test that.

But since position 2 is difficult, maybe test position 1 first.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have S in position 4 (which we already know is wrong) and not in position 3 (taken by R), so positions 1,2,5 are possible.

But in our guess, we can place S in one of these to test.

I think ""SHRUG"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more vowels. We have only tested O (which is bad) and A and E (bad), so vowels left are I, U, and sometimes Y.

So, including I or U might be good.

""SPRIG"" has I, which is a vowel.

""SHRUG"" has U.

Both are fine.

I'll go with ""SHRUG"" for now.

But we also have the option to not fix S at position 1 and instead put it in position 5? For example, ""PURIS"" or ""FIRMS"", but let's see.

Another idea: since we know S is in the word, and we have to find its position, we can choose a word that has S in a position we haven't tested, and also tests other common letters.

But we have positions 1,2,5 to test for S.

Position 2 might be rare? So testing position 1 or 5 might be better.

I think ""SHRUG"" is a solid choice.

So, I'll guess ""SHRUG"".

But let's double-check the bad letters: C, A, N, E, W, O, T. ""SHRUG"" has S, H, R, U, G. None of these are bad, so it's okay.

R is at position 3, which is correct.

S is at position 1, which we are testing.

So, feedback will tell us if S is at position 1 or not, and also about H, U, G.

If S is at position 1, we get a ✓, else if it's in the word but wrong position, we get a -, but since we know S is in the word, if it's not at 1, it must be at 2 or 5.

Similarly, for other letters.

So, I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, third guess: ""SHRUG""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - This indicates that R is in the secret word but not in position 2. C, A, N, and E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: ""worst""** → Feedback: W(x), O(x), R(✓), S(-), T(x)  
  - This confirms R is in position 3 (since it's marked correct). S is in the word but not in position 4. W, O, and T are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: The word has R in position 3: `_ _ R _ _`.
- **Confirmed letters**: 
  - R (position 3) and S (somewhere, but not position 4).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E, W, O, T (not in the word).
- **Remaining positions to solve**: 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- **S must be in position 1, 2, or 5** (since it's not in 3 or 4).
- **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (we need to test these to gather more information).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- **Include S** in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to narrow down its location.
- **Avoid eliminated letters** (C, A, N, E, W, O, T).
- **Test new common letters** (e.g., H, U, G, I, L, D) to maximize feedback.
- **Prioritize words with high-frequency consonants and vowels** (e.g., S, H, L, D, U, I) to increase the chance of hits.

A strong choice is **""SHRUG""**:
- **Structure**: S H R U G
  - S in position 1 (tests if S is in the correct starting position).
  - H in position 2 (new letter test).
  - R in position 3 (confirmed correct, so it will be marked ✓).
  - U in position 4 (new vowel test, as we haven't checked U yet).
  - G in position 5 (new consonant test).
- **Why this word?**
  - It tests S in position 1, which is one of the possible locations for S (if S is not here, it must be in position 2 or 5).
  - It introduces three new common letters (H, U, G), which are untested and could appear in the secret word.
  - It avoids all eliminated letters and uses distinct characters for efficient feedback.
  - If S is not in position 1, the feedback will still help locate S (e.g., if S is marked ""-"", it must be in position 2 or 5).",Guess 3: shrug -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) R(✓) U(-) G(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the secret word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is the second letter and feedback says wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Therefore, the secret word includes R, and excludes C, A, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain C, A, N, E (the bad letters)
- Includes R, but not in the second position (since in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was wrong)
- We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Since R is in the word, we should place R in a different position. Possible positions for R: 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th.

We also need to consider other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (since A and E are out). We might also include common consonants like T, S, L, etc.

Let me think of a word that includes R in a position other than second and avoids the bad letters (C, A, N, E).

Possible words:
- Try words that have R in the first position? Or third? etc.

Common possibilities: 
- Words starting with R: but we don't know if R can be at the start. But feedback only said R is present and not in position 2, so it could be in any other position.

We should also try to cover more letters. Since we have eliminated four letters (C, A, N, E) and know R is included, we have 21 letters left to consider.

I think a good strategy is to choose a word that uses as many of the remaining common letters as possible.

Common consonants beyond R: T, S, L, D, M, etc.

Let's try to pick a word that has R and four other new letters.

For example:
- ""ROTIS"" – but that's not very common? Actually, ""ROTIS"" might not be a word. 
- How about ""ROAST"" – but A is bad, so no, because we know A is not in the word. Similarly, we must avoid A.

Wait, we must avoid A? Feedback said A: x – so A is not in the word.

So avoiding: C, A, N, E.

Possible words: 
- We might try ""SPRIG"" – but let's see: S, P, R, I, G. That uses R not in the second position? We can choose.

However, we don't know the positions, so we might place R in a different spot.

Another idea: since R must be somewhere else, let us try R in position 1? Then we can test if R is at the beginning.

But note: we don't want to reuse bad letters.

Let me list possibilities: The word cannot have A, C, N, E.

Consider: Words with R and common letters like S, T, L, I, O, etc.

I think ""TRYST"" might not be ideal because it has repeated T? Or ""ROOMS"" – again, has O and M and S? But we don't know about O or M.

Actually, I recall that in Wordle, some good second guesses after eliminating several vowels might be words like ""PIOUS"" or ""MURKY"", but we have specific constraints.

Another constraint: the word must be 5 letters and in English.

Let me try to come up with a word that contains R and avoids the bad letters. Also, we want to test new letters.

Possible word: ""ROWDY"" – this has R, O, W, D, Y. But R is in the first position? That's fine. Avoids C, A, N, E.

But is ""ROWDY"" valid? Yes.

Another: ""BUOYS"" – but no R? We know R must be included, so we must include R.

Since R must be in the word, we need to include it.

So, words that include R:

- ""ROWDY"": R in position 1, O, W, D, Y
- ""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L
- ""TROPH"": not a word? 
- ""POWER"": P, O, W, E – but E is bad? Yes, E is excluded. So cannot use E.

""POWER"" has E, so invalid.

""ROWTH"" – not common.

""WORST"": W, O, R, S, T. This has R in the third position. Also, avoids A, C, N, E. And it's a common word.

But note: W and O and S and T are all new.

""WORST"" seems good: letters W, O, R, S, T.

Positions: 
1: W
2: O
3: R
4: S
5: T

Since R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we are putting it in position 3, that might be good to test if R is at position 3.

Also, this covers four new consonants and one vowel (O).

Alternatively, we could try a word that places R in position 1? Like ""ROBOT"" – but B and T? But we might want to avoid repeating O twice? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has O twice? O at position 2 and 4? But also, we have two O's? The word ""ROBOT"" has O twice? Actually, no: ROBOT is R-O-B-O-T, so two O's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. The secret word might have duplicates? The rules don't specify, but typically Wordle allows duplicate letters? Actually, in Wordle the secret word might have duplicate letters.

But since we don't know, it's okay? But also, we haven't tested for duplicates? However, in this case, using ""ROBOT"" would mean: R, O, B, O, T. But we are using O twice? That might not be efficient because we are testing the same letter twice? Also, B is an uncommon letter?

Perhaps a word with unique letters is better for getting more information.

So, ""WORST"" has unique letters: W, O, R, S, T.

That's probably better.

Another word: ""SPORT"" – S, P, O, R, T. Also unique letters? S, P, O, R, T – yes. But R is in the fourth position? Position: S (1), P (2), O (3), R (4), T (5). So R in position 4.

Compare ""WORST"" and ""SPORT"": both are good. But ""WORST"" includes W, while ""SPORT"" includes P. W is less common than P? Actually, P is more common.

But we want to test frequent letters? In English, S and T are very common.

Given that, perhaps ""SPORT"" is good? Or ""TROIS"" – that might not be English? Better stick with common words.

I think ""WORST"" is fine.

Another common one: ""STORM"" – S, T, O, R, M. But again, R in position 4? Wait: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So R in position 4.

But ""WORST"" has R in position 3.

Given that we know R must be in a position other than 2, let's choose a position arbitrarily? Since position 1,3,4,5 are possibilities, we could pick one to test a specific position? But I don't think that's necessary? Covering more letters is more important.

I will go with ""WORST"" because it covers the common letters W, O, R, S, T? Wait, W is not that common. Another alternative: ""STROLL"" – too long.

Another: ""TULIP"" – no R? Must include R.

So, I think ""WORST"" is acceptable.

Alternative: ""PRISM"" – P, R, I, S, M. That is also good: P, R, I, S, M. And R in position 2? Position: P(1), R(2) – but wait: in the previous guess, R was in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. So we know R is not in position 2. Therefore, if we put R in position 2 again, it would again be wrong? Feedback would tell us that it is in the word but wrong position again? Which doesn't give new information about R's position? Actually, no: we know it's not in position 2, so we don't need to test position 2 again.

In the feedback, we learned that R is in the word but not in the second position. So we should avoid placing R in position 2.

""PRISM"" has R in position 2: 
Position 1: P
Position 2: R -> but this position was already tested (second position) and found to be incorrect? So it would be inefficient.

Therefore, we should avoid placing R in position 2.

Thus, ""WORST"" is okay: R is in position 3.

""SPORT"" is okay: R in position 4.

I also thought of ""DIRTY"": D, I, R, T, Y. R is in position 3? Position: D, I, R, T, Y – yes, position 3.

Another: ""GIRLY"" – G, I, R, L, Y – R in position 3.

But I think words like ""WORST"", ""SPORT"", ""DIRTY"" are fine.

Let me choose ""WORST"". I think it's a valid word.

So, I'll go with ""worst"".

Thus, second guess is ""worst"".

But let's confirm: We must include R because we know it's in the word, and we do: at position 3? Wait: WORST is:

W O R S T

Position:
1: W
2: O
3: R
4: S
5: T

R is at 3rd position? Yes.

And it avoids C, A, N, E.

So, we hope to get feedback on W, O, R, S, T.

After this, we can narrow down.

Wait: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have information either way? So it's okay.

So, my guess: ""worst""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as X).
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked as -).

Therefore, the new guess must:
- Include R (since it is confirmed in the word), but avoid placing it in the second position.
- Exclude the letters C, A, N, E.
- Introduce new letters to maximize information gain.

A strong choice is ""WORST"" because:
- It includes R in the third position (avoiding position 2).
- It avoids C, A, N, E.
- It tests four new common letters: W, O, S, T, maximizing potential feedback.

Now, submit this guess.

<guess>worst</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: worst -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(x) R(✓) S(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""worst""
- W: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct letter in the correct position, so R is the third letter of the secret word)
- S: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- T: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- R is confirmed to be the third letter (position 3) of the secret word.
- S is in the word, but not in the fourth position (where it was in ""worst"").
- W, O, T are not in the word.

So, combining all information:

Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, W, O, T
Letters in the word: R (at position 3) and S (somewhere, but not position 4)

We also know that R is fixed at position 3.

Now, the secret word has the form: _ _ R _ _

We need to find a word that:
- Has R in the third position.
- Contains S, but not in the fourth position.
- Does not contain C, A, N, E, W, O, T.

We have to choose a new guess that tests possible letters for the remaining positions.

Remaining positions: 1, 2, 4, 5.

We know S is in the word but not in position 4, so S must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 5.

We should also consider other common letters that haven't been tested yet.

List of untested letters (excluding the known bad ones and the known good ones):

Alphabet minus known bad: C, A, N, E, W, O, T
Minus known good: R, S

So, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

But we need to form a valid 5-letter word.

We also know S must be placed in one of positions 1, 2, or 5 (since not 4, and not 3 because R is there).

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Possible strategies:

1. Since S is known to be in the word, we can try to place S in a different position to narrow down its location. For example, if we put S in position 1, we can see if it's correct or not.

2. We can also try to test other common letters to see if they are in the word.

Given that we have only 4 guesses left, we need to be efficient.

Let me think of words that have R in the third position and S in position 1, 2, or 5, and use other untested letters.

For example:
- If S is in position 1: words like S_ R _ _
- If S is in position 2: words like _ S R _ _
- If S is in position 5: words like _ _ R _ S

We also need to avoid the bad letters.

Let's list possible words for each case:

Case 1: S at position 1
- The word would be S _ R _ _
- Avoid C,A,N,E,W,O,T
- Possible words: 
  - ""SPRIG"" (but G is untested, and I is untested) - valid word? SPRIG is a word.
  - ""SPRUE"" (but E is bad) - invalid.
  - ""SPRUG"" - not a word.
  - ""SHRIK"" - not common? Shrik is not a word, but ""shrink"" is 6 letters.
  - ""SHRUB"" - S H R U B -> positions: S(1), H(2), R(3), U(4), B(5). Avoids bad letters? H, U, B are untested. But ""shrub"" is a word.

Case 2: S at position 2
- _ S R _ _
- Words: 
  - ""USHER"" - but U, S, H, E, R -> E is bad, so invalid.
  - ""ASHER"" - A is bad.
  - ""ISLET"" - but T is bad and position: I S L E T -> E and T bad, and R not at 3? Not matching pattern.
  - We need R at 3, so second letter S and third R: so pattern _ S R _ _
  - ""USURP"" - U S U R P -> but U repeated? And positions: U(1), S(2), U(3) but we need R at 3, so not.
  - ""MUSHY"" - M U S H Y -> S at 3? No, S is at 3? M(1), U(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5) -> but we need R at 3, not S. So invalid.
  - Actually, we need the third letter to be R, so the word must be _ S R _ _
  - Examples: ""ASPRO"" - A bad. ""BESET"" - E bad. ""DISCO"" - D I S C O -> C and O bad. 
  - ""GYROS"" - G Y R O S -> O is bad. 
  - ""LYRES"" - L Y R E S -> E bad.
  - It's hard to find words with _ S R _ _ that avoid bad letters.

Case 3: S at position 5
- _ _ R _ S
- Words:
  - ""BARNS"" - A and N bad.
  - ""FIRMS"" - F I R M S -> avoids bad letters? F, I, M are untested. ""firms"" is a word.
  - ""GIRDS"" - G I R D S -> avoids bad letters. ""girds"" is a word.
  - ""HURDS"" - H U R D S -> ""hurds"" is not common, but ""hurls"" has L? ""hurls"" is H U R L S -> avoids bad letters? H, U, L untested. ""hurls"" is a word.
  - ""PURIS"" - P U R I S -> ""puris"" is a word? It might be, but less common.

Given the difficulty with position 2, and since we have to test S, perhaps we should try to place S in position 1 or 5 to get feedback on its position.

Also, we can choose a word that has S in a new position and tests other common letters.

Another idea: since we know R is fixed at 3, and S is somewhere else, we can try a word that has S in position 1 and then test other vowels or common consonants.

For example, ""SHRUB"" as I thought earlier: S H R U B

But let's check the feedback we would get: 
- If we guess ""SHRUB"":
  - S: if it's in the word and correct position? We don't know if S is at position 1.
  - H: new letter
  - R: already correct, so ✓
  - U: new letter
  - B: new letter

But we are not sure about S at position 1.

Alternatively, we could try ""SPRIG"": S P R I G

But P, I, G are new.

However, we have to avoid using too many letters that might not be in the word.

Another common word: ""SHIRE"" - but E is bad, so no.

""SHIRK"": S H I R K -> positions: S(1), H(2), I(3) but R is at 3? No, I is at 3, R at 4? So not, because R must be at 3.

We need R at position 3.

So, ""SHRUG"": S H R U G -> this is good: S(1), H(2), R(3), U(4), G(5). Avoids bad letters.

""SHRUG"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""SHRUB"" is also valid.

But ""SHRUG"" has U and G.

We could also consider ""SPRIG"": S P R I G -> S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). Also valid.

Now, which one to choose? Both are good.

But we also have to consider that S might not be at position 1. If we put S at position 1 and it's not, then we get feedback that S is not at 1, so it must be at 2 or 5.

Similarly, if we put S at position 5, we can test that.

But since position 2 is difficult, maybe test position 1 first.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have S in position 4 (which we already know is wrong) and not in position 3 (taken by R), so positions 1,2,5 are possible.

But in our guess, we can place S in one of these to test.

I think ""SHRUG"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more vowels. We have only tested O (which is bad) and A and E (bad), so vowels left are I, U, and sometimes Y.

So, including I or U might be good.

""SPRIG"" has I, which is a vowel.

""SHRUG"" has U.

Both are fine.

I'll go with ""SHRUG"" for now.

But we also have the option to not fix S at position 1 and instead put it in position 5? For example, ""PURIS"" or ""FIRMS"", but let's see.

Another idea: since we know S is in the word, and we have to find its position, we can choose a word that has S in a position we haven't tested, and also tests other common letters.

But we have positions 1,2,5 to test for S.

Position 2 might be rare? So testing position 1 or 5 might be better.

I think ""SHRUG"" is a solid choice.

So, I'll guess ""SHRUG"".

But let's double-check the bad letters: C, A, N, E, W, O, T. ""SHRUG"" has S, H, R, U, G. None of these are bad, so it's okay.

R is at position 3, which is correct.

S is at position 1, which we are testing.

So, feedback will tell us if S is at position 1 or not, and also about H, U, G.

If S is at position 1, we get a ✓, else if it's in the word but wrong position, we get a -, but since we know S is in the word, if it's not at 1, it must be at 2 or 5.

Similarly, for other letters.

So, I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, third guess: ""SHRUG""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - This indicates that R is in the secret word but not in position 2. C, A, N, and E are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: ""worst""** → Feedback: W(x), O(x), R(✓), S(-), T(x)  
  - This confirms R is in position 3 (since it's marked correct). S is in the word but not in position 4. W, O, and T are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: The word has R in position 3: `_ _ R _ _`.
- **Confirmed letters**: 
  - R (position 3) and S (somewhere, but not position 4).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E, W, O, T (not in the word).
- **Remaining positions to solve**: 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- **S must be in position 1, 2, or 5** (since it's not in 3 or 4).
- **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (we need to test these to gather more information).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- **Include S** in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to narrow down its location.
- **Avoid eliminated letters** (C, A, N, E, W, O, T).
- **Test new common letters** (e.g., H, U, G, I, L, D) to maximize feedback.
- **Prioritize words with high-frequency consonants and vowels** (e.g., S, H, L, D, U, I) to increase the chance of hits.

A strong choice is **""SHRUG""**:
- **Structure**: S H R U G
  - S in position 1 (tests if S is in the correct starting position).
  - H in position 2 (new letter test).
  - R in position 3 (confirmed correct, so it will be marked ✓).
  - U in position 4 (new vowel test, as we haven't checked U yet).
  - G in position 5 (new consonant test).
- **Why this word?**
  - It tests S in position 1, which is one of the possible locations for S (if S is not here, it must be in position 2 or 5).
  - It introduces three new common letters (H, U, G), which are untested and could appear in the secret word.
  - It avoids all eliminated letters and uses distinct characters for efficient feedback.
  - If S is not in position 1, the feedback will still help locate S (e.g., if S is marked ""-"", it must be in position 2 or 5).

We can choose.\n\nHowever, we don\'t know the positions, so we might place R in a different spot.\n\nAnother idea: since R must be somewhere else, let us try R in position 1? Then we can test if R is at the beginning.\n\nBut note: we don\'t want to reuse bad letters.\n\nLet me list possibilities: The word cannot have A, C, N, E.\n\nConsider: Words with R and common letters like S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\nI think ""TRYST"" might not be ideal because it has repeated T? Or ""ROOMS"" – again, has O and M and S? But we don\'t know about O or M.\n\nActually, I recall that in Wordle, some good second guesses after eliminating several vowels might be words like ""PIOUS"" or ""MURKY"", but we have specific constraints.\n\nAnother constraint: the word must be 5 letters and in English.\n\nLet me try to come up with a word that contains R and avoids the bad letters. Also, we want to test new letters.\n\nPossible word: ""ROWDY"" – this has R, O, W, D, Y. But R is in the first position? That\'s fine. Avoids C, A, N, E.\n\nBut is ""ROWDY"" valid? Yes.\n\nAnother: ""BUOYS"" – but no R? We know R must be included, so we must include R.\n\nSince R must be in the word, we need to include it.\n\nSo, words that include R:\n\n- ""ROWDY"": R in position 1, O, W, D, Y\n- ""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L\n- ""TROPH"": not a word? \n- ""POWER"": P, O, W, E – but E is bad? Yes, E is excluded. So cannot use E.\n\n""POWER"" has E, so invalid.\n\n""ROWTH"" – not common.\n\n""WORST"": W, O, R, S, T. This has R in the third position. Also, avoids A, C, N, E. And it\'s a common word.\n\nBut note: W and O and S and T are all new.\n\n""WORST"" seems good: letters W, O, R, S, T.\n\nPositions: \n1: W\n2: O\n3: R\n4: S\n5: T\n\nSince R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we are putting it in position 3, that might be good to test if R is at position 3.\n\nAlso, this covers four new consonants and one vowel (O).\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that places R in position 1? Like ""ROBOT"" – but B and T? But we might want to avoid repeating O twice? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has O twice? O at position 2 and 4? But also, we have two O\'s? The word ""ROBOT"" has O twice? Actually, no: ROBOT is R-O-B-O-T, so two O\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. The secret word might have duplicates? The rules don\'t specify, but typically Wordle allows duplicate letters? Actually, in Wordle the secret word might have duplicate letters.\n\nBut since we don\'t know, it\'s okay? But also, we haven\'t tested for duplicates? However, in this case, using ""ROBOT"" would mean: R, O, B, O, T. But we are using O twice? That might not be efficient because we are testing the same letter twice? Also, B is an uncommon letter?\n\nPerhaps a word with unique letters is better for getting more information.\n\nSo, ""WORST"" has unique letters: W, O, R, S, T.\n\nThat\'s probably better.\n\nAnother word: ""SPORT"" – S, P, O, R, T. Also unique letters? S, P, O, R, T – yes. But R is in the fourth position? Position: S (1), P (2), O (3), R (4), T (5). So R in position 4.\n\nCompare ""WORST"" and ""SPORT"": both are good. But ""WORST"" includes W, while ""SPORT"" includes P. W is less common than P? Actually, P is more common.\n\nBut we want to test frequent letters? In English, S and T are very common.\n\nGiven that, perhaps ""SPORT"" is good? Or ""TROIS"" – that might not be English? Better stick with common words.\n\nI think ""WORST"" is fine.\n\nAnother common one: ""STORM"" – S, T, O, R, M. But again, R in position 4? Wait: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), M(5). So R in position 4.\n\nBut ""WORST"" has R in position 3.\n\nGiven that we know R must be in a position other than 2, let\'s choose a position arbitrarily? Since position 1,3,4,5 are possibilities, we could pick one to test a specific position? But I don\'t think that\'s necessary? Covering more letters is more important.\n\nI will go with ""WORST"" because it covers the common letters W, O, R, S, T? Wait, W is not that common. Another alternative: ""STROLL"" – too long.\n\nAnother: ""TULIP"" – no R? Must include R.\n\nSo, I think ""WORST"" is acceptable.\n\nAlternative: ""PRISM"" – P, R, I, S, M. That is also good: P, R, I, S, M. And R in position 2? Position: P(1), R(2) – but wait: in the previous guess, R was in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. So we know R is not in position 2. Therefore, if we put R in position 2 again, it would again be wrong? Feedback would tell us that it is in the word but wrong position again? Which doesn\'t give new information about R\'s position? Actually, no: we know it\'s not in position 2, so we don\'t need to test position 2 again.\n\nIn the feedback, we learned that R is in the word but not in the second position. So we should avoid placing R in position 2.\n\n""PRISM"" has R in position 2: \nPosition 1: P\nPosition 2: R -> but this position was already tested (second position) and found to be incorrect? So it would be inefficient.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid placing R in position 2.\n\nThus, ""WORST"" is okay: R is in position 3.\n\n""SPORT"" is okay: R in position 4.\n\nI also thought of ""DIRTY"": D, I, R, T, Y. R is in position 3? Position: D, I, R, T, Y – yes, position 3.\n\nAnother: ""GIRLY"" – G, I, R, L, Y – R in position 3.\n\nBut I think words like ""WORST"", ""SPORT"", ""DIRTY"" are fine.\n\nLet me choose ""WORST"". I think it\'s a valid word.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""worst"".\n\nThus, second guess is ""worst"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: We must include R because we know it\'s in the word, and we do: at position 3? Wait: WORST is:\n\nW O R S T\n\nPosition:\n1: W\n2: O\n3: R\n4: S\n5: T\n\nR is at 3rd position? Yes.\n\nAnd it avoids C, A, N, E.\n\nSo, we hope to get feedback on W, O, R, S, T.\n\nAfter this, we can narrow down.\n\nWait: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have information either way? So it\'s okay.\n\nSo, my guess: ""worst""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (marked as X).\n- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked as -).\n\nTherefore, the new guess must:\n- Include R (since it is confirmed in the word), but avoid placing it in the second position.\n- Exclude the letters C, A, N, E.\n- Introduce new letters to maximize information gain.\n\nA strong choice is ""WORST"" because:\n- It includes R in the third position (avoiding position 2).\n- It avoids C, A, N, E.\n- It tests four new common letters: W, O, S, T, maximizing potential feedback.\n\nNow, submit this guess.\n\n<guess>worst</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: worst -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(x) R(✓) S(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position.\n- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""worst""\n- W: x (not in the word)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct letter in the correct position, so R is the third letter of the secret word)\n- S: - (in the word, but wrong position)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- R is confirmed to be the third letter (position 3) of the secret word.\n- S is in the word, but not in the fourth position (where it was in ""worst"").\n- W, O, T are not in the word.\n\nSo, combining all information:\n\nLetters not in the word: C, A, N, E, W, O, T\nLetters in the word: R (at position 3) and S (somewhere, but not position 4)\n\nWe also know that R is fixed at position 3.\n\nNow, the secret word has the form: _ _ R _ _\n\nWe need to find a word that:\n- Has R in the third position.\n- Contains S, but not in the fourth position.\n- Does not contain C, A, N, E, W, O, T.\n\nWe have to choose a new guess that tests possible letters for the remaining positions.\n\nRemaining positions: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\nWe know S is in the word but not in position 4, so S must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 5.\n\nWe should also consider other common letters that haven\'t been tested yet.\n\nList of untested letters (excluding the known bad ones and the known good ones):\n\nAlphabet minus known bad: C, A, N, E, W, O, T\nMinus known good: R, S\n\nSo, available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z\n\nBut we need to form a valid 5-letter word.\n\nWe also know S must be placed in one of positions 1, 2, or 5 (since not 4, and not 3 because R is there).\n\nWe should try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nPossible strategies:\n\n1.

We can also try to test other common letters to see if they are in the word.\n\nGiven that we have only 4 guesses left, we need to be efficient.\n\nLet me think of words that have R in the third position and S in position 1, 2, or 5, and use other untested letters.\n\nFor example:\n- If S is in position 1: words like S_ R _ _\n- If S is in position 2: words like _ S R _ _\n- If S is in position 5: words like _ _ R _ S\n\nWe also need to avoid the bad letters.\n\nLet\'s list possible words for each case:\n\nCase 1: S at position 1\n- The word would be S _ R _ _\n- Avoid C,A,N,E,W,O,T\n- Possible words: \n  - ""SPRIG"" (but G is untested, and I is untested) - valid word? SPRIG is a word.\n  - ""SPRUE"" (but E is bad) - invalid.\n  - ""SPRUG"" - not a word.\n  - ""SHRIK"" - not common? Shrik is not a word, but ""shrink"" is 6 letters.\n  - ""SHRUB"" - S H R U B -> positions: S(1), H(2), R(3), U(4), B(5). Avoids bad letters? H, U, B are untested. But ""shrub"" is a word.\n\nCase 2: S at position 2\n- _ S R _ _\n- Words: \n  - ""USHER"" - but U, S, H, E, R -> E is bad, so invalid.\n  - ""ASHER"" - A is bad.\n  - ""ISLET"" - but T is bad and position: I S L E T -> E and T bad, and R not at 3? Not matching pattern.\n  - We need R at 3, so second letter S and third R: so pattern _ S R _ _\n  - ""USURP"" - U S U R P -> but U repeated? And positions: U(1), S(2), U(3) but we need R at 3, so not.\n  - ""MUSHY"" - M U S H Y -> S at 3? No, S is at 3? M(1), U(2), S(3), H(4), Y(5) -> but we need R at 3, not S. So invalid.\n  - Actually, we need the third letter to be R, so the word must be _ S R _ _\n  - Examples: ""ASPRO"" - A bad. ""BESET"" - E bad. ""DISCO"" - D I S C O -> C and O bad. \n  - ""GYROS"" - G Y R O S -> O is bad. \n  - ""LYRES"" - L Y R E S -> E bad.\n  - It\'s hard to find words with _ S R _ _ that avoid bad letters.\n\nCase 3: S at position 5\n- _ _ R _ S\n- Words:\n  - ""BARNS"" - A and N bad.\n  - ""FIRMS"" - F I R M S -> avoids bad letters? F, I, M are untested. ""firms"" is a word.\n  - ""GIRDS"" - G I R D S -> avoids bad letters. ""girds"" is a word.\n  - ""HURDS"" - H U R D S -> ""hurds"" is not common, but ""hurls"" has L? ""hurls"" is H U R L S -> avoids bad letters? H, U, L untested. ""hurls"" is a word.\n  - ""PURIS"" - P U R I S -> ""puris"" is a word? It might be, but less common.\n\nGiven the difficulty with position 2, and since we have to test S, perhaps we should try to place S in position 1 or 5 to get feedback on its position.\n\nAlso, we can choose a word that has S in a new position and tests other common letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we know R is fixed at 3, and S is somewhere else, we can try a word that has S in position 1 and then test other vowels or common consonants.\n\nFor example, ""SHRUB"" as I thought earlier: S H R U B\n\nBut let\'s check the feedback we would get: \n- If we guess ""SHRUB"":\n  - S: if it\'s in the word and correct position? We don\'t know if S is at position 1.\n  - H: new letter\n  - R: already correct, so ✓\n  - U: new letter\n  - B: new letter\n\nBut we are not sure about S at position 1.\n\nAlternatively, we could try ""SPRIG"": S P R I G\n\nBut P, I, G are new.\n\nHowever, we have to avoid using too many letters that might not be in the word.\n\nAnother common word: ""SHIRE"" - but E is bad, so no.\n\n""SHIRK"": S H I R K -> positions: S(1), H(2), I(3) but R is at 3? No, I is at 3, R at 4? So not, because R must be at 3.\n\nWe need R at position 3.\n\nSo, ""SHRUG"": S H R U G -> this is good: S(1), H(2), R(3), U(4), G(5). Avoids bad letters.\n\n""SHRUG"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHRUB"" is also valid.\n\nBut ""SHRUG"" has U and G.\n\nWe could also consider ""SPRIG"": S P R I G -> S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). Also valid.\n\nNow, which one to choose? Both are good.\n\nBut we also have to consider that S might not be at position 1. If we put S at position 1 and it\'s not, then we get feedback that S is not at 1, so it must be at 2 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, if we put S at position 5, we can test that.\n\nBut since position 2 is difficult, maybe test position 1 first.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have S in position 4 (which we already know is wrong) and not in position 3 (taken by R), so positions 1,2,5 are possible.\n\nBut in our guess, we can place S in one of these to test.\n\nI think ""SHRUG"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that tests more vowels. We have only tested O (which is bad) and A and E (bad), so vowels left are I, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nSo, including I or U might be good.\n\n""SPRIG"" has I, which is a vowel.\n\n""SHRUG"" has U.\n\nBoth are fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SHRUG"" for now.\n\nBut we also have the option to not fix S at position 1 and instead put it in position 5? For example, ""PURIS"" or ""FIRMS"", but let\'s see.\n\nAnother idea: since we know S is in the word, and we have to find its position, we can choose a word that has S in a position we haven\'t tested, and also tests other common letters.\n\nBut we have positions 1,2,5 to test for S.\n\nPosition 2 might be rare? So testing position 1 or 5 might be better.\n\nI think ""SHRUG"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo, I\'ll guess ""SHRUG"".\n\nBut let\'s double-check the bad letters: C, A, N, E, W, O, T. ""SHRUG"" has S, H, R, U, G. None of these are bad, so it\'s okay.\n\nR is at position 3, which is correct.\n\nS is at position 1, which we are testing.\n\nSo, feedback will tell us if S is at position 1 or not, and also about H, U, G.\n\nIf S is at position 1, we get a ✓, else if it\'s in the word but wrong position, we get a -, but since we know S is in the word, if it\'s not at 1, it must be at 2 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, for other letters.\n\nSo, I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, third guess: ""SHRUG""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)  \n  - This indicates that R is in the secret word but not in position 2.

W, O, and T are not in the word.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Secret word structure**: The word has R in position 3: `_ _ R _ _`.\n- **Confirmed letters**: \n  - R (position 3) and S (somewhere, but not position 4).\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E, W, O, T (not in the word).\n- **Remaining positions to solve**: 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n- **S must be in position 1, 2, or 5** (since it\'s not in 3 or 4).\n- **Untested letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (we need to test these to gather more information).\n\n### Strategy for the Next Guess:\n- **Include S** in a new position (1, 2, or 5) to narrow down its location.\n- **Avoid eliminated letters** (C, A, N, E, W, O, T).\n- **Test new common letters** (e.g., H, U, G, I, L, D) to maximize feedback.\n- **Prioritize words with high-frequency consonants and vowels** (e.g., S, H, L, D, U, I) to increase the chance of hits.\n\nA strong choice is **""SHRUG""**:\n- **Structure**: S H R U G\n  - S in position 1 (tests if S is in the correct starting position).\n  - H in position 2 (new letter test).\n  - R in position 3 (confirmed correct, so it will be marked ✓).\n  - U in position 4 (new vowel test, as we haven\'t checked U yet).\n  - G in position 5 (new consonant test).\n- **Why this word?**\n  - It tests S in position 1, which is one of the possible locations for S (if S is not here, it must be in position 2 or 5).\n  - It introduces three new common letters (H, U, G), which are untested and could appear in the secret word.\n  - It avoids all eliminated letters and uses distinct characters for efficient feedback.\n  - If S is not in position 1, the feedback will still help locate S (e.g., if S is marked ""-"", it must be in position 2 or 5).\n\n<guess>shrug</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: worst -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(x) R(✓) S(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: shrug -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) R(✓) U(-) G(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
- Meaning: R is in the word but not in position 2; C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""worst"" -> W(x), O(x), R(✓), S(-), T(x)
- Meaning: R is correct and in position 3; S is in the word but not in position 4; W, O, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""shrug"" -> S(✓), H(x), R(✓), U(-), G(x)
- Meaning: S is correct and in position 1; R is correct in position 3; U is in the word but not in position 4; H and G are not in the word.

Now, compiling all information:

1. Known correct positions:
   - Position 1: S (from guess 3: S(✓))
   - Position 3: R (from guess 2: R(✓))

   So the secret word is: S _ R _ _

2. Known letters in the word but wrong positions:
   - U is in the word (from guess 3: U(-)), but not in position 4 (since in ""shrug"" it was at position 4).
     Therefore, U must be in position 2 or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are taken by S and R).

3. Eliminated letters:
   From all feedback: C, A, N, E, W, O, T, H, G are not in the word.
   Specifically: 
     Guess 1: C, A, N, E
     Guess 2: W, O, T
     Guess 3: H, G

4. Therefore, the secret word is: S _ R _ _
   - The blanks must be filled with letters from the remaining set, excluding the eliminated ones.
   - Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, Y, Z (and U is confirmed to be in the word)

But note: U is confirmed to be in the word, so one of the positions (2 or 5) must be U.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Possible cases for U:
- Position 2: Then the word is S U R _ _
- Position 5: Then the word is S _ R _ U

Now, we need to choose a guess that helps us determine where U is and what the other letters are.

Possible words:

Case 1: U in position 2 (S U R _ _)
  - The last two letters can be any of the remaining letters, excluding eliminated ones.
  - Examples: SURGE (but G is eliminated), SURFY (F and Y are possible), SURFS (S is duplicate? But S is already at position 1, and feedback hasn't indicated duplicates, so it might be possible? However, we must consider if S can appear twice? But in ""worst"" S was at position 4 and marked wrong, but now we know S is at 1. So if S appears again, it would be another instance. But let's check feedback: in ""worst"", S was marked '-' meaning it's in the word but wrong position. Now we know S is at position 1, so there might be only one S? Not necessarily, but we need to be cautious.

However, we have not seen any evidence of duplicate S. Moreover, in ""worst"" S was in position 4 and marked wrong, and now we have S at 1 correct. So if there were another S, it might have been marked in ""worst"", but we don't know? Actually, the feedback for S in ""worst"" was '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 4. That could be because if S appears once at position 1 (which we now know), then the '-' in guess2 for S might be because of the S at position 1? But in guess2 ""worst"", position 1 was W (wrong, not S). So if there was an S at position 1, and we guessed S at position 4, it would still be marked '-' because the letter is in the word but wrong position. But now we have confirmed S at position 1, so in ""worst"" the S at position 4 was a duplicate? Or it could be a different occurrence? Actually, we don't have information about duplicates, so we must allow for the possibility. But to keep it simple, maybe assume no duplicates for now? Or test.

Case 2: U in position 5 (S _ R _ U)

Given that U is the only additional confirmed letter, and it must be in either position 2 or 5.

We also have to consider the remaining positions. For position 4, we know from guess2 that S is not there, and from guess3 that U is not there. Also, eliminated letters are not there.

New guess should test both possibilities.

We can choose a word that uses U in one of the positions and tests common letters for the others.

But we have limited letters: available: B,D,F,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,Y,Z

And U is used in either position 2 or 5.

For example, if we think U is in position 5, we might guess a word like S _ R _ U, with a letter from the pool for positions 2 and 4.

Similarly, if U is in position 2, we guess S U R _ _.

A good guess might be a word that tests U in a specific position and also tests other common letters.

But we need to decide: let's test if U is in position 2 by guessing a word that has U in position 2? For example, ""SURFY"" (if valid), but let's choose.

Common words: 

- For pattern S U R _ _ : ""SURLY"" (but L and Y are available) -> S U R L Y
  - This uses L and Y, both untested.

- For pattern S _ R _ U: ""SYRUP"" (but Y and P) -> S Y R U P -> but U is at position 4? And we need U at position 5? Actually, we are testing U at position 5, but in ""SYRUP"", U is at position 4? Pattern S _ R _ U: so position 2: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: U. In ""SYRUP"" it's S(1) Y(2) R(3) U(4) P(5), so U is at 4, not 5.

I mean, we want U at the end for position 5: so words ending with U? Like ""STRIPU""? Not common.

There are not many English words ending with U. Examples: ""BAYOU"" - not matching pattern, ""ADIEU"" - not matching, ""BATTU"" - rare? But we have pattern S _ R _ U.

Actually, common words: ""SIRUP"" is the same as syrup? But U would be at position 4? Not position 5.

I think SIRUP is not good because U is at 4.

Another possibility: ""SIFRS""? Not a word.

Perhaps U is more likely in position 2? And we should guess ""SURLY"".

But in ""SURLY"": S U R L Y

Now, feedback on this guess:
- S: already correct, so will be ✓
- U: we are guessing at position 2? If U is indeed in position 2, then ✓; else if U is in position 5, it would be '-' (since U is in the word but not at position 2, because U is already known to be in the word and positions 1,3,4 are taken? Positions: 1(S),2(? not U),3(R),4(? not U if we put L), then U at 5 would be not tested? Actually, if we don't put U in the word, we won't get feedback for U? But we already know U is in the word.

So if we guess ""SURLY"", if U is at position 2, we get:
  - S(✓), U(✓), R(✓), L(? not known), Y(? not known)
If U is not at position 2, but in position 5, then we get:
  - S(✓), U(-) if we put U at 2 but it isn't, but since we put U at 2 and it's actually at 5, we would get U marked as '-' meaning it's in the word but wrong position? This would tell us that U is not at position 2, so it must be at position 5.

Also, we get feedback for L and Y.

So ""SURLY"" is a good test: it tells us about U's position and tests L and Y.

We could also test a word with U at position 5? But it's harder because of few common words? As said.

Another option: ""SUMAC"" - but A is eliminated? Since A is bad.

Avoid eliminated letters.

So ""SURLY"" is a valid word and avoids bad letters.

Similarly, we could do ""SURFY"" but ""surfy"" is not common; ""surf"" is 4 letters? Not good.

""SURLY"" seems good.

But we also know that position 4 is open, and we haven't guessed many letters for that.

Another possibility: we know U is in the word, and it's not at position 4, so if we put U at position 5, we might get more information about the other positions.

For example, guess a word with pattern S _ R _ U? Let's find such a word.

Possible: ""SIRRU""? not English.

""STARU""? T is eliminated.

""SCARU""? C and A eliminated.

Words ending with U: like ""SUCCU""? Not valid, and C eliminated.

""BAYOU"", ""BANTU"", ""MANGOU""? None fitting the pattern.

Therefore, it's more likely that U is in position 2? Because position 5 ending with U is rare.

So, I think ""SURLY"" is a reasonable guess.

Thus, I'll go with ""SURLY"".

But let me confirm: S U R L Y

Positions: 1=S, 2=U, 3=R, 4=L, 5=Y

If the secret word has U in position 2, then U will be correct. Else, if U is in position 5, then we get U marked as '-' meaning it's present but not at position 2 (so at position 5). And we test L and Y.

Also, the word uses untested letters L and Y.

So, forth guess: ""SURLY""
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

After reviewing the feedback from all three guesses:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
   - R is in the secret word but not in position 2.  
   - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

2. **Guess 2: ""worst"" → Feedback: W(x) O(x) R(✓) S(-) T(x)**  
   - R is confirmed in position 3.  
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - W, O, T are not in the word.  

3. **Guess 3: ""shrug"" → Feedback: S(✓) H(x) R(✓) U(-) G(x)**  
   - S is confirmed in position 1.  
   - R is confirmed in position 3 (redundant but consistent).  
   - U is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - H and G are not in the word.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word pattern**: `S _ R _ _` (positions 1 and 3 are fixed as S and R).  
- **Confirmed letters**:  
  - S (position 1)  
  - R (position 3)  
  - U (in the word, but not in position 4; must be in position 2 or 5).  
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E, W, O, T, H, G (not in the word).  
- **Untested letters**: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z.  
- **Positions left**: 2, 4, 5 (position 4 cannot be S or U based on prior feedback).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Focus on U**: Since U must be in position 2 or 5, prioritize a word that tests U in one of these positions to narrow down options.  
- **Test new letters**: Avoid eliminated letters and introduce high-frequency consonants/vowels like L, Y, D, or F to gather more clues.  
- **Word choice**:  
  - A strong candidate is **""SURLY""** (S U R L Y). It:  
    - Tests U in position 2 (if U is correct here, it solves position 2; if marked ""-"", U must be in position 5).  
    - Introduces L (position 4) and Y (position 5), both common untested letters.  
    - Avoids all eliminated letters (C, A, N, E, W, O, T, H, G).  
    - Aligns with the pattern `S _ R _ _`, maximizing feedback efficiency.  

If ""SURLY"" is incorrect, feedback (especially on U, L, and Y) will reveal U’s true position and constrain the secret word further.

<guess>surly</guess>",surly,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
- Meaning: R is in the word but not in position 2; C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""worst"" -> W(x), O(x), R(✓), S(-), T(x)
- Meaning: R is correct and in position 3; S is in the word but not in position 4; W, O, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""shrug"" -> S(✓), H(x), R(✓), U(-), G(x)
- Meaning: S is correct and in position 1; R is correct in position 3; U is in the word but not in position 4; H and G are not in the word.

Now, compiling all information:

1. Known correct positions:
   - Position 1: S (from guess 3: S(✓))
   - Position 3: R (from guess 2: R(✓))

   So the secret word is: S _ R _ _

2. Known letters in the word but wrong positions:
   - U is in the word (from guess 3: U(-)), but not in position 4 (since in ""shrug"" it was at position 4).
     Therefore, U must be in position 2 or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are taken by S and R).

3. Eliminated letters:
   From all feedback: C, A, N, E, W, O, T, H, G are not in the word.
   Specifically: 
     Guess 1: C, A, N, E
     Guess 2: W, O, T
     Guess 3: H, G

4. Therefore, the secret word is: S _ R _ _
   - The blanks must be filled with letters from the remaining set, excluding the eliminated ones.
   - Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, Y, Z (and U is confirmed to be in the word)

But note: U is confirmed to be in the word, so one of the positions (2 or 5) must be U.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Possible cases for U:
- Position 2: Then the word is S U R _ _
- Position 5: Then the word is S _ R _ U

Now, we need to choose a guess that helps us determine where U is and what the other letters are.

Possible words:

Case 1: U in position 2 (S U R _ _)
  - The last two letters can be any of the remaining letters, excluding eliminated ones.
  - Examples: SURGE (but G is eliminated), SURFY (F and Y are possible), SURFS (S is duplicate? But S is already at position 1, and feedback hasn't indicated duplicates, so it might be possible? However, we must consider if S can appear twice? But in ""worst"" S was at position 4 and marked wrong, but now we know S is at 1. So if S appears again, it would be another instance. But let's check feedback: in ""worst"", S was marked '-' meaning it's in the word but wrong position. Now we know S is at position 1, so there might be only one S? Not necessarily, but we need to be cautious.

However, we have not seen any evidence of duplicate S. Moreover, in ""worst"" S was in position 4 and marked wrong, and now we have S at 1 correct. So if there were another S, it might have been marked in ""worst"", but we don't know? Actually, the feedback for S in ""worst"" was '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 4. That could be because if S appears once at position 1 (which we now know), then the '-' in guess2 for S might be because of the S at position 1? But in guess2 ""worst"", position 1 was W (wrong, not S). So if there was an S at position 1, and we guessed S at position 4, it would still be marked '-' because the letter is in the word but wrong position. But now we have confirmed S at position 1, so in ""worst"" the S at position 4 was a duplicate? Or it could be a different occurrence? Actually, we don't have information about duplicates, so we must allow for the possibility. But to keep it simple, maybe assume no duplicates for now? Or test.

Case 2: U in position 5 (S _ R _ U)

Given that U is the only additional confirmed letter, and it must be in either position 2 or 5.

We also have to consider the remaining positions. For position 4, we know from guess2 that S is not there, and from guess3 that U is not there. Also, eliminated letters are not there.

New guess should test both possibilities.

We can choose a word that uses U in one of the positions and tests common letters for the others.

But we have limited letters: available: B,D,F,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,Y,Z

And U is used in either position 2 or 5.

For example, if we think U is in position 5, we might guess a word like S _ R _ U, with a letter from the pool for positions 2 and 4.

Similarly, if U is in position 2, we guess S U R _ _.

A good guess might be a word that tests U in a specific position and also tests other common letters.

But we need to decide: let's test if U is in position 2 by guessing a word that has U in position 2? For example, ""SURFY"" (if valid), but let's choose.

Common words: 

- For pattern S U R _ _ : ""SURLY"" (but L and Y are available) -> S U R L Y
  - This uses L and Y, both untested.

- For pattern S _ R _ U: ""SYRUP"" (but Y and P) -> S Y R U P -> but U is at position 4? And we need U at position 5? Actually, we are testing U at position 5, but in ""SYRUP"", U is at position 4? Pattern S _ R _ U: so position 2: ?, position 4: ?, position 5: U. In ""SYRUP"" it's S(1) Y(2) R(3) U(4) P(5), so U is at 4, not 5.

I mean, we want U at the end for position 5: so words ending with U? Like ""STRIPU""? Not common.

There are not many English words ending with U. Examples: ""BAYOU"" - not matching pattern, ""ADIEU"" - not matching, ""BATTU"" - rare? But we have pattern S _ R _ U.

Actually, common words: ""SIRUP"" is the same as syrup? But U would be at position 4? Not position 5.

I think SIRUP is not good because U is at 4.

Another possibility: ""SIFRS""? Not a word.

Perhaps U is more likely in position 2? And we should guess ""SURLY"".

But in ""SURLY"": S U R L Y

Now, feedback on this guess:
- S: already correct, so will be ✓
- U: we are guessing at position 2? If U is indeed in position 2, then ✓; else if U is in position 5, it would be '-' (since U is in the word but not at position 2, because U is already known to be in the word and positions 1,3,4 are taken? Positions: 1(S),2(? not U),3(R),4(? not U if we put L), then U at 5 would be not tested? Actually, if we don't put U in the word, we won't get feedback for U? But we already know U is in the word.

So if we guess ""SURLY"", if U is at position 2, we get:
  - S(✓), U(✓), R(✓), L(? not known), Y(? not known)
If U is not at position 2, but in position 5, then we get:
  - S(✓), U(-) if we put U at 2 but it isn't, but since we put U at 2 and it's actually at 5, we would get U marked as '-' meaning it's in the word but wrong position? This would tell us that U is not at position 2, so it must be at position 5.

Also, we get feedback for L and Y.

So ""SURLY"" is a good test: it tells us about U's position and tests L and Y.

We could also test a word with U at position 5? But it's harder because of few common words? As said.

Another option: ""SUMAC"" - but A is eliminated? Since A is bad.

Avoid eliminated letters.

So ""SURLY"" is a valid word and avoids bad letters.

Similarly, we could do ""SURFY"" but ""surfy"" is not common; ""surf"" is 4 letters? Not good.

""SURLY"" seems good.

But we also know that position 4 is open, and we haven't guessed many letters for that.

Another possibility: we know U is in the word, and it's not at position 4, so if we put U at position 5, we might get more information about the other positions.

For example, guess a word with pattern S _ R _ U? Let's find such a word.

Possible: ""SIRRU""? not English.

""STARU""? T is eliminated.

""SCARU""? C and A eliminated.

Words ending with U: like ""SUCCU""? Not valid, and C eliminated.

""BAYOU"", ""BANTU"", ""MANGOU""? None fitting the pattern.

Therefore, it's more likely that U is in position 2? Because position 5 ending with U is rare.

So, I think ""SURLY"" is a reasonable guess.

Thus, I'll go with ""SURLY"".

But let me confirm: S U R L Y

Positions: 1=S, 2=U, 3=R, 4=L, 5=Y

If the secret word has U in position 2, then U will be correct. Else, if U is in position 5, then we get U marked as '-' meaning it's present but not at position 2 (so at position 5). And we test L and Y.

Also, the word uses untested letters L and Y.

So, forth guess: ""SURLY""### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

After reviewing the feedback from all three guesses:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
   - R is in the secret word but not in position 2.  
   - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

2. **Guess 2: ""worst"" → Feedback: W(x) O(x) R(✓) S(-) T(x)**  
   - R is confirmed in position 3.  
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - W, O, T are not in the word.  

3. **Guess 3: ""shrug"" → Feedback: S(✓) H(x) R(✓) U(-) G(x)**  
   - S is confirmed in position 1.  
   - R is confirmed in position 3 (redundant but consistent).  
   - U is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - H and G are not in the word.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word pattern**: `S _ R _ _` (positions 1 and 3 are fixed as S and R).  
- **Confirmed letters**:  
  - S (position 1)  
  - R (position 3)  
  - U (in the word, but not in position 4; must be in position 2 or 5).  
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, E, W, O, T, H, G (not in the word).  
- **Untested letters**: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, Y, Z.  
- **Positions left**: 2, 4, 5 (position 4 cannot be S or U based on prior feedback).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Focus on U**: Since U must be in position 2 or 5, prioritize a word that tests U in one of these positions to narrow down options.  
- **Test new letters**: Avoid eliminated letters and introduce high-frequency consonants/vowels like L, Y, D, or F to gather more clues.  
- **Word choice**:  
  - A strong candidate is **""SURLY""** (S U R L Y). It:  
    - Tests U in position 2 (if U is correct here, it solves position 2; if marked ""-"", U must be in position 5).  
    - Introduces L (position 4) and Y (position 5), both common untested letters.  
    - Avoids all eliminated letters (C, A, N, E, W, O, T, H, G).  
    - Aligns with the pattern `S _ R _ _`, maximizing feedback efficiency.  

If ""SURLY"" is incorrect, feedback (especially on U, L, and Y) will reveal U’s true position and constrain the secret word further.",Guess 4: surly -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(✓) R(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
