We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all fairly common in English words.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"":
 Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R, A, N, E are all not in the word at all (marked with x).

 Important note: Since only C is correct and in position 1, and the other letters are absent, we know:
 - The first letter is C.
 - The word does not contain R, A, N, or E.

 We need to make a second guess. The word starts with C, and does not contain R, A, N, E.

 Let's think about possible words that start with C and avoid the letters R,A,N,E.

 Since we have only one correct letter so far, we want to use this guess to get more information about the other letters.

 We should choose a word that:
 1. Starts with C (since position 1 is fixed as C).
 2. Uses new letters that we haven't tried yet to maximize information.

 Avoid using any of the disallowed letters: R, A, N, E.

 Available letters: We can use letters from the rest of the alphabet excluding R,A,N,E.

 We also want to cover common letters. Common consonants might be T, L, S, etc., and vowels might be I, O, U (since E,A are out).

 Let me try to think of a word that starts with C and has other common letters.

 Some possibilities: 
 - Could try words like ""C"" + a combination of T, L, S, H, O, I, U, etc.

 Examples: 
   ""CHILL"", but we have 5 letters and ""CHILL"" is 5 letters? Let's check: C-H-I-L-L -> but it has L repeated? Actually, ""CHILL"" is C-H-I-L-L, so yes. However, repeated L might not be ideal for information.
   ""CLIMB"" -> C, L, I, M, B -> only unique letters? Yes.

 Let me list some words:
   ""COULD"" -> contains O, U, L, D -> but O and U are vowels? Actually, we don't know about vowels yet except that A and E are not present.
   ""C"" followed by other popular letters: T, L, S, H, O, I, U, etc.

 We have already eliminated 4 letters: R, A, N, E. So we have 22 letters left.

 Since we need to maximize information, we should try to include letters that are frequent in 5-letter words.

 According to English letter frequency, after the top letters we've excluded, we have: 
   E (excluded), A (excluded), then common ones: T, O, I, S, H, etc.

 But without E and A, we have T, O, I, S, H, R (but R is excluded) -> R is excluded? Yes, in our feedback R was x, meaning absent.

 So possible words: 
   ""COST"" is only 4 letters, so no.
   ""CLOUD"" -> C L O U D -> contains O and U (vowels) and L, D. This might be good because it introduces new vowels and consonants.

   ""CHIST""? That's not a word. 
   ""CHISL""? Not a word.

   ""COULY""? Not a common word.

   ""COILS"" -> C, O, I, L, S: all unique and new? But we don't know about S. Also, we haven't tried S, O, I, L.

   ""CIVIL"" -> C, I, V, I, L -> but repeated I? Actually, 'I' appears twice? Spelling ""civil"" has two I's? Position 2 and 4? Actually, word: C-I-V-I-L -> that's one I? Wait: C-I-V-I-L? No, it's C-I-V-I-L? Actually, it has two I's. Positions: 2 and 4. So repeated letter? Not ideal.

   ""CHOMP"" -> C, H, O, M, P. All unique? Yes.

   ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S. This might be good? But note we have S.

   ""CURLY"" -> but contains R -> disallowed? We cannot use R.

   Let me think: avoid R,A,N,E.

   Some candidates:
   - ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D.
   - ""CHOPD""? Not a word.
   - ""CHOPS"": C, H, O, P, S -> valid word? Yes.

   ""CHOPS"": meaning to cut. So ""CHOPS"" is acceptable.

   Another: ""CLOMP""? Not common, but valid? However, not as common as ""CHOPS"".

   ""COVER"": but contains E -> E is disallowed.

   ""QUA?"" -> not starting with C.

   ""C"" and then try to get information about vowels? We know the word doesn't have A or E, so vowels must be O, I, U? Or none? But most English words have vowels.

   Alternatively, ""SPLIT"" -> doesn't start with C.

   We need words starting with C.

   Let me think of common words: 
      ""COULD"" -> uses O, U, L, D -> but U and O?
      ""COAST"" -> but has A -> disallowed? A is excluded.

   ""COAST"" contains A -> so we cannot use A. Hence invalid.

   ""CHART"" -> contains A -> disallowed.

   ""CUT"" -> too short.

   ""CUBIC""? That has two C's? But we already know the first letter is C. The word might have another C? Our feedback for first guess didn't say anything about duplicate C? But we didn't have a duplicate. Now, it's possible? Yes.

   However, to maximize new letters, we might avoid repeating C? But since we only have one C so far? But we don't know if there are duplicates.

   Let me choose a word that avoids duplication and avoids the disallowed letters.

   Words: 
      ""COMBS"" -> C, O, M, B, S -> unique letters? Yes? But ""COMBS"" is a word? Yes (noun meaning the bees' home or verb meaning to groom hair?).

   ""COMET"" -> but E is disallowed.

   ""COMIC"" -> but repeated C? We know position 1 is C, so we would put C at position 1 again? Then the word starts with C. The other C? At position 4? We don't know if that would be correct. But also it has I.

   Let me consider: 
   Criteria: We want to test vowels? Since we've eliminated E and A, we could try O and I? Or U?

   ""COINS"" -> O and I? But contains I, O, N? Wait: does ""COINS"" contain N? COINS: C, O, I, N, S -> but N is disallowed? We know N is not in the word.

   Therefore, we must avoid N.

   So ""COINS"" is invalid because of N.

   ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S -> all new? And no A, E, N, R? Yes.

   Let's try ""CHOPS"": 
      If the word is ""CHOPS"" itself? Then we win? But we don't know yet.

   If not, we can get feedback on H, O, P, S.

   Alternatively, ""CLOUD"" -> C, L, O, U, D -> also good? But U is less common.

   Let me prioritize letters that are more common. Without E, A, R, N, what are the next common? 
   After E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S -> but R, A, N are out -> then common: I, O, T, S.

   So I, O, T, S are good.

   Now, we have positions 2-5: unknown.

   We are trying: 
      Option 1: ""CHOPS"": uses H, O, P, S -> note: H is not among the top? Well, H is common. 
      Option 2: ""COSTS"" -> but repeated S? Not ideal.

   ""COILS"": C, O, I, L, S -> avoids E, A, R, N? Yes. And uses O, I, L, S? L is common.

   So ""COILS"" is a word? Yes, meaning wires wound in a spiral.

   Let me compare ""CHOPS"" and ""COILS"". Both are valid.

   Which one covers more frequent letters?

   Among O, I: O and I are vowel-like. Then L vs H? L is more common than H? 
   Letter frequency: 
        O: 4th? (without E,A,R) -> actually in English, E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S are top. We have R,A,N,E out? So top remaining: I, O, T, S.

   ""CHOPS"": H, O, P, S -> O and S are very common. P is somewhat common? 
   ""COILS"": O, I, L, S -> I, O, S are common? L is also common? Actually L is 12th overall? 

   Both include O and S.

   Now, we want to avoid the possibility that we run into duplicates? 

   Since we don't know if the word has duplicates? We are free to use duplicates? However, for maximum information, unique letters are better.

   Both are unique? 
      ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S: unique? C is at start? We are introducing H,O,P,S -> all distinct? Yes.
      ""COILS"" -> C, O, I, L, S: distinct? Yes.

   ""COILS"" introduces I and L? Which I haven't tried? And O and S. While ""CHOPS"" introduces H and P? 

   But H and P are less common than I and L? Because I is a vowel and more common? 

   According to letter frequency in English:
      I: about 6.9% 
      O: 7.5%
      L: 4%
      S: 6.3%
      H: 6%
      P: 1.9%

   So ""COILS"" has I (6.9%), O (7.5%), L (4%), S (6.3%)? Total? But we don't count the fixed C? Actually, we are only concerned about the new positions? 

   Overall, ""COILS"" provides letters: O (common), I (common), L (medium), S (common). 
   ""CHOPS"" provides: H (about 6%), O (common), P (less common), S (common).

   Therefore, I think ""COILS"" covers more of the common remaining letters? Because H (6%) vs I (almost 7%)? And P is 1.9% vs L at 4%. 

   So ""COILS"" might be slightly better? Especially because L is more common than P.

   Moreover, we are testing two vowels? The word must have vowels? Since we know E and A are out? So O and I are good candidates.

   Therefore, I choose ""COILS"".

   Second guess: ""coils""

   So the guessed word: <guess>coils</guess>
</think>
<reasoning>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The letter ""C"" is correct and in position 1 (marked ✓).
- The letters ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word (marked x).

Key implications:
1. The correct word starts with ""C"".
2. The word contains none of these letters: R, A, N, E.
3. We need to probe remaining letters to identify possibilities.

For the second guess:
- Must start with ""C"" to preserve the known position-1 letter.
- Avoid using R, A, N, E.
- Use common English letters not yet tested to maximize information gain.
- Prioritize unique letters with high frequency (since duplicates reduce information).

Optimal strategy:
- Focus on common remaining consonants (like L, S, T, H) and vowels (O, I, U).
- Avoid reusing eliminated letters.

Selected word: **""COILS""**
- Starts with ""C"" as required.
- Uses new letters: O, I, L, S (all untested and high frequency).
- Avoids disallowed letters (no R, A, N, E).
- Maximizes information potential: Covers two vowels (O, I) and two common consonants (L, S).

   Letter frequency:

   Overall, ""COILS"" provides letters: O (common), I (common), L (medium), S (common). 
   ""CHOPS"" provides: H (about 6%), O (common), P (less common), S (common).

   Therefore, I think ""COILS"" covers more of the common remaining letters? Because H (6%) vs I (almost 7%)? And P is 1.9% vs L at 4%. 

   So ""COILS"" might be slightly better? Especially because L is more common than P.

   Moreover, we are testing two vowels? The word must have vowels? Since we know E and A are out? So O and I are good candidates.

   Therefore, I choose ""COILS"".

   Second guess: ""coils""

   So the guessed word: <guess>coils</guess><reasoning>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The letter ""C"" is correct and in position 1 (marked ✓).
- The letters ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word (marked x).

Key implications:
1. The correct word starts with ""C"".
2. The word contains none of these letters: R, A, N, E.
3. We need to probe remaining letters to identify possibilities.

For the second guess:
- Must start with ""C"" to preserve the known position-1 letter.
- Avoid using R, A, N, E.
- Use common English letters not yet tested to maximize information gain.
- Prioritize unique letters with high frequency (since duplicates reduce information).

Optimal strategy:
- Focus on common remaining consonants (like L, S, T, H) and vowels (O, I, U).
- Avoid reusing eliminated letters.

Selected word: **""COILS""**
- Starts with ""C"" as required.
- Uses new letters: O, I, L, S (all untested and high frequency).
- Avoids disallowed letters (no R, A, N, E).
- Maximizes information potential: Covers two vowels (O, I) and two common consonants (L, S).

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all fairly common in English words.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"":
 Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R, A, N, E are all not in the word at all (marked with x).

 Important note: Since only C is correct and in position 1, and the other letters are absent, we know:
 - The first letter is C.
 - The word does not contain R, A, N, or E.

 We need to make a second guess. The word starts with C, and does not contain R, A, N, E.

 Let's think about possible words that start with C and avoid the letters R,A,N,E.

 Since we have only one correct letter so far, we want to use this guess to get more information about the other letters.

 We should choose a word that:
 1. Starts with C (since position 1 is fixed as C).
 2. Uses new letters that we haven't tried yet to maximize information.

 Avoid using any of the disallowed letters: R, A, N, E.

 Available letters: We can use letters from the rest of the alphabet excluding R,A,N,E.

 We also want to cover common letters. Common consonants might be T, L, S, etc., and vowels might be I, O, U (since E,A are out).

 Let me try to think of a word that starts with C and has other common letters.

 Some possibilities: 
 - Could try words like ""C"" + a combination of T, L, S, H, O, I, U, etc.

 Examples: 
   ""CHILL"", but we have 5 letters and ""CHILL"" is 5 letters? Let's check: C-H-I-L-L -> but it has L repeated? Actually, ""CHILL"" is C-H-I-L-L, so yes. However, repeated L might not be ideal for information.
   ""CLIMB"" -> C, L, I, M, B -> only unique letters? Yes.

 Let me list some words:
   ""COULD"" -> contains O, U, L, D -> but O and U are vowels? Actually, we don't know about vowels yet except that A and E are not present.
   ""C"" followed by other popular letters: T, L, S, H, O, I, U, etc.

 We have already eliminated 4 letters: R, A, N, E. So we have 22 letters left.

 Since we need to maximize information, we should try to include letters that are frequent in 5-letter words.

 According to English letter frequency, after the top letters we've excluded, we have: 
   E (excluded), A (excluded), then common ones: T, O, I, S, H, etc.

 But without E and A, we have T, O, I, S, H, R (but R is excluded) -> R is excluded? Yes, in our feedback R was x, meaning absent.

 So possible words: 
   ""COST"" is only 4 letters, so no.
   ""CLOUD"" -> C L O U D -> contains O and U (vowels) and L, D. This might be good because it introduces new vowels and consonants.

   ""CHIST""? That's not a word. 
   ""CHISL""? Not a word.

   ""COULY""? Not a common word.

   ""COILS"" -> C, O, I, L, S: all unique and new? But we don't know about S. Also, we haven't tried S, O, I, L.

   ""CIVIL"" -> C, I, V, I, L -> but repeated I? Actually, 'I' appears twice? Spelling ""civil"" has two I's? Position 2 and 4? Actually, word: C-I-V-I-L -> that's one I? Wait: C-I-V-I-L? No, it's C-I-V-I-L? Actually, it has two I's. Positions: 2 and 4. So repeated letter? Not ideal.

   ""CHOMP"" -> C, H, O, M, P. All unique? Yes.

   ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S. This might be good? But note we have S.

   ""CURLY"" -> but contains R -> disallowed? We cannot use R.

   Let me think: avoid R,A,N,E.

   Some candidates:
   - ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D.
   - ""CHOPD""? Not a word.
   - ""CHOPS"": C, H, O, P, S -> valid word? Yes.

   ""CHOPS"": meaning to cut. So ""CHOPS"" is acceptable.

   Another: ""CLOMP""? Not common, but valid? However, not as common as ""CHOPS"".

   ""COVER"": but contains E -> E is disallowed.

   ""QUA?"" -> not starting with C.

   ""C"" and then try to get information about vowels? We know the word doesn't have A or E, so vowels must be O, I, U? Or none? But most English words have vowels.

   Alternatively, ""SPLIT"" -> doesn't start with C.

   We need words starting with C.

   Let me think of common words: 
      ""COULD"" -> uses O, U, L, D -> but U and O?
      ""COAST"" -> but has A -> disallowed? A is excluded.

   ""COAST"" contains A -> so we cannot use A. Hence invalid.

   ""CHART"" -> contains A -> disallowed.

   ""CUT"" -> too short.

   ""CUBIC""? That has two C's? But we already know the first letter is C. The word might have another C? Our feedback for first guess didn't say anything about duplicate C? But we didn't have a duplicate. Now, it's possible? Yes.

   However, to maximize new letters, we might avoid repeating C? But since we only have one C so far? But we don't know if there are duplicates.

   Let me choose a word that avoids duplication and avoids the disallowed letters.

   Words: 
      ""COMBS"" -> C, O, M, B, S -> unique letters? Yes? But ""COMBS"" is a word? Yes (noun meaning the bees' home or verb meaning to groom hair?).

   ""COMET"" -> but E is disallowed.

   ""COMIC"" -> but repeated C? We know position 1 is C, so we would put C at position 1 again? Then the word starts with C. The other C? At position 4? We don't know if that would be correct. But also it has I.

   Let me consider: 
   Criteria: We want to test vowels? Since we've eliminated E and A, we could try O and I? Or U?

   ""COINS"" -> O and I? But contains I, O, N? Wait: does ""COINS"" contain N? COINS: C, O, I, N, S -> but N is disallowed? We know N is not in the word.

   Therefore, we must avoid N.

   So ""COINS"" is invalid because of N.

   ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S -> all new? And no A, E, N, R? Yes.

   Let's try ""CHOPS"": 
      If the word is ""CHOPS"" itself? Then we win? But we don't know yet.

   If not, we can get feedback on H, O, P, S.

   Alternatively, ""CLOUD"" -> C, L, O, U, D -> also good? But U is less common.

   Let me prioritize letters that are more common. Without E, A, R, N, what are the next common? 
   After E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S -> but R, A, N are out -> then common: I, O, T, S.

   So I, O, T, S are good.

   Now, we have positions 2-5: unknown.

   We are trying: 
      Option 1: ""CHOPS"": uses H, O, P, S -> note: H is not among the top? Well, H is common. 
      Option 2: ""COSTS"" -> but repeated S? Not ideal.

   ""COILS"": C, O, I, L, S -> avoids E, A, R, N? Yes. And uses O, I, L, S? L is common.

   So ""COILS"" is a word? Yes, meaning wires wound in a spiral.

   Let me compare ""CHOPS"" and ""COILS"". Both are valid.

   Which one covers more frequent letters?

   Among O, I: O and I are vowel-like. Then L vs H? L is more common than H? 
   Letter frequency: 
        O: 4th? (without E,A,R) -> actually in English, E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S are top. We have R,A,N,E out? So top remaining: I, O, T, S.

   ""CHOPS"": H, O, P, S -> O and S are very common. P is somewhat common? 
   ""COILS"": O, I, L, S -> I, O, S are common? L is also common? Actually L is 12th overall? 

   Both include O and S.

   Now, we want to avoid the possibility that we run into duplicates? 

   Since we don't know if the word has duplicates? We are free to use duplicates? However, for maximum information, unique letters are better.

   Both are unique? 
      ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S: unique? C is at start? We are introducing H,O,P,S -> all distinct? Yes.
      ""COILS"" -> C, O, I, L, S: distinct? Yes.

   ""COILS"" introduces I and L? Which I haven't tried? And O and S. While ""CHOPS"" introduces H and P? 

   But H and P are less common than I and L? Because I is a vowel and more common? 

   According to letter frequency in English:
      I: about 6.9% 
      O: 7.5%
      L: 4%
      S: 6.3%
      H: 6%
      P: 1.9%

   So ""COILS"" has I (6.9%), O (7.5%), L (4%), S (6.3%)? Total? But we don't count the fixed C? Actually, we are only concerned about the new positions? 

   Overall, ""COILS"" provides letters: O (common), I (common), L (medium), S (common). 
   ""CHOPS"" provides: H (about 6%), O (common), P (less common), S (common).

   Therefore, I think ""COILS"" covers more of the common remaining letters? Because H (6%) vs I (almost 7%)? And P is 1.9% vs L at 4%. 

   So ""COILS"" might be slightly better? Especially because L is more common than P.

   Moreover, we are testing two vowels? The word must have vowels? Since we know E and A are out? So O and I are good candidates.

   Therefore, I choose ""COILS"".

   Second guess: ""coils""

   So the guessed word: <guess>coils</guess><reasoning>

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""coils"" -> Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1 (as we already knew).
  - O is absent (so the word does not contain O).
  - I is correct and in position 3? Let's see: 
        Position: 1:C, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:S
    So I is in position 3 and correct (✓).
  - L is correct and in position 4 (since it's the 4th letter and marked ✓).
  - S is absent.

So now we know:
- The word starts with C (position 1).
- Position 3 is I.
- Position 4 is L.
- The word does not contain: R, A, N, E, O, S. (from the x's in both guesses)
- The word does contain I and L, but we already have their positions.

Also, note that in ""coils"", the O and S were absent, so we add O and S to the absent letters.

Current known:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: ? (unknown, but cannot be O, R, A, N, E, S)
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: ? (unknown, but cannot be O, R, A, N, E, S)

We also know the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Now, what letters are possible for position 2 and 5?
We have eliminated: R, A, N, E, O, S.

So the available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we have I and L in the word, but they are already placed. So we don't need to test them again? Actually, we don't know if they appear again? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? However, in the feedback for ""coils"", we had I and L marked correct, but if there were duplicates, we might not know? But in Wordle, if a letter appears only once and you use it twice, one might be marked as absent? But in this case, we didn't use duplicates.

But we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we don't have any indication so far.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits:
  C _ I L _

And the missing letters (position 2 and 5) must be from the available set.

We also want to maximize information? But we have two positions to fill. We might be able to guess the word? Or we can try to test more letters.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess? We have 6 tries total, so we have 4 left? But we might get it.

Let's think of possible words that fit the pattern: C _ I L _

With the constraints on the missing letters.

Possible letters for position 2: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Position 5: same set? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

Common words that fit:
  ""CHILL"": C H I L L -> but we have L at position 4 and then L at position 5? So duplicate L? And we know L is in position 4, so if we put L at position 5, it might be correct? But we don't know if L is duplicated? Also, in our second guess, we had L at position 4 and it was correct, but we didn't have L at position 5? So if the word has two L's, then in ""coils"" we only had one L? Then the feedback for the L in position 4 would be correct, but we wouldn't know about the other L? Actually, in Wordle, if the word has two L's and you guess one L in the correct position and no other L, then the feedback would only show one L as correct? But if you guess a word with one L and the word has two, then the feedback might not indicate the missing one? Actually, the feedback only tells you about the letters you guessed? So if the word has two L's and you only guess one, then you won't know about the second one? 

But in this case, we are trying to guess the word. We have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, without evidence, we might assume no duplicates? But we can't.

But let's list possible words:

  ""CHILL"": C H I L L -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L -> but we have position 4 as L, and then position 5 as L? But we don't know if L is duplicated? Also, H is allowed? And we haven't tested H? But in the second guess, we didn't use H? So H is a possibility.

  ""CHILD"": C H I L D -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D -> this is a valid word? Yes.

  ""CIVIL"": C I V I L -> but wait, position 3 is I? But in ""CIVIL"", position 2 is I? Then position 3 is V? But we have position 3 fixed as I? So ""CIVIL"" would be: C (1), I (2), V (3), I (4), L (5) -> but we need position 3 to be I? In ""CIVIL"", position 3 is V, not I? So it doesn't fit? Because we have position 3 fixed as I? So ""CIVIL"" is not matching.

  ""BUILD""? Doesn't start with C.

  ""CLIMB"": C L I M B -> but we have position 4 as L? In ""CLIMB"": position 1:C, 2:L, 3:I, 4:M, 5:B -> but we need position 4 to be L? So it doesn't match.

  We need position 3 to be I and position 4 to be L? So the pattern is: C (letter2) I L (letter5)

  Other words:
    ""CHILI""? But that's 5 letters? C-H-I-L-I -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:I -> so it fits? But we have two I's? And we know I is in position 3? Then position 5 is I? So that's possible? But we haven't tested I in position 5? And we don't know if I can be duplicated? Also, in the second guess, we had I only at position 3? So if the word has two I's, we wouldn't know? 

  ""CHILL"" and ""CHILI"" and ""CHILD"" are candidates.

  Also, ""CIVIL"" doesn't fit because position 3 is V, not I? But we have position 3 fixed as I.

  ""TRAIL""? But T and R? R is excluded? And doesn't start with C.

  ""FLAIL""? Doesn't start with C and has A? A is excluded.

  ""QUAIL""? Same.

  So let's list possible words that start with C, have I at position 3, L at position 4, and the second letter and fifth letter from the allowed set.

  For position 2: we have many options: H, T, U, V, W, etc.

  Common words:
    - CHILL
    - CHILD
    - CHILI
    - CRILL? Not a word.
    - CVILL? Not a word.

  Also, ""CECIL""? But C is at position 1 and then E? But E is excluded? So no.

  ""COLIC""? But O is excluded? And we have position 3 as I? ""COLIC"": C O L I C -> but position 3 is L? Not I? So doesn't fit.

  ""CUBIC""? C U B I C -> but position 3 is B? Not I? So no.

  ""CIVIC""? C I V I C -> position 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:C -> but we need position 3 to be I? It's V? So no.

  So the main candidates are: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI.

  Also, ""CHIRL""? Not a word.

  ""CHIRP""? But then position 4 would be R? But we need L at position 4? And R is excluded? So no.

  ""CHIRL"" not a word.

  ""CHIRM""? Not common? And position 4 would be R? No.

  So we have:
    CHILL: C H I L L
    CHILD: C H I L D
    CHILI: C H I L I

  Also, ""CHIEL""? But E is excluded? And position 5 is L? But we have position 4 as L? So ""CHIEL"" would be C H I E L -> but E is excluded? And position 4 is E? But we need L at position 4? So no.

  ""CHIRK""? But R is excluded? And position 4 would be R? No.

  ""CHIRT""? Same.

  ""CHIVE""? But E is excluded? And position 5 is E? No.

  ""CHIMP""? But position 4 would be M? Not L? So no.

  So the only common words I can think of are: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI.

  Now, we have to choose one? But we don't know which one? We have to test.

  We can try to guess one of them? But if we guess wrong, we get feedback and then we can guess again? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can try.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions to fill? And we know the pattern? So we might as well guess one of the candidates? But which one?

  But note: we haven't tested the letter H? In the second guess we didn't use H? So we don't know if H is in the word? But in the pattern, position 2 is H in all these candidates? So if we guess a word that doesn't have H? But we don't have any candidate without H? So we must test H? Actually, if we guess one of these, we will find out about H? Because if the word is CHILL, then H is present? But if we guess CHILL and the word is CHILD, then we get feedback that H is correct? But we already know that? Because we are putting H in position 2? And if it's correct, then we get H(✓) and then we know? But we also get the last letter? 

  However, we have three candidates: 
      CHILL: last letter L -> but we already know L is in the word? But if we guess CHILL, then the last letter L? We don't know if it's correct? But we know position 4 is L? So if we put L at position 5, it might be correct? Or not? 

  But in the feedback for ""coils"", we had L at position 4 correct? But we don't know if there is another L? So if we guess CHILL, and the word is CHILL, then we get all correct? If the word is CHILD, then we get: 
        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(?) -> but the last letter is L? But the word is CHILD, so last letter is D? So the last L would be absent? And we get feedback: L at position 5 is absent? Then we know it's not CHILL? Then we can guess CHILD? 

  Similarly, if we guess CHILD and the word is CHILL, then we get: 
        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> then we know the last letter is not D? Then we can guess CHILL? 

  But we have only two positions to fill? And we are testing the last letter? 

  Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't have H? But then we can test if H is present? But we don't have a candidate without H? So we must test H? 

  But note: we can also test multiple letters? For example, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a different last letter? But we don't know the last letter? 

  However, we have three candidates? We can try to guess a word that is not one of the candidates? But that might not be efficient? 

  Let me think: we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, or I? But we don't know? 

  But we want to maximize information? We have two unknowns: 
      - Is H in the word? (but in the pattern, position 2 must be H? because all candidates have H? So if we don't put H, then we might not get the word? But we don't know if H is the only possibility? 

  Actually, are there other words? For example, ""CVILL"" is not a word? ""CWHIL""? Not a word? ""CZHIL""? No? 

  What about ""CABIL""? But A is excluded? 

  ""CEDIL""? E excluded? 

  ""CFILM""? Not a word? 

  ""CHIRL""? Not a word? 

  So it seems the only common words are CHILL, CHILD, CHILI? 

  But wait, ""CHILI"" has two I's? So if we guess ""CHILI"", then we have I at position 3 and 5? 

  Now, we haven't tested for duplicate I? In the second guess, we had I at position 3? And we don't know if there is another I? 

  So the candidates are:
      CHILL: C H I L L
      CHILD: C H I L D
      CHILI: C H I L I

  We can try to guess one of them? 

  But we have 4 guesses? So we can try one? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the last letter? But we don't have a word that covers multiple? 

  But note: we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, or I? But that might not be a word? 

  For example, ""CHIRP""? But R is excluded? 

  ""CHINK""? But N is excluded? 

  ""CHIMP""? But M? And position 4 would be M? But we need L at position 4? So we cannot change position 4? 

  We have to keep position 3 as I and position 4 as L? 

  So we are forced to have the pattern: C H I L ? 

  And the last letter must be one of: L, D, I? (from the candidates) but also other possibilities? But we don't have other common words? 

  What about ""CHIEL""? But E excluded? 

  ""CHIRL""? Not a word? 

  ""CHIZZ""? Not a word? 

  ""CHIVY""? But V? And E? Excluded? 

  So I think the only common words are the three: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI. 

  Now, we can try to guess ""CHILL"" first? 

  If it's correct, we win? 

  If not, we get feedback: 
      If the word is CHILD: 
          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(x) -> because the last letter is D, not L? 
      Then we know the last letter is not L? So we can try CHILD? 

      If the word is CHILI: 
          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(?) -> but the last letter of CHILI is I? So we have L at position 5? But the word has I at position 5? So L would be absent? Then we get: L(x) at position 5? Then we know it's not CHILL? Then we can try CHILI? 

  But wait, if we guess CHILL and the word is CHILI, we get:
        Position 1: C ✓
        Position 2: H ✓ (if H is correct? But in CHILI, position 2 is H? So H is correct? 
        Position 3: I ✓
        Position 4: L ✓
        Position 5: L -> but the word has I at position 5? So L is not present? Because the word CHILI has only one L? At position 4? So the L at position 5 is absent? So we get: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(x)

  Then we know the last letter is not L? So we can try CHILD? But if we try CHILD and the word is CHILI, then we get:
        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> because last letter is I, not D? 
        Then we know it's not CHILD? Then we try CHILI? 

  So we might need two more guesses? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the last letter without committing to H? But we don't have a word? 

  Or we can try a word that has a different second letter? But we don't know any other second letter? 

  But wait, is it possible that the second letter is not H? We assumed it must be H? But are there other words? 

  Let me double-check: 
      Pattern: C _ I L _ 
      With the missing letters not in {R, A, N, E, O, S}

  Other words? 
      ""CUTIN""? But position 4 is I? Not L? 
      ""CIVIL"" we already saw doesn't fit? 
      ""CLIFT""? But position 2 is L? Then position 3 is I? Position 4 is F? Not L? 
      ""CLINT""? But N is excluded? 
      ""CLIPT""? Not a word? 
      ""CULCH""? But position 3 is L? Not I? 
      ""CULTI""? C U L T I -> position 3 is L? Not I? 
      ""CURIO""? But O is excluded? 
      ""CURVY""? But position 3 is R? Excluded? 
      ""CWTCH""? Not a word? 
      ""CYCLO""? O excluded? 

  What about ""CHIRP""? Not? 

  ""CHIPS""? But S is excluded? And position 4 is P? Not L? 

  So I think H is the only possibility for position 2? 

  Therefore, we must have H at position 2? 

  Then the word is C H I L ? 

  And the last letter must be one of: L, D, I? 

  Now, we can try to guess ""CHILD"" because it has a different last letter? 

  But we don't know? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, I? But that would not be a candidate? And we might waste a guess? 

  But we can try to test multiple letters? For example, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then in the last position, we put a letter that is common? But we don't know? 

  However, we have only three candidates? So we can try one? 

  Let me choose ""CHILD"" as the guess? Because it has a D? And we haven't tested D? 

  If we guess ""CHILD"": 
      If the word is CHILD: we win? 
      If the word is CHILL: we get feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> then we know the last letter is not D? So we try CHILL? 
      If the word is CHILI: we get feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> same as above? Then we know it's not D? Then we try CHILI? 

  But wait, if we get D(x) for both CHILL and CHILI? Then we don't know which one? Because both CHILL and CHILI have last letter not D? So we would have to try both? 

  Actually, if we guess ""CHILD"" and the word is CHILL, we get D(x) and then we know the last letter is not D? Then we try CHILL? 
  If we guess ""CHILD"" and the word is CHILI, we get D(x) and then we try CHILI? 

  But we don't know which one? So we might need to try both? 

  Alternatively, we can try ""CHILI"": 
      If the word is CHILI: win? 
      If the word is CHILL: we get last letter L? But wait, in ""CHILI"", we have I at position 5? But the word CHILL has L at position 5? So we get: 
          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) I(?) -> for CHILL, the last letter is L? So the I at position 5 is absent? Because CHILL has only one I? At position 3? So we get I(x) at position 5? 
      Then we know the last letter is not I? So we try CHILL? 
      If the word is CHILD: we get I(x) at position 5? Then we know the last letter is not I? So we try CHILD? 

  But again, we don't know which one? 

  So in either case, if we guess one candidate and it's wrong, we get the last letter wrong? And then we know to try the other two? But we have two left? Then we can try one of the remaining two? 

  Since we have 4 guesses left? We can do: 
      Guess 3: CHILD 
      If correct, done.
      If not, then we get feedback: 
          If the word is CHILL: we get D(x) -> then we know to try CHILL next? 
          If the word is CHILI: we get D(x) -> then we know to try CHILI next? 
      Then guess 4: either CHILL or CHILI? But we don't know which one? 

  But we don't know which one? So we have to choose arbitrarily? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that is not a candidate? But that tests the last letter? 

  For example, we can try a word that has the same pattern but with a different last letter? But we don't know? 

  But we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, I? But that might not be a word? 

  For example, ""CHIRP"" is not allowed? 

  ""CHIMB""? Not a word? 

  ""CHIMP""? But then position 4 would be M? But we have to keep position 4 as L? 

  We cannot change position 4? 

  So we are stuck? 

  Another idea: we can try a word that has the same pattern but with a letter that we haven't used? For example, ""CHIML""? Not a word? 

  Or ""CHUGL""? Not a word? 

  So I think we have to guess one of the candidates? 

  Let me choose ""CHILD"" as the third guess? 

  If it's correct, we win? 

  If not, we get feedback that the last letter is not D? Then we have two options: CHILL and CHILI? 

  Then we can try ""CHILL"" next? If it's not, then it must be ""CHILI""? 

  But we have 4 guesses? So we can do that? 

  Alternatively, we can try to test for duplicate I? But how? 

  We can try a word that has I at position 5? But we don't have a word that has I at position 5 and H at position 2? But ""CHILI"" does? But that's a candidate? 

  Or we can try a word that has I at a different position? But we don't know? 

  For example, we can try ""DUTCH""? But doesn't start with C? 

  ""PITCH""? But position 1 is P? 

  We need to start with C? 

  ""C"" and then a word that has I at position 5? But we have position 3 fixed as I? So if we put I at position 5, then we have two I's? 

  For example, ""CUBIC""? But position 3 is B? Not I? 

  ""CIVIC""? But position 3 is V? 

  ""CONIC""? O excluded? 

  ""CYNIC""? But position 3 is N? Excluded? 

  ""CURVY""? Not? 

  So I think it's not easy to test for duplicate I? 

  Therefore, I will go with ""CHILD"" as the third guess? 

  But let's see the feedback we have: we know position 1,3,4 are fixed? And position 2 must be H? And position 5 is unknown? 

  So I'll guess ""CHILD"". 

  But note: in the feedback for ""coils"", we had S absent? But in ""CHILD"", there is no S? So that's fine? 

  So guess: ""child""

  But wait, we have to output in the format.

  Alternatively, we can try to think of a word that tests more letters? But we have only two positions? And one of them we are confident is H? 

  So I think it's acceptable to guess ""CHILD"". 

  If we are wrong, we get information about the last letter? 

  So let's do that.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  - **C** is correct and in position 1.  
  - **R, A, N, E** are absent from the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""coils"" → Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)**  
  - **C** is correct (position 1, already known).  
  - **O** is absent.  
  - **I** is correct and in position 3.  
  - **L** is correct and in position 4.  
  - **S** is absent.  

### Key Insights
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **C**  
   - Position 3: **I**  
   - Position 4: **L**  
   - The word structure is: **C _ I L _** (only positions 2 and 5 are unknown).  

2. **Absent letters**:  
   - **R, A, N, E, O, S** cannot appear anywhere in the word.  

3. **Possible letters for positions 2 and 5**:  
   - Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   - Available vowels (since E, A, O are out): I, U (but I is already used at position 3; duplicates are possible).  

4. **Candidate words**:  
   - After eliminating invalid letters, common English words fitting **C _ I L _** are:  
     - **CHILL** (C H I L L)  
     - **CHILD** (C H I L D)  
     - **CHILI** (C H I L I)  
   - All candidates share **H** in position 2.  

### Strategy for Guess 3
- **Goal**: Test the variable position 5 (last letter) while confirming **H** in position 2.  
- **Why ""child""?**  
  - It tests **H** in position 2 (common to all candidates).  
  - It tests **D** in position 5 (which, if absent, eliminates **CHILD** and narrows to **CHILL** or **CHILI**).  
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle. If not, feedback on **D** will reduce possibilities for the next guess.  
- **Risk**: If **D** is absent, we still have 3 guesses left to distinguish between **CHILL** and **CHILI**.  

### Next Steps
- If **D** is correct (✓), the word is **CHILD**.  
- If **D** is absent (x), the word is either **CHILL** or **CHILI** (guess **CHILL** next).  

<guess>child</guess>",child,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""coils"" -> Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1 (as we already knew).
  - O is absent (so the word does not contain O).
  - I is correct and in position 3? Let's see: 
        Position: 1:C, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:S
    So I is in position 3 and correct (✓).
  - L is correct and in position 4 (since it's the 4th letter and marked ✓).
  - S is absent.

So now we know:
- The word starts with C (position 1).
- Position 3 is I.
- Position 4 is L.
- The word does not contain: R, A, N, E, O, S. (from the x's in both guesses)
- The word does contain I and L, but we already have their positions.

Also, note that in ""coils"", the O and S were absent, so we add O and S to the absent letters.

Current known:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: ? (unknown, but cannot be O, R, A, N, E, S)
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: ? (unknown, but cannot be O, R, A, N, E, S)

We also know the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Now, what letters are possible for position 2 and 5?
We have eliminated: R, A, N, E, O, S.

So the available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we have I and L in the word, but they are already placed. So we don't need to test them again? Actually, we don't know if they appear again? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? However, in the feedback for ""coils"", we had I and L marked correct, but if there were duplicates, we might not know? But in Wordle, if a letter appears only once and you use it twice, one might be marked as absent? But in this case, we didn't use duplicates.

But we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we don't have any indication so far.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits:
  C _ I L _

And the missing letters (position 2 and 5) must be from the available set.

We also want to maximize information? But we have two positions to fill. We might be able to guess the word? Or we can try to test more letters.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess? We have 6 tries total, so we have 4 left? But we might get it.

Let's think of possible words that fit the pattern: C _ I L _

With the constraints on the missing letters.

Possible letters for position 2: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Position 5: same set? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

Common words that fit:
  ""CHILL"": C H I L L -> but we have L at position 4 and then L at position 5? So duplicate L? And we know L is in position 4, so if we put L at position 5, it might be correct? But we don't know if L is duplicated? Also, in our second guess, we had L at position 4 and it was correct, but we didn't have L at position 5? So if the word has two L's, then in ""coils"" we only had one L? Then the feedback for the L in position 4 would be correct, but we wouldn't know about the other L? Actually, in Wordle, if the word has two L's and you guess one L in the correct position and no other L, then the feedback would only show one L as correct? But if you guess a word with one L and the word has two, then the feedback might not indicate the missing one? Actually, the feedback only tells you about the letters you guessed? So if the word has two L's and you only guess one, then you won't know about the second one? 

But in this case, we are trying to guess the word. We have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, without evidence, we might assume no duplicates? But we can't.

But let's list possible words:

  ""CHILL"": C H I L L -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L -> but we have position 4 as L, and then position 5 as L? But we don't know if L is duplicated? Also, H is allowed? And we haven't tested H? But in the second guess, we didn't use H? So H is a possibility.

  ""CHILD"": C H I L D -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D -> this is a valid word? Yes.

  ""CIVIL"": C I V I L -> but wait, position 3 is I? But in ""CIVIL"", position 2 is I? Then position 3 is V? But we have position 3 fixed as I? So ""CIVIL"" would be: C (1), I (2), V (3), I (4), L (5) -> but we need position 3 to be I? In ""CIVIL"", position 3 is V, not I? So it doesn't fit? Because we have position 3 fixed as I? So ""CIVIL"" is not matching.

  ""BUILD""? Doesn't start with C.

  ""CLIMB"": C L I M B -> but we have position 4 as L? In ""CLIMB"": position 1:C, 2:L, 3:I, 4:M, 5:B -> but we need position 4 to be L? So it doesn't match.

  We need position 3 to be I and position 4 to be L? So the pattern is: C (letter2) I L (letter5)

  Other words:
    ""CHILI""? But that's 5 letters? C-H-I-L-I -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:I -> so it fits? But we have two I's? And we know I is in position 3? Then position 5 is I? So that's possible? But we haven't tested I in position 5? And we don't know if I can be duplicated? Also, in the second guess, we had I only at position 3? So if the word has two I's, we wouldn't know? 

  ""CHILL"" and ""CHILI"" and ""CHILD"" are candidates.

  Also, ""CIVIL"" doesn't fit because position 3 is V, not I? But we have position 3 fixed as I.

  ""TRAIL""? But T and R? R is excluded? And doesn't start with C.

  ""FLAIL""? Doesn't start with C and has A? A is excluded.

  ""QUAIL""? Same.

  So let's list possible words that start with C, have I at position 3, L at position 4, and the second letter and fifth letter from the allowed set.

  For position 2: we have many options: H, T, U, V, W, etc.

  Common words:
    - CHILL
    - CHILD
    - CHILI
    - CRILL? Not a word.
    - CVILL? Not a word.

  Also, ""CECIL""? But C is at position 1 and then E? But E is excluded? So no.

  ""COLIC""? But O is excluded? And we have position 3 as I? ""COLIC"": C O L I C -> but position 3 is L? Not I? So doesn't fit.

  ""CUBIC""? C U B I C -> but position 3 is B? Not I? So no.

  ""CIVIC""? C I V I C -> position 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:C -> but we need position 3 to be I? It's V? So no.

  So the main candidates are: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI.

  Also, ""CHIRL""? Not a word.

  ""CHIRP""? But then position 4 would be R? But we need L at position 4? And R is excluded? So no.

  ""CHIRL"" not a word.

  ""CHIRM""? Not common? And position 4 would be R? No.

  So we have:
    CHILL: C H I L L
    CHILD: C H I L D
    CHILI: C H I L I

  Also, ""CHIEL""? But E is excluded? And position 5 is L? But we have position 4 as L? So ""CHIEL"" would be C H I E L -> but E is excluded? And position 4 is E? But we need L at position 4? So no.

  ""CHIRK""? But R is excluded? And position 4 would be R? No.

  ""CHIRT""? Same.

  ""CHIVE""? But E is excluded? And position 5 is E? No.

  ""CHIMP""? But position 4 would be M? Not L? So no.

  So the only common words I can think of are: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI.

  Now, we have to choose one? But we don't know which one? We have to test.

  We can try to guess one of them? But if we guess wrong, we get feedback and then we can guess again? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can try.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions to fill? And we know the pattern? So we might as well guess one of the candidates? But which one?

  But note: we haven't tested the letter H? In the second guess we didn't use H? So we don't know if H is in the word? But in the pattern, position 2 is H in all these candidates? So if we guess a word that doesn't have H? But we don't have any candidate without H? So we must test H? Actually, if we guess one of these, we will find out about H? Because if the word is CHILL, then H is present? But if we guess CHILL and the word is CHILD, then we get feedback that H is correct? But we already know that? Because we are putting H in position 2? And if it's correct, then we get H(✓) and then we know? But we also get the last letter? 

  However, we have three candidates: 
      CHILL: last letter L -> but we already know L is in the word? But if we guess CHILL, then the last letter L? We don't know if it's correct? But we know position 4 is L? So if we put L at position 5, it might be correct? Or not? 

  But in the feedback for ""coils"", we had L at position 4 correct? But we don't know if there is another L? So if we guess CHILL, and the word is CHILL, then we get all correct? If the word is CHILD, then we get: 
        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(?) -> but the last letter is L? But the word is CHILD, so last letter is D? So the last L would be absent? And we get feedback: L at position 5 is absent? Then we know it's not CHILL? Then we can guess CHILD? 

  Similarly, if we guess CHILD and the word is CHILL, then we get: 
        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> then we know the last letter is not D? Then we can guess CHILL? 

  But we have only two positions to fill? And we are testing the last letter? 

  Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't have H? But then we can test if H is present? But we don't have a candidate without H? So we must test H? 

  But note: we can also test multiple letters? For example, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a different last letter? But we don't know the last letter? 

  However, we have three candidates? We can try to guess a word that is not one of the candidates? But that might not be efficient? 

  Let me think: we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, or I? But we don't know? 

  But we want to maximize information? We have two unknowns: 
      - Is H in the word? (but in the pattern, position 2 must be H? because all candidates have H? So if we don't put H, then we might not get the word? But we don't know if H is the only possibility? 

  Actually, are there other words? For example, ""CVILL"" is not a word? ""CWHIL""? Not a word? ""CZHIL""? No? 

  What about ""CABIL""? But A is excluded? 

  ""CEDIL""? E excluded? 

  ""CFILM""? Not a word? 

  ""CHIRL""? Not a word? 

  So it seems the only common words are CHILL, CHILD, CHILI? 

  But wait, ""CHILI"" has two I's? So if we guess ""CHILI"", then we have I at position 3 and 5? 

  Now, we haven't tested for duplicate I? In the second guess, we had I at position 3? And we don't know if there is another I? 

  So the candidates are:
      CHILL: C H I L L
      CHILD: C H I L D
      CHILI: C H I L I

  We can try to guess one of them? 

  But we have 4 guesses? So we can try one? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the last letter? But we don't have a word that covers multiple? 

  But note: we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, or I? But that might not be a word? 

  For example, ""CHIRP""? But R is excluded? 

  ""CHINK""? But N is excluded? 

  ""CHIMP""? But M? And position 4 would be M? But we need L at position 4? So we cannot change position 4? 

  We have to keep position 3 as I and position 4 as L? 

  So we are forced to have the pattern: C H I L ? 

  And the last letter must be one of: L, D, I? (from the candidates) but also other possibilities? But we don't have other common words? 

  What about ""CHIEL""? But E excluded? 

  ""CHIRL""? Not a word? 

  ""CHIZZ""? Not a word? 

  ""CHIVY""? But V? And E? Excluded? 

  So I think the only common words are the three: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI. 

  Now, we can try to guess ""CHILL"" first? 

  If it's correct, we win? 

  If not, we get feedback: 
      If the word is CHILD: 
          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(x) -> because the last letter is D, not L? 
      Then we know the last letter is not L? So we can try CHILD? 

      If the word is CHILI: 
          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(?) -> but the last letter of CHILI is I? So we have L at position 5? But the word has I at position 5? So L would be absent? Then we get: L(x) at position 5? Then we know it's not CHILL? Then we can try CHILI? 

  But wait, if we guess CHILL and the word is CHILI, we get:
        Position 1: C ✓
        Position 2: H ✓ (if H is correct? But in CHILI, position 2 is H? So H is correct? 
        Position 3: I ✓
        Position 4: L ✓
        Position 5: L -> but the word has I at position 5? So L is not present? Because the word CHILI has only one L? At position 4? So the L at position 5 is absent? So we get: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(x)

  Then we know the last letter is not L? So we can try CHILD? But if we try CHILD and the word is CHILI, then we get:
        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> because last letter is I, not D? 
        Then we know it's not CHILD? Then we try CHILI? 

  So we might need two more guesses? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the last letter without committing to H? But we don't have a word? 

  Or we can try a word that has a different second letter? But we don't know any other second letter? 

  But wait, is it possible that the second letter is not H? We assumed it must be H? But are there other words? 

  Let me double-check: 
      Pattern: C _ I L _ 
      With the missing letters not in {R, A, N, E, O, S}

  Other words? 
      ""CUTIN""? But position 4 is I? Not L? 
      ""CIVIL"" we already saw doesn't fit? 
      ""CLIFT""? But position 2 is L? Then position 3 is I? Position 4 is F? Not L? 
      ""CLINT""? But N is excluded? 
      ""CLIPT""? Not a word? 
      ""CULCH""? But position 3 is L? Not I? 
      ""CULTI""? C U L T I -> position 3 is L? Not I? 
      ""CURIO""? But O is excluded? 
      ""CURVY""? But position 3 is R? Excluded? 
      ""CWTCH""? Not a word? 
      ""CYCLO""? O excluded? 

  What about ""CHIRP""? Not? 

  ""CHIPS""? But S is excluded? And position 4 is P? Not L? 

  So I think H is the only possibility for position 2? 

  Therefore, we must have H at position 2? 

  Then the word is C H I L ? 

  And the last letter must be one of: L, D, I? 

  Now, we can try to guess ""CHILD"" because it has a different last letter? 

  But we don't know? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, I? But that would not be a candidate? And we might waste a guess? 

  But we can try to test multiple letters? For example, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then in the last position, we put a letter that is common? But we don't know? 

  However, we have only three candidates? So we can try one? 

  Let me choose ""CHILD"" as the guess? Because it has a D? And we haven't tested D? 

  If we guess ""CHILD"": 
      If the word is CHILD: we win? 
      If the word is CHILL: we get feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> then we know the last letter is not D? So we try CHILL? 
      If the word is CHILI: we get feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> same as above? Then we know it's not D? Then we try CHILI? 

  But wait, if we get D(x) for both CHILL and CHILI? Then we don't know which one? Because both CHILL and CHILI have last letter not D? So we would have to try both? 

  Actually, if we guess ""CHILD"" and the word is CHILL, we get D(x) and then we know the last letter is not D? Then we try CHILL? 
  If we guess ""CHILD"" and the word is CHILI, we get D(x) and then we try CHILI? 

  But we don't know which one? So we might need to try both? 

  Alternatively, we can try ""CHILI"": 
      If the word is CHILI: win? 
      If the word is CHILL: we get last letter L? But wait, in ""CHILI"", we have I at position 5? But the word CHILL has L at position 5? So we get: 
          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) I(?) -> for CHILL, the last letter is L? So the I at position 5 is absent? Because CHILL has only one I? At position 3? So we get I(x) at position 5? 
      Then we know the last letter is not I? So we try CHILL? 
      If the word is CHILD: we get I(x) at position 5? Then we know the last letter is not I? So we try CHILD? 

  But again, we don't know which one? 

  So in either case, if we guess one candidate and it's wrong, we get the last letter wrong? And then we know to try the other two? But we have two left? Then we can try one of the remaining two? 

  Since we have 4 guesses left? We can do: 
      Guess 3: CHILD 
      If correct, done.
      If not, then we get feedback: 
          If the word is CHILL: we get D(x) -> then we know to try CHILL next? 
          If the word is CHILI: we get D(x) -> then we know to try CHILI next? 
      Then guess 4: either CHILL or CHILI? But we don't know which one? 

  But we don't know which one? So we have to choose arbitrarily? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that is not a candidate? But that tests the last letter? 

  For example, we can try a word that has the same pattern but with a different last letter? But we don't know? 

  But we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, I? But that might not be a word? 

  For example, ""CHIRP"" is not allowed? 

  ""CHIMB""? Not a word? 

  ""CHIMP""? But then position 4 would be M? But we have to keep position 4 as L? 

  We cannot change position 4? 

  So we are stuck? 

  Another idea: we can try a word that has the same pattern but with a letter that we haven't used? For example, ""CHIML""? Not a word? 

  Or ""CHUGL""? Not a word? 

  So I think we have to guess one of the candidates? 

  Let me choose ""CHILD"" as the third guess? 

  If it's correct, we win? 

  If not, we get feedback that the last letter is not D? Then we have two options: CHILL and CHILI? 

  Then we can try ""CHILL"" next? If it's not, then it must be ""CHILI""? 

  But we have 4 guesses? So we can do that? 

  Alternatively, we can try to test for duplicate I? But how? 

  We can try a word that has I at position 5? But we don't have a word that has I at position 5 and H at position 2? But ""CHILI"" does? But that's a candidate? 

  Or we can try a word that has I at a different position? But we don't know? 

  For example, we can try ""DUTCH""? But doesn't start with C? 

  ""PITCH""? But position 1 is P? 

  We need to start with C? 

  ""C"" and then a word that has I at position 5? But we have position 3 fixed as I? So if we put I at position 5, then we have two I's? 

  For example, ""CUBIC""? But position 3 is B? Not I? 

  ""CIVIC""? But position 3 is V? 

  ""CONIC""? O excluded? 

  ""CYNIC""? But position 3 is N? Excluded? 

  ""CURVY""? Not? 

  So I think it's not easy to test for duplicate I? 

  Therefore, I will go with ""CHILD"" as the third guess? 

  But let's see the feedback we have: we know position 1,3,4 are fixed? And position 2 must be H? And position 5 is unknown? 

  So I'll guess ""CHILD"". 

  But note: in the feedback for ""coils"", we had S absent? But in ""CHILD"", there is no S? So that's fine? 

  So guess: ""child""

  But wait, we have to output in the format.

  Alternatively, we can try to think of a word that tests more letters? But we have only two positions? And one of them we are confident is H? 

  So I think it's acceptable to guess ""CHILD"". 

  If we are wrong, we get information about the last letter? 

  So let's do that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  - **C** is correct and in position 1.  
  - **R, A, N, E** are absent from the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""coils"" → Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)**  
  - **C** is correct (position 1, already known).  
  - **O** is absent.  
  - **I** is correct and in position 3.  
  - **L** is correct and in position 4.  
  - **S** is absent.  

### Key Insights
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **C**  
   - Position 3: **I**  
   - Position 4: **L**  
   - The word structure is: **C _ I L _** (only positions 2 and 5 are unknown).  

2. **Absent letters**:  
   - **R, A, N, E, O, S** cannot appear anywhere in the word.  

3. **Possible letters for positions 2 and 5**:  
   - Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   - Available vowels (since E, A, O are out): I, U (but I is already used at position 3; duplicates are possible).  

4. **Candidate words**:  
   - After eliminating invalid letters, common English words fitting **C _ I L _** are:  
     - **CHILL** (C H I L L)  
     - **CHILD** (C H I L D)  
     - **CHILI** (C H I L I)  
   - All candidates share **H** in position 2.  

### Strategy for Guess 3
- **Goal**: Test the variable position 5 (last letter) while confirming **H** in position 2.  
- **Why ""child""?**  
  - It tests **H** in position 2 (common to all candidates).  
  - It tests **D** in position 5 (which, if absent, eliminates **CHILD** and narrows to **CHILL** or **CHILI**).  
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle. If not, feedback on **D** will reduce possibilities for the next guess.  
- **Risk**: If **D** is absent, we still have 3 guesses left to distinguish between **CHILL** and **CHILI**.  

### Next Steps
- If **D** is correct (✓), the word is **CHILD**.  
- If **D** is absent (x), the word is either **CHILL** or **CHILI** (guess **CHILL** next).",Guess 3: child -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all fairly common in English words.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"":
 Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R, A, N, E are all not in the word at all (marked with x).

 Important note: Since only C is correct and in position 1, and the other letters are absent, we know:
 - The first letter is C.
 - The word does not contain R, A, N, or E.

 We need to make a second guess. The word starts with C, and does not contain R, A, N, E.

 Let's think about possible words that start with C and avoid the letters R,A,N,E.

 Since we have only one correct letter so far, we want to use this guess to get more information about the other letters.

 We should choose a word that:
 1. Starts with C (since position 1 is fixed as C).
 2. Uses new letters that we haven't tried yet to maximize information.

 Avoid using any of the disallowed letters: R, A, N, E.

 Available letters: We can use letters from the rest of the alphabet excluding R,A,N,E.

 We also want to cover common letters. Common consonants might be T, L, S, etc., and vowels might be I, O, U (since E,A are out).

 Let me try to think of a word that starts with C and has other common letters.

 Some possibilities: 
 - Could try words like ""C"" + a combination of T, L, S, H, O, I, U, etc.

 Examples: 
   ""CHILL"", but we have 5 letters and ""CHILL"" is 5 letters? Let's check: C-H-I-L-L -> but it has L repeated? Actually, ""CHILL"" is C-H-I-L-L, so yes. However, repeated L might not be ideal for information.
   ""CLIMB"" -> C, L, I, M, B -> only unique letters? Yes.

 Let me list some words:
   ""COULD"" -> contains O, U, L, D -> but O and U are vowels? Actually, we don't know about vowels yet except that A and E are not present.
   ""C"" followed by other popular letters: T, L, S, H, O, I, U, etc.

 We have already eliminated 4 letters: R, A, N, E. So we have 22 letters left.

 Since we need to maximize information, we should try to include letters that are frequent in 5-letter words.

 According to English letter frequency, after the top letters we've excluded, we have: 
   E (excluded), A (excluded), then common ones: T, O, I, S, H, etc.

 But without E and A, we have T, O, I, S, H, R (but R is excluded) -> R is excluded? Yes, in our feedback R was x, meaning absent.

 So possible words: 
   ""COST"" is only 4 letters, so no.
   ""CLOUD"" -> C L O U D -> contains O and U (vowels) and L, D. This might be good because it introduces new vowels and consonants.

   ""CHIST""? That's not a word. 
   ""CHISL""? Not a word.

   ""COULY""? Not a common word.

   ""COILS"" -> C, O, I, L, S: all unique and new? But we don't know about S. Also, we haven't tried S, O, I, L.

   ""CIVIL"" -> C, I, V, I, L -> but repeated I? Actually, 'I' appears twice? Spelling ""civil"" has two I's? Position 2 and 4? Actually, word: C-I-V-I-L -> that's one I? Wait: C-I-V-I-L? No, it's C-I-V-I-L? Actually, it has two I's. Positions: 2 and 4. So repeated letter? Not ideal.

   ""CHOMP"" -> C, H, O, M, P. All unique? Yes.

   ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S. This might be good? But note we have S.

   ""CURLY"" -> but contains R -> disallowed? We cannot use R.

   Let me think: avoid R,A,N,E.

   Some candidates:
   - ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D.
   - ""CHOPD""? Not a word.
   - ""CHOPS"": C, H, O, P, S -> valid word? Yes.

   ""CHOPS"": meaning to cut. So ""CHOPS"" is acceptable.

   Another: ""CLOMP""? Not common, but valid? However, not as common as ""CHOPS"".

   ""COVER"": but contains E -> E is disallowed.

   ""QUA?"" -> not starting with C.

   ""C"" and then try to get information about vowels? We know the word doesn't have A or E, so vowels must be O, I, U? Or none? But most English words have vowels.

   Alternatively, ""SPLIT"" -> doesn't start with C.

   We need words starting with C.

   Let me think of common words: 
      ""COULD"" -> uses O, U, L, D -> but U and O?
      ""COAST"" -> but has A -> disallowed? A is excluded.

   ""COAST"" contains A -> so we cannot use A. Hence invalid.

   ""CHART"" -> contains A -> disallowed.

   ""CUT"" -> too short.

   ""CUBIC""? That has two C's? But we already know the first letter is C. The word might have another C? Our feedback for first guess didn't say anything about duplicate C? But we didn't have a duplicate. Now, it's possible? Yes.

   However, to maximize new letters, we might avoid repeating C? But since we only have one C so far? But we don't know if there are duplicates.

   Let me choose a word that avoids duplication and avoids the disallowed letters.

   Words: 
      ""COMBS"" -> C, O, M, B, S -> unique letters? Yes? But ""COMBS"" is a word? Yes (noun meaning the bees' home or verb meaning to groom hair?).

   ""COMET"" -> but E is disallowed.

   ""COMIC"" -> but repeated C? We know position 1 is C, so we would put C at position 1 again? Then the word starts with C. The other C? At position 4? We don't know if that would be correct. But also it has I.

   Let me consider: 
   Criteria: We want to test vowels? Since we've eliminated E and A, we could try O and I? Or U?

   ""COINS"" -> O and I? But contains I, O, N? Wait: does ""COINS"" contain N? COINS: C, O, I, N, S -> but N is disallowed? We know N is not in the word.

   Therefore, we must avoid N.

   So ""COINS"" is invalid because of N.

   ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S -> all new? And no A, E, N, R? Yes.

   Let's try ""CHOPS"": 
      If the word is ""CHOPS"" itself? Then we win? But we don't know yet.

   If not, we can get feedback on H, O, P, S.

   Alternatively, ""CLOUD"" -> C, L, O, U, D -> also good? But U is less common.

   Let me prioritize letters that are more common. Without E, A, R, N, what are the next common? 
   After E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S -> but R, A, N are out -> then common: I, O, T, S.

   So I, O, T, S are good.

   Now, we have positions 2-5: unknown.

   We are trying: 
      Option 1: ""CHOPS"": uses H, O, P, S -> note: H is not among the top? Well, H is common. 
      Option 2: ""COSTS"" -> but repeated S? Not ideal.

   ""COILS"": C, O, I, L, S -> avoids E, A, R, N? Yes. And uses O, I, L, S? L is common.

   So ""COILS"" is a word? Yes, meaning wires wound in a spiral.

   Let me compare ""CHOPS"" and ""COILS"". Both are valid.

   Which one covers more frequent letters?

   Among O, I: O and I are vowel-like. Then L vs H? L is more common than H? 
   Letter frequency: 
        O: 4th? (without E,A,R) -> actually in English, E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S are top. We have R,A,N,E out? So top remaining: I, O, T, S.

   ""CHOPS"": H, O, P, S -> O and S are very common. P is somewhat common? 
   ""COILS"": O, I, L, S -> I, O, S are common? L is also common? Actually L is 12th overall? 

   Both include O and S.

   Now, we want to avoid the possibility that we run into duplicates? 

   Since we don't know if the word has duplicates? We are free to use duplicates? However, for maximum information, unique letters are better.

   Both are unique? 
      ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S: unique? C is at start? We are introducing H,O,P,S -> all distinct? Yes.
      ""COILS"" -> C, O, I, L, S: distinct? Yes.

   ""COILS"" introduces I and L? Which I haven't tried? And O and S. While ""CHOPS"" introduces H and P? 

   But H and P are less common than I and L? Because I is a vowel and more common? 

   According to letter frequency in English:
      I: about 6.9% 
      O: 7.5%
      L: 4%
      S: 6.3%
      H: 6%
      P: 1.9%

   So ""COILS"" has I (6.9%), O (7.5%), L (4%), S (6.3%)? Total? But we don't count the fixed C? Actually, we are only concerned about the new positions? 

   Overall, ""COILS"" provides letters: O (common), I (common), L (medium), S (common). 
   ""CHOPS"" provides: H (about 6%), O (common), P (less common), S (common).

   Therefore, I think ""COILS"" covers more of the common remaining letters? Because H (6%) vs I (almost 7%)? And P is 1.9% vs L at 4%. 

   So ""COILS"" might be slightly better? Especially because L is more common than P.

   Moreover, we are testing two vowels? The word must have vowels? Since we know E and A are out? So O and I are good candidates.

   Therefore, I choose ""COILS"".

   Second guess: ""coils""

   So the guessed word: <guess>coils</guess><reasoning>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The letter ""C"" is correct and in position 1 (marked ✓).
- The letters ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word (marked x).

Key implications:
1. The correct word starts with ""C"".
2. The word contains none of these letters: R, A, N, E.
3. We need to probe remaining letters to identify possibilities.

For the second guess:
- Must start with ""C"" to preserve the known position-1 letter.
- Avoid using R, A, N, E.
- Use common English letters not yet tested to maximize information gain.
- Prioritize unique letters with high frequency (since duplicates reduce information).

Optimal strategy:
- Focus on common remaining consonants (like L, S, T, H) and vowels (O, I, U).
- Avoid reusing eliminated letters.

Selected word: **""COILS""**
- Starts with ""C"" as required.
- Uses new letters: O, I, L, S (all untested and high frequency).
- Avoids disallowed letters (no R, A, N, E).
- Maximizes information potential: Covers two vowels (O, I) and two common consonants (L, S).
</reasoning>

<guess>coils</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: coils -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""coils"" -> Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1 (as we already knew).
  - O is absent (so the word does not contain O).
  - I is correct and in position 3? Let's see: 
        Position: 1:C, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:S
    So I is in position 3 and correct (✓).
  - L is correct and in position 4 (since it's the 4th letter and marked ✓).
  - S is absent.

So now we know:
- The word starts with C (position 1).
- Position 3 is I.
- Position 4 is L.
- The word does not contain: R, A, N, E, O, S. (from the x's in both guesses)
- The word does contain I and L, but we already have their positions.

Also, note that in ""coils"", the O and S were absent, so we add O and S to the absent letters.

Current known:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: ? (unknown, but cannot be O, R, A, N, E, S)
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: ? (unknown, but cannot be O, R, A, N, E, S)

We also know the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Now, what letters are possible for position 2 and 5?
We have eliminated: R, A, N, E, O, S.

So the available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we have I and L in the word, but they are already placed. So we don't need to test them again? Actually, we don't know if they appear again? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? However, in the feedback for ""coils"", we had I and L marked correct, but if there were duplicates, we might not know? But in Wordle, if a letter appears only once and you use it twice, one might be marked as absent? But in this case, we didn't use duplicates.

But we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we don't have any indication so far.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits:
  C _ I L _

And the missing letters (position 2 and 5) must be from the available set.

We also want to maximize information? But we have two positions to fill. We might be able to guess the word? Or we can try to test more letters.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess? We have 6 tries total, so we have 4 left? But we might get it.

Let's think of possible words that fit the pattern: C _ I L _

With the constraints on the missing letters.

Possible letters for position 2: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Position 5: same set? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

Common words that fit:
  ""CHILL"": C H I L L -> but we have L at position 4 and then L at position 5? So duplicate L? And we know L is in position 4, so if we put L at position 5, it might be correct? But we don't know if L is duplicated? Also, in our second guess, we had L at position 4 and it was correct, but we didn't have L at position 5? So if the word has two L's, then in ""coils"" we only had one L? Then the feedback for the L in position 4 would be correct, but we wouldn't know about the other L? Actually, in Wordle, if the word has two L's and you guess one L in the correct position and no other L, then the feedback would only show one L as correct? But if you guess a word with one L and the word has two, then the feedback might not indicate the missing one? Actually, the feedback only tells you about the letters you guessed? So if the word has two L's and you only guess one, then you won't know about the second one? 

But in this case, we are trying to guess the word. We have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, without evidence, we might assume no duplicates? But we can't.

But let's list possible words:

  ""CHILL"": C H I L L -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L -> but we have position 4 as L, and then position 5 as L? But we don't know if L is duplicated? Also, H is allowed? And we haven't tested H? But in the second guess, we didn't use H? So H is a possibility.

  ""CHILD"": C H I L D -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D -> this is a valid word? Yes.

  ""CIVIL"": C I V I L -> but wait, position 3 is I? But in ""CIVIL"", position 2 is I? Then position 3 is V? But we have position 3 fixed as I? So ""CIVIL"" would be: C (1), I (2), V (3), I (4), L (5) -> but we need position 3 to be I? In ""CIVIL"", position 3 is V, not I? So it doesn't fit? Because we have position 3 fixed as I? So ""CIVIL"" is not matching.

  ""BUILD""? Doesn't start with C.

  ""CLIMB"": C L I M B -> but we have position 4 as L? In ""CLIMB"": position 1:C, 2:L, 3:I, 4:M, 5:B -> but we need position 4 to be L? So it doesn't match.

  We need position 3 to be I and position 4 to be L? So the pattern is: C (letter2) I L (letter5)

  Other words:
    ""CHILI""? But that's 5 letters? C-H-I-L-I -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:I -> so it fits? But we have two I's? And we know I is in position 3? Then position 5 is I? So that's possible? But we haven't tested I in position 5? And we don't know if I can be duplicated? Also, in the second guess, we had I only at position 3? So if the word has two I's, we wouldn't know? 

  ""CHILL"" and ""CHILI"" and ""CHILD"" are candidates.

  Also, ""CIVIL"" doesn't fit because position 3 is V, not I? But we have position 3 fixed as I.

  ""TRAIL""? But T and R? R is excluded? And doesn't start with C.

  ""FLAIL""? Doesn't start with C and has A? A is excluded.

  ""QUAIL""? Same.

  So let's list possible words that start with C, have I at position 3, L at position 4, and the second letter and fifth letter from the allowed set.

  For position 2: we have many options: H, T, U, V, W, etc.

  Common words:
    - CHILL
    - CHILD
    - CHILI
    - CRILL? Not a word.
    - CVILL? Not a word.

  Also, ""CECIL""? But C is at position 1 and then E? But E is excluded? So no.

  ""COLIC""? But O is excluded? And we have position 3 as I? ""COLIC"": C O L I C -> but position 3 is L? Not I? So doesn't fit.

  ""CUBIC""? C U B I C -> but position 3 is B? Not I? So no.

  ""CIVIC""? C I V I C -> position 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:C -> but we need position 3 to be I? It's V? So no.

  So the main candidates are: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI.

  Also, ""CHIRL""? Not a word.

  ""CHIRP""? But then position 4 would be R? But we need L at position 4? And R is excluded? So no.

  ""CHIRL"" not a word.

  ""CHIRM""? Not common? And position 4 would be R? No.

  So we have:
    CHILL: C H I L L
    CHILD: C H I L D
    CHILI: C H I L I

  Also, ""CHIEL""? But E is excluded? And position 5 is L? But we have position 4 as L? So ""CHIEL"" would be C H I E L -> but E is excluded? And position 4 is E? But we need L at position 4? So no.

  ""CHIRK""? But R is excluded? And position 4 would be R? No.

  ""CHIRT""? Same.

  ""CHIVE""? But E is excluded? And position 5 is E? No.

  ""CHIMP""? But position 4 would be M? Not L? So no.

  So the only common words I can think of are: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI.

  Now, we have to choose one? But we don't know which one? We have to test.

  We can try to guess one of them? But if we guess wrong, we get feedback and then we can guess again? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can try.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions to fill? And we know the pattern? So we might as well guess one of the candidates? But which one?

  But note: we haven't tested the letter H? In the second guess we didn't use H? So we don't know if H is in the word? But in the pattern, position 2 is H in all these candidates? So if we guess a word that doesn't have H? But we don't have any candidate without H? So we must test H? Actually, if we guess one of these, we will find out about H? Because if the word is CHILL, then H is present? But if we guess CHILL and the word is CHILD, then we get feedback that H is correct? But we already know that? Because we are putting H in position 2? And if it's correct, then we get H(✓) and then we know? But we also get the last letter? 

  However, we have three candidates: 
      CHILL: last letter L -> but we already know L is in the word? But if we guess CHILL, then the last letter L? We don't know if it's correct? But we know position 4 is L? So if we put L at position 5, it might be correct? Or not? 

  But in the feedback for ""coils"", we had L at position 4 correct? But we don't know if there is another L? So if we guess CHILL, and the word is CHILL, then we get all correct? If the word is CHILD, then we get: 
        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(?) -> but the last letter is L? But the word is CHILD, so last letter is D? So the last L would be absent? And we get feedback: L at position 5 is absent? Then we know it's not CHILL? Then we can guess CHILD? 

  Similarly, if we guess CHILD and the word is CHILL, then we get: 
        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> then we know the last letter is not D? Then we can guess CHILL? 

  But we have only two positions to fill? And we are testing the last letter? 

  Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't have H? But then we can test if H is present? But we don't have a candidate without H? So we must test H? 

  But note: we can also test multiple letters? For example, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a different last letter? But we don't know the last letter? 

  However, we have three candidates? We can try to guess a word that is not one of the candidates? But that might not be efficient? 

  Let me think: we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, or I? But we don't know? 

  But we want to maximize information? We have two unknowns: 
      - Is H in the word? (but in the pattern, position 2 must be H? because all candidates have H? So if we don't put H, then we might not get the word? But we don't know if H is the only possibility? 

  Actually, are there other words? For example, ""CVILL"" is not a word? ""CWHIL""? Not a word? ""CZHIL""? No? 

  What about ""CABIL""? But A is excluded? 

  ""CEDIL""? E excluded? 

  ""CFILM""? Not a word? 

  ""CHIRL""? Not a word? 

  So it seems the only common words are CHILL, CHILD, CHILI? 

  But wait, ""CHILI"" has two I's? So if we guess ""CHILI"", then we have I at position 3 and 5? 

  Now, we haven't tested for duplicate I? In the second guess, we had I at position 3? And we don't know if there is another I? 

  So the candidates are:
      CHILL: C H I L L
      CHILD: C H I L D
      CHILI: C H I L I

  We can try to guess one of them? 

  But we have 4 guesses? So we can try one? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the last letter? But we don't have a word that covers multiple? 

  But note: we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, or I? But that might not be a word? 

  For example, ""CHIRP""? But R is excluded? 

  ""CHINK""? But N is excluded? 

  ""CHIMP""? But M? And position 4 would be M? But we need L at position 4? So we cannot change position 4? 

  We have to keep position 3 as I and position 4 as L? 

  So we are forced to have the pattern: C H I L ? 

  And the last letter must be one of: L, D, I? (from the candidates) but also other possibilities? But we don't have other common words? 

  What about ""CHIEL""? But E excluded? 

  ""CHIRL""? Not a word? 

  ""CHIZZ""? Not a word? 

  ""CHIVY""? But V? And E? Excluded? 

  So I think the only common words are the three: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI. 

  Now, we can try to guess ""CHILL"" first? 

  If it's correct, we win? 

  If not, we get feedback: 
      If the word is CHILD: 
          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(x) -> because the last letter is D, not L? 
      Then we know the last letter is not L? So we can try CHILD? 

      If the word is CHILI: 
          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(?) -> but the last letter of CHILI is I? So we have L at position 5? But the word has I at position 5? So L would be absent? Then we get: L(x) at position 5? Then we know it's not CHILL? Then we can try CHILI? 

  But wait, if we guess CHILL and the word is CHILI, we get:
        Position 1: C ✓
        Position 2: H ✓ (if H is correct? But in CHILI, position 2 is H? So H is correct? 
        Position 3: I ✓
        Position 4: L ✓
        Position 5: L -> but the word has I at position 5? So L is not present? Because the word CHILI has only one L? At position 4? So the L at position 5 is absent? So we get: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(x)

  Then we know the last letter is not L? So we can try CHILD? But if we try CHILD and the word is CHILI, then we get:
        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> because last letter is I, not D? 
        Then we know it's not CHILD? Then we try CHILI? 

  So we might need two more guesses? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the last letter without committing to H? But we don't have a word? 

  Or we can try a word that has a different second letter? But we don't know any other second letter? 

  But wait, is it possible that the second letter is not H? We assumed it must be H? But are there other words? 

  Let me double-check: 
      Pattern: C _ I L _ 
      With the missing letters not in {R, A, N, E, O, S}

  Other words? 
      ""CUTIN""? But position 4 is I? Not L? 
      ""CIVIL"" we already saw doesn't fit? 
      ""CLIFT""? But position 2 is L? Then position 3 is I? Position 4 is F? Not L? 
      ""CLINT""? But N is excluded? 
      ""CLIPT""? Not a word? 
      ""CULCH""? But position 3 is L? Not I? 
      ""CULTI""? C U L T I -> position 3 is L? Not I? 
      ""CURIO""? But O is excluded? 
      ""CURVY""? But position 3 is R? Excluded? 
      ""CWTCH""? Not a word? 
      ""CYCLO""? O excluded? 

  What about ""CHIRP""? Not? 

  ""CHIPS""? But S is excluded? And position 4 is P? Not L? 

  So I think H is the only possibility for position 2? 

  Therefore, we must have H at position 2? 

  Then the word is C H I L ? 

  And the last letter must be one of: L, D, I? 

  Now, we can try to guess ""CHILD"" because it has a different last letter? 

  But we don't know? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, I? But that would not be a candidate? And we might waste a guess? 

  But we can try to test multiple letters? For example, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then in the last position, we put a letter that is common? But we don't know? 

  However, we have only three candidates? So we can try one? 

  Let me choose ""CHILD"" as the guess? Because it has a D? And we haven't tested D? 

  If we guess ""CHILD"": 
      If the word is CHILD: we win? 
      If the word is CHILL: we get feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> then we know the last letter is not D? So we try CHILL? 
      If the word is CHILI: we get feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> same as above? Then we know it's not D? Then we try CHILI? 

  But wait, if we get D(x) for both CHILL and CHILI? Then we don't know which one? Because both CHILL and CHILI have last letter not D? So we would have to try both? 

  Actually, if we guess ""CHILD"" and the word is CHILL, we get D(x) and then we know the last letter is not D? Then we try CHILL? 
  If we guess ""CHILD"" and the word is CHILI, we get D(x) and then we try CHILI? 

  But we don't know which one? So we might need to try both? 

  Alternatively, we can try ""CHILI"": 
      If the word is CHILI: win? 
      If the word is CHILL: we get last letter L? But wait, in ""CHILI"", we have I at position 5? But the word CHILL has L at position 5? So we get: 
          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) I(?) -> for CHILL, the last letter is L? So the I at position 5 is absent? Because CHILL has only one I? At position 3? So we get I(x) at position 5? 
      Then we know the last letter is not I? So we try CHILL? 
      If the word is CHILD: we get I(x) at position 5? Then we know the last letter is not I? So we try CHILD? 

  But again, we don't know which one? 

  So in either case, if we guess one candidate and it's wrong, we get the last letter wrong? And then we know to try the other two? But we have two left? Then we can try one of the remaining two? 

  Since we have 4 guesses left? We can do: 
      Guess 3: CHILD 
      If correct, done.
      If not, then we get feedback: 
          If the word is CHILL: we get D(x) -> then we know to try CHILL next? 
          If the word is CHILI: we get D(x) -> then we know to try CHILI next? 
      Then guess 4: either CHILL or CHILI? But we don't know which one? 

  But we don't know which one? So we have to choose arbitrarily? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that is not a candidate? But that tests the last letter? 

  For example, we can try a word that has the same pattern but with a different last letter? But we don't know? 

  But we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, I? But that might not be a word? 

  For example, ""CHIRP"" is not allowed? 

  ""CHIMB""? Not a word? 

  ""CHIMP""? But then position 4 would be M? But we have to keep position 4 as L? 

  We cannot change position 4? 

  So we are stuck? 

  Another idea: we can try a word that has the same pattern but with a letter that we haven't used? For example, ""CHIML""? Not a word? 

  Or ""CHUGL""? Not a word? 

  So I think we have to guess one of the candidates? 

  Let me choose ""CHILD"" as the third guess? 

  If it's correct, we win? 

  If not, we get feedback that the last letter is not D? Then we have two options: CHILL and CHILI? 

  Then we can try ""CHILL"" next? If it's not, then it must be ""CHILI""? 

  But we have 4 guesses? So we can do that? 

  Alternatively, we can try to test for duplicate I? But how? 

  We can try a word that has I at position 5? But we don't have a word that has I at position 5 and H at position 2? But ""CHILI"" does? But that's a candidate? 

  Or we can try a word that has I at a different position? But we don't know? 

  For example, we can try ""DUTCH""? But doesn't start with C? 

  ""PITCH""? But position 1 is P? 

  We need to start with C? 

  ""C"" and then a word that has I at position 5? But we have position 3 fixed as I? So if we put I at position 5, then we have two I's? 

  For example, ""CUBIC""? But position 3 is B? Not I? 

  ""CIVIC""? But position 3 is V? 

  ""CONIC""? O excluded? 

  ""CYNIC""? But position 3 is N? Excluded? 

  ""CURVY""? Not? 

  So I think it's not easy to test for duplicate I? 

  Therefore, I will go with ""CHILD"" as the third guess? 

  But let's see the feedback we have: we know position 1,3,4 are fixed? And position 2 must be H? And position 5 is unknown? 

  So I'll guess ""CHILD"". 

  But note: in the feedback for ""coils"", we had S absent? But in ""CHILD"", there is no S? So that's fine? 

  So guess: ""child""

  But wait, we have to output in the format.

  Alternatively, we can try to think of a word that tests more letters? But we have only two positions? And one of them we are confident is H? 

  So I think it's acceptable to guess ""CHILD"". 

  If we are wrong, we get information about the last letter? 

  So let's do that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  - **C** is correct and in position 1.  
  - **R, A, N, E** are absent from the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""coils"" → Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)**  
  - **C** is correct (position 1, already known).  
  - **O** is absent.  
  - **I** is correct and in position 3.  
  - **L** is correct and in position 4.  
  - **S** is absent.  

### Key Insights
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **C**  
   - Position 3: **I**  
   - Position 4: **L**  
   - The word structure is: **C _ I L _** (only positions 2 and 5 are unknown).  

2. **Absent letters**:  
   - **R, A, N, E, O, S** cannot appear anywhere in the word.  

3. **Possible letters for positions 2 and 5**:  
   - Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   - Available vowels (since E, A, O are out): I, U (but I is already used at position 3; duplicates are possible).  

4. **Candidate words**:  
   - After eliminating invalid letters, common English words fitting **C _ I L _** are:  
     - **CHILL** (C H I L L)  
     - **CHILD** (C H I L D)  
     - **CHILI** (C H I L I)  
   - All candidates share **H** in position 2.  

### Strategy for Guess 3
- **Goal**: Test the variable position 5 (last letter) while confirming **H** in position 2.  
- **Why ""child""?**  
  - It tests **H** in position 2 (common to all candidates).  
  - It tests **D** in position 5 (which, if absent, eliminates **CHILD** and narrows to **CHILL** or **CHILI**).  
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle. If not, feedback on **D** will reduce possibilities for the next guess.  
- **Risk**: If **D** is absent, we still have 3 guesses left to distinguish between **CHILL** and **CHILI**.  

### Next Steps
- If **D** is correct (✓), the word is **CHILD**.  
- If **D** is absent (x), the word is either **CHILL** or **CHILI** (guess **CHILL** next).

Starts with C (since position 1 is fixed as C).\n 2. Uses new letters that we haven\'t tried yet to maximize information.\n\n Avoid using any of the disallowed letters: R, A, N, E.\n\n Available letters: We can use letters from the rest of the alphabet excluding R,A,N,E.\n\n We also want to cover common letters. Common consonants might be T, L, S, etc., and vowels might be I, O, U (since E,A are out).\n\n Let me try to think of a word that starts with C and has other common letters.\n\n Some possibilities: \n - Could try words like ""C"" + a combination of T, L, S, H, O, I, U, etc.\n\n Examples: \n   ""CHILL"", but we have 5 letters and ""CHILL"" is 5 letters? Let\'s check: C-H-I-L-L -> but it has L repeated? Actually, ""CHILL"" is C-H-I-L-L, so yes. However, repeated L might not be ideal for information.\n   ""CLIMB"" -> C, L, I, M, B -> only unique letters? Yes.\n\n Let me list some words:\n   ""COULD"" -> contains O, U, L, D -> but O and U are vowels? Actually, we don\'t know about vowels yet except that A and E are not present.\n   ""C"" followed by other popular letters: T, L, S, H, O, I, U, etc.\n\n We have already eliminated 4 letters: R, A, N, E. So we have 22 letters left.\n\n Since we need to maximize information, we should try to include letters that are frequent in 5-letter words.\n\n According to English letter frequency, after the top letters we\'ve excluded, we have: \n   E (excluded), A (excluded), then common ones: T, O, I, S, H, etc.\n\n But without E and A, we have T, O, I, S, H, R (but R is excluded) -> R is excluded? Yes, in our feedback R was x, meaning absent.\n\n So possible words: \n   ""COST"" is only 4 letters, so no.\n   ""CLOUD"" -> C L O U D -> contains O and U (vowels) and L, D. This might be good because it introduces new vowels and consonants.\n\n   ""CHIST""? That\'s not a word. \n   ""CHISL""? Not a word.\n\n   ""COULY""? Not a common word.\n\n   ""COILS"" -> C, O, I, L, S: all unique and new? But we don\'t know about S. Also, we haven\'t tried S, O, I, L.\n\n   ""CIVIL"" -> C, I, V, I, L -> but repeated I? Actually, \'I\' appears twice? Spelling ""civil"" has two I\'s? Position 2 and 4? Actually, word: C-I-V-I-L -> that\'s one I? Wait: C-I-V-I-L? No, it\'s C-I-V-I-L? Actually, it has two I\'s. Positions: 2 and 4. So repeated letter? Not ideal.\n\n   ""CHOMP"" -> C, H, O, M, P. All unique? Yes.\n\n   ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S. This might be good? But note we have S.\n\n   ""CURLY"" -> but contains R -> disallowed? We cannot use R.\n\n   Let me think: avoid R,A,N,E.\n\n   Some candidates:\n   - ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D.\n   - ""CHOPD""? Not a word.\n   - ""CHOPS"": C, H, O, P, S -> valid word? Yes.\n\n   ""CHOPS"": meaning to cut. So ""CHOPS"" is acceptable.\n\n   Another: ""CLOMP""? Not common, but valid? However, not as common as ""CHOPS"".\n\n   ""COVER"": but contains E -> E is disallowed.\n\n   ""QUA?"" -> not starting with C.\n\n   ""C"" and then try to get information about vowels? We know the word doesn\'t have A or E, so vowels must be O, I, U? Or none? But most English words have vowels.\n\n   Alternatively, ""SPLIT"" -> doesn\'t start with C.\n\n   We need words starting with C.\n\n   Let me think of common words: \n      ""COULD"" -> uses O, U, L, D -> but U and O?\n      ""COAST"" -> but has A -> disallowed? A is excluded.\n\n   ""COAST"" contains A -> so we cannot use A. Hence invalid.\n\n   ""CHART"" -> contains A -> disallowed.\n\n   ""CUT"" -> too short.\n\n   ""CUBIC""? That has two C\'s? But we already know the first letter is C. The word might have another C? Our feedback for first guess didn\'t say anything about duplicate C? But we didn\'t have a duplicate. Now, it\'s possible? Yes.\n\n   However, to maximize new letters, we might avoid repeating C? But since we only have one C so far? But we don\'t know if there are duplicates.\n\n   Let me choose a word that avoids duplication and avoids the disallowed letters.\n\n   Words: \n      ""COMBS"" -> C, O, M, B, S -> unique letters? Yes? But ""COMBS"" is a word? Yes (noun meaning the bees\' home or verb meaning to groom hair?).\n\n   ""COMET"" -> but E is disallowed.\n\n   ""COMIC"" -> but repeated C? We know position 1 is C, so we would put C at position 1 again? Then the word starts with C. The other C? At position 4? We don\'t know if that would be correct. But also it has I.\n\n   Let me consider: \n   Criteria: We want to test vowels? Since we\'ve eliminated E and A, we could try O and I? Or U?\n\n   ""COINS"" -> O and I? But contains I, O, N? Wait: does ""COINS"" contain N? COINS: C, O, I, N, S -> but N is disallowed? We know N is not in the word.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid N.\n\n   So ""COINS"" is invalid because of N.\n\n   ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S -> all new? And no A, E, N, R? Yes.\n\n   Let\'s try ""CHOPS"": \n      If the word is ""CHOPS"" itself? Then we win? But we don\'t know yet.\n\n   If not, we can get feedback on H, O, P, S.\n\n   Alternatively, ""CLOUD"" -> C, L, O, U, D -> also good? But U is less common.\n\n   Let me prioritize letters that are more common. Without E, A, R, N, what are the next common? \n   After E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S -> but R, A, N are out -> then common: I, O, T, S.\n\n   So I, O, T, S are good.\n\n   Now, we have positions 2-5: unknown.\n\n   We are trying: \n      Option 1: ""CHOPS"": uses H, O, P, S -> note: H is not among the top? Well, H is common. \n      Option 2: ""COSTS"" -> but repeated S? Not ideal.\n\n   ""COILS"": C, O, I, L, S -> avoids E, A, R, N? Yes. And uses O, I, L, S? L is common.\n\n   So ""COILS"" is a word? Yes, meaning wires wound in a spiral.\n\n   Let me compare ""CHOPS"" and ""COILS"". Both are valid.\n\n   Which one covers more frequent letters?\n\n   Among O, I: O and I are vowel-like. Then L vs H? L is more common than H? \n   Letter frequency: \n        O: 4th? (without E,A,R) -> actually in English, E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S are top. We have R,A,N,E out? So top remaining: I, O, T, S.\n\n   ""CHOPS"": H, O, P, S -> O and S are very common. P is somewhat common? \n   ""COILS"": O, I, L, S -> I, O, S are common? L is also common? Actually L is 12th overall? \n\n   Both include O and S.\n\n   Now, we want to avoid the possibility that we run into duplicates? \n\n   Since we don\'t know if the word has duplicates? We are free to use duplicates? However, for maximum information, unique letters are better.\n\n   Both are unique? \n      ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S: unique? C is at start? We are introducing H,O,P,S -> all distinct? Yes.\n      ""COILS"" -> C, O, I, L, S: distinct? Yes.\n\n   ""COILS"" introduces I and L? Which I haven\'t tried? And O and S. While ""CHOPS"" introduces H and P? \n\n   But H and P are less common than I and L? Because I is a vowel and more common? \n\n   According to letter frequency in English:\n      I: about 6.9% \n      O: 7.5%\n      L: 4%\n      S: 6.3%\n      H: 6%\n      P: 1.9%\n\n   So ""COILS"" has I (6.9%), O (7.5%), L (4%), S (6.3%)? Total? But we don\'t count the fixed C? Actually, we are only concerned about the new positions? \n\n   Overall, ""COILS"" provides letters: O (common), I (common), L (medium), S (common). \n   ""CHOPS"" provides: H (about 6%), O (common), P (less common), S (common).\n\n   Therefore, I think ""COILS"" covers more of the common remaining letters? Because H (6%) vs I (almost 7%)? And P is 1.9% vs L at 4%. \n\n   So ""COILS"" might be slightly better? Especially because L is more common than P.\n\n   Moreover, we are testing two vowels? The word must have vowels? Since we know E and A are out? So O and I are good candidates.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""COILS"".\n\n   Second guess: ""coils""\n\n   So the guessed word: <guess>coils</guess><reasoning>\nBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- The letter ""C"" is correct and in position 1 (marked ✓).\n- The letters ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word (marked x).\n\nKey implications:\n1. The correct word starts with ""C"".\n2. The word contains none of these letters: R, A, N, E.\n3. We need to probe remaining letters to identify possibilities.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must start with ""C"" to preserve the known position-1 letter.\n- Avoid using R, A, N, E.\n- Use common English letters not yet tested to maximize information gain.\n- Prioritize unique letters with high frequency (since duplicates reduce information).\n\nOptimal strategy:\n- Focus on common remaining consonants (like L, S, T, H) and vowels (O, I, U).\n- Avoid reusing eliminated letters.\n\nSelected word: **""COILS""**\n- Starts with ""C"" as required.\n- Uses new letters: O, I, L, S (all untested and high frequency).\n- Avoids disallowed letters (no R, A, N, E).\n- Maximizes information potential: Covers two vowels (O, I) and two common consonants (L, S).\n</reasoning>\n\n<guess>coils</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: coils -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n  - C is correct and in position 1.\n  - R, A, N, E are absent.\n\nGuess 2: ""coils"" -> Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)\n  - C is correct and in position 1 (as we already knew).\n  - O is absent (so the word does not contain O).\n  - I is correct and in position 3?

But in Wordle, if a letter appears only once and you use it twice, one might be marked as absent? But in this case, we didn\'t use duplicates.\n\nBut we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we don\'t have any indication so far.\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that fits:\n  C _ I L _\n\nAnd the missing letters (position 2 and 5) must be from the available set.\n\nWe also want to maximize information?

We have 6 tries total, so we have 4 left? But we might get it.\n\nLet\'s think of possible words that fit the pattern: C _ I L _\n\nWith the constraints on the missing letters.\n\nPossible letters for position 2: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\nPosition 5: same set? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know.\n\nCommon words that fit:\n  ""CHILL"": C H I L L -> but we have L at position 4 and then L at position 5? So duplicate L? And we know L is in position 4, so if we put L at position 5, it might be correct? But we don\'t know if L is duplicated? Also, in our second guess, we had L at position 4 and it was correct, but we didn\'t have L at position 5? So if the word has two L\'s, then in ""coils"" we only had one L? Then the feedback for the L in position 4 would be correct, but we wouldn\'t know about the other L? Actually, in Wordle, if the word has two L\'s and you guess one L in the correct position and no other L, then the feedback would only show one L as correct? But if you guess a word with one L and the word has two, then the feedback might not indicate the missing one? Actually, the feedback only tells you about the letters you guessed? So if the word has two L\'s and you only guess one, then you won\'t know about the second one? \n\nBut in this case, we are trying to guess the word. We have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, without evidence, we might assume no duplicates? But we can\'t.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words:\n\n  ""CHILL"": C H I L L -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L -> but we have position 4 as L, and then position 5 as L? But we don\'t know if L is duplicated? Also, H is allowed? And we haven\'t tested H? But in the second guess, we didn\'t use H? So H is a possibility.\n\n  ""CHILD"": C H I L D -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D -> this is a valid word? Yes.\n\n  ""CIVIL"": C I V I L -> but wait, position 3 is I? But in ""CIVIL"", position 2 is I? Then position 3 is V? But we have position 3 fixed as I? So ""CIVIL"" would be: C (1), I (2), V (3), I (4), L (5) -> but we need position 3 to be I? In ""CIVIL"", position 3 is V, not I? So it doesn\'t fit? Because we have position 3 fixed as I? So ""CIVIL"" is not matching.\n\n  ""BUILD""? Doesn\'t start with C.\n\n  ""CLIMB"": C L I M B -> but we have position 4 as L? In ""CLIMB"": position 1:C, 2:L, 3:I, 4:M, 5:B -> but we need position 4 to be L? So it doesn\'t match.\n\n  We need position 3 to be I and position 4 to be L? So the pattern is: C (letter2) I L (letter5)\n\n  Other words:\n    ""CHILI""? But that\'s 5 letters? C-H-I-L-I -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:I -> so it fits? But we have two I\'s? And we know I is in position 3? Then position 5 is I? So that\'s possible? But we haven\'t tested I in position 5? And we don\'t know if I can be duplicated? Also, in the second guess, we had I only at position 3? So if the word has two I\'s, we wouldn\'t know? \n\n  ""CHILL"" and ""CHILI"" and ""CHILD"" are candidates.\n\n  Also, ""CIVIL"" doesn\'t fit because position 3 is V, not I? But we have position 3 fixed as I.\n\n  ""TRAIL""? But T and R? R is excluded? And doesn\'t start with C.\n\n  ""FLAIL""? Doesn\'t start with C and has A? A is excluded.\n\n  ""QUAIL""? Same.\n\n  So let\'s list possible words that start with C, have I at position 3, L at position 4, and the second letter and fifth letter from the allowed set.\n\n  For position 2: we have many options: H, T, U, V, W, etc.\n\n  Common words:\n    - CHILL\n    - CHILD\n    - CHILI\n    - CRILL? Not a word.\n    - CVILL? Not a word.\n\n  Also, ""CECIL""? But C is at position 1 and then E? But E is excluded? So no.\n\n  ""COLIC""? But O is excluded? And we have position 3 as I? ""COLIC"": C O L I C -> but position 3 is L? Not I? So doesn\'t fit.\n\n  ""CUBIC""? C U B I C -> but position 3 is B? Not I? So no.\n\n  ""CIVIC""? C I V I C -> position 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:C -> but we need position 3 to be I? It\'s V? So no.\n\n  So the main candidates are: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI.\n\n  Also, ""CHIRL""? Not a word.\n\n  ""CHIRP""? But then position 4 would be R? But we need L at position 4? And R is excluded? So no.\n\n  ""CHIRL"" not a word.\n\n  ""CHIRM""? Not common? And position 4 would be R? No.\n\n  So we have:\n    CHILL: C H I L L\n    CHILD: C H I L D\n    CHILI: C H I L I\n\n  Also, ""CHIEL""? But E is excluded? And position 5 is L? But we have position 4 as L? So ""CHIEL"" would be C H I E L -> but E is excluded? And position 4 is E? But we need L at position 4? So no.\n\n  ""CHIRK""? But R is excluded? And position 4 would be R? No.\n\n  ""CHIRT""? Same.\n\n  ""CHIVE""? But E is excluded? And position 5 is E? No.\n\n  ""CHIMP""? But position 4 would be M? Not L? So no.\n\n  So the only common words I can think of are: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI.\n\n  Now, we have to choose one? But we don\'t know which one? We have to test.\n\n  We can try to guess one of them? But if we guess wrong, we get feedback and then we can guess again? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can try.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions to fill? And we know the pattern? So we might as well guess one of the candidates? But which one?\n\n  But note: we haven\'t tested the letter H? In the second guess we didn\'t use H? So we don\'t know if H is in the word? But in the pattern, position 2 is H in all these candidates? So if we guess a word that doesn\'t have H? But we don\'t have any candidate without H? So we must test H? Actually, if we guess one of these, we will find out about H? Because if the word is CHILL, then H is present? But if we guess CHILL and the word is CHILD, then we get feedback that H is correct? But we already know that? Because we are putting H in position 2? And if it\'s correct, then we get H(✓) and then we know? But we also get the last letter? \n\n  However, we have three candidates: \n      CHILL: last letter L -> but we already know L is in the word? But if we guess CHILL, then the last letter L? We don\'t know if it\'s correct? But we know position 4 is L? So if we put L at position 5, it might be correct? Or not? \n\n  But in the feedback for ""coils"", we had L at position 4 correct? But we don\'t know if there is another L? So if we guess CHILL, and the word is CHILL, then we get all correct? If the word is CHILD, then we get: \n        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(?) -> but the last letter is L? But the word is CHILD, so last letter is D? So the last L would be absent? And we get feedback: L at position 5 is absent? Then we know it\'s not CHILL? Then we can guess CHILD? \n\n  Similarly, if we guess CHILD and the word is CHILL, then we get: \n        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> then we know the last letter is not D? Then we can guess CHILL? \n\n  But we have only two positions to fill? And we are testing the last letter? \n\n  Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn\'t have H? But then we can test if H is present? But we don\'t have a candidate without H? So we must test H? \n\n  But note: we can also test multiple letters? For example, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a different last letter? But we don\'t know the last letter? \n\n  However, we have three candidates? We can try to guess a word that is not one of the candidates? But that might not be efficient? \n\n  Let me think: we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, or I? But we don\'t know? \n\n  But we want to maximize information? We have two unknowns: \n      - Is H in the word? (but in the pattern, position 2 must be H? because all candidates have H? So if we don\'t put H, then we might not get the word? But we don\'t know if H is the only possibility? \n\n  Actually, are there other words? For example, ""CVILL"" is not a word? ""CWHIL""? Not a word? ""CZHIL""? No? \n\n  What about ""CABIL""? But A is excluded? \n\n  ""CEDIL""? E excluded? \n\n  ""CFILM""? Not a word? \n\n  ""CHIRL""? Not a word? \n\n  So it seems the only common words are CHILL, CHILD, CHILI? \n\n  But wait, ""CHILI"" has two I\'s? So if we guess ""CHILI"", then we have I at position 3 and 5? \n\n  Now, we haven\'t tested for duplicate I? In the second guess, we had I at position 3? And we don\'t know if there is another I? \n\n  So the candidates are:\n      CHILL: C H I L L\n      CHILD: C H I L D\n      CHILI: C H I L I\n\n  We can try to guess one of them? \n\n  But we have 4 guesses? So we can try one? \n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the last letter? But we don\'t have a word that covers multiple? \n\n  But note: we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, or I? But that might not be a word? \n\n  For example, ""CHIRP""? But R is excluded? \n\n  ""CHINK""? But N is excluded? \n\n  ""CHIMP""? But M? And position 4 would be M? But we need L at position 4? So we cannot change position 4? \n\n  We have to keep position 3 as I and position 4 as L? \n\n  So we are forced to have the pattern: C H I L ? \n\n  And the last letter must be one of: L, D, I? (from the candidates) but also other possibilities? But we don\'t have other common words? \n\n  What about ""CHIEL""? But E excluded? \n\n  ""CHIRL""? Not a word? \n\n  ""CHIZZ""? Not a word? \n\n  ""CHIVY""? But V? And E? Excluded? \n\n  So I think the only common words are the three: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI. \n\n  Now, we can try to guess ""CHILL"" first? \n\n  If it\'s correct, we win? \n\n  If not, we get feedback: \n      If the word is CHILD: \n          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(x) -> because the last letter is D, not L? \n      Then we know the last letter is not L? So we can try CHILD? \n\n      If the word is CHILI: \n          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(?) -> but the last letter of CHILI is I? So we have L at position 5? But the word has I at position 5? So L would be absent? Then we get: L(x) at position 5? Then we know it\'s not CHILL? Then we can try CHILI? \n\n  But wait, if we guess CHILL and the word is CHILI, we get:\n        Position 1: C ✓\n        Position 2: H ✓ (if H is correct? But in CHILI, position 2 is H? So H is correct? \n        Position 3: I ✓\n        Position 4: L ✓\n        Position 5: L -> but the word has I at position 5? So L is not present? Because the word CHILI has only one L? At position 4? So the L at position 5 is absent? So we get: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(x)\n\n  Then we know the last letter is not L? So we can try CHILD? But if we try CHILD and the word is CHILI, then we get:\n        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> because last letter is I, not D? \n        Then we know it\'s not CHILD? Then we try CHILI? \n\n  So we might need two more guesses? \n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the last letter without committing to H? But we don\'t have a word? \n\n  Or we can try a word that has a different second letter? But we don\'t know any other second letter? \n\n  But wait, is it possible that the second letter is not H? We assumed it must be H? But are there other words? \n\n  Let me double-check: \n      Pattern: C _ I L _ \n      With the missing letters not in {R, A, N, E, O, S}\n\n  Other words? \n      ""CUTIN""? But position 4 is I? Not L? \n      ""CIVIL"" we already saw doesn\'t fit? \n      ""CLIFT""? But position 2 is L? Then position 3 is I? Position 4 is F? Not L? \n      ""CLINT""? But N is excluded? \n      ""CLIPT""? Not a word? \n      ""CULCH""? But position 3 is L? Not I? \n      ""CULTI""? C U L T I -> position 3 is L? Not I? \n      ""CURIO""? But O is excluded? \n      ""CURVY""? But position 3 is R? Excluded? \n      ""CWTCH""? Not a word? \n      ""CYCLO""? O excluded? \n\n  What about ""CHIRP""? Not? \n\n  ""CHIPS""? But S is excluded? And position 4 is P? Not L? \n\n  So I think H is the only possibility for position 2? \n\n  Therefore, we must have H at position 2? \n\n  Then the word is C H I L ? \n\n  And the last letter must be one of: L, D, I? \n\n  Now, we can try to guess ""CHILD"" because it has a different last letter? \n\n  But we don\'t know? \n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, I? But that would not be a candidate? And we might waste a guess? \n\n  But we can try to test multiple letters? For example, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then in the last position, we put a letter that is common? But we don\'t know? \n\n  However, we have only three candidates? So we can try one? \n\n  Let me choose ""CHILD"" as the guess? Because it has a D? And we haven\'t tested D? \n\n  If we guess ""CHILD"": \n      If the word is CHILD: we win? \n      If the word is CHILL: we get feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> then we know the last letter is not D? So we try CHILL? \n      If the word is CHILI: we get feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> same as above? Then we know it\'s not D? Then we try CHILI? \n\n  But wait, if we get D(x) for both CHILL and CHILI? Then we don\'t know which one? Because both CHILL and CHILI have last letter not D? So we would have to try both? \n\n  Actually, if we guess ""CHILD"" and the word is CHILL, we get D(x) and then we know the last letter is not D? Then we try CHILL? \n  If we guess ""CHILD"" and the word is CHILI, we get D(x) and then we try CHILI? \n\n  But we don\'t know which one? So we might need to try both? \n\n  Alternatively, we can try ""CHILI"": \n      If the word is CHILI: win? \n      If the word is CHILL: we get last letter L? But wait, in ""CHILI"", we have I at position 5? But the word CHILL has L at position 5? So we get: \n          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) I(?) -> for CHILL, the last letter is L? So the I at position 5 is absent? Because CHILL has only one I? At position 3? So we get I(x) at position 5? \n      Then we know the last letter is not I? So we try CHILL? \n      If the word is CHILD: we get I(x) at position 5? Then we know the last letter is not I? So we try CHILD? \n\n  But again, we don\'t know which one? \n\n  So in either case, if we guess one candidate and it\'s wrong, we get the last letter wrong? And then we know to try the other two? But we have two left? Then we can try one of the remaining two? \n\n  Since we have 4 guesses left? We can do: \n      Guess 3: CHILD \n      If correct, done.\n      If not, then we get feedback: \n          If the word is CHILL: we get D(x) -> then we know to try CHILL next? \n          If the word is CHILI: we get D(x) -> then we know to try CHILI next? \n      Then guess 4: either CHILL or CHILI? But we don\'t know which one? \n\n  But we don\'t know which one? So we have to choose arbitrarily? \n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that is not a candidate? But that tests the last letter? \n\n  For example, we can try a word that has the same pattern but with a different last letter? But we don\'t know? \n\n  But we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, I? But that might not be a word? \n\n  For example, ""CHIRP"" is not allowed? \n\n  ""CHIMB""? Not a word? \n\n  ""CHIMP""? But then position 4 would be M? But we have to keep position 4 as L? \n\n  We cannot change position 4? \n\n  So we are stuck? \n\n  Another idea: we can try a word that has the same pattern but with a letter that we haven\'t used? For example, ""CHIML""? Not a word? \n\n  Or ""CHUGL""? Not a word? \n\n  So I think we have to guess one of the candidates? \n\n  Let me choose ""CHILD"" as the third guess? \n\n  If it\'s correct, we win? \n\n  If not, we get feedback that the last letter is not D? Then we have two options: CHILL and CHILI? \n\n  Then we can try ""CHILL"" next? If it\'s not, then it must be ""CHILI""? \n\n  But we have 4 guesses? So we can do that? \n\n  Alternatively, we can try to test for duplicate I? But how? \n\n  We can try a word that has I at position 5? But we don\'t have a word that has I at position 5 and H at position 2? But ""CHILI"" does? But that\'s a candidate? \n\n  Or we can try a word that has I at a different position? But we don\'t know? \n\n  For example, we can try ""DUTCH""? But doesn\'t start with C? \n\n  ""PITCH""? But position 1 is P? \n\n  We need to start with C? \n\n  ""C"" and then a word that has I at position 5? But we have position 3 fixed as I? So if we put I at position 5, then we have two I\'s? \n\n  For example, ""CUBIC""? But position 3 is B? Not I? \n\n  ""CIVIC""? But position 3 is V? \n\n  ""CONIC""? O excluded? \n\n  ""CYNIC""? But position 3 is N? Excluded? \n\n  ""CURVY""? Not? \n\n  So I think it\'s not easy to test for duplicate I? \n\n  Therefore, I will go with ""CHILD"" as the third guess? \n\n  But let\'s see the feedback we have: we know position 1,3,4 are fixed? And position 2 must be H? And position 5 is unknown? \n\n  So I\'ll guess ""CHILD"". \n\n  But note: in the feedback for ""coils"", we had S absent? But in ""CHILD"", there is no S? So that\'s fine? \n\n  So guess: ""child""\n\n  But wait, we have to output in the format.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try to think of a word that tests more letters? But we have only two positions? And one of them we are confident is H? \n\n  So I think it\'s acceptable to guess ""CHILD"". \n\n  If we are wrong, we get information about the last letter? \n\n  So let\'s do that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  \n  - **C** is correct and in position 1.  \n  - **R, A, N, E** are absent from the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""coils"" → Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)**  \n  - **C** is correct (position 1, already known).  \n  - **O** is absent.  \n  - **I** is correct and in position 3.  \n  - **L** is correct and in position 4.  \n  - **S** is absent.  \n\n### Key Insights\n1. **Fixed positions**:  \n   - Position 1: **C**  \n   - Position 3: **I**  \n   - Position 4: **L**  \n   - The word structure is: **C _ I L _** (only positions 2 and 5 are unknown).  \n\n2. **Absent letters**:  \n   - **R, A, N, E, O, S** cannot appear anywhere in the word.  \n\n3. **Possible letters for positions 2 and 5**:  \n   - Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n   - Available vowels (since E, A, O are out): I, U (but I is already used at position 3; duplicates are possible).  \n\n4. **Candidate words**:  \n   - After eliminating invalid letters, common English words fitting **C _ I L _** are:  \n     - **CHILL** (C H I L L)  \n     - **CHILD** (C H I L D)  \n     - **CHILI** (C H I L I)  \n   - All candidates share **H** in position 2.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3\n- **Goal**: Test the variable position 5 (last letter) while confirming **H** in position 2.  \n- **Why ""child""?**  \n  - It tests **H** in position 2 (common to all candidates).  \n  - It tests **D** in position 5 (which, if absent, eliminates **CHILD** and narrows to **CHILL** or **CHILI**).  \n  - If correct, we solve the puzzle.

We are given feedback from the third guess ""child"":
Feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x)

This means:
- C, H, I, L are in their correct positions (positions 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively).
- D is not in the word (x).

Previous feedback:
- Guess 1: Eliminated R, A, N, E.
- Guess 2: Eliminated O and S.

So, the word so far is: C H I L ?  (with position 5 unknown)

We know the word ends with C H I L _.

The fifth letter cannot be any of the eliminated letters: R, A, N, E, O, S, D (from Guess 3).

Remaining possibilities?
From earlier, we had three candidates: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI.
- CHILD is eliminated because D is absent.
- CHILL ends with L (but note: we already have an L in position 4).
- CHILI ends with I (and we have an I in position 3).

We must consider if duplicate letters are possible.

Feedback for Guess 3: The last letter D is absent. So the word is not CHILD.

Therefore, the word must be either:
- CHILL: with a second L at the end? Then we have two L's? But we know L is at position 4. So position 5 would be L.
- CHILI: then position 5 is I? And we know I is at position 3, so two I's.

We haven't eliminated L or I? So both are possible? But we also know the eliminated letters? So the fifth letter must be either L or I? Any other possibilities?

Are there other words that fit C H I L _ ?
We need common English words.

Pattern: C H I L _ 

Fifth letter possibilities (excluding R, A, N, E, O, S, D)? 
Available letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and also: I, L? Because duplicates might be allowed?

But note: the word must be valid? 

Let me list:
- CHILL: ends with L? Valid.
- CHILI: ends with I? Valid.

Are there others? 
- CHIEF? But E is excluded? And it doesn't end with L? Pattern: C H I E F -> matches C H I L _ ? No? We need L at position 4? So it must have L at position 4? 

Other words?
- ""CHIEL""? But E is excluded and it would be C H I E L -> doesn't fix position 4 as L? It has E at position 4? So doesn't fit? 

- ""CHIRL""? Not a word? 
- ""CHIZZ""? Not a word? 
- ""CHIVY""? But V? And E? Excluded? 

Common words: Only CHILL and CHILI seem plausible.

We have to guess between CHILL and CHILI.

We can test one? For example, guess ""CHILL"" as fourth guess.

If we guess ""CHILL"":
  - If correct, done.
  - If not, we get feedback: 
        For CHILL: if the word is CHILI, then the last letter L vs I? 
        Feedback: position 1: C ✓, position 2: H ✓, position 3: I ✓, position 4: L ✓, position 5: L -> but the word has I? So if the word is CHILI, then L at position 5 is absent? So we get L(x) at position 5? 
        Then we know to try CHILI? 

Similarly, if we guess ""CHILI"" and it's wrong, we get I(x) at position 5? Then we try CHILL.

But we have 3 guesses left? So it's safe? 

Alternatively, to maximize information? We don't have much to test? We already have all positions fixed except the last one? And we know the letter is either L or I? 

Also, if we guess ""CHILL"", we also test if L can be duplicated? But since we know L is at position 4, we are testing if there is an additional L at position 5? 

But I think we can guess ""CHILL"" now? 

But note: we have two candidates? 

Let me choose ""CHILL"" as the guess? 

But why? Because L is more common as a last letter? Or arbitrarily? 

Since we cannot get additional information without guessing one? 

We'll guess ""CHILL"". 

If it works, we win; if not, we know it's ""CHILI"".

Alternatively, we can guess a word that includes both possibilities? But we don't? 

For example, to test if there's a duplicate I? But we don't know? 

But we don't need to? We can just guess one candidate? 

So guess ""chill""? 

But let's output: ""chill""

Response would be: <guess>chill</guess>

### Analysis of Feedback:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  - Position 1 is **C**, and **R, A, N, E** are absent.  
- **Guess 2: ""coils"" → Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)**  
  - Position 3 is **I**, position 4 is **L**, and **O, S** are absent.  
- **Guess 3: ""child"" → Feedback: C(✓)✓) I(✓) L(✓)✓)**  
  - Position 2 is **H**, and **D** is absent.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **C**  
   - Position 2: **H**  
   - Position 3: **I**  
   - Position 4: **L**  
   - The word structure is **C H I L _**.  

2. **Absent letters**:  
   - **R, A, N, E, O, S, D** cannot appear (eliminated from feedback).  

3. **Possible words for position 5**:  
   - Only letters not eliminated are viable: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, or duplicates of existing letters (like **I** or **L**).  
   - Common English words fitting **C H I L _** are:  
     - **CHILL** (ends with **L**)  
     - **CHILI** (ends with **I**)  
   - Both are valid, and no other common words match.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test the most likely candidate first.  
- **Why ""chill""?**  
  - **CHILL** prioritizes a consonant (less common than vowels) for potential elimination.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on position 5 will confirm the letter (e.g., if **L** is marked absent, the word must be **CHILI**).  
- **Efficiency**:  
  - 1 guess to win if correct.  
  - 1 additional guess max if incorrect, with 2 tries remaining.  

<guess>chill</guess>",chill,"We are given feedback from the third guess ""child"":
Feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x)

This means:
- C, H, I, L are in their correct positions (positions 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively).
- D is not in the word (x).

Previous feedback:
- Guess 1: Eliminated R, A, N, E.
- Guess 2: Eliminated O and S.

So, the word so far is: C H I L ?  (with position 5 unknown)

We know the word ends with C H I L _.

The fifth letter cannot be any of the eliminated letters: R, A, N, E, O, S, D (from Guess 3).

Remaining possibilities?
From earlier, we had three candidates: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI.
- CHILD is eliminated because D is absent.
- CHILL ends with L (but note: we already have an L in position 4).
- CHILI ends with I (and we have an I in position 3).

We must consider if duplicate letters are possible.

Feedback for Guess 3: The last letter D is absent. So the word is not CHILD.

Therefore, the word must be either:
- CHILL: with a second L at the end? Then we have two L's? But we know L is at position 4. So position 5 would be L.
- CHILI: then position 5 is I? And we know I is at position 3, so two I's.

We haven't eliminated L or I? So both are possible? But we also know the eliminated letters? So the fifth letter must be either L or I? Any other possibilities?

Are there other words that fit C H I L _ ?
We need common English words.

Pattern: C H I L _ 

Fifth letter possibilities (excluding R, A, N, E, O, S, D)? 
Available letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and also: I, L? Because duplicates might be allowed?

But note: the word must be valid? 

Let me list:
- CHILL: ends with L? Valid.
- CHILI: ends with I? Valid.

Are there others? 
- CHIEF? But E is excluded? And it doesn't end with L? Pattern: C H I E F -> matches C H I L _ ? No? We need L at position 4? So it must have L at position 4? 

Other words?
- ""CHIEL""? But E is excluded and it would be C H I E L -> doesn't fix position 4 as L? It has E at position 4? So doesn't fit? 

- ""CHIRL""? Not a word? 
- ""CHIZZ""? Not a word? 
- ""CHIVY""? But V? And E? Excluded? 

Common words: Only CHILL and CHILI seem plausible.

We have to guess between CHILL and CHILI.

We can test one? For example, guess ""CHILL"" as fourth guess.

If we guess ""CHILL"":
  - If correct, done.
  - If not, we get feedback: 
        For CHILL: if the word is CHILI, then the last letter L vs I? 
        Feedback: position 1: C ✓, position 2: H ✓, position 3: I ✓, position 4: L ✓, position 5: L -> but the word has I? So if the word is CHILI, then L at position 5 is absent? So we get L(x) at position 5? 
        Then we know to try CHILI? 

Similarly, if we guess ""CHILI"" and it's wrong, we get I(x) at position 5? Then we try CHILL.

But we have 3 guesses left? So it's safe? 

Alternatively, to maximize information? We don't have much to test? We already have all positions fixed except the last one? And we know the letter is either L or I? 

Also, if we guess ""CHILL"", we also test if L can be duplicated? But since we know L is at position 4, we are testing if there is an additional L at position 5? 

But I think we can guess ""CHILL"" now? 

But note: we have two candidates? 

Let me choose ""CHILL"" as the guess? 

But why? Because L is more common as a last letter? Or arbitrarily? 

Since we cannot get additional information without guessing one? 

We'll guess ""CHILL"". 

If it works, we win; if not, we know it's ""CHILI"".

Alternatively, we can guess a word that includes both possibilities? But we don't? 

For example, to test if there's a duplicate I? But we don't know? 

But we don't need to? We can just guess one candidate? 

So guess ""chill""? 

But let's output: ""chill""

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all fairly common in English words.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"":
 Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x N(x) E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R, A, N, E are all not in the word at all (marked with x).

 Important note: Since only C is correct and in position 1, and the other letters are absent, we know:
 - The first letter is C.
 - The word does not contain R, A, N, or E.

 We need to make a second guess. The word starts with C, and does not contain R, A, N, E.

 Let's think about possible words that start with C and avoid the letters R,A,N,E.

 Since we have only one correct letter so far, we want to use this guess to get more information about the other letters.

 We should choose a word that:
 1. Starts with C (since position 1 is fixed as C).
 2. Uses new letters that we haven't tried yet to maximize information.

 Avoid using any of the disallowed letters: R, A, N, E.

 Available letters: We can use letters from the rest of the alphabet excluding R,A,N,E.

 We also want to cover common letters. Common consonants might be T, L, S, etc., and vowels might be I, O, U (since E,A are out).

 Let me try to think of a word that starts with C and has other common letters.

 Some possibilities: 
 - Could try words like ""C"" + a combination of T, L, S, H, O, I, U, etc.

 Examples: 
   ""CHILL"", but we have 5 letters and ""CHILL"" is 5 letters? Let's check: C-H-I-L-L -> but it has L repeated? Actually, ""CHILL"" is C-H-I-L-L, so yes. However, repeated L might not be ideal for information.
   ""CLIMB"" -> C, L, I, M, B -> only unique letters? Yes.

 Let me list some words:
   ""COULD"" -> contains O, U, L, D -> but O and U are vowels? Actually, we don't know about vowels yet except that A and E are not present.
   ""C"" followed by other popular letters: T, L, S, H, O, I, U, etc.

 We have already eliminated 4 letters: R, A, N, E. So we have 22 letters left.

 Since we need to maximize information, we should try to include letters that are frequent in 5-letter words.

 According to English letter frequency, after the top letters we've excluded, we have: 
   E (excluded), A (excluded), then common ones: T, O, I, S, H, etc.

 But without E and A, we have T, O, I, S, H, R (but R is excluded) -> R is excluded? Yes, in our feedback R was x, meaning absent.

 So possible words: 
   ""COST"" is only 4 letters, so no.
   ""CLOUD"" -> C L O U D -> contains O and U (vowels) and L, D. This might be good because it introduces new vowels and consonants.

   ""CHIST""? That's not a word. 
   ""CHISL""? Not a word.

   ""COULY""? Not a common word.

   ""COILS"" -> C, O, I, L, S: all unique and new? But we don't know about S. Also, we haven't tried S, O, I, L.

   ""CIVIL"" -> C, I, V, I, L -> but repeated I? Actually, 'I' appears twice? Spelling ""civil"" has two I's? Position 2 and 4? Actually, word: C-I-V-I-L -> that's one I? Wait: C-I-V-I-L? No, it's C-I-V-I-L? Actually, it has two I's. Positions: 2 and 4. So repeated letter? Not ideal.

   ""CHOMP"" -> C, H, O, M, P. All unique? Yes.

   ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S. This might be good? But note we have S.

   ""CURLY"" -> but contains R -> disallowed? We cannot use R.

   Let me think: avoid R,A,N,E.

   Some candidates:
   - ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D.
   - ""CHOPD""? Not a word.
   - ""CHOPS"": C, H, O, P, S -> valid word? Yes.

   ""CHOPS"": meaning to cut. So ""CHOPS"" is acceptable.

   Another: ""CLOMP""? Not common, but valid? However, not as common as ""CHOPS"".

   ""COVER"": but contains E -> E is disallowed.

   ""QUA?"" -> not starting with C.

   ""C"" and then try to get information about vowels? We know the word doesn't have A or E, so vowels must be O, I, U? Or none? But most English words have vowels.

   Alternatively, ""SPLIT"" -> doesn't start with C.

   We need words starting with C.

   Let me think of common words: 
      ""COULD"" -> uses O, U, L, D -> but U and O?
      ""COAST"" -> but has A -> disallowed? A is excluded.

   ""COAST"" contains A -> so we cannot use A. Hence invalid.

   ""CHART"" -> contains A -> disallowed.

   ""CUT"" -> too short.

   ""CUBIC""? That has two C's? But we already know the first letter is C. The word might have another C? Our feedback for first guess didn't say anything about duplicate C? But we didn't have a duplicate. Now, it's possible? Yes.

   However, to maximize new letters, we might avoid repeating C? But since we only have one C so far? But we don't know if there are duplicates.

   Let me choose a word that avoids duplication and avoids the disallowed letters.

   Words: 
      ""COMBS"" -> C, O, M, B, S -> unique letters? Yes? But ""COMBS"" is a word? Yes (noun meaning the bees' home or verb meaning to groom hair?).

   ""COMET"" -> but E is disallowed.

   ""COMIC"" -> but repeated C? We know position 1 is C, so we would put C at position 1 again? Then the word starts with C. The other C? At position 4? We don't know if that would be correct. But also it has I.

   Let me consider: 
   Criteria: We want to test vowels? Since we've eliminated E and A, we could try O and I? Or U?

   ""COINS"" -> O and I? But contains I, O, N? Wait: does ""COINS"" contain N? COINS: C, O, I, N, S -> but N is disallowed? We know N is not in the word.

   Therefore, we must avoid N.

   So ""COINS"" is invalid because of N.

   ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S -> all new? And no A, E, N, R? Yes.

   Let's try ""CHOPS"": 
      If the word is ""CHOPS"" itself? Then we win? But we don't know yet.

   If not, we can get feedback on H, O, P, S.

   Alternatively, ""CLOUD"" -> C, L, O, U, D -> also good? But U is less common.

   Let me prioritize letters that are more common. Without E, A, R, N, what are the next common? 
   After E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S -> but R, A, N are out -> then common: I, O, T, S.

   So I, O, T, S are good.

   Now, we have positions 2-5: unknown.

   We are trying: 
      Option 1: ""CHOPS"": uses H, O, P, S -> note: H is not among the top? Well, H is common. 
      Option 2: ""COSTS"" -> but repeated S? Not ideal.

   ""COILS"": C, O, I, L, S -> avoids E, A, R, N? Yes. And uses O, I, L, S? L is common.

   So ""COILS"" is a word? Yes, meaning wires wound in a spiral.

   Let me compare ""CHOPS"" and ""COILS"". Both are valid.

   Which one covers more frequent letters?

   Among O, I: O and I are vowel-like. Then L vs H? L is more common than H? 
   Letter frequency: 
        O: 4th? (without E,A,R) -> actually in English, E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S are top. We have R,A,N,E out? So top remaining: I, O, T, S.

   ""CHOPS"": H, O, P, S -> O and S are very common. P is somewhat common? 
   ""COILS"": O, I, L, S -> I, O, S are common? L is also common? Actually L is 12th overall? 

   Both include O and S.

   Now, we want to avoid the possibility that we run into duplicates? 

   Since we don't know if the word has duplicates? We are free to use duplicates? However, for maximum information, unique letters are better.

   Both are unique? 
      ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S: unique? C is at start? We are introducing H,O,P,S -> all distinct? Yes.
      ""COILS"" -> C, O, I, L, S: distinct? Yes.

   ""COILS"" introduces I and L? Which I haven't tried? And O and S. While ""CHOPS"" introduces H and P? 

   But H and P are less common than I and L? Because I is a vowel and more common? 

   According to letter frequency in English:
      I: about 6.9% 
      O: 7.5%
      L: 4%
      S: 6.3%
      H: 6%
      P: 1.9%

   So ""COILS"" has I (6.9%), O (7.5%), L (4%), S (6.3%)? Total? But we don't count the fixed C? Actually, we are only concerned about the new positions? 

   Overall, ""COILS"" provides letters: O (common), I (common), L (medium), S (common). 
   ""CHOPS"" provides: H (about 6%), O (common), P (less common), S (common).

   Therefore, I think ""COILS"" covers more of the common remaining letters? Because H (6%) vs I (almost 7%)? And P is 1.9% vs L at 4%. 

   So ""COILS"" might be slightly better? Especially because L is more common than P.

   Moreover, we are testing two vowels? The word must have vowels? Since we know E and A are out? So O and I are good candidates.

   Therefore, I choose ""COILS"".

   Second guess: ""coils""

   So the guessed word: <guess>coils</guess><reasoning>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- The letter ""C"" is correct and in position 1 (marked ✓).
- The letters ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word (marked x).

Key implications:
1. The correct word starts with ""C"".
2. The word contains none of these letters: R, A, N, E.
3. We need to probe remaining letters to identify possibilities.

For the second guess:
- Must start with ""C"" to preserve the known position-1 letter.
- Avoid using R, A, N, E.
- Use common English letters not yet tested to maximize information gain.
- Prioritize unique letters with high frequency (since duplicates reduce information).

Optimal strategy:
- Focus on common remaining consonants (like L, S, T, H) and vowels (O, I, U).
- Avoid reusing eliminated letters.

Selected word: **""COILS""**
- Starts with ""C"" as required.
- Uses new letters: O, I, L, S (all untested and high frequency).
- Avoids disallowed letters (no R, A, N, E).
- Maximizes information potential: Covers two vowels (O, I) and two common consonants (L, S).

<guess>coils</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: coils -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""coils"" -> Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)
  - C is correct and in position 1 (as we already knew).
  - O is absent (so the word does not contain O).
  - I is correct and in position 3? Let's see: 
        Position: 1:C, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:S
    So I is in position 3 and correct (✓).
  - L is correct and in position 4 (since it's the 4th letter and marked ✓).
  - S is absent.

So now we know:
- The word starts with C (position 1).
- Position 3 is I.
- Position 4 is L.
- The word does not contain: R, A, N, E, O, S. (from the x's in both guesses)
- The word does contain I and L, but we already have their positions.

Also, note that in ""coils"", the O and S were absent, so we add O and S to the absent letters.

Current known:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: ? (unknown, but cannot be O, R, A, N, E, S)
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: ? (unknown, but cannot be O, R, A, N, E, S)

We also know the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

Now, what letters are possible for position 2 and 5?
We have eliminated: R, A, N, E, O, S.

So the available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we have I and L in the word, but they are already placed. So we don't need to test them again? Actually, we don't know if they appear again? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? However, in the feedback for ""coils"", we had I and L marked correct, but if there were duplicates, we might not know? But in Wordle, if a letter appears only once and you use it twice, one might be marked as absent? But in this case, we didn't use duplicates.

But we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we don't have any indication so far.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits:
  C _ I L _

And the missing letters (position 2 and 5) must be from the available set.

We also want to maximize information? But we have two positions to fill. We might be able to guess the word? Or we can try to test more letters.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess? We have 6 tries total, so we have 4 left? But we might get it.

Let's think of possible words that fit the pattern: C _ I L _

With the constraints on the missing letters.

Possible letters for position 2: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Position 5: same set? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

Common words that fit:
  ""CHILL"": C H I L L -> but we have L at position 4 and then L at position 5? So duplicate L? And we know L is in position 4, so if we put L at position 5, it might be correct? But we don't know if L is duplicated? Also, in our second guess, we had L at position 4 and it was correct, but we didn't have L at position 5? So if the word has two L's, then in ""coils"" we only had one L? Then the feedback for the L in position 4 would be correct, but we wouldn't know about the other L? Actually, in Wordle, if the word has two L's and you guess one L in the correct position and no other L, then the feedback would only show one L as correct? But if you guess a word with one L and the word has two, then the feedback might not indicate the missing one? Actually, the feedback only tells you about the letters you guessed? So if the word has two L's and you only guess one, then you won't know about the second one? 

But in this case, we are trying to guess the word. We have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, without evidence, we might assume no duplicates? But we can't.

But let's list possible words:

  ""CHILL"": C H I L L -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L -> but we have position 4 as L, and then position 5 as L? But we don't know if L is duplicated? Also, H is allowed? And we haven't tested H? But in the second guess, we didn't use H? So H is a possibility.

  ""CHILD"": C H I L D -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D -> this is a valid word? Yes.

  ""CIVIL"": C I V I L -> but wait, position 3 is I? But in ""CIVIL"", position 2 is I? Then position 3 is V? But we have position 3 fixed as I? So ""CIVIL"" would be: C (1), I (2), V (3), I (4), L (5) -> but we need position 3 to be I? In ""CIVIL"", position 3 is V, not I? So it doesn't fit? Because we have position 3 fixed as I? So ""CIVIL"" is not matching.

  ""BUILD""? Doesn't start with C.

  ""CLIMB"": C L I M B -> but we have position 4 as L? In ""CLIMB"": position 1:C, 2:L, 3:I, 4:M, 5:B -> but we need position 4 to be L? So it doesn't match.

  We need position 3 to be I and position 4 to be L? So the pattern is: C (letter2) I L (letter5)

  Other words:
    ""CHILI""? But that's 5 letters? C-H-I-L-I -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:I -> so it fits? But we have two I's? And we know I is in position 3? Then position 5 is I? So that's possible? But we haven't tested I in position 5? And we don't know if I can be duplicated? Also, in the second guess, we had I only at position 3? So if the word has two I's, we wouldn't know? 

  ""CHILL"" and ""CHILI"" and ""CHILD"" are candidates.

  Also, ""CIVIL"" doesn't fit because position 3 is V, not I? But we have position 3 fixed as I.

  ""TRAIL""? But T and R? R is excluded? And doesn't start with C.

  ""FLAIL""? Doesn't start with C and has A? A is excluded.

  ""QUAIL""? Same.

  So let's list possible words that start with C, have I at position 3, L at position 4, and the second letter and fifth letter from the allowed set.

  For position 2: we have many options: H, T, U, V, W, etc.

  Common words:
    - CHILL
    - CHILD
    - CHILI
    - CRILL? Not a word.
    - CVILL? Not a word.

  Also, ""CECIL""? But C is at position 1 and then E? But E is excluded? So no.

  ""COLIC""? But O is excluded? And we have position 3 as I? ""COLIC"": C O L I C -> but position 3 is L? Not I? So doesn't fit.

  ""CUBIC""? C U B I C -> but position 3 is B? Not I? So no.

  ""CIVIC""? C I V I C -> position 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:C -> but we need position 3 to be I? It's V? So no.

  So the main candidates are: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI.

  Also, ""CHIRL""? Not a word.

  ""CHIRP""? But then position 4 would be R? But we need L at position 4? And R is excluded? So no.

  ""CHIRL"" not a word.

  ""CHIRM""? Not common? And position 4 would be R? No.

  So we have:
    CHILL: C H I L L
    CHILD: C H I L D
    CHILI: C H I L I

  Also, ""CHIEL""? But E is excluded? And position 5 is L? But we have position 4 as L? So ""CHIEL"" would be C H I E L -> but E is excluded? And position 4 is E? But we need L at position 4? So no.

  ""CHIRK""? But R is excluded? And position 4 would be R? No.

  ""CHIRT""? Same.

  ""CHIVE""? But E is excluded? And position 5 is E? No.

  ""CHIMP""? But position 4 would be M? Not L? So no.

  So the only common words I can think of are: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI.

  Now, we have to choose one? But we don't know which one? We have to test.

  We can try to guess one of them? But if we guess wrong, we get feedback and then we can guess again? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can try.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions to fill? And we know the pattern? So we might as well guess one of the candidates? But which one?

  But note: we haven't tested the letter H? In the second guess we didn't use H? So we don't know if H is in the word? But in the pattern, position 2 is H in all these candidates? So if we guess a word that doesn't have H? But we don't have any candidate without H? So we must test H? Actually, if we guess one of these, we will find out about H? Because if the word is CHILL, then H is present? But if we guess CHILL and the word is CHILD, then we get feedback that H is correct? But we already know that? Because we are putting H in position 2? And if it's correct, then we get H(✓) and then we know? But we also get the last letter? 

  However, we have three candidates: 
      CHILL: last letter L -> but we already know L is in the word? But if we guess CHILL, then the last letter L? We don't know if it's correct? But we know position 4 is L? So if we put L at position 5, it might be correct? Or not? 

  But in the feedback for ""coils"", we had L at position 4 correct? But we don't know if there is another L? So if we guess CHILL, and the word is CHILL, then we get all correct? If the word is CHILD, then we get: 
        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(?) -> but the last letter is L? But the word is CHILD, so last letter is D? So the last L would be absent? And we get feedback: L at position 5 is absent? Then we know it's not CHILL? Then we can guess CHILD? 

  Similarly, if we guess CHILD and the word is CHILL, then we get: 
        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> then we know the last letter is not D? Then we can guess CHILL? 

  But we have only two positions to fill? And we are testing the last letter? 

  Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't have H? But then we can test if H is present? But we don't have a candidate without H? So we must test H? 

  But note: we can also test multiple letters? For example, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a different last letter? But we don't know the last letter? 

  However, we have three candidates? We can try to guess a word that is not one of the candidates? But that might not be efficient? 

  Let me think: we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, or I? But we don't know? 

  But we want to maximize information? We have two unknowns: 
      - Is H in the word? (but in the pattern, position 2 must be H? because all candidates have H? So if we don't put H, then we might not get the word? But we don't know if H is the only possibility? 

  Actually, are there other words? For example, ""CVILL"" is not a word? ""CWHIL""? Not a word? ""CZHIL""? No? 

  What about ""CABIL""? But A is excluded? 

  ""CEDIL""? E excluded? 

  ""CFILM""? Not a word? 

  ""CHIRL""? Not a word? 

  So it seems the only common words are CHILL, CHILD, CHILI? 

  But wait, ""CHILI"" has two I's? So if we guess ""CHILI"", then we have I at position 3 and 5? 

  Now, we haven't tested for duplicate I? In the second guess, we had I at position 3? And we don't know if there is another I? 

  So the candidates are:
      CHILL: C H I L L
      CHILD: C H I L D
      CHILI: C H I L I

  We can try to guess one of them? 

  But we have 4 guesses? So we can try one? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the last letter? But we don't have a word that covers multiple? 

  But note: we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, or I? But that might not be a word? 

  For example, ""CHIRP""? But R is excluded? 

  ""CHINK""? But N is excluded? 

  ""CHIMP""? But M? And position 4 would be M? But we need L at position 4? So we cannot change position 4? 

  We have to keep position 3 as I and position 4 as L? 

  So we are forced to have the pattern: C H I L ? 

  And the last letter must be one of: L, D, I? (from the candidates) but also other possibilities? But we don't have other common words? 

  What about ""CHIEL""? But E excluded? 

  ""CHIRL""? Not a word? 

  ""CHIZZ""? Not a word? 

  ""CHIVY""? But V? And E? Excluded? 

  So I think the only common words are the three: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI. 

  Now, we can try to guess ""CHILL"" first? 

  If it's correct, we win? 

  If not, we get feedback: 
      If the word is CHILD: 
          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(x) -> because the last letter is D, not L? 
      Then we know the last letter is not L? So we can try CHILD? 

      If the word is CHILI: 
          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(?) -> but the last letter of CHILI is I? So we have L at position 5? But the word has I at position 5? So L would be absent? Then we get: L(x) at position 5? Then we know it's not CHILL? Then we can try CHILI? 

  But wait, if we guess CHILL and the word is CHILI, we get:
        Position 1: C ✓
        Position 2: H ✓ (if H is correct? But in CHILI, position 2 is H? So H is correct? 
        Position 3: I ✓
        Position 4: L ✓
        Position 5: L -> but the word has I at position 5? So L is not present? Because the word CHILI has only one L? At position 4? So the L at position 5 is absent? So we get: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(x)

  Then we know the last letter is not L? So we can try CHILD? But if we try CHILD and the word is CHILI, then we get:
        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> because last letter is I, not D? 
        Then we know it's not CHILD? Then we try CHILI? 

  So we might need two more guesses? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the last letter without committing to H? But we don't have a word? 

  Or we can try a word that has a different second letter? But we don't know any other second letter? 

  But wait, is it possible that the second letter is not H? We assumed it must be H? But are there other words? 

  Let me double-check: 
      Pattern: C _ I L _ 
      With the missing letters not in {R, A, N, E, O, S}

  Other words? 
      ""CUTIN""? But position 4 is I? Not L? 
      ""CIVIL"" we already saw doesn't fit? 
      ""CLIFT""? But position 2 is L? Then position 3 is I? Position 4 is F? Not L? 
      ""CLINT""? But N is excluded? 
      ""CLIPT""? Not a word? 
      ""CULCH""? But position 3 is L? Not I? 
      ""CULTI""? C U L T I -> position 3 is L? Not I? 
      ""CURIO""? But O is excluded? 
      ""CURVY""? But position 3 is R? Excluded? 
      ""CWTCH""? Not a word? 
      ""CYCLO""? O excluded? 

  What about ""CHIRP""? Not? 

  ""CHIPS""? But S is excluded? And position 4 is P? Not L? 

  So I think H is the only possibility for position 2? 

  Therefore, we must have H at position 2? 

  Then the word is C H I L ? 

  And the last letter must be one of: L, D, I? 

  Now, we can try to guess ""CHILD"" because it has a different last letter? 

  But we don't know? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, I? But that would not be a candidate? And we might waste a guess? 

  But we can try to test multiple letters? For example, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then in the last position, we put a letter that is common? But we don't know? 

  However, we have only three candidates? So we can try one? 

  Let me choose ""CHILD"" as the guess? Because it has a D? And we haven't tested D? 

  If we guess ""CHILD"": 
      If the word is CHILD: we win? 
      If the word is CHILL: we get feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> then we know the last letter is not D? So we try CHILL? 
      If the word is CHILI: we get feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> same as above? Then we know it's not D? Then we try CHILI? 

  But wait, if we get D(x) for both CHILL and CHILI? Then we don't know which one? Because both CHILL and CHILI have last letter not D? So we would have to try both? 

  Actually, if we guess ""CHILD"" and the word is CHILL, we get D(x) and then we know the last letter is not D? Then we try CHILL? 
  If we guess ""CHILD"" and the word is CHILI, we get D(x) and then we try CHILI? 

  But we don't know which one? So we might need to try both? 

  Alternatively, we can try ""CHILI"": 
      If the word is CHILI: win? 
      If the word is CHILL: we get last letter L? But wait, in ""CHILI"", we have I at position 5? But the word CHILL has L at position 5? So we get: 
          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) I(?) -> for CHILL, the last letter is L? So the I at position 5 is absent? Because CHILL has only one I? At position 3? So we get I(x) at position 5? 
      Then we know the last letter is not I? So we try CHILL? 
      If the word is CHILD: we get I(x) at position 5? Then we know the last letter is not I? So we try CHILD? 

  But again, we don't know which one? 

  So in either case, if we guess one candidate and it's wrong, we get the last letter wrong? And then we know to try the other two? But we have two left? Then we can try one of the remaining two? 

  Since we have 4 guesses left? We can do: 
      Guess 3: CHILD 
      If correct, done.
      If not, then we get feedback: 
          If the word is CHILL: we get D(x) -> then we know to try CHILL next? 
          If the word is CHILI: we get D(x) -> then we know to try CHILI next? 
      Then guess 4: either CHILL or CHILI? But we don't know which one? 

  But we don't know which one? So we have to choose arbitrarily? 

  Alternatively, we can try a word that is not a candidate? But that tests the last letter? 

  For example, we can try a word that has the same pattern but with a different last letter? But we don't know? 

  But we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, I? But that might not be a word? 

  For example, ""CHIRP"" is not allowed? 

  ""CHIMB""? Not a word? 

  ""CHIMP""? But then position 4 would be M? But we have to keep position 4 as L? 

  We cannot change position 4? 

  So we are stuck? 

  Another idea: we can try a word that has the same pattern but with a letter that we haven't used? For example, ""CHIML""? Not a word? 

  Or ""CHUGL""? Not a word? 

  So I think we have to guess one of the candidates? 

  Let me choose ""CHILD"" as the third guess? 

  If it's correct, we win? 

  If not, we get feedback that the last letter is not D? Then we have two options: CHILL and CHILI? 

  Then we can try ""CHILL"" next? If it's not, then it must be ""CHILI""? 

  But we have 4 guesses? So we can do that? 

  Alternatively, we can try to test for duplicate I? But how? 

  We can try a word that has I at position 5? But we don't have a word that has I at position 5 and H at position 2? But ""CHILI"" does? But that's a candidate? 

  Or we can try a word that has I at a different position? But we don't know? 

  For example, we can try ""DUTCH""? But doesn't start with C? 

  ""PITCH""? But position 1 is P? 

  We need to start with C? 

  ""C"" and then a word that has I at position 5? But we have position 3 fixed as I? So if we put I at position 5, then we have two I's? 

  For example, ""CUBIC""? But position 3 is B? Not I? 

  ""CIVIC""? But position 3 is V? 

  ""CONIC""? O excluded? 

  ""CYNIC""? But position 3 is N? Excluded? 

  ""CURVY""? Not? 

  So I think it's not easy to test for duplicate I? 

  Therefore, I will go with ""CHILD"" as the third guess? 

  But let's see the feedback we have: we know position 1,3,4 are fixed? And position 2 must be H? And position 5 is unknown? 

  So I'll guess ""CHILD"". 

  But note: in the feedback for ""coils"", we had S absent? But in ""CHILD"", there is no S? So that's fine? 

  So guess: ""child""

  But wait, we have to output in the format.

  Alternatively, we can try to think of a word that tests more letters? But we have only two positions? And one of them we are confident is H? 

  So I think it's acceptable to guess ""CHILD"". 

  If we are wrong, we get information about the last letter? 

  So let's do that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  - **C** is correct and in position 1.  
  - **R, A, N, E** are absent from the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""coils"" → Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)**  
  - **C** is correct (position 1, already known).  
  - **O** is absent.  
  - **I** is correct and in position 3.  
  - **L** is correct and in position 4.  
  - **S** is absent.  

### Key Insights
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **C**  
   - Position 3: **I**  
   - Position 4: **L**  
   - The word structure is: **C _ I L _** (only positions 2 and 5 are unknown).  

2. **Absent letters**:  
   - **R, A, N, E, O, S** cannot appear anywhere in the word.  

3. **Possible letters for positions 2 and 5**:  
   - Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   - Available vowels (since E, A, O are out): I, U (but I is already used at position 3; duplicates are possible).  

4. **Candidate words**:  
   - After eliminating invalid letters, common English words fitting **C _ I L _** are:  
     - **CHILL** (C H I L L)  
     - **CHILD** (C H I L D)  
     - **CHILI** (C H I L I)  
   - All candidates share **H** in position 2.  

### Strategy for Guess 3
- **Goal**: Test the variable position 5 (last letter) while confirming **H** in position 2.  
- **Why ""child""?**  
  - It tests **H** in position 2 (common to all candidates).  
  - It tests **D** in position 5 (which, if absent, eliminates **CHILD** and narrows to **CHILL** or **CHILI**).  
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle. If not, feedback on **D** will reduce possibilities for the next guess.  
- **Risk**: If **D** is absent, we still have 3 guesses left to distinguish between **CHILL** and **CHILI**.  

### Next Steps
- If **D** is correct (✓), the word is **CHILD**.  
- If **D** is absent (x), the word is either **CHILL** or **CHILI** (guess **CHILL** next).

<guess>child</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: coils -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)
Guess 3: child -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the third guess ""child"":
Feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x)

This means:
- C, H, I, L are in their correct positions (positions 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively).
- D is not in the word (x).

Previous feedback:
- Guess 1: Eliminated R, A, N, E.
- Guess 2: Eliminated O and S.

So, the word so far is: C H I L ?  (with position 5 unknown)

We know the word ends with C H I L _.

The fifth letter cannot be any of the eliminated letters: R, A, N, E, O, S, D (from Guess 3).

Remaining possibilities?
From earlier, we had three candidates: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI.
- CHILD is eliminated because D is absent.
- CHILL ends with L (but note: we already have an L in position 4).
- CHILI ends with I (and we have an I in position 3).

We must consider if duplicate letters are possible.

Feedback for Guess 3: The last letter D is absent. So the word is not CHILD.

Therefore, the word must be either:
- CHILL: with a second L at the end? Then we have two L's? But we know L is at position 4. So position 5 would be L.
- CHILI: then position 5 is I? And we know I is at position 3, so two I's.

We haven't eliminated L or I? So both are possible? But we also know the eliminated letters? So the fifth letter must be either L or I? Any other possibilities?

Are there other words that fit C H I L _ ?
We need common English words.

Pattern: C H I L _ 

Fifth letter possibilities (excluding R, A, N, E, O, S, D)? 
Available letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and also: I, L? Because duplicates might be allowed?

But note: the word must be valid? 

Let me list:
- CHILL: ends with L? Valid.
- CHILI: ends with I? Valid.

Are there others? 
- CHIEF? But E is excluded? And it doesn't end with L? Pattern: C H I E F -> matches C H I L _ ? No? We need L at position 4? So it must have L at position 4? 

Other words?
- ""CHIEL""? But E is excluded and it would be C H I E L -> doesn't fix position 4 as L? It has E at position 4? So doesn't fit? 

- ""CHIRL""? Not a word? 
- ""CHIZZ""? Not a word? 
- ""CHIVY""? But V? And E? Excluded? 

Common words: Only CHILL and CHILI seem plausible.

We have to guess between CHILL and CHILI.

We can test one? For example, guess ""CHILL"" as fourth guess.

If we guess ""CHILL"":
  - If correct, done.
  - If not, we get feedback: 
        For CHILL: if the word is CHILI, then the last letter L vs I? 
        Feedback: position 1: C ✓, position 2: H ✓, position 3: I ✓, position 4: L ✓, position 5: L -> but the word has I? So if the word is CHILI, then L at position 5 is absent? So we get L(x) at position 5? 
        Then we know to try CHILI? 

Similarly, if we guess ""CHILI"" and it's wrong, we get I(x) at position 5? Then we try CHILL.

But we have 3 guesses left? So it's safe? 

Alternatively, to maximize information? We don't have much to test? We already have all positions fixed except the last one? And we know the letter is either L or I? 

Also, if we guess ""CHILL"", we also test if L can be duplicated? But since we know L is at position 4, we are testing if there is an additional L at position 5? 

But I think we can guess ""CHILL"" now? 

But note: we have two candidates? 

Let me choose ""CHILL"" as the guess? 

But why? Because L is more common as a last letter? Or arbitrarily? 

Since we cannot get additional information without guessing one? 

We'll guess ""CHILL"". 

If it works, we win; if not, we know it's ""CHILI"".

Alternatively, we can guess a word that includes both possibilities? But we don't? 

For example, to test if there's a duplicate I? But we don't know? 

But we don't need to? We can just guess one candidate? 

So guess ""chill""? 

But let's output: ""chill""

Response would be: <guess>chill</guess>### Analysis of Feedback:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  - Position 1 is **C**, and **R, A, N, E** are absent.  
- **Guess 2: ""coils"" → Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)**  
  - Position 3 is **I**, position 4 is **L**, and **O, S** are absent.  
- **Guess 3: ""child"" → Feedback: C(✓)✓) I(✓) L(✓)✓)**  
  - Position 2 is **H**, and **D** is absent.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **C**  
   - Position 2: **H**  
   - Position 3: **I**  
   - Position 4: **L**  
   - The word structure is **C H I L _**.  

2. **Absent letters**:  
   - **R, A, N, E, O, S, D** cannot appear (eliminated from feedback).  

3. **Possible words for position 5**:  
   - Only letters not eliminated are viable: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, or duplicates of existing letters (like **I** or **L**).  
   - Common English words fitting **C H I L _** are:  
     - **CHILL** (ends with **L**)  
     - **CHILI** (ends with **I**)  
   - Both are valid, and no other common words match.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Goal**: Test the most likely candidate first.  
- **Why ""chill""?**  
  - **CHILL** prioritizes a consonant (less common than vowels) for potential elimination.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on position 5 will confirm the letter (e.g., if **L** is marked absent, the word must be **CHILI**).  
- **Efficiency**:  
  - 1 guess to win if correct.  
  - 1 additional guess max if incorrect, with 2 tries remaining.

The word starts with C, and does not contain R, A, N, E.\n\n Let\'s think about possible words that start with C and avoid the letters R,A,N,E.\n\n Since we have only one correct letter so far, we want to use this guess to get more information about the other letters.\n\n We should choose a word that:\n 1. Starts with C (since position 1 is fixed as C).\n 2. Uses new letters that we haven\'t tried yet to maximize information.\n\n Avoid using any of the disallowed letters: R, A, N, E.\n\n Available letters: We can use letters from the rest of the alphabet excluding R,A,N,E.\n\n We also want to cover common letters. Common consonants might be T, L, S, etc., and vowels might be I, O, U (since E,A are out).\n\n Let me try to think of a word that starts with C and has other common letters.\n\n Some possibilities: \n - Could try words like ""C"" + a combination of T, L, S, H, O, I, U, etc.\n\n Examples: \n   ""CHILL"", but we have 5 letters and ""CHILL"" is 5 letters? Let\'s check: C-H-I-L-L -> but it has L repeated? Actually, ""CHILL"" is C-H-I-L-L, so yes. However, repeated L might not be ideal for information.\n   ""CLIMB"" -> C, L, I, M, B -> only unique letters? Yes.\n\n Let me list some words:\n   ""COULD"" -> contains O, U, L, D -> but O and U are vowels? Actually, we don\'t know about vowels yet except that A and E are not present.\n   ""C"" followed by other popular letters: T, L, S, H, O, I, U, etc.\n\n We have already eliminated 4 letters: R, A, N, E. So we have 22 letters left.\n\n Since we need to maximize information, we should try to include letters that are frequent in 5-letter words.\n\n According to English letter frequency, after the top letters we\'ve excluded, we have: \n   E (excluded), A (excluded), then common ones: T, O, I, S, H, etc.\n\n But without E and A, we have T, O, I, S, H, R (but R is excluded) -> R is excluded? Yes, in our feedback R was x, meaning absent.\n\n So possible words: \n   ""COST"" is only 4 letters, so no.\n   ""CLOUD"" -> C L O U D -> contains O and U (vowels) and L, D. This might be good because it introduces new vowels and consonants.\n\n   ""CHIST""? That\'s not a word. \n   ""CHISL""? Not a word.\n\n   ""COULY""? Not a common word.\n\n   ""COILS"" -> C, O, I, L, S: all unique and new? But we don\'t know about S. Also, we haven\'t tried S, O, I, L.\n\n   ""CIVIL"" -> C, I, V, I, L -> but repeated I? Actually, \'I\' appears twice? Spelling ""civil"" has two I\'s? Position 2 and 4? Actually, word: C-I-V-I-L -> that\'s one I? Wait: C-I-V-I-L? No, it\'s C-I-V-I-L? Actually, it has two I\'s. Positions: 2 and 4. So repeated letter? Not ideal.\n\n   ""CHOMP"" -> C, H, O, M, P. All unique? Yes.\n\n   ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S. This might be good? But note we have S.\n\n   ""CURLY"" -> but contains R -> disallowed? We cannot use R.\n\n   Let me think: avoid R,A,N,E.\n\n   Some candidates:\n   - ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D.\n   - ""CHOPD""? Not a word.\n   - ""CHOPS"": C, H, O, P, S -> valid word? Yes.\n\n   ""CHOPS"": meaning to cut. So ""CHOPS"" is acceptable.\n\n   Another: ""CLOMP""? Not common, but valid? However, not as common as ""CHOPS"".\n\n   ""COVER"": but contains E -> E is disallowed.\n\n   ""QUA?"" -> not starting with C.\n\n   ""C"" and then try to get information about vowels? We know the word doesn\'t have A or E, so vowels must be O, I, U? Or none? But most English words have vowels.\n\n   Alternatively, ""SPLIT"" -> doesn\'t start with C.\n\n   We need words starting with C.\n\n   Let me think of common words: \n      ""COULD"" -> uses O, U, L, D -> but U and O?\n      ""COAST"" -> but has A -> disallowed? A is excluded.\n\n   ""COAST"" contains A -> so we cannot use A. Hence invalid.\n\n   ""CHART"" -> contains A -> disallowed.\n\n   ""CUT"" -> too short.\n\n   ""CUBIC""? That has two C\'s? But we already know the first letter is C. The word might have another C? Our feedback for first guess didn\'t say anything about duplicate C? But we didn\'t have a duplicate. Now, it\'s possible? Yes.\n\n   However, to maximize new letters, we might avoid repeating C? But since we only have one C so far? But we don\'t know if there are duplicates.\n\n   Let me choose a word that avoids duplication and avoids the disallowed letters.\n\n   Words: \n      ""COMBS"" -> C, O, M, B, S -> unique letters? Yes? But ""COMBS"" is a word? Yes (noun meaning the bees\' home or verb meaning to groom hair?).\n\n   ""COMET"" -> but E is disallowed.\n\n   ""COMIC"" -> but repeated C? We know position 1 is C, so we would put C at position 1 again? Then the word starts with C. The other C? At position 4? We don\'t know if that would be correct. But also it has I.\n\n   Let me consider: \n   Criteria: We want to test vowels? Since we\'ve eliminated E and A, we could try O and I? Or U?\n\n   ""COINS"" -> O and I? But contains I, O, N? Wait: does ""COINS"" contain N? COINS: C, O, I, N, S -> but N is disallowed? We know N is not in the word.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid N.\n\n   So ""COINS"" is invalid because of N.\n\n   ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S -> all new? And no A, E, N, R? Yes.\n\n   Let\'s try ""CHOPS"": \n      If the word is ""CHOPS"" itself? Then we win? But we don\'t know yet.\n\n   If not, we can get feedback on H, O, P, S.\n\n   Alternatively, ""CLOUD"" -> C, L, O, U, D -> also good? But U is less common.\n\n   Let me prioritize letters that are more common. Without E, A, R, N, what are the next common? \n   After E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S -> but R, A, N are out -> then common: I, O, T, S.\n\n   So I, O, T, S are good.\n\n   Now, we have positions 2-5: unknown.\n\n   We are trying: \n      Option 1: ""CHOPS"": uses H, O, P, S -> note: H is not among the top? Well, H is common. \n      Option 2: ""COSTS"" -> but repeated S? Not ideal.\n\n   ""COILS"": C, O, I, L, S -> avoids E, A, R, N? Yes. And uses O, I, L, S? L is common.\n\n   So ""COILS"" is a word? Yes, meaning wires wound in a spiral.\n\n   Let me compare ""CHOPS"" and ""COILS"". Both are valid.\n\n   Which one covers more frequent letters?\n\n   Among O, I: O and I are vowel-like. Then L vs H? L is more common than H? \n   Letter frequency: \n        O: 4th? (without E,A,R) -> actually in English, E,A,R,I,O,T,N,S are top. We have R,A,N,E out? So top remaining: I, O, T, S.\n\n   ""CHOPS"": H, O, P, S -> O and S are very common. P is somewhat common? \n   ""COILS"": O, I, L, S -> I, O, S are common? L is also common? Actually L is 12th overall? \n\n   Both include O and S.\n\n   Now, we want to avoid the possibility that we run into duplicates? \n\n   Since we don\'t know if the word has duplicates? We are free to use duplicates? However, for maximum information, unique letters are better.\n\n   Both are unique? \n      ""CHOPS"" -> C, H, O, P, S: unique? C is at start? We are introducing H,O,P,S -> all distinct? Yes.\n      ""COILS"" -> C, O, I, L, S: distinct? Yes.\n\n   ""COILS"" introduces I and L? Which I haven\'t tried? And O and S. While ""CHOPS"" introduces H and P? \n\n   But H and P are less common than I and L? Because I is a vowel and more common? \n\n   According to letter frequency in English:\n      I: about 6.9% \n      O: 7.5%\n      L: 4%\n      S: 6.3%\n      H: 6%\n      P: 1.9%\n\n   So ""COILS"" has I (6.9%), O (7.5%), L (4%), S (6.3%)? Total? But we don\'t count the fixed C? Actually, we are only concerned about the new positions? \n\n   Overall, ""COILS"" provides letters: O (common), I (common), L (medium), S (common). \n   ""CHOPS"" provides: H (about 6%), O (common), P (less common), S (common).\n\n   Therefore, I think ""COILS"" covers more of the common remaining letters? Because H (6%) vs I (almost 7%)? And P is 1.9% vs L at 4%. \n\n   So ""COILS"" might be slightly better? Especially because L is more common than P.\n\n   Moreover, we are testing two vowels? The word must have vowels? Since we know E and A are out? So O and I are good candidates.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""COILS"".\n\n   Second guess: ""coils""\n\n   So the guessed word: <guess>coils</guess><reasoning>\nBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- The letter ""C"" is correct and in position 1 (marked ✓).\n- The letters ""R"", ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are not in the word (marked x).\n\nKey implications:\n1. The correct word starts with ""C"".\n2. The word contains none of these letters: R, A, N, E.\n3. We need to probe remaining letters to identify possibilities.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must start with ""C"" to preserve the known position-1 letter.\n- Avoid using R, A, N, E.\n- Use common English letters not yet tested to maximize information gain.\n- Prioritize unique letters with high frequency (since duplicates reduce information).\n\nOptimal strategy:\n- Focus on common remaining consonants (like L, S, T, H) and vowels (O, I, U).\n- Avoid reusing eliminated letters.\n\nSelected word: **""COILS""**\n- Starts with ""C"" as required.\n- Uses new letters: O, I, L, S (all untested and high frequency).\n- Avoids disallowed letters (no R, A, N, E).\n- Maximizes information potential: Covers two vowels (O, I) and two common consonants (L, S).\n</reasoning>\n\n<guess>coils</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: coils -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n  - C is correct and in position 1.\n  - R, A, N, E are absent.\n\nGuess 2: ""coils"" -> Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)\n  - C is correct and in position 1 (as we already knew).\n  - O is absent (so the word does not contain O).\n  - I is correct and in position 3? Let\'s see: \n        Position: 1:C, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:S\n    So I is in position 3 and correct (✓).\n  - L is correct and in position 4 (since it\'s the 4th letter and marked ✓).\n  - S is absent.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The word starts with C (position 1).\n- Position 3 is I.\n- Position 4 is L.\n- The word does not contain: R, A, N, E, O, S. (from the x\'s in both guesses)\n- The word does contain I and L, but we already have their positions.\n\nAlso, note that in ""coils"", the O and S were absent, so we add O and S to the absent letters.\n\nCurrent known:\n  Position 1: C\n  Position 2: ? (unknown, but cannot be O, R, A, N, E, S)\n  Position 3: I\n  Position 4: L\n  Position 5: ? (unknown, but cannot be O, R, A, N, E, S)\n\nWe also know the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.\n\nNow, what letters are possible for position 2 and 5?\nWe have eliminated: R, A, N, E, O, S.\n\nSo the available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: we have I and L in the word, but they are already placed. So we don\'t need to test them again? Actually, we don\'t know if they appear again? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates? However, in the feedback for ""coils"", we had I and L marked correct, but if there were duplicates, we might not know? But in Wordle, if a letter appears only once and you use it twice, one might be marked as absent? But in this case, we didn\'t use duplicates.\n\nBut we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we don\'t have any indication so far.\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that fits:\n  C _ I L _\n\nAnd the missing letters (position 2 and 5) must be from the available set.\n\nWe also want to maximize information? But we have two positions to fill. We might be able to guess the word? Or we can try to test more letters.\n\nBut note: we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess? We have 6 tries total, so we have 4 left? But we might get it.\n\nLet\'s think of possible words that fit the pattern: C _ I L _\n\nWith the constraints on the missing letters.\n\nPossible letters for position 2: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\nPosition 5: same set? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know.\n\nCommon words that fit:\n  ""CHILL"": C H I L L -> but we have L at position 4 and then L at position 5? So duplicate L? And we know L is in position 4, so if we put L at position 5, it might be correct? But we don\'t know if L is duplicated? Also, in our second guess, we had L at position 4 and it was correct, but we didn\'t have L at position 5? So if the word has two L\'s, then in ""coils"" we only had one L? Then the feedback for the L in position 4 would be correct, but we wouldn\'t know about the other L? Actually, in Wordle, if the word has two L\'s and you guess one L in the correct position and no other L, then the feedback would only show one L as correct? But if you guess a word with one L and the word has two, then the feedback might not indicate the missing one? Actually, the feedback only tells you about the letters you guessed? So if the word has two L\'s and you only guess one, then you won\'t know about the second one? \n\nBut in this case, we are trying to guess the word. We have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, without evidence, we might assume no duplicates? But we can\'t.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words:\n\n  ""CHILL"": C H I L L -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L -> but we have position 4 as L, and then position 5 as L? But we don\'t know if L is duplicated? Also, H is allowed? And we haven\'t tested H? But in the second guess, we didn\'t use H? So H is a possibility.\n\n  ""CHILD"": C H I L D -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:D -> this is a valid word? Yes.\n\n  ""CIVIL"": C I V I L -> but wait, position 3 is I? But in ""CIVIL"", position 2 is I? Then position 3 is V? But we have position 3 fixed as I? So ""CIVIL"" would be: C (1), I (2), V (3), I (4), L (5) -> but we need position 3 to be I? In ""CIVIL"", position 3 is V, not I? So it doesn\'t fit? Because we have position 3 fixed as I? So ""CIVIL"" is not matching.\n\n  ""BUILD""? Doesn\'t start with C.\n\n  ""CLIMB"": C L I M B -> but we have position 4 as L? In ""CLIMB"": position 1:C, 2:L, 3:I, 4:M, 5:B -> but we need position 4 to be L? So it doesn\'t match.\n\n  We need position 3 to be I and position 4 to be L? So the pattern is: C (letter2) I L (letter5)\n\n  Other words:\n    ""CHILI""? But that\'s 5 letters? C-H-I-L-I -> positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:L, 5:I -> so it fits? But we have two I\'s? And we know I is in position 3? Then position 5 is I? So that\'s possible? But we haven\'t tested I in position 5? And we don\'t know if I can be duplicated? Also, in the second guess, we had I only at position 3? So if the word has two I\'s, we wouldn\'t know? \n\n  ""CHILL"" and ""CHILI"" and ""CHILD"" are candidates.\n\n  Also, ""CIVIL"" doesn\'t fit because position 3 is V, not I? But we have position 3 fixed as I.\n\n  ""TRAIL""? But T and R? R is excluded? And doesn\'t start with C.\n\n  ""FLAIL""? Doesn\'t start with C and has A? A is excluded.\n\n  ""QUAIL""? Same.\n\n  So let\'s list possible words that start with C, have I at position 3, L at position 4, and the second letter and fifth letter from the allowed set.\n\n  For position 2: we have many options: H, T, U, V, W, etc.\n\n  Common words:\n    - CHILL\n    - CHILD\n    - CHILI\n    - CRILL? Not a word.\n    - CVILL? Not a word.\n\n  Also, ""CECIL""? But C is at position 1 and then E? But E is excluded? So no.\n\n  ""COLIC""? But O is excluded? And we have position 3 as I? ""COLIC"": C O L I C -> but position 3 is L? Not I? So doesn\'t fit.\n\n  ""CUBIC""? C U B I C -> but position 3 is B? Not I? So no.\n\n  ""CIVIC""? C I V I C -> position 1:C, 2:I, 3:V, 4:I, 5:C -> but we need position 3 to be I? It\'s V? So no.\n\n  So the main candidates are: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI.\n\n  Also, ""CHIRL""? Not a word.\n\n  ""CHIRP""? But then position 4 would be R? But we need L at position 4? And R is excluded? So no.\n\n  ""CHIRL"" not a word.\n\n  ""CHIRM""? Not common? And position 4 would be R? No.\n\n  So we have:\n    CHILL: C H I L L\n    CHILD: C H I L D\n    CHILI: C H I L I\n\n  Also, ""CHIEL""? But E is excluded? And position 5 is L? But we have position 4 as L? So ""CHIEL"" would be C H I E L -> but E is excluded? And position 4 is E? But we need L at position 4? So no.\n\n  ""CHIRK""? But R is excluded? And position 4 would be R? No.\n\n  ""CHIRT""? Same.\n\n  ""CHIVE""? But E is excluded? And position 5 is E? No.\n\n  ""CHIMP""? But position 4 would be M? Not L? So no.\n\n  So the only common words I can think of are: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI.\n\n  Now, we have to choose one? But we don\'t know which one? We have to test.\n\n  We can try to guess one of them? But if we guess wrong, we get feedback and then we can guess again? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can try.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions to fill? And we know the pattern? So we might as well guess one of the candidates? But which one?\n\n  But note: we haven\'t tested the letter H? In the second guess we didn\'t use H? So we don\'t know if H is in the word? But in the pattern, position 2 is H in all these candidates? So if we guess a word that doesn\'t have H? But we don\'t have any candidate without H? So we must test H? Actually, if we guess one of these, we will find out about H? Because if the word is CHILL, then H is present? But if we guess CHILL and the word is CHILD, then we get feedback that H is correct? But we already know that? Because we are putting H in position 2? And if it\'s correct, then we get H(✓) and then we know? But we also get the last letter? \n\n  However, we have three candidates: \n      CHILL: last letter L -> but we already know L is in the word? But if we guess CHILL, then the last letter L? We don\'t know if it\'s correct? But we know position 4 is L? So if we put L at position 5, it might be correct? Or not? \n\n  But in the feedback for ""coils"", we had L at position 4 correct? But we don\'t know if there is another L? So if we guess CHILL, and the word is CHILL, then we get all correct? If the word is CHILD, then we get: \n        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(?) -> but the last letter is L? But the word is CHILD, so last letter is D? So the last L would be absent? And we get feedback: L at position 5 is absent? Then we know it\'s not CHILL? Then we can guess CHILD? \n\n  Similarly, if we guess CHILD and the word is CHILL, then we get: \n        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> then we know the last letter is not D? Then we can guess CHILL? \n\n  But we have only two positions to fill? And we are testing the last letter? \n\n  Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn\'t have H? But then we can test if H is present? But we don\'t have a candidate without H? So we must test H? \n\n  But note: we can also test multiple letters? For example, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a different last letter? But we don\'t know the last letter? \n\n  However, we have three candidates? We can try to guess a word that is not one of the candidates? But that might not be efficient? \n\n  Let me think: we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, or I? But we don\'t know? \n\n  But we want to maximize information? We have two unknowns: \n      - Is H in the word? (but in the pattern, position 2 must be H? because all candidates have H? So if we don\'t put H, then we might not get the word? But we don\'t know if H is the only possibility? \n\n  Actually, are there other words? For example, ""CVILL"" is not a word? ""CWHIL""? Not a word? ""CZHIL""? No? \n\n  What about ""CABIL""? But A is excluded? \n\n  ""CEDIL""? E excluded? \n\n  ""CFILM""? Not a word? \n\n  ""CHIRL""? Not a word? \n\n  So it seems the only common words are CHILL, CHILD, CHILI? \n\n  But wait, ""CHILI"" has two I\'s? So if we guess ""CHILI"", then we have I at position 3 and 5? \n\n  Now, we haven\'t tested for duplicate I? In the second guess, we had I at position 3? And we don\'t know if there is another I? \n\n  So the candidates are:\n      CHILL: C H I L L\n      CHILD: C H I L D\n      CHILI: C H I L I\n\n  We can try to guess one of them? \n\n  But we have 4 guesses? So we can try one? \n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the last letter? But we don\'t have a word that covers multiple? \n\n  But note: we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, or I? But that might not be a word? \n\n  For example, ""CHIRP""? But R is excluded? \n\n  ""CHINK""? But N is excluded? \n\n  ""CHIMP""? But M? And position 4 would be M? But we need L at position 4? So we cannot change position 4? \n\n  We have to keep position 3 as I and position 4 as L? \n\n  So we are forced to have the pattern: C H I L ? \n\n  And the last letter must be one of: L, D, I? (from the candidates) but also other possibilities? But we don\'t have other common words? \n\n  What about ""CHIEL""? But E excluded? \n\n  ""CHIRL""? Not a word? \n\n  ""CHIZZ""? Not a word? \n\n  ""CHIVY""? But V? And E? Excluded? \n\n  So I think the only common words are the three: CHILL, CHILD, CHILI. \n\n  Now, we can try to guess ""CHILL"" first? \n\n  If it\'s correct, we win? \n\n  If not, we get feedback: \n      If the word is CHILD: \n          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(x) -> because the last letter is D, not L? \n      Then we know the last letter is not L? So we can try CHILD? \n\n      If the word is CHILI: \n          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(?) -> but the last letter of CHILI is I? So we have L at position 5? But the word has I at position 5? So L would be absent? Then we get: L(x) at position 5? Then we know it\'s not CHILL? Then we can try CHILI? \n\n  But wait, if we guess CHILL and the word is CHILI, we get:\n        Position 1: C ✓\n        Position 2: H ✓ (if H is correct? But in CHILI, position 2 is H? So H is correct? \n        Position 3: I ✓\n        Position 4: L ✓\n        Position 5: L -> but the word has I at position 5? So L is not present? Because the word CHILI has only one L? At position 4? So the L at position 5 is absent? So we get: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(x)\n\n  Then we know the last letter is not L? So we can try CHILD? But if we try CHILD and the word is CHILI, then we get:\n        C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> because last letter is I, not D? \n        Then we know it\'s not CHILD? Then we try CHILI? \n\n  So we might need two more guesses? \n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the last letter without committing to H? But we don\'t have a word? \n\n  Or we can try a word that has a different second letter? But we don\'t know any other second letter? \n\n  But wait, is it possible that the second letter is not H? We assumed it must be H? But are there other words? \n\n  Let me double-check: \n      Pattern: C _ I L _ \n      With the missing letters not in {R, A, N, E, O, S}\n\n  Other words? \n      ""CUTIN""? But position 4 is I? Not L? \n      ""CIVIL"" we already saw doesn\'t fit? \n      ""CLIFT""? But position 2 is L? Then position 3 is I? Position 4 is F? Not L? \n      ""CLINT""? But N is excluded? \n      ""CLIPT""? Not a word? \n      ""CULCH""? But position 3 is L? Not I? \n      ""CULTI""? C U L T I -> position 3 is L? Not I? \n      ""CURIO""? But O is excluded? \n      ""CURVY""? But position 3 is R? Excluded? \n      ""CWTCH""? Not a word? \n      ""CYCLO""? O excluded? \n\n  What about ""CHIRP""? Not? \n\n  ""CHIPS""? But S is excluded? And position 4 is P? Not L? \n\n  So I think H is the only possibility for position 2? \n\n  Therefore, we must have H at position 2? \n\n  Then the word is C H I L ? \n\n  And the last letter must be one of: L, D, I? \n\n  Now, we can try to guess ""CHILD"" because it has a different last letter? \n\n  But we don\'t know? \n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, I? But that would not be a candidate? And we might waste a guess? \n\n  But we can try to test multiple letters? For example, we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then in the last position, we put a letter that is common? But we don\'t know? \n\n  However, we have only three candidates? So we can try one? \n\n  Let me choose ""CHILD"" as the guess? Because it has a D? And we haven\'t tested D? \n\n  If we guess ""CHILD"": \n      If the word is CHILD: we win? \n      If the word is CHILL: we get feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> then we know the last letter is not D? So we try CHILL? \n      If the word is CHILI: we get feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) -> same as above? Then we know it\'s not D? Then we try CHILI? \n\n  But wait, if we get D(x) for both CHILL and CHILI? Then we don\'t know which one? Because both CHILL and CHILI have last letter not D? So we would have to try both? \n\n  Actually, if we guess ""CHILD"" and the word is CHILL, we get D(x) and then we know the last letter is not D? Then we try CHILL? \n  If we guess ""CHILD"" and the word is CHILI, we get D(x) and then we try CHILI? \n\n  But we don\'t know which one? So we might need to try both? \n\n  Alternatively, we can try ""CHILI"": \n      If the word is CHILI: win? \n      If the word is CHILL: we get last letter L? But wait, in ""CHILI"", we have I at position 5? But the word CHILL has L at position 5? So we get: \n          C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) I(?) -> for CHILL, the last letter is L? So the I at position 5 is absent? Because CHILL has only one I? At position 3? So we get I(x) at position 5? \n      Then we know the last letter is not I? So we try CHILL? \n      If the word is CHILD: we get I(x) at position 5? Then we know the last letter is not I? So we try CHILD? \n\n  But again, we don\'t know which one? \n\n  So in either case, if we guess one candidate and it\'s wrong, we get the last letter wrong? And then we know to try the other two? But we have two left? Then we can try one of the remaining two? \n\n  Since we have 4 guesses left? We can do: \n      Guess 3: CHILD \n      If correct, done.\n      If not, then we get feedback: \n          If the word is CHILL: we get D(x) -> then we know to try CHILL next? \n          If the word is CHILI: we get D(x) -> then we know to try CHILI next? \n      Then guess 4: either CHILL or CHILI? But we don\'t know which one? \n\n  But we don\'t know which one? So we have to choose arbitrarily? \n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that is not a candidate? But that tests the last letter? \n\n  For example, we can try a word that has the same pattern but with a different last letter? But we don\'t know? \n\n  But we can try a word that has H in position 2? And then a letter that is not L, D, I? But that might not be a word? \n\n  For example, ""CHIRP"" is not allowed? \n\n  ""CHIMB""? Not a word? \n\n  ""CHIMP""? But then position 4 would be M? But we have to keep position 4 as L? \n\n  We cannot change position 4? \n\n  So we are stuck? \n\n  Another idea: we can try a word that has the same pattern but with a letter that we haven\'t used? For example, ""CHIML""? Not a word? \n\n  Or ""CHUGL""? Not a word? \n\n  So I think we have to guess one of the candidates? \n\n  Let me choose ""CHILD"" as the third guess? \n\n  If it\'s correct, we win? \n\n  If not, we get feedback that the last letter is not D? Then we have two options: CHILL and CHILI? \n\n  Then we can try ""CHILL"" next? If it\'s not, then it must be ""CHILI""? \n\n  But we have 4 guesses? So we can do that? \n\n  Alternatively, we can try to test for duplicate I? But how? \n\n  We can try a word that has I at position 5? But we don\'t have a word that has I at position 5 and H at position 2? But ""CHILI"" does? But that\'s a candidate? \n\n  Or we can try a word that has I at a different position? But we don\'t know? \n\n  For example, we can try ""DUTCH""? But doesn\'t start with C? \n\n  ""PITCH""? But position 1 is P? \n\n  We need to start with C? \n\n  ""C"" and then a word that has I at position 5? But we have position 3 fixed as I? So if we put I at position 5, then we have two I\'s? \n\n  For example, ""CUBIC""? But position 3 is B? Not I? \n\n  ""CIVIC""? But position 3 is V? \n\n  ""CONIC""? O excluded? \n\n  ""CYNIC""? But position 3 is N? Excluded? \n\n  ""CURVY""? Not? \n\n  So I think it\'s not easy to test for duplicate I? \n\n  Therefore, I will go with ""CHILD"" as the third guess? \n\n  But let\'s see the feedback we have: we know position 1,3,4 are fixed? And position 2 must be H? And position 5 is unknown? \n\n  So I\'ll guess ""CHILD"". \n\n  But note: in the feedback for ""coils"", we had S absent? But in ""CHILD"", there is no S? So that\'s fine? \n\n  So guess: ""child""\n\n  But wait, we have to output in the format.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try to think of a word that tests more letters? But we have only two positions? And one of them we are confident is H? \n\n  So I think it\'s acceptable to guess ""CHILD"". \n\n  If we are wrong, we get information about the last letter? \n\n  So let\'s do that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  \n  - **C** is correct and in position 1.  \n  - **R, A, N, E** are absent from the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""coils"" → Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)**  \n  - **C** is correct (position 1, already known).  \n  - **O** is absent.  \n  - **I** is correct and in position 3.  \n  - **L** is correct and in position 4.  \n  - **S** is absent.  \n\n### Key Insights\n1. **Fixed positions**:  \n   - Position 1: **C**  \n   - Position 3: **I**  \n   - Position 4: **L**  \n   - The word structure is: **C _ I L _** (only positions 2 and 5 are unknown).  \n\n2. **Absent letters**:  \n   - **R, A, N, E, O, S** cannot appear anywhere in the word.  \n\n3. **Possible letters for positions 2 and 5**:  \n   - Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n   - Available vowels (since E, A, O are out): I, U (but I is already used at position 3; duplicates are possible).  \n\n4. **Candidate words**:  \n   - After eliminating invalid letters, common English words fitting **C _ I L _** are:  \n     - **CHILL** (C H I L L)  \n     - **CHILD** (C H I L D)  \n     - **CHILI** (C H I L I)  \n   - All candidates share **H** in position 2.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3\n- **Goal**: Test the variable position 5 (last letter) while confirming **H** in position 2.  \n- **Why ""child""?**  \n  - It tests **H** in position 2 (common to all candidates).  \n  - It tests **D** in position 5 (which, if absent, eliminates **CHILD** and narrows to **CHILL** or **CHILI**).  \n  - If correct, we solve the puzzle.

We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""chill"":
Feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(-)

Interpretation:
- The first four letters are correct: C at position 1, H at position 2, I at position 3, L at position 4.
- The fifth letter L is marked with (-), meaning that L is in the word but in the wrong position.

But note: we already have an L at position 4, which is correct. The feedback for the fifth letter L is (-), meaning there is another L in the word, but not at position 5.

Therefore, the word must have at least two L's: one at position 4 and one at another position? But the only positions left are 2 and 5? But position 2 is H, which is correct? So the second L must be at position 5? But the feedback says it's not at position 5? Contradiction?

Wait, let me reexamine:

The word structure we have so far: positions 1,2,3,4 are fixed as C,H,I,L. So the word is ""C H I L ?"".

We guessed ""CHILL"", which is ""C H I L L"". The feedback for the fifth letter is L(-), meaning that L is present in the word but not at position 5.

But we already know that L is at position 4? So if the word has only one L, then the L at position 5 would be absent? But the feedback says it's present but wrong position? That implies there must be a second L in the word? But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5? And positions 1,2,3,4 are fixed? So the second L must be at position 5? But the feedback says it's not at position 5? That's impossible.

Alternatively, the feedback might be interpreted as: the letter L is in the word but not in position 5? But we have an L at position 4? So the L at position 5 is a duplicate? And the feedback (-) for the fifth letter means that there is an L in the word (which we already know from position 4) but it is not at position 5? That makes sense? Because the duplicate L at position 5 is not correct? But the feedback symbol (-) typically means the letter is present but in the wrong position? However, in the case of duplicates, it can be tricky.

In Wordle, if the word has one L and you guess two L's, then:
- The L that is in the correct position (position 4) gets a ✓.
- The extra L (position 5) would get an x? Because the word only has one L? But in this feedback, it's (-)? So that would imply the word has two L's? But then one is at position 4 (correct) and the other should be at position 5? But the feedback says the position 5 L is not correct? So it must be in a different position? But we have no other positions? 

Wait, the word is only 5 letters? And positions 1,2,3 are fixed as C,H,I? So the only positions for the second L would be position 5? But if the word has two L's, then position 5 must be L? But the feedback says it's not? So that's a contradiction.

Therefore, the only logical explanation is that the word does not have two L's? But then why is the fifth letter L marked as (-)? That would be inconsistent.

Perhaps I misinterpreted the feedback? Let me read the feedback again:

Guess 4: chill -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(-)

This means:
- The first C is correct (position 1).
- The second H is correct (position 2).
- The third I is correct (position 3).
- The fourth L is correct (position 4).
- The fifth L is marked as (-), meaning it is present in the word but in the wrong position.

But if the word has the first four letters as C,H,I,L, then the fifth letter must be something else? And if the word has an L at position 5? Then it would be correct? But it's marked as (-), meaning wrong position? So the word cannot have L at position 5? But it must have an L at position 4? And if there is another L, it must be at position 5? But that's the only position left? 

Unless the word has an L in a position we haven't guessed? But we have fixed positions 1,2,3,4? So the only position left is 5? 

This is confusing.

Another possibility: the feedback for the fifth letter is (-) because the word has an L that is not at position 4? But we already have a ✓ for the L at position 4? So that L is accounted for? Then the fifth L is an extra? And if the word has only one L, then the fifth L should be marked x? But it's marked (-)? So the word must have two L's? But then the second L must be at position 5? But it's marked (-) meaning not at position 5? 

This is a paradox.

Perhaps the feedback is: the fifth letter L is present in the word but not at position 5? But the word has the L at position 4? So the fifth L is a duplicate? And the feedback (-) indicates that there is another L somewhere else? But in the word, the only L is at position 4? So the duplicate L in the guess is not in the word? But then it should be x? 

I think there might be a misunderstanding of the feedback system.

Let me recall the rules:

- ✓: The letter is in the word and in the correct position.
- -: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- x: The letter is not in the word.

In the case of duplicate letters:

If the word has one L and you guess two L's:
- If one of them is in the correct position, it gets ✓.
- The other L, if the word has only one L, gets x? Or if the word has two L's, then the other L might get - if it's in the wrong position? Or if it's in the correct position, it gets ✓.

But in this case, the word has one L at position 4? Then:
- The L at position 4 in the guess gets ✓.
- The L at position 5 in the guess is extra? So it should be x? Because the word has no second L.

But the feedback says L(-) for position 5? That would imply the word has a second L? But then where is it? The only positions are 1,2,3,4,5? And 1,2,3 are C,H,I? So the second L must be at position 5? But then it should be ✓? Not (-)? 

Unless the word is not what we think? 

Perhaps the fixed positions are not all correct? But the feedback says C(✓), H(✓), I(✓), L(✓) for the first four? So they are fixed.

The only possibility is that the word has two L's: one at position 4 and one at position 5? But then the fifth letter should be ✓? But it's marked (-)? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the feedback for the fifth letter is (-) because the letter L is in the word but not at position 5? But if the word has two L's, one at position 4 and one at position 5, then the fifth letter should be correct? 

I think there might be a mistake in the feedback or in our reasoning.

Let me reexamine the feedback from guess 2 and 3.

Guess 2: ""coils"" -> C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)
This means:
- C at position 1: correct.
- O at position 2: absent.
- I at position 3: correct.
- L at position 4: correct.
- S at position 5: absent.

So positions 1,3,4 are fixed: C, I, L.

Guess 3: ""child"" -> C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x)
This means:
- C at position 1: correct.
- H at position 2: correct? So position 2 is H.
- I at position 3: correct.
- L at position 4: correct.
- D at position 5: absent.

So after guess 3, we have the word as C H I L ? and D is absent.

Then guess 4: ""chill"" -> C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(-)

The feedback for the fifth letter is L(-), which means that L is in the word but not at position 5.

But we already have an L at position 4? So the word must have at least two L's? But then the second L must be at position 5? But the feedback says it's not at position 5? Contradiction.

Unless the word has an L at a position that is not 4 or 5? But positions 1,2,3 are fixed as C,H,I? So no room for another L? 

The only possibility is that the feedback for the fifth letter is (-) because the letter L is present in the word (at position 4) but the duplicate L in the guess at position 5 is not in the word? But then it should be marked x? 

I think there is a misunderstanding in the feedback notation.

Perhaps the feedback for the fifth letter is (-) because the word has an L, but it's not at position 5? And since we already have an L at position 4, that is accounted for by the ✓, so the fifth L is a separate instance? And if the word has only one L, then the fifth L should be x? But it's not? 

This suggests that the word has two L's: one at position 4 and one at a different position? But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5? And 1,2,3 are C,H,I? So the second L must be at position 5? But then it should be ✓? 

I think there might be a mistake in the feedback provided.

Perhaps the feedback for ""chill"" is: the fifth letter L is marked as (-) because there is an L in the word that is not at position 5, but we already have one at position 4? So the feedback is indicating that there is another L somewhere? But there is no somewhere else? 

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""CHILL"", but the feedback for the fifth letter is (-) by mistake? Or perhaps the word has the letter L at position 2 or 3? But we have H at position 2 and I at position 3, both correct? 

Let me consider: is it possible that the word is not ""C H I L ?"" but something else? But the feedback from guess 3 says H is correct at position 2? So it must be.

Unless the feedback is not for the position? But the feedback format shows the letter and then the symbol, and we assume it's for the position? 

I think we have to accept the feedback as given.

So the feedback for ""chill"" is:
- C at position 1: ✓
- H at position 2: ✓
- I at position 3: ✓
- L at position 4: ✓
- L at position 5: -  (meaning this L is in the word but not at position 5)

This implies that the word has at least two L's: one at position 4 and one at a different position. But the only positions are 1,2,3,5? But positions 1,2,3 are C,H,I? So they cannot be L? Therefore, the only possibility is that the word has an L at position 5? But then it should be ✓? 

This is unresolvable.

Perhaps the feedback for position 4 L is not necessarily meaning that the letter at position 4 is L? But the feedback says L(✓) for the fourth letter, so it is.

I think there might be a flaw in the problem or in my understanding.

Let me try to think of a word that fits all feedback.

From guess 1: ""crane"" -> C is correct at position 1, R,A,N,E absent.
From guess 2: ""coils"" -> C correct, I correct at position 3, L correct at position 4, O and S absent.
From guess 3: ""child"" -> C correct, H correct at position 2, I correct, L correct, D absent.
From guess 4: ""chill"" -> C correct, H correct, I correct, L correct at position 4, and the fifth L is present but not at position 5.

So the word must have: 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: ? but not D, and not L? But the feedback says the fifth letter L is present but not at position 5? That means there is an L in the word that is not at position 4 or 5? But position 4 is L, so it must be at position 1,2,3? But position 1 is C, 2 is H, 3 is I, so none of them are L? 

Unless the word has more than two L's? But still, the positions are fixed.

The only possibility is that the feedback for the fifth letter is (-) because the word has an L, but it's already been found at position 4, and the fifth L is not in the word? But then it should be x? 

I think there is a mistake in the feedback or in the interpretation.

Perhaps the feedback symbol for the fifth letter is (-) but it is not for the letter L? No, the feedback is given as L(-), so it's for the letter L.

Another idea: in some interpretations, if the word has one L and you guess two L's, with one in the correct position, the second L might be marked as (-) if there is no second L? But that would be incorrect feedback? Or in some systems, it might be marked x.

I recall that in Wordle, for duplicate letters:
- If the word has one L, and you guess a word with two L's, then the first L (in the correct position) gets ✓, and the second L gets x.

But in this feedback, the second L gets (-), which would only happen if the word has a second L in a different position.

But in this case, there is no different position for the second L.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the word has an L at position 5? But then the feedback should be ✓ for the fifth letter? 

Perhaps the feedback for position 4 is not L? But it is marked ✓ for L.

I think we have to proceed with the feedback as given.

So, the feedback says for ""chill"": fifth letter L is present but not at position 5. This means there is an L in the word at a position that is not 5. But we already have an L at position 4, so that is accounted for. Therefore, the word must have a second L at one of the positions 1,2,3? But they are fixed as C,H,I? So it's impossible.

Unless the fixed letters are not all correct? But the feedback says they are correct.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 3: ""child"" -> H at position 2 is correct, but maybe it's not H at position 2? But the feedback says H(✓) for position 2.

I think there's a deadlock.

Perhaps the word is ""CHILL"", and the feedback for the fifth letter is (-) by error? Or perhaps in this version, the feedback for duplicates is handled differently.

Given the feedback, we must conclude that the word has two L's: one at position 4 and one at a position that is not 5? But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Since 1,2,3 are C,H,I, the second L must be at position 5? But then it should be correct.

I think we have to ignore the feedback for the fifth letter or assume it's a mistake.

Perhaps the fifth letter is not L in the word, but there is an L in the word at a different position? But there is no different position.

Another possibility: the word has an L at position 5, but the feedback for position 4 is for the letter L, but it might be that the word has L at position 5 and not at position 4? But the feedback for guess 2 and 3 both say L is correct at position 4.

In guess 2: ""coils"" has L at position 4 and it's correct.
In guess 3: ""child"" has L at position 4 and it's correct.
So position 4 is definitely L.

Therefore, the only way the feedback for guess 4's fifth letter being (-) makes sense is if the word has a second L at a position that is not 4 or 5? But there is no such position.

I think we must proceed by assuming that the word has two L's, and the second L is at position 5, but the feedback is misreported? Or perhaps in this system, the feedback for the fifth letter is (-) to indicate that there is an L in the word (at position 4) but it's not at position 5? But that would be redundant because we already know position 4 is L.

I think for the sake of progressing, we should consider that the word is ""CHILL"" and the feedback for the fifth letter should be ✓, but it's given as (-), so maybe it's a typo.

Perhaps the word is ""CHILI"", and the feedback for the fifth letter of ""chill"" is (-) because the letter L is in the word (at position 4) but not at position 5, and the fifth letter of the word is I, not L. So for the guess ""chill"", the fifth letter L is not in the word at all? But then it should be x? But it's (-)? 

If the word is ""CHILI"", then:
- Position 1: C ✓
- Position 2: H ✓
- Position 3: I ✓
- Position 4: L ✓
- Position 5: I (not L)

In the guess ""chill"", the fifth letter is L, which is not in the word because the word has only one L at position 4? So it should be x? But the feedback says (-), which is wrong.

If the word has two I's, then for ""chill"":
- The fifth letter L is not in the word? So x.

But the feedback says (-), so it must be that the letter L is in the word but not at position 5. But in ""CHILI"", there is an L at position 4, so the letter L is in the word, but not at position 5, so the feedback (-) for the fifth letter L is correct? Because it's present elsewhere.

In Wordle, for a guess with a duplicate letter:
- The correct letters in the correct position are marked ✓.
- Then, for letters that are in the word but not in the correct position, they are marked (-), but only if they are not already accounted for.

In ""CHILI"" (the word) and guess ""CHILL"":
- Position 1: C ✓
- Position 2: H ✓
- Position 3: I ✓
- Position 4: L ✓
- Position 5: L (guess) vs I (word): L is not in the word because the only L is already used at position 4? So it should be x.

However, in some interpretations, the feedback might be:
- The first L (position 4) is correct, so it gets ✓.
- The second L (position 5) is not in the word (because the word has only one L), so it gets x.

But in this feedback, it's given as (-), which would be incorrect for ""CHILI"".

For ""CHILL"" (the word) and guess ""CHILL"", the fifth letter should be ✓.

So the feedback provided is inconsistent.

Given the feedback, we must assume that the word has two L's: one at position 4 and one at a position that is not 5? But that's impossible.

Perhaps the word is ""CHILL"", and the feedback for the fifth letter is ✓, but it's written as (-) by mistake.

Or perhaps the word is ""CLIMB"" but then position 4 is M? But feedback says L is correct at position 4.

I think we have to make a guess based on the information.

We know:
- The word is C H I L ? 
- The fifth letter cannot be D (from guess 3), and cannot be R,A,N,E,O,S.
- From guess 4, the fifth letter L is marked as (-), which suggests that L is in the word but not at position 5. But since position 4 is L, it must be that the word has a second L, but there's no room, so perhaps the fifth letter is not L, but there is an L in the word (at position 4) and the fifth letter is something else that is not L.

But the feedback for the fifth letter is specifically for the letter L, and it says it is present but not at position 5. So the letter L is in the word, but not at position 5. We already know it's at position 4, so that's consistent, but it doesn't give new information about the fifth letter.

In fact, the fifth letter could be any letter except the eliminated ones, and not L? Because if it were L, it would be in the correct position and should be ✓, but it's not, it's (-), which is for wrong position, so it can't be L.

So the fifth letter is not L, and not the eliminated letters.

So possibilities: any letter except R,A,N,E,O,S,D,L.

Then what are the candidates? 
- The word is C H I L ? with ? being a letter from: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But what words are there? 
- ""CHILT""? Not a common word.
- ""CHILK""? Not a word.
- ""CHILM""? Not a word.
- ""CHILT""? Not common.
- ""CHIEF"" but E is out.
- ""CHINK"" but N is out.
- ""CHIMP"" -> C H I M P, but position 4 is M? We need position 4 to be L? So not.
- ""CHIRP"" R out.
- ""CHIZZ"" not a word.
- ""CHIVE"" E out.
- ""CHIZZ"" no.
- ""CHAPT"" A out.
- ""CHURL"" but R out and position 4 is U? Not L.

I can't think of any common word.

Perhaps ""CHILI"" is the only common word left? But then why the feedback for ""chill"" has L(-) for the fifth letter? It should be x.

Perhaps ""CHILL"" is the word, and the feedback for the fifth letter should be ✓.

Given the inconsistency, I will assume that the word is ""CHILL"" and the feedback for the fifth letter is a mistake, or that we should guess ""CHILL"" again? But that doesn't make sense.

Perhaps for the next guess, we can try ""CHILI"" to test.

So let's guess ""CHILI"".

If it's correct, we win.
If not, we get feedback.

So <guess>chili</guess>

### Analysis of Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  - **C** is correct and in position 1.  
  - **R, A, N, E** are absent.  

- **Guess 2: ""coils"" → Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)**  
  - **C** is correct (position 1).  
  - **I** is correct and in position 3.  
  - **L** is correct and in position 4.  
  - **O, S** are absent.  

- **Guess 3: ""child"" → Feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x)**  
  - **H** is correct and in position 2.  
  - **D** is absent.  
  - The word structure is **C H I L _** (positions 1–4 fixed).  

- **Guess 4: ""chill"" → Feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(-)**  
  - The fifth-letter **L** is marked as present but wrong position (`-`).  
  - This implies the word has **two L's**: one at position 4 (✓) and one elsewhere.  
  - Since positions 1–3 are fixed as **C, H, I** (not L), the second **L** must be at position 5.  
  - However, the `-` feedback for position 5 is inconsistent with this, as position 5 should be `✓` if it is **L**.  

### Resolution of Feedback Conflict
- The feedback for ""chill"" suggests a second **L** exists but not at position 5, yet positions 1–4 are fixed and cannot accommodate it.  
- This indicates the word is likely **CHILI** (with **I** at position 5), and the `-` for the fifth **L** in ""chill"" is due to:
  - The word having only one **L** (at position 4), so the fifth **L** in the guess should be `x` (absent), not `-`.  
- Given the feedback provided, **CHILI** is the only common word fitting all constraints:
  - Starts with **C**, position 2 is **H**, position 3 is **I**, position 4 is **L**.  
  - Position 5 cannot be **D, L, R, A, N, E, O, S** (eliminated letters).  
  - **CHILI** (C H I L I) uses **I** at position 5, which is not eliminated and fits the pattern.  

### Guess 5: ""chili""
- Tests **I** at position 5. If correct, it solves the puzzle. If not, it confirms the word must be **CHILL** (despite feedback inconsistency).  
- Uses no eliminated letters and leverages the only viable candidate.

<guess>chili</guess>",chili,"We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""chill"":
Feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(-)

Interpretation:
- The first four letters are correct: C at position 1, H at position 2, I at position 3, L at position 4.
- The fifth letter L is marked with (-), meaning that L is in the word but in the wrong position.

But note: we already have an L at position 4, which is correct. The feedback for the fifth letter L is (-), meaning there is another L in the word, but not at position 5.

Therefore, the word must have at least two L's: one at position 4 and one at another position? But the only positions left are 2 and 5? But position 2 is H, which is correct? So the second L must be at position 5? But the feedback says it's not at position 5? Contradiction?

Wait, let me reexamine:

The word structure we have so far: positions 1,2,3,4 are fixed as C,H,I,L. So the word is ""C H I L ?"".

We guessed ""CHILL"", which is ""C H I L L"". The feedback for the fifth letter is L(-), meaning that L is present in the word but not at position 5.

But we already know that L is at position 4? So if the word has only one L, then the L at position 5 would be absent? But the feedback says it's present but wrong position? That implies there must be a second L in the word? But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5? And positions 1,2,3,4 are fixed? So the second L must be at position 5? But the feedback says it's not at position 5? That's impossible.

Alternatively, the feedback might be interpreted as: the letter L is in the word but not in position 5? But we have an L at position 4? So the L at position 5 is a duplicate? And the feedback (-) for the fifth letter means that there is an L in the word (which we already know from position 4) but it is not at position 5? That makes sense? Because the duplicate L at position 5 is not correct? But the feedback symbol (-) typically means the letter is present but in the wrong position? However, in the case of duplicates, it can be tricky.

In Wordle, if the word has one L and you guess two L's, then:
- The L that is in the correct position (position 4) gets a ✓.
- The extra L (position 5) would get an x? Because the word only has one L? But in this feedback, it's (-)? So that would imply the word has two L's? But then one is at position 4 (correct) and the other should be at position 5? But the feedback says the position 5 L is not correct? So it must be in a different position? But we have no other positions? 

Wait, the word is only 5 letters? And positions 1,2,3 are fixed as C,H,I? So the only positions for the second L would be position 5? But if the word has two L's, then position 5 must be L? But the feedback says it's not? So that's a contradiction.

Therefore, the only logical explanation is that the word does not have two L's? But then why is the fifth letter L marked as (-)? That would be inconsistent.

Perhaps I misinterpreted the feedback? Let me read the feedback again:

Guess 4: chill -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(-)

This means:
- The first C is correct (position 1).
- The second H is correct (position 2).
- The third I is correct (position 3).
- The fourth L is correct (position 4).
- The fifth L is marked as (-), meaning it is present in the word but in the wrong position.

But if the word has the first four letters as C,H,I,L, then the fifth letter must be something else? And if the word has an L at position 5? Then it would be correct? But it's marked as (-), meaning wrong position? So the word cannot have L at position 5? But it must have an L at position 4? And if there is another L, it must be at position 5? But that's the only position left? 

Unless the word has an L in a position we haven't guessed? But we have fixed positions 1,2,3,4? So the only position left is 5? 

This is confusing.

Another possibility: the feedback for the fifth letter is (-) because the word has an L that is not at position 4? But we already have a ✓ for the L at position 4? So that L is accounted for? Then the fifth L is an extra? And if the word has only one L, then the fifth L should be marked x? But it's marked (-)? So the word must have two L's? But then the second L must be at position 5? But it's marked (-) meaning not at position 5? 

This is a paradox.

Perhaps the feedback is: the fifth letter L is present in the word but not at position 5? But the word has the L at position 4? So the fifth L is a duplicate? And the feedback (-) indicates that there is another L somewhere else? But in the word, the only L is at position 4? So the duplicate L in the guess is not in the word? But then it should be x? 

I think there might be a misunderstanding of the feedback system.

Let me recall the rules:

- ✓: The letter is in the word and in the correct position.
- -: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- x: The letter is not in the word.

In the case of duplicate letters:

If the word has one L and you guess two L's:
- If one of them is in the correct position, it gets ✓.
- The other L, if the word has only one L, gets x? Or if the word has two L's, then the other L might get - if it's in the wrong position? Or if it's in the correct position, it gets ✓.

But in this case, the word has one L at position 4? Then:
- The L at position 4 in the guess gets ✓.
- The L at position 5 in the guess is extra? So it should be x? Because the word has no second L.

But the feedback says L(-) for position 5? That would imply the word has a second L? But then where is it? The only positions are 1,2,3,4,5? And 1,2,3 are C,H,I? So the second L must be at position 5? But then it should be ✓? Not (-)? 

Unless the word is not what we think? 

Perhaps the fixed positions are not all correct? But the feedback says C(✓), H(✓), I(✓), L(✓) for the first four? So they are fixed.

The only possibility is that the word has two L's: one at position 4 and one at position 5? But then the fifth letter should be ✓? But it's marked (-)? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the feedback for the fifth letter is (-) because the letter L is in the word but not at position 5? But if the word has two L's, one at position 4 and one at position 5, then the fifth letter should be correct? 

I think there might be a mistake in the feedback or in our reasoning.

Let me reexamine the feedback from guess 2 and 3.

Guess 2: ""coils"" -> C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)
This means:
- C at position 1: correct.
- O at position 2: absent.
- I at position 3: correct.
- L at position 4: correct.
- S at position 5: absent.

So positions 1,3,4 are fixed: C, I, L.

Guess 3: ""child"" -> C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x)
This means:
- C at position 1: correct.
- H at position 2: correct? So position 2 is H.
- I at position 3: correct.
- L at position 4: correct.
- D at position 5: absent.

So after guess 3, we have the word as C H I L ? and D is absent.

Then guess 4: ""chill"" -> C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(-)

The feedback for the fifth letter is L(-), which means that L is in the word but not at position 5.

But we already have an L at position 4? So the word must have at least two L's? But then the second L must be at position 5? But the feedback says it's not at position 5? Contradiction.

Unless the word has an L at a position that is not 4 or 5? But positions 1,2,3 are fixed as C,H,I? So no room for another L? 

The only possibility is that the feedback for the fifth letter is (-) because the letter L is present in the word (at position 4) but the duplicate L in the guess at position 5 is not in the word? But then it should be marked x? 

I think there is a misunderstanding in the feedback notation.

Perhaps the feedback for the fifth letter is (-) because the word has an L, but it's not at position 5? And since we already have an L at position 4, that is accounted for by the ✓, so the fifth L is a separate instance? And if the word has only one L, then the fifth L should be x? But it's not? 

This suggests that the word has two L's: one at position 4 and one at a different position? But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5? And 1,2,3 are C,H,I? So the second L must be at position 5? But then it should be ✓? 

I think there might be a mistake in the feedback provided.

Perhaps the feedback for ""chill"" is: the fifth letter L is marked as (-) because there is an L in the word that is not at position 5, but we already have one at position 4? So the feedback is indicating that there is another L somewhere? But there is no somewhere else? 

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""CHILL"", but the feedback for the fifth letter is (-) by mistake? Or perhaps the word has the letter L at position 2 or 3? But we have H at position 2 and I at position 3, both correct? 

Let me consider: is it possible that the word is not ""C H I L ?"" but something else? But the feedback from guess 3 says H is correct at position 2? So it must be.

Unless the feedback is not for the position? But the feedback format shows the letter and then the symbol, and we assume it's for the position? 

I think we have to accept the feedback as given.

So the feedback for ""chill"" is:
- C at position 1: ✓
- H at position 2: ✓
- I at position 3: ✓
- L at position 4: ✓
- L at position 5: -  (meaning this L is in the word but not at position 5)

This implies that the word has at least two L's: one at position 4 and one at a different position. But the only positions are 1,2,3,5? But positions 1,2,3 are C,H,I? So they cannot be L? Therefore, the only possibility is that the word has an L at position 5? But then it should be ✓? 

This is unresolvable.

Perhaps the feedback for position 4 L is not necessarily meaning that the letter at position 4 is L? But the feedback says L(✓) for the fourth letter, so it is.

I think there might be a flaw in the problem or in my understanding.

Let me try to think of a word that fits all feedback.

From guess 1: ""crane"" -> C is correct at position 1, R,A,N,E absent.
From guess 2: ""coils"" -> C correct, I correct at position 3, L correct at position 4, O and S absent.
From guess 3: ""child"" -> C correct, H correct at position 2, I correct, L correct, D absent.
From guess 4: ""chill"" -> C correct, H correct, I correct, L correct at position 4, and the fifth L is present but not at position 5.

So the word must have: 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: ? but not D, and not L? But the feedback says the fifth letter L is present but not at position 5? That means there is an L in the word that is not at position 4 or 5? But position 4 is L, so it must be at position 1,2,3? But position 1 is C, 2 is H, 3 is I, so none of them are L? 

Unless the word has more than two L's? But still, the positions are fixed.

The only possibility is that the feedback for the fifth letter is (-) because the word has an L, but it's already been found at position 4, and the fifth L is not in the word? But then it should be x? 

I think there is a mistake in the feedback or in the interpretation.

Perhaps the feedback symbol for the fifth letter is (-) but it is not for the letter L? No, the feedback is given as L(-), so it's for the letter L.

Another idea: in some interpretations, if the word has one L and you guess two L's, with one in the correct position, the second L might be marked as (-) if there is no second L? But that would be incorrect feedback? Or in some systems, it might be marked x.

I recall that in Wordle, for duplicate letters:
- If the word has one L, and you guess a word with two L's, then the first L (in the correct position) gets ✓, and the second L gets x.

But in this feedback, the second L gets (-), which would only happen if the word has a second L in a different position.

But in this case, there is no different position for the second L.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the word has an L at position 5? But then the feedback should be ✓ for the fifth letter? 

Perhaps the feedback for position 4 is not L? But it is marked ✓ for L.

I think we have to proceed with the feedback as given.

So, the feedback says for ""chill"": fifth letter L is present but not at position 5. This means there is an L in the word at a position that is not 5. But we already have an L at position 4, so that is accounted for. Therefore, the word must have a second L at one of the positions 1,2,3? But they are fixed as C,H,I? So it's impossible.

Unless the fixed letters are not all correct? But the feedback says they are correct.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 3: ""child"" -> H at position 2 is correct, but maybe it's not H at position 2? But the feedback says H(✓) for position 2.

I think there's a deadlock.

Perhaps the word is ""CHILL"", and the feedback for the fifth letter is (-) by error? Or perhaps in this version, the feedback for duplicates is handled differently.

Given the feedback, we must conclude that the word has two L's: one at position 4 and one at a position that is not 5? But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Since 1,2,3 are C,H,I, the second L must be at position 5? But then it should be correct.

I think we have to ignore the feedback for the fifth letter or assume it's a mistake.

Perhaps the fifth letter is not L in the word, but there is an L in the word at a different position? But there is no different position.

Another possibility: the word has an L at position 5, but the feedback for position 4 is for the letter L, but it might be that the word has L at position 5 and not at position 4? But the feedback for guess 2 and 3 both say L is correct at position 4.

In guess 2: ""coils"" has L at position 4 and it's correct.
In guess 3: ""child"" has L at position 4 and it's correct.
So position 4 is definitely L.

Therefore, the only way the feedback for guess 4's fifth letter being (-) makes sense is if the word has a second L at a position that is not 4 or 5? But there is no such position.

I think we must proceed by assuming that the word has two L's, and the second L is at position 5, but the feedback is misreported? Or perhaps in this system, the feedback for the fifth letter is (-) to indicate that there is an L in the word (at position 4) but it's not at position 5? But that would be redundant because we already know position 4 is L.

I think for the sake of progressing, we should consider that the word is ""CHILL"" and the feedback for the fifth letter should be ✓, but it's given as (-), so maybe it's a typo.

Perhaps the word is ""CHILI"", and the feedback for the fifth letter of ""chill"" is (-) because the letter L is in the word (at position 4) but not at position 5, and the fifth letter of the word is I, not L. So for the guess ""chill"", the fifth letter L is not in the word at all? But then it should be x? But it's (-)? 

If the word is ""CHILI"", then:
- Position 1: C ✓
- Position 2: H ✓
- Position 3: I ✓
- Position 4: L ✓
- Position 5: I (not L)

In the guess ""chill"", the fifth letter is L, which is not in the word because the word has only one L at position 4? So it should be x? But the feedback says (-), which is wrong.

If the word has two I's, then for ""chill"":
- The fifth letter L is not in the word? So x.

But the feedback says (-), so it must be that the letter L is in the word but not at position 5. But in ""CHILI"", there is an L at position 4, so the letter L is in the word, but not at position 5, so the feedback (-) for the fifth letter L is correct? Because it's present elsewhere.

In Wordle, for a guess with a duplicate letter:
- The correct letters in the correct position are marked ✓.
- Then, for letters that are in the word but not in the correct position, they are marked (-), but only if they are not already accounted for.

In ""CHILI"" (the word) and guess ""CHILL"":
- Position 1: C ✓
- Position 2: H ✓
- Position 3: I ✓
- Position 4: L ✓
- Position 5: L (guess) vs I (word): L is not in the word because the only L is already used at position 4? So it should be x.

However, in some interpretations, the feedback might be:
- The first L (position 4) is correct, so it gets ✓.
- The second L (position 5) is not in the word (because the word has only one L), so it gets x.

But in this feedback, it's given as (-), which would be incorrect for ""CHILI"".

For ""CHILL"" (the word) and guess ""CHILL"", the fifth letter should be ✓.

So the feedback provided is inconsistent.

Given the feedback, we must assume that the word has two L's: one at position 4 and one at a position that is not 5? But that's impossible.

Perhaps the word is ""CHILL"", and the feedback for the fifth letter is ✓, but it's written as (-) by mistake.

Or perhaps the word is ""CLIMB"" but then position 4 is M? But feedback says L is correct at position 4.

I think we have to make a guess based on the information.

We know:
- The word is C H I L ? 
- The fifth letter cannot be D (from guess 3), and cannot be R,A,N,E,O,S.
- From guess 4, the fifth letter L is marked as (-), which suggests that L is in the word but not at position 5. But since position 4 is L, it must be that the word has a second L, but there's no room, so perhaps the fifth letter is not L, but there is an L in the word (at position 4) and the fifth letter is something else that is not L.

But the feedback for the fifth letter is specifically for the letter L, and it says it is present but not at position 5. So the letter L is in the word, but not at position 5. We already know it's at position 4, so that's consistent, but it doesn't give new information about the fifth letter.

In fact, the fifth letter could be any letter except the eliminated ones, and not L? Because if it were L, it would be in the correct position and should be ✓, but it's not, it's (-), which is for wrong position, so it can't be L.

So the fifth letter is not L, and not the eliminated letters.

So possibilities: any letter except R,A,N,E,O,S,D,L.

Then what are the candidates? 
- The word is C H I L ? with ? being a letter from: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But what words are there? 
- ""CHILT""? Not a common word.
- ""CHILK""? Not a word.
- ""CHILM""? Not a word.
- ""CHILT""? Not common.
- ""CHIEF"" but E is out.
- ""CHINK"" but N is out.
- ""CHIMP"" -> C H I M P, but position 4 is M? We need position 4 to be L? So not.
- ""CHIRP"" R out.
- ""CHIZZ"" not a word.
- ""CHIVE"" E out.
- ""CHIZZ"" no.
- ""CHAPT"" A out.
- ""CHURL"" but R out and position 4 is U? Not L.

I can't think of any common word.

Perhaps ""CHILI"" is the only common word left? But then why the feedback for ""chill"" has L(-) for the fifth letter? It should be x.

Perhaps ""CHILL"" is the word, and the feedback for the fifth letter should be ✓.

Given the inconsistency, I will assume that the word is ""CHILL"" and the feedback for the fifth letter is a mistake, or that we should guess ""CHILL"" again? But that doesn't make sense.

Perhaps for the next guess, we can try ""CHILI"" to test.

So let's guess ""CHILI"".

If it's correct, we win.
If not, we get feedback.

So <guess>chili</guess>### Analysis of Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  - **C** is correct and in position 1.  
  - **R, A, N, E** are absent.  

- **Guess 2: ""coils"" → Feedback: C(✓) O(x) I(✓) L(✓) S(x)**  
  - **C** is correct (position 1).  
  - **I** is correct and in position 3.  
  - **L** is correct and in position 4.  
  - **O, S** are absent.  

- **Guess 3: ""child"" → Feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) D(x)**  
  - **H** is correct and in position 2.  
  - **D** is absent.  
  - The word structure is **C H I L _** (positions 1–4 fixed).  

- **Guess 4: ""chill"" → Feedback: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(-)**  
  - The fifth-letter **L** is marked as present but wrong position (`-`).  
  - This implies the word has **two L's**: one at position 4 (✓) and one elsewhere.  
  - Since positions 1–3 are fixed as **C, H, I** (not L), the second **L** must be at position 5.  
  - However, the `-` feedback for position 5 is inconsistent with this, as position 5 should be `✓` if it is **L**.  

### Resolution of Feedback Conflict
- The feedback for ""chill"" suggests a second **L** exists but not at position 5, yet positions 1–4 are fixed and cannot accommodate it.  
- This indicates the word is likely **CHILI** (with **I** at position 5), and the `-` for the fifth **L** in ""chill"" is due to:
  - The word having only one **L** (at position 4), so the fifth **L** in the guess should be `x` (absent), not `-`.  
- Given the feedback provided, **CHILI** is the only common word fitting all constraints:
  - Starts with **C**, position 2 is **H**, position 3 is **I**, position 4 is **L**.  
  - Position 5 cannot be **D, L, R, A, N, E, O, S** (eliminated letters).  
  - **CHILI** (C H I L I) uses **I** at position 5, which is not eliminated and fits the pattern.  

### Guess 5: ""chili""
- Tests **I** at position 5. If correct, it solves the puzzle. If not, it confirms the word must be **CHILL** (despite feedback inconsistency).  
- Uses no eliminated letters and leverages the only viable candidate.",Guess 5: chili -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) I(✓) L(✓) I(✓),SUCCESS
