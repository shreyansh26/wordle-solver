We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 Since C, R, A, and N are all absent, we know that the secret word does not contain these letters.

 The feedback for E was a '-' meaning E is in the word but not in the fifth position (since we guessed it in the fifth position).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, but not at the end. Also, it does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 We have 5 tries left.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Is a 5-letter English word.
 - Avoids the letters C, R, A, N because they are absent.
 - Must contain E (since E is present) but not in the fifth position.

 Additionally, we can use common letters to maximize information.

 Since we know E is in the word, we can try to place E in a different position.

 Common consonants remaining: we can use letters like S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 Let's choose a word that has E in a different position and avoids C,R,A,N.

 We also note that the secret word has E, but not in the fifth position. So E must be in one of positions 1-4.

 Possible starting words: We need a word without C,R,A,N.

 Some options: 
   We could try ""SPIEL"", but let's think of words that have E and other common letters.

 Another idea: ""HOUSE"" -> but note that E is at the end, and we know E isn't at the end? 
   However, our feedback says E is in the word but not in the fifth position. So we cannot put E in the fifth position again.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end? But we are not allowed to put E at the end? 
   Actually, we can put E at the end again? Let me clarify: The feedback says E is present but not in the fifth position. 
   That is, in this particular word, E was in the fifth position and it was wrong. 
   But E might appear more than once? The feedback does not indicate multiple E's. 
   However, the secret word might have only one E? 

 So when we guess, we can try E in a different position. Avoiding fifth.

 Let me avoid E in the fifth position.

 Some words without E at the end:

   First position: ""EAGLE"" -> but A is already eliminated? We know A is not in the word, so ""EAGLE"" has A which is bad.

   Second position: like ""LEMON"" -> but L,E,M,O,N? Wait, N is eliminated! So we cannot use N.

   Third position: ""PLUME"" -> E at the end? Not good.

   Fourth position: ""SMILE"" -> E at the end? Not good.

 We need E not in the fifth. So positions 1,2,3,4.

 Let me think of words with E in the first position that do not contain C,R,A,N.

 Examples: 
   ""EAGLE"" has A -> invalid because A is absent.
   ""EERIE"" has multiple E's? And avoids A,C,N,R? But it has R? Wait, R is absent so we cannot use R? 
   Actually, R is absent so we cannot include R. ""EERIE"" has R? No: EERIE has letters E, E, R, I, E? 
   Actually: E E R I E? That has R? So avoid.

   ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth positions? And avoids A,C,R,N? Letters: E, D, G, E, S -> no C,R,A,N.

   But we don't know if the word has multiple E's? We only know there is at least one E. 
   However, we are trying to maximize new information.

   Another word: ""EBONY"" -> has N? No, we know N is absent. So avoid N.

   ""ELOPE"": Letters: E, L, O, P, E -> avoids C,R,A,N? And E in first and fifth? But we know E is not in fifth? 
   We are not sure about fifth? Actually, our feedback said E is present but not in fifth? 
   So the secret word has at least one E that is not in the fifth position. 
   It could have another E in the fifth? But we don't know.

   However, we want to avoid the fifth position for E because we know that the fifth letter is not E? 
   Actually, the feedback tells us that the fifth letter was not E in the secret word? 
   Our guess ""crane"" had E at the fifth, and it was marked as '-' meaning E is in the word but not at that spot. 
   So the fifth letter of the secret word is not E. Therefore, we should avoid putting E in the fifth again? 
   But we can put it again? It doesn't matter because we are trying to learn more.

   However, we already know E is not in fifth? So we should try E in a different position.

   Let's choose a word with E not in fifth and without C,R,A,N.

   Words with E in position 1: 
      ELBOW -> letters: E, L, B, O, W -> avoids A,C,R,N?
      ELITE -> E, L, I, T, E -> but we use E twice? And avoids C,R,A,N? 
          However, note: we don't know if the secret word has two E's? So it's okay.

   But let's look for words with more common letters.

   Another common letter is T, so I might want to include T.

   Word with E in second position? 
      ""TEETH"" -> E in second and fourth? But T is used twice? 
      But avoids A,C,R,N? 
          Also, we don't know about T? 

   We haven't tested T yet? So we can use T.

   Common starting words with E and avoiding C,R,A,N: 
      ""SLATE"" -> S,L,A,T,E? But A is eliminated -> invalid.
      ""ROAST"" -> has R and A -> invalid.

   How about ""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? But E is at the fourth position? And the fifth letter is L? 

   But note: we need words without A, R, N, C.

   Another: ""BOWEL"": B,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? 

   But we also want to test more new letters.

   Let's list available letters: we haven't used many.

   We know E is present. We have used C,R,A,N,E (from first guess). 

   So available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

   We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter in the secret word.

   Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, S, T, L, O, I, ... but we already know E is there.

   So include S, T, L, O.

   How about a word that has E and S, T, L, O? Without using C,R,A,N.

   Example: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        But note: ""STOLE"" has E at the end? We don't want to put E at the end? 
        Because we know the fifth letter is not E? 
        But we can use it to test other positions? 

        We are forced to put E somewhere? The feedback does not forbid E at the end? 
        We just know that it's not in the fifth position? So putting E at the end again would not help? 
        Because we already know E is present and not at the fifth? 

        However, the secret word might have E at more than one position? 
        We don't know. So by putting E at the end again, if the secret word has two E's? 
        Then we would get '-' for E again? 

        Alternatively, we might learn about other letters.

   Since we have E present, we can try to place it in a different position to see where it goes.

   Why not put E at the beginning? 

   Let me choose ""ELOPS"": but I'm not sure if it's a valid word? 

   Alternatively, ""STOLE"" is valid? But E at the end is redundant? 

   Another word: ""HOMES"" -> H,O,M,E,S -> E is fourth? 
   Also, avoids A,C,R,N? 

   Or ""TIMES"": T,I,M,E,S -> E in fourth? 

   Or ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> E in fifth? We avoid fifth? 

   Let's avoid E in fifth? 

   How about ""TILES"": T,I,L,E,S -> E in fourth? 
   But that's one letter? 

   Another idea: ""FLUID"", but no E? We must include E? Or we don't have to? 
   Actually, we don't have to include E? But note: the feedback only tells us that E is in the word? 
   But we have not confirmed where? So including E in a different position might help locate it.

   However, if we don't include E, we might not get information about E? But we already know E is present? 
   So we can choose words without E? That might help test other letters? 

   The rules say we can guess any valid word? But strategically, we want to find the word quickly.

   Since we know E is present, and we don't know its position, we should try E in a different position? 

   So I think we should put E in one of positions 1 to 4.

   Let me choose a word with E in the first position: 
      ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. 
      This way, if E is in the first position, we get a ✓ for E? Otherwise, if E is not in first, but in the word, we get a '-'? 

   Alternatively, we can put E in a more common position? 

   Common positions for E: not at the end? Then in the middle? 

   According to feedback, E was at fifth and that was wrong? So E must be in 1,2,3,4.

   We can also try E in the second position? 

   Let me pick a word with E in the second position and common letters: 
      ""BELLY"": B,E,L,L,Y -> but double L? 
      ""TEETH"": double E? 
      ""BESTI"": no.

   How about ""METAL""? But A is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""LEMON"": but L,E,M,O,N? We have N? N is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""PETOS"": not a word? 

   Let me think: without A and N, and with E in second? 
      ""HELIO"" is not 5 letters? 
      ""DEUCE"" but D,E,U,C,E? C is eliminated -> invalid.

   Words with E in the third position: 
      ""CRUES"" -> C is eliminated -> invalid?
      ""SPIEL"": S,P,I,E,L -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        E is fourth? Wait: S P I E L -> third letter I, fourth E? 
        We want E in third? 

   Actually: 
      ""GRUEL"" -> G,R,U,E,L? R is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""SUEDE"": S,U,E,D,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. But E in third and fifth? 
        Fifth: we know E is not fifth? So we get '-' for third position? Or if the word has only one E? 

   This is getting messy.

   Since we have eliminated only 4 letters (C,R,A,N) and have 22 left? 

   Let's choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible? And put E in a non-fifth position.

   Example: ""SPIEL"" -> 
        letters: S, P, I, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.
        E is in the fifth? Wait: 
            P-O-S-I-T-I-O-N: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E? Wait, it's S-P-I-E-L -> so E is fourth? 
            So E in fourth position? 
        Then fifth is L? 
        That's fine.

   Or ""TOWED"": T,O,W,E,D -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fourth? 

   Or ""MOVIE"": M,O,V,I,E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fifth? We avoid? 

   So ""SPIEL"" sounds good: 
        S, P, I, E, L -> no duplicates? 

   We'll use that? 

   But note: we must be cautious: E is in fourth position? 

   What if the secret word has E in the first position? Then we would get S,P,I -> all absent? 
   And E as '-', L absent? That might not be informative? 

   Alternatively, we can use a word that starts with E? 

   Let me look for a better word? 

   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E at the end? We avoid? 

   ""STOLE"": E at the end? We avoid? 

   But we can try ""STEEL""? But not 5 distinct letters? 

   How about ""KELP""? Not 5 letters? 

   I think ""QUEST"": Q,U,E,S,T -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in third? 
        But Q is uncommon? 

   Let me go with ""SPIEL"". 

   So we guess ""SPIEL""? 

   But note: we might get more information.

   Alternatively, we can try ""E"", in the first position? 

   Let me decide: 

   Option 1: ""ELTCH"" (not a word) -> no.

   Option 2: ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth? Avoid C,R,A,N? Yes. Letters: E,D,G,E,S -> duplicates E? 
        If we guess it, the duplicate E might be confusing? 
        But the feedback will show: 
            First E: ✓ or -? 
            Fourth E? If the word has only one E and in the first? Then we get E(✓) and then E(x) for fourth? 
            Or if it also has E elsewhere? 

   But we don't know? 

   How about ""STOLE""? Even though E is at the end? We know the fifth letter is not E. 
        But if we put E at the end again, then the feedback for E will be '-', meaning E is present but not at fifth? 
        But we already know that? And we might learn about the other positions? 

        Actually, we haven't tested the fifth letter? We only know it's not E? So we can test other letters? 

        So ""STOLE"" has E at fifth? And we know it's not E? So we expect a '-' for E? 
        But we will learn about S,T,O,L: 
            If any of them are in the word? 

        However, we are testing S,T,O,L? 

        Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" tests S,P,I,E,L? 

        Either is fine? 

   Considering that E is already known to be present? Maybe we can avoid including E? 

   Actually, we have 5 guesses left? And we don't lose much? 

   However, we want to cover common letters? 

   Common letters: S, T, L, O, I are common? 

   So ""STOLE"" tests S,T,O,L,E? 
   But E at fifth: we expect a '-'? 
   Then we would get: 
        S at position 1 -> (✓ or - or x)
        T at 2 -> similarly
        O at 3 -> similarly
        L at 4 -> similarly
        E at 5 -> will be '-' (as expected)

   Since we know E is present? Then regardless of other letters? 

   But we are testing 5 letters? With E being known? 

   Alternatively, I found a word: ""STILE"" (a type of ladder)? S,T,I,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        Also, E is at fifth? And we avoid fifth? 

   But note: we haven't tried words with E not at fifth? 

   Given that we already know E is present and not at fifth, we might try to find E's position by putting it in an early position? 

   Let me choose a word that starts with E? 

   Example: ""ELAND""? Has A? A is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""EDGED""? Doubled E and D? 

   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.
        E in first? 
        This tests E,I,G,H,T? 

   Also, ""INLET"": I,N,L,E,T -> has N? Eliminated? 

   ""EASEL""? has A and E doubled? 

   ""EVITE"": E,V,I,T,E -> avoid? 

   ""ETUDE"": E,T,U,D,E -> avoid duplicates? 

   ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

        So ""EXIST"": E(1), X(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). 
        But T is at fifth? We don't know about T? 

   But note, we don't want to use fifth for E? But fifth here is T? 

   So ""EXIST"" has E at first? 

   I think ""EXIST"" or ""EIGHT""?

   Commonality: S is more common than G and H? 

   So ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> it tests E at first? 

   We might get E(✓) if E is at first? 

   Otherwise, E(-) if E is elsewhere? 

   So let me choose a word like ""EXIST"".

   We have to decide.

   Given the above, I will choose ""EXIST"". 

   So our second guess: ""EXIST""

   But let me see: 
        We avoid C,R,A,N? Yes: E,X,I,S,T doesn't have any of C,R,A,N.

   So guess ""EXIST"".

   Alternatively, if we want to avoid X? because X is rare? 

   Then ""MIDST"" -> M,I,D,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        But doesn't include E? Then we don't test E? 
        But we know E is present? So by not including E, we might get no feedback for E? 
        And then we don't learn about the position? 
        However, we will learn about these letters? 

        But if the word has E, and E is in ""MIDST"", we would not learn its position? 

        Actually, the feedback will still be: 
            If M is not in word -> x
            I -> if in word and in position: ✓ or -? 
            D -> same
            S -> same
            T -> same

        And if E is in the word? It doesn't come up? 

        So we don't get info on E? 

        That's bad because we know E is present? 

        We should include E? 

   Therefore, we must include E? 

   So I go with ""EXIST"" or ""SPIEL""? 

   After consideration, let me choose ""SPIEL"": 
        Reason: It includes E (but not fifth? fourth instead) and avoids C,R,A,N? 
        Also, letters S,P,I,E,L -> common letters? 

   We'll guess ""SPIEL"".

   But note: position of E? In ""SPIEL"" the positions are: 
        1: S
        2: P
        3: I
        4: E
        5: L

   So we are testing E in fourth? 

   If the secret word has E in fourth? We get ✓ for E? 
   Otherwise, if it has E elsewhere? Then '-' for E? 

   But let's hope we get some other hits? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word with E in the first? 

   Since we don't know? But time is short? 

   Another common word: ""POUND"" -> skip because we don't have E? 

   We must include E? 

   So ""QUEUE"" is not helpful? 

   Final: Guess ""SPIEL""

   Or ""E"", first: ""ENTRY"" -> has N? and R? -> invalid.

   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        And E in first? 

   I think ""EIGHT"" is a good word? 

   So I'll choose ""EIGHT""

   Why? It tests E at position 1? And I,G,H,T? 

   We haven't tested G,H,T,I? 

   Common letters: I, T, H are common? 

   Let's do ""EIGHT""

   So guess: ""EIGHT""

   Second guess: ""eight""

   But note: E is at first? 

   We expect if E is first, ✓. If not, then '-' because we know E is present? 

   But what if the secret word has no E at the first? Then we get '-' and we know E is in the word? 

   So this is acceptable.

   We proceed with ""EIGHT"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked as ""-"").

This means:
- The secret word contains the letter E, located in positions 1–4.
- The letters C, R, A, and N must be excluded from all subsequent guesses.

For the next guess:
- We need to include E in a different position (anywhere except the 5th) to help identify its correct location.
- Letters like T, I, G, and H are strong choices because they are common in English words and haven't been tested yet.
- ""EIGHT"" aligns with these criteria: 
  - E is placed in position 1 (testing if E appears there).
  - T, I, G, and H are new letters that maximize information gain.
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

This guess will help narrow down the position of E and test four additional common letters efficiently.

<guess>eight</guess>",eight,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 Since C, R, A, and N are all absent, we know that the secret word does not contain these letters.

 The feedback for E was a '-' meaning E is in the word but not in the fifth position (since we guessed it in the fifth position).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, but not at the end. Also, it does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 We have 5 tries left.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Is a 5-letter English word.
 - Avoids the letters C, R, A, N because they are absent.
 - Must contain E (since E is present) but not in the fifth position.

 Additionally, we can use common letters to maximize information.

 Since we know E is in the word, we can try to place E in a different position.

 Common consonants remaining: we can use letters like S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 Let's choose a word that has E in a different position and avoids C,R,A,N.

 We also note that the secret word has E, but not in the fifth position. So E must be in one of positions 1-4.

 Possible starting words: We need a word without C,R,A,N.

 Some options: 
   We could try ""SPIEL"", but let's think of words that have E and other common letters.

 Another idea: ""HOUSE"" -> but note that E is at the end, and we know E isn't at the end? 
   However, our feedback says E is in the word but not in the fifth position. So we cannot put E in the fifth position again.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end? But we are not allowed to put E at the end? 
   Actually, we can put E at the end again? Let me clarify: The feedback says E is present but not in the fifth position. 
   That is, in this particular word, E was in the fifth position and it was wrong. 
   But E might appear more than once? The feedback does not indicate multiple E's. 
   However, the secret word might have only one E? 

 So when we guess, we can try E in a different position. Avoiding fifth.

 Let me avoid E in the fifth position.

 Some words without E at the end:

   First position: ""EAGLE"" -> but A is already eliminated? We know A is not in the word, so ""EAGLE"" has A which is bad.

   Second position: like ""LEMON"" -> but L,E,M,O,N? Wait, N is eliminated! So we cannot use N.

   Third position: ""PLUME"" -> E at the end? Not good.

   Fourth position: ""SMILE"" -> E at the end? Not good.

 We need E not in the fifth. So positions 1,2,3,4.

 Let me think of words with E in the first position that do not contain C,R,A,N.

 Examples: 
   ""EAGLE"" has A -> invalid because A is absent.
   ""EERIE"" has multiple E's? And avoids A,C,N,R? But it has R? Wait, R is absent so we cannot use R? 
   Actually, R is absent so we cannot include R. ""EERIE"" has R? No: EERIE has letters E, E, R, I, E? 
   Actually: E E R I E? That has R? So avoid.

   ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth positions? And avoids A,C,R,N? Letters: E, D, G, E, S -> no C,R,A,N.

   But we don't know if the word has multiple E's? We only know there is at least one E. 
   However, we are trying to maximize new information.

   Another word: ""EBONY"" -> has N? No, we know N is absent. So avoid N.

   ""ELOPE"": Letters: E, L, O, P, E -> avoids C,R,A,N? And E in first and fifth? But we know E is not in fifth? 
   We are not sure about fifth? Actually, our feedback said E is present but not in fifth? 
   So the secret word has at least one E that is not in the fifth position. 
   It could have another E in the fifth? But we don't know.

   However, we want to avoid the fifth position for E because we know that the fifth letter is not E? 
   Actually, the feedback tells us that the fifth letter was not E in the secret word? 
   Our guess ""crane"" had E at the fifth, and it was marked as '-' meaning E is in the word but not at that spot. 
   So the fifth letter of the secret word is not E. Therefore, we should avoid putting E in the fifth again? 
   But we can put it again? It doesn't matter because we are trying to learn more.

   However, we already know E is not in fifth? So we should try E in a different position.

   Let's choose a word with E not in fifth and without C,R,A,N.

   Words with E in position 1: 
      ELBOW -> letters: E, L, B, O, W -> avoids A,C,R,N?
      ELITE -> E, L, I, T, E -> but we use E twice? And avoids C,R,A,N? 
          However, note: we don't know if the secret word has two E's? So it's okay.

   But let's look for words with more common letters.

   Another common letter is T, so I might want to include T.

   Word with E in second position? 
      ""TEETH"" -> E in second and fourth? But T is used twice? 
      But avoids A,C,R,N? 
          Also, we don't know about T? 

   We haven't tested T yet? So we can use T.

   Common starting words with E and avoiding C,R,A,N: 
      ""SLATE"" -> S,L,A,T,E? But A is eliminated -> invalid.
      ""ROAST"" -> has R and A -> invalid.

   How about ""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? But E is at the fourth position? And the fifth letter is L? 

   But note: we need words without A, R, N, C.

   Another: ""BOWEL"": B,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? 

   But we also want to test more new letters.

   Let's list available letters: we haven't used many.

   We know E is present. We have used C,R,A,N,E (from first guess). 

   So available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

   We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter in the secret word.

   Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, S, T, L, O, I, ... but we already know E is there.

   So include S, T, L, O.

   How about a word that has E and S, T, L, O? Without using C,R,A,N.

   Example: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        But note: ""STOLE"" has E at the end? We don't want to put E at the end? 
        Because we know the fifth letter is not E? 
        But we can use it to test other positions? 

        We are forced to put E somewhere? The feedback does not forbid E at the end? 
        We just know that it's not in the fifth position? So putting E at the end again would not help? 
        Because we already know E is present and not at the fifth? 

        However, the secret word might have E at more than one position? 
        We don't know. So by putting E at the end again, if the secret word has two E's? 
        Then we would get '-' for E again? 

        Alternatively, we might learn about other letters.

   Since we have E present, we can try to place it in a different position to see where it goes.

   Why not put E at the beginning? 

   Let me choose ""ELOPS"": but I'm not sure if it's a valid word? 

   Alternatively, ""STOLE"" is valid? But E at the end is redundant? 

   Another word: ""HOMES"" -> H,O,M,E,S -> E is fourth? 
   Also, avoids A,C,R,N? 

   Or ""TIMES"": T,I,M,E,S -> E in fourth? 

   Or ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> E in fifth? We avoid fifth? 

   Let's avoid E in fifth? 

   How about ""TILES"": T,I,L,E,S -> E in fourth? 
   But that's one letter? 

   Another idea: ""FLUID"", but no E? We must include E? Or we don't have to? 
   Actually, we don't have to include E? But note: the feedback only tells us that E is in the word? 
   But we have not confirmed where? So including E in a different position might help locate it.

   However, if we don't include E, we might not get information about E? But we already know E is present? 
   So we can choose words without E? That might help test other letters? 

   The rules say we can guess any valid word? But strategically, we want to find the word quickly.

   Since we know E is present, and we don't know its position, we should try E in a different position? 

   So I think we should put E in one of positions 1 to 4.

   Let me choose a word with E in the first position: 
      ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. 
      This way, if E is in the first position, we get a ✓ for E? Otherwise, if E is not in first, but in the word, we get a '-'? 

   Alternatively, we can put E in a more common position? 

   Common positions for E: not at the end? Then in the middle? 

   According to feedback, E was at fifth and that was wrong? So E must be in 1,2,3,4.

   We can also try E in the second position? 

   Let me pick a word with E in the second position and common letters: 
      ""BELLY"": B,E,L,L,Y -> but double L? 
      ""TEETH"": double E? 
      ""BESTI"": no.

   How about ""METAL""? But A is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""LEMON"": but L,E,M,O,N? We have N? N is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""PETOS"": not a word? 

   Let me think: without A and N, and with E in second? 
      ""HELIO"" is not 5 letters? 
      ""DEUCE"" but D,E,U,C,E? C is eliminated -> invalid.

   Words with E in the third position: 
      ""CRUES"" -> C is eliminated -> invalid?
      ""SPIEL"": S,P,I,E,L -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        E is fourth? Wait: S P I E L -> third letter I, fourth E? 
        We want E in third? 

   Actually: 
      ""GRUEL"" -> G,R,U,E,L? R is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""SUEDE"": S,U,E,D,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. But E in third and fifth? 
        Fifth: we know E is not fifth? So we get '-' for third position? Or if the word has only one E? 

   This is getting messy.

   Since we have eliminated only 4 letters (C,R,A,N) and have 22 left? 

   Let's choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible? And put E in a non-fifth position.

   Example: ""SPIEL"" -> 
        letters: S, P, I, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.
        E is in the fifth? Wait: 
            P-O-S-I-T-I-O-N: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E? Wait, it's S-P-I-E-L -> so E is fourth? 
            So E in fourth position? 
        Then fifth is L? 
        That's fine.

   Or ""TOWED"": T,O,W,E,D -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fourth? 

   Or ""MOVIE"": M,O,V,I,E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fifth? We avoid? 

   So ""SPIEL"" sounds good: 
        S, P, I, E, L -> no duplicates? 

   We'll use that? 

   But note: we must be cautious: E is in fourth position? 

   What if the secret word has E in the first position? Then we would get S,P,I -> all absent? 
   And E as '-', L absent? That might not be informative? 

   Alternatively, we can use a word that starts with E? 

   Let me look for a better word? 

   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E at the end? We avoid? 

   ""STOLE"": E at the end? We avoid? 

   But we can try ""STEEL""? But not 5 distinct letters? 

   How about ""KELP""? Not 5 letters? 

   I think ""QUEST"": Q,U,E,S,T -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in third? 
        But Q is uncommon? 

   Let me go with ""SPIEL"". 

   So we guess ""SPIEL""? 

   But note: we might get more information.

   Alternatively, we can try ""E"", in the first position? 

   Let me decide: 

   Option 1: ""ELTCH"" (not a word) -> no.

   Option 2: ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth? Avoid C,R,A,N? Yes. Letters: E,D,G,E,S -> duplicates E? 
        If we guess it, the duplicate E might be confusing? 
        But the feedback will show: 
            First E: ✓ or -? 
            Fourth E? If the word has only one E and in the first? Then we get E(✓) and then E(x) for fourth? 
            Or if it also has E elsewhere? 

   But we don't know? 

   How about ""STOLE""? Even though E is at the end? We know the fifth letter is not E. 
        But if we put E at the end again, then the feedback for E will be '-', meaning E is present but not at fifth? 
        But we already know that? And we might learn about the other positions? 

        Actually, we haven't tested the fifth letter? We only know it's not E? So we can test other letters? 

        So ""STOLE"" has E at fifth? And we know it's not E? So we expect a '-' for E? 
        But we will learn about S,T,O,L: 
            If any of them are in the word? 

        However, we are testing S,T,O,L? 

        Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" tests S,P,I,E,L? 

        Either is fine? 

   Considering that E is already known to be present? Maybe we can avoid including E? 

   Actually, we have 5 guesses left? And we don't lose much? 

   However, we want to cover common letters? 

   Common letters: S, T, L, O, I are common? 

   So ""STOLE"" tests S,T,O,L,E? 
   But E at fifth: we expect a '-'? 
   Then we would get: 
        S at position 1 -> (✓ or - or x)
        T at 2 -> similarly
        O at 3 -> similarly
        L at 4 -> similarly
        E at 5 -> will be '-' (as expected)

   Since we know E is present? Then regardless of other letters? 

   But we are testing 5 letters? With E being known? 

   Alternatively, I found a word: ""STILE"" (a type of ladder)? S,T,I,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        Also, E is at fifth? And we avoid fifth? 

   But note: we haven't tried words with E not at fifth? 

   Given that we already know E is present and not at fifth, we might try to find E's position by putting it in an early position? 

   Let me choose a word that starts with E? 

   Example: ""ELAND""? Has A? A is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""EDGED""? Doubled E and D? 

   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.
        E in first? 
        This tests E,I,G,H,T? 

   Also, ""INLET"": I,N,L,E,T -> has N? Eliminated? 

   ""EASEL""? has A and E doubled? 

   ""EVITE"": E,V,I,T,E -> avoid? 

   ""ETUDE"": E,T,U,D,E -> avoid duplicates? 

   ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

        So ""EXIST"": E(1), X(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). 
        But T is at fifth? We don't know about T? 

   But note, we don't want to use fifth for E? But fifth here is T? 

   So ""EXIST"" has E at first? 

   I think ""EXIST"" or ""EIGHT""?

   Commonality: S is more common than G and H? 

   So ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> it tests E at first? 

   We might get E(✓) if E is at first? 

   Otherwise, E(-) if E is elsewhere? 

   So let me choose a word like ""EXIST"".

   We have to decide.

   Given the above, I will choose ""EXIST"". 

   So our second guess: ""EXIST""

   But let me see: 
        We avoid C,R,A,N? Yes: E,X,I,S,T doesn't have any of C,R,A,N.

   So guess ""EXIST"".

   Alternatively, if we want to avoid X? because X is rare? 

   Then ""MIDST"" -> M,I,D,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        But doesn't include E? Then we don't test E? 
        But we know E is present? So by not including E, we might get no feedback for E? 
        And then we don't learn about the position? 
        However, we will learn about these letters? 

        But if the word has E, and E is in ""MIDST"", we would not learn its position? 

        Actually, the feedback will still be: 
            If M is not in word -> x
            I -> if in word and in position: ✓ or -? 
            D -> same
            S -> same
            T -> same

        And if E is in the word? It doesn't come up? 

        So we don't get info on E? 

        That's bad because we know E is present? 

        We should include E? 

   Therefore, we must include E? 

   So I go with ""EXIST"" or ""SPIEL""? 

   After consideration, let me choose ""SPIEL"": 
        Reason: It includes E (but not fifth? fourth instead) and avoids C,R,A,N? 
        Also, letters S,P,I,E,L -> common letters? 

   We'll guess ""SPIEL"".

   But note: position of E? In ""SPIEL"" the positions are: 
        1: S
        2: P
        3: I
        4: E
        5: L

   So we are testing E in fourth? 

   If the secret word has E in fourth? We get ✓ for E? 
   Otherwise, if it has E elsewhere? Then '-' for E? 

   But let's hope we get some other hits? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word with E in the first? 

   Since we don't know? But time is short? 

   Another common word: ""POUND"" -> skip because we don't have E? 

   We must include E? 

   So ""QUEUE"" is not helpful? 

   Final: Guess ""SPIEL""

   Or ""E"", first: ""ENTRY"" -> has N? and R? -> invalid.

   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        And E in first? 

   I think ""EIGHT"" is a good word? 

   So I'll choose ""EIGHT""

   Why? It tests E at position 1? And I,G,H,T? 

   We haven't tested G,H,T,I? 

   Common letters: I, T, H are common? 

   Let's do ""EIGHT""

   So guess: ""EIGHT""

   Second guess: ""eight""

   But note: E is at first? 

   We expect if E is first, ✓. If not, then '-' because we know E is present? 

   But what if the secret word has no E at the first? Then we get '-' and we know E is in the word? 

   So this is acceptable.

   We proceed with ""EIGHT"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked as ""-"").

This means:
- The secret word contains the letter E, located in positions 1–4.
- The letters C, R, A, and N must be excluded from all subsequent guesses.

For the next guess:
- We need to include E in a different position (anywhere except the 5th) to help identify its correct location.
- Letters like T, I, G, and H are strong choices because they are common in English words and haven't been tested yet.
- ""EIGHT"" aligns with these criteria: 
  - E is placed in position 1 (testing if E appears there).
  - T, I, G, and H are new letters that maximize information gain.
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

This guess will help narrow down the position of E and test four additional common letters efficiently.",Guess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,libel,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 Since C, R, A, and N are all absent, we know that the secret word does not contain these letters.

 The feedback for E was a '-' meaning E is in the word but not in the fifth position (since we guessed it in the fifth position).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, but not at the end. Also, it does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 We have 5 tries left.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Is a 5-letter English word.
 - Avoids the letters C, R, A, N because they are absent.
 - Must contain E (since E is present) but not in the fifth position.

 Additionally, we can use common letters to maximize information.

 Since we know E is in the word, we can try to place E in a different position.

 Common consonants remaining: we can use letters like S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 Let's choose a word that has E in a different position and avoids C,R,A,N.

 We also note that the secret word has E, but not in the fifth position. So E must be in one of positions 1-4.

 Possible starting words: We need a word without C,R,A,N.

 Some options: 
   We could try ""SPIEL"", but let's think of words that have E and other common letters.

 Another idea: ""HOUSE"" -> but note that E is at the end, and we know E isn't at the end? 
   However, our feedback says E is in the word but not in the fifth position. So we cannot put E in the fifth position again.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end? But we are not allowed to put E at the end? 
   Actually, we can put E at the end again? Let me clarify: The feedback says E is present but not in the fifth position. 
   That is, in this particular word, E was in the fifth position and it was wrong. 
   But E might appear more than once? The feedback does not indicate multiple E's. 
   However, the secret word might have only one E? 

 So when we guess, we can try E in a different position. Avoiding fifth.

 Let me avoid E in the fifth position.

 Some words without E at the end:

   First position: ""EAGLE"" -> but A is already eliminated? We know A is not in the word, so ""EAGLE"" has A which is bad.

   Second position: like ""LEMON"" -> but L,E,M,O,N? Wait, N is eliminated! So we cannot use N.

   Third position: ""PLUME"" -> E at the end? Not good.

   Fourth position: ""SMILE"" -> E at the end? Not good.

 We need E not in the fifth. So positions 1,2,3,4.

 Let me think of words with E in the first position that do not contain C,R,A,N.

 Examples: 
   ""EAGLE"" has A -> invalid because A is absent.
   ""EERIE"" has multiple E's? And avoids A,C,N,R? But it has R? Wait, R is absent so we cannot use R? 
   Actually, R is absent so we cannot include R. ""EERIE"" has R? No: EERIE has letters E, E, R, I, E? 
   Actually: E E R I E? That has R? So avoid.

   ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth positions? And avoids A,C,R,N? Letters: E, D, G, E, S -> no C,R,A,N.

   But we don't know if the word has multiple E's? We only know there is at least one E. 
   However, we are trying to maximize new information.

   Another word: ""EBONY"" -> has N? No, we know N is absent. So avoid N.

   ""ELOPE"": Letters: E, L, O, P, E -> avoids C,R,A,N? And E in first and fifth? But we know E is not in fifth? 
   We are not sure about fifth? Actually, our feedback said E is present but not in fifth? 
   So the secret word has at least one E that is not in the fifth position. 
   It could have another E in the fifth? But we don't know.

   However, we want to avoid the fifth position for E because we know that the fifth letter is not E? 
   Actually, the feedback tells us that the fifth letter was not E in the secret word? 
   Our guess ""crane"" had E at the fifth, and it was marked as '-' meaning E is in the word but not at that spot. 
   So the fifth letter of the secret word is not E. Therefore, we should avoid putting E in the fifth again? 
   But we can put it again? It doesn't matter because we are trying to learn more.

   However, we already know E is not in fifth? So we should try E in a different position.

   Let's choose a word with E not in fifth and without C,R,A,N.

   Words with E in position 1: 
      ELBOW -> letters: E, L, B, O, W -> avoids A,C,R,N?
      ELITE -> E, L, I, T, E -> but we use E twice? And avoids C,R,A,N? 
          However, note: we don't know if the secret word has two E's? So it's okay.

   But let's look for words with more common letters.

   Another common letter is T, so I might want to include T.

   Word with E in second position? 
      ""TEETH"" -> E in second and fourth? But T is used twice? 
      But avoids A,C,R,N? 
          Also, we don't know about T? 

   We haven't tested T yet? So we can use T.

   Common starting words with E and avoiding C,R,A,N: 
      ""SLATE"" -> S,L,A,T,E? But A is eliminated -> invalid.
      ""ROAST"" -> has R and A -> invalid.

   How about ""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? But E is at the fourth position? And the fifth letter is L? 

   But note: we need words without A, R, N, C.

   Another: ""BOWEL"": B,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? 

   But we also want to test more new letters.

   Let's list available letters: we haven't used many.

   We know E is present. We have used C,R,A,N,E (from first guess). 

   So available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

   We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter in the secret word.

   Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, S, T, L, O, I, ... but we already know E is there.

   So include S, T, L, O.

   How about a word that has E and S, T, L, O? Without using C,R,A,N.

   Example: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        But note: ""STOLE"" has E at the end? We don't want to put E at the end? 
        Because we know the fifth letter is not E? 
        But we can use it to test other positions? 

        We are forced to put E somewhere? The feedback does not forbid E at the end? 
        We just know that it's not in the fifth position? So putting E at the end again would not help? 
        Because we already know E is present and not at the fifth? 

        However, the secret word might have E at more than one position? 
        We don't know. So by putting E at the end again, if the secret word has two E's? 
        Then we would get '-' for E again? 

        Alternatively, we might learn about other letters.

   Since we have E present, we can try to place it in a different position to see where it goes.

   Why not put E at the beginning? 

   Let me choose ""ELOPS"": but I'm not sure if it's a valid word? 

   Alternatively, ""STOLE"" is valid? But E at the end is redundant? 

   Another word: ""HOMES"" -> H,O,M,E,S -> E is fourth? 
   Also, avoids A,C,R,N? 

   Or ""TIMES"": T,I,M,E,S -> E in fourth? 

   Or ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> E in fifth? We avoid fifth? 

   Let's avoid E in fifth? 

   How about ""TILES"": T,I,L,E,S -> E in fourth? 
   But that's one letter? 

   Another idea: ""FLUID"", but no E? We must include E? Or we don't have to? 
   Actually, we don't have to include E? But note: the feedback only tells us that E is in the word? 
   But we have not confirmed where? So including E in a different position might help locate it.

   However, if we don't include E, we might not get information about E? But we already know E is present? 
   So we can choose words without E? That might help test other letters? 

   The rules say we can guess any valid word? But strategically, we want to find the word quickly.

   Since we know E is present, and we don't know its position, we should try E in a different position? 

   So I think we should put E in one of positions 1 to 4.

   Let me choose a word with E in the first position: 
      ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. 
      This way, if E is in the first position, we get a ✓ for E? Otherwise, if E is not in first, but in the word, we get a '-'? 

   Alternatively, we can put E in a more common position? 

   Common positions for E: not at the end? Then in the middle? 

   According to feedback, E was at fifth and that was wrong? So E must be in 1,2,3,4.

   We can also try E in the second position? 

   Let me pick a word with E in the second position and common letters: 
      ""BELLY"": B,E,L,L,Y -> but double L? 
      ""TEETH"": double E? 
      ""BESTI"": no.

   How about ""METAL""? But A is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""LEMON"": but L,E,M,O,N? We have N? N is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""PETOS"": not a word? 

   Let me think: without A and N, and with E in second? 
      ""HELIO"" is not 5 letters? 
      ""DEUCE"" but D,E,U,C,E? C is eliminated -> invalid.

   Words with E in the third position: 
      ""CRUES"" -> C is eliminated -> invalid?
      ""SPIEL"": S,P,I,E,L -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        E is fourth? Wait: S P I E L -> third letter I, fourth E? 
        We want E in third? 

   Actually: 
      ""GRUEL"" -> G,R,U,E,L? R is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""SUEDE"": S,U,E,D,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. But E in third and fifth? 
        Fifth: we know E is not fifth? So we get '-' for third position? Or if the word has only one E? 

   This is getting messy.

   Since we have eliminated only 4 letters (C,R,A,N) and have 22 left? 

   Let's choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible? And put E in a non-fifth position.

   Example: ""SPIEL"" -> 
        letters: S, P, I, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.
        E is in the fifth? Wait: 
            P-O-S-I-T-I-O-N: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E? Wait, it's S-P-I-E-L -> so E is fourth? 
            So E in fourth position? 
        Then fifth is L? 
        That's fine.

   Or ""TOWED"": T,O,W,E,D -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fourth? 

   Or ""MOVIE"": M,O,V,I,E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fifth? We avoid? 

   So ""SPIEL"" sounds good: 
        S, P, I, E, L -> no duplicates? 

   We'll use that? 

   But note: we must be cautious: E is in fourth position? 

   What if the secret word has E in the first position? Then we would get S,P,I -> all absent? 
   And E as '-', L absent? That might not be informative? 

   Alternatively, we can use a word that starts with E? 

   Let me look for a better word? 

   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E at the end? We avoid? 

   ""STOLE"": E at the end? We avoid? 

   But we can try ""STEEL""? But not 5 distinct letters? 

   How about ""KELP""? Not 5 letters? 

   I think ""QUEST"": Q,U,E,S,T -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in third? 
        But Q is uncommon? 

   Let me go with ""SPIEL"". 

   So we guess ""SPIEL""? 

   But note: we might get more information.

   Alternatively, we can try ""E"", in the first position? 

   Let me decide: 

   Option 1: ""ELTCH"" (not a word) -> no.

   Option 2: ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth? Avoid C,R,A,N? Yes. Letters: E,D,G,E,S -> duplicates E? 
        If we guess it, the duplicate E might be confusing? 
        But the feedback will show: 
            First E: ✓ or -? 
            Fourth E? If the word has only one E and in the first? Then we get E(✓) and then E(x) for fourth? 
            Or if it also has E elsewhere? 

   But we don't know? 

   How about ""STOLE""? Even though E is at the end? We know the fifth letter is not E. 
        But if we put E at the end again, then the feedback for E will be '-', meaning E is present but not at fifth? 
        But we already know that? And we might learn about the other positions? 

        Actually, we haven't tested the fifth letter? We only know it's not E? So we can test other letters? 

        So ""STOLE"" has E at fifth? And we know it's not E? So we expect a '-' for E? 
        But we will learn about S,T,O,L: 
            If any of them are in the word? 

        However, we are testing S,T,O,L? 

        Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" tests S,P,I,E,L? 

        Either is fine? 

   Considering that E is already known to be present? Maybe we can avoid including E? 

   Actually, we have 5 guesses left? And we don't lose much? 

   However, we want to cover common letters? 

   Common letters: S, T, L, O, I are common? 

   So ""STOLE"" tests S,T,O,L,E? 
   But E at fifth: we expect a '-'? 
   Then we would get: 
        S at position 1 -> (✓ or - or x)
        T at 2 -> similarly
        O at 3 -> similarly
        L at 4 -> similarly
        E at 5 -> will be '-' (as expected)

   Since we know E is present? Then regardless of other letters? 

   But we are testing 5 letters? With E being known? 

   Alternatively, I found a word: ""STILE"" (a type of ladder)? S,T,I,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        Also, E is at fifth? And we avoid fifth? 

   But note: we haven't tried words with E not at fifth? 

   Given that we already know E is present and not at fifth, we might try to find E's position by putting it in an early position? 

   Let me choose a word that starts with E? 

   Example: ""ELAND""? Has A? A is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""EDGED""? Doubled E and D? 

   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.
        E in first? 
        This tests E,I,G,H,T? 

   Also, ""INLET"": I,N,L,E,T -> has N? Eliminated? 

   ""EASEL""? has A and E doubled? 

   ""EVITE"": E,V,I,T,E -> avoid? 

   ""ETUDE"": E,T,U,D,E -> avoid duplicates? 

   ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

        So ""EXIST"": E(1), X(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). 
        But T is at fifth? We don't know about T? 

   But note, we don't want to use fifth for E? But fifth here is T? 

   So ""EXIST"" has E at first? 

   I think ""EXIST"" or ""EIGHT""?

   Commonality: S is more common than G and H? 

   So ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> it tests E at first? 

   We might get E(✓) if E is at first? 

   Otherwise, E(-) if E is elsewhere? 

   So let me choose a word like ""EXIST"".

   We have to decide.

   Given the above, I will choose ""EXIST"". 

   So our second guess: ""EXIST""

   But let me see: 
        We avoid C,R,A,N? Yes: E,X,I,S,T doesn't have any of C,R,A,N.

   So guess ""EXIST"".

   Alternatively, if we want to avoid X? because X is rare? 

   Then ""MIDST"" -> M,I,D,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        But doesn't include E? Then we don't test E? 
        But we know E is present? So by not including E, we might get no feedback for E? 
        And then we don't learn about the position? 
        However, we will learn about these letters? 

        But if the word has E, and E is in ""MIDST"", we would not learn its position? 

        Actually, the feedback will still be: 
            If M is not in word -> x
            I -> if in word and in position: ✓ or -? 
            D -> same
            S -> same
            T -> same

        And if E is in the word? It doesn't come up? 

        So we don't get info on E? 

        That's bad because we know E is present? 

        We should include E? 

   Therefore, we must include E? 

   So I go with ""EXIST"" or ""SPIEL""? 

   After consideration, let me choose ""SPIEL"": 
        Reason: It includes E (but not fifth? fourth instead) and avoids C,R,A,N? 
        Also, letters S,P,I,E,L -> common letters? 

   We'll guess ""SPIEL"".

   But note: position of E? In ""SPIEL"" the positions are: 
        1: S
        2: P
        3: I
        4: E
        5: L

   So we are testing E in fourth? 

   If the secret word has E in fourth? We get ✓ for E? 
   Otherwise, if it has E elsewhere? Then '-' for E? 

   But let's hope we get some other hits? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word with E in the first? 

   Since we don't know? But time is short? 

   Another common word: ""POUND"" -> skip because we don't have E? 

   We must include E? 

   So ""QUEUE"" is not helpful? 

   Final: Guess ""SPIEL""

   Or ""E"", first: ""ENTRY"" -> has N? and R? -> invalid.

   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        And E in first? 

   I think ""EIGHT"" is a good word? 

   So I'll choose ""EIGHT""

   Why? It tests E at position 1? And I,G,H,T? 

   We haven't tested G,H,T,I? 

   Common letters: I, T, H are common? 

   Let's do ""EIGHT""

   So guess: ""EIGHT""

   Second guess: ""eight""

   But note: E is at first? 

   We expect if E is first, ✓. If not, then '-' because we know E is present? 

   But what if the secret word has no E at the first? Then we get '-' and we know E is in the word? 

   So this is acceptable.

   We proceed with ""EIGHT"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked as ""-"").

This means:
- The secret word contains the letter E, located in positions 1–4.
- The letters C, R, A, and N must be excluded from all subsequent guesses.

For the next guess:
- We need to include E in a different position (anywhere except the 5th) to help identify its correct location.
- Letters like T, I, G, and H are strong choices because they are common in English words and haven't been tested yet.
- ""EIGHT"" aligns with these criteria: 
  - E is placed in position 1 (testing if E appears there).
  - T, I, G, and H are new letters that maximize information gain.
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

This guess will help narrow down the position of E and test four additional common letters efficiently.

Therefore, we should avoid putting E in the fifth again? \n   But we can put it again? It doesn\'t matter because we are trying to learn more.\n\n   However, we already know E is not in fifth? So we should try E in a different position.\n\n   Let\'s choose a word with E not in fifth and without C,R,A,N.\n\n   Words with E in position 1: \n      ELBOW -> letters: E, L, B, O, W -> avoids A,C,R,N?\n      ELITE -> E, L, I, T, E -> but we use E twice? And avoids C,R,A,N? \n          However, note: we don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s? So it\'s okay.\n\n   But let\'s look for words with more common letters.\n\n   Another common letter is T, so I might want to include T.\n\n   Word with E in second position? \n      ""TEETH"" -> E in second and fourth? But T is used twice? \n      But avoids A,C,R,N? \n          Also, we don\'t know about T? \n\n   We haven\'t tested T yet? So we can use T.\n\n   Common starting words with E and avoiding C,R,A,N: \n      ""SLATE"" -> S,L,A,T,E? But A is eliminated -> invalid.\n      ""ROAST"" -> has R and A -> invalid.\n\n   How about ""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? But E is at the fourth position? And the fifth letter is L? \n\n   But note: we need words without A, R, N, C.\n\n   Another: ""BOWEL"": B,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? \n\n   But we also want to test more new letters.\n\n   Let\'s list available letters: we haven\'t used many.\n\n   We know E is present. We have used C,R,A,N,E (from first guess). \n\n   So available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\n   We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter in the secret word.\n\n   Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, S, T, L, O, I, ... but we already know E is there.\n\n   So include S, T, L, O.\n\n   How about a word that has E and S, T, L, O? Without using C,R,A,N.\n\n   Example: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        But note: ""STOLE"" has E at the end? We don\'t want to put E at the end? \n        Because we know the fifth letter is not E? \n        But we can use it to test other positions? \n\n        We are forced to put E somewhere? The feedback does not forbid E at the end? \n        We just know that it\'s not in the fifth position? So putting E at the end again would not help? \n        Because we already know E is present and not at the fifth? \n\n        However, the secret word might have E at more than one position? \n        We don\'t know. So by putting E at the end again, if the secret word has two E\'s? \n        Then we would get \'-\' for E again? \n\n        Alternatively, we might learn about other letters.\n\n   Since we have E present, we can try to place it in a different position to see where it goes.\n\n   Why not put E at the beginning? \n\n   Let me choose ""ELOPS"": but I\'m not sure if it\'s a valid word? \n\n   Alternatively, ""STOLE"" is valid? But E at the end is redundant? \n\n   Another word: ""HOMES"" -> H,O,M,E,S -> E is fourth? \n   Also, avoids A,C,R,N? \n\n   Or ""TIMES"": T,I,M,E,S -> E in fourth? \n\n   Or ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> E in fifth? We avoid fifth? \n\n   Let\'s avoid E in fifth? \n\n   How about ""TILES"": T,I,L,E,S -> E in fourth? \n   But that\'s one letter? \n\n   Another idea: ""FLUID"", but no E? We must include E? Or we don\'t have to? \n   Actually, we don\'t have to include E? But note: the feedback only tells us that E is in the word? \n   But we have not confirmed where? So including E in a different position might help locate it.\n\n   However, if we don\'t include E, we might not get information about E? But we already know E is present? \n   So we can choose words without E? That might help test other letters? \n\n   The rules say we can guess any valid word? But strategically, we want to find the word quickly.\n\n   Since we know E is present, and we don\'t know its position, we should try E in a different position? \n\n   So I think we should put E in one of positions 1 to 4.\n\n   Let me choose a word with E in the first position: \n      ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. \n      This way, if E is in the first position, we get a ✓ for E? Otherwise, if E is not in first, but in the word, we get a \'-\'? \n\n   Alternatively, we can put E in a more common position? \n\n   Common positions for E: not at the end? Then in the middle? \n\n   According to feedback, E was at fifth and that was wrong? So E must be in 1,2,3,4.\n\n   We can also try E in the second position? \n\n   Let me pick a word with E in the second position and common letters: \n      ""BELLY"": B,E,L,L,Y -> but double L? \n      ""TEETH"": double E? \n      ""BESTI"": no.\n\n   How about ""METAL""? But A is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   ""LEMON"": but L,E,M,O,N? We have N? N is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   ""PETOS"": not a word? \n\n   Let me think: without A and N, and with E in second? \n      ""HELIO"" is not 5 letters? \n      ""DEUCE"" but D,E,U,C,E? C is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   Words with E in the third position: \n      ""CRUES"" -> C is eliminated -> invalid?\n      ""SPIEL"": S,P,I,E,L -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        E is fourth? Wait: S P I E L -> third letter I, fourth E? \n        We want E in third? \n\n   Actually: \n      ""GRUEL"" -> G,R,U,E,L? R is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   ""SUEDE"": S,U,E,D,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. But E in third and fifth? \n        Fifth: we know E is not fifth? So we get \'-\' for third position? Or if the word has only one E? \n\n   This is getting messy.\n\n   Since we have eliminated only 4 letters (C,R,A,N) and have 22 left? \n\n   Let\'s choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible? And put E in a non-fifth position.\n\n   Example: ""SPIEL"" -> \n        letters: S, P, I, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n        E is in the fifth? Wait: \n            P-O-S-I-T-I-O-N: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E? Wait, it\'s S-P-I-E-L -> so E is fourth? \n            So E in fourth position? \n        Then fifth is L? \n        That\'s fine.\n\n   Or ""TOWED"": T,O,W,E,D -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fourth? \n\n   Or ""MOVIE"": M,O,V,I,E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fifth? We avoid? \n\n   So ""SPIEL"" sounds good: \n        S, P, I, E, L -> no duplicates? \n\n   We\'ll use that? \n\n   But note: we must be cautious: E is in fourth position? \n\n   What if the secret word has E in the first position? Then we would get S,P,I -> all absent? \n   And E as \'-\', L absent? That might not be informative? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a word that starts with E? \n\n   Let me look for a better word? \n\n   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E at the end? We avoid? \n\n   ""STOLE"": E at the end? We avoid? \n\n   But we can try ""STEEL""? But not 5 distinct letters? \n\n   How about ""KELP""? Not 5 letters? \n\n   I think ""QUEST"": Q,U,E,S,T -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in third? \n        But Q is uncommon? \n\n   Let me go with ""SPIEL"". \n\n   So we guess ""SPIEL""? \n\n   But note: we might get more information.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""E"", in the first position? \n\n   Let me decide: \n\n   Option 1: ""ELTCH"" (not a word) -> no.\n\n   Option 2: ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth? Avoid C,R,A,N? Yes. Letters: E,D,G,E,S -> duplicates E? \n        If we guess it, the duplicate E might be confusing? \n        But the feedback will show: \n            First E: ✓ or -? \n            Fourth E? If the word has only one E and in the first? Then we get E(✓) and then E(x) for fourth? \n            Or if it also has E elsewhere? \n\n   But we don\'t know? \n\n   How about ""STOLE""? Even though E is at the end? We know the fifth letter is not E. \n        But if we put E at the end again, then the feedback for E will be \'-\', meaning E is present but not at fifth? \n        But we already know that? And we might learn about the other positions? \n\n        Actually, we haven\'t tested the fifth letter? We only know it\'s not E? So we can test other letters? \n\n        So ""STOLE"" has E at fifth? And we know it\'s not E? So we expect a \'-\' for E? \n        But we will learn about S,T,O,L: \n            If any of them are in the word? \n\n        However, we are testing S,T,O,L? \n\n        Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" tests S,P,I,E,L? \n\n        Either is fine? \n\n   Considering that E is already known to be present? Maybe we can avoid including E? \n\n   Actually, we have 5 guesses left? And we don\'t lose much? \n\n   However, we want to cover common letters? \n\n   Common letters: S, T, L, O, I are common? \n\n   So ""STOLE"" tests S,T,O,L,E? \n   But E at fifth: we expect a \'-\'? \n   Then we would get: \n        S at position 1 -> (✓ or - or x)\n        T at 2 -> similarly\n        O at 3 -> similarly\n        L at 4 -> similarly\n        E at 5 -> will be \'-\' (as expected)\n\n   Since we know E is present? Then regardless of other letters? \n\n   But we are testing 5 letters? With E being known? \n\n   Alternatively, I found a word: ""STILE"" (a type of ladder)? S,T,I,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        Also, E is at fifth? And we avoid fifth? \n\n   But note: we haven\'t tried words with E not at fifth? \n\n   Given that we already know E is present and not at fifth, we might try to find E\'s position by putting it in an early position? \n\n   Let me choose a word that starts with E? \n\n   Example: ""ELAND""? Has A? A is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   ""EDGED""? Doubled E and D? \n\n   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n        E in first? \n        This tests E,I,G,H,T? \n\n   Also, ""INLET"": I,N,L,E,T -> has N? Eliminated? \n\n   ""EASEL""? has A and E doubled? \n\n   ""EVITE"": E,V,I,T,E -> avoid? \n\n   ""ETUDE"": E,T,U,D,E -> avoid duplicates? \n\n   ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\n        So ""EXIST"": E(1), X(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). \n        But T is at fifth? We don\'t know about T? \n\n   But note, we don\'t want to use fifth for E? But fifth here is T? \n\n   So ""EXIST"" has E at first? \n\n   I think ""EXIST"" or ""EIGHT""?\n\n   Commonality: S is more common than G and H? \n\n   So ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> it tests E at first? \n\n   We might get E(✓) if E is at first? \n\n   Otherwise, E(-) if E is elsewhere? \n\n   So let me choose a word like ""EXIST"".\n\n   We have to decide.\n\n   Given the above, I will choose ""EXIST"". \n\n   So our second guess: ""EXIST""\n\n   But let me see: \n        We avoid C,R,A,N? Yes: E,X,I,S,T doesn\'t have any of C,R,A,N.\n\n   So guess ""EXIST"".\n\n   Alternatively, if we want to avoid X? because X is rare? \n\n   Then ""MIDST"" -> M,I,D,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        But doesn\'t include E? Then we don\'t test E? \n        But we know E is present? So by not including E, we might get no feedback for E? \n        And then we don\'t learn about the position? \n        However, we will learn about these letters? \n\n        But if the word has E, and E is in ""MIDST"", we would not learn its position? \n\n        Actually, the feedback will still be: \n            If M is not in word -> x\n            I -> if in word and in position: ✓ or -? \n            D -> same\n            S -> same\n            T -> same\n\n        And if E is in the word? It doesn\'t come up? \n\n        So we don\'t get info on E? \n\n        That\'s bad because we know E is present? \n\n        We should include E? \n\n   Therefore, we must include E? \n\n   So I go with ""EXIST"" or ""SPIEL""? \n\n   After consideration, let me choose ""SPIEL"": \n        Reason: It includes E (but not fifth? fourth instead) and avoids C,R,A,N? \n        Also, letters S,P,I,E,L -> common letters? \n\n   We\'ll guess ""SPIEL"".\n\n   But note: position of E? In ""SPIEL"" the positions are: \n        1: S\n        2: P\n        3: I\n        4: E\n        5: L\n\n   So we are testing E in fourth? \n\n   If the secret word has E in fourth? We get ✓ for E? \n   Otherwise, if it has E elsewhere? Then \'-\' for E? \n\n   But let\'s hope we get some other hits? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word with E in the first? \n\n   Since we don\'t know? But time is short? \n\n   Another common word: ""POUND"" -> skip because we don\'t have E? \n\n   We must include E? \n\n   So ""QUEUE"" is not helpful? \n\n   Final: Guess ""SPIEL""\n\n   Or ""E"", first: ""ENTRY"" -> has N? and R? -> invalid.\n\n   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        And E in first? \n\n   I think ""EIGHT"" is a good word? \n\n   So I\'ll choose ""EIGHT""\n\n   Why? It tests E at position 1? And I,G,H,T? \n\n   We haven\'t tested G,H,T,I? \n\n   Common letters: I, T, H are common? \n\n   Let\'s do ""EIGHT""\n\n   So guess: ""EIGHT""\n\n   Second guess: ""eight""\n\n   But note: E is at first? \n\n   We expect if E is first, ✓. If not, then \'-\' because we know E is present? \n\n   But what if the secret word has no E at the first? Then we get \'-\' and we know E is in the word? \n\n   So this is acceptable.\n\n   We proceed with ""EIGHT"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked as ""x"").\n- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked as ""-"").\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word contains the letter E, located in positions 1–4.\n- The letters C, R, A, and N must be excluded from all subsequent guesses.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- We need to include E in a different position (anywhere except the 5th) to help identify its correct location.\n- Letters like T, I, G, and H are strong choices because they are common in English words and haven\'t been tested yet.\n- ""EIGHT"" aligns with these criteria: \n  - E is placed in position 1 (testing if E appears there).\n  - T, I, G, and H are new letters that maximize information gain.\n  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of E and test four additional common letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>eight</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
  C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.
  E is present but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
Meaning:
  E is present but not in the 1st position (since we guessed it in the first position and got '-'). 
  I is present and in the correct position (2nd position, because in ""eight"", I is the second letter).
  G, H, T are absent.

So from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T
Present letters: E (but not in 1st or 5th position) and I (which is in the 2nd position).

Therefore, the secret word has:
  - The second letter is I.
  - The letter E is present, but not in the 1st, 2nd (because second is I), or 5th position. So E must be in the 3rd or 4th position.

We also know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

We have 4 tries left.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
  - Has 5 letters, all from the remaining possible letters (excluding absent ones).
  - Must have I in the second position.
  - Must include E in either the 3rd or 4th position (to check which one).
  - Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

Available letters: 
  We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, G, H, T (from the two guesses). 
  But note: E and I are present, so they are still in play (but we know I is fixed at position 2).

  The alphabet without the absent letters: 
    B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

  And we know E must be included (but not in 1st, 2nd, or 5th) and I is fixed at position 2.

So the secret word pattern is: 
  Position 1: one of B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but not E, because E is not in 1st)
  Position 2: I (fixed)
  Position 3: either E or one of the available letters? But note: E must be in the word, and it can only be in 3rd or 4th. So either position 3 or 4 must be E.
  Position 4: similarly, if E is not in 3rd, then it must be in 4th.
  Position 5: one of the available letters (but not E, because E is not in 5th).

We can try to form a word that has I in the second position and E in the third position? Or in the fourth?

We should also try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Option 1: Assume E is in the 3rd position -> pattern: _ I E _ _
Option 2: Assume E is in the 4th position -> pattern: _ I _ E _

We don't know which, so we can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in the 3rd position and then if it's not there, we know it must be in the 4th? 

But we can also choose a word that doesn't have E at all? But we must include E because we know it's present? 

Wait, we must include E? Actually, we don't have to? But if we don't include E, then we won't get information about E's position? 

But we know E is present? So if we don't include E, we will get all the other letters' feedback, but we won't learn about E? 

However, we can still get the feedback for the letters we do include? 

But we have limited guesses? So it's better to include E to try to locate it? 

So let's include E in either the 3rd or 4th position? 

We can choose a word that has E in the 3rd position? 

For example: 
  Pattern: _ I E _ _

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with available letters.

Available letters: B,D,F,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: S, L, O, P, D, etc.

Example words: 
  ""SIEVE"" -> S I E V E -> but E is in 3rd and 5th? But we cannot have E in 5th? 
      Also, V is present? 
      But note: we are going to put E in 3rd? and 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? So we cannot use E in 5th? 
      So ""SIEVE"" is invalid because it has E in 5th? 

  ""SIEVE"" is not allowed? Because we know E is not in 5th? So we must avoid E in 5th? 

  ""DIET_"" -> but we need 5 letters? ""DIETS"" -> D I E T S -> but T is absent? T is eliminated? 

  ""LIEU_"" -> ""LIEUS"" (a word? meaning a unit of the French currency) -> L I E U S -> avoids absent letters? 
        Letters: L, I, E, U, S -> all allowed? 
        But E is in 3rd? 
        And no E in 5th? 

  ""BIELD"" (Scottish word for shelter) -> B I E L D -> avoids absent letters? 
        B, I, E, L, D -> all allowed? 

  ""PIECE"" -> P I E C E -> but C is absent? 

  ""FIELD"" -> F I E L D -> avoids absent letters? 
        F, I, E, L, D -> all allowed? 

  ""WIELD"" -> W I E L D -> same.

  ""PIEZO"" -> P I E Z O -> avoids absent? 

But note: we are not sure if these words are in the word list? 

Alternatively, we can try E in the 4th position? 

Pattern: _ I _ E _

Example: 
  ""SIRED"" -> S I R E D -> but R is absent? 
  ""FILED"" -> F I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        F, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 

  ""MILER"" -> M I L E R -> R absent? 
  ""BIDES"" -> B I D E S -> avoids absent? 

  ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S -> avoids absent? 

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

We can choose either pattern? 

But we want to maximize information? 

We know that E is either in 3rd or 4th? So if we choose a word with E in 3rd, we can test that hypothesis? 

If we get E(✓) in 3rd, then we know E is in 3rd? 
If we get E(-) in 3rd, then E is not in 3rd? So it must be in 4th? 

Similarly, if we put E in 4th? 

So either way, we can get the position? 

But we also want to test other letters? 

So let's choose a word that has E in 3rd and has common letters? 

I'll go with ""FIELD"": F I E L D -> 
  F: new letter
  I: already known to be in second? so we expect ✓ for I? 
  E: in 3rd? we test if E is in 3rd? 
  L: new letter? 
  D: new letter? 

But note: we are using F, L, D? 

Alternatively, ""WIELD"": W I E L D -> same? 

But ""FIELD"" is more common? 

However, we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't know? 

But we haven't seen any repeated letters so far? 

Another idea: we can choose a word that has E in 3rd and also includes other common letters? 

But we have limited letters? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in 4th? 

But let's stick with E in 3rd? 

I choose ""FIELD"". 

But wait: what if the secret word is ""FIELD""? Then we win? 

But we don't know? 

But let's see: 
  If we guess ""FIELD"", and the secret word has E in 3rd? Then we get:
      F: ? 
      I: ✓ (because second is I)
      E: ✓ (if E is in 3rd) 
      L: ? 
      D: ?

  If the secret word is ""FIELD"", then we get all ✓? 

  But if not, we get feedback on F, L, D? 

  Also, if E is not in 3rd, then we get E(-) meaning E is present but not in 3rd? Then we know E must be in 4th? 

So it's a good test? 

But note: we are using F, L, D? 

We could use more common letters? 

Common letters: S, O, L, D, etc. 

How about ""SILED""? Not a common word? 

""OILED"": O I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        O, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 
        But E is in 4th? 

But we are testing E in 4th? 

We can do that? 

But we don't know if E is in 3rd or 4th? 

So if we choose ""OILED"", we are testing E in 4th? 

If we get E(✓) in 4th, then we know E is in 4th? 
If we get E(-) in 4th, then E is not in 4th? So it must be in 3rd? 

So both ""FIELD"" (E in 3rd) and ""OILED"" (E in 4th) are valid? 

But we can only choose one? 

I think we should choose one that uses more common letters? 

""OILED"" has O, L, D? 

""FIELD"" has F, L, D? 

O is more common than F? 

But we don't know? 

Another word: ""SIDLE"": S I D L E -> but E is in 5th? Not allowed? 

""QUIET"": Q U I E T -> T is absent? 

""JUICY"": J U I C Y -> C absent? 

""PILED"": P I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        P, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 
        E in 4th? 

""PILED"" is a word? 

Similarly, ""WIPED"": W I P E D -> avoids absent? 

But we have to avoid T? 

I think ""PILED"" is a good choice? 

But let me compare:

  ""FIELD"": tests E in 3rd, and letters F, L, D? 
  ""PILED"": tests E in 4th, and letters P, L, D? 

We already know I is in second? 

In ""PILED"", the I is in second? So we expect I(✓). 

We can choose either? 

But note: we haven't tested S? S is a very common letter? 

So maybe we should include S? 

Pattern for E in 3rd: _ I E _ _ 
  With S: 
      Position 1: S -> ""SIE??"" 
      We need two more letters? 
      Example: ""SIEVE"" -> invalid because of E at the end? 
      ""SIEGE"" -> S I E G E -> but G is absent? 
      ""SIECE"" -> not a word? 
      ""SIELD"" -> not a word? 
      ""SIEUR"" -> S I E U R -> R is absent? 

Pattern for E in 4th: _ I _ E _ 
  With S: 
      ""S I ? E ?"" 
      Example: ""SIRED"" -> R absent? 
      ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S -> avoids absent? 
          D is allowed? 
          But note: S is used twice? 
          Also, E is in 4th? 
          And fifth is S? 
          So ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S? 
          But we don't know if the word allows duplicates? 

      ""SINES"" -> S I N E S -> N is absent? 
      ""SILES"" -> not a word? 
      ""SITES"" -> T is absent? 
      ""SIVES"" -> not common? 

  ""SIXES"" -> S I X E S -> avoids absent? 
        But X is allowed? 
        And S is duplicated? 

  ""SIZES"" -> S I Z E S -> avoids absent? 

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

The rules don't say? But in Wordle, duplicates are allowed? 

But in our feedback, we haven't seen any duplicates? 

But the secret word might have duplicates? 

However, to be safe, we can avoid duplicates? 

So ""SIDES"" is a word? And it has two S's? 

But we are testing S in first and fifth? 

If the secret word has only one S? Then we might get S(✓) and S(x) for the fifth? 

But it's acceptable? 

But we are not sure? 

Alternatively, without duplicates: 

  ""SIXES"" has two S's? 

  ""SIXTH"" -> T and H absent? 

  ""SIXTY"" -> T absent? 

  ""SILED"" -> S I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        S, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 
        E in 4th? 

  ""SILED"" is a word? (past tense of sile: to descend, as a hawk) 

  But not common? 

  ""SIPED"" -> not a word? 

  ""SIMES"" -> not a word? 

  ""SIBYL"" -> S I B Y L -> avoids absent? 
        But no E? We must include E? 

  We must include E? 

  So ""SILED"" is acceptable? 

  But we are testing E in 4th? 

  Similarly, we can do ""SIDED"" -> but D repeated? 

  ""SIDED"" has two D's? 

  ""SIDLE"" -> S I D L E -> E in fifth? Not allowed? 

So I think ""SILED"" is acceptable? 

But to use common words, I'll avoid ""SILED"". 

Another common word: ""DOILY"" -> no E? 

We must include E? 

So I think ""PILED"" is a common word? 

I'll go with ""PILED"": 
  P I L E D 
  This tests:
      P in first? 
      I in second: ✓ (we know)
      L in third? 
      E in fourth? 
      D in fifth? 

  If E is in fourth, we get E(✓) and then we know the position? 
  If E is not in fourth, we get E(-) meaning E is present but not in fourth? Then we know E must be in third? 

  Also, we test P, L, D? 

  So we get information on three new letters? 

  And we avoid the absent letters? 

  So I choose ""PILED"". 

But note: we are testing E in the fourth position? 

Alternatively, we can test E in the third? 

But we have to choose one? 

I think it's symmetric? 

So I'll go with ""PILED"". 

Guess: ""PILED""

But let me confirm: 
  We have not used P, L, D before? 
  And we avoid C,R,A,N,G,H,T? 

Yes.

So <guess>piled</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A, N are absent (x), E is present but not in the 5th position (-).
- **Guess 2: ""eight""** → E is present but not in the 1st position (-), I is correct and in the 2nd position (✓), and G, H, T are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
1. **I is fixed in the 2nd position** of the secret word.
2. **E is present** but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since position 2 is I, and E was misplaced in positions 1 and 5). Thus, E must be in **position 3 or 4**.
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T (cannot be used).
4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **E in the 4th position** to narrow down its location (if E is not in the 4th, it must be in the 3rd).
- Include **new common letters** (P, L, D) to maximize information.
- Use a valid word that fits the pattern `_ I _ E _` and avoids absent letters.

The word **""PILED""** is chosen because:
- It places I in the 2nd position (✓, as required).
- It tests E in the 4th position (if E is here, it will be ✓; if not, E must be in the 3rd).
- It introduces three new common letters (P, L, D) to check for presence/position.
- It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, N, G, H, T).

<guess>piled</guess>",piled,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
  C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.
  E is present but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
Meaning:
  E is present but not in the 1st position (since we guessed it in the first position and got '-'). 
  I is present and in the correct position (2nd position, because in ""eight"", I is the second letter).
  G, H, T are absent.

So from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T
Present letters: E (but not in 1st or 5th position) and I (which is in the 2nd position).

Therefore, the secret word has:
  - The second letter is I.
  - The letter E is present, but not in the 1st, 2nd (because second is I), or 5th position. So E must be in the 3rd or 4th position.

We also know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

We have 4 tries left.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
  - Has 5 letters, all from the remaining possible letters (excluding absent ones).
  - Must have I in the second position.
  - Must include E in either the 3rd or 4th position (to check which one).
  - Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

Available letters: 
  We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, G, H, T (from the two guesses). 
  But note: E and I are present, so they are still in play (but we know I is fixed at position 2).

  The alphabet without the absent letters: 
    B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

  And we know E must be included (but not in 1st, 2nd, or 5th) and I is fixed at position 2.

So the secret word pattern is: 
  Position 1: one of B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but not E, because E is not in 1st)
  Position 2: I (fixed)
  Position 3: either E or one of the available letters? But note: E must be in the word, and it can only be in 3rd or 4th. So either position 3 or 4 must be E.
  Position 4: similarly, if E is not in 3rd, then it must be in 4th.
  Position 5: one of the available letters (but not E, because E is not in 5th).

We can try to form a word that has I in the second position and E in the third position? Or in the fourth?

We should also try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Option 1: Assume E is in the 3rd position -> pattern: _ I E _ _
Option 2: Assume E is in the 4th position -> pattern: _ I _ E _

We don't know which, so we can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in the 3rd position and then if it's not there, we know it must be in the 4th? 

But we can also choose a word that doesn't have E at all? But we must include E because we know it's present? 

Wait, we must include E? Actually, we don't have to? But if we don't include E, then we won't get information about E's position? 

But we know E is present? So if we don't include E, we will get all the other letters' feedback, but we won't learn about E? 

However, we can still get the feedback for the letters we do include? 

But we have limited guesses? So it's better to include E to try to locate it? 

So let's include E in either the 3rd or 4th position? 

We can choose a word that has E in the 3rd position? 

For example: 
  Pattern: _ I E _ _

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with available letters.

Available letters: B,D,F,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: S, L, O, P, D, etc.

Example words: 
  ""SIEVE"" -> S I E V E -> but E is in 3rd and 5th? But we cannot have E in 5th? 
      Also, V is present? 
      But note: we are going to put E in 3rd? and 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? So we cannot use E in 5th? 
      So ""SIEVE"" is invalid because it has E in 5th? 

  ""SIEVE"" is not allowed? Because we know E is not in 5th? So we must avoid E in 5th? 

  ""DIET_"" -> but we need 5 letters? ""DIETS"" -> D I E T S -> but T is absent? T is eliminated? 

  ""LIEU_"" -> ""LIEUS"" (a word? meaning a unit of the French currency) -> L I E U S -> avoids absent letters? 
        Letters: L, I, E, U, S -> all allowed? 
        But E is in 3rd? 
        And no E in 5th? 

  ""BIELD"" (Scottish word for shelter) -> B I E L D -> avoids absent letters? 
        B, I, E, L, D -> all allowed? 

  ""PIECE"" -> P I E C E -> but C is absent? 

  ""FIELD"" -> F I E L D -> avoids absent letters? 
        F, I, E, L, D -> all allowed? 

  ""WIELD"" -> W I E L D -> same.

  ""PIEZO"" -> P I E Z O -> avoids absent? 

But note: we are not sure if these words are in the word list? 

Alternatively, we can try E in the 4th position? 

Pattern: _ I _ E _

Example: 
  ""SIRED"" -> S I R E D -> but R is absent? 
  ""FILED"" -> F I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        F, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 

  ""MILER"" -> M I L E R -> R absent? 
  ""BIDES"" -> B I D E S -> avoids absent? 

  ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S -> avoids absent? 

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

We can choose either pattern? 

But we want to maximize information? 

We know that E is either in 3rd or 4th? So if we choose a word with E in 3rd, we can test that hypothesis? 

If we get E(✓) in 3rd, then we know E is in 3rd? 
If we get E(-) in 3rd, then E is not in 3rd? So it must be in 4th? 

Similarly, if we put E in 4th? 

So either way, we can get the position? 

But we also want to test other letters? 

So let's choose a word that has E in 3rd and has common letters? 

I'll go with ""FIELD"": F I E L D -> 
  F: new letter
  I: already known to be in second? so we expect ✓ for I? 
  E: in 3rd? we test if E is in 3rd? 
  L: new letter? 
  D: new letter? 

But note: we are using F, L, D? 

Alternatively, ""WIELD"": W I E L D -> same? 

But ""FIELD"" is more common? 

However, we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't know? 

But we haven't seen any repeated letters so far? 

Another idea: we can choose a word that has E in 3rd and also includes other common letters? 

But we have limited letters? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in 4th? 

But let's stick with E in 3rd? 

I choose ""FIELD"". 

But wait: what if the secret word is ""FIELD""? Then we win? 

But we don't know? 

But let's see: 
  If we guess ""FIELD"", and the secret word has E in 3rd? Then we get:
      F: ? 
      I: ✓ (because second is I)
      E: ✓ (if E is in 3rd) 
      L: ? 
      D: ?

  If the secret word is ""FIELD"", then we get all ✓? 

  But if not, we get feedback on F, L, D? 

  Also, if E is not in 3rd, then we get E(-) meaning E is present but not in 3rd? Then we know E must be in 4th? 

So it's a good test? 

But note: we are using F, L, D? 

We could use more common letters? 

Common letters: S, O, L, D, etc. 

How about ""SILED""? Not a common word? 

""OILED"": O I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        O, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 
        But E is in 4th? 

But we are testing E in 4th? 

We can do that? 

But we don't know if E is in 3rd or 4th? 

So if we choose ""OILED"", we are testing E in 4th? 

If we get E(✓) in 4th, then we know E is in 4th? 
If we get E(-) in 4th, then E is not in 4th? So it must be in 3rd? 

So both ""FIELD"" (E in 3rd) and ""OILED"" (E in 4th) are valid? 

But we can only choose one? 

I think we should choose one that uses more common letters? 

""OILED"" has O, L, D? 

""FIELD"" has F, L, D? 

O is more common than F? 

But we don't know? 

Another word: ""SIDLE"": S I D L E -> but E is in 5th? Not allowed? 

""QUIET"": Q U I E T -> T is absent? 

""JUICY"": J U I C Y -> C absent? 

""PILED"": P I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        P, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 
        E in 4th? 

""PILED"" is a word? 

Similarly, ""WIPED"": W I P E D -> avoids absent? 

But we have to avoid T? 

I think ""PILED"" is a good choice? 

But let me compare:

  ""FIELD"": tests E in 3rd, and letters F, L, D? 
  ""PILED"": tests E in 4th, and letters P, L, D? 

We already know I is in second? 

In ""PILED"", the I is in second? So we expect I(✓). 

We can choose either? 

But note: we haven't tested S? S is a very common letter? 

So maybe we should include S? 

Pattern for E in 3rd: _ I E _ _ 
  With S: 
      Position 1: S -> ""SIE??"" 
      We need two more letters? 
      Example: ""SIEVE"" -> invalid because of E at the end? 
      ""SIEGE"" -> S I E G E -> but G is absent? 
      ""SIECE"" -> not a word? 
      ""SIELD"" -> not a word? 
      ""SIEUR"" -> S I E U R -> R is absent? 

Pattern for E in 4th: _ I _ E _ 
  With S: 
      ""S I ? E ?"" 
      Example: ""SIRED"" -> R absent? 
      ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S -> avoids absent? 
          D is allowed? 
          But note: S is used twice? 
          Also, E is in 4th? 
          And fifth is S? 
          So ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S? 
          But we don't know if the word allows duplicates? 

      ""SINES"" -> S I N E S -> N is absent? 
      ""SILES"" -> not a word? 
      ""SITES"" -> T is absent? 
      ""SIVES"" -> not common? 

  ""SIXES"" -> S I X E S -> avoids absent? 
        But X is allowed? 
        And S is duplicated? 

  ""SIZES"" -> S I Z E S -> avoids absent? 

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

The rules don't say? But in Wordle, duplicates are allowed? 

But in our feedback, we haven't seen any duplicates? 

But the secret word might have duplicates? 

However, to be safe, we can avoid duplicates? 

So ""SIDES"" is a word? And it has two S's? 

But we are testing S in first and fifth? 

If the secret word has only one S? Then we might get S(✓) and S(x) for the fifth? 

But it's acceptable? 

But we are not sure? 

Alternatively, without duplicates: 

  ""SIXES"" has two S's? 

  ""SIXTH"" -> T and H absent? 

  ""SIXTY"" -> T absent? 

  ""SILED"" -> S I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        S, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 
        E in 4th? 

  ""SILED"" is a word? (past tense of sile: to descend, as a hawk) 

  But not common? 

  ""SIPED"" -> not a word? 

  ""SIMES"" -> not a word? 

  ""SIBYL"" -> S I B Y L -> avoids absent? 
        But no E? We must include E? 

  We must include E? 

  So ""SILED"" is acceptable? 

  But we are testing E in 4th? 

  Similarly, we can do ""SIDED"" -> but D repeated? 

  ""SIDED"" has two D's? 

  ""SIDLE"" -> S I D L E -> E in fifth? Not allowed? 

So I think ""SILED"" is acceptable? 

But to use common words, I'll avoid ""SILED"". 

Another common word: ""DOILY"" -> no E? 

We must include E? 

So I think ""PILED"" is a common word? 

I'll go with ""PILED"": 
  P I L E D 
  This tests:
      P in first? 
      I in second: ✓ (we know)
      L in third? 
      E in fourth? 
      D in fifth? 

  If E is in fourth, we get E(✓) and then we know the position? 
  If E is not in fourth, we get E(-) meaning E is present but not in fourth? Then we know E must be in third? 

  Also, we test P, L, D? 

  So we get information on three new letters? 

  And we avoid the absent letters? 

  So I choose ""PILED"". 

But note: we are testing E in the fourth position? 

Alternatively, we can test E in the third? 

But we have to choose one? 

I think it's symmetric? 

So I'll go with ""PILED"". 

Guess: ""PILED""

But let me confirm: 
  We have not used P, L, D before? 
  And we avoid C,R,A,N,G,H,T? 

Yes.

So <guess>piled</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A, N are absent (x), E is present but not in the 5th position (-).
- **Guess 2: ""eight""** → E is present but not in the 1st position (-), I is correct and in the 2nd position (✓), and G, H, T are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
1. **I is fixed in the 2nd position** of the secret word.
2. **E is present** but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since position 2 is I, and E was misplaced in positions 1 and 5). Thus, E must be in **position 3 or 4**.
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T (cannot be used).
4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **E in the 4th position** to narrow down its location (if E is not in the 4th, it must be in the 3rd).
- Include **new common letters** (P, L, D) to maximize information.
- Use a valid word that fits the pattern `_ I _ E _` and avoids absent letters.

The word **""PILED""** is chosen because:

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,libel,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 Since C, R, A, and N are all absent, we know that the secret word does not contain these letters.

 The feedback for E was a '-' meaning E is in the word but not in the fifth position (since we guessed it in the fifth position).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, but not at the end. Also, it does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 We have 5 tries left.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Is a 5-letter English word.
 - Avoids the letters C, R, A, N because they are absent.
 - Must contain E (since E is present) but not in the fifth position.

 Additionally, we can use common letters to maximize information.

 Since we know E is in the word, we can try to place E in a different position.

 Common consonants remaining: we can use letters like S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 Let's choose a word that has E in a different position and avoids C,R,A,N.

 We also note that the secret word has E, but not in the fifth position. So E must be in one of positions 1-4.

 Possible starting words: We need a word without C,R,A,N.

 Some options: 
   We could try ""SPIEL"", but let's think of words that have E and other common letters.

 Another idea: ""HOUSE"" -> but note that E is at the end, and we know E isn't at the end? 
   However, our feedback says E is in the word but not in the fifth position. So we cannot put E in the fifth position again.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end? But we are not allowed to put E at the end? 
   Actually, we can put E at the end again? Let me clarify: The feedback says E is present but not in the fifth position. 
   That is, in this particular word, E was in the fifth position and it was wrong. 
   But E might appear more than once? The feedback does not indicate multiple E's. 
   However, the secret word might have only one E? 

 So when we guess, we can try E in a different position. Avoiding fifth.

 Let me avoid E in the fifth position.

 Some words without E at the end:

   First position: ""EAGLE"" -> but A is already eliminated? We know A is not in the word, so ""EAGLE"" has A which is bad.

   Second position: like ""LEMON"" -> but L,E,M,O,N? Wait, N is eliminated! So we cannot use N.

   Third position: ""PLUME"" -> E at the end? Not good.

   Fourth position: ""SMILE"" -> E at the end? Not good.

 We need E not in the fifth. So positions 1,2,3,4.

 Let me think of words with E in the first position that do not contain C,R,A,N.

 Examples: 
   ""EAGLE"" has A -> invalid because A is absent.
   ""EERIE"" has multiple E's? And avoids A,C,N,R? But it has R? Wait, R is absent so we cannot use R? 
   Actually, R is absent so we cannot include R. ""EERIE"" has R? No: EERIE has letters E, E, R, I, E? 
   Actually: E E R I E? That has R? So avoid.

   ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth positions? And avoids A,C,R,N? Letters: E, D, G, E, S -> no C,R,A,N.

   But we don't know if the word has multiple E's? We only know there is at least one E. 
   However, we are trying to maximize new information.

   Another word: ""EBONY"" -> has N? No, we know N is absent. So avoid N.

   ""ELOPE"": Letters: E, L, O, P, E -> avoids C,R,A,N? And E in first and fifth? But we know E is not in fifth? 
   We are not sure about fifth? Actually, our feedback said E is present but not in fifth? 
   So the secret word has at least one E that is not in the fifth position. 
   It could have another E in the fifth? But we don't know.

   However, we want to avoid the fifth position for E because we know that the fifth letter is not E? 
   Actually, the feedback tells us that the fifth letter was not E in the secret word? 
   Our guess ""crane"" had E at the fifth, and it was marked as '-' meaning E is in the word but not at that spot. 
   So the fifth letter of the secret word is not E. Therefore, we should avoid putting E in the fifth again? 
   But we can put it again? It doesn't matter because we are trying to learn more.

   However, we already know E is not in fifth? So we should try E in a different position.

   Let's choose a word with E not in fifth and without C,R,A,N.

   Words with E in position 1: 
      ELBOW -> letters: E, L, B, O, W -> avoids A,C,R,N?
      ELITE -> E, L, I, T, E -> but we use E twice? And avoids C,R,A,N? 
          However, note: we don't know if the secret word has two E's? So it's okay.

   But let's look for words with more common letters.

   Another common letter is T, so I might want to include T.

   Word with E in second position? 
      ""TEETH"" -> E in second and fourth? But T is used twice? 
      But avoids A,C,R,N? 
          Also, we don't know about T? 

   We haven't tested T yet? So we can use T.

   Common starting words with E and avoiding C,R,A,N: 
      ""SLATE"" -> S,L,A,T,E? But A is eliminated -> invalid.
      ""ROAST"" -> has R and A -> invalid.

   How about ""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? But E is at the fourth position? And the fifth letter is L? 

   But note: we need words without A, R, N, C.

   Another: ""BOWEL"": B,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? 

   But we also want to test more new letters.

   Let's list available letters: we haven't used many.

   We know E is present. We have used C,R,A,N,E (from first guess). 

   So available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

   We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter in the secret word.

   Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, S, T, L, O, I, ... but we already know E is there.

   So include S, T, L, O.

   How about a word that has E and S, T, L, O? Without using C,R,A,N.

   Example: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        But note: ""STOLE"" has E at the end? We don't want to put E at the end? 
        Because we know the fifth letter is not E? 
        But we can use it to test other positions? 

        We are forced to put E somewhere? The feedback does not forbid E at the end? 
        We just know that it's not in the fifth position? So putting E at the end again would not help? 
        Because we already know E is present and not at the fifth? 

        However, the secret word might have E at more than one position? 
        We don't know. So by putting E at the end again, if the secret word has two E's? 
        Then we would get '-' for E again? 

        Alternatively, we might learn about other letters.

   Since we have E present, we can try to place it in a different position to see where it goes.

   Why not put E at the beginning? 

   Let me choose ""ELOPS"": but I'm not sure if it's a valid word? 

   Alternatively, ""STOLE"" is valid? But E at the end is redundant? 

   Another word: ""HOMES"" -> H,O,M,E,S -> E is fourth? 
   Also, avoids A,C,R,N? 

   Or ""TIMES"": T,I,M,E,S -> E in fourth? 

   Or ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> E in fifth? We avoid fifth? 

   Let's avoid E in fifth? 

   How about ""TILES"": T,I,L,E,S -> E in fourth? 
   But that's one letter? 

   Another idea: ""FLUID"", but no E? We must include E? Or we don't have to? 
   Actually, we don't have to include E? But note: the feedback only tells us that E is in the word? 
   But we have not confirmed where? So including E in a different position might help locate it.

   However, if we don't include E, we might not get information about E? But we already know E is present? 
   So we can choose words without E? That might help test other letters? 

   The rules say we can guess any valid word? But strategically, we want to find the word quickly.

   Since we know E is present, and we don't know its position, we should try E in a different position? 

   So I think we should put E in one of positions 1 to 4.

   Let me choose a word with E in the first position: 
      ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. 
      This way, if E is in the first position, we get a ✓ for E? Otherwise, if E is not in first, but in the word, we get a '-'? 

   Alternatively, we can put E in a more common position? 

   Common positions for E: not at the end? Then in the middle? 

   According to feedback, E was at fifth and that was wrong? So E must be in 1,2,3,4.

   We can also try E in the second position? 

   Let me pick a word with E in the second position and common letters: 
      ""BELLY"": B,E,L,L,Y -> but double L? 
      ""TEETH"": double E? 
      ""BESTI"": no.

   How about ""METAL""? But A is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""LEMON"": but L,E,M,O,N? We have N? N is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""PETOS"": not a word? 

   Let me think: without A and N, and with E in second? 
      ""HELIO"" is not 5 letters? 
      ""DEUCE"" but D,E,U,C,E? C is eliminated -> invalid.

   Words with E in the third position: 
      ""CRUES"" -> C is eliminated -> invalid?
      ""SPIEL"": S,P,I,E,L -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        E is fourth? Wait: S P I E L -> third letter I, fourth E? 
        We want E in third? 

   Actually: 
      ""GRUEL"" -> G,R,U,E,L? R is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""SUEDE"": S,U,E,D,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. But E in third and fifth? 
        Fifth: we know E is not fifth? So we get '-' for third position? Or if the word has only one E? 

   This is getting messy.

   Since we have eliminated only 4 letters (C,R,A,N) and have 22 left? 

   Let's choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible? And put E in a non-fifth position.

   Example: ""SPIEL"" -> 
        letters: S, P, I, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.
        E is in the fifth? Wait: 
            P-O-S-I-T-I-O-N: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E? Wait, it's S-P-I-E-L -> so E is fourth? 
            So E in fourth position? 
        Then fifth is L? 
        That's fine.

   Or ""TOWED"": T,O,W,E,D -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fourth? 

   Or ""MOVIE"": M,O,V,I,E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fifth? We avoid? 

   So ""SPIEL"" sounds good: 
        S, P, I, E, L -> no duplicates? 

   We'll use that? 

   But note: we must be cautious: E is in fourth position? 

   What if the secret word has E in the first position? Then we would get S,P,I -> all absent? 
   And E as '-', L absent? That might not be informative? 

   Alternatively, we can use a word that starts with E? 

   Let me look for a better word? 

   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E at the end? We avoid? 

   ""STOLE"": E at the end? We avoid? 

   But we can try ""STEEL""? But not 5 distinct letters? 

   How about ""KELP""? Not 5 letters? 

   I think ""QUEST"": Q,U,E,S,T -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in third? 
        But Q is uncommon? 

   Let me go with ""SPIEL"". 

   So we guess ""SPIEL""? 

   But note: we might get more information.

   Alternatively, we can try ""E"", in the first position? 

   Let me decide: 

   Option 1: ""ELTCH"" (not a word) -> no.

   Option 2: ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth? Avoid C,R,A,N? Yes. Letters: E,D,G,E,S -> duplicates E? 
        If we guess it, the duplicate E might be confusing? 
        But the feedback will show: 
            First E: ✓ or -? 
            Fourth E? If the word has only one E and in the first? Then we get E(✓) and then E(x) for fourth? 
            Or if it also has E elsewhere? 

   But we don't know? 

   How about ""STOLE""? Even though E is at the end? We know the fifth letter is not E. 
        But if we put E at the end again, then the feedback for E will be '-', meaning E is present but not at fifth? 
        But we already know that? And we might learn about the other positions? 

        Actually, we haven't tested the fifth letter? We only know it's not E? So we can test other letters? 

        So ""STOLE"" has E at fifth? And we know it's not E? So we expect a '-' for E? 
        But we will learn about S,T,O,L: 
            If any of them are in the word? 

        However, we are testing S,T,O,L? 

        Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" tests S,P,I,E,L? 

        Either is fine? 

   Considering that E is already known to be present? Maybe we can avoid including E? 

   Actually, we have 5 guesses left? And we don't lose much? 

   However, we want to cover common letters? 

   Common letters: S, T, L, O, I are common? 

   So ""STOLE"" tests S,T,O,L,E? 
   But E at fifth: we expect a '-'? 
   Then we would get: 
        S at position 1 -> (✓ or - or x)
        T at 2 -> similarly
        O at 3 -> similarly
        L at 4 -> similarly
        E at 5 -> will be '-' (as expected)

   Since we know E is present? Then regardless of other letters? 

   But we are testing 5 letters? With E being known? 

   Alternatively, I found a word: ""STILE"" (a type of ladder)? S,T,I,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        Also, E is at fifth? And we avoid fifth? 

   But note: we haven't tried words with E not at fifth? 

   Given that we already know E is present and not at fifth, we might try to find E's position by putting it in an early position? 

   Let me choose a word that starts with E? 

   Example: ""ELAND""? Has A? A is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""EDGED""? Doubled E and D? 

   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.
        E in first? 
        This tests E,I,G,H,T? 

   Also, ""INLET"": I,N,L,E,T -> has N? Eliminated? 

   ""EASEL""? has A and E doubled? 

   ""EVITE"": E,V,I,T,E -> avoid? 

   ""ETUDE"": E,T,U,D,E -> avoid duplicates? 

   ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

        So ""EXIST"": E(1), X(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). 
        But T is at fifth? We don't know about T? 

   But note, we don't want to use fifth for E? But fifth here is T? 

   So ""EXIST"" has E at first? 

   I think ""EXIST"" or ""EIGHT""?

   Commonality: S is more common than G and H? 

   So ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> it tests E at first? 

   We might get E(✓) if E is at first? 

   Otherwise, E(-) if E is elsewhere? 

   So let me choose a word like ""EXIST"".

   We have to decide.

   Given the above, I will choose ""EXIST"". 

   So our second guess: ""EXIST""

   But let me see: 
        We avoid C,R,A,N? Yes: E,X,I,S,T doesn't have any of C,R,A,N.

   So guess ""EXIST"".

   Alternatively, if we want to avoid X? because X is rare? 

   Then ""MIDST"" -> M,I,D,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        But doesn't include E? Then we don't test E? 
        But we know E is present? So by not including E, we might get no feedback for E? 
        And then we don't learn about the position? 
        However, we will learn about these letters? 

        But if the word has E, and E is in ""MIDST"", we would not learn its position? 

        Actually, the feedback will still be: 
            If M is not in word -> x
            I -> if in word and in position: ✓ or -? 
            D -> same
            S -> same
            T -> same

        And if E is in the word? It doesn't come up? 

        So we don't get info on E? 

        That's bad because we know E is present? 

        We should include E? 

   Therefore, we must include E? 

   So I go with ""EXIST"" or ""SPIEL""? 

   After consideration, let me choose ""SPIEL"": 
        Reason: It includes E (but not fifth? fourth instead) and avoids C,R,A,N? 
        Also, letters S,P,I,E,L -> common letters? 

   We'll guess ""SPIEL"".

   But note: position of E? In ""SPIEL"" the positions are: 
        1: S
        2: P
        3: I
        4: E
        5: L

   So we are testing E in fourth? 

   If the secret word has E in fourth? We get ✓ for E? 
   Otherwise, if it has E elsewhere? Then '-' for E? 

   But let's hope we get some other hits? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word with E in the first? 

   Since we don't know? But time is short? 

   Another common word: ""POUND"" -> skip because we don't have E? 

   We must include E? 

   So ""QUEUE"" is not helpful? 

   Final: Guess ""SPIEL""

   Or ""E"", first: ""ENTRY"" -> has N? and R? -> invalid.

   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        And E in first? 

   I think ""EIGHT"" is a good word? 

   So I'll choose ""EIGHT""

   Why? It tests E at position 1? And I,G,H,T? 

   We haven't tested G,H,T,I? 

   Common letters: I, T, H are common? 

   Let's do ""EIGHT""

   So guess: ""EIGHT""

   Second guess: ""eight""

   But note: E is at first? 

   We expect if E is first, ✓. If not, then '-' because we know E is present? 

   But what if the secret word has no E at the first? Then we get '-' and we know E is in the word? 

   So this is acceptable.

   We proceed with ""EIGHT"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked as ""-"").

This means:
- The secret word contains the letter E, located in positions 1–4.
- The letters C, R, A, and N must be excluded from all subsequent guesses.

For the next guess:
- We need to include E in a different position (anywhere except the 5th) to help identify its correct location.
- Letters like T, I, G, and H are strong choices because they are common in English words and haven't been tested yet.
- ""EIGHT"" aligns with these criteria: 
  - E is placed in position 1 (testing if E appears there).
  - T, I, G, and H are new letters that maximize information gain.
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

This guess will help narrow down the position of E and test four additional common letters efficiently.

<guess>eight</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
  C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.
  E is present but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
Meaning:
  E is present but not in the 1st position (since we guessed it in the first position and got '-'). 
  I is present and in the correct position (2nd position, because in ""eight"", I is the second letter).
  G, H, T are absent.

So from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T
Present letters: E (but not in 1st or 5th position) and I (which is in the 2nd position).

Therefore, the secret word has:
  - The second letter is I.
  - The letter E is present, but not in the 1st, 2nd (because second is I), or 5th position. So E must be in the 3rd or 4th position.

We also know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

We have 4 tries left.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
  - Has 5 letters, all from the remaining possible letters (excluding absent ones).
  - Must have I in the second position.
  - Must include E in either the 3rd or 4th position (to check which one).
  - Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

Available letters: 
  We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, G, H, T (from the two guesses). 
  But note: E and I are present, so they are still in play (but we know I is fixed at position 2).

  The alphabet without the absent letters: 
    B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

  And we know E must be included (but not in 1st, 2nd, or 5th) and I is fixed at position 2.

So the secret word pattern is: 
  Position 1: one of B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but not E, because E is not in 1st)
  Position 2: I (fixed)
  Position 3: either E or one of the available letters? But note: E must be in the word, and it can only be in 3rd or 4th. So either position 3 or 4 must be E.
  Position 4: similarly, if E is not in 3rd, then it must be in 4th.
  Position 5: one of the available letters (but not E, because E is not in 5th).

We can try to form a word that has I in the second position and E in the third position? Or in the fourth?

We should also try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Option 1: Assume E is in the 3rd position -> pattern: _ I E _ _
Option 2: Assume E is in the 4th position -> pattern: _ I _ E _

We don't know which, so we can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in the 3rd position and then if it's not there, we know it must be in the 4th? 

But we can also choose a word that doesn't have E at all? But we must include E because we know it's present? 

Wait, we must include E? Actually, we don't have to? But if we don't include E, then we won't get information about E's position? 

But we know E is present? So if we don't include E, we will get all the other letters' feedback, but we won't learn about E? 

However, we can still get the feedback for the letters we do include? 

But we have limited guesses? So it's better to include E to try to locate it? 

So let's include E in either the 3rd or 4th position? 

We can choose a word that has E in the 3rd position? 

For example: 
  Pattern: _ I E _ _

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with available letters.

Available letters: B,D,F,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: S, L, O, P, D, etc.

Example words: 
  ""SIEVE"" -> S I E V E -> but E is in 3rd and 5th? But we cannot have E in 5th? 
      Also, V is present? 
      But note: we are going to put E in 3rd? and 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? So we cannot use E in 5th? 
      So ""SIEVE"" is invalid because it has E in 5th? 

  ""SIEVE"" is not allowed? Because we know E is not in 5th? So we must avoid E in 5th? 

  ""DIET_"" -> but we need 5 letters? ""DIETS"" -> D I E T S -> but T is absent? T is eliminated? 

  ""LIEU_"" -> ""LIEUS"" (a word? meaning a unit of the French currency) -> L I E U S -> avoids absent letters? 
        Letters: L, I, E, U, S -> all allowed? 
        But E is in 3rd? 
        And no E in 5th? 

  ""BIELD"" (Scottish word for shelter) -> B I E L D -> avoids absent letters? 
        B, I, E, L, D -> all allowed? 

  ""PIECE"" -> P I E C E -> but C is absent? 

  ""FIELD"" -> F I E L D -> avoids absent letters? 
        F, I, E, L, D -> all allowed? 

  ""WIELD"" -> W I E L D -> same.

  ""PIEZO"" -> P I E Z O -> avoids absent? 

But note: we are not sure if these words are in the word list? 

Alternatively, we can try E in the 4th position? 

Pattern: _ I _ E _

Example: 
  ""SIRED"" -> S I R E D -> but R is absent? 
  ""FILED"" -> F I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        F, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 

  ""MILER"" -> M I L E R -> R absent? 
  ""BIDES"" -> B I D E S -> avoids absent? 

  ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S -> avoids absent? 

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

We can choose either pattern? 

But we want to maximize information? 

We know that E is either in 3rd or 4th? So if we choose a word with E in 3rd, we can test that hypothesis? 

If we get E(✓) in 3rd, then we know E is in 3rd? 
If we get E(-) in 3rd, then E is not in 3rd? So it must be in 4th? 

Similarly, if we put E in 4th? 

So either way, we can get the position? 

But we also want to test other letters? 

So let's choose a word that has E in 3rd and has common letters? 

I'll go with ""FIELD"": F I E L D -> 
  F: new letter
  I: already known to be in second? so we expect ✓ for I? 
  E: in 3rd? we test if E is in 3rd? 
  L: new letter? 
  D: new letter? 

But note: we are using F, L, D? 

Alternatively, ""WIELD"": W I E L D -> same? 

But ""FIELD"" is more common? 

However, we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't know? 

But we haven't seen any repeated letters so far? 

Another idea: we can choose a word that has E in 3rd and also includes other common letters? 

But we have limited letters? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in 4th? 

But let's stick with E in 3rd? 

I choose ""FIELD"". 

But wait: what if the secret word is ""FIELD""? Then we win? 

But we don't know? 

But let's see: 
  If we guess ""FIELD"", and the secret word has E in 3rd? Then we get:
      F: ? 
      I: ✓ (because second is I)
      E: ✓ (if E is in 3rd) 
      L: ? 
      D: ?

  If the secret word is ""FIELD"", then we get all ✓? 

  But if not, we get feedback on F, L, D? 

  Also, if E is not in 3rd, then we get E(-) meaning E is present but not in 3rd? Then we know E must be in 4th? 

So it's a good test? 

But note: we are using F, L, D? 

We could use more common letters? 

Common letters: S, O, L, D, etc. 

How about ""SILED""? Not a common word? 

""OILED"": O I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        O, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 
        But E is in 4th? 

But we are testing E in 4th? 

We can do that? 

But we don't know if E is in 3rd or 4th? 

So if we choose ""OILED"", we are testing E in 4th? 

If we get E(✓) in 4th, then we know E is in 4th? 
If we get E(-) in 4th, then E is not in 4th? So it must be in 3rd? 

So both ""FIELD"" (E in 3rd) and ""OILED"" (E in 4th) are valid? 

But we can only choose one? 

I think we should choose one that uses more common letters? 

""OILED"" has O, L, D? 

""FIELD"" has F, L, D? 

O is more common than F? 

But we don't know? 

Another word: ""SIDLE"": S I D L E -> but E is in 5th? Not allowed? 

""QUIET"": Q U I E T -> T is absent? 

""JUICY"": J U I C Y -> C absent? 

""PILED"": P I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        P, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 
        E in 4th? 

""PILED"" is a word? 

Similarly, ""WIPED"": W I P E D -> avoids absent? 

But we have to avoid T? 

I think ""PILED"" is a good choice? 

But let me compare:

  ""FIELD"": tests E in 3rd, and letters F, L, D? 
  ""PILED"": tests E in 4th, and letters P, L, D? 

We already know I is in second? 

In ""PILED"", the I is in second? So we expect I(✓). 

We can choose either? 

But note: we haven't tested S? S is a very common letter? 

So maybe we should include S? 

Pattern for E in 3rd: _ I E _ _ 
  With S: 
      Position 1: S -> ""SIE??"" 
      We need two more letters? 
      Example: ""SIEVE"" -> invalid because of E at the end? 
      ""SIEGE"" -> S I E G E -> but G is absent? 
      ""SIECE"" -> not a word? 
      ""SIELD"" -> not a word? 
      ""SIEUR"" -> S I E U R -> R is absent? 

Pattern for E in 4th: _ I _ E _ 
  With S: 
      ""S I ? E ?"" 
      Example: ""SIRED"" -> R absent? 
      ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S -> avoids absent? 
          D is allowed? 
          But note: S is used twice? 
          Also, E is in 4th? 
          And fifth is S? 
          So ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S? 
          But we don't know if the word allows duplicates? 

      ""SINES"" -> S I N E S -> N is absent? 
      ""SILES"" -> not a word? 
      ""SITES"" -> T is absent? 
      ""SIVES"" -> not common? 

  ""SIXES"" -> S I X E S -> avoids absent? 
        But X is allowed? 
        And S is duplicated? 

  ""SIZES"" -> S I Z E S -> avoids absent? 

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

The rules don't say? But in Wordle, duplicates are allowed? 

But in our feedback, we haven't seen any duplicates? 

But the secret word might have duplicates? 

However, to be safe, we can avoid duplicates? 

So ""SIDES"" is a word? And it has two S's? 

But we are testing S in first and fifth? 

If the secret word has only one S? Then we might get S(✓) and S(x) for the fifth? 

But it's acceptable? 

But we are not sure? 

Alternatively, without duplicates: 

  ""SIXES"" has two S's? 

  ""SIXTH"" -> T and H absent? 

  ""SIXTY"" -> T absent? 

  ""SILED"" -> S I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        S, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 
        E in 4th? 

  ""SILED"" is a word? (past tense of sile: to descend, as a hawk) 

  But not common? 

  ""SIPED"" -> not a word? 

  ""SIMES"" -> not a word? 

  ""SIBYL"" -> S I B Y L -> avoids absent? 
        But no E? We must include E? 

  We must include E? 

  So ""SILED"" is acceptable? 

  But we are testing E in 4th? 

  Similarly, we can do ""SIDED"" -> but D repeated? 

  ""SIDED"" has two D's? 

  ""SIDLE"" -> S I D L E -> E in fifth? Not allowed? 

So I think ""SILED"" is acceptable? 

But to use common words, I'll avoid ""SILED"". 

Another common word: ""DOILY"" -> no E? 

We must include E? 

So I think ""PILED"" is a common word? 

I'll go with ""PILED"": 
  P I L E D 
  This tests:
      P in first? 
      I in second: ✓ (we know)
      L in third? 
      E in fourth? 
      D in fifth? 

  If E is in fourth, we get E(✓) and then we know the position? 
  If E is not in fourth, we get E(-) meaning E is present but not in fourth? Then we know E must be in third? 

  Also, we test P, L, D? 

  So we get information on three new letters? 

  And we avoid the absent letters? 

  So I choose ""PILED"". 

But note: we are testing E in the fourth position? 

Alternatively, we can test E in the third? 

But we have to choose one? 

I think it's symmetric? 

So I'll go with ""PILED"". 

Guess: ""PILED""

But let me confirm: 
  We have not used P, L, D before? 
  And we avoid C,R,A,N,G,H,T? 

Yes.

So <guess>piled</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A, N are absent (x), E is present but not in the 5th position (-).
- **Guess 2: ""eight""** → E is present but not in the 1st position (-), I is correct and in the 2nd position (✓), and G, H, T are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
1. **I is fixed in the 2nd position** of the secret word.
2. **E is present** but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since position 2 is I, and E was misplaced in positions 1 and 5). Thus, E must be in **position 3 or 4**.
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T (cannot be used).
4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **E in the 4th position** to narrow down its location (if E is not in the 4th, it must be in the 3rd).
- Include **new common letters** (P, L, D) to maximize information.
- Use a valid word that fits the pattern `_ I _ E _` and avoids absent letters.

The word **""PILED""** is chosen because:
- It places I in the 2nd position (✓, as required).
- It tests E in the 4th position (if E is here, it will be ✓; if not, E must be in the 3rd).
- It introduces three new common letters (P, L, D) to check for presence/position.
- It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, N, G, H, T).

But we are not allowed to put E at the end? \n   Actually, we can put E at the end again? Let me clarify: The feedback says E is present but not in the fifth position. \n   That is, in this particular word, E was in the fifth position and it was wrong. \n   But E might appear more than once? The feedback does not indicate multiple E\'s. \n   However, the secret word might have only one E? \n\n So when we guess, we can try E in a different position. Avoiding fifth.\n\n Let me avoid E in the fifth position.\n\n Some words without E at the end:\n\n   First position: ""EAGLE"" -> but A is already eliminated? We know A is not in the word, so ""EAGLE"" has A which is bad.\n\n   Second position: like ""LEMON"" -> but L,E,M,O,N? Wait, N is eliminated! So we cannot use N.\n\n   Third position: ""PLUME"" -> E at the end? Not good.\n\n   Fourth position: ""SMILE"" -> E at the end? Not good.\n\n We need E not in the fifth. So positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n Let me think of words with E in the first position that do not contain C,R,A,N.\n\n Examples: \n   ""EAGLE"" has A -> invalid because A is absent.\n   ""EERIE"" has multiple E\'s? And avoids A,C,N,R? But it has R? Wait, R is absent so we cannot use R? \n   Actually, R is absent so we cannot include R. ""EERIE"" has R? No: EERIE has letters E, E, R, I, E? \n   Actually: E E R I E? That has R? So avoid.\n\n   ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth positions? And avoids A,C,R,N? Letters: E, D, G, E, S -> no C,R,A,N.\n\n   But we don\'t know if the word has multiple E\'s? We only know there is at least one E. \n   However, we are trying to maximize new information.\n\n   Another word: ""EBONY"" -> has N? No, we know N is absent. So avoid N.\n\n   ""ELOPE"": Letters: E, L, O, P, E -> avoids C,R,A,N? And E in first and fifth? But we know E is not in fifth? \n   We are not sure about fifth? Actually, our feedback said E is present but not in fifth? \n   So the secret word has at least one E that is not in the fifth position. \n   It could have another E in the fifth? But we don\'t know.\n\n   However, we want to avoid the fifth position for E because we know that the fifth letter is not E? \n   Actually, the feedback tells us that the fifth letter was not E in the secret word? \n   Our guess ""crane"" had E at the fifth, and it was marked as \'-\' meaning E is in the word but not at that spot. \n   So the fifth letter of the secret word is not E. Therefore, we should avoid putting E in the fifth again? \n   But we can put it again? It doesn\'t matter because we are trying to learn more.\n\n   However, we already know E is not in fifth? So we should try E in a different position.\n\n   Let\'s choose a word with E not in fifth and without C,R,A,N.\n\n   Words with E in position 1: \n      ELBOW -> letters: E, L, B, O, W -> avoids A,C,R,N?\n      ELITE -> E, L, I, T, E -> but we use E twice? And avoids C,R,A,N? \n          However, note: we don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s? So it\'s okay.\n\n   But let\'s look for words with more common letters.\n\n   Another common letter is T, so I might want to include T.\n\n   Word with E in second position? \n      ""TEETH"" -> E in second and fourth? But T is used twice? \n      But avoids A,C,R,N? \n          Also, we don\'t know about T? \n\n   We haven\'t tested T yet? So we can use T.\n\n   Common starting words with E and avoiding C,R,A,N: \n      ""SLATE"" -> S,L,A,T,E? But A is eliminated -> invalid.\n      ""ROAST"" -> has R and A -> invalid.\n\n   How about ""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? But E is at the fourth position? And the fifth letter is L? \n\n   But note: we need words without A, R, N, C.\n\n   Another: ""BOWEL"": B,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? \n\n   But we also want to test more new letters.\n\n   Let\'s list available letters: we haven\'t used many.\n\n   We know E is present. We have used C,R,A,N,E (from first guess). \n\n   So available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\n   We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter in the secret word.\n\n   Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, S, T, L, O, I, ... but we already know E is there.\n\n   So include S, T, L, O.\n\n   How about a word that has E and S, T, L, O? Without using C,R,A,N.\n\n   Example: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        But note: ""STOLE"" has E at the end? We don\'t want to put E at the end? \n        Because we know the fifth letter is not E? \n        But we can use it to test other positions? \n\n        We are forced to put E somewhere? The feedback does not forbid E at the end? \n        We just know that it\'s not in the fifth position? So putting E at the end again would not help? \n        Because we already know E is present and not at the fifth? \n\n        However, the secret word might have E at more than one position? \n        We don\'t know. So by putting E at the end again, if the secret word has two E\'s? \n        Then we would get \'-\' for E again? \n\n        Alternatively, we might learn about other letters.\n\n   Since we have E present, we can try to place it in a different position to see where it goes.\n\n   Why not put E at the beginning? \n\n   Let me choose ""ELOPS"": but I\'m not sure if it\'s a valid word? \n\n   Alternatively, ""STOLE"" is valid? But E at the end is redundant? \n\n   Another word: ""HOMES"" -> H,O,M,E,S -> E is fourth? \n   Also, avoids A,C,R,N? \n\n   Or ""TIMES"": T,I,M,E,S -> E in fourth? \n\n   Or ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> E in fifth? We avoid fifth? \n\n   Let\'s avoid E in fifth? \n\n   How about ""TILES"": T,I,L,E,S -> E in fourth? \n   But that\'s one letter? \n\n   Another idea: ""FLUID"", but no E? We must include E? Or we don\'t have to? \n   Actually, we don\'t have to include E? But note: the feedback only tells us that E is in the word? \n   But we have not confirmed where? So including E in a different position might help locate it.\n\n   However, if we don\'t include E, we might not get information about E? But we already know E is present? \n   So we can choose words without E? That might help test other letters? \n\n   The rules say we can guess any valid word? But strategically, we want to find the word quickly.\n\n   Since we know E is present, and we don\'t know its position, we should try E in a different position? \n\n   So I think we should put E in one of positions 1 to 4.\n\n   Let me choose a word with E in the first position: \n      ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. \n      This way, if E is in the first position, we get a ✓ for E? Otherwise, if E is not in first, but in the word, we get a \'-\'? \n\n   Alternatively, we can put E in a more common position? \n\n   Common positions for E: not at the end? Then in the middle? \n\n   According to feedback, E was at fifth and that was wrong? So E must be in 1,2,3,4.\n\n   We can also try E in the second position? \n\n   Let me pick a word with E in the second position and common letters: \n      ""BELLY"": B,E,L,L,Y -> but double L? \n      ""TEETH"": double E? \n      ""BESTI"": no.\n\n   How about ""METAL""? But A is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   ""LEMON"": but L,E,M,O,N? We have N? N is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   ""PETOS"": not a word? \n\n   Let me think: without A and N, and with E in second? \n      ""HELIO"" is not 5 letters? \n      ""DEUCE"" but D,E,U,C,E? C is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   Words with E in the third position: \n      ""CRUES"" -> C is eliminated -> invalid?\n      ""SPIEL"": S,P,I,E,L -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        E is fourth? Wait: S P I E L -> third letter I, fourth E? \n        We want E in third? \n\n   Actually: \n      ""GRUEL"" -> G,R,U,E,L? R is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   ""SUEDE"": S,U,E,D,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. But E in third and fifth? \n        Fifth: we know E is not fifth? So we get \'-\' for third position? Or if the word has only one E? \n\n   This is getting messy.\n\n   Since we have eliminated only 4 letters (C,R,A,N) and have 22 left? \n\n   Let\'s choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible? And put E in a non-fifth position.\n\n   Example: ""SPIEL"" -> \n        letters: S, P, I, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n        E is in the fifth? Wait: \n            P-O-S-I-T-I-O-N: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E? Wait, it\'s S-P-I-E-L -> so E is fourth? \n            So E in fourth position? \n        Then fifth is L? \n        That\'s fine.\n\n   Or ""TOWED"": T,O,W,E,D -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fourth? \n\n   Or ""MOVIE"": M,O,V,I,E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fifth? We avoid? \n\n   So ""SPIEL"" sounds good: \n        S, P, I, E, L -> no duplicates? \n\n   We\'ll use that? \n\n   But note: we must be cautious: E is in fourth position? \n\n   What if the secret word has E in the first position? Then we would get S,P,I -> all absent? \n   And E as \'-\', L absent? That might not be informative? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a word that starts with E? \n\n   Let me look for a better word? \n\n   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E at the end? We avoid? \n\n   ""STOLE"": E at the end? We avoid? \n\n   But we can try ""STEEL""? But not 5 distinct letters? \n\n   How about ""KELP""? Not 5 letters? \n\n   I think ""QUEST"": Q,U,E,S,T -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in third? \n        But Q is uncommon? \n\n   Let me go with ""SPIEL"". \n\n   So we guess ""SPIEL""? \n\n   But note: we might get more information.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""E"", in the first position? \n\n   Let me decide: \n\n   Option 1: ""ELTCH"" (not a word) -> no.\n\n   Option 2: ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth? Avoid C,R,A,N? Yes. Letters: E,D,G,E,S -> duplicates E? \n        If we guess it, the duplicate E might be confusing? \n        But the feedback will show: \n            First E: ✓ or -? \n            Fourth E? If the word has only one E and in the first? Then we get E(✓) and then E(x) for fourth? \n            Or if it also has E elsewhere? \n\n   But we don\'t know? \n\n   How about ""STOLE""? Even though E is at the end? We know the fifth letter is not E. \n        But if we put E at the end again, then the feedback for E will be \'-\', meaning E is present but not at fifth? \n        But we already know that? And we might learn about the other positions? \n\n        Actually, we haven\'t tested the fifth letter? We only know it\'s not E? So we can test other letters? \n\n        So ""STOLE"" has E at fifth? And we know it\'s not E? So we expect a \'-\' for E? \n        But we will learn about S,T,O,L: \n            If any of them are in the word? \n\n        However, we are testing S,T,O,L? \n\n        Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" tests S,P,I,E,L? \n\n        Either is fine? \n\n   Considering that E is already known to be present? Maybe we can avoid including E? \n\n   Actually, we have 5 guesses left? And we don\'t lose much? \n\n   However, we want to cover common letters? \n\n   Common letters: S, T, L, O, I are common? \n\n   So ""STOLE"" tests S,T,O,L,E? \n   But E at fifth: we expect a \'-\'? \n   Then we would get: \n        S at position 1 -> (✓ or - or x)\n        T at 2 -> similarly\n        O at 3 -> similarly\n        L at 4 -> similarly\n        E at 5 -> will be \'-\' (as expected)\n\n   Since we know E is present? Then regardless of other letters? \n\n   But we are testing 5 letters? With E being known? \n\n   Alternatively, I found a word: ""STILE"" (a type of ladder)? S,T,I,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        Also, E is at fifth? And we avoid fifth? \n\n   But note: we haven\'t tried words with E not at fifth? \n\n   Given that we already know E is present and not at fifth, we might try to find E\'s position by putting it in an early position? \n\n   Let me choose a word that starts with E? \n\n   Example: ""ELAND""? Has A? A is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   ""EDGED""? Doubled E and D? \n\n   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n        E in first? \n        This tests E,I,G,H,T? \n\n   Also, ""INLET"": I,N,L,E,T -> has N? Eliminated? \n\n   ""EASEL""? has A and E doubled? \n\n   ""EVITE"": E,V,I,T,E -> avoid? \n\n   ""ETUDE"": E,T,U,D,E -> avoid duplicates? \n\n   ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\n        So ""EXIST"": E(1), X(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). \n        But T is at fifth? We don\'t know about T? \n\n   But note, we don\'t want to use fifth for E? But fifth here is T? \n\n   So ""EXIST"" has E at first? \n\n   I think ""EXIST"" or ""EIGHT""?\n\n   Commonality: S is more common than G and H? \n\n   So ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> it tests E at first? \n\n   We might get E(✓) if E is at first? \n\n   Otherwise, E(-) if E is elsewhere? \n\n   So let me choose a word like ""EXIST"".\n\n   We have to decide.\n\n   Given the above, I will choose ""EXIST"". \n\n   So our second guess: ""EXIST""\n\n   But let me see: \n        We avoid C,R,A,N? Yes: E,X,I,S,T doesn\'t have any of C,R,A,N.\n\n   So guess ""EXIST"".\n\n   Alternatively, if we want to avoid X? because X is rare? \n\n   Then ""MIDST"" -> M,I,D,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        But doesn\'t include E? Then we don\'t test E? \n        But we know E is present? So by not including E, we might get no feedback for E? \n        And then we don\'t learn about the position? \n        However, we will learn about these letters? \n\n        But if the word has E, and E is in ""MIDST"", we would not learn its position? \n\n        Actually, the feedback will still be: \n            If M is not in word -> x\n            I -> if in word and in position: ✓ or -? \n            D -> same\n            S -> same\n            T -> same\n\n        And if E is in the word? It doesn\'t come up? \n\n        So we don\'t get info on E? \n\n        That\'s bad because we know E is present? \n\n        We should include E? \n\n   Therefore, we must include E? \n\n   So I go with ""EXIST"" or ""SPIEL""? \n\n   After consideration, let me choose ""SPIEL"": \n        Reason: It includes E (but not fifth? fourth instead) and avoids C,R,A,N? \n        Also, letters S,P,I,E,L -> common letters? \n\n   We\'ll guess ""SPIEL"".\n\n   But note: position of E? In ""SPIEL"" the positions are: \n        1: S\n        2: P\n        3: I\n        4: E\n        5: L\n\n   So we are testing E in fourth? \n\n   If the secret word has E in fourth? We get ✓ for E? \n   Otherwise, if it has E elsewhere? Then \'-\' for E? \n\n   But let\'s hope we get some other hits? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word with E in the first? \n\n   Since we don\'t know? But time is short? \n\n   Another common word: ""POUND"" -> skip because we don\'t have E? \n\n   We must include E? \n\n   So ""QUEUE"" is not helpful? \n\n   Final: Guess ""SPIEL""\n\n   Or ""E"", first: ""ENTRY"" -> has N? and R? -> invalid.\n\n   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        And E in first? \n\n   I think ""EIGHT"" is a good word? \n\n   So I\'ll choose ""EIGHT""\n\n   Why? It tests E at position 1? And I,G,H,T? \n\n   We haven\'t tested G,H,T,I? \n\n   Common letters: I, T, H are common? \n\n   Let\'s do ""EIGHT""\n\n   So guess: ""EIGHT""\n\n   Second guess: ""eight""\n\n   But note: E is at first? \n\n   We expect if E is first, ✓. If not, then \'-\' because we know E is present? \n\n   But what if the secret word has no E at the first? Then we get \'-\' and we know E is in the word? \n\n   So this is acceptable.\n\n   We proceed with ""EIGHT"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked as ""x"").\n- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked as ""-"").\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word contains the letter E, located in positions 1–4.\n- The letters C, R, A, and N must be excluded from all subsequent guesses.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- We need to include E in a different position (anywhere except the 5th) to help identify its correct location.\n- Letters like T, I, G, and H are strong choices because they are common in English words and haven\'t been tested yet.\n- ""EIGHT"" aligns with these criteria: \n  - E is placed in position 1 (testing if E appears there).\n  - T, I, G, and H are new letters that maximize information gain.\n  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of E and test four additional common letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>eight</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning:\n  C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.\n  E is present but not in the 5th position.\n\nGuess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)\nMeaning:\n  E is present but not in the 1st position (since we guessed it in the first position and got \'-\'). \n  I is present and in the correct position (2nd position, because in ""eight"", I is the second letter).\n  G, H, T are absent.\n\nSo from both guesses, we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T\nPresent letters: E (but not in 1st or 5th position) and I (which is in the 2nd position).\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n  - The second letter is I.\n  - The letter E is present, but not in the 1st, 2nd (because second is I), or 5th position. So E must be in the 3rd or 4th position.\n\nWe also know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.\n\nWe have 4 tries left.\n\nNow, we need to form a new guess that:\n  - Has 5 letters, all from the remaining possible letters (excluding absent ones).\n  - Must have I in the second position.\n  - Must include E in either the 3rd or 4th position (to check which one).\n  - Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.\n\nAvailable letters: \n  We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, G, H, T (from the two guesses). \n  But note: E and I are present, so they are still in play (but we know I is fixed at position 2).\n\n  The alphabet without the absent letters: \n    B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\n  And we know E must be included (but not in 1st, 2nd, or 5th) and I is fixed at position 2.\n\nSo the secret word pattern is: \n  Position 1: one of B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but not E, because E is not in 1st)\n  Position 2: I (fixed)\n  Position 3: either E or one of the available letters? But note: E must be in the word, and it can only be in 3rd or 4th. So either position 3 or 4 must be E.\n  Position 4: similarly, if E is not in 3rd, then it must be in 4th.\n  Position 5: one of the available letters (but not E, because E is not in 5th).\n\nWe can try to form a word that has I in the second position and E in the third position? Or in the fourth?\n\nWe should also try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s consider the possibilities:\n\nOption 1: Assume E is in the 3rd position -> pattern: _ I E _ _\nOption 2: Assume E is in the 4th position -> pattern: _ I _ E _\n\nWe don\'t know which, so we can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has E in the 3rd position and then if it\'s not there, we know it must be in the 4th? \n\nBut we can also choose a word that doesn\'t have E at all? But we must include E because we know it\'s present? \n\nWait, we must include E? Actually, we don\'t have to? But if we don\'t include E, then we won\'t get information about E\'s position? \n\nBut we know E is present? So if we don\'t include E, we will get all the other letters\' feedback, but we won\'t learn about E? \n\nHowever, we can still get the feedback for the letters we do include? \n\nBut we have limited guesses? So it\'s better to include E to try to locate it? \n\nSo let\'s include E in either the 3rd or 4th position? \n\nWe can choose a word that has E in the 3rd position? \n\nFor example: \n  Pattern: _ I E _ _\n\nWe need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with available letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B,D,F,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nWe want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nCommon letters: S, L, O, P, D, etc.\n\nExample words: \n  ""SIEVE"" -> S I E V E -> but E is in 3rd and 5th? But we cannot have E in 5th? \n      Also, V is present? \n      But note: we are going to put E in 3rd? and 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? So we cannot use E in 5th? \n      So ""SIEVE"" is invalid because it has E in 5th? \n\n  ""SIEVE"" is not allowed? Because we know E is not in 5th? So we must avoid E in 5th? \n\n  ""DIET_"" -> but we need 5 letters? ""DIETS"" -> D I E T S -> but T is absent? T is eliminated? \n\n  ""LIEU_"" -> ""LIEUS"" (a word? meaning a unit of the French currency) -> L I E U S -> avoids absent letters? \n        Letters: L, I, E, U, S -> all allowed? \n        But E is in 3rd? \n        And no E in 5th? \n\n  ""BIELD"" (Scottish word for shelter) -> B I E L D -> avoids absent letters? \n        B, I, E, L, D -> all allowed? \n\n  ""PIECE"" -> P I E C E -> but C is absent? \n\n  ""FIELD"" -> F I E L D -> avoids absent letters? \n        F, I, E, L, D -> all allowed? \n\n  ""WIELD"" -> W I E L D -> same.\n\n  ""PIEZO"" -> P I E Z O -> avoids absent? \n\nBut note: we are not sure if these words are in the word list? \n\nAlternatively, we can try E in the 4th position? \n\nPattern: _ I _ E _\n\nExample: \n  ""SIRED"" -> S I R E D -> but R is absent? \n  ""FILED"" -> F I L E D -> avoids absent? \n        F, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? \n\n  ""MILER"" -> M I L E R -> R absent? \n  ""BIDES"" -> B I D E S -> avoids absent? \n\n  ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S -> avoids absent? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nWe can choose either pattern? \n\nBut we want to maximize information? \n\nWe know that E is either in 3rd or 4th? So if we choose a word with E in 3rd, we can test that hypothesis? \n\nIf we get E(✓) in 3rd, then we know E is in 3rd? \nIf we get E(-) in 3rd, then E is not in 3rd? So it must be in 4th? \n\nSimilarly, if we put E in 4th? \n\nSo either way, we can get the position? \n\nBut we also want to test other letters? \n\nSo let\'s choose a word that has E in 3rd and has common letters? \n\nI\'ll go with ""FIELD"": F I E L D -> \n  F: new letter\n  I: already known to be in second? so we expect ✓ for I? \n  E: in 3rd? we test if E is in 3rd? \n  L: new letter? \n  D: new letter? \n\nBut note: we are using F, L, D? \n\nAlternatively, ""WIELD"": W I E L D -> same? \n\nBut ""FIELD"" is more common? \n\nHowever, we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut we haven\'t seen any repeated letters so far? \n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has E in 3rd and also includes other common letters? \n\nBut we have limited letters? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has E in 4th? \n\nBut let\'s stick with E in 3rd? \n\nI choose ""FIELD"". \n\nBut wait: what if the secret word is ""FIELD""? Then we win? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nBut let\'s see: \n  If we guess ""FIELD"", and the secret word has E in 3rd? Then we get:\n      F: ? \n      I: ✓ (because second is I)\n      E: ✓ (if E is in 3rd) \n      L: ? \n      D: ?\n\n  If the secret word is ""FIELD"", then we get all ✓? \n\n  But if not, we get feedback on F, L, D? \n\n  Also, if E is not in 3rd, then we get E(-) meaning E is present but not in 3rd? Then we know E must be in 4th? \n\nSo it\'s a good test? \n\nBut note: we are using F, L, D? \n\nWe could use more common letters? \n\nCommon letters: S, O, L, D, etc. \n\nHow about ""SILED""? Not a common word? \n\n""OILED"": O I L E D -> avoids absent? \n        O, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? \n        But E is in 4th? \n\nBut we are testing E in 4th? \n\nWe can do that? \n\nBut we don\'t know if E is in 3rd or 4th? \n\nSo if we choose ""OILED"", we are testing E in 4th? \n\nIf we get E(✓) in 4th, then we know E is in 4th? \nIf we get E(-) in 4th, then E is not in 4th? So it must be in 3rd? \n\nSo both ""FIELD"" (E in 3rd) and ""OILED"" (E in 4th) are valid? \n\nBut we can only choose one? \n\nI think we should choose one that uses more common letters? \n\n""OILED"" has O, L, D? \n\n""FIELD"" has F, L, D? \n\nO is more common than F? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nAnother word: ""SIDLE"": S I D L E -> but E is in 5th? Not allowed? \n\n""QUIET"": Q U I E T -> T is absent? \n\n""JUICY"": J U I C Y -> C absent? \n\n""PILED"": P I L E D -> avoids absent? \n        P, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? \n        E in 4th? \n\n""PILED"" is a word? \n\nSimilarly, ""WIPED"": W I P E D -> avoids absent? \n\nBut we have to avoid T? \n\nI think ""PILED"" is a good choice? \n\nBut let me compare:\n\n  ""FIELD"": tests E in 3rd, and letters F, L, D? \n  ""PILED"": tests E in 4th, and letters P, L, D? \n\nWe already know I is in second? \n\nIn ""PILED"", the I is in second? So we expect I(✓). \n\nWe can choose either? \n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested S? S is a very common letter? \n\nSo maybe we should include S? \n\nPattern for E in 3rd: _ I E _ _ \n  With S: \n      Position 1: S -> ""SIE??"" \n      We need two more letters? \n      Example: ""SIEVE"" -> invalid because of E at the end? \n      ""SIEGE"" -> S I E G E -> but G is absent? \n      ""SIECE"" -> not a word? \n      ""SIELD"" -> not a word? \n      ""SIEUR"" -> S I E U R -> R is absent? \n\nPattern for E in 4th: _ I _ E _ \n  With S: \n      ""S I ?

But in Wordle, duplicates are allowed? \n\nBut in our feedback, we haven\'t seen any duplicates? \n\nBut the secret word might have duplicates? \n\nHowever, to be safe, we can avoid duplicates? \n\nSo ""SIDES"" is a word? And it has two S\'s? \n\nBut we are testing S in first and fifth? \n\nIf the secret word has only one S? Then we might get S(✓) and S(x) for the fifth? \n\nBut it\'s acceptable? \n\nBut we are not sure? \n\nAlternatively, without duplicates: \n\n  ""SIXES"" has two S\'s? \n\n  ""SIXTH"" -> T and H absent? \n\n  ""SIXTY"" -> T absent? \n\n  ""SILED"" -> S I L E D -> avoids absent? \n        S, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? \n        E in 4th? \n\n  ""SILED"" is a word? (past tense of sile: to descend, as a hawk) \n\n  But not common? \n\n  ""SIPED"" -> not a word? \n\n  ""SIMES"" -> not a word? \n\n  ""SIBYL"" -> S I B Y L -> avoids absent? \n        But no E? We must include E? \n\n  We must include E? \n\n  So ""SILED"" is acceptable? \n\n  But we are testing E in 4th? \n\n  Similarly, we can do ""SIDED"" -> but D repeated? \n\n  ""SIDED"" has two D\'s? \n\n  ""SIDLE"" -> S I D L E -> E in fifth? Not allowed? \n\nSo I think ""SILED"" is acceptable? \n\nBut to use common words, I\'ll avoid ""SILED"". \n\nAnother common word: ""DOILY"" -> no E? \n\nWe must include E? \n\nSo I think ""PILED"" is a common word? \n\nI\'ll go with ""PILED"": \n  P I L E D \n  This tests:\n      P in first? \n      I in second: ✓ (we know)\n      L in third? \n      E in fourth? \n      D in fifth? \n\n  If E is in fourth, we get E(✓) and then we know the position? \n  If E is not in fourth, we get E(-) meaning E is present but not in fourth?

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent. E is present but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
  Meaning: E is present but not in the 1st position. I is present and in the correct position (2nd). G, H, T are absent.

Guess 3: ""piled"" -> P(x), I(✓), L(-), E(✓), D(x)
  Meaning: P is absent. I is correct in the 2nd position (again). L is present but not in the 3rd position. E is present and in the correct position (4th). D is absent.

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. Correctly positioned letters:
   - I is in the 2nd position.
   - E is in the 4th position.

   So the secret word has the form: _ I _ E _

2. Present letters but not in the guessed positions:
   - E was previously marked as present but not in 1st (from guess2) and not in 5th (from guess1). Now we know it is in 4th (from guess3).
   - L is present but not in the 3rd position (from guess3). Since the 4th position is E, L must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th? But wait, the word is _ I _ E _, so positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
        Position 2: I
        Position 4: E
        So L is present and not in 3rd, so it must be in position 1 or 5? But note: we have only 5 positions.

   However, we must consider that L could be in position 1 or 5? But we don't have a 5th position for L? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 5 are open? But we know position 3 was guessed as L in ""piled"" and it was marked as '-', meaning L is not in position 3. So L must be in position 1 or 5.

3. Absent letters:
   From all guesses: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D are absent.

   So absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D.

4. Present letters (including those correctly placed and misplaced):
   - E (in position 4)
   - I (in position 2)
   - L (present, but not in position 3, so must be in 1 or 5)

   Also, from guess1, we know E is present (and now we know it's in 4th). From guess2, I is present (in 2nd). From guess3, L is present (but not in 3rd).

   So the secret word contains at least: I, E, L.

   And we have two positions to fill: 1, 3, and 5? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 5 are unknown, but we know one of position 1 or 5 must be L? And the other two must be filled with letters that are not absent and not already known? 

   But note: the word has 5 letters. We have:
        Position 1: ? (could be L or a new letter)
        Position 2: I
        Position 3: ? 
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: ? 

   And we know L is present and not in 3, so it must be in 1 or 5.

   Therefore, the word has L in either position 1 or 5, and the remaining two positions (if L is in 1, then positions 3 and 5; if L is in 5, then positions 1 and 3) must be filled with letters that are not absent and not I or E (which are already placed).

   But note: the word might have more than one L? The feedback doesn't indicate that. In guess3, we had only one L (in position 3) and it was marked as '-', meaning that L is present but not there. It doesn't say anything about other L's? So it's possible that L appears again? But we don't know.

   However, to be safe, we should consider that L might be only once? Or it might be twice? 

   But since we have limited information, we can assume for now that L appears only once? 

   Actually, the feedback for ""piled"" had only one L and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if there were two L's, we might have gotten two marks? But in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will mark each occurrence appropriately? 

   For example, if the word has two L's and we guess one in the correct position and one in the wrong, we would get one ✓ and one -? But in this case, we only have one L in the guess and it was marked as '-', meaning that there is at least one L that is not in that position. It doesn't rule out the possibility of another L? 

   However, we don't have evidence of a second L? So we can proceed with the assumption that there is only one L? 

   Therefore, L must be in position 1 or 5.

5. Available letters: 
   We have used: C,R,A,N,E,I,G,H,T,P,L,D (from the three guesses). 
   Absent: C,R,A,N,G,H,T,P,D -> so these cannot be used.
   Present: E, I, L (and we know E and I are fixed, L is to be placed).

   The remaining letters (not absent and not yet placed) are: 
        B, F, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

   But note: we have to fill the positions 1, 3, 5, but one of them is L (if L is only once). 

   So the word must have L in either 1 or 5, and the other two positions from the available letters.

   Also, the letter in position 3 must be one of the available letters (and not L, because if L is only once and we place it in 1 or 5, then position 3 cannot be L).

Now, we need to form a guess that helps us determine:
   - Where L is (position 1 or 5)?
   - What are the letters in the remaining positions?

But note: we have two unknowns (if we consider L's position) and three positions? Actually, we have:

Case 1: L in position 1 -> then the word is: L I ? E ? 
   Then positions 3 and 5 must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set (B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) and not L.

Case 2: L in position 5 -> then the word is: ? I ? E L
   Then positions 1 and 3 must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set.

We can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position 1 and then we see? Or in position 5? 

But we don't know? 

We can also choose a word that doesn't include L? But we know L is present? So if we don't include L, we will get an 'x' for L? But we know L is present? So that would be a waste? 

Therefore, we must include L? 

But we don't know if L is in 1 or 5? 

So we have to choose one? 

We can choose a word that has L in position 1? Then if L is in 1, we get ✓ for L? If not, we get '-' meaning L is present but not in 1? Then we know L must be in 5? 

Similarly, if we put L in 5, then if we get ✓ for L, it's in 5? If we get '-', then L is in 1? 

So either way, we can determine L's position? 

But we also want to test the other letters? 

So let's choose a word that has L in position 1? 

Then the pattern: L I ? E ? 

We need to fill positions 3 and 5 with available letters? 

We want to use common letters? 

For example: 
   Position 3: S (common)
   Position 5: O (common) -> ""L I S E O"" -> not a word? 

   ""L I V E S"" -> but that's 5 letters? ""LIVES"" -> but V is available? 

   ""L I V E S"" is 5 letters: L, I, V, E, S -> but we have E in 4th? So ""L I V E S"" -> positions: 
        1: L
        2: I
        3: V
        4: E
        5: S

   But the secret word has E in 4th? So that matches? 

   And ""LIVES"" is a word? 

   But note: we have to avoid absent letters? V and S are not in the absent list? 

   So ""LIVES"" is a candidate? 

   But what if the secret word is ""LIVES""? Then we win? 

   But we don't know? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common letters? 

   Another: ""L I K E S"" -> ""LIKES"" -> K is available? 

   ""LIKES"": L I K E S -> avoids absent? 

   But note: we are testing L in 1? 

   If L is not in 1, then we get L marked as '-'? meaning L is present but not in 1? Then we know L is in 5? 

   And we also test K and S? 

   So that's good? 

   But we have to consider that the secret word might have K? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in 5? 

   For example: "" ? I ? E L"" 

   Example: ""O I L E L"" -> but duplicate L? and O in first? 

   ""O I L E L"" is not a word? 

   ""S I Z E L"" -> S I Z E L -> ""SIZEL"" is not a word? 

   ""M I L E L"" -> not a word? 

   ""B I T E L"" -> not a word? 

   ""W I S E L"" -> not a word? 

   ""F I L E L"" -> not a word? 

   ""A I S L E"" -> but A is absent? 

   ""J I V E L"" -> ""JIVEL"" not a word? 

   ""V I E L L"" -> duplicate L? 

   It seems hard to find a word ending with ""IEL"" with E in the fourth? 

   Actually, the word is _ I _ E L -> so the last two letters are E and L? 

   Example: ""T I E L E"" -> but T is absent? 

   ""D I M E L"" -> D is absent? 

   ""B I K E L"" -> ""BIKEL"" not a word? 

   ""S I B E L"" -> ""SIBEL"" not common? 

   ""N I B E L"" -> N absent? 

   So it might be difficult to find a common word with L in the 5th? 

   Therefore, it might be more promising to assume L is in the 1st? 

   And we have words like ""LIVES"", ""LIKES"", etc. 

   But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? 

   Let me list words that fit the pattern for L in 1st: L I ? E ? 

   We have to fill the 3rd and 5th with letters from: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

   Common words:
      ""L I F E S"" -> ""LIFES"" not a word? 
      ""L I V E S"" -> ""LIVES"" (valid)
      ""L I K E S"" -> ""LIKES"" (valid)
      ""L I M E S"" -> ""LIMES"" (valid)
      ""L I N E S"" -> but N is absent? 
      ""L I P E S"" -> P absent? 
      ""L I B E L"" -> ""LIBEL"" (valid) but note: L in first and fifth? 
          If we use ""LIBEL"", then we have L in first and fifth? 
          But we don't know if the word allows two L's? 
          And we have to consider: if the secret word has two L's? 
          In our feedback, we only know that there is at least one L (from guess3). 
          So ""LIBEL"" is a possibility? 

   But if we guess ""LIBEL"", then:
        Position 1: L -> if L is in 1st, then ✓? 
        Position 2: I -> ✓
        Position 3: B -> ?
        Position 4: E -> ✓
        Position 5: L -> if the secret word has L in 5th, then ✓? But if the secret word has only one L (in 1st), then we get L in 5th marked as absent? 

   But we don't know? 

   However, if the secret word has only one L (in 1st), then we would get:
        L(✓) for first, and L(x) for fifth? 
        But we know L is present? So if we get L(x) for fifth, that means the fifth letter is not L? 

   But if the secret word has two L's, then we might get both? 

   But we don't have evidence of two L's? 

   So to avoid complexity, we can choose a word without duplicate L? 

   Therefore, ""LIVES"", ""LIKES"", ""LIMES"" are good? 

   Now, which one? 

   We want to test as many new letters as possible? 

   ""LIVES"": uses V and S? 
   ""LIKES"": uses K and S? 
   ""LIMES"": uses M and S? 

   V, K, M are all not tested? 

   We can choose one? 

   Since S is common, we can test S in the fifth? 

   But we don't know if S is in the word? 

   So I'll choose ""LIKES"" because K is less common? Or ""LIVES"" because V is less common? 

   Actually, we want to maximize the chance of hitting? 

   Common letters: S is more common than V, K, M? 

   So ""LIMES"" has M and S? 

   But we can also choose a word that has S in a different position? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""S"" in a position that might be in the secret word? 

   But we don't know? 

   I think ""LIVES"" is a good choice? 

   But note: we are also testing L in the first? 

   So I'll go with ""LIVES"". 

   Guess: ""LIVES""

   If the secret word is ""LIVES"", we win? 

   If not, we get feedback on V and S? 

   And also, if L is not in first, we get L marked as '-'? 

   But we expect L to be in first? 

   Alternatively, if we get L marked as '-', then we know L is in fifth? 

   So we can then focus on words ending with L? 

   So it's a good test? 

   Therefore, we guess ""LIVES"". 

But wait: what if the secret word has only one L and it is in the fifth? Then in ""LIVES"", we have L in first? 
   We would get: 
        L in first: marked as '-' (because L is present but not in first? and we know it must be in fifth? but we don't have L in fifth in the guess? so we get L marked as present but not in first? and then we know it must be in fifth? 
   And then we also get feedback on V and S? 

   So we can then make a next guess with L in fifth? 

   So it's acceptable? 

   We have 3 guesses left? 

   So I think it's a good move. 

   Let me count the guesses: we are about to make the 4th guess? 

   We have 3 guesses left? 

   So we can do it. 

   Therefore, we guess ""LIVES"". 

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? V and S are not absent? 

Yes.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - C, R, A, N: Absent (x) → Excluded from future guesses.  
   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → E is in the word, **not in position 5**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""eight""**  
   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → E is **not in position 1**.  
   - I: Correct position (✓) → **I is in position 2**.  
   - G, H, T: Absent (x) → Excluded.  

3. **Guess 3: ""piled""**  
   - P: Absent (x) → Excluded.  
   - I: Correct position (✓) → Confirms **I in position 2**.  
   - L: Present but wrong position (-) → **L is in the word, not in position 3**.  
   - E: Correct position (✓) → **E is in position 4**.  
   - D: Absent (x) → Excluded.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ I _ E _` (positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  
  - Position 2 = I (fixed).  
  - Position 4 = E (fixed).  
- **Present letters**: I, E, L.  
  - L must be in **position 1 or 5** (since it can't be in position 3 and positions 2/4 are fixed).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D (excluded).  
- **Available letters**: B, F, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test L in position 1** to resolve its location:  
  - If L is in position 1, we get ✓.  
  - If L is not in position 1, we get (-) → L must be in position 5.  
- **Maximize new information**: Use common letters (S, V) in positions 3 and 5 to test their presence.  
- **Optimal word**: **""LIVES""** fits perfectly:  
  - `L` in position 1 (tests L's location).  
  - `I` in position 2 (✓, confirmed).  
  - `V` in position 3 (new letter).  
  - `E` in position 4 (✓, confirmed).  
  - `S` in position 5 (new letter).  

<guess>lives</guess>",lives,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent. E is present but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
  Meaning: E is present but not in the 1st position. I is present and in the correct position (2nd). G, H, T are absent.

Guess 3: ""piled"" -> P(x), I(✓), L(-), E(✓), D(x)
  Meaning: P is absent. I is correct in the 2nd position (again). L is present but not in the 3rd position. E is present and in the correct position (4th). D is absent.

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. Correctly positioned letters:
   - I is in the 2nd position.
   - E is in the 4th position.

   So the secret word has the form: _ I _ E _

2. Present letters but not in the guessed positions:
   - E was previously marked as present but not in 1st (from guess2) and not in 5th (from guess1). Now we know it is in 4th (from guess3).
   - L is present but not in the 3rd position (from guess3). Since the 4th position is E, L must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th? But wait, the word is _ I _ E _, so positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
        Position 2: I
        Position 4: E
        So L is present and not in 3rd, so it must be in position 1 or 5? But note: we have only 5 positions.

   However, we must consider that L could be in position 1 or 5? But we don't have a 5th position for L? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 5 are open? But we know position 3 was guessed as L in ""piled"" and it was marked as '-', meaning L is not in position 3. So L must be in position 1 or 5.

3. Absent letters:
   From all guesses: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D are absent.

   So absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D.

4. Present letters (including those correctly placed and misplaced):
   - E (in position 4)
   - I (in position 2)
   - L (present, but not in position 3, so must be in 1 or 5)

   Also, from guess1, we know E is present (and now we know it's in 4th). From guess2, I is present (in 2nd). From guess3, L is present (but not in 3rd).

   So the secret word contains at least: I, E, L.

   And we have two positions to fill: 1, 3, and 5? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 5 are unknown, but we know one of position 1 or 5 must be L? And the other two must be filled with letters that are not absent and not already known? 

   But note: the word has 5 letters. We have:
        Position 1: ? (could be L or a new letter)
        Position 2: I
        Position 3: ? 
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: ? 

   And we know L is present and not in 3, so it must be in 1 or 5.

   Therefore, the word has L in either position 1 or 5, and the remaining two positions (if L is in 1, then positions 3 and 5; if L is in 5, then positions 1 and 3) must be filled with letters that are not absent and not I or E (which are already placed).

   But note: the word might have more than one L? The feedback doesn't indicate that. In guess3, we had only one L (in position 3) and it was marked as '-', meaning that L is present but not there. It doesn't say anything about other L's? So it's possible that L appears again? But we don't know.

   However, to be safe, we should consider that L might be only once? Or it might be twice? 

   But since we have limited information, we can assume for now that L appears only once? 

   Actually, the feedback for ""piled"" had only one L and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if there were two L's, we might have gotten two marks? But in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will mark each occurrence appropriately? 

   For example, if the word has two L's and we guess one in the correct position and one in the wrong, we would get one ✓ and one -? But in this case, we only have one L in the guess and it was marked as '-', meaning that there is at least one L that is not in that position. It doesn't rule out the possibility of another L? 

   However, we don't have evidence of a second L? So we can proceed with the assumption that there is only one L? 

   Therefore, L must be in position 1 or 5.

5. Available letters: 
   We have used: C,R,A,N,E,I,G,H,T,P,L,D (from the three guesses). 
   Absent: C,R,A,N,G,H,T,P,D -> so these cannot be used.
   Present: E, I, L (and we know E and I are fixed, L is to be placed).

   The remaining letters (not absent and not yet placed) are: 
        B, F, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

   But note: we have to fill the positions 1, 3, 5, but one of them is L (if L is only once). 

   So the word must have L in either 1 or 5, and the other two positions from the available letters.

   Also, the letter in position 3 must be one of the available letters (and not L, because if L is only once and we place it in 1 or 5, then position 3 cannot be L).

Now, we need to form a guess that helps us determine:
   - Where L is (position 1 or 5)?
   - What are the letters in the remaining positions?

But note: we have two unknowns (if we consider L's position) and three positions? Actually, we have:

Case 1: L in position 1 -> then the word is: L I ? E ? 
   Then positions 3 and 5 must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set (B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) and not L.

Case 2: L in position 5 -> then the word is: ? I ? E L
   Then positions 1 and 3 must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set.

We can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position 1 and then we see? Or in position 5? 

But we don't know? 

We can also choose a word that doesn't include L? But we know L is present? So if we don't include L, we will get an 'x' for L? But we know L is present? So that would be a waste? 

Therefore, we must include L? 

But we don't know if L is in 1 or 5? 

So we have to choose one? 

We can choose a word that has L in position 1? Then if L is in 1, we get ✓ for L? If not, we get '-' meaning L is present but not in 1? Then we know L must be in 5? 

Similarly, if we put L in 5, then if we get ✓ for L, it's in 5? If we get '-', then L is in 1? 

So either way, we can determine L's position? 

But we also want to test the other letters? 

So let's choose a word that has L in position 1? 

Then the pattern: L I ? E ? 

We need to fill positions 3 and 5 with available letters? 

We want to use common letters? 

For example: 
   Position 3: S (common)
   Position 5: O (common) -> ""L I S E O"" -> not a word? 

   ""L I V E S"" -> but that's 5 letters? ""LIVES"" -> but V is available? 

   ""L I V E S"" is 5 letters: L, I, V, E, S -> but we have E in 4th? So ""L I V E S"" -> positions: 
        1: L
        2: I
        3: V
        4: E
        5: S

   But the secret word has E in 4th? So that matches? 

   And ""LIVES"" is a word? 

   But note: we have to avoid absent letters? V and S are not in the absent list? 

   So ""LIVES"" is a candidate? 

   But what if the secret word is ""LIVES""? Then we win? 

   But we don't know? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common letters? 

   Another: ""L I K E S"" -> ""LIKES"" -> K is available? 

   ""LIKES"": L I K E S -> avoids absent? 

   But note: we are testing L in 1? 

   If L is not in 1, then we get L marked as '-'? meaning L is present but not in 1? Then we know L is in 5? 

   And we also test K and S? 

   So that's good? 

   But we have to consider that the secret word might have K? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in 5? 

   For example: "" ? I ? E L"" 

   Example: ""O I L E L"" -> but duplicate L? and O in first? 

   ""O I L E L"" is not a word? 

   ""S I Z E L"" -> S I Z E L -> ""SIZEL"" is not a word? 

   ""M I L E L"" -> not a word? 

   ""B I T E L"" -> not a word? 

   ""W I S E L"" -> not a word? 

   ""F I L E L"" -> not a word? 

   ""A I S L E"" -> but A is absent? 

   ""J I V E L"" -> ""JIVEL"" not a word? 

   ""V I E L L"" -> duplicate L? 

   It seems hard to find a word ending with ""IEL"" with E in the fourth? 

   Actually, the word is _ I _ E L -> so the last two letters are E and L? 

   Example: ""T I E L E"" -> but T is absent? 

   ""D I M E L"" -> D is absent? 

   ""B I K E L"" -> ""BIKEL"" not a word? 

   ""S I B E L"" -> ""SIBEL"" not common? 

   ""N I B E L"" -> N absent? 

   So it might be difficult to find a common word with L in the 5th? 

   Therefore, it might be more promising to assume L is in the 1st? 

   And we have words like ""LIVES"", ""LIKES"", etc. 

   But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? 

   Let me list words that fit the pattern for L in 1st: L I ? E ? 

   We have to fill the 3rd and 5th with letters from: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

   Common words:
      ""L I F E S"" -> ""LIFES"" not a word? 
      ""L I V E S"" -> ""LIVES"" (valid)
      ""L I K E S"" -> ""LIKES"" (valid)
      ""L I M E S"" -> ""LIMES"" (valid)
      ""L I N E S"" -> but N is absent? 
      ""L I P E S"" -> P absent? 
      ""L I B E L"" -> ""LIBEL"" (valid) but note: L in first and fifth? 
          If we use ""LIBEL"", then we have L in first and fifth? 
          But we don't know if the word allows two L's? 
          And we have to consider: if the secret word has two L's? 
          In our feedback, we only know that there is at least one L (from guess3). 
          So ""LIBEL"" is a possibility? 

   But if we guess ""LIBEL"", then:
        Position 1: L -> if L is in 1st, then ✓? 
        Position 2: I -> ✓
        Position 3: B -> ?
        Position 4: E -> ✓
        Position 5: L -> if the secret word has L in 5th, then ✓? But if the secret word has only one L (in 1st), then we get L in 5th marked as absent? 

   But we don't know? 

   However, if the secret word has only one L (in 1st), then we would get:
        L(✓) for first, and L(x) for fifth? 
        But we know L is present? So if we get L(x) for fifth, that means the fifth letter is not L? 

   But if the secret word has two L's, then we might get both? 

   But we don't have evidence of two L's? 

   So to avoid complexity, we can choose a word without duplicate L? 

   Therefore, ""LIVES"", ""LIKES"", ""LIMES"" are good? 

   Now, which one? 

   We want to test as many new letters as possible? 

   ""LIVES"": uses V and S? 
   ""LIKES"": uses K and S? 
   ""LIMES"": uses M and S? 

   V, K, M are all not tested? 

   We can choose one? 

   Since S is common, we can test S in the fifth? 

   But we don't know if S is in the word? 

   So I'll choose ""LIKES"" because K is less common? Or ""LIVES"" because V is less common? 

   Actually, we want to maximize the chance of hitting? 

   Common letters: S is more common than V, K, M? 

   So ""LIMES"" has M and S? 

   But we can also choose a word that has S in a different position? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""S"" in a position that might be in the secret word? 

   But we don't know? 

   I think ""LIVES"" is a good choice? 

   But note: we are also testing L in the first? 

   So I'll go with ""LIVES"". 

   Guess: ""LIVES""

   If the secret word is ""LIVES"", we win? 

   If not, we get feedback on V and S? 

   And also, if L is not in first, we get L marked as '-'? 

   But we expect L to be in first? 

   Alternatively, if we get L marked as '-', then we know L is in fifth? 

   So we can then focus on words ending with L? 

   So it's a good test? 

   Therefore, we guess ""LIVES"". 

But wait: what if the secret word has only one L and it is in the fifth? Then in ""LIVES"", we have L in first? 
   We would get: 
        L in first: marked as '-' (because L is present but not in first? and we know it must be in fifth? but we don't have L in fifth in the guess? so we get L marked as present but not in first? and then we know it must be in fifth? 
   And then we also get feedback on V and S? 

   So we can then make a next guess with L in fifth? 

   So it's acceptable? 

   We have 3 guesses left? 

   So I think it's a good move. 

   Let me count the guesses: we are about to make the 4th guess? 

   We have 3 guesses left? 

   So we can do it. 

   Therefore, we guess ""LIVES"". 

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? V and S are not absent? 

Yes.

So <guess>lives</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - C, R, A, N: Absent (x) → Excluded from future guesses.  
   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → E is in the word, **not in position 5**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""eight""**  
   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → E is **not in position 1**.  
   - I: Correct position (✓) → **I is in position 2**.  
   - G, H, T: Absent (x) → Excluded.  

3. **Guess 3: ""piled""**  
   - P: Absent (x) → Excluded.  
   - I: Correct position (✓) → Confirms **I in position 2**.  
   - L: Present but wrong position (-) → **L is in the word, not in position 3**.  
   - E: Correct position (✓) → **E is in position 4**.  
   - D: Absent (x) → Excluded.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ I _ E _` (positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  
  - Position 2 = I (fixed).  
  - Position 4 = E (fixed).  
- **Present letters**: I, E, L.  
  - L must be in **position 1 or 5** (since it can't be in position 3 and positions 2/4 are fixed).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D (excluded).  
- **Available letters**: B, F, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test L in position 1** to resolve its location:  
  - If L is in position 1, we get ✓.  
  - If L is not in position 1, we get (-) → L must be in position 5.  
- **Maximize new information**: Use common letters (S, V) in positions 3 and 5 to test their presence.  
- **Optimal word**: **""LIVES""** fits perfectly:  
  - `L` in position 1 (tests L's location).  
  - `I` in position 2 (✓, confirmed).  
  - `V` in position 3 (new letter).  
  - `E` in position 4 (✓, confirmed).  
  - `S` in position 5 (new letter).",Guess 4: lives -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(x),FAIL

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 Since C, R, A, and N are all absent, we know that the secret word does not contain these letters.

 The feedback for E was a '-' meaning E is in the word but not in the fifth position (since we guessed it in the fifth position).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, but not at the end. Also, it does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 We have 5 tries left.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Is a 5-letter English word.
 - Avoids the letters C, R, A, N because they are absent.
 - Must contain E (since E is present) but not in the fifth position.

 Additionally, we can use common letters to maximize information.

 Since we know E is in the word, we can try to place E in a different position.

 Common consonants remaining: we can use letters like S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 Let's choose a word that has E in a different position and avoids C,R,A,N.

 We also note that the secret word has E, but not in the fifth position. So E must be in one of positions 1-4.

 Possible starting words: We need a word without C,R,A,N.

 Some options: 
   We could try ""SPIEL"", but let's think of words that have E and other common letters.

 Another idea: ""HOUSE"" -> but note that E is at the end, and we know E isn't at the end? 
   However, our feedback says E is in the word but not in the fifth position. So we cannot put E in the fifth position again.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end? But we are not allowed to put E at the end? 
   Actually, we can put E at the end again? Let me clarify: The feedback says E is present but not in the fifth position. 
   That is, in this particular word, E was in the fifth position and it was wrong. 
   But E might appear more than once? The feedback does not indicate multiple E's. 
   However, the secret word might have only one E? 

 So when we guess, we can try E in a different position. Avoiding fifth.

 Let me avoid E in the fifth position.

 Some words without E at the end:

   First position: ""EAGLE"" -> but A is already eliminated? We know A is not in the word, so ""EAGLE"" has A which is bad.

   Second position: like ""LEMON"" -> but L,E,M,O,N? Wait, N is eliminated! So we cannot use N.

   Third position: ""PLUME"" -> E at the end? Not good.

   Fourth position: ""SMILE"" -> E at the end? Not good.

 We need E not in the fifth. So positions 1,2,3,4.

 Let me think of words with E in the first position that do not contain C,R,A,N.

 Examples: 
   ""EAGLE"" has A -> invalid because A is absent.
   ""EERIE"" has multiple E's? And avoids A,C,N,R? But it has R? Wait, R is absent so we cannot use R? 
   Actually, R is absent so we cannot include R. ""EERIE"" has R? No: EERIE has letters E, E, R, I, E? 
   Actually: E E R I E? That has R? So avoid.

   ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth positions? And avoids A,C,R,N? Letters: E, D, G, E, S -> no C,R,A,N.

   But we don't know if the word has multiple E's? We only know there is at least one E. 
   However, we are trying to maximize new information.

   Another word: ""EBONY"" -> has N? No, we know N is absent. So avoid N.

   ""ELOPE"": Letters: E, L, O, P, E -> avoids C,R,A,N? And E in first and fifth? But we know E is not in fifth? 
   We are not sure about fifth? Actually, our feedback said E is present but not in fifth? 
   So the secret word has at least one E that is not in the fifth position. 
   It could have another E in the fifth? But we don't know.

   However, we want to avoid the fifth position for E because we know that the fifth letter is not E? 
   Actually, the feedback tells us that the fifth letter was not E in the secret word? 
   Our guess ""crane"" had E at the fifth, and it was marked as '-' meaning E is in the word but not at that spot. 
   So the fifth letter of the secret word is not E. Therefore, we should avoid putting E in the fifth again? 
   But we can put it again? It doesn't matter because we are trying to learn more.

   However, we already know E is not in fifth? So we should try E in a different position.

   Let's choose a word with E not in fifth and without C,R,A,N.

   Words with E in position 1: 
      ELBOW -> letters: E, L, B, O, W -> avoids A,C,R,N?
      ELITE -> E, L, I, T, E -> but we use E twice? And avoids C,R,A,N? 
          However, note: we don't know if the secret word has two E's? So it's okay.

   But let's look for words with more common letters.

   Another common letter is T, so I might want to include T.

   Word with E in second position? 
      ""TEETH"" -> E in second and fourth? But T is used twice? 
      But avoids A,C,R,N? 
          Also, we don't know about T? 

   We haven't tested T yet? So we can use T.

   Common starting words with E and avoiding C,R,A,N: 
      ""SLATE"" -> S,L,A,T,E? But A is eliminated -> invalid.
      ""ROAST"" -> has R and A -> invalid.

   How about ""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? But E is at the fourth position? And the fifth letter is L? 

   But note: we need words without A, R, N, C.

   Another: ""BOWEL"": B,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? 

   But we also want to test more new letters.

   Let's list available letters: we haven't used many.

   We know E is present. We have used C,R,A,N,E (from first guess). 

   So available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

   We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter in the secret word.

   Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, S, T, L, O, I, ... but we already know E is there.

   So include S, T, L, O.

   How about a word that has E and S, T, L, O? Without using C,R,A,N.

   Example: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        But note: ""STOLE"" has E at the end? We don't want to put E at the end? 
        Because we know the fifth letter is not E? 
        But we can use it to test other positions? 

        We are forced to put E somewhere? The feedback does not forbid E at the end? 
        We just know that it's not in the fifth position? So putting E at the end again would not help? 
        Because we already know E is present and not at the fifth? 

        However, the secret word might have E at more than one position? 
        We don't know. So by putting E at the end again, if the secret word has two E's? 
        Then we would get '-' for E again? 

        Alternatively, we might learn about other letters.

   Since we have E present, we can try to place it in a different position to see where it goes.

   Why not put E at the beginning? 

   Let me choose ""ELOPS"": but I'm not sure if it's a valid word? 

   Alternatively, ""STOLE"" is valid? But E at the end is redundant? 

   Another word: ""HOMES"" -> H,O,M,E,S -> E is fourth? 
   Also, avoids A,C,R,N? 

   Or ""TIMES"": T,I,M,E,S -> E in fourth? 

   Or ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> E in fifth? We avoid fifth? 

   Let's avoid E in fifth? 

   How about ""TILES"": T,I,L,E,S -> E in fourth? 
   But that's one letter? 

   Another idea: ""FLUID"", but no E? We must include E? Or we don't have to? 
   Actually, we don't have to include E? But note: the feedback only tells us that E is in the word? 
   But we have not confirmed where? So including E in a different position might help locate it.

   However, if we don't include E, we might not get information about E? But we already know E is present? 
   So we can choose words without E? That might help test other letters? 

   The rules say we can guess any valid word? But strategically, we want to find the word quickly.

   Since we know E is present, and we don't know its position, we should try E in a different position? 

   So I think we should put E in one of positions 1 to 4.

   Let me choose a word with E in the first position: 
      ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. 
      This way, if E is in the first position, we get a ✓ for E? Otherwise, if E is not in first, but in the word, we get a '-'? 

   Alternatively, we can put E in a more common position? 

   Common positions for E: not at the end? Then in the middle? 

   According to feedback, E was at fifth and that was wrong? So E must be in 1,2,3,4.

   We can also try E in the second position? 

   Let me pick a word with E in the second position and common letters: 
      ""BELLY"": B,E,L,L,Y -> but double L? 
      ""TEETH"": double E? 
      ""BESTI"": no.

   How about ""METAL""? But A is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""LEMON"": but L,E,M,O,N? We have N? N is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""PETOS"": not a word? 

   Let me think: without A and N, and with E in second? 
      ""HELIO"" is not 5 letters? 
      ""DEUCE"" but D,E,U,C,E? C is eliminated -> invalid.

   Words with E in the third position: 
      ""CRUES"" -> C is eliminated -> invalid?
      ""SPIEL"": S,P,I,E,L -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        E is fourth? Wait: S P I E L -> third letter I, fourth E? 
        We want E in third? 

   Actually: 
      ""GRUEL"" -> G,R,U,E,L? R is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""SUEDE"": S,U,E,D,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. But E in third and fifth? 
        Fifth: we know E is not fifth? So we get '-' for third position? Or if the word has only one E? 

   This is getting messy.

   Since we have eliminated only 4 letters (C,R,A,N) and have 22 left? 

   Let's choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible? And put E in a non-fifth position.

   Example: ""SPIEL"" -> 
        letters: S, P, I, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.
        E is in the fifth? Wait: 
            P-O-S-I-T-I-O-N: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E? Wait, it's S-P-I-E-L -> so E is fourth? 
            So E in fourth position? 
        Then fifth is L? 
        That's fine.

   Or ""TOWED"": T,O,W,E,D -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fourth? 

   Or ""MOVIE"": M,O,V,I,E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fifth? We avoid? 

   So ""SPIEL"" sounds good: 
        S, P, I, E, L -> no duplicates? 

   We'll use that? 

   But note: we must be cautious: E is in fourth position? 

   What if the secret word has E in the first position? Then we would get S,P,I -> all absent? 
   And E as '-', L absent? That might not be informative? 

   Alternatively, we can use a word that starts with E? 

   Let me look for a better word? 

   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E at the end? We avoid? 

   ""STOLE"": E at the end? We avoid? 

   But we can try ""STEEL""? But not 5 distinct letters? 

   How about ""KELP""? Not 5 letters? 

   I think ""QUEST"": Q,U,E,S,T -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in third? 
        But Q is uncommon? 

   Let me go with ""SPIEL"". 

   So we guess ""SPIEL""? 

   But note: we might get more information.

   Alternatively, we can try ""E"", in the first position? 

   Let me decide: 

   Option 1: ""ELTCH"" (not a word) -> no.

   Option 2: ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth? Avoid C,R,A,N? Yes. Letters: E,D,G,E,S -> duplicates E? 
        If we guess it, the duplicate E might be confusing? 
        But the feedback will show: 
            First E: ✓ or -? 
            Fourth E? If the word has only one E and in the first? Then we get E(✓) and then E(x) for fourth? 
            Or if it also has E elsewhere? 

   But we don't know? 

   How about ""STOLE""? Even though E is at the end? We know the fifth letter is not E. 
        But if we put E at the end again, then the feedback for E will be '-', meaning E is present but not at fifth? 
        But we already know that? And we might learn about the other positions? 

        Actually, we haven't tested the fifth letter? We only know it's not E? So we can test other letters? 

        So ""STOLE"" has E at fifth? And we know it's not E? So we expect a '-' for E? 
        But we will learn about S,T,O,L: 
            If any of them are in the word? 

        However, we are testing S,T,O,L? 

        Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" tests S,P,I,E,L? 

        Either is fine? 

   Considering that E is already known to be present? Maybe we can avoid including E? 

   Actually, we have 5 guesses left? And we don't lose much? 

   However, we want to cover common letters? 

   Common letters: S, T, L, O, I are common? 

   So ""STOLE"" tests S,T,O,L,E? 
   But E at fifth: we expect a '-'? 
   Then we would get: 
        S at position 1 -> (✓ or - or x)
        T at 2 -> similarly
        O at 3 -> similarly
        L at 4 -> similarly
        E at 5 -> will be '-' (as expected)

   Since we know E is present? Then regardless of other letters? 

   But we are testing 5 letters? With E being known? 

   Alternatively, I found a word: ""STILE"" (a type of ladder)? S,T,I,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        Also, E is at fifth? And we avoid fifth? 

   But note: we haven't tried words with E not at fifth? 

   Given that we already know E is present and not at fifth, we might try to find E's position by putting it in an early position? 

   Let me choose a word that starts with E? 

   Example: ""ELAND""? Has A? A is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""EDGED""? Doubled E and D? 

   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.
        E in first? 
        This tests E,I,G,H,T? 

   Also, ""INLET"": I,N,L,E,T -> has N? Eliminated? 

   ""EASEL""? has A and E doubled? 

   ""EVITE"": E,V,I,T,E -> avoid? 

   ""ETUDE"": E,T,U,D,E -> avoid duplicates? 

   ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

        So ""EXIST"": E(1), X(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). 
        But T is at fifth? We don't know about T? 

   But note, we don't want to use fifth for E? But fifth here is T? 

   So ""EXIST"" has E at first? 

   I think ""EXIST"" or ""EIGHT""?

   Commonality: S is more common than G and H? 

   So ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> it tests E at first? 

   We might get E(✓) if E is at first? 

   Otherwise, E(-) if E is elsewhere? 

   So let me choose a word like ""EXIST"".

   We have to decide.

   Given the above, I will choose ""EXIST"". 

   So our second guess: ""EXIST""

   But let me see: 
        We avoid C,R,A,N? Yes: E,X,I,S,T doesn't have any of C,R,A,N.

   So guess ""EXIST"".

   Alternatively, if we want to avoid X? because X is rare? 

   Then ""MIDST"" -> M,I,D,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        But doesn't include E? Then we don't test E? 
        But we know E is present? So by not including E, we might get no feedback for E? 
        And then we don't learn about the position? 
        However, we will learn about these letters? 

        But if the word has E, and E is in ""MIDST"", we would not learn its position? 

        Actually, the feedback will still be: 
            If M is not in word -> x
            I -> if in word and in position: ✓ or -? 
            D -> same
            S -> same
            T -> same

        And if E is in the word? It doesn't come up? 

        So we don't get info on E? 

        That's bad because we know E is present? 

        We should include E? 

   Therefore, we must include E? 

   So I go with ""EXIST"" or ""SPIEL""? 

   After consideration, let me choose ""SPIEL"": 
        Reason: It includes E (but not fifth? fourth instead) and avoids C,R,A,N? 
        Also, letters S,P,I,E,L -> common letters? 

   We'll guess ""SPIEL"".

   But note: position of E? In ""SPIEL"" the positions are: 
        1: S
        2: P
        3: I
        4: E
        5: L

   So we are testing E in fourth? 

   If the secret word has E in fourth? We get ✓ for E? 
   Otherwise, if it has E elsewhere? Then '-' for E? 

   But let's hope we get some other hits? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word with E in the first? 

   Since we don't know? But time is short? 

   Another common word: ""POUND"" -> skip because we don't have E? 

   We must include E? 

   So ""QUEUE"" is not helpful? 

   Final: Guess ""SPIEL""

   Or ""E"", first: ""ENTRY"" -> has N? and R? -> invalid.

   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        And E in first? 

   I think ""EIGHT"" is a good word? 

   So I'll choose ""EIGHT""

   Why? It tests E at position 1? And I,G,H,T? 

   We haven't tested G,H,T,I? 

   Common letters: I, T, H are common? 

   Let's do ""EIGHT""

   So guess: ""EIGHT""

   Second guess: ""eight""

   But note: E is at first? 

   We expect if E is first, ✓. If not, then '-' because we know E is present? 

   But what if the secret word has no E at the first? Then we get '-' and we know E is in the word? 

   So this is acceptable.

   We proceed with ""EIGHT"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked as ""-"").

This means:
- The secret word contains the letter E, located in positions 1–4.
- The letters C, R, A, and N must be excluded from all subsequent guesses.

For the next guess:
- We need to include E in a different position (anywhere except the 5th) to help identify its correct location.
- Letters like T, I, G, and H are strong choices because they are common in English words and haven't been tested yet.
- ""EIGHT"" aligns with these criteria: 
  - E is placed in position 1 (testing if E appears there).
  - T, I, G, and H are new letters that maximize information gain.
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

This guess will help narrow down the position of E and test four additional common letters efficiently.

<guess>eight</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
  C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.
  E is present but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
Meaning:
  E is present but not in the 1st position (since we guessed it in the first position and got '-'). 
  I is present and in the correct position (2nd position, because in ""eight"", I is the second letter).
  G, H, T are absent.

So from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T
Present letters: E (but not in 1st or 5th position) and I (which is in the 2nd position).

Therefore, the secret word has:
  - The second letter is I.
  - The letter E is present, but not in the 1st, 2nd (because second is I), or 5th position. So E must be in the 3rd or 4th position.

We also know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

We have 4 tries left.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
  - Has 5 letters, all from the remaining possible letters (excluding absent ones).
  - Must have I in the second position.
  - Must include E in either the 3rd or 4th position (to check which one).
  - Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

Available letters: 
  We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, G, H, T (from the two guesses). 
  But note: E and I are present, so they are still in play (but we know I is fixed at position 2).

  The alphabet without the absent letters: 
    B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

  And we know E must be included (but not in 1st, 2nd, or 5th) and I is fixed at position 2.

So the secret word pattern is: 
  Position 1: one of B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but not E, because E is not in 1st)
  Position 2: I (fixed)
  Position 3: either E or one of the available letters? But note: E must be in the word, and it can only be in 3rd or 4th. So either position 3 or 4 must be E.
  Position 4: similarly, if E is not in 3rd, then it must be in 4th.
  Position 5: one of the available letters (but not E, because E is not in 5th).

We can try to form a word that has I in the second position and E in the third position? Or in the fourth?

We should also try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Option 1: Assume E is in the 3rd position -> pattern: _ I E _ _
Option 2: Assume E is in the 4th position -> pattern: _ I _ E _

We don't know which, so we can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in the 3rd position and then if it's not there, we know it must be in the 4th? 

But we can also choose a word that doesn't have E at all? But we must include E because we know it's present? 

Wait, we must include E? Actually, we don't have to? But if we don't include E, then we won't get information about E's position? 

But we know E is present? So if we don't include E, we will get all the other letters' feedback, but we won't learn about E? 

However, we can still get the feedback for the letters we do include? 

But we have limited guesses? So it's better to include E to try to locate it? 

So let's include E in either the 3rd or 4th position? 

We can choose a word that has E in the 3rd position? 

For example: 
  Pattern: _ I E _ _

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with available letters.

Available letters: B,D,F,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: S, L, O, P, D, etc.

Example words: 
  ""SIEVE"" -> S I E V E -> but E is in 3rd and 5th? But we cannot have E in 5th? 
      Also, V is present? 
      But note: we are going to put E in 3rd? and 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? So we cannot use E in 5th? 
      So ""SIEVE"" is invalid because it has E in 5th? 

  ""SIEVE"" is not allowed? Because we know E is not in 5th? So we must avoid E in 5th? 

  ""DIET_"" -> but we need 5 letters? ""DIETS"" -> D I E T S -> but T is absent? T is eliminated? 

  ""LIEU_"" -> ""LIEUS"" (a word? meaning a unit of the French currency) -> L I E U S -> avoids absent letters? 
        Letters: L, I, E, U, S -> all allowed? 
        But E is in 3rd? 
        And no E in 5th? 

  ""BIELD"" (Scottish word for shelter) -> B I E L D -> avoids absent letters? 
        B, I, E, L, D -> all allowed? 

  ""PIECE"" -> P I E C E -> but C is absent? 

  ""FIELD"" -> F I E L D -> avoids absent letters? 
        F, I, E, L, D -> all allowed? 

  ""WIELD"" -> W I E L D -> same.

  ""PIEZO"" -> P I E Z O -> avoids absent? 

But note: we are not sure if these words are in the word list? 

Alternatively, we can try E in the 4th position? 

Pattern: _ I _ E _

Example: 
  ""SIRED"" -> S I R E D -> but R is absent? 
  ""FILED"" -> F I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        F, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 

  ""MILER"" -> M I L E R -> R absent? 
  ""BIDES"" -> B I D E S -> avoids absent? 

  ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S -> avoids absent? 

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

We can choose either pattern? 

But we want to maximize information? 

We know that E is either in 3rd or 4th? So if we choose a word with E in 3rd, we can test that hypothesis? 

If we get E(✓) in 3rd, then we know E is in 3rd? 
If we get E(-) in 3rd, then E is not in 3rd? So it must be in 4th? 

Similarly, if we put E in 4th? 

So either way, we can get the position? 

But we also want to test other letters? 

So let's choose a word that has E in 3rd and has common letters? 

I'll go with ""FIELD"": F I E L D -> 
  F: new letter
  I: already known to be in second? so we expect ✓ for I? 
  E: in 3rd? we test if E is in 3rd? 
  L: new letter? 
  D: new letter? 

But note: we are using F, L, D? 

Alternatively, ""WIELD"": W I E L D -> same? 

But ""FIELD"" is more common? 

However, we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't know? 

But we haven't seen any repeated letters so far? 

Another idea: we can choose a word that has E in 3rd and also includes other common letters? 

But we have limited letters? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in 4th? 

But let's stick with E in 3rd? 

I choose ""FIELD"". 

But wait: what if the secret word is ""FIELD""? Then we win? 

But we don't know? 

But let's see: 
  If we guess ""FIELD"", and the secret word has E in 3rd? Then we get:
      F: ? 
      I: ✓ (because second is I)
      E: ✓ (if E is in 3rd) 
      L: ? 
      D: ?

  If the secret word is ""FIELD"", then we get all ✓? 

  But if not, we get feedback on F, L, D? 

  Also, if E is not in 3rd, then we get E(-) meaning E is present but not in 3rd? Then we know E must be in 4th? 

So it's a good test? 

But note: we are using F, L, D? 

We could use more common letters? 

Common letters: S, O, L, D, etc. 

How about ""SILED""? Not a common word? 

""OILED"": O I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        O, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 
        But E is in 4th? 

But we are testing E in 4th? 

We can do that? 

But we don't know if E is in 3rd or 4th? 

So if we choose ""OILED"", we are testing E in 4th? 

If we get E(✓) in 4th, then we know E is in 4th? 
If we get E(-) in 4th, then E is not in 4th? So it must be in 3rd? 

So both ""FIELD"" (E in 3rd) and ""OILED"" (E in 4th) are valid? 

But we can only choose one? 

I think we should choose one that uses more common letters? 

""OILED"" has O, L, D? 

""FIELD"" has F, L, D? 

O is more common than F? 

But we don't know? 

Another word: ""SIDLE"": S I D L E -> but E is in 5th? Not allowed? 

""QUIET"": Q U I E T -> T is absent? 

""JUICY"": J U I C Y -> C absent? 

""PILED"": P I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        P, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 
        E in 4th? 

""PILED"" is a word? 

Similarly, ""WIPED"": W I P E D -> avoids absent? 

But we have to avoid T? 

I think ""PILED"" is a good choice? 

But let me compare:

  ""FIELD"": tests E in 3rd, and letters F, L, D? 
  ""PILED"": tests E in 4th, and letters P, L, D? 

We already know I is in second? 

In ""PILED"", the I is in second? So we expect I(✓). 

We can choose either? 

But note: we haven't tested S? S is a very common letter? 

So maybe we should include S? 

Pattern for E in 3rd: _ I E _ _ 
  With S: 
      Position 1: S -> ""SIE??"" 
      We need two more letters? 
      Example: ""SIEVE"" -> invalid because of E at the end? 
      ""SIEGE"" -> S I E G E -> but G is absent? 
      ""SIECE"" -> not a word? 
      ""SIELD"" -> not a word? 
      ""SIEUR"" -> S I E U R -> R is absent? 

Pattern for E in 4th: _ I _ E _ 
  With S: 
      ""S I ? E ?"" 
      Example: ""SIRED"" -> R absent? 
      ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S -> avoids absent? 
          D is allowed? 
          But note: S is used twice? 
          Also, E is in 4th? 
          And fifth is S? 
          So ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S? 
          But we don't know if the word allows duplicates? 

      ""SINES"" -> S I N E S -> N is absent? 
      ""SILES"" -> not a word? 
      ""SITES"" -> T is absent? 
      ""SIVES"" -> not common? 

  ""SIXES"" -> S I X E S -> avoids absent? 
        But X is allowed? 
        And S is duplicated? 

  ""SIZES"" -> S I Z E S -> avoids absent? 

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

The rules don't say? But in Wordle, duplicates are allowed? 

But in our feedback, we haven't seen any duplicates? 

But the secret word might have duplicates? 

However, to be safe, we can avoid duplicates? 

So ""SIDES"" is a word? And it has two S's? 

But we are testing S in first and fifth? 

If the secret word has only one S? Then we might get S(✓) and S(x) for the fifth? 

But it's acceptable? 

But we are not sure? 

Alternatively, without duplicates: 

  ""SIXES"" has two S's? 

  ""SIXTH"" -> T and H absent? 

  ""SIXTY"" -> T absent? 

  ""SILED"" -> S I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        S, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 
        E in 4th? 

  ""SILED"" is a word? (past tense of sile: to descend, as a hawk) 

  But not common? 

  ""SIPED"" -> not a word? 

  ""SIMES"" -> not a word? 

  ""SIBYL"" -> S I B Y L -> avoids absent? 
        But no E? We must include E? 

  We must include E? 

  So ""SILED"" is acceptable? 

  But we are testing E in 4th? 

  Similarly, we can do ""SIDED"" -> but D repeated? 

  ""SIDED"" has two D's? 

  ""SIDLE"" -> S I D L E -> E in fifth? Not allowed? 

So I think ""SILED"" is acceptable? 

But to use common words, I'll avoid ""SILED"". 

Another common word: ""DOILY"" -> no E? 

We must include E? 

So I think ""PILED"" is a common word? 

I'll go with ""PILED"": 
  P I L E D 
  This tests:
      P in first? 
      I in second: ✓ (we know)
      L in third? 
      E in fourth? 
      D in fifth? 

  If E is in fourth, we get E(✓) and then we know the position? 
  If E is not in fourth, we get E(-) meaning E is present but not in fourth? Then we know E must be in third? 

  Also, we test P, L, D? 

  So we get information on three new letters? 

  And we avoid the absent letters? 

  So I choose ""PILED"". 

But note: we are testing E in the fourth position? 

Alternatively, we can test E in the third? 

But we have to choose one? 

I think it's symmetric? 

So I'll go with ""PILED"". 

Guess: ""PILED""

But let me confirm: 
  We have not used P, L, D before? 
  And we avoid C,R,A,N,G,H,T? 

Yes.

So <guess>piled</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A, N are absent (x), E is present but not in the 5th position (-).
- **Guess 2: ""eight""** → E is present but not in the 1st position (-), I is correct and in the 2nd position (✓), and G, H, T are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
1. **I is fixed in the 2nd position** of the secret word.
2. **E is present** but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since position 2 is I, and E was misplaced in positions 1 and 5). Thus, E must be in **position 3 or 4**.
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T (cannot be used).
4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **E in the 4th position** to narrow down its location (if E is not in the 4th, it must be in the 3rd).
- Include **new common letters** (P, L, D) to maximize information.
- Use a valid word that fits the pattern `_ I _ E _` and avoids absent letters.

The word **""PILED""** is chosen because:
- It places I in the 2nd position (✓, as required).
- It tests E in the 4th position (if E is here, it will be ✓; if not, E must be in the 3rd).
- It introduces three new common letters (P, L, D) to check for presence/position.
- It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, N, G, H, T).

<guess>piled</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)
Guess 3: piled -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) L(-) E(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent. E is present but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
  Meaning: E is present but not in the 1st position. I is present and in the correct position (2nd). G, H, T are absent.

Guess 3: ""piled"" -> P(x), I(✓), L(-), E(✓), D(x)
  Meaning: P is absent. I is correct in the 2nd position (again). L is present but not in the 3rd position. E is present and in the correct position (4th). D is absent.

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. Correctly positioned letters:
   - I is in the 2nd position.
   - E is in the 4th position.

   So the secret word has the form: _ I _ E _

2. Present letters but not in the guessed positions:
   - E was previously marked as present but not in 1st (from guess2) and not in 5th (from guess1). Now we know it is in 4th (from guess3).
   - L is present but not in the 3rd position (from guess3). Since the 4th position is E, L must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th? But wait, the word is _ I _ E _, so positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
        Position 2: I
        Position 4: E
        So L is present and not in 3rd, so it must be in position 1 or 5? But note: we have only 5 positions.

   However, we must consider that L could be in position 1 or 5? But we don't have a 5th position for L? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 5 are open? But we know position 3 was guessed as L in ""piled"" and it was marked as '-', meaning L is not in position 3. So L must be in position 1 or 5.

3. Absent letters:
   From all guesses: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D are absent.

   So absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D.

4. Present letters (including those correctly placed and misplaced):
   - E (in position 4)
   - I (in position 2)
   - L (present, but not in position 3, so must be in 1 or 5)

   Also, from guess1, we know E is present (and now we know it's in 4th). From guess2, I is present (in 2nd). From guess3, L is present (but not in 3rd).

   So the secret word contains at least: I, E, L.

   And we have two positions to fill: 1, 3, and 5? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 5 are unknown, but we know one of position 1 or 5 must be L? And the other two must be filled with letters that are not absent and not already known? 

   But note: the word has 5 letters. We have:
        Position 1: ? (could be L or a new letter)
        Position 2: I
        Position 3: ? 
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: ? 

   And we know L is present and not in 3, so it must be in 1 or 5.

   Therefore, the word has L in either position 1 or 5, and the remaining two positions (if L is in 1, then positions 3 and 5; if L is in 5, then positions 1 and 3) must be filled with letters that are not absent and not I or E (which are already placed).

   But note: the word might have more than one L? The feedback doesn't indicate that. In guess3, we had only one L (in position 3) and it was marked as '-', meaning that L is present but not there. It doesn't say anything about other L's? So it's possible that L appears again? But we don't know.

   However, to be safe, we should consider that L might be only once? Or it might be twice? 

   But since we have limited information, we can assume for now that L appears only once? 

   Actually, the feedback for ""piled"" had only one L and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if there were two L's, we might have gotten two marks? But in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will mark each occurrence appropriately? 

   For example, if the word has two L's and we guess one in the correct position and one in the wrong, we would get one ✓ and one -? But in this case, we only have one L in the guess and it was marked as '-', meaning that there is at least one L that is not in that position. It doesn't rule out the possibility of another L? 

   However, we don't have evidence of a second L? So we can proceed with the assumption that there is only one L? 

   Therefore, L must be in position 1 or 5.

5. Available letters: 
   We have used: C,R,A,N,E,I,G,H,T,P,L,D (from the three guesses). 
   Absent: C,R,A,N,G,H,T,P,D -> so these cannot be used.
   Present: E, I, L (and we know E and I are fixed, L is to be placed).

   The remaining letters (not absent and not yet placed) are: 
        B, F, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

   But note: we have to fill the positions 1, 3, 5, but one of them is L (if L is only once). 

   So the word must have L in either 1 or 5, and the other two positions from the available letters.

   Also, the letter in position 3 must be one of the available letters (and not L, because if L is only once and we place it in 1 or 5, then position 3 cannot be L).

Now, we need to form a guess that helps us determine:
   - Where L is (position 1 or 5)?
   - What are the letters in the remaining positions?

But note: we have two unknowns (if we consider L's position) and three positions? Actually, we have:

Case 1: L in position 1 -> then the word is: L I ? E ? 
   Then positions 3 and 5 must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set (B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) and not L.

Case 2: L in position 5 -> then the word is: ? I ? E L
   Then positions 1 and 3 must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set.

We can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position 1 and then we see? Or in position 5? 

But we don't know? 

We can also choose a word that doesn't include L? But we know L is present? So if we don't include L, we will get an 'x' for L? But we know L is present? So that would be a waste? 

Therefore, we must include L? 

But we don't know if L is in 1 or 5? 

So we have to choose one? 

We can choose a word that has L in position 1? Then if L is in 1, we get ✓ for L? If not, we get '-' meaning L is present but not in 1? Then we know L must be in 5? 

Similarly, if we put L in 5, then if we get ✓ for L, it's in 5? If we get '-', then L is in 1? 

So either way, we can determine L's position? 

But we also want to test the other letters? 

So let's choose a word that has L in position 1? 

Then the pattern: L I ? E ? 

We need to fill positions 3 and 5 with available letters? 

We want to use common letters? 

For example: 
   Position 3: S (common)
   Position 5: O (common) -> ""L I S E O"" -> not a word? 

   ""L I V E S"" -> but that's 5 letters? ""LIVES"" -> but V is available? 

   ""L I V E S"" is 5 letters: L, I, V, E, S -> but we have E in 4th? So ""L I V E S"" -> positions: 
        1: L
        2: I
        3: V
        4: E
        5: S

   But the secret word has E in 4th? So that matches? 

   And ""LIVES"" is a word? 

   But note: we have to avoid absent letters? V and S are not in the absent list? 

   So ""LIVES"" is a candidate? 

   But what if the secret word is ""LIVES""? Then we win? 

   But we don't know? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common letters? 

   Another: ""L I K E S"" -> ""LIKES"" -> K is available? 

   ""LIKES"": L I K E S -> avoids absent? 

   But note: we are testing L in 1? 

   If L is not in 1, then we get L marked as '-'? meaning L is present but not in 1? Then we know L is in 5? 

   And we also test K and S? 

   So that's good? 

   But we have to consider that the secret word might have K? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in 5? 

   For example: "" ? I ? E L"" 

   Example: ""O I L E L"" -> but duplicate L? and O in first? 

   ""O I L E L"" is not a word? 

   ""S I Z E L"" -> S I Z E L -> ""SIZEL"" is not a word? 

   ""M I L E L"" -> not a word? 

   ""B I T E L"" -> not a word? 

   ""W I S E L"" -> not a word? 

   ""F I L E L"" -> not a word? 

   ""A I S L E"" -> but A is absent? 

   ""J I V E L"" -> ""JIVEL"" not a word? 

   ""V I E L L"" -> duplicate L? 

   It seems hard to find a word ending with ""IEL"" with E in the fourth? 

   Actually, the word is _ I _ E L -> so the last two letters are E and L? 

   Example: ""T I E L E"" -> but T is absent? 

   ""D I M E L"" -> D is absent? 

   ""B I K E L"" -> ""BIKEL"" not a word? 

   ""S I B E L"" -> ""SIBEL"" not common? 

   ""N I B E L"" -> N absent? 

   So it might be difficult to find a common word with L in the 5th? 

   Therefore, it might be more promising to assume L is in the 1st? 

   And we have words like ""LIVES"", ""LIKES"", etc. 

   But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? 

   Let me list words that fit the pattern for L in 1st: L I ? E ? 

   We have to fill the 3rd and 5th with letters from: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

   Common words:
      ""L I F E S"" -> ""LIFES"" not a word? 
      ""L I V E S"" -> ""LIVES"" (valid)
      ""L I K E S"" -> ""LIKES"" (valid)
      ""L I M E S"" -> ""LIMES"" (valid)
      ""L I N E S"" -> but N is absent? 
      ""L I P E S"" -> P absent? 
      ""L I B E L"" -> ""LIBEL"" (valid) but note: L in first and fifth? 
          If we use ""LIBEL"", then we have L in first and fifth? 
          But we don't know if the word allows two L's? 
          And we have to consider: if the secret word has two L's? 
          In our feedback, we only know that there is at least one L (from guess3). 
          So ""LIBEL"" is a possibility? 

   But if we guess ""LIBEL"", then:
        Position 1: L -> if L is in 1st, then ✓? 
        Position 2: I -> ✓
        Position 3: B -> ?
        Position 4: E -> ✓
        Position 5: L -> if the secret word has L in 5th, then ✓? But if the secret word has only one L (in 1st), then we get L in 5th marked as absent? 

   But we don't know? 

   However, if the secret word has only one L (in 1st), then we would get:
        L(✓) for first, and L(x) for fifth? 
        But we know L is present? So if we get L(x) for fifth, that means the fifth letter is not L? 

   But if the secret word has two L's, then we might get both? 

   But we don't have evidence of two L's? 

   So to avoid complexity, we can choose a word without duplicate L? 

   Therefore, ""LIVES"", ""LIKES"", ""LIMES"" are good? 

   Now, which one? 

   We want to test as many new letters as possible? 

   ""LIVES"": uses V and S? 
   ""LIKES"": uses K and S? 
   ""LIMES"": uses M and S? 

   V, K, M are all not tested? 

   We can choose one? 

   Since S is common, we can test S in the fifth? 

   But we don't know if S is in the word? 

   So I'll choose ""LIKES"" because K is less common? Or ""LIVES"" because V is less common? 

   Actually, we want to maximize the chance of hitting? 

   Common letters: S is more common than V, K, M? 

   So ""LIMES"" has M and S? 

   But we can also choose a word that has S in a different position? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""S"" in a position that might be in the secret word? 

   But we don't know? 

   I think ""LIVES"" is a good choice? 

   But note: we are also testing L in the first? 

   So I'll go with ""LIVES"". 

   Guess: ""LIVES""

   If the secret word is ""LIVES"", we win? 

   If not, we get feedback on V and S? 

   And also, if L is not in first, we get L marked as '-'? 

   But we expect L to be in first? 

   Alternatively, if we get L marked as '-', then we know L is in fifth? 

   So we can then focus on words ending with L? 

   So it's a good test? 

   Therefore, we guess ""LIVES"". 

But wait: what if the secret word has only one L and it is in the fifth? Then in ""LIVES"", we have L in first? 
   We would get: 
        L in first: marked as '-' (because L is present but not in first? and we know it must be in fifth? but we don't have L in fifth in the guess? so we get L marked as present but not in first? and then we know it must be in fifth? 
   And then we also get feedback on V and S? 

   So we can then make a next guess with L in fifth? 

   So it's acceptable? 

   We have 3 guesses left? 

   So I think it's a good move. 

   Let me count the guesses: we are about to make the 4th guess? 

   We have 3 guesses left? 

   So we can do it. 

   Therefore, we guess ""LIVES"". 

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? V and S are not absent? 

Yes.

So <guess>lives</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - C, R, A, N: Absent (x) → Excluded from future guesses.  
   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → E is in the word, **not in position 5**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""eight""**  
   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → E is **not in position 1**.  
   - I: Correct position (✓) → **I is in position 2**.  
   - G, H, T: Absent (x) → Excluded.  

3. **Guess 3: ""piled""**  
   - P: Absent (x) → Excluded.  
   - I: Correct position (✓) → Confirms **I in position 2**.  
   - L: Present but wrong position (-) → **L is in the word, not in position 3**.  
   - E: Correct position (✓) → **E is in position 4**.  
   - D: Absent (x) → Excluded.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ I _ E _` (positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  
  - Position 2 = I (fixed).  
  - Position 4 = E (fixed).  
- **Present letters**: I, E, L.  
  - L must be in **position 1 or 5** (since it can't be in position 3 and positions 2/4 are fixed).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D (excluded).  
- **Available letters**: B, F, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test L in position 1** to resolve its location:  
  - If L is in position 1, we get ✓.  
  - If L is not in position 1, we get (-) → L must be in position 5.  
- **Maximize new information**: Use common letters (S, V) in positions 3 and 5 to test their presence.  
- **Optimal word**: **""LIVES""** fits perfectly:  
  - `L` in position 1 (tests L's location).  
  - `I` in position 2 (✓, confirmed).  
  - `V` in position 3 (new letter).  
  - `E` in position 4 (✓, confirmed).  
  - `S` in position 5 (new letter).

And avoids A,C,N,R? But it has R? Wait, R is absent so we cannot use R? \n   Actually, R is absent so we cannot include R. ""EERIE"" has R? No: EERIE has letters E, E, R, I, E? \n   Actually: E E R I E? That has R? So avoid.\n\n   ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth positions? And avoids A,C,R,N? Letters: E, D, G, E, S -> no C,R,A,N.\n\n   But we don\'t know if the word has multiple E\'s? We only know there is at least one E. \n   However, we are trying to maximize new information.\n\n   Another word: ""EBONY"" -> has N? No, we know N is absent. So avoid N.\n\n   ""ELOPE"": Letters: E, L, O, P, E -> avoids C,R,A,N? And E in first and fifth? But we know E is not in fifth? \n   We are not sure about fifth? Actually, our feedback said E is present but not in fifth? \n   So the secret word has at least one E that is not in the fifth position. \n   It could have another E in the fifth? But we don\'t know.\n\n   However, we want to avoid the fifth position for E because we know that the fifth letter is not E? \n   Actually, the feedback tells us that the fifth letter was not E in the secret word? \n   Our guess ""crane"" had E at the fifth, and it was marked as \'-\' meaning E is in the word but not at that spot. \n   So the fifth letter of the secret word is not E. Therefore, we should avoid putting E in the fifth again? \n   But we can put it again? It doesn\'t matter because we are trying to learn more.\n\n   However, we already know E is not in fifth? So we should try E in a different position.\n\n   Let\'s choose a word with E not in fifth and without C,R,A,N.\n\n   Words with E in position 1: \n      ELBOW -> letters: E, L, B, O, W -> avoids A,C,R,N?\n      ELITE -> E, L, I, T, E -> but we use E twice? And avoids C,R,A,N? \n          However, note: we don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s? So it\'s okay.\n\n   But let\'s look for words with more common letters.\n\n   Another common letter is T, so I might want to include T.\n\n   Word with E in second position? \n      ""TEETH"" -> E in second and fourth? But T is used twice? \n      But avoids A,C,R,N? \n          Also, we don\'t know about T? \n\n   We haven\'t tested T yet? So we can use T.\n\n   Common starting words with E and avoiding C,R,A,N: \n      ""SLATE"" -> S,L,A,T,E? But A is eliminated -> invalid.\n      ""ROAST"" -> has R and A -> invalid.\n\n   How about ""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? But E is at the fourth position? And the fifth letter is L? \n\n   But note: we need words without A, R, N, C.\n\n   Another: ""BOWEL"": B,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? \n\n   But we also want to test more new letters.\n\n   Let\'s list available letters: we haven\'t used many.\n\n   We know E is present. We have used C,R,A,N,E (from first guess). \n\n   So available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\n   We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter in the secret word.\n\n   Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, S, T, L, O, I, ... but we already know E is there.\n\n   So include S, T, L, O.\n\n   How about a word that has E and S, T, L, O? Without using C,R,A,N.\n\n   Example: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        But note: ""STOLE"" has E at the end? We don\'t want to put E at the end? \n        Because we know the fifth letter is not E? \n        But we can use it to test other positions? \n\n        We are forced to put E somewhere? The feedback does not forbid E at the end? \n        We just know that it\'s not in the fifth position? So putting E at the end again would not help? \n        Because we already know E is present and not at the fifth? \n\n        However, the secret word might have E at more than one position? \n        We don\'t know. So by putting E at the end again, if the secret word has two E\'s? \n        Then we would get \'-\' for E again? \n\n        Alternatively, we might learn about other letters.\n\n   Since we have E present, we can try to place it in a different position to see where it goes.\n\n   Why not put E at the beginning? \n\n   Let me choose ""ELOPS"": but I\'m not sure if it\'s a valid word? \n\n   Alternatively, ""STOLE"" is valid? But E at the end is redundant? \n\n   Another word: ""HOMES"" -> H,O,M,E,S -> E is fourth? \n   Also, avoids A,C,R,N? \n\n   Or ""TIMES"": T,I,M,E,S -> E in fourth? \n\n   Or ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> E in fifth? We avoid fifth? \n\n   Let\'s avoid E in fifth? \n\n   How about ""TILES"": T,I,L,E,S -> E in fourth? \n   But that\'s one letter? \n\n   Another idea: ""FLUID"", but no E? We must include E? Or we don\'t have to? \n   Actually, we don\'t have to include E? But note: the feedback only tells us that E is in the word? \n   But we have not confirmed where? So including E in a different position might help locate it.\n\n   However, if we don\'t include E, we might not get information about E? But we already know E is present? \n   So we can choose words without E? That might help test other letters? \n\n   The rules say we can guess any valid word? But strategically, we want to find the word quickly.\n\n   Since we know E is present, and we don\'t know its position, we should try E in a different position? \n\n   So I think we should put E in one of positions 1 to 4.\n\n   Let me choose a word with E in the first position: \n      ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. \n      This way, if E is in the first position, we get a ✓ for E? Otherwise, if E is not in first, but in the word, we get a \'-\'? \n\n   Alternatively, we can put E in a more common position? \n\n   Common positions for E: not at the end? Then in the middle? \n\n   According to feedback, E was at fifth and that was wrong? So E must be in 1,2,3,4.\n\n   We can also try E in the second position? \n\n   Let me pick a word with E in the second position and common letters: \n      ""BELLY"": B,E,L,L,Y -> but double L? \n      ""TEETH"": double E? \n      ""BESTI"": no.\n\n   How about ""METAL""? But A is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   ""LEMON"": but L,E,M,O,N? We have N? N is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   ""PETOS"": not a word? \n\n   Let me think: without A and N, and with E in second? \n      ""HELIO"" is not 5 letters? \n      ""DEUCE"" but D,E,U,C,E? C is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   Words with E in the third position: \n      ""CRUES"" -> C is eliminated -> invalid?\n      ""SPIEL"": S,P,I,E,L -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        E is fourth? Wait: S P I E L -> third letter I, fourth E? \n        We want E in third? \n\n   Actually: \n      ""GRUEL"" -> G,R,U,E,L? R is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   ""SUEDE"": S,U,E,D,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. But E in third and fifth? \n        Fifth: we know E is not fifth? So we get \'-\' for third position? Or if the word has only one E? \n\n   This is getting messy.\n\n   Since we have eliminated only 4 letters (C,R,A,N) and have 22 left? \n\n   Let\'s choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible? And put E in a non-fifth position.\n\n   Example: ""SPIEL"" -> \n        letters: S, P, I, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n        E is in the fifth? Wait: \n            P-O-S-I-T-I-O-N: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E? Wait, it\'s S-P-I-E-L -> so E is fourth? \n            So E in fourth position? \n        Then fifth is L? \n        That\'s fine.\n\n   Or ""TOWED"": T,O,W,E,D -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fourth? \n\n   Or ""MOVIE"": M,O,V,I,E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fifth? We avoid? \n\n   So ""SPIEL"" sounds good: \n        S, P, I, E, L -> no duplicates? \n\n   We\'ll use that? \n\n   But note: we must be cautious: E is in fourth position? \n\n   What if the secret word has E in the first position? Then we would get S,P,I -> all absent? \n   And E as \'-\', L absent? That might not be informative? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a word that starts with E? \n\n   Let me look for a better word? \n\n   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E at the end? We avoid? \n\n   ""STOLE"": E at the end? We avoid? \n\n   But we can try ""STEEL""? But not 5 distinct letters? \n\n   How about ""KELP""? Not 5 letters? \n\n   I think ""QUEST"": Q,U,E,S,T -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in third? \n        But Q is uncommon? \n\n   Let me go with ""SPIEL"". \n\n   So we guess ""SPIEL""? \n\n   But note: we might get more information.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""E"", in the first position? \n\n   Let me decide: \n\n   Option 1: ""ELTCH"" (not a word) -> no.\n\n   Option 2: ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth? Avoid C,R,A,N? Yes. Letters: E,D,G,E,S -> duplicates E? \n        If we guess it, the duplicate E might be confusing? \n        But the feedback will show: \n            First E: ✓ or -? \n            Fourth E? If the word has only one E and in the first? Then we get E(✓) and then E(x) for fourth? \n            Or if it also has E elsewhere? \n\n   But we don\'t know? \n\n   How about ""STOLE""? Even though E is at the end? We know the fifth letter is not E. \n        But if we put E at the end again, then the feedback for E will be \'-\', meaning E is present but not at fifth? \n        But we already know that? And we might learn about the other positions? \n\n        Actually, we haven\'t tested the fifth letter? We only know it\'s not E? So we can test other letters? \n\n        So ""STOLE"" has E at fifth? And we know it\'s not E? So we expect a \'-\' for E? \n        But we will learn about S,T,O,L: \n            If any of them are in the word? \n\n        However, we are testing S,T,O,L? \n\n        Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" tests S,P,I,E,L? \n\n        Either is fine? \n\n   Considering that E is already known to be present? Maybe we can avoid including E? \n\n   Actually, we have 5 guesses left? And we don\'t lose much? \n\n   However, we want to cover common letters? \n\n   Common letters: S, T, L, O, I are common? \n\n   So ""STOLE"" tests S,T,O,L,E? \n   But E at fifth: we expect a \'-\'? \n   Then we would get: \n        S at position 1 -> (✓ or - or x)\n        T at 2 -> similarly\n        O at 3 -> similarly\n        L at 4 -> similarly\n        E at 5 -> will be \'-\' (as expected)\n\n   Since we know E is present? Then regardless of other letters? \n\n   But we are testing 5 letters? With E being known? \n\n   Alternatively, I found a word: ""STILE"" (a type of ladder)? S,T,I,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        Also, E is at fifth? And we avoid fifth? \n\n   But note: we haven\'t tried words with E not at fifth? \n\n   Given that we already know E is present and not at fifth, we might try to find E\'s position by putting it in an early position? \n\n   Let me choose a word that starts with E? \n\n   Example: ""ELAND""? Has A? A is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   ""EDGED""? Doubled E and D? \n\n   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n        E in first? \n        This tests E,I,G,H,T? \n\n   Also, ""INLET"": I,N,L,E,T -> has N? Eliminated? \n\n   ""EASEL""? has A and E doubled? \n\n   ""EVITE"": E,V,I,T,E -> avoid? \n\n   ""ETUDE"": E,T,U,D,E -> avoid duplicates? \n\n   ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\n        So ""EXIST"": E(1), X(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). \n        But T is at fifth? We don\'t know about T? \n\n   But note, we don\'t want to use fifth for E? But fifth here is T? \n\n   So ""EXIST"" has E at first? \n\n   I think ""EXIST"" or ""EIGHT""?\n\n   Commonality: S is more common than G and H? \n\n   So ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> it tests E at first? \n\n   We might get E(✓) if E is at first? \n\n   Otherwise, E(-) if E is elsewhere? \n\n   So let me choose a word like ""EXIST"".\n\n   We have to decide.\n\n   Given the above, I will choose ""EXIST"". \n\n   So our second guess: ""EXIST""\n\n   But let me see: \n        We avoid C,R,A,N? Yes: E,X,I,S,T doesn\'t have any of C,R,A,N.\n\n   So guess ""EXIST"".\n\n   Alternatively, if we want to avoid X? because X is rare? \n\n   Then ""MIDST"" -> M,I,D,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        But doesn\'t include E? Then we don\'t test E? \n        But we know E is present? So by not including E, we might get no feedback for E? \n        And then we don\'t learn about the position? \n        However, we will learn about these letters? \n\n        But if the word has E, and E is in ""MIDST"", we would not learn its position? \n\n        Actually, the feedback will still be: \n            If M is not in word -> x\n            I -> if in word and in position: ✓ or -? \n            D -> same\n            S -> same\n            T -> same\n\n        And if E is in the word? It doesn\'t come up? \n\n        So we don\'t get info on E? \n\n        That\'s bad because we know E is present? \n\n        We should include E? \n\n   Therefore, we must include E? \n\n   So I go with ""EXIST"" or ""SPIEL""? \n\n   After consideration, let me choose ""SPIEL"": \n        Reason: It includes E (but not fifth? fourth instead) and avoids C,R,A,N? \n        Also, letters S,P,I,E,L -> common letters? \n\n   We\'ll guess ""SPIEL"".\n\n   But note: position of E? In ""SPIEL"" the positions are: \n        1: S\n        2: P\n        3: I\n        4: E\n        5: L\n\n   So we are testing E in fourth? \n\n   If the secret word has E in fourth? We get ✓ for E? \n   Otherwise, if it has E elsewhere? Then \'-\' for E? \n\n   But let\'s hope we get some other hits? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word with E in the first? \n\n   Since we don\'t know? But time is short? \n\n   Another common word: ""POUND"" -> skip because we don\'t have E? \n\n   We must include E? \n\n   So ""QUEUE"" is not helpful? \n\n   Final: Guess ""SPIEL""\n\n   Or ""E"", first: ""ENTRY"" -> has N? and R? -> invalid.\n\n   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        And E in first? \n\n   I think ""EIGHT"" is a good word? \n\n   So I\'ll choose ""EIGHT""\n\n   Why? It tests E at position 1? And I,G,H,T? \n\n   We haven\'t tested G,H,T,I? \n\n   Common letters: I, T, H are common? \n\n   Let\'s do ""EIGHT""\n\n   So guess: ""EIGHT""\n\n   Second guess: ""eight""\n\n   But note: E is at first? \n\n   We expect if E is first, ✓. If not, then \'-\' because we know E is present? \n\n   But what if the secret word has no E at the first? Then we get \'-\' and we know E is in the word? \n\n   So this is acceptable.\n\n   We proceed with ""EIGHT"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked as ""x"").\n- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked as ""-"").\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word contains the letter E, located in positions 1–4.\n- The letters C, R, A, and N must be excluded from all subsequent guesses.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- We need to include E in a different position (anywhere except the 5th) to help identify its correct location.\n- Letters like T, I, G, and H are strong choices because they are common in English words and haven\'t been tested yet.\n- ""EIGHT"" aligns with these criteria: \n  - E is placed in position 1 (testing if E appears there).\n  - T, I, G, and H are new letters that maximize information gain.\n  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of E and test four additional common letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>eight</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning:\n  C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.\n  E is present but not in the 5th position.\n\nGuess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)\nMeaning:\n  E is present but not in the 1st position (since we guessed it in the first position and got \'-\'). \n  I is present and in the correct position (2nd position, because in ""eight"", I is the second letter).\n  G, H, T are absent.\n\nSo from both guesses, we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T\nPresent letters: E (but not in 1st or 5th position) and I (which is in the 2nd position).\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n  - The second letter is I.\n  - The letter E is present, but not in the 1st, 2nd (because second is I), or 5th position. So E must be in the 3rd or 4th position.\n\nWe also know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.\n\nWe have 4 tries left.\n\nNow, we need to form a new guess that:\n  - Has 5 letters, all from the remaining possible letters (excluding absent ones).\n  - Must have I in the second position.\n  - Must include E in either the 3rd or 4th position (to check which one).\n  - Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.\n\nAvailable letters: \n  We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, G, H, T (from the two guesses). \n  But note: E and I are present, so they are still in play (but we know I is fixed at position 2).\n\n  The alphabet without the absent letters: \n    B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\n  And we know E must be included (but not in 1st, 2nd, or 5th) and I is fixed at position 2.\n\nSo the secret word pattern is: \n  Position 1: one of B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but not E, because E is not in 1st)\n  Position 2: I (fixed)\n  Position 3: either E or one of the available letters? But note: E must be in the word, and it can only be in 3rd or 4th. So either position 3 or 4 must be E.\n  Position 4: similarly, if E is not in 3rd, then it must be in 4th.\n  Position 5: one of the available letters (but not E, because E is not in 5th).\n\nWe can try to form a word that has I in the second position and E in the third position? Or in the fourth?\n\nWe should also try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s consider the possibilities:\n\nOption 1: Assume E is in the 3rd position -> pattern: _ I E _ _\nOption 2: Assume E is in the 4th position -> pattern: _ I _ E _\n\nWe don\'t know which, so we can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has E in the 3rd position and then if it\'s not there, we know it must be in the 4th? \n\nBut we can also choose a word that doesn\'t have E at all? But we must include E because we know it\'s present? \n\nWait, we must include E? Actually, we don\'t have to? But if we don\'t include E, then we won\'t get information about E\'s position? \n\nBut we know E is present? So if we don\'t include E, we will get all the other letters\' feedback, but we won\'t learn about E? \n\nHowever, we can still get the feedback for the letters we do include? \n\nBut we have limited guesses? So it\'s better to include E to try to locate it? \n\nSo let\'s include E in either the 3rd or 4th position? \n\nWe can choose a word that has E in the 3rd position? \n\nFor example: \n  Pattern: _ I E _ _\n\nWe need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with available letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B,D,F,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nWe want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nCommon letters: S, L, O, P, D, etc.\n\nExample words: \n  ""SIEVE"" -> S I E V E -> but E is in 3rd and 5th? But we cannot have E in 5th? \n      Also, V is present? \n      But note: we are going to put E in 3rd? and 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? So we cannot use E in 5th? \n      So ""SIEVE"" is invalid because it has E in 5th? \n\n  ""SIEVE"" is not allowed? Because we know E is not in 5th? So we must avoid E in 5th? \n\n  ""DIET_"" -> but we need 5 letters? ""DIETS"" -> D I E T S -> but T is absent? T is eliminated? \n\n  ""LIEU_"" -> ""LIEUS"" (a word? meaning a unit of the French currency) -> L I E U S -> avoids absent letters? \n        Letters: L, I, E, U, S -> all allowed? \n        But E is in 3rd? \n        And no E in 5th? \n\n  ""BIELD"" (Scottish word for shelter) -> B I E L D -> avoids absent letters? \n        B, I, E, L, D -> all allowed? \n\n  ""PIECE"" -> P I E C E -> but C is absent? \n\n  ""FIELD"" -> F I E L D -> avoids absent letters? \n        F, I, E, L, D -> all allowed? \n\n  ""WIELD"" -> W I E L D -> same.\n\n  ""PIEZO"" -> P I E Z O -> avoids absent? \n\nBut note: we are not sure if these words are in the word list? \n\nAlternatively, we can try E in the 4th position? \n\nPattern: _ I _ E _\n\nExample: \n  ""SIRED"" -> S I R E D -> but R is absent? \n  ""FILED"" -> F I L E D -> avoids absent? \n        F, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? \n\n  ""MILER"" -> M I L E R -> R absent? \n  ""BIDES"" -> B I D E S -> avoids absent? \n\n  ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S -> avoids absent? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nWe can choose either pattern? \n\nBut we want to maximize information? \n\nWe know that E is either in 3rd or 4th? So if we choose a word with E in 3rd, we can test that hypothesis? \n\nIf we get E(✓) in 3rd, then we know E is in 3rd? \nIf we get E(-) in 3rd, then E is not in 3rd? So it must be in 4th? \n\nSimilarly, if we put E in 4th? \n\nSo either way, we can get the position? \n\nBut we also want to test other letters? \n\nSo let\'s choose a word that has E in 3rd and has common letters? \n\nI\'ll go with ""FIELD"": F I E L D -> \n  F: new letter\n  I: already known to be in second? so we expect ✓ for I? \n  E: in 3rd? we test if E is in 3rd? \n  L: new letter? \n  D: new letter? \n\nBut note: we are using F, L, D? \n\nAlternatively, ""WIELD"": W I E L D -> same? \n\nBut ""FIELD"" is more common? \n\nHowever, we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut we haven\'t seen any repeated letters so far? \n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has E in 3rd and also includes other common letters? \n\nBut we have limited letters? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has E in 4th? \n\nBut let\'s stick with E in 3rd? \n\nI choose ""FIELD"". \n\nBut wait: what if the secret word is ""FIELD""? Then we win? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nBut let\'s see: \n  If we guess ""FIELD"", and the secret word has E in 3rd? Then we get:\n      F: ? \n      I: ✓ (because second is I)\n      E: ✓ (if E is in 3rd) \n      L: ? \n      D: ?\n\n  If the secret word is ""FIELD"", then we get all ✓? \n\n  But if not, we get feedback on F, L, D? \n\n  Also, if E is not in 3rd, then we get E(-) meaning E is present but not in 3rd? Then we know E must be in 4th? \n\nSo it\'s a good test? \n\nBut note: we are using F, L, D? \n\nWe could use more common letters? \n\nCommon letters: S, O, L, D, etc. \n\nHow about ""SILED""? Not a common word? \n\n""OILED"": O I L E D -> avoids absent? \n        O, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? \n        But E is in 4th? \n\nBut we are testing E in 4th? \n\nWe can do that? \n\nBut we don\'t know if E is in 3rd or 4th? \n\nSo if we choose ""OILED"", we are testing E in 4th? \n\nIf we get E(✓) in 4th, then we know E is in 4th? \nIf we get E(-) in 4th, then E is not in 4th? So it must be in 3rd? \n\nSo both ""FIELD"" (E in 3rd) and ""OILED"" (E in 4th) are valid? \n\nBut we can only choose one? \n\nI think we should choose one that uses more common letters? \n\n""OILED"" has O, L, D? \n\n""FIELD"" has F, L, D? \n\nO is more common than F? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nAnother word: ""SIDLE"": S I D L E -> but E is in 5th? Not allowed? \n\n""QUIET"": Q U I E T -> T is absent? \n\n""JUICY"": J U I C Y -> C absent? \n\n""PILED"": P I L E D -> avoids absent? \n        P, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? \n        E in 4th? \n\n""PILED"" is a word? \n\nSimilarly, ""WIPED"": W I P E D -> avoids absent? \n\nBut we have to avoid T? \n\nI think ""PILED"" is a good choice? \n\nBut let me compare:\n\n  ""FIELD"": tests E in 3rd, and letters F, L, D? \n  ""PILED"": tests E in 4th, and letters P, L, D? \n\nWe already know I is in second? \n\nIn ""PILED"", the I is in second? So we expect I(✓). \n\nWe can choose either? \n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested S? S is a very common letter? \n\nSo maybe we should include S? \n\nPattern for E in 3rd: _ I E _ _ \n  With S: \n      Position 1: S -> ""SIE??"" \n      We need two more letters? \n      Example: ""SIEVE"" -> invalid because of E at the end? \n      ""SIEGE"" -> S I E G E -> but G is absent? \n      ""SIECE"" -> not a word? \n      ""SIELD"" -> not a word? \n      ""SIEUR"" -> S I E U R -> R is absent? \n\nPattern for E in 4th: _ I _ E _ \n  With S: \n      ""S I ? E ?"" \n      Example: ""SIRED"" -> R absent? \n      ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S -> avoids absent? \n          D is allowed? \n          But note: S is used twice? \n          Also, E is in 4th? \n          And fifth is S? \n          So ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S? \n          But we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates? \n\n      ""SINES"" -> S I N E S -> N is absent? \n      ""SILES"" -> not a word? \n      ""SITES"" -> T is absent? \n      ""SIVES"" -> not common? \n\n  ""SIXES"" -> S I X E S -> avoids absent? \n        But X is allowed? \n        And S is duplicated? \n\n  ""SIZES"" -> S I Z E S -> avoids absent? \n\nBut we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? \n\nThe rules don\'t say? But in Wordle, duplicates are allowed? \n\nBut in our feedback, we haven\'t seen any duplicates? \n\nBut the secret word might have duplicates? \n\nHowever, to be safe, we can avoid duplicates? \n\nSo ""SIDES"" is a word? And it has two S\'s? \n\nBut we are testing S in first and fifth? \n\nIf the secret word has only one S? Then we might get S(✓) and S(x) for the fifth? \n\nBut it\'s acceptable? \n\nBut we are not sure? \n\nAlternatively, without duplicates: \n\n  ""SIXES"" has two S\'s? \n\n  ""SIXTH"" -> T and H absent? \n\n  ""SIXTY"" -> T absent? \n\n  ""SILED"" -> S I L E D -> avoids absent? \n        S, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? \n        E in 4th? \n\n  ""SILED"" is a word? (past tense of sile: to descend, as a hawk) \n\n  But not common? \n\n  ""SIPED"" -> not a word? \n\n  ""SIMES"" -> not a word? \n\n  ""SIBYL"" -> S I B Y L -> avoids absent? \n        But no E? We must include E? \n\n  We must include E? \n\n  So ""SILED"" is acceptable? \n\n  But we are testing E in 4th? \n\n  Similarly, we can do ""SIDED"" -> but D repeated? \n\n  ""SIDED"" has two D\'s? \n\n  ""SIDLE"" -> S I D L E -> E in fifth? Not allowed? \n\nSo I think ""SILED"" is acceptable? \n\nBut to use common words, I\'ll avoid ""SILED"". \n\nAnother common word: ""DOILY"" -> no E? \n\nWe must include E? \n\nSo I think ""PILED"" is a common word? \n\nI\'ll go with ""PILED"": \n  P I L E D \n  This tests:\n      P in first? \n      I in second: ✓ (we know)\n      L in third? \n      E in fourth? \n      D in fifth? \n\n  If E is in fourth, we get E(✓) and then we know the position? \n  If E is not in fourth, we get E(-) meaning E is present but not in fourth? Then we know E must be in third? \n\n  Also, we test P, L, D? \n\n  So we get information on three new letters? \n\n  And we avoid the absent letters? \n\n  So I choose ""PILED"". \n\nBut note: we are testing E in the fourth position? \n\nAlternatively, we can test E in the third? \n\nBut we have to choose one? \n\nI think it\'s symmetric? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""PILED"". \n\nGuess: ""PILED""\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  We have not used P, L, D before? \n  And we avoid C,R,A,N,G,H,T? \n\nYes.\n\nSo <guess>piled</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A, N are absent (x), E is present but not in the 5th position (-).\n- **Guess 2: ""eight""** → E is present but not in the 1st position (-), I is correct and in the 2nd position (✓), and G, H, T are absent (x).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **I is fixed in the 2nd position** of the secret word.\n2. **E is present** but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since position 2 is I, and E was misplaced in positions 1 and 5). Thus, E must be in **position 3 or 4**.\n3. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T (cannot be used).\n4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test **E in the 4th position** to narrow down its location (if E is not in the 4th, it must be in the 3rd).\n- Include **new common letters** (P, L, D) to maximize information.\n- Use a valid word that fits the pattern `_ I _ E _` and avoids absent letters.\n\nThe word **""PILED""** is chosen because:\n- It places I in the 2nd position (✓, as required).\n- It tests E in the 4th position (if E is here, it will be ✓; if not, E must be in the 3rd).\n- It introduces three new common letters (P, L, D) to check for presence/position.\n- It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, N, G, H, T).\n\n<guess>piled</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: piled -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) L(-) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n  Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent.

G, H, T are absent.\n\nGuess 3: ""piled"" -> P(x), I(✓), L(-), E(✓), D(x)\n  Meaning: P is absent. I is correct in the 2nd position (again). L is present but not in the 3rd position. E is present and in the correct position (4th). D is absent.\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate the information:\n\n1. Correctly positioned letters:\n   - I is in the 2nd position.\n   - E is in the 4th position.\n\n   So the secret word has the form: _ I _ E _\n\n2. Present letters but not in the guessed positions:\n   - E was previously marked as present but not in 1st (from guess2) and not in 5th (from guess1). Now we know it is in 4th (from guess3).\n   - L is present but not in the 3rd position (from guess3). Since the 4th position is E, L must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th? But wait, the word is _ I _ E _, so positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know:\n        Position 2: I\n        Position 4: E\n        So L is present and not in 3rd, so it must be in position 1 or 5? But note: we have only 5 positions.\n\n   However, we must consider that L could be in position 1 or 5? But we don\'t have a 5th position for L? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 5 are open? But we know position 3 was guessed as L in ""piled"" and it was marked as \'-\', meaning L is not in position 3. So L must be in position 1 or 5.\n\n3. Absent letters:\n   From all guesses: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D are absent.\n\n   So absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D.\n\n4. Present letters (including those correctly placed and misplaced):\n   - E (in position 4)\n   - I (in position 2)\n   - L (present, but not in position 3, so must be in 1 or 5)\n\n   Also, from guess1, we know E is present (and now we know it\'s in 4th). From guess2, I is present (in 2nd). From guess3, L is present (but not in 3rd).\n\n   So the secret word contains at least: I, E, L.\n\n   And we have two positions to fill: 1, 3, and 5? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 5 are unknown, but we know one of position 1 or 5 must be L? And the other two must be filled with letters that are not absent and not already known? \n\n   But note: the word has 5 letters. We have:\n        Position 1: ? (could be L or a new letter)\n        Position 2: I\n        Position 3: ? \n        Position 4: E\n        Position 5: ? \n\n   And we know L is present and not in 3, so it must be in 1 or 5.\n\n   Therefore, the word has L in either position 1 or 5, and the remaining two positions (if L is in 1, then positions 3 and 5; if L is in 5, then positions 1 and 3) must be filled with letters that are not absent and not I or E (which are already placed).\n\n   But note: the word might have more than one L? The feedback doesn\'t indicate that. In guess3, we had only one L (in position 3) and it was marked as \'-\', meaning that L is present but not there. It doesn\'t say anything about other L\'s? So it\'s possible that L appears again? But we don\'t know.\n\n   However, to be safe, we should consider that L might be only once? Or it might be twice? \n\n   But since we have limited information, we can assume for now that L appears only once? \n\n   Actually, the feedback for ""piled"" had only one L and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if there were two L\'s, we might have gotten two marks? But in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will mark each occurrence appropriately? \n\n   For example, if the word has two L\'s and we guess one in the correct position and one in the wrong, we would get one ✓ and one -? But in this case, we only have one L in the guess and it was marked as \'-\', meaning that there is at least one L that is not in that position. It doesn\'t rule out the possibility of another L? \n\n   However, we don\'t have evidence of a second L? So we can proceed with the assumption that there is only one L? \n\n   Therefore, L must be in position 1 or 5.\n\n5. Available letters: \n   We have used: C,R,A,N,E,I,G,H,T,P,L,D (from the three guesses). \n   Absent: C,R,A,N,G,H,T,P,D -> so these cannot be used.\n   Present: E, I, L (and we know E and I are fixed, L is to be placed).\n\n   The remaining letters (not absent and not yet placed) are: \n        B, F, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\n   But note: we have to fill the positions 1, 3, 5, but one of them is L (if L is only once). \n\n   So the word must have L in either 1 or 5, and the other two positions from the available letters.\n\n   Also, the letter in position 3 must be one of the available letters (and not L, because if L is only once and we place it in 1 or 5, then position 3 cannot be L).\n\nNow, we need to form a guess that helps us determine:\n   - Where L is (position 1 or 5)?\n   - What are the letters in the remaining positions?\n\nBut note: we have two unknowns (if we consider L\'s position) and three positions? Actually, we have:\n\nCase 1: L in position 1 -> then the word is: L I ? E ? \n   Then positions 3 and 5 must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set (B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) and not L.\n\nCase 2: L in position 5 -> then the word is: ? I ? E L\n   Then positions 1 and 3 must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set.\n\nWe can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one word.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position 1 and then we see? Or in position 5? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nWe can also choose a word that doesn\'t include L? But we know L is present? So if we don\'t include L, we will get an \'x\' for L? But we know L is present? So that would be a waste? \n\nTherefore, we must include L? \n\nBut we don\'t know if L is in 1 or 5? \n\nSo we have to choose one? \n\nWe can choose a word that has L in position 1? Then if L is in 1, we get ✓ for L? If not, we get \'-\' meaning L is present but not in 1? Then we know L must be in 5? \n\nSimilarly, if we put L in 5, then if we get ✓ for L, it\'s in 5? If we get \'-\', then L is in 1? \n\nSo either way, we can determine L\'s position? \n\nBut we also want to test the other letters? \n\nSo let\'s choose a word that has L in position 1? \n\nThen the pattern: L I ? E ? \n\nWe need to fill positions 3 and 5 with available letters? \n\nWe want to use common letters? \n\nFor example: \n   Position 3: S (common)\n   Position 5: O (common) -> ""L I S E O"" -> not a word? \n\n   ""L I V E S"" -> but that\'s 5 letters? ""LIVES"" -> but V is available? \n\n   ""L I V E S"" is 5 letters: L, I, V, E, S -> but we have E in 4th? So ""L I V E S"" -> positions: \n        1: L\n        2: I\n        3: V\n        4: E\n        5: S\n\n   But the secret word has E in 4th? So that matches? \n\n   And ""LIVES"" is a word? \n\n   But note: we have to avoid absent letters? V and S are not in the absent list? \n\n   So ""LIVES"" is a candidate? \n\n   But what if the secret word is ""LIVES""? Then we win? \n\n   But we don\'t know? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common letters? \n\n   Another: ""L I K E S"" -> ""LIKES"" -> K is available? \n\n   ""LIKES"": L I K E S -> avoids absent? \n\n   But note: we are testing L in 1? \n\n   If L is not in 1, then we get L marked as \'-\'? meaning L is present but not in 1? Then we know L is in 5? \n\n   And we also test K and S? \n\n   So that\'s good? \n\n   But we have to consider that the secret word might have K? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in 5? \n\n   For example: "" ? I ? E L"" \n\n   Example: ""O I L E L"" -> but duplicate L? and O in first? \n\n   ""O I L E L"" is not a word? \n\n   ""S I Z E L"" -> S I Z E L -> ""SIZEL"" is not a word? \n\n   ""M I L E L"" -> not a word? \n\n   ""B I T E L"" -> not a word? \n\n   ""W I S E L"" -> not a word? \n\n   ""F I L E L"" -> not a word? \n\n   ""A I S L E"" -> but A is absent? \n\n   ""J I V E L"" -> ""JIVEL"" not a word? \n\n   ""V I E L L"" -> duplicate L? \n\n   It seems hard to find a word ending with ""IEL"" with E in the fourth? \n\n   Actually, the word is _ I _ E L -> so the last two letters are E and L? \n\n   Example: ""T I E L E"" -> but T is absent? \n\n   ""D I M E L"" -> D is absent? \n\n   ""B I K E L"" -> ""BIKEL"" not a word? \n\n   ""S I B E L"" -> ""SIBEL"" not common? \n\n   ""N I B E L"" -> N absent? \n\n   So it might be difficult to find a common word with L in the 5th? \n\n   Therefore, it might be more promising to assume L is in the 1st? \n\n   And we have words like ""LIVES"", ""LIKES"", etc. \n\n   But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? \n\n   Let me list words that fit the pattern for L in 1st: L I ? E ? \n\n   We have to fill the 3rd and 5th with letters from: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\n   Common words:\n      ""L I F E S"" -> ""LIFES"" not a word? \n      ""L I V E S"" -> ""LIVES"" (valid)\n      ""L I K E S"" -> ""LIKES"" (valid)\n      ""L I M E S"" -> ""LIMES"" (valid)\n      ""L I N E S"" -> but N is absent? \n      ""L I P E S"" -> P absent? \n      ""L I B E L"" -> ""LIBEL"" (valid) but note: L in first and fifth? \n          If we use ""LIBEL"", then we have L in first and fifth? \n          But we don\'t know if the word allows two L\'s? \n          And we have to consider: if the secret word has two L\'s? \n          In our feedback, we only know that there is at least one L (from guess3). \n          So ""LIBEL"" is a possibility? \n\n   But if we guess ""LIBEL"", then:\n        Position 1: L -> if L is in 1st, then ✓? \n        Position 2: I -> ✓\n        Position 3: B -> ?\n        Position 4: E -> ✓\n        Position 5: L -> if the secret word has L in 5th, then ✓? But if the secret word has only one L (in 1st), then we get L in 5th marked as absent? \n\n   But we don\'t know? \n\n   However, if the secret word has only one L (in 1st), then we would get:\n        L(✓) for first, and L(x) for fifth? \n        But we know L is present? So if we get L(x) for fifth, that means the fifth letter is not L? \n\n   But if the secret word has two L\'s, then we might get both? \n\n   But we don\'t have evidence of two L\'s? \n\n   So to avoid complexity, we can choose a word without duplicate L? \n\n   Therefore, ""LIVES"", ""LIKES"", ""LIMES"" are good? \n\n   Now, which one? \n\n   We want to test as many new letters as possible? \n\n   ""LIVES"": uses V and S? \n   ""LIKES"": uses K and S? \n   ""LIMES"": uses M and S? \n\n   V, K, M are all not tested? \n\n   We can choose one? \n\n   Since S is common, we can test S in the fifth? \n\n   But we don\'t know if S is in the word? \n\n   So I\'ll choose ""LIKES"" because K is less common? Or ""LIVES"" because V is less common? \n\n   Actually, we want to maximize the chance of hitting? \n\n   Common letters: S is more common than V, K, M? \n\n   So ""LIMES"" has M and S? \n\n   But we can also choose a word that has S in a different position? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose ""S"" in a position that might be in the secret word? \n\n   But we don\'t know? \n\n   I think ""LIVES"" is a good choice? \n\n   But note: we are also testing L in the first? \n\n   So I\'ll go with ""LIVES"". \n\n   Guess: ""LIVES""\n\n   If the secret word is ""LIVES"", we win? \n\n   If not, we get feedback on V and S? \n\n   And also, if L is not in first, we get L marked as \'-\'? \n\n   But we expect L to be in first? \n\n   Alternatively, if we get L marked as \'-\', then we know L is in fifth? \n\n   So we can then focus on words ending with L? \n\n   So it\'s a good test? \n\n   Therefore, we guess ""LIVES"". \n\nBut wait: what if the secret word has only one L and it is in the fifth? Then in ""LIVES"", we have L in first? \n   We would get: \n        L in first: marked as \'-\' (because L is present but not in first? and we know it must be in fifth? but we don\'t have L in fifth in the guess? so we get L marked as present but not in first? and then we know it must be in fifth? \n   And then we also get feedback on V and S? \n\n   So we can then make a next guess with L in fifth? \n\n   So it\'s acceptable? \n\n   We have 3 guesses left? \n\n   So I think it\'s a good move. \n\n   Let me count the guesses: we are about to make the 4th guess? \n\n   We have 3 guesses left? \n\n   So we can do it. \n\n   Therefore, we guess ""LIVES"". \n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters?

We have the feedback from guess4: ""lives"" -> L(✓), I(✓), V(x), E(✓), S(x)

This means:
- L is correct and in the first position. So position 1 is L.
- I is correct in the second position (already known).
- V is absent (x) from the secret word.
- E is correct in the fourth position (already known).
- S is absent (x) from the secret word.

Now, combining all feedback:

1. Correctly placed letters:
   - Position 1: L
   - Position 2: I
   - Position 4: E

   So the secret word is: L I _ E _

2. Absent letters:
   From all guesses: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D, V, S are absent.
   So absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D, V, S.

3. Present letters:
   We have L, I, E (all placed). 
   Additionally, from guess3: L was present (now placed at position1), and no other letters were indicated as present besides E (placed) and I (placed).
   From guess4: V and S are absent.

   But note: we might have missed other letters? Since we only have one unplaced position (position 3 and 5) and we don't have any other present letters indicated.

   However, we know that the secret word must be 5 letters, and we have L, I, and E placed. So we are missing letters for positions 3 and 5.

   We don't have any known present letter left? Because in guess3, we only had L marked as present (but not placed then) and now it's placed. In other guesses, no other present letters.

   Therefore, the remaining two letters (position 3 and 5) must come from the available letters.

4. Available letters (not absent and not used yet?):
   We have excluded: C,R,A,N,G,H,T,P,D,V,S. So available: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z.

   Since there are no known present letters left unplaced, the secret word's letters are L, I, E, and two letters from the available set.

   The word pattern: L I ? E ?

   We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""LI"", ends with ""E"", and the third and fifth letters are from B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z? But note: the fifth letter is after E? So the pattern is: L I ? E ? -> so fifth letter can be any available letter.

   Actually, position 4 is E, so positions 3 and 5 are the unknowns.

   We must fill position 3 and position 5 with any two distinct letters from the available set? Unless the word has double letters? But we don't know.

   However, we haven't seen any double letters so far? 

5. Constraints from feedback:
   In guess3: ""piled"" had L in position 3? and it was marked as '-'? But now we know L is in position 1? So that was consistent? And E was correctly placed at 4? Also, we had P and D absent.

   In guess4: ""lives"" had V in position 3 and S in position 5? and they were absent? So we know the secret word's position 3 is not V? and position 5 is not S? 

   But V and S are now absent? So excluded.

   We have 3 guesses left? 

   We need to guess a word that matches: 
        Position 1: L
        Position 2: I
        Position 3: ? (from available: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z)
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: ? (from available: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z)

   And it must be a valid English word? 

   We can try to think of words fitting ""LI_E_""

   Examples:
      ""LIKED"" -> but D is absent? 
      ""LITER"" -> T is absent? 
      ""LIBEL"" -> but we already know L is in first? and here L is also at last? but in ""lives"" we tested S? now we test B? 
          However, we don't know about B? 
          But pattern: ""LI_B E"" -> no? ""LIBEL"" is L I B E L -> so position 3 is B, position 5 is L? 
          But can we have two L's? It's possible? 
          Also, D is absent? 

      ""LIBEL"": L I B E L -> 
          Letters: L (twice), I, B, E.
          Absent letters: D? but B is not absent? 
          But we have absent: D is absent? but ""LIBEL"" doesn't have D? 
          So we can consider? 

      But in guess4, we tested V and S? That doesn't conflict? 

      However, we have two L's? In the secret word? 
      But we never tested a word with two L's? 

      Is it possible? 

      How would feedback work? 
      In ""piled"": we had only one L? and it was marked present but wrong position? 
      If the secret word had two L's? Then that L could be one of them? 
      But we don't know? 

      Now, we have the word ""LIBEL"": 
          Positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L.

      We don't know if L can be in position 5? 

      Alternatively, words without double L? 
        ""LIKE_"" -> but K is available? ""LIKE"" is 4 letters? 
        ""LIMEY"" -> L I M E Y -> avoids absent? 
           Position 3: M, Position 5: Y? 
        ""LINER"" -> N is absent? 
        ""LIBER"" -> B? but R absent? 
        ""LIMED"" -> D absent? 
        ""LIFER"" -> R absent? 

      ""LIMEY"": L I M E Y -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:M, 4:E, 5:Y.

      ""LIMBO"": L I M B O -> but pattern is LI_ E _? no, it doesn't have E in the fourth? unless ""LIMB O""? But ""LIMBO"" has E? No, it's L,I,M,B,O -> no E? 

      We need E in the fourth? So the word must end with E? only if there's a fifth letter? 

      Actually, the word is L I ? E ? -> so the last letter is the fifth? 

      So words: 
        ""L I ? E ?"" -> four letters in between? 

      We can list: 
        ""LIBER"" -> not, R absent? 
        ""LICET"" -> not a word? 

      ""LISLE"" -> but S is absent? 

      ""LITRE"" -> T absent? 

      So let's think: 
        ""LI E_"" ... no.

      The fourth letter is E? So after E, one letter? 

      Words like: 
        ""L I F E X"" -> ""LIFEX"" not a word? 
        ""L I F E B"" -> not a word? 
        ""L I B E X"" -> ""LIBEX"" not word? 
        ""L I B E L"" -> ""LIBEL"" (valid)

      ""L I V E S"" -> we tried ""LIVES"", but V and S absent? 

      ""L I K E S"" -> ""LIKES"": K is available? but S absent? 

      ""L I M E S"" -> ""LIMES"": M and S? S is absent? 

      ""L I M E ?"" -> without S? 
          ""LIMEY"" -> L I M E Y -> valid (meaning: a British person)

      So ""LIMEY"" is a valid word? 

      Also, ""LITRE"" is invalid because T absent? 

      ""LIBER"" invalid? 

      ""LIEGE"" -> L I E G E? But pattern: position 1:L,2:I,3:E? Oh, we need E at position 4? In ""LIEGE"", the E is in position 3 and 5? So not? 

      ""LIBER"" -> L I B E R -> then E is at position 4? and fifth is R? But R is absent? 

      So available words: 
         ""LIBEL"": L I B E L -> B at position 3? and L at 5? 
         ""LICE?"" -> no? 
         ""LIMEY"": L I M E Y -> M at 3, Y at 5? 
         ""LIFEY"" -> not a word? 
         ""LINEY"" -> N absent? 
         ""LIKEN"" -> N absent? 
         ""LIKED"" -> L I K E D -> D absent? 
         ""LIKE "" -> incomplete?

      Also, ""LIPES"" -> P and S absent? 

      And ""LIBER"" -> R absent? 

      So the only common words seem to be ""LIBEL"" and ""LIMEY"". 

      Since we have V and S absent, we can now use the available letters? 

      We can also try ""LIEVE"" -> not a standard word? 

      But we'll consider ""LIBEL"" and ""LIMEY"". 

      We have to choose one? 

      Let's see which gives more information? 

      ""LIBEL"": 
        - Tests B: in position 3? 
        - And tests L in position 5? (we already know L is present? 
        But if the secret word has L only once (in position 1), then position 5 L will be marked as absent? 
        Else if twice? then ✓? 

      ""LIMEY"": 
        - Tests M: in position 3? 
        - Tests Y: in position 5? 

      Since we haven't tested B, M, Y, etc., either is good? 

      But ""LIMEY"" has the advantage of using two new letters? 

      But we have one guess? Wait, we have 2 more guesses? 

      Actually, we have 4 guesses so far? and 6 total? So 2 left? 

      We can choose ""LIMEY"". 

      Also, consider: the secret word might not have two L's? So if we have ""LIMEY"", we avoid duplication? 

      Therefore, I choose ""LIMEY"". 

      Guess: ""limey""

   But wait: let's check feedback for ""limey""? 
      It has L in first (which is correct?), I second? M in third? E fourth? Y fifth? 

      So positions: 
        1: L -> should be ✓
        2: I -> ✓
        3: M -> if M in the word? if at third? ✓? 
        4: E -> ✓
        5: Y -> ?

      If the secret word is ""LIMEY"", all ✓. 
      If not, we get feedback on M and Y? 

      So we can then guess correctly in the last guess? 

      Therefore, we guess ""LIMEY"". 

   If there are other words? We might consider ""J"" or ""Q"", but not common? 

   But ""LIBEL"" is also a word? 

   Given two choices, we can also note that ""Y"" is a less common letter? 

   But I think ""LIMEY"" is acceptable? 

   Alternatively, ""LIKEN"" -> but N absent? 

   So final: guess ""LIMEY"" if it's in the word list? 

   We'll assume it is? 

   If not, we can pick ""LIBEL""? But let me see which is more common? 

   ""LIBEL"" is more common? But ""LIMEY"" is also an English word? 

   To be safe, we can try ""LIBEL""? 

   But note: in our available letters, we have not tested B? 

   But we are running out of guesses? We can only test one? 

   Given that we have 2 guesses left? 

   We can try ""LIBEL"" and if it doesn't work? Then we know? 

   But the secret word must be ""LIBEL"" or ""LIMEY""? 

   Wait, not necessarily? There might be other words? 

   Like: 
        L I F E R -> but R absent? 
        L I Z E R -> Z and R? 
        L I Z E ? -> ""LIZER"" not word? 

        L I B E M -> ""LIBEM"" not word? 

        L I M E D -> D absent? 

        L I K E S -> S absent? 

        L I M E S -> S absent? 

        L I M E B -> ""LIMEB"" not word? 

        L I M E C -> C absent? 

        L I K E N -> N absent? 

        L I B E S -> S absent? 

      ""L I F E "" ... 

      So perhaps ""LIBEL"" and ""LIMEY"" are the only ones? 

      Another: ""LINEN"" -> N absent? 

      ""LIKE?"" -> 

      ""LIRE?"" -> R absent? 

      So we have ""LIBEL"" and ""LIMEY""? 

      Also, ""LITH?"" -> no? 

      ""LIVID"" -> V absent? 

      So really, only two? 

      So we can try one? 

      We'll try ""LIMEY"". 

      Guess: ""limey""

   But note: the game rules: valid English words? 

   ""LIMEY"" is in the dictionary? 

   Yes, it means a British person? So valid? 

   Therefore, we guess ""LIMEY"".

### Consolidating Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - Absent: C, R, A, N  
   - E present but not in position 5.  
2. **Guess 2: ""eight""**  
   - E present but not in position 1.  
   - I correct in position 2 (fixed).  
   - Absent: G, H, T.  
3. **Guess 3: ""piled""**  
   - Absent: P, D.  
   - L present but wrong position (not position 3).  
   - E correct in position 4 (fixed).  
4. **Guess 4: ""lives""**  
   - L correct in position 1 (fixed).  
   - I correct (position 2, fixed).  
   - E correct (position 4, fixed).  
   - Absent: V, S.  

### Deductions:
- **Secret word pattern**: `L I ? E ?` (positions 1–5).  
  - Fixed: Position 1 = L, Position 2 = I, Position 4 = E.  
  - Missing: Position 3 and 5.  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D, V, S (exclude from guesses).  
- **Available letters**: B, F, J, K, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.  
- **No other present letters** → Positions 3 and 5 must be filled from available letters.  

### Strategy:
Test the highest-probability word fitting `L I _ E _` using common available letters.  
- **""LIMEY""** (valid English word meaning ""a British person""):  
  - Position 3: **M** (new test).  
  - Position 5: **Y** (new test).  
- If correct, ✓. If not, feedback on M/Y reduces options for the final guess.

<guess>limey</guess>",limey,"We have the feedback from guess4: ""lives"" -> L(✓), I(✓), V(x), E(✓), S(x)

This means:
- L is correct and in the first position. So position 1 is L.
- I is correct in the second position (already known).
- V is absent (x) from the secret word.
- E is correct in the fourth position (already known).
- S is absent (x) from the secret word.

Now, combining all feedback:

1. Correctly placed letters:
   - Position 1: L
   - Position 2: I
   - Position 4: E

   So the secret word is: L I _ E _

2. Absent letters:
   From all guesses: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D, V, S are absent.
   So absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D, V, S.

3. Present letters:
   We have L, I, E (all placed). 
   Additionally, from guess3: L was present (now placed at position1), and no other letters were indicated as present besides E (placed) and I (placed).
   From guess4: V and S are absent.

   But note: we might have missed other letters? Since we only have one unplaced position (position 3 and 5) and we don't have any other present letters indicated.

   However, we know that the secret word must be 5 letters, and we have L, I, and E placed. So we are missing letters for positions 3 and 5.

   We don't have any known present letter left? Because in guess3, we only had L marked as present (but not placed then) and now it's placed. In other guesses, no other present letters.

   Therefore, the remaining two letters (position 3 and 5) must come from the available letters.

4. Available letters (not absent and not used yet?):
   We have excluded: C,R,A,N,G,H,T,P,D,V,S. So available: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z.

   Since there are no known present letters left unplaced, the secret word's letters are L, I, E, and two letters from the available set.

   The word pattern: L I ? E ?

   We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""LI"", ends with ""E"", and the third and fifth letters are from B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z? But note: the fifth letter is after E? So the pattern is: L I ? E ? -> so fifth letter can be any available letter.

   Actually, position 4 is E, so positions 3 and 5 are the unknowns.

   We must fill position 3 and position 5 with any two distinct letters from the available set? Unless the word has double letters? But we don't know.

   However, we haven't seen any double letters so far? 

5. Constraints from feedback:
   In guess3: ""piled"" had L in position 3? and it was marked as '-'? But now we know L is in position 1? So that was consistent? And E was correctly placed at 4? Also, we had P and D absent.

   In guess4: ""lives"" had V in position 3 and S in position 5? and they were absent? So we know the secret word's position 3 is not V? and position 5 is not S? 

   But V and S are now absent? So excluded.

   We have 3 guesses left? 

   We need to guess a word that matches: 
        Position 1: L
        Position 2: I
        Position 3: ? (from available: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z)
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: ? (from available: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z)

   And it must be a valid English word? 

   We can try to think of words fitting ""LI_E_""

   Examples:
      ""LIKED"" -> but D is absent? 
      ""LITER"" -> T is absent? 
      ""LIBEL"" -> but we already know L is in first? and here L is also at last? but in ""lives"" we tested S? now we test B? 
          However, we don't know about B? 
          But pattern: ""LI_B E"" -> no? ""LIBEL"" is L I B E L -> so position 3 is B, position 5 is L? 
          But can we have two L's? It's possible? 
          Also, D is absent? 

      ""LIBEL"": L I B E L -> 
          Letters: L (twice), I, B, E.
          Absent letters: D? but B is not absent? 
          But we have absent: D is absent? but ""LIBEL"" doesn't have D? 
          So we can consider? 

      But in guess4, we tested V and S? That doesn't conflict? 

      However, we have two L's? In the secret word? 
      But we never tested a word with two L's? 

      Is it possible? 

      How would feedback work? 
      In ""piled"": we had only one L? and it was marked present but wrong position? 
      If the secret word had two L's? Then that L could be one of them? 
      But we don't know? 

      Now, we have the word ""LIBEL"": 
          Positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L.

      We don't know if L can be in position 5? 

      Alternatively, words without double L? 
        ""LIKE_"" -> but K is available? ""LIKE"" is 4 letters? 
        ""LIMEY"" -> L I M E Y -> avoids absent? 
           Position 3: M, Position 5: Y? 
        ""LINER"" -> N is absent? 
        ""LIBER"" -> B? but R absent? 
        ""LIMED"" -> D absent? 
        ""LIFER"" -> R absent? 

      ""LIMEY"": L I M E Y -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:M, 4:E, 5:Y.

      ""LIMBO"": L I M B O -> but pattern is LI_ E _? no, it doesn't have E in the fourth? unless ""LIMB O""? But ""LIMBO"" has E? No, it's L,I,M,B,O -> no E? 

      We need E in the fourth? So the word must end with E? only if there's a fifth letter? 

      Actually, the word is L I ? E ? -> so the last letter is the fifth? 

      So words: 
        ""L I ? E ?"" -> four letters in between? 

      We can list: 
        ""LIBER"" -> not, R absent? 
        ""LICET"" -> not a word? 

      ""LISLE"" -> but S is absent? 

      ""LITRE"" -> T absent? 

      So let's think: 
        ""LI E_"" ... no.

      The fourth letter is E? So after E, one letter? 

      Words like: 
        ""L I F E X"" -> ""LIFEX"" not a word? 
        ""L I F E B"" -> not a word? 
        ""L I B E X"" -> ""LIBEX"" not word? 
        ""L I B E L"" -> ""LIBEL"" (valid)

      ""L I V E S"" -> we tried ""LIVES"", but V and S absent? 

      ""L I K E S"" -> ""LIKES"": K is available? but S absent? 

      ""L I M E S"" -> ""LIMES"": M and S? S is absent? 

      ""L I M E ?"" -> without S? 
          ""LIMEY"" -> L I M E Y -> valid (meaning: a British person)

      So ""LIMEY"" is a valid word? 

      Also, ""LITRE"" is invalid because T absent? 

      ""LIBER"" invalid? 

      ""LIEGE"" -> L I E G E? But pattern: position 1:L,2:I,3:E? Oh, we need E at position 4? In ""LIEGE"", the E is in position 3 and 5? So not? 

      ""LIBER"" -> L I B E R -> then E is at position 4? and fifth is R? But R is absent? 

      So available words: 
         ""LIBEL"": L I B E L -> B at position 3? and L at 5? 
         ""LICE?"" -> no? 
         ""LIMEY"": L I M E Y -> M at 3, Y at 5? 
         ""LIFEY"" -> not a word? 
         ""LINEY"" -> N absent? 
         ""LIKEN"" -> N absent? 
         ""LIKED"" -> L I K E D -> D absent? 
         ""LIKE "" -> incomplete?

      Also, ""LIPES"" -> P and S absent? 

      And ""LIBER"" -> R absent? 

      So the only common words seem to be ""LIBEL"" and ""LIMEY"". 

      Since we have V and S absent, we can now use the available letters? 

      We can also try ""LIEVE"" -> not a standard word? 

      But we'll consider ""LIBEL"" and ""LIMEY"". 

      We have to choose one? 

      Let's see which gives more information? 

      ""LIBEL"": 
        - Tests B: in position 3? 
        - And tests L in position 5? (we already know L is present? 
        But if the secret word has L only once (in position 1), then position 5 L will be marked as absent? 
        Else if twice? then ✓? 

      ""LIMEY"": 
        - Tests M: in position 3? 
        - Tests Y: in position 5? 

      Since we haven't tested B, M, Y, etc., either is good? 

      But ""LIMEY"" has the advantage of using two new letters? 

      But we have one guess? Wait, we have 2 more guesses? 

      Actually, we have 4 guesses so far? and 6 total? So 2 left? 

      We can choose ""LIMEY"". 

      Also, consider: the secret word might not have two L's? So if we have ""LIMEY"", we avoid duplication? 

      Therefore, I choose ""LIMEY"". 

      Guess: ""limey""

   But wait: let's check feedback for ""limey""? 
      It has L in first (which is correct?), I second? M in third? E fourth? Y fifth? 

      So positions: 
        1: L -> should be ✓
        2: I -> ✓
        3: M -> if M in the word? if at third? ✓? 
        4: E -> ✓
        5: Y -> ?

      If the secret word is ""LIMEY"", all ✓. 
      If not, we get feedback on M and Y? 

      So we can then guess correctly in the last guess? 

      Therefore, we guess ""LIMEY"". 

   If there are other words? We might consider ""J"" or ""Q"", but not common? 

   But ""LIBEL"" is also a word? 

   Given two choices, we can also note that ""Y"" is a less common letter? 

   But I think ""LIMEY"" is acceptable? 

   Alternatively, ""LIKEN"" -> but N absent? 

   So final: guess ""LIMEY"" if it's in the word list? 

   We'll assume it is? 

   If not, we can pick ""LIBEL""? But let me see which is more common? 

   ""LIBEL"" is more common? But ""LIMEY"" is also an English word? 

   To be safe, we can try ""LIBEL""? 

   But note: in our available letters, we have not tested B? 

   But we are running out of guesses? We can only test one? 

   Given that we have 2 guesses left? 

   We can try ""LIBEL"" and if it doesn't work? Then we know? 

   But the secret word must be ""LIBEL"" or ""LIMEY""? 

   Wait, not necessarily? There might be other words? 

   Like: 
        L I F E R -> but R absent? 
        L I Z E R -> Z and R? 
        L I Z E ? -> ""LIZER"" not word? 

        L I B E M -> ""LIBEM"" not word? 

        L I M E D -> D absent? 

        L I K E S -> S absent? 

        L I M E S -> S absent? 

        L I M E B -> ""LIMEB"" not word? 

        L I M E C -> C absent? 

        L I K E N -> N absent? 

        L I B E S -> S absent? 

      ""L I F E "" ... 

      So perhaps ""LIBEL"" and ""LIMEY"" are the only ones? 

      Another: ""LINEN"" -> N absent? 

      ""LIKE?"" -> 

      ""LIRE?"" -> R absent? 

      So we have ""LIBEL"" and ""LIMEY""? 

      Also, ""LITH?"" -> no? 

      ""LIVID"" -> V absent? 

      So really, only two? 

      So we can try one? 

      We'll try ""LIMEY"". 

      Guess: ""limey""

   But note: the game rules: valid English words? 

   ""LIMEY"" is in the dictionary? 

   Yes, it means a British person? So valid? 

   Therefore, we guess ""LIMEY"".

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,libel,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the secret word.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 Since C, R, A, and N are all absent, we know that the secret word does not contain these letters.

 The feedback for E was a '-' meaning E is in the word but not in the fifth position (since we guessed it in the fifth position).

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, but not at the end. Also, it does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 We have 5 tries left.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Is a 5-letter English word.
 - Avoids the letters C, R, A, N because they are absent.
 - Must contain E (since E is present) but not in the fifth position.

 Additionally, we can use common letters to maximize information.

 Since we know E is in the word, we can try to place E in a different position.

 Common consonants remaining: we can use letters like S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 Let's choose a word that has E in a different position and avoids C,R,A,N.

 We also note that the secret word has E, but not in the fifth position. So E must be in one of positions 1-4.

 Possible starting words: We need a word without C,R,A,N.

 Some options: 
   We could try ""SPIEL"", but let's think of words that have E and other common letters.

 Another idea: ""HOUSE"" -> but note that E is at the end, and we know E isn't at the end? 
   However, our feedback says E is in the word but not in the fifth position. So we cannot put E in the fifth position again.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STOLE"": 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end? But we are not allowed to put E at the end? 
   Actually, we can put E at the end again? Let me clarify: The feedback says E is present but not in the fifth position. 
   That is, in this particular word, E was in the fifth position and it was wrong. 
   But E might appear more than once? The feedback does not indicate multiple E's. 
   However, the secret word might have only one E? 

 So when we guess, we can try E in a different position. Avoiding fifth.

 Let me avoid E in the fifth position.

 Some words without E at the end:

   First position: ""EAGLE"" -> but A is already eliminated? We know A is not in the word, so ""EAGLE"" has A which is bad.

   Second position: like ""LEMON"" -> but L,E,M,O,N? Wait, N is eliminated! So we cannot use N.

   Third position: ""PLUME"" -> E at the end? Not good.

   Fourth position: ""SMILE"" -> E at the end? Not good.

 We need E not in the fifth. So positions 1,2,3,4.

 Let me think of words with E in the first position that do not contain C,R,A,N.

 Examples: 
   ""EAGLE"" has A -> invalid because A is absent.
   ""EERIE"" has multiple E's? And avoids A,C,N,R? But it has R? Wait, R is absent so we cannot use R? 
   Actually, R is absent so we cannot include R. ""EERIE"" has R? No: EERIE has letters E, E, R, I, E? 
   Actually: E E R I E? That has R? So avoid.

   ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth positions? And avoids A,C,R,N? Letters: E, D, G, E, S -> no C,R,A,N.

   But we don't know if the word has multiple E's? We only know there is at least one E. 
   However, we are trying to maximize new information.

   Another word: ""EBONY"" -> has N? No, we know N is absent. So avoid N.

   ""ELOPE"": Letters: E, L, O, P, E -> avoids C,R,A,N? And E in first and fifth? But we know E is not in fifth? 
   We are not sure about fifth? Actually, our feedback said E is present but not in fifth? 
   So the secret word has at least one E that is not in the fifth position. 
   It could have another E in the fifth? But we don't know.

   However, we want to avoid the fifth position for E because we know that the fifth letter is not E? 
   Actually, the feedback tells us that the fifth letter was not E in the secret word? 
   Our guess ""crane"" had E at the fifth, and it was marked as '-' meaning E is in the word but not at that spot. 
   So the fifth letter of the secret word is not E. Therefore, we should avoid putting E in the fifth again? 
   But we can put it again? It doesn't matter because we are trying to learn more.

   However, we already know E is not in fifth? So we should try E in a different position.

   Let's choose a word with E not in fifth and without C,R,A,N.

   Words with E in position 1: 
      ELBOW -> letters: E, L, B, O, W -> avoids A,C,R,N?
      ELITE -> E, L, I, T, E -> but we use E twice? And avoids C,R,A,N? 
          However, note: we don't know if the secret word has two E's? So it's okay.

   But let's look for words with more common letters.

   Another common letter is T, so I might want to include T.

   Word with E in second position? 
      ""TEETH"" -> E in second and fourth? But T is used twice? 
      But avoids A,C,R,N? 
          Also, we don't know about T? 

   We haven't tested T yet? So we can use T.

   Common starting words with E and avoiding C,R,A,N: 
      ""SLATE"" -> S,L,A,T,E? But A is eliminated -> invalid.
      ""ROAST"" -> has R and A -> invalid.

   How about ""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? But E is at the fourth position? And the fifth letter is L? 

   But note: we need words without A, R, N, C.

   Another: ""BOWEL"": B,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? 

   But we also want to test more new letters.

   Let's list available letters: we haven't used many.

   We know E is present. We have used C,R,A,N,E (from first guess). 

   So available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

   We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter in the secret word.

   Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, S, T, L, O, I, ... but we already know E is there.

   So include S, T, L, O.

   How about a word that has E and S, T, L, O? Without using C,R,A,N.

   Example: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        But note: ""STOLE"" has E at the end? We don't want to put E at the end? 
        Because we know the fifth letter is not E? 
        But we can use it to test other positions? 

        We are forced to put E somewhere? The feedback does not forbid E at the end? 
        We just know that it's not in the fifth position? So putting E at the end again would not help? 
        Because we already know E is present and not at the fifth? 

        However, the secret word might have E at more than one position? 
        We don't know. So by putting E at the end again, if the secret word has two E's? 
        Then we would get '-' for E again? 

        Alternatively, we might learn about other letters.

   Since we have E present, we can try to place it in a different position to see where it goes.

   Why not put E at the beginning? 

   Let me choose ""ELOPS"": but I'm not sure if it's a valid word? 

   Alternatively, ""STOLE"" is valid? But E at the end is redundant? 

   Another word: ""HOMES"" -> H,O,M,E,S -> E is fourth? 
   Also, avoids A,C,R,N? 

   Or ""TIMES"": T,I,M,E,S -> E in fourth? 

   Or ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> E in fifth? We avoid fifth? 

   Let's avoid E in fifth? 

   How about ""TILES"": T,I,L,E,S -> E in fourth? 
   But that's one letter? 

   Another idea: ""FLUID"", but no E? We must include E? Or we don't have to? 
   Actually, we don't have to include E? But note: the feedback only tells us that E is in the word? 
   But we have not confirmed where? So including E in a different position might help locate it.

   However, if we don't include E, we might not get information about E? But we already know E is present? 
   So we can choose words without E? That might help test other letters? 

   The rules say we can guess any valid word? But strategically, we want to find the word quickly.

   Since we know E is present, and we don't know its position, we should try E in a different position? 

   So I think we should put E in one of positions 1 to 4.

   Let me choose a word with E in the first position: 
      ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. 
      This way, if E is in the first position, we get a ✓ for E? Otherwise, if E is not in first, but in the word, we get a '-'? 

   Alternatively, we can put E in a more common position? 

   Common positions for E: not at the end? Then in the middle? 

   According to feedback, E was at fifth and that was wrong? So E must be in 1,2,3,4.

   We can also try E in the second position? 

   Let me pick a word with E in the second position and common letters: 
      ""BELLY"": B,E,L,L,Y -> but double L? 
      ""TEETH"": double E? 
      ""BESTI"": no.

   How about ""METAL""? But A is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""LEMON"": but L,E,M,O,N? We have N? N is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""PETOS"": not a word? 

   Let me think: without A and N, and with E in second? 
      ""HELIO"" is not 5 letters? 
      ""DEUCE"" but D,E,U,C,E? C is eliminated -> invalid.

   Words with E in the third position: 
      ""CRUES"" -> C is eliminated -> invalid?
      ""SPIEL"": S,P,I,E,L -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        E is fourth? Wait: S P I E L -> third letter I, fourth E? 
        We want E in third? 

   Actually: 
      ""GRUEL"" -> G,R,U,E,L? R is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""SUEDE"": S,U,E,D,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. But E in third and fifth? 
        Fifth: we know E is not fifth? So we get '-' for third position? Or if the word has only one E? 

   This is getting messy.

   Since we have eliminated only 4 letters (C,R,A,N) and have 22 left? 

   Let's choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible? And put E in a non-fifth position.

   Example: ""SPIEL"" -> 
        letters: S, P, I, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.
        E is in the fifth? Wait: 
            P-O-S-I-T-I-O-N: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E? Wait, it's S-P-I-E-L -> so E is fourth? 
            So E in fourth position? 
        Then fifth is L? 
        That's fine.

   Or ""TOWED"": T,O,W,E,D -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fourth? 

   Or ""MOVIE"": M,O,V,I,E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fifth? We avoid? 

   So ""SPIEL"" sounds good: 
        S, P, I, E, L -> no duplicates? 

   We'll use that? 

   But note: we must be cautious: E is in fourth position? 

   What if the secret word has E in the first position? Then we would get S,P,I -> all absent? 
   And E as '-', L absent? That might not be informative? 

   Alternatively, we can use a word that starts with E? 

   Let me look for a better word? 

   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E at the end? We avoid? 

   ""STOLE"": E at the end? We avoid? 

   But we can try ""STEEL""? But not 5 distinct letters? 

   How about ""KELP""? Not 5 letters? 

   I think ""QUEST"": Q,U,E,S,T -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in third? 
        But Q is uncommon? 

   Let me go with ""SPIEL"". 

   So we guess ""SPIEL""? 

   But note: we might get more information.

   Alternatively, we can try ""E"", in the first position? 

   Let me decide: 

   Option 1: ""ELTCH"" (not a word) -> no.

   Option 2: ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth? Avoid C,R,A,N? Yes. Letters: E,D,G,E,S -> duplicates E? 
        If we guess it, the duplicate E might be confusing? 
        But the feedback will show: 
            First E: ✓ or -? 
            Fourth E? If the word has only one E and in the first? Then we get E(✓) and then E(x) for fourth? 
            Or if it also has E elsewhere? 

   But we don't know? 

   How about ""STOLE""? Even though E is at the end? We know the fifth letter is not E. 
        But if we put E at the end again, then the feedback for E will be '-', meaning E is present but not at fifth? 
        But we already know that? And we might learn about the other positions? 

        Actually, we haven't tested the fifth letter? We only know it's not E? So we can test other letters? 

        So ""STOLE"" has E at fifth? And we know it's not E? So we expect a '-' for E? 
        But we will learn about S,T,O,L: 
            If any of them are in the word? 

        However, we are testing S,T,O,L? 

        Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" tests S,P,I,E,L? 

        Either is fine? 

   Considering that E is already known to be present? Maybe we can avoid including E? 

   Actually, we have 5 guesses left? And we don't lose much? 

   However, we want to cover common letters? 

   Common letters: S, T, L, O, I are common? 

   So ""STOLE"" tests S,T,O,L,E? 
   But E at fifth: we expect a '-'? 
   Then we would get: 
        S at position 1 -> (✓ or - or x)
        T at 2 -> similarly
        O at 3 -> similarly
        L at 4 -> similarly
        E at 5 -> will be '-' (as expected)

   Since we know E is present? Then regardless of other letters? 

   But we are testing 5 letters? With E being known? 

   Alternatively, I found a word: ""STILE"" (a type of ladder)? S,T,I,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        Also, E is at fifth? And we avoid fifth? 

   But note: we haven't tried words with E not at fifth? 

   Given that we already know E is present and not at fifth, we might try to find E's position by putting it in an early position? 

   Let me choose a word that starts with E? 

   Example: ""ELAND""? Has A? A is eliminated -> invalid.

   ""EDGED""? Doubled E and D? 

   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.
        E in first? 
        This tests E,I,G,H,T? 

   Also, ""INLET"": I,N,L,E,T -> has N? Eliminated? 

   ""EASEL""? has A and E doubled? 

   ""EVITE"": E,V,I,T,E -> avoid? 

   ""ETUDE"": E,T,U,D,E -> avoid duplicates? 

   ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.

        So ""EXIST"": E(1), X(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). 
        But T is at fifth? We don't know about T? 

   But note, we don't want to use fifth for E? But fifth here is T? 

   So ""EXIST"" has E at first? 

   I think ""EXIST"" or ""EIGHT""?

   Commonality: S is more common than G and H? 

   So ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> it tests E at first? 

   We might get E(✓) if E is at first? 

   Otherwise, E(-) if E is elsewhere? 

   So let me choose a word like ""EXIST"".

   We have to decide.

   Given the above, I will choose ""EXIST"". 

   So our second guess: ""EXIST""

   But let me see: 
        We avoid C,R,A,N? Yes: E,X,I,S,T doesn't have any of C,R,A,N.

   So guess ""EXIST"".

   Alternatively, if we want to avoid X? because X is rare? 

   Then ""MIDST"" -> M,I,D,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        But doesn't include E? Then we don't test E? 
        But we know E is present? So by not including E, we might get no feedback for E? 
        And then we don't learn about the position? 
        However, we will learn about these letters? 

        But if the word has E, and E is in ""MIDST"", we would not learn its position? 

        Actually, the feedback will still be: 
            If M is not in word -> x
            I -> if in word and in position: ✓ or -? 
            D -> same
            S -> same
            T -> same

        And if E is in the word? It doesn't come up? 

        So we don't get info on E? 

        That's bad because we know E is present? 

        We should include E? 

   Therefore, we must include E? 

   So I go with ""EXIST"" or ""SPIEL""? 

   After consideration, let me choose ""SPIEL"": 
        Reason: It includes E (but not fifth? fourth instead) and avoids C,R,A,N? 
        Also, letters S,P,I,E,L -> common letters? 

   We'll guess ""SPIEL"".

   But note: position of E? In ""SPIEL"" the positions are: 
        1: S
        2: P
        3: I
        4: E
        5: L

   So we are testing E in fourth? 

   If the secret word has E in fourth? We get ✓ for E? 
   Otherwise, if it has E elsewhere? Then '-' for E? 

   But let's hope we get some other hits? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word with E in the first? 

   Since we don't know? But time is short? 

   Another common word: ""POUND"" -> skip because we don't have E? 

   We must include E? 

   So ""QUEUE"" is not helpful? 

   Final: Guess ""SPIEL""

   Or ""E"", first: ""ENTRY"" -> has N? and R? -> invalid.

   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? 
        And E in first? 

   I think ""EIGHT"" is a good word? 

   So I'll choose ""EIGHT""

   Why? It tests E at position 1? And I,G,H,T? 

   We haven't tested G,H,T,I? 

   Common letters: I, T, H are common? 

   Let's do ""EIGHT""

   So guess: ""EIGHT""

   Second guess: ""eight""

   But note: E is at first? 

   We expect if E is first, ✓. If not, then '-' because we know E is present? 

   But what if the secret word has no E at the first? Then we get '-' and we know E is in the word? 

   So this is acceptable.

   We proceed with ""EIGHT"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked as ""-"").

This means:
- The secret word contains the letter E, located in positions 1–4.
- The letters C, R, A, and N must be excluded from all subsequent guesses.

For the next guess:
- We need to include E in a different position (anywhere except the 5th) to help identify its correct location.
- Letters like T, I, G, and H are strong choices because they are common in English words and haven't been tested yet.
- ""EIGHT"" aligns with these criteria: 
  - E is placed in position 1 (testing if E appears there).
  - T, I, G, and H are new letters that maximize information gain.
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

This guess will help narrow down the position of E and test four additional common letters efficiently.

<guess>eight</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
  C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.
  E is present but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
Meaning:
  E is present but not in the 1st position (since we guessed it in the first position and got '-'). 
  I is present and in the correct position (2nd position, because in ""eight"", I is the second letter).
  G, H, T are absent.

So from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T
Present letters: E (but not in 1st or 5th position) and I (which is in the 2nd position).

Therefore, the secret word has:
  - The second letter is I.
  - The letter E is present, but not in the 1st, 2nd (because second is I), or 5th position. So E must be in the 3rd or 4th position.

We also know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

We have 4 tries left.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
  - Has 5 letters, all from the remaining possible letters (excluding absent ones).
  - Must have I in the second position.
  - Must include E in either the 3rd or 4th position (to check which one).
  - Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

Available letters: 
  We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, G, H, T (from the two guesses). 
  But note: E and I are present, so they are still in play (but we know I is fixed at position 2).

  The alphabet without the absent letters: 
    B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

  And we know E must be included (but not in 1st, 2nd, or 5th) and I is fixed at position 2.

So the secret word pattern is: 
  Position 1: one of B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but not E, because E is not in 1st)
  Position 2: I (fixed)
  Position 3: either E or one of the available letters? But note: E must be in the word, and it can only be in 3rd or 4th. So either position 3 or 4 must be E.
  Position 4: similarly, if E is not in 3rd, then it must be in 4th.
  Position 5: one of the available letters (but not E, because E is not in 5th).

We can try to form a word that has I in the second position and E in the third position? Or in the fourth?

We should also try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Option 1: Assume E is in the 3rd position -> pattern: _ I E _ _
Option 2: Assume E is in the 4th position -> pattern: _ I _ E _

We don't know which, so we can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in the 3rd position and then if it's not there, we know it must be in the 4th? 

But we can also choose a word that doesn't have E at all? But we must include E because we know it's present? 

Wait, we must include E? Actually, we don't have to? But if we don't include E, then we won't get information about E's position? 

But we know E is present? So if we don't include E, we will get all the other letters' feedback, but we won't learn about E? 

However, we can still get the feedback for the letters we do include? 

But we have limited guesses? So it's better to include E to try to locate it? 

So let's include E in either the 3rd or 4th position? 

We can choose a word that has E in the 3rd position? 

For example: 
  Pattern: _ I E _ _

We need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with available letters.

Available letters: B,D,F,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: S, L, O, P, D, etc.

Example words: 
  ""SIEVE"" -> S I E V E -> but E is in 3rd and 5th? But we cannot have E in 5th? 
      Also, V is present? 
      But note: we are going to put E in 3rd? and 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? So we cannot use E in 5th? 
      So ""SIEVE"" is invalid because it has E in 5th? 

  ""SIEVE"" is not allowed? Because we know E is not in 5th? So we must avoid E in 5th? 

  ""DIET_"" -> but we need 5 letters? ""DIETS"" -> D I E T S -> but T is absent? T is eliminated? 

  ""LIEU_"" -> ""LIEUS"" (a word? meaning a unit of the French currency) -> L I E U S -> avoids absent letters? 
        Letters: L, I, E, U, S -> all allowed? 
        But E is in 3rd? 
        And no E in 5th? 

  ""BIELD"" (Scottish word for shelter) -> B I E L D -> avoids absent letters? 
        B, I, E, L, D -> all allowed? 

  ""PIECE"" -> P I E C E -> but C is absent? 

  ""FIELD"" -> F I E L D -> avoids absent letters? 
        F, I, E, L, D -> all allowed? 

  ""WIELD"" -> W I E L D -> same.

  ""PIEZO"" -> P I E Z O -> avoids absent? 

But note: we are not sure if these words are in the word list? 

Alternatively, we can try E in the 4th position? 

Pattern: _ I _ E _

Example: 
  ""SIRED"" -> S I R E D -> but R is absent? 
  ""FILED"" -> F I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        F, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 

  ""MILER"" -> M I L E R -> R absent? 
  ""BIDES"" -> B I D E S -> avoids absent? 

  ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S -> avoids absent? 

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

We can choose either pattern? 

But we want to maximize information? 

We know that E is either in 3rd or 4th? So if we choose a word with E in 3rd, we can test that hypothesis? 

If we get E(✓) in 3rd, then we know E is in 3rd? 
If we get E(-) in 3rd, then E is not in 3rd? So it must be in 4th? 

Similarly, if we put E in 4th? 

So either way, we can get the position? 

But we also want to test other letters? 

So let's choose a word that has E in 3rd and has common letters? 

I'll go with ""FIELD"": F I E L D -> 
  F: new letter
  I: already known to be in second? so we expect ✓ for I? 
  E: in 3rd? we test if E is in 3rd? 
  L: new letter? 
  D: new letter? 

But note: we are using F, L, D? 

Alternatively, ""WIELD"": W I E L D -> same? 

But ""FIELD"" is more common? 

However, we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't know? 

But we haven't seen any repeated letters so far? 

Another idea: we can choose a word that has E in 3rd and also includes other common letters? 

But we have limited letters? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E in 4th? 

But let's stick with E in 3rd? 

I choose ""FIELD"". 

But wait: what if the secret word is ""FIELD""? Then we win? 

But we don't know? 

But let's see: 
  If we guess ""FIELD"", and the secret word has E in 3rd? Then we get:
      F: ? 
      I: ✓ (because second is I)
      E: ✓ (if E is in 3rd) 
      L: ? 
      D: ?

  If the secret word is ""FIELD"", then we get all ✓? 

  But if not, we get feedback on F, L, D? 

  Also, if E is not in 3rd, then we get E(-) meaning E is present but not in 3rd? Then we know E must be in 4th? 

So it's a good test? 

But note: we are using F, L, D? 

We could use more common letters? 

Common letters: S, O, L, D, etc. 

How about ""SILED""? Not a common word? 

""OILED"": O I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        O, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 
        But E is in 4th? 

But we are testing E in 4th? 

We can do that? 

But we don't know if E is in 3rd or 4th? 

So if we choose ""OILED"", we are testing E in 4th? 

If we get E(✓) in 4th, then we know E is in 4th? 
If we get E(-) in 4th, then E is not in 4th? So it must be in 3rd? 

So both ""FIELD"" (E in 3rd) and ""OILED"" (E in 4th) are valid? 

But we can only choose one? 

I think we should choose one that uses more common letters? 

""OILED"" has O, L, D? 

""FIELD"" has F, L, D? 

O is more common than F? 

But we don't know? 

Another word: ""SIDLE"": S I D L E -> but E is in 5th? Not allowed? 

""QUIET"": Q U I E T -> T is absent? 

""JUICY"": J U I C Y -> C absent? 

""PILED"": P I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        P, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 
        E in 4th? 

""PILED"" is a word? 

Similarly, ""WIPED"": W I P E D -> avoids absent? 

But we have to avoid T? 

I think ""PILED"" is a good choice? 

But let me compare:

  ""FIELD"": tests E in 3rd, and letters F, L, D? 
  ""PILED"": tests E in 4th, and letters P, L, D? 

We already know I is in second? 

In ""PILED"", the I is in second? So we expect I(✓). 

We can choose either? 

But note: we haven't tested S? S is a very common letter? 

So maybe we should include S? 

Pattern for E in 3rd: _ I E _ _ 
  With S: 
      Position 1: S -> ""SIE??"" 
      We need two more letters? 
      Example: ""SIEVE"" -> invalid because of E at the end? 
      ""SIEGE"" -> S I E G E -> but G is absent? 
      ""SIECE"" -> not a word? 
      ""SIELD"" -> not a word? 
      ""SIEUR"" -> S I E U R -> R is absent? 

Pattern for E in 4th: _ I _ E _ 
  With S: 
      ""S I ? E ?"" 
      Example: ""SIRED"" -> R absent? 
      ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S -> avoids absent? 
          D is allowed? 
          But note: S is used twice? 
          Also, E is in 4th? 
          And fifth is S? 
          So ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S? 
          But we don't know if the word allows duplicates? 

      ""SINES"" -> S I N E S -> N is absent? 
      ""SILES"" -> not a word? 
      ""SITES"" -> T is absent? 
      ""SIVES"" -> not common? 

  ""SIXES"" -> S I X E S -> avoids absent? 
        But X is allowed? 
        And S is duplicated? 

  ""SIZES"" -> S I Z E S -> avoids absent? 

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

The rules don't say? But in Wordle, duplicates are allowed? 

But in our feedback, we haven't seen any duplicates? 

But the secret word might have duplicates? 

However, to be safe, we can avoid duplicates? 

So ""SIDES"" is a word? And it has two S's? 

But we are testing S in first and fifth? 

If the secret word has only one S? Then we might get S(✓) and S(x) for the fifth? 

But it's acceptable? 

But we are not sure? 

Alternatively, without duplicates: 

  ""SIXES"" has two S's? 

  ""SIXTH"" -> T and H absent? 

  ""SIXTY"" -> T absent? 

  ""SILED"" -> S I L E D -> avoids absent? 
        S, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? 
        E in 4th? 

  ""SILED"" is a word? (past tense of sile: to descend, as a hawk) 

  But not common? 

  ""SIPED"" -> not a word? 

  ""SIMES"" -> not a word? 

  ""SIBYL"" -> S I B Y L -> avoids absent? 
        But no E? We must include E? 

  We must include E? 

  So ""SILED"" is acceptable? 

  But we are testing E in 4th? 

  Similarly, we can do ""SIDED"" -> but D repeated? 

  ""SIDED"" has two D's? 

  ""SIDLE"" -> S I D L E -> E in fifth? Not allowed? 

So I think ""SILED"" is acceptable? 

But to use common words, I'll avoid ""SILED"". 

Another common word: ""DOILY"" -> no E? 

We must include E? 

So I think ""PILED"" is a common word? 

I'll go with ""PILED"": 
  P I L E D 
  This tests:
      P in first? 
      I in second: ✓ (we know)
      L in third? 
      E in fourth? 
      D in fifth? 

  If E is in fourth, we get E(✓) and then we know the position? 
  If E is not in fourth, we get E(-) meaning E is present but not in fourth? Then we know E must be in third? 

  Also, we test P, L, D? 

  So we get information on three new letters? 

  And we avoid the absent letters? 

  So I choose ""PILED"". 

But note: we are testing E in the fourth position? 

Alternatively, we can test E in the third? 

But we have to choose one? 

I think it's symmetric? 

So I'll go with ""PILED"". 

Guess: ""PILED""

But let me confirm: 
  We have not used P, L, D before? 
  And we avoid C,R,A,N,G,H,T? 

Yes.

So <guess>piled</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A, N are absent (x), E is present but not in the 5th position (-).
- **Guess 2: ""eight""** → E is present but not in the 1st position (-), I is correct and in the 2nd position (✓), and G, H, T are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
1. **I is fixed in the 2nd position** of the secret word.
2. **E is present** but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since position 2 is I, and E was misplaced in positions 1 and 5). Thus, E must be in **position 3 or 4**.
3. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T (cannot be used).
4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **E in the 4th position** to narrow down its location (if E is not in the 4th, it must be in the 3rd).
- Include **new common letters** (P, L, D) to maximize information.
- Use a valid word that fits the pattern `_ I _ E _` and avoids absent letters.

The word **""PILED""** is chosen because:
- It places I in the 2nd position (✓, as required).
- It tests E in the 4th position (if E is here, it will be ✓; if not, E must be in the 3rd).
- It introduces three new common letters (P, L, D) to check for presence/position.
- It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, N, G, H, T).

<guess>piled</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)
Guess 3: piled -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) L(-) E(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent. E is present but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
  Meaning: E is present but not in the 1st position. I is present and in the correct position (2nd). G, H, T are absent.

Guess 3: ""piled"" -> P(x), I(✓), L(-), E(✓), D(x)
  Meaning: P is absent. I is correct in the 2nd position (again). L is present but not in the 3rd position. E is present and in the correct position (4th). D is absent.

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. Correctly positioned letters:
   - I is in the 2nd position.
   - E is in the 4th position.

   So the secret word has the form: _ I _ E _

2. Present letters but not in the guessed positions:
   - E was previously marked as present but not in 1st (from guess2) and not in 5th (from guess1). Now we know it is in 4th (from guess3).
   - L is present but not in the 3rd position (from guess3). Since the 4th position is E, L must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th? But wait, the word is _ I _ E _, so positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
        Position 2: I
        Position 4: E
        So L is present and not in 3rd, so it must be in position 1 or 5? But note: we have only 5 positions.

   However, we must consider that L could be in position 1 or 5? But we don't have a 5th position for L? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 5 are open? But we know position 3 was guessed as L in ""piled"" and it was marked as '-', meaning L is not in position 3. So L must be in position 1 or 5.

3. Absent letters:
   From all guesses: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D are absent.

   So absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D.

4. Present letters (including those correctly placed and misplaced):
   - E (in position 4)
   - I (in position 2)
   - L (present, but not in position 3, so must be in 1 or 5)

   Also, from guess1, we know E is present (and now we know it's in 4th). From guess2, I is present (in 2nd). From guess3, L is present (but not in 3rd).

   So the secret word contains at least: I, E, L.

   And we have two positions to fill: 1, 3, and 5? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 5 are unknown, but we know one of position 1 or 5 must be L? And the other two must be filled with letters that are not absent and not already known? 

   But note: the word has 5 letters. We have:
        Position 1: ? (could be L or a new letter)
        Position 2: I
        Position 3: ? 
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: ? 

   And we know L is present and not in 3, so it must be in 1 or 5.

   Therefore, the word has L in either position 1 or 5, and the remaining two positions (if L is in 1, then positions 3 and 5; if L is in 5, then positions 1 and 3) must be filled with letters that are not absent and not I or E (which are already placed).

   But note: the word might have more than one L? The feedback doesn't indicate that. In guess3, we had only one L (in position 3) and it was marked as '-', meaning that L is present but not there. It doesn't say anything about other L's? So it's possible that L appears again? But we don't know.

   However, to be safe, we should consider that L might be only once? Or it might be twice? 

   But since we have limited information, we can assume for now that L appears only once? 

   Actually, the feedback for ""piled"" had only one L and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if there were two L's, we might have gotten two marks? But in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will mark each occurrence appropriately? 

   For example, if the word has two L's and we guess one in the correct position and one in the wrong, we would get one ✓ and one -? But in this case, we only have one L in the guess and it was marked as '-', meaning that there is at least one L that is not in that position. It doesn't rule out the possibility of another L? 

   However, we don't have evidence of a second L? So we can proceed with the assumption that there is only one L? 

   Therefore, L must be in position 1 or 5.

5. Available letters: 
   We have used: C,R,A,N,E,I,G,H,T,P,L,D (from the three guesses). 
   Absent: C,R,A,N,G,H,T,P,D -> so these cannot be used.
   Present: E, I, L (and we know E and I are fixed, L is to be placed).

   The remaining letters (not absent and not yet placed) are: 
        B, F, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

   But note: we have to fill the positions 1, 3, 5, but one of them is L (if L is only once). 

   So the word must have L in either 1 or 5, and the other two positions from the available letters.

   Also, the letter in position 3 must be one of the available letters (and not L, because if L is only once and we place it in 1 or 5, then position 3 cannot be L).

Now, we need to form a guess that helps us determine:
   - Where L is (position 1 or 5)?
   - What are the letters in the remaining positions?

But note: we have two unknowns (if we consider L's position) and three positions? Actually, we have:

Case 1: L in position 1 -> then the word is: L I ? E ? 
   Then positions 3 and 5 must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set (B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) and not L.

Case 2: L in position 5 -> then the word is: ? I ? E L
   Then positions 1 and 3 must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set.

We can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position 1 and then we see? Or in position 5? 

But we don't know? 

We can also choose a word that doesn't include L? But we know L is present? So if we don't include L, we will get an 'x' for L? But we know L is present? So that would be a waste? 

Therefore, we must include L? 

But we don't know if L is in 1 or 5? 

So we have to choose one? 

We can choose a word that has L in position 1? Then if L is in 1, we get ✓ for L? If not, we get '-' meaning L is present but not in 1? Then we know L must be in 5? 

Similarly, if we put L in 5, then if we get ✓ for L, it's in 5? If we get '-', then L is in 1? 

So either way, we can determine L's position? 

But we also want to test the other letters? 

So let's choose a word that has L in position 1? 

Then the pattern: L I ? E ? 

We need to fill positions 3 and 5 with available letters? 

We want to use common letters? 

For example: 
   Position 3: S (common)
   Position 5: O (common) -> ""L I S E O"" -> not a word? 

   ""L I V E S"" -> but that's 5 letters? ""LIVES"" -> but V is available? 

   ""L I V E S"" is 5 letters: L, I, V, E, S -> but we have E in 4th? So ""L I V E S"" -> positions: 
        1: L
        2: I
        3: V
        4: E
        5: S

   But the secret word has E in 4th? So that matches? 

   And ""LIVES"" is a word? 

   But note: we have to avoid absent letters? V and S are not in the absent list? 

   So ""LIVES"" is a candidate? 

   But what if the secret word is ""LIVES""? Then we win? 

   But we don't know? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common letters? 

   Another: ""L I K E S"" -> ""LIKES"" -> K is available? 

   ""LIKES"": L I K E S -> avoids absent? 

   But note: we are testing L in 1? 

   If L is not in 1, then we get L marked as '-'? meaning L is present but not in 1? Then we know L is in 5? 

   And we also test K and S? 

   So that's good? 

   But we have to consider that the secret word might have K? 

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in 5? 

   For example: "" ? I ? E L"" 

   Example: ""O I L E L"" -> but duplicate L? and O in first? 

   ""O I L E L"" is not a word? 

   ""S I Z E L"" -> S I Z E L -> ""SIZEL"" is not a word? 

   ""M I L E L"" -> not a word? 

   ""B I T E L"" -> not a word? 

   ""W I S E L"" -> not a word? 

   ""F I L E L"" -> not a word? 

   ""A I S L E"" -> but A is absent? 

   ""J I V E L"" -> ""JIVEL"" not a word? 

   ""V I E L L"" -> duplicate L? 

   It seems hard to find a word ending with ""IEL"" with E in the fourth? 

   Actually, the word is _ I _ E L -> so the last two letters are E and L? 

   Example: ""T I E L E"" -> but T is absent? 

   ""D I M E L"" -> D is absent? 

   ""B I K E L"" -> ""BIKEL"" not a word? 

   ""S I B E L"" -> ""SIBEL"" not common? 

   ""N I B E L"" -> N absent? 

   So it might be difficult to find a common word with L in the 5th? 

   Therefore, it might be more promising to assume L is in the 1st? 

   And we have words like ""LIVES"", ""LIKES"", etc. 

   But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? 

   Let me list words that fit the pattern for L in 1st: L I ? E ? 

   We have to fill the 3rd and 5th with letters from: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

   Common words:
      ""L I F E S"" -> ""LIFES"" not a word? 
      ""L I V E S"" -> ""LIVES"" (valid)
      ""L I K E S"" -> ""LIKES"" (valid)
      ""L I M E S"" -> ""LIMES"" (valid)
      ""L I N E S"" -> but N is absent? 
      ""L I P E S"" -> P absent? 
      ""L I B E L"" -> ""LIBEL"" (valid) but note: L in first and fifth? 
          If we use ""LIBEL"", then we have L in first and fifth? 
          But we don't know if the word allows two L's? 
          And we have to consider: if the secret word has two L's? 
          In our feedback, we only know that there is at least one L (from guess3). 
          So ""LIBEL"" is a possibility? 

   But if we guess ""LIBEL"", then:
        Position 1: L -> if L is in 1st, then ✓? 
        Position 2: I -> ✓
        Position 3: B -> ?
        Position 4: E -> ✓
        Position 5: L -> if the secret word has L in 5th, then ✓? But if the secret word has only one L (in 1st), then we get L in 5th marked as absent? 

   But we don't know? 

   However, if the secret word has only one L (in 1st), then we would get:
        L(✓) for first, and L(x) for fifth? 
        But we know L is present? So if we get L(x) for fifth, that means the fifth letter is not L? 

   But if the secret word has two L's, then we might get both? 

   But we don't have evidence of two L's? 

   So to avoid complexity, we can choose a word without duplicate L? 

   Therefore, ""LIVES"", ""LIKES"", ""LIMES"" are good? 

   Now, which one? 

   We want to test as many new letters as possible? 

   ""LIVES"": uses V and S? 
   ""LIKES"": uses K and S? 
   ""LIMES"": uses M and S? 

   V, K, M are all not tested? 

   We can choose one? 

   Since S is common, we can test S in the fifth? 

   But we don't know if S is in the word? 

   So I'll choose ""LIKES"" because K is less common? Or ""LIVES"" because V is less common? 

   Actually, we want to maximize the chance of hitting? 

   Common letters: S is more common than V, K, M? 

   So ""LIMES"" has M and S? 

   But we can also choose a word that has S in a different position? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""S"" in a position that might be in the secret word? 

   But we don't know? 

   I think ""LIVES"" is a good choice? 

   But note: we are also testing L in the first? 

   So I'll go with ""LIVES"". 

   Guess: ""LIVES""

   If the secret word is ""LIVES"", we win? 

   If not, we get feedback on V and S? 

   And also, if L is not in first, we get L marked as '-'? 

   But we expect L to be in first? 

   Alternatively, if we get L marked as '-', then we know L is in fifth? 

   So we can then focus on words ending with L? 

   So it's a good test? 

   Therefore, we guess ""LIVES"". 

But wait: what if the secret word has only one L and it is in the fifth? Then in ""LIVES"", we have L in first? 
   We would get: 
        L in first: marked as '-' (because L is present but not in first? and we know it must be in fifth? but we don't have L in fifth in the guess? so we get L marked as present but not in first? and then we know it must be in fifth? 
   And then we also get feedback on V and S? 

   So we can then make a next guess with L in fifth? 

   So it's acceptable? 

   We have 3 guesses left? 

   So I think it's a good move. 

   Let me count the guesses: we are about to make the 4th guess? 

   We have 3 guesses left? 

   So we can do it. 

   Therefore, we guess ""LIVES"". 

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? V and S are not absent? 

Yes.

So <guess>lives</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - C, R, A, N: Absent (x) → Excluded from future guesses.  
   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → E is in the word, **not in position 5**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""eight""**  
   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → E is **not in position 1**.  
   - I: Correct position (✓) → **I is in position 2**.  
   - G, H, T: Absent (x) → Excluded.  

3. **Guess 3: ""piled""**  
   - P: Absent (x) → Excluded.  
   - I: Correct position (✓) → Confirms **I in position 2**.  
   - L: Present but wrong position (-) → **L is in the word, not in position 3**.  
   - E: Correct position (✓) → **E is in position 4**.  
   - D: Absent (x) → Excluded.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ I _ E _` (positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  
  - Position 2 = I (fixed).  
  - Position 4 = E (fixed).  
- **Present letters**: I, E, L.  
  - L must be in **position 1 or 5** (since it can't be in position 3 and positions 2/4 are fixed).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D (excluded).  
- **Available letters**: B, F, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test L in position 1** to resolve its location:  
  - If L is in position 1, we get ✓.  
  - If L is not in position 1, we get (-) → L must be in position 5.  
- **Maximize new information**: Use common letters (S, V) in positions 3 and 5 to test their presence.  
- **Optimal word**: **""LIVES""** fits perfectly:  
  - `L` in position 1 (tests L's location).  
  - `I` in position 2 (✓, confirmed).  
  - `V` in position 3 (new letter).  
  - `E` in position 4 (✓, confirmed).  
  - `S` in position 5 (new letter).

<guess>lives</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)
Guess 3: piled -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) L(-) E(✓) D(x)
Guess 4: lives -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from guess4: ""lives"" -> L(✓), I(✓), V(x), E(✓), S(x)

This means:
- L is correct and in the first position. So position 1 is L.
- I is correct in the second position (already known).
- V is absent (x) from the secret word.
- E is correct in the fourth position (already known).
- S is absent (x) from the secret word.

Now, combining all feedback:

1. Correctly placed letters:
   - Position 1: L
   - Position 2: I
   - Position 4: E

   So the secret word is: L I _ E _

2. Absent letters:
   From all guesses: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D, V, S are absent.
   So absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D, V, S.

3. Present letters:
   We have L, I, E (all placed). 
   Additionally, from guess3: L was present (now placed at position1), and no other letters were indicated as present besides E (placed) and I (placed).
   From guess4: V and S are absent.

   But note: we might have missed other letters? Since we only have one unplaced position (position 3 and 5) and we don't have any other present letters indicated.

   However, we know that the secret word must be 5 letters, and we have L, I, and E placed. So we are missing letters for positions 3 and 5.

   We don't have any known present letter left? Because in guess3, we only had L marked as present (but not placed then) and now it's placed. In other guesses, no other present letters.

   Therefore, the remaining two letters (position 3 and 5) must come from the available letters.

4. Available letters (not absent and not used yet?):
   We have excluded: C,R,A,N,G,H,T,P,D,V,S. So available: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z.

   Since there are no known present letters left unplaced, the secret word's letters are L, I, E, and two letters from the available set.

   The word pattern: L I ? E ?

   We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""LI"", ends with ""E"", and the third and fifth letters are from B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z? But note: the fifth letter is after E? So the pattern is: L I ? E ? -> so fifth letter can be any available letter.

   Actually, position 4 is E, so positions 3 and 5 are the unknowns.

   We must fill position 3 and position 5 with any two distinct letters from the available set? Unless the word has double letters? But we don't know.

   However, we haven't seen any double letters so far? 

5. Constraints from feedback:
   In guess3: ""piled"" had L in position 3? and it was marked as '-'? But now we know L is in position 1? So that was consistent? And E was correctly placed at 4? Also, we had P and D absent.

   In guess4: ""lives"" had V in position 3 and S in position 5? and they were absent? So we know the secret word's position 3 is not V? and position 5 is not S? 

   But V and S are now absent? So excluded.

   We have 3 guesses left? 

   We need to guess a word that matches: 
        Position 1: L
        Position 2: I
        Position 3: ? (from available: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z)
        Position 4: E
        Position 5: ? (from available: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z)

   And it must be a valid English word? 

   We can try to think of words fitting ""LI_E_""

   Examples:
      ""LIKED"" -> but D is absent? 
      ""LITER"" -> T is absent? 
      ""LIBEL"" -> but we already know L is in first? and here L is also at last? but in ""lives"" we tested S? now we test B? 
          However, we don't know about B? 
          But pattern: ""LI_B E"" -> no? ""LIBEL"" is L I B E L -> so position 3 is B, position 5 is L? 
          But can we have two L's? It's possible? 
          Also, D is absent? 

      ""LIBEL"": L I B E L -> 
          Letters: L (twice), I, B, E.
          Absent letters: D? but B is not absent? 
          But we have absent: D is absent? but ""LIBEL"" doesn't have D? 
          So we can consider? 

      But in guess4, we tested V and S? That doesn't conflict? 

      However, we have two L's? In the secret word? 
      But we never tested a word with two L's? 

      Is it possible? 

      How would feedback work? 
      In ""piled"": we had only one L? and it was marked present but wrong position? 
      If the secret word had two L's? Then that L could be one of them? 
      But we don't know? 

      Now, we have the word ""LIBEL"": 
          Positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L.

      We don't know if L can be in position 5? 

      Alternatively, words without double L? 
        ""LIKE_"" -> but K is available? ""LIKE"" is 4 letters? 
        ""LIMEY"" -> L I M E Y -> avoids absent? 
           Position 3: M, Position 5: Y? 
        ""LINER"" -> N is absent? 
        ""LIBER"" -> B? but R absent? 
        ""LIMED"" -> D absent? 
        ""LIFER"" -> R absent? 

      ""LIMEY"": L I M E Y -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:M, 4:E, 5:Y.

      ""LIMBO"": L I M B O -> but pattern is LI_ E _? no, it doesn't have E in the fourth? unless ""LIMB O""? But ""LIMBO"" has E? No, it's L,I,M,B,O -> no E? 

      We need E in the fourth? So the word must end with E? only if there's a fifth letter? 

      Actually, the word is L I ? E ? -> so the last letter is the fifth? 

      So words: 
        ""L I ? E ?"" -> four letters in between? 

      We can list: 
        ""LIBER"" -> not, R absent? 
        ""LICET"" -> not a word? 

      ""LISLE"" -> but S is absent? 

      ""LITRE"" -> T absent? 

      So let's think: 
        ""LI E_"" ... no.

      The fourth letter is E? So after E, one letter? 

      Words like: 
        ""L I F E X"" -> ""LIFEX"" not a word? 
        ""L I F E B"" -> not a word? 
        ""L I B E X"" -> ""LIBEX"" not word? 
        ""L I B E L"" -> ""LIBEL"" (valid)

      ""L I V E S"" -> we tried ""LIVES"", but V and S absent? 

      ""L I K E S"" -> ""LIKES"": K is available? but S absent? 

      ""L I M E S"" -> ""LIMES"": M and S? S is absent? 

      ""L I M E ?"" -> without S? 
          ""LIMEY"" -> L I M E Y -> valid (meaning: a British person)

      So ""LIMEY"" is a valid word? 

      Also, ""LITRE"" is invalid because T absent? 

      ""LIBER"" invalid? 

      ""LIEGE"" -> L I E G E? But pattern: position 1:L,2:I,3:E? Oh, we need E at position 4? In ""LIEGE"", the E is in position 3 and 5? So not? 

      ""LIBER"" -> L I B E R -> then E is at position 4? and fifth is R? But R is absent? 

      So available words: 
         ""LIBEL"": L I B E L -> B at position 3? and L at 5? 
         ""LICE?"" -> no? 
         ""LIMEY"": L I M E Y -> M at 3, Y at 5? 
         ""LIFEY"" -> not a word? 
         ""LINEY"" -> N absent? 
         ""LIKEN"" -> N absent? 
         ""LIKED"" -> L I K E D -> D absent? 
         ""LIKE "" -> incomplete?

      Also, ""LIPES"" -> P and S absent? 

      And ""LIBER"" -> R absent? 

      So the only common words seem to be ""LIBEL"" and ""LIMEY"". 

      Since we have V and S absent, we can now use the available letters? 

      We can also try ""LIEVE"" -> not a standard word? 

      But we'll consider ""LIBEL"" and ""LIMEY"". 

      We have to choose one? 

      Let's see which gives more information? 

      ""LIBEL"": 
        - Tests B: in position 3? 
        - And tests L in position 5? (we already know L is present? 
        But if the secret word has L only once (in position 1), then position 5 L will be marked as absent? 
        Else if twice? then ✓? 

      ""LIMEY"": 
        - Tests M: in position 3? 
        - Tests Y: in position 5? 

      Since we haven't tested B, M, Y, etc., either is good? 

      But ""LIMEY"" has the advantage of using two new letters? 

      But we have one guess? Wait, we have 2 more guesses? 

      Actually, we have 4 guesses so far? and 6 total? So 2 left? 

      We can choose ""LIMEY"". 

      Also, consider: the secret word might not have two L's? So if we have ""LIMEY"", we avoid duplication? 

      Therefore, I choose ""LIMEY"". 

      Guess: ""limey""

   But wait: let's check feedback for ""limey""? 
      It has L in first (which is correct?), I second? M in third? E fourth? Y fifth? 

      So positions: 
        1: L -> should be ✓
        2: I -> ✓
        3: M -> if M in the word? if at third? ✓? 
        4: E -> ✓
        5: Y -> ?

      If the secret word is ""LIMEY"", all ✓. 
      If not, we get feedback on M and Y? 

      So we can then guess correctly in the last guess? 

      Therefore, we guess ""LIMEY"". 

   If there are other words? We might consider ""J"" or ""Q"", but not common? 

   But ""LIBEL"" is also a word? 

   Given two choices, we can also note that ""Y"" is a less common letter? 

   But I think ""LIMEY"" is acceptable? 

   Alternatively, ""LIKEN"" -> but N absent? 

   So final: guess ""LIMEY"" if it's in the word list? 

   We'll assume it is? 

   If not, we can pick ""LIBEL""? But let me see which is more common? 

   ""LIBEL"" is more common? But ""LIMEY"" is also an English word? 

   To be safe, we can try ""LIBEL""? 

   But note: in our available letters, we have not tested B? 

   But we are running out of guesses? We can only test one? 

   Given that we have 2 guesses left? 

   We can try ""LIBEL"" and if it doesn't work? Then we know? 

   But the secret word must be ""LIBEL"" or ""LIMEY""? 

   Wait, not necessarily? There might be other words? 

   Like: 
        L I F E R -> but R absent? 
        L I Z E R -> Z and R? 
        L I Z E ? -> ""LIZER"" not word? 

        L I B E M -> ""LIBEM"" not word? 

        L I M E D -> D absent? 

        L I K E S -> S absent? 

        L I M E S -> S absent? 

        L I M E B -> ""LIMEB"" not word? 

        L I M E C -> C absent? 

        L I K E N -> N absent? 

        L I B E S -> S absent? 

      ""L I F E "" ... 

      So perhaps ""LIBEL"" and ""LIMEY"" are the only ones? 

      Another: ""LINEN"" -> N absent? 

      ""LIKE?"" -> 

      ""LIRE?"" -> R absent? 

      So we have ""LIBEL"" and ""LIMEY""? 

      Also, ""LITH?"" -> no? 

      ""LIVID"" -> V absent? 

      So really, only two? 

      So we can try one? 

      We'll try ""LIMEY"". 

      Guess: ""limey""

   But note: the game rules: valid English words? 

   ""LIMEY"" is in the dictionary? 

   Yes, it means a British person? So valid? 

   Therefore, we guess ""LIMEY"".

<guess>limey</guess>### Consolidating Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - Absent: C, R, A, N  
   - E present but not in position 5.  
2. **Guess 2: ""eight""**  
   - E present but not in position 1.  
   - I correct in position 2 (fixed).  
   - Absent: G, H, T.  
3. **Guess 3: ""piled""**  
   - Absent: P, D.  
   - L present but wrong position (not position 3).  
   - E correct in position 4 (fixed).  
4. **Guess 4: ""lives""**  
   - L correct in position 1 (fixed).  
   - I correct (position 2, fixed).  
   - E correct (position 4, fixed).  
   - Absent: V, S.  

### Deductions:
- **Secret word pattern**: `L I ? E ?` (positions 1–5).  
  - Fixed: Position 1 = L, Position 2 = I, Position 4 = E.  
  - Missing: Position 3 and 5.  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D, V, S (exclude from guesses).  
- **Available letters**: B, F, J, K, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.  
- **No other present letters** → Positions 3 and 5 must be filled from available letters.  

### Strategy:
Test the highest-probability word fitting `L I _ E _` using common available letters.  
- **""LIMEY""** (valid English word meaning ""a British person""):  
  - Position 3: **M** (new test).  
  - Position 5: **Y** (new test).  
- If correct, ✓. If not, feedback on M/Y reduces options for the final guess.

But we don\'t know.\n\n   However, we want to avoid the fifth position for E because we know that the fifth letter is not E? \n   Actually, the feedback tells us that the fifth letter was not E in the secret word? \n   Our guess ""crane"" had E at the fifth, and it was marked as \'-\' meaning E is in the word but not at that spot. \n   So the fifth letter of the secret word is not E. Therefore, we should avoid putting E in the fifth again? \n   But we can put it again? It doesn\'t matter because we are trying to learn more.\n\n   However, we already know E is not in fifth? So we should try E in a different position.\n\n   Let\'s choose a word with E not in fifth and without C,R,A,N.\n\n   Words with E in position 1: \n      ELBOW -> letters: E, L, B, O, W -> avoids A,C,R,N?\n      ELITE -> E, L, I, T, E -> but we use E twice? And avoids C,R,A,N? \n          However, note: we don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s? So it\'s okay.\n\n   But let\'s look for words with more common letters.\n\n   Another common letter is T, so I might want to include T.\n\n   Word with E in second position? \n      ""TEETH"" -> E in second and fourth? But T is used twice? \n      But avoids A,C,R,N? \n          Also, we don\'t know about T? \n\n   We haven\'t tested T yet? So we can use T.\n\n   Common starting words with E and avoiding C,R,A,N: \n      ""SLATE"" -> S,L,A,T,E? But A is eliminated -> invalid.\n      ""ROAST"" -> has R and A -> invalid.\n\n   How about ""TOWEL"": T,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? But E is at the fourth position? And the fifth letter is L? \n\n   But note: we need words without A, R, N, C.\n\n   Another: ""BOWEL"": B,O,W,E,L -> avoids A,C,R,N? \n\n   But we also want to test more new letters.\n\n   Let\'s list available letters: we haven\'t used many.\n\n   We know E is present. We have used C,R,A,N,E (from first guess). \n\n   So available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\n   We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter in the secret word.\n\n   Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, S, T, L, O, I, ... but we already know E is there.\n\n   So include S, T, L, O.\n\n   How about a word that has E and S, T, L, O? Without using C,R,A,N.\n\n   Example: ""STOLE"" -> S,T,O,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        But note: ""STOLE"" has E at the end? We don\'t want to put E at the end? \n        Because we know the fifth letter is not E? \n        But we can use it to test other positions? \n\n        We are forced to put E somewhere? The feedback does not forbid E at the end? \n        We just know that it\'s not in the fifth position? So putting E at the end again would not help? \n        Because we already know E is present and not at the fifth? \n\n        However, the secret word might have E at more than one position? \n        We don\'t know. So by putting E at the end again, if the secret word has two E\'s? \n        Then we would get \'-\' for E again? \n\n        Alternatively, we might learn about other letters.\n\n   Since we have E present, we can try to place it in a different position to see where it goes.\n\n   Why not put E at the beginning? \n\n   Let me choose ""ELOPS"": but I\'m not sure if it\'s a valid word? \n\n   Alternatively, ""STOLE"" is valid? But E at the end is redundant? \n\n   Another word: ""HOMES"" -> H,O,M,E,S -> E is fourth? \n   Also, avoids A,C,R,N? \n\n   Or ""TIMES"": T,I,M,E,S -> E in fourth? \n\n   Or ""POISE"": P,O,I,S,E -> E in fifth? We avoid fifth? \n\n   Let\'s avoid E in fifth? \n\n   How about ""TILES"": T,I,L,E,S -> E in fourth? \n   But that\'s one letter? \n\n   Another idea: ""FLUID"", but no E? We must include E? Or we don\'t have to? \n   Actually, we don\'t have to include E? But note: the feedback only tells us that E is in the word? \n   But we have not confirmed where? So including E in a different position might help locate it.\n\n   However, if we don\'t include E, we might not get information about E? But we already know E is present? \n   So we can choose words without E? That might help test other letters? \n\n   The rules say we can guess any valid word? But strategically, we want to find the word quickly.\n\n   Since we know E is present, and we don\'t know its position, we should try E in a different position? \n\n   So I think we should put E in one of positions 1 to 4.\n\n   Let me choose a word with E in the first position: \n      ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. \n      This way, if E is in the first position, we get a ✓ for E? Otherwise, if E is not in first, but in the word, we get a \'-\'? \n\n   Alternatively, we can put E in a more common position? \n\n   Common positions for E: not at the end? Then in the middle? \n\n   According to feedback, E was at fifth and that was wrong? So E must be in 1,2,3,4.\n\n   We can also try E in the second position? \n\n   Let me pick a word with E in the second position and common letters: \n      ""BELLY"": B,E,L,L,Y -> but double L? \n      ""TEETH"": double E? \n      ""BESTI"": no.\n\n   How about ""METAL""? But A is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   ""LEMON"": but L,E,M,O,N? We have N? N is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   ""PETOS"": not a word? \n\n   Let me think: without A and N, and with E in second? \n      ""HELIO"" is not 5 letters? \n      ""DEUCE"" but D,E,U,C,E? C is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   Words with E in the third position: \n      ""CRUES"" -> C is eliminated -> invalid?\n      ""SPIEL"": S,P,I,E,L -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        E is fourth? Wait: S P I E L -> third letter I, fourth E? \n        We want E in third? \n\n   Actually: \n      ""GRUEL"" -> G,R,U,E,L? R is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   ""SUEDE"": S,U,E,D,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes. But E in third and fifth? \n        Fifth: we know E is not fifth? So we get \'-\' for third position? Or if the word has only one E? \n\n   This is getting messy.\n\n   Since we have eliminated only 4 letters (C,R,A,N) and have 22 left? \n\n   Let\'s choose a word that uses as many new letters as possible? And put E in a non-fifth position.\n\n   Example: ""SPIEL"" -> \n        letters: S, P, I, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n        E is in the fifth? Wait: \n            P-O-S-I-T-I-O-N: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E? Wait, it\'s S-P-I-E-L -> so E is fourth? \n            So E in fourth position? \n        Then fifth is L? \n        That\'s fine.\n\n   Or ""TOWED"": T,O,W,E,D -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fourth? \n\n   Or ""MOVIE"": M,O,V,I,E -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in fifth? We avoid? \n\n   So ""SPIEL"" sounds good: \n        S, P, I, E, L -> no duplicates? \n\n   We\'ll use that? \n\n   But note: we must be cautious: E is in fourth position? \n\n   What if the secret word has E in the first position? Then we would get S,P,I -> all absent? \n   And E as \'-\', L absent? That might not be informative? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a word that starts with E? \n\n   Let me look for a better word? \n\n   Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E at the end? We avoid? \n\n   ""STOLE"": E at the end? We avoid? \n\n   But we can try ""STEEL""? But not 5 distinct letters? \n\n   How about ""KELP""? Not 5 letters? \n\n   I think ""QUEST"": Q,U,E,S,T -> avoids A,C,R,N? Yes. E in third? \n        But Q is uncommon? \n\n   Let me go with ""SPIEL"". \n\n   So we guess ""SPIEL""? \n\n   But note: we might get more information.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""E"", in the first position? \n\n   Let me decide: \n\n   Option 1: ""ELTCH"" (not a word) -> no.\n\n   Option 2: ""EDGES"": E in first and fourth? Avoid C,R,A,N? Yes. Letters: E,D,G,E,S -> duplicates E? \n        If we guess it, the duplicate E might be confusing? \n        But the feedback will show: \n            First E: ✓ or -? \n            Fourth E? If the word has only one E and in the first? Then we get E(✓) and then E(x) for fourth? \n            Or if it also has E elsewhere? \n\n   But we don\'t know? \n\n   How about ""STOLE""? Even though E is at the end? We know the fifth letter is not E. \n        But if we put E at the end again, then the feedback for E will be \'-\', meaning E is present but not at fifth? \n        But we already know that? And we might learn about the other positions? \n\n        Actually, we haven\'t tested the fifth letter? We only know it\'s not E? So we can test other letters? \n\n        So ""STOLE"" has E at fifth? And we know it\'s not E? So we expect a \'-\' for E? \n        But we will learn about S,T,O,L: \n            If any of them are in the word? \n\n        However, we are testing S,T,O,L? \n\n        Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" tests S,P,I,E,L? \n\n        Either is fine? \n\n   Considering that E is already known to be present? Maybe we can avoid including E? \n\n   Actually, we have 5 guesses left? And we don\'t lose much? \n\n   However, we want to cover common letters? \n\n   Common letters: S, T, L, O, I are common? \n\n   So ""STOLE"" tests S,T,O,L,E? \n   But E at fifth: we expect a \'-\'? \n   Then we would get: \n        S at position 1 -> (✓ or - or x)\n        T at 2 -> similarly\n        O at 3 -> similarly\n        L at 4 -> similarly\n        E at 5 -> will be \'-\' (as expected)\n\n   Since we know E is present? Then regardless of other letters? \n\n   But we are testing 5 letters? With E being known? \n\n   Alternatively, I found a word: ""STILE"" (a type of ladder)? S,T,I,L,E -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        Also, E is at fifth? And we avoid fifth? \n\n   But note: we haven\'t tried words with E not at fifth? \n\n   Given that we already know E is present and not at fifth, we might try to find E\'s position by putting it in an early position? \n\n   Let me choose a word that starts with E? \n\n   Example: ""ELAND""? Has A? A is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n   ""EDGED""? Doubled E and D? \n\n   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n        E in first? \n        This tests E,I,G,H,T? \n\n   Also, ""INLET"": I,N,L,E,T -> has N? Eliminated? \n\n   ""EASEL""? has A and E doubled? \n\n   ""EVITE"": E,V,I,T,E -> avoid? \n\n   ""ETUDE"": E,T,U,D,E -> avoid duplicates? \n\n   ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes.\n\n        So ""EXIST"": E(1), X(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). \n        But T is at fifth? We don\'t know about T? \n\n   But note, we don\'t want to use fifth for E? But fifth here is T? \n\n   So ""EXIST"" has E at first? \n\n   I think ""EXIST"" or ""EIGHT""?\n\n   Commonality: S is more common than G and H? \n\n   So ""EXIST"": E,X,I,S,T -> it tests E at first? \n\n   We might get E(✓) if E is at first? \n\n   Otherwise, E(-) if E is elsewhere? \n\n   So let me choose a word like ""EXIST"".\n\n   We have to decide.\n\n   Given the above, I will choose ""EXIST"". \n\n   So our second guess: ""EXIST""\n\n   But let me see: \n        We avoid C,R,A,N? Yes: E,X,I,S,T doesn\'t have any of C,R,A,N.\n\n   So guess ""EXIST"".\n\n   Alternatively, if we want to avoid X? because X is rare? \n\n   Then ""MIDST"" -> M,I,D,S,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        But doesn\'t include E? Then we don\'t test E? \n        But we know E is present? So by not including E, we might get no feedback for E? \n        And then we don\'t learn about the position? \n        However, we will learn about these letters? \n\n        But if the word has E, and E is in ""MIDST"", we would not learn its position? \n\n        Actually, the feedback will still be: \n            If M is not in word -> x\n            I -> if in word and in position: ✓ or -? \n            D -> same\n            S -> same\n            T -> same\n\n        And if E is in the word? It doesn\'t come up? \n\n        So we don\'t get info on E? \n\n        That\'s bad because we know E is present? \n\n        We should include E? \n\n   Therefore, we must include E? \n\n   So I go with ""EXIST"" or ""SPIEL""? \n\n   After consideration, let me choose ""SPIEL"": \n        Reason: It includes E (but not fifth? fourth instead) and avoids C,R,A,N? \n        Also, letters S,P,I,E,L -> common letters? \n\n   We\'ll guess ""SPIEL"".\n\n   But note: position of E? In ""SPIEL"" the positions are: \n        1: S\n        2: P\n        3: I\n        4: E\n        5: L\n\n   So we are testing E in fourth? \n\n   If the secret word has E in fourth? We get ✓ for E? \n   Otherwise, if it has E elsewhere? Then \'-\' for E? \n\n   But let\'s hope we get some other hits? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word with E in the first? \n\n   Since we don\'t know? But time is short? \n\n   Another common word: ""POUND"" -> skip because we don\'t have E? \n\n   We must include E? \n\n   So ""QUEUE"" is not helpful? \n\n   Final: Guess ""SPIEL""\n\n   Or ""E"", first: ""ENTRY"" -> has N? and R? -> invalid.\n\n   ""EIGHT"": E,I,G,H,T -> avoids C,R,A,N? \n        And E in first? \n\n   I think ""EIGHT"" is a good word? \n\n   So I\'ll choose ""EIGHT""\n\n   Why? It tests E at position 1? And I,G,H,T? \n\n   We haven\'t tested G,H,T,I? \n\n   Common letters: I, T, H are common? \n\n   Let\'s do ""EIGHT""\n\n   So guess: ""EIGHT""\n\n   Second guess: ""eight""\n\n   But note: E is at first? \n\n   We expect if E is first, ✓. If not, then \'-\' because we know E is present? \n\n   But what if the secret word has no E at the first? Then we get \'-\' and we know E is in the word? \n\n   So this is acceptable.\n\n   We proceed with ""EIGHT"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked as ""x"").\n- E is in the secret word but **not in the 5th position** (marked as ""-"").\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word contains the letter E, located in positions 1–4.\n- The letters C, R, A, and N must be excluded from all subsequent guesses.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- We need to include E in a different position (anywhere except the 5th) to help identify its correct location.\n- Letters like T, I, G, and H are strong choices because they are common in English words and haven\'t been tested yet.\n- ""EIGHT"" aligns with these criteria: \n  - E is placed in position 1 (testing if E appears there).\n  - T, I, G, and H are new letters that maximize information gain.\n  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of E and test four additional common letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>eight</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning:\n  C, R, A, N are absent from the secret word.\n  E is present but not in the 5th position.\n\nGuess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)\nMeaning:\n  E is present but not in the 1st position (since we guessed it in the first position and got \'-\'). \n  I is present and in the correct position (2nd position, because in ""eight"", I is the second letter).\n  G, H, T are absent.\n\nSo from both guesses, we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T\nPresent letters: E (but not in 1st or 5th position) and I (which is in the 2nd position).\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n  - The second letter is I.\n  - The letter E is present, but not in the 1st, 2nd (because second is I), or 5th position. So E must be in the 3rd or 4th position.\n\nWe also know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.\n\nWe have 4 tries left.\n\nNow, we need to form a new guess that:\n  - Has 5 letters, all from the remaining possible letters (excluding absent ones).\n  - Must have I in the second position.\n  - Must include E in either the 3rd or 4th position (to check which one).\n  - Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.\n\nAvailable letters: \n  We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, G, H, T (from the two guesses). \n  But note: E and I are present, so they are still in play (but we know I is fixed at position 2).\n\n  The alphabet without the absent letters: \n    B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\n  And we know E must be included (but not in 1st, 2nd, or 5th) and I is fixed at position 2.\n\nSo the secret word pattern is: \n  Position 1: one of B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but not E, because E is not in 1st)\n  Position 2: I (fixed)\n  Position 3: either E or one of the available letters? But note: E must be in the word, and it can only be in 3rd or 4th. So either position 3 or 4 must be E.\n  Position 4: similarly, if E is not in 3rd, then it must be in 4th.\n  Position 5: one of the available letters (but not E, because E is not in 5th).\n\nWe can try to form a word that has I in the second position and E in the third position? Or in the fourth?\n\nWe should also try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s consider the possibilities:\n\nOption 1: Assume E is in the 3rd position -> pattern: _ I E _ _\nOption 2: Assume E is in the 4th position -> pattern: _ I _ E _\n\nWe don\'t know which, so we can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has E in the 3rd position and then if it\'s not there, we know it must be in the 4th? \n\nBut we can also choose a word that doesn\'t have E at all? But we must include E because we know it\'s present? \n\nWait, we must include E? Actually, we don\'t have to? But if we don\'t include E, then we won\'t get information about E\'s position? \n\nBut we know E is present? So if we don\'t include E, we will get all the other letters\' feedback, but we won\'t learn about E? \n\nHowever, we can still get the feedback for the letters we do include? \n\nBut we have limited guesses? So it\'s better to include E to try to locate it? \n\nSo let\'s include E in either the 3rd or 4th position? \n\nWe can choose a word that has E in the 3rd position? \n\nFor example: \n  Pattern: _ I E _ _\n\nWe need to fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions with available letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B,D,F,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nWe want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nCommon letters: S, L, O, P, D, etc.\n\nExample words: \n  ""SIEVE"" -> S I E V E -> but E is in 3rd and 5th? But we cannot have E in 5th? \n      Also, V is present? \n      But note: we are going to put E in 3rd? and 5th? But we know E is not in 5th? So we cannot use E in 5th? \n      So ""SIEVE"" is invalid because it has E in 5th? \n\n  ""SIEVE"" is not allowed? Because we know E is not in 5th? So we must avoid E in 5th? \n\n  ""DIET_"" -> but we need 5 letters? ""DIETS"" -> D I E T S -> but T is absent? T is eliminated? \n\n  ""LIEU_"" -> ""LIEUS"" (a word? meaning a unit of the French currency) -> L I E U S -> avoids absent letters? \n        Letters: L, I, E, U, S -> all allowed? \n        But E is in 3rd? \n        And no E in 5th? \n\n  ""BIELD"" (Scottish word for shelter) -> B I E L D -> avoids absent letters? \n        B, I, E, L, D -> all allowed? \n\n  ""PIECE"" -> P I E C E -> but C is absent? \n\n  ""FIELD"" -> F I E L D -> avoids absent letters? \n        F, I, E, L, D -> all allowed? \n\n  ""WIELD"" -> W I E L D -> same.\n\n  ""PIEZO"" -> P I E Z O -> avoids absent? \n\nBut note: we are not sure if these words are in the word list? \n\nAlternatively, we can try E in the 4th position? \n\nPattern: _ I _ E _\n\nExample: \n  ""SIRED"" -> S I R E D -> but R is absent? \n  ""FILED"" -> F I L E D -> avoids absent? \n        F, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? \n\n  ""MILER"" -> M I L E R -> R absent? \n  ""BIDES"" -> B I D E S -> avoids absent? \n\n  ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S -> avoids absent? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nWe can choose either pattern? \n\nBut we want to maximize information? \n\nWe know that E is either in 3rd or 4th? So if we choose a word with E in 3rd, we can test that hypothesis? \n\nIf we get E(✓) in 3rd, then we know E is in 3rd? \nIf we get E(-) in 3rd, then E is not in 3rd? So it must be in 4th? \n\nSimilarly, if we put E in 4th? \n\nSo either way, we can get the position? \n\nBut we also want to test other letters? \n\nSo let\'s choose a word that has E in 3rd and has common letters? \n\nI\'ll go with ""FIELD"": F I E L D -> \n  F: new letter\n  I: already known to be in second? so we expect ✓ for I? \n  E: in 3rd? we test if E is in 3rd? \n  L: new letter? \n  D: new letter? \n\nBut note: we are using F, L, D? \n\nAlternatively, ""WIELD"": W I E L D -> same? \n\nBut ""FIELD"" is more common? \n\nHowever, we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut we haven\'t seen any repeated letters so far? \n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has E in 3rd and also includes other common letters? \n\nBut we have limited letters? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has E in 4th? \n\nBut let\'s stick with E in 3rd? \n\nI choose ""FIELD"". \n\nBut wait: what if the secret word is ""FIELD""? Then we win? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nBut let\'s see: \n  If we guess ""FIELD"", and the secret word has E in 3rd? Then we get:\n      F: ? \n      I: ✓ (because second is I)\n      E: ✓ (if E is in 3rd) \n      L: ? \n      D: ?\n\n  If the secret word is ""FIELD"", then we get all ✓? \n\n  But if not, we get feedback on F, L, D? \n\n  Also, if E is not in 3rd, then we get E(-) meaning E is present but not in 3rd? Then we know E must be in 4th? \n\nSo it\'s a good test? \n\nBut note: we are using F, L, D? \n\nWe could use more common letters? \n\nCommon letters: S, O, L, D, etc. \n\nHow about ""SILED""? Not a common word? \n\n""OILED"": O I L E D -> avoids absent? \n        O, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? \n        But E is in 4th? \n\nBut we are testing E in 4th? \n\nWe can do that? \n\nBut we don\'t know if E is in 3rd or 4th? \n\nSo if we choose ""OILED"", we are testing E in 4th? \n\nIf we get E(✓) in 4th, then we know E is in 4th? \nIf we get E(-) in 4th, then E is not in 4th? So it must be in 3rd? \n\nSo both ""FIELD"" (E in 3rd) and ""OILED"" (E in 4th) are valid? \n\nBut we can only choose one? \n\nI think we should choose one that uses more common letters? \n\n""OILED"" has O, L, D? \n\n""FIELD"" has F, L, D? \n\nO is more common than F? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nAnother word: ""SIDLE"": S I D L E -> but E is in 5th? Not allowed? \n\n""QUIET"": Q U I E T -> T is absent? \n\n""JUICY"": J U I C Y -> C absent? \n\n""PILED"": P I L E D -> avoids absent? \n        P, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? \n        E in 4th? \n\n""PILED"" is a word? \n\nSimilarly, ""WIPED"": W I P E D -> avoids absent? \n\nBut we have to avoid T? \n\nI think ""PILED"" is a good choice? \n\nBut let me compare:\n\n  ""FIELD"": tests E in 3rd, and letters F, L, D? \n  ""PILED"": tests E in 4th, and letters P, L, D? \n\nWe already know I is in second? \n\nIn ""PILED"", the I is in second? So we expect I(✓). \n\nWe can choose either? \n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested S? S is a very common letter? \n\nSo maybe we should include S? \n\nPattern for E in 3rd: _ I E _ _ \n  With S: \n      Position 1: S -> ""SIE??"" \n      We need two more letters? \n      Example: ""SIEVE"" -> invalid because of E at the end? \n      ""SIEGE"" -> S I E G E -> but G is absent? \n      ""SIECE"" -> not a word? \n      ""SIELD"" -> not a word? \n      ""SIEUR"" -> S I E U R -> R is absent? \n\nPattern for E in 4th: _ I _ E _ \n  With S: \n      ""S I ? E ?"" \n      Example: ""SIRED"" -> R absent? \n      ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S -> avoids absent? \n          D is allowed? \n          But note: S is used twice? \n          Also, E is in 4th? \n          And fifth is S? \n          So ""SIDES"" -> S I D E S? \n          But we don\'t know if the word allows duplicates? \n\n      ""SINES"" -> S I N E S -> N is absent? \n      ""SILES"" -> not a word? \n      ""SITES"" -> T is absent? \n      ""SIVES"" -> not common? \n\n  ""SIXES"" -> S I X E S -> avoids absent? \n        But X is allowed? \n        And S is duplicated? \n\n  ""SIZES"" -> S I Z E S -> avoids absent? \n\nBut we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? \n\nThe rules don\'t say? But in Wordle, duplicates are allowed? \n\nBut in our feedback, we haven\'t seen any duplicates? \n\nBut the secret word might have duplicates? \n\nHowever, to be safe, we can avoid duplicates? \n\nSo ""SIDES"" is a word? And it has two S\'s? \n\nBut we are testing S in first and fifth? \n\nIf the secret word has only one S? Then we might get S(✓) and S(x) for the fifth? \n\nBut it\'s acceptable? \n\nBut we are not sure? \n\nAlternatively, without duplicates: \n\n  ""SIXES"" has two S\'s? \n\n  ""SIXTH"" -> T and H absent? \n\n  ""SIXTY"" -> T absent? \n\n  ""SILED"" -> S I L E D -> avoids absent? \n        S, I, L, E, D -> all allowed? \n        E in 4th? \n\n  ""SILED"" is a word? (past tense of sile: to descend, as a hawk) \n\n  But not common? \n\n  ""SIPED"" -> not a word? \n\n  ""SIMES"" -> not a word? \n\n  ""SIBYL"" -> S I B Y L -> avoids absent? \n        But no E? We must include E? \n\n  We must include E? \n\n  So ""SILED"" is acceptable? \n\n  But we are testing E in 4th? \n\n  Similarly, we can do ""SIDED"" -> but D repeated? \n\n  ""SIDED"" has two D\'s? \n\n  ""SIDLE"" -> S I D L E -> E in fifth? Not allowed? \n\nSo I think ""SILED"" is acceptable? \n\nBut to use common words, I\'ll avoid ""SILED"". \n\nAnother common word: ""DOILY"" -> no E? \n\nWe must include E? \n\nSo I think ""PILED"" is a common word? \n\nI\'ll go with ""PILED"": \n  P I L E D \n  This tests:\n      P in first? \n      I in second: ✓ (we know)\n      L in third? \n      E in fourth? \n      D in fifth? \n\n  If E is in fourth, we get E(✓) and then we know the position? \n  If E is not in fourth, we get E(-) meaning E is present but not in fourth? Then we know E must be in third? \n\n  Also, we test P, L, D? \n\n  So we get information on three new letters? \n\n  And we avoid the absent letters? \n\n  So I choose ""PILED"". \n\nBut note: we are testing E in the fourth position? \n\nAlternatively, we can test E in the third? \n\nBut we have to choose one? \n\nI think it\'s symmetric? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""PILED"". \n\nGuess: ""PILED""\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  We have not used P, L, D before? \n  And we avoid C,R,A,N,G,H,T? \n\nYes.\n\nSo <guess>piled</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C, R, A, N are absent (x), E is present but not in the 5th position (-).\n- **Guess 2: ""eight""** → E is present but not in the 1st position (-), I is correct and in the 2nd position (✓), and G, H, T are absent (x).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **I is fixed in the 2nd position** of the secret word.\n2. **E is present** but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since position 2 is I, and E was misplaced in positions 1 and 5). Thus, E must be in **position 3 or 4**.\n3. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T (cannot be used).\n4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test **E in the 4th position** to narrow down its location (if E is not in the 4th, it must be in the 3rd).\n- Include **new common letters** (P, L, D) to maximize information.\n- Use a valid word that fits the pattern `_ I _ E _` and avoids absent letters.\n\nThe word **""PILED""** is chosen because:\n- It places I in the 2nd position (✓, as required).\n- It tests E in the 4th position (if E is here, it will be ✓; if not, E must be in the 3rd).\n- It introduces three new common letters (P, L, D) to check for presence/position.\n- It avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, N, G, H, T).\n\n<guess>piled</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: piled -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) L(-) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n  Meaning: C, R, A, N are absent. E is present but not in the 5th position.\n\nGuess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)\n  Meaning: E is present but not in the 1st position. I is present and in the correct position (2nd). G, H, T are absent.\n\nGuess 3: ""piled"" -> P(x), I(✓), L(-), E(✓), D(x)\n  Meaning: P is absent. I is correct in the 2nd position (again). L is present but not in the 3rd position. E is present and in the correct position (4th). D is absent.\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate the information:\n\n1. Correctly positioned letters:\n   - I is in the 2nd position.\n   - E is in the 4th position.\n\n   So the secret word has the form: _ I _ E _\n\n2. Present letters but not in the guessed positions:\n   - E was previously marked as present but not in 1st (from guess2) and not in 5th (from guess1). Now we know it is in 4th (from guess3).\n   - L is present but not in the 3rd position (from guess3). Since the 4th position is E, L must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th? But wait, the word is _ I _ E _, so positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know:\n        Position 2: I\n        Position 4: E\n        So L is present and not in 3rd, so it must be in position 1 or 5? But note: we have only 5 positions.\n\n   However, we must consider that L could be in position 1 or 5? But we don\'t have a 5th position for L? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 5 are open? But we know position 3 was guessed as L in ""piled"" and it was marked as \'-\', meaning L is not in position 3. So L must be in position 1 or 5.\n\n3. Absent letters:\n   From all guesses: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D are absent.\n\n   So absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D.\n\n4. Present letters (including those correctly placed and misplaced):\n   - E (in position 4)\n   - I (in position 2)\n   - L (present, but not in position 3, so must be in 1 or 5)\n\n   Also, from guess1, we know E is present (and now we know it\'s in 4th). From guess2, I is present (in 2nd). From guess3, L is present (but not in 3rd).\n\n   So the secret word contains at least: I, E, L.\n\n   And we have two positions to fill: 1, 3, and 5? Actually, positions 1, 3, and 5 are unknown, but we know one of position 1 or 5 must be L? And the other two must be filled with letters that are not absent and not already known? \n\n   But note: the word has 5 letters. We have:\n        Position 1: ? (could be L or a new letter)\n        Position 2: I\n        Position 3: ? \n        Position 4: E\n        Position 5: ? \n\n   And we know L is present and not in 3, so it must be in 1 or 5.\n\n   Therefore, the word has L in either position 1 or 5, and the remaining two positions (if L is in 1, then positions 3 and 5; if L is in 5, then positions 1 and 3) must be filled with letters that are not absent and not I or E (which are already placed).\n\n   But note: the word might have more than one L? The feedback doesn\'t indicate that. In guess3, we had only one L (in position 3) and it was marked as \'-\', meaning that L is present but not there. It doesn\'t say anything about other L\'s? So it\'s possible that L appears again? But we don\'t know.\n\n   However, to be safe, we should consider that L might be only once? Or it might be twice? \n\n   But since we have limited information, we can assume for now that L appears only once? \n\n   Actually, the feedback for ""piled"" had only one L and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if there were two L\'s, we might have gotten two marks? But in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback will mark each occurrence appropriately? \n\n   For example, if the word has two L\'s and we guess one in the correct position and one in the wrong, we would get one ✓ and one -? But in this case, we only have one L in the guess and it was marked as \'-\', meaning that there is at least one L that is not in that position. It doesn\'t rule out the possibility of another L? \n\n   However, we don\'t have evidence of a second L? So we can proceed with the assumption that there is only one L? \n\n   Therefore, L must be in position 1 or 5.\n\n5. Available letters: \n   We have used: C,R,A,N,E,I,G,H,T,P,L,D (from the three guesses). \n   Absent: C,R,A,N,G,H,T,P,D -> so these cannot be used.\n   Present: E, I, L (and we know E and I are fixed, L is to be placed).\n\n   The remaining letters (not absent and not yet placed) are: \n        B, F, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\n   But note: we have to fill the positions 1, 3, 5, but one of them is L (if L is only once). \n\n   So the word must have L in either 1 or 5, and the other two positions from the available letters.\n\n   Also, the letter in position 3 must be one of the available letters (and not L, because if L is only once and we place it in 1 or 5, then position 3 cannot be L).\n\nNow, we need to form a guess that helps us determine:\n   - Where L is (position 1 or 5)?\n   - What are the letters in the remaining positions?\n\nBut note: we have two unknowns (if we consider L\'s position) and three positions? Actually, we have:\n\nCase 1: L in position 1 -> then the word is: L I ? E ? \n   Then positions 3 and 5 must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set (B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) and not L.\n\nCase 2: L in position 5 -> then the word is: ? I ? E L\n   Then positions 1 and 3 must be filled with two distinct letters from the available set.\n\nWe can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we can only test one word.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position 1 and then we see? Or in position 5? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nWe can also choose a word that doesn\'t include L? But we know L is present? So if we don\'t include L, we will get an \'x\' for L? But we know L is present? So that would be a waste? \n\nTherefore, we must include L? \n\nBut we don\'t know if L is in 1 or 5? \n\nSo we have to choose one? \n\nWe can choose a word that has L in position 1? Then if L is in 1, we get ✓ for L? If not, we get \'-\' meaning L is present but not in 1? Then we know L must be in 5? \n\nSimilarly, if we put L in 5, then if we get ✓ for L, it\'s in 5? If we get \'-\', then L is in 1? \n\nSo either way, we can determine L\'s position? \n\nBut we also want to test the other letters? \n\nSo let\'s choose a word that has L in position 1? \n\nThen the pattern: L I ? E ? \n\nWe need to fill positions 3 and 5 with available letters? \n\nWe want to use common letters? \n\nFor example: \n   Position 3: S (common)\n   Position 5: O (common) -> ""L I S E O"" -> not a word? \n\n   ""L I V E S"" -> but that\'s 5 letters? ""LIVES"" -> but V is available? \n\n   ""L I V E S"" is 5 letters: L, I, V, E, S -> but we have E in 4th? So ""L I V E S"" -> positions: \n        1: L\n        2: I\n        3: V\n        4: E\n        5: S\n\n   But the secret word has E in 4th? So that matches? \n\n   And ""LIVES"" is a word? \n\n   But note: we have to avoid absent letters? V and S are not in the absent list? \n\n   So ""LIVES"" is a candidate? \n\n   But what if the secret word is ""LIVES""? Then we win? \n\n   But we don\'t know? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common letters? \n\n   Another: ""L I K E S"" -> ""LIKES"" -> K is available? \n\n   ""LIKES"": L I K E S -> avoids absent? \n\n   But note: we are testing L in 1? \n\n   If L is not in 1, then we get L marked as \'-\'? meaning L is present but not in 1? Then we know L is in 5? \n\n   And we also test K and S? \n\n   So that\'s good? \n\n   But we have to consider that the secret word might have K? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in 5? \n\n   For example: "" ? I ? E L"" \n\n   Example: ""O I L E L"" -> but duplicate L? and O in first? \n\n   ""O I L E L"" is not a word? \n\n   ""S I Z E L"" -> S I Z E L -> ""SIZEL"" is not a word? \n\n   ""M I L E L"" -> not a word? \n\n   ""B I T E L"" -> not a word? \n\n   ""W I S E L"" -> not a word? \n\n   ""F I L E L"" -> not a word? \n\n   ""A I S L E"" -> but A is absent? \n\n   ""J I V E L"" -> ""JIVEL"" not a word? \n\n   ""V I E L L"" -> duplicate L? \n\n   It seems hard to find a word ending with ""IEL"" with E in the fourth? \n\n   Actually, the word is _ I _ E L -> so the last two letters are E and L? \n\n   Example: ""T I E L E"" -> but T is absent? \n\n   ""D I M E L"" -> D is absent? \n\n   ""B I K E L"" -> ""BIKEL"" not a word? \n\n   ""S I B E L"" -> ""SIBEL"" not common? \n\n   ""N I B E L"" -> N absent? \n\n   So it might be difficult to find a common word with L in the 5th? \n\n   Therefore, it might be more promising to assume L is in the 1st? \n\n   And we have words like ""LIVES"", ""LIKES"", etc. \n\n   But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? \n\n   Let me list words that fit the pattern for L in 1st: L I ? E ? \n\n   We have to fill the 3rd and 5th with letters from: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\n   Common words:\n      ""L I F E S"" -> ""LIFES"" not a word? \n      ""L I V E S"" -> ""LIVES"" (valid)\n      ""L I K E S"" -> ""LIKES"" (valid)\n      ""L I M E S"" -> ""LIMES"" (valid)\n      ""L I N E S"" -> but N is absent? \n      ""L I P E S"" -> P absent? \n      ""L I B E L"" -> ""LIBEL"" (valid) but note: L in first and fifth? \n          If we use ""LIBEL"", then we have L in first and fifth? \n          But we don\'t know if the word allows two L\'s? \n          And we have to consider: if the secret word has two L\'s? \n          In our feedback, we only know that there is at least one L (from guess3). \n          So ""LIBEL"" is a possibility? \n\n   But if we guess ""LIBEL"", then:\n        Position 1: L -> if L is in 1st, then ✓? \n        Position 2: I -> ✓\n        Position 3: B -> ?\n        Position 4: E -> ✓\n        Position 5: L -> if the secret word has L in 5th, then ✓? But if the secret word has only one L (in 1st), then we get L in 5th marked as absent? \n\n   But we don\'t know? \n\n   However, if the secret word has only one L (in 1st), then we would get:\n        L(✓) for first, and L(x) for fifth? \n        But we know L is present? So if we get L(x) for fifth, that means the fifth letter is not L? \n\n   But if the secret word has two L\'s, then we might get both? \n\n   But we don\'t have evidence of two L\'s? \n\n   So to avoid complexity, we can choose a word without duplicate L? \n\n   Therefore, ""LIVES"", ""LIKES"", ""LIMES"" are good? \n\n   Now, which one? \n\n   We want to test as many new letters as possible? \n\n   ""LIVES"": uses V and S? \n   ""LIKES"": uses K and S? \n   ""LIMES"": uses M and S? \n\n   V, K, M are all not tested? \n\n   We can choose one? \n\n   Since S is common, we can test S in the fifth? \n\n   But we don\'t know if S is in the word? \n\n   So I\'ll choose ""LIKES"" because K is less common? Or ""LIVES"" because V is less common? \n\n   Actually, we want to maximize the chance of hitting? \n\n   Common letters: S is more common than V, K, M? \n\n   So ""LIMES"" has M and S? \n\n   But we can also choose a word that has S in a different position? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose ""S"" in a position that might be in the secret word? \n\n   But we don\'t know? \n\n   I think ""LIVES"" is a good choice? \n\n   But note: we are also testing L in the first? \n\n   So I\'ll go with ""LIVES"". \n\n   Guess: ""LIVES""\n\n   If the secret word is ""LIVES"", we win? \n\n   If not, we get feedback on V and S? \n\n   And also, if L is not in first, we get L marked as \'-\'? \n\n   But we expect L to be in first? \n\n   Alternatively, if we get L marked as \'-\', then we know L is in fifth? \n\n   So we can then focus on words ending with L? \n\n   So it\'s a good test? \n\n   Therefore, we guess ""LIVES"". \n\nBut wait: what if the secret word has only one L and it is in the fifth? Then in ""LIVES"", we have L in first? \n   We would get: \n        L in first: marked as \'-\' (because L is present but not in first? and we know it must be in fifth? but we don\'t have L in fifth in the guess? so we get L marked as present but not in first? and then we know it must be in fifth? \n   And then we also get feedback on V and S? \n\n   So we can then make a next guess with L in fifth? \n\n   So it\'s acceptable? \n\n   We have 3 guesses left? \n\n   So I think it\'s a good move. \n\n   Let me count the guesses: we are about to make the 4th guess? \n\n   We have 3 guesses left? \n\n   So we can do it. \n\n   Therefore, we guess ""LIVES"". \n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters? V and S are not absent? \n\nYes.\n\nSo <guess>lives</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  \n   - C, R, A, N: Absent (x) → Excluded from future guesses.  \n   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → E is in the word, **not in position 5**.  \n\n2. **Guess 2: ""eight""**  \n   - E: Present but wrong position (-) → E is **not in position 1**.  \n   - I: Correct position (✓) → **I is in position 2**.  \n   - G, H, T: Absent (x) → Excluded.  \n\n3. **Guess 3: ""piled""**  \n   - P: Absent (x) → Excluded.  \n   - I: Correct position (✓) → Confirms **I in position 2**.  \n   - L: Present but wrong position (-) → **L is in the word, not in position 3**.  \n   - E: Correct position (✓) → **E is in position 4**.  \n   - D: Absent (x) → Excluded.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Secret word pattern**: `_ I _ E _` (positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  \n  - Position 2 = I (fixed).  \n  - Position 4 = E (fixed).  \n- **Present letters**: I, E, L.  \n  - L must be in **position 1 or 5** (since it can\'t be in position 3 and positions 2/4 are fixed).  \n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D (excluded).  \n- **Available letters**: B, F, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Test L in position 1** to resolve its location:  \n  - If L is in position 1, we get ✓.  \n  - If L is not in position 1, we get (-) → L must be in position 5.  \n- **Maximize new information**: Use common letters (S, V) in positions 3 and 5 to test their presence.  \n- **Optimal word**: **""LIVES""** fits perfectly:  \n  - `L` in position 1 (tests L\'s location).  \n  - `I` in position 2 (✓, confirmed).  \n  - `V` in position 3 (new letter).  \n  - `E` in position 4 (✓, confirmed).  \n  - `S` in position 5 (new letter).\n\n<guess>lives</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: piled -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) L(-) E(✓) D(x)\nGuess 4: lives -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from guess4: ""lives"" -> L(✓), I(✓), V(x), E(✓), S(x)\n\nThis means:\n- L is correct and in the first position.

Correctly placed letters:\n   - Position 1: L\n   - Position 2: I\n   - Position 4: E\n\n   So the secret word is: L I _ E _\n\n2. Absent letters:\n   From all guesses: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D, V, S are absent.\n   So absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D, V, S.\n\n3. Present letters:\n   We have L, I, E (all placed). \n   Additionally, from guess3: L was present (now placed at position1), and no other letters were indicated as present besides E (placed) and I (placed).\n   From guess4: V and S are absent.\n\n   But note: we might have missed other letters? Since we only have one unplaced position (position 3 and 5) and we don\'t have any other present letters indicated.\n\n   However, we know that the secret word must be 5 letters, and we have L, I, and E placed. So we are missing letters for positions 3 and 5.\n\n   We don\'t have any known present letter left? Because in guess3, we only had L marked as present (but not placed then) and now it\'s placed. In other guesses, no other present letters.\n\n   Therefore, the remaining two letters (position 3 and 5) must come from the available letters.\n\n4. Available letters (not absent and not used yet?):\n   We have excluded: C,R,A,N,G,H,T,P,D,V,S. So available: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z.\n\n   Since there are no known present letters left unplaced, the secret word\'s letters are L, I, E, and two letters from the available set.\n\n   The word pattern: L I ? E ?\n\n   We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""LI"", ends with ""E"", and the third and fifth letters are from B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z? But note: the fifth letter is after E? So the pattern is: L I ? E ? -> so fifth letter can be any available letter.\n\n   Actually, position 4 is E, so positions 3 and 5 are the unknowns.\n\n   We must fill position 3 and position 5 with any two distinct letters from the available set? Unless the word has double letters? But we don\'t know.\n\n   However, we haven\'t seen any double letters so far? \n\n5. Constraints from feedback:\n   In guess3: ""piled"" had L in position 3? and it was marked as \'-\'? But now we know L is in position 1? So that was consistent? And E was correctly placed at 4? Also, we had P and D absent.\n\n   In guess4: ""lives"" had V in position 3 and S in position 5? and they were absent? So we know the secret word\'s position 3 is not V? and position 5 is not S? \n\n   But V and S are now absent? So excluded.\n\n   We have 3 guesses left? \n\n   We need to guess a word that matches: \n        Position 1: L\n        Position 2: I\n        Position 3: ? (from available: B,F,J,K,M,O,Q,U,W,X,Y,Z)\n        Position 4: E\n        Position 5: ?

""LIBEL"" is L I B E L -> so position 3 is B, position 5 is L? \n          But can we have two L\'s?

That doesn\'t conflict? \n\n      However, we have two L\'s? In the secret word? \n      But we never tested a word with two L\'s? \n\n      Is it possible? \n\n      How would feedback work? \n      In ""piled"": we had only one L? and it was marked present but wrong position? \n      If the secret word had two L\'s? Then that L could be one of them? \n      But we don\'t know? \n\n      Now, we have the word ""LIBEL"": \n          Positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L.\n\n      We don\'t know if L can be in position 5? \n\n      Alternatively, words without double L? \n        ""LIKE_"" -> but K is available?

But R is absent? \n\n      So available words: \n         ""LIBEL"": L I B E L -> B at position 3? and L at 5? \n         ""LICE?"" -> no? \n         ""LIMEY"": L I M E Y -> M at 3, Y at 5? \n         ""LIFEY"" -> not a word? \n         ""LINEY"" -> N absent? \n         ""LIKEN"" -> N absent? \n         ""LIKED"" -> L I K E D -> D absent? \n         ""LIKE "" -> incomplete?\n\n      Also, ""LIPES"" -> P and S absent? \n\n      And ""LIBER"" -> R absent? \n\n      So the only common words seem to be ""LIBEL"" and ""LIMEY"". \n\n      Since we have V and S absent, we can now use the available letters? \n\n      We can also try ""LIEVE"" -> not a standard word? \n\n      But we\'ll consider ""LIBEL"" and ""LIMEY"". \n\n      We have to choose one? \n\n      Let\'s see which gives more information? \n\n      ""LIBEL"": \n        - Tests B: in position 3? \n        - And tests L in position 5?

Wait, we have 2 more guesses? \n\n      Actually, we have 4 guesses so far? and 6 total? So 2 left? \n\n      We can choose ""LIMEY"". \n\n      Also, consider: the secret word might not have two L\'s? So if we have ""LIMEY"", we avoid duplication? \n\n      Therefore, I choose ""LIMEY"". \n\n      Guess: ""limey""\n\n   But wait: let\'s check feedback for ""limey""? \n      It has L in first (which is correct?), I second? M in third? E fourth? Y fifth? \n\n      So positions: \n        1: L -> should be ✓\n        2: I -> ✓\n        3: M -> if M in the word? if at third? ✓? \n        4: E -> ✓\n        5: Y -> ?\n\n      If the secret word is ""LIMEY"", all ✓. \n      If not, we get feedback on M and Y? \n\n      So we can then guess correctly in the last guess? \n\n      Therefore, we guess ""LIMEY"". \n\n   If there are other words? We might consider ""J"" or ""Q"", but not common? \n\n   But ""LIBEL"" is also a word? \n\n   Given two choices, we can also note that ""Y"" is a less common letter? \n\n   But I think ""LIMEY"" is acceptable? \n\n   Alternatively, ""LIKEN"" -> but N absent? \n\n   So final: guess ""LIMEY"" if it\'s in the word list? \n\n   We\'ll assume it is? \n\n   If not, we can pick ""LIBEL""? But let me see which is more common? \n\n   ""LIBEL"" is more common? But ""LIMEY"" is also an English word? \n\n   To be safe, we can try ""LIBEL""? \n\n   But note: in our available letters, we have not tested B? \n\n   But we are running out of guesses? We can only test one? \n\n   Given that we have 2 guesses left? \n\n   We can try ""LIBEL"" and if it doesn\'t work? Then we know? \n\n   But the secret word must be ""LIBEL"" or ""LIMEY""? \n\n   Wait, not necessarily? There might be other words? \n\n   Like: \n        L I F E R -> but R absent? \n        L I Z E R -> Z and R? \n        L I Z E ? -> ""LIZER"" not word? \n\n        L I B E M -> ""LIBEM"" not word? \n\n        L I M E D -> D absent? \n\n        L I K E S -> S absent? \n\n        L I M E S -> S absent? \n\n        L I M E B -> ""LIMEB"" not word? \n\n        L I M E C -> C absent? \n\n        L I K E N -> N absent? \n\n        L I B E S -> S absent? \n\n      ""L I F E "" ... \n\n      So perhaps ""LIBEL"" and ""LIMEY"" are the only ones? \n\n      Another: ""LINEN"" -> N absent? \n\n      ""LIKE?"" -> \n\n      ""LIRE?"" -> R absent? \n\n      So we have ""LIBEL"" and ""LIMEY""? \n\n      Also, ""LITH?"" -> no? \n\n      ""LIVID"" -> V absent? \n\n      So really, only two? \n\n      So we can try one? \n\n      We\'ll try ""LIMEY"". \n\n      Guess: ""limey""\n\n   But note: the game rules: valid English words? \n\n   ""LIMEY"" is in the dictionary? \n\n   Yes, it means a British person?

We have the feedback from guess5: ""limey"" -> L(✓), I(✓), M(x), E(✓), Y(x)

This means:
- L is correct in position 1 (already known).
- I is correct in position 2 (already known).
- M is absent (x) from the secret word.
- E is correct in position 4 (already known).
- Y is absent (x) from the secret word.

Now, combining all feedback:

1. Correctly placed letters:
   - Position 1: L
   - Position 2: I
   - Position 4: E

   So the secret word is: L I _ E _

2. Absent letters:
   From all guesses: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D, V, S, M, Y are absent.
   So absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D, V, S, M, Y.

3. Available letters:
   The remaining letters are: B, F, J, K, O, Q, U, W, X, Z.

   We need to fill position 3 and position 5 with two distinct letters from this set? (unless the word allows duplicates, but we haven't seen any so far).

4. The word pattern: L I ? E ?

   We must find a 5-letter word that fits this pattern, using only the available letters for the two blanks.

   Let's list possible words:

   We have to use two letters from {B, F, J, K, O, Q, U, W, X, Z} for positions 3 and 5.

   Examples:

   - ""LIBEL"": But we have B? and L? But note: ""LIBEL"" has L at the end? But we already have L at the beginning? 
        However, we haven't tested B? 
        But in ""LIBEL"", the pattern: L I B E L -> so position 3 is B, position 5 is L.
        But we know L is present? and we have L at position 1? 
        But is it possible to have two L's? 
        We don't have evidence against it? 
        But we have to check if L is allowed twice? 

        However, in the feedback, we never had a duplicate? 

        But the rules allow duplicates? 

        So ""LIBEL"" is a candidate? 

        But we have to check if B is available? Yes, B is not absent? 

        So ""LIBEL"" uses B and L? 

        But we already know L is in the word? So if we have two L's? 

        We can test it? 

   - Other words? 

   - ""LIKE"": but we need 5 letters? ""LIKE"" is 4? 

   - ""LIKEN"": but N is absent? 

   - ""LIFER"": R absent? 

   - ""LITER"": T absent? 

   - ""LITRE"": T absent? 

   - ""LIBER"": R absent? 

   - ""LICEY"": but C and Y absent? 

   - ""LIMEY"": we tried? 

   - ""LIEVE"": not a word? 

   - ""LIFED"": D absent? 

   - ""LIKED"": D absent? 

   - ""LIKES"": S absent? 

   - ""LIMES"": S and M absent? 

   - ""LINEY"": N and Y absent? 

   - ""LINKY"": N and K? K is available? but ""LINKY"" is not a common word? 

   - ""LIBEX"": not a word? 

   - ""LIBRA"": R and A absent? 

   - ""LIGER"": G and R absent? 

   - ""LIKER"": R absent? 

   - ""LIVED"": V and D absent? 

   - ""LIVES"": V and S absent? 

   - ""LIVID"": V and D absent? 

   - ""LIZZY"": Z? but ""LIZZY"" is not matching the pattern? It has Z at position 3 and 4? 

        Pattern: L I ? E ? -> so position 3 must be a letter, and position 5 must be a letter? 

        ""LIZZY"": L I Z Z Y -> but position 4 is Z? not E? 

   - ""LIZ E?"" -> ""LIZES"": S absent? 

   - ""LIZER"": not a word? 

   - ""LIKIN"": N absent? 

   - ""LIKIN"" is not? 

   - ""LIKED"": D absent? 

   - ""LIKES"": S absent? 

   - ""LIKEO"": not a word? 

   - ""LIKEO"" -> not? 

   - ""LIKUT"": K and U? but T absent? 

   - ""LIKUT"" not a word? 

   - ""LIKON"": N absent? 

   - ""LIKOF"": not a word? 

   - ""LIKOP"": P absent? 

   - ""LIKOW"": not a word? 

   - ""LIKUZ"": not a word?

   - ""LIKER"": R absent? 

   - ""LIKES"": S absent? 

   - ""LIKIN"": N absent? 

   - ""LIKED"": D absent? 

   - ""LIKUT"": T absent? 

   So we are left with ""LIBEL"" as a candidate? 

   But what about ""LIFEX""? not a word? 

   ""LIFER"" -> R absent? 

   ""LIFEY"" -> Y absent? 

   ""LIFEW"" -> not a word? 

   ""LIFEK"" -> not? 

   ""LIFEJ"" -> not? 

   ""LIFE"" ... 

   ""LIFEB"" -> not? 

   ""LIFEB"" is not a word? 

   ""LIFER"" is a word? but R absent? 

   So no? 

   What about ""L I B E F""? ""LIBEF"" not a word? 

   ""L I B E K""? ""LIBEK"" not? 

   ""L I B E W""? ""LIBEW"" not? 

   ""L I B E O""? ""LIBEO"" not? 

   ""L I B E Q""? ""LIBEQ"" not? 

   ""L I B E U""? ""LIBEU"" not? 

   ""L I B E X""? ""LIBEX"" not? 

   ""L I F E B""? ""LIFEB"" not? 

   ""L I J E B""? ""LIJEB"" not? 

   ""L I K E B""? ""LIKEB"" not? 

   ""L I O E B""? ""LIOEB"" not? 

   ""L I Q E B""? ""LIQEB"" not? 

   ""L I U E B""? ""LIUEB"" not? 

   ""L I W E B""? ""LIWEB"" not? 

   ""L I X E B""? ""LIXEB"" not? 

   ""L I Z E B""? ""LIZEB"" not? 

   So the only candidate we have is ""LIBEL""? 

   Therefore, the secret word must be ""LIBEL"". 

   We have one guess left? 

   So we guess ""LIBEL"". 

   But note: in ""LIBEL"", we have L at position 1 and 5? 

   We haven't tested B? 

   But we have no other options? 

   So we go with ""LIBEL"". 

   Guess: ""libel""

   If it's not, then we lose? 

   But we have no other words? 

   Alternatively, we might have missed a word? 

   Let me think: 
        L I ? E ? 

        We have available: B, F, J, K, O, Q, U, W, X, Z.

        We need a word? 

        ""L I F E W"" -> not a word? 

        ""L I K E W"" -> not? 

        ""L I K E O"" -> not? 

        ""L I K E U"" -> not? 

        ""L I K E X"" -> not? 

        ""L I K E Z"" -> not? 

        ""L I B E F"" -> not? 

        ""L I B E J"" -> not? 

        ""L I B E K"" -> not? 

        ""L I B E O"" -> not? 

        ""L I B E Q"" -> not? 

        ""L I B E U"" -> not? 

        ""L I B E W"" -> not? 

        ""L I B E X"" -> not? 

        ""L I B E Z"" -> not? 

        ""L I J E F"" -> not? 

        ""L I J E K"" -> not? 

        ""L I J E O"" -> not? 

        ""L I J E W"" -> not? 

        ""L I J E X"" -> not? 

        ""L I J E Z"" -> not? 

        ""L I K E F"" -> not? 

        ... 

        So no other words? 

        Therefore, ""LIBEL"" is the only possibility? 

        So we guess ""LIBEL"". 

   But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? 

   In ""LIBEL"", we have two L's? 

   How would the feedback be? 

   We have L in position 1: ✓ (we know) 
   L in position 5: if the secret word has L in position 5? then ✓? 

   But if the secret word has only one L? then position 5 L would be marked as absent? 

   But we know L is present? and we have it in position 1? 

   So if the secret word has only one L, then position 5 L would be marked as absent? 

   But in our feedback for ""limey"", we didn't have any indication of duplicate letters? 

   But we don't know? 

   However, we have no other candidate? 

   So we must try ""LIBEL"". 

   Therefore, the guess is ""libel"". 

<guess>libel</guess>### Final Deduction:
- **Secret word pattern**: `L I _ E _` (positions 1–5).  
  - Fixed: L (pos1), I (pos2), E (pos4).  
  - Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D, V, S, M, Y.  
  - Available letters for positions 3 and 5: **B, F, J, K, O, Q, U, W, X, Z**.  

### Analysis:
- After testing ""limey"" (M and Y absent), no common words fit `L I _ E _` except **""LIBEL""**.  
  - ""LIBEL"" uses **B** (available) and **L** (already confirmed in pos1).  
  - Position 5 = L is valid (duplicate letters allowed).  
- No other valid English words match the pattern with remaining letters.  

### Final Guess:
**""LIBEL""** is the only feasible option.

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `L I _ E _` (positions 1–5).  
  - Fixed: Position 1 = L, Position 2 = I, Position 4 = E.  
  - Missing: Position 3 and 5.  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D, V, S, M, Y (excluded).  
- **Available letters**: B, F, J, K, O, Q, U, W, X, Z.  
- **No other words fit the pattern** except **""LIBEL""**:  
  - `L I B E L` uses **B** (available) and **L** (duplicate allowed).  
  - All other combinations (e.g., with F, J, K, O, etc.) yield invalid words.  

### Final Guess:
**""LIBEL""** is the only valid English word matching the pattern and constraints.  

<guess>libel</guess>",libel,"We have the feedback from guess5: ""limey"" -> L(✓), I(✓), M(x), E(✓), Y(x)

This means:
- L is correct in position 1 (already known).
- I is correct in position 2 (already known).
- M is absent (x) from the secret word.
- E is correct in position 4 (already known).
- Y is absent (x) from the secret word.

Now, combining all feedback:

1. Correctly placed letters:
   - Position 1: L
   - Position 2: I
   - Position 4: E

   So the secret word is: L I _ E _

2. Absent letters:
   From all guesses: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D, V, S, M, Y are absent.
   So absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, P, D, V, S, M, Y.

3. Available letters:
   The remaining letters are: B, F, J, K, O, Q, U, W, X, Z.

   We need to fill position 3 and position 5 with two distinct letters from this set? (unless the word allows duplicates, but we haven't seen any so far).

4. The word pattern: L I ? E ?

   We must find a 5-letter word that fits this pattern, using only the available letters for the two blanks.

   Let's list possible words:

   We have to use two letters from {B, F, J, K, O, Q, U, W, X, Z} for positions 3 and 5.

   Examples:

   - ""LIBEL"": But we have B? and L? But note: ""LIBEL"" has L at the end? But we already have L at the beginning? 
        However, we haven't tested B? 
        But in ""LIBEL"", the pattern: L I B E L -> so position 3 is B, position 5 is L.
        But we know L is present? and we have L at position 1? 
        But is it possible to have two L's? 
        We don't have evidence against it? 
        But we have to check if L is allowed twice? 

        However, in the feedback, we never had a duplicate? 

        But the rules allow duplicates? 

        So ""LIBEL"" is a candidate? 

        But we have to check if B is available? Yes, B is not absent? 

        So ""LIBEL"" uses B and L? 

        But we already know L is in the word? So if we have two L's? 

        We can test it? 

   - Other words? 

   - ""LIKE"": but we need 5 letters? ""LIKE"" is 4? 

   - ""LIKEN"": but N is absent? 

   - ""LIFER"": R absent? 

   - ""LITER"": T absent? 

   - ""LITRE"": T absent? 

   - ""LIBER"": R absent? 

   - ""LICEY"": but C and Y absent? 

   - ""LIMEY"": we tried? 

   - ""LIEVE"": not a word? 

   - ""LIFED"": D absent? 

   - ""LIKED"": D absent? 

   - ""LIKES"": S absent? 

   - ""LIMES"": S and M absent? 

   - ""LINEY"": N and Y absent? 

   - ""LINKY"": N and K? K is available? but ""LINKY"" is not a common word? 

   - ""LIBEX"": not a word? 

   - ""LIBRA"": R and A absent? 

   - ""LIGER"": G and R absent? 

   - ""LIKER"": R absent? 

   - ""LIVED"": V and D absent? 

   - ""LIVES"": V and S absent? 

   - ""LIVID"": V and D absent? 

   - ""LIZZY"": Z? but ""LIZZY"" is not matching the pattern? It has Z at position 3 and 4? 

        Pattern: L I ? E ? -> so position 3 must be a letter, and position 5 must be a letter? 

        ""LIZZY"": L I Z Z Y -> but position 4 is Z? not E? 

   - ""LIZ E?"" -> ""LIZES"": S absent? 

   - ""LIZER"": not a word? 

   - ""LIKIN"": N absent? 

   - ""LIKIN"" is not? 

   - ""LIKED"": D absent? 

   - ""LIKES"": S absent? 

   - ""LIKEO"": not a word? 

   - ""LIKEO"" -> not? 

   - ""LIKUT"": K and U? but T absent? 

   - ""LIKUT"" not a word? 

   - ""LIKON"": N absent? 

   - ""LIKOF"": not a word? 

   - ""LIKOP"": P absent? 

   - ""LIKOW"": not a word? 

   - ""LIKUZ"": not a word? 

   - ""LIKWA"": not a word? 

   - ""LIKBE"": not a word? 

   - ""LIKEE"": not a word? 

   - ""LIKEN"": N absent? 

   - ""LIKER"": R absent? 

   - ""LIKES"": S absent? 

   - ""LIKIN"": N absent? 

   - ""LIKED"": D absent? 

   - ""LIKUT"": T absent? 

   So we are left with ""LIBEL"" as a candidate? 

   But what about ""LIFEX""? not a word? 

   ""LIFER"" -> R absent? 

   ""LIFEY"" -> Y absent? 

   ""LIFEW"" -> not a word? 

   ""LIFEK"" -> not? 

   ""LIFEJ"" -> not? 

   ""LIFE"" ... 

   ""LIFEB"" -> not? 

   ""LIFEB"" is not a word? 

   ""LIFER"" is a word? but R absent? 

   So no? 

   What about ""L I B E F""? ""LIBEF"" not a word? 

   ""L I B E K""? ""LIBEK"" not? 

   ""L I B E W""? ""LIBEW"" not? 

   ""L I B E O""? ""LIBEO"" not? 

   ""L I B E Q""? ""LIBEQ"" not? 

   ""L I B E U""? ""LIBEU"" not? 

   ""L I B E X""? ""LIBEX"" not? 

   ""L I F E B""? ""LIFEB"" not? 

   ""L I J E B""? ""LIJEB"" not? 

   ""L I K E B""? ""LIKEB"" not? 

   ""L I O E B""? ""LIOEB"" not? 

   ""L I Q E B""? ""LIQEB"" not? 

   ""L I U E B""? ""LIUEB"" not? 

   ""L I W E B""? ""LIWEB"" not? 

   ""L I X E B""? ""LIXEB"" not? 

   ""L I Z E B""? ""LIZEB"" not? 

   So the only candidate we have is ""LIBEL""? 

   Therefore, the secret word must be ""LIBEL"". 

   We have one guess left? 

   So we guess ""LIBEL"". 

   But note: in ""LIBEL"", we have L at position 1 and 5?
