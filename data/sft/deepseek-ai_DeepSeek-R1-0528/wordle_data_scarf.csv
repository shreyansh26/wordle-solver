We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

Okay, analysing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

- C: marked with (-), meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position
- R: also (-), so R is present but not in the second position
- A: (✓) confirms A is correct and in the third position
- N: (x) not present in the word at all
- E: (x) also not present

Key insights about the secret word:
- Contains letters: C, R, and A (definitely)
- Does NOT contain: N, E
- A is fixed in the third position: _ _ A _ _
- C and R are present somewhere, but C isn't first and R isn't second

Considering the absent letters (N,E), I'll avoid words containing these. Need a new word incorporating C, R, A with A in third position. 

Possible approach: Position C and R in new spots:
- Since C was first but wrong position, it must be elsewhere (positions 2/4/5)
- R was second but wrong position, so elsewhere (1/4/5)

Good candidate words: 
Try ""TRACK"" - but contains K which is unknown, and double C might be issue? Wait, ""crane"" had single C so secret likely has one C.
Better to try ""CART_S"" but 5 letters only.

Alternative: ""CARES"" - but E is invalid (absent). 
""CHAIR"" - contains H and I which weren't tested.
Optimal: Include untested common consonants (S,T,L) while repositioning C/R.

Select ""SCRAP"": 
- Puts C in second position (was wrong in first), R in third? Wait no - A is fixed third so R can't be third. 
Positioning: S _ A _ ? 
But R needs placement - could be first or fourth. 

Better word: ""CRASH""? 
- Positions: C1 (but feedback said C not first), R2 (wrong too), A3 (correct) 
Problem: Puts C and R in same wrong positions again. 

Alternatively: ""TRACE"" - but E is absent. 
New idea: Start with new letter, place C/R later. 

Try ""PARCS""? Not a word. 

Valid options: 
- ""SCARE"": S first, C second, A third (✓), R fourth? 
""SCARE"" structure: 
Position1: S (new)
Position2: C (previously wrong in pos1, so possibly correct here)
Position3: A (fixed ✓)
Position4: R (previously wrong in pos2)
Position5: E? But E is absent - invalid. 

Therefore avoid E. Try ""SCARF"" or ""SCARY"" but Y may be less common. 

Better: ""CARGO"" - checks G and O which weren't tested. 
Breakdown: C1 (wasn't pos1 before? Wait feedback: C was first and marked wrong position, so cannot be pos1 again). 

Thus: Must not have C in first position. 

Strong candidate: ""TRACK"" - but T is new, positions: T1, R2 (wrong position?), A3(✓), C4, K5. 
Recall R was position2 before and marked wrong - but perhaps it could be position2 in secret? No: (-) means present but not in that position. So R cannot be position2. 

Therefore in ""TRACK"": 
- T: new 
- R position2: but feedback says R not in position2 -> invalid placement. 

Revised criteria: Secret must have R not in position2, C not in position1. 

Possible words: 
- ""PARTY"" but Y untested and absent? 
- ""FANCY"" - but N absent and C in wrong position? 
No N, so exclude. 

Optimal choice: ""SCRUB""? Too many unknowns. 

Common word: ""PLACE"" - but E absent. 

Another: ""MARCH"" - M1, A2? Wait A must be third. 

Correct pattern: _ _ A _ _ 

After trial, ""OCTAD""? Uncommon. 

Suitable word: ""CRUMB"" but M/B untested. 

Best practical option: ""CRWTH""? Invalid word. 

Found: ""SCALP""
- S1 (new)
- C2 (C was first previously, now position2: distinct placement)
- A3 (✓)
- L4 (new letter)
- P5 (new)

Also tests S,L,P which weren't in first guess. 

Or ""SCAMP"" - similar. 

Between ""SCALP"" and ""SCAMP"", both work. I'll choose ""SCALP"" as more common. 

Confirming: Secret contains C,R,A. ""SCALP"" has S,C,A,L,P. Missing testing R explicitly? Not exactly, since we know R must be present but not positioned. ""SCALP"" doesn't test R - problem. 

Ideally need a word that includes R. 

Alternative: ""CAROM""? But O may be present? First guess E absent, N absent - O untested. 

Better: ""CARTS""
- C1: invalid (feedback says C not in pos1)
Cannot use C in pos1. 

Solution: Place R in position1? That's possible. 

So try ""RAXES"" but E,S might conflict? E absent. 

Strong candidate: ""ROACH"" - but contains O (unknown) and H (unknown), while E absent? Actually R1 O2 A3(✓) C4 H5. 
Position: R is now position1 - which wasn't position2 before? Feedback didn't forbid position1. Previously R was position2 and marked wrong, so it could be position1? 

Yes: (-) only forbids the position tried, not others. 

Thus ""ROACH"" possible: 
- R1: not position2 (complies)
- O2: untested
- A3: ✓
- C4: C was position1 before, now position4 (valid new position)
- H5: untested

Also tests O,H. 

Downside: Contains no common consonants beyond R,A,C. 

Another candidate: ""TRACK"" was invalid due to R position. Instead ""RACKS"": 
- R1 (new position)
- A2? But A must be third. 
Must have A at third. 

Thus viable words: 
- ""F R A C X"" with two middle letters? 
Pattern: positions 1,2,4,5 to fill with A fixed at third. 
Must include R and C somewhere not in forbidden positions (R not pos2, C not pos1). 

Perfect word: ""TRACT"" - but T and C? Position: T1, R2 (invalid position for R), A3✓, C4, T5? 
R position2 forbidden. 

Alternative: ""BRACT"" - B1, R2? Again R pos2 invalid. 

Solution: Avoid position2 for R. 

Try ""CRAFT"" - C1 is forbidden. 

Ah, use letter for position1 that isn't C or R? 

Word suggestion: ""WRACK"" - W1, R2? Pos2 invalid. 

Success: ""PARCS"" invalid. 

How about ""LATCH"": L1, A2? No, A must be third. 
Correct: L1, _2, A3✓, T4, H5? 

Then need to include R and C? Not necessarily - secret has R and C but we must test around A. 

Perhaps ""AUDIO"" - invalid since A must be third. 

After screening, good option: ""PIANO"" won't work due to N absent and A position. 

Rebuild: Start with R in position1 and C in position4/5? 

Word: ""RANCH"" - but N absent. Excluded. 

""GRACE"" - E absent. 
""TRACE"" - E absent. 

Found valid words: 
- ""CRWTH"" invalid
- ""SPRIG"" but R position3? And positions: S1, P2, R3 (allowed, since R wasn't position3 before), I4, G5. But A is fixed at third - conflict! Position3 must be A, but R is placed there? Impossible. 

Therefore position3 is always A for the secret. 

So words must be: X Y A Z W 

Where R must be in X/Y/Z/W, but not Y (position2) 
C must be in X/Y/Z/W, not X (position1) 

Additionally, X,Y,Z,W ≠ N or E. 

Potential guess: ""SHAKE"" - contains E, invalid. 

Better: ""STACK"": 
- S1 (new)
- T2 (new)
- A3 (✓)
- C4 (C was pos1 before, now pos4 - new valid position)
- K5 (new)

But misses testing R? We know R is present but not tested? 
Problem: We need to confirm R's position. 

Prioritize including R: 
Guess ""S_ _ A R"" with something? 

Try ""SOAR_X"" - but 5 letters only. 

Valid word: ""SCARB""? Not word. 
""SCARE"" invalid due to E. 

""SCARF"": 
- S1
- C2 (new position)
- A3✓
- R4 (was position2 before, now position4 - valid new placement)
- F5 

This tests R explicitly and places C at position2. 
Also tests S,F at positions1/5. 

""SCARF"" seems perfect: 
- Tests that C is at position2 now (if correct, we'll get ✓ for C)
- Tests that R is at position4 (same logic)
- Introduces S and F 

If wrong, feedback will help narrow further. 

Therefore, second guess: ""SCARF"" 

But confirming: Does this comply? 
Feedback: 
- C was previously position1 with (-) meaning in word but wrong position. Here C is now position2 - if secret has C there, it will be ✓; else if still wrong? Then another (-), etc. 
- Similarly R: was position2, now position4. 

Valid English word? Yes. 

Final choice: SCARF 

<guess>scarf</guess>

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C**: `(-)` → In secret word, but *not* in position 1.
- **R**: `(-)` → In secret word, but *not* in position 2.
- **A**: `(✓)` → Correctly placed in position 3.
- **N**: `(x)` → Not in secret word.
- **E**: `(x)` → Not in secret word.

The secret word:
- Must include **C**, **R**, and **A**.
- Must *not* include **N** or **E**.
- **A** is fixed in **position 3** (pattern: `_ _ A _ _`).
- **C** cannot be in position 1, and **R** cannot be in position 2.

For the second guess:
- Need to test new positions for C and R while keeping A in position 3.
- Avoid words with N or E.
- Include new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, F).

Selected **SCARF**:
- **S** (position 1): Untested letter (new).
- **C** (position 2): Previously in wrong position 1; tests if it fits here.
- **A** (position 3): Correct and fixed.
- **R** (position 4): Previously in wrong position 2; tests new placement.
- **F** (position 5): Untested letter (new).

This guess efficiently positions the known letters correctly and introduces new information with S and F.
