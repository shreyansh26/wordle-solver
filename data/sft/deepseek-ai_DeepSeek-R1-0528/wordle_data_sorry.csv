We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word because it has three common consonants and two vowels.

I need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically:
- Uses common letters (vowels and frequent consonants)
- Avoids repeating letters
- Covers multiple common positions

The word ""CRANE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- All letters are unique
- It covers frequent letter positions (e.g., C often starts words, E often ends words)
- It's a valid English word

This choice will provide clear feedback on several high-frequency letters, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) - C is not in the secret word.
R(-) - R is in the secret word but not in the second position (since we guessed R in the second position and it was marked as in the word but wrong position).
A(x) - A is not in the secret word.
N(x) - N is not in the secret word.
E(x) - E is not in the secret word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, E are NOT in the secret word.

Since R is in the word but not in the second position, it must be in one of the other positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need to make a new 5-letter guess that:
- Includes R (because it's in the word), but not in the second position.
- Avoids using C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Should try to test other common letters to gather more information.

Common English letters: After vowels (A, E are out), other vowels: O, I, U. Also common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

Potential letters to use: Since we know R is present, let's consider words that have R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We also need to avoid positions that might conflict. But since R's position is unknown, we can try placing it in a different spot.

Moreover, we should aim for a word that uses other high-frequency letters that we haven't tested yet. We haven't tested: O, I, U, S, T, L, D, H, M, etc.

A good approach might be to pick a word with R in a new position and several new common letters.

Let me brainstorm some words:

- Since R cannot be in position 2, let's try putting R in position 1: words like ""RO..."". But R might be in 3,4, or 5 as well.

To maximize information, perhaps we can avoid putting R in position 2 and try it elsewhere.

Possible words: 
- Start with R?: ""ROTIS"", but isn't a word. 
- Valid words: ""ROAST"" - but has A (which is eliminated), and S and T are new.

But A is out, so we can't use ROAST.

Similarly, ""ROUTE"" has E which is out.

What about ""ROUND""? Has R in 1st, O, U, N, D. But N is eliminated? Wait, feedback said N(x) so N is not in the word. So ROUND has N? So we cannot use N? Yes, since N(x) from first guess.

Similarly, E is out, so we need a word without C,A,N,E.

Available letters: we can use consonants like B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But focus on high frequency.

Vowels: O, I, U (since A and E are out).

So, possible word with R: let me think of common words.

Option: ""POURS"" - P, O, U, R, S. But R is in the 4th position? Positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:S. So R is in position 4. And we avoid position 2 for R? Yes, because R was in position 2 in first guess and was wrong position.

But does ""POURS"" exist? Yes.

Other options: ""TOURS"" - T,O,U,R,S. Similarly R in position 4.

Or ""GROUP"" - G,R,O,U,P - R in position 2? But we cannot put R in position 2 because we already know it's not there. Feedback: R was in position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position, so we must avoid putting R in position 2 again? Actually, we can put it elsewhere, but we know it cannot be at position 2, so we should try other positions.

In the feedback, for ""crane"", R was in position 2 and got (-), meaning R is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, if we put R in position 2 again, it would still be wrong, but we want to use one of the valid positions (1,3,4,5) to see if it's correct or misplaced.

But to save guesses, it's better to place R in a position where it might be correct. Since we don't know, we can try position 1.

Let me try to find words with R in position 1: e.g., ""ROBOT"", but B, O, T. And has O twice? But we don't mind repeating if necessary? But better unique letters.

""ROBOT"" has two O's, which is inefficient for information.

""ROOMY"" has two O's and Y? Not ideal.

""ROCKS"" - R, O, C? But C is eliminated. No good.

""ROUGH"" - R,O,U,G,H. All new letters? Yes: O,U,G,H. And avoids C,A,N,E.

Similarly, ""ROWDY"" - R,O,W,D,Y.

But letters O,U,G,H are good.

""ROUGH"" is a valid word? R-O-U-G-H, yes, meaning not smooth.

Similarly, we could do ""TRIED"" but E is eliminated.

Or ""PRISM"" - P,R,I,S,M. Also good: I,S,M are new.

But R is in position 1? In PRISM: P is first? No, PRISM: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:S, 5:M.

We guessed R in position 2? But first feedback told us R is not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2 again, it might still be wrong. So we should avoid position 2 for R? Yes.

For PRISM: we must put R in a different position. In PRISM, R is at position 2, which we know is incorrect for R? So it would be inefficient to put R at position 2 again because it will certainly be marked as in the word but wrong position (-), and we learn nothing new about its possible location.

Better to put R in position 1,3,4, or 5.

So, back to words with R in first position: R _ _ _ _

Examples: RUSTY, ROUTE (has E, bad), ROUND (has N, bad).

RUSTY: R,U,S,T,Y → no eliminated letters? U,S,T,Y all new? Yes.

Similarly, RISKY: R,I,S,K,Y → I,S,K,Y new? K is new.

Both valid.

Or ROAST, but has A, eliminated.

Another: ROILS? Meaning boils? Not common.

RIPEN? Has E and N, bad.

So RUSTY seems solid: letters R,U,S,T,Y. All except R are untested.

Similarly, RISKY: R,I,S,K,Y.

But R is already known to be present.

Which one is better? Both cover common letters.

S and T are more common than K and Y, so RUSTY might be better.

Another word: ROUSE? But has E, bad.

Since we also want to potentially find the position of R, putting R in position 1 might help if the secret word starts with R? Or not.

Alternatively, because R cannot be in position 2, we might put R in position 3 or 4. For example, words like _ _ R _ _

But if we put R in position 3, for example, we can test that position.

But we don't know where it is.

Generally, continuing with a word that has R in position 1 is fine.

But let me think about the remaining possibilities. Since A is out, the second vowel might be I,O,U.

Common consonants left: S, T, L, D, etc.

I think RUSTY is a reasonable guess.

After thinking, another classic second guess after ""CRANE"" with R present and others absent might be something like ""POLAR"", but A is out? Yes, A is eliminated, so it cannot be.

Or ""TRIAL"" - has A and E? No, but A is out.

So better stick with RUSTY.

But in RUSTY, we have R at position 1, which might be correct? Or not. We'll see.

If it's correct, we get green, otherwise, minus.

Similarly, we test U,S,T,Y.

If we get feedback, we can proceed.

But let's confirm: with R at 1st position, if it turns out green, that would be great. If not, we know R is not in position 1.

So, I'll go with RUSTY.

But we must avoid using the eliminated letters: C,A,N,E.

RUSTY: no C,A,N,E? R,U,S,T,Y: U not eliminated? A was eliminated but U is new.

So yes.

Similarly, any word without C,A,N,E is acceptable.

So I decide to guess ""RUSTY"".
</think>
<thoughts>
From the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (all marked 'x').
- R is in the word but not in the second position (marked '-').

Therefore, the secret word contains R in one of these positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5, but not 2.  
I need to choose a new guess that:
- Includes R (to help locate its position).
- Avoids C, A, N, E.
- Uses other common untested letters (like S, T, U, O, I) to gather more information.
- Prioritizes words with R in a new position (not position 2) and unique letters.

After considering words like ""POURS"", ""TOURS"", and ""ROUGH"", I selected ""RUSTY"" because:
- R is in position 1 (a new position to test).
- U, S, T, and Y are untested high-frequency letters.
- It avoids eliminated letters and has no duplicates.
- This choice maximizes information on R's position and tests new common consonants (S, T) and vowels (U).

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word because it has three common consonants and two vowels.<thoughts>
I need to make my first guess in the Wordle game. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically:
- Uses common letters (vowels and frequent consonants)
- Avoids repeating letters
- Covers multiple common positions

The word ""CRANE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N)
- All letters are unique
- It covers frequent letter positions (e.g., C often starts words, E often ends words)
- It's a valid English word

This choice will provide clear feedback on several high-frequency letters, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) - C is not in the secret word.
R(-) - R is in the secret word but not in the second position (since we guessed R in the second position and it was marked as in the word but wrong position).
A(x) - A is not in the secret word.
N(x) - N is not in the secret word.
E(x) - E is not in the secret word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, E are NOT in the secret word.

Since R is in the word but not in the second position, it must be in one of the other positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need to make a new 5-letter guess that:
- Includes R (because it's in the word), but not in the second position.
- Avoids using C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Should try to test other common letters to gather more information.

Common English letters: After vowels (A, E are out), other vowels: O, I, U. Also common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

Potential letters to use: Since we know R is present, let's consider words that have R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We also need to avoid positions that might conflict. But since R's position is unknown, we can try placing it in a different spot.

Moreover, we should aim for a word that uses other high-frequency letters that we haven't tested yet. We haven't tested: O, I, U, S, T, L, D, H, M, etc.

A good approach might be to pick a word with R in a new position and several new common letters.

Let me brainstorm some words:

- Since R cannot be in position 2, let's try putting R in position 1: words like ""RO..."". But R might be in 3,4, or 5 as well.

To maximize information, perhaps we can avoid putting R in position 2 and try it elsewhere.

Possible words: 
- Start with R?: ""ROTIS"", but isn't a word. 
- Valid words: ""ROAST"" - but has A (which is eliminated), and S and T are new.

But A is out, so we can't use ROAST.

Similarly, ""ROUTE"" has E which is out.

What about ""ROUND""? Has R in 1st, O, U, N, D. But N is eliminated? Wait, feedback said N(x) so N is not in the word. So ROUND has N? So we cannot use N? Yes, since N(x) from first guess.

Similarly, E is out, so we need a word without C,A,N,E.

Available letters: we can use consonants like B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But focus on high frequency.

Vowels: O, I, U (since A and E are out).

So, possible word with R: let me think of common words.

Option: ""POURS"" - P, O, U, R, S. But R is in the 4th position? Positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:U, 4:R, 5:S. So R is in position 4. And we avoid position 2 for R? Yes, because R was in position 2 in first guess and was wrong position.

But does ""POURS"" exist? Yes.

Other options: ""TOURS"" - T,O,U,R,S. Similarly R in position 4.

Or ""GROUP"" - G,R,O,U,P - R in position 2? But we cannot put R in position 2 because we already know it's not there. Feedback: R was in position 2 and was marked as present but wrong position, so we must avoid putting R in position 2 again? Actually, we can put it elsewhere, but we know it cannot be at position 2, so we should try other positions.

In the feedback, for ""crane"", R was in position 2 and got (-), meaning R is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, if we put R in position 2 again, it would still be wrong, but we want to use one of the valid positions (1,3,4,5) to see if it's correct or misplaced.

But to save guesses, it's better to place R in a position where it might be correct. Since we don't know, we can try position 1.

Let me try to find words with R in position 1: e.g., ""ROBOT"", but B, O, T. And has O twice? But we don't mind repeating if necessary? But better unique letters.

""ROBOT"" has two O's, which is inefficient for information.

""ROOMY"" has two O's and Y? Not ideal.

""ROCKS"" - R, O, C? But C is eliminated. No good.

""ROUGH"" - R,O,U,G,H. All new letters? Yes: O,U,G,H. And avoids C,A,N,E.

Similarly, ""ROWDY"" - R,O,W,D,Y.

But letters O,U,G,H are good.

""ROUGH"" is a valid word? R-O-U-G-H, yes, meaning not smooth.

Similarly, we could do ""TRIED"" but E is eliminated.

Or ""PRISM"" - P,R,I,S,M. Also good: I,S,M are new.

But R is in position 1? In PRISM: P is first? No, PRISM: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:S, 5:M.

We guessed R in position 2? But first feedback told us R is not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2 again, it might still be wrong. So we should avoid position 2 for R? Yes.

For PRISM: we must put R in a different position. In PRISM, R is at position 2, which we know is incorrect for R? So it would be inefficient to put R at position 2 again because it will certainly be marked as in the word but wrong position (-), and we learn nothing new about its possible location.

Better to put R in position 1,3,4, or 5.

So, back to words with R in first position: R _ _ _ _

Examples: RUSTY, ROUTE (has E, bad), ROUND (has N, bad).

RUSTY: R,U,S,T,Y → no eliminated letters? U,S,T,Y all new? Yes.

Similarly, RISKY: R,I,S,K,Y → I,S,K,Y new? K is new.

Both valid.

Or ROAST, but has A, eliminated.

Another: ROILS? Meaning boils? Not common.

RIPEN? Has E and N, bad.

So RUSTY seems solid: letters R,U,S,T,Y. All except R are untested.

Similarly, RISKY: R,I,S,K,Y.

But R is already known to be present.

Which one is better? Both cover common letters.

S and T are more common than K and Y, so RUSTY might be better.

Another word: ROUSE? But has E, bad.

Since we also want to potentially find the position of R, putting R in position 1 might help if the secret word starts with R? Or not.

Alternatively, because R cannot be in position 2, we might put R in position 3 or 4. For example, words like _ _ R _ _

But if we put R in position 3, for example, we can test that position.

But we don't know where it is.

Generally, continuing with a word that has R in position 1 is fine.

But let me think about the remaining possibilities. Since A is out, the second vowel might be I,O,U.

Common consonants left: S, T, L, D, etc.

I think RUSTY is a reasonable guess.

After thinking, another classic second guess after ""CRANE"" with R present and others absent might be something like ""POLAR"", but A is out? Yes, A is eliminated, so it cannot be.

Or ""TRIAL"" - has A and E? No, but A is out.

So better stick with RUSTY.

But in RUSTY, we have R at position 1, which might be correct? Or not. We'll see.

If it's correct, we get green, otherwise, minus.

Similarly, we test U,S,T,Y.

If we get feedback, we can proceed.

But let's confirm: with R at 1st position, if it turns out green, that would be great. If not, we know R is not in position 1.

So, I'll go with RUSTY.

But we must avoid using the eliminated letters: C,A,N,E.

RUSTY: no C,A,N,E? R,U,S,T,Y: U not eliminated? A was eliminated but U is new.

So yes.

Similarly, any word without C,A,N,E is acceptable.

So I decide to guess ""RUSTY"".<thoughts>
From the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word (all marked 'x').
- R is in the word but not in the second position (marked '-').

Therefore, the secret word contains R in one of these positions: 1, 3, 4, or 5, but not 2.  
I need to choose a new guess that:
- Includes R (to help locate its position).
- Avoids C, A, N, E.
- Uses other common untested letters (like S, T, U, O, I) to gather more information.
- Prioritizes words with R in a new position (not position 2) and unique letters.

After considering words like ""POURS"", ""TOURS"", and ""ROUGH"", I selected ""RUSTY"" because:
- R is in position 1 (a new position to test).
- U, S, T, and Y are untested high-frequency letters.
- It avoids eliminated letters and has no duplicates.
- This choice maximizes information on R's position and tests new common consonants (S, T) and vowels (U).

We have feedback from two guesses:
Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: rusty -> Feedback: R(-) U(x) S(-) T(x) Y(✓)

Analysis:
From ""crane"":
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.

From ""rusty"":
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5) because we got (✓) for Y at the end.
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and marked '-', so it's not there).
- U is not in the word (U(x)).
- S is in the word but not in position 3 (guessed in position 3, marked '-'), so S is present but elsewhere.
- T is not in the word (T(x)).
- Y is correct at position 5.

Combined knowledge:
- Secret word must have R and S (since they are in the word) and Y at the end (position 5).
- Letters not present: C, A, N, E, U, T.
- Also, R and S are in the word, but their positions are unknown except:
  - R is not in position 1 (from rust) or position 2 (from crane).
  - S is not in position 3 (from rusty).

The secret word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ Y (since Y is at position 5).

Recap positions:
- Position 1: R cannot be here (from rusty) nor could C,A,N,E,U,T which are out.
- Position 2: R cannot be here (from crane) and not C,A,N,E,U,T.
- Position 3: S cannot be here (from rusty), and not the other excluded letters.
- Position 4: We have no information; could be R or S or other.
- Position 5: Y (fixed).

Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, U, T.

Included letters: R, S, Y (and possibly others).

Now, we need to find a word that ends with Y and contains R and S, without C,A,N,E,U,T.

Possible letters: vowels: I, O; consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (but focus on common ones).

Common letters: O, I, L, H, D, M, P, etc.

We must include R and S because we know they are present.

Also, R and S must be placed in positions 1,3,4? But:
- R cannot be in 1 or 2 → so R must be in position 3 or 4? Because position 5 is Y.
- S cannot be in position 3 → so S must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Therefore, possible placements:
- R: must be in 3 or 4.
- S: must be in 1, 2, or 4.

But note: position 4 could be either R or S, but also could be another letter? If S is in 4 and R in 3, or R in 4 and S in 1 or 2, etc.

We need a word that fits: _ _ _ _ Y

We can try to construct possible words.

Since Y is last, common word endings: but not -TY because T is eliminated? Not -EY, not -AY, etc.

Common patterns: e.g., __ RSY? but R and S must be placed.

Because S could be in position 4: then we have _ _ _ S Y? Position 4: S and position 5: Y → so the word ends with SY? But SY is not a common ending; it's usually when S is before another consonant? But SY words exist? Like ""BUSY"", but U is eliminated? U is out.

Other words ending with SY: ""MESSY"" (M, E but E out), ""FUSSY"" (U out), ""GLASSY"" (6 letters), ""GASSY"" (has A and S repeated? but A out).

""GASSY"" has A? Not good.

""LOSSY""? Not common.

Or ""PASSY"" not a word.

Perhaps R and S in other positions.

Since R must be in 3 or 4:
- If R is in position 3: word pattern: _ _ R _ Y
- The fourth position cannot be S yet? But S must be elsewhere? For example, S in position 1 or 2? Also, we have an extra letter.

Similarly, if R is in position 4: pattern _ _ _ R Y → ends with RY. Common words: ""BERRY"" (E out), ""CARRY"" (A out), ""FERRY"" (E out), ""HARRY"" (A out), ""MARRY"" (A out), ""WORRY"" (O,W,R,R,Y? has two R's? but R is known once? We don't know if there are duplicate R? Feedback hasn't indicated duplicates? So possible.

In ""rusty"", R was guessed once and marked present. In ""crane"", R was guessed once? If there were two R, we might have seen multiple R in feedback? But in this case, since each guess has only one R, we only see that R is present.

So the secret word might have multiple R? It's possible.

Similarly for S? At least one each.

But we have no evidence of duplicates.

So back to patterns.

Possible words:
- If R in position 4: ends with RY?
  Examples: ""SORRY"" - S,O,R,R,Y? two R's? But S in position 1? Then pattern S _ _ R Y? For SORRY: positions 1:S, 2:O, 3:R, 4:R... wait not five letters? Sorry is 5: S,O,R,R,Y → so positions: S(1),O(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5) → two R's? But R is at position 3 and 4? We have R only once so far? But it could be.

But we need to see if valid. Also, O is a vowel available? Available? We haven't eliminated O.

Similarly, ""WORRY"": W,O,R,R,Y → R at 3 and 4? Again two R's.

Other words: ""CURRY"" has U? Out.

""LORRY"" L,O,R,R,Y → two R's.

It seems common to have two R's in RY ending words? Or single?

What about R in position 3: pattern _ _ R _ Y

For example, with S in position 1: S _ R _ Y → words like ""SHIRY""? Not word. ""SORRY"" we saw? But SORRY has R at 3 and 4? How about different? ""STRAY"" but has T and A? Both out? T eliminated, A eliminated.

No, T is out.

""SCRY"" is 4 letters.

Hard to find.

Perhaps S in position 2? Pattern: _ S R _ Y → like ""a s r x y"" → words: ""ISROY"" not word? Or without the R at 3? But we are trying R at 3.

Perhaps R in position 3 and S in position 4: then _ _ R S Y → ends with RSY? Which is rare? Example: ""FIRST"" doesn't end with Y.

""ARSY"" not word.

Alternatively, R in position 4: then S could be in position 1 or 2.

Pattern for R at 4: _ _ _ R Y → and S at position 1: S _ _ R Y → words like ""SPARY""? Not common. ""SHIRY"" no? ""SCARY"" has C and A? Out.

""SMIRY"" not word.

S at position 2: _ S _ R Y → like ""a s x r y"" → ""ISORY"" no? ""ASPERY"" too long? Five letters: ""DOSRY"" not word.

""POSRY"" not word.

Let's list all possible English words ending with Y that contain R and S, without C,A,N,E,U,T.

Common patterns: ending with -RY, -SY, etc.

Try to find words that have R and S.

- BRISY? Not word.
- PRISM ends with M not Y.

Perhaps I missed: ""BUSKY"" not and U out.

""FRISK"" ends with K? Doesn't end with Y.

Another idea: perhaps there is S and R separately? Or one of them is not single.

Since Y is at end, and must include R and S, probably the word has other consonants.

List of possible words ending with Y that contain R and S and the required letters.

Examples:
- ""RASPY"": has A? Eliminated.
- ""RISKY"": contains S? Positions: R,I,S,K,Y → but we eliminated U,T but not I,K? Also, if word is RISKY, positions:1:R,2:I,3:S,4:K,5:Y.

For R: guessed at pos1 in rusty, it was marked minus → so R not at position 1? But RISKY has R at 1? Contradicts.

In our earlier guess, R at position 1 was marked minus, meaning R is in the word but not position 1, so RISKY has R at 1 → invalid.

Similarly, ""MUSKY"" has U → out.

""DISKY"" not word.

""WISPY"" has I and S? But ends with Y? W,I,S,P,Y → if it is a word? Wis meaning? Wispy is not standard? Must be valid English word.

"" FUSTY"" has U → out.

Another word: ""PALSY"" - P,A,L,S,Y → has A? Out.

""GAWSY"" not word.

Perhaps ""DROSSY"" too long? 6 letters.

""GROSSY"" not word.

Another: ""BOSSY"" not? B,O,S,S,Y → contains S at pos 3 and 4? But includes only one S? But doubled? And has O? Available? Pattern: B,O,S,S,Y → ends with SY? But SS.

Feedback doesn't show duplicates explicitly? In rusty, we guessed S once and it was marked minus? But bossy has two S.

But we know S is present, could be multiple.

But ""bossy"" has O,B? We don't know.

But let's think: secret word ends with Y? Position 5 Y.

And S is not at position 3? So in bossy: positions: 1:B,2:O,3:S,4:S,5:Y → but S at position 3? We have feedback from rusty that S is not at position 3? Because in rusty, S was at position 3 and marked with ( - ) meaning S is in the word but not at position 3? So for bossy, if S at position 3, it would also be wrong? But it might be correct if the secret word has S at position 3? But no, the feedback says S is misplaced at pos 3, but it might be elsewhere? However, for bossy, the S at position 3 might be correct or not? But according to previous, S cannot be at position 3?

From rusty feedback: S(-) in position 3 → secret word has S but not at position 3? Therefore, any word with S at position 3 would show similar feedback? So we should avoid position 3 for S.

Therefore, for bossy, putting S at position 3 would be incorrect because we know S is not at position 3.

Similarly, for our new guess, we should not put S at position 3.

Back to possible words.

I think we need to look for a word that is _ _ _ _ Y with R and S in it, R not in 1 or 2, S not in 3.

Also, letters not in: C,A,N,E,U,T.

Possible positions for R: 3 or 4.
For S: 1, 2, or 4.

Now, if S is in position 4, then R must be in position 3? Because position 4 is S? Or R could be in 3 when S in 4? Let me not overlap.

Case: S in position 1 and R in position 4: pattern s _ _ r y
Words: ""SORRY""? But S at 1, O at 2, R at 3 and 4? But position 4 is R? SORRY: 1:S,2:O,3:R,4:R,5:Y → so position 4 is R? And position 3 is also R. So for position 4, R is at 4? And position 3 R is also there.

But we need R to be in 3 or 4? If we have R at both, it's okay? But in this case, it fits the pattern? But  the word must have only one R? No, it can have two? We don't know.

But SORRY has two R's? In feedback, if there is one R, it will show as present regardless of position? So it's possible.

But for SORRY: check if letters are okay? O available, and S and R and Y.

No excluded letters? C,A,N,E,U,T None in SORRY.

Is ""sorry"" valid? Yes, means feeling sorrow.

Similarly, pattern _ S _ R Y: for R in 4 and S in 2? Word like "" w s x r y"" _ S _ R Y? ""ISERY"" not word? ""POSRY"" not.

I think SORRY might be a candidate.

But in SORRY, R is in position 3 and 4? But position 3 is R? But we guessed R at position 3? No, we guessed R at position 3 only in the sense that we haven't guessed it at position 3 yet?  In ""crane"" we had R at position 2? And ""rusty"" at 1? Not at 3.

For position 3: in SORRY, R at position 3 should be correct only if the secret word has R at position 3? But it might be part of the otherR? Not necessarily.

Think about the feedback: the secret word has S at position 1? In SORRY, S at 1, if correct, we get green.

Similarly, R at position 4? But in SORRY, position 3 is also R? So it has R at both 3 and 4? But we don't know if the word has multiple R's.

Other possibility: R in position 3 and S in position 2: pattern _ S R _ Y? Like "" O S R K Y"" ?

For example, ""OSPREY"" too long? 6 letters.

Five words: ""ESPRY"" not.

Hard.

R in position 3 and S in position 1: pattern S _ R _ Y → ""SIRKY"" not word? ""SHIREY"" not.

""SPRAY"" has P and R? But has A? Eliminated.

""STRY"" not.

""WISRY"" not.

So it's difficult. Maybe SORRY is the only common word.

Other words: ""MURKY"" has U? Out.

""PERKY"" has E? Out.

""JERKY"" has E? Out.

""ORKY"" not.

So SORRY seems a good guess to test.

In SORRY, the letters are S, O, R, R, Y — but R is duplicated? But it's allowed.

For the feedback purpose:
- Position 1: S — we know S is in the word? From rusty, S is in the word. But is it at position 1? We don't know. If it is, we get green. If not, it might show minus or if not present but it is present, it will be minus? Since S is in the word, and if not at position 1, it will be minus.
- Position 2: O — unknown? O could be in the word or not.
- Position 3: R — we know R is in word? Could be at position 3? We don't know.
- Position 4: R — same R? But if there is only one R, then only one position might be correct? But since it has two, it might help.
- Position 5: Y — we know it is correct? So must be green.

But by guessing SORRY, we test S at 1, O at 2, R at 3 and 4.

Even if not the exact word, it might provide information.

Another good guess: ""BORED"" but has E? Out.

""GODLY"" no R or S.

We need to include both R and S.

Since Y is fixed at position 5, and S is in the word, and R is in the word, and we need to place them.

What about ""DRYSY"" not a word.

"" CRYPT"" no Y at end? And has C.

I think ""SORRY"" is reasonable.

Perhaps ""HOR SY"" no.

""ORASY"" has A? Out.

So I'll go with ""SORRY"".

But let's confirm: by guessing SORRY, possible outcomes:
- If S is at position 1: green
- O at position 2: could be anything? If present or not.
- R at position 3: if R is here, green? If not, and R is at another position, it might show minus? etc.

We get detailed feedback per letter.

Alternative: ""WORDY"" has W,O,R,D,Y → includes R? Yes, but not S? But S must be in the word! Important: S is in the word, from rusty feedback.

So we must include S in the guess? Yes, to get additional feedback? Or at least to solve? But if we don't include S, it might not be helpful? For example, if we guess a word without S, but S is in the secret word, for letters that are not S, we may get feedback, but we haven't tested S's position? It's inefficient.

Better to include S to locate it.

Therefore, SORRY includes S and R.

Similarly, another word: ""ROSES"" but ends with S? We need Y at end.

""ROSIN"" ends with N? Out.

So SORRY is best.

In SORRY, we have O, which is new? Common vowel.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, guess ""SORRY"".
</think>
<thoughts>
We have the following information from previous feedback:
1. **crane**: 
   - C (position 1) → not in word (x)
   - R (position 2) → in word, wrong position (-)
   - A (position 3) → not in word (x)
   - N (position 4) → not in word (x)
   - E (position 5) → not in word (x)
   - Thus, R is in the word, but not in position 2. Letters C, A, N, E are absent.

2. **rusty**:
   - R (position 1) → in word, wrong position (-) → confirms R is not in position 1.
   - U (position 2) → not in word (x)
   - S (position 3) → in word, wrong position (-) → confirms S is not in position 3.
   - T (position 4) → not in word (x)
   - Y (position 5) → in word, correct position (✓) → confirms Y is in the word and fixed at position 5.

**Key deductions:**
- Secret word ends with Y: pattern _ _ _ _ Y.
- Confirmed letters in the word: R, S, Y (since both R and S received '-' feedback, indicating presence).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, T (from both feedbacks).
- Position constraints:
  - R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from guesses), so must be in position 3 or 4.
  - S cannot be in position 3 (from rusty), so must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- Possible positions for R and S:
  - Position 4: Could be R or S, but not both unless duplicated (duplicates are possible).
  - If R is in position 3, S could be in 1, 2, or 4.
  - If R is in position 4, S could be in 1 or 2.
- Remaining vowels: O, I (since A, E, U are out).
- Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, etc.

Given this, I need a word that:
- Ends with Y (position 5).
- Includes R and S.
- Avoids C, A, N, E, U, T.
- Tests new common letters (like O, I, H, M) while respecting position constraints.
- Ideal candidate: ""SORRY"" because:
  - Positions: 
    - S at 1 (tests if S is position 1)
    - O at 2 (new vowel)
    - R at 3 (tests position constraint for R, which can't be 1 or 2)
    - R at 4 (tests position constraint; possible duplicate R)
    - Y at 5 (already known ✓).
  - Letters used: S, O, R, R, Y → avoids eliminated letters and tests new vowel O.
  - Word validity: ""SORRY"" is a valid English word.
  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal positions for S, O, and R (clarifying if R/S are duplicated or positions).

Other considered words like ""WORDY"" lack S, ""RISKY"" violates R position 1, and ""ROSES"" doesn't end with Y. SORRY maximizes information on R/S placement and new letter testing.
</thoughts>

<guess>sorry</guess>",sorry,"We have feedback from two guesses:
Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: rusty -> Feedback: R(-) U(x) S(-) T(x) Y(✓)

Analysis:
From ""crane"":
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, E are not in the word.

From ""rusty"":
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5) because we got (✓) for Y at the end.
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and marked '-', so it's not there).
- U is not in the word (U(x)).
- S is in the word but not in position 3 (guessed in position 3, marked '-'), so S is present but elsewhere.
- T is not in the word (T(x)).
- Y is correct at position 5.

Combined knowledge:
- Secret word must have R and S (since they are in the word) and Y at the end (position 5).
- Letters not present: C, A, N, E, U, T.
- Also, R and S are in the word, but their positions are unknown except:
  - R is not in position 1 (from rust) or position 2 (from crane).
  - S is not in position 3 (from rusty).

The secret word has 5 letters: _ _ _ _ Y (since Y is at position 5).

Recap positions:
- Position 1: R cannot be here (from rusty) nor could C,A,N,E,U,T which are out.
- Position 2: R cannot be here (from crane) and not C,A,N,E,U,T.
- Position 3: S cannot be here (from rusty), and not the other excluded letters.
- Position 4: We have no information; could be R or S or other.
- Position 5: Y (fixed).

Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, U, T.

Included letters: R, S, Y (and possibly others).

Now, we need to find a word that ends with Y and contains R and S, without C,A,N,E,U,T.

Possible letters: vowels: I, O; consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (but focus on common ones).

Common letters: O, I, L, H, D, M, P, etc.

We must include R and S because we know they are present.

Also, R and S must be placed in positions 1,3,4? But:
- R cannot be in 1 or 2 → so R must be in position 3 or 4? Because position 5 is Y.
- S cannot be in position 3 → so S must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Therefore, possible placements:
- R: must be in 3 or 4.
- S: must be in 1, 2, or 4.

But note: position 4 could be either R or S, but also could be another letter? If S is in 4 and R in 3, or R in 4 and S in 1 or 2, etc.

We need a word that fits: _ _ _ _ Y

We can try to construct possible words.

Since Y is last, common word endings: but not -TY because T is eliminated? Not -EY, not -AY, etc.

Common patterns: e.g., __ RSY? but R and S must be placed.

Because S could be in position 4: then we have _ _ _ S Y? Position 4: S and position 5: Y → so the word ends with SY? But SY is not a common ending; it's usually when S is before another consonant? But SY words exist? Like ""BUSY"", but U is eliminated? U is out.

Other words ending with SY: ""MESSY"" (M, E but E out), ""FUSSY"" (U out), ""GLASSY"" (6 letters), ""GASSY"" (has A and S repeated? but A out).

""GASSY"" has A? Not good.

""LOSSY""? Not common.

Or ""PASSY"" not a word.

Perhaps R and S in other positions.

Since R must be in 3 or 4:
- If R is in position 3: word pattern: _ _ R _ Y
- The fourth position cannot be S yet? But S must be elsewhere? For example, S in position 1 or 2? Also, we have an extra letter.

Similarly, if R is in position 4: pattern _ _ _ R Y → ends with RY. Common words: ""BERRY"" (E out), ""CARRY"" (A out), ""FERRY"" (E out), ""HARRY"" (A out), ""MARRY"" (A out), ""WORRY"" (O,W,R,R,Y? has two R's? but R is known once? We don't know if there are duplicate R? Feedback hasn't indicated duplicates? So possible.

In ""rusty"", R was guessed once and marked present. In ""crane"", R was guessed once? If there were two R, we might have seen multiple R in feedback? But in this case, since each guess has only one R, we only see that R is present.

So the secret word might have multiple R? It's possible.

Similarly for S? At least one each.

But we have no evidence of duplicates.

So back to patterns.

Possible words:
- If R in position 4: ends with RY?
  Examples: ""SORRY"" - S,O,R,R,Y? two R's? But S in position 1? Then pattern S _ _ R Y? For SORRY: positions 1:S, 2:O, 3:R, 4:R... wait not five letters? Sorry is 5: S,O,R,R,Y → so positions: S(1),O(2),R(3),R(4),Y(5) → two R's? But R is at position 3 and 4? We have R only once so far? But it could be.

But we need to see if valid. Also, O is a vowel available? Available? We haven't eliminated O.

Similarly, ""WORRY"": W,O,R,R,Y → R at 3 and 4? Again two R's.

Other words: ""CURRY"" has U? Out.

""LORRY"" L,O,R,R,Y → two R's.

It seems common to have two R's in RY ending words? Or single?

What about R in position 3: pattern _ _ R _ Y

For example, with S in position 1: S _ R _ Y → words like ""SHIRY""? Not word. ""SORRY"" we saw? But SORRY has R at 3 and 4? How about different? ""STRAY"" but has T and A? Both out? T eliminated, A eliminated.

No, T is out.

""SCRY"" is 4 letters.

Hard to find.

Perhaps S in position 2? Pattern: _ S R _ Y → like ""a s r x y"" → words: ""ISROY"" not word? Or without the R at 3? But we are trying R at 3.

Perhaps R in position 3 and S in position 4: then _ _ R S Y → ends with RSY? Which is rare? Example: ""FIRST"" doesn't end with Y.

""ARSY"" not word.

Alternatively, R in position 4: then S could be in position 1 or 2.

Pattern for R at 4: _ _ _ R Y → and S at position 1: S _ _ R Y → words like ""SPARY""? Not common. ""SHIRY"" no? ""SCARY"" has C and A? Out.

""SMIRY"" not word.

S at position 2: _ S _ R Y → like ""a s x r y"" → ""ISORY"" no? ""ASPERY"" too long? Five letters: ""DOSRY"" not word.

""POSRY"" not word.

Let's list all possible English words ending with Y that contain R and S, without C,A,N,E,U,T.

Common patterns: ending with -RY, -SY, etc.

Try to find words that have R and S.

- BRISY? Not word.
- PRISM ends with M not Y.

Perhaps I missed: ""BUSKY"" not and U out.

""FRISK"" ends with K? Doesn't end with Y.

Another idea: perhaps there is S and R separately? Or one of them is not single.

Since Y is at end, and must include R and S, probably the word has other consonants.

List of possible words ending with Y that contain R and S and the required letters.

Examples:
- ""RASPY"": has A? Eliminated.
- ""RISKY"": contains S? Positions: R,I,S,K,Y → but we eliminated U,T but not I,K? Also, if word is RISKY, positions:1:R,2:I,3:S,4:K,5:Y.

For R: guessed at pos1 in rusty, it was marked minus → so R not at position 1? But RISKY has R at 1? Contradicts.

In our earlier guess, R at position 1 was marked minus, meaning R is in the word but not position 1, so RISKY has R at 1 → invalid.

Similarly, ""MUSKY"" has U → out.

""DISKY"" not word.

""WISPY"" has I and S? But ends with Y? W,I,S,P,Y → if it is a word? Wis meaning? Wispy is not standard? Must be valid English word.

"" FUSTY"" has U → out.

Another word: ""PALSY"" - P,A,L,S,Y → has A? Out.

""GAWSY"" not word.

Perhaps ""DROSSY"" too long? 6 letters.

""GROSSY"" not word.

Another: ""BOSSY"" not? B,O,S,S,Y → contains S at pos 3 and 4? But includes only one S? But doubled? And has O? Available? Pattern: B,O,S,S,Y → ends with SY? But SS.

Feedback doesn't show duplicates explicitly? In rusty, we guessed S once and it was marked minus? But bossy has two S.

But we know S is present, could be multiple.

But ""bossy"" has O,B? We don't know.

But let's think: secret word ends with Y? Position 5 Y.

And S is not at position 3? So in bossy: positions: 1:B,2:O,3:S,4:S,5:Y → but S at position 3? We have feedback from rusty that S is not at position 3? Because in rusty, S was at position 3 and marked with ( - ) meaning S is in the word but not at position 3? So for bossy, if S at position 3, it would also be wrong? But it might be correct if the secret word has S at position 3? But no, the feedback says S is misplaced at pos 3, but it might be elsewhere? However, for bossy, the S at position 3 might be correct or not? But according to previous, S cannot be at position 3?

From rusty feedback: S(-) in position 3 → secret word has S but not at position 3? Therefore, any word with S at position 3 would show similar feedback? So we should avoid position 3 for S.

Therefore, for bossy, putting S at position 3 would be incorrect because we know S is not at position 3.

Similarly, for our new guess, we should not put S at position 3.

Back to possible words.

I think we need to look for a word that is _ _ _ _ Y with R and S in it, R not in 1 or 2, S not in 3.

Also, letters not in: C,A,N,E,U,T.

Possible positions for R: 3 or 4.
For S: 1, 2, or 4.

Now, if S is in position 4, then R must be in position 3? Because position 4 is S? Or R could be in 3 when S in 4? Let me not overlap.

Case: S in position 1 and R in position 4: pattern s _ _ r y
Words: ""SORRY""? But S at 1, O at 2, R at 3 and 4? But position 4 is R? SORRY: 1:S,2:O,3:R,4:R,5:Y → so position 4 is R? And position 3 is also R. So for position 4, R is at 4? And position 3 R is also there.

But we need R to be in 3 or 4? If we have R at both, it's okay? But in this case, it fits the pattern? But  the word must have only one R? No, it can have two? We don't know.

But SORRY has two R's? In feedback, if there is one R, it will show as present regardless of position? So it's possible.

But for SORRY: check if letters are okay? O available, and S and R and Y.

No excluded letters? C,A,N,E,U,T None in SORRY.

Is ""sorry"" valid? Yes, means feeling sorrow.

Similarly, pattern _ S _ R Y: for R in 4 and S in 2? Word like "" w s x r y"" _ S _ R Y? ""ISERY"" not word? ""POSRY"" not.

I think SORRY might be a candidate.

But in SORRY, R is in position 3 and 4? But position 3 is R? But we guessed R at position 3? No, we guessed R at position 3 only in the sense that we haven't guessed it at position 3 yet?  In ""crane"" we had R at position 2? And ""rusty"" at 1? Not at 3.

For position 3: in SORRY, R at position 3 should be correct only if the secret word has R at position 3? But it might be part of the otherR? Not necessarily.

Think about the feedback: the secret word has S at position 1? In SORRY, S at 1, if correct, we get green.

Similarly, R at position 4? But in SORRY, position 3 is also R? So it has R at both 3 and 4? But we don't know if the word has multiple R's.

Other possibility: R in position 3 and S in position 2: pattern _ S R _ Y? Like "" O S R K Y"" ?

For example, ""OSPREY"" too long? 6 letters.

Five words: ""ESPRY"" not.

Hard.

R in position 3 and S in position 1: pattern S _ R _ Y → ""SIRKY"" not word? ""SHIREY"" not.

""SPRAY"" has P and R? But has A? Eliminated.

""STRY"" not.

""WISRY"" not.

So it's difficult. Maybe SORRY is the only common word.

But by guessing SORRY, we test S at 1, O at 2, R at 3 and 4.

""GODLY"" no R or S.

In SORRY, we have O, which is new? Common vowel.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, guess ""SORRY"".<thoughts>
We have the following information from previous feedback:
1. **crane**: 
   - C (position 1) → not in word (x)
   - R (position 2) → in word, wrong position (-)
   - A (position 3) → not in word (x)
   - N (position 4) → not in word (x)
   - E (position 5) → not in word (x)
   - Thus, R is in the word, but not in position 2. Letters C, A, N, E are absent.

2. **rusty**:
   - R (position 1) → in word, wrong position (-) → confirms R is not in position 1.
   - U (position 2) → not in word (x)
   - S (position 3) → in word, wrong position (-) → confirms S is not in position 3.
   - T (position 4) → not in word (x)
   - Y (position 5) → in word, correct position (✓) → confirms Y is in the word and fixed at position 5.

**Key deductions:**
- Secret word ends with Y: pattern _ _ _ _ Y.
- Confirmed letters in the word: R, S, Y (since both R and S received '-' feedback, indicating presence).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, T (from both feedbacks).
- Position constraints:
  - R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from guesses), so must be in position 3 or 4.
  - S cannot be in position 3 (from rusty), so must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- Possible positions for R and S:
  - Position 4: Could be R or S, but not both unless duplicated (duplicates are possible).
  - If R is in position 3, S could be in 1, 2, or 4.
  - If R is in position 4, S could be in 1 or 2.
- Remaining vowels: O, I (since A, E, U are out).
- Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, etc.

Given this, I need a word that:
- Ends with Y (position 5).
- Includes R and S.
- Avoids C, A, N, E, U, T.
- Tests new common letters (like O, I, H, M) while respecting position constraints.
- Ideal candidate: ""SORRY"" because:
  - Positions: 
    - S at 1 (tests if S is position 1)
    - O at 2 (new vowel)
    - R at 3 (tests position constraint for R, which can't be 1 or 2)
    - R at 4 (tests position constraint; possible duplicate R)
    - Y at 5 (already known ✓).
  - Letters used: S, O, R, R, Y → avoids eliminated letters and tests new vowel O.
  - Word validity: ""SORRY"" is a valid English word.
  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal positions for S, O, and R (clarifying if R/S are duplicated or positions).

Other considered words like ""WORDY"" lack S, ""RISKY"" violates R position 1, and ""ROSES"" doesn't end with Y. SORRY maximizes information on R/S placement and new letter testing.
