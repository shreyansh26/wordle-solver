We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the secret word
- R: ✓ -> in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2)
- A: x -> not in the secret word
- N: - -> in the word but wrong position
- E: x -> not in the secret word

So, from this:
- The letter R is correct and at position 2 (so the secret word has R as the second letter).
- The letter N is in the secret word but not at position 4 (since in ""crane"" it was at position 4, but it must be in a different position).
- Letters C, A, E are excluded (since they are marked 'x'). So the secret word does not contain C, A, or E.

We need to make a second guess. We must pick a 5-letter word that:
- Has R at position 2 (since it's confirmed).
- Must include the letter N (since N is present) and put it in a position that is not 4. Also, we know N is not in position 4, but it could be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- Must not include C, A, E.

We can also consider other common letters to test.

The word must have the form: _ R _ _ _

We know the secret word has N, but not at position 4. Possible positions for N: 1, 3, or 5.

We should also try to cover other common consonants and vowels (but note that A and E are out, so vowels are limited: O, I, U are possible).

Let me think of words that fit:
- Start with: ? R ? ? ?
- Must contain N (somewhere except position 4) and not contain C, A, E.

Possibilities:
- Try to put N in position 1: ""N R ? ? ?""
- Or position 3: _ R N ? ?
- Or position 5: _ R ? ? N

But note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong position. So now, we need to avoid position 4 for N.

Also, we can test other common letters to get more information.

A good second guess might be ""ROBIN"", but wait: R is at position 2 (good) and O at 1? Let's check:

ROBIN: 
- Position 1: R? No, R must be at position 2. So ROBIN has R at position 1? Actually, R is at position 1 in ""ROBIN"", but we need R at position 2. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, let's write the positions: 
We need a word with structure: [first] R [third] [fourth] [fifth]

So for ROBIN: 
- R is at position 1 -> not at 2? So ROBIN would be: R at 1, O at 2? Then O is at position 2? But we need R at position 2. So ROBIN doesn't have R at position 2.

We must have the second letter as R.

Another idea: ""TRUNK""?
- T at 1, R at 2 (good), U at 3, N at 4, K at 5.
But in the feedback we know that N is NOT at position 4 (because in first guess it was at position 4 and marked '-', meaning it is in the word but not at that position). So we must not put N at position 4. Therefore, ""TRUNK"" would put N at position 4 again? That's the same position.

So we should avoid putting N at position 4.

What about ""DRINK""?
- D at 1, R at 2 (good), I at 3, N at 4? (but we cannot put N at position 4). So same problem.

We need to put N in a different position: either 1, 3, or 5.

Option 1: N at position 1 -> ""N R ...""
Example: ""NR..."" ... words like ""NRO"" are not words. How about ""NERVY""? But E is excluded, so cannot use E.

Option: N at position 3 -> _ R N _ _
Example words: BURNT? But U and R? Positions: B (1), R (2), N (3) ... then ??. But note: we cannot use A or E. Also, ""burnt"" has U? We can use U.

""Burnt"": B,U,R,N,T -> letters: B, U, R, N, T. R is at 2? Actually: B (1), U (2)? No, ""burnt"" has U at position 2? We need R at position 2. So structure: [1] R [3] [4] [5].

In ""burnt"": 
- B (1), U (2) -> but we need R at (2). So that doesn't work.

What about words with R at 2 and N at 3? For example: ""HORNS""? 
H (1), O (2) -> wait, no: H O R N S? Then R at 3? We need R at 2.

Must have R exactly at position 2.

Another: ""PRINT"": 
P (1), R (2) (good), I (3), N (4)? But we cannot place N at 4? Because it was wrong at 4 previously. So we need to put N at a different position.

But in the feedback of first guess, N was at position 4 and marked '-', meaning N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, for our second guess, putting N at position 4 again would be unwise because we know it's not there. So we must put N at one of the other positions: 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try to find words that have R at 2, N in the word but at position 1, 3, or 5, and without C, A, E.

Possible words:
- N at 1: ""N R ..."", e.g., ""NRO.."" not common. Maybe ""NURSE""? But has E? Excluded. ""NURSY"" is not a word. ""NARKS"" has A -> excluded. So difficult.

- N at 3: _ R N _ _
Examples: ""IRONY"" -> I (1), R (2), O (3)? Wait, no: I R O N Y? Then letters: I (1), R (2), O (3), N (4), Y (5). But again, N is at position 4? We don't want that.

Let me write positions clearly: 
Word: [1] R [3] [4] [5]
We want N at position 3: [1] R N [4] [5]

What words have this pattern? Without A, C, E.

Examples: 
- ""HORNS"": H (1), O (2) -> wait, O at 2? No: H O R N S -> R is at 3? Not 2.

We need R at position 2, so the word must be: 
Position 1: any letter
Position 2: R
Position 3: N (if we choose N at 3)
Position 4 and 5: two other letters

So pattern: letter1 + R + N + letter4 + letter5

Example words: 
- ""CRONY"": C at 1? But C is excluded. 
- ""TRONK"": not a word? 
- ""DRONE"": but D (1), R(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> N is at 4? Not 3. And E is excluded.
- ""GRIND"": G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4)? Again position 4 for N -> not allowed.

Position 3: so we need N at 3? Then: [1] R N [4] [5]

What about ""WORN""? Too short. We need 5 letters.

Let me think: is there a word ""BORNS""? Not common. ""BORNS"" not a word. 
""BORNE""? But has E -> excluded.

""STERN"": S(1), T(2)? But R must be at 2? So S T E R N? Then R at 4? Not 2.

Wait, we have to put R at position 2.

Another word: ""PORNS"" -> P(1), O(2)? Then R at 3? Not 2.

What about ""GIRNS""? Not common.

Maybe shift to putting N at position 5? So pattern: [1] R [3] [4] N

Example: ""XXXRN"", e.g., ""HORNS"" again: H(1), O(2) -> R at 3? Not 2. 

To have R at 2: must be letter1 R [3] [4] N (so N at 5)

Words: ""CRWTH""? Not standard. ""GIRTH"": G(1), I(2)? Then R at 3? No.

Example: ""CURNS"" not word. ""TURNS"": T(1), U(2)? Then R at 3? No.

Maybe: ""BYRN"": too short. 

How about ""WORN""? Not 5 letters.

Perhaps we should not force N at a particular position? The feedback doesn't require that we put N in the word again? Actually, we must include N in the word? No, but the feedback says that N is in the secret word, so we need to account for that. But for the second guess, we are not forced to include N? Actually, no rule says we must include known letters? However, it's beneficial to try to locate the position.

But we know N is in the word (somewhere) so we can try a word that has N at a different position to test.

However, we also want as much new information as possible: testing other consonants and vowels.

We can try a word that has R at position 2 (because it's confirmed) and without C,A,E, and containing N at position other than 4? And we can try other common letters.

A better approach: let's list available letters.

Excluded: C, A, E -> so vowels available: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.
Consonants: avoid those.

Now, consider common letters: R is fixed at 2.

Try a word that has R at 2, and includes N at a new position (say position 1 or 3 or 5) and other letters.

Let me try words with N at position 1: 
""nR___""
Examples: ""NURDS"", but has U and D? Also has S? But E not present? But we don't know if S is in. Alternatively, ""NODUS"" -> but O at 2? Then R? No.

Not many words start with ""NR"". 

Try N at position 5: 
""____N"", with R at position 2.

Words ending with N: 
Pattern: [1] R [3] [4] N

Examples: 
- ""GR_ _ N"": GROAN -> has O and A? A excluded. 
- ""BRAWN"" -> has A? Excluded. 
- ""DRAWN"" -> has A? Excluded. 
- ""FRONT"": F(1), R(2), O(3), N(4)? Then T(5) -> but N is at position 4? Again, same position.

Avoid N at 4.

What about ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> A excluded? And A we know is excluded.

Another: ""CROWN"": C(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> pattern: C (excluded? Yes, C is excluded). So invalid.

But excluding C: we cannot use C.

Another: ""PROWN"" not a word. 

""GROWN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> N at 5. Perfect.

And G, O, W are new letters. And they are allowed? G, O, W: none of them are excluded (we excluded C,A,E).

So ""GROWN"": 
- Letters: G, R, O, W, N. 
- Positions: G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). 
- R at 2 (good), N at 5 (which is new position to test, since it wasn't at 4).

Also, we get to test G, O, W.

Therefore, a good candidate? But wait: the secret word might have duplicate letters? Unlikely? And we don't know.

So let me choose ""GROWN"" as the second guess.

Wait another possibility: ""DROWN"" -> D(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). Also all new letters D, O, W, N.

But D is a common consonant? G and D are both fine.

I think either is acceptable.

But note: in the first guess, we had N at 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting N at 5? So it's a new position.

We also test O, W, and either G or D.

Perhaps ""DROWN"" is slightly more common? But both okay.

Or ""BROWN"": B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). Also possible.

But B is also a common letter.

I think ""BROWN"", ""GROWN"", or ""DROWN"" are all reasonable.

Let me choose ""GROWN"" to have G.

So second guess: GROWN

But note: the secret word might have O or W? We don't know.

But we are testing them.

Therefore, I will guess ""grown"".

But wait, what about words with N at position 3? We skipped that. 
Pattern: [1] R N [4] [5]
Example: ""URNED"" -> has E? Excluded. ""TRND_"" ... not really. Hard to find.

Another word: ""TORNS"": T(1), O(2)? Then R at 3? No.

If we put R at 2 and N at 3: [1] R N [4] [5]
""IRNOP"" not real. So ""GROWN"" seems better.

So I go with ""grown"".

<guess>grown</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", which showed:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: correct letter and position (✓ at position 2)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: present but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

Key insights:
- The secret word has R at position 2.
- The secret word includes N but not at position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""crane"" and marked wrong position).
- The letters C, A, and E are excluded.
- Available vowels: O, I, U (and possibly Y).

For the second guess, I chose ""grown"" because:
- It keeps R in position 2 (required).
- It places N at position 5 to test a new position (since position 4 is invalid for N).
- It introduces new common letters (G, O, W) to gather more information.
- It avoids excluded letters (no C, A, E).

<guess>grown</guess>",grown,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the secret word
- R: ✓ -> in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2)
- A: x -> not in the secret word
- N: - -> in the word but wrong position
- E: x -> not in the secret word

So, from this:
- The letter R is correct and at position 2 (so the secret word has R as the second letter).
- The letter N is in the secret word but not at position 4 (since in ""crane"" it was at position 4, but it must be in a different position).
- Letters C, A, E are excluded (since they are marked 'x'). So the secret word does not contain C, A, or E.

We need to make a second guess. We must pick a 5-letter word that:
- Has R at position 2 (since it's confirmed).
- Must include the letter N (since N is present) and put it in a position that is not 4. Also, we know N is not in position 4, but it could be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- Must not include C, A, E.

We can also consider other common letters to test.

The word must have the form: _ R _ _ _

We know the secret word has N, but not at position 4. Possible positions for N: 1, 3, or 5.

We should also try to cover other common consonants and vowels (but note that A and E are out, so vowels are limited: O, I, U are possible).

Let me think of words that fit:
- Start with: ? R ? ? ?
- Must contain N (somewhere except position 4) and not contain C, A, E.

Possibilities:
- Try to put N in position 1: ""N R ? ? ?""
- Or position 3: _ R N ? ?
- Or position 5: _ R ? ? N

But note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong position. So now, we need to avoid position 4 for N.

Also, we can test other common letters to get more information.

A good second guess might be ""ROBIN"", but wait: R is at position 2 (good) and O at 1? Let's check:

ROBIN: 
- Position 1: R? No, R must be at position 2. So ROBIN has R at position 1? Actually, R is at position 1 in ""ROBIN"", but we need R at position 2. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, let's write the positions: 
We need a word with structure: [first] R [third] [fourth] [fifth]

So for ROBIN: 
- R is at position 1 -> not at 2? So ROBIN would be: R at 1, O at 2? Then O is at position 2? But we need R at position 2. So ROBIN doesn't have R at position 2.

We must have the second letter as R.

Another idea: ""TRUNK""?
- T at 1, R at 2 (good), U at 3, N at 4, K at 5.
But in the feedback we know that N is NOT at position 4 (because in first guess it was at position 4 and marked '-', meaning it is in the word but not at that position). So we must not put N at position 4. Therefore, ""TRUNK"" would put N at position 4 again? That's the same position.

So we should avoid putting N at position 4.

What about ""DRINK""?
- D at 1, R at 2 (good), I at 3, N at 4? (but we cannot put N at position 4). So same problem.

We need to put N in a different position: either 1, 3, or 5.

Option 1: N at position 1 -> ""N R ...""
Example: ""NR..."" ... words like ""NRO"" are not words. How about ""NERVY""? But E is excluded, so cannot use E.

Option: N at position 3 -> _ R N _ _
Example words: BURNT? But U and R? Positions: B (1), R (2), N (3) ... then ??. But note: we cannot use A or E. Also, ""burnt"" has U? We can use U.

""Burnt"": B,U,R,N,T -> letters: B, U, R, N, T. R is at 2? Actually: B (1), U (2)? No, ""burnt"" has U at position 2? We need R at position 2. So structure: [1] R [3] [4] [5].

In ""burnt"": 
- B (1), U (2) -> but we need R at (2). So that doesn't work.

What about words with R at 2 and N at 3? For example: ""HORNS""? 
H (1), O (2) -> wait, no: H O R N S? Then R at 3? We need R at 2.

Must have R exactly at position 2.

Another: ""PRINT"": 
P (1), R (2) (good), I (3), N (4)? But we cannot place N at 4? Because it was wrong at 4 previously. So we need to put N at a different position.

But in the feedback of first guess, N was at position 4 and marked '-', meaning N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, for our second guess, putting N at position 4 again would be unwise because we know it's not there. So we must put N at one of the other positions: 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try to find words that have R at 2, N in the word but at position 1, 3, or 5, and without C, A, E.

Possible words:
- N at 1: ""N R ..."", e.g., ""NRO.."" not common. Maybe ""NURSE""? But has E? Excluded. ""NURSY"" is not a word. ""NARKS"" has A -> excluded. So difficult.

- N at 3: _ R N _ _

Let me write positions clearly: 
Word: [1] R [3] [4] [5]
We want N at position 3: [1] R N [4] [5]

What words have this pattern? Without A, C, E.

Examples: 
- ""HORNS"": H (1), O (2) -> wait, O at 2? No: H O R N S -> R is at 3? Not 2.

We need R at position 2, so the word must be: 
Position 1: any letter
Position 2: R
Position 3: N (if we choose N at 3)
Position 4 and 5: two other letters

So pattern: letter1 + R + N + letter4 + letter5

Example words: 
- ""CRONY"": C at 1? But C is excluded. 
- ""TRONK"": not a word? 
- ""DRONE"": but D (1), R(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> N is at 4? Not 3. And E is excluded.
- ""GRIND"": G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4)? Again position 4 for N -> not allowed.

Position 3: so we need N at 3? Then: [1] R N [4] [5]

What about ""WORN""? Too short. We need 5 letters.

Let me think: is there a word ""BORNS""? Not common. ""BORNS"" not a word. 
""BORNE""? But has E -> excluded.

""STERN"": S(1), T(2)? But R must be at 2? So S T E R N? Then R at 4? Not 2.

Wait, we have to put R at position 2.

Another word: ""PORNS"" -> P(1), O(2)? Then R at 3? Not 2.

What about ""GIRNS""? Not common.

Maybe shift to putting N at position 5? So pattern: [1] R [3] [4] N

Example: ""XXXRN"", e.g., ""HORNS"" again: H(1), O(2) -> R at 3? Not 2. 

To have R at 2: must be letter1 R [3] [4] N (so N at 5)

Words: ""CRWTH""? Not standard. ""GIRTH"": G(1), I(2)? Then R at 3? No.

Example: ""CURNS"" not word. ""TURNS"": T(1), U(2)? Then R at 3? No.

Maybe: ""BYRN"": too short. 

How about ""WORN""? Not 5 letters.

Perhaps we should not force N at a particular position? The feedback doesn't require that we put N in the word again? Actually, we must include N in the word?

We can try a word that has R at position 2 (because it's confirmed) and without C,A,E, and containing N at position other than 4? And we can try other common letters.

A better approach: let's list available letters.

Excluded: C, A, E -> so vowels available: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.
Consonants: avoid those.

Now, consider common letters: R is fixed at 2.

Try a word that has R at 2, and includes N at a new position (say position 1 or 3 or 5) and other letters.

Let me try words with N at position 1: 
""nR___""
Examples: ""NURDS"", but has U and D? Also has S? But E not present? But we don't know if S is in. Alternatively, ""NODUS"" -> but O at 2? Then R? No.

Not many words start with ""NR"". 

Try N at position 5: 
""____N"", with R at position 2.

Words ending with N: 
Pattern: [1] R [3] [4] N

Examples: 
- ""GR_ _ N"": GROAN -> has O and A? A excluded. 
- ""BRAWN"" -> has A? Excluded. 
- ""DRAWN"" -> has A? Excluded. 
- ""FRONT"": F(1), R(2), O(3), N(4)? Then T(5) -> but N is at position 4? Again, same position.

Avoid N at 4.

What about ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> A excluded? And A we know is excluded.

Another: ""CROWN"": C(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> pattern: C (excluded? Yes, C is excluded). So invalid.

But excluding C: we cannot use C.

Another: ""PROWN"" not a word. 

""GROWN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> N at 5. Perfect.

And G, O, W are new letters. And they are allowed? G, O, W: none of them are excluded (we excluded C,A,E).

So ""GROWN"": 
- Letters: G, R, O, W, N. 
- Positions: G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). 
- R at 2 (good), N at 5 (which is new position to test, since it wasn't at 4).

Also, we get to test G, O, W.

Therefore, a good candidate? But wait: the secret word might have duplicate letters? Unlikely? And we don't know.

So let me choose ""GROWN"" as the second guess.

Wait another possibility: ""DROWN"" -> D(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). Also all new letters D, O, W, N.

But D is a common consonant? G and D are both fine.

I think either is acceptable.

But note: in the first guess, we had N at 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting N at 5? So it's a new position.

We also test O, W, and either G or D.

Perhaps ""DROWN"" is slightly more common? But both okay.

Or ""BROWN"": B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). Also possible.

But B is also a common letter.

I think ""BROWN"", ""GROWN"", or ""DROWN"" are all reasonable.

Let me choose ""GROWN"" to have G.

So second guess: GROWN

But note: the secret word might have O or W? We don't know.

But we are testing them.

Therefore, I will guess ""grown"".

But wait, what about words with N at position 3? We skipped that. 
Pattern: [1] R N [4] [5]
Example: ""URNED"" -> has E? Excluded. ""TRND_"" ... not really. Hard to find.

Another word: ""TORNS"": T(1), O(2)? Then R at 3? No.

If we put R at 2 and N at 3: [1] R N [4] [5]
""IRNOP"" not real. So ""GROWN"" seems better.

So I go with ""grown"".

<guess>grown</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", which showed:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: correct letter and position (✓ at position 2)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: present but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

Key insights:
- The secret word has R at position 2.
- The secret word includes N but not at position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""crane"" and marked wrong position).
- The letters C, A, and E are excluded.
- Available vowels: O, I, U (and possibly Y).

For the second guess, I chose ""grown"" because:
- It keeps R in position 2 (required).
- It places N at position 5 to test a new position (since position 4 is invalid for N).
- It introduces new common letters (G, O, W) to gather more information.
- It avoids excluded letters (no C, A, E).",Guess 2: grown -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,frown,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"".
 It has C, R, A, N, E — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the secret word
- R: ✓ -> in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2)
- A: x -> not in the secret word
- N: - -> in the word but wrong position
- E: x -> not in the secret word

So, from this:
- The letter R is correct and at position 2 (so the secret word has R as the second letter).
- The letter N is in the secret word but not at position 4 (since in ""crane"" it was at position 4, but it must be in a different position).
- Letters C, A, E are excluded (since they are marked 'x'). So the secret word does not contain C, A, or E.

We need to make a second guess. We must pick a 5-letter word that:
- Has R at position 2 (since it's confirmed).
- Must include the letter N (since N is present) and put it in a position that is not 4. Also, we know N is not in position 4, but it could be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- Must not include C, A, E.

We can also consider other common letters to test.

The word must have the form: _ R _ _ _

We know the secret word has N, but not at position 4. Possible positions for N: 1, 3, or 5.

We should also try to cover other common consonants and vowels (but note that A and E are out, so vowels are limited: O, I, U are possible).

Let me think of words that fit:
- Start with: ? R ? ? ?
- Must contain N (somewhere except position 4) and not contain C, A, E.

Possibilities:
- Try to put N in position 1: ""N R ? ? ?""
- Or position 3: _ R N ? ?
- Or position 5: _ R ? ? N

But note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong position. So now, we need to avoid position 4 for N.

Also, we can test other common letters to get more information.

A good second guess might be ""ROBIN"", but wait: R is at position 2 (good) and O at 1? Let's check:

ROBIN: 
- Position 1: R? No, R must be at position 2. So ROBIN has R at position 1? Actually, R is at position 1 in ""ROBIN"", but we need R at position 2. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, let's write the positions: 
We need a word with structure: [first] R [third] [fourth] [fifth]

So for ROBIN: 
- R is at position 1 -> not at 2? So ROBIN would be: R at 1, O at 2? Then O is at position 2? But we need R at position 2. So ROBIN doesn't have R at position 2.

We must have the second letter as R.

Another idea: ""TRUNK""?
- T at 1, R at 2 (good), U at 3, N at 4, K at 5.
But in the feedback we know that N is NOT at position 4 (because in first guess it was at position 4 and marked '-', meaning it is in the word but not at that position). So we must not put N at position 4. Therefore, ""TRUNK"" would put N at position 4 again? That's the same position.

So we should avoid putting N at position 4.

What about ""DRINK""?
- D at 1, R at 2 (good), I at 3, N at 4? (but we cannot put N at position 4). So same problem.

We need to put N in a different position: either 1, 3, or 5.

Option 1: N at position 1 -> ""N R ...""
Example: ""NR..."" ... words like ""NRO"" are not words. How about ""NERVY""? But E is excluded, so cannot use E.

Option: N at position 3 -> _ R N _ _
Example words: BURNT? But U and R? Positions: B (1), R (2), N (3) ... then ??. But note: we cannot use A or E. Also, ""burnt"" has U? We can use U.

""Burnt"": B,U,R,N,T -> letters: B, U, R, N, T. R is at 2? Actually: B (1), U (2)? No, ""burnt"" has U at position 2? We need R at position 2. So structure: [1] R [3] [4] [5].

In ""burnt"": 
- B (1), U (2) -> but we need R at (2). So that doesn't work.

What about words with R at 2 and N at 3? For example: ""HORNS""? 
H (1), O (2) -> wait, no: H O R N S? Then R at 3? We need R at 2.

Must have R exactly at position 2.

Another: ""PRINT"": 
P (1), R (2) (good), I (3), N (4)? But we cannot place N at 4? Because it was wrong at 4 previously. So we need to put N at a different position.

But in the feedback of first guess, N was at position 4 and marked '-', meaning N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, for our second guess, putting N at position 4 again would be unwise because we know it's not there. So we must put N at one of the other positions: 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try to find words that have R at 2, N in the word but at position 1, 3, or 5, and without C, A, E.

Possible words:
- N at 1: ""N R ..."", e.g., ""NRO.."" not common. Maybe ""NURSE""? But has E? Excluded. ""NURSY"" is not a word. ""NARKS"" has A -> excluded. So difficult.

- N at 3: _ R N _ _
Examples: ""IRONY"" -> I (1), R (2), O (3)? Wait, no: I R O N Y? Then letters: I (1), R (2), O (3), N (4), Y (5). But again, N is at position 4? We don't want that.

Let me write positions clearly: 
Word: [1] R [3] [4] [5]
We want N at position 3: [1] R N [4] [5]

What words have this pattern? Without A, C, E.

Examples: 
- ""HORNS"": H (1), O (2) -> wait, O at 2? No: H O R N S -> R is at 3? Not 2.

We need R at position 2, so the word must be: 
Position 1: any letter
Position 2: R
Position 3: N (if we choose N at 3)
Position 4 and 5: two other letters

So pattern: letter1 + R + N + letter4 + letter5

Example words: 
- ""CRONY"": C at 1? But C is excluded. 
- ""TRONK"": not a word? 
- ""DRONE"": but D (1), R(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> N is at 4? Not 3. And E is excluded.
- ""GRIND"": G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4)? Again position 4 for N -> not allowed.

Position 3: so we need N at 3? Then: [1] R N [4] [5]

What about ""WORN""? Too short. We need 5 letters.

Let me think: is there a word ""BORNS""? Not common. ""BORNS"" not a word. 
""BORNE""? But has E -> excluded.

""STERN"": S(1), T(2)? But R must be at 2? So S T E R N? Then R at 4? Not 2.

Wait, we have to put R at position 2.

Another word: ""PORNS"" -> P(1), O(2)? Then R at 3? Not 2.

What about ""GIRNS""? Not common.

Maybe shift to putting N at position 5? So pattern: [1] R [3] [4] N

Example: ""XXXRN"", e.g., ""HORNS"" again: H(1), O(2) -> R at 3? Not 2. 

To have R at 2: must be letter1 R [3] [4] N (so N at 5)

Words: ""CRWTH""? Not standard. ""GIRTH"": G(1), I(2)? Then R at 3? No.

Example: ""CURNS"" not word. ""TURNS"": T(1), U(2)? Then R at 3? No.

Maybe: ""BYRN"": too short. 

How about ""WORN""? Not 5 letters.

Perhaps we should not force N at a particular position? The feedback doesn't require that we put N in the word again? Actually, we must include N in the word? No, but the feedback says that N is in the secret word, so we need to account for that. But for the second guess, we are not forced to include N? Actually, no rule says we must include known letters? However, it's beneficial to try to locate the position.

But we know N is in the word (somewhere) so we can try a word that has N at a different position to test.

However, we also want as much new information as possible: testing other consonants and vowels.

We can try a word that has R at position 2 (because it's confirmed) and without C,A,E, and containing N at position other than 4? And we can try other common letters.

A better approach: let's list available letters.

Excluded: C, A, E -> so vowels available: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.
Consonants: avoid those.

Now, consider common letters: R is fixed at 2.

Try a word that has R at 2, and includes N at a new position (say position 1 or 3 or 5) and other letters.

Let me try words with N at position 1: 
""nR___""
Examples: ""NURDS"", but has U and D? Also has S? But E not present? But we don't know if S is in. Alternatively, ""NODUS"" -> but O at 2? Then R? No.

Not many words start with ""NR"". 

Try N at position 5: 
""____N"", with R at position 2.

Words ending with N: 
Pattern: [1] R [3] [4] N

Examples: 
- ""GR_ _ N"": GROAN -> has O and A? A excluded. 
- ""BRAWN"" -> has A? Excluded. 
- ""DRAWN"" -> has A? Excluded. 
- ""FRONT"": F(1), R(2), O(3), N(4)? Then T(5) -> but N is at position 4? Again, same position.

Avoid N at 4.

What about ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> A excluded? And A we know is excluded.

Another: ""CROWN"": C(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> pattern: C (excluded? Yes, C is excluded). So invalid.

But excluding C: we cannot use C.

Another: ""PROWN"" not a word. 

""GROWN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> N at 5. Perfect.

And G, O, W are new letters. And they are allowed? G, O, W: none of them are excluded (we excluded C,A,E).

So ""GROWN"": 
- Letters: G, R, O, W, N. 
- Positions: G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). 
- R at 2 (good), N at 5 (which is new position to test, since it wasn't at 4).

Also, we get to test G, O, W.

Therefore, a good candidate? But wait: the secret word might have duplicate letters? Unlikely? And we don't know.

So let me choose ""GROWN"" as the second guess.

Wait another possibility: ""DROWN"" -> D(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). Also all new letters D, O, W, N.

But D is a common consonant? G and D are both fine.

I think either is acceptable.

But note: in the first guess, we had N at 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting N at 5? So it's a new position.

We also test O, W, and either G or D.

Perhaps ""DROWN"" is slightly more common? But both okay.

Or ""BROWN"": B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). Also possible.

But B is also a common letter.

I think ""BROWN"", ""GROWN"", or ""DROWN"" are all reasonable.

Let me choose ""GROWN"" to have G.

So second guess: GROWN

But note: the secret word might have O or W? We don't know.

But we are testing them.

Therefore, I will guess ""grown"".

But wait, what about words with N at position 3? We skipped that. 
Pattern: [1] R N [4] [5]
Example: ""URNED"" -> has E? Excluded. ""TRND_"" ... not really. Hard to find.

Another word: ""TORNS"": T(1), O(2)? Then R at 3? No.

If we put R at 2 and N at 3: [1] R N [4] [5]
""IRNOP"" not real. So ""GROWN"" seems better.

So I go with ""grown"".

- C: not in the word (x)
- R: correct letter and position (✓ at position 2)

But C is excluded. \n- ""TRONK"": not a word? \n- ""DRONE"": but D (1), R(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> N is at 4? Not 3. And E is excluded.\n- ""GRIND"": G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4)? Again position 4 for N -> not allowed.\n\nPosition 3: so we need N at 3? Then: [1] R N [4] [5]\n\nWhat about ""WORN""? Too short. We need 5 letters.\n\nLet me think: is there a word ""BORNS""? Not common. ""BORNS"" not a word. \n""BORNE""? But has E -> excluded.\n\n""STERN"": S(1), T(2)? But R must be at 2? So S T E R N? Then R at 4? Not 2.\n\nWait, we have to put R at position 2.\n\nAnother word: ""PORNS"" -> P(1), O(2)? Then R at 3? Not 2.\n\nWhat about ""GIRNS""? Not common.\n\nMaybe shift to putting N at position 5? So pattern: [1] R [3] [4] N\n\nExample: ""XXXRN"", e.g., ""HORNS"" again: H(1), O(2) -> R at 3? Not 2. \n\nTo have R at 2: must be letter1 R [3] [4] N (so N at 5)\n\nWords: ""CRWTH""? Not standard. ""GIRTH"": G(1), I(2)? Then R at 3? No.\n\nExample: ""CURNS"" not word. ""TURNS"": T(1), U(2)? Then R at 3? No.\n\nMaybe: ""BYRN"": too short. \n\nHow about ""WORN""? Not 5 letters.\n\nPerhaps we should not force N at a particular position? The feedback doesn\'t require that we put N in the word again? Actually, we must include N in the word? No, but the feedback says that N is in the secret word, so we need to account for that. But for the second guess, we are not forced to include N? Actually, no rule says we must include known letters? However, it\'s beneficial to try to locate the position.\n\nBut we know N is in the word (somewhere) so we can try a word that has N at a different position to test.\n\nHowever, we also want as much new information as possible: testing other consonants and vowels.\n\nWe can try a word that has R at position 2 (because it\'s confirmed) and without C,A,E, and containing N at position other than 4? And we can try other common letters.\n\nA better approach: let\'s list available letters.\n\nExcluded: C, A, E -> so vowels available: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.\nConsonants: avoid those.\n\nNow, consider common letters: R is fixed at 2.\n\nTry a word that has R at 2, and includes N at a new position (say position 1 or 3 or 5) and other letters.\n\nLet me try words with N at position 1: \n""nR___""\nExamples: ""NURDS"", but has U and D? Also has S? But E not present? But we don\'t know if S is in. Alternatively, ""NODUS"" -> but O at 2? Then R? No.\n\nNot many words start with ""NR"". \n\nTry N at position 5: \n""____N"", with R at position 2.\n\nWords ending with N: \nPattern: [1] R [3] [4] N\n\nExamples: \n- ""GR_ _ N"": GROAN -> has O and A? A excluded. \n- ""BRAWN"" -> has A? Excluded. \n- ""DRAWN"" -> has A? Excluded. \n- ""FRONT"": F(1), R(2), O(3), N(4)? Then T(5) -> but N is at position 4? Again, same position.\n\nAvoid N at 4.\n\nWhat about ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> A excluded? And A we know is excluded.\n\nAnother: ""CROWN"": C(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> pattern: C (excluded? Yes, C is excluded). So invalid.\n\nBut excluding C: we cannot use C.\n\nAnother: ""PROWN"" not a word. \n\n""GROWN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> N at 5. Perfect.\n\nAnd G, O, W are new letters. And they are allowed? G, O, W: none of them are excluded (we excluded C,A,E).\n\nSo ""GROWN"": \n- Letters: G, R, O, W, N. \n- Positions: G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). \n- R at 2 (good), N at 5 (which is new position to test, since it wasn\'t at 4).\n\nAlso, we get to test G, O, W.\n\nTherefore, a good candidate? But wait: the secret word might have duplicate letters? Unlikely? And we don\'t know.\n\nSo let me choose ""GROWN"" as the second guess.\n\nWait another possibility: ""DROWN"" -> D(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). Also all new letters D, O, W, N.\n\nBut D is a common consonant? G and D are both fine.\n\nI think either is acceptable.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had N at 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting N at 5? So it\'s a new position.\n\nWe also test O, W, and either G or D.\n\nPerhaps ""DROWN"" is slightly more common? But both okay.\n\nOr ""BROWN"": B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). Also possible.\n\nBut B is also a common letter.\n\nI think ""BROWN"", ""GROWN"", or ""DROWN"" are all reasonable.\n\nLet me choose ""GROWN"" to have G.\n\nSo second guess: GROWN\n\nBut note: the secret word might have O or W? We don\'t know.\n\nBut we are testing them.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""grown"".\n\nBut wait, what about words with N at position 3? We skipped that. \nPattern: [1] R N [4] [5]\nExample: ""URNED"" -> has E? Excluded. ""TRND_"" ... not really. Hard to find.\n\nAnother word: ""TORNS"": T(1), O(2)? Then R at 3? No.\n\nIf we put R at 2 and N at 3: [1] R N [4] [5]\n""IRNOP"" not real. So ""GROWN"" seems better.\n\nSo I go with ""grown"".\n\n<guess>grown</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", which showed:\n- C: not in the word (x)\n- R: correct letter and position (✓ at position 2)\n- A: not in the word (x)\n- N: present but wrong position (-)\n- E: not in the word (x)\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word has R at position 2.\n- The secret word includes N but not at position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""crane"" and marked wrong position).\n- The letters C, A, and E are excluded.\n- Available vowels: O, I, U (and possibly Y).\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""grown"" because:\n- It keeps R in position 2 (required).\n- It places N at position 5 to test a new position (since position 4 is invalid for N).\n- It introduces new common letters (G, O, W) to gather more information.\n- It avoids excluded letters (no C, A, E).\n\n<guess>grown</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: grown -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so position 2 is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word, but not at position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from guess 1:
- The secret word has R at position 2.
- The secret word contains N, but not at position 4.
- The letters C, A, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""grown""
- G: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so position 2 is R, which we already knew)
- O: ✓ (correct position, so position 3 is O)
- W: ✓ (correct position, so position 4 is W)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so position 5 is N)

This is a significant update! The feedback for ""grown"" shows that O, W, and N are in the correct positions (3, 4, and 5 respectively). Also, G is not in the word.

So, putting it together:
- Position 2: R (from both guesses)
- Position 3: O (from guess 2)
- Position 4: W (from guess 2)
- Position 5: N (from guess 2)

We also know that position 1 must be a letter that is not C, A, E, or G (from the x's). Also, the secret word must not contain any of the excluded letters.

Now, what about position 1? We don't have any information about it yet, except that it cannot be C, A, E, or G.

Moreover, we know the entire word except the first letter: _ R O W N

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: [letter] R O W N

And the first letter must be a letter that is not excluded and forms a valid English word.

Excluded letters so far: C, A, E, G.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had N in the word (but not at position 4) and now we have it at position 5, which is consistent.

Now, what are the possible words? Let's list common words ending with ""ROWN"":

- Brown: B is not excluded? B is not in the excluded list. So ""BROWN"" is a candidate.
- Crown: But C is excluded, so not possible.
- Drown: D is not excluded? D is not in the excluded list. So ""DROWN"" is a candidate.
- Frown: F is not excluded? F is not excluded. So ""FROWN"" is a candidate.
- Grown: We already guessed it, and it had G which is excluded? In guess 2, G was marked x, so G is not in the word. But ""grown"" is the word we guessed, and we know it's not the secret word because we got feedback and it's not all green? Actually, the feedback for ""grown"" had G as x, so the secret word is not ""grown"". Also, we have three correct: R, O, W, N, but G is wrong. So the secret word must be a different word with the same last four letters? But the last four are R, O, W, N? Actually, positions: 2,3,4,5 are R,O,W,N. So the word is ?ROWN.

Possible first letters: any letter except C, A, E, G, and it must form a valid word.

Common words:
- Brown (B)
- Drown (D)
- Frown (F)
- Prown? Not a word.
- Trown? Not a word.

So the candidates are: BROWN, DROWN, FROWN.

We need to choose one to guess. Since we have three possibilities, we can pick one arbitrarily? But note, we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on guess 3, and we have 6 tries total, so we can try.

But we can also think about which one is more common? Or we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? However, we already have four letters fixed, so we can just guess one of them.

Alternatively, we can use a word that includes the possible first letters? But that might be inefficient.

Since we have three options, and we are at guess 3, we can guess one and see.

But note: we have not tested the letters B, D, F at all. So we don't know if they are in the word? Actually, the secret word has only one unknown letter: the first one. And it must be one of B, D, F? Because the words are BROWN, DROWN, FROWN.

So we can guess one of them.

To be safe, we can choose the most common one: ""brown"" is a very common word.

But let me check: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong? But in the secret word, if it is ""brown"", then N is at position 5? That matches because in ""crane"" we had N at 4 and it was wrong, and in ""brown"" it is at 5.

Similarly for the others.

So I think we can guess ""brown"".

But wait, what if the word is ""drown"" or ""frown""? Then we'll know from the feedback.

Alternatively, we could use a word that tests multiple, but that might not be necessary.

Since we have the pattern, we can just guess one.

I think ""brown"" is a good guess.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. All of BROWN, DROWN, FROWN are valid.

So I'll go with ""brown"".

But let me double-check the feedback: in guess 2, we had ""grown"" and got G(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓). So the secret word must be a word that has R at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5, and the first letter is not G and not any of the excluded.

So yes, it must be one of BROWN, DROWN, FROWN.

Therefore, I'll guess ""brown"" as the third guess.

Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(correct position), A(not in word), N(in word but wrong position), E(not in word).  
  - This tells us:  
    - R is in the secret word and in position 2.  
    - N is in the secret word but not in position 4.  
    - C, A, and E are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""grown""** → Feedback: G(not in word), R(correct position), O(correct position), W(correct position), N(correct position).  
  - This tells us:  
    - R, O, W, and N are all in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively).  
    - G is not in the secret word.  

### Analysis:
- The secret word has the pattern: `[1] R O W N`, where `[1]` is an unknown letter.  
- The first letter must be a valid English letter that forms a 5-letter word.  
- Excluded letters (from feedback): C, A, E, G (since they were marked as ""not in word"" in previous guesses).  
- Possible words fitting the pattern and exclusions:  
  - **BROWN**: B is not excluded.  
  - **DROWN**: D is not excluded.  
  - **FROWN**: F is not excluded.  
- Since the feedback confirms positions 2–5 are R, O, W, N, the secret word must be one of these three options.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- With only the first letter unknown, the most efficient approach is to guess one of the candidate words directly.  
- ""BROWN"" is a common word and a reasonable choice to test first.  
- If incorrect, the feedback will confirm or eliminate B, allowing us to deduce the secret word in the next guess (e.g., if B is wrong, it must be DROWN or FROWN).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"".
 It has C, R, A, N, E — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the secret word
- R: ✓ -> in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2)
- A: x -> not in the secret word
- N: - -> in the word but wrong position
- E: x -> not in the secret word

So, from this:
- The letter R is correct and at position 2 (so the secret word has R as the second letter).
- The letter N is in the secret word but not at position 4 (since in ""crane"" it was at position 4, but it must be in a different position).
- Letters C, A, E are excluded (since they are marked 'x'). So the secret word does not contain C, A, or E.

We need to make a second guess. We must pick a 5-letter word that:
- Has R at position 2 (since it's confirmed).
- Must include the letter N (since N is present) and put it in a position that is not 4. Also, we know N is not in position 4, but it could be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- Must not include C, A, E.

We can also consider other common letters to test.

The word must have the form: _ R _ _ _

We know the secret word has N, but not at position 4. Possible positions for N: 1, 3, or 5.

We should also try to cover other common consonants and vowels (but note that A and E are out, so vowels are limited: O, I, U are possible).

Let me think of words that fit:
- Start with: ? R ? ? ?
- Must contain N (somewhere except position 4) and not contain C, A, E.

Possibilities:
- Try to put N in position 1: ""N R ? ? ?""
- Or position 3: _ R N ? ?
- Or position 5: _ R ? ? N

But note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong position. So now, we need to avoid position 4 for N.

Also, we can test other common letters to get more information.

A good second guess might be ""ROBIN"", but wait: R is at position 2 (good) and O at 1? Let's check:

ROBIN: 
- Position 1: R? No, R must be at position 2. So ROBIN has R at position 1? Actually, R is at position 1 in ""ROBIN"", but we need R at position 2. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, let's write the positions: 
We need a word with structure: [first] R [third] [fourth] [fifth]

So for ROBIN: 
- R is at position 1 -> not at 2? So ROBIN would be: R at 1, O at 2? Then O is at position 2? But we need R at position 2. So ROBIN doesn't have R at position 2.

We must have the second letter as R.

Another idea: ""TRUNK""?
- T at 1, R at 2 (good), U at 3, N at 4, K at 5.
But in the feedback we know that N is NOT at position 4 (because in first guess it was at position 4 and marked '-', meaning it is in the word but not at that position). So we must not put N at position 4. Therefore, ""TRUNK"" would put N at position 4 again? That's the same position.

So we should avoid putting N at position 4.

What about ""DRINK""?
- D at 1, R at 2 (good), I at 3, N at 4? (but we cannot put N at position 4). So same problem.

We need to put N in a different position: either 1, 3, or 5.

Option 1: N at position 1 -> ""N R ...""
Example: ""NR..."" ... words like ""NRO"" are not words. How about ""NERVY""? But E is excluded, so cannot use E.

Option: N at position 3 -> _ R N _ _
Example words: BURNT? But U and R? Positions: B (1), R (2), N (3) ... then ??. But note: we cannot use A or E. Also, ""burnt"" has U? We can use U.

""Burnt"": B,U,R,N,T -> letters: B, U, R, N, T. R is at 2? Actually: B (1), U (2)? No, ""burnt"" has U at position 2? We need R at position 2. So structure: [1] R [3] [4] [5].

In ""burnt"": 
- B (1), U (2) -> but we need R at (2). So that doesn't work.

What about words with R at 2 and N at 3? For example: ""HORNS""? 
H (1), O (2) -> wait, no: H O R N S? Then R at 3? We need R at 2.

Must have R exactly at position 2.

Another: ""PRINT"": 
P (1), R (2) (good), I (3), N (4)? But we cannot place N at 4? Because it was wrong at 4 previously. So we need to put N at a different position.

But in the feedback of first guess, N was at position 4 and marked '-', meaning N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, for our second guess, putting N at position 4 again would be unwise because we know it's not there. So we must put N at one of the other positions: 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try to find words that have R at 2, N in the word but at position 1, 3, or 5, and without C, A, E.

Possible words:
- N at 1: ""N R ..."", e.g., ""NRO.."" not common. Maybe ""NURSE""? But has E? Excluded. ""NURSY"" is not a word. ""NARKS"" has A -> excluded. So difficult.

- N at 3: _ R N _ _
Examples: ""IRONY"" -> I (1), R (2), O (3)? Wait, no: I R O N Y? Then letters: I (1), R (2), O (3), N (4), Y (5). But again, N is at position 4? We don't want that.

Let me write positions clearly: 
Word: [1] R [3] [4] [5]
We want N at position 3: [1] R N [4] [5]

What words have this pattern? Without A, C, E.

Examples: 
- ""HORNS"": H (1), O (2) -> wait, O at 2? No: H O R N S -> R is at 3? Not 2.

We need R at position 2, so the word must be: 
Position 1: any letter
Position 2: R
Position 3: N (if we choose N at 3)
Position 4 and 5: two other letters

So pattern: letter1 + R + N + letter4 + letter5

Example words: 
- ""CRONY"": C at 1? But C is excluded. 
- ""TRONK"": not a word? 
- ""DRONE"": but D (1), R(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> N is at 4? Not 3. And E is excluded.
- ""GRIND"": G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4)? Again position 4 for N -> not allowed.

Position 3: so we need N at 3? Then: [1] R N [4] [5]

What about ""WORN""? Too short. We need 5 letters.

Let me think: is there a word ""BORNS""? Not common. ""BORNS"" not a word. 
""BORNE""? But has E -> excluded.

""STERN"": S(1), T(2)? But R must be at 2? So S T E R N? Then R at 4? Not 2.

Wait, we have to put R at position 2.

Another word: ""PORNS"" -> P(1), O(2)? Then R at 3? Not 2.

What about ""GIRNS""? Not common.

Maybe shift to putting N at position 5? So pattern: [1] R [3] [4] N

Example: ""XXXRN"", e.g., ""HORNS"" again: H(1), O(2) -> R at 3? Not 2. 

To have R at 2: must be letter1 R [3] [4] N (so N at 5)

Words: ""CRWTH""? Not standard. ""GIRTH"": G(1), I(2)? Then R at 3? No.

Example: ""CURNS"" not word. ""TURNS"": T(1), U(2)? Then R at 3? No.

Maybe: ""BYRN"": too short. 

How about ""WORN""? Not 5 letters.

Perhaps we should not force N at a particular position? The feedback doesn't require that we put N in the word again? Actually, we must include N in the word? No, but the feedback says that N is in the secret word, so we need to account for that. But for the second guess, we are not forced to include N? Actually, no rule says we must include known letters? However, it's beneficial to try to locate the position.

But we know N is in the word (somewhere) so we can try a word that has N at a different position to test.

However, we also want as much new information as possible: testing other consonants and vowels.

We can try a word that has R at position 2 (because it's confirmed) and without C,A,E, and containing N at position other than 4? And we can try other common letters.

A better approach: let's list available letters.

Excluded: C, A, E -> so vowels available: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.
Consonants: avoid those.

Now, consider common letters: R is fixed at 2.

Try a word that has R at 2, and includes N at a new position (say position 1 or 3 or 5) and other letters.

Let me try words with N at position 1: 
""nR___""
Examples: ""NURDS"", but has U and D? Also has S? But E not present? But we don't know if S is in. Alternatively, ""NODUS"" -> but O at 2? Then R? No.

Not many words start with ""NR"". 

Try N at position 5: 
""____N"", with R at position 2.

Words ending with N: 
Pattern: [1] R [3] [4] N

Examples: 
- ""GR_ _ N"": GROAN -> has O and A? A excluded. 
- ""BRAWN"" -> has A? Excluded. 
- ""DRAWN"" -> has A? Excluded. 
- ""FRONT"": F(1), R(2), O(3), N(4)? Then T(5) -> but N is at position 4? Again, same position.

Avoid N at 4.

What about ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> A excluded? And A we know is excluded.

Another: ""CROWN"": C(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> pattern: C (excluded? Yes, C is excluded). So invalid.

But excluding C: we cannot use C.

Another: ""PROWN"" not a word. 

""GROWN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> N at 5. Perfect.

And G, O, W are new letters. And they are allowed? G, O, W: none of them are excluded (we excluded C,A,E).

So ""GROWN"": 
- Letters: G, R, O, W, N. 
- Positions: G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). 
- R at 2 (good), N at 5 (which is new position to test, since it wasn't at 4).

Also, we get to test G, O, W.

Therefore, a good candidate? But wait: the secret word might have duplicate letters? Unlikely? And we don't know.

So let me choose ""GROWN"" as the second guess.

Wait another possibility: ""DROWN"" -> D(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). Also all new letters D, O, W, N.

But D is a common consonant? G and D are both fine.

I think either is acceptable.

But note: in the first guess, we had N at 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting N at 5? So it's a new position.

We also test O, W, and either G or D.

Perhaps ""DROWN"" is slightly more common? But both okay.

Or ""BROWN"": B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). Also possible.

But B is also a common letter.

I think ""BROWN"", ""GROWN"", or ""DROWN"" are all reasonable.

Let me choose ""GROWN"" to have G.

So second guess: GROWN

But note: the secret word might have O or W? We don't know.

But we are testing them.

Therefore, I will guess ""grown"".

But wait, what about words with N at position 3? We skipped that. 
Pattern: [1] R N [4] [5]
Example: ""URNED"" -> has E? Excluded. ""TRND_"" ... not really. Hard to find.

Another word: ""TORNS"": T(1), O(2)? Then R at 3? No.

If we put R at 2 and N at 3: [1] R N [4] [5]
""IRNOP"" not real. So ""GROWN"" seems better.

So I go with ""grown"".

<guess>grown</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", which showed:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: correct letter and position (✓ at position 2)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: present but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

Key insights:
- The secret word has R at position 2.
- The secret word includes N but not at position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""crane"" and marked wrong position).
- The letters C, A, and E are excluded.
- Available vowels: O, I, U (and possibly Y).

For the second guess, I chose ""grown"" because:
- It keeps R in position 2 (required).
- It places N at position 5 to test a new position (since position 4 is invalid for N).
- It introduces new common letters (G, O, W) to gather more information.
- It avoids excluded letters (no C, A, E).

<guess>grown</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: grown -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so position 2 is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word, but not at position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from guess 1:
- The secret word has R at position 2.
- The secret word contains N, but not at position 4.
- The letters C, A, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""grown""
- G: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so position 2 is R, which we already knew)
- O: ✓ (correct position, so position 3 is O)
- W: ✓ (correct position, so position 4 is W)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so position 5 is N)

This is a significant update! The feedback for ""grown"" shows that O, W, and N are in the correct positions (3, 4, and 5 respectively). Also, G is not in the word.

So, putting it together:
- Position 2: R (from both guesses)
- Position 3: O (from guess 2)
- Position 4: W (from guess 2)
- Position 5: N (from guess 2)

We also know that position 1 must be a letter that is not C, A, E, or G (from the x's). Also, the secret word must not contain any of the excluded letters.

Now, what about position 1? We don't have any information about it yet, except that it cannot be C, A, E, or G.

Moreover, we know the entire word except the first letter: _ R O W N

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: [letter] R O W N

And the first letter must be a letter that is not excluded and forms a valid English word.

Excluded letters so far: C, A, E, G.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had N in the word (but not at position 4) and now we have it at position 5, which is consistent.

Now, what are the possible words? Let's list common words ending with ""ROWN"":

- Brown: B is not excluded? B is not in the excluded list. So ""BROWN"" is a candidate.
- Crown: But C is excluded, so not possible.
- Drown: D is not excluded? D is not in the excluded list. So ""DROWN"" is a candidate.
- Frown: F is not excluded? F is not excluded. So ""FROWN"" is a candidate.
- Grown: We already guessed it, and it had G which is excluded? In guess 2, G was marked x, so G is not in the word. But ""grown"" is the word we guessed, and we know it's not the secret word because we got feedback and it's not all green? Actually, the feedback for ""grown"" had G as x, so the secret word is not ""grown"". Also, we have three correct: R, O, W, N, but G is wrong. So the secret word must be a different word with the same last four letters? But the last four are R, O, W, N? Actually, positions: 2,3,4,5 are R,O,W,N. So the word is ?ROWN.

Possible first letters: any letter except C, A, E, G, and it must form a valid word.

Common words:
- Brown (B)
- Drown (D)
- Frown (F)
- Prown? Not a word.
- Trown? Not a word.

So the candidates are: BROWN, DROWN, FROWN.

We need to choose one to guess. Since we have three possibilities, we can pick one arbitrarily? But note, we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on guess 3, and we have 6 tries total, so we can try.

But we can also think about which one is more common? Or we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? However, we already have four letters fixed, so we can just guess one of them.

Alternatively, we can use a word that includes the possible first letters? But that might be inefficient.

Since we have three options, and we are at guess 3, we can guess one and see.

But note: we have not tested the letters B, D, F at all. So we don't know if they are in the word? Actually, the secret word has only one unknown letter: the first one. And it must be one of B, D, F? Because the words are BROWN, DROWN, FROWN.

So we can guess one of them.

To be safe, we can choose the most common one: ""brown"" is a very common word.

But let me check: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong? But in the secret word, if it is ""brown"", then N is at position 5? That matches because in ""crane"" we had N at 4 and it was wrong, and in ""brown"" it is at 5.

Similarly for the others.

So I think we can guess ""brown"".

But wait, what if the word is ""drown"" or ""frown""? Then we'll know from the feedback.

Alternatively, we could use a word that tests multiple, but that might not be necessary.

Since we have the pattern, we can just guess one.

I think ""brown"" is a good guess.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. All of BROWN, DROWN, FROWN are valid.

So I'll go with ""brown"".

But let me double-check the feedback: in guess 2, we had ""grown"" and got G(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓). So the secret word must be a word that has R at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5, and the first letter is not G and not any of the excluded.

So yes, it must be one of BROWN, DROWN, FROWN.

Therefore, I'll guess ""brown"" as the third guess.

<guess>brown</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(correct position), A(not in word), N(in word but wrong position), E(not in word).  
  - This tells us:  
    - R is in the secret word and in position 2.  
    - N is in the secret word but not in position 4.  
    - C, A, and E are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""grown""** → Feedback: G(not in word), R(correct position), O(correct position), W(correct position), N(correct position).  
  - This tells us:  
    - R, O, W, and N are all in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively).  
    - G is not in the secret word.  

### Analysis:
- The secret word has the pattern: `[1] R O W N`, where `[1]` is an unknown letter.  
- The first letter must be a valid English letter that forms a 5-letter word.  
- Excluded letters (from feedback): C, A, E, G (since they were marked as ""not in word"" in previous guesses).  
- Possible words fitting the pattern and exclusions:  
  - **BROWN**: B is not excluded.  
  - **DROWN**: D is not excluded.  
  - **FROWN**: F is not excluded.  
- Since the feedback confirms positions 2–5 are R, O, W, N, the secret word must be one of these three options.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- With only the first letter unknown, the most efficient approach is to guess one of the candidate words directly.  
- ""BROWN"" is a common word and a reasonable choice to test first.  
- If incorrect, the feedback will confirm or eliminate B, allowing us to deduce the secret word in the next guess (e.g., if B is wrong, it must be DROWN or FROWN).

And A we know is excluded.\n\nAnother: ""CROWN"": C(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> pattern: C (excluded? Yes, C is excluded). So invalid.\n\nBut excluding C: we cannot use C.\n\nAnother: ""PROWN"" not a word. \n\n""GROWN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> N at 5. Perfect.\n\nAnd G, O, W are new letters. And they are allowed? G, O, W: none of them are excluded (we excluded C,A,E).\n\nSo ""GROWN"": \n- Letters: G, R, O, W, N. \n- Positions: G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). \n- R at 2 (good), N at 5 (which is new position to test, since it wasn\'t at 4).\n\nAlso, we get to test G, O, W.\n\nTherefore, a good candidate? But wait: the secret word might have duplicate letters? Unlikely? And we don\'t know.\n\nSo let me choose ""GROWN"" as the second guess.\n\nWait another possibility: ""DROWN"" -> D(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). Also all new letters D, O, W, N.\n\nBut D is a common consonant? G and D are both fine.\n\nI think either is acceptable.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had N at 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting N at 5? So it\'s a new position.\n\nWe also test O, W, and either G or D.\n\nPerhaps ""DROWN"" is slightly more common? But both okay.\n\nOr ""BROWN"": B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). Also possible.\n\nBut B is also a common letter.\n\nI think ""BROWN"", ""GROWN"", or ""DROWN"" are all reasonable.\n\nLet me choose ""GROWN"" to have G.\n\nSo second guess: GROWN\n\nBut note: the secret word might have O or W? We don\'t know.\n\nBut we are testing them.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""grown"".\n\nBut wait, what about words with N at position 3? We skipped that. \nPattern: [1] R N [4] [5]\nExample: ""URNED"" -> has E? Excluded. ""TRND_"" ... not really. Hard to find.\n\nAnother word: ""TORNS"": T(1), O(2)? Then R at 3? No.\n\nIf we put R at 2 and N at 3: [1] R N [4] [5]\n""IRNOP"" not real. So ""GROWN"" seems better.\n\nSo I go with ""grown"".\n\n<guess>grown</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", which showed:\n- C: not in the word (x)\n- R: correct letter and position (✓ at position 2)\n- A: not in the word (x)\n- N: present but wrong position (-)\n- E: not in the word (x)\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word has R at position 2.\n- The secret word includes N but not at position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""crane"" and marked wrong position).\n- The letters C, A, and E are excluded.\n- Available vowels: O, I, U (and possibly Y).\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""grown"" because:\n- It keeps R in position 2 (required).\n- It places N at position 5 to test a new position (since position 4 is invalid for N).\n- It introduces new common letters (G, O, W) to gather more information.\n- It avoids excluded letters (no C, A, E).\n\n<guess>grown</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: grown -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, so position 2 is R)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: - (in the word, but not at position 4)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from guess 1:\n- The secret word has R at position 2.\n- The secret word contains N, but not at position 4.\n- The letters C, A, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""grown""\n- G: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, so position 2 is R, which we already knew)\n- O: ✓ (correct position, so position 3 is O)\n- W: ✓ (correct position, so position 4 is W)\n- N: ✓ (correct position, so position 5 is N)\n\nThis is a significant update! The feedback for ""grown"" shows that O, W, and N are in the correct positions (3, 4, and 5 respectively). Also, G is not in the word.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n- Position 2: R (from both guesses)\n- Position 3: O (from guess 2)\n- Position 4: W (from guess 2)\n- Position 5: N (from guess 2)\n\nWe also know that position 1 must be a letter that is not C, A, E, or G (from the x\'s). Also, the secret word must not contain any of the excluded letters.\n\nNow, what about position 1? We don\'t have any information about it yet, except that it cannot be C, A, E, or G.\n\nMoreover, we know the entire word except the first letter: _ R O W N\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that fits: [letter] R O W N\n\nAnd the first letter must be a letter that is not excluded and forms a valid English word.\n\nExcluded letters so far: C, A, E, G.\n\nAlso, note that in the first guess, we had N in the word (but not at position 4) and now we have it at position 5, which is consistent.\n\nNow, what are the possible words? Let\'s list common words ending with ""ROWN"":\n\n- Brown: B is not excluded? B is not in the excluded list. So ""BROWN"" is a candidate.\n- Crown: But C is excluded, so not possible.\n- Drown: D is not excluded? D is not in the excluded list. So ""DROWN"" is a candidate.\n- Frown: F is not excluded? F is not excluded. So ""FROWN"" is a candidate.\n- Grown: We already guessed it, and it had G which is excluded? In guess 2, G was marked x, so G is not in the word. But ""grown"" is the word we guessed, and we know it\'s not the secret word because we got feedback and it\'s not all green? Actually, the feedback for ""grown"" had G as x, so the secret word is not ""grown"". Also, we have three correct: R, O, W, N, but G is wrong. So the secret word must be a different word with the same last four letters? But the last four are R, O, W, N? Actually, positions: 2,3,4,5 are R,O,W,N. So the word is ?ROWN.\n\nPossible first letters: any letter except C, A, E, G, and it must form a valid word.\n\nCommon words:\n- Brown (B)\n- Drown (D)\n- Frown (F)\n- Prown? Not a word.\n- Trown? Not a word.\n\nSo the candidates are: BROWN, DROWN, FROWN.\n\nWe need to choose one to guess. Since we have three possibilities, we can pick one arbitrarily? But note, we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on guess 3, and we have 6 tries total, so we can try.\n\nBut we can also think about which one is more common? Or we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? However, we already have four letters fixed, so we can just guess one of them.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that includes the possible first letters? But that might be inefficient.\n\nSince we have three options, and we are at guess 3, we can guess one and see.\n\nBut note: we have not tested the letters B, D, F at all. So we don\'t know if they are in the word? Actually, the secret word has only one unknown letter: the first one. And it must be one of B, D, F? Because the words are BROWN, DROWN, FROWN.\n\nSo we can guess one of them.\n\nTo be safe, we can choose the most common one: ""brown"" is a very common word.\n\nBut let me check: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong? But in the secret word, if it is ""brown"", then N is at position 5? That matches because in ""crane"" we had N at 4 and it was wrong, and in ""brown"" it is at 5.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nSo I think we can guess ""brown"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word is ""drown"" or ""frown""? Then we\'ll know from the feedback.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word that tests multiple, but that might not be necessary.\n\nSince we have the pattern, we can just guess one.\n\nI think ""brown"" is a good guess.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. All of BROWN, DROWN, FROWN are valid.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""brown"".\n\nBut let me double-check the feedback: in guess 2, we had ""grown"" and got G(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓). So the secret word must be a word that has R at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5, and the first letter is not G and not any of the excluded.\n\nSo yes, it must be one of BROWN, DROWN, FROWN.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""brown"" as the third guess.\n\n<guess>brown</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(correct position), A(not in word), N(in word but wrong position), E(not in word).  \n  - This tells us:  \n    - R is in the secret word and in position 2.  \n    - N is in the secret word but not in position 4.  \n    - C, A, and E are not in the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""grown""** → Feedback: G(not in word), R(correct position), O(correct position), W(correct position), N(correct position).  \n  - This tells us:  \n    - R, O, W, and N are all in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively).  \n    - G is not in the secret word.  \n\n### Analysis:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `[1] R O W N`, where `[1]` is an unknown letter.  \n- The first letter must be a valid English letter that forms a 5-letter word.  \n- Excluded letters (from feedback): C, A, E, G (since they were marked as ""not in word"" in previous guesses).  \n- Possible words fitting the pattern and exclusions:  \n  - **BROWN**: B is not excluded.  \n  - **DROWN**: D is not excluded.  \n  - **FROWN**: F is not excluded.  \n- Since the feedback confirms positions 2–5 are R, O, W, N, the secret word must be one of these three options.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- With only the first letter unknown, the most efficient approach is to guess one of the candidate words directly.  \n- ""BROWN"" is a common word and a reasonable choice to test first.  \n- If incorrect, the feedback will confirm or eliminate B, allowing us to deduce the secret word in the next guess (e.g., if B is wrong, it must be DROWN or FROWN).\n\n<guess>brown</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: grown -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓)\nGuess 3: brown -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses.

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(-), E(x)
  - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
  - N is in the secret word but not in position 4.
  - C, A, E are not in the secret word.

Guess 2: ""grown"" -> G(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓)
  - R is confirmed at position 2 (again).
  - O is in the correct position (position 3).
  - W is in the correct position (position 4).
  - N is in the correct position (position 5). This overrides the previous position hint from guess 1 (N was not at position 4, but now we know it's at position 5).
  - G is not in the secret word.

Guess 3: ""brown"" -> B(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓)
  - R, O, W, N are confirmed at positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (same as guess 2).
  - B is not in the secret word.

Now, from guess 2 and guess 3, we see that positions 3, 4, 5 are fixed as O, W, N. Position 2 is fixed as R. The only unknown is position 1.

The secret word has the pattern: _ R O W N 

We know from feedback that:
- The letter at position 1 cannot be C (from guess 1), A (from guess 1), E (from guess 1), G (from guess 2), or B (from guess 3). So excluded letters: C, A, E, G, B.

Possible English words ending in ""ROWN"" are: brown, crown, drown, frown, grown, crown, etc. But:
- ""grown"" was guessed and gave us G as incorrect, and also we know G is not in the word (so position 1 cannot be G).
- ""brown"" was guessed and B is not in the word (so position 1 cannot be B).
- ""crown"" has C which is excluded? From guess 1, C is not in the word. So ""crown"" is impossible because it has C.

Remaining common words:
- ""drown"": D at position 1.
- ""frown"": F at position 1.

Also, less common words? For example, ""prown"" is not a word. ""trown"" is archaic and unlikely.

So the secret word must be either ""drown"" or ""frown"".

We need to make a new guess (this is our fourth guess).

We can either guess ""drown"" or ""frown"" to test one of them.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that includes both D and F to test, but:
- We know the secret word has fixed positions 2-5: R, O, W, N. So we cannot change those in our guess? Actually, we must provide a valid 5-letter word, but we know those positions are fixed. So the guess must have R at position 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5? Otherwise, if we change them, the feedback would tell us.

But we can guess a word that has the same ending and the first letter being either D or F? But that would be ""drown"" or ""frown"". Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests D and F in the first position? But we don't need to test the letters independently because the entire word pattern is fixed except position 1.

So the most efficient way is to guess one of the two candidates.

Let's choose ""drown"".

If we guess ""drown"":
- If correct, we win.
- If not, then the secret word must be ""frown"".

We have only two possibilities, and two guesses left? We are on guess 4 of 6, so we have two more guesses.

So I'll guess ""drown"".

But note: we have not guessed any word that has D or F? So no prior information on D or F.

Therefore, we pick one arbitrarily.

Alternatively, we might consider that in ""crane"", we had no D or F? But since they were not tested, we don't know.

So either is fine.

I think ""drown"" is a common word, so I'll guess that.

We have three guesses of feedback:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
  - C, A, E not in the word (x)  
  - R fixed at position 2 (✓)  
  - N in the word but not at position 4 (-)  

- **Guess 2 (""grown"")**:  
  - G not in the word (x)  
  - R, O, W, N all correct: positions 2, 3, 4, 5 fixed (R at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5)  

- **Guess 3 (""brown"")**:  
  - B not in the word (x)  
  - Confirmed R/O/W/N positions (same as above)  

### Analysis:  
- The secret word has fixed positions 2–5: **R** (position 2), **O** (position 3), **W** (position 4), **N** (position 5).  
- Position 1 is unknown.  
- Excluded letters (from ""x"" feedback): **C, A, E, G, B**.  
- This means position 1 cannot be C, A, E, G, or B.  
- Possible words: Only valid 5-letter words fitting `_ROWN` and respecting exclusions:  
  - **drown** (position 1: D)  
  - **frown** (position 1: F)  

### Strategy for Guess 4:  
- Since there are only two candidates left, we guess **""drown""** to test position 1 being D.  
- If correct, the puzzle is solved.  
- If incorrect, we deduce the word is **""frown""** and use the next guess.  

<guess>drown</guess>",drown,"We are given feedback for three guesses.

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(-), E(x)
  - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
  - N is in the secret word but not in position 4.
  - C, A, E are not in the secret word.

Guess 2: ""grown"" -> G(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓)
  - R is confirmed at position 2 (again).
  - O is in the correct position (position 3).
  - W is in the correct position (position 4).
  - N is in the correct position (position 5). This overrides the previous position hint from guess 1 (N was not at position 4, but now we know it's at position 5).
  - G is not in the secret word.

Guess 3: ""brown"" -> B(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓)
  - R, O, W, N are confirmed at positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (same as guess 2).
  - B is not in the secret word.

Now, from guess 2 and guess 3, we see that positions 3, 4, 5 are fixed as O, W, N. Position 2 is fixed as R. The only unknown is position 1.

The secret word has the pattern: _ R O W N 

We know from feedback that:
- The letter at position 1 cannot be C (from guess 1), A (from guess 1), E (from guess 1), G (from guess 2), or B (from guess 3). So excluded letters: C, A, E, G, B.

Possible English words ending in ""ROWN"" are: brown, crown, drown, frown, grown, crown, etc. But:
- ""grown"" was guessed and gave us G as incorrect, and also we know G is not in the word (so position 1 cannot be G).
- ""brown"" was guessed and B is not in the word (so position 1 cannot be B).
- ""crown"" has C which is excluded? From guess 1, C is not in the word. So ""crown"" is impossible because it has C.

Remaining common words:
- ""drown"": D at position 1.
- ""frown"": F at position 1.

Also, less common words? For example, ""prown"" is not a word. ""trown"" is archaic and unlikely.

So the secret word must be either ""drown"" or ""frown"".

So the guess must have R at position 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5? Otherwise, if we change them, the feedback would tell us.

But we can guess a word that has the same ending and the first letter being either D or F? But that would be ""drown"" or ""frown"". Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests D and F in the first position? But we don't need to test the letters independently because the entire word pattern is fixed except position 1.

So the most efficient way is to guess one of the two candidates.

Therefore, we pick one arbitrarily.

Alternatively, we might consider that in ""crane"", we had no D or F? But since they were not tested, we don't know.

I think ""drown"" is a common word, so I'll guess that.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"".
 It has C, R, A, N, E — which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x -> not in the secret word
- R: ✓ -> in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2)
- A: x -> not in the secret word
- N: - -> in the word but wrong position
- E: x -> not in the secret word

So, from this:
- The letter R is correct and at position 2 (so the secret word has R as the second letter).
- The letter N is in the secret word but not at position 4 (since in ""crane"" it was at position 4, but it must be in a different position).
- Letters C, A, E are excluded (since they are marked 'x'). So the secret word does not contain C, A, or E.

We need to make a second guess. We must pick a 5-letter word that:
- Has R at position 2 (since it's confirmed).
- Must include the letter N (since N is present) and put it in a position that is not 4. Also, we know N is not in position 4, but it could be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- Must not include C, A, E.

We can also consider other common letters to test.

The word must have the form: _ R _ _ _

We know the secret word has N, but not at position 4. Possible positions for N: 1, 3, or 5.

We should also try to cover other common consonants and vowels (but note that A and E are out, so vowels are limited: O, I, U are possible).

Let me think of words that fit:
- Start with: ? R ? ? ?
- Must contain N (somewhere except position 4) and not contain C, A, E.

Possibilities:
- Try to put N in position 1: ""N R ? ? ?""
- Or position 3: _ R N ? ?
- Or position 5: _ R ? ? N

But note: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong position. So now, we need to avoid position 4 for N.

Also, we can test other common letters to get more information.

A good second guess might be ""ROBIN"", but wait: R is at position 2 (good) and O at 1? Let's check:

ROBIN: 
- Position 1: R? No, R must be at position 2. So ROBIN has R at position 1? Actually, R is at position 1 in ""ROBIN"", but we need R at position 2. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, let's write the positions: 
We need a word with structure: [first] R [third] [fourth] [fifth]

So for ROBIN: 
- R is at position 1 -> not at 2? So ROBIN would be: R at 1, O at 2? Then O is at position 2? But we need R at position 2. So ROBIN doesn't have R at position 2.

We must have the second letter as R.

Another idea: ""TRUNK""?
- T at 1, R at 2 (good), U at 3, N at 4, K at 5.
But in the feedback we know that N is NOT at position 4 (because in first guess it was at position 4 and marked '-', meaning it is in the word but not at that position). So we must not put N at position 4. Therefore, ""TRUNK"" would put N at position 4 again? That's the same position.

So we should avoid putting N at position 4.

What about ""DRINK""?
- D at 1, R at 2 (good), I at 3, N at 4? (but we cannot put N at position 4). So same problem.

We need to put N in a different position: either 1, 3, or 5.

Option 1: N at position 1 -> ""N R ...""
Example: ""NR..."" ... words like ""NRO"" are not words. How about ""NERVY""? But E is excluded, so cannot use E.

Option: N at position 3 -> _ R N _ _
Example words: BURNT? But U and R? Positions: B (1), R (2), N (3) ... then ??. But note: we cannot use A or E. Also, ""burnt"" has U? We can use U.

""Burnt"": B,U,R,N,T -> letters: B, U, R, N, T. R is at 2? Actually: B (1), U (2)? No, ""burnt"" has U at position 2? We need R at position 2. So structure: [1] R [3] [4] [5].

In ""burnt"": 
- B (1), U (2) -> but we need R at (2). So that doesn't work.

What about words with R at 2 and N at 3? For example: ""HORNS""? 
H (1), O (2) -> wait, no: H O R N S? Then R at 3? We need R at 2.

Must have R exactly at position 2.

Another: ""PRINT"": 
P (1), R (2) (good), I (3), N (4)? But we cannot place N at 4? Because it was wrong at 4 previously. So we need to put N at a different position.

But in the feedback of first guess, N was at position 4 and marked '-', meaning N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, for our second guess, putting N at position 4 again would be unwise because we know it's not there. So we must put N at one of the other positions: 1, 3, or 5.

Let me try to find words that have R at 2, N in the word but at position 1, 3, or 5, and without C, A, E.

Possible words:
- N at 1: ""N R ..."", e.g., ""NRO.."" not common. Maybe ""NURSE""? But has E? Excluded. ""NURSY"" is not a word. ""NARKS"" has A -> excluded. So difficult.

- N at 3: _ R N _ _
Examples: ""IRONY"" -> I (1), R (2), O (3)? Wait, no: I R O N Y? Then letters: I (1), R (2), O (3), N (4), Y (5). But again, N is at position 4? We don't want that.

Let me write positions clearly: 
Word: [1] R [3] [4] [5]
We want N at position 3: [1] R N [4] [5]

What words have this pattern? Without A, C, E.

Examples: 
- ""HORNS"": H (1), O (2) -> wait, O at 2? No: H O R N S -> R is at 3? Not 2.

We need R at position 2, so the word must be: 
Position 1: any letter
Position 2: R
Position 3: N (if we choose N at 3)
Position 4 and 5: two other letters

So pattern: letter1 + R + N + letter4 + letter5

Example words: 
- ""CRONY"": C at 1? But C is excluded. 
- ""TRONK"": not a word? 
- ""DRONE"": but D (1), R(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> N is at 4? Not 3. And E is excluded.
- ""GRIND"": G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4)? Again position 4 for N -> not allowed.

Position 3: so we need N at 3? Then: [1] R N [4] [5]

What about ""WORN""? Too short. We need 5 letters.

Let me think: is there a word ""BORNS""? Not common. ""BORNS"" not a word. 
""BORNE""? But has E -> excluded.

""STERN"": S(1), T(2)? But R must be at 2? So S T E R N? Then R at 4? Not 2.

Wait, we have to put R at position 2.

Another word: ""PORNS"" -> P(1), O(2)? Then R at 3? Not 2.

What about ""GIRNS""? Not common.

Maybe shift to putting N at position 5? So pattern: [1] R [3] [4] N

Example: ""XXXRN"", e.g., ""HORNS"" again: H(1), O(2) -> R at 3? Not 2. 

To have R at 2: must be letter1 R [3] [4] N (so N at 5)

Words: ""CRWTH""? Not standard. ""GIRTH"": G(1), I(2)? Then R at 3? No.

Example: ""CURNS"" not word. ""TURNS"": T(1), U(2)? Then R at 3? No.

Maybe: ""BYRN"": too short. 

How about ""WORN""? Not 5 letters.

Perhaps we should not force N at a particular position? The feedback doesn't require that we put N in the word again? Actually, we must include N in the word? No, but the feedback says that N is in the secret word, so we need to account for that. But for the second guess, we are not forced to include N? Actually, no rule says we must include known letters? However, it's beneficial to try to locate the position.

But we know N is in the word (somewhere) so we can try a word that has N at a different position to test.

However, we also want as much new information as possible: testing other consonants and vowels.

We can try a word that has R at position 2 (because it's confirmed) and without C,A,E, and containing N at position other than 4? And we can try other common letters.

A better approach: let's list available letters.

Excluded: C, A, E -> so vowels available: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.
Consonants: avoid those.

Now, consider common letters: R is fixed at 2.

Try a word that has R at 2, and includes N at a new position (say position 1 or 3 or 5) and other letters.

Let me try words with N at position 1: 
""nR___""
Examples: ""NURDS"", but has U and D? Also has S? But E not present? But we don't know if S is in. Alternatively, ""NODUS"" -> but O at 2? Then R? No.

Not many words start with ""NR"". 

Try N at position 5: 
""____N"", with R at position 2.

Words ending with N: 
Pattern: [1] R [3] [4] N

Examples: 
- ""GR_ _ N"": GROAN -> has O and A? A excluded. 
- ""BRAWN"" -> has A? Excluded. 
- ""DRAWN"" -> has A? Excluded. 
- ""FRONT"": F(1), R(2), O(3), N(4)? Then T(5) -> but N is at position 4? Again, same position.

Avoid N at 4.

What about ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> A excluded? And A we know is excluded.

Another: ""CROWN"": C(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> pattern: C (excluded? Yes, C is excluded). So invalid.

But excluding C: we cannot use C.

Another: ""PROWN"" not a word. 

""GROWN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> N at 5. Perfect.

And G, O, W are new letters. And they are allowed? G, O, W: none of them are excluded (we excluded C,A,E).

So ""GROWN"": 
- Letters: G, R, O, W, N. 
- Positions: G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). 
- R at 2 (good), N at 5 (which is new position to test, since it wasn't at 4).

Also, we get to test G, O, W.

Therefore, a good candidate? But wait: the secret word might have duplicate letters? Unlikely? And we don't know.

So let me choose ""GROWN"" as the second guess.

Wait another possibility: ""DROWN"" -> D(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). Also all new letters D, O, W, N.

But D is a common consonant? G and D are both fine.

I think either is acceptable.

But note: in the first guess, we had N at 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting N at 5? So it's a new position.

We also test O, W, and either G or D.

Perhaps ""DROWN"" is slightly more common? But both okay.

Or ""BROWN"": B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). Also possible.

But B is also a common letter.

I think ""BROWN"", ""GROWN"", or ""DROWN"" are all reasonable.

Let me choose ""GROWN"" to have G.

So second guess: GROWN

But note: the secret word might have O or W? We don't know.

But we are testing them.

Therefore, I will guess ""grown"".

But wait, what about words with N at position 3? We skipped that. 
Pattern: [1] R N [4] [5]
Example: ""URNED"" -> has E? Excluded. ""TRND_"" ... not really. Hard to find.

Another word: ""TORNS"": T(1), O(2)? Then R at 3? No.

If we put R at 2 and N at 3: [1] R N [4] [5]
""IRNOP"" not real. So ""GROWN"" seems better.

So I go with ""grown"".

<guess>grown</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", which showed:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: correct letter and position (✓ at position 2)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: present but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

Key insights:
- The secret word has R at position 2.
- The secret word includes N but not at position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""crane"" and marked wrong position).
- The letters C, A, and E are excluded.
- Available vowels: O, I, U (and possibly Y).

For the second guess, I chose ""grown"" because:
- It keeps R in position 2 (required).
- It places N at position 5 to test a new position (since position 4 is invalid for N).
- It introduces new common letters (G, O, W) to gather more information.
- It avoids excluded letters (no C, A, E).

<guess>grown</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: grown -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so position 2 is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word, but not at position 4)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from guess 1:
- The secret word has R at position 2.
- The secret word contains N, but not at position 4.
- The letters C, A, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""grown""
- G: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so position 2 is R, which we already knew)
- O: ✓ (correct position, so position 3 is O)
- W: ✓ (correct position, so position 4 is W)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so position 5 is N)

This is a significant update! The feedback for ""grown"" shows that O, W, and N are in the correct positions (3, 4, and 5 respectively). Also, G is not in the word.

So, putting it together:
- Position 2: R (from both guesses)
- Position 3: O (from guess 2)
- Position 4: W (from guess 2)
- Position 5: N (from guess 2)

We also know that position 1 must be a letter that is not C, A, E, or G (from the x's). Also, the secret word must not contain any of the excluded letters.

Now, what about position 1? We don't have any information about it yet, except that it cannot be C, A, E, or G.

Moreover, we know the entire word except the first letter: _ R O W N

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: [letter] R O W N

And the first letter must be a letter that is not excluded and forms a valid English word.

Excluded letters so far: C, A, E, G.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had N in the word (but not at position 4) and now we have it at position 5, which is consistent.

Now, what are the possible words? Let's list common words ending with ""ROWN"":

- Brown: B is not excluded? B is not in the excluded list. So ""BROWN"" is a candidate.
- Crown: But C is excluded, so not possible.
- Drown: D is not excluded? D is not in the excluded list. So ""DROWN"" is a candidate.
- Frown: F is not excluded? F is not excluded. So ""FROWN"" is a candidate.
- Grown: We already guessed it, and it had G which is excluded? In guess 2, G was marked x, so G is not in the word. But ""grown"" is the word we guessed, and we know it's not the secret word because we got feedback and it's not all green? Actually, the feedback for ""grown"" had G as x, so the secret word is not ""grown"". Also, we have three correct: R, O, W, N, but G is wrong. So the secret word must be a different word with the same last four letters? But the last four are R, O, W, N? Actually, positions: 2,3,4,5 are R,O,W,N. So the word is ?ROWN.

Possible first letters: any letter except C, A, E, G, and it must form a valid word.

Common words:
- Brown (B)
- Drown (D)
- Frown (F)
- Prown? Not a word.
- Trown? Not a word.

So the candidates are: BROWN, DROWN, FROWN.

We need to choose one to guess. Since we have three possibilities, we can pick one arbitrarily? But note, we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on guess 3, and we have 6 tries total, so we can try.

But we can also think about which one is more common? Or we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? However, we already have four letters fixed, so we can just guess one of them.

Alternatively, we can use a word that includes the possible first letters? But that might be inefficient.

Since we have three options, and we are at guess 3, we can guess one and see.

But note: we have not tested the letters B, D, F at all. So we don't know if they are in the word? Actually, the secret word has only one unknown letter: the first one. And it must be one of B, D, F? Because the words are BROWN, DROWN, FROWN.

So we can guess one of them.

To be safe, we can choose the most common one: ""brown"" is a very common word.

But let me check: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong? But in the secret word, if it is ""brown"", then N is at position 5? That matches because in ""crane"" we had N at 4 and it was wrong, and in ""brown"" it is at 5.

Similarly for the others.

So I think we can guess ""brown"".

But wait, what if the word is ""drown"" or ""frown""? Then we'll know from the feedback.

Alternatively, we could use a word that tests multiple, but that might not be necessary.

Since we have the pattern, we can just guess one.

I think ""brown"" is a good guess.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. All of BROWN, DROWN, FROWN are valid.

So I'll go with ""brown"".

But let me double-check the feedback: in guess 2, we had ""grown"" and got G(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓). So the secret word must be a word that has R at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5, and the first letter is not G and not any of the excluded.

So yes, it must be one of BROWN, DROWN, FROWN.

Therefore, I'll guess ""brown"" as the third guess.

<guess>brown</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(correct position), A(not in word), N(in word but wrong position), E(not in word).  
  - This tells us:  
    - R is in the secret word and in position 2.  
    - N is in the secret word but not in position 4.  
    - C, A, and E are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: ""grown""** → Feedback: G(not in word), R(correct position), O(correct position), W(correct position), N(correct position).  
  - This tells us:  
    - R, O, W, and N are all in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively).  
    - G is not in the secret word.  

### Analysis:
- The secret word has the pattern: `[1] R O W N`, where `[1]` is an unknown letter.  
- The first letter must be a valid English letter that forms a 5-letter word.  
- Excluded letters (from feedback): C, A, E, G (since they were marked as ""not in word"" in previous guesses).  
- Possible words fitting the pattern and exclusions:  
  - **BROWN**: B is not excluded.  
  - **DROWN**: D is not excluded.  
  - **FROWN**: F is not excluded.  
- Since the feedback confirms positions 2–5 are R, O, W, N, the secret word must be one of these three options.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- With only the first letter unknown, the most efficient approach is to guess one of the candidate words directly.  
- ""BROWN"" is a common word and a reasonable choice to test first.  
- If incorrect, the feedback will confirm or eliminate B, allowing us to deduce the secret word in the next guess (e.g., if B is wrong, it must be DROWN or FROWN).

<guess>brown</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: grown -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓)
Guess 3: brown -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for three guesses.

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(-), E(x)
  - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
  - N is in the secret word but not in position 4.
  - C, A, E are not in the secret word.

Guess 2: ""grown"" -> G(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓)
  - R is confirmed at position 2 (again).
  - O is in the correct position (position 3).
  - W is in the correct position (position 4).
  - N is in the correct position (position 5). This overrides the previous position hint from guess 1 (N was not at position 4, but now we know it's at position 5).
  - G is not in the secret word.

Guess 3: ""brown"" -> B(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓)
  - R, O, W, N are confirmed at positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (same as guess 2).
  - B is not in the secret word.

Now, from guess 2 and guess 3, we see that positions 3, 4, 5 are fixed as O, W, N. Position 2 is fixed as R. The only unknown is position 1.

The secret word has the pattern: _ R O W N 

We know from feedback that:
- The letter at position 1 cannot be C (from guess 1), A (from guess 1), E (from guess 1), G (from guess 2), or B (from guess 3). So excluded letters: C, A, E, G, B.

Possible English words ending in ""ROWN"" are: brown, crown, drown, frown, grown, crown, etc. But:
- ""grown"" was guessed and gave us G as incorrect, and also we know G is not in the word (so position 1 cannot be G).
- ""brown"" was guessed and B is not in the word (so position 1 cannot be B).
- ""crown"" has C which is excluded? From guess 1, C is not in the word. So ""crown"" is impossible because it has C.

Remaining common words:
- ""drown"": D at position 1.
- ""frown"": F at position 1.

Also, less common words? For example, ""prown"" is not a word. ""trown"" is archaic and unlikely.

So the secret word must be either ""drown"" or ""frown"".

We need to make a new guess (this is our fourth guess).

We can either guess ""drown"" or ""frown"" to test one of them.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that includes both D and F to test, but:
- We know the secret word has fixed positions 2-5: R, O, W, N. So we cannot change those in our guess? Actually, we must provide a valid 5-letter word, but we know those positions are fixed. So the guess must have R at position 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5? Otherwise, if we change them, the feedback would tell us.

But we can guess a word that has the same ending and the first letter being either D or F? But that would be ""drown"" or ""frown"". Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests D and F in the first position? But we don't need to test the letters independently because the entire word pattern is fixed except position 1.

So the most efficient way is to guess one of the two candidates.

Let's choose ""drown"".

If we guess ""drown"":
- If correct, we win.
- If not, then the secret word must be ""frown"".

We have only two possibilities, and two guesses left? We are on guess 4 of 6, so we have two more guesses.

So I'll guess ""drown"".

But note: we have not guessed any word that has D or F? So no prior information on D or F.

Therefore, we pick one arbitrarily.

Alternatively, we might consider that in ""crane"", we had no D or F? But since they were not tested, we don't know.

So either is fine.

I think ""drown"" is a common word, so I'll guess that.

<guess>drown</guess>We have three guesses of feedback:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
  - C, A, E not in the word (x)  
  - R fixed at position 2 (✓)  
  - N in the word but not at position 4 (-)  

- **Guess 2 (""grown"")**:  
  - G not in the word (x)  
  - R, O, W, N all correct: positions 2, 3, 4, 5 fixed (R at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5)  

- **Guess 3 (""brown"")**:  
  - B not in the word (x)  
  - Confirmed R/O/W/N positions (same as above)  

### Analysis:  
- The secret word has fixed positions 2–5: **R** (position 2), **O** (position 3), **W** (position 4), **N** (position 5).  
- Position 1 is unknown.  
- Excluded letters (from ""x"" feedback): **C, A, E, G, B**.  
- This means position 1 cannot be C, A, E, G, or B.  
- Possible words: Only valid 5-letter words fitting `_ROWN` and respecting exclusions:  
  - **drown** (position 1: D)  
  - **frown** (position 1: F)  

### Strategy for Guess 4:  
- Since there are only two candidates left, we guess **""drown""** to test position 1 being D.  
- If correct, the puzzle is solved.  
- If incorrect, we deduce the word is **""frown""** and use the next guess.

But note: we cannot use A or E. Also, ""burnt"" has U? We can use U.\n\n""Burnt"": B,U,R,N,T -> letters: B, U, R, N, T. R is at 2? Actually: B (1), U (2)? No, ""burnt"" has U at position 2? We need R at position 2. So structure: [1] R [3] [4] [5].\n\nIn ""burnt"": \n- B (1), U (2) -> but we need R at (2). So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWhat about words with R at 2 and N at 3? For example: ""HORNS""? \nH (1), O (2) -> wait, no: H O R N S? Then R at 3? We need R at 2.\n\nMust have R exactly at position 2.\n\nAnother: ""PRINT"": \nP (1), R (2) (good), I (3), N (4)? But we cannot place N at 4? Because it was wrong at 4 previously. So we need to put N at a different position.\n\nBut in the feedback of first guess, N was at position 4 and marked \'-\', meaning N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, for our second guess, putting N at position 4 again would be unwise because we know it\'s not there. So we must put N at one of the other positions: 1, 3, or 5.\n\nLet me try to find words that have R at 2, N in the word but at position 1, 3, or 5, and without C, A, E.\n\nPossible words:\n- N at 1: ""N R ..."", e.g., ""NRO.."" not common. Maybe ""NURSE""? But has E? Excluded. ""NURSY"" is not a word. ""NARKS"" has A -> excluded. So difficult.\n\n- N at 3: _ R N _ _\nExamples: ""IRONY"" -> I (1), R (2), O (3)? Wait, no: I R O N Y? Then letters: I (1), R (2), O (3), N (4), Y (5). But again, N is at position 4? We don\'t want that.\n\nLet me write positions clearly: \nWord: [1] R [3] [4] [5]\nWe want N at position 3: [1] R N [4] [5]\n\nWhat words have this pattern? Without A, C, E.\n\nExamples: \n- ""HORNS"": H (1), O (2) -> wait, O at 2? No: H O R N S -> R is at 3? Not 2.\n\nWe need R at position 2, so the word must be: \nPosition 1: any letter\nPosition 2: R\nPosition 3: N (if we choose N at 3)\nPosition 4 and 5: two other letters\n\nSo pattern: letter1 + R + N + letter4 + letter5\n\nExample words: \n- ""CRONY"": C at 1? But C is excluded. \n- ""TRONK"": not a word? \n- ""DRONE"": but D (1), R(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> N is at 4? Not 3. And E is excluded.\n- ""GRIND"": G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4)? Again position 4 for N -> not allowed.\n\nPosition 3: so we need N at 3? Then: [1] R N [4] [5]\n\nWhat about ""WORN""? Too short. We need 5 letters.\n\nLet me think: is there a word ""BORNS""? Not common. ""BORNS"" not a word. \n""BORNE""? But has E -> excluded.\n\n""STERN"": S(1), T(2)? But R must be at 2? So S T E R N? Then R at 4? Not 2.\n\nWait, we have to put R at position 2.\n\nAnother word: ""PORNS"" -> P(1), O(2)? Then R at 3? Not 2.\n\nWhat about ""GIRNS""? Not common.\n\nMaybe shift to putting N at position 5? So pattern: [1] R [3] [4] N\n\nExample: ""XXXRN"", e.g., ""HORNS"" again: H(1), O(2) -> R at 3? Not 2. \n\nTo have R at 2: must be letter1 R [3] [4] N (so N at 5)\n\nWords: ""CRWTH""? Not standard. ""GIRTH"": G(1), I(2)? Then R at 3? No.\n\nExample: ""CURNS"" not word. ""TURNS"": T(1), U(2)? Then R at 3? No.\n\nMaybe: ""BYRN"": too short. \n\nHow about ""WORN""? Not 5 letters.\n\nPerhaps we should not force N at a particular position? The feedback doesn\'t require that we put N in the word again? Actually, we must include N in the word? No, but the feedback says that N is in the secret word, so we need to account for that. But for the second guess, we are not forced to include N? Actually, no rule says we must include known letters? However, it\'s beneficial to try to locate the position.\n\nBut we know N is in the word (somewhere) so we can try a word that has N at a different position to test.\n\nHowever, we also want as much new information as possible: testing other consonants and vowels.\n\nWe can try a word that has R at position 2 (because it\'s confirmed) and without C,A,E, and containing N at position other than 4? And we can try other common letters.\n\nA better approach: let\'s list available letters.\n\nExcluded: C, A, E -> so vowels available: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.\nConsonants: avoid those.\n\nNow, consider common letters: R is fixed at 2.\n\nTry a word that has R at 2, and includes N at a new position (say position 1 or 3 or 5) and other letters.\n\nLet me try words with N at position 1: \n""nR___""\nExamples: ""NURDS"", but has U and D? Also has S? But E not present? But we don\'t know if S is in. Alternatively, ""NODUS"" -> but O at 2? Then R? No.\n\nNot many words start with ""NR"". \n\nTry N at position 5: \n""____N"", with R at position 2.\n\nWords ending with N: \nPattern: [1] R [3] [4] N\n\nExamples: \n- ""GR_ _ N"": GROAN -> has O and A? A excluded. \n- ""BRAWN"" -> has A? Excluded. \n- ""DRAWN"" -> has A? Excluded. \n- ""FRONT"": F(1), R(2), O(3), N(4)? Then T(5) -> but N is at position 4? Again, same position.\n\nAvoid N at 4.\n\nWhat about ""URBAN"" -> U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4) -> A excluded? And A we know is excluded.\n\nAnother: ""CROWN"": C(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> pattern: C (excluded? Yes, C is excluded). So invalid.\n\nBut excluding C: we cannot use C.\n\nAnother: ""PROWN"" not a word. \n\n""GROWN"": G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> N at 5. Perfect.\n\nAnd G, O, W are new letters. And they are allowed? G, O, W: none of them are excluded (we excluded C,A,E).\n\nSo ""GROWN"": \n- Letters: G, R, O, W, N. \n- Positions: G(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). \n- R at 2 (good), N at 5 (which is new position to test, since it wasn\'t at 4).\n\nAlso, we get to test G, O, W.\n\nTherefore, a good candidate? But wait: the secret word might have duplicate letters? Unlikely? And we don\'t know.\n\nSo let me choose ""GROWN"" as the second guess.\n\nWait another possibility: ""DROWN"" -> D(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). Also all new letters D, O, W, N.\n\nBut D is a common consonant? G and D are both fine.\n\nI think either is acceptable.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had N at 4 and it was wrong. Now we are putting N at 5? So it\'s a new position.\n\nWe also test O, W, and either G or D.\n\nPerhaps ""DROWN"" is slightly more common? But both okay.\n\nOr ""BROWN"": B(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). Also possible.\n\nBut B is also a common letter.\n\nI think ""BROWN"", ""GROWN"", or ""DROWN"" are all reasonable.\n\nLet me choose ""GROWN"" to have G.\n\nSo second guess: GROWN\n\nBut note: the secret word might have O or W? We don\'t know.\n\nBut we are testing them.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""grown"".\n\nBut wait, what about words with N at position 3? We skipped that. \nPattern: [1] R N [4] [5]\nExample: ""URNED"" -> has E? Excluded. ""TRND_"" ... not really. Hard to find.\n\nAnother word: ""TORNS"": T(1), O(2)? Then R at 3? No.\n\nIf we put R at 2 and N at 3: [1] R N [4] [5]\n""IRNOP"" not real. So ""GROWN"" seems better.\n\nSo I go with ""grown"".\n\n<guess>grown</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", which showed:\n- C: not in the word (x)\n- R: correct letter and position (✓ at position 2)\n- A: not in the word (x)\n- N: present but wrong position (-)\n- E: not in the word (x)\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word has R at position 2.\n- The secret word includes N but not at position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""crane"" and marked wrong position).\n- The letters C, A, and E are excluded.\n- Available vowels: O, I, U (and possibly Y).\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""grown"" because:\n- It keeps R in position 2 (required).\n- It places N at position 5 to test a new position (since position 4 is invalid for N).\n- It introduces new common letters (G, O, W) to gather more information.\n- It avoids excluded letters (no C, A, E).\n\n<guess>grown</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: grown -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, so position 2 is R)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: - (in the word, but not at position 4)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from guess 1:\n- The secret word has R at position 2.\n- The secret word contains N, but not at position 4.\n- The letters C, A, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""grown""\n- G: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, so position 2 is R, which we already knew)\n- O: ✓ (correct position, so position 3 is O)\n- W: ✓ (correct position, so position 4 is W)\n- N: ✓ (correct position, so position 5 is N)\n\nThis is a significant update! The feedback for ""grown"" shows that O, W, and N are in the correct positions (3, 4, and 5 respectively). Also, G is not in the word.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n- Position 2: R (from both guesses)\n- Position 3: O (from guess 2)\n- Position 4: W (from guess 2)\n- Position 5: N (from guess 2)\n\nWe also know that position 1 must be a letter that is not C, A, E, or G (from the x\'s). Also, the secret word must not contain any of the excluded letters.\n\nNow, what about position 1? We don\'t have any information about it yet, except that it cannot be C, A, E, or G.\n\nMoreover, we know the entire word except the first letter: _ R O W N\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that fits: [letter] R O W N\n\nAnd the first letter must be a letter that is not excluded and forms a valid English word.\n\nExcluded letters so far: C, A, E, G.\n\nAlso, note that in the first guess, we had N in the word (but not at position 4) and now we have it at position 5, which is consistent.\n\nNow, what are the possible words? Let\'s list common words ending with ""ROWN"":\n\n- Brown: B is not excluded? B is not in the excluded list. So ""BROWN"" is a candidate.\n- Crown: But C is excluded, so not possible.\n- Drown: D is not excluded? D is not in the excluded list. So ""DROWN"" is a candidate.\n- Frown: F is not excluded? F is not excluded. So ""FROWN"" is a candidate.\n- Grown: We already guessed it, and it had G which is excluded? In guess 2, G was marked x, so G is not in the word. But ""grown"" is the word we guessed, and we know it\'s not the secret word because we got feedback and it\'s not all green? Actually, the feedback for ""grown"" had G as x, so the secret word is not ""grown"". Also, we have three correct: R, O, W, N, but G is wrong. So the secret word must be a different word with the same last four letters? But the last four are R, O, W, N? Actually, positions: 2,3,4,5 are R,O,W,N. So the word is ?ROWN.\n\nPossible first letters: any letter except C, A, E, G, and it must form a valid word.\n\nCommon words:\n- Brown (B)\n- Drown (D)\n- Frown (F)\n- Prown? Not a word.\n- Trown? Not a word.\n\nSo the candidates are: BROWN, DROWN, FROWN.\n\nWe need to choose one to guess. Since we have three possibilities, we can pick one arbitrarily? But note, we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on guess 3, and we have 6 tries total, so we can try.\n\nBut we can also think about which one is more common? Or we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? However, we already have four letters fixed, so we can just guess one of them.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that includes the possible first letters? But that might be inefficient.\n\nSince we have three options, and we are at guess 3, we can guess one and see.\n\nBut note: we have not tested the letters B, D, F at all. So we don\'t know if they are in the word? Actually, the secret word has only one unknown letter: the first one. And it must be one of B, D, F? Because the words are BROWN, DROWN, FROWN.\n\nSo we can guess one of them.\n\nTo be safe, we can choose the most common one: ""brown"" is a very common word.\n\nBut let me check: in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong? But in the secret word, if it is ""brown"", then N is at position 5? That matches because in ""crane"" we had N at 4 and it was wrong, and in ""brown"" it is at 5.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nSo I think we can guess ""brown"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word is ""drown"" or ""frown""? Then we\'ll know from the feedback.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word that tests multiple, but that might not be necessary.\n\nSince we have the pattern, we can just guess one.\n\nI think ""brown"" is a good guess.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. All of BROWN, DROWN, FROWN are valid.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""brown"".\n\nBut let me double-check the feedback: in guess 2, we had ""grown"" and got G(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓). So the secret word must be a word that has R at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5, and the first letter is not G and not any of the excluded.\n\nSo yes, it must be one of BROWN, DROWN, FROWN.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""brown"" as the third guess.\n\n<guess>brown</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(correct position), A(not in word), N(in word but wrong position), E(not in word).  \n  - This tells us:  \n    - R is in the secret word and in position 2.  \n    - N is in the secret word but not in position 4.  \n    - C, A, and E are not in the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""grown""** → Feedback: G(not in word), R(correct position), O(correct position), W(correct position), N(correct position).  \n  - This tells us:  \n    - R, O, W, and N are all in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively).  \n    - G is not in the secret word.  \n\n### Analysis:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `[1] R O W N`, where `[1]` is an unknown letter.  \n- The first letter must be a valid English letter that forms a 5-letter word.  \n- Excluded letters (from feedback): C, A, E, G (since they were marked as ""not in word"" in previous guesses).  \n- Possible words fitting the pattern and exclusions:  \n  - **BROWN**: B is not excluded.  \n  - **DROWN**: D is not excluded.  \n  - **FROWN**: F is not excluded.  \n- Since the feedback confirms positions 2–5 are R, O, W, N, the secret word must be one of these three options.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- With only the first letter unknown, the most efficient approach is to guess one of the candidate words directly.  \n- ""BROWN"" is a common word and a reasonable choice to test first.  \n- If incorrect, the feedback will confirm or eliminate B, allowing us to deduce the secret word in the next guess (e.g., if B is wrong, it must be DROWN or FROWN).\n\n<guess>brown</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: grown -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓)\nGuess 3: brown -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for three guesses.\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(-), E(x)\n  - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).\n  - N is in the secret word but not in position 4.\n  - C, A, E are not in the secret word.\n\nGuess 2: ""grown"" -> G(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓)\n  - R is confirmed at position 2 (again).\n  - O is in the correct position (position 3).\n  - W is in the correct position (position 4).\n  - N is in the correct position (position 5). This overrides the previous position hint from guess 1 (N was not at position 4, but now we know it\'s at position 5).\n  - G is not in the secret word.\n\nGuess 3: ""brown"" -> B(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓)\n  - R, O, W, N are confirmed at positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (same as guess 2).\n  - B is not in the secret word.\n\nNow, from guess 2 and guess 3, we see that positions 3, 4, 5 are fixed as O, W, N. Position 2 is fixed as R. The only unknown is position 1.\n\nThe secret word has the pattern: _ R O W N \n\nWe know from feedback that:\n- The letter at position 1 cannot be C (from guess 1), A (from guess 1), E (from guess 1), G (from guess 2), or B (from guess 3). So excluded letters: C, A, E, G, B.\n\nPossible English words ending in ""ROWN"" are: brown, crown, drown, frown, grown, crown, etc. But:\n- ""grown"" was guessed and gave us G as incorrect, and also we know G is not in the word (so position 1 cannot be G).\n- ""brown"" was guessed and B is not in the word (so position 1 cannot be B).\n- ""crown"" has C which is excluded? From guess 1, C is not in the word. So ""crown"" is impossible because it has C.\n\nRemaining common words:\n- ""drown"": D at position 1.\n- ""frown"": F at position 1.\n\nAlso, less common words? For example, ""prown"" is not a word. ""trown"" is archaic and unlikely.\n\nSo the secret word must be either ""drown"" or ""frown"".\n\nWe need to make a new guess (this is our fourth guess).\n\nWe can either guess ""drown"" or ""frown"" to test one of them.\n\nAlternatively, we could guess a word that includes both D and F to test, but:\n- We know the secret word has fixed positions 2-5: R, O, W, N. So we cannot change those in our guess? Actually, we must provide a valid 5-letter word, but we know those positions are fixed. So the guess must have R at position 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5? Otherwise, if we change them, the feedback would tell us.\n\nBut we can guess a word that has the same ending and the first letter being either D or F? But that would be ""drown"" or ""frown"". Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests D and F in the first position? But we don\'t need to test the letters independently because the entire word pattern is fixed except position 1.\n\nSo the most efficient way is to guess one of the two candidates.\n\nLet\'s choose ""drown"".\n\nIf we guess ""drown"":\n- If correct, we win.\n- If not, then the secret word must be ""frown"".\n\nWe have only two possibilities, and two guesses left? We are on guess 4 of 6, so we have two more guesses.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""drown"".\n\nBut note: we have not guessed any word that has D or F? So no prior information on D or F.\n\nTherefore, we pick one arbitrarily.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider that in ""crane"", we had no D or F? But since they were not tested, we don\'t know.\n\nSo either is fine.\n\nI think ""drown"" is a common word, so I\'ll guess that.\n\n<guess>drown</guess>We have three guesses of feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  \n  - C, A, E not in the word (x)  \n  - R fixed at position 2 (✓)  \n  - N in the word but not at position 4 (-)  \n\n- **Guess 2 (""grown"")**:  \n  - G not in the word (x)  \n  - R, O, W, N all correct: positions 2, 3, 4, 5 fixed (R at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5)  \n\n- **Guess 3 (""brown"")**:  \n  - B not in the word (x)  \n  - Confirmed R/O/W/N positions (same as above)  \n\n### Analysis:  \n- The secret word has fixed positions 2–5: **R** (position 2), **O** (position 3), **W** (position 4), **N** (position 5).  \n- Position 1 is unknown.  \n- Excluded letters (from ""x"" feedback): **C, A, E, G, B**.  \n- This means position 1 cannot be C, A, E, G, or B.  \n- Possible words: Only valid 5-letter words fitting `_ROWN` and respecting exclusions:  \n  - **drown** (position 1: D)  \n  - **frown** (position 1: F)  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:  \n- Since there are only two candidates left, we guess **""drown""** to test position 1 being D.  \n- If correct, the puzzle is solved.  \n- If incorrect, we deduce the word is **""frown""** and use the next guess.\n\n<guess>drown</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: grown -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓)\nGuess 3: brown -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓)\nGuess 4: drown -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(-), E(x)
  - R is in the correct position (position 2).
  - N is in the word but not at position 4.
  - C, A, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""grown"" → G(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓)
  - R, O, W, N are all in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively).
  - G is not in the word.

Guess 3: ""brown"" → B(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓)
  - R, O, W, N are confirmed at positions 2, 3, 4, 5.
  - B is not in the word.

Guess 4: ""drown"" → D(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓)
  - R, O, W, N are confirmed at positions 2, 3, 4, 5.
  - D is not in the word.

The secret word has the pattern: _ R O W N

We know the following:
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: O (fixed)
- Position 4: W (fixed)
- Position 5: N (fixed)

The only unknown is position 1.

From the feedback, we have excluded the following letters for position 1: C, A, E, G, B, D (from the 'x' marks in the first position of the respective guesses: C in ""crane"", G in ""grown"", B in ""brown"", D in ""drown"", and A and E are also excluded but not in position 1 in those guesses, but they are not in the word at all).

Excluded letters (not in the word at all): C, A, E, G, B, D.

We have two common words that fit the pattern: ""drown"" and ""frown"". But we just guessed ""drown"" and D is not in the word, so ""drown"" is incorrect. Therefore, the only remaining common word is ""frown"".

We must check if ""frown"" is valid:
- F is not excluded? We have not tested F before, and it's not in the list of excluded letters.
- The word ""frown"" has F at position 1, R at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position. In ""frown"", N is at position 5, which is consistent.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""frown"".

We can now guess ""frown"" as the fifth guess.

But let's confirm: are there any other possibilities? For example, ""crown"" is excluded because C is not in the word. ""Grown"" we guessed and G is excluded. ""Brown"" we guessed and B is excluded. ""Drown"" we guessed and D is excluded. So only ""frown"" remains.

So the next guess is ""frown"".

2. Position 1 is the **only unknown**.  
3. **Excluded letters** (cannot be in position 1 or the word at all): **C, A, E, G, B, D**.  
4. **Possible candidates** for position 1:  
   - Must form a valid 5-letter word ending in `ROWN`.  
   - Common words: `BROWN` (B excluded), `CROWN` (C excluded), `DROWN` (D excluded), `GROWN` (G excluded), `FROWN` (F is untested).  
   - **Only `FROWN` remains possible** (F is not excluded).  

### Conclusion:
- The secret word must be **FROWN**.  
- **F** is the only viable candidate for position 1, and it has not been tested or excluded.  

<guess>frown</guess>",frown,"We have the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(-), E(x)
  - R is in the correct position (position 2).
  - N is in the word but not at position 4.
  - C, A, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""grown"" → G(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓)
  - R, O, W, N are all in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively).
  - G is not in the word.

Guess 3: ""brown"" → B(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓)
  - R, O, W, N are confirmed at positions 2, 3, 4, 5.
  - B is not in the word.

Guess 4: ""drown"" → D(x), R(✓), O(✓), W(✓), N(✓)
  - R, O, W, N are confirmed at positions 2, 3, 4, 5.
  - D is not in the word.

The secret word has the pattern: _ R O W N

We know the following:
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: O (fixed)
- Position 4: W (fixed)
- Position 5: N (fixed)

The only unknown is position 1.

From the feedback, we have excluded the following letters for position 1: C, A, E, G, B, D (from the 'x' marks in the first position of the respective guesses: C in ""crane"", G in ""grown"", B in ""brown"", D in ""drown"", and A and E are also excluded but not in position 1 in those guesses, but they are not in the word at all).

Excluded letters (not in the word at all): C, A, E, G, B, D.

We have two common words that fit the pattern: ""drown"" and ""frown"". But we just guessed ""drown"" and D is not in the word, so ""drown"" is incorrect. Therefore, the only remaining common word is ""frown"".

We must check if ""frown"" is valid:
- F is not excluded? We have not tested F before, and it's not in the list of excluded letters.
- The word ""frown"" has F at position 1, R at 2, O at 3, W at 4, N at 5.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position. In ""frown"", N is at position 5, which is consistent.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""frown"".

We can now guess ""frown"" as the fifth guess.

But let's confirm: are there any other possibilities? For example, ""crown"" is excluded because C is not in the word. ""Grown"" we guessed and G is excluded. ""Brown"" we guessed and B is excluded. ""Drown"" we guessed and D is excluded. So only ""frown"" remains.

So the next guess is ""frown"".
