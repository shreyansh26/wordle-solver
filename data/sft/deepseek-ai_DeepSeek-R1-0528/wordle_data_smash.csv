We are making the first guess. There is no previous feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has a mix of common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 We also want to avoid repeating letters to maximize the information gained.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 Some popular starting words include: SOARE, CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, CRATE, SALET, ROATE, RAISE, etc.

 I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains common vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S). 
 R, A, I, S, E are all among the most common letters.

 Let's go with ""RAISE"".

I need to make the first guess for a 5-letter word. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically:
- Uses common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
- Avoids repeated letters
- Covers frequent letters in English words

Letters like E, A, R, S, T are statistically common in English. A balanced word like ""RAISE"" fits well:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- Covers common letters (R ranks 6th, A 2nd, I 8th, S 3rd, E 1st in frequency)
- No repeated letters

Other strong starters (like CRANE or SLATE) are similar, but RAISE has slightly higher vowel coverage. This initial guess will help identify presence/absence of crucial letters quickly.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback:
1. S is in the word and it's in the correct position (since it's the fourth letter, we know the fourth letter of the secret word is S).
2. A is in the word but not in the second position (since it was the second letter in our guess).
3. R, I, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we can summarize:
- Known correct position: fourth letter is S.
- Letters that must be included: A (somewhere else, not at position 2).
- Letters that are ruled out: R, I, E.

We also know that the word does not contain R, I, or E.

Now, since S is in the fourth position, let's denote the word as _ _ _ S _, where the fourth character is S.

We also know that A is somewhere in the word, but not at position 2. So A could be at position 1, 3, or 5. But note, we don't know the rest.

We must avoid the letters R, I, E.

Given this, we want to make a second guess that:
- Has S in the fourth position.
- Includes the letter A in a position that is not second (so positions 1, 3, or 5).
- Uses other common letters that are not ruled out (so avoid R, I, E).

Common letters besides the ruled out ones: T, N, O, U, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We should also try to cover multiple possibilities.

Considering the structure: _ _ _ S _

We need to place A somewhere (not position 2) and avoid R, I, E.

Possible positions for A:
- Position 1: A _ _ S _
- Position 3: _ _ A S _
- Position 5: _ _ _ S A

We should choose a word that tests one of these and introduces new common letters.

Let me think of words that fit:
- If we put A, then in the fourth position is S and we avoid R,I,E.

Also, note that we have three unknown positions, and we know A is present but position unknown.

One approach is to try a word that has A in position 1, which would be A _ _ S _
But we also need to use new letters to get more information.

Alternatively, we can put A in a different position to test it.

Since A cannot be in position 2, we might choose position 1 or 3 or 5. Let's look for words that have S at the end and contain A.

Common words with S at the fourth position (so ending with ??S? but the fifth letter is also present).

Actually, the word is five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with position 4=S.

The fourth letter being S: so pattern: ???S?

Words like: CLASS, GLASS, BRASS, etc. but note that we must include A and avoid R,I,E.

But we know R is ruled out, so we cannot have R in the word.

So avoid R.

Also, E is ruled out, so words with E are out.

Possible words with pattern ???S? and containing A, and no R, no I, no E.

We can start by thinking of words that end with S? but actually it's ...S? meaning the fourth letter is S and then a fifth letter.

Our guess must include A and have S in the fourth position. Also, avoid letters R, I, E.

Let me brainstorm some words:
- CLASS: contains C,L,A,S,S? Wait, CLASS has two S's? But our guess is five distinct letters? No, words can have repeated letters? Yes, but in WORDLE, words might have repeated letters, but in this case we don't know. However, in the feedback, we didn't have repeated letters here. But CLASS: we have C,L,A,S,S? Actually, CLASS has only 4 distinct letters: C,L,A,S. And S repeated? But position: CLASS? C1, L2, A3, S4, S5? Wait, CLASS is C-L-A-S-S, so fifth letter is S? But it's five letters? Actually, CLASS is 5 letters: positions 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S.

But in our case, position 4 is S, that's fixed. But we can try CLASS? But we need to see if it qualifies.

However, note in feedback we got S with a check, so S is in the word and correct position, but if the word has multiple S, it might be an issue? Actually, the feedback handles multiple letters separately. So we can use words with repeated letters.

But let's see: we have R(x) so R out, I(x) out, E(x) out. So we cannot use R,I,E.

Now, CLASS: positions 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S. It has A at position 3 and two S's.

But we know S is at position 4, which is correct, so if we use CLASS, position 4 is S, so that is good. Position 3 is A, which might be correct or not, but we know A is somewhere so we are testing A at position 3.

Also, it introduces L and C.

But CLASS has S at the end too? So fifth letter S. But we don't know the fifth letter yet.

Another word: PLAYS: P-L-A-Y-S. But A is at position 3, S at 5? But position 4 is Y? That's not S? No, we need position 4 to be S.

We need the fourth letter to be S.

List of words with fourth letter S?
For example:
- BASIS: B-A-S-I-S? But I is ruled out? We cannot use I because I was marked absent.
Basis: B1, A2, S3, I4, S5. But position 4 is I? No, we need position 4 to be S.

Perhaps: THASP? Not a word.

Common words: GLASS, CLASS, BRASS (but B is not ruled out? But BRASS has R? R is ruled out? R is marked absent so we cannot have R).

So BRASS has R, so invalid.

FLASK: F-L-A-S-K: position 4 is S? F1, L2, A3, S4, K5. So A is at position 3.

And F,L,K are new letters.

Similarly, TASKS: T-A-S-K-S? T1,A2,S3,K4,S5? S3 is third? But position 4 is K? Not S.

I need the pattern: fourth letter must be S. So ???S?.

Words: 
- with S at position 4: it's less common in English? Like glasses? But five letters.

Possible options: 
- ANGST: A-N-G-S-T. But position 4 is S? A1,N2,G3,S4,T5. But also, A is at position 1? And we can try this? But ANGST has A at position 1.

Now, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. Position 1 is valid for A.

ANGST does not have R,I,E? Check: no R, no I, no E. Good.

Also: CLASP: C-L-A-S-P, but S at position 4? C1,L2,A3,S4,P5? A at position 3.

GAUSS? Like Gauss? But G-A-U-S-S? Is it common? It's a proper noun, might not be acceptable. Also, repeated S.

But in WORD, it should be a common word.

We need valid English words.

Another: PASS? four letters. Five letters: PILES? But I is out.

Perhaps: OASIS? O-A-S-I-S. Position: O1,A2,S3,I4,S5. Position 4 is I? And S at position 3? Not position 4.

We need position 4 specifically to be S.

So ???S? : five letters with S at the fourth position.

Common ones: CLASS, GLASS, BRASS (but R ruled out), FLASK, TASKS? T-A-S-K-S? Positions: T1,A2,S3,K4,S5? S3 and S5, so position 4 is K? So no.

FLASH? F-L-A-S-H: F1,L2,A3,S4,H5? Yes, S at position 4. And A at position 3.

But H is not ruled out.

Similarly, CLASH: C-L-A-S-H? But A at position 3? And S at 4.

But we have rule out: R,I,E, so Clash is C,L,A,S,H — no problem.

Or SMASH: S-M-A-S-H? But S at position 1 and 4? But we don't know about multiple S.

But in our feedback, we have S only at position 4 marked, so if secret has only one S, that's ok.

But SMASH: S1,M2,A3,S4,H5. We have A at position 3.

Potential words:
- CLASS (A at 3, and S at 4 and 5)
- FLASK (A at 3, S at 4)
- CLASH (A at 3, S at 4)
- GLASS (A at 3, S at 4,5)
- PLASM? Not a word.
- TASKS: not S at 4.

Another: OASIS? O1,A2,S3,I4,S5? Position 4 is I? Not S.

BASIS? B1,A2,S3,I4,S5? Position 4 I? No.

Must have position 4=S.

Other words: GRASS? but R.

CAVAS? Not a word.

DASH? no.

Perhaps: YEADS? No.

FLUBS? No.

Focus on words with A and S at position 4.

Now back to our info: we know A is in word but not at position 2, and we have position 4=S.

In ANGST, A is at position 1: A-N-G-S-T.

We can test A at position 1: if it is correct, we get check, else if A is present but wrong position, then we know it's position 3 or 5.

Similarly, in FLASK, A is at position 3.

But let's choose a word that minimizes unused letters.

We need to test A's position.

Also, introduce new common letters to get more info.

For example, T, O, N, L, C, U, etc.

Since we know S is fixed at position 4, we can ignore that and focus on the other positions.

Our second guess should have S at position 4.

Now, where to put A? We have three choices: position 1, 3, or 5.

Position 2 is excluded.

Let's try to put A at position 1: word pattern A _ _ S _

Then we fill with new letters, avoiding R,I,E.

Example: ANTSY? But ANTSY: A1,N2,T3,S4,Y5? S at position 4? Yes. But ANTSY has N,T,S,Y? S at 4? A1,N2,T3,S4,Y5. Also, no R,I,E.

But we have S fixed at 4, but ANTSY has T at 3 and Y at 5.

But does it test A? A at position 1? Yes.

Another: AGASS? Not a word.

AULAS? Not common.

ANGST: A1,N2,G3,S4,T5. This is a word? Meaning? ANGST is a common English word, meaning anxiety. Yes.

We can use ANGST.

Another: ACHES? But E is ruled out? Cannot, E is out.

So ANGST is acceptable? G is not ruled out.

Similarly, what about words with A at position 3: like CLASH: C1,L2,A3,S4,H5.

Or FLASK: F1,L2,A3,S4,K5.

Or CLASS: C1,L2,A3,S4,S5.

But CLASS has two S's, might give extra info.

Now, words with A at position 5: pattern _ _ _ S A

For example: TULSA? T-U-L-S-A? Positions: T1,U2,L3,S4,A5? So A at position 5.

And U,L,T are new.

But is TULSA a common word? It's a city, might be accepted? But perhaps not considered common.

Other? BASIS? But we have position 4 must be S, but BASIS has S at 3? No.

RUSSA? Not a word.

URSA? Four letters.

QUART? Not.

So words with A at position 5 are rare? Like BURSA? But R out.

ORGAN? O-R-G-A-N? Position 4? G? Not S.

So hard to find common words with A at position 5 and S at position 4.

Therefore, perhaps position 1 or 3 is better.

Now, to decide between ANGST (A at 1) or something like CLASS/FLASK (A at 3).

Given we only have limited guesses, we want to maximize information.

If we choose ANGST with A at position 1:
- If A is correct, we get ✓ at position 1.
- If A is not at 1 but in word, we get - which tells us A must be at position 3 or 5.
- If we don't see A in feedback? But we know A is present from the first guess? Exactly, because first guess had A marked as present. So A must be in the word. Therefore, if ANGST has A at 1 and feedback says A at 1 is x, that contradicts? Wait no: the feedback would return A as - meaning present but wrong position? Since we know it should be in the word.

Because in first guess, A was marked as present (but wrong position). So A is definitely in the word. Therefore, in ANGST:
- If position 1 is ✓ for A, then A is first.
- If position 1 is - for A, then A is at position 3 or 5? But position 1 is wrong position? No: the feedback shows per letter.

If we guess ANGST:
- Position 1: A. If A is not at position 1, but A is in word, then it will be marked as present (-), meaning A is at some other position (3 or 5). 
But the word has positions: we have position 4 is fixed S.

In ANGST, positions: 
1: A -> if correct ✓, else -
2: N -> unknown
3: G -> unknown
4: S -> fixed ✓
5: T -> unknown

So, if A is not at position 1, then it will be marked -, meaning A is at position 3 or 5.

Similarly, we get feedback on N,G,T.

Similarly, if we guess FLASK: positions F1,L2,A3,S4,K5.
We know S4 will be ✓. 
A3: if correct ✓, else -? But A must be in word, so if not at 3, - meaning at 1 or 5? But we don't have position 1,5, etc.

Both are valid.

Given that position 2 is ruled out for A (from first feedback), position1 and position3 are both good candidates.

In terms of letter frequency, after avoiding R,I,E, common letters: T,N,L,O,C,U,D,H,K,M,P.

So using those.

ANGST uses N,G,S,T. S is fixed. So new letters: N,G,T.

FLASK uses F,L,A,S,K. S fixed. New: F,L,K.

CLASS uses C,L,A,S,S. New: C,L.

Which letters give more coverage? 

Perhaps L and T are common? But T in ANGST.

But let's think: if we choose ANGST, we test A at position1 and also introduce N,G,T.

Similarly, FLASK tests A at position3 and introduces F,L,K.

Since K is less common than T or N, ANGST might be better?

CLASS? But CLASS has two S, might not reveal much about the fifth position? Because if the secret word has S at position5, it would show ✓ at position4 and position5? But we don't know if the word has multiple S.

To keep it simple, I choose ANGST.

Because it tests A at a new position (position1) and covers common consonants.

So guess: ANGST

But confirm: ANGST? A-N-G-S-T. Positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:G, 4:S, 5:T.

But in feedback, S is at position4, so that will be ✓.

We hope to see about A.

Let's see: if the secret word is for example FLASH? But FLASH has A at position3? So in ANGST, A is at position1, which for FLASH, A is not at 1, so it would be marked -? Meaning present elsewhere? Which is true, position3.

Then position3:G? For FLASH, position3 is A, so G is incorrect? x.

Also, positions: ANGST vs FLASH: A in FLASH: position3, so in ANGST, A at position1 is wrong position, so -, and S4 ✓, and N2,L are different? FLASH: L at2? N vs L? Not same.

Anyway, ANGST is a valid word.

Perhaps CLOUT? No S.

I think ANGST is acceptable.

Another common word: SLATE? But S is at position1? Slate is S-L-A-T-E. Position4 is T? Not S. And also E is ruled out.

DRAIN? R and I out, also not S at4.

So I think ANGST is fine.

Therefore, second guess: ANGST

But we must write it in the format.

Step by step:

Thought:
- From feedback: S at position4 is correct.
- A present but not position2.
- R, I, E absent.
- Need new guess with S at position4 and A not at position2 (so elsewhere).
- Choose word ANGST to test A at position1, and introduce new letters N,G,T.
- Avoid using R,I,E.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and E are absent from the secret word.
- A is present but not in the second position.
- S is present and in the correct position (fourth letter).

Now:
- The secret word has S at position 4: pattern: _ _ _ S _
- A must be somewhere, but not position 2—so position 1, 3, or 5.
- Avoid R, I, E in the new guess.
- To maximize information, test A at position 1 using a word with common unused letters (like N, G, T).

""ANGST"" fits:
- Position 1: A (tests if A is here or elsewhere)
- Position 2: N (new letter)
- Position 3: G (new letter)
- Position 4: S (confirmed, skip feedback)
- Position 5: T (new letter)
- Uses no R, I, E.

If feedback for A is:
- ✓: A at position 1
- -: A must be at position 3 or 5
- Also, feedback for N, G, T will provide new clues.

Thus, ""ANGST"" is a strategic second guess.

<guess>ANGST</guess>",ANGST,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback:
1. S is in the word and it's in the correct position (since it's the fourth letter, we know the fourth letter of the secret word is S).
2. A is in the word but not in the second position (since it was the second letter in our guess).
3. R, I, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we can summarize:
- Known correct position: fourth letter is S.
- Letters that must be included: A (somewhere else, not at position 2).
- Letters that are ruled out: R, I, E.

We also know that the word does not contain R, I, or E.

Now, since S is in the fourth position, let's denote the word as _ _ _ S _, where the fourth character is S.

We also know that A is somewhere in the word, but not at position 2. So A could be at position 1, 3, or 5. But note, we don't know the rest.

We must avoid the letters R, I, E.

Given this, we want to make a second guess that:
- Has S in the fourth position.
- Includes the letter A in a position that is not second (so positions 1, 3, or 5).
- Uses other common letters that are not ruled out (so avoid R, I, E).

Common letters besides the ruled out ones: T, N, O, U, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We should also try to cover multiple possibilities.

Considering the structure: _ _ _ S _

We need to place A somewhere (not position 2) and avoid R, I, E.

Possible positions for A:
- Position 1: A _ _ S _
- Position 3: _ _ A S _
- Position 5: _ _ _ S A

We should choose a word that tests one of these and introduces new common letters.

Let me think of words that fit:
- If we put A, then in the fourth position is S and we avoid R,I,E.

Also, note that we have three unknown positions, and we know A is present but position unknown.

One approach is to try a word that has A in position 1, which would be A _ _ S _
But we also need to use new letters to get more information.

Alternatively, we can put A in a different position to test it.

Since A cannot be in position 2, we might choose position 1 or 3 or 5. Let's look for words that have S at the end and contain A.

Common words with S at the fourth position (so ending with ??S? but the fifth letter is also present).

Actually, the word is five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with position 4=S.

The fourth letter being S: so pattern: ???S?

Words like: CLASS, GLASS, BRASS, etc. but note that we must include A and avoid R,I,E.

But we know R is ruled out, so we cannot have R in the word.

So avoid R.

Also, E is ruled out, so words with E are out.

Possible words with pattern ???S? and containing A, and no R, no I, no E.

We can start by thinking of words that end with S? but actually it's ...S? meaning the fourth letter is S and then a fifth letter.

Our guess must include A and have S in the fourth position. Also, avoid letters R, I, E.

Let me brainstorm some words:
- CLASS: contains C,L,A,S,S? Wait, CLASS has two S's? But our guess is five distinct letters? No, words can have repeated letters? Yes, but in WORDLE, words might have repeated letters, but in this case we don't know. However, in the feedback, we didn't have repeated letters here. But CLASS: we have C,L,A,S,S? Actually, CLASS has only 4 distinct letters: C,L,A,S. And S repeated? But position: CLASS? C1, L2, A3, S4, S5? Wait, CLASS is C-L-A-S-S, so fifth letter is S? But it's five letters? Actually, CLASS is 5 letters: positions 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S.

But in our case, position 4 is S, that's fixed. But we can try CLASS? But we need to see if it qualifies.

However, note in feedback we got S with a check, so S is in the word and correct position, but if the word has multiple S, it might be an issue? Actually, the feedback handles multiple letters separately. So we can use words with repeated letters.

But let's see: we have R(x) so R out, I(x) out, E(x) out. So we cannot use R,I,E.

Now, CLASS: positions 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S. It has A at position 3 and two S's.

But we know S is at position 4, which is correct, so if we use CLASS, position 4 is S, so that is good. Position 3 is A, which might be correct or not, but we know A is somewhere so we are testing A at position 3.

Also, it introduces L and C.

But CLASS has S at the end too? So fifth letter S. But we don't know the fifth letter yet.

Another word: PLAYS: P-L-A-Y-S. But A is at position 3, S at 5? But position 4 is Y? That's not S? No, we need position 4 to be S.

We need the fourth letter to be S.

List of words with fourth letter S?
For example:
- BASIS: B-A-S-I-S? But I is ruled out? We cannot use I because I was marked absent.
Basis: B1, A2, S3, I4, S5. But position 4 is I? No, we need position 4 to be S.

Perhaps: THASP? Not a word.

Common words: GLASS, CLASS, BRASS (but B is not ruled out? But BRASS has R? R is ruled out? R is marked absent so we cannot have R).

So BRASS has R, so invalid.

FLASK: F-L-A-S-K: position 4 is S? F1, L2, A3, S4, K5. So A is at position 3.

And F,L,K are new letters.

Similarly, TASKS: T-A-S-K-S? T1,A2,S3,K4,S5? S3 is third? But position 4 is K? Not S.

I need the pattern: fourth letter must be S. So ???S?.

Words: 
- with S at position 4: it's less common in English? Like glasses? But five letters.

Possible options: 
- ANGST: A-N-G-S-T. But position 4 is S? A1,N2,G3,S4,T5. But also, A is at position 1? And we can try this? But ANGST has A at position 1.

Now, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. Position 1 is valid for A.

ANGST does not have R,I,E? Check: no R, no I, no E. Good.

Also: CLASP: C-L-A-S-P, but S at position 4? C1,L2,A3,S4,P5? A at position 3.

GAUSS? Like Gauss? But G-A-U-S-S? Is it common? It's a proper noun, might not be acceptable. Also, repeated S.

But in WORD, it should be a common word.

We need valid English words.

Another: PASS? four letters. Five letters: PILES? But I is out.

Perhaps: OASIS? O-A-S-I-S. Position: O1,A2,S3,I4,S5. Position 4 is I? And S at position 3? Not position 4.

We need position 4 specifically to be S.

So ???S? : five letters with S at the fourth position.

Common ones: CLASS, GLASS, BRASS (but R ruled out), FLASK, TASKS? T-A-S-K-S? Positions: T1,A2,S3,K4,S5? S3 and S5, so position 4 is K? So no.

FLASH? F-L-A-S-H: F1,L2,A3,S4,H5? Yes, S at position 4. And A at position 3.

But H is not ruled out.

Similarly, CLASH: C-L-A-S-H? But A at position 3? And S at 4.

But we have rule out: R,I,E, so Clash is C,L,A,S,H — no problem.

Or SMASH: S-M-A-S-H? But S at position 1 and 4? But we don't know about multiple S.

But in our feedback, we have S only at position 4 marked, so if secret has only one S, that's ok.

But SMASH: S1,M2,A3,S4,H5. We have A at position 3.

Potential words:
- CLASS (A at 3, and S at 4 and 5)
- FLASK (A at 3, S at 4)
- CLASH (A at 3, S at 4)
- GLASS (A at 3, S at 4,5)
- PLASM? Not a word.
- TASKS: not S at 4.

Another: OASIS? O1,A2,S3,I4,S5? Position 4 is I? Not S.

BASIS? B1,A2,S3,I4,S5? Position 4 I? No.

Must have position 4=S.

Other words: GRASS? but R.

CAVAS? Not a word.

DASH? no.

Perhaps: YEADS? No.

FLUBS? No.

Focus on words with A and S at position 4.

Now back to our info: we know A is in word but not at position 2, and we have position 4=S.

In ANGST, A is at position 1: A-N-G-S-T.

We can test A at position 1: if it is correct, we get check, else if A is present but wrong position, then we know it's position 3 or 5.

Similarly, in FLASK, A is at position 3.

But let's choose a word that minimizes unused letters.

We need to test A's position.

Also, introduce new common letters to get more info.

For example, T, O, N, L, C, U, etc.

Since we know S is fixed at position 4, we can ignore that and focus on the other positions.

Our second guess should have S at position 4.

Now, where to put A? We have three choices: position 1, 3, or 5.

Position 2 is excluded.

Let's try to put A at position 1: word pattern A _ _ S _

Then we fill with new letters, avoiding R,I,E.

Example: ANTSY? But ANTSY: A1,N2,T3,S4,Y5? S at position 4? Yes. But ANTSY has N,T,S,Y? S at 4? A1,N2,T3,S4,Y5. Also, no R,I,E.

But we have S fixed at 4, but ANTSY has T at 3 and Y at 5.

But does it test A? A at position 1? Yes.

Another: AGASS? Not a word.

AULAS? Not common.

ANGST: A1,N2,G3,S4,T5. This is a word? Meaning? ANGST is a common English word, meaning anxiety. Yes.

We can use ANGST.

Another: ACHES? But E is ruled out? Cannot, E is out.

So ANGST is acceptable? G is not ruled out.

Similarly, what about words with A at position 3: like CLASH: C1,L2,A3,S4,H5.

Or FLASK: F1,L2,A3,S4,K5.

Or CLASS: C1,L2,A3,S4,S5.

But CLASS has two S's, might give extra info.

Now, words with A at position 5: pattern _ _ _ S A

For example: TULSA? T-U-L-S-A? Positions: T1,U2,L3,S4,A5? So A at position 5.

And U,L,T are new.

But is TULSA a common word? It's a city, might be accepted? But perhaps not considered common.

Other? BASIS? But we have position 4 must be S, but BASIS has S at 3? No.

RUSSA? Not a word.

URSA? Four letters.

QUART? Not.

So words with A at position 5 are rare? Like BURSA? But R out.

ORGAN? O-R-G-A-N? Position 4? G? Not S.

So hard to find common words with A at position 5 and S at position 4.

Therefore, perhaps position 1 or 3 is better.

Now, to decide between ANGST (A at 1) or something like CLASS/FLASK (A at 3).

Given we only have limited guesses, we want to maximize information.

If we choose ANGST with A at position 1:
- If A is correct, we get ✓ at position 1.
- If A is not at 1 but in word, we get - which tells us A must be at position 3 or 5.
- If we don't see A in feedback? But we know A is present from the first guess? Exactly, because first guess had A marked as present. So A must be in the word. Therefore, if ANGST has A at 1 and feedback says A at 1 is x, that contradicts? Wait no: the feedback would return A as - meaning present but wrong position? Since we know it should be in the word.

Because in first guess, A was marked as present (but wrong position). So A is definitely in the word. Therefore, in ANGST:
- If position 1 is ✓ for A, then A is first.
- If position 1 is - for A, then A is at position 3 or 5? But position 1 is wrong position? No: the feedback shows per letter.

If we guess ANGST:
- Position 1: A. If A is not at position 1, but A is in word, then it will be marked as present (-), meaning A is at some other position (3 or 5). 
But the word has positions: we have position 4 is fixed S.

In ANGST, positions: 
1: A -> if correct ✓, else -
2: N -> unknown
3: G -> unknown
4: S -> fixed ✓
5: T -> unknown

So, if A is not at position 1, then it will be marked -, meaning A is at position 3 or 5.

Similarly, we get feedback on N,G,T.

Similarly, if we guess FLASK: positions F1,L2,A3,S4,K5.
We know S4 will be ✓. 
A3: if correct ✓, else -? But A must be in word, so if not at 3, - meaning at 1 or 5? But we don't have position 1,5, etc.

Both are valid.

Given that position 2 is ruled out for A (from first feedback), position1 and position3 are both good candidates.

In terms of letter frequency, after avoiding R,I,E, common letters: T,N,L,O,C,U,D,H,K,M,P.

So using those.

ANGST uses N,G,S,T. S is fixed. So new letters: N,G,T.

FLASK uses F,L,A,S,K. S fixed. New: F,L,K.

CLASS uses C,L,A,S,S. New: C,L.

Which letters give more coverage? 

Perhaps L and T are common? But T in ANGST.

But let's think: if we choose ANGST, we test A at position1 and also introduce N,G,T.

Similarly, FLASK tests A at position3 and introduces F,L,K.

Since K is less common than T or N, ANGST might be better?

CLASS? But CLASS has two S, might not reveal much about the fifth position? Because if the secret word has S at position5, it would show ✓ at position4 and position5? But we don't know if the word has multiple S.

To keep it simple, I choose ANGST.

Because it tests A at a new position (position1) and covers common consonants.

So guess: ANGST

But confirm: ANGST? A-N-G-S-T. Positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:G, 4:S, 5:T.

But in feedback, S is at position4, so that will be ✓.

We hope to see about A.

Let's see: if the secret word is for example FLASH? But FLASH has A at position3? So in ANGST, A is at position1, which for FLASH, A is not at 1, so it would be marked -? Meaning present elsewhere? Which is true, position3.

Then position3:G? For FLASH, position3 is A, so G is incorrect? x.

Also, positions: ANGST vs FLASH: A in FLASH: position3, so in ANGST, A at position1 is wrong position, so -, and S4 ✓, and N2,L are different? FLASH: L at2? N vs L? Not same.

Anyway, ANGST is a valid word.

Perhaps CLOUT? No S.

I think ANGST is acceptable.

Another common word: SLATE? But S is at position1? Slate is S-L-A-T-E. Position4 is T? Not S. And also E is ruled out.

DRAIN? R and I out, also not S at4.

So I think ANGST is fine.

Therefore, second guess: ANGST

But we must write it in the format.

Step by step:

Thought:
- From feedback: S at position4 is correct.
- A present but not position2.
- R, I, E absent.
- Need new guess with S at position4 and A not at position2 (so elsewhere).
- Choose word ANGST to test A at position1, and introduce new letters N,G,T.
- Avoid using R,I,E.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and E are absent from the secret word.
- A is present but not in the second position.
- S is present and in the correct position (fourth letter).

Now:
- The secret word has S at position 4: pattern: _ _ _ S _
- A must be somewhere, but not position 2—so position 1, 3, or 5.
- Avoid R, I, E in the new guess.
- To maximize information, test A at position 1 using a word with common unused letters (like N, G, T).

""ANGST"" fits:
- Position 1: A (tests if A is here or elsewhere)
- Position 2: N (new letter)
- Position 3: G (new letter)
- Position 4: S (confirmed, skip feedback)
- Position 5: T (new letter)
- Uses no R, I, E.

If feedback for A is:
- ✓: A at position 1
- -: A must be at position 3 or 5
- Also, feedback for N, G, T will provide new clues.

Thus, ""ANGST"" is a strategic second guess.",Guess 2: ANGST -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(x) G(x) S(✓) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,smash,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There is no previous feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has a mix of common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 We also want to avoid repeating letters to maximize the information gained.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 Some popular starting words include: SOARE, CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, CRATE, SALET, ROATE, RAISE, etc.

 I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains common vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S). 
 R, A, I, S, E are all among the most common letters.

 Let's go with ""RAISE"".<thinking>
I need to make the first guess for a 5-letter word. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically:
- Uses common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
- Avoids repeated letters
- Covers frequent letters in English words

Letters like E, A, R, S, T are statistically common in English. A balanced word like ""RAISE"" fits well:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- Covers common letters (R ranks 6th, A 2nd, I 8th, S 3rd, E 1st in frequency)
- No repeated letters

Other strong starters (like CRANE or SLATE) are similar, but RAISE has slightly higher vowel coverage. This initial guess will help identify presence/absence of crucial letters quickly.
</thinking>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback:
1. S is in the word and it's in the correct position (since it's the fourth letter, we know the fourth letter of the secret word is S).
2. A is in the word but not in the second position (since it was the second letter in our guess).
3. R, I, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we can summarize:
- Known correct position: fourth letter is S.
- Letters that must be included: A (somewhere else, not at position 2).
- Letters that are ruled out: R, I, E.

We also know that the word does not contain R, I, or E.

Now, since S is in the fourth position, let's denote the word as _ _ _ S _, where the fourth character is S.

We also know that A is somewhere in the word, but not at position 2. So A could be at position 1, 3, or 5. But note, we don't know the rest.

We must avoid the letters R, I, E.

Given this, we want to make a second guess that:
- Has S in the fourth position.
- Includes the letter A in a position that is not second (so positions 1, 3, or 5).
- Uses other common letters that are not ruled out (so avoid R, I, E).

Common letters besides the ruled out ones: T, N, O, U, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We should also try to cover multiple possibilities.

Considering the structure: _ _ _ S _

We need to place A somewhere (not position 2) and avoid R, I, E.

Possible positions for A:
- Position 1: A _ _ S _
- Position 3: _ _ A S _
- Position 5: _ _ _ S A

We should choose a word that tests one of these and introduces new common letters.

Let me think of words that fit:
- If we put A, then in the fourth position is S and we avoid R,I,E.

Also, note that we have three unknown positions, and we know A is present but position unknown.

One approach is to try a word that has A in position 1, which would be A _ _ S _
But we also need to use new letters to get more information.

Alternatively, we can put A in a different position to test it.

Since A cannot be in position 2, we might choose position 1 or 3 or 5. Let's look for words that have S at the end and contain A.

Common words with S at the fourth position (so ending with ??S? but the fifth letter is also present).

Actually, the word is five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with position 4=S.

The fourth letter being S: so pattern: ???S?

Words like: CLASS, GLASS, BRASS, etc. but note that we must include A and avoid R,I,E.

But we know R is ruled out, so we cannot have R in the word.

So avoid R.

Also, E is ruled out, so words with E are out.

Possible words with pattern ???S? and containing A, and no R, no I, no E.

We can start by thinking of words that end with S? but actually it's ...S? meaning the fourth letter is S and then a fifth letter.

Our guess must include A and have S in the fourth position. Also, avoid letters R, I, E.

Let me brainstorm some words:
- CLASS: contains C,L,A,S,S? Wait, CLASS has two S's? But our guess is five distinct letters? No, words can have repeated letters? Yes, but in WORDLE, words might have repeated letters, but in this case we don't know. However, in the feedback, we didn't have repeated letters here. But CLASS: we have C,L,A,S,S? Actually, CLASS has only 4 distinct letters: C,L,A,S. And S repeated? But position: CLASS? C1, L2, A3, S4, S5? Wait, CLASS is C-L-A-S-S, so fifth letter is S? But it's five letters? Actually, CLASS is 5 letters: positions 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S.

But in our case, position 4 is S, that's fixed. But we can try CLASS? But we need to see if it qualifies.

However, note in feedback we got S with a check, so S is in the word and correct position, but if the word has multiple S, it might be an issue? Actually, the feedback handles multiple letters separately. So we can use words with repeated letters.

But let's see: we have R(x) so R out, I(x) out, E(x) out. So we cannot use R,I,E.

Now, CLASS: positions 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S. It has A at position 3 and two S's.

But we know S is at position 4, which is correct, so if we use CLASS, position 4 is S, so that is good. Position 3 is A, which might be correct or not, but we know A is somewhere so we are testing A at position 3.

Also, it introduces L and C.

But CLASS has S at the end too? So fifth letter S. But we don't know the fifth letter yet.

Another word: PLAYS: P-L-A-Y-S. But A is at position 3, S at 5? But position 4 is Y? That's not S? No, we need position 4 to be S.

We need the fourth letter to be S.

List of words with fourth letter S?
For example:
- BASIS: B-A-S-I-S? But I is ruled out? We cannot use I because I was marked absent.
Basis: B1, A2, S3, I4, S5. But position 4 is I? No, we need position 4 to be S.

Perhaps: THASP? Not a word.

Common words: GLASS, CLASS, BRASS (but B is not ruled out? But BRASS has R? R is ruled out? R is marked absent so we cannot have R).

So BRASS has R, so invalid.

FLASK: F-L-A-S-K: position 4 is S? F1, L2, A3, S4, K5. So A is at position 3.

And F,L,K are new letters.

Similarly, TASKS: T-A-S-K-S? T1,A2,S3,K4,S5? S3 is third? But position 4 is K? Not S.

I need the pattern: fourth letter must be S. So ???S?.

Words: 
- with S at position 4: it's less common in English? Like glasses? But five letters.

Possible options: 
- ANGST: A-N-G-S-T. But position 4 is S? A1,N2,G3,S4,T5. But also, A is at position 1? And we can try this? But ANGST has A at position 1.

Now, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. Position 1 is valid for A.

ANGST does not have R,I,E? Check: no R, no I, no E. Good.

Also: CLASP: C-L-A-S-P, but S at position 4? C1,L2,A3,S4,P5? A at position 3.

GAUSS? Like Gauss? But G-A-U-S-S? Is it common? It's a proper noun, might not be acceptable. Also, repeated S.

But in WORD, it should be a common word.

We need valid English words.

Another: PASS? four letters. Five letters: PILES? But I is out.

Perhaps: OASIS? O-A-S-I-S. Position: O1,A2,S3,I4,S5. Position 4 is I? And S at position 3? Not position 4.

We need position 4 specifically to be S.

So ???S? : five letters with S at the fourth position.

Common ones: CLASS, GLASS, BRASS (but R ruled out), FLASK, TASKS? T-A-S-K-S? Positions: T1,A2,S3,K4,S5? S3 and S5, so position 4 is K? So no.

FLASH? F-L-A-S-H: F1,L2,A3,S4,H5? Yes, S at position 4. And A at position 3.

But H is not ruled out.

Similarly, CLASH: C-L-A-S-H? But A at position 3? And S at 4.

But we have rule out: R,I,E, so Clash is C,L,A,S,H — no problem.

Or SMASH: S-M-A-S-H? But S at position 1 and 4? But we don't know about multiple S.

But in our feedback, we have S only at position 4 marked, so if secret has only one S, that's ok.

But SMASH: S1,M2,A3,S4,H5. We have A at position 3.

Potential words:
- CLASS (A at 3, and S at 4 and 5)
- FLASK (A at 3, S at 4)
- CLASH (A at 3, S at 4)
- GLASS (A at 3, S at 4,5)
- PLASM? Not a word.
- TASKS: not S at 4.

Another: OASIS? O1,A2,S3,I4,S5? Position 4 is I? Not S.

BASIS? B1,A2,S3,I4,S5? Position 4 I? No.

Must have position 4=S.

Other words: GRASS? but R.

CAVAS? Not a word.

DASH? no.

Perhaps: YEADS? No.

FLUBS? No.

Focus on words with A and S at position 4.

Now back to our info: we know A is in word but not at position 2, and we have position 4=S.

In ANGST, A is at position 1: A-N-G-S-T.

We can test A at position 1: if it is correct, we get check, else if A is present but wrong position, then we know it's position 3 or 5.

Similarly, in FLASK, A is at position 3.

But let's choose a word that minimizes unused letters.

We need to test A's position.

Also, introduce new common letters to get more info.

For example, T, O, N, L, C, U, etc.

Since we know S is fixed at position 4, we can ignore that and focus on the other positions.

Our second guess should have S at position 4.

Now, where to put A? We have three choices: position 1, 3, or 5.

Position 2 is excluded.

Let's try to put A at position 1: word pattern A _ _ S _

Then we fill with new letters, avoiding R,I,E.

Example: ANTSY? But ANTSY: A1,N2,T3,S4,Y5? S at position 4? Yes. But ANTSY has N,T,S,Y? S at 4? A1,N2,T3,S4,Y5. Also, no R,I,E.

But we have S fixed at 4, but ANTSY has T at 3 and Y at 5.

But does it test A? A at position 1? Yes.

Another: AGASS? Not a word.

AULAS? Not common.

ANGST: A1,N2,G3,S4,T5. This is a word? Meaning? ANGST is a common English word, meaning anxiety. Yes.

We can use ANGST.

Another: ACHES? But E is ruled out? Cannot, E is out.

So ANGST is acceptable? G is not ruled out.

Similarly, what about words with A at position 3: like CLASH: C1,L2,A3,S4,H5.

Or FLASK: F1,L2,A3,S4,K5.

Or CLASS: C1,L2,A3,S4,S5.

But CLASS has two S's, might give extra info.

Now, words with A at position 5: pattern _ _ _ S A

For example: TULSA? T-U-L-S-A? Positions: T1,U2,L3,S4,A5? So A at position 5.

And U,L,T are new.

But is TULSA a common word? It's a city, might be accepted? But perhaps not considered common.

Other? BASIS? But we have position 4 must be S, but BASIS has S at 3? No.

RUSSA? Not a word.

URSA? Four letters.

QUART? Not.

So words with A at position 5 are rare? Like BURSA? But R out.

ORGAN? O-R-G-A-N? Position 4? G? Not S.

So hard to find common words with A at position 5 and S at position 4.

Therefore, perhaps position 1 or 3 is better.

Now, to decide between ANGST (A at 1) or something like CLASS/FLASK (A at 3).

Given we only have limited guesses, we want to maximize information.

If we choose ANGST with A at position 1:
- If A is correct, we get ✓ at position 1.
- If A is not at 1 but in word, we get - which tells us A must be at position 3 or 5.
- If we don't see A in feedback? But we know A is present from the first guess? Exactly, because first guess had A marked as present. So A must be in the word. Therefore, if ANGST has A at 1 and feedback says A at 1 is x, that contradicts? Wait no: the feedback would return A as - meaning present but wrong position? Since we know it should be in the word.

Because in first guess, A was marked as present (but wrong position). So A is definitely in the word. Therefore, in ANGST:
- If position 1 is ✓ for A, then A is first.
- If position 1 is - for A, then A is at position 3 or 5? But position 1 is wrong position? No: the feedback shows per letter.

If we guess ANGST:
- Position 1: A. If A is not at position 1, but A is in word, then it will be marked as present (-), meaning A is at some other position (3 or 5). 
But the word has positions: we have position 4 is fixed S.

In ANGST, positions: 
1: A -> if correct ✓, else -
2: N -> unknown
3: G -> unknown
4: S -> fixed ✓
5: T -> unknown

So, if A is not at position 1, then it will be marked -, meaning A is at position 3 or 5.

Similarly, we get feedback on N,G,T.

Similarly, if we guess FLASK: positions F1,L2,A3,S4,K5.
We know S4 will be ✓. 
A3: if correct ✓, else -? But A must be in word, so if not at 3, - meaning at 1 or 5? But we don't have position 1,5, etc.

Both are valid.

Given that position 2 is ruled out for A (from first feedback), position1 and position3 are both good candidates.

In terms of letter frequency, after avoiding R,I,E, common letters: T,N,L,O,C,U,D,H,K,M,P.

So using those.

ANGST uses N,G,S,T. S is fixed. So new letters: N,G,T.

FLASK uses F,L,A,S,K. S fixed. New: F,L,K.

CLASS uses C,L,A,S,S. New: C,L.

Which letters give more coverage? 

Perhaps L and T are common? But T in ANGST.

But let's think: if we choose ANGST, we test A at position1 and also introduce N,G,T.

Similarly, FLASK tests A at position3 and introduces F,L,K.

Since K is less common than T or N, ANGST might be better?

CLASS? But CLASS has two S, might not reveal much about the fifth position? Because if the secret word has S at position5, it would show ✓ at position4 and position5? But we don't know if the word has multiple S.

To keep it simple, I choose ANGST.

Because it tests A at a new position (position1) and covers common consonants.

So guess: ANGST

But confirm: ANGST? A-N-G-S-T. Positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:G, 4:S, 5:T.

But in feedback, S is at position4, so that will be ✓.

We hope to see about A.

Let's see: if the secret word is for example FLASH? But FLASH has A at position3? So in ANGST, A is at position1, which for FLASH, A is not at 1, so it would be marked -? Meaning present elsewhere? Which is true, position3.

Then position3:G? For FLASH, position3 is A, so G is incorrect? x.

Also, positions: ANGST vs FLASH: A in FLASH: position3, so in ANGST, A at position1 is wrong position, so -, and S4 ✓, and N2,L are different? FLASH: L at2? N vs L? Not same.

Anyway, ANGST is a valid word.

Perhaps CLOUT? No S.

I think ANGST is acceptable.

Another common word: SLATE? But S is at position1? Slate is S-L-A-T-E. Position4 is T? Not S. And also E is ruled out.

DRAIN? R and I out, also not S at4.

So I think ANGST is fine.

Therefore, second guess: ANGST

But we must write it in the format.

Step by step:

Thought:
- From feedback: S at position4 is correct.
- A present but not position2.
- R, I, E absent.
- Need new guess with S at position4 and A not at position2 (so elsewhere).
- Choose word ANGST to test A at position1, and introduce new letters N,G,T.
- Avoid using R,I,E.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and E are absent from the secret word.
- A is present but not in the second position.
- S is present and in the correct position (fourth letter).

Now:
- The secret word has S at position 4: pattern: _ _ _ S _
- A must be somewhere, but not position 2—so position 1, 3, or 5.
- Avoid R, I, E in the new guess.
- To maximize information, test A at position 1 using a word with common unused letters (like N, G, T).

""ANGST"" fits:
- Position 1: A (tests if A is here or elsewhere)
- Position 2: N (new letter)
- Position 3: G (new letter)
- Position 4: S (confirmed, skip feedback)
- Position 5: T (new letter)
- Uses no R, I, E.

If feedback for A is:
- ✓: A at position 1
- -: A must be at position 3 or 5
- Also, feedback for N, G, T will provide new clues.

Thus, ""ANGST"" is a strategic second guess.

S is in the word and it\'s in the correct position (since it\'s the fourth letter, we know the fourth letter of the secret word is S).\n2. A is in the word but not in the second position (since it was the second letter in our guess).\n3. R, I, and E are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, we can summarize:\n- Known correct position: fourth letter is S.\n- Letters that must be included: A (somewhere else, not at position 2).\n- Letters that are ruled out: R, I, E.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain R, I, or E.\n\nNow, since S is in the fourth position, let\'s denote the word as _ _ _ S _, where the fourth character is S.\n\nWe also know that A is somewhere in the word, but not at position 2. So A could be at position 1, 3, or 5.

Let\'s look for words that have S at the end and contain A.\n\nCommon words with S at the fourth position (so ending with ??S? but the fifth letter is also present).\n\nActually, the word is five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with position 4=S.\n\nThe fourth letter being S: so pattern: ???S?\n\nWords like: CLASS, GLASS, BRASS, etc. but note that we must include A and avoid R,I,E.\n\nBut we know R is ruled out, so we cannot have R in the word.\n\nSo avoid R.\n\nAlso, E is ruled out, so words with E are out.\n\nPossible words with pattern ???S? and containing A, and no R, no I, no E.\n\nWe can start by thinking of words that end with S? but actually it\'s ...S? meaning the fourth letter is S and then a fifth letter.\n\nOur guess must include A and have S in the fourth position. Also, avoid letters R, I, E.\n\nLet me brainstorm some words:\n- CLASS: contains C,L,A,S,S? Wait, CLASS has two S\'s? But our guess is five distinct letters? No, words can have repeated letters? Yes, but in WORDLE, words might have repeated letters, but in this case we don\'t know. However, in the feedback, we didn\'t have repeated letters here. But CLASS: we have C,L,A,S,S? Actually, CLASS has only 4 distinct letters: C,L,A,S. And S repeated? But position: CLASS? C1, L2, A3, S4, S5? Wait, CLASS is C-L-A-S-S, so fifth letter is S? But it\'s five letters? Actually, CLASS is 5 letters: positions 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S.\n\nBut in our case, position 4 is S, that\'s fixed. But we can try CLASS? But we need to see if it qualifies.\n\nHowever, note in feedback we got S with a check, so S is in the word and correct position, but if the word has multiple S, it might be an issue? Actually, the feedback handles multiple letters separately. So we can use words with repeated letters.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have R(x) so R out, I(x) out, E(x) out. So we cannot use R,I,E.\n\nNow, CLASS: positions 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S. It has A at position 3 and two S\'s.\n\nBut we know S is at position 4, which is correct, so if we use CLASS, position 4 is S, so that is good. Position 3 is A, which might be correct or not, but we know A is somewhere so we are testing A at position 3.\n\nAlso, it introduces L and C.\n\nBut CLASS has S at the end too? So fifth letter S. But we don\'t know the fifth letter yet.\n\nAnother word: PLAYS: P-L-A-Y-S. But A is at position 3, S at 5? But position 4 is Y? That\'s not S? No, we need position 4 to be S.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S.\n\nList of words with fourth letter S?\nFor example:\n- BASIS: B-A-S-I-S? But I is ruled out? We cannot use I because I was marked absent.\nBasis: B1, A2, S3, I4, S5. But position 4 is I? No, we need position 4 to be S.\n\nPerhaps: THASP? Not a word.\n\nCommon words: GLASS, CLASS, BRASS (but B is not ruled out? But BRASS has R? R is ruled out? R is marked absent so we cannot have R).\n\nSo BRASS has R, so invalid.\n\nFLASK: F-L-A-S-K: position 4 is S? F1, L2, A3, S4, K5. So A is at position 3.\n\nAnd F,L,K are new letters.\n\nSimilarly, TASKS: T-A-S-K-S? T1,A2,S3,K4,S5? S3 is third? But position 4 is K? Not S.\n\nI need the pattern: fourth letter must be S. So ???S?.\n\nWords: \n- with S at position 4: it\'s less common in English? Like glasses? But five letters.\n\nPossible options: \n- ANGST: A-N-G-S-T. But position 4 is S? A1,N2,G3,S4,T5. But also, A is at position 1? And we can try this? But ANGST has A at position 1.\n\nNow, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. Position 1 is valid for A.\n\nANGST does not have R,I,E? Check: no R, no I, no E. Good.\n\nAlso: CLASP: C-L-A-S-P, but S at position 4? C1,L2,A3,S4,P5? A at position 3.\n\nGAUSS? Like Gauss? But G-A-U-S-S? Is it common? It\'s a proper noun, might not be acceptable. Also, repeated S.\n\nBut in WORD, it should be a common word.\n\nWe need valid English words.\n\nAnother: PASS? four letters. Five letters: PILES? But I is out.\n\nPerhaps: OASIS? O-A-S-I-S. Position: O1,A2,S3,I4,S5. Position 4 is I? And S at position 3? Not position 4.\n\nWe need position 4 specifically to be S.\n\nSo ???S? : five letters with S at the fourth position.\n\nCommon ones: CLASS, GLASS, BRASS (but R ruled out), FLASK, TASKS? T-A-S-K-S? Positions: T1,A2,S3,K4,S5? S3 and S5, so position 4 is K? So no.\n\nFLASH? F-L-A-S-H: F1,L2,A3,S4,H5? Yes, S at position 4. And A at position 3.\n\nBut H is not ruled out.\n\nSimilarly, CLASH: C-L-A-S-H? But A at position 3? And S at 4.\n\nBut we have rule out: R,I,E, so Clash is C,L,A,S,H — no problem.\n\nOr SMASH: S-M-A-S-H? But S at position 1 and 4? But we don\'t know about multiple S.\n\nBut in our feedback, we have S only at position 4 marked, so if secret has only one S, that\'s ok.\n\nBut SMASH: S1,M2,A3,S4,H5.

But ANTSY: A1,N2,T3,S4,Y5? S at position 4? Yes. But ANTSY has N,T,S,Y? S at 4? A1,N2,T3,S4,Y5. Also, no R,I,E.\n\nBut we have S fixed at 4, but ANTSY has T at 3 and Y at 5.\n\nBut does it test A?

But we don\'t know if the word has multiple S.\n\nTo keep it simple, I choose ANGST.\n\nBecause it tests A at a new position (position1) and covers common consonants.\n\nSo guess: ANGST\n\nBut confirm: ANGST? A-N-G-S-T. Positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:G, 4:S, 5:T.\n\nBut in feedback, S is at position4, so that will be ✓.\n\nWe hope to see about A.\n\nLet\'s see: if the secret word is for example FLASH? But FLASH has A at position3? So in ANGST, A is at position1, which for FLASH, A is not at 1, so it would be marked -? Meaning present elsewhere? Which is true, position3.\n\nThen position3:G? For FLASH, position3 is A, so G is incorrect? x.\n\nAlso, positions: ANGST vs FLASH: A in FLASH: position3, so in ANGST, A at position1 is wrong position, so -, and S4 ✓, and N2,L are different? FLASH: L at2? N vs L? Not same.\n\nAnyway, ANGST is a valid word.\n\nPerhaps CLOUT? No S.\n\nI think ANGST is acceptable.\n\nAnother common word: SLATE? But S is at position1? Slate is S-L-A-T-E. Position4 is T? Not S. And also E is ruled out.\n\nDRAIN? R and I out, also not S at4.\n\nSo I think ANGST is fine.\n\nTherefore, second guess: ANGST\n\nBut we must write it in the format.\n\nStep by step:\n\nThought:\n- From feedback: S at position4 is correct.\n- A present but not position2.\n- R, I, E absent.\n- Need new guess with S at position4 and A not at position2 (so elsewhere).\n- Choose word ANGST to test A at position1, and introduce new letters N,G,T.\n- Avoid using R,I,E.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, I, and E are absent from the secret word.\n- A is present but not in the second position.\n- S is present and in the correct position (fourth letter).\n\nNow:\n- The secret word has S at position 4: pattern: _ _ _ S _\n- A must be somewhere, but not position 2—so position 1, 3, or 5.\n- Avoid R, I, E in the new guess.\n- To maximize information, test A at position 1 using a word with common unused letters (like N, G, T).\n\n""ANGST"" fits:\n- Position 1: A (tests if A is here or elsewhere)\n- Position 2: N (new letter)\n- Position 3: G (new letter)\n- Position 4: S (confirmed, skip feedback)\n- Position 5: T (new letter)\n- Uses no R, I, E.\n\nIf feedback for A is:\n- ✓: A at position 1\n- -: A must be at position 3 or 5\n- Also, feedback for N, G, T will provide new clues.\n\nThus, ""ANGST"" is a strategic second guess.\n\n<guess>ANGST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: ANGST -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(x) G(x) S(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

**Guess 1: RAISE**
- R(x) : absent
- A(-) : present, wrong position
- I(x) : absent
- S(✓) : correct position
- E(x) : absent

**Guess 2: ANGST**
- A(-) : present, wrong position
- N(x) : absent
- G(x) : absent
- S(✓) : correct position (as before)
- T(x) : absent

**Known so far:**
1. **S is the 4th letter.** (fixed)
2. **A is present but not in position 2 (from RAISE), and not in position 1 (from ANGST feedback).** 
   - Why? In ANGST, A was in position 1 and got a ""-"", meaning it is present but not at position 1. So A must be at position 3 or 5 (since positions 2 and 1 are ruled out).
3. **Absent letters:** R, I, E, N, G, T. So we must avoid these letters: no R, I, E, N, G, T.
4. Also, from ANGST, S is still at position 4 and correct, so that remains.

**Therefore:**
- Secret word pattern: _ _ _ S _
- A must be at position 3 or 5 (since 1 and 2 are ruled out).
- We need to avoid letters R, I, E, N, G, T.

**Possible positions for A:**
- Position 3: so pattern: _ _ A S _
- Position 5: so pattern: _ _ _ S A

**New guess must:**
- Have S at position 4.
- Include A at position 3 or 5 (to confirm which one).
- Use only letters that are not ruled out. Available letters include common consonants/vowels like B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (avoid R,I,E,N,G,T).
- Also, avoid positions: A cannot be at 1 or 2.

To maximize information, we want to test both possibilities:
- If we put A at position 3, we can confirm if it's correct or if position 5 must be considered.
- If we put A at position 5, same idea.

But since we have limited guesses, we should also introduce new common letters to get more clues.

**Option 1: Test A at position 3.**
Pattern: _ _ A S _
We need to fill positions 1,2,5 with new letters (avoiding R,I,E,N,G,T).

Possible words: 
- CLASS: C L A S S? But we used S? Position 4 is S, and if we have another S at 5? Also, CLASS has S at 5? And it uses L and C? But we haven't ruled out L or C.
However, CLASS has 'L' and 'C', but also the fifth letter is S? Let's check: C1, L2, A3, S4, S5.

But note: from RAISE, we have S(✓) for position 4. If CLASS is guessed, S at position 4 will be ✓, S at position 5 might be something: if the secret word has S at position 5, we'll get ✓ at position 5? But if not, we might get - or x? Also, A at position 3: if correct, ✓, else -?

But we know A is present, so it will either be ✓ if at position 3 or - if at position 5? Anyway, we are testing.

But CLASS has S at position 4 and 5. But we are only sure about position 4 so far. 

Other words: FLASH? F L A S H? Positions: F1, L2, A3, S4, H5? Avoids R,I,E,N,G,T? Yes, uses F,L,H.

And F,L,H are new. Not ruled out? So FLASH could be a good guess? 
But we are testing A at position 3.

If we guess FLASH:
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: S (already known)
- Position 5: H

Feedback can tell us about F, L, A, H.

If A is at position 3, we get A as ✓? If not (meaning A is at position 5), we get A as -? Because A is present but not at 3? Then we know A must be at 5? 

Similarly, if we put A at position 5.

But let's also think of words with A at position 5? Pattern: _ _ _ S A
For example: PULSA? Not common word.
Or MANSA? But N is ruled out? N absent.
ORCHS? No.
So fewer common words? Available: words like KELPS? K E L P S? But E is ruled out? E absent? Cannot.
Or BURPS? R and E? Rules out.

So better to test A at position 3? And use words like FLASH.

Other possibilities: CLASH? C L A S H? Similar to FLASH? C-L-A-S-H.

Or PLAST? Not a word? Plastic too long.

So FLASH and CLASH are options? Both have pattern: ? ? A S ?

Now, how to choose? Consider unused letter frequency.

Letters available: among most common: O, L, U, C, D, H, F, M, P, etc.

Both FLASH and CLASH use common letters.

Another word: SMASH? S-M-A-S-H? But S at position 1? Which would be? Position: S1, M2, A3, S4, H5? S at position 1? But we don't know if S is present at position 1? Could be? Also, S at position 4 is known? But if secret word has S at position 1, we might have conflict? But our first guess had R,A,I,S,E: S at position 4 was S? And we didn't have S elsewhere? So no information? 

In FLASH: we have F,L,A,S,H: F,L,H are new and can provide info.

Similarly, CLASH: C,L,A,S,H: C new? L same? H same.

But FLASH: letters F,L,H not used? CLASH uses C,L,H? 

Perhaps FLASH is better? Because F might be less common? Actually, F and H are both in mid-frequency.

To introduce more vowels? But vowels: A is fixed? But we have few vowels left? Possible vowels: O,U,Y? Since A,I,E out? Not I,E are out? I and E absent? But O,U,Y are options? Also A is present? So not included. But we don't have much vowel info? No, we know A is present? But other vowels may exist? Like O,U?

In FLASH, there is no O,U? So we don't test vowels? Similarly CLASH.

Another word: BALSA? B A L S A? Positions: B1,A2,L3,S4,A5? But position 2: A is forbidden? We know A not position 2? So if we guess B1,A2? A2 would be invalid? Position 2: A should not be placed? So BALSA? Position 2: A, which we know is wrong? But the guess is possible? But it might waste a letter? Moreover, BALSA has two A? We don't know if secret has multiple A.

But if we guess BALSA: positions 1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:S, 5:A? Position 2: A? But we know from RAISE that A cannot be at position 2? So if we put A at position 2, it might get an x? Meaning not present? But we know A is present? Contradiction? Actually, no: if we place A at position 2, and secret word has A at position 3 or 5? Then the feedback might be x at position 2? Because it's not position 2? But A is present elsewhere? So it would be marked x for position 2? Meaning that letter is not correct and also not present? But we know A is present? How would feedback show it? Actually, in WORDLE rules: if the letter is in the word but in wrong position, it shows -. If not in word, x? But if we guess A at position 2, and secret has A only at position 3? Then position 2: A would be marked - if that A is meant to be the same? But we have only one A? Actually, the feedback per position? 

In WORDLE: duplicate letters? For example, if secret word has one A, and guess has A at multiple positions: 
- If one is correct position, that gets ✓
- Others: if in secret but wrong position? But since single A? Only one occurrence? So other A may get x? Or only if position?

It's checked per instance? But with single A? Only the A in exact position would be ✓? Others: if wrong position, -? Then when no more occurrence? But same letter: if secret has one A, and you guess two A, one at correct position gets ✓, the other at wrong position? Since A is used up, it might get x? 

Example: secret is FLASH? Position 3:A? If guess is BALSA? Then: position 1:B? Not in FLASH? x? Position 2:A? FLASH position 2 is L? So wrong position? But secret has A at position 3? So A is in the word? Then position 2:A should be marked as present (-) because it is in the word but wrong position? Then position 3:L? In BALSA, L at position 3? FLASH also L? position 3? FLASH: position 3 is A? No: FLASH positions F1,L2,A3,S4,H5? Secret: F-L-A-S-H? Position 2: L? Position 3: A? 

If guess BALSA: B1,A2,L3,S4,A5? Secret FLASH?

Position 1: B vs F? Not match? B not in secret? x
Position 2: A vs L? Wrong? But secret has A? Since A is not at position 2? But A is at position 3? Therefore, position 2 guess A should be marked -? Because A is in secret at another position? Then position 3: L vs A? Secret position 3 is A? Guess is L? L is in secret at position 2? Therefore, L at position 3 secret? Not? Secret position 2 is L? So guess L at position 3? Secret position 2 is L? Wrong position? So L at guess position 3 should be -? Because L is present? Then position 4 S same? ✓ and position 5 A vs H? A present? But secret position 5 H? A not H? So A is in secret at position 3? We have already one A used? So position 5 A? Secret has one A? So might mark x? It's messy.

So better to avoid putting A at position 2? We know it's wrong.

Back to previous: easier words are FLASH, CLASH?

Also, possible: OASIS? But positions: O1,A2,S3,I4,S5? But position 4? We need S at position 4? Position 3 is S? Not position 4? Incorrect pattern.

Must S at position 4.

Another word: MACHO? Not.

So FLASH seems good.

But FLASH: positions F,L,A,S,H? We will put A at position 3? But we are testing that position.

Alternative: if we want to test position 5? Pattern: _ _ _ S A

Words? Like CAMPSA? Not.
ORGAN? Not S? 
ULSA? No.
SOUSA? S-O-U-S-A? Positions: S1,O2,U3,S4,A5? S at position 1 and 4? And O,U? But rule out O? U? Not ruled out? But we have S at position 1? If we guess SOUSA? Secret might or not? But SOUSA has S at position 4? Yes? 
But SOUSA: S-O-U-S-A? Let's see: S1,O2,U3,S4,A5? 
So S at position 4? ✓? A at position 5? To test position 5? And S at position 1? If S at position 1? Or not?

But we also want to test A at position 5?

In SOUSA, we introduce O,U,A? But A is known? And S? So new O and U? And avoid: no R,I,E,N,G,T? SOUSA: S,O,U? O and U new? But we are testing: position 1 S? But we don't know position 1? So S at position 1? Could be correct or wrong? If position 1 S? ✓? Else? Since S present, if wrong position might be -? But position 4 is S? Which is correct? So no issue? But might be marked separately? 

However, SOUSA has duplicate S? It might be acceptable? So:
If we guess SOUSA: 
Position 1 S: could be ✓ if first letter S? Else, if S not at 1? Since we know S at 4, and no information about multiple S, it could be - or x? 
Position 5 A: if A is at position 5? ✓? Else, if A at position 3? Then it would be -? Since A present? Or if not position 5? 

This could work? But SOUSA might not be a common word? Is SOUSA a known English word? Like, Sousa is a surname? And March King? Acceptable? Probably? But in WORDLE, usually common words? Perhaps? But FLASH or CLASH more common.

We'll go with FLASH? Because it tests A at position 3? And if it's correct? We know? If not? Then A must be position 5? And also, we introduce F,L,H? Position 2: L in FLASH? 

So pattern: F L A S H? Then? 

If feedback: 
- A at position 3: ✓? Then we know A at position 3? 
- If A at position 3 is -? Meaning present wrong position? Since we placed it? But we know A is present? If position 3 not correct? Then it must be position 5? And we get - meaning A is elsewhere? 
Then we would know A position? 
Additionally, feedback for F,L,H? 

If all x, then they are absent? Etc.

Moreover, FLASH has five distinct letters? Good.

Now, word validity? Yes, FLASH is a common English word.

So we choose FLASH.

But let's think: from ANGST, we got T absent? So if secret has T? We rule out? We already know T absent? So no issue? 

Similarly, F,L,H can be ruled out if missing?

Therefore, good guess: FLASH

So response: <guess>FLASH</guess>

First, step by step thought process.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1: RAISE**  
     - R(x): Absent → R not in the word.  
     - A(-): Present but wrong position → A in the word, not at position 2.  
     - I(x): Absent → I not in the word.  
     - S(✓): Correct position → S at position 4.  
     - E(x): Absent → E not in the word.  
   - **Guess 2: ANGST**  
     - A(-): Present but wrong position → A in the word, not at position 1 (since ANGST had A at position 1).  
     - N(x): Absent → N not in the word.  
     - G(x): Absent → G not in the word.  
     - S(✓): Correct position → Confirms S at position 4 again.  
     - T(x): Absent → T not in the word.  

2. **Inferences and Constraints:**
   - **Fixed Position:** S is at position 4 → Secret word pattern: `_ _ _ S _`.  
   - **A is Present:** Must be at position 3 or 5 (positions 1 and 2 are eliminated: position 2 from RAISE feedback, position 1 from ANGST feedback).  
   - **Absent Letters:** R, I, E, N, G, T → Cannot use these in new guesses.  
   - **Available Letters:** Focus on common unused letters (e.g., B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y).  
     - Prioritize letters to maximize information if possible (e.g., L, C, H).  

3. **Objective for New Guess:**  
   - Test A's position: Guess should place A at position 3 or 5 to clarify its exact position.  
     - Option: Place A at position 3 to check if it's correct. If not, A must be at position 5.  
   - Include S at position 4.  
   - Introduce new common letters not yet tested to gather more clues (e.g., F, L, H).  
   - Avoid positions 1 and 2 for A.  

4. **Selecting a Valid Word:**  
   - Pattern: `_ _ A S _` or `_ _ _ S A` (since S at position 4 is fixed).  
   - Evaluate options:  
     - `FLASH` (F-L-A-S-H): A at position 3, S at position 4. New letters: F, L, H.  
       - If A is at position 3, it should show ✓.  
       - If A is at position 5, A at position 3 should show - (wrong position), and we’d infer A must be at position 5.  
     - Why FLASH?  
       - Meets all constraints: Uses S at position 4, A not at forbidden positions, avoids absent letters.  
       - Distinct letters: F, L, H are new and common enough to provide useful feedback.  
       - Valid English word (meaning a sudden burst of light or speed).  
     - Alternatives considered:  
       - `CLASH` (C-L-A-S-H) but L is repeated as in FLASH, and C isn't necessarily higher priority.  
       - Words like `CLASS` with S at position 5 were rejected due to potential redundancy (less new information).  

5. **Expected Feedback Benefits:**  
   - Clarifies A’s position (3 vs 5) directly.  
   - Tests F (position 1), L (position 2), and H (position 5) for presence/position, reducing uncertainty for future guesses.  
   - Avoids wasted letters: No guesses from the absent list (R,I,E,N,G,T).

<guess>FLASH</guess>",FLASH,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

**Guess 1: RAISE**
- R(x) : absent
- A(-) : present, wrong position
- I(x) : absent
- S(✓) : correct position
- E(x) : absent

**Guess 2: ANGST**
- A(-) : present, wrong position
- N(x) : absent
- G(x) : absent
- S(✓) : correct position (as before)
- T(x) : absent

**Known so far:**
1. **S is the 4th letter.** (fixed)
2. **A is present but not in position 2 (from RAISE), and not in position 1 (from ANGST feedback).** 
   - Why? In ANGST, A was in position 1 and got a ""-"", meaning it is present but not at position 1. So A must be at position 3 or 5 (since positions 2 and 1 are ruled out).
3. **Absent letters:** R, I, E, N, G, T. So we must avoid these letters: no R, I, E, N, G, T.
4. Also, from ANGST, S is still at position 4 and correct, so that remains.

**Therefore:**
- Secret word pattern: _ _ _ S _
- A must be at position 3 or 5 (since 1 and 2 are ruled out).
- We need to avoid letters R, I, E, N, G, T.

**Possible positions for A:**
- Position 3: so pattern: _ _ A S _
- Position 5: so pattern: _ _ _ S A

**New guess must:**
- Have S at position 4.
- Include A at position 3 or 5 (to confirm which one).
- Use only letters that are not ruled out. Available letters include common consonants/vowels like B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (avoid R,I,E,N,G,T).
- Also, avoid positions: A cannot be at 1 or 2.

To maximize information, we want to test both possibilities:
- If we put A at position 3, we can confirm if it's correct or if position 5 must be considered.
- If we put A at position 5, same idea.

But since we have limited guesses, we should also introduce new common letters to get more clues.

**Option 1: Test A at position 3.**
Pattern: _ _ A S _
We need to fill positions 1,2,5 with new letters (avoiding R,I,E,N,G,T).

Possible words: 
- CLASS: C L A S S? But we used S? Position 4 is S, and if we have another S at 5? Also, CLASS has S at 5? And it uses L and C? But we haven't ruled out L or C.
However, CLASS has 'L' and 'C', but also the fifth letter is S? Let's check: C1, L2, A3, S4, S5.

But note: from RAISE, we have S(✓) for position 4. If CLASS is guessed, S at position 4 will be ✓, S at position 5 might be something: if the secret word has S at position 5, we'll get ✓ at position 5? But if not, we might get - or x? Also, A at position 3: if correct, ✓, else -?

But we know A is present, so it will either be ✓ if at position 3 or - if at position 5? Anyway, we are testing.

But CLASS has S at position 4 and 5. But we are only sure about position 4 so far. 

Other words: FLASH? F L A S H? Positions: F1, L2, A3, S4, H5? Avoids R,I,E,N,G,T? Yes, uses F,L,H.

And F,L,H are new. Not ruled out? So FLASH could be a good guess? 
But we are testing A at position 3.

If we guess FLASH:
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: S (already known)
- Position 5: H

Feedback can tell us about F, L, A, H.

If A is at position 3, we get A as ✓? If not (meaning A is at position 5), we get A as -? Because A is present but not at 3? Then we know A must be at 5? 

Similarly, if we put A at position 5.

But let's also think of words with A at position 5? Pattern: _ _ _ S A
For example: PULSA? Not common word.
Or MANSA? But N is ruled out? N absent.
ORCHS? No.
So fewer common words? Available: words like KELPS? K E L P S? But E is ruled out? E absent? Cannot.
Or BURPS? R and E? Rules out.

So better to test A at position 3? And use words like FLASH.

Other possibilities: CLASH? C L A S H? Similar to FLASH? C-L-A-S-H.

Or PLAST? Not a word? Plastic too long.

So FLASH and CLASH are options? Both have pattern: ? ? A S ?

Now, how to choose? Consider unused letter frequency.

Letters available: among most common: O, L, U, C, D, H, F, M, P, etc.

Both FLASH and CLASH use common letters.

Another word: SMASH? S-M-A-S-H? But S at position 1? Which would be? Position: S1, M2, A3, S4, H5? S at position 1? But we don't know if S is present at position 1? Could be? Also, S at position 4 is known? But if secret word has S at position 1, we might have conflict? But our first guess had R,A,I,S,E: S at position 4 was S? And we didn't have S elsewhere? So no information? 

In FLASH: we have F,L,A,S,H: F,L,H are new and can provide info.

Similarly, CLASH: C,L,A,S,H: C new? L same? H same.

But FLASH: letters F,L,H not used? CLASH uses C,L,H? 

Perhaps FLASH is better? Because F might be less common? Actually, F and H are both in mid-frequency.

To introduce more vowels? But vowels: A is fixed? But we have few vowels left? Possible vowels: O,U,Y? Since A,I,E out? Not I,E are out? I and E absent? But O,U,Y are options? Also A is present? So not included. But we don't have much vowel info? No, we know A is present? But other vowels may exist? Like O,U?

In FLASH, there is no O,U? So we don't test vowels? Similarly CLASH.

Another word: BALSA? B A L S A? Positions: B1,A2,L3,S4,A5? But position 2: A is forbidden? We know A not position 2? So if we guess B1,A2? A2 would be invalid? Position 2: A should not be placed? So BALSA? Position 2: A, which we know is wrong? But the guess is possible? But it might waste a letter? Moreover, BALSA has two A? We don't know if secret has multiple A.

But if we guess BALSA: positions 1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:S, 5:A? Position 2: A? But we know from RAISE that A cannot be at position 2? So if we put A at position 2, it might get an x? Meaning not present? But we know A is present? Contradiction? Actually, no: if we place A at position 2, and secret word has A at position 3 or 5? Then the feedback might be x at position 2? Because it's not position 2? But A is present elsewhere? So it would be marked x for position 2? Meaning that letter is not correct and also not present? But we know A is present? How would feedback show it? Actually, in WORDLE rules: if the letter is in the word but in wrong position, it shows -. If not in word, x? But if we guess A at position 2, and secret has A only at position 3? Then position 2: A would be marked - if that A is meant to be the same? But we have only one A? Actually, the feedback per position? 

In WORDLE: duplicate letters? For example, if secret word has one A, and guess has A at multiple positions: 
- If one is correct position, that gets ✓
- Others: if in secret but wrong position? But since single A? Only one occurrence? So other A may get x? Or only if position?

It's checked per instance? But with single A? Only the A in exact position would be ✓? Others: if wrong position, -? Then when no more occurrence? But same letter: if secret has one A, and you guess two A, one at correct position gets ✓, the other at wrong position? Since A is used up, it might get x? 

Example: secret is FLASH? Position 3:A? If guess is BALSA? Then: position 1:B? Not in FLASH? x? Position 2:A? FLASH position 2 is L? So wrong position? But secret has A at position 3? So A is in the word? Then position 2:A should be marked as present (-) because it is in the word but wrong position? Then position 3:L? In BALSA, L at position 3? FLASH also L? position 3? FLASH: position 3 is A? No: FLASH positions F1,L2,A3,S4,H5? Secret: F-L-A-S-H? Position 2: L? Position 3: A? 

If guess BALSA: B1,A2,L3,S4,A5? Secret FLASH?

Position 1: B vs F? Not match? B not in secret? x
Position 2: A vs L? Wrong? But secret has A? Since A is not at position 2? But A is at position 3? Therefore, position 2 guess A should be marked -? Because A is in secret at another position? Then position 3: L vs A? Secret position 3 is A? Guess is L? L is in secret at position 2? Therefore, L at position 3 secret? Not? Secret position 2 is L? So guess L at position 3? Secret position 2 is L? Wrong position? So L at guess position 3 should be -? Because L is present? Then position 4 S same? ✓ and position 5 A vs H? A present? But secret position 5 H? A not H? So A is in secret at position 3? We have already one A used? So position 5 A? Secret has one A? So might mark x? It's messy.

So better to avoid putting A at position 2? We know it's wrong.

Back to previous: easier words are FLASH, CLASH?

Also, possible: OASIS? But positions: O1,A2,S3,I4,S5? But position 4? We need S at position 4? Position 3 is S? Not position 4? Incorrect pattern.

Must S at position 4.

Another word: MACHO? Not.

So FLASH seems good.

But FLASH: positions F,L,A,S,H? We will put A at position 3? But we are testing that position.

Alternative: if we want to test position 5? Pattern: _ _ _ S A

Words? Like CAMPSA? Not.
ORGAN? Not S? 
ULSA? No.
SOUSA? S-O-U-S-A? Positions: S1,O2,U3,S4,A5? S at position 1 and 4? And O,U? But rule out O? U? Not ruled out? But we have S at position 1? If we guess SOUSA? Secret might or not? But SOUSA has S at position 4? Yes? 
But SOUSA: S-O-U-S-A? Let's see: S1,O2,U3,S4,A5? 
So S at position 4? ✓? A at position 5? To test position 5? And S at position 1? If S at position 1? Or not?

But we also want to test A at position 5?

In SOUSA, we introduce O,U,A? But A is known? And S? So new O and U? And avoid: no R,I,E,N,G,T? SOUSA: S,O,U? O and U new? But we are testing: position 1 S? But we don't know position 1? So S at position 1? Could be correct or wrong? If position 1 S? ✓? Else? Since S present, if wrong position might be -? But position 4 is S? Which is correct? So no issue? But might be marked separately? 

However, SOUSA has duplicate S? It might be acceptable? So:
If we guess SOUSA: 
Position 1 S: could be ✓ if first letter S? Else, if S not at 1? Since we know S at 4, and no information about multiple S, it could be - or x? 
Position 5 A: if A is at position 5? ✓? Else, if A at position 3? Then it would be -? Since A present? Or if not position 5? 

This could work? But SOUSA might not be a common word? Is SOUSA a known English word? Like, Sousa is a surname? And March King? Acceptable? Probably? But in WORDLE, usually common words? Perhaps? But FLASH or CLASH more common.

We'll go with FLASH? Because it tests A at position 3? And if it's correct? We know? If not? Then A must be position 5? And also, we introduce F,L,H? Position 2: L in FLASH? 

So pattern: F L A S H? Then? 

If feedback: 
- A at position 3: ✓? Then we know A at position 3? 
- If A at position 3 is -? Meaning present wrong position? Since we placed it? But we know A is present? If position 3 not correct? Then it must be position 5? And we get - meaning A is elsewhere? 
Then we would know A position? 
Additionally, feedback for F,L,H? 

If all x, then they are absent? Etc.

Moreover, FLASH has five distinct letters? Good.

Now, word validity? Yes, FLASH is a common English word.

So we choose FLASH.

But let's think: from ANGST, we got T absent? So if secret has T? We rule out? We already know T absent? So no issue? 

Similarly, F,L,H can be ruled out if missing?

Therefore, good guess: FLASH

So response: <guess>FLASH</guess>

First, step by step thought process.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1: RAISE**  
     - R(x): Absent → R not in the word.  
     - A(-): Present but wrong position → A in the word, not at position 2.  
     - I(x): Absent → I not in the word.  
     - S(✓): Correct position → S at position 4.  
     - E(x): Absent → E not in the word.  
   - **Guess 2: ANGST**  
     - A(-): Present but wrong position → A in the word, not at position 1 (since ANGST had A at position 1).  
     - N(x): Absent → N not in the word.  
     - G(x): Absent → G not in the word.  
     - S(✓): Correct position → Confirms S at position 4 again.  
     - T(x): Absent → T not in the word.  

2. **Inferences and Constraints:**
   - **Fixed Position:** S is at position 4 → Secret word pattern: `_ _ _ S _`.  
   - **A is Present:** Must be at position 3 or 5 (positions 1 and 2 are eliminated: position 2 from RAISE feedback, position 1 from ANGST feedback).  
   - **Absent Letters:** R, I, E, N, G, T → Cannot use these in new guesses.  
   - **Available Letters:** Focus on common unused letters (e.g., B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y).  
     - Prioritize letters to maximize information if possible (e.g., L, C, H).  

3. **Objective for New Guess:**  
   - Test A's position: Guess should place A at position 3 or 5 to clarify its exact position.  
     - Option: Place A at position 3 to check if it's correct. If not, A must be at position 5.  
   - Include S at position 4.  
   - Introduce new common letters not yet tested to gather more clues (e.g., F, L, H).  
   - Avoid positions 1 and 2 for A.  

4. **Selecting a Valid Word:**  
   - Pattern: `_ _ A S _` or `_ _ _ S A` (since S at position 4 is fixed).  
   - Evaluate options:  
     - `FLASH` (F-L-A-S-H): A at position 3, S at position 4. New letters: F, L, H.  
       - If A is at position 3, it should show ✓.  
       - If A is at position 5, A at position 3 should show - (wrong position), and we’d infer A must be at position 5.  
     - Why FLASH?  
       - Meets all constraints: Uses S at position 4, A not at forbidden positions, avoids absent letters.  
       - Distinct letters: F, L, H are new and common enough to provide useful feedback.  
       - Valid English word (meaning a sudden burst of light or speed).  
     - Alternatives considered:  
       - `CLASH` (C-L-A-S-H) but L is repeated as in FLASH, and C isn't necessarily higher priority.  
       - Words like `CLASS` with S at position 5 were rejected due to potential redundancy (less new information).  

5. **Expected Feedback Benefits:**  
   - Clarifies A’s position (3 vs 5) directly.  
   - Tests F (position 1), L (position 2), and H (position 5) for presence/position, reducing uncertainty for future guesses.  
   - Avoids wasted letters: No guesses from the absent list (R,I,E,N,G,T).",Guess 3: FLASH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There is no previous feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has a mix of common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 We also want to avoid repeating letters to maximize the information gained.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 Some popular starting words include: SOARE, CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, CRATE, SALET, ROATE, RAISE, etc.

 I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains common vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S). 
 R, A, I, S, E are all among the most common letters.

 Let's go with ""RAISE"".<thinking>
I need to make the first guess for a 5-letter word. Since there's no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically:
- Uses common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants
- Avoids repeated letters
- Covers frequent letters in English words

Letters like E, A, R, S, T are statistically common in English. A balanced word like ""RAISE"" fits well:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 consonants (R, S)
- Covers common letters (R ranks 6th, A 2nd, I 8th, S 3rd, E 1st in frequency)
- No repeated letters

Other strong starters (like CRANE or SLATE) are similar, but RAISE has slightly higher vowel coverage. This initial guess will help identify presence/absence of crucial letters quickly.
</thinking>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback:
1. S is in the word and it's in the correct position (since it's the fourth letter, we know the fourth letter of the secret word is S).
2. A is in the word but not in the second position (since it was the second letter in our guess).
3. R, I, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we can summarize:
- Known correct position: fourth letter is S.
- Letters that must be included: A (somewhere else, not at position 2).
- Letters that are ruled out: R, I, E.

We also know that the word does not contain R, I, or E.

Now, since S is in the fourth position, let's denote the word as _ _ _ S _, where the fourth character is S.

We also know that A is somewhere in the word, but not at position 2. So A could be at position 1, 3, or 5. But note, we don't know the rest.

We must avoid the letters R, I, E.

Given this, we want to make a second guess that:
- Has S in the fourth position.
- Includes the letter A in a position that is not second (so positions 1, 3, or 5).
- Uses other common letters that are not ruled out (so avoid R, I, E).

Common letters besides the ruled out ones: T, N, O, U, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

We should also try to cover multiple possibilities.

Considering the structure: _ _ _ S _

We need to place A somewhere (not position 2) and avoid R, I, E.

Possible positions for A:
- Position 1: A _ _ S _
- Position 3: _ _ A S _
- Position 5: _ _ _ S A

We should choose a word that tests one of these and introduces new common letters.

Let me think of words that fit:
- If we put A, then in the fourth position is S and we avoid R,I,E.

Also, note that we have three unknown positions, and we know A is present but position unknown.

One approach is to try a word that has A in position 1, which would be A _ _ S _
But we also need to use new letters to get more information.

Alternatively, we can put A in a different position to test it.

Since A cannot be in position 2, we might choose position 1 or 3 or 5. Let's look for words that have S at the end and contain A.

Common words with S at the fourth position (so ending with ??S? but the fifth letter is also present).

Actually, the word is five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with position 4=S.

The fourth letter being S: so pattern: ???S?

Words like: CLASS, GLASS, BRASS, etc. but note that we must include A and avoid R,I,E.

But we know R is ruled out, so we cannot have R in the word.

So avoid R.

Also, E is ruled out, so words with E are out.

Possible words with pattern ???S? and containing A, and no R, no I, no E.

We can start by thinking of words that end with S? but actually it's ...S? meaning the fourth letter is S and then a fifth letter.

Our guess must include A and have S in the fourth position. Also, avoid letters R, I, E.

Let me brainstorm some words:
- CLASS: contains C,L,A,S,S? Wait, CLASS has two S's? But our guess is five distinct letters? No, words can have repeated letters? Yes, but in WORDLE, words might have repeated letters, but in this case we don't know. However, in the feedback, we didn't have repeated letters here. But CLASS: we have C,L,A,S,S? Actually, CLASS has only 4 distinct letters: C,L,A,S. And S repeated? But position: CLASS? C1, L2, A3, S4, S5? Wait, CLASS is C-L-A-S-S, so fifth letter is S? But it's five letters? Actually, CLASS is 5 letters: positions 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S.

But in our case, position 4 is S, that's fixed. But we can try CLASS? But we need to see if it qualifies.

However, note in feedback we got S with a check, so S is in the word and correct position, but if the word has multiple S, it might be an issue? Actually, the feedback handles multiple letters separately. So we can use words with repeated letters.

But let's see: we have R(x) so R out, I(x) out, E(x) out. So we cannot use R,I,E.

Now, CLASS: positions 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S. It has A at position 3 and two S's.

But we know S is at position 4, which is correct, so if we use CLASS, position 4 is S, so that is good. Position 3 is A, which might be correct or not, but we know A is somewhere so we are testing A at position 3.

Also, it introduces L and C.

But CLASS has S at the end too? So fifth letter S. But we don't know the fifth letter yet.

Another word: PLAYS: P-L-A-Y-S. But A is at position 3, S at 5? But position 4 is Y? That's not S? No, we need position 4 to be S.

We need the fourth letter to be S.

List of words with fourth letter S?
For example:
- BASIS: B-A-S-I-S? But I is ruled out? We cannot use I because I was marked absent.
Basis: B1, A2, S3, I4, S5. But position 4 is I? No, we need position 4 to be S.

Perhaps: THASP? Not a word.

Common words: GLASS, CLASS, BRASS (but B is not ruled out? But BRASS has R? R is ruled out? R is marked absent so we cannot have R).

So BRASS has R, so invalid.

FLASK: F-L-A-S-K: position 4 is S? F1, L2, A3, S4, K5. So A is at position 3.

And F,L,K are new letters.

Similarly, TASKS: T-A-S-K-S? T1,A2,S3,K4,S5? S3 is third? But position 4 is K? Not S.

I need the pattern: fourth letter must be S. So ???S?.

Words: 
- with S at position 4: it's less common in English? Like glasses? But five letters.

Possible options: 
- ANGST: A-N-G-S-T. But position 4 is S? A1,N2,G3,S4,T5. But also, A is at position 1? And we can try this? But ANGST has A at position 1.

Now, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. Position 1 is valid for A.

ANGST does not have R,I,E? Check: no R, no I, no E. Good.

Also: CLASP: C-L-A-S-P, but S at position 4? C1,L2,A3,S4,P5? A at position 3.

GAUSS? Like Gauss? But G-A-U-S-S? Is it common? It's a proper noun, might not be acceptable. Also, repeated S.

But in WORD, it should be a common word.

We need valid English words.

Another: PASS? four letters. Five letters: PILES? But I is out.

Perhaps: OASIS? O-A-S-I-S. Position: O1,A2,S3,I4,S5. Position 4 is I? And S at position 3? Not position 4.

We need position 4 specifically to be S.

So ???S? : five letters with S at the fourth position.

Common ones: CLASS, GLASS, BRASS (but R ruled out), FLASK, TASKS? T-A-S-K-S? Positions: T1,A2,S3,K4,S5? S3 and S5, so position 4 is K? So no.

FLASH? F-L-A-S-H: F1,L2,A3,S4,H5? Yes, S at position 4. And A at position 3.

But H is not ruled out.

Similarly, CLASH: C-L-A-S-H? But A at position 3? And S at 4.

But we have rule out: R,I,E, so Clash is C,L,A,S,H — no problem.

Or SMASH: S-M-A-S-H? But S at position 1 and 4? But we don't know about multiple S.

But in our feedback, we have S only at position 4 marked, so if secret has only one S, that's ok.

But SMASH: S1,M2,A3,S4,H5. We have A at position 3.

Potential words:
- CLASS (A at 3, and S at 4 and 5)
- FLASK (A at 3, S at 4)
- CLASH (A at 3, S at 4)
- GLASS (A at 3, S at 4,5)
- PLASM? Not a word.
- TASKS: not S at 4.

Another: OASIS? O1,A2,S3,I4,S5? Position 4 is I? Not S.

BASIS? B1,A2,S3,I4,S5? Position 4 I? No.

Must have position 4=S.

Other words: GRASS? but R.

CAVAS? Not a word.

DASH? no.

Perhaps: YEADS? No.

FLUBS? No.

Focus on words with A and S at position 4.

Now back to our info: we know A is in word but not at position 2, and we have position 4=S.

In ANGST, A is at position 1: A-N-G-S-T.

We can test A at position 1: if it is correct, we get check, else if A is present but wrong position, then we know it's position 3 or 5.

Similarly, in FLASK, A is at position 3.

But let's choose a word that minimizes unused letters.

We need to test A's position.

Also, introduce new common letters to get more info.

For example, T, O, N, L, C, U, etc.

Since we know S is fixed at position 4, we can ignore that and focus on the other positions.

Our second guess should have S at position 4.

Now, where to put A? We have three choices: position 1, 3, or 5.

Position 2 is excluded.

Let's try to put A at position 1: word pattern A _ _ S _

Then we fill with new letters, avoiding R,I,E.

Example: ANTSY? But ANTSY: A1,N2,T3,S4,Y5? S at position 4? Yes. But ANTSY has N,T,S,Y? S at 4? A1,N2,T3,S4,Y5. Also, no R,I,E.

But we have S fixed at 4, but ANTSY has T at 3 and Y at 5.

But does it test A? A at position 1? Yes.

Another: AGASS? Not a word.

AULAS? Not common.

ANGST: A1,N2,G3,S4,T5. This is a word? Meaning? ANGST is a common English word, meaning anxiety. Yes.

We can use ANGST.

Another: ACHES? But E is ruled out? Cannot, E is out.

So ANGST is acceptable? G is not ruled out.

Similarly, what about words with A at position 3: like CLASH: C1,L2,A3,S4,H5.

Or FLASK: F1,L2,A3,S4,K5.

Or CLASS: C1,L2,A3,S4,S5.

But CLASS has two S's, might give extra info.

Now, words with A at position 5: pattern _ _ _ S A

For example: TULSA? T-U-L-S-A? Positions: T1,U2,L3,S4,A5? So A at position 5.

And U,L,T are new.

But is TULSA a common word? It's a city, might be accepted? But perhaps not considered common.

Other? BASIS? But we have position 4 must be S, but BASIS has S at 3? No.

RUSSA? Not a word.

URSA? Four letters.

QUART? Not.

So words with A at position 5 are rare? Like BURSA? But R out.

ORGAN? O-R-G-A-N? Position 4? G? Not S.

So hard to find common words with A at position 5 and S at position 4.

Therefore, perhaps position 1 or 3 is better.

Now, to decide between ANGST (A at 1) or something like CLASS/FLASK (A at 3).

Given we only have limited guesses, we want to maximize information.

If we choose ANGST with A at position 1:
- If A is correct, we get ✓ at position 1.
- If A is not at 1 but in word, we get - which tells us A must be at position 3 or 5.
- If we don't see A in feedback? But we know A is present from the first guess? Exactly, because first guess had A marked as present. So A must be in the word. Therefore, if ANGST has A at 1 and feedback says A at 1 is x, that contradicts? Wait no: the feedback would return A as - meaning present but wrong position? Since we know it should be in the word.

Because in first guess, A was marked as present (but wrong position). So A is definitely in the word. Therefore, in ANGST:
- If position 1 is ✓ for A, then A is first.
- If position 1 is - for A, then A is at position 3 or 5? But position 1 is wrong position? No: the feedback shows per letter.

If we guess ANGST:
- Position 1: A. If A is not at position 1, but A is in word, then it will be marked as present (-), meaning A is at some other position (3 or 5). 
But the word has positions: we have position 4 is fixed S.

In ANGST, positions: 
1: A -> if correct ✓, else -
2: N -> unknown
3: G -> unknown
4: S -> fixed ✓
5: T -> unknown

So, if A is not at position 1, then it will be marked -, meaning A is at position 3 or 5.

Similarly, we get feedback on N,G,T.

Similarly, if we guess FLASK: positions F1,L2,A3,S4,K5.
We know S4 will be ✓. 
A3: if correct ✓, else -? But A must be in word, so if not at 3, - meaning at 1 or 5? But we don't have position 1,5, etc.

Both are valid.

Given that position 2 is ruled out for A (from first feedback), position1 and position3 are both good candidates.

In terms of letter frequency, after avoiding R,I,E, common letters: T,N,L,O,C,U,D,H,K,M,P.

So using those.

ANGST uses N,G,S,T. S is fixed. So new letters: N,G,T.

FLASK uses F,L,A,S,K. S fixed. New: F,L,K.

CLASS uses C,L,A,S,S. New: C,L.

Which letters give more coverage? 

Perhaps L and T are common? But T in ANGST.

But let's think: if we choose ANGST, we test A at position1 and also introduce N,G,T.

Similarly, FLASK tests A at position3 and introduces F,L,K.

Since K is less common than T or N, ANGST might be better?

CLASS? But CLASS has two S, might not reveal much about the fifth position? Because if the secret word has S at position5, it would show ✓ at position4 and position5? But we don't know if the word has multiple S.

To keep it simple, I choose ANGST.

Because it tests A at a new position (position1) and covers common consonants.

So guess: ANGST

But confirm: ANGST? A-N-G-S-T. Positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:G, 4:S, 5:T.

But in feedback, S is at position4, so that will be ✓.

We hope to see about A.

Let's see: if the secret word is for example FLASH? But FLASH has A at position3? So in ANGST, A is at position1, which for FLASH, A is not at 1, so it would be marked -? Meaning present elsewhere? Which is true, position3.

Then position3:G? For FLASH, position3 is A, so G is incorrect? x.

Also, positions: ANGST vs FLASH: A in FLASH: position3, so in ANGST, A at position1 is wrong position, so -, and S4 ✓, and N2,L are different? FLASH: L at2? N vs L? Not same.

Anyway, ANGST is a valid word.

Perhaps CLOUT? No S.

I think ANGST is acceptable.

Another common word: SLATE? But S is at position1? Slate is S-L-A-T-E. Position4 is T? Not S. And also E is ruled out.

DRAIN? R and I out, also not S at4.

So I think ANGST is fine.

Therefore, second guess: ANGST

But we must write it in the format.

Step by step:

Thought:
- From feedback: S at position4 is correct.
- A present but not position2.
- R, I, E absent.
- Need new guess with S at position4 and A not at position2 (so elsewhere).
- Choose word ANGST to test A at position1, and introduce new letters N,G,T.
- Avoid using R,I,E.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, I, and E are absent from the secret word.
- A is present but not in the second position.
- S is present and in the correct position (fourth letter).

Now:
- The secret word has S at position 4: pattern: _ _ _ S _
- A must be somewhere, but not position 2—so position 1, 3, or 5.
- Avoid R, I, E in the new guess.
- To maximize information, test A at position 1 using a word with common unused letters (like N, G, T).

""ANGST"" fits:
- Position 1: A (tests if A is here or elsewhere)
- Position 2: N (new letter)
- Position 3: G (new letter)
- Position 4: S (confirmed, skip feedback)
- Position 5: T (new letter)
- Uses no R, I, E.

If feedback for A is:
- ✓: A at position 1
- -: A must be at position 3 or 5
- Also, feedback for N, G, T will provide new clues.

Thus, ""ANGST"" is a strategic second guess.

<guess>ANGST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: ANGST -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(x) G(x) S(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

**Guess 1: RAISE**
- R(x) : absent
- A(-) : present, wrong position
- I(x) : absent
- S(✓) : correct position
- E(x) : absent

**Guess 2: ANGST**
- A(-) : present, wrong position
- N(x) : absent
- G(x) : absent
- S(✓) : correct position (as before)
- T(x) : absent

**Known so far:**
1. **S is the 4th letter.** (fixed)
2. **A is present but not in position 2 (from RAISE), and not in position 1 (from ANGST feedback).** 
   - Why? In ANGST, A was in position 1 and got a ""-"", meaning it is present but not at position 1. So A must be at position 3 or 5 (since positions 2 and 1 are ruled out).
3. **Absent letters:** R, I, E, N, G, T. So we must avoid these letters: no R, I, E, N, G, T.
4. Also, from ANGST, S is still at position 4 and correct, so that remains.

**Therefore:**
- Secret word pattern: _ _ _ S _
- A must be at position 3 or 5 (since 1 and 2 are ruled out).
- We need to avoid letters R, I, E, N, G, T.

**Possible positions for A:**
- Position 3: so pattern: _ _ A S _
- Position 5: so pattern: _ _ _ S A

**New guess must:**
- Have S at position 4.
- Include A at position 3 or 5 (to confirm which one).
- Use only letters that are not ruled out. Available letters include common consonants/vowels like B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (avoid R,I,E,N,G,T).
- Also, avoid positions: A cannot be at 1 or 2.

To maximize information, we want to test both possibilities:
- If we put A at position 3, we can confirm if it's correct or if position 5 must be considered.
- If we put A at position 5, same idea.

But since we have limited guesses, we should also introduce new common letters to get more clues.

**Option 1: Test A at position 3.**
Pattern: _ _ A S _
We need to fill positions 1,2,5 with new letters (avoiding R,I,E,N,G,T).

Possible words: 
- CLASS: C L A S S? But we used S? Position 4 is S, and if we have another S at 5? Also, CLASS has S at 5? And it uses L and C? But we haven't ruled out L or C.
However, CLASS has 'L' and 'C', but also the fifth letter is S? Let's check: C1, L2, A3, S4, S5.

But note: from RAISE, we have S(✓) for position 4. If CLASS is guessed, S at position 4 will be ✓, S at position 5 might be something: if the secret word has S at position 5, we'll get ✓ at position 5? But if not, we might get - or x? Also, A at position 3: if correct, ✓, else -?

But we know A is present, so it will either be ✓ if at position 3 or - if at position 5? Anyway, we are testing.

But CLASS has S at position 4 and 5. But we are only sure about position 4 so far. 

Other words: FLASH? F L A S H? Positions: F1, L2, A3, S4, H5? Avoids R,I,E,N,G,T? Yes, uses F,L,H.

And F,L,H are new. Not ruled out? So FLASH could be a good guess? 
But we are testing A at position 3.

If we guess FLASH:
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: S (already known)
- Position 5: H

Feedback can tell us about F, L, A, H.

If A is at position 3, we get A as ✓? If not (meaning A is at position 5), we get A as -? Because A is present but not at 3? Then we know A must be at 5? 

Similarly, if we put A at position 5.

But let's also think of words with A at position 5? Pattern: _ _ _ S A
For example: PULSA? Not common word.
Or MANSA? But N is ruled out? N absent.
ORCHS? No.
So fewer common words? Available: words like KELPS? K E L P S? But E is ruled out? E absent? Cannot.
Or BURPS? R and E? Rules out.

So better to test A at position 3? And use words like FLASH.

Other possibilities: CLASH? C L A S H? Similar to FLASH? C-L-A-S-H.

Or PLAST? Not a word? Plastic too long.

So FLASH and CLASH are options? Both have pattern: ? ? A S ?

Now, how to choose? Consider unused letter frequency.

Letters available: among most common: O, L, U, C, D, H, F, M, P, etc.

Both FLASH and CLASH use common letters.

Another word: SMASH? S-M-A-S-H? But S at position 1? Which would be? Position: S1, M2, A3, S4, H5? S at position 1? But we don't know if S is present at position 1? Could be? Also, S at position 4 is known? But if secret word has S at position 1, we might have conflict? But our first guess had R,A,I,S,E: S at position 4 was S? And we didn't have S elsewhere? So no information? 

In FLASH: we have F,L,A,S,H: F,L,H are new and can provide info.

Similarly, CLASH: C,L,A,S,H: C new? L same? H same.

But FLASH: letters F,L,H not used? CLASH uses C,L,H? 

Perhaps FLASH is better? Because F might be less common? Actually, F and H are both in mid-frequency.

To introduce more vowels? But vowels: A is fixed? But we have few vowels left? Possible vowels: O,U,Y? Since A,I,E out? Not I,E are out? I and E absent? But O,U,Y are options? Also A is present? So not included. But we don't have much vowel info? No, we know A is present? But other vowels may exist? Like O,U?

In FLASH, there is no O,U? So we don't test vowels? Similarly CLASH.

Another word: BALSA? B A L S A? Positions: B1,A2,L3,S4,A5? But position 2: A is forbidden? We know A not position 2? So if we guess B1,A2? A2 would be invalid? Position 2: A should not be placed? So BALSA? Position 2: A, which we know is wrong? But the guess is possible? But it might waste a letter? Moreover, BALSA has two A? We don't know if secret has multiple A.

But if we guess BALSA: positions 1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:S, 5:A? Position 2: A? But we know from RAISE that A cannot be at position 2? So if we put A at position 2, it might get an x? Meaning not present? But we know A is present? Contradiction? Actually, no: if we place A at position 2, and secret word has A at position 3 or 5? Then the feedback might be x at position 2? Because it's not position 2? But A is present elsewhere? So it would be marked x for position 2? Meaning that letter is not correct and also not present? But we know A is present? How would feedback show it? Actually, in WORDLE rules: if the letter is in the word but in wrong position, it shows -. If not in word, x? But if we guess A at position 2, and secret has A only at position 3? Then position 2: A would be marked - if that A is meant to be the same? But we have only one A? Actually, the feedback per position? 

In WORDLE: duplicate letters? For example, if secret word has one A, and guess has A at multiple positions: 
- If one is correct position, that gets ✓
- Others: if in secret but wrong position? But since single A? Only one occurrence? So other A may get x? Or only if position?

It's checked per instance? But with single A? Only the A in exact position would be ✓? Others: if wrong position, -? Then when no more occurrence? But same letter: if secret has one A, and you guess two A, one at correct position gets ✓, the other at wrong position? Since A is used up, it might get x? 

Example: secret is FLASH? Position 3:A? If guess is BALSA? Then: position 1:B? Not in FLASH? x? Position 2:A? FLASH position 2 is L? So wrong position? But secret has A at position 3? So A is in the word? Then position 2:A should be marked as present (-) because it is in the word but wrong position? Then position 3:L? In BALSA, L at position 3? FLASH also L? position 3? FLASH: position 3 is A? No: FLASH positions F1,L2,A3,S4,H5? Secret: F-L-A-S-H? Position 2: L? Position 3: A? 

If guess BALSA: B1,A2,L3,S4,A5? Secret FLASH?

Position 1: B vs F? Not match? B not in secret? x
Position 2: A vs L? Wrong? But secret has A? Since A is not at position 2? But A is at position 3? Therefore, position 2 guess A should be marked -? Because A is in secret at another position? Then position 3: L vs A? Secret position 3 is A? Guess is L? L is in secret at position 2? Therefore, L at position 3 secret? Not? Secret position 2 is L? So guess L at position 3? Secret position 2 is L? Wrong position? So L at guess position 3 should be -? Because L is present? Then position 4 S same? ✓ and position 5 A vs H? A present? But secret position 5 H? A not H? So A is in secret at position 3? We have already one A used? So position 5 A? Secret has one A? So might mark x? It's messy.

So better to avoid putting A at position 2? We know it's wrong.

Back to previous: easier words are FLASH, CLASH?

Also, possible: OASIS? But positions: O1,A2,S3,I4,S5? But position 4? We need S at position 4? Position 3 is S? Not position 4? Incorrect pattern.

Must S at position 4.

Another word: MACHO? Not.

So FLASH seems good.

But FLASH: positions F,L,A,S,H? We will put A at position 3? But we are testing that position.

Alternative: if we want to test position 5? Pattern: _ _ _ S A

Words? Like CAMPSA? Not.
ORGAN? Not S? 
ULSA? No.
SOUSA? S-O-U-S-A? Positions: S1,O2,U3,S4,A5? S at position 1 and 4? And O,U? But rule out O? U? Not ruled out? But we have S at position 1? If we guess SOUSA? Secret might or not? But SOUSA has S at position 4? Yes? 
But SOUSA: S-O-U-S-A? Let's see: S1,O2,U3,S4,A5? 
So S at position 4? ✓? A at position 5? To test position 5? And S at position 1? If S at position 1? Or not?

But we also want to test A at position 5?

In SOUSA, we introduce O,U,A? But A is known? And S? So new O and U? And avoid: no R,I,E,N,G,T? SOUSA: S,O,U? O and U new? But we are testing: position 1 S? But we don't know position 1? So S at position 1? Could be correct or wrong? If position 1 S? ✓? Else? Since S present, if wrong position might be -? But position 4 is S? Which is correct? So no issue? But might be marked separately? 

However, SOUSA has duplicate S? It might be acceptable? So:
If we guess SOUSA: 
Position 1 S: could be ✓ if first letter S? Else, if S not at 1? Since we know S at 4, and no information about multiple S, it could be - or x? 
Position 5 A: if A is at position 5? ✓? Else, if A at position 3? Then it would be -? Since A present? Or if not position 5? 

This could work? But SOUSA might not be a common word? Is SOUSA a known English word? Like, Sousa is a surname? And March King? Acceptable? Probably? But in WORDLE, usually common words? Perhaps? But FLASH or CLASH more common.

We'll go with FLASH? Because it tests A at position 3? And if it's correct? We know? If not? Then A must be position 5? And also, we introduce F,L,H? Position 2: L in FLASH? 

So pattern: F L A S H? Then? 

If feedback: 
- A at position 3: ✓? Then we know A at position 3? 
- If A at position 3 is -? Meaning present wrong position? Since we placed it? But we know A is present? If position 3 not correct? Then it must be position 5? And we get - meaning A is elsewhere? 
Then we would know A position? 
Additionally, feedback for F,L,H? 

If all x, then they are absent? Etc.

Moreover, FLASH has five distinct letters? Good.

Now, word validity? Yes, FLASH is a common English word.

So we choose FLASH.

But let's think: from ANGST, we got T absent? So if secret has T? We rule out? We already know T absent? So no issue? 

Similarly, F,L,H can be ruled out if missing?

Therefore, good guess: FLASH

So response: <guess>FLASH</guess>

First, step by step thought process.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1: RAISE**  
     - R(x): Absent → R not in the word.  
     - A(-): Present but wrong position → A in the word, not at position 2.  
     - I(x): Absent → I not in the word.  
     - S(✓): Correct position → S at position 4.  
     - E(x): Absent → E not in the word.  
   - **Guess 2: ANGST**  
     - A(-): Present but wrong position → A in the word, not at position 1 (since ANGST had A at position 1).  
     - N(x): Absent → N not in the word.  
     - G(x): Absent → G not in the word.  
     - S(✓): Correct position → Confirms S at position 4 again.  
     - T(x): Absent → T not in the word.  

2. **Inferences and Constraints:**
   - **Fixed Position:** S is at position 4 → Secret word pattern: `_ _ _ S _`.  
   - **A is Present:** Must be at position 3 or 5 (positions 1 and 2 are eliminated: position 2 from RAISE feedback, position 1 from ANGST feedback).  
   - **Absent Letters:** R, I, E, N, G, T → Cannot use these in new guesses.  
   - **Available Letters:** Focus on common unused letters (e.g., B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y).  
     - Prioritize letters to maximize information if possible (e.g., L, C, H).  

3. **Objective for New Guess:**  
   - Test A's position: Guess should place A at position 3 or 5 to clarify its exact position.  
     - Option: Place A at position 3 to check if it's correct. If not, A must be at position 5.  
   - Include S at position 4.  
   - Introduce new common letters not yet tested to gather more clues (e.g., F, L, H).  
   - Avoid positions 1 and 2 for A.  

4. **Selecting a Valid Word:**  
   - Pattern: `_ _ A S _` or `_ _ _ S A` (since S at position 4 is fixed).  
   - Evaluate options:  
     - `FLASH` (F-L-A-S-H): A at position 3, S at position 4. New letters: F, L, H.  
       - If A is at position 3, it should show ✓.  
       - If A is at position 5, A at position 3 should show - (wrong position), and we’d infer A must be at position 5.  
     - Why FLASH?  
       - Meets all constraints: Uses S at position 4, A not at forbidden positions, avoids absent letters.  
       - Distinct letters: F, L, H are new and common enough to provide useful feedback.  
       - Valid English word (meaning a sudden burst of light or speed).  
     - Alternatives considered:  
       - `CLASH` (C-L-A-S-H) but L is repeated as in FLASH, and C isn't necessarily higher priority.  
       - Words like `CLASS` with S at position 5 were rejected due to potential redundancy (less new information).  

5. **Expected Feedback Benefits:**  
   - Clarifies A’s position (3 vs 5) directly.  
   - Tests F (position 1), L (position 2), and H (position 5) for presence/position, reducing uncertainty for future guesses.  
   - Avoids wasted letters: No guesses from the absent list (R,I,E,N,G,T).

S is in the word and it\'s in the correct position (since it\'s the fourth letter, we know the fourth letter of the secret word is S).\n2. A is in the word but not in the second position (since it was the second letter in our guess).\n3. R, I, and E are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, we can summarize:\n- Known correct position: fourth letter is S.\n- Letters that must be included: A (somewhere else, not at position 2).\n- Letters that are ruled out: R, I, E.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain R, I, or E.\n\nNow, since S is in the fourth position, let\'s denote the word as _ _ _ S _, where the fourth character is S.\n\nWe also know that A is somewhere in the word, but not at position 2.

Also, avoid letters R, I, E.\n\nLet me brainstorm some words:\n- CLASS: contains C,L,A,S,S? Wait, CLASS has two S\'s? But our guess is five distinct letters? No, words can have repeated letters? Yes, but in WORDLE, words might have repeated letters, but in this case we don\'t know. However, in the feedback, we didn\'t have repeated letters here. But CLASS: we have C,L,A,S,S? Actually, CLASS has only 4 distinct letters: C,L,A,S. And S repeated? But position: CLASS? C1, L2, A3, S4, S5? Wait, CLASS is C-L-A-S-S, so fifth letter is S? But it\'s five letters? Actually, CLASS is 5 letters: positions 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S.\n\nBut in our case, position 4 is S, that\'s fixed. But we can try CLASS? But we need to see if it qualifies.\n\nHowever, note in feedback we got S with a check, so S is in the word and correct position, but if the word has multiple S, it might be an issue? Actually, the feedback handles multiple letters separately. So we can use words with repeated letters.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have R(x) so R out, I(x) out, E(x) out. So we cannot use R,I,E.\n\nNow, CLASS: positions 1:C, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:S. It has A at position 3 and two S\'s.\n\nBut we know S is at position 4, which is correct, so if we use CLASS, position 4 is S, so that is good. Position 3 is A, which might be correct or not, but we know A is somewhere so we are testing A at position 3.\n\nAlso, it introduces L and C.\n\nBut CLASS has S at the end too? So fifth letter S. But we don\'t know the fifth letter yet.\n\nAnother word: PLAYS: P-L-A-Y-S. But A is at position 3, S at 5? But position 4 is Y? That\'s not S? No, we need position 4 to be S.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be S.\n\nList of words with fourth letter S?\nFor example:\n- BASIS: B-A-S-I-S? But I is ruled out? We cannot use I because I was marked absent.\nBasis: B1, A2, S3, I4, S5. But position 4 is I? No, we need position 4 to be S.\n\nPerhaps: THASP? Not a word.\n\nCommon words: GLASS, CLASS, BRASS (but B is not ruled out? But BRASS has R? R is ruled out? R is marked absent so we cannot have R).\n\nSo BRASS has R, so invalid.\n\nFLASK: F-L-A-S-K: position 4 is S? F1, L2, A3, S4, K5. So A is at position 3.\n\nAnd F,L,K are new letters.\n\nSimilarly, TASKS: T-A-S-K-S? T1,A2,S3,K4,S5? S3 is third? But position 4 is K? Not S.\n\nI need the pattern: fourth letter must be S. So ???S?.\n\nWords: \n- with S at position 4: it\'s less common in English? Like glasses? But five letters.\n\nPossible options: \n- ANGST: A-N-G-S-T. But position 4 is S? A1,N2,G3,S4,T5. But also, A is at position 1? And we can try this? But ANGST has A at position 1.\n\nNow, we know A is in the word but not at position 2. Position 1 is valid for A.\n\nANGST does not have R,I,E? Check: no R, no I, no E. Good.\n\nAlso: CLASP: C-L-A-S-P, but S at position 4? C1,L2,A3,S4,P5? A at position 3.\n\nGAUSS? Like Gauss? But G-A-U-S-S? Is it common? It\'s a proper noun, might not be acceptable. Also, repeated S.\n\nBut in WORD, it should be a common word.\n\nWe need valid English words.\n\nAnother: PASS? four letters. Five letters: PILES? But I is out.\n\nPerhaps: OASIS? O-A-S-I-S. Position: O1,A2,S3,I4,S5. Position 4 is I? And S at position 3? Not position 4.\n\nWe need position 4 specifically to be S.\n\nSo ???S? : five letters with S at the fourth position.\n\nCommon ones: CLASS, GLASS, BRASS (but R ruled out), FLASK, TASKS? T-A-S-K-S? Positions: T1,A2,S3,K4,S5? S3 and S5, so position 4 is K? So no.\n\nFLASH? F-L-A-S-H: F1,L2,A3,S4,H5? Yes, S at position 4. And A at position 3.\n\nBut H is not ruled out.\n\nSimilarly, CLASH: C-L-A-S-H? But A at position 3? And S at 4.\n\nBut we have rule out: R,I,E, so Clash is C,L,A,S,H — no problem.\n\nOr SMASH: S-M-A-S-H? But S at position 1 and 4? But we don\'t know about multiple S.\n\nBut in our feedback, we have S only at position 4 marked, so if secret has only one S, that\'s ok.\n\nBut SMASH: S1,M2,A3,S4,H5. We have A at position 3.\n\nPotential words:\n- CLASS (A at 3, and S at 4 and 5)\n- FLASK (A at 3, S at 4)\n- CLASH (A at 3, S at 4)\n- GLASS (A at 3, S at 4,5)\n- PLASM? Not a word.\n- TASKS: not S at 4.\n\nAnother: OASIS? O1,A2,S3,I4,S5? Position 4 is I? Not S.\n\nBASIS? B1,A2,S3,I4,S5? Position 4 I? No.\n\nMust have position 4=S.\n\nOther words: GRASS? but R.\n\nCAVAS? Not a word.\n\nDASH? no.\n\nPerhaps: YEADS? No.\n\nFLUBS? No.\n\nFocus on words with A and S at position 4.\n\nNow back to our info: we know A is in word but not at position 2, and we have position 4=S.\n\nIn ANGST, A is at position 1: A-N-G-S-T.\n\nWe can test A at position 1: if it is correct, we get check, else if A is present but wrong position, then we know it\'s position 3 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, in FLASK, A is at position 3.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word that minimizes unused letters.\n\nWe need to test A\'s position.\n\nAlso, introduce new common letters to get more info.\n\nFor example, T, O, N, L, C, U, etc.\n\nSince we know S is fixed at position 4, we can ignore that and focus on the other positions.\n\nOur second guess should have S at position 4.\n\nNow, where to put A? We have three choices: position 1, 3, or 5.\n\nPosition 2 is excluded.\n\nLet\'s try to put A at position 1: word pattern A _ _ S _\n\nThen we fill with new letters, avoiding R,I,E.\n\nExample: ANTSY? But ANTSY: A1,N2,T3,S4,Y5? S at position 4? Yes. But ANTSY has N,T,S,Y? S at 4? A1,N2,T3,S4,Y5. Also, no R,I,E.\n\nBut we have S fixed at 4, but ANTSY has T at 3 and Y at 5.\n\nBut does it test A? A at position 1? Yes.\n\nAnother: AGASS? Not a word.\n\nAULAS? Not common.\n\nANGST: A1,N2,G3,S4,T5. This is a word? Meaning? ANGST is a common English word, meaning anxiety. Yes.\n\nWe can use ANGST.\n\nAnother: ACHES? But E is ruled out? Cannot, E is out.\n\nSo ANGST is acceptable? G is not ruled out.\n\nSimilarly, what about words with A at position 3: like CLASH: C1,L2,A3,S4,H5.\n\nOr FLASK: F1,L2,A3,S4,K5.\n\nOr CLASS: C1,L2,A3,S4,S5.\n\nBut CLASS has two S\'s, might give extra info.\n\nNow, words with A at position 5: pattern _ _ _ S A\n\nFor example: TULSA? T-U-L-S-A? Positions: T1,U2,L3,S4,A5? So A at position 5.\n\nAnd U,L,T are new.\n\nBut is TULSA a common word? It\'s a city, might be accepted? But perhaps not considered common.\n\nOther? BASIS? But we have position 4 must be S, but BASIS has S at 3? No.\n\nRUSSA? Not a word.\n\nURSA? Four letters.\n\nQUART? Not.\n\nSo words with A at position 5 are rare? Like BURSA? But R out.\n\nORGAN? O-R-G-A-N? Position 4? G? Not S.\n\nSo hard to find common words with A at position 5 and S at position 4.\n\nTherefore, perhaps position 1 or 3 is better.\n\nNow, to decide between ANGST (A at 1) or something like CLASS/FLASK (A at 3).\n\nGiven we only have limited guesses, we want to maximize information.\n\nIf we choose ANGST with A at position 1:\n- If A is correct, we get ✓ at position 1.\n- If A is not at 1 but in word, we get - which tells us A must be at position 3 or 5.\n- If we don\'t see A in feedback? But we know A is present from the first guess? Exactly, because first guess had A marked as present. So A must be in the word. Therefore, if ANGST has A at 1 and feedback says A at 1 is x, that contradicts? Wait no: the feedback would return A as - meaning present but wrong position? Since we know it should be in the word.\n\nBecause in first guess, A was marked as present (but wrong position). So A is definitely in the word. Therefore, in ANGST:\n- If position 1 is ✓ for A, then A is first.\n- If position 1 is - for A, then A is at position 3 or 5? But position 1 is wrong position? No: the feedback shows per letter.\n\nIf we guess ANGST:\n- Position 1: A. If A is not at position 1, but A is in word, then it will be marked as present (-), meaning A is at some other position (3 or 5). \nBut the word has positions: we have position 4 is fixed S.\n\nIn ANGST, positions: \n1: A -> if correct ✓, else -\n2: N -> unknown\n3: G -> unknown\n4: S -> fixed ✓\n5: T -> unknown\n\nSo, if A is not at position 1, then it will be marked -, meaning A is at position 3 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, we get feedback on N,G,T.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess FLASK: positions F1,L2,A3,S4,K5.\nWe know S4 will be ✓. \nA3: if correct ✓, else -? But A must be in word, so if not at 3, - meaning at 1 or 5? But we don\'t have position 1,5, etc.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nGiven that position 2 is ruled out for A (from first feedback), position1 and position3 are both good candidates.\n\nIn terms of letter frequency, after avoiding R,I,E, common letters: T,N,L,O,C,U,D,H,K,M,P.\n\nSo using those.\n\nANGST uses N,G,S,T. S is fixed. So new letters: N,G,T.\n\nFLASK uses F,L,A,S,K. S fixed. New: F,L,K.\n\nCLASS uses C,L,A,S,S. New: C,L.\n\nWhich letters give more coverage? \n\nPerhaps L and T are common? But T in ANGST.\n\nBut let\'s think: if we choose ANGST, we test A at position1 and also introduce N,G,T.\n\nSimilarly, FLASK tests A at position3 and introduces F,L,K.\n\nSince K is less common than T or N, ANGST might be better?\n\nCLASS? But CLASS has two S, might not reveal much about the fifth position? Because if the secret word has S at position5, it would show ✓ at position4 and position5? But we don\'t know if the word has multiple S.\n\nTo keep it simple, I choose ANGST.\n\nBecause it tests A at a new position (position1) and covers common consonants.\n\nSo guess: ANGST\n\nBut confirm: ANGST? A-N-G-S-T. Positions: 1:A, 2:N, 3:G, 4:S, 5:T.\n\nBut in feedback, S is at position4, so that will be ✓.\n\nWe hope to see about A.\n\nLet\'s see: if the secret word is for example FLASH? But FLASH has A at position3? So in ANGST, A is at position1, which for FLASH, A is not at 1, so it would be marked -? Meaning present elsewhere? Which is true, position3.\n\nThen position3:G? For FLASH, position3 is A, so G is incorrect? x.\n\nAlso, positions: ANGST vs FLASH: A in FLASH: position3, so in ANGST, A at position1 is wrong position, so -, and S4 ✓, and N2,L are different? FLASH: L at2? N vs L? Not same.\n\nAnyway, ANGST is a valid word.\n\nPerhaps CLOUT? No S.\n\nI think ANGST is acceptable.\n\nAnother common word: SLATE? But S is at position1? Slate is S-L-A-T-E. Position4 is T? Not S. And also E is ruled out.\n\nDRAIN? R and I out, also not S at4.\n\nSo I think ANGST is fine.\n\nTherefore, second guess: ANGST\n\nBut we must write it in the format.\n\nStep by step:\n\nThought:\n- From feedback: S at position4 is correct.\n- A present but not position2.\n- R, I, E absent.\n- Need new guess with S at position4 and A not at position2 (so elsewhere).\n- Choose word ANGST to test A at position1, and introduce new letters N,G,T.\n- Avoid using R,I,E.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, I, and E are absent from the secret word.\n- A is present but not in the second position.\n- S is present and in the correct position (fourth letter).\n\nNow:\n- The secret word has S at position 4: pattern: _ _ _ S _\n- A must be somewhere, but not position 2—so position 1, 3, or 5.\n- Avoid R, I, E in the new guess.\n- To maximize information, test A at position 1 using a word with common unused letters (like N, G, T).\n\n""ANGST"" fits:\n- Position 1: A (tests if A is here or elsewhere)\n- Position 2: N (new letter)\n- Position 3: G (new letter)\n- Position 4: S (confirmed, skip feedback)\n- Position 5: T (new letter)\n- Uses no R, I, E.\n\nIf feedback for A is:\n- ✓: A at position 1\n- -: A must be at position 3 or 5\n- Also, feedback for N, G, T will provide new clues.\n\nThus, ""ANGST"" is a strategic second guess.\n\n<guess>ANGST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: ANGST -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(x) G(x) S(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\n**Guess 1: RAISE**\n- R(x) : absent\n- A(-) : present, wrong position\n- I(x) : absent\n- S(✓) : correct position\n- E(x) : absent\n\n**Guess 2: ANGST**\n- A(-) : present, wrong position\n- N(x) : absent\n- G(x) : absent\n- S(✓) : correct position (as before)\n- T(x) : absent\n\n**Known so far:**\n1. **S is the 4th letter.** (fixed)\n2. **A is present but not in position 2 (from RAISE), and not in position 1 (from ANGST feedback).** \n   - Why? In ANGST, A was in position 1 and got a ""-"", meaning it is present but not at position 1. So A must be at position 3 or 5 (since positions 2 and 1 are ruled out).\n3. **Absent letters:** R, I, E, N, G, T. So we must avoid these letters: no R, I, E, N, G, T.\n4. Also, from ANGST, S is still at position 4 and correct, so that remains.\n\n**Therefore:**\n- Secret word pattern: _ _ _ S _\n- A must be at position 3 or 5 (since 1 and 2 are ruled out).\n- We need to avoid letters R, I, E, N, G, T.\n\n**Possible positions for A:**\n- Position 3: so pattern: _ _ A S _\n- Position 5: so pattern: _ _ _ S A\n\n**New guess must:**\n- Have S at position 4.\n- Include A at position 3 or 5 (to confirm which one).\n- Use only letters that are not ruled out. Available letters include common consonants/vowels like B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (avoid R,I,E,N,G,T).\n- Also, avoid positions: A cannot be at 1 or 2.\n\nTo maximize information, we want to test both possibilities:\n- If we put A at position 3, we can confirm if it\'s correct or if position 5 must be considered.\n- If we put A at position 5, same idea.\n\nBut since we have limited guesses, we should also introduce new common letters to get more clues.\n\n**Option 1: Test A at position 3.**\nPattern: _ _ A S _\nWe need to fill positions 1,2,5 with new letters (avoiding R,I,E,N,G,T).\n\nPossible words: \n- CLASS: C L A S S? But we used S? Position 4 is S, and if we have another S at 5? Also, CLASS has S at 5? And it uses L and C? But we haven\'t ruled out L or C.\nHowever, CLASS has \'L\' and \'C\', but also the fifth letter is S? Let\'s check: C1, L2, A3, S4, S5.\n\nBut note: from RAISE, we have S(✓) for position 4. If CLASS is guessed, S at position 4 will be ✓, S at position 5 might be something: if the secret word has S at position 5, we\'ll get ✓ at position 5? But if not, we might get - or x? Also, A at position 3: if correct, ✓, else -?\n\nBut we know A is present, so it will either be ✓ if at position 3 or - if at position 5? Anyway, we are testing.\n\nBut CLASS has S at position 4 and 5. But we are only sure about position 4 so far. \n\nOther words: FLASH? F L A S H? Positions: F1, L2, A3, S4, H5? Avoids R,I,E,N,G,T? Yes, uses F,L,H.\n\nAnd F,L,H are new. Not ruled out? So FLASH could be a good guess? \nBut we are testing A at position 3.\n\nIf we guess FLASH:\n- Position 1: F\n- Position 2: L\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 4: S (already known)\n- Position 5: H\n\nFeedback can tell us about F, L, A, H.\n\nIf A is at position 3, we get A as ✓? If not (meaning A is at position 5), we get A as -? Because A is present but not at 3? Then we know A must be at 5? \n\nSimilarly, if we put A at position 5.\n\nBut let\'s also think of words with A at position 5? Pattern: _ _ _ S A\nFor example: PULSA? Not common word.\nOr MANSA? But N is ruled out? N absent.\nORCHS? No.\nSo fewer common words? Available: words like KELPS? K E L P S? But E is ruled out? E absent? Cannot.\nOr BURPS? R and E? Rules out.\n\nSo better to test A at position 3? And use words like FLASH.\n\nOther possibilities: CLASH? C L A S H? Similar to FLASH? C-L-A-S-H.\n\nOr PLAST? Not a word? Plastic too long.\n\nSo FLASH and CLASH are options? Both have pattern: ? ? A S ?\n\nNow, how to choose? Consider unused letter frequency.\n\nLetters available: among most common: O, L, U, C, D, H, F, M, P, etc.\n\nBoth FLASH and CLASH use common letters.\n\nAnother word: SMASH? S-M-A-S-H? But S at position 1? Which would be? Position: S1, M2, A3, S4, H5? S at position 1? But we don\'t know if S is present at position 1? Could be? Also, S at position 4 is known? But if secret word has S at position 1, we might have conflict? But our first guess had R,A,I,S,E: S at position 4 was S? And we didn\'t have S elsewhere? So no information? \n\nIn FLASH: we have F,L,A,S,H: F,L,H are new and can provide info.\n\nSimilarly, CLASH: C,L,A,S,H: C new? L same? H same.\n\nBut FLASH: letters F,L,H not used? CLASH uses C,L,H? \n\nPerhaps FLASH is better? Because F might be less common? Actually, F and H are both in mid-frequency.\n\nTo introduce more vowels? But vowels: A is fixed? But we have few vowels left? Possible vowels: O,U,Y? Since A,I,E out? Not I,E are out? I and E absent? But O,U,Y are options? Also A is present? So not included. But we don\'t have much vowel info? No, we know A is present? But other vowels may exist? Like O,U?\n\nIn FLASH, there is no O,U? So we don\'t test vowels? Similarly CLASH.\n\nAnother word: BALSA? B A L S A? Positions: B1,A2,L3,S4,A5? But position 2: A is forbidden? We know A not position 2? So if we guess B1,A2? A2 would be invalid? Position 2: A should not be placed? So BALSA? Position 2: A, which we know is wrong? But the guess is possible? But it might waste a letter? Moreover, BALSA has two A? We don\'t know if secret has multiple A.\n\nBut if we guess BALSA: positions 1:B, 2:A, 3:L, 4:S, 5:A? Position 2: A? But we know from RAISE that A cannot be at position 2? So if we put A at position 2, it might get an x? Meaning not present? But we know A is present? Contradiction? Actually, no: if we place A at position 2, and secret word has A at position 3 or 5? Then the feedback might be x at position 2? Because it\'s not position 2? But A is present elsewhere? So it would be marked x for position 2? Meaning that letter is not correct and also not present? But we know A is present? How would feedback show it? Actually, in WORDLE rules: if the letter is in the word but in wrong position, it shows -. If not in word, x? But if we guess A at position 2, and secret has A only at position 3? Then position 2: A would be marked - if that A is meant to be the same? But we have only one A? Actually, the feedback per position? \n\nIn WORDLE: duplicate letters? For example, if secret word has one A, and guess has A at multiple positions: \n- If one is correct position, that gets ✓\n- Others: if in secret but wrong position? But since single A? Only one occurrence? So other A may get x? Or only if position?\n\nIt\'s checked per instance? But with single A? Only the A in exact position would be ✓? Others: if wrong position, -? Then when no more occurrence? But same letter: if secret has one A, and you guess two A, one at correct position gets ✓, the other at wrong position? Since A is used up, it might get x? \n\nExample: secret is FLASH? Position 3:A? If guess is BALSA? Then: position 1:B? Not in FLASH? x? Position 2:A? FLASH position 2 is L? So wrong position? But secret has A at position 3? So A is in the word? Then position 2:A should be marked as present (-) because it is in the word but wrong position? Then position 3:L? In BALSA, L at position 3? FLASH also L? position 3? FLASH: position 3 is A? No: FLASH positions F1,L2,A3,S4,H5? Secret: F-L-A-S-H? Position 2: L? Position 3: A? \n\nIf guess BALSA: B1,A2,L3,S4,A5? Secret FLASH?\n\nPosition 1: B vs F? Not match? B not in secret? x\nPosition 2: A vs L? Wrong? But secret has A? Since A is not at position 2? But A is at position 3? Therefore, position 2 guess A should be marked -? Because A is in secret at another position? Then position 3: L vs A? Secret position 3 is A? Guess is L? L is in secret at position 2? Therefore, L at position 3 secret? Not? Secret position 2 is L? So guess L at position 3? Secret position 2 is L? Wrong position? So L at guess position 3 should be -? Because L is present? Then position 4 S same? ✓ and position 5 A vs H? A present? But secret position 5 H? A not H? So A is in secret at position 3? We have already one A used? So position 5 A? Secret has one A? So might mark x? It\'s messy.\n\nSo better to avoid putting A at position 2? We know it\'s wrong.\n\nBack to previous: easier words are FLASH, CLASH?\n\nAlso, possible: OASIS? But positions: O1,A2,S3,I4,S5? But position 4? We need S at position 4? Position 3 is S? Not position 4? Incorrect pattern.\n\nMust S at position 4.\n\nAnother word: MACHO? Not.\n\nSo FLASH seems good.\n\nBut FLASH: positions F,L,A,S,H? We will put A at position 3? But we are testing that position.\n\nAlternative: if we want to test position 5? Pattern: _ _ _ S A\n\nWords? Like CAMPSA? Not.\nORGAN? Not S? \nULSA? No.\nSOUSA? S-O-U-S-A? Positions: S1,O2,U3,S4,A5? S at position 1 and 4? And O,U? But rule out O? U? Not ruled out? But we have S at position 1? If we guess SOUSA? Secret might or not? But SOUSA has S at position 4? Yes? \nBut SOUSA: S-O-U-S-A? Let\'s see: S1,O2,U3,S4,A5? \nSo S at position 4? ✓? A at position 5? To test position 5? And S at position 1? If S at position 1? Or not?\n\nBut we also want to test A at position 5?\n\nIn SOUSA, we introduce O,U,A? But A is known? And S? So new O and U? And avoid: no R,I,E,N,G,T? SOUSA: S,O,U? O and U new? But we are testing: position 1 S? But we don\'t know position 1? So S at position 1? Could be correct or wrong? If position 1 S? ✓? Else? Since S present, if wrong position might be -? But position 4 is S? Which is correct? So no issue? But might be marked separately? \n\nHowever, SOUSA has duplicate S? It might be acceptable? So:\nIf we guess SOUSA: \nPosition 1 S: could be ✓ if first letter S? Else, if S not at 1? Since we know S at 4, and no information about multiple S, it could be - or x? \nPosition 5 A: if A is at position 5? ✓? Else, if A at position 3? Then it would be -? Since A present? Or if not position 5? \n\nThis could work? But SOUSA might not be a common word? Is SOUSA a known English word? Like, Sousa is a surname? And March King? Acceptable? Probably? But in WORDLE, usually common words? Perhaps? But FLASH or CLASH more common.\n\nWe\'ll go with FLASH? Because it tests A at position 3? And if it\'s correct? We know? If not? Then A must be position 5? And also, we introduce F,L,H? Position 2: L in FLASH? \n\nSo pattern: F L A S H? Then? \n\nIf feedback: \n- A at position 3: ✓? Then we know A at position 3? \n- If A at position 3 is -? Meaning present wrong position? Since we placed it? But we know A is present? If position 3 not correct? Then it must be position 5? And we get - meaning A is elsewhere? \nThen we would know A position? \nAdditionally, feedback for F,L,H? \n\nIf all x, then they are absent? Etc.\n\nMoreover, FLASH has five distinct letters? Good.\n\nNow, word validity? Yes, FLASH is a common English word.\n\nSo we choose FLASH.\n\nBut let\'s think: from ANGST, we got T absent? So if secret has T? We rule out? We already know T absent? So no issue? \n\nSimilarly, F,L,H can be ruled out if missing?\n\nTherefore, good guess: FLASH\n\nSo response: <guess>FLASH</guess>\n\nFirst, step by step thought process.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**\n   - **Guess 1: RAISE**  \n     - R(x): Absent → R not in the word.  \n     - A(-): Present but wrong position → A in the word, not at position 2.  \n     - I(x): Absent → I not in the word.  \n     - S(✓): Correct position → S at position 4.  \n     - E(x): Absent → E not in the word.  \n   - **Guess 2: ANGST**  \n     - A(-): Present but wrong position → A in the word, not at position 1 (since ANGST had A at position 1).  \n     - N(x): Absent → N not in the word.  \n     - G(x): Absent → G not in the word.  \n     - S(✓): Correct position → Confirms S at position 4 again.  \n     - T(x): Absent → T not in the word.  \n\n2. **Inferences and Constraints:**\n   - **Fixed Position:** S is at position 4 → Secret word pattern: `_ _ _ S _`.  \n   - **A is Present:** Must be at position 3 or 5 (positions 1 and 2 are eliminated: position 2 from RAISE feedback, position 1 from ANGST feedback).  \n   - **Absent Letters:** R, I, E, N, G, T → Cannot use these in new guesses.  \n   - **Available Letters:** Focus on common unused letters (e.g., B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y).  \n     - Prioritize letters to maximize information if possible (e.g., L, C, H).  \n\n3. **Objective for New Guess:**  \n   - Test A\'s position: Guess should place A at position 3 or 5 to clarify its exact position.  \n     - Option: Place A at position 3 to check if it\'s correct. If not, A must be at position 5.  \n   - Include S at position 4.  \n   - Introduce new common letters not yet tested to gather more clues (e.g., F, L, H).  \n   - Avoid positions 1 and 2 for A.  \n\n4. **Selecting a Valid Word:**  \n   - Pattern: `_ _ A S _` or `_ _ _ S A` (since S at position 4 is fixed).  \n   - Evaluate options:  \n     - `FLASH` (F-L-A-S-H): A at position 3, S at position 4. New letters: F, L, H.  \n       - If A is at position 3, it should show ✓.  \n       - If A is at position 5, A at position 3 should show - (wrong position), and we’d infer A must be at position 5.  \n     - Why FLASH?  \n       - Meets all constraints: Uses S at position 4, A not at forbidden positions, avoids absent letters.  \n       - Distinct letters: F, L, H are new and common enough to provide useful feedback.  \n       - Valid English word (meaning a sudden burst of light or speed).  \n     - Alternatives considered:  \n       - `CLASH` (C-L-A-S-H) but L is repeated as in FLASH, and C isn\'t necessarily higher priority.  \n       - Words like `CLASS` with S at position 5 were rejected due to potential redundancy (less new information).  \n\n5. **Expected Feedback Benefits:**  \n   - Clarifies A’s position (3 vs 5) directly.  \n   - Tests F (position 1), L (position 2), and H (position 5) for presence/position, reducing uncertainty for future guesses.  \n   - Avoids wasted letters: No guesses from the absent list (R,I,E,N,G,T).\n\n<guess>FLASH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: ANGST -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(x) G(x) S(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: FLASH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess FLASH:
- F(x): absent
- L(x): absent
- A(✓): correct at position 3
- S(✓): correct at position 4 (already known)
- H(✓): correct at position 5

Key information:
1. From this feedback, we know:
   - A is at position 3: so pattern becomes _ _ A S _
   - S is at position 4: known
   - H is at position 5: so pattern becomes _ _ A S H
   - F and L are absent from the word: so we cannot use F or L.

2. Also, from previous feedback, we have absent letters: R, I, E, N, G, T, F, L.
   So absent: R, I, E, N, G, T, F, L.

3. Position 1 and 2: unknown, to be filled.

4. The secret word pattern: ? ? A S H

5. Letters we must avoid: R,I,E,N,G,T,F,L.

Available letters: Since we have many letters ruled out, we consider common letters not used:
- Available: B, C, D, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (any letter except absent ones)

We know the word ends with ""ASH"": so the pattern is _ _ A S H.

We need to guess the first two positions.

We should try to fill with common letters not used.

We must avoid F and L? Since they were absent? And also the previous ones.

Now, the word has positions:
- Position 1: unknown letter, must not be absent.
- Position 2: unknown letter, must not be absent.
- Positions 3,4,5 fixed as A,S,H respectively? So position 3=A, 4=S, 5=H.

So we need to guess position 1 and 2.

The word must be a valid English word of the form XYASH, where X and Y are letters not in the absent list.

Possible words: 
- CASH? but C1,A2,S3,H4? Wait: no: pattern must be X1,Y2,A3,S4,H5? So CASH is too short? We need exactly 5 letters? Or CASH is 4 letters? So 5-letter words ending with ""ASH""?

Common ones: 
- SMASH: S1,M2,A3,S4,H5? But S at position 1? Position 4: S? So S repeated? But we have used S? Also, M is a new letter? And S: is it allowed? We haven't ruled out multiple S? But in feedback, for RAISE: S was at position 4 marked correct? If there is another S?
But SMASH: positions 1:S, 2:M, 3:A, 4:S, 5:H? 
Absent letters: F,L,R,I,E,N,G,T? So M and S are available? But S: position 1? Previous guesses did not have S at position 1? So we don't know? Also, in RAISE, S was at position 4? So we didn't test position 1? So we can use S again? But we have S fixed at position 4? And another S? So SMASH: S at position 1 and position 4? Then, if we guess SMASH? Then we get feedback: position 1:S? Could be ✓? Or -? Depending on the secret? But we don't know if secret has S elsewhere? 

But note: from first guess: RAISE had S at position 4? And we got ✓? That doesn't preclude S elsewhere? Similarly, FLASH had no S at position 1? So we don't know? But now we are using SMASH? 

Also, other words: 
- TRASH? But T is absent? R absent? Cannot.
- BRASH? B1,R2,A3,S4,H5? But R is absent? Cannot.
- CRASH? C1,R2,A3,S4,H5? R absent? Cannot.
- PLASH? Not common? P L A S H? Wait, PLASH might be a word? But L absent? L ruled out? Cannot.
- DASH? D A S H? Four letters? So not.
- MASH? Four letters.
- Other: BASHE? Not? Only ASH at end? 

Thus, SMASH is a candidate? S M A S H? Avoids all absent letters? Uses M? Available.

But SMASH: S1,M2,A3,S4,H5? 
Now, H is at position 5? We already know H is correct? From FLASH? Yes? In FLASH feedback: H(✓) at position 5? So H at position 5 is correct? So same? 
But we are guessing H again? Which is known? But that's fine? Because it will show ✓? 

But perhaps we can have a word that doesn't repeat letters? But no, we don't care? To save a guess? 

But we have only 3 guesses left? We are on guess 4? Total 6? 

Also: CLASH? But C L A S H? But L absent? L ruled out? Cannot? FLASH feedback: L at position2? L(x)? So L absent? So CLASH would have L? Rule broken? Similarly, words with L cannot be used? 

So SMASH? Now, if secret word is exactly SMASH? Then we win? Else? 

But we can introduce more letters? We know positions 3,4,5 are A,S,H? So position 1 and 2 must be filled? To test possibilities? 

But SMASH tests two new letters: S and M? At position 1 and 2? But S is already used? We know S is in the word? But we don't know about position 1? 

Alternatively, we could use words that don't have S at position 1? To avoid repetition? But we don't have many options? 

Another word: MASH? Four letters? 

Or BASHE? Not? 

Or WAS? Three letters? 

So five-letter words: 
- WASH? Four? 
- Only one: SMASH seems common? 

Another: SQUAB? Not ASH? 

Words ending with ""ASH"": 
- AWASH? A W A S H? But position 3 is A? Fixed? So pattern: ? ? A S H? So cannot be AWASH? Because position 1:A? But we haven't ruled position 1? But A must be at position 3? So position 1 cannot be A? Because A is at position 3? And we may not have multiple A? From previous? We don't know? In RAISE: we had one A? Marked present? In ANGST: one A? Marked present? In FLASH: one A? Marked? In FLASH we guessed A at position 3? and got ✓? But no information about another A? So possibly multiple A? 

But pattern: if position 3=A? Fixed? So position 1 cannot be A? Likewise? 

So we must avoid A at position 1? 

So pattern: not A at position 1? But we already know position 1? Unknown? 

So words: 
- SMASH: S (position 1), M (position 2), then A S H? So S1,M2,A3,S4,H5?
- Or: CASH? Four letters? Or CYASH? Not.
- Or KASH? Four.

So SMASH? Or BMASH? Not a word? 

Rare: GNASH? G N A S H? But G absent? G ruled out? Cannot.

OR SHASH? S H A S H? Positions: S1,H2,A3,S4,H5? But H at position 2? And H at position 5? But H at position 5 we know? But position 2? H? We don't know? 

But SHASH? Is it a word? Meaning? Like, heraldry? Not common? 

Similarly, SQUASH? S Q U A S H? But S1,Q2,U3,A4,S5? But position 3? We need A at position 3? So pattern must be ? ? A S H? SQUASH: ? ? U A S? Positions: S1,Q2,U3,A4,S5? So position 4? A? But we need S at position 4? Conflict? So SQUASH: position 4 not S? And pattern ends with A S H? Not? SQUASH ends with U A S H? So position 3=U? Not A? 

So invalid pattern? 

Thus, SMASH appears the best common word? 

Another? Maybe? OM? Not? 

So possible: only SMASH? Or SH? 

We could choose another word that doesn't end with ASH? But positions 3,4,5 are fixed? So we must have pattern ? ? A S H? 

Therefore, guess SMASH? 

SMASH: S1, M2, A3, S4, H5? 
- We know positions 3,4,5: A,S,H? So they will all be ✓? 
- Position 1: S? We don't know? But S might be in the word at another position? Or not? 
- Position 2: M? New letter? 

If feedback:
- Position 1:S? If correct? ✓? Else? Could be -? Or x? 
- Position 2:M? x or -? 

Absent letters: F,L,R,I,E,N,G,T? So M? Only M tested? 

New? 

Given we have few options? SMASH is acceptable? 

But what if secret word is without S at position 1? For example, another word? 

Other words: 
- ABASH? A B A S H? Positions: A1,B2,A3,S4,H5? But position 1:A? And position 3:A? So possible? But we avoided A at position 1? Because? From feedback: we don't know about position 1? But we don't have A ruled out at position 1? Actually? From previous: we only know A not position 2? Then in ANGST we placed A at position 1? Got -? Meaning A present but not at position 1? So A cannot be at position 1? Therefore, position 1 cannot be A? 

So ABASH? Position 1:A? But we know A is not at position 1? So forbidden? So cannot. 

Similarly? DBASH? Not? 

CBASH? Not common? 

So SMASH? 

Or perhaps: WASHY? W A S H Y? But pattern: W1,A2,S3,H4,Y5? But position 3? Must be A? But here position 3=S? Conflict? We need position 3=A? So pattern ? ? A S H? 

Position 4? Must be S? In WASHY: position 3=S? Position 4=H? Not matching? 

So SMASH? Or GA? Not. 

Therefore, I think the common word is SMASH? 

Sometimes PASH? Not common? 

So we'll use SMASH? 

Step by step:

- Fixed positions: position 3=A, position4=S, position5=H? So pattern? _ _ A S H? 
- Unknown positions: 1 and 2? 
- Must use letters from available: avoid R,I,E,N,G,T,F,L? 
- SMASH? S at position1? M at position2? S at position4? 

If we guess SMASH? And if the secret word is SMASH? Then correct? Else? Then feedback? 

For example? If secret is for example? There might be other words? SMASH, and perhaps? Not? 

Since S is at position 4? And we guess S at position 1? If S is also at position 1? Then marked ✓? Else? Might be x? Or -? 

Also? M? If present? 

But we think it's the best guess? 

Perhaps CASHY? But C A S H Y? Position 3? Must be A? In CASHY? Position 2:A? But we know A not at position 2? So invalid? 

Similarly? 

So SMASH? 

Therefore? Guess: SMASH

But let's write the response? 

Thought process:
- New information: position 3=A, position 5=H? So word has 3,4,5? fixed: A,S,H? 
- Position 1 and 2 unknown? 
- Absent letters: R,I,E,N,G,T,F,L? 
- Pattern is ? ? A S H? 
- Candidate words? Almost? Only SMASH fits? Common English word? 
- SMASH tests new letters S and M? Where S might be duplicated? But acceptable? 
- If not SMASH? The feedback will provide? For instance? Position 1 and 2?

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

- **Analyze Feedback:**  
  - Guess 1: RAISE → R(absent), A(present but wrong position), I(absent), S(correct position 4), E(absent).  
  - Guess 2: ANGST → A(present but wrong position), N(absent), G(absent), S(correct position 4), T(absent).  
  - Guess 3: FLASH → F(absent), L(absent), A(correct position 3), S(correct position 4), H(correct position 5).  

- **Key Insights:**  
  1. **S is at position 4** (confirmed since Guess 1).  
  2. **A is at position 3** (confirmed in Guess 3).  
  3. **H is at position 5** (newly confirmed in Guess 3).  
  4. **Absent letters**: R, I, E, N, G, T, F, L (from all feedback).  
  5. **Secret word pattern**: Positions 3, 4, 5 are fixed as `A, S, H` → Pattern: `_ _ A S H`.  
  6. **Position requirements**:  
     - Position 1 and 2 must be filled with letters not in the absent list (e.g., B, C, D, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y).  
     - The word must be a valid English 5-letter word ending in ""ASH"".  

- **Evaluate Word Options:**  
  - Common words fitting `_ _ A S H`:  
    - `SMASH` (S at position 1, M at position 2, A at 3, S at 4, H at 5) is the strongest candidate:  
      - Uses `S` at position 1 (possible duplication but not ruled out, as feedback only confirmed S at position 4).  
      - Introduces `M` (new, untested letter) at position 2.  
      - Avoids all absent letters.  
    - Other options (like `ABASH`, `CRASH`, `BRASH`) are invalid:  
      - Contain absent letters (e.g., R in ""CRASH"") or violate position constraints (A cannot be at position 1 or 2).  
  - **Why SMASH?**  
    - Tests if `S` appears at position 1 (feedback will clarify via ✓, -, or x).  
    - Tests `M` at position 2 (new letter for information).  
    - If correct, solves the puzzle; if not, feedback narrows options significantly.  

- **Strategy:**  
  - Prioritize `SMASH` to leverage commonality and maximize feedback on positions 1 and 2.  
  - Absent letters are avoided (no R, I, E, N, G, T, F, L).  

<guess>SMASH</guess>",SMASH,"We are given feedback for the third guess FLASH:
- F(x): absent
- L(x): absent
- A(✓): correct at position 3
- S(✓): correct at position 4 (already known)
- H(✓): correct at position 5

Key information:
1. From this feedback, we know:
   - A is at position 3: so pattern becomes _ _ A S _
   - S is at position 4: known
   - H is at position 5: so pattern becomes _ _ A S H
   - F and L are absent from the word: so we cannot use F or L.

2. Also, from previous feedback, we have absent letters: R, I, E, N, G, T, F, L.
   So absent: R, I, E, N, G, T, F, L.

3. Position 1 and 2: unknown, to be filled.

4. The secret word pattern: ? ? A S H

5. Letters we must avoid: R,I,E,N,G,T,F,L.

Available letters: Since we have many letters ruled out, we consider common letters not used:
- Available: B, C, D, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (any letter except absent ones)

We should try to fill with common letters not used.

We must avoid F and L? Since they were absent? And also the previous ones.

Now, the word has positions:
- Position 1: unknown letter, must not be absent.
- Position 2: unknown letter, must not be absent.
- Positions 3,4,5 fixed as A,S,H respectively? So position 3=A, 4=S, 5=H.

So we need to guess position 1 and 2.

The word must be a valid English word of the form XYASH, where X and Y are letters not in the absent list.

Possible words: 
- CASH? but C1,A2,S3,H4? Wait: no: pattern must be X1,Y2,A3,S4,H5? So CASH is too short? We need exactly 5 letters? Or CASH is 4 letters? So 5-letter words ending with ""ASH""?

Common ones: 
- SMASH: S1,M2,A3,S4,H5? But S at position 1? Position 4: S? So S repeated? But we have used S? Also, M is a new letter? And S: is it allowed? We haven't ruled out multiple S? But in feedback, for RAISE: S was at position 4 marked correct? If there is another S?

Absent letters: F,L,R,I,E,N,G,T? So M and S are available? But S: position 1? Previous guesses did not have S at position 1? So we don't know? Also, in RAISE, S was at position 4? So we didn't test position 1? So we can use S again? But we have S fixed at position 4? And another S? So SMASH: S at position 1 and position 4? Then, if we guess SMASH? Then we get feedback: position 1:S? Could be ✓? Or -? Depending on the secret? But we don't know if secret has S elsewhere?

Perhaps CASHY? But C A S H Y? Position 3? Must be A? In CASHY? Position 2:A? But we know A not at position 2? So invalid? 

Similarly? 

So SMASH? 

Therefore? Guess: SMASH

But let's write the response? 

Thought process:
- New information: position 3=A, position 5=H? So word has 3,4,5? fixed: A,S,H? 
- Position 1 and 2 unknown? 
- Absent letters: R,I,E,N,G,T,F,L? 
- Pattern is ? ? A S H? 
- Candidate words? Almost? Only SMASH fits? Common English word? 
- SMASH tests new letters S and M? Where S might be duplicated? But acceptable? 
- If not SMASH? The feedback will provide? For instance? Position 1 and 2?### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

- **Analyze Feedback:**  
  - Guess 1: RAISE → R(absent), A(present but wrong position), I(absent), S(correct position 4), E(absent).  
  - Guess 2: ANGST → A(present but wrong position), N(absent), G(absent), S(correct position 4), T(absent).  
  - Guess 3: FLASH → F(absent), L(absent), A(correct position 3), S(correct position 4), H(correct position 5).  

- **Key Insights:**  
  1. **S is at position 4** (confirmed since Guess 1).  
  2. **A is at position 3** (confirmed in Guess 3).  
  3. **H is at position 5** (newly confirmed in Guess 3).  
  4. **Absent letters**: R, I, E, N, G, T, F, L (from all feedback).  
  5. **Secret word pattern**: Positions 3, 4, 5 are fixed as `A, S, H` → Pattern: `_ _ A S H`.  
  6. **Position requirements**:  
     - Position 1 and 2 must be filled with letters not in the absent list (e.g., B, C, D, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y).  
     - The word must be a valid English 5-letter word ending in ""ASH"".  

- **Evaluate Word Options:**  
  - Common words fitting `_ _ A S H`:  
    - `SMASH` (S at position 1, M at position 2, A at 3, S at 4, H at 5) is the strongest candidate:  
      - Uses `S` at position 1 (possible duplication but not ruled out, as feedback only confirmed S at position 4).  
      - Introduces `M` (new, untested letter) at position 2.  
      - Avoids all absent letters.  
    - Other options (like `ABASH`, `CRASH`, `BRASH`) are invalid:  
      - Contain absent letters (e.g., R in ""CRASH"") or violate position constraints (A cannot be at position 1 or 2).  
  - **Why SMASH?**  
    - Tests if `S` appears at position 1 (feedback will clarify via ✓, -, or x).  
    - Tests `M` at position 2 (new letter for information).  
    - If correct, solves the puzzle; if not, feedback narrows options significantly.  

- **Strategy:**  
  - Prioritize `SMASH` to leverage commonality and maximize feedback on positions 1 and 2.  
  - Absent letters are avoided (no R, I, E, N, G, T, F, L).",Guess 4: SMASH -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(✓) A(✓) S(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
