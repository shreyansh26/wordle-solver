We are starting the game. We need to make our first guess. Since we have no information yet, a good starting word should have a mix of common letters and vowels to maximize the feedback.

Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc., because they have common letters and a good mix of vowels and consonants.

I think ""CRATE"" is a solid first guess because:
- It contains common consonants (C, R, T) and two vowels (A, E).
- All letters are distinct, which helps in getting information about more letters.

So for the first guess, I choose ""CRATE"".
</think>
I need to make the first guess in the Wordle-style game. Since I have no prior information, I should choose a word that maximizes the potential for useful feedback. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to help identify letters in the secret word.

Ideal characteristics for a first guess:
- Includes common vowels (e.g., A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (e.g., R, S, T, L, N).
- Avoids repeating letters to test more unique characters.
- Examples of strong starter words: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""TRACE"".

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- It covers three common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, giving me feedback on five different characters.
- It's likely to provide substantial clues about the secret word's composition and positions.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word has the letter 'N' in the 4th position and 'E' in the 5th position? Because 'N' is at index 3 and 'E' at index 4 in ""crane"".

Let me index the positions (0-indexed):
c r a n e
0 1 2 3 4

Feedback: 
position 0: C -> x (not in word)
position 1: R -> - (in word but wrong position)
position 2: A -> x (not in word)
position 3: N -> ✓ (correct, so N is in position 3)
position 4: E -> ✓ (correct, so E is in position 4)

Therefore, the secret word ends with ""NE"" and has the form: _ _ _ N E

Moreover, we know:
- The letter R is in the word, but not at position 1. So R must be in position 0 or 2? But wait, positions 0 and 2 are currently unknown, and we know position 0 can't have C (since C is not in the word) and position 2 can't have A (since A is not in the word).

Also, we know that the word does not contain C or A.

Now, since 'R' is present but not in position 1, it must be in one of the remaining positions: 0, 1, or 2? Wait, positions are fixed. Actually, the word has five positions: 0,1,2,3,4.

We have:
Position 3: N
Position 4: E

So R must appear in one of positions 0, 1, or 2? But note that position 1 is where we placed R and it was wrong, so R must be in either position 0 or position 2.

But position 2 had 'A' which is not in the word, so R cannot be at position 2? No, wait: the feedback for position 1 (R) was ""-"" meaning R is in the word but not at that position. So R is at position 0, position 2, or position 3? But position 3 is N and we have a check, so if R were at position 3, that would conflict because N is there. However, the word can have multiple letters? But in this case, the feedback doesn't indicate multiple same letters unless they are. However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

But note: the feedback for position 1: R is marked as present but wrong position. Since position 3 is fixed as N and position 4 as E, and they are correct, then R must be either at position 0 or position 2.

We also know that the word does not contain C and A.

So the secret word is: [?] [?] [?] N E

Now, the letter R must be at position 0 or 2? Because positions 1,3,4 are: we tried R at position 1 and it wasn't there, and positions 3 and 4 are taken by N and E.

So possible positions for R are 0 or 2? But position 2 we haven't placed R yet? Actually, position 2 we had A which is absent, so R could be there.

So constraints:
- The word must have R in position 0 or position 2? Or possibly in a duplicate position? But we don't know about duplicates.

Since we don't have any duplicate letters yet, we assume no duplicates for now? But we must consider.

Also, we must guess a new word that is a valid English word.

What letters do we know?
Must include R in position 0 or 2, and must have N and E at the end.

So pattern: either R _ _ N E  or  _ ? R ? N E? No: if R is at position 0, then the word is R ? ? N E. If R is at position 2, then the word is ? ? R N E.

But the middle position (2) could be R? Or position 0.

Also, we need to avoid C and A? Because both were absent.

Now, we have two known letters: R (somewhere) and N and E at the end? Actually N and E are fixed at positions 3 and 4.

So let's list possible words? That might be too many. Instead, we can choose a guess that tests the possibilities.

For the second guess, we want to get more information about the positions, especially the first three positions.

We know R must be at position 0 or position 2? Or possibly position 1? But wait, position 1 had R in the first guess and it was marked as wrong position? But no, the feedback said R is present but at wrong position? Meaning the R in position 1 is not correct? So R must be in position 0 or 2? Because positions 3 has N and 4 has E? And they are correct? So they can't be replaced.

But what about duplicate letters? If the word were ""RENNE"" or something, but we don't know? However, we should consider that.

But without evidence of duplicates, we can proceed assuming no duplicates for now? Because with no duplicate feedback, it's safer to assume distinct until proven otherwise.

So we'll assume the secret word has distinct letters? But let's not assume that? However, we can choose our next guess to have all distinct letters to maximize information.

Therefore, our next guess should:
1. Confirm the possible position of R: we can try putting R in position 0 or position 2? And also test other common letters that have not been ruled out.

2. Avoid letters we know are absent (C and A).

3. Include N and E at positions 3 and 4? Well, in the feedback, we know N and E are correct at positions 3 and 4? So we should keep them the same? Because if we change them? The rules: each guess must be a valid word. And to confirm or get more information, if we don't fix N and E, we might lose that info? But since we know they are fixed and correct? We can preserve them? Because if we change, we might get wrong feedback? But actually, we already know N and E are in position? So if we change, we'll get incorrect feedback? Which is bad? Because we can save those positions and focus on the others.

Therefore, it's best to keep positions 3 and 4 as N and E in our next guess? Because they are correct? That way, we don't use extra guesses on known positions? And focus on the unknown positions? But is that required? It's not required? But if I change them, then if I put E in another position, I might confuse myself? But let me see.

Actually, the feedback will tell us per position? So if I change position 3 and 4? Then if I put a different letter at position 3? It might show I was wrong? But we know N and E are fixed? So I should keep them? Because if I don't, I risk losing that information? Moreover, having two letters fixed means we only have three letters to guess.

So for positions 3 and 4, we will always use N and E? Because they are fixed? So the next guess should have the form: ? ? ? N E

Now, we need to fill in the first three characters? We know R must be in the word, but not in position 1? So since positions 0,1,2 must contain R? And positions 3 and 4 are fixed? So effectively, position 1 cannot have R? Because we tried R at position 1 and it said present but wrong? And since position 3 is N? And we have fixed positions? So R must be at position 0 or position 2.

Therefore, in our next guess, we want to test:

Either put R at position 0 or position 2? And test other letters? But we can do that? But we also need to test possible letters for the other positions.

Since we have three positions to fill: 0,1,2? And one of them must be R? But we don't know which? And the other two must be letters that are not C or A? And probably other common letters.

A good strategy: we can choose to put R at position 0? For example, ""R _ _ N E"", but we need a valid word? Then we can test another letter? Or we can put R at position 2? Like ""? ? R N E""

But in either case, we have to guess a word? And it should maximize information? If we fix R at position 0, then if it is correct, we get a green? If not, then we know R must be at position 2? But then we lose an opportunity to test other letters? Alternatively, we can avoid placing R in either position? But we must include R? Because we know R is in the word? So wherever we put it? But we don't know where? But if we put it in a new position? For example, if we put R at position 0? Then we get feedback: if R is at position 0? Then ✓, else if? Then we know? Or if we put it at position 2? Similarly?

Since we must include R? And we must not put it at position 1? Because that was already tried? So either 0 or 2? The two possibilities? We can't avoid? So why not test one? For example, let's assume R is at position 0 and guess a word with R at 0? And then see feedback? But that might not be efficient? We can choose a word that has R at position 2? So we can narrow down? Or choose a word that has multiple possibilities tested? But with three positions to guess? We might need to guess more? And we have limited letters to test? So we can choose a word that contains common letters? That haven't been tried? And also either R at 0 or R at 2.

But we have to avoid C and A? Because they are not in the word? So excluding C and A? And also, we know the word has no C or A? So we can use other vowels? But note: position 2? If R is not at 2? Could be another letter? Or position 0? Even position 1? Position 1: we don't know what it is? But we tried with R? But it doesn't have to be R? However, we must have R in the word? So R must be at 0 or 2.

Let me list possible letters? But without knowing the dictionary? It's hard? Instead, let's think of common words ending with ""NE""? And that include R? With no C or A.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y

But since we must include R? And either at start or middle.

Common words? Like ""PRONE"", ""TRINE"", ""DRONE"", ""GRONE"" (invalid)? Or ""BRINE"", etc.

But to maximize information, we can choose a word that has unique letters? And from the common set.

For example, ""PRONE"": 
- P new letter? R at position 1? But wait? In our guess pattern, we have positions: 0,1,2,3,4? with 3 and 4 fixed as N and E? So if we guess ""PRONE"", then positions: 
P at 0, R at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4.

But note: position 1 is R? But in the first feedback, R was marked as present but wrong position? When we had crane: R at position 1 was marked ""-"" meaning R is in the word but not at position 1? So if we put R at position 1 again? It might mark wrong position again? Or if it were position 1? Then it would be green? But it can't be? Because we were told it's not at position 1? So we shouldn't put R at position 1 again? Because we know it's incorrect? And putting it again? We might get ""-"" again? Which gives no new information.

Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 1? For the next guess? So we cannot use a word with R at position 1? Because it will be wrong? And we already know that? So ""PRONE"" has R at position 1? Which we know is wrong? So we don't need to test it? And it wastes a position? So we should not choose a word with R at position 1? Because we know it's incorrect? And that letter position needs testing? So we should put R at position 0 or position 2.

Positions to fill: 0,1,2? We can put:
Option 1: R at position 0? Then word: R ? ? N E? Or
Option 2: ? ? R N E

Now, what words are there?
For ""R ? ? N E"": common words: R?INE? But I is vowel? But also, ""ROUND"" doesn't end with NE? ""RANGE"" has A and we know A is absent? ""RICED""? But that has common letters? Possible words for ""R ? ? N E"": 
- ROUTE? But T and U? But ""ROUTE"" ends with TE? Not NE? 
Can you think of words? ""RINS E"" -> wait? ""RINSE"" has S? But ""RINSE"" ends with SE? Not NE? 
""ROBIN E""? Not? None? Perhaps ""RIPEN""? But that's R I P E N? Positions: R at 0, I at 1, P at 2, E at 3, N at 4? But we need N at 3 and E at 4? So ""RIPEN"" has E at 3 and N at 4? Which is wrong? We need position 3: N? Position 4: E? So it must be R?x?N E? 

Let me find words that end with ""NE"": which have an N? Then E? So consonant?N?E? So it might be vowel?N?E? Or consonant? But ""? N E""? So the word ends with ""NE"", like ""AISNE"" not common? Possible words: BRINE, TRINE, PRUNE, CRONE? But C and A? Avoid C? CRONE has C? Which we know is absent? 
Words ending with NE: include IRENE? Too short? ""UNION"" doesn't? Let's think common five-letter words: 
BRINE? B-R-I-N-E? but A and C are out? No C? 
BRINE: B, R, I, N, E? and B is new? 
But if we do R? ? N E? If we put BRINE? Then position 0 is B, position 1 is R? But we cannot have R at position 1? Because we know it's wrong? So BRINE has R at position 1? Which we must avoid.

If we want position 0: R and position 1: not R? Position 2: something? 
Word: ""ROU N E""? Not? ""R"" + something? ""ROME""? not NE? 
""RANDE""? But A? and not? 
""RANGE"" has A? 
""RONDO""? not? 

Perhaps ""R? N E"" with two letters? There might not be common English words? 
What about ""TRINE"": T-R-I-N-E? Here, position 1 is R? Which is forbidden? 
Or ""DRONE"": D-R-O-N-E? Again R at position 1? 
""PRONE"": P-R-O-N-E? R at position 1? 
Many end with ""NE"" have the vowel? But we need a word with R at position 0? Which is rare? 
Alternatively, no R at start? Then put R at position 2: word pattern ? ? R N E? 
Then we can have: ? ? R N E? e.g., ""BAR N E""? But we know A is bad? ""CORED""? not NE? 
Possible: ""HORN E"" -> ""HORNE"" is a surname? Or ""borne""? B-O-R-N-E? which has O? and B? 
""B O R N E"": positions: B at 0, O at 1, R at 2, N at 3, E at 4? Perfect? So ""BORNE"" 
""P O R N E"" -> porny? not? ""PORNE"" not word? 
""L O R N E"" -> surname? 
""S O R N E"" -> not common? 
But ""BORNE"" is a word? Meaning carried? 
""BORNE"" has O? 
We can also have ""BYRNE""? B-Y-R-N-E? positions: B at 0, Y at 1, R at 2, N at 3, E at 4? But Y at position 1? And it's valid? 

So possible words for pattern ? ? R N E: with R at position2: BORNE, BYRNE, CORNE (not? Cornea, but 6 letters?), but we avoid C? 
HOR? HORNE is not five? Horn, 4?
""DIR N E"" -> DIRNE not word? 
""WORN E"" -> WORNE archaic? 
Maybe ""TIRESOME"" no? 
Common words: ""URINE"" has U at 0, R at 1? But position 1 is R which we must avoid? 
""CARNE"" has C and A? 
""PER? PERNE"" not common? 
So viable options: ""BORNE"" or ""BYRNE""? 

""BORNE"" is more common?

Or ""MIN R E"" -> MINRE not a word? 
""LINED""? not R? 

Another idea: ""GRIM E N"" no? We need exact? 

Since R can be at position 0? But hard to find words? Let's try: R?x?N E? 
""RES? RESIN"" but ends with IN? not NE? ""RESEN""? not word? 
""RIPEN"" -> R-I-P-E-N, but E at 3? Not NE? 
""RISEN"" -> R-I-S-E-N? Then E at 3? 
To have N at position 3? So ""R I S N E""? ""RISNE"" not a word? 
""R E I N E"" -> ""REINE"" is French? Not common? 
""R U N E S? 5:? ""RUNES"" but E at 4? And N at 3? So ""R U N E S"" has N at 3 and E at 4? RUNES: R U N E S? Position 0: R? Position 1: U? Position 2: N? Position 3: E? Position 4: S? But in our, position 3 must be N? And position 4 E? So not RUNES? 
Do any words start with R and end with NE? Common? ""RAIN E""? Has A? ""RENT E""? Not 5? 
 ""RANCE"" has C? 
 Very hard? Maybe ""RHYME""? But ends with ME? 
 ""ROGUE""? 
 It seems there are the best words with R at position 2?

Therefore, better to put R at position 2? And choose a word with that pattern.

So pattern: _ _ R N E? So positions 0 and 1 need letters? Not C or A? And common.

Possible words:
- ""BORNE"": B O R N E? Letters: B, O, R, N, E? 
- ""BYRNE"": B Y R N E? 
- ""PURNE""? Not a word? 
- ""HURNE""? Not? 
- ""MORNE""? M O R N E? Meaning sad? 
But is ""MORNE"" accepted? Let's see common wordle words? 
""TORNE"" not common? 
""LORNE"" proper? 
""YORNE"" not?

But ""BORNE"" is acceptable? And it has O? which is new? Not used before? 

Similarly, ""SYRNE"" not? 

Other options: none common? 

So we'll go with ""BORNE""? But let's check letters: we avoid C and A? And B and O are new? 

But why not ""GRONE""? Invalid? 

A better one: ""PRIDE"" not NE? No? 

So ""BORNE"" is a word? And must be with positions? 

In ""BORNE"": 
position 0: B
position 1: O
position 2: R
position 3: N
position 4: E

We know N and E are fixed? So this maintains them? Position 2 is R? which we are testing the possibility? And new letters B and O? 

If the secret word has R at position 0? Then guessing ""BORNE"" with R at position 2 might cause issues? But we're testing? The feedback will tell us?

Also, position 1: O? We haven't tested O? It could be present or not? 

Therefore, ""BORNE"" seems a good guess? 

Another word: ""SERNE"" not common? 

Or ""TERNE"" alloy? 

But ""BORNE"" is fine? 

Or we can use ""BYRNE"" with Y? Y is less common? So let's go with ""BORNE"". 

Now, we also have the option to test other common letters? Since B and O are common. 

But it's better than risking? 

So let's guess: borne

But first? Let's confirm from feedback? Also, note that in the first guess, we saw C is absent? A is absent? So with ""borne"", we'll get feedback on positions? 

So our second guess should be ""BORNE"". 

Thinking step by step? Format? Response.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is absent (x), so no C in the secret word.
- R is present but in the wrong position (-), so R must be in the secret word, but not at position 1. Since positions 3 and 4 are fixed as N and E (both ✓), R must be at either position 0 or position 2.
- A is absent (x), so no A in the secret word.
- N is correct and in position (✓), so position 3 must be N.
- E is correct and in position (✓), so position 4 must be E.

Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ N E, with R at position 0 or 2, and no C or A.

For the second guess:
- Choose a word that preserves the known correct positions (N at 3, E at 4) to avoid unnecessary changes.
- Test possible positions for R (position 0 or 2).
- Introduce new common letters to gather information on the first two positions.
- Avoid C and A, as they are absent.

A suitable guess is ""borne"":
- It has the required N and E at positions 3 and 4.
- It places R at position 2, testing one of the possible locations for R.
- It introduces new letters B and O? which are common and not ruled out yet.
- If R is indeed at position 2, we may get R as correct or wrong position. If not, it suggests R must be at position 0.
- B and O will provide new feedback.

This guess maximizes efficiency by confirming the position of R and exploring other common letters not yet tested.

<guess>borne</guess>",borne,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word has the letter 'N' in the 4th position and 'E' in the 5th position? Because 'N' is at index 3 and 'E' at index 4 in ""crane"".

Let me index the positions (0-indexed):
c r a n e
0 1 2 3 4

Feedback: 
position 0: C -> x (not in word)
position 1: R -> - (in word but wrong position)
position 2: A -> x (not in word)
position 3: N -> ✓ (correct, so N is in position 3)
position 4: E -> ✓ (correct, so E is in position 4)

Therefore, the secret word ends with ""NE"" and has the form: _ _ _ N E

Moreover, we know:
- The letter R is in the word, but not at position 1. So R must be in position 0 or 2? But wait, positions 0 and 2 are currently unknown, and we know position 0 can't have C (since C is not in the word) and position 2 can't have A (since A is not in the word).

Also, we know that the word does not contain C or A.

Now, since 'R' is present but not in position 1, it must be in one of the remaining positions: 0, 1, or 2? Wait, positions are fixed. Actually, the word has five positions: 0,1,2,3,4.

We have:
Position 3: N
Position 4: E

So R must appear in one of positions 0, 1, or 2? But note that position 1 is where we placed R and it was wrong, so R must be in either position 0 or position 2.

But position 2 had 'A' which is not in the word, so R cannot be at position 2? No, wait: the feedback for position 1 (R) was ""-"" meaning R is in the word but not at that position. So R is at position 0, position 2, or position 3? But position 3 is N and we have a check, so if R were at position 3, that would conflict because N is there. However, the word can have multiple letters? But in this case, the feedback doesn't indicate multiple same letters unless they are. However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

But note: the feedback for position 1: R is marked as present but wrong position. Since position 3 is fixed as N and position 4 as E, and they are correct, then R must be either at position 0 or position 2.

We also know that the word does not contain C and A.

So the secret word is: [?] [?] [?] N E

Now, the letter R must be at position 0 or 2? Because positions 1,3,4 are: we tried R at position 1 and it wasn't there, and positions 3 and 4 are taken by N and E.

So possible positions for R are 0 or 2? But position 2 we haven't placed R yet? Actually, position 2 we had A which is absent, so R could be there.

So constraints:
- The word must have R in position 0 or position 2? Or possibly in a duplicate position? But we don't know about duplicates.

Since we don't have any duplicate letters yet, we assume no duplicates for now? But we must consider.

Also, we must guess a new word that is a valid English word.

What letters do we know?
Must include R in position 0 or 2, and must have N and E at the end.

So pattern: either R _ _ N E  or  _ ? R ? N E? No: if R is at position 0, then the word is R ? ? N E. If R is at position 2, then the word is ? ? R N E.

But the middle position (2) could be R? Or position 0.

Also, we need to avoid C and A? Because both were absent.

Now, we have two known letters: R (somewhere) and N and E at the end? Actually N and E are fixed at positions 3 and 4.

So let's list possible words? That might be too many. Instead, we can choose a guess that tests the possibilities.

For the second guess, we want to get more information about the positions, especially the first three positions.

We know R must be at position 0 or position 2? Or possibly position 1? But wait, position 1 had R in the first guess and it was marked as wrong position? But no, the feedback said R is present but at wrong position? Meaning the R in position 1 is not correct? So R must be in position 0 or 2? Because positions 3 has N and 4 has E? And they are correct? So they can't be replaced.

But what about duplicate letters? If the word were ""RENNE"" or something, but we don't know? However, we should consider that.

But without evidence of duplicates, we can proceed assuming no duplicates for now? Because with no duplicate feedback, it's safer to assume distinct until proven otherwise.

So we'll assume the secret word has distinct letters? But let's not assume that? However, we can choose our next guess to have all distinct letters to maximize information.

Therefore, our next guess should:
1. Confirm the possible position of R: we can try putting R in position 0 or position 2? And also test other common letters that have not been ruled out.

2. Avoid letters we know are absent (C and A).

3. Include N and E at positions 3 and 4? Well, in the feedback, we know N and E are correct at positions 3 and 4? So we should keep them the same? Because if we change them? The rules: each guess must be a valid word. And to confirm or get more information, if we don't fix N and E, we might lose that info? But since we know they are fixed and correct? We can preserve them? Because if we change, we might get wrong feedback? But actually, we already know N and E are in position? So if we change, we'll get incorrect feedback? Which is bad? Because we can save those positions and focus on the others.

Therefore, it's best to keep positions 3 and 4 as N and E in our next guess? Because they are correct? That way, we don't use extra guesses on known positions? And focus on the unknown positions? But is that required? It's not required? But if I change them, then if I put E in another position, I might confuse myself? But let me see.

Actually, the feedback will tell us per position? So if I change position 3 and 4? Then if I put a different letter at position 3? It might show I was wrong? But we know N and E are fixed? So I should keep them? Because if I don't, I risk losing that information? Moreover, having two letters fixed means we only have three letters to guess.

So for positions 3 and 4, we will always use N and E? Because they are fixed? So the next guess should have the form: ? ? ? N E

Now, we need to fill in the first three characters? We know R must be in the word, but not in position 1? So since positions 0,1,2 must contain R? And positions 3 and 4 are fixed? So effectively, position 1 cannot have R? Because we tried R at position 1 and it said present but wrong? And since position 3 is N? And we have fixed positions? So R must be at position 0 or position 2.

Therefore, in our next guess, we want to test:

Either put R at position 0 or position 2? And test other letters? But we can do that? But we also need to test possible letters for the other positions.

Since we have three positions to fill: 0,1,2? And one of them must be R? But we don't know which? And the other two must be letters that are not C or A? And probably other common letters.

A good strategy: we can choose to put R at position 0? For example, ""R _ _ N E"", but we need a valid word? Then we can test another letter? Or we can put R at position 2? Like ""? ? R N E""

But in either case, we have to guess a word? And it should maximize information? If we fix R at position 0, then if it is correct, we get a green? If not, then we know R must be at position 2? But then we lose an opportunity to test other letters? Alternatively, we can avoid placing R in either position? But we must include R? Because we know R is in the word? So wherever we put it? But we don't know where? But if we put it in a new position? For example, if we put R at position 0? Then we get feedback: if R is at position 0? Then ✓, else if? Then we know? Or if we put it at position 2? Similarly?

Since we must include R? And we must not put it at position 1? Because that was already tried? So either 0 or 2? The two possibilities? We can't avoid? So why not test one? For example, let's assume R is at position 0 and guess a word with R at 0? And then see feedback? But that might not be efficient? We can choose a word that has R at position 2? So we can narrow down? Or choose a word that has multiple possibilities tested? But with three positions to guess? We might need to guess more? And we have limited letters to test? So we can choose a word that contains common letters? That haven't been tried? And also either R at 0 or R at 2.

But we have to avoid C and A? Because they are not in the word? So excluding C and A? And also, we know the word has no C or A? So we can use other vowels? But note: position 2? If R is not at 2? Could be another letter? Or position 0? Even position 1? Position 1: we don't know what it is? But we tried with R? But it doesn't have to be R? However, we must have R in the word? So R must be at 0 or 2.

Let me list possible letters? But without knowing the dictionary? It's hard? Instead, let's think of common words ending with ""NE""? And that include R? With no C or A.

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y

But since we must include R? And either at start or middle.

Common words? Like ""PRONE"", ""TRINE"", ""DRONE"", ""GRONE"" (invalid)? Or ""BRINE"", etc.

But to maximize information, we can choose a word that has unique letters? And from the common set.

For example, ""PRONE"": 
- P new letter? R at position 1? But wait? In our guess pattern, we have positions: 0,1,2,3,4? with 3 and 4 fixed as N and E? So if we guess ""PRONE"", then positions: 
P at 0, R at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4.

But note: position 1 is R? But in the first feedback, R was marked as present but wrong position? When we had crane: R at position 1 was marked ""-"" meaning R is in the word but not at position 1? So if we put R at position 1 again? It might mark wrong position again? Or if it were position 1? Then it would be green? But it can't be? Because we were told it's not at position 1? So we shouldn't put R at position 1 again? Because we know it's incorrect? And putting it again? We might get ""-"" again? Which gives no new information.

Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 1? For the next guess? So we cannot use a word with R at position 1? Because it will be wrong? And we already know that? So ""PRONE"" has R at position 1? Which we know is wrong? So we don't need to test it? And it wastes a position? So we should not choose a word with R at position 1? Because we know it's incorrect? And that letter position needs testing? So we should put R at position 0 or position 2.

Positions to fill: 0,1,2? We can put:
Option 1: R at position 0? Then word: R ? ? N E? Or
Option 2: ? ? R N E

Now, what words are there?
For ""R ? ? N E"": common words: R?INE? But I is vowel? But also, ""ROUND"" doesn't end with NE? ""RANGE"" has A and we know A is absent? ""RICED""? But that has common letters? Possible words for ""R ? ? N E"": 
- ROUTE? But T and U? But ""ROUTE"" ends with TE? Not NE? 
Can you think of words? ""RINS E"" -> wait? ""RINSE"" has S? But ""RINSE"" ends with SE? Not NE? 
""ROBIN E""? Not? None? Perhaps ""RIPEN""? But that's R I P E N? Positions: R at 0, I at 1, P at 2, E at 3, N at 4? But we need N at 3 and E at 4? So ""RIPEN"" has E at 3 and N at 4? Which is wrong? We need position 3: N? Position 4: E? So it must be R?x?N E? 

Let me find words that end with ""NE"": which have an N? Then E? So consonant?N?E? So it might be vowel?N?E? Or consonant? But ""? N E""? So the word ends with ""NE"", like ""AISNE"" not common? Possible words: BRINE, TRINE, PRUNE, CRONE? But C and A? Avoid C? CRONE has C? Which we know is absent? 
Words ending with NE: include IRENE? Too short? ""UNION"" doesn't? Let's think common five-letter words: 
BRINE? B-R-I-N-E? but A and C are out? No C? 
BRINE: B, R, I, N, E? and B is new? 
But if we do R? ? N E? If we put BRINE? Then position 0 is B, position 1 is R? But we cannot have R at position 1? Because we know it's wrong? So BRINE has R at position 1? Which we must avoid.

If we want position 0: R and position 1: not R? Position 2: something? 
Word: ""ROU N E""? Not? ""R"" + something? ""ROME""? not NE? 
""RANDE""? But A? and not? 
""RANGE"" has A? 
""RONDO""? not? 

Perhaps ""R? N E"" with two letters? There might not be common English words? 
What about ""TRINE"": T-R-I-N-E? Here, position 1 is R? Which is forbidden? 
Or ""DRONE"": D-R-O-N-E? Again R at position 1? 
""PRONE"": P-R-O-N-E? R at position 1? 
Many end with ""NE"" have the vowel? But we need a word with R at position 0? Which is rare? 
Alternatively, no R at start? Then put R at position 2: word pattern ? ? R N E? 
Then we can have: ? ? R N E? e.g., ""BAR N E""? But we know A is bad? ""CORED""? not NE? 
Possible: ""HORN E"" -> ""HORNE"" is a surname? Or ""borne""? B-O-R-N-E? which has O? and B? 
""B O R N E"": positions: B at 0, O at 1, R at 2, N at 3, E at 4? Perfect? So ""BORNE"" 
""P O R N E"" -> porny? not? ""PORNE"" not word? 
""L O R N E"" -> surname? 
""S O R N E"" -> not common? 
But ""BORNE"" is a word? Meaning carried? 
""BORNE"" has O? 
We can also have ""BYRNE""? B-Y-R-N-E? positions: B at 0, Y at 1, R at 2, N at 3, E at 4? But Y at position 1? And it's valid? 

So possible words for pattern ? ? R N E: with R at position2: BORNE, BYRNE, CORNE (not? Cornea, but 6 letters?), but we avoid C? 
HOR? HORNE is not five? Horn, 4?
""DIR N E"" -> DIRNE not word? 
""WORN E"" -> WORNE archaic? 
Maybe ""TIRESOME"" no? 
Common words: ""URINE"" has U at 0, R at 1? But position 1 is R which we must avoid? 
""CARNE"" has C and A? 
""PER? PERNE"" not common? 
So viable options: ""BORNE"" or ""BYRNE""? 

""BORNE"" is more common?

Or ""MIN R E"" -> MINRE not a word? 
""LINED""? not R? 

Another idea: ""GRIM E N"" no? We need exact? 

Since R can be at position 0? But hard to find words? Let's try: R?x?N E? 
""RES? RESIN"" but ends with IN? not NE? ""RESEN""? not word? 
""RIPEN"" -> R-I-P-E-N, but E at 3? Not NE? 
""RISEN"" -> R-I-S-E-N? Then E at 3? 
To have N at position 3? So ""R I S N E""? ""RISNE"" not a word? 
""R E I N E"" -> ""REINE"" is French? Not common? 
""R U N E S? 5:? ""RUNES"" but E at 4? And N at 3? So ""R U N E S"" has N at 3 and E at 4? RUNES: R U N E S? Position 0: R? Position 1: U? Position 2: N? Position 3: E? Position 4: S? But in our, position 3 must be N? And position 4 E? So not RUNES? 
Do any words start with R and end with NE? Common? ""RAIN E""? Has A? ""RENT E""? Not 5? 
 ""RANCE"" has C? 
 Very hard? Maybe ""RHYME""? But ends with ME? 
 ""ROGUE""? 
 It seems there are the best words with R at position 2?

Therefore, better to put R at position 2? And choose a word with that pattern.

So pattern: _ _ R N E? So positions 0 and 1 need letters? Not C or A? And common.

Possible words:
- ""BORNE"": B O R N E? Letters: B, O, R, N, E? 
- ""BYRNE"": B Y R N E? 
- ""PURNE""? Not a word? 
- ""HURNE""? Not? 
- ""MORNE""? M O R N E? Meaning sad? 
But is ""MORNE"" accepted? Let's see common wordle words? 
""TORNE"" not common? 
""LORNE"" proper? 
""YORNE"" not?

But ""BORNE"" is acceptable? And it has O? which is new? Not used before? 

Similarly, ""SYRNE"" not? 

Other options: none common? 

So we'll go with ""BORNE""? But let's check letters: we avoid C and A? And B and O are new? 

But why not ""GRONE""? Invalid? 

A better one: ""PRIDE"" not NE? No? 

So ""BORNE"" is a word? And must be with positions? 

In ""BORNE"": 
position 0: B
position 1: O
position 2: R
position 3: N
position 4: E

We know N and E are fixed? So this maintains them? Position 2 is R? which we are testing the possibility? And new letters B and O? 

If the secret word has R at position 0? Then guessing ""BORNE"" with R at position 2 might cause issues? But we're testing? The feedback will tell us?

Also, position 1: O? We haven't tested O? It could be present or not? 

Therefore, ""BORNE"" seems a good guess? 

Another word: ""SERNE"" not common? 

Or ""TERNE"" alloy? 

But ""BORNE"" is fine? 

Or we can use ""BYRNE"" with Y? Y is less common? So let's go with ""BORNE"". 

Now, we also have the option to test other common letters? Since B and O are common. 

But it's better than risking? 

So let's guess: borne

But first? Let's confirm from feedback? Also, note that in the first guess, we saw C is absent? A is absent? So with ""borne"", we'll get feedback on positions? 

So our second guess should be ""BORNE"". 

Thinking step by step? Format? Response.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is absent (x), so no C in the secret word.
- R is present but in the wrong position (-), so R must be in the secret word, but not at position 1. Since positions 3 and 4 are fixed as N and E (both ✓), R must be at either position 0 or position 2.
- A is absent (x), so no A in the secret word.
- N is correct and in position (✓), so position 3 must be N.
- E is correct and in position (✓), so position 4 must be E.

Therefore, the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ N E, with R at position 0 or 2, and no C or A.

For the second guess:
- Choose a word that preserves the known correct positions (N at 3, E at 4) to avoid unnecessary changes.
- Test possible positions for R (position 0 or 2).
- Introduce new common letters to gather information on the first two positions.
- Avoid C and A, as they are absent.

A suitable guess is ""borne"":
- It has the required N and E at positions 3 and 4.
- It places R at position 2, testing one of the possible locations for R.
- It introduces new letters B and O? which are common and not ruled out yet.
- If R is indeed at position 2, we may get R as correct or wrong position. If not, it suggests R must be at position 0.
- B and O will provide new feedback.

This guess maximizes efficiency by confirming the position of R and exploring other common letters not yet tested.",Guess 2: borne -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) O(✓) R(✓) N(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
