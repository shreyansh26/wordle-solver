First, the feedback for my first guess ""crane"" is: C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-). This means:

- C is in the word but not in the correct position (since it's marked with -).
- R is not in the word at all (marked with x).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the correct position (marked with -).

So, from this, I know that the secret word contains C and E, but not in the positions I guessed. Specifically:

- C was in position 1 of my guess, but it's not correct there. So in the secret word, C is not in position 1.
- E was in position 5, but it's not correct there, so E is not in position 5.
- R, A, and N are completely absent from the secret word.

Letters not in the word: R, A, N.

Letters that are in the word: C and E.

Now, I need to make a second guess. My new word must:
- Be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Include C and E since they are part of the secret word.
- Not include R, A, or N.
- Position C and E in positions different from 1 and 5, respectively, since those positions were incorrect for them.

C can't be in position 1, and E can't be in position 5.

Also, since C and E are present but misplaced, I should try them in new positions.

I need to think of words that contain C and E, and exclude R, A, N.

Common consonants to consider: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But vowels: E is already included, so I might need other vowels like I, O, U (since A is out).

Since E is in the word, and C, other letters could be common ones.

A good approach is to use a word that tests new letters while placing C and E in different positions.

Let me list some words that have C and E, and don't have R, A, N.

For example:
- PIECE: But P, I, E, C. E is at the end, but in position 5 for ""crane"" was wrong, so position 5 is bad for E. ""piece"" has E in position 5, which might be invalid if E can't be in position 5? The feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in position 4 or something else, but in a new word, I should avoid position 5 for E.

Similarly, C is not in position 1, so in a new word, C should not be in position 1.

So for my second guess, I need C not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

Possible words:
- How about ""SPICE"": S, P, I, C, E. C is in position 4, E in position 5. But E is in position 5, and the feedback said E is not in position 5, so I shouldn't put E in position 5 again. Putting E in position 5 might be wasteful because I know it's wrong, but I could still guess it to confirm or get more info, but ideally, I should place it in a new position to get positional information.

Similarly for C.

In ""SPICE"", C is in position 4, which is new (was position 1 before), and E is in position 5, which is known wrong, so not good.

Better to have E in a different position.

Another word: ""THIEF"" – but no C, I need C.

Word with C and E.

""DECOY"" – D, E, C, O, Y. That might work.
- Positions: E in position 2, C in position 3, neither position 1 nor 5.
- Letters: D, E, C, O, Y. None of R, A, N.

But O and Y are new.

""MEDIC"" – M, E, D, I, C. E in position 2, C in position 5. Position 5 for C? C was not position 1, but position 5 might be ok for C since we don't know about position 5 yet for C. Only E was misplaced in position 5, C was misplaced in position 1.

For E, position 5 is bad; for C, any position except 1 could be possible.

In ""medic"", E is position 2 (good), C is position 5. But E is in position 2, which was not the position previously, but the secret word might have E in position 2.

C at position 5: could be possible.

Letters: M, E, D, I, C. R, A, N absent – good.

What about ""CLIME""? C is at position 1 again, which is bad because C cannot be in position 1. So avoid C in position 1.

""SCENE"": C in position 2? S, C, E, N, E. But N is in it – N is not in the word, since from feedback, N is absent. So ""scene"" has N, which is eliminated; can't use.

""PIECE"" has E at end position, and P and I.

But E at position 5 is bad.

So better options.

Let's think of words with E not in position 5.

For example, ""HONEY"" but has N, no.

""COULD"" – C, O, U, L, D. But E is needed? E must be in the word, so I have to include E.

Words that must contain C and E.

Possible words, with C not in 1, E not in 5.

Option: ""PRICE"" – P, R, I, C, E. But R is in it, and R is eliminated – no, feedback said R(x), meaning R not in word, so can't have R.

Important: exclude R, A, N.

In ""price"", it has R, so invalid.

""SPICE"" – S, P, I, C, E. Letters: S, P, I, C, E. S, P, I are new, C in position 4, E in position 5.

E in position 5 – but I know position 5 is wrong for E, so this might not be efficient. I could use it to confirm other letters.

Perhaps I should choose a word where I can place E in a middle position.

Another word: ""ELECT"" – E, L, E, C, T. E in position 1 and position 4; C in position 5? Positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:E, 4:C, 5:T. E in position 1 and 3, but position 1 might be ok? Only C was position 1 issue; E wasn't in position 1 before.

In first guess ""crane"", E was position 5, not position 1. So position 1 could be possible for E or other letters.

But C cannot be position 1.

In ""elect"", E in position 1, L, E in position 3, C in position 4, T in position 5.

C is in position 4, which is new and not position 1, good.

E is in position 1 and 3; position 5 is avoided.

Also, no R, A, N; letters are E, L, C, T.

But it has E twice. Is that allowed? The secret word might have repeated letters, but the feedback doesn't indicate that here.

Whether to repeat letters or not, it might be inefficient, but possible.

Another word: ""CLEAR"" – but C in position 1, bad, and R and A are out.

No.

""SCENT"" – S, C, E, N, T. But N is in it, eliminated.

No N.

Possible words: let's list: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z; vowels I, O, U can be used.

Words with C and E: e.g., ""PIECE"", but E at end.

""CEDES"" – C in position 1? Bad.

""DEUCE"" – D, E, U, C, E. Positions: E in position 2 and 5; position 5 is bad, and C in position 4.

But E in position 2 and 5; position 5 invalid.

""EXCEL"" – E, X, C, E, L. E in position 1 and 4; C in position 3. Good: C not in 1, E not in 5? E is in position 1 and 4, position 5 avoid.

""EXCEL"" is 5 letters: E, X, C, E, L. Positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:C, 4:E, 5:L.

So E in position 1 and position 4. Position 5 is L, not E.

From feedback, E is in the word but not position 5, so position 1 for E could be possible, position 4 for E could be possible.

C in position 3, not position 1, good.

Letters: E, X, C, E, L – E repeated, X and L new.

No R, A, N.

""EXCEL"" could work.

Another word: ""SCALE"" – S, C, A, L, E – but A is eliminated, can't.

""TOPIC"" – T, O, P, I, C – no E, not good.

Must have E.

""CELLO"" – C, E, L, L, O – C in position 1, bad.

Perhaps ""MINCE"" – M, I, N, C, E – N is in it, eliminated.

No N.

So ""EXCEL"" seems decent.

Other options: ""CLOUD"" no E.

""HOUSE"" no C.

""SPICE"" as I thought earlier: S, P, I, C, E. Positions: S1, P2, I3, C4, E5. C in position 4, good; E in position 5, which is known wrong. If I guess E in position 5, and it's wrong, I get x for E if it's not there, but I know E is in the word, so it should be - if position is wrong or ✓ if correct. But since position 5 is wrong (based on first feedback), I'll likely get - again, which doesn't give new info. Whereas if I place E in a new position, I might get more.

For example, if E in position 5 is wrong, putting it there gives me - and tells me it's still wrong, but I might not learn the correct position.

Whereas putting E in position 1, for example, I could get - or ✓.

Similarly for other positions.

So better to place E in a position not tested before, like position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Position 4 was not tested in ""crane""; positions tested were C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5).

So positions tested: position 1,2,3,4,5, but with specific letters.

Now, position 1 had C which is wrong; position 2 had R not present; position 3 had A not present; position 4 had N not present; position 5 had E wrong position.

For new word, I should try C in positions 2,3,4 or 5; E in positions 1,2,3 or 4.

Position 4 for C? In first guess, position 4 was N, not C.

Perhaps ""SPIEL"" no C.

Word: ""OUNCE"" – O, U, N, C, E – N in it, no.

""FORCE"" – F, O, R, C, E – R in it, no.

""TWICE"" – T, W, I, C, E. Positions: T1, W2, I3, C4, E5. C position 4, E position 5. Again E at end.

""BELIE"" no C.

""MEDIC"" as before: M, E, D, I, C. Positions: M1, E2, D3, I4, C5. E in position 2, C in position 5. Position 2 for E: not tested before; position 5 for C: not tested.

Good. And E not in 5, C not in 1. Position 5 for C might be fine.

Letters: M, E, D, I, C. All new except E and C, and E at position 2, C at position 5.

No R, A, N.

""MEDIC"" seems like a good guess.

""DEVICE"" too long.

""EPOCH"" – E, P, O, C, H. Positions: E1, P2, O3, C4, H5. E in position 1, C in position 4. Both C and E in new positions. Position 1 for E? Not tested; position 4 for C, not tested.

Letters: E, P, O, C, H. New letters P, O, H.

Also good.

Between ""MEDIC"" and ""EPOCH"", ""medic"" places E in position 2 and C in position 5, while ""epoch"" places E in position 1 and C in position 4.

Position 2 was previously R, not present, so any letter ok.

Similarly, position 5 for C could be ok.

I think both are valid.

Another word: ""CHOSE"" – C in position 1, bad.

Avoid C in position 1.

""SPACE"" – S, P, A, C, E – A present, eliminated.

No.

""CRUET"" – C in position 1, R present, bad.

Perhaps ""TOPEC"" not a word.

I think ""medic"" or ""epoch"" are fine.

Let me choose ""medic"" for now.

""medic"" – M at position 1, which is new; E at position 2, which was R's position but R not in word, so E could be there; D at position 3; I at position 4; C at position 5.

Good.

So I'll go with ""medic"".

But earlier I thought about ""EXCEL"" – E at position 1, which is new position.

In ""crane"", position 1 was C wrong, but position 1 could be E or other.

For example, E in position 1: if correct, I get ✓; if wrong, I get - or x, but since E is in word, if position 1 is E, ✓; if not, probably - implying E is elsewhere.

Similarly.

But ""medic"" tests position 2 and 5.

I think it's fine.

To avoid E in position 5, but in ""medic"" E is in position 2, C in position 5.

Position 5 is fine for C.

Similarly, in ""epoch"", E in position 1, C in position 4.

Both ok.

I'll choose ""MEDIC"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C is present but not in position 1 (marked with -), so C must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked with -), so E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- R, A, and N are absent from the word (marked with x), so they cannot be in the new guess.
- The new guess must include C and E, and exclude R, A, N, while placing C not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

A good second guess should:
- Test C and E in new positions not ruled out.
- Introduce new letters to gain more information.
- Avoid placing E in position 5 (known incorrect) and C in position 1 (known incorrect).

After considering possible words, ""medic"" is a valid choice:
- Positions: M (position 1), E (position 2), D (position 3), I (position 4), C (position 5).
- C is placed in position 5 (new position, not position 1).
- E is placed in position 2 (new position, not position 5).
- Includes new letters M, D, I to test.
- Excludes R, A, N as required.

<guess>medic</guess>",medic,"First, the feedback for my first guess ""crane"" is: C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-). This means:

- E is in the word but not in the correct position (marked with -).

""EXCEL"" is 5 letters: E, X, C, E, L. Positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:C, 4:E, 5:L.

So E in position 1 and position 4. Position 5 is L, not E.

From feedback, E is in the word but not position 5, so position 1 for E could be possible, position 4 for E could be possible.

C in position 3, not position 1, good.

Letters: E, X, C, E, L – E repeated, X and L new.

No R, A, N.

""EXCEL"" could work.

Another word: ""SCALE"" – S, C, A, L, E – but A is eliminated, can't.

""TOPIC"" – T, O, P, I, C – no E, not good.

Must have E.

""CELLO"" – C, E, L, L, O – C in position 1, bad.

Perhaps ""MINCE"" – M, I, N, C, E – N is in it, eliminated.

No N.

So ""EXCEL"" seems decent.

Other options: ""CLOUD"" no E.

""HOUSE"" no C.

""SPICE"" as I thought earlier: S, P, I, C, E. Positions: S1, P2, I3, C4, E5. C in position 4, good; E in position 5, which is known wrong. If I guess E in position 5, and it's wrong, I get x for E if it's not there, but I know E is in the word, so it should be - if position is wrong or ✓ if correct. But since position 5 is wrong (based on first feedback), I'll likely get - again, which doesn't give new info. Whereas if I place E in a new position, I might get more.

For example, if E in position 5 is wrong, putting it there gives me - and tells me it's still wrong, but I might not learn the correct position.

Whereas putting E in position 1, for example, I could get - or ✓.

Similarly for other positions.

So better to place E in a position not tested before, like position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Position 4 was not tested in ""crane""; positions tested were C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5).

So positions tested: position 1,2,3,4,5, but with specific letters.

Now, position 1 had C which is wrong; position 2 had R not present; position 3 had A not present; position 4 had N not present; position 5 had E wrong position.

For new word, I should try C in positions 2,3,4 or 5; E in positions 1,2,3 or 4.

Position 4 for C? In first guess, position 4 was N, not C.

Perhaps ""SPIEL"" no C.

Word: ""OUNCE"" – O, U, N, C, E – N in it, no.

""FORCE"" – F, O, R, C, E – R in it, no.

""TWICE"" – T, W, I, C, E. Positions: T1, W2, I3, C4, E5. C position 4, E position 5. Again E at end.

""BELIE"" no C.

""MEDIC"" as before: M, E, D, I, C. Positions: M1, E2, D3, I4, C5. E in position 2, C in position 5. Position 2 for E: not tested before; position 5 for C: not tested.

Good. And E not in 5, C not in 1. Position 5 for C might be fine.

Letters: M, E, D, I, C. All new except E and C, and E at position 2, C at position 5.

No R, A, N.

""MEDIC"" seems like a good guess.

""DEVICE"" too long.

""EPOCH"" – E, P, O, C, H. Positions: E1, P2, O3, C4, H5. E in position 1, C in position 4. Both C and E in new positions. Position 1 for E? Not tested; position 4 for C, not tested.

Letters: E, P, O, C, H. New letters P, O, H.

Also good.

Between ""MEDIC"" and ""EPOCH"", ""medic"" places E in position 2 and C in position 5, while ""epoch"" places E in position 1 and C in position 4.

Position 2 was previously R, not present, so any letter ok.

Similarly, position 5 for C could be ok.

I think both are valid.

Another word: ""CHOSE"" – C in position 1, bad.

Avoid C in position 1.

""SPACE"" – S, P, A, C, E – A present, eliminated.

No.

""CRUET"" – C in position 1, R present, bad.

Perhaps ""TOPEC"" not a word.

I think ""medic"" or ""epoch"" are fine.

Let me choose ""medic"" for now.

""medic"" – M at position 1, which is new; E at position 2, which was R's position but R not in word, so E could be there; D at position 3; I at position 4; C at position 5.

Good.

So I'll go with ""medic"".

But earlier I thought about ""EXCEL"" – E at position 1, which is new position.

In ""crane"", position 1 was C wrong, but position 1 could be E or other.

For example, E in position 1: if correct, I get ✓; if wrong, I get - or x, but since E is in word, if position 1 is E, ✓; if not, probably - implying E is elsewhere.

Similarly.

But ""medic"" tests position 2 and 5.

I think it's fine.

To avoid E in position 5, but in ""medic"" E is in position 2, C in position 5.

Position 5 is fine for C.

Similarly, in ""epoch"", E in position 1, C in position 4.

Both ok.

I'll choose ""MEDIC"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C is present but not in position 1 (marked with -), so C must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked with -), so E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- R, A, and N are absent from the word (marked with x), so they cannot be in the new guess.
- The new guess must include C and E, and exclude R, A, N, while placing C not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

A good second guess should:
- Test C and E in new positions not ruled out.
- Introduce new letters to gain more information.
- Avoid placing E in position 5 (known incorrect) and C in position 1 (known incorrect).

After considering possible words, ""medic"" is a valid choice:
- Positions: M (position 1), E (position 2), D (position 3), I (position 4), C (position 5).
- C is placed in position 5 (new position, not position 1).
- E is placed in position 2 (new position, not position 5).
- Includes new letters M, D, I to test.
- Excludes R, A, N as required.",Guess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) D(x) I(x) C(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,speck,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the feedback for my first guess ""crane"" is: C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-). This means:

- C is in the word but not in the correct position (since it's marked with -).
- R is not in the word at all (marked with x).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the correct position (marked with -).

So, from this, I know that the secret word contains C and E, but not in the positions I guessed. Specifically:

- C was in position 1 of my guess, but it's not correct there. So in the secret word, C is not in position 1.
- E was in position 5, but it's not correct there, so E is not in position 5.
- R, A, and N are completely absent from the secret word.

Letters not in the word: R, A, N.

Letters that are in the word: C and E.

Now, I need to make a second guess. My new word must:
- Be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Include C and E since they are part of the secret word.
- Not include R, A, or N.
- Position C and E in positions different from 1 and 5, respectively, since those positions were incorrect for them.

C can't be in position 1, and E can't be in position 5.

Also, since C and E are present but misplaced, I should try them in new positions.

I need to think of words that contain C and E, and exclude R, A, N.

Common consonants to consider: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But vowels: E is already included, so I might need other vowels like I, O, U (since A is out).

Since E is in the word, and C, other letters could be common ones.

A good approach is to use a word that tests new letters while placing C and E in different positions.

Let me list some words that have C and E, and don't have R, A, N.

For example:
- PIECE: But P, I, E, C. E is at the end, but in position 5 for ""crane"" was wrong, so position 5 is bad for E. ""piece"" has E in position 5, which might be invalid if E can't be in position 5? The feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in position 4 or something else, but in a new word, I should avoid position 5 for E.

Similarly, C is not in position 1, so in a new word, C should not be in position 1.

So for my second guess, I need C not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

Possible words:
- How about ""SPICE"": S, P, I, C, E. C is in position 4, E in position 5. But E is in position 5, and the feedback said E is not in position 5, so I shouldn't put E in position 5 again. Putting E in position 5 might be wasteful because I know it's wrong, but I could still guess it to confirm or get more info, but ideally, I should place it in a new position to get positional information.

Similarly for C.

In ""SPICE"", C is in position 4, which is new (was position 1 before), and E is in position 5, which is known wrong, so not good.

Better to have E in a different position.

Another word: ""THIEF"" – but no C, I need C.

Word with C and E.

""DECOY"" – D, E, C, O, Y. That might work.
- Positions: E in position 2, C in position 3, neither position 1 nor 5.
- Letters: D, E, C, O, Y. None of R, A, N.

But O and Y are new.

""MEDIC"" – M, E, D, I, C. E in position 2, C in position 5. Position 5 for C? C was not position 1, but position 5 might be ok for C since we don't know about position 5 yet for C. Only E was misplaced in position 5, C was misplaced in position 1.

For E, position 5 is bad; for C, any position except 1 could be possible.

In ""medic"", E is position 2 (good), C is position 5. But E is in position 2, which was not the position previously, but the secret word might have E in position 2.

C at position 5: could be possible.

Letters: M, E, D, I, C. R, A, N absent – good.

What about ""CLIME""? C is at position 1 again, which is bad because C cannot be in position 1. So avoid C in position 1.

""SCENE"": C in position 2? S, C, E, N, E. But N is in it – N is not in the word, since from feedback, N is absent. So ""scene"" has N, which is eliminated; can't use.

""PIECE"" has E at end position, and P and I.

But E at position 5 is bad.

So better options.

Let's think of words with E not in position 5.

For example, ""HONEY"" but has N, no.

""COULD"" – C, O, U, L, D. But E is needed? E must be in the word, so I have to include E.

Words that must contain C and E.

Possible words, with C not in 1, E not in 5.

Option: ""PRICE"" – P, R, I, C, E. But R is in it, and R is eliminated – no, feedback said R(x), meaning R not in word, so can't have R.

Important: exclude R, A, N.

In ""price"", it has R, so invalid.

""SPICE"" – S, P, I, C, E. Letters: S, P, I, C, E. S, P, I are new, C in position 4, E in position 5.

E in position 5 – but I know position 5 is wrong for E, so this might not be efficient. I could use it to confirm other letters.

Perhaps I should choose a word where I can place E in a middle position.

Another word: ""ELECT"" – E, L, E, C, T. E in position 1 and position 4; C in position 5? Positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:E, 4:C, 5:T. E in position 1 and 3, but position 1 might be ok? Only C was position 1 issue; E wasn't in position 1 before.

In first guess ""crane"", E was position 5, not position 1. So position 1 could be possible for E or other letters.

But C cannot be position 1.

In ""elect"", E in position 1, L, E in position 3, C in position 4, T in position 5.

C is in position 4, which is new and not position 1, good.

E is in position 1 and 3; position 5 is avoided.

Also, no R, A, N; letters are E, L, C, T.

But it has E twice. Is that allowed? The secret word might have repeated letters, but the feedback doesn't indicate that here.

Whether to repeat letters or not, it might be inefficient, but possible.

Another word: ""CLEAR"" – but C in position 1, bad, and R and A are out.

No.

""SCENT"" – S, C, E, N, T. But N is in it, eliminated.

No N.

Possible words: let's list: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z; vowels I, O, U can be used.

Words with C and E: e.g., ""PIECE"", but E at end.

""CEDES"" – C in position 1? Bad.

""DEUCE"" – D, E, U, C, E. Positions: E in position 2 and 5; position 5 is bad, and C in position 4.

But E in position 2 and 5; position 5 invalid.

""EXCEL"" – E, X, C, E, L. E in position 1 and 4; C in position 3. Good: C not in 1, E not in 5? E is in position 1 and 4, position 5 avoid.

""EXCEL"" is 5 letters: E, X, C, E, L. Positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:C, 4:E, 5:L.

So E in position 1 and position 4. Position 5 is L, not E.

From feedback, E is in the word but not position 5, so position 1 for E could be possible, position 4 for E could be possible.

C in position 3, not position 1, good.

Letters: E, X, C, E, L – E repeated, X and L new.

No R, A, N.

""EXCEL"" could work.

Another word: ""SCALE"" – S, C, A, L, E – but A is eliminated, can't.

""TOPIC"" – T, O, P, I, C – no E, not good.

Must have E.

""CELLO"" – C, E, L, L, O – C in position 1, bad.

Perhaps ""MINCE"" – M, I, N, C, E – N is in it, eliminated.

No N.

So ""EXCEL"" seems decent.

Other options: ""CLOUD"" no E.

""HOUSE"" no C.

""SPICE"" as I thought earlier: S, P, I, C, E. Positions: S1, P2, I3, C4, E5. C in position 4, good; E in position 5, which is known wrong. If I guess E in position 5, and it's wrong, I get x for E if it's not there, but I know E is in the word, so it should be - if position is wrong or ✓ if correct. But since position 5 is wrong (based on first feedback), I'll likely get - again, which doesn't give new info. Whereas if I place E in a new position, I might get more.

For example, if E in position 5 is wrong, putting it there gives me - and tells me it's still wrong, but I might not learn the correct position.

Whereas putting E in position 1, for example, I could get - or ✓.

Similarly for other positions.

So better to place E in a position not tested before, like position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Position 4 was not tested in ""crane""; positions tested were C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5).

So positions tested: position 1,2,3,4,5, but with specific letters.

Now, position 1 had C which is wrong; position 2 had R not present; position 3 had A not present; position 4 had N not present; position 5 had E wrong position.

For new word, I should try C in positions 2,3,4 or 5; E in positions 1,2,3 or 4.

Position 4 for C? In first guess, position 4 was N, not C.

Perhaps ""SPIEL"" no C.

Word: ""OUNCE"" – O, U, N, C, E – N in it, no.

""FORCE"" – F, O, R, C, E – R in it, no.

""TWICE"" – T, W, I, C, E. Positions: T1, W2, I3, C4, E5. C position 4, E position 5. Again E at end.

""BELIE"" no C.

""MEDIC"" as before: M, E, D, I, C. Positions: M1, E2, D3, I4, C5. E in position 2, C in position 5. Position 2 for E: not tested before; position 5 for C: not tested.

Good. And E not in 5, C not in 1. Position 5 for C might be fine.

Letters: M, E, D, I, C. All new except E and C, and E at position 2, C at position 5.

No R, A, N.

""MEDIC"" seems like a good guess.

""DEVICE"" too long.

""EPOCH"" – E, P, O, C, H. Positions: E1, P2, O3, C4, H5. E in position 1, C in position 4. Both C and E in new positions. Position 1 for E? Not tested; position 4 for C, not tested.

Letters: E, P, O, C, H. New letters P, O, H.

Also good.

Between ""MEDIC"" and ""EPOCH"", ""medic"" places E in position 2 and C in position 5, while ""epoch"" places E in position 1 and C in position 4.

Position 2 was previously R, not present, so any letter ok.

Similarly, position 5 for C could be ok.

I think both are valid.

Another word: ""CHOSE"" – C in position 1, bad.

Avoid C in position 1.

""SPACE"" – S, P, A, C, E – A present, eliminated.

No.

""CRUET"" – C in position 1, R present, bad.

Perhaps ""TOPEC"" not a word.

I think ""medic"" or ""epoch"" are fine.

Let me choose ""medic"" for now.

""medic"" – M at position 1, which is new; E at position 2, which was R's position but R not in word, so E could be there; D at position 3; I at position 4; C at position 5.

Good.

So I'll go with ""medic"".

But earlier I thought about ""EXCEL"" – E at position 1, which is new position.

In ""crane"", position 1 was C wrong, but position 1 could be E or other.

For example, E in position 1: if correct, I get ✓; if wrong, I get - or x, but since E is in word, if position 1 is E, ✓; if not, probably - implying E is elsewhere.

Similarly.

But ""medic"" tests position 2 and 5.

I think it's fine.

To avoid E in position 5, but in ""medic"" E is in position 2, C in position 5.

Position 5 is fine for C.

Similarly, in ""epoch"", E in position 1, C in position 4.

Both ok.

I'll choose ""MEDIC"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C is present but not in position 1 (marked with -), so C must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked with -), so E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- R, A, and N are absent from the word (marked with x), so they cannot be in the new guess.
- The new guess must include C and E, and exclude R, A, N, while placing C not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

A good second guess should:
- Test C and E in new positions not ruled out.
- Introduce new letters to gain more information.
- Avoid placing E in position 5 (known incorrect) and C in position 1 (known incorrect).

After considering possible words, ""medic"" is a valid choice:
- Positions: M (position 1), E (position 2), D (position 3), I (position 4), C (position 5).
- C is placed in position 5 (new position, not position 1).
- E is placed in position 2 (new position, not position 5).
- Includes new letters M, D, I to test.
- Excludes R, A, N as required.

If I guess E in position 5, and it\'s wrong, I get x for E if it\'s not there, but I know E is in the word, so it should be - if position is wrong or ✓ if correct. But since position 5 is wrong (based on first feedback), I\'ll likely get - again, which doesn\'t give new info. Whereas if I place E in a new position, I might get more.\n\nFor example, if E in position 5 is wrong, putting it there gives me - and tells me it\'s still wrong, but I might not learn the correct position.\n\nWhereas putting E in position 1, for example, I could get - or ✓.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nSo better to place E in a position not tested before, like position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nPosition 4 was not tested in ""crane""; positions tested were C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5).\n\nSo positions tested: position 1,2,3,4,5, but with specific letters.\n\nNow, position 1 had C which is wrong; position 2 had R not present; position 3 had A not present; position 4 had N not present; position 5 had E wrong position.\n\nFor new word, I should try C in positions 2,3,4 or 5; E in positions 1,2,3 or 4.\n\nPosition 4 for C?

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""medic"" -> M(x), E(-), D(x), I(x), C(-)
Meaning:
- M is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (since it's marked -).
- D is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- C is in the word but not in position 5.

Now, combining the information:

Letters not in the word: R, A, N, M, D, I (from the x's)

Letters that are in the word: C and E (from both guesses, and they are confirmed present).

For C:
- From guess 1: not in position 1.
- From guess 2: not in position 5.
- So C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

For E:
- From guess 1: not in position 5.
- From guess 2: not in position 2.
- So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Also, the word has 5 letters, and we know only C and E are in the word so far (from the letters we've tested). But we have tested 10 unique letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, D, I. That leaves many letters untested.

We need to find a word that:
- Contains C and E.
- C is in position 2, 3, or 4.
- E is in position 1, 3, or 4.
- But note: positions 3 and 4 could be either C or E, but not both at the same time unless the word has duplicate letters? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but in Wordle, duplicates are possible.

However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate indications, so we should consider the possibility.

But for now, let's assume no duplicates until we see evidence.

So, possible positions:

- Position 1: could be E (since E can be in 1,3,4) or a new letter.
- Position 2: could be C (since C can be in 2,3,4) or a new letter, but not E (since E not in position 2).
- Position 3: could be C or E or a new letter.
- Position 4: could be C or E or a new letter.
- Position 5: cannot be E (from guess1) and cannot be C (from guess2), so must be a new letter.

Also, we must avoid the letters: R, A, N, M, D, I.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and possibly others, but common ones.

Now, we need to form a word with C and E, with the constraints.

Let's think of words that have C and E, with C in 2,3,4 and E in 1,3,4, and position 5 is a new letter.

Case 1: E in position 1.
Then, since E is in 1, it cannot be in 3 or 4, so positions 3 and 4 must be for C or other letters. But C must be in 2,3, or 4.

If E in 1, then:
- Position 1: E
- Position 2: could be C (if C in 2) or other
- Position 3: could be C or other
- Position 4: could be C or other
- Position 5: new letter

But C must be in one of 2,3,4.

For example, words like ""ECLAT"" but A is out.

""EJECT"" has J and T, but J is less common, and E in 1, C in 3? E,J,E,C,T? Not 5 letters.

""ELECT"" we thought earlier, but E in 1 and 3? ""ELECT"" has two E's, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, in position 3 is E, but E is already in position 1, so if the word has two E's, it's possible.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Another word: ""EPOCH"" we considered, but in guess2 we have M and I out, but ""epoch"" has O and P and H, which are new.

But in ""epoch"": E in 1, P in 2, O in 3, C in 4, H in 5.

Now, check positions:
- E in position 1: allowed (E can be in 1,3,4)
- C in position 4: allowed (C can be in 2,3,4)
- Position 5: H, new letter.

But we already guessed ""medic"" and got feedback, so we can't reuse the same word, but ""epoch"" is different.

In terms of constraints: E in 1 is possible, C in 4 is possible.

But we have feedback that E is not in position 2 (from guess2) and not in 5 (from guess1), so position 1 is a candidate.

Similarly, C not in 1 or 5, so position 4 is fine.

Also, letters: E, P, O, C, H. P, O, H are new and not excluded.

Excluded letters: R,A,N,M,D,I. P,O,H are not in that list.

So ""epoch"" could be a good guess.

But let's see other cases.

Case 2: E in position 3.
Then position 3: E
C must be in 2,3, or 4, but position 3 is E, so C cannot be in 3 if E is there (unless duplicate, but assume not). So C must be in 2 or 4.

Position 1: new letter (since E not in 1 in this case)
Position 2: could be C or new
Position 3: E
Position 4: could be C or new
Position 5: new letter

For example, ""BELCH"" - B, E, L, C, H. But E in position 2? ""belch"" is B1, E2, L3, C4, H5.

If E in position 3, we need E at position 3.

""BELCH"" has E at 2, not 3.

""SCREW"" has R and S, but R out.

""THEFT"" no C.

""CLECK"" not a word.

""FLECK"" - F, L, E, C, K. Positions: F1, L2, E3, C4, K5.

E in position 3, C in position 4.

Good: E in 3, C in 4.

Letters: F, L, E, C, K. F, L, K new.

No R,A,N,M,D,I.

""FLECK"" is a word? Yes, meaning a small particle or a mark.

Similarly, ""PLECK"" not common.

""WRECK"" has R, out.

""CHECK"" - C in position 1? C,H,E,C,K? C at 1 and 4? But C at position 1 is not allowed, since from guess1 C not in position 1.

""CHECK"" has C at 1, which is invalid.

So ""FLECK"" seems ok.

Case 3: E in position 4.
Then position 4: E
C must be in 2,3, or 4, but position 4 is E, so C must be in 2 or 3.

Position 1: new
Position 2: could be C or new
Position 3: could be C or new
Position 4: E
Position 5: new

For example, ""SPIEL"" no C.

""CHIDE"" C in 1, bad.

""THYME"" no C.

""BYTES"" no C.

""OUNCE"" has N, out.

""FORCE"" has R, out.

""HOUSE"" no C.

""LOVES"" no C.

""COPSE"" - C,O,P,S,E. C in 1, bad.

""SCUPE"" not a word.

""EXCEL"" we thought earlier: E in 1 and 4, but if E in position 4, then position 1 is also E? ""EXCEL"" has E at 1 and 4, so if we consider E in position 4, then C is at position 3.

But E is also at position 1, which might be possible if duplicates.

But let's avoid for now.

""CELLO"" C in 1, bad.

So E in position 4 might be harder to find without C in 1.

Perhaps ""OCTET"" - O,C,T,E,T. C in position 2? O1, C2, T3, E4, T5.

E in position 4, C in position 2.

Good.

Letters: O, C, T, E, T. T repeated, but possible.

O and T new.

No R,A,N,M,D,I.

""OCTET"" is a word.

But T repeated.

Another: ""ACTED"" has A, out.

""ELECT"" E in 1 and 4, C in 5? E1, L2, E3, C4, T5? ""elect"" is E1,L2,E3,C4,T5. So E in 1 and 3, C in 4. But we are considering E in position 4 case, but here E is in 1 and 3, not solely in 4.

For E in position 4, we have ""OCTET"" as an example.

But let's go back to the options.

We have three main cases for E position: 1, 3, or 4.

With words:
- E in 1: ""EPOCH""
- E in 3: ""FLECK""
- E in 4: ""OCTET"" or similar

Now, we also need to consider that in position 5, it must be a new letter, and we want to test new letters to get more information.

In ""EPOCH"": tests P, O, H
In ""FLECK"": tests F, L, K
In ""OCTET"": tests O, T, but T repeated, less info.

""FLECK"" seems good.

But let's see if there is a word that covers more common letters.

Another word for E in position 3: ""SWEET"" no C.

""CREPT"" C in 1, bad.

""BLEEP"" B,L,E,E,P - E in 3 and 4? B1,L2,E3,E4,P5. But E in 3 and 4, and C missing.

No C.

""CREME"" C in 1, bad.

So ""FLECK"" or ""epoch"".

I think ""epoch"" is a good choice because it tests E in position 1 and C in position 4, both of which are possible, and new letters P, O, H.

Similarly, ""FLECK"" tests E in 3 and C in 4.

But position 4 for C is tested in both, but different E positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that can help distinguish the positions.

We know E can be in 1,3,4; C in 2,3,4.

If I guess ""epoch"":
- If E is in position 1, we might get E(✓) and C(-) or something.
- If E is not in 1, we get E(-) meaning E is in 3 or 4.

Similarly for C.

But let's not overcomplicate.

I think ""epoch"" is a solid choice.

But in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and ""medic"", both with common letters.

""EPOCH"" is also common.

Another word: ""CLOSE"" but C in 1, bad.

""POETS"" no C.

I think I'll go with ""epoch"".

But let's confirm the feedback.

In guess2, we have E in position 2 which was wrong, so in ""epoch"" E is in position 1, which is new.

Similarly, C in position 4, which was not tested before (in guess1 C was position 1, in guess2 C was position 5, so position 4 is new).

Position 4 was tested in guess1 with N, which is absent, so position 4 could be C.

Similarly, position 1 was C in guess1, wrong, so could be E.

So <guess>epoch</guess>

But the format should be <guess>epoch</guess>

In the response, I need to output only the guess in that format.

But first, I should think step by step.

Perhaps there is a better word.

Another word: ""BOULE"" no C.

""SCULK"" no E.

I think ""epoch"" is fine.

Or ""FLECK"".

But ""FLECK"" has K, which is less common.

""epoch"" has P, O, H, more common.

""BLOCS"" no E.

""COVET"" C in 1, bad.

So I'll go with ""epoch"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
  - C and E are in the word but not in positions 1 or 5, respectively.
  - R, A, and N are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: medic → M(x) E(-) D(x) I(x) C(-)**  
  - E is not in position 2, and C is not in position 5.
  - M, D, and I are not in the word.

### Key Inferences:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: C and E.
- **C position constraints**: Cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1) or position 5 (from Guess 2), so C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- **E position constraints**: Cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 1) or position 2 (from Guess 2), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- **Excluded letters**: R, A, N, M, D, I (cannot appear in the word).
- **Position 5 constraint**: Cannot be C or E (based on feedback), so it must be a new letter.
- **Strategy for next guess**: Test E in a new position (position 1 or 3 or 4, but not 2) and C in a new position (position 2, 3, or 4, but not 1 or 5). Introduce new letters to gather more information. Avoid excluded letters.

### Chosen Guess: ""epoch""
- **Breakdown**:
  - E in position 1 (tests a new position for E, which is allowed).
  - C in position 4 (tests a new position for C, which is allowed).
  - New letters tested: P (position 2), O (position 3), H (position 5) – all are common and not excluded.
- **Why this word?**:
  - Satisfies all constraints: C and E are included, excluded letters are avoided, and positions align with feedback.
  - Tests E in position 1 (a possible location) and C in position 4 (a possible location), which can help narrow down their correct positions.
  - Maximizes information gain by introducing three new letters (P, O, H) in untested positions.

<guess>epoch</guess>",epoch,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)

- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Letters not in the word: R, A, N, M, D, I (from the x's)

Letters that are in the word: C and E (from both guesses, and they are confirmed present).

For C:
- From guess 1: not in position 1.
- From guess 2: not in position 5.
- So C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

For E:

However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate indications, so we should consider the possibility.

But for now, let's assume no duplicates until we see evidence.

So, possible positions:

- Position 1: could be E (since E can be in 1,3,4) or a new letter.
- Position 2: could be C (since C can be in 2,3,4) or a new letter, but not E (since E not in position 2).
- Position 3: could be C or E or a new letter.
- Position 4: could be C or E or a new letter.
- Position 5: cannot be E (from guess1) and cannot be C (from guess2), so must be a new letter.

Also, we must avoid the letters: R, A, N, M, D, I.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and possibly others, but common ones.

Now, we need to form a word with C and E, with the constraints.

Case 1: E in position 1.
Then, since E is in 1, it cannot be in 3 or 4, so positions 3 and 4 must be for C or other letters. But C must be in 2,3, or 4.

If E in 1, then:
- Position 1: E
- Position 2: could be C (if C in 2) or other
- Position 3: could be C or other
- Position 4: could be C or other
- Position 5: new letter

But C must be in one of 2,3,4.

For example, words like ""ECLAT"" but A is out.

""EJECT"" has J and T, but J is less common, and E in 1, C in 3? E,J,E,C,T? Not 5 letters.

""ELECT"" we thought earlier, but E in 1 and 3? ""ELECT"" has two E's, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, in position 3 is E, but E is already in position 1, so if the word has two E's, it's possible.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Another word: ""EPOCH"" we considered, but in guess2 we have M and I out, but ""epoch"" has O and P and H, which are new.

But in ""epoch"": E in 1, P in 2, O in 3, C in 4, H in 5.

Now, check positions:
- E in position 1: allowed (E can be in 1,3,4)
- C in position 4: allowed (C can be in 2,3,4)
- Position 5: H, new letter.

But we already guessed ""medic"" and got feedback, so we can't reuse the same word, but ""epoch"" is different.

In terms of constraints: E in 1 is possible, C in 4 is possible.

But we have feedback that E is not in position 2 (from guess2) and not in 5 (from guess1), so position 1 is a candidate.

Similarly, C not in 1 or 5, so position 4 is fine.

Also, letters: E, P, O, C, H. P, O, H are new and not excluded.

Excluded letters: R,A,N,M,D,I. P,O,H are not in that list.

So ""epoch"" could be a good guess.

But let's see other cases.

Case 2: E in position 3.
Then position 3: E
C must be in 2,3, or 4, but position 3 is E, so C cannot be in 3 if E is there (unless duplicate, but assume not). So C must be in 2 or 4.

Position 1: new letter (since E not in 1 in this case)
Position 2: could be C or new
Position 3: E
Position 4: could be C or new
Position 5: new letter

For example, ""BELCH"" - B, E, L, C, H. But E in position 2? ""belch"" is B1, E2, L3, C4, H5.

If E in position 3, we need E at position 3.

""BELCH"" has E at 2, not 3.

""SCREW"" has R and S, but R out.

""THEFT"" no C.

""CLECK"" not a word.

""FLECK"" - F, L, E, C, K. Positions: F1, L2, E3, C4, K5.

E in position 3, C in position 4.

Good: E in 3, C in 4.

Letters: F, L, E, C, K. F, L, K new.

No R,A,N,M,D,I.

""FLECK"" is a word? Yes, meaning a small particle or a mark.

Similarly, ""PLECK"" not common.

""WRECK"" has R, out.

""CHECK"" - C in position 1? C,H,E,C,K? C at 1 and 4? But C at position 1 is not allowed, since from guess1 C not in position 1.

""CHECK"" has C at 1, which is invalid.

So ""FLECK"" seems ok.

Case 3: E in position 4.
Then position 4: E
C must be in 2,3, or 4, but position 4 is E, so C must be in 2 or 3.

Position 1: new
Position 2: could be C or new
Position 3: could be C or new
Position 4: E
Position 5: new

For example, ""SPIEL"" no C.

""CHIDE"" C in 1, bad.

""THYME"" no C.

""BYTES"" no C.

""OUNCE"" has N, out.

""FORCE"" has R, out.

""HOUSE"" no C.

""LOVES"" no C.

""COPSE"" - C,O,P,S,E. C in 1, bad.

""SCUPE"" not a word.

""EXCEL"" we thought earlier: E in 1 and 4, but if E in position 4, then position 1 is also E? ""EXCEL"" has E at 1 and 4, so if we consider E in position 4, then C is at position 3.

But E is also at position 1, which might be possible if duplicates.

But let's avoid for now.

""CELLO"" C in 1, bad.

So E in position 4 might be harder to find without C in 1.

Perhaps ""OCTET"" - O,C,T,E,T. C in position 2? O1, C2, T3, E4, T5.

E in position 4, C in position 2.

Good.

Letters: O, C, T, E, T. T repeated, but possible.

O and T new.

No R,A,N,M,D,I.

""OCTET"" is a word.

But T repeated.

Another: ""ACTED"" has A, out.

""ELECT"" E in 1 and 4, C in 5? E1, L2, E3, C4, T5? ""elect"" is E1,L2,E3,C4,T5. So E in 1 and 3, C in 4. But we are considering E in position 4 case, but here E is in 1 and 3, not solely in 4.

For E in position 4, we have ""OCTET"" as an example.

But let's go back to the options.

We have three main cases for E position: 1, 3, or 4.

With words:
- E in 1: ""EPOCH""
- E in 3: ""FLECK""
- E in 4: ""OCTET"" or similar

Now, we also need to consider that in position 5, it must be a new letter, and we want to test new letters to get more information.

In ""EPOCH"": tests P, O, H
In ""FLECK"": tests F, L, K
In ""OCTET"": tests O, T, but T repeated, less info.

""FLECK"" seems good.

But let's see if there is a word that covers more common letters.

Another word for E in position 3: ""SWEET"" no C.

""CREPT"" C in 1, bad.

""BLEEP"" B,L,E,E,P - E in 3 and 4? B1,L2,E3,E4,P5. But E in 3 and 4, and C missing.

No C.

""CREME"" C in 1, bad.

So ""FLECK"" or ""epoch"".

I think ""epoch"" is a good choice because it tests E in position 1 and C in position 4, both of which are possible, and new letters P, O, H.

Similarly, ""FLECK"" tests E in 3 and C in 4.

But position 4 for C is tested in both, but different E positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that can help distinguish the positions.

We know E can be in 1,3,4; C in 2,3,4.

If I guess ""epoch"":
- If E is in position 1, we might get E(✓) and C(-) or something.
- If E is not in 1, we get E(-) meaning E is in 3 or 4.

Similarly for C.

But let's not overcomplicate.

I think ""epoch"" is a solid choice.

But in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and ""medic"", both with common letters.

""EPOCH"" is also common.

Another word: ""CLOSE"" but C in 1, bad.

""POETS"" no C.

I think I'll go with ""epoch"".

But let's confirm the feedback.

In guess2, we have E in position 2 which was wrong, so in ""epoch"" E is in position 1, which is new.

Similarly, C in position 4, which was not tested before (in guess1 C was position 1, in guess2 C was position 5, so position 4 is new).

Position 4 was tested in guess1 with N, which is absent, so position 4 could be C.

Similarly, position 1 was C in guess1, wrong, so could be E.

So <guess>epoch</guess>

But the format should be <guess>epoch</guess>

In the response, I need to output only the guess in that format.

But first, I should think step by step.

Perhaps there is a better word.

Another word: ""BOULE"" no C.

""SCULK"" no E.

I think ""epoch"" is fine.

Or ""FLECK"".

But ""FLECK"" has K, which is less common.

""epoch"" has P, O, H, more common.

""BLOCS"" no E.

""COVET"" C in 1, bad.

So I'll go with ""epoch"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
  - C and E are in the word but not in positions 1 or 5, respectively.
  - R, A, and N are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: medic → M(x) E(-) D(x) I(x) C(-)**  
  - E is not in position 2, and C is not in position 5.
  - M, D, and I are not in the word.

### Key Inferences:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: C and E.
- **C position constraints**: Cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1) or position 5 (from Guess 2), so C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- **E position constraints**: Cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 1) or position 2 (from Guess 2), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- **Excluded letters**: R, A, N, M, D, I (cannot appear in the word).
- **Position 5 constraint**: Cannot be C or E (based on feedback), so it must be a new letter.
- **Strategy for next guess**: Test E in a new position (position 1 or 3 or 4, but not 2) and C in a new position (position 2, 3, or 4, but not 1 or 5). Introduce new letters to gather more information. Avoid excluded letters.

### Chosen Guess: ""epoch""
- **Breakdown**:
  - E in position 1 (tests a new position for E, which is allowed).
  - C in position 4 (tests a new position for C, which is allowed).
  - New letters tested: P (position 2), O (position 3), H (position 5) – all are common and not excluded.
- **Why this word?**:
  - Satisfies all constraints: C and E are included, excluded letters are avoided, and positions align with feedback.
  - Tests E in position 1 (a possible location) and C in position 4 (a possible location), which can help narrow down their correct positions.
  - Maximizes information gain by introducing three new letters (P, O, H) in untested positions.",Guess 3: epoch -> FEEDBACK: E(-) P(✓) O(x) C(✓) H(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,speck,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the feedback for my first guess ""crane"" is: C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-). This means:

- C is in the word but not in the correct position (since it's marked with -).
- R is not in the word at all (marked with x).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in the correct position (marked with -).

So, from this, I know that the secret word contains C and E, but not in the positions I guessed. Specifically:

- C was in position 1 of my guess, but it's not correct there. So in the secret word, C is not in position 1.
- E was in position 5, but it's not correct there, so E is not in position 5.
- R, A, and N are completely absent from the secret word.

Letters not in the word: R, A, N.

Letters that are in the word: C and E.

Now, I need to make a second guess. My new word must:
- Be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Include C and E since they are part of the secret word.
- Not include R, A, or N.
- Position C and E in positions different from 1 and 5, respectively, since those positions were incorrect for them.

C can't be in position 1, and E can't be in position 5.

Also, since C and E are present but misplaced, I should try them in new positions.

I need to think of words that contain C and E, and exclude R, A, N.

Common consonants to consider: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But vowels: E is already included, so I might need other vowels like I, O, U (since A is out).

Since E is in the word, and C, other letters could be common ones.

A good approach is to use a word that tests new letters while placing C and E in different positions.

Let me list some words that have C and E, and don't have R, A, N.

For example:
- PIECE: But P, I, E, C. E is at the end, but in position 5 for ""crane"" was wrong, so position 5 is bad for E. ""piece"" has E in position 5, which might be invalid if E can't be in position 5? The feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in position 4 or something else, but in a new word, I should avoid position 5 for E.

Similarly, C is not in position 1, so in a new word, C should not be in position 1.

So for my second guess, I need C not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

Possible words:
- How about ""SPICE"": S, P, I, C, E. C is in position 4, E in position 5. But E is in position 5, and the feedback said E is not in position 5, so I shouldn't put E in position 5 again. Putting E in position 5 might be wasteful because I know it's wrong, but I could still guess it to confirm or get more info, but ideally, I should place it in a new position to get positional information.

Similarly for C.

In ""SPICE"", C is in position 4, which is new (was position 1 before), and E is in position 5, which is known wrong, so not good.

Better to have E in a different position.

Another word: ""THIEF"" – but no C, I need C.

Word with C and E.

""DECOY"" – D, E, C, O, Y. That might work.
- Positions: E in position 2, C in position 3, neither position 1 nor 5.
- Letters: D, E, C, O, Y. None of R, A, N.

But O and Y are new.

""MEDIC"" – M, E, D, I, C. E in position 2, C in position 5. Position 5 for C? C was not position 1, but position 5 might be ok for C since we don't know about position 5 yet for C. Only E was misplaced in position 5, C was misplaced in position 1.

For E, position 5 is bad; for C, any position except 1 could be possible.

In ""medic"", E is position 2 (good), C is position 5. But E is in position 2, which was not the position previously, but the secret word might have E in position 2.

C at position 5: could be possible.

Letters: M, E, D, I, C. R, A, N absent – good.

What about ""CLIME""? C is at position 1 again, which is bad because C cannot be in position 1. So avoid C in position 1.

""SCENE"": C in position 2? S, C, E, N, E. But N is in it – N is not in the word, since from feedback, N is absent. So ""scene"" has N, which is eliminated; can't use.

""PIECE"" has E at end position, and P and I.

But E at position 5 is bad.

So better options.

Let's think of words with E not in position 5.

For example, ""HONEY"" but has N, no.

""COULD"" – C, O, U, L, D. But E is needed? E must be in the word, so I have to include E.

Words that must contain C and E.

Possible words, with C not in 1, E not in 5.

Option: ""PRICE"" – P, R, I, C, E. But R is in it, and R is eliminated – no, feedback said R(x), meaning R not in word, so can't have R.

Important: exclude R, A, N.

In ""price"", it has R, so invalid.

""SPICE"" – S, P, I, C, E. Letters: S, P, I, C, E. S, P, I are new, C in position 4, E in position 5.

E in position 5 – but I know position 5 is wrong for E, so this might not be efficient. I could use it to confirm other letters.

Perhaps I should choose a word where I can place E in a middle position.

Another word: ""ELECT"" – E, L, E, C, T. E in position 1 and position 4; C in position 5? Positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:E, 4:C, 5:T. E in position 1 and 3, but position 1 might be ok? Only C was position 1 issue; E wasn't in position 1 before.

In first guess ""crane"", E was position 5, not position 1. So position 1 could be possible for E or other letters.

But C cannot be position 1.

In ""elect"", E in position 1, L, E in position 3, C in position 4, T in position 5.

C is in position 4, which is new and not position 1, good.

E is in position 1 and 3; position 5 is avoided.

Also, no R, A, N; letters are E, L, C, T.

But it has E twice. Is that allowed? The secret word might have repeated letters, but the feedback doesn't indicate that here.

Whether to repeat letters or not, it might be inefficient, but possible.

Another word: ""CLEAR"" – but C in position 1, bad, and R and A are out.

No.

""SCENT"" – S, C, E, N, T. But N is in it, eliminated.

No N.

Possible words: let's list: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z; vowels I, O, U can be used.

Words with C and E: e.g., ""PIECE"", but E at end.

""CEDES"" – C in position 1? Bad.

""DEUCE"" – D, E, U, C, E. Positions: E in position 2 and 5; position 5 is bad, and C in position 4.

But E in position 2 and 5; position 5 invalid.

""EXCEL"" – E, X, C, E, L. E in position 1 and 4; C in position 3. Good: C not in 1, E not in 5? E is in position 1 and 4, position 5 avoid.

""EXCEL"" is 5 letters: E, X, C, E, L. Positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:C, 4:E, 5:L.

So E in position 1 and position 4. Position 5 is L, not E.

From feedback, E is in the word but not position 5, so position 1 for E could be possible, position 4 for E could be possible.

C in position 3, not position 1, good.

Letters: E, X, C, E, L – E repeated, X and L new.

No R, A, N.

""EXCEL"" could work.

Another word: ""SCALE"" – S, C, A, L, E – but A is eliminated, can't.

""TOPIC"" – T, O, P, I, C – no E, not good.

Must have E.

""CELLO"" – C, E, L, L, O – C in position 1, bad.

Perhaps ""MINCE"" – M, I, N, C, E – N is in it, eliminated.

No N.

So ""EXCEL"" seems decent.

Other options: ""CLOUD"" no E.

""HOUSE"" no C.

""SPICE"" as I thought earlier: S, P, I, C, E. Positions: S1, P2, I3, C4, E5. C in position 4, good; E in position 5, which is known wrong. If I guess E in position 5, and it's wrong, I get x for E if it's not there, but I know E is in the word, so it should be - if position is wrong or ✓ if correct. But since position 5 is wrong (based on first feedback), I'll likely get - again, which doesn't give new info. Whereas if I place E in a new position, I might get more.

For example, if E in position 5 is wrong, putting it there gives me - and tells me it's still wrong, but I might not learn the correct position.

Whereas putting E in position 1, for example, I could get - or ✓.

Similarly for other positions.

So better to place E in a position not tested before, like position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Position 4 was not tested in ""crane""; positions tested were C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5).

So positions tested: position 1,2,3,4,5, but with specific letters.

Now, position 1 had C which is wrong; position 2 had R not present; position 3 had A not present; position 4 had N not present; position 5 had E wrong position.

For new word, I should try C in positions 2,3,4 or 5; E in positions 1,2,3 or 4.

Position 4 for C? In first guess, position 4 was N, not C.

Perhaps ""SPIEL"" no C.

Word: ""OUNCE"" – O, U, N, C, E – N in it, no.

""FORCE"" – F, O, R, C, E – R in it, no.

""TWICE"" – T, W, I, C, E. Positions: T1, W2, I3, C4, E5. C position 4, E position 5. Again E at end.

""BELIE"" no C.

""MEDIC"" as before: M, E, D, I, C. Positions: M1, E2, D3, I4, C5. E in position 2, C in position 5. Position 2 for E: not tested before; position 5 for C: not tested.

Good. And E not in 5, C not in 1. Position 5 for C might be fine.

Letters: M, E, D, I, C. All new except E and C, and E at position 2, C at position 5.

No R, A, N.

""MEDIC"" seems like a good guess.

""DEVICE"" too long.

""EPOCH"" – E, P, O, C, H. Positions: E1, P2, O3, C4, H5. E in position 1, C in position 4. Both C and E in new positions. Position 1 for E? Not tested; position 4 for C, not tested.

Letters: E, P, O, C, H. New letters P, O, H.

Also good.

Between ""MEDIC"" and ""EPOCH"", ""medic"" places E in position 2 and C in position 5, while ""epoch"" places E in position 1 and C in position 4.

Position 2 was previously R, not present, so any letter ok.

Similarly, position 5 for C could be ok.

I think both are valid.

Another word: ""CHOSE"" – C in position 1, bad.

Avoid C in position 1.

""SPACE"" – S, P, A, C, E – A present, eliminated.

No.

""CRUET"" – C in position 1, R present, bad.

Perhaps ""TOPEC"" not a word.

I think ""medic"" or ""epoch"" are fine.

Let me choose ""medic"" for now.

""medic"" – M at position 1, which is new; E at position 2, which was R's position but R not in word, so E could be there; D at position 3; I at position 4; C at position 5.

Good.

So I'll go with ""medic"".

But earlier I thought about ""EXCEL"" – E at position 1, which is new position.

In ""crane"", position 1 was C wrong, but position 1 could be E or other.

For example, E in position 1: if correct, I get ✓; if wrong, I get - or x, but since E is in word, if position 1 is E, ✓; if not, probably - implying E is elsewhere.

Similarly.

But ""medic"" tests position 2 and 5.

I think it's fine.

To avoid E in position 5, but in ""medic"" E is in position 2, C in position 5.

Position 5 is fine for C.

Similarly, in ""epoch"", E in position 1, C in position 4.

Both ok.

I'll choose ""MEDIC"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C is present but not in position 1 (marked with -), so C must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked with -), so E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- R, A, and N are absent from the word (marked with x), so they cannot be in the new guess.
- The new guess must include C and E, and exclude R, A, N, while placing C not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

A good second guess should:
- Test C and E in new positions not ruled out.
- Introduce new letters to gain more information.
- Avoid placing E in position 5 (known incorrect) and C in position 1 (known incorrect).

After considering possible words, ""medic"" is a valid choice:
- Positions: M (position 1), E (position 2), D (position 3), I (position 4), C (position 5).
- C is placed in position 5 (new position, not position 1).
- E is placed in position 2 (new position, not position 5).
- Includes new letters M, D, I to test.
- Excludes R, A, N as required.

<guess>medic</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: medic -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) D(x) I(x) C(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""medic"" -> M(x), E(-), D(x), I(x), C(-)
Meaning:
- M is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (since it's marked -).
- D is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- C is in the word but not in position 5.

Now, combining the information:

Letters not in the word: R, A, N, M, D, I (from the x's)

Letters that are in the word: C and E (from both guesses, and they are confirmed present).

For C:
- From guess 1: not in position 1.
- From guess 2: not in position 5.
- So C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

For E:
- From guess 1: not in position 5.
- From guess 2: not in position 2.
- So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Also, the word has 5 letters, and we know only C and E are in the word so far (from the letters we've tested). But we have tested 10 unique letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, D, I. That leaves many letters untested.

We need to find a word that:
- Contains C and E.
- C is in position 2, 3, or 4.
- E is in position 1, 3, or 4.
- But note: positions 3 and 4 could be either C or E, but not both at the same time unless the word has duplicate letters? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but in Wordle, duplicates are possible.

However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate indications, so we should consider the possibility.

But for now, let's assume no duplicates until we see evidence.

So, possible positions:

- Position 1: could be E (since E can be in 1,3,4) or a new letter.
- Position 2: could be C (since C can be in 2,3,4) or a new letter, but not E (since E not in position 2).
- Position 3: could be C or E or a new letter.
- Position 4: could be C or E or a new letter.
- Position 5: cannot be E (from guess1) and cannot be C (from guess2), so must be a new letter.

Also, we must avoid the letters: R, A, N, M, D, I.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and possibly others, but common ones.

Now, we need to form a word with C and E, with the constraints.

Let's think of words that have C and E, with C in 2,3,4 and E in 1,3,4, and position 5 is a new letter.

Case 1: E in position 1.
Then, since E is in 1, it cannot be in 3 or 4, so positions 3 and 4 must be for C or other letters. But C must be in 2,3, or 4.

If E in 1, then:
- Position 1: E
- Position 2: could be C (if C in 2) or other
- Position 3: could be C or other
- Position 4: could be C or other
- Position 5: new letter

But C must be in one of 2,3,4.

For example, words like ""ECLAT"" but A is out.

""EJECT"" has J and T, but J is less common, and E in 1, C in 3? E,J,E,C,T? Not 5 letters.

""ELECT"" we thought earlier, but E in 1 and 3? ""ELECT"" has two E's, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, in position 3 is E, but E is already in position 1, so if the word has two E's, it's possible.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

Another word: ""EPOCH"" we considered, but in guess2 we have M and I out, but ""epoch"" has O and P and H, which are new.

But in ""epoch"": E in 1, P in 2, O in 3, C in 4, H in 5.

Now, check positions:
- E in position 1: allowed (E can be in 1,3,4)
- C in position 4: allowed (C can be in 2,3,4)
- Position 5: H, new letter.

But we already guessed ""medic"" and got feedback, so we can't reuse the same word, but ""epoch"" is different.

In terms of constraints: E in 1 is possible, C in 4 is possible.

But we have feedback that E is not in position 2 (from guess2) and not in 5 (from guess1), so position 1 is a candidate.

Similarly, C not in 1 or 5, so position 4 is fine.

Also, letters: E, P, O, C, H. P, O, H are new and not excluded.

Excluded letters: R,A,N,M,D,I. P,O,H are not in that list.

So ""epoch"" could be a good guess.

But let's see other cases.

Case 2: E in position 3.
Then position 3: E
C must be in 2,3, or 4, but position 3 is E, so C cannot be in 3 if E is there (unless duplicate, but assume not). So C must be in 2 or 4.

Position 1: new letter (since E not in 1 in this case)
Position 2: could be C or new
Position 3: E
Position 4: could be C or new
Position 5: new letter

For example, ""BELCH"" - B, E, L, C, H. But E in position 2? ""belch"" is B1, E2, L3, C4, H5.

If E in position 3, we need E at position 3.

""BELCH"" has E at 2, not 3.

""SCREW"" has R and S, but R out.

""THEFT"" no C.

""CLECK"" not a word.

""FLECK"" - F, L, E, C, K. Positions: F1, L2, E3, C4, K5.

E in position 3, C in position 4.

Good: E in 3, C in 4.

Letters: F, L, E, C, K. F, L, K new.

No R,A,N,M,D,I.

""FLECK"" is a word? Yes, meaning a small particle or a mark.

Similarly, ""PLECK"" not common.

""WRECK"" has R, out.

""CHECK"" - C in position 1? C,H,E,C,K? C at 1 and 4? But C at position 1 is not allowed, since from guess1 C not in position 1.

""CHECK"" has C at 1, which is invalid.

So ""FLECK"" seems ok.

Case 3: E in position 4.
Then position 4: E
C must be in 2,3, or 4, but position 4 is E, so C must be in 2 or 3.

Position 1: new
Position 2: could be C or new
Position 3: could be C or new
Position 4: E
Position 5: new

For example, ""SPIEL"" no C.

""CHIDE"" C in 1, bad.

""THYME"" no C.

""BYTES"" no C.

""OUNCE"" has N, out.

""FORCE"" has R, out.

""HOUSE"" no C.

""LOVES"" no C.

""COPSE"" - C,O,P,S,E. C in 1, bad.

""SCUPE"" not a word.

""EXCEL"" we thought earlier: E in 1 and 4, but if E in position 4, then position 1 is also E? ""EXCEL"" has E at 1 and 4, so if we consider E in position 4, then C is at position 3.

But E is also at position 1, which might be possible if duplicates.

But let's avoid for now.

""CELLO"" C in 1, bad.

So E in position 4 might be harder to find without C in 1.

Perhaps ""OCTET"" - O,C,T,E,T. C in position 2? O1, C2, T3, E4, T5.

E in position 4, C in position 2.

Good.

Letters: O, C, T, E, T. T repeated, but possible.

O and T new.

No R,A,N,M,D,I.

""OCTET"" is a word.

But T repeated.

Another: ""ACTED"" has A, out.

""ELECT"" E in 1 and 4, C in 5? E1, L2, E3, C4, T5? ""elect"" is E1,L2,E3,C4,T5. So E in 1 and 3, C in 4. But we are considering E in position 4 case, but here E is in 1 and 3, not solely in 4.

For E in position 4, we have ""OCTET"" as an example.

But let's go back to the options.

We have three main cases for E position: 1, 3, or 4.

With words:
- E in 1: ""EPOCH""
- E in 3: ""FLECK""
- E in 4: ""OCTET"" or similar

Now, we also need to consider that in position 5, it must be a new letter, and we want to test new letters to get more information.

In ""EPOCH"": tests P, O, H
In ""FLECK"": tests F, L, K
In ""OCTET"": tests O, T, but T repeated, less info.

""FLECK"" seems good.

But let's see if there is a word that covers more common letters.

Another word for E in position 3: ""SWEET"" no C.

""CREPT"" C in 1, bad.

""BLEEP"" B,L,E,E,P - E in 3 and 4? B1,L2,E3,E4,P5. But E in 3 and 4, and C missing.

No C.

""CREME"" C in 1, bad.

So ""FLECK"" or ""epoch"".

I think ""epoch"" is a good choice because it tests E in position 1 and C in position 4, both of which are possible, and new letters P, O, H.

Similarly, ""FLECK"" tests E in 3 and C in 4.

But position 4 for C is tested in both, but different E positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that can help distinguish the positions.

We know E can be in 1,3,4; C in 2,3,4.

If I guess ""epoch"":
- If E is in position 1, we might get E(✓) and C(-) or something.
- If E is not in 1, we get E(-) meaning E is in 3 or 4.

Similarly for C.

But let's not overcomplicate.

I think ""epoch"" is a solid choice.

But in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and ""medic"", both with common letters.

""EPOCH"" is also common.

Another word: ""CLOSE"" but C in 1, bad.

""POETS"" no C.

I think I'll go with ""epoch"".

But let's confirm the feedback.

In guess2, we have E in position 2 which was wrong, so in ""epoch"" E is in position 1, which is new.

Similarly, C in position 4, which was not tested before (in guess1 C was position 1, in guess2 C was position 5, so position 4 is new).

Position 4 was tested in guess1 with N, which is absent, so position 4 could be C.

Similarly, position 1 was C in guess1, wrong, so could be E.

So <guess>epoch</guess>

But the format should be <guess>epoch</guess>

In the response, I need to output only the guess in that format.

But first, I should think step by step.

Perhaps there is a better word.

Another word: ""BOULE"" no C.

""SCULK"" no E.

I think ""epoch"" is fine.

Or ""FLECK"".

But ""FLECK"" has K, which is less common.

""epoch"" has P, O, H, more common.

""BLOCS"" no E.

""COVET"" C in 1, bad.

So I'll go with ""epoch"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
  - C and E are in the word but not in positions 1 or 5, respectively.
  - R, A, and N are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: medic → M(x) E(-) D(x) I(x) C(-)**  
  - E is not in position 2, and C is not in position 5.
  - M, D, and I are not in the word.

### Key Inferences:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: C and E.
- **C position constraints**: Cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1) or position 5 (from Guess 2), so C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- **E position constraints**: Cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 1) or position 2 (from Guess 2), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- **Excluded letters**: R, A, N, M, D, I (cannot appear in the word).
- **Position 5 constraint**: Cannot be C or E (based on feedback), so it must be a new letter.
- **Strategy for next guess**: Test E in a new position (position 1 or 3 or 4, but not 2) and C in a new position (position 2, 3, or 4, but not 1 or 5). Introduce new letters to gather more information. Avoid excluded letters.

### Chosen Guess: ""epoch""
- **Breakdown**:
  - E in position 1 (tests a new position for E, which is allowed).
  - C in position 4 (tests a new position for C, which is allowed).
  - New letters tested: P (position 2), O (position 3), H (position 5) – all are common and not excluded.
- **Why this word?**:
  - Satisfies all constraints: C and E are included, excluded letters are avoided, and positions align with feedback.
  - Tests E in position 1 (a possible location) and C in position 4 (a possible location), which can help narrow down their correct positions.
  - Maximizes information gain by introducing three new letters (P, O, H) in untested positions.

E is at the end, but in position 5 for ""crane"" was wrong, so position 5 is bad for E. ""piece"" has E in position 5, which might be invalid if E can\'t be in position 5? The feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in position 4 or something else, but in a new word, I should avoid position 5 for E.\n\nSimilarly, C is not in position 1, so in a new word, C should not be in position 1.\n\nSo for my second guess, I need C not in position 1 and E not in position 5.\n\nPossible words:\n- How about ""SPICE"": S, P, I, C, E. C is in position 4, E in position 5. But E is in position 5, and the feedback said E is not in position 5, so I shouldn\'t put E in position 5 again. Putting E in position 5 might be wasteful because I know it\'s wrong, but I could still guess it to confirm or get more info, but ideally, I should place it in a new position to get positional information.\n\nSimilarly for C.\n\nIn ""SPICE"", C is in position 4, which is new (was position 1 before), and E is in position 5, which is known wrong, so not good.\n\nBetter to have E in a different position.\n\nAnother word: ""THIEF"" – but no C, I need C.\n\nWord with C and E.\n\n""DECOY"" – D, E, C, O, Y. That might work.\n- Positions: E in position 2, C in position 3, neither position 1 nor 5.\n- Letters: D, E, C, O, Y. None of R, A, N.\n\nBut O and Y are new.\n\n""MEDIC"" – M, E, D, I, C. E in position 2, C in position 5. Position 5 for C? C was not position 1, but position 5 might be ok for C since we don\'t know about position 5 yet for C. Only E was misplaced in position 5, C was misplaced in position 1.\n\nFor E, position 5 is bad; for C, any position except 1 could be possible.\n\nIn ""medic"", E is position 2 (good), C is position 5.

But R is in it, and R is eliminated – no, feedback said R(x), meaning R not in word, so can\'t have R.\n\nImportant: exclude R, A, N.\n\nIn ""price"", it has R, so invalid.\n\n""SPICE"" – S, P, I, C, E. Letters: S, P, I, C, E. S, P, I are new, C in position 4, E in position 5.\n\nE in position 5 – but I know position 5 is wrong for E, so this might not be efficient.

Positions: S1, P2, I3, C4, E5. C in position 4, good; E in position 5, which is known wrong. If I guess E in position 5, and it\'s wrong, I get x for E if it\'s not there, but I know E is in the word, so it should be - if position is wrong or ✓ if correct. But since position 5 is wrong (based on first feedback), I\'ll likely get - again, which doesn\'t give new info. Whereas if I place E in a new position, I might get more.\n\nFor example, if E in position 5 is wrong, putting it there gives me - and tells me it\'s still wrong, but I might not learn the correct position.\n\nWhereas putting E in position 1, for example, I could get - or ✓.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nSo better to place E in a position not tested before, like position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nPosition 4 was not tested in ""crane""; positions tested were C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5).\n\nSo positions tested: position 1,2,3,4,5, but with specific letters.\n\nNow, position 1 had C which is wrong; position 2 had R not present; position 3 had A not present; position 4 had N not present; position 5 had E wrong position.\n\nFor new word, I should try C in positions 2,3,4 or 5; E in positions 1,2,3 or 4.\n\nPosition 4 for C?

We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but in Wordle, duplicates are possible.\n\nHowever, in the feedback, we haven\'t seen any duplicate indications, so we should consider the possibility.\n\nBut for now, let\'s assume no duplicates until we see evidence.\n\nSo, possible positions:\n\n- Position 1: could be E (since E can be in 1,3,4) or a new letter.\n- Position 2: could be C (since C can be in 2,3,4) or a new letter, but not E (since E not in position 2).\n- Position 3: could be C or E or a new letter.\n- Position 4: could be C or E or a new letter.\n- Position 5: cannot be E (from guess1) and cannot be C (from guess2), so must be a new letter.\n\nAlso, we must avoid the letters: R, A, N, M, D, I.\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and possibly others, but common ones.\n\nNow, we need to form a word with C and E, with the constraints.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have C and E, with C in 2,3,4 and E in 1,3,4, and position 5 is a new letter.\n\nCase 1: E in position 1.\nThen, since E is in 1, it cannot be in 3 or 4, so positions 3 and 4 must be for C or other letters.

E,J,E,C,T? Not 5 letters.\n\n""ELECT"" we thought earlier, but E in 1 and 3? ""ELECT"" has two E\'s, but we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, in position 3 is E, but E is already in position 1, so if the word has two E\'s, it\'s possible.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.\n\nAnother word: ""EPOCH"" we considered, but in guess2 we have M and I out, but ""epoch"" has O and P and H, which are new.\n\nBut in ""epoch"": E in 1, P in 2, O in 3, C in 4, H in 5.\n\nNow, check positions:\n- E in position 1: allowed (E can be in 1,3,4)\n- C in position 4: allowed (C can be in 2,3,4)\n- Position 5: H, new letter.\n\nBut we already guessed ""medic"" and got feedback, so we can\'t reuse the same word, but ""epoch"" is different.\n\nIn terms of constraints: E in 1 is possible, C in 4 is possible.\n\nBut we have feedback that E is not in position 2 (from guess2) and not in 5 (from guess1), so position 1 is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, C not in 1 or 5, so position 4 is fine.\n\nAlso, letters: E, P, O, C, H. P, O, H are new and not excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: R,A,N,M,D,I.

""elect"" is E1,L2,E3,C4,T5. So E in 1 and 3, C in 4. But we are considering E in position 4 case, but here E is in 1 and 3, not solely in 4.\n\nFor E in position 4, we have ""OCTET"" as an example.\n\nBut let\'s go back to the options.\n\nWe have three main cases for E position: 1, 3, or 4.\n\nWith words:\n- E in 1: ""EPOCH""\n- E in 3: ""FLECK""\n- E in 4: ""OCTET"" or similar\n\nNow, we also need to consider that in position 5, it must be a new letter, and we want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nIn ""EPOCH"": tests P, O, H\nIn ""FLECK"": tests F, L, K\nIn ""OCTET"": tests O, T, but T repeated, less info.\n\n""FLECK"" seems good.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that covers more common letters.\n\nAnother word for E in position 3: ""SWEET"" no C.\n\n""CREPT"" C in 1, bad.\n\n""BLEEP"" B,L,E,E,P - E in 3 and 4? B1,L2,E3,E4,P5. But E in 3 and 4, and C missing.\n\nNo C.\n\n""CREME"" C in 1, bad.\n\nSo ""FLECK"" or ""epoch"".\n\nI think ""epoch"" is a good choice because it tests E in position 1 and C in position 4, both of which are possible, and new letters P, O, H.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLECK"" tests E in 3 and C in 4.\n\nBut position 4 for C is tested in both, but different E positions.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that can help distinguish the positions.\n\nWe know E can be in 1,3,4; C in 2,3,4.\n\nIf I guess ""epoch"":\n- If E is in position 1, we might get E(✓) and C(-) or something.\n- If E is not in 1, we get E(-) meaning E is in 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly for C.\n\nBut let\'s not overcomplicate.\n\nI think ""epoch"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and ""medic"", both with common letters.\n\n""EPOCH"" is also common.\n\nAnother word: ""CLOSE"" but C in 1, bad.\n\n""POETS"" no C.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""epoch"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback.\n\nIn guess2, we have E in position 2 which was wrong, so in ""epoch"" E is in position 1, which is new.\n\nSimilarly, C in position 4, which was not tested before (in guess1 C was position 1, in guess2 C was position 5, so position 4 is new).\n\nPosition 4 was tested in guess1 with N, which is absent, so position 4 could be C.\n\nSimilarly, position 1 was C in guess1, wrong, so could be E.\n\nSo <guess>epoch</guess>\n\nBut the format should be <guess>epoch</guess>\n\nIn the response, I need to output only the guess in that format.\n\nBut first, I should think step by step.\n\nPerhaps there is a better word.\n\nAnother word: ""BOULE"" no C.\n\n""SCULK"" no E.\n\nI think ""epoch"" is fine.\n\nOr ""FLECK"".\n\nBut ""FLECK"" has K, which is less common.\n\n""epoch"" has P, O, H, more common.\n\n""BLOCS"" no E.\n\n""COVET"" C in 1, bad.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""epoch"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: crane → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  \n  - C and E are in the word but not in positions 1 or 5, respectively.\n  - R, A, and N are not in the word.\n- **Guess 2: medic → M(x) E(-) D(x) I(x) C(-)**  \n  - E is not in position 2, and C is not in position 5.\n  - M, D, and I are not in the word.\n\n### Key Inferences:\n- **Confirmed letters in the word**: C and E.\n- **C position constraints**: Cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1) or position 5 (from Guess 2), so C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n- **E position constraints**: Cannot be in position 5 (from Guess 1) or position 2 (from Guess 2), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n- **Excluded letters**: R, A, N, M, D, I (cannot appear in the word).\n- **Position 5 constraint**: Cannot be C or E (based on feedback), so it must be a new letter.\n- **Strategy for next guess**: Test E in a new position (position 1 or 3 or 4, but not 2) and C in a new position (position 2, 3, or 4, but not 1 or 5).

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
- C is in the word, not in position 1.
- R, A, N are not in the word.
- E is in the word, not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""medic"" → Feedback: M(x) E(-) D(x) I(x) C(-)
- M, D, I are not in the word.
- E is in the word, not in position 2.
- C is in the word, not in position 5.

Guess 3: ""epoch"" → Feedback: E(-) P(✓) O(x) C(✓) H(x)
- E is in the word, not in position 1 (since E(-)).
- P is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since P is at position 2 in ""epoch"").
- O is not in the word.
- C is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since C is at position 4 in ""epoch"").
- H is not in the word.

Now, let's consolidate the information:

**Confirmed Letters:**
- P is in the word and fixed at position 2 (from ""epoch"": P(✓)).
- C is in the word and fixed at position 4 (from ""epoch"": C(✓)).
- E is in the word but not in position 1, 2, or 5. Since:
  - Not in 5 (from ""crane""),
  - Not in 2 (from ""medic""),
  - Not in 1 (from ""epoch""),
  - Therefore, E must be in position 3 (since only position 3 remains, as positions are 1 to 5).

Positions: 
- Position 1: Not E (from ""epoch"" feedback E(-), and ""epoch"" had E in pos1)
- Position 2: P (fixed)
- Position 3: ? 
- Position 4: C (fixed)
- Position 5: ? 

E must be somewhere, and from the feedback:
- Cannot be in pos1 (tested in ""epoch"")
- Cannot be in pos2 (tested in ""medic"")
- Cannot be in pos5 (tested in ""crane"")

Therefore, E must be in position 3 because that's the only position left where E could be.

Moreover, we know E is in the word from previous feedback.

**Excluded Letters:**
From all feedback, letters marked as ""x"" or absent:
- R (from ""crane"")
- A (from ""crane"")
- N (from ""crane"")
- M (from ""medic"")
- D (from ""medic"")
- I (from ""medic"")
- O (from ""epoch"")
- H (from ""epoch"")

Additionally, letters not in the word: R, A, N, M, D, I, O, H.

Now, the current known parts of the word:
- Position 1: Unknown letter, but not E and not any excluded letters.
- Position 2: P (fixed)
- Position 3: E (must be in position 3, as deduced)
- Position 4: C (fixed)
- Position 5: Unknown letter, not E (since E is in position 3), not C (as position 4 is C), and not excluded letters.

But we need to confirm: is E necessarily in position 3? Let's see:
- Positions where E can be: only 3 left, since it can't be 1,2,5. Yes.

Now, the word so far has the form: _ P E C _ 

Position 1: We need a letter that is not in the excluded list and forms a valid word.
Position 5: Similarly.

Moreover, we need to ensure no other constraints: C is fixed at 4, P at 2.

Now, what letters have not been tested? We've tested C,R,A,N,E,M,D,I,O,H,P from the guesses.

Tested letters: 
- crane: C,R,A,N,E
- medic: M,E,D,I,C → letters added: M,D,I (C,E repeated)
- epoch: E,P,O,C,H → letters added: P,O,H

So total tested: C, R, A, N, E, M, D, I, O, H, P.

Available letters: B, F, G, J, K, L, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (some less common).

Now, the word must be _ P E C _

Possible words:
- End with C? But last letter is position 5, and we have _ P E C _ , so words like ""SPEC_"", but not necessarily S.

Common words with P E C in positions 2,3,4:
Examples:
- SPECK: S P E C K → possible, as S and K not excluded.
- SPECT: not a word.
- SPELL: but L repeated, and E at 3, but C not at 4? SPELL is S,P,E,L,L → no C at position 4.
- EXPEL: but E is at position 1, and in ""epoch"" E at 1 was wrong, and position 1 here would be E? EXPEL is E,X,P,E,L → but E in position 1, which we know is not correct for E? Position 1: if E, but we know E cannot be in position 1 (from ""epoch"" E(-)), and also in this case position 1 is E, which is invalid.

We need position 1 not E.

So words: 
Position 1: consonant or vowel except E and excluded letters.

Possible words:
- SPECK: S P E C K → positions: S1, P2, E3, C4, K5. S and K not excluded.
- SPICE: but I is excluded (from ""medic"" I(x)).
- SPITE: no C.
- SPECT: not a word.
- SPECS: S P E C S → double S? Possible, but S at position 1 and 5.
- SPEAK: A excluded.
- SPEED: E in position 4? S,P,E,E,D → D excluded and no C at position 4.
- SPERM: M excluded.
- Not possible.

Other options:
- OPEC: too short.
- ASPECT: too long.
- SPEC is not 5 letters.
- Perhaps UK words, but English: SPECK, SPECS.

What about ""SPELL""? No C.

""SPERM"" M excluded.

Another word: ""SPECK"" or ""SPECS"".

""SPEW"" too short.

Perhaps not starting with S: 
- U P E C? Not common.
- Y P E C? No.
- Also, position 5 could be K, S, T, etc.

List possible endings: after PEC, so the word pattern *PEC*.

Possible English words:
- SPECS: a word, meaning specifications or spectacles.
- SPECK: a small spot or particle.
- Also, ""SPERT"" not a word.
- ""SPEED"" not matching.
- ""EXPEL"" has E at 1.
- ""ASPEN"" has A, excluded.

What about ""CHEAP"", but C not at position 4.

No, our pattern requires ""P"" at 2, ""E"" at 3, ""C"" at 4.

So: first letter and last letter.

Possible words:
- SPECK
- SPECS
- SPECY? Not a word.
- DEPEC: Not a word.

Only SPECK and SPECS seem common.

But SPECS has S at position 1 and S at position 5.

SPECK has K at position 5.

Now, S and K have not been tested yet, so they are possible.

But are there other words? For example, ""UPSET"" but no C at position 4.

Another: perhaps ""C"" as in other? C is fixed at position 4.

Perhaps ""IPECAC"" too long.

I think SPECK and SPECS are the candidates.

But SPECS: letters: S,P,E,C,S — S repeated.

But S could be present once or twice.

Similarly, SPECK: S,P,E,C,K — all distinct.

Now, regarding excluded letters: S and K not excluded.

Also, note that position 1 must not be E, and it isn't in either.

Position 5: not E or C, which is satisfied.

Now, other possibilities? 

Another word: ... 

Perhaps ""LIPEC"" not a word.

Or ""PECAN"" but P at position 1? P E C A N — A and N excluded, and P at position 1? But pattern is position 2 P, not position 1.

In our pattern, position 2 is P, so first letter can be something else.

But P is fixed at position 2, so must be: any letter at position 1, then P at 2, E at 3, C at 4, and any letter at 5.

So words starting with B, F, G, J, K, L, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but forming English words.

Examples:
- SPECK, SPECS (as above)
- B doesn't form: ""BPEC"" not.
- F: ""F"" with PEC? FPEC? Not common.
- G: ""GPEC"" no.
- J: ""JPEC"" no.
- K: ""KPEC"" no.
- L: ""L"" with PEC? Like ""LOPED"" but not matching. ""LIPEC"" no.
- S: SPECK or SPECS.
- T: ""T"" with PEC? Like ""TPEC"" no; ""SPEND"" no C.
- U: ""UP"" something; ""UPDOC"" not standard, ""UPCET"" no.
- V: ""VIPES"" no C.
- W: ""WPEC"" no.
- X: ""SPEX"" not a word; X at position 1? Like ""XPEC"" no; ""EXPEL"" has E at 1.
- Y: ""YPES"" no.
- Z: ""ZPEC"" no.

So SPECK and SPECS are the only common options.

SPECS might be less common as a word, SPECK is more straightforward.

But both are valid.

We need to guess one.

But we might have another clue: in ""crane"", C was misplaced, meaning incorrect position. But now we know C is at position 4, so that's consistent.

Similarly for other feedback.

Now, for position 1 and 5, in SPECK: position 1 S, position 5 K.

In SPECS: position 1 S, position 5 S.

We don't have feedback against S or K.

Since we have 3 guesses left (if starting from 0, but guessing 4th? We had 3 guesses so far, usually 6 tries, so we can guess).

But to decide: perhaps SPECK is better because it has distinct letters, but since SPECS has repeated S, we might get feedback indicating that.

But any is fine.

I'll go with SPECK.

But let's confirm E position: we deduced E must be in position 3.

Is there any possibility of duplicate E? For example, could E be elsewhere? But from feedback: only one E indicated, but in ""crane"", E was at position 5 and wrong; in ""medic"", E at position 2 wrong; in ""epoch"", E at position 1 wrong. So if there was another E, we might have seen it, but not necessarily. Since position 3 hasn't been tested for E explicitly, but we know E is present, and position 3 is available.

In ""epoch"", position 3 was O, which was marked x, so not present, so position 3 was not E in that guess, but E could still be there since other letters were different.

Importantly, E is not in positions 1,2,5, so only position 3 or 4, but position 4 is occupied by C, so E must be in position 3.

Position 4 is C fixed, so cannot have E there. So indeed, E must be in position 3.

Similarly, position 1 and 5 are open.

So the word is: ? P E C ?

And SPECK: S P E C K

SPECS: S P E C S

Other words? 

What about ""SPACE""? But A excluded.

""SPINE"": I excluded.

""SPORE"": O excluded? O is excluded from ""epoch"" O(x), so not.

""SPUME"": U? S P U M E — M excluded and E at position 5? Position 5 E: but E cannot be in position 5.

""SPECK"" and ""SPECS"" seem best.

Perhaps ""SPECT"" not a word.

I think SPECK is more common.

So guess ""SPECK"".

But the response format.

In summary:
- Position 1: Must be a letter not excluded and not E.
- Position 5: Must be a letter not excluded and not E or C.
- Candidates: SPECK, SPECS.

Let's go with SPECK.
</think>
Combining feedback from all guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C is not in position 1 (C(-)), E is not in position 5 (E(-)), and R, A, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (medic)**: E is not in position 2 (E(-)), C is not in position 5 (C(-)), and M, D, I are absent.
- **Guess 3 (epoch)**: P is correct in position 2 (P(✓)), C is correct in position 4 (C(✓)), E is not in position 1 (E(-)), and O, H are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Positions**: 
   - Position 2 must be P (P(✓) from epoch).
   - Position 4 must be C (C(✓) from epoch).
2. **E Position Constraints**: 
   - E cannot be in position 1 (epoch E(-)), position 2 (medic E(-)), or position 5 (crane E(-)).
   - E must be in position 3 (only remaining slot, since position 4 is fixed to C).
3. **Excluded Letters**: 
   - Absent letters: R, A, N (crane), M, D, I (medic), O, H (epoch).
   - All letters tested: C, R, A, N, E, M, D, I, O, H, P.
4. **Word Structure**: 
   - Position 1: Must be an untested letter (not E or excluded).
   - Position 3: Must be E (deduced).
   - Position 5: Must be an untested, absent letter (since E and C are fixed at other positions).
5. **Available Letters**: Untested common letters: B, F, G, K, L, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
6. **Possible Words**: 
   - The word pattern is `_ P E C _`, where the first and fifth letters must form a valid English word.
   - Common options: ""SPECK"" (S P E C K) or ""SPECS"" (S P E C S). ""SPECK"" is prioritized as it uses distinct letters, maximizing information gain.

### Strategy:
- Guess ""SPECK"" to test:
   - Position 1: S (new letter).
   - Position 5: K (new letter).
- If incorrect, the feedback on S/K helps narrow down options for position 1 and 5.

<guess>speck</guess>",speck,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
- C is in the word, not in position 1.
- R, A, N are not in the word.
- E is in the word, not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""medic"" → Feedback: M(x) E(-) D(x) I(x) C(-)
- M, D, I are not in the word.
- E is in the word, not in position 2.
- C is in the word, not in position 5.

Guess 3: ""epoch"" → Feedback: E(-) P(✓) O(x) C(✓) H(x)
- E is in the word, not in position 1 (since E(-)).
- P is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since P is at position 2 in ""epoch"").
- O is not in the word.
- C is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since C is at position 4 in ""epoch"").
- H is not in the word.

Now, let's consolidate the information:

**Confirmed Letters:**
- P is in the word and fixed at position 2 (from ""epoch"": P(✓)).
- C is in the word and fixed at position 4 (from ""epoch"": C(✓)).
- E is in the word but not in position 1, 2, or 5. Since:
  - Not in 5 (from ""crane""),
  - Not in 2 (from ""medic""),
  - Not in 1 (from ""epoch""),
  - Therefore, E must be in position 3 (since only position 3 remains, as positions are 1 to 5).

Positions: 
- Position 1: Not E (from ""epoch"" feedback E(-), and ""epoch"" had E in pos1)
- Position 2: P (fixed)
- Position 3: ? 
- Position 4: C (fixed)
- Position 5: ? 

E must be somewhere, and from the feedback:
- Cannot be in pos1 (tested in ""epoch"")
- Cannot be in pos2 (tested in ""medic"")
- Cannot be in pos5 (tested in ""crane"")

Therefore, E must be in position 3 because that's the only position left where E could be.

Moreover, we know E is in the word from previous feedback.

**Excluded Letters:**
From all feedback, letters marked as ""x"" or absent:
- R (from ""crane"")
- A (from ""crane"")
- N (from ""crane"")
- M (from ""medic"")
- D (from ""medic"")
- I (from ""medic"")
- O (from ""epoch"")
- H (from ""epoch"")

Additionally, letters not in the word: R, A, N, M, D, I, O, H.

Now, the current known parts of the word:
- Position 1: Unknown letter, but not E and not any excluded letters.
- Position 2: P (fixed)
- Position 3: E (must be in position 3, as deduced)
- Position 4: C (fixed)
- Position 5: Unknown letter, not E (since E is in position 3), not C (as position 4 is C), and not excluded letters.

But we need to confirm: is E necessarily in position 3? Let's see:
- Positions where E can be: only 3 left, since it can't be 1,2,5. Yes.

Now, the word so far has the form: _ P E C _ 

Position 1: We need a letter that is not in the excluded list and forms a valid word.
Position 5: Similarly.

Moreover, we need to ensure no other constraints: C is fixed at 4, P at 2.

Now, what letters have not been tested? We've tested C,R,A,N,E,M,D,I,O,H,P from the guesses.

Tested letters: 
- crane: C,R,A,N,E
- medic: M,E,D,I,C → letters added: M,D,I (C,E repeated)
- epoch: E,P,O,C,H → letters added: P,O,H

So total tested: C, R, A, N, E, M, D, I, O, H, P.

Available letters: B, F, G, J, K, L, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (some less common).

Now, the word must be _ P E C _

Possible words:
- End with C? But last letter is position 5, and we have _ P E C _ , so words like ""SPEC_"", but not necessarily S.

Common words with P E C in positions 2,3,4:
Examples:
- SPECK: S P E C K → possible, as S and K not excluded.
- SPECT: not a word.
- SPELL: but L repeated, and E at 3, but C not at 4? SPELL is S,P,E,L,L → no C at position 4.
- EXPEL: but E is at position 1, and in ""epoch"" E at 1 was wrong, and position 1 here would be E? EXPEL is E,X,P,E,L → but E in position 1, which we know is not correct for E? Position 1: if E, but we know E cannot be in position 1 (from ""epoch"" E(-)), and also in this case position 1 is E, which is invalid.

We need position 1 not E.

So words: 
Position 1: consonant or vowel except E and excluded letters.

Possible words:
- SPECK: S P E C K → positions: S1, P2, E3, C4, K5. S and K not excluded.
- SPICE: but I is excluded (from ""medic"" I(x)).
- SPITE: no C.
- SPECT: not a word.
- SPECS: S P E C S → double S? Possible, but S at position 1 and 5.
- SPEAK: A excluded.
- SPEED: E in position 4? S,P,E,E,D → D excluded and no C at position 4.
- SPERM: M excluded.
- Not possible.

Other options:
- OPEC: too short.
- ASPECT: too long.
- SPEC is not 5 letters.
- Perhaps UK words, but English: SPECK, SPECS.

What about ""SPELL""? No C.

""SPERM"" M excluded.

Another word: ""SPECK"" or ""SPECS"".

""SPEW"" too short.

Perhaps not starting with S: 
- U P E C? Not common.
- Y P E C? No.
- Also, position 5 could be K, S, T, etc.

List possible endings: after PEC, so the word pattern *PEC*.

Possible English words:
- SPECS: a word, meaning specifications or spectacles.
- SPECK: a small spot or particle.
- Also, ""SPERT"" not a word.
- ""SPEED"" not matching.
- ""EXPEL"" has E at 1.
- ""ASPEN"" has A, excluded.

What about ""CHEAP"", but C not at position 4.

No, our pattern requires ""P"" at 2, ""E"" at 3, ""C"" at 4.

So: first letter and last letter.

Possible words:
- SPECK
- SPECS
- SPECY? Not a word.
- DEPEC: Not a word.

Only SPECK and SPECS seem common.

But SPECS has S at position 1 and S at position 5.

SPECK has K at position 5.

Now, S and K have not been tested yet, so they are possible.

But are there other words? For example, ""UPSET"" but no C at position 4.

Another: perhaps ""C"" as in other? C is fixed at position 4.

Perhaps ""IPECAC"" too long.

I think SPECK and SPECS are the candidates.

But SPECS: letters: S,P,E,C,S — S repeated.

But S could be present once or twice.

Similarly, SPECK: S,P,E,C,K — all distinct.

Now, regarding excluded letters: S and K not excluded.

Also, note that position 1 must not be E, and it isn't in either.

Position 5: not E or C, which is satisfied.

Now, other possibilities? 

Another word: ... 

Perhaps ""LIPEC"" not a word.

Or ""PECAN"" but P at position 1? P E C A N — A and N excluded, and P at position 1? But pattern is position 2 P, not position 1.

In our pattern, position 2 is P, so first letter can be something else.

But P is fixed at position 2, so must be: any letter at position 1, then P at 2, E at 3, C at 4, and any letter at 5.

So words starting with B, F, G, J, K, L, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but forming English words.

Examples:
- SPECK, SPECS (as above)
- B doesn't form: ""BPEC"" not.
- F: ""F"" with PEC? FPEC? Not common.
- G: ""GPEC"" no.
- J: ""JPEC"" no.
- K: ""KPEC"" no.
- L: ""L"" with PEC? Like ""LOPED"" but not matching. ""LIPEC"" no.
- S: SPECK or SPECS.
- T: ""T"" with PEC? Like ""TPEC"" no; ""SPEND"" no C.
- U: ""UP"" something; ""UPDOC"" not standard, ""UPCET"" no.
- V: ""VIPES"" no C.
- W: ""WPEC"" no.
- X: ""SPEX"" not a word; X at position 1? Like ""XPEC"" no; ""EXPEL"" has E at 1.
- Y: ""YPES"" no.
- Z: ""ZPEC"" no.

So SPECK and SPECS are the only common options.

SPECS might be less common as a word, SPECK is more straightforward.

But both are valid.

We need to guess one.

But we might have another clue: in ""crane"", C was misplaced, meaning incorrect position. But now we know C is at position 4, so that's consistent.

Similarly for other feedback.

Now, for position 1 and 5, in SPECK: position 1 S, position 5 K.

In SPECS: position 1 S, position 5 S.

We don't have feedback against S or K.

Since we have 3 guesses left (if starting from 0, but guessing 4th? We had 3 guesses so far, usually 6 tries, so we can guess).

But to decide: perhaps SPECK is better because it has distinct letters, but since SPECS has repeated S, we might get feedback indicating that.

But any is fine.

I'll go with SPECK.

But let's confirm E position: we deduced E must be in position 3.

Is there any possibility of duplicate E? For example, could E be elsewhere? But from feedback: only one E indicated, but in ""crane"", E was at position 5 and wrong; in ""medic"", E at position 2 wrong; in ""epoch"", E at position 1 wrong. So if there was another E, we might have seen it, but not necessarily. Since position 3 hasn't been tested for E explicitly, but we know E is present, and position 3 is available.

In ""epoch"", position 3 was O, which was marked x, so not present, so position 3 was not E in that guess, but E could still be there since other letters were different.

Importantly, E is not in positions 1,2,5, so only position 3 or 4, but position 4 is occupied by C, so E must be in position 3.

Position 4 is C fixed, so cannot have E there. So indeed, E must be in position 3.

Similarly, position 1 and 5 are open.

So the word is: ? P E C ?

And SPECK: S P E C K

SPECS: S P E C S

Other words? 

What about ""SPACE""? But A excluded.

""SPINE"": I excluded.

""SPORE"": O excluded? O is excluded from ""epoch"" O(x), so not.

""SPUME"": U? S P U M E — M excluded and E at position 5? Position 5 E: but E cannot be in position 5.

""SPECK"" and ""SPECS"" seem best.

Perhaps ""SPECT"" not a word.

I think SPECK is more common.

So guess ""SPECK"".

But the response format.

In summary:
- Position 1: Must be a letter not excluded and not E.
- Position 5: Must be a letter not excluded and not E or C.
- Candidates: SPECK, SPECS.

Let's go with SPECK.Combining feedback from all guesses:
