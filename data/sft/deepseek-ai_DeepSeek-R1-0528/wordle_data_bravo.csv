We are at the very start of the game. We haven't received any feedback yet.
 Since there's no prior information, we want a word that gives us good coverage of common letters.
 This might help us get useful feedback about which letters are present and where they are.
 
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 Many players use words like ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"" as starting words because they have common letters.

 Let me pick one: ""RAISE"" - it has common vowels and consonants.

 Alternatively, another common starting word is ""SLATE"".

 I'll go with ""RAISE"" for now.

We are starting the game, so there's no previous feedback. For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This typically means including common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N

A good starting word like ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" covers several of these. Let's go with ""RAISE"":

- R, A, I, S, E are all common letters.
- It includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- This should help us get feedback on multiple frequent letters.

Other strong starters (like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"") are also reasonable, but ""RAISE"" is a classic choice.

We have feedback from the first guess: RAISE → R(-), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
 Interpretation:
 - R and A are in the secret word but in the wrong position (so they must be present but not in position 1 or 2 respectively).
 - I, S, and E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and A.
 - The secret word does not contain I, S, or E.
 - Since R is not in position 1, and A is not in position 2, we must place them elsewhere.

 Also, because R and A are present but misplaced, we can infer:
 - R cannot be in the first position, so it must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, but since the word is 5 letters, positions 2 to 5.
 - Similarly, A cannot be in the second position, so it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, A is in the word but not in the second position. It could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, note that in the first guess, R was in position 1 and A in position 2, and both were marked as ""-"" meaning wrong position. So:
 - R is in the word but not in position 1.
 - A is in the word but not in position 2.

 So A could be in position 1? Let's check: if A were in position 1, then in the first guess A was in position 2, which is wrong. But position 1 is open? That's possible.

 But wait, we have a constraint: if A were in position 1, then in our guess RAISE, the first letter is R, which is wrong, and A would be in position 1 of the secret? Then for the second letter (A in guess), it would be compared to position 2 of secret. Since A is actually in position 1, then for position 2 of guess, it wouldn't be A, so the feedback for A would still be ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not position 2. That's consistent.

 So A could be in position 1? However, let's think about the R: if A were in position 1, then R couldn't be in position 1, so R must be elsewhere.

 But note: the secret word must have R and A, so we must choose a word that includes R and A, but not I, S, E.

 Also, we have eliminated letters: I, S, E are out.

 What about other letters? We haven't tried many yet.

 We should choose a word that has R and A, and avoids I, S, E.

 Possible positions for R: 2,3,4,5. Similarly for A: 1,3,4,5 (avoiding position 2).

 However, note that A cannot be in 2 and R cannot be in 1.

 We need to consider which letters to try next. We have 5 new positions to cover.

 Common consonants we haven't tried: T, N, L, etc.

 Given that we have R and A, we can try a word with T or another vowel? Vowels: we have A (and we know A is present) and we tried E and I, which are out. So remaining vowels: O, U, sometimes Y. But we should avoid using E and I again.

 Also, note that we have only 6 guesses.

 What words have R and A, but no I, S, E?

 Examples: TRACK, TRACT, PARTY, CARDS, but CARDS has S which is eliminated. So avoid S.

 Let me think: 
 - Words without I, S, E: 
   Must include R and A.

 Possible: 
 - BOARD? But has O, A, R, B, D. Also, A is in position 2? But we must avoid having A in position 2? No, A cannot be in position 2? Actually, from feedback: in the guess RAISE, the A was in position 2 and was wrong. But the secret word might have A in another position, including position 1? Or anywhere else.

 Actually, position 2 in the secret word could be anything as long as it's not A? Or if A is elsewhere, then position 2 could have another letter.

 But the feedback does not say that position 2 is occupied by some other letter that also prevented A from being there? It only says A is elsewhere.

 So for the next guess, we want to:
   - Include R and A (mandatory).
   - Exclude I, S, E (since they are not in the word).
   - Place R not at position 1 and A not at position 2? Actually, we can try to put R in a different position and A in a different position? Yes.

 However, we might place A in position 1? Because that's not ruled out.

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters? We haven't checked T, O, U, L, N, C, etc.

 Let me consider: a word starting with T? Or something.

 Ideal: choose a word that has T, O, N, etc. and includes R and A but placed differently.

 Example: 
   TAROT? But has T and O, two T's? But let's see: avoids I,S,E. Includes A and R. Also positions: 
      T in position 1, A in position 2? But wait, A cannot be in position 2? Actually, we must avoid putting A in position 2? Because in the secret word, A is not in position 2? Correct.

 But in our next guess, we can put A in position 2? It wouldn't be A in the secret's position 2, but we might get feedback that A is in the word but wrong position again? Or if by chance the secret has A in position 2? Then it would be correct? But the feedback said A was wrong position in the first guess, meaning in the secret word, A is not in position 2.

 Therefore, we must not put A in position 2 in our guess? Actually, we can put A anywhere we want in the guess to test positions. But if the secret word has A not in position 2, then putting A in position 2 in our guess will yield ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Or if we put A in position 1 and it's actually in position 1, we get a checkmark.

 Similarly for R: we must not put R in position 1? Because it's wrong? But we can put R elsewhere to see if it fits.

 Actually, we must test possible positions for R and A.

 Let me list possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5 (since 2 is bad)
 For R: 2,3,4,5 (since 1 is bad)

 We need to choose a word that satisfies:
   Positions: 
        A not in 2? Actually, our guess can have A in 2, but the secret doesn't, so it will be marked ""-"". Similarly R in 1 will be marked ""-"", but we know that already so it's wasteful to put R in 1? Better to avoid using R in 1 and A in 2? So we can put them in other positions.

 However, since we are limited in letters, we might try to maximize information by testing letters we haven't tried: T, O, N, L, etc.

 I propose a word like ""ROTAN"" but that might not be common. Let's think valid words.

 Common words: 
   ""PLANT"" - has P, L, A, N, T. But does it include R? No. So not.

   ""CHART"" - has C, H, A, R, T. Positions? 
        C in 1, H in 2, A in 3, R in 4, T in 5.
        This has A in position 3 and R in position 4? Both are possible? And we avoid I,S,E.

   But does it put A and R in positions we haven't tested? And also tests C, H, T.

   Alternatively, ""PARTY"" - has P, A, R, T, Y. But A is in position 2? We shouldn't put A in position 2 because we know the secret doesn't have A in 2? Actually, we can put A in position 2 to confirm? But it will be wrong. Or we might test it? However, if we put A in position 2, it will give ""-"" for A again? Which doesn't give new information? So better to try a new position.

   We want to test A in a different position? So let's put A in 3 or 4 or 1? Similarly for R.

   So ""CHART"": A in 3, R in 4? That tests A in position 3 and R in position 4.

   Or ""TRACK"": T in 1, R in 2? But R cannot be in position 1? Well, in this guess, R is in position 2? Which is possible? Secret could have R in position 2? And A in position 3? Then positions: 
        T (position1), R (position2), A (position3), C (position4), K (position5)

   But T, C, K are new letters.

   However, note that if secret has R in position 2, then in our guess we have R in position 2? That would be correct? But we don't know.

   Actually, we want to test R in a position we haven't tried? Currently we tried R in position 1 (which was wrong). Trying R in position 2 might be useful? Because if it's correct, we get a check? But if it's still present but elsewhere (e.g., positions 3,4,5) we get ""-"".

   Similarly, for A, we tried position 2 and it was wrong. Now we can try position 3? Or 1?

   So ""TRACK"" might be a good option? But it includes K? Not the most common.

   Alternatively, ""PARTH"" might not be common? 

   Let me consider the Wordle dictionary? We need a valid English word.

   Another common word: ""CRANE"" was already used? And we know E is out? So no.

   ""SLATE"" has S and E? Both eliminated? No.

   ""TABLE""? Has E? Eliminated? Table has E? T-A-B-L-E? Yes, E. And S? No, but E is bad.

   Without E: ""ROAST"" has S? Eliminated? S is not allowed.

   So words without E,I,S: 

   A common word: ""TAROT"" is in the dictionary? But not in Wordle's list? I'm not sure.

   Another: ""ABOUT"" - does not include R? No.

   ""ALOFT"" - no R.

   ""CAROB""? Has C, A, R, O, B -> but A is in position 2? We want to avoid A in 2? Actually, let me look:

   Words that have R and A, without I,S,E: 
      TORCH? Not C,H? But TORCH: T,O,R,C,H -> no A.

   ""BRAND"" -> B,R,A,N,D. Positions: B first? A in third? So:
        Positions: B (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), D (5)

   This: 
        Places R in position 2? So if secret has R in position 2, it will be correct. If not, we get ""-"". 
        Places A in position 3? Which hasn't been tested? So we can see if A is in position 3?

   Also tests B, N, D.

   ""BRAND"" seems reasonable? But note that feedback about R: if the secret word has R in position 2, we get R(?) as check? Otherwise, if R is elsewhere, we get ""-"".

   Also, B is tested? We don't know.

   Similarly, ""CRAMP"" - C,R,A,M,P -> positions: C1,R2,A3,M4,P5 -> again R in 2 and A in 3? But C is used? Also has M and P? Both new.

   Alternatively, ""PARTY"" - P,A,R,T,Y -> A in 2? But we know A is not at 2? So A will be ""-"" again? And R in 3? Then A in 2 is bad? So if we use ""PARTY"", we have A in 2? Which we already know is wrong? So it doesn't test a new position for A? That's inefficient.

   Therefore, we want a word with A and R in positions that aren't eliminated? So avoid A in 2? And avoid R in 1?

   So positions for next guess: 
     Position 1: should not be R? Since we know R isn't there? Actually, we might test other letters? Position 1 we haven't tested? So we can put a new letter in 1? And put A and R in positions 3,4, or 5? Avoiding 2 for A and 1 for R.

   Let me try to build: 
        Letter1: new letter? Not E,I,S,R? 
        Letter2: cannot be A? So new letter? And not E,I,S? 
        Letter3: could be A? or R?
        Letter4: could be A? or R? 
        Letter5: could be a new letter?

   Example: 
        ""TOUR"" -> not 5 letters.

        ""HORNY"" -> no A.

        ""PLAIN"" -> has I? And we know I is out.

        ""LAYUP"" -> not in dictionary? 

        ""CARTY""? Not a word.

   How about ""PARTY"" but move the positions? But that's rearranged to ""PRAT"" (not 5). 

   Another idea: ""CARVE"" -> has E? Eliminated? E is out.

   ""MANOR"" -> M,A,N,O,R: positions: M1, A2? But we avoid position 2 for A? So A is in 2? Which is bad? We put A in 2? That's okay? We'll get ""-"" for A? But we already know that? So putting A in 2 uses up a slot? We want to test new positions? 

   We have limited guesses? Try to test A in a new position? For instance, position 1?

   Word with A at position 1? 
        ""AUDIO"" -> eliminated letters? Has I? And we know I is out? Also not including R? 

        ""ALERT"" -> has E? Eliminated?

        ""ABHOR"" -> A,B,H,O,R -> positions: A(1), B(2), H(3), O(4), R(5)
     This: 
        Puts A in position 1? That's a new position? We never tested position 1 for A? 
        Puts R in position 5? Also new? We had R in 1? Now in 5? 
        Avoids I, S, E.

     Also tests letters: B, H, O.

     But is ""ABHOR"" a common word? It might be accepted? 

     Alternatively, ""ANVIL"" has I? And V? But I is bad.

     ""ADORE"" -> has E? Bad.

     Without E and I: ""ABOIL""? Contains I? 

     Another word: ""ACORN"" -> A,C,O,R,N -> positions: A(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)
        This has A in 1, R in 4? And tests C, O, N? 
        Avoids E,I,S.

        So ""ACORN"" might be a good choice.

     What about ""ALARM"" -> has A,L,A,R,M? But duplicate A? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But Wordle allows duplicates? Actually, Wordle words can have duplicates? But not often? We haven't ruled out duplicates? But no clues so far.

     Actually, the feedback for RAISE: we had R and A and no duplicates? So the secret might have duplicates? Not necessarily? But for information, we avoid duplicates? 

     ""ACORN"": A, C, O, R, N - all unique.

     Similarly, ""ABHOR"": A,B,H,O,R - unique.

     I think both are valid. I'll choose ""ACORN"".

   Why ""ACORN""?
        Tests A in position 1 (new, we haven't tried) -> if it's correct, then ✓, else if A is present but not 1, then ""-"". 
        Tests R in position 4? We haven't tried that? Previously R was in 1? Now in 4? 
        Tests C, O, N? All common letters.

   Also, note that we avoid E,I,S? Covered.

   So let's go with ""ACORN"".

   Alternative: ""AUDIO"" is bad? Has I? 

   So ""ACORN"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R and A are present in the secret word but misplaced (so R is not in position 1, and A is not in position 2).
- I, S, and E are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess, we need to:
1. Include both R and A, as they are confirmed to be in the word.
2. Avoid I, S, and E entirely.
3. Test new positions for R and A to gather more locational clues.
4. Introduce new common letters (like C, O, N) to maximize information.

The word ""ACORN"" fits perfectly:
- Places A in position 1 (never tested before) → could reveal if A belongs at the start or is misplaced.
- Places R in position 4 (unexplored position) → tests a new slot.
- Introduces C (position 2), O (position 3), and N (position 5) → valuable new letters.
- Excludes forbidden letters (I, S, E) and adheres to length.

<guess>ACORN</guess>",ACORN,"We have feedback from the first guess: RAISE → R(-), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
 Interpretation:
 - R and A are in the secret word but in the wrong position (so they must be present but not in position 1 or 2 respectively).
 - I, S, and E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and A.
 - The secret word does not contain I, S, or E.
 - Since R is not in position 1, and A is not in position 2, we must place them elsewhere.

 Also, because R and A are present but misplaced, we can infer:
 - R cannot be in the first position, so it must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, but since the word is 5 letters, positions 2 to 5.
 - Similarly, A cannot be in the second position, so it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, A is in the word but not in the second position. It could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, note that in the first guess, R was in position 1 and A in position 2, and both were marked as ""-"" meaning wrong position. So:
 - R is in the word but not in position 1.
 - A is in the word but not in position 2.

 So A could be in position 1? Let's check: if A were in position 1, then in the first guess A was in position 2, which is wrong. But position 1 is open? That's possible.

 But wait, we have a constraint: if A were in position 1, then in our guess RAISE, the first letter is R, which is wrong, and A would be in position 1 of the secret? Then for the second letter (A in guess), it would be compared to position 2 of secret. Since A is actually in position 1, then for position 2 of guess, it wouldn't be A, so the feedback for A would still be ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not position 2. That's consistent.

 So A could be in position 1? However, let's think about the R: if A were in position 1, then R couldn't be in position 1, so R must be elsewhere.

 But note: the secret word must have R and A, so we must choose a word that includes R and A, but not I, S, E.

 Also, we have eliminated letters: I, S, E are out.

 What about other letters? We haven't tried many yet.

 We should choose a word that has R and A, and avoids I, S, E.

 Possible positions for R: 2,3,4,5. Similarly for A: 1,3,4,5 (avoiding position 2).

 However, note that A cannot be in 2 and R cannot be in 1.

 We need to consider which letters to try next. We have 5 new positions to cover.

 Common consonants we haven't tried: T, N, L, etc.

 Given that we have R and A, we can try a word with T or another vowel? Vowels: we have A (and we know A is present) and we tried E and I, which are out. So remaining vowels: O, U, sometimes Y. But we should avoid using E and I again.

 Also, note that we have only 6 guesses.

 What words have R and A, but no I, S, E?

 Examples: TRACK, TRACT, PARTY, CARDS, but CARDS has S which is eliminated. So avoid S.

 Let me think: 
 - Words without I, S, E: 
   Must include R and A.

 Possible: 
 - BOARD? But has O, A, R, B, D. Also, A is in position 2? But we must avoid having A in position 2? No, A cannot be in position 2? Actually, from feedback: in the guess RAISE, the A was in position 2 and was wrong. But the secret word might have A in another position, including position 1? Or anywhere else.

 Actually, position 2 in the secret word could be anything as long as it's not A? Or if A is elsewhere, then position 2 could have another letter.

 But the feedback does not say that position 2 is occupied by some other letter that also prevented A from being there? It only says A is elsewhere.

 So for the next guess, we want to:
   - Include R and A (mandatory).
   - Exclude I, S, E (since they are not in the word).
   - Place R not at position 1 and A not at position 2? Actually, we can try to put R in a different position and A in a different position? Yes.

 However, we might place A in position 1? Because that's not ruled out.

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters? We haven't checked T, O, U, L, N, C, etc.

 Let me consider: a word starting with T? Or something.

 Ideal: choose a word that has T, O, N, etc. and includes R and A but placed differently.

 Example: 
   TAROT? But has T and O, two T's? But let's see: avoids I,S,E. Includes A and R. Also positions: 
      T in position 1, A in position 2? But wait, A cannot be in position 2? Actually, we must avoid putting A in position 2? Because in the secret word, A is not in position 2? Correct.

 But in our next guess, we can put A in position 2? It wouldn't be A in the secret's position 2, but we might get feedback that A is in the word but wrong position again? Or if by chance the secret has A in position 2? Then it would be correct? But the feedback said A was wrong position in the first guess, meaning in the secret word, A is not in position 2.

 Therefore, we must not put A in position 2 in our guess? Actually, we can put A anywhere we want in the guess to test positions. But if the secret word has A not in position 2, then putting A in position 2 in our guess will yield ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Or if we put A in position 1 and it's actually in position 1, we get a checkmark.

 Similarly for R: we must not put R in position 1? Because it's wrong? But we can put R elsewhere to see if it fits.

 Actually, we must test possible positions for R and A.

 Let me list possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5 (since 2 is bad)
 For R: 2,3,4,5 (since 1 is bad)

 We need to choose a word that satisfies:
   Positions: 
        A not in 2? Actually, our guess can have A in 2, but the secret doesn't, so it will be marked ""-"". Similarly R in 1 will be marked ""-"", but we know that already so it's wasteful to put R in 1? Better to avoid using R in 1 and A in 2? So we can put them in other positions.

 However, since we are limited in letters, we might try to maximize information by testing letters we haven't tried: T, O, N, L, etc.

 I propose a word like ""ROTAN"" but that might not be common. Let's think valid words.

 Common words: 
   ""PLANT"" - has P, L, A, N, T. But does it include R? No. So not.

   ""CHART"" - has C, H, A, R, T. Positions? 
        C in 1, H in 2, A in 3, R in 4, T in 5.
        This has A in position 3 and R in position 4? Both are possible? And we avoid I,S,E.

   But does it put A and R in positions we haven't tested? And also tests C, H, T.

   Alternatively, ""PARTY"" - has P, A, R, T, Y. But A is in position 2? We shouldn't put A in position 2 because we know the secret doesn't have A in 2? Actually, we can put A in position 2 to confirm? But it will be wrong. Or we might test it? However, if we put A in position 2, it will give ""-"" for A again? Which doesn't give new information? So better to try a new position.

   We want to test A in a different position? So let's put A in 3 or 4 or 1? Similarly for R.

   So ""CHART"": A in 3, R in 4? That tests A in position 3 and R in position 4.

   Or ""TRACK"": T in 1, R in 2? But R cannot be in position 1? Well, in this guess, R is in position 2? Which is possible? Secret could have R in position 2? And A in position 3? Then positions: 
        T (position1), R (position2), A (position3), C (position4), K (position5)

   But T, C, K are new letters.

   However, note that if secret has R in position 2, then in our guess we have R in position 2? That would be correct? But we don't know.

   Actually, we want to test R in a position we haven't tried? Currently we tried R in position 1 (which was wrong). Trying R in position 2 might be useful? Because if it's correct, we get a check? But if it's still present but elsewhere (e.g., positions 3,4,5) we get ""-"".

   Similarly, for A, we tried position 2 and it was wrong. Now we can try position 3? Or 1?

   So ""TRACK"" might be a good option? But it includes K? Not the most common.

   Alternatively, ""PARTH"" might not be common? 

   Let me consider the Wordle dictionary? We need a valid English word.

   Another common word: ""CRANE"" was already used? And we know E is out? So no.

   ""SLATE"" has S and E? Both eliminated? No.

   ""TABLE""? Has E? Eliminated? Table has E? T-A-B-L-E? Yes, E. And S? No, but E is bad.

   Without E: ""ROAST"" has S? Eliminated? S is not allowed.

   So words without E,I,S: 

   A common word: ""TAROT"" is in the dictionary? But not in Wordle's list? I'm not sure.

   Another: ""ABOUT"" - does not include R? No.

   ""ALOFT"" - no R.

   ""CAROB""? Has C, A, R, O, B -> but A is in position 2? We want to avoid A in 2? Actually, let me look:

   Words that have R and A, without I,S,E: 
      TORCH? Not C,H? But TORCH: T,O,R,C,H -> no A.

   ""BRAND"" -> B,R,A,N,D. Positions: B first? A in third? So:
        Positions: B (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), D (5)

   This: 
        Places R in position 2? So if secret has R in position 2, it will be correct. If not, we get ""-"". 
        Places A in position 3? Which hasn't been tested? So we can see if A is in position 3?

   Also tests B, N, D.

   ""BRAND"" seems reasonable? But note that feedback about R: if the secret word has R in position 2, we get R(?) as check? Otherwise, if R is elsewhere, we get ""-"".

   Also, B is tested? We don't know.

   Similarly, ""CRAMP"" - C,R,A,M,P -> positions: C1,R2,A3,M4,P5 -> again R in 2 and A in 3? But C is used? Also has M and P? Both new.

   Alternatively, ""PARTY"" - P,A,R,T,Y -> A in 2? But we know A is not at 2? So A will be ""-"" again? And R in 3? Then A in 2 is bad? So if we use ""PARTY"", we have A in 2? Which we already know is wrong? So it doesn't test a new position for A? That's inefficient.

   Therefore, we want a word with A and R in positions that aren't eliminated? So avoid A in 2? And avoid R in 1?

   So positions for next guess: 
     Position 1: should not be R? Since we know R isn't there? Actually, we might test other letters? Position 1 we haven't tested? So we can put a new letter in 1? And put A and R in positions 3,4, or 5? Avoiding 2 for A and 1 for R.

   Let me try to build: 
        Letter1: new letter? Not E,I,S,R? 
        Letter2: cannot be A? So new letter? And not E,I,S? 
        Letter3: could be A? or R?
        Letter4: could be A? or R? 
        Letter5: could be a new letter?

   Example: 
        ""TOUR"" -> not 5 letters.

        ""HORNY"" -> no A.

        ""PLAIN"" -> has I? And we know I is out.

        ""LAYUP"" -> not in dictionary? 

        ""CARTY""? Not a word.

   How about ""PARTY"" but move the positions? But that's rearranged to ""PRAT"" (not 5). 

   Another idea: ""CARVE"" -> has E? Eliminated? E is out.

   ""MANOR"" -> M,A,N,O,R: positions: M1, A2? But we avoid position 2 for A? So A is in 2? Which is bad? We put A in 2? That's okay? We'll get ""-"" for A? But we already know that? So putting A in 2 uses up a slot? We want to test new positions? 

   We have limited guesses? Try to test A in a new position? For instance, position 1?

   Word with A at position 1? 
        ""AUDIO"" -> eliminated letters? Has I? And we know I is out? Also not including R? 

        ""ALERT"" -> has E? Eliminated?

        ""ABHOR"" -> A,B,H,O,R -> positions: A(1), B(2), H(3), O(4), R(5)
     This: 
        Puts A in position 1? That's a new position? We never tested position 1 for A? 
        Puts R in position 5? Also new? We had R in 1? Now in 5? 
        Avoids I, S, E.

     Also tests letters: B, H, O.

     But is ""ABHOR"" a common word? It might be accepted? 

     Alternatively, ""ANVIL"" has I? And V? But I is bad.

     ""ADORE"" -> has E? Bad.

     Without E and I: ""ABOIL""? Contains I? 

     Another word: ""ACORN"" -> A,C,O,R,N -> positions: A(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)
        This has A in 1, R in 4? And tests C, O, N? 
        Avoids E,I,S.

        So ""ACORN"" might be a good choice.

     What about ""ALARM"" -> has A,L,A,R,M? But duplicate A? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But Wordle allows duplicates? Actually, Wordle words can have duplicates? But not often? We haven't ruled out duplicates? But no clues so far.

     Actually, the feedback for RAISE: we had R and A and no duplicates? So the secret might have duplicates? Not necessarily? But for information, we avoid duplicates? 

     ""ACORN"": A, C, O, R, N - all unique.

     Similarly, ""ABHOR"": A,B,H,O,R - unique.

     I think both are valid. I'll choose ""ACORN"".

   Why ""ACORN""?
        Tests A in position 1 (new, we haven't tried) -> if it's correct, then ✓, else if A is present but not 1, then ""-"". 
        Tests R in position 4? We haven't tried that? Previously R was in 1? Now in 4? 
        Tests C, O, N? All common letters.

   Also, note that we avoid E,I,S? Covered.

   So let's go with ""ACORN"".

   Alternative: ""AUDIO"" is bad? Has I? 

   So ""ACORN"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R and A are present in the secret word but misplaced (so R is not in position 1, and A is not in position 2).
- I, S, and E are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess, we need to:
1. Include both R and A, as they are confirmed to be in the word.
2. Avoid I, S, and E entirely.
3. Test new positions for R and A to gather more locational clues.
4. Introduce new common letters (like C, O, N) to maximize information.

The word ""ACORN"" fits perfectly:
- Places A in position 1 (never tested before) → could reveal if A belongs at the start or is misplaced.
- Places R in position 4 (unexplored position) → tests a new slot.
- Introduces C (position 2), O (position 3), and N (position 5) → valuable new letters.
- Excludes forbidden letters (I, S, E) and adheres to length.",Guess 2: ACORN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,bravo,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are at the very start of the game. We haven't received any feedback yet.
 Since there's no prior information, we want a word that gives us good coverage of common letters.
 This might help us get useful feedback about which letters are present and where they are.
 
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 Many players use words like ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"" as starting words because they have common letters.

 Let me pick one: ""RAISE"" - it has common vowels and consonants.

 Alternatively, another common starting word is ""SLATE"".

 I'll go with ""RAISE"" for now.<thinking>
We are starting the game, so there's no previous feedback. For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This typically means including common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N

A good starting word like ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" covers several of these. Let's go with ""RAISE"":

- R, A, I, S, E are all common letters.
- It includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- This should help us get feedback on multiple frequent letters.

Other strong starters (like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"") are also reasonable, but ""RAISE"" is a classic choice.
</thinking>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: RAISE → R(-), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
 Interpretation:
 - R and A are in the secret word but in the wrong position (so they must be present but not in position 1 or 2 respectively).
 - I, S, and E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and A.
 - The secret word does not contain I, S, or E.
 - Since R is not in position 1, and A is not in position 2, we must place them elsewhere.

 Also, because R and A are present but misplaced, we can infer:
 - R cannot be in the first position, so it must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, but since the word is 5 letters, positions 2 to 5.
 - Similarly, A cannot be in the second position, so it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, A is in the word but not in the second position. It could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, note that in the first guess, R was in position 1 and A in position 2, and both were marked as ""-"" meaning wrong position. So:
 - R is in the word but not in position 1.
 - A is in the word but not in position 2.

 So A could be in position 1? Let's check: if A were in position 1, then in the first guess A was in position 2, which is wrong. But position 1 is open? That's possible.

 But wait, we have a constraint: if A were in position 1, then in our guess RAISE, the first letter is R, which is wrong, and A would be in position 1 of the secret? Then for the second letter (A in guess), it would be compared to position 2 of secret. Since A is actually in position 1, then for position 2 of guess, it wouldn't be A, so the feedback for A would still be ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not position 2. That's consistent.

 So A could be in position 1? However, let's think about the R: if A were in position 1, then R couldn't be in position 1, so R must be elsewhere.

 But note: the secret word must have R and A, so we must choose a word that includes R and A, but not I, S, E.

 Also, we have eliminated letters: I, S, E are out.

 What about other letters? We haven't tried many yet.

 We should choose a word that has R and A, and avoids I, S, E.

 Possible positions for R: 2,3,4,5. Similarly for A: 1,3,4,5 (avoiding position 2).

 However, note that A cannot be in 2 and R cannot be in 1.

 We need to consider which letters to try next. We have 5 new positions to cover.

 Common consonants we haven't tried: T, N, L, etc.

 Given that we have R and A, we can try a word with T or another vowel? Vowels: we have A (and we know A is present) and we tried E and I, which are out. So remaining vowels: O, U, sometimes Y. But we should avoid using E and I again.

 Also, note that we have only 6 guesses.

 What words have R and A, but no I, S, E?

 Examples: TRACK, TRACT, PARTY, CARDS, but CARDS has S which is eliminated. So avoid S.

 Let me think: 
 - Words without I, S, E: 
   Must include R and A.

 Possible: 
 - BOARD? But has O, A, R, B, D. Also, A is in position 2? But we must avoid having A in position 2? No, A cannot be in position 2? Actually, from feedback: in the guess RAISE, the A was in position 2 and was wrong. But the secret word might have A in another position, including position 1? Or anywhere else.

 Actually, position 2 in the secret word could be anything as long as it's not A? Or if A is elsewhere, then position 2 could have another letter.

 But the feedback does not say that position 2 is occupied by some other letter that also prevented A from being there? It only says A is elsewhere.

 So for the next guess, we want to:
   - Include R and A (mandatory).
   - Exclude I, S, E (since they are not in the word).
   - Place R not at position 1 and A not at position 2? Actually, we can try to put R in a different position and A in a different position? Yes.

 However, we might place A in position 1? Because that's not ruled out.

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters? We haven't checked T, O, U, L, N, C, etc.

 Let me consider: a word starting with T? Or something.

 Ideal: choose a word that has T, O, N, etc. and includes R and A but placed differently.

 Example: 
   TAROT? But has T and O, two T's? But let's see: avoids I,S,E. Includes A and R. Also positions: 
      T in position 1, A in position 2? But wait, A cannot be in position 2? Actually, we must avoid putting A in position 2? Because in the secret word, A is not in position 2? Correct.

 But in our next guess, we can put A in position 2? It wouldn't be A in the secret's position 2, but we might get feedback that A is in the word but wrong position again? Or if by chance the secret has A in position 2? Then it would be correct? But the feedback said A was wrong position in the first guess, meaning in the secret word, A is not in position 2.

 Therefore, we must not put A in position 2 in our guess? Actually, we can put A anywhere we want in the guess to test positions. But if the secret word has A not in position 2, then putting A in position 2 in our guess will yield ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Or if we put A in position 1 and it's actually in position 1, we get a checkmark.

 Similarly for R: we must not put R in position 1? Because it's wrong? But we can put R elsewhere to see if it fits.

 Actually, we must test possible positions for R and A.

 Let me list possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5 (since 2 is bad)
 For R: 2,3,4,5 (since 1 is bad)

 We need to choose a word that satisfies:
   Positions: 
        A not in 2? Actually, our guess can have A in 2, but the secret doesn't, so it will be marked ""-"". Similarly R in 1 will be marked ""-"", but we know that already so it's wasteful to put R in 1? Better to avoid using R in 1 and A in 2? So we can put them in other positions.

 However, since we are limited in letters, we might try to maximize information by testing letters we haven't tried: T, O, N, L, etc.

 I propose a word like ""ROTAN"" but that might not be common. Let's think valid words.

 Common words: 
   ""PLANT"" - has P, L, A, N, T. But does it include R? No. So not.

   ""CHART"" - has C, H, A, R, T. Positions? 
        C in 1, H in 2, A in 3, R in 4, T in 5.
        This has A in position 3 and R in position 4? Both are possible? And we avoid I,S,E.

   But does it put A and R in positions we haven't tested? And also tests C, H, T.

   Alternatively, ""PARTY"" - has P, A, R, T, Y. But A is in position 2? We shouldn't put A in position 2 because we know the secret doesn't have A in 2? Actually, we can put A in position 2 to confirm? But it will be wrong. Or we might test it? However, if we put A in position 2, it will give ""-"" for A again? Which doesn't give new information? So better to try a new position.

   We want to test A in a different position? So let's put A in 3 or 4 or 1? Similarly for R.

   So ""CHART"": A in 3, R in 4? That tests A in position 3 and R in position 4.

   Or ""TRACK"": T in 1, R in 2? But R cannot be in position 1? Well, in this guess, R is in position 2? Which is possible? Secret could have R in position 2? And A in position 3? Then positions: 
        T (position1), R (position2), A (position3), C (position4), K (position5)

   But T, C, K are new letters.

   However, note that if secret has R in position 2, then in our guess we have R in position 2? That would be correct? But we don't know.

   Actually, we want to test R in a position we haven't tried? Currently we tried R in position 1 (which was wrong). Trying R in position 2 might be useful? Because if it's correct, we get a check? But if it's still present but elsewhere (e.g., positions 3,4,5) we get ""-"".

   Similarly, for A, we tried position 2 and it was wrong. Now we can try position 3? Or 1?

   So ""TRACK"" might be a good option? But it includes K? Not the most common.

   Alternatively, ""PARTH"" might not be common? 

   Let me consider the Wordle dictionary? We need a valid English word.

   Another common word: ""CRANE"" was already used? And we know E is out? So no.

   ""SLATE"" has S and E? Both eliminated? No.

   ""TABLE""? Has E? Eliminated? Table has E? T-A-B-L-E? Yes, E. And S? No, but E is bad.

   Without E: ""ROAST"" has S? Eliminated? S is not allowed.

   So words without E,I,S: 

   A common word: ""TAROT"" is in the dictionary? But not in Wordle's list? I'm not sure.

   Another: ""ABOUT"" - does not include R? No.

   ""ALOFT"" - no R.

   ""CAROB""? Has C, A, R, O, B -> but A is in position 2? We want to avoid A in 2? Actually, let me look:

   Words that have R and A, without I,S,E: 
      TORCH? Not C,H? But TORCH: T,O,R,C,H -> no A.

   ""BRAND"" -> B,R,A,N,D. Positions: B first? A in third? So:
        Positions: B (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), D (5)

   This: 
        Places R in position 2? So if secret has R in position 2, it will be correct. If not, we get ""-"". 
        Places A in position 3? Which hasn't been tested? So we can see if A is in position 3?

   Also tests B, N, D.

   ""BRAND"" seems reasonable? But note that feedback about R: if the secret word has R in position 2, we get R(?) as check? Otherwise, if R is elsewhere, we get ""-"".

   Also, B is tested? We don't know.

   Similarly, ""CRAMP"" - C,R,A,M,P -> positions: C1,R2,A3,M4,P5 -> again R in 2 and A in 3? But C is used? Also has M and P? Both new.

   Alternatively, ""PARTY"" - P,A,R,T,Y -> A in 2? But we know A is not at 2? So A will be ""-"" again? And R in 3? Then A in 2 is bad? So if we use ""PARTY"", we have A in 2? Which we already know is wrong? So it doesn't test a new position for A? That's inefficient.

   Therefore, we want a word with A and R in positions that aren't eliminated? So avoid A in 2? And avoid R in 1?

   So positions for next guess: 
     Position 1: should not be R? Since we know R isn't there? Actually, we might test other letters? Position 1 we haven't tested? So we can put a new letter in 1? And put A and R in positions 3,4, or 5? Avoiding 2 for A and 1 for R.

   Let me try to build: 
        Letter1: new letter? Not E,I,S,R? 
        Letter2: cannot be A? So new letter? And not E,I,S? 
        Letter3: could be A? or R?
        Letter4: could be A? or R? 
        Letter5: could be a new letter?

   Example: 
        ""TOUR"" -> not 5 letters.

        ""HORNY"" -> no A.

        ""PLAIN"" -> has I? And we know I is out.

        ""LAYUP"" -> not in dictionary? 

        ""CARTY""? Not a word.

   How about ""PARTY"" but move the positions? But that's rearranged to ""PRAT"" (not 5). 

   Another idea: ""CARVE"" -> has E? Eliminated? E is out.

   ""MANOR"" -> M,A,N,O,R: positions: M1, A2? But we avoid position 2 for A? So A is in 2? Which is bad? We put A in 2? That's okay? We'll get ""-"" for A? But we already know that? So putting A in 2 uses up a slot? We want to test new positions? 

   We have limited guesses? Try to test A in a new position? For instance, position 1?

   Word with A at position 1? 
        ""AUDIO"" -> eliminated letters? Has I? And we know I is out? Also not including R? 

        ""ALERT"" -> has E? Eliminated?

        ""ABHOR"" -> A,B,H,O,R -> positions: A(1), B(2), H(3), O(4), R(5)
     This: 
        Puts A in position 1? That's a new position? We never tested position 1 for A? 
        Puts R in position 5? Also new? We had R in 1? Now in 5? 
        Avoids I, S, E.

     Also tests letters: B, H, O.

     But is ""ABHOR"" a common word? It might be accepted? 

     Alternatively, ""ANVIL"" has I? And V? But I is bad.

     ""ADORE"" -> has E? Bad.

     Without E and I: ""ABOIL""? Contains I? 

     Another word: ""ACORN"" -> A,C,O,R,N -> positions: A(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)
        This has A in 1, R in 4? And tests C, O, N? 
        Avoids E,I,S.

        So ""ACORN"" might be a good choice.

     What about ""ALARM"" -> has A,L,A,R,M? But duplicate A? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But Wordle allows duplicates? Actually, Wordle words can have duplicates? But not often? We haven't ruled out duplicates? But no clues so far.

     Actually, the feedback for RAISE: we had R and A and no duplicates? So the secret might have duplicates? Not necessarily? But for information, we avoid duplicates? 

     ""ACORN"": A, C, O, R, N - all unique.

     Similarly, ""ABHOR"": A,B,H,O,R - unique.

     I think both are valid. I'll choose ""ACORN"".

   Why ""ACORN""?
        Tests A in position 1 (new, we haven't tried) -> if it's correct, then ✓, else if A is present but not 1, then ""-"". 
        Tests R in position 4? We haven't tried that? Previously R was in 1? Now in 4? 
        Tests C, O, N? All common letters.

   Also, note that we avoid E,I,S? Covered.

   So let's go with ""ACORN"".

   Alternative: ""AUDIO"" is bad? Has I? 

   So ""ACORN"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R and A are present in the secret word but misplaced (so R is not in position 1, and A is not in position 2).
- I, S, and E are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess, we need to:
1. Include both R and A, as they are confirmed to be in the word.
2. Avoid I, S, and E entirely.
3. Test new positions for R and A to gather more locational clues.
4. Introduce new common letters (like C, O, N) to maximize information.

The word ""ACORN"" fits perfectly:
- Places A in position 1 (never tested before) → could reveal if A belongs at the start or is misplaced.
- Places R in position 4 (unexplored position) → tests a new slot.
- Introduces C (position 2), O (position 3), and N (position 5) → valuable new letters.
- Excludes forbidden letters (I, S, E) and adheres to length.

Actually, A is in the word but not in the second position. It could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n However, note that in the first guess, R was in position 1 and A in position 2, and both were marked as ""-"" meaning wrong position. So:\n - R is in the word but not in position 1.\n - A is in the word but not in position 2.\n\n So A could be in position 1? Let\'s check: if A were in position 1, then in the first guess A was in position 2, which is wrong. But position 1 is open? That\'s possible.\n\n But wait, we have a constraint: if A were in position 1, then in our guess RAISE, the first letter is R, which is wrong, and A would be in position 1 of the secret? Then for the second letter (A in guess), it would be compared to position 2 of secret. Since A is actually in position 1, then for position 2 of guess, it wouldn\'t be A, so the feedback for A would still be ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but not position 2. That\'s consistent.\n\n So A could be in position 1? However, let\'s think about the R: if A were in position 1, then R couldn\'t be in position 1, so R must be elsewhere.\n\n But note: the secret word must have R and A, so we must choose a word that includes R and A, but not I, S, E.\n\n Also, we have eliminated letters: I, S, E are out.\n\n What about other letters? We haven\'t tried many yet.\n\n We should choose a word that has R and A, and avoids I, S, E.\n\n Possible positions for R: 2,3,4,5. Similarly for A: 1,3,4,5 (avoiding position 2).\n\n However, note that A cannot be in 2 and R cannot be in 1.\n\n We need to consider which letters to try next. We have 5 new positions to cover.\n\n Common consonants we haven\'t tried: T, N, L, etc.\n\n Given that we have R and A, we can try a word with T or another vowel? Vowels: we have A (and we know A is present) and we tried E and I, which are out. So remaining vowels: O, U, sometimes Y. But we should avoid using E and I again.\n\n Also, note that we have only 6 guesses.\n\n What words have R and A, but no I, S, E?\n\n Examples: TRACK, TRACT, PARTY, CARDS, but CARDS has S which is eliminated. So avoid S.\n\n Let me think: \n - Words without I, S, E: \n   Must include R and A.\n\n Possible: \n - BOARD? But has O, A, R, B, D. Also, A is in position 2? But we must avoid having A in position 2? No, A cannot be in position 2? Actually, from feedback: in the guess RAISE, the A was in position 2 and was wrong. But the secret word might have A in another position, including position 1? Or anywhere else.\n\n Actually, position 2 in the secret word could be anything as long as it\'s not A? Or if A is elsewhere, then position 2 could have another letter.\n\n But the feedback does not say that position 2 is occupied by some other letter that also prevented A from being there? It only says A is elsewhere.\n\n So for the next guess, we want to:\n   - Include R and A (mandatory).\n   - Exclude I, S, E (since they are not in the word).\n   - Place R not at position 1 and A not at position 2? Actually, we can try to put R in a different position and A in a different position? Yes.\n\n However, we might place A in position 1? Because that\'s not ruled out.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters? We haven\'t checked T, O, U, L, N, C, etc.\n\n Let me consider: a word starting with T? Or something.\n\n Ideal: choose a word that has T, O, N, etc. and includes R and A but placed differently.\n\n Example: \n   TAROT? But has T and O, two T\'s? But let\'s see: avoids I,S,E. Includes A and R. Also positions: \n      T in position 1, A in position 2? But wait, A cannot be in position 2? Actually, we must avoid putting A in position 2? Because in the secret word, A is not in position 2? Correct.\n\n But in our next guess, we can put A in position 2? It wouldn\'t be A in the secret\'s position 2, but we might get feedback that A is in the word but wrong position again? Or if by chance the secret has A in position 2? Then it would be correct? But the feedback said A was wrong position in the first guess, meaning in the secret word, A is not in position 2.\n\n Therefore, we must not put A in position 2 in our guess? Actually, we can put A anywhere we want in the guess to test positions. But if the secret word has A not in position 2, then putting A in position 2 in our guess will yield ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Or if we put A in position 1 and it\'s actually in position 1, we get a checkmark.\n\n Similarly for R: we must not put R in position 1? Because it\'s wrong? But we can put R elsewhere to see if it fits.\n\n Actually, we must test possible positions for R and A.\n\n Let me list possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5 (since 2 is bad)\n For R: 2,3,4,5 (since 1 is bad)\n\n We need to choose a word that satisfies:\n   Positions: \n        A not in 2? Actually, our guess can have A in 2, but the secret doesn\'t, so it will be marked ""-"". Similarly R in 1 will be marked ""-"", but we know that already so it\'s wasteful to put R in 1? Better to avoid using R in 1 and A in 2? So we can put them in other positions.\n\n However, since we are limited in letters, we might try to maximize information by testing letters we haven\'t tried: T, O, N, L, etc.\n\n I propose a word like ""ROTAN"" but that might not be common. Let\'s think valid words.\n\n Common words: \n   ""PLANT"" - has P, L, A, N, T. But does it include R? No. So not.\n\n   ""CHART"" - has C, H, A, R, T. Positions? \n        C in 1, H in 2, A in 3, R in 4, T in 5.\n        This has A in position 3 and R in position 4? Both are possible? And we avoid I,S,E.\n\n   But does it put A and R in positions we haven\'t tested? And also tests C, H, T.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PARTY"" - has P, A, R, T, Y. But A is in position 2? We shouldn\'t put A in position 2 because we know the secret doesn\'t have A in 2? Actually, we can put A in position 2 to confirm? But it will be wrong. Or we might test it? However, if we put A in position 2, it will give ""-"" for A again? Which doesn\'t give new information? So better to try a new position.\n\n   We want to test A in a different position? So let\'s put A in 3 or 4 or 1? Similarly for R.\n\n   So ""CHART"": A in 3, R in 4? That tests A in position 3 and R in position 4.\n\n   Or ""TRACK"": T in 1, R in 2? But R cannot be in position 1? Well, in this guess, R is in position 2? Which is possible? Secret could have R in position 2? And A in position 3? Then positions: \n        T (position1), R (position2), A (position3), C (position4), K (position5)\n\n   But T, C, K are new letters.\n\n   However, note that if secret has R in position 2, then in our guess we have R in position 2? That would be correct? But we don\'t know.\n\n   Actually, we want to test R in a position we haven\'t tried? Currently we tried R in position 1 (which was wrong). Trying R in position 2 might be useful? Because if it\'s correct, we get a check? But if it\'s still present but elsewhere (e.g., positions 3,4,5) we get ""-"".\n\n   Similarly, for A, we tried position 2 and it was wrong. Now we can try position 3? Or 1?\n\n   So ""TRACK"" might be a good option? But it includes K? Not the most common.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PARTH"" might not be common? \n\n   Let me consider the Wordle dictionary? We need a valid English word.\n\n   Another common word: ""CRANE"" was already used? And we know E is out? So no.\n\n   ""SLATE"" has S and E? Both eliminated? No.\n\n   ""TABLE""? Has E? Eliminated? Table has E? T-A-B-L-E? Yes, E. And S? No, but E is bad.\n\n   Without E: ""ROAST"" has S? Eliminated? S is not allowed.\n\n   So words without E,I,S: \n\n   A common word: ""TAROT"" is in the dictionary? But not in Wordle\'s list? I\'m not sure.\n\n   Another: ""ABOUT"" - does not include R? No.\n\n   ""ALOFT"" - no R.\n\n   ""CAROB""? Has C, A, R, O, B -> but A is in position 2? We want to avoid A in 2? Actually, let me look:\n\n   Words that have R and A, without I,S,E: \n      TORCH? Not C,H? But TORCH: T,O,R,C,H -> no A.\n\n   ""BRAND"" -> B,R,A,N,D. Positions: B first? A in third? So:\n        Positions: B (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), D (5)\n\n   This: \n        Places R in position 2? So if secret has R in position 2, it will be correct. If not, we get ""-"". \n        Places A in position 3? Which hasn\'t been tested? So we can see if A is in position 3?\n\n   Also tests B, N, D.\n\n   ""BRAND"" seems reasonable? But note that feedback about R: if the secret word has R in position 2, we get R(?) as check? Otherwise, if R is elsewhere, we get ""-"".\n\n   Also, B is tested? We don\'t know.\n\n   Similarly, ""CRAMP"" - C,R,A,M,P -> positions: C1,R2,A3,M4,P5 -> again R in 2 and A in 3? But C is used? Also has M and P? Both new.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PARTY"" - P,A,R,T,Y -> A in 2? But we know A is not at 2? So A will be ""-"" again? And R in 3? Then A in 2 is bad? So if we use ""PARTY"", we have A in 2? Which we already know is wrong? So it doesn\'t test a new position for A? That\'s inefficient.\n\n   Therefore, we want a word with A and R in positions that aren\'t eliminated? So avoid A in 2? And avoid R in 1?\n\n   So positions for next guess: \n     Position 1: should not be R? Since we know R isn\'t there? Actually, we might test other letters? Position 1 we haven\'t tested? So we can put a new letter in 1? And put A and R in positions 3,4, or 5? Avoiding 2 for A and 1 for R.\n\n   Let me try to build: \n        Letter1: new letter? Not E,I,S,R? \n        Letter2: cannot be A? So new letter? And not E,I,S? \n        Letter3: could be A? or R?\n        Letter4: could be A? or R? \n        Letter5: could be a new letter?\n\n   Example: \n        ""TOUR"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n        ""HORNY"" -> no A.\n\n        ""PLAIN"" -> has I? And we know I is out.\n\n        ""LAYUP"" -> not in dictionary? \n\n        ""CARTY""? Not a word.\n\n   How about ""PARTY"" but move the positions?

We have two sets of feedback:

From Guess 1 (RAISE):
- R: present but not in position 1 (so in 2,3,4, or 5)
- A: present but not in position 2 (so in 1,3,4, or 5)
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: absent

From Guess 2 (ACORN):
- A: present but not in position 1 (so in 3,4, or 5) — note: we already knew A is not in 2, and now we know it's also not in 1? So A must be in 3,4, or 5? But wait, the feedback says A(-) meaning present but not in position 1? So we can update: A is in the word but not in position 1 or 2? So positions 3,4,5 are possible for A.
- C: absent (so C is not in the word)
- O: present but not in position 3 (so in 1,2,4, or 5? But we have constraints from the word? We know the word has 5 letters, and O is present but not in position 3? So O could be in 1,2,4,5? But we also have other constraints? For example, we know that position 1 cannot be R? But O could be in position 1? Or 2? Or 4? Or 5? 
- R: present but not in position 4 (so in 1,2,3, or 5? But we know R cannot be in position 1? So R must be in 2,3, or 5? And now we also know it's not in 4? So R must be in 2,3, or 5? 
- N: absent (so N is not in the word)

So now we know:
- Present letters: A, R, O (and we already knew A and R from before, and now O is new)
- Absent letters: I, S, E, C, N (so we must avoid these)
- A must be in positions 3,4,5? (since not in 1 or 2)
- R must be in positions 2,3,5? (since not in 1 or 4? And we know from guess1: not in 1, and from guess2: not in 4? So 2,3,5? But note: in guess2, R was in position 4? And we got ""-"", so not in 4? And from guess1, R was in 1 and got ""-"", so not in 1? So R must be in 2,3, or 5? 
- O must be in positions 1,2,4,5? (since not in 3? And we don't have other constraints? But we know the word has 5 letters? And we have to place A, R, and O? And two more letters? 

Also, we have two more positions? The word has 5 letters? We have three confirmed letters: A, R, O? But we don't know their positions? And we have two more letters to discover? 

But note: the secret word must have exactly these three? Or could there be duplicates? We don't know? But so far, no duplicates? 

We also know that the word does not contain: I,S,E,C,N.

So available letters: we have A, R, O, and two more? The two more must be from the remaining alphabet? Excluding I,S,E,C,N? And also excluding the ones we know? But we don't know the other two? 

We need to think of words that:
- Have A, R, O? (all three must be present? Because they are confirmed? But note: in the feedback, we have A(-), O(-), R(-) in guess2? So they are present? So the word must contain A, R, O? 
- Avoid I,S,E,C,N? 
- And satisfy the position constraints: 
    A: in 3,4,5? 
    R: in 2,3,5? 
    O: in 1,2,4,5? 

But note: the positions must be distinct? Because we don't have duplicates? Or could there be? We don't know? But let's assume no duplicates for now? 

So we have to assign A, R, O to three distinct positions? 

Possible positions for A: 3,4,5
Possible positions for R: 2,3,5
Possible positions for O: 1,2,4,5

But we have to assign without conflict? 

Also, the word has two more letters? So we need to choose two more letters? 

Let me list possible words? 

We can try to form words with A, R, O and two other letters? 

Common letters left: T, L, D, U, M, P, etc. 

But we need to form a valid English word? 

Also, we can use the position constraints? 

Let me consider the positions:

Case 1: A in position 3? 
    Then R can be in 2 or 5? (since 3 is taken by A? So R cannot be in 3? So R in 2 or 5? 
    Then O can be in 1,2,4,5? But if R is in 2, then O cannot be in 2? So O in 1,4,5? 
    Similarly, if R is in 5, then O can be in 1,2,4? 

Case 2: A in position 4? 
    Then R can be in 2,3,5? 
    O can be in 1,2,5? (since 4 is taken? So O cannot be in 4? 

Case 3: A in position 5? 
    Then R can be in 2,3? (since 5 is taken? So R in 2 or 3? 
    O can be in 1,2,4? (since 5 is taken? 

We need to choose a word that fits? 

Also, we have to pick two more letters? 

Let me think of words that have A, R, O? 

Examples: 
- ROAD? But 4 letters? 
- BROAD? B,R,O,A,D -> positions: B1, R2, O3, A4, D5? 
  Check constraints: 
      A is in 4? -> valid (A can be in 4? 
      R is in 2? -> valid (R can be in 2? 
      O is in 3? -> but in guess2, O was in position 3? And we got O(-) meaning O is not in position 3? So BROAD has O in 3? Which is invalid? Because we know O is not in position 3? 

  So BROAD is invalid? 

- ROAST? But has S? Eliminated? 

- ROAR? Not 5 letters? 

- ROOMY? Has O twice? And no A? 

- AROMA: A,R,O,M,A? But has two A's? And positions: 
        A1, R2, O3, M4, A5? 
  Check constraints: 
        A: in position 1? But from guess2, we know A is not in position 1? Because we got A(-) for position 1? So A cannot be in 1? 
        Also, in AROMA, A is in 1? Which is invalid? 

- FROST? Has S? Eliminated? 

- CROWD? Has C? Eliminated? 

- PROUD? P,R,O,U,D -> positions: P1, R2, O3, U4, D5? 
        O is in position 3? But we know O is not in position 3? So invalid? 

- GROUP? G,R,O,U,P -> O in 3? Again invalid? 

- GROAN? Has N? Eliminated? 

- ROLL? Not 5? 

- ROLE? Has E? Eliminated? 

- ROAD? Too short? 

- BOARD? B,O,A,R,D -> positions: B1, O2, A3, R4, D5? 
        Check: 
            A in 3? -> valid? 
            R in 4? -> but in guess2, we had R in position 4? And we got R(-) meaning R is not in 4? So BOARD has R in 4? Which is invalid? 

- BROAD? We already considered? O in 3? Invalid? 

- ROACH? Has C? Eliminated? 

- ROAST? Has S? 

- ROARS? Has S? 

- PAROL? P,A,R,O,L -> positions: P1, A2, R3, O4, L5? 
        But A in position 2? We know A is not in position 2? From guess1? So invalid? 

- MORAL? M,O,R,A,L -> positions: M1, O2, R3, A4, L5? 
        Check: 
            A in 4? -> valid? 
            R in 3? -> valid? (R can be in 3? 
            O in 2? -> valid? (O can be in 2? 
        Also, avoids I,S,E,C,N? 
        So ""MORAL"" is a candidate? 

But we have to check the feedback? 

In MORAL: 
    M: new? 
    O: in position 2? 
    R: in position 3? 
    A: in position 4? 
    L: new? 

We don't know about M and L? 

But we have to see if it fits? 

Another candidate: 
    ""ROYAL""? R,O,Y,A,L -> positions: R1, O2, Y3, A4, L5? 
        But R in position 1? We know R cannot be in position 1? From guess1? So invalid? 

    ""VOTAR""? Not common? 

    ""DOZAR""? Not common? 

    ""FLOAT""? F,L,O,A,T -> positions: F1, L2, O3, A4, T5? 
        But O in position 3? We know O is not in position 3? So invalid? 

    ""GLOAT""? Same? O in 3? 

    ""BLOAT""? Same? 

    ""COAST""? Has C and S? 

    ""TOPAZ""? T,O,P,A,Z -> positions: T1, O2, P3, A4, Z5? 
        O in 2? -> valid? 
        A in 4? -> valid? 
        But R? We must have R? But TOPAZ has no R? So invalid? 

    ""RADAR""? Has R and A? But no O? We must have O? 

    ""ORGAN""? Has N? Eliminated? 

    ""ARGON""? Has N? 

    ""BARON""? B,A,R,O,N -> has N? Eliminated? 

    ""CAROL""? Has C? 

    ""DROLL""? D,R,O,L,L -> duplicate L? And O in 3? 

    ""DROOP""? O in 3? 

    ""TROLL""? O in 3? 

    ""PROWL""? P,R,O,W,L -> O in 3? 

    ""CROWN""? Has C and N? 

    ""CROAK""? Has C? 

    ""TROOP""? O in 3? 

    ""TROUT""? T,R,O,U,T -> O in 3? 

    ""TROMP""? O in 3? 

    ""TROAD""? Not common? 

    ""TRAWL""? T,R,A,W,L -> positions: T1, R2, A3, W4, L5? 
        Check: 
            A in 3? -> valid? 
            R in 2? -> valid? 
            But O? We must have O? But TRAWL has no O? So invalid? 

    ""CRAWL""? Has C? 

    ""DRAWL""? D,R,A,W,L -> no O? 

    ""GRAIL""? Has I? 

    ""GRAIN""? Has I and N? 

    ""GRAND""? Has N? 

    ""BRAND""? Has N? 

    ""ORATE""? Has E? 

    ""OVARY""? O,V,A,R,Y -> positions: O1, V2, A3, R4, Y5? 
        Check: 
            O in 1? -> valid? (O can be in 1? 
            A in 3? -> valid? 
            R in 4? -> but we know R is not in 4? From guess2? So invalid? 

    ""OVARY"" has R in 4? Which is not allowed? 

    ""OAKUM""? O,A,K,U,M -> no R? 

    ""OARED""? Has E? 

    ""OATER""? O,A,T,E,R -> has E? 

    ""MORAL"" seems to be a good candidate? 

But let me check: 
    M O R A L
    Positions: 
        M:1, O:2, R:3, A:4, L:5

    Constraints:
        A: in 4? -> valid (A can be in 4? 
        R: in 3? -> valid (R can be in 3? 
        O: in 2? -> valid (O can be in 2? 

    And we avoid I,S,E,C,N? 

    So ""MORAL"" is a candidate? 

But we have to see if there are others? 

Another candidate: 
    ""FOLAR""? Not common? 

    ""SOLAR""? Has S? 

    ""POLAR""? P,O,L,A,R -> positions: P1, O2, L3, A4, R5? 
        Check: 
            A in 4? -> valid? 
            R in 5? -> valid? (R can be in 5? 
            O in 2? -> valid? 
        Avoids I,S,E,C,N? 
        So ""POLAR"" is also a candidate? 

    But note: in ""POLAR"", R is in position 5? Which is allowed? 

    Also, ""MORAL"" and ""POLAR"" are both candidates? 

    Another: ""ROTAL""? Not common? 

    ""VOCAL""? Has C? 

    ""LOCAL""? Has C? 

    ""FOCAL""? Has C? 

    ""DOTAL""? D,O,T,A,L -> no R? 

    ""TOTAL""? No R? 

    ""MORAL"" and ""POLAR"" are the two? 

    But we have to choose one? 

    Also, we can consider ""ROBOT""? But O in 3? And has O twice? 

    ""MORAL"" uses M and L? 
    ""POLAR"" uses P and L? 

    We haven't tried M or P? 

    We might want to test more common letters? 

    But we have limited guesses? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more new letters? 

    But we have to include A, R, O? 

    Another candidate: ""ROWDY""? R,O,W,D,Y -> positions: R1, O2, W3, D4, Y5? 
        But R in 1? Invalid? 

    ""DOWRY""? D,O,W,R,Y -> positions: D1, O2, W3, R4, Y5? 
        R in 4? But we know R is not in 4? From guess2? So invalid? 

    ""HOWARD""? Not 5? 

    ""GATOR""? G,A,T,O,R -> positions: G1, A2, T3, O4, R5? 
        But A in 2? We know A is not in 2? So invalid? 

    ""RATIO""? Has I? 

    ""RADIO""? Has I? 

    ""AUDIO""? Has I? 

    ""PATIO""? Has I? 

    ""ORBIT""? Has I? 

    ""FORUM""? F,O,R,U,M -> positions: F1, O2, R3, U4, M5? 
        Check: 
            O in 2? -> valid? 
            R in 3? -> valid? 
            But A? We must have A? But FORUM has no A? So invalid? 

    ""FORM""? Not 5? 

    ""FJORD""? F,J,O,R,D -> no A? 

    ""ABHOR""? We tried? But in guess2 we used ACORN? 

    ""ABHOR"" has A in 1? But we know A is not in 1? 

    So back to ""MORAL"" and ""POLAR""? 

    Let me see which one is more common? 

    We can also consider ""ROTAL""? Not common? 

    ""LORAL""? Not common? 

    ""CORAL""? Has C? 

    ""SORAL""? Has S? 

    ""TORAH""? T,O,R,A,H -> positions: T1, O2, R3, A4, H5? 
        This: 
            O in 2? -> valid? 
            R in 3? -> valid? 
            A in 4? -> valid? 
        Avoids I,S,E,C,N? 
        So ""TORAH"" is a candidate? 

    But is ""TORAH"" a word? It is? 

    So now we have three candidates: 
        MORAL: M1, O2, R3, A4, L5
        POLAR: P1, O2, L3, A4, R5
        TORAH: T1, O2, R3, A4, H5

    We need to choose one? 

    We can choose any? But we want to maximize information? 

    We have to test two new letters? 

    In MORAL: tests M and L? 
    In POLAR: tests P and L? 
    In TORAH: tests T and H? 

    T is a very common letter? So TORAH might be better? 

    Also, H is common? 

    But we have to see? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put O in 2? Because we haven't tested O in other positions? 

    But in TORAH, O is in 2? Which we are testing? 

    We know O is not in 3? But we don't know about 1,2,4,5? 

    In TORAH, we test O in 2? 

    Similarly, in MORAL and POLAR, O is in 2? 

    But we can also test O in other positions? 

    For example, if we put O in position 1? 

    Candidate: ""OCTAN""? Has C and N? 

    ""OPERA""? Has E? 

    ""ORBIT""? Has I? 

    ""OUTDO""? O,U,T,D,O -> duplicate O? And no R? 

    ""OUDRE""? Not common? 

    ""OULONG""? Not 5? 

    ""OUNCE""? Has C and E? 

    ""OLEUM""? Has E? 

    ""OLPAE""? Not common? 

    ""OMBRE""? Has E? 

    ""ONCET""? Has C and E? 

    ""OORAL""? Not common? 

    ""OPAHS""? Has S? 

    ""ORACH""? O,R,A,C,H -> has C? 

    ""ORANG""? Has N? 

    ""ORANT""? Has N? 

    ""ORATE""? Has E? 

    ""ORFES""? Has S? 

    ""ORLOP""? O,R,L,O,P -> duplicate O? 

    ""ORMER""? Has E? 

    ""ORNIS""? Has S? 

    ""ORPIN""? Has N? 

    ""ORRIS""? Has S? 

    ""OSMIC""? Has C? 

    ""OTARY""? O,T,A,R,Y -> positions: O1, T2, A3, R4, Y5? 
        Check: 
            O in 1? -> valid? 
            A in 3? -> valid? 
            R in 4? -> but we know R is not in 4? So invalid? 

    ""OUPHE""? Has E? 

    ""OUTRE""? Has E? 

    ""OVERT""? Has E? 

    ""OWLET""? Has E? 

    ""OXBOW""? No A? 

    So it's hard to find a word with O in 1? 

    Similarly, O in 4? 

    Candidate: ""FOCUS""? Has C? 

    ""LOCUS""? Has C? 

    ""FOLIA""? Has I? 

    ""DOLIA""? Has I? 

    ""COMET""? Has C and E? 

    ""BONUS""? Has N and S? 

    ""TONUS""? Has S? 

    ""LOTUS""? L,O,T,U,S -> has S? 

    ""MOTOR""? M,O,T,O,R -> duplicate O? And no A? 

    ""ROTOR""? No A? 

    ""DONOR""? Has N? 

    ""HONOR""? Has N? 

    ""VOTER""? Has E? 

    ""NOTER""? Has E? 

    ""COVER""? Has C and E? 

    ""MOVER""? Has E? 

    ""ROVER""? Has E? 

    ""DOVER""? Has E? 

    ""HOVER""? Has E? 

    ""LOVER""? Has E? 

    ""POKER""? Has E? 

    ""JOKER""? Has E? 

    ""TOWER""? Has E? 

    ""POWER""? Has E? 

    ""BOXER""? Has E? 

    ""FOYER""? Has E? 

    ""GOYER""? Not common? 

    ""HOYER""? Not common? 

    ""LOYER""? Not common? 

    ""VOYER""? Not common? 

    ""DOYEN""? Has N? 

    ""TOYON""? Has N? 

    ""GAYAL""? No O? 

    So it seems difficult? 

    Therefore, we might stick with the candidates we have: MORAL, POLAR, TORAH? 

    Among these, TORAH has T and H? Which are common? 

    But we have to see? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests a position we haven't tested? 

    For example, we haven't tested position 5 for A? Or position 5 for R? 

    In TORAH: 
        A is in 4? 
        R is in 3? 
        O in 2? 

    In POLAR: 
        A in 4? 
        R in 5? 
        O in 2? 

    In MORAL: 
        A in 4? 
        R in 3? 
        O in 2? 

    So POLAR tests R in 5? Which is a new position? 

    Also, we haven't tested position 5 for R? 

    So POLAR might be better? Because it tests R in 5? 

    Similarly, we haven't tested position 5 for A? But in POLAR, A is in 4? 

    But we can test A in 5? 

    Candidate: ""LARGO""? L,A,R,G,O -> positions: L1, A2, R3, G4, O5? 
        But A in 2? Invalid? 

    ""ARGOT""? A,R,G,O,T -> positions: A1, R2, G3, O4, T5? 
        But A in 1? We know A is not in 1? 

    ""ARGON""? Has N? 

    ""BARGO""? Not common? 

    ""CARGO""? Has C? 

    ""FARGO""? F,A,R,G,O -> positions: F1, A2, R3, G4, O5? 
        A in 2? Invalid? 

    ""MANGY""? Has N? 

    ""PARKA""? P,A,R,K,A -> duplicate A? And A in 2? 

    ""PARGO""? P,A,R,G,O -> A in 2? 

    ""TARGO""? Not common? 

    ""VIRGA""? Has I? 

    ""SORGO""? Has S? 

    ""ORGAN""? Has N? 

    ""ORGAN""? 

    ""ORGIA""? Has I? 

    ""ORGIC""? Has C? 

    ""ORIBI""? Has I? 

    ""ORIEL""? Has E? 

    ""ORLON""? Has N? 

    ""ORLOP""? O,R,L,O,P -> duplicate O? 

    ""ORMOLU""? Not 5? 

    ""ORNERY""? Not 5? 

    ""ORPHAN""? Not 5? 

    ""ORZO""? Not 5? 

    So it's hard to find a word with A in 5? 

    Similarly, R in 5? 

    We have POLAR: R in 5? 

    And we have not tested R in 5? 

    So let's choose POLAR? 

    But note: in POLAR, we have O in 2? Which we are testing? And we have L in 3? And P in 1? 

    We can also consider ""ROTAL""? Not common? 

    I think POLAR is a valid choice? 

    But let me check: 
        P O L A R
        Positions: P1, O2, L3, A4, R5

        Constraints:
            A: in 4? -> valid? 
            R: in 5? -> valid? (we haven't tested position 5 for R? And it's allowed? 
            O: in 2? -> valid? 

        And we avoid I,S,E,C,N? 

        So ""POLAR"" is a good guess? 

    Alternatively, we can choose ""MORAL"" to test M and L? 

    But I think testing R in 5 is valuable? 

    So I'll go with ""POLAR"". 

    But wait, we have to make sure that we are not missing? 

    Another candidate: ""DOULA""? D,O,U,L,A -> no R? 

    ""KOALA""? No R? 

    ""SOLAR""? Has S? 

    ""VOLAR""? V,O,L,A,R -> positions: V1, O2, L3, A4, R5? 
        This is similar to POLAR? But with V? 
        Avoids I,S,E,C,N? 
        So ""VOLAR"" is also a candidate? 

    But ""VOLAR"" is less common? 

    I think ""POLAR"" is better? 

    So let's guess ""POLAR"". 

    But note: we have to consider that we have only 6 guesses? 

    We are on guess 3? 

    So <guess>POLAR</guess> 

    But let me double-check the feedback we have? 

    We know: 
        A is not in 1 or 2? So in 3,4,5? 
        R is not in 1 or 4? So in 2,3,5? 
        O is not in 3? So in 1,2,4,5? 

    In POLAR: 
        A is in 4? -> if it's correct, then we get ✓ for A? 
        R is in 5? -> if it's correct, then ✓? 
        O is in 2? -> if it's correct, then ✓? 

    But if not, we get feedback? 

    We also test P and L? 

    So it's good? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more common letters? Like T? 

    But in TORAH, we have T and H? 

    But TORAH has R in 3? Which we have tested? In guess2, we had R in 4? But not in 3? 

    In guess1, R was in 1? 

    So position 3 for R is untested? 

    Similarly, in TORAH, we test R in 3? 

    And T in 1? 

    And H in 5? 

    And O in 2? 

    And A in 4? 

    So TORAH tests T and H? Which are common? 

    And we test R in 3? 

    But we also test O in 2? 

    And A in 4? 

    So both are good? 

    I think I'll go with TORAH because T is very common? 

    But we have to avoid C,N? 

    TORAH: T,O,R,A,H -> no C,N? 

    So it's valid? 

    And it's a word? 

    Yes, TORAH is a word? 

    So I'll choose TORAH? 

    But let me see the position constraints: 
        T in 1? -> we haven't tested T? 
        O in 2? -> valid? 
        R in 3? -> valid? 
        A in 4? -> valid? 
        H in 5? -> new? 

    And we avoid I,S,E,C,N? 

    So <guess>TORAH</guess> 

    But I'm a bit torn? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't fix O in 2? But we have to include O? 

    I think TORAH is fine? 

    Let's go with TORAH. 

    But note: in guess2, we had O in position 3? And it was wrong? But in TORAH, O is in 2? Which is new? 

    So we are testing a new position? 

    Similarly, for R: in guess1, R was in 1? In guess2, R was in 4? Now in TORAH, R is in 3? New position? 

    So it's good? 

    So I'll go with TORAH.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R and A are present but misplaced (not in positions 1 or 2), while I, S, and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (ACORN)**: A is present but not in position 1, O is present but not in position 3, R is present but not in position 4, and C and N are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters**: A, R, and O are in the secret word.
- **Absent letters**: I, S, E, C, N (must avoid these).
- **Position constraints**:
  - A: Cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → must be in 3, 4, or 5.
  - R: Cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → must be in 2, 3, or 5.
  - O: Cannot be in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- The secret word has exactly 5 letters, with no duplicates assumed (based on feedback).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Choose a word that includes A, R, and O, avoids I/S/E/C/N, and tests new positions for these letters.
- Prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., T, L, H) to maximize information.
- **TORAH** fits well:
  - Positions: T (1), O (2), R (3), A (4), H (5).
  - Tests A in position 4 (valid per constraints).
  - Tests R in position 3 (valid per constraints).
  - Tests O in position 2 (valid per constraints).
  - Introduces new common letters T and H.
  - Avoids forbidden letters (I/S/E/C/N).

This guess will help narrow down positions for A, R, and O while checking T and H.

<guess>TORAH</guess>",POLAR,"We have two sets of feedback:

From Guess 1 (RAISE):
- R: present but not in position 1 (so in 2,3,4, or 5)
- A: present but not in position 2 (so in 1,3,4, or 5)
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: absent

From Guess 2 (ACORN):
- A: present but not in position 1 (so in 3,4, or 5) — note: we already knew A is not in 2, and now we know it's also not in 1? So A must be in 3,4, or 5? But wait, the feedback says A(-) meaning present but not in position 1? So we can update: A is in the word but not in position 1 or 2? So positions 3,4,5 are possible for A.
- C: absent (so C is not in the word)
- O: present but not in position 3 (so in 1,2,4, or 5? But we have constraints from the word? We know the word has 5 letters, and O is present but not in position 3? So O could be in 1,2,4,5? But we also have other constraints? For example, we know that position 1 cannot be R? But O could be in position 1? Or 2? Or 4? Or 5? 
- R: present but not in position 4 (so in 1,2,3, or 5? But we know R cannot be in position 1? So R must be in 2,3, or 5? And now we also know it's not in 4? So R must be in 2,3, or 5? 
- N: absent (so N is not in the word)

So now we know:
- Present letters: A, R, O (and we already knew A and R from before, and now O is new)
- Absent letters: I, S, E, C, N (so we must avoid these)
- A must be in positions 3,4,5? (since not in 1 or 2)
- R must be in positions 2,3,5? (since not in 1 or 4? And we know from guess1: not in 1, and from guess2: not in 4? So 2,3,5? But note: in guess2, R was in position 4? And we got ""-"", so not in 4? And from guess1, R was in 1 and got ""-"", so not in 1? So R must be in 2,3, or 5? 
- O must be in positions 1,2,4,5? (since not in 3? And we don't have other constraints? But we know the word has 5 letters? And we have to place A, R, and O? And two more letters? 

Also, we have two more positions? The word has 5 letters? We have three confirmed letters: A, R, O? But we don't know their positions? And we have two more letters to discover? 

But note: the secret word must have exactly these three? Or could there be duplicates? We don't know? But so far, no duplicates? 

We also know that the word does not contain: I,S,E,C,N.

So available letters: we have A, R, O, and two more? The two more must be from the remaining alphabet? Excluding I,S,E,C,N? And also excluding the ones we know? But we don't know the other two? 

We need to think of words that:
- Have A, R, O? (all three must be present? Because they are confirmed? But note: in the feedback, we have A(-), O(-), R(-) in guess2? So they are present? So the word must contain A, R, O? 
- Avoid I,S,E,C,N? 
- And satisfy the position constraints: 
    A: in 3,4,5? 
    R: in 2,3,5? 
    O: in 1,2,4,5? 

But note: the positions must be distinct? Because we don't have duplicates? Or could there be? We don't know? But let's assume no duplicates for now? 

So we have to assign A, R, O to three distinct positions? 

Possible positions for A: 3,4,5
Possible positions for R: 2,3,5
Possible positions for O: 1,2,4,5

But we have to assign without conflict? 

Also, the word has two more letters? So we need to choose two more letters? 

Let me list possible words? 

We can try to form words with A, R, O and two other letters? 

Common letters left: T, L, D, U, M, P, etc. 

But we need to form a valid English word? 

Also, we can use the position constraints? 

Let me consider the positions:

Case 1: A in position 3? 
    Then R can be in 2 or 5? (since 3 is taken by A? So R cannot be in 3? So R in 2 or 5? 
    Then O can be in 1,2,4,5? But if R is in 2, then O cannot be in 2? So O in 1,4,5? 
    Similarly, if R is in 5, then O can be in 1,2,4? 

Case 2: A in position 4? 
    Then R can be in 2,3,5? 
    O can be in 1,2,5? (since 4 is taken? So O cannot be in 4? 

Case 3: A in position 5? 
    Then R can be in 2,3? (since 5 is taken? So R in 2 or 3? 
    O can be in 1,2,4? (since 5 is taken? 

We need to choose a word that fits? 

Also, we have to pick two more letters? 

Let me think of words that have A, R, O? 

Examples: 
- ROAD? But 4 letters? 
- BROAD? B,R,O,A,D -> positions: B1, R2, O3, A4, D5? 
  Check constraints: 
      A is in 4? -> valid (A can be in 4? 
      R is in 2? -> valid (R can be in 2? 
      O is in 3? -> but in guess2, O was in position 3? And we got O(-) meaning O is not in position 3? So BROAD has O in 3? Which is invalid? Because we know O is not in position 3? 

  So BROAD is invalid? 

- ROAST? But has S? Eliminated? 

- ROAR? Not 5 letters? 

- ROOMY? Has O twice? And no A? 

- AROMA: A,R,O,M,A? But has two A's? And positions: 
        A1, R2, O3, M4, A5? 
  Check constraints: 
        A: in position 1? But from guess2, we know A is not in position 1? Because we got A(-) for position 1? So A cannot be in 1? 
        Also, in AROMA, A is in 1? Which is invalid? 

- FROST? Has S? Eliminated? 

- CROWD? Has C? Eliminated? 

- PROUD? P,R,O,U,D -> positions: P1, R2, O3, U4, D5? 
        O is in position 3? But we know O is not in position 3? So invalid? 

- GROUP? G,R,O,U,P -> O in 3? Again invalid? 

- GROAN? Has N? Eliminated? 

- ROLL? Not 5? 

- ROLE? Has E? Eliminated? 

- ROAD? Too short? 

- BOARD? B,O,A,R,D -> positions: B1, O2, A3, R4, D5? 
        Check: 
            A in 3? -> valid? 
            R in 4? -> but in guess2, we had R in position 4? And we got R(-) meaning R is not in 4? So BOARD has R in 4? Which is invalid? 

- BROAD? We already considered? O in 3? Invalid? 

- ROACH? Has C? Eliminated? 

- ROAST? Has S? 

- ROARS? Has S? 

- PAROL? P,A,R,O,L -> positions: P1, A2, R3, O4, L5? 
        But A in position 2? We know A is not in position 2? From guess1? So invalid? 

- MORAL? M,O,R,A,L -> positions: M1, O2, R3, A4, L5? 
        Check: 
            A in 4? -> valid? 
            R in 3? -> valid? (R can be in 3? 
            O in 2? -> valid? (O can be in 2? 
        Also, avoids I,S,E,C,N? 
        So ""MORAL"" is a candidate? 

But we have to check the feedback? 

In MORAL: 
    M: new? 
    O: in position 2? 
    R: in position 3? 
    A: in position 4? 
    L: new? 

We don't know about M and L? 

But we have to see if it fits? 

Another candidate: 
    ""ROYAL""? R,O,Y,A,L -> positions: R1, O2, Y3, A4, L5? 
        But R in position 1? We know R cannot be in position 1? From guess1? So invalid? 

    ""VOTAR""? Not common? 

    ""DOZAR""? Not common? 

    ""FLOAT""? F,L,O,A,T -> positions: F1, L2, O3, A4, T5? 
        But O in position 3? We know O is not in position 3? So invalid? 

    ""GLOAT""? Same? O in 3? 

    ""BLOAT""? Same? 

    ""COAST""? Has C and S? 

    ""TOPAZ""? T,O,P,A,Z -> positions: T1, O2, P3, A4, Z5? 
        O in 2? -> valid? 
        A in 4? -> valid? 
        But R? We must have R? But TOPAZ has no R? So invalid? 

    ""RADAR""? Has R and A? But no O? We must have O? 

    ""ORGAN""? Has N? Eliminated? 

    ""ARGON""? Has N? 

    ""BARON""? B,A,R,O,N -> has N? Eliminated? 

    ""CAROL""? Has C? 

    ""DROLL""? D,R,O,L,L -> duplicate L? And O in 3? 

    ""DROOP""? O in 3? 

    ""TROLL""? O in 3? 

    ""PROWL""? P,R,O,W,L -> O in 3? 

    ""CROWN""? Has C and N? 

    ""CROAK""? Has C? 

    ""TROOP""? O in 3? 

    ""TROUT""? T,R,O,U,T -> O in 3? 

    ""TROMP""? O in 3? 

    ""TROAD""? Not common? 

    ""TRAWL""? T,R,A,W,L -> positions: T1, R2, A3, W4, L5? 
        Check: 
            A in 3? -> valid? 
            R in 2? -> valid? 
            But O? We must have O? But TRAWL has no O? So invalid? 

    ""CRAWL""? Has C? 

    ""DRAWL""? D,R,A,W,L -> no O? 

    ""GRAIL""? Has I? 

    ""GRAIN""? Has I and N? 

    ""GRAND""? Has N? 

    ""BRAND""? Has N? 

    ""ORATE""? Has E? 

    ""OVARY""? O,V,A,R,Y -> positions: O1, V2, A3, R4, Y5? 
        Check: 
            O in 1? -> valid? (O can be in 1? 
            A in 3? -> valid? 
            R in 4? -> but we know R is not in 4? From guess2? So invalid? 

    ""OVARY"" has R in 4? Which is not allowed? 

    ""OAKUM""? O,A,K,U,M -> no R? 

    ""OARED""? Has E? 

    ""OATER""? O,A,T,E,R -> has E? 

    ""MORAL"" seems to be a good candidate? 

But let me check: 
    M O R A L
    Positions: 
        M:1, O:2, R:3, A:4, L:5

    Constraints:
        A: in 4? -> valid (A can be in 4? 
        R: in 3? -> valid (R can be in 3? 
        O: in 2? -> valid (O can be in 2? 

    And we avoid I,S,E,C,N? 

    So ""MORAL"" is a candidate? 

But we have to see if there are others? 

Another candidate: 
    ""FOLAR""? Not common? 

    ""SOLAR""? Has S? 

    ""POLAR""? P,O,L,A,R -> positions: P1, O2, L3, A4, R5? 
        Check: 
            A in 4? -> valid? 
            R in 5? -> valid? (R can be in 5? 
            O in 2? -> valid? 
        Avoids I,S,E,C,N? 
        So ""POLAR"" is also a candidate? 

    But note: in ""POLAR"", R is in position 5? Which is allowed? 

    Also, ""MORAL"" and ""POLAR"" are both candidates? 

    Another: ""ROTAL""? Not common? 

    ""VOCAL""? Has C? 

    ""LOCAL""? Has C? 

    ""FOCAL""? Has C? 

    ""DOTAL""? D,O,T,A,L -> no R? 

    ""TOTAL""? No R? 

    ""MORAL"" and ""POLAR"" are the two? 

    But we have to choose one? 

    Also, we can consider ""ROBOT""? But O in 3? And has O twice? 

    ""MORAL"" uses M and L? 
    ""POLAR"" uses P and L? 

    We haven't tried M or P? 

    We might want to test more common letters? 

    But we have limited guesses? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more new letters? 

    But we have to include A, R, O? 

    Another candidate: ""ROWDY""? R,O,W,D,Y -> positions: R1, O2, W3, D4, Y5? 
        But R in 1? Invalid? 

    ""DOWRY""? D,O,W,R,Y -> positions: D1, O2, W3, R4, Y5? 
        R in 4? But we know R is not in 4? From guess2? So invalid? 

    ""HOWARD""? Not 5? 

    ""GATOR""? G,A,T,O,R -> positions: G1, A2, T3, O4, R5? 
        But A in 2? We know A is not in 2? So invalid? 

    ""RATIO""? Has I? 

    ""RADIO""? Has I? 

    ""AUDIO""? Has I? 

    ""PATIO""? Has I? 

    ""ORBIT""? Has I? 

    ""FORUM""? F,O,R,U,M -> positions: F1, O2, R3, U4, M5? 
        Check: 
            O in 2? -> valid? 
            R in 3? -> valid? 
            But A? We must have A? But FORUM has no A? So invalid? 

    ""FORM""? Not 5? 

    ""FJORD""? F,J,O,R,D -> no A? 

    ""ABHOR""? We tried? But in guess2 we used ACORN? 

    ""ABHOR"" has A in 1? But we know A is not in 1? 

    So back to ""MORAL"" and ""POLAR""? 

    Let me see which one is more common? 

    We can also consider ""ROTAL""? Not common? 

    ""LORAL""? Not common? 

    ""CORAL""? Has C? 

    ""SORAL""? Has S? 

    ""TORAH""? T,O,R,A,H -> positions: T1, O2, R3, A4, H5? 
        This: 
            O in 2? -> valid? 
            R in 3? -> valid? 
            A in 4? -> valid? 
        Avoids I,S,E,C,N? 
        So ""TORAH"" is a candidate? 

    But is ""TORAH"" a word? It is? 

    So now we have three candidates: 
        MORAL: M1, O2, R3, A4, L5
        POLAR: P1, O2, L3, A4, R5
        TORAH: T1, O2, R3, A4, H5

    We need to choose one? 

    We can choose any? But we want to maximize information? 

    We have to test two new letters? 

    In MORAL: tests M and L? 
    In POLAR: tests P and L? 
    In TORAH: tests T and H? 

    T is a very common letter? So TORAH might be better? 

    Also, H is common? 

    But we have to see? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put O in 2? Because we haven't tested O in other positions? 

    But in TORAH, O is in 2? Which we are testing? 

    We know O is not in 3? But we don't know about 1,2,4,5? 

    In TORAH, we test O in 2? 

    Similarly, in MORAL and POLAR, O is in 2? 

    But we can also test O in other positions? 

    For example, if we put O in position 1? 

    Candidate: ""OCTAN""? Has C and N? 

    ""OPERA""? Has E? 

    ""ORBIT""? Has I? 

    ""OUTDO""? O,U,T,D,O -> duplicate O? And no R? 

    ""OUDRE""? Not common? 

    ""OULONG""? Not 5? 

    ""OUNCE""? Has C and E? 

    ""OLEUM""? Has E? 

    ""OLPAE""? Not common? 

    ""OMBRE""? Has E? 

    ""ONCET""? Has C and E? 

    ""OORAL""? Not common? 

    ""OPAHS""? Has S? 

    ""ORACH""? O,R,A,C,H -> has C? 

    ""ORANG""? Has N? 

    ""ORANT""? Has N? 

    ""ORATE""? Has E? 

    ""ORFES""? Has S? 

    ""ORLOP""? O,R,L,O,P -> duplicate O? 

    ""ORMER""? Has E? 

    ""ORNIS""? Has S? 

    ""ORPIN""? Has N? 

    ""ORRIS""? Has S? 

    ""OSMIC""? Has C? 

    ""OTARY""? O,T,A,R,Y -> positions: O1, T2, A3, R4, Y5? 
        Check: 
            O in 1? -> valid? 
            A in 3? -> valid? 
            R in 4? -> but we know R is not in 4? So invalid? 

    ""OUPHE""? Has E? 

    ""OUTRE""? Has E? 

    ""OVERT""? Has E? 

    ""OWLET""? Has E? 

    ""OXBOW""? No A? 

    So it's hard to find a word with O in 1? 

    Similarly, O in 4? 

    Candidate: ""FOCUS""? Has C? 

    ""LOCUS""? Has C? 

    ""FOLIA""? Has I? 

    ""DOLIA""? Has I? 

    ""COMET""? Has C and E? 

    ""BONUS""? Has N and S? 

    ""TONUS""? Has S? 

    ""LOTUS""? L,O,T,U,S -> has S? 

    ""MOTOR""? M,O,T,O,R -> duplicate O? And no A? 

    ""ROTOR""? No A? 

    ""DONOR""? Has N? 

    ""HONOR""? Has N? 

    ""VOTER""? Has E? 

    ""NOTER""? Has E? 

    ""COVER""? Has C and E? 

    ""MOVER""? Has E? 

    ""ROVER""? Has E? 

    ""DOVER""? Has E? 

    ""HOVER""? Has E? 

    ""LOVER""? Has E? 

    ""POKER""? Has E? 

    ""JOKER""? Has E? 

    ""TOWER""? Has E? 

    ""POWER""? Has E? 

    ""BOXER""? Has E? 

    ""FOYER""? Has E? 

    ""GOYER""? Not common? 

    ""HOYER""? Not common? 

    ""LOYER""? Not common? 

    ""VOYER""? Not common? 

    ""DOYEN""? Has N? 

    ""TOYON""? Has N? 

    ""GAYAL""? No O? 

    So it seems difficult? 

    Therefore, we might stick with the candidates we have: MORAL, POLAR, TORAH? 

    Among these, TORAH has T and H? Which are common? 

    But we have to see? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests a position we haven't tested? 

    For example, we haven't tested position 5 for A? Or position 5 for R? 

    In TORAH: 
        A is in 4? 
        R is in 3? 
        O in 2? 

    In POLAR: 
        A in 4? 
        R in 5? 
        O in 2? 

    In MORAL: 
        A in 4? 
        R in 3? 
        O in 2? 

    So POLAR tests R in 5? Which is a new position? 

    Also, we haven't tested position 5 for R? 

    So POLAR might be better? Because it tests R in 5? 

    Similarly, we haven't tested position 5 for A? But in POLAR, A is in 4? 

    But we can test A in 5? 

    Candidate: ""LARGO""? L,A,R,G,O -> positions: L1, A2, R3, G4, O5? 
        But A in 2? Invalid? 

    ""ARGOT""? A,R,G,O,T -> positions: A1, R2, G3, O4, T5? 
        But A in 1? We know A is not in 1? 

    ""ARGON""? Has N? 

    ""BARGO""? Not common? 

    ""CARGO""? Has C? 

    ""FARGO""? F,A,R,G,O -> positions: F1, A2, R3, G4, O5? 
        A in 2? Invalid? 

    ""MANGY""? Has N? 

    ""PARKA""? P,A,R,K,A -> duplicate A? And A in 2? 

    ""PARGO""? P,A,R,G,O -> A in 2? 

    ""TARGO""? Not common? 

    ""VIRGA""? Has I? 

    ""SORGO""? Has S? 

    ""ORGAN""? Has N? 

    ""ORGAN""? 

    ""ORGIA""? Has I? 

    ""ORGIC""? Has C? 

    ""ORIBI""? Has I? 

    ""ORIEL""? Has E? 

    ""ORLON""? Has N? 

    ""ORLOP""? O,R,L,O,P -> duplicate O? 

    ""ORMOLU""? Not 5? 

    ""ORNERY""? Not 5? 

    ""ORPHAN""? Not 5? 

    ""ORZO""? Not 5? 

    So it's hard to find a word with A in 5? 

    Similarly, R in 5? 

    We have POLAR: R in 5? 

    And we have not tested R in 5? 

    So let's choose POLAR? 

    But note: in POLAR, we have O in 2? Which we are testing? And we have L in 3? And P in 1? 

    We can also consider ""ROTAL""? Not common? 

    I think POLAR is a valid choice? 

    But let me check: 
        P O L A R
        Positions: P1, O2, L3, A4, R5

        Constraints:
            A: in 4? -> valid? 
            R: in 5? -> valid? (we haven't tested position 5 for R? And it's allowed? 
            O: in 2? -> valid? 

        And we avoid I,S,E,C,N? 

        So ""POLAR"" is a good guess? 

    Alternatively, we can choose ""MORAL"" to test M and L? 

    But I think testing R in 5 is valuable? 

    So I'll go with ""POLAR"". 

    But wait, we have to make sure that we are not missing? 

    Another candidate: ""DOULA""? D,O,U,L,A -> no R? 

    ""KOALA""? No R? 

    ""SOLAR""? Has S? 

    ""VOLAR""? V,O,L,A,R -> positions: V1, O2, L3, A4, R5? 
        This is similar to POLAR? But with V? 
        Avoids I,S,E,C,N? 
        So ""VOLAR"" is also a candidate? 

    But ""VOLAR"" is less common? 

    I think ""POLAR"" is better? 

    So let's guess ""POLAR"". 

    But note: we have to consider that we have only 6 guesses? 

    We are on guess 3? 

    So <guess>POLAR</guess> 

    But let me double-check the feedback we have? 

    We know: 
        A is not in 1 or 2? So in 3,4,5? 
        R is not in 1 or 4? So in 2,3,5? 
        O is not in 3? So in 1,2,4,5? 

    In POLAR: 
        A is in 4? -> if it's correct, then we get ✓ for A? 
        R is in 5? -> if it's correct, then ✓? 
        O is in 2? -> if it's correct, then ✓? 

    But if not, we get feedback? 

    We also test P and L? 

    So it's good? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more common letters? Like T? 

    But in TORAH, we have T and H? 

    But TORAH has R in 3? Which we have tested? In guess2, we had R in 4? But not in 3? 

    In guess1, R was in 1? 

    So position 3 for R is untested? 

    Similarly, in TORAH, we test R in 3? 

    And T in 1? 

    And H in 5? 

    And O in 2? 

    And A in 4? 

    So TORAH tests T and H? Which are common? 

    And we test R in 3? 

    But we also test O in 2? 

    And A in 4? 

    So both are good? 

    I think I'll go with TORAH because T is very common? 

    But we have to avoid C,N? 

    TORAH: T,O,R,A,H -> no C,N? 

    So it's valid? 

    And it's a word? 

    Yes, TORAH is a word? 

    So I'll choose TORAH? 

    But let me see the position constraints: 
        T in 1? -> we haven't tested T? 
        O in 2? -> valid? 
        R in 3? -> valid? 
        A in 4? -> valid? 
        H in 5? -> new? 

    And we avoid I,S,E,C,N? 

    So <guess>TORAH</guess> 

    But I'm a bit torn? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't fix O in 2? But we have to include O? 

    I think TORAH is fine? 

    Let's go with TORAH. 

    But note: in guess2, we had O in position 3? And it was wrong? But in TORAH, O is in 2? Which is new? 

    So we are testing a new position? 

    Similarly, for R: in guess1, R was in 1? In guess2, R was in 4? Now in TORAH, R is in 3? New position? 

    So it's good? 

    So I'll go with TORAH.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R and A are present but misplaced (not in positions 1 or 2), while I, S, and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (ACORN)**: A is present but not in position 1, O is present but not in position 3, R is present but not in position 4, and C and N are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters**: A, R, and O are in the secret word.
- **Absent letters**: I, S, E, C, N (must avoid these).
- **Position constraints**:
  - A: Cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → must be in 3, 4, or 5.
  - R: Cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → must be in 2, 3, or 5.
  - O: Cannot be in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- The secret word has exactly 5 letters, with no duplicates assumed (based on feedback).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Choose a word that includes A, R, and O, avoids I/S/E/C/N, and tests new positions for these letters.
- Prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., T, L, H) to maximize information.
- **TORAH** fits well:
  - Positions: T (1), O (2), R (3), A (4), H (5).
  - Tests A in position 4 (valid per constraints).
  - Tests R in position 3 (valid per constraints).
  - Tests O in position 2 (valid per constraints).
  - Introduces new common letters T and H.
  - Avoids forbidden letters (I/S/E/C/N).

This guess will help narrow down positions for A, R, and O while checking T and H.",Guess 3: POLAR -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) L(x) A(-) R(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,bravo,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are at the very start of the game. We haven't received any feedback yet.
 Since there's no prior information, we want a word that gives us good coverage of common letters.
 This might help us get useful feedback about which letters are present and where they are.
 
 Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
 Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 Many players use words like ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"" as starting words because they have common letters.

 Let me pick one: ""RAISE"" - it has common vowels and consonants.

 Alternatively, another common starting word is ""SLATE"".

 I'll go with ""RAISE"" for now.<thinking>
We are starting the game, so there's no previous feedback. For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This typically means including common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.

Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N

A good starting word like ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" covers several of these. Let's go with ""RAISE"":

- R, A, I, S, E are all common letters.
- It includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- This should help us get feedback on multiple frequent letters.

Other strong starters (like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"") are also reasonable, but ""RAISE"" is a classic choice.
</thinking>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: RAISE → R(-), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
 Interpretation:
 - R and A are in the secret word but in the wrong position (so they must be present but not in position 1 or 2 respectively).
 - I, S, and E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains R and A.
 - The secret word does not contain I, S, or E.
 - Since R is not in position 1, and A is not in position 2, we must place them elsewhere.

 Also, because R and A are present but misplaced, we can infer:
 - R cannot be in the first position, so it must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, but since the word is 5 letters, positions 2 to 5.
 - Similarly, A cannot be in the second position, so it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, A is in the word but not in the second position. It could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, note that in the first guess, R was in position 1 and A in position 2, and both were marked as ""-"" meaning wrong position. So:
 - R is in the word but not in position 1.
 - A is in the word but not in position 2.

 So A could be in position 1? Let's check: if A were in position 1, then in the first guess A was in position 2, which is wrong. But position 1 is open? That's possible.

 But wait, we have a constraint: if A were in position 1, then in our guess RAISE, the first letter is R, which is wrong, and A would be in position 1 of the secret? Then for the second letter (A in guess), it would be compared to position 2 of secret. Since A is actually in position 1, then for position 2 of guess, it wouldn't be A, so the feedback for A would still be ""-"" meaning it's in the word but not position 2. That's consistent.

 So A could be in position 1? However, let's think about the R: if A were in position 1, then R couldn't be in position 1, so R must be elsewhere.

 But note: the secret word must have R and A, so we must choose a word that includes R and A, but not I, S, E.

 Also, we have eliminated letters: I, S, E are out.

 What about other letters? We haven't tried many yet.

 We should choose a word that has R and A, and avoids I, S, E.

 Possible positions for R: 2,3,4,5. Similarly for A: 1,3,4,5 (avoiding position 2).

 However, note that A cannot be in 2 and R cannot be in 1.

 We need to consider which letters to try next. We have 5 new positions to cover.

 Common consonants we haven't tried: T, N, L, etc.

 Given that we have R and A, we can try a word with T or another vowel? Vowels: we have A (and we know A is present) and we tried E and I, which are out. So remaining vowels: O, U, sometimes Y. But we should avoid using E and I again.

 Also, note that we have only 6 guesses.

 What words have R and A, but no I, S, E?

 Examples: TRACK, TRACT, PARTY, CARDS, but CARDS has S which is eliminated. So avoid S.

 Let me think: 
 - Words without I, S, E: 
   Must include R and A.

 Possible: 
 - BOARD? But has O, A, R, B, D. Also, A is in position 2? But we must avoid having A in position 2? No, A cannot be in position 2? Actually, from feedback: in the guess RAISE, the A was in position 2 and was wrong. But the secret word might have A in another position, including position 1? Or anywhere else.

 Actually, position 2 in the secret word could be anything as long as it's not A? Or if A is elsewhere, then position 2 could have another letter.

 But the feedback does not say that position 2 is occupied by some other letter that also prevented A from being there? It only says A is elsewhere.

 So for the next guess, we want to:
   - Include R and A (mandatory).
   - Exclude I, S, E (since they are not in the word).
   - Place R not at position 1 and A not at position 2? Actually, we can try to put R in a different position and A in a different position? Yes.

 However, we might place A in position 1? Because that's not ruled out.

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters? We haven't checked T, O, U, L, N, C, etc.

 Let me consider: a word starting with T? Or something.

 Ideal: choose a word that has T, O, N, etc. and includes R and A but placed differently.

 Example: 
   TAROT? But has T and O, two T's? But let's see: avoids I,S,E. Includes A and R. Also positions: 
      T in position 1, A in position 2? But wait, A cannot be in position 2? Actually, we must avoid putting A in position 2? Because in the secret word, A is not in position 2? Correct.

 But in our next guess, we can put A in position 2? It wouldn't be A in the secret's position 2, but we might get feedback that A is in the word but wrong position again? Or if by chance the secret has A in position 2? Then it would be correct? But the feedback said A was wrong position in the first guess, meaning in the secret word, A is not in position 2.

 Therefore, we must not put A in position 2 in our guess? Actually, we can put A anywhere we want in the guess to test positions. But if the secret word has A not in position 2, then putting A in position 2 in our guess will yield ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Or if we put A in position 1 and it's actually in position 1, we get a checkmark.

 Similarly for R: we must not put R in position 1? Because it's wrong? But we can put R elsewhere to see if it fits.

 Actually, we must test possible positions for R and A.

 Let me list possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5 (since 2 is bad)
 For R: 2,3,4,5 (since 1 is bad)

 We need to choose a word that satisfies:
   Positions: 
        A not in 2? Actually, our guess can have A in 2, but the secret doesn't, so it will be marked ""-"". Similarly R in 1 will be marked ""-"", but we know that already so it's wasteful to put R in 1? Better to avoid using R in 1 and A in 2? So we can put them in other positions.

 However, since we are limited in letters, we might try to maximize information by testing letters we haven't tried: T, O, N, L, etc.

 I propose a word like ""ROTAN"" but that might not be common. Let's think valid words.

 Common words: 
   ""PLANT"" - has P, L, A, N, T. But does it include R? No. So not.

   ""CHART"" - has C, H, A, R, T. Positions? 
        C in 1, H in 2, A in 3, R in 4, T in 5.
        This has A in position 3 and R in position 4? Both are possible? And we avoid I,S,E.

   But does it put A and R in positions we haven't tested? And also tests C, H, T.

   Alternatively, ""PARTY"" - has P, A, R, T, Y. But A is in position 2? We shouldn't put A in position 2 because we know the secret doesn't have A in 2? Actually, we can put A in position 2 to confirm? But it will be wrong. Or we might test it? However, if we put A in position 2, it will give ""-"" for A again? Which doesn't give new information? So better to try a new position.

   We want to test A in a different position? So let's put A in 3 or 4 or 1? Similarly for R.

   So ""CHART"": A in 3, R in 4? That tests A in position 3 and R in position 4.

   Or ""TRACK"": T in 1, R in 2? But R cannot be in position 1? Well, in this guess, R is in position 2? Which is possible? Secret could have R in position 2? And A in position 3? Then positions: 
        T (position1), R (position2), A (position3), C (position4), K (position5)

   But T, C, K are new letters.

   However, note that if secret has R in position 2, then in our guess we have R in position 2? That would be correct? But we don't know.

   Actually, we want to test R in a position we haven't tried? Currently we tried R in position 1 (which was wrong). Trying R in position 2 might be useful? Because if it's correct, we get a check? But if it's still present but elsewhere (e.g., positions 3,4,5) we get ""-"".

   Similarly, for A, we tried position 2 and it was wrong. Now we can try position 3? Or 1?

   So ""TRACK"" might be a good option? But it includes K? Not the most common.

   Alternatively, ""PARTH"" might not be common? 

   Let me consider the Wordle dictionary? We need a valid English word.

   Another common word: ""CRANE"" was already used? And we know E is out? So no.

   ""SLATE"" has S and E? Both eliminated? No.

   ""TABLE""? Has E? Eliminated? Table has E? T-A-B-L-E? Yes, E. And S? No, but E is bad.

   Without E: ""ROAST"" has S? Eliminated? S is not allowed.

   So words without E,I,S: 

   A common word: ""TAROT"" is in the dictionary? But not in Wordle's list? I'm not sure.

   Another: ""ABOUT"" - does not include R? No.

   ""ALOFT"" - no R.

   ""CAROB""? Has C, A, R, O, B -> but A is in position 2? We want to avoid A in 2? Actually, let me look:

   Words that have R and A, without I,S,E: 
      TORCH? Not C,H? But TORCH: T,O,R,C,H -> no A.

   ""BRAND"" -> B,R,A,N,D. Positions: B first? A in third? So:
        Positions: B (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), D (5)

   This: 
        Places R in position 2? So if secret has R in position 2, it will be correct. If not, we get ""-"". 
        Places A in position 3? Which hasn't been tested? So we can see if A is in position 3?

   Also tests B, N, D.

   ""BRAND"" seems reasonable? But note that feedback about R: if the secret word has R in position 2, we get R(?) as check? Otherwise, if R is elsewhere, we get ""-"".

   Also, B is tested? We don't know.

   Similarly, ""CRAMP"" - C,R,A,M,P -> positions: C1,R2,A3,M4,P5 -> again R in 2 and A in 3? But C is used? Also has M and P? Both new.

   Alternatively, ""PARTY"" - P,A,R,T,Y -> A in 2? But we know A is not at 2? So A will be ""-"" again? And R in 3? Then A in 2 is bad? So if we use ""PARTY"", we have A in 2? Which we already know is wrong? So it doesn't test a new position for A? That's inefficient.

   Therefore, we want a word with A and R in positions that aren't eliminated? So avoid A in 2? And avoid R in 1?

   So positions for next guess: 
     Position 1: should not be R? Since we know R isn't there? Actually, we might test other letters? Position 1 we haven't tested? So we can put a new letter in 1? And put A and R in positions 3,4, or 5? Avoiding 2 for A and 1 for R.

   Let me try to build: 
        Letter1: new letter? Not E,I,S,R? 
        Letter2: cannot be A? So new letter? And not E,I,S? 
        Letter3: could be A? or R?
        Letter4: could be A? or R? 
        Letter5: could be a new letter?

   Example: 
        ""TOUR"" -> not 5 letters.

        ""HORNY"" -> no A.

        ""PLAIN"" -> has I? And we know I is out.

        ""LAYUP"" -> not in dictionary? 

        ""CARTY""? Not a word.

   How about ""PARTY"" but move the positions? But that's rearranged to ""PRAT"" (not 5). 

   Another idea: ""CARVE"" -> has E? Eliminated? E is out.

   ""MANOR"" -> M,A,N,O,R: positions: M1, A2? But we avoid position 2 for A? So A is in 2? Which is bad? We put A in 2? That's okay? We'll get ""-"" for A? But we already know that? So putting A in 2 uses up a slot? We want to test new positions? 

   We have limited guesses? Try to test A in a new position? For instance, position 1?

   Word with A at position 1? 
        ""AUDIO"" -> eliminated letters? Has I? And we know I is out? Also not including R? 

        ""ALERT"" -> has E? Eliminated?

        ""ABHOR"" -> A,B,H,O,R -> positions: A(1), B(2), H(3), O(4), R(5)
     This: 
        Puts A in position 1? That's a new position? We never tested position 1 for A? 
        Puts R in position 5? Also new? We had R in 1? Now in 5? 
        Avoids I, S, E.

     Also tests letters: B, H, O.

     But is ""ABHOR"" a common word? It might be accepted? 

     Alternatively, ""ANVIL"" has I? And V? But I is bad.

     ""ADORE"" -> has E? Bad.

     Without E and I: ""ABOIL""? Contains I? 

     Another word: ""ACORN"" -> A,C,O,R,N -> positions: A(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)
        This has A in 1, R in 4? And tests C, O, N? 
        Avoids E,I,S.

        So ""ACORN"" might be a good choice.

     What about ""ALARM"" -> has A,L,A,R,M? But duplicate A? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But Wordle allows duplicates? Actually, Wordle words can have duplicates? But not often? We haven't ruled out duplicates? But no clues so far.

     Actually, the feedback for RAISE: we had R and A and no duplicates? So the secret might have duplicates? Not necessarily? But for information, we avoid duplicates? 

     ""ACORN"": A, C, O, R, N - all unique.

     Similarly, ""ABHOR"": A,B,H,O,R - unique.

     I think both are valid. I'll choose ""ACORN"".

   Why ""ACORN""?
        Tests A in position 1 (new, we haven't tried) -> if it's correct, then ✓, else if A is present but not 1, then ""-"". 
        Tests R in position 4? We haven't tried that? Previously R was in 1? Now in 4? 
        Tests C, O, N? All common letters.

   Also, note that we avoid E,I,S? Covered.

   So let's go with ""ACORN"".

   Alternative: ""AUDIO"" is bad? Has I? 

   So ""ACORN"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R and A are present in the secret word but misplaced (so R is not in position 1, and A is not in position 2).
- I, S, and E are absent from the secret word.

For the next guess, we need to:
1. Include both R and A, as they are confirmed to be in the word.
2. Avoid I, S, and E entirely.
3. Test new positions for R and A to gather more locational clues.
4. Introduce new common letters (like C, O, N) to maximize information.

The word ""ACORN"" fits perfectly:
- Places A in position 1 (never tested before) → could reveal if A belongs at the start or is misplaced.
- Places R in position 4 (unexplored position) → tests a new slot.
- Introduces C (position 2), O (position 3), and N (position 5) → valuable new letters.
- Excludes forbidden letters (I, S, E) and adheres to length.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)

<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

- A: present but not in position 2 (so in 1,3,4, or 5)
- I: absent
- S: absent

From Guess 2 (ACORN):
- A: present but not in position 1 (so in 3,4, or 5) — note: we already knew A is not in 2, and now we know it's also not in 1? So A must be in 3,4, or 5? But wait, the feedback says A(-) meaning present but not in position 1? So we can update: A is in the word but not in position 1 or 2? So positions 3,4,5 are possible for A.
- C: absent (so C is not in the word)
- O: present but not in position 3 (so in 1,2,4, or 5? But we have constraints from the word? We know the word has 5 letters, and O is present but not in position 3? So O could be in 1,2,4,5? But we also have other constraints? For example, we know that position 1 cannot be R? But O could be in position 1? Or 2? Or 4? Or 5? 
- R: present but not in position 4 (so in 1,2,3, or 5? But we know R cannot be in position 1? So R must be in 2,3, or 5? And now we also know it's not in 4? So R must be in 2,3, or 5? 
- N: absent (so N is not in the word)

So now we know:
- Present letters: A, R, O (and we already knew A and R from before, and now O is new)
- Absent letters: I, S, E, C, N (so we must avoid these)
- A must be in positions 3,4,5? (since not in 1 or 2)
- R must be in positions 2,3,5? (since not in 1 or 4? And we know from guess1: not in 1, and from guess2: not in 4? So 2,3,5? But note: in guess2, R was in position 4? And we got ""-"", so not in 4? And from guess1, R was in 1 and got ""-"", so not in 1? So R must be in 2,3, or 5? 
- O must be in positions 1,2,4,5? (since not in 3? And we don't have other constraints? But we know the word has 5 letters? And we have to place A, R, and O? And two more letters? 

Also, we have two more positions? The word has 5 letters? We have three confirmed letters: A, R, O? But we don't know their positions? And we have two more letters to discover? 

But note: the secret word must have exactly these three? Or could there be duplicates? We don't know? But so far, no duplicates? 

We also know that the word does not contain: I,S,E,C,N.

So available letters: we have A, R, O, and two more? The two more must be from the remaining alphabet? Excluding I,S,E,C,N? And also excluding the ones we know? But we don't know the other two? 

We need to think of words that:
- Have A, R, O? (all three must be present? Because they are confirmed? But note: in the feedback, we have A(-), O(-), R(-) in guess2? So they are present? So the word must contain A, R, O? 
- Avoid I,S,E,C,N? 
- And satisfy the position constraints: 
    A: in 3,4,5? 
    R: in 2,3,5? 
    O: in 1,2,4,5? 

But note: the positions must be distinct? Because we don't have duplicates? Or could there be? We don't know? But let's assume no duplicates for now? 

So we have to assign A, R, O to three distinct positions? 

Possible positions for A: 3,4,5
Possible positions for R: 2,3,5
Possible positions for O: 1,2,4,5

But we have to assign without conflict? 

Also, the word has two more letters? So we need to choose two more letters? 

Let me list possible words? 

We can try to form words with A, R, O and two other letters? 

Common letters left: T, L, D, U, M, P, etc. 

But we need to form a valid English word? 

Also, we can use the position constraints? 

Let me consider the positions:

Case 1: A in position 3? 
    Then R can be in 2 or 5? (since 3 is taken by A? So R cannot be in 3? So R in 2 or 5? 
    Then O can be in 1,2,4,5? But if R is in 2, then O cannot be in 2? So O in 1,4,5? 
    Similarly, if R is in 5, then O can be in 1,2,4? 

Case 2: A in position 4? 
    Then R can be in 2,3,5? 
    O can be in 1,2,5? (since 4 is taken? So O cannot be in 4? 

Case 3: A in position 5? 
    Then R can be in 2,3? (since 5 is taken? So R in 2 or 3? 
    O can be in 1,2,4? (since 5 is taken? 

We need to choose a word that fits? 

Also, we have to pick two more letters? 

Let me think of words that have A, R, O? 

Examples: 
- ROAD? But 4 letters? 
- BROAD? B,R,O,A,D -> positions: B1, R2, O3, A4, D5? 
  Check constraints: 
      A is in 4? -> valid (A can be in 4? 
      R is in 2? -> valid (R can be in 2? 
      O is in 3? -> but in guess2, O was in position 3? And we got O(-) meaning O is not in position 3? So BROAD has O in 3? Which is invalid? Because we know O is not in position 3? 

  So BROAD is invalid? 

- ROAST? But has S? Eliminated? 

- ROAR? Not 5 letters? 

- ROOMY? Has O twice? And no A? 

- AROMA: A,R,O,M,A? But has two A's? And positions: 
        A1, R2, O3, M4, A5? 
  Check constraints: 
        A: in position 1? But from guess2, we know A is not in position 1? Because we got A(-) for position 1? So A cannot be in 1? 
        Also, in AROMA, A is in 1? Which is invalid? 

- FROST? Has S? Eliminated? 

- CROWD? Has C? Eliminated? 

- PROUD? P,R,O,U,D -> positions: P1, R2, O3, U4, D5? 
        O is in position 3? But we know O is not in position 3? So invalid? 

- GROUP? G,R,O,U,P -> O in 3? Again invalid? 

- GROAN? Has N? Eliminated? 

- ROLL? Not 5? 

- ROLE? Has E? Eliminated? 

- ROAD? Too short? 

- BOARD? B,O,A,R,D -> positions: B1, O2, A3, R4, D5? 
        Check: 
            A in 3? -> valid? 
            R in 4? -> but in guess2, we had R in position 4? And we got R(-) meaning R is not in 4? So BOARD has R in 4? Which is invalid? 

- BROAD? We already considered? O in 3? Invalid? 

- ROACH? Has C? Eliminated? 

- ROAST? Has S? 

- ROARS? Has S? 

- PAROL? P,A,R,O,L -> positions: P1, A2, R3, O4, L5? 
        But A in position 2? We know A is not in position 2? From guess1? So invalid? 

- MORAL? M,O,R,A,L -> positions: M1, O2, R3, A4, L5? 
        Check: 
            A in 4? -> valid? 
            R in 3? -> valid? (R can be in 3? 
            O in 2? -> valid? (O can be in 2? 
        Also, avoids I,S,E,C,N? 
        So ""MORAL"" is a candidate? 

But we have to check the feedback? 

In MORAL: 
    M: new? 
    O: in position 2? 
    R: in position 3? 
    A: in position 4? 
    L: new? 

We don't know about M and L? 

But we have to see if it fits? 

Another candidate: 
    ""ROYAL""? R,O,Y,A,L -> positions: R1, O2, Y3, A4, L5? 
        But R in position 1? We know R cannot be in position 1? From guess1? So invalid? 

    ""VOTAR""? Not common? 

    ""DOZAR""? Not common? 

    ""FLOAT""? F,L,O,A,T -> positions: F1, L2, O3, A4, T5? 
        But O in position 3? We know O is not in position 3? So invalid? 

    ""GLOAT""? Same? O in 3? 

    ""BLOAT""? Same? 

    ""COAST""? Has C and S? 

    ""TOPAZ""? T,O,P,A,Z -> positions: T1, O2, P3, A4, Z5? 
        O in 2? -> valid? 
        A in 4? -> valid? 
        But R? We must have R? But TOPAZ has no R? So invalid? 

    ""RADAR""? Has R and A? But no O? We must have O? 

    ""ORGAN""? Has N? Eliminated? 

    ""ARGON""? Has N? 

    ""BARON""? B,A,R,O,N -> has N? Eliminated? 

    ""CAROL""? Has C? 

    ""DROLL""? D,R,O,L,L -> duplicate L? And O in 3? 

    ""DROOP""? O in 3? 

    ""TROLL""? O in 3? 

    ""PROWL""? P,R,O,W,L -> O in 3? 

    ""CROWN""? Has C and N? 

    ""CROAK""? Has C? 

    ""TROOP""? O in 3? 

    ""TROUT""? T,R,O,U,T -> O in 3? 

    ""TROMP""? O in 3? 

    ""TROAD""? Not common? 

    ""TRAWL""? T,R,A,W,L -> positions: T1, R2, A3, W4, L5? 
        Check: 
            A in 3? -> valid? 
            R in 2? -> valid? 
            But O? We must have O? But TRAWL has no O? So invalid? 

    ""CRAWL""? Has C? 

    ""DRAWL""? D,R,A,W,L -> no O? 

    ""GRAIL""? Has I? 

    ""GRAIN""? Has I and N? 

    ""GRAND""? Has N? 

    ""BRAND""? Has N? 

    ""ORATE""? Has E? 

    ""OVARY""? O,V,A,R,Y -> positions: O1, V2, A3, R4, Y5? 
        Check: 
            O in 1? -> valid? (O can be in 1? 
            A in 3? -> valid? 
            R in 4? -> but we know R is not in 4? From guess2? So invalid? 

    ""OVARY"" has R in 4? Which is not allowed? 

    ""OAKUM""? O,A,K,U,M -> no R? 

    ""OARED""? Has E? 

    ""OATER""? O,A,T,E,R -> has E? 

    ""MORAL"" seems to be a good candidate? 

But let me check: 
    M O R A L
    Positions: 
        M:1, O:2, R:3, A:4, L:5

    Constraints:
        A: in 4? -> valid (A can be in 4? 
        R: in 3? -> valid (R can be in 3? 
        O: in 2? -> valid (O can be in 2? 

    And we avoid I,S,E,C,N? 

    So ""MORAL"" is a candidate? 

But we have to see if there are others? 

Another candidate: 
    ""FOLAR""? Not common? 

    ""SOLAR""? Has S? 

    ""POLAR""? P,O,L,A,R -> positions: P1, O2, L3, A4, R5? 
        Check: 
            A in 4? -> valid? 
            R in 5? -> valid? (R can be in 5? 
            O in 2? -> valid? 
        Avoids I,S,E,C,N? 
        So ""POLAR"" is also a candidate? 

    But note: in ""POLAR"", R is in position 5? Which is allowed? 

    Also, ""MORAL"" and ""POLAR"" are both candidates? 

    Another: ""ROTAL""? Not common? 

    ""VOCAL""? Has C? 

    ""LOCAL""? Has C? 

    ""FOCAL""? Has C? 

    ""DOTAL""? D,O,T,A,L -> no R? 

    ""TOTAL""? No R? 

    ""MORAL"" and ""POLAR"" are the two? 

    But we have to choose one? 

    Also, we can consider ""ROBOT""? But O in 3? And has O twice? 

    ""MORAL"" uses M and L? 
    ""POLAR"" uses P and L? 

    We haven't tried M or P? 

    We might want to test more common letters? 

    But we have limited guesses? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more new letters? 

    But we have to include A, R, O? 

    Another candidate: ""ROWDY""? R,O,W,D,Y -> positions: R1, O2, W3, D4, Y5? 
        But R in 1? Invalid? 

    ""DOWRY""? D,O,W,R,Y -> positions: D1, O2, W3, R4, Y5? 
        R in 4? But we know R is not in 4? From guess2? So invalid? 

    ""HOWARD""? Not 5? 

    ""GATOR""? G,A,T,O,R -> positions: G1, A2, T3, O4, R5? 
        But A in 2? We know A is not in 2? So invalid? 

    ""RATIO""? Has I? 

    ""RADIO""? Has I? 

    ""AUDIO""? Has I? 

    ""PATIO""? Has I? 

    ""ORBIT""? Has I? 

    ""FORUM""? F,O,R,U,M -> positions: F1, O2, R3, U4, M5? 
        Check: 
            O in 2? -> valid? 
            R in 3? -> valid? 
            But A? We must have A? But FORUM has no A? So invalid? 

    ""FORM""? Not 5? 

    ""FJORD""? F,J,O,R,D -> no A? 

    ""ABHOR""? We tried? But in guess2 we used ACORN? 

    ""ABHOR"" has A in 1? But we know A is not in 1? 

    So back to ""MORAL"" and ""POLAR""? 

    Let me see which one is more common? 

    We can also consider ""ROTAL""? Not common? 

    ""LORAL""? Not common? 

    ""CORAL""? Has C? 

    ""SORAL""? Has S? 

    ""TORAH""? T,O,R,A,H -> positions: T1, O2, R3, A4, H5? 
        This: 
            O in 2? -> valid? 
            R in 3? -> valid? 
            A in 4? -> valid? 
        Avoids I,S,E,C,N? 
        So ""TORAH"" is a candidate? 

    But is ""TORAH"" a word? It is? 

    So now we have three candidates: 
        MORAL: M1, O2, R3, A4, L5
        POLAR: P1, O2, L3, A4, R5
        TORAH: T1, O2, R3, A4, H5

    We need to choose one? 

    We can choose any? But we want to maximize information? 

    We have to test two new letters? 

    In MORAL: tests M and L? 
    In POLAR: tests P and L? 
    In TORAH: tests T and H? 

    T is a very common letter? So TORAH might be better? 

    Also, H is common? 

    But we have to see? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put O in 2? Because we haven't tested O in other positions? 

    But in TORAH, O is in 2? Which we are testing? 

    We know O is not in 3? But we don't know about 1,2,4,5? 

    In TORAH, we test O in 2? 

    Similarly, in MORAL and POLAR, O is in 2? 

    But we can also test O in other positions? 

    For example, if we put O in position 1? 

    Candidate: ""OCTAN""? Has C and N? 

    ""OPERA""? Has E? 

    ""ORBIT""? Has I? 

    ""OUTDO""? O,U,T,D,O -> duplicate O? And no R? 

    ""OUDRE""? Not common? 

    ""OULONG""? Not 5? 

    ""OUNCE""? Has C and E? 

    ""OLEUM""? Has E? 

    ""OLPAE""? Not common? 

    ""OMBRE""? Has E? 

    ""ONCET""? Has C and E? 

    ""OORAL""? Not common? 

    ""OPAHS""? Has S? 

    ""ORACH""? O,R,A,C,H -> has C? 

    ""ORANG""? Has N? 

    ""ORANT""? Has N? 

    ""ORATE""? Has E? 

    ""ORFES""? Has S? 

    ""ORLOP""? O,R,L,O,P -> duplicate O? 

    ""ORMER""? Has E? 

    ""ORNIS""? Has S? 

    ""ORPIN""? Has N? 

    ""ORRIS""? Has S? 

    ""OSMIC""? Has C? 

    ""OTARY""? O,T,A,R,Y -> positions: O1, T2, A3, R4, Y5? 
        Check: 
            O in 1? -> valid? 
            A in 3? -> valid? 
            R in 4? -> but we know R is not in 4? So invalid? 

    ""OUPHE""? Has E? 

    ""OUTRE""? Has E? 

    ""OVERT""? Has E? 

    ""OWLET""? Has E? 

    ""OXBOW""? No A? 

    So it's hard to find a word with O in 1? 

    Similarly, O in 4? 

    Candidate: ""FOCUS""? Has C? 

    ""LOCUS""? Has C? 

    ""FOLIA""? Has I? 

    ""DOLIA""? Has I? 

    ""COMET""? Has C and E? 

    ""BONUS""? Has N and S? 

    ""TONUS""? Has S? 

    ""LOTUS""? L,O,T,U,S -> has S? 

    ""MOTOR""? M,O,T,O,R -> duplicate O? And no A? 

    ""ROTOR""? No A? 

    ""DONOR""? Has N? 

    ""HONOR""? Has N? 

    ""VOTER""? Has E? 

    ""NOTER""? Has E? 

    ""COVER""? Has C and E? 

    ""MOVER""? Has E? 

    ""ROVER""? Has E? 

    ""DOVER""? Has E? 

    ""HOVER""? Has E? 

    ""LOVER""? Has E? 

    ""POKER""? Has E? 

    ""JOKER""? Has E? 

    ""TOWER""? Has E? 

    ""POWER""? Has E? 

    ""BOXER""? Has E? 

    ""FOYER""? Has E? 

    ""GOYER""? Not common? 

    ""HOYER""? Not common? 

    ""LOYER""? Not common? 

    ""VOYER""? Not common? 

    ""DOYEN""? Has N? 

    ""TOYON""? Has N? 

    ""GAYAL""? No O? 

    So it seems difficult? 

    Therefore, we might stick with the candidates we have: MORAL, POLAR, TORAH? 

    Among these, TORAH has T and H? Which are common? 

    But we have to see? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests a position we haven't tested? 

    For example, we haven't tested position 5 for A? Or position 5 for R? 

    In TORAH: 
        A is in 4? 
        R is in 3? 
        O in 2? 

    In POLAR: 
        A in 4? 
        R in 5? 
        O in 2? 

    In MORAL: 
        A in 4? 
        R in 3? 
        O in 2? 

    So POLAR tests R in 5? Which is a new position? 

    Also, we haven't tested position 5 for R? 

    So POLAR might be better? Because it tests R in 5? 

    Similarly, we haven't tested position 5 for A? But in POLAR, A is in 4? 

    But we can test A in 5? 

    Candidate: ""LARGO""? L,A,R,G,O -> positions: L1, A2, R3, G4, O5? 
        But A in 2? Invalid? 

    ""ARGOT""? A,R,G,O,T -> positions: A1, R2, G3, O4, T5? 
        But A in 1? We know A is not in 1? 

    ""ARGON""? Has N? 

    ""BARGO""? Not common? 

    ""CARGO""? Has C? 

    ""FARGO""? F,A,R,G,O -> positions: F1, A2, R3, G4, O5? 
        A in 2? Invalid? 

    ""MANGY""? Has N? 

    ""PARKA""? P,A,R,K,A -> duplicate A? And A in 2? 

    ""PARGO""? P,A,R,G,O -> A in 2? 

    ""TARGO""? Not common? 

    ""VIRGA""? Has I? 

    ""SORGO""? Has S? 

    ""ORGAN""? Has N? 

    ""ORGAN""? 

    ""ORGIA""? Has I? 

    ""ORGIC""? Has C? 

    ""ORIBI""? Has I? 

    ""ORIEL""? Has E? 

    ""ORLON""? Has N? 

    ""ORLOP""? O,R,L,O,P -> duplicate O? 

    ""ORMOLU""? Not 5? 

    ""ORNERY""? Not 5? 

    ""ORPHAN""? Not 5? 

    ""ORZO""? Not 5? 

    So it's hard to find a word with A in 5? 

    Similarly, R in 5? 

    We have POLAR: R in 5? 

    And we have not tested R in 5? 

    So let's choose POLAR? 

    But note: in POLAR, we have O in 2? Which we are testing? And we have L in 3? And P in 1? 

    We can also consider ""ROTAL""? Not common? 

    I think POLAR is a valid choice? 

    But let me check: 
        P O L A R
        Positions: P1, O2, L3, A4, R5

        Constraints:
            A: in 4? -> valid? 
            R: in 5? -> valid? (we haven't tested position 5 for R? And it's allowed? 
            O: in 2? -> valid? 

        And we avoid I,S,E,C,N? 

        So ""POLAR"" is a good guess? 

    Alternatively, we can choose ""MORAL"" to test M and L? 

    But I think testing R in 5 is valuable? 

    So I'll go with ""POLAR"". 

    But wait, we have to make sure that we are not missing? 

    Another candidate: ""DOULA""? D,O,U,L,A -> no R? 

    ""KOALA""? No R? 

    ""SOLAR""? Has S? 

    ""VOLAR""? V,O,L,A,R -> positions: V1, O2, L3, A4, R5? 
        This is similar to POLAR? But with V? 
        Avoids I,S,E,C,N? 
        So ""VOLAR"" is also a candidate? 

    But ""VOLAR"" is less common? 

    I think ""POLAR"" is better? 

    So let's guess ""POLAR"". 

    But note: we have to consider that we have only 6 guesses? 

    We are on guess 3? 

    So <guess>POLAR</guess> 

    But let me double-check the feedback we have? 

    We know: 
        A is not in 1 or 2? So in 3,4,5? 
        R is not in 1 or 4? So in 2,3,5? 
        O is not in 3? So in 1,2,4,5? 

    In POLAR: 
        A is in 4? -> if it's correct, then we get ✓ for A? 
        R is in 5? -> if it's correct, then ✓? 
        O is in 2? -> if it's correct, then ✓? 

    But if not, we get feedback? 

    We also test P and L? 

    So it's good? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more common letters? Like T? 

    But in TORAH, we have T and H? 

    But TORAH has R in 3? Which we have tested? In guess2, we had R in 4? But not in 3? 

    In guess1, R was in 1? 

    So position 3 for R is untested? 

    Similarly, in TORAH, we test R in 3? 

    And T in 1? 

    And H in 5? 

    And O in 2? 

    And A in 4? 

    So TORAH tests T and H? Which are common? 

    And we test R in 3? 

    But we also test O in 2? 

    And A in 4? 

    So both are good? 

    I think I'll go with TORAH because T is very common? 

    But we have to avoid C,N? 

    TORAH: T,O,R,A,H -> no C,N? 

    So it's valid? 

    And it's a word? 

    Yes, TORAH is a word? 

    So I'll choose TORAH? 

    But let me see the position constraints: 
        T in 1? -> we haven't tested T? 
        O in 2? -> valid? 
        R in 3? -> valid? 
        A in 4? -> valid? 
        H in 5? -> new? 

    And we avoid I,S,E,C,N? 

    So <guess>TORAH</guess> 

    But I'm a bit torn? 

    Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't fix O in 2? But we have to include O? 

    I think TORAH is fine? 

    Let's go with TORAH. 

    But note: in guess2, we had O in position 3? And it was wrong? But in TORAH, O is in 2? Which is new? 

    So we are testing a new position? 

    Similarly, for R: in guess1, R was in 1? In guess2, R was in 4? Now in TORAH, R is in 3? New position? 

    So it's good? 

    So I'll go with TORAH.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R and A are present but misplaced (not in positions 1 or 2), while I, S, and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (ACORN)**: A is present but not in position 1, O is present but not in position 3, R is present but not in position 4, and C and N are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters**: A, R, and O are in the secret word.
- **Absent letters**: I, S, E, C, N (must avoid these).
- **Position constraints**:
  - A: Cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → must be in 3, 4, or 5.
  - R: Cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → must be in 2, 3, or 5.
  - O: Cannot be in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- The secret word has exactly 5 letters, with no duplicates assumed (based on feedback).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Choose a word that includes A, R, and O, avoids I/S/E/C/N, and tests new positions for these letters.
- Prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., T, L, H) to maximize information.
- **TORAH** fits well:
  - Positions: T (1), O (2), R (3), A (4), H (5).
  - Tests A in position 4 (valid per constraints).
  - Tests R in position 3 (valid per constraints).
  - Tests O in position 2 (valid per constraints).
  - Introduces new common letters T and H.
  - Avoids forbidden letters (I/S/E/C/N).

This guess will help narrow down positions for A, R, and O while checking T and H.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This typically means including common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n\nCommon vowels: A, E, I, O, U\nCommon consonants: R, S, T, L, N\n\nA good starting word like ""RAISE"" or ""SLATE"" covers several of these. Let\'s go with ""RAISE"":\n\n- R, A, I, S, E are all common letters.\n- It includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n- This should help us get feedback on multiple frequent letters.\n\nOther strong starters (like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"") are also reasonable, but ""RAISE"" is a classic choice.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess: RAISE → R(-), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)\n Interpretation:\n - R and A are in the secret word but in the wrong position (so they must be present but not in position 1 or 2 respectively).\n - I, S, and E are not in the word at all.\n\n Therefore, we know:\n - The secret word contains R and A.\n - The secret word does not contain I, S, or E.\n - Since R is not in position 1, and A is not in position 2, we must place them elsewhere.\n\n Also, because R and A are present but misplaced, we can infer:\n - R cannot be in the first position, so it must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, but since the word is 5 letters, positions 2 to 5.\n - Similarly, A cannot be in the second position, so it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, A is in the word but not in the second position. It could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n However, note that in the first guess, R was in position 1 and A in position 2, and both were marked as ""-"" meaning wrong position. So:\n - R is in the word but not in position 1.\n - A is in the word but not in position 2.\n\n So A could be in position 1? Let\'s check: if A were in position 1, then in the first guess A was in position 2, which is wrong. But position 1 is open? That\'s possible.\n\n But wait, we have a constraint: if A were in position 1, then in our guess RAISE, the first letter is R, which is wrong, and A would be in position 1 of the secret? Then for the second letter (A in guess), it would be compared to position 2 of secret. Since A is actually in position 1, then for position 2 of guess, it wouldn\'t be A, so the feedback for A would still be ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but not position 2. That\'s consistent.\n\n So A could be in position 1? However, let\'s think about the R: if A were in position 1, then R couldn\'t be in position 1, so R must be elsewhere.\n\n But note: the secret word must have R and A, so we must choose a word that includes R and A, but not I, S, E.\n\n Also, we have eliminated letters: I, S, E are out.\n\n What about other letters? We haven\'t tried many yet.\n\n We should choose a word that has R and A, and avoids I, S, E.\n\n Possible positions for R: 2,3,4,5. Similarly for A: 1,3,4,5 (avoiding position 2).\n\n However, note that A cannot be in 2 and R cannot be in 1.\n\n We need to consider which letters to try next. We have 5 new positions to cover.\n\n Common consonants we haven\'t tried: T, N, L, etc.\n\n Given that we have R and A, we can try a word with T or another vowel? Vowels: we have A (and we know A is present) and we tried E and I, which are out. So remaining vowels: O, U, sometimes Y. But we should avoid using E and I again.\n\n Also, note that we have only 6 guesses.\n\n What words have R and A, but no I, S, E?\n\n Examples: TRACK, TRACT, PARTY, CARDS, but CARDS has S which is eliminated. So avoid S.\n\n Let me think: \n - Words without I, S, E: \n   Must include R and A.\n\n Possible: \n - BOARD? But has O, A, R, B, D. Also, A is in position 2? But we must avoid having A in position 2? No, A cannot be in position 2? Actually, from feedback: in the guess RAISE, the A was in position 2 and was wrong. But the secret word might have A in another position, including position 1? Or anywhere else.\n\n Actually, position 2 in the secret word could be anything as long as it\'s not A? Or if A is elsewhere, then position 2 could have another letter.\n\n But the feedback does not say that position 2 is occupied by some other letter that also prevented A from being there? It only says A is elsewhere.\n\n So for the next guess, we want to:\n   - Include R and A (mandatory).\n   - Exclude I, S, E (since they are not in the word).\n   - Place R not at position 1 and A not at position 2? Actually, we can try to put R in a different position and A in a different position? Yes.\n\n However, we might place A in position 1? Because that\'s not ruled out.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters? We haven\'t checked T, O, U, L, N, C, etc.\n\n Let me consider: a word starting with T? Or something.\n\n Ideal: choose a word that has T, O, N, etc. and includes R and A but placed differently.\n\n Example: \n   TAROT? But has T and O, two T\'s? But let\'s see: avoids I,S,E. Includes A and R. Also positions: \n      T in position 1, A in position 2? But wait, A cannot be in position 2? Actually, we must avoid putting A in position 2? Because in the secret word, A is not in position 2? Correct.\n\n But in our next guess, we can put A in position 2? It wouldn\'t be A in the secret\'s position 2, but we might get feedback that A is in the word but wrong position again? Or if by chance the secret has A in position 2? Then it would be correct? But the feedback said A was wrong position in the first guess, meaning in the secret word, A is not in position 2.\n\n Therefore, we must not put A in position 2 in our guess? Actually, we can put A anywhere we want in the guess to test positions. But if the secret word has A not in position 2, then putting A in position 2 in our guess will yield ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? Or if we put A in position 1 and it\'s actually in position 1, we get a checkmark.\n\n Similarly for R: we must not put R in position 1? Because it\'s wrong? But we can put R elsewhere to see if it fits.\n\n Actually, we must test possible positions for R and A.\n\n Let me list possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5 (since 2 is bad)\n For R: 2,3,4,5 (since 1 is bad)\n\n We need to choose a word that satisfies:\n   Positions: \n        A not in 2? Actually, our guess can have A in 2, but the secret doesn\'t, so it will be marked ""-"". Similarly R in 1 will be marked ""-"", but we know that already so it\'s wasteful to put R in 1? Better to avoid using R in 1 and A in 2? So we can put them in other positions.\n\n However, since we are limited in letters, we might try to maximize information by testing letters we haven\'t tried: T, O, N, L, etc.\n\n I propose a word like ""ROTAN"" but that might not be common. Let\'s think valid words.\n\n Common words: \n   ""PLANT"" - has P, L, A, N, T. But does it include R? No. So not.\n\n   ""CHART"" - has C, H, A, R, T. Positions? \n        C in 1, H in 2, A in 3, R in 4, T in 5.\n        This has A in position 3 and R in position 4? Both are possible? And we avoid I,S,E.\n\n   But does it put A and R in positions we haven\'t tested? And also tests C, H, T.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PARTY"" - has P, A, R, T, Y. But A is in position 2? We shouldn\'t put A in position 2 because we know the secret doesn\'t have A in 2? Actually, we can put A in position 2 to confirm? But it will be wrong. Or we might test it? However, if we put A in position 2, it will give ""-"" for A again? Which doesn\'t give new information? So better to try a new position.\n\n   We want to test A in a different position? So let\'s put A in 3 or 4 or 1? Similarly for R.\n\n   So ""CHART"": A in 3, R in 4? That tests A in position 3 and R in position 4.\n\n   Or ""TRACK"": T in 1, R in 2? But R cannot be in position 1? Well, in this guess, R is in position 2? Which is possible? Secret could have R in position 2? And A in position 3? Then positions: \n        T (position1), R (position2), A (position3), C (position4), K (position5)\n\n   But T, C, K are new letters.\n\n   However, note that if secret has R in position 2, then in our guess we have R in position 2? That would be correct? But we don\'t know.\n\n   Actually, we want to test R in a position we haven\'t tried? Currently we tried R in position 1 (which was wrong). Trying R in position 2 might be useful? Because if it\'s correct, we get a check? But if it\'s still present but elsewhere (e.g., positions 3,4,5) we get ""-"".\n\n   Similarly, for A, we tried position 2 and it was wrong. Now we can try position 3? Or 1?\n\n   So ""TRACK"" might be a good option? But it includes K? Not the most common.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PARTH"" might not be common? \n\n   Let me consider the Wordle dictionary? We need a valid English word.\n\n   Another common word: ""CRANE"" was already used? And we know E is out? So no.\n\n   ""SLATE"" has S and E? Both eliminated? No.\n\n   ""TABLE""? Has E? Eliminated? Table has E? T-A-B-L-E? Yes, E. And S? No, but E is bad.\n\n   Without E: ""ROAST"" has S? Eliminated? S is not allowed.\n\n   So words without E,I,S: \n\n   A common word: ""TAROT"" is in the dictionary? But not in Wordle\'s list? I\'m not sure.\n\n   Another: ""ABOUT"" - does not include R? No.\n\n   ""ALOFT"" - no R.\n\n   ""CAROB""? Has C, A, R, O, B -> but A is in position 2? We want to avoid A in 2? Actually, let me look:\n\n   Words that have R and A, without I,S,E: \n      TORCH? Not C,H? But TORCH: T,O,R,C,H -> no A.\n\n   ""BRAND"" -> B,R,A,N,D. Positions: B first? A in third? So:\n        Positions: B (1), R (2), A (3), N (4), D (5)\n\n   This: \n        Places R in position 2? So if secret has R in position 2, it will be correct. If not, we get ""-"". \n        Places A in position 3? Which hasn\'t been tested? So we can see if A is in position 3?\n\n   Also tests B, N, D.\n\n   ""BRAND"" seems reasonable? But note that feedback about R: if the secret word has R in position 2, we get R(?) as check? Otherwise, if R is elsewhere, we get ""-"".\n\n   Also, B is tested? We don\'t know.\n\n   Similarly, ""CRAMP"" - C,R,A,M,P -> positions: C1,R2,A3,M4,P5 -> again R in 2 and A in 3? But C is used? Also has M and P? Both new.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PARTY"" - P,A,R,T,Y -> A in 2? But we know A is not at 2? So A will be ""-"" again? And R in 3? Then A in 2 is bad? So if we use ""PARTY"", we have A in 2? Which we already know is wrong? So it doesn\'t test a new position for A? That\'s inefficient.\n\n   Therefore, we want a word with A and R in positions that aren\'t eliminated? So avoid A in 2? And avoid R in 1?\n\n   So positions for next guess: \n     Position 1: should not be R? Since we know R isn\'t there? Actually, we might test other letters? Position 1 we haven\'t tested? So we can put a new letter in 1? And put A and R in positions 3,4, or 5? Avoiding 2 for A and 1 for R.\n\n   Let me try to build: \n        Letter1: new letter? Not E,I,S,R? \n        Letter2: cannot be A? So new letter? And not E,I,S? \n        Letter3: could be A? or R?\n        Letter4: could be A? or R? \n        Letter5: could be a new letter?\n\n   Example: \n        ""TOUR"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n        ""HORNY"" -> no A.\n\n        ""PLAIN"" -> has I? And we know I is out.\n\n        ""LAYUP"" -> not in dictionary? \n\n        ""CARTY""? Not a word.\n\n   How about ""PARTY"" but move the positions? But that\'s rearranged to ""PRAT"" (not 5). \n\n   Another idea: ""CARVE"" -> has E? Eliminated? E is out.\n\n   ""MANOR"" -> M,A,N,O,R: positions: M1, A2? But we avoid position 2 for A? So A is in 2? Which is bad? We put A in 2? That\'s okay? We\'ll get ""-"" for A? But we already know that? So putting A in 2 uses up a slot? We want to test new positions? \n\n   We have limited guesses? Try to test A in a new position? For instance, position 1?\n\n   Word with A at position 1? \n        ""AUDIO"" -> eliminated letters? Has I? And we know I is out? Also not including R? \n\n        ""ALERT"" -> has E? Eliminated?\n\n        ""ABHOR"" -> A,B,H,O,R -> positions: A(1), B(2), H(3), O(4), R(5)\n     This: \n        Puts A in position 1? That\'s a new position? We never tested position 1 for A? \n        Puts R in position 5? Also new? We had R in 1? Now in 5? \n        Avoids I, S, E.\n\n     Also tests letters: B, H, O.\n\n     But is ""ABHOR"" a common word? It might be accepted? \n\n     Alternatively, ""ANVIL"" has I? And V? But I is bad.\n\n     ""ADORE"" -> has E? Bad.\n\n     Without E and I: ""ABOIL""? Contains I? \n\n     Another word: ""ACORN"" -> A,C,O,R,N -> positions: A(1), C(2), O(3), R(4), N(5)\n        This has A in 1, R in 4? And tests C, O, N? \n        Avoids E,I,S.\n\n        So ""ACORN"" might be a good choice.\n\n     What about ""ALARM"" -> has A,L,A,R,M? But duplicate A? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But Wordle allows duplicates? Actually, Wordle words can have duplicates? But not often? We haven\'t ruled out duplicates? But no clues so far.\n\n     Actually, the feedback for RAISE: we had R and A and no duplicates? So the secret might have duplicates? Not necessarily? But for information, we avoid duplicates? \n\n     ""ACORN"": A, C, O, R, N - all unique.\n\n     Similarly, ""ABHOR"": A,B,H,O,R - unique.\n\n     I think both are valid. I\'ll choose ""ACORN"".\n\n   Why ""ACORN""?\n        Tests A in position 1 (new, we haven\'t tried) -> if it\'s correct, then ✓, else if A is present but not 1, then ""-"". \n        Tests R in position 4? We haven\'t tried that? Previously R was in 1? Now in 4? \n        Tests C, O, N? All common letters.\n\n   Also, note that we avoid E,I,S? Covered.\n\n   So let\'s go with ""ACORN"".\n\n   Alternative: ""AUDIO"" is bad? Has I? \n\n   So ""ACORN"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R and A are present in the secret word but misplaced (so R is not in position 1, and A is not in position 2).\n- I, S, and E are absent from the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess, we need to:\n1. Include both R and A, as they are confirmed to be in the word.\n2. Avoid I, S, and E entirely.\n3. Test new positions for R and A to gather more locational clues.\n4. Introduce new common letters (like C, O, N) to maximize information.\n\nThe word ""ACORN"" fits perfectly:\n- Places A in position 1 (never tested before) → could reveal if A belongs at the start or is misplaced.\n- Places R in position 4 (unexplored position) → tests a new slot.\n- Introduces C (position 2), O (position 3), and N (position 5) → valuable new letters.\n- Excludes forbidden letters (I, S, E) and adheres to length.\n\n<guess>ACORN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ACORN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (RAISE):\n- R: present but not in position 1 (so in 2,3,4, or 5)\n- A: present but not in position 2 (so in 1,3,4, or 5)\n- I: absent\n- S: absent\n- E: absent\n\nFrom Guess 2 (ACORN):\n- A: present but not in position 1 (so in 3,4, or 5) — note: we already knew A is not in 2, and now we know it\'s also not in 1?

But let\'s assume no duplicates for now? \n\nSo we have to assign A, R, O to three distinct positions? \n\nPossible positions for A: 3,4,5\nPossible positions for R: 2,3,5\nPossible positions for O: 1,2,4,5\n\nBut we have to assign without conflict? \n\nAlso, the word has two more letters? So we need to choose two more letters? \n\nLet me list possible words? \n\nWe can try to form words with A, R, O and two other letters? \n\nCommon letters left: T, L, D, U, M, P, etc. \n\nBut we need to form a valid English word? \n\nAlso, we can use the position constraints? \n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\nCase 1: A in position 3? \n    Then R can be in 2 or 5? (since 3 is taken by A? So R cannot be in 3? So R in 2 or 5? \n    Then O can be in 1,2,4,5? But if R is in 2, then O cannot be in 2? So O in 1,4,5? \n    Similarly, if R is in 5, then O can be in 1,2,4? \n\nCase 2: A in position 4? \n    Then R can be in 2,3,5? \n    O can be in 1,2,5? (since 4 is taken? So O cannot be in 4? \n\nCase 3: A in position 5? \n    Then R can be in 2,3? (since 5 is taken? So R in 2 or 3? \n    O can be in 1,2,4? (since 5 is taken? \n\nWe need to choose a word that fits? \n\nAlso, we have to pick two more letters? \n\nLet me think of words that have A, R, O? \n\nExamples: \n- ROAD? But 4 letters? \n- BROAD? B,R,O,A,D -> positions: B1, R2, O3, A4, D5? \n  Check constraints: \n      A is in 4? -> valid (A can be in 4? \n      R is in 2? -> valid (R can be in 2? \n      O is in 3? -> but in guess2, O was in position 3? And we got O(-) meaning O is not in position 3? So BROAD has O in 3? Which is invalid? Because we know O is not in position 3? \n\n  So BROAD is invalid? \n\n- ROAST? But has S? Eliminated? \n\n- ROAR? Not 5 letters? \n\n- ROOMY? Has O twice? And no A? \n\n- AROMA: A,R,O,M,A? But has two A\'s? And positions: \n        A1, R2, O3, M4, A5? \n  Check constraints: \n        A: in position 1? But from guess2, we know A is not in position 1? Because we got A(-) for position 1? So A cannot be in 1? \n        Also, in AROMA, A is in 1? Which is invalid? \n\n- FROST? Has S? Eliminated? \n\n- CROWD? Has C? Eliminated? \n\n- PROUD? P,R,O,U,D -> positions: P1, R2, O3, U4, D5? \n        O is in position 3? But we know O is not in position 3? So invalid? \n\n- GROUP? G,R,O,U,P -> O in 3? Again invalid? \n\n- GROAN? Has N? Eliminated? \n\n- ROLL? Not 5? \n\n- ROLE? Has E? Eliminated? \n\n- ROAD? Too short? \n\n- BOARD? B,O,A,R,D -> positions: B1, O2, A3, R4, D5? \n        Check: \n            A in 3? -> valid? \n            R in 4? -> but in guess2, we had R in position 4? And we got R(-) meaning R is not in 4? So BOARD has R in 4? Which is invalid? \n\n- BROAD? We already considered? O in 3? Invalid? \n\n- ROACH? Has C? Eliminated? \n\n- ROAST? Has S? \n\n- ROARS? Has S? \n\n- PAROL? P,A,R,O,L -> positions: P1, A2, R3, O4, L5? \n        But A in position 2? We know A is not in position 2? From guess1? So invalid? \n\n- MORAL? M,O,R,A,L -> positions: M1, O2, R3, A4, L5? \n        Check: \n            A in 4? -> valid? \n            R in 3? -> valid? (R can be in 3? \n            O in 2? -> valid? (O can be in 2? \n        Also, avoids I,S,E,C,N? \n        So ""MORAL"" is a candidate? \n\nBut we have to check the feedback? \n\nIn MORAL: \n    M: new? \n    O: in position 2? \n    R: in position 3? \n    A: in position 4? \n    L: new? \n\nWe don\'t know about M and L? \n\nBut we have to see if it fits? \n\nAnother candidate: \n    ""ROYAL""? R,O,Y,A,L -> positions: R1, O2, Y3, A4, L5? \n        But R in position 1? We know R cannot be in position 1? From guess1? So invalid? \n\n    ""VOTAR""? Not common? \n\n    ""DOZAR""? Not common? \n\n    ""FLOAT""? F,L,O,A,T -> positions: F1, L2, O3, A4, T5? \n        But O in position 3? We know O is not in position 3? So invalid? \n\n    ""GLOAT""? Same? O in 3? \n\n    ""BLOAT""? Same? \n\n    ""COAST""? Has C and S? \n\n    ""TOPAZ""?

But no O? We must have O? \n\n    ""ORGAN""? Has N? Eliminated? \n\n    ""ARGON""? Has N? \n\n    ""BARON""? B,A,R,O,N -> has N? Eliminated? \n\n    ""CAROL""? Has C? \n\n    ""DROLL""? D,R,O,L,L -> duplicate L? And O in 3? \n\n    ""DROOP""? O in 3? \n\n    ""TROLL""? O in 3? \n\n    ""PROWL""? P,R,O,W,L -> O in 3? \n\n    ""CROWN""? Has C and N? \n\n    ""CROAK""? Has C? \n\n    ""TROOP""? O in 3? \n\n    ""TROUT""? T,R,O,U,T -> O in 3? \n\n    ""TROMP""? O in 3? \n\n    ""TROAD""? Not common? \n\n    ""TRAWL""? T,R,A,W,L -> positions: T1, R2, A3, W4, L5? \n        Check: \n            A in 3? -> valid? \n            R in 2? -> valid? \n            But O? We must have O? But TRAWL has no O? So invalid? \n\n    ""CRAWL""? Has C? \n\n    ""DRAWL""? D,R,A,W,L -> no O? \n\n    ""GRAIL""? Has I? \n\n    ""GRAIN""? Has I and N? \n\n    ""GRAND""? Has N? \n\n    ""BRAND""?

(O can be in 1? \n            A in 3? -> valid? \n            R in 4? -> but we know R is not in 4? From guess2? So invalid? \n\n    ""OVARY"" has R in 4? Which is not allowed? \n\n    ""OAKUM""? O,A,K,U,M -> no R? \n\n    ""OARED""? Has E? \n\n    ""OATER""? O,A,T,E,R -> has E? \n\n    ""MORAL"" seems to be a good candidate? \n\nBut let me check: \n    M O R A L\n    Positions: \n        M:1, O:2, R:3, A:4, L:5\n\n    Constraints:\n        A: in 4? -> valid (A can be in 4? \n        R: in 3? -> valid (R can be in 3? \n        O: in 2? -> valid (O can be in 2? \n\n    And we avoid I,S,E,C,N? \n\n    So ""MORAL"" is a candidate? \n\nBut we have to see if there are others? \n\nAnother candidate: \n    ""FOLAR""? Not common? \n\n    ""SOLAR""? Has S? \n\n    ""POLAR""? P,O,L,A,R -> positions: P1, O2, L3, A4, R5? \n        Check: \n            A in 4? -> valid? \n            R in 5? -> valid? (R can be in 5? \n            O in 2? -> valid? \n        Avoids I,S,E,C,N? \n        So ""POLAR"" is also a candidate? \n\n    But note: in ""POLAR"", R is in position 5? Which is allowed? \n\n    Also, ""MORAL"" and ""POLAR"" are both candidates? \n\n    Another: ""ROTAL""? Not common? \n\n    ""VOCAL""? Has C? \n\n    ""LOCAL""? Has C? \n\n    ""FOCAL""? Has C? \n\n    ""DOTAL""? D,O,T,A,L -> no R? \n\n    ""TOTAL""? No R? \n\n    ""MORAL"" and ""POLAR"" are the two? \n\n    But we have to choose one? \n\n    Also, we can consider ""ROBOT""? But O in 3? And has O twice? \n\n    ""MORAL"" uses M and L? \n    ""POLAR"" uses P and L? \n\n    We haven\'t tried M or P? \n\n    We might want to test more common letters? \n\n    But we have limited guesses? \n\n    Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more new letters? \n\n    But we have to include A, R, O? \n\n    Another candidate: ""ROWDY""? R,O,W,D,Y -> positions: R1, O2, W3, D4, Y5? \n        But R in 1? Invalid? \n\n    ""DOWRY""? D,O,W,R,Y -> positions: D1, O2, W3, R4, Y5? \n        R in 4? But we know R is not in 4? From guess2? So invalid? \n\n    ""HOWARD""? Not 5? \n\n    ""GATOR""? G,A,T,O,R -> positions: G1, A2, T3, O4, R5? \n        But A in 2? We know A is not in 2? So invalid? \n\n    ""RATIO""? Has I? \n\n    ""RADIO""? Has I? \n\n    ""AUDIO""? Has I? \n\n    ""PATIO""? Has I? \n\n    ""ORBIT""? Has I? \n\n    ""FORUM""? F,O,R,U,M -> positions: F1, O2, R3, U4, M5? \n        Check: \n            O in 2? -> valid? \n            R in 3? -> valid? \n            But A? We must have A? But FORUM has no A? So invalid? \n\n    ""FORM""? Not 5? \n\n    ""FJORD""? F,J,O,R,D -> no A? \n\n    ""ABHOR""? We tried? But in guess2 we used ACORN? \n\n    ""ABHOR"" has A in 1? But we know A is not in 1? \n\n    So back to ""MORAL"" and ""POLAR""? \n\n    Let me see which one is more common? \n\n    We can also consider ""ROTAL""? Not common? \n\n    ""LORAL""? Not common? \n\n    ""CORAL""? Has C? \n\n    ""SORAL""? Has S? \n\n    ""TORAH""? T,O,R,A,H -> positions: T1, O2, R3, A4, H5? \n        This: \n            O in 2? -> valid? \n            R in 3? -> valid? \n            A in 4? -> valid? \n        Avoids I,S,E,C,N? \n        So ""TORAH"" is a candidate? \n\n    But is ""TORAH"" a word? It is? \n\n    So now we have three candidates: \n        MORAL: M1, O2, R3, A4, L5\n        POLAR: P1, O2, L3, A4, R5\n        TORAH: T1, O2, R3, A4, H5\n\n    We need to choose one? \n\n    We can choose any? But we want to maximize information? \n\n    We have to test two new letters? \n\n    In MORAL: tests M and L? \n    In POLAR: tests P and L? \n    In TORAH: tests T and H? \n\n    T is a very common letter? So TORAH might be better? \n\n    Also, H is common? \n\n    But we have to see? \n\n    Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put O in 2? Because we haven\'t tested O in other positions? \n\n    But in TORAH, O is in 2? Which we are testing? \n\n    We know O is not in 3? But we don\'t know about 1,2,4,5? \n\n    In TORAH, we test O in 2? \n\n    Similarly, in MORAL and POLAR, O is in 2? \n\n    But we can also test O in other positions? \n\n    For example, if we put O in position 1? \n\n    Candidate: ""OCTAN""? Has C and N? \n\n    ""OPERA""? Has E? \n\n    ""ORBIT""? Has I? \n\n    ""OUTDO""? O,U,T,D,O -> duplicate O? And no R? \n\n    ""OUDRE""? Not common? \n\n    ""OULONG""? Not 5? \n\n    ""OUNCE""? Has C and E? \n\n    ""OLEUM""? Has E? \n\n    ""OLPAE""? Not common? \n\n    ""OMBRE""? Has E? \n\n    ""ONCET""? Has C and E? \n\n    ""OORAL""? Not common? \n\n    ""OPAHS""? Has S? \n\n    ""ORACH""? O,R,A,C,H -> has C? \n\n    ""ORANG""? Has N? \n\n    ""ORANT""? Has N? \n\n    ""ORATE""? Has E? \n\n    ""ORFES""? Has S? \n\n    ""ORLOP""? O,R,L,O,P -> duplicate O? \n\n    ""ORMER""? Has E? \n\n    ""ORNIS""? Has S? \n\n    ""ORPIN""? Has N? \n\n    ""ORRIS""? Has S? \n\n    ""OSMIC""? Has C? \n\n    ""OTARY""? O,T,A,R,Y -> positions: O1, T2, A3, R4, Y5? \n        Check: \n            O in 1? -> valid? \n            A in 3? -> valid? \n            R in 4? -> but we know R is not in 4? So invalid? \n\n    ""OUPHE""? Has E? \n\n    ""OUTRE""? Has E? \n\n    ""OVERT""? Has E? \n\n    ""OWLET""? Has E? \n\n    ""OXBOW""? No A? \n\n    So it\'s hard to find a word with O in 1? \n\n    Similarly, O in 4? \n\n    Candidate: ""FOCUS""? Has C? \n\n    ""LOCUS""? Has C? \n\n    ""FOLIA""? Has I? \n\n    ""DOLIA""? Has I? \n\n    ""COMET""? Has C and E? \n\n    ""BONUS""? Has N and S? \n\n    ""TONUS""? Has S? \n\n    ""LOTUS""? L,O,T,U,S -> has S? \n\n    ""MOTOR""? M,O,T,O,R -> duplicate O? And no A? \n\n    ""ROTOR""? No A? \n\n    ""DONOR""? Has N? \n\n    ""HONOR""? Has N? \n\n    ""VOTER""? Has E? \n\n    ""NOTER""? Has E? \n\n    ""COVER""? Has C and E? \n\n    ""MOVER""? Has E? \n\n    ""ROVER""? Has E? \n\n    ""DOVER""? Has E? \n\n    ""HOVER""? Has E? \n\n    ""LOVER""? Has E? \n\n    ""POKER""? Has E? \n\n    ""JOKER""? Has E? \n\n    ""TOWER""? Has E? \n\n    ""POWER""? Has E? \n\n    ""BOXER""? Has E? \n\n    ""FOYER""? Has E? \n\n    ""GOYER""? Not common? \n\n    ""HOYER""? Not common? \n\n    ""LOYER""? Not common? \n\n    ""VOYER""? Not common? \n\n    ""DOYEN""? Has N? \n\n    ""TOYON""? Has N? \n\n    ""GAYAL""? No O? \n\n    So it seems difficult? \n\n    Therefore, we might stick with the candidates we have: MORAL, POLAR, TORAH? \n\n    Among these, TORAH has T and H? Which are common? \n\n    But we have to see? \n\n    Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests a position we haven\'t tested? \n\n    For example, we haven\'t tested position 5 for A? Or position 5 for R? \n\n    In TORAH: \n        A is in 4? \n        R is in 3? \n        O in 2? \n\n    In POLAR: \n        A in 4? \n        R in 5? \n        O in 2? \n\n    In MORAL: \n        A in 4? \n        R in 3? \n        O in 2? \n\n    So POLAR tests R in 5? Which is a new position? \n\n    Also, we haven\'t tested position 5 for R? \n\n    So POLAR might be better? Because it tests R in 5? \n\n    Similarly, we haven\'t tested position 5 for A? But in POLAR, A is in 4? \n\n    But we can test A in 5? \n\n    Candidate: ""LARGO""? L,A,R,G,O -> positions: L1, A2, R3, G4, O5? \n        But A in 2? Invalid? \n\n    ""ARGOT""? A,R,G,O,T -> positions: A1, R2, G3, O4, T5? \n        But A in 1? We know A is not in 1? \n\n    ""ARGON""? Has N? \n\n    ""BARGO""? Not common? \n\n    ""CARGO""? Has C? \n\n    ""FARGO""? F,A,R,G,O -> positions: F1, A2, R3, G4, O5? \n        A in 2? Invalid? \n\n    ""MANGY""? Has N? \n\n    ""PARKA""? P,A,R,K,A -> duplicate A? And A in 2? \n\n    ""PARGO""? P,A,R,G,O -> A in 2? \n\n    ""TARGO""? Not common? \n\n    ""VIRGA""? Has I? \n\n    ""SORGO""? Has S? \n\n    ""ORGAN""? Has N? \n\n    ""ORGAN""? \n\n    ""ORGIA""? Has I? \n\n    ""ORGIC""? Has C? \n\n    ""ORIBI""? Has I? \n\n    ""ORIEL""? Has E? \n\n    ""ORLON""? Has N? \n\n    ""ORLOP""? O,R,L,O,P -> duplicate O? \n\n    ""ORMOLU""? Not 5? \n\n    ""ORNERY""? Not 5? \n\n    ""ORPHAN""? Not 5? \n\n    ""ORZO""? Not 5? \n\n    So it\'s hard to find a word with A in 5? \n\n    Similarly, R in 5? \n\n    We have POLAR: R in 5? \n\n    And we have not tested R in 5? \n\n    So let\'s choose POLAR? \n\n    But note: in POLAR, we have O in 2? Which we are testing? And we have L in 3? And P in 1? \n\n    We can also consider ""ROTAL""? Not common? \n\n    I think POLAR is a valid choice? \n\n    But let me check: \n        P O L A R\n        Positions: P1, O2, L3, A4, R5\n\n        Constraints:\n            A: in 4? -> valid? \n            R: in 5? -> valid? (we haven\'t tested position 5 for R? And it\'s allowed? \n            O: in 2? -> valid? \n\n        And we avoid I,S,E,C,N? \n\n        So ""POLAR"" is a good guess? \n\n    Alternatively, we can choose ""MORAL"" to test M and L? \n\n    But I think testing R in 5 is valuable? \n\n    So I\'ll go with ""POLAR"". \n\n    But wait, we have to make sure that we are not missing? \n\n    Another candidate: ""DOULA""? D,O,U,L,A -> no R? \n\n    ""KOALA""? No R? \n\n    ""SOLAR""? Has S? \n\n    ""VOLAR""? V,O,L,A,R -> positions: V1, O2, L3, A4, R5? \n        This is similar to POLAR? But with V? \n        Avoids I,S,E,C,N? \n        So ""VOLAR"" is also a candidate? \n\n    But ""VOLAR"" is less common? \n\n    I think ""POLAR"" is better? \n\n    So let\'s guess ""POLAR"". \n\n    But note: we have to consider that we have only 6 guesses? \n\n    We are on guess 3? \n\n    So <guess>POLAR</guess> \n\n    But let me double-check the feedback we have? \n\n    We know: \n        A is not in 1 or 2? So in 3,4,5? \n        R is not in 1 or 4? So in 2,3,5? \n        O is not in 3? So in 1,2,4,5? \n\n    In POLAR: \n        A is in 4? -> if it\'s correct, then we get ✓ for A? \n        R is in 5? -> if it\'s correct, then ✓? \n        O is in 2? -> if it\'s correct, then ✓? \n\n    But if not, we get feedback? \n\n    We also test P and L? \n\n    So it\'s good? \n\n    Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more common letters? Like T? \n\n    But in TORAH, we have T and H? \n\n    But TORAH has R in 3? Which we have tested? In guess2, we had R in 4? But not in 3? \n\n    In guess1, R was in 1? \n\n    So position 3 for R is untested? \n\n    Similarly, in TORAH, we test R in 3? \n\n    And T in 1? \n\n    And H in 5? \n\n    And O in 2? \n\n    And A in 4? \n\n    So TORAH tests T and H? Which are common? \n\n    And we test R in 3? \n\n    But we also test O in 2? \n\n    And A in 4? \n\n    So both are good? \n\n    I think I\'ll go with TORAH because T is very common? \n\n    But we have to avoid C,N? \n\n    TORAH: T,O,R,A,H -> no C,N? \n\n    So it\'s valid? \n\n    And it\'s a word? \n\n    Yes, TORAH is a word? \n\n    So I\'ll choose TORAH? \n\n    But let me see the position constraints: \n        T in 1? -> we haven\'t tested T? \n        O in 2? -> valid? \n        R in 3? -> valid? \n        A in 4? -> valid? \n        H in 5? -> new? \n\n    And we avoid I,S,E,C,N? \n\n    So <guess>TORAH</guess> \n\n    But I\'m a bit torn? \n\n    Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t fix O in 2? But we have to include O? \n\n    I think TORAH is fine? \n\n    Let\'s go with TORAH. \n\n    But note: in guess2, we had O in position 3? And it was wrong? But in TORAH, O is in 2? Which is new? \n\n    So we are testing a new position? \n\n    Similarly, for R: in guess1, R was in 1? In guess2, R was in 4? Now in TORAH, R is in 3? New position? \n\n    So it\'s good? \n\n    So I\'ll go with TORAH.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R and A are present but misplaced (not in positions 1 or 2), while I, S, and E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (ACORN)**: A is present but not in position 1, O is present but not in position 3, R is present but not in position 4, and C and N are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed letters**: A, R, and O are in the secret word.\n- **Absent letters**: I, S, E, C, N (must avoid these).\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - A: Cannot be in positions 1 or 2 → must be in 3, 4, or 5.\n  - R: Cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → must be in 2, 3, or 5.\n  - O: Cannot be in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n- The secret word has exactly 5 letters, with no duplicates assumed (based on feedback).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Choose a word that includes A, R, and O, avoids I/S/E/C/N, and tests new positions for these letters.\n- Prioritize testing common unused letters (e.g., T, L, H) to maximize information.\n- **TORAH** fits well:\n  - Positions: T (1), O (2), R (3), A (4), H (5).\n  - Tests A in position 4 (valid per constraints).\n  - Tests R in position 3 (valid per constraints).\n  - Tests O in position 2 (valid per constraints).\n  - Introduces new common letters T and H.\n  - Avoids forbidden letters (I/S/E/C/N).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down positions for A, R, and O while checking T and H.\n\n<guess>POLAR</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ACORN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x)\nGuess 3: POLAR -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) L(x) A(-) R(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from the three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
Meaning: 
  - R is in the word, but not at position 1.
  - A is in the word, but not at position 2.
  - I, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ACORN -> A(-), C(x), O(-), R(-), N(x)
Meaning:
  - A is in the word, but not at position 1 (so combined with Guess1, A is not at position 1 or 2 -> must be at 3, 4, or 5).
  - C and N are not in the word.
  - O is in the word, but not at position 3.
  - R is in the word, but not at position 4.

Guess 3: POLAR -> P(x), O(-), L(x), A(-), R(-)
Meaning:
  - P and L are not in the word.
  - O is in the word, but not at position 2 (this is new).
  - A is in the word, but not at position 4? Wait: A is at position 4 in this guess? And we get A(-), meaning A is in the word but not at position 4? 
  - R is in the word, but not at position 5? Because R is at position 5 in this guess? And we get R(-), meaning R is in the word but not at position 5? 

So let's update the position constraints:

From Guess1: 
   R not at 1, A not at 2.

From Guess2:
   A not at 1 -> so A must be at 3,4, or 5? But now from Guess3, we have more? 
      In POLAR, A was at position 4 and we got A(-)? So A is not at position 4? 
   Similarly, R not at 4? And from Guess3: R at position 5 -> R(-)? So R not at 5? 
   Also O not at 3? And from Guess3: O was at position 2 -> O(-)? So O is not at position 2? 

Therefore:

A positions: 
   Not at 1 (guess2), not at 2 (guess1), not at 4 (guess3) -> so A must be at position 3 or 5? 

R positions:
   Not at 1 (guess1), not at 4 (guess2), not at 5 (guess3) -> so R must be at position 2 or 3? 

O positions:
   Not at 3 (guess2), not at 2 (guess3) -> so O must be at position 1, 4, or 5? 

Also, we know the word contains A, R, O? Because they are marked as present? 

And the absent letters: I, S, E, C, N, P, L? 

So the word must have A, R, O, and two other letters? 

But we also know that the secret word has 5 letters? And we must avoid I,S,E,C,N,P,L? 

Available letters? 

We have tested:
  Letters in the word (present): A, R, O? 
  Letters not in the word: I, S, E, C, N, P, L.

So common letters left? T, U, D, M, B, G, K, H, Y, W, F, V, Z, etc.? 

Now, we need to form a word with A, R, O and two of the remaining letters? 

And also satisfy the position constraints:

   A must be at 3 or 5.
   R must be at 2 or 3.
   O must be at 1,4,5.

But if A is at 3 and R is at 2? That's okay? Or if A is at 3 and R is at 3? That can't be because one position? 

So:

Case 1: A at position 3? 
   Then R must be at 2 (because not at 3? because occupied by A? One letter per position? 
   Then O must be at 1,4,5? 

   So word: [O?] [R] [A] [?] [?] or [O?] [R] [A] [O?] [?] or [O?] [R] [A] [?] [O?] 

   But O cannot be at 2? And R is at 2? So O not at 2 okay? 

Case 2: A at position 5?
   Then R must be at 2 or 3? 
   O can be at 1,4? (since position 5 is taken by A? So O not at 5? 

   So:
      If R at 2: word: [O?] [R] [?] [O?] [A]? 
      If R at 3: word: [O?] [?] [R] [O?] [A]?

Now, we need to fill in the other positions? 

Also, we have to include only one? O? Or duplicates? But we haven't had duplicate clues? So let's assume no duplicates? 

So let's form words? 

First, case 1: A at 3, R at 2, O at 1,4, or 5? 

But O can be at 1,4,5? 

If O at 1: then word: O, R, A, ?, ??
   The last two not I,S,E,C,N,P,L? And must be two different letters? 

   Example: ORA?? 

   Possible: ORATE? But E is out? 
            ORACY? C is out? 
            ORALE? E? 
            ORAXY? Not common? 
            ORANG? N? 
            ORALS? S? 
            ORANT? N? 
            So no? 

If O at 4: then word: [ ? ] , R, A, O, [ ? ] 

   Positions: 
      Position 1: ? 
      Position 2: R
      Position 3: A
      Position 4: O
      Position 5: ?

   We need a word: ? R A O ? 

   Avoid I,S,E,C,N,P,L? 

   Common words: 
      ""DRAKE"" -> E? 
      ""DRAPE"" -> E, P? 
      ""GRAVE"" -> E? 
      ""BRAKE"" -> E? 
      ""CRAZE"" -> E? 
      ""TRACE"" -> E? 
      ""FRAME"" -> E? 
      ""GRADE"" -> E? 
      ""GRACE"" -> E? 

      Without E: 
        ""BRAVO"" -> B,R,A,V,O -> positions: B1, R2, A3, V4, O5? But we want O at 4? 
          BRAVO: positions: B1, R2, A3, V4, O5? So V4? But we need O at 4? 
          So ""BRAVO"" has O at 5? Not at 4? 

        ""KRAUT"" -> K,R,A,U,T? But U4? Not O? 

        How about ""FRAUD""? F,R,A,U,D -> has U4? 
          We want O at 4? So not? 

        ""CRAWL"" -> C? and L? 
        ""DRAWL"" -> L? 

        So the only one I can think is ""??RAO?"" and then the fifth letter? But we need two letters? 

        The candidate: ? R A O ? 

        We need a valid word? 

        ""PROA?"" not. 

        ""GROAN"" -> has G,R,O,A,N? But positions: G1, R2, O3? But we need O at 4? 

        Actually, no word? 

        What's a word with letters ending with O? 

        ""TORAO""? Not common? 

        ""CURAO""? Has C? 

        ""DRAOO""? Not a word. 

O at 5: then word: [ ? ] , R, A, ? , O

   So pattern: _ R A _ O

   Words: 
      ""DRAXO""? Not common? 
      ""GRAPO""? Has P? 
      ""TRAVO""? T,R,A,V,O? Positions: T1, R2, A3, V4, O5? 
          So ""TRAVO""? Is this a word? It might be Travo? Not common? 
      ""BRAVO""? B1,R2,A3,V4,O5? 
          So ""BRAVO"" fits the pattern? But does it avoid? B,R,A,V,O? V is allowed? 
          And we avoid I,S,E,C,N,P,L? Yes? 

      So ""BRAVO"" is a candidate? 

      But we must have O? And in BRAVO, O is at position 5? Which is okay? 

      But note: O is also in the word? But at position 5? 

      And A is at position 3? 
      R at position 2? 

      And we have B and V? 

      Also, O must be at position 1,4,5? Here we put O at 5? So valid? 

      And R at 2? Valid? 
      A at 3? Valid? 

      So ""BRAVO"" is a candidate? 

Now case 2: A at position 5? 

Then R must be at 2 or 3? 

Subcase 2.1: R at 2? 
   Then O must be at 1 or 4? 
   Word: O? R ? ? A   or   ? R ? O A

   First: O at position 1: O, R, ?, ?, A -> pattern: O R _ _ A
        Words: 
          ""ORLON"" -> L? and N? 
          ""ORMER"" -> E? 
          ""ORVAL"" -> L? 
          ""ORXY?"" -> X,Y? 
          ""OPTMA""? No? 
        Common: ""ORTHA""? Not? 
                ""ORNA""? N? 

   Second: O at position 4: ? , R, ?, O, A
        Pattern: _ R _ O A
        Words: 
          ""ARTZO""? Not? 
          ""ARTOO""? Duplicate? 
          ""BROOD""? Has B? O duplicate? 
          ""CROWD""? C? 
          ""DROID""? I? 
          ""GROUT""? G,R,O,U,T? -> U3? 
          ""FROST""? S? 
          ""WRONG""? W,R,O,N,G? -> N? 
          ""PROOF""? P? 
          ""TROOP""? T,R,O,O,P? -> duplicate O? and P? 
          ""BROAD""? B,R,O,A,D? -> positions: B1,R2,O3? But we want O at 4? So not? 

          How about ""GRUOA""? Not? 

        So hard to find? 

Subcase 2.2: A at 5, R at 3? 
   Then O must be at 1 or 4? 
   Word: O ? R ? A   or   ? ? R O A

   First: O at 1: O, ?, R, ?, A -> pattern: O _ R _ A
        Words: 
          ""OARED"" -> E? 
          ""OATER"" -> E? 
          ""ORDER"" -> E? 
          ""OTHER"" -> T,H? -> O,T,H,E,R? But E? 
          ""OUZEL"" -> U,Z,E? 
          ""OFFER"" -> E? 
          ""OCTAR""? C? 
          ""OMBRA""? M,B? -> O,M,B,R,A? positions: O1,M2,B3,R4,A5? 
            But R must be at position 3? So not? 
          ""OUNCRY""? Not 5? 

   Second: O at 4: ? , ? , R, O, A -> pattern: _ _ R O A
        Words: 
          ""BAROA""? Not? 
          ""CAROA""? C? 
          ""PAROA""? P? 
          ""TAROA""? T1,A2,R3,O4,A5? But A twice? 
          ""VEROA""? E? 
          ""MAROA""? M1,A2,R3,O4,A5? Duplicate A? 
          ""BUT T? 

        Common: ""MIHRA""? Not? 
                ""TERRA"" -> E? and duplicate R? 
                ""FERRO"" -> E? 
                ""SAROS"" -> S? 
                ""HERON"" -> E? and N? 

        So no? 

Therefore, the only candidate we have so far is ""BRAVO"" from case 1? 

But let's confirm:

   BRAVO: 
        B1, R2, A3, V4, O5.

   Constraints:
        A? position 3: valid (A can be in 3? 
        R? position 2: valid (R can be in 2? 
        O? position 5: valid (O can be in 5? 

   And O must be at 1,4,5? Here 5? 

   And absent letters: B and V? We haven't eliminated them? 

   And the word: BRAVO? is it valid? 

   Yes, means a shout? 

   Also, we must check: any other possibilities? 

   Another candidate: 

   In case 1, with O at position 5: we have pattern ? R A ? O? But in ""BRAVO"", we have ? R A V O? That's B R A V O? 

   Are there others? 

   Like G R A Y O? But Y? 

   P R A C O? But C? 

   D R A W O? But W? 

   But we need a valid word? 

   BRAVO is one? 

   Also, what about if O is at position 1? In case 1 with A at 3 and R at 2? 

   We tried and didn't find a common word? 

   Or if O is at 4? 

   Example: O R A O B? But duplicate O? 

   So for now, BRAVO is the candidate? 

But let me double-check: 

   We have another possibility: 

   What if O is at position 4? 

   In case 1: A at 3, R at 2, O at 4: so pattern: ? R A O ? 

   Words: 
        GRAO?? 
        BRAO?? 
        DRAO?? 

   No common? 

   Also, O at 5: BRAVO.

   But note: the secret word could have more letters? 

   Maybe there are duplicates? We haven't ruled out? 

   But in feedback, we haven't had a duplicate? 

   For example, in RAISE: A and R were present once? 

   Similarly, in ACORN: A,O,R? Present? 

   In POLAR: O,A,R? 

   So assume one each? 

   So BRAVO: is a word with distinct letters? 

   But B and V? 

   So we guess BRAVO? 

   But we must also note: from Guess3, we learned that O is not at 2? So in BRAVO, O is at 5? 

   And V is new? 

   Also B? 

   So let's go with BRAVO. 

   But wait: in case 2: A at 5? 

   We didn't find a word? 

   But maybe ""TOROA"" not? 

   Or ""MOROA""? 

   Or ""ARROW""? A,R,R,O,W? Duplicate R? And positions: A1,R2,R3,O4,W5? But R at position 2 and 3? But we need one R? 

   So invalid? 

   Therefore, BRAVO is the best candidate? 

   So <guess>BRAVO</guess> 

   But note: we must check if V is allowed? 

   V is not eliminated? 

   Yes? 

   So I'll go with BRAVO. 

   Alternatively, we can consider ""GROAN"" but has N? 

   Or ""ROBOT"" but O at 3? Not allowed? 

   So BRAVO.
</think>
### Previous Feedback Analysis:

**Guess 1: RAISE → R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)**  
- R: Present but not in position 1.  
- A: Present but not in position 2.  
- I, S, E: Absent.  

**Guess 2: ACORN → A(-) C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x)**  
- A: Present but not in position 1 (combined with Guess 1, cannot be in 1 or 2 → must be 3, 4, or 5).  
- C, N: Absent.  
- O: Present but not in position 3.  
- R: Present but not in position 4.  

**Guess 3: POLAR → P(x) O(-) L(x) A(-) R(-)**  
- P, L: Absent.  
- O: Present but not in position 2.  
- A: Present but not in position 4 (cannot be in 1, 2, or 4 → must be 3 or 5).  
- R: Present but not in position 5 (cannot be in 1, 4, or 5 → must be 2 or 3).  

### Key Constraints:
- **Confirmed letters:** A, R, O.  
- **Absent letters:** I, S, E, C, N, P, L.  
- **Position constraints:**  
  - A: Position 3 or 5.  
  - R: Position 2 or 3.  
  - O: Cannot be in 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
- Must exclude forbidden letters (I/S/E/C/N/P/L) and test new common letters (e.g., B, V).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **BRAVO** fits all constraints:  
  - **B**: Position 1 (untested).  
  - **R**: Position 2 (valid per constraints).  
  - **A**: Position 3 (valid per constraints).  
  - **V**: Position 4 (untested).  
  - **O**: Position 5 (valid per constraints).  
- Tests A at position 3 and O at position 5 (critical unknowns).  
- Uses common letters B and V to maximize information.  
- Avoids forbidden letters, adheres to all position rules.  

<guess>BRAVO</guess>",BRAVO,"We have the following feedback from the three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(-), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
Meaning: 
  - R is in the word, but not at position 1.
  - A is in the word, but not at position 2.
  - I, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ACORN -> A(-), C(x), O(-), R(-), N(x)
Meaning:
  - A is in the word, but not at position 1 (so combined with Guess1, A is not at position 1 or 2 -> must be at 3, 4, or 5).
  - C and N are not in the word.
  - O is in the word, but not at position 3.
  - R is in the word, but not at position 4.

Guess 3: POLAR -> P(x), O(-), L(x), A(-), R(-)
Meaning:
  - P and L are not in the word.
  - O is in the word, but not at position 2 (this is new).
  - A is in the word, but not at position 4? Wait: A is at position 4 in this guess? And we get A(-), meaning A is in the word but not at position 4? 
  - R is in the word, but not at position 5? Because R is at position 5 in this guess? And we get R(-), meaning R is in the word but not at position 5? 

So let's update the position constraints:

From Guess1: 
   R not at 1, A not at 2.

From Guess2:
   A not at 1 -> so A must be at 3,4, or 5? But now from Guess3, we have more? 
      In POLAR, A was at position 4 and we got A(-)? So A is not at position 4? 
   Similarly, R not at 4? And from Guess3: R at position 5 -> R(-)? So R not at 5? 
   Also O not at 3? And from Guess3: O was at position 2 -> O(-)? So O is not at position 2? 

Therefore:

A positions: 
   Not at 1 (guess2), not at 2 (guess1), not at 4 (guess3) -> so A must be at position 3 or 5? 

R positions:
   Not at 1 (guess1), not at 4 (guess2), not at 5 (guess3) -> so R must be at position 2 or 3? 

O positions:
   Not at 3 (guess2), not at 2 (guess3) -> so O must be at position 1, 4, or 5? 

Also, we know the word contains A, R, O? Because they are marked as present? 

And the absent letters: I, S, E, C, N, P, L? 

So the word must have A, R, O, and two other letters? 

But we also know that the secret word has 5 letters? And we must avoid I,S,E,C,N,P,L? 

Available letters? 

We have tested:
  Letters in the word (present): A, R, O? 
  Letters not in the word: I, S, E, C, N, P, L.

So common letters left? T, U, D, M, B, G, K, H, Y, W, F, V, Z, etc.? 

Now, we need to form a word with A, R, O and two of the remaining letters? 

And also satisfy the position constraints:

   A must be at 3 or 5.
   R must be at 2 or 3.
   O must be at 1,4,5.

But if A is at 3 and R is at 2? That's okay? Or if A is at 3 and R is at 3? That can't be because one position? 

So:

Case 1: A at position 3? 
   Then R must be at 2 (because not at 3? because occupied by A? One letter per position? 
   Then O must be at 1,4,5? 

   So word: [O?] [R] [A] [?] [?] or [O?] [R] [A] [O?] [?] or [O?] [R] [A] [?] [O?] 

   But O cannot be at 2? And R is at 2? So O not at 2 okay? 

Case 2: A at position 5?
   Then R must be at 2 or 3? 
   O can be at 1,4? (since position 5 is taken by A? So O not at 5? 

   So:
      If R at 2: word: [O?] [R] [?] [O?] [A]? 
      If R at 3: word: [O?] [?] [R] [O?] [A]?

Now, we need to fill in the other positions? 

Also, we have to include only one? O? Or duplicates? But we haven't had duplicate clues? So let's assume no duplicates? 

So let's form words? 

First, case 1: A at 3, R at 2, O at 1,4, or 5? 

But O can be at 1,4,5? 

If O at 1: then word: O, R, A, ?, ??
   The last two not I,S,E,C,N,P,L? And must be two different letters? 

   Example: ORA?? 

   Possible: ORATE? But E is out? 
            ORACY? C is out? 
            ORALE? E? 
            ORAXY? Not common? 
            ORANG? N? 
            ORALS? S? 
            ORANT? N? 
            So no? 

If O at 4: then word: [ ? ] , R, A, O, [ ? ] 

   Positions: 
      Position 1: ? 
      Position 2: R
      Position 3: A
      Position 4: O
      Position 5: ?

   We need a word: ? R A O ? 

   Avoid I,S,E,C,N,P,L? 

   Common words: 
      ""DRAKE"" -> E? 
      ""DRAPE"" -> E, P? 
      ""GRAVE"" -> E? 
      ""BRAKE"" -> E? 
      ""CRAZE"" -> E? 
      ""TRACE"" -> E? 
      ""FRAME"" -> E? 
      ""GRADE"" -> E? 
      ""GRACE"" -> E? 

      Without E: 
        ""BRAVO"" -> B,R,A,V,O -> positions: B1, R2, A3, V4, O5? But we want O at 4? 
          BRAVO: positions: B1, R2, A3, V4, O5? So V4? But we need O at 4? 
          So ""BRAVO"" has O at 5? Not at 4? 

        ""KRAUT"" -> K,R,A,U,T? But U4? Not O? 

        How about ""FRAUD""? F,R,A,U,D -> has U4? 
          We want O at 4? So not? 

        ""CRAWL"" -> C? and L? 
        ""DRAWL"" -> L? 

        So the only one I can think is ""??RAO?"" and then the fifth letter? But we need two letters? 

        The candidate: ? R A O ? 

        We need a valid word? 

        ""PROA?"" not. 

        ""GROAN"" -> has G,R,O,A,N? But positions: G1, R2, O3? But we need O at 4? 

        Actually, no word? 

        What's a word with letters ending with O? 

        ""TORAO""? Not common? 

        ""CURAO""? Has C? 

        ""DRAOO""? Not a word. 

O at 5: then word: [ ? ] , R, A, ? , O

   So pattern: _ R A _ O

   Words: 
      ""DRAXO""? Not common? 
      ""GRAPO""? Has P? 
      ""TRAVO""? T,R,A,V,O? Positions: T1, R2, A3, V4, O5? 
          So ""TRAVO""? Is this a word? It might be Travo? Not common? 
      ""BRAVO""? B1,R2,A3,V4,O5? 
          So ""BRAVO"" fits the pattern? But does it avoid? B,R,A,V,O? V is allowed? 
          And we avoid I,S,E,C,N,P,L? Yes? 

      So ""BRAVO"" is a candidate? 

      But we must have O? And in BRAVO, O is at position 5? Which is okay? 

      But note: O is also in the word? But at position 5? 

      And A is at position 3? 
      R at position 2? 

      And we have B and V? 

      Also, O must be at position 1,4,5? Here we put O at 5? So valid? 

      And R at 2? Valid? 
      A at 3? Valid? 

      So ""BRAVO"" is a candidate? 

Now case 2: A at position 5? 

Then R must be at 2 or 3? 

Subcase 2.1: R at 2? 
   Then O must be at 1 or 4? 
   Word: O? R ? ? A   or   ? R ? O A

   First: O at position 1: O, R, ?, ?, A -> pattern: O R _ _ A
        Words: 
          ""ORLON"" -> L? and N? 
          ""ORMER"" -> E? 
          ""ORVAL"" -> L? 
          ""ORXY?"" -> X,Y? 
          ""OPTMA""? No? 
        Common: ""ORTHA""? Not? 
                ""ORNA""? N? 

   Second: O at position 4: ? , R, ?, O, A
        Pattern: _ R _ O A
        Words: 
          ""ARTZO""? Not? 
          ""ARTOO""? Duplicate? 
          ""BROOD""? Has B? O duplicate? 
          ""CROWD""? C? 
          ""DROID""? I? 
          ""GROUT""? G,R,O,U,T? -> U3? 
          ""FROST""? S? 
          ""WRONG""? W,R,O,N,G? -> N? 
          ""PROOF""? P? 
          ""TROOP""? T,R,O,O,P? -> duplicate O? and P? 
          ""BROAD""? B,R,O,A,D? -> positions: B1,R2,O3? But we want O at 4? So not? 

          How about ""GRUOA""? Not? 

        So hard to find? 

Subcase 2.2: A at 5, R at 3? 
   Then O must be at 1 or 4? 
   Word: O ? R ? A   or   ? ? R O A

   First: O at 1: O, ?, R, ?, A -> pattern: O _ R _ A
        Words: 
          ""OARED"" -> E? 
          ""OATER"" -> E? 
          ""ORDER"" -> E? 
          ""OTHER"" -> T,H? -> O,T,H,E,R? But E? 
          ""OUZEL"" -> U,Z,E? 
          ""OFFER"" -> E? 
          ""OCTAR""? C? 
          ""OMBRA""? M,B? -> O,M,B,R,A? positions: O1,M2,B3,R4,A5? 
            But R must be at position 3? So not? 
          ""OUNCRY""? Not 5? 

   Second: O at 4: ? , ? , R, O, A -> pattern: _ _ R O A
        Words: 
          ""BAROA""? Not? 
          ""CAROA""? C? 
          ""PAROA""? P? 
          ""TAROA""? T1,A2,R3,O4,A5? But A twice? 
          ""VEROA""? E? 
          ""MAROA""? M1,A2,R3,O4,A5? Duplicate A? 
          ""BUT T? 

        Common: ""MIHRA""? Not? 
                ""TERRA"" -> E? and duplicate R? 
                ""FERRO"" -> E? 
                ""SAROS"" -> S? 
                ""HERON"" -> E? and N? 

        So no? 

Therefore, the only candidate we have so far is ""BRAVO"" from case 1? 

But let's confirm:

   BRAVO: 
        B1, R2, A3, V4, O5.

   Constraints:
        A? position 3: valid (A can be in 3? 
        R? position 2: valid (R can be in 2? 
        O? position 5: valid (O can be in 5? 

   And O must be at 1,4,5? Here 5? 

   And absent letters: B and V? We haven't eliminated them? 

   And the word: BRAVO? is it valid? 

   Yes, means a shout? 

   Also, we must check: any other possibilities? 

   Another candidate: 

   In case 1, with O at position 5: we have pattern ? R A ? O? But in ""BRAVO"", we have ? R A V O? That's B R A V O? 

   Are there others? 

   Like G R A Y O? But Y? 

   P R A C O? But C? 

   D R A W O? But W? 

   But we need a valid word? 

   BRAVO is one? 

   Also, what about if O is at position 1? In case 1 with A at 3 and R at 2? 

   We tried and didn't find a common word? 

   Or if O is at 4? 

   Example: O R A O B? But duplicate O? 

   So for now, BRAVO is the candidate? 

But let me double-check: 

   We have another possibility: 

   What if O is at position 4? 

   In case 1: A at 3, R at 2, O at 4: so pattern: ? R A O ? 

   Words: 
        GRAO?? 
        BRAO?? 
        DRAO?? 

   No common? 

   Also, O at 5: BRAVO.

   But note: the secret word could have more letters? 

   Maybe there are duplicates? We haven't ruled out? 

   But in feedback, we haven't had a duplicate? 

   For example, in RAISE: A and R were present once? 

   Similarly, in ACORN: A,O,R? Present? 

   In POLAR: O,A,R? 

   So assume one each? 

   So BRAVO: is a word with distinct letters? 

   But B and V? 

   So we guess BRAVO? 

   But we must also note: from Guess3, we learned that O is not at 2? So in BRAVO, O is at 5? 

   And V is new? 

   Also B? 

   So let's go with BRAVO. 

   But wait: in case 2: A at 5? 

   We didn't find a word? 

   But maybe ""TOROA"" not? 

   Or ""MOROA""? 

   Or ""ARROW""? A,R,R,O,W? Duplicate R? And positions: A1,R2,R3,O4,W5? But R at position 2 and 3? But we need one R? 

   So invalid? 

   Therefore, BRAVO is the best candidate? 

   So <guess>BRAVO</guess> 

   But note: we must check if V is allowed? 

   V is not eliminated? 

   Yes? 

   So I'll go with BRAVO. 

   Alternatively, we can consider ""GROAN"" but has N? 

   Or ""ROBOT"" but O at 3? Not allowed? 

   So BRAVO.### Previous Feedback Analysis:

**Guess 1: RAISE → R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)**  
- R: Present but not in position 1.  
- A: Present but not in position 2.  
- I, S, E: Absent.  

**Guess 2: ACORN → A(-) C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x)**  
- A: Present but not in position 1 (combined with Guess 1, cannot be in 1 or 2 → must be 3, 4, or 5).  
- C, N: Absent.  
- O: Present but not in position 3.  
- R: Present but not in position 4.  

**Guess 3: POLAR → P(x) O(-) L(x) A(-) R(-)**  
- P, L: Absent.  
- O: Present but not in position 2.  
- A: Present but not in position 4 (cannot be in 1, 2, or 4 → must be 3 or 5).  
- R: Present but not in position 5 (cannot be in 1, 4, or 5 → must be 2 or 3).  

### Key Constraints:
- **Confirmed letters:** A, R, O.  
- **Absent letters:** I, S, E, C, N, P, L.  
- **Position constraints:**  
  - A: Position 3 or 5.  
  - R: Position 2 or 3.  
  - O: Cannot be in 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
- Must exclude forbidden letters (I/S/E/C/N/P/L) and test new common letters (e.g., B, V).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **BRAVO** fits all constraints:  
  - **B**: Position 1 (untested).  
  - **R**: Position 2 (valid per constraints).  
  - **A**: Position 3 (valid per constraints).  
  - **V**: Position 4 (untested).  
  - **O**: Position 5 (valid per constraints).  
- Tests A at position 3 and O at position 5 (critical unknowns).  
- Uses common letters B and V to maximize information.  
- Avoids forbidden letters, adheres to all position rules.",Guess 4: BRAVO -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) R(✓) A(✓) V(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
