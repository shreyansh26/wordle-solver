 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

 This means:
 - E is in the secret word and is in the correct position. Since E is the last letter, we know the secret word ends with E.
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word is of the form _ _ _ _ E.

 Since C, R, A, N are absent, we must avoid these letters in our next guess.

 We also know that the word has an E in the fifth position.

 For our next guess, we should try to include other common letters that haven't been tried yet (avoiding C, R, A, N).

 Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, S, T, L, O, I, etc. We already know E is in the word (at the end).

 We can try a word that has new letters and ends with E? But note: the E is already in the correct position, so we don't need to test it again? 
 However, we might get more information by using E again? But the feedback for E will always be correct in the last position until we solve.

 But note: the feedback for the fifth letter is already known to be correct, so we can focus on the first four letters.

 We should choose a word that:
 - Ends with E (to confirm the pattern, but actually we already know that, so we can use that position to test other letters? 
   However, we are required to make a valid 5-letter word, and we know the last letter is E, so we can use that to our advantage by having a word ending in E.

 But also, we want to test new letters. Let's avoid the letters that are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Possible common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, M, P, etc.

 We can form a word that has new letters and ends with E.

 Some examples: 
   ""SLATE"" -> but A is absent (from previous feedback) so we cannot use A.
   ""ROUTE"" -> R is absent.
   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but we don't know about P, O, I, S.

 However, we must avoid A, R, C, N.

 Let's think of words ending in E that use common letters not yet tried.

 Some options:
   ""SPITE"" -> uses S, P, I, T, E -> all new letters.
   ""SLIME"" -> S, L, I, M, E -> but we don't know about S, L, I, M.
   ""SHINE"" -> but H is new, but N is absent -> we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N, so ""SHINE"" is invalid because of N.

 Another: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are new? But wait, we have to avoid A, R, C, N. O is allowed.

 However, we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters.

 Let me list the absent letters: C, R, A, N.

 So we can use any other letters.

 We want to maximize information: so we should try to include as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

 I think ""SLATE"" is not possible because of A (absent). Similarly, ""STARE"" has A and R (both absent).

 Let me try to form a word: 
   We need a 5-letter word ending in E, and the first four letters must not contain C, R, A, N.

 Some words:
   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E
   ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E
   ""GUISE"" -> G, U, I, S, E
   ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E
   ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E

 Among these, which one has the most common letters? 

 Since we are in the second guess, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 The most common consonants: S, T, L, ... and vowels: O, I.

 ""STOLE"" has S, T, O, L -> that's four common letters and then E (which we know). 
 But note: we already know E is in the word and in the correct position, so we are testing S, T, O, L in positions 1,2,3,4.

 Alternatively, ""SPITE"" has S, P, I, T -> P and I are also common.

 But let's look at frequency in English: 
   S, T, L, O, I, P, etc.

 I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate because it has S, T, O, L.

 However, we must consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn't show any duplicates so far, and we don't have any information.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" had all the other letters absent, so it's unlikely that the word has duplicates of E? But we don't know.

 We'll go with ""STOLE"".

 But wait: what if the word has an O? We don't know. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't have the E at the end? Actually, we know the last letter must be E, so we can use that to our advantage by having a word that ends in E to get more information about the other positions.

 However, we are allowed to use any valid word. But if we don't put E at the end, then we would be wasting the known correct position? 

 But the rules: we must guess a 5-letter word. We know the last letter is E, so it would be wise to use that to test the first four.

 Therefore, I will choose a word that ends with E and uses new letters.

 Let me choose ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E.

 So the guess is ""STOLE"".

 But note: we are not forced to use the known E at the end. We could use a word that has E in a different position to see if there is another E? 
 However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one E (at the end) and the other letters were absent. So if there was another E, then the feedback for the first E (in ""crane"") would have been a '-' if it was present but in the wrong position? 

 In ""crane"", the E was at the end and correct. The other E? There was only one E in ""crane"". 

 But the secret word might have two E's? For example, ""BELLE"" has two E's. However, in our feedback for ""crane"", we only got one E marked as correct. The other E in the secret word would have been in a position we didn't guess? 

 However, in ""crane"", we only tested one E. So if the secret word has two E's, then the other E would not have been revealed because we didn't guess it in that position.

 So it's possible that there is another E. But we don't know.

 To test for the presence of another E, we could put an E in a different position. However, we are only on the second guess, and we have limited information.

 Alternatively, we can focus on the structure: the word ends with E, and the first four letters are unknown (without C, R, A, N).

 I think it's more efficient to use the known E at the end and test new letters in the first four.

 Therefore, I will go with ""STOLE"".

 But let me check: is ""STOLE"" a valid word? Yes.

 So, next guess: ""STOLE""

<guess>stole</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is correct and in the right position (5th letter), so the secret word ends with **E**.
- **C, R, A, N** are absent and cannot be reused.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E** to leverage the known correct position.
- New letters should be tested in positions 1–4, avoiding **C, R, A, N**.
- Common letters like **S, T, O, L** are prioritized to maximize information.

The word **""STOLE""** fits these criteria:
- Ends with **E** (confirmed position).
- Tests **S, T, O, L** (all new, high-frequency letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (**C, R, A, N**).

 However, we are allowed to use any valid word. But if we don't put E at the end, then we would be wasting the known correct position? 

 But the rules: we must guess a 5-letter word. We know the last letter is E, so it would be wise to use that to test the first four.

 Therefore, I will choose a word that ends with E and uses new letters.

 Let me choose ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E.

 So the guess is ""STOLE"".

 But note: we are not forced to use the known E at the end. We could use a word that has E in a different position to see if there is another E? 
 However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one E (at the end) and the other letters were absent. So if there was another E, then the feedback for the first E (in ""crane"") would have been a '-' if it was present but in the wrong position? 

 In ""crane"", the E was at the end and correct. The other E? There was only one E in ""crane"". 

 But the secret word might have two E's? For example, ""BELLE"" has two E's. However, in our feedback for ""crane"", we only got one E marked as correct. The other E in the secret word would have been in a position we didn't guess? 

 However, in ""crane"", we only tested one E. So if the secret word has two E's, then the other E would not have been revealed because we didn't guess it in that position.

 So it's possible that there is another E. But we don't know.

 To test for the presence of another E, we could put an E in a different position. However, we are only on the second guess, and we have limited information.

 Alternatively, we can focus on the structure: the word ends with E, and the first four letters are unknown (without C, R, A, N).

 I think it's more efficient to use the known E at the end and test new letters in the first four.

 Therefore, I will go with ""STOLE"".

 But let me check: is ""STOLE"" a valid word? Yes.

 So, next guess: ""STOLE""

<guess>stole</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is correct and in the right position (5th letter), so the secret word ends with **E**.
- **C, R, A, N** are absent and cannot be reused.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E** to leverage the known correct position.
- New letters should be tested in positions 1–4, avoiding **C, R, A, N**.
- Common letters like **S, T, O, L** are prioritized to maximize information.

The word **""STOLE""** fits these criteria:
- Ends with **E** (confirmed position).
- Tests **S, T, O, L** (all new, high-frequency letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (**C, R, A, N**).

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
  - The letter E is in the secret word and is in the correct position (position 5).
  - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""stole"" -> S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
  - The letter E is again confirmed in position 5 (which we already knew).
  - The letters S, T, O, L are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has the following constraints:
1. It ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. It does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.

We have used 8 distinct letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.

The secret word is of the form [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E.

We must choose a new guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter word.
- Ends with E (to maintain the known correct position for E, though we could choose not to, but it helps narrow down).
- Avoids the 8 known absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.
- Introduces new letters to gain information.

We need to consider what letters are left. Common letters in English that haven't been tried:
Vowels: U, I (and sometimes Y)
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We should aim for a word that uses common remaining letters and ends with E.

Examples of common words ending in E:
- ""BIKE"" -> but K and E? But we need 5 letters? Wait, ""BIKE"" is 4 letters? Let me think of 5-letter words.

Potential words:
- ""PIQUE"": uses P, I, Q, U, E -> but Q and U are less common? And Q might be risky.
- ""JUICE"": uses J, U, I, C, E -> but C is already known absent? (from guess1) -> we cannot use C.
- ""DUNCE"": uses D, U, N, C, E -> but N and C are absent, so invalid.
- ""GUIDE"": uses G, U, I, D, E -> all new letters? G, U, I, D are not in the absent list.
- ""MIXED"": uses M, I, X, E, D -> ends with E? No, it ends with D. We need to end with E.
- ""DIMES"": ends with S -> but S is absent? Cannot use S.

We need words ending with E and avoiding the absent letters.

List some words:
- ""GUIDE"": G, U, I, D, E -> checks: G, U, I, D are not in {C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L}. So valid.
- ""QUIET"": ends with T? Not E.
- ""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> but the first letter is B and last is E. But note: we have two E's? And the word is [B][E][I][G][E]? Actually, ""beige"" is 5 letters: B-E-I-G-E. But position 5 is E? Yes. But what about the E in position 2? We don't know if there's another E. Also, avoiding absent: B, E, I, G -> E is already known to be present, but we can reuse E? However, we know E is in position 5, but the word might have E somewhere else? And we can test that.

But note: the absent letters we have are C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L. So B, I, G are allowed? Wait, ""beige"" uses E twice? We can use repeated letters? Yes, but we must account for the possibility.

But ""beige"" might be a good candidate? However, we are trying to introduce new letters. We already know E is present at the end, so the E in position 2 is additional.

However, we are allowed to guess words with repeated E? But let's see if we can form words with only new letters.

Alternatively, consider ""BUMPY""? Doesn't end with E.

Another candidate: ""GIVEN"": but ends with N? Wait, and N is absent? So invalid.

Possible words:
- ""PRIDE"": but R is absent (from guess1) -> invalid.
- ""BIKIE"": not standard? Or ""BIKE"" expanded? Not common.

More common words:
- ""PIECE"": P, I, E, C, E -> but C is absent? Invalid.
- ""QUEUE"": Q, U, E, U, E -> but we don't know about Q and U? And it has two U's. But the word ends with E? Yes. But Q and U are new? And we haven't tried them. Also, the absent letters? A, C, R, N, S, T, O, L are not including Q or U.
  However, ""queue"" is a valid English word? Yes.

But ""QUEUE"" might be uncommon? Also, it only introduces Q and U? Because E we know.

Perhaps ""GUIDE"" is better because it uses more common letters: G, U, I, D.

Another: ""PHASE"" -> but S and A are absent? Invalid.

""WHILE"" -> L and E? But L is absent? From guess2: L is absent -> invalid.

""MOVIE"" -> ends with E? Actually, ""movie"" is M-O-V-I-E -> 5 letters? Yes. But we cannot use O (absent) and M, V, I are new? So M, V, I, E. But O is absent? So invalid because O is absent.

""ABIDE"" -> A is absent? Invalid.

So after some thought, let's try ""GUIDE"" as a candidate.

But wait, ""GUIDE"": G-U-I-D-E. The E is in the end, correct. We test G at position1, U at2, I at3, D at4.

If the secret word has G, U, I, or D, we will get feedback.

Alternatively, consider ""BEIGE"": B-E-I-G-E -> tests B at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, E at5. Since E is already known to be at5, we are testing for another E at position2? But we know from guess1 that there is only one E? Actually, guess1 only showed one E (at the end). But if there is an E in position2, then in guess1 we didn't have E in position2, so we wouldn't have known.

However, the feedback for ""crane"" didn't show any other E as being present but wrong position? Because if there was an E elsewhere, it would have been marked with '-'? But in ""crane"", we only had one E (at the end) and no other E in the guess? Actually, we guessed only one E.

So it's possible that there is an E in position2? The absence of evidence in the first guess doesn't prove there isn't another E.

But we are on the second guess? Wait, we've only made two guesses.

But ""stole"" also didn't have any E at position2? Wait, we had E at the end only.

So we haven't tested E in any other position.

Therefore, if we guess a word with E in position2, we might get a '-' if it is present but we don't know.

However, to maximize letter coverage, we should try a word without E except at the end? Because we are limited to 5-letter words.

Given that we have 6 guesses, we can sacrifice a position to test the E duplication? But on the third guess, we can focus on letters.

I think ""BEIGE"" is a good candidate? But it uses E twice? And the E in position2 is a test for duplication.

But note: we are allowed to reuse letters? The rules don't forbid it.

Alternatively, let's look for a word that doesn't have E in any other position, so we test only new letters.

For example: ""PUDGE"" -> P-U-D-G-E -> all new letters except E at the end? That's good.

Is ""PUDGE"" a word? It's slang? Or ""FUDGE""? F-U-D-G-E -> yes, ""fudge"" is a valid word.

""FUDGE"": F-U-D-G-E -> uses F, U, D, G, E. 
- F is new, not in absent list? Absent: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L -> F is not in there.
- U, D, G are also new.

So ""FUDGE"" would be a safe guess: we test F, U, D, G, and E (known).

Similarly, ""DODGE""? But O and D? O is absent? So invalid.

""WEDGE"": W-E-D-G-E -> but E is in position2? Again, testing for an extra E? And we test W, D, G.

But ""fudge"" avoids any extra E.

So I think ""FUDGE"" is a better candidate than ""GUIDE"" because it uses common letters? F, U, D, G are all common enough.

Another word: ""MIDGE"" -> M-I-D-G-E -> M, I, D, G, E -> also valid.

But ""fudge"" versus ""midge""? Both are valid.

We choose one. Let's go with ""FUDGE"".

But we must confirm: all letters in ""FUDGE"" are not in the absent list: F, U, D, G are not in {C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L}.

Yes.

Therefore, our next guess is ""FUDGE"".

But wait, we haven't tested the letter B? Or P? There are many letters left.

We have to make a choice.

Alternatively, ""PURGE""? But U, R? But R is absent? So invalid.

""INODE""? Not a word.

""QUAKE""? But A is absent? Invalid.

""JUICE""? J-U-I-C-E -> C is absent? Invalid.

So ""FUDGE"" seems good.

Also, words like ""BADGE"" are invalid because A is absent.

Therefore, I choose ""FUDGE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter). C, R, A, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""stole""):** E is confirmed in position 5. S, T, O, L are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word ends with **E**.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L (8 total).
- The word must be of the form `[?][?][?][?]E`, avoiding the absent letters.
- Remaining common letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Focus on introducing new high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested.
- Avoid reusing absent letters and reuse E only in position 5.
- Prioritize words that maximize coverage of new letters (e.g., F, U, D, G, H, M).
- ""FUDGE"" is a strong candidate: 
  - Uses new letters: F, U, D, G (all untested).
  - Ends with E (maintains known position).
  - Tests 4 new letters in positions 1–4.

Alternatively, consider ""BEIGE"": B-E-I-G-E -> tests B at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, E at5. Since E is already known to be at5, we are testing for another E at position2? But we know from guess1 that there is only one E? Actually, guess1 only showed one E (at the end). But if there is an E in position2, then in guess1 we didn't have E in position2, so we wouldn't have known.

However, the feedback for ""crane"" didn't show any other E as being present but wrong position? Because if there was an E elsewhere, it would have been marked with '-'? But in ""crane"", we only had one E (at the end) and no other E in the guess? Actually, we guessed only one E.

So it's possible that there is an E in position2? The absence of evidence in the first guess doesn't prove there isn't another E.

But we are on the second guess? Wait, we've only made two guesses.

But ""stole"" also didn't have any E at position2? Wait, we had E at the end only.

So we haven't tested E in any other position.

Therefore, if we guess a word with E in position2, we might get a '-' if it is present but we don't know.

However, to maximize letter coverage, we should try a word without E except at the end? Because we are limited to 5-letter words.

Given that we have 6 guesses, we can sacrifice a position to test the E duplication? But on the third guess, we can focus on letters.

I think ""BEIGE"" is a good candidate? But it uses E twice? And the E in position2 is a test for duplication.

But note: we are allowed to reuse letters? The rules don't forbid it.

Alternatively, let's look for a word that doesn't have E in any other position, so we test only new letters.

For example: ""PUDGE"" -> P-U-D-G-E -> all new letters except E at the end? That's good.

Is ""PUDGE"" a word? It's slang? Or ""FUDGE""? F-U-D-G-E -> yes, ""fudge"" is a valid word.

""FUDGE"": F-U-D-G-E -> uses F, U, D, G, E. 
- F is new, not in absent list? Absent: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L -> F is not in there.
- U, D, G are also new.

So ""FUDGE"" would be a safe guess: we test F, U, D, G, and E (known).

Similarly, ""DODGE""? But O and D? O is absent? So invalid.

""WEDGE"": W-E-D-G-E -> but E is in position2? Again, testing for an extra E? And we test W, D, G.

But ""fudge"" avoids any extra E.

So I think ""FUDGE"" is a better candidate than ""GUIDE"" because it uses common letters? F, U, D, G are all common enough.

Another word: ""MIDGE"" -> M-I-D-G-E -> M, I, D, G, E -> also valid.

But ""fudge"" versus ""midge""? Both are valid.

We choose one. Let's go with ""FUDGE"".

But we must confirm: all letters in ""FUDGE"" are not in the absent list: F, U, D, G are not in {C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L}.

Yes.

Therefore, our next guess is ""FUDGE"".

But wait, we haven't tested the letter B? Or P? There are many letters left.

We have to make a choice.

Alternatively, ""PURGE""? But U, R? But R is absent? So invalid.

""INODE""? Not a word.

""QUAKE""? But A is absent? Invalid.

""JUICE""? J-U-I-C-E -> C is absent? Invalid.

So ""FUDGE"" seems good.

Also, words like ""BADGE"" are invalid because A is absent.

Therefore, I choose ""FUDGE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter). C, R, A, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""stole""):** E is confirmed in position 5. S, T, O, L are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word ends with **E**.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L (8 total).
- The word must be of the form `[?][?][?][?]E`, avoiding the absent letters.
- Remaining common letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Focus on introducing new high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested.
- Avoid reusing absent letters and reuse E only in position 5.
- Prioritize words that maximize coverage of new letters (e.g., F, U, D, G, H, M).
- ""FUDGE"" is a strong candidate: 
  - Uses new letters: F, U, D, G (all untested).
  - Ends with E (maintains known position).
  - Tests 4 new letters in positions 1–4.",Guess 3: fudge -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(-) D(x) G(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,IMBUE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

 This means:
 - E is in the secret word and is in the correct position. Since E is the last letter, we know the secret word ends with E.
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word is of the form _ _ _ _ E.

 Since C, R, A, N are absent, we must avoid these letters in our next guess.

 We also know that the word has an E in the fifth position.

 For our next guess, we should try to include other common letters that haven't been tried yet (avoiding C, R, A, N).

 Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, S, T, L, O, I, etc. We already know E is in the word (at the end).

 We can try a word that has new letters and ends with E? But note: the E is already in the correct position, so we don't need to test it again? 
 However, we might get more information by using E again? But the feedback for E will always be correct in the last position until we solve.

 But note: the feedback for the fifth letter is already known to be correct, so we can focus on the first four letters.

 We should choose a word that:
 - Ends with E (to confirm the pattern, but actually we already know that, so we can use that position to test other letters? 
   However, we are required to make a valid 5-letter word, and we know the last letter is E, so we can use that to our advantage by having a word ending in E.

 But also, we want to test new letters. Let's avoid the letters that are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Possible common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, M, P, etc.

 We can form a word that has new letters and ends with E.

 Some examples: 
   ""SLATE"" -> but A is absent (from previous feedback) so we cannot use A.
   ""ROUTE"" -> R is absent.
   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but we don't know about P, O, I, S.

 However, we must avoid A, R, C, N.

 Let's think of words ending in E that use common letters not yet tried.

 Some options:
   ""SPITE"" -> uses S, P, I, T, E -> all new letters.
   ""SLIME"" -> S, L, I, M, E -> but we don't know about S, L, I, M.
   ""SHINE"" -> but H is new, but N is absent -> we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N, so ""SHINE"" is invalid because of N.

 Another: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are new? But wait, we have to avoid A, R, C, N. O is allowed.

 However, we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters.

 Let me list the absent letters: C, R, A, N.

 So we can use any other letters.

 We want to maximize information: so we should try to include as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

 I think ""SLATE"" is not possible because of A (absent). Similarly, ""STARE"" has A and R (both absent).

 Let me try to form a word: 
   We need a 5-letter word ending in E, and the first four letters must not contain C, R, A, N.

 Some words:
   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E
   ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E
   ""GUISE"" -> G, U, I, S, E
   ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E
   ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E

 Among these, which one has the most common letters? 

 Since we are in the second guess, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 The most common consonants: S, T, L, ... and vowels: O, I.

 ""STOLE"" has S, T, O, L -> that's four common letters and then E (which we know). 
 But note: we already know E is in the word and in the correct position, so we are testing S, T, O, L in positions 1,2,3,4.

 Alternatively, ""SPITE"" has S, P, I, T -> P and I are also common.

 But let's look at frequency in English: 
   S, T, L, O, I, P, etc.

 I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate because it has S, T, O, L.

 However, we must consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn't show any duplicates so far, and we don't have any information.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" had all the other letters absent, so it's unlikely that the word has duplicates of E? But we don't know.

 We'll go with ""STOLE"".

 But wait: what if the word has an O? We don't know. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't have the E at the end? Actually, we know the last letter must be E, so we can use that to our advantage by having a word that ends in E to get more information about the other positions.

 However, we are allowed to use any valid word. But if we don't put E at the end, then we would be wasting the known correct position? 

 But the rules: we must guess a 5-letter word. We know the last letter is E, so it would be wise to use that to test the first four.

 Therefore, I will choose a word that ends with E and uses new letters.

 Let me choose ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E.

 So the guess is ""STOLE"".

 But note: we are not forced to use the known E at the end. We could use a word that has E in a different position to see if there is another E? 
 However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one E (at the end) and the other letters were absent. So if there was another E, then the feedback for the first E (in ""crane"") would have been a '-' if it was present but in the wrong position? 

 In ""crane"", the E was at the end and correct. The other E? There was only one E in ""crane"". 

 But the secret word might have two E's? For example, ""BELLE"" has two E's. However, in our feedback for ""crane"", we only got one E marked as correct. The other E in the secret word would have been in a position we didn't guess? 

 However, in ""crane"", we only tested one E. So if the secret word has two E's, then the other E would not have been revealed because we didn't guess it in that position.

 So it's possible that there is another E. But we don't know.

 To test for the presence of another E, we could put an E in a different position. However, we are only on the second guess, and we have limited information.

 Alternatively, we can focus on the structure: the word ends with E, and the first four letters are unknown (without C, R, A, N).

 I think it's more efficient to use the known E at the end and test new letters in the first four.

 Therefore, I will go with ""STOLE"".

 But let me check: is ""STOLE"" a valid word? Yes.

 So, next guess: ""STOLE""

<guess>stole</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is correct and in the right position (5th letter), so the secret word ends with **E**.
- **C, R, A, N** are absent and cannot be reused.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E** to leverage the known correct position.
- New letters should be tested in positions 1–4, avoiding **C, R, A, N**.
- Common letters like **S, T, O, L** are prioritized to maximize information.

The word **""STOLE""** fits these criteria:
- Ends with **E** (confirmed position).
- Tests **S, T, O, L** (all new, high-frequency letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (**C, R, A, N**).

<guess>stole</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
  - The letter E is in the secret word and is in the correct position (position 5).
  - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""stole"" -> S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
  - The letter E is again confirmed in position 5 (which we already knew).
  - The letters S, T, O, L are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has the following constraints:
1. It ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. It does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.

We have used 8 distinct letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.

The secret word is of the form [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E.

We must choose a new guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter word.
- Ends with E (to maintain the known correct position for E, though we could choose not to, but it helps narrow down).
- Avoids the 8 known absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.
- Introduces new letters to gain information.

We need to consider what letters are left. Common letters in English that haven't been tried:
Vowels: U, I (and sometimes Y)
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We should aim for a word that uses common remaining letters and ends with E.

Examples of common words ending in E:
- ""BIKE"" -> but K and E? But we need 5 letters? Wait, ""BIKE"" is 4 letters? Let me think of 5-letter words.

Potential words:
- ""PIQUE"": uses P, I, Q, U, E -> but Q and U are less common? And Q might be risky.
- ""JUICE"": uses J, U, I, C, E -> but C is already known absent? (from guess1) -> we cannot use C.
- ""DUNCE"": uses D, U, N, C, E -> but N and C are absent, so invalid.
- ""GUIDE"": uses G, U, I, D, E -> all new letters? G, U, I, D are not in the absent list.
- ""MIXED"": uses M, I, X, E, D -> ends with E? No, it ends with D. We need to end with E.
- ""DIMES"": ends with S -> but S is absent? Cannot use S.

We need words ending with E and avoiding the absent letters.

List some words:
- ""GUIDE"": G, U, I, D, E -> checks: G, U, I, D are not in {C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L}. So valid.
- ""QUIET"": ends with T? Not E.
- ""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> but the first letter is B and last is E. But note: we have two E's? And the word is [B][E][I][G][E]? Actually, ""beige"" is 5 letters: B-E-I-G-E. But position 5 is E? Yes. But what about the E in position 2? We don't know if there's another E. Also, avoiding absent: B, E, I, G -> E is already known to be present, but we can reuse E? However, we know E is in position 5, but the word might have E somewhere else? And we can test that.

But note: the absent letters we have are C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L. So B, I, G are allowed? Wait, ""beige"" uses E twice? We can use repeated letters? Yes, but we must account for the possibility.

But ""beige"" might be a good candidate? However, we are trying to introduce new letters. We already know E is present at the end, so the E in position 2 is additional.

However, we are allowed to guess words with repeated E? But let's see if we can form words with only new letters.

Alternatively, consider ""BUMPY""? Doesn't end with E.

Another candidate: ""GIVEN"": but ends with N? Wait, and N is absent? So invalid.

Possible words:
- ""PRIDE"": but R is absent (from guess1) -> invalid.
- ""BIKIE"": not standard? Or ""BIKE"" expanded? Not common.

More common words:
- ""PIECE"": P, I, E, C, E -> but C is absent? Invalid.
- ""QUEUE"": Q, U, E, U, E -> but we don't know about Q and U? And it has two U's. But the word ends with E? Yes. But Q and U are new? And we haven't tried them. Also, the absent letters? A, C, R, N, S, T, O, L are not including Q or U.
  However, ""queue"" is a valid English word? Yes.

But ""QUEUE"" might be uncommon? Also, it only introduces Q and U? Because E we know.

Perhaps ""GUIDE"" is better because it uses more common letters: G, U, I, D.

Another: ""PHASE"" -> but S and A are absent? Invalid.

""WHILE"" -> L and E? But L is absent? From guess2: L is absent -> invalid.

""MOVIE"" -> ends with E? Actually, ""movie"" is M-O-V-I-E -> 5 letters? Yes. But we cannot use O (absent) and M, V, I are new? So M, V, I, E. But O is absent? So invalid because O is absent.

""ABIDE"" -> A is absent? Invalid.

So after some thought, let's try ""GUIDE"" as a candidate.

But wait, ""GUIDE"": G-U-I-D-E. The E is in the end, correct. We test G at position1, U at2, I at3, D at4.

If the secret word has G, U, I, or D, we will get feedback.

Alternatively, consider ""BEIGE"": B-E-I-G-E -> tests B at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, E at5. Since E is already known to be at5, we are testing for another E at position2? But we know from guess1 that there is only one E? Actually, guess1 only showed one E (at the end). But if there is an E in position2, then in guess1 we didn't have E in position2, so we wouldn't have known.

However, the feedback for ""crane"" didn't show any other E as being present but wrong position? Because if there was an E elsewhere, it would have been marked with '-'? But in ""crane"", we only had one E (at the end) and no other E in the guess? Actually, we guessed only one E.

So it's possible that there is an E in position2? The absence of evidence in the first guess doesn't prove there isn't another E.

But we are on the second guess? Wait, we've only made two guesses.

But ""stole"" also didn't have any E at position2? Wait, we had E at the end only.

So we haven't tested E in any other position.

Therefore, if we guess a word with E in position2, we might get a '-' if it is present but we don't know.

However, to maximize letter coverage, we should try a word without E except at the end? Because we are limited to 5-letter words.

Given that we have 6 guesses, we can sacrifice a position to test the E duplication? But on the third guess, we can focus on letters.

I think ""BEIGE"" is a good candidate? But it uses E twice? And the E in position2 is a test for duplication.

But note: we are allowed to reuse letters? The rules don't forbid it.

Alternatively, let's look for a word that doesn't have E in any other position, so we test only new letters.

For example: ""PUDGE"" -> P-U-D-G-E -> all new letters except E at the end? That's good.

Is ""PUDGE"" a word? It's slang? Or ""FUDGE""? F-U-D-G-E -> yes, ""fudge"" is a valid word.

""FUDGE"": F-U-D-G-E -> uses F, U, D, G, E. 
- F is new, not in absent list? Absent: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L -> F is not in there.
- U, D, G are also new.

So ""FUDGE"" would be a safe guess: we test F, U, D, G, and E (known).

Similarly, ""DODGE""? But O and D? O is absent? So invalid.

""WEDGE"": W-E-D-G-E -> but E is in position2? Again, testing for an extra E? And we test W, D, G.

But ""fudge"" avoids any extra E.

So I think ""FUDGE"" is a better candidate than ""GUIDE"" because it uses common letters? F, U, D, G are all common enough.

Another word: ""MIDGE"" -> M-I-D-G-E -> M, I, D, G, E -> also valid.

But ""fudge"" versus ""midge""? Both are valid.

We choose one. Let's go with ""FUDGE"".

But we must confirm: all letters in ""FUDGE"" are not in the absent list: F, U, D, G are not in {C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L}.

Yes.

Therefore, our next guess is ""FUDGE"".

But wait, we haven't tested the letter B? Or P? There are many letters left.

We have to make a choice.

Alternatively, ""PURGE""? But U, R? But R is absent? So invalid.

""INODE""? Not a word.

""QUAKE""? But A is absent? Invalid.

""JUICE""? J-U-I-C-E -> C is absent? Invalid.

So ""FUDGE"" seems good.

Also, words like ""BADGE"" are invalid because A is absent.

Therefore, I choose ""FUDGE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter). C, R, A, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""stole""):** E is confirmed in position 5. S, T, O, L are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word ends with **E**.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L (8 total).
- The word must be of the form `[?][?][?][?]E`, avoiding the absent letters.
- Remaining common letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Focus on introducing new high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested.
- Avoid reusing absent letters and reuse E only in position 5.
- Prioritize words that maximize coverage of new letters (e.g., F, U, D, G, H, M).
- ""FUDGE"" is a strong candidate: 
  - Uses new letters: F, U, D, G (all untested).
  - Ends with E (maintains known position).
  - Tests 4 new letters in positions 1–4.

Let\'s avoid the letters that are absent: C, R, A, N.\n\n Possible common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, M, P, etc.\n\n We can form a word that has new letters and ends with E.\n\n Some examples: \n   ""SLATE"" -> but A is absent (from previous feedback) so we cannot use A.\n   ""ROUTE"" -> R is absent.\n   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but we don\'t know about P, O, I, S.\n\n However, we must avoid A, R, C, N.\n\n Let\'s think of words ending in E that use common letters not yet tried.\n\n Some options:\n   ""SPITE"" -> uses S, P, I, T, E -> all new letters.\n   ""SLIME"" -> S, L, I, M, E -> but we don\'t know about S, L, I, M.\n   ""SHINE"" -> but H is new, but N is absent -> we cannot use N.\n\n We must avoid N, so ""SHINE"" is invalid because of N.\n\n Another: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are new? But wait, we have to avoid A, R, C, N. O is allowed.\n\n However, we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the absent letters.\n\n Let me list the absent letters: C, R, A, N.\n\n So we can use any other letters.\n\n We want to maximize information: so we should try to include as many new common letters as possible.\n\n Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\n I think ""SLATE"" is not possible because of A (absent). Similarly, ""STARE"" has A and R (both absent).\n\n Let me try to form a word: \n   We need a 5-letter word ending in E, and the first four letters must not contain C, R, A, N.\n\n Some words:\n   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E\n   ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E\n   ""GUISE"" -> G, U, I, S, E\n   ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E\n   ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E\n\n Among these, which one has the most common letters? \n\n Since we are in the second guess, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n The most common consonants: S, T, L, ... and vowels: O, I.\n\n ""STOLE"" has S, T, O, L -> that\'s four common letters and then E (which we know). \n But note: we already know E is in the word and in the correct position, so we are testing S, T, O, L in positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPITE"" has S, P, I, T -> P and I are also common.\n\n But let\'s look at frequency in English: \n   S, T, L, O, I, P, etc.\n\n I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate because it has S, T, O, L.\n\n However, we must consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn\'t show any duplicates so far, and we don\'t have any information.\n\n But note: the feedback for ""crane"" had all the other letters absent, so it\'s unlikely that the word has duplicates of E? But we don\'t know.\n\n We\'ll go with ""STOLE"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has an O? We don\'t know. We are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t have the E at the end? Actually, we know the last letter must be E, so we can use that to our advantage by having a word that ends in E to get more information about the other positions.\n\n However, we are allowed to use any valid word. But if we don\'t put E at the end, then we would be wasting the known correct position? \n\n But the rules: we must guess a 5-letter word. We know the last letter is E, so it would be wise to use that to test the first four.\n\n Therefore, I will choose a word that ends with E and uses new letters.\n\n Let me choose ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E.\n\n So the guess is ""STOLE"".\n\n But note: we are not forced to use the known E at the end. We could use a word that has E in a different position to see if there is another E? \n However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one E (at the end) and the other letters were absent. So if there was another E, then the feedback for the first E (in ""crane"") would have been a \'-\' if it was present but in the wrong position? \n\n In ""crane"", the E was at the end and correct. The other E? There was only one E in ""crane"". \n\n But the secret word might have two E\'s? For example, ""BELLE"" has two E\'s. However, in our feedback for ""crane"", we only got one E marked as correct. The other E in the secret word would have been in a position we didn\'t guess? \n\n However, in ""crane"", we only tested one E. So if the secret word has two E\'s, then the other E would not have been revealed because we didn\'t guess it in that position.\n\n So it\'s possible that there is another E. But we don\'t know.\n\n To test for the presence of another E, we could put an E in a different position. However, we are only on the second guess, and we have limited information.\n\n Alternatively, we can focus on the structure: the word ends with E, and the first four letters are unknown (without C, R, A, N).\n\n I think it\'s more efficient to use the known E at the end and test new letters in the first four.\n\n Therefore, I will go with ""STOLE"".\n\n But let me check: is ""STOLE"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n So, next guess: ""STOLE""\n\n<guess>stole</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **E** is correct and in the right position (5th letter), so the secret word ends with **E**.\n- **C, R, A, N** are absent and cannot be reused.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with **E** to leverage the known correct position.\n- New letters should be tested in positions 1–4, avoiding **C, R, A, N**.\n- Common letters like **S, T, O, L** are prioritized to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""STOLE""** fits these criteria:\n- Ends with **E** (confirmed position).\n- Tests **S, T, O, L** (all new, high-frequency letters).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (**C, R, A, N**).\n\n<guess>stole</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nThis tells us:\n  - The letter E is in the secret word and is in the correct position (position 5).\n  - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\nGuess 2: ""stole"" -> S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)\nThis tells us:\n  - The letter E is again confirmed in position 5 (which we already knew).\n  - The letters S, T, O, L are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the following constraints:\n1. It ends with E (position 5 is E).\n2. It does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.\n\nWe have used 8 distinct letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.\n\nThe secret word is of the form [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E.\n\nWe must choose a new guess that:\n- Is a valid 5-letter word.\n- Ends with E (to maintain the known correct position for E, though we could choose not to, but it helps narrow down).\n- Avoids the 8 known absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.\n- Introduces new letters to gain information.\n\nWe need to consider what letters are left. Common letters in English that haven\'t been tried:\nVowels: U, I (and sometimes Y)\nConsonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe should aim for a word that uses common remaining letters and ends with E.\n\nExamples of common words ending in E:\n- ""BIKE"" -> but K and E? But we need 5 letters? Wait, ""BIKE"" is 4 letters? Let me think of 5-letter words.\n\nPotential words:\n- ""PIQUE"": uses P, I, Q, U, E -> but Q and U are less common? And Q might be risky.\n- ""JUICE"": uses J, U, I, C, E -> but C is already known absent? (from guess1) -> we cannot use C.\n- ""DUNCE"": uses D, U, N, C, E -> but N and C are absent, so invalid.\n- ""GUIDE"": uses G, U, I, D, E -> all new letters? G, U, I, D are not in the absent list.\n- ""MIXED"": uses M, I, X, E, D -> ends with E? No, it ends with D. We need to end with E.\n- ""DIMES"": ends with S -> but S is absent? Cannot use S.\n\nWe need words ending with E and avoiding the absent letters.\n\nList some words:\n- ""GUIDE"": G, U, I, D, E -> checks: G, U, I, D are not in {C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L}. So valid.\n- ""QUIET"": ends with T? Not E.\n- ""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> but the first letter is B and last is E. But note: we have two E\'s? And the word is [B][E][I][G][E]? Actually, ""beige"" is 5 letters: B-E-I-G-E. But position 5 is E? Yes. But what about the E in position 2? We don\'t know if there\'s another E. Also, avoiding absent: B, E, I, G -> E is already known to be present, but we can reuse E? However, we know E is in position 5, but the word might have E somewhere else? And we can test that.\n\nBut note: the absent letters we have are C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L. So B, I, G are allowed? Wait, ""beige"" uses E twice? We can use repeated letters? Yes, but we must account for the possibility.\n\nBut ""beige"" might be a good candidate? However, we are trying to introduce new letters. We already know E is present at the end, so the E in position 2 is additional.\n\nHowever, we are allowed to guess words with repeated E? But let\'s see if we can form words with only new letters.\n\nAlternatively, consider ""BUMPY""? Doesn\'t end with E.\n\nAnother candidate: ""GIVEN"": but ends with N? Wait, and N is absent? So invalid.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""PRIDE"": but R is absent (from guess1) -> invalid.\n- ""BIKIE"": not standard? Or ""BIKE"" expanded? Not common.\n\nMore common words:\n- ""PIECE"": P, I, E, C, E -> but C is absent? Invalid.\n- ""QUEUE"": Q, U, E, U, E -> but we don\'t know about Q and U? And it has two U\'s. But the word ends with E? Yes. But Q and U are new? And we haven\'t tried them. Also, the absent letters? A, C, R, N, S, T, O, L are not including Q or U.\n  However, ""queue"" is a valid English word? Yes.\n\nBut ""QUEUE"" might be uncommon? Also, it only introduces Q and U? Because E we know.\n\nPerhaps ""GUIDE"" is better because it uses more common letters: G, U, I, D.\n\nAnother: ""PHASE"" -> but S and A are absent? Invalid.\n\n""WHILE"" -> L and E? But L is absent? From guess2: L is absent -> invalid.\n\n""MOVIE"" -> ends with E? Actually, ""movie"" is M-O-V-I-E -> 5 letters? Yes. But we cannot use O (absent) and M, V, I are new? So M, V, I, E. But O is absent? So invalid because O is absent.\n\n""ABIDE"" -> A is absent? Invalid.\n\nSo after some thought, let\'s try ""GUIDE"" as a candidate.\n\nBut wait, ""GUIDE"": G-U-I-D-E. The E is in the end, correct. We test G at position1, U at2, I at3, D at4.\n\nIf the secret word has G, U, I, or D, we will get feedback.\n\nAlternatively, consider ""BEIGE"": B-E-I-G-E -> tests B at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, E at5. Since E is already known to be at5, we are testing for another E at position2? But we know from guess1 that there is only one E? Actually, guess1 only showed one E (at the end). But if there is an E in position2, then in guess1 we didn\'t have E in position2, so we wouldn\'t have known.\n\nHowever, the feedback for ""crane"" didn\'t show any other E as being present but wrong position? Because if there was an E elsewhere, it would have been marked with \'-\'? But in ""crane"", we only had one E (at the end) and no other E in the guess? Actually, we guessed only one E.\n\nSo it\'s possible that there is an E in position2? The absence of evidence in the first guess doesn\'t prove there isn\'t another E.\n\nBut we are on the second guess? Wait, we\'ve only made two guesses.\n\nBut ""stole"" also didn\'t have any E at position2? Wait, we had E at the end only.\n\nSo we haven\'t tested E in any other position.\n\nTherefore, if we guess a word with E in position2, we might get a \'-\' if it is present but we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, to maximize letter coverage, we should try a word without E except at the end? Because we are limited to 5-letter words.\n\nGiven that we have 6 guesses, we can sacrifice a position to test the E duplication? But on the third guess, we can focus on letters.\n\nI think ""BEIGE"" is a good candidate? But it uses E twice? And the E in position2 is a test for duplication.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to reuse letters? The rules don\'t forbid it.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s look for a word that doesn\'t have E in any other position, so we test only new letters.\n\nFor example: ""PUDGE"" -> P-U-D-G-E -> all new letters except E at the end? That\'s good.\n\nIs ""PUDGE"" a word? It\'s slang? Or ""FUDGE""? F-U-D-G-E -> yes, ""fudge"" is a valid word.\n\n""FUDGE"": F-U-D-G-E -> uses F, U, D, G, E. \n- F is new, not in absent list? Absent: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L -> F is not in there.\n- U, D, G are also new.\n\nSo ""FUDGE"" would be a safe guess: we test F, U, D, G, and E (known).\n\nSimilarly, ""DODGE""? But O and D? O is absent? So invalid.\n\n""WEDGE"": W-E-D-G-E -> but E is in position2? Again, testing for an extra E? And we test W, D, G.\n\nBut ""fudge"" avoids any extra E.\n\nSo I think ""FUDGE"" is a better candidate than ""GUIDE"" because it uses common letters? F, U, D, G are all common enough.\n\nAnother word: ""MIDGE"" -> M-I-D-G-E -> M, I, D, G, E -> also valid.\n\nBut ""fudge"" versus ""midge""? Both are valid.\n\nWe choose one. Let\'s go with ""FUDGE"".\n\nBut we must confirm: all letters in ""FUDGE"" are not in the absent list: F, U, D, G are not in {C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L}.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, our next guess is ""FUDGE"".\n\nBut wait, we haven\'t tested the letter B? Or P? There are many letters left.\n\nWe have to make a choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""PURGE""? But U, R? But R is absent? So invalid.\n\n""INODE""? Not a word.\n\n""QUAKE""? But A is absent? Invalid.\n\n""JUICE""? J-U-I-C-E -> C is absent? Invalid.\n\nSo ""FUDGE"" seems good.\n\nAlso, words like ""BADGE"" are invalid because A is absent.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""FUDGE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter). C, R, A, N are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""stole""):** E is confirmed in position 5. S, T, O, L are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word ends with **E**.\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L (8 total).\n- The word must be of the form `[?][?][?][?]E`, avoiding the absent letters.\n- Remaining common letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Focus on introducing new high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested.\n- Avoid reusing absent letters and reuse E only in position 5.\n- Prioritize words that maximize coverage of new letters (e.g., F, U, D, G, H, M).\n- ""FUDGE"" is a strong candidate: \n  - Uses new letters: F, U, D, G (all untested).\n  - Ends with E (maintains known position).\n  - Tests 4 new letters in positions 1–4.\n\n<guess>fudge</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: fudge -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(-) D(x) G(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is correct and in position 5.
- C, R, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: ""stole"" -> S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is correct in position 5 (confirmed).
- S, T, O, L are absent.

Guess 3: ""fudge"" -> F(x) U(-) D(x) G(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- U is present in the word but not in position 2.
- E is correct in position 5.
- F, D, G are absent.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must end with E (position 5).
- Contains the letter U, but not in position 2.
- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, F, D, G.

Additionally, we know that U is in the word, but not in position 2.

The secret word has the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

Constraints on letters:
- The word must include U (somewhere not position 2).
- Exclude: A, C, D, F, G, L, N, O, R, S, T.

Available letters (from common English letters): B, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, and U is already included? But U must be in the word, so we have to place it in one of positions 1, 3, or 4? But wait: the word must have U somewhere. Our guess must account for that.

We also have the feedback that U is in the word (wrong position) from guess 3.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter word ending in E (since we know position 5 is E).
- Includes the letter U in a position other than 2? Actually, position 2 was wrong, but it could be in 1, 3, or 4? Actually, positions 1,3,4, or ...? The secret word has U somewhere in the first four positions, but not at index 2? Because we guessed U at position 2 and got '-', meaning it is present but not there. Therefore, U must be in position 1, 3, or 4? Wait: indices: 1,2,3,4,5. So U is in position 1, 3, or 4? Or possibly 5? But 5 is E, so U cannot be in position 5. Therefore, U must be in position 1, 3, or 4? No, wait: position 5 is E and fixed, so U must be in one of the first four positions. But not position 2 (from guess 3). Therefore, U is in position 1, 3, or 4.

Our guess should test which position U is in, while also testing new letters.

But note: we also have to avoid the absent letters.

List of absent letters so far (from all feedback): 
C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, F, D, G

So available letters: B, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, and U is already in the word? We must use U because we know it's present? Actually, we are trying to guess the word, so we can include U to figure out its position.

We must form a word with the available letters and having U in position 1, 3, or 4? And ending with E.

But note: we don't have to guess U again? We know U is present, so we can try to guess words that include U? But we can also guess words without U? However, we know U is in the secret word? So if we don't include U in a guess, we might not get information about its position? But since we know U is present, we should use our guess to pinpoint its position? Or test new letters?

But we don't know the position of U yet, so we should try to cover it? Actually, we have limited guesses (6 total, this is the fourth). So we should form a word that includes U and tests it in one of the possible positions, while introducing new letters.

We can also use multiple U's? But that might be tricky.

Let's list words that end with E, include U, and avoid absent letters, and have U not in position 2? But since we know U is not in position 2, we can put U in position 1, 3, or 4? And then the other positions are new letters.

For example:
- Position 1: U? Then word: U _ _ _ E
  - Examples: ""USAGE"" -> but S and A are absent? Invalid.
    ""URINE"" -> R absent? Invalid.
    ""UTILE"" -> T and L absent? Invalid.
    ""UMPIE""? Not a word.
    ""UMPTE""? Not a word.

  Possible: ""UPPER""? Doesn't end with E? ""UPPEE""? Not a word. ""UPTIE""? Not common.

  How about ""UNWED""? But N and D absent? Invalid.

  This is difficult.

- Position 3: _ _ U _ E
  - Examples: ""MUTED"" -> D absent? Invalid.
    ""JUWEL""? Not standard.
    ""HAUTE"" -> H-A-U-T-E -> but A and T absent? Invalid.
    ""EQUIP""? Doesn't end with E? ""EQUIPE""? 6 letters? Not.

  How about ""EQUIP"" -> 5 letters? But ends with P? No.

  ""PIQUE"": P-I-Q-U-E -> this is a valid word? Yes. And P, I, Q are new? And U is in position 4? Actually, ""PIQUE"" is P-I-Q-U-E -> positions:1:P,2:I,3:Q,4:U,5:E? But our secret word ends with E (pos5), so yes.

  But is Q available? Absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L,F,D,G -> Q is not in that list? So Q can be used? But we haven't tested Q? So yes.

  ""PIQUE"": uses P, I, Q, U, E -> but U is in position 4? Which we haven't tested before? And this guess would test if U appears in position 4? And we test P, I, Q.

- Position 4: _ _ _ U E? But then the word ends with ""UE""? Actually, that's common? Like ""ARGUE"", but A and R absent? Invalid.

  ""VENUE"" -> V-E-N-U-E -> but N is absent? Invalid.
  ""QUEUE"" -> Q-U-E-U-E -> ends with E? And U in position2 and position4? But we know U is not in position 2? Wait, in ""QUEUE"", if we guess it, then position4 is U? But then U at position2: we know it's not? Because in guess3 we had U at2 as '-' meaning wrong position? But now we are guessing U at position2 again? That's allowed? But we'd get a '-' or 'x'? Actually, the secret word could have U at position4? And if we guess U at position2 again, we might get 'x'? Because if the secret word doesn't have a U at2, then this guess at2 would be wrong? But we know U is in the secret word? So if we guess U at a position where it's not, it would be '-'.

But let's not complicate: the position for U must be 1,3, or4? So guessing at position4 is valid?

But ""PIQUE"" places U at position4? So that's one candidate.

Alternatively, place U at position1: what words are there? ""UNITE"" -> N and T absent? Invalid. ""UNDUE"" -> N and D absent? Invalid.

Place U at position3: ""BUXOM"" doesn't end with E? ""BUMPY"" not E? Words: ""BUCKET"" too long? ""MAUVE"" -> M-A-U-V-E -> A absent? Invalid. ""HAUGE""? Not standard? ""QUOTE"" -> O and T absent? Invalid. ""QUIFF"" not ending in E? ""MUTED"" -> D absent? Invalid. ""QUIRE"" -> R absent? Invalid. ""QUINE"" -> N present? Absent? N is absent? So invalid.

So ""PIQUE"" seems a valid option? But it uses Q? And it's uncommon? But acceptable.

Other options: ""JUMBLE"" too long? Or ""JUMPS"" no E? ""VERVE"" ends with E? V-E-R-V-E -> R absent? Invalid.

""QUITE"" -> Q-U-I-T-E -> but T is absent? Invalid.

""PIXIE"" -> ends with E? P-I-X-I-E? But no U? And we need to include U? Because we know U is present? So if we don't include U, then we are risking? But we can guess without U? However, the feedback would tell us if U is in the word? But we already know U is present, so if we don't guess U, we won't get information on its position? We should include U to help track it? But we have positions 1,3,4 to test for U.

So we can try a word placing U at position1? For example: ""UBIETY"" too long? Not 5 letters. ""UGLIE"" -> but L and G absent? Invalid. Not possible?

Place U at position3: ""BAUDRY""? Not 5 letters? ""CAPUT"" no E? ""HYPED"" no U? This is difficult.

Another word with U at position4: ""PIQUE"" is one. ""JUNKY"" no E? ""BARQUE"" too long? ""QUEUE"" -> Q-U-E-U-E -> but U is at position2 and position4? But we know U is not at position2? So in ""QUEUE"", we are putting U at position2 and position4? But the secret word might have U at position4? Then in the feedback, U at position2 would be wrong (should be 'x') because we know U isn't there? But we are guessing U at2 again? That's allowed? And we are testing U at position4? But it might yield '-'? Actually, if U is at4, then:

Guess: QUEUE -> Q(?), U at2 (should be absent? But no: the secret has U only at4? So U at2 would be present but wrong position? But wait, we already have U at2 in guess3 and got '-' meaning present but wrong position? So if U is at4, then when we guess QUEUE:

- Q at1: could be x or ✓? 
- U at2: present? But in the secret word there is a U at4? So U at2: not present? Because the secret word has U only at4? Actually, if the secret word has one U at4, then guessing U at2 would be '-' because the U is in the word but not at that position? Unless there is another U? But the secret word might have two U's? We don't know.

But the feedback would show '-' for U at any position that is not exactly the right one? And separately for each occurrence.

So if the secret word has only one U at position4, then:
- If we guess U at2: '-' because it's in the word but wrong position? Then U at4: ✓? Because correct? And if we have two U's? Then we mark accordingly? But we don't know.

Therefore, guessing ""QUEUE"" might yield:
  Q(x) U(-) E(?) U(?) E(✓) -> but E in position3: we know position5 is E? But position3 E? Could be '-' if there's another E? But we don't know if there is another E.

Complex? So let me avoid ""QUEUE"".

So perhaps ""PIQUE"" is a better choice? It puts U at position4? So we are testing U in position4? And Q at position3? Which is new.

But Q might be less common? And we haven't tried Q? We are introducing a rare letter? But possible.

Other possibilities: 
  ""QUIFF"" -> doesn't end with E? ""GUAVA"" -> G absent? We cannot use G? G is absent? From guess3: G(x) meaning absent? So we cannot use G? And F,D,G absent.

In ""PIQUE"", we avoid absent letters: only P, I, Q, U? Are available? P, I, Q are not in the absent list: absent are C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L,F,D,G -> so P, I, Q are allowed? Yes.

Therefore, ""PIQUE"" is valid? But does it end with E? P-I-Q-U-E -> positions:1=P,2=I,3=Q,4=U,5=E -> ends with E? Yes.

So we can guess ""PIQUE""?

But we are also testing new letters: P, I, Q? And U at a new position (4).

Alternatively, consider a word with U at position3? Or position1? But struggling? So we'll go with ""PIQUE"".

But note: we have another possibility? What about ""MUNCH""? No E ending? ""VINEW"" not a word? ""BIJOU"" doesn't end with E? ""PIQUE"" seems the best.

Another word: ""JUDGE""? But D and G absent? Invalid.

So I think we should try ""PIQUE"".

But let's think: what if the U is not in position4? Then we will get a '-' for U? But we are putting U in position4? So if U is elsewhere, we'll know? And mark other positions? We are testing position4.

Moreover, P and I are common? But I haven't been tested? So we'll get information about P and I? And Q? Which might not be? But even if Q is rare, we test it? And then if absent, we know that Q is not in the word? So we can eliminate.

Therefore, we choose ""PIQUE"".We are given feedback for Guess 3 (""fudge""): U is present but not in position 2. This narrows down U's position to either 1, 3, or 4. 

### Constraints So Far:
- **Absent letters:** A, C, D, F, G, L, N, O, R, S, T (11 letters).
- **Present letters:** 
  - E (position 5 confirmed).
  - U (present, not in position 2; must be in position 1, 3, or 4).
- Remaining pool of common letters: B, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Prioritize testing U's position (1, 3, or 4) while introducing new letters.
- End with E (leverage confirmed position 5).
- ""PIQUE"" (P-I-Q-U-E) fits:
  - Tests U in position 4.
  - Uses new high-frequency letters (P, I) and Q for exploration.
  - Avoids all absent letters.
  - Ends with E.

<guess>pique</guess>.
</think>
Based on previous feedback:
- **E is confirmed in position 5**.
- **U is present** but not in position 2 (must be in position 1, 3, or 4).
- **Absent letters**: A, C, D, F, G, L, N, O, R, S, T.

For the next guess:
- Prioritize testing U in a new position (1, 3, or 4) while leveraging E in position 5.
- Introduce new untested letters from the remaining pool (B, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y).
- ""PIQUE"" (P-I-Q-U-E) fits:
  - Places U in position 4 to test its location.
  - Uses new common letters P and I, plus Q for exploration.
  - Avoids all absent letters.
  - Ends with E (maintains known position).

<guess>pique</guess>",pique,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is correct and in position 5.
- C, R, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: ""stole"" -> S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is correct in position 5 (confirmed).
- S, T, O, L are absent.

Guess 3: ""fudge"" -> F(x) U(-) D(x) G(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- U is present in the word but not in position 2.
- E is correct in position 5.
- F, D, G are absent.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must end with E (position 5).
- Contains the letter U, but not in position 2.
- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, F, D, G.

Additionally, we know that U is in the word, but not in position 2.

The secret word has the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

Constraints on letters:
- The word must include U (somewhere not position 2).
- Exclude: A, C, D, F, G, L, N, O, R, S, T.

Available letters (from common English letters): B, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, and U is already included? But U must be in the word, so we have to place it in one of positions 1, 3, or 4? But wait: the word must have U somewhere. Our guess must account for that.

We also have the feedback that U is in the word (wrong position) from guess 3.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter word ending in E (since we know position 5 is E).
- Includes the letter U in a position other than 2? Actually, position 2 was wrong, but it could be in 1, 3, or 4? Actually, positions 1,3,4, or ...? The secret word has U somewhere in the first four positions, but not at index 2? Because we guessed U at position 2 and got '-', meaning it is present but not there. Therefore, U must be in position 1, 3, or 4? Wait: indices: 1,2,3,4,5. So U is in position 1, 3, or 4? Or possibly 5? But 5 is E, so U cannot be in position 5. Therefore, U must be in position 1, 3, or 4? No, wait: position 5 is E and fixed, so U must be in one of the first four positions. But not position 2 (from guess 3). Therefore, U is in position 1, 3, or 4.

Our guess should test which position U is in, while also testing new letters.

But note: we also have to avoid the absent letters.

List of absent letters so far (from all feedback): 
C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, F, D, G

So available letters: B, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, and U is already in the word? We must use U because we know it's present? Actually, we are trying to guess the word, so we can include U to figure out its position.

We must form a word with the available letters and having U in position 1, 3, or 4? And ending with E.

But note: we don't have to guess U again? We know U is present, so we can try to guess words that include U? But we can also guess words without U? However, we know U is in the secret word? So if we don't include U in a guess, we might not get information about its position? But since we know U is present, we should use our guess to pinpoint its position? Or test new letters?

But we don't know the position of U yet, so we should try to cover it? Actually, we have limited guesses (6 total, this is the fourth). So we should form a word that includes U and tests it in one of the possible positions, while introducing new letters.

We can also use multiple U's? But that might be tricky.

Let's list words that end with E, include U, and avoid absent letters, and have U not in position 2? But since we know U is not in position 2, we can put U in position 1, 3, or 4? And then the other positions are new letters.

For example:
- Position 1: U? Then word: U _ _ _ E
  - Examples: ""USAGE"" -> but S and A are absent? Invalid.
    ""URINE"" -> R absent? Invalid.
    ""UTILE"" -> T and L absent? Invalid.
    ""UMPIE""? Not a word.
    ""UMPTE""? Not a word.

  Possible: ""UPPER""? Doesn't end with E? ""UPPEE""? Not a word. ""UPTIE""? Not common.

  How about ""UNWED""? But N and D absent? Invalid.

  This is difficult.

- Position 3: _ _ U _ E
  - Examples: ""MUTED"" -> D absent? Invalid.
    ""JUWEL""? Not standard.
    ""HAUTE"" -> H-A-U-T-E -> but A and T absent? Invalid.
    ""EQUIP""? Doesn't end with E? ""EQUIPE""? 6 letters? Not.

  How about ""EQUIP"" -> 5 letters? But ends with P? No.

  ""PIQUE"": P-I-Q-U-E -> this is a valid word? Yes. And P, I, Q are new? And U is in position 4? Actually, ""PIQUE"" is P-I-Q-U-E -> positions:1:P,2:I,3:Q,4:U,5:E? But our secret word ends with E (pos5), so yes.

  But is Q available? Absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L,F,D,G -> Q is not in that list? So Q can be used? But we haven't tested Q? So yes.

  ""PIQUE"": uses P, I, Q, U, E -> but U is in position 4? Which we haven't tested before? And this guess would test if U appears in position 4? And we test P, I, Q.

- Position 4: _ _ _ U E? But then the word ends with ""UE""? Actually, that's common? Like ""ARGUE"", but A and R absent? Invalid.

  ""VENUE"" -> V-E-N-U-E -> but N is absent? Invalid.
  ""QUEUE"" -> Q-U-E-U-E -> ends with E? And U in position2 and position4? But we know U is not in position 2? Wait, in ""QUEUE"", if we guess it, then position4 is U? But then U at position2: we know it's not? Because in guess3 we had U at2 as '-' meaning wrong position? But now we are guessing U at position2 again? That's allowed? But we'd get a '-' or 'x'? Actually, the secret word could have U at position4? And if we guess U at position2 again, we might get 'x'? Because if the secret word doesn't have a U at2, then this guess at2 would be wrong? But we know U is in the secret word? So if we guess U at a position where it's not, it would be '-'.

But let's not complicate: the position for U must be 1,3, or4? So guessing at position4 is valid?

But ""PIQUE"" places U at position4? So that's one candidate.

Alternatively, place U at position1: what words are there? ""UNITE"" -> N and T absent? Invalid. ""UNDUE"" -> N and D absent? Invalid.

Place U at position3: ""BUXOM"" doesn't end with E? ""BUMPY"" not E? Words: ""BUCKET"" too long? ""MAUVE"" -> M-A-U-V-E -> A absent? Invalid. ""HAUGE""? Not standard? ""QUOTE"" -> O and T absent? Invalid. ""QUIFF"" not ending in E? ""MUTED"" -> D absent? Invalid. ""QUIRE"" -> R absent? Invalid. ""QUINE"" -> N present? Absent? N is absent? So invalid.

So ""PIQUE"" seems a valid option? But it uses Q? And it's uncommon? But acceptable.

Other options: ""JUMBLE"" too long? Or ""JUMPS"" no E? ""VERVE"" ends with E? V-E-R-V-E -> R absent? Invalid.

""QUITE"" -> Q-U-I-T-E -> but T is absent? Invalid.

""PIXIE"" -> ends with E? P-I-X-I-E? But no U? And we need to include U? Because we know U is present? So if we don't include U, then we are risking? But we can guess without U? However, the feedback would tell us if U is in the word? But we already know U is present, so if we don't guess U, we won't get information on its position? We should include U to help track it? But we have positions 1,3,4 to test for U.

So we can try a word placing U at position1? For example: ""UBIETY"" too long? Not 5 letters. ""UGLIE"" -> but L and G absent? Invalid. Not possible?

Place U at position3: ""BAUDRY""? Not 5 letters? ""CAPUT"" no E? ""HYPED"" no U? This is difficult.

Another word with U at position4: ""PIQUE"" is one. ""JUNKY"" no E? ""BARQUE"" too long? ""QUEUE"" -> Q-U-E-U-E -> but U is at position2 and position4? But we know U is not at position2? So in ""QUEUE"", we are putting U at position2 and position4? But the secret word might have U at position4? Then in the feedback, U at position2 would be wrong (should be 'x') because we know U isn't there? But we are guessing U at2 again? That's allowed? And we are testing U at position4? But it might yield '-'? Actually, if U is at4, then:

Guess: QUEUE -> Q(?), U at2 (should be absent? But no: the secret has U only at4? So U at2 would be present but wrong position? But wait, we already have U at2 in guess3 and got '-' meaning present but wrong position? So if U is at4, then when we guess QUEUE:

- Q at1: could be x or ✓? 
- U at2: present? But in the secret word there is a U at4? So U at2: not present? Because the secret word has U only at4? Actually, if the secret word has one U at4, then guessing U at2 would be '-' because the U is in the word but not at that position? Unless there is another U? But the secret word might have two U's? We don't know.

But the feedback would show '-' for U at any position that is not exactly the right one? And separately for each occurrence.

So if the secret word has only one U at position4, then:
- If we guess U at2: '-' because it's in the word but wrong position? Then U at4: ✓? Because correct? And if we have two U's? Then we mark accordingly? But we don't know.

Therefore, guessing ""QUEUE"" might yield:
  Q(x) U(-) E(?) U(?) E(✓) -> but E in position3: we know position5 is E? But position3 E? Could be '-' if there's another E? But we don't know if there is another E.

Complex? So let me avoid ""QUEUE"".

So perhaps ""PIQUE"" is a better choice? It puts U at position4? So we are testing U in position4? And Q at position3? Which is new.

But Q might be less common? And we haven't tried Q? We are introducing a rare letter? But possible.

Other possibilities: 
  ""QUIFF"" -> doesn't end with E? ""GUAVA"" -> G absent? We cannot use G? G is absent? From guess3: G(x) meaning absent? So we cannot use G? And F,D,G absent.

In ""PIQUE"", we avoid absent letters: only P, I, Q, U? Are available? P, I, Q are not in the absent list: absent are C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L,F,D,G -> so P, I, Q are allowed? Yes.

Therefore, ""PIQUE"" is valid? But does it end with E? P-I-Q-U-E -> positions:1=P,2=I,3=Q,4=U,5=E -> ends with E? Yes.

So we can guess ""PIQUE""?

But we are also testing new letters: P, I, Q? And U at a new position (4).

Alternatively, consider a word with U at position3? Or position1? But struggling? So we'll go with ""PIQUE"".

But note: we have another possibility? What about ""MUNCH""? No E ending? ""VINEW"" not a word? ""BIJOU"" doesn't end with E? ""PIQUE"" seems the best.

Another word: ""JUDGE""? But D and G absent? Invalid.

So I think we should try ""PIQUE"".

But let's think: what if the U is not in position4? Then we will get a '-' for U? But we are putting U in position4? So if U is elsewhere, we'll know? And mark other positions? We are testing position4.

Moreover, P and I are common? But I haven't been tested? So we'll get information about P and I? And Q? Which might not be? But even if Q is rare, we test it? And then if absent, we know that Q is not in the word? So we can eliminate.

Therefore, we choose ""PIQUE"".We are given feedback for Guess 3 (""fudge""): U is present but not in position 2. This narrows down U's position to either 1, 3, or 4. 

### Constraints So Far:
- **Absent letters:** A, C, D, F, G, L, N, O, R, S, T (11 letters).
- **Present letters:** 
  - E (position 5 confirmed).
  - U (present, not in position 2; must be in position 1, 3, or 4).
- Remaining pool of common letters: B, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Prioritize testing U's position (1, 3, or 4) while introducing new letters.
- End with E (leverage confirmed position 5).
- ""PIQUE"" (P-I-Q-U-E) fits:
  - Tests U in position 4.
  - Uses new high-frequency letters (P, I) and Q for exploration.
  - Avoids all absent letters.
  - Ends with E.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

 This means:
 - E is in the secret word and is in the correct position. Since E is the last letter, we know the secret word ends with E.
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word is of the form _ _ _ _ E.

 Since C, R, A, N are absent, we must avoid these letters in our next guess.

 We also know that the word has an E in the fifth position.

 For our next guess, we should try to include other common letters that haven't been tried yet (avoiding C, R, A, N).

 Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, S, T, L, O, I, etc. We already know E is in the word (at the end).

 We can try a word that has new letters and ends with E? But note: the E is already in the correct position, so we don't need to test it again? 
 However, we might get more information by using E again? But the feedback for E will always be correct in the last position until we solve.

 But note: the feedback for the fifth letter is already known to be correct, so we can focus on the first four letters.

 We should choose a word that:
 - Ends with E (to confirm the pattern, but actually we already know that, so we can use that position to test other letters? 
   However, we are required to make a valid 5-letter word, and we know the last letter is E, so we can use that to our advantage by having a word ending in E.

 But also, we want to test new letters. Let's avoid the letters that are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Possible common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, M, P, etc.

 We can form a word that has new letters and ends with E.

 Some examples: 
   ""SLATE"" -> but A is absent (from previous feedback) so we cannot use A.
   ""ROUTE"" -> R is absent.
   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but we don't know about P, O, I, S.

 However, we must avoid A, R, C, N.

 Let's think of words ending in E that use common letters not yet tried.

 Some options:
   ""SPITE"" -> uses S, P, I, T, E -> all new letters.
   ""SLIME"" -> S, L, I, M, E -> but we don't know about S, L, I, M.
   ""SHINE"" -> but H is new, but N is absent -> we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N, so ""SHINE"" is invalid because of N.

 Another: ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E -> but O and L are new? But wait, we have to avoid A, R, C, N. O is allowed.

 However, we have to make sure we don't use any of the absent letters.

 Let me list the absent letters: C, R, A, N.

 So we can use any other letters.

 We want to maximize information: so we should try to include as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

 I think ""SLATE"" is not possible because of A (absent). Similarly, ""STARE"" has A and R (both absent).

 Let me try to form a word: 
   We need a 5-letter word ending in E, and the first four letters must not contain C, R, A, N.

 Some words:
   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E
   ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E
   ""GUISE"" -> G, U, I, S, E
   ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E
   ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E

 Among these, which one has the most common letters? 

 Since we are in the second guess, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 The most common consonants: S, T, L, ... and vowels: O, I.

 ""STOLE"" has S, T, O, L -> that's four common letters and then E (which we know). 
 But note: we already know E is in the word and in the correct position, so we are testing S, T, O, L in positions 1,2,3,4.

 Alternatively, ""SPITE"" has S, P, I, T -> P and I are also common.

 But let's look at frequency in English: 
   S, T, L, O, I, P, etc.

 I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate because it has S, T, O, L.

 However, we must consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn't show any duplicates so far, and we don't have any information.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" had all the other letters absent, so it's unlikely that the word has duplicates of E? But we don't know.

 We'll go with ""STOLE"".

 But wait: what if the word has an O? We don't know. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't have the E at the end? Actually, we know the last letter must be E, so we can use that to our advantage by having a word that ends in E to get more information about the other positions.

 However, we are allowed to use any valid word. But if we don't put E at the end, then we would be wasting the known correct position? 

 But the rules: we must guess a 5-letter word. We know the last letter is E, so it would be wise to use that to test the first four.

 Therefore, I will choose a word that ends with E and uses new letters.

 Let me choose ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E.

 So the guess is ""STOLE"".

 But note: we are not forced to use the known E at the end. We could use a word that has E in a different position to see if there is another E? 
 However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one E (at the end) and the other letters were absent. So if there was another E, then the feedback for the first E (in ""crane"") would have been a '-' if it was present but in the wrong position? 

 In ""crane"", the E was at the end and correct. The other E? There was only one E in ""crane"". 

 But the secret word might have two E's? For example, ""BELLE"" has two E's. However, in our feedback for ""crane"", we only got one E marked as correct. The other E in the secret word would have been in a position we didn't guess? 

 However, in ""crane"", we only tested one E. So if the secret word has two E's, then the other E would not have been revealed because we didn't guess it in that position.

 So it's possible that there is another E. But we don't know.

 To test for the presence of another E, we could put an E in a different position. However, we are only on the second guess, and we have limited information.

 Alternatively, we can focus on the structure: the word ends with E, and the first four letters are unknown (without C, R, A, N).

 I think it's more efficient to use the known E at the end and test new letters in the first four.

 Therefore, I will go with ""STOLE"".

 But let me check: is ""STOLE"" a valid word? Yes.

 So, next guess: ""STOLE""

<guess>stole</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is correct and in the right position (5th letter), so the secret word ends with **E**.
- **C, R, A, N** are absent and cannot be reused.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E** to leverage the known correct position.
- New letters should be tested in positions 1–4, avoiding **C, R, A, N**.
- Common letters like **S, T, O, L** are prioritized to maximize information.

The word **""STOLE""** fits these criteria:
- Ends with **E** (confirmed position).
- Tests **S, T, O, L** (all new, high-frequency letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (**C, R, A, N**).

<guess>stole</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
  - The letter E is in the secret word and is in the correct position (position 5).
  - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: ""stole"" -> S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
  - The letter E is again confirmed in position 5 (which we already knew).
  - The letters S, T, O, L are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has the following constraints:
1. It ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. It does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.

We have used 8 distinct letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.

The secret word is of the form [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E.

We must choose a new guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter word.
- Ends with E (to maintain the known correct position for E, though we could choose not to, but it helps narrow down).
- Avoids the 8 known absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.
- Introduces new letters to gain information.

We need to consider what letters are left. Common letters in English that haven't been tried:
Vowels: U, I (and sometimes Y)
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We should aim for a word that uses common remaining letters and ends with E.

Examples of common words ending in E:
- ""BIKE"" -> but K and E? But we need 5 letters? Wait, ""BIKE"" is 4 letters? Let me think of 5-letter words.

Potential words:
- ""PIQUE"": uses P, I, Q, U, E -> but Q and U are less common? And Q might be risky.
- ""JUICE"": uses J, U, I, C, E -> but C is already known absent? (from guess1) -> we cannot use C.
- ""DUNCE"": uses D, U, N, C, E -> but N and C are absent, so invalid.
- ""GUIDE"": uses G, U, I, D, E -> all new letters? G, U, I, D are not in the absent list.
- ""MIXED"": uses M, I, X, E, D -> ends with E? No, it ends with D. We need to end with E.
- ""DIMES"": ends with S -> but S is absent? Cannot use S.

We need words ending with E and avoiding the absent letters.

List some words:
- ""GUIDE"": G, U, I, D, E -> checks: G, U, I, D are not in {C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L}. So valid.
- ""QUIET"": ends with T? Not E.
- ""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> but the first letter is B and last is E. But note: we have two E's? And the word is [B][E][I][G][E]? Actually, ""beige"" is 5 letters: B-E-I-G-E. But position 5 is E? Yes. But what about the E in position 2? We don't know if there's another E. Also, avoiding absent: B, E, I, G -> E is already known to be present, but we can reuse E? However, we know E is in position 5, but the word might have E somewhere else? And we can test that.

But note: the absent letters we have are C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L. So B, I, G are allowed? Wait, ""beige"" uses E twice? We can use repeated letters? Yes, but we must account for the possibility.

But ""beige"" might be a good candidate? However, we are trying to introduce new letters. We already know E is present at the end, so the E in position 2 is additional.

However, we are allowed to guess words with repeated E? But let's see if we can form words with only new letters.

Alternatively, consider ""BUMPY""? Doesn't end with E.

Another candidate: ""GIVEN"": but ends with N? Wait, and N is absent? So invalid.

Possible words:
- ""PRIDE"": but R is absent (from guess1) -> invalid.
- ""BIKIE"": not standard? Or ""BIKE"" expanded? Not common.

More common words:
- ""PIECE"": P, I, E, C, E -> but C is absent? Invalid.
- ""QUEUE"": Q, U, E, U, E -> but we don't know about Q and U? And it has two U's. But the word ends with E? Yes. But Q and U are new? And we haven't tried them. Also, the absent letters? A, C, R, N, S, T, O, L are not including Q or U.
  However, ""queue"" is a valid English word? Yes.

But ""QUEUE"" might be uncommon? Also, it only introduces Q and U? Because E we know.

Perhaps ""GUIDE"" is better because it uses more common letters: G, U, I, D.

Another: ""PHASE"" -> but S and A are absent? Invalid.

""WHILE"" -> L and E? But L is absent? From guess2: L is absent -> invalid.

""MOVIE"" -> ends with E? Actually, ""movie"" is M-O-V-I-E -> 5 letters? Yes. But we cannot use O (absent) and M, V, I are new? So M, V, I, E. But O is absent? So invalid because O is absent.

""ABIDE"" -> A is absent? Invalid.

So after some thought, let's try ""GUIDE"" as a candidate.

But wait, ""GUIDE"": G-U-I-D-E. The E is in the end, correct. We test G at position1, U at2, I at3, D at4.

If the secret word has G, U, I, or D, we will get feedback.

Alternatively, consider ""BEIGE"": B-E-I-G-E -> tests B at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, E at5. Since E is already known to be at5, we are testing for another E at position2? But we know from guess1 that there is only one E? Actually, guess1 only showed one E (at the end). But if there is an E in position2, then in guess1 we didn't have E in position2, so we wouldn't have known.

However, the feedback for ""crane"" didn't show any other E as being present but wrong position? Because if there was an E elsewhere, it would have been marked with '-'? But in ""crane"", we only had one E (at the end) and no other E in the guess? Actually, we guessed only one E.

So it's possible that there is an E in position2? The absence of evidence in the first guess doesn't prove there isn't another E.

But we are on the second guess? Wait, we've only made two guesses.

But ""stole"" also didn't have any E at position2? Wait, we had E at the end only.

So we haven't tested E in any other position.

Therefore, if we guess a word with E in position2, we might get a '-' if it is present but we don't know.

However, to maximize letter coverage, we should try a word without E except at the end? Because we are limited to 5-letter words.

Given that we have 6 guesses, we can sacrifice a position to test the E duplication? But on the third guess, we can focus on letters.

I think ""BEIGE"" is a good candidate? But it uses E twice? And the E in position2 is a test for duplication.

But note: we are allowed to reuse letters? The rules don't forbid it.

Alternatively, let's look for a word that doesn't have E in any other position, so we test only new letters.

For example: ""PUDGE"" -> P-U-D-G-E -> all new letters except E at the end? That's good.

Is ""PUDGE"" a word? It's slang? Or ""FUDGE""? F-U-D-G-E -> yes, ""fudge"" is a valid word.

""FUDGE"": F-U-D-G-E -> uses F, U, D, G, E. 
- F is new, not in absent list? Absent: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L -> F is not in there.
- U, D, G are also new.

So ""FUDGE"" would be a safe guess: we test F, U, D, G, and E (known).

Similarly, ""DODGE""? But O and D? O is absent? So invalid.

""WEDGE"": W-E-D-G-E -> but E is in position2? Again, testing for an extra E? And we test W, D, G.

But ""fudge"" avoids any extra E.

So I think ""FUDGE"" is a better candidate than ""GUIDE"" because it uses common letters? F, U, D, G are all common enough.

Another word: ""MIDGE"" -> M-I-D-G-E -> M, I, D, G, E -> also valid.

But ""fudge"" versus ""midge""? Both are valid.

We choose one. Let's go with ""FUDGE"".

But we must confirm: all letters in ""FUDGE"" are not in the absent list: F, U, D, G are not in {C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L}.

Yes.

Therefore, our next guess is ""FUDGE"".

But wait, we haven't tested the letter B? Or P? There are many letters left.

We have to make a choice.

Alternatively, ""PURGE""? But U, R? But R is absent? So invalid.

""INODE""? Not a word.

""QUAKE""? But A is absent? Invalid.

""JUICE""? J-U-I-C-E -> C is absent? Invalid.

So ""FUDGE"" seems good.

Also, words like ""BADGE"" are invalid because A is absent.

Therefore, I choose ""FUDGE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter). C, R, A, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""stole""):** E is confirmed in position 5. S, T, O, L are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word ends with **E**.
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L (8 total).
- The word must be of the form `[?][?][?][?]E`, avoiding the absent letters.
- Remaining common letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Focus on introducing new high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested.
- Avoid reusing absent letters and reuse E only in position 5.
- Prioritize words that maximize coverage of new letters (e.g., F, U, D, G, H, M).
- ""FUDGE"" is a strong candidate: 
  - Uses new letters: F, U, D, G (all untested).
  - Ends with E (maintains known position).
  - Tests 4 new letters in positions 1–4.

<guess>fudge</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: fudge -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(-) D(x) G(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is correct and in position 5.
- C, R, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: ""stole"" -> S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- E is correct in position 5 (confirmed).
- S, T, O, L are absent.

Guess 3: ""fudge"" -> F(x) U(-) D(x) G(x) E(✓)
Meaning:
- U is present in the word but not in position 2.
- E is correct in position 5.
- F, D, G are absent.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must end with E (position 5).
- Contains the letter U, but not in position 2.
- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, F, D, G.

Additionally, we know that U is in the word, but not in position 2.

The secret word has the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E

Constraints on letters:
- The word must include U (somewhere not position 2).
- Exclude: A, C, D, F, G, L, N, O, R, S, T.

Available letters (from common English letters): B, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, and U is already included? But U must be in the word, so we have to place it in one of positions 1, 3, or 4? But wait: the word must have U somewhere. Our guess must account for that.

We also have the feedback that U is in the word (wrong position) from guess 3.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter word ending in E (since we know position 5 is E).
- Includes the letter U in a position other than 2? Actually, position 2 was wrong, but it could be in 1, 3, or 4? Actually, positions 1,3,4, or ...? The secret word has U somewhere in the first four positions, but not at index 2? Because we guessed U at position 2 and got '-', meaning it is present but not there. Therefore, U must be in position 1, 3, or 4? Wait: indices: 1,2,3,4,5. So U is in position 1, 3, or 4? Or possibly 5? But 5 is E, so U cannot be in position 5. Therefore, U must be in position 1, 3, or 4? No, wait: position 5 is E and fixed, so U must be in one of the first four positions. But not position 2 (from guess 3). Therefore, U is in position 1, 3, or 4.

Our guess should test which position U is in, while also testing new letters.

But note: we also have to avoid the absent letters.

List of absent letters so far (from all feedback): 
C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, F, D, G

So available letters: B, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, and U is already in the word? We must use U because we know it's present? Actually, we are trying to guess the word, so we can include U to figure out its position.

We must form a word with the available letters and having U in position 1, 3, or 4? And ending with E.

But note: we don't have to guess U again? We know U is present, so we can try to guess words that include U? But we can also guess words without U? However, we know U is in the secret word? So if we don't include U in a guess, we might not get information about its position? But since we know U is present, we should use our guess to pinpoint its position? Or test new letters?

But we don't know the position of U yet, so we should try to cover it? Actually, we have limited guesses (6 total, this is the fourth). So we should form a word that includes U and tests it in one of the possible positions, while introducing new letters.

We can also use multiple U's? But that might be tricky.

Let's list words that end with E, include U, and avoid absent letters, and have U not in position 2? But since we know U is not in position 2, we can put U in position 1, 3, or 4? And then the other positions are new letters.

For example:
- Position 1: U? Then word: U _ _ _ E
  - Examples: ""USAGE"" -> but S and A are absent? Invalid.
    ""URINE"" -> R absent? Invalid.
    ""UTILE"" -> T and L absent? Invalid.
    ""UMPIE""? Not a word.
    ""UMPTE""? Not a word.

  Possible: ""UPPER""? Doesn't end with E? ""UPPEE""? Not a word. ""UPTIE""? Not common.

  How about ""UNWED""? But N and D absent? Invalid.

  This is difficult.

- Position 3: _ _ U _ E
  - Examples: ""MUTED"" -> D absent? Invalid.
    ""JUWEL""? Not standard.
    ""HAUTE"" -> H-A-U-T-E -> but A and T absent? Invalid.
    ""EQUIP""? Doesn't end with E? ""EQUIPE""? 6 letters? Not.

  How about ""EQUIP"" -> 5 letters? But ends with P? No.

  ""PIQUE"": P-I-Q-U-E -> this is a valid word? Yes. And P, I, Q are new? And U is in position 4? Actually, ""PIQUE"" is P-I-Q-U-E -> positions:1:P,2:I,3:Q,4:U,5:E? But our secret word ends with E (pos5), so yes.

  But is Q available? Absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L,F,D,G -> Q is not in that list? So Q can be used? But we haven't tested Q? So yes.

  ""PIQUE"": uses P, I, Q, U, E -> but U is in position 4? Which we haven't tested before? And this guess would test if U appears in position 4? And we test P, I, Q.

- Position 4: _ _ _ U E? But then the word ends with ""UE""? Actually, that's common? Like ""ARGUE"", but A and R absent? Invalid.

  ""VENUE"" -> V-E-N-U-E -> but N is absent? Invalid.
  ""QUEUE"" -> Q-U-E-U-E -> ends with E? And U in position2 and position4? But we know U is not in position 2? Wait, in ""QUEUE"", if we guess it, then position4 is U? But then U at position2: we know it's not? Because in guess3 we had U at2 as '-' meaning wrong position? But now we are guessing U at position2 again? That's allowed? But we'd get a '-' or 'x'? Actually, the secret word could have U at position4? And if we guess U at position2 again, we might get 'x'? Because if the secret word doesn't have a U at2, then this guess at2 would be wrong? But we know U is in the secret word? So if we guess U at a position where it's not, it would be '-'.

But let's not complicate: the position for U must be 1,3, or4? So guessing at position4 is valid?

But ""PIQUE"" places U at position4? So that's one candidate.

Alternatively, place U at position1: what words are there? ""UNITE"" -> N and T absent? Invalid. ""UNDUE"" -> N and D absent? Invalid.

Place U at position3: ""BUXOM"" doesn't end with E? ""BUMPY"" not E? Words: ""BUCKET"" too long? ""MAUVE"" -> M-A-U-V-E -> A absent? Invalid. ""HAUGE""? Not standard? ""QUOTE"" -> O and T absent? Invalid. ""QUIFF"" not ending in E? ""MUTED"" -> D absent? Invalid. ""QUIRE"" -> R absent? Invalid. ""QUINE"" -> N present? Absent? N is absent? So invalid.

So ""PIQUE"" seems a valid option? But it uses Q? And it's uncommon? But acceptable.

Other options: ""JUMBLE"" too long? Or ""JUMPS"" no E? ""VERVE"" ends with E? V-E-R-V-E -> R absent? Invalid.

""QUITE"" -> Q-U-I-T-E -> but T is absent? Invalid.

""PIXIE"" -> ends with E? P-I-X-I-E? But no U? And we need to include U? Because we know U is present? So if we don't include U, then we are risking? But we can guess without U? However, the feedback would tell us if U is in the word? But we already know U is present, so if we don't guess U, we won't get information on its position? We should include U to help track it? But we have positions 1,3,4 to test for U.

So we can try a word placing U at position1? For example: ""UBIETY"" too long? Not 5 letters. ""UGLIE"" -> but L and G absent? Invalid. Not possible?

Place U at position3: ""BAUDRY""? Not 5 letters? ""CAPUT"" no E? ""HYPED"" no U? This is difficult.

Another word with U at position4: ""PIQUE"" is one. ""JUNKY"" no E? ""BARQUE"" too long? ""QUEUE"" -> Q-U-E-U-E -> but U is at position2 and position4? But we know U is not at position2? So in ""QUEUE"", we are putting U at position2 and position4? But the secret word might have U at position4? Then in the feedback, U at position2 would be wrong (should be 'x') because we know U isn't there? But we are guessing U at2 again? That's allowed? And we are testing U at position4? But it might yield '-'? Actually, if U is at4, then:

Guess: QUEUE -> Q(?), U at2 (should be absent? But no: the secret has U only at4? So U at2 would be present but wrong position? But wait, we already have U at2 in guess3 and got '-' meaning present but wrong position? So if U is at4, then when we guess QUEUE:

- Q at1: could be x or ✓? 
- U at2: present? But in the secret word there is a U at4? So U at2: not present? Because the secret word has U only at4? Actually, if the secret word has one U at4, then guessing U at2 would be '-' because the U is in the word but not at that position? Unless there is another U? But the secret word might have two U's? We don't know.

But the feedback would show '-' for U at any position that is not exactly the right one? And separately for each occurrence.

So if the secret word has only one U at position4, then:
- If we guess U at2: '-' because it's in the word but wrong position? Then U at4: ✓? Because correct? And if we have two U's? Then we mark accordingly? But we don't know.

Therefore, guessing ""QUEUE"" might yield:
  Q(x) U(-) E(?) U(?) E(✓) -> but E in position3: we know position5 is E? But position3 E? Could be '-' if there's another E? But we don't know if there is another E.

Complex? So let me avoid ""QUEUE"".

So perhaps ""PIQUE"" is a better choice? It puts U at position4? So we are testing U in position4? And Q at position3? Which is new.

But Q might be less common? And we haven't tried Q? We are introducing a rare letter? But possible.

Other possibilities: 
  ""QUIFF"" -> doesn't end with E? ""GUAVA"" -> G absent? We cannot use G? G is absent? From guess3: G(x) meaning absent? So we cannot use G? And F,D,G absent.

In ""PIQUE"", we avoid absent letters: only P, I, Q, U? Are available? P, I, Q are not in the absent list: absent are C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L,F,D,G -> so P, I, Q are allowed? Yes.

Therefore, ""PIQUE"" is valid? But does it end with E? P-I-Q-U-E -> positions:1=P,2=I,3=Q,4=U,5=E -> ends with E? Yes.

So we can guess ""PIQUE""?

But we are also testing new letters: P, I, Q? And U at a new position (4).

Alternatively, consider a word with U at position3? Or position1? But struggling? So we'll go with ""PIQUE"".

But note: we have another possibility? What about ""MUNCH""? No E ending? ""VINEW"" not a word? ""BIJOU"" doesn't end with E? ""PIQUE"" seems the best.

Another word: ""JUDGE""? But D and G absent? Invalid.

So I think we should try ""PIQUE"".

But let's think: what if the U is not in position4? Then we will get a '-' for U? But we are putting U in position4? So if U is elsewhere, we'll know? And mark other positions? We are testing position4.

Moreover, P and I are common? But I haven't been tested? So we'll get information about P and I? And Q? Which might not be? But even if Q is rare, we test it? And then if absent, we know that Q is not in the word? So we can eliminate.

Therefore, we choose ""PIQUE"".We are given feedback for Guess 3 (""fudge""): U is present but not in position 2. This narrows down U's position to either 1, 3, or 4. 

### Constraints So Far:
- **Absent letters:** A, C, D, F, G, L, N, O, R, S, T (11 letters).
- **Present letters:** 
  - E (position 5 confirmed).
  - U (present, not in position 2; must be in position 1, 3, or 4).
- Remaining pool of common letters: B, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Prioritize testing U's position (1, 3, or 4) while introducing new letters.
- End with E (leverage confirmed position 5).
- ""PIQUE"" (P-I-Q-U-E) fits:
  - Tests U in position 4.
  - Uses new high-frequency letters (P, I) and Q for exploration.
  - Avoids all absent letters.
  - Ends with E.

<guess>pique</guess>.Based on previous feedback:
- **E is confirmed in position 5**.
- **U is present** but not in position 2 (must be in position 1, 3, or 4).
- **Absent letters**: A, C, D, F, G, L, N, O, R, S, T.

For the next guess:
- Prioritize testing U in a new position (1, 3, or 4) while leveraging E in position 5.
- Introduce new untested letters from the remaining pool (B, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y).
- ""PIQUE"" (P-I-Q-U-E) fits:
  - Places U in position 4 to test its location.
  - Uses new common letters P and I, plus Q for exploration.
  - Avoids all absent letters.
  - Ends with E (maintains known position).

O is allowed.\n\n However, we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the absent letters.\n\n Let me list the absent letters: C, R, A, N.\n\n So we can use any other letters.\n\n We want to maximize information: so we should try to include as many new common letters as possible.\n\n Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\n I think ""SLATE"" is not possible because of A (absent). Similarly, ""STARE"" has A and R (both absent).\n\n Let me try to form a word: \n   We need a 5-letter word ending in E, and the first four letters must not contain C, R, A, N.\n\n Some words:\n   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E\n   ""MOUSE"" -> M, O, U, S, E\n   ""GUISE"" -> G, U, I, S, E\n   ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E\n   ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E\n\n Among these, which one has the most common letters? \n\n Since we are in the second guess, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n The most common consonants: S, T, L, ... and vowels: O, I.\n\n ""STOLE"" has S, T, O, L -> that\'s four common letters and then E (which we know). \n But note: we already know E is in the word and in the correct position, so we are testing S, T, O, L in positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPITE"" has S, P, I, T -> P and I are also common.\n\n But let\'s look at frequency in English: \n   S, T, L, O, I, P, etc.\n\n I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate because it has S, T, O, L.\n\n However, we must consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn\'t show any duplicates so far, and we don\'t have any information.\n\n But note: the feedback for ""crane"" had all the other letters absent, so it\'s unlikely that the word has duplicates of E? But we don\'t know.\n\n We\'ll go with ""STOLE"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has an O? We don\'t know. We are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t have the E at the end? Actually, we know the last letter must be E, so we can use that to our advantage by having a word that ends in E to get more information about the other positions.\n\n However, we are allowed to use any valid word. But if we don\'t put E at the end, then we would be wasting the known correct position? \n\n But the rules: we must guess a 5-letter word. We know the last letter is E, so it would be wise to use that to test the first four.\n\n Therefore, I will choose a word that ends with E and uses new letters.\n\n Let me choose ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E.\n\n So the guess is ""STOLE"".\n\n But note: we are not forced to use the known E at the end. We could use a word that has E in a different position to see if there is another E? \n However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one E (at the end) and the other letters were absent. So if there was another E, then the feedback for the first E (in ""crane"") would have been a \'-\' if it was present but in the wrong position? \n\n In ""crane"", the E was at the end and correct. The other E? There was only one E in ""crane"". \n\n But the secret word might have two E\'s? For example, ""BELLE"" has two E\'s. However, in our feedback for ""crane"", we only got one E marked as correct. The other E in the secret word would have been in a position we didn\'t guess? \n\n However, in ""crane"", we only tested one E. So if the secret word has two E\'s, then the other E would not have been revealed because we didn\'t guess it in that position.\n\n So it\'s possible that there is another E. But we don\'t know.\n\n To test for the presence of another E, we could put an E in a different position. However, we are only on the second guess, and we have limited information.\n\n Alternatively, we can focus on the structure: the word ends with E, and the first four letters are unknown (without C, R, A, N).\n\n I think it\'s more efficient to use the known E at the end and test new letters in the first four.\n\n Therefore, I will go with ""STOLE"".\n\n But let me check: is ""STOLE"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n So, next guess: ""STOLE""\n\n<guess>stole</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **E** is correct and in the right position (5th letter), so the secret word ends with **E**.\n- **C, R, A, N** are absent and cannot be reused.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with **E** to leverage the known correct position.\n- New letters should be tested in positions 1–4, avoiding **C, R, A, N**.\n- Common letters like **S, T, O, L** are prioritized to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""STOLE""** fits these criteria:\n- Ends with **E** (confirmed position).\n- Tests **S, T, O, L** (all new, high-frequency letters).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (**C, R, A, N**).\n\n<guess>stole</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nThis tells us:\n  - The letter E is in the secret word and is in the correct position (position 5).\n  - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n\nGuess 2: ""stole"" -> S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)\nThis tells us:\n  - The letter E is again confirmed in position 5 (which we already knew).\n  - The letters S, T, O, L are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the following constraints:\n1. It ends with E (position 5 is E).\n2. It does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.\n\nWe have used 8 distinct letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.\n\nThe secret word is of the form [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E.\n\nWe must choose a new guess that:\n- Is a valid 5-letter word.\n- Ends with E (to maintain the known correct position for E, though we could choose not to, but it helps narrow down).\n- Avoids the 8 known absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L.\n- Introduces new letters to gain information.\n\nWe need to consider what letters are left. Common letters in English that haven\'t been tried:\nVowels: U, I (and sometimes Y)\nConsonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe should aim for a word that uses common remaining letters and ends with E.\n\nExamples of common words ending in E:\n- ""BIKE"" -> but K and E? But we need 5 letters? Wait, ""BIKE"" is 4 letters? Let me think of 5-letter words.\n\nPotential words:\n- ""PIQUE"": uses P, I, Q, U, E -> but Q and U are less common? And Q might be risky.\n- ""JUICE"": uses J, U, I, C, E -> but C is already known absent? (from guess1) -> we cannot use C.\n- ""DUNCE"": uses D, U, N, C, E -> but N and C are absent, so invalid.\n- ""GUIDE"": uses G, U, I, D, E -> all new letters? G, U, I, D are not in the absent list.\n- ""MIXED"": uses M, I, X, E, D -> ends with E? No, it ends with D. We need to end with E.\n- ""DIMES"": ends with S -> but S is absent? Cannot use S.\n\nWe need words ending with E and avoiding the absent letters.\n\nList some words:\n- ""GUIDE"": G, U, I, D, E -> checks: G, U, I, D are not in {C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L}. So valid.\n- ""QUIET"": ends with T? Not E.\n- ""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> but the first letter is B and last is E. But note: we have two E\'s? And the word is [B][E][I][G][E]? Actually, ""beige"" is 5 letters: B-E-I-G-E. But position 5 is E? Yes. But what about the E in position 2? We don\'t know if there\'s another E. Also, avoiding absent: B, E, I, G -> E is already known to be present, but we can reuse E? However, we know E is in position 5, but the word might have E somewhere else? And we can test that.\n\nBut note: the absent letters we have are C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L. So B, I, G are allowed? Wait, ""beige"" uses E twice? We can use repeated letters? Yes, but we must account for the possibility.\n\nBut ""beige"" might be a good candidate? However, we are trying to introduce new letters. We already know E is present at the end, so the E in position 2 is additional.\n\nHowever, we are allowed to guess words with repeated E? But let\'s see if we can form words with only new letters.\n\nAlternatively, consider ""BUMPY""? Doesn\'t end with E.\n\nAnother candidate: ""GIVEN"": but ends with N? Wait, and N is absent? So invalid.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""PRIDE"": but R is absent (from guess1) -> invalid.\n- ""BIKIE"": not standard? Or ""BIKE"" expanded? Not common.\n\nMore common words:\n- ""PIECE"": P, I, E, C, E -> but C is absent? Invalid.\n- ""QUEUE"": Q, U, E, U, E -> but we don\'t know about Q and U? And it has two U\'s. But the word ends with E? Yes. But Q and U are new? And we haven\'t tried them. Also, the absent letters? A, C, R, N, S, T, O, L are not including Q or U.\n  However, ""queue"" is a valid English word? Yes.\n\nBut ""QUEUE"" might be uncommon? Also, it only introduces Q and U? Because E we know.\n\nPerhaps ""GUIDE"" is better because it uses more common letters: G, U, I, D.\n\nAnother: ""PHASE"" -> but S and A are absent? Invalid.\n\n""WHILE"" -> L and E? But L is absent? From guess2: L is absent -> invalid.\n\n""MOVIE"" -> ends with E? Actually, ""movie"" is M-O-V-I-E -> 5 letters? Yes. But we cannot use O (absent) and M, V, I are new? So M, V, I, E. But O is absent? So invalid because O is absent.\n\n""ABIDE"" -> A is absent? Invalid.\n\nSo after some thought, let\'s try ""GUIDE"" as a candidate.\n\nBut wait, ""GUIDE"": G-U-I-D-E. The E is in the end, correct. We test G at position1, U at2, I at3, D at4.\n\nIf the secret word has G, U, I, or D, we will get feedback.\n\nAlternatively, consider ""BEIGE"": B-E-I-G-E -> tests B at1, E at2, I at3, G at4, E at5. Since E is already known to be at5, we are testing for another E at position2? But we know from guess1 that there is only one E? Actually, guess1 only showed one E (at the end). But if there is an E in position2, then in guess1 we didn\'t have E in position2, so we wouldn\'t have known.\n\nHowever, the feedback for ""crane"" didn\'t show any other E as being present but wrong position? Because if there was an E elsewhere, it would have been marked with \'-\'? But in ""crane"", we only had one E (at the end) and no other E in the guess? Actually, we guessed only one E.\n\nSo it\'s possible that there is an E in position2? The absence of evidence in the first guess doesn\'t prove there isn\'t another E.\n\nBut we are on the second guess? Wait, we\'ve only made two guesses.\n\nBut ""stole"" also didn\'t have any E at position2? Wait, we had E at the end only.\n\nSo we haven\'t tested E in any other position.\n\nTherefore, if we guess a word with E in position2, we might get a \'-\' if it is present but we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, to maximize letter coverage, we should try a word without E except at the end? Because we are limited to 5-letter words.\n\nGiven that we have 6 guesses, we can sacrifice a position to test the E duplication? But on the third guess, we can focus on letters.\n\nI think ""BEIGE"" is a good candidate? But it uses E twice? And the E in position2 is a test for duplication.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to reuse letters? The rules don\'t forbid it.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s look for a word that doesn\'t have E in any other position, so we test only new letters.\n\nFor example: ""PUDGE"" -> P-U-D-G-E -> all new letters except E at the end? That\'s good.\n\nIs ""PUDGE"" a word? It\'s slang? Or ""FUDGE""? F-U-D-G-E -> yes, ""fudge"" is a valid word.\n\n""FUDGE"": F-U-D-G-E -> uses F, U, D, G, E. \n- F is new, not in absent list? Absent: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L -> F is not in there.\n- U, D, G are also new.\n\nSo ""FUDGE"" would be a safe guess: we test F, U, D, G, and E (known).\n\nSimilarly, ""DODGE""? But O and D? O is absent? So invalid.\n\n""WEDGE"": W-E-D-G-E -> but E is in position2? Again, testing for an extra E? And we test W, D, G.\n\nBut ""fudge"" avoids any extra E.\n\nSo I think ""FUDGE"" is a better candidate than ""GUIDE"" because it uses common letters? F, U, D, G are all common enough.\n\nAnother word: ""MIDGE"" -> M-I-D-G-E -> M, I, D, G, E -> also valid.\n\nBut ""fudge"" versus ""midge""? Both are valid.\n\nWe choose one. Let\'s go with ""FUDGE"".\n\nBut we must confirm: all letters in ""FUDGE"" are not in the absent list: F, U, D, G are not in {C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L}.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, our next guess is ""FUDGE"".\n\nBut wait, we haven\'t tested the letter B? Or P? There are many letters left.\n\nWe have to make a choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""PURGE""? But U, R? But R is absent? So invalid.\n\n""INODE""? Not a word.\n\n""QUAKE""? But A is absent? Invalid.\n\n""JUICE""? J-U-I-C-E -> C is absent? Invalid.\n\nSo ""FUDGE"" seems good.\n\nAlso, words like ""BADGE"" are invalid because A is absent.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""FUDGE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane""):** E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th letter). C, R, A, N are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""stole""):** E is confirmed in position 5. S, T, O, L are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word ends with **E**.\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L (8 total).\n- The word must be of the form `[?][?][?][?]E`, avoiding the absent letters.\n- Remaining common letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Focus on introducing new high-frequency consonants and vowels not yet tested.\n- Avoid reusing absent letters and reuse E only in position 5.\n- Prioritize words that maximize coverage of new letters (e.g., F, U, D, G, H, M).\n- ""FUDGE"" is a strong candidate: \n  - Uses new letters: F, U, D, G (all untested).\n  - Ends with E (maintains known position).\n  - Tests 4 new letters in positions 1–4.\n\n<guess>fudge</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: fudge -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(-) D(x) G(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- E is correct and in position 5.\n- C, R, A, N are absent.\n\nGuess 2: ""stole"" -> S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- E is correct in position 5 (confirmed).\n- S, T, O, L are absent.\n\nGuess 3: ""fudge"" -> F(x) U(-) D(x) G(x) E(✓)\nMeaning:\n- U is present in the word but not in position 2.\n- E is correct in position 5.\n- F, D, G are absent.\n\nTherefore, the secret word:\n- Must end with E (position 5).\n- Contains the letter U, but not in position 2.\n- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, F, D, G.\n\nAdditionally, we know that U is in the word, but not in position 2.\n\nThe secret word has the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E\n\nConstraints on letters:\n- The word must include U (somewhere not position 2).\n- Exclude: A, C, D, F, G, L, N, O, R, S, T.\n\nAvailable letters (from common English letters): B, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, and U is already included? But U must be in the word, so we have to place it in one of positions 1, 3, or 4? But wait: the word must have U somewhere. Our guess must account for that.\n\nWe also have the feedback that U is in the word (wrong position) from guess 3.\n\nNow, we need to make a new guess that:\n- Is a valid 5-letter word ending in E (since we know position 5 is E).\n- Includes the letter U in a position other than 2? Actually, position 2 was wrong, but it could be in 1, 3, or 4? Actually, positions 1,3,4, or ...? The secret word has U somewhere in the first four positions, but not at index 2? Because we guessed U at position 2 and got \'-\', meaning it is present but not there. Therefore, U must be in position 1, 3, or 4? Wait: indices: 1,2,3,4,5. So U is in position 1, 3, or 4? Or possibly 5? But 5 is E, so U cannot be in position 5. Therefore, U must be in position 1, 3, or 4? No, wait: position 5 is E and fixed, so U must be in one of the first four positions. But not position 2 (from guess 3). Therefore, U is in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nOur guess should test which position U is in, while also testing new letters.\n\nBut note: we also have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nList of absent letters so far (from all feedback): \nC, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, F, D, G\n\nSo available letters: B, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, and U is already in the word? We must use U because we know it\'s present? Actually, we are trying to guess the word, so we can include U to figure out its position.\n\nWe must form a word with the available letters and having U in position 1, 3, or 4? And ending with E.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have to guess U again? We know U is present, so we can try to guess words that include U? But we can also guess words without U? However, we know U is in the secret word? So if we don\'t include U in a guess, we might not get information about its position? But since we know U is present, we should use our guess to pinpoint its position? Or test new letters?\n\nBut we don\'t know the position of U yet, so we should try to cover it? Actually, we have limited guesses (6 total, this is the fourth). So we should form a word that includes U and tests it in one of the possible positions, while introducing new letters.\n\nWe can also use multiple U\'s? But that might be tricky.\n\nLet\'s list words that end with E, include U, and avoid absent letters, and have U not in position 2? But since we know U is not in position 2, we can put U in position 1, 3, or 4? And then the other positions are new letters.\n\nFor example:\n- Position 1: U? Then word: U _ _ _ E\n  - Examples: ""USAGE"" -> but S and A are absent? Invalid.\n    ""URINE"" -> R absent? Invalid.\n    ""UTILE"" -> T and L absent? Invalid.\n    ""UMPIE""? Not a word.\n    ""UMPTE""? Not a word.\n\n  Possible: ""UPPER""? Doesn\'t end with E? ""UPPEE""? Not a word. ""UPTIE""? Not common.\n\n  How about ""UNWED""? But N and D absent? Invalid.\n\n  This is difficult.\n\n- Position 3: _ _ U _ E\n  - Examples: ""MUTED"" -> D absent? Invalid.\n    ""JUWEL""? Not standard.\n    ""HAUTE"" -> H-A-U-T-E -> but A and T absent? Invalid.\n    ""EQUIP""? Doesn\'t end with E? ""EQUIPE""? 6 letters? Not.\n\n  How about ""EQUIP"" -> 5 letters? But ends with P? No.\n\n  ""PIQUE"": P-I-Q-U-E -> this is a valid word? Yes. And P, I, Q are new? And U is in position 4? Actually, ""PIQUE"" is P-I-Q-U-E -> positions:1:P,2:I,3:Q,4:U,5:E? But our secret word ends with E (pos5), so yes.\n\n  But is Q available? Absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L,F,D,G -> Q is not in that list? So Q can be used? But we haven\'t tested Q? So yes.\n\n  ""PIQUE"": uses P, I, Q, U, E -> but U is in position 4? Which we haven\'t tested before? And this guess would test if U appears in position 4? And we test P, I, Q.\n\n- Position 4: _ _ _ U E? But then the word ends with ""UE""? Actually, that\'s common? Like ""ARGUE"", but A and R absent? Invalid.\n\n  ""VENUE"" -> V-E-N-U-E -> but N is absent? Invalid.\n  ""QUEUE"" -> Q-U-E-U-E -> ends with E? And U in position2 and position4? But we know U is not in position 2? Wait, in ""QUEUE"", if we guess it, then position4 is U? But then U at position2: we know it\'s not? Because in guess3 we had U at2 as \'-\' meaning wrong position? But now we are guessing U at position2 again? That\'s allowed? But we\'d get a \'-\' or \'x\'? Actually, the secret word could have U at position4? And if we guess U at position2 again, we might get \'x\'? Because if the secret word doesn\'t have a U at2, then this guess at2 would be wrong? But we know U is in the secret word? So if we guess U at a position where it\'s not, it would be \'-\'.\n\nBut let\'s not complicate: the position for U must be 1,3, or4? So guessing at position4 is valid?\n\nBut ""PIQUE"" places U at position4? So that\'s one candidate.\n\nAlternatively, place U at position1: what words are there? ""UNITE"" -> N and T absent? Invalid. ""UNDUE"" -> N and D absent? Invalid.\n\nPlace U at position3: ""BUXOM"" doesn\'t end with E? ""BUMPY"" not E? Words: ""BUCKET"" too long? ""MAUVE"" -> M-A-U-V-E -> A absent? Invalid. ""HAUGE""? Not standard? ""QUOTE"" -> O and T absent? Invalid. ""QUIFF"" not ending in E? ""MUTED"" -> D absent? Invalid. ""QUIRE"" -> R absent? Invalid. ""QUINE"" -> N present? Absent? N is absent? So invalid.\n\nSo ""PIQUE"" seems a valid option? But it uses Q? And it\'s uncommon? But acceptable.\n\nOther options: ""JUMBLE"" too long? Or ""JUMPS"" no E? ""VERVE"" ends with E? V-E-R-V-E -> R absent? Invalid.\n\n""QUITE"" -> Q-U-I-T-E -> but T is absent? Invalid.\n\n""PIXIE"" -> ends with E? P-I-X-I-E? But no U? And we need to include U? Because we know U is present? So if we don\'t include U, then we are risking? But we can guess without U? However, the feedback would tell us if U is in the word? But we already know U is present, so if we don\'t guess U, we won\'t get information on its position? We should include U to help track it? But we have positions 1,3,4 to test for U.\n\nSo we can try a word placing U at position1? For example: ""UBIETY"" too long? Not 5 letters. ""UGLIE"" -> but L and G absent? Invalid. Not possible?\n\nPlace U at position3: ""BAUDRY""? Not 5 letters? ""CAPUT"" no E? ""HYPED"" no U? This is difficult.\n\nAnother word with U at position4: ""PIQUE"" is one. ""JUNKY"" no E? ""BARQUE"" too long? ""QUEUE"" -> Q-U-E-U-E -> but U is at position2 and position4? But we know U is not at position2? So in ""QUEUE"", we are putting U at position2 and position4? But the secret word might have U at position4? Then in the feedback, U at position2 would be wrong (should be \'x\') because we know U isn\'t there? But we are guessing U at2 again? That\'s allowed? And we are testing U at position4? But it might yield \'-\'? Actually, if U is at4, then:\n\nGuess: QUEUE -> Q(?), U at2 (should be absent? But no: the secret has U only at4? So U at2 would be present but wrong position? But wait, we already have U at2 in guess3 and got \'-\' meaning present but wrong position? So if U is at4, then when we guess QUEUE:\n\n- Q at1: could be x or ✓? \n- U at2: present? But in the secret word there is a U at4? So U at2: not present? Because the secret word has U only at4? Actually, if the secret word has one U at4, then guessing U at2 would be \'-\' because the U is in the word but not at that position? Unless there is another U? But the secret word might have two U\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nBut the feedback would show \'-\' for U at any position that is not exactly the right one? And separately for each occurrence.\n\nSo if the secret word has only one U at position4, then:\n- If we guess U at2: \'-\' because it\'s in the word but wrong position? Then U at4: ✓? Because correct? And if we have two U\'s? Then we mark accordingly? But we don\'t know.\n\nTherefore, guessing ""QUEUE"" might yield:\n  Q(x) U(-) E(?) U(?) E(✓) -> but E in position3: we know position5 is E? But position3 E? Could be \'-\' if there\'s another E? But we don\'t know if there is another E.\n\nComplex? So let me avoid ""QUEUE"".\n\nSo perhaps ""PIQUE"" is a better choice? It puts U at position4? So we are testing U in position4? And Q at position3? Which is new.\n\nBut Q might be less common? And we haven\'t tried Q? We are introducing a rare letter? But possible.\n\nOther possibilities: \n  ""QUIFF"" -> doesn\'t end with E? ""GUAVA"" -> G absent? We cannot use G? G is absent? From guess3: G(x) meaning absent? So we cannot use G? And F,D,G absent.\n\nIn ""PIQUE"", we avoid absent letters: only P, I, Q, U? Are available? P, I, Q are not in the absent list: absent are C,R,A,N,S,T,O,L,F,D,G -> so P, I, Q are allowed? Yes.\n\nTherefore, ""PIQUE"" is valid? But does it end with E? P-I-Q-U-E -> positions:1=P,2=I,3=Q,4=U,5=E -> ends with E? Yes.\n\nSo we can guess ""PIQUE""?\n\nBut we are also testing new letters: P, I, Q? And U at a new position (4).\n\nAlternatively, consider a word with U at position3? Or position1? But struggling? So we\'ll go with ""PIQUE"".\n\nBut note: we have another possibility? What about ""MUNCH""? No E ending? ""VINEW"" not a word? ""BIJOU"" doesn\'t end with E? ""PIQUE"" seems the best.\n\nAnother word: ""JUDGE""? But D and G absent? Invalid.\n\nSo I think we should try ""PIQUE"".\n\nBut let\'s think: what if the U is not in position4? Then we will get a \'-\' for U? But we are putting U in position4? So if U is elsewhere, we\'ll know? And mark other positions? We are testing position4.\n\nMoreover, P and I are common? But I haven\'t been tested? So we\'ll get information about P and I? And Q? Which might not be? But even if Q is rare, we test it? And then if absent, we know that Q is not in the word? So we can eliminate.\n\nTherefore, we choose ""PIQUE"".We are given feedback for Guess 3 (""fudge""): U is present but not in position 2. This narrows down U\'s position to either 1, 3, or 4. \n\n### Constraints So Far:\n- **Absent letters:** A, C, D, F, G, L, N, O, R, S, T (11 letters).\n- **Present letters:** \n  - E (position 5 confirmed).\n  - U (present, not in position 2; must be in position 1, 3, or 4).\n- Remaining pool of common letters: B, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- Prioritize testing U\'s position (1, 3, or 4) while introducing new letters.\n- End with E (leverage confirmed position 5).\n- ""PIQUE"" (P-I-Q-U-E) fits:\n  - Tests U in position 4.\n  - Uses new high-frequency letters (P, I) and Q for exploration.\n  - Avoids all absent letters.\n  - Ends with E.\n\n<guess>pique</guess>.Based on previous feedback:\n- **E is confirmed in position 5**.\n- **U is present** but not in position 2 (must be in position 1, 3, or 4).\n- **Absent letters**: A, C, D, F, G, L, N, O, R, S, T.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Prioritize testing U in a new position (1, 3, or 4) while leveraging E in position 5.\n- Introduce new untested letters from the remaining pool (B, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y).\n- ""PIQUE"" (P-I-Q-U-E) fits:\n  - Places U in position 4 to test its location.\n  - Uses new common letters P and I, plus Q for exploration.\n  - Avoids all absent letters.\n  - Ends with E (maintains known position).\n\n<guess>pique</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: fudge -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(-) D(x) G(x) E(✓)\nGuess 4: pique -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(-) Q(x) U(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> E is correct and in position 5. C, R, A, N are absent.
Guess 2: ""stole"" -> E is correct in position 5. S, T, O, L are absent.
Guess 3: ""fudge"" -> E is correct in position 5. U is present but not in position 2. F, D, G are absent.
Guess 4: ""pique"" -> E is correct in position 5. U is correct in position 4. P is absent. I is present but not in position 2. Q is absent.

So, summarizing:

- Position 5: E (confirmed in all guesses)
- Position 4: U (confirmed in guess 4)
- I is present in the word, but not in position 2 (from guess 4: I at position 2 got '-', meaning present but wrong position)
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L, F, D, G, P, Q

Now, the secret word has the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3] U E

We know:
- The word ends with ""UE"" (positions 4 and 5: U and E)
- I is present, but not in position 2. So I must be in position 1 or 3? Because positions 4 and 5 are taken by U and E? So I can be in position 1 or 3? But we have only positions 1, 2, 3 to fill? Actually, the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know 4 and 5: U and E. So positions 1,2,3 are unknown? But we know I is present and not in position 2? So I must be in position 1 or 3? Or could it be in position 4? But position 4 is U? So no? Position 5 is E? So I must be in position 1 or 3? But we have three positions: 1,2,3? And I is in one of them? But not position 2? So position 1 or 3? Yes.

Therefore, the word is: [I?] [not I] [I?] U E

But note: I could be in position 1 or 3? And we don't know which? Or both? But we don't have information about duplicates? But we know I is present at least once? So we must have I in either position 1 or 3? Or both? But we don't know? But we can assume one for now? Actually, the feedback from guess4: we had I at position2 and got '-', meaning there is an I in the word but not at position2? So it must be at position1 or 3? Or even position3? But we have position4 and5 fixed? So only positions 1 and 3 are available for I? But position3 is the only other position? Actually, positions 1,2,3 are available? But I cannot be at position2? So it must be at position1 or 3? Yes.

Additionally, we have the absent letters: A, C, D, F, G, L, N, O, R, S, T, P, Q? So we cannot use these.

Available letters: B, H, I, J, K, M, V, W, X, Y? And we know I is present? So we must use I? But we are going to guess? So we can form a word that has I in position1 or position3? And the other positions with new letters? But we have to avoid the absent letters.

We also know that position2 must be a letter that is not I? And not in the absent list? And we don't know what it is? So we need to test.

Now, we have two cases: 
Case 1: I is in position1? Then the word is: I [letter2] [letter3] U E
Case 2: I is in position3? Then the word is: [letter1] [letter2] I U E

We need to choose a word that can test between these cases? Or we can try to cover both? But we have to make one guess.

We can try a word that has I in position1? Then if I is actually in position1, we get a ✓? If not, we get a '-'? Similarly, if we put I in position3? Then we get ✓ if it is there? Or '-' if it is in the other position? But we know I is present? So if we put I in position1 and it is actually in position3, we get a '-'? And if we put I in position3 and it is actually in position1, we get a '-'? So we can test.

But we also need to test the other letters? So we should choose a word that has I in one of the positions? And then the other positions with new letters? To get information.

Let's list possible words? But we don't know which case? So we can choose a word that fits one of the patterns? And then the feedback will tell us.

For example, if we assume I is in position1? Then we can try: I _ _ U E? But what words? With available letters? And avoiding absent.

Available letters: B, H, I, J, K, M, V, W, X, Y? But I is at position1? So the other letters: position2 and3: from B, H, J, K, M, V, W, X, Y? And we must form a valid word.

Words: 
  ""IMMUE""? Not a word? 
  ""IMPUE""? Not a word?
  ""INSUE""? But N and S absent? Invalid.
  ""INDEX""? D absent? Invalid.

Actually, it's hard? How about ""ISSUE""? But S absent? Invalid.

""IMAGE""? But A and G absent? Invalid.

""IVY""? Not 5 letters? ""IVORY""? Not 5? ""IVIED""? I-V-I-E-D -> but D absent? And we have two I's? But we don't know? And D is absent? So invalid.

""JIVED""? J-I-V-E-D -> D absent? Invalid.

""KIWIS""? No E? ""KIWIFRUIT"" too long? Not.

This is difficult? Maybe I in position1 is not common? 

Try I in position3? Then the word: _ _ I U E? 

Words: 
  ""ABIU""? Not 5? 
  ""BATIU""? Not a word? 
  ""BEVUE""? B-E-V-U-E -> but E is at position2? And we have E at position5? But we know E is at position5? But the secret word might have another E? But in this case, ""BEVUE"" has E at position2 and position5? But we are testing? But we have to avoid absent letters? B, E, V, U, E? But E is already known? But we are testing? And U is known? But we cannot use E in position2? Because we are guessing? But we can? The feedback will tell us? But we are trying to form a word? 

But ""BEVUE"" is a word? It means a mistake? But let's see: B-E-V-U-E? But we have to avoid absent? Absent: A,C,D,F,G,L,N,O,R,S,T,P,Q? So B, E, V are allowed? But we are using E at position2? And we know the secret word has E at position5? But it might have E at position2? We don't know? So we can try? But we are testing? 

But we are trying to find a word that fits the pattern? 

Another word: ""HAVING""? No E? ""HAVIOUR""? Too long? 

""MAQUIS""? Not ending with UE? 

""QUIET""? But Q absent? And T absent? Invalid? 

""VIVID""? No E? 

""WIVED""? W-I-V-E-D -> D absent? Invalid? 

""YIVIS""? Not a word? 

""BIKIE""? Not standard? 

""MINIM""? No E? 

""JIHAD""? No E? 

This is challenging? 

Another idea: we know the word ends with ""UE"", so common words? Like ""ARGUE"", but A and R absent? ""ISSUE"", S absent? ""VALUE"", A absent? ""PIQUE"", we already tried? ""QUEUE"", we considered? But Q absent? 

""HAVUE""? Not a word? 

""BEVUE"" is a word? Let me confirm: yes, ""bevue"" is a rare word meaning a blunder? 

But we can use it? But we have to avoid absent? B, E, V, U, E? Absent letters: we have A,C,D,F,G,L,N,O,R,S,T,P,Q? So B, E, V are not in that list? So we can use? 

But we are testing I? But ""bevue"" doesn't have I? But we know I is present? So if we guess ""bevue"", we are not including I? Then the feedback for I? We won't get any? But we know I is present? So if we don't include I, then the feedback will show that I is still present? But we already know? We are trying to find the position? 

But if we guess a word without I, then we get no information about I's position? And we might get information about other letters? But we have to include I? Because we are required to guess a word? But we can guess any word? But to be efficient, we should include I? 

But we are not forced to include I? But if we don't, we won't know where I is? And we have only two guesses left? (this is the fifth guess? We have 6 total? So two left after this? But we are on the fifth? We have made 4, so this is the fifth? Then we have one more? 

But let's see: we have to guess a word that includes I? Because we know I is present? So we should include I to test its position? 

Therefore, we cannot guess ""bevue"" because it doesn't have I? 

So we must include I? 

Now, back to the patterns? 

Pattern 1: I at position1: I _ _ U E? With the middle two letters from available? 

Available: B, H, J, K, M, V, W, X, Y? 

Words: 
  ""IMBUE"" -> I-M-B-U-E? But B and M? Are they allowed? Yes, not in absent? But we have to check: I at1, M at2, B at3, U at4, E at5? 

Is ""IMBUE"" a word? Yes, meaning to inspire or permeate? 

And it uses I at position1? Which is one of the possibilities? 

Pattern 2: I at position3: _ _ I U E? 

For example, ""  I U E"" with first two letters? 

But we have ""IMBUE"" which is I at1? So we can try that? 

But what if I is actually in position3? Then in ""IMBUE"", I at1 would be present but wrong position? And we would get a '-' for I? And then we know I is not at1? So it must be at3? And we also test M and B? 

If I is at1, then we get I(✓) and then we know? 

So ""IMBUE"" seems a good candidate? 

Also, it ends with UE? And we know U and E are at4 and5? 

So let's go with ""IMBUE"". 

But we must check absent letters: I, M, B, U, E? 
- I: we are using? 
- M: not in absent list? 
- B: not in absent list? 
- U: we know is present? 
- E: we know is present? 

Absent list: A,C,D,F,G,L,N,O,R,S,T,P,Q? So M and B are allowed? 

Yes. 

Therefore, we guess ""IMBUE"". 

But note: in ""IMBUE"", we have U at4? Which we know is correct? And E at5 correct? So we are testing positions 1,2,3? 

If the secret word has I at1, then we get I(✓) and then M and B to test? 

If the secret word has I at3, then we get I at1 as '-'? And then we know I is at3? And then M and B? 

So we get information. 

We could also consider other words? Like ""IVIED""? But D absent? ""IKONS""? No E? 

""IMBUE"" seems good. 

Another word: ""INURE""? But N absent? Invalid? 

So we choose ""IMBUE"".

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Known Information**:
   - **Position 5**: E is confirmed (from all guesses).
   - **Position 4**: U is confirmed (from Guess 4: ""pique"" → U(✓)).
   - **I is present** but not in position 2 (from Guess 4: I(-) at position 2).
   - **Absent letters**: A, C, D, F, G, L, N, O, R, S, T, P, Q (eliminated from feedback).
   - **Remaining letters**: B, H, I, J, K, M, V, W, X, Y.
   - **Word structure**: `[?] [?] [?] U E` (positions 1–3 unknown, positions 4–5 fixed as U and E).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - I must be in position 1 or 3 (since it’s present but not in position 2, and positions 4–5 are fixed).
   - We need to test I’s position while covering new letters (B, H, M, V, W, etc.).

3. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - **Test I in position 1**: If correct, we lock position 1. If not, I must be in position 3.
   - Use a word ending with ""UE"" to maintain known positions 4–5.
   - Introduce new high-frequency letters (e.g., B, M) to maximize information.
   - **Optimal word: ""IMBUE""**:
     - I in position 1 (tests if I is here).
     - M and B in positions 2–3 (new letters).
     - U and E in positions 4–5 (confirmed, so feedback focuses on positions 1–3).

4. **Why ""IMBUE""?**:
   - If I is in position 1 → I(✓), confirming the structure `I [?] [?] U E`.
   - If I is in position 3 → I(-) at position 1, confirming I must be in position 3 (`[?] [?] I U E`).
   - M and B test for presence/position in the remaining slots.
   - Avoids all absent letters.

So position 1 or 3? Yes.

Therefore, the word is: [I?] [not I] [I?] U E

   - **I is present** but not in position 2 (from Guess 4: I(-) at position 2).
   - **Absent letters**: A, C, D, F, G, L, N, O, R, S, T, P, Q (eliminated from feedback).
   - **Remaining letters**: B, H, I, J, K, M, V, W, X, Y.
   - **Word structure**: `[?] [?] [?] U E` (positions 1–3 unknown, positions 4–5 fixed as U and E).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - I must be in position 1 or 3 (since it’s present but not in position 2, and positions 4–5 are fixed).
   - We need to test I’s position while covering new letters (B, H, M, V, W, etc.).

3. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - **Test I in position 1**: If correct, we lock position 1. If not, I must be in position 3.
   - Use a word ending with ""UE"" to maintain known positions 4–5.
   - Introduce new high-frequency letters (e.g., B, M) to maximize information.
   - **Optimal word: ""IMBUE""**:
     - I in position 1 (tests if I is here).
     - M and B in positions 2–3 (new letters).
     - U and E in positions 4–5 (confirmed, so feedback focuses on positions 1–3).

4. **Why ""IMBUE""?**:
   - If I is in position 1 → I(✓), confirming the structure `I [?] [?] U E`.
   - If I is in position 3 → I(-) at position 1, confirming I must be in position 3 (`[?] [?] I U E`).
   - M and B test for presence/position in the remaining slots.
   - Avoids all absent letters.",Guess 5: imbue -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) M(✓) B(✓) U(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
