We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are on the second guess. The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" was: 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: ✓ (correct letter and position)
 E: ✓ (correct letter and position)

 That means:
 - The secret word has N in the fourth position and E in the fifth position.
 - The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ N E

 We also know that the word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N and E are fixed in their positions, we need to guess the first three letters.

 For the next guess, we want to use a word that:
   - Ends with ""NE"" (because N in 4th and E in 5th are fixed)
   - Does not use the letters C, R, A (since they are not in the word)
   - Uses other common letters to gain more information.

 We know the positions of N and E, so let's think of words that match the pattern _ _ _ N E.

 We have two positions to fill: first, second, and third.

 We should avoid using C, R, A, but we can use other common letters like T, S, L, O, U, etc.

 Let me think of words ending in NE and not containing C, R, A.

 Some possibilities:
   - shine: S H I N E -> but we have to check if S, H, I are allowed? (we haven't eliminated them)
   - phone: P H O N E -> but O might be in the word? We don't know.
   - scene: but C is already eliminated -> not allowed.
   - stone: S T O N E -> but O might be? Also, we can check.

 However, note that we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize the chance of hitting the word and also get information.

 Another approach: we can try to use letters that we haven't tried yet to get information on more letters.

 The letters we have tried so far: C, R, A, N, E -> we know N and E are in and in the correct positions, and C,R,A are out.

 So letters that are not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can choose a word that has three new letters and ends with NE.

 Let's consider:

   - LINE: L I N E -> but this uses N and E again, and L and I are new?
     Pattern: L I _ _ _ -> but our pattern is _ _ _ N E, so LINE has N in the 3rd position? Actually:
        LINE: positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E -> but we need N in the 4th and E in the 5th? 
        So we cannot use LINE because it doesn't fit the pattern (it only has 4 letters? Actually, LINE is 4 letters? No, wait: L-I-N-E -> 4 letters? 
        Actually, we need 5 letters: _ _ _ N E, so the word must be 5 letters ending with ""NE"".

     The pattern is: first letter unknown, second letter unknown, third letter unknown, fourth letter N, fifth letter E.

     So the word is: [1] [2] [3] N E

 Therefore, words like ""shine"", ""phone"", ""stone"", ""alone"", etc.

 But note: 
   ""shine"": S H I N E -> [1] S, [2] H, [3] I -> then we get feedback on S, H, I.

   ""phone"": P H O N E -> [1] P, [2] H, [3] O -> but note ""phone"" is 5 letters: P-H-O-N-E.

   ""stone"": S T O N E.

   ""alone"": but we can't use A (since A is eliminated) -> so avoid A.

   ""tune"": too short? T-U-N-E -> 4 letters? No, we need 5 letters.

   ""plane"": P-L-A-N-E -> but A is eliminated -> not allowed.

   ""prone"": P R O N E -> R is eliminated -> not allowed.

   ""spine"": S P I N E -> but we are replacing the third letter? 

 Let's think: we want to test letters that are likely to appear. Also, we can avoid letters we've eliminated.

 We have eliminated: C, R, A.

 So let's try ""shine"": 
   Positions: [1] S, [2] H, [3] I, [4] N (which we know is fixed and correct), [5] E (fixed and correct).

   If the secret is, say, ""shine"", then we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on S, H, I.

 But let's see another option: 

   ""phone"": P, H, O, N, E. 

   We haven't tried P, H, O.

   ""stone"": S, T, O, N, E.

   ""done"": D O N E -> wait, D-O-N-E -> 4 letters? Actually, 5 letter word: DONE is 4 letters? 
        Actually, D-O-N-E is 4 letters. We must have a word of 5 letters.

   ""tune"" is 4 letters, so we need 5-letter words.

   So words: 
     shine (5 letters: S, H, I, N, E)
     phone (5 letters: P, H, O, N, E)
     stone (5 letters: S, T, O, N, E)
     shone (5 letters: S, H, O, N, E) -> same as phone but with S instead of P.

   Another: ""binge"": B I N G E -> but fourth letter is G? We need N at 4th: B-I-N-G-E -> then G is at 4th? No: 
        B at 1, I at 2, N at 3 -> doesn't have N at the 4th? So that's not matching.

   We need a word of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3]NE.

   So let's choose ""shone"" (a valid word) or ""shine"".

   But what about ""spine"": S P I N E -> but that has N at the 4th? S-P-I-N-E: 
        Position 1: S, 2: P, 3: I, 4: N, 5: E -> yes.

   Similarly, ""swine"": S W I N E.

   However, we also want to test letters that are common. 

   Let me check: 
      We don't know about S, T, P, O, etc.

   I think ""stone"" is a good candidate because it has T and O which are common.

   Also, note that we have E and N fixed, so the word must end with NE. 

   Let's consider ""thine"": T H I N E -> but ""thine"" is an old English word? Might not be common.

   But we are playing a word game and the word must be valid.

   Let me go with ""stone"": S T O N E.

   Why? 
     - It uses S, T, O which are common letters we haven't tried.
     - It fits the pattern: S at pos1, T at pos2, O at pos3, then N at pos4, E at pos5.

   Now, we avoid the eliminated letters (C,R,A) so it's safe.

   Therefore, I will guess ""stone"".

   But note: the feedback might tell us about S, T, O.

   Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried and doesn't reuse any (even though N and E are fixed and we know we have to include them).

   However, including N and E again doesn't waste anything because we know they must be there and we are using the pattern.

   So I choose ""stone"".

   Guess: stone

   Pattern: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E.

   We'll see the feedback for S, T, O and whether they are in the word and in the correct positions or not.

   If the secret word is, for example, ""phone"", then the feedback for stone would be:
        S: not in the word -> x
        T: not in the word -> x
        O: in the word but not in the correct position? Actually, in ""phone"", O is in the 3rd position so it would be correct? 
        But wait, we are comparing:

        Secret: phone -> letters: P H O N E
        Guess: stone -> S T O N E

        Comparing:
          Position 1: S vs P -> not same -> but O is in the secret? 
          Position 2: T vs H -> not same -> no match
          Position 3: O vs O -> match -> so ✓
          Position 4: N vs N -> ✓
          Position 5: E vs E -> ✓

        And for the letters: 
          S: is it in phone? No -> x
          T: in phone? No -> x
          O: in phone? Yes, and in the correct position -> ✓
          N: ✓ and E: ✓.

        So feedback: S(x) T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)

   But that's just one example.

   Actually, we don't know the secret yet.

   So, without knowing, we try ""stone"".

   Alternatively, we might also consider ""shine"" (for testing I and H) or ""phone"" (for P and H) but we can choose.

   I'll go with ""stone"".

For the next guess, I need to:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess. The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" was: 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: ✓ (correct letter and position)
 E: ✓ (correct letter and position)

 That means:
 - The secret word has N in the fourth position and E in the fifth position.
 - The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ N E

 We also know that the word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N and E are fixed in their positions, we need to guess the first three letters.

 For the next guess, we want to use a word that:
   - Ends with ""NE"" (because N in 4th and E in 5th are fixed)
   - Does not use the letters C, R, A (since they are not in the word)
   - Uses other common letters to gain more information.

 We know the positions of N and E, so let's think of words that match the pattern _ _ _ N E.

 We have two positions to fill: first, second, and third.

 We should avoid using C, R, A, but we can use other common letters like T, S, L, O, U, etc.

 Let me think of words ending in NE and not containing C, R, A.

 Some possibilities:
   - shine: S H I N E -> but we have to check if S, H, I are allowed? (we haven't eliminated them)
   - phone: P H O N E -> but O might be in the word? We don't know.
   - scene: but C is already eliminated -> not allowed.
   - stone: S T O N E -> but O might be? Also, we can check.

 However, note that we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize the chance of hitting the word and also get information.

 Another approach: we can try to use letters that we haven't tried yet to get information on more letters.

 The letters we have tried so far: C, R, A, N, E -> we know N and E are in and in the correct positions, and C,R,A are out.

 So letters that are not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can choose a word that has three new letters and ends with NE.

 Let's consider:

   - LINE: L I N E -> but this uses N and E again, and L and I are new?
     Pattern: L I _ _ _ -> but our pattern is _ _ _ N E, so LINE has N in the 3rd position? Actually:
        LINE: positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E -> but we need N in the 4th and E in the 5th? 
        So we cannot use LINE because it doesn't fit the pattern (it only has 4 letters? Actually, LINE is 4 letters? No, wait: L-I-N-E -> 4 letters? 
        Actually, we need 5 letters: _ _ _ N E, so the word must be 5 letters ending with ""NE"".

     The pattern is: first letter unknown, second letter unknown, third letter unknown, fourth letter N, fifth letter E.

     So the word is: [1] [2] [3] N E

 Therefore, words like ""shine"", ""phone"", ""stone"", ""alone"", etc.

 But note: 
   ""shine"": S H I N E -> [1] S, [2] H, [3] I -> then we get feedback on S, H, I.

   ""phone"": P H O N E -> [1] P, [2] H, [3] O -> but note ""phone"" is 5 letters: P-H-O-N-E.

   ""stone"": S T O N E.

   ""alone"": but we can't use A (since A is eliminated) -> so avoid A.

   ""tune"": too short? T-U-N-E -> 4 letters? No, we need 5 letters.

   ""plane"": P-L-A-N-E -> but A is eliminated -> not allowed.

   ""prone"": P R O N E -> R is eliminated -> not allowed.

   ""spine"": S P I N E -> but we are replacing the third letter? 

 Let's think: we want to test letters that are likely to appear. Also, we can avoid letters we've eliminated.

 We have eliminated: C, R, A.

 So let's try ""shine"": 
   Positions: [1] S, [2] H, [3] I, [4] N (which we know is fixed and correct), [5] E (fixed and correct).

   If the secret is, say, ""shine"", then we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on S, H, I.

 But let's see another option: 

   ""phone"": P, H, O, N, E. 

   We haven't tried P, H, O.

   ""stone"": S, T, O, N, E.

   ""done"": D O N E -> wait, D-O-N-E -> 4 letters? Actually, 5 letter word: DONE is 4 letters? 
        Actually, D-O-N-E is 4 letters. We must have a word of 5 letters.

   ""tune"" is 4 letters, so we need 5-letter words.

   So words: 
     shine (5 letters: S, H, I, N, E)
     phone (5 letters: P, H, O, N, E)
     stone (5 letters: S, T, O, N, E)
     shone (5 letters: S, H, O, N, E) -> same as phone but with S instead of P.

   Another: ""binge"": B I N G E -> but fourth letter is G? We need N at 4th: B-I-N-G-E -> then G is at 4th? No: 
        B at 1, I at 2, N at 3 -> doesn't have N at the 4th? So that's not matching.

   We need a word of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3]NE.

   So let's choose ""shone"" (a valid word) or ""shine"".

   But what about ""spine"": S P I N E -> but that has N at the 4th? S-P-I-N-E: 
        Position 1: S, 2: P, 3: I, 4: N, 5: E -> yes.

   Similarly, ""swine"": S W I N E.

   However, we also want to test letters that are common. 

   Let me check: 
      We don't know about S, T, P, O, etc.

   I think ""stone"" is a good candidate because it has T and O which are common.

   Also, note that we have E and N fixed, so the word must end with NE. 

   Let's consider ""thine"": T H I N E -> but ""thine"" is an old English word? Might not be common.

   But we are playing a word game and the word must be valid.

   Let me go with ""stone"": S T O N E.

   Why? 
     - It uses S, T, O which are common letters we haven't tried.
     - It fits the pattern: S at pos1, T at pos2, O at pos3, then N at pos4, E at pos5.

   Now, we avoid the eliminated letters (C,R,A) so it's safe.

   Therefore, I will guess ""stone"".

   But note: the feedback might tell us about S, T, O.

   Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried and doesn't reuse any (even though N and E are fixed and we know we have to include them).

   However, including N and E again doesn't waste anything because we know they must be there and we are using the pattern.

   So I choose ""stone"".

   Guess: stone

   Pattern: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E.

   We'll see the feedback for S, T, O and whether they are in the word and in the correct positions or not.

   If the secret word is, for example, ""phone"", then the feedback for stone would be:
        S: not in the word -> x
        T: not in the word -> x
        O: in the word but not in the correct position? Actually, in ""phone"", O is in the 3rd position so it would be correct? 
        But wait, we are comparing:

        Secret: phone -> letters: P H O N E
        Guess: stone -> S T O N E

        Comparing:
          Position 1: S vs P -> not same -> but O is in the secret? 
          Position 2: T vs H -> not same -> no match
          Position 3: O vs O -> match -> so ✓
          Position 4: N vs N -> ✓
          Position 5: E vs E -> ✓

        And for the letters: 
          S: is it in phone? No -> x
          T: in phone? No -> x
          O: in phone? Yes, and in the correct position -> ✓
          N: ✓ and E: ✓.

        So feedback: S(x) T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)

   But that's just one example.

   Actually, we don't know the secret yet.

   So, without knowing, we try ""stone"".

   Alternatively, we might also consider ""shine"" (for testing I and H) or ""phone"" (for P and H) but we can choose.

   I'll go with ""stone"".

<guess>stone</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know:
- The 4th letter is N (correct position)
- The 5th letter is E (correct position)
- Letters C, R, and A are absent from the secret word

The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ N E  

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Keep N in the 4th position and E in the 5th position  
2. Avoid C, R, A  
3. Test new common letters to maximize information  

Good candidate words ending in ""NE"" and excluding C/R/A:  
- **stone**: Tests S, T, O (common letters)  
- Other options considered: ""phone"" (tests P, H, O), ""shine"" (tests S, H, I)  

Selected **""stone""** because it uses high-frequency consonants (S, T) and explores diverse letters. This tests:  
- Positions 1-3: S, T, O  
- While preserving confirmed letters N/E in positions 4-5

We are on the third guess. The feedback so far:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: ""stone"" -> S(x) T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)

From this, we know:
- The secret word has N in the 4th position and E in the 5th position. So the pattern is: _ _ _ N E
- The letters C, R, A, S, T are NOT in the word (since they are marked as absent).
- The letter O is in the word, but from the feedback of ""stone"", O is marked as correct (✓) in the third position? 
  Let's check: 
    In ""stone"", the O is in the third position and it is marked as ✓. That means in the secret word, O is in the third position? 
  But wait, the feedback for ""stone"" is: S(x) T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓). 
  This indicates:
    - S is absent (x)
    - T is absent (x)
    - O is present and in the correct position (third) -> so the third letter of the secret word is O.
    - N and E are in the correct positions (fourth and fifth).

Therefore, we now know that the secret word has the pattern: _ _ O N E

And we know that the first two letters are not C, R, A, S, T (and also not O because O is already placed, but we know it's in the third position).

So the secret word is: [letter1] [letter2] O N E

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, S, T.

We have to choose a word that fits the pattern _ _ O N E and uses letters that are not eliminated.

We have eliminated: C, R, A, S, T.

We have confirmed: O (in position 3), N (4), E (5).

We need to guess the first two letters.

We should use new letters to test for the first two positions.

Available letters: we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to choose a word that has the form [new1] [new2] O N E.

We can try to use common letters for the first two positions.

Possible words that end with ""ONE"" and are 5 letters? Actually, the pattern is _ _ O N E, which is the same as ending with ""ONE"" but note that the O is fixed at the third position? 

Wait, the pattern is: 
  position1: unknown
  position2: unknown
  position3: O
  position4: N
  position5: E

So the word ends with ""ONE"", but the ""O"" is the third letter? Actually, the last three letters are ""O N E"", so the word ends with ""ONE"" but the O is the third from the end? 

But in terms of common words, we can think of words like:
  - phone: P H O N E -> but we have eliminated S and T, but P and H are available? 
    However, in ""phone"", the O is the third letter? Let's see: 
        P (1), H (2), O (3), N (4), E (5) -> yes, that matches the pattern.

But we have to check if P and H are allowed? We haven't eliminated them. Also, we haven't used them.

But wait, in our pattern, the first two letters are unknown, so ""phone"" would be a candidate? But we are not guessing the secret, we are trying to get information.

However, if we guess ""phone"", we are testing P and H in the first two positions.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we have 3 known positions. We might want to guess a word that could be the solution if we are lucky.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses two new letters and fits the pattern.

Let me list some words that fit _ _ O N E:

  - phone: P H O N E
  - shone: S H O N E -> but S is eliminated, so not allowed.
  - stone: S T O N E -> but S and T are eliminated, and we already tried it.
  - alone: A L O N E -> but A is eliminated.
  - bone: too short? B O N E -> 4 letters? We need 5 letters.
  - cone: C O N E -> 4 letters? and C is eliminated.
  - done: D O N E -> 4 letters? 
  - gone: G O N E -> 4 letters?
  - hone: H O N E -> 4 letters?
  - lone: L O N E -> 4 letters?
  - none: N O N E -> but that has two N's? and pattern: N O N E -> 4 letters? 
  - pone: P O N E -> 4 letters? 
  - tone: T O N E -> 4 letters? and T is eliminated.

So 5-letter words? 

  - phone: P H O N E -> valid.
  - crone: C R O N E -> but C and R are eliminated.
  - drone: D R O N E -> R is eliminated.
  - prone: P R O N E -> R is eliminated.
  - shone: S H O N E -> S is eliminated.
  - phone is one.

Another: ""ozone"": O Z O N E -> but that has two O's? and the pattern requires O at the third position. 
    O at first? O Z O N E: 
        position1: O -> but we don't know if O is allowed elsewhere? but we have O fixed at third. 
        However, the feedback for O in ""stone"" was only for the third position. 
        But the secret word might have another O? 
        But in ""ozone"", the first letter is O and the third is O. 
        But we don't know if the secret word has two O's? 
        However, the pattern we have is _ _ O N E, so the first two letters are unknown, and the third is O. 
        ""ozone"" would be: O Z O N E -> 
            position1: O -> but we don't have O in the first position? 
            position2: Z
            position3: O -> which matches
            position4: N -> matches
            position5: E -> matches
        But we have an extra O at the beginning? 

        However, we don't know if the secret word has an O at the beginning? 

        But note: we have eliminated S, T, etc., but O is already in the word (at third position) so it can appear again? 
        The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, it might be marked accordingly.

        But in our feedback for ""stone"", we had O marked as correct in the third position, but that doesn't tell us if there is another O. 

        However, we are not sure. 

        But ""ozone"" is a valid word? Yes.

        But we are trying to guess, and we want to test the first two positions.

        Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates to get clearer feedback? 

        Since we are not sure, and we have limited guesses, we might avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

        So ""phone"" is better because it has unique letters: P, H, O, N, E.

        Also, ""phone"" uses two new letters: P and H.

        Another word: ""phone"" is a common word.

        What about ""phone"": 
            If we guess ""phone"", and the secret is ""phone"", we win.
            Otherwise, we get feedback on P and H.

        But note: the pattern is fixed for the last three: O, N, E.

        So the only unknowns are the first two.

        We can also consider ""clone"": but C is eliminated.

        ""prone"": R is eliminated.

        ""thone"": not a common word? 

        ""phone"" seems a good candidate.

        But wait, we have to make sure we don't use eliminated letters. We have eliminated: C, R, A, S, T.

        P and H are not eliminated, so ""phone"" is allowed.

        Another word: ""phone"" is 5 letters and fits the pattern.

        So I will guess ""phone"".

        But let me check if there are other possibilities? 

        ""moone"": not a word? 

        ""boone"": as in Daniel Boone? but it's a proper noun? Not sure if it's allowed.

        ""goone"": not a word.

        ""hoone"": not a word.

        ""loone"": not a word.

        ""poone"": not a word.

        ""woone"": not a word.

        So ""phone"" is a good choice.

        Alternatively, ""phone"" might be the word? 

        But we don't know.

        So I'll go with ""phone"".

        Guess: phone

        Pattern: P H O N E

        We'll see if P and H are in the word and in the correct positions.

        If the secret word is, for example, ""phone"", then we get all correct.

        If not, we get feedback on P and H.

        But note: the feedback for O, N, E will be correct again.

        So the feedback will be: P(?) H(?) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)

        And we'll know about P and H.

        Since we have only two positions to guess, and we have many letters left, we can then make another guess.

        But we have 4 guesses left? (since we used 2, so 4 left).

        So it's acceptable.

        Therefore, I choose ""phone"".

        <guess>phone</guess>
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
  - N (4th position) and E (5th position) are **correct**.  
  - C, R, A are **absent** from the secret word.  
- **Guess 2 (""stone"")**:  
  - O (3rd position), N (4th), and E (5th) are **correct**.  
  - S and T are **absent**.  

### Inferred Information:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ O N E` (3rd letter is O, 4th is N, 5th is E).  
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T (cannot appear anywhere).  
3. **Unknown positions**: 1st and 2nd letters.  
4. **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need a 5-letter word fitting `_ _ O N E` that **excludes C, R, A, S, T**.  
- Prioritize **high-frequency consonants** (e.g., H, P, L, M) to test the first two positions.  
- Ideal candidates: Words like **""phone""** (tests P and H) or **""clone""** (but C is invalid).  
- **""phone"" is optimal**: Uses new letters (P, H), fits the pattern, and is a common word.  

### Why ""phone""?
- Tests P in 1st position and H in 2nd position.  
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on P/H narrows possibilities (e.g., if P is correct, H is absent, etc.).  
- Avoids eliminated letters and leverages known pattern.  

<guess>phone</guess>",phone,"We are on the third guess. The feedback so far:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: ""stone"" -> S(x) T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)

From this, we know:
- The secret word has N in the 4th position and E in the 5th position. So the pattern is: _ _ _ N E
- The letters C, R, A, S, T are NOT in the word (since they are marked as absent).
- The letter O is in the word, but from the feedback of ""stone"", O is marked as correct (✓) in the third position? 
  Let's check: 
    In ""stone"", the O is in the third position and it is marked as ✓. That means in the secret word, O is in the third position? 
  But wait, the feedback for ""stone"" is: S(x) T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓). 
  This indicates:
    - S is absent (x)
    - T is absent (x)
    - O is present and in the correct position (third) -> so the third letter of the secret word is O.
    - N and E are in the correct positions (fourth and fifth).

Therefore, we now know that the secret word has the pattern: _ _ O N E

And we know that the first two letters are not C, R, A, S, T (and also not O because O is already placed, but we know it's in the third position).

So the secret word is: [letter1] [letter2] O N E

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, S, T.

We have to choose a word that fits the pattern _ _ O N E and uses letters that are not eliminated.

We have eliminated: C, R, A, S, T.

We have confirmed: O (in position 3), N (4), E (5).

We need to guess the first two letters.

We should use new letters to test for the first two positions.

Available letters: we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to choose a word that has the form [new1] [new2] O N E.

We can try to use common letters for the first two positions.

Possible words that end with ""ONE"" and are 5 letters? Actually, the pattern is _ _ O N E, which is the same as ending with ""ONE"" but note that the O is fixed at the third position? 

Wait, the pattern is: 
  position1: unknown
  position2: unknown
  position3: O
  position4: N
  position5: E

So the word ends with ""ONE"", but the ""O"" is the third letter? Actually, the last three letters are ""O N E"", so the word ends with ""ONE"" but the O is the third from the end? 

But in terms of common words, we can think of words like:
  - phone: P H O N E -> but we have eliminated S and T, but P and H are available? 
    However, in ""phone"", the O is the third letter? Let's see: 
        P (1), H (2), O (3), N (4), E (5) -> yes, that matches the pattern.

But we have to check if P and H are allowed? We haven't eliminated them. Also, we haven't used them.

But wait, in our pattern, the first two letters are unknown, so ""phone"" would be a candidate? But we are not guessing the secret, we are trying to get information.

However, if we guess ""phone"", we are testing P and H in the first two positions.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we have 3 known positions. We might want to guess a word that could be the solution if we are lucky.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses two new letters and fits the pattern.

Let me list some words that fit _ _ O N E:

  - phone: P H O N E
  - shone: S H O N E -> but S is eliminated, so not allowed.
  - stone: S T O N E -> but S and T are eliminated, and we already tried it.
  - alone: A L O N E -> but A is eliminated.
  - bone: too short? B O N E -> 4 letters? We need 5 letters.
  - cone: C O N E -> 4 letters? and C is eliminated.
  - done: D O N E -> 4 letters? 
  - gone: G O N E -> 4 letters?
  - hone: H O N E -> 4 letters?
  - lone: L O N E -> 4 letters?
  - none: N O N E -> but that has two N's? and pattern: N O N E -> 4 letters? 
  - pone: P O N E -> 4 letters? 
  - tone: T O N E -> 4 letters? and T is eliminated.

So 5-letter words? 

  - phone: P H O N E -> valid.
  - crone: C R O N E -> but C and R are eliminated.
  - drone: D R O N E -> R is eliminated.
  - prone: P R O N E -> R is eliminated.
  - shone: S H O N E -> S is eliminated.
  - phone is one.

Another: ""ozone"": O Z O N E -> but that has two O's? and the pattern requires O at the third position. 
    O at first? O Z O N E: 
        position1: O -> but we don't know if O is allowed elsewhere? but we have O fixed at third. 
        However, the feedback for O in ""stone"" was only for the third position. 
        But the secret word might have another O? 
        But in ""ozone"", the first letter is O and the third is O. 
        But we don't know if the secret word has two O's? 
        However, the pattern we have is _ _ O N E, so the first two letters are unknown, and the third is O. 
        ""ozone"" would be: O Z O N E -> 
            position1: O -> but we don't have O in the first position? 
            position2: Z
            position3: O -> which matches
            position4: N -> matches
            position5: E -> matches
        But we have an extra O at the beginning? 

        However, we don't know if the secret word has an O at the beginning? 

        But note: we have eliminated S, T, etc., but O is already in the word (at third position) so it can appear again? 
        The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, it might be marked accordingly.

        But in our feedback for ""stone"", we had O marked as correct in the third position, but that doesn't tell us if there is another O. 

        However, we are not sure. 

        But ""ozone"" is a valid word? Yes.

        But we are trying to guess, and we want to test the first two positions.

        Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates to get clearer feedback? 

        Since we are not sure, and we have limited guesses, we might avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

        So ""phone"" is better because it has unique letters: P, H, O, N, E.

        Also, ""phone"" uses two new letters: P and H.

        Another word: ""phone"" is a common word.

        What about ""phone"": 
            If we guess ""phone"", and the secret is ""phone"", we win.
            Otherwise, we get feedback on P and H.

        But note: the pattern is fixed for the last three: O, N, E.

        So the only unknowns are the first two.

        We can also consider ""clone"": but C is eliminated.

        ""prone"": R is eliminated.

        ""thone"": not a common word? 

        ""phone"" seems a good candidate.

        But wait, we have to make sure we don't use eliminated letters. We have eliminated: C, R, A, S, T.

        P and H are not eliminated, so ""phone"" is allowed.

        Another word: ""phone"" is 5 letters and fits the pattern.

        So I will guess ""phone"".

        But let me check if there are other possibilities? 

        ""moone"": not a word? 

        ""boone"": as in Daniel Boone? but it's a proper noun? Not sure if it's allowed.

        ""goone"": not a word.

        ""hoone"": not a word.

        ""loone"": not a word.

        ""poone"": not a word.

        ""woone"": not a word.

        So ""phone"" is a good choice.

        Alternatively, ""phone"" might be the word? 

        But we don't know.

        So I'll go with ""phone"".

        Guess: phone

        Pattern: P H O N E

        We'll see if P and H are in the word and in the correct positions.

        If the secret word is, for example, ""phone"", then we get all correct.

        If not, we get feedback on P and H.

        But note: the feedback for O, N, E will be correct again.

        So the feedback will be: P(?) H(?) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)

        And we'll know about P and H.

        Since we have only two positions to guess, and we have many letters left, we can then make another guess.

        But we have 4 guesses left? (since we used 2, so 4 left).

        So it's acceptable.

        Therefore, I choose ""phone"".

        <guess>phone</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,ozone,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess. The feedback from the first guess ""crane"" was: 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: ✓ (correct letter and position)
 E: ✓ (correct letter and position)

 That means:
 - The secret word has N in the fourth position and E in the fifth position.
 - The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word is of the form: _ _ _ N E

 We also know that the word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N and E are fixed in their positions, we need to guess the first three letters.

 For the next guess, we want to use a word that:
   - Ends with ""NE"" (because N in 4th and E in 5th are fixed)
   - Does not use the letters C, R, A (since they are not in the word)
   - Uses other common letters to gain more information.

 We know the positions of N and E, so let's think of words that match the pattern _ _ _ N E.

 We have two positions to fill: first, second, and third.

 We should avoid using C, R, A, but we can use other common letters like T, S, L, O, U, etc.

 Let me think of words ending in NE and not containing C, R, A.

 Some possibilities:
   - shine: S H I N E -> but we have to check if S, H, I are allowed? (we haven't eliminated them)
   - phone: P H O N E -> but O might be in the word? We don't know.
   - scene: but C is already eliminated -> not allowed.
   - stone: S T O N E -> but O might be? Also, we can check.

 However, note that we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize the chance of hitting the word and also get information.

 Another approach: we can try to use letters that we haven't tried yet to get information on more letters.

 The letters we have tried so far: C, R, A, N, E -> we know N and E are in and in the correct positions, and C,R,A are out.

 So letters that are not tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can choose a word that has three new letters and ends with NE.

 Let's consider:

   - LINE: L I N E -> but this uses N and E again, and L and I are new?
     Pattern: L I _ _ _ -> but our pattern is _ _ _ N E, so LINE has N in the 3rd position? Actually:
        LINE: positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E -> but we need N in the 4th and E in the 5th? 
        So we cannot use LINE because it doesn't fit the pattern (it only has 4 letters? Actually, LINE is 4 letters? No, wait: L-I-N-E -> 4 letters? 
        Actually, we need 5 letters: _ _ _ N E, so the word must be 5 letters ending with ""NE"".

     The pattern is: first letter unknown, second letter unknown, third letter unknown, fourth letter N, fifth letter E.

     So the word is: [1] [2] [3] N E

 Therefore, words like ""shine"", ""phone"", ""stone"", ""alone"", etc.

 But note: 
   ""shine"": S H I N E -> [1] S, [2] H, [3] I -> then we get feedback on S, H, I.

   ""phone"": P H O N E -> [1] P, [2] H, [3] O -> but note ""phone"" is 5 letters: P-H-O-N-E.

   ""stone"": S T O N E.

   ""alone"": but we can't use A (since A is eliminated) -> so avoid A.

   ""tune"": too short? T-U-N-E -> 4 letters? No, we need 5 letters.

   ""plane"": P-L-A-N-E -> but A is eliminated -> not allowed.

   ""prone"": P R O N E -> R is eliminated -> not allowed.

   ""spine"": S P I N E -> but we are replacing the third letter? 

 Let's think: we want to test letters that are likely to appear. Also, we can avoid letters we've eliminated.

 We have eliminated: C, R, A.

 So let's try ""shine"": 
   Positions: [1] S, [2] H, [3] I, [4] N (which we know is fixed and correct), [5] E (fixed and correct).

   If the secret is, say, ""shine"", then we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on S, H, I.

 But let's see another option: 

   ""phone"": P, H, O, N, E. 

   We haven't tried P, H, O.

   ""stone"": S, T, O, N, E.

   ""done"": D O N E -> wait, D-O-N-E -> 4 letters? Actually, 5 letter word: DONE is 4 letters? 
        Actually, D-O-N-E is 4 letters. We must have a word of 5 letters.

   ""tune"" is 4 letters, so we need 5-letter words.

   So words: 
     shine (5 letters: S, H, I, N, E)
     phone (5 letters: P, H, O, N, E)
     stone (5 letters: S, T, O, N, E)
     shone (5 letters: S, H, O, N, E) -> same as phone but with S instead of P.

   Another: ""binge"": B I N G E -> but fourth letter is G? We need N at 4th: B-I-N-G-E -> then G is at 4th? No: 
        B at 1, I at 2, N at 3 -> doesn't have N at the 4th? So that's not matching.

   We need a word of the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3]NE.

   So let's choose ""shone"" (a valid word) or ""shine"".

   But what about ""spine"": S P I N E -> but that has N at the 4th? S-P-I-N-E: 
        Position 1: S, 2: P, 3: I, 4: N, 5: E -> yes.

   Similarly, ""swine"": S W I N E.

   However, we also want to test letters that are common. 

   Let me check: 
      We don't know about S, T, P, O, etc.

   I think ""stone"" is a good candidate because it has T and O which are common.

   Also, note that we have E and N fixed, so the word must end with NE. 

   Let's consider ""thine"": T H I N E -> but ""thine"" is an old English word? Might not be common.

   But we are playing a word game and the word must be valid.

   Let me go with ""stone"": S T O N E.

   Why? 
     - It uses S, T, O which are common letters we haven't tried.
     - It fits the pattern: S at pos1, T at pos2, O at pos3, then N at pos4, E at pos5.

   Now, we avoid the eliminated letters (C,R,A) so it's safe.

   Therefore, I will guess ""stone"".

   But note: the feedback might tell us about S, T, O.

   Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried and doesn't reuse any (even though N and E are fixed and we know we have to include them).

   However, including N and E again doesn't waste anything because we know they must be there and we are using the pattern.

   So I choose ""stone"".

   Guess: stone

   Pattern: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E.

   We'll see the feedback for S, T, O and whether they are in the word and in the correct positions or not.

   If the secret word is, for example, ""phone"", then the feedback for stone would be:
        S: not in the word -> x
        T: not in the word -> x
        O: in the word but not in the correct position? Actually, in ""phone"", O is in the 3rd position so it would be correct? 
        But wait, we are comparing:

        Secret: phone -> letters: P H O N E
        Guess: stone -> S T O N E

        Comparing:
          Position 1: S vs P -> not same -> but O is in the secret? 
          Position 2: T vs H -> not same -> no match
          Position 3: O vs O -> match -> so ✓
          Position 4: N vs N -> ✓
          Position 5: E vs E -> ✓

        And for the letters: 
          S: is it in phone? No -> x
          T: in phone? No -> x
          O: in phone? Yes, and in the correct position -> ✓
          N: ✓ and E: ✓.

        So feedback: S(x) T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)

   But that's just one example.

   Actually, we don't know the secret yet.

   So, without knowing, we try ""stone"".

   Alternatively, we might also consider ""shine"" (for testing I and H) or ""phone"" (for P and H) but we can choose.

   I'll go with ""stone"".

<guess>stone</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", we know:
- The 4th letter is N (correct position)
- The 5th letter is E (correct position)
- Letters C, R, and A are absent from the secret word

The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ N E  

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Keep N in the 4th position and E in the 5th position  
2. Avoid C, R, A  
3. Test new common letters to maximize information  

Good candidate words ending in ""NE"" and excluding C/R/A:  
- **stone**: Tests S, T, O (common letters)  
- Other options considered: ""phone"" (tests P, H, O), ""shine"" (tests S, H, I)  

Selected **""stone""** because it uses high-frequency consonants (S, T) and explores diverse letters. This tests:  
- Positions 1-3: S, T, O  
- While preserving confirmed letters N/E in positions 4-5

<guess>stone</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: stone -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the third guess. The feedback so far:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: ""stone"" -> S(x) T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)

From this, we know:
- The secret word has N in the 4th position and E in the 5th position. So the pattern is: _ _ _ N E
- The letters C, R, A, S, T are NOT in the word (since they are marked as absent).
- The letter O is in the word, but from the feedback of ""stone"", O is marked as correct (✓) in the third position? 
  Let's check: 
    In ""stone"", the O is in the third position and it is marked as ✓. That means in the secret word, O is in the third position? 
  But wait, the feedback for ""stone"" is: S(x) T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓). 
  This indicates:
    - S is absent (x)
    - T is absent (x)
    - O is present and in the correct position (third) -> so the third letter of the secret word is O.
    - N and E are in the correct positions (fourth and fifth).

Therefore, we now know that the secret word has the pattern: _ _ O N E

And we know that the first two letters are not C, R, A, S, T (and also not O because O is already placed, but we know it's in the third position).

So the secret word is: [letter1] [letter2] O N E

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, S, T.

We have to choose a word that fits the pattern _ _ O N E and uses letters that are not eliminated.

We have eliminated: C, R, A, S, T.

We have confirmed: O (in position 3), N (4), E (5).

We need to guess the first two letters.

We should use new letters to test for the first two positions.

Available letters: we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to choose a word that has the form [new1] [new2] O N E.

We can try to use common letters for the first two positions.

Possible words that end with ""ONE"" and are 5 letters? Actually, the pattern is _ _ O N E, which is the same as ending with ""ONE"" but note that the O is fixed at the third position? 

Wait, the pattern is: 
  position1: unknown
  position2: unknown
  position3: O
  position4: N
  position5: E

So the word ends with ""ONE"", but the ""O"" is the third letter? Actually, the last three letters are ""O N E"", so the word ends with ""ONE"" but the O is the third from the end? 

But in terms of common words, we can think of words like:
  - phone: P H O N E -> but we have eliminated S and T, but P and H are available? 
    However, in ""phone"", the O is the third letter? Let's see: 
        P (1), H (2), O (3), N (4), E (5) -> yes, that matches the pattern.

But we have to check if P and H are allowed? We haven't eliminated them. Also, we haven't used them.

But wait, in our pattern, the first two letters are unknown, so ""phone"" would be a candidate? But we are not guessing the secret, we are trying to get information.

However, if we guess ""phone"", we are testing P and H in the first two positions.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we have 3 known positions. We might want to guess a word that could be the solution if we are lucky.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses two new letters and fits the pattern.

Let me list some words that fit _ _ O N E:

  - phone: P H O N E
  - shone: S H O N E -> but S is eliminated, so not allowed.
  - stone: S T O N E -> but S and T are eliminated, and we already tried it.
  - alone: A L O N E -> but A is eliminated.
  - bone: too short? B O N E -> 4 letters? We need 5 letters.
  - cone: C O N E -> 4 letters? and C is eliminated.
  - done: D O N E -> 4 letters? 
  - gone: G O N E -> 4 letters?
  - hone: H O N E -> 4 letters?
  - lone: L O N E -> 4 letters?
  - none: N O N E -> but that has two N's? and pattern: N O N E -> 4 letters? 
  - pone: P O N E -> 4 letters? 
  - tone: T O N E -> 4 letters? and T is eliminated.

So 5-letter words? 

  - phone: P H O N E -> valid.
  - crone: C R O N E -> but C and R are eliminated.
  - drone: D R O N E -> R is eliminated.
  - prone: P R O N E -> R is eliminated.
  - shone: S H O N E -> S is eliminated.
  - phone is one.

Another: ""ozone"": O Z O N E -> but that has two O's? and the pattern requires O at the third position. 
    O at first? O Z O N E: 
        position1: O -> but we don't know if O is allowed elsewhere? but we have O fixed at third. 
        However, the feedback for O in ""stone"" was only for the third position. 
        But the secret word might have another O? 
        But in ""ozone"", the first letter is O and the third is O. 
        But we don't know if the secret word has two O's? 
        However, the pattern we have is _ _ O N E, so the first two letters are unknown, and the third is O. 
        ""ozone"" would be: O Z O N E -> 
            position1: O -> but we don't have O in the first position? 
            position2: Z
            position3: O -> which matches
            position4: N -> matches
            position5: E -> matches
        But we have an extra O at the beginning? 

        However, we don't know if the secret word has an O at the beginning? 

        But note: we have eliminated S, T, etc., but O is already in the word (at third position) so it can appear again? 
        The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, it might be marked accordingly.

        But in our feedback for ""stone"", we had O marked as correct in the third position, but that doesn't tell us if there is another O. 

        However, we are not sure. 

        But ""ozone"" is a valid word? Yes.

        But we are trying to guess, and we want to test the first two positions.

        Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates to get clearer feedback? 

        Since we are not sure, and we have limited guesses, we might avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

        So ""phone"" is better because it has unique letters: P, H, O, N, E.

        Also, ""phone"" uses two new letters: P and H.

        Another word: ""phone"" is a common word.

        What about ""phone"": 
            If we guess ""phone"", and the secret is ""phone"", we win.
            Otherwise, we get feedback on P and H.

        But note: the pattern is fixed for the last three: O, N, E.

        So the only unknowns are the first two.

        We can also consider ""clone"": but C is eliminated.

        ""prone"": R is eliminated.

        ""thone"": not a common word? 

        ""phone"" seems a good candidate.

        But wait, we have to make sure we don't use eliminated letters. We have eliminated: C, R, A, S, T.

        P and H are not eliminated, so ""phone"" is allowed.

        Another word: ""phone"" is 5 letters and fits the pattern.

        So I will guess ""phone"".

        But let me check if there are other possibilities? 

        ""moone"": not a word? 

        ""boone"": as in Daniel Boone? but it's a proper noun? Not sure if it's allowed.

        ""goone"": not a word.

        ""hoone"": not a word.

        ""loone"": not a word.

        ""poone"": not a word.

        ""woone"": not a word.

        So ""phone"" is a good choice.

        Alternatively, ""phone"" might be the word? 

        But we don't know.

        So I'll go with ""phone"".

        Guess: phone

        Pattern: P H O N E

        We'll see if P and H are in the word and in the correct positions.

        If the secret word is, for example, ""phone"", then we get all correct.

        If not, we get feedback on P and H.

        But note: the feedback for O, N, E will be correct again.

        So the feedback will be: P(?) H(?) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)

        And we'll know about P and H.

        Since we have only two positions to guess, and we have many letters left, we can then make another guess.

        But we have 4 guesses left? (since we used 2, so 4 left).

        So it's acceptable.

        Therefore, I choose ""phone"".

        <guess>phone</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
  - N (4th position) and E (5th position) are **correct**.  
  - C, R, A are **absent** from the secret word.  
- **Guess 2 (""stone"")**:  
  - O (3rd position), N (4th), and E (5th) are **correct**.  
  - S and T are **absent**.  

### Inferred Information:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ O N E` (3rd letter is O, 4th is N, 5th is E).  
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T (cannot appear anywhere).  
3. **Unknown positions**: 1st and 2nd letters.  
4. **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need a 5-letter word fitting `_ _ O N E` that **excludes C, R, A, S, T**.  
- Prioritize **high-frequency consonants** (e.g., H, P, L, M) to test the first two positions.  
- Ideal candidates: Words like **""phone""** (tests P and H) or **""clone""** (but C is invalid).  
- **""phone"" is optimal**: Uses new letters (P, H), fits the pattern, and is a common word.  

### Why ""phone""?
- Tests P in 1st position and H in 2nd position.  
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on P/H narrows possibilities (e.g., if P is correct, H is absent, etc.).  
- Avoids eliminated letters and leverages known pattern.

Yes.\n\n        But we are trying to guess, and we want to test the first two positions.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates to get clearer feedback? \n\n        Since we are not sure, and we have limited guesses, we might avoid words with duplicate letters for now.\n\n        So ""phone"" is better because it has unique letters: P, H, O, N, E.\n\n        Also, ""phone"" uses two new letters: P and H.\n\n        Another word: ""phone"" is a common word.\n\n        What about ""phone"": \n            If we guess ""phone"", and the secret is ""phone"", we win.\n            Otherwise, we get feedback on P and H.\n\n        But note: the pattern is fixed for the last three: O, N, E.\n\n        So the only unknowns are the first two.\n\n        We can also consider ""clone"": but C is eliminated.\n\n        ""prone"": R is eliminated.\n\n        ""thone"": not a common word? \n\n        ""phone"" seems a good candidate.\n\n        But wait, we have to make sure we don\'t use eliminated letters. We have eliminated: C, R, A, S, T.\n\n        P and H are not eliminated, so ""phone"" is allowed.\n\n        Another word: ""phone"" is 5 letters and fits the pattern.\n\n        So I will guess ""phone"".\n\n        But let me check if there are other possibilities? \n\n        ""moone"": not a word? \n\n        ""boone"": as in Daniel Boone? but it\'s a proper noun? Not sure if it\'s allowed.\n\n        ""goone"": not a word.\n\n        ""hoone"": not a word.\n\n        ""loone"": not a word.\n\n        ""poone"": not a word.\n\n        ""woone"": not a word.\n\n        So ""phone"" is a good choice.\n\n        Alternatively, ""phone"" might be the word? \n\n        But we don\'t know.\n\n        So I\'ll go with ""phone"".\n\n        Guess: phone\n\n        Pattern: P H O N E\n\n        We\'ll see if P and H are in the word and in the correct positions.\n\n        If the secret word is, for example, ""phone"", then we get all correct.\n\n        If not, we get feedback on P and H.\n\n        But note: the feedback for O, N, E will be correct again.\n\n        So the feedback will be: P(?) H(?) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)\n\n        And we\'ll know about P and H.\n\n        Since we have only two positions to guess, and we have many letters left, we can then make another guess.\n\n        But we have 4 guesses left? (since we used 2, so 4 left).\n\n        So it\'s acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, I choose ""phone"".\n\n        <guess>phone</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  \n  - N (4th position) and E (5th position) are **correct**.  \n  - C, R, A are **absent** from the secret word.  \n- **Guess 2 (""stone"")**:  \n  - O (3rd position), N (4th), and E (5th) are **correct**.  \n  - S and T are **absent**.  \n\n### Inferred Information:\n1. **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ O N E` (3rd letter is O, 4th is N, 5th is E).  \n2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T (cannot appear anywhere).  \n3. **Unknown positions**: 1st and 2nd letters.  \n4. **Remaining possible letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- We need a 5-letter word fitting `_ _ O N E` that **excludes C, R, A, S, T**.  \n- Prioritize **high-frequency consonants** (e.g., H, P, L, M) to test the first two positions.  \n- Ideal candidates: Words like **""phone""** (tests P and H) or **""clone""** (but C is invalid).  \n- **""phone"" is optimal**: Uses new letters (P, H), fits the pattern, and is a common word.  \n\n### Why ""phone""?\n- Tests P in 1st position and H in 2nd position.  \n- If correct, we solve the word.

We are on the fourth guess. The feedback so far:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: ""stone"" -> S(x) T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)
Guess 3: ""phone"" -> P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)

From this, we know:
- The secret word pattern: _ _ O N E (third letter O, fourth N, fifth E).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, P, H (all marked as absent).

So we have eliminated the letters: C, R, A, S, T, P, H.

We now know the secret word is of the form: [letter1] [letter2] O N E

The first two letters cannot be any of the eliminated letters. We have to pick from the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to guess a word that fits the pattern _ _ O N E and uses letters from the remaining set.

Possible candidates:

  - ""alone"": A is eliminated -> not allowed.
  - ""clone"": C is eliminated -> not allowed.
  - ""drone"": R is eliminated? Wait, R was eliminated in the first guess? Yes -> not allowed.
  - ""prone"": R eliminated -> not allowed.
  - ""shine"": S eliminated -> not allowed.

But note, we have to avoid all eliminated letters: C,R,A,S,T,P,H.

So what words are left?

We need a 5-letter word starting with two letters from {B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} and ending with ""ONE"".

Examples:

  - ""biome"": B I O M E -> but wait, the pattern is _ _ O N E, so last three must be O-N-E. 
    ""biome"" would be B-I-O-M-E -> so positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:O, 4:M, 5:E -> this doesn't have N at position 4? 

  - Instead, we need the fourth letter to be N and fifth E? So the word must be [1][2] O N E.

  So:

  - ""bone"": too short? Not 5 letters.

  - Let's think of words that fit [letter1][letter2]ON E.

  There are not many common English words with this pattern.

  Common ones:

  - ""phone"": we already guessed and it was incorrect? Yes, with P and H absent.

  - ""stone"": already tried.

  But what about:

  - ""clone"" -> C and R? Wait, ""clone"" is C-L-O-N-E -> but C is eliminated -> cannot use.

  - ""prone"" -> P-R-O-N-E -> but P and R eliminated -> cannot use.

  - ""drone"" -> D-R-O-N-E -> R eliminated -> cannot use.

  - ""alone"" -> A-L-O-N-E -> A eliminated -> cannot use.

  - ""atone"" -> A-T-O-N-E -> A and T eliminated -> cannot use.

  - ""ozone"": O-Z-O-N-E -> but this is O-Z-O-N-E. Pattern: 
        position1: O -> we don't know if O can be in the first position? But we have O at third? 
        However, we haven't eliminated O? But the feedback from ""stone"" had O correct at third, but that doesn't preclude another O? 
        But ""ozone"": O at position1 -> but our pattern requires the third letter to be O and we have O at position1? 
        So if we guess ""ozone"", it will have O at both position1 and position3? 

        Note: The secret word might have more than one O? But we don't know.

        In ""ozone"", the pattern would be: O Z O N E -> 
          1:O, 2:Z, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E

        This matches the pattern we have? Because we require position4:N and position5:E, and position3:O? 
        Position3 is O -> that's fixed. Position1 being O? We haven't fixed position1, we just know it's not any of the eliminated letters.

        But note: the feedback for ""stone"" had O at position3 correct, and that was it? 
        In ""phone"", O was also correct? So we know O is at position3.

        But the secret word might have O at other positions? 

        We haven't tested other positions for O? 

        Why didn't we get feedback about O in position1 of ""ozone""? Actually, we haven't guessed it.

        However, in this situation, we can try ""ozone"" but let's check if it's allowed? 
            Letters: O, Z, O, N, E -> 
            We have eliminated C,R,A,S,T,P,H -> O,Z,E are not eliminated? O and E are present? 
            But note: we know O and E are in the word? O at third and E at fifth? 
            But having O at first might be possible? 

        However, we don't know if O can appear twice? But the feedback when we guessed ""stone"" only showed one O? 
            In ""stone"", there was only one O? So we got one O correct? 
            If the secret word had two O's, we might have gotten more indications? 

        Actually, in Wordle, the feedback treats multiple letters independently. 
        For example, if the secret is ""OZONE"" and we guess ""STONE"", we get:
            S (absent) -> x
            T (absent) -> x
            O (in the secret? at position3: correct, so ✓. And also, the secret has an O at position1? Doesn't matter because we didn't guess O at position1. 
            So the feedback for ""stone"" would not show anything about the first O? 

        Similarly, if we guess ""phone"", we only get O at third.

        We haven't tested O in position1? 

        But wait, we can use duplicate letters? 

        However, we have a limited set. 

        Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates? 

        But let's see: 

            The pattern is fixed for positions 3,4,5: O, N, E.
            Position1 and 2: must be two letters from the remaining set? 

        Other words that fit the pattern? 

        - ""done"": too short? D-O-N-E -> 4 letters? 

        5-letter words: 

        - ""crone"": C R -> eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""prone"": P R -> eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""drone"": D R -> R eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""atone"": A T -> eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""alone"": A L -> A eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""clone"": C L -> C eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""shone"": S H -> S and H eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""thone"": not a word? 
        - ""who-ne"": hyphenated? 

        So common words? 

        What about ""moone""? Not a word.

        Or ""boone"": As in Boone? Proper noun? Might not be allowed.

        ""goone"": not a word.

        ""loone"": not a word.

        ""poone"": not a word.

        ""woone"": not a word.

        ""zone"": short? 4 letters.

        So that leaves ""ozone"" as a valid word that fits the pattern?  

        Alternatively, are there any other common words? 

        I think ""ozone"" is acceptable.

        But we don't know about the first two letters? 

        Another possibility: ""ionic"": 5 letters but does not fit the pattern? We need O at third and N at fourth? 

        Actually, we must have the pattern _ _ O N E.

        Words like ""dione"": but ""dione"" would be D-I-O-N-E -> that's 5 letters: 
            positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> yes, that matches.

        Is ""dione"" a word? It is a moon of Saturn? Or a chemical term? It might be accepted as a word.

        Similarly, ""bione""? Not a word.

        ""fione"": not a word.

        ""gione"": not a word.

        ""kione"": not a word.

        ""lione"": not a word? 

        ""mione"": not a word.

        ""qione"": not a word.

        ""uione"": not a word? 

        ""vione"": not a word.

        ""wione"": not a word.

        ""xione"": not a word.

        ""yione"": not a word.

        ""zione"": not a word.

        What about ""minae"": not matching pattern.

        Another idea: ""downe"" -> but that doesn't have O? D-O-W-N-E? Then position3: W -> but we need O at position3? 

        No, pattern must be: [1][2] O N E.

        Maybe ""donee"": D-O-N-E-E -> but that has two E's? 
            positions: D (1), O (2), N (3), E (4), E (5) -> but that is D O N E E -> 
            We require position3: O -> but ""donee"" has O at position2? and position3:N? -> doesn't match.

        ""donne"": Donne as in John Donne? D-O-N-N-E -> positions: D(1), O(2), N(3), N(4), E(5) -> 
            pattern: _ _ O N E? That would require the third letter to be O? 
            But in ""donne"", O is at position2 -> doesn't match.

        So uncommon words? 

        ""Dione"" (with capital D) might be accepted? But in word games, sometimes proper nouns are not allowed.

        Therefore, ""ozone"" might be a better choice? 

        We have another possibility: ""boney"": B-O-N-E-Y -> doesn't match.

        ""money"": M-O-N-E-Y -> that's M O N E Y -> 
            positions: M(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> 
            But we need pattern: [1][2] O N E -> so position3:O? But in ""money"", O is at position2 -> doesn't match.

        So we must have the third letter O.

        Therefore, I think the only common word is ""ozone""?

        But what about ""jones"": J-O-N-E-S -> 
            J(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5) -> that doesn't match because we need O at position3? Here O is at position2.

        ""bones"": B-O-N-E-S -> not matching pattern? We need O at position3? 

        So it seems challenging.

        Another word: ""blonde"": 6 letters? Too long.

        What about ""comae"": not matching.

        Let me search in my memory: 

        Words ending with ""ONE"": 
          ""phone"" - tried
          ""stone"" - tried
          ""alone"" - invalid because of A
          ""clone"" - invalid because of C
          ""prone"" - invalid because of P and R
          ""drone"" - invalid because of R
          ""shone"" - invalid because of S and H
          ""atone"" - invalid because of A and T
          ""ozone"" - possible? 
          ""throne"": but that is T-H-R-O-N-E -> 6 letters? No, T-H-R-O-N-E -> 6 letters? Wait, throne is 6 letters? 
            T-H-R-O-N-E -> 6? Actually, ""throne"" is T-H-R-O-N-E -> that's 6 letters? Actually, throne is 5 letters? T-H-R-O-N? No, throne is spelled T-H-R-O-N-E? 
            Actually, it's T-H-R-O-N-E -> 6 letters? 
            T-H-R-O-N-E -> positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:R, 4:O, 5:N? Wait, that's only 5 letters: T-H-R-O-N? 
            But throne has an E? Throne is T-H-R-O-N-E -> 6 characters? 

          Actually, throne is T-H-R-O-N-E? That would be 6 letters? No, throne has 5 letters: T,H,R,O,N,E? Actually, no: 
            T-H-R-O-N-E -> 6? 
            I think throne is 6 letters? But wait, no: 
            throne: T-H-R-O-N-E -> that's 6 letters? 

          Actually, the word ""throne"" is spelled T-H-R-O-N-E? But that would be 6 letters? 

          In fact, ""throne"" has 5 letters? 

          Correction: 
             T-H-R-O-N-E? That's 6 characters. 
             Actually, throne is spelled T-H-R-O-N-E? 
             T, H, R, O, N, E -> but that's 6 letters? 

          I think I'm confusing.

          Let me count: 
            t-h-r-o-n-e -> 6 letters? 
          But the word ""throne"" is five letters? 
          No, it is six letters: t-h-r-o-n-e.

          So it's too long? 

          So back to square one.

        So the only plausible common word is ""ozone"". 

        Therefore, I will guess ""ozone"".

        Pattern: O Z O N E

        And feedback will tell us about O at position1 and Z at position2? 

        If the secret word is ""ozone"", then we win.

        Otherwise, we get feedback for O and Z? 

        But note: if the secret word does not have O at position1, then the feedback will mark it differently? 

        But we also have O at position3 which we know is fixed? 

        The feedback: 
          If we guess ""ozone"", and the secret is say ""phone"", but phone was already eliminated? 

        We have no other candidates? 

        Alternatively, is there another word we are missing? 

        What about ""downe""? D-O-W-N-E -> pattern: 
            Position1: D, Position2: O? But we need position3 to be O? In this, position2 is O? -> no? 

        We require the third letter to be O? 

        How about ""booze"": B-O-O-Z-E -> but pattern: 
            Position1:B, 2:O, 3:O, 4:Z, 5:E -> not matching? We need position4:N and position5:E? 

        No.

        ""joked"": doesn't have O at third? 

        So ""ozone"" seems the only possibility? 

        Otherwise, we are forced to guess words that might not be common? 

        But let's consider: we might be missing some words.

        Another attempt: ""dione"" is a word? As in ""Saturn's moon Dione"". 
          But if proper nouns are disallowed, we cannot use.

        Similarly, ""pione"": not a word.

        So ""ozone"" is the best choice.

        Therefore, I will guess ""ozone"".

        <guess>ozone</guess>

        If it's not accepted, we'll have to use a different word, but it's valid.

        So finalized.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current Pattern**:  
   From feedback:  
   - Position 4 = N (✓ from all guesses)  
   - Position 5 = E (✓ from all guesses)  
   - Position 3 = O (✓ from ""stone"" and ""phone"")  
   - Absent letters: **C, R, A, S, T, P, H** (marked ""x"" in past guesses).  
   
   Secret word format: `[1st][2nd] O N E`.  

2. **Eliminated Letters**:  
   Letters **C, R, A, S, T, P, H** are confirmed absent.  

3. **Available Letters**:  
   B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since O, N, E are placed).  

4. **Possible Words**:  
   - Must fit `_ _ O N E`.  
   - Common words with this pattern:  
     - ""clone"" (invalid: C eliminated)  
     - ""drone"" (invalid: R eliminated)  
     - ""phone"" (already guessed, invalid)  
     - ""stone"" (already guessed, invalid)  
     - ""alone"" (invalid: A eliminated)  
     - **""ozone""** (fitting `O Z O N E`, valid as it uses available letters).  

5. **Why ""ozone""**:  
   - Tests ""O"" in position 1 (to check for duplicate ""O"") and ""Z"" in position 2.  
   - If correct, solves the puzzle. If not, feedback on ""O"" and ""Z"" will narrow possibilities further.  
   - No other common English words fit `_ _ O N E` with remaining letters.  

6. **Remaining Uncertainty**:  
   If ""ozone"" is incorrect, next guesses could test others (e.g., ""dione"" if valid, though uncommon). Focus on maximizing info with high-likelihood letters.

<guess>ozone</guess>",ozone,"We are on the fourth guess. The feedback so far:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: ""stone"" -> S(x) T(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)
Guess 3: ""phone"" -> P(x) H(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓)

From this, we know:
- The secret word pattern: _ _ O N E (third letter O, fourth N, fifth E).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, P, H (all marked as absent).

So we have eliminated the letters: C, R, A, S, T, P, H.

We now know the secret word is of the form: [letter1] [letter2] O N E

The first two letters cannot be any of the eliminated letters. We have to pick from the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to guess a word that fits the pattern _ _ O N E and uses letters from the remaining set.

Possible candidates:

  - ""alone"": A is eliminated -> not allowed.
  - ""clone"": C is eliminated -> not allowed.
  - ""drone"": R is eliminated? Wait, R was eliminated in the first guess? Yes -> not allowed.
  - ""prone"": R eliminated -> not allowed.
  - ""shine"": S eliminated -> not allowed.

But note, we have to avoid all eliminated letters: C,R,A,S,T,P,H.

So what words are left?

We need a 5-letter word starting with two letters from {B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} and ending with ""ONE"".

Examples:

  - ""biome"": B I O M E -> but wait, the pattern is _ _ O N E, so last three must be O-N-E. 
    ""biome"" would be B-I-O-M-E -> so positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:O, 4:M, 5:E -> this doesn't have N at position 4? 

  - Instead, we need the fourth letter to be N and fifth E? So the word must be [1][2] O N E.

  So:

  - ""bone"": too short? Not 5 letters.

  - Let's think of words that fit [letter1][letter2]ON E.

  There are not many common English words with this pattern.

  Common ones:

  - ""phone"": we already guessed and it was incorrect? Yes, with P and H absent.

  - ""stone"": already tried.

  But what about:

  - ""clone"" -> C and R? Wait, ""clone"" is C-L-O-N-E -> but C is eliminated -> cannot use.

  - ""prone"" -> P-R-O-N-E -> but P and R eliminated -> cannot use.

  - ""drone"" -> D-R-O-N-E -> R eliminated -> cannot use.

  - ""alone"" -> A-L-O-N-E -> A eliminated -> cannot use.

  - ""atone"" -> A-T-O-N-E -> A and T eliminated -> cannot use.

  - ""ozone"": O-Z-O-N-E -> but this is O-Z-O-N-E. Pattern: 
        position1: O -> we don't know if O can be in the first position? But we have O at third? 
        However, we haven't eliminated O? But the feedback from ""stone"" had O correct at third, but that doesn't preclude another O? 
        But ""ozone"": O at position1 -> but our pattern requires the third letter to be O and we have O at position1? 
        So if we guess ""ozone"", it will have O at both position1 and position3? 

        Note: The secret word might have more than one O? But we don't know.

        In ""ozone"", the pattern would be: O Z O N E -> 
          1:O, 2:Z, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E

        This matches the pattern we have? Because we require position4:N and position5:E, and position3:O? 
        Position3 is O -> that's fixed. Position1 being O? We haven't fixed position1, we just know it's not any of the eliminated letters.

        But note: the feedback for ""stone"" had O at position3 correct, and that was it? 
        In ""phone"", O was also correct? So we know O is at position3.

        But the secret word might have O at other positions? 

        We haven't tested other positions for O? 

        Why didn't we get feedback about O in position1 of ""ozone""? Actually, we haven't guessed it.

        However, in this situation, we can try ""ozone"" but let's check if it's allowed? 
            Letters: O, Z, O, N, E -> 
            We have eliminated C,R,A,S,T,P,H -> O,Z,E are not eliminated? O and E are present? 
            But note: we know O and E are in the word? O at third and E at fifth? 
            But having O at first might be possible? 

        However, we don't know if O can appear twice? But the feedback when we guessed ""stone"" only showed one O? 
            In ""stone"", there was only one O? So we got one O correct? 
            If the secret word had two O's, we might have gotten more indications? 

        Actually, in Wordle, the feedback treats multiple letters independently. 
        For example, if the secret is ""OZONE"" and we guess ""STONE"", we get:
            S (absent) -> x
            T (absent) -> x
            O (in the secret? at position3: correct, so ✓. And also, the secret has an O at position1? Doesn't matter because we didn't guess O at position1. 
            So the feedback for ""stone"" would not show anything about the first O? 

        Similarly, if we guess ""phone"", we only get O at third.

        We haven't tested O in position1? 

        But wait, we can use duplicate letters? 

        However, we have a limited set. 

        Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates? 

        But let's see: 

            The pattern is fixed for positions 3,4,5: O, N, E.
            Position1 and 2: must be two letters from the remaining set? 

        Other words that fit the pattern? 

        - ""done"": too short? D-O-N-E -> 4 letters? 

        5-letter words: 

        - ""crone"": C R -> eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""prone"": P R -> eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""drone"": D R -> R eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""atone"": A T -> eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""alone"": A L -> A eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""clone"": C L -> C eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""shone"": S H -> S and H eliminated -> invalid.
        - ""thone"": not a word? 
        - ""who-ne"": hyphenated? 

        So common words? 

        What about ""moone""? Not a word.

        Or ""boone"": As in Boone? Proper noun? Might not be allowed.

        ""goone"": not a word.

        ""loone"": not a word.

        ""poone"": not a word.

        ""woone"": not a word.

        ""zone"": short? 4 letters.

        So that leaves ""ozone"" as a valid word that fits the pattern?  

        Alternatively, are there any other common words? 

        I think ""ozone"" is acceptable.

        But we don't know about the first two letters? 

        Another possibility: ""ionic"": 5 letters but does not fit the pattern? We need O at third and N at fourth? 

        Actually, we must have the pattern _ _ O N E.

        Words like ""dione"": but ""dione"" would be D-I-O-N-E -> that's 5 letters: 
            positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> yes, that matches.

        Is ""dione"" a word? It is a moon of Saturn? Or a chemical term? It might be accepted as a word.

        Similarly, ""bione""? Not a word.

        ""fione"": not a word.

        ""gione"": not a word.

        ""kione"": not a word.

        ""lione"": not a word? 

        ""mione"": not a word.

        ""qione"": not a word.

        ""uione"": not a word? 

        ""vione"": not a word.

        ""wione"": not a word.

        ""xione"": not a word.

        ""yione"": not a word.

        ""zione"": not a word.

        What about ""minae"": not matching pattern.

        Another idea: ""downe"" -> but that doesn't have O? D-O-W-N-E? Then position3: W -> but we need O at position3? 

        No, pattern must be: [1][2] O N E.

        Maybe ""donee"": D-O-N-E-E -> but that has two E's? 
            positions: D (1), O (2), N (3), E (4), E (5) -> but that is D O N E E -> 
            We require position3: O -> but ""donee"" has O at position2? and position3:N? -> doesn't match.

        ""donne"": Donne as in John Donne? D-O-N-N-E -> positions: D(1), O(2), N(3), N(4), E(5) -> 
            pattern: _ _ O N E? That would require the third letter to be O? 
            But in ""donne"", O is at position2 -> doesn't match.

        So uncommon words? 

        ""Dione"" (with capital D) might be accepted? But in word games, sometimes proper nouns are not allowed.

        Therefore, ""ozone"" might be a better choice? 

        We have another possibility: ""boney"": B-O-N-E-Y -> doesn't match.

        ""money"": M-O-N-E-Y -> that's M O N E Y -> 
            positions: M(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> 
            But we need pattern: [1][2] O N E -> so position3:O? But in ""money"", O is at position2 -> doesn't match.

        So we must have the third letter O.

        Therefore, I think the only common word is ""ozone""?

        But what about ""jones"": J-O-N-E-S -> 
            J(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5) -> that doesn't match because we need O at position3? Here O is at position2.

        ""bones"": B-O-N-E-S -> not matching pattern? We need O at position3? 

        So it seems challenging.

        Another word: ""blonde"": 6 letters? Too long.

        What about ""comae"": not matching.

        Let me search in my memory: 

        Words ending with ""ONE"": 
          ""phone"" - tried
          ""stone"" - tried
          ""alone"" - invalid because of A
          ""clone"" - invalid because of C
          ""prone"" - invalid because of P and R
          ""drone"" - invalid because of R
          ""shone"" - invalid because of S and H
          ""atone"" - invalid because of A and T
          ""ozone"" - possible? 
          ""throne"": but that is T-H-R-O-N-E -> 6 letters? No, T-H-R-O-N-E -> 6 letters? Wait, throne is 6 letters? 
            T-H-R-O-N-E -> 6? Actually, ""throne"" is T-H-R-O-N-E -> that's 6 letters? Actually, throne is 5 letters? T-H-R-O-N? No, throne is spelled T-H-R-O-N-E? 
            Actually, it's T-H-R-O-N-E -> 6 letters? 
            T-H-R-O-N-E -> positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:R, 4:O, 5:N? Wait, that's only 5 letters: T-H-R-O-N? 
            But throne has an E? Throne is T-H-R-O-N-E -> 6 characters? 

          Actually, throne is T-H-R-O-N-E? That would be 6 letters? No, throne has 5 letters: T,H,R,O,N,E? Actually, no: 
            T-H-R-O-N-E -> 6? 
            I think throne is 6 letters? But wait, no: 
            throne: T-H-R-O-N-E -> that's 6 letters? 

          Actually, the word ""throne"" is spelled T-H-R-O-N-E? But that would be 6 letters? 

          In fact, ""throne"" has 5 letters? 

          Correction: 
             T-H-R-O-N-E? That's 6 characters. 
             Actually, throne is spelled T-H-R-O-N-E? 
             T, H, R, O, N, E -> but that's 6 letters? 

          I think I'm confusing.

          Let me count: 
            t-h-r-o-n-e -> 6 letters? 
          But the word ""throne"" is five letters? 
          No, it is six letters: t-h-r-o-n-e.

          So it's too long? 

          So back to square one.

        So the only plausible common word is ""ozone"". 

        Therefore, I will guess ""ozone"".

        Pattern: O Z O N E

        And feedback will tell us about O at position1 and Z at position2? 

        If the secret word is ""ozone"", then we win.

        Otherwise, we get feedback for O and Z? 

        But note: if the secret word does not have O at position1, then the feedback will mark it differently? 

        But we also have O at position3 which we know is fixed? 

        The feedback: 
          If we guess ""ozone"", and the secret is say ""phone"", but phone was already eliminated? 

        We have no other candidates? 

        Alternatively, is there another word we are missing? 

        What about ""downe""? D-O-W-N-E -> pattern: 
            Position1: D, Position2: O? But we need position3 to be O? In this, position2 is O? -> no? 

        We require the third letter to be O? 

        How about ""booze"": B-O-O-Z-E -> but pattern: 
            Position1:B, 2:O, 3:O, 4:Z, 5:E -> not matching? We need position4:N and position5:E? 

        No.

        ""joked"": doesn't have O at third? 

        So ""ozone"" seems the only possibility? 

        Otherwise, we are forced to guess words that might not be common? 

        But let's consider: we might be missing some words.
