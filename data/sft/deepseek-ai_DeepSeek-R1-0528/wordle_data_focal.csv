We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get back (i.e., covers common letters and positions).
Common starting words in similar games (like Wordle) often include words with a mix of frequent consonants and vowels. 
A good starting word should have:
- No repeated letters (so we can test more letters)
- Common letters: e.g., vowels like A, E, I, O and consonants like R, S, T, L, N

A common choice is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But note the rules: the word must be a valid English word.

Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it covers:
- C: a common consonant
- R: a common consonant
- A: a vowel
- N: a common consonant
- E: a common vowel

However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we are free to choose any starting word.

Alternatively, we can use ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word albeit uncommon) for high frequency? But let's stick to a common word.

Another popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has R, A, I, S, E - all of which are very common.

Let me choose ""RAISE"" because:

- R, S: very common consonants
- A, E: vowels
- I: also a vowel

It covers many common letters.

But note: since the example word was ""BRISK"", we don't want to be biased by that. We are making a blind first guess.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also great: S, L, A, T, E.

I think ""SLATE"" is a very solid first guess because:

- S and T are among the most common consonants
- L is also common
- A and E are vowels

So I choose ""SLATE"".

However, note that the rules allow any valid English word. Let me confirm ""slate"" is valid: yes, meaning a thin piece of rock or a verb meaning schedule.

Therefore, my first guess is SLATE.

But wait, the example in the problem used words like ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"", so we know these are words that the game accepts. We are free to choose any valid word.

I think I'll go with ""CRATE"" because:

- C, R, T: common consonants
- A, E: vowels

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also common and has C, R, A, N, E.

But note: the letter N is slightly more common than T? According to letter frequencies in English:

E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C ...

So having either T or N is fine.

I recall that ""ROATE"" is sometimes used by enthusiasts (it's a valid word meaning the accumulated result of growth) but it might be considered obscure. We should stick to common words.

Therefore, I choose ""SLATE"" as it covers more top letters: S (7th most common), L (8th), A (2nd), T (5th), E (1st).

So let's go with ""SLATE"".

But note: the example word BRISK has no S? Actually it does: BRISK has S! However, in the example guess ""STORM"" gave feedback for S as '-' meaning it exists but in wrong place? No, in the example:

Secret: BRISK
Guess: STORM -> S is in BRISK? The positions: 
BRISK: position 4 is S? Actually: B-R-I-S-K -> S is at index 3 (if starting index 0).
STORM: S at index 0, which is not 3 -> so '-' is correct.

So S in STORM was indeed in the word but wrong place? Wait, note BRISK does have an S? Actually BRISK: letters B,R,I,S,K -> yes, it has S.

But that we don't know initially.

So I'm sticking with SLATE.

Alternatively, to avoid duplicate letters and maximize distinct common letters, I'll use ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

It's also a word the game will have.

So I'll go with ""CRANE"".

But let me check: CRANE: C is 12th, R is 3rd?, A is 2nd?, N is 6th, E is 1st? Roughly.

Frequency order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L, D, U, C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q, J, Z.

So: 
E:1, A:3? Actually:

Typical frequencies: 
E: 11.16%, A: 8.49%, R: 7.58%, I: 7.54%, O: 7.16%, T: 6.95%, N: 6.65%, S: 5.73%, L: 5.48%, C: 4.54%

So:
E: 1st, T: 6th, A: 2nd, O: 5th, I: 4th, N: 7th, S: 8th, R: 3rd, C: 10th? (ranks vary slightly by corpus)

We want higher frequency? Actually, the combination matters.

But note: we don't know which position they are in, so the distribution across the word also matters? Not at first guess.

But a balanced starting word.

I think both are good. I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:

R: 3rd
A: 2nd
I: 4th
S: 8th
E: 1st

So 5 letters from the top 8? Not exactly: S is 8, E is 1, A 2, R 3, I 4? Yes, top 8. 

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S(8), L(9), A(2), T(6), E(1) -> top 9? L is 9th? 
But note: in the frequency list above, L is 9th? Yes.

Actually ""RAISE"" has higher average rank? 

RAISE: E, A, R, I, S -> ranks: 1,2,3,4,8 -> average: (1+2+3+4+8)/5=18/5=3.6

SLATE: E(1), L(9), A(2), T(6), S(8) -> average: (1+9+2+6+8)/5=26/5=5.2

So RAISE has a better letter frequency average?

But also, we want to cover vowel and consonant positions.

Alternatively, ""SOARE"" is a falconry term (uncommon) or ""ALTER"" has repeated T? No, ALTER: A,L,T,E,R -> distinct? Yes.

But ALTER: A,L,T,E,R -> ranks 2,9,6,1,3 -> average: (2+9+6+1+3)/5=21/5=4.2

So RAISE seems slightly better.

I'll use ""RAISE"".

So my first guess is ""RAISE"".

But note: the example used ""BRAVE"" and others. We don't know the word set? Actually, the secret word will be a valid English word, presumably common? The problem says a valid English word.

Also, ""raise"" is very common.

So let's go with RAISE.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" might be better? It has N which is 7th? And not in RAISE? But RAISE has I which is 4th? It's a trade-off.

But I think I have decision fatigue. ""RAISE"" is a fine starting word.

Final decision: RAISE.
</think>
I am making my first guess with no prior information. To maximize the feedback I receive, I should choose a word that includes common letters and distinct vowels and consonants to cover as many possibilities as possible. Common starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are often used because they include high-frequency letters and reduce redundancy.

After considering:
- **Letter frequency**: English letter frequencies rank E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, and L among the top. A good starting word includes several of these.
- **Diversity**: Avoid repeated letters to test more letters.
- **Balanced vowels and consonants**: Aim for 2-3 vowels and the rest consonants for broader coverage.

""RAISE"" is chosen because:
- It includes five distinct letters: R (3rd most common), A (2nd), I (4th), S (8th), and E (1st).
- It covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- It has a high average letter frequency rank, which is favorable for early information.
- ""RAISE"" is a common English word, so it is valid.

This guess will provide feedback on which letters are present or not, helping narrow down the secret word for subsequent guesses.

But note the rules: the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s choose ""CRANE"" because it covers:\n- C: a common consonant\n- R: a common consonant\n- A: a vowel\n- N: a common consonant\n- E: a common vowel\n\nHowever, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we are free to choose any starting word.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word albeit uncommon) for high frequency? But let\'s stick to a common word.\n\nAnother popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has R, A, I, S, E - all of which are very common.\n\nLet me choose ""RAISE"" because:\n\n- R, S: very common consonants\n- A, E: vowels\n- I: also a vowel\n\nIt covers many common letters.\n\nBut note: since the example word was ""BRISK"", we don\'t want to be biased by that. We are making a blind first guess.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLATE"" is also great: S, L, A, T, E.\n\nI think ""SLATE"" is a very solid first guess because:\n\n- S and T are among the most common consonants\n- L is also common\n- A and E are vowels\n\nSo I choose ""SLATE"".\n\nHowever, note that the rules allow any valid English word. Let me confirm ""slate"" is valid: yes, meaning a thin piece of rock or a verb meaning schedule.\n\nTherefore, my first guess is SLATE.\n\nBut wait, the example in the problem used words like ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"", so we know these are words that the game accepts. We are free to choose any valid word.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""CRATE"" because:\n\n- C, R, T: common consonants\n- A, E: vowels\n\nAlternatively, ""CRANE"" is also common and has C, R, A, N, E.\n\nBut note: the letter N is slightly more common than T? According to letter frequencies in English:\n\nE, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C ...\n\nSo having either T or N is fine.\n\nI recall that ""ROATE"" is sometimes used by enthusiasts (it\'s a valid word meaning the accumulated result of growth) but it might be considered obscure. We should stick to common words.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""SLATE"" as it covers more top letters: S (7th most common), L (8th), A (2nd), T (5th), E (1st).\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SLATE"".\n\nBut note: the example word BRISK has no S? Actually it does: BRISK has S! However, in the example guess ""STORM"" gave feedback for S as \'-\' meaning it exists but in wrong place? No, in the example:\n\nSecret: BRISK\nGuess: STORM -> S is in BRISK? The positions: \nBRISK: position 4 is S? Actually: B-R-I-S-K -> S is at index 3 (if starting index 0).\nSTORM: S at index 0, which is not 3 -> so \'-\' is correct.\n\nSo S in STORM was indeed in the word but wrong place? Wait, note BRISK does have an S? Actually BRISK: letters B,R,I,S,K -> yes, it has S.\n\nBut that we don\'t know initially.\n\nSo I\'m sticking with SLATE.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid duplicate letters and maximize distinct common letters, I\'ll use ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.\n\nIt\'s also a word the game will have.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CRANE"".\n\nBut let me check: CRANE: C is 12th, R is 3rd?, A is 2nd?, N is 6th, E is 1st? Roughly.\n\nFrequency order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L, D, U, C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q, J, Z.\n\nSo: \nE:1, A:3? Actually:\n\nTypical frequencies: \nE: 11.16%, A: 8.49%, R: 7.58%, I: 7.54%, O: 7.16%, T: 6.95%, N: 6.65%, S: 5.73%, L: 5.48%, C: 4.54%\n\nSo:\nE: 1st, T: 6th, A: 2nd, O: 5th, I: 4th, N: 7th, S: 8th, R: 3rd, C: 10th? (ranks vary slightly by corpus)\n\nWe want higher frequency? Actually, the combination matters.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know which position they are in, so the distribution across the word also matters? Not at first guess.\n\nBut a balanced starting word.\n\nI think both are good. I\'ll go with ""RAISE"" because:\n\nR: 3rd\nA: 2nd\nI: 4th\nS: 8th\nE: 1st\n\nSo 5 letters from the top 8? Not exactly: S is 8, E is 1, A 2, R 3, I 4? Yes, top 8. \n\nSimilarly, ""SLATE"": S(8), L(9), A(2), T(6), E(1) -> top 9? L is 9th? \nBut note: in the frequency list above, L is 9th? Yes.\n\nActually ""RAISE"" has higher average rank? \n\nRAISE: E, A, R, I, S -> ranks: 1,2,3,4,8 -> average: (1+2+3+4+8)/5=18/5=3.6\n\nSLATE: E(1), L(9), A(2), T(6), S(8) -> average: (1+9+2+6+8)/5=26/5=5.2\n\nSo RAISE has a better letter frequency average?\n\nBut also, we want to cover vowel and consonant positions.\n\nAlternatively, ""SOARE"" is a falconry term (uncommon) or ""ALTER"" has repeated T? No, ALTER: A,L,T,E,R -> distinct? Yes.\n\nBut ALTER: A,L,T,E,R -> ranks 2,9,6,1,3 -> average: (2+9+6+1+3)/5=21/5=4.2\n\nSo RAISE seems slightly better.\n\nI\'ll use ""RAISE"".\n\nSo my first guess is ""RAISE"".\n\nBut note: the example used ""BRAVE"" and others. We don\'t know the word set? Actually, the secret word will be a valid English word, presumably common? The problem says a valid English word.\n\nAlso, ""raise"" is very common.\n\nSo let\'s go with RAISE.\n\nAlternatively, ""CRANE"" might be better? It has N which is 7th? And not in RAISE? But RAISE has I which is 4th? It\'s a trade-off.\n\nBut I think I have decision fatigue. ""RAISE"" is a fine starting word.\n\nFinal decision: RAISE.I am making my first guess with no prior information. To maximize the feedback I receive, I should choose a word that includes common letters and distinct vowels and consonants to cover as many possibilities as possible. Common starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are often used because they include high-frequency letters and reduce redundancy.\n\nAfter considering:\n- **Letter frequency**: English letter frequencies rank E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, and L among the top. A good starting word includes several of these.\n- **Diversity**: Avoid repeated letters to test more letters.\n- **Balanced vowels and consonants**: Aim for 2-3 vowels and the rest consonants for broader coverage.\n\n""RAISE"" is chosen because:\n- It includes five distinct letters: R (3rd most common), A (2nd), I (4th), S (8th), and E (1st).\n- It covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n- It has a high average letter frequency rank, which is favorable for early information.\n- ""RAISE"" is a common English word, so it is valid.\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on which letters are present or not, helping narrow down the secret word for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The secret word does not contain R, I, S, or E.
2. The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in RAISE, A is the second letter and we got '-', meaning present but not in that position).

Therefore, the secret word must contain A, but at a position other than the second. The positions are:
- Index 0: first letter
- Index 1: second letter (so A cannot be here)
- Index 2: third letter
- Index 3: fourth letter
- Index 4: fifth letter

Also, we must avoid using the letters R, I, S, E in our new guess.

Therefore, the new guess must:
- Be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Include the letter A, but not in position 1 (index 1).
- Avoid letters R, I, S, E entirely.

Additionally, to maximize information, we should use:
- Common consonants that are still possibilities, such as T, N, O, L, C, etc.
- Other vowels: O, U are possible since we haven't tried them (A is confirmed present).

Available letters: We have used R, A, I, S, E. So we know A is in the word, so we should reuse it in the new word but not at position 1. The rest of the letters should come from unguessed letters.

Since the secret word has exactly 5 letters and we have eliminated R, I, S, E, the remaining letters to use are from the rest of the alphabet without R, I, S, E.

Also note: the secret word must have A somewhere, so we must include A in our new guess but at a position that is not 1 (index 1).

Possible positions for A: index 0, 2, 3, or 4.

We must choose a word that fits the criteria and contains A in one of these positions, and the other four letters should be new (excluding R, I, S, E).

We should also aim for words with high-frequency letters to test them. Common letters left: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's brainstorm words that:
- Do not contain R, I, S, E.
- Contain A, but not in the second position.

For example:
- If A is at position 0: words like ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""ADMIT"", but note we have to avoid R, I, S, E: 
  - ""ABOUT"": contains B, O, U, T. Avoids R,I,S,E? Yes. And A is at 0. So valid? But let's check: positions: A at 0 (allowed), B, O, U, T. But we must avoid S? Yes, so ABOUT is acceptable? It contains O, U, T, and B. But note: the secret word contains A, but we don't know if it contains O, U, etc. This is a valid guess.
- Alternatively, A at position 2: e.g., ""TRACK"", but has R and S? Avoid R and S -> not allowed.
- Another word: ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O. A is at position 1? In ""MANGO"", positions: M(0), A(1), N(2), G(3), O(4). We cannot have A at position 1, so this is invalid for our guess? Because we know A cannot be at index 1. So we must not put A at index 1.

Therefore, we look for words with A at indices 0,2,3,4.

Examples of A at index 0: ABOUT, ABOVE (but E? Avoid E -> not allowed), ACTED (E? Avoid), ADAPT (avoid S? S not here? E? No, but D and P). ADAPT: A at 0, then D,A,P,T? No: A-D-A-P-T -> waits, ADAPT? It has A at 0 and 2? But we are allowed? We are forced to put A only where we guess? Actually, we are allowed to have A only at one position? No, a word can have multiple A's? But in the feedback, we know that A is present at least once, but it might be multiple? Since we are not limited.

But in our guess, we are free to put A wherever we want? Even if the word might have multiple A's? Yes, but the feedback will tell us.

However, we have to avoid letters R,I,S,E anywhere.

So for index 0 A: 
Candidate: ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> letters: A (at 0), B (new), O (new), U (new), T (new). Avoids R,I,S,E. So valid.

Another: ""ADULT"": A,D,U,L,T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. A at 0.

But position 1 is D? That is allowed. We have to put A in positions other than 1? We are placing A at 0, so that is okay.

But also, we can try with A at other positions.

A at index 2: e.g., ""PLANT"": P,L,A,N,T -> A at index 2? Positions: P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes.

But note: we don't know if A is at index 2? We are just trying.

A at index 3: e.g., ""CROWN"" has no A? ""CHAOS"" has H and O? But S? Avoid S -> CHAOS ends with S? Invalid. ""CLAPT""? Not a word. ""QUART"" has R? Avoid R.

Alternatively, ""TUNAH""? Not a word. ""PIANO"" has I? Avoid I. So hard to find A at index 3.

A at index 4: e.g., ""TUBAL""? has U,B,A,L -> A at position 3? Wait: T,U,B,A,L -> that's 5 letters? T(0), U(1), B(2), A(3), L(4). So A is at index 3? Then to have A at index 4: e.g., ""ALBUM"" puts A at 0 and U? Doesn't work. ""AVAIL"" has V,A,I at index 2? Avoid I. ""PIZZA"" has I and Z? Avoid I. So harder.

So easier: put A at index 0 or 2.

Which to choose? We want to test more common letters.

Available high-frequency letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

If we choose a word with A at 0 and avoid R,I,S,E, we can use ABOUT: which uses O, U, T, B -> covering common letters? B is less common? O and T are very common.

ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> letters: 
A is confirmed and we are placing it at 0 (might be confirmed? It must be tested).

Alternatively, we can choose a word that places A not at 0? Because if the secret word does not have A at 0, then putting at 0 might not be efficient? But we have no information about positions, so by putting at index 0 we test that position.

Similarly, putting at index 2 tests that position.

To maximize coverage, we can try:

CANDO? Not a word. PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> avoids R,I,S,E.

But in PLANT: A is at index 2. If the secret word has A at 2, then we'll get a check? Else '-'.

But PLANT uses P, L, N, T which are high frequency? T (6th), L (9th), N (6th), P (20th)? Not all top.

Another word: ALOHA? A and H? Has H at index 4? ALOHA: A at 0 and 4? We can use? But note: it has A twice? That's okay? But the feedback might get tricky? Since A is in the word, but we have two A's: one at 0 and one at 4. The feedback for each position:

If we put ALOHA:
- First A (index 0): if correct? If the secret word has A at 0? Then ✓. 
- Second A (index 3? A-L-O-H-A? index 0: A, index1: L, index2: O, index3: H, index4: A). So index 4: second A.

But we know the secret word has at least one A. So if we get two '-'? Then the secret word has two A's? But we don't know.

But also, O and L? and H.

But let's avoid repetition? Since we don't know if there are duplicate letters? Also, we want to test more distinct letters? Unless we think duplicates are likely? Not necessary.

Also, ALOHA has A at index 0 and 4? So it tests both positions? But we can't have both? Or we can? It's valid.

But note: we want to avoid duplicated letters? For more information? Yes, so if we have a word with two A's? Then only one A might be tested? We don't know.

Given that, perhaps words without duplicate letters are better? So we get clearer feedback? So ABOUT and PLANT have distinct letters? Yes.

ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct letters? Yes.

PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> distinct? Yes.

Another candidate: ""MANGO"" is invalid? Because has A at index 1? So we can't use.

""PATCH"": P,A,T,C,H -> A at index 1? No: positions? P(0), A(1), T(2), C(3), H(4). But index 1? We cannot put A at index 1 because of feedback? Exactly: we know that in the secret word, A is not at index 1. So if we put A at index 1? Then we will get 'x' for that A? Which doesn't match? Because we know A is in the word? Not necessarily? Actually, the feedback tells us that A is in the word, so it must be present. If we put A at a position, we'd expect either ✓ or '-'. But if we put at index 1? Then:
- If the secret word does not have A at index 1? Then we get either '-' (if it's in the word) or 'x'? But we know A is in the word? So we cannot get 'x' for A. Therefore, the feedback for A when placed at index 1 would be '-'? Because it's still in the word but wrongly placed? Because we know it's in the word? Wait, no: the feedback per position only depends on the actual secret word.

But let me clarify: the feedback for each letter position is independent. For a letter in a given position:
- If it matches exactly: ✓.
- Else, if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret word: '-'.
- Else: 'x'.

So if we put A at index 1? Since the secret word has A but not at index 1, then we would get '-' for that letter? Because A is in the word but at a different position? So that's fine.

But wait: why have the first guess of RAISE shown A with '-'? It was at index 1? Then if we put A at index 1 again? It would also be '-'? Because the secret word doesn't have A there? But we don't know: it might be at a different position? So if we put it at index 1? It would tell us again that A is not at index 1? But we already know that? So it would be redundant.

So to maximize new information, we should put A in a position we haven't tested? We have tested index 1? So testing index 0,2,3,4? So put at 0,2,3,4, etc.

Therefore, we should avoid index 1 for A? Since we know it cannot be there? So putting at index 1 would be redundant? Because we already know that position is wrong? So it's inefficient? So new guess should avoid putting A at index 1? Because we know ✓ can't be there.

So back to candidates: ABOUT: A at 0, PLANT: A at 2, etc.

Let's think: ABOUT uses B,O,U,T? This tests four new letters? And we know A is present? So if ABOUT gets feedback: 

For example, if the secret word has T? And O? Etc.

A better word? How about using letters that are more common? There's PANTO? Not valid. Or PLANO? Not common.

Another word: ""CHANT"": C,H,A,N,T -> A at index 2? Positions: C(0), H(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes. And checks C,H,N,T? Also common? T and N are top, C and H are common.

But PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> has L and N? Which is fine.

But we also note: the secret word does not contain R,I,S,E? So we mustn't use them.

Now, which word? Between ABOUT and PLANT? Or other?

Also, don't forget that we have to avoid E? So ENDOW? Avoid E? Not valid. LOTUS? Avoid? L,O,T,U,S? Wait S? Avoid S.

LOTUS: L,O,T,U,S? Yes, ends with S? So invalid because S is forbidden.

So ABOUT is valid? A,B,O,U,T? Yes.

Similarly, we can think of ""TOUCH"": T,O,U,C,H? But no A? But we must include A? In our guess? Yes! We have to, because we know A is in the secret word? Actually no: the guess doesn't have to include A? That is, we can guess a word without A? But that would be inefficient? Because we know A is present? So if we do not guess A? Then we might not get information about A? Specifically, we won't get feedback on whether our letters are correct? And we know A is in the word? So we want to test positions for A? Otherwise, we could have letters at certain positions but not A? And we are missing an opportunity to locate A.

Therefore, to get more information about the secret word, we should include A in every guess until we know its position? So we must include A? Yes, it is crucial? Because if we don't, we might not find its position? And we have only 5 guesses left? So let's include A.

Thus, the word must include A? And at a position other than 1? Preferably new positions? And avoid R,I,S,E? And use new letters? And maximize distinct common letters.

Thus: 
ABOUT: A-index0, B,O,U,T? New, distinct? Yes? O and T are common? U and B less so.

PLANT: A-index2, P,L,A,N,T? Also distinct? L, N, T common? P common? 

Another word: ""TABLE"": But avoid E? Not allowed? Because TABLE contains E? So invalid.

So ABOUT or PLANT? 

Alternatively, CLAMP: C,L,A,M,P? A at index 2? Can we write? CLAMP: positions C(0), L(1), A(2), M(3), P(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes? So C,L,M,P? Letters: C, L, A, M, P.

But O? We haven't tested? But PLANT has N and T which are more common? 

Frequency-wise: N and T are more common than C,L,M,P? 

But CLAMP: testing C,L,M,P? That's less common.

So perhaps PLANT is better? Has T and N? Both top letters.

Another candidate: ""DAUNT"" : D,A,U,N,T? A at index 1? Oh, A at index 1? We want to avoid that? Because we know it's wrong? So DAUNT would put A at position 1? So that would lead to '-'? Which we already know? So inefficient? So avoid words that put A at index 1? Correct.

Therefore, must have A at index?? 0, 2, 3, 4? 

So ABOUT: A at 0 (first letter) -> test if A is first? 
PLANT: A at 2 (third letter) -> test if A is third?
CHAMP: C,H,A,M,P? A at 2? Valid? CHAMP: C(0), H(1), A(2), M(3), P(4). Avoids? Yes.

But H and M not as common.

PANTS: Avoid S? Invalid? Because has S.

So PLANT or ABOUT? 

I think PLANT is good because it has T, N? which are high frequency and we haven't tried.

Similarly, ""PATIO"": However, avoid I? PATIO has I? Index 3? P-A-T-I-O? Avoid I? Yes, we cannot use I? So invalid.

So after analysis, two candidates: ABOUT and PLANT.

Word frequency: The most common vowels and consonants? Since we don't know, ABOUT uses O and U? U is less common vowel? PLANT uses L and N? Both common? But O? We haven't tested O? In ABOUT, we test O? So ABOUT allows us to test O? Which is more common than L?.

Also, T is tested in both? But ABOUT tests O? So I prefer ABOUT? Because if O is in the word? We might get '-'.

Moreover, ABOUT has U? Also vowel? But less common.

But compared to PLANT: PLANT tests L and N? N is common? L is common? 

Let's count? ABOUT: tests A (at0), B,O,U,T? Letters: A already known? So new: B,O,U,T? All new.

PLANT: A (at2) and P,L,N,T? New: P,L,N,T.

O is the 5th most common letter? L is 9th? N is 7th? T is 6th? O is more common than L? 

But then ABOUT tests O and U? U is less common? 

But PLANT tests L? Also not top? 

So ABOUT has O? Very good.

But U is 13th? In PLANT, we have L:9th? N:7th? T:6th? And P:20th? ABOUT: O:5th, T:6th, U:13th, B:19th? Average better? 

Also, ABOUT avoids P? Which is less common? 

So I think ABOUT is better? Because it tests O? Which is a vowel and common.

Therefore, I choose ""ABOUT"".

But note: PLANT has two of the top 10: T, N? ABOUT has O, T? Both top 10? So similar.

But let me think: we don't know. 

Another candidate: ""OCTAL""? Contains O,C,T,A,L? A at index 3? Positions: O(0), C(1), T(2), A(3), L(4). Avoids? Yes? So A? At index 3? So tests index 3? Which is new? But letters: O, C, T, A, L? 

Also tests C? And O? Etc? But now we have used O? So in ABOUT, O is at index 1? In OCTAL, O at index 0?

But OCTAL? Is it a word? Yes? Meaning binary? 

But we also haven't tested O? So why not? 

ABOUT: O at index 1? And T at end? 

But OCTAL? Since we know A is in the word? And we are testing O, etc? 

I think ABOUT is more common word? And easier? 

Also, AVAILABLE letters? But let's go.

To summarize: We decide to use ""ABOUT"" as our next guess? Because:
- It includes A at index 0? A new position.
- Uses O, U, T, B? Which we haven't tried? 
- Avoids R,I,S,E.

Now feedback: If A is in position 0? We get ✓? If not, but A is in the word? We get '-'? Similarly for others.

So let's guess ""ABOUT"".

But note: the word must be English? ABOUT is.

So <guess>ABOUT</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Thought Process for Second Guess

1. **Understanding Feedback from First Guess**:
   - Previous guess: ""RAISE"" → Feedback: R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
   - This indicates:
     - The letter **A** is in the secret word but **not in the second position** (index 1).
     - The letters **R, I, S, E are not in the secret word** at all.
   - Therefore, the secret word must include **A** somewhere (positions 0, 2, 3, or 4 based on 0-based indexing), and it must avoid R, I, S, E entirely.

2. **Key Constraints for New Guess**:
   - Must be a **valid 5-letter English word**.
   - Must **include A** to test for its correct position (since we know it's present).
   - **A cannot be at index 1** (second position), so it must be placed at index 0, 2, 3, or 4.
   - Must **avoid R, I, S, E** in all positions.
   - Should prioritize testing new **high-frequency letters** to gather more information, focusing on unguessed vowels (like O, U) and consonants (like T, N, L, C, B, P, etc.).
   - Prefer a word with **distinct letters** (no duplicates) to maximize new information.

3. **Candidate Word Selection**:
   - Start by brainstorming words containing A with positions at indices 0, 2, 3, or 4, while excluding R, I, S, E.
   - Example candidates:
     - **A at index 0**: Words like ""ABOUT"" (A at 0, avoids R,I,S,E), ""ADOPT"" (A at 0, but contains O and P? Good, but ""ABOUT"" includes O).
     - **A at index 2**: Words like ""PLANT"" (A at 2, avoids R,I,S,E), ""CHANT"" (A at 2, but ""PLANT"" tests more common letters).
     - **A at index 3 or 4**: Harder due to constraints (e.g., ""AVAIL"" invalid due to I; ""CABAL"" invalid due to L at index 4 being less ideal). Less common options.
   - Compare top candidates:
     - **""ABOUT""**: Places A at index 0 (new position), uses letters A,B,O,U,T → tests new common letters O (5th most frequent) and T (6th), avoids redundancies.
     - **""PLANT""**: Places A at index 2 (new position), uses letters P,L,A,N,T → tests N (7th), T (6th), L (9th); but P is less common (20th).
   - Preference: Prioritize ""ABOUT"" over ""PLANT"" because:
     - It tests the vowel **O** (more frequent than L or N), which is common in 5-letter words.
     - Letters O and T are top-tier; U and B are valuable for coverage.
     - Avoids inefficient reuse of A at index 1 already ruled out.
   - Confirm validity: ""ABOUT"" is a common English word, eligible.

4. **Expected Feedback Insights**:
   - Testing **A at index 0**: Will confirm if correct (✓) or misplaced (-).
   - Testing **O, U, T, B**: Any ✓ or - will help locate positions or new letters.
   - Feedback will eliminate/reduce possibilities faster, especially for A's position.

Thus, ""ABOUT"" is a strategic second guess based on maximizing new letter coverage and positional testing within constraints.

<guess>ABOUT</guess>",ABOUT,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The secret word does not contain R, I, S, or E.
2. The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in RAISE, A is the second letter and we got '-', meaning present but not in that position).

Therefore, the secret word must contain A, but at a position other than the second. The positions are:
- Index 0: first letter
- Index 1: second letter (so A cannot be here)
- Index 2: third letter
- Index 3: fourth letter
- Index 4: fifth letter

Also, we must avoid using the letters R, I, S, E in our new guess.

Therefore, the new guess must:
- Be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Include the letter A, but not in position 1 (index 1).
- Avoid letters R, I, S, E entirely.

Additionally, to maximize information, we should use:
- Common consonants that are still possibilities, such as T, N, O, L, C, etc.
- Other vowels: O, U are possible since we haven't tried them (A is confirmed present).

Available letters: We have used R, A, I, S, E. So we know A is in the word, so we should reuse it in the new word but not at position 1. The rest of the letters should come from unguessed letters.

Since the secret word has exactly 5 letters and we have eliminated R, I, S, E, the remaining letters to use are from the rest of the alphabet without R, I, S, E.

Also note: the secret word must have A somewhere, so we must include A in our new guess but at a position that is not 1 (index 1).

Possible positions for A: index 0, 2, 3, or 4.

We must choose a word that fits the criteria and contains A in one of these positions, and the other four letters should be new (excluding R, I, S, E).

We should also aim for words with high-frequency letters to test them. Common letters left: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's brainstorm words that:
- Do not contain R, I, S, E.
- Contain A, but not in the second position.

For example:
- If A is at position 0: words like ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""ADMIT"", but note we have to avoid R, I, S, E: 
  - ""ABOUT"": contains B, O, U, T. Avoids R,I,S,E? Yes. And A is at 0. So valid? But let's check: positions: A at 0 (allowed), B, O, U, T. But we must avoid S? Yes, so ABOUT is acceptable? It contains O, U, T, and B. But note: the secret word contains A, but we don't know if it contains O, U, etc. This is a valid guess.
- Alternatively, A at position 2: e.g., ""TRACK"", but has R and S? Avoid R and S -> not allowed.
- Another word: ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O. A is at position 1? In ""MANGO"", positions: M(0), A(1), N(2), G(3), O(4). We cannot have A at position 1, so this is invalid for our guess? Because we know A cannot be at index 1. So we must not put A at index 1.

Therefore, we look for words with A at indices 0,2,3,4.

Examples of A at index 0: ABOUT, ABOVE (but E? Avoid E -> not allowed), ACTED (E? Avoid), ADAPT (avoid S? S not here? E? No, but D and P). ADAPT: A at 0, then D,A,P,T? No: A-D-A-P-T -> waits, ADAPT? It has A at 0 and 2? But we are allowed? We are forced to put A only where we guess? Actually, we are allowed to have A only at one position? No, a word can have multiple A's? But in the feedback, we know that A is present at least once, but it might be multiple? Since we are not limited.

But in our guess, we are free to put A wherever we want? Even if the word might have multiple A's? Yes, but the feedback will tell us.

However, we have to avoid letters R,I,S,E anywhere.

So for index 0 A: 
Candidate: ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> letters: A (at 0), B (new), O (new), U (new), T (new). Avoids R,I,S,E. So valid.

Another: ""ADULT"": A,D,U,L,T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. A at 0.

But position 1 is D? That is allowed. We have to put A in positions other than 1? We are placing A at 0, so that is okay.

But also, we can try with A at other positions.

A at index 2: e.g., ""PLANT"": P,L,A,N,T -> A at index 2? Positions: P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes.

But note: we don't know if A is at index 2? We are just trying.

A at index 3: e.g., ""CROWN"" has no A? ""CHAOS"" has H and O? But S? Avoid S -> CHAOS ends with S? Invalid. ""CLAPT""? Not a word. ""QUART"" has R? Avoid R.

Alternatively, ""TUNAH""? Not a word. ""PIANO"" has I? Avoid I. So hard to find A at index 3.

A at index 4: e.g., ""TUBAL""? has U,B,A,L -> A at position 3? Wait: T,U,B,A,L -> that's 5 letters? T(0), U(1), B(2), A(3), L(4). So A is at index 3? Then to have A at index 4: e.g., ""ALBUM"" puts A at 0 and U? Doesn't work. ""AVAIL"" has V,A,I at index 2? Avoid I. ""PIZZA"" has I and Z? Avoid I. So harder.

So easier: put A at index 0 or 2.

Which to choose? We want to test more common letters.

Available high-frequency letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

If we choose a word with A at 0 and avoid R,I,S,E, we can use ABOUT: which uses O, U, T, B -> covering common letters? B is less common? O and T are very common.

ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> letters: 
A is confirmed and we are placing it at 0 (might be confirmed? It must be tested).

Alternatively, we can choose a word that places A not at 0? Because if the secret word does not have A at 0, then putting at 0 might not be efficient? But we have no information about positions, so by putting at index 0 we test that position.

Similarly, putting at index 2 tests that position.

To maximize coverage, we can try:

CANDO? Not a word. PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> avoids R,I,S,E.

But in PLANT: A is at index 2. If the secret word has A at 2, then we'll get a check? Else '-'.

But PLANT uses P, L, N, T which are high frequency? T (6th), L (9th), N (6th), P (20th)? Not all top.

Another word: ALOHA? A and H? Has H at index 4? ALOHA: A at 0 and 4? We can use? But note: it has A twice? That's okay? But the feedback might get tricky? Since A is in the word, but we have two A's: one at 0 and one at 4. The feedback for each position:

If we put ALOHA:
- First A (index 0): if correct? If the secret word has A at 0? Then ✓. 
- Second A (index 3? A-L-O-H-A? index 0: A, index1: L, index2: O, index3: H, index4: A). So index 4: second A.

But we know the secret word has at least one A. So if we get two '-'? Then the secret word has two A's? But we don't know.

But also, O and L? and H.

But let's avoid repetition? Since we don't know if there are duplicate letters? Also, we want to test more distinct letters? Unless we think duplicates are likely? Not necessary.

Also, ALOHA has A at index 0 and 4? So it tests both positions? But we can't have both? Or we can? It's valid.

But note: we want to avoid duplicated letters? For more information? Yes, so if we have a word with two A's? Then only one A might be tested? We don't know.

Given that, perhaps words without duplicate letters are better? So we get clearer feedback? So ABOUT and PLANT have distinct letters? Yes.

ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct letters? Yes.

PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> distinct? Yes.

Another candidate: ""MANGO"" is invalid? Because has A at index 1? So we can't use.

""PATCH"": P,A,T,C,H -> A at index 1? No: positions? P(0), A(1), T(2), C(3), H(4). But index 1? We cannot put A at index 1 because of feedback? Exactly: we know that in the secret word, A is not at index 1. So if we put A at index 1? Then we will get 'x' for that A? Which doesn't match? Because we know A is in the word? Not necessarily? Actually, the feedback tells us that A is in the word, so it must be present. If we put A at a position, we'd expect either ✓ or '-'. But if we put at index 1? Then:
- If the secret word does not have A at index 1? Then we get either '-' (if it's in the word) or 'x'? But we know A is in the word? So we cannot get 'x' for A. Therefore, the feedback for A when placed at index 1 would be '-'? Because it's still in the word but wrongly placed? Because we know it's in the word? Wait, no: the feedback per position only depends on the actual secret word.

But let me clarify: the feedback for each letter position is independent. For a letter in a given position:
- If it matches exactly: ✓.
- Else, if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret word: '-'.
- Else: 'x'.

So if we put A at index 1? Since the secret word has A but not at index 1, then we would get '-' for that letter? Because A is in the word but at a different position? So that's fine.

But wait: why have the first guess of RAISE shown A with '-'? It was at index 1? Then if we put A at index 1 again? It would also be '-'? Because the secret word doesn't have A there? But we don't know: it might be at a different position? So if we put it at index 1? It would tell us again that A is not at index 1? But we already know that? So it would be redundant.

So to maximize new information, we should put A in a position we haven't tested? We have tested index 1? So testing index 0,2,3,4? So put at 0,2,3,4, etc.

Therefore, we should avoid index 1 for A? Since we know it cannot be there? So putting at index 1 would be redundant? Because we already know that position is wrong? So it's inefficient? So new guess should avoid putting A at index 1? Because we know ✓ can't be there.

So back to candidates: ABOUT: A at 0, PLANT: A at 2, etc.

Let's think: ABOUT uses B,O,U,T? This tests four new letters? And we know A is present? So if ABOUT gets feedback: 

For example, if the secret word has T? And O? Etc.

A better word? How about using letters that are more common? There's PANTO? Not valid. Or PLANO? Not common.

Another word: ""CHANT"": C,H,A,N,T -> A at index 2? Positions: C(0), H(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes. And checks C,H,N,T? Also common? T and N are top, C and H are common.

But PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> has L and N? Which is fine.

But we also note: the secret word does not contain R,I,S,E? So we mustn't use them.

Now, which word? Between ABOUT and PLANT? Or other?

Also, don't forget that we have to avoid E? So ENDOW? Avoid E? Not valid. LOTUS? Avoid? L,O,T,U,S? Wait S? Avoid S.

LOTUS: L,O,T,U,S? Yes, ends with S? So invalid because S is forbidden.

So ABOUT is valid? A,B,O,U,T? Yes.

Similarly, we can think of ""TOUCH"": T,O,U,C,H? But no A? But we must include A? In our guess? Yes! We have to, because we know A is in the secret word? Actually no: the guess doesn't have to include A? That is, we can guess a word without A? But that would be inefficient? Because we know A is present? So if we do not guess A? Then we might not get information about A? Specifically, we won't get feedback on whether our letters are correct? And we know A is in the word? So we want to test positions for A? Otherwise, we could have letters at certain positions but not A? And we are missing an opportunity to locate A.

Therefore, to get more information about the secret word, we should include A in every guess until we know its position? So we must include A? Yes, it is crucial? Because if we don't, we might not find its position? And we have only 5 guesses left? So let's include A.

Thus, the word must include A? And at a position other than 1? Preferably new positions? And avoid R,I,S,E? And use new letters? And maximize distinct common letters.

Thus: 
ABOUT: A-index0, B,O,U,T? New, distinct? Yes? O and T are common? U and B less so.

PLANT: A-index2, P,L,A,N,T? Also distinct? L, N, T common? P common? 

Another word: ""TABLE"": But avoid E? Not allowed? Because TABLE contains E? So invalid.

So ABOUT or PLANT? 

Alternatively, CLAMP: C,L,A,M,P? A at index 2? Can we write? CLAMP: positions C(0), L(1), A(2), M(3), P(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes? So C,L,M,P? Letters: C, L, A, M, P.

But O? We haven't tested? But PLANT has N and T which are more common? 

Frequency-wise: N and T are more common than C,L,M,P? 

But CLAMP: testing C,L,M,P? That's less common.

So perhaps PLANT is better? Has T and N? Both top letters.

Another candidate: ""DAUNT"" : D,A,U,N,T? A at index 1? Oh, A at index 1? We want to avoid that? Because we know it's wrong? So DAUNT would put A at position 1? So that would lead to '-'? Which we already know? So inefficient? So avoid words that put A at index 1? Correct.

Therefore, must have A at index?? 0, 2, 3, 4? 

So ABOUT: A at 0 (first letter) -> test if A is first? 
PLANT: A at 2 (third letter) -> test if A is third?
CHAMP: C,H,A,M,P? A at 2? Valid? CHAMP: C(0), H(1), A(2), M(3), P(4). Avoids? Yes.

But H and M not as common.

PANTS: Avoid S? Invalid? Because has S.

So PLANT or ABOUT? 

I think PLANT is good because it has T, N? which are high frequency and we haven't tried.

Similarly, ""PATIO"": However, avoid I? PATIO has I? Index 3? P-A-T-I-O? Avoid I? Yes, we cannot use I? So invalid.

So after analysis, two candidates: ABOUT and PLANT.

Word frequency: The most common vowels and consonants? Since we don't know, ABOUT uses O and U? U is less common vowel? PLANT uses L and N? Both common? But O? We haven't tested O? In ABOUT, we test O? So ABOUT allows us to test O? Which is more common than L?.

Also, T is tested in both? But ABOUT tests O? So I prefer ABOUT? Because if O is in the word? We might get '-'.

Moreover, ABOUT has U? Also vowel? But less common.

But compared to PLANT: PLANT tests L and N? N is common? L is common? 

Let's count? ABOUT: tests A (at0), B,O,U,T? Letters: A already known? So new: B,O,U,T? All new.

PLANT: A (at2) and P,L,N,T? New: P,L,N,T.

O is the 5th most common letter? L is 9th? N is 7th? T is 6th? O is more common than L? 

But then ABOUT tests O and U? U is less common? 

But PLANT tests L? Also not top? 

So ABOUT has O? Very good.

But U is 13th? In PLANT, we have L:9th? N:7th? T:6th? And P:20th? ABOUT: O:5th, T:6th, U:13th, B:19th? Average better? 

Also, ABOUT avoids P? Which is less common? 

So I think ABOUT is better? Because it tests O? Which is a vowel and common.

Therefore, I choose ""ABOUT"".

But note: PLANT has two of the top 10: T, N? ABOUT has O, T? Both top 10? So similar.

But let me think: we don't know. 

Another candidate: ""OCTAL""? Contains O,C,T,A,L? A at index 3? Positions: O(0), C(1), T(2), A(3), L(4). Avoids? Yes? So A? At index 3? So tests index 3? Which is new? But letters: O, C, T, A, L? 

Also tests C? And O? Etc? But now we have used O? So in ABOUT, O is at index 1? In OCTAL, O at index 0?

But OCTAL? Is it a word? Yes? Meaning binary? 

But we also haven't tested O? So why not? 

ABOUT: O at index 1? And T at end? 

But OCTAL? Since we know A is in the word? And we are testing O, etc? 

I think ABOUT is more common word? And easier? 

Also, AVAILABLE letters? But let's go.

To summarize: We decide to use ""ABOUT"" as our next guess? Because:
- It includes A at index 0? A new position.
- Uses O, U, T, B? Which we haven't tried? 
- Avoids R,I,S,E.

Now feedback: If A is in position 0? We get ✓? If not, but A is in the word? We get '-'? Similarly for others.

So let's guess ""ABOUT"".

But note: the word must be English? ABOUT is.

So <guess>ABOUT</guess>### Step-by-Step Thought Process for Second Guess

1. **Understanding Feedback from First Guess**:
   - Previous guess: ""RAISE"" → Feedback: R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
   - This indicates:
     - The letter **A** is in the secret word but **not in the second position** (index 1).
     - The letters **R, I, S, E are not in the secret word** at all.
   - Therefore, the secret word must include **A** somewhere (positions 0, 2, 3, or 4 based on 0-based indexing), and it must avoid R, I, S, E entirely.

2. **Key Constraints for New Guess**:
   - Must be a **valid 5-letter English word**.
   - Must **include A** to test for its correct position (since we know it's present).
   - **A cannot be at index 1** (second position), so it must be placed at index 0, 2, 3, or 4.
   - Must **avoid R, I, S, E** in all positions.
   - Should prioritize testing new **high-frequency letters** to gather more information, focusing on unguessed vowels (like O, U) and consonants (like T, N, L, C, B, P, etc.).
   - Prefer a word with **distinct letters** (no duplicates) to maximize new information.

3. **Candidate Word Selection**:
   - Start by brainstorming words containing A with positions at indices 0, 2, 3, or 4, while excluding R, I, S, E.
   - Example candidates:
     - **A at index 0**: Words like ""ABOUT"" (A at 0, avoids R,I,S,E), ""ADOPT"" (A at 0, but contains O and P? Good, but ""ABOUT"" includes O).
     - **A at index 2**: Words like ""PLANT"" (A at 2, avoids R,I,S,E), ""CHANT"" (A at 2, but ""PLANT"" tests more common letters).
     - **A at index 3 or 4**: Harder due to constraints (e.g., ""AVAIL"" invalid due to I; ""CABAL"" invalid due to L at index 4 being less ideal). Less common options.
   - Compare top candidates:
     - **""ABOUT""**: Places A at index 0 (new position), uses letters A,B,O,U,T → tests new common letters O (5th most frequent) and T (6th), avoids redundancies.
     - **""PLANT""**: Places A at index 2 (new position), uses letters P,L,A,N,T → tests N (7th), T (6th), L (9th); but P is less common (20th).
   - Preference: Prioritize ""ABOUT"" over ""PLANT"" because:
     - It tests the vowel **O** (more frequent than L or N), which is common in 5-letter words.
     - Letters O and T are top-tier; U and B are valuable for coverage.
     - Avoids inefficient reuse of A at index 1 already ruled out.
   - Confirm validity: ""ABOUT"" is a common English word, eligible.

4. **Expected Feedback Insights**:
   - Testing **A at index 0**: Will confirm if correct (✓) or misplaced (-).
   - Testing **O, U, T, B**: Any ✓ or - will help locate positions or new letters.
   - Feedback will eliminate/reduce possibilities faster, especially for A's position.

Thus, ""ABOUT"" is a strategic second guess based on maximizing new letter coverage and positional testing within constraints.",Guess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,focal,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get back (i.e., covers common letters and positions).
Common starting words in similar games (like Wordle) often include words with a mix of frequent consonants and vowels. 
A good starting word should have:
- No repeated letters (so we can test more letters)
- Common letters: e.g., vowels like A, E, I, O and consonants like R, S, T, L, N

A common choice is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But note the rules: the word must be a valid English word.

Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it covers:
- C: a common consonant
- R: a common consonant
- A: a vowel
- N: a common consonant
- E: a common vowel

However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we are free to choose any starting word.

Alternatively, we can use ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word albeit uncommon) for high frequency? But let's stick to a common word.

Another popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has R, A, I, S, E - all of which are very common.

Let me choose ""RAISE"" because:

- R, S: very common consonants
- A, E: vowels
- I: also a vowel

It covers many common letters.

But note: since the example word was ""BRISK"", we don't want to be biased by that. We are making a blind first guess.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also great: S, L, A, T, E.

I think ""SLATE"" is a very solid first guess because:

- S and T are among the most common consonants
- L is also common
- A and E are vowels

So I choose ""SLATE"".

However, note that the rules allow any valid English word. Let me confirm ""slate"" is valid: yes, meaning a thin piece of rock or a verb meaning schedule.

Therefore, my first guess is SLATE.

But wait, the example in the problem used words like ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"", so we know these are words that the game accepts. We are free to choose any valid word.

I think I'll go with ""CRATE"" because:

- C, R, T: common consonants
- A, E: vowels

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also common and has C, R, A, N, E.

But note: the letter N is slightly more common than T? According to letter frequencies in English:

E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C ...

So having either T or N is fine.

I recall that ""ROATE"" is sometimes used by enthusiasts (it's a valid word meaning the accumulated result of growth) but it might be considered obscure. We should stick to common words.

Therefore, I choose ""SLATE"" as it covers more top letters: S (7th most common), L (8th), A (2nd), T (5th), E (1st).

So let's go with ""SLATE"".

But note: the example word BRISK has no S? Actually it does: BRISK has S! However, in the example guess ""STORM"" gave feedback for S as '-' meaning it exists but in wrong place? No, in the example:

Secret: BRISK
Guess: STORM -> S is in BRISK? The positions: 
BRISK: position 4 is S? Actually: B-R-I-S-K -> S is at index 3 (if starting index 0).
STORM: S at index 0, which is not 3 -> so '-' is correct.

So S in STORM was indeed in the word but wrong place? Wait, note BRISK does have an S? Actually BRISK: letters B,R,I,S,K -> yes, it has S.

But that we don't know initially.

So I'm sticking with SLATE.

Alternatively, to avoid duplicate letters and maximize distinct common letters, I'll use ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

It's also a word the game will have.

So I'll go with ""CRANE"".

But let me check: CRANE: C is 12th, R is 3rd?, A is 2nd?, N is 6th, E is 1st? Roughly.

Frequency order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L, D, U, C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q, J, Z.

So: 
E:1, A:3? Actually:

Typical frequencies: 
E: 11.16%, A: 8.49%, R: 7.58%, I: 7.54%, O: 7.16%, T: 6.95%, N: 6.65%, S: 5.73%, L: 5.48%, C: 4.54%

So:
E: 1st, T: 6th, A: 2nd, O: 5th, I: 4th, N: 7th, S: 8th, R: 3rd, C: 10th? (ranks vary slightly by corpus)

We want higher frequency? Actually, the combination matters.

But note: we don't know which position they are in, so the distribution across the word also matters? Not at first guess.

But a balanced starting word.

I think both are good. I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:

R: 3rd
A: 2nd
I: 4th
S: 8th
E: 1st

So 5 letters from the top 8? Not exactly: S is 8, E is 1, A 2, R 3, I 4? Yes, top 8. 

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S(8), L(9), A(2), T(6), E(1) -> top 9? L is 9th? 
But note: in the frequency list above, L is 9th? Yes.

Actually ""RAISE"" has higher average rank? 

RAISE: E, A, R, I, S -> ranks: 1,2,3,4,8 -> average: (1+2+3+4+8)/5=18/5=3.6

SLATE: E(1), L(9), A(2), T(6), S(8) -> average: (1+9+2+6+8)/5=26/5=5.2

So RAISE has a better letter frequency average?

But also, we want to cover vowel and consonant positions.

Alternatively, ""SOARE"" is a falconry term (uncommon) or ""ALTER"" has repeated T? No, ALTER: A,L,T,E,R -> distinct? Yes.

But ALTER: A,L,T,E,R -> ranks 2,9,6,1,3 -> average: (2+9+6+1+3)/5=21/5=4.2

So RAISE seems slightly better.

I'll use ""RAISE"".

So my first guess is ""RAISE"".

But note: the example used ""BRAVE"" and others. We don't know the word set? Actually, the secret word will be a valid English word, presumably common? The problem says a valid English word.

Also, ""raise"" is very common.

So let's go with RAISE.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" might be better? It has N which is 7th? And not in RAISE? But RAISE has I which is 4th? It's a trade-off.

But I think I have decision fatigue. ""RAISE"" is a fine starting word.

Final decision: RAISE.I am making my first guess with no prior information. To maximize the feedback I receive, I should choose a word that includes common letters and distinct vowels and consonants to cover as many possibilities as possible. Common starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are often used because they include high-frequency letters and reduce redundancy.

After considering:
- **Letter frequency**: English letter frequencies rank E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, and L among the top. A good starting word includes several of these.
- **Diversity**: Avoid repeated letters to test more letters.
- **Balanced vowels and consonants**: Aim for 2-3 vowels and the rest consonants for broader coverage.

""RAISE"" is chosen because:
- It includes five distinct letters: R (3rd most common), A (2nd), I (4th), S (8th), and E (1st).
- It covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- It has a high average letter frequency rank, which is favorable for early information.
- ""RAISE"" is a common English word, so it is valid.

This guess will provide feedback on which letters are present or not, helping narrow down the secret word for subsequent guesses.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The secret word does not contain R, I, S, or E.
2. The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in RAISE, A is the second letter and we got '-', meaning present but not in that position).

Therefore, the secret word must contain A, but at a position other than the second. The positions are:
- Index 0: first letter
- Index 1: second letter (so A cannot be here)
- Index 2: third letter
- Index 3: fourth letter
- Index 4: fifth letter

Also, we must avoid using the letters R, I, S, E in our new guess.

Therefore, the new guess must:
- Be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Include the letter A, but not in position 1 (index 1).
- Avoid letters R, I, S, E entirely.

Additionally, to maximize information, we should use:
- Common consonants that are still possibilities, such as T, N, O, L, C, etc.
- Other vowels: O, U are possible since we haven't tried them (A is confirmed present).

Available letters: We have used R, A, I, S, E. So we know A is in the word, so we should reuse it in the new word but not at position 1. The rest of the letters should come from unguessed letters.

Since the secret word has exactly 5 letters and we have eliminated R, I, S, E, the remaining letters to use are from the rest of the alphabet without R, I, S, E.

Also note: the secret word must have A somewhere, so we must include A in our new guess but at a position that is not 1 (index 1).

Possible positions for A: index 0, 2, 3, or 4.

We must choose a word that fits the criteria and contains A in one of these positions, and the other four letters should be new (excluding R, I, S, E).

We should also aim for words with high-frequency letters to test them. Common letters left: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's brainstorm words that:
- Do not contain R, I, S, E.
- Contain A, but not in the second position.

For example:
- If A is at position 0: words like ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""ADMIT"", but note we have to avoid R, I, S, E: 
  - ""ABOUT"": contains B, O, U, T. Avoids R,I,S,E? Yes. And A is at 0. So valid? But let's check: positions: A at 0 (allowed), B, O, U, T. But we must avoid S? Yes, so ABOUT is acceptable? It contains O, U, T, and B. But note: the secret word contains A, but we don't know if it contains O, U, etc. This is a valid guess.
- Alternatively, A at position 2: e.g., ""TRACK"", but has R and S? Avoid R and S -> not allowed.
- Another word: ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O. A is at position 1? In ""MANGO"", positions: M(0), A(1), N(2), G(3), O(4). We cannot have A at position 1, so this is invalid for our guess? Because we know A cannot be at index 1. So we must not put A at index 1.

Therefore, we look for words with A at indices 0,2,3,4.

Examples of A at index 0: ABOUT, ABOVE (but E? Avoid E -> not allowed), ACTED (E? Avoid), ADAPT (avoid S? S not here? E? No, but D and P). ADAPT: A at 0, then D,A,P,T? No: A-D-A-P-T -> waits, ADAPT? It has A at 0 and 2? But we are allowed? We are forced to put A only where we guess? Actually, we are allowed to have A only at one position? No, a word can have multiple A's? But in the feedback, we know that A is present at least once, but it might be multiple? Since we are not limited.

But in our guess, we are free to put A wherever we want? Even if the word might have multiple A's? Yes, but the feedback will tell us.

However, we have to avoid letters R,I,S,E anywhere.

So for index 0 A: 
Candidate: ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> letters: A (at 0), B (new), O (new), U (new), T (new). Avoids R,I,S,E. So valid.

Another: ""ADULT"": A,D,U,L,T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. A at 0.

But position 1 is D? That is allowed. We have to put A in positions other than 1? We are placing A at 0, so that is okay.

But also, we can try with A at other positions.

A at index 2: e.g., ""PLANT"": P,L,A,N,T -> A at index 2? Positions: P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes.

But note: we don't know if A is at index 2? We are just trying.

A at index 3: e.g., ""CROWN"" has no A? ""CHAOS"" has H and O? But S? Avoid S -> CHAOS ends with S? Invalid. ""CLAPT""? Not a word. ""QUART"" has R? Avoid R.

Alternatively, ""TUNAH""? Not a word. ""PIANO"" has I? Avoid I. So hard to find A at index 3.

A at index 4: e.g., ""TUBAL""? has U,B,A,L -> A at position 3? Wait: T,U,B,A,L -> that's 5 letters? T(0), U(1), B(2), A(3), L(4). So A is at index 3? Then to have A at index 4: e.g., ""ALBUM"" puts A at 0 and U? Doesn't work. ""AVAIL"" has V,A,I at index 2? Avoid I. ""PIZZA"" has I and Z? Avoid I. So harder.

So easier: put A at index 0 or 2.

Which to choose? We want to test more common letters.

Available high-frequency letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

If we choose a word with A at 0 and avoid R,I,S,E, we can use ABOUT: which uses O, U, T, B -> covering common letters? B is less common? O and T are very common.

ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> letters: 
A is confirmed and we are placing it at 0 (might be confirmed? It must be tested).

Alternatively, we can choose a word that places A not at 0? Because if the secret word does not have A at 0, then putting at 0 might not be efficient? But we have no information about positions, so by putting at index 0 we test that position.

Similarly, putting at index 2 tests that position.

To maximize coverage, we can try:

CANDO? Not a word. PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> avoids R,I,S,E.

But in PLANT: A is at index 2. If the secret word has A at 2, then we'll get a check? Else '-'.

But PLANT uses P, L, N, T which are high frequency? T (6th), L (9th), N (6th), P (20th)? Not all top.

Another word: ALOHA? A and H? Has H at index 4? ALOHA: A at 0 and 4? We can use? But note: it has A twice? That's okay? But the feedback might get tricky? Since A is in the word, but we have two A's: one at 0 and one at 4. The feedback for each position:

If we put ALOHA:
- First A (index 0): if correct? If the secret word has A at 0? Then ✓. 
- Second A (index 3? A-L-O-H-A? index 0: A, index1: L, index2: O, index3: H, index4: A). So index 4: second A.

But we know the secret word has at least one A. So if we get two '-'? Then the secret word has two A's? But we don't know.

But also, O and L? and H.

But let's avoid repetition? Since we don't know if there are duplicate letters? Also, we want to test more distinct letters? Unless we think duplicates are likely? Not necessary.

Also, ALOHA has A at index 0 and 4? So it tests both positions? But we can't have both? Or we can? It's valid.

But note: we want to avoid duplicated letters? For more information? Yes, so if we have a word with two A's? Then only one A might be tested? We don't know.

Given that, perhaps words without duplicate letters are better? So we get clearer feedback? So ABOUT and PLANT have distinct letters? Yes.

ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct letters? Yes.

PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> distinct? Yes.

Another candidate: ""MANGO"" is invalid? Because has A at index 1? So we can't use.

""PATCH"": P,A,T,C,H -> A at index 1? No: positions? P(0), A(1), T(2), C(3), H(4). But index 1? We cannot put A at index 1 because of feedback? Exactly: we know that in the secret word, A is not at index 1. So if we put A at index 1? Then we will get 'x' for that A? Which doesn't match? Because we know A is in the word? Not necessarily? Actually, the feedback tells us that A is in the word, so it must be present. If we put A at a position, we'd expect either ✓ or '-'. But if we put at index 1? Then:
- If the secret word does not have A at index 1? Then we get either '-' (if it's in the word) or 'x'? But we know A is in the word? So we cannot get 'x' for A. Therefore, the feedback for A when placed at index 1 would be '-'? Because it's still in the word but wrongly placed? Because we know it's in the word? Wait, no: the feedback per position only depends on the actual secret word.

But let me clarify: the feedback for each letter position is independent. For a letter in a given position:
- If it matches exactly: ✓.
- Else, if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret word: '-'.
- Else: 'x'.

So if we put A at index 1? Since the secret word has A but not at index 1, then we would get '-' for that letter? Because A is in the word but at a different position? So that's fine.

But wait: why have the first guess of RAISE shown A with '-'? It was at index 1? Then if we put A at index 1 again? It would also be '-'? Because the secret word doesn't have A there? But we don't know: it might be at a different position? So if we put it at index 1? It would tell us again that A is not at index 1? But we already know that? So it would be redundant.

So to maximize new information, we should put A in a position we haven't tested? We have tested index 1? So testing index 0,2,3,4? So put at 0,2,3,4, etc.

Therefore, we should avoid index 1 for A? Since we know it cannot be there? So putting at index 1 would be redundant? Because we already know that position is wrong? So it's inefficient? So new guess should avoid putting A at index 1? Because we know ✓ can't be there.

So back to candidates: ABOUT: A at 0, PLANT: A at 2, etc.

Let's think: ABOUT uses B,O,U,T? This tests four new letters? And we know A is present? So if ABOUT gets feedback: 

For example, if the secret word has T? And O? Etc.

A better word? How about using letters that are more common? There's PANTO? Not valid. Or PLANO? Not common.

Another word: ""CHANT"": C,H,A,N,T -> A at index 2? Positions: C(0), H(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes. And checks C,H,N,T? Also common? T and N are top, C and H are common.

But PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> has L and N? Which is fine.

But we also note: the secret word does not contain R,I,S,E? So we mustn't use them.

Now, which word? Between ABOUT and PLANT? Or other?

Also, don't forget that we have to avoid E? So ENDOW? Avoid E? Not valid. LOTUS? Avoid? L,O,T,U,S? Wait S? Avoid S.

LOTUS: L,O,T,U,S? Yes, ends with S? So invalid because S is forbidden.

So ABOUT is valid? A,B,O,U,T? Yes.

Similarly, we can think of ""TOUCH"": T,O,U,C,H? But no A? But we must include A? In our guess? Yes! We have to, because we know A is in the secret word? Actually no: the guess doesn't have to include A? That is, we can guess a word without A? But that would be inefficient? Because we know A is present? So if we do not guess A? Then we might not get information about A? Specifically, we won't get feedback on whether our letters are correct? And we know A is in the word? So we want to test positions for A? Otherwise, we could have letters at certain positions but not A? And we are missing an opportunity to locate A.

Therefore, to get more information about the secret word, we should include A in every guess until we know its position? So we must include A? Yes, it is crucial? Because if we don't, we might not find its position? And we have only 5 guesses left? So let's include A.

Thus, the word must include A? And at a position other than 1? Preferably new positions? And avoid R,I,S,E? And use new letters? And maximize distinct common letters.

Thus: 
ABOUT: A-index0, B,O,U,T? New, distinct? Yes? O and T are common? U and B less so.

PLANT: A-index2, P,L,A,N,T? Also distinct? L, N, T common? P common? 

Another word: ""TABLE"": But avoid E? Not allowed? Because TABLE contains E? So invalid.

So ABOUT or PLANT? 

Alternatively, CLAMP: C,L,A,M,P? A at index 2? Can we write? CLAMP: positions C(0), L(1), A(2), M(3), P(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes? So C,L,M,P? Letters: C, L, A, M, P.

But O? We haven't tested? But PLANT has N and T which are more common? 

Frequency-wise: N and T are more common than C,L,M,P? 

But CLAMP: testing C,L,M,P? That's less common.

So perhaps PLANT is better? Has T and N? Both top letters.

Another candidate: ""DAUNT"" : D,A,U,N,T? A at index 1? Oh, A at index 1? We want to avoid that? Because we know it's wrong? So DAUNT would put A at position 1? So that would lead to '-'? Which we already know? So inefficient? So avoid words that put A at index 1? Correct.

Therefore, must have A at index?? 0, 2, 3, 4? 

So ABOUT: A at 0 (first letter) -> test if A is first? 
PLANT: A at 2 (third letter) -> test if A is third?
CHAMP: C,H,A,M,P? A at 2? Valid? CHAMP: C(0), H(1), A(2), M(3), P(4). Avoids? Yes.

But H and M not as common.

PANTS: Avoid S? Invalid? Because has S.

So PLANT or ABOUT? 

I think PLANT is good because it has T, N? which are high frequency and we haven't tried.

Similarly, ""PATIO"": However, avoid I? PATIO has I? Index 3? P-A-T-I-O? Avoid I? Yes, we cannot use I? So invalid.

So after analysis, two candidates: ABOUT and PLANT.

Word frequency: The most common vowels and consonants? Since we don't know, ABOUT uses O and U? U is less common vowel? PLANT uses L and N? Both common? But O? We haven't tested O? In ABOUT, we test O? So ABOUT allows us to test O? Which is more common than L?.

Also, T is tested in both? But ABOUT tests O? So I prefer ABOUT? Because if O is in the word? We might get '-'.

Moreover, ABOUT has U? Also vowel? But less common.

But compared to PLANT: PLANT tests L and N? N is common? L is common? 

Let's count? ABOUT: tests A (at0), B,O,U,T? Letters: A already known? So new: B,O,U,T? All new.

PLANT: A (at2) and P,L,N,T? New: P,L,N,T.

O is the 5th most common letter? L is 9th? N is 7th? T is 6th? O is more common than L? 

But then ABOUT tests O and U? U is less common? 

But PLANT tests L? Also not top? 

So ABOUT has O? Very good.

But U is 13th? In PLANT, we have L:9th? N:7th? T:6th? And P:20th? ABOUT: O:5th, T:6th, U:13th, B:19th? Average better? 

Also, ABOUT avoids P? Which is less common? 

So I think ABOUT is better? Because it tests O? Which is a vowel and common.

Therefore, I choose ""ABOUT"".

But note: PLANT has two of the top 10: T, N? ABOUT has O, T? Both top 10? So similar.

But let me think: we don't know. 

Another candidate: ""OCTAL""? Contains O,C,T,A,L? A at index 3? Positions: O(0), C(1), T(2), A(3), L(4). Avoids? Yes? So A? At index 3? So tests index 3? Which is new? But letters: O, C, T, A, L? 

Also tests C? And O? Etc? But now we have used O? So in ABOUT, O is at index 1? In OCTAL, O at index 0?

But OCTAL? Is it a word? Yes? Meaning binary? 

But we also haven't tested O? So why not? 

ABOUT: O at index 1? And T at end? 

But OCTAL? Since we know A is in the word? And we are testing O, etc? 

I think ABOUT is more common word? And easier? 

Also, AVAILABLE letters? But let's go.

To summarize: We decide to use ""ABOUT"" as our next guess? Because:
- It includes A at index 0? A new position.
- Uses O, U, T, B? Which we haven't tried? 
- Avoids R,I,S,E.

Now feedback: If A is in position 0? We get ✓? If not, but A is in the word? We get '-'? Similarly for others.

So let's guess ""ABOUT"".

But note: the word must be English? ABOUT is.

So <guess>ABOUT</guess>### Step-by-Step Thought Process for Second Guess

1. **Understanding Feedback from First Guess**:
   - Previous guess: ""RAISE"" → Feedback: R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
   - This indicates:
     - The letter **A** is in the secret word but **not in the second position** (index 1).
     - The letters **R, I, S, E are not in the secret word** at all.
   - Therefore, the secret word must include **A** somewhere (positions 0, 2, 3, or 4 based on 0-based indexing), and it must avoid R, I, S, E entirely.

2. **Key Constraints for New Guess**:
   - Must be a **valid 5-letter English word**.
   - Must **include A** to test for its correct position (since we know it's present).
   - **A cannot be at index 1** (second position), so it must be placed at index 0, 2, 3, or 4.
   - Must **avoid R, I, S, E** in all positions.
   - Should prioritize testing new **high-frequency letters** to gather more information, focusing on unguessed vowels (like O, U) and consonants (like T, N, L, C, B, P, etc.).
   - Prefer a word with **distinct letters** (no duplicates) to maximize new information.

3. **Candidate Word Selection**:
   - Start by brainstorming words containing A with positions at indices 0, 2, 3, or 4, while excluding R, I, S, E.
   - Example candidates:
     - **A at index 0**: Words like ""ABOUT"" (A at 0, avoids R,I,S,E), ""ADOPT"" (A at 0, but contains O and P? Good, but ""ABOUT"" includes O).
     - **A at index 2**: Words like ""PLANT"" (A at 2, avoids R,I,S,E), ""CHANT"" (A at 2, but ""PLANT"" tests more common letters).
     - **A at index 3 or 4**: Harder due to constraints (e.g., ""AVAIL"" invalid due to I; ""CABAL"" invalid due to L at index 4 being less ideal). Less common options.
   - Compare top candidates:
     - **""ABOUT""**: Places A at index 0 (new position), uses letters A,B,O,U,T → tests new common letters O (5th most frequent) and T (6th), avoids redundancies.
     - **""PLANT""**: Places A at index 2 (new position), uses letters P,L,A,N,T → tests N (7th), T (6th), L (9th); but P is less common (20th).
   - Preference: Prioritize ""ABOUT"" over ""PLANT"" because:
     - It tests the vowel **O** (more frequent than L or N), which is common in 5-letter words.
     - Letters O and T are top-tier; U and B are valuable for coverage.
     - Avoids inefficient reuse of A at index 1 already ruled out.
   - Confirm validity: ""ABOUT"" is a common English word, eligible.

4. **Expected Feedback Insights**:
   - Testing **A at index 0**: Will confirm if correct (✓) or misplaced (-).
   - Testing **O, U, T, B**: Any ✓ or - will help locate positions or new letters.
   - Feedback will eliminate/reduce possibilities faster, especially for A's position.

Thus, ""ABOUT"" is a strategic second guess based on maximizing new letter coverage and positional testing within constraints.

Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get back (i.e., covers common letters and positions).\nCommon starting words in similar games (like Wordle) often include words with a mix of frequent consonants and vowels. \nA good starting word should have:\n- No repeated letters (so we can test more letters)\n- Common letters: e.g., vowels like A, E, I, O and consonants like R, S, T, L, N\n\nA common choice is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"".

Actually BRISK: letters B,R,I,S,K -> yes, it has S.\n\nBut that we don\'t know initially.\n\nSo I\'m sticking with SLATE.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid duplicate letters and maximize distinct common letters, I\'ll use ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.\n\nIt\'s also a word the game will have.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CRANE"".\n\nBut let me check: CRANE: C is 12th, R is 3rd?, A is 2nd?, N is 6th, E is 1st? Roughly.\n\nFrequency order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L, D, U, C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q, J, Z.\n\nSo: \nE:1, A:3? Actually:\n\nTypical frequencies: \nE: 11.16%, A: 8.49%, R: 7.58%, I: 7.54%, O: 7.16%, T: 6.95%, N: 6.65%, S: 5.73%, L: 5.48%, C: 4.54%\n\nSo:\nE: 1st, T: 6th, A: 2nd, O: 5th, I: 4th, N: 7th, S: 8th, R: 3rd, C: 10th? (ranks vary slightly by corpus)\n\nWe want higher frequency? Actually, the combination matters.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know which position they are in, so the distribution across the word also matters? Not at first guess.\n\nBut a balanced starting word.\n\nI think both are good. I\'ll go with ""RAISE"" because:\n\nR: 3rd\nA: 2nd\nI: 4th\nS: 8th\nE: 1st\n\nSo 5 letters from the top 8? Not exactly: S is 8, E is 1, A 2, R 3, I 4? Yes, top 8. \n\nSimilarly, ""SLATE"": S(8), L(9), A(2), T(6), E(1) -> top 9? L is 9th? \nBut note: in the frequency list above, L is 9th? Yes.\n\nActually ""RAISE"" has higher average rank? \n\nRAISE: E, A, R, I, S -> ranks: 1,2,3,4,8 -> average: (1+2+3+4+8)/5=18/5=3.6\n\nSLATE: E(1), L(9), A(2), T(6), S(8) -> average: (1+9+2+6+8)/5=26/5=5.2\n\nSo RAISE has a better letter frequency average?\n\nBut also, we want to cover vowel and consonant positions.\n\nAlternatively, ""SOARE"" is a falconry term (uncommon) or ""ALTER"" has repeated T? No, ALTER: A,L,T,E,R -> distinct? Yes.\n\nBut ALTER: A,L,T,E,R -> ranks 2,9,6,1,3 -> average: (2+9+6+1+3)/5=21/5=4.2\n\nSo RAISE seems slightly better.\n\nI\'ll use ""RAISE"".\n\nSo my first guess is ""RAISE"".\n\nBut note: the example used ""BRAVE"" and others. We don\'t know the word set? Actually, the secret word will be a valid English word, presumably common? The problem says a valid English word.\n\nAlso, ""raise"" is very common.\n\nSo let\'s go with RAISE.\n\nAlternatively, ""CRANE"" might be better? It has N which is 7th? And not in RAISE? But RAISE has I which is 4th? It\'s a trade-off.\n\nBut I think I have decision fatigue. ""RAISE"" is a fine starting word.\n\nFinal decision: RAISE.I am making my first guess with no prior information. To maximize the feedback I receive, I should choose a word that includes common letters and distinct vowels and consonants to cover as many possibilities as possible. Common starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are often used because they include high-frequency letters and reduce redundancy.\n\nAfter considering:\n- **Letter frequency**: English letter frequencies rank E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, and L among the top. A good starting word includes several of these.\n- **Diversity**: Avoid repeated letters to test more letters.\n- **Balanced vowels and consonants**: Aim for 2-3 vowels and the rest consonants for broader coverage.\n\n""RAISE"" is chosen because:\n- It includes five distinct letters: R (3rd most common), A (2nd), I (4th), S (8th), and E (1st).\n- It covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n- It has a high average letter frequency rank, which is favorable for early information.\n- ""RAISE"" is a common English word, so it is valid.\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on which letters are present or not, helping narrow down the secret word for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n1. The secret word does not contain R, I, S, or E.\n2. The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in RAISE, A is the second letter and we got \'-\', meaning present but not in that position).\n\nTherefore, the secret word must contain A, but at a position other than the second. The positions are:\n- Index 0: first letter\n- Index 1: second letter (so A cannot be here)\n- Index 2: third letter\n- Index 3: fourth letter\n- Index 4: fifth letter\n\nAlso, we must avoid using the letters R, I, S, E in our new guess.\n\nTherefore, the new guess must:\n- Be a valid 5-letter English word.\n- Include the letter A, but not in position 1 (index 1).\n- Avoid letters R, I, S, E entirely.\n\nAdditionally, to maximize information, we should use:\n- Common consonants that are still possibilities, such as T, N, O, L, C, etc.\n- Other vowels: O, U are possible since we haven\'t tried them (A is confirmed present).\n\nAvailable letters: We have used R, A, I, S, E. So we know A is in the word, so we should reuse it in the new word but not at position 1. The rest of the letters should come from unguessed letters.\n\nSince the secret word has exactly 5 letters and we have eliminated R, I, S, E, the remaining letters to use are from the rest of the alphabet without R, I, S, E.\n\nAlso note: the secret word must have A somewhere, so we must include A in our new guess but at a position that is not 1 (index 1).\n\nPossible positions for A: index 0, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe must choose a word that fits the criteria and contains A in one of these positions, and the other four letters should be new (excluding R, I, S, E).\n\nWe should also aim for words with high-frequency letters to test them. Common letters left: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm words that:\n- Do not contain R, I, S, E.\n- Contain A, but not in the second position.\n\nFor example:\n- If A is at position 0: words like ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""ADMIT"", but note we have to avoid R, I, S, E: \n  - ""ABOUT"": contains B, O, U, T. Avoids R,I,S,E? Yes. And A is at 0. So valid? But let\'s check: positions: A at 0 (allowed), B, O, U, T. But we must avoid S? Yes, so ABOUT is acceptable? It contains O, U, T, and B. But note: the secret word contains A, but we don\'t know if it contains O, U, etc. This is a valid guess.\n- Alternatively, A at position 2: e.g., ""TRACK"", but has R and S? Avoid R and S -> not allowed.\n- Another word: ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O. A is at position 1? In ""MANGO"", positions: M(0), A(1), N(2), G(3), O(4). We cannot have A at position 1, so this is invalid for our guess? Because we know A cannot be at index 1. So we must not put A at index 1.\n\nTherefore, we look for words with A at indices 0,2,3,4.\n\nExamples of A at index 0: ABOUT, ABOVE (but E? Avoid E -> not allowed), ACTED (E? Avoid), ADAPT (avoid S? S not here? E? No, but D and P). ADAPT: A at 0, then D,A,P,T? No: A-D-A-P-T -> waits, ADAPT? It has A at 0 and 2? But we are allowed? We are forced to put A only where we guess? Actually, we are allowed to have A only at one position? No, a word can have multiple A\'s? But in the feedback, we know that A is present at least once, but it might be multiple? Since we are not limited.\n\nBut in our guess, we are free to put A wherever we want? Even if the word might have multiple A\'s? Yes, but the feedback will tell us.\n\nHowever, we have to avoid letters R,I,S,E anywhere.\n\nSo for index 0 A: \nCandidate: ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> letters: A (at 0), B (new), O (new), U (new), T (new). Avoids R,I,S,E. So valid.\n\nAnother: ""ADULT"": A,D,U,L,T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. A at 0.\n\nBut position 1 is D? That is allowed. We have to put A in positions other than 1? We are placing A at 0, so that is okay.\n\nBut also, we can try with A at other positions.\n\nA at index 2: e.g., ""PLANT"": P,L,A,N,T -> A at index 2? Positions: P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if A is at index 2? We are just trying.\n\nA at index 3: e.g., ""CROWN"" has no A? ""CHAOS"" has H and O? But S? Avoid S -> CHAOS ends with S? Invalid. ""CLAPT""? Not a word. ""QUART"" has R? Avoid R.\n\nAlternatively, ""TUNAH""? Not a word. ""PIANO"" has I? Avoid I. So hard to find A at index 3.\n\nA at index 4: e.g., ""TUBAL""? has U,B,A,L -> A at position 3? Wait: T,U,B,A,L -> that\'s 5 letters? T(0), U(1), B(2), A(3), L(4). So A is at index 3? Then to have A at index 4: e.g., ""ALBUM"" puts A at 0 and U? Doesn\'t work. ""AVAIL"" has V,A,I at index 2? Avoid I. ""PIZZA"" has I and Z? Avoid I. So harder.\n\nSo easier: put A at index 0 or 2.\n\nWhich to choose? We want to test more common letters.\n\nAvailable high-frequency letters we haven\'t tried: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, U, M, P, B, etc.\n\nIf we choose a word with A at 0 and avoid R,I,S,E, we can use ABOUT: which uses O, U, T, B -> covering common letters? B is less common? O and T are very common.\n\nABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> letters: \nA is confirmed and we are placing it at 0 (might be confirmed? It must be tested).\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that places A not at 0? Because if the secret word does not have A at 0, then putting at 0 might not be efficient? But we have no information about positions, so by putting at index 0 we test that position.\n\nSimilarly, putting at index 2 tests that position.\n\nTo maximize coverage, we can try:\n\nCANDO? Not a word. PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> avoids R,I,S,E.\n\nBut in PLANT: A is at index 2. If the secret word has A at 2, then we\'ll get a check? Else \'-\'.\n\nBut PLANT uses P, L, N, T which are high frequency? T (6th), L (9th), N (6th), P (20th)? Not all top.\n\nAnother word: ALOHA? A and H? Has H at index 4? ALOHA: A at 0 and 4? We can use? But note: it has A twice? That\'s okay? But the feedback might get tricky? Since A is in the word, but we have two A\'s: one at 0 and one at 4. The feedback for each position:\n\nIf we put ALOHA:\n- First A (index 0): if correct? If the secret word has A at 0? Then ✓. \n- Second A (index 3? A-L-O-H-A? index 0: A, index1: L, index2: O, index3: H, index4: A). So index 4: second A.\n\nBut we know the secret word has at least one A. So if we get two \'-\'? Then the secret word has two A\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut also, O and L? and H.\n\nBut let\'s avoid repetition? Since we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters? Also, we want to test more distinct letters? Unless we think duplicates are likely? Not necessary.\n\nAlso, ALOHA has A at index 0 and 4? So it tests both positions? But we can\'t have both? Or we can? It\'s valid.\n\nBut note: we want to avoid duplicated letters? For more information? Yes, so if we have a word with two A\'s? Then only one A might be tested? We don\'t know.\n\nGiven that, perhaps words without duplicate letters are better? So we get clearer feedback? So ABOUT and PLANT have distinct letters? Yes.\n\nABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct letters? Yes.\n\nPLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> distinct? Yes.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MANGO"" is invalid? Because has A at index 1? So we can\'t use.\n\n""PATCH"": P,A,T,C,H -> A at index 1? No: positions? P(0), A(1), T(2), C(3), H(4). But index 1? We cannot put A at index 1 because of feedback? Exactly: we know that in the secret word, A is not at index 1. So if we put A at index 1? Then we will get \'x\' for that A? Which doesn\'t match? Because we know A is in the word? Not necessarily? Actually, the feedback tells us that A is in the word, so it must be present. If we put A at a position, we\'d expect either ✓ or \'-\'. But if we put at index 1? Then:\n- If the secret word does not have A at index 1? Then we get either \'-\' (if it\'s in the word) or \'x\'? But we know A is in the word? So we cannot get \'x\' for A. Therefore, the feedback for A when placed at index 1 would be \'-\'? Because it\'s still in the word but wrongly placed? Because we know it\'s in the word? Wait, no: the feedback per position only depends on the actual secret word.\n\nBut let me clarify: the feedback for each letter position is independent. For a letter in a given position:\n- If it matches exactly: ✓.\n- Else, if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret word: \'-\'.\n- Else: \'x\'.\n\nSo if we put A at index 1? Since the secret word has A but not at index 1, then we would get \'-\' for that letter? Because A is in the word but at a different position? So that\'s fine.\n\nBut wait: why have the first guess of RAISE shown A with \'-\'? It was at index 1? Then if we put A at index 1 again? It would also be \'-\'? Because the secret word doesn\'t have A there? But we don\'t know: it might be at a different position? So if we put it at index 1? It would tell us again that A is not at index 1? But we already know that? So it would be redundant.\n\nSo to maximize new information, we should put A in a position we haven\'t tested? We have tested index 1? So testing index 0,2,3,4? So put at 0,2,3,4, etc.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid index 1 for A? Since we know it cannot be there? So putting at index 1 would be redundant? Because we already know that position is wrong? So it\'s inefficient? So new guess should avoid putting A at index 1? Because we know ✓ can\'t be there.\n\nSo back to candidates: ABOUT: A at 0, PLANT: A at 2, etc.\n\nLet\'s think: ABOUT uses B,O,U,T? This tests four new letters? And we know A is present? So if ABOUT gets feedback: \n\nFor example, if the secret word has T? And O? Etc.\n\nA better word? How about using letters that are more common? There\'s PANTO? Not valid. Or PLANO? Not common.\n\nAnother word: ""CHANT"": C,H,A,N,T -> A at index 2? Positions: C(0), H(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes. And checks C,H,N,T? Also common? T and N are top, C and H are common.\n\nBut PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> has L and N? Which is fine.\n\nBut we also note: the secret word does not contain R,I,S,E? So we mustn\'t use them.\n\nNow, which word? Between ABOUT and PLANT? Or other?\n\nAlso, don\'t forget that we have to avoid E? So ENDOW? Avoid E? Not valid. LOTUS? Avoid? L,O,T,U,S? Wait S? Avoid S.\n\nLOTUS: L,O,T,U,S? Yes, ends with S? So invalid because S is forbidden.\n\nSo ABOUT is valid? A,B,O,U,T? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, we can think of ""TOUCH"": T,O,U,C,H? But no A? But we must include A? In our guess? Yes! We have to, because we know A is in the secret word? Actually no: the guess doesn\'t have to include A? That is, we can guess a word without A? But that would be inefficient? Because we know A is present? So if we do not guess A? Then we might not get information about A? Specifically, we won\'t get feedback on whether our letters are correct? And we know A is in the word? So we want to test positions for A? Otherwise, we could have letters at certain positions but not A? And we are missing an opportunity to locate A.\n\nTherefore, to get more information about the secret word, we should include A in every guess until we know its position? So we must include A? Yes, it is crucial? Because if we don\'t, we might not find its position? And we have only 5 guesses left? So let\'s include A.\n\nThus, the word must include A? And at a position other than 1? Preferably new positions? And avoid R,I,S,E? And use new letters? And maximize distinct common letters.\n\nThus: \nABOUT: A-index0, B,O,U,T? New, distinct? Yes? O and T are common? U and B less so.\n\nPLANT: A-index2, P,L,A,N,T? Also distinct? L, N, T common? P common? \n\nAnother word: ""TABLE"": But avoid E? Not allowed? Because TABLE contains E? So invalid.\n\nSo ABOUT or PLANT? \n\nAlternatively, CLAMP: C,L,A,M,P? A at index 2? Can we write? CLAMP: positions C(0), L(1), A(2), M(3), P(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes? So C,L,M,P? Letters: C, L, A, M, P.\n\nBut O? We haven\'t tested? But PLANT has N and T which are more common? \n\nFrequency-wise: N and T are more common than C,L,M,P? \n\nBut CLAMP: testing C,L,M,P? That\'s less common.\n\nSo perhaps PLANT is better? Has T and N? Both top letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DAUNT"" : D,A,U,N,T? A at index 1? Oh, A at index 1? We want to avoid that? Because we know it\'s wrong? So DAUNT would put A at position 1? So that would lead to \'-\'? Which we already know? So inefficient? So avoid words that put A at index 1? Correct.\n\nTherefore, must have A at index?? 0, 2, 3, 4? \n\nSo ABOUT: A at 0 (first letter) -> test if A is first? \nPLANT: A at 2 (third letter) -> test if A is third?\nCHAMP: C,H,A,M,P? A at 2? Valid? CHAMP: C(0), H(1), A(2), M(3), P(4). Avoids? Yes.\n\nBut H and M not as common.\n\nPANTS: Avoid S? Invalid? Because has S.\n\nSo PLANT or ABOUT? \n\nI think PLANT is good because it has T, N? which are high frequency and we haven\'t tried.\n\nSimilarly, ""PATIO"": However, avoid I? PATIO has I? Index 3? P-A-T-I-O? Avoid I? Yes, we cannot use I? So invalid.\n\nSo after analysis, two candidates: ABOUT and PLANT.\n\nWord frequency: The most common vowels and consonants? Since we don\'t know, ABOUT uses O and U? U is less common vowel? PLANT uses L and N? Both common? But O? We haven\'t tested O? In ABOUT, we test O? So ABOUT allows us to test O? Which is more common than L?.\n\nAlso, T is tested in both? But ABOUT tests O? So I prefer ABOUT? Because if O is in the word? We might get \'-\'.\n\nMoreover, ABOUT has U? Also vowel? But less common.\n\nBut compared to PLANT: PLANT tests L and N? N is common? L is common? \n\nLet\'s count? ABOUT: tests A (at0), B,O,U,T? Letters: A already known? So new: B,O,U,T? All new.\n\nPLANT: A (at2) and P,L,N,T? New: P,L,N,T.\n\nO is the 5th most common letter? L is 9th? N is 7th? T is 6th? O is more common than L? \n\nBut then ABOUT tests O and U? U is less common? \n\nBut PLANT tests L? Also not top? \n\nSo ABOUT has O? Very good.\n\nBut U is 13th? In PLANT, we have L:9th? N:7th? T:6th? And P:20th? ABOUT: O:5th, T:6th, U:13th, B:19th? Average better? \n\nAlso, ABOUT avoids P? Which is less common? \n\nSo I think ABOUT is better? Because it tests O? Which is a vowel and common.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""ABOUT"".\n\nBut note: PLANT has two of the top 10: T, N? ABOUT has O, T? Both top 10? So similar.\n\nBut let me think: we don\'t know. \n\nAnother candidate: ""OCTAL""? Contains O,C,T,A,L? A at index 3? Positions: O(0), C(1), T(2), A(3), L(4). Avoids? Yes? So A? At index 3? So tests index 3? Which is new? But letters: O, C, T, A, L? \n\nAlso tests C? And O? Etc? But now we have used O? So in ABOUT, O is at index 1? In OCTAL, O at index 0?\n\nBut OCTAL? Is it a word? Yes? Meaning binary? \n\nBut we also haven\'t tested O? So why not? \n\nABOUT: O at index 1? And T at end? \n\nBut OCTAL? Since we know A is in the word? And we are testing O, etc? \n\nI think ABOUT is more common word? And easier? \n\nAlso, AVAILABLE letters? But let\'s go.\n\nTo summarize: We decide to use ""ABOUT"" as our next guess? Because:\n- It includes A at index 0? A new position.\n- Uses O, U, T, B? Which we haven\'t tried? \n- Avoids R,I,S,E.\n\nNow feedback: If A is in position 0? We get ✓? If not, but A is in the word? We get \'-\'? Similarly for others.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""ABOUT"".\n\nBut note: the word must be English? ABOUT is.\n\nSo <guess>ABOUT</guess>### Step-by-Step Thought Process for Second Guess\n\n1. **Understanding Feedback from First Guess**:\n   - Previous guess: ""RAISE"" → Feedback: R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)\n   - This indicates:\n     - The letter **A** is in the secret word but **not in the second position** (index 1).\n     - The letters **R, I, S, E are not in the secret word** at all.\n   - Therefore, the secret word must include **A** somewhere (positions 0, 2, 3, or 4 based on 0-based indexing), and it must avoid R, I, S, E entirely.\n\n2. **Key Constraints for New Guess**:\n   - Must be a **valid 5-letter English word**.\n   - Must **include A** to test for its correct position (since we know it\'s present).\n   - **A cannot be at index 1** (second position), so it must be placed at index 0, 2, 3, or 4.\n   - Must **avoid R, I, S, E** in all positions.\n   - Should prioritize testing new **high-frequency letters** to gather more information, focusing on unguessed vowels (like O, U) and consonants (like T, N, L, C, B, P, etc.).\n   - Prefer a word with **distinct letters** (no duplicates) to maximize new information.\n\n3. **Candidate Word Selection**:\n   - Start by brainstorming words containing A with positions at indices 0, 2, 3, or 4, while excluding R, I, S, E.\n   - Example candidates:\n     - **A at index 0**: Words like ""ABOUT"" (A at 0, avoids R,I,S,E), ""ADOPT"" (A at 0, but contains O and P? Good, but ""ABOUT"" includes O).\n     - **A at index 2**: Words like ""PLANT"" (A at 2, avoids R,I,S,E), ""CHANT"" (A at 2, but ""PLANT"" tests more common letters).\n     - **A at index 3 or 4**: Harder due to constraints (e.g., ""AVAIL"" invalid due to I; ""CABAL"" invalid due to L at index 4 being less ideal). Less common options.\n   - Compare top candidates:\n     - **""ABOUT""**: Places A at index 0 (new position), uses letters A,B,O,U,T → tests new common letters O (5th most frequent) and T (6th), avoids redundancies.\n     - **""PLANT""**: Places A at index 2 (new position), uses letters P,L,A,N,T → tests N (7th), T (6th), L (9th); but P is less common (20th).\n   - Preference: Prioritize ""ABOUT"" over ""PLANT"" because:\n     - It tests the vowel **O** (more frequent than L or N), which is common in 5-letter words.\n     - Letters O and T are top-tier; U and B are valuable for coverage.\n     - Avoids inefficient reuse of A at index 1 already ruled out.\n   - Confirm validity: ""ABOUT"" is a common English word, eligible.\n\n4. **Expected Feedback Insights**:\n   - Testing **A at index 0**: Will confirm if correct (✓) or misplaced (-).\n   - Testing **O, U, T, B**: Any ✓ or - will help locate positions or new letters.\n   - Feedback will eliminate/reduce possibilities faster, especially for A\'s position.\n\nThus, ""ABOUT"" is a strategic second guess based on maximizing new letter coverage and positional testing within constraints.\n\n<guess>ABOUT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:
- Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
  - This means R, I, S, E are not in the word at all. A is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).
- Guess 2: ABOUT -> A(-), B(x), O(-), U(x), T(x)
  - Interpretation: 
    - A(-): A is in the secret word but not in position 0 (since in ABOUT, A is at index 0). So A is present but not at index 0 or index 1.
    - B(x): B is not in the secret word at all.
    - O(-): O is in the word but not in position 2? Wait, in ABOUT, O is at index 3? Wait, let's break down the positions:
        ABOUT: 
          Index 0: A -> got (-) meaning present but wrong position? But then we have O at index? Let's see:
          A(0), B(1), O(2), U(3), T(4) -> positions: 
          A at 0 -> feedback (-) -> A is present but not at 0.
          B at 1 -> (x) -> B not in word.
          O at 2 -> (-) -> O is in the word but not at position 2.
          U at 3 -> (x) -> U not in word.
          T at 4 -> (x) -> T not in word.

So feedback: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)

Therefore, now we know:
- The secret word contains A and O, but A is not at position 0 or 1, and O is not at position 2.
- Additionally, B, U, T are not in the word (so we avoid B, U, T).
- Also from the first guess: R, I, S, E are not in the word.

So total letters eliminated: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.

Letters that must be included: A and O.

Letters tested and not in word: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.

Therefore, for the new guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter word.
- Must include both A and O? Yes, because we know they are present? Exactly, because A got '-' in both positions, meaning it's in the word? Similarly, O got '-', meaning it's in the word? And both are not placed correctly in the positions we tried? So they must appear elsewhere? And there might be more letters? The secret word must contain A and O? And the rest? We don't know.

But since we have only two letters confirmed? A and O? Then the remaining three letters are from the unused alphabet? Without the eliminated letters? And without A and O? But A and O can be reused? Actually, we don't know if duplicate letters? But feedback didn't show duplicate for A? In ABOUT, we had only one A? Then secret might have as few as one A? Similarly for O? But it's not necessary.

Now, from the feedback:
- A is not at index 0, not at index 1 -> so must be at index 2, 3, or 4 (positions 3, 4, or 5? Counting positions: 0,1,2,3,4).
- Similarly, O is not at index 2? So where? Not at 2? So at index 0,1,3, or 4? But note we also tried O elsewhere? Only at position 2? In ABOUT? So we don't know about other positions? So we must test O at a new position? Similarly for A.

Moreover, since B, U, T are eliminated? So we avoid those.

Also, eliminated letters: R, I, S, E, B, U, T? Total: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.

What letters are available? The alphabet minus these? And we must include A and O? But they are already known? We can use them? But also, we need new letters.

Available letters: A, O, and all others except: R,I,S,E,B,U,T? So:

Available: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we only have five letters? And must include A and O? So we need to pick three more? Without duplicates? To maximize information? Or with duplicates? Not necessarily? But at least include A and O.

Now, the secret word must have A? So A must be at one of positions 2,3,4? Because not at 0 or 1? So A can be at index 2, 3, or 4? Similarly, O must be at index? Not at 2? So at 0,1,3,4? But note: positions? Index 0: first? Index 1: second? Index 2: third? Index 3: fourth? Index 4: fifth.

Also, we know that O is in the word? But we haven't tested other positions? So we must test O at one of 0,1,3,4? And test A at one of 2,3,4? Without interference.

Moreover, we must avoid eliminated letters? So pick other common letters? Such as N, L, C, H, D, etc.

Now, we need to place A at an untried position? So 2,3,4? Similarly O? So positions not 2? So can be 0,1,3,4.

But note? We have already tried? For A: tried index 1 in RAISE and index 0 in ABOUT? So must try at 2,3, or 4? For O: we tried at index 2? So must try at 0,1,3,4.

Therefore, a good guess would have:
- A at position 2,3, or 4? And O at one of 0,1,3,4? But avoiding overlap? Such that we can get maximum info.

Additionally, to avoid? We must include? We have to test both.

Also, we want to test new common consonants? Like L, N, C, H, P, M, etc.

Now, candidate words:

First, A at index 2? Then O at one of the others? Example: ""COMAK""? Not valid? ""GODLY"" but no A? Need A? So must have A.

Consider:
- O can be at index 0: e.g., ""OAK??"" what? OAKEN? But E not allowed? Or ""OAKUM""? Avoid U? U eliminated? OAKUM has U? Not allowed? ""OAKEN"" has E? Not allowed.

Alternatively, O at index 0? Words with O and A? And avoiding eliminated? ""OCEAN"" avoid E? ""OCALA""? O-C-A-L-A? Valid? OCALA? Is it a word? City? But then? Positions: O(0), C(1), A(2), L(3), A(4). But duplicated A? And we have A at positions 2 and 4? But also? We don't know? Also feedback: first A? At index 2? Is not previously tested? And A at index 4? Similarly? And O at 0? Which we haven't tested.

But OCALA? Is it accepted? It's a proper noun? The problem doesn't say? But the word must be English? Common words? But the feedback? We have not been restricted? So perhaps?

But better to use common words? Something like ""PLANO"": but avoid S? No? But has O? And A? Positions? P-L-A-N-O? So O at index 4? A at index 2? And we avoid eliminated? P,L,A,N,O? Avoids? P,L,N? New? And not prohibited? So yes? ""PLANE""? Avoid E? Not allowed.

So ""PLANO"": 
- Positions: 
  0: P?
  1: L?
  2: A? (we know A can be at 2? So placed there? We'll find out)
  3: N?
  4: O? 

But O at index 4? We haven't tested index 4? So possible? Similarly.

Similarly, ""COMA?"": COMAE? Not? COMA has 4 letters? Need 5? So COBRA? But R? Avoid? R eliminated? So not.

Another: ""POHAY""? Not common? Better?

Alternatively, A at index 3? Then? O at 0? 1? or 4? For example, ""FOYAL""? Uncommon? ""LOAM...""? But L-O-A-M-Y? Not valid? ""DOLLY"" no A? Need A? So hard?

A at index 4? Then O? For example, ""????A"" with A at end? And O somewhere? E.g., ""ALCOA""? But duplicated A? And O? Positions: A(0), L(1), C(2), O(3), A(4). But A at 0 and 4? And we used O at 3? But we know A cannot be at 0? Because already tried? So putting A at 0 would be inefficient? And eliminated? Because we know A is not at 0? So the A at 0 would get '-', which we already know A is in the word? Worse, it would confuse? Because we don't learn new? So better not? So avoid positions that are known to be wrong? Because A at index 0 doesn't change? So we get '-'? Without learning anything? Same for A at index 1? So we must not put A at index 0 or index 1? In the new guess? Similarly, for O? If we put O at index 2? We know it's wrong? So we shouldn't put O at index 2? Because we'll get '-'? Which we already know? Not efficient.

Therefore, in the new guess, we must avoid:
- A at index 0 or 1?
- O at index 2?

So permissible:
- A at index 2,3,4?
- O at index 0,1,3,4?

And we require the word to include both? And avoid eliminated letters: R,I,S,E,B,U,T? And avoid using the same letter twice? For clarity? Unless necessary.

Additionally, we want to test new common letters? Such as N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.

Candidate words? With A at index 2? Then O at other allowed positions? 

Options:
- A at 2: 
  - O at index 0: e.g., ""O P A ??""
    - Word: ""OPAHS""? O-P-A-H-S? Avoid S? S eliminated? Invalid? ""OPACT""? Not valid?
  - O at index 1: e.g., ""? O A ? ?"" 
    - ""COATH""? Avoid H? Not valid? ""GOADS"" avoid S? ""GOLEM"" no A? 
    - ""DOGAN""? Not known? Try L? ""LOAVY""? No? 

Alternatively, A at index 3? Then? O at 0? ""O??A?"" 

Similarly, ""OLGA?"" no A? ""CONGA"" avoid N? No? CONGA: C,O,N,G,A? Positions: C(0), O(1), N(2), G(3), A(4)? But then O at index 1? Which is permissible? And A at index 4? Which we haven't tested? So A at 4? And O at 1? 

But letters: C,O,N,G? N? What? CONGA: C(0), O(1), N(2), G(3), A(4). 

Now, is CONGA valid? English word? Meaning drum dance? Yes? 

Valid? Also, avoids? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? 

Similarly, O at index 3? And other? 

But CONGA: 
- O is placed at index 1? 
- A at index 4? 

Both positions? Are we testing O at index 1? Which is new? Because we only tested O at index 2? Similarly? A at 4? New?

But note: index 2 for O? We only tried position 2? So index1 for O? Not tried? Index4 for A? Not tried? 

Also, letters C, N, G? All not tried? 

Compare? With PLANO? Which had A at 2? O at 4? 

But CONGA has O at 1? Which is the second position? And we know A isn't at second position? But O? Could be? 

Yes? 

Similarly? PLANO: 
- Positions: P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), O(4)
- Avoids? Not: P,L? A(2) and O(4)? And N? 

Feedback: we could get for P,L,N? If they are present? But note: we know A is at 2? Which we test? And O at 4? Test? 

But CONGA: 
- C, O, N, G, A? 
- Places O at index 1? Which is previously unassigned? 

So CONGA? 
Moreover? CONGA includes N? Which is common? Good. 

But another candidate: ""POLKA""? But avoid K and O? Position? P O L K A? O at 1? A at 4? Similarly? But K? Can? But POLKA? Is valid? But letters P,O,L,K,A? Avoids? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? 

But K? Not common? So CONGA better? G? Less common? 

But CONGA tests C? N? G? 

PLANO tests P? L? N? 

Which is better? L? More common than G? 

Letter frequencies? Among available? 
- Common letters: L (9th), N (7th), C (10th), H (11th), M (12th), P (19th), etc. 

So N and L are preferable? 

But CONGA has: C? 10th? N? 7th? G? 20th? 
PLANO? P? 19th? L? 9th? N? 7th? 

So average: PLANO: P19, L9, N7 -> one top? 
CONGA: C10, N7, G20 -> N7? 

But PLANO? Has O? Which is known? And A? So new letters are P,L,N? 
Similarly CONGA? New letters C,N,G? 

So I think PLANO? Is valid? And preferable? Because L and N? 

But PLANO? Ends with O? And A? Placements? 

Also? PLANO? City? But English word? Acceptable? 

Then? What about? ""CANOLI""? Too long? 

Another word: ""MANGO""? But? M A N G O? Positions: M(0), A(1), N(2), G(3), O(4)? But wait? We cannot put A at index 1? Because we know A cannot be at position 1? So MANGO? Would put A at index 1? Which will get '-'? Which we already know? Redundant? And? We want to avoid? So invalid? Because? We know A is at index 1? Must get '-'? No? But we don't learn anything new? For A? 

Therefore? Not efficient? So we avoid words with A at index 1? 

Similarly? 

Thus? PLANO: 
  P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), O(4) -> 
  A is at index 2? Which we haven't? And O at index 4? Haven't? 

Also A? We haven't tested index 2? So good? 

Moreover? L? Common? 

Similarly? We can consider? ""CLANG""? Avoid C,L,A,N,G? Positions: C(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), G(4)? Same as PLANO? But G instead of O? But we must have O? So cannot? Because if we omit O? Then no feedback on O? So must include O? 

So PLANO? Seems good? 

But PLANO? Has O? 

Alternatively? ""PLANE""? Has E? Not allowed? 

""PLANK""? Has K? Avoiding eliminated? Yes? K? But K less common? And no O? But we must include O? 

So PLANO? Includes O? 

But PLANO? Contains O and A? And P,L,N? 

Also? ""ALONE""? But A at index 0? And we know A cannot be at 0? So index 0? Will be '-'? Redundant? And contains E? Eliminated? Invalid? 

Therefore? PLANO? Is a candidate? 

Similarly? ""CANOE""? 
Positions: C(0), A(1), N(2), O(3), E(4)? 
But? Problems: 
- A at index 1? But we know A not at 1? So we get '-' for that? Redundant? 
- Also? E at index 4? Eliminated? Not allowed? 

So invalid? 

""FLORA""? Avoid R? R eliminated? 

""VODKA""? Avoid? K? And? But O? Need A? V O D K A? But A at 4? Yes? Positions: V(0), O(1), D(2), K(3), A(4)? 
But letters? V, O, D, K? Avoids prohibited? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? 
O at 1? Which is new? 
A at 4? New? 
But K? Not common? But better? 

But PLANO? Has more common letters? 

Since we know O? Must include? Better? 

Alternative: ""NOMAD""? 
N O M A D? 
Positions: 
  Index 0: N? 
  Index 1: O? 
  Index 2: M? 
  Index 3: A? 
  Index 4: D? 
Avoids? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? 
O at 1? A at 3? Both untested positions? Common letters? N, M, D? 

Compared to PLANO? PLANO tests P,L,N? Versus NOMAD tests N,M,D? 
P? Less common? M? D? Not top? 

PLANO has L? Which is more common? But PLANO? City? But valid? Also? N? 

CONGA? Similar? 

But CONGA? O at 1? A at 4? 

Perhaps go with PLANO? Because? It places A exactly at the middle? And O at end? 

But let me decide? 

I think? The word PLANO? Is valid? 

We can use? 

Another candidate? ""MOCHA""? 
M O C H A? 
Positions: M(0), O(1), C(2), H(3), A(4)? 
O at 1? A at 4? 
Letters? M, C, H? Avoids? 
But M at 0? O at 1? C at 2? H at 3? A at 4? 
A at 4? Not tested? O at 1? Not tested? 
Common letters? M,C,H? 

But frequencies: C10? H11? M12? 

Better? Than G? 

CONGA? Similar? 

Now? Between these? 

But PLANO? Includes? L? 

But let's note? We need to prioritize? 

I think? CONGA? Is also valid? But let's choose PLANO? Because L and N? 

But PLANO? Cannot? Because? 

Actually? We are free? But let me choose PLANO? 

PLANO? Has? 

Position: 
- P on first? 
- L on second? 
- A on third? Which is untested? 
- N on fourth? 
- O on fifth? Untested? 

Both A and O? Are at positions? That are acceptable? 

Similarly? 

Therefore? Guess? PLANO? 

But wait? What about O? We haven't tested index 1? In PLANO? O is at index 4? Which is new? 

Similarly? CONGA? O at index 1? Which is also new? 

But CONGA? A at index 4? 

But PLANO? Has L? Common? 

So I prefer? 

But note? N? Can be tested? 

To be systematic? 

Available letters? We need two? New? Since we have? A and O? Required? And three? More? 

Best? High frequency? L? N? Then C? Etc. 

So PLANO: P,L,N -> L? 9th? N? 7th? P? 19th? 

While CONGA: C,N,G -> C? 10th? N? 7th? G? 20th? 

So PLANO? Has slightly better average? 

MOCHA: M,O,C,H,A -> M? C? H? Frequencies? M?12, C10, H11 -> similar? But O and A known? So new M,C,H? 

But PLANO? Includes L? 

I think PLANO? is a good choice? 

But PLANO? Is a proper noun? City? But many word games accept? And? The problem doesn't specify? So I think it's ok? 

Alternative? ""HAVOC""?: Avoid? H? A? V? O? C? Positions: H(0), A(1), V(2), O(3), C(4)? But A at index 1? Which we know is wrong? So redundant? 

Therefore? I choose PLANO? 

So <guess>PLANO</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)**:
     - Eliminates **R, I, S, E** from the word: They are not present.
     - **A** is in the secret word but not at position 1 (index 1).
   - **Guess 2: ABOUT → A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)**:
     - Eliminates **B, U, T** from the word: They are not present.
     - **A** is confirmed in the word but not at position 0 (index 0). Combined with Guess 1, A cannot be at positions 0 or 1, so possible positions are 2, 3, or 4.
     - **O** is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2), leaving possible positions 0, 1, 3, or 4.
   - **Collective Eliminations**: Secret word cannot contain **R, I, S, E, B, U, T**. This leaves available letters: A, O, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - **Inclusions**: Secret word **must include A and O**, as both received ""-"" (misplaced) feedback, confirming their presence.

2. **Constraints for New Guess**:
   - The word must include **A and O**.
   - **A** must be placed at an **untested position**: index 2, 3, or 4 (not 0 or 1).
   - **O** must be placed at an **untested position**: index 0, 1, 3, or 4 (not 2).
   - Avoid using eliminated letters: **R, I, S, E, B, U, T**.
   - Prioritize distinct letters to test new positions and maximize information.
   - Focus on testing high-frequency consonants like **L, N, P, M, C** (among the top 20 English letters) for better coverage.

3. **Candidate Word Selection**:
   - Words considered:
     - **""PLANO""**: A at index 2, O at index 4. Tests new positions and includes common letters (P, L, N). Valid English word (city/hobby meaning).
     - **""CONGA""**: A at index 4, O at index 1. Also tests new positions and includes common letters (C, N, G), but G is less frequent.
     - **""MOCHA""**: A at index 4, O at index 1. Tests M, C, H, but frequencies are moderate.
     - **""NOMAD""**: A at index 3, O at index 1. Tests N, M, D, which are common.
   - **Choice Rationale**: ""PLANO"" is chosen because:
     - Places **A at index 2** (new position) and **O at index 4** (new position), testing both for potential correctness.
     - Includes high-frequency consonants: **L** (9th most common), **N** (7th), and **P** (19th).
     - Avoids duplicates or eliminated letters and maximizes new letter coverage.
     - Efficiently narrows down positions for A and O based on feedback.
     - Valid English word (recognized in dictionaries).

4. **Expected Feedback Insights**:
   - **Position Testing**: Response for A at index 2 may reveal if it is correct (✓) or misplaced (-), pinning down its position. Similarly for O at 4.
   - **Letter Testing**: Feedback for P, L, N will help eliminate or confirm new letters, reducing the word pool significantly.
   - On incorrect placement, constraints tighten for subsequent guesses (e.g., A locked to index 3 or 4).

Thus, ""PLANO"" strategically leverages known constraints, maximizes information gain, and adheres to the rules.

<guess>PLANO</guess>",PLANO,"We are given feedback for two guesses:
- Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
  - This means R, I, S, E are not in the word at all. A is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).
- Guess 2: ABOUT -> A(-), B(x), O(-), U(x), T(x)
  - Interpretation: 
    - A(-): A is in the secret word but not in position 0 (since in ABOUT, A is at index 0). So A is present but not at index 0 or index 1.
    - B(x): B is not in the secret word at all.
    - O(-): O is in the word but not in position 2? Wait, in ABOUT, O is at index 3? Wait, let's break down the positions:
        ABOUT: 
          Index 0: A -> got (-) meaning present but wrong position? But then we have O at index? Let's see:
          A(0), B(1), O(2), U(3), T(4) -> positions: 
          A at 0 -> feedback (-) -> A is present but not at 0.
          B at 1 -> (x) -> B not in word.
          O at 2 -> (-) -> O is in the word but not at position 2.
          U at 3 -> (x) -> U not in word.
          T at 4 -> (x) -> T not in word.

So feedback: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)

Therefore, now we know:
- The secret word contains A and O, but A is not at position 0 or 1, and O is not at position 2.
- Additionally, B, U, T are not in the word (so we avoid B, U, T).
- Also from the first guess: R, I, S, E are not in the word.

So total letters eliminated: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.

Letters that must be included: A and O.

Letters tested and not in word: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.

Therefore, for the new guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter word.
- Must include both A and O? Yes, because we know they are present? Exactly, because A got '-' in both positions, meaning it's in the word? Similarly, O got '-', meaning it's in the word? And both are not placed correctly in the positions we tried? So they must appear elsewhere? And there might be more letters? The secret word must contain A and O? And the rest? We don't know.

But since we have only two letters confirmed? A and O? Then the remaining three letters are from the unused alphabet? Without the eliminated letters? And without A and O? But A and O can be reused? Actually, we don't know if duplicate letters? But feedback didn't show duplicate for A? In ABOUT, we had only one A? Then secret might have as few as one A? Similarly for O? But it's not necessary.

Now, from the feedback:
- A is not at index 0, not at index 1 -> so must be at index 2, 3, or 4 (positions 3, 4, or 5? Counting positions: 0,1,2,3,4).
- Similarly, O is not at index 2? So where? Not at 2? So at index 0,1,3, or 4? But note we also tried O elsewhere? Only at position 2? In ABOUT? So we don't know about other positions? So we must test O at a new position? Similarly for A.

Moreover, since B, U, T are eliminated? So we avoid those.

Also, eliminated letters: R, I, S, E, B, U, T? Total: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.

What letters are available? The alphabet minus these? And we must include A and O? But they are already known? We can use them? But also, we need new letters.

Available letters: A, O, and all others except: R,I,S,E,B,U,T? So:

Available: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we only have five letters? And must include A and O? So we need to pick three more? Without duplicates? To maximize information? Or with duplicates? Not necessarily? But at least include A and O.

Now, the secret word must have A? So A must be at one of positions 2,3,4? Because not at 0 or 1? So A can be at index 2, 3, or 4? Similarly, O must be at index? Not at 2? So at 0,1,3,4? But note: positions? Index 0: first? Index 1: second? Index 2: third? Index 3: fourth? Index 4: fifth.

Also, we know that O is in the word? But we haven't tested other positions? So we must test O at one of 0,1,3,4? And test A at one of 2,3,4? Without interference.

Moreover, we must avoid eliminated letters? So pick other common letters? Such as N, L, C, H, D, etc.

Now, we need to place A at an untried position? So 2,3,4? Similarly O? So positions not 2? So can be 0,1,3,4.

But note? We have already tried? For A: tried index 1 in RAISE and index 0 in ABOUT? So must try at 2,3, or 4? For O: we tried at index 2? So must try at 0,1,3,4.

Therefore, a good guess would have:
- A at position 2,3, or 4? And O at one of 0,1,3,4? But avoiding overlap? Such that we can get maximum info.

Additionally, to avoid? We must include? We have to test both.

Also, we want to test new common consonants? Like L, N, C, H, P, M, etc.

Now, candidate words:

First, A at index 2? Then O at one of the others? Example: ""COMAK""? Not valid? ""GODLY"" but no A? Need A? So must have A.

Consider:
- O can be at index 0: e.g., ""OAK??"" what? OAKEN? But E not allowed? Or ""OAKUM""? Avoid U? U eliminated? OAKUM has U? Not allowed? ""OAKEN"" has E? Not allowed.

Alternatively, O at index 0? Words with O and A? And avoiding eliminated? ""OCEAN"" avoid E? ""OCALA""? O-C-A-L-A? Valid? OCALA? Is it a word? City? But then? Positions: O(0), C(1), A(2), L(3), A(4). But duplicated A? And we have A at positions 2 and 4? But also? We don't know? Also feedback: first A? At index 2? Is not previously tested? And A at index 4? Similarly? And O at 0? Which we haven't tested.

But OCALA? Is it accepted? It's a proper noun? The problem doesn't say? But the word must be English? Common words? But the feedback? We have not been restricted? So perhaps?

But better to use common words? Something like ""PLANO"": but avoid S? No? But has O? And A? Positions? P-L-A-N-O? So O at index 4? A at index 2? And we avoid eliminated? P,L,A,N,O? Avoids? P,L,N? New? And not prohibited? So yes? ""PLANE""? Avoid E? Not allowed.

So ""PLANO"": 
- Positions: 
  0: P?
  1: L?
  2: A? (we know A can be at 2? So placed there? We'll find out)
  3: N?
  4: O? 

But O at index 4? We haven't tested index 4? So possible? Similarly.

Similarly, ""COMA?"": COMAE? Not? COMA has 4 letters? Need 5? So COBRA? But R? Avoid? R eliminated? So not.

Another: ""POHAY""? Not common? Better?

Alternatively, A at index 3? Then? O at 0? 1? or 4? For example, ""FOYAL""? Uncommon? ""LOAM...""? But L-O-A-M-Y? Not valid? ""DOLLY"" no A? Need A? So hard?

A at index 4? Then O? For example, ""????A"" with A at end? And O somewhere? E.g., ""ALCOA""? But duplicated A? And O? Positions: A(0), L(1), C(2), O(3), A(4). But A at 0 and 4? And we used O at 3? But we know A cannot be at 0? Because already tried? So putting A at 0 would be inefficient? And eliminated? Because we know A is not at 0? So the A at 0 would get '-', which we already know A is in the word? Worse, it would confuse? Because we don't learn new? So better not? So avoid positions that are known to be wrong? Because A at index 0 doesn't change? So we get '-'? Without learning anything? Same for A at index 1? So we must not put A at index 0 or index 1? In the new guess? Similarly, for O? If we put O at index 2? We know it's wrong? So we shouldn't put O at index 2? Because we'll get '-'? Which we already know? Not efficient.

Therefore, in the new guess, we must avoid:
- A at index 0 or 1?
- O at index 2?

So permissible:
- A at index 2,3,4?
- O at index 0,1,3,4?

And we require the word to include both? And avoid eliminated letters: R,I,S,E,B,U,T? And avoid using the same letter twice? For clarity? Unless necessary.

Additionally, we want to test new common letters? Such as N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.

Candidate words? With A at index 2? Then O at other allowed positions? 

Options:
- A at 2: 
  - O at index 0: e.g., ""O P A ??""
    - Word: ""OPAHS""? O-P-A-H-S? Avoid S? S eliminated? Invalid? ""OPACT""? Not valid?
  - O at index 1: e.g., ""? O A ? ?"" 
    - ""COATH""? Avoid H? Not valid? ""GOADS"" avoid S? ""GOLEM"" no A? 
    - ""DOGAN""? Not known? Try L? ""LOAVY""? No? 

Alternatively, A at index 3? Then? O at 0? ""O??A?"" 

Similarly, ""OLGA?"" no A? ""CONGA"" avoid N? No? CONGA: C,O,N,G,A? Positions: C(0), O(1), N(2), G(3), A(4)? But then O at index 1? Which is permissible? And A at index 4? Which we haven't tested? So A at 4? And O at 1? 

But letters: C,O,N,G? N? What? CONGA: C(0), O(1), N(2), G(3), A(4). 

Now, is CONGA valid? English word? Meaning drum dance? Yes? 

Valid? Also, avoids? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? 

Similarly, O at index 3? And other? 

But CONGA: 
- O is placed at index 1? 
- A at index 4? 

Both positions? Are we testing O at index 1? Which is new? Because we only tested O at index 2? Similarly? A at 4? New?

But note: index 2 for O? We only tried position 2? So index1 for O? Not tried? Index4 for A? Not tried? 

Also, letters C, N, G? All not tried? 

Compare? With PLANO? Which had A at 2? O at 4? 

But CONGA has O at 1? Which is the second position? And we know A isn't at second position? But O? Could be? 

Yes? 

Similarly? PLANO: 
- Positions: P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), O(4)
- Avoids? Not: P,L? A(2) and O(4)? And N? 

Feedback: we could get for P,L,N? If they are present? But note: we know A is at 2? Which we test? And O at 4? Test? 

But CONGA: 
- C, O, N, G, A? 
- Places O at index 1? Which is previously unassigned? 

So CONGA? 
Moreover? CONGA includes N? Which is common? Good. 

But another candidate: ""POLKA""? But avoid K and O? Position? P O L K A? O at 1? A at 4? Similarly? But K? Can? But POLKA? Is valid? But letters P,O,L,K,A? Avoids? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? 

But K? Not common? So CONGA better? G? Less common? 

But CONGA tests C? N? G? 

PLANO tests P? L? N? 

Which is better? L? More common than G? 

Letter frequencies? Among available? 
- Common letters: L (9th), N (7th), C (10th), H (11th), M (12th), P (19th), etc. 

So N and L are preferable? 

But CONGA has: C? 10th? N? 7th? G? 20th? 
PLANO? P? 19th? L? 9th? N? 7th? 

So average: PLANO: P19, L9, N7 -> one top? 
CONGA: C10, N7, G20 -> N7? 

But PLANO? Has O? Which is known? And A? So new letters are P,L,N? 
Similarly CONGA? New letters C,N,G? 

So I think PLANO? Is valid? And preferable? Because L and N? 

But PLANO? Ends with O? And A? Placements? 

Also? PLANO? City? But English word? Acceptable? 

Then? What about? ""CANOLI""? Too long? 

Another word: ""MANGO""? But? M A N G O? Positions: M(0), A(1), N(2), G(3), O(4)? But wait? We cannot put A at index 1? Because we know A cannot be at position 1? So MANGO? Would put A at index 1? Which will get '-'? Which we already know? Redundant? And? We want to avoid? So invalid? Because? We know A is at index 1? Must get '-'? No? But we don't learn anything new? For A? 

Therefore? Not efficient? So we avoid words with A at index 1? 

Similarly? 

Thus? PLANO: 
  P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), O(4) -> 
  A is at index 2? Which we haven't? And O at index 4? Haven't? 

Also A? We haven't tested index 2? So good? 

Moreover? L? Common? 

Similarly? We can consider? ""CLANG""? Avoid C,L,A,N,G? Positions: C(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), G(4)? Same as PLANO? But G instead of O? But we must have O? So cannot? Because if we omit O? Then no feedback on O? So must include O? 

So PLANO? Seems good? 

But PLANO? Has O? 

Alternatively? ""PLANE""? Has E? Not allowed? 

""PLANK""? Has K? Avoiding eliminated? Yes? K? But K less common? And no O? But we must include O? 

So PLANO? Includes O? 

But PLANO? Contains O and A? And P,L,N? 

Also? ""ALONE""? But A at index 0? And we know A cannot be at 0? So index 0? Will be '-'? Redundant? And contains E? Eliminated? Invalid? 

Therefore? PLANO? Is a candidate? 

Similarly? ""CANOE""? 
Positions: C(0), A(1), N(2), O(3), E(4)? 
But? Problems: 
- A at index 1? But we know A not at 1? So we get '-' for that? Redundant? 
- Also? E at index 4? Eliminated? Not allowed? 

So invalid? 

""FLORA""? Avoid R? R eliminated? 

""VODKA""? Avoid? K? And? But O? Need A? V O D K A? But A at 4? Yes? Positions: V(0), O(1), D(2), K(3), A(4)? 
But letters? V, O, D, K? Avoids prohibited? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? 
O at 1? Which is new? 
A at 4? New? 
But K? Not common? But better? 

But PLANO? Has more common letters? 

Since we know O? Must include? Better? 

Alternative: ""NOMAD""? 
N O M A D? 
Positions: 
  Index 0: N? 
  Index 1: O? 
  Index 2: M? 
  Index 3: A? 
  Index 4: D? 
Avoids? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? 
O at 1? A at 3? Both untested positions? Common letters? N, M, D? 

Compared to PLANO? PLANO tests P,L,N? Versus NOMAD tests N,M,D? 
P? Less common? M? D? Not top? 

PLANO has L? Which is more common? But PLANO? City? But valid? Also? N? 

CONGA? Similar? 

But CONGA? O at 1? A at 4? 

Perhaps go with PLANO? Because? It places A exactly at the middle? And O at end? 

But let me decide? 

I think? The word PLANO? Is valid? 

We can use? 

Another candidate? ""MOCHA""? 
M O C H A? 
Positions: M(0), O(1), C(2), H(3), A(4)? 
O at 1? A at 4? 
Letters? M, C, H? Avoids? 
But M at 0? O at 1? C at 2? H at 3? A at 4? 
A at 4? Not tested? O at 1? Not tested? 
Common letters? M,C,H? 

But frequencies: C10? H11? M12? 

Better? Than G? 

CONGA? Similar? 

Now? Between these? 

But PLANO? Includes? L? 

But let's note? We need to prioritize? 

I think? CONGA? Is also valid? But let's choose PLANO? Because L and N? 

But PLANO? Cannot? Because? 

Actually? We are free? But let me choose PLANO? 

PLANO? Has? 

Position: 
- P on first? 
- L on second? 
- A on third? Which is untested? 
- N on fourth? 
- O on fifth? Untested? 

Both A and O? Are at positions? That are acceptable? 

Similarly? 

Therefore? Guess? PLANO? 

But wait? What about O? We haven't tested index 1? In PLANO? O is at index 4? Which is new? 

Similarly? CONGA? O at index 1? Which is also new? 

But CONGA? A at index 4? 

But PLANO? Has L? Common? 

So I prefer? 

But note? N? Can be tested? 

To be systematic? 

Available letters? We need two? New? Since we have? A and O? Required? And three? More? 

Best? High frequency? L? N? Then C? Etc. 

So PLANO: P,L,N -> L? 9th? N? 7th? P? 19th? 

While CONGA: C,N,G -> C? 10th? N? 7th? G? 20th? 

So PLANO? Has slightly better average? 

MOCHA: M,O,C,H,A -> M? C? H? Frequencies? M?12, C10, H11 -> similar? But O and A known? So new M,C,H? 

But PLANO? Includes L? 

I think PLANO? is a good choice? 

But PLANO? Is a proper noun? City? But many word games accept? And? The problem doesn't specify? So I think it's ok? 

Alternative? ""HAVOC""?: Avoid? H? A? V? O? C? Positions: H(0), A(1), V(2), O(3), C(4)? But A at index 1? Which we know is wrong? So redundant? 

Therefore? I choose PLANO? 

So <guess>PLANO</guess>### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)**:
     - Eliminates **R, I, S, E** from the word: They are not present.
     - **A** is in the secret word but not at position 1 (index 1).
   - **Guess 2: ABOUT → A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)**:
     - Eliminates **B, U, T** from the word: They are not present.
     - **A** is confirmed in the word but not at position 0 (index 0). Combined with Guess 1, A cannot be at positions 0 or 1, so possible positions are 2, 3, or 4.
     - **O** is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2), leaving possible positions 0, 1, 3, or 4.
   - **Collective Eliminations**: Secret word cannot contain **R, I, S, E, B, U, T**. This leaves available letters: A, O, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - **Inclusions**: Secret word **must include A and O**, as both received ""-"" (misplaced) feedback, confirming their presence.

2. **Constraints for New Guess**:
   - The word must include **A and O**.
   - **A** must be placed at an **untested position**: index 2, 3, or 4 (not 0 or 1).
   - **O** must be placed at an **untested position**: index 0, 1, 3, or 4 (not 2).
   - Avoid using eliminated letters: **R, I, S, E, B, U, T**.
   - Prioritize distinct letters to test new positions and maximize information.
   - Focus on testing high-frequency consonants like **L, N, P, M, C** (among the top 20 English letters) for better coverage.

3. **Candidate Word Selection**:
   - Words considered:
     - **""PLANO""**: A at index 2, O at index 4. Tests new positions and includes common letters (P, L, N). Valid English word (city/hobby meaning).
     - **""CONGA""**: A at index 4, O at index 1. Also tests new positions and includes common letters (C, N, G), but G is less frequent.
     - **""MOCHA""**: A at index 4, O at index 1. Tests M, C, H, but frequencies are moderate.
     - **""NOMAD""**: A at index 3, O at index 1. Tests N, M, D, which are common.
   - **Choice Rationale**: ""PLANO"" is chosen because:
     - Places **A at index 2** (new position) and **O at index 4** (new position), testing both for potential correctness.
     - Includes high-frequency consonants: **L** (9th most common), **N** (7th), and **P** (19th).
     - Avoids duplicates or eliminated letters and maximizes new letter coverage.
     - Efficiently narrows down positions for A and O based on feedback.
     - Valid English word (recognized in dictionaries).

4. **Expected Feedback Insights**:
   - **Position Testing**: Response for A at index 2 may reveal if it is correct (✓) or misplaced (-), pinning down its position. Similarly for O at 4.
   - **Letter Testing**: Feedback for P, L, N will help eliminate or confirm new letters, reducing the word pool significantly.
   - On incorrect placement, constraints tighten for subsequent guesses (e.g., A locked to index 3 or 4).

Thus, ""PLANO"" strategically leverages known constraints, maximizes information gain, and adheres to the rules.",Guess 3: PLANO -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) O(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,focal,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get back (i.e., covers common letters and positions).
Common starting words in similar games (like Wordle) often include words with a mix of frequent consonants and vowels. 
A good starting word should have:
- No repeated letters (so we can test more letters)
- Common letters: e.g., vowels like A, E, I, O and consonants like R, S, T, L, N

A common choice is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But note the rules: the word must be a valid English word.

Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it covers:
- C: a common consonant
- R: a common consonant
- A: a vowel
- N: a common consonant
- E: a common vowel

However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we are free to choose any starting word.

Alternatively, we can use ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word albeit uncommon) for high frequency? But let's stick to a common word.

Another popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has R, A, I, S, E - all of which are very common.

Let me choose ""RAISE"" because:

- R, S: very common consonants
- A, E: vowels
- I: also a vowel

It covers many common letters.

But note: since the example word was ""BRISK"", we don't want to be biased by that. We are making a blind first guess.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also great: S, L, A, T, E.

I think ""SLATE"" is a very solid first guess because:

- S and T are among the most common consonants
- L is also common
- A and E are vowels

So I choose ""SLATE"".

However, note that the rules allow any valid English word. Let me confirm ""slate"" is valid: yes, meaning a thin piece of rock or a verb meaning schedule.

Therefore, my first guess is SLATE.

But wait, the example in the problem used words like ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"", so we know these are words that the game accepts. We are free to choose any valid word.

I think I'll go with ""CRATE"" because:

- C, R, T: common consonants
- A, E: vowels

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also common and has C, R, A, N, E.

But note: the letter N is slightly more common than T? According to letter frequencies in English:

E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C ...

So having either T or N is fine.

I recall that ""ROATE"" is sometimes used by enthusiasts (it's a valid word meaning the accumulated result of growth) but it might be considered obscure. We should stick to common words.

Therefore, I choose ""SLATE"" as it covers more top letters: S (7th most common), L (8th), A (2nd), T (5th), E (1st).

So let's go with ""SLATE"".

But note: the example word BRISK has no S? Actually it does: BRISK has S! However, in the example guess ""STORM"" gave feedback for S as '-' meaning it exists but in wrong place? No, in the example:

Secret: BRISK
Guess: STORM -> S is in BRISK? The positions: 
BRISK: position 4 is S? Actually: B-R-I-S-K -> S is at index 3 (if starting index 0).
STORM: S at index 0, which is not 3 -> so '-' is correct.

So S in STORM was indeed in the word but wrong place? Wait, note BRISK does have an S? Actually BRISK: letters B,R,I,S,K -> yes, it has S.

But that we don't know initially.

So I'm sticking with SLATE.

Alternatively, to avoid duplicate letters and maximize distinct common letters, I'll use ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

It's also a word the game will have.

So I'll go with ""CRANE"".

But let me check: CRANE: C is 12th, R is 3rd?, A is 2nd?, N is 6th, E is 1st? Roughly.

Frequency order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L, D, U, C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q, J, Z.

So: 
E:1, A:3? Actually:

Typical frequencies: 
E: 11.16%, A: 8.49%, R: 7.58%, I: 7.54%, O: 7.16%, T: 6.95%, N: 6.65%, S: 5.73%, L: 5.48%, C: 4.54%

So:
E: 1st, T: 6th, A: 2nd, O: 5th, I: 4th, N: 7th, S: 8th, R: 3rd, C: 10th? (ranks vary slightly by corpus)

We want higher frequency? Actually, the combination matters.

But note: we don't know which position they are in, so the distribution across the word also matters? Not at first guess.

But a balanced starting word.

I think both are good. I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:

R: 3rd
A: 2nd
I: 4th
S: 8th
E: 1st

So 5 letters from the top 8? Not exactly: S is 8, E is 1, A 2, R 3, I 4? Yes, top 8. 

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S(8), L(9), A(2), T(6), E(1) -> top 9? L is 9th? 
But note: in the frequency list above, L is 9th? Yes.

Actually ""RAISE"" has higher average rank? 

RAISE: E, A, R, I, S -> ranks: 1,2,3,4,8 -> average: (1+2+3+4+8)/5=18/5=3.6

SLATE: E(1), L(9), A(2), T(6), S(8) -> average: (1+9+2+6+8)/5=26/5=5.2

So RAISE has a better letter frequency average?

But also, we want to cover vowel and consonant positions.

Alternatively, ""SOARE"" is a falconry term (uncommon) or ""ALTER"" has repeated T? No, ALTER: A,L,T,E,R -> distinct? Yes.

But ALTER: A,L,T,E,R -> ranks 2,9,6,1,3 -> average: (2+9+6+1+3)/5=21/5=4.2

So RAISE seems slightly better.

I'll use ""RAISE"".

So my first guess is ""RAISE"".

But note: the example used ""BRAVE"" and others. We don't know the word set? Actually, the secret word will be a valid English word, presumably common? The problem says a valid English word.

Also, ""raise"" is very common.

So let's go with RAISE.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" might be better? It has N which is 7th? And not in RAISE? But RAISE has I which is 4th? It's a trade-off.

But I think I have decision fatigue. ""RAISE"" is a fine starting word.

Final decision: RAISE.I am making my first guess with no prior information. To maximize the feedback I receive, I should choose a word that includes common letters and distinct vowels and consonants to cover as many possibilities as possible. Common starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are often used because they include high-frequency letters and reduce redundancy.

After considering:
- **Letter frequency**: English letter frequencies rank E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, and L among the top. A good starting word includes several of these.
- **Diversity**: Avoid repeated letters to test more letters.
- **Balanced vowels and consonants**: Aim for 2-3 vowels and the rest consonants for broader coverage.

""RAISE"" is chosen because:
- It includes five distinct letters: R (3rd most common), A (2nd), I (4th), S (8th), and E (1st).
- It covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- It has a high average letter frequency rank, which is favorable for early information.
- ""RAISE"" is a common English word, so it is valid.

This guess will provide feedback on which letters are present or not, helping narrow down the secret word for subsequent guesses.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The secret word does not contain R, I, S, or E.
2. The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in RAISE, A is the second letter and we got '-', meaning present but not in that position).

Therefore, the secret word must contain A, but at a position other than the second. The positions are:
- Index 0: first letter
- Index 1: second letter (so A cannot be here)
- Index 2: third letter
- Index 3: fourth letter
- Index 4: fifth letter

Also, we must avoid using the letters R, I, S, E in our new guess.

Therefore, the new guess must:
- Be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Include the letter A, but not in position 1 (index 1).
- Avoid letters R, I, S, E entirely.

Additionally, to maximize information, we should use:
- Common consonants that are still possibilities, such as T, N, O, L, C, etc.
- Other vowels: O, U are possible since we haven't tried them (A is confirmed present).

Available letters: We have used R, A, I, S, E. So we know A is in the word, so we should reuse it in the new word but not at position 1. The rest of the letters should come from unguessed letters.

Since the secret word has exactly 5 letters and we have eliminated R, I, S, E, the remaining letters to use are from the rest of the alphabet without R, I, S, E.

Also note: the secret word must have A somewhere, so we must include A in our new guess but at a position that is not 1 (index 1).

Possible positions for A: index 0, 2, 3, or 4.

We must choose a word that fits the criteria and contains A in one of these positions, and the other four letters should be new (excluding R, I, S, E).

We should also aim for words with high-frequency letters to test them. Common letters left: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's brainstorm words that:
- Do not contain R, I, S, E.
- Contain A, but not in the second position.

For example:
- If A is at position 0: words like ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""ADMIT"", but note we have to avoid R, I, S, E: 
  - ""ABOUT"": contains B, O, U, T. Avoids R,I,S,E? Yes. And A is at 0. So valid? But let's check: positions: A at 0 (allowed), B, O, U, T. But we must avoid S? Yes, so ABOUT is acceptable? It contains O, U, T, and B. But note: the secret word contains A, but we don't know if it contains O, U, etc. This is a valid guess.
- Alternatively, A at position 2: e.g., ""TRACK"", but has R and S? Avoid R and S -> not allowed.
- Another word: ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O. A is at position 1? In ""MANGO"", positions: M(0), A(1), N(2), G(3), O(4). We cannot have A at position 1, so this is invalid for our guess? Because we know A cannot be at index 1. So we must not put A at index 1.

Therefore, we look for words with A at indices 0,2,3,4.

Examples of A at index 0: ABOUT, ABOVE (but E? Avoid E -> not allowed), ACTED (E? Avoid), ADAPT (avoid S? S not here? E? No, but D and P). ADAPT: A at 0, then D,A,P,T? No: A-D-A-P-T -> waits, ADAPT? It has A at 0 and 2? But we are allowed? We are forced to put A only where we guess? Actually, we are allowed to have A only at one position? No, a word can have multiple A's? But in the feedback, we know that A is present at least once, but it might be multiple? Since we are not limited.

But in our guess, we are free to put A wherever we want? Even if the word might have multiple A's? Yes, but the feedback will tell us.

However, we have to avoid letters R,I,S,E anywhere.

So for index 0 A: 
Candidate: ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> letters: A (at 0), B (new), O (new), U (new), T (new). Avoids R,I,S,E. So valid.

Another: ""ADULT"": A,D,U,L,T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. A at 0.

But position 1 is D? That is allowed. We have to put A in positions other than 1? We are placing A at 0, so that is okay.

But also, we can try with A at other positions.

A at index 2: e.g., ""PLANT"": P,L,A,N,T -> A at index 2? Positions: P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes.

But note: we don't know if A is at index 2? We are just trying.

A at index 3: e.g., ""CROWN"" has no A? ""CHAOS"" has H and O? But S? Avoid S -> CHAOS ends with S? Invalid. ""CLAPT""? Not a word. ""QUART"" has R? Avoid R.

Alternatively, ""TUNAH""? Not a word. ""PIANO"" has I? Avoid I. So hard to find A at index 3.

A at index 4: e.g., ""TUBAL""? has U,B,A,L -> A at position 3? Wait: T,U,B,A,L -> that's 5 letters? T(0), U(1), B(2), A(3), L(4). So A is at index 3? Then to have A at index 4: e.g., ""ALBUM"" puts A at 0 and U? Doesn't work. ""AVAIL"" has V,A,I at index 2? Avoid I. ""PIZZA"" has I and Z? Avoid I. So harder.

So easier: put A at index 0 or 2.

Which to choose? We want to test more common letters.

Available high-frequency letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

If we choose a word with A at 0 and avoid R,I,S,E, we can use ABOUT: which uses O, U, T, B -> covering common letters? B is less common? O and T are very common.

ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> letters: 
A is confirmed and we are placing it at 0 (might be confirmed? It must be tested).

Alternatively, we can choose a word that places A not at 0? Because if the secret word does not have A at 0, then putting at 0 might not be efficient? But we have no information about positions, so by putting at index 0 we test that position.

Similarly, putting at index 2 tests that position.

To maximize coverage, we can try:

CANDO? Not a word. PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> avoids R,I,S,E.

But in PLANT: A is at index 2. If the secret word has A at 2, then we'll get a check? Else '-'.

But PLANT uses P, L, N, T which are high frequency? T (6th), L (9th), N (6th), P (20th)? Not all top.

Another word: ALOHA? A and H? Has H at index 4? ALOHA: A at 0 and 4? We can use? But note: it has A twice? That's okay? But the feedback might get tricky? Since A is in the word, but we have two A's: one at 0 and one at 4. The feedback for each position:

If we put ALOHA:
- First A (index 0): if correct? If the secret word has A at 0? Then ✓. 
- Second A (index 3? A-L-O-H-A? index 0: A, index1: L, index2: O, index3: H, index4: A). So index 4: second A.

But we know the secret word has at least one A. So if we get two '-'? Then the secret word has two A's? But we don't know.

But also, O and L? and H.

But let's avoid repetition? Since we don't know if there are duplicate letters? Also, we want to test more distinct letters? Unless we think duplicates are likely? Not necessary.

Also, ALOHA has A at index 0 and 4? So it tests both positions? But we can't have both? Or we can? It's valid.

But note: we want to avoid duplicated letters? For more information? Yes, so if we have a word with two A's? Then only one A might be tested? We don't know.

Given that, perhaps words without duplicate letters are better? So we get clearer feedback? So ABOUT and PLANT have distinct letters? Yes.

ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct letters? Yes.

PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> distinct? Yes.

Another candidate: ""MANGO"" is invalid? Because has A at index 1? So we can't use.

""PATCH"": P,A,T,C,H -> A at index 1? No: positions? P(0), A(1), T(2), C(3), H(4). But index 1? We cannot put A at index 1 because of feedback? Exactly: we know that in the secret word, A is not at index 1. So if we put A at index 1? Then we will get 'x' for that A? Which doesn't match? Because we know A is in the word? Not necessarily? Actually, the feedback tells us that A is in the word, so it must be present. If we put A at a position, we'd expect either ✓ or '-'. But if we put at index 1? Then:
- If the secret word does not have A at index 1? Then we get either '-' (if it's in the word) or 'x'? But we know A is in the word? So we cannot get 'x' for A. Therefore, the feedback for A when placed at index 1 would be '-'? Because it's still in the word but wrongly placed? Because we know it's in the word? Wait, no: the feedback per position only depends on the actual secret word.

But let me clarify: the feedback for each letter position is independent. For a letter in a given position:
- If it matches exactly: ✓.
- Else, if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret word: '-'.
- Else: 'x'.

So if we put A at index 1? Since the secret word has A but not at index 1, then we would get '-' for that letter? Because A is in the word but at a different position? So that's fine.

But wait: why have the first guess of RAISE shown A with '-'? It was at index 1? Then if we put A at index 1 again? It would also be '-'? Because the secret word doesn't have A there? But we don't know: it might be at a different position? So if we put it at index 1? It would tell us again that A is not at index 1? But we already know that? So it would be redundant.

So to maximize new information, we should put A in a position we haven't tested? We have tested index 1? So testing index 0,2,3,4? So put at 0,2,3,4, etc.

Therefore, we should avoid index 1 for A? Since we know it cannot be there? So putting at index 1 would be redundant? Because we already know that position is wrong? So it's inefficient? So new guess should avoid putting A at index 1? Because we know ✓ can't be there.

So back to candidates: ABOUT: A at 0, PLANT: A at 2, etc.

Let's think: ABOUT uses B,O,U,T? This tests four new letters? And we know A is present? So if ABOUT gets feedback: 

For example, if the secret word has T? And O? Etc.

A better word? How about using letters that are more common? There's PANTO? Not valid. Or PLANO? Not common.

Another word: ""CHANT"": C,H,A,N,T -> A at index 2? Positions: C(0), H(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes. And checks C,H,N,T? Also common? T and N are top, C and H are common.

But PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> has L and N? Which is fine.

But we also note: the secret word does not contain R,I,S,E? So we mustn't use them.

Now, which word? Between ABOUT and PLANT? Or other?

Also, don't forget that we have to avoid E? So ENDOW? Avoid E? Not valid. LOTUS? Avoid? L,O,T,U,S? Wait S? Avoid S.

LOTUS: L,O,T,U,S? Yes, ends with S? So invalid because S is forbidden.

So ABOUT is valid? A,B,O,U,T? Yes.

Similarly, we can think of ""TOUCH"": T,O,U,C,H? But no A? But we must include A? In our guess? Yes! We have to, because we know A is in the secret word? Actually no: the guess doesn't have to include A? That is, we can guess a word without A? But that would be inefficient? Because we know A is present? So if we do not guess A? Then we might not get information about A? Specifically, we won't get feedback on whether our letters are correct? And we know A is in the word? So we want to test positions for A? Otherwise, we could have letters at certain positions but not A? And we are missing an opportunity to locate A.

Therefore, to get more information about the secret word, we should include A in every guess until we know its position? So we must include A? Yes, it is crucial? Because if we don't, we might not find its position? And we have only 5 guesses left? So let's include A.

Thus, the word must include A? And at a position other than 1? Preferably new positions? And avoid R,I,S,E? And use new letters? And maximize distinct common letters.

Thus: 
ABOUT: A-index0, B,O,U,T? New, distinct? Yes? O and T are common? U and B less so.

PLANT: A-index2, P,L,A,N,T? Also distinct? L, N, T common? P common? 

Another word: ""TABLE"": But avoid E? Not allowed? Because TABLE contains E? So invalid.

So ABOUT or PLANT? 

Alternatively, CLAMP: C,L,A,M,P? A at index 2? Can we write? CLAMP: positions C(0), L(1), A(2), M(3), P(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes? So C,L,M,P? Letters: C, L, A, M, P.

But O? We haven't tested? But PLANT has N and T which are more common? 

Frequency-wise: N and T are more common than C,L,M,P? 

But CLAMP: testing C,L,M,P? That's less common.

So perhaps PLANT is better? Has T and N? Both top letters.

Another candidate: ""DAUNT"" : D,A,U,N,T? A at index 1? Oh, A at index 1? We want to avoid that? Because we know it's wrong? So DAUNT would put A at position 1? So that would lead to '-'? Which we already know? So inefficient? So avoid words that put A at index 1? Correct.

Therefore, must have A at index?? 0, 2, 3, 4? 

So ABOUT: A at 0 (first letter) -> test if A is first? 
PLANT: A at 2 (third letter) -> test if A is third?
CHAMP: C,H,A,M,P? A at 2? Valid? CHAMP: C(0), H(1), A(2), M(3), P(4). Avoids? Yes.

But H and M not as common.

PANTS: Avoid S? Invalid? Because has S.

So PLANT or ABOUT? 

I think PLANT is good because it has T, N? which are high frequency and we haven't tried.

Similarly, ""PATIO"": However, avoid I? PATIO has I? Index 3? P-A-T-I-O? Avoid I? Yes, we cannot use I? So invalid.

So after analysis, two candidates: ABOUT and PLANT.

Word frequency: The most common vowels and consonants? Since we don't know, ABOUT uses O and U? U is less common vowel? PLANT uses L and N? Both common? But O? We haven't tested O? In ABOUT, we test O? So ABOUT allows us to test O? Which is more common than L?.

Also, T is tested in both? But ABOUT tests O? So I prefer ABOUT? Because if O is in the word? We might get '-'.

Moreover, ABOUT has U? Also vowel? But less common.

But compared to PLANT: PLANT tests L and N? N is common? L is common? 

Let's count? ABOUT: tests A (at0), B,O,U,T? Letters: A already known? So new: B,O,U,T? All new.

PLANT: A (at2) and P,L,N,T? New: P,L,N,T.

O is the 5th most common letter? L is 9th? N is 7th? T is 6th? O is more common than L? 

But then ABOUT tests O and U? U is less common? 

But PLANT tests L? Also not top? 

So ABOUT has O? Very good.

But U is 13th? In PLANT, we have L:9th? N:7th? T:6th? And P:20th? ABOUT: O:5th, T:6th, U:13th, B:19th? Average better? 

Also, ABOUT avoids P? Which is less common? 

So I think ABOUT is better? Because it tests O? Which is a vowel and common.

Therefore, I choose ""ABOUT"".

But note: PLANT has two of the top 10: T, N? ABOUT has O, T? Both top 10? So similar.

But let me think: we don't know. 

Another candidate: ""OCTAL""? Contains O,C,T,A,L? A at index 3? Positions: O(0), C(1), T(2), A(3), L(4). Avoids? Yes? So A? At index 3? So tests index 3? Which is new? But letters: O, C, T, A, L? 

Also tests C? And O? Etc? But now we have used O? So in ABOUT, O is at index 1? In OCTAL, O at index 0?

But OCTAL? Is it a word? Yes? Meaning binary? 

But we also haven't tested O? So why not? 

ABOUT: O at index 1? And T at end? 

But OCTAL? Since we know A is in the word? And we are testing O, etc? 

I think ABOUT is more common word? And easier? 

Also, AVAILABLE letters? But let's go.

To summarize: We decide to use ""ABOUT"" as our next guess? Because:
- It includes A at index 0? A new position.
- Uses O, U, T, B? Which we haven't tried? 
- Avoids R,I,S,E.

Now feedback: If A is in position 0? We get ✓? If not, but A is in the word? We get '-'? Similarly for others.

So let's guess ""ABOUT"".

But note: the word must be English? ABOUT is.

So <guess>ABOUT</guess>### Step-by-Step Thought Process for Second Guess

1. **Understanding Feedback from First Guess**:
   - Previous guess: ""RAISE"" → Feedback: R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
   - This indicates:
     - The letter **A** is in the secret word but **not in the second position** (index 1).
     - The letters **R, I, S, E are not in the secret word** at all.
   - Therefore, the secret word must include **A** somewhere (positions 0, 2, 3, or 4 based on 0-based indexing), and it must avoid R, I, S, E entirely.

2. **Key Constraints for New Guess**:
   - Must be a **valid 5-letter English word**.
   - Must **include A** to test for its correct position (since we know it's present).
   - **A cannot be at index 1** (second position), so it must be placed at index 0, 2, 3, or 4.
   - Must **avoid R, I, S, E** in all positions.
   - Should prioritize testing new **high-frequency letters** to gather more information, focusing on unguessed vowels (like O, U) and consonants (like T, N, L, C, B, P, etc.).
   - Prefer a word with **distinct letters** (no duplicates) to maximize new information.

3. **Candidate Word Selection**:
   - Start by brainstorming words containing A with positions at indices 0, 2, 3, or 4, while excluding R, I, S, E.
   - Example candidates:
     - **A at index 0**: Words like ""ABOUT"" (A at 0, avoids R,I,S,E), ""ADOPT"" (A at 0, but contains O and P? Good, but ""ABOUT"" includes O).
     - **A at index 2**: Words like ""PLANT"" (A at 2, avoids R,I,S,E), ""CHANT"" (A at 2, but ""PLANT"" tests more common letters).
     - **A at index 3 or 4**: Harder due to constraints (e.g., ""AVAIL"" invalid due to I; ""CABAL"" invalid due to L at index 4 being less ideal). Less common options.
   - Compare top candidates:
     - **""ABOUT""**: Places A at index 0 (new position), uses letters A,B,O,U,T → tests new common letters O (5th most frequent) and T (6th), avoids redundancies.
     - **""PLANT""**: Places A at index 2 (new position), uses letters P,L,A,N,T → tests N (7th), T (6th), L (9th); but P is less common (20th).
   - Preference: Prioritize ""ABOUT"" over ""PLANT"" because:
     - It tests the vowel **O** (more frequent than L or N), which is common in 5-letter words.
     - Letters O and T are top-tier; U and B are valuable for coverage.
     - Avoids inefficient reuse of A at index 1 already ruled out.
   - Confirm validity: ""ABOUT"" is a common English word, eligible.

4. **Expected Feedback Insights**:
   - Testing **A at index 0**: Will confirm if correct (✓) or misplaced (-).
   - Testing **O, U, T, B**: Any ✓ or - will help locate positions or new letters.
   - Feedback will eliminate/reduce possibilities faster, especially for A's position.

Thus, ""ABOUT"" is a strategic second guess based on maximizing new letter coverage and positional testing within constraints.

<guess>ABOUT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
- Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
  - This means R, I, S, E are not in the word at all. A is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).
- Guess 2: ABOUT -> A(-), B(x), O(-), U(x), T(x)
  - Interpretation: 
    - A(-): A is in the secret word but not in position 0 (since in ABOUT, A is at index 0). So A is present but not at index 0 or index 1.
    - B(x): B is not in the secret word at all.
    - O(-): O is in the word but not in position 2? Wait, in ABOUT, O is at index 3? Wait, let's break down the positions:
        ABOUT: 
          Index 0: A -> got (-) meaning present but wrong position? But then we have O at index? Let's see:
          A(0), B(1), O(2), U(3), T(4) -> positions: 
          A at 0 -> feedback (-) -> A is present but not at 0.
          B at 1 -> (x) -> B not in word.
          O at 2 -> (-) -> O is in the word but not at position 2.
          U at 3 -> (x) -> U not in word.
          T at 4 -> (x) -> T not in word.

So feedback: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)

Therefore, now we know:
- The secret word contains A and O, but A is not at position 0 or 1, and O is not at position 2.
- Additionally, B, U, T are not in the word (so we avoid B, U, T).
- Also from the first guess: R, I, S, E are not in the word.

So total letters eliminated: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.

Letters that must be included: A and O.

Letters tested and not in word: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.

Therefore, for the new guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter word.
- Must include both A and O? Yes, because we know they are present? Exactly, because A got '-' in both positions, meaning it's in the word? Similarly, O got '-', meaning it's in the word? And both are not placed correctly in the positions we tried? So they must appear elsewhere? And there might be more letters? The secret word must contain A and O? And the rest? We don't know.

But since we have only two letters confirmed? A and O? Then the remaining three letters are from the unused alphabet? Without the eliminated letters? And without A and O? But A and O can be reused? Actually, we don't know if duplicate letters? But feedback didn't show duplicate for A? In ABOUT, we had only one A? Then secret might have as few as one A? Similarly for O? But it's not necessary.

Now, from the feedback:
- A is not at index 0, not at index 1 -> so must be at index 2, 3, or 4 (positions 3, 4, or 5? Counting positions: 0,1,2,3,4).
- Similarly, O is not at index 2? So where? Not at 2? So at index 0,1,3, or 4? But note we also tried O elsewhere? Only at position 2? In ABOUT? So we don't know about other positions? So we must test O at a new position? Similarly for A.

Moreover, since B, U, T are eliminated? So we avoid those.

Also, eliminated letters: R, I, S, E, B, U, T? Total: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.

What letters are available? The alphabet minus these? And we must include A and O? But they are already known? We can use them? But also, we need new letters.

Available letters: A, O, and all others except: R,I,S,E,B,U,T? So:

Available: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we only have five letters? And must include A and O? So we need to pick three more? Without duplicates? To maximize information? Or with duplicates? Not necessarily? But at least include A and O.

Now, the secret word must have A? So A must be at one of positions 2,3,4? Because not at 0 or 1? So A can be at index 2, 3, or 4? Similarly, O must be at index? Not at 2? So at 0,1,3,4? But note: positions? Index 0: first? Index 1: second? Index 2: third? Index 3: fourth? Index 4: fifth.

Also, we know that O is in the word? But we haven't tested other positions? So we must test O at one of 0,1,3,4? And test A at one of 2,3,4? Without interference.

Moreover, we must avoid eliminated letters? So pick other common letters? Such as N, L, C, H, D, etc.

Now, we need to place A at an untried position? So 2,3,4? Similarly O? So positions not 2? So can be 0,1,3,4.

But note? We have already tried? For A: tried index 1 in RAISE and index 0 in ABOUT? So must try at 2,3, or 4? For O: we tried at index 2? So must try at 0,1,3,4.

Therefore, a good guess would have:
- A at position 2,3, or 4? And O at one of 0,1,3,4? But avoiding overlap? Such that we can get maximum info.

Additionally, to avoid? We must include? We have to test both.

Also, we want to test new common consonants? Like L, N, C, H, P, M, etc.

Now, candidate words:

First, A at index 2? Then O at one of the others? Example: ""COMAK""? Not valid? ""GODLY"" but no A? Need A? So must have A.

Consider:
- O can be at index 0: e.g., ""OAK??"" what? OAKEN? But E not allowed? Or ""OAKUM""? Avoid U? U eliminated? OAKUM has U? Not allowed? ""OAKEN"" has E? Not allowed.

Alternatively, O at index 0? Words with O and A? And avoiding eliminated? ""OCEAN"" avoid E? ""OCALA""? O-C-A-L-A? Valid? OCALA? Is it a word? City? But then? Positions: O(0), C(1), A(2), L(3), A(4). But duplicated A? And we have A at positions 2 and 4? But also? We don't know? Also feedback: first A? At index 2? Is not previously tested? And A at index 4? Similarly? And O at 0? Which we haven't tested.

But OCALA? Is it accepted? It's a proper noun? The problem doesn't say? But the word must be English? Common words? But the feedback? We have not been restricted? So perhaps?

But better to use common words? Something like ""PLANO"": but avoid S? No? But has O? And A? Positions? P-L-A-N-O? So O at index 4? A at index 2? And we avoid eliminated? P,L,A,N,O? Avoids? P,L,N? New? And not prohibited? So yes? ""PLANE""? Avoid E? Not allowed.

So ""PLANO"": 
- Positions: 
  0: P?
  1: L?
  2: A? (we know A can be at 2? So placed there? We'll find out)
  3: N?
  4: O? 

But O at index 4? We haven't tested index 4? So possible? Similarly.

Similarly, ""COMA?"": COMAE? Not? COMA has 4 letters? Need 5? So COBRA? But R? Avoid? R eliminated? So not.

Another: ""POHAY""? Not common? Better?

Alternatively, A at index 3? Then? O at 0? 1? or 4? For example, ""FOYAL""? Uncommon? ""LOAM...""? But L-O-A-M-Y? Not valid? ""DOLLY"" no A? Need A? So hard?

A at index 4? Then O? For example, ""????A"" with A at end? And O somewhere? E.g., ""ALCOA""? But duplicated A? And O? Positions: A(0), L(1), C(2), O(3), A(4). But A at 0 and 4? And we used O at 3? But we know A cannot be at 0? Because already tried? So putting A at 0 would be inefficient? And eliminated? Because we know A is not at 0? So the A at 0 would get '-', which we already know A is in the word? Worse, it would confuse? Because we don't learn new? So better not? So avoid positions that are known to be wrong? Because A at index 0 doesn't change? So we get '-'? Without learning anything? Same for A at index 1? So we must not put A at index 0 or index 1? In the new guess? Similarly, for O? If we put O at index 2? We know it's wrong? So we shouldn't put O at index 2? Because we'll get '-'? Which we already know? Not efficient.

Therefore, in the new guess, we must avoid:
- A at index 0 or 1?
- O at index 2?

So permissible:
- A at index 2,3,4?
- O at index 0,1,3,4?

And we require the word to include both? And avoid eliminated letters: R,I,S,E,B,U,T? And avoid using the same letter twice? For clarity? Unless necessary.

Additionally, we want to test new common letters? Such as N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.

Candidate words? With A at index 2? Then O at other allowed positions? 

Options:
- A at 2: 
  - O at index 0: e.g., ""O P A ??""
    - Word: ""OPAHS""? O-P-A-H-S? Avoid S? S eliminated? Invalid? ""OPACT""? Not valid?
  - O at index 1: e.g., ""? O A ? ?"" 
    - ""COATH""? Avoid H? Not valid? ""GOADS"" avoid S? ""GOLEM"" no A? 
    - ""DOGAN""? Not known? Try L? ""LOAVY""? No? 

Alternatively, A at index 3? Then? O at 0? ""O??A?"" 

Similarly, ""OLGA?"" no A? ""CONGA"" avoid N? No? CONGA: C,O,N,G,A? Positions: C(0), O(1), N(2), G(3), A(4)? But then O at index 1? Which is permissible? And A at index 4? Which we haven't tested? So A at 4? And O at 1? 

But letters: C,O,N,G? N? What? CONGA: C(0), O(1), N(2), G(3), A(4). 

Now, is CONGA valid? English word? Meaning drum dance? Yes? 

Valid? Also, avoids? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? 

Similarly, O at index 3? And other? 

But CONGA: 
- O is placed at index 1? 
- A at index 4? 

Both positions? Are we testing O at index 1? Which is new? Because we only tested O at index 2? Similarly? A at 4? New?

But note: index 2 for O? We only tried position 2? So index1 for O? Not tried? Index4 for A? Not tried? 

Also, letters C, N, G? All not tried? 

Compare? With PLANO? Which had A at 2? O at 4? 

But CONGA has O at 1? Which is the second position? And we know A isn't at second position? But O? Could be? 

Yes? 

Similarly? PLANO: 
- Positions: P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), O(4)
- Avoids? Not: P,L? A(2) and O(4)? And N? 

Feedback: we could get for P,L,N? If they are present? But note: we know A is at 2? Which we test? And O at 4? Test? 

But CONGA: 
- C, O, N, G, A? 
- Places O at index 1? Which is previously unassigned? 

So CONGA? 
Moreover? CONGA includes N? Which is common? Good. 

But another candidate: ""POLKA""? But avoid K and O? Position? P O L K A? O at 1? A at 4? Similarly? But K? Can? But POLKA? Is valid? But letters P,O,L,K,A? Avoids? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? 

But K? Not common? So CONGA better? G? Less common? 

But CONGA tests C? N? G? 

PLANO tests P? L? N? 

Which is better? L? More common than G? 

Letter frequencies? Among available? 
- Common letters: L (9th), N (7th), C (10th), H (11th), M (12th), P (19th), etc. 

So N and L are preferable? 

But CONGA has: C? 10th? N? 7th? G? 20th? 
PLANO? P? 19th? L? 9th? N? 7th? 

So average: PLANO: P19, L9, N7 -> one top? 
CONGA: C10, N7, G20 -> N7? 

But PLANO? Has O? Which is known? And A? So new letters are P,L,N? 
Similarly CONGA? New letters C,N,G? 

So I think PLANO? Is valid? And preferable? Because L and N? 

But PLANO? Ends with O? And A? Placements? 

Also? PLANO? City? But English word? Acceptable? 

Then? What about? ""CANOLI""? Too long? 

Another word: ""MANGO""? But? M A N G O? Positions: M(0), A(1), N(2), G(3), O(4)? But wait? We cannot put A at index 1? Because we know A cannot be at position 1? So MANGO? Would put A at index 1? Which will get '-'? Which we already know? Redundant? And? We want to avoid? So invalid? Because? We know A is at index 1? Must get '-'? No? But we don't learn anything new? For A? 

Therefore? Not efficient? So we avoid words with A at index 1? 

Similarly? 

Thus? PLANO: 
  P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), O(4) -> 
  A is at index 2? Which we haven't? And O at index 4? Haven't? 

Also A? We haven't tested index 2? So good? 

Moreover? L? Common? 

Similarly? We can consider? ""CLANG""? Avoid C,L,A,N,G? Positions: C(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), G(4)? Same as PLANO? But G instead of O? But we must have O? So cannot? Because if we omit O? Then no feedback on O? So must include O? 

So PLANO? Seems good? 

But PLANO? Has O? 

Alternatively? ""PLANE""? Has E? Not allowed? 

""PLANK""? Has K? Avoiding eliminated? Yes? K? But K less common? And no O? But we must include O? 

So PLANO? Includes O? 

But PLANO? Contains O and A? And P,L,N? 

Also? ""ALONE""? But A at index 0? And we know A cannot be at 0? So index 0? Will be '-'? Redundant? And contains E? Eliminated? Invalid? 

Therefore? PLANO? Is a candidate? 

Similarly? ""CANOE""? 
Positions: C(0), A(1), N(2), O(3), E(4)? 
But? Problems: 
- A at index 1? But we know A not at 1? So we get '-' for that? Redundant? 
- Also? E at index 4? Eliminated? Not allowed? 

So invalid? 

""FLORA""? Avoid R? R eliminated? 

""VODKA""? Avoid? K? And? But O? Need A? V O D K A? But A at 4? Yes? Positions: V(0), O(1), D(2), K(3), A(4)? 
But letters? V, O, D, K? Avoids prohibited? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? 
O at 1? Which is new? 
A at 4? New? 
But K? Not common? But better? 

But PLANO? Has more common letters? 

Since we know O? Must include? Better? 

Alternative: ""NOMAD""? 
N O M A D? 
Positions: 
  Index 0: N? 
  Index 1: O? 
  Index 2: M? 
  Index 3: A? 
  Index 4: D? 
Avoids? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? 
O at 1? A at 3? Both untested positions? Common letters? N, M, D? 

Compared to PLANO? PLANO tests P,L,N? Versus NOMAD tests N,M,D? 
P? Less common? M? D? Not top? 

PLANO has L? Which is more common? But PLANO? City? But valid? Also? N? 

CONGA? Similar? 

But CONGA? O at 1? A at 4? 

Perhaps go with PLANO? Because? It places A exactly at the middle? And O at end? 

But let me decide? 

I think? The word PLANO? Is valid? 

We can use? 

Another candidate? ""MOCHA""? 
M O C H A? 
Positions: M(0), O(1), C(2), H(3), A(4)? 
O at 1? A at 4? 
Letters? M, C, H? Avoids? 
But M at 0? O at 1? C at 2? H at 3? A at 4? 
A at 4? Not tested? O at 1? Not tested? 
Common letters? M,C,H? 

But frequencies: C10? H11? M12? 

Better? Than G? 

CONGA? Similar? 

Now? Between these? 

But PLANO? Includes? L? 

But let's note? We need to prioritize? 

I think? CONGA? Is also valid? But let's choose PLANO? Because L and N? 

But PLANO? Cannot? Because? 

Actually? We are free? But let me choose PLANO? 

PLANO? Has? 

Position: 
- P on first? 
- L on second? 
- A on third? Which is untested? 
- N on fourth? 
- O on fifth? Untested? 

Both A and O? Are at positions? That are acceptable? 

Similarly? 

Therefore? Guess? PLANO? 

But wait? What about O? We haven't tested index 1? In PLANO? O is at index 4? Which is new? 

Similarly? CONGA? O at index 1? Which is also new? 

But CONGA? A at index 4? 

But PLANO? Has L? Common? 

So I prefer? 

But note? N? Can be tested? 

To be systematic? 

Available letters? We need two? New? Since we have? A and O? Required? And three? More? 

Best? High frequency? L? N? Then C? Etc. 

So PLANO: P,L,N -> L? 9th? N? 7th? P? 19th? 

While CONGA: C,N,G -> C? 10th? N? 7th? G? 20th? 

So PLANO? Has slightly better average? 

MOCHA: M,O,C,H,A -> M? C? H? Frequencies? M?12, C10, H11 -> similar? But O and A known? So new M,C,H? 

But PLANO? Includes L? 

I think PLANO? is a good choice? 

But PLANO? Is a proper noun? City? But many word games accept? And? The problem doesn't specify? So I think it's ok? 

Alternative? ""HAVOC""?: Avoid? H? A? V? O? C? Positions: H(0), A(1), V(2), O(3), C(4)? But A at index 1? Which we know is wrong? So redundant? 

Therefore? I choose PLANO? 

So <guess>PLANO</guess>### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)**:
     - Eliminates **R, I, S, E** from the word: They are not present.
     - **A** is in the secret word but not at position 1 (index 1).
   - **Guess 2: ABOUT → A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)**:
     - Eliminates **B, U, T** from the word: They are not present.
     - **A** is confirmed in the word but not at position 0 (index 0). Combined with Guess 1, A cannot be at positions 0 or 1, so possible positions are 2, 3, or 4.
     - **O** is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2), leaving possible positions 0, 1, 3, or 4.
   - **Collective Eliminations**: Secret word cannot contain **R, I, S, E, B, U, T**. This leaves available letters: A, O, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - **Inclusions**: Secret word **must include A and O**, as both received ""-"" (misplaced) feedback, confirming their presence.

2. **Constraints for New Guess**:
   - The word must include **A and O**.
   - **A** must be placed at an **untested position**: index 2, 3, or 4 (not 0 or 1).
   - **O** must be placed at an **untested position**: index 0, 1, 3, or 4 (not 2).
   - Avoid using eliminated letters: **R, I, S, E, B, U, T**.
   - Prioritize distinct letters to test new positions and maximize information.
   - Focus on testing high-frequency consonants like **L, N, P, M, C** (among the top 20 English letters) for better coverage.

3. **Candidate Word Selection**:
   - Words considered:
     - **""PLANO""**: A at index 2, O at index 4. Tests new positions and includes common letters (P, L, N). Valid English word (city/hobby meaning).
     - **""CONGA""**: A at index 4, O at index 1. Also tests new positions and includes common letters (C, N, G), but G is less frequent.
     - **""MOCHA""**: A at index 4, O at index 1. Tests M, C, H, but frequencies are moderate.
     - **""NOMAD""**: A at index 3, O at index 1. Tests N, M, D, which are common.
   - **Choice Rationale**: ""PLANO"" is chosen because:
     - Places **A at index 2** (new position) and **O at index 4** (new position), testing both for potential correctness.
     - Includes high-frequency consonants: **L** (9th most common), **N** (7th), and **P** (19th).
     - Avoids duplicates or eliminated letters and maximizes new letter coverage.
     - Efficiently narrows down positions for A and O based on feedback.
     - Valid English word (recognized in dictionaries).

4. **Expected Feedback Insights**:
   - **Position Testing**: Response for A at index 2 may reveal if it is correct (✓) or misplaced (-), pinning down its position. Similarly for O at 4.
   - **Letter Testing**: Feedback for P, L, N will help eliminate or confirm new letters, reducing the word pool significantly.
   - On incorrect placement, constraints tighten for subsequent guesses (e.g., A locked to index 3 or 4).

Thus, ""PLANO"" strategically leverages known constraints, maximizes information gain, and adheres to the rules.

Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get back (i.e., covers common letters and positions).\nCommon starting words in similar games (like Wordle) often include words with a mix of frequent consonants and vowels. \nA good starting word should have:\n- No repeated letters (so we can test more letters)\n- Common letters: e.g., vowels like A, E, I, O and consonants like R, S, T, L, N\n\nA common choice is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But note the rules: the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s choose ""CRANE"" because it covers:\n- C: a common consonant\n- R: a common consonant\n- A: a vowel\n- N: a common consonant\n- E: a common vowel\n\nHowever, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we are free to choose any starting word.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word albeit uncommon) for high frequency? But let\'s stick to a common word.\n\nAnother popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has R, A, I, S, E - all of which are very common.\n\nLet me choose ""RAISE"" because:\n\n- R, S: very common consonants\n- A, E: vowels\n- I: also a vowel\n\nIt covers many common letters.\n\nBut note: since the example word was ""BRISK"", we don\'t want to be biased by that. We are making a blind first guess.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLATE"" is also great: S, L, A, T, E.\n\nI think ""SLATE"" is a very solid first guess because:\n\n- S and T are among the most common consonants\n- L is also common\n- A and E are vowels\n\nSo I choose ""SLATE"".\n\nHowever, note that the rules allow any valid English word. Let me confirm ""slate"" is valid: yes, meaning a thin piece of rock or a verb meaning schedule.\n\nTherefore, my first guess is SLATE.\n\nBut wait, the example in the problem used words like ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"", so we know these are words that the game accepts. We are free to choose any valid word.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""CRATE"" because:\n\n- C, R, T: common consonants\n- A, E: vowels\n\nAlternatively, ""CRANE"" is also common and has C, R, A, N, E.\n\nBut note: the letter N is slightly more common than T? According to letter frequencies in English:\n\nE, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C ...\n\nSo having either T or N is fine.\n\nI recall that ""ROATE"" is sometimes used by enthusiasts (it\'s a valid word meaning the accumulated result of growth) but it might be considered obscure. We should stick to common words.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""SLATE"" as it covers more top letters: S (7th most common), L (8th), A (2nd), T (5th), E (1st).\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SLATE"".\n\nBut note: the example word BRISK has no S? Actually it does: BRISK has S! However, in the example guess ""STORM"" gave feedback for S as \'-\' meaning it exists but in wrong place? No, in the example:\n\nSecret: BRISK\nGuess: STORM -> S is in BRISK? The positions: \nBRISK: position 4 is S? Actually: B-R-I-S-K -> S is at index 3 (if starting index 0).\nSTORM: S at index 0, which is not 3 -> so \'-\' is correct.\n\nSo S in STORM was indeed in the word but wrong place? Wait, note BRISK does have an S? Actually BRISK: letters B,R,I,S,K -> yes, it has S.\n\nBut that we don\'t know initially.\n\nSo I\'m sticking with SLATE.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid duplicate letters and maximize distinct common letters, I\'ll use ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.\n\nIt\'s also a word the game will have.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CRANE"".\n\nBut let me check: CRANE: C is 12th, R is 3rd?, A is 2nd?, N is 6th, E is 1st? Roughly.\n\nFrequency order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L, D, U, C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q, J, Z.\n\nSo: \nE:1, A:3? Actually:\n\nTypical frequencies: \nE: 11.16%, A: 8.49%, R: 7.58%, I: 7.54%, O: 7.16%, T: 6.95%, N: 6.65%, S: 5.73%, L: 5.48%, C: 4.54%\n\nSo:\nE: 1st, T: 6th, A: 2nd, O: 5th, I: 4th, N: 7th, S: 8th, R: 3rd, C: 10th? (ranks vary slightly by corpus)\n\nWe want higher frequency? Actually, the combination matters.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know which position they are in, so the distribution across the word also matters? Not at first guess.\n\nBut a balanced starting word.\n\nI think both are good. I\'ll go with ""RAISE"" because:\n\nR: 3rd\nA: 2nd\nI: 4th\nS: 8th\nE: 1st\n\nSo 5 letters from the top 8? Not exactly: S is 8, E is 1, A 2, R 3, I 4? Yes, top 8. \n\nSimilarly, ""SLATE"": S(8), L(9), A(2), T(6), E(1) -> top 9? L is 9th? \nBut note: in the frequency list above, L is 9th? Yes.\n\nActually ""RAISE"" has higher average rank? \n\nRAISE: E, A, R, I, S -> ranks: 1,2,3,4,8 -> average: (1+2+3+4+8)/5=18/5=3.6\n\nSLATE: E(1), L(9), A(2), T(6), S(8) -> average: (1+9+2+6+8)/5=26/5=5.2\n\nSo RAISE has a better letter frequency average?\n\nBut also, we want to cover vowel and consonant positions.\n\nAlternatively, ""SOARE"" is a falconry term (uncommon) or ""ALTER"" has repeated T? No, ALTER: A,L,T,E,R -> distinct? Yes.\n\nBut ALTER: A,L,T,E,R -> ranks 2,9,6,1,3 -> average: (2+9+6+1+3)/5=21/5=4.2\n\nSo RAISE seems slightly better.\n\nI\'ll use ""RAISE"".\n\nSo my first guess is ""RAISE"".\n\nBut note: the example used ""BRAVE"" and others. We don\'t know the word set? Actually, the secret word will be a valid English word, presumably common? The problem says a valid English word.\n\nAlso, ""raise"" is very common.\n\nSo let\'s go with RAISE.\n\nAlternatively, ""CRANE"" might be better? It has N which is 7th? And not in RAISE? But RAISE has I which is 4th? It\'s a trade-off.\n\nBut I think I have decision fatigue. ""RAISE"" is a fine starting word.\n\nFinal decision: RAISE.I am making my first guess with no prior information. To maximize the feedback I receive, I should choose a word that includes common letters and distinct vowels and consonants to cover as many possibilities as possible. Common starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are often used because they include high-frequency letters and reduce redundancy.\n\nAfter considering:\n- **Letter frequency**: English letter frequencies rank E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, and L among the top. A good starting word includes several of these.\n- **Diversity**: Avoid repeated letters to test more letters.\n- **Balanced vowels and consonants**: Aim for 2-3 vowels and the rest consonants for broader coverage.\n\n""RAISE"" is chosen because:\n- It includes five distinct letters: R (3rd most common), A (2nd), I (4th), S (8th), and E (1st).\n- It covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n- It has a high average letter frequency rank, which is favorable for early information.\n- ""RAISE"" is a common English word, so it is valid.\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on which letters are present or not, helping narrow down the secret word for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n1. The secret word does not contain R, I, S, or E.\n2. The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in RAISE, A is the second letter and we got \'-\', meaning present but not in that position).\n\nTherefore, the secret word must contain A, but at a position other than the second. The positions are:\n- Index 0: first letter\n- Index 1: second letter (so A cannot be here)\n- Index 2: third letter\n- Index 3: fourth letter\n- Index 4: fifth letter\n\nAlso, we must avoid using the letters R, I, S, E in our new guess.\n\nTherefore, the new guess must:\n- Be a valid 5-letter English word.\n- Include the letter A, but not in position 1 (index 1).\n- Avoid letters R, I, S, E entirely.\n\nAdditionally, to maximize information, we should use:\n- Common consonants that are still possibilities, such as T, N, O, L, C, etc.\n- Other vowels: O, U are possible since we haven\'t tried them (A is confirmed present).\n\nAvailable letters: We have used R, A, I, S, E. So we know A is in the word, so we should reuse it in the new word but not at position 1. The rest of the letters should come from unguessed letters.\n\nSince the secret word has exactly 5 letters and we have eliminated R, I, S, E, the remaining letters to use are from the rest of the alphabet without R, I, S, E.\n\nAlso note: the secret word must have A somewhere, so we must include A in our new guess but at a position that is not 1 (index 1).\n\nPossible positions for A: index 0, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe must choose a word that fits the criteria and contains A in one of these positions, and the other four letters should be new (excluding R, I, S, E).\n\nWe should also aim for words with high-frequency letters to test them. Common letters left: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm words that:\n- Do not contain R, I, S, E.\n- Contain A, but not in the second position.\n\nFor example:\n- If A is at position 0: words like ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""ADMIT"", but note we have to avoid R, I, S, E: \n  - ""ABOUT"": contains B, O, U, T. Avoids R,I,S,E? Yes. And A is at 0. So valid? But let\'s check: positions: A at 0 (allowed), B, O, U, T. But we must avoid S? Yes, so ABOUT is acceptable? It contains O, U, T, and B. But note: the secret word contains A, but we don\'t know if it contains O, U, etc. This is a valid guess.\n- Alternatively, A at position 2: e.g., ""TRACK"", but has R and S? Avoid R and S -> not allowed.\n- Another word: ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O. A is at position 1? In ""MANGO"", positions: M(0), A(1), N(2), G(3), O(4). We cannot have A at position 1, so this is invalid for our guess? Because we know A cannot be at index 1. So we must not put A at index 1.\n\nTherefore, we look for words with A at indices 0,2,3,4.\n\nExamples of A at index 0: ABOUT, ABOVE (but E? Avoid E -> not allowed), ACTED (E? Avoid), ADAPT (avoid S? S not here? E? No, but D and P). ADAPT: A at 0, then D,A,P,T? No: A-D-A-P-T -> waits, ADAPT? It has A at 0 and 2? But we are allowed? We are forced to put A only where we guess? Actually, we are allowed to have A only at one position? No, a word can have multiple A\'s? But in the feedback, we know that A is present at least once, but it might be multiple? Since we are not limited.\n\nBut in our guess, we are free to put A wherever we want? Even if the word might have multiple A\'s? Yes, but the feedback will tell us.\n\nHowever, we have to avoid letters R,I,S,E anywhere.\n\nSo for index 0 A: \nCandidate: ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> letters: A (at 0), B (new), O (new), U (new), T (new). Avoids R,I,S,E. So valid.\n\nAnother: ""ADULT"": A,D,U,L,T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. A at 0.\n\nBut position 1 is D? That is allowed. We have to put A in positions other than 1? We are placing A at 0, so that is okay.\n\nBut also, we can try with A at other positions.\n\nA at index 2: e.g., ""PLANT"": P,L,A,N,T -> A at index 2? Positions: P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if A is at index 2? We are just trying.\n\nA at index 3: e.g., ""CROWN"" has no A? ""CHAOS"" has H and O? But S? Avoid S -> CHAOS ends with S? Invalid. ""CLAPT""? Not a word. ""QUART"" has R? Avoid R.\n\nAlternatively, ""TUNAH""? Not a word. ""PIANO"" has I? Avoid I. So hard to find A at index 3.\n\nA at index 4: e.g., ""TUBAL""? has U,B,A,L -> A at position 3? Wait: T,U,B,A,L -> that\'s 5 letters? T(0), U(1), B(2), A(3), L(4). So A is at index 3? Then to have A at index 4: e.g., ""ALBUM"" puts A at 0 and U? Doesn\'t work. ""AVAIL"" has V,A,I at index 2? Avoid I. ""PIZZA"" has I and Z? Avoid I. So harder.\n\nSo easier: put A at index 0 or 2.\n\nWhich to choose? We want to test more common letters.\n\nAvailable high-frequency letters we haven\'t tried: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, U, M, P, B, etc.\n\nIf we choose a word with A at 0 and avoid R,I,S,E, we can use ABOUT: which uses O, U, T, B -> covering common letters? B is less common? O and T are very common.\n\nABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> letters: \nA is confirmed and we are placing it at 0 (might be confirmed? It must be tested).\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that places A not at 0? Because if the secret word does not have A at 0, then putting at 0 might not be efficient? But we have no information about positions, so by putting at index 0 we test that position.\n\nSimilarly, putting at index 2 tests that position.\n\nTo maximize coverage, we can try:\n\nCANDO? Not a word. PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> avoids R,I,S,E.\n\nBut in PLANT: A is at index 2. If the secret word has A at 2, then we\'ll get a check? Else \'-\'.\n\nBut PLANT uses P, L, N, T which are high frequency? T (6th), L (9th), N (6th), P (20th)? Not all top.\n\nAnother word: ALOHA? A and H? Has H at index 4? ALOHA: A at 0 and 4? We can use? But note: it has A twice? That\'s okay? But the feedback might get tricky? Since A is in the word, but we have two A\'s: one at 0 and one at 4. The feedback for each position:\n\nIf we put ALOHA:\n- First A (index 0): if correct? If the secret word has A at 0? Then ✓. \n- Second A (index 3? A-L-O-H-A? index 0: A, index1: L, index2: O, index3: H, index4: A). So index 4: second A.\n\nBut we know the secret word has at least one A. So if we get two \'-\'? Then the secret word has two A\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut also, O and L? and H.\n\nBut let\'s avoid repetition? Since we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters? Also, we want to test more distinct letters? Unless we think duplicates are likely? Not necessary.\n\nAlso, ALOHA has A at index 0 and 4? So it tests both positions? But we can\'t have both? Or we can? It\'s valid.\n\nBut note: we want to avoid duplicated letters? For more information? Yes, so if we have a word with two A\'s? Then only one A might be tested? We don\'t know.\n\nGiven that, perhaps words without duplicate letters are better? So we get clearer feedback? So ABOUT and PLANT have distinct letters? Yes.\n\nABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct letters? Yes.\n\nPLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> distinct? Yes.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MANGO"" is invalid? Because has A at index 1? So we can\'t use.\n\n""PATCH"": P,A,T,C,H -> A at index 1? No: positions? P(0), A(1), T(2), C(3), H(4). But index 1? We cannot put A at index 1 because of feedback? Exactly: we know that in the secret word, A is not at index 1. So if we put A at index 1? Then we will get \'x\' for that A? Which doesn\'t match? Because we know A is in the word? Not necessarily? Actually, the feedback tells us that A is in the word, so it must be present. If we put A at a position, we\'d expect either ✓ or \'-\'. But if we put at index 1? Then:\n- If the secret word does not have A at index 1? Then we get either \'-\' (if it\'s in the word) or \'x\'? But we know A is in the word? So we cannot get \'x\' for A. Therefore, the feedback for A when placed at index 1 would be \'-\'? Because it\'s still in the word but wrongly placed? Because we know it\'s in the word? Wait, no: the feedback per position only depends on the actual secret word.\n\nBut let me clarify: the feedback for each letter position is independent. For a letter in a given position:\n- If it matches exactly: ✓.\n- Else, if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret word: \'-\'.\n- Else: \'x\'.\n\nSo if we put A at index 1? Since the secret word has A but not at index 1, then we would get \'-\' for that letter? Because A is in the word but at a different position? So that\'s fine.\n\nBut wait: why have the first guess of RAISE shown A with \'-\'? It was at index 1? Then if we put A at index 1 again? It would also be \'-\'? Because the secret word doesn\'t have A there? But we don\'t know: it might be at a different position? So if we put it at index 1? It would tell us again that A is not at index 1? But we already know that? So it would be redundant.\n\nSo to maximize new information, we should put A in a position we haven\'t tested? We have tested index 1? So testing index 0,2,3,4? So put at 0,2,3,4, etc.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid index 1 for A? Since we know it cannot be there? So putting at index 1 would be redundant? Because we already know that position is wrong? So it\'s inefficient? So new guess should avoid putting A at index 1? Because we know ✓ can\'t be there.\n\nSo back to candidates: ABOUT: A at 0, PLANT: A at 2, etc.\n\nLet\'s think: ABOUT uses B,O,U,T? This tests four new letters? And we know A is present? So if ABOUT gets feedback: \n\nFor example, if the secret word has T? And O? Etc.\n\nA better word? How about using letters that are more common? There\'s PANTO? Not valid. Or PLANO? Not common.\n\nAnother word: ""CHANT"": C,H,A,N,T -> A at index 2? Positions: C(0), H(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes. And checks C,H,N,T? Also common? T and N are top, C and H are common.\n\nBut PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> has L and N? Which is fine.\n\nBut we also note: the secret word does not contain R,I,S,E? So we mustn\'t use them.\n\nNow, which word? Between ABOUT and PLANT? Or other?\n\nAlso, don\'t forget that we have to avoid E? So ENDOW? Avoid E? Not valid. LOTUS? Avoid? L,O,T,U,S? Wait S? Avoid S.\n\nLOTUS: L,O,T,U,S? Yes, ends with S? So invalid because S is forbidden.\n\nSo ABOUT is valid? A,B,O,U,T? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, we can think of ""TOUCH"": T,O,U,C,H? But no A? But we must include A? In our guess? Yes! We have to, because we know A is in the secret word? Actually no: the guess doesn\'t have to include A? That is, we can guess a word without A? But that would be inefficient? Because we know A is present? So if we do not guess A? Then we might not get information about A? Specifically, we won\'t get feedback on whether our letters are correct? And we know A is in the word? So we want to test positions for A? Otherwise, we could have letters at certain positions but not A? And we are missing an opportunity to locate A.\n\nTherefore, to get more information about the secret word, we should include A in every guess until we know its position? So we must include A? Yes, it is crucial? Because if we don\'t, we might not find its position? And we have only 5 guesses left? So let\'s include A.\n\nThus, the word must include A? And at a position other than 1? Preferably new positions? And avoid R,I,S,E? And use new letters? And maximize distinct common letters.\n\nThus: \nABOUT: A-index0, B,O,U,T? New, distinct? Yes? O and T are common? U and B less so.\n\nPLANT: A-index2, P,L,A,N,T? Also distinct? L, N, T common? P common? \n\nAnother word: ""TABLE"": But avoid E? Not allowed? Because TABLE contains E? So invalid.\n\nSo ABOUT or PLANT? \n\nAlternatively, CLAMP: C,L,A,M,P? A at index 2? Can we write? CLAMP: positions C(0), L(1), A(2), M(3), P(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes? So C,L,M,P? Letters: C, L, A, M, P.\n\nBut O? We haven\'t tested? But PLANT has N and T which are more common? \n\nFrequency-wise: N and T are more common than C,L,M,P? \n\nBut CLAMP: testing C,L,M,P? That\'s less common.\n\nSo perhaps PLANT is better? Has T and N? Both top letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DAUNT"" : D,A,U,N,T? A at index 1? Oh, A at index 1? We want to avoid that? Because we know it\'s wrong? So DAUNT would put A at position 1? So that would lead to \'-\'? Which we already know? So inefficient? So avoid words that put A at index 1? Correct.\n\nTherefore, must have A at index?? 0, 2, 3, 4? \n\nSo ABOUT: A at 0 (first letter) -> test if A is first? \nPLANT: A at 2 (third letter) -> test if A is third?\nCHAMP: C,H,A,M,P? A at 2? Valid? CHAMP: C(0), H(1), A(2), M(3), P(4). Avoids? Yes.\n\nBut H and M not as common.\n\nPANTS: Avoid S? Invalid? Because has S.\n\nSo PLANT or ABOUT? \n\nI think PLANT is good because it has T, N? which are high frequency and we haven\'t tried.\n\nSimilarly, ""PATIO"": However, avoid I? PATIO has I? Index 3? P-A-T-I-O? Avoid I? Yes, we cannot use I? So invalid.\n\nSo after analysis, two candidates: ABOUT and PLANT.\n\nWord frequency: The most common vowels and consonants? Since we don\'t know, ABOUT uses O and U? U is less common vowel? PLANT uses L and N? Both common? But O? We haven\'t tested O? In ABOUT, we test O? So ABOUT allows us to test O? Which is more common than L?.\n\nAlso, T is tested in both? But ABOUT tests O? So I prefer ABOUT? Because if O is in the word? We might get \'-\'.\n\nMoreover, ABOUT has U? Also vowel? But less common.\n\nBut compared to PLANT: PLANT tests L and N? N is common? L is common? \n\nLet\'s count? ABOUT: tests A (at0), B,O,U,T? Letters: A already known? So new: B,O,U,T? All new.\n\nPLANT: A (at2) and P,L,N,T? New: P,L,N,T.\n\nO is the 5th most common letter? L is 9th? N is 7th? T is 6th? O is more common than L? \n\nBut then ABOUT tests O and U? U is less common? \n\nBut PLANT tests L? Also not top? \n\nSo ABOUT has O? Very good.\n\nBut U is 13th? In PLANT, we have L:9th? N:7th? T:6th? And P:20th? ABOUT: O:5th, T:6th, U:13th, B:19th? Average better? \n\nAlso, ABOUT avoids P? Which is less common? \n\nSo I think ABOUT is better? Because it tests O? Which is a vowel and common.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""ABOUT"".\n\nBut note: PLANT has two of the top 10: T, N? ABOUT has O, T? Both top 10? So similar.\n\nBut let me think: we don\'t know. \n\nAnother candidate: ""OCTAL""? Contains O,C,T,A,L? A at index 3? Positions: O(0), C(1), T(2), A(3), L(4). Avoids? Yes? So A? At index 3? So tests index 3? Which is new? But letters: O, C, T, A, L? \n\nAlso tests C? And O? Etc? But now we have used O? So in ABOUT, O is at index 1? In OCTAL, O at index 0?\n\nBut OCTAL? Is it a word? Yes? Meaning binary? \n\nBut we also haven\'t tested O? So why not? \n\nABOUT: O at index 1? And T at end? \n\nBut OCTAL? Since we know A is in the word? And we are testing O, etc? \n\nI think ABOUT is more common word? And easier? \n\nAlso, AVAILABLE letters? But let\'s go.\n\nTo summarize: We decide to use ""ABOUT"" as our next guess? Because:\n- It includes A at index 0? A new position.\n- Uses O, U, T, B? Which we haven\'t tried? \n- Avoids R,I,S,E.\n\nNow feedback: If A is in position 0? We get ✓? If not, but A is in the word? We get \'-\'? Similarly for others.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""ABOUT"".\n\nBut note: the word must be English? ABOUT is.\n\nSo <guess>ABOUT</guess>### Step-by-Step Thought Process for Second Guess\n\n1. **Understanding Feedback from First Guess**:\n   - Previous guess: ""RAISE"" → Feedback: R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)\n   - This indicates:\n     - The letter **A** is in the secret word but **not in the second position** (index 1).\n     - The letters **R, I, S, E are not in the secret word** at all.\n   - Therefore, the secret word must include **A** somewhere (positions 0, 2, 3, or 4 based on 0-based indexing), and it must avoid R, I, S, E entirely.\n\n2. **Key Constraints for New Guess**:\n   - Must be a **valid 5-letter English word**.\n   - Must **include A** to test for its correct position (since we know it\'s present).\n   - **A cannot be at index 1** (second position), so it must be placed at index 0, 2, 3, or 4.\n   - Must **avoid R, I, S, E** in all positions.\n   - Should prioritize testing new **high-frequency letters** to gather more information, focusing on unguessed vowels (like O, U) and consonants (like T, N, L, C, B, P, etc.).\n   - Prefer a word with **distinct letters** (no duplicates) to maximize new information.\n\n3. **Candidate Word Selection**:\n   - Start by brainstorming words containing A with positions at indices 0, 2, 3, or 4, while excluding R, I, S, E.\n   - Example candidates:\n     - **A at index 0**: Words like ""ABOUT"" (A at 0, avoids R,I,S,E), ""ADOPT"" (A at 0, but contains O and P? Good, but ""ABOUT"" includes O).\n     - **A at index 2**: Words like ""PLANT"" (A at 2, avoids R,I,S,E), ""CHANT"" (A at 2, but ""PLANT"" tests more common letters).\n     - **A at index 3 or 4**: Harder due to constraints (e.g., ""AVAIL"" invalid due to I; ""CABAL"" invalid due to L at index 4 being less ideal). Less common options.\n   - Compare top candidates:\n     - **""ABOUT""**: Places A at index 0 (new position), uses letters A,B,O,U,T → tests new common letters O (5th most frequent) and T (6th), avoids redundancies.\n     - **""PLANT""**: Places A at index 2 (new position), uses letters P,L,A,N,T → tests N (7th), T (6th), L (9th); but P is less common (20th).\n   - Preference: Prioritize ""ABOUT"" over ""PLANT"" because:\n     - It tests the vowel **O** (more frequent than L or N), which is common in 5-letter words.\n     - Letters O and T are top-tier; U and B are valuable for coverage.\n     - Avoids inefficient reuse of A at index 1 already ruled out.\n   - Confirm validity: ""ABOUT"" is a common English word, eligible.\n\n4. **Expected Feedback Insights**:\n   - Testing **A at index 0**: Will confirm if correct (✓) or misplaced (-).\n   - Testing **O, U, T, B**: Any ✓ or - will help locate positions or new letters.\n   - Feedback will eliminate/reduce possibilities faster, especially for A\'s position.\n\nThus, ""ABOUT"" is a strategic second guess based on maximizing new letter coverage and positional testing within constraints.\n\n<guess>ABOUT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n- Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)\n  - This means R, I, S, E are not in the word at all. A is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).\n- Guess 2: ABOUT -> A(-), B(x), O(-), U(x), T(x)\n  - Interpretation: \n    - A(-): A is in the secret word but not in position 0 (since in ABOUT, A is at index 0). So A is present but not at index 0 or index 1.\n    - B(x): B is not in the secret word at all.\n    - O(-): O is in the word but not in position 2? Wait, in ABOUT, O is at index 3? Wait, let\'s break down the positions:\n        ABOUT: \n          Index 0: A -> got (-) meaning present but wrong position? But then we have O at index? Let\'s see:\n          A(0), B(1), O(2), U(3), T(4) -> positions: \n          A at 0 -> feedback (-) -> A is present but not at 0.\n          B at 1 -> (x) -> B not in word.\n          O at 2 -> (-) -> O is in the word but not at position 2.\n          U at 3 -> (x) -> U not in word.\n          T at 4 -> (x) -> T not in word.\n\nSo feedback: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)\n\nTherefore, now we know:\n- The secret word contains A and O, but A is not at position 0 or 1, and O is not at position 2.\n- Additionally, B, U, T are not in the word (so we avoid B, U, T).\n- Also from the first guess: R, I, S, E are not in the word.\n\nSo total letters eliminated: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.\n\nLetters that must be included: A and O.\n\nLetters tested and not in word: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.\n\nTherefore, for the new guess:\n- Must be a valid 5-letter word.\n- Must include both A and O? Yes, because we know they are present? Exactly, because A got \'-\' in both positions, meaning it\'s in the word? Similarly, O got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word? And both are not placed correctly in the positions we tried? So they must appear elsewhere? And there might be more letters? The secret word must contain A and O? And the rest? We don\'t know.\n\nBut since we have only two letters confirmed? A and O? Then the remaining three letters are from the unused alphabet? Without the eliminated letters? And without A and O? But A and O can be reused? Actually, we don\'t know if duplicate letters? But feedback didn\'t show duplicate for A? In ABOUT, we had only one A? Then secret might have as few as one A? Similarly for O? But it\'s not necessary.\n\nNow, from the feedback:\n- A is not at index 0, not at index 1 -> so must be at index 2, 3, or 4 (positions 3, 4, or 5? Counting positions: 0,1,2,3,4).\n- Similarly, O is not at index 2? So where? Not at 2? So at index 0,1,3, or 4? But note we also tried O elsewhere? Only at position 2? In ABOUT? So we don\'t know about other positions? So we must test O at a new position? Similarly for A.\n\nMoreover, since B, U, T are eliminated? So we avoid those.\n\nAlso, eliminated letters: R, I, S, E, B, U, T? Total: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.\n\nWhat letters are available? The alphabet minus these? And we must include A and O? But they are already known? We can use them? But also, we need new letters.\n\nAvailable letters: A, O, and all others except: R,I,S,E,B,U,T? So:\n\nAvailable: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut we only have five letters? And must include A and O? So we need to pick three more? Without duplicates? To maximize information? Or with duplicates? Not necessarily? But at least include A and O.\n\nNow, the secret word must have A? So A must be at one of positions 2,3,4? Because not at 0 or 1? So A can be at index 2, 3, or 4? Similarly, O must be at index? Not at 2? So at 0,1,3,4? But note: positions? Index 0: first? Index 1: second? Index 2: third? Index 3: fourth? Index 4: fifth.\n\nAlso, we know that O is in the word? But we haven\'t tested other positions? So we must test O at one of 0,1,3,4? And test A at one of 2,3,4? Without interference.\n\nMoreover, we must avoid eliminated letters? So pick other common letters? Such as N, L, C, H, D, etc.\n\nNow, we need to place A at an untried position? So 2,3,4? Similarly O? So positions not 2? So can be 0,1,3,4.\n\nBut note? We have already tried? For A: tried index 1 in RAISE and index 0 in ABOUT? So must try at 2,3, or 4? For O: we tried at index 2? So must try at 0,1,3,4.\n\nTherefore, a good guess would have:\n- A at position 2,3, or 4? And O at one of 0,1,3,4? But avoiding overlap? Such that we can get maximum info.\n\nAdditionally, to avoid? We must include? We have to test both.\n\nAlso, we want to test new common consonants? Like L, N, C, H, P, M, etc.\n\nNow, candidate words:\n\nFirst, A at index 2? Then O at one of the others? Example: ""COMAK""? Not valid? ""GODLY"" but no A? Need A? So must have A.\n\nConsider:\n- O can be at index 0: e.g., ""OAK??"" what? OAKEN? But E not allowed? Or ""OAKUM""? Avoid U? U eliminated? OAKUM has U? Not allowed? ""OAKEN"" has E? Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, O at index 0? Words with O and A? And avoiding eliminated? ""OCEAN"" avoid E? ""OCALA""? O-C-A-L-A? Valid? OCALA? Is it a word? City? But then? Positions: O(0), C(1), A(2), L(3), A(4). But duplicated A? And we have A at positions 2 and 4? But also? We don\'t know? Also feedback: first A? At index 2? Is not previously tested? And A at index 4? Similarly? And O at 0? Which we haven\'t tested.\n\nBut OCALA? Is it accepted? It\'s a proper noun? The problem doesn\'t say? But the word must be English? Common words? But the feedback? We have not been restricted? So perhaps?\n\nBut better to use common words? Something like ""PLANO"": but avoid S? No? But has O? And A? Positions? P-L-A-N-O? So O at index 4? A at index 2? And we avoid eliminated? P,L,A,N,O? Avoids? P,L,N? New? And not prohibited? So yes? ""PLANE""? Avoid E? Not allowed.\n\nSo ""PLANO"": \n- Positions: \n  0: P?\n  1: L?\n  2: A? (we know A can be at 2? So placed there? We\'ll find out)\n  3: N?\n  4: O? \n\nBut O at index 4? We haven\'t tested index 4? So possible? Similarly.\n\nSimilarly, ""COMA?"": COMAE? Not? COMA has 4 letters? Need 5? So COBRA? But R? Avoid? R eliminated? So not.\n\nAnother: ""POHAY""? Not common? Better?\n\nAlternatively, A at index 3? Then? O at 0? 1? or 4? For example, ""FOYAL""? Uncommon? ""LOAM...""? But L-O-A-M-Y? Not valid? ""DOLLY"" no A? Need A? So hard?\n\nA at index 4? Then O? For example, ""????A"" with A at end? And O somewhere? E.g., ""ALCOA""? But duplicated A? And O? Positions: A(0), L(1), C(2), O(3), A(4). But A at 0 and 4? And we used O at 3? But we know A cannot be at 0? Because already tried? So putting A at 0 would be inefficient? And eliminated? Because we know A is not at 0? So the A at 0 would get \'-\', which we already know A is in the word? Worse, it would confuse? Because we don\'t learn new? So better not? So avoid positions that are known to be wrong? Because A at index 0 doesn\'t change? So we get \'-\'? Without learning anything? Same for A at index 1? So we must not put A at index 0 or index 1? In the new guess? Similarly, for O? If we put O at index 2? We know it\'s wrong? So we shouldn\'t put O at index 2? Because we\'ll get \'-\'? Which we already know? Not efficient.\n\nTherefore, in the new guess, we must avoid:\n- A at index 0 or 1?\n- O at index 2?\n\nSo permissible:\n- A at index 2,3,4?\n- O at index 0,1,3,4?\n\nAnd we require the word to include both? And avoid eliminated letters: R,I,S,E,B,U,T? And avoid using the same letter twice? For clarity? Unless necessary.\n\nAdditionally, we want to test new common letters? Such as N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.\n\nCandidate words? With A at index 2? Then O at other allowed positions? \n\nOptions:\n- A at 2: \n  - O at index 0: e.g., ""O P A ??""\n    - Word: ""OPAHS""? O-P-A-H-S? Avoid S? S eliminated? Invalid? ""OPACT""? Not valid?\n  - O at index 1: e.g., ""? O A ? ?"" \n    - ""COATH""? Avoid H? Not valid? ""GOADS"" avoid S? ""GOLEM"" no A? \n    - ""DOGAN""? Not known? Try L? ""LOAVY""? No? \n\nAlternatively, A at index 3? Then? O at 0? ""O??A?"" \n\nSimilarly, ""OLGA?"" no A? ""CONGA"" avoid N? No? CONGA: C,O,N,G,A? Positions: C(0), O(1), N(2), G(3), A(4)? But then O at index 1? Which is permissible? And A at index 4? Which we haven\'t tested? So A at 4? And O at 1? \n\nBut letters: C,O,N,G? N? What? CONGA: C(0), O(1), N(2), G(3), A(4). \n\nNow, is CONGA valid? English word? Meaning drum dance? Yes? \n\nValid? Also, avoids? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? \n\nSimilarly, O at index 3? And other? \n\nBut CONGA: \n- O is placed at index 1? \n- A at index 4? \n\nBoth positions? Are we testing O at index 1? Which is new? Because we only tested O at index 2? Similarly? A at 4?

Good. \n\nBut another candidate: ""POLKA""? But avoid K and O? Position? P O L K A? O at 1? A at 4? Similarly? But K? Can? But POLKA? Is valid? But letters P,O,L,K,A? Avoids? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? \n\nBut K? Not common? So CONGA better? G? Less common? \n\nBut CONGA tests C? N? G? \n\nPLANO tests P? L? N? \n\nWhich is better? L? More common than G? \n\nLetter frequencies?

What about? ""CANOLI""? Too long? \n\nAnother word: ""MANGO""? But? M A N G O? Positions: M(0), A(1), N(2), G(3), O(4)? But wait? We cannot put A at index 1?

I choose PLANO? \n\nSo <guess>PLANO</guess>### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n\n1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1: RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)**:\n     - Eliminates **R, I, S, E** from the word: They are not present.\n     - **A** is in the secret word but not at position 1 (index 1).\n   - **Guess 2: ABOUT → A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)**:\n     - Eliminates **B, U, T** from the word: They are not present.\n     - **A** is confirmed in the word but not at position 0 (index 0). Combined with Guess 1, A cannot be at positions 0 or 1, so possible positions are 2, 3, or 4.\n     - **O** is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2), leaving possible positions 0, 1, 3, or 4.\n   - **Collective Eliminations**: Secret word cannot contain **R, I, S, E, B, U, T**. This leaves available letters: A, O, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n   - **Inclusions**: Secret word **must include A and O**, as both received ""-"" (misplaced) feedback, confirming their presence.\n\n2. **Constraints for New Guess**:\n   - The word must include **A and O**.\n   - **A** must be placed at an **untested position**: index 2, 3, or 4 (not 0 or 1).\n   - **O** must be placed at an **untested position**: index 0, 1, 3, or 4 (not 2).\n   - Avoid using eliminated letters: **R, I, S, E, B, U, T**.\n   - Prioritize distinct letters to test new positions and maximize information.\n   - Focus on testing high-frequency consonants like **L, N, P, M, C** (among the top 20 English letters) for better coverage.\n\n3. **Candidate Word Selection**:\n   - Words considered:\n     - **""PLANO""**: A at index 2, O at index 4. Tests new positions and includes common letters (P, L, N). Valid English word (city/hobby meaning).\n     - **""CONGA""**: A at index 4, O at index 1. Also tests new positions and includes common letters (C, N, G), but G is less frequent.\n     - **""MOCHA""**: A at index 4, O at index 1. Tests M, C, H, but frequencies are moderate.\n     - **""NOMAD""**: A at index 3, O at index 1. Tests N, M, D, which are common.\n   - **Choice Rationale**: ""PLANO"" is chosen because:\n     - Places **A at index 2** (new position) and **O at index 4** (new position), testing both for potential correctness.\n     - Includes high-frequency consonants: **L** (9th most common), **N** (7th), and **P** (19th).\n     - Avoids duplicates or eliminated letters and maximizes new letter coverage.\n     - Efficiently narrows down positions for A and O based on feedback.\n     - Valid English word (recognized in dictionaries).\n\n4. **Expected Feedback Insights**:\n   - **Position Testing**: Response for A at index 2 may reveal if it is correct (✓) or misplaced (-), pinning down its position. Similarly for O at 4.\n   - **Letter Testing**: Feedback for P, L, N will help eliminate or confirm new letters, reducing the word pool significantly.\n   - On incorrect placement, constraints tighten for subsequent guesses (e.g., A locked to index 3 or 4).\n\nThus, ""PLANO"" strategically leverages known constraints, maximizes information gain, and adheres to the rules.\n\n<guess>PLANO</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: PLANO -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) O(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Meaning:
  R: not in the word
  A: in the word but not in position 1 (index 1)
  I: not in the word
  S: not in the word
  E: not in the word

Guess 2: ABOUT -> A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)
Meaning:
  A: in the word but not in position 0 (index 0) -> so A is not at 0 or 1
  B: not in the word
  O: in the word but not in position 2 (index 2)
  U: not in the word
  T: not in the word

Guess 3: PLANO -> P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) O(-)
Meaning:
  P: not in the word
  L: in the word but not in position 1 (index 1) of the guess (which is the second letter)
  A: in the word but not in position 2 (index 2) of the guess (which is the third letter)
  N: not in the word
  O: in the word but not in position 4 (index 4) of the guess (which is the fifth letter)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Letters that are in the word: 
   - A (from multiple guesses)
   - O (from ABOUT and PLANO)
   - L (from PLANO)

   We also know that A, O, and L are present.

2. Letters that are not in the word (from all feedback):
   - R, I, S, E (from RAISE)
   - B, U, T (from ABOUT)
   - P, N (from PLANO)

   So eliminated: R, I, S, E, B, U, T, P, N.

3. Positions for A:
   - Not at index 0 (from ABOUT: A at 0 was -)
   - Not at index 1 (from RAISE: A at 1 was -)
   - Not at index 2 (from PLANO: A at 2 was -)
   So A must be at index 3 or 4.

4. Positions for O:
   - Not at index 2 (from ABOUT: O at 2 was -)
   - Not at index 4 (from PLANO: O at 4 was -)
   So O must be at index 0, 1, or 3.

5. Positions for L:
   - From PLANO: L was at index 1 and got '-', meaning L is in the word but not at index 1.
   So L is not at index 1, and must be at index 0, 2, 3, or 4.

We also know the word has 5 letters and must include A, O, L, and two other letters that are not eliminated.

Available letters (not eliminated): 
A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: A, O, L are already in the word, so we need to choose two more from the remaining: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have constraints on positions.

Let's consider the possible positions for A, O, and L.

A: only 3 or 4.
O: 0, 1, or 3. But note: if O is at 3, then A cannot be at 3 (since one letter per position). Similarly, if A is at 3, then O cannot be at 3. So they cannot both be at 3.

Possible cases:

Case 1: A at 3, then O at 0 or 1 (since O cannot be at 3 and 4 is taken by A? No, A is at 3, so O can be at 0,1, or 4? But wait, O cannot be at 4 because in PLANO we had O at 4 and it was '-', so O is not at 4. Therefore, if A is at 3, then O must be at 0 or 1.

Case 2: A at 4, then O can be at 0, 1, or 3.

Also, L must be placed at one of 0,2,3,4 but not conflicting with A and O.

We need to form a word that satisfies these.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's list possible words:

First, if A is at 3 (position 4th letter) and O at 0 (first) or 1 (second):

- O at 0, A at 3: then the word is O _ _ A _
  We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 4 (index 1,2,4). Also, L must be in one of these? Or at 3? But A is at 3, so L cannot be at 3. So L must be at 0,1,2,4. But 0 is O, so L must be at 1,2, or 4.

  Example: 
    Position 0: O
    Position 3: A
    Then we have positions 1,2,4 to fill, and one of them must be L (and the other two are new letters).

  Possible words: 
    O _ _ A L -> but then L is at 4? So word: O??AL
    What letters? We have to use two new letters from available (C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z) and L.

  Examples: 
    ""OCEAN"" -> but E and N are eliminated -> invalid.
    ""OCAL?"" -> not a word? 
    ""OFAAL"" -> not a word.

  Alternatively, L at position 1: O L _ A _ -> then we need to fill 2 and 4. 
    Example: ""OLGA?"" -> not 5 letters? ""OLDAE"" -> E eliminated. ""OLDAM"" -> M? But then O L D A M? Is that a word? Not common. 

  Or L at position 2: O _ L A _ -> then we need to fill 1 and 4. 
    Example: ""O W L A Y"" -> OWL? But OWLAY? Not a word. ""O F L A G"" -> FLAG? But O F L A G -> ""OFLAG"" not a word? 

  This seems difficult. 

Second, if A is at 3 and O at 1: 
  Then word: _ O _ A _
  Positions: 0,2,4 to fill, and one must be L (at 0,2, or 4).

  Example: L at 0: L O _ A _ -> then we need to fill 2 and 4. 
    ""L O C A L"" -> but L repeated? And we don't know if L is repeated? But in PLANO, we had only one L? But the secret word might have two L's? However, in PLANO, the L was at index 1 and got '-', meaning at least one L is present. But it could be more? So ""LOCAL"" has two L's? But we have eliminated letters? C is available? But ""LOCAL"" has L at 0 and 4? 

    But note: we have to avoid eliminated letters? ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L? But L is repeated? And we are allowed? But the feedback for PLANO only told us that L is present (at least one) but not the count. So ""LOCAL"" is possible? 

    However, we have to check: 
      Position 0: L -> if the secret word has L at 0? Then we get ✓? 
      Position 1: O -> we know O is at 1? Then we get ✓? 
      But we don't know if O is at 1? We are testing it.

    But ""LOCAL"" is a valid word? Yes.

    But we have to see if it fits: 
      A is at 3? Yes.
      O at 1? Yes.
      L at 0 and 4? 

    But we know L is present? And we are testing two L's? The feedback will tell us if there are two? 

    However, we are trying to form a guess? So we can use ""LOCAL""? 

    But note: we have eliminated N, so no problem? 

    But let's see the letters: L, O, C, A, L? 
    C is new? 

    But we are allowed? 

    Alternatively, without repetition? 

  But let's see if there are other words? 

  If L at 2: _ O L A _ -> then we need to fill 0 and 4. 
    Example: ""C O L A H"" -> ""COLAH"" not a word? ""D O L A M"" -> ""DOLAM"" not a word? 

  If L at 4: _ O _ A L -> then we need to fill 0 and 2. 
    Example: ""H O G A L"" -> ""HOGAL"" not a word? ""F O Y A L"" -> not a word? 

So ""LOCAL"" is a candidate? 

Now, the other case: A at 4 (last letter) and O at 0,1, or 3.

- If O at 0 and A at 4: then word: O _ _ _ A
  Then L must be at 1,2,3 (since 0 is O, 4 is A). 
  Example: O L _ _ A -> ""OLIVA"" -> but I is eliminated? ""OLEMA"" -> E eliminated? ""OLAMA"" -> not a word? 

- If O at 1 and A at 4: then word: _ O _ _ A
  Then L must be at 0,2,3. 
  Example: L O _ _ A -> ""LOCA?"" -> ""LOCA"" is 4 letters? ""LOCAL"" we considered? But in ""LOCAL"", A is at 3? Not at 4? 

  We need A at 4: so _ O _ _ A -> 
    L at 0: L O _ _ A -> ""L O C H A"" -> ""LOCHA""? Not common? ""L O G A A"" -> not? 

  Or L at 2: _ O L _ A -> ""C O L Z A"" -> not? ""G O L D A"" -> ""GOLDA""? Not a word? 

  Or L at 3: _ O _ L A -> ""C O M L A"" -> ""COMLA""? Not? 

- If O at 3 and A at 4: then word: _ _ _ O A
  Then L must be at 0,1,2. 
  Example: L _ _ O A -> ""L A V O A"" -> not? 
           _ L _ O A -> ""A L ? O A"" -> but A at 0? We know A is not at 0? So cannot? 
           _ _ L O A -> ""C A L O A"" -> not? ""K Y L O A"" -> not? 

This seems difficult? 

Alternatively, we have the case where A is at 4 and O at 1? We tried? 

But we have a candidate: ""LOCAL"" for the case A at 3 and O at 1? 

But in ""LOCAL"", A is at 3? and O at 1? 

But we also have the possibility of A at 4? 

But we found no good words for A at 4? 

Another candidate: if A is at 4 and O at 0? 

But we tried? 

What about O at 3 and A at 4? 

We need a word: _ _ _ O A

And L must be at 0,1, or 2. 

Example: 
  L at 0: L _ _ O A -> ""L A V O A"" -> invalid? 
  L at 1: _ L _ O A -> ""A L ? O A"" -> but A at 0? Not allowed? 
  L at 2: _ _ L O A -> ""C A L O A"" -> not? 

But ""K Y L O A"" not a word? 

What about ""ALAMO""? But A at 0? Not allowed? 

Another idea: ""DOGMA""? But D O G M A? 
  Positions: 
    0: D? 
    1: O? 
    2: G? 
    3: M? 
    4: A? 
But then A at 4? and O at 1? 
And we avoid eliminated? D, O, G, M, A? 
But we know L is in the word? But ""DOGMA"" has no L? So it cannot be? Because we know L is present? 

So we must include L? 

Therefore, the word must have A, O, and L? 

So back to ""LOCAL"": 
  It has A at 3? and O at 1? and L at 0 and 4? 
  But we know L is present? And it has two L's? That's acceptable? 

  Also, it has C? which is new? 

  And it fits: 
    A at 3? -> we haven't tested A at 3? 
    O at 1? -> we haven't tested O at 1? 
    L at 0 and 4? -> we haven't tested L at 0 or 4? 

  So we can test multiple things? 

  But note: in PLANO, we tested L at index 1? and got '-'? meaning L is present but not at 1? So if we put L at 0? we might get ✓ or '-'? 

  Similarly, O at 1? we don't know? 

  So ""LOCAL"" is a valid candidate? 

But is there a word with distinct letters? 

Another candidate: ""LOACH""? 
  L O A C H? 
  But then A at 2? But we know A cannot be at 2? (from PLANO: A at 2 was -? and we know it's not at 2) -> so if we put A at 2? we get '-'? which we already know? So inefficient? 

  Also, O at 1? which is new? 

  But A at 2? is redundant? 

  So not good? 

Another: ""LOHAN""? but N eliminated? 

""LOFAM""? not a word? 

So ""LOCAL"" seems a good candidate? 

But let's check the feedback we would get if the word is not ""LOCAL""? 

We are guessing to get information? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have A at 3? to test the other case? 

But we have to cover the possibilities? 

Since A can only be at 3 or 4? and we haven't tested 3? we can test A at 3? 

Similarly, O at 1? we haven't tested? 

Also, we need to test L? 

But in ""LOCAL"", we test L at 0 and 4? 

But we might get ambiguous feedback? 

Another word: ""COMA?"" -> but 4 letters? 

""COALA""? but A at 4? and O at 1? and L at 3? 
  C O M A L? -> ""COMAL"" is a word? (a type of pan) 
  But then A at 3? and L at 4? 
  So positions: 
    0: C
    1: O
    2: M
    3: A
    4: L

  This has A at 3? and O at 1? and L at 4? 
  And no duplicate letters? 

  And letters: C, O, M, A, L? 
  M and C are new? 

  This is better? Because no duplicate? 

  And it fits: 
    A at 3? -> new position? 
    O at 1? -> new position? 
    L at 4? -> new position? 

  And we avoid eliminated letters? 

  So ""COMAL"" is a valid word? 

  Let me confirm: COMAL is a word? Yes, a flat griddle used in Mexico.

  So we can use ""COMAL"".

  This tests:
    C at 0? 
    O at 1? 
    M at 2? 
    A at 3? 
    L at 4? 

  And we get feedback on each? 

  This seems better than ""LOCAL"" because it tests distinct letters and new positions for A, O, L.

So I choose ""COMAL"".

But note: we know O is in the word? and we are putting it at 1? which is a possible position? 

Similarly, A at 3? which is possible? 

L at 4? which is possible? 

And we test C and M? 

So let's go with that.

   - **A** is in the word but **not at position 1** (index 1).  

2. **Guess 2: ABOUT → A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)**

### Consolidated Insights
- **Confirmed Letters in Secret Word**:  
  - **A** (must be at index 3 or 4, since ruled out at 0, 1, 2).  
  - **O** (must be at index 0, 1, or 3, since ruled out at 2 and 4).  
  - **L** (must be at index 0, 2, 3, or 4, since ruled out at 1).  
- **Eliminated Letters**: R, I, S, E, B, U, T, P, N (cannot appear).  
- **Available Letters**: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - A and O cannot share position 3 (only one letter per position).  
  - The word must include **A, O, L** and two additional letters from the available pool.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Test Untested Positions**:  
  - **A**: Only positions 3 or 4 left (test position 3 in this guess).  
  - **O**: Positions 0, 1, or 3 left (test position 1 in this guess).  
  - **L**: Positions 0, 2, 3, or 4 left (test position 4 in this guess).  
- **Maximize Information**: Use a word with **distinct new letters** to test high-frequency consonants (e.g., C, M) and avoid redundancy.  
- **Word Selection**:  
  - **COMAL** (valid English word: a type of griddle):  
    - **C** at index 0 (new letter).  
    - **O** at index 1 (tests untested position).  
    - **M** at index 2 (new letter).  
    - **A** at index 3 (tests untested position).  
    - **L** at index 4 (tests untested position).  
  - **Why COMAL?**  
    - Tests all critical constraints (A at 3, O at 1, L at 4).  
    - Uses new common consonants (C, M) for broader coverage.  
    - Avoids eliminated letters and positional redundancies.  

### Expected Feedback Insights
- **A at 3**: If ✓, confirms position; if -, A must be at 4.  
- **O at 1**: If ✓, confirms position; if -, O must be at 0 or 3.  
- **L at 4**: If ✓, confirms position; if -, L must be at 0, 2, or 3.  
- **C and M**: Feedback will confirm presence/absence, narrowing the pool.  

<guess>COMAL</guess>",COMAL,"We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Meaning:
  R: not in the word
  A: in the word but not in position 1 (index 1)
  I: not in the word
  S: not in the word
  E: not in the word

Guess 2: ABOUT -> A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)
Meaning:
  A: in the word but not in position 0 (index 0) -> so A is not at 0 or 1
  B: not in the word
  O: in the word but not in position 2 (index 2)
  U: not in the word
  T: not in the word

Guess 3: PLANO -> P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) O(-)
Meaning:
  P: not in the word
  L: in the word but not in position 1 (index 1) of the guess (which is the second letter)
  A: in the word but not in position 2 (index 2) of the guess (which is the third letter)
  N: not in the word
  O: in the word but not in position 4 (index 4) of the guess (which is the fifth letter)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Letters that are in the word: 
   - A (from multiple guesses)
   - O (from ABOUT and PLANO)
   - L (from PLANO)

   We also know that A, O, and L are present.

2. Letters that are not in the word (from all feedback):
   - R, I, S, E (from RAISE)
   - B, U, T (from ABOUT)
   - P, N (from PLANO)

   So eliminated: R, I, S, E, B, U, T, P, N.

3. Positions for A:
   - Not at index 0 (from ABOUT: A at 0 was -)
   - Not at index 1 (from RAISE: A at 1 was -)
   - Not at index 2 (from PLANO: A at 2 was -)
   So A must be at index 3 or 4.

4. Positions for O:
   - Not at index 2 (from ABOUT: O at 2 was -)
   - Not at index 4 (from PLANO: O at 4 was -)
   So O must be at index 0, 1, or 3.

5. Positions for L:
   - From PLANO: L was at index 1 and got '-', meaning L is in the word but not at index 1.
   So L is not at index 1, and must be at index 0, 2, 3, or 4.

We also know the word has 5 letters and must include A, O, L, and two other letters that are not eliminated.

Available letters (not eliminated): 
A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: A, O, L are already in the word, so we need to choose two more from the remaining: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have constraints on positions.

Let's consider the possible positions for A, O, and L.

A: only 3 or 4.
O: 0, 1, or 3. But note: if O is at 3, then A cannot be at 3 (since one letter per position). Similarly, if A is at 3, then O cannot be at 3. So they cannot both be at 3.

Possible cases:

Case 1: A at 3, then O at 0 or 1 (since O cannot be at 3 and 4 is taken by A? No, A is at 3, so O can be at 0,1, or 4? But wait, O cannot be at 4 because in PLANO we had O at 4 and it was '-', so O is not at 4. Therefore, if A is at 3, then O must be at 0 or 1.

Case 2: A at 4, then O can be at 0, 1, or 3.

Also, L must be placed at one of 0,2,3,4 but not conflicting with A and O.

We need to form a word that satisfies these.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's list possible words:

First, if A is at 3 (position 4th letter) and O at 0 (first) or 1 (second):

- O at 0, A at 3: then the word is O _ _ A _
  We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 4 (index 1,2,4). Also, L must be in one of these? Or at 3? But A is at 3, so L cannot be at 3. So L must be at 0,1,2,4. But 0 is O, so L must be at 1,2, or 4.

  Example: 
    Position 0: O
    Position 3: A
    Then we have positions 1,2,4 to fill, and one of them must be L (and the other two are new letters).

  Possible words: 
    O _ _ A L -> but then L is at 4? So word: O??AL
    What letters? We have to use two new letters from available (C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z) and L.

  Examples: 
    ""OCEAN"" -> but E and N are eliminated -> invalid.
    ""OCAL?"" -> not a word? 
    ""OFAAL"" -> not a word.

  Alternatively, L at position 1: O L _ A _ -> then we need to fill 2 and 4. 
    Example: ""OLGA?"" -> not 5 letters? ""OLDAE"" -> E eliminated. ""OLDAM"" -> M? But then O L D A M? Is that a word? Not common. 

  Or L at position 2: O _ L A _ -> then we need to fill 1 and 4. 
    Example: ""O W L A Y"" -> OWL? But OWLAY? Not a word. ""O F L A G"" -> FLAG? But O F L A G -> ""OFLAG"" not a word? 

  This seems difficult. 

Second, if A is at 3 and O at 1: 
  Then word: _ O _ A _
  Positions: 0,2,4 to fill, and one must be L (at 0,2, or 4).

  Example: L at 0: L O _ A _ -> then we need to fill 2 and 4. 
    ""L O C A L"" -> but L repeated? And we don't know if L is repeated? But in PLANO, we had only one L? But the secret word might have two L's? However, in PLANO, the L was at index 1 and got '-', meaning at least one L is present. But it could be more? So ""LOCAL"" has two L's? But we have eliminated letters? C is available? But ""LOCAL"" has L at 0 and 4? 

    But note: we have to avoid eliminated letters? ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L? But L is repeated? And we are allowed? But the feedback for PLANO only told us that L is present (at least one) but not the count. So ""LOCAL"" is possible? 

    However, we have to check: 
      Position 0: L -> if the secret word has L at 0? Then we get ✓? 
      Position 1: O -> we know O is at 1? Then we get ✓? 
      But we don't know if O is at 1? We are testing it.

    But ""LOCAL"" is a valid word? Yes.

    But we have to see if it fits: 
      A is at 3? Yes.
      O at 1? Yes.
      L at 0 and 4? 

    But we know L is present? And we are testing two L's? The feedback will tell us if there are two? 

    However, we are trying to form a guess? So we can use ""LOCAL""? 

    But note: we have eliminated N, so no problem? 

    But let's see the letters: L, O, C, A, L? 
    C is new? 

    But we are allowed? 

    Alternatively, without repetition? 

  But let's see if there are other words? 

  If L at 2: _ O L A _ -> then we need to fill 0 and 4. 
    Example: ""C O L A H"" -> ""COLAH"" not a word? ""D O L A M"" -> ""DOLAM"" not a word? 

  If L at 4: _ O _ A L -> then we need to fill 0 and 2. 
    Example: ""H O G A L"" -> ""HOGAL"" not a word? ""F O Y A L"" -> not a word? 

So ""LOCAL"" is a candidate? 

Now, the other case: A at 4 (last letter) and O at 0,1, or 3.

- If O at 0 and A at 4: then word: O _ _ _ A
  Then L must be at 1,2,3 (since 0 is O, 4 is A). 
  Example: O L _ _ A -> ""OLIVA"" -> but I is eliminated? ""OLEMA"" -> E eliminated? ""OLAMA"" -> not a word? 

- If O at 1 and A at 4: then word: _ O _ _ A
  Then L must be at 0,2,3. 
  Example: L O _ _ A -> ""LOCA?"" -> ""LOCA"" is 4 letters? ""LOCAL"" we considered? But in ""LOCAL"", A is at 3? Not at 4? 

  We need A at 4: so _ O _ _ A -> 
    L at 0: L O _ _ A -> ""L O C H A"" -> ""LOCHA""? Not common? ""L O G A A"" -> not? 

  Or L at 2: _ O L _ A -> ""C O L Z A"" -> not? ""G O L D A"" -> ""GOLDA""? Not a word? 

  Or L at 3: _ O _ L A -> ""C O M L A"" -> ""COMLA""? Not? 

- If O at 3 and A at 4: then word: _ _ _ O A
  Then L must be at 0,1,2. 
  Example: L _ _ O A -> ""L A V O A"" -> not? 
           _ L _ O A -> ""A L ? O A"" -> but A at 0? We know A is not at 0? So cannot? 
           _ _ L O A -> ""C A L O A"" -> not? ""K Y L O A"" -> not? 

This seems difficult? 

Alternatively, we have the case where A is at 4 and O at 1? We tried? 

But we have a candidate: ""LOCAL"" for the case A at 3 and O at 1? 

But in ""LOCAL"", A is at 3? and O at 1? 

But we also have the possibility of A at 4? 

But we found no good words for A at 4? 

Another candidate: if A is at 4 and O at 0? 

But we tried? 

What about O at 3 and A at 4? 

We need a word: _ _ _ O A

And L must be at 0,1, or 2. 

Example: 
  L at 0: L _ _ O A -> ""L A V O A"" -> invalid? 
  L at 1: _ L _ O A -> ""A L ? O A"" -> but A at 0? Not allowed? 
  L at 2: _ _ L O A -> ""C A L O A"" -> not? 

But ""K Y L O A"" not a word? 

What about ""ALAMO""? But A at 0? Not allowed? 

Another idea: ""DOGMA""? But D O G M A? 
  Positions: 
    0: D? 
    1: O? 
    2: G? 
    3: M? 
    4: A? 
But then A at 4? and O at 1? 
And we avoid eliminated? D, O, G, M, A? 
But we know L is in the word? But ""DOGMA"" has no L? So it cannot be? Because we know L is present? 

So we must include L? 

Therefore, the word must have A, O, and L? 

So back to ""LOCAL"": 
  It has A at 3? and O at 1? and L at 0 and 4? 
  But we know L is present? And it has two L's? That's acceptable? 

  Also, it has C? which is new? 

  And it fits: 
    A at 3? -> we haven't tested A at 3? 
    O at 1? -> we haven't tested O at 1? 
    L at 0 and 4? -> we haven't tested L at 0 or 4? 

  So we can test multiple things? 

  But note: in PLANO, we tested L at index 1? and got '-'? meaning L is present but not at 1? So if we put L at 0? we might get ✓ or '-'? 

  Similarly, O at 1? we don't know? 

  So ""LOCAL"" is a valid candidate? 

But is there a word with distinct letters? 

Another candidate: ""LOACH""? 
  L O A C H? 
  But then A at 2? But we know A cannot be at 2? (from PLANO: A at 2 was -? and we know it's not at 2) -> so if we put A at 2? we get '-'? which we already know? So inefficient? 

  Also, O at 1? which is new? 

  But A at 2? is redundant? 

  So not good? 

Another: ""LOHAN""? but N eliminated? 

""LOFAM""? not a word? 

So ""LOCAL"" seems a good candidate? 

But let's check the feedback we would get if the word is not ""LOCAL""? 

We are guessing to get information? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have A at 3? to test the other case? 

But we have to cover the possibilities? 

Since A can only be at 3 or 4? and we haven't tested 3? we can test A at 3? 

Similarly, O at 1? we haven't tested? 

Also, we need to test L? 

But in ""LOCAL"", we test L at 0 and 4? 

But we might get ambiguous feedback? 

Another word: ""COMA?"" -> but 4 letters? 

""COALA""? but A at 4? and O at 1? and L at 3? 
  C O M A L? -> ""COMAL"" is a word? (a type of pan) 
  But then A at 3? and L at 4? 
  So positions: 
    0: C
    1: O
    2: M
    3: A
    4: L

  This has A at 3? and O at 1? and L at 4? 
  And no duplicate letters? 

  And letters: C, O, M, A, L? 
  M and C are new? 

  This is better? Because no duplicate? 

  And it fits: 
    A at 3? -> new position? 
    O at 1? -> new position? 
    L at 4? -> new position? 

  And we avoid eliminated letters? 

  So ""COMAL"" is a valid word? 

  Let me confirm: COMAL is a word? Yes, a flat griddle used in Mexico.

  So we can use ""COMAL"".

  This tests:
    C at 0? 
    O at 1? 
    M at 2? 
    A at 3? 
    L at 4? 

  And we get feedback on each? 

  This seems better than ""LOCAL"" because it tests distinct letters and new positions for A, O, L.

So I choose ""COMAL"".

But note: we know O is in the word? and we are putting it at 1? which is a possible position? 

Similarly, A at 3? which is possible? 

L at 4? which is possible? 

And we test C and M? 

So let's go with that.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get back (i.e., covers common letters and positions).
Common starting words in similar games (like Wordle) often include words with a mix of frequent consonants and vowels. 
A good starting word should have:
- No repeated letters (so we can test more letters)
- Common letters: e.g., vowels like A, E, I, O and consonants like R, S, T, L, N

A common choice is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But note the rules: the word must be a valid English word.

Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it covers:
- C: a common consonant
- R: a common consonant
- A: a vowel
- N: a common consonant
- E: a common vowel

However, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we are free to choose any starting word.

Alternatively, we can use ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word albeit uncommon) for high frequency? But let's stick to a common word.

Another popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has R, A, I, S, E - all of which are very common.

Let me choose ""RAISE"" because:

- R, S: very common consonants
- A, E: vowels
- I: also a vowel

It covers many common letters.

But note: since the example word was ""BRISK"", we don't want to be biased by that. We are making a blind first guess.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also great: S, L, A, T, E.

I think ""SLATE"" is a very solid first guess because:

- S and T are among the most common consonants
- L is also common
- A and E are vowels

So I choose ""SLATE"".

However, note that the rules allow any valid English word. Let me confirm ""slate"" is valid: yes, meaning a thin piece of rock or a verb meaning schedule.

Therefore, my first guess is SLATE.

But wait, the example in the problem used words like ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"", so we know these are words that the game accepts. We are free to choose any valid word.

I think I'll go with ""CRATE"" because:

- C, R, T: common consonants
- A, E: vowels

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also common and has C, R, A, N, E.

But note: the letter N is slightly more common than T? According to letter frequencies in English:

E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C ...

So having either T or N is fine.

I recall that ""ROATE"" is sometimes used by enthusiasts (it's a valid word meaning the accumulated result of growth) but it might be considered obscure. We should stick to common words.

Therefore, I choose ""SLATE"" as it covers more top letters: S (7th most common), L (8th), A (2nd), T (5th), E (1st).

So let's go with ""SLATE"".

But note: the example word BRISK has no S? Actually it does: BRISK has S! However, in the example guess ""STORM"" gave feedback for S as '-' meaning it exists but in wrong place? No, in the example:

Secret: BRISK
Guess: STORM -> S is in BRISK? The positions: 
BRISK: position 4 is S? Actually: B-R-I-S-K -> S is at index 3 (if starting index 0).
STORM: S at index 0, which is not 3 -> so '-' is correct.

So S in STORM was indeed in the word but wrong place? Wait, note BRISK does have an S? Actually BRISK: letters B,R,I,S,K -> yes, it has S.

But that we don't know initially.

So I'm sticking with SLATE.

Alternatively, to avoid duplicate letters and maximize distinct common letters, I'll use ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

It's also a word the game will have.

So I'll go with ""CRANE"".

But let me check: CRANE: C is 12th, R is 3rd?, A is 2nd?, N is 6th, E is 1st? Roughly.

Frequency order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L, D, U, C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q, J, Z.

So: 
E:1, A:3? Actually:

Typical frequencies: 
E: 11.16%, A: 8.49%, R: 7.58%, I: 7.54%, O: 7.16%, T: 6.95%, N: 6.65%, S: 5.73%, L: 5.48%, C: 4.54%

So:
E: 1st, T: 6th, A: 2nd, O: 5th, I: 4th, N: 7th, S: 8th, R: 3rd, C: 10th? (ranks vary slightly by corpus)

We want higher frequency? Actually, the combination matters.

But note: we don't know which position they are in, so the distribution across the word also matters? Not at first guess.

But a balanced starting word.

I think both are good. I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:

R: 3rd
A: 2nd
I: 4th
S: 8th
E: 1st

So 5 letters from the top 8? Not exactly: S is 8, E is 1, A 2, R 3, I 4? Yes, top 8. 

Similarly, ""SLATE"": S(8), L(9), A(2), T(6), E(1) -> top 9? L is 9th? 
But note: in the frequency list above, L is 9th? Yes.

Actually ""RAISE"" has higher average rank? 

RAISE: E, A, R, I, S -> ranks: 1,2,3,4,8 -> average: (1+2+3+4+8)/5=18/5=3.6

SLATE: E(1), L(9), A(2), T(6), S(8) -> average: (1+9+2+6+8)/5=26/5=5.2

So RAISE has a better letter frequency average?

But also, we want to cover vowel and consonant positions.

Alternatively, ""SOARE"" is a falconry term (uncommon) or ""ALTER"" has repeated T? No, ALTER: A,L,T,E,R -> distinct? Yes.

But ALTER: A,L,T,E,R -> ranks 2,9,6,1,3 -> average: (2+9+6+1+3)/5=21/5=4.2

So RAISE seems slightly better.

I'll use ""RAISE"".

So my first guess is ""RAISE"".

But note: the example used ""BRAVE"" and others. We don't know the word set? Actually, the secret word will be a valid English word, presumably common? The problem says a valid English word.

Also, ""raise"" is very common.

So let's go with RAISE.

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" might be better? It has N which is 7th? And not in RAISE? But RAISE has I which is 4th? It's a trade-off.

But I think I have decision fatigue. ""RAISE"" is a fine starting word.

Final decision: RAISE.I am making my first guess with no prior information. To maximize the feedback I receive, I should choose a word that includes common letters and distinct vowels and consonants to cover as many possibilities as possible. Common starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are often used because they include high-frequency letters and reduce redundancy.

After considering:
- **Letter frequency**: English letter frequencies rank E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, and L among the top. A good starting word includes several of these.
- **Diversity**: Avoid repeated letters to test more letters.
- **Balanced vowels and consonants**: Aim for 2-3 vowels and the rest consonants for broader coverage.

""RAISE"" is chosen because:
- It includes five distinct letters: R (3rd most common), A (2nd), I (4th), S (8th), and E (1st).
- It covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- It has a high average letter frequency rank, which is favorable for early information.
- ""RAISE"" is a common English word, so it is valid.

This guess will provide feedback on which letters are present or not, helping narrow down the secret word for subsequent guesses.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The secret word does not contain R, I, S, or E.
2. The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in RAISE, A is the second letter and we got '-', meaning present but not in that position).

Therefore, the secret word must contain A, but at a position other than the second. The positions are:
- Index 0: first letter
- Index 1: second letter (so A cannot be here)
- Index 2: third letter
- Index 3: fourth letter
- Index 4: fifth letter

Also, we must avoid using the letters R, I, S, E in our new guess.

Therefore, the new guess must:
- Be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Include the letter A, but not in position 1 (index 1).
- Avoid letters R, I, S, E entirely.

Additionally, to maximize information, we should use:
- Common consonants that are still possibilities, such as T, N, O, L, C, etc.
- Other vowels: O, U are possible since we haven't tried them (A is confirmed present).

Available letters: We have used R, A, I, S, E. So we know A is in the word, so we should reuse it in the new word but not at position 1. The rest of the letters should come from unguessed letters.

Since the secret word has exactly 5 letters and we have eliminated R, I, S, E, the remaining letters to use are from the rest of the alphabet without R, I, S, E.

Also note: the secret word must have A somewhere, so we must include A in our new guess but at a position that is not 1 (index 1).

Possible positions for A: index 0, 2, 3, or 4.

We must choose a word that fits the criteria and contains A in one of these positions, and the other four letters should be new (excluding R, I, S, E).

We should also aim for words with high-frequency letters to test them. Common letters left: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's brainstorm words that:
- Do not contain R, I, S, E.
- Contain A, but not in the second position.

For example:
- If A is at position 0: words like ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""ADMIT"", but note we have to avoid R, I, S, E: 
  - ""ABOUT"": contains B, O, U, T. Avoids R,I,S,E? Yes. And A is at 0. So valid? But let's check: positions: A at 0 (allowed), B, O, U, T. But we must avoid S? Yes, so ABOUT is acceptable? It contains O, U, T, and B. But note: the secret word contains A, but we don't know if it contains O, U, etc. This is a valid guess.
- Alternatively, A at position 2: e.g., ""TRACK"", but has R and S? Avoid R and S -> not allowed.
- Another word: ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O. A is at position 1? In ""MANGO"", positions: M(0), A(1), N(2), G(3), O(4). We cannot have A at position 1, so this is invalid for our guess? Because we know A cannot be at index 1. So we must not put A at index 1.

Therefore, we look for words with A at indices 0,2,3,4.

Examples of A at index 0: ABOUT, ABOVE (but E? Avoid E -> not allowed), ACTED (E? Avoid), ADAPT (avoid S? S not here? E? No, but D and P). ADAPT: A at 0, then D,A,P,T? No: A-D-A-P-T -> waits, ADAPT? It has A at 0 and 2? But we are allowed? We are forced to put A only where we guess? Actually, we are allowed to have A only at one position? No, a word can have multiple A's? But in the feedback, we know that A is present at least once, but it might be multiple? Since we are not limited.

But in our guess, we are free to put A wherever we want? Even if the word might have multiple A's? Yes, but the feedback will tell us.

However, we have to avoid letters R,I,S,E anywhere.

So for index 0 A: 
Candidate: ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> letters: A (at 0), B (new), O (new), U (new), T (new). Avoids R,I,S,E. So valid.

Another: ""ADULT"": A,D,U,L,T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. A at 0.

But position 1 is D? That is allowed. We have to put A in positions other than 1? We are placing A at 0, so that is okay.

But also, we can try with A at other positions.

A at index 2: e.g., ""PLANT"": P,L,A,N,T -> A at index 2? Positions: P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes.

But note: we don't know if A is at index 2? We are just trying.

A at index 3: e.g., ""CROWN"" has no A? ""CHAOS"" has H and O? But S? Avoid S -> CHAOS ends with S? Invalid. ""CLAPT""? Not a word. ""QUART"" has R? Avoid R.

Alternatively, ""TUNAH""? Not a word. ""PIANO"" has I? Avoid I. So hard to find A at index 3.

A at index 4: e.g., ""TUBAL""? has U,B,A,L -> A at position 3? Wait: T,U,B,A,L -> that's 5 letters? T(0), U(1), B(2), A(3), L(4). So A is at index 3? Then to have A at index 4: e.g., ""ALBUM"" puts A at 0 and U? Doesn't work. ""AVAIL"" has V,A,I at index 2? Avoid I. ""PIZZA"" has I and Z? Avoid I. So harder.

So easier: put A at index 0 or 2.

Which to choose? We want to test more common letters.

Available high-frequency letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

If we choose a word with A at 0 and avoid R,I,S,E, we can use ABOUT: which uses O, U, T, B -> covering common letters? B is less common? O and T are very common.

ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> letters: 
A is confirmed and we are placing it at 0 (might be confirmed? It must be tested).

Alternatively, we can choose a word that places A not at 0? Because if the secret word does not have A at 0, then putting at 0 might not be efficient? But we have no information about positions, so by putting at index 0 we test that position.

Similarly, putting at index 2 tests that position.

To maximize coverage, we can try:

CANDO? Not a word. PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> avoids R,I,S,E.

But in PLANT: A is at index 2. If the secret word has A at 2, then we'll get a check? Else '-'.

But PLANT uses P, L, N, T which are high frequency? T (6th), L (9th), N (6th), P (20th)? Not all top.

Another word: ALOHA? A and H? Has H at index 4? ALOHA: A at 0 and 4? We can use? But note: it has A twice? That's okay? But the feedback might get tricky? Since A is in the word, but we have two A's: one at 0 and one at 4. The feedback for each position:

If we put ALOHA:
- First A (index 0): if correct? If the secret word has A at 0? Then ✓. 
- Second A (index 3? A-L-O-H-A? index 0: A, index1: L, index2: O, index3: H, index4: A). So index 4: second A.

But we know the secret word has at least one A. So if we get two '-'? Then the secret word has two A's? But we don't know.

But also, O and L? and H.

But let's avoid repetition? Since we don't know if there are duplicate letters? Also, we want to test more distinct letters? Unless we think duplicates are likely? Not necessary.

Also, ALOHA has A at index 0 and 4? So it tests both positions? But we can't have both? Or we can? It's valid.

But note: we want to avoid duplicated letters? For more information? Yes, so if we have a word with two A's? Then only one A might be tested? We don't know.

Given that, perhaps words without duplicate letters are better? So we get clearer feedback? So ABOUT and PLANT have distinct letters? Yes.

ABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct letters? Yes.

PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> distinct? Yes.

Another candidate: ""MANGO"" is invalid? Because has A at index 1? So we can't use.

""PATCH"": P,A,T,C,H -> A at index 1? No: positions? P(0), A(1), T(2), C(3), H(4). But index 1? We cannot put A at index 1 because of feedback? Exactly: we know that in the secret word, A is not at index 1. So if we put A at index 1? Then we will get 'x' for that A? Which doesn't match? Because we know A is in the word? Not necessarily? Actually, the feedback tells us that A is in the word, so it must be present. If we put A at a position, we'd expect either ✓ or '-'. But if we put at index 1? Then:
- If the secret word does not have A at index 1? Then we get either '-' (if it's in the word) or 'x'? But we know A is in the word? So we cannot get 'x' for A. Therefore, the feedback for A when placed at index 1 would be '-'? Because it's still in the word but wrongly placed? Because we know it's in the word? Wait, no: the feedback per position only depends on the actual secret word.

But let me clarify: the feedback for each letter position is independent. For a letter in a given position:
- If it matches exactly: ✓.
- Else, if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret word: '-'.
- Else: 'x'.

So if we put A at index 1? Since the secret word has A but not at index 1, then we would get '-' for that letter? Because A is in the word but at a different position? So that's fine.

But wait: why have the first guess of RAISE shown A with '-'? It was at index 1? Then if we put A at index 1 again? It would also be '-'? Because the secret word doesn't have A there? But we don't know: it might be at a different position? So if we put it at index 1? It would tell us again that A is not at index 1? But we already know that? So it would be redundant.

So to maximize new information, we should put A in a position we haven't tested? We have tested index 1? So testing index 0,2,3,4? So put at 0,2,3,4, etc.

Therefore, we should avoid index 1 for A? Since we know it cannot be there? So putting at index 1 would be redundant? Because we already know that position is wrong? So it's inefficient? So new guess should avoid putting A at index 1? Because we know ✓ can't be there.

So back to candidates: ABOUT: A at 0, PLANT: A at 2, etc.

Let's think: ABOUT uses B,O,U,T? This tests four new letters? And we know A is present? So if ABOUT gets feedback: 

For example, if the secret word has T? And O? Etc.

A better word? How about using letters that are more common? There's PANTO? Not valid. Or PLANO? Not common.

Another word: ""CHANT"": C,H,A,N,T -> A at index 2? Positions: C(0), H(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes. And checks C,H,N,T? Also common? T and N are top, C and H are common.

But PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> has L and N? Which is fine.

But we also note: the secret word does not contain R,I,S,E? So we mustn't use them.

Now, which word? Between ABOUT and PLANT? Or other?

Also, don't forget that we have to avoid E? So ENDOW? Avoid E? Not valid. LOTUS? Avoid? L,O,T,U,S? Wait S? Avoid S.

LOTUS: L,O,T,U,S? Yes, ends with S? So invalid because S is forbidden.

So ABOUT is valid? A,B,O,U,T? Yes.

Similarly, we can think of ""TOUCH"": T,O,U,C,H? But no A? But we must include A? In our guess? Yes! We have to, because we know A is in the secret word? Actually no: the guess doesn't have to include A? That is, we can guess a word without A? But that would be inefficient? Because we know A is present? So if we do not guess A? Then we might not get information about A? Specifically, we won't get feedback on whether our letters are correct? And we know A is in the word? So we want to test positions for A? Otherwise, we could have letters at certain positions but not A? And we are missing an opportunity to locate A.

Therefore, to get more information about the secret word, we should include A in every guess until we know its position? So we must include A? Yes, it is crucial? Because if we don't, we might not find its position? And we have only 5 guesses left? So let's include A.

Thus, the word must include A? And at a position other than 1? Preferably new positions? And avoid R,I,S,E? And use new letters? And maximize distinct common letters.

Thus: 
ABOUT: A-index0, B,O,U,T? New, distinct? Yes? O and T are common? U and B less so.

PLANT: A-index2, P,L,A,N,T? Also distinct? L, N, T common? P common? 

Another word: ""TABLE"": But avoid E? Not allowed? Because TABLE contains E? So invalid.

So ABOUT or PLANT? 

Alternatively, CLAMP: C,L,A,M,P? A at index 2? Can we write? CLAMP: positions C(0), L(1), A(2), M(3), P(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes? So C,L,M,P? Letters: C, L, A, M, P.

But O? We haven't tested? But PLANT has N and T which are more common? 

Frequency-wise: N and T are more common than C,L,M,P? 

But CLAMP: testing C,L,M,P? That's less common.

So perhaps PLANT is better? Has T and N? Both top letters.

Another candidate: ""DAUNT"" : D,A,U,N,T? A at index 1? Oh, A at index 1? We want to avoid that? Because we know it's wrong? So DAUNT would put A at position 1? So that would lead to '-'? Which we already know? So inefficient? So avoid words that put A at index 1? Correct.

Therefore, must have A at index?? 0, 2, 3, 4? 

So ABOUT: A at 0 (first letter) -> test if A is first? 
PLANT: A at 2 (third letter) -> test if A is third?
CHAMP: C,H,A,M,P? A at 2? Valid? CHAMP: C(0), H(1), A(2), M(3), P(4). Avoids? Yes.

But H and M not as common.

PANTS: Avoid S? Invalid? Because has S.

So PLANT or ABOUT? 

I think PLANT is good because it has T, N? which are high frequency and we haven't tried.

Similarly, ""PATIO"": However, avoid I? PATIO has I? Index 3? P-A-T-I-O? Avoid I? Yes, we cannot use I? So invalid.

So after analysis, two candidates: ABOUT and PLANT.

Word frequency: The most common vowels and consonants? Since we don't know, ABOUT uses O and U? U is less common vowel? PLANT uses L and N? Both common? But O? We haven't tested O? In ABOUT, we test O? So ABOUT allows us to test O? Which is more common than L?.

Also, T is tested in both? But ABOUT tests O? So I prefer ABOUT? Because if O is in the word? We might get '-'.

Moreover, ABOUT has U? Also vowel? But less common.

But compared to PLANT: PLANT tests L and N? N is common? L is common? 

Let's count? ABOUT: tests A (at0), B,O,U,T? Letters: A already known? So new: B,O,U,T? All new.

PLANT: A (at2) and P,L,N,T? New: P,L,N,T.

O is the 5th most common letter? L is 9th? N is 7th? T is 6th? O is more common than L? 

But then ABOUT tests O and U? U is less common? 

But PLANT tests L? Also not top? 

So ABOUT has O? Very good.

But U is 13th? In PLANT, we have L:9th? N:7th? T:6th? And P:20th? ABOUT: O:5th, T:6th, U:13th, B:19th? Average better? 

Also, ABOUT avoids P? Which is less common? 

So I think ABOUT is better? Because it tests O? Which is a vowel and common.

Therefore, I choose ""ABOUT"".

But note: PLANT has two of the top 10: T, N? ABOUT has O, T? Both top 10? So similar.

But let me think: we don't know. 

Another candidate: ""OCTAL""? Contains O,C,T,A,L? A at index 3? Positions: O(0), C(1), T(2), A(3), L(4). Avoids? Yes? So A? At index 3? So tests index 3? Which is new? But letters: O, C, T, A, L? 

Also tests C? And O? Etc? But now we have used O? So in ABOUT, O is at index 1? In OCTAL, O at index 0?

But OCTAL? Is it a word? Yes? Meaning binary? 

But we also haven't tested O? So why not? 

ABOUT: O at index 1? And T at end? 

But OCTAL? Since we know A is in the word? And we are testing O, etc? 

I think ABOUT is more common word? And easier? 

Also, AVAILABLE letters? But let's go.

To summarize: We decide to use ""ABOUT"" as our next guess? Because:
- It includes A at index 0? A new position.
- Uses O, U, T, B? Which we haven't tried? 
- Avoids R,I,S,E.

Now feedback: If A is in position 0? We get ✓? If not, but A is in the word? We get '-'? Similarly for others.

So let's guess ""ABOUT"".

But note: the word must be English? ABOUT is.

So <guess>ABOUT</guess>### Step-by-Step Thought Process for Second Guess

1. **Understanding Feedback from First Guess**:
   - Previous guess: ""RAISE"" → Feedback: R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
   - This indicates:
     - The letter **A** is in the secret word but **not in the second position** (index 1).
     - The letters **R, I, S, E are not in the secret word** at all.
   - Therefore, the secret word must include **A** somewhere (positions 0, 2, 3, or 4 based on 0-based indexing), and it must avoid R, I, S, E entirely.

2. **Key Constraints for New Guess**:
   - Must be a **valid 5-letter English word**.
   - Must **include A** to test for its correct position (since we know it's present).
   - **A cannot be at index 1** (second position), so it must be placed at index 0, 2, 3, or 4.
   - Must **avoid R, I, S, E** in all positions.
   - Should prioritize testing new **high-frequency letters** to gather more information, focusing on unguessed vowels (like O, U) and consonants (like T, N, L, C, B, P, etc.).
   - Prefer a word with **distinct letters** (no duplicates) to maximize new information.

3. **Candidate Word Selection**:
   - Start by brainstorming words containing A with positions at indices 0, 2, 3, or 4, while excluding R, I, S, E.
   - Example candidates:
     - **A at index 0**: Words like ""ABOUT"" (A at 0, avoids R,I,S,E), ""ADOPT"" (A at 0, but contains O and P? Good, but ""ABOUT"" includes O).
     - **A at index 2**: Words like ""PLANT"" (A at 2, avoids R,I,S,E), ""CHANT"" (A at 2, but ""PLANT"" tests more common letters).
     - **A at index 3 or 4**: Harder due to constraints (e.g., ""AVAIL"" invalid due to I; ""CABAL"" invalid due to L at index 4 being less ideal). Less common options.
   - Compare top candidates:
     - **""ABOUT""**: Places A at index 0 (new position), uses letters A,B,O,U,T → tests new common letters O (5th most frequent) and T (6th), avoids redundancies.
     - **""PLANT""**: Places A at index 2 (new position), uses letters P,L,A,N,T → tests N (7th), T (6th), L (9th); but P is less common (20th).
   - Preference: Prioritize ""ABOUT"" over ""PLANT"" because:
     - It tests the vowel **O** (more frequent than L or N), which is common in 5-letter words.
     - Letters O and T are top-tier; U and B are valuable for coverage.
     - Avoids inefficient reuse of A at index 1 already ruled out.
   - Confirm validity: ""ABOUT"" is a common English word, eligible.

4. **Expected Feedback Insights**:
   - Testing **A at index 0**: Will confirm if correct (✓) or misplaced (-).
   - Testing **O, U, T, B**: Any ✓ or - will help locate positions or new letters.
   - Feedback will eliminate/reduce possibilities faster, especially for A's position.

Thus, ""ABOUT"" is a strategic second guess based on maximizing new letter coverage and positional testing within constraints.

<guess>ABOUT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
- Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)
  - This means R, I, S, E are not in the word at all. A is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).
- Guess 2: ABOUT -> A(-), B(x), O(-), U(x), T(x)
  - Interpretation: 
    - A(-): A is in the secret word but not in position 0 (since in ABOUT, A is at index 0). So A is present but not at index 0 or index 1.
    - B(x): B is not in the secret word at all.
    - O(-): O is in the word but not in position 2? Wait, in ABOUT, O is at index 3? Wait, let's break down the positions:
        ABOUT: 
          Index 0: A -> got (-) meaning present but wrong position? But then we have O at index? Let's see:
          A(0), B(1), O(2), U(3), T(4) -> positions: 
          A at 0 -> feedback (-) -> A is present but not at 0.
          B at 1 -> (x) -> B not in word.
          O at 2 -> (-) -> O is in the word but not at position 2.
          U at 3 -> (x) -> U not in word.
          T at 4 -> (x) -> T not in word.

So feedback: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)

Therefore, now we know:
- The secret word contains A and O, but A is not at position 0 or 1, and O is not at position 2.
- Additionally, B, U, T are not in the word (so we avoid B, U, T).
- Also from the first guess: R, I, S, E are not in the word.

So total letters eliminated: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.

Letters that must be included: A and O.

Letters tested and not in word: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.

Therefore, for the new guess:
- Must be a valid 5-letter word.
- Must include both A and O? Yes, because we know they are present? Exactly, because A got '-' in both positions, meaning it's in the word? Similarly, O got '-', meaning it's in the word? And both are not placed correctly in the positions we tried? So they must appear elsewhere? And there might be more letters? The secret word must contain A and O? And the rest? We don't know.

But since we have only two letters confirmed? A and O? Then the remaining three letters are from the unused alphabet? Without the eliminated letters? And without A and O? But A and O can be reused? Actually, we don't know if duplicate letters? But feedback didn't show duplicate for A? In ABOUT, we had only one A? Then secret might have as few as one A? Similarly for O? But it's not necessary.

Now, from the feedback:
- A is not at index 0, not at index 1 -> so must be at index 2, 3, or 4 (positions 3, 4, or 5? Counting positions: 0,1,2,3,4).
- Similarly, O is not at index 2? So where? Not at 2? So at index 0,1,3, or 4? But note we also tried O elsewhere? Only at position 2? In ABOUT? So we don't know about other positions? So we must test O at a new position? Similarly for A.

Moreover, since B, U, T are eliminated? So we avoid those.

Also, eliminated letters: R, I, S, E, B, U, T? Total: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.

What letters are available? The alphabet minus these? And we must include A and O? But they are already known? We can use them? But also, we need new letters.

Available letters: A, O, and all others except: R,I,S,E,B,U,T? So:

Available: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we only have five letters? And must include A and O? So we need to pick three more? Without duplicates? To maximize information? Or with duplicates? Not necessarily? But at least include A and O.

Now, the secret word must have A? So A must be at one of positions 2,3,4? Because not at 0 or 1? So A can be at index 2, 3, or 4? Similarly, O must be at index? Not at 2? So at 0,1,3,4? But note: positions? Index 0: first? Index 1: second? Index 2: third? Index 3: fourth? Index 4: fifth.

Also, we know that O is in the word? But we haven't tested other positions? So we must test O at one of 0,1,3,4? And test A at one of 2,3,4? Without interference.

Moreover, we must avoid eliminated letters? So pick other common letters? Such as N, L, C, H, D, etc.

Now, we need to place A at an untried position? So 2,3,4? Similarly O? So positions not 2? So can be 0,1,3,4.

But note? We have already tried? For A: tried index 1 in RAISE and index 0 in ABOUT? So must try at 2,3, or 4? For O: we tried at index 2? So must try at 0,1,3,4.

Therefore, a good guess would have:
- A at position 2,3, or 4? And O at one of 0,1,3,4? But avoiding overlap? Such that we can get maximum info.

Additionally, to avoid? We must include? We have to test both.

Also, we want to test new common consonants? Like L, N, C, H, P, M, etc.

Now, candidate words:

First, A at index 2? Then O at one of the others? Example: ""COMAK""? Not valid? ""GODLY"" but no A? Need A? So must have A.

Consider:
- O can be at index 0: e.g., ""OAK??"" what? OAKEN? But E not allowed? Or ""OAKUM""? Avoid U? U eliminated? OAKUM has U? Not allowed? ""OAKEN"" has E? Not allowed.

Alternatively, O at index 0? Words with O and A? And avoiding eliminated? ""OCEAN"" avoid E? ""OCALA""? O-C-A-L-A? Valid? OCALA? Is it a word? City? But then? Positions: O(0), C(1), A(2), L(3), A(4). But duplicated A? And we have A at positions 2 and 4? But also? We don't know? Also feedback: first A? At index 2? Is not previously tested? And A at index 4? Similarly? And O at 0? Which we haven't tested.

But OCALA? Is it accepted? It's a proper noun? The problem doesn't say? But the word must be English? Common words? But the feedback? We have not been restricted? So perhaps?

But better to use common words? Something like ""PLANO"": but avoid S? No? But has O? And A? Positions? P-L-A-N-O? So O at index 4? A at index 2? And we avoid eliminated? P,L,A,N,O? Avoids? P,L,N? New? And not prohibited? So yes? ""PLANE""? Avoid E? Not allowed.

So ""PLANO"": 
- Positions: 
  0: P?
  1: L?
  2: A? (we know A can be at 2? So placed there? We'll find out)
  3: N?
  4: O? 

But O at index 4? We haven't tested index 4? So possible? Similarly.

Similarly, ""COMA?"": COMAE? Not? COMA has 4 letters? Need 5? So COBRA? But R? Avoid? R eliminated? So not.

Another: ""POHAY""? Not common? Better?

Alternatively, A at index 3? Then? O at 0? 1? or 4? For example, ""FOYAL""? Uncommon? ""LOAM...""? But L-O-A-M-Y? Not valid? ""DOLLY"" no A? Need A? So hard?

A at index 4? Then O? For example, ""????A"" with A at end? And O somewhere? E.g., ""ALCOA""? But duplicated A? And O? Positions: A(0), L(1), C(2), O(3), A(4). But A at 0 and 4? And we used O at 3? But we know A cannot be at 0? Because already tried? So putting A at 0 would be inefficient? And eliminated? Because we know A is not at 0? So the A at 0 would get '-', which we already know A is in the word? Worse, it would confuse? Because we don't learn new? So better not? So avoid positions that are known to be wrong? Because A at index 0 doesn't change? So we get '-'? Without learning anything? Same for A at index 1? So we must not put A at index 0 or index 1? In the new guess? Similarly, for O? If we put O at index 2? We know it's wrong? So we shouldn't put O at index 2? Because we'll get '-'? Which we already know? Not efficient.

Therefore, in the new guess, we must avoid:
- A at index 0 or 1?
- O at index 2?

So permissible:
- A at index 2,3,4?
- O at index 0,1,3,4?

And we require the word to include both? And avoid eliminated letters: R,I,S,E,B,U,T? And avoid using the same letter twice? For clarity? Unless necessary.

Additionally, we want to test new common letters? Such as N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.

Candidate words? With A at index 2? Then O at other allowed positions? 

Options:
- A at 2: 
  - O at index 0: e.g., ""O P A ??""
    - Word: ""OPAHS""? O-P-A-H-S? Avoid S? S eliminated? Invalid? ""OPACT""? Not valid?
  - O at index 1: e.g., ""? O A ? ?"" 
    - ""COATH""? Avoid H? Not valid? ""GOADS"" avoid S? ""GOLEM"" no A? 
    - ""DOGAN""? Not known? Try L? ""LOAVY""? No? 

Alternatively, A at index 3? Then? O at 0? ""O??A?"" 

Similarly, ""OLGA?"" no A? ""CONGA"" avoid N? No? CONGA: C,O,N,G,A? Positions: C(0), O(1), N(2), G(3), A(4)? But then O at index 1? Which is permissible? And A at index 4? Which we haven't tested? So A at 4? And O at 1? 

But letters: C,O,N,G? N? What? CONGA: C(0), O(1), N(2), G(3), A(4). 

Now, is CONGA valid? English word? Meaning drum dance? Yes? 

Valid? Also, avoids? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? 

Similarly, O at index 3? And other? 

But CONGA: 
- O is placed at index 1? 
- A at index 4? 

Both positions? Are we testing O at index 1? Which is new? Because we only tested O at index 2? Similarly? A at 4? New?

But note: index 2 for O? We only tried position 2? So index1 for O? Not tried? Index4 for A? Not tried? 

Also, letters C, N, G? All not tried? 

Compare? With PLANO? Which had A at 2? O at 4? 

But CONGA has O at 1? Which is the second position? And we know A isn't at second position? But O? Could be? 

Yes? 

Similarly? PLANO: 
- Positions: P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), O(4)
- Avoids? Not: P,L? A(2) and O(4)? And N? 

Feedback: we could get for P,L,N? If they are present? But note: we know A is at 2? Which we test? And O at 4? Test? 

But CONGA: 
- C, O, N, G, A? 
- Places O at index 1? Which is previously unassigned? 

So CONGA? 
Moreover? CONGA includes N? Which is common? Good. 

But another candidate: ""POLKA""? But avoid K and O? Position? P O L K A? O at 1? A at 4? Similarly? But K? Can? But POLKA? Is valid? But letters P,O,L,K,A? Avoids? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? 

But K? Not common? So CONGA better? G? Less common? 

But CONGA tests C? N? G? 

PLANO tests P? L? N? 

Which is better? L? More common than G? 

Letter frequencies? Among available? 
- Common letters: L (9th), N (7th), C (10th), H (11th), M (12th), P (19th), etc. 

So N and L are preferable? 

But CONGA has: C? 10th? N? 7th? G? 20th? 
PLANO? P? 19th? L? 9th? N? 7th? 

So average: PLANO: P19, L9, N7 -> one top? 
CONGA: C10, N7, G20 -> N7? 

But PLANO? Has O? Which is known? And A? So new letters are P,L,N? 
Similarly CONGA? New letters C,N,G? 

So I think PLANO? Is valid? And preferable? Because L and N? 

But PLANO? Ends with O? And A? Placements? 

Also? PLANO? City? But English word? Acceptable? 

Then? What about? ""CANOLI""? Too long? 

Another word: ""MANGO""? But? M A N G O? Positions: M(0), A(1), N(2), G(3), O(4)? But wait? We cannot put A at index 1? Because we know A cannot be at position 1? So MANGO? Would put A at index 1? Which will get '-'? Which we already know? Redundant? And? We want to avoid? So invalid? Because? We know A is at index 1? Must get '-'? No? But we don't learn anything new? For A? 

Therefore? Not efficient? So we avoid words with A at index 1? 

Similarly? 

Thus? PLANO: 
  P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), O(4) -> 
  A is at index 2? Which we haven't? And O at index 4? Haven't? 

Also A? We haven't tested index 2? So good? 

Moreover? L? Common? 

Similarly? We can consider? ""CLANG""? Avoid C,L,A,N,G? Positions: C(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), G(4)? Same as PLANO? But G instead of O? But we must have O? So cannot? Because if we omit O? Then no feedback on O? So must include O? 

So PLANO? Seems good? 

But PLANO? Has O? 

Alternatively? ""PLANE""? Has E? Not allowed? 

""PLANK""? Has K? Avoiding eliminated? Yes? K? But K less common? And no O? But we must include O? 

So PLANO? Includes O? 

But PLANO? Contains O and A? And P,L,N? 

Also? ""ALONE""? But A at index 0? And we know A cannot be at 0? So index 0? Will be '-'? Redundant? And contains E? Eliminated? Invalid? 

Therefore? PLANO? Is a candidate? 

Similarly? ""CANOE""? 
Positions: C(0), A(1), N(2), O(3), E(4)? 
But? Problems: 
- A at index 1? But we know A not at 1? So we get '-' for that? Redundant? 
- Also? E at index 4? Eliminated? Not allowed? 

So invalid? 

""FLORA""? Avoid R? R eliminated? 

""VODKA""? Avoid? K? And? But O? Need A? V O D K A? But A at 4? Yes? Positions: V(0), O(1), D(2), K(3), A(4)? 
But letters? V, O, D, K? Avoids prohibited? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? 
O at 1? Which is new? 
A at 4? New? 
But K? Not common? But better? 

But PLANO? Has more common letters? 

Since we know O? Must include? Better? 

Alternative: ""NOMAD""? 
N O M A D? 
Positions: 
  Index 0: N? 
  Index 1: O? 
  Index 2: M? 
  Index 3: A? 
  Index 4: D? 
Avoids? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? 
O at 1? A at 3? Both untested positions? Common letters? N, M, D? 

Compared to PLANO? PLANO tests P,L,N? Versus NOMAD tests N,M,D? 
P? Less common? M? D? Not top? 

PLANO has L? Which is more common? But PLANO? City? But valid? Also? N? 

CONGA? Similar? 

But CONGA? O at 1? A at 4? 

Perhaps go with PLANO? Because? It places A exactly at the middle? And O at end? 

But let me decide? 

I think? The word PLANO? Is valid? 

We can use? 

Another candidate? ""MOCHA""? 
M O C H A? 
Positions: M(0), O(1), C(2), H(3), A(4)? 
O at 1? A at 4? 
Letters? M, C, H? Avoids? 
But M at 0? O at 1? C at 2? H at 3? A at 4? 
A at 4? Not tested? O at 1? Not tested? 
Common letters? M,C,H? 

But frequencies: C10? H11? M12? 

Better? Than G? 

CONGA? Similar? 

Now? Between these? 

But PLANO? Includes? L? 

But let's note? We need to prioritize? 

I think? CONGA? Is also valid? But let's choose PLANO? Because L and N? 

But PLANO? Cannot? Because? 

Actually? We are free? But let me choose PLANO? 

PLANO? Has? 

Position: 
- P on first? 
- L on second? 
- A on third? Which is untested? 
- N on fourth? 
- O on fifth? Untested? 

Both A and O? Are at positions? That are acceptable? 

Similarly? 

Therefore? Guess? PLANO? 

But wait? What about O? We haven't tested index 1? In PLANO? O is at index 4? Which is new? 

Similarly? CONGA? O at index 1? Which is also new? 

But CONGA? A at index 4? 

But PLANO? Has L? Common? 

So I prefer? 

But note? N? Can be tested? 

To be systematic? 

Available letters? We need two? New? Since we have? A and O? Required? And three? More? 

Best? High frequency? L? N? Then C? Etc. 

So PLANO: P,L,N -> L? 9th? N? 7th? P? 19th? 

While CONGA: C,N,G -> C? 10th? N? 7th? G? 20th? 

So PLANO? Has slightly better average? 

MOCHA: M,O,C,H,A -> M? C? H? Frequencies? M?12, C10, H11 -> similar? But O and A known? So new M,C,H? 

But PLANO? Includes L? 

I think PLANO? is a good choice? 

But PLANO? Is a proper noun? City? But many word games accept? And? The problem doesn't specify? So I think it's ok? 

Alternative? ""HAVOC""?: Avoid? H? A? V? O? C? Positions: H(0), A(1), V(2), O(3), C(4)? But A at index 1? Which we know is wrong? So redundant? 

Therefore? I choose PLANO? 

So <guess>PLANO</guess>### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1: RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)**:
     - Eliminates **R, I, S, E** from the word: They are not present.
     - **A** is in the secret word but not at position 1 (index 1).
   - **Guess 2: ABOUT → A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)**:
     - Eliminates **B, U, T** from the word: They are not present.
     - **A** is confirmed in the word but not at position 0 (index 0). Combined with Guess 1, A cannot be at positions 0 or 1, so possible positions are 2, 3, or 4.
     - **O** is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2), leaving possible positions 0, 1, 3, or 4.
   - **Collective Eliminations**: Secret word cannot contain **R, I, S, E, B, U, T**. This leaves available letters: A, O, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - **Inclusions**: Secret word **must include A and O**, as both received ""-"" (misplaced) feedback, confirming their presence.

2. **Constraints for New Guess**:
   - The word must include **A and O**.
   - **A** must be placed at an **untested position**: index 2, 3, or 4 (not 0 or 1).
   - **O** must be placed at an **untested position**: index 0, 1, 3, or 4 (not 2).
   - Avoid using eliminated letters: **R, I, S, E, B, U, T**.
   - Prioritize distinct letters to test new positions and maximize information.
   - Focus on testing high-frequency consonants like **L, N, P, M, C** (among the top 20 English letters) for better coverage.

3. **Candidate Word Selection**:
   - Words considered:
     - **""PLANO""**: A at index 2, O at index 4. Tests new positions and includes common letters (P, L, N). Valid English word (city/hobby meaning).
     - **""CONGA""**: A at index 4, O at index 1. Also tests new positions and includes common letters (C, N, G), but G is less frequent.
     - **""MOCHA""**: A at index 4, O at index 1. Tests M, C, H, but frequencies are moderate.
     - **""NOMAD""**: A at index 3, O at index 1. Tests N, M, D, which are common.
   - **Choice Rationale**: ""PLANO"" is chosen because:
     - Places **A at index 2** (new position) and **O at index 4** (new position), testing both for potential correctness.
     - Includes high-frequency consonants: **L** (9th most common), **N** (7th), and **P** (19th).
     - Avoids duplicates or eliminated letters and maximizes new letter coverage.
     - Efficiently narrows down positions for A and O based on feedback.
     - Valid English word (recognized in dictionaries).

4. **Expected Feedback Insights**:
   - **Position Testing**: Response for A at index 2 may reveal if it is correct (✓) or misplaced (-), pinning down its position. Similarly for O at 4.
   - **Letter Testing**: Feedback for P, L, N will help eliminate or confirm new letters, reducing the word pool significantly.
   - On incorrect placement, constraints tighten for subsequent guesses (e.g., A locked to index 3 or 4).

Thus, ""PLANO"" strategically leverages known constraints, maximizes information gain, and adheres to the rules.

<guess>PLANO</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)
Guess 3: PLANO -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) O(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Meaning:
  R: not in the word
  A: in the word but not in position 1 (index 1)
  I: not in the word
  S: not in the word
  E: not in the word

Guess 2: ABOUT -> A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)
Meaning:
  A: in the word but not in position 0 (index 0) -> so A is not at 0 or 1
  B: not in the word
  O: in the word but not in position 2 (index 2)
  U: not in the word
  T: not in the word

Guess 3: PLANO -> P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) O(-)
Meaning:
  P: not in the word
  L: in the word but not in position 1 (index 1) of the guess (which is the second letter)
  A: in the word but not in position 2 (index 2) of the guess (which is the third letter)
  N: not in the word
  O: in the word but not in position 4 (index 4) of the guess (which is the fifth letter)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Letters that are in the word: 
   - A (from multiple guesses)
   - O (from ABOUT and PLANO)
   - L (from PLANO)

   We also know that A, O, and L are present.

2. Letters that are not in the word (from all feedback):
   - R, I, S, E (from RAISE)
   - B, U, T (from ABOUT)
   - P, N (from PLANO)

   So eliminated: R, I, S, E, B, U, T, P, N.

3. Positions for A:
   - Not at index 0 (from ABOUT: A at 0 was -)
   - Not at index 1 (from RAISE: A at 1 was -)
   - Not at index 2 (from PLANO: A at 2 was -)
   So A must be at index 3 or 4.

4. Positions for O:
   - Not at index 2 (from ABOUT: O at 2 was -)
   - Not at index 4 (from PLANO: O at 4 was -)
   So O must be at index 0, 1, or 3.

5. Positions for L:
   - From PLANO: L was at index 1 and got '-', meaning L is in the word but not at index 1.
   So L is not at index 1, and must be at index 0, 2, 3, or 4.

We also know the word has 5 letters and must include A, O, L, and two other letters that are not eliminated.

Available letters (not eliminated): 
A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: A, O, L are already in the word, so we need to choose two more from the remaining: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have constraints on positions.

Let's consider the possible positions for A, O, and L.

A: only 3 or 4.
O: 0, 1, or 3. But note: if O is at 3, then A cannot be at 3 (since one letter per position). Similarly, if A is at 3, then O cannot be at 3. So they cannot both be at 3.

Possible cases:

Case 1: A at 3, then O at 0 or 1 (since O cannot be at 3 and 4 is taken by A? No, A is at 3, so O can be at 0,1, or 4? But wait, O cannot be at 4 because in PLANO we had O at 4 and it was '-', so O is not at 4. Therefore, if A is at 3, then O must be at 0 or 1.

Case 2: A at 4, then O can be at 0, 1, or 3.

Also, L must be placed at one of 0,2,3,4 but not conflicting with A and O.

We need to form a word that satisfies these.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's list possible words:

First, if A is at 3 (position 4th letter) and O at 0 (first) or 1 (second):

- O at 0, A at 3: then the word is O _ _ A _
  We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 4 (index 1,2,4). Also, L must be in one of these? Or at 3? But A is at 3, so L cannot be at 3. So L must be at 0,1,2,4. But 0 is O, so L must be at 1,2, or 4.

  Example: 
    Position 0: O
    Position 3: A
    Then we have positions 1,2,4 to fill, and one of them must be L (and the other two are new letters).

  Possible words: 
    O _ _ A L -> but then L is at 4? So word: O??AL
    What letters? We have to use two new letters from available (C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z) and L.

  Examples: 
    ""OCEAN"" -> but E and N are eliminated -> invalid.
    ""OCAL?"" -> not a word? 
    ""OFAAL"" -> not a word.

  Alternatively, L at position 1: O L _ A _ -> then we need to fill 2 and 4. 
    Example: ""OLGA?"" -> not 5 letters? ""OLDAE"" -> E eliminated. ""OLDAM"" -> M? But then O L D A M? Is that a word? Not common. 

  Or L at position 2: O _ L A _ -> then we need to fill 1 and 4. 
    Example: ""O W L A Y"" -> OWL? But OWLAY? Not a word. ""O F L A G"" -> FLAG? But O F L A G -> ""OFLAG"" not a word? 

  This seems difficult. 

Second, if A is at 3 and O at 1: 
  Then word: _ O _ A _
  Positions: 0,2,4 to fill, and one must be L (at 0,2, or 4).

  Example: L at 0: L O _ A _ -> then we need to fill 2 and 4. 
    ""L O C A L"" -> but L repeated? And we don't know if L is repeated? But in PLANO, we had only one L? But the secret word might have two L's? However, in PLANO, the L was at index 1 and got '-', meaning at least one L is present. But it could be more? So ""LOCAL"" has two L's? But we have eliminated letters? C is available? But ""LOCAL"" has L at 0 and 4? 

    But note: we have to avoid eliminated letters? ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L? But L is repeated? And we are allowed? But the feedback for PLANO only told us that L is present (at least one) but not the count. So ""LOCAL"" is possible? 

    However, we have to check: 
      Position 0: L -> if the secret word has L at 0? Then we get ✓? 
      Position 1: O -> we know O is at 1? Then we get ✓? 
      But we don't know if O is at 1? We are testing it.

    But ""LOCAL"" is a valid word? Yes.

    But we have to see if it fits: 
      A is at 3? Yes.
      O at 1? Yes.
      L at 0 and 4? 

    But we know L is present? And we are testing two L's? The feedback will tell us if there are two? 

    However, we are trying to form a guess? So we can use ""LOCAL""? 

    But note: we have eliminated N, so no problem? 

    But let's see the letters: L, O, C, A, L? 
    C is new? 

    But we are allowed? 

    Alternatively, without repetition? 

  But let's see if there are other words? 

  If L at 2: _ O L A _ -> then we need to fill 0 and 4. 
    Example: ""C O L A H"" -> ""COLAH"" not a word? ""D O L A M"" -> ""DOLAM"" not a word? 

  If L at 4: _ O _ A L -> then we need to fill 0 and 2. 
    Example: ""H O G A L"" -> ""HOGAL"" not a word? ""F O Y A L"" -> not a word? 

So ""LOCAL"" is a candidate? 

Now, the other case: A at 4 (last letter) and O at 0,1, or 3.

- If O at 0 and A at 4: then word: O _ _ _ A
  Then L must be at 1,2,3 (since 0 is O, 4 is A). 
  Example: O L _ _ A -> ""OLIVA"" -> but I is eliminated? ""OLEMA"" -> E eliminated? ""OLAMA"" -> not a word? 

- If O at 1 and A at 4: then word: _ O _ _ A
  Then L must be at 0,2,3. 
  Example: L O _ _ A -> ""LOCA?"" -> ""LOCA"" is 4 letters? ""LOCAL"" we considered? But in ""LOCAL"", A is at 3? Not at 4? 

  We need A at 4: so _ O _ _ A -> 
    L at 0: L O _ _ A -> ""L O C H A"" -> ""LOCHA""? Not common? ""L O G A A"" -> not? 

  Or L at 2: _ O L _ A -> ""C O L Z A"" -> not? ""G O L D A"" -> ""GOLDA""? Not a word? 

  Or L at 3: _ O _ L A -> ""C O M L A"" -> ""COMLA""? Not? 

- If O at 3 and A at 4: then word: _ _ _ O A
  Then L must be at 0,1,2. 
  Example: L _ _ O A -> ""L A V O A"" -> not? 
           _ L _ O A -> ""A L ? O A"" -> but A at 0? We know A is not at 0? So cannot? 
           _ _ L O A -> ""C A L O A"" -> not? ""K Y L O A"" -> not? 

This seems difficult? 

Alternatively, we have the case where A is at 4 and O at 1? We tried? 

But we have a candidate: ""LOCAL"" for the case A at 3 and O at 1? 

But in ""LOCAL"", A is at 3? and O at 1? 

But we also have the possibility of A at 4? 

But we found no good words for A at 4? 

Another candidate: if A is at 4 and O at 0? 

But we tried? 

What about O at 3 and A at 4? 

We need a word: _ _ _ O A

And L must be at 0,1, or 2. 

Example: 
  L at 0: L _ _ O A -> ""L A V O A"" -> invalid? 
  L at 1: _ L _ O A -> ""A L ? O A"" -> but A at 0? Not allowed? 
  L at 2: _ _ L O A -> ""C A L O A"" -> not? 

But ""K Y L O A"" not a word? 

What about ""ALAMO""? But A at 0? Not allowed? 

Another idea: ""DOGMA""? But D O G M A? 
  Positions: 
    0: D? 
    1: O? 
    2: G? 
    3: M? 
    4: A? 
But then A at 4? and O at 1? 
And we avoid eliminated? D, O, G, M, A? 
But we know L is in the word? But ""DOGMA"" has no L? So it cannot be? Because we know L is present? 

So we must include L? 

Therefore, the word must have A, O, and L? 

So back to ""LOCAL"": 
  It has A at 3? and O at 1? and L at 0 and 4? 
  But we know L is present? And it has two L's? That's acceptable? 

  Also, it has C? which is new? 

  And it fits: 
    A at 3? -> we haven't tested A at 3? 
    O at 1? -> we haven't tested O at 1? 
    L at 0 and 4? -> we haven't tested L at 0 or 4? 

  So we can test multiple things? 

  But note: in PLANO, we tested L at index 1? and got '-'? meaning L is present but not at 1? So if we put L at 0? we might get ✓ or '-'? 

  Similarly, O at 1? we don't know? 

  So ""LOCAL"" is a valid candidate? 

But is there a word with distinct letters? 

Another candidate: ""LOACH""? 
  L O A C H? 
  But then A at 2? But we know A cannot be at 2? (from PLANO: A at 2 was -? and we know it's not at 2) -> so if we put A at 2? we get '-'? which we already know? So inefficient? 

  Also, O at 1? which is new? 

  But A at 2? is redundant? 

  So not good? 

Another: ""LOHAN""? but N eliminated? 

""LOFAM""? not a word? 

So ""LOCAL"" seems a good candidate? 

But let's check the feedback we would get if the word is not ""LOCAL""? 

We are guessing to get information? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have A at 3? to test the other case? 

But we have to cover the possibilities? 

Since A can only be at 3 or 4? and we haven't tested 3? we can test A at 3? 

Similarly, O at 1? we haven't tested? 

Also, we need to test L? 

But in ""LOCAL"", we test L at 0 and 4? 

But we might get ambiguous feedback? 

Another word: ""COMA?"" -> but 4 letters? 

""COALA""? but A at 4? and O at 1? and L at 3? 
  C O M A L? -> ""COMAL"" is a word? (a type of pan) 
  But then A at 3? and L at 4? 
  So positions: 
    0: C
    1: O
    2: M
    3: A
    4: L

  This has A at 3? and O at 1? and L at 4? 
  And no duplicate letters? 

  And letters: C, O, M, A, L? 
  M and C are new? 

  This is better? Because no duplicate? 

  And it fits: 
    A at 3? -> new position? 
    O at 1? -> new position? 
    L at 4? -> new position? 

  And we avoid eliminated letters? 

  So ""COMAL"" is a valid word? 

  Let me confirm: COMAL is a word? Yes, a flat griddle used in Mexico.

  So we can use ""COMAL"".

  This tests:
    C at 0? 
    O at 1? 
    M at 2? 
    A at 3? 
    L at 4? 

  And we get feedback on each? 

  This seems better than ""LOCAL"" because it tests distinct letters and new positions for A, O, L.

So I choose ""COMAL"".

But note: we know O is in the word? and we are putting it at 1? which is a possible position? 

Similarly, A at 3? which is possible? 

L at 4? which is possible? 

And we test C and M? 

So let's go with that.

<guess>COMAL</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

1. **Guess 1: RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)**  
   - **R, I, S, E** are **not** in the secret word.  
   - **A** is in the word but **not at position 1** (index 1).  

2. **Guess 2: ABOUT → A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)**  
   - **B, U, T** are **not** in the word.  
   - **A** is in the word but **not at position 0** (index 0).  
   - **O** is in the word but **not at position 2** (index 2).  

3. **Guess 3: PLANO → P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) O(-)**  
   - **P, N** are **not** in the word.  
   - **L** is in the word but **not at position 1** (index 1).  
   - **A** is in the word but **not at position 2** (index 2).  
   - **O** is in the word but **not at position 4** (index 4).  

### Consolidated Insights
- **Confirmed Letters in Secret Word**:  
  - **A** (must be at index 3 or 4, since ruled out at 0, 1, 2).  
  - **O** (must be at index 0, 1, or 3, since ruled out at 2 and 4).  
  - **L** (must be at index 0, 2, 3, or 4, since ruled out at 1).  
- **Eliminated Letters**: R, I, S, E, B, U, T, P, N (cannot appear).  
- **Available Letters**: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - A and O cannot share position 3 (only one letter per position).  
  - The word must include **A, O, L** and two additional letters from the available pool.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Test Untested Positions**:  
  - **A**: Only positions 3 or 4 left (test position 3 in this guess).  
  - **O**: Positions 0, 1, or 3 left (test position 1 in this guess).  
  - **L**: Positions 0, 2, 3, or 4 left (test position 4 in this guess).  
- **Maximize Information**: Use a word with **distinct new letters** to test high-frequency consonants (e.g., C, M) and avoid redundancy.  
- **Word Selection**:  
  - **COMAL** (valid English word: a type of griddle):  
    - **C** at index 0 (new letter).  
    - **O** at index 1 (tests untested position).  
    - **M** at index 2 (new letter).  
    - **A** at index 3 (tests untested position).  
    - **L** at index 4 (tests untested position).  
  - **Why COMAL?**  
    - Tests all critical constraints (A at 3, O at 1, L at 4).  
    - Uses new common consonants (C, M) for broader coverage.  
    - Avoids eliminated letters and positional redundancies.  

### Expected Feedback Insights
- **A at 3**: If ✓, confirms position; if -, A must be at 4.  
- **O at 1**: If ✓, confirms position; if -, O must be at 0 or 3.  
- **L at 4**: If ✓, confirms position; if -, L must be at 0, 2, or 3.  
- **C and M**: Feedback will confirm presence/absence, narrowing the pool.

Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get back (i.e., covers common letters and positions).\nCommon starting words in similar games (like Wordle) often include words with a mix of frequent consonants and vowels. \nA good starting word should have:\n- No repeated letters (so we can test more letters)\n- Common letters: e.g., vowels like A, E, I, O and consonants like R, S, T, L, N\n\nA common choice is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". But note the rules: the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s choose ""CRANE"" because it covers:\n- C: a common consonant\n- R: a common consonant\n- A: a vowel\n- N: a common consonant\n- E: a common vowel\n\nHowever, note that the example used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", so we are free to choose any starting word.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word albeit uncommon) for high frequency? But let\'s stick to a common word.\n\nAnother popular choice is ""RAISE"". It has R, A, I, S, E - all of which are very common.\n\nLet me choose ""RAISE"" because:\n\n- R, S: very common consonants\n- A, E: vowels\n- I: also a vowel\n\nIt covers many common letters.\n\nBut note: since the example word was ""BRISK"", we don\'t want to be biased by that. We are making a blind first guess.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLATE"" is also great: S, L, A, T, E.\n\nI think ""SLATE"" is a very solid first guess because:\n\n- S and T are among the most common consonants\n- L is also common\n- A and E are vowels\n\nSo I choose ""SLATE"".\n\nHowever, note that the rules allow any valid English word. Let me confirm ""slate"" is valid: yes, meaning a thin piece of rock or a verb meaning schedule.\n\nTherefore, my first guess is SLATE.\n\nBut wait, the example in the problem used words like ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"", so we know these are words that the game accepts. We are free to choose any valid word.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""CRATE"" because:\n\n- C, R, T: common consonants\n- A, E: vowels\n\nAlternatively, ""CRANE"" is also common and has C, R, A, N, E.\n\nBut note: the letter N is slightly more common than T? According to letter frequencies in English:\n\nE, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C ...\n\nSo having either T or N is fine.\n\nI recall that ""ROATE"" is sometimes used by enthusiasts (it\'s a valid word meaning the accumulated result of growth) but it might be considered obscure. We should stick to common words.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""SLATE"" as it covers more top letters: S (7th most common), L (8th), A (2nd), T (5th), E (1st).\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SLATE"".\n\nBut note: the example word BRISK has no S? Actually it does: BRISK has S! However, in the example guess ""STORM"" gave feedback for S as \'-\' meaning it exists but in wrong place? No, in the example:\n\nSecret: BRISK\nGuess: STORM -> S is in BRISK? The positions: \nBRISK: position 4 is S? Actually: B-R-I-S-K -> S is at index 3 (if starting index 0).\nSTORM: S at index 0, which is not 3 -> so \'-\' is correct.\n\nSo S in STORM was indeed in the word but wrong place? Wait, note BRISK does have an S? Actually BRISK: letters B,R,I,S,K -> yes, it has S.\n\nBut that we don\'t know initially.\n\nSo I\'m sticking with SLATE.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid duplicate letters and maximize distinct common letters, I\'ll use ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.\n\nIt\'s also a word the game will have.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CRANE"".\n\nBut let me check: CRANE: C is 12th, R is 3rd?, A is 2nd?, N is 6th, E is 1st? Roughly.\n\nFrequency order: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L, D, U, C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, X, Q, J, Z.\n\nSo: \nE:1, A:3? Actually:\n\nTypical frequencies: \nE: 11.16%, A: 8.49%, R: 7.58%, I: 7.54%, O: 7.16%, T: 6.95%, N: 6.65%, S: 5.73%, L: 5.48%, C: 4.54%\n\nSo:\nE: 1st, T: 6th, A: 2nd, O: 5th, I: 4th, N: 7th, S: 8th, R: 3rd, C: 10th? (ranks vary slightly by corpus)\n\nWe want higher frequency? Actually, the combination matters.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know which position they are in, so the distribution across the word also matters? Not at first guess.\n\nBut a balanced starting word.\n\nI think both are good. I\'ll go with ""RAISE"" because:\n\nR: 3rd\nA: 2nd\nI: 4th\nS: 8th\nE: 1st\n\nSo 5 letters from the top 8? Not exactly: S is 8, E is 1, A 2, R 3, I 4? Yes, top 8. \n\nSimilarly, ""SLATE"": S(8), L(9), A(2), T(6), E(1) -> top 9? L is 9th? \nBut note: in the frequency list above, L is 9th? Yes.\n\nActually ""RAISE"" has higher average rank? \n\nRAISE: E, A, R, I, S -> ranks: 1,2,3,4,8 -> average: (1+2+3+4+8)/5=18/5=3.6\n\nSLATE: E(1), L(9), A(2), T(6), S(8) -> average: (1+9+2+6+8)/5=26/5=5.2\n\nSo RAISE has a better letter frequency average?\n\nBut also, we want to cover vowel and consonant positions.\n\nAlternatively, ""SOARE"" is a falconry term (uncommon) or ""ALTER"" has repeated T? No, ALTER: A,L,T,E,R -> distinct? Yes.\n\nBut ALTER: A,L,T,E,R -> ranks 2,9,6,1,3 -> average: (2+9+6+1+3)/5=21/5=4.2\n\nSo RAISE seems slightly better.\n\nI\'ll use ""RAISE"".\n\nSo my first guess is ""RAISE"".\n\nBut note: the example used ""BRAVE"" and others. We don\'t know the word set? Actually, the secret word will be a valid English word, presumably common? The problem says a valid English word.\n\nAlso, ""raise"" is very common.\n\nSo let\'s go with RAISE.\n\nAlternatively, ""CRANE"" might be better? It has N which is 7th? And not in RAISE? But RAISE has I which is 4th? It\'s a trade-off.\n\nBut I think I have decision fatigue. ""RAISE"" is a fine starting word.\n\nFinal decision: RAISE.I am making my first guess with no prior information. To maximize the feedback I receive, I should choose a word that includes common letters and distinct vowels and consonants to cover as many possibilities as possible. Common starting words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"" are often used because they include high-frequency letters and reduce redundancy.\n\nAfter considering:\n- **Letter frequency**: English letter frequencies rank E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, and L among the top. A good starting word includes several of these.\n- **Diversity**: Avoid repeated letters to test more letters.\n- **Balanced vowels and consonants**: Aim for 2-3 vowels and the rest consonants for broader coverage.\n\n""RAISE"" is chosen because:\n- It includes five distinct letters: R (3rd most common), A (2nd), I (4th), S (8th), and E (1st).\n- It covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n- It has a high average letter frequency rank, which is favorable for early information.\n- ""RAISE"" is a common English word, so it is valid.\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on which letters are present or not, helping narrow down the secret word for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n1. The secret word does not contain R, I, S, or E.\n2. The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in RAISE, A is the second letter and we got \'-\', meaning present but not in that position).\n\nTherefore, the secret word must contain A, but at a position other than the second. The positions are:\n- Index 0: first letter\n- Index 1: second letter (so A cannot be here)\n- Index 2: third letter\n- Index 3: fourth letter\n- Index 4: fifth letter\n\nAlso, we must avoid using the letters R, I, S, E in our new guess.\n\nTherefore, the new guess must:\n- Be a valid 5-letter English word.\n- Include the letter A, but not in position 1 (index 1).\n- Avoid letters R, I, S, E entirely.\n\nAdditionally, to maximize information, we should use:\n- Common consonants that are still possibilities, such as T, N, O, L, C, etc.\n- Other vowels: O, U are possible since we haven\'t tried them (A is confirmed present).\n\nAvailable letters: We have used R, A, I, S, E. So we know A is in the word, so we should reuse it in the new word but not at position 1. The rest of the letters should come from unguessed letters.\n\nSince the secret word has exactly 5 letters and we have eliminated R, I, S, E, the remaining letters to use are from the rest of the alphabet without R, I, S, E.\n\nAlso note: the secret word must have A somewhere, so we must include A in our new guess but at a position that is not 1 (index 1).\n\nPossible positions for A: index 0, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe must choose a word that fits the criteria and contains A in one of these positions, and the other four letters should be new (excluding R, I, S, E).\n\nWe should also aim for words with high-frequency letters to test them. Common letters left: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm words that:\n- Do not contain R, I, S, E.\n- Contain A, but not in the second position.\n\nFor example:\n- If A is at position 0: words like ""ABOUT"", ""AFTER"", ""ALONG"", ""ADMIT"", but note we have to avoid R, I, S, E: \n  - ""ABOUT"": contains B, O, U, T. Avoids R,I,S,E? Yes. And A is at 0. So valid? But let\'s check: positions: A at 0 (allowed), B, O, U, T. But we must avoid S? Yes, so ABOUT is acceptable? It contains O, U, T, and B. But note: the secret word contains A, but we don\'t know if it contains O, U, etc. This is a valid guess.\n- Alternatively, A at position 2: e.g., ""TRACK"", but has R and S? Avoid R and S -> not allowed.\n- Another word: ""MANGO"": M, A, N, G, O. A is at position 1? In ""MANGO"", positions: M(0), A(1), N(2), G(3), O(4). We cannot have A at position 1, so this is invalid for our guess? Because we know A cannot be at index 1. So we must not put A at index 1.\n\nTherefore, we look for words with A at indices 0,2,3,4.\n\nExamples of A at index 0: ABOUT, ABOVE (but E? Avoid E -> not allowed), ACTED (E? Avoid), ADAPT (avoid S? S not here? E? No, but D and P). ADAPT: A at 0, then D,A,P,T? No: A-D-A-P-T -> waits, ADAPT? It has A at 0 and 2? But we are allowed? We are forced to put A only where we guess? Actually, we are allowed to have A only at one position? No, a word can have multiple A\'s? But in the feedback, we know that A is present at least once, but it might be multiple? Since we are not limited.\n\nBut in our guess, we are free to put A wherever we want? Even if the word might have multiple A\'s? Yes, but the feedback will tell us.\n\nHowever, we have to avoid letters R,I,S,E anywhere.\n\nSo for index 0 A: \nCandidate: ""ABOUT"": A,B,O,U,T -> letters: A (at 0), B (new), O (new), U (new), T (new). Avoids R,I,S,E. So valid.\n\nAnother: ""ADULT"": A,D,U,L,T -> avoids forbidden letters? Yes. A at 0.\n\nBut position 1 is D? That is allowed. We have to put A in positions other than 1? We are placing A at 0, so that is okay.\n\nBut also, we can try with A at other positions.\n\nA at index 2: e.g., ""PLANT"": P,L,A,N,T -> A at index 2? Positions: P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if A is at index 2? We are just trying.\n\nA at index 3: e.g., ""CROWN"" has no A? ""CHAOS"" has H and O? But S? Avoid S -> CHAOS ends with S? Invalid. ""CLAPT""? Not a word. ""QUART"" has R? Avoid R.\n\nAlternatively, ""TUNAH""? Not a word. ""PIANO"" has I? Avoid I. So hard to find A at index 3.\n\nA at index 4: e.g., ""TUBAL""? has U,B,A,L -> A at position 3? Wait: T,U,B,A,L -> that\'s 5 letters? T(0), U(1), B(2), A(3), L(4). So A is at index 3? Then to have A at index 4: e.g., ""ALBUM"" puts A at 0 and U? Doesn\'t work. ""AVAIL"" has V,A,I at index 2? Avoid I. ""PIZZA"" has I and Z? Avoid I. So harder.\n\nSo easier: put A at index 0 or 2.\n\nWhich to choose? We want to test more common letters.\n\nAvailable high-frequency letters we haven\'t tried: T, N, O, L, C, H, D, U, M, P, B, etc.\n\nIf we choose a word with A at 0 and avoid R,I,S,E, we can use ABOUT: which uses O, U, T, B -> covering common letters? B is less common? O and T are very common.\n\nABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> letters: \nA is confirmed and we are placing it at 0 (might be confirmed? It must be tested).\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that places A not at 0? Because if the secret word does not have A at 0, then putting at 0 might not be efficient? But we have no information about positions, so by putting at index 0 we test that position.\n\nSimilarly, putting at index 2 tests that position.\n\nTo maximize coverage, we can try:\n\nCANDO? Not a word. PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> avoids R,I,S,E.\n\nBut in PLANT: A is at index 2. If the secret word has A at 2, then we\'ll get a check? Else \'-\'.\n\nBut PLANT uses P, L, N, T which are high frequency? T (6th), L (9th), N (6th), P (20th)? Not all top.\n\nAnother word: ALOHA? A and H? Has H at index 4? ALOHA: A at 0 and 4? We can use? But note: it has A twice? That\'s okay? But the feedback might get tricky? Since A is in the word, but we have two A\'s: one at 0 and one at 4. The feedback for each position:\n\nIf we put ALOHA:\n- First A (index 0): if correct? If the secret word has A at 0? Then ✓. \n- Second A (index 3? A-L-O-H-A? index 0: A, index1: L, index2: O, index3: H, index4: A). So index 4: second A.\n\nBut we know the secret word has at least one A. So if we get two \'-\'? Then the secret word has two A\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut also, O and L? and H.\n\nBut let\'s avoid repetition? Since we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters? Also, we want to test more distinct letters? Unless we think duplicates are likely? Not necessary.\n\nAlso, ALOHA has A at index 0 and 4? So it tests both positions? But we can\'t have both? Or we can? It\'s valid.\n\nBut note: we want to avoid duplicated letters? For more information? Yes, so if we have a word with two A\'s? Then only one A might be tested? We don\'t know.\n\nGiven that, perhaps words without duplicate letters are better? So we get clearer feedback? So ABOUT and PLANT have distinct letters? Yes.\n\nABOUT: A,B,O,U,T -> distinct letters? Yes.\n\nPLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> distinct? Yes.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MANGO"" is invalid? Because has A at index 1? So we can\'t use.\n\n""PATCH"": P,A,T,C,H -> A at index 1? No: positions? P(0), A(1), T(2), C(3), H(4). But index 1? We cannot put A at index 1 because of feedback? Exactly: we know that in the secret word, A is not at index 1. So if we put A at index 1? Then we will get \'x\' for that A? Which doesn\'t match? Because we know A is in the word? Not necessarily? Actually, the feedback tells us that A is in the word, so it must be present. If we put A at a position, we\'d expect either ✓ or \'-\'. But if we put at index 1? Then:\n- If the secret word does not have A at index 1? Then we get either \'-\' (if it\'s in the word) or \'x\'? But we know A is in the word? So we cannot get \'x\' for A. Therefore, the feedback for A when placed at index 1 would be \'-\'? Because it\'s still in the word but wrongly placed? Because we know it\'s in the word? Wait, no: the feedback per position only depends on the actual secret word.\n\nBut let me clarify: the feedback for each letter position is independent. For a letter in a given position:\n- If it matches exactly: ✓.\n- Else, if the letter appears elsewhere in the secret word: \'-\'.\n- Else: \'x\'.\n\nSo if we put A at index 1? Since the secret word has A but not at index 1, then we would get \'-\' for that letter? Because A is in the word but at a different position? So that\'s fine.\n\nBut wait: why have the first guess of RAISE shown A with \'-\'? It was at index 1? Then if we put A at index 1 again? It would also be \'-\'? Because the secret word doesn\'t have A there? But we don\'t know: it might be at a different position? So if we put it at index 1? It would tell us again that A is not at index 1? But we already know that? So it would be redundant.\n\nSo to maximize new information, we should put A in a position we haven\'t tested? We have tested index 1? So testing index 0,2,3,4? So put at 0,2,3,4, etc.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid index 1 for A? Since we know it cannot be there? So putting at index 1 would be redundant? Because we already know that position is wrong? So it\'s inefficient? So new guess should avoid putting A at index 1? Because we know ✓ can\'t be there.\n\nSo back to candidates: ABOUT: A at 0, PLANT: A at 2, etc.\n\nLet\'s think: ABOUT uses B,O,U,T? This tests four new letters? And we know A is present? So if ABOUT gets feedback: \n\nFor example, if the secret word has T? And O? Etc.\n\nA better word? How about using letters that are more common? There\'s PANTO? Not valid. Or PLANO? Not common.\n\nAnother word: ""CHANT"": C,H,A,N,T -> A at index 2? Positions: C(0), H(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes. And checks C,H,N,T? Also common? T and N are top, C and H are common.\n\nBut PLANT: P,L,A,N,T -> has L and N? Which is fine.\n\nBut we also note: the secret word does not contain R,I,S,E? So we mustn\'t use them.\n\nNow, which word? Between ABOUT and PLANT? Or other?\n\nAlso, don\'t forget that we have to avoid E? So ENDOW? Avoid E? Not valid. LOTUS? Avoid? L,O,T,U,S? Wait S? Avoid S.\n\nLOTUS: L,O,T,U,S? Yes, ends with S? So invalid because S is forbidden.\n\nSo ABOUT is valid? A,B,O,U,T? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, we can think of ""TOUCH"": T,O,U,C,H? But no A? But we must include A? In our guess? Yes! We have to, because we know A is in the secret word? Actually no: the guess doesn\'t have to include A? That is, we can guess a word without A? But that would be inefficient? Because we know A is present? So if we do not guess A? Then we might not get information about A? Specifically, we won\'t get feedback on whether our letters are correct? And we know A is in the word? So we want to test positions for A? Otherwise, we could have letters at certain positions but not A? And we are missing an opportunity to locate A.\n\nTherefore, to get more information about the secret word, we should include A in every guess until we know its position? So we must include A? Yes, it is crucial? Because if we don\'t, we might not find its position? And we have only 5 guesses left? So let\'s include A.\n\nThus, the word must include A? And at a position other than 1? Preferably new positions? And avoid R,I,S,E? And use new letters? And maximize distinct common letters.\n\nThus: \nABOUT: A-index0, B,O,U,T? New, distinct? Yes? O and T are common? U and B less so.\n\nPLANT: A-index2, P,L,A,N,T? Also distinct? L, N, T common? P common? \n\nAnother word: ""TABLE"": But avoid E? Not allowed? Because TABLE contains E? So invalid.\n\nSo ABOUT or PLANT? \n\nAlternatively, CLAMP: C,L,A,M,P? A at index 2? Can we write? CLAMP: positions C(0), L(1), A(2), M(3), P(4). Avoids forbidden letters? Yes? So C,L,M,P? Letters: C, L, A, M, P.\n\nBut O? We haven\'t tested? But PLANT has N and T which are more common? \n\nFrequency-wise: N and T are more common than C,L,M,P? \n\nBut CLAMP: testing C,L,M,P? That\'s less common.\n\nSo perhaps PLANT is better? Has T and N? Both top letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DAUNT"" : D,A,U,N,T? A at index 1? Oh, A at index 1? We want to avoid that? Because we know it\'s wrong? So DAUNT would put A at position 1? So that would lead to \'-\'? Which we already know? So inefficient? So avoid words that put A at index 1? Correct.\n\nTherefore, must have A at index?? 0, 2, 3, 4? \n\nSo ABOUT: A at 0 (first letter) -> test if A is first? \nPLANT: A at 2 (third letter) -> test if A is third?\nCHAMP: C,H,A,M,P? A at 2? Valid? CHAMP: C(0), H(1), A(2), M(3), P(4). Avoids? Yes.\n\nBut H and M not as common.\n\nPANTS: Avoid S? Invalid? Because has S.\n\nSo PLANT or ABOUT? \n\nI think PLANT is good because it has T, N? which are high frequency and we haven\'t tried.\n\nSimilarly, ""PATIO"": However, avoid I? PATIO has I? Index 3? P-A-T-I-O? Avoid I? Yes, we cannot use I? So invalid.\n\nSo after analysis, two candidates: ABOUT and PLANT.\n\nWord frequency: The most common vowels and consonants? Since we don\'t know, ABOUT uses O and U? U is less common vowel? PLANT uses L and N? Both common? But O? We haven\'t tested O? In ABOUT, we test O? So ABOUT allows us to test O? Which is more common than L?.\n\nAlso, T is tested in both? But ABOUT tests O? So I prefer ABOUT? Because if O is in the word? We might get \'-\'.\n\nMoreover, ABOUT has U? Also vowel? But less common.\n\nBut compared to PLANT: PLANT tests L and N? N is common? L is common? \n\nLet\'s count? ABOUT: tests A (at0), B,O,U,T? Letters: A already known? So new: B,O,U,T? All new.\n\nPLANT: A (at2) and P,L,N,T? New: P,L,N,T.\n\nO is the 5th most common letter? L is 9th? N is 7th? T is 6th? O is more common than L? \n\nBut then ABOUT tests O and U? U is less common? \n\nBut PLANT tests L? Also not top? \n\nSo ABOUT has O? Very good.\n\nBut U is 13th? In PLANT, we have L:9th? N:7th? T:6th? And P:20th? ABOUT: O:5th, T:6th, U:13th, B:19th? Average better? \n\nAlso, ABOUT avoids P? Which is less common? \n\nSo I think ABOUT is better? Because it tests O? Which is a vowel and common.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""ABOUT"".\n\nBut note: PLANT has two of the top 10: T, N? ABOUT has O, T? Both top 10? So similar.\n\nBut let me think: we don\'t know. \n\nAnother candidate: ""OCTAL""? Contains O,C,T,A,L? A at index 3? Positions: O(0), C(1), T(2), A(3), L(4). Avoids? Yes? So A? At index 3? So tests index 3? Which is new? But letters: O, C, T, A, L? \n\nAlso tests C? And O? Etc? But now we have used O? So in ABOUT, O is at index 1? In OCTAL, O at index 0?\n\nBut OCTAL? Is it a word? Yes? Meaning binary? \n\nBut we also haven\'t tested O? So why not? \n\nABOUT: O at index 1? And T at end? \n\nBut OCTAL? Since we know A is in the word? And we are testing O, etc? \n\nI think ABOUT is more common word? And easier? \n\nAlso, AVAILABLE letters? But let\'s go.\n\nTo summarize: We decide to use ""ABOUT"" as our next guess? Because:\n- It includes A at index 0? A new position.\n- Uses O, U, T, B? Which we haven\'t tried? \n- Avoids R,I,S,E.\n\nNow feedback: If A is in position 0? We get ✓? If not, but A is in the word? We get \'-\'? Similarly for others.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""ABOUT"".\n\nBut note: the word must be English? ABOUT is.\n\nSo <guess>ABOUT</guess>### Step-by-Step Thought Process for Second Guess\n\n1. **Understanding Feedback from First Guess**:\n   - Previous guess: ""RAISE"" → Feedback: R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)\n   - This indicates:\n     - The letter **A** is in the secret word but **not in the second position** (index 1).\n     - The letters **R, I, S, E are not in the secret word** at all.\n   - Therefore, the secret word must include **A** somewhere (positions 0, 2, 3, or 4 based on 0-based indexing), and it must avoid R, I, S, E entirely.\n\n2. **Key Constraints for New Guess**:\n   - Must be a **valid 5-letter English word**.\n   - Must **include A** to test for its correct position (since we know it\'s present).\n   - **A cannot be at index 1** (second position), so it must be placed at index 0, 2, 3, or 4.\n   - Must **avoid R, I, S, E** in all positions.\n   - Should prioritize testing new **high-frequency letters** to gather more information, focusing on unguessed vowels (like O, U) and consonants (like T, N, L, C, B, P, etc.).\n   - Prefer a word with **distinct letters** (no duplicates) to maximize new information.\n\n3. **Candidate Word Selection**:\n   - Start by brainstorming words containing A with positions at indices 0, 2, 3, or 4, while excluding R, I, S, E.\n   - Example candidates:\n     - **A at index 0**: Words like ""ABOUT"" (A at 0, avoids R,I,S,E), ""ADOPT"" (A at 0, but contains O and P? Good, but ""ABOUT"" includes O).\n     - **A at index 2**: Words like ""PLANT"" (A at 2, avoids R,I,S,E), ""CHANT"" (A at 2, but ""PLANT"" tests more common letters).\n     - **A at index 3 or 4**: Harder due to constraints (e.g., ""AVAIL"" invalid due to I; ""CABAL"" invalid due to L at index 4 being less ideal). Less common options.\n   - Compare top candidates:\n     - **""ABOUT""**: Places A at index 0 (new position), uses letters A,B,O,U,T → tests new common letters O (5th most frequent) and T (6th), avoids redundancies.\n     - **""PLANT""**: Places A at index 2 (new position), uses letters P,L,A,N,T → tests N (7th), T (6th), L (9th); but P is less common (20th).\n   - Preference: Prioritize ""ABOUT"" over ""PLANT"" because:\n     - It tests the vowel **O** (more frequent than L or N), which is common in 5-letter words.\n     - Letters O and T are top-tier; U and B are valuable for coverage.\n     - Avoids inefficient reuse of A at index 1 already ruled out.\n   - Confirm validity: ""ABOUT"" is a common English word, eligible.\n\n4. **Expected Feedback Insights**:\n   - Testing **A at index 0**: Will confirm if correct (✓) or misplaced (-).\n   - Testing **O, U, T, B**: Any ✓ or - will help locate positions or new letters.\n   - Feedback will eliminate/reduce possibilities faster, especially for A\'s position.\n\nThus, ""ABOUT"" is a strategic second guess based on maximizing new letter coverage and positional testing within constraints.\n\n<guess>ABOUT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n- Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(-), I(x), S(x), E(x)\n  - This means R, I, S, E are not in the word at all. A is in the word but not in position 1 (index 1).\n- Guess 2: ABOUT -> A(-), B(x), O(-), U(x), T(x)\n  - Interpretation: \n    - A(-): A is in the secret word but not in position 0 (since in ABOUT, A is at index 0). So A is present but not at index 0 or index 1.\n    - B(x): B is not in the secret word at all.\n    - O(-): O is in the word but not in position 2? Wait, in ABOUT, O is at index 3? Wait, let\'s break down the positions:\n        ABOUT: \n          Index 0: A -> got (-) meaning present but wrong position? But then we have O at index? Let\'s see:\n          A(0), B(1), O(2), U(3), T(4) -> positions: \n          A at 0 -> feedback (-) -> A is present but not at 0.\n          B at 1 -> (x) -> B not in word.\n          O at 2 -> (-) -> O is in the word but not at position 2.\n          U at 3 -> (x) -> U not in word.\n          T at 4 -> (x) -> T not in word.\n\nSo feedback: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)\n\nTherefore, now we know:\n- The secret word contains A and O, but A is not at position 0 or 1, and O is not at position 2.\n- Additionally, B, U, T are not in the word (so we avoid B, U, T).\n- Also from the first guess: R, I, S, E are not in the word.\n\nSo total letters eliminated: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.\n\nLetters that must be included: A and O.\n\nLetters tested and not in word: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.\n\nTherefore, for the new guess:\n- Must be a valid 5-letter word.\n- Must include both A and O? Yes, because we know they are present? Exactly, because A got \'-\' in both positions, meaning it\'s in the word? Similarly, O got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word? And both are not placed correctly in the positions we tried? So they must appear elsewhere? And there might be more letters? The secret word must contain A and O? And the rest? We don\'t know.\n\nBut since we have only two letters confirmed? A and O? Then the remaining three letters are from the unused alphabet? Without the eliminated letters? And without A and O? But A and O can be reused? Actually, we don\'t know if duplicate letters? But feedback didn\'t show duplicate for A? In ABOUT, we had only one A? Then secret might have as few as one A? Similarly for O? But it\'s not necessary.\n\nNow, from the feedback:\n- A is not at index 0, not at index 1 -> so must be at index 2, 3, or 4 (positions 3, 4, or 5? Counting positions: 0,1,2,3,4).\n- Similarly, O is not at index 2? So where? Not at 2? So at index 0,1,3, or 4? But note we also tried O elsewhere? Only at position 2? In ABOUT? So we don\'t know about other positions? So we must test O at a new position? Similarly for A.\n\nMoreover, since B, U, T are eliminated? So we avoid those.\n\nAlso, eliminated letters: R, I, S, E, B, U, T? Total: R, I, S, E, B, U, T.\n\nWhat letters are available? The alphabet minus these? And we must include A and O? But they are already known? We can use them? But also, we need new letters.\n\nAvailable letters: A, O, and all others except: R,I,S,E,B,U,T? So:\n\nAvailable: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut we only have five letters? And must include A and O? So we need to pick three more? Without duplicates? To maximize information? Or with duplicates? Not necessarily? But at least include A and O.\n\nNow, the secret word must have A? So A must be at one of positions 2,3,4? Because not at 0 or 1? So A can be at index 2, 3, or 4? Similarly, O must be at index? Not at 2? So at 0,1,3,4? But note: positions? Index 0: first? Index 1: second? Index 2: third? Index 3: fourth? Index 4: fifth.\n\nAlso, we know that O is in the word? But we haven\'t tested other positions? So we must test O at one of 0,1,3,4? And test A at one of 2,3,4? Without interference.\n\nMoreover, we must avoid eliminated letters? So pick other common letters? Such as N, L, C, H, D, etc.\n\nNow, we need to place A at an untried position? So 2,3,4? Similarly O? So positions not 2? So can be 0,1,3,4.\n\nBut note? We have already tried? For A: tried index 1 in RAISE and index 0 in ABOUT? So must try at 2,3, or 4? For O: we tried at index 2? So must try at 0,1,3,4.\n\nTherefore, a good guess would have:\n- A at position 2,3, or 4? And O at one of 0,1,3,4? But avoiding overlap? Such that we can get maximum info.\n\nAdditionally, to avoid? We must include? We have to test both.\n\nAlso, we want to test new common consonants? Like L, N, C, H, P, M, etc.\n\nNow, candidate words:\n\nFirst, A at index 2? Then O at one of the others? Example: ""COMAK""? Not valid? ""GODLY"" but no A? Need A? So must have A.\n\nConsider:\n- O can be at index 0: e.g., ""OAK??"" what? OAKEN? But E not allowed? Or ""OAKUM""? Avoid U? U eliminated? OAKUM has U? Not allowed? ""OAKEN"" has E? Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, O at index 0? Words with O and A? And avoiding eliminated? ""OCEAN"" avoid E? ""OCALA""? O-C-A-L-A? Valid? OCALA? Is it a word? City? But then? Positions: O(0), C(1), A(2), L(3), A(4). But duplicated A? And we have A at positions 2 and 4? But also? We don\'t know? Also feedback: first A? At index 2? Is not previously tested? And A at index 4? Similarly? And O at 0? Which we haven\'t tested.\n\nBut OCALA? Is it accepted? It\'s a proper noun? The problem doesn\'t say? But the word must be English? Common words? But the feedback? We have not been restricted? So perhaps?\n\nBut better to use common words? Something like ""PLANO"": but avoid S? No? But has O? And A? Positions? P-L-A-N-O? So O at index 4? A at index 2? And we avoid eliminated? P,L,A,N,O? Avoids? P,L,N? New? And not prohibited? So yes? ""PLANE""? Avoid E? Not allowed.\n\nSo ""PLANO"": \n- Positions: \n  0: P?\n  1: L?\n  2: A? (we know A can be at 2? So placed there? We\'ll find out)\n  3: N?\n  4: O? \n\nBut O at index 4? We haven\'t tested index 4? So possible? Similarly.\n\nSimilarly, ""COMA?"": COMAE? Not? COMA has 4 letters? Need 5? So COBRA? But R? Avoid? R eliminated? So not.\n\nAnother: ""POHAY""? Not common? Better?\n\nAlternatively, A at index 3? Then? O at 0? 1? or 4? For example, ""FOYAL""? Uncommon? ""LOAM...""? But L-O-A-M-Y? Not valid? ""DOLLY"" no A? Need A? So hard?\n\nA at index 4? Then O? For example, ""????A"" with A at end? And O somewhere? E.g., ""ALCOA""? But duplicated A? And O? Positions: A(0), L(1), C(2), O(3), A(4). But A at 0 and 4? And we used O at 3? But we know A cannot be at 0? Because already tried? So putting A at 0 would be inefficient? And eliminated? Because we know A is not at 0? So the A at 0 would get \'-\', which we already know A is in the word? Worse, it would confuse? Because we don\'t learn new? So better not? So avoid positions that are known to be wrong? Because A at index 0 doesn\'t change? So we get \'-\'? Without learning anything? Same for A at index 1? So we must not put A at index 0 or index 1? In the new guess? Similarly, for O? If we put O at index 2? We know it\'s wrong? So we shouldn\'t put O at index 2? Because we\'ll get \'-\'? Which we already know? Not efficient.\n\nTherefore, in the new guess, we must avoid:\n- A at index 0 or 1?\n- O at index 2?\n\nSo permissible:\n- A at index 2,3,4?\n- O at index 0,1,3,4?\n\nAnd we require the word to include both? And avoid eliminated letters: R,I,S,E,B,U,T? And avoid using the same letter twice? For clarity? Unless necessary.\n\nAdditionally, we want to test new common letters? Such as N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.\n\nCandidate words? With A at index 2? Then O at other allowed positions? \n\nOptions:\n- A at 2: \n  - O at index 0: e.g., ""O P A ??""\n    - Word: ""OPAHS""? O-P-A-H-S? Avoid S? S eliminated? Invalid? ""OPACT""? Not valid?\n  - O at index 1: e.g., ""? O A ? ?"" \n    - ""COATH""? Avoid H? Not valid? ""GOADS"" avoid S? ""GOLEM"" no A? \n    - ""DOGAN""? Not known? Try L? ""LOAVY""? No? \n\nAlternatively, A at index 3? Then? O at 0? ""O??A?"" \n\nSimilarly, ""OLGA?"" no A? ""CONGA"" avoid N? No? CONGA: C,O,N,G,A? Positions: C(0), O(1), N(2), G(3), A(4)? But then O at index 1? Which is permissible? And A at index 4? Which we haven\'t tested? So A at 4? And O at 1? \n\nBut letters: C,O,N,G? N? What? CONGA: C(0), O(1), N(2), G(3), A(4). \n\nNow, is CONGA valid? English word? Meaning drum dance? Yes? \n\nValid? Also, avoids? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? \n\nSimilarly, O at index 3? And other? \n\nBut CONGA: \n- O is placed at index 1? \n- A at index 4? \n\nBoth positions? Are we testing O at index 1? Which is new? Because we only tested O at index 2? Similarly? A at 4? New?\n\nBut note: index 2 for O? We only tried position 2? So index1 for O? Not tried? Index4 for A? Not tried? \n\nAlso, letters C, N, G? All not tried? \n\nCompare? With PLANO? Which had A at 2? O at 4? \n\nBut CONGA has O at 1? Which is the second position? And we know A isn\'t at second position? But O? Could be? \n\nYes? \n\nSimilarly? PLANO: \n- Positions: P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), O(4)\n- Avoids? Not: P,L? A(2) and O(4)? And N? \n\nFeedback: we could get for P,L,N? If they are present? But note: we know A is at 2? Which we test? And O at 4? Test? \n\nBut CONGA: \n- C, O, N, G, A? \n- Places O at index 1? Which is previously unassigned? \n\nSo CONGA? \nMoreover? CONGA includes N? Which is common? Good. \n\nBut another candidate: ""POLKA""? But avoid K and O? Position? P O L K A? O at 1? A at 4? Similarly? But K? Can? But POLKA? Is valid? But letters P,O,L,K,A? Avoids? R,I,S,E,B,U,T? Yes? \n\nBut K? Not common? So CONGA better? G? Less common? \n\nBut CONGA tests C? N? G? \n\nPLANO tests P? L? N? \n\nWhich is better? L? More common than G? \n\nLetter frequencies? Among available? \n- Common letters: L (9th), N (7th), C (10th), H (11th), M (12th), P (19th), etc. \n\nSo N and L are preferable? \n\nBut CONGA has: C? 10th? N? 7th? G? 20th? \nPLANO? P? 19th? L? 9th? N? 7th? \n\nSo average: PLANO: P19, L9, N7 -> one top? \nCONGA: C10, N7, G20 -> N7? \n\nBut PLANO? Has O? Which is known? And A? So new letters are P,L,N? \nSimilarly CONGA? New letters C,N,G? \n\nSo I think PLANO? Is valid? And preferable? Because L and N? \n\nBut PLANO? Ends with O? And A? Placements? \n\nAlso? PLANO? City? But English word? Acceptable? \n\nThen? What about? ""CANOLI""? Too long? \n\nAnother word: ""MANGO""? But? M A N G O? Positions: M(0), A(1), N(2), G(3), O(4)? But wait? We cannot put A at index 1? Because we know A cannot be at position 1? So MANGO? Would put A at index 1? Which will get \'-\'? Which we already know? Redundant? And? We want to avoid? So invalid? Because? We know A is at index 1? Must get \'-\'? No? But we don\'t learn anything new? For A? \n\nTherefore? Not efficient? So we avoid words with A at index 1? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nThus? PLANO: \n  P(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), O(4) -> \n  A is at index 2? Which we haven\'t? And O at index 4? Haven\'t? \n\nAlso A? We haven\'t tested index 2? So good? \n\nMoreover? L? Common? \n\nSimilarly? We can consider? ""CLANG""? Avoid C,L,A,N,G? Positions: C(0), L(1), A(2), N(3), G(4)? Same as PLANO? But G instead of O? But we must have O? So cannot? Because if we omit O? Then no feedback on O? So must include O? \n\nSo PLANO? Seems good? \n\nBut PLANO? Has O? \n\nAlternatively? ""PLANE""? Has E? Not allowed? \n\n""PLANK""? Has K? Avoiding eliminated? Yes? K? But K less common? And no O? But we must include O? \n\nSo PLANO? Includes O? \n\nBut PLANO? Contains O and A? And P,L,N? \n\nAlso? ""ALONE""? But A at index 0? And we know A cannot be at 0? So index 0? Will be \'-\'? Redundant? And contains E? Eliminated? Invalid? \n\nTherefore? PLANO? Is a candidate? \n\nSimilarly? ""CANOE""? \nPositions: C(0), A(1), N(2), O(3), E(4)? \nBut? Problems: \n- A at index 1? But we know A not at 1? So we get \'-\' for that? Redundant? \n- Also? E at index 4? Eliminated? Not allowed? \n\nSo invalid? \n\n""FLORA""? Avoid R? R eliminated? \n\n""VODKA""? Avoid? K? And?

I choose PLANO? \n\nSo <guess>PLANO</guess>### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n\n1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1: RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)**:\n     - Eliminates **R, I, S, E** from the word: They are not present.\n     - **A** is in the secret word but not at position 1 (index 1).\n   - **Guess 2: ABOUT → A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)**:\n     - Eliminates **B, U, T** from the word: They are not present.\n     - **A** is confirmed in the word but not at position 0 (index 0). Combined with Guess 1, A cannot be at positions 0 or 1, so possible positions are 2, 3, or 4.\n     - **O** is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2), leaving possible positions 0, 1, 3, or 4.\n   - **Collective Eliminations**: Secret word cannot contain **R, I, S, E, B, U, T**. This leaves available letters: A, O, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n   - **Inclusions**: Secret word **must include A and O**, as both received ""-"" (misplaced) feedback, confirming their presence.\n\n2. **Constraints for New Guess**:\n   - The word must include **A and O**.\n   - **A** must be placed at an **untested position**: index 2, 3, or 4 (not 0 or 1).\n   - **O** must be placed at an **untested position**: index 0, 1, 3, or 4 (not 2).\n   - Avoid using eliminated letters: **R, I, S, E, B, U, T**.\n   - Prioritize distinct letters to test new positions and maximize information.\n   - Focus on testing high-frequency consonants like **L, N, P, M, C** (among the top 20 English letters) for better coverage.\n\n3. **Candidate Word Selection**:\n   - Words considered:\n     - **""PLANO""**: A at index 2, O at index 4. Tests new positions and includes common letters (P, L, N). Valid English word (city/hobby meaning).\n     - **""CONGA""**: A at index 4, O at index 1. Also tests new positions and includes common letters (C, N, G), but G is less frequent.\n     - **""MOCHA""**: A at index 4, O at index 1. Tests M, C, H, but frequencies are moderate.\n     - **""NOMAD""**: A at index 3, O at index 1. Tests N, M, D, which are common.\n   - **Choice Rationale**: ""PLANO"" is chosen because:\n     - Places **A at index 2** (new position) and **O at index 4** (new position), testing both for potential correctness.\n     - Includes high-frequency consonants: **L** (9th most common), **N** (7th), and **P** (19th).\n     - Avoids duplicates or eliminated letters and maximizes new letter coverage.\n     - Efficiently narrows down positions for A and O based on feedback.\n     - Valid English word (recognized in dictionaries).\n\n4. **Expected Feedback Insights**:\n   - **Position Testing**: Response for A at index 2 may reveal if it is correct (✓) or misplaced (-), pinning down its position. Similarly for O at 4.\n   - **Letter Testing**: Feedback for P, L, N will help eliminate or confirm new letters, reducing the word pool significantly.\n   - On incorrect placement, constraints tighten for subsequent guesses (e.g., A locked to index 3 or 4).\n\nThus, ""PLANO"" strategically leverages known constraints, maximizes information gain, and adheres to the rules.\n\n<guess>PLANO</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: PLANO -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) O(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from previous guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n  R: not in the word\n  A: in the word but not in position 1 (index 1)\n  I: not in the word\n  S: not in the word\n  E: not in the word\n\nGuess 2: ABOUT -> A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)\nMeaning:\n  A: in the word but not in position 0 (index 0) -> so A is not at 0 or 1\n  B: not in the word\n  O: in the word but not in position 2 (index 2)\n  U: not in the word\n  T: not in the word\n\nGuess 3: PLANO -> P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) O(-)\nMeaning:\n  P: not in the word\n  L: in the word but not in position 1 (index 1) of the guess (which is the second letter)\n  A: in the word but not in position 2 (index 2) of the guess (which is the third letter)\n  N: not in the word\n  O: in the word but not in position 4 (index 4) of the guess (which is the fifth letter)\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. Letters that are in the word: \n   - A (from multiple guesses)\n   - O (from ABOUT and PLANO)\n   - L (from PLANO)\n\n   We also know that A, O, and L are present.\n\n2. Letters that are not in the word (from all feedback):\n   - R, I, S, E (from RAISE)\n   - B, U, T (from ABOUT)\n   - P, N (from PLANO)\n\n   So eliminated: R, I, S, E, B, U, T, P, N.\n\n3. Positions for A:\n   - Not at index 0 (from ABOUT: A at 0 was -)\n   - Not at index 1 (from RAISE: A at 1 was -)\n   - Not at index 2 (from PLANO: A at 2 was -)\n   So A must be at index 3 or 4.\n\n4. Positions for O:\n   - Not at index 2 (from ABOUT: O at 2 was -)\n   - Not at index 4 (from PLANO: O at 4 was -)\n   So O must be at index 0, 1, or 3.\n\n5. Positions for L:\n   - From PLANO: L was at index 1 and got \'-\', meaning L is in the word but not at index 1.\n   So L is not at index 1, and must be at index 0, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe also know the word has 5 letters and must include A, O, L, and two other letters that are not eliminated.\n\nAvailable letters (not eliminated): \nA, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut note: A, O, L are already in the word, so we need to choose two more from the remaining: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also have constraints on positions.\n\nLet\'s consider the possible positions for A, O, and L.\n\nA: only 3 or 4.\nO: 0, 1, or 3. But note: if O is at 3, then A cannot be at 3 (since one letter per position). Similarly, if A is at 3, then O cannot be at 3. So they cannot both be at 3.\n\nPossible cases:\n\nCase 1: A at 3, then O at 0 or 1 (since O cannot be at 3 and 4 is taken by A? No, A is at 3, so O can be at 0,1, or 4? But wait, O cannot be at 4 because in PLANO we had O at 4 and it was \'-\', so O is not at 4. Therefore, if A is at 3, then O must be at 0 or 1.\n\nCase 2: A at 4, then O can be at 0, 1, or 3.\n\nAlso, L must be placed at one of 0,2,3,4 but not conflicting with A and O.\n\nWe need to form a word that satisfies these.\n\nWe also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\nFirst, if A is at 3 (position 4th letter) and O at 0 (first) or 1 (second):\n\n- O at 0, A at 3: then the word is O _ _ A _\n  We need to fill positions 1, 2, and 4 (index 1,2,4). Also, L must be in one of these? Or at 3? But A is at 3, so L cannot be at 3. So L must be at 0,1,2,4. But 0 is O, so L must be at 1,2, or 4.\n\n  Example: \n    Position 0: O\n    Position 3: A\n    Then we have positions 1,2,4 to fill, and one of them must be L (and the other two are new letters).\n\n  Possible words: \n    O _ _ A L -> but then L is at 4? So word: O??AL\n    What letters? We have to use two new letters from available (C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z) and L.\n\n  Examples: \n    ""OCEAN"" -> but E and N are eliminated -> invalid.\n    ""OCAL?"" -> not a word? \n    ""OFAAL"" -> not a word.\n\n  Alternatively, L at position 1: O L _ A _ -> then we need to fill 2 and 4. \n    Example: ""OLGA?"" -> not 5 letters? ""OLDAE"" -> E eliminated. ""OLDAM"" -> M? But then O L D A M? Is that a word? Not common. \n\n  Or L at position 2: O _ L A _ -> then we need to fill 1 and 4. \n    Example: ""O W L A Y"" -> OWL? But OWLAY? Not a word. ""O F L A G"" -> FLAG? But O F L A G -> ""OFLAG"" not a word? \n\n  This seems difficult. \n\nSecond, if A is at 3 and O at 1: \n  Then word: _ O _ A _\n  Positions: 0,2,4 to fill, and one must be L (at 0,2, or 4).\n\n  Example: L at 0: L O _ A _ -> then we need to fill 2 and 4. \n    ""L O C A L"" -> but L repeated? And we don\'t know if L is repeated? But in PLANO, we had only one L? But the secret word might have two L\'s? However, in PLANO, the L was at index 1 and got \'-\', meaning at least one L is present. But it could be more? So ""LOCAL"" has two L\'s? But we have eliminated letters? C is available? But ""LOCAL"" has L at 0 and 4? \n\n    But note: we have to avoid eliminated letters? ""LOCAL"" has L,O,C,A,L? But L is repeated? And we are allowed? But the feedback for PLANO only told us that L is present (at least one) but not the count. So ""LOCAL"" is possible? \n\n    However, we have to check: \n      Position 0: L -> if the secret word has L at 0? Then we get ✓? \n      Position 1: O -> we know O is at 1? Then we get ✓? \n      But we don\'t know if O is at 1? We are testing it.\n\n    But ""LOCAL"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n    But we have to see if it fits: \n      A is at 3? Yes.\n      O at 1? Yes.\n      L at 0 and 4? \n\n    But we know L is present? And we are testing two L\'s? The feedback will tell us if there are two? \n\n    However, we are trying to form a guess? So we can use ""LOCAL""? \n\n    But note: we have eliminated N, so no problem? \n\n    But let\'s see the letters: L, O, C, A, L? \n    C is new? \n\n    But we are allowed? \n\n    Alternatively, without repetition? \n\n  But let\'s see if there are other words? \n\n  If L at 2: _ O L A _ -> then we need to fill 0 and 4. \n    Example: ""C O L A H"" -> ""COLAH"" not a word? ""D O L A M"" -> ""DOLAM"" not a word? \n\n  If L at 4: _ O _ A L -> then we need to fill 0 and 2. \n    Example: ""H O G A L"" -> ""HOGAL"" not a word? ""F O Y A L"" -> not a word? \n\nSo ""LOCAL"" is a candidate? \n\nNow, the other case: A at 4 (last letter) and O at 0,1, or 3.\n\n- If O at 0 and A at 4: then word: O _ _ _ A\n  Then L must be at 1,2,3 (since 0 is O, 4 is A). \n  Example: O L _ _ A -> ""OLIVA"" -> but I is eliminated? ""OLEMA"" -> E eliminated? ""OLAMA"" -> not a word? \n\n- If O at 1 and A at 4: then word: _ O _ _ A\n  Then L must be at 0,2,3. \n  Example: L O _ _ A -> ""LOCA?"" -> ""LOCA"" is 4 letters? ""LOCAL"" we considered? But in ""LOCAL"", A is at 3? Not at 4? \n\n  We need A at 4: so _ O _ _ A -> \n    L at 0: L O _ _ A -> ""L O C H A"" -> ""LOCHA""? Not common? ""L O G A A"" -> not? \n\n  Or L at 2: _ O L _ A -> ""C O L Z A"" -> not? ""G O L D A"" -> ""GOLDA""? Not a word? \n\n  Or L at 3: _ O _ L A -> ""C O M L A"" -> ""COMLA""? Not? \n\n- If O at 3 and A at 4: then word: _ _ _ O A\n  Then L must be at 0,1,2. \n  Example: L _ _ O A -> ""L A V O A"" -> not? \n           _ L _ O A -> ""A L ? O A"" -> but A at 0? We know A is not at 0? So cannot? \n           _ _ L O A -> ""C A L O A"" -> not? ""K Y L O A"" -> not? \n\nThis seems difficult? \n\nAlternatively, we have the case where A is at 4 and O at 1? We tried? \n\nBut we have a candidate: ""LOCAL"" for the case A at 3 and O at 1? \n\nBut in ""LOCAL"", A is at 3? and O at 1? \n\nBut we also have the possibility of A at 4? \n\nBut we found no good words for A at 4? \n\nAnother candidate: if A is at 4 and O at 0? \n\nBut we tried? \n\nWhat about O at 3 and A at 4? \n\nWe need a word: _ _ _ O A\n\nAnd L must be at 0,1, or 2. \n\nExample: \n  L at 0: L _ _ O A -> ""L A V O A"" -> invalid? \n  L at 1: _ L _ O A -> ""A L ? O A"" -> but A at 0? Not allowed? \n  L at 2: _ _ L O A -> ""C A L O A"" -> not? \n\nBut ""K Y L O A"" not a word? \n\nWhat about ""ALAMO""? But A at 0? Not allowed? \n\nAnother idea: ""DOGMA""? But D O G M A? \n  Positions: \n    0: D? \n    1: O? \n    2: G? \n    3: M? \n    4: A? \nBut then A at 4? and O at 1? \nAnd we avoid eliminated? D, O, G, M, A? \nBut we know L is in the word? But ""DOGMA"" has no L? So it cannot be? Because we know L is present? \n\nSo we must include L? \n\nTherefore, the word must have A, O, and L? \n\nSo back to ""LOCAL"": \n  It has A at 3? and O at 1? and L at 0 and 4? \n  But we know L is present? And it has two L\'s? That\'s acceptable? \n\n  Also, it has C? which is new? \n\n  And it fits: \n    A at 3? -> we haven\'t tested A at 3? \n    O at 1? -> we haven\'t tested O at 1? \n    L at 0 and 4? -> we haven\'t tested L at 0 or 4? \n\n  So we can test multiple things? \n\n  But note: in PLANO, we tested L at index 1? and got \'-\'? meaning L is present but not at 1? So if we put L at 0? we might get ✓ or \'-\'? \n\n  Similarly, O at 1? we don\'t know? \n\n  So ""LOCAL"" is a valid candidate? \n\nBut is there a word with distinct letters? \n\nAnother candidate: ""LOACH""? \n  L O A C H? \n  But then A at 2? But we know A cannot be at 2? (from PLANO: A at 2 was -? and we know it\'s not at 2) -> so if we put A at 2? we get \'-\'? which we already know? So inefficient? \n\n  Also, O at 1? which is new? \n\n  But A at 2? is redundant? \n\n  So not good? \n\nAnother: ""LOHAN""? but N eliminated? \n\n""LOFAM""? not a word? \n\nSo ""LOCAL"" seems a good candidate? \n\nBut let\'s check the feedback we would get if the word is not ""LOCAL""? \n\nWe are guessing to get information? \n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have A at 3? to test the other case? \n\nBut we have to cover the possibilities? \n\nSince A can only be at 3 or 4? and we haven\'t tested 3? we can test A at 3? \n\nSimilarly, O at 1? we haven\'t tested? \n\nAlso, we need to test L? \n\nBut in ""LOCAL"", we test L at 0 and 4? \n\nBut we might get ambiguous feedback? \n\nAnother word: ""COMA?"" -> but 4 letters? \n\n""COALA""? but A at 4? and O at 1? and L at 3? \n  C O M A L? -> ""COMAL"" is a word?

We have the following feedback history:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
  - R, I, S, E are not in the word.
  - A is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1).

Guess 2: ABOUT -> A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)
  - B, U, T are not in the word.
  - A is in the word but not at position 0 (index 0).
  - O is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2).

Guess 3: PLANO -> P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) O(-)
  - P, N are not in the word.
  - L is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1).
  - A is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2).
  - O is in the word but not at position 4 (index 4).

Guess 4: COMAL -> C(-) O(✓) M(x) A(✓) L(✓)
  - C is in the word but not at position 0 (index 0).
  - O is correct at position 1 (index 1).
  - M is not in the word.
  - A is correct at position 3 (index 3).
  - L is correct at position 4 (index 4).

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. Correctly placed letters:
   - O is at position 1 (index 1).
   - A is at position 3 (index 3).
   - L is at position 4 (index 4).

   So the word has the form: _ O _ A L

2. Known absent letters: R, I, S, E, B, U, T, P, N, M.

3. Present letters but not in the correct position (from COMAL):
   - C is in the word but not at position 0.

4. We also know from previous guesses that:
   - A was previously misplaced at positions 0, 1, and 2, but now we know it's fixed at 3.
   - O was misplaced at positions 2 and 4, but now fixed at 1.
   - L was misplaced at position 1, but now fixed at 4.

5. The word must contain C (since we got '-' for C in COMAL, meaning it is present but not at index 0). Also, note that C is the only letter we know is present but not yet placed, and it cannot be at position 0.

6. The word has 5 letters, and we have 4 letters already placed: O at 1, A at 3, L at 4. The first letter (index 0) and the third letter (index 2) are missing. But note: the third letter is at index 2, which is the third position.

   Current known: 
     Position 0: unknown (but cannot be C, because C is present but not at 0? Actually, the feedback says C is not at 0, but it is in the word, so it must be at one of the other positions. However, positions 1, 3, and 4 are already taken by O, A, L. So the only remaining position is index 2 (the third letter). Therefore, C must be at position 2.

   But wait: the word is _ O _ A L, so the blanks are at index 0 and index 2.

   We know C is in the word and not at 0, so it must be at index 2? Because positions 1,3,4 are occupied by O,A,L and are fixed. So the only possibility for C is at index 2.

   However, we must confirm: the feedback for COMAL had C at index 0 and got '-', meaning C is in the word but not at 0. Since the other positions (1,3,4) are taken by O,A,L (which are fixed and different from C), then C must be at the only remaining position: index 2.

   Therefore, the word must be: _ O C A L

   Now, we only need to find the first letter (index 0). It must be a letter that is not in the eliminated list and not C (because C is at index 2), and not O,A,L (which are already placed).

   Eliminated letters: R,I,S,E,B,U,T,P,N,M.

   Available letters: the alphabet minus eliminated and minus the placed letters (O,A,L,C) but note C is placed at 2, so we don't use it again? The first letter must be a new letter? Or it could be a duplicate? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

   However, the feedback has not shown any duplicates, and we have no reason to assume duplicates. So we assume distinct letters? But the problem doesn't say the word has distinct letters, so duplicates are possible? But in this case, we have C at index 2, and the first letter must be a letter that is not eliminated and not one of the placed letters? Or it could be? But if it is one of the placed letters, then it would be a duplicate.

   But let's see: the placed letters are O, C, A, L. So if the first letter is one of these, it would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, the feedback system would account for duplicates? For example, if a letter appears twice, then the feedback would show '-' for the second occurrence if it is in the word but not at that position? But in our case, we have no duplicates in the feedback so far? 

   But to be safe, we should consider both possibilities? However, the problem does not restrict to distinct letters? So we must consider duplicates? But let's see the feedback for COMAL: we had C at 0 (got '-') and then O,A,L at 1,3,4 (got ✓). So if the secret word had two C's, then the C at 0 would be marked as '-' (which it was) and the other C would be at some position? But in our deduction, we placed C at 2? So if the secret word has C at 2, then that would be the only C? Or if it has two, then the first letter could be C? But wait, we have C at 0 in the guess and it was marked as not present at 0, but if the word had two C's, then the feedback would still show '-' for the C at 0? And then the other C at 2 would be marked as '-' or ✓? But in COMAL, we have no C at 2? We had M at 2? which was 'x'. So if the secret word had a C at 2, then in the guess COMAL, the C at 0 would be '-' and the C at 2? But we didn't have a C at 2? We had M at 2? So we don't know about position 2? 

   Actually, in COMAL, we only tested C at 0? So if the secret word has C at 2, then we wouldn't have any feedback for position 2? Because we didn't put a letter there that matches? We put M at 2? So the feedback for M was 'x', meaning M is not in the word? But that doesn't tell us about C at 2? 

   Therefore, we cannot deduce that C must be at 2? We only know that C is in the word and not at 0? It could be at 2? Or it could be at 1,3,4? But positions 1,3,4 are occupied by O,A,L? And they are fixed? So if C is at 1, that would be O's position? But O is fixed? Similarly, A at 3 and L at 4? So the only available position for C is index 2? Because if it were at 0, we know it's not? And 1,3,4 are taken? So it must be at 2? 

   Therefore, the word is: _ O C A L

   And the first letter is missing? And it must be a letter that is not eliminated and not one of O, C, A, L? Or it could be? But if it is one of these, then duplicate? 

   But let's list the eliminated letters: R, I, S, E, B, U, T, P, N, M.

   Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   And the word must be a valid English word.

   So we need a 5-letter word of the form [letter] O C A L.

   Now, what words fit? 

   Common words: 
     LOCAL? But L O C A L -> but we have L at the end? And we have L at the beginning? But in our pattern, the first letter is unknown, then O, C, A, L. So it would be ?OCAL.

   Examples: 
     FOCAL? F O C A L -> valid word? Yes, meaning relating to focus.
     VOCAL? V O C A L -> valid? Yes.
     DOCAL? Not a word? 
     HOCAL? Not a word?
     YOCAL? Not a word?
     SOCAL? But S is eliminated? Not allowed.

   So possible words: FOCAL, VOCAL.

   But we have to check if the letters are available? 
     F: not eliminated? Yes.
     V: not eliminated? Yes.

   Also, are there others? 
     ROCAL? R is eliminated? No.
     TOCAL? T eliminated? No.
     MOCAL? M eliminated? No.

   So only FOCAL and VOCAL? 

   But note: we have C in the word? And in FOCAL, we have F, O, C, A, L? So C is at 2? which matches? 

   Similarly for VOCAL.

   Now, we have two candidates? How to choose? We can guess one? 

   But note: we have one guess left? Actually, we have 6 guesses total? We have used 4? So we have 2 left? But we can try one? 

   However, we can also consider: is there any other constraint? 

   From the feedback, we know that in COMAL, C was at 0 and got '-', meaning C is in the word but not at 0. In FOCAL, C is at 2? So that would be correct? Similarly, in VOCAL, C at 2? 

   But we don't have any information about the first letter? 

   So we can guess FOCAL? 

   But let me check: if the word is FOCAL, then in COMAL, we had C at 0 (which is not in the word at 0? but in FOCAL, the first letter is F, so C at 0 is not present? But we got '-' for C in COMAL, meaning C is in the word? So if the word is FOCAL, then C is at 2? So the feedback for COMAL: 
     C at 0: present but not at 0 -> so '-' is correct? 
     O at 1: matches -> ✓
     M at 2: not in the word -> x (correct, because FOCAL has C at 2, not M)
     A at 3: matches -> ✓
     L at 4: matches -> ✓

   So it fits? 

   Similarly for VOCAL.

   Now, we need to choose one? 

   But note: we have not tested F or V? So we don't know which one? 

   We can guess FOCAL? 

   But to be safe? We have two possibilities? We can try to find a word that distinguishes? But we don't have enough information? 

   Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses one of them? 

   But we have to guess a word? 

   Since we have the pattern, we can guess FOCAL? 

   Or VOCAL? 

   But let's see the frequency? F is more common than V? But not sure? 

   We can also consider: in the first guess RAISE, we had no F or V? So no information? 

   So I think we have to pick one? 

   Let me pick FOCAL? 

   But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid? And it is? 

   Alternatively, we can think: is there a word with a different letter? 

   What about ""YOCAL""? Not a word? 

   Or ""GOCAL""? Not a word? 

   So only FOCAL and VOCAL? 

   Therefore, I'll guess FOCAL? 

   But let me check if there are others? 

   ""DOCAL""? Not a word? 
   ""HOCAL""? Not a word? 
   ""JOCAL""? Not a word? 
   ""KOCAL""? Not a word? 
   ""QOCAL""? Not a word? 
   ""WOCAL""? Not a word? 
   ""XOCAL""? Not a word? 
   ""YOCAL""? Not a word? 
   ""ZOCAL""? Not a word? 

   So only FOCAL and VOCAL? 

   I'll go with FOCAL? 

   But note: we have to output the guess? 

   So <guess>FOCAL</guess> 

   However, let me confirm the feedback we would get? 

   If the word is FOCAL, then we get all correct? 

   If the word is VOCAL, then for FOCAL: 
     F at 0: not in the word? Because VOCAL has V? So it would be 'x'? 
     Then O, C, A, L: all correct? So feedback: F(x) O(✓) C(✓) A(✓) L(✓)

   Then we know the first letter is V? 

   And we can guess VOCAL next? 

   But we have one more guess? 

   Alternatively, we can guess VOCAL now? 

   But we don't know? 

   Since we have two possibilities, and we have to choose, I'll go with FOCAL? 

   But let me see the previous feedback? 

   We have no information about F or V? 

   So it's 50-50? 

   But note: in the available letters, F and V are both available? 

   I think we have to pick one? 

   Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that can test both? But we don't have a pattern? 

   We have to guess one? 

   I'll choose FOCAL? 

   But let me see the frequency: F is more common? 

   Or V? 

   In 5-letter words ending with ""OCAL"", both are valid? 

   I think it's arbitrary? 

   So I'll go with FOCAL? 

   But note: the problem says we have 6 tries? We are on the 5th? 

   So if we are wrong, we can guess VOCAL next? 

   But let's output FOCAL? 

   However, the feedback from COMAL: we have C present but not at 0? And we deduced it must be at 2? So the word is ?OCAL? 

   And FOCAL and VOCAL are the only common words? 

   So I think it's safe to guess FOCAL? 

   Therefore, the guess is FOCAL.

### Analysis of Feedback and Current Constraints

1. **Feedback Summary**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R, I, S, E absent; A present but not at position 1.
   - **Guess 2 (ABOUT)**: B, U, T absent; A present but not at position 0; O present but not at position 2.
   - **Guess 3 (PLANO)**: P, N absent; L present but not at position 1; A present but not at position 2; O present but not at position 4.
   - **Guess 4 (COMAL)**: 
     - C present but not at position 0 (index 0).
     - O correct at position 1 (index 1).
     - M absent.
     - A correct at position 3 (index 3).
     - L correct at position 4 (index 4).

2. **Consolidated Insights**:
   - **Correctly Placed Letters**:
     - **O** at position 1 (index 1).
     - **A** at position 3 (index 3).
     - **L** at position 4 (index 4).
     - The word structure is: `_ O _ A L`.
   - **Confirmed Present Letters**:
     - **C** is in the word but not at position 0 (index 0).
   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, S, E, B, U, T, P, N, M.
   - **Available Letters** (not absent and not placed): D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

3. **Key Deductions**:
   - The word must be of the form `X O Y A L`, where:
     - **X** is the first letter (position 0), and **Y** is the third letter (position 2).
     - **C** must be placed at position 2 (index 2) because:
       - It cannot be at position 0 (feedback from COMAL).
       - Positions 1, 3, and 4 are occupied by O, A, L (fixed).
     - Thus, **Y = C**, and the word structure is `X O C A L`.
   - **X** must be a letter from the available set (D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) and form a valid English word.

4. **Possible Words**:
   - Valid English words fitting `X O C A L`:
     - **FOCAL** (relating to a focus).
     - **VOCAL** (relating to the voice).
   - Other combinations (e.g., DOCAL, GOCAL, HOCAL) are not valid English words.

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Goal**: Guess a valid word that fits `X O C A L` and tests the only unknown letter (X).
- **Options**: 
  - **FOCAL** and **VOCAL** are the only valid candidates.
  - Both words are common and fit all constraints.
- **Choice**: Prioritize **FOCAL** due to higher letter frequency (F is more common than V in English).

### Next Guess: FOCAL
- **Structure**: 
  - Position 0: **F** (tests the unknown first letter).
  - Position 1: **O** (confirmed correct).
  - Position 2: **C** (confirmed present and now placed at the deduced position).
  - Position 3: **A** (confirmed correct).
  - Position 4: **L** (confirmed correct).
- **Expected Outcomes**:
  - If **FOCAL** is correct, all positions will match (✓).
  - If **VOCAL** is the secret word, feedback will show:
    - F(x) (absent), O(✓), C(✓), A(✓), L(✓).
    - This would require a final guess of **VOCAL**.

<guess>FOCAL</guess>",FOCAL,"We have the following feedback history:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
  - R, I, S, E are not in the word.
  - A is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1).

Guess 2: ABOUT -> A(-) B(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)
  - B, U, T are not in the word.
  - A is in the word but not at position 0 (index 0).
  - O is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2).

Guess 3: PLANO -> P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) O(-)
  - P, N are not in the word.
  - L is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1).
  - A is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2).
  - O is in the word but not at position 4 (index 4).

Guess 4: COMAL -> C(-) O(✓) M(x) A(✓) L(✓)
  - C is in the word but not at position 0 (index 0).
  - O is correct at position 1 (index 1).
  - M is not in the word.
  - A is correct at position 3 (index 3).
  - L is correct at position 4 (index 4).

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. Correctly placed letters:
   - O is at position 1 (index 1).
   - A is at position 3 (index 3).
   - L is at position 4 (index 4).

   So the word has the form: _ O _ A L

2. Known absent letters: R, I, S, E, B, U, T, P, N, M.

3. Present letters but not in the correct position (from COMAL):
   - C is in the word but not at position 0.

4. We also know from previous guesses that:
   - A was previously misplaced at positions 0, 1, and 2, but now we know it's fixed at 3.
   - O was misplaced at positions 2 and 4, but now fixed at 1.
   - L was misplaced at position 1, but now fixed at 4.

5. The word must contain C (since we got '-' for C in COMAL, meaning it is present but not at index 0). Also, note that C is the only letter we know is present but not yet placed, and it cannot be at position 0.

6. The word has 5 letters, and we have 4 letters already placed: O at 1, A at 3, L at 4. The first letter (index 0) and the third letter (index 2) are missing. But note: the third letter is at index 2, which is the third position.

   Current known: 
     Position 0: unknown (but cannot be C, because C is present but not at 0? Actually, the feedback says C is not at 0, but it is in the word, so it must be at one of the other positions. However, positions 1, 3, and 4 are already taken by O, A, L. So the only remaining position is index 2 (the third letter). Therefore, C must be at position 2.

   But wait: the word is _ O _ A L, so the blanks are at index 0 and index 2.

   We know C is in the word and not at 0, so it must be at index 2? Because positions 1,3,4 are occupied by O,A,L and are fixed. So the only possibility for C is at index 2.

   However, we must confirm: the feedback for COMAL had C at index 0 and got '-', meaning C is in the word but not at 0. Since the other positions (1,3,4) are taken by O,A,L (which are fixed and different from C), then C must be at the only remaining position: index 2.

   Therefore, the word must be: _ O C A L

   Now, we only need to find the first letter (index 0). It must be a letter that is not in the eliminated list and not C (because C is at index 2), and not O,A,L (which are already placed).

   Eliminated letters: R,I,S,E,B,U,T,P,N,M.

   Available letters: the alphabet minus eliminated and minus the placed letters (O,A,L,C) but note C is placed at 2, so we don't use it again? The first letter must be a new letter? Or it could be a duplicate? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

   However, the feedback has not shown any duplicates, and we have no reason to assume duplicates. So we assume distinct letters? But the problem doesn't say the word has distinct letters, so duplicates are possible? But in this case, we have C at index 2, and the first letter must be a letter that is not eliminated and not one of the placed letters? Or it could be? But if it is one of the placed letters, then it would be a duplicate.

   But let's see: the placed letters are O, C, A, L. So if the first letter is one of these, it would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, the feedback system would account for duplicates? For example, if a letter appears twice, then the feedback would show '-' for the second occurrence if it is in the word but not at that position? But in our case, we have no duplicates in the feedback so far? 

   But to be safe, we should consider both possibilities? However, the problem does not restrict to distinct letters? So we must consider duplicates? But let's see the feedback for COMAL: we had C at 0 (got '-') and then O,A,L at 1,3,4 (got ✓). So if the secret word had two C's, then the C at 0 would be marked as '-' (which it was) and the other C would be at some position? But in our deduction, we placed C at 2? So if the secret word has C at 2, then that would be the only C? Or if it has two, then the first letter could be C? But wait, we have C at 0 in the guess and it was marked as not present at 0, but if the word had two C's, then the feedback would still show '-' for the C at 0? And then the other C at 2 would be marked as '-' or ✓? But in COMAL, we have no C at 2? We had M at 2? which was 'x'. So if the secret word had a C at 2, then in the guess COMAL, the C at 0 would be '-' and the C at 2? But we didn't have a C at 2? We had M at 2? So we don't know about position 2? 

   Actually, in COMAL, we only tested C at 0? So if the secret word has C at 2, then we wouldn't have any feedback for position 2? Because we didn't put a letter there that matches? We put M at 2? So the feedback for M was 'x', meaning M is not in the word? But that doesn't tell us about C at 2? 

   Therefore, we cannot deduce that C must be at 2? We only know that C is in the word and not at 0? It could be at 2? Or it could be at 1,3,4? But positions 1,3,4 are occupied by O,A,L? And they are fixed? So if C is at 1, that would be O's position? But O is fixed? Similarly, A at 3 and L at 4? So the only available position for C is index 2? Because if it were at 0, we know it's not? And 1,3,4 are taken? So it must be at 2? 

   Therefore, the word is: _ O C A L

   And the first letter is missing? And it must be a letter that is not eliminated and not one of O, C, A, L? Or it could be? But if it is one of these, then duplicate? 

   But let's list the eliminated letters: R, I, S, E, B, U, T, P, N, M.

   Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   And the word must be a valid English word.

   So we need a 5-letter word of the form [letter] O C A L.

   Now, what words fit? 

   Common words: 
     LOCAL? But L O C A L -> but we have L at the end? And we have L at the beginning? But in our pattern, the first letter is unknown, then O, C, A, L. So it would be ?OCAL.

   Examples: 
     FOCAL? F O C A L -> valid word? Yes, meaning relating to focus.
     VOCAL? V O C A L -> valid? Yes.
     DOCAL? Not a word? 
     HOCAL? Not a word?
     YOCAL? Not a word?
     SOCAL? But S is eliminated? Not allowed.

   So possible words: FOCAL, VOCAL.

   But we have to check if the letters are available? 
     F: not eliminated? Yes.
     V: not eliminated? Yes.

   Also, are there others? 
     ROCAL? R is eliminated? No.
     TOCAL? T eliminated? No.
     MOCAL? M eliminated? No.

   So only FOCAL and VOCAL? 

   But note: we have C in the word? And in FOCAL, we have F, O, C, A, L? So C is at 2? which matches? 

   Similarly for VOCAL.

   Now, we have two candidates? How to choose? We can guess one? 

   But note: we have one guess left? Actually, we have 6 guesses total? We have used 4? So we have 2 left? But we can try one? 

   However, we can also consider: is there any other constraint? 

   From the feedback, we know that in COMAL, C was at 0 and got '-', meaning C is in the word but not at 0. In FOCAL, C is at 2? So that would be correct? Similarly, in VOCAL, C at 2? 

   But we don't have any information about the first letter? 

   So we can guess FOCAL? 

   But let me check: if the word is FOCAL, then in COMAL, we had C at 0 (which is not in the word at 0? but in FOCAL, the first letter is F, so C at 0 is not present? But we got '-' for C in COMAL, meaning C is in the word? So if the word is FOCAL, then C is at 2? So the feedback for COMAL: 
     C at 0: present but not at 0 -> so '-' is correct? 
     O at 1: matches -> ✓
     M at 2: not in the word -> x (correct, because FOCAL has C at 2, not M)
     A at 3: matches -> ✓
     L at 4: matches -> ✓

   So it fits? 

   Similarly for VOCAL.

   Now, we need to choose one? 

   But note: we have not tested F or V? So we don't know which one? 

   We can guess FOCAL? 

   But to be safe? We have two possibilities? We can try to find a word that distinguishes? But we don't have enough information? 

   Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses one of them? 

   But we have to guess a word? 

   Since we have the pattern, we can guess FOCAL? 

   Or VOCAL? 

   But let's see the frequency? F is more common than V? But not sure? 

   We can also consider: in the first guess RAISE, we had no F or V? So no information? 

   So I think we have to pick one? 

   Let me pick FOCAL? 

   But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid? And it is? 

   Alternatively, we can think: is there a word with a different letter? 

   What about ""YOCAL""? Not a word? 

   Or ""GOCAL""? Not a word? 

   So only FOCAL and VOCAL? 

   Therefore, I'll guess FOCAL? 

   But let me check if there are others? 

   ""DOCAL""? Not a word? 
   ""HOCAL""? Not a word? 
   ""JOCAL""? Not a word? 
   ""KOCAL""? Not a word? 
   ""QOCAL""? Not a word? 
   ""WOCAL""? Not a word? 
   ""XOCAL""? Not a word? 
   ""YOCAL""? Not a word? 
   ""ZOCAL""? Not a word? 

   So only FOCAL and VOCAL? 

   I'll go with FOCAL? 

   But note: we have to output the guess? 

   So <guess>FOCAL</guess> 

   However, let me confirm the feedback we would get? 

   If the word is FOCAL, then we get all correct? 

   If the word is VOCAL, then for FOCAL: 
     F at 0: not in the word? Because VOCAL has V? So it would be 'x'? 
     Then O, C, A, L: all correct? So feedback: F(x) O(✓) C(✓) A(✓) L(✓)

   Then we know the first letter is V? 

   And we can guess VOCAL next? 

   But we have one more guess? 

   Alternatively, we can guess VOCAL now? 

   But we don't know? 

   Since we have two possibilities, and we have to choose, I'll go with FOCAL? 

   But let me see the previous feedback? 

   We have no information about F or V? 

   So it's 50-50? 

   But note: in the available letters, F and V are both available? 

   I think we have to pick one? 

   Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that can test both? But we don't have a pattern? 

   We have to guess one? 

   I'll choose FOCAL? 

   But let me see the frequency: F is more common? 

   Or V? 

   In 5-letter words ending with ""OCAL"", both are valid? 

   I think it's arbitrary? 

   So I'll go with FOCAL? 

   But note: the problem says we have 6 tries? We are on the 5th? 

   So if we are wrong, we can guess VOCAL next? 

   But let's output FOCAL? 

   However, the feedback from COMAL: we have C present but not at 0? And we deduced it must be at 2? So the word is ?OCAL? 

   And FOCAL and VOCAL are the only common words? 

   So I think it's safe to guess FOCAL? 

   Therefore, the guess is FOCAL.### Analysis of Feedback and Current Constraints

1. **Feedback Summary**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R, I, S, E absent; A present but not at position 1.
   - **Guess 2 (ABOUT)**: B, U, T absent; A present but not at position 0; O present but not at position 2.
   - **Guess 3 (PLANO)**: P, N absent; L present but not at position 1; A present but not at position 2; O present but not at position 4.
   - **Guess 4 (COMAL)**: 
     - C present but not at position 0 (index 0).
     - O correct at position 1 (index 1).
     - M absent.
     - A correct at position 3 (index 3).
     - L correct at position 4 (index 4).

2. **Consolidated Insights**:
   - **Correctly Placed Letters**:
     - **O** at position 1 (index 1).
     - **A** at position 3 (index 3).
     - **L** at position 4 (index 4).
     - The word structure is: `_ O _ A L`.
   - **Confirmed Present Letters**:
     - **C** is in the word but not at position 0 (index 0).
   - **Absent Letters**: R, I, S, E, B, U, T, P, N, M.
   - **Available Letters** (not absent and not placed): D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

3. **Key Deductions**:
   - The word must be of the form `X O Y A L`, where:
     - **X** is the first letter (position 0), and **Y** is the third letter (position 2).
     - **C** must be placed at position 2 (index 2) because:
       - It cannot be at position 0 (feedback from COMAL).
       - Positions 1, 3, and 4 are occupied by O, A, L (fixed).
     - Thus, **Y = C**, and the word structure is `X O C A L`.
   - **X** must be a letter from the available set (D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) and form a valid English word.

4. **Possible Words**:
   - Valid English words fitting `X O C A L`:
     - **FOCAL** (relating to a focus).
     - **VOCAL** (relating to the voice).
   - Other combinations (e.g., DOCAL, GOCAL, HOCAL) are not valid English words.

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Goal**: Guess a valid word that fits `X O C A L` and tests the only unknown letter (X).
- **Options**: 
  - **FOCAL** and **VOCAL** are the only valid candidates.
  - Both words are common and fit all constraints.
- **Choice**: Prioritize **FOCAL** due to higher letter frequency (F is more common than V in English).

### Next Guess: FOCAL
- **Structure**: 
  - Position 0: **F** (tests the unknown first letter).
  - Position 1: **O** (confirmed correct).
  - Position 2: **C** (confirmed present and now placed at the deduced position).
  - Position 3: **A** (confirmed correct).
  - Position 4: **L** (confirmed correct).
- **Expected Outcomes**:
  - If **FOCAL** is correct, all positions will match (✓).
  - If **VOCAL** is the secret word, feedback will show:
    - F(x) (absent), O(✓), C(✓), A(✓), L(✓).
    - This would require a final guess of **VOCAL**.",Guess 5: FOCAL -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) O(✓) C(✓) A(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
