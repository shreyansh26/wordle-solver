We have the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C: x → not in the word
- R: - → R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed R as the second letter and it's wrong position)
- A: ✓ → A is in the word and in the correct position (third position, since we guessed A as the third letter)
- T: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

We know:
- A is present and in the third position (so the secret word has A as the third letter: _ _ A _ _)
- R is present but not in the second position (so R is either in the first, fourth, or fifth position)
- C, T, E are not in the word at all.

Now, we need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

Our new guess must:
- Not contain C, T, E (since they are absent)
- Include R (because R is in the word, but not in the second position)
- Have A in the third position.

We should try to test other common letters and positions.

Possible positions for R: It cannot be in the second position, so it must be in 1st, 4th, or 5th. We haven't tested the first, fourth, or fifth positions yet.

We also know that the word has A in the third position, so the pattern is: _ _ A _ _

Let's think of words that fit:
- Must have A in the third slot.
- Must include R, but not in the second slot (so R in 1st, 4th, or 5th).
- Avoid C, T, E.

We want to maximize information by covering new letters and different positions.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know the second position should not be R, and we have no information about other positions.

Let me come up with a word that has:
- A in the third position.
- R in either 1st, 4th, or 5th.
- And uses other letters that are common.

Since R is misplaced, we should avoid putting R in the second slot again, but we already know second slot is wrong for R.

Possible words:
- If R is first: R _ A _ _ 
  - Examples: ""ROAST"", but we have S and T? T is absent so ""ROAST"" has T which is bad. No T or E or C.
  - ""RADAR"": has R in first and fifth, A in third, and D and R. But D is new. However, note that R is already known to be in the word, but we might get duplicate R? The feedback doesn't tell about duplicates? Actually, the feedback might reveal duplicates if present.

But note: In our first guess, ""crate"" had one R and we got a minus for R. It doesn't say how many R. So the word might have more than one R? We don't know.

But in ""crate"", we had R only once. If the secret word has two R's, then we might have gotten two minuses? Or only one if the second one is not matched? But in Wordle rules, if a letter appears multiple times, it gets feedback based on how many are in the word.

Important: The feedback is per letter, but we don't know the counts from the feedback alone. However, if we guess a word with multiple same letters, and the secret has duplicates, it can be tricky.

But our first guess had only one R. So we know R is at least once in the word.

Back to word choice.

Words with A in third position and R somewhere else:

- Option: ""BRAVE"" → but we have E? E is absent. Rejected.

- ""DRAWL"": has A in third? D-R-A-W-L → A is third? D(1), R(2), A(3), W(4), L(5). But remember, R was misplaced in the second position? We guessed R in second and got minus, meaning R is not in second position. So in ""DRAWL"", we put R in the second position again? That would give us the same error. So we cannot put R in the second position because we know it's wrong.

Therefore, we must avoid using R in the second position in the new guess.

So for ""R _ A _ _"", we can put R in first? Then second position could be something else.

Examples:
- ""GRAPH"": has A in third? G-R-A-P-H → A is fourth? No, G(1), R(2), A(3)? Actually, positions are: 1: G, 2: R, 3: A? But we are putting R in second position, which is forbidden because we've established R is not in second position. So ""GRAPH"" puts R in second → bad.

We must avoid second position for R.

So if we want R in the word, and avoid second position, then options:
- Position 1: R
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: R

Therefore, we can structure as:

Option 1: R _ A _ _
But second slot cannot be R, so it can be something else. Example: ""ROBIN""? But A in third? R-O-B-I-N? Third letter is B → no. Not A in third.

We need A in third: so for first word, it has to be _ _ A _ _

With R in a different slot.

How about:
- First slot R: R ? A ? ? → with ? avoiding known absent letters.
- Second slot not R, and we'll put a new letter we haven't tried.
- Fourth slot?
- Fifth slot?

Example words:
- ""RAYON"": R-A-Y-O-N? That doesn't have A in third. Positions: R(1), A(2), ... → A is in second? Third is Y? No.

We must have A in third: so the pattern is letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.

Therefore, if R is in first position: the word is R ? A ? ? → R _ A _ _

Examples: ""RAMAN"", but not common. ""RABAT""? Too obscure.

Common words: ""RADAR"" → but T in it? No. R-A-D-A-R? Positions: 
- 1: R
- 2: A → but we need A at position 3? Here A is at position 2? So no. For ""RADAR"", the word is R(1), A(2), D(3), A(4), R(5) → so third letter is D, not A → does not have A at third? Therefore wrong pattern.

Need A at third: so only letters where second letter isn't A? Actually, A is fixed at third. So let’s list words ending with A at third.

Better to think: words with third letter A. Example: ""LLAMA""? But we don't want repeated or obscure?

""MANGA""? But let's avoid duplicates for now.

More common: ""PIANO"" → but P-I-A-N-O? A is third? Yes! Positions: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5). Now, we need to include R? But ""PIANO"" has no R. We must include R to test for its presence.

Since R is in the word, we must have R in the new guess to find its position.

But we don't necessarily have to include R in the new guess? Actually, we can guess a word without R and if we get it, then R might be revealed? But the feedback will tell us about the letters. However, it's better to include R to pin the position.

Alternative: we can use a word that has R in a new position (like first) and also tests other consonants.

But we must avoid E, T, C? And also, we know the third letter is A.

Possible: ""PARIS"" → P-A-R-I-S? Third letter R? But we need A in third? Here, third letter R → no. A is second? Not third.

Must be exactly third letter A.

Another: ""BASIC"" → has C? C is absent. And B-A-S-I-C? Third is S? Second is A? No pattern: B(1)=B, B(2)=A, B(3)=S? A is second? No.

What about: ""PLAIT"" → P-L-A-I-T? Third letter A? Yes: P(1)=P, L(2)=L, A(3)=A, I(4)=I, T(5)=T? But T is absent? And E? T is absent so we cannot use T.

Absent letters: C, T, E. Must avoid them.

So with A in third and no C, T, E.

Word: ""MANOR"" → M-A-N-O-R? Third letter N? Not A → no: position1=M,2=A,3=N,4=O,5=R? So second is A, third is N? Doesn't have A at third? In this, A is at second? Not third.

We need pattern: ? ? A ? ?

So for ""MANOR"", it has A in second? That's not the third.

What about: ""FLAIR"" → F-L-A-I-R? Positions: F(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). Perfect! Third letter A. Letters involved: F, L, A, I, R.

Avoided C, T, E? Yes.

R is in the fifth position? That's good, because we know R is present but not in second position. Now fifth position is new.

Additionally, we test F, L, and I? All new.

So let's consider ""FLAIR"" as a candidate.

But we also need to check if it's a valid word? Yes, flair is a valid English word.

Other options?

""BRAID"" → B-R-A-I-D? Third letter A? Positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). But here, R is in the second position! We know from previous feedback that R is not in the second position. So if we guess ""BRAID"", putting R in second, we might get a minus again? Actually, we already know R is misplaced in second, so it shouldn't be placed there again. So ""BRAID"" would waste the R position and we know it's wrong.

Therefore, ""BRAID"" is not a good choice because it puts R in a known wrong position.

Similarly, ""GRASP"" → G-R-A-S-P? R in second? Again, same issue.

""OPERATION"" is 8 letters? No.

Shorter: ""ABOUT"" → A-B-O-U-T? Third letter O? Not A → no.

""ADAPT"" → A-D-A-P-T? Third letter A? Positions: A(1), D(2), A(3), P(4), T(5). But T is absent? And D and P new. But also, T is absent so we can't use T. So ""ADAPT"" has T? T is absent → rejected.

Back to ""FLAIR"": F-L-A-I-R → letters: F, L, A, I, R; no forbidden letters and A at third.

Another word: ""PLAIN"" → has no R? But we need to test R? Not necessarily, but we should include R to locate it.

Since R must be in 1,4, or 5 positions, we should try to cover one of those.

In ""FLAIR"":
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: A (correct as we know)
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: R

So we have R in position 5? That might be one candidate location.

Another choice: ""RAINS"" → R-A-I-N-S? Third letter I? Not A → no: position1=R,2=A,3=I? That's not A at third; A is at second.

Need A at third? Exactly third.

How about ""SALAD""? S-A-L-A-D? Third letter L? Not A → positions: S1, A2, L3, A4, D5? So A at 2 and 4? But third is L? Not A.

""MARKS""? M-A-R-K-S? Third letter R? Not A → no.

""WHEAT""? Has E? E absent? And W-H-E-A-T? Third letter E? Also E is absent → bad.

Better word: ""CLAIM""? But C is absent? We can't use C.

""AVAIL""? A-V-A-I-L? Third letter A? Positions: A1, V2, A3, I4, L5. But A1 and A3? Third letter is A. But also, A is already known to be in third, so we're covering. However, we need R? No R.

But we must include R? Not mandatory, but if we don't, we don't get info on R position.

So perhaps ""AVAIL"" is not good because it misses R.

Ideal: cover R in a new position and introduce new letters.

Another word: ""CARAT"" → C is absent? And T absent? Rejected.

""GUARD""? G-U-A-R-D? Third letter A? Positions: G1, U2, A3, R4, D5? Perfect! Third letter A, and R is in the fourth position? Which is new. Letters: G, U, A, R, D? Avoid forbidden? Yes: no C, T, E.

But G-U-A-R-D is ""GUARD""? Yes, guard is a valid word.

Also, ""FLAIR"" we considered earlier.

Now, which one is better between ""FLAIR"" and ""GUARD""?

In ""FLAIR"": letters: F, L, A, I, R
In ""GUARD"": letters: G, U, A, R, D

Both have A at third and R in a new position (R at fifth in flair and fourth in guard).

We also want to avoid reusing incorrect positions? We don't know positions for letters other than A.

But in first guess, we tested positions:
- Pos1: C (absent)
- Pos2: R (wrong position)
- Pos3: A (correct)
- Pos4: T (absent)
- Pos5: E (absent)

So positions 1,4,5 are still unknown? Yes.

In ""FLAIR"":
- Pos1: F (we test position 1 with F)
- Pos2: L (test position 2 with L)
- Pos3: A (known, so will be ✓)
- Pos4: I (test position 4 with I)
- Pos5: R (test position 5 with R)

Similarly in ""GUARD"":
- Pos1: G
- Pos2: U
- Pos3: A
- Pos4: R (test position 4 with R)
- Pos5: D

We know R is present but not in pos2, so putting R in pos4 might reveal it.

""FLAIR"" tests positions 1,2,4,5? Yes.

Both good? We should pick one.

Perhaps ""GUARD"" duplicates R? No, guard has one R.

But let's count letters: FLAIR has unique letters? F,L,A,I,R all distinct.

GUARD has G,U,A,R,D → distinct.

But note: in the secret word, we have R and no C,T,E.

Another point: which common letters? Let's see frequency.

We might also consider ""DRAIN""? But D-R-A-I-N? Positions: D(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). But R is in second position? We know R is not in second, so we should not put R in second again? Yes! So ""DRAIN"" would put R in second, which is wrong position? So it would give minus, but we already know that? So it doesn't help? We should avoid.

Therefore, ""DRAIN"" is not good.

So back to choices: FLAIR or GUARD.

I think either is fine.

But to decide: ""GUARD"" introduces U and D? U is less common? Perhaps ""FLAIR"" has more common letters: F, L, I might be better.

Since we have only 6 tries, let's choose ""FLAIR"".

Another word: ""PARAD"": not common? Better stick to common words.

So I'll go with ""FLAIR"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- **Feedback interpretation**: 
  - C not in word → eliminate C (cannot use).
  - R is in the word but not in position 2 → we must include R in positions 1, 4, or 5.
  - A is correct and in position 3 → third letter must be A.
  - T and E not in word → eliminate T and E (cannot use).
- Updated constraints: Secret word pattern is `_ _ A _ _`, with R present (but not in position 2), and excludes C, E, T.
- Strategy for second guess: 
  - Must include R in positions 1, 4, or 5 to test its location.
  - Avoid using R in position 2 (known wrong).
  - Introduce new high-frequency consonant/l vowel letters to maximize information: tested F, L, I, while avoiding forbidden letters.
  - Selected ""FLAIR"":
    - Fits pattern `F L A I R` → A is in position 3 (correct).
    - R is placed in position 5 (one allowed untested position).
    - Tests new letters F, L, I in positions 1, 2, and 4.
    - Uses common English word.

<guess>flair</guess>",flair,"We have the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C: x → not in the word
- R: - → R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed R as the second letter and it's wrong position)
- A: ✓ → A is in the word and in the correct position (third position, since we guessed A as the third letter)
- T: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

We know:
- A is present and in the third position (so the secret word has A as the third letter: _ _ A _ _)
- R is present but not in the second position (so R is either in the first, fourth, or fifth position)
- C, T, E are not in the word at all.

Now, we need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

Our new guess must:
- Not contain C, T, E (since they are absent)
- Include R (because R is in the word, but not in the second position)
- Have A in the third position.

We should try to test other common letters and positions.

Possible positions for R: It cannot be in the second position, so it must be in 1st, 4th, or 5th. We haven't tested the first, fourth, or fifth positions yet.

We also know that the word has A in the third position, so the pattern is: _ _ A _ _

Let's think of words that fit:
- Must have A in the third slot.
- Must include R, but not in the second slot (so R in 1st, 4th, or 5th).
- Avoid C, T, E.

We want to maximize information by covering new letters and different positions.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know the second position should not be R, and we have no information about other positions.

Let me come up with a word that has:
- A in the third position.
- R in either 1st, 4th, or 5th.
- And uses other letters that are common.

Since R is misplaced, we should avoid putting R in the second slot again, but we already know second slot is wrong for R.

Possible words:
- If R is first: R _ A _ _ 
  - Examples: ""ROAST"", but we have S and T? T is absent so ""ROAST"" has T which is bad. No T or E or C.
  - ""RADAR"": has R in first and fifth, A in third, and D and R. But D is new. However, note that R is already known to be in the word, but we might get duplicate R? The feedback doesn't tell about duplicates? Actually, the feedback might reveal duplicates if present.

But note: In our first guess, ""crate"" had one R and we got a minus for R. It doesn't say how many R. So the word might have more than one R? We don't know.

But in ""crate"", we had R only once. If the secret word has two R's, then we might have gotten two minuses? Or only one if the second one is not matched? But in Wordle rules, if a letter appears multiple times, it gets feedback based on how many are in the word.

Important: The feedback is per letter, but we don't know the counts from the feedback alone. However, if we guess a word with multiple same letters, and the secret has duplicates, it can be tricky.

But our first guess had only one R. So we know R is at least once in the word.

Back to word choice.

Words with A in third position and R somewhere else:

- Option: ""BRAVE"" → but we have E? E is absent. Rejected.

- ""DRAWL"": has A in third? D-R-A-W-L → A is third? D(1), R(2), A(3), W(4), L(5). But remember, R was misplaced in the second position? We guessed R in second and got minus, meaning R is not in second position. So in ""DRAWL"", we put R in the second position again? That would give us the same error. So we cannot put R in the second position because we know it's wrong.

Therefore, we must avoid using R in the second position in the new guess.

So for ""R _ A _ _"", we can put R in first? Then second position could be something else.

Examples:
- ""GRAPH"": has A in third? G-R-A-P-H → A is fourth? No, G(1), R(2), A(3)? Actually, positions are: 1: G, 2: R, 3: A? But we are putting R in second position, which is forbidden because we've established R is not in second position. So ""GRAPH"" puts R in second → bad.

We must avoid second position for R.

So if we want R in the word, and avoid second position, then options:
- Position 1: R
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: R

Therefore, we can structure as:

Option 1: R _ A _ _
But second slot cannot be R, so it can be something else. Example: ""ROBIN""? But A in third? R-O-B-I-N? Third letter is B → no. Not A in third.

We need A in third: so for first word, it has to be _ _ A _ _

With R in a different slot.

How about:
- First slot R: R ? A ? ? → with ? avoiding known absent letters.
- Second slot not R, and we'll put a new letter we haven't tried.
- Fourth slot?
- Fifth slot?

Example words:
- ""RAYON"": R-A-Y-O-N? That doesn't have A in third. Positions: R(1), A(2), ... → A is in second? Third is Y? No.

We must have A in third: so the pattern is letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.

Therefore, if R is in first position: the word is R ? A ? ? → R _ A _ _

Examples: ""RAMAN"", but not common. ""RABAT""? Too obscure.

Common words: ""RADAR"" → but T in it? No. R-A-D-A-R? Positions: 
- 1: R
- 2: A → but we need A at position 3? Here A is at position 2? So no. For ""RADAR"", the word is R(1), A(2), D(3), A(4), R(5) → so third letter is D, not A → does not have A at third? Therefore wrong pattern.

Need A at third: so only letters where second letter isn't A? Actually, A is fixed at third. So let’s list words ending with A at third.

Better to think: words with third letter A. Example: ""LLAMA""? But we don't want repeated or obscure?

""MANGA""? But let's avoid duplicates for now.

More common: ""PIANO"" → but P-I-A-N-O? A is third? Yes! Positions: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5). Now, we need to include R? But ""PIANO"" has no R. We must include R to test for its presence.

Since R is in the word, we must have R in the new guess to find its position.

But we don't necessarily have to include R in the new guess? Actually, we can guess a word without R and if we get it, then R might be revealed? But the feedback will tell us about the letters. However, it's better to include R to pin the position.

Alternative: we can use a word that has R in a new position (like first) and also tests other consonants.

But we must avoid E, T, C? And also, we know the third letter is A.

Possible: ""PARIS"" → P-A-R-I-S? Third letter R? But we need A in third? Here, third letter R → no. A is second? Not third.

Must be exactly third letter A.

Another: ""BASIC"" → has C? C is absent. And B-A-S-I-C? Third is S? Second is A? No pattern: B(1)=B, B(2)=A, B(3)=S? A is second? No.

What about: ""PLAIT"" → P-L-A-I-T? Third letter A? Yes: P(1)=P, L(2)=L, A(3)=A, I(4)=I, T(5)=T? But T is absent? And E? T is absent so we cannot use T.

Absent letters: C, T, E. Must avoid them.

So with A in third and no C, T, E.

Word: ""MANOR"" → M-A-N-O-R? Third letter N? Not A → no: position1=M,2=A,3=N,4=O,5=R? So second is A, third is N? Doesn't have A at third? In this, A is at second? Not third.

We need pattern: ? ? A ? ?

So for ""MANOR"", it has A in second? That's not the third.

What about: ""FLAIR"" → F-L-A-I-R? Positions: F(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). Perfect! Third letter A. Letters involved: F, L, A, I, R.

Avoided C, T, E? Yes.

R is in the fifth position? That's good, because we know R is present but not in second position. Now fifth position is new.

Additionally, we test F, L, and I? All new.

So let's consider ""FLAIR"" as a candidate.

But we also need to check if it's a valid word? Yes, flair is a valid English word.

Other options?

""BRAID"" → B-R-A-I-D? Third letter A? Positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). But here, R is in the second position! We know from previous feedback that R is not in the second position. So if we guess ""BRAID"", putting R in second, we might get a minus again? Actually, we already know R is misplaced in second, so it shouldn't be placed there again. So ""BRAID"" would waste the R position and we know it's wrong.

Therefore, ""BRAID"" is not a good choice because it puts R in a known wrong position.

Similarly, ""GRASP"" → G-R-A-S-P? R in second? Again, same issue.

""OPERATION"" is 8 letters? No.

Shorter: ""ABOUT"" → A-B-O-U-T? Third letter O? Not A → no.

""ADAPT"" → A-D-A-P-T? Third letter A? Positions: A(1), D(2), A(3), P(4), T(5). But T is absent? And D and P new. But also, T is absent so we can't use T. So ""ADAPT"" has T? T is absent → rejected.

Back to ""FLAIR"": F-L-A-I-R → letters: F, L, A, I, R; no forbidden letters and A at third.

Another word: ""PLAIN"" → has no R? But we need to test R? Not necessarily, but we should include R to locate it.

Since R must be in 1,4, or 5 positions, we should try to cover one of those.

In ""FLAIR"":
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: A (correct as we know)
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: R

So we have R in position 5? That might be one candidate location.

Another choice: ""RAINS"" → R-A-I-N-S? Third letter I? Not A → no: position1=R,2=A,3=I? That's not A at third; A is at second.

Need A at third? Exactly third.

How about ""SALAD""? S-A-L-A-D? Third letter L? Not A → positions: S1, A2, L3, A4, D5? So A at 2 and 4? But third is L? Not A.

""MARKS""? M-A-R-K-S? Third letter R? Not A → no.

""WHEAT""? Has E? E absent? And W-H-E-A-T? Third letter E? Also E is absent → bad.

Better word: ""CLAIM""? But C is absent? We can't use C.

""AVAIL""? A-V-A-I-L? Third letter A? Positions: A1, V2, A3, I4, L5. But A1 and A3? Third letter is A. But also, A is already known to be in third, so we're covering. However, we need R? No R.

But we must include R? Not mandatory, but if we don't, we don't get info on R position.

So perhaps ""AVAIL"" is not good because it misses R.

Ideal: cover R in a new position and introduce new letters.

Another word: ""CARAT"" → C is absent? And T absent? Rejected.

""GUARD""? G-U-A-R-D? Third letter A? Positions: G1, U2, A3, R4, D5? Perfect! Third letter A, and R is in the fourth position? Which is new. Letters: G, U, A, R, D? Avoid forbidden? Yes: no C, T, E.

But G-U-A-R-D is ""GUARD""? Yes, guard is a valid word.

Also, ""FLAIR"" we considered earlier.

Now, which one is better between ""FLAIR"" and ""GUARD""?

In ""FLAIR"": letters: F, L, A, I, R
In ""GUARD"": letters: G, U, A, R, D

Both have A at third and R in a new position (R at fifth in flair and fourth in guard).

We also want to avoid reusing incorrect positions? We don't know positions for letters other than A.

But in first guess, we tested positions:
- Pos1: C (absent)
- Pos2: R (wrong position)
- Pos3: A (correct)
- Pos4: T (absent)
- Pos5: E (absent)

So positions 1,4,5 are still unknown? Yes.

In ""FLAIR"":
- Pos1: F (we test position 1 with F)
- Pos2: L (test position 2 with L)
- Pos3: A (known, so will be ✓)
- Pos4: I (test position 4 with I)
- Pos5: R (test position 5 with R)

Similarly in ""GUARD"":
- Pos1: G
- Pos2: U
- Pos3: A
- Pos4: R (test position 4 with R)
- Pos5: D

We know R is present but not in pos2, so putting R in pos4 might reveal it.

""FLAIR"" tests positions 1,2,4,5? Yes.

Both good? We should pick one.

Perhaps ""GUARD"" duplicates R? No, guard has one R.

But let's count letters: FLAIR has unique letters? F,L,A,I,R all distinct.

GUARD has G,U,A,R,D → distinct.

But note: in the secret word, we have R and no C,T,E.

Another point: which common letters? Let's see frequency.

We might also consider ""DRAIN""? But D-R-A-I-N? Positions: D(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). But R is in second position? We know R is not in second, so we should not put R in second again? Yes! So ""DRAIN"" would put R in second, which is wrong position? So it would give minus, but we already know that? So it doesn't help? We should avoid.

Therefore, ""DRAIN"" is not good.

So back to choices: FLAIR or GUARD.

I think either is fine.

But to decide: ""GUARD"" introduces U and D? U is less common? Perhaps ""FLAIR"" has more common letters: F, L, I might be better.

Since we have only 6 tries, let's choose ""FLAIR"".

Another word: ""PARAD"": not common? Better stick to common words.

So I'll go with ""FLAIR"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- **Feedback interpretation**: 
  - C not in word → eliminate C (cannot use).
  - R is in the word but not in position 2 → we must include R in positions 1, 4, or 5.
  - A is correct and in position 3 → third letter must be A.
  - T and E not in word → eliminate T and E (cannot use).
- Updated constraints: Secret word pattern is `_ _ A _ _`, with R present (but not in position 2), and excludes C, E, T.
- Strategy for second guess: 
  - Must include R in positions 1, 4, or 5 to test its location.
  - Avoid using R in position 2 (known wrong).
  - Introduce new high-frequency consonant/l vowel letters to maximize information: tested F, L, I, while avoiding forbidden letters.
  - Selected ""FLAIR"":
    - Fits pattern `F L A I R` → A is in position 3 (correct).
    - R is placed in position 5 (one allowed untested position).
    - Tests new letters F, L, I in positions 1, 2, and 4.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,SNARL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game and need to make our first guess. The goal is to choose a word that maximizes the information gained, such as covering common letters and positions.
 Common starting words often include a mix of vowels and common consonants. A popular choice is ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". For diversity, let me think of one.
 After considering, I'll go with ""CRATE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, T, E. Also, it avoids repeating letters.

<guess>crate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- C: x → not in the word
- R: - → R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed R as the second letter and it's wrong position)
- A: ✓ → A is in the word and in the correct position (third position, since we guessed A as the third letter)
- T: x → not in the word
- E: x → not in the word

We know:
- A is present and in the third position (so the secret word has A as the third letter: _ _ A _ _)
- R is present but not in the second position (so R is either in the first, fourth, or fifth position)
- C, T, E are not in the word at all.

Now, we need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

Our new guess must:
- Not contain C, T, E (since they are absent)
- Include R (because R is in the word, but not in the second position)
- Have A in the third position.

We should try to test other common letters and positions.

Possible positions for R: It cannot be in the second position, so it must be in 1st, 4th, or 5th. We haven't tested the first, fourth, or fifth positions yet.

We also know that the word has A in the third position, so the pattern is: _ _ A _ _

Let's think of words that fit:
- Must have A in the third slot.
- Must include R, but not in the second slot (so R in 1st, 4th, or 5th).
- Avoid C, T, E.

We want to maximize information by covering new letters and different positions.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know the second position should not be R, and we have no information about other positions.

Let me come up with a word that has:
- A in the third position.
- R in either 1st, 4th, or 5th.
- And uses other letters that are common.

Since R is misplaced, we should avoid putting R in the second slot again, but we already know second slot is wrong for R.

Possible words:
- If R is first: R _ A _ _ 
  - Examples: ""ROAST"", but we have S and T? T is absent so ""ROAST"" has T which is bad. No T or E or C.
  - ""RADAR"": has R in first and fifth, A in third, and D and R. But D is new. However, note that R is already known to be in the word, but we might get duplicate R? The feedback doesn't tell about duplicates? Actually, the feedback might reveal duplicates if present.

But note: In our first guess, ""crate"" had one R and we got a minus for R. It doesn't say how many R. So the word might have more than one R? We don't know.

But in ""crate"", we had R only once. If the secret word has two R's, then we might have gotten two minuses? Or only one if the second one is not matched? But in Wordle rules, if a letter appears multiple times, it gets feedback based on how many are in the word.

Important: The feedback is per letter, but we don't know the counts from the feedback alone. However, if we guess a word with multiple same letters, and the secret has duplicates, it can be tricky.

But our first guess had only one R. So we know R is at least once in the word.

Back to word choice.

Words with A in third position and R somewhere else:

- Option: ""BRAVE"" → but we have E? E is absent. Rejected.

- ""DRAWL"": has A in third? D-R-A-W-L → A is third? D(1), R(2), A(3), W(4), L(5). But remember, R was misplaced in the second position? We guessed R in second and got minus, meaning R is not in second position. So in ""DRAWL"", we put R in the second position again? That would give us the same error. So we cannot put R in the second position because we know it's wrong.

Therefore, we must avoid using R in the second position in the new guess.

So for ""R _ A _ _"", we can put R in first? Then second position could be something else.

Examples:
- ""GRAPH"": has A in third? G-R-A-P-H → A is fourth? No, G(1), R(2), A(3)? Actually, positions are: 1: G, 2: R, 3: A? But we are putting R in second position, which is forbidden because we've established R is not in second position. So ""GRAPH"" puts R in second → bad.

We must avoid second position for R.

So if we want R in the word, and avoid second position, then options:
- Position 1: R
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: R

Therefore, we can structure as:

Option 1: R _ A _ _
But second slot cannot be R, so it can be something else. Example: ""ROBIN""? But A in third? R-O-B-I-N? Third letter is B → no. Not A in third.

We need A in third: so for first word, it has to be _ _ A _ _

With R in a different slot.

How about:
- First slot R: R ? A ? ? → with ? avoiding known absent letters.
- Second slot not R, and we'll put a new letter we haven't tried.
- Fourth slot?
- Fifth slot?

Example words:
- ""RAYON"": R-A-Y-O-N? That doesn't have A in third. Positions: R(1), A(2), ... → A is in second? Third is Y? No.

We must have A in third: so the pattern is letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.

Therefore, if R is in first position: the word is R ? A ? ? → R _ A _ _

Examples: ""RAMAN"", but not common. ""RABAT""? Too obscure.

Common words: ""RADAR"" → but T in it? No. R-A-D-A-R? Positions: 
- 1: R
- 2: A → but we need A at position 3? Here A is at position 2? So no. For ""RADAR"", the word is R(1), A(2), D(3), A(4), R(5) → so third letter is D, not A → does not have A at third? Therefore wrong pattern.

Need A at third: so only letters where second letter isn't A? Actually, A is fixed at third. So let’s list words ending with A at third.

Better to think: words with third letter A. Example: ""LLAMA""? But we don't want repeated or obscure?

""MANGA""? But let's avoid duplicates for now.

More common: ""PIANO"" → but P-I-A-N-O? A is third? Yes! Positions: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5). Now, we need to include R? But ""PIANO"" has no R. We must include R to test for its presence.

Since R is in the word, we must have R in the new guess to find its position.

But we don't necessarily have to include R in the new guess? Actually, we can guess a word without R and if we get it, then R might be revealed? But the feedback will tell us about the letters. However, it's better to include R to pin the position.

Alternative: we can use a word that has R in a new position (like first) and also tests other consonants.

But we must avoid E, T, C? And also, we know the third letter is A.

Possible: ""PARIS"" → P-A-R-I-S? Third letter R? But we need A in third? Here, third letter R → no. A is second? Not third.

Must be exactly third letter A.

Another: ""BASIC"" → has C? C is absent. And B-A-S-I-C? Third is S? Second is A? No pattern: B(1)=B, B(2)=A, B(3)=S? A is second? No.

What about: ""PLAIT"" → P-L-A-I-T? Third letter A? Yes: P(1)=P, L(2)=L, A(3)=A, I(4)=I, T(5)=T? But T is absent? And E? T is absent so we cannot use T.

Absent letters: C, T, E. Must avoid them.

So with A in third and no C, T, E.

Word: ""MANOR"" → M-A-N-O-R? Third letter N? Not A → no: position1=M,2=A,3=N,4=O,5=R? So second is A, third is N? Doesn't have A at third? In this, A is at second? Not third.

We need pattern: ? ? A ? ?

So for ""MANOR"", it has A in second? That's not the third.

What about: ""FLAIR"" → F-L-A-I-R? Positions: F(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). Perfect! Third letter A. Letters involved: F, L, A, I, R.

Avoided C, T, E? Yes.

R is in the fifth position? That's good, because we know R is present but not in second position. Now fifth position is new.

Additionally, we test F, L, and I? All new.

So let's consider ""FLAIR"" as a candidate.

But we also need to check if it's a valid word? Yes, flair is a valid English word.

Other options?

""BRAID"" → B-R-A-I-D? Third letter A? Positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). But here, R is in the second position! We know from previous feedback that R is not in the second position. So if we guess ""BRAID"", putting R in second, we might get a minus again? Actually, we already know R is misplaced in second, so it shouldn't be placed there again. So ""BRAID"" would waste the R position and we know it's wrong.

Therefore, ""BRAID"" is not a good choice because it puts R in a known wrong position.

Similarly, ""GRASP"" → G-R-A-S-P? R in second? Again, same issue.

""OPERATION"" is 8 letters? No.

Shorter: ""ABOUT"" → A-B-O-U-T? Third letter O? Not A → no.

""ADAPT"" → A-D-A-P-T? Third letter A? Positions: A(1), D(2), A(3), P(4), T(5). But T is absent? And D and P new. But also, T is absent so we can't use T. So ""ADAPT"" has T? T is absent → rejected.

Back to ""FLAIR"": F-L-A-I-R → letters: F, L, A, I, R; no forbidden letters and A at third.

Another word: ""PLAIN"" → has no R? But we need to test R? Not necessarily, but we should include R to locate it.

Since R must be in 1,4, or 5 positions, we should try to cover one of those.

In ""FLAIR"":
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: A (correct as we know)
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: R

So we have R in position 5? That might be one candidate location.

Another choice: ""RAINS"" → R-A-I-N-S? Third letter I? Not A → no: position1=R,2=A,3=I? That's not A at third; A is at second.

Need A at third? Exactly third.

How about ""SALAD""? S-A-L-A-D? Third letter L? Not A → positions: S1, A2, L3, A4, D5? So A at 2 and 4? But third is L? Not A.

""MARKS""? M-A-R-K-S? Third letter R? Not A → no.

""WHEAT""? Has E? E absent? And W-H-E-A-T? Third letter E? Also E is absent → bad.

Better word: ""CLAIM""? But C is absent? We can't use C.

""AVAIL""? A-V-A-I-L? Third letter A? Positions: A1, V2, A3, I4, L5. But A1 and A3? Third letter is A. But also, A is already known to be in third, so we're covering. However, we need R? No R.

But we must include R? Not mandatory, but if we don't, we don't get info on R position.

So perhaps ""AVAIL"" is not good because it misses R.

Ideal: cover R in a new position and introduce new letters.

Another word: ""CARAT"" → C is absent? And T absent? Rejected.

""GUARD""? G-U-A-R-D? Third letter A? Positions: G1, U2, A3, R4, D5? Perfect! Third letter A, and R is in the fourth position? Which is new. Letters: G, U, A, R, D? Avoid forbidden? Yes: no C, T, E.

But G-U-A-R-D is ""GUARD""? Yes, guard is a valid word.

Also, ""FLAIR"" we considered earlier.

Now, which one is better between ""FLAIR"" and ""GUARD""?

In ""FLAIR"": letters: F, L, A, I, R
In ""GUARD"": letters: G, U, A, R, D

Both have A at third and R in a new position (R at fifth in flair and fourth in guard).

We also want to avoid reusing incorrect positions? We don't know positions for letters other than A.

But in first guess, we tested positions:
- Pos1: C (absent)
- Pos2: R (wrong position)
- Pos3: A (correct)
- Pos4: T (absent)
- Pos5: E (absent)

So positions 1,4,5 are still unknown? Yes.

In ""FLAIR"":
- Pos1: F (we test position 1 with F)
- Pos2: L (test position 2 with L)
- Pos3: A (known, so will be ✓)
- Pos4: I (test position 4 with I)
- Pos5: R (test position 5 with R)

Similarly in ""GUARD"":
- Pos1: G
- Pos2: U
- Pos3: A
- Pos4: R (test position 4 with R)
- Pos5: D

We know R is present but not in pos2, so putting R in pos4 might reveal it.

""FLAIR"" tests positions 1,2,4,5? Yes.

Both good? We should pick one.

Perhaps ""GUARD"" duplicates R? No, guard has one R.

But let's count letters: FLAIR has unique letters? F,L,A,I,R all distinct.

GUARD has G,U,A,R,D → distinct.

But note: in the secret word, we have R and no C,T,E.

Another point: which common letters? Let's see frequency.

We might also consider ""DRAIN""? But D-R-A-I-N? Positions: D(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). But R is in second position? We know R is not in second, so we should not put R in second again? Yes! So ""DRAIN"" would put R in second, which is wrong position? So it would give minus, but we already know that? So it doesn't help? We should avoid.

Therefore, ""DRAIN"" is not good.

So back to choices: FLAIR or GUARD.

I think either is fine.

But to decide: ""GUARD"" introduces U and D? U is less common? Perhaps ""FLAIR"" has more common letters: F, L, I might be better.

Since we have only 6 tries, let's choose ""FLAIR"".

Another word: ""PARAD"": not common? Better stick to common words.

So I'll go with ""FLAIR"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":
- **Feedback interpretation**: 
  - C not in word → eliminate C (cannot use).
  - R is in the word but not in position 2 → we must include R in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Also, it avoids repeating letters.\n\n<guess>crate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":\n- C: x → not in the word\n- R: - → R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed R as the second letter and it\'s wrong position)\n- A: ✓ → A is in the word and in the correct position (third position, since we guessed A as the third letter)\n- T: x → not in the word\n- E: x → not in the word\n\nWe know:\n- A is present and in the third position (so the secret word has A as the third letter: _ _ A _ _)\n- R is present but not in the second position (so R is either in the first, fourth, or fifth position)\n- C, T, E are not in the word at all.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.\n\nOur new guess must:\n- Not contain C, T, E (since they are absent)\n- Include R (because R is in the word, but not in the second position)\n- Have A in the third position.\n\nWe should try to test other common letters and positions.\n\nPossible positions for R: It cannot be in the second position, so it must be in 1st, 4th, or 5th. We haven\'t tested the first, fourth, or fifth positions yet.\n\nWe also know that the word has A in the third position, so the pattern is: _ _ A _ _\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit:\n- Must have A in the third slot.\n- Must include R, but not in the second slot (so R in 1st, 4th, or 5th).\n- Avoid C, T, E.\n\nWe want to maximize information by covering new letters and different positions.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we also know the second position should not be R, and we have no information about other positions.\n\nLet me come up with a word that has:\n- A in the third position.\n- R in either 1st, 4th, or 5th.\n- And uses other letters that are common.\n\nSince R is misplaced, we should avoid putting R in the second slot again, but we already know second slot is wrong for R.\n\nPossible words:\n- If R is first: R _ A _ _ \n  - Examples: ""ROAST"", but we have S and T? T is absent so ""ROAST"" has T which is bad. No T or E or C.\n  - ""RADAR"": has R in first and fifth, A in third, and D and R. But D is new. However, note that R is already known to be in the word, but we might get duplicate R? The feedback doesn\'t tell about duplicates? Actually, the feedback might reveal duplicates if present.\n\nBut note: In our first guess, ""crate"" had one R and we got a minus for R. It doesn\'t say how many R. So the word might have more than one R? We don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""crate"", we had R only once. If the secret word has two R\'s, then we might have gotten two minuses? Or only one if the second one is not matched? But in Wordle rules, if a letter appears multiple times, it gets feedback based on how many are in the word.\n\nImportant: The feedback is per letter, but we don\'t know the counts from the feedback alone. However, if we guess a word with multiple same letters, and the secret has duplicates, it can be tricky.\n\nBut our first guess had only one R. So we know R is at least once in the word.\n\nBack to word choice.\n\nWords with A in third position and R somewhere else:\n\n- Option: ""BRAVE"" → but we have E? E is absent. Rejected.\n\n- ""DRAWL"": has A in third? D-R-A-W-L → A is third? D(1), R(2), A(3), W(4), L(5). But remember, R was misplaced in the second position? We guessed R in second and got minus, meaning R is not in second position. So in ""DRAWL"", we put R in the second position again? That would give us the same error. So we cannot put R in the second position because we know it\'s wrong.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid using R in the second position in the new guess.\n\nSo for ""R _ A _ _"", we can put R in first? Then second position could be something else.\n\nExamples:\n- ""GRAPH"": has A in third? G-R-A-P-H → A is fourth? No, G(1), R(2), A(3)? Actually, positions are: 1: G, 2: R, 3: A? But we are putting R in second position, which is forbidden because we\'ve established R is not in second position. So ""GRAPH"" puts R in second → bad.\n\nWe must avoid second position for R.\n\nSo if we want R in the word, and avoid second position, then options:\n- Position 1: R\n- Position 4: R\n- Position 5: R\n\nTherefore, we can structure as:\n\nOption 1: R _ A _ _\nBut second slot cannot be R, so it can be something else. Example: ""ROBIN""? But A in third? R-O-B-I-N? Third letter is B → no. Not A in third.\n\nWe need A in third: so for first word, it has to be _ _ A _ _\n\nWith R in a different slot.\n\nHow about:\n- First slot R: R ? A ? ? → with ? avoiding known absent letters.\n- Second slot not R, and we\'ll put a new letter we haven\'t tried.\n- Fourth slot?\n- Fifth slot?\n\nExample words:\n- ""RAYON"": R-A-Y-O-N? That doesn\'t have A in third. Positions: R(1), A(2), ... → A is in second? Third is Y? No.\n\nWe must have A in third: so the pattern is letter1, letter2, A, letter4, letter5.\n\nTherefore, if R is in first position: the word is R ? A ? ? → R _ A _ _\n\nExamples: ""RAMAN"", but not common. ""RABAT""? Too obscure.\n\nCommon words: ""RADAR"" → but T in it? No. R-A-D-A-R? Positions: \n- 1: R\n- 2: A → but we need A at position 3? Here A is at position 2? So no. For ""RADAR"", the word is R(1), A(2), D(3), A(4), R(5) → so third letter is D, not A → does not have A at third? Therefore wrong pattern.\n\nNeed A at third: so only letters where second letter isn\'t A? Actually, A is fixed at third. So let’s list words ending with A at third.\n\nBetter to think: words with third letter A. Example: ""LLAMA""? But we don\'t want repeated or obscure?\n\n""MANGA""? But let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\nMore common: ""PIANO"" → but P-I-A-N-O? A is third? Yes! Positions: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5). Now, we need to include R? But ""PIANO"" has no R. We must include R to test for its presence.\n\nSince R is in the word, we must have R in the new guess to find its position.\n\nBut we don\'t necessarily have to include R in the new guess? Actually, we can guess a word without R and if we get it, then R might be revealed? But the feedback will tell us about the letters. However, it\'s better to include R to pin the position.\n\nAlternative: we can use a word that has R in a new position (like first) and also tests other consonants.\n\nBut we must avoid E, T, C? And also, we know the third letter is A.\n\nPossible: ""PARIS"" → P-A-R-I-S? Third letter R? But we need A in third? Here, third letter R → no. A is second? Not third.\n\nMust be exactly third letter A.\n\nAnother: ""BASIC"" → has C? C is absent. And B-A-S-I-C? Third is S? Second is A? No pattern: B(1)=B, B(2)=A, B(3)=S? A is second? No.\n\nWhat about: ""PLAIT"" → P-L-A-I-T? Third letter A? Yes: P(1)=P, L(2)=L, A(3)=A, I(4)=I, T(5)=T? But T is absent? And E? T is absent so we cannot use T.\n\nAbsent letters: C, T, E. Must avoid them.\n\nSo with A in third and no C, T, E.\n\nWord: ""MANOR"" → M-A-N-O-R? Third letter N? Not A → no: position1=M,2=A,3=N,4=O,5=R? So second is A, third is N? Doesn\'t have A at third? In this, A is at second? Not third.\n\nWe need pattern: ? ? A ? ?\n\nSo for ""MANOR"", it has A in second? That\'s not the third.\n\nWhat about: ""FLAIR"" → F-L-A-I-R? Positions: F(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), R(5). Perfect! Third letter A. Letters involved: F, L, A, I, R.\n\nAvoided C, T, E? Yes.\n\nR is in the fifth position? That\'s good, because we know R is present but not in second position. Now fifth position is new.\n\nAdditionally, we test F, L, and I? All new.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""FLAIR"" as a candidate.\n\nBut we also need to check if it\'s a valid word? Yes, flair is a valid English word.\n\nOther options?\n\n""BRAID"" → B-R-A-I-D? Third letter A? Positions: B(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). But here, R is in the second position! We know from previous feedback that R is not in the second position. So if we guess ""BRAID"", putting R in second, we might get a minus again? Actually, we already know R is misplaced in second, so it shouldn\'t be placed there again. So ""BRAID"" would waste the R position and we know it\'s wrong.\n\nTherefore, ""BRAID"" is not a good choice because it puts R in a known wrong position.\n\nSimilarly, ""GRASP"" → G-R-A-S-P? R in second? Again, same issue.\n\n""OPERATION"" is 8 letters? No.\n\nShorter: ""ABOUT"" → A-B-O-U-T? Third letter O? Not A → no.\n\n""ADAPT"" → A-D-A-P-T? Third letter A? Positions: A(1), D(2), A(3), P(4), T(5). But T is absent? And D and P new. But also, T is absent so we can\'t use T. So ""ADAPT"" has T? T is absent → rejected.\n\nBack to ""FLAIR"": F-L-A-I-R → letters: F, L, A, I, R; no forbidden letters and A at third.\n\nAnother word: ""PLAIN"" → has no R? But we need to test R? Not necessarily, but we should include R to locate it.\n\nSince R must be in 1,4, or 5 positions, we should try to cover one of those.\n\nIn ""FLAIR"":\n- Position 1: F\n- Position 2: L\n- Position 3: A (correct as we know)\n- Position 4: I\n- Position 5: R\n\nSo we have R in position 5? That might be one candidate location.\n\nAnother choice: ""RAINS"" → R-A-I-N-S? Third letter I? Not A → no: position1=R,2=A,3=I? That\'s not A at third; A is at second.\n\nNeed A at third? Exactly third.\n\nHow about ""SALAD""? S-A-L-A-D? Third letter L? Not A → positions: S1, A2, L3, A4, D5? So A at 2 and 4? But third is L? Not A.\n\n""MARKS""? M-A-R-K-S? Third letter R? Not A → no.\n\n""WHEAT""? Has E? E absent? And W-H-E-A-T? Third letter E? Also E is absent → bad.\n\nBetter word: ""CLAIM""? But C is absent? We can\'t use C.\n\n""AVAIL""? A-V-A-I-L? Third letter A? Positions: A1, V2, A3, I4, L5. But A1 and A3? Third letter is A. But also, A is already known to be in third, so we\'re covering. However, we need R? No R.\n\nBut we must include R? Not mandatory, but if we don\'t, we don\'t get info on R position.\n\nSo perhaps ""AVAIL"" is not good because it misses R.\n\nIdeal: cover R in a new position and introduce new letters.\n\nAnother word: ""CARAT"" → C is absent? And T absent? Rejected.\n\n""GUARD""? G-U-A-R-D? Third letter A? Positions: G1, U2, A3, R4, D5? Perfect! Third letter A, and R is in the fourth position? Which is new. Letters: G, U, A, R, D? Avoid forbidden? Yes: no C, T, E.\n\nBut G-U-A-R-D is ""GUARD""? Yes, guard is a valid word.\n\nAlso, ""FLAIR"" we considered earlier.\n\nNow, which one is better between ""FLAIR"" and ""GUARD""?\n\nIn ""FLAIR"": letters: F, L, A, I, R\nIn ""GUARD"": letters: G, U, A, R, D\n\nBoth have A at third and R in a new position (R at fifth in flair and fourth in guard).\n\nWe also want to avoid reusing incorrect positions? We don\'t know positions for letters other than A.\n\nBut in first guess, we tested positions:\n- Pos1: C (absent)\n- Pos2: R (wrong position)\n- Pos3: A (correct)\n- Pos4: T (absent)\n- Pos5: E (absent)\n\nSo positions 1,4,5 are still unknown? Yes.\n\nIn ""FLAIR"":\n- Pos1: F (we test position 1 with F)\n- Pos2: L (test position 2 with L)\n- Pos3: A (known, so will be ✓)\n- Pos4: I (test position 4 with I)\n- Pos5: R (test position 5 with R)\n\nSimilarly in ""GUARD"":\n- Pos1: G\n- Pos2: U\n- Pos3: A\n- Pos4: R (test position 4 with R)\n- Pos5: D\n\nWe know R is present but not in pos2, so putting R in pos4 might reveal it.\n\n""FLAIR"" tests positions 1,2,4,5? Yes.\n\nBoth good? We should pick one.\n\nPerhaps ""GUARD"" duplicates R? No, guard has one R.\n\nBut let\'s count letters: FLAIR has unique letters? F,L,A,I,R all distinct.\n\nGUARD has G,U,A,R,D → distinct.\n\nBut note: in the secret word, we have R and no C,T,E.\n\nAnother point: which common letters? Let\'s see frequency.\n\nWe might also consider ""DRAIN""? But D-R-A-I-N? Positions: D(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). But R is in second position? We know R is not in second, so we should not put R in second again? Yes! So ""DRAIN"" would put R in second, which is wrong position? So it would give minus, but we already know that? So it doesn\'t help? We should avoid.\n\nTherefore, ""DRAIN"" is not good.\n\nSo back to choices: FLAIR or GUARD.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nBut to decide: ""GUARD"" introduces U and D? U is less common? Perhaps ""FLAIR"" has more common letters: F, L, I might be better.\n\nSince we have only 6 tries, let\'s choose ""FLAIR"".\n\nAnother word: ""PARAD"": not common? Better stick to common words.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""FLAIR"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crate"":\n- **Feedback interpretation**: \n  - C not in word → eliminate C (cannot use).\n  - R is in the word but not in position 2 → we must include R in positions 1, 4, or 5.\n  - A is correct and in position 3 → third letter must be A.\n  - T and E not in word → eliminate T and E (cannot use).\n- Updated constraints: Secret word pattern is `_ _ A _ _`, with R present (but not in position 2), and excludes C, E, T.\n- Strategy for second guess: \n  - Must include R in positions 1, 4, or 5 to test its location.\n  - Avoid using R in position 2 (known wrong).\n  - Introduce new high-frequency consonant/l vowel letters to maximize information: tested F, L, I, while avoiding forbidden letters.\n  - Selected ""FLAIR"":\n    - Fits pattern `F L A I R` → A is in position 3 (correct).\n    - R is placed in position 5 (one allowed untested position).\n    - Tests new letters F, L, I in positions 1, 2, and 4.\n    - Uses common English word.\n\n<guess>flair</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crate -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: flair -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) A(✓) I(x) R(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: ""crate""**
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, but wrong position; not position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)
- T: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

**Guess 2: ""flair""**
- F: x (not in word)
- L: - (in word, but wrong position; not position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)
- I: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, but wrong position; not position 5)

**Summary of known information:**
1. **Correct position:** 
   - Position 3 is A → pattern: _ _ A _ _
2. **Present letters (but wrong position):**
   - R: present, but not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 5 (from guess 2). Therefore, R must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is A, and positions 2 and 5 are ruled out).
   - L: present, but not in position 2 (from guess 2). It could be in position 1, 4, or 5? But position 5 is still possible? Let's see: in ""flair"", L was in position 2 and got minus, so L is not in position 2. But it could be in 1, 4, or 5? However, position 1 and 4 are still untested for L? Actually, we haven't tested L in other positions yet.
3. **Absent letters:** C, T, E, F, I (so we cannot use these).
4. **Pattern constraint:** The word is _ _ A _ _

**Deductions:**
- R must be in position 1 or 4 (because it can't be in 2, 3, or 5). Position 3 is A, so R can only be in 1 or 4.
- L is present but not in position 2. It could be in position 1, 4, or 5? But note: if R is in position 1, then position 1 is taken by R, so L cannot be there. Similarly, if R is in position 4, then position 4 is taken. Also, position 5 is available for L? But we need to consider.

**Possible positions for L:**
- Since L is not in position 2, and we have positions 1, 4, 5 open? But position 1 and 4 might be taken by R? Not necessarily, but we don't know yet.

**We need to resolve R's position first?** Actually, we can design a guess that tests both possibilities.

**Available letters:** We can use any letters except C, T, E, F, I. Also, we know A and R are in the word, and L is in the word.

**New guess must:**
- Have A in position 3.
- Include R (to pin its position, either 1 or 4).
- Include L (to pin its position, but avoid position 2).
- Avoid C, T, E, F, I.

**Possible patterns:**
Since R must be in 1 or 4, we can consider two cases:

**Case 1: R in position 1 → pattern: R _ A _ _**
- Then L must be in 4 or 5 (since not in 2, and 1 is taken by R).
- We need to fill position 2 and the remaining position (4 or 5) with new letters.

**Case 2: R in position 4 → pattern: _ _ A R _**
- Then L must be in 1 or 5 (since not in 2, and 4 is taken by R).

We can design a guess that helps distinguish between these cases and tests L's position.

**Idea for next guess:**
- We need to test position 1 and 4 for R? But we can do that by putting R in one of them and a new letter in the other? But we can only put one R? Unless we use a word with two R's? But we don't know if the word has two R's? From feedback, we only know R is present at least once.

But in ""crate"" we had one R and got one minus, and in ""flair"" we had one R and got one minus. It doesn't indicate duplicates? So the word might have only one R? Or more? We don't know.

To be safe, assume one R for now? But we can use a word with R in a position to test.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has R in position 1 and a different letter in position 4? Or vice versa.

But we also have L to place.

**Let's list possible words that fit the constraints.**

First, pattern: _ _ A _ _

Available positions: 1,2,4,5.

Letters to include: R and L must be in {1,4,5} but not in position 2? L cannot be in 2, R cannot be in 2,3,5? R cannot be in 2 or 5? From feedback, R not in 2 (from guess1) and not in 5 (from guess2). So R must be in 1 or 4.

Similarly, L not in 2 (from guess2), so L in 1,4,5? But if R is in 1, then L cannot be in 1? So L in 4 or 5? If R is in 4, then L in 1 or 5.

So the word must have:
- Position 1: either R or L or a new letter? But R and L must be placed, so position 1 must be one of them or a new letter? But we have to include both R and L? Yes, because they are in the word.

Therefore, the possibilities for position 1: R or L? Or could it be a new letter? But if we put a new letter in position 1, then we must put R and L in positions 4 and 5? But positions 4 and 5 are only two positions? And we have two letters? So possible? But then we don't test position 1 for R or L? It might be inefficient.

But we need to cover.

**Let's think of words with pattern _ _ A _ _ and including R and L, avoiding C,T,E,F,I.**

Available letters: A, R, L, and others except forbidden.

Forbidden: C, E, F, I, T.

So available: B, D, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and A, R, L.

But A is fixed at position 3.

**Possible words:**

First, if R in position 1 and L in position 4: pattern R ? A L ?
- We need to fill position 2 and 5 with new letters? Position 2 must be a letter, and position 5 must be a letter.
- Example: ""R O A L D"" → ""ROALD""? Not a common word.
- ""R U A L K"" → not a word.

Better: ""R O A R S""? But has two R's? And S is available? But we don't know if S is in the word? ""roars"" is a word? But let's see: R(1), O(2), A(3), R(4), S(5). But we have R in position 1 and 4? But we are testing R in position 1? And L is not included? We need to include L? But in this word, no L? So missing L.

We must include L.

So for R in 1 and L in 4: pattern R ? A L ?
- Words: ""R O A L D"" → not common.
- ""R E A L M"" → but E is forbidden? E absent.
- ""R U A L S"" → ""ruals"" not a word.

Not many options.

If R in 1 and L in 5: pattern R ? A ? L
- Words: ""R O A D L"" → not a word? ""ROADL"" no.
- ""R A A L S"" → ""raals"" not common? And A in second? But we have A at third, so second cannot be A? Pattern is R ? A ? L, so second position is unknown, third is A, fourth unknown, fifth L.
- ""R O A M L"" → no.
- ""R E A L L Y"" too long.

Not easy.

Now, if R in position 4 and L in position 1: pattern L ? A R ?
- Words: ""L O A R D"" → not a word.
- ""L A A R D"" → not.

If R in 4 and L in 5: pattern ? ? A R L
- Words: ""B A R L"" → but only 4 letters? 5 letters: ? ? A R L → so two letters before A.
- ""U N A R L"" → not a word.
- ""S N A R L"" → S-N-A-R-L? Positions: S(1), N(2), A(3), R(4), L(5). Perfect! And S and N are new letters? And avoid forbidden? S, N, A, R, L → no C,T,E,F,I.

""S N A R L"" is ""snarl"", a valid English word.

Now, check if it fits:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: A (correct)
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: L

We are testing:
- R in position 4? Which is one of the possibilities (R must be in 1 or 4, so position 4 is a candidate).
- L in position 5? Which is possible since L can be in 1,4,5? But in this case, we put it in 5.
- Also, we test S in position 1 and N in position 2.

Moreover, we avoid forbidden letters.

Another possibility: if we put L in position 1 and R in position 4? Pattern: L ? A R ?
- Words: ""L A R R Y"" → but A in second? Not third? Pattern must have A at third: so L(1), ?(2), A(3), R(4), ?(5)
- ""L O A R S"" → ""loars"" not a word.
- ""L U A R D"" → not common.

""snarl"" seems good.

But in ""snarl"", we have R in position 4 and L in position 5.

We also need to consider if there are other words that test more positions? For example, if we put R in position 1 and L in position 4 or 5, but we couldn't find common words.

Another word: ""RALPH"" → R-A-L-P-H? But A is in second? Not third? Pattern: R(1), A(2), L(3), P(4), H(5) → but we need A at third? Here A is at second? So no.

""PLAID"" → P-L-A-I-D? But I is absent? I is forbidden.

""GLAND"" → G-L-A-N-D? Positions: G(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). But L is in position 2? We know L is not in position 2 from guess2 feedback? In ""flair"", L was in position 2 and got minus, so L cannot be in position 2. So ""GLAND"" would put L in position 2 again? Which is known wrong? So we should avoid.

Similarly, any word with L in position 2 is bad.

Therefore, ""snarl"" is a good candidate because:
- It has L in position 5 (not 2) and R in position 4 (not 2 or 5, which are forbidden for R? R forbidden in 2 and 5, so 4 is good).
- It tests new letters S and N in positions 1 and 2.

If the secret word is ""snarl"", then we might solve it? Or get feedback.

But we don't know if it has S or N.

Another word: ""DROLL"" → D-R-O-L-L? But R in position 2? R cannot be in position 2? And also, pattern: D(1), R(2), O(3), L(4), L(5) → but position 3 is O, not A? We need A at third? So no.

""BROAD"" → B-R-O-A-D? Position 4 is A? Not third? Pattern: B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5) → A at fourth? But we need A at third? So no.

So ""snarl"" seems a solid choice.

But let's confirm the word: ""snarl"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, I will guess ""snarl"".

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1: ""crate"" → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(✓), T(x), E(x)**  
     - C, T, E are absent from the secret word (cannot be used).
     - R is present but not in position 2.
     - A is correct and in position 3 (secret word pattern: `_ _ A _ _`).
   - **Guess 2: ""flair"" → Feedback: F(x), L(-), A(✓), I(x), R(-)**  
     - F and I are absent (cannot be used).
     - L is present but not in position 2.
     - A is still correct in position 3 (confirms pattern `_ _ A _ _`).
     - R is present but not in position 5 (since it got ""-"" in position 5).

2. **Key Constraints:**
   - **Secret word pattern:** `_ _ A _ _` (position 3 is A).
   - **Present letters (must be included):** 
     - R: Must be in position 1 or 4 (cannot be in 2, 3, or 5 based on feedback).
     - L: Must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be in 2 based on feedback).
   - **Absent letters (cannot be used):** C, E, F, I, T.
   - **Available letters:** All letters except C, E, F, I, T (e.g., B, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - Must include both R and L to test their positions (since both are confirmed present).
   - R can only be in position 1 or 4, and L can only be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but positions 1 and 4 might conflict if both R and L are placed there, so we need to prioritize testing these positions).
   - Avoid reusing known incorrect positions (e.g., no R in 2 or 5, no L in 2).
   - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., S, N, D, O) to maximize information.
   - Ideal word: Fits the pattern `_ _ A _ _`, includes R and L in valid positions, and uses new letters to test untested positions (1, 2, 4, 5).

4. **Word Selection:**
   - After evaluating options, ""snarl"" fits perfectly:
     - Pattern: `S N A R L` → Position 3 is A (correct).
     - R is in position 4 (tests one of the allowed positions for R: 1 or 4).
     - L is in position 5 (tests one of the allowed positions for L: 1, 4, or 5).
     - New letters S (position 1) and N (position 2) are tested.
     - No forbidden letters (C, E, F, I, T are avoided).
     - ""Snarl"" is a valid English word (meaning: to growl or tangle).

5. **Expected Outcomes:**
   - If R is in position 4 and L in position 5, this guess could be correct or provide clear feedback to narrow down further.
   - If not, feedback on S, N, R (position 4), and L (position 5) will help identify the exact positions of R and L and reveal new letters.

<guess>snarl</guess>",snarl,"We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: ""crate""**
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, but wrong position; not position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)
- T: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

**Guess 2: ""flair""**
- F: x (not in word)
- L: - (in word, but wrong position; not position 2)
- A: ✓ (correct, position 3)
- I: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, but wrong position; not position 5)

**Summary of known information:**
1. **Correct position:** 
   - Position 3 is A → pattern: _ _ A _ _
2. **Present letters (but wrong position):**
   - R: present, but not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 5 (from guess 2). Therefore, R must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is A, and positions 2 and 5 are ruled out).
   - L: present, but not in position 2 (from guess 2). It could be in position 1, 4, or 5? But position 5 is still possible? Let's see: in ""flair"", L was in position 2 and got minus, so L is not in position 2. But it could be in 1, 4, or 5? However, position 1 and 4 are still untested for L? Actually, we haven't tested L in other positions yet.
3. **Absent letters:** C, T, E, F, I (so we cannot use these).
4. **Pattern constraint:** The word is _ _ A _ _

**Deductions:**
- R must be in position 1 or 4 (because it can't be in 2, 3, or 5). Position 3 is A, so R can only be in 1 or 4.
- L is present but not in position 2. It could be in position 1, 4, or 5? But note: if R is in position 1, then position 1 is taken by R, so L cannot be there. Similarly, if R is in position 4, then position 4 is taken. Also, position 5 is available for L? But we need to consider.

**Possible positions for L:**
- Since L is not in position 2, and we have positions 1, 4, 5 open? But position 1 and 4 might be taken by R? Not necessarily, but we don't know yet.

**We need to resolve R's position first?** Actually, we can design a guess that tests both possibilities.

**Available letters:** We can use any letters except C, T, E, F, I. Also, we know A and R are in the word, and L is in the word.

**New guess must:**
- Have A in position 3.
- Include R (to pin its position, either 1 or 4).
- Include L (to pin its position, but avoid position 2).
- Avoid C, T, E, F, I.

**Possible patterns:**
Since R must be in 1 or 4, we can consider two cases:

**Case 1: R in position 1 → pattern: R _ A _ _**
- Then L must be in 4 or 5 (since not in 2, and 1 is taken by R).
- We need to fill position 2 and the remaining position (4 or 5) with new letters.

**Case 2: R in position 4 → pattern: _ _ A R _**
- Then L must be in 1 or 5 (since not in 2, and 4 is taken by R).

We can design a guess that helps distinguish between these cases and tests L's position.

**Idea for next guess:**
- We need to test position 1 and 4 for R? But we can do that by putting R in one of them and a new letter in the other? But we can only put one R? Unless we use a word with two R's? But we don't know if the word has two R's? From feedback, we only know R is present at least once.

But in ""crate"" we had one R and got one minus, and in ""flair"" we had one R and got one minus. It doesn't indicate duplicates? So the word might have only one R? Or more? We don't know.

To be safe, assume one R for now? But we can use a word with R in a position to test.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has R in position 1 and a different letter in position 4? Or vice versa.

But we also have L to place.

**Let's list possible words that fit the constraints.**

First, pattern: _ _ A _ _

Available positions: 1,2,4,5.

Letters to include: R and L must be in {1,4,5} but not in position 2? L cannot be in 2, R cannot be in 2,3,5? R cannot be in 2 or 5? From feedback, R not in 2 (from guess1) and not in 5 (from guess2). So R must be in 1 or 4.

Similarly, L not in 2 (from guess2), so L in 1,4,5? But if R is in 1, then L cannot be in 1? So L in 4 or 5? If R is in 4, then L in 1 or 5.

So the word must have:
- Position 1: either R or L or a new letter? But R and L must be placed, so position 1 must be one of them or a new letter? But we have to include both R and L? Yes, because they are in the word.

Therefore, the possibilities for position 1: R or L? Or could it be a new letter? But if we put a new letter in position 1, then we must put R and L in positions 4 and 5? But positions 4 and 5 are only two positions? And we have two letters? So possible? But then we don't test position 1 for R or L? It might be inefficient.

But we need to cover.

**Let's think of words with pattern _ _ A _ _ and including R and L, avoiding C,T,E,F,I.**

Available letters: A, R, L, and others except forbidden.

Forbidden: C, E, F, I, T.

So available: B, D, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and A, R, L.

But A is fixed at position 3.

**Possible words:**

First, if R in position 1 and L in position 4: pattern R ? A L ?
- We need to fill position 2 and 5 with new letters? Position 2 must be a letter, and position 5 must be a letter.
- Example: ""R O A L D"" → ""ROALD""? Not a common word.
- ""R U A L K"" → not a word.

Better: ""R O A R S""? But has two R's? And S is available? But we don't know if S is in the word? ""roars"" is a word? But let's see: R(1), O(2), A(3), R(4), S(5). But we have R in position 1 and 4? But we are testing R in position 1? And L is not included? We need to include L? But in this word, no L? So missing L.

We must include L.

So for R in 1 and L in 4: pattern R ? A L ?
- Words: ""R O A L D"" → not common.
- ""R E A L M"" → but E is forbidden? E absent.
- ""R U A L S"" → ""ruals"" not a word.

Not many options.

If R in 1 and L in 5: pattern R ? A ? L
- Words: ""R O A D L"" → not a word? ""ROADL"" no.
- ""R A A L S"" → ""raals"" not common? And A in second? But we have A at third, so second cannot be A? Pattern is R ? A ? L, so second position is unknown, third is A, fourth unknown, fifth L.
- ""R O A M L"" → no.
- ""R E A L L Y"" too long.

Not easy.

Now, if R in position 4 and L in position 1: pattern L ? A R ?
- Words: ""L O A R D"" → not a word.
- ""L A A R D"" → not.

If R in 4 and L in 5: pattern ? ? A R L
- Words: ""B A R L"" → but only 4 letters? 5 letters: ? ? A R L → so two letters before A.
- ""U N A R L"" → not a word.
- ""S N A R L"" → S-N-A-R-L? Positions: S(1), N(2), A(3), R(4), L(5). Perfect! And S and N are new letters? And avoid forbidden? S, N, A, R, L → no C,T,E,F,I.

""S N A R L"" is ""snarl"", a valid English word.

Now, check if it fits:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: A (correct)
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: L

We are testing:
- R in position 4? Which is one of the possibilities (R must be in 1 or 4, so position 4 is a candidate).
- L in position 5? Which is possible since L can be in 1,4,5? But in this case, we put it in 5.
- Also, we test S in position 1 and N in position 2.

Moreover, we avoid forbidden letters.

Another possibility: if we put L in position 1 and R in position 4? Pattern: L ? A R ?
- Words: ""L A R R Y"" → but A in second? Not third? Pattern must have A at third: so L(1), ?(2), A(3), R(4), ?(5)
- ""L O A R S"" → ""loars"" not a word.
- ""L U A R D"" → not common.

""snarl"" seems good.

But in ""snarl"", we have R in position 4 and L in position 5.

We also need to consider if there are other words that test more positions? For example, if we put R in position 1 and L in position 4 or 5, but we couldn't find common words.

Another word: ""RALPH"" → R-A-L-P-H? But A is in second? Not third? Pattern: R(1), A(2), L(3), P(4), H(5) → but we need A at third? Here A is at second? So no.

""PLAID"" → P-L-A-I-D? But I is absent? I is forbidden.

""GLAND"" → G-L-A-N-D? Positions: G(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), D(5). But L is in position 2? We know L is not in position 2 from guess2 feedback? In ""flair"", L was in position 2 and got minus, so L cannot be in position 2. So ""GLAND"" would put L in position 2 again? Which is known wrong? So we should avoid.

Similarly, any word with L in position 2 is bad.

Therefore, ""snarl"" is a good candidate because:
- It has L in position 5 (not 2) and R in position 4 (not 2 or 5, which are forbidden for R? R forbidden in 2 and 5, so 4 is good).
- It tests new letters S and N in positions 1 and 2.

If the secret word is ""snarl"", then we might solve it? Or get feedback.

But we don't know if it has S or N.

Another word: ""DROLL"" → D-R-O-L-L? But R in position 2? R cannot be in position 2? And also, pattern: D(1), R(2), O(3), L(4), L(5) → but position 3 is O, not A? We need A at third? So no.

""BROAD"" → B-R-O-A-D? Position 4 is A? Not third? Pattern: B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5) → A at fourth? But we need A at third? So no.

So ""snarl"" seems a solid choice.

But let's confirm the word: ""snarl"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, I will guess ""snarl"".
