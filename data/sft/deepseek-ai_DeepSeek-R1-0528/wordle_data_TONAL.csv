We are starting a new game. We have 6 tries to guess for a secret 5-letter English word.
Since there is no prior feedback, we need to make an initial guess that maximizes the information we can get.

A good starting word should have:
- Common letters to increase the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.
- A balanced set of letters (ideally no repeated letters) to test more letters at once.

Some popular starting words in Wordle are: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", ""ADIEU"", ""STARE"", ""ARISE"", etc.

I think let's go with ""CRANE"". It's a good word because:
- It contains common consonants (C, R, N) and a vowel (A, E).
- All letters are distinct.

So I'll guess ""CRANE"". 
</think>
In starting a new game with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose an initial guess that maximizes potential information gain. The word ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains 5 distinct letters, testing more characters in one guess.
- It uses common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), increasing the likelihood of matching letters in the secret word.
- Positions of letters are strategically balanced (e.g., consonants at edges and vowels in the middle) to reveal common placement patterns.

This sets a solid foundation for refining subsequent guesses based on feedback.

We are starting a new game. We have 6 tries to guess a secret 5-letter English word.
I need to choose a good starting word that maximizes information. A strong starting word should:
- Include common letters in the English language (especially vowels)
- Preferably use distinct letters to test more characters at once
- Cover frequent consonants and vowels

After considering words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""CRATE"", and ""ROAST"", I select ""CRANE"" because:
- It uses 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E)
- All 5 letters are distinct
- Its consonant-vowel distribution is balanced (C_V_N_ pattern)
- It tests several high-frequency starting letters (C and R) and ending letters (E)

The next steps will rely on the feedback symbols (✓, -, x) to refine the search in subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the 3rd and 4th positions respectively (since in ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and N in position 4).
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Must include A and N (each at least once, but since it's 5 letters, likely once each unless duplicates, but we don't know yet).
- Does not contain C, R, E.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Includes A and N (to get more information about their positions) and avoids C, R, E.
- We can also try to include other common letters to test.

Since A and N are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4, we should try to place them in different positions.

Possible positions for A: it cannot be in position 3 (from the first guess). So it could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
Similarly, N cannot be in position 4, so it could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have not used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but avoiding C, R, E).

Common letters to consider: S, T, L, O, etc.

We can try to form a word that has A and N in new positions and includes other common letters.

For example:
- Place A in position 1: then the word could start with A, but we have to avoid positions 3 for A? Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3. So we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly for N: avoid position 4, so try in 1,2,3,5.

Let's think of words that have A and N and avoid C, R, E.

Some ideas:
- Try A in position 1: words like ""AN..."" 
  - Example: ""ANTIC"" but we don't know if T and I are in the word. Also, we have to avoid R and E? ""ANTIC"" has no C? Wait, ""ANTIC"" has C? Actually, ""ANTIC"" is a word? Yes, but it ends with C. But we know C is not in the word (from first feedback: C is x). So we cannot use C. So ""ANTIC"" is invalid because it has C.

- Another: ""ANVIL"" -> A, N, V, I, L. This avoids C, R, E. Let's check: 
  - A in position 1 (new position), N in position 2 (new position? in first guess N was in position 4, now we try position 2). Also, we test V, I, L.

But we don't know if V, I, L are in the word. This is acceptable.

- Alternatively, we can try to put A in position 2 and N in position 1? But that would be ""N A ..."", like ""NASTY"". ""NASTY"" has S, T, Y. Avoids C, R, E.

Another idea: since we have two letters to place (A and N) and we want to test more letters, we can choose a word that has A and N and three new letters.

Let me list some words: 
- ""PLAIN"" -> P, L, A, I, N. This has A in position 3? But in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a minus, meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting A in position 3. Similarly, avoid N in position 4.

In ""PLAIN"": 
- P (1), L (2), A (3), I (4), N (5). 
But A is in position 3 again? We know that A is not in position 3, so we should not put A in position 3. Similarly, N is in position 5 (which is new, since previously it was in 4). But we are allowed to put N in 5.

However, putting A in position 3 again would be inefficient because we already know it's not there. So we should try A in a different position.

So let's avoid position 3 for A and position 4 for N.

In ""PLAIN"", A is in position 3 -> not good.

Alternative: ""SNAIL"" -> S, N, A, I, L. 
- Positions: N in 1 (new), A in 3 (again, not good) -> same problem.

""MANGO"" -> M, A, N, G, O. 
- A in position 2 (new), N in position 3 (new, because previously it was in 4). 
- Avoids C, R, E. 
- This seems good: A is in 2 (not 3) and N is in 3 (not 4). We also test M, G, O.

But is ""MANGO"" a valid word? Yes.

Another option: ""PAINT"" -> P, A, I, N, T. 
- A in position 2 (new), N in position 4? But we must avoid N in position 4? Wait, no: the feedback said N is in the word but not in position 4. So we can try N in other positions, but we cannot put it in position 4 because we know it's not there. In ""PAINT"": 
  - P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). 
  - Here N is in position 4 again? That's the same position as before. We know it's not in position 4, so we would get a minus again? But we want to test new positions. So it's better to avoid position 4 for N.

Therefore, ""PAINT"" is not ideal because N is in position 4.

Similarly, we can try ""SAINT"" but S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> same issue with N in 4.

So let's avoid position 4 for N and position 3 for A.

Another word: ""TANGY"" -> T, A, N, G, Y. 
- A in position 2 (new), N in position 3 (new). 
- Avoids C, R, E. 
- This is good.

But ""TANGY"" might be less common. ""MANGO"" is more common.

Another: ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y. But this doesn't have N. We must include N? Not necessarily, but we know the word has N, so if we don't include N, we might not get information about its position. Similarly for A.

It's better to include both A and N to get more information about their positions.

So words that include A and N, with A not in 3 and N not in 4.

Let me think of more:
- ""BALDY"" -> B, A, L, D, Y. No N.
- ""HANDY"" -> H, A, N, D, Y. 
  - Positions: H(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5). 
  - A in 2 (new), N in 3 (new). Avoids position 3 for A and position 4 for N. Also, we test H, D, Y.

This seems good.

- ""FANGS"" -> F, A, N, G, S. 
  - A in 2, N in 3. Also good.

I think ""HANDY"" is a valid word.

But let's choose one that has more common letters. ""MANGO"" is common and uses M, A, N, G, O.

Alternatively, ""PLANK"" -> P, L, A, N, K. 
- A in 3? Not allowed. We must avoid A in 3.

In ""PLANK"": A is in position 3 -> not good.

""SLANG"" -> S, L, A, N, G. 
- A in 3? Again, position 3 -> not good.

""ANGRY"" -> A, N, G, R, Y. But R is in the word? We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R is x). So we cannot use R.

So avoid R.

Therefore, ""MANGO"" seems a good choice: 
- M (new), A (position 2, new), N (position 3, new), G (new), O (new). 
- We avoid C, R, E.

We can also consider ""DAUNT"" -> D, A, U, N, T. 
- A in position 2, N in position 4? But we must avoid N in position 4. So not good.

""ADMIN"" -> A, D, M, I, N. 
- A in position 1 (new), N in position 5 (new). This is good. 
- Avoids C, R, E. 
- Tests A, D, M, I, N.

""ADMIN"" is a valid word (short for administer or administrator, but accepted as a word).

But ""ADMIN"" might be less common in everyday language. ""MANGO"" is more common.

Another: ""PAYNN"" -> not a word, duplicate N? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but typically we assume no duplicates unless feedback shows.

But we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

I think ""MANGO"" is a solid choice.

So I'll go with ""MANGO"".

But let's confirm: 
- M: not tested before -> we'll get feedback.
- A: in the word, but we are putting it in position 2 (previously it was in 3, so new position).
- N: in the word, putting in position 3 (previously in 4, so new position).
- G: new.
- O: new.

This will help us locate A and N and test three new letters.

Therefore, the second guess is ""MANGO"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A and N **are** in the secret word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A is not in position 3, and N is not in position 4.

For the second guess:
- The word must include A and N (since they are in the secret word), but avoid C, R, and E.
- A should not be placed in position 3 (to test a new position), and N should not be placed in position 4.
- To maximize information, include new common letters (e.g., M, G, O) to test their presence.

A strong candidate is ""MANGO"":
- Places A in position 2 (new position to test).
- Places N in position 3 (new position to test).
- Avoids C, R, E, and includes new letters (M, G, O) for additional feedback.

- A in position 2, N in position 4? But we must avoid N in position 4. So not good.

""ADMIN"" -> A, D, M, I, N. 
- A in position 1 (new), N in position 5 (new). This is good. 
- Avoids C, R, E. 
- Tests A, D, M, I, N.

""ADMIN"" is a valid word (short for administer or administrator, but accepted as a word).

But ""ADMIN"" might be less common in everyday language. ""MANGO"" is more common.

Another: ""PAYNN"" -> not a word, duplicate N? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but typically we assume no duplicates unless feedback shows.

But we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

I think ""MANGO"" is a solid choice.

So I'll go with ""MANGO"".

But let's confirm: 
- M: not tested before -> we'll get feedback.
- A: in the word, but we are putting it in position 2 (previously it was in 3, so new position).
- N: in the word, putting in position 3 (previously in 4, so new position).
- G: new.
- O: new.

This will help us locate A and N and test three new letters.

Therefore, the second guess is ""MANGO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A and N **are** in the secret word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A is not in position 3, and N is not in position 4.

For the second guess:
- The word must include A and N (since they are in the secret word), but avoid C, R, and E.
- A should not be placed in position 3 (to test a new position), and N should not be placed in position 4.
- To maximize information, include new common letters (e.g., M, G, O) to test their presence.

A strong candidate is ""MANGO"":
- Places A in position 2 (new position to test).
- Places N in position 3 (new position to test).
- Avoids C, R, E, and includes new letters (M, G, O) for additional feedback.",Guess 2: MANGO -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(-) N(✓) G(x) O(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,TONAL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have 6 tries to guess for a secret 5-letter English word.
Since there is no prior feedback, we need to make an initial guess that maximizes the information we can get.

A good starting word should have:
- Common letters to increase the chance of hitting some letters in the secret word.
- A balanced set of letters (ideally no repeated letters) to test more letters at once.

Some popular starting words in Wordle are: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""ROAST"", ""ADIEU"", ""STARE"", ""ARISE"", etc.

I think let's go with ""CRANE"". It's a good word because:
- It contains common consonants (C, R, N) and a vowel (A, E).
- All letters are distinct.

So I'll guess ""CRANE"".In starting a new game with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose an initial guess that maximizes potential information gain. The word ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains 5 distinct letters, testing more characters in one guess.
- It uses common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), increasing the likelihood of matching letters in the secret word.
- Positions of letters are strategically balanced (e.g., consonants at edges and vowels in the middle) to reveal common placement patterns.

This sets a solid foundation for refining subsequent guesses based on feedback.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the 3rd and 4th positions respectively (since in ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and N in position 4).
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Must include A and N (each at least once, but since it's 5 letters, likely once each unless duplicates, but we don't know yet).
- Does not contain C, R, E.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.
- Includes A and N (to get more information about their positions) and avoids C, R, E.
- We can also try to include other common letters to test.

Since A and N are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4, we should try to place them in different positions.

Possible positions for A: it cannot be in position 3 (from the first guess). So it could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
Similarly, N cannot be in position 4, so it could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have not used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but avoiding C, R, E).

Common letters to consider: S, T, L, O, etc.

We can try to form a word that has A and N in new positions and includes other common letters.

For example:
- Place A in position 1: then the word could start with A, but we have to avoid positions 3 for A? Actually, the feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3. So we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly for N: avoid position 4, so try in 1,2,3,5.

Let's think of words that have A and N and avoid C, R, E.

Some ideas:
- Try A in position 1: words like ""AN..."" 
  - Example: ""ANTIC"" but we don't know if T and I are in the word. Also, we have to avoid R and E? ""ANTIC"" has no C? Wait, ""ANTIC"" has C? Actually, ""ANTIC"" is a word? Yes, but it ends with C. But we know C is not in the word (from first feedback: C is x). So we cannot use C. So ""ANTIC"" is invalid because it has C.

- Another: ""ANVIL"" -> A, N, V, I, L. This avoids C, R, E. Let's check: 
  - A in position 1 (new position), N in position 2 (new position? in first guess N was in position 4, now we try position 2). Also, we test V, I, L.

But we don't know if V, I, L are in the word. This is acceptable.

- Alternatively, we can try to put A in position 2 and N in position 1? But that would be ""N A ..."", like ""NASTY"". ""NASTY"" has S, T, Y. Avoids C, R, E.

Another idea: since we have two letters to place (A and N) and we want to test more letters, we can choose a word that has A and N and three new letters.

Let me list some words: 
- ""PLAIN"" -> P, L, A, I, N. This has A in position 3? But in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a minus, meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting A in position 3. Similarly, avoid N in position 4.

In ""PLAIN"": 
- P (1), L (2), A (3), I (4), N (5). 
But A is in position 3 again? We know that A is not in position 3, so we should not put A in position 3. Similarly, N is in position 5 (which is new, since previously it was in 4). But we are allowed to put N in 5.

However, putting A in position 3 again would be inefficient because we already know it's not there. So we should try A in a different position.

So let's avoid position 3 for A and position 4 for N.

In ""PLAIN"", A is in position 3 -> not good.

Alternative: ""SNAIL"" -> S, N, A, I, L. 
- Positions: N in 1 (new), A in 3 (again, not good) -> same problem.

""MANGO"" -> M, A, N, G, O. 
- A in position 2 (new), N in position 3 (new, because previously it was in 4). 
- Avoids C, R, E. 
- This seems good: A is in 2 (not 3) and N is in 3 (not 4). We also test M, G, O.

But is ""MANGO"" a valid word? Yes.

Another option: ""PAINT"" -> P, A, I, N, T. 
- A in position 2 (new), N in position 4? But we must avoid N in position 4? Wait, no: the feedback said N is in the word but not in position 4. So we can try N in other positions, but we cannot put it in position 4 because we know it's not there. In ""PAINT"": 
  - P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). 
  - Here N is in position 4 again? That's the same position as before. We know it's not in position 4, so we would get a minus again? But we want to test new positions. So it's better to avoid position 4 for N.

Therefore, ""PAINT"" is not ideal because N is in position 4.

Similarly, we can try ""SAINT"" but S(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> same issue with N in 4.

So let's avoid position 4 for N and position 3 for A.

Another word: ""TANGY"" -> T, A, N, G, Y. 
- A in position 2 (new), N in position 3 (new). 
- Avoids C, R, E. 
- This is good.

But ""TANGY"" might be less common. ""MANGO"" is more common.

Another: ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y. But this doesn't have N. We must include N? Not necessarily, but we know the word has N, so if we don't include N, we might not get information about its position. Similarly for A.

It's better to include both A and N to get more information about their positions.

So words that include A and N, with A not in 3 and N not in 4.

Let me think of more:
- ""BALDY"" -> B, A, L, D, Y. No N.
- ""HANDY"" -> H, A, N, D, Y. 
  - Positions: H(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5). 
  - A in 2 (new), N in 3 (new). Avoids position 3 for A and position 4 for N. Also, we test H, D, Y.

This seems good.

- ""FANGS"" -> F, A, N, G, S. 
  - A in 2, N in 3. Also good.

I think ""HANDY"" is a valid word.

But let's choose one that has more common letters. ""MANGO"" is common and uses M, A, N, G, O.

Alternatively, ""PLANK"" -> P, L, A, N, K. 
- A in 3? Not allowed. We must avoid A in 3.

In ""PLANK"": A is in position 3 -> not good.

""SLANG"" -> S, L, A, N, G. 
- A in 3? Again, position 3 -> not good.

""ANGRY"" -> A, N, G, R, Y. But R is in the word? We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R is x). So we cannot use R.

So avoid R.

Therefore, ""MANGO"" seems a good choice: 
- M (new), A (position 2, new), N (position 3, new), G (new), O (new). 
- We avoid C, R, E.

We can also consider ""DAUNT"" -> D, A, U, N, T. 
- A in position 2, N in position 4? But we must avoid N in position 4. So not good.

""ADMIN"" -> A, D, M, I, N. 
- A in position 1 (new), N in position 5 (new). This is good. 
- Avoids C, R, E. 
- Tests A, D, M, I, N.

""ADMIN"" is a valid word (short for administer or administrator, but accepted as a word).

But ""ADMIN"" might be less common in everyday language. ""MANGO"" is more common.

Another: ""PAYNN"" -> not a word, duplicate N? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but typically we assume no duplicates unless feedback shows.

But we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

I think ""MANGO"" is a solid choice.

So I'll go with ""MANGO"".

But let's confirm: 
- M: not tested before -> we'll get feedback.
- A: in the word, but we are putting it in position 2 (previously it was in 3, so new position).
- N: in the word, putting in position 3 (previously in 4, so new position).
- G: new.
- O: new.

This will help us locate A and N and test three new letters.

Therefore, the second guess is ""MANGO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A and N **are** in the secret word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A is not in position 3, and N is not in position 4.

For the second guess:
- The word must include A and N (since they are in the secret word), but avoid C, R, and E.
- A should not be placed in position 3 (to test a new position), and N should not be placed in position 4.
- To maximize information, include new common letters (e.g., M, G, O) to test their presence.

A strong candidate is ""MANGO"":
- Places A in position 2 (new position to test).
- Places N in position 3 (new position to test).
- Avoids C, R, E, and includes new letters (M, G, O) for additional feedback.

2. Letters in the word: A, N, O
   - N is confirmed in position 3 (from MANGO feedback: N(✓) at position 3)
3. A is in the word but not in position 3 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from MANGO). So A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
4. O is in the word but not in position 5 (from MANGO).

Also, we know the word has 5 letters and we have 3 known letters: A, N, O. So we need to find two more letters.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, G, O. So we should avoid these except for A, N, O which are in the word.

But note: we have two positions for A and O to be placed, and two more letters to discover.

The known positions:
- Position 3: N (fixed)

So the word looks like: _ _ N _ _

Now, A cannot be in position 2 or 3. So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

But position 5: we know O is not in position 5, so O must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Also, we have two more letters to find, which are not in the set {C, R, E, M, G}.

Let's list the available positions for A and O:

- A: positions 1, 4, 5 (but note, if A is in position 5, then O cannot be in 5, which is already known)
- O: positions 1, 2, 4

We also need to consider that the word must have two more letters that we haven't tried yet (except A, N, O).

We have used: C, R, E, M, G (excluded) and A, N, O (included). So we can use any other letters of the alphabet.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to form a word that fits the pattern and tests new letters.

Given that N is fixed at position 3, the word is: _ _ N _ _

We know A is in the word and must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly, O is in the word and must be in 1, 2, or 4.

But note: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are open for A and O and the two new letters.

We must avoid placing A in 2 or 3 (already known) and O in 5 (known).

Possible scenarios:

- If A is in 1, then O can be in 2 or 4 (but not 5, and 3 is taken by N).
- If A is in 4, then O can be in 1 or 2.
- If A is in 5, then O can be in 1, 2, or 4.

But we don't know which, so we need to design a guess that can help disambiguate.

Moreover, we need to include two new letters to test.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have N in the third position and include A and O.

Pattern: _ _ N _ _

We can try to put A in position 1 and O in position 2? That would be: A O N _ _

But what words? AON?? Not common. ""AONIC"" is not common. ""AONIA"" is not common. So maybe not.

A in position 1 and O in position 4: A _ N O _

Words: ""ALONE"" -> but E is excluded (from first guess). E is not in the word.

""ATONE"" -> E is excluded.

""ABOON"" -> not common, and O is repeated? But we don't know about duplicates.

A in position 1 and O in position 5: A _ N _ O -> but O is in position 5, which we know is wrong (from MANGO feedback: O is not in position 5). So O cannot be in position 5. So this is invalid.

Therefore, A cannot be in position 1 if we want to put O in 5? But we know O is not in 5, so we cannot put O in 5. So A in position 1 must have O in 2 or 4.

But as above, words with A in 1 and O in 2: hard to find common words.

A in position 4: then word is _ _ N A _

O can be in 1 or 2.

If O in 1: O _ N A _

Words: ""OCTAN"" -> but C and T: C is excluded, so no. ""OPIAN"" -> O, P, I, A, N -> pattern: O P I A N -> positions: O(1), P(2), I(3) but position 3 is N, so not I. We need N in position 3.

The pattern is fixed: position 3 is N. So if O is in 1 and A in 4: O _ N A _

Words: ""OVINA"" -> not common. ""OLPAN"" -> not a word.

A in position 4 and O in position 2: _ O N A _

Words: ""BONA"" is 4 letters, we need 5. ""CONGA"" -> C excluded. ""DONNA"" -> duplicate N? But we don't know. ""DONNA"" has two N's. But our known letters: we have one N already in position 3, so if the word has two N's, that's possible. But in feedback, for MANGO, we had N in position 3 correct, but if there were another N, it might have been indicated? The feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we only had one N in the guess, and it was correct, we don't know if there is a duplicate.

But in CRANE, we had N in position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out duplicates.

So ""DONNA"" is a word: D, O, N, N, A -> but then positions: D(1), O(2), N(3), N(4), A(5). But we have A in position 5? But in this pattern we are considering A in position 4? Wait, no: in this scenario we are trying A in position 4? But in ""DONNA"", A is in position 5.

We are considering A in position 4? Then the word is _ _ N A _ -> so position 4 is A.

But in ""DONNA"", position 4 is N and position 5 is A. So that doesn't fit.

We need a word with pattern: _ O N A _ 

For example: ""TONAL"" -> T, O, N, A, L -> positions: T(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), L(5). This fits.

But we don't know if T, L are in the word? And we haven't tested them.

Also, O is in position 2, which is allowed.

A is in position 4, which is a new position (previously A was in 3 and 2, both wrong).

Similarly, O is in position 2, which is new (previously O was in 5, which was wrong).

So ""TONAL"" could be a candidate.

But we have to check if T and L are allowed: we haven't used them, and they are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, E, M, G.

T and L are not in that set.

Another word: ""SONAR"" -> but R is excluded.

""BONUS"" -> S is new, but U is new, but pattern: B(1), O(2), N(3), U(4), S(5). But we don't have A in this word? But we know A must be in the word. So we must include A.

So we cannot use ""BONUS"" because it doesn't have A.

We must include A, N, O.

So back to ""TONAL"": it has T, O, N, A, L -> includes A, N, O.

Now, what about A in position 5? We haven't considered that.

If A is in position 5: then word is _ _ N _ A

O must be in 1, 2, or 4.

But O cannot be in 5 (taken by A) and not in 5 anyway (from feedback).

So O in 1, 2, or 4.

If O in 1: O _ N _ A -> words: ""OCTNA"" not a word. ""OPINA"" -> not common.

If O in 2: _ O N _ A -> words: ""CONDA"" -> C excluded. ""BONZA"" -> B, O, N, Z, A -> pattern: B(1), O(2), N(3), Z(4), A(5). This is a word (meaning excellent). But Z is uncommon.

If O in 4: _ _ N O A -> words: ""PINOA"" not common. ""MINOA"" -> M excluded.

So ""TONAL"" seems a reasonable choice.

But we have another possibility: A in position 1? We had trouble finding words, but let's try again.

A in 1, O in 4: A _ N O _

Words: ""ALONE"" -> E excluded. ""ATONE"" -> E excluded. ""ABOON"" -> not common. ""ADORN"" -> but R excluded. ""AEONS"" -> E and S: E excluded. So hard.

A in 1, O in 2: A O N _ _ -> ""AONIE"" not common. ""AONIC"" not common.

So it seems difficult to have A in position 1.

Therefore, the most plausible is A in position 4 or 5.

We have ""TONAL"" for A in position 4.

But what about A in position 5? We had ""BONZA"", but Z is uncommon. Another word: ""DONNA"" has A in 5, but then N in 4? But we have N in position 3, so if there is another N, it's possible. ""DONNA"": D(1), O(2), N(3), N(4), A(5). But in this case, we have two N's? Then in the feedback for CRANE, we had N in position 4 marked as present but wrong position. If the word is ""DONNA"", then N is in position 3 and 4. So when we guessed CRANE with N in position 4, it should have been marked as present (which it was) but wrong position (because it's also in 3, but the feedback doesn't specify which occurrence). Similarly, in MANGO, we had N in position 3 correct, and if there is another N, it wasn't tested because we only put one N.

But in ""DONNA"", A is in position 5, which is allowed? But from MANGO feedback, O is not in position 5, but A could be.

However, we don't have information about position 5 for A.

But in ""DONNA"", we have O in position 2, which is allowed.

But we need to test new letters. In ""DONNA"", we use D and O (O is known) and A and N (known) and another N. But D is new.

But we are missing the letter O? ""DONNA"" has O in position 2.

But we already know O is in the word, so we can use it.

But we want to test new letters. In ""DONNA"", we test D and the duplicate N possibility.

But let's see if there are better words.

Another word with A in position 5: ""PIANO"" -> P, I, A, N, O -> but pattern: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5). But we need N in position 3, not 4. So not.

""PIANO"" has N in 4, but we know N is in 3.

So not.

Therefore, ""TONAL"" seems a good candidate.

But in ""TONAL"", we have:
- T: new
- O: in word, placed in position 2 (previously in 5, so new position)
- N: correct in position 3
- A: in word, placed in position 4 (previously in 3 and 2, both wrong, so new)
- L: new

This tests T and L, and also checks if A is in 4 and O in 2.

If the word is ""TONAL"", then we might get feedback that helps.

But we must consider that the secret word might not have T or L.

Another possibility: A in position 5 and O in position 1: O _ N _ A

Words: ""OCTNA"" no. ""OPINA"" no. ""OVINE"" -> E excluded. Not many.

O in position 1 and A in position 4: O _ N A _ -> ""OPAL"" is 4 letters. ""OVARY"" -> V, A, R but R excluded. ""OLEIN"" -> E excluded.

So not great.

Therefore, I think ""TONAL"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another word with pattern _ _ N A _ and O in position 2: ""CONGA"" -> C excluded. ""DONAH"" -> not common. ""HONAN"" -> H, O, N, A, N -> duplicate N? H(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), N(5). This is a word (a type of silk). And it has A in 4 and O in 2.

But we have duplicate N? Then in the first guess, when we had N in position 4, it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""HONAN"", N is in position 3 and 5, so position 4 is A, so N in position 4 is not present, but we had a minus for N in CRANE? In CRANE, N was in position 4 and we got a minus, meaning there is an N but not in position 4. In ""HONAN"", there is an N in position 3 and 5, but not 4, so that matches. And in MANGO, we had N in position 3 correct, which is one of the N's.

But we don't know if there is a duplicate. So ""HONAN"" is possible.

But we have to test new letters. In ""HONAN"", we test H and the duplicate N possibility.

But H is a common letter.

Similarly, we have ""TONAL"" testing T and L.

Both are valid.

But ""TONAL"" might be more common.

Another word: ""FINAL"" -> F, I, N, A, L -> pattern: F(1), I(2), N(3), A(4), L(5). This fits: A in 4, and we test F and I.

But we don't have O? But we know O is in the word. ""FINAL"" does not have O, so it cannot be the word because O is in the secret word.

We must include O.

So we cannot use ""FINAL"".

Similarly, ""PENAL"" -> E excluded and no O.

So we must have a word with A, N, O.

Therefore, ""TONAL"" and ""HONAN"" are candidates.

But ""HONAN"" has duplicate N, which might be less likely, but possible.

To avoid assuming duplicates, maybe ""TONAL"" is better.

Another word: ""KOINE"" -> E excluded.

""LOHAN"" -> L, O, H, A, N -> pattern: L(1), O(2), H(3), A(4), N(5). But we need N in position 3, not 5. So not.

The pattern must have N in position 3.

So only the third letter is fixed as N.

Therefore, the word must be: _ _ N ? ? 

With A and O in the remaining positions, but not A in 2 or 3, and not O in 5.

So positions 1,2,4,5 for the other letters, with A and O among them.

We have two more letters to find.

In ""TONAL"": positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L -> so O in 2, A in 4.

In ""HONAN"": 1:H, 2:O, 3:N, 4:A, 5:N -> O in 2, A in 4, and duplicate N.

Another word: ""CANON"" -> C excluded.

""WOMAN"" -> W, O, M, A, N -> but M is excluded (from MANGO: M(x)), and also pattern: W(1), O(2), M(3) but position 3 is N, not M. So not.

""DOZEN"" -> E excluded and no A.

So I think ""TONAL"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I will guess ""TONAL"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the word is, say, ""TONAL"", then we might get some correct.

But if not, we get information about T, O, A, L.

Specifically, O is in position 2? We know O is in the word, but we are testing if it is in position 2.

Similarly, A in position 4.

And T and L are new.

So it should be informative.

We could choose a word that has A in position 1 or 5, but we couldn't find common words.

Another idea: A in position 5 and O in position 1: O _ N _ A

Words: ""ORINA"" -> not common, and R excluded? ""ORINA"" has R. R is excluded.

""OLENA"" -> E excluded.

So not.

Therefore, I go with ""TONAL"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, R, and E are not in the word. A and N are in the word but not in positions 3 or 4, respectively.
- **Guess 2 (MANGO)**: M and G are not in the word. A is in the word but not in position 2. N is correct and in position 3. O is in the word but not in position 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed Letters**: 
  - N is fixed in **position 3** (from MANGO feedback: N(✓)).
  - A and O are in the word, but their positions are unknown.
    - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from CRANE and MANGO feedback).
    - O cannot be in position 5 (from MANGO feedback).
- **Excluded Letters**: C, R, E, M, G (cannot appear in the word).
- **Word Pattern**: The secret word is `_ _ N _ _`, with N in position 3.
- **Remaining Tasks**: 
  - Find positions for A (must be in 1, 4, or 5) and O (must be in 1, 2, or 4).
  - Identify two new letters (not tested: e.g., B, D, F, H, I, L, P, S, T, U, etc.).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test a word that:
  - Fits the pattern `_ _ N _ _`.
  - Places A and O in new, untested positions to narrow down possibilities.
  - Uses common, high-frequency letters to maximize information gain.
- **Chosen Word: TONAL**:
  - **T** (new letter, tests position 1).
  - **O** (in word, tests position 2—previously untested for O).
  - **N** (confirmed in position 3).
  - **A** (in word, tests position 4—previously untested for A).
  - **L** (new letter, tests position 5).
- **Why TONAL?**
  - It efficiently tests A in position 4 and O in position 2, which are valid positions based on constraints.
  - Uses common consonants (T, L) to cover new ground.
  - Avoids excluded letters and repeats (all letters are distinct).
  - If incorrect, the feedback will reveal positions for A/O and presence of T/L, significantly reducing possibilities.

<guess>TONAL</guess>",TONAL,"We have two sets of feedback:

From Guess 1 (CRANE):
- C: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- A: in word, but not in position 3 (-)
- N: in word, but not in position 4 (-)
- E: not in word (x)

From Guess 2 (MANGO):
- M: not in word (x)
- A: in word, but not in position 2 (-)  [since it's marked as -]
- N: in word and in the correct position (✓) at position 3
- G: not in word (x)
- O: in word, but not in position 5 (-)

So, combining the information:

1. Letters not in the word: C, R, E, M, G
2. Letters in the word: A, N, O
   - N is confirmed in position 3 (from MANGO feedback: N(✓) at position 3)
3. A is in the word but not in position 3 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from MANGO). So A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
4. O is in the word but not in position 5 (from MANGO).

Also, we know the word has 5 letters and we have 3 known letters: A, N, O. So we need to find two more letters.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, G, O. So we should avoid these except for A, N, O which are in the word.

But note: we have two positions for A and O to be placed, and two more letters to discover.

The known positions:
- Position 3: N (fixed)

So the word looks like: _ _ N _ _

Now, A cannot be in position 2 or 3. So A must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

But position 5: we know O is not in position 5, so O must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Also, we have two more letters to find, which are not in the set {C, R, E, M, G}.

Let's list the available positions for A and O:

- A: positions 1, 4, 5 (but note, if A is in position 5, then O cannot be in 5, which is already known)
- O: positions 1, 2, 4

We also need to consider that the word must have two more letters that we haven't tried yet (except A, N, O).

We have used: C, R, E, M, G (excluded) and A, N, O (included). So we can use any other letters of the alphabet.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to form a word that fits the pattern and tests new letters.

Given that N is fixed at position 3, the word is: _ _ N _ _

We know A is in the word and must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Similarly, O is in the word and must be in 1, 2, or 4.

But note: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are open for A and O and the two new letters.

We must avoid placing A in 2 or 3 (already known) and O in 5 (known).

Possible scenarios:

- If A is in 1, then O can be in 2 or 4 (but not 5, and 3 is taken by N).
- If A is in 4, then O can be in 1 or 2.
- If A is in 5, then O can be in 1, 2, or 4.

But we don't know which, so we need to design a guess that can help disambiguate.

Moreover, we need to include two new letters to test.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have N in the third position and include A and O.

Pattern: _ _ N _ _

We can try to put A in position 1 and O in position 2? That would be: A O N _ _

But what words? AON?? Not common. ""AONIC"" is not common. ""AONIA"" is not common. So maybe not.

A in position 1 and O in position 4: A _ N O _

Words: ""ALONE"" -> but E is excluded (from first guess). E is not in the word.

""ATONE"" -> E is excluded.

""ABOON"" -> not common, and O is repeated? But we don't know about duplicates.

A in position 1 and O in position 5: A _ N _ O -> but O is in position 5, which we know is wrong (from MANGO feedback: O is not in position 5). So O cannot be in position 5. So this is invalid.

Therefore, A cannot be in position 1 if we want to put O in 5? But we know O is not in 5, so we cannot put O in 5. So A in position 1 must have O in 2 or 4.

But as above, words with A in 1 and O in 2: hard to find common words.

A in position 4: then word is _ _ N A _

O can be in 1 or 2.

If O in 1: O _ N A _

Words: ""OCTAN"" -> but C and T: C is excluded, so no. ""OPIAN"" -> O, P, I, A, N -> pattern: O P I A N -> positions: O(1), P(2), I(3) but position 3 is N, so not I. We need N in position 3.

The pattern is fixed: position 3 is N. So if O is in 1 and A in 4: O _ N A _

Words: ""OVINA"" -> not common. ""OLPAN"" -> not a word.

A in position 4 and O in position 2: _ O N A _

Words: ""BONA"" is 4 letters, we need 5. ""CONGA"" -> C excluded. ""DONNA"" -> duplicate N? But we don't know. ""DONNA"" has two N's. But our known letters: we have one N already in position 3, so if the word has two N's, that's possible. But in feedback, for MANGO, we had N in position 3 correct, but if there were another N, it might have been indicated? The feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we only had one N in the guess, and it was correct, we don't know if there is a duplicate.

But in CRANE, we had N in position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out duplicates.

So ""DONNA"" is a word: D, O, N, N, A -> but then positions: D(1), O(2), N(3), N(4), A(5). But we have A in position 5? But in this pattern we are considering A in position 4? Wait, no: in this scenario we are trying A in position 4? But in ""DONNA"", A is in position 5.

We are considering A in position 4? Then the word is _ _ N A _ -> so position 4 is A.

But in ""DONNA"", position 4 is N and position 5 is A. So that doesn't fit.

We need a word with pattern: _ O N A _ 

For example: ""TONAL"" -> T, O, N, A, L -> positions: T(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), L(5). This fits.

But we don't know if T, L are in the word? And we haven't tested them.

Also, O is in position 2, which is allowed.

A is in position 4, which is a new position (previously A was in 3 and 2, both wrong).

Similarly, O is in position 2, which is new (previously O was in 5, which was wrong).

So ""TONAL"" could be a candidate.

But we have to check if T and L are allowed: we haven't used them, and they are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, E, M, G.

T and L are not in that set.

Another word: ""SONAR"" -> but R is excluded.

""BONUS"" -> S is new, but U is new, but pattern: B(1), O(2), N(3), U(4), S(5). But we don't have A in this word? But we know A must be in the word. So we must include A.

So we cannot use ""BONUS"" because it doesn't have A.

We must include A, N, O.

So back to ""TONAL"": it has T, O, N, A, L -> includes A, N, O.

Now, what about A in position 5? We haven't considered that.

If A is in position 5: then word is _ _ N _ A

O must be in 1, 2, or 4.

But O cannot be in 5 (taken by A) and not in 5 anyway (from feedback).

So O in 1, 2, or 4.

If O in 1: O _ N _ A -> words: ""OCTNA"" not a word. ""OPINA"" -> not common.

If O in 2: _ O N _ A -> words: ""CONDA"" -> C excluded. ""BONZA"" -> B, O, N, Z, A -> pattern: B(1), O(2), N(3), Z(4), A(5). This is a word (meaning excellent). But Z is uncommon.

If O in 4: _ _ N O A -> words: ""PINOA"" not common. ""MINOA"" -> M excluded.

So ""TONAL"" seems a reasonable choice.

But we have another possibility: A in position 1? We had trouble finding words, but let's try again.

A in 1, O in 4: A _ N O _

Words: ""ALONE"" -> E excluded. ""ATONE"" -> E excluded. ""ABOON"" -> not common. ""ADORN"" -> but R excluded. ""AEONS"" -> E and S: E excluded. So hard.

A in 1, O in 2: A O N _ _ -> ""AONIE"" not common. ""AONIC"" not common.

So it seems difficult to have A in position 1.

Therefore, the most plausible is A in position 4 or 5.

We have ""TONAL"" for A in position 4.

But what about A in position 5? We had ""BONZA"", but Z is uncommon. Another word: ""DONNA"" has A in 5, but then N in 4? But we have N in position 3, so if there is another N, it's possible. ""DONNA"": D(1), O(2), N(3), N(4), A(5). But in this case, we have two N's? Then in the feedback for CRANE, we had N in position 4 marked as present but wrong position. If the word is ""DONNA"", then N is in position 3 and 4. So when we guessed CRANE with N in position 4, it should have been marked as present (which it was) but wrong position (because it's also in 3, but the feedback doesn't specify which occurrence). Similarly, in MANGO, we had N in position 3 correct, and if there is another N, it wasn't tested because we only put one N.

But in ""DONNA"", A is in position 5, which is allowed? But from MANGO feedback, O is not in position 5, but A could be.

However, we don't have information about position 5 for A.

But in ""DONNA"", we have O in position 2, which is allowed.

But we need to test new letters. In ""DONNA"", we use D and O (O is known) and A and N (known) and another N. But D is new.

But we are missing the letter O? ""DONNA"" has O in position 2.

But we already know O is in the word, so we can use it.

But we want to test new letters. In ""DONNA"", we test D and the duplicate N possibility.

But let's see if there are better words.

Another word with A in position 5: ""PIANO"" -> P, I, A, N, O -> but pattern: P(1), I(2), A(3), N(4), O(5). But we need N in position 3, not 4. So not.

""PIANO"" has N in 4, but we know N is in 3.

So not.

Therefore, ""TONAL"" seems a good candidate.

But in ""TONAL"", we have:
- T: new
- O: in word, placed in position 2 (previously in 5, so new position)
- N: correct in position 3
- A: in word, placed in position 4 (previously in 3 and 2, both wrong, so new)
- L: new

This tests T and L, and also checks if A is in 4 and O in 2.

If the word is ""TONAL"", then we might get feedback that helps.

But we must consider that the secret word might not have T or L.

Another possibility: A in position 5 and O in position 1: O _ N _ A

Words: ""OCTNA"" no. ""OPINA"" no. ""OVINE"" -> E excluded. Not many.

O in position 1 and A in position 4: O _ N A _ -> ""OPAL"" is 4 letters. ""OVARY"" -> V, A, R but R excluded. ""OLEIN"" -> E excluded.

So not great.

Therefore, I think ""TONAL"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another word with pattern _ _ N A _ and O in position 2: ""CONGA"" -> C excluded. ""DONAH"" -> not common. ""HONAN"" -> H, O, N, A, N -> duplicate N? H(1), O(2), N(3), A(4), N(5). This is a word (a type of silk). And it has A in 4 and O in 2.

But we have duplicate N? Then in the first guess, when we had N in position 4, it was marked as present but wrong position. In ""HONAN"", N is in position 3 and 5, so position 4 is A, so N in position 4 is not present, but we had a minus for N in CRANE? In CRANE, N was in position 4 and we got a minus, meaning there is an N but not in position 4. In ""HONAN"", there is an N in position 3 and 5, but not 4, so that matches. And in MANGO, we had N in position 3 correct, which is one of the N's.

But we don't know if there is a duplicate. So ""HONAN"" is possible.

But we have to test new letters. In ""HONAN"", we test H and the duplicate N possibility.

But H is a common letter.

Similarly, we have ""TONAL"" testing T and L.

Both are valid.

But ""TONAL"" might be more common.

Another word: ""FINAL"" -> F, I, N, A, L -> pattern: F(1), I(2), N(3), A(4), L(5). This fits: A in 4, and we test F and I.

But we don't have O? But we know O is in the word. ""FINAL"" does not have O, so it cannot be the word because O is in the secret word.

We must include O.

So we cannot use ""FINAL"".

Similarly, ""PENAL"" -> E excluded and no O.

So we must have a word with A, N, O.

Therefore, ""TONAL"" and ""HONAN"" are candidates.

But ""HONAN"" has duplicate N, which might be less likely, but possible.

To avoid assuming duplicates, maybe ""TONAL"" is better.

Another word: ""KOINE"" -> E excluded.

""LOHAN"" -> L, O, H, A, N -> pattern: L(1), O(2), H(3), A(4), N(5). But we need N in position 3, not 5. So not.

The pattern must have N in position 3.

So only the third letter is fixed as N.

Therefore, the word must be: _ _ N ? ? 

With A and O in the remaining positions, but not A in 2 or 3, and not O in 5.

So positions 1,2,4,5 for the other letters, with A and O among them.

We have two more letters to find.

In ""TONAL"": positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L -> so O in 2, A in 4.

In ""HONAN"": 1:H, 2:O, 3:N, 4:A, 5:N -> O in 2, A in 4, and duplicate N.

Another word: ""CANON"" -> C excluded.

""WOMAN"" -> W, O, M, A, N -> but M is excluded (from MANGO: M(x)), and also pattern: W(1), O(2), M(3) but position 3 is N, not M. So not.

""DOZEN"" -> E excluded and no A.

So I think ""TONAL"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I will guess ""TONAL"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the word is, say, ""TONAL"", then we might get some correct.

But if not, we get information about T, O, A, L.

Specifically, O is in position 2? We know O is in the word, but we are testing if it is in position 2.

Similarly, A in position 4.

And T and L are new.

So it should be informative.

We could choose a word that has A in position 1 or 5, but we couldn't find common words.

Another idea: A in position 5 and O in position 1: O _ N _ A

Words: ""ORINA"" -> not common, and R excluded? ""ORINA"" has R. R is excluded.

""OLENA"" -> E excluded.

So not.

Therefore, I go with ""TONAL"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, R, and E are not in the word. A and N are in the word but not in positions 3 or 4, respectively.
- **Guess 2 (MANGO)**: M and G are not in the word. A is in the word but not in position 2. N is correct and in position 3. O is in the word but not in position 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed Letters**: 
  - N is fixed in **position 3** (from MANGO feedback: N(✓)).
  - A and O are in the word, but their positions are unknown.
    - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from CRANE and MANGO feedback).
    - O cannot be in position 5 (from MANGO feedback).
- **Excluded Letters**: C, R, E, M, G (cannot appear in the word).
- **Word Pattern**: The secret word is `_ _ N _ _`, with N in position 3.
- **Remaining Tasks**: 
  - Find positions for A (must be in 1, 4, or 5) and O (must be in 1, 2, or 4).
  - Identify two new letters (not tested: e.g., B, D, F, H, I, L, P, S, T, U, etc.).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test a word that:
  - Fits the pattern `_ _ N _ _`.
  - Places A and O in new, untested positions to narrow down possibilities.
  - Uses common, high-frequency letters to maximize information gain.
- **Chosen Word: TONAL**:
  - **T** (new letter, tests position 1).
  - **O** (in word, tests position 2—previously untested for O).
  - **N** (confirmed in position 3).
  - **A** (in word, tests position 4—previously untested for A).
  - **L** (new letter, tests position 5).
- **Why TONAL?**
  - It efficiently tests A in position 4 and O in position 2, which are valid positions based on constraints.
  - Uses common consonants (T, L) to cover new ground.
  - Avoids excluded letters and repeats (all letters are distinct).
  - If incorrect, the feedback will reveal positions for A/O and presence of T/L, significantly reducing possibilities.",Guess 3: TONAL -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(✓) N(✓) A(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
