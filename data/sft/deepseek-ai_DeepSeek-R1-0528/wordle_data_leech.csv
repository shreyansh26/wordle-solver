We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all frequent in English words.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: x (A is not in the secret word)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: - (E is in the secret word but in the wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters C and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, C was in position 1, so it must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5 in the secret word.
   E was in position 5, so it must be in one of positions 1,2,3,4 in the secret word.
 - The secret word does not contain R, A, or N.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Does not contain R, A, or N (because they are not in the secret word).
 2. Contains C and E, but not in the same positions as in ""crane"" (i.e., C cannot be at position 1, E cannot be at position 5).
 3. We might also want to include other common letters to test.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible: B, D, H, I, L, O, S, T, U, etc.

 We know the word has 5 letters and must include C and E.

 Since C cannot be at position 1, and E cannot be at position 5, we can try to place C in a different position and E in a different position.

 Also, note that the word does not have R, A, N.

 Let's try to form a word that has C and E, and three new letters.

 Possibilities: We can try words like ""CLOSE"", ""SCENE"", but note:
 - ""SCENE"" has two E's? But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one E and one C, but that doesn't rule out duplicates. But since we only have one E marked, if the word had two E's, we would have seen at least one E in the correct position or another E marked? Not necessarily: because the E in position 5 was marked as present but wrong position, so there could be another E that we haven't seen.

 However, to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates until we have more information.

 We also want to test new letters.

 Let's try to think of words that have C and E, and avoid R, A, N.

 Some options:
 - ""CLOSE"": C at position 1? But wait, in ""crane"", C was at position 1 and we got a '-' meaning C is in the word but not at position 1. So we cannot put C at position 1 again. Therefore, ""CLOSE"" is invalid because it puts C at position 1.

 We must avoid putting C at position 1 and E at position 5.

 Let's try ""SCENT"": 
   S at 1, C at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5.
 But wait, we know N is not in the word (from feedback: N was marked as 'x'). So we cannot use N.

 Another option: ""CHOSE"": 
   C at 1? Again, position 1 is not allowed for C.

 We need to put C in a position other than 1. So let's try to put C at position 2,3,4, or 5.

 Similarly, E cannot be at position 5, so we can put E at 1,2,3, or 4.

 Example: ""SPICE"": 
   S at 1, P at 2, I at 3, C at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 How about ""SPICE"" but rearrange? We need to form a valid word.

 Another idea: ""CEILS"" (an old word for chisels? but might not be common) or ""CELEB"" (not 5 letters). 

 Let's think of more common words.

 How about ""SCORE""? But we know R is not in the word (from feedback: R was marked as 'x'), so we cannot use R.

 How about ""SCOPE""? 
   S at 1, C at 2, O at 3, P at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 We need to avoid E at position 5.

 How about ""EPICS""? 
   E at 1, P at 2, I at 3, C at 4, S at 5.
 This word: 
   E is at position 1 (which is allowed because previously E was at 5 and now it's at 1, which is different and not the same as the previous position for E? Actually, the feedback only said that E is not at position 5, so position 1 is fine for E).
   C is at position 4 (which is not position 1, so that's allowed).

 Also, the letters are E, P, I, C, S. None of these are R, A, or N.

 So ""epics"" is a valid word? Let me confirm: yes, ""epics"" is a word (meaning heroic deeds or grand events).

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPICE"" but with E not at 5? We can't because the word ""spice"" ends with E.

 Another option: ""CLIME"" (meaning a region or climate? but not very common). 

 Or ""CELLO"": but that has two L's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, C is at position 1 again -> not allowed.

 How about ""OUNCE""? But we know N is not in the word (from feedback: N was 'x'), so we cannot use N.

 Another idea: ""DUCHY"": 
   D at 1, U at 2, C at 3, H at 4, Y at 5.
 This uses C at position 3 (which is allowed) and does not use E? But we know E is in the word. So we must include E.

 Therefore, we must have a word that includes both C and E.

 Let me try to list words that have C and E, and avoid R, A, N, and with C not at 1 and E not at 5.

 Possibilities:
 - ""PIECE"": but has two E's? And C at position 3? Also, E at position 5 is not allowed. So we cannot use ""PIECE"" because E is at 5.

 - ""CHASE"": but has A? We know A is not in the word.

 - ""THECE"" (not common).

 - ""EXCEL"": 
   E at 1, X at 2, C at 3, E at 4, L at 5.
   This has two E's? But that's okay. 
   E at position 1: allowed (since previously E was at 5, so position 1 is new).
   C at position 3: allowed (not position 1).
   Also, the word has E at position 4 and 1? But we don't know if the secret word has two E's. 
   However, we must note that the feedback for the first guess only showed one E (at position 5) as present. If the secret word has two E's, then we would have seen two '-' for two E's? Not necessarily: because if one E was in the correct position, it would have been marked as correct. But in our case, the E at position 5 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that there is at least one E in the word that is not at position 5. There could be another E that we haven't guessed.

 But in ""excel"", we have E at position 1 and 4. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. However, we are allowed to guess words with duplicate letters to test.

 But let's check the letters: E, X, C, E, L. We are including E and C, and new letters: X, L. Also, no R, A, N.

 However, note that the first guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has at least one E that is not at position 5. If we put E at position 1 and 4, that's acceptable.

 But we must be cautious: if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E's in ""excel"" will be marked as present and the other as absent? Actually, the feedback rules: for each letter, if it is in the word, then we mark it as present (either correct position or wrong position) for each occurrence? But the secret word might have only one E, so if we guess two E's, one of them might be marked as present and the other as absent? Actually, the feedback is per letter in the guess. For each letter, if the letter is in the secret word and in the correct position, we mark it with a check. If it is in the secret word but not in the correct position, we mark it with a dash. If it is not in the secret word, we mark it with an x.

 However, if the secret word has only one E, and we guess two E's, then one of the E's (the one that is in the correct position) would be marked as check, and the other E (if it is in a position that the secret word does not have an E) would be marked as x? Or if the secret word has one E, and we have two E's in the guess, then the one that is in the correct position would be check, and the other would be x. If neither is in the correct position, then one of them would be dash (if the secret word has one E) and the other would be x? Actually, the rule is: the feedback is independent per letter? But no, the feedback accounts for the frequency. For example, if the secret word has one E and we guess two E's, then one of the E's (the one that matches the position of the E in the secret word) would be check, and the other would be x. If neither matches the position, then the first E (or the one that the game considers) might get the dash and the other x? Actually, the standard Wordle rules: the feedback is given by first marking the exact matches, then the remaining letters in the guess that are in the secret word but not matched are marked as dashes, but only up to the frequency in the secret word.

 So if the secret word has one E, and we have two E's in the guess, then one of them (if it is in the correct position) would be check, and the other would be x. If neither is in the correct position, then one of them (the first occurrence? or arbitrary?) would be dash and the other x? Actually, the game doesn't assign by order of the guess but by the secret word: it will mark the exact matches first, then for the remaining letters in the guess, if the letter is in the secret word but not yet matched (and not over the frequency), it gets a dash.

 So to avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid duplicate letters for now.

 Therefore, let's try to find a word that has C and E, and without duplicate letters, and without R, A, N, and with C not at 1 and E not at 5.

 How about ""CLUED"": 
   C at 1? Not allowed.

 How about ""SCREW"": but has R and we know R is not in the word.

 How about ""SLEPT"": but no C? We must include C.

 Another idea: ""SPECK"": 
   S at 1, P at 2, E at 3, C at 4, K at 5.
   This has E at position 3 (allowed) and C at position 4 (allowed). 
   Letters: S, P, E, C, K -> no R, A, N.

 But note: we are including K, which is a new letter.

 Is ""SPECK"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""SPICE"" but we cannot because E is at 5? But in ""SPECK"", E is at 3 and C at 4, and K at 5. So that's acceptable.

 So let's go with ""SPECK"".

 We can also consider ""CHECK"", but that has two C's? And C at position 1? Not allowed.

 Therefore, I choose ""SPECK"".

 But wait, we have to consider: the feedback for the first guess said that C is in the word but not at position 1. In ""SPECK"", C is at position 4, which is fine. E is at position 3, which is not position 5, so that's fine.

 So our next guess: ""SPECK""

<guess>speck</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (marked with `-`).
- R, A, and N are not in the secret word (marked with `x`).

For the next guess:
- Must include C and E (since they are confirmed present).
- C cannot be in position 1 (as per feedback).
- E cannot be in position 5 (as per feedback).
- Cannot include R, A, or N (as they are absent).
- Should prioritize common letters to maximize information.

The word ""SPECK"" meets all criteria:
- S (position 1), P (position 2), E (position 3), C (position 4), K (position 5).
- C is in position 4 (not 1), E is in position 3 (not 5).
- No R, A, or N.
- Tests new common letters: S, P, K.

<guess>speck</guess>",speck,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: x (A is not in the secret word)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: - (E is in the secret word but in the wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters C and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, C was in position 1, so it must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5 in the secret word.
   E was in position 5, so it must be in one of positions 1,2,3,4 in the secret word.
 - The secret word does not contain R, A, or N.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Does not contain R, A, or N (because they are not in the secret word).
 2. Contains C and E, but not in the same positions as in ""crane"" (i.e., C cannot be at position 1, E cannot be at position 5).
 3. We might also want to include other common letters to test.

 Since C cannot be at position 1, and E cannot be at position 5, we can try to place C in a different position and E in a different position.

 Also, note that the word does not have R, A, N.

 Let's try to form a word that has C and E, and three new letters.

 - ""SCENE"" has two E's? But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one E and one C, but that doesn't rule out duplicates.

Not necessarily: because the E in position 5 was marked as present but wrong position, so there could be another E that we haven't seen.

 However, to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates until we have more information.

 We also want to test new letters.

 Some options:
 - ""CLOSE"": C at position 1? But wait, in ""crane"", C was at position 1 and we got a '-' meaning C is in the word but not at position 1. So we cannot put C at position 1 again. Therefore, ""CLOSE"" is invalid because it puts C at position 1.

 We must avoid putting C at position 1 and E at position 5.

 Let's try ""SCENT"": 
   S at 1, C at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5.
 But wait, we know N is not in the word (from feedback: N was marked as 'x'). So we cannot use N.

 Another option: ""CHOSE"": 
   C at 1? Again, position 1 is not allowed for C.

 We need to put C in a position other than 1. So let's try to put C at position 2,3,4, or 5.

 Similarly, E cannot be at position 5, so we can put E at 1,2,3, or 4.

 Example: ""SPICE"": 
   S at 1, P at 2, I at 3, C at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 How about ""SPICE"" but rearrange? We need to form a valid word.

 We need to avoid E at position 5.

 How about ""EPICS""? 
   E at 1, P at 2, I at 3, C at 4, S at 5.

   E is at position 1 (which is allowed because previously E was at 5 and now it's at 1, which is different and not the same as the previous position for E? Actually, the feedback only said that E is not at position 5, so position 1 is fine for E).

 So ""epics"" is a valid word? Let me confirm: yes, ""epics"" is a word (meaning heroic deeds or grand events).

 This uses C at position 3 (which is allowed) and does not use E? But we know E is in the word. So we must include E.

 Therefore, we must have a word that includes both C and E.

 Let me try to list words that have C and E, and avoid R, A, N, and with C not at 1 and E not at 5.

 Possibilities:
 - ""PIECE"": but has two E's? And C at position 3? Also, E at position 5 is not allowed. So we cannot use ""PIECE"" because E is at 5.

 - ""CHASE"": but has A? We know A is not in the word.

 - ""THECE"" (not common).

 - ""EXCEL"": 
   E at 1, X at 2, C at 3, E at 4, L at 5.
   This has two E's? But that's okay. 
   E at position 1: allowed (since previously E was at 5, so position 1 is new).
   C at position 3: allowed (not position 1).
   Also, the word has E at position 4 and 1? But we don't know if the secret word has two E's. 
   However, we must note that the feedback for the first guess only showed one E (at position 5) as present. If the secret word has two E's, then we would have seen two '-' for two E's? Not necessarily: because if one E was in the correct position, it would have been marked as correct. But in our case, the E at position 5 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that there is at least one E in the word that is not at position 5. There could be another E that we haven't guessed.

 But in ""excel"", we have E at position 1 and 4. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. However, we are allowed to guess words with duplicate letters to test.

 But let's check the letters: E, X, C, E, L. We are including E and C, and new letters: X, L. Also, no R, A, N.

 However, note that the first guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has at least one E that is not at position 5. If we put E at position 1 and 4, that's acceptable.

 How about ""SLEPT"": but no C? We must include C.

 Another idea: ""SPECK"": 
   S at 1, P at 2, E at 3, C at 4, K at 5.
   This has E at position 3 (allowed) and C at position 4 (allowed). 
   Letters: S, P, E, C, K -> no R, A, N.

 But note: we are including K, which is a new letter.

 Is ""SPECK"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""SPICE"" but we cannot because E is at 5? But in ""SPECK"", E is at 3 and C at 4, and K at 5. So that's acceptable.

 So let's go with ""SPECK"".

 We can also consider ""CHECK"", but that has two C's? And C at position 1? Not allowed.

 Therefore, I choose ""SPECK"".

 But wait, we have to consider: the feedback for the first guess said that C is in the word but not at position 1. In ""SPECK"", C is at position 4, which is fine. E is at position 3, which is not position 5, so that's fine.

 So our next guess: ""SPECK""

<guess>speck</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (marked with `-`).
- R, A, and N are not in the secret word (marked with `x`).

For the next guess:
- Must include C and E (since they are confirmed present).
- C cannot be in position 1 (as per feedback).
- E cannot be in position 5 (as per feedback).
- Cannot include R, A, or N (as they are absent).
- Should prioritize common letters to maximize information.

The word ""SPECK"" meets all criteria:
- S (position 1), P (position 2), E (position 3), C (position 4), K (position 5).
- C is in position 4 (not 1), E is in position 3 (not 5).
- No R, A, or N.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,leech,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all frequent in English words.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: x (A is not in the secret word)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: - (E is in the secret word but in the wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters C and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, C was in position 1, so it must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5 in the secret word.
   E was in position 5, so it must be in one of positions 1,2,3,4 in the secret word.
 - The secret word does not contain R, A, or N.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Does not contain R, A, or N (because they are not in the secret word).
 2. Contains C and E, but not in the same positions as in ""crane"" (i.e., C cannot be at position 1, E cannot be at position 5).
 3. We might also want to include other common letters to test.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible: B, D, H, I, L, O, S, T, U, etc.

 We know the word has 5 letters and must include C and E.

 Since C cannot be at position 1, and E cannot be at position 5, we can try to place C in a different position and E in a different position.

 Also, note that the word does not have R, A, N.

 Let's try to form a word that has C and E, and three new letters.

 Possibilities: We can try words like ""CLOSE"", ""SCENE"", but note:
 - ""SCENE"" has two E's? But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one E and one C, but that doesn't rule out duplicates. But since we only have one E marked, if the word had two E's, we would have seen at least one E in the correct position or another E marked? Not necessarily: because the E in position 5 was marked as present but wrong position, so there could be another E that we haven't seen.

 However, to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates until we have more information.

 We also want to test new letters.

 Let's try to think of words that have C and E, and avoid R, A, N.

 Some options:
 - ""CLOSE"": C at position 1? But wait, in ""crane"", C was at position 1 and we got a '-' meaning C is in the word but not at position 1. So we cannot put C at position 1 again. Therefore, ""CLOSE"" is invalid because it puts C at position 1.

 We must avoid putting C at position 1 and E at position 5.

 Let's try ""SCENT"": 
   S at 1, C at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5.
 But wait, we know N is not in the word (from feedback: N was marked as 'x'). So we cannot use N.

 Another option: ""CHOSE"": 
   C at 1? Again, position 1 is not allowed for C.

 We need to put C in a position other than 1. So let's try to put C at position 2,3,4, or 5.

 Similarly, E cannot be at position 5, so we can put E at 1,2,3, or 4.

 Example: ""SPICE"": 
   S at 1, P at 2, I at 3, C at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 How about ""SPICE"" but rearrange? We need to form a valid word.

 Another idea: ""CEILS"" (an old word for chisels? but might not be common) or ""CELEB"" (not 5 letters). 

 Let's think of more common words.

 How about ""SCORE""? But we know R is not in the word (from feedback: R was marked as 'x'), so we cannot use R.

 How about ""SCOPE""? 
   S at 1, C at 2, O at 3, P at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 We need to avoid E at position 5.

 How about ""EPICS""? 
   E at 1, P at 2, I at 3, C at 4, S at 5.
 This word: 
   E is at position 1 (which is allowed because previously E was at 5 and now it's at 1, which is different and not the same as the previous position for E? Actually, the feedback only said that E is not at position 5, so position 1 is fine for E).
   C is at position 4 (which is not position 1, so that's allowed).

 Also, the letters are E, P, I, C, S. None of these are R, A, or N.

 So ""epics"" is a valid word? Let me confirm: yes, ""epics"" is a word (meaning heroic deeds or grand events).

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPICE"" but with E not at 5? We can't because the word ""spice"" ends with E.

 Another option: ""CLIME"" (meaning a region or climate? but not very common). 

 Or ""CELLO"": but that has two L's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, C is at position 1 again -> not allowed.

 How about ""OUNCE""? But we know N is not in the word (from feedback: N was 'x'), so we cannot use N.

 Another idea: ""DUCHY"": 
   D at 1, U at 2, C at 3, H at 4, Y at 5.
 This uses C at position 3 (which is allowed) and does not use E? But we know E is in the word. So we must include E.

 Therefore, we must have a word that includes both C and E.

 Let me try to list words that have C and E, and avoid R, A, N, and with C not at 1 and E not at 5.

 Possibilities:
 - ""PIECE"": but has two E's? And C at position 3? Also, E at position 5 is not allowed. So we cannot use ""PIECE"" because E is at 5.

 - ""CHASE"": but has A? We know A is not in the word.

 - ""THECE"" (not common).

 - ""EXCEL"": 
   E at 1, X at 2, C at 3, E at 4, L at 5.
   This has two E's? But that's okay. 
   E at position 1: allowed (since previously E was at 5, so position 1 is new).
   C at position 3: allowed (not position 1).
   Also, the word has E at position 4 and 1? But we don't know if the secret word has two E's. 
   However, we must note that the feedback for the first guess only showed one E (at position 5) as present. If the secret word has two E's, then we would have seen two '-' for two E's? Not necessarily: because if one E was in the correct position, it would have been marked as correct. But in our case, the E at position 5 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that there is at least one E in the word that is not at position 5. There could be another E that we haven't guessed.

 But in ""excel"", we have E at position 1 and 4. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. However, we are allowed to guess words with duplicate letters to test.

 But let's check the letters: E, X, C, E, L. We are including E and C, and new letters: X, L. Also, no R, A, N.

 However, note that the first guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has at least one E that is not at position 5. If we put E at position 1 and 4, that's acceptable.

 But we must be cautious: if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E's in ""excel"" will be marked as present and the other as absent? Actually, the feedback rules: for each letter, if it is in the word, then we mark it as present (either correct position or wrong position) for each occurrence? But the secret word might have only one E, so if we guess two E's, one of them might be marked as present and the other as absent? Actually, the feedback is per letter in the guess. For each letter, if the letter is in the secret word and in the correct position, we mark it with a check. If it is in the secret word but not in the correct position, we mark it with a dash. If it is not in the secret word, we mark it with an x.

 However, if the secret word has only one E, and we guess two E's, then one of the E's (the one that is in the correct position) would be marked as check, and the other E (if it is in a position that the secret word does not have an E) would be marked as x? Or if the secret word has one E, and we have two E's in the guess, then the one that is in the correct position would be check, and the other would be x. If neither is in the correct position, then one of them would be dash (if the secret word has one E) and the other would be x? Actually, the rule is: the feedback is independent per letter? But no, the feedback accounts for the frequency. For example, if the secret word has one E and we guess two E's, then one of the E's (the one that matches the position of the E in the secret word) would be check, and the other would be x. If neither matches the position, then the first E (or the one that the game considers) might get the dash and the other x? Actually, the standard Wordle rules: the feedback is given by first marking the exact matches, then the remaining letters in the guess that are in the secret word but not matched are marked as dashes, but only up to the frequency in the secret word.

 So if the secret word has one E, and we have two E's in the guess, then one of them (if it is in the correct position) would be check, and the other would be x. If neither is in the correct position, then one of them (the first occurrence? or arbitrary?) would be dash and the other x? Actually, the game doesn't assign by order of the guess but by the secret word: it will mark the exact matches first, then for the remaining letters in the guess, if the letter is in the secret word but not yet matched (and not over the frequency), it gets a dash.

 So to avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid duplicate letters for now.

 Therefore, let's try to find a word that has C and E, and without duplicate letters, and without R, A, N, and with C not at 1 and E not at 5.

 How about ""CLUED"": 
   C at 1? Not allowed.

 How about ""SCREW"": but has R and we know R is not in the word.

 How about ""SLEPT"": but no C? We must include C.

 Another idea: ""SPECK"": 
   S at 1, P at 2, E at 3, C at 4, K at 5.
   This has E at position 3 (allowed) and C at position 4 (allowed). 
   Letters: S, P, E, C, K -> no R, A, N.

 But note: we are including K, which is a new letter.

 Is ""SPECK"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""SPICE"" but we cannot because E is at 5? But in ""SPECK"", E is at 3 and C at 4, and K at 5. So that's acceptable.

 So let's go with ""SPECK"".

 We can also consider ""CHECK"", but that has two C's? And C at position 1? Not allowed.

 Therefore, I choose ""SPECK"".

 But wait, we have to consider: the feedback for the first guess said that C is in the word but not at position 1. In ""SPECK"", C is at position 4, which is fine. E is at position 3, which is not position 5, so that's fine.

 So our next guess: ""SPECK""

<guess>speck</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (marked with `-`).
- R, A, and N are not in the secret word (marked with `x`).

For the next guess:
- Must include C and E (since they are confirmed present).
- C cannot be in position 1 (as per feedback).
- E cannot be in position 5 (as per feedback).
- Cannot include R, A, or N (as they are absent).
- Should prioritize common letters to maximize information.

The word ""SPECK"" meets all criteria:
- S (position 1), P (position 2), E (position 3), C (position 4), K (position 5).
- C is in position 4 (not 1), E is in position 3 (not 5).
- No R, A, or N.
- Tests new common letters: S, P, K.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: '-' meaning C is in the word, but not at position 1.
- R: 'x' not in the word.
- A: 'x' not in the word.
- N: 'x' not in the word.
- E: '-' meaning E is in the word, but not at position 5.

Second guess: ""speck""
- S: 'x' not in the word.
- P: 'x' not in the word.
- E: '✓' meaning E is in the correct position (position 3 of the secret word).
- C: '✓' meaning C is in the correct position (position 4 of the secret word).
- K: 'x' not in the word.

From the second guess:
- E is at position 3: so the secret word has E as the 3rd letter.
- C is at position 4: so the secret word has C as the 4th letter.

Also, we know from the first guess:
- The secret word contains C (now we know at position 4) and E (now we know at position 3), and no R, A, N.
- From the second guess, S, P, K are not in the word.

So, current knowledge:
- Positions: 
  - Position 1: unknown but not C (from first guess) and not S (from second guess).
  - Position 2: unknown.
  - Position 3: E (fixed).
  - Position 4: C (fixed).
  - Position 5: unknown, cannot be E (from first guess) and not K (from second guess).

Additionally, the word must not contain: R, A, N, S, P, K.

Now, what letters are possible?
We know the word has 5 letters: [?, ?, E, C, ?]

We also know from the first guess that C is present (now placed at position 4) and E is present (now at position 3). Are there any other letters that must be present? The first guess only showed C and E as present (besides the incorrect ones), so we don't have information about other letters in the word. But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? However, in the feedback, we haven't seen indications of duplicates yet.

But let's reconsider: the first guess had C at position 1 and it was wrong position, and now we have C at position 4 and it's correct. Similarly for E: first at 5 (wrong) and now at 3 (correct). Therefore, we have accounted for both C and E.

Therefore, the remaining letters (positions 1, 2, and 5) must be unique letters that are not any of the forbidden ones: R, A, N, S, P, K.

What letters have not been tested? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, K. So we can use other common consonants and vowels.

Common letters: B, D, H, I, L, M, O, U, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a word with the pattern: _ _ E C _

The fifth letter cannot be E (from first guess feedback: E was absent at position 5) and cannot be K or the others.

Possible words with this structure? 

For example, we could have:
- Words ending in H: ""TECH"" is not 5 letters. ""LEECH"" has double E? And has L at position 1 and 2? But our pattern is ? ? E C ?.

Possible valid words:
- ""CHECK"": but P is already ruled out? No, ""CHECK"" has CH at the beginning? Let's see: 
  C H E C K -> but wait, we know C is at position 4, so we cannot have C at position 1? But note: we also know from first guess that C is in the word but not at position 1. In ""CHECK"", the first C is at position 1, which is forbidden. Also, we have an extra C? And K is ruled out.

Actually, we cannot have C at position 1 because of the first guess: C in position 1 was marked as '-' meaning it should be elsewhere. So position 1 cannot be C.

Similarly, we have already placed C at position 4.

Another option: ""WHICH"": W H I C H -> 
  Position 1: W, Position 2: H, Position 3: I? But we need position 3 to be E. So it doesn't fit.

We need position 3 to be E and position 4 to be C.

So pattern: _ _ E C _

Some words that fit:
- CHIEF: C H I E F -> but pattern would be C at position 1? Not allowed (position 1 cannot be C). Also, position 3 is I, not E.

We need:
Position 1: not C, not S, not R, A, N, not P, not K ... from used letters: avoid R,A,N,S,P,K and C (only at position 1? we know C is at position 4, so we can have C at position 1? No, because first guess: we had C at position 1 and it was not correct, meaning C is not at position 1 in the secret word. So position 1 cannot be C.

Similarly, position 5 cannot be E and not K, and not the other forbidden letters.

List of possible words ending with E and C? Actually, the word must have E at position 3 and C at position 4.

So the word structure: [letter1][letter2] E C [letter5]

With letter1, letter2, letter5 being letters that are not forbidden and not C at position1? Letter1 can be any letter except: C, R, A, N, S, P, K.

Similarly, letter2: any letter except R,A,N,S,P,K? And letter5: any except E, R,A,N,S,P,K.

Also, there might be more constraints: we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? Yes, because E was at position 5 in ""crane"" and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So for letter5, it must not be E? Correct.

Moreover, we must not use any of the absent letters: R, A, N, S, P, K.

What about the letter in position1? We also know from the first guess that C is present and not at position1, so position1 is open as long as it's not one of the forbidden letters.

Similarly for position2: we have no direct constraint.

Now, what words have this pattern? 

Common words:

- ""BEECH"": 
  B E E C H -> position1: B, position2: E, position3: E, position4: C, position5: H.
  But note: position3 is E, which is set, and it has E at position2 and position3? That's okay? But we don't know if the secret word has two E's.

However, let's check feedback compatibility: 
  First guess: ""crane"" had E at position5 -> marked as present (wrong position). If the secret word has an E at position3, that was not guessed in first guess? So the E at position5 of the first guess must correspond to one of the E's in the secret word? But if the secret word has E only at position3, then the E at position5 in the first guess would be marked as present (because the E is at position3, which is not position5). So that fits.

But ""beec"" has two E's? Actually ""BEECH"": B-E-E-C-H. So position2 is E and position3 is E.

We are allowed to guess words with repeated letters? Yes.

However, we have not tested B and H.

But wait: in the first guess, did we rule out E being at other positions? No, because we only guessed one E at position5 and it was marked as present. So the E in the word could be at position2? Actually, the secret word could have E at positions 1,2,3,4? But position3 we now know is E.

However, the current known positions: position3=E and position4=C.

So in ""BEECH"", we have E at position2 as well.

But we haven't gotten feedback about E at position2? So it's possible.

But let's list other words to compare.

Other words:

- LEECH: L E E C H -> same issue: E at position2 and position3.

- ""FETCH"": F at position1, E at position2? Pattern: F E T C H -> positions: F E T C H? The pattern requires position3 to be E? But ""FETCH"" has E at position2 and T at position3? Doesn't match.

We need position3 to be E, so the word must have the form: [letter1] [letter2] E C [letter5]

Examples:
- ""WELCH"": W E L C H -> 
  position1: W, position2: E, position3: L? -> Incorrect, because we need position3 to be E.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake: the third letter must be E? How?

""WELCH"": W at1, E at2, L at3, C at4, H at5? That's not E at position3? But we know from the second guess that E is fixed at position3 and C at position4.

Therefore, the word must have E as the third letter and C as the fourth.

So only words of the form: XYECZ, where X, Y, Z are letters.

What are some common words that fit?
- ""DIETIC"" is 6 letters? No.
- ""BEVY"" not 5.
- I recall words like ""ELECT"" but E at position1, then L, E at3, C at4, T at5? But that would be E L E C T? So pattern: letter1=E (but we cannot have E at position1? Why?) Wait, we don't have a constraint on E at position1? Only that position5 cannot be E.

But from the first guess: E was guessed at position5, marked as present but wrong position. That does not prevent E from being at position1? Actually, no: if E were at position1, then when we guessed ""crane"", which had no E at position1, the E at position5 should have been marked as present? And it was.

So E at position1 is possible? But in our case, for the pattern, we are considering position1 to be a letter that is not forbidden.

But note: in the first guess, we had E at position5 and it was marked '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position5. It does not say anything about position1.

Therefore, E can possibly be at position1? But wait, if E were at position1, then in the first guess, we have E at position5: that would be a separate E? Or the same? If only one E, then if the secret word has E at position1, then when we guess E at position5, it should be marked '-' because it's present but wrong position? Correct. So position1 being E is allowed? But we don't have any constraint against it.

Similarly, position2 could be E? Again, possible.

However, we have fixed position3: E.

So let me list words that have E at position3 and C at position4.

Possible words:
- ""BEECH"": B E E C H -> but position2 is E.
- ""LEECH"": L E E C H -> position2 is E.
- ""HEXEC"" not a word.
- ""THEIC"" not common.
- ""ECHOS"" -> but has E at position1? Pattern: E at1, C at2, H at3? Not E at position3.

Common words:
- Actually, the options are limited. 

Another word: 
- ""PIECE"": P I E C E -> but P is ruled out? In the second guess, we had P at position2 and it was marked 'x' meaning not in the word. So we cannot have P in the word. Therefore, ""PIECE"" is not allowed because it has P (at position1).

- ""CHECK"": but C at position1? Not allowed? Because we already placed C at position4? And we haven't forbidden C at position1? We know from the first guess that C at position1 is not correct? So we cannot have C at position1? Correct, so ""CHECK"" is invalid.

But if the word has two C's? Then we could have C at position1? But wait: the first guess had C at position1 and it was marked '-', meaning the secret word contains C but not at position1. Therefore, if there is a C at position1, it would contradict that feedback? Because the dash means that C is in the word, but not at position1. So the secret word cannot have C at position1.

Therefore, position1 cannot be C.

Similarly, what if the secret word has two C's? Then we know one C is at position4, and the other C must be at position 2 or 5? And we would have to account for that. But we haven't seen any indicator of duplicate C yet? Because in the second guess, we had C at position4 and it was marked '✓', so that one is accounted for. If there was another C, we haven't guessed it.

So we must entertain the possibility of two C's? But our next guess might test that.

Back to word patterns: 

We need a word of form: _ _ E C _

Let me search for words that match:

Possible words:
- ""BEACH"": but B E A C H -> position3 is E? Position4 is C. But A is ruled out? We know A is not in the word. So invalid.
- ""BENCH"": B E N C H -> N is ruled out (from first guess). Invalid.
- ""BELCH"": B E L C H -> 
  Position1: B, position2: E, position3: L? No, pattern is first two letters: B E, then L at position3? But we need position3 to be E? This word is B-E-L-C-H? So the third letter is L, not E? 
  We need the third letter to be E. The word must have E as the third letter. So ""BELCH"" does not have E at position3.

Wait: the positions are:
  For ""BELCH"": 
    Position1: B
    Position2: E
    Position3: L
    Position4: C
    Position5: H
  That does not have E at position3? Correct.

We require position3 to be E? Exactly.

Only words with the exact structure: letter1 - letter2 - E - C - letter5.

Some examples:
- ""CHECK"": not allowed because position1 is C (forbidden) and position2 is H -> but forbidden? Not independently, but position1=C is the issue.
- ""CHEEK"": C at position1 -> forbidden? yes? So skip.
- ""BLEED"": not ending with 'C'? Doesn't match.

It's challenging. Let me think:

- ""TOPEC"" not a word.
- ""BIECS"" not a word.

Another idea: ""MECUM"" is not common.

How about ""YECCH""? Not a standard word.

Another common pattern: words like ""SELECT""? But S is ruled out? And the pattern: S E L E C T? Positions: S at1, E at2, L at3? Not E at position3? Doesn't fit.

Wait, I recall words like ""EVICT"": 
  E V I C T: pattern: E at1, V at2, I at3? Not E at position3? Doesn't fit.

Wait, we are missing a common word: ""HENCE"": 
  H E N C E -> 
    Position1: H
    Position2: E (so position2 is E)
    Position3: N -> but we need E at position3? So no.

Perhaps I need to consult a list...

But let's think: 

What words have the third letter as 'E' and fourth as 'C'? 

Examples in English:
- ""ELECT"": but E at1 and L at2, then position3=E, C at4, T at5 -> pattern: E L E C T? But E at position1? 
  That would be: 
    Position1: E
    Position2: L
    Position3: E
    Position4: C
    Position5: T

This fits? Yes, and ""elect"" is a valid word.

But we have E at position1? Is that allowed? We haven't tested E at position1, but also nothing forbidding it? The first guess said E was not at position5? Doesn't rule out position1.

And the word has two E's? That's possible.

Letters: E, L, E, C, T -> so E at position1 and position3.

Also, the word does not contain any forbidden letters: R, A, N, S, P, K.

Check the letter L: not forbidden? We haven't tested L.
Check the letter T: not forbidden? We haven't tested T.

So we can try ""ELECT"".

But let's verify with the previous feedback:

First guess: ""crane"" 
  Secret word: ""ELECT""
  Feedback: 
    C at position1: in ""crane"", C is at position1 -> but ""elect"" has E at position1, not C. So C is present (at position4) but not at position1 -> '-' for C.
    R: not in ""elect"" -> 'x'
    A: not in ""elect"" -> 'x'
    N: not in ""elect"" -> 'x'
    E at position5: ""elect"" has E at position1 and position3? But E at position5: not present? So why was it marked as '-' in the first guess? 

Wait, inconsistency: 

In ""ELECT"": letters: E, L, E, C, T -> so two E's.

When guessing ""crane"":
- E is at position5? The secret word has two E's: one at position1 and one at position3.
- So for E at position5: it should be marked as 'x' because ""ELECT"" does not have an E at position5? But also, since there are E's in the word but already matched? 

Standard Wordle: 
  The feedback is produced by first marking the exact matches. There is no exact match for any letter. Then for the other letters: 
  C is in the secret word but not at position1 -> dash.
  E is in the secret word? Yes, and not at position5? But E in the secret word is at positions 1 and 3? But both are not matched? So since there are two E's in the secret word, and we have only one E in the guess (at position5), then we would mark it as dash? But wait: the position5 E: it should be marked as dash because the secret letter has E at other positions? Even if there are multiple E's, as long as one is available to be matched as wrong position, it gets a dash.

Therefore, for ""crane"" and secret ""ELECT"":
  C: dash (because present, in the secret word at position4 but not matched exactly)
  R: not present -> x
  A: not present -> x
  N: not present -> x
  E: dash (because present, and in secret word at positions 1 and 3? So even if not matched, we mark it as dash since it is present)

So that matches the first feedback: C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)

Second guess: ""speck"" with secret ""ELECT""
  S: not in word -> x
  P: not in word -> x
  E: at position3? Exactly matches -> ✓
  C: at position4 matches -> ✓
  K: not present -> x

Which matches: S(x) P(x) E(✓) C(✓) K(x)

Therefore, ""ELECT"" is a candidate.

But are there other possibilities? 

Another word: ""JECCA"" not a word.

Or ""NEEZY"" not common.

Another common word: 
- ""EXACT"" : but let's see: 
  Position1: E? 
  Position2: X?
  Position3: A? But we need E at position3? Doesn't match.

Another candidate: ""OLEIC""? not common.

But ""ELECT"" seems viable.

Another candidate: ""DIREC"" not a word.

Or ""DEFEC"": not common.

""DEICE"": 
  D E I C E -> 
  Position1: D
  Position2: E
  Position3: I -> not E? We need position3 to be E. So doesn't fit.

So only ""ELECT"" comes to mind? But wait, there might be others.

""ELBEC"" not a word.

""VELCE"" not a word.

""CLEEK"": C L E E K -> but C at position1? Forbidden? And K ruled out? So invalid.

""BLEEP"": B L E E P -> 
  Pattern: B L E (position3) E (position4) P? But we need C at position4? Doesn't work.

Therefore, ""ELECT"" seems a good candidate.

But what about ""EWECS""? Not a word.

Another option: ""BEDEW""? Not matching.

Perhaps ""ELECT"" is the most common word.

But note: in ""ELECT"", position1 is E? And position2 is L? We haven't guessed L.

Now, we have 6 tries, we are at guess 3? So we can guess ""ELECT"".

But alternatively, if we want to test more letters, we could choose a word that doesn't have E at other positions to not assume duplicates? But we don't know.

Let's consider: we know the secret word has E at position3 and C at position4. The first feedback showed E present in the word but not at position5. For ""ELECT"", that is satisfied by E at position1 and/or position3? But we only need one E elsewhere? And we have two? So it fits.

But maybe there are other words without E at position1? 

For example:
- If we avoid position1=E, then what? Position1 and position2 must be different letters.

Let's try ""QUIET""? But Q U I E T does not have C at position4? No.

Another one: ""PLEC"" not 5.

Or ""GRECO"": G R E C O -> but R is ruled out? So invalid.

""WHITE""? Pattern: W H I T E -> no.

Perhaps ""ELECT"" is a candidate.

Another word: ""MEZZO""? not EC at the end.

Perhaps ""ELECT"" is the only common word? But I recall ""FLECK"": F L E C K -> 
  Pattern: F L E C K -> 
    Position3=E, position4=C? Yes. 
  But K is ruled out? (from second guess: K is not in the word). So ""FLECK"" has K at position5? Forbidden. So invalid.

Therefore, I think ""ELECT"" is a valid candidate.

But let's make sure: is there a word like ""THEIC"" -> not common.

""BEVUE"" not matching.

So I'll go with ""ELECT"".

If ""ELECT"" is not the secret word, at least it will give information about E at position1 and L at position2 and T at position5.

But for efficiency, we might choose a word that doesn't duplicate E? No, because we don't know.

But ""ELECT"" is a valid guess.

Therefore, our next guess is ""ELECT"".

But note: we have not tested L and T? So we are testing them.

If we want to be more systematic, we might choose a word that tests new letters? And avoids duplicates? But ""ELECT"" tests L and T? Yes.

Alternative: if we try non-E at position1? For example:
- ""BLECK"" not a word? Or ""BLECS"" not common.
- ""GLECH"" not common.

Another common word? ""BIECS"" not a word.

So I think ""ELECT"" is the best.

<guess>elect</guess>

Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
  Meaning:  
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - R, A, N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: speck → Feedback: S(x) P(x) E(✓) C(✓) K(x)**  
  Meaning:  
  - E is in the correct position (position 3).  
  - C is in the correct position (position 4).  
  - S, P, K are not in the word.

**Summary of known information:**  
- The secret word pattern: `[unknown] [unknown] E C [unknown]`.  
- Position 3 = E (fixed).  
- Position 4 = C (fixed).  
- Forbidden letters (not in the word): R, A, N, S, P, K.  
- Position 1 ≠ C (from Guess 1 feedback).  
- Position 5 ≠ E (from Guess 1 feedback).  

Possible letters for positions 1, 2, and 5 include common consonants/vowels not tested yet: B, D, H, I, L, M, O, u, W, Y, etc.  

After evaluating word options that fit the pattern `_ _ E C _` and avoid forbidden letters:
- **""ELECT""** is a valid candidate:  
  - Pattern: `E L E C T` → Position 1 = E, Position 2 = L, Position 3 = E (matches fixed E), Position 4 = C (matches fixed C), Position 5 = T.  
  - E at position 1 is allowed (no constraint against E at position 2 from feedback).  
  - L and T are untested letters, providing new information.  
  - Contains two E’s, which aligns with Guess 1 feedback (E present but not at position 5).  

Testing ""ELECT"" will either win the game or provide critical feedback on the remaining unknown positions and letters.

<guess>elect</guess>",elect,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: '-' meaning C is in the word, but not at position 1.
- R: 'x' not in the word.
- A: 'x' not in the word.
- N: 'x' not in the word.
- E: '-' meaning E is in the word, but not at position 5.

Second guess: ""speck""
- S: 'x' not in the word.
- P: 'x' not in the word.
- E: '✓' meaning E is in the correct position (position 3 of the secret word).
- C: '✓' meaning C is in the correct position (position 4 of the secret word).
- K: 'x' not in the word.

From the second guess:
- E is at position 3: so the secret word has E as the 3rd letter.
- C is at position 4: so the secret word has C as the 4th letter.

Also, we know from the first guess:
- The secret word contains C (now we know at position 4) and E (now we know at position 3), and no R, A, N.
- From the second guess, S, P, K are not in the word.

So, current knowledge:
- Positions: 
  - Position 1: unknown but not C (from first guess) and not S (from second guess).
  - Position 2: unknown.
  - Position 3: E (fixed).
  - Position 4: C (fixed).
  - Position 5: unknown, cannot be E (from first guess) and not K (from second guess).

Additionally, the word must not contain: R, A, N, S, P, K.

Now, what letters are possible?
We know the word has 5 letters: [?, ?, E, C, ?]

We also know from the first guess that C is present (now placed at position 4) and E is present (now at position 3). Are there any other letters that must be present? The first guess only showed C and E as present (besides the incorrect ones), so we don't have information about other letters in the word. But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? However, in the feedback, we haven't seen indications of duplicates yet.

But let's reconsider: the first guess had C at position 1 and it was wrong position, and now we have C at position 4 and it's correct. Similarly for E: first at 5 (wrong) and now at 3 (correct). Therefore, we have accounted for both C and E.

Therefore, the remaining letters (positions 1, 2, and 5) must be unique letters that are not any of the forbidden ones: R, A, N, S, P, K.

What letters have not been tested? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, K. So we can use other common consonants and vowels.

Common letters: B, D, H, I, L, M, O, U, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a word with the pattern: _ _ E C _

The fifth letter cannot be E (from first guess feedback: E was absent at position 5) and cannot be K or the others.

Possible words with this structure? 

For example, we could have:
- Words ending in H: ""TECH"" is not 5 letters. ""LEECH"" has double E? And has L at position 1 and 2? But our pattern is ? ? E C ?.

Possible valid words:
- ""CHECK"": but P is already ruled out? No, ""CHECK"" has CH at the beginning? Let's see: 
  C H E C K -> but wait, we know C is at position 4, so we cannot have C at position 1? But note: we also know from first guess that C is in the word but not at position 1. In ""CHECK"", the first C is at position 1, which is forbidden. Also, we have an extra C? And K is ruled out.

Actually, we cannot have C at position 1 because of the first guess: C in position 1 was marked as '-' meaning it should be elsewhere. So position 1 cannot be C.

Similarly, we have already placed C at position 4.

Another option: ""WHICH"": W H I C H -> 
  Position 1: W, Position 2: H, Position 3: I? But we need position 3 to be E. So it doesn't fit.

We need position 3 to be E and position 4 to be C.

So pattern: _ _ E C _

Some words that fit:
- CHIEF: C H I E F -> but pattern would be C at position 1? Not allowed (position 1 cannot be C). Also, position 3 is I, not E.

We need:
Position 1: not C, not S, not R, A, N, not P, not K ... from used letters: avoid R,A,N,S,P,K and C (only at position 1? we know C is at position 4, so we can have C at position 1? No, because first guess: we had C at position 1 and it was not correct, meaning C is not at position 1 in the secret word. So position 1 cannot be C.

Similarly, position 5 cannot be E and not K, and not the other forbidden letters.

List of possible words ending with E and C? Actually, the word must have E at position 3 and C at position 4.

So the word structure: [letter1][letter2] E C [letter5]

With letter1, letter2, letter5 being letters that are not forbidden and not C at position1? Letter1 can be any letter except: C, R, A, N, S, P, K.

Similarly, letter2: any letter except R,A,N,S,P,K? And letter5: any except E, R,A,N,S,P,K.

Also, there might be more constraints: we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? Yes, because E was at position 5 in ""crane"" and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So for letter5, it must not be E? Correct.

Moreover, we must not use any of the absent letters: R, A, N, S, P, K.

What about the letter in position1? We also know from the first guess that C is present and not at position1, so position1 is open as long as it's not one of the forbidden letters.

Similarly for position2: we have no direct constraint.

Now, what words have this pattern? 

Common words:

- ""BEECH"": 
  B E E C H -> position1: B, position2: E, position3: E, position4: C, position5: H.
  But note: position3 is E, which is set, and it has E at position2 and position3? That's okay? But we don't know if the secret word has two E's.

However, let's check feedback compatibility: 
  First guess: ""crane"" had E at position5 -> marked as present (wrong position). If the secret word has an E at position3, that was not guessed in first guess? So the E at position5 of the first guess must correspond to one of the E's in the secret word? But if the secret word has E only at position3, then the E at position5 in the first guess would be marked as present (because the E is at position3, which is not position5). So that fits.

But ""beec"" has two E's? Actually ""BEECH"": B-E-E-C-H. So position2 is E and position3 is E.

We are allowed to guess words with repeated letters? Yes.

However, we have not tested B and H.

But wait: in the first guess, did we rule out E being at other positions? No, because we only guessed one E at position5 and it was marked as present. So the E in the word could be at position2? Actually, the secret word could have E at positions 1,2,3,4? But position3 we now know is E.

However, the current known positions: position3=E and position4=C.

So in ""BEECH"", we have E at position2 as well.

But we haven't gotten feedback about E at position2? So it's possible.

But let's list other words to compare.

Other words:

- LEECH: L E E C H -> same issue: E at position2 and position3.

- ""FETCH"": F at position1, E at position2? Pattern: F E T C H -> positions: F E T C H? The pattern requires position3 to be E? But ""FETCH"" has E at position2 and T at position3? Doesn't match.

We need position3 to be E, so the word must have the form: [letter1] [letter2] E C [letter5]

Examples:
- ""WELCH"": W E L C H -> 
  position1: W, position2: E, position3: L? -> Incorrect, because we need position3 to be E.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake: the third letter must be E? How?

""WELCH"": W at1, E at2, L at3, C at4, H at5? That's not E at position3? But we know from the second guess that E is fixed at position3 and C at position4.

Therefore, the word must have E as the third letter and C as the fourth.

So only words of the form: XYECZ, where X, Y, Z are letters.

What are some common words that fit?
- ""DIETIC"" is 6 letters? No.
- ""BEVY"" not 5.
- I recall words like ""ELECT"" but E at position1, then L, E at3, C at4, T at5? But that would be E L E C T? So pattern: letter1=E (but we cannot have E at position1? Why?) Wait, we don't have a constraint on E at position1? Only that position5 cannot be E.

But from the first guess: E was guessed at position5, marked as present but wrong position. That does not prevent E from being at position1? Actually, no: if E were at position1, then when we guessed ""crane"", which had no E at position1, the E at position5 should have been marked as present? And it was.

So E at position1 is possible? But in our case, for the pattern, we are considering position1 to be a letter that is not forbidden.

But note: in the first guess, we had E at position5 and it was marked '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position5. It does not say anything about position1.

Therefore, E can possibly be at position1? But wait, if E were at position1, then in the first guess, we have E at position5: that would be a separate E? Or the same? If only one E, then if the secret word has E at position1, then when we guess E at position5, it should be marked '-' because it's present but wrong position? Correct. So position1 being E is allowed? But we don't have any constraint against it.

Similarly, position2 could be E? Again, possible.

However, we have fixed position3: E.

So let me list words that have E at position3 and C at position4.

Possible words:
- ""BEECH"": B E E C H -> but position2 is E.
- ""LEECH"": L E E C H -> position2 is E.
- ""HEXEC"" not a word.
- ""THEIC"" not common.
- ""ECHOS"" -> but has E at position1? Pattern: E at1, C at2, H at3? Not E at position3.

Common words:
- Actually, the options are limited. 

Another word: 
- ""PIECE"": P I E C E -> but P is ruled out? In the second guess, we had P at position2 and it was marked 'x' meaning not in the word. So we cannot have P in the word. Therefore, ""PIECE"" is not allowed because it has P (at position1).

- ""CHECK"": but C at position1? Not allowed? Because we already placed C at position4? And we haven't forbidden C at position1? We know from the first guess that C at position1 is not correct? So we cannot have C at position1? Correct, so ""CHECK"" is invalid.

But if the word has two C's? Then we could have C at position1? But wait: the first guess had C at position1 and it was marked '-', meaning the secret word contains C but not at position1. Therefore, if there is a C at position1, it would contradict that feedback? Because the dash means that C is in the word, but not at position1. So the secret word cannot have C at position1.

Therefore, position1 cannot be C.

Similarly, what if the secret word has two C's? Then we know one C is at position4, and the other C must be at position 2 or 5? And we would have to account for that. But we haven't seen any indicator of duplicate C yet? Because in the second guess, we had C at position4 and it was marked '✓', so that one is accounted for. If there was another C, we haven't guessed it.

So we must entertain the possibility of two C's? But our next guess might test that.

Back to word patterns: 

We need a word of form: _ _ E C _

Let me search for words that match:

Possible words:
- ""BEACH"": but B E A C H -> position3 is E? Position4 is C. But A is ruled out? We know A is not in the word. So invalid.
- ""BENCH"": B E N C H -> N is ruled out (from first guess). Invalid.
- ""BELCH"": B E L C H -> 
  Position1: B, position2: E, position3: L? No, pattern is first two letters: B E, then L at position3? But we need position3 to be E? This word is B-E-L-C-H? So the third letter is L, not E? 
  We need the third letter to be E. The word must have E as the third letter. So ""BELCH"" does not have E at position3.

Wait: the positions are:
  For ""BELCH"": 
    Position1: B
    Position2: E
    Position3: L
    Position4: C
    Position5: H
  That does not have E at position3? Correct.

We require position3 to be E? Exactly.

Only words with the exact structure: letter1 - letter2 - E - C - letter5.

Some examples:
- ""CHECK"": not allowed because position1 is C (forbidden) and position2 is H -> but forbidden? Not independently, but position1=C is the issue.
- ""CHEEK"": C at position1 -> forbidden? yes? So skip.
- ""BLEED"": not ending with 'C'? Doesn't match.

It's challenging. Let me think:

- ""TOPEC"" not a word.
- ""BIECS"" not a word.

Another idea: ""MECUM"" is not common.

How about ""YECCH""? Not a standard word.

Another common pattern: words like ""SELECT""? But S is ruled out? And the pattern: S E L E C T? Positions: S at1, E at2, L at3? Not E at position3? Doesn't fit.

Wait, I recall words like ""EVICT"": 
  E V I C T: pattern: E at1, V at2, I at3? Not E at position3? Doesn't fit.

Wait, we are missing a common word: ""HENCE"": 
  H E N C E -> 
    Position1: H
    Position2: E (so position2 is E)
    Position3: N -> but we need E at position3? So no.

Perhaps I need to consult a list...

But let's think: 

What words have the third letter as 'E' and fourth as 'C'? 

Examples in English:
- ""ELECT"": but E at1 and L at2, then position3=E, C at4, T at5 -> pattern: E L E C T? But E at position1? 
  That would be: 
    Position1: E
    Position2: L
    Position3: E
    Position4: C
    Position5: T

This fits? Yes, and ""elect"" is a valid word.

But we have E at position1? Is that allowed? We haven't tested E at position1, but also nothing forbidding it? The first guess said E was not at position5? Doesn't rule out position1.

And the word has two E's? That's possible.

Letters: E, L, E, C, T -> so E at position1 and position3.

Also, the word does not contain any forbidden letters: R, A, N, S, P, K.

Check the letter L: not forbidden? We haven't tested L.
Check the letter T: not forbidden? We haven't tested T.

So we can try ""ELECT"".

But let's verify with the previous feedback:

First guess: ""crane"" 
  Secret word: ""ELECT""
  Feedback: 
    C at position1: in ""crane"", C is at position1 -> but ""elect"" has E at position1, not C. So C is present (at position4) but not at position1 -> '-' for C.
    R: not in ""elect"" -> 'x'
    A: not in ""elect"" -> 'x'
    N: not in ""elect"" -> 'x'
    E at position5: ""elect"" has E at position1 and position3? But E at position5: not present? So why was it marked as '-' in the first guess? 

Wait, inconsistency: 

In ""ELECT"": letters: E, L, E, C, T -> so two E's.

When guessing ""crane"":
- E is at position5? The secret word has two E's: one at position1 and one at position3.
- So for E at position5: it should be marked as 'x' because ""ELECT"" does not have an E at position5? But also, since there are E's in the word but already matched? 

Standard Wordle: 
  The feedback is produced by first marking the exact matches. There is no exact match for any letter. Then for the other letters: 
  C is in the secret word but not at position1 -> dash.
  E is in the secret word? Yes, and not at position5? But E in the secret word is at positions 1 and 3? But both are not matched? So since there are two E's in the secret word, and we have only one E in the guess (at position5), then we would mark it as dash? But wait: the position5 E: it should be marked as dash because the secret letter has E at other positions? Even if there are multiple E's, as long as one is available to be matched as wrong position, it gets a dash.

Therefore, for ""crane"" and secret ""ELECT"":
  C: dash (because present, in the secret word at position4 but not matched exactly)
  R: not present -> x
  A: not present -> x
  N: not present -> x
  E: dash (because present, and in secret word at positions 1 and 3? So even if not matched, we mark it as dash since it is present)

So that matches the first feedback: C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)

Second guess: ""speck"" with secret ""ELECT""
  S: not in word -> x
  P: not in word -> x
  E: at position3? Exactly matches -> ✓
  C: at position4 matches -> ✓
  K: not present -> x

Which matches: S(x) P(x) E(✓) C(✓) K(x)

Therefore, ""ELECT"" is a candidate.

But are there other possibilities? 

Another word: ""JECCA"" not a word.

Or ""NEEZY"" not common.

Another common word: 
- ""EXACT"" : but let's see: 
  Position1: E? 
  Position2: X?
  Position3: A? But we need E at position3? Doesn't match.

Another candidate: ""OLEIC""? not common.

But ""ELECT"" seems viable.

Another candidate: ""DIREC"" not a word.

Or ""DEFEC"": not common.

""DEICE"": 
  D E I C E -> 
  Position1: D
  Position2: E
  Position3: I -> not E? We need position3 to be E. So doesn't fit.

So only ""ELECT"" comes to mind? But wait, there might be others.

""ELBEC"" not a word.

""VELCE"" not a word.

""CLEEK"": C L E E K -> but C at position1? Forbidden? And K ruled out? So invalid.

""BLEEP"": B L E E P -> 
  Pattern: B L E (position3) E (position4) P? But we need C at position4? Doesn't work.

Therefore, ""ELECT"" seems a good candidate.

But what about ""EWECS""? Not a word.

Another option: ""BEDEW""? Not matching.

Perhaps ""ELECT"" is the most common word.

But note: in ""ELECT"", position1 is E? And position2 is L? We haven't guessed L.

Now, we have 6 tries, we are at guess 3? So we can guess ""ELECT"".

But alternatively, if we want to test more letters, we could choose a word that doesn't have E at other positions to not assume duplicates? But we don't know.

Let's consider: we know the secret word has E at position3 and C at position4. The first feedback showed E present in the word but not at position5. For ""ELECT"", that is satisfied by E at position1 and/or position3? But we only need one E elsewhere? And we have two? So it fits.

But maybe there are other words without E at position1? 

For example:
- If we avoid position1=E, then what? Position1 and position2 must be different letters.

Let's try ""QUIET""? But Q U I E T does not have C at position4? No.

Another one: ""PLEC"" not 5.

Or ""GRECO"": G R E C O -> but R is ruled out? So invalid.

""WHITE""? Pattern: W H I T E -> no.

Perhaps ""ELECT"" is a candidate.

Another word: ""MEZZO""? not EC at the end.

Perhaps ""ELECT"" is the only common word? But I recall ""FLECK"": F L E C K -> 
  Pattern: F L E C K -> 
    Position3=E, position4=C? Yes. 
  But K is ruled out? (from second guess: K is not in the word). So ""FLECK"" has K at position5? Forbidden. So invalid.

Therefore, I think ""ELECT"" is a valid candidate.

But let's make sure: is there a word like ""THEIC"" -> not common.

""BEVUE"" not matching.

So I'll go with ""ELECT"".

If ""ELECT"" is not the secret word, at least it will give information about E at position1 and L at position2 and T at position5.

But for efficiency, we might choose a word that doesn't duplicate E? No, because we don't know.

But ""ELECT"" is a valid guess.

Therefore, our next guess is ""ELECT"".

But note: we have not tested L and T? So we are testing them.

If we want to be more systematic, we might choose a word that tests new letters? And avoids duplicates? But ""ELECT"" tests L and T? Yes.

Alternative: if we try non-E at position1? For example:
- ""BLECK"" not a word? Or ""BLECS"" not common.
- ""GLECH"" not common.

Another common word? ""BIECS"" not a word.

So I think ""ELECT"" is the best.

<guess>elect</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
  Meaning:  
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - R, A, N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: speck → Feedback: S(x) P(x) E(✓) C(✓) K(x)**  
  Meaning:  
  - E is in the correct position (position 3).  
  - C is in the correct position (position 4).  
  - S, P, K are not in the word.

**Summary of known information:**  
- The secret word pattern: `[unknown] [unknown] E C [unknown]`.  
- Position 3 = E (fixed).  
- Position 4 = C (fixed).  
- Forbidden letters (not in the word): R, A, N, S, P, K.  
- Position 1 ≠ C (from Guess 1 feedback).  
- Position 5 ≠ E (from Guess 1 feedback).  

Possible letters for positions 1, 2, and 5 include common consonants/vowels not tested yet: B, D, H, I, L, M, O, u, W, Y, etc.  

After evaluating word options that fit the pattern `_ _ E C _` and avoid forbidden letters:
- **""ELECT""** is a valid candidate:  
  - Pattern: `E L E C T` → Position 1 = E, Position 2 = L, Position 3 = E (matches fixed E), Position 4 = C (matches fixed C), Position 5 = T.  
  - E at position 1 is allowed (no constraint against E at position 2 from feedback).  
  - L and T are untested letters, providing new information.  
  - Contains two E’s, which aligns with Guess 1 feedback (E present but not at position 5).  

Testing ""ELECT"" will either win the game or provide critical feedback on the remaining unknown positions and letters.",Guess 3: elect -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) E(✓) C(✓) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,leech,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all frequent in English words.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: x (A is not in the secret word)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: - (E is in the secret word but in the wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters C and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, C was in position 1, so it must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5 in the secret word.
   E was in position 5, so it must be in one of positions 1,2,3,4 in the secret word.
 - The secret word does not contain R, A, or N.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Does not contain R, A, or N (because they are not in the secret word).
 2. Contains C and E, but not in the same positions as in ""crane"" (i.e., C cannot be at position 1, E cannot be at position 5).
 3. We might also want to include other common letters to test.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible: B, D, H, I, L, O, S, T, U, etc.

 We know the word has 5 letters and must include C and E.

 Since C cannot be at position 1, and E cannot be at position 5, we can try to place C in a different position and E in a different position.

 Also, note that the word does not have R, A, N.

 Let's try to form a word that has C and E, and three new letters.

 Possibilities: We can try words like ""CLOSE"", ""SCENE"", but note:
 - ""SCENE"" has two E's? But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one E and one C, but that doesn't rule out duplicates. But since we only have one E marked, if the word had two E's, we would have seen at least one E in the correct position or another E marked? Not necessarily: because the E in position 5 was marked as present but wrong position, so there could be another E that we haven't seen.

 However, to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates until we have more information.

 We also want to test new letters.

 Let's try to think of words that have C and E, and avoid R, A, N.

 Some options:
 - ""CLOSE"": C at position 1? But wait, in ""crane"", C was at position 1 and we got a '-' meaning C is in the word but not at position 1. So we cannot put C at position 1 again. Therefore, ""CLOSE"" is invalid because it puts C at position 1.

 We must avoid putting C at position 1 and E at position 5.

 Let's try ""SCENT"": 
   S at 1, C at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5.
 But wait, we know N is not in the word (from feedback: N was marked as 'x'). So we cannot use N.

 Another option: ""CHOSE"": 
   C at 1? Again, position 1 is not allowed for C.

 We need to put C in a position other than 1. So let's try to put C at position 2,3,4, or 5.

 Similarly, E cannot be at position 5, so we can put E at 1,2,3, or 4.

 Example: ""SPICE"": 
   S at 1, P at 2, I at 3, C at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 How about ""SPICE"" but rearrange? We need to form a valid word.

 Another idea: ""CEILS"" (an old word for chisels? but might not be common) or ""CELEB"" (not 5 letters). 

 Let's think of more common words.

 How about ""SCORE""? But we know R is not in the word (from feedback: R was marked as 'x'), so we cannot use R.

 How about ""SCOPE""? 
   S at 1, C at 2, O at 3, P at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.

 We need to avoid E at position 5.

 How about ""EPICS""? 
   E at 1, P at 2, I at 3, C at 4, S at 5.
 This word: 
   E is at position 1 (which is allowed because previously E was at 5 and now it's at 1, which is different and not the same as the previous position for E? Actually, the feedback only said that E is not at position 5, so position 1 is fine for E).
   C is at position 4 (which is not position 1, so that's allowed).

 Also, the letters are E, P, I, C, S. None of these are R, A, or N.

 So ""epics"" is a valid word? Let me confirm: yes, ""epics"" is a word (meaning heroic deeds or grand events).

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPICE"" but with E not at 5? We can't because the word ""spice"" ends with E.

 Another option: ""CLIME"" (meaning a region or climate? but not very common). 

 Or ""CELLO"": but that has two L's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, C is at position 1 again -> not allowed.

 How about ""OUNCE""? But we know N is not in the word (from feedback: N was 'x'), so we cannot use N.

 Another idea: ""DUCHY"": 
   D at 1, U at 2, C at 3, H at 4, Y at 5.
 This uses C at position 3 (which is allowed) and does not use E? But we know E is in the word. So we must include E.

 Therefore, we must have a word that includes both C and E.

 Let me try to list words that have C and E, and avoid R, A, N, and with C not at 1 and E not at 5.

 Possibilities:
 - ""PIECE"": but has two E's? And C at position 3? Also, E at position 5 is not allowed. So we cannot use ""PIECE"" because E is at 5.

 - ""CHASE"": but has A? We know A is not in the word.

 - ""THECE"" (not common).

 - ""EXCEL"": 
   E at 1, X at 2, C at 3, E at 4, L at 5.
   This has two E's? But that's okay. 
   E at position 1: allowed (since previously E was at 5, so position 1 is new).
   C at position 3: allowed (not position 1).
   Also, the word has E at position 4 and 1? But we don't know if the secret word has two E's. 
   However, we must note that the feedback for the first guess only showed one E (at position 5) as present. If the secret word has two E's, then we would have seen two '-' for two E's? Not necessarily: because if one E was in the correct position, it would have been marked as correct. But in our case, the E at position 5 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that there is at least one E in the word that is not at position 5. There could be another E that we haven't guessed.

 But in ""excel"", we have E at position 1 and 4. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. However, we are allowed to guess words with duplicate letters to test.

 But let's check the letters: E, X, C, E, L. We are including E and C, and new letters: X, L. Also, no R, A, N.

 However, note that the first guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has at least one E that is not at position 5. If we put E at position 1 and 4, that's acceptable.

 But we must be cautious: if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E's in ""excel"" will be marked as present and the other as absent? Actually, the feedback rules: for each letter, if it is in the word, then we mark it as present (either correct position or wrong position) for each occurrence? But the secret word might have only one E, so if we guess two E's, one of them might be marked as present and the other as absent? Actually, the feedback is per letter in the guess. For each letter, if the letter is in the secret word and in the correct position, we mark it with a check. If it is in the secret word but not in the correct position, we mark it with a dash. If it is not in the secret word, we mark it with an x.

 However, if the secret word has only one E, and we guess two E's, then one of the E's (the one that is in the correct position) would be marked as check, and the other E (if it is in a position that the secret word does not have an E) would be marked as x? Or if the secret word has one E, and we have two E's in the guess, then the one that is in the correct position would be check, and the other would be x. If neither is in the correct position, then one of them would be dash (if the secret word has one E) and the other would be x? Actually, the rule is: the feedback is independent per letter? But no, the feedback accounts for the frequency. For example, if the secret word has one E and we guess two E's, then one of the E's (the one that matches the position of the E in the secret word) would be check, and the other would be x. If neither matches the position, then the first E (or the one that the game considers) might get the dash and the other x? Actually, the standard Wordle rules: the feedback is given by first marking the exact matches, then the remaining letters in the guess that are in the secret word but not matched are marked as dashes, but only up to the frequency in the secret word.

 So if the secret word has one E, and we have two E's in the guess, then one of them (if it is in the correct position) would be check, and the other would be x. If neither is in the correct position, then one of them (the first occurrence? or arbitrary?) would be dash and the other x? Actually, the game doesn't assign by order of the guess but by the secret word: it will mark the exact matches first, then for the remaining letters in the guess, if the letter is in the secret word but not yet matched (and not over the frequency), it gets a dash.

 So to avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid duplicate letters for now.

 Therefore, let's try to find a word that has C and E, and without duplicate letters, and without R, A, N, and with C not at 1 and E not at 5.

 How about ""CLUED"": 
   C at 1? Not allowed.

 How about ""SCREW"": but has R and we know R is not in the word.

 How about ""SLEPT"": but no C? We must include C.

 Another idea: ""SPECK"": 
   S at 1, P at 2, E at 3, C at 4, K at 5.
   This has E at position 3 (allowed) and C at position 4 (allowed). 
   Letters: S, P, E, C, K -> no R, A, N.

 But note: we are including K, which is a new letter.

 Is ""SPECK"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""SPICE"" but we cannot because E is at 5? But in ""SPECK"", E is at 3 and C at 4, and K at 5. So that's acceptable.

 So let's go with ""SPECK"".

 We can also consider ""CHECK"", but that has two C's? And C at position 1? Not allowed.

 Therefore, I choose ""SPECK"".

 But wait, we have to consider: the feedback for the first guess said that C is in the word but not at position 1. In ""SPECK"", C is at position 4, which is fine. E is at position 3, which is not position 5, so that's fine.

 So our next guess: ""SPECK""

<guess>speck</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (marked with `-`).
- R, A, and N are not in the secret word (marked with `x`).

For the next guess:
- Must include C and E (since they are confirmed present).
- C cannot be in position 1 (as per feedback).
- E cannot be in position 5 (as per feedback).
- Cannot include R, A, or N (as they are absent).
- Should prioritize common letters to maximize information.

The word ""SPECK"" meets all criteria:
- S (position 1), P (position 2), E (position 3), C (position 4), K (position 5).
- C is in position 4 (not 1), E is in position 3 (not 5).
- No R, A, or N.
- Tests new common letters: S, P, K.

<guess>speck</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: speck -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) E(✓) C(✓) K(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: '-' meaning C is in the word, but not at position 1.
- R: 'x' not in the word.
- A: 'x' not in the word.
- N: 'x' not in the word.
- E: '-' meaning E is in the word, but not at position 5.

Second guess: ""speck""
- S: 'x' not in the word.
- P: 'x' not in the word.
- E: '✓' meaning E is in the correct position (position 3 of the secret word).
- C: '✓' meaning C is in the correct position (position 4 of the secret word).
- K: 'x' not in the word.

From the second guess:
- E is at position 3: so the secret word has E as the 3rd letter.
- C is at position 4: so the secret word has C as the 4th letter.

Also, we know from the first guess:
- The secret word contains C (now we know at position 4) and E (now we know at position 3), and no R, A, N.
- From the second guess, S, P, K are not in the word.

So, current knowledge:
- Positions: 
  - Position 1: unknown but not C (from first guess) and not S (from second guess).
  - Position 2: unknown.
  - Position 3: E (fixed).
  - Position 4: C (fixed).
  - Position 5: unknown, cannot be E (from first guess) and not K (from second guess).

Additionally, the word must not contain: R, A, N, S, P, K.

Now, what letters are possible?
We know the word has 5 letters: [?, ?, E, C, ?]

We also know from the first guess that C is present (now placed at position 4) and E is present (now at position 3). Are there any other letters that must be present? The first guess only showed C and E as present (besides the incorrect ones), so we don't have information about other letters in the word. But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? However, in the feedback, we haven't seen indications of duplicates yet.

But let's reconsider: the first guess had C at position 1 and it was wrong position, and now we have C at position 4 and it's correct. Similarly for E: first at 5 (wrong) and now at 3 (correct). Therefore, we have accounted for both C and E.

Therefore, the remaining letters (positions 1, 2, and 5) must be unique letters that are not any of the forbidden ones: R, A, N, S, P, K.

What letters have not been tested? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, K. So we can use other common consonants and vowels.

Common letters: B, D, H, I, L, M, O, U, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a word with the pattern: _ _ E C _

The fifth letter cannot be E (from first guess feedback: E was absent at position 5) and cannot be K or the others.

Possible words with this structure? 

For example, we could have:
- Words ending in H: ""TECH"" is not 5 letters. ""LEECH"" has double E? And has L at position 1 and 2? But our pattern is ? ? E C ?.

Possible valid words:
- ""CHECK"": but P is already ruled out? No, ""CHECK"" has CH at the beginning? Let's see: 
  C H E C K -> but wait, we know C is at position 4, so we cannot have C at position 1? But note: we also know from first guess that C is in the word but not at position 1. In ""CHECK"", the first C is at position 1, which is forbidden. Also, we have an extra C? And K is ruled out.

Actually, we cannot have C at position 1 because of the first guess: C in position 1 was marked as '-' meaning it should be elsewhere. So position 1 cannot be C.

Similarly, we have already placed C at position 4.

Another option: ""WHICH"": W H I C H -> 
  Position 1: W, Position 2: H, Position 3: I? But we need position 3 to be E. So it doesn't fit.

We need position 3 to be E and position 4 to be C.

So pattern: _ _ E C _

Some words that fit:
- CHIEF: C H I E F -> but pattern would be C at position 1? Not allowed (position 1 cannot be C). Also, position 3 is I, not E.

We need:
Position 1: not C, not S, not R, A, N, not P, not K ... from used letters: avoid R,A,N,S,P,K and C (only at position 1? we know C is at position 4, so we can have C at position 1? No, because first guess: we had C at position 1 and it was not correct, meaning C is not at position 1 in the secret word. So position 1 cannot be C.

Similarly, position 5 cannot be E and not K, and not the other forbidden letters.

List of possible words ending with E and C? Actually, the word must have E at position 3 and C at position 4.

So the word structure: [letter1][letter2] E C [letter5]

With letter1, letter2, letter5 being letters that are not forbidden and not C at position1? Letter1 can be any letter except: C, R, A, N, S, P, K.

Similarly, letter2: any letter except R,A,N,S,P,K? And letter5: any except E, R,A,N,S,P,K.

Also, there might be more constraints: we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? Yes, because E was at position 5 in ""crane"" and got '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So for letter5, it must not be E? Correct.

Moreover, we must not use any of the absent letters: R, A, N, S, P, K.

What about the letter in position1? We also know from the first guess that C is present and not at position1, so position1 is open as long as it's not one of the forbidden letters.

Similarly for position2: we have no direct constraint.

Now, what words have this pattern? 

Common words:

- ""BEECH"": 
  B E E C H -> position1: B, position2: E, position3: E, position4: C, position5: H.
  But note: position3 is E, which is set, and it has E at position2 and position3? That's okay? But we don't know if the secret word has two E's.

However, let's check feedback compatibility: 
  First guess: ""crane"" had E at position5 -> marked as present (wrong position). If the secret word has an E at position3, that was not guessed in first guess? So the E at position5 of the first guess must correspond to one of the E's in the secret word? But if the secret word has E only at position3, then the E at position5 in the first guess would be marked as present (because the E is at position3, which is not position5). So that fits.

But ""beec"" has two E's? Actually ""BEECH"": B-E-E-C-H. So position2 is E and position3 is E.

We are allowed to guess words with repeated letters? Yes.

However, we have not tested B and H.

But wait: in the first guess, did we rule out E being at other positions? No, because we only guessed one E at position5 and it was marked as present. So the E in the word could be at position2? Actually, the secret word could have E at positions 1,2,3,4? But position3 we now know is E.

However, the current known positions: position3=E and position4=C.

So in ""BEECH"", we have E at position2 as well.

But we haven't gotten feedback about E at position2? So it's possible.

But let's list other words to compare.

Other words:

- LEECH: L E E C H -> same issue: E at position2 and position3.

- ""FETCH"": F at position1, E at position2? Pattern: F E T C H -> positions: F E T C H? The pattern requires position3 to be E? But ""FETCH"" has E at position2 and T at position3? Doesn't match.

We need position3 to be E, so the word must have the form: [letter1] [letter2] E C [letter5]

Examples:
- ""WELCH"": W E L C H -> 
  position1: W, position2: E, position3: L? -> Incorrect, because we need position3 to be E.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake: the third letter must be E? How?

""WELCH"": W at1, E at2, L at3, C at4, H at5? That's not E at position3? But we know from the second guess that E is fixed at position3 and C at position4.

Therefore, the word must have E as the third letter and C as the fourth.

So only words of the form: XYECZ, where X, Y, Z are letters.

What are some common words that fit?
- ""DIETIC"" is 6 letters? No.
- ""BEVY"" not 5.
- I recall words like ""ELECT"" but E at position1, then L, E at3, C at4, T at5? But that would be E L E C T? So pattern: letter1=E (but we cannot have E at position1? Why?) Wait, we don't have a constraint on E at position1? Only that position5 cannot be E.

But from the first guess: E was guessed at position5, marked as present but wrong position. That does not prevent E from being at position1? Actually, no: if E were at position1, then when we guessed ""crane"", which had no E at position1, the E at position5 should have been marked as present? And it was.

So E at position1 is possible? But in our case, for the pattern, we are considering position1 to be a letter that is not forbidden.

But note: in the first guess, we had E at position5 and it was marked '-', meaning E is in the word but not at position5. It does not say anything about position1.

Therefore, E can possibly be at position1? But wait, if E were at position1, then in the first guess, we have E at position5: that would be a separate E? Or the same? If only one E, then if the secret word has E at position1, then when we guess E at position5, it should be marked '-' because it's present but wrong position? Correct. So position1 being E is allowed? But we don't have any constraint against it.

Similarly, position2 could be E? Again, possible.

However, we have fixed position3: E.

So let me list words that have E at position3 and C at position4.

Possible words:
- ""BEECH"": B E E C H -> but position2 is E.
- ""LEECH"": L E E C H -> position2 is E.
- ""HEXEC"" not a word.
- ""THEIC"" not common.
- ""ECHOS"" -> but has E at position1? Pattern: E at1, C at2, H at3? Not E at position3.

Common words:
- Actually, the options are limited. 

Another word: 
- ""PIECE"": P I E C E -> but P is ruled out? In the second guess, we had P at position2 and it was marked 'x' meaning not in the word. So we cannot have P in the word. Therefore, ""PIECE"" is not allowed because it has P (at position1).

- ""CHECK"": but C at position1? Not allowed? Because we already placed C at position4? And we haven't forbidden C at position1? We know from the first guess that C at position1 is not correct? So we cannot have C at position1? Correct, so ""CHECK"" is invalid.

But if the word has two C's? Then we could have C at position1? But wait: the first guess had C at position1 and it was marked '-', meaning the secret word contains C but not at position1. Therefore, if there is a C at position1, it would contradict that feedback? Because the dash means that C is in the word, but not at position1. So the secret word cannot have C at position1.

Therefore, position1 cannot be C.

Similarly, what if the secret word has two C's? Then we know one C is at position4, and the other C must be at position 2 or 5? And we would have to account for that. But we haven't seen any indicator of duplicate C yet? Because in the second guess, we had C at position4 and it was marked '✓', so that one is accounted for. If there was another C, we haven't guessed it.

So we must entertain the possibility of two C's? But our next guess might test that.

Back to word patterns: 

We need a word of form: _ _ E C _

Let me search for words that match:

Possible words:
- ""BEACH"": but B E A C H -> position3 is E? Position4 is C. But A is ruled out? We know A is not in the word. So invalid.
- ""BENCH"": B E N C H -> N is ruled out (from first guess). Invalid.
- ""BELCH"": B E L C H -> 
  Position1: B, position2: E, position3: L? No, pattern is first two letters: B E, then L at position3? But we need position3 to be E? This word is B-E-L-C-H? So the third letter is L, not E? 
  We need the third letter to be E. The word must have E as the third letter. So ""BELCH"" does not have E at position3.

Wait: the positions are:
  For ""BELCH"": 
    Position1: B
    Position2: E
    Position3: L
    Position4: C
    Position5: H
  That does not have E at position3? Correct.

We require position3 to be E? Exactly.

Only words with the exact structure: letter1 - letter2 - E - C - letter5.

Some examples:
- ""CHECK"": not allowed because position1 is C (forbidden) and position2 is H -> but forbidden? Not independently, but position1=C is the issue.
- ""CHEEK"": C at position1 -> forbidden? yes? So skip.
- ""BLEED"": not ending with 'C'? Doesn't match.

It's challenging. Let me think:

- ""TOPEC"" not a word.
- ""BIECS"" not a word.

Another idea: ""MECUM"" is not common.

How about ""YECCH""? Not a standard word.

Another common pattern: words like ""SELECT""? But S is ruled out? And the pattern: S E L E C T? Positions: S at1, E at2, L at3? Not E at position3? Doesn't fit.

Wait, I recall words like ""EVICT"": 
  E V I C T: pattern: E at1, V at2, I at3? Not E at position3? Doesn't fit.

Wait, we are missing a common word: ""HENCE"": 
  H E N C E -> 
    Position1: H
    Position2: E (so position2 is E)
    Position3: N -> but we need E at position3? So no.

Perhaps I need to consult a list...

But let's think: 

What words have the third letter as 'E' and fourth as 'C'? 

Examples in English:
- ""ELECT"": but E at1 and L at2, then position3=E, C at4, T at5 -> pattern: E L E C T? But E at position1? 
  That would be: 
    Position1: E
    Position2: L
    Position3: E
    Position4: C
    Position5: T

This fits? Yes, and ""elect"" is a valid word.

But we have E at position1? Is that allowed? We haven't tested E at position1, but also nothing forbidding it? The first guess said E was not at position5? Doesn't rule out position1.

And the word has two E's? That's possible.

Letters: E, L, E, C, T -> so E at position1 and position3.

Also, the word does not contain any forbidden letters: R, A, N, S, P, K.

Check the letter L: not forbidden? We haven't tested L.
Check the letter T: not forbidden? We haven't tested T.

So we can try ""ELECT"".

But let's verify with the previous feedback:

First guess: ""crane"" 
  Secret word: ""ELECT""
  Feedback: 
    C at position1: in ""crane"", C is at position1 -> but ""elect"" has E at position1, not C. So C is present (at position4) but not at position1 -> '-' for C.
    R: not in ""elect"" -> 'x'
    A: not in ""elect"" -> 'x'
    N: not in ""elect"" -> 'x'
    E at position5: ""elect"" has E at position1 and position3? But E at position5: not present? So why was it marked as '-' in the first guess? 

Wait, inconsistency: 

In ""ELECT"": letters: E, L, E, C, T -> so two E's.

When guessing ""crane"":
- E is at position5? The secret word has two E's: one at position1 and one at position3.
- So for E at position5: it should be marked as 'x' because ""ELECT"" does not have an E at position5? But also, since there are E's in the word but already matched? 

Standard Wordle: 
  The feedback is produced by first marking the exact matches. There is no exact match for any letter. Then for the other letters: 
  C is in the secret word but not at position1 -> dash.
  E is in the secret word? Yes, and not at position5? But E in the secret word is at positions 1 and 3? But both are not matched? So since there are two E's in the secret word, and we have only one E in the guess (at position5), then we would mark it as dash? But wait: the position5 E: it should be marked as dash because the secret letter has E at other positions? Even if there are multiple E's, as long as one is available to be matched as wrong position, it gets a dash.

Therefore, for ""crane"" and secret ""ELECT"":
  C: dash (because present, in the secret word at position4 but not matched exactly)
  R: not present -> x
  A: not present -> x
  N: not present -> x
  E: dash (because present, and in secret word at positions 1 and 3? So even if not matched, we mark it as dash since it is present)

So that matches the first feedback: C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)

Second guess: ""speck"" with secret ""ELECT""
  S: not in word -> x
  P: not in word -> x
  E: at position3? Exactly matches -> ✓
  C: at position4 matches -> ✓
  K: not present -> x

Which matches: S(x) P(x) E(✓) C(✓) K(x)

Therefore, ""ELECT"" is a candidate.

But are there other possibilities? 

Another word: ""JECCA"" not a word.

Or ""NEEZY"" not common.

Another common word: 
- ""EXACT"" : but let's see: 
  Position1: E? 
  Position2: X?
  Position3: A? But we need E at position3? Doesn't match.

Another candidate: ""OLEIC""? not common.

But ""ELECT"" seems viable.

Another candidate: ""DIREC"" not a word.

Or ""DEFEC"": not common.

""DEICE"": 
  D E I C E -> 
  Position1: D
  Position2: E
  Position3: I -> not E? We need position3 to be E. So doesn't fit.

So only ""ELECT"" comes to mind? But wait, there might be others.

""ELBEC"" not a word.

""VELCE"" not a word.

""CLEEK"": C L E E K -> but C at position1? Forbidden? And K ruled out? So invalid.

""BLEEP"": B L E E P -> 
  Pattern: B L E (position3) E (position4) P? But we need C at position4? Doesn't work.

Therefore, ""ELECT"" seems a good candidate.

But what about ""EWECS""? Not a word.

Another option: ""BEDEW""? Not matching.

Perhaps ""ELECT"" is the most common word.

But note: in ""ELECT"", position1 is E? And position2 is L? We haven't guessed L.

Now, we have 6 tries, we are at guess 3? So we can guess ""ELECT"".

But alternatively, if we want to test more letters, we could choose a word that doesn't have E at other positions to not assume duplicates? But we don't know.

Let's consider: we know the secret word has E at position3 and C at position4. The first feedback showed E present in the word but not at position5. For ""ELECT"", that is satisfied by E at position1 and/or position3? But we only need one E elsewhere? And we have two? So it fits.

But maybe there are other words without E at position1? 

For example:
- If we avoid position1=E, then what? Position1 and position2 must be different letters.

Let's try ""QUIET""? But Q U I E T does not have C at position4? No.

Another one: ""PLEC"" not 5.

Or ""GRECO"": G R E C O -> but R is ruled out? So invalid.

""WHITE""? Pattern: W H I T E -> no.

Perhaps ""ELECT"" is a candidate.

Another word: ""MEZZO""? not EC at the end.

Perhaps ""ELECT"" is the only common word? But I recall ""FLECK"": F L E C K -> 
  Pattern: F L E C K -> 
    Position3=E, position4=C? Yes. 
  But K is ruled out? (from second guess: K is not in the word). So ""FLECK"" has K at position5? Forbidden. So invalid.

Therefore, I think ""ELECT"" is a valid candidate.

But let's make sure: is there a word like ""THEIC"" -> not common.

""BEVUE"" not matching.

So I'll go with ""ELECT"".

If ""ELECT"" is not the secret word, at least it will give information about E at position1 and L at position2 and T at position5.

But for efficiency, we might choose a word that doesn't duplicate E? No, because we don't know.

But ""ELECT"" is a valid guess.

Therefore, our next guess is ""ELECT"".

But note: we have not tested L and T? So we are testing them.

If we want to be more systematic, we might choose a word that tests new letters? And avoids duplicates? But ""ELECT"" tests L and T? Yes.

Alternative: if we try non-E at position1? For example:
- ""BLECK"" not a word? Or ""BLECS"" not common.
- ""GLECH"" not common.

Another common word? ""BIECS"" not a word.

So I think ""ELECT"" is the best.

<guess>elect</guess>Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
  Meaning:  
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - R, A, N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: speck → Feedback: S(x) P(x) E(✓) C(✓) K(x)**  
  Meaning:  
  - E is in the correct position (position 3).  
  - C is in the correct position (position 4).  
  - S, P, K are not in the word.

**Summary of known information:**  
- The secret word pattern: `[unknown] [unknown] E C [unknown]`.  
- Position 3 = E (fixed).  
- Position 4 = C (fixed).  
- Forbidden letters (not in the word): R, A, N, S, P, K.  
- Position 1 ≠ C (from Guess 1 feedback).  
- Position 5 ≠ E (from Guess 1 feedback).  

Possible letters for positions 1, 2, and 5 include common consonants/vowels not tested yet: B, D, H, I, L, M, O, u, W, Y, etc.  

After evaluating word options that fit the pattern `_ _ E C _` and avoid forbidden letters:
- **""ELECT""** is a valid candidate:  
  - Pattern: `E L E C T` → Position 1 = E, Position 2 = L, Position 3 = E (matches fixed E), Position 4 = C (matches fixed C), Position 5 = T.  
  - E at position 1 is allowed (no constraint against E at position 2 from feedback).  
  - L and T are untested letters, providing new information.  
  - Contains two E’s, which aligns with Guess 1 feedback (E present but not at position 5).  

Testing ""ELECT"" will either win the game or provide critical feedback on the remaining unknown positions and letters.

Does not contain R, A, or N (because they are not in the secret word).\n 2. Contains C and E, but not in the same positions as in ""crane"" (i.e., C cannot be at position 1, E cannot be at position 5).\n 3. We might also want to include other common letters to test.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that are still possible: B, D, H, I, L, O, S, T, U, etc.\n\n We know the word has 5 letters and must include C and E.\n\n Since C cannot be at position 1, and E cannot be at position 5, we can try to place C in a different position and E in a different position.\n\n Also, note that the word does not have R, A, N.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has C and E, and three new letters.\n\n Possibilities: We can try words like ""CLOSE"", ""SCENE"", but note:\n - ""SCENE"" has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed one E and one C, but that doesn\'t rule out duplicates. But since we only have one E marked, if the word had two E\'s, we would have seen at least one E in the correct position or another E marked? Not necessarily: because the E in position 5 was marked as present but wrong position, so there could be another E that we haven\'t seen.\n\n However, to be safe, let\'s avoid assuming duplicates until we have more information.\n\n We also want to test new letters.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have C and E, and avoid R, A, N.\n\n Some options:\n - ""CLOSE"": C at position 1? But wait, in ""crane"", C was at position 1 and we got a \'-\' meaning C is in the word but not at position 1. So we cannot put C at position 1 again. Therefore, ""CLOSE"" is invalid because it puts C at position 1.\n\n We must avoid putting C at position 1 and E at position 5.\n\n Let\'s try ""SCENT"": \n   S at 1, C at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5.\n But wait, we know N is not in the word (from feedback: N was marked as \'x\'). So we cannot use N.\n\n Another option: ""CHOSE"": \n   C at 1? Again, position 1 is not allowed for C.\n\n We need to put C in a position other than 1. So let\'s try to put C at position 2,3,4, or 5.\n\n Similarly, E cannot be at position 5, so we can put E at 1,2,3, or 4.\n\n Example: ""SPICE"": \n   S at 1, P at 2, I at 3, C at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""SPICE"" but rearrange? We need to form a valid word.\n\n Another idea: ""CEILS"" (an old word for chisels? but might not be common) or ""CELEB"" (not 5 letters). \n\n Let\'s think of more common words.\n\n How about ""SCORE""? But we know R is not in the word (from feedback: R was marked as \'x\'), so we cannot use R.\n\n How about ""SCOPE""? \n   S at 1, C at 2, O at 3, P at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n We need to avoid E at position 5.\n\n How about ""EPICS""? \n   E at 1, P at 2, I at 3, C at 4, S at 5.\n This word: \n   E is at position 1 (which is allowed because previously E was at 5 and now it\'s at 1, which is different and not the same as the previous position for E? Actually, the feedback only said that E is not at position 5, so position 1 is fine for E).\n   C is at position 4 (which is not position 1, so that\'s allowed).\n\n Also, the letters are E, P, I, C, S. None of these are R, A, or N.\n\n So ""epics"" is a valid word? Let me confirm: yes, ""epics"" is a word (meaning heroic deeds or grand events).\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SPICE"" but with E not at 5? We can\'t because the word ""spice"" ends with E.\n\n Another option: ""CLIME"" (meaning a region or climate? but not very common). \n\n Or ""CELLO"": but that has two L\'s and we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, C is at position 1 again -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""OUNCE""? But we know N is not in the word (from feedback: N was \'x\'), so we cannot use N.\n\n Another idea: ""DUCHY"": \n   D at 1, U at 2, C at 3, H at 4, Y at 5.\n This uses C at position 3 (which is allowed) and does not use E? But we know E is in the word. So we must include E.\n\n Therefore, we must have a word that includes both C and E.\n\n Let me try to list words that have C and E, and avoid R, A, N, and with C not at 1 and E not at 5.\n\n Possibilities:\n - ""PIECE"": but has two E\'s? And C at position 3? Also, E at position 5 is not allowed. So we cannot use ""PIECE"" because E is at 5.\n\n - ""CHASE"": but has A? We know A is not in the word.\n\n - ""THECE"" (not common).\n\n - ""EXCEL"": \n   E at 1, X at 2, C at 3, E at 4, L at 5.\n   This has two E\'s? But that\'s okay. \n   E at position 1: allowed (since previously E was at 5, so position 1 is new).\n   C at position 3: allowed (not position 1).\n   Also, the word has E at position 4 and 1? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s. \n   However, we must note that the feedback for the first guess only showed one E (at position 5) as present. If the secret word has two E\'s, then we would have seen two \'-\' for two E\'s? Not necessarily: because if one E was in the correct position, it would have been marked as correct. But in our case, the E at position 5 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that there is at least one E in the word that is not at position 5. There could be another E that we haven\'t guessed.\n\n But in ""excel"", we have E at position 1 and 4. We don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s. However, we are allowed to guess words with duplicate letters to test.\n\n But let\'s check the letters: E, X, C, E, L. We are including E and C, and new letters: X, L. Also, no R, A, N.\n\n However, note that the first guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has at least one E that is not at position 5. If we put E at position 1 and 4, that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we must be cautious: if the secret word has only one E, then one of the E\'s in ""excel"" will be marked as present and the other as absent? Actually, the feedback rules: for each letter, if it is in the word, then we mark it as present (either correct position or wrong position) for each occurrence? But the secret word might have only one E, so if we guess two E\'s, one of them might be marked as present and the other as absent? Actually, the feedback is per letter in the guess. For each letter, if the letter is in the secret word and in the correct position, we mark it with a check. If it is in the secret word but not in the correct position, we mark it with a dash. If it is not in the secret word, we mark it with an x.\n\n However, if the secret word has only one E, and we guess two E\'s, then one of the E\'s (the one that is in the correct position) would be marked as check, and the other E (if it is in a position that the secret word does not have an E) would be marked as x? Or if the secret word has one E, and we have two E\'s in the guess, then the one that is in the correct position would be check, and the other would be x. If neither is in the correct position, then one of them would be dash (if the secret word has one E) and the other would be x? Actually, the rule is: the feedback is independent per letter? But no, the feedback accounts for the frequency. For example, if the secret word has one E and we guess two E\'s, then one of the E\'s (the one that matches the position of the E in the secret word) would be check, and the other would be x. If neither matches the position, then the first E (or the one that the game considers) might get the dash and the other x? Actually, the standard Wordle rules: the feedback is given by first marking the exact matches, then the remaining letters in the guess that are in the secret word but not matched are marked as dashes, but only up to the frequency in the secret word.\n\n So if the secret word has one E, and we have two E\'s in the guess, then one of them (if it is in the correct position) would be check, and the other would be x. If neither is in the correct position, then one of them (the first occurrence? or arbitrary?) would be dash and the other x? Actually, the game doesn\'t assign by order of the guess but by the secret word: it will mark the exact matches first, then for the remaining letters in the guess, if the letter is in the secret word but not yet matched (and not over the frequency), it gets a dash.\n\n So to avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid duplicate letters for now.\n\n Therefore, let\'s try to find a word that has C and E, and without duplicate letters, and without R, A, N, and with C not at 1 and E not at 5.\n\n How about ""CLUED"": \n   C at 1? Not allowed.\n\n How about ""SCREW"": but has R and we know R is not in the word.\n\n How about ""SLEPT"": but no C? We must include C.\n\n Another idea: ""SPECK"": \n   S at 1, P at 2, E at 3, C at 4, K at 5.\n   This has E at position 3 (allowed) and C at position 4 (allowed). \n   Letters: S, P, E, C, K -> no R, A, N.\n\n But note: we are including K, which is a new letter.\n\n Is ""SPECK"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPICE"" but we cannot because E is at 5? But in ""SPECK"", E is at 3 and C at 4, and K at 5. So that\'s acceptable.\n\n So let\'s go with ""SPECK"".\n\n We can also consider ""CHECK"", but that has two C\'s? And C at position 1? Not allowed.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""SPECK"".\n\n But wait, we have to consider: the feedback for the first guess said that C is in the word but not at position 1. In ""SPECK"", C is at position 4, which is fine. E is at position 3, which is not position 5, so that\'s fine.\n\n So our next guess: ""SPECK""\n\n<guess>speck</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).\n- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (marked with `-`).\n- R, A, and N are not in the secret word (marked with `x`).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include C and E (since they are confirmed present).\n- C cannot be in position 1 (as per feedback).\n- E cannot be in position 5 (as per feedback).\n- Cannot include R, A, or N (as they are absent).\n- Should prioritize common letters to maximize information.\n\nThe word ""SPECK"" meets all criteria:\n- S (position 1), P (position 2), E (position 3), C (position 4), K (position 5).\n- C is in position 4 (not 1), E is in position 3 (not 5).\n- No R, A, or N.\n- Tests new common letters: S, P, K.\n\n<guess>speck</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: speck -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) E(✓) C(✓) K(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n- C: \'-\' meaning C is in the word, but not at position 1.\n- R: \'x\' not in the word.\n- A: \'x\' not in the word.\n- N: \'x\' not in the word.\n- E: \'-\' meaning E is in the word, but not at position 5.\n\nSecond guess: ""speck""\n- S: \'x\' not in the word.\n- P: \'x\' not in the word.\n- E: \'✓\' meaning E is in the correct position (position 3 of the secret word).\n- C: \'✓\' meaning C is in the correct position (position 4 of the secret word).\n- K: \'x\' not in the word.\n\nFrom the second guess:\n- E is at position 3: so the secret word has E as the 3rd letter.\n- C is at position 4: so the secret word has C as the 4th letter.\n\nAlso, we know from the first guess:\n- The secret word contains C (now we know at position 4) and E (now we know at position 3), and no R, A, N.\n- From the second guess, S, P, K are not in the word.\n\nSo, current knowledge:\n- Positions: \n  - Position 1: unknown but not C (from first guess) and not S (from second guess).\n  - Position 2: unknown.\n  - Position 3: E (fixed).\n  - Position 4: C (fixed).\n  - Position 5: unknown, cannot be E (from first guess) and not K (from second guess).\n\nAdditionally, the word must not contain: R, A, N, S, P, K.\n\nNow, what letters are possible?\nWe know the word has 5 letters: [?, ?, E, C, ?]\n\nWe also know from the first guess that C is present (now placed at position 4) and E is present (now at position 3). Are there any other letters that must be present? The first guess only showed C and E as present (besides the incorrect ones), so we don\'t have information about other letters in the word. But note: the secret word might have repeated letters? However, in the feedback, we haven\'t seen indications of duplicates yet.\n\nBut let\'s reconsider: the first guess had C at position 1 and it was wrong position, and now we have C at position 4 and it\'s correct. Similarly for E: first at 5 (wrong) and now at 3 (correct). Therefore, we have accounted for both C and E.\n\nTherefore, the remaining letters (positions 1, 2, and 5) must be unique letters that are not any of the forbidden ones: R, A, N, S, P, K.\n\nWhat letters have not been tested? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, K. So we can use other common consonants and vowels.\n\nCommon letters: B, D, H, I, L, M, O, U, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe need to form a word with the pattern: _ _ E C _\n\nThe fifth letter cannot be E (from first guess feedback: E was absent at position 5) and cannot be K or the others.\n\nPossible words with this structure? \n\nFor example, we could have:\n- Words ending in H: ""TECH"" is not 5 letters. ""LEECH"" has double E? And has L at position 1 and 2? But our pattern is ? ? E C ?.\n\nPossible valid words:\n- ""CHECK"": but P is already ruled out? No, ""CHECK"" has CH at the beginning? Let\'s see: \n  C H E C K -> but wait, we know C is at position 4, so we cannot have C at position 1? But note: we also know from first guess that C is in the word but not at position 1. In ""CHECK"", the first C is at position 1, which is forbidden. Also, we have an extra C? And K is ruled out.\n\nActually, we cannot have C at position 1 because of the first guess: C in position 1 was marked as \'-\' meaning it should be elsewhere. So position 1 cannot be C.\n\nSimilarly, we have already placed C at position 4.\n\nAnother option: ""WHICH"": W H I C H -> \n  Position 1: W, Position 2: H, Position 3: I? But we need position 3 to be E. So it doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need position 3 to be E and position 4 to be C.\n\nSo pattern: _ _ E C _\n\nSome words that fit:\n- CHIEF: C H I E F -> but pattern would be C at position 1? Not allowed (position 1 cannot be C). Also, position 3 is I, not E.\n\nWe need:\nPosition 1: not C, not S, not R, A, N, not P, not K ... from used letters: avoid R,A,N,S,P,K and C (only at position 1? we know C is at position 4, so we can have C at position 1? No, because first guess: we had C at position 1 and it was not correct, meaning C is not at position 1 in the secret word. So position 1 cannot be C.\n\nSimilarly, position 5 cannot be E and not K, and not the other forbidden letters.\n\nList of possible words ending with E and C? Actually, the word must have E at position 3 and C at position 4.\n\nSo the word structure: [letter1][letter2] E C [letter5]\n\nWith letter1, letter2, letter5 being letters that are not forbidden and not C at position1? Letter1 can be any letter except: C, R, A, N, S, P, K.\n\nSimilarly, letter2: any letter except R,A,N,S,P,K? And letter5: any except E, R,A,N,S,P,K.\n\nAlso, there might be more constraints: we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5? Yes, because E was at position 5 in ""crane"" and got \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So for letter5, it must not be E? Correct.\n\nMoreover, we must not use any of the absent letters: R, A, N, S, P, K.\n\nWhat about the letter in position1? We also know from the first guess that C is present and not at position1, so position1 is open as long as it\'s not one of the forbidden letters.\n\nSimilarly for position2: we have no direct constraint.\n\nNow, what words have this pattern? \n\nCommon words:\n\n- ""BEECH"": \n  B E E C H -> position1: B, position2: E, position3: E, position4: C, position5: H.\n  But note: position3 is E, which is set, and it has E at position2 and position3? That\'s okay? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s.\n\nHowever, let\'s check feedback compatibility: \n  First guess: ""crane"" had E at position5 -> marked as present (wrong position). If the secret word has an E at position3, that was not guessed in first guess? So the E at position5 of the first guess must correspond to one of the E\'s in the secret word? But if the secret word has E only at position3, then the E at position5 in the first guess would be marked as present (because the E is at position3, which is not position5). So that fits.\n\nBut ""beec"" has two E\'s? Actually ""BEECH"": B-E-E-C-H. So position2 is E and position3 is E.\n\nWe are allowed to guess words with repeated letters? Yes.\n\nHowever, we have not tested B and H.\n\nBut wait: in the first guess, did we rule out E being at other positions? No, because we only guessed one E at position5 and it was marked as present. So the E in the word could be at position2? Actually, the secret word could have E at positions 1,2,3,4? But position3 we now know is E.\n\nHowever, the current known positions: position3=E and position4=C.\n\nSo in ""BEECH"", we have E at position2 as well.\n\nBut we haven\'t gotten feedback about E at position2? So it\'s possible.\n\nBut let\'s list other words to compare.\n\nOther words:\n\n- LEECH: L E E C H -> same issue: E at position2 and position3.\n\n- ""FETCH"": F at position1, E at position2? Pattern: F E T C H -> positions: F E T C H? The pattern requires position3 to be E? But ""FETCH"" has E at position2 and T at position3? Doesn\'t match.\n\nWe need position3 to be E, so the word must have the form: [letter1] [letter2] E C [letter5]\n\nExamples:\n- ""WELCH"": W E L C H -> \n  position1: W, position2: E, position3: L? -> Incorrect, because we need position3 to be E.\n\nWait, I think I\'m making a mistake: the third letter must be E? How?\n\n""WELCH"": W at1, E at2, L at3, C at4, H at5? That\'s not E at position3? But we know from the second guess that E is fixed at position3 and C at position4.\n\nTherefore, the word must have E as the third letter and C as the fourth.\n\nSo only words of the form: XYECZ, where X, Y, Z are letters.\n\nWhat are some common words that fit?\n- ""DIETIC"" is 6 letters? No.\n- ""BEVY"" not 5.\n- I recall words like ""ELECT"" but E at position1, then L, E at3, C at4, T at5? But that would be E L E C T? So pattern: letter1=E (but we cannot have E at position1? Why?) Wait, we don\'t have a constraint on E at position1? Only that position5 cannot be E.\n\nBut from the first guess: E was guessed at position5, marked as present but wrong position. That does not prevent E from being at position1? Actually, no: if E were at position1, then when we guessed ""crane"", which had no E at position1, the E at position5 should have been marked as present? And it was.\n\nSo E at position1 is possible? But in our case, for the pattern, we are considering position1 to be a letter that is not forbidden.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had E at position5 and it was marked \'-\', meaning E is in the word but not at position5. It does not say anything about position1.\n\nTherefore, E can possibly be at position1? But wait, if E were at position1, then in the first guess, we have E at position5: that would be a separate E? Or the same? If only one E, then if the secret word has E at position1, then when we guess E at position5, it should be marked \'-\' because it\'s present but wrong position? Correct. So position1 being E is allowed? But we don\'t have any constraint against it.\n\nSimilarly, position2 could be E? Again, possible.\n\nHowever, we have fixed position3: E.\n\nSo let me list words that have E at position3 and C at position4.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BEECH"": B E E C H -> but position2 is E.\n- ""LEECH"": L E E C H -> position2 is E.\n- ""HEXEC"" not a word.\n- ""THEIC"" not common.\n- ""ECHOS"" -> but has E at position1? Pattern: E at1, C at2, H at3? Not E at position3.\n\nCommon words:\n- Actually, the options are limited. \n\nAnother word: \n- ""PIECE"": P I E C E -> but P is ruled out? In the second guess, we had P at position2 and it was marked \'x\' meaning not in the word. So we cannot have P in the word. Therefore, ""PIECE"" is not allowed because it has P (at position1).\n\n- ""CHECK"": but C at position1? Not allowed? Because we already placed C at position4? And we haven\'t forbidden C at position1? We know from the first guess that C at position1 is not correct? So we cannot have C at position1? Correct, so ""CHECK"" is invalid.\n\nBut if the word has two C\'s? Then we could have C at position1? But wait: the first guess had C at position1 and it was marked \'-\', meaning the secret word contains C but not at position1. Therefore, if there is a C at position1, it would contradict that feedback? Because the dash means that C is in the word, but not at position1. So the secret word cannot have C at position1.\n\nTherefore, position1 cannot be C.\n\nSimilarly, what if the secret word has two C\'s? Then we know one C is at position4, and the other C must be at position 2 or 5? And we would have to account for that. But we haven\'t seen any indicator of duplicate C yet? Because in the second guess, we had C at position4 and it was marked \'✓\', so that one is accounted for. If there was another C, we haven\'t guessed it.\n\nSo we must entertain the possibility of two C\'s? But our next guess might test that.\n\nBack to word patterns: \n\nWe need a word of form: _ _ E C _\n\nLet me search for words that match:\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BEACH"": but B E A C H -> position3 is E? Position4 is C. But A is ruled out? We know A is not in the word. So invalid.\n- ""BENCH"": B E N C H -> N is ruled out (from first guess). Invalid.\n- ""BELCH"": B E L C H -> \n  Position1: B, position2: E, position3: L? No, pattern is first two letters: B E, then L at position3? But we need position3 to be E? This word is B-E-L-C-H? So the third letter is L, not E? \n  We need the third letter to be E. The word must have E as the third letter. So ""BELCH"" does not have E at position3.\n\nWait: the positions are:\n  For ""BELCH"": \n    Position1: B\n    Position2: E\n    Position3: L\n    Position4: C\n    Position5: H\n  That does not have E at position3? Correct.\n\nWe require position3 to be E? Exactly.\n\nOnly words with the exact structure: letter1 - letter2 - E - C - letter5.\n\nSome examples:\n- ""CHECK"": not allowed because position1 is C (forbidden) and position2 is H -> but forbidden? Not independently, but position1=C is the issue.\n- ""CHEEK"": C at position1 -> forbidden? yes? So skip.\n- ""BLEED"": not ending with \'C\'? Doesn\'t match.\n\nIt\'s challenging. Let me think:\n\n- ""TOPEC"" not a word.\n- ""BIECS"" not a word.\n\nAnother idea: ""MECUM"" is not common.\n\nHow about ""YECCH""? Not a standard word.\n\nAnother common pattern: words like ""SELECT""? But S is ruled out? And the pattern: S E L E C T? Positions: S at1, E at2, L at3? Not E at position3? Doesn\'t fit.\n\nWait, I recall words like ""EVICT"": \n  E V I C T: pattern: E at1, V at2, I at3? Not E at position3? Doesn\'t fit.\n\nWait, we are missing a common word: ""HENCE"": \n  H E N C E -> \n    Position1: H\n    Position2: E (so position2 is E)\n    Position3: N -> but we need E at position3? So no.\n\nPerhaps I need to consult a list...\n\nBut let\'s think: \n\nWhat words have the third letter as \'E\' and fourth as \'C\'? \n\nExamples in English:\n- ""ELECT"": but E at1 and L at2, then position3=E, C at4, T at5 -> pattern: E L E C T? But E at position1? \n  That would be: \n    Position1: E\n    Position2: L\n    Position3: E\n    Position4: C\n    Position5: T\n\nThis fits? Yes, and ""elect"" is a valid word.\n\nBut we have E at position1? Is that allowed? We haven\'t tested E at position1, but also nothing forbidding it? The first guess said E was not at position5? Doesn\'t rule out position1.\n\nAnd the word has two E\'s? That\'s possible.\n\nLetters: E, L, E, C, T -> so E at position1 and position3.\n\nAlso, the word does not contain any forbidden letters: R, A, N, S, P, K.\n\nCheck the letter L: not forbidden? We haven\'t tested L.\nCheck the letter T: not forbidden? We haven\'t tested T.\n\nSo we can try ""ELECT"".\n\nBut let\'s verify with the previous feedback:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane"" \n  Secret word: ""ELECT""\n  Feedback: \n    C at position1: in ""crane"", C is at position1 -> but ""elect"" has E at position1, not C. So C is present (at position4) but not at position1 -> \'-\' for C.\n    R: not in ""elect"" -> \'x\'\n    A: not in ""elect"" -> \'x\'\n    N: not in ""elect"" -> \'x\'\n    E at position5: ""elect"" has E at position1 and position3? But E at position5: not present? So why was it marked as \'-\' in the first guess? \n\nWait, inconsistency: \n\nIn ""ELECT"": letters: E, L, E, C, T -> so two E\'s.\n\nWhen guessing ""crane"":\n- E is at position5? The secret word has two E\'s: one at position1 and one at position3.\n- So for E at position5: it should be marked as \'x\' because ""ELECT"" does not have an E at position5? But also, since there are E\'s in the word but already matched? \n\nStandard Wordle: \n  The feedback is produced by first marking the exact matches. There is no exact match for any letter. Then for the other letters: \n  C is in the secret word but not at position1 -> dash.\n  E is in the secret word? Yes, and not at position5? But E in the secret word is at positions 1 and 3? But both are not matched? So since there are two E\'s in the secret word, and we have only one E in the guess (at position5), then we would mark it as dash? But wait: the position5 E: it should be marked as dash because the secret letter has E at other positions? Even if there are multiple E\'s, as long as one is available to be matched as wrong position, it gets a dash.\n\nTherefore, for ""crane"" and secret ""ELECT"":\n  C: dash (because present, in the secret word at position4 but not matched exactly)\n  R: not present -> x\n  A: not present -> x\n  N: not present -> x\n  E: dash (because present, and in secret word at positions 1 and 3? So even if not matched, we mark it as dash since it is present)\n\nSo that matches the first feedback: C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n\nSecond guess: ""speck"" with secret ""ELECT""\n  S: not in word -> x\n  P: not in word -> x\n  E: at position3? Exactly matches -> ✓\n  C: at position4 matches -> ✓\n  K: not present -> x\n\nWhich matches: S(x) P(x) E(✓) C(✓) K(x)\n\nTherefore, ""ELECT"" is a candidate.\n\nBut are there other possibilities? \n\nAnother word: ""JECCA"" not a word.\n\nOr ""NEEZY"" not common.\n\nAnother common word: \n- ""EXACT"" : but let\'s see: \n  Position1: E? \n  Position2: X?\n  Position3: A? But we need E at position3? Doesn\'t match.\n\nAnother candidate: ""OLEIC""? not common.\n\nBut ""ELECT"" seems viable.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DIREC"" not a word.\n\nOr ""DEFEC"": not common.\n\n""DEICE"": \n  D E I C E -> \n  Position1: D\n  Position2: E\n  Position3: I -> not E? We need position3 to be E. So doesn\'t fit.\n\nSo only ""ELECT"" comes to mind? But wait, there might be others.\n\n""ELBEC"" not a word.\n\n""VELCE"" not a word.\n\n""CLEEK"": C L E E K -> but C at position1? Forbidden? And K ruled out? So invalid.\n\n""BLEEP"": B L E E P -> \n  Pattern: B L E (position3) E (position4) P? But we need C at position4? Doesn\'t work.\n\nTherefore, ""ELECT"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut what about ""EWECS""? Not a word.\n\nAnother option: ""BEDEW""? Not matching.\n\nPerhaps ""ELECT"" is the most common word.\n\nBut note: in ""ELECT"", position1 is E? And position2 is L? We haven\'t guessed L.\n\nNow, we have 6 tries, we are at guess 3? So we can guess ""ELECT"".\n\nBut alternatively, if we want to test more letters, we could choose a word that doesn\'t have E at other positions to not assume duplicates? But we don\'t know.\n\nLet\'s consider: we know the secret word has E at position3 and C at position4. The first feedback showed E present in the word but not at position5. For ""ELECT"", that is satisfied by E at position1 and/or position3? But we only need one E elsewhere? And we have two? So it fits.\n\nBut maybe there are other words without E at position1? \n\nFor example:\n- If we avoid position1=E, then what? Position1 and position2 must be different letters.\n\nLet\'s try ""QUIET""? But Q U I E T does not have C at position4? No.\n\nAnother one: ""PLEC"" not 5.\n\nOr ""GRECO"": G R E C O -> but R is ruled out? So invalid.\n\n""WHITE""? Pattern: W H I T E -> no.\n\nPerhaps ""ELECT"" is a candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""MEZZO""? not EC at the end.\n\nPerhaps ""ELECT"" is the only common word? But I recall ""FLECK"": F L E C K -> \n  Pattern: F L E C K -> \n    Position3=E, position4=C? Yes. \n  But K is ruled out? (from second guess: K is not in the word). So ""FLECK"" has K at position5? Forbidden. So invalid.\n\nTherefore, I think ""ELECT"" is a valid candidate.\n\nBut let\'s make sure: is there a word like ""THEIC"" -> not common.\n\n""BEVUE"" not matching.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ELECT"".\n\nIf ""ELECT"" is not the secret word, at least it will give information about E at position1 and L at position2 and T at position5.\n\nBut for efficiency, we might choose a word that doesn\'t duplicate E? No, because we don\'t know.\n\nBut ""ELECT"" is a valid guess.\n\nTherefore, our next guess is ""ELECT"".\n\nBut note: we have not tested L and T? So we are testing them.\n\nIf we want to be more systematic, we might choose a word that tests new letters? And avoids duplicates? But ""ELECT"" tests L and T? Yes.\n\nAlternative: if we try non-E at position1? For example:\n- ""BLECK"" not a word? Or ""BLECS"" not common.\n- ""GLECH"" not common.\n\nAnother common word? ""BIECS"" not a word.\n\nSo I think ""ELECT"" is the best.\n\n<guess>elect</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  \n  Meaning:  \n  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  \n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  \n  - R, A, N are not in the word.\n\n- **Guess 2: speck → Feedback: S(x) P(x) E(✓) C(✓) K(x)**  \n  Meaning:  \n  - E is in the correct position (position 3).  \n  - C is in the correct position (position 4).  \n  - S, P, K are not in the word.\n\n**Summary of known information:**  \n- The secret word pattern: `[unknown] [unknown] E C [unknown]`.  \n- Position 3 = E (fixed).  \n- Position 4 = C (fixed).  \n- Forbidden letters (not in the word): R, A, N, S, P, K.  \n- Position 1 ≠ C (from Guess 1 feedback).  \n- Position 5 ≠ E (from Guess 1 feedback).  \n\nPossible letters for positions 1, 2, and 5 include common consonants/vowels not tested yet: B, D, H, I, L, M, O, u, W, Y, etc.  \n\nAfter evaluating word options that fit the pattern `_ _ E C _` and avoid forbidden letters:\n- **""ELECT""** is a valid candidate:  \n  - Pattern: `E L E C T` → Position 1 = E, Position 2 = L, Position 3 = E (matches fixed E), Position 4 = C (matches fixed C), Position 5 = T.  \n  - E at position 1 is allowed (no constraint against E at position 2 from feedback).  \n  - L and T are untested letters, providing new information.  \n  - Contains two E’s, which aligns with Guess 1 feedback (E present but not at position 5).  \n\nTesting ""ELECT"" will either win the game or provide critical feedback on the remaining unknown positions and letters.\n\n<guess>elect</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: speck -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) E(✓) C(✓) K(x)\nGuess 3: elect -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) E(✓) C(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for ""elect"":
  E (position1): '-' meaning E is in the secret word but not at position1.
  L (position2): '-' meaning L is in the secret word but not at position2.
  E (position3): '✓' meaning E is at the correct position (which we already knew).
  C (position4): '✓' meaning C is at the correct position (which we already knew).
  T (position5): 'x' meaning T is not in the secret word.

 We know:
  - Positions: 
      Pos1: ? 
      Pos2: ?
      Pos3: E (fixed)
      Pos4: C (fixed)
      Pos5: ?
  - The secret word has E (at least at pos3) and also has L (but not at pos2). 
      Additionally, note that the first letter E in ""elect"" was marked as '-', so the secret word contains E but not at pos1? 
      But we already know E is at pos3? So what does that dash for the first E mean?
        It means that there is at least one other E in the word? Or it could refer to the same E?
        However, in Wordle rules, if there is only one E in the word and we put an E in a wrong position, it gets '-'. But we also have an E at the correct position (position3) that we already marked as correct.

      Actually, the presence of the dash at position1 E indicates that there is at least one more E in the word? Because the E at position3 is already used for the exact match? 

      How it works: 
        The secret word has E at position3? and if it has another E at another position, then the E at position1 would get a dash? 
        If the secret word has only one E (at position3), then the E at position1 should be marked 'x'? Because we have no extra E? 

      But in the feedback for ""elect"": 
        Position1 E: dash -> meaning E is in word but not at position1? 
        Position2 L: dash -> meaning L is in word but not at position2?
        Position3 E: check -> meaning correct
        Position4 C: check -> meaning correct
        Position5 T: x

      Therefore, the dash for position1 E implies that there is at least one E in the secret word that is not at position3? Or not? Actually, the E at position3 is already matched? So for the E at position1, if there was only one E, it would be marked as absent? But it is marked as present? Therefore, there must be more than one E in the secret word? Specifically, E must appear in a position other than 3? 

      Therefore, the secret word has at least two E's: one at position3 and another at some other position? 

      Also, L is in the word? But not at position2? So L must be at position1, 5? Or maybe at position3? No, position3 is E? So L is either at position1 or position5.

      And we know T is not in the word? So position5 cannot be T.

 Now, putting it together:

  Pattern: [a][b]E C[d] 
      where a, b, d are letters to guess.

  Constraints:
    - The secret word has at least two E's? So positions a, b, or d must have E? 
    - Also, L is in the word? And since position2 is not L? So L must be at position1 or position5? 
    - Moreover, position5 cannot be E? (from first guess feedback: E not at position5)? Therefore, the position5 must be L? or if not L, then some other letter? But L must be at either position1 or position5.

    Why? The secret word has L? and it cannot be at position2 (from feedback) and cannot be at position3 (E fixed) or position4 (C fixed). So only positions left: 1 or 5.

    Similarly, the extra E must be at position1, 2, or 5? But position2 is b? So possible positions for an extra E: 1, 2, or 5? But position5 cannot be E? Therefore, the extra E must be at position1 or position2? 

    But we have position1: if it is E? But the feedback marked E at position1 as dash? Meaning E is present? but not at position1? Contradiction? 

    Let me reexamine: 
      In ""elect"", position1 E was marked as dash? 
        This means: the secret word has an extra E (because the E at position3 is accounted for), and that extra E is not at position1? 

      Therefore, the extra E must be at either position2 or position5? But position5 cannot be E? So the extra E must be at position2? 

      Therefore, position2 must be E? 

    Also, for L: the feedback marked position2 L? as dash? meaning L is in the secret word but not at position2? 

    And since L must be at position1 or position5? But if position2 is E? then position2 cannot be L? So that dash is consistent with E at position2? 

    Therefore, we can conclude:
      The secret word has E at position2? and also at position3? 
      Then, position2 must be E? 

    And L must be at position1 or position5? 

    And position5 cannot be E (already known) and cannot be T (new).

    Position1: must be L? or something else? 

    So the pattern becomes: 
      Position1: ? 
      Position2: E (new)
      Position3: E (fixed)
      Position4: C (fixed)
      Position5: ?

    And the secret word must contain L? in position1 or position5? 

    And the word must have exactly three E's? Or at least two? Since we have two E's accounted for (position2 and position3), that matches the dash for position1 E? How? 

    Explanation: 
      We guessed: position1=E, position2=L, position3=E, position4=C, position5=T 
        -> secret word: 
          position1: ? (not E because dash) 
          position2: must be E? 
          position3: E -> matches
          position4: C -> matches
          position5: ? (must be L? or other?)

    But the feedback tells us:
      position1 E: dash -> meaning there is an E in secret not at position1? 
      position2 L: dash -> meaning there is an L in secret not at position2? 
      So if the secret word has E at position2? That E would account for the dash at position1: because we have an E in the word at position2 (not at position1)? 
      So yes: the secret word should have E at position2? 

    How about the L? 
      The dash at position2 L means there must be an L elsewhere? Only at position1 or position5? 

    Therefore, the secret word has E at position2? So position2 = E.

    Now, the pattern is: position1=?, position2=E, position3=E, position4=C, position5=?

    But wait: if position2 must be E? Then we have:
      Position1: must be a letter? 
      Position5: must be a letter? 

    And L must be either at position1 or position5? 

    Also, forbidden letters: R, A, N, S, P, K, T? 

    And position1 cannot be E? (because the dash for position1 E? and we have already placed E at position2 and position3). 

    But position1 E was marked as dash? which means that the secret word contains E? but not at position1? So even if we have E at position2 and position3? it's okay? because we have an E not at position1? 

    So position2=E? 

    Therefore, the current pattern: [letter1] E E C [letter5]

    And letter1 must not be any of: E, R,A,N,S,P,K,T? 

    Similarly, letter5 must not be E? (and also not R,A,N,S,P,K,T)? 

    Also, L must be in the word? so either letter1=L? or letter5=L? 

    So possible words:

      Option1: L E E C ? -> but letter5 must be non-E? 
        Word: ""LEEC?"" 
        Possible: ""LEECH"" -> 
          L at position1, E at2, E at3, C at4, H at5? 
          But H is not forbidden? 

      Option2: ? E E C L -> pattern: letter1 E E C L -> word: ""LEECL"" not a word? 
        Common word: ""EECHL"" not a word? 

    Actually, ""LEECH"" is a word? Meaning: a bloodsucking worm? 

    And let's check constraints:
      Position1: L -> which satisfies the required L? 
      Position5: H -> not forbidden? 

    Also, the word does not contain any forbidden letters: R,A,N,S,P,K,T? 

    What about the extra E? We have two E's? at positions2 and3? 

    Let's verify against the feedback of ""elect"":

      Secret ""LEECH"": 
        Guess: ""elect"" = E L E C T
        Feedback per letter:

          Position1: E? 
            Secret: L -> not E? 
            But E is in the secret word? at positions2 and3? So we mark this E as present with dash? -> '-'
          Position2: L?
            Secret: E -> not L? 
            But L is in the secret word at position1? So mark L as present with dash? -> '-'
          Position3: E -> matches secret E? -> '✓'
          Position4: C -> matches? -> '✓'
          Position5: T? Secret: H? T not in secret? -> 'x'

        So feedback: E(-) L(-) E(✓) C(✓) T(x) -> matches.

    Therefore, ""LEECH"" is a candidate? 

    But note: the first guess ""crane"":
        C at position1: secret LEECH? has C at position4? so C is present? -> '-'
        R: not present? -> 'x'
        A: not present? -> 'x'
        N: not present? -> 'x'
        E at position5: secret LEECH has E at positions2 and3? So it has E? and not at position5? -> dash? -> '-'

        So matches.

    Second guess ""speck"":
        S: no? -> x
        P: no? -> x
        E at position3: matches? -> ✓
        C at position4: matches? -> ✓
        K: no? -> x

        Also matches? 

    Therefore, ""LEECH"" is a candidate? However, note that we have two E's? 

    Is there another candidate?

    What if L is at position5? 

      Pattern: ? E E C L 

      Are there words like ""WEECL""? Not common? 
      ""EEVCL""? Not common? 

      Maybe ""EETCL""? Not a word? 

      So it seems ""LEECH"" is the only common candidate? 

    But note: we also have ""LEEPS""? Not common? and 'S' is ruled out? 

    What about ""BEECH"": 
      But B at position1? 
      Pattern: B E E C H? 
      But L must be in the word? but ""BEECH"" has B,E,E,C,H? No L? 

      Therefore, ""LEECH"" is the candidate? 

    But wait: the requirement of L? 
      If we guess ""LEECH"", it has L at position1? 

    So our next guess should be ""LEECH""? 

    We are at guess 4? We have 6 tries? So we can try.

    But note: in ""LEECH"", position5 is H? We haven't guessed H? So we are testing a new letter.

    Alternatively, we might be able to think of other words? 

    But let me note: the secret word must have:
      position2: E
      position3: E
      position4: C
      and have L? at position1 or position5? 

    And position5 cannot be E? 

    If L is at position5? then the word: ? E E C L? 

    Words: 
      ""FEECL""? Not a word? 
      ""VEECO""? Not common? 

      So ""LEECH"" seems the only viable candidate? 

    Another possibility: ""MECUM""? Not matching? 

    So I think ""LEECH"" is the guess.

    Therefore, we return ""leech"".

    But note: the word ""LEECH"" ends with H? 

    And we don't know if H is in the word? But we are testing.

    However, the feedback from ""elect"" gives additional constraint: T is absent? 

    And ""LEECH"" does not have T? 

    So we can guess ""LEECH"".

<guess>leech</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from ""elect"" and previous guesses:  
- **Feedback for Guess 3: elect → E(-) L(-) E(✓) C(✓) T(x)**  
  - Position 1: E is in the word but not at position 1.  
  - Position 2: L is in the word but not at position 2.  
  - Position 3: E is correct.  
  - Position 4: C is correct.  
  - Position 5: T is not in the word.  

### Key Inferences:  
1. **Position 3 = E**, **Position 4 = C** (confirmed).  
2. **Secret word has at least two E's**:  
   - The `-` for E at position 1 indicates an additional E in the word (beyond position 3).  
   - Position 1 ≠ E (rule-out) and position 5 ≠ E (from Guess 1).  
   → **Extra E must be at position 2** → **Position 2 = E**.  
3. **L must be in the word**:  
   - `-` for L at position 2 confirms L is present but not at position 2.  
   - With positions 3 (E) and 4 (C) fixed, L can only be at position 1 or 5.  
4. **Forbidden letters**: R, A, N, S, P, K, T (absent per previous feedback).  
5. **Pattern**: `[Position 1]` E E C `[Position 5]`  
   - Position 1: Cannot be E/Forbidden letters; must be L (else L must be at position 5).  
   - Position 5: Cannot be E or forbidden letters; must be L if position 1 isn't L.  

### Viable Word:  
- **""LEECH""** fits all criteria:  
  - Pattern: **L** E E C **H**  (L at position 1, H at position 5).  
  - Contains L (required) and two E's (positions 2 and 3).  
  - Uses valid positions: Position 2 = E (required), position 3 = E, position 4 = C.  
  - Avoids forbidden letters (R,A,N,S,P,K,T).  

This guess tests L and H while adhering to all constraints. If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, it provides critical feedback.  

<guess>leech</guess>",leech,"We are given feedback for ""elect"":
  E (position1): '-' meaning E is in the secret word but not at position1.
  L (position2): '-' meaning L is in the secret word but not at position2.
  E (position3): '✓' meaning E is at the correct position (which we already knew).
  C (position4): '✓' meaning C is at the correct position (which we already knew).

      Pos4: C (fixed)
      Pos5: ?
  - The secret word has E (at least at pos3) and also has L (but not at pos2). 
      Additionally, note that the first letter E in ""elect"" was marked as '-', so the secret word contains E but not at pos1? 
      But we already know E is at pos3? So what does that dash for the first E mean?
        It means that there is at least one other E in the word? Or it could refer to the same E?
        However, in Wordle rules, if there is only one E in the word and we put an E in a wrong position, it gets '-'. But we also have an E at the correct position (position3) that we already marked as correct.

      Actually, the presence of the dash at position1 E indicates that there is at least one more E in the word? Because the E at position3 is already used for the exact match? 

      How it works: 
        The secret word has E at position3? and if it has another E at another position, then the E at position1 would get a dash? 
        If the secret word has only one E (at position3), then the E at position1 should be marked 'x'? Because we have no extra E? 

      But in the feedback for ""elect"": 
        Position1 E: dash -> meaning E is in word but not at position1? 
        Position2 L: dash -> meaning L is in word but not at position2?

      Therefore, the dash for position1 E implies that there is at least one E in the secret word that is not at position3? Or not? Actually, the E at position3 is already matched? So for the E at position1, if there was only one E, it would be marked as absent? But it is marked as present? Therefore, there must be more than one E in the secret word? Specifically, E must appear in a position other than 3? 

      Therefore, the secret word has at least two E's: one at position3 and another at some other position? 

      Also, L is in the word? But not at position2? So L must be at position1, 5? Or maybe at position3? No, position3 is E? So L is either at position1 or position5.

      And we know T is not in the word? So position5 cannot be T.

 Now, putting it together:

  Pattern: [a][b]E C[d] 
      where a, b, d are letters to guess.

  Constraints:
    - The secret word has at least two E's? So positions a, b, or d must have E? 
    - Also, L is in the word? And since position2 is not L? So L must be at position1 or position5? 
    - Moreover, position5 cannot be E? (from first guess feedback: E not at position5)? Therefore, the position5 must be L? or if not L, then some other letter? But L must be at either position1 or position5.

    Why? The secret word has L? and it cannot be at position2 (from feedback) and cannot be at position3 (E fixed) or position4 (C fixed). So only positions left: 1 or 5.

    Similarly, the extra E must be at position1, 2, or 5? But position2 is b? So possible positions for an extra E: 1, 2, or 5? But position5 cannot be E? Therefore, the extra E must be at position1 or position2? 

    But we have position1: if it is E? But the feedback marked E at position1 as dash? Meaning E is present? but not at position1? Contradiction? 

    Let me reexamine: 
      In ""elect"", position1 E was marked as dash? 
        This means: the secret word has an extra E (because the E at position3 is accounted for), and that extra E is not at position1? 

      Therefore, the extra E must be at either position2 or position5? But position5 cannot be E? So the extra E must be at position2? 

      Therefore, position2 must be E? 

    Also, for L: the feedback marked position2 L? as dash? meaning L is in the secret word but not at position2? 

    And since L must be at position1 or position5? But if position2 is E? then position2 cannot be L? So that dash is consistent with E at position2? 

    Therefore, we can conclude:
      The secret word has E at position2? and also at position3? 
      Then, position2 must be E? 

    And L must be at position1 or position5? 

    And position5 cannot be E (already known) and cannot be T (new).

    Position1: must be L? or something else? 

    So the pattern becomes: 
      Position1: ? 
      Position2: E (new)
      Position3: E (fixed)
      Position4: C (fixed)
      Position5: ?

    And the secret word must contain L? in position1 or position5? 

    And the word must have exactly three E's? Or at least two? Since we have two E's accounted for (position2 and position3), that matches the dash for position1 E? How? 

    Explanation: 
      We guessed: position1=E, position2=L, position3=E, position4=C, position5=T 
        -> secret word: 
          position1: ? (not E because dash) 
          position2: must be E? 
          position3: E -> matches
          position4: C -> matches
          position5: ? (must be L? or other?)

    But the feedback tells us:
      position1 E: dash -> meaning there is an E in secret not at position1? 
      position2 L: dash -> meaning there is an L in secret not at position2? 
      So if the secret word has E at position2? That E would account for the dash at position1: because we have an E in the word at position2 (not at position1)? 
      So yes: the secret word should have E at position2? 

    How about the L? 
      The dash at position2 L means there must be an L elsewhere? Only at position1 or position5? 

    Therefore, the secret word has E at position2? So position2 = E.

    Now, the pattern is: position1=?, position2=E, position3=E, position4=C, position5=?

    But wait: if position2 must be E? Then we have:
      Position1: must be a letter? 
      Position5: must be a letter? 

    And L must be either at position1 or position5? 

    Also, forbidden letters: R, A, N, S, P, K, T? 

    And position1 cannot be E? (because the dash for position1 E? and we have already placed E at position2 and position3). 

    But position1 E was marked as dash? which means that the secret word contains E? but not at position1? So even if we have E at position2 and position3? it's okay? because we have an E not at position1? 

    So position2=E? 

    Therefore, the current pattern: [letter1] E E C [letter5]

    And letter1 must not be any of: E, R,A,N,S,P,K,T? 

    Similarly, letter5 must not be E? (and also not R,A,N,S,P,K,T)? 

    Also, L must be in the word? so either letter1=L? or letter5=L? 

    So possible words:

      Option1: L E E C ? -> but letter5 must be non-E? 
        Word: ""LEEC?"" 
        Possible: ""LEECH"" -> 
          L at position1, E at2, E at3, C at4, H at5? 
          But H is not forbidden? 

      Option2: ? E E C L -> pattern: letter1 E E C L -> word: ""LEECL"" not a word? 
        Common word: ""EECHL"" not a word? 

    Actually, ""LEECH"" is a word? Meaning: a bloodsucking worm? 

    And let's check constraints:
      Position1: L -> which satisfies the required L? 
      Position5: H -> not forbidden? 

    Also, the word does not contain any forbidden letters: R,A,N,S,P,K,T? 

    What about the extra E? We have two E's? at positions2 and3? 

    Let's verify against the feedback of ""elect"":

      Secret ""LEECH"": 
        Guess: ""elect"" = E L E C T
        Feedback per letter:

          Position1: E? 
            Secret: L -> not E? 
            But E is in the secret word? at positions2 and3? So we mark this E as present with dash? -> '-'
          Position2: L?
            Secret: E -> not L? 
            But L is in the secret word at position1? So mark L as present with dash? -> '-'
          Position3: E -> matches secret E? -> '✓'
          Position4: C -> matches? -> '✓'
          Position5: T? Secret: H? T not in secret? -> 'x'

        So feedback: E(-) L(-) E(✓) C(✓) T(x) -> matches.

    Therefore, ""LEECH"" is a candidate? 

    But note: the first guess ""crane"":
        C at position1: secret LEECH? has C at position4? so C is present? -> '-'
        R: not present? -> 'x'
        A: not present? -> 'x'
        N: not present? -> 'x'
        E at position5: secret LEECH has E at positions2 and3? So it has E? and not at position5? -> dash? -> '-'

        So matches.

    Second guess ""speck"":
        S: no? -> x
        P: no? -> x
        E at position3: matches? -> ✓
        C at position4: matches? -> ✓
        K: no? -> x

        Also matches? 

    Therefore, ""LEECH"" is a candidate? However, note that we have two E's? 

    Is there another candidate?

    What if L is at position5? 

      Pattern: ? E E C L 

      Are there words like ""WEECL""? Not common? 
      ""EEVCL""? Not common? 

      Maybe ""EETCL""? Not a word? 

      So it seems ""LEECH"" is the only common candidate? 

    But note: we also have ""LEEPS""? Not common? and 'S' is ruled out? 

    What about ""BEECH"": 
      But B at position1? 
      Pattern: B E E C H? 
      But L must be in the word? but ""BEECH"" has B,E,E,C,H? No L? 

      Therefore, ""LEECH"" is the candidate? 

    But wait: the requirement of L? 
      If we guess ""LEECH"", it has L at position1? 

    So our next guess should be ""LEECH""? 

    We are at guess 4? We have 6 tries? So we can try.

    But note: in ""LEECH"", position5 is H? We haven't guessed H? So we are testing a new letter.

    Alternatively, we might be able to think of other words? 

    But let me note: the secret word must have:
      position2: E
      position3: E
      position4: C
      and have L? at position1 or position5? 

    And position5 cannot be E? 

    If L is at position5? then the word: ? E E C L? 

    Words: 
      ""FEECL""? Not a word? 
      ""VEECO""? Not common? 

      So ""LEECH"" seems the only viable candidate? 

    Another possibility: ""MECUM""? Not matching? 

    So I think ""LEECH"" is the guess.

    Therefore, we return ""leech"".

    But note: the word ""LEECH"" ends with H? 

    And we don't know if H is in the word? But we are testing.

    However, the feedback from ""elect"" gives additional constraint: T is absent? 

    And ""LEECH"" does not have T? 

    So we can guess ""LEECH"".

<guess>leech</guess>Based on the feedback from ""elect"" and previous guesses:  
- **Feedback for Guess 3: elect → E(-) L(-) E(✓) C(✓) T(x)**  
  - Position 1: E is in the word but not at position 1.  
  - Position 2: L is in the word but not at position 2.  
  - Position 3: E is correct.  
  - Position 4: C is correct.  
  - Position 5: T is not in the word.  

### Key Inferences:  
1. **Position 3 = E**, **Position 4 = C** (confirmed).  
2. **Secret word has at least two E's**:  
   - The `-` for E at position 1 indicates an additional E in the word (beyond position 3).  
   - Position 1 ≠ E (rule-out) and position 5 ≠ E (from Guess 1).  
   → **Extra E must be at position 2** → **Position 2 = E**.  
3. **L must be in the word**:  
   - `-` for L at position 2 confirms L is present but not at position 2.  
   - With positions 3 (E) and 4 (C) fixed, L can only be at position 1 or 5.  
4. **Forbidden letters**: R, A, N, S, P, K, T (absent per previous feedback).  
5. **Pattern**: `[Position 1]` E E C `[Position 5]`  
   - Position 1: Cannot be E/Forbidden letters; must be L (else L must be at position 5).  
   - Position 5: Cannot be E or forbidden letters; must be L if position 1 isn't L.  

### Viable Word:  
- **""LEECH""** fits all criteria:  
  - Pattern: **L** E E C **H**  (L at position 1, H at position 5).  
  - Contains L (required) and two E's (positions 2 and 3).  
  - Uses valid positions: Position 2 = E (required), position 3 = E, position 4 = C.  
  - Avoids forbidden letters (R,A,N,S,P,K,T).  

This guess tests L and H while adhering to all constraints. If correct, it solves the puzzle; if not, it provides critical feedback.",Guess 4: leech -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) E(✓) E(✓) C(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
