We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: ✓ (correct position)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: ✓ (correct position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, the secret word has:
   - 'C' as the first letter (position 1)
   - 'A' as the third letter (position 3)
   - The letters 'R', 'N', and 'E' are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word is of the form: C _ A _ _

 We know that the second letter cannot be 'R', and the fourth and fifth letters cannot be 'N' or 'E'. Also, the word does not contain 'R', 'N', or 'E'.

 We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word that fits the known information.

 Constraints:
   Position 1: 'C'
   Position 3: 'A'
   The word must not contain: R, N, E

 Also, we want to test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

 Let's think of words that start with 'C', have 'A' in the third position, and avoid R, N, E.

 Some possibilities:
   CHALK: C H A L K -> H in position 2, L in 4, K in 5. But we don't know if these are in the word.
   CHAMP: C H A M P
   CHASM: C H A S M
   CLAWS: C L A W S -> but L is in position 2, which we don't know about.

 However, note that in the first guess, we had 'R' and it was absent, so we avoid R.

 Let me list some words that fit the pattern C _ A _ _ and do not contain R, N, E.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, etc.

 We can try to use a word that has new letters to get more information.

 Consider: ""CHAOS"" -> C H A O S
   But does it have R, N, E? No. So it's acceptable.

 However, we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn't show any repeated letters so far, but we don't know.

 Another option: ""CHASM"" -> C H A S M

 But note: we already know that the first letter is C and third is A, so we can focus on the other positions.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think of a word that uses common consonants and vowels that we haven't eliminated.

 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try ""CHAMP"": 
   C H A M P -> tests H, M, P.

 Or ""CLAMP"": but that has L and M, P. However, note that we don't know if L is in the word.

 But wait, in the first guess, we had 'R' absent, but we don't know about other letters.

 Since we have two positions to figure out (positions 2, 4, and 5) and we have three positions, we might want to cover more letters.

 Another idea: ""CHAFT"" is not a word. 

 How about ""CHAPS"": C H A P S -> tests H, P, S.

 But let's check if it's valid: CHAPS is a word (meaning the leather leggings).

 Alternatively, ""CHASM"" is a word.

 But note: we must avoid the letters R, N, E.

 Let me choose ""CHASM"" because it uses S and M, which are common.

 So, second guess: ""CHASM""

 We'll get feedback on:
   C: should be correct (position 1) -> we expect ✓
   H: we don't know -> could be ✓, -, or x
   A: should be correct (position 3) -> we expect ✓
   S: we don't know
   M: we don't know

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that the first letter is C and third is A, so in the second guess, we expect:
   Position 1: ✓ (C)
   Position 3: ✓ (A)

 The other positions (2,4,5) will give us new information.

 However, what if the word has an 'S'? We don't know. Similarly for M.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't reuse the known letters in the same positions? But we have to because we know C and A must be there.

 Actually, we must keep the known letters in their positions to get the word. But we can also try to move the known letters? 
 But wait: we know that C is in position 1 and A in position 3. So we must keep them.

 So, I'll go with ""CHASM"".

 But let me check if there are other words that might be better.

 Another word: ""CABAL"" -> but it has 'B' and 'L', and also the second letter is 'A'? No, because we have A in the third position. 
 Actually, ""CABAL"" is C A B A L -> but then the third letter is 'B', not 'A'. So that doesn't fit.

 How about ""CIVIC""? -> C I V I C -> third letter is 'V', not 'A'. So no.

 We need the third letter to be 'A'. So the pattern is C _ A _ _

 Words: 
   CHAFT? (not a word)
   CHAIN: but has 'N' -> eliminated because N is not allowed (from first feedback: N is absent)
   CHAIR: has 'R' -> eliminated (R is absent)
   CHAMP: C H A M P -> valid, and no R, N, E.

 So between CHAMP and CHASM, which one? 

 CHAMP: tests H, M, P.
 CHASM: tests H, S, M.

 We haven't tried S or P. Since S is a very common letter, maybe CHASM is better.

 But note: we also want to avoid using letters that might be in the word but we don't know. However, we have no information about them.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has a vowel in the second position? We know the word has an A in the third, but maybe it has another vowel? 

 How about ""COAST""? But wait, we have the third letter as A, so COAST would be C O A S T -> but we have to avoid 'E'? It doesn't have E, but it has O, S, T. 
 However, the first feedback said that E is absent, so we can use O, S, T.

 But note: the first feedback also said that the letter in position 2 of ""crane"" was R (which is absent) and we don't know about O. 

 However, ""COAST"" has the third letter as A, which is correct. But we must avoid R, N, E. ""COAST"" doesn't have any of these. 

 But wait, in the first guess, we had the letter 'A' in the third position and it was correct. So in ""COAST"", the third letter is A, so that's good.

 However, we already know that the first letter is C and third is A, so we can use any word that has C at the start and A at the third position, and avoids R, N, E.

 So ""COAST"" is a valid guess. It tests O, S, T.

 Now, which one gives more information? 

 We have to choose one. Let me list the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.
 Common vowels: O, I, etc.

 ""COAST"" uses O, S, T which are common. 
 ""CHASM"" uses H, S, M.

 Since we haven't tried O, S, T, and they are very common, ""COAST"" might be better.

 But note: we already know that the word has an A in the third position, so we don't need to test A again. 

 However, we are forced to have A in the third position.

 So, I think ""COAST"" is a good choice.

 But wait: what if the word is ""COAST"" itself? Then we win.

 However, we don't know. But we are on the second guess.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have the same letter repeated? All these words have distinct letters.

 Let me choose ""COAST"".

 So, second guess: ""COAST""

 We'll see the feedback.

 But note: the first guess had C and A in the correct positions, and we are keeping them. So:

   Position 1: C -> ✓
   Position 2: O -> ?
   Position 3: A -> ✓
   Position 4: S -> ?
   Position 5: T -> ?

 We'll get feedback on O, S, T.

 However, what if the word is ""CHAMP"", then we would have missed H, M, P? But we are trying to cover more common letters.

 Since S and T are more common than H and M, I think ""COAST"" is a good choice.

 But note: we must avoid the letters that we know are absent: R, N, E. ""COAST"" avoids these.

 So, I'll go with ""COAST"".

 However, let me check if ""COAST"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

 Therefore, the second guess is ""COAST"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓)
- R is absent (x)
- A is correct and in position 3 (✓)
- N is absent (x)
- E is absent (x)

The secret word must:
- Start with ""C""
- Have ""A"" as the third letter
- Exclude R, N, E entirely
- Be a valid 5-letter English word

For the second guess, I chose ""coast"" because:
- It preserves the known correct letters: ""C"" in position 1 and ""A"" in position 3
- It tests new common letters (O, S, T) in the unknown positions
