First, the feedback from my first guess ""CRANE"" is:
- C: x (not in the secret word)
- R: x (not in the secret word)
- A: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- N: x (not in the secret word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, A is correct and in position 3 (since positions are 1-based: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5). E is correct and in position 5.

I know that:
- The secret word has A in the third position.
- The secret word has E in the fifth position.
- C is not in the word.
- R is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.

Also, since positions matter, and these are marked as not in the word, they are absent.

Now, I need to make a second guess. My goal is to deduce more letters in the word.

The secret word has the form _ _ A _ E, since positions 3 and 5 are fixed as A and E.

Positions: Let's index them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)
- Position 1: not C
- Position 2: not R
- Position 4: not N

But R and C are not in the word at all, not just wrong position.

C(x) means C is not in the word.
R(x) means R is not in the word.
N(x) means N is not in the word.

A(✓) means A is in position 3.
E(✓) means E is in position 5.

Also, since feedback shows ""not in the word"", those letters are absent.

So the word has A in 3rd and E in 5th, and lacks C, R, N entirely.

Now, common English words with this pattern: _ _ A _ E

I need to guess a word that includes new letters to test.

Possible letters to try: since C, R, N are out, I should use other common consonants and vowels.

Vowels: A is already in place, E in place. But A and E are used. Other vowels could be in other positions.

Position 3 and 5 are fixed, so positions 1, 2, and 4 are variable.

Position 4 was not N, and N is absent.

I should avoid using C, R, N in my guess.

My second guess should have A in position 3 and E in position 5 to maintain that, but since they are fixed, I can include them to confirm, but I already know they are there, so I don't need to reuse them necessarily, but I can keep them to get information about other positions.

In Wordle strategy, it's often good to keep correct letters in place to narrow down the word.

But here, position 5 is E, fixed, so I should keep E there. Similarly, position 3 is A, fixed.

So my guess should have A in position 3 and E in position 5.

That leaves positions 1, 2, and 4 to guess.

For position 4, I know N is not there and not in the word, so I need to try a different letter.

Also, I need to introduce new letters to test.

I should choose a word that has A in 3, E in 5, and new letters in 1,2,4.

Avoiding C, R, N.

Common letters: S, T, L, etc.

Let me think of possible words ending with E and with A in the middle.

Pattern: _ _ A _ E

Examples:
- SHAKE
- STAKE
- PLAKE? Not a word.
- STAKE: S-T-A-K-E
- But K may be good.
- PHASE: P-H-A-S-E
- BLAME: B-L-A-M-E
- FLAME: F-L-A-M-E
- GRADE: G-R-A-D-E but R is absent, since R(x) from guess 1, so cannot use R.
R is not in the word, so Grade has R, which is invalid.

Since R is not in the word, I must not include R.

Similarly, C and N are not in the word.

In ""CRANE"", R was in position 2, and it's absent, so R is not in the word.

Therefore, in my guess, I should avoid C, R, N.

Possible words: let's list some.

- SHAKE: S in 1, H in 2, A in 3, K in 4, E in 5. S, H, K are new.
- STAKE: S-T-A-K-E. T is new.
- But STAKE has T, which could be ok.
- PLAKE not a word.
- SLATE: S-L-A-T-E but position 5 is T? No, SLATE is S-L-A-T-E, so position 5 is E? S-L-A-T-E, positions: 1=S,2=L,3=A,4=T,5=E. T in position 4.

But position 4 is T, which is new.

Another: FLAME: F-L-A-M-E.

M in position 4.

PHASE: P-H-A-S-E, S in position 4 and position 1? Positions: 1=P,2=H,3=A,4=S,5=E. S in both, but it's ok if S is there.

P H A S E.

Brave: B-R-A-V-E but R is absent, cannot use.

So avoid R.

So possible: SHAKE, STAKE, FLAME, PHASE, PLATE, but PLATE has L and T, but P-L-A-T-E, positions: 1=P,2=L,3=A,4=T,5=E.

All fine.

Now, I need to maximize information. SHAKE has S, H, K which are different.

But H might be less common.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.

A word with S and T could be good.

Try STAKE: S-T-A-K-E. But STAKE is a word.

S, T, A, K, E.

K is not that common.

FLAME: F-L-A-M-E. F, L, M.

PHASE: P-H-A-S-E. P, H, S.

Perhaps SLATE, but SLATE is S-L-A-T-E, and T in position 4.

SLATE is popular for Wordle.

But in SLATE, position 1=S,2=L,3=A,4=T,5=E.

And S, L, T are all common.

I could guess ""SLATE"".

But in my first guess, I used C,R,A,N,E. Now S,L,T are new.

SLATE seems fine.

Another option is ""PLATE"": P-L-A-T-E, similar.

Or ""TRACE"", but T-R-A-C-E, but C is absent, R is absent, and T is new? Positions:1=T,2=R,3=A,4=C,5=E. But R and C are absent, so I cannot use R or C.

So TRACE would be invalid because it contains R and C, which are not in the word? No, the word doesn't contain R and C, so if I guess TRACE, it would have incorrect letters.

But in the rules, the guess must be a valid English word, but it might contain letters that are absent, which is fine, but I'll get feedback that they are not in the secret word.

But since I know C and R are absent, I should avoid using them to save guesses and get information on other letters.

So better not to use C or R.

Similarly for N.

So avoid C,R,N.

For SLATE: S-L-A-T-E, no C,R,N used.

S, L, T are all possible.

L is a common letter.

Similarly, PLATE: P-L-A-T-E, also fine.

But I used P in CRANE? No, CRANE has C,R,A,N,E, no P.

Perhaps ""PHASE"" but H might be less common.

I think SLATE is a good choice.

But let me confirm the feedback rules.

After guessing SLATE, if secret word has S, L, T in positions or not.

But I don't know yet.

Since I need to find the word with A in 3 and E in 5, and C,R,N absent.

Let me think of possible English words with pattern _ _ A _ E.

Common ones: SHAKE, STAKE, SLATE, PLATE, GRAPE? G-R-A-P-E but R absent, cannot.

FLAME, GLADE? G-L-A-D-E, but D new.

BLAME, etc.

SHAME: S-H-A-M-E.

Many options.

To get more coverage, I could choose a word with common missing letters.

In my first guess, I used A,E,C,R,N.

C,R,N are out, so remaining common letters: S,T,L,I,O,U,B,D,G,F, etc.

In SLATE, I use S,L,T.

If I use ""POISE"", but no A and E fixed? I have to keep A and E in position 3 and 5? No, I don't have to, but if I don't, I might miss information.

If I guess a word without A in position 3 or E in position 5, but I know they are correct, so I should include them to ensure my guess follows the known correct positions, so that I can find incorrect positions elsewhere.

For example, if I guess a word with E not in position 5, but since E is in the word and position 5 is correct, it would show as wrong position if I put it elsewhere, which I already know it shouldn't be elsewhere.

But to keep things simple, I should keep the known correct letters in place.

So position 3 must be A, position 5 must be E.

So my guess should have A in position 3 and E in position 5.

Then only positions 1,2,4 need guessing.

Letters to avoid: C, R, N.

For position 4, it cannot be N, and since N is absent, I must use another consonant or vowel.

Position 4 is the fourth letter, which could be a consonant or vowel, like in SHAKE it's K, STAKE it's K, SLATE it's T, FLAME it's M, etc.

Now, to maximize information, I should choose a word with letters that are high frequency and can reveal more.

S, T, L are good choices.

Another word: ""SLATE"" is S-L-A-T-E.

Position 4 is T.

""PLATE"" is P-L-A-T-E.

""SLIME"" but SLIME is S-L-I-M-E, but position 3 should be A, not I.

So must be A in position 3.

So SLATE or PLATE are fine.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" for my second guess.

Then feedback will show for S, L, T.

S in position 1, L in position 2, T in position 4.

If S is present or not, L, etc.

Similarly for others.

So, guess ""SLATE"".

But in the feedback format, it's for each position.

I think it's a reasonable guess.

Since A and E are fixed, I need to guess the other letters.

Another common choice is ""SHADE"", but H and D.

""BLADE"" has L and D.

But perhaps SLATE is better.

I think I'll stick with SLATE.

So second guess: SLATE
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓), I know the following:
- The secret word has A in the third position and E in the fifth position, so the pattern is _ _ A _ E.
- C, R, and N are not in the secret word at all, so I must avoid these letters in my guess.

For my second guess, I should:
- Keep A in position 3 and E in position 5 to maintain the known correct positions.
- Focus on testing new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4 to gather more information.
- Avoid using C, R, or N, as they are confirmed absent.
- Use high-frequency English letters to maximize the chance of hitting present letters (e.g., S, T, L, D, P, M).

Considering possible words that fit this pattern, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice:
- It has S in position 1, L in position 2, A in position 3 (fixed), T in position 4, and E in position 5 (fixed).
- It introduces new letters: S, L, and T, which are common and can provide useful feedback on their presence/positions.
- Alternatives like ""SHAKE"" or ""PLATE"" were considered, but ""SLATE"" offers a good balance of common letters.

By guessing ""SLATE"", I can get feedback on S, L, and T:
- If S is in the word and/or correct position, it could reveal position 1.
- Similarly for L in position 2.
- For T in position 4, I can confirm if it fits or is present elsewhere.

This should help narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

<guess>slate</guess>",slate,"First, the feedback from my first guess ""CRANE"" is:
- C: x (not in the secret word)
- R: x (not in the secret word)
- A: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- N: x (not in the secret word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, A is correct and in position 3 (since positions are 1-based: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5). E is correct and in position 5.

I know that:
- The secret word has A in the third position.
- The secret word has E in the fifth position.
- C is not in the word.
- R is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.

Also, since positions matter, and these are marked as not in the word, they are absent.

Now, I need to make a second guess. My goal is to deduce more letters in the word.

The secret word has the form _ _ A _ E, since positions 3 and 5 are fixed as A and E.

Positions: Let's index them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)
- Position 1: not C
- Position 2: not R
- Position 4: not N

But R and C are not in the word at all, not just wrong position.

C(x) means C is not in the word.
R(x) means R is not in the word.
N(x) means N is not in the word.

A(✓) means A is in position 3.
E(✓) means E is in position 5.

Also, since feedback shows ""not in the word"", those letters are absent.

So the word has A in 3rd and E in 5th, and lacks C, R, N entirely.

Now, common English words with this pattern: _ _ A _ E

I need to guess a word that includes new letters to test.

Possible letters to try: since C, R, N are out, I should use other common consonants and vowels.

Vowels: A is already in place, E in place. But A and E are used. Other vowels could be in other positions.

Position 3 and 5 are fixed, so positions 1, 2, and 4 are variable.

Position 4 was not N, and N is absent.

I should avoid using C, R, N in my guess.

My second guess should have A in position 3 and E in position 5 to maintain that, but since they are fixed, I can include them to confirm, but I already know they are there, so I don't need to reuse them necessarily, but I can keep them to get information about other positions.

In Wordle strategy, it's often good to keep correct letters in place to narrow down the word.

But here, position 5 is E, fixed, so I should keep E there. Similarly, position 3 is A, fixed.

So my guess should have A in position 3 and E in position 5.

That leaves positions 1, 2, and 4 to guess.

For position 4, I know N is not there and not in the word, so I need to try a different letter.

Also, I need to introduce new letters to test.

I should choose a word that has A in 3, E in 5, and new letters in 1,2,4.

Avoiding C, R, N.

Common letters: S, T, L, etc.

Let me think of possible words ending with E and with A in the middle.

Pattern: _ _ A _ E

Examples:
- SHAKE
- STAKE
- PLAKE? Not a word.
- STAKE: S-T-A-K-E
- But K may be good.
- PHASE: P-H-A-S-E
- BLAME: B-L-A-M-E
- FLAME: F-L-A-M-E
- GRADE: G-R-A-D-E but R is absent, since R(x) from guess 1, so cannot use R.
R is not in the word, so Grade has R, which is invalid.

Since R is not in the word, I must not include R.

Similarly, C and N are not in the word.

In ""CRANE"", R was in position 2, and it's absent, so R is not in the word.

Therefore, in my guess, I should avoid C, R, N.

Possible words: let's list some.

- SHAKE: S in 1, H in 2, A in 3, K in 4, E in 5. S, H, K are new.
- STAKE: S-T-A-K-E. T is new.
- But STAKE has T, which could be ok.
- PLAKE not a word.
- SLATE: S-L-A-T-E but position 5 is T? No, SLATE is S-L-A-T-E, so position 5 is E? S-L-A-T-E, positions: 1=S,2=L,3=A,4=T,5=E. T in position 4.

But position 4 is T, which is new.

Another: FLAME: F-L-A-M-E.

M in position 4.

PHASE: P-H-A-S-E, S in position 4 and position 1? Positions: 1=P,2=H,3=A,4=S,5=E. S in both, but it's ok if S is there.

P H A S E.

Brave: B-R-A-V-E but R is absent, cannot use.

So avoid R.

So possible: SHAKE, STAKE, FLAME, PHASE, PLATE, but PLATE has L and T, but P-L-A-T-E, positions: 1=P,2=L,3=A,4=T,5=E.

All fine.

Now, I need to maximize information. SHAKE has S, H, K which are different.

But H might be less common.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.

A word with S and T could be good.

Try STAKE: S-T-A-K-E. But STAKE is a word.

S, T, A, K, E.

K is not that common.

FLAME: F-L-A-M-E. F, L, M.

PHASE: P-H-A-S-E. P, H, S.

Perhaps SLATE, but SLATE is S-L-A-T-E, and T in position 4.

SLATE is popular for Wordle.

But in SLATE, position 1=S,2=L,3=A,4=T,5=E.

And S, L, T are all common.

I could guess ""SLATE"".

But in my first guess, I used C,R,A,N,E. Now S,L,T are new.

SLATE seems fine.

Another option is ""PLATE"": P-L-A-T-E, similar.

Or ""TRACE"", but T-R-A-C-E, but C is absent, R is absent, and T is new? Positions:1=T,2=R,3=A,4=C,5=E. But R and C are absent, so I cannot use R or C.

So TRACE would be invalid because it contains R and C, which are not in the word? No, the word doesn't contain R and C, so if I guess TRACE, it would have incorrect letters.

But in the rules, the guess must be a valid English word, but it might contain letters that are absent, which is fine, but I'll get feedback that they are not in the secret word.

But since I know C and R are absent, I should avoid using them to save guesses and get information on other letters.

So better not to use C or R.

Similarly for N.

So avoid C,R,N.

For SLATE: S-L-A-T-E, no C,R,N used.

S, L, T are all possible.

L is a common letter.

Similarly, PLATE: P-L-A-T-E, also fine.

But I used P in CRANE? No, CRANE has C,R,A,N,E, no P.

Perhaps ""PHASE"" but H might be less common.

I think SLATE is a good choice.

But let me confirm the feedback rules.

After guessing SLATE, if secret word has S, L, T in positions or not.

But I don't know yet.

Since I need to find the word with A in 3 and E in 5, and C,R,N absent.

Let me think of possible English words with pattern _ _ A _ E.

Common ones: SHAKE, STAKE, SLATE, PLATE, GRAPE? G-R-A-P-E but R absent, cannot.

FLAME, GLADE? G-L-A-D-E, but D new.

BLAME, etc.

SHAME: S-H-A-M-E.

Many options.

To get more coverage, I could choose a word with common missing letters.

In my first guess, I used A,E,C,R,N.

C,R,N are out, so remaining common letters: S,T,L,I,O,U,B,D,G,F, etc.

In SLATE, I use S,L,T.

If I use ""POISE"", but no A and E fixed? I have to keep A and E in position 3 and 5? No, I don't have to, but if I don't, I might miss information.

If I guess a word without A in position 3 or E in position 5, but I know they are correct, so I should include them to ensure my guess follows the known correct positions, so that I can find incorrect positions elsewhere.

For example, if I guess a word with E not in position 5, but since E is in the word and position 5 is correct, it would show as wrong position if I put it elsewhere, which I already know it shouldn't be elsewhere.

But to keep things simple, I should keep the known correct letters in place.

So position 3 must be A, position 5 must be E.

So my guess should have A in position 3 and E in position 5.

Then only positions 1,2,4 need guessing.

Letters to avoid: C, R, N.

For position 4, it cannot be N, and since N is absent, I must use another consonant or vowel.

Position 4 is the fourth letter, which could be a consonant or vowel, like in SHAKE it's K, STAKE it's K, SLATE it's T, FLAME it's M, etc.

Now, to maximize information, I should choose a word with letters that are high frequency and can reveal more.

S, T, L are good choices.

Another word: ""SLATE"" is S-L-A-T-E.

Position 4 is T.

""PLATE"" is P-L-A-T-E.

""SLIME"" but SLIME is S-L-I-M-E, but position 3 should be A, not I.

So must be A in position 3.

So SLATE or PLATE are fine.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" for my second guess.

Then feedback will show for S, L, T.

S in position 1, L in position 2, T in position 4.

If S is present or not, L, etc.

Similarly for others.

So, guess ""SLATE"".

But in the feedback format, it's for each position.

I think it's a reasonable guess.

Since A and E are fixed, I need to guess the other letters.

Another common choice is ""SHADE"", but H and D.

""BLADE"" has L and D.

But perhaps SLATE is better.

I think I'll stick with SLATE.

So second guess: SLATEBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓), I know the following:
- The secret word has A in the third position and E in the fifth position, so the pattern is _ _ A _ E.
- C, R, and N are not in the secret word at all, so I must avoid these letters in my guess.

For my second guess, I should:
- Keep A in position 3 and E in position 5 to maintain the known correct positions.
- Focus on testing new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4 to gather more information.
- Avoid using C, R, or N, as they are confirmed absent.
- Use high-frequency English letters to maximize the chance of hitting present letters (e.g., S, T, L, D, P, M).

Considering possible words that fit this pattern, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice:
- It has S in position 1, L in position 2, A in position 3 (fixed), T in position 4, and E in position 5 (fixed).
- It introduces new letters: S, L, and T, which are common and can provide useful feedback on their presence/positions.
- Alternatives like ""SHAKE"" or ""PLATE"" were considered, but ""SLATE"" offers a good balance of common letters.

By guessing ""SLATE"", I can get feedback on S, L, and T:
- If S is in the word and/or correct position, it could reveal position 1.
- Similarly for L in position 2.
- For T in position 4, I can confirm if it fits or is present elsewhere.

This should help narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.",Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,shame,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the feedback from my first guess ""CRANE"" is:
- C: x (not in the secret word)
- R: x (not in the secret word)
- A: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- N: x (not in the secret word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, A is correct and in position 3 (since positions are 1-based: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5). E is correct and in position 5.

I know that:
- The secret word has A in the third position.
- The secret word has E in the fifth position.
- C is not in the word.
- R is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.

Also, since positions matter, and these are marked as not in the word, they are absent.

Now, I need to make a second guess. My goal is to deduce more letters in the word.

The secret word has the form _ _ A _ E, since positions 3 and 5 are fixed as A and E.

Positions: Let's index them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)
- Position 1: not C
- Position 2: not R
- Position 4: not N

But R and C are not in the word at all, not just wrong position.

C(x) means C is not in the word.
R(x) means R is not in the word.
N(x) means N is not in the word.

A(✓) means A is in position 3.
E(✓) means E is in position 5.

Also, since feedback shows ""not in the word"", those letters are absent.

So the word has A in 3rd and E in 5th, and lacks C, R, N entirely.

Now, common English words with this pattern: _ _ A _ E

I need to guess a word that includes new letters to test.

Possible letters to try: since C, R, N are out, I should use other common consonants and vowels.

Vowels: A is already in place, E in place. But A and E are used. Other vowels could be in other positions.

Position 3 and 5 are fixed, so positions 1, 2, and 4 are variable.

Position 4 was not N, and N is absent.

I should avoid using C, R, N in my guess.

My second guess should have A in position 3 and E in position 5 to maintain that, but since they are fixed, I can include them to confirm, but I already know they are there, so I don't need to reuse them necessarily, but I can keep them to get information about other positions.

In Wordle strategy, it's often good to keep correct letters in place to narrow down the word.

But here, position 5 is E, fixed, so I should keep E there. Similarly, position 3 is A, fixed.

So my guess should have A in position 3 and E in position 5.

That leaves positions 1, 2, and 4 to guess.

For position 4, I know N is not there and not in the word, so I need to try a different letter.

Also, I need to introduce new letters to test.

I should choose a word that has A in 3, E in 5, and new letters in 1,2,4.

Avoiding C, R, N.

Common letters: S, T, L, etc.

Let me think of possible words ending with E and with A in the middle.

Pattern: _ _ A _ E

Examples:
- SHAKE
- STAKE
- PLAKE? Not a word.
- STAKE: S-T-A-K-E
- But K may be good.
- PHASE: P-H-A-S-E
- BLAME: B-L-A-M-E
- FLAME: F-L-A-M-E
- GRADE: G-R-A-D-E but R is absent, since R(x) from guess 1, so cannot use R.
R is not in the word, so Grade has R, which is invalid.

Since R is not in the word, I must not include R.

Similarly, C and N are not in the word.

In ""CRANE"", R was in position 2, and it's absent, so R is not in the word.

Therefore, in my guess, I should avoid C, R, N.

Possible words: let's list some.

- SHAKE: S in 1, H in 2, A in 3, K in 4, E in 5. S, H, K are new.
- STAKE: S-T-A-K-E. T is new.
- But STAKE has T, which could be ok.
- PLAKE not a word.
- SLATE: S-L-A-T-E but position 5 is T? No, SLATE is S-L-A-T-E, so position 5 is E? S-L-A-T-E, positions: 1=S,2=L,3=A,4=T,5=E. T in position 4.

But position 4 is T, which is new.

Another: FLAME: F-L-A-M-E.

M in position 4.

PHASE: P-H-A-S-E, S in position 4 and position 1? Positions: 1=P,2=H,3=A,4=S,5=E. S in both, but it's ok if S is there.

P H A S E.

Brave: B-R-A-V-E but R is absent, cannot use.

So avoid R.

So possible: SHAKE, STAKE, FLAME, PHASE, PLATE, but PLATE has L and T, but P-L-A-T-E, positions: 1=P,2=L,3=A,4=T,5=E.

All fine.

Now, I need to maximize information. SHAKE has S, H, K which are different.

But H might be less common.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.

A word with S and T could be good.

Try STAKE: S-T-A-K-E. But STAKE is a word.

S, T, A, K, E.

K is not that common.

FLAME: F-L-A-M-E. F, L, M.

PHASE: P-H-A-S-E. P, H, S.

Perhaps SLATE, but SLATE is S-L-A-T-E, and T in position 4.

SLATE is popular for Wordle.

But in SLATE, position 1=S,2=L,3=A,4=T,5=E.

And S, L, T are all common.

I could guess ""SLATE"".

But in my first guess, I used C,R,A,N,E. Now S,L,T are new.

SLATE seems fine.

Another option is ""PLATE"": P-L-A-T-E, similar.

Or ""TRACE"", but T-R-A-C-E, but C is absent, R is absent, and T is new? Positions:1=T,2=R,3=A,4=C,5=E. But R and C are absent, so I cannot use R or C.

So TRACE would be invalid because it contains R and C, which are not in the word? No, the word doesn't contain R and C, so if I guess TRACE, it would have incorrect letters.

But in the rules, the guess must be a valid English word, but it might contain letters that are absent, which is fine, but I'll get feedback that they are not in the secret word.

But since I know C and R are absent, I should avoid using them to save guesses and get information on other letters.

So better not to use C or R.

Similarly for N.

So avoid C,R,N.

For SLATE: S-L-A-T-E, no C,R,N used.

S, L, T are all possible.

L is a common letter.

Similarly, PLATE: P-L-A-T-E, also fine.

But I used P in CRANE? No, CRANE has C,R,A,N,E, no P.

Perhaps ""PHASE"" but H might be less common.

I think SLATE is a good choice.

But let me confirm the feedback rules.

After guessing SLATE, if secret word has S, L, T in positions or not.

But I don't know yet.

Since I need to find the word with A in 3 and E in 5, and C,R,N absent.

Let me think of possible English words with pattern _ _ A _ E.

Common ones: SHAKE, STAKE, SLATE, PLATE, GRAPE? G-R-A-P-E but R absent, cannot.

FLAME, GLADE? G-L-A-D-E, but D new.

BLAME, etc.

SHAME: S-H-A-M-E.

Many options.

To get more coverage, I could choose a word with common missing letters.

In my first guess, I used A,E,C,R,N.

C,R,N are out, so remaining common letters: S,T,L,I,O,U,B,D,G,F, etc.

In SLATE, I use S,L,T.

If I use ""POISE"", but no A and E fixed? I have to keep A and E in position 3 and 5? No, I don't have to, but if I don't, I might miss information.

If I guess a word without A in position 3 or E in position 5, but I know they are correct, so I should include them to ensure my guess follows the known correct positions, so that I can find incorrect positions elsewhere.

For example, if I guess a word with E not in position 5, but since E is in the word and position 5 is correct, it would show as wrong position if I put it elsewhere, which I already know it shouldn't be elsewhere.

But to keep things simple, I should keep the known correct letters in place.

So position 3 must be A, position 5 must be E.

So my guess should have A in position 3 and E in position 5.

Then only positions 1,2,4 need guessing.

Letters to avoid: C, R, N.

For position 4, it cannot be N, and since N is absent, I must use another consonant or vowel.

Position 4 is the fourth letter, which could be a consonant or vowel, like in SHAKE it's K, STAKE it's K, SLATE it's T, FLAME it's M, etc.

Now, to maximize information, I should choose a word with letters that are high frequency and can reveal more.

S, T, L are good choices.

Another word: ""SLATE"" is S-L-A-T-E.

Position 4 is T.

""PLATE"" is P-L-A-T-E.

""SLIME"" but SLIME is S-L-I-M-E, but position 3 should be A, not I.

So must be A in position 3.

So SLATE or PLATE are fine.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" for my second guess.

Then feedback will show for S, L, T.

S in position 1, L in position 2, T in position 4.

If S is present or not, L, etc.

Similarly for others.

So, guess ""SLATE"".

But in the feedback format, it's for each position.

I think it's a reasonable guess.

Since A and E are fixed, I need to guess the other letters.

Another common choice is ""SHADE"", but H and D.

""BLADE"" has L and D.

But perhaps SLATE is better.

I think I'll stick with SLATE.

So second guess: SLATEBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓), I know the following:
- The secret word has A in the third position and E in the fifth position, so the pattern is _ _ A _ E.
- C, R, and N are not in the secret word at all, so I must avoid these letters in my guess.

For my second guess, I should:
- Keep A in position 3 and E in position 5 to maintain the known correct positions.
- Focus on testing new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4 to gather more information.
- Avoid using C, R, or N, as they are confirmed absent.
- Use high-frequency English letters to maximize the chance of hitting present letters (e.g., S, T, L, D, P, M).

Considering possible words that fit this pattern, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice:
- It has S in position 1, L in position 2, A in position 3 (fixed), T in position 4, and E in position 5 (fixed).
- It introduces new letters: S, L, and T, which are common and can provide useful feedback on their presence/positions.
- Alternatives like ""SHAKE"" or ""PLATE"" were considered, but ""SLATE"" offers a good balance of common letters.

By guessing ""SLATE"", I can get feedback on S, L, and T:
- If S is in the word and/or correct position, it could reveal position 1.
- Similarly for L in position 2.
- For T in position 4, I can confirm if it fits or is present elsewhere.

This should help narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)

So, we know:
- The word has A in position 3 and E in position 5: _ _ A _ E
- C, R, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: SLATE
- S: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, position 3)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)

So, from this:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1). So the word starts with S: S _ A _ E
- L is not in the word at all. So we add L to the absent letters.
- T is not in the word at all. So we add T to the absent letters.

Now, we know:
- The word is S _ A _ E
- Absent letters: C, R, N, L, T
- Present and correctly placed: S (pos1), A (pos3), E (pos5)

We need to find the second and fourth letters.

The second position (position 2) and fourth position (position 4) are unknown.

We have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, L, T.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we need to fill in positions 2 and 4 with letters that are not in the absent list.

Common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (but we have to form a valid English word).

The pattern is: S _ A _ E

Possible words:
- We need to consider what letters can go in position 2 and position 4.

Since we have only two positions to guess, and we have 6 tries, we can make a guess that uses common letters to test.

But note: we don't know if the letters in position 2 and 4 are vowels or consonants. Position 2 could be a vowel (like in ""SHADE"") or a consonant (like in ""SPACE"", but C is absent, so not).

Let's list possible words that fit S _ A _ E and avoid C,R,N,L,T.

Some possibilities:
- SHADE: S H A D E -> H in pos2, D in pos4
- SHAME: S H A M E -> H in pos2, M in pos4
- SHAVE: S H A V E -> H in pos2, V in pos4
- SHAPE: S H A P E -> H in pos2, P in pos4
- SKATE: but K is possible? S K A T E -> but T is absent, so not allowed (T is absent, so we can't use T)
- SPADE: S P A D E -> P in pos2, D in pos4
- STAGE: but T is absent, so no.
- SOARE? Not common, and O in pos2, R is absent? R is absent, so if we use R, it's invalid. But SOARE might not be accepted.

We need valid English words.

Common words: SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE, etc.

We also have to consider that position 4 must be a letter that can form a word.

Now, from the feedback, we know that L and T are absent, so we can eliminate any word containing L or T.

In our next guess, we should try to cover multiple possibilities.

We have two positions to guess: 2 and 4.

We can choose a word that uses common letters for these positions.

For example, let's use H for position 2 and D for position 4: SHADE.

But if we do that, we only test one possibility.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has a different letter in position 2 to test more.

But we have to keep S, A, E fixed.

So the guess must be S in pos1, A in pos3, E in pos5.

We can only vary pos2 and pos4.

To maximize information, we should choose letters that are common and not yet tested.

So far, we have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T.

A and E are known and fixed, S is fixed.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

For position 2, common letters: H, P, M, D, etc.

For position 4, common letters: D, M, P, V, etc.

We can guess ""SHADE"" to test H and D.

If H is in the word and in position, or D in position, we get feedback.

Similarly, ""SHAME"" tests H and M.

But we can only guess one.

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that might be the answer or cover frequent letters.

Another idea: use a word that has a vowel in position 2 to see if there is another vowel, but we already have A and E, so it might be consonant-heavy.

List of possible words fitting S _ A _ E without C,R,N,L,T:

- SHADE (H,D)
- SHAME (H,M)
- SHAVE (H,V)
- SHAPE (H,P) - but P is a consonant
- SPADE (P,D) - P in pos2, D in pos4
- SKATE is invalid because of T
- SMITE? But I in pos2, M in pos4, but SMITE is S-M-I-T-E, but position 3 is I? No, we need A in position 3. SMITE has M in position 2? S-M-I-T-E, so position 2 is M, position 3 is I, but we need position 3 to be A, so not.

The word must have A in position 3, so it must be S ? A ? E.

So only position 2 and 4 vary.

Other words: 
- STALE? But T and L are absent, so no.
- SCALE? C and L absent, no.
- So, back to: SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE, etc.

Also, ""SPARE"" but R is absent, so no.

""SNARE"" has N and R, both absent.

""SWEAT"" but position 5 is T, not E, and T absent.

No, must end with E.

""SOAPY"" not ending with E.

So, common ones: SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE.

Also, ""STAGE"" has T, absent.

""SUAVE"": S U A V E -> U in pos2, V in pos4. That's possible.

""SUAVE"" is a word.

Similarly, ""SPACE"" has C, absent.

So possible words: SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE, SUAVE.

Now, we need to choose one for the next guess.

We can pick ""SHADE"" to test H and D.

But if we guess SHADE and it's wrong, we might not get much information about other letters.

Since we have multiple options, we can choose a word that uses letters that are in many possibilities.

For example, H appears in SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE.

D appears in SHADE, SPADE.

M appears in SHAME.

V in SHAVE.

P in SHAPE and SPADE.

U in SUAVE.

If I guess ""SHAPE"", for example, I test H and P.

If H is correct in position 2, and P in position 4, then it's SHAPE.

If H is correct but P is wrong, then P might be absent or wrong position, but position 4 is the only unknown, so if P is not in position 4, it might be absent or in another position, but the only positions are 2 and 4, and position 2 is H? In SHAPE, position 2 is H, position 4 is P.

If after guess, H is marked correct, then position 2 is H, and if P is marked correct, then position 4 is P.

If P is absent, then we know P is not in the word, and position 4 is something else.

Similarly for H.

But H is only in position 2 in these words, so if H is absent, then we know position 2 is not H, and H is not in the word.

Similarly for P.

But let's see the feedback possibilities.

To cover more ground, I could choose a word with a letter that is in multiple options, like H.

But I think for the third guess, since we have only two positions, we can make a direct guess.

We have 4 guesses left (since 2 used, total 6).

But let's be efficient.

Another idea: use a word that has a letter that can be in position 4, but we put it in position 2 to test, but we have to keep the fixed letters.

We cannot change S, A, E.

So only positions 2 and 4 are free.

I think I'll go with ""SHADE"" as a common word.

Then, if it's not, we get feedback on H and D.

But let's see.

Perhaps ""SPADE"" to test P and D.

But I think SHADE is fine.

Since S is fixed, and we have A and E, the word is likely to have a consonant in position 2 and a consonant in position 4, or sometimes a vowel.

For example, SUAVE has U (vowel) in position 2.

But U is less common.

I think I'll guess ""SHADE"".

So, guess: SHADE

But let's confirm the format.

In the feedback, for SHADE, we will get:

Position 1: S - should be correct (since we know it is)

Position 2: H - we'll see if it's present and correct

Position 3: A - correct

Position 4: D - present and position?

Position 5: E - correct

But we need to see the feedback.

If H is correct, then position 2 is H, and if D is correct, then it's SHADE.

If not, we know more.

But there are other possibilities like SHAME, etc.

To save a guess, we could guess a word that has multiple possibilities, but with only two positions, it's hard.

I think it's acceptable.

Another common word: ""SHINE"" but position 3 is I, not A, so no.

Must have A in position 3.

So, I'll go with ""SHADE"".

But let's list the possible words again to be sure:

- SHADE: S H A D E
- SHAME: S H A M E
- SHAVE: S H A V E
- SHAPE: S H A P E
- SPADE: S P A D E
- SUAVE: S U A V E

Also, ""STAVE"" has T, absent.

""SCALE"" has C and L, absent.

So about 6 possibilities.

If I guess ""SHADE"", and it's not correct, then:

- If H is correct, then position 2 is H, and D must be wrong (since word is not SHADE), so D is either absent or in wrong position. But position 4 is the only place, so if D is present but not in position 4, it must be in another position, but positions 1,3,5 are fixed, so D can only be in position 2 or 4. But position 2 is H (if correct), so D cannot be there, so if D is present, it must be in position 4, but if it's not correct, then D is absent. Similarly, if H is absent, then position 2 is not H, and H is not in the word.

Similarly for other cases.

But it might be messy.

To test more letters, I could guess a word that has a letter not in the possible set, but that might not be efficient.

For example, guess ""SUMPT"" but not a word, and we have to have A and E.

I think I should stick with a real possibility.

Perhaps ""SHAPE"" to test H and P.

If H is correct and P is correct, it's SHAPE.

If H correct, P absent, then position 4 is not P, and P absent, so the word could be SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE (if H is present).

But if H is correct, then position 2 is H, so the word is S H A ? E, and ? in position 4 must be D, M, V, or P (if not absent).

Similarly.

I think for simplicity, I'll guess ""SHADE"".

But let's see the feedback from the assistant.

The user said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" with previous feedback.

I need to output the guess.

I think ""SHADE"" is a reasonable choice.

So, <guess>shade</guess>

But to be more strategic, since we have SUAVE, which has U, a vowel, we might want to test if there is a vowel in position 2.

But I think SHADE is fine.

I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
  This reveals:
  - A is in the correct position (position 3).
  - E is in the correct position (position 5).
  - C, R, and N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: SLATE** → Feedback: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)  
  This reveals:
  - S is in the correct position (position 1).
  - A and E remain correct in positions 3 and 5.
  - L and T are not in the word.

### Current Knowledge:
- The secret word has the pattern: **S _ A _ E** (positions: 1=S, 3=A, 5=E).
- Confirmed absent letters: **C, R, N, L, T** (must avoid these).
- Positions to solve: **2 and 4**.
- Possible letters for positions 2 and 4: Any English letter except C, R, N, L, T. Common options include B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Since only positions 2 and 4 are unknown, the next guess should test high-frequency letters for these positions to narrow down possibilities.
- Keep S, A, and E fixed in positions 1, 3, and 5 to maintain known correct positions.
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, L, T).
- Common words fitting the pattern **S _ A _ E** include SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE, and SUAVE.
- I choose **SHADE** for the third guess because:
  - It tests **H** (position 2) and **D** (position 4), both common letters not yet tried.
  - If H is correct, it could confirm position 2; if D is correct, it could confirm position 4.
  - Feedback will quickly eliminate possibilities (e.g., if H is absent, words like SHAME or SHAVE are ruled out; if D is absent, SPADE is ruled out).

<guess>shade</guess>",shade,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)

So, we know:
- The word has A in position 3 and E in position 5: _ _ A _ E
- C, R, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: SLATE
- S: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, position 3)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)

So, from this:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1). So the word starts with S: S _ A _ E
- L is not in the word at all. So we add L to the absent letters.
- T is not in the word at all. So we add T to the absent letters.

Now, we know:
- The word is S _ A _ E
- Absent letters: C, R, N, L, T
- Present and correctly placed: S (pos1), A (pos3), E (pos5)

We need to find the second and fourth letters.

The second position (position 2) and fourth position (position 4) are unknown.

We have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, L, T.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we need to fill in positions 2 and 4 with letters that are not in the absent list.

Common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (but we have to form a valid English word).

The pattern is: S _ A _ E

Possible words:
- We need to consider what letters can go in position 2 and position 4.

Since we have only two positions to guess, and we have 6 tries, we can make a guess that uses common letters to test.

But note: we don't know if the letters in position 2 and 4 are vowels or consonants. Position 2 could be a vowel (like in ""SHADE"") or a consonant (like in ""SPACE"", but C is absent, so not).

Let's list possible words that fit S _ A _ E and avoid C,R,N,L,T.

Some possibilities:

- SHAME: S H A M E -> H in pos2, M in pos4
- SHAVE: S H A V E -> H in pos2, V in pos4
- SHAPE: S H A P E -> H in pos2, P in pos4
- SKATE: but K is possible? S K A T E -> but T is absent, so not allowed (T is absent, so we can't use T)
- SPADE: S P A D E -> P in pos2, D in pos4
- STAGE: but T is absent, so no.
- SOARE? Not common, and O in pos2, R is absent? R is absent, so if we use R, it's invalid. But SOARE might not be accepted.

We need valid English words.

Common words: SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE, etc.

We also have to consider that position 4 must be a letter that can form a word.

Now, from the feedback, we know that L and T are absent, so we can eliminate any word containing L or T.

To maximize information, we should choose letters that are common and not yet tested.

A and E are known and fixed, S is fixed.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

For position 2, common letters: H, P, M, D, etc.

For position 4, common letters: D, M, P, V, etc.

We can guess ""SHADE"" to test H and D.

If H is in the word and in position, or D in position, we get feedback.

Similarly, ""SHAME"" tests H and M.

- SMITE? But I in pos2, M in pos4, but SMITE is S-M-I-T-E, but position 3 is I? No, we need A in position 3. SMITE has M in position 2? S-M-I-T-E, so position 2 is M, position 3 is I, but we need position 3 to be A, so not.

The word must have A in position 3, so it must be S ? A ? E.

So only position 2 and 4 vary.

Other words: 
- STALE? But T and L are absent, so no.
- SCALE? C and L absent, no.
- So, back to: SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE, etc.

Also, ""SPARE"" but R is absent, so no.

""SNARE"" has N and R, both absent.

""SWEAT"" but position 5 is T, not E, and T absent.

No, must end with E.

""SOAPY"" not ending with E.

So, common ones: SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE.

Also, ""STAGE"" has T, absent.

""SUAVE"": S U A V E -> U in pos2, V in pos4. That's possible.

""SUAVE"" is a word.

Similarly, ""SPACE"" has C, absent.

So possible words: SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE, SUAVE.

Now, we need to choose one for the next guess.

We can pick ""SHADE"" to test H and D.

But if we guess SHADE and it's wrong, we might not get much information about other letters.

Since we have multiple options, we can choose a word that uses letters that are in many possibilities.

For example, H appears in SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE.

D appears in SHADE, SPADE.

M appears in SHAME.

V in SHAVE.

P in SHAPE and SPADE.

U in SUAVE.

If I guess ""SHAPE"", for example, I test H and P.

If H is correct in position 2, and P in position 4, then it's SHAPE.

If H is correct but P is wrong, then P might be absent or wrong position, but position 4 is the only unknown, so if P is not in position 4, it might be absent or in another position, but the only positions are 2 and 4, and position 2 is H? In SHAPE, position 2 is H, position 4 is P.

If after guess, H is marked correct, then position 2 is H, and if P is marked correct, then position 4 is P.

If P is absent, then we know P is not in the word, and position 4 is something else.

Similarly for H.

But H is only in position 2 in these words, so if H is absent, then we know position 2 is not H, and H is not in the word.

Similarly for P.

Another idea: use a word that has a letter that can be in position 4, but we put it in position 2 to test, but we have to keep the fixed letters.

We cannot change S, A, E.

So only positions 2 and 4 are free.

I think I'll go with ""SHADE"" as a common word.

Then, if it's not, we get feedback on H and D.

But let's see.

Perhaps ""SPADE"" to test P and D.

But I think SHADE is fine.

Since S is fixed, and we have A and E, the word is likely to have a consonant in position 2 and a consonant in position 4, or sometimes a vowel.

For example, SUAVE has U (vowel) in position 2.

But U is less common.

But let's confirm the format.

In the feedback, for SHADE, we will get:

Position 1: S - should be correct (since we know it is)

- SHAME: S H A M E
- SHAVE: S H A V E
- SHAPE: S H A P E
- SPADE: S P A D E
- SUAVE: S U A V E

Also, ""STAVE"" has T, absent.

""SCALE"" has C and L, absent.

So about 6 possibilities.

If I guess ""SHADE"", and it's not correct, then:

- If H is correct, then position 2 is H, and D must be wrong (since word is not SHADE), so D is either absent or in wrong position. But position 4 is the only place, so if D is present but not in position 4, it must be in another position, but positions 1,3,5 are fixed, so D can only be in position 2 or 4. But position 2 is H (if correct), so D cannot be there, so if D is present, it must be in position 4, but if it's not correct, then D is absent. Similarly, if H is absent, then position 2 is not H, and H is not in the word.

Similarly for other cases.

But it might be messy.

To test more letters, I could guess a word that has a letter not in the possible set, but that might not be efficient.

For example, guess ""SUMPT"" but not a word, and we have to have A and E.

I think I should stick with a real possibility.

Perhaps ""SHAPE"" to test H and P.

If H is correct and P is correct, it's SHAPE.

If H correct, P absent, then position 4 is not P, and P absent, so the word could be SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE (if H is present).

But if H is correct, then position 2 is H, so the word is S H A ? E, and ? in position 4 must be D, M, V, or P (if not absent).

Similarly.

I think for simplicity, I'll guess ""SHADE"".

But let's see the feedback from the assistant.

The user said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" with previous feedback.

I need to output the guess.

I think ""SHADE"" is a reasonable choice.

So, <guess>shade</guess>

But to be more strategic, since we have SUAVE, which has U, a vowel, we might want to test if there is a vowel in position 2.

But I think SHADE is fine.

I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
  This reveals:
  - A is in the correct position (position 3).
  - E is in the correct position (position 5).
  - C, R, and N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: SLATE** → Feedback: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)  
  This reveals:
  - S is in the correct position (position 1).
  - A and E remain correct in positions 3 and 5.
  - L and T are not in the word.

### Current Knowledge:
- The secret word has the pattern: **S _ A _ E** (positions: 1=S, 3=A, 5=E).
- Confirmed absent letters: **C, R, N, L, T** (must avoid these).
- Positions to solve: **2 and 4**.
- Possible letters for positions 2 and 4: Any English letter except C, R, N, L, T. Common options include B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Since only positions 2 and 4 are unknown, the next guess should test high-frequency letters for these positions to narrow down possibilities.
- Keep S, A, and E fixed in positions 1, 3, and 5 to maintain known correct positions.
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, L, T).
- Common words fitting the pattern **S _ A _ E** include SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE, and SUAVE.
- I choose **SHADE** for the third guess because:
  - It tests **H** (position 2) and **D** (position 4), both common letters not yet tried.
  - If H is correct, it could confirm position 2; if D is correct, it could confirm position 4.
  - Feedback will quickly eliminate possibilities (e.g., if H is absent, words like SHAME or SHAVE are ruled out; if D is absent, SPADE is ruled out).",Guess 3: shade -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,shame,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>First, the feedback from my first guess ""CRANE"" is:
- C: x (not in the secret word)
- R: x (not in the secret word)
- A: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- N: x (not in the secret word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, A is correct and in position 3 (since positions are 1-based: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5). E is correct and in position 5.

I know that:
- The secret word has A in the third position.
- The secret word has E in the fifth position.
- C is not in the word.
- R is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.

Also, since positions matter, and these are marked as not in the word, they are absent.

Now, I need to make a second guess. My goal is to deduce more letters in the word.

The secret word has the form _ _ A _ E, since positions 3 and 5 are fixed as A and E.

Positions: Let's index them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)
- Position 1: not C
- Position 2: not R
- Position 4: not N

But R and C are not in the word at all, not just wrong position.

C(x) means C is not in the word.
R(x) means R is not in the word.
N(x) means N is not in the word.

A(✓) means A is in position 3.
E(✓) means E is in position 5.

Also, since feedback shows ""not in the word"", those letters are absent.

So the word has A in 3rd and E in 5th, and lacks C, R, N entirely.

Now, common English words with this pattern: _ _ A _ E

I need to guess a word that includes new letters to test.

Possible letters to try: since C, R, N are out, I should use other common consonants and vowels.

Vowels: A is already in place, E in place. But A and E are used. Other vowels could be in other positions.

Position 3 and 5 are fixed, so positions 1, 2, and 4 are variable.

Position 4 was not N, and N is absent.

I should avoid using C, R, N in my guess.

My second guess should have A in position 3 and E in position 5 to maintain that, but since they are fixed, I can include them to confirm, but I already know they are there, so I don't need to reuse them necessarily, but I can keep them to get information about other positions.

In Wordle strategy, it's often good to keep correct letters in place to narrow down the word.

But here, position 5 is E, fixed, so I should keep E there. Similarly, position 3 is A, fixed.

So my guess should have A in position 3 and E in position 5.

That leaves positions 1, 2, and 4 to guess.

For position 4, I know N is not there and not in the word, so I need to try a different letter.

Also, I need to introduce new letters to test.

I should choose a word that has A in 3, E in 5, and new letters in 1,2,4.

Avoiding C, R, N.

Common letters: S, T, L, etc.

Let me think of possible words ending with E and with A in the middle.

Pattern: _ _ A _ E

Examples:
- SHAKE
- STAKE
- PLAKE? Not a word.
- STAKE: S-T-A-K-E
- But K may be good.
- PHASE: P-H-A-S-E
- BLAME: B-L-A-M-E
- FLAME: F-L-A-M-E
- GRADE: G-R-A-D-E but R is absent, since R(x) from guess 1, so cannot use R.
R is not in the word, so Grade has R, which is invalid.

Since R is not in the word, I must not include R.

Similarly, C and N are not in the word.

In ""CRANE"", R was in position 2, and it's absent, so R is not in the word.

Therefore, in my guess, I should avoid C, R, N.

Possible words: let's list some.

- SHAKE: S in 1, H in 2, A in 3, K in 4, E in 5. S, H, K are new.
- STAKE: S-T-A-K-E. T is new.
- But STAKE has T, which could be ok.
- PLAKE not a word.
- SLATE: S-L-A-T-E but position 5 is T? No, SLATE is S-L-A-T-E, so position 5 is E? S-L-A-T-E, positions: 1=S,2=L,3=A,4=T,5=E. T in position 4.

But position 4 is T, which is new.

Another: FLAME: F-L-A-M-E.

M in position 4.

PHASE: P-H-A-S-E, S in position 4 and position 1? Positions: 1=P,2=H,3=A,4=S,5=E. S in both, but it's ok if S is there.

P H A S E.

Brave: B-R-A-V-E but R is absent, cannot use.

So avoid R.

So possible: SHAKE, STAKE, FLAME, PHASE, PLATE, but PLATE has L and T, but P-L-A-T-E, positions: 1=P,2=L,3=A,4=T,5=E.

All fine.

Now, I need to maximize information. SHAKE has S, H, K which are different.

But H might be less common.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.

A word with S and T could be good.

Try STAKE: S-T-A-K-E. But STAKE is a word.

S, T, A, K, E.

K is not that common.

FLAME: F-L-A-M-E. F, L, M.

PHASE: P-H-A-S-E. P, H, S.

Perhaps SLATE, but SLATE is S-L-A-T-E, and T in position 4.

SLATE is popular for Wordle.

But in SLATE, position 1=S,2=L,3=A,4=T,5=E.

And S, L, T are all common.

I could guess ""SLATE"".

But in my first guess, I used C,R,A,N,E. Now S,L,T are new.

SLATE seems fine.

Another option is ""PLATE"": P-L-A-T-E, similar.

Or ""TRACE"", but T-R-A-C-E, but C is absent, R is absent, and T is new? Positions:1=T,2=R,3=A,4=C,5=E. But R and C are absent, so I cannot use R or C.

So TRACE would be invalid because it contains R and C, which are not in the word? No, the word doesn't contain R and C, so if I guess TRACE, it would have incorrect letters.

But in the rules, the guess must be a valid English word, but it might contain letters that are absent, which is fine, but I'll get feedback that they are not in the secret word.

But since I know C and R are absent, I should avoid using them to save guesses and get information on other letters.

So better not to use C or R.

Similarly for N.

So avoid C,R,N.

For SLATE: S-L-A-T-E, no C,R,N used.

S, L, T are all possible.

L is a common letter.

Similarly, PLATE: P-L-A-T-E, also fine.

But I used P in CRANE? No, CRANE has C,R,A,N,E, no P.

Perhaps ""PHASE"" but H might be less common.

I think SLATE is a good choice.

But let me confirm the feedback rules.

After guessing SLATE, if secret word has S, L, T in positions or not.

But I don't know yet.

Since I need to find the word with A in 3 and E in 5, and C,R,N absent.

Let me think of possible English words with pattern _ _ A _ E.

Common ones: SHAKE, STAKE, SLATE, PLATE, GRAPE? G-R-A-P-E but R absent, cannot.

FLAME, GLADE? G-L-A-D-E, but D new.

BLAME, etc.

SHAME: S-H-A-M-E.

Many options.

To get more coverage, I could choose a word with common missing letters.

In my first guess, I used A,E,C,R,N.

C,R,N are out, so remaining common letters: S,T,L,I,O,U,B,D,G,F, etc.

In SLATE, I use S,L,T.

If I use ""POISE"", but no A and E fixed? I have to keep A and E in position 3 and 5? No, I don't have to, but if I don't, I might miss information.

If I guess a word without A in position 3 or E in position 5, but I know they are correct, so I should include them to ensure my guess follows the known correct positions, so that I can find incorrect positions elsewhere.

For example, if I guess a word with E not in position 5, but since E is in the word and position 5 is correct, it would show as wrong position if I put it elsewhere, which I already know it shouldn't be elsewhere.

But to keep things simple, I should keep the known correct letters in place.

So position 3 must be A, position 5 must be E.

So my guess should have A in position 3 and E in position 5.

Then only positions 1,2,4 need guessing.

Letters to avoid: C, R, N.

For position 4, it cannot be N, and since N is absent, I must use another consonant or vowel.

Position 4 is the fourth letter, which could be a consonant or vowel, like in SHAKE it's K, STAKE it's K, SLATE it's T, FLAME it's M, etc.

Now, to maximize information, I should choose a word with letters that are high frequency and can reveal more.

S, T, L are good choices.

Another word: ""SLATE"" is S-L-A-T-E.

Position 4 is T.

""PLATE"" is P-L-A-T-E.

""SLIME"" but SLIME is S-L-I-M-E, but position 3 should be A, not I.

So must be A in position 3.

So SLATE or PLATE are fine.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" for my second guess.

Then feedback will show for S, L, T.

S in position 1, L in position 2, T in position 4.

If S is present or not, L, etc.

Similarly for others.

So, guess ""SLATE"".

But in the feedback format, it's for each position.

I think it's a reasonable guess.

Since A and E are fixed, I need to guess the other letters.

Another common choice is ""SHADE"", but H and D.

""BLADE"" has L and D.

But perhaps SLATE is better.

I think I'll stick with SLATE.

So second guess: SLATEBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓), I know the following:
- The secret word has A in the third position and E in the fifth position, so the pattern is _ _ A _ E.
- C, R, and N are not in the secret word at all, so I must avoid these letters in my guess.

For my second guess, I should:
- Keep A in position 3 and E in position 5 to maintain the known correct positions.
- Focus on testing new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4 to gather more information.
- Avoid using C, R, or N, as they are confirmed absent.
- Use high-frequency English letters to maximize the chance of hitting present letters (e.g., S, T, L, D, P, M).

Considering possible words that fit this pattern, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice:
- It has S in position 1, L in position 2, A in position 3 (fixed), T in position 4, and E in position 5 (fixed).
- It introduces new letters: S, L, and T, which are common and can provide useful feedback on their presence/positions.
- Alternatives like ""SHAKE"" or ""PLATE"" were considered, but ""SLATE"" offers a good balance of common letters.

By guessing ""SLATE"", I can get feedback on S, L, and T:
- If S is in the word and/or correct position, it could reveal position 1.
- Similarly for L in position 2.
- For T in position 4, I can confirm if it fits or is present elsewhere.

This should help narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)

So, we know:
- The word has A in position 3 and E in position 5: _ _ A _ E
- C, R, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: SLATE
- S: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, position 3)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)

So, from this:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1). So the word starts with S: S _ A _ E
- L is not in the word at all. So we add L to the absent letters.
- T is not in the word at all. So we add T to the absent letters.

Now, we know:
- The word is S _ A _ E
- Absent letters: C, R, N, L, T
- Present and correctly placed: S (pos1), A (pos3), E (pos5)

We need to find the second and fourth letters.

The second position (position 2) and fourth position (position 4) are unknown.

We have to avoid the absent letters: C, R, N, L, T.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we need to fill in positions 2 and 4 with letters that are not in the absent list.

Common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (but we have to form a valid English word).

The pattern is: S _ A _ E

Possible words:
- We need to consider what letters can go in position 2 and position 4.

Since we have only two positions to guess, and we have 6 tries, we can make a guess that uses common letters to test.

But note: we don't know if the letters in position 2 and 4 are vowels or consonants. Position 2 could be a vowel (like in ""SHADE"") or a consonant (like in ""SPACE"", but C is absent, so not).

Let's list possible words that fit S _ A _ E and avoid C,R,N,L,T.

Some possibilities:
- SHADE: S H A D E -> H in pos2, D in pos4
- SHAME: S H A M E -> H in pos2, M in pos4
- SHAVE: S H A V E -> H in pos2, V in pos4
- SHAPE: S H A P E -> H in pos2, P in pos4
- SKATE: but K is possible? S K A T E -> but T is absent, so not allowed (T is absent, so we can't use T)
- SPADE: S P A D E -> P in pos2, D in pos4
- STAGE: but T is absent, so no.
- SOARE? Not common, and O in pos2, R is absent? R is absent, so if we use R, it's invalid. But SOARE might not be accepted.

We need valid English words.

Common words: SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE, etc.

We also have to consider that position 4 must be a letter that can form a word.

Now, from the feedback, we know that L and T are absent, so we can eliminate any word containing L or T.

In our next guess, we should try to cover multiple possibilities.

We have two positions to guess: 2 and 4.

We can choose a word that uses common letters for these positions.

For example, let's use H for position 2 and D for position 4: SHADE.

But if we do that, we only test one possibility.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has a different letter in position 2 to test more.

But we have to keep S, A, E fixed.

So the guess must be S in pos1, A in pos3, E in pos5.

We can only vary pos2 and pos4.

To maximize information, we should choose letters that are common and not yet tested.

So far, we have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T.

A and E are known and fixed, S is fixed.

We have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

For position 2, common letters: H, P, M, D, etc.

For position 4, common letters: D, M, P, V, etc.

We can guess ""SHADE"" to test H and D.

If H is in the word and in position, or D in position, we get feedback.

Similarly, ""SHAME"" tests H and M.

But we can only guess one.

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that might be the answer or cover frequent letters.

Another idea: use a word that has a vowel in position 2 to see if there is another vowel, but we already have A and E, so it might be consonant-heavy.

List of possible words fitting S _ A _ E without C,R,N,L,T:

- SHADE (H,D)
- SHAME (H,M)
- SHAVE (H,V)
- SHAPE (H,P) - but P is a consonant
- SPADE (P,D) - P in pos2, D in pos4
- SKATE is invalid because of T
- SMITE? But I in pos2, M in pos4, but SMITE is S-M-I-T-E, but position 3 is I? No, we need A in position 3. SMITE has M in position 2? S-M-I-T-E, so position 2 is M, position 3 is I, but we need position 3 to be A, so not.

The word must have A in position 3, so it must be S ? A ? E.

So only position 2 and 4 vary.

Other words: 
- STALE? But T and L are absent, so no.
- SCALE? C and L absent, no.
- So, back to: SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE, etc.

Also, ""SPARE"" but R is absent, so no.

""SNARE"" has N and R, both absent.

""SWEAT"" but position 5 is T, not E, and T absent.

No, must end with E.

""SOAPY"" not ending with E.

So, common ones: SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE.

Also, ""STAGE"" has T, absent.

""SUAVE"": S U A V E -> U in pos2, V in pos4. That's possible.

""SUAVE"" is a word.

Similarly, ""SPACE"" has C, absent.

So possible words: SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE, SUAVE.

Now, we need to choose one for the next guess.

We can pick ""SHADE"" to test H and D.

But if we guess SHADE and it's wrong, we might not get much information about other letters.

Since we have multiple options, we can choose a word that uses letters that are in many possibilities.

For example, H appears in SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE.

D appears in SHADE, SPADE.

M appears in SHAME.

V in SHAVE.

P in SHAPE and SPADE.

U in SUAVE.

If I guess ""SHAPE"", for example, I test H and P.

If H is correct in position 2, and P in position 4, then it's SHAPE.

If H is correct but P is wrong, then P might be absent or wrong position, but position 4 is the only unknown, so if P is not in position 4, it might be absent or in another position, but the only positions are 2 and 4, and position 2 is H? In SHAPE, position 2 is H, position 4 is P.

If after guess, H is marked correct, then position 2 is H, and if P is marked correct, then position 4 is P.

If P is absent, then we know P is not in the word, and position 4 is something else.

Similarly for H.

But H is only in position 2 in these words, so if H is absent, then we know position 2 is not H, and H is not in the word.

Similarly for P.

But let's see the feedback possibilities.

To cover more ground, I could choose a word with a letter that is in multiple options, like H.

But I think for the third guess, since we have only two positions, we can make a direct guess.

We have 4 guesses left (since 2 used, total 6).

But let's be efficient.

Another idea: use a word that has a letter that can be in position 4, but we put it in position 2 to test, but we have to keep the fixed letters.

We cannot change S, A, E.

So only positions 2 and 4 are free.

I think I'll go with ""SHADE"" as a common word.

Then, if it's not, we get feedback on H and D.

But let's see.

Perhaps ""SPADE"" to test P and D.

But I think SHADE is fine.

Since S is fixed, and we have A and E, the word is likely to have a consonant in position 2 and a consonant in position 4, or sometimes a vowel.

For example, SUAVE has U (vowel) in position 2.

But U is less common.

I think I'll guess ""SHADE"".

So, guess: SHADE

But let's confirm the format.

In the feedback, for SHADE, we will get:

Position 1: S - should be correct (since we know it is)

Position 2: H - we'll see if it's present and correct

Position 3: A - correct

Position 4: D - present and position?

Position 5: E - correct

But we need to see the feedback.

If H is correct, then position 2 is H, and if D is correct, then it's SHADE.

If not, we know more.

But there are other possibilities like SHAME, etc.

To save a guess, we could guess a word that has multiple possibilities, but with only two positions, it's hard.

I think it's acceptable.

Another common word: ""SHINE"" but position 3 is I, not A, so no.

Must have A in position 3.

So, I'll go with ""SHADE"".

But let's list the possible words again to be sure:

- SHADE: S H A D E
- SHAME: S H A M E
- SHAVE: S H A V E
- SHAPE: S H A P E
- SPADE: S P A D E
- SUAVE: S U A V E

Also, ""STAVE"" has T, absent.

""SCALE"" has C and L, absent.

So about 6 possibilities.

If I guess ""SHADE"", and it's not correct, then:

- If H is correct, then position 2 is H, and D must be wrong (since word is not SHADE), so D is either absent or in wrong position. But position 4 is the only place, so if D is present but not in position 4, it must be in another position, but positions 1,3,5 are fixed, so D can only be in position 2 or 4. But position 2 is H (if correct), so D cannot be there, so if D is present, it must be in position 4, but if it's not correct, then D is absent. Similarly, if H is absent, then position 2 is not H, and H is not in the word.

Similarly for other cases.

But it might be messy.

To test more letters, I could guess a word that has a letter not in the possible set, but that might not be efficient.

For example, guess ""SUMPT"" but not a word, and we have to have A and E.

I think I should stick with a real possibility.

Perhaps ""SHAPE"" to test H and P.

If H is correct and P is correct, it's SHAPE.

If H correct, P absent, then position 4 is not P, and P absent, so the word could be SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE (if H is present).

But if H is correct, then position 2 is H, so the word is S H A ? E, and ? in position 4 must be D, M, V, or P (if not absent).

Similarly.

I think for simplicity, I'll guess ""SHADE"".

But let's see the feedback from the assistant.

The user said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" with previous feedback.

I need to output the guess.

I think ""SHADE"" is a reasonable choice.

So, <guess>shade</guess>

But to be more strategic, since we have SUAVE, which has U, a vowel, we might want to test if there is a vowel in position 2.

But I think SHADE is fine.

I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  
  This reveals:
  - A is in the correct position (position 3).
  - E is in the correct position (position 5).
  - C, R, and N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: SLATE** → Feedback: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)  
  This reveals:
  - S is in the correct position (position 1).
  - A and E remain correct in positions 3 and 5.
  - L and T are not in the word.

### Current Knowledge:
- The secret word has the pattern: **S _ A _ E** (positions: 1=S, 3=A, 5=E).
- Confirmed absent letters: **C, R, N, L, T** (must avoid these).
- Positions to solve: **2 and 4**.
- Possible letters for positions 2 and 4: Any English letter except C, R, N, L, T. Common options include B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Since only positions 2 and 4 are unknown, the next guess should test high-frequency letters for these positions to narrow down possibilities.
- Keep S, A, and E fixed in positions 1, 3, and 5 to maintain known correct positions.
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, L, T).
- Common words fitting the pattern **S _ A _ E** include SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE, and SUAVE.
- I choose **SHADE** for the third guess because:
  - It tests **H** (position 2) and **D** (position 4), both common letters not yet tried.
  - If H is correct, it could confirm position 2; if D is correct, it could confirm position 4.
  - Feedback will quickly eliminate possibilities (e.g., if H is absent, words like SHAME or SHAVE are ruled out; if D is absent, SPADE is ruled out).

E is correct and in position 5.\n\nI know that:\n- The secret word has A in the third position.\n- The secret word has E in the fifth position.\n- C is not in the word.\n- R is not in the word.\n- N is not in the word.\n\nAlso, since positions matter, and these are marked as not in the word, they are absent.\n\nNow, I need to make a second guess. My goal is to deduce more letters in the word.\n\nThe secret word has the form _ _ A _ E, since positions 3 and 5 are fixed as A and E.\n\nPositions: Let\'s index them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n- Position 3: A (fixed)\n- Position 5: E (fixed)\n- Position 1: not C\n- Position 2: not R\n- Position 4: not N\n\nBut R and C are not in the word at all, not just wrong position.\n\nC(x) means C is not in the word.\nR(x) means R is not in the word.\nN(x) means N is not in the word.\n\nA(✓) means A is in position 3.\nE(✓) means E is in position 5.\n\nAlso, since feedback shows ""not in the word"", those letters are absent.\n\nSo the word has A in 3rd and E in 5th, and lacks C, R, N entirely.\n\nNow, common English words with this pattern: _ _ A _ E\n\nI need to guess a word that includes new letters to test.\n\nPossible letters to try: since C, R, N are out, I should use other common consonants and vowels.\n\nVowels: A is already in place, E in place. But A and E are used. Other vowels could be in other positions.\n\nPosition 3 and 5 are fixed, so positions 1, 2, and 4 are variable.\n\nPosition 4 was not N, and N is absent.\n\nI should avoid using C, R, N in my guess.\n\nMy second guess should have A in position 3 and E in position 5 to maintain that, but since they are fixed, I can include them to confirm, but I already know they are there, so I don\'t need to reuse them necessarily, but I can keep them to get information about other positions.\n\nIn Wordle strategy, it\'s often good to keep correct letters in place to narrow down the word.\n\nBut here, position 5 is E, fixed, so I should keep E there. Similarly, position 3 is A, fixed.\n\nSo my guess should have A in position 3 and E in position 5.\n\nThat leaves positions 1, 2, and 4 to guess.\n\nFor position 4, I know N is not there and not in the word, so I need to try a different letter.\n\nAlso, I need to introduce new letters to test.\n\nI should choose a word that has A in 3, E in 5, and new letters in 1,2,4.\n\nAvoiding C, R, N.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, etc.\n\nLet me think of possible words ending with E and with A in the middle.\n\nPattern: _ _ A _ E\n\nExamples:\n- SHAKE\n- STAKE\n- PLAKE? Not a word.\n- STAKE: S-T-A-K-E\n- But K may be good.\n- PHASE: P-H-A-S-E\n- BLAME: B-L-A-M-E\n- FLAME: F-L-A-M-E\n- GRADE: G-R-A-D-E but R is absent, since R(x) from guess 1, so cannot use R.\nR is not in the word, so Grade has R, which is invalid.\n\nSince R is not in the word, I must not include R.\n\nSimilarly, C and N are not in the word.\n\nIn ""CRANE"", R was in position 2, and it\'s absent, so R is not in the word.\n\nTherefore, in my guess, I should avoid C, R, N.\n\nPossible words: let\'s list some.\n\n- SHAKE: S in 1, H in 2, A in 3, K in 4, E in 5. S, H, K are new.\n- STAKE: S-T-A-K-E. T is new.\n- But STAKE has T, which could be ok.\n- PLAKE not a word.\n- SLATE: S-L-A-T-E but position 5 is T? No, SLATE is S-L-A-T-E, so position 5 is E? S-L-A-T-E, positions: 1=S,2=L,3=A,4=T,5=E. T in position 4.\n\nBut position 4 is T, which is new.\n\nAnother: FLAME: F-L-A-M-E.\n\nM in position 4.\n\nPHASE: P-H-A-S-E, S in position 4 and position 1? Positions: 1=P,2=H,3=A,4=S,5=E. S in both, but it\'s ok if S is there.\n\nP H A S E.\n\nBrave: B-R-A-V-E but R is absent, cannot use.\n\nSo avoid R.\n\nSo possible: SHAKE, STAKE, FLAME, PHASE, PLATE, but PLATE has L and T, but P-L-A-T-E, positions: 1=P,2=L,3=A,4=T,5=E.\n\nAll fine.\n\nNow, I need to maximize information. SHAKE has S, H, K which are different.\n\nBut H might be less common.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.\n\nA word with S and T could be good.\n\nTry STAKE: S-T-A-K-E. But STAKE is a word.\n\nS, T, A, K, E.\n\nK is not that common.\n\nFLAME: F-L-A-M-E. F, L, M.\n\nPHASE: P-H-A-S-E. P, H, S.\n\nPerhaps SLATE, but SLATE is S-L-A-T-E, and T in position 4.\n\nSLATE is popular for Wordle.\n\nBut in SLATE, position 1=S,2=L,3=A,4=T,5=E.\n\nAnd S, L, T are all common.\n\nI could guess ""SLATE"".\n\nBut in my first guess, I used C,R,A,N,E. Now S,L,T are new.\n\nSLATE seems fine.\n\nAnother option is ""PLATE"": P-L-A-T-E, similar.\n\nOr ""TRACE"", but T-R-A-C-E, but C is absent, R is absent, and T is new? Positions:1=T,2=R,3=A,4=C,5=E. But R and C are absent, so I cannot use R or C.\n\nSo TRACE would be invalid because it contains R and C, which are not in the word? No, the word doesn\'t contain R and C, so if I guess TRACE, it would have incorrect letters.\n\nBut in the rules, the guess must be a valid English word, but it might contain letters that are absent, which is fine, but I\'ll get feedback that they are not in the secret word.\n\nBut since I know C and R are absent, I should avoid using them to save guesses and get information on other letters.\n\nSo better not to use C or R.\n\nSimilarly for N.\n\nSo avoid C,R,N.\n\nFor SLATE: S-L-A-T-E, no C,R,N used.\n\nS, L, T are all possible.\n\nL is a common letter.\n\nSimilarly, PLATE: P-L-A-T-E, also fine.\n\nBut I used P in CRANE? No, CRANE has C,R,A,N,E, no P.\n\nPerhaps ""PHASE"" but H might be less common.\n\nI think SLATE is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm the feedback rules.\n\nAfter guessing SLATE, if secret word has S, L, T in positions or not.\n\nBut I don\'t know yet.\n\nSince I need to find the word with A in 3 and E in 5, and C,R,N absent.\n\nLet me think of possible English words with pattern _ _ A _ E.\n\nCommon ones: SHAKE, STAKE, SLATE, PLATE, GRAPE? G-R-A-P-E but R absent, cannot.\n\nFLAME, GLADE? G-L-A-D-E, but D new.\n\nBLAME, etc.\n\nSHAME: S-H-A-M-E.\n\nMany options.\n\nTo get more coverage, I could choose a word with common missing letters.\n\nIn my first guess, I used A,E,C,R,N.\n\nC,R,N are out, so remaining common letters: S,T,L,I,O,U,B,D,G,F, etc.\n\nIn SLATE, I use S,L,T.\n\nIf I use ""POISE"", but no A and E fixed? I have to keep A and E in position 3 and 5? No, I don\'t have to, but if I don\'t, I might miss information.\n\nIf I guess a word without A in position 3 or E in position 5, but I know they are correct, so I should include them to ensure my guess follows the known correct positions, so that I can find incorrect positions elsewhere.\n\nFor example, if I guess a word with E not in position 5, but since E is in the word and position 5 is correct, it would show as wrong position if I put it elsewhere, which I already know it shouldn\'t be elsewhere.\n\nBut to keep things simple, I should keep the known correct letters in place.\n\nSo position 3 must be A, position 5 must be E.\n\nSo my guess should have A in position 3 and E in position 5.\n\nThen only positions 1,2,4 need guessing.\n\nLetters to avoid: C, R, N.\n\nFor position 4, it cannot be N, and since N is absent, I must use another consonant or vowel.\n\nPosition 4 is the fourth letter, which could be a consonant or vowel, like in SHAKE it\'s K, STAKE it\'s K, SLATE it\'s T, FLAME it\'s M, etc.\n\nNow, to maximize information, I should choose a word with letters that are high frequency and can reveal more.\n\nS, T, L are good choices.\n\nAnother word: ""SLATE"" is S-L-A-T-E.\n\nPosition 4 is T.\n\n""PLATE"" is P-L-A-T-E.\n\n""SLIME"" but SLIME is S-L-I-M-E, but position 3 should be A, not I.\n\nSo must be A in position 3.\n\nSo SLATE or PLATE are fine.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SLATE"" for my second guess.\n\nThen feedback will show for S, L, T.\n\nS in position 1, L in position 2, T in position 4.\n\nIf S is present or not, L, etc.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo, guess ""SLATE"".\n\nBut in the feedback format, it\'s for each position.\n\nI think it\'s a reasonable guess.\n\nSince A and E are fixed, I need to guess the other letters.\n\nAnother common choice is ""SHADE"", but H and D.\n\n""BLADE"" has L and D.\n\nBut perhaps SLATE is better.\n\nI think I\'ll stick with SLATE.\n\nSo second guess: SLATEBased on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓), I know the following:\n- The secret word has A in the third position and E in the fifth position, so the pattern is _ _ A _ E.\n- C, R, and N are not in the secret word at all, so I must avoid these letters in my guess.\n\nFor my second guess, I should:\n- Keep A in position 3 and E in position 5 to maintain the known correct positions.\n- Focus on testing new letters in positions 1, 2, and 4 to gather more information.\n- Avoid using C, R, or N, as they are confirmed absent.\n- Use high-frequency English letters to maximize the chance of hitting present letters (e.g., S, T, L, D, P, M).\n\nConsidering possible words that fit this pattern, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice:\n- It has S in position 1, L in position 2, A in position 3 (fixed), T in position 4, and E in position 5 (fixed).\n- It introduces new letters: S, L, and T, which are common and can provide useful feedback on their presence/positions.\n- Alternatives like ""SHAKE"" or ""PLATE"" were considered, but ""SLATE"" offers a good balance of common letters.\n\nBy guessing ""SLATE"", I can get feedback on S, L, and T:\n- If S is in the word and/or correct position, it could reveal position 1.\n- Similarly for L in position 2.\n- For T in position 4, I can confirm if it fits or is present elsewhere.\n\nThis should help narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.\n\n<guess>slate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, position 3)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The word has A in position 3 and E in position 5: _ _ A _ E\n- C, R, N are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: SLATE\n- S: ✓ (correct position, position 1)\n- L: x (not in the word)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, position 3)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, position 5)\n\nSo, from this:\n- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1). So the word starts with S: S _ A _ E\n- L is not in the word at all. So we add L to the absent letters.\n- T is not in the word at all.

Position 2 could be a vowel (like in ""SHADE"") or a consonant (like in ""SPACE"", but C is absent, so not).\n\nLet\'s list possible words that fit S _ A _ E and avoid C,R,N,L,T.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- SHADE: S H A D E -> H in pos2, D in pos4\n- SHAME: S H A M E -> H in pos2, M in pos4\n- SHAVE: S H A V E -> H in pos2, V in pos4\n- SHAPE: S H A P E -> H in pos2, P in pos4\n- SKATE: but K is possible? S K A T E -> but T is absent, so not allowed (T is absent, so we can\'t use T)\n- SPADE: S P A D E -> P in pos2, D in pos4\n- STAGE: but T is absent, so no.\n- SOARE? Not common, and O in pos2, R is absent? R is absent, so if we use R, it\'s invalid. But SOARE might not be accepted.\n\nWe need valid English words.\n\nCommon words: SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE, etc.\n\nWe also have to consider that position 4 must be a letter that can form a word.\n\nNow, from the feedback, we know that L and T are absent, so we can eliminate any word containing L or T.\n\nIn our next guess, we should try to cover multiple possibilities.\n\nWe have two positions to guess: 2 and 4.\n\nWe can choose a word that uses common letters for these positions.\n\nFor example, let\'s use H for position 2 and D for position 4: SHADE.\n\nBut if we do that, we only test one possibility.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has a different letter in position 2 to test more.\n\nBut we have to keep S, A, E fixed.\n\nSo the guess must be S in pos1, A in pos3, E in pos5.\n\nWe can only vary pos2 and pos4.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose letters that are common and not yet tested.\n\nSo far, we have tested: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T.\n\nA and E are known and fixed, S is fixed.\n\nWe have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nFor position 2, common letters: H, P, M, D, etc.\n\nFor position 4, common letters: D, M, P, V, etc.\n\nWe can guess ""SHADE"" to test H and D.\n\nIf H is in the word and in position, or D in position, we get feedback.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHAME"" tests H and M.\n\nBut we can only guess one.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that might be the answer or cover frequent letters.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that has a vowel in position 2 to see if there is another vowel, but we already have A and E, so it might be consonant-heavy.\n\nList of possible words fitting S _ A _ E without C,R,N,L,T:\n\n- SHADE (H,D)\n- SHAME (H,M)\n- SHAVE (H,V)\n- SHAPE (H,P) - but P is a consonant\n- SPADE (P,D) - P in pos2, D in pos4\n- SKATE is invalid because of T\n- SMITE? But I in pos2, M in pos4, but SMITE is S-M-I-T-E, but position 3 is I? No, we need A in position 3. SMITE has M in position 2? S-M-I-T-E, so position 2 is M, position 3 is I, but we need position 3 to be A, so not.\n\nThe word must have A in position 3, so it must be S ? A ? E.\n\nSo only position 2 and 4 vary.\n\nOther words: \n- STALE? But T and L are absent, so no.\n- SCALE? C and L absent, no.\n- So, back to: SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE, etc.\n\nAlso, ""SPARE"" but R is absent, so no.\n\n""SNARE"" has N and R, both absent.\n\n""SWEAT"" but position 5 is T, not E, and T absent.\n\nNo, must end with E.\n\n""SOAPY"" not ending with E.\n\nSo, common ones: SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE.\n\nAlso, ""STAGE"" has T, absent.\n\n""SUAVE"": S U A V E -> U in pos2, V in pos4. That\'s possible.\n\n""SUAVE"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""SPACE"" has C, absent.\n\nSo possible words: SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE, SUAVE.\n\nNow, we need to choose one for the next guess.\n\nWe can pick ""SHADE"" to test H and D.\n\nBut if we guess SHADE and it\'s wrong, we might not get much information about other letters.\n\nSince we have multiple options, we can choose a word that uses letters that are in many possibilities.\n\nFor example, H appears in SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE.\n\nD appears in SHADE, SPADE.\n\nM appears in SHAME.\n\nV in SHAVE.\n\nP in SHAPE and SPADE.\n\nU in SUAVE.\n\nIf I guess ""SHAPE"", for example, I test H and P.\n\nIf H is correct in position 2, and P in position 4, then it\'s SHAPE.\n\nIf H is correct but P is wrong, then P might be absent or wrong position, but position 4 is the only unknown, so if P is not in position 4, it might be absent or in another position, but the only positions are 2 and 4, and position 2 is H? In SHAPE, position 2 is H, position 4 is P.\n\nIf after guess, H is marked correct, then position 2 is H, and if P is marked correct, then position 4 is P.\n\nIf P is absent, then we know P is not in the word, and position 4 is something else.\n\nSimilarly for H.\n\nBut H is only in position 2 in these words, so if H is absent, then we know position 2 is not H, and H is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly for P.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback possibilities.\n\nTo cover more ground, I could choose a word with a letter that is in multiple options, like H.\n\nBut I think for the third guess, since we have only two positions, we can make a direct guess.\n\nWe have 4 guesses left (since 2 used, total 6).\n\nBut let\'s be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that has a letter that can be in position 4, but we put it in position 2 to test, but we have to keep the fixed letters.\n\nWe cannot change S, A, E.\n\nSo only positions 2 and 4 are free.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""SHADE"" as a common word.\n\nThen, if it\'s not, we get feedback on H and D.\n\nBut let\'s see.\n\nPerhaps ""SPADE"" to test P and D.\n\nBut I think SHADE is fine.\n\nSince S is fixed, and we have A and E, the word is likely to have a consonant in position 2 and a consonant in position 4, or sometimes a vowel.\n\nFor example, SUAVE has U (vowel) in position 2.\n\nBut U is less common.\n\nI think I\'ll guess ""SHADE"".\n\nSo, guess: SHADE\n\nBut let\'s confirm the format.\n\nIn the feedback, for SHADE, we will get:\n\nPosition 1: S - should be correct (since we know it is)\n\nPosition 2: H - we\'ll see if it\'s present and correct\n\nPosition 3: A - correct\n\nPosition 4: D - present and position?\n\nPosition 5: E - correct\n\nBut we need to see the feedback.\n\nIf H is correct, then position 2 is H, and if D is correct, then it\'s SHADE.\n\nIf not, we know more.\n\nBut there are other possibilities like SHAME, etc.\n\nTo save a guess, we could guess a word that has multiple possibilities, but with only two positions, it\'s hard.\n\nI think it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother common word: ""SHINE"" but position 3 is I, not A, so no.\n\nMust have A in position 3.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""SHADE"".\n\nBut let\'s list the possible words again to be sure:\n\n- SHADE: S H A D E\n- SHAME: S H A M E\n- SHAVE: S H A V E\n- SHAPE: S H A P E\n- SPADE: S P A D E\n- SUAVE: S U A V E\n\nAlso, ""STAVE"" has T, absent.\n\n""SCALE"" has C and L, absent.\n\nSo about 6 possibilities.\n\nIf I guess ""SHADE"", and it\'s not correct, then:\n\n- If H is correct, then position 2 is H, and D must be wrong (since word is not SHADE), so D is either absent or in wrong position. But position 4 is the only place, so if D is present but not in position 4, it must be in another position, but positions 1,3,5 are fixed, so D can only be in position 2 or 4. But position 2 is H (if correct), so D cannot be there, so if D is present, it must be in position 4, but if it\'s not correct, then D is absent. Similarly, if H is absent, then position 2 is not H, and H is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly for other cases.\n\nBut it might be messy.\n\nTo test more letters, I could guess a word that has a letter not in the possible set, but that might not be efficient.\n\nFor example, guess ""SUMPT"" but not a word, and we have to have A and E.\n\nI think I should stick with a real possibility.\n\nPerhaps ""SHAPE"" to test H and P.\n\nIf H is correct and P is correct, it\'s SHAPE.\n\nIf H correct, P absent, then position 4 is not P, and P absent, so the word could be SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE (if H is present).\n\nBut if H is correct, then position 2 is H, so the word is S H A ? E, and ? in position 4 must be D, M, V, or P (if not absent).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think for simplicity, I\'ll guess ""SHADE"".\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback from the assistant.\n\nThe user said ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"" with previous feedback.\n\nI need to output the guess.\n\nI think ""SHADE"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nSo, <guess>shade</guess>\n\nBut to be more strategic, since we have SUAVE, which has U, a vowel, we might want to test if there is a vowel in position 2.\n\nBut I think SHADE is fine.\n\nI\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  \n  This reveals:\n  - A is in the correct position (position 3).\n  - E is in the correct position (position 5).\n  - C, R, and N are not in the word.\n\n- **Guess 2: SLATE** → Feedback: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)  \n  This reveals:\n  - S is in the correct position (position 1).\n  - A and E remain correct in positions 3 and 5.\n  - L and T are not in the word.\n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- The secret word has the pattern: **S _ A _ E** (positions: 1=S, 3=A, 5=E).\n- Confirmed absent letters: **C, R, N, L, T** (must avoid these).\n- Positions to solve: **2 and 4**.\n- Possible letters for positions 2 and 4: Any English letter except C, R, N, L, T. Common options include B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, etc.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Since only positions 2 and 4 are unknown, the next guess should test high-frequency letters for these positions to narrow down possibilities.\n- Keep S, A, and E fixed in positions 1, 3, and 5 to maintain known correct positions.\n- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, L, T).\n- Common words fitting the pattern **S _ A _ E** include SHADE, SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SPADE, and SUAVE.\n- I choose **SHADE** for the third guess because:\n  - It tests **H** (position 2) and **D** (position 4), both common letters not yet tried.\n  - If H is correct, it could confirm position 2; if D is correct, it could confirm position 4.\n  - Feedback will quickly eliminate possibilities (e.g., if H is absent, words like SHAME or SHAVE are ruled out; if D is absent, SPADE is ruled out).\n\n<guess>shade</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: shade -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C(x): C is not in the word
- R(x): R is not in the word
- A(✓): A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)
- N(x): N is not in the word
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)

Guess 2: SLATE
- S(✓): S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1)
- L(x): L is not in the word
- A(✓): A is correct (position 3)
- T(x): T is not in the word
- E(✓): E is correct (position 5)

Guess 3: SHADE
- S(✓): S is correct (position 1)
- H(✓): H is in the word and in the correct position (position 2)
- A(✓): A is correct (position 3)
- D(x): D is not in the word
- E(✓): E is correct (position 5)

So, from all feedback:

- The word has S in position 1, H in position 2, A in position 3, and E in position 5. So the pattern is: S H A _ E
- Only position 4 is missing.

- Absent letters: C, R, N, L, T, D (from the x's)

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""SHA"", ends with ""E"", and has a letter in position 4 that is not C, R, N, L, T, or D.

Possible letters for position 4: any letter except the absent ones. Since we have S,H,A,E fixed, and position 4 must be a letter that forms a valid English word.

Common words with ""SHA_E"":

- SHAME: S H A M E
- SHAVE: S H A V E
- SHAPE: S H A P E
- SHALE: but L is absent, so not possible
- SHARE: R is absent, not possible
- SHAKE: K is possible? We haven't tested K.

K has not been used or marked absent, so it could be.

Similarly, M, P, V, etc.

From the feedback, D is absent, so SHADE is not the word.

Now, we need to guess the fourth letter.

Since only one position is unknown, we can try one of the common options.

Possible words:

- SHAME (M in position 4)
- SHAVE (V in position 4)
- SHAPE (P in position 4)
- SHAKE (K in position 4)

Also, less common: SHOTE? Not a word. SHIRE? R absent. So mainly the above.

We have 3 guesses left (since 3 used, total 6).

We can guess one of these.

To be efficient, we might choose the most common one.

But let's see if we can get more information, but with only one letter, it's straightforward.

We can guess ""SHAME"" to test M.

If it's not, then we try another.

But we have multiple options, so we might need to choose.

Since we have feedback that D is absent, and we know the pattern, we can list the possibilities and pick one.

I think ""SHAKE"" is a common word, so let's try that.

But K might be less common than M or P.

In terms of frequency, M, P, V are common.

""SHAME"" and ""SHAPE"" are both common.

""SHAPE"" has P, which we haven't tested.

Similarly, ""SHAVE"" has V.

I'll go with ""SHAME"" as a guess.

Then, if it's not, we know M is absent, and we can try SHAPE or SHAVE.

Similarly.

But since position 4 is the only unknown, and we have to guess, I'll pick ""SHAME"".

So, guess: SHAME

But let's see the format.

In the response, we need to output the guess.

So, <guess>shame</guess>

But to be thorough, let's confirm.

The word is S H A ? E

Absent: C,R,N,L,T,D

So ? cannot be these.

Possible: B,F,G,I,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But must form a word: SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SHAKE, SHINE? But position 3 is A, not I, so SHINE is S-H-I-N-E, not matching.

SHORE has R and O, but R absent.

So only a few: SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SHAKE, and perhaps SHADE but D absent, no.

SHALE has L, absent.

So SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SHAKE.

Also, SHOTE not a word.

SHIRE not.

So four possibilities.

We can guess ""SHAPE"" to test P.

But I think ""SHAME"" is fine.

I'll go with that.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Knowledge from Feedback:**
   - **Position 1**: S is correct (from Guess 2: SLATE → S(✓)).
   - **Position 2**: H is correct (from Guess 3: SHADE → H(✓)).
   - **Position 3**: A is correct (consistent across all guesses).
   - **Position 4**: Unknown, but D is absent (from Guess 3: SHADE → D(x)).
   - **Position 5**: E is correct (consistent across all guesses).
   - **Absent Letters**: C, R, N, L, T (from Guess 1 and 2), and D (from Guess 3). These cannot appear in the word.
   - **Pattern**: The secret word must be **S H A _ E**, with only position 4 unknown.

2. **Possible Letters for Position 4:**
   - Must be a letter not in the absent list (C, R, N, L, T, D).
   - Common English letters that fit the pattern ""SHA_E"" include:
     - **M** (e.g., SHAME)
     - **P** (e.g., SHAPE)
     - **V** (e.g., SHAVE)
     - **K** (e.g., SHAKE)
   - Other possibilities (less common) include B, F, G, etc., but these are rare in this pattern.

3. **Strategy for Guess 4:**
   - Only position 4 needs solving, so the guess should test one of the high-frequency options.
   - ""SHAME"" is a strong choice because:
     - It tests **M** in position 4, which is common and could confirm the word if correct.
     - If M is correct, the word is solved. If not, M is absent, narrowing the options to SHAPE, SHAVE, or SHAKE for the next guess.
   - Avoid using absent letters and maintain fixed positions (S, H, A, E).

4. **Next Guess:**
   - Guess **SHAME** to efficiently test for M in position 4.

<guess>shame</guess>",shame,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C(x): C is not in the word
- R(x): R is not in the word
- A(✓): A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)
- N(x): N is not in the word
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)

Guess 2: SLATE
- S(✓): S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1)
- L(x): L is not in the word
- A(✓): A is correct (position 3)
- T(x): T is not in the word
- E(✓): E is correct (position 5)

Guess 3: SHADE
- S(✓): S is correct (position 1)
- H(✓): H is in the word and in the correct position (position 2)
- A(✓): A is correct (position 3)
- D(x): D is not in the word
- E(✓): E is correct (position 5)

So, from all feedback:

- The word has S in position 1, H in position 2, A in position 3, and E in position 5. So the pattern is: S H A _ E
- Only position 4 is missing.

- Absent letters: C, R, N, L, T, D (from the x's)

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""SHA"", ends with ""E"", and has a letter in position 4 that is not C, R, N, L, T, or D.

Possible letters for position 4: any letter except the absent ones. Since we have S,H,A,E fixed, and position 4 must be a letter that forms a valid English word.

Common words with ""SHA_E"":

- SHAME: S H A M E
- SHAVE: S H A V E
- SHAPE: S H A P E
- SHALE: but L is absent, so not possible
- SHARE: R is absent, not possible
- SHAKE: K is possible? We haven't tested K.

K has not been used or marked absent, so it could be.

Similarly, M, P, V, etc.

From the feedback, D is absent, so SHADE is not the word.

Now, we need to guess the fourth letter.

Since only one position is unknown, we can try one of the common options.

Possible words:

- SHAME (M in position 4)
- SHAVE (V in position 4)
- SHAPE (P in position 4)
- SHAKE (K in position 4)

Also, less common: SHOTE? Not a word. SHIRE? R absent. So mainly the above.

We have 3 guesses left (since 3 used, total 6).

We can guess one of these.

To be efficient, we might choose the most common one.

But let's see if we can get more information, but with only one letter, it's straightforward.

We can guess ""SHAME"" to test M.

If it's not, then we try another.

But we have multiple options, so we might need to choose.

Since we have feedback that D is absent, and we know the pattern, we can list the possibilities and pick one.

I think ""SHAKE"" is a common word, so let's try that.

But K might be less common than M or P.

In terms of frequency, M, P, V are common.

""SHAME"" and ""SHAPE"" are both common.

""SHAPE"" has P, which we haven't tested.

Similarly, ""SHAVE"" has V.

I'll go with ""SHAME"" as a guess.

Then, if it's not, we know M is absent, and we can try SHAPE or SHAVE.

Similarly.

But since position 4 is the only unknown, and we have to guess, I'll pick ""SHAME"".

So, guess: SHAME

But let's see the format.

In the response, we need to output the guess.

So, <guess>shame</guess>

But to be thorough, let's confirm.

The word is S H A ? E

Absent: C,R,N,L,T,D

So ? cannot be these.

Possible: B,F,G,I,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

But must form a word: SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SHAKE, SHINE? But position 3 is A, not I, so SHINE is S-H-I-N-E, not matching.

SHORE has R and O, but R absent.

So only a few: SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SHAKE, and perhaps SHADE but D absent, no.

SHALE has L, absent.

So SHAME, SHAVE, SHAPE, SHAKE.

Also, SHOTE not a word.

SHIRE not.

So four possibilities.

We can guess ""SHAPE"" to test P.
