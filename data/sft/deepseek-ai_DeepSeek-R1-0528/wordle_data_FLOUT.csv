We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has C, R, A, N, E — which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. The remaining consonants and vowels are:
 Vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

 We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible. Common letters in English that we haven't tried include: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""TOILS"" or ""PIOUS"", but let's try to get a word with more common letters.

 Another idea: ""SLIPT"" is not a word. We need a valid word.

 Consider ""MOIST"": 
   M, O, I, S, T — all new letters.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" is valid, but let's check the frequency. The letters S, T, L are very common.

 Another popular choice is ""SHIFT"" or ""LIGHT"", but we don't have H or G yet.

 Since we have to avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E, let's list some words:

 Possible words: 
   ""DOUBT"", ""GHOUL"", ""MIGHT"", ""PLUSH"", ""WIMPY"", etc.

 But we want to maximize the information. We should try to include as many of the most common remaining letters as possible.

 The most common letters in English (without C, R, A, N, E) are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, M, P, U, etc.

 We can try ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S — that covers five common letters.

 However, ""TOILS"" is a valid word (meaning: hard work).

 Another option: ""MOIST"" (meaning: slightly wet) — M, O, I, S, T.

 Or ""PIOUS"" (meaning: devout) — P, I, O, U, S. But note that U is less common.

 Let's choose ""MOIST"" because it has M, O, I, S, T — all of which are common and we haven't tried them.

 So, our next guess is ""MOIST"".

I considered words like ""toils"" and ""pious"" but chose **""moist""** because it:
- Uses 5 new, high-frequency letters (M, O, I, S, T)
- Covers multiple vowels (O, I) and common consonants (S, T, M)

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
2. ""moist"" -> 
   M: absent (x)
   O: present but wrong position (-)
   I: absent (x)
   S: absent (x)
   T: correct position (✓) -> so T is the last letter of the secret word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word ends with T.
- The letter O is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""moist"" it was in the second position and marked as wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Also, from the first guess, we know the word has no E, so the only vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y. But we have O in the word.

Now, the word must have O (somewhere except the second position) and ends with T.

We need to avoid: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that T is fixed at the end.

We know the word has O and T (with T at the end). Also, we have one O that is not in position 2.

Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 4 (since position 5 is T, so O cannot be there). But note: in the feedback for ""moist"", O was in position 2 and marked as present but wrong, so O must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with T, containing O (in position 1, 3, or 4), and without the forbidden letters.

Let's think of words ending with T that have an O in them (but not in the second position) and avoid the excluded letters.

Common words:
- ABOUT? But A is excluded (from first guess).
- DOUBT? D, O, U, B, T. But O is in position 2? We need to avoid position 2 for O? No, the feedback says O is present but not in position 2, so in the secret word, O is not in position 2. But in ""DOUBT"", O is in position 2. So if we guess ""DOUBT"", and if the secret word has O in position 2, then it would have been marked as correct (✓) in ""moist"" for position 2? But in ""moist"", O was in position 2 and marked as present but wrong, meaning that in the secret word, O is not in position 2. Therefore, the secret word cannot have O in position 2. So ""DOUBT"" would be invalid because if the secret word had O in position 2, it would have been correct in ""moist"", but it wasn't. So we must avoid putting O in position 2 in our next guess? Actually, we can put O anywhere, but we know it's not in position 2 in the secret word.

But in our next guess, we can try O in a different position.

We need to avoid the forbidden letters: A, C, E, I, M, N, R, S.

So for ""DOUBT"": D, O, U, B, T. 
- O is in position 2, but we know the secret word doesn't have O in position 2. So if we guess ""DOUBT"", and if the secret word has O, then the O in position 2 would get a '-' (if O is in the word but not in position 2) or 'x' (if O is not in the word at all, but we know it is). But we know O is in the word, so it would be marked as '-' for position 2. But we already know that, so it doesn't give new information? We want to test other positions.

Alternatively, we can try to put O in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let me list possible words:

- Position 1: O _ _ _ T -> e.g., ""OUCHT""? Not a word. ""Ought"" -> but G and H are allowed, but ""ought"" has G and H. But we haven't excluded H or G. ""Ought"" is a word: O, U, G, H, T. But note, we have to check if these letters are allowed. We haven't used U, G, H. So it's okay.

But we have to make sure we don't use excluded letters. Excluded: A, C, E, I, M, N, R, S. So G, H, U are okay.

But ""ought"" has O in position 1 and T in position 5. Also, O is not in position 2, which is consistent.

But we don't know if the word has U, G, H.

Another word: ""OUTPUT""? But P and U, and it's 6 letters? No, 5 letters: ""output"" is 6. 

""OUTPT"" is not a word.

How about ""OCTET""? But O is in position 1? And C is excluded. So no.

""VOLT""? 4 letters.

Let's try position 3: _ _ O _ T -> e.g., ""BLOUT""? Not a word. ""CLOUT""? C is excluded. ""FLOUT""? F, L, O, U, T. F and L are allowed. So ""flout"" is a word.

But we don't know if F and L are in the word.

Another: ""GLOAT""? G, L, O, A, T -> but A is excluded.

""THROB""? T, H, R, O, B -> but R is excluded.

""BROTH""? B, R, O, T, H -> R excluded.

We need to avoid R.

""DOZOT""? Not a word.

Position 4: _ _ _ O T -> e.g., ""BOOST""? But O is in position 2 and 3? And S is excluded. Also, we have two O's? But we don't know if the word has two O's. But in feedback, we only know there's at least one O.

""BLOOT""? Not a word.

""GROUT""? G, R, O, U, T -> R excluded.

""TROUT""? T, R, O, U, T -> R excluded and T in first position? We don't know about T in first.

We have T at the end, but T might appear elsewhere? The feedback for ""moist"" had T at the end correct, but that doesn't say anything about other T's.

But in ""moist"", the T was at the end and correct, but if there were another T, it might have been marked? But we don't have another T in the guess.

So the secret word might have more than one T.

But we don't know.

Let me think of words ending with T, containing O, and without the excluded letters.

Excluded: A, C, E, I, M, N, R, S.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And O must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Possible words:

- Position 1: O....T
  - Ought (O, U, G, H, T) -> valid
  - Outdo (O, U, T, D, O) -> but ends with O? We need T at the end. ""Outdo"" ends with O.
  - Outgo (O, U, T, G, O) -> ends with O.
  - Ovolo? Not common.

- Position 3: ..O.T
  - Blood? But ends with D, not T.
  - Flood? Ends with D.
  - Float? But A excluded.
  - Gloat? A excluded.
  - Bloat? A excluded.
  - Cloth? C excluded.
  - Sloth? S excluded.
  - Ploy? 4 letters.
  - Blunt? U and N excluded (N is excluded from first guess).
  - Flout: F, L, O, U, T -> positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). So O is in position 3. This is valid.

- Position 4: ...OT
  - Bigot? B, I, G, O, T -> but I is excluded (from second guess, I is absent).
  - Dugout? 6 letters.
  - Try ""PILOT""? P, I, L, O, T -> but I is excluded.
  - ""HOT""? 3 letters.
  - ""JOUST""? J, O, U, S, T -> S excluded.
  - ""MOULT""? M, O, U, L, T -> but M is excluded (from second guess, M absent).
  - ""POULT""? P, O, U, L, T -> P, O, U, L, T. O is in position 2? We need O in position 4? In ""POULT"", O is in position 2. We are looking for position 4. So for position 4: the fourth letter is O and fifth is T.

  Words ending with ""OT"": e.g., ""BOOT"", ""COOT"", ""FOOT"", ""HOOT"", ""LOOT"", ""MOOT"", ""POOT"", ""ROOT"", ""SOOT"", ""TOOT"" -> but many have excluded letters. Also, they are 4 letters? No, they are 4 letters? ""Boot"" is 4 letters? No, 4 letters: B-O-O-T. We need 5 letters.

  Actually, 5-letter words ending with ""OT"" are rare? Or with O in position 4 and T in 5: so the last two letters are ""OT"". But the word must be 5 letters: so pattern: ???OT.

  Examples: 
    ""BEGOT"": B, E, G, O, T -> but E excluded.
    ""BIGOT"": B, I, G, O, T -> I excluded.
    ""DEPOT"": D, E, P, O, T -> E excluded.
    ""PIVOT"": P, I, V, O, T -> I excluded.
    ""VISIT"": V, I, S, I, T -> I and S excluded.

  Not many options.

  How about ""QUOIT""? Q, U, O, I, T -> I excluded.

  ""JOUST"" has S and is 5 letters but S excluded.

  So position 4 for O is difficult.

Therefore, the best bets are words with O in position 1 or 3.

We have:
- ""ought"" (O in position 1)
- ""flout"" (O in position 3)

We also have T at the end, so we can try one of these.

But note: in ""ought"", the second letter is U, third is G, fourth is H. We don't know if these are in the word.

Similarly, in ""flout"", we have F, L, U, O, T.

We might also consider other words, like ""poult"" but that has O in position 2 which we know is wrong, so if we guess ""poult"", the O in position 2 would be marked as present but wrong (if O is in the word) but we already know that. But it doesn't help us locate O.

We want to test a new position for O.

So between ""ought"" and ""flout"", which one is better?

""ought"" has O in position 1, which we haven't tested. ""flout"" has O in position 3, which we haven't tested.

But we also want to cover new letters.

In ""ought"": letters O, U, G, H, T. We already know T is in the word (at the end) and O is in the word. So we are testing U, G, H.

In ""flout"": F, L, U, O, T. Testing F, L, U.

Which set of letters is more common? F, L, U are fairly common.

But we have no information about any of these.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has O in position 1 and also includes other common letters.

Another word: ""OUTBY""? Not a word.

""DUVET""? But ends with T? No, ends with T? D,U,V,E,T -> but E is excluded.

""DOUBT"" has O in position 2, which we know is not the position, so if we guess ""doubt"", we expect the O to be marked as '-' (since it's in the word but wrong position) and we know that. But we can use it to test D, U, B.

But we want to test O in a new position.

So I think ""ought"" or ""flout"" are good.

Let me choose ""flout"" because it tests F and L, which are common, and U.

So guess: ""flout""

But note: in ""flout"", the T is at the end, which we know is correct, so it will be marked as ✓ for T.

The O is in position 3, which we haven't tested.

So we can see if O is in position 3 or not.

If not, then O must be in position 1 or 4.

But we are guessing O in position 3.

So let's go with ""flout"".

<guess>flout</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**:
  - M and I are absent (x), so they are not in the word.
  - O is present but in the wrong position (-), meaning it is in the secret word but not in position 2.
  - T is correct and in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with T.

**Key insights**:
- The secret word **ends with T**.
- **O is in the word** but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 1, 3, or 4).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S (cannot appear in any guess).
- Available letters to use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the next guess:
- I need a word ending in **T** that includes **O** (in position 1, 3, or 4) and avoids excluded letters.
- I chose **""flout""** (F, L, O, U, T) because:
  - It tests **O in position 3** (a new position we haven't checked).
  - It covers new common letters (F, L, U) to gather more information.
  - It ends with T (already confirmed), so the feedback will focus on other positions.
  - It is a valid English word.

This guess will help locate O and test for F, L, and U in the secret word.

<guess>flout</guess>",flout,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
2. ""moist"" -> 
   M: absent (x)
   O: present but wrong position (-)
   I: absent (x)
   S: absent (x)
   T: correct position (✓) -> so T is the last letter of the secret word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word ends with T.
- The letter O is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""moist"" it was in the second position and marked as wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Also, from the first guess, we know the word has no E, so the only vowels left are O, U, and sometimes Y. But we have O in the word.

Now, the word must have O (somewhere except the second position) and ends with T.

We need to avoid: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that T is fixed at the end.

We know the word has O and T (with T at the end). Also, we have one O that is not in position 2.

Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 4 (since position 5 is T, so O cannot be there). But note: in the feedback for ""moist"", O was in position 2 and marked as present but wrong, so O must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with T, containing O (in position 1, 3, or 4), and without the forbidden letters.

Let's think of words ending with T that have an O in them (but not in the second position) and avoid the excluded letters.

Common words:
- ABOUT? But A is excluded (from first guess).
- DOUBT? D, O, U, B, T. But O is in position 2? We need to avoid position 2 for O? No, the feedback says O is present but not in position 2, so in the secret word, O is not in position 2. But in ""DOUBT"", O is in position 2. So if we guess ""DOUBT"", and if the secret word has O in position 2, then it would have been marked as correct (✓) in ""moist"" for position 2? But in ""moist"", O was in position 2 and marked as present but wrong, meaning that in the secret word, O is not in position 2. Therefore, the secret word cannot have O in position 2. So ""DOUBT"" would be invalid because if the secret word had O in position 2, it would have been correct in ""moist"", but it wasn't. So we must avoid putting O in position 2 in our next guess? Actually, we can put O anywhere, but we know it's not in position 2 in the secret word.

But in our next guess, we can try O in a different position.

We need to avoid the forbidden letters: A, C, E, I, M, N, R, S.

So for ""DOUBT"": D, O, U, B, T. 
- O is in position 2, but we know the secret word doesn't have O in position 2. So if we guess ""DOUBT"", and if the secret word has O, then the O in position 2 would get a '-' (if O is in the word but not in position 2) or 'x' (if O is not in the word at all, but we know it is). But we know O is in the word, so it would be marked as '-' for position 2. But we already know that, so it doesn't give new information? We want to test other positions.

Alternatively, we can try to put O in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let me list possible words:

- Position 1: O _ _ _ T -> e.g., ""OUCHT""? Not a word. ""Ought"" -> but G and H are allowed, but ""ought"" has G and H. But we haven't excluded H or G. ""Ought"" is a word: O, U, G, H, T. But note, we have to check if these letters are allowed. We haven't used U, G, H. So it's okay.

But we have to make sure we don't use excluded letters. Excluded: A, C, E, I, M, N, R, S. So G, H, U are okay.

But ""ought"" has O in position 1 and T in position 5. Also, O is not in position 2, which is consistent.

But we don't know if the word has U, G, H.

Another word: ""OUTPUT""? But P and U, and it's 6 letters? No, 5 letters: ""output"" is 6. 

""OUTPT"" is not a word.

How about ""OCTET""? But O is in position 1? And C is excluded. So no.

""VOLT""? 4 letters.

Let's try position 3: _ _ O _ T -> e.g., ""BLOUT""? Not a word. ""CLOUT""? C is excluded. ""FLOUT""? F, L, O, U, T. F and L are allowed. So ""flout"" is a word.

But we don't know if F and L are in the word.

Another: ""GLOAT""? G, L, O, A, T -> but A is excluded.

""THROB""? T, H, R, O, B -> but R is excluded.

""BROTH""? B, R, O, T, H -> R excluded.

We need to avoid R.

""DOZOT""? Not a word.

Position 4: _ _ _ O T -> e.g., ""BOOST""? But O is in position 2 and 3? And S is excluded. Also, we have two O's? But we don't know if the word has two O's. But in feedback, we only know there's at least one O.

""BLOOT""? Not a word.

""GROUT""? G, R, O, U, T -> R excluded.

""TROUT""? T, R, O, U, T -> R excluded and T in first position? We don't know about T in first.

We have T at the end, but T might appear elsewhere? The feedback for ""moist"" had T at the end correct, but that doesn't say anything about other T's.

But in ""moist"", the T was at the end and correct, but if there were another T, it might have been marked? But we don't have another T in the guess.

So the secret word might have more than one T.

But we don't know.

Let me think of words ending with T, containing O, and without the excluded letters.

Excluded: A, C, E, I, M, N, R, S.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And O must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Possible words:

- Position 1: O....T
  - Ought (O, U, G, H, T) -> valid
  - Outdo (O, U, T, D, O) -> but ends with O? We need T at the end. ""Outdo"" ends with O.
  - Outgo (O, U, T, G, O) -> ends with O.
  - Ovolo? Not common.

- Position 3: ..O.T
  - Blood? But ends with D, not T.
  - Flood? Ends with D.
  - Float? But A excluded.
  - Gloat? A excluded.
  - Bloat? A excluded.
  - Cloth? C excluded.
  - Sloth? S excluded.
  - Ploy? 4 letters.
  - Blunt? U and N excluded (N is excluded from first guess).
  - Flout: F, L, O, U, T -> positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), T(5). So O is in position 3. This is valid.

- Position 4: ...OT
  - Bigot? B, I, G, O, T -> but I is excluded (from second guess, I is absent).
  - Dugout? 6 letters.
  - Try ""PILOT""? P, I, L, O, T -> but I is excluded.
  - ""HOT""? 3 letters.
  - ""JOUST""? J, O, U, S, T -> S excluded.
  - ""MOULT""? M, O, U, L, T -> but M is excluded (from second guess, M absent).
  - ""POULT""? P, O, U, L, T -> P, O, U, L, T. O is in position 2? We need O in position 4? In ""POULT"", O is in position 2. We are looking for position 4. So for position 4: the fourth letter is O and fifth is T.

  Words ending with ""OT"": e.g., ""BOOT"", ""COOT"", ""FOOT"", ""HOOT"", ""LOOT"", ""MOOT"", ""POOT"", ""ROOT"", ""SOOT"", ""TOOT"" -> but many have excluded letters. Also, they are 4 letters? No, they are 4 letters? ""Boot"" is 4 letters? No, 4 letters: B-O-O-T. We need 5 letters.

  Actually, 5-letter words ending with ""OT"" are rare? Or with O in position 4 and T in 5: so the last two letters are ""OT"". But the word must be 5 letters: so pattern: ???OT.

  Examples: 
    ""BEGOT"": B, E, G, O, T -> but E excluded.
    ""BIGOT"": B, I, G, O, T -> I excluded.
    ""DEPOT"": D, E, P, O, T -> E excluded.
    ""PIVOT"": P, I, V, O, T -> I excluded.
    ""VISIT"": V, I, S, I, T -> I and S excluded.

  Not many options.

  How about ""QUOIT""? Q, U, O, I, T -> I excluded.

  ""JOUST"" has S and is 5 letters but S excluded.

  So position 4 for O is difficult.

Therefore, the best bets are words with O in position 1 or 3.

We have:
- ""ought"" (O in position 1)
- ""flout"" (O in position 3)

We also have T at the end, so we can try one of these.

But we want to test O in a new position.

So I think ""ought"" or ""flout"" are good.

Let me choose ""flout"" because it tests F and L, which are common, and U.

So guess: ""flout""

But note: in ""flout"", the T is at the end, which we know is correct, so it will be marked as ✓ for T.

The O is in position 3, which we haven't tested.

So we can see if O is in position 3 or not.

If not, then O must be in position 1 or 4.

But we are guessing O in position 3.

So let's go with ""flout"".
