 Common starting words in such games include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).

After considering common starting words that include a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information, I selected ""CRANE"" as the initial guess. This word uses common letters and provides a balanced distribution to help identify the presence and positions of letters in the secret word.

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter of the secret word)

Therefore, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

Since it's the fifth letter, the secret word ends with E.

Now, we know the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ E

We must avoid using the letters C, A, and N.

We should try to guess a word that fits this pattern and uses other common letters to uncover the remaining letters.

Possible letters for the first, third, and fourth positions. We focus on common consonants and vowels.

Remember: the third and fourth positions are unknown, and the first position is unknown.

We must avoid C, A, N as per feedback.

The word must have R as the second letter and E as the fifth.

Let's think of words that end with E and have R as the second letter.

Examples: 
- PRIDE (P R I D E)
- GRIME (G R I M E)
- BRIDE (B R I D E)
- TRIPE (T R I P E)
- WRITE (W R I T E)

But note that we have limited information about other letters.

We want to maximize information by including letters that are common and not yet tested.

We haven't tested B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

We know E and R are confirmed, but we need to find the other three.

Since E and R are known, we focus on the unknown positions.

We can choose a word that uses new letters to test.

Let us list common letters: E is already used, R is used.

Try including vowels? The word has E at the end, so the others are consonants? Not necessarily, there can be vowels in the middle.

For example, the first letter could be a vowel: URINE? But U R I N E, but N is excluded, so not possible.

We must avoid N.

So let's try PRICE: but C is excluded, since in the first guess C got x.

Similarly, we avoid C.

Another word: BRINE? But N is excluded.

Possible words: 
- TRIBE (T R I B E) -> T, I, B are new.
- GRIPE (G R I P E)
- TRICE? But C is excluded.

Since we have E at the end, another common pattern is words like ""DRIVE"" or ""WRITE"".

But we don't know about D, I, V, W, etc.

We can also consider words that have repeated letters? But no evidence so far.

To cover more ground, we should include a variety of letters.

I propose ""PRIME"": P R I M E

- P: new
- R: known position
- I: new
- M: new
- E: known position

This way, we can test P, I, M.

Another option is ""BRIDE"": B R I D E

But both are similar.

Since we don't know the third and fourth, let's pick one that uses common letters.

I think ""PRIME"" is a reasonable guess.

Let me verify if it is a valid word: yes, PRIME is a valid English word.

Structure: positions: 1: P, 2: R, 3: I, 4: M, 5: E

We'll see if I or M are correct.

But note: in the feedback, A and N are not in the word, but also from the first guess, we had A and N wrong, so we avoid them.

So, let's go with ""PRIME"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word (marked as 'x').
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).

This means the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ E.

For the second guess, I need to test potential letters for the first, third, and fourth positions while avoiding C, A, and N. I chose ""prime"" because:
- It fits the known pattern (_ R _ _ E).
- It introduces new common letters (P, I, M) to gather more information.
- P, I, and M are high-frequency consonants/vowels that could help uncover the full word efficiently.

- C, A, N are not in the secret word.

Guess 2: prime -> P(x), R(✓), I(✓), M(x), E(✓)
- R and E are confirmed again in the same positions (expected since we knew that).
- I is correct and in the correct position. Since I is the third letter in ""prime"", that means the third letter of the secret word is I.
- P and M are not in the secret word.

Now, we know more about the secret word:
- Second letter: R
- Third letter: I
- Fifth letter: E
- First and fourth letters are unknown, but we have constraints.

So the secret word has the form: _ R I _ E

We also know that the following letters are NOT in the word: C, A, N, P, M (from the feedback x).

We need to guess the first and fourth positions.

We have to avoid C, and all letters that have been marked as absent in previous feedback.

We should use new letters to test the possibilities.

Common letters remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But also, note that vowels: we already used A and E, and I is confirmed. O and U are possibilities.

But E is already used at the end, and I is used. So for the other positions, likely consonants but could have vowels if double letters? But not necessarily.

We need to find a word that fits _ R I _ E and avoids C, A, N, P, M.

Possible candidates:
- BRIDE: B R I D E -> B and D are new, but fourth letter D.
- WRITE: W R I T E -> W and T are new.
- TRIPE: T R I P E -> but P is bad, we know P is not in word, so cannot use P.
- FRISE: not common? FRISK is better? But S is possible.
- DRIVE: D R I V E -> D and V new.
- GRIE: not 5 letters.

We have to pick a valid word.

Given the pattern, common words: BRINE would have N, but N is excluded. Similarly, PRICE has C and P excluded.

So BRIDE, WRITE, DRIVE, TRIBE (but TRIBE has B and E? E is at fifth, so TRIBE: T R I B E).

Now, in BRIDE: letters B, R, I, D, E. R and I and E are known to be in, but D is new.

Similarly, WRITE: W, R, I, T, E.

We want to test letters that are likely to be in the word.

But we don't know the first and fourth.

We could choose to test a word that has common letters to see if they are present.

For example, include S or T as they are common.

We haven't tested S, T, B, D, etc.

Another constraint: the fourth letter must be such that when placed, it doesn't conflict.

After some thought, let's list possible words:

Options:
- BRINE: excluded because N is not allowed.
- TRICE: has C, excluded.
This is tricky.

Valid words:
- BRIDE -> B R I D E
- WRITE -> W R I T E
- TRIBE -> T R I B E (but T and B)
- CRIME: C is excluded, not possible.

Another one: GRIME -> G R I M E? But M is excluded because in ""prime"" M was x.

We must avoid M.

Similarly, SHIRE -> S H I R E? But the pattern requires R at second, so SHIRE: S H I R E -> positions: 1-S, 2-H? No, H is second, not R. So no.

The word must have R at index 1 (zero-based index 1) and I at index 2.

So SHIRE is not: S is first, H second -> but our word must have R at second? Indexing: position 1: second letter.

In SHIRE, the letters are: 0:S, 1:H, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E -> but we need position 1 to be R? Here it is H, and R is at position 3. That doesn't match, and R is out of place.

We need the structure: first letter-unknown, second-R, third-I, fourth-unknown, fifth-E.

So:
- First letter: anything allowed, not C,A,N,P,M
- Fourth letter: anything allowed, not C,A,N,P,M
- Fifth: E

So possible words:
- BRIBE: B R I B E -> but double B? Possible, but let's see if real word.
- BRIDE: B R I D E
- WRITE: W R I T E
- DRIVE: D R I V E
- TRITE: T R I T E -> T R I T E? 
- FRIBE: not a word
- GRIBE: not common
- TRIBE: T R I B E
- TRIKE: T R I K E? Not a common word?
- PRISE: P is excluded because P is in x from guess2.

List of common words: BRIDE, WRITE, TRIBE, DRIVE, SHINE but SHINE: S H I N E -> N excluded, and second letter H not R? Not matching pattern.

SHIRE doesn't fit pattern.

Another one: TRIPE but P excluded.

So possible: BRIDE, WRITE, TRIBE, DRIVE.

Now for guess, we want to maximize new information.

We have already tested P and M which are absent.

Now, for BRIDE, letters B,R,I,D,E: R,I,E known, B and D new.

Similarly WRITE: W,R,I,T,E: known R,I,E and new W,T.

TRIBE: T,R,I,B,E: new T,B.

DRIVE: D,R,I,V,E: new D,V.

We can choose any, but we want to cover more letters.

Also, note that the fourth letter could be a vowel? Not necessary.

Since we know three positions, we can solve with one guess? But we have more guesses left.

We don't know the first and fourth.

To test, let's pick one that uses letters we haven't tried.

For example, say we pick ""WRITE"": that would test W and T.

But if we get feedback, then we might know more.

Similarly, if we pick ""BRIDE"", test B and D.

But we have limited guesses.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has letters that might be duplicated? But not evident.

But note, we can use letters we haven't excluded.

Perhaps ""SHIRE"" is not an option because of position.

What about ""GRIDE""? Not common.

""URINE"": not common U R I N E? But N is excluded.

So back to the common words.

Perhaps ""TRICE"" has C.

I think BRIDE or WRITE or DRIVE is fine.

Let me consider the frequency of letters.

In English, common letters for first position: B, D, L, M but M excluded, so B or D or S or T.

Similarly for fourth position, consonants like D, T, N but N excluded, so possible D,T,S,L,etc.

We could use S or T.

But S hasn't been tested.

What words have S? For example, BRISK: B R I S K? That fits pattern: B? R? I? S? K? and ends E? No, BRISK ends with K, but we need E at end.

Not possible.

SHIRE: but position issue.

WRITE has T.

TRIBE has T and B.

But none with S easily.

Another word: ""BRINE"" has N, excluded.

Perhaps we should test S separately.

But we can only test one word.

Therefore, let's choose between ""BRIDE"" and ""WRITE"".

""WRITE"" uses W and T. W is less common, so perhaps better to test B or D.

But D is common.

To avoid wasting letters, perhaps ""DRIVE"" or ""BRIDE"".

I think ""WRITE"" is a good candidate because it uses T which is very common.

Structure: W R I T E

New letters: W and T.

If we get feedback: if W is present or not, similarly T.

Since the pattern must be _ R I _ E, and W is in position 0.

If it is present, then it must be in word? But the first position is unknown.

If W is marked as present but wrong position? Not possible, because we have no duplicate. Or if it is the first letter.

Similarly for T.

But let's guess WRITE.

It's a valid word.

We can also consider ""TRITE"" but it means trite, and same pattern.

I think WRITE is better.

After feedback from guess2, we have confirmed that I is in position 3.

So secret word: ? R I ? E

We excluded some letters.

For next guess, it's okay to try to hit the word.

But with only 6 guesses, we can test letters.

But since we have three confirmed, we might solve.

But we don't know first and fourth.

Words like BRISE? Not common English word.

FRISE? Not common.

Common words: BRIDE, WRITE, TRIBE, DRIVE.

For maximum information, let's choose one that doesn't repeat letters and uses common untested consonants.

I choose ""WRITE"".

WRITE: W R I T E

Then if:
- W is x, then we know W not in word.
- T will be marked based on if it is in the word.

But T is fourth in this guess? Position: 0:W,1:R,2:I,3:T,4:E? E is fifth.

No: indexing: in the word, positions: 0: W, 1: R, 2: I, 3: T, 4: E.

But the secret word has: position 0: unknown, 1: R, 2: I, 3: unknown, 4: E.

So for our guess WRITE:
- Position 0: W vs secret[0]
- Position 1: R vs secret[1] - match
- Position 2: I vs secret[2] - match
- Position 3: T vs secret[3]
- Position 4: E vs secret[4] - match

In WRITE, the R is at index1 (second letter), which matches secret position1.

Similarly I and E match.

So feedback will tell about W and T.

If W is x, then W not in word, and similarly for T.

But if T is marked as -, it means T is in the word but not in position3.

That would imply T is either in position0? But if W is absent, then position0 must be some other letter, and if T is in word, but not position3, then T must be in position0? But position0 is unknown.

Secrete word has only position0 and position3 unknown.

If T is marked as -, then T is in the word but not at position3. Since the only other unknown position is position0, that would mean T must be at position0? But then if W is absent, it's impossible for T to be at position0? Contradiction? Not necessarily, because if T is present elsewhere, but only positions are 0,1,2,3,4. Position1 is R, position2 I, position4 E. So only position0 and position3 could be T.

If T is marked as - meaning it's in the word but at wrong position, and we are guessing it at position3, then the wrong position could only be position0 if it is there. But if T is at position0, it shouldn't be marked as - for the T we guessed at position3? This might be confusing.

Better to see:

If secret word has T at position0, then when we guess WRITE (which has T at position3), the T should be marked as - if it is at position0, because position3 is wrong.

Similarly, if secret has T at position3, then it would be marked correct.

If no T, then x.

Similarly for W: if W at position0, then correct; if elsewhere, but secret only has positions, and W is only guessed at position0.

Similarly, secret pattern has only position0 unknown for the first character.

So if W is marked -, it would mean W is in the word but not position0, but the only other positions: position1 is R, so unless R is W or something, but letters are unique? Not necessarily. But we don't know.

Secret word could have duplicate letters? Possible, but unlikely? We shouldn't assume.

To avoid confusion, perhaps choose a word that doesn't use duplicated letters.

In WRITE, all letters are distinct: W,R,I,T,E.

Similarly, BRIDE: B,R,I,D,E distinct.

DRIVE: D,R,I,V,E distinct.

TRIBE: T,R,I,B,E distinct.

So all good.

Given that we have multiple options, let's pick one.

I think WRITE is fine.

But since we need to make a guess, let's go with WRITE.

So I guess ""write"".
</think>
From the feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""):
  - C is absent (x), so C is not in the word.
  - R is present and in the correct position (✓), confirming the second letter is R.
  - A is absent (x), so A is not in the word.
  - N is absent (x), so N is not in the word.
  - E is present and in the correct position (✓), confirming the fifth letter is E.
  
- Guess 2 (""prime""):
  - P is absent (x), so P is not in the word.
  - R is present and in the correct position (✓), reaffirming the second letter as R.
  - I is present and in the correct position (✓), confirming the third letter is I.
  - M is absent (x), so M is not in the word.
  - E is present and in the correct position (✓), reaffirming the fifth letter as E.

Key deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R I _ E.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, P, M.
- Known letters: R (position 2), I (position 3), E (position 5).
- Missing letters: Position 1 (first letter) and position 4 (fourth letter), which must be chosen from the remaining alphabet, excluding the excluded letters.

Possible candidates for the secret word:
- Words fitting _ R I _ E:
  - BRIDE: B at position 1, D at position 4.
  - WRITE: W at position 1, T at position 4.
  - TRIBE: T at position 1, B at position 4.
  - DRIVE: D at position 1, V at position 4.
  - Other options like BRISK don't fit due to the E ending, or contain excluded letters (e.g., BRINE includes N).

Goal for this guess:
- Test new high-frequency letters to identify position 1 and 4.
- WRITE tests W (position 1) and T (position 4), both common and untested.
- If WRITE gets:
  - W marked ✓/-/x: Reveals if W is in the word and position.
  - T marked ✓/-/x: Reveals if T is in the word and position.

WRITE is chosen because:
- It uses new letters (W, T) to maximize information gain.
- It avoids duplicates and excluded letters.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>write</guess>",write,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
- So, R is the second letter and E is the fifth letter.
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.

Guess 2: prime -> P(x), R(✓), I(✓), M(x), E(✓)
- R and E are confirmed again in the same positions (expected since we knew that).
- I is correct and in the correct position. Since I is the third letter in ""prime"", that means the third letter of the secret word is I.
- P and M are not in the secret word.

Now, we know more about the secret word:
- Second letter: R
- Third letter: I
- Fifth letter: E
- First and fourth letters are unknown, but we have constraints.

So the secret word has the form: _ R I _ E

We also know that the following letters are NOT in the word: C, A, N, P, M (from the feedback x).

We need to guess the first and fourth positions.

We have to avoid C, and all letters that have been marked as absent in previous feedback.

We should use new letters to test the possibilities.

Common letters remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But also, note that vowels: we already used A and E, and I is confirmed. O and U are possibilities.

But E is already used at the end, and I is used. So for the other positions, likely consonants but could have vowels if double letters? But not necessarily.

We need to find a word that fits _ R I _ E and avoids C, A, N, P, M.

Possible candidates:
- BRIDE: B R I D E -> B and D are new, but fourth letter D.
- WRITE: W R I T E -> W and T are new.
- TRIPE: T R I P E -> but P is bad, we know P is not in word, so cannot use P.
- FRISE: not common? FRISK is better? But S is possible.
- DRIVE: D R I V E -> D and V new.
- GRIE: not 5 letters.

We have to pick a valid word.

Given the pattern, common words: BRINE would have N, but N is excluded. Similarly, PRICE has C and P excluded.

So BRIDE, WRITE, DRIVE, TRIBE (but TRIBE has B and E? E is at fifth, so TRIBE: T R I B E).

Now, in BRIDE: letters B, R, I, D, E. R and I and E are known to be in, but D is new.

Similarly, WRITE: W, R, I, T, E.

We want to test letters that are likely to be in the word.

But we don't know the first and fourth.

We could choose to test a word that has common letters to see if they are present.

For example, include S or T as they are common.

We haven't tested S, T, B, D, etc.

Another constraint: the fourth letter must be such that when placed, it doesn't conflict.

After some thought, let's list possible words:

Options:
- BRINE: excluded because N is not allowed.
- TRICE: has C, excluded.
This is tricky.

Valid words:
- BRIDE -> B R I D E
- WRITE -> W R I T E
- TRIBE -> T R I B E (but T and B)
- CRIME: C is excluded, not possible.

Another one: GRIME -> G R I M E? But M is excluded because in ""prime"" M was x.

We must avoid M.

Similarly, SHIRE -> S H I R E? But the pattern requires R at second, so SHIRE: S H I R E -> positions: 1-S, 2-H? No, H is second, not R. So no.

The word must have R at index 1 (zero-based index 1) and I at index 2.

So SHIRE is not: S is first, H second -> but our word must have R at second? Indexing: position 1: second letter.

In SHIRE, the letters are: 0:S, 1:H, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E -> but we need position 1 to be R? Here it is H, and R is at position 3. That doesn't match, and R is out of place.

We need the structure: first letter-unknown, second-R, third-I, fourth-unknown, fifth-E.

So:
- First letter: anything allowed, not C,A,N,P,M
- Fourth letter: anything allowed, not C,A,N,P,M
- Fifth: E

So possible words:
- BRIBE: B R I B E -> but double B? Possible, but let's see if real word.
- BRIDE: B R I D E
- WRITE: W R I T E
- DRIVE: D R I V E
- TRITE: T R I T E -> T R I T E? 
- FRIBE: not a word
- GRIBE: not common
- TRIBE: T R I B E
- TRIKE: T R I K E? Not a common word?
- PRISE: P is excluded because P is in x from guess2.

List of common words: BRIDE, WRITE, TRIBE, DRIVE, SHINE but SHINE: S H I N E -> N excluded, and second letter H not R? Not matching pattern.

SHIRE doesn't fit pattern.

Another one: TRIPE but P excluded.

So possible: BRIDE, WRITE, TRIBE, DRIVE.

Now for guess, we want to maximize new information.

We have already tested P and M which are absent.

Now, for BRIDE, letters B,R,I,D,E: R,I,E known, B and D new.

Similarly WRITE: W,R,I,T,E: known R,I,E and new W,T.

TRIBE: T,R,I,B,E: new T,B.

DRIVE: D,R,I,V,E: new D,V.

We can choose any, but we want to cover more letters.

Also, note that the fourth letter could be a vowel? Not necessary.

Since we know three positions, we can solve with one guess? But we have more guesses left.

We don't know the first and fourth.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has letters that might be duplicated? But not evident.

But note, we can use letters we haven't excluded.

Perhaps ""SHIRE"" is not an option because of position.

What about ""GRIDE""? Not common.

""URINE"": not common U R I N E? But N is excluded.

So back to the common words.

Perhaps ""TRICE"" has C.

I think BRIDE or WRITE or DRIVE is fine.

Let me consider the frequency of letters.

In English, common letters for first position: B, D, L, M but M excluded, so B or D or S or T.

Similarly for fourth position, consonants like D, T, N but N excluded, so possible D,T,S,L,etc.

We could use S or T.

But S hasn't been tested.

What words have S? For example, BRISK: B R I S K? That fits pattern: B? R? I? S? K? and ends E? No, BRISK ends with K, but we need E at end.

Not possible.

SHIRE: but position issue.

WRITE has T.

TRIBE has T and B.

But none with S easily.

Another word: ""BRINE"" has N, excluded.

Perhaps we should test S separately.

But we can only test one word.

Therefore, let's choose between ""BRIDE"" and ""WRITE"".

""WRITE"" uses W and T. W is less common, so perhaps better to test B or D.

But D is common.

To avoid wasting letters, perhaps ""DRIVE"" or ""BRIDE"".

I think ""WRITE"" is a good candidate because it uses T which is very common.

Structure: W R I T E

New letters: W and T.

If we get feedback: if W is present or not, similarly T.

Since the pattern must be _ R I _ E, and W is in position 0.

If it is present, then it must be in word? But the first position is unknown.

If W is marked as present but wrong position? Not possible, because we have no duplicate. Or if it is the first letter.

Similarly for T.

But let's guess WRITE.

It's a valid word.

We can also consider ""TRITE"" but it means trite, and same pattern.

I think WRITE is better.

After feedback from guess2, we have confirmed that I is in position 3.

So secret word: ? R I ? E

We excluded some letters.

For next guess, it's okay to try to hit the word.

But with only 6 guesses, we can test letters.

But since we have three confirmed, we might solve.

But we don't know first and fourth.

Words like BRISE? Not common English word.

FRISE? Not common.

Common words: BRIDE, WRITE, TRIBE, DRIVE.

For maximum information, let's choose one that doesn't repeat letters and uses common untested consonants.

I choose ""WRITE"".

WRITE: W R I T E

Then if:
- W is x, then we know W not in word.
- T will be marked based on if it is in the word.

But T is fourth in this guess? Position: 0:W,1:R,2:I,3:T,4:E? E is fifth.

No: indexing: in the word, positions: 0: W, 1: R, 2: I, 3: T, 4: E.

But the secret word has: position 0: unknown, 1: R, 2: I, 3: unknown, 4: E.

So for our guess WRITE:
- Position 0: W vs secret[0]
- Position 1: R vs secret[1] - match
- Position 2: I vs secret[2] - match
- Position 3: T vs secret[3]
- Position 4: E vs secret[4] - match

In WRITE, the R is at index1 (second letter), which matches secret position1.

Similarly I and E match.

So feedback will tell about W and T.

If W is x, then W not in word, and similarly for T.

But if T is marked as -, it means T is in the word but not in position3.

That would imply T is either in position0? But if W is absent, then position0 must be some other letter, and if T is in word, but not position3, then T must be in position0? But position0 is unknown.

Secrete word has only position0 and position3 unknown.

If T is marked as -, then T is in the word but not at position3. Since the only other unknown position is position0, that would mean T must be at position0? But then if W is absent, it's impossible for T to be at position0? Contradiction? Not necessarily, because if T is present elsewhere, but only positions are 0,1,2,3,4. Position1 is R, position2 I, position4 E. So only position0 and position3 could be T.

If T is marked as - meaning it's in the word but at wrong position, and we are guessing it at position3, then the wrong position could only be position0 if it is there. But if T is at position0, it shouldn't be marked as - for the T we guessed at position3? This might be confusing.

Better to see:

If secret word has T at position0, then when we guess WRITE (which has T at position3), the T should be marked as - if it is at position0, because position3 is wrong.

Similarly, if secret has T at position3, then it would be marked correct.

If no T, then x.

Similarly for W: if W at position0, then correct; if elsewhere, but secret only has positions, and W is only guessed at position0.

Similarly, secret pattern has only position0 unknown for the first character.

So if W is marked -, it would mean W is in the word but not position0, but the only other positions: position1 is R, so unless R is W or something, but letters are unique? Not necessarily. But we don't know.

Secret word could have duplicate letters? Possible, but unlikely? We shouldn't assume.

To avoid confusion, perhaps choose a word that doesn't use duplicated letters.

In WRITE, all letters are distinct: W,R,I,T,E.

Similarly, BRIDE: B,R,I,D,E distinct.

DRIVE: D,R,I,V,E distinct.

TRIBE: T,R,I,B,E distinct.

So all good.

Given that we have multiple options, let's pick one.

I think WRITE is fine.

But since we need to make a guess, let's go with WRITE.

So I guess ""write"".From the feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""):

  - P is absent (x), so P is not in the word.
  - R is present and in the correct position (✓), reaffirming the second letter as R.
  - I is present and in the correct position (✓), confirming the third letter is I.
  - M is absent (x), so M is not in the word.
  - E is present and in the correct position (✓), reaffirming the fifth letter as E.

Key deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R I _ E.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, P, M.
- Known letters: R (position 2), I (position 3), E (position 5).
- Missing letters: Position 1 (first letter) and position 4 (fourth letter), which must be chosen from the remaining alphabet, excluding the excluded letters.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We have no information to start with, so we'll pick a word that has common letters and a balanced vowel-consonant ratio.
 Common starting words in such games include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E).After considering common starting words that include a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information, I selected ""CRANE"" as the initial guess. This word uses common letters and provides a balanced distribution to help identify the presence and positions of letters in the secret word.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter of the secret word)

Therefore, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

Since it's the fifth letter, the secret word ends with E.

Now, we know the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ E

We must avoid using the letters C, A, and N.

We should try to guess a word that fits this pattern and uses other common letters to uncover the remaining letters.

Possible letters for the first, third, and fourth positions. We focus on common consonants and vowels.

Remember: the third and fourth positions are unknown, and the first position is unknown.

We must avoid C, A, N as per feedback.

The word must have R as the second letter and E as the fifth.

Let's think of words that end with E and have R as the second letter.

Examples: 
- PRIDE (P R I D E)
- GRIME (G R I M E)
- BRIDE (B R I D E)
- TRIPE (T R I P E)
- WRITE (W R I T E)

But note that we have limited information about other letters.

We want to maximize information by including letters that are common and not yet tested.

We haven't tested B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

We know E and R are confirmed, but we need to find the other three.

Since E and R are known, we focus on the unknown positions.

We can choose a word that uses new letters to test.

Let us list common letters: E is already used, R is used.

Try including vowels? The word has E at the end, so the others are consonants? Not necessarily, there can be vowels in the middle.

For example, the first letter could be a vowel: URINE? But U R I N E, but N is excluded, so not possible.

We must avoid N.

So let's try PRICE: but C is excluded, since in the first guess C got x.

Similarly, we avoid C.

Another word: BRINE? But N is excluded.

Possible words: 
- TRIBE (T R I B E) -> T, I, B are new.
- GRIPE (G R I P E)
- TRICE? But C is excluded.

Since we have E at the end, another common pattern is words like ""DRIVE"" or ""WRITE"".

But we don't know about D, I, V, W, etc.

We can also consider words that have repeated letters? But no evidence so far.

To cover more ground, we should include a variety of letters.

I propose ""PRIME"": P R I M E

- P: new
- R: known position
- I: new
- M: new
- E: known position

This way, we can test P, I, M.

Another option is ""BRIDE"": B R I D E

But both are similar.

Since we don't know the third and fourth, let's pick one that uses common letters.

I think ""PRIME"" is a reasonable guess.

Let me verify if it is a valid word: yes, PRIME is a valid English word.

Structure: positions: 1: P, 2: R, 3: I, 4: M, 5: E

We'll see if I or M are correct.

But note: in the feedback, A and N are not in the word, but also from the first guess, we had A and N wrong, so we avoid them.

So, let's go with ""PRIME"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word (marked as 'x').
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).

This means the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ E.

For the second guess, I need to test potential letters for the first, third, and fourth positions while avoiding C, A, and N. I chose ""prime"" because:
- It fits the known pattern (_ R _ _ E).
- It introduces new common letters (P, I, M) to gather more information.
- P, I, and M are high-frequency consonants/vowels that could help uncover the full word efficiently.

<guess>prime</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: prime -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
- So, R is the second letter and E is the fifth letter.
- C, A, N are not in the secret word.

Guess 2: prime -> P(x), R(✓), I(✓), M(x), E(✓)
- R and E are confirmed again in the same positions (expected since we knew that).
- I is correct and in the correct position. Since I is the third letter in ""prime"", that means the third letter of the secret word is I.
- P and M are not in the secret word.

Now, we know more about the secret word:
- Second letter: R
- Third letter: I
- Fifth letter: E
- First and fourth letters are unknown, but we have constraints.

So the secret word has the form: _ R I _ E

We also know that the following letters are NOT in the word: C, A, N, P, M (from the feedback x).

We need to guess the first and fourth positions.

We have to avoid C, and all letters that have been marked as absent in previous feedback.

We should use new letters to test the possibilities.

Common letters remaining: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But also, note that vowels: we already used A and E, and I is confirmed. O and U are possibilities.

But E is already used at the end, and I is used. So for the other positions, likely consonants but could have vowels if double letters? But not necessarily.

We need to find a word that fits _ R I _ E and avoids C, A, N, P, M.

Possible candidates:
- BRIDE: B R I D E -> B and D are new, but fourth letter D.
- WRITE: W R I T E -> W and T are new.
- TRIPE: T R I P E -> but P is bad, we know P is not in word, so cannot use P.
- FRISE: not common? FRISK is better? But S is possible.
- DRIVE: D R I V E -> D and V new.
- GRIE: not 5 letters.

We have to pick a valid word.

Given the pattern, common words: BRINE would have N, but N is excluded. Similarly, PRICE has C and P excluded.

So BRIDE, WRITE, DRIVE, TRIBE (but TRIBE has B and E? E is at fifth, so TRIBE: T R I B E).

Now, in BRIDE: letters B, R, I, D, E. R and I and E are known to be in, but D is new.

Similarly, WRITE: W, R, I, T, E.

We want to test letters that are likely to be in the word.

But we don't know the first and fourth.

We could choose to test a word that has common letters to see if they are present.

For example, include S or T as they are common.

We haven't tested S, T, B, D, etc.

Another constraint: the fourth letter must be such that when placed, it doesn't conflict.

After some thought, let's list possible words:

Options:
- BRINE: excluded because N is not allowed.
- TRICE: has C, excluded.
This is tricky.

Valid words:
- BRIDE -> B R I D E
- WRITE -> W R I T E
- TRIBE -> T R I B E (but T and B)
- CRIME: C is excluded, not possible.

Another one: GRIME -> G R I M E? But M is excluded because in ""prime"" M was x.

We must avoid M.

Similarly, SHIRE -> S H I R E? But the pattern requires R at second, so SHIRE: S H I R E -> positions: 1-S, 2-H? No, H is second, not R. So no.

The word must have R at index 1 (zero-based index 1) and I at index 2.

So SHIRE is not: S is first, H second -> but our word must have R at second? Indexing: position 1: second letter.

In SHIRE, the letters are: 0:S, 1:H, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E -> but we need position 1 to be R? Here it is H, and R is at position 3. That doesn't match, and R is out of place.

We need the structure: first letter-unknown, second-R, third-I, fourth-unknown, fifth-E.

So:
- First letter: anything allowed, not C,A,N,P,M
- Fourth letter: anything allowed, not C,A,N,P,M
- Fifth: E

So possible words:
- BRIBE: B R I B E -> but double B? Possible, but let's see if real word.
- BRIDE: B R I D E
- WRITE: W R I T E
- DRIVE: D R I V E
- TRITE: T R I T E -> T R I T E? 
- FRIBE: not a word
- GRIBE: not common
- TRIBE: T R I B E
- TRIKE: T R I K E? Not a common word?
- PRISE: P is excluded because P is in x from guess2.

List of common words: BRIDE, WRITE, TRIBE, DRIVE, SHINE but SHINE: S H I N E -> N excluded, and second letter H not R? Not matching pattern.

SHIRE doesn't fit pattern.

Another one: TRIPE but P excluded.

So possible: BRIDE, WRITE, TRIBE, DRIVE.

Now for guess, we want to maximize new information.

We have already tested P and M which are absent.

Now, for BRIDE, letters B,R,I,D,E: R,I,E known, B and D new.

Similarly WRITE: W,R,I,T,E: known R,I,E and new W,T.

TRIBE: T,R,I,B,E: new T,B.

DRIVE: D,R,I,V,E: new D,V.

We can choose any, but we want to cover more letters.

Also, note that the fourth letter could be a vowel? Not necessary.

Since we know three positions, we can solve with one guess? But we have more guesses left.

We don't know the first and fourth.

To test, let's pick one that uses letters we haven't tried.

For example, say we pick ""WRITE"": that would test W and T.

But if we get feedback, then we might know more.

Similarly, if we pick ""BRIDE"", test B and D.

But we have limited guesses.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has letters that might be duplicated? But not evident.

But note, we can use letters we haven't excluded.

Perhaps ""SHIRE"" is not an option because of position.

What about ""GRIDE""? Not common.

""URINE"": not common U R I N E? But N is excluded.

So back to the common words.

Perhaps ""TRICE"" has C.

I think BRIDE or WRITE or DRIVE is fine.

Let me consider the frequency of letters.

In English, common letters for first position: B, D, L, M but M excluded, so B or D or S or T.

Similarly for fourth position, consonants like D, T, N but N excluded, so possible D,T,S,L,etc.

We could use S or T.

But S hasn't been tested.

What words have S? For example, BRISK: B R I S K? That fits pattern: B? R? I? S? K? and ends E? No, BRISK ends with K, but we need E at end.

Not possible.

SHIRE: but position issue.

WRITE has T.

TRIBE has T and B.

But none with S easily.

Another word: ""BRINE"" has N, excluded.

Perhaps we should test S separately.

But we can only test one word.

Therefore, let's choose between ""BRIDE"" and ""WRITE"".

""WRITE"" uses W and T. W is less common, so perhaps better to test B or D.

But D is common.

To avoid wasting letters, perhaps ""DRIVE"" or ""BRIDE"".

I think ""WRITE"" is a good candidate because it uses T which is very common.

Structure: W R I T E

New letters: W and T.

If we get feedback: if W is present or not, similarly T.

Since the pattern must be _ R I _ E, and W is in position 0.

If it is present, then it must be in word? But the first position is unknown.

If W is marked as present but wrong position? Not possible, because we have no duplicate. Or if it is the first letter.

Similarly for T.

But let's guess WRITE.

It's a valid word.

We can also consider ""TRITE"" but it means trite, and same pattern.

I think WRITE is better.

After feedback from guess2, we have confirmed that I is in position 3.

So secret word: ? R I ? E

We excluded some letters.

For next guess, it's okay to try to hit the word.

But with only 6 guesses, we can test letters.

But since we have three confirmed, we might solve.

But we don't know first and fourth.

Words like BRISE? Not common English word.

FRISE? Not common.

Common words: BRIDE, WRITE, TRIBE, DRIVE.

For maximum information, let's choose one that doesn't repeat letters and uses common untested consonants.

I choose ""WRITE"".

WRITE: W R I T E

Then if:
- W is x, then we know W not in word.
- T will be marked based on if it is in the word.

But T is fourth in this guess? Position: 0:W,1:R,2:I,3:T,4:E? E is fifth.

No: indexing: in the word, positions: 0: W, 1: R, 2: I, 3: T, 4: E.

But the secret word has: position 0: unknown, 1: R, 2: I, 3: unknown, 4: E.

So for our guess WRITE:
- Position 0: W vs secret[0]
- Position 1: R vs secret[1] - match
- Position 2: I vs secret[2] - match
- Position 3: T vs secret[3]
- Position 4: E vs secret[4] - match

In WRITE, the R is at index1 (second letter), which matches secret position1.

Similarly I and E match.

So feedback will tell about W and T.

If W is x, then W not in word, and similarly for T.

But if T is marked as -, it means T is in the word but not in position3.

That would imply T is either in position0? But if W is absent, then position0 must be some other letter, and if T is in word, but not position3, then T must be in position0? But position0 is unknown.

Secrete word has only position0 and position3 unknown.

If T is marked as -, then T is in the word but not at position3. Since the only other unknown position is position0, that would mean T must be at position0? But then if W is absent, it's impossible for T to be at position0? Contradiction? Not necessarily, because if T is present elsewhere, but only positions are 0,1,2,3,4. Position1 is R, position2 I, position4 E. So only position0 and position3 could be T.

If T is marked as - meaning it's in the word but at wrong position, and we are guessing it at position3, then the wrong position could only be position0 if it is there. But if T is at position0, it shouldn't be marked as - for the T we guessed at position3? This might be confusing.

Better to see:

If secret word has T at position0, then when we guess WRITE (which has T at position3), the T should be marked as - if it is at position0, because position3 is wrong.

Similarly, if secret has T at position3, then it would be marked correct.

If no T, then x.

Similarly for W: if W at position0, then correct; if elsewhere, but secret only has positions, and W is only guessed at position0.

Similarly, secret pattern has only position0 unknown for the first character.

So if W is marked -, it would mean W is in the word but not position0, but the only other positions: position1 is R, so unless R is W or something, but letters are unique? Not necessarily. But we don't know.

Secret word could have duplicate letters? Possible, but unlikely? We shouldn't assume.

To avoid confusion, perhaps choose a word that doesn't use duplicated letters.

In WRITE, all letters are distinct: W,R,I,T,E.

Similarly, BRIDE: B,R,I,D,E distinct.

DRIVE: D,R,I,V,E distinct.

TRIBE: T,R,I,B,E distinct.

So all good.

Given that we have multiple options, let's pick one.

I think WRITE is fine.

But since we need to make a guess, let's go with WRITE.

So I guess ""write"".From the feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""):
  - C is absent (x), so C is not in the word.
  - R is present and in the correct position (✓), confirming the second letter is R.
  - A is absent (x), so A is not in the word.
  - N is absent (x), so N is not in the word.
  - E is present and in the correct position (✓), confirming the fifth letter is E.
  
- Guess 2 (""prime""):
  - P is absent (x), so P is not in the word.
  - R is present and in the correct position (✓), reaffirming the second letter as R.
  - I is present and in the correct position (✓), confirming the third letter is I.
  - M is absent (x), so M is not in the word.
  - E is present and in the correct position (✓), reaffirming the fifth letter as E.

Key deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R I _ E.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, P, M.
- Known letters: R (position 2), I (position 3), E (position 5).
- Missing letters: Position 1 (first letter) and position 4 (fourth letter), which must be chosen from the remaining alphabet, excluding the excluded letters.

Possible candidates for the secret word:
- Words fitting _ R I _ E:
  - BRIDE: B at position 1, D at position 4.
  - WRITE: W at position 1, T at position 4.
  - TRIBE: T at position 1, B at position 4.
  - DRIVE: D at position 1, V at position 4.
  - Other options like BRISK don't fit due to the E ending, or contain excluded letters (e.g., BRINE includes N).

Goal for this guess:
- Test new high-frequency letters to identify position 1 and 4.
- WRITE tests W (position 1) and T (position 4), both common and untested.
- If WRITE gets:
  - W marked ✓/-/x: Reveals if W is in the word and position.
  - T marked ✓/-/x: Reveals if T is in the word and position.

WRITE is chosen because:
- It uses new letters (W, T) to maximize information gain.
- It avoids duplicates and excluded letters.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

R and I and E are known to be in, but D is new.\n\nSimilarly, WRITE: W, R, I, T, E.\n\nWe want to test letters that are likely to be in the word.\n\nBut we don\'t know the first and fourth.\n\nWe could choose to test a word that has common letters to see if they are present.\n\nFor example, include S or T as they are common.\n\nWe haven\'t tested S, T, B, D, etc.\n\nAnother constraint: the fourth letter must be such that when placed, it doesn\'t conflict.\n\nAfter some thought, let\'s list possible words:\n\nOptions:\n- BRINE: excluded because N is not allowed.\n- TRICE: has C, excluded.\nThis is tricky.\n\nValid words:\n- BRIDE -> B R I D E\n- WRITE -> W R I T E\n- TRIBE -> T R I B E (but T and B)\n- CRIME: C is excluded, not possible.\n\nAnother one: GRIME -> G R I M E? But M is excluded because in ""prime"" M was x.\n\nWe must avoid M.\n\nSimilarly, SHIRE -> S H I R E? But the pattern requires R at second, so SHIRE: S H I R E -> positions: 1-S, 2-H? No, H is second, not R. So no.\n\nThe word must have R at index 1 (zero-based index 1) and I at index 2.\n\nSo SHIRE is not: S is first, H second -> but our word must have R at second? Indexing: position 1: second letter.\n\nIn SHIRE, the letters are: 0:S, 1:H, 2:I, 3:R, 4:E -> but we need position 1 to be R? Here it is H, and R is at position 3. That doesn\'t match, and R is out of place.\n\nWe need the structure: first letter-unknown, second-R, third-I, fourth-unknown, fifth-E.\n\nSo:\n- First letter: anything allowed, not C,A,N,P,M\n- Fourth letter: anything allowed, not C,A,N,P,M\n- Fifth: E\n\nSo possible words:\n- BRIBE: B R I B E -> but double B? Possible, but let\'s see if real word.\n- BRIDE: B R I D E\n- WRITE: W R I T E\n- DRIVE: D R I V E\n- TRITE: T R I T E -> T R I T E? \n- FRIBE: not a word\n- GRIBE: not common\n- TRIBE: T R I B E\n- TRIKE: T R I K E? Not a common word?\n- PRISE: P is excluded because P is in x from guess2.\n\nList of common words: BRIDE, WRITE, TRIBE, DRIVE, SHINE but SHINE: S H I N E -> N excluded, and second letter H not R? Not matching pattern.\n\nSHIRE doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\nAnother one: TRIPE but P excluded.\n\nSo possible: BRIDE, WRITE, TRIBE, DRIVE.\n\nNow for guess, we want to maximize new information.\n\nWe have already tested P and M which are absent.\n\nNow, for BRIDE, letters B,R,I,D,E: R,I,E known, B and D new.\n\nSimilarly WRITE: W,R,I,T,E: known R,I,E and new W,T.\n\nTRIBE: T,R,I,B,E: new T,B.\n\nDRIVE: D,R,I,V,E: new D,V.\n\nWe can choose any, but we want to cover more letters.\n\nAlso, note that the fourth letter could be a vowel? Not necessary.\n\nSince we know three positions, we can solve with one guess? But we have more guesses left.\n\nWe don\'t know the first and fourth.\n\nTo test, let\'s pick one that uses letters we haven\'t tried.\n\nFor example, say we pick ""WRITE"": that would test W and T.\n\nBut if we get feedback, then we might know more.\n\nSimilarly, if we pick ""BRIDE"", test B and D.\n\nBut we have limited guesses.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has letters that might be duplicated? But not evident.\n\nBut note, we can use letters we haven\'t excluded.\n\nPerhaps ""SHIRE"" is not an option because of position.\n\nWhat about ""GRIDE""? Not common.\n\n""URINE"": not common U R I N E? But N is excluded.\n\nSo back to the common words.\n\nPerhaps ""TRICE"" has C.\n\nI think BRIDE or WRITE or DRIVE is fine.\n\nLet me consider the frequency of letters.\n\nIn English, common letters for first position: B, D, L, M but M excluded, so B or D or S or T.\n\nSimilarly for fourth position, consonants like D, T, N but N excluded, so possible D,T,S,L,etc.\n\nWe could use S or T.\n\nBut S hasn\'t been tested.\n\nWhat words have S? For example, BRISK: B R I S K? That fits pattern: B? R? I? S? K? and ends E? No, BRISK ends with K, but we need E at end.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSHIRE: but position issue.\n\nWRITE has T.\n\nTRIBE has T and B.\n\nBut none with S easily.\n\nAnother word: ""BRINE"" has N, excluded.\n\nPerhaps we should test S separately.\n\nBut we can only test one word.\n\nTherefore, let\'s choose between ""BRIDE"" and ""WRITE"".\n\n""WRITE"" uses W and T. W is less common, so perhaps better to test B or D.\n\nBut D is common.\n\nTo avoid wasting letters, perhaps ""DRIVE"" or ""BRIDE"".\n\nI think ""WRITE"" is a good candidate because it uses T which is very common.\n\nStructure: W R I T E\n\nNew letters: W and T.\n\nIf we get feedback: if W is present or not, similarly T.\n\nSince the pattern must be _ R I _ E, and W is in position 0.\n\nIf it is present, then it must be in word? But the first position is unknown.\n\nIf W is marked as present but wrong position? Not possible, because we have no duplicate. Or if it is the first letter.\n\nSimilarly for T.\n\nBut let\'s guess WRITE.\n\nIt\'s a valid word.\n\nWe can also consider ""TRITE"" but it means trite, and same pattern.\n\nI think WRITE is better.\n\nAfter feedback from guess2, we have confirmed that I is in position 3.\n\nSo secret word: ? R I ? E\n\nWe excluded some letters.\n\nFor next guess, it\'s okay to try to hit the word.\n\nBut with only 6 guesses, we can test letters.\n\nBut since we have three confirmed, we might solve.\n\nBut we don\'t know first and fourth.\n\nWords like BRISE? Not common English word.\n\nFRISE? Not common.\n\nCommon words: BRIDE, WRITE, TRIBE, DRIVE.\n\nFor maximum information, let\'s choose one that doesn\'t repeat letters and uses common untested consonants.\n\nI choose ""WRITE"".\n\nWRITE: W R I T E\n\nThen if:\n- W is x, then we know W not in word.\n- T will be marked based on if it is in the word.\n\nBut T is fourth in this guess? Position: 0:W,1:R,2:I,3:T,4:E? E is fifth.\n\nNo: indexing: in the word, positions: 0: W, 1: R, 2: I, 3: T, 4: E.\n\nBut the secret word has: position 0: unknown, 1: R, 2: I, 3: unknown, 4: E.\n\nSo for our guess WRITE:\n- Position 0: W vs secret[0]\n- Position 1: R vs secret[1] - match\n- Position 2: I vs secret[2] - match\n- Position 3: T vs secret[3]\n- Position 4: E vs secret[4] - match\n\nIn WRITE, the R is at index1 (second letter), which matches secret position1.\n\nSimilarly I and E match.\n\nSo feedback will tell about W and T.\n\nIf W is x, then W not in word, and similarly for T.\n\nBut if T is marked as -, it means T is in the word but not in position3.\n\nThat would imply T is either in position0? But if W is absent, then position0 must be some other letter, and if T is in word, but not position3, then T must be in position0? But position0 is unknown.\n\nSecrete word has only position0 and position3 unknown.\n\nIf T is marked as -, then T is in the word but not at position3. Since the only other unknown position is position0, that would mean T must be at position0? But then if W is absent, it\'s impossible for T to be at position0? Contradiction? Not necessarily, because if T is present elsewhere, but only positions are 0,1,2,3,4. Position1 is R, position2 I, position4 E. So only position0 and position3 could be T.\n\nIf T is marked as - meaning it\'s in the word but at wrong position, and we are guessing it at position3, then the wrong position could only be position0 if it is there. But if T is at position0, it shouldn\'t be marked as - for the T we guessed at position3? This might be confusing.\n\nBetter to see:\n\nIf secret word has T at position0, then when we guess WRITE (which has T at position3), the T should be marked as - if it is at position0, because position3 is wrong.\n\nSimilarly, if secret has T at position3, then it would be marked correct.\n\nIf no T, then x.\n\nSimilarly for W: if W at position0, then correct; if elsewhere, but secret only has positions, and W is only guessed at position0.\n\nSimilarly, secret pattern has only position0 unknown for the first character.\n\nSo if W is marked -, it would mean W is in the word but not position0, but the only other positions: position1 is R, so unless R is W or something, but letters are unique? Not necessarily. But we don\'t know.\n\nSecret word could have duplicate letters? Possible, but unlikely? We shouldn\'t assume.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps choose a word that doesn\'t use duplicated letters.\n\nIn WRITE, all letters are distinct: W,R,I,T,E.\n\nSimilarly, BRIDE: B,R,I,D,E distinct.\n\nDRIVE: D,R,I,V,E distinct.\n\nTRIBE: T,R,I,B,E distinct.\n\nSo all good.\n\nGiven that we have multiple options, let\'s pick one.\n\nI think WRITE is fine.\n\nBut since we need to make a guess, let\'s go with WRITE.\n\nSo I guess ""write"".From the feedback:\n- Guess 1 (""crane""):\n  - C is absent (x), so C is not in the word.\n  - R is present and in the correct position (✓), confirming the second letter is R.\n  - A is absent (x), so A is not in the word.\n  - N is absent (x), so N is not in the word.\n  - E is present and in the correct position (✓), confirming the fifth letter is E.\n  \n- Guess 2 (""prime""):\n  - P is absent (x), so P is not in the word.\n  - R is present and in the correct position (✓), reaffirming the second letter as R.\n  - I is present and in the correct position (✓), confirming the third letter is I.\n  - M is absent (x), so M is not in the word.\n  - E is present and in the correct position (✓), reaffirming the fifth letter as E.\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word has the pattern: _ R I _ E.\n- Excluded letters: C, A, N, P, M.\n- Known letters: R (position 2), I (position 3), E (position 5).\n- Missing letters: Position 1 (first letter) and position 4 (fourth letter), which must be chosen from the remaining alphabet, excluding the excluded letters.\n\nPossible candidates for the secret word:\n- Words fitting _ R I _ E:\n  - BRIDE: B at position 1, D at position 4.\n  - WRITE: W at position 1, T at position 4.\n  - TRIBE: T at position 1, B at position 4.\n  - DRIVE: D at position 1, V at position 4.\n  - Other options like BRISK don\'t fit due to the E ending, or contain excluded letters (e.g., BRINE includes N).\n\nGoal for this guess:\n- Test new high-frequency letters to identify position 1 and 4.\n- WRITE tests W (position 1) and T (position 4), both common and untested.\n- If WRITE gets:\n  - W marked ✓/-/x: Reveals if W is in the word and position.\n  - T marked ✓/-/x: Reveals if T is in the word and position.\n\nWRITE is chosen because:\n- It uses new letters (W, T) to maximize information gain.\n- It avoids duplicates and excluded letters.\n- It is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>write</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: prime -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: write -> FEEDBACK: W(x) R(✓) I(✓) T(-) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from Guess 3: write -> W(x) R(✓) I(✓) T(-) E(✓)

Breaking down the feedback for ""write"":
- W is absent (x) → W is not in the secret word.
- R is present and correct (✓) at position 2 → confirms secret[2] = 'R' (already known).
- I is present and correct (✓) at position 3 → confirms secret[3] = 'I' (already known).
- T is present but not in the correct position (-) → T is in the secret word, but not at position 4. Since we guessed T at position 4 (the fourth letter), and it's marked as ""-"", T must be in the secret word but at a different position.
- E is present and correct (✓) at position 5 → confirms secret[5] = 'E'.

Combined previous feedback:
- Known pattern: _ R I _ E
- Confirmed letters: R (pos2), I (pos3), E (pos5)
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, P, M, W (from x's)
- T is present in the word (from ""-"" in guess3) but not at position 4. Since T is not at position 4, and positions 2 and 3 are taken by R and I, respectively, and position 5 is E, T must be at position 1 (the first letter). 
  - Why? Because the secret word has only positions 1 and 4 unknown. Since T cannot be at position 4 (as per feedback) and positions 2,3,5 are fixed, the only available position for T is position 1.
- Therefore, the first letter is T.

Additionally, since T is present and must be at position 1, the pattern becomes: T R I _ E

Now, we only need to find the fourth letter. And it must be a letter that is:
- Not excluded: so not C, A, N, P, M, W.
- Not T (since we don't have duplicates? But not necessarily forbidden; however, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, and T is already used at position 1, so if the secret word had another T, it might have been marked differently? But in Wordle, duplicates can happen. However, in this case, since T is only marked once and as wrong position when guessed at the fourth position, and now we have placed T at first, the fourth letter cannot be T because otherwise, guessing ""write"" would have shown T as present at both positions? Actually, no: in ""write"", we guessed T only at position 4. If secret had T at position 1 and not at 4, then the T at position 4 would be marked as absent? But no: it was marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position. Since the secret has T at position 1, and we guessed T at position 4, the T at position 4 is a wrong position, but the T at position 1 is not guessed in this guess (we guessed W at position 1). Therefore, the ""-"" for T indicates that T exists elsewhere, which we deduced is position 1.

Therefore, the fourth letter must be a new letter, and not any excluded.

So the secret word is T R I ? E

Now, we need to find a letter for the fourth position that:
- Is not in the excluded list: C, A, N, P, M, W.
- Also, since we haven't seen other duplicates, and T is already used at position 1, it shouldn't be T at position 4? Actually, it could be. But why would the feedback show only one T? Because in Wordle, if a letter appears once, and you guess it once in a wrong position, you get one ""-"". If it appears twice, and you guess it once, you get one ""-"", and the other occurrence might be missing? Actually, the standard Wordle feedback: for each guess, each letter is marked independently, but if a letter appears multiple times, it's complex. However, in this case, we do not have evidence for duplication.

But to be safe, assume first there's only one T. Therefore, fourth letter is not T.

So ? is a letter not in excluded, not T, and must form a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- TRIBE: T R I B E → B at position 4? 
- TRICE: T R I C E → but C is excluded.
- TRIED: T R I E D → but E is at position 5? Secret is T R I _ E, so position 4 must be D? Then TRIED would be T,R,I,E,D? That doesn't end in E? Positions: 0:T,1:R,2:I,3:E,4:D → but secret must end with E? So not matching.

The word must be 5 letters: T R I ? E → so the fourth is ?, fifth is E.

So:
- TRIBE: T R I B E → positions 0:T,1:R,2:I,3:B,4:E → valid.
- TRICE: T R I C E → C excluded.
- TRIDE: Not a common word? TRIDE isn't standard English.
- TRIKE: T R I K E → K at position 4? Valid word?
- TRINE: T R I N E → but N is excluded.
- TRIPE: T R I P E → P is excluded.
- DRIVE: D R I V E → but first letter D? Here we need first letter T? Not T.

We have the first letter as T, so BRIDE and WRITE etc. don't work for first letter T.

So possible with T: TRIBE, TRIKE, TRIPE (excluded), etc.

What about:
- TRITE: T R I T E → has T at position 0 and 3? Then the fourth letter is T? But then in our guess ""write"": 
  - Guessed: W (position0) → absent? 
  - R (position1) → correct
  - I (position2) → correct
  - T (position3) → but if secret is TRITE, at position3 is T? Then it should be marked correct? But in feedback, T is marked as ""-"", meaning wrong position? Contradiction.

Because if secret is TRITE, then at position3 (fourth letter) is T, so when we guess T at position4 (the ""T"" in ""write, at the fourth position? Position index: in ""write"", positions are:
0: W
1: R
2: I
3: T → we guessed T at index3 (fourth letter)
4: E

Secret TRITE:
0: T
1: R
2: I
3: T
4: E

Therefore, for position3: guessed T vs secret T → should match, so marked ✓. But in feedback, it is marked as ""-"", which is wrong position. So it cannot be that the fourth letter is T. Therefore, TRITE is impossible.

Thus, fourth letter cannot be T.

Back to finding valid words: TRIBE (B), TRIKE (K), BRITE? Not common.

List:
- TRIBE: valid
- TRIED is T R I E D → ends with D, but must end with E? No: the secret word must be ? ? ? ? E, so last letter E. TRIED has last letter D? Then positions: 0:T,1:R,2:I,3:E,4:D → no, E at position3, D at position4? Doesn't match pattern T R I _ E.
- PRICE: P excluded and C excluded.

Another one: FRISE? Not common.

GRICE? Not common.

So common possibilities: TRIBE or TRIKE.

But TRIKE might be considered a word (as in tricycle, or as a verb).

Also, TRICE: not possible due to C.

Therefore, the most common is TRIBE.

But we must confirm if there are others.

Another word: SHITE? S H I T E? But second letter H not R? No: second letter must be R.

Not matching.

DRIVE starts with D, so not T.

Therefore, possible words: TRIBE (if B is allowed) or TRIKE (if K is allowed).

But B and K haven't been tested.

For TRIBE: letters B,R,I,T,E? R,I,T,E are used? T is at first.

But B is new.

Similarly for TRIKE: K is new.

Now, we can guess TRIBE to check.

We can also choose a word that tests more letters? But we have only one position unknown.

Since we know the word is T R I ? E, we can guess directly.

But to be safe, we might consider that we have three guesses left? No: it's the fourth guess.

Previous guesses: 1,2,3 → now guess4.

So we can guess TRIBE.

But let me reflect the feedback.

From guess3: T is present but not at position4, so at position1.

Therefore, secret word starts with T.

Therefore, we need to fill position4.

Options: 
- TRIBE: B
- TRIKE: K
- TRIPE: P excluded
- TRICE: C excluded
- TRINE: N excluded
- TRITE: T? But we saw conflict.

Perhaps less common: TWICE? T W I C E → but W excluded, C excluded.

No.

So between TRIBE and TRIKE.

Now, which one? In English, TRIBE is more common.

Moreover, we can look at feedback: in guess3, T is marked as present but not at position4, which leads us to position1.

Therefore, for the fourth letter, we can guess TRIBE.

But note: we need to make a guess, and if it's TRIBE, we might win or get feedback.

But if it's wrong, we have two guesses left.

We could guess a word that uses another vowel? But position4 is likely consonant.

Now, let's think: are there other possibilities?

What about D? TRIDE? Not common.

S? TRISE? Not common.

So I think TRIBE is a good guess.

But in TRIBE, we have B? Is B excluded? No, B hasn't been tested.

Similarly, K hasn't been tested.

We can guess TRIBE.

So our guess: TRIBE

Structure: T R I B E

If secret is TRIBE, then we win.

If not, we get feedback.

But since we have deduction, let's go with TRIBE.

Another candidate: TRIDE? Not recognized.

Therefore, ""tribe"" it is.

So return ""tribe"".

### Step-by-Step Thought Process

- **Review of Previous Feedback:**
  - **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
    - `R` is in the word and correctly placed at position 2 (index 1).  
    - `E` is in the word and correctly placed at position 5 (index 4).  
    - `C`, `A`, and `N` are not in the word (excluded).  
    - Secret word pattern: `_ R _ _ E`.
  
  - **Guess 2: prime → Feedback: P(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(x) E(✓)**  
    - `R` and `E` reconfirmed at positions 2 and 5.  
    - `I` is in the word and correctly placed at position 3 (index 2).  
    - `P` and `M` are not in the word (excluded).  
    - Updated secret word pattern: `_ R I _ E`.  
    - Excluded letters: `C`, `A`, `N`, `P`, `M`.

  - **Guess 3: write → Feedback: W(x) R(✓) I(✓) T(-) E(✓)**  
    - `R`, `I`, and `E` reconfirmed as correct at positions 2, 3, and 5.  
    - `W` is not in the word (excluded).  
    - `T` is in the word but not in position 4 (index 3) → wrong position.  
    - Updated secret word pattern: `? R I ? E`, with `?` representing the open positions.  
    - Excluded letters now: `C`, `A`, `N`, `P`, `M`, `W`.

- **Analysis of Unknowns:**  
  - The secret word has the fixed pattern: `? R I ? E` (positions 0,3 unknown; positions 1,2,4 fixed).  
  - Since `T` is present (from `T(-)` in Guess 3) but not in position 3 (index 3), and positions 1 (`R`), 2 (`I`), and 4 (`E`) are filled, `T` must be in position 0 (index 0).  
    - Reason: Position 3 is the only other unknown position, but `T` cannot be there per feedback (`-` at index 3 means wrong position), so `T` must be at position 0.  
  - Therefore, position 0 (first letter) is `T`.  
  - Updated secret word pattern: `T R I ? E`.  
  - Only position 3 (fourth letter, index 3) remains unknown.

- **Deduction for Position 3 (Fourth Letter):**  
  - We need a letter for position 3 that:  
    - Is not excluded: Cannot be `C`, `A`, `N`, `P`, `M`, `W` (and `T` is already at position 0).  
    - Forms a valid English word.  
  - Possible options (common words fitting `T R I ? E`):  
    - `TRIBE`: `B` at position 3 → valid word.  
    - `TRIKE`: `K` at position 3 → less common but possible (e.g., informal synonym for ""tricycle"" or a verb).  
    - `TRICE`: Invalid due to excluded `C`.  
    - `TRIPE`: Invalid due to excluded `P`.  
    - `TRINE`: Invalid due to excluded `N`.  
    - `TRITE`: Would require `T` at position 3, but this contradicts Guess 3 feedback. In Guess 3, `T` at position 3 (index 3) is marked wrong position (`-`). If `TRITE` were the word, `T` at position 3 would be correct and should show `✓`, but it was not—thus impossible.  
  - `TRIBE` is a high-frequency word and likely candidate.  
  - Choose `TRIBE` as the guess to solve the word efficiently or confirm with feedback if incorrect.

- **Strategy:**  
  - This guess (`TRIBE`) tests the deduced `T` at position 0 and `B` at position 3.  
  - If correct, feedback will be all `✓`.  
  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal if `B` is correct or not, narrowing options further (e.g., to `TRIKE`).

<guess>tribe</guess>",tribe,"We have feedback from Guess 3: write -> W(x) R(✓) I(✓) T(-) E(✓)

Breaking down the feedback for ""write"":
- W is absent (x) → W is not in the secret word.
- R is present and correct (✓) at position 2 → confirms secret[2] = 'R' (already known).
- I is present and correct (✓) at position 3 → confirms secret[3] = 'I' (already known).
- T is present but not in the correct position (-) → T is in the secret word, but not at position 4. Since we guessed T at position 4 (the fourth letter), and it's marked as ""-"", T must be in the secret word but at a different position.
- E is present and correct (✓) at position 5 → confirms secret[5] = 'E'.

Combined previous feedback:
- Known pattern: _ R I _ E
- Confirmed letters: R (pos2), I (pos3), E (pos5)
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, P, M, W (from x's)
- T is present in the word (from ""-"" in guess3) but not at position 4. Since T is not at position 4, and positions 2 and 3 are taken by R and I, respectively, and position 5 is E, T must be at position 1 (the first letter). 
  - Why? Because the secret word has only positions 1 and 4 unknown. Since T cannot be at position 4 (as per feedback) and positions 2,3,5 are fixed, the only available position for T is position 1.
- Therefore, the first letter is T.

Additionally, since T is present and must be at position 1, the pattern becomes: T R I _ E

Now, we only need to find the fourth letter. And it must be a letter that is:
- Not excluded: so not C, A, N, P, M, W.
- Not T (since we don't have duplicates? But not necessarily forbidden; however, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, and T is already used at position 1, so if the secret word had another T, it might have been marked differently? But in Wordle, duplicates can happen. However, in this case, since T is only marked once and as wrong position when guessed at the fourth position, and now we have placed T at first, the fourth letter cannot be T because otherwise, guessing ""write"" would have shown T as present at both positions? Actually, no: in ""write"", we guessed T only at position 4. If secret had T at position 1 and not at 4, then the T at position 4 would be marked as absent? But no: it was marked as ""-"" meaning present but wrong position. Since the secret has T at position 1, and we guessed T at position 4, the T at position 4 is a wrong position, but the T at position 1 is not guessed in this guess (we guessed W at position 1). Therefore, the ""-"" for T indicates that T exists elsewhere, which we deduced is position 1.

Therefore, the fourth letter must be a new letter, and not any excluded.

So the secret word is T R I ? E

Now, we need to find a letter for the fourth position that:
- Is not in the excluded list: C, A, N, P, M, W.
- Also, since we haven't seen other duplicates, and T is already used at position 1, it shouldn't be T at position 4? Actually, it could be. But why would the feedback show only one T? Because in Wordle, if a letter appears once, and you guess it once in a wrong position, you get one ""-"". If it appears twice, and you guess it once, you get one ""-"", and the other occurrence might be missing? Actually, the standard Wordle feedback: for each guess, each letter is marked independently, but if a letter appears multiple times, it's complex. However, in this case, we do not have evidence for duplication.

But to be safe, assume first there's only one T. Therefore, fourth letter is not T.

So ? is a letter not in excluded, not T, and must form a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- TRIBE: T R I B E → B at position 4? 
- TRICE: T R I C E → but C is excluded.
- TRIED: T R I E D → but E is at position 5? Secret is T R I _ E, so position 4 must be D? Then TRIED would be T,R,I,E,D? That doesn't end in E? Positions: 0:T,1:R,2:I,3:E,4:D → but secret must end with E? So not matching.

The word must be 5 letters: T R I ? E → so the fourth is ?, fifth is E.

So:
- TRIBE: T R I B E → positions 0:T,1:R,2:I,3:B,4:E → valid.
- TRICE: T R I C E → C excluded.
- TRIDE: Not a common word? TRIDE isn't standard English.
- TRIKE: T R I K E → K at position 4? Valid word?
- TRINE: T R I N E → but N is excluded.
- TRIPE: T R I P E → P is excluded.
- DRIVE: D R I V E → but first letter D? Here we need first letter T? Not T.

We have the first letter as T, so BRIDE and WRITE etc. don't work for first letter T.

So possible with T: TRIBE, TRIKE, TRIPE (excluded), etc.

What about:
- TRITE: T R I T E → has T at position 0 and 3? Then the fourth letter is T? But then in our guess ""write"": 
  - Guessed: W (position0) → absent? 
  - R (position1) → correct
  - I (position2) → correct
  - T (position3) → but if secret is TRITE, at position3 is T? Then it should be marked correct? But in feedback, T is marked as ""-"", meaning wrong position? Contradiction.

Because if secret is TRITE, then at position3 (fourth letter) is T, so when we guess T at position4 (the ""T"" in ""write, at the fourth position? Position index: in ""write"", positions are:
0: W
1: R
2: I
3: T → we guessed T at index3 (fourth letter)
4: E

Secret TRITE:
0: T
1: R
2: I
3: T
4: E

Therefore, for position3: guessed T vs secret T → should match, so marked ✓. But in feedback, it is marked as ""-"", which is wrong position. So it cannot be that the fourth letter is T. Therefore, TRITE is impossible.

Thus, fourth letter cannot be T.

Back to finding valid words: TRIBE (B), TRIKE (K), BRITE? Not common.

List:
- TRIBE: valid
- TRIED is T R I E D → ends with D, but must end with E? No: the secret word must be ? ? ? ? E, so last letter E. TRIED has last letter D? Then positions: 0:T,1:R,2:I,3:E,4:D → no, E at position3, D at position4? Doesn't match pattern T R I _ E.
- PRICE: P excluded and C excluded.

Another one: FRISE? Not common.

GRICE? Not common.

So common possibilities: TRIBE or TRIKE.

But TRIKE might be considered a word (as in tricycle, or as a verb).

Also, TRICE: not possible due to C.

Therefore, the most common is TRIBE.

But we must confirm if there are others.

Another word: SHITE? S H I T E? But second letter H not R? No: second letter must be R.

Not matching.

DRIVE starts with D, so not T.

Therefore, possible words: TRIBE (if B is allowed) or TRIKE (if K is allowed).

But B and K haven't been tested.

For TRIBE: letters B,R,I,T,E? R,I,T,E are used? T is at first.

But B is new.

Similarly for TRIKE: K is new.

Now, we can guess TRIBE to check.

We can also choose a word that tests more letters? But we have only one position unknown.

Since we know the word is T R I ? E, we can guess directly.

But to be safe, we might consider that we have three guesses left? No: it's the fourth guess.

Previous guesses: 1,2,3 → now guess4.

So we can guess TRIBE.

But let me reflect the feedback.

From guess3: T is present but not at position4, so at position1.

Therefore, secret word starts with T.

Therefore, we need to fill position4.

Options: 
- TRIBE: B
- TRIKE: K
- TRIPE: P excluded
- TRICE: C excluded
- TRINE: N excluded
- TRITE: T? But we saw conflict.

Perhaps less common: TWICE? T W I C E → but W excluded, C excluded.

No.

So between TRIBE and TRIKE.

Now, which one? In English, TRIBE is more common.

Moreover, we can look at feedback: in guess3, T is marked as present but not at position4, which leads us to position1.

Therefore, for the fourth letter, we can guess TRIBE.

But note: we need to make a guess, and if it's TRIBE, we might win or get feedback.

But if it's wrong, we have two guesses left.

We could guess a word that uses another vowel? But position4 is likely consonant.

Now, let's think: are there other possibilities?

What about D? TRIDE? Not common.

S? TRISE? Not common.

So I think TRIBE is a good guess.

But in TRIBE, we have B? Is B excluded? No, B hasn't been tested.

Similarly, K hasn't been tested.

We can guess TRIBE.

So our guess: TRIBE

Structure: T R I B E

If secret is TRIBE, then we win.

If not, we get feedback.

But since we have deduction, let's go with TRIBE.

Another candidate: TRIDE? Not recognized.

Therefore, ""tribe"" it is.

So return ""tribe"".### Step-by-Step Thought Process

- **Review of Previous Feedback:**
  - **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
    - `R` is in the word and correctly placed at position 2 (index 1).  
    - `E` is in the word and correctly placed at position 5 (index 4).  
    - `C`, `A`, and `N` are not in the word (excluded).  
    - Secret word pattern: `_ R _ _ E`.
  
  - **Guess 2: prime → Feedback: P(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(x) E(✓)**  
    - `R` and `E` reconfirmed at positions 2 and 5.  
    - `I` is in the word and correctly placed at position 3 (index 2).  
    - `P` and `M` are not in the word (excluded).  
    - Updated secret word pattern: `_ R I _ E`.  
    - Excluded letters: `C`, `A`, `N`, `P`, `M`.

  - **Guess 3: write → Feedback: W(x) R(✓) I(✓) T(-) E(✓)**  
    - `R`, `I`, and `E` reconfirmed as correct at positions 2, 3, and 5.  
    - `W` is not in the word (excluded).  
    - `T` is in the word but not in position 4 (index 3) → wrong position.  
    - Updated secret word pattern: `? R I ? E`, with `?` representing the open positions.  
    - Excluded letters now: `C`, `A`, `N`, `P`, `M`, `W`.

- **Analysis of Unknowns:**  
  - The secret word has the fixed pattern: `? R I ? E` (positions 0,3 unknown; positions 1,2,4 fixed).  
  - Since `T` is present (from `T(-)` in Guess 3) but not in position 3 (index 3), and positions 1 (`R`), 2 (`I`), and 4 (`E`) are filled, `T` must be in position 0 (index 0).  
    - Reason: Position 3 is the only other unknown position, but `T` cannot be there per feedback (`-` at index 3 means wrong position), so `T` must be at position 0.  
  - Therefore, position 0 (first letter) is `T`.  
  - Updated secret word pattern: `T R I ? E`.  
  - Only position 3 (fourth letter, index 3) remains unknown.

- **Deduction for Position 3 (Fourth Letter):**  
  - We need a letter for position 3 that:  
    - Is not excluded: Cannot be `C`, `A`, `N`, `P`, `M`, `W` (and `T` is already at position 0).  
    - Forms a valid English word.  
  - Possible options (common words fitting `T R I ? E`):  
    - `TRIBE`: `B` at position 3 → valid word.  
    - `TRIKE`: `K` at position 3 → less common but possible (e.g., informal synonym for ""tricycle"" or a verb).  
    - `TRICE`: Invalid due to excluded `C`.  
    - `TRIPE`: Invalid due to excluded `P`.  
    - `TRINE`: Invalid due to excluded `N`.  
    - `TRITE`: Would require `T` at position 3, but this contradicts Guess 3 feedback. In Guess 3, `T` at position 3 (index 3) is marked wrong position (`-`). If `TRITE` were the word, `T` at position 3 would be correct and should show `✓`, but it was not—thus impossible.  
  - `TRIBE` is a high-frequency word and likely candidate.  
  - Choose `TRIBE` as the guess to solve the word efficiently or confirm with feedback if incorrect.

- **Strategy:**  
  - This guess (`TRIBE`) tests the deduced `T` at position 0 and `B` at position 3.  
  - If correct, feedback will be all `✓`.  
  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal if `B` is correct or not, narrowing options further (e.g., to `TRIKE`).",Guess 4: tribe -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) I(✓) B(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
