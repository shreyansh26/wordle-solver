We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we have no prior information.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common letters and vowels to maximize the information we get.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 So, my first guess will be: RAISE
</think>
<thought>
As this is the first guess in Wordle, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The ideal starting word should:
- Contain common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) since most words have vowels
- Include frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N) 
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more unique characters
- Have balanced letter distribution

""RAISE"" is a strong starting choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E)
- Includes two high-frequency consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique (no duplicates)
- It's a common English word accepted in word games

This guess will provide valuable feedback about:
- Presence/absence of critical vowels (A, I, E)
- Information about consonants (R, S)
- Positional accuracy for these letters

The feedback will help narrow down possible solutions for subsequent guesses.

We are on our second guess. The previous feedback for ""RAISE"" was:
 R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)

 This means:
 - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)
 - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)
 - R, A, and E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has the letter 'I' as the third letter and 'S' as the fourth letter.
 Also, it does not contain R, A, or E.

 Since the word is 5 letters, we know the positions:
   _ _ I S _

 Now, we need to make a guess that:
   - Has 'I' in the third position and 'S' in the fourth position.
   - Avoids using R, A, E.

 We also want to use common letters that haven't been tested yet to gather more information.

 Possible letters for the other positions: avoid R, A, E.

 Common consonants that might appear: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we don't have any correct first or last letters, we should try to cover frequent consonants.

 We can try to form words that fit the pattern _ _ I S _

 Examples: 
   TWIST (T,W,I,S,T) -> but T is repeated, and we don't know if T is in the word? Also, the last letter is T, which we haven't tested.
   OOPS? Not 5 letters.

 Let's think of words that end with S? But wait, we know S is in the fourth position, so the last letter is something else.

 Actually, the word must end with a letter we haven't tested, and the pattern is _ _ I S _ -> so the last letter is the fifth.

 Words matching: [letter1][letter2]I S [letter5]

 We don't know letter1, letter2, letter5.

 We must avoid R, A, E.

 Let me recall common words: 
   ""QUITS"" -> Q is not very common? Also, avoids R,A,E? But Q and U: U is a vowel, but not forbidden because we only know R,A,E are absent. But let's see: 
   But Q and U often come together. However, our pattern: Q U I T S -> third letter I and fourth S? Wait: 
     Position1: Q, Position2: U, Position3: I, Position4: T, Position5: S -> but we need fourth position to be S? So that doesn't fit.

 Actually, we require the fourth letter to be S. So the word is ? ? I S ? 

 Examples:
   BLISS: B L I S S -> but S repeats? And we have S in the fourth and fifth? But our pattern: position4 is S, and position5 would be S? That's possible? 
   However, we have feedback only that S is in the word and in position 4. It doesn't say anything about duplicate S? We must be cautious.

   The feedback for RAISE: S was in position 4 and we got ✓ meaning that the secret word has S in position 4. So the word has at least one S. 
   But it might have more? 

   However, we know that the word has the letter I in position 3 and S in position 4. 

   Other words: 
     ""TWIST"": T W I S T -> positions: 
        1: T, 2: W, 3: I, 4: S, 5: T -> fits the pattern? 
        But note: we haven't tested T and W. And we must avoid A, R, E? Yes. So it's a candidate.

   Another: ""THIS"" is only 4 letters. 
   ""CHISM"" -> not a word? 

   Let's try ""TOILS"": T O I L S -> but then the fourth letter would be L? No, we need fourth letter S. 
   So T O I S T? Not a word.

   How about ""TAWIS""? Not common.

   Another: ""OWISH""? Not a word.

   Let's think: 
     ""FISTS"" -> but S repeats. Pattern: F I S T S? Wait, positions: 
        1: F, 2: I? No, we need position 3 to be I. So: position3 must be I. 
        So ""FISTS"": F I S T S -> 
          position1: F, position2: I, position3: S -> doesn't match.

   We need the word to have I at position 3 and S at position 4.

   ""POISY""? Not a word.

   ""BLIST"" -> not a word.

   ""GUIST""? Not common.

   ""JOIST"": 
        J O I S T -> 
        positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> matches.

   ""MOIST"": M O I S T -> same pattern.

   ""HOIST"": H O I S T.

   ""FOIST"": F O I S T.

   ""DUIST""? Not a word.

   So common words: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.

   Let's choose one that uses letters we haven't tried? 

   For JOIST: 
     Letters: J, O, I, S, T -> but I and S are already known. So we test J, O, T.

   Similarly for MOIST: M, O, T.

   We want to cover more ground? So let's choose a word that has common letters we haven't tried, such as T and O? 

   Also, note the first guess only tested R,A,I,S,E. So we haven't tested O, T, etc.

   But wait: we also know the word doesn't have R, A, E. 

   We can choose ""MOIST"": 
        M O I S T

   Why this? 
     - We are testing M, O, T in new positions.

   Alternatively, we can choose ""TWIST"": T W I S T -> but note, TWIST uses T twice? So we wouldn't get information about T if it's duplicated? 
   Also, W is less common. 

   Let me consider: 
        T is in positions 1 and 5? That might not be optimal because we get two T's at once? But if T is in the word, then we might get a ✓ for one or both? 
        However, we don't know if T is present. So using two T's might be inefficient? 

   So ""MOIST"" is better because all letters are distinct? And we test three new letters: M, O, T.

   We might also consider ""TOUIS"" -> not a word.

   Another common one: ""CHIPS"" -> C H I P S -> position1:C,2:H,3:I,4:P,5:S -> doesn't fit because position4 is P, not S.

   So ""MOIST"" seems a valid candidate.

   However, note that the fifth letter is T. We haven't tested T before. 

   Alternatively, ""FOIST"" has F and O and T.

   Let me look for words that have the pattern and also include common consonants that we haven't tried: like T, O, N, etc.

   What about ""OPSIS""? -> O P S I S -> but then position3 is S? No, we need I at position3.

   How about ""BOLIS""? -> B O L I S -> position5? No pattern ? We need fourth to be S? Actually: 
        Position: 1:B,2:O,3:L (should be I) -> doesn't match.

   Let's stick to the words we found: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.

   Let me choose ""MOIST"" because M and O are relatively common.

   We must also consider that if the word has only one S, then our guess must have S only in position4? Or if there's another S, that's okay? 

   The feedback from RAISE said position4: S(✓) but it doesn't tell about other positions? So we don't know if there are duplicate S? 

   But our pattern requires position4 as S, so we know at least one S is there.

   In MOIST: we are putting S only at position4? So if the secret word has an S elsewhere, we might get a '-' for that? But in MOIST there isn't another S? 

   MOIST: M,O,I,S,T -> one S.

   So if the secret word has another S, we won't detect it? But we don't care for now? We are just trying to get more information.

   Alternatively, we could use a word that has another letter in the fifth position that we haven't tested? 

   But MOIST seems acceptable.

   However, note: what if the secret word is ""CHIKS""? -> no, but we haven't thought of K? 

   I think MOIST is a good candidate.

   Let me check if ""MOIST"" is an accepted word? Yes, it means slightly damp, and it's accepted in Wordle.

   So we guess: MOIST

   If we get feedback:
     We know that I and S are correct and in position. So we expect ✓ at position3 and ✓ at position4? Always? But what about duplicated letters? 
        In this case, MOIST doesn't duplicate any letters? 

   However, if the secret word has a double letter, we haven't accounted for it? But in the first guess we didn't have any indication of duplication? 

   Also, we avoid R,A,E? So MOIST doesn't have R,A,E.

   So I'll go with MOIST.

   But note: what if the secret word is ""BLISS""? 
        Pattern: _ _ I S S -> because fourth is S and fifth is S? 
        Then our MOIST: 
            position1: M vs B? 
            position2: O vs L?
            position5: T vs S?

        Then feedback:
            M: x (if secret is BLISS, then M is not in word)
            O: x (O not in word? BLISS has B,L,I,S,S -> no O and no M, and T is also absent? But T might be? Wait: secret has B,L,I,S,S -> letters: B,L,I,S)
            I: ✓ (correct)
            S: ✓ (correct? because position4? yes, but note there are two S? The feedback for S in MOIST: 
                The first S in MOIST is at position4? That matches. The secret word has S at position4 and position5? 
            T: x (not in word)

        So feedback would be: M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(✓), T(x)

        Then we'd know only positions 3 and 4 are correct? And letters M,O,T are absent? 

        But we already know O? Then we can infer the last letter? 

        However, if we guess MOIST and get that, we'd know the word is ? ? I S ? which cannot be R,A,E and now also cannot be M,O,T? 

        So then we have letters in positions: 
          Position3: I (fixed), Position4: S (fixed)
          Position1: must be not R,A,E,M,O,T? 
          Position2: same constraints? 
          Position5: not R,A,E,M,O,T

        And the word must contain I and S and whatever other letters? 

        Alternatively, if the word is BLISS, then we'll get the above feedback. But we don't know the fifth letter? 

        After guessing MOIST, if we get M and O and T as absent, then we can try words like ""BLISS"" or ""FLOSS""? But FLOSS: F L O S S -> O is absent? Not allowed? 

        Wait: our feedback would show O as absent? So we can't use O? So in the next guess, we try? 

        Position5: since T is absent? So we need a letter that isn't R,A,E,M,O,T? 

        And the first letter isn't R,A,E,M,O,T? 

        So BLISS: B and L and S? But S we already know? 

        We can try ""BLISS"" as a guess? But we have two S? 

        Actually, we are building information.

   Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a different set of letters? 

   Another candidate: ""THINS"" -> T H I N S -> but then we need fourth letter to be S? 
        Positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:S -> doesn't work because fourth is N? Not S.

   So no.

   Another: ""TOILS"" -> T O I L S -> positions: 1:T,2:O,3:I,4:L,5:S -> again, fourth is L? Not S.

   So we stick with the pattern _ _ I S _.

   Another word: ""KUISH"" -> not common? 

   Maybe ""QUIPUS""? too long.

   So I think MOIST is acceptable.

   Let's go with that.

   Guess: MOIST

   But wait: there is another word ""WAIFS"" doesn't fit.

   Considered words: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.

   Why not HOIST? H is also a common letter? 
   HOIST: H O I S T -> same pattern.

   But M is less common than H? Actually, H and M both are common? 

   I think either is fine. Let me pick MOIST arbitrarily.

   Alternatively, to maximize coverage of common letters? We could choose one with T? 

   Since T is a very common letter, having T in the fifth position? So MOIST tests T? 

   We can also consider that the secret word might end with T? 

   So MOIST is good.

   Final decision: MOIST.
</think>
### Thought Process
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- ""I"" is in the correct position (3rd letter) ➡️ Must appear in position 3 of the secret word.
- ""S"" is in the correct position (4th letter) ➡️ Must appear in position 4 of the secret word.
- ""R"", ""A"", and ""E"" are absent ➡️ Cannot appear anywhere in the secret word.

The secret word pattern is: _ _ **I** **S** _  
- Position 3: ""I""  
- Position 4: ""S""  
- Positions 1, 2, and 5: Unknown letters (excluding R, A, E).  

### Strategy for Second Guess
1. **Prioritize common letters**: Test new frequent consonants (e.g., T, O, M, H) to gain information.  
2. **Fit the pattern**: Guess must include ""I"" at position 3 and ""S"" at position 4.  
3. **Avoid excluded letters**: No R, A, or E.  
4. **Consider word candidates**: Valid English words fitting `_ _ I S _`. Strong options include:  
   - **MOIST** (M, O, I, S, T) → Tests M, O, T (all new letters)  
   - HOIST (H, O, I, S, T) → Tests H, O, T  
   - FOIST (F, O, I, S, T) → Tests F, O, T  
   - JOIST (J, O, I, S, T) → Tests J, O, T  

**Why choose ""MOIST""?**  
- Uses distinct common letters (M, O, T) not tested yet.  
- High information potential: Reveals presence/absence of M/O/T and their positions.  
- Validates if the 5th letter could be T (a common word ending).  

If ""MOIST"" is incorrect, feedback will help narrow options further (e.g., confirming M/O/T inclusion or exclusion).

<guess>MOIST</guess>",MOIST,"We are on our second guess. The previous feedback for ""RAISE"" was:
 R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)

 This means:
 - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)
 - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)
 - R, A, and E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has the letter 'I' as the third letter and 'S' as the fourth letter.
 Also, it does not contain R, A, or E.

 Since the word is 5 letters, we know the positions:
   _ _ I S _

 Now, we need to make a guess that:
   - Has 'I' in the third position and 'S' in the fourth position.
   - Avoids using R, A, E.

 We also want to use common letters that haven't been tested yet to gather more information.

 Possible letters for the other positions: avoid R, A, E.

 Common consonants that might appear: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we don't have any correct first or last letters, we should try to cover frequent consonants.

 We can try to form words that fit the pattern _ _ I S _

 Examples: 
   TWIST (T,W,I,S,T) -> but T is repeated, and we don't know if T is in the word? Also, the last letter is T, which we haven't tested.
   OOPS? Not 5 letters.

 Let's think of words that end with S? But wait, we know S is in the fourth position, so the last letter is something else.

 Actually, the word must end with a letter we haven't tested, and the pattern is _ _ I S _ -> so the last letter is the fifth.

 Words matching: [letter1][letter2]I S [letter5]

 We don't know letter1, letter2, letter5.

 We must avoid R, A, E.

 Let me recall common words: 
   ""QUITS"" -> Q is not very common? Also, avoids R,A,E? But Q and U: U is a vowel, but not forbidden because we only know R,A,E are absent. But let's see: 
   But Q and U often come together. However, our pattern: Q U I T S -> third letter I and fourth S? Wait: 
     Position1: Q, Position2: U, Position3: I, Position4: T, Position5: S -> but we need fourth position to be S? So that doesn't fit.

 Actually, we require the fourth letter to be S. So the word is ? ? I S ? 

 Examples:
   BLISS: B L I S S -> but S repeats? And we have S in the fourth and fifth? But our pattern: position4 is S, and position5 would be S? That's possible? 
   However, we have feedback only that S is in the word and in position 4. It doesn't say anything about duplicate S? We must be cautious.

   The feedback for RAISE: S was in position 4 and we got ✓ meaning that the secret word has S in position 4. So the word has at least one S. 
   But it might have more? 

   However, we know that the word has the letter I in position 3 and S in position 4. 

   Other words: 
     ""TWIST"": T W I S T -> positions: 
        1: T, 2: W, 3: I, 4: S, 5: T -> fits the pattern? 
        But note: we haven't tested T and W. And we must avoid A, R, E? Yes. So it's a candidate.

   Another: ""THIS"" is only 4 letters. 
   ""CHISM"" -> not a word? 

   Let's try ""TOILS"": T O I L S -> but then the fourth letter would be L? No, we need fourth letter S. 
   So T O I S T? Not a word.

   How about ""TAWIS""? Not common.

   Another: ""OWISH""? Not a word.

   Let's think: 
     ""FISTS"" -> but S repeats. Pattern: F I S T S? Wait, positions: 
        1: F, 2: I? No, we need position 3 to be I. So: position3 must be I. 
        So ""FISTS"": F I S T S -> 
          position1: F, position2: I, position3: S -> doesn't match.

   We need the word to have I at position 3 and S at position 4.

   ""POISY""? Not a word.

   ""BLIST"" -> not a word.

   ""GUIST""? Not common.

   ""JOIST"": 
        J O I S T -> 
        positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> matches.

   ""MOIST"": M O I S T -> same pattern.

   ""HOIST"": H O I S T.

   ""FOIST"": F O I S T.

   ""DUIST""? Not a word.

   So common words: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.

   Let's choose one that uses letters we haven't tried? 

   For JOIST: 
     Letters: J, O, I, S, T -> but I and S are already known. So we test J, O, T.

   Similarly for MOIST: M, O, T.

   We want to cover more ground? So let's choose a word that has common letters we haven't tried, such as T and O? 

   Also, note the first guess only tested R,A,I,S,E. So we haven't tested O, T, etc.

   But wait: we also know the word doesn't have R, A, E. 

   We can choose ""MOIST"": 
        M O I S T

   Why this? 
     - We are testing M, O, T in new positions.

   Alternatively, we can choose ""TWIST"": T W I S T -> but note, TWIST uses T twice? So we wouldn't get information about T if it's duplicated? 
   Also, W is less common. 

   Let me consider: 
        T is in positions 1 and 5? That might not be optimal because we get two T's at once? But if T is in the word, then we might get a ✓ for one or both? 
        However, we don't know if T is present. So using two T's might be inefficient? 

   So ""MOIST"" is better because all letters are distinct? And we test three new letters: M, O, T.

   We might also consider ""TOUIS"" -> not a word.

   Another common one: ""CHIPS"" -> C H I P S -> position1:C,2:H,3:I,4:P,5:S -> doesn't fit because position4 is P, not S.

   So ""MOIST"" seems a valid candidate.

   However, note that the fifth letter is T. We haven't tested T before. 

   Alternatively, ""FOIST"" has F and O and T.

   Let me look for words that have the pattern and also include common consonants that we haven't tried: like T, O, N, etc.

   What about ""OPSIS""? -> O P S I S -> but then position3 is S? No, we need I at position3.

   How about ""BOLIS""? -> B O L I S -> position5? No pattern ? We need fourth to be S? Actually: 
        Position: 1:B,2:O,3:L (should be I) -> doesn't match.

   Let's stick to the words we found: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.

   Let me choose ""MOIST"" because M and O are relatively common.

   We must also consider that if the word has only one S, then our guess must have S only in position4? Or if there's another S, that's okay? 

   The feedback from RAISE said position4: S(✓) but it doesn't tell about other positions? So we don't know if there are duplicate S? 

   But our pattern requires position4 as S, so we know at least one S is there.

   In MOIST: we are putting S only at position4? So if the secret word has an S elsewhere, we might get a '-' for that? But in MOIST there isn't another S? 

   MOIST: M,O,I,S,T -> one S.

   So if the secret word has another S, we won't detect it? But we don't care for now? We are just trying to get more information.

   Alternatively, we could use a word that has another letter in the fifth position that we haven't tested? 

   But MOIST seems acceptable.

   However, note: what if the secret word is ""CHIKS""? -> no, but we haven't thought of K? 

   I think MOIST is a good candidate.

   Let me check if ""MOIST"" is an accepted word? Yes, it means slightly damp, and it's accepted in Wordle.

   So we guess: MOIST

   If we get feedback:
     We know that I and S are correct and in position. So we expect ✓ at position3 and ✓ at position4? Always? But what about duplicated letters? 
        In this case, MOIST doesn't duplicate any letters? 

   However, if the secret word has a double letter, we haven't accounted for it? But in the first guess we didn't have any indication of duplication? 

   Also, we avoid R,A,E? So MOIST doesn't have R,A,E.

   So I'll go with MOIST.

   But note: what if the secret word is ""BLISS""? 
        Pattern: _ _ I S S -> because fourth is S and fifth is S? 
        Then our MOIST: 
            position1: M vs B? 
            position2: O vs L?
            position5: T vs S?

        Then feedback:
            M: x (if secret is BLISS, then M is not in word)
            O: x (O not in word? BLISS has B,L,I,S,S -> no O and no M, and T is also absent? But T might be? Wait: secret has B,L,I,S,S -> letters: B,L,I,S)
            I: ✓ (correct)
            S: ✓ (correct? because position4? yes, but note there are two S? The feedback for S in MOIST: 
                The first S in MOIST is at position4? That matches. The secret word has S at position4 and position5? 
            T: x (not in word)

        So feedback would be: M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(✓), T(x)

        Then we'd know only positions 3 and 4 are correct? And letters M,O,T are absent? 

        But we already know O? Then we can infer the last letter? 

        However, if we guess MOIST and get that, we'd know the word is ? ? I S ? which cannot be R,A,E and now also cannot be M,O,T? 

        So then we have letters in positions: 
          Position3: I (fixed), Position4: S (fixed)
          Position1: must be not R,A,E,M,O,T? 
          Position2: same constraints? 
          Position5: not R,A,E,M,O,T

        And the word must contain I and S and whatever other letters? 

        Alternatively, if the word is BLISS, then we'll get the above feedback. But we don't know the fifth letter? 

        After guessing MOIST, if we get M and O and T as absent, then we can try words like ""BLISS"" or ""FLOSS""? But FLOSS: F L O S S -> O is absent? Not allowed? 

        Wait: our feedback would show O as absent? So we can't use O? So in the next guess, we try? 

        Position5: since T is absent? So we need a letter that isn't R,A,E,M,O,T? 

        And the first letter isn't R,A,E,M,O,T? 

        So BLISS: B and L and S? But S we already know? 

        We can try ""BLISS"" as a guess? But we have two S? 

        Actually, we are building information.

   Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a different set of letters? 

   Another candidate: ""THINS"" -> T H I N S -> but then we need fourth letter to be S? 
        Positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:S -> doesn't work because fourth is N? Not S.

   So no.

   Another: ""TOILS"" -> T O I L S -> positions: 1:T,2:O,3:I,4:L,5:S -> again, fourth is L? Not S.

   So we stick with the pattern _ _ I S _.

   Another word: ""KUISH"" -> not common? 

   Maybe ""QUIPUS""? too long.

   So I think MOIST is acceptable.

   Let's go with that.

   Guess: MOIST

   But wait: there is another word ""WAIFS"" doesn't fit.

   Considered words: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.

   Why not HOIST? H is also a common letter? 
   HOIST: H O I S T -> same pattern.

   But M is less common than H? Actually, H and M both are common? 

   I think either is fine. Let me pick MOIST arbitrarily.

   Alternatively, to maximize coverage of common letters? We could choose one with T? 

   Since T is a very common letter, having T in the fifth position? So MOIST tests T? 

   We can also consider that the secret word might end with T? 

   So MOIST is good.

   Final decision: MOIST.### Thought Process
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- ""I"" is in the correct position (3rd letter) ➡️ Must appear in position 3 of the secret word.
- ""S"" is in the correct position (4th letter) ➡️ Must appear in position 4 of the secret word.
- ""R"", ""A"", and ""E"" are absent ➡️ Cannot appear anywhere in the secret word.

The secret word pattern is: _ _ **I** **S** _  
- Position 3: ""I""  
- Position 4: ""S""  
- Positions 1, 2, and 5: Unknown letters (excluding R, A, E).  

### Strategy for Second Guess
1. **Prioritize common letters**: Test new frequent consonants (e.g., T, O, M, H) to gain information.  
2. **Fit the pattern**: Guess must include ""I"" at position 3 and ""S"" at position 4.  
3. **Avoid excluded letters**: No R, A, or E.  
4. **Consider word candidates**: Valid English words fitting `_ _ I S _`. Strong options include:  
   - **MOIST** (M, O, I, S, T) → Tests M, O, T (all new letters)  
   - HOIST (H, O, I, S, T) → Tests H, O, T  
   - FOIST (F, O, I, S, T) → Tests F, O, T  
   - JOIST (J, O, I, S, T) → Tests J, O, T  

**Why choose ""MOIST""?**  
- Uses distinct common letters (M, O, T) not tested yet.  
- High information potential: Reveals presence/absence of M/O/T and their positions.  
- Validates if the 5th letter could be T (a common word ending).  

If ""MOIST"" is incorrect, feedback will help narrow options further (e.g., confirming M/O/T inclusion or exclusion).",Guess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(✓) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,SWISH,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we have no prior information.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common letters and vowels to maximize the information we get.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 So, my first guess will be: RAISE<thought>
As this is the first guess in Wordle, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The ideal starting word should:
- Contain common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) since most words have vowels
- Include frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N) 
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more unique characters
- Have balanced letter distribution

""RAISE"" is a strong starting choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E)
- Includes two high-frequency consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique (no duplicates)
- It's a common English word accepted in word games

This guess will provide valuable feedback about:
- Presence/absence of critical vowels (A, I, E)
- Information about consonants (R, S)
- Positional accuracy for these letters

The feedback will help narrow down possible solutions for subsequent guesses.
</thought>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on our second guess. The previous feedback for ""RAISE"" was:
 R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)

 This means:
 - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)
 - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)
 - R, A, and E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has the letter 'I' as the third letter and 'S' as the fourth letter.
 Also, it does not contain R, A, or E.

 Since the word is 5 letters, we know the positions:
   _ _ I S _

 Now, we need to make a guess that:
   - Has 'I' in the third position and 'S' in the fourth position.
   - Avoids using R, A, E.

 We also want to use common letters that haven't been tested yet to gather more information.

 Possible letters for the other positions: avoid R, A, E.

 Common consonants that might appear: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we don't have any correct first or last letters, we should try to cover frequent consonants.

 We can try to form words that fit the pattern _ _ I S _

 Examples: 
   TWIST (T,W,I,S,T) -> but T is repeated, and we don't know if T is in the word? Also, the last letter is T, which we haven't tested.
   OOPS? Not 5 letters.

 Let's think of words that end with S? But wait, we know S is in the fourth position, so the last letter is something else.

 Actually, the word must end with a letter we haven't tested, and the pattern is _ _ I S _ -> so the last letter is the fifth.

 Words matching: [letter1][letter2]I S [letter5]

 We don't know letter1, letter2, letter5.

 We must avoid R, A, E.

 Let me recall common words: 
   ""QUITS"" -> Q is not very common? Also, avoids R,A,E? But Q and U: U is a vowel, but not forbidden because we only know R,A,E are absent. But let's see: 
   But Q and U often come together. However, our pattern: Q U I T S -> third letter I and fourth S? Wait: 
     Position1: Q, Position2: U, Position3: I, Position4: T, Position5: S -> but we need fourth position to be S? So that doesn't fit.

 Actually, we require the fourth letter to be S. So the word is ? ? I S ? 

 Examples:
   BLISS: B L I S S -> but S repeats? And we have S in the fourth and fifth? But our pattern: position4 is S, and position5 would be S? That's possible? 
   However, we have feedback only that S is in the word and in position 4. It doesn't say anything about duplicate S? We must be cautious.

   The feedback for RAISE: S was in position 4 and we got ✓ meaning that the secret word has S in position 4. So the word has at least one S. 
   But it might have more? 

   However, we know that the word has the letter I in position 3 and S in position 4. 

   Other words: 
     ""TWIST"": T W I S T -> positions: 
        1: T, 2: W, 3: I, 4: S, 5: T -> fits the pattern? 
        But note: we haven't tested T and W. And we must avoid A, R, E? Yes. So it's a candidate.

   Another: ""THIS"" is only 4 letters. 
   ""CHISM"" -> not a word? 

   Let's try ""TOILS"": T O I L S -> but then the fourth letter would be L? No, we need fourth letter S. 
   So T O I S T? Not a word.

   How about ""TAWIS""? Not common.

   Another: ""OWISH""? Not a word.

   Let's think: 
     ""FISTS"" -> but S repeats. Pattern: F I S T S? Wait, positions: 
        1: F, 2: I? No, we need position 3 to be I. So: position3 must be I. 
        So ""FISTS"": F I S T S -> 
          position1: F, position2: I, position3: S -> doesn't match.

   We need the word to have I at position 3 and S at position 4.

   ""POISY""? Not a word.

   ""BLIST"" -> not a word.

   ""GUIST""? Not common.

   ""JOIST"": 
        J O I S T -> 
        positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> matches.

   ""MOIST"": M O I S T -> same pattern.

   ""HOIST"": H O I S T.

   ""FOIST"": F O I S T.

   ""DUIST""? Not a word.

   So common words: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.

   Let's choose one that uses letters we haven't tried? 

   For JOIST: 
     Letters: J, O, I, S, T -> but I and S are already known. So we test J, O, T.

   Similarly for MOIST: M, O, T.

   We want to cover more ground? So let's choose a word that has common letters we haven't tried, such as T and O? 

   Also, note the first guess only tested R,A,I,S,E. So we haven't tested O, T, etc.

   But wait: we also know the word doesn't have R, A, E. 

   We can choose ""MOIST"": 
        M O I S T

   Why this? 
     - We are testing M, O, T in new positions.

   Alternatively, we can choose ""TWIST"": T W I S T -> but note, TWIST uses T twice? So we wouldn't get information about T if it's duplicated? 
   Also, W is less common. 

   Let me consider: 
        T is in positions 1 and 5? That might not be optimal because we get two T's at once? But if T is in the word, then we might get a ✓ for one or both? 
        However, we don't know if T is present. So using two T's might be inefficient? 

   So ""MOIST"" is better because all letters are distinct? And we test three new letters: M, O, T.

   We might also consider ""TOUIS"" -> not a word.

   Another common one: ""CHIPS"" -> C H I P S -> position1:C,2:H,3:I,4:P,5:S -> doesn't fit because position4 is P, not S.

   So ""MOIST"" seems a valid candidate.

   However, note that the fifth letter is T. We haven't tested T before. 

   Alternatively, ""FOIST"" has F and O and T.

   Let me look for words that have the pattern and also include common consonants that we haven't tried: like T, O, N, etc.

   What about ""OPSIS""? -> O P S I S -> but then position3 is S? No, we need I at position3.

   How about ""BOLIS""? -> B O L I S -> position5? No pattern ? We need fourth to be S? Actually: 
        Position: 1:B,2:O,3:L (should be I) -> doesn't match.

   Let's stick to the words we found: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.

   Let me choose ""MOIST"" because M and O are relatively common.

   We must also consider that if the word has only one S, then our guess must have S only in position4? Or if there's another S, that's okay? 

   The feedback from RAISE said position4: S(✓) but it doesn't tell about other positions? So we don't know if there are duplicate S? 

   But our pattern requires position4 as S, so we know at least one S is there.

   In MOIST: we are putting S only at position4? So if the secret word has an S elsewhere, we might get a '-' for that? But in MOIST there isn't another S? 

   MOIST: M,O,I,S,T -> one S.

   So if the secret word has another S, we won't detect it? But we don't care for now? We are just trying to get more information.

   Alternatively, we could use a word that has another letter in the fifth position that we haven't tested? 

   But MOIST seems acceptable.

   However, note: what if the secret word is ""CHIKS""? -> no, but we haven't thought of K? 

   I think MOIST is a good candidate.

   Let me check if ""MOIST"" is an accepted word? Yes, it means slightly damp, and it's accepted in Wordle.

   So we guess: MOIST

   If we get feedback:
     We know that I and S are correct and in position. So we expect ✓ at position3 and ✓ at position4? Always? But what about duplicated letters? 
        In this case, MOIST doesn't duplicate any letters? 

   However, if the secret word has a double letter, we haven't accounted for it? But in the first guess we didn't have any indication of duplication? 

   Also, we avoid R,A,E? So MOIST doesn't have R,A,E.

   So I'll go with MOIST.

   But note: what if the secret word is ""BLISS""? 
        Pattern: _ _ I S S -> because fourth is S and fifth is S? 
        Then our MOIST: 
            position1: M vs B? 
            position2: O vs L?
            position5: T vs S?

        Then feedback:
            M: x (if secret is BLISS, then M is not in word)
            O: x (O not in word? BLISS has B,L,I,S,S -> no O and no M, and T is also absent? But T might be? Wait: secret has B,L,I,S,S -> letters: B,L,I,S)
            I: ✓ (correct)
            S: ✓ (correct? because position4? yes, but note there are two S? The feedback for S in MOIST: 
                The first S in MOIST is at position4? That matches. The secret word has S at position4 and position5? 
            T: x (not in word)

        So feedback would be: M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(✓), T(x)

        Then we'd know only positions 3 and 4 are correct? And letters M,O,T are absent? 

        But we already know O? Then we can infer the last letter? 

        However, if we guess MOIST and get that, we'd know the word is ? ? I S ? which cannot be R,A,E and now also cannot be M,O,T? 

        So then we have letters in positions: 
          Position3: I (fixed), Position4: S (fixed)
          Position1: must be not R,A,E,M,O,T? 
          Position2: same constraints? 
          Position5: not R,A,E,M,O,T

        And the word must contain I and S and whatever other letters? 

        Alternatively, if the word is BLISS, then we'll get the above feedback. But we don't know the fifth letter? 

        After guessing MOIST, if we get M and O and T as absent, then we can try words like ""BLISS"" or ""FLOSS""? But FLOSS: F L O S S -> O is absent? Not allowed? 

        Wait: our feedback would show O as absent? So we can't use O? So in the next guess, we try? 

        Position5: since T is absent? So we need a letter that isn't R,A,E,M,O,T? 

        And the first letter isn't R,A,E,M,O,T? 

        So BLISS: B and L and S? But S we already know? 

        We can try ""BLISS"" as a guess? But we have two S? 

        Actually, we are building information.

   Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a different set of letters? 

   Another candidate: ""THINS"" -> T H I N S -> but then we need fourth letter to be S? 
        Positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:S -> doesn't work because fourth is N? Not S.

   So no.

   Another: ""TOILS"" -> T O I L S -> positions: 1:T,2:O,3:I,4:L,5:S -> again, fourth is L? Not S.

   So we stick with the pattern _ _ I S _.

   Another word: ""KUISH"" -> not common? 

   Maybe ""QUIPUS""? too long.

   So I think MOIST is acceptable.

   Let's go with that.

   Guess: MOIST

   But wait: there is another word ""WAIFS"" doesn't fit.

   Considered words: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.

   Why not HOIST? H is also a common letter? 
   HOIST: H O I S T -> same pattern.

   But M is less common than H? Actually, H and M both are common? 

   I think either is fine. Let me pick MOIST arbitrarily.

   Alternatively, to maximize coverage of common letters? We could choose one with T? 

   Since T is a very common letter, having T in the fifth position? So MOIST tests T? 

   We can also consider that the secret word might end with T? 

   So MOIST is good.

   Final decision: MOIST.### Thought Process
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- ""I"" is in the correct position (3rd letter) ➡️ Must appear in position 3 of the secret word.
- ""S"" is in the correct position (4th letter) ➡️ Must appear in position 4 of the secret word.
- ""R"", ""A"", and ""E"" are absent ➡️ Cannot appear anywhere in the secret word.

The secret word pattern is: _ _ **I** **S** _  
- Position 3: ""I""  
- Position 4: ""S""  
- Positions 1, 2, and 5: Unknown letters (excluding R, A, E).  

### Strategy for Second Guess
1. **Prioritize common letters**: Test new frequent consonants (e.g., T, O, M, H) to gain information.  
2. **Fit the pattern**: Guess must include ""I"" at position 3 and ""S"" at position 4.  
3. **Avoid excluded letters**: No R, A, or E.  
4. **Consider word candidates**: Valid English words fitting `_ _ I S _`. Strong options include:  
   - **MOIST** (M, O, I, S, T) → Tests M, O, T (all new letters)  
   - HOIST (H, O, I, S, T) → Tests H, O, T  
   - FOIST (F, O, I, S, T) → Tests F, O, T  
   - JOIST (J, O, I, S, T) → Tests J, O, T  

**Why choose ""MOIST""?**  
- Uses distinct common letters (M, O, T) not tested yet.  
- High information potential: Reveals presence/absence of M/O/T and their positions.  
- Validates if the 5th letter could be T (a common word ending).  

If ""MOIST"" is incorrect, feedback will help narrow options further (e.g., confirming M/O/T inclusion or exclusion).

Also, the last letter is T, which we haven\'t tested.\n   OOPS? Not 5 letters.\n\n Let\'s think of words that end with S? But wait, we know S is in the fourth position, so the last letter is something else.\n\n Actually, the word must end with a letter we haven\'t tested, and the pattern is _ _ I S _ -> so the last letter is the fifth.\n\n Words matching: [letter1][letter2]I S [letter5]\n\n We don\'t know letter1, letter2, letter5.\n\n We must avoid R, A, E.\n\n Let me recall common words: \n   ""QUITS"" -> Q is not very common? Also, avoids R,A,E? But Q and U: U is a vowel, but not forbidden because we only know R,A,E are absent. But let\'s see: \n   But Q and U often come together. However, our pattern: Q U I T S -> third letter I and fourth S? Wait: \n     Position1: Q, Position2: U, Position3: I, Position4: T, Position5: S -> but we need fourth position to be S? So that doesn\'t fit.\n\n Actually, we require the fourth letter to be S. So the word is ? ? I S ? \n\n Examples:\n   BLISS: B L I S S -> but S repeats? And we have S in the fourth and fifth? But our pattern: position4 is S, and position5 would be S? That\'s possible? \n   However, we have feedback only that S is in the word and in position 4. It doesn\'t say anything about duplicate S? We must be cautious.\n\n   The feedback for RAISE: S was in position 4 and we got ✓ meaning that the secret word has S in position 4. So the word has at least one S. \n   But it might have more? \n\n   However, we know that the word has the letter I in position 3 and S in position 4. \n\n   Other words: \n     ""TWIST"": T W I S T -> positions: \n        1: T, 2: W, 3: I, 4: S, 5: T -> fits the pattern? \n        But note: we haven\'t tested T and W. And we must avoid A, R, E? Yes. So it\'s a candidate.\n\n   Another: ""THIS"" is only 4 letters. \n   ""CHISM"" -> not a word? \n\n   Let\'s try ""TOILS"": T O I L S -> but then the fourth letter would be L? No, we need fourth letter S. \n   So T O I S T? Not a word.\n\n   How about ""TAWIS""? Not common.\n\n   Another: ""OWISH""? Not a word.\n\n   Let\'s think: \n     ""FISTS"" -> but S repeats. Pattern: F I S T S? Wait, positions: \n        1: F, 2: I? No, we need position 3 to be I. So: position3 must be I. \n        So ""FISTS"": F I S T S -> \n          position1: F, position2: I, position3: S -> doesn\'t match.\n\n   We need the word to have I at position 3 and S at position 4.\n\n   ""POISY""? Not a word.\n\n   ""BLIST"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""GUIST""? Not common.\n\n   ""JOIST"": \n        J O I S T -> \n        positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> matches.\n\n   ""MOIST"": M O I S T -> same pattern.\n\n   ""HOIST"": H O I S T.\n\n   ""FOIST"": F O I S T.\n\n   ""DUIST""? Not a word.\n\n   So common words: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.\n\n   Let\'s choose one that uses letters we haven\'t tried? \n\n   For JOIST: \n     Letters: J, O, I, S, T -> but I and S are already known. So we test J, O, T.\n\n   Similarly for MOIST: M, O, T.\n\n   We want to cover more ground? So let\'s choose a word that has common letters we haven\'t tried, such as T and O? \n\n   Also, note the first guess only tested R,A,I,S,E. So we haven\'t tested O, T, etc.\n\n   But wait: we also know the word doesn\'t have R, A, E. \n\n   We can choose ""MOIST"": \n        M O I S T\n\n   Why this? \n     - We are testing M, O, T in new positions.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose ""TWIST"": T W I S T -> but note, TWIST uses T twice? So we wouldn\'t get information about T if it\'s duplicated? \n   Also, W is less common. \n\n   Let me consider: \n        T is in positions 1 and 5? That might not be optimal because we get two T\'s at once? But if T is in the word, then we might get a ✓ for one or both? \n        However, we don\'t know if T is present. So using two T\'s might be inefficient? \n\n   So ""MOIST"" is better because all letters are distinct? And we test three new letters: M, O, T.\n\n   We might also consider ""TOUIS"" -> not a word.\n\n   Another common one: ""CHIPS"" -> C H I P S -> position1:C,2:H,3:I,4:P,5:S -> doesn\'t fit because position4 is P, not S.\n\n   So ""MOIST"" seems a valid candidate.\n\n   However, note that the fifth letter is T. We haven\'t tested T before. \n\n   Alternatively, ""FOIST"" has F and O and T.\n\n   Let me look for words that have the pattern and also include common consonants that we haven\'t tried: like T, O, N, etc.\n\n   What about ""OPSIS""? -> O P S I S -> but then position3 is S? No, we need I at position3.\n\n   How about ""BOLIS""? -> B O L I S -> position5? No pattern ? We need fourth to be S? Actually: \n        Position: 1:B,2:O,3:L (should be I) -> doesn\'t match.\n\n   Let\'s stick to the words we found: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.\n\n   Let me choose ""MOIST"" because M and O are relatively common.\n\n   We must also consider that if the word has only one S, then our guess must have S only in position4? Or if there\'s another S, that\'s okay? \n\n   The feedback from RAISE said position4: S(✓) but it doesn\'t tell about other positions? So we don\'t know if there are duplicate S? \n\n   But our pattern requires position4 as S, so we know at least one S is there.\n\n   In MOIST: we are putting S only at position4? So if the secret word has an S elsewhere, we might get a \'-\' for that? But in MOIST there isn\'t another S? \n\n   MOIST: M,O,I,S,T -> one S.\n\n   So if the secret word has another S, we won\'t detect it? But we don\'t care for now? We are just trying to get more information.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use a word that has another letter in the fifth position that we haven\'t tested? \n\n   But MOIST seems acceptable.\n\n   However, note: what if the secret word is ""CHIKS""? -> no, but we haven\'t thought of K? \n\n   I think MOIST is a good candidate.\n\n   Let me check if ""MOIST"" is an accepted word? Yes, it means slightly damp, and it\'s accepted in Wordle.\n\n   So we guess: MOIST\n\n   If we get feedback:\n     We know that I and S are correct and in position. So we expect ✓ at position3 and ✓ at position4? Always? But what about duplicated letters? \n        In this case, MOIST doesn\'t duplicate any letters? \n\n   However, if the secret word has a double letter, we haven\'t accounted for it? But in the first guess we didn\'t have any indication of duplication? \n\n   Also, we avoid R,A,E? So MOIST doesn\'t have R,A,E.\n\n   So I\'ll go with MOIST.\n\n   But note: what if the secret word is ""BLISS""? \n        Pattern: _ _ I S S -> because fourth is S and fifth is S? \n        Then our MOIST: \n            position1: M vs B? \n            position2: O vs L?\n            position5: T vs S?\n\n        Then feedback:\n            M: x (if secret is BLISS, then M is not in word)\n            O: x (O not in word? BLISS has B,L,I,S,S -> no O and no M, and T is also absent? But T might be? Wait: secret has B,L,I,S,S -> letters: B,L,I,S)\n            I: ✓ (correct)\n            S: ✓ (correct? because position4? yes, but note there are two S? The feedback for S in MOIST: \n                The first S in MOIST is at position4? That matches. The secret word has S at position4 and position5? \n            T: x (not in word)\n\n        So feedback would be: M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(✓), T(x)\n\n        Then we\'d know only positions 3 and 4 are correct? And letters M,O,T are absent? \n\n        But we already know O? Then we can infer the last letter? \n\n        However, if we guess MOIST and get that, we\'d know the word is ? ? I S ? which cannot be R,A,E and now also cannot be M,O,T? \n\n        So then we have letters in positions: \n          Position3: I (fixed), Position4: S (fixed)\n          Position1: must be not R,A,E,M,O,T? \n          Position2: same constraints? \n          Position5: not R,A,E,M,O,T\n\n        And the word must contain I and S and whatever other letters? \n\n        Alternatively, if the word is BLISS, then we\'ll get the above feedback. But we don\'t know the fifth letter? \n\n        After guessing MOIST, if we get M and O and T as absent, then we can try words like ""BLISS"" or ""FLOSS""? But FLOSS: F L O S S -> O is absent? Not allowed? \n\n        Wait: our feedback would show O as absent? So we can\'t use O? So in the next guess, we try? \n\n        Position5: since T is absent? So we need a letter that isn\'t R,A,E,M,O,T? \n\n        And the first letter isn\'t R,A,E,M,O,T? \n\n        So BLISS: B and L and S? But S we already know? \n\n        We can try ""BLISS"" as a guess? But we have two S? \n\n        Actually, we are building information.\n\n   Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a different set of letters? \n\n   Another candidate: ""THINS"" -> T H I N S -> but then we need fourth letter to be S? \n        Positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:S -> doesn\'t work because fourth is N? Not S.\n\n   So no.\n\n   Another: ""TOILS"" -> T O I L S -> positions: 1:T,2:O,3:I,4:L,5:S -> again, fourth is L? Not S.\n\n   So we stick with the pattern _ _ I S _.\n\n   Another word: ""KUISH"" -> not common? \n\n   Maybe ""QUIPUS""? too long.\n\n   So I think MOIST is acceptable.\n\n   Let\'s go with that.\n\n   Guess: MOIST\n\n   But wait: there is another word ""WAIFS"" doesn\'t fit.\n\n   Considered words: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.\n\n   Why not HOIST? H is also a common letter? \n   HOIST: H O I S T -> same pattern.\n\n   But M is less common than H? Actually, H and M both are common? \n\n   I think either is fine. Let me pick MOIST arbitrarily.\n\n   Alternatively, to maximize coverage of common letters? We could choose one with T? \n\n   Since T is a very common letter, having T in the fifth position? So MOIST tests T? \n\n   We can also consider that the secret word might end with T? \n\n   So MOIST is good.\n\n   Final decision: MOIST.### Thought Process\nAfter analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- ""I"" is in the correct position (3rd letter) ➡️ Must appear in position 3 of the secret word.\n- ""S"" is in the correct position (4th letter) ➡️ Must appear in position 4 of the secret word.\n- ""R"", ""A"", and ""E"" are absent ➡️ Cannot appear anywhere in the secret word.\n\nThe secret word pattern is: _ _ **I** **S** _  \n- Position 3: ""I""  \n- Position 4: ""S""  \n- Positions 1, 2, and 5: Unknown letters (excluding R, A, E).  \n\n### Strategy for Second Guess\n1. **Prioritize common letters**: Test new frequent consonants (e.g., T, O, M, H) to gain information.  \n2. **Fit the pattern**: Guess must include ""I"" at position 3 and ""S"" at position 4.  \n3. **Avoid excluded letters**: No R, A, or E.  \n4. **Consider word candidates**: Valid English words fitting `_ _ I S _`.

We are on the third guess. The feedback so far:

Guess 1: RAISE
  R: absent (x)
  A: absent (x)
  I: correct (✓) at position 3
  S: correct (✓) at position 4
  E: absent (x)

Guess 2: MOIST
  M: absent (x)
  O: absent (x)
  I: correct (✓) at position 3
  S: correct (✓) at position 4
  T: absent (x)

So, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ I S _
- The letters I and S are fixed at positions 3 and 4.
- The absent letters are: R, A, E, M, O, T. So we must avoid these.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] [letter2] I S [letter5]
where letter1, letter2, letter5 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding R, A, E, M, O, T.

The remaining letters are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word that fits this pattern and uses only these letters.

We also want to maximize information. Since we have three positions to guess, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and use only the allowed letters.

Possible words:
- We need words of the form: ? ? I S ?

Some candidates:
- BLISS: B L I S S -> but S is repeated? And we have S at position 4, so if the word has S at position 5, that's allowed? But we don't know if S is duplicated. However, in our feedback, for MOIST, we had S at position 4 correct, but we don't have information about other S's. But note: in the first guess, we had S only at position 4 and it was correct, but that doesn't rule out another S. Similarly, in MOIST, we had S at position 4 and no other S, so if the secret word has two S's, we wouldn't know.

But in BLISS, the pattern is: B L I S S -> so positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:I, 4:S, 5:S. This fits the pattern.

But we must check if B and L are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.

Similarly, other words:
- CHIPS: C H I P S -> but position 4 is P? No, we need position 4 to be S. So not.

- We need position 4 to be S, so the word must end with S? No, position 4 is the fourth letter, and the fifth is separate. So the word is ? ? I S ?.

Another candidate: ""THIS"" is 4 letters, too short.

""KIWIS"": K I W I S -> but position 3 is W? No, we need position 3 to be I. So: 
  Position1: K, position2: I? But then position3 would be W? That's not I. So no.

We need position3 to be I, so the third letter must be I.

Another: ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> but A is absent (from first guess), so not allowed.

""WAIFS"": W A I F S -> A is absent.

""FLIPS"": F L I P S -> position4 is P? No.

""BLIPS"": B L I P S -> same, position4 is P.

""SNIPS"": S N I P S -> position4 is P? No.

But note: we need position4 to be S? How about words that have S at position4? 

Actually, the pattern is fixed: ... I S _ so the fourth letter is S, and the fifth is something.

So words ending with ""IS"" followed by a letter? No, the ""IS"" is positions 3 and 4, so the word ends with ""S"" at position4 and then a fifth letter.

So the structure is: [consonant] [consonant] I S [vowel or consonant]

But we don't have vowels left? We have U as a vowel? And Y sometimes.

The absent vowels: A, E, O. So we have I (which is already placed) and U, and sometimes Y.

So possible vowels for letter5: U, Y? And consonants.

Let's think of words:

- ""BUILS""? Not a word.

- ""BUIST""? But T is absent.

- ""GUISE"": G U I S E -> but E is absent.

- ""JUISE""? Not a word.

- ""LUIS"" is 4 letters.

- ""QUIPS"": Q U I P S -> position4 is P? No.

- ""QUITS"": Q U I T S -> position4 is T? No, we need S at position4.

- ""WHISK"": W H I S K -> 
  Position1: W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:S, 5:K -> this fits the pattern.

WHISK is a word! And it uses W, H, K, which are allowed.

Similarly, ""BLISS"": B L I S S -> as above.

""CHINS"" is C H I N S -> position4 is N? No.

""SHINS"": S H I N S -> position4 is N? No.

""SKINS"": S K I N S -> position4 is N? No.

""SPINS"": S P I N S -> position4 is N? No.

""THINS"": T H I N S -> but T is absent.

""WINNS""? Not a word.

""FLISS""? Not common.

""GLYPH""? Not matching pattern.

So far, we have:
- WHISK: W H I S K
- BLISS: B L I S S

Also, ""SWISS"": S W I S S -> but position1: S, position2: W, position3: I, position4: S, position5: S. This fits? 
  But we have S at position1? We don't know if S is duplicated? And S is already known to be at position4. But we haven't tested S at other positions? 

However, in the first guess, we had S at position4 and it was correct, but we didn't have S at other positions? So it's possible.

But note: in the feedback for RAISE, we had S at position4 correct, but that doesn't tell us about other S's. Similarly, in MOIST, we had S at position4 and no other S, so if the secret word has S at position1, we would get a different feedback? 

But in our current pattern, we are only requiring position4 to be S. So SWISS is a candidate? 

But let's check the letters: S, W, I, S, S. We know I and S are in the word. W is new? And S at position1 and 5? 

But we must avoid the absent letters: R,A,E,M,O,T. S is not absent? So it's allowed.

But we have two candidates: WHISK and BLISS and SWISS.

Another: ""BRISK"": B R I S K -> but R is absent? From first guess, R is absent. So not allowed.

""CRISP"": C R I S P -> R absent.

""DRIPS"": D R I P S -> R absent.

""GRIPS"": G R I P S -> R absent.

""PRISM"": P R I S M -> R absent.

So no.

""FLITS"": F L I T S -> T absent.

""SLITS"": S L I T S -> T absent.

""SPITS"": S P I T S -> T absent.

So WHISK, BLISS, SWISS are candidates.

Also, ""CHISS""? Not a word.

""PHISH"": P H I S H -> 
  Position1: P, 2:H, 3:I, 4:S, 5:H -> fits? And H is repeated? But allowed? 
  PHISH is a word? It might be accepted? But let's see: it's a proper name? But in word games, sometimes accepted? 

But let's stick to common words.

Another: ""WHISP"": W H I S P -> position5: P? 
  WHISP is a word? It might be rare. 

But WHISK is better.

Also, ""BLISH""? Not a word.

So let's list the candidates we have:
1. WHISK: W, H, I, S, K -> tests W, H, K (all new)
2. BLISS: B, L, I, S, S -> tests B, L, and has double S? So we test B and L, but S is repeated? 
3. SWISS: S, W, I, S, S -> tests W, and has triple S? 

We want to maximize information. 

If we guess WHISK:
  - We test three new letters: W, H, K.
  - If any of them are in the word, we get feedback.

If we guess BLISS:
  - We test B and L (and we see if there is a second S? but we already know S is in the word, so if we get a ✓ for the last S, then we know there is a second S? But the feedback for the last S might be '-' if it's in the word but wrong position? Or if it's in the word and in the correct position? 

But note: in BLISS, the last letter is S. If the secret word has S at position5, then we get ✓ for that S? But if the secret word does not have S at position5, but has S elsewhere? But we already have S at position4? So if there is only one S, then the last S in BLISS would be absent? But if there are two S's, then the last S might be correct or misplaced? 

But the pattern requires position4 to be S, so if there is a second S, it must be at position1,2, or5? 

In our case, for BLISS, if we guess and the secret word is, say, WHISK, then:
  Position1: B vs W -> absent (x)
  Position2: L vs H -> absent (x)
  Position3: I ✓
  Position4: S ✓
  Position5: S vs K -> absent (x) because K is not S? 

But if the secret word is BLISS, then:
  Position1: B ✓
  Position2: L ✓
  Position3: I ✓
  Position4: S ✓
  Position5: S ✓

So we win.

Similarly, if we guess WHISK and the secret is BLISS, then:
  Position1: W vs B -> absent (x)
  Position2: H vs L -> absent (x)
  Position3: I ✓
  Position4: S ✓
  Position5: K vs S -> absent (x)

Then we get the same feedback? So we wouldn't know which one? 

But we have other candidates? 

We need to distinguish between the candidates.

But we have more than two? We also have SWISS? 

SWISS: S W I S S

If secret is BLISS: 
  Position1: S vs B -> absent? But S is in the word? But at position1? The secret BLISS has B at position1, so S would be absent? But wait: 
  The secret word BLISS has letters: B, L, I, S, S. 
  In SWISS: 
    Position1: S -> the secret has no S at position1? But it has S at position4 and 5? So the S at position1 in SWISS is not in the secret? But the secret has S, so it should be marked as present but wrong position? 

Feedback rules:
  If the letter is in the word but not in that position, it's marked with '-'.

So for SWISS vs BLISS:
  Position1: S -> the secret has S, but not at position1? So it should be '-'. 
  Position2: W -> the secret has no W? So absent (x)
  Position3: I -> ✓
  Position4: S -> ✓ (correct position)
  Position5: S -> the secret has S at position5? So ✓? 

But the secret BLISS has two S's: at position4 and 5. So when we guess SWISS:
  Position1: S is present in the word? But not at position1? So we mark it with '-'? 
  Then position5: S is at the correct position? So ✓.

But the secret has two S's? So the first S in SWISS (position1) is not in the secret at position1, but the secret has S at position4 and 5? So the first S in SWISS is a misplaced S? 

But the secret has two S's: one at position4 and one at position5. The guess SWISS has three S's? So we have to compare:

Secret: B L I S S
Guess:  S W I S S

For the first S in guess: 
  The secret has S at position4 and 5? But we haven't assigned any feedback yet? 
  We start from left: 
    Position1: S -> the secret has S at position4 and 5? So it is present, but not at position1? So we mark it with '-'. 
    Then we mark the S at position4: it matches the secret's position4? So ✓. 
    Then position5: it matches the secret's position5? So ✓. 
  But we have two S's in the secret? And we have used one for the first S (misplaced) and one for position4? But then the position5 S in the guess should also be compared? 

Actually, the rule is: 
  First, mark the exact matches (correct position). 
  Then, for the remaining, mark the ones that are in the word but not in the correct position, but only as many as there are in the secret.

In this case:
  Step 1: mark exact matches:
    Position3: I ✓
    Position4: S ✓
    Position5: S ✓ (because secret has S at position5? But wait, the secret has S at position4 and 5? So position5 is also correct? 
  So we mark position3,4,5 as ✓.

  Then, for position1: S -> the secret has two S's, but both are already matched at position4 and 5? So there is no extra S? So it should be absent? 

But that doesn't seem right? 

Actually, the standard Wordle rule: 
  The feedback is given per letter, but the total count of the letter in the feedback must match the count in the secret.

In secret BLISS: two S's.
In guess SWISS: three S's.

We first mark the exact matches: 
  Position3: I -> ✓
  Position4: S -> ✓ (one S matched)
  Position5: S -> ✓ (second S matched)

Then, for position1: S -> there are no more S's in the secret? So it should be marked as absent (x). 
Position2: W -> absent (x).

So feedback: S(-) would be wrong? It should be S(x) for position1? 

But that seems inconsistent? 

Actually, no: because the two S's in the secret are already matched at positions 4 and 5. So the S at position1 in the guess is extra and not present? So it should be marked absent.

Therefore, for SWISS vs BLISS: 
  Position1: S (x) because no unmatched S left in secret? 
  Position2: W (x)
  Position3: I (✓)
  Position4: S (✓)
  Position5: S (✓)

But that would be: S(x) W(x) I(✓) S(✓) S(✓)

But that is the same as if we guessed WHISK and the secret was BLISS? 
  WHISK: W(x) H(x) I(✓) S(✓) K(x) -> but K(x) and then S(✓) at position4? 
  Actually, for WHISK: 
      Position1: W (x) 
      Position2: H (x)
      Position3: I (✓)
      Position4: S (✓)
      Position5: K (x)

So both guesses (WHISK and SWISS) would give two x's at the beginning, then two ✓ and then one x? But for SWISS, the last is ✓? 

No, for SWISS vs BLISS: 
  We have: position1: x, position2: x, position3: ✓, position4: ✓, position5: ✓ -> so three ✓ at the end.

For WHISK vs BLISS: 
  position1: x, position2: x, position3: ✓, position4: ✓, position5: x -> so only two ✓.

So they are different.

But in our case, we are guessing to find the word. 

We have three candidates: WHISK, BLISS, SWISS.

We need a guess that can help us distinguish.

But we have to make one guess. 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are at guess 3.

We can choose a word that uses letters that are common in the candidates? 

But the candidates have different letters.

We can list the possible letters for each position.

Position1: must be a letter not in {R,A,E,M,O,T} and not I,S (since I and S are fixed at 3 and 4). So from: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Similarly for position2 and position5.

But we know the word must contain I and S (already placed), and possibly other letters.

Now, from the candidates:
- WHISK: W at1, H at2, K at5
- BLISS: B at1, L at2, S at5
- SWISS: S at1, W at2, S at5

But note: in SWISS, position5 is S, so if we guess a word that has a different letter at5, we can test.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

We could guess a word that has new letters to cover more ground.

For example, we haven't tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use a word that has, say, B, L, and W? But we need to fit the pattern.

What word? ""BLIWS""? Not a word.

""BLOWS"": B L O W S -> but O is absent? And position4 is W? No.

We need position4 to be S? So not.

Another idea: guess a word that has a double letter? But we don't know.

Perhaps we can choose ""WHISK"" as the guess because it uses three new letters and no duplicates.

If we guess WHISK and the feedback is:
  If the secret is WHISK: we win.
  If the secret is BLISS: then we get W(x) H(x) I(✓) S(✓) K(x) -> so we know the word is not WHISK, and then we can guess BLISS or SWISS next? 
  But then we have two candidates left? 

But if we get that feedback, we know the secret has no W, H, K? So then the secret must be BLISS or SWISS? 

But for BLISS: it has B, L, and S (with two S's). 
For SWISS: it has S, W, and S (but W is now absent? because we got W(x) in WHISK? So if we got W(x) from WHISK, then SWISS is invalid because it has W? 

So if we guess WHISK and get W(x) and H(x) and K(x), then the secret cannot have W, H, K? 

Then the only candidate left is BLISS? Because SWISS has W, which would be absent? 

Similarly, if we get W present? Then it might be SWISS? 

But let's see:

Case 1: Secret is WHISK
  Guess WHISK: all ✓ -> win.

Case 2: Secret is BLISS
  Guess WHISK: 
      W: absent (x) because BLISS has no W
      H: absent (x) 
      I: ✓
      S: ✓
      K: absent (x) 
  So feedback: x x ✓ ✓ x

  Then we know the secret has no W, H, K? And the pattern is _ _ I S _ 
  Then the only candidate is BLISS? Because SWISS has W, which is absent? So we can guess BLISS next.

Case 3: Secret is SWISS
  Guess WHISK:
      Position1: W vs S -> W is not in SWISS? Wait, SWISS has W at position2? 
      So:
        Position1: W -> the secret SWISS has W? But not at position1? So it should be marked as present but wrong position? 
        But we have to check: 
          Secret: S W I S S
          Guess:  W H I S K
        Step 1: mark exact matches:
            Position3: I ✓
            Position4: S ✓
        Step 2: for the W at position1: the secret has W at position2? So it is present? Mark as '-'.
        Position2: H -> the secret has no H? So absent (x)
        Position5: K -> absent (x)
        So feedback: W(-) H(x) I(✓) S(✓) K(x)

  Then we know: 
      W is in the word but not at position1? 
      H and K are absent.
      I and S are correct at positions 3 and 4.

  Then the secret must have W? And the pattern is _ _ I S _ 
  And we know W is in the word? But not at position1? So it must be at position2 or 5? 

  But position5: we don't know? 

  Then we can try to guess a word that has W at position2? 

  For example, SWISS: S W I S S -> which fits? 

  But we have to avoid H and K? 

  So we can guess SWISS next.

So by guessing WHISK, we can distinguish:

- If we get all ✓, done.
- If we get x x ✓ ✓ x, then secret is BLISS.
- If we get - x ✓ ✓ x, then secret is SWISS (or another word with W? but we don't have other candidates? 

But what if there is another word? For example, ""ENNIS""? But E is absent.

Or ""INNIS""? Not a word.

""ILIAD""? Not matching pattern.

So probably the only candidates are WHISK, BLISS, SWISS.

Therefore, guessing WHISK is a good move because it covers three new letters and helps us distinguish the candidates.

We can also consider that if we guess BLISS and it's not correct, we get information? 

But if we guess BLISS and the secret is WHISK, we get:
  B(x) L(x) I(✓) S(✓) S(x) -> because the secret WHISK has no B, L, and only one S? 
  Then we know the secret has no B, L? And the last S is absent? So then we can guess WHISK next? 

But we are using two guesses? 

Similarly, if we guess SWISS and the secret is BLISS, we get:
  S (if at position1: but secret has B, so S is not at position1? But secret has S at position4 and 5? So S at position1 in guess is present? But not at position1? So '-'. 
  W: absent? 
  I: ✓
  S: ✓ (position4)
  S: at position5: the secret has S at position5? So ✓? 
  But wait: secret BLISS: B L I S S
  guess SWISS: S W I S S
  Feedback: 
      Position1: S -> present but not at1? Because secret has S at4 and5? So '-'
      Position2: W -> absent (x)
      Position3: I ✓
      Position4: S ✓
      Position5: S ✓
  So we get: S(-) W(x) I(✓) S(✓) S(✓)

  Then we know: 
      S is in the word but not at position1? 
      W is absent.
      I and S at positions 3 and 4 are correct, and S at position5 is correct? 
      But then the secret must have S at position5? 
      And the pattern is _ _ I S S? 
      And we know the first letter is not S? Because we have S at position1 in the guess and it's not at1? But it could be at position2? 
      But the pattern is [not S] [letter2] I S S? 
      And we know letter2 is not W? 

  Then we can guess BLISS? 

But it's a bit messy.

So to save guesses, WHISK is a better guess because it tests three new letters and we can then guess the word in the next turn.

Therefore, I choose to guess WHISK.

<guess>WHISK</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → R(absent), A(absent), I(correct position), S(correct position), E(absent)  
  - This confirms:  
    - **I** is in position 3.  
    - **S** is in position 4.  
    - R, A, E are **absent** from the word.  

- **Guess 2: MOIST** → M(absent), O(absent), I(correct position), S(correct position), T(absent)  
  - This confirms:  
    - **I** (position 3) and **S** (position 4) remain fixed.  
    - M, O, T are **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word pattern is: **`_ _ I S _`** (positions 3 and 4 are fixed as **I** and **S**).  
- **Absent letters**: R, A, E, M, O, T (cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize testing high-frequency unused letters (e.g., H, W, L, K) to maximize information.  
- Choose a valid word that fits the pattern `_ _ I S _` and uses only allowed letters.  
- **Top candidate words**:  
  - **WHISK** (tests W, H, K — all new letters).  
  - **BLISS** (tests B, L, and potential double-S).  
  - **SWISS** (tests S at new positions and W).  
- **Why WHISK?**  
  - Tests 3 new common letters (W, H, K).  
  - Helps distinguish between top candidates:  
    - If **WHISK** is correct, we win.  
    - If feedback shows W/H/K absent, **BLISS** becomes likely.  
    - If feedback shows W present (but misplaced), **SWISS** becomes likely.  

<guess>WHISK</guess>",WHISK,"We are on the third guess. The feedback so far:

Guess 1: RAISE
  R: absent (x)
  A: absent (x)
  I: correct (✓) at position 3
  S: correct (✓) at position 4
  E: absent (x)

Guess 2: MOIST
  M: absent (x)
  O: absent (x)
  I: correct (✓) at position 3
  S: correct (✓) at position 4
  T: absent (x)

So, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ I S _
- The letters I and S are fixed at positions 3 and 4.
- The absent letters are: R, A, E, M, O, T. So we must avoid these.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] [letter2] I S [letter5]
where letter1, letter2, letter5 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding R, A, E, M, O, T.

The remaining letters are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word that fits this pattern and uses only these letters.

We also want to maximize information. Since we have three positions to guess, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and use only the allowed letters.

Possible words:
- We need words of the form: ? ? I S ?

Some candidates:
- BLISS: B L I S S -> but S is repeated? And we have S at position 4, so if the word has S at position 5, that's allowed? But we don't know if S is duplicated. However, in our feedback, for MOIST, we had S at position 4 correct, but we don't have information about other S's. But note: in the first guess, we had S only at position 4 and it was correct, but that doesn't rule out another S. Similarly, in MOIST, we had S at position 4 and no other S, so if the secret word has two S's, we wouldn't know.

But in BLISS, the pattern is: B L I S S -> so positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:I, 4:S, 5:S. This fits the pattern.

But we must check if B and L are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.

Similarly, other words:
- CHIPS: C H I P S -> but position 4 is P? No, we need position 4 to be S. So not.

- We need position 4 to be S, so the word must end with S? No, position 4 is the fourth letter, and the fifth is separate. So the word is ? ? I S ?.

Another candidate: ""THIS"" is 4 letters, too short.

""KIWIS"": K I W I S -> but position 3 is W? No, we need position 3 to be I. So: 
  Position1: K, position2: I? But then position3 would be W? That's not I. So no.

We need position3 to be I, so the third letter must be I.

Another: ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> but A is absent (from first guess), so not allowed.

""WAIFS"": W A I F S -> A is absent.

""FLIPS"": F L I P S -> position4 is P? No.

""BLIPS"": B L I P S -> same, position4 is P.

""SNIPS"": S N I P S -> position4 is P? No.

But note: we need position4 to be S? How about words that have S at position4? 

Actually, the pattern is fixed: ... I S _ so the fourth letter is S, and the fifth is something.

So words ending with ""IS"" followed by a letter? No, the ""IS"" is positions 3 and 4, so the word ends with ""S"" at position4 and then a fifth letter.

So the structure is: [consonant] [consonant] I S [vowel or consonant]

But we don't have vowels left? We have U as a vowel? And Y sometimes.

The absent vowels: A, E, O. So we have I (which is already placed) and U, and sometimes Y.

So possible vowels for letter5: U, Y? And consonants.

Let's think of words:

- ""BUILS""? Not a word.

- ""BUIST""? But T is absent.

- ""GUISE"": G U I S E -> but E is absent.

- ""JUISE""? Not a word.

- ""LUIS"" is 4 letters.

- ""QUIPS"": Q U I P S -> position4 is P? No.

- ""QUITS"": Q U I T S -> position4 is T? No, we need S at position4.

- ""WHISK"": W H I S K -> 
  Position1: W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:S, 5:K -> this fits the pattern.

WHISK is a word! And it uses W, H, K, which are allowed.

Similarly, ""BLISS"": B L I S S -> as above.

""CHINS"" is C H I N S -> position4 is N? No.

""SHINS"": S H I N S -> position4 is N? No.

""SKINS"": S K I N S -> position4 is N? No.

""SPINS"": S P I N S -> position4 is N? No.

""THINS"": T H I N S -> but T is absent.

""WINNS""? Not a word.

""FLISS""? Not common.

""GLYPH""? Not matching pattern.

So far, we have:
- WHISK: W H I S K
- BLISS: B L I S S

Also, ""SWISS"": S W I S S -> but position1: S, position2: W, position3: I, position4: S, position5: S. This fits? 
  But we have S at position1? We don't know if S is duplicated? And S is already known to be at position4. But we haven't tested S at other positions? 

However, in the first guess, we had S at position4 and it was correct, but we didn't have S at other positions? So it's possible.

But note: in the feedback for RAISE, we had S at position4 correct, but that doesn't tell us about other S's. Similarly, in MOIST, we had S at position4 and no other S, so if the secret word has S at position1, we would get a different feedback? 

But in our current pattern, we are only requiring position4 to be S. So SWISS is a candidate? 

But let's check the letters: S, W, I, S, S. We know I and S are in the word. W is new? And S at position1 and 5? 

But we must avoid the absent letters: R,A,E,M,O,T. S is not absent? So it's allowed.

But we have two candidates: WHISK and BLISS and SWISS.

Another: ""BRISK"": B R I S K -> but R is absent? From first guess, R is absent. So not allowed.

""CRISP"": C R I S P -> R absent.

""DRIPS"": D R I P S -> R absent.

""GRIPS"": G R I P S -> R absent.

""PRISM"": P R I S M -> R absent.

So no.

""FLITS"": F L I T S -> T absent.

""SLITS"": S L I T S -> T absent.

""SPITS"": S P I T S -> T absent.

So WHISK, BLISS, SWISS are candidates.

Also, ""CHISS""? Not a word.

""PHISH"": P H I S H -> 
  Position1: P, 2:H, 3:I, 4:S, 5:H -> fits? And H is repeated? But allowed? 
  PHISH is a word? It might be accepted? But let's see: it's a proper name? But in word games, sometimes accepted? 

But let's stick to common words.

Another: ""WHISP"": W H I S P -> position5: P? 
  WHISP is a word? It might be rare. 

But WHISK is better.

Also, ""BLISH""? Not a word.

So let's list the candidates we have:
1. WHISK: W, H, I, S, K -> tests W, H, K (all new)
2. BLISS: B, L, I, S, S -> tests B, L, and has double S? So we test B and L, but S is repeated? 
3. SWISS: S, W, I, S, S -> tests W, and has triple S? 

We want to maximize information. 

If we guess WHISK:
  - We test three new letters: W, H, K.
  - If any of them are in the word, we get feedback.

If we guess BLISS:
  - We test B and L (and we see if there is a second S? but we already know S is in the word, so if we get a ✓ for the last S, then we know there is a second S? But the feedback for the last S might be '-' if it's in the word but wrong position? Or if it's in the word and in the correct position? 

But note: in BLISS, the last letter is S. If the secret word has S at position5, then we get ✓ for that S? But if the secret word does not have S at position5, but has S elsewhere? But we already have S at position4? So if there is only one S, then the last S in BLISS would be absent? But if there are two S's, then the last S might be correct or misplaced? 

But the pattern requires position4 to be S, so if there is a second S, it must be at position1,2, or5? 

In our case, for BLISS, if we guess and the secret word is, say, WHISK, then:
  Position1: B vs W -> absent (x)
  Position2: L vs H -> absent (x)
  Position3: I ✓
  Position4: S ✓
  Position5: S vs K -> absent (x) because K is not S? 

But if the secret word is BLISS, then:
  Position1: B ✓
  Position2: L ✓
  Position3: I ✓
  Position4: S ✓
  Position5: S ✓

So we win.

Similarly, if we guess WHISK and the secret is BLISS, then:
  Position1: W vs B -> absent (x)
  Position2: H vs L -> absent (x)
  Position3: I ✓
  Position4: S ✓
  Position5: K vs S -> absent (x)

Then we get the same feedback? So we wouldn't know which one? 

But we have other candidates? 

We need to distinguish between the candidates.

But we have more than two? We also have SWISS? 

SWISS: S W I S S

If secret is BLISS: 
  Position1: S vs B -> absent? But S is in the word? But at position1? The secret BLISS has B at position1, so S would be absent? But wait: 
  The secret word BLISS has letters: B, L, I, S, S. 
  In SWISS: 
    Position1: S -> the secret has no S at position1? But it has S at position4 and 5? So the S at position1 in SWISS is not in the secret? But the secret has S, so it should be marked as present but wrong position? 

Feedback rules:
  If the letter is in the word but not in that position, it's marked with '-'.

So for SWISS vs BLISS:
  Position1: S -> the secret has S, but not at position1? So it should be '-'. 
  Position2: W -> the secret has no W? So absent (x)
  Position3: I -> ✓
  Position4: S -> ✓ (correct position)
  Position5: S -> the secret has S at position5? So ✓? 

But the secret BLISS has two S's: at position4 and 5. So when we guess SWISS:
  Position1: S is present in the word? But not at position1? So we mark it with '-'? 
  Then position5: S is at the correct position? So ✓.

But the secret has two S's? So the first S in SWISS (position1) is not in the secret at position1, but the secret has S at position4 and 5? So the first S in SWISS is a misplaced S? 

But the secret has two S's: one at position4 and one at position5. The guess SWISS has three S's? So we have to compare:

Secret: B L I S S
Guess:  S W I S S

For the first S in guess: 
  The secret has S at position4 and 5? But we haven't assigned any feedback yet? 
  We start from left: 
    Position1: S -> the secret has S at position4 and 5? So it is present, but not at position1? So we mark it with '-'. 
    Then we mark the S at position4: it matches the secret's position4? So ✓. 
    Then position5: it matches the secret's position5? So ✓. 
  But we have two S's in the secret? And we have used one for the first S (misplaced) and one for position4? But then the position5 S in the guess should also be compared? 

Actually, the rule is: 
  First, mark the exact matches (correct position). 
  Then, for the remaining, mark the ones that are in the word but not in the correct position, but only as many as there are in the secret.

In this case:
  Step 1: mark exact matches:
    Position3: I ✓
    Position4: S ✓
    Position5: S ✓ (because secret has S at position5? But wait, the secret has S at position4 and 5? So position5 is also correct? 
  So we mark position3,4,5 as ✓.

  Then, for position1: S -> the secret has two S's, but both are already matched at position4 and 5? So there is no extra S? So it should be absent? 

But that doesn't seem right? 

Actually, the standard Wordle rule: 
  The feedback is given per letter, but the total count of the letter in the feedback must match the count in the secret.

In secret BLISS: two S's.
In guess SWISS: three S's.

We first mark the exact matches: 
  Position3: I -> ✓
  Position4: S -> ✓ (one S matched)
  Position5: S -> ✓ (second S matched)

Then, for position1: S -> there are no more S's in the secret? So it should be marked as absent (x). 
Position2: W -> absent (x).

So feedback: S(-) would be wrong? It should be S(x) for position1? 

But that seems inconsistent? 

Actually, no: because the two S's in the secret are already matched at positions 4 and 5. So the S at position1 in the guess is extra and not present? So it should be marked absent.

Therefore, for SWISS vs BLISS: 
  Position1: S (x) because no unmatched S left in secret? 
  Position2: W (x)
  Position3: I (✓)
  Position4: S (✓)
  Position5: S (✓)

But that would be: S(x) W(x) I(✓) S(✓) S(✓)

But that is the same as if we guessed WHISK and the secret was BLISS? 
  WHISK: W(x) H(x) I(✓) S(✓) K(x) -> but K(x) and then S(✓) at position4? 
  Actually, for WHISK: 
      Position1: W (x) 
      Position2: H (x)
      Position3: I (✓)
      Position4: S (✓)
      Position5: K (x)

So both guesses (WHISK and SWISS) would give two x's at the beginning, then two ✓ and then one x? But for SWISS, the last is ✓? 

No, for SWISS vs BLISS: 
  We have: position1: x, position2: x, position3: ✓, position4: ✓, position5: ✓ -> so three ✓ at the end.

For WHISK vs BLISS: 
  position1: x, position2: x, position3: ✓, position4: ✓, position5: x -> so only two ✓.

So they are different.

But in our case, we are guessing to find the word. 

We have three candidates: WHISK, BLISS, SWISS.

We need a guess that can help us distinguish.

But we have to make one guess. 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are at guess 3.

We can choose a word that uses letters that are common in the candidates? 

But the candidates have different letters.

We can list the possible letters for each position.

Position1: must be a letter not in {R,A,E,M,O,T} and not I,S (since I and S are fixed at 3 and 4). So from: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Similarly for position2 and position5.

But we know the word must contain I and S (already placed), and possibly other letters.

Now, from the candidates:
- WHISK: W at1, H at2, K at5
- BLISS: B at1, L at2, S at5
- SWISS: S at1, W at2, S at5

But note: in SWISS, position5 is S, so if we guess a word that has a different letter at5, we can test.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

We could guess a word that has new letters to cover more ground.

For example, we haven't tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use a word that has, say, B, L, and W? But we need to fit the pattern.

What word? ""BLIWS""? Not a word.

""BLOWS"": B L O W S -> but O is absent? And position4 is W? No.

We need position4 to be S? So not.

Another idea: guess a word that has a double letter? But we don't know.

Perhaps we can choose ""WHISK"" as the guess because it uses three new letters and no duplicates.

If we guess WHISK and the feedback is:
  If the secret is WHISK: we win.
  If the secret is BLISS: then we get W(x) H(x) I(✓) S(✓) K(x) -> so we know the word is not WHISK, and then we can guess BLISS or SWISS next? 
  But then we have two candidates left? 

But if we get that feedback, we know the secret has no W, H, K? So then the secret must be BLISS or SWISS? 

But for BLISS: it has B, L, and S (with two S's). 
For SWISS: it has S, W, and S (but W is now absent? because we got W(x) in WHISK? So if we got W(x) from WHISK, then SWISS is invalid because it has W? 

So if we guess WHISK and get W(x) and H(x) and K(x), then the secret cannot have W, H, K? 

Then the only candidate left is BLISS? Because SWISS has W, which would be absent? 

Similarly, if we get W present? Then it might be SWISS? 

But let's see:

Case 1: Secret is WHISK
  Guess WHISK: all ✓ -> win.

Case 2: Secret is BLISS
  Guess WHISK: 
      W: absent (x) because BLISS has no W
      H: absent (x) 
      I: ✓
      S: ✓
      K: absent (x) 
  So feedback: x x ✓ ✓ x

  Then we know the secret has no W, H, K? And the pattern is _ _ I S _ 
  Then the only candidate is BLISS? Because SWISS has W, which is absent? So we can guess BLISS next.

Case 3: Secret is SWISS
  Guess WHISK:
      Position1: W vs S -> W is not in SWISS? Wait, SWISS has W at position2? 
      So:
        Position1: W -> the secret SWISS has W? But not at position1? So it should be marked as present but wrong position? 
        But we have to check: 
          Secret: S W I S S
          Guess:  W H I S K
        Step 1: mark exact matches:
            Position3: I ✓
            Position4: S ✓
        Step 2: for the W at position1: the secret has W at position2? So it is present? Mark as '-'.
        Position2: H -> the secret has no H? So absent (x)
        Position5: K -> absent (x)
        So feedback: W(-) H(x) I(✓) S(✓) K(x)

  Then we know: 
      W is in the word but not at position1? 
      H and K are absent.
      I and S are correct at positions 3 and 4.

  Then the secret must have W? And the pattern is _ _ I S _ 
  And we know W is in the word? But not at position1? So it must be at position2 or 5? 

  But position5: we don't know? 

  Then we can try to guess a word that has W at position2? 

  For example, SWISS: S W I S S -> which fits? 

  But we have to avoid H and K? 

  So we can guess SWISS next.

So by guessing WHISK, we can distinguish:

- If we get all ✓, done.
- If we get x x ✓ ✓ x, then secret is BLISS.
- If we get - x ✓ ✓ x, then secret is SWISS (or another word with W? but we don't have other candidates? 

But what if there is another word? For example, ""ENNIS""? But E is absent.

Or ""INNIS""? Not a word.

""ILIAD""? Not matching pattern.

So probably the only candidates are WHISK, BLISS, SWISS.

Therefore, guessing WHISK is a good move because it covers three new letters and helps us distinguish the candidates.

We can also consider that if we guess BLISS and it's not correct, we get information? 

But if we guess BLISS and the secret is WHISK, we get:
  B(x) L(x) I(✓) S(✓) S(x) -> because the secret WHISK has no B, L, and only one S? 
  Then we know the secret has no B, L? And the last S is absent? So then we can guess WHISK next? 

But we are using two guesses? 

Similarly, if we guess SWISS and the secret is BLISS, we get:
  S (if at position1: but secret has B, so S is not at position1? But secret has S at position4 and 5? So S at position1 in guess is present? But not at position1? So '-'. 
  W: absent? 
  I: ✓
  S: ✓ (position4)
  S: at position5: the secret has S at position5? So ✓? 
  But wait: secret BLISS: B L I S S
  guess SWISS: S W I S S
  Feedback: 
      Position1: S -> present but not at1? Because secret has S at4 and5? So '-'
      Position2: W -> absent (x)
      Position3: I ✓
      Position4: S ✓
      Position5: S ✓
  So we get: S(-) W(x) I(✓) S(✓) S(✓)

  Then we know: 
      S is in the word but not at position1? 
      W is absent.
      I and S at positions 3 and 4 are correct, and S at position5 is correct? 
      But then the secret must have S at position5? 
      And the pattern is _ _ I S S? 
      And we know the first letter is not S? Because we have S at position1 in the guess and it's not at1? But it could be at position2? 
      But the pattern is [not S] [letter2] I S S? 
      And we know letter2 is not W? 

  Then we can guess BLISS? 

But it's a bit messy.

So to save guesses, WHISK is a better guess because it tests three new letters and we can then guess the word in the next turn.

Therefore, I choose to guess WHISK.

<guess>WHISK</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → R(absent), A(absent), I(correct position), S(correct position), E(absent)  
  - This confirms:  
    - **I** is in position 3.  
    - **S** is in position 4.  
    - R, A, E are **absent** from the word.  

- **Guess 2: MOIST** → M(absent), O(absent), I(correct position), S(correct position), T(absent)  
  - This confirms:  
    - **I** (position 3) and **S** (position 4) remain fixed.  
    - M, O, T are **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word pattern is: **`_ _ I S _`** (positions 3 and 4 are fixed as **I** and **S**).  
- **Absent letters**: R, A, E, M, O, T (cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize testing high-frequency unused letters (e.g., H, W, L, K) to maximize information.  
- Choose a valid word that fits the pattern `_ _ I S _` and uses only allowed letters.  
- **Top candidate words**:  
  - **WHISK** (tests W, H, K — all new letters).  
  - **BLISS** (tests B, L, and potential double-S).  
  - **SWISS** (tests S at new positions and W).  
- **Why WHISK?**  
  - Tests 3 new common letters (W, H, K).  
  - Helps distinguish between top candidates:  
    - If **WHISK** is correct, we win.  
    - If feedback shows W/H/K absent, **BLISS** becomes likely.  
    - If feedback shows W present (but misplaced), **SWISS** becomes likely.",Guess 3: WHISK -> FEEDBACK: W(-) H(-) I(✓) S(✓) K(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,SWISH,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since it's the first guess, we have no prior information.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common letters and vowels to maximize the information we get.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

 Let me choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 So, my first guess will be: RAISE<thought>
As this is the first guess in Wordle, I need to choose a word that maximizes information gain. The ideal starting word should:
- Contain common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) since most words have vowels
- Include frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N) 
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more unique characters
- Have balanced letter distribution

""RAISE"" is a strong starting choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E)
- Includes two high-frequency consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique (no duplicates)
- It's a common English word accepted in word games

This guess will provide valuable feedback about:
- Presence/absence of critical vowels (A, I, E)
- Information about consonants (R, S)
- Positional accuracy for these letters

The feedback will help narrow down possible solutions for subsequent guesses.
</thought>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on our second guess. The previous feedback for ""RAISE"" was:
 R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)

 This means:
 - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)
 - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)
 - R, A, and E are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has the letter 'I' as the third letter and 'S' as the fourth letter.
 Also, it does not contain R, A, or E.

 Since the word is 5 letters, we know the positions:
   _ _ I S _

 Now, we need to make a guess that:
   - Has 'I' in the third position and 'S' in the fourth position.
   - Avoids using R, A, E.

 We also want to use common letters that haven't been tested yet to gather more information.

 Possible letters for the other positions: avoid R, A, E.

 Common consonants that might appear: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we don't have any correct first or last letters, we should try to cover frequent consonants.

 We can try to form words that fit the pattern _ _ I S _

 Examples: 
   TWIST (T,W,I,S,T) -> but T is repeated, and we don't know if T is in the word? Also, the last letter is T, which we haven't tested.
   OOPS? Not 5 letters.

 Let's think of words that end with S? But wait, we know S is in the fourth position, so the last letter is something else.

 Actually, the word must end with a letter we haven't tested, and the pattern is _ _ I S _ -> so the last letter is the fifth.

 Words matching: [letter1][letter2]I S [letter5]

 We don't know letter1, letter2, letter5.

 We must avoid R, A, E.

 Let me recall common words: 
   ""QUITS"" -> Q is not very common? Also, avoids R,A,E? But Q and U: U is a vowel, but not forbidden because we only know R,A,E are absent. But let's see: 
   But Q and U often come together. However, our pattern: Q U I T S -> third letter I and fourth S? Wait: 
     Position1: Q, Position2: U, Position3: I, Position4: T, Position5: S -> but we need fourth position to be S? So that doesn't fit.

 Actually, we require the fourth letter to be S. So the word is ? ? I S ? 

 Examples:
   BLISS: B L I S S -> but S repeats? And we have S in the fourth and fifth? But our pattern: position4 is S, and position5 would be S? That's possible? 
   However, we have feedback only that S is in the word and in position 4. It doesn't say anything about duplicate S? We must be cautious.

   The feedback for RAISE: S was in position 4 and we got ✓ meaning that the secret word has S in position 4. So the word has at least one S. 
   But it might have more? 

   However, we know that the word has the letter I in position 3 and S in position 4. 

   Other words: 
     ""TWIST"": T W I S T -> positions: 
        1: T, 2: W, 3: I, 4: S, 5: T -> fits the pattern? 
        But note: we haven't tested T and W. And we must avoid A, R, E? Yes. So it's a candidate.

   Another: ""THIS"" is only 4 letters. 
   ""CHISM"" -> not a word? 

   Let's try ""TOILS"": T O I L S -> but then the fourth letter would be L? No, we need fourth letter S. 
   So T O I S T? Not a word.

   How about ""TAWIS""? Not common.

   Another: ""OWISH""? Not a word.

   Let's think: 
     ""FISTS"" -> but S repeats. Pattern: F I S T S? Wait, positions: 
        1: F, 2: I? No, we need position 3 to be I. So: position3 must be I. 
        So ""FISTS"": F I S T S -> 
          position1: F, position2: I, position3: S -> doesn't match.

   We need the word to have I at position 3 and S at position 4.

   ""POISY""? Not a word.

   ""BLIST"" -> not a word.

   ""GUIST""? Not common.

   ""JOIST"": 
        J O I S T -> 
        positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> matches.

   ""MOIST"": M O I S T -> same pattern.

   ""HOIST"": H O I S T.

   ""FOIST"": F O I S T.

   ""DUIST""? Not a word.

   So common words: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.

   Let's choose one that uses letters we haven't tried? 

   For JOIST: 
     Letters: J, O, I, S, T -> but I and S are already known. So we test J, O, T.

   Similarly for MOIST: M, O, T.

   We want to cover more ground? So let's choose a word that has common letters we haven't tried, such as T and O? 

   Also, note the first guess only tested R,A,I,S,E. So we haven't tested O, T, etc.

   But wait: we also know the word doesn't have R, A, E. 

   We can choose ""MOIST"": 
        M O I S T

   Why this? 
     - We are testing M, O, T in new positions.

   Alternatively, we can choose ""TWIST"": T W I S T -> but note, TWIST uses T twice? So we wouldn't get information about T if it's duplicated? 
   Also, W is less common. 

   Let me consider: 
        T is in positions 1 and 5? That might not be optimal because we get two T's at once? But if T is in the word, then we might get a ✓ for one or both? 
        However, we don't know if T is present. So using two T's might be inefficient? 

   So ""MOIST"" is better because all letters are distinct? And we test three new letters: M, O, T.

   We might also consider ""TOUIS"" -> not a word.

   Another common one: ""CHIPS"" -> C H I P S -> position1:C,2:H,3:I,4:P,5:S -> doesn't fit because position4 is P, not S.

   So ""MOIST"" seems a valid candidate.

   However, note that the fifth letter is T. We haven't tested T before. 

   Alternatively, ""FOIST"" has F and O and T.

   Let me look for words that have the pattern and also include common consonants that we haven't tried: like T, O, N, etc.

   What about ""OPSIS""? -> O P S I S -> but then position3 is S? No, we need I at position3.

   How about ""BOLIS""? -> B O L I S -> position5? No pattern ? We need fourth to be S? Actually: 
        Position: 1:B,2:O,3:L (should be I) -> doesn't match.

   Let's stick to the words we found: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.

   Let me choose ""MOIST"" because M and O are relatively common.

   We must also consider that if the word has only one S, then our guess must have S only in position4? Or if there's another S, that's okay? 

   The feedback from RAISE said position4: S(✓) but it doesn't tell about other positions? So we don't know if there are duplicate S? 

   But our pattern requires position4 as S, so we know at least one S is there.

   In MOIST: we are putting S only at position4? So if the secret word has an S elsewhere, we might get a '-' for that? But in MOIST there isn't another S? 

   MOIST: M,O,I,S,T -> one S.

   So if the secret word has another S, we won't detect it? But we don't care for now? We are just trying to get more information.

   Alternatively, we could use a word that has another letter in the fifth position that we haven't tested? 

   But MOIST seems acceptable.

   However, note: what if the secret word is ""CHIKS""? -> no, but we haven't thought of K? 

   I think MOIST is a good candidate.

   Let me check if ""MOIST"" is an accepted word? Yes, it means slightly damp, and it's accepted in Wordle.

   So we guess: MOIST

   If we get feedback:
     We know that I and S are correct and in position. So we expect ✓ at position3 and ✓ at position4? Always? But what about duplicated letters? 
        In this case, MOIST doesn't duplicate any letters? 

   However, if the secret word has a double letter, we haven't accounted for it? But in the first guess we didn't have any indication of duplication? 

   Also, we avoid R,A,E? So MOIST doesn't have R,A,E.

   So I'll go with MOIST.

   But note: what if the secret word is ""BLISS""? 
        Pattern: _ _ I S S -> because fourth is S and fifth is S? 
        Then our MOIST: 
            position1: M vs B? 
            position2: O vs L?
            position5: T vs S?

        Then feedback:
            M: x (if secret is BLISS, then M is not in word)
            O: x (O not in word? BLISS has B,L,I,S,S -> no O and no M, and T is also absent? But T might be? Wait: secret has B,L,I,S,S -> letters: B,L,I,S)
            I: ✓ (correct)
            S: ✓ (correct? because position4? yes, but note there are two S? The feedback for S in MOIST: 
                The first S in MOIST is at position4? That matches. The secret word has S at position4 and position5? 
            T: x (not in word)

        So feedback would be: M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(✓), T(x)

        Then we'd know only positions 3 and 4 are correct? And letters M,O,T are absent? 

        But we already know O? Then we can infer the last letter? 

        However, if we guess MOIST and get that, we'd know the word is ? ? I S ? which cannot be R,A,E and now also cannot be M,O,T? 

        So then we have letters in positions: 
          Position3: I (fixed), Position4: S (fixed)
          Position1: must be not R,A,E,M,O,T? 
          Position2: same constraints? 
          Position5: not R,A,E,M,O,T

        And the word must contain I and S and whatever other letters? 

        Alternatively, if the word is BLISS, then we'll get the above feedback. But we don't know the fifth letter? 

        After guessing MOIST, if we get M and O and T as absent, then we can try words like ""BLISS"" or ""FLOSS""? But FLOSS: F L O S S -> O is absent? Not allowed? 

        Wait: our feedback would show O as absent? So we can't use O? So in the next guess, we try? 

        Position5: since T is absent? So we need a letter that isn't R,A,E,M,O,T? 

        And the first letter isn't R,A,E,M,O,T? 

        So BLISS: B and L and S? But S we already know? 

        We can try ""BLISS"" as a guess? But we have two S? 

        Actually, we are building information.

   Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a different set of letters? 

   Another candidate: ""THINS"" -> T H I N S -> but then we need fourth letter to be S? 
        Positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:S -> doesn't work because fourth is N? Not S.

   So no.

   Another: ""TOILS"" -> T O I L S -> positions: 1:T,2:O,3:I,4:L,5:S -> again, fourth is L? Not S.

   So we stick with the pattern _ _ I S _.

   Another word: ""KUISH"" -> not common? 

   Maybe ""QUIPUS""? too long.

   So I think MOIST is acceptable.

   Let's go with that.

   Guess: MOIST

   But wait: there is another word ""WAIFS"" doesn't fit.

   Considered words: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.

   Why not HOIST? H is also a common letter? 
   HOIST: H O I S T -> same pattern.

   But M is less common than H? Actually, H and M both are common? 

   I think either is fine. Let me pick MOIST arbitrarily.

   Alternatively, to maximize coverage of common letters? We could choose one with T? 

   Since T is a very common letter, having T in the fifth position? So MOIST tests T? 

   We can also consider that the secret word might end with T? 

   So MOIST is good.

   Final decision: MOIST.### Thought Process
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- ""I"" is in the correct position (3rd letter) ➡️ Must appear in position 3 of the secret word.
- ""S"" is in the correct position (4th letter) ➡️ Must appear in position 4 of the secret word.
- ""R"", ""A"", and ""E"" are absent ➡️ Cannot appear anywhere in the secret word.

The secret word pattern is: _ _ **I** **S** _  
- Position 3: ""I""  
- Position 4: ""S""  
- Positions 1, 2, and 5: Unknown letters (excluding R, A, E).  

### Strategy for Second Guess
1. **Prioritize common letters**: Test new frequent consonants (e.g., T, O, M, H) to gain information.  
2. **Fit the pattern**: Guess must include ""I"" at position 3 and ""S"" at position 4.  
3. **Avoid excluded letters**: No R, A, or E.  
4. **Consider word candidates**: Valid English words fitting `_ _ I S _`. Strong options include:  
   - **MOIST** (M, O, I, S, T) → Tests M, O, T (all new letters)  
   - HOIST (H, O, I, S, T) → Tests H, O, T  
   - FOIST (F, O, I, S, T) → Tests F, O, T  
   - JOIST (J, O, I, S, T) → Tests J, O, T  

**Why choose ""MOIST""?**  
- Uses distinct common letters (M, O, T) not tested yet.  
- High information potential: Reveals presence/absence of M/O/T and their positions.  
- Validates if the 5th letter could be T (a common word ending).  

If ""MOIST"" is incorrect, feedback will help narrow options further (e.g., confirming M/O/T inclusion or exclusion).

<guess>MOIST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the third guess. The feedback so far:

Guess 1: RAISE
  R: absent (x)
  A: absent (x)
  I: correct (✓) at position 3
  S: correct (✓) at position 4
  E: absent (x)

Guess 2: MOIST
  M: absent (x)
  O: absent (x)
  I: correct (✓) at position 3
  S: correct (✓) at position 4
  T: absent (x)

So, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ I S _
- The letters I and S are fixed at positions 3 and 4.
- The absent letters are: R, A, E, M, O, T. So we must avoid these.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] [letter2] I S [letter5]
where letter1, letter2, letter5 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding R, A, E, M, O, T.

The remaining letters are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word that fits this pattern and uses only these letters.

We also want to maximize information. Since we have three positions to guess, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and use only the allowed letters.

Possible words:
- We need words of the form: ? ? I S ?

Some candidates:
- BLISS: B L I S S -> but S is repeated? And we have S at position 4, so if the word has S at position 5, that's allowed? But we don't know if S is duplicated. However, in our feedback, for MOIST, we had S at position 4 correct, but we don't have information about other S's. But note: in the first guess, we had S only at position 4 and it was correct, but that doesn't rule out another S. Similarly, in MOIST, we had S at position 4 and no other S, so if the secret word has two S's, we wouldn't know.

But in BLISS, the pattern is: B L I S S -> so positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:I, 4:S, 5:S. This fits the pattern.

But we must check if B and L are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.

Similarly, other words:
- CHIPS: C H I P S -> but position 4 is P? No, we need position 4 to be S. So not.

- We need position 4 to be S, so the word must end with S? No, position 4 is the fourth letter, and the fifth is separate. So the word is ? ? I S ?.

Another candidate: ""THIS"" is 4 letters, too short.

""KIWIS"": K I W I S -> but position 3 is W? No, we need position 3 to be I. So: 
  Position1: K, position2: I? But then position3 would be W? That's not I. So no.

We need position3 to be I, so the third letter must be I.

Another: ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> but A is absent (from first guess), so not allowed.

""WAIFS"": W A I F S -> A is absent.

""FLIPS"": F L I P S -> position4 is P? No.

""BLIPS"": B L I P S -> same, position4 is P.

""SNIPS"": S N I P S -> position4 is P? No.

But note: we need position4 to be S? How about words that have S at position4? 

Actually, the pattern is fixed: ... I S _ so the fourth letter is S, and the fifth is something.

So words ending with ""IS"" followed by a letter? No, the ""IS"" is positions 3 and 4, so the word ends with ""S"" at position4 and then a fifth letter.

So the structure is: [consonant] [consonant] I S [vowel or consonant]

But we don't have vowels left? We have U as a vowel? And Y sometimes.

The absent vowels: A, E, O. So we have I (which is already placed) and U, and sometimes Y.

So possible vowels for letter5: U, Y? And consonants.

Let's think of words:

- ""BUILS""? Not a word.

- ""BUIST""? But T is absent.

- ""GUISE"": G U I S E -> but E is absent.

- ""JUISE""? Not a word.

- ""LUIS"" is 4 letters.

- ""QUIPS"": Q U I P S -> position4 is P? No.

- ""QUITS"": Q U I T S -> position4 is T? No, we need S at position4.

- ""WHISK"": W H I S K -> 
  Position1: W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:S, 5:K -> this fits the pattern.

WHISK is a word! And it uses W, H, K, which are allowed.

Similarly, ""BLISS"": B L I S S -> as above.

""CHINS"" is C H I N S -> position4 is N? No.

""SHINS"": S H I N S -> position4 is N? No.

""SKINS"": S K I N S -> position4 is N? No.

""SPINS"": S P I N S -> position4 is N? No.

""THINS"": T H I N S -> but T is absent.

""WINNS""? Not a word.

""FLISS""? Not common.

""GLYPH""? Not matching pattern.

So far, we have:
- WHISK: W H I S K
- BLISS: B L I S S

Also, ""SWISS"": S W I S S -> but position1: S, position2: W, position3: I, position4: S, position5: S. This fits? 
  But we have S at position1? We don't know if S is duplicated? And S is already known to be at position4. But we haven't tested S at other positions? 

However, in the first guess, we had S at position4 and it was correct, but we didn't have S at other positions? So it's possible.

But note: in the feedback for RAISE, we had S at position4 correct, but that doesn't tell us about other S's. Similarly, in MOIST, we had S at position4 and no other S, so if the secret word has S at position1, we would get a different feedback? 

But in our current pattern, we are only requiring position4 to be S. So SWISS is a candidate? 

But let's check the letters: S, W, I, S, S. We know I and S are in the word. W is new? And S at position1 and 5? 

But we must avoid the absent letters: R,A,E,M,O,T. S is not absent? So it's allowed.

But we have two candidates: WHISK and BLISS and SWISS.

Another: ""BRISK"": B R I S K -> but R is absent? From first guess, R is absent. So not allowed.

""CRISP"": C R I S P -> R absent.

""DRIPS"": D R I P S -> R absent.

""GRIPS"": G R I P S -> R absent.

""PRISM"": P R I S M -> R absent.

So no.

""FLITS"": F L I T S -> T absent.

""SLITS"": S L I T S -> T absent.

""SPITS"": S P I T S -> T absent.

So WHISK, BLISS, SWISS are candidates.

Also, ""CHISS""? Not a word.

""PHISH"": P H I S H -> 
  Position1: P, 2:H, 3:I, 4:S, 5:H -> fits? And H is repeated? But allowed? 
  PHISH is a word? It might be accepted? But let's see: it's a proper name? But in word games, sometimes accepted? 

But let's stick to common words.

Another: ""WHISP"": W H I S P -> position5: P? 
  WHISP is a word? It might be rare. 

But WHISK is better.

Also, ""BLISH""? Not a word.

So let's list the candidates we have:
1. WHISK: W, H, I, S, K -> tests W, H, K (all new)
2. BLISS: B, L, I, S, S -> tests B, L, and has double S? So we test B and L, but S is repeated? 
3. SWISS: S, W, I, S, S -> tests W, and has triple S? 

We want to maximize information. 

If we guess WHISK:
  - We test three new letters: W, H, K.
  - If any of them are in the word, we get feedback.

If we guess BLISS:
  - We test B and L (and we see if there is a second S? but we already know S is in the word, so if we get a ✓ for the last S, then we know there is a second S? But the feedback for the last S might be '-' if it's in the word but wrong position? Or if it's in the word and in the correct position? 

But note: in BLISS, the last letter is S. If the secret word has S at position5, then we get ✓ for that S? But if the secret word does not have S at position5, but has S elsewhere? But we already have S at position4? So if there is only one S, then the last S in BLISS would be absent? But if there are two S's, then the last S might be correct or misplaced? 

But the pattern requires position4 to be S, so if there is a second S, it must be at position1,2, or5? 

In our case, for BLISS, if we guess and the secret word is, say, WHISK, then:
  Position1: B vs W -> absent (x)
  Position2: L vs H -> absent (x)
  Position3: I ✓
  Position4: S ✓
  Position5: S vs K -> absent (x) because K is not S? 

But if the secret word is BLISS, then:
  Position1: B ✓
  Position2: L ✓
  Position3: I ✓
  Position4: S ✓
  Position5: S ✓

So we win.

Similarly, if we guess WHISK and the secret is BLISS, then:
  Position1: W vs B -> absent (x)
  Position2: H vs L -> absent (x)
  Position3: I ✓
  Position4: S ✓
  Position5: K vs S -> absent (x)

Then we get the same feedback? So we wouldn't know which one? 

But we have other candidates? 

We need to distinguish between the candidates.

But we have more than two? We also have SWISS? 

SWISS: S W I S S

If secret is BLISS: 
  Position1: S vs B -> absent? But S is in the word? But at position1? The secret BLISS has B at position1, so S would be absent? But wait: 
  The secret word BLISS has letters: B, L, I, S, S. 
  In SWISS: 
    Position1: S -> the secret has no S at position1? But it has S at position4 and 5? So the S at position1 in SWISS is not in the secret? But the secret has S, so it should be marked as present but wrong position? 

Feedback rules:
  If the letter is in the word but not in that position, it's marked with '-'.

So for SWISS vs BLISS:
  Position1: S -> the secret has S, but not at position1? So it should be '-'. 
  Position2: W -> the secret has no W? So absent (x)
  Position3: I -> ✓
  Position4: S -> ✓ (correct position)
  Position5: S -> the secret has S at position5? So ✓? 

But the secret BLISS has two S's: at position4 and 5. So when we guess SWISS:
  Position1: S is present in the word? But not at position1? So we mark it with '-'? 
  Then position5: S is at the correct position? So ✓.

But the secret has two S's? So the first S in SWISS (position1) is not in the secret at position1, but the secret has S at position4 and 5? So the first S in SWISS is a misplaced S? 

But the secret has two S's: one at position4 and one at position5. The guess SWISS has three S's? So we have to compare:

Secret: B L I S S
Guess:  S W I S S

For the first S in guess: 
  The secret has S at position4 and 5? But we haven't assigned any feedback yet? 
  We start from left: 
    Position1: S -> the secret has S at position4 and 5? So it is present, but not at position1? So we mark it with '-'. 
    Then we mark the S at position4: it matches the secret's position4? So ✓. 
    Then position5: it matches the secret's position5? So ✓. 
  But we have two S's in the secret? And we have used one for the first S (misplaced) and one for position4? But then the position5 S in the guess should also be compared? 

Actually, the rule is: 
  First, mark the exact matches (correct position). 
  Then, for the remaining, mark the ones that are in the word but not in the correct position, but only as many as there are in the secret.

In this case:
  Step 1: mark exact matches:
    Position3: I ✓
    Position4: S ✓
    Position5: S ✓ (because secret has S at position5? But wait, the secret has S at position4 and 5? So position5 is also correct? 
  So we mark position3,4,5 as ✓.

  Then, for position1: S -> the secret has two S's, but both are already matched at position4 and 5? So there is no extra S? So it should be absent? 

But that doesn't seem right? 

Actually, the standard Wordle rule: 
  The feedback is given per letter, but the total count of the letter in the feedback must match the count in the secret.

In secret BLISS: two S's.
In guess SWISS: three S's.

We first mark the exact matches: 
  Position3: I -> ✓
  Position4: S -> ✓ (one S matched)
  Position5: S -> ✓ (second S matched)

Then, for position1: S -> there are no more S's in the secret? So it should be marked as absent (x). 
Position2: W -> absent (x).

So feedback: S(-) would be wrong? It should be S(x) for position1? 

But that seems inconsistent? 

Actually, no: because the two S's in the secret are already matched at positions 4 and 5. So the S at position1 in the guess is extra and not present? So it should be marked absent.

Therefore, for SWISS vs BLISS: 
  Position1: S (x) because no unmatched S left in secret? 
  Position2: W (x)
  Position3: I (✓)
  Position4: S (✓)
  Position5: S (✓)

But that would be: S(x) W(x) I(✓) S(✓) S(✓)

But that is the same as if we guessed WHISK and the secret was BLISS? 
  WHISK: W(x) H(x) I(✓) S(✓) K(x) -> but K(x) and then S(✓) at position4? 
  Actually, for WHISK: 
      Position1: W (x) 
      Position2: H (x)
      Position3: I (✓)
      Position4: S (✓)
      Position5: K (x)

So both guesses (WHISK and SWISS) would give two x's at the beginning, then two ✓ and then one x? But for SWISS, the last is ✓? 

No, for SWISS vs BLISS: 
  We have: position1: x, position2: x, position3: ✓, position4: ✓, position5: ✓ -> so three ✓ at the end.

For WHISK vs BLISS: 
  position1: x, position2: x, position3: ✓, position4: ✓, position5: x -> so only two ✓.

So they are different.

But in our case, we are guessing to find the word. 

We have three candidates: WHISK, BLISS, SWISS.

We need a guess that can help us distinguish.

But we have to make one guess. 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are at guess 3.

We can choose a word that uses letters that are common in the candidates? 

But the candidates have different letters.

We can list the possible letters for each position.

Position1: must be a letter not in {R,A,E,M,O,T} and not I,S (since I and S are fixed at 3 and 4). So from: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Similarly for position2 and position5.

But we know the word must contain I and S (already placed), and possibly other letters.

Now, from the candidates:
- WHISK: W at1, H at2, K at5
- BLISS: B at1, L at2, S at5
- SWISS: S at1, W at2, S at5

But note: in SWISS, position5 is S, so if we guess a word that has a different letter at5, we can test.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

We could guess a word that has new letters to cover more ground.

For example, we haven't tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use a word that has, say, B, L, and W? But we need to fit the pattern.

What word? ""BLIWS""? Not a word.

""BLOWS"": B L O W S -> but O is absent? And position4 is W? No.

We need position4 to be S? So not.

Another idea: guess a word that has a double letter? But we don't know.

Perhaps we can choose ""WHISK"" as the guess because it uses three new letters and no duplicates.

If we guess WHISK and the feedback is:
  If the secret is WHISK: we win.
  If the secret is BLISS: then we get W(x) H(x) I(✓) S(✓) K(x) -> so we know the word is not WHISK, and then we can guess BLISS or SWISS next? 
  But then we have two candidates left? 

But if we get that feedback, we know the secret has no W, H, K? So then the secret must be BLISS or SWISS? 

But for BLISS: it has B, L, and S (with two S's). 
For SWISS: it has S, W, and S (but W is now absent? because we got W(x) in WHISK? So if we got W(x) from WHISK, then SWISS is invalid because it has W? 

So if we guess WHISK and get W(x) and H(x) and K(x), then the secret cannot have W, H, K? 

Then the only candidate left is BLISS? Because SWISS has W, which would be absent? 

Similarly, if we get W present? Then it might be SWISS? 

But let's see:

Case 1: Secret is WHISK
  Guess WHISK: all ✓ -> win.

Case 2: Secret is BLISS
  Guess WHISK: 
      W: absent (x) because BLISS has no W
      H: absent (x) 
      I: ✓
      S: ✓
      K: absent (x) 
  So feedback: x x ✓ ✓ x

  Then we know the secret has no W, H, K? And the pattern is _ _ I S _ 
  Then the only candidate is BLISS? Because SWISS has W, which is absent? So we can guess BLISS next.

Case 3: Secret is SWISS
  Guess WHISK:
      Position1: W vs S -> W is not in SWISS? Wait, SWISS has W at position2? 
      So:
        Position1: W -> the secret SWISS has W? But not at position1? So it should be marked as present but wrong position? 
        But we have to check: 
          Secret: S W I S S
          Guess:  W H I S K
        Step 1: mark exact matches:
            Position3: I ✓
            Position4: S ✓
        Step 2: for the W at position1: the secret has W at position2? So it is present? Mark as '-'.
        Position2: H -> the secret has no H? So absent (x)
        Position5: K -> absent (x)
        So feedback: W(-) H(x) I(✓) S(✓) K(x)

  Then we know: 
      W is in the word but not at position1? 
      H and K are absent.
      I and S are correct at positions 3 and 4.

  Then the secret must have W? And the pattern is _ _ I S _ 
  And we know W is in the word? But not at position1? So it must be at position2 or 5? 

  But position5: we don't know? 

  Then we can try to guess a word that has W at position2? 

  For example, SWISS: S W I S S -> which fits? 

  But we have to avoid H and K? 

  So we can guess SWISS next.

So by guessing WHISK, we can distinguish:

- If we get all ✓, done.
- If we get x x ✓ ✓ x, then secret is BLISS.
- If we get - x ✓ ✓ x, then secret is SWISS (or another word with W? but we don't have other candidates? 

But what if there is another word? For example, ""ENNIS""? But E is absent.

Or ""INNIS""? Not a word.

""ILIAD""? Not matching pattern.

So probably the only candidates are WHISK, BLISS, SWISS.

Therefore, guessing WHISK is a good move because it covers three new letters and helps us distinguish the candidates.

We can also consider that if we guess BLISS and it's not correct, we get information? 

But if we guess BLISS and the secret is WHISK, we get:
  B(x) L(x) I(✓) S(✓) S(x) -> because the secret WHISK has no B, L, and only one S? 
  Then we know the secret has no B, L? And the last S is absent? So then we can guess WHISK next? 

But we are using two guesses? 

Similarly, if we guess SWISS and the secret is BLISS, we get:
  S (if at position1: but secret has B, so S is not at position1? But secret has S at position4 and 5? So S at position1 in guess is present? But not at position1? So '-'. 
  W: absent? 
  I: ✓
  S: ✓ (position4)
  S: at position5: the secret has S at position5? So ✓? 
  But wait: secret BLISS: B L I S S
  guess SWISS: S W I S S
  Feedback: 
      Position1: S -> present but not at1? Because secret has S at4 and5? So '-'
      Position2: W -> absent (x)
      Position3: I ✓
      Position4: S ✓
      Position5: S ✓
  So we get: S(-) W(x) I(✓) S(✓) S(✓)

  Then we know: 
      S is in the word but not at position1? 
      W is absent.
      I and S at positions 3 and 4 are correct, and S at position5 is correct? 
      But then the secret must have S at position5? 
      And the pattern is _ _ I S S? 
      And we know the first letter is not S? Because we have S at position1 in the guess and it's not at1? But it could be at position2? 
      But the pattern is [not S] [letter2] I S S? 
      And we know letter2 is not W? 

  Then we can guess BLISS? 

But it's a bit messy.

So to save guesses, WHISK is a better guess because it tests three new letters and we can then guess the word in the next turn.

Therefore, I choose to guess WHISK.

<guess>WHISK</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → R(absent), A(absent), I(correct position), S(correct position), E(absent)  
  - This confirms:  
    - **I** is in position 3.  
    - **S** is in position 4.  
    - R, A, E are **absent** from the word.  

- **Guess 2: MOIST** → M(absent), O(absent), I(correct position), S(correct position), T(absent)  
  - This confirms:  
    - **I** (position 3) and **S** (position 4) remain fixed.  
    - M, O, T are **absent**.

- The secret word pattern is: **`_ _ I S _`** (positions 3 and 4 are fixed as **I** and **S**).  
- **Absent letters**: R, A, E, M, O, T (cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Prioritize testing high-frequency unused letters (e.g., H, W, L, K) to maximize information.  
- Choose a valid word that fits the pattern `_ _ I S _` and uses only allowed letters.  
- **Top candidate words**:  
  - **WHISK** (tests W, H, K — all new letters).  
  - **BLISS** (tests B, L, and potential double-S).  
  - **SWISS** (tests S at new positions and W).  
- **Why WHISK?**  
  - Tests 3 new common letters (W, H, K).  
  - Helps distinguish between top candidates:  
    - If **WHISK** is correct, we win.  
    - If feedback shows W/H/K absent, **BLISS** becomes likely.  
    - If feedback shows W present (but misplaced), **SWISS** becomes likely.

The previous feedback for ""RAISE"" was:\n R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)\n\n This means:\n - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)\n - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)\n - R, A, and E are not in the word at all.\n\n So the secret word has the letter \'I\' as the third letter and \'S\' as the fourth letter.\n Also, it does not contain R, A, or E.\n\n Since the word is 5 letters, we know the positions:\n   _ _ I S _\n\n Now, we need to make a guess that:\n   - Has \'I\' in the third position and \'S\' in the fourth position.\n   - Avoids using R, A, E.\n\n We also want to use common letters that haven\'t been tested yet to gather more information.\n\n Possible letters for the other positions: avoid R, A, E.\n\n Common consonants that might appear: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n Since we don\'t have any correct first or last letters, we should try to cover frequent consonants.\n\n We can try to form words that fit the pattern _ _ I S _\n\n Examples: \n   TWIST (T,W,I,S,T) -> but T is repeated, and we don\'t know if T is in the word? Also, the last letter is T, which we haven\'t tested.\n   OOPS? Not 5 letters.\n\n Let\'s think of words that end with S? But wait, we know S is in the fourth position, so the last letter is something else.\n\n Actually, the word must end with a letter we haven\'t tested, and the pattern is _ _ I S _ -> so the last letter is the fifth.\n\n Words matching: [letter1][letter2]I S [letter5]\n\n We don\'t know letter1, letter2, letter5.\n\n We must avoid R, A, E.\n\n Let me recall common words: \n   ""QUITS"" -> Q is not very common? Also, avoids R,A,E? But Q and U: U is a vowel, but not forbidden because we only know R,A,E are absent. But let\'s see: \n   But Q and U often come together. However, our pattern: Q U I T S -> third letter I and fourth S? Wait: \n     Position1: Q, Position2: U, Position3: I, Position4: T, Position5: S -> but we need fourth position to be S? So that doesn\'t fit.\n\n Actually, we require the fourth letter to be S. So the word is ? ? I S ? \n\n Examples:\n   BLISS: B L I S S -> but S repeats? And we have S in the fourth and fifth? But our pattern: position4 is S, and position5 would be S? That\'s possible? \n   However, we have feedback only that S is in the word and in position 4. It doesn\'t say anything about duplicate S? We must be cautious.\n\n   The feedback for RAISE: S was in position 4 and we got ✓ meaning that the secret word has S in position 4. So the word has at least one S. \n   But it might have more? \n\n   However, we know that the word has the letter I in position 3 and S in position 4. \n\n   Other words: \n     ""TWIST"": T W I S T -> positions: \n        1: T, 2: W, 3: I, 4: S, 5: T -> fits the pattern? \n        But note: we haven\'t tested T and W. And we must avoid A, R, E? Yes. So it\'s a candidate.\n\n   Another: ""THIS"" is only 4 letters. \n   ""CHISM"" -> not a word? \n\n   Let\'s try ""TOILS"": T O I L S -> but then the fourth letter would be L? No, we need fourth letter S. \n   So T O I S T? Not a word.\n\n   How about ""TAWIS""? Not common.\n\n   Another: ""OWISH""? Not a word.\n\n   Let\'s think: \n     ""FISTS"" -> but S repeats. Pattern: F I S T S? Wait, positions: \n        1: F, 2: I? No, we need position 3 to be I. So: position3 must be I. \n        So ""FISTS"": F I S T S -> \n          position1: F, position2: I, position3: S -> doesn\'t match.\n\n   We need the word to have I at position 3 and S at position 4.\n\n   ""POISY""? Not a word.\n\n   ""BLIST"" -> not a word.\n\n   ""GUIST""? Not common.\n\n   ""JOIST"": \n        J O I S T -> \n        positions: 1:J, 2:O, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> matches.\n\n   ""MOIST"": M O I S T -> same pattern.\n\n   ""HOIST"": H O I S T.\n\n   ""FOIST"": F O I S T.\n\n   ""DUIST""? Not a word.\n\n   So common words: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.\n\n   Let\'s choose one that uses letters we haven\'t tried? \n\n   For JOIST: \n     Letters: J, O, I, S, T -> but I and S are already known. So we test J, O, T.\n\n   Similarly for MOIST: M, O, T.\n\n   We want to cover more ground? So let\'s choose a word that has common letters we haven\'t tried, such as T and O? \n\n   Also, note the first guess only tested R,A,I,S,E. So we haven\'t tested O, T, etc.\n\n   But wait: we also know the word doesn\'t have R, A, E. \n\n   We can choose ""MOIST"": \n        M O I S T\n\n   Why this? \n     - We are testing M, O, T in new positions.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose ""TWIST"": T W I S T -> but note, TWIST uses T twice? So we wouldn\'t get information about T if it\'s duplicated? \n   Also, W is less common. \n\n   Let me consider: \n        T is in positions 1 and 5? That might not be optimal because we get two T\'s at once? But if T is in the word, then we might get a ✓ for one or both? \n        However, we don\'t know if T is present. So using two T\'s might be inefficient? \n\n   So ""MOIST"" is better because all letters are distinct? And we test three new letters: M, O, T.\n\n   We might also consider ""TOUIS"" -> not a word.\n\n   Another common one: ""CHIPS"" -> C H I P S -> position1:C,2:H,3:I,4:P,5:S -> doesn\'t fit because position4 is P, not S.\n\n   So ""MOIST"" seems a valid candidate.\n\n   However, note that the fifth letter is T. We haven\'t tested T before. \n\n   Alternatively, ""FOIST"" has F and O and T.\n\n   Let me look for words that have the pattern and also include common consonants that we haven\'t tried: like T, O, N, etc.\n\n   What about ""OPSIS""? -> O P S I S -> but then position3 is S? No, we need I at position3.\n\n   How about ""BOLIS""? -> B O L I S -> position5? No pattern ? We need fourth to be S? Actually: \n        Position: 1:B,2:O,3:L (should be I) -> doesn\'t match.\n\n   Let\'s stick to the words we found: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.\n\n   Let me choose ""MOIST"" because M and O are relatively common.\n\n   We must also consider that if the word has only one S, then our guess must have S only in position4? Or if there\'s another S, that\'s okay? \n\n   The feedback from RAISE said position4: S(✓) but it doesn\'t tell about other positions? So we don\'t know if there are duplicate S? \n\n   But our pattern requires position4 as S, so we know at least one S is there.\n\n   In MOIST: we are putting S only at position4? So if the secret word has an S elsewhere, we might get a \'-\' for that? But in MOIST there isn\'t another S? \n\n   MOIST: M,O,I,S,T -> one S.\n\n   So if the secret word has another S, we won\'t detect it? But we don\'t care for now? We are just trying to get more information.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use a word that has another letter in the fifth position that we haven\'t tested? \n\n   But MOIST seems acceptable.\n\n   However, note: what if the secret word is ""CHIKS""? -> no, but we haven\'t thought of K? \n\n   I think MOIST is a good candidate.\n\n   Let me check if ""MOIST"" is an accepted word? Yes, it means slightly damp, and it\'s accepted in Wordle.\n\n   So we guess: MOIST\n\n   If we get feedback:\n     We know that I and S are correct and in position. So we expect ✓ at position3 and ✓ at position4? Always? But what about duplicated letters? \n        In this case, MOIST doesn\'t duplicate any letters? \n\n   However, if the secret word has a double letter, we haven\'t accounted for it? But in the first guess we didn\'t have any indication of duplication? \n\n   Also, we avoid R,A,E? So MOIST doesn\'t have R,A,E.\n\n   So I\'ll go with MOIST.\n\n   But note: what if the secret word is ""BLISS""? \n        Pattern: _ _ I S S -> because fourth is S and fifth is S? \n        Then our MOIST: \n            position1: M vs B? \n            position2: O vs L?\n            position5: T vs S?\n\n        Then feedback:\n            M: x (if secret is BLISS, then M is not in word)\n            O: x (O not in word? BLISS has B,L,I,S,S -> no O and no M, and T is also absent? But T might be? Wait: secret has B,L,I,S,S -> letters: B,L,I,S)\n            I: ✓ (correct)\n            S: ✓ (correct? because position4? yes, but note there are two S? The feedback for S in MOIST: \n                The first S in MOIST is at position4? That matches. The secret word has S at position4 and position5? \n            T: x (not in word)\n\n        So feedback would be: M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(✓), T(x)\n\n        Then we\'d know only positions 3 and 4 are correct? And letters M,O,T are absent? \n\n        But we already know O? Then we can infer the last letter? \n\n        However, if we guess MOIST and get that, we\'d know the word is ? ? I S ? which cannot be R,A,E and now also cannot be M,O,T? \n\n        So then we have letters in positions: \n          Position3: I (fixed), Position4: S (fixed)\n          Position1: must be not R,A,E,M,O,T? \n          Position2: same constraints? \n          Position5: not R,A,E,M,O,T\n\n        And the word must contain I and S and whatever other letters? \n\n        Alternatively, if the word is BLISS, then we\'ll get the above feedback. But we don\'t know the fifth letter? \n\n        After guessing MOIST, if we get M and O and T as absent, then we can try words like ""BLISS"" or ""FLOSS""? But FLOSS: F L O S S -> O is absent? Not allowed? \n\n        Wait: our feedback would show O as absent? So we can\'t use O? So in the next guess, we try? \n\n        Position5: since T is absent? So we need a letter that isn\'t R,A,E,M,O,T? \n\n        And the first letter isn\'t R,A,E,M,O,T? \n\n        So BLISS: B and L and S? But S we already know? \n\n        We can try ""BLISS"" as a guess? But we have two S? \n\n        Actually, we are building information.\n\n   Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a different set of letters? \n\n   Another candidate: ""THINS"" -> T H I N S -> but then we need fourth letter to be S? \n        Positions: 1:T, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:S -> doesn\'t work because fourth is N? Not S.\n\n   So no.\n\n   Another: ""TOILS"" -> T O I L S -> positions: 1:T,2:O,3:I,4:L,5:S -> again, fourth is L? Not S.\n\n   So we stick with the pattern _ _ I S _.\n\n   Another word: ""KUISH"" -> not common? \n\n   Maybe ""QUIPUS""? too long.\n\n   So I think MOIST is acceptable.\n\n   Let\'s go with that.\n\n   Guess: MOIST\n\n   But wait: there is another word ""WAIFS"" doesn\'t fit.\n\n   Considered words: JOIST, MOIST, HOIST, FOIST.\n\n   Why not HOIST? H is also a common letter? \n   HOIST: H O I S T -> same pattern.\n\n   But M is less common than H? Actually, H and M both are common? \n\n   I think either is fine. Let me pick MOIST arbitrarily.\n\n   Alternatively, to maximize coverage of common letters? We could choose one with T? \n\n   Since T is a very common letter, having T in the fifth position? So MOIST tests T? \n\n   We can also consider that the secret word might end with T? \n\n   So MOIST is good.\n\n   Final decision: MOIST.### Thought Process\nAfter analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- ""I"" is in the correct position (3rd letter) ➡️ Must appear in position 3 of the secret word.\n- ""S"" is in the correct position (4th letter) ➡️ Must appear in position 4 of the secret word.\n- ""R"", ""A"", and ""E"" are absent ➡️ Cannot appear anywhere in the secret word.\n\nThe secret word pattern is: _ _ **I** **S** _  \n- Position 3: ""I""  \n- Position 4: ""S""  \n- Positions 1, 2, and 5: Unknown letters (excluding R, A, E).  \n\n### Strategy for Second Guess\n1. **Prioritize common letters**: Test new frequent consonants (e.g., T, O, M, H) to gain information.  \n2. **Fit the pattern**: Guess must include ""I"" at position 3 and ""S"" at position 4.  \n3. **Avoid excluded letters**: No R, A, or E.  \n4. **Consider word candidates**: Valid English words fitting `_ _ I S _`. Strong options include:  \n   - **MOIST** (M, O, I, S, T) → Tests M, O, T (all new letters)  \n   - HOIST (H, O, I, S, T) → Tests H, O, T  \n   - FOIST (F, O, I, S, T) → Tests F, O, T  \n   - JOIST (J, O, I, S, T) → Tests J, O, T  \n\n**Why choose ""MOIST""?**  \n- Uses distinct common letters (M, O, T) not tested yet.  \n- High information potential: Reveals presence/absence of M/O/T and their positions.  \n- Validates if the 5th letter could be T (a common word ending).  \n\nIf ""MOIST"" is incorrect, feedback will help narrow options further (e.g., confirming M/O/T inclusion or exclusion).\n\n<guess>MOIST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are on the third guess.

So we must avoid these.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is of the form: [letter1] [letter2] I S [letter5]\nwhere letter1, letter2, letter5 are from the remaining alphabet, excluding R, A, E, M, O, T.\n\nThe remaining letters are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a valid English word that fits this pattern and uses only these letters.\n\nWe also want to maximize information. Since we have three positions to guess, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s list possible words that fit the pattern and use only the allowed letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- We need words of the form: ? ? I S ?\n\nSome candidates:\n- BLISS: B L I S S -> but S is repeated? And we have S at position 4, so if the word has S at position 5, that\'s allowed? But we don\'t know if S is duplicated. However, in our feedback, for MOIST, we had S at position 4 correct, but we don\'t have information about other S\'s. But note: in the first guess, we had S only at position 4 and it was correct, but that doesn\'t rule out another S. Similarly, in MOIST, we had S at position 4 and no other S, so if the secret word has two S\'s, we wouldn\'t know.\n\nBut in BLISS, the pattern is: B L I S S -> so positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:I, 4:S, 5:S. This fits the pattern.\n\nBut we must check if B and L are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.\n\nSimilarly, other words:\n- CHIPS: C H I P S -> but position 4 is P? No, we need position 4 to be S. So not.\n\n- We need position 4 to be S, so the word must end with S? No, position 4 is the fourth letter, and the fifth is separate. So the word is ? ? I S ?.\n\nAnother candidate: ""THIS"" is 4 letters, too short.\n\n""KIWIS"": K I W I S -> but position 3 is W? No, we need position 3 to be I. So: \n  Position1: K, position2: I? But then position3 would be W? That\'s not I. So no.\n\nWe need position3 to be I, so the third letter must be I.\n\nAnother: ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> but A is absent (from first guess), so not allowed.\n\n""WAIFS"": W A I F S -> A is absent.\n\n""FLIPS"": F L I P S -> position4 is P? No.\n\n""BLIPS"": B L I P S -> same, position4 is P.\n\n""SNIPS"": S N I P S -> position4 is P? No.\n\nBut note: we need position4 to be S? How about words that have S at position4? \n\nActually, the pattern is fixed: ... I S _ so the fourth letter is S, and the fifth is something.\n\nSo words ending with ""IS"" followed by a letter? No, the ""IS"" is positions 3 and 4, so the word ends with ""S"" at position4 and then a fifth letter.\n\nSo the structure is: [consonant] [consonant] I S [vowel or consonant]\n\nBut we don\'t have vowels left? We have U as a vowel? And Y sometimes.\n\nThe absent vowels: A, E, O. So we have I (which is already placed) and U, and sometimes Y.\n\nSo possible vowels for letter5: U, Y? And consonants.\n\nLet\'s think of words:\n\n- ""BUILS""? Not a word.\n\n- ""BUIST""? But T is absent.\n\n- ""GUISE"": G U I S E -> but E is absent.\n\n- ""JUISE""? Not a word.\n\n- ""LUIS"" is 4 letters.\n\n- ""QUIPS"": Q U I P S -> position4 is P? No.\n\n- ""QUITS"": Q U I T S -> position4 is T? No, we need S at position4.\n\n- ""WHISK"": W H I S K -> \n  Position1: W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:S, 5:K -> this fits the pattern.\n\nWHISK is a word! And it uses W, H, K, which are allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLISS"": B L I S S -> as above.\n\n""CHINS"" is C H I N S -> position4 is N? No.\n\n""SHINS"": S H I N S -> position4 is N? No.\n\n""SKINS"": S K I N S -> position4 is N? No.\n\n""SPINS"": S P I N S -> position4 is N? No.\n\n""THINS"": T H I N S -> but T is absent.\n\n""WINNS""? Not a word.\n\n""FLISS""? Not common.\n\n""GLYPH""? Not matching pattern.\n\nSo far, we have:\n- WHISK: W H I S K\n- BLISS: B L I S S\n\nAlso, ""SWISS"": S W I S S -> but position1: S, position2: W, position3: I, position4: S, position5: S. This fits? \n  But we have S at position1? We don\'t know if S is duplicated? And S is already known to be at position4. But we haven\'t tested S at other positions? \n\nHowever, in the first guess, we had S at position4 and it was correct, but we didn\'t have S at other positions? So it\'s possible.\n\nBut note: in the feedback for RAISE, we had S at position4 correct, but that doesn\'t tell us about other S\'s. Similarly, in MOIST, we had S at position4 and no other S, so if the secret word has S at position1, we would get a different feedback? \n\nBut in our current pattern, we are only requiring position4 to be S. So SWISS is a candidate? \n\nBut let\'s check the letters: S, W, I, S, S. We know I and S are in the word. W is new? And S at position1 and 5? \n\nBut we must avoid the absent letters: R,A,E,M,O,T. S is not absent? So it\'s allowed.\n\nBut we have two candidates: WHISK and BLISS and SWISS.\n\nAnother: ""BRISK"": B R I S K -> but R is absent? From first guess, R is absent. So not allowed.\n\n""CRISP"": C R I S P -> R absent.\n\n""DRIPS"": D R I P S -> R absent.\n\n""GRIPS"": G R I P S -> R absent.\n\n""PRISM"": P R I S M -> R absent.\n\nSo no.\n\n""FLITS"": F L I T S -> T absent.\n\n""SLITS"": S L I T S -> T absent.\n\n""SPITS"": S P I T S -> T absent.\n\nSo WHISK, BLISS, SWISS are candidates.\n\nAlso, ""CHISS""? Not a word.\n\n""PHISH"": P H I S H -> \n  Position1: P, 2:H, 3:I, 4:S, 5:H -> fits? And H is repeated? But allowed? \n  PHISH is a word? It might be accepted? But let\'s see: it\'s a proper name? But in word games, sometimes accepted? \n\nBut let\'s stick to common words.\n\nAnother: ""WHISP"": W H I S P -> position5: P? \n  WHISP is a word? It might be rare. \n\nBut WHISK is better.\n\nAlso, ""BLISH""? Not a word.\n\nSo let\'s list the candidates we have:\n1. WHISK: W, H, I, S, K -> tests W, H, K (all new)\n2. BLISS: B, L, I, S, S -> tests B, L, and has double S? So we test B and L, but S is repeated? \n3. SWISS: S, W, I, S, S -> tests W, and has triple S? \n\nWe want to maximize information. \n\nIf we guess WHISK:\n  - We test three new letters: W, H, K.\n  - If any of them are in the word, we get feedback.\n\nIf we guess BLISS:\n  - We test B and L (and we see if there is a second S? but we already know S is in the word, so if we get a ✓ for the last S, then we know there is a second S? But the feedback for the last S might be \'-\' if it\'s in the word but wrong position? Or if it\'s in the word and in the correct position? \n\nBut note: in BLISS, the last letter is S. If the secret word has S at position5, then we get ✓ for that S? But if the secret word does not have S at position5, but has S elsewhere? But we already have S at position4? So if there is only one S, then the last S in BLISS would be absent? But if there are two S\'s, then the last S might be correct or misplaced? \n\nBut the pattern requires position4 to be S, so if there is a second S, it must be at position1,2, or5? \n\nIn our case, for BLISS, if we guess and the secret word is, say, WHISK, then:\n  Position1: B vs W -> absent (x)\n  Position2: L vs H -> absent (x)\n  Position3: I ✓\n  Position4: S ✓\n  Position5: S vs K -> absent (x) because K is not S? \n\nBut if the secret word is BLISS, then:\n  Position1: B ✓\n  Position2: L ✓\n  Position3: I ✓\n  Position4: S ✓\n  Position5: S ✓\n\nSo we win.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess WHISK and the secret is BLISS, then:\n  Position1: W vs B -> absent (x)\n  Position2: H vs L -> absent (x)\n  Position3: I ✓\n  Position4: S ✓\n  Position5: K vs S -> absent (x)\n\nThen we get the same feedback? So we wouldn\'t know which one? \n\nBut we have other candidates? \n\nWe need to distinguish between the candidates.\n\nBut we have more than two? We also have SWISS? \n\nSWISS: S W I S S\n\nIf secret is BLISS: \n  Position1: S vs B -> absent? But S is in the word? But at position1? The secret BLISS has B at position1, so S would be absent? But wait: \n  The secret word BLISS has letters: B, L, I, S, S. \n  In SWISS: \n    Position1: S -> the secret has no S at position1? But it has S at position4 and 5? So the S at position1 in SWISS is not in the secret? But the secret has S, so it should be marked as present but wrong position? \n\nFeedback rules:\n  If the letter is in the word but not in that position, it\'s marked with \'-\'.\n\nSo for SWISS vs BLISS:\n  Position1: S -> the secret has S, but not at position1? So it should be \'-\'. \n  Position2: W -> the secret has no W? So absent (x)\n  Position3: I -> ✓\n  Position4: S -> ✓ (correct position)\n  Position5: S -> the secret has S at position5? So ✓? \n\nBut the secret BLISS has two S\'s: at position4 and 5. So when we guess SWISS:\n  Position1: S is present in the word? But not at position1? So we mark it with \'-\'? \n  Then position5: S is at the correct position? So ✓.\n\nBut the secret has two S\'s? So the first S in SWISS (position1) is not in the secret at position1, but the secret has S at position4 and 5? So the first S in SWISS is a misplaced S? \n\nBut the secret has two S\'s: one at position4 and one at position5. The guess SWISS has three S\'s? So we have to compare:\n\nSecret: B L I S S\nGuess:  S W I S S\n\nFor the first S in guess: \n  The secret has S at position4 and 5? But we haven\'t assigned any feedback yet? \n  We start from left: \n    Position1: S -> the secret has S at position4 and 5? So it is present, but not at position1? So we mark it with \'-\'. \n    Then we mark the S at position4: it matches the secret\'s position4? So ✓. \n    Then position5: it matches the secret\'s position5? So ✓. \n  But we have two S\'s in the secret? And we have used one for the first S (misplaced) and one for position4? But then the position5 S in the guess should also be compared? \n\nActually, the rule is: \n  First, mark the exact matches (correct position). \n  Then, for the remaining, mark the ones that are in the word but not in the correct position, but only as many as there are in the secret.\n\nIn this case:\n  Step 1: mark exact matches:\n    Position3: I ✓\n    Position4: S ✓\n    Position5: S ✓ (because secret has S at position5? But wait, the secret has S at position4 and 5? So position5 is also correct? \n  So we mark position3,4,5 as ✓.\n\n  Then, for position1: S -> the secret has two S\'s, but both are already matched at position4 and 5? So there is no extra S? So it should be absent? \n\nBut that doesn\'t seem right? \n\nActually, the standard Wordle rule: \n  The feedback is given per letter, but the total count of the letter in the feedback must match the count in the secret.\n\nIn secret BLISS: two S\'s.\nIn guess SWISS: three S\'s.\n\nWe first mark the exact matches: \n  Position3: I -> ✓\n  Position4: S -> ✓ (one S matched)\n  Position5: S -> ✓ (second S matched)\n\nThen, for position1: S -> there are no more S\'s in the secret? So it should be marked as absent (x). \nPosition2: W -> absent (x).\n\nSo feedback: S(-) would be wrong? It should be S(x) for position1? \n\nBut that seems inconsistent? \n\nActually, no: because the two S\'s in the secret are already matched at positions 4 and 5. So the S at position1 in the guess is extra and not present? So it should be marked absent.\n\nTherefore, for SWISS vs BLISS: \n  Position1: S (x) because no unmatched S left in secret? \n  Position2: W (x)\n  Position3: I (✓)\n  Position4: S (✓)\n  Position5: S (✓)\n\nBut that would be: S(x) W(x) I(✓) S(✓) S(✓)\n\nBut that is the same as if we guessed WHISK and the secret was BLISS? \n  WHISK: W(x) H(x) I(✓) S(✓) K(x) -> but K(x) and then S(✓) at position4? \n  Actually, for WHISK: \n      Position1: W (x) \n      Position2: H (x)\n      Position3: I (✓)\n      Position4: S (✓)\n      Position5: K (x)\n\nSo both guesses (WHISK and SWISS) would give two x\'s at the beginning, then two ✓ and then one x? But for SWISS, the last is ✓? \n\nNo, for SWISS vs BLISS: \n  We have: position1: x, position2: x, position3: ✓, position4: ✓, position5: ✓ -> so three ✓ at the end.\n\nFor WHISK vs BLISS: \n  position1: x, position2: x, position3: ✓, position4: ✓, position5: x -> so only two ✓.\n\nSo they are different.\n\nBut in our case, we are guessing to find the word. \n\nWe have three candidates: WHISK, BLISS, SWISS.\n\nWe need a guess that can help us distinguish.\n\nBut we have to make one guess. \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.\n\nBut we have only 6 guesses, and we are at guess 3.\n\nWe can choose a word that uses letters that are common in the candidates? \n\nBut the candidates have different letters.\n\nWe can list the possible letters for each position.\n\nPosition1: must be a letter not in {R,A,E,M,O,T} and not I,S (since I and S are fixed at 3 and 4). So from: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,N,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nSimilarly for position2 and position5.\n\nBut we know the word must contain I and S (already placed), and possibly other letters.\n\nNow, from the candidates:\n- WHISK: W at1, H at2, K at5\n- BLISS: B at1, L at2, S at5\n- SWISS: S at1, W at2, S at5\n\nBut note: in SWISS, position5 is S, so if we guess a word that has a different letter at5, we can test.\n\nBut we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nWe could guess a word that has new letters to cover more ground.\n\nFor example, we haven\'t tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has, say, B, L, and W? But we need to fit the pattern.\n\nWhat word? ""BLIWS""? Not a word.\n\n""BLOWS"": B L O W S -> but O is absent? And position4 is W? No.\n\nWe need position4 to be S? So not.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word that has a double letter? But we don\'t know.\n\nPerhaps we can choose ""WHISK"" as the guess because it uses three new letters and no duplicates.\n\nIf we guess WHISK and the feedback is:\n  If the secret is WHISK: we win.\n  If the secret is BLISS: then we get W(x) H(x) I(✓) S(✓) K(x) -> so we know the word is not WHISK, and then we can guess BLISS or SWISS next? \n  But then we have two candidates left? \n\nBut if we get that feedback, we know the secret has no W, H, K? So then the secret must be BLISS or SWISS? \n\nBut for BLISS: it has B, L, and S (with two S\'s). \nFor SWISS: it has S, W, and S (but W is now absent? because we got W(x) in WHISK? So if we got W(x) from WHISK, then SWISS is invalid because it has W? \n\nSo if we guess WHISK and get W(x) and H(x) and K(x), then the secret cannot have W, H, K? \n\nThen the only candidate left is BLISS? Because SWISS has W, which would be absent? \n\nSimilarly, if we get W present? Then it might be SWISS? \n\nBut let\'s see:\n\nCase 1: Secret is WHISK\n  Guess WHISK: all ✓ -> win.\n\nCase 2: Secret is BLISS\n  Guess WHISK: \n      W: absent (x) because BLISS has no W\n      H: absent (x) \n      I: ✓\n      S: ✓\n      K: absent (x) \n  So feedback: x x ✓ ✓ x\n\n  Then we know the secret has no W, H, K? And the pattern is _ _ I S _ \n  Then the only candidate is BLISS? Because SWISS has W, which is absent? So we can guess BLISS next.\n\nCase 3: Secret is SWISS\n  Guess WHISK:\n      Position1: W vs S -> W is not in SWISS? Wait, SWISS has W at position2? \n      So:\n        Position1: W -> the secret SWISS has W? But not at position1? So it should be marked as present but wrong position? \n        But we have to check: \n          Secret: S W I S S\n          Guess:  W H I S K\n        Step 1: mark exact matches:\n            Position3: I ✓\n            Position4: S ✓\n        Step 2: for the W at position1: the secret has W at position2? So it is present? Mark as \'-\'.\n        Position2: H -> the secret has no H? So absent (x)\n        Position5: K -> absent (x)\n        So feedback: W(-) H(x) I(✓) S(✓) K(x)\n\n  Then we know: \n      W is in the word but not at position1? \n      H and K are absent.\n      I and S are correct at positions 3 and 4.\n\n  Then the secret must have W? And the pattern is _ _ I S _ \n  And we know W is in the word? But not at position1? So it must be at position2 or 5? \n\n  But position5: we don\'t know? \n\n  Then we can try to guess a word that has W at position2? \n\n  For example, SWISS: S W I S S -> which fits? \n\n  But we have to avoid H and K? \n\n  So we can guess SWISS next.\n\nSo by guessing WHISK, we can distinguish:\n\n- If we get all ✓, done.\n- If we get x x ✓ ✓ x, then secret is BLISS.\n- If we get - x ✓ ✓ x, then secret is SWISS (or another word with W? but we don\'t have other candidates? \n\nBut what if there is another word? For example, ""ENNIS""? But E is absent.\n\nOr ""INNIS""? Not a word.\n\n""ILIAD""? Not matching pattern.\n\nSo probably the only candidates are WHISK, BLISS, SWISS.\n\nTherefore, guessing WHISK is a good move because it covers three new letters and helps us distinguish the candidates.\n\nWe can also consider that if we guess BLISS and it\'s not correct, we get information? \n\nBut if we guess BLISS and the secret is WHISK, we get:\n  B(x) L(x) I(✓) S(✓) S(x) -> because the secret WHISK has no B, L, and only one S? \n  Then we know the secret has no B, L? And the last S is absent? So then we can guess WHISK next? \n\nBut we are using two guesses? \n\nSimilarly, if we guess SWISS and the secret is BLISS, we get:\n  S (if at position1: but secret has B, so S is not at position1? But secret has S at position4 and 5? So S at position1 in guess is present? But not at position1? So \'-\'. \n  W: absent? \n  I: ✓\n  S: ✓ (position4)\n  S: at position5: the secret has S at position5? So ✓? \n  But wait: secret BLISS: B L I S S\n  guess SWISS: S W I S S\n  Feedback: \n      Position1: S -> present but not at1? Because secret has S at4 and5? So \'-\'\n      Position2: W -> absent (x)\n      Position3: I ✓\n      Position4: S ✓\n      Position5: S ✓\n  So we get: S(-) W(x) I(✓) S(✓) S(✓)\n\n  Then we know: \n      S is in the word but not at position1? \n      W is absent.\n      I and S at positions 3 and 4 are correct, and S at position5 is correct? \n      But then the secret must have S at position5? \n      And the pattern is _ _ I S S? \n      And we know the first letter is not S? Because we have S at position1 in the guess and it\'s not at1? But it could be at position2? \n      But the pattern is [not S] [letter2] I S S? \n      And we know letter2 is not W? \n\n  Then we can guess BLISS? \n\nBut it\'s a bit messy.\n\nSo to save guesses, WHISK is a better guess because it tests three new letters and we can then guess the word in the next turn.\n\nTherefore, I choose to guess WHISK.\n\n<guess>WHISK</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: RAISE** → R(absent), A(absent), I(correct position), S(correct position), E(absent)  \n  - This confirms:  \n    - **I** is in position 3.  \n    - **S** is in position 4.  \n    - R, A, E are **absent** from the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: MOIST** → M(absent), O(absent), I(correct position), S(correct position), T(absent)  \n  - This confirms:  \n    - **I** (position 3) and **S** (position 4) remain fixed.  \n    - M, O, T are **absent**.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word pattern is: **`_ _ I S _`** (positions 3 and 4 are fixed as **I** and **S**).  \n- **Absent letters**: R, A, E, M, O, T (cannot appear anywhere).  \n- **Remaining possible letters**: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Prioritize testing high-frequency unused letters (e.g., H, W, L, K) to maximize information.  \n- Choose a valid word that fits the pattern `_ _ I S _` and uses only allowed letters.  \n- **Top candidate words**:  \n  - **WHISK** (tests W, H, K — all new letters).  \n  - **BLISS** (tests B, L, and potential double-S).  \n  - **SWISS** (tests S at new positions and W).  \n- **Why WHISK?**  \n  - Tests 3 new common letters (W, H, K).  \n  - Helps distinguish between top candidates:  \n    - If **WHISK** is correct, we win.  \n    - If feedback shows W/H/K absent, **BLISS** becomes likely.  \n    - If feedback shows W present (but misplaced), **SWISS** becomes likely.\n\n<guess>WHISK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: WHISK -> FEEDBACK: W(-) H(-) I(✓) S(✓) K(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are on the fourth guess. The feedback so far:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)
  Meaning: I is correct at position 3, S is correct at position 4. R, A, E are absent.

Guess 2: MOIST -> M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(✓) T(x)
  Meaning: I and S are still correct at positions 3 and 4. M, O, T are absent.

Guess 3: WHISK -> W(-) H(-) I(✓) S(✓) K(x)
  Meaning: I and S are correct at positions 3 and 4. K is absent. W and H are present in the word but in the wrong positions.

So, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ I S _
- The letters I and S are fixed at positions 3 and 4.
- The absent letters are: R, A, E, M, O, T, K.
- The present letters (but not in the correct position) are: W and H.

Therefore, the secret word contains W and H, but not at the positions we guessed in WHISK (i.e., not at position 1 for W and not at position 2 for H).

Since the pattern is _ _ I S _, the W and H must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.

But note: in WHISK, we had W at position 1 and H at position 2. The feedback says they are present but in the wrong positions, so they cannot be at position 1 or 2? 

Wait, no: the feedback says they are in the word but not in the position we guessed. So:
- W is in the word, but not at position 1.
- H is in the word, but not at position 2.

Therefore, W must be at position 2 or 5? And H must be at position 1 or 5? 

But the positions available are 1, 2, and 5.

So:
- W can be at position 2 or 5 (since not at 1).
- H can be at position 1 or 5 (since not at 2).

Also, note that position 5 is shared, so it could be that one of them is at 5 and the other at 1 or 2.

Moreover, the word must have exactly these letters: I, S, W, H, and one more letter? But we have five positions: 
  Position1: either H or another letter? 
  Position2: either W or another letter?
  Position3: I
  Position4: S
  Position5: must be the remaining letter, which could be W, H, or a new letter? 

But we know the word has W and H, so the fifth letter could be a new letter? Or one of W or H is at position 5.

But we have only three positions (1,2,5) for two letters (W and H) and one more letter? 

Actually, the word has five letters. We know four of them: I, S, W, H. So the fifth letter is unknown, but must be from the remaining letters (excluding absent ones).

The absent letters are: R, A, E, M, O, T, K.

So the remaining letters are: B, C, D, F, G, J, L, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But we also have W and H which are present.

So the secret word consists of: 
  - I (at pos3), S (at pos4), W, H, and one more letter (let's call it X) from the remaining.

The positions 1,2,5 must be filled by W, H, and X.

But W cannot be at pos1, H cannot be at pos2.

Possible assignments:

Option 1: 
  Position1: H (since H can be at 1)
  Position2: X (the new letter)
  Position5: W (since W cannot be at 1, but can be at 5)

Option 2:
  Position1: X
  Position2: W (since W can be at 2)
  Position5: H (H can be at 5)

Option 3:
  Position1: H
  Position2: W  -> but wait, can W be at 2? Yes, because the feedback only said W is not at 1. Similarly, H at 1 is allowed. But then position5 must be X.

But in this case, we have H at 1 and W at 2. Is that allowed? 
  Feedback for WHISK: W was at 1 (wrong) and H at 2 (wrong). But if the secret has H at 1 and W at 2, then in the guess WHISK we had W at 1 and H at 2, which are swapped? Then the feedback would mark them as present but wrong position? That is consistent.

So all three options are possible.

We need to form a valid English word.

We also know that the word must have the pattern: 
  Option 1: H _ I S W  -> H at1, ? at2, I, S, W at5 -> so the word is H?ISW -> but that doesn't form a word? 

  Option 2: X W I S H -> so the word is ? W I S H

  Option 3: H W I S X -> so the word is H W I S ?

Let's think of words:

First, Option 2: ? W I S H
  Examples: 
    SWISH: S W I S H -> but S is at position1? But we already have S at position4? And the word has two S's? 
    But note: the secret word might have two S's? We know S is at position4, but it could have another S? 
    However, in SWISH: 
        Position1: S -> but we have S at position4? So if the secret is SWISH, then we have S at1 and S at4? 
        But we also have H at5? 
    Now, check the feedback from previous guesses:
        Guess1: RAISE -> had S at position4: correct. But it didn't test S at position1? So it's possible.
        Guess3: WHISK -> had W at1 (which is not S) and H at2 (which is not I) -> but in SWISH, position1 is S and position2 is W? 
        So for WHISK vs SWISH:
            Position1: W (guess) vs S (secret) -> W is not in the word? But wait, SWISH has W at position2? So W is present? 
            So feedback: W should be marked as present but wrong position? Similarly, H: in guess at position2, but in secret at position5? So H is present but wrong position? 
        And we got W(-) H(-) I(✓) S(✓) K(x) -> which matches.

    So SWISH is a candidate.

    Other words: 
      DWISH? Not a word.
      CWISH? No.
      So SWISH is a candidate.

Option 3: H W I S ? 
  Examples: 
    HWIS? -> need a fifth letter. 
    HWIST? But T is absent.
    HWISK? But K is absent and we have K(x) from guess3.
    HWISL? Not a word.
    HWISM? M absent.
    So no common words.

Option 1: H ? I S W
  Examples: 
    H A I S W -> but A is absent.
    H E I S W -> E absent.
    H I I S W -> duplicate I? Not allowed? And I is at position3, so position2 cannot be I? 
    H O I S W -> O absent.
    H T I S W -> T absent.
    So no.

But what about other options? We have the possibility that the fifth letter is W or H? 

For example, if the word has only one of W or H? But the feedback says both are present? So we must have both.

Another possibility: the fifth letter is W and H is at position1? Then the word is H ? I S W -> which we considered.

Or the fifth letter is H and W is at position2? Then the word is ? W I S H -> which we have SWISH.

Or the fifth letter is a new letter, and then we have:
  Either:
    H at1, W at2, X at5 -> H W I S X -> we couldn't find a word.
    or H at1, X at2, W at5 -> H X I S W -> no word.
    or X at1, W at2, H at5 -> X W I S H -> which is the pattern for SWISH (if X is S).

But we also have the possibility that the word has more than one of a letter? 

Another candidate: what if the word is ""WHICH""? 
  W H I C H -> but then position4 is C? We need position4 to be S. So no.

Or ""THUMB"" -> doesn't fit.

So the only candidate we have so far is SWISH.

But let's confirm: 
  SWISH: S W I S H
  Positions: 
    1: S
    2: W
    3: I
    4: S
    5: H

  Check against feedback:
    Guess1: RAISE -> R(x), A(x), I(✓) [position3], S(✓) [position4], E(x) -> correct.
    Guess2: MOIST -> M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(✓) [position4], T(x) -> correct. Note: the S at position1 in SWISH was not tested in MOIST? But MOIST had no S at position1? So it's okay.
    Guess3: WHISK -> 
        W at position1: in secret, W is at position2 -> so present but wrong position -> (-)
        H at position2: in secret, H is at position5 -> present but wrong position -> (-)
        I at position3: ✓
        S at position4: ✓
        K at position5: absent (x) -> because secret has H at5? 
        So feedback: W(-) H(-) I(✓) S(✓) K(x) -> matches.

  So SWISH fits.

But are there other words? 

What about ""SWISS""? 
  SWISS: S W I S S
  But then position5 is S? 
  Then for guess3: WHISK vs SWISS:
      Position1: W vs S -> W is not S, but secret has W at position2? So W is present? -> (-)
      Position2: H vs W -> H is not in the word? Because secret has S,W,I,S,S -> no H? 
        So H should be absent? But we got H(-) in feedback, meaning H is present? Contradiction.
  So SWISS is invalid because it has no H.

Another candidate: ""SHOWY"" -> doesn't fit pattern.

Or ""SHIRE"" -> E absent and R absent.

What about ""SHUSH""? 
  S H U S H -> 
  Positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:U? But we need I at position3. So no.

Or ""SWITH""? Not a word.

So SWISH seems the only common word.

But let's think: is there a word like ""DWINE""? No.

Another: ""SWILL"" -> S W I L L -> but position4 is L? We need S at position4. So no.

Therefore, we should guess SWISH.

But note: in SWISH, we have two S's. We know S is at position4, and we are putting S at position1. This is allowed because the feedback from RAISE only confirmed S at position4, not that there is only one S.

So I think SWISH is the word.

But to be safe, we can consider if there are other words that fit the pattern and the feedback.

What about ""WHIPS""? 
  W H I P S -> 
  But then position4 is P? We need S at position4. So no.

""WHIMS""? -> M absent and position4 is M? No.

So I think SWISH is the answer.

Therefore, we guess SWISH.

But note: we are to make a guess, and if it's not correct, we get feedback.

So let's go with SWISH.

<guess>SWISH</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: RAISE** → R(absent), A(absent), I(correct position), S(correct position), E(absent)  
  - **I** is fixed at position 3, **S** is fixed at position 4.  
  - R, A, E are **absent**.  
- **Guess 2: MOIST** → M(absent), O(absent), I(correct position), S(correct position), T(absent)  
  - Confirms **I** (pos 3) and **S** (pos 4).  
  - M, O, T are **absent**.  
- **Guess 3: WHISK** → W(misplaced), H(misplaced), I(correct position), S(correct position), K(absent)  
  - **I** (pos 3) and **S** (pos 4) remain fixed.  
  - W and H are **present but misplaced** (cannot be at positions 1 or 2, respectively).  
  - K is **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ I S _` (positions 3 and 4 are fixed as **I** and **S**).  
- **Confirmed absent letters**: R, A, E, M, O, T, K.  
- **Present letters**: W and H must appear in positions 1, 2, or 5 (but W ≠ pos 1, H ≠ pos 2).  
- **Remaining possible letters**: B, C, D, F, G, J, L, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.  

### Deductions:
- W and H must occupy two of the three open positions (1, 2, 5).  
- The third open position must be a new letter (not W, H, I, S, or absent letters).  
- Possible configurations:  
  1. **Position 1 = H**, Position 2 = [new letter], Position 5 = W  
  2. **Position 1 = [new letter]**, Position 2 = W, Position 5 = H  
  3. **Position 1 = H**, Position 2 = W, Position 5 = [new letter]  
- After testing common words, **SWISH** (S W I S H) fits all constraints:  
  - Pattern: `S W I S H` → Positions 3 and 4 are I and S (correct).  
  - W is misplaced (pos 2, not 1) and H is misplaced (pos 5, not 2), matching feedback.  
  - Uses only allowed letters (S, W, H, I) with no absent letters.  
  - Valid English word (meaning: a rustling/swooshing sound).  

### Why SWISH?
- Tests all unresolved letters (W, H) and checks for double-S (S at pos 1 and 4).  
- If correct, solves the puzzle. If not, feedback will confirm/reject S at position 1 and H at position 5.  

<guess>SWISH</guess>",SWISH,"We are on the fourth guess. The feedback so far:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x)
  Meaning: I is correct at position 3, S is correct at position 4. R, A, E are absent.

Guess 2: MOIST -> M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(✓) T(x)
  Meaning: I and S are still correct at positions 3 and 4. M, O, T are absent.

Guess 3: WHISK -> W(-) H(-) I(✓) S(✓) K(x)
  Meaning: I and S are correct at positions 3 and 4. K is absent. W and H are present in the word but in the wrong positions.

So, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ I S _
- The letters I and S are fixed at positions 3 and 4.
- The absent letters are: R, A, E, M, O, T, K.
- The present letters (but not in the correct position) are: W and H.

Therefore, the secret word contains W and H, but not at the positions we guessed in WHISK (i.e., not at position 1 for W and not at position 2 for H).

Since the pattern is _ _ I S _, the W and H must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.

But note: in WHISK, we had W at position 1 and H at position 2. The feedback says they are present but in the wrong positions, so they cannot be at position 1 or 2? 

Wait, no: the feedback says they are in the word but not in the position we guessed. So:
- W is in the word, but not at position 1.
- H is in the word, but not at position 2.

Therefore, W must be at position 2 or 5? And H must be at position 1 or 5? 

But the positions available are 1, 2, and 5.

So:
- W can be at position 2 or 5 (since not at 1).
- H can be at position 1 or 5 (since not at 2).

Also, note that position 5 is shared, so it could be that one of them is at 5 and the other at 1 or 2.

Moreover, the word must have exactly these letters: I, S, W, H, and one more letter? But we have five positions: 
  Position1: either H or another letter? 
  Position2: either W or another letter?
  Position3: I
  Position4: S
  Position5: must be the remaining letter, which could be W, H, or a new letter? 

But we know the word has W and H, so the fifth letter could be a new letter? Or one of W or H is at position 5.

But we have only three positions (1,2,5) for two letters (W and H) and one more letter? 

Actually, the word has five letters. We know four of them: I, S, W, H. So the fifth letter is unknown, but must be from the remaining letters (excluding absent ones).

The absent letters are: R, A, E, M, O, T, K.

So the remaining letters are: B, C, D, F, G, J, L, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But we also have W and H which are present.

So the secret word consists of: 
  - I (at pos3), S (at pos4), W, H, and one more letter (let's call it X) from the remaining.

The positions 1,2,5 must be filled by W, H, and X.

But W cannot be at pos1, H cannot be at pos2.

Possible assignments:

Option 1: 
  Position1: H (since H can be at 1)
  Position2: X (the new letter)
  Position5: W (since W cannot be at 1, but can be at 5)

Option 2:
  Position1: X
  Position2: W (since W can be at 2)
  Position5: H (H can be at 5)

Option 3:
  Position1: H
  Position2: W  -> but wait, can W be at 2? Yes, because the feedback only said W is not at 1. Similarly, H at 1 is allowed. But then position5 must be X.

But in this case, we have H at 1 and W at 2. Is that allowed? 
  Feedback for WHISK: W was at 1 (wrong) and H at 2 (wrong). But if the secret has H at 1 and W at 2, then in the guess WHISK we had W at 1 and H at 2, which are swapped? Then the feedback would mark them as present but wrong position? That is consistent.

So all three options are possible.

We need to form a valid English word.

We also know that the word must have the pattern: 
  Option 1: H _ I S W  -> H at1, ? at2, I, S, W at5 -> so the word is H?ISW -> but that doesn't form a word? 

  Option 2: X W I S H -> so the word is ? W I S H

  Option 3: H W I S X -> so the word is H W I S ?

Let's think of words:

First, Option 2: ? W I S H
  Examples: 
    SWISH: S W I S H -> but S is at position1? But we already have S at position4? And the word has two S's? 
    But note: the secret word might have two S's? We know S is at position4, but it could have another S? 
    However, in SWISH: 
        Position1: S -> but we have S at position4? So if the secret is SWISH, then we have S at1 and S at4? 
        But we also have H at5? 
    Now, check the feedback from previous guesses:
        Guess1: RAISE -> had S at position4: correct. But it didn't test S at position1? So it's possible.
        Guess3: WHISK -> had W at1 (which is not S) and H at2 (which is not I) -> but in SWISH, position1 is S and position2 is W? 
        So for WHISK vs SWISH:
            Position1: W (guess) vs S (secret) -> W is not in the word? But wait, SWISH has W at position2? So W is present? 
            So feedback: W should be marked as present but wrong position? Similarly, H: in guess at position2, but in secret at position5? So H is present but wrong position? 
        And we got W(-) H(-) I(✓) S(✓) K(x) -> which matches.

    So SWISH is a candidate.

    Other words: 
      DWISH? Not a word.
      CWISH? No.
      So SWISH is a candidate.

Option 3: H W I S ? 
  Examples: 
    HWIS? -> need a fifth letter. 
    HWIST? But T is absent.
    HWISK? But K is absent and we have K(x) from guess3.
    HWISL? Not a word.
    HWISM? M absent.
    So no common words.

Option 1: H ? I S W
  Examples: 
    H A I S W -> but A is absent.
    H E I S W -> E absent.
    H I I S W -> duplicate I? Not allowed? And I is at position3, so position2 cannot be I? 
    H O I S W -> O absent.
    H T I S W -> T absent.
    So no.

But what about other options? We have the possibility that the fifth letter is W or H? 

For example, if the word has only one of W or H? But the feedback says both are present? So we must have both.

Another possibility: the fifth letter is W and H is at position1? Then the word is H ? I S W -> which we considered.

Or the fifth letter is H and W is at position2? Then the word is ? W I S H -> which we have SWISH.

Or the fifth letter is a new letter, and then we have:
  Either:
    H at1, W at2, X at5 -> H W I S X -> we couldn't find a word.
    or H at1, X at2, W at5 -> H X I S W -> no word.
    or X at1, W at2, H at5 -> X W I S H -> which is the pattern for SWISH (if X is S).

But we also have the possibility that the word has more than one of a letter? 

Another candidate: what if the word is ""WHICH""? 
  W H I C H -> but then position4 is C? We need position4 to be S. So no.

Or ""THUMB"" -> doesn't fit.

So the only candidate we have so far is SWISH.

But let's confirm: 
  SWISH: S W I S H
  Positions: 
    1: S
    2: W
    3: I
    4: S
    5: H

  Check against feedback:
    Guess1: RAISE -> R(x), A(x), I(✓) [position3], S(✓) [position4], E(x) -> correct.
    Guess2: MOIST -> M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(✓) [position4], T(x) -> correct. Note: the S at position1 in SWISH was not tested in MOIST? But MOIST had no S at position1? So it's okay.
    Guess3: WHISK -> 
        W at position1: in secret, W is at position2 -> so present but wrong position -> (-)
        H at position2: in secret, H is at position5 -> present but wrong position -> (-)
        I at position3: ✓
        S at position4: ✓
        K at position5: absent (x) -> because secret has H at5? 
        So feedback: W(-) H(-) I(✓) S(✓) K(x) -> matches.

  So SWISH fits.

But are there other words? 

What about ""SWISS""? 
  SWISS: S W I S S
  But then position5 is S? 
  Then for guess3: WHISK vs SWISS:
      Position1: W vs S -> W is not S, but secret has W at position2? So W is present? -> (-)
      Position2: H vs W -> H is not in the word? Because secret has S,W,I,S,S -> no H? 
        So H should be absent? But we got H(-) in feedback, meaning H is present? Contradiction.
  So SWISS is invalid because it has no H.

Another candidate: ""SHOWY"" -> doesn't fit pattern.

Or ""SHIRE"" -> E absent and R absent.

What about ""SHUSH""? 
  S H U S H -> 
  Positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:U? But we need I at position3. So no.

Or ""SWITH""? Not a word.

So SWISH seems the only common word.

But let's think: is there a word like ""DWINE""? No.

Another: ""SWILL"" -> S W I L L -> but position4 is L? We need S at position4. So no.

Therefore, we should guess SWISH.

But note: in SWISH, we have two S's. We know S is at position4, and we are putting S at position1. This is allowed because the feedback from RAISE only confirmed S at position4, not that there is only one S.

So I think SWISH is the word.

But to be safe, we can consider if there are other words that fit the pattern and the feedback.

What about ""WHIPS""? 
  W H I P S -> 
  But then position4 is P? We need S at position4. So no.

""WHIMS""? -> M absent and position4 is M? No.

So I think SWISH is the answer.

Therefore, we guess SWISH.

But note: we are to make a guess, and if it's not correct, we get feedback.

So let's go with SWISH.
