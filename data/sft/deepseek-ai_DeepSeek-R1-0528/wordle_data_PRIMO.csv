We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

This means:
- R is correct and in the correct position (position 2, since ""crane"" is c-r-a-n-e).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So, the secret word has R as the second letter, and does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Since the word has R in the second position, and we know which letters are absent, we can try to form a new guess.

We need a 5-letter word that has R in the second position, and avoids C, A, N, E.

Common letters that might appear: let's think of vowels and consonants that are not excluded. Vowels: since A and E are out, we have I, O, U. Also Y can sometimes be a vowel.

We can try to use other common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

A good approach might be to use a word that includes letters we haven't tested yet, so we can get more information.

Possible words with R in the second position?

Let me think of some words: 
- b_r__ : like ""brick"", ""bring"", but we must avoid A, E, N? Actually, we know N and E are absent, so avoid them.
But also, we haven't tested B? So that might be okay.

Alternatively, we can try words like ""proud"", but R is second and we have O and U.

But let's list possible words.

We shouldn't reuse the absent letters.

So, absent letters: C, A, N, E.

Also, we know that the first, third, fourth, and fifth letters are not C, A, N, E, and they don't contain R? Well R is in the second position, so other positions could have other letters.

We need to maximize new letter information.

Let me try to think of a word with R in the second position and as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

Let me try ""proud"": 
- p, r (correct), o, u, d
But we don't know about these letters.

Another idea: ""storm"" - S, T, O, R, M. But R is in the second position? ""storm"" is s-t-o-r-m? Wait, no: s-t-o-r-m would have R in the fourth position? 

We need R to be in the second position. So examples:
- brick: b-r-i-c-k -> but c is already known absent? So we cannot use C.

Similarly, let think:
- ""bring"": b-r-i-n-g -> but n is absent, so invalid because we know n is not in the word? The guess must be a valid word, but ""bring"" contains N and we know N is absent? But the feedback says N is absent? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had N(x) meaning N is not in the word. So if we use a word containing N, then we know one letter would be x and we already know N is absent? It's inefficient because we already know N is absent.

So better to avoid letters that we know are absent.

So avoid C, A, N, E.

Possible words with structure: _ R _ _ _

We can try ""dirty"": d-i-r-t-y? No, R should be second. So d-r? ""dirty"" is d-i-r-t-y -> R is third? That's not second.

What are some words with R in the second position?

Examples:
- bread: but contains E and A, which are absent -> not allowed? We know E and A are absent, so we cannot use them.

We must avoid letters that are known absent? No, we can use them, but they will be marked x and we gain no new information. So it's better to avoid them to learn about new letters.

So let's list words that have R as second letter and do not contain C, A, N, E.

Possible letters: b, d, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, o, p, q, r? R is already in the word, but we can use R only once? Not necessarily, but since R is confirmed correct and it is only second, it might appear elsewhere? But usually Wordle allows words with duplicate letters? I think so, but we don't know if the secret word has duplicates.

But in this case, for guessing, we can use duplicate letters, but avoid known absent ones.

But we know R is present and in position 2, so the other R? We don't know.

To keep it simple, let's assume we avoid known absent and use new letters.

Common words: 
- ""proxy"": p-r-o-x-y -> no A,E,N,C? It has O and X, but X is less common. But we haven't tested O, P, X, Y.

Another: ""proud"": p-r-o-u-d -> has O, U, D, P. Avoids absent letters.

""froze"": f-r-o-z-e -> but E is absent? E is last letter, but we know E is absent, so using it would be x, which we already know. So better not to use E.

Similarly, ""crowd"": c is absent and w is new? But C is absent, so we know it will be x.

So let's list without A,C,N,E.

Possible words: 
- ""proud"": p-r-o-u-d
- ""group"": but R is second? g-r-o-u-p -> that's R in second? G is first, R second, then O,U,P. But ""group"" is 5 letters? g-r-o-u-p, yes.

However, ""group"" has O and U.

Another: ""truck"": but C and U? U is okay, but C is absent -> not good.

""fruit"": f-r-u-i-t -> has U and I.

""brisk"": b-r-i-s-k -> has I and S.

""draft"": d-r-a-f-t -> but A is absent -> avoid.

So one good candidate is ""brisk"": b-r-i-s-k.

We haven't tested B, I, S, K.

Similarly, ""guild"": but R? No, ""guild"" has u,i,l,d? Not R second.

So let's consider ""brisk"".

Another option: ""prism"": p-r-i-s-m -> has P, I, S, M.

We can compare:

I want to include common vowels: since A and E are absent, we have O, I, U.

So ""brisk"" has I, which is a vowel.

Also, ""proud"" has O and U.

""fruit"" has U and I.

Let me choose one that covers more vowels.

Since we have R fixed at second, let's try to include I and O? But we can't cover all at once.

We can choose one that also has common consonants.

Common consonants: T, L, S, P, etc.

So ""prism"" might be good: p-r-i-s-m -> letters P, R (known), I, S, M.

Or ""trope"": t-r-o-p-e -> but E is absent? Last letter E will be x, and we know it. So we lose information on one letter.

Similarly, ""trump"": t-r-u-m-p -> U and M.

But ""trump"" has T, R, U, M, P.

So let's decide.

I think ""brisk"" is good because it has B, I, S, K, and avoids known absent letters.

Similarly, ""prick"" has C which is absent -> no.

""bring"" has N absent -> avoid.

So I'll go with ""brisk"".

So my guess is ""brisk"".

Let's think: ""proxy"" is also good: p-r-o-x-y -> we can test O and Y, and X is less common but still.

But ""brisk"" has more common letters.

Perhaps ""straw"": s-t-r-a-w -> but A is absent -> avoid.

Therefore, ""brisk"" seems a good guess.

So I'll guess ""brisk"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is correct and in the correct position (second letter).
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.

For the next guess:
- The word must have R in the second position.
- It should avoid using C, A, N, or E to maximize new information.
- Focus on testing common unverified letters like B, I, S, K, O, U, etc.

I chose ""brisk"" because:
- It has R in the second position.
- It introduces new common letters: B (first position), I (third), S (fourth), K (fifth).
- These letters haven't been tested yet and are relatively frequent in English words.
- It avoids absent letters C, A, N, E.

This guess will provide feedback on whether B, I, S, or K are in the secret word and their positions, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

- bread: but contains E and A, which are absent -> not allowed? We know E and A are absent, so we cannot use them.

We must avoid letters that are known absent? No, we can use them, but they will be marked x and we gain no new information. So it's better to avoid them to learn about new letters.

So let's list words that have R as second letter and do not contain C, A, N, E.

Possible letters: b, d, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, o, p, q, r? R is already in the word, but we can use R only once? Not necessarily, but since R is confirmed correct and it is only second, it might appear elsewhere? But usually Wordle allows words with duplicate letters? I think so, but we don't know if the secret word has duplicates.

But in this case, for guessing, we can use duplicate letters, but avoid known absent ones.

But we know R is present and in position 2, so the other R? We don't know.

To keep it simple, let's assume we avoid known absent and use new letters.

Common words: 
- ""proxy"": p-r-o-x-y -> no A,E,N,C? It has O and X, but X is less common. But we haven't tested O, P, X, Y.

Another: ""proud"": p-r-o-u-d -> has O, U, D, P. Avoids absent letters.

""froze"": f-r-o-z-e -> but E is absent? E is last letter, but we know E is absent, so using it would be x, which we already know. So better not to use E.

Similarly, ""crowd"": c is absent and w is new? But C is absent, so we know it will be x.

So let's list without A,C,N,E.

Possible words: 
- ""proud"": p-r-o-u-d
- ""group"": but R is second? g-r-o-u-p -> that's R in second? G is first, R second, then O,U,P. But ""group"" is 5 letters? g-r-o-u-p, yes.

However, ""group"" has O and U.

Another: ""truck"": but C and U? U is okay, but C is absent -> not good.

""fruit"": f-r-u-i-t -> has U and I.

""brisk"": b-r-i-s-k -> has I and S.

""draft"": d-r-a-f-t -> but A is absent -> avoid.

So one good candidate is ""brisk"": b-r-i-s-k.

We haven't tested B, I, S, K.

Similarly, ""guild"": but R? No, ""guild"" has u,i,l,d? Not R second.

So let's consider ""brisk"".

Another option: ""prism"": p-r-i-s-m -> has P, I, S, M.

We can compare:

I want to include common vowels: since A and E are absent, we have O, I, U.

So ""brisk"" has I, which is a vowel.

Also, ""proud"" has O and U.

""fruit"" has U and I.

Let me choose one that covers more vowels.

Since we have R fixed at second, let's try to include I and O? But we can't cover all at once.

We can choose one that also has common consonants.

Common consonants: T, L, S, P, etc.

So ""prism"" might be good: p-r-i-s-m -> letters P, R (known), I, S, M.

Or ""trope"": t-r-o-p-e -> but E is absent? Last letter E will be x, and we know it. So we lose information on one letter.

Similarly, ""trump"": t-r-u-m-p -> U and M.

But ""trump"" has T, R, U, M, P.

So let's decide.

I think ""brisk"" is good because it has B, I, S, K, and avoids known absent letters.

Similarly, ""prick"" has C which is absent -> no.

""bring"" has N absent -> avoid.

So I'll go with ""brisk"".

So my guess is ""brisk"".

Let's think: ""proxy"" is also good: p-r-o-x-y -> we can test O and Y, and X is less common but still.

But ""brisk"" has more common letters.

Perhaps ""straw"": s-t-r-a-w -> but A is absent -> avoid.

Therefore, ""brisk"" seems a good guess.

So I'll guess ""brisk"".

<guess>brisk</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is correct and in the correct position (second letter).
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.

For the next guess:
- The word must have R in the second position.
- It should avoid using C, A, N, or E to maximize new information.
- Focus on testing common unverified letters like B, I, S, K, O, U, etc.

I chose ""brisk"" because:
- It has R in the second position.
- It introduces new common letters: B (first position), I (third), S (fourth), K (fifth).
- These letters haven't been tested yet and are relatively frequent in English words.
- It avoids absent letters C, A, N, E.

This guess will provide feedback on whether B, I, S, or K are in the secret word and their positions, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
   - This means R is in the correct position (2nd letter), and C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

2. Guess ""brisk"": B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)
   - R is correct and in position 2 (as before).
   - I is correct and in position 3 (since in ""brisk"", I is the third letter).
   - B, S, K are not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The word is of the form: _ R I _ _
- Additionally, the letters that are absent: A, B, C, E, K, N, S. (Since they were marked x in positions where we didn't have duplicates.)

We must avoid these absent letters.

We also know that R is in the second position and I is in the third.

Now, we need to guess a 5-letter word with:
- Second letter: R
- Third letter: I
- First, fourth, fifth letters: must not be A,B,C,E,K,N,S and also should be different.

Possible letters: We have almost half the alphabet excluded. Remaining letters include: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need common ones.

Structure: _ R I _ _

We need to form a word with this pattern.

Common words that fit:
- TRICK? But has C and K -> absent? C and K are absent -> not allowed? Actually, we know C and K are absent, so they cannot be in the word. ""Trick"" contains C and K -> not valid because the secret word doesn't have them? No, the guess can contain these letters, but they will be marked as absent, which we already know, so inefficient. So better avoid.

Similarly, we should avoid all absent letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S.

Possible words:

- FRUIT: F-R-U-I-T? But we have I in third? ""fruit"" is F R U I T? So positions: F(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), T(5). But we need third letter to be I? Here it would be U in third and I in fourth? Not matching.

We require the third letter to be I.

So words with pattern: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5]

List words: 
- DRIVE: D R I V E -> but E is absent -> avoid E? Guess can use E but it will be marked x since absent. But V and D are new? Still, it wastes a slot. Better not.

- GRILL: G R I L L -> no absent letters? G, L are new? L appears twice. But structure: G(1), R(2), I(3), L(4), L(5). But L repeated? Okay.

- CRIES? But C and E are absent -> avoid.

Avoiding absent letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S.

So possible words:
- PRIDE: P R I D E -> E is absent -> inefficient.
- BRIDE? Has B and E -> both absent.

Better options:

- GRIEF? G R I E F -> E present? But E absent -> not good.
- THRIP? Not a word.

Common words:
- ""PRIMO"": P R I M O -> letters: P, R, I, M, O. All new? Avoids absent? P, M, O not absent. Yes. ""primo"" is a word.

- ""ORBIT""? O R B I T -> but B is absent, and also pattern: O R B I T -> I is fourth? No, we need I in third.

Requires R in second and I in third.

So:

- ""PRISM"": but S is absent? We know S is absent from ""brisk"" feedback. So ""prism"" has S -> avoid.

- ""OPIUM"": O P I U M -> but I is third? Positions: O(1), P(2), I(3) U(4) M(5)? But second letter is P, not R? No, pattern must be R in second.

What about ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> E absent? Avoid.

Possible:

- ""FRIED"": same issue.

With no absent letters:

- ""CRIME"": C absent? Avoid.

Since B and K are absent, words like ""brick"" are out.

Another: ""GRILL"": G R I L L? Yes, G(1), R(2), I(3), L(4), L(5). Letters: G, R, I, L. L repeated? Okay.

But ""GRILL"" has only four distinct letters? But that's fine.

- ""TRILL"": T R I L L? Same pattern.

- ""DRIFT"": D R I F T -> F and T new? But avoids absent? Yes? F and T are not known absent? Wait, A, B, C, E, K, N, S are absent, so F, D, T are okay.

But ""drift"" has D, R, I, F, T.

But fourth letter F and fifth T.

Or ""GRAFT"" but A absent -> invalid.

Another: ""FRISK"": F R I S K -> S and K absent? We know S and K are absent -> so letters will be marked x, inefficient.

We want to use only letters not known to be absent.

So words like:
- GRILL: G, R, I, L
- TRILL: T, R, I, L
- DRILL: D, R, I, L
- SKILL? But S and K absent -> avoid.

""ORIGIN""? Too many letters? 6 letters.

5-letter words:

- ""DROID"": D R O I D -> I is fourth? Pattern: D(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), D(5) -> third letter O, not I? We need third to be I.

Hard to find with I in third.

""IRISH""? But I R I S H -> I(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), H(5)? Yes, but S is absent? And also has I twice? But S is absent -> we avoid S.

Letters: H is new? But S is absent.

Better not.

Another: ""PRIOR"": P R I O R -> letters P, R, I, O, R? Pattern: P(1), R(2), I(3), O(4), R(5). R repeated? Okay. Letters: P, O, I, R. Avoids absent? P, O, I, R? But R is already known. Absent letters are A,B,C,E,K,N,S. So P, O are new? Yes.

""PRIOR"" is a word.

Similarly, ""GRIMY"": G R I M Y? G(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), Y(5). No absent letters? G, M, Y are unknown.

""PRIVY""?: P R I V Y? V and Y new.

""PRIMO"": P R I M O? M and O.

Many possibilities.

Now, another important point: In ""brisk"", S(4) was marked x, meaning no S in the word? And K(5) x, no K.

Also, from ""crane"", C(1)x, A(3)x, N(4)x, E(5)x.

But we have new constraints.

To be efficient, we should choose a word that tests letters we haven't tried.

Known present: R and I, and I is at position 3.

Possible letters for first, fourth, fifth: any letter not A,B,C,E,K,N,S.

Common among these: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z? Etc.

But we don't want to guess randomly; we want to reduce possibilities.

Also, since I is in third, and we have to fill others.

Possible words:
- ""PRION"": P R I O N? But N is absent -> avoid.
- ""PRIZE"": P R I Z E? E absent -> avoid.
- ""FRITZ"": F R I T Z? T and Z? Avoids absent? No E? So new letters.

But Z is rare.

Perhaps ""GRIOT"": G R I O T? O and T? ""griot"" is a word? Yes, a historian/storyteller.

So possibilities: ""GRILL"", ""TRILL"", ""DRILL"", ""PRIOR"", ""GRIMY"", ""PRIVY"", ""GRIOT"", ""THRILL""? Too long.

""THRIL""? Not a word.

Or ""SHRILL""? But S and H? S absent -> avoid S.

Therefore, I need to choose one.

To maximize information, we can choose a word with three new distinct letters? Since pattern _ R I _ _, and R and I known.

But in the blank, we have position 1,4,5.

So three positions to test new letters.

For example, ""PRIVY"": tests P, V, Y.

""GRIMY"": tests G, M, Y.

""PRIOR"": tests P, O, R (but R repeated, so we test P and O? And confirmation of R? But R position 5 is new? Secret may not have R elsewhere? Not sure.

But we know R is present in position 2, but might be elsewhere? We don't know.

However, since we only have R at position 2 confirmed, and I at 3.

In ""PRIOR"", position 1: P, 4: O, 5: R. And R(5) might be present or not? But feedback will tell.

But it's okay.

Similarly, ""GRILL"" tests G, L, and L again? But only two distinct new.

So less information? Not ideal.

Therefore, choose a word with unique new letters.

""PRIVY"": P, V, Y? Uncommon? V and Y.

""GRIMY"": G, M, Y? Y somewhat common.

""TRUMY""? Not a word.

""VIRUS""? V I R U S? Pattern not matching.

Must have R second, I third.

""CRIMP""? C absent.

""WRING"": W R I N G? N absent -> avoid.

""FLING""? Not R second.

Another possibility: ""ORBIT"": O R B I T -> B absent? And I is fourth? No.

With R and I fixed.

What about ""URINE""? U R I N E? N and E absent -> avoid.

""ARGUE""? A absent.

""PROWL""? P R O W L -> O in third? But we need I in third.

Difficult.

I think ""GRIMY"" or ""PRIVY"" are okay.

Perhaps ""PITHY""? but R not present? Must have R second.

I have to use R in second.

Another word: ""CHIRP""? C absent.

Perhaps ""ORRIS""? Not 5? Or ""IRIDS""? Doesn't fit.

Common words: ""fruit"" has I fourth, not third.

Perhaps ""drink"": D R I N K? N and K absent -> avoid.

""DRILL"": D R I L L? L unknown. And L repeated? Avoids absent? D? Yes? D not absent.

So ""DRILL"": D R I L L? Tests D and L.

Letters: D, L. Only two distinct.

""DRIVE"": E at end? Absent.

""TRIPE"": T R I P E? E absent -> avoid T and P? T and P new? But E absent so fifth would be x.

Similarly, ""PRIME"": E absent? And M new? But ""prime"" ends with E? So ""prime"" has E? Avoid.

Without E: ""PRIMP""? ""primp"" ends with P? P R I M P? Pattern: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), P(5). Avoids absent? M and P. Also P repeated? Yes.

But we can test P, M.

Similarly, ""CRIMP"" but C absent.

""PRIMP"" is a word? Yes, meaning to dress or groom carefully.

So possible.

Now, choosing between:

- ""GRIMY"" : G, M, Y
- ""PRIVY"": P, V, Y
- ""PRIMP"": P, M, (P again)  -> only two new: P and M.

Since ""PRIMP"" has P repeated, it doesn't test an extra letter? Same as ""GRIMY"" for three distinct.

""GRIMY"" has G, M, Y: three distinct new letters.

Similarly ""PRIVY"" has P, V, Y.

To be most informative, I prefer ""GRIMY"" because M and Y are common.

V is less common, so ""GRIMY"" might be better.

Another option: ""WRITE"" W R I T E? E absent -> avoid.

""TRINE""? T R I N E? N and E absent.

So ""GRIMY"" seems good.

Or ""GRIOT"" is also good? G R I O T? T? Yes? Tests G, O, T.

Common.

Both are valid.

I'll go with ""GRIMY"".

Guess: grimy

<guess>grimy</guess>
</think>
Based on previous feedback:

- From ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  → Secret word has R in position 2, and no C, A, N, E.  
- From ""brisk"": B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)  
  → Secret word has R in position 2 (confirmed), I in position 3, and no B, S, K.  

Combined, we know:  
- The secret word pattern is: _ R I _ _  
- Absent letters: A, B, C, E, K, N, S  
- Must use only remaining letters (e.g., D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)  

For the next guess:  
- Choose a valid 5-letter English word fitting the pattern _ R I _ _ , avoiding absent letters.  
- Prioritize words with distinct new letters to maximize information (e.g., test G, M, Y).  
- Good candidates: ""GRIMY"" (tests G in position 1, M in position 4, Y in position 5).  

<guess>grimy</guess>",grimy,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
   - This means R is in the correct position (2nd letter), and C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

2. Guess ""brisk"": B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)
   - R is correct and in position 2 (as before).
   - I is correct and in position 3 (since in ""brisk"", I is the third letter).
   - B, S, K are not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The word is of the form: _ R I _ _
- Additionally, the letters that are absent: A, B, C, E, K, N, S. (Since they were marked x in positions where we didn't have duplicates.)

We must avoid these absent letters.

We also know that R is in the second position and I is in the third.

Now, we need to guess a 5-letter word with:
- Second letter: R
- Third letter: I
- First, fourth, fifth letters: must not be A,B,C,E,K,N,S and also should be different.

Possible letters: We have almost half the alphabet excluded. Remaining letters include: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need common ones.

Structure: _ R I _ _

We need to form a word with this pattern.

Common words that fit:
- TRICK? But has C and K -> absent? C and K are absent -> not allowed? Actually, we know C and K are absent, so they cannot be in the word. ""Trick"" contains C and K -> not valid because the secret word doesn't have them? No, the guess can contain these letters, but they will be marked as absent, which we already know, so inefficient. So better avoid.

Similarly, we should avoid all absent letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S.

Possible words:

- FRUIT: F-R-U-I-T? But we have I in third? ""fruit"" is F R U I T? So positions: F(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), T(5). But we need third letter to be I? Here it would be U in third and I in fourth? Not matching.

We require the third letter to be I.

So words with pattern: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5]

List words: 
- DRIVE: D R I V E -> but E is absent -> avoid E? Guess can use E but it will be marked x since absent. But V and D are new? Still, it wastes a slot. Better not.

- GRILL: G R I L L -> no absent letters? G, L are new? L appears twice. But structure: G(1), R(2), I(3), L(4), L(5). But L repeated? Okay.

- CRIES? But C and E are absent -> avoid.

Avoiding absent letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S.

So possible words:
- PRIDE: P R I D E -> E is absent -> inefficient.
- BRIDE? Has B and E -> both absent.

Better options:

- GRIEF? G R I E F -> E present? But E absent -> not good.
- THRIP? Not a word.

Common words:
- ""PRIMO"": P R I M O -> letters: P, R, I, M, O. All new? Avoids absent? P, M, O not absent. Yes. ""primo"" is a word.

- ""ORBIT""? O R B I T -> but B is absent, and also pattern: O R B I T -> I is fourth? No, we need I in third.

Requires R in second and I in third.

So:

- ""PRISM"": but S is absent? We know S is absent from ""brisk"" feedback. So ""prism"" has S -> avoid.

- ""OPIUM"": O P I U M -> but I is third? Positions: O(1), P(2), I(3) U(4) M(5)? But second letter is P, not R? No, pattern must be R in second.

What about ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> E absent? Avoid.

Possible:

- ""FRIED"": same issue.

With no absent letters:

- ""CRIME"": C absent? Avoid.

Since B and K are absent, words like ""brick"" are out.

Another: ""GRILL"": G R I L L? Yes, G(1), R(2), I(3), L(4), L(5). Letters: G, R, I, L. L repeated? Okay.

But ""GRILL"" has only four distinct letters? But that's fine.

- ""TRILL"": T R I L L? Same pattern.

- ""DRIFT"": D R I F T -> F and T new? But avoids absent? Yes? F and T are not known absent? Wait, A, B, C, E, K, N, S are absent, so F, D, T are okay.

But ""drift"" has D, R, I, F, T.

But fourth letter F and fifth T.

Or ""GRAFT"" but A absent -> invalid.

Another: ""FRISK"": F R I S K -> S and K absent? We know S and K are absent -> so letters will be marked x, inefficient.

We want to use only letters not known to be absent.

So words like:
- GRILL: G, R, I, L
- TRILL: T, R, I, L
- DRILL: D, R, I, L
- SKILL? But S and K absent -> avoid.

""ORIGIN""? Too many letters? 6 letters.

5-letter words:

- ""DROID"": D R O I D -> I is fourth? Pattern: D(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), D(5) -> third letter O, not I? We need third to be I.

Hard to find with I in third.

""IRISH""? But I R I S H -> I(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), H(5)? Yes, but S is absent? And also has I twice? But S is absent -> we avoid S.

Letters: H is new? But S is absent.

Better not.

Another: ""PRIOR"": P R I O R -> letters P, R, I, O, R? Pattern: P(1), R(2), I(3), O(4), R(5). R repeated? Okay. Letters: P, O, I, R. Avoids absent? P, O, I, R? But R is already known. Absent letters are A,B,C,E,K,N,S. So P, O are new? Yes.

""PRIOR"" is a word.

Similarly, ""GRIMY"": G R I M Y? G(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), Y(5). No absent letters? G, M, Y are unknown.

""PRIVY""?: P R I V Y? V and Y new.

""PRIMO"": P R I M O? M and O.

Many possibilities.

Now, another important point: In ""brisk"", S(4) was marked x, meaning no S in the word? And K(5) x, no K.

Also, from ""crane"", C(1)x, A(3)x, N(4)x, E(5)x.

But we have new constraints.

To be efficient, we should choose a word that tests letters we haven't tried.

Known present: R and I, and I is at position 3.

Possible letters for first, fourth, fifth: any letter not A,B,C,E,K,N,S.

Common among these: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z? Etc.

But we don't want to guess randomly; we want to reduce possibilities.

Also, since I is in third, and we have to fill others.

Possible words:
- ""PRION"": P R I O N? But N is absent -> avoid.
- ""PRIZE"": P R I Z E? E absent -> avoid.
- ""FRITZ"": F R I T Z? T and Z? Avoids absent? No E? So new letters.

But Z is rare.

Perhaps ""GRIOT"": G R I O T? O and T? ""griot"" is a word? Yes, a historian/storyteller.

So possibilities: ""GRILL"", ""TRILL"", ""DRILL"", ""PRIOR"", ""GRIMY"", ""PRIVY"", ""GRIOT"", ""THRILL""? Too long.

""THRIL""? Not a word.

Or ""SHRILL""? But S and H? S absent -> avoid S.

Therefore, I need to choose one.

To maximize information, we can choose a word with three new distinct letters? Since pattern _ R I _ _, and R and I known.

But in the blank, we have position 1,4,5.

So three positions to test new letters.

For example, ""PRIVY"": tests P, V, Y.

""GRIMY"": tests G, M, Y.

""PRIOR"": tests P, O, R (but R repeated, so we test P and O? And confirmation of R? But R position 5 is new? Secret may not have R elsewhere? Not sure.

But we know R is present in position 2, but might be elsewhere? We don't know.

However, since we only have R at position 2 confirmed, and I at 3.

In ""PRIOR"", position 1: P, 4: O, 5: R. And R(5) might be present or not? But feedback will tell.

But it's okay.

Similarly, ""GRILL"" tests G, L, and L again? But only two distinct new.

So less information? Not ideal.

Therefore, choose a word with unique new letters.

""PRIVY"": P, V, Y? Uncommon? V and Y.

""GRIMY"": G, M, Y? Y somewhat common.

""TRUMY""? Not a word.

""VIRUS""? V I R U S? Pattern not matching.

Must have R second, I third.

""CRIMP""? C absent.

""WRING"": W R I N G? N absent -> avoid.

""FLING""? Not R second.

Another possibility: ""ORBIT"": O R B I T -> B absent? And I is fourth? No.

With R and I fixed.

What about ""URINE""? U R I N E? N and E absent -> avoid.

""ARGUE""? A absent.

""PROWL""? P R O W L -> O in third? But we need I in third.

Difficult.

I think ""GRIMY"" or ""PRIVY"" are okay.

Perhaps ""PITHY""? but R not present? Must have R second.

I have to use R in second.

Another word: ""CHIRP""? C absent.

Perhaps ""ORRIS""? Not 5? Or ""IRIDS""? Doesn't fit.

Common words: ""fruit"" has I fourth, not third.

Perhaps ""drink"": D R I N K? N and K absent -> avoid.

""DRILL"": D R I L L? L unknown. And L repeated? Avoids absent? D? Yes? D not absent.

So ""DRILL"": D R I L L? Tests D and L.

Letters: D, L. Only two distinct.

""DRIVE"": E at end? Absent.

""TRIPE"": T R I P E? E absent -> avoid T and P? T and P new? But E absent so fifth would be x.

Similarly, ""PRIME"": E absent? And M new? But ""prime"" ends with E? So ""prime"" has E? Avoid.

Without E: ""PRIMP""? ""primp"" ends with P? P R I M P? Pattern: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), P(5). Avoids absent? M and P. Also P repeated? Yes.

But we can test P, M.

Similarly, ""CRIMP"" but C absent.

""PRIMP"" is a word? Yes, meaning to dress or groom carefully.

So possible.

Now, choosing between:

- ""GRIMY"" : G, M, Y
- ""PRIVY"": P, V, Y
- ""PRIMP"": P, M, (P again)  -> only two new: P and M.

Since ""PRIMP"" has P repeated, it doesn't test an extra letter? Same as ""GRIMY"" for three distinct.

""GRIMY"" has G, M, Y: three distinct new letters.

Similarly ""PRIVY"" has P, V, Y.

To be most informative, I prefer ""GRIMY"" because M and Y are common.

V is less common, so ""GRIMY"" might be better.

Another option: ""WRITE"" W R I T E? E absent -> avoid.

""TRINE""? T R I N E? N and E absent.

So ""GRIMY"" seems good.

Or ""GRIOT"" is also good? G R I O T? T? Yes? Tests G, O, T.

Common.

Both are valid.

I'll go with ""GRIMY"".

Guess: grimy

<guess>grimy</guess>Based on previous feedback:

- From ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  → Secret word has R in position 2, and no C, A, N, E.  
- From ""brisk"": B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)  
  → Secret word has R in position 2 (confirmed), I in position 3, and no B, S, K.  

Combined, we know:  
- The secret word pattern is: _ R I _ _  
- Absent letters: A, B, C, E, K, N, S  
- Must use only remaining letters (e.g., D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)  

For the next guess:  
- Choose a valid 5-letter English word fitting the pattern _ R I _ _ , avoiding absent letters.  
- Prioritize words with distinct new letters to maximize information (e.g., test G, M, Y).  
- Good candidates: ""GRIMY"" (tests G in position 1, M in position 4, Y in position 5).",Guess 3: grimy -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,PRIMO,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

This means:
- R is correct and in the correct position (position 2, since ""crane"" is c-r-a-n-e).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So, the secret word has R as the second letter, and does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Since the word has R in the second position, and we know which letters are absent, we can try to form a new guess.

We need a 5-letter word that has R in the second position, and avoids C, A, N, E.

Common letters that might appear: let's think of vowels and consonants that are not excluded. Vowels: since A and E are out, we have I, O, U. Also Y can sometimes be a vowel.

We can try to use other common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

A good approach might be to use a word that includes letters we haven't tested yet, so we can get more information.

Possible words with R in the second position?

Let me think of some words: 
- b_r__ : like ""brick"", ""bring"", but we must avoid A, E, N? Actually, we know N and E are absent, so avoid them.
But also, we haven't tested B? So that might be okay.

Alternatively, we can try words like ""proud"", but R is second and we have O and U.

But let's list possible words.

We shouldn't reuse the absent letters.

So, absent letters: C, A, N, E.

Also, we know that the first, third, fourth, and fifth letters are not C, A, N, E, and they don't contain R? Well R is in the second position, so other positions could have other letters.

We need to maximize new letter information.

Let me try to think of a word with R in the second position and as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

Let me try ""proud"": 
- p, r (correct), o, u, d
But we don't know about these letters.

Another idea: ""storm"" - S, T, O, R, M. But R is in the second position? ""storm"" is s-t-o-r-m? Wait, no: s-t-o-r-m would have R in the fourth position? 

We need R to be in the second position. So examples:
- brick: b-r-i-c-k -> but c is already known absent? So we cannot use C.

Similarly, let think:
- ""bring"": b-r-i-n-g -> but n is absent, so invalid because we know n is not in the word? The guess must be a valid word, but ""bring"" contains N and we know N is absent? But the feedback says N is absent? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had N(x) meaning N is not in the word. So if we use a word containing N, then we know one letter would be x and we already know N is absent? It's inefficient because we already know N is absent.

So better to avoid letters that we know are absent.

So avoid C, A, N, E.

Possible words with structure: _ R _ _ _

We can try ""dirty"": d-i-r-t-y? No, R should be second. So d-r? ""dirty"" is d-i-r-t-y -> R is third? That's not second.

What are some words with R in the second position?

Examples:
- bread: but contains E and A, which are absent -> not allowed? We know E and A are absent, so we cannot use them.

We must avoid letters that are known absent? No, we can use them, but they will be marked x and we gain no new information. So it's better to avoid them to learn about new letters.

So let's list words that have R as second letter and do not contain C, A, N, E.

Possible letters: b, d, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, o, p, q, r? R is already in the word, but we can use R only once? Not necessarily, but since R is confirmed correct and it is only second, it might appear elsewhere? But usually Wordle allows words with duplicate letters? I think so, but we don't know if the secret word has duplicates.

But in this case, for guessing, we can use duplicate letters, but avoid known absent ones.

But we know R is present and in position 2, so the other R? We don't know.

To keep it simple, let's assume we avoid known absent and use new letters.

Common words: 
- ""proxy"": p-r-o-x-y -> no A,E,N,C? It has O and X, but X is less common. But we haven't tested O, P, X, Y.

Another: ""proud"": p-r-o-u-d -> has O, U, D, P. Avoids absent letters.

""froze"": f-r-o-z-e -> but E is absent? E is last letter, but we know E is absent, so using it would be x, which we already know. So better not to use E.

Similarly, ""crowd"": c is absent and w is new? But C is absent, so we know it will be x.

So let's list without A,C,N,E.

Possible words: 
- ""proud"": p-r-o-u-d
- ""group"": but R is second? g-r-o-u-p -> that's R in second? G is first, R second, then O,U,P. But ""group"" is 5 letters? g-r-o-u-p, yes.

However, ""group"" has O and U.

Another: ""truck"": but C and U? U is okay, but C is absent -> not good.

""fruit"": f-r-u-i-t -> has U and I.

""brisk"": b-r-i-s-k -> has I and S.

""draft"": d-r-a-f-t -> but A is absent -> avoid.

So one good candidate is ""brisk"": b-r-i-s-k.

We haven't tested B, I, S, K.

Similarly, ""guild"": but R? No, ""guild"" has u,i,l,d? Not R second.

So let's consider ""brisk"".

Another option: ""prism"": p-r-i-s-m -> has P, I, S, M.

We can compare:

I want to include common vowels: since A and E are absent, we have O, I, U.

So ""brisk"" has I, which is a vowel.

Also, ""proud"" has O and U.

""fruit"" has U and I.

Let me choose one that covers more vowels.

Since we have R fixed at second, let's try to include I and O? But we can't cover all at once.

We can choose one that also has common consonants.

Common consonants: T, L, S, P, etc.

So ""prism"" might be good: p-r-i-s-m -> letters P, R (known), I, S, M.

Or ""trope"": t-r-o-p-e -> but E is absent? Last letter E will be x, and we know it. So we lose information on one letter.

Similarly, ""trump"": t-r-u-m-p -> U and M.

But ""trump"" has T, R, U, M, P.

So let's decide.

I think ""brisk"" is good because it has B, I, S, K, and avoids known absent letters.

Similarly, ""prick"" has C which is absent -> no.

""bring"" has N absent -> avoid.

So I'll go with ""brisk"".

So my guess is ""brisk"".

Let's think: ""proxy"" is also good: p-r-o-x-y -> we can test O and Y, and X is less common but still.

But ""brisk"" has more common letters.

Perhaps ""straw"": s-t-r-a-w -> but A is absent -> avoid.

Therefore, ""brisk"" seems a good guess.

So I'll guess ""brisk"".

<guess>brisk</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is correct and in the correct position (second letter).
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.

For the next guess:
- The word must have R in the second position.
- It should avoid using C, A, N, or E to maximize new information.
- Focus on testing common unverified letters like B, I, S, K, O, U, etc.

I chose ""brisk"" because:
- It has R in the second position.
- It introduces new common letters: B (first position), I (third), S (fourth), K (fifth).
- These letters haven't been tested yet and are relatively frequent in English words.
- It avoids absent letters C, A, N, E.

This guess will provide feedback on whether B, I, S, or K are in the secret word and their positions, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

<guess>brisk</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
   - This means R is in the correct position (2nd letter), and C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

2. Guess ""brisk"": B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)
   - R is correct and in position 2 (as before).
   - I is correct and in position 3 (since in ""brisk"", I is the third letter).
   - B, S, K are not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The word is of the form: _ R I _ _
- Additionally, the letters that are absent: A, B, C, E, K, N, S. (Since they were marked x in positions where we didn't have duplicates.)

We must avoid these absent letters.

We also know that R is in the second position and I is in the third.

Now, we need to guess a 5-letter word with:
- Second letter: R
- Third letter: I
- First, fourth, fifth letters: must not be A,B,C,E,K,N,S and also should be different.

Possible letters: We have almost half the alphabet excluded. Remaining letters include: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need common ones.

Structure: _ R I _ _

We need to form a word with this pattern.

Common words that fit:
- TRICK? But has C and K -> absent? C and K are absent -> not allowed? Actually, we know C and K are absent, so they cannot be in the word. ""Trick"" contains C and K -> not valid because the secret word doesn't have them? No, the guess can contain these letters, but they will be marked as absent, which we already know, so inefficient. So better avoid.

Similarly, we should avoid all absent letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S.

Possible words:

- FRUIT: F-R-U-I-T? But we have I in third? ""fruit"" is F R U I T? So positions: F(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), T(5). But we need third letter to be I? Here it would be U in third and I in fourth? Not matching.

We require the third letter to be I.

So words with pattern: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5]

List words: 
- DRIVE: D R I V E -> but E is absent -> avoid E? Guess can use E but it will be marked x since absent. But V and D are new? Still, it wastes a slot. Better not.

- GRILL: G R I L L -> no absent letters? G, L are new? L appears twice. But structure: G(1), R(2), I(3), L(4), L(5). But L repeated? Okay.

- CRIES? But C and E are absent -> avoid.

Avoiding absent letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S.

So possible words:
- PRIDE: P R I D E -> E is absent -> inefficient.
- BRIDE? Has B and E -> both absent.

Better options:

- GRIEF? G R I E F -> E present? But E absent -> not good.
- THRIP? Not a word.

Common words:
- ""PRIMO"": P R I M O -> letters: P, R, I, M, O. All new? Avoids absent? P, M, O not absent. Yes. ""primo"" is a word.

- ""ORBIT""? O R B I T -> but B is absent, and also pattern: O R B I T -> I is fourth? No, we need I in third.

Requires R in second and I in third.

So:

- ""PRISM"": but S is absent? We know S is absent from ""brisk"" feedback. So ""prism"" has S -> avoid.

- ""OPIUM"": O P I U M -> but I is third? Positions: O(1), P(2), I(3) U(4) M(5)? But second letter is P, not R? No, pattern must be R in second.

What about ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> E absent? Avoid.

Possible:

- ""FRIED"": same issue.

With no absent letters:

- ""CRIME"": C absent? Avoid.

Since B and K are absent, words like ""brick"" are out.

Another: ""GRILL"": G R I L L? Yes, G(1), R(2), I(3), L(4), L(5). Letters: G, R, I, L. L repeated? Okay.

But ""GRILL"" has only four distinct letters? But that's fine.

- ""TRILL"": T R I L L? Same pattern.

- ""DRIFT"": D R I F T -> F and T new? But avoids absent? Yes? F and T are not known absent? Wait, A, B, C, E, K, N, S are absent, so F, D, T are okay.

But ""drift"" has D, R, I, F, T.

But fourth letter F and fifth T.

Or ""GRAFT"" but A absent -> invalid.

Another: ""FRISK"": F R I S K -> S and K absent? We know S and K are absent -> so letters will be marked x, inefficient.

We want to use only letters not known to be absent.

So words like:
- GRILL: G, R, I, L
- TRILL: T, R, I, L
- DRILL: D, R, I, L
- SKILL? But S and K absent -> avoid.

""ORIGIN""? Too many letters? 6 letters.

5-letter words:

- ""DROID"": D R O I D -> I is fourth? Pattern: D(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), D(5) -> third letter O, not I? We need third to be I.

Hard to find with I in third.

""IRISH""? But I R I S H -> I(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), H(5)? Yes, but S is absent? And also has I twice? But S is absent -> we avoid S.

Letters: H is new? But S is absent.

Better not.

Another: ""PRIOR"": P R I O R -> letters P, R, I, O, R? Pattern: P(1), R(2), I(3), O(4), R(5). R repeated? Okay. Letters: P, O, I, R. Avoids absent? P, O, I, R? But R is already known. Absent letters are A,B,C,E,K,N,S. So P, O are new? Yes.

""PRIOR"" is a word.

Similarly, ""GRIMY"": G R I M Y? G(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), Y(5). No absent letters? G, M, Y are unknown.

""PRIVY""?: P R I V Y? V and Y new.

""PRIMO"": P R I M O? M and O.

Many possibilities.

Now, another important point: In ""brisk"", S(4) was marked x, meaning no S in the word? And K(5) x, no K.

Also, from ""crane"", C(1)x, A(3)x, N(4)x, E(5)x.

But we have new constraints.

To be efficient, we should choose a word that tests letters we haven't tried.

Known present: R and I, and I is at position 3.

Possible letters for first, fourth, fifth: any letter not A,B,C,E,K,N,S.

Common among these: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z? Etc.

But we don't want to guess randomly; we want to reduce possibilities.

Also, since I is in third, and we have to fill others.

Possible words:
- ""PRION"": P R I O N? But N is absent -> avoid.
- ""PRIZE"": P R I Z E? E absent -> avoid.
- ""FRITZ"": F R I T Z? T and Z? Avoids absent? No E? So new letters.

But Z is rare.

Perhaps ""GRIOT"": G R I O T? O and T? ""griot"" is a word? Yes, a historian/storyteller.

So possibilities: ""GRILL"", ""TRILL"", ""DRILL"", ""PRIOR"", ""GRIMY"", ""PRIVY"", ""GRIOT"", ""THRILL""? Too long.

""THRIL""? Not a word.

Or ""SHRILL""? But S and H? S absent -> avoid S.

Therefore, I need to choose one.

To maximize information, we can choose a word with three new distinct letters? Since pattern _ R I _ _, and R and I known.

But in the blank, we have position 1,4,5.

So three positions to test new letters.

For example, ""PRIVY"": tests P, V, Y.

""GRIMY"": tests G, M, Y.

""PRIOR"": tests P, O, R (but R repeated, so we test P and O? And confirmation of R? But R position 5 is new? Secret may not have R elsewhere? Not sure.

But we know R is present in position 2, but might be elsewhere? We don't know.

However, since we only have R at position 2 confirmed, and I at 3.

In ""PRIOR"", position 1: P, 4: O, 5: R. And R(5) might be present or not? But feedback will tell.

But it's okay.

Similarly, ""GRILL"" tests G, L, and L again? But only two distinct new.

So less information? Not ideal.

Therefore, choose a word with unique new letters.

""PRIVY"": P, V, Y? Uncommon? V and Y.

""GRIMY"": G, M, Y? Y somewhat common.

""TRUMY""? Not a word.

""VIRUS""? V I R U S? Pattern not matching.

Must have R second, I third.

""CRIMP""? C absent.

""WRING"": W R I N G? N absent -> avoid.

""FLING""? Not R second.

Another possibility: ""ORBIT"": O R B I T -> B absent? And I is fourth? No.

With R and I fixed.

What about ""URINE""? U R I N E? N and E absent -> avoid.

""ARGUE""? A absent.

""PROWL""? P R O W L -> O in third? But we need I in third.

Difficult.

I think ""GRIMY"" or ""PRIVY"" are okay.

Perhaps ""PITHY""? but R not present? Must have R second.

I have to use R in second.

Another word: ""CHIRP""? C absent.

Perhaps ""ORRIS""? Not 5? Or ""IRIDS""? Doesn't fit.

Common words: ""fruit"" has I fourth, not third.

Perhaps ""drink"": D R I N K? N and K absent -> avoid.

""DRILL"": D R I L L? L unknown. And L repeated? Avoids absent? D? Yes? D not absent.

So ""DRILL"": D R I L L? Tests D and L.

Letters: D, L. Only two distinct.

""DRIVE"": E at end? Absent.

""TRIPE"": T R I P E? E absent -> avoid T and P? T and P new? But E absent so fifth would be x.

Similarly, ""PRIME"": E absent? And M new? But ""prime"" ends with E? So ""prime"" has E? Avoid.

Without E: ""PRIMP""? ""primp"" ends with P? P R I M P? Pattern: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), P(5). Avoids absent? M and P. Also P repeated? Yes.

But we can test P, M.

Similarly, ""CRIMP"" but C absent.

""PRIMP"" is a word? Yes, meaning to dress or groom carefully.

So possible.

Now, choosing between:

- ""GRIMY"" : G, M, Y
- ""PRIVY"": P, V, Y
- ""PRIMP"": P, M, (P again)  -> only two new: P and M.

Since ""PRIMP"" has P repeated, it doesn't test an extra letter? Same as ""GRIMY"" for three distinct.

""GRIMY"" has G, M, Y: three distinct new letters.

Similarly ""PRIVY"" has P, V, Y.

To be most informative, I prefer ""GRIMY"" because M and Y are common.

V is less common, so ""GRIMY"" might be better.

Another option: ""WRITE"" W R I T E? E absent -> avoid.

""TRINE""? T R I N E? N and E absent.

So ""GRIMY"" seems good.

Or ""GRIOT"" is also good? G R I O T? T? Yes? Tests G, O, T.

Common.

Both are valid.

I'll go with ""GRIMY"".

Guess: grimy

<guess>grimy</guess>Based on previous feedback:

- From ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  → Secret word has R in position 2, and no C, A, N, E.  
- From ""brisk"": B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)  
  → Secret word has R in position 2 (confirmed), I in position 3, and no B, S, K.  

Combined, we know:  
- The secret word pattern is: _ R I _ _  
- Absent letters: A, B, C, E, K, N, S  
- Must use only remaining letters (e.g., D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)  

For the next guess:  
- Choose a valid 5-letter English word fitting the pattern _ R I _ _ , avoiding absent letters.  
- Prioritize words with distinct new letters to maximize information (e.g., test G, M, Y).  
- Good candidates: ""GRIMY"" (tests G in position 1, M in position 4, Y in position 5).

Vowels: since A and E are out, we have I, O, U. Also Y can sometimes be a vowel.\n\nWe can try to use other common consonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\nA good approach might be to use a word that includes letters we haven\'t tested yet, so we can get more information.\n\nPossible words with R in the second position?\n\nLet me think of some words: \n- b_r__ : like ""brick"", ""bring"", but we must avoid A, E, N? Actually, we know N and E are absent, so avoid them.\nBut also, we haven\'t tested B? So that might be okay.\n\nAlternatively, we can try words like ""proud"", but R is second and we have O and U.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words.\n\nWe shouldn\'t reuse the absent letters.\n\nSo, absent letters: C, A, N, E.\n\nAlso, we know that the first, third, fourth, and fifth letters are not C, A, N, E, and they don\'t contain R? Well R is in the second position, so other positions could have other letters.\n\nWe need to maximize new letter information.\n\nLet me try to think of a word with R in the second position and as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nLet me try ""proud"": \n- p, r (correct), o, u, d\nBut we don\'t know about these letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""storm"" - S, T, O, R, M. But R is in the second position? ""storm"" is s-t-o-r-m? Wait, no: s-t-o-r-m would have R in the fourth position? \n\nWe need R to be in the second position. So examples:\n- brick: b-r-i-c-k -> but c is already known absent? So we cannot use C.\n\nSimilarly, let think:\n- ""bring"": b-r-i-n-g -> but n is absent, so invalid because we know n is not in the word? The guess must be a valid word, but ""bring"" contains N and we know N is absent? But the feedback says N is absent? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had N(x) meaning N is not in the word. So if we use a word containing N, then we know one letter would be x and we already know N is absent? It\'s inefficient because we already know N is absent.\n\nSo better to avoid letters that we know are absent.\n\nSo avoid C, A, N, E.\n\nPossible words with structure: _ R _ _ _\n\nWe can try ""dirty"": d-i-r-t-y? No, R should be second. So d-r? ""dirty"" is d-i-r-t-y -> R is third? That\'s not second.\n\nWhat are some words with R in the second position?\n\nExamples:\n- bread: but contains E and A, which are absent -> not allowed? We know E and A are absent, so we cannot use them.\n\nWe must avoid letters that are known absent? No, we can use them, but they will be marked x and we gain no new information. So it\'s better to avoid them to learn about new letters.\n\nSo let\'s list words that have R as second letter and do not contain C, A, N, E.\n\nPossible letters: b, d, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, o, p, q, r? R is already in the word, but we can use R only once? Not necessarily, but since R is confirmed correct and it is only second, it might appear elsewhere? But usually Wordle allows words with duplicate letters? I think so, but we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicates.\n\nBut in this case, for guessing, we can use duplicate letters, but avoid known absent ones.\n\nBut we know R is present and in position 2, so the other R? We don\'t know.\n\nTo keep it simple, let\'s assume we avoid known absent and use new letters.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""proxy"": p-r-o-x-y -> no A,E,N,C? It has O and X, but X is less common. But we haven\'t tested O, P, X, Y.\n\nAnother: ""proud"": p-r-o-u-d -> has O, U, D, P. Avoids absent letters.\n\n""froze"": f-r-o-z-e -> but E is absent? E is last letter, but we know E is absent, so using it would be x, which we already know. So better not to use E.\n\nSimilarly, ""crowd"": c is absent and w is new? But C is absent, so we know it will be x.\n\nSo let\'s list without A,C,N,E.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""proud"": p-r-o-u-d\n- ""group"": but R is second? g-r-o-u-p -> that\'s R in second? G is first, R second, then O,U,P. But ""group"" is 5 letters? g-r-o-u-p, yes.\n\nHowever, ""group"" has O and U.\n\nAnother: ""truck"": but C and U? U is okay, but C is absent -> not good.\n\n""fruit"": f-r-u-i-t -> has U and I.\n\n""brisk"": b-r-i-s-k -> has I and S.\n\n""draft"": d-r-a-f-t -> but A is absent -> avoid.\n\nSo one good candidate is ""brisk"": b-r-i-s-k.\n\nWe haven\'t tested B, I, S, K.\n\nSimilarly, ""guild"": but R? No, ""guild"" has u,i,l,d? Not R second.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""brisk"".\n\nAnother option: ""prism"": p-r-i-s-m -> has P, I, S, M.\n\nWe can compare:\n\nI want to include common vowels: since A and E are absent, we have O, I, U.\n\nSo ""brisk"" has I, which is a vowel.\n\nAlso, ""proud"" has O and U.\n\n""fruit"" has U and I.\n\nLet me choose one that covers more vowels.\n\nSince we have R fixed at second, let\'s try to include I and O? But we can\'t cover all at once.\n\nWe can choose one that also has common consonants.\n\nCommon consonants: T, L, S, P, etc.\n\nSo ""prism"" might be good: p-r-i-s-m -> letters P, R (known), I, S, M.\n\nOr ""trope"": t-r-o-p-e -> but E is absent? Last letter E will be x, and we know it. So we lose information on one letter.\n\nSimilarly, ""trump"": t-r-u-m-p -> U and M.\n\nBut ""trump"" has T, R, U, M, P.\n\nSo let\'s decide.\n\nI think ""brisk"" is good because it has B, I, S, K, and avoids known absent letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""prick"" has C which is absent -> no.\n\n""bring"" has N absent -> avoid.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""brisk"".\n\nSo my guess is ""brisk"".\n\nLet\'s think: ""proxy"" is also good: p-r-o-x-y -> we can test O and Y, and X is less common but still.\n\nBut ""brisk"" has more common letters.\n\nPerhaps ""straw"": s-t-r-a-w -> but A is absent -> avoid.\n\nTherefore, ""brisk"" seems a good guess.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""brisk"".\n\n<guess>brisk</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is correct and in the correct position (second letter).\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must have R in the second position.\n- It should avoid using C, A, N, or E to maximize new information.\n- Focus on testing common unverified letters like B, I, S, K, O, U, etc.\n\nI chose ""brisk"" because:\n- It has R in the second position.\n- It introduces new common letters: B (first position), I (third), S (fourth), K (fifth).\n- These letters haven\'t been tested yet and are relatively frequent in English words.\n- It avoids absent letters C, A, N, E.\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on whether B, I, S, or K are in the secret word and their positions, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.\n\n<guess>brisk</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1.

Actually, we know C and K are absent, so they cannot be in the word. ""Trick"" contains C and K -> not valid because the secret word doesn\'t have them? No, the guess can contain these letters, but they will be marked as absent, which we already know, so inefficient. So better avoid.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid all absent letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- FRUIT: F-R-U-I-T? But we have I in third? ""fruit"" is F R U I T? So positions: F(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), T(5). But we need third letter to be I? Here it would be U in third and I in fourth?

O and T? ""griot"" is a word? Yes, a historian/storyteller.\n\nSo possibilities: ""GRILL"", ""TRILL"", ""DRILL"", ""PRIOR"", ""GRIMY"", ""PRIVY"", ""GRIOT"", ""THRILL""? Too long.\n\n""THRIL""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""SHRILL""? But S and H? S absent -> avoid S.\n\nTherefore, I need to choose one.\n\nTo maximize information, we can choose a word with three new distinct letters? Since pattern _ R I _ _, and R and I known.\n\nBut in the blank, we have position 1,4,5.\n\nSo three positions to test new letters.\n\nFor example, ""PRIVY"": tests P, V, Y.\n\n""GRIMY"": tests G, M, Y.\n\n""PRIOR"": tests P, O, R (but R repeated, so we test P and O?

We have feedback from three guesses:
1. Guess ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - R is in the correct position (position 2).
   - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

2. Guess ""brisk"": B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)
   - R is correct in position 2.
   - I is correct in position 3.
   - B, S, K are not in the word.

3. Guess ""grimy"": G(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) Y(x)
   - R and I are confirmed again in positions 2 and 3.
   - M is correct in position 4 (since M was in position 4 of ""grimy"").
   - G and Y are not in the word.

From all this feedback, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R I M _ 
  (because R in position 2, I in position 3, M in position 4).
- Positions:
    - Position 1: unknown, but not any of the absent letters.
    - Position 2: R
    - Position 3: I
    - Position 4: M
    - Position 5: unknown.

- Absent letters (from all x marks): A, B, C, E, G, K, N, S, Y.
  Specifically, from ""crane"": C, A, N, E; from ""brisk"": B, S, K; from ""grimy"": G, Y → so comprehensive absent list: A, B, C, E, G, K, N, S, Y.

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form: * R I M * 
Where the first and fifth positions must be filled with letters not in the absent set. 

Remaining possible letters (excluding absent): D, F, H, J, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to guess a 5-letter word that fits: _ R I M _

And we should avoid using absent letters to maximize useful feedback.

What are possible words?

We need to test possible letters for positions 1 and 5.

Common words fitting the pattern:
- ""DRIMP""? Not a word.
- ""SCRIM""? Only 5? S and C absent -> invalid.
- ""PRIM"" is 4 letters.

Actually, ""CRIMP""? But C absent -> avoid.

Words like:
- ""TRIMS"": T R I M S? But S is absent -> avoid.
- ""BRIMY"": B absent and Y? Also B and Y absent.
- ""DRIVE"": E absent -> avoid.

Since we know M is in position 4, and we need position 5.

A common word is ""TRIM"" but that's 4 letters. 

What about 5-letter words:
- ""PRIME"": P R I M E? But E is absent -> avoid.
- ""CRIME"": C absent? Avoid.
- ""GRIME"": G absent? Avoid.

Without absent letters, possible words are limited.

""ORIUM""? Not a word.

""QUIM"" not 5 letters.

Perhaps:
- ""FRISK""? Already guessed and S,K absent.
No.

Let's think of words ending in M:
Specifically, _ R I M _

Possible:
- ""DRINK""? N absent -> avoid.
- ""BRINK""? B absent -> avoid.
- ""THRIM""? Not a word.
- ""PRIMP"": P R I M P? Pattern: P R I M P? Positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:M, 5:P? But that's repetition? And is ""primp"" a word? Yes.

""primp"": meaning to dress smartly. Yes.

Thus, ""PRIMP"": P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), P(5). But P repeated? Possible.

Also, letters: P not absent? P hasn't been tested.

But we have position 1 and 5 both possibly P? But the secret may or may not have duplicate letters.

Another possibility: ""ORIX""? Not a word.

""SHRIM""? S absent -> avoid.

""VRILL""? Not a word.

""WRIM"" not.

Another word: ""IRIDS""? Not five? ""irids"" no.

Perhaps ""PRISM""? S absent -> avoid.

With M fixed at position 4, and no E, S, etc.

""TRIMS"": S absent -> avoid.

""CRIMP"": C absent -> avoid.

Therefore, ""PRIMP"" might be one of the few valid options.

Another is ""DRIMP""? Not a word.

Or ""TRAMP""? T R A M P -> A absent -> avoid.

""TRIBE"": B and E absent.

Not them.

What about ""WHIM"" not 5 letters.

""WHIMS""? S absent and 5? W H I M S? Positions: W H I? But we need R as second? No.

Pattern must be _ R I M _

So only word I can think of is ""primp"".

Also, ""BRIMS""? B and S absent -> avoid.

""SCRIP""? S and C absent.

So ""PRIMP"" is plausible.

Another: ""CRIBS""? C absent.

Hence, I am considering ""PRIMP"".

But let's confirm: the word is ""primp"". Its structure fits: P R I M P.

Letters: P is absent? No, we have not encountered P before. It's not in the absent list.

Similarly, M is already correct at position 4? So if we guess ""PRIMP"", we have:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: R (already known)
- Position 3: I (known)
- Position 4: M (known)
- Position 5: P

We will get feedback for P at position 1 and position 5.

If P is in the word, we'll know which position is correct? Or if present.

But since we are guessing the secret, and we have three unknowns: the first letter and the fifth letter.

By guessing ""primp"", we are saying both could be P? But the secret word might not have duplicate P? We don't know.

But we need to test this.

Alternatively, is there another word?

Another possibility: ""URINE""? But U R I N E? N and E absent -> avoid.

""GRIPS""? G absent -> avoid.

Perhaps ""PRICE""? C absent.

Another: ""TRIES""? E absent -> avoid.

I think ""primp"" is a valid choice.

If we want to test different letters, perhaps try a word with different endings.

But with the constraints, it's hard.

Another word: ""CHIMP""? C absent -> avoid.

""CLAMP""? But L? Pattern not R I.

No.

""TRIP"". Not 5 letters.

So I'll go with ""primp"".

Guess: primp

But in the pattern, position 4 is M? And ""primp"" uses M for position 4? Yes.

We know M is correct at position 4, so if the secret word is ""primp"", then position 4 is M? Yes.

But we are guessing to see if it's correct.

Perhaps there is another word like ""DRUM""? Not fitting pattern.

Or ""FRUIT""? U in wrong position? F R U I T? Pattern F R U I T? Position 3 is U? But we need I at position 3? So doesn't fit.

Hence ""primp"" seems a solid guess.

So <guess>primp</guess>

- **Possible letters for POS1 and POS5**: D, F, H, J, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.  

To solve efficiently:  
- The pattern `[POS1] R I M [POS5]` must be filled with allowed letters.  
- Avoid reusing absent letters to preserve guess quality.  
- The word ""PRIMP"" fits perfectly:  
  - P (position 1), R (position 2), I (position 3), M (position 4), P (position 5).  
  - P is untested and plausible for positions 1/5.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,PRIMO,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

This means:
- R is correct and in the correct position (position 2, since ""crane"" is c-r-a-n-e).
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

So, the secret word has R as the second letter, and does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Since the word has R in the second position, and we know which letters are absent, we can try to form a new guess.

We need a 5-letter word that has R in the second position, and avoids C, A, N, E.

Common letters that might appear: let's think of vowels and consonants that are not excluded. Vowels: since A and E are out, we have I, O, U. Also Y can sometimes be a vowel.

We can try to use other common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

A good approach might be to use a word that includes letters we haven't tested yet, so we can get more information.

Possible words with R in the second position?

Let me think of some words: 
- b_r__ : like ""brick"", ""bring"", but we must avoid A, E, N? Actually, we know N and E are absent, so avoid them.
But also, we haven't tested B? So that might be okay.

Alternatively, we can try words like ""proud"", but R is second and we have O and U.

But let's list possible words.

We shouldn't reuse the absent letters.

So, absent letters: C, A, N, E.

Also, we know that the first, third, fourth, and fifth letters are not C, A, N, E, and they don't contain R? Well R is in the second position, so other positions could have other letters.

We need to maximize new letter information.

Let me try to think of a word with R in the second position and as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

Let me try ""proud"": 
- p, r (correct), o, u, d
But we don't know about these letters.

Another idea: ""storm"" - S, T, O, R, M. But R is in the second position? ""storm"" is s-t-o-r-m? Wait, no: s-t-o-r-m would have R in the fourth position? 

We need R to be in the second position. So examples:
- brick: b-r-i-c-k -> but c is already known absent? So we cannot use C.

Similarly, let think:
- ""bring"": b-r-i-n-g -> but n is absent, so invalid because we know n is not in the word? The guess must be a valid word, but ""bring"" contains N and we know N is absent? But the feedback says N is absent? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had N(x) meaning N is not in the word. So if we use a word containing N, then we know one letter would be x and we already know N is absent? It's inefficient because we already know N is absent.

So better to avoid letters that we know are absent.

So avoid C, A, N, E.

Possible words with structure: _ R _ _ _

We can try ""dirty"": d-i-r-t-y? No, R should be second. So d-r? ""dirty"" is d-i-r-t-y -> R is third? That's not second.

What are some words with R in the second position?

Examples:
- bread: but contains E and A, which are absent -> not allowed? We know E and A are absent, so we cannot use them.

We must avoid letters that are known absent? No, we can use them, but they will be marked x and we gain no new information. So it's better to avoid them to learn about new letters.

So let's list words that have R as second letter and do not contain C, A, N, E.

Possible letters: b, d, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, o, p, q, r? R is already in the word, but we can use R only once? Not necessarily, but since R is confirmed correct and it is only second, it might appear elsewhere? But usually Wordle allows words with duplicate letters? I think so, but we don't know if the secret word has duplicates.

But in this case, for guessing, we can use duplicate letters, but avoid known absent ones.

But we know R is present and in position 2, so the other R? We don't know.

To keep it simple, let's assume we avoid known absent and use new letters.

Common words: 
- ""proxy"": p-r-o-x-y -> no A,E,N,C? It has O and X, but X is less common. But we haven't tested O, P, X, Y.

Another: ""proud"": p-r-o-u-d -> has O, U, D, P. Avoids absent letters.

""froze"": f-r-o-z-e -> but E is absent? E is last letter, but we know E is absent, so using it would be x, which we already know. So better not to use E.

Similarly, ""crowd"": c is absent and w is new? But C is absent, so we know it will be x.

So let's list without A,C,N,E.

Possible words: 
- ""proud"": p-r-o-u-d
- ""group"": but R is second? g-r-o-u-p -> that's R in second? G is first, R second, then O,U,P. But ""group"" is 5 letters? g-r-o-u-p, yes.

However, ""group"" has O and U.

Another: ""truck"": but C and U? U is okay, but C is absent -> not good.

""fruit"": f-r-u-i-t -> has U and I.

""brisk"": b-r-i-s-k -> has I and S.

""draft"": d-r-a-f-t -> but A is absent -> avoid.

So one good candidate is ""brisk"": b-r-i-s-k.

We haven't tested B, I, S, K.

Similarly, ""guild"": but R? No, ""guild"" has u,i,l,d? Not R second.

So let's consider ""brisk"".

Another option: ""prism"": p-r-i-s-m -> has P, I, S, M.

We can compare:

I want to include common vowels: since A and E are absent, we have O, I, U.

So ""brisk"" has I, which is a vowel.

Also, ""proud"" has O and U.

""fruit"" has U and I.

Let me choose one that covers more vowels.

Since we have R fixed at second, let's try to include I and O? But we can't cover all at once.

We can choose one that also has common consonants.

Common consonants: T, L, S, P, etc.

So ""prism"" might be good: p-r-i-s-m -> letters P, R (known), I, S, M.

Or ""trope"": t-r-o-p-e -> but E is absent? Last letter E will be x, and we know it. So we lose information on one letter.

Similarly, ""trump"": t-r-u-m-p -> U and M.

But ""trump"" has T, R, U, M, P.

So let's decide.

I think ""brisk"" is good because it has B, I, S, K, and avoids known absent letters.

Similarly, ""prick"" has C which is absent -> no.

""bring"" has N absent -> avoid.

So I'll go with ""brisk"".

So my guess is ""brisk"".

Let's think: ""proxy"" is also good: p-r-o-x-y -> we can test O and Y, and X is less common but still.

But ""brisk"" has more common letters.

Perhaps ""straw"": s-t-r-a-w -> but A is absent -> avoid.

Therefore, ""brisk"" seems a good guess.

So I'll guess ""brisk"".

<guess>brisk</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is correct and in the correct position (second letter).
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.

For the next guess:
- The word must have R in the second position.
- It should avoid using C, A, N, or E to maximize new information.
- Focus on testing common unverified letters like B, I, S, K, O, U, etc.

I chose ""brisk"" because:
- It has R in the second position.
- It introduces new common letters: B (first position), I (third), S (fourth), K (fifth).
- These letters haven't been tested yet and are relatively frequent in English words.
- It avoids absent letters C, A, N, E.

This guess will provide feedback on whether B, I, S, or K are in the secret word and their positions, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

<guess>brisk</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
   - This means R is in the correct position (2nd letter), and C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

2. Guess ""brisk"": B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)
   - R is correct and in position 2 (as before).
   - I is correct and in position 3 (since in ""brisk"", I is the third letter).
   - B, S, K are not in the word.

From this, we know:
- The word is of the form: _ R I _ _
- Additionally, the letters that are absent: A, B, C, E, K, N, S. (Since they were marked x in positions where we didn't have duplicates.)

We must avoid these absent letters.

We also know that R is in the second position and I is in the third.

Now, we need to guess a 5-letter word with:
- Second letter: R
- Third letter: I
- First, fourth, fifth letters: must not be A,B,C,E,K,N,S and also should be different.

Possible letters: We have almost half the alphabet excluded. Remaining letters include: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need common ones.

Structure: _ R I _ _

We need to form a word with this pattern.

Common words that fit:
- TRICK? But has C and K -> absent? C and K are absent -> not allowed? Actually, we know C and K are absent, so they cannot be in the word. ""Trick"" contains C and K -> not valid because the secret word doesn't have them? No, the guess can contain these letters, but they will be marked as absent, which we already know, so inefficient. So better avoid.

Similarly, we should avoid all absent letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S.

Possible words:

- FRUIT: F-R-U-I-T? But we have I in third? ""fruit"" is F R U I T? So positions: F(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), T(5). But we need third letter to be I? Here it would be U in third and I in fourth? Not matching.

We require the third letter to be I.

So words with pattern: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5]

List words: 
- DRIVE: D R I V E -> but E is absent -> avoid E? Guess can use E but it will be marked x since absent. But V and D are new? Still, it wastes a slot. Better not.

- GRILL: G R I L L -> no absent letters? G, L are new? L appears twice. But structure: G(1), R(2), I(3), L(4), L(5). But L repeated? Okay.

- CRIES? But C and E are absent -> avoid.

Avoiding absent letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S.

So possible words:
- PRIDE: P R I D E -> E is absent -> inefficient.
- BRIDE? Has B and E -> both absent.

Better options:

- GRIEF? G R I E F -> E present? But E absent -> not good.
- THRIP? Not a word.

Common words:
- ""PRIMO"": P R I M O -> letters: P, R, I, M, O. All new? Avoids absent? P, M, O not absent. Yes. ""primo"" is a word.

- ""ORBIT""? O R B I T -> but B is absent, and also pattern: O R B I T -> I is fourth? No, we need I in third.

Requires R in second and I in third.

So:

- ""PRISM"": but S is absent? We know S is absent from ""brisk"" feedback. So ""prism"" has S -> avoid.

- ""OPIUM"": O P I U M -> but I is third? Positions: O(1), P(2), I(3) U(4) M(5)? But second letter is P, not R? No, pattern must be R in second.

What about ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> E absent? Avoid.

Possible:

- ""FRIED"": same issue.

With no absent letters:

- ""CRIME"": C absent? Avoid.

Since B and K are absent, words like ""brick"" are out.

Another: ""GRILL"": G R I L L? Yes, G(1), R(2), I(3), L(4), L(5). Letters: G, R, I, L. L repeated? Okay.

But ""GRILL"" has only four distinct letters? But that's fine.

- ""TRILL"": T R I L L? Same pattern.

- ""DRIFT"": D R I F T -> F and T new? But avoids absent? Yes? F and T are not known absent? Wait, A, B, C, E, K, N, S are absent, so F, D, T are okay.

But ""drift"" has D, R, I, F, T.

But fourth letter F and fifth T.

Or ""GRAFT"" but A absent -> invalid.

Another: ""FRISK"": F R I S K -> S and K absent? We know S and K are absent -> so letters will be marked x, inefficient.

We want to use only letters not known to be absent.

So words like:
- GRILL: G, R, I, L
- TRILL: T, R, I, L
- DRILL: D, R, I, L
- SKILL? But S and K absent -> avoid.

""ORIGIN""? Too many letters? 6 letters.

5-letter words:

- ""DROID"": D R O I D -> I is fourth? Pattern: D(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), D(5) -> third letter O, not I? We need third to be I.

Hard to find with I in third.

""IRISH""? But I R I S H -> I(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), H(5)? Yes, but S is absent? And also has I twice? But S is absent -> we avoid S.

Letters: H is new? But S is absent.

Better not.

Another: ""PRIOR"": P R I O R -> letters P, R, I, O, R? Pattern: P(1), R(2), I(3), O(4), R(5). R repeated? Okay. Letters: P, O, I, R. Avoids absent? P, O, I, R? But R is already known. Absent letters are A,B,C,E,K,N,S. So P, O are new? Yes.

""PRIOR"" is a word.

Similarly, ""GRIMY"": G R I M Y? G(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), Y(5). No absent letters? G, M, Y are unknown.

""PRIVY""?: P R I V Y? V and Y new.

""PRIMO"": P R I M O? M and O.

Many possibilities.

Now, another important point: In ""brisk"", S(4) was marked x, meaning no S in the word? And K(5) x, no K.

Also, from ""crane"", C(1)x, A(3)x, N(4)x, E(5)x.

But we have new constraints.

To be efficient, we should choose a word that tests letters we haven't tried.

Known present: R and I, and I is at position 3.

Possible letters for first, fourth, fifth: any letter not A,B,C,E,K,N,S.

Common among these: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z? Etc.

But we don't want to guess randomly; we want to reduce possibilities.

Also, since I is in third, and we have to fill others.

Possible words:
- ""PRION"": P R I O N? But N is absent -> avoid.
- ""PRIZE"": P R I Z E? E absent -> avoid.
- ""FRITZ"": F R I T Z? T and Z? Avoids absent? No E? So new letters.

But Z is rare.

Perhaps ""GRIOT"": G R I O T? O and T? ""griot"" is a word? Yes, a historian/storyteller.

So possibilities: ""GRILL"", ""TRILL"", ""DRILL"", ""PRIOR"", ""GRIMY"", ""PRIVY"", ""GRIOT"", ""THRILL""? Too long.

""THRIL""? Not a word.

Or ""SHRILL""? But S and H? S absent -> avoid S.

Therefore, I need to choose one.

To maximize information, we can choose a word with three new distinct letters? Since pattern _ R I _ _, and R and I known.

But in the blank, we have position 1,4,5.

So three positions to test new letters.

For example, ""PRIVY"": tests P, V, Y.

""GRIMY"": tests G, M, Y.

""PRIOR"": tests P, O, R (but R repeated, so we test P and O? And confirmation of R? But R position 5 is new? Secret may not have R elsewhere? Not sure.

But we know R is present in position 2, but might be elsewhere? We don't know.

However, since we only have R at position 2 confirmed, and I at 3.

In ""PRIOR"", position 1: P, 4: O, 5: R. And R(5) might be present or not? But feedback will tell.

But it's okay.

Similarly, ""GRILL"" tests G, L, and L again? But only two distinct new.

So less information? Not ideal.

Therefore, choose a word with unique new letters.

""PRIVY"": P, V, Y? Uncommon? V and Y.

""GRIMY"": G, M, Y? Y somewhat common.

""TRUMY""? Not a word.

""VIRUS""? V I R U S? Pattern not matching.

Must have R second, I third.

""CRIMP""? C absent.

""WRING"": W R I N G? N absent -> avoid.

""FLING""? Not R second.

Another possibility: ""ORBIT"": O R B I T -> B absent? And I is fourth? No.

With R and I fixed.

What about ""URINE""? U R I N E? N and E absent -> avoid.

""ARGUE""? A absent.

""PROWL""? P R O W L -> O in third? But we need I in third.

Difficult.

I think ""GRIMY"" or ""PRIVY"" are okay.

Perhaps ""PITHY""? but R not present? Must have R second.

I have to use R in second.

Another word: ""CHIRP""? C absent.

Perhaps ""ORRIS""? Not 5? Or ""IRIDS""? Doesn't fit.

Common words: ""fruit"" has I fourth, not third.

Perhaps ""drink"": D R I N K? N and K absent -> avoid.

""DRILL"": D R I L L? L unknown. And L repeated? Avoids absent? D? Yes? D not absent.

So ""DRILL"": D R I L L? Tests D and L.

Letters: D, L. Only two distinct.

""DRIVE"": E at end? Absent.

""TRIPE"": T R I P E? E absent -> avoid T and P? T and P new? But E absent so fifth would be x.

Similarly, ""PRIME"": E absent? And M new? But ""prime"" ends with E? So ""prime"" has E? Avoid.

Without E: ""PRIMP""? ""primp"" ends with P? P R I M P? Pattern: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), P(5). Avoids absent? M and P. Also P repeated? Yes.

But we can test P, M.

Similarly, ""CRIMP"" but C absent.

""PRIMP"" is a word? Yes, meaning to dress or groom carefully.

So possible.

Now, choosing between:

- ""GRIMY"" : G, M, Y
- ""PRIVY"": P, V, Y
- ""PRIMP"": P, M, (P again)  -> only two new: P and M.

Since ""PRIMP"" has P repeated, it doesn't test an extra letter? Same as ""GRIMY"" for three distinct.

""GRIMY"" has G, M, Y: three distinct new letters.

Similarly ""PRIVY"" has P, V, Y.

To be most informative, I prefer ""GRIMY"" because M and Y are common.

V is less common, so ""GRIMY"" might be better.

Another option: ""WRITE"" W R I T E? E absent -> avoid.

""TRINE""? T R I N E? N and E absent.

So ""GRIMY"" seems good.

Or ""GRIOT"" is also good? G R I O T? T? Yes? Tests G, O, T.

Common.

Both are valid.

I'll go with ""GRIMY"".

Guess: grimy

<guess>grimy</guess>Based on previous feedback:

- From ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  → Secret word has R in position 2, and no C, A, N, E.  
- From ""brisk"": B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)  
  → Secret word has R in position 2 (confirmed), I in position 3, and no B, S, K.  

Combined, we know:  
- The secret word pattern is: _ R I _ _  
- Absent letters: A, B, C, E, K, N, S  
- Must use only remaining letters (e.g., D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)  

For the next guess:  
- Choose a valid 5-letter English word fitting the pattern _ R I _ _ , avoiding absent letters.  
- Prioritize words with distinct new letters to maximize information (e.g., test G, M, Y).  
- Good candidates: ""GRIMY"" (tests G in position 1, M in position 4, Y in position 5).

<guess>grimy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)
Guess 3: grimy -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:
1. Guess ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - R is in the correct position (position 2).
   - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

2. Guess ""brisk"": B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)
   - R is correct in position 2.
   - I is correct in position 3.
   - B, S, K are not in the word.

3. Guess ""grimy"": G(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) Y(x)
   - R and I are confirmed again in positions 2 and 3.
   - M is correct in position 4 (since M was in position 4 of ""grimy"").
   - G and Y are not in the word.

From all this feedback, we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R I M _ 
  (because R in position 2, I in position 3, M in position 4).
- Positions:
    - Position 1: unknown, but not any of the absent letters.
    - Position 2: R
    - Position 3: I
    - Position 4: M
    - Position 5: unknown.

- Absent letters (from all x marks): A, B, C, E, G, K, N, S, Y.
  Specifically, from ""crane"": C, A, N, E; from ""brisk"": B, S, K; from ""grimy"": G, Y → so comprehensive absent list: A, B, C, E, G, K, N, S, Y.

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form: * R I M * 
Where the first and fifth positions must be filled with letters not in the absent set. 

Remaining possible letters (excluding absent): D, F, H, J, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to guess a 5-letter word that fits: _ R I M _

And we should avoid using absent letters to maximize useful feedback.

What are possible words?

We need to test possible letters for positions 1 and 5.

Common words fitting the pattern:
- ""DRIMP""? Not a word.
- ""SCRIM""? Only 5? S and C absent -> invalid.
- ""PRIM"" is 4 letters.

Actually, ""CRIMP""? But C absent -> avoid.

Words like:
- ""TRIMS"": T R I M S? But S is absent -> avoid.
- ""BRIMY"": B absent and Y? Also B and Y absent.
- ""DRIVE"": E absent -> avoid.

Since we know M is in position 4, and we need position 5.

A common word is ""TRIM"" but that's 4 letters. 

What about 5-letter words:
- ""PRIME"": P R I M E? But E is absent -> avoid.
- ""CRIME"": C absent? Avoid.
- ""GRIME"": G absent? Avoid.

Without absent letters, possible words are limited.

""ORIUM""? Not a word.

""QUIM"" not 5 letters.

Perhaps:
- ""FRISK""? Already guessed and S,K absent.
No.

Let's think of words ending in M:
Specifically, _ R I M _

Possible:
- ""DRINK""? N absent -> avoid.
- ""BRINK""? B absent -> avoid.
- ""THRIM""? Not a word.
- ""PRIMP"": P R I M P? Pattern: P R I M P? Positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:M, 5:P? But that's repetition? And is ""primp"" a word? Yes.

""primp"": meaning to dress smartly. Yes.

Thus, ""PRIMP"": P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), P(5). But P repeated? Possible.

Also, letters: P not absent? P hasn't been tested.

But we have position 1 and 5 both possibly P? But the secret may or may not have duplicate letters.

Another possibility: ""ORIX""? Not a word.

""SHRIM""? S absent -> avoid.

""VRILL""? Not a word.

""WRIM"" not.

Another word: ""IRIDS""? Not five? ""irids"" no.

Perhaps ""PRISM""? S absent -> avoid.

With M fixed at position 4, and no E, S, etc.

""TRIMS"": S absent -> avoid.

""CRIMP"": C absent -> avoid.

Therefore, ""PRIMP"" might be one of the few valid options.

Another is ""DRIMP""? Not a word.

Or ""TRAMP""? T R A M P -> A absent -> avoid.

""TRIBE"": B and E absent.

Not them.

What about ""WHIM"" not 5 letters.

""WHIMS""? S absent and 5? W H I M S? Positions: W H I? But we need R as second? No.

Pattern must be _ R I M _

So only word I can think of is ""primp"".

Also, ""BRIMS""? B and S absent -> avoid.

""SCRIP""? S and C absent.

So ""PRIMP"" is plausible.

Another: ""CRIBS""? C absent.

Hence, I am considering ""PRIMP"".

But let's confirm: the word is ""primp"". Its structure fits: P R I M P.

Letters: P is absent? No, we have not encountered P before. It's not in the absent list.

Similarly, M is already correct at position 4? So if we guess ""PRIMP"", we have:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: R (already known)
- Position 3: I (known)
- Position 4: M (known)
- Position 5: P

We will get feedback for P at position 1 and position 5.

If P is in the word, we'll know which position is correct? Or if present.

But since we are guessing the secret, and we have three unknowns: the first letter and the fifth letter.

By guessing ""primp"", we are saying both could be P? But the secret word might not have duplicate P? We don't know.

But we need to test this.

Alternatively, is there another word?

Another possibility: ""URINE""? But U R I N E? N and E absent -> avoid.

""GRIPS""? G absent -> avoid.

Perhaps ""PRICE""? C absent.

Another: ""TRIES""? E absent -> avoid.

I think ""primp"" is a valid choice.

If we want to test different letters, perhaps try a word with different endings.

But with the constraints, it's hard.

Another word: ""CHIMP""? C absent -> avoid.

""CLAMP""? But L? Pattern not R I.

No.

""TRIP"". Not 5 letters.

So I'll go with ""primp"".

Guess: primp

But in the pattern, position 4 is M? And ""primp"" uses M for position 4? Yes.

We know M is correct at position 4, so if the secret word is ""primp"", then position 4 is M? Yes.

But we are guessing to see if it's correct.

Perhaps there is another word like ""DRUM""? Not fitting pattern.

Or ""FRUIT""? U in wrong position? F R U I T? Pattern F R U I T? Position 3 is U? But we need I at position 3? So doesn't fit.

Hence ""primp"" seems a solid guess.

So <guess>primp</guess>After analyzing the cumulative feedback:

1. **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
   - Confirms R is in position 2 of the secret word.  
   - Eliminates C, A, N, E (they are not in the word).  

2. **Guess 2: brisk → B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)**  
   - Confirms R in position 2 and I in position 3.  
   - Eliminates B, S, K (not in the word).  

3. **Guess 3: grimy → G(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) Y(x)**  
   - Confirms R in position 2, I in position 3, and M in position 4.  
   - Eliminates G and Y (not in the word).  

### Current Knowledge:  
- **Secret word pattern**: `[POS1] R I M [POS5]`.  
- **Letters present**: R (position 2), I (position 3), M (position 4).  
- **Absent letters**: A, B, C, E, G, K, N, S, Y.  
- **Possible letters for POS1 and POS5**: D, F, H, J, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.  

To solve efficiently:  
- The pattern `[POS1] R I M [POS5]` must be filled with allowed letters.  
- Avoid reusing absent letters to preserve guess quality.  
- The word ""PRIMP"" fits perfectly:  
  - P (position 1), R (position 2), I (position 3), M (position 4), P (position 5).  
  - P is untested and plausible for positions 1/5.  
  - If wrong, feedback will reveal P's status and narrow options further.

Also Y can sometimes be a vowel.\n\nWe can try to use other common consonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\nA good approach might be to use a word that includes letters we haven\'t tested yet, so we can get more information.\n\nPossible words with R in the second position?\n\nLet me think of some words: \n- b_r__ : like ""brick"", ""bring"", but we must avoid A, E, N? Actually, we know N and E are absent, so avoid them.\nBut also, we haven\'t tested B? So that might be okay.\n\nAlternatively, we can try words like ""proud"", but R is second and we have O and U.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words.\n\nWe shouldn\'t reuse the absent letters.\n\nSo, absent letters: C, A, N, E.\n\nAlso, we know that the first, third, fourth, and fifth letters are not C, A, N, E, and they don\'t contain R? Well R is in the second position, so other positions could have other letters.\n\nWe need to maximize new letter information.\n\nLet me try to think of a word with R in the second position and as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nLet me try ""proud"": \n- p, r (correct), o, u, d\nBut we don\'t know about these letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""storm"" - S, T, O, R, M. But R is in the second position? ""storm"" is s-t-o-r-m? Wait, no: s-t-o-r-m would have R in the fourth position? \n\nWe need R to be in the second position. So examples:\n- brick: b-r-i-c-k -> but c is already known absent? So we cannot use C.\n\nSimilarly, let think:\n- ""bring"": b-r-i-n-g -> but n is absent, so invalid because we know n is not in the word? The guess must be a valid word, but ""bring"" contains N and we know N is absent? But the feedback says N is absent? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had N(x) meaning N is not in the word. So if we use a word containing N, then we know one letter would be x and we already know N is absent? It\'s inefficient because we already know N is absent.\n\nSo better to avoid letters that we know are absent.\n\nSo avoid C, A, N, E.\n\nPossible words with structure: _ R _ _ _\n\nWe can try ""dirty"": d-i-r-t-y? No, R should be second. So d-r? ""dirty"" is d-i-r-t-y -> R is third? That\'s not second.\n\nWhat are some words with R in the second position?\n\nExamples:\n- bread: but contains E and A, which are absent -> not allowed? We know E and A are absent, so we cannot use them.\n\nWe must avoid letters that are known absent? No, we can use them, but they will be marked x and we gain no new information. So it\'s better to avoid them to learn about new letters.\n\nSo let\'s list words that have R as second letter and do not contain C, A, N, E.\n\nPossible letters: b, d, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, o, p, q, r? R is already in the word, but we can use R only once? Not necessarily, but since R is confirmed correct and it is only second, it might appear elsewhere? But usually Wordle allows words with duplicate letters? I think so, but we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicates.\n\nBut in this case, for guessing, we can use duplicate letters, but avoid known absent ones.\n\nBut we know R is present and in position 2, so the other R? We don\'t know.\n\nTo keep it simple, let\'s assume we avoid known absent and use new letters.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""proxy"": p-r-o-x-y -> no A,E,N,C? It has O and X, but X is less common. But we haven\'t tested O, P, X, Y.\n\nAnother: ""proud"": p-r-o-u-d -> has O, U, D, P. Avoids absent letters.\n\n""froze"": f-r-o-z-e -> but E is absent? E is last letter, but we know E is absent, so using it would be x, which we already know. So better not to use E.\n\nSimilarly, ""crowd"": c is absent and w is new? But C is absent, so we know it will be x.\n\nSo let\'s list without A,C,N,E.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""proud"": p-r-o-u-d\n- ""group"": but R is second? g-r-o-u-p -> that\'s R in second? G is first, R second, then O,U,P. But ""group"" is 5 letters? g-r-o-u-p, yes.\n\nHowever, ""group"" has O and U.\n\nAnother: ""truck"": but C and U? U is okay, but C is absent -> not good.\n\n""fruit"": f-r-u-i-t -> has U and I.\n\n""brisk"": b-r-i-s-k -> has I and S.\n\n""draft"": d-r-a-f-t -> but A is absent -> avoid.\n\nSo one good candidate is ""brisk"": b-r-i-s-k.\n\nWe haven\'t tested B, I, S, K.\n\nSimilarly, ""guild"": but R? No, ""guild"" has u,i,l,d? Not R second.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""brisk"".\n\nAnother option: ""prism"": p-r-i-s-m -> has P, I, S, M.\n\nWe can compare:\n\nI want to include common vowels: since A and E are absent, we have O, I, U.\n\nSo ""brisk"" has I, which is a vowel.\n\nAlso, ""proud"" has O and U.\n\n""fruit"" has U and I.\n\nLet me choose one that covers more vowels.\n\nSince we have R fixed at second, let\'s try to include I and O? But we can\'t cover all at once.\n\nWe can choose one that also has common consonants.\n\nCommon consonants: T, L, S, P, etc.\n\nSo ""prism"" might be good: p-r-i-s-m -> letters P, R (known), I, S, M.\n\nOr ""trope"": t-r-o-p-e -> but E is absent? Last letter E will be x, and we know it. So we lose information on one letter.\n\nSimilarly, ""trump"": t-r-u-m-p -> U and M.\n\nBut ""trump"" has T, R, U, M, P.\n\nSo let\'s decide.\n\nI think ""brisk"" is good because it has B, I, S, K, and avoids known absent letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""prick"" has C which is absent -> no.\n\n""bring"" has N absent -> avoid.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""brisk"".\n\nSo my guess is ""brisk"".\n\nLet\'s think: ""proxy"" is also good: p-r-o-x-y -> we can test O and Y, and X is less common but still.\n\nBut ""brisk"" has more common letters.\n\nPerhaps ""straw"": s-t-r-a-w -> but A is absent -> avoid.\n\nTherefore, ""brisk"" seems a good guess.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""brisk"".\n\n<guess>brisk</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is correct and in the correct position (second letter).\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must have R in the second position.\n- It should avoid using C, A, N, or E to maximize new information.\n- Focus on testing common unverified letters like B, I, S, K, O, U, etc.\n\nI chose ""brisk"" because:\n- It has R in the second position.\n- It introduces new common letters: B (first position), I (third), S (fourth), K (fifth).\n- These letters haven\'t been tested yet and are relatively frequent in English words.\n- It avoids absent letters C, A, N, E.\n\nThis guess will provide feedback on whether B, I, S, or K are in the secret word and their positions, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.\n\n<guess>brisk</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1. Guess ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)\n   - This means R is in the correct position (2nd letter), and C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.\n\n2. Guess ""brisk"": B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)\n   - R is correct and in position 2 (as before).\n   - I is correct and in position 3 (since in ""brisk"", I is the third letter).\n   - B, S, K are not in the word.\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The word is of the form: _ R I _ _\n- Additionally, the letters that are absent: A, B, C, E, K, N, S. (Since they were marked x in positions where we didn\'t have duplicates.)\n\nWe must avoid these absent letters.\n\nWe also know that R is in the second position and I is in the third.\n\nNow, we need to guess a 5-letter word with:\n- Second letter: R\n- Third letter: I\n- First, fourth, fifth letters: must not be A,B,C,E,K,N,S and also should be different.\n\nPossible letters: We have almost half the alphabet excluded. Remaining letters include: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need common ones.\n\nStructure: _ R I _ _\n\nWe need to form a word with this pattern.\n\nCommon words that fit:\n- TRICK? But has C and K -> absent? C and K are absent -> not allowed? Actually, we know C and K are absent, so they cannot be in the word. ""Trick"" contains C and K -> not valid because the secret word doesn\'t have them? No, the guess can contain these letters, but they will be marked as absent, which we already know, so inefficient. So better avoid.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid all absent letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- FRUIT: F-R-U-I-T? But we have I in third? ""fruit"" is F R U I T? So positions: F(1), R(2), U(3), I(4), T(5). But we need third letter to be I? Here it would be U in third and I in fourth? Not matching.\n\nWe require the third letter to be I.\n\nSo words with pattern: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5]\n\nList words: \n- DRIVE: D R I V E -> but E is absent -> avoid E? Guess can use E but it will be marked x since absent. But V and D are new? Still, it wastes a slot. Better not.\n\n- GRILL: G R I L L -> no absent letters? G, L are new? L appears twice. But structure: G(1), R(2), I(3), L(4), L(5). But L repeated? Okay.\n\n- CRIES? But C and E are absent -> avoid.\n\nAvoiding absent letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S.\n\nSo possible words:\n- PRIDE: P R I D E -> E is absent -> inefficient.\n- BRIDE? Has B and E -> both absent.\n\nBetter options:\n\n- GRIEF? G R I E F -> E present? But E absent -> not good.\n- THRIP? Not a word.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""PRIMO"": P R I M O -> letters: P, R, I, M, O. All new? Avoids absent? P, M, O not absent. Yes. ""primo"" is a word.\n\n- ""ORBIT""? O R B I T -> but B is absent, and also pattern: O R B I T -> I is fourth? No, we need I in third.\n\nRequires R in second and I in third.\n\nSo:\n\n- ""PRISM"": but S is absent? We know S is absent from ""brisk"" feedback. So ""prism"" has S -> avoid.\n\n- ""OPIUM"": O P I U M -> but I is third? Positions: O(1), P(2), I(3) U(4) M(5)? But second letter is P, not R? No, pattern must be R in second.\n\nWhat about ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> E absent? Avoid.\n\nPossible:\n\n- ""FRIED"": same issue.\n\nWith no absent letters:\n\n- ""CRIME"": C absent? Avoid.\n\nSince B and K are absent, words like ""brick"" are out.\n\nAnother: ""GRILL"": G R I L L? Yes, G(1), R(2), I(3), L(4), L(5). Letters: G, R, I, L. L repeated? Okay.\n\nBut ""GRILL"" has only four distinct letters? But that\'s fine.\n\n- ""TRILL"": T R I L L? Same pattern.\n\n- ""DRIFT"": D R I F T -> F and T new? But avoids absent? Yes? F and T are not known absent? Wait, A, B, C, E, K, N, S are absent, so F, D, T are okay.\n\nBut ""drift"" has D, R, I, F, T.\n\nBut fourth letter F and fifth T.\n\nOr ""GRAFT"" but A absent -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""FRISK"": F R I S K -> S and K absent? We know S and K are absent -> so letters will be marked x, inefficient.\n\nWe want to use only letters not known to be absent.\n\nSo words like:\n- GRILL: G, R, I, L\n- TRILL: T, R, I, L\n- DRILL: D, R, I, L\n- SKILL? But S and K absent -> avoid.\n\n""ORIGIN""? Too many letters? 6 letters.\n\n5-letter words:\n\n- ""DROID"": D R O I D -> I is fourth? Pattern: D(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), D(5) -> third letter O, not I? We need third to be I.\n\nHard to find with I in third.\n\n""IRISH""? But I R I S H -> I(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), H(5)? Yes, but S is absent? And also has I twice? But S is absent -> we avoid S.\n\nLetters: H is new? But S is absent.\n\nBetter not.\n\nAnother: ""PRIOR"": P R I O R -> letters P, R, I, O, R? Pattern: P(1), R(2), I(3), O(4), R(5). R repeated? Okay. Letters: P, O, I, R. Avoids absent? P, O, I, R? But R is already known. Absent letters are A,B,C,E,K,N,S. So P, O are new? Yes.\n\n""PRIOR"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""GRIMY"": G R I M Y? G(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), Y(5). No absent letters? G, M, Y are unknown.\n\n""PRIVY""?: P R I V Y? V and Y new.\n\n""PRIMO"": P R I M O? M and O.\n\nMany possibilities.\n\nNow, another important point: In ""brisk"", S(4) was marked x, meaning no S in the word? And K(5) x, no K.\n\nAlso, from ""crane"", C(1)x, A(3)x, N(4)x, E(5)x.\n\nBut we have new constraints.\n\nTo be efficient, we should choose a word that tests letters we haven\'t tried.\n\nKnown present: R and I, and I is at position 3.\n\nPossible letters for first, fourth, fifth: any letter not A,B,C,E,K,N,S.\n\nCommon among these: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z? Etc.\n\nBut we don\'t want to guess randomly; we want to reduce possibilities.\n\nAlso, since I is in third, and we have to fill others.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""PRION"": P R I O N? But N is absent -> avoid.\n- ""PRIZE"": P R I Z E? E absent -> avoid.\n- ""FRITZ"": F R I T Z? T and Z? Avoids absent? No E? So new letters.\n\nBut Z is rare.\n\nPerhaps ""GRIOT"": G R I O T? O and T? ""griot"" is a word? Yes, a historian/storyteller.\n\nSo possibilities: ""GRILL"", ""TRILL"", ""DRILL"", ""PRIOR"", ""GRIMY"", ""PRIVY"", ""GRIOT"", ""THRILL""? Too long.\n\n""THRIL""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""SHRILL""? But S and H? S absent -> avoid S.\n\nTherefore, I need to choose one.\n\nTo maximize information, we can choose a word with three new distinct letters? Since pattern _ R I _ _, and R and I known.\n\nBut in the blank, we have position 1,4,5.\n\nSo three positions to test new letters.\n\nFor example, ""PRIVY"": tests P, V, Y.\n\n""GRIMY"": tests G, M, Y.\n\n""PRIOR"": tests P, O, R (but R repeated, so we test P and O? And confirmation of R? But R position 5 is new? Secret may not have R elsewhere? Not sure.\n\nBut we know R is present in position 2, but might be elsewhere? We don\'t know.\n\nHowever, since we only have R at position 2 confirmed, and I at 3.\n\nIn ""PRIOR"", position 1: P, 4: O, 5: R. And R(5) might be present or not? But feedback will tell.\n\nBut it\'s okay.\n\nSimilarly, ""GRILL"" tests G, L, and L again? But only two distinct new.\n\nSo less information? Not ideal.\n\nTherefore, choose a word with unique new letters.\n\n""PRIVY"": P, V, Y? Uncommon? V and Y.\n\n""GRIMY"": G, M, Y? Y somewhat common.\n\n""TRUMY""? Not a word.\n\n""VIRUS""? V I R U S? Pattern not matching.\n\nMust have R second, I third.\n\n""CRIMP""? C absent.\n\n""WRING"": W R I N G? N absent -> avoid.\n\n""FLING""? Not R second.\n\nAnother possibility: ""ORBIT"": O R B I T -> B absent? And I is fourth? No.\n\nWith R and I fixed.\n\nWhat about ""URINE""? U R I N E? N and E absent -> avoid.\n\n""ARGUE""? A absent.\n\n""PROWL""? P R O W L -> O in third? But we need I in third.\n\nDifficult.\n\nI think ""GRIMY"" or ""PRIVY"" are okay.\n\nPerhaps ""PITHY""? but R not present? Must have R second.\n\nI have to use R in second.\n\nAnother word: ""CHIRP""? C absent.\n\nPerhaps ""ORRIS""? Not 5? Or ""IRIDS""? Doesn\'t fit.\n\nCommon words: ""fruit"" has I fourth, not third.\n\nPerhaps ""drink"": D R I N K? N and K absent -> avoid.\n\n""DRILL"": D R I L L? L unknown. And L repeated? Avoids absent? D? Yes? D not absent.\n\nSo ""DRILL"": D R I L L? Tests D and L.\n\nLetters: D, L. Only two distinct.\n\n""DRIVE"": E at end? Absent.\n\n""TRIPE"": T R I P E? E absent -> avoid T and P? T and P new? But E absent so fifth would be x.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRIME"": E absent? And M new? But ""prime"" ends with E? So ""prime"" has E? Avoid.\n\nWithout E: ""PRIMP""? ""primp"" ends with P? P R I M P? Pattern: P(1), R(2), I(3), M(4), P(5). Avoids absent? M and P. Also P repeated? Yes.\n\nBut we can test P, M.\n\nSimilarly, ""CRIMP"" but C absent.\n\n""PRIMP"" is a word? Yes, meaning to dress or groom carefully.\n\nSo possible.\n\nNow, choosing between:\n\n- ""GRIMY"" : G, M, Y\n- ""PRIVY"": P, V, Y\n- ""PRIMP"": P, M, (P again)  -> only two new: P and M.\n\nSince ""PRIMP"" has P repeated, it doesn\'t test an extra letter? Same as ""GRIMY"" for three distinct.\n\n""GRIMY"" has G, M, Y: three distinct new letters.\n\nSimilarly ""PRIVY"" has P, V, Y.\n\nTo be most informative, I prefer ""GRIMY"" because M and Y are common.\n\nV is less common, so ""GRIMY"" might be better.\n\nAnother option: ""WRITE"" W R I T E? E absent -> avoid.\n\n""TRINE""? T R I N E? N and E absent.\n\nSo ""GRIMY"" seems good.\n\nOr ""GRIOT"" is also good? G R I O T? T? Yes? Tests G, O, T.\n\nCommon.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI\'ll go with ""GRIMY"".\n\nGuess: grimy\n\n<guess>grimy</guess>Based on previous feedback:\n\n- From ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  \n  → Secret word has R in position 2, and no C, A, N, E.  \n- From ""brisk"": B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)  \n  → Secret word has R in position 2 (confirmed), I in position 3, and no B, S, K.  \n\nCombined, we know:  \n- The secret word pattern is: _ R I _ _  \n- Absent letters: A, B, C, E, K, N, S  \n- Must use only remaining letters (e.g., D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Choose a valid 5-letter English word fitting the pattern _ R I _ _ , avoiding absent letters.  \n- Prioritize words with distinct new letters to maximize information (e.g., test G, M, Y).  \n- Good candidates: ""GRIMY"" (tests G in position 1, M in position 4, Y in position 5).\n\n<guess>grimy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)\nGuess 3: grimy -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n1.

S and C absent.\n\nSo ""PRIMP"" is plausible.\n\nAnother: ""CRIBS""? C absent.\n\nHence, I am considering ""PRIMP"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: the word is ""primp"". Its structure fits: P R I M P.\n\nLetters: P is absent? No, we have not encountered P before. It\'s not in the absent list.\n\nSimilarly, M is already correct at position 4? So if we guess ""PRIMP"", we have:\n- Position 1: P\n- Position 2: R (already known)\n- Position 3: I (known)\n- Position 4: M (known)\n- Position 5: P\n\nWe will get feedback for P at position 1 and position 5.\n\nIf P is in the word, we\'ll know which position is correct? Or if present.\n\nBut since we are guessing the secret, and we have three unknowns: the first letter and the fifth letter.\n\nBy guessing ""primp"", we are saying both could be P? But the secret word might not have duplicate P? We don\'t know.\n\nBut we need to test this.\n\nAlternatively, is there another word?\n\nAnother possibility: ""URINE""? But U R I N E? N and E absent -> avoid.\n\n""GRIPS""? G absent -> avoid.\n\nPerhaps ""PRICE""? C absent.\n\nAnother: ""TRIES""? E absent -> avoid.\n\nI think ""primp"" is a valid choice.\n\nIf we want to test different letters, perhaps try a word with different endings.\n\nBut with the constraints, it\'s hard.\n\nAnother word: ""CHIMP""? C absent -> avoid.\n\n""CLAMP""? But L? Pattern not R I.\n\nNo.\n\n""TRIP"". Not 5 letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""primp"".\n\nGuess: primp\n\nBut in the pattern, position 4 is M? And ""primp"" uses M for position 4? Yes.\n\nWe know M is correct at position 4, so if the secret word is ""primp"", then position 4 is M? Yes.\n\nBut we are guessing to see if it\'s correct.\n\nPerhaps there is another word like ""DRUM""? Not fitting pattern.\n\nOr ""FRUIT""? U in wrong position? F R U I T? Pattern F R U I T? Position 3 is U? But we need I at position 3? So doesn\'t fit.\n\nHence ""primp"" seems a solid guess.\n\nSo <guess>primp</guess>After analyzing the cumulative feedback:\n\n1. **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  \n   - Confirms R is in position 2 of the secret word.  \n   - Eliminates C, A, N, E (they are not in the word).  \n\n2. **Guess 2: brisk → B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)**  \n   - Confirms R in position 2 and I in position 3.  \n   - Eliminates B, S, K (not in the word).  \n\n3. **Guess 3: grimy → G(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) Y(x)**  \n   - Confirms R in position 2, I in position 3, and M in position 4.  \n   - Eliminates G and Y (not in the word).  \n\n### Current Knowledge:  \n- **Secret word pattern**: `[POS1] R I M [POS5]`.  \n- **Letters present**: R (position 2), I (position 3), M (position 4).  \n- **Absent letters**: A, B, C, E, G, K, N, S, Y.  \n- **Possible letters for POS1 and POS5**: D, F, H, J, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.  \n\nTo solve efficiently:  \n- The pattern `[POS1] R I M [POS5]` must be filled with allowed letters.  \n- Avoid reusing absent letters to preserve guess quality.  \n- The word ""PRIMP"" fits perfectly:  \n  - P (position 1), R (position 2), I (position 3), M (position 4), P (position 5).  \n  - P is untested and plausible for positions 1/5.  \n  - If wrong, feedback will reveal P\'s status and narrow options further.\n\n<guess>primp</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)\nGuess 3: grimy -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) Y(x)\nGuess 4: primp -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) P(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the fourth guess ""primp"":
- P(✓) at position 1: P is correct and in the right position (1st).
- R(✓) at position 2: already known.
- I(✓) at position 3: already known.
- M(✓) at position 4: already known.
- P(-) at position 5: P is in the word but in the wrong position.

The feedback for the second P (position 5) is ""-"", meaning P is present but not in position 5.

But we already have P at position 1, so the secret word has at least two P's? Not necessarily, because the feedback for the first P is ✓, meaning it's correct at position 1. The second P is marked as ""-"", which means there is another P in the word, but not at position 5.

However, since the first P is already accounted for, the ""-"" for the second P indicates that there is a second P in the word, and it must be in a different position. But the only position left is position 5? No, the positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 has P, 2 is R, 3 is I, 4 is M, so position 5 is the only one left. But the feedback says P is not at position 5, so that means the secret word must have P at position 1 and another P at a position that is not 5? But positions 2,3,4 are fixed with R, I, M, so they can't be P. Therefore, this seems contradictory.

Let me reexamine:

The secret word pattern from previous: _ R I M _

Now we guessed ""primp"": 
- Position 1: P -> ✓, so secret has P at position 1.
- Position 2: R -> ✓, known.
- Position 3: I -> ✓, known.
- Position 4: M -> ✓, known.
- Position 5: P -> -, meaning P is in the word but not at position 5.

But if position 1 is P, and positions 2,3,4 are R,I,M (which are different from P), then the only other position is 5. But P cannot be at position 5? That would imply that P must be at position 1 and also somewhere else? But positions 2,3,4 are taken by R,I,M, so they can't be P. Therefore, the secret word must have P only at position 1, but then why is the second P marked as present but wrong position? That doesn't make sense.

Unless the secret word has duplicate letters? But in this case, if the secret word has only one P, which is at position 1, then the P at position 5 should be marked as absent (x), not present (-). But here it's marked as ""-"", meaning there is an additional P in the word that is not at position 5.

But positions 2,3,4 are fixed and not P, so the only possibility is that the secret word has two P's: one at position 1 and another at... but there is no other position? Position 5 is the only candidate, but it's marked as not there. Contradiction.

Perhaps I misinterpreted the feedback.

Feedback for ""primp"": P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) P(-)

This means:
- The first P is correct and in position 1.
- The second P is in the word but not in position 5.

But since position 1 is P, and positions 2,3,4 are R,I,M (which are not P), the second P must be at position 5? But the feedback says it's not at position 5. So that's impossible.

Unless the secret word has more than two P's? But that doesn't help.

Perhaps the secret word has P only at position 1, and the P at position 5 is not present, so it should be x, but it's marked as -, which is a mistake? But I think we have to trust the feedback.

Another possibility: the feedback symbols might be relative to the word. Since there is one P in the secret (at position 1), and we have two P's in the guess, the first one is correctly placed, so the second one is extra and should be marked as not in the word? But the feedback says ""-"" for the second P, which means it is in the word but wrong position.

In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback accounts for it. Specifically, if the secret has one P and the guess has two P's, one in the correct position and one not, then the one in the correct position gets ✓, and the extra one might be marked as absent if there isn't a second P, or as present if there is a second P.

But in this case, the feedback for the second P is ""-"", meaning there is a second P in the secret word, but not at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word must have at least two P's: one at position 1 and another at a different position. But the only other positions are 2,3,4,5. Positions 2,3,4 are R,I,M, which are fixed and not P, so the second P must be at position 5? But the feedback says it's not at position 5. Contradiction.

Unless the secret word has R, I, or M that is also P? But that can't be since they are different letters.

I think there might be a misunderstanding of the feedback format.

Let me recall the feedback format: for each letter, we have (symbol) where:
- ✓ : correct letter and position
- - : letter in word but wrong position
- x : letter not in word

In ""primp"", we have two P's. The first P is ✓, so it is correct and in position 1. The second P is -, which means that there is an additional occurrence of P in the secret word that is not at position 5.

But since position 1 is already P, and positions 2,3,4 are R,I,M, which are not P, the only possibility is that the secret word has a P at position 5? But the feedback says it's not at position 5, so that's a problem.

Perhaps the secret word has P at position 1 and also at another position, but the other position must be one of 2,3,4, which are occupied by R,I,M. But R,I,M are fixed, so they can't be P.

Unless the secret word is not what we think. But from previous feedback, we know position 2 is R, 3 is I, 4 is M, and now position 1 is P, so the secret word is P R I M ?

But then position 5 is missing, and we have P at position 5 in the guess, but the secret has no letter at position 5 yet, but it must have one.

The secret word is 5 letters, so it has a fifth letter. If the secret word is ""PRIM?"" with the fifth letter not P, then the P at position 5 in the guess should be marked as x if the fifth letter is not P and there is no other P missing. But it's marked as -, so there must be a P in the secret that is not at position 1 or 5? But position 1 is P, so the only other P could be at 2,3,4, but they are R,I,M.

I think there's a mistake in the accumulation of feedback.

Let's list all feedback again.

From guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- So R is in position 2, and C,A,N,E absent.

From guess 2: ""brisk"" -> B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)
- R in position 2 (confirmed), I in position 3, and B,S,K absent.

From guess 3: ""grimy"" -> G(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) Y(x)
- R in position 2, I in position 3, M in position 4, and G,Y absent.

So secret pattern: _ R I M _

From guess 4: ""primp"" -> P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) P(-)

This means:
- P is correct at position 1: so secret has P at position 1.
- R, I, M correct as before.
- The second P (position 5) is marked as ""-"", which means that there is a P in the secret word that is not at position 5. But since position 1 is P, this must be a second P, and it must be at a position that is not 1 and not 5. But positions 2,3,4 are R,I,M, which are not P, so it's impossible for there to be a P there.

The only logical conclusion is that the secret word has only one P, at position 1, and the P at position 5 should be marked as x, but it was marked as - by mistake. But we have to work with the feedback given.

Perhaps the feedback for the second P is ""-"" because the secret has only one P, but the guess has two, so the first one is correct, and the second one is extra, but in Wordle, it should be marked as x, not -.

But the feedback says P(-) for the fifth position, so we must accept that there is another P in the word.

Unless the secret word has a letter that can be confused, but no.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word has P at position 1, and also has a letter that is not P, but the feedback for position 5 is - for P, meaning that P is in the word but not at position 5, which requires that there is a P somewhere else.

But there is no somewhere else available.

I think there might be a misunderstanding of the feedback format for repeated letters.

In Wordle, for a guess with duplicate letters, the feedback is given based on the secret's letter counts.

For example, if the secret has one P, and the guess has two P's, with one in the correct position, then that one is marked green, and the other is marked gray (x) because there is no second P.

If the secret has two P's, and the guess has two P's, one in correct position and one not, then the correct one is green, and the other is yellow if there is a second P not yet accounted for.

In this case, for ""primp"" guess:

- If the secret has only one P (at position 1), then the feedback should be: P(✓) for position 1, and P(x) for position 5.

- If the secret has two P's, say at positions 1 and X, then position 1 is ✓, and position 5 is - if X is not 5, or ✓ if X is 5.

But here, the feedback is P(✓) and P(-), so it implies the secret has at least two P's, and one is at position 1, and the other is not at position 5.

But in the secret word, positions 2,3,4 are R,I,M, which are not P, so there is no position for the second P. Therefore, the only possibility is that the secret word has P at position 1 and at position 5, but then the feedback for position 5 should be ✓, not -.

But it's - for position 5, so it can't be at 5.

This is a paradox.

Perhaps the secret word has a letter that is not in positions 2,3,4 as we think? But from previous feedback, position 2 is R, 3 is I, 4 is M, so they are fixed.

Unless the feedback for ""grimy"" M(✓) means that M is in the word and in position 4, so it is fixed.

I think there might be an error in the feedback provided.

But since we have to proceed, let's assume the feedback is correct and see what it implies.

Feedback for ""primp"": P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) P(-)

This means:
- Position 1: P is correct.
- Position 2: R correct.
- Position 3: I correct.
- Position 4: M correct.
- Position 5: P is present but not in position 5.

Since position 1 is P, and there is another P in the word not at position 5, it must be at position 2,3, or 4. But position 2 is R, position 3 is I, position 4 is M, and they are not P, so it's impossible.

Unless one of R,I,M is P? But that can't be.

Perhaps the secret word is ""PRIMP"" but with position 5 not P, but then why is P marked as present? It doesn't make sense.

Another possibility: the feedback for position 5 is - for P, but P is not in position 5, and there is another P in the word besides position 1. But where? It must be that one of the other positions is P, but they are occupied.

I think the only way this can be is if the secret word has a letter that is not R in position 2 or something, but feedback says R(✓) for position 2, so it is R.

I'm stuck.

Perhaps the feedback for ""primp"" is for the letters, not considering position for the -.

Let's read the feedback: ""P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) P(-)""

This means that for the first P, it is correct position; for the second P, it is present but wrong position.

But in the context, the wrong position must be one of the positions that is not 1,2,3,4,5? No.

Perhaps the secret word has P at position 1 and also at a position that is not 5, but since 2,3,4 are fixed, it must be that the secret word has more than 5 letters? No.

I think there's a mistake in the initial setup.

Let's list all the feedback again carefully.

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- So position 2 is R, and C,A,N,E are absent.

Guess 2: brisk -> B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)
- Position 2 is R (known), position 3 is I, and B,S,K are absent.

Guess 3: grimy -> G(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) Y(x)
- Position 2 is R, position 3 is I, position 4 is M, and G,Y are absent.

So secret: _ R I M _

Absent letters: A,B,C,E,G,K,N,S,Y

Guess 4: primp -> P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) P(-)

For ""primp"":
- Position 1: P -> ✓, so secret position 1 is P.
- Position 2: R -> ✓, known.
- Position 3: I -> ✓, known.
- Position 4: M -> ✓, known.
- Position 5: P -> -, so P is in the secret, but not at position 5.

But since position 1 is P, this means there is a second P in the secret, and it must be at a position that is not 1 and not 5. But positions 2,3,4 are R,I,M, which are not P, so there is no such position. Contradiction.

Unless the secret word has a duplicate letter in positions 2,3, or 4, but R,I,M are different.

Perhaps the feedback for position 4 M(✓) in ""grimy"" means that M is in the word and in position 4, but it could be that the secret has another M? But in ""primp"", position 4 is M and it's ✓, so it's correct.

I think the only way is to assume that the secret word has P at position 1 and also at position 4 or something, but position 4 is M, so it can't be P.

Unless the secret word is ""PRIME"" but E is absent, and also in ""grimy"" M is at position 4, so ""PRIME"" would have M at position 4, but E is absent.

But in ""primp"", if secret is ""PRIME"", then for guess ""primp"": position 1 P is correct, position 2 R correct, position 3 I correct, position 4 M correct, position 5 P vs E: E is not P, and since there is only one P in ""PRIME"" (at position 1), the P at position 5 should be x, not -.

But in the feedback, it's - for P, which would be wrong for ""PRIME"".

For ""PRIMP"" as secret: if secret is ""PRIMP"", then position 5 is P, so it should be ✓, not -.

But feedback is - for position 5.

So secret is not ""PRIMP"".

Perhaps the secret has P at position 1 and position 3 or something, but position 3 is I, from feedback.

I think there's an error in the feedback or in my reasoning.

Another possibility: the feedback for ""primp"" P(-) for position 5 means that P is in the word but not at position 5, and since position 1 is P, it's the same P, but that doesn't make sense because the first P is already counted.

In Wordle, each instance is treated separately.

For example, if secret is ""APPLE"" and guess is ""PAPER"", then the first P is - (because P is in secret but not at position 1, position 2 is P in secret), and the second P is x if there is no third P, or - if there is.

In this case, for secret ""PRIM?"" with only one P at position 1, guess ""primp"" has P at 1 and P at 5. Position 1 P is correct, so green. Position 5 P: since there is no other P in secret, it should be gray (x).

But the feedback says it's yellow (-), which means there is another P in the secret that is not at position 5.

But there isn't, so contradiction.

Unless the secret has two P's.

But where can the second P be? Only at position 5, but then it should be green, not yellow.

So if secret has P at 1 and P at 5, then both should be green for ""primp"", but position 5 is yellow, which is wrong.

If secret has P at 1 and say at position 4, but position 4 is M, so it can't be.

I think the only logical conclusion is that the feedback for position 5 should be x, but it's given as -, so perhaps it's a mistake.

Perhaps the secret word has a letter that is not in the positions we think, but the feedback has been consistent for positions 2,3,4.

For example, from ""brisk"" I(✓) at position 3, so position 3 is I.

From ""grimy"" M(✓) at position 4, so position 4 is M.

So it's fixed.

I think we have to accept that there is a second P in the secret, and it must be that one of the positions 2,3,4 is not fixed, but they are.

Unless the feedback for ""grimy"" M(✓) means that M is in the word and in position 4, but it could be that there is another M or something, but for position 4, it's correct.

I'm out of ideas.

Perhaps the secret word is ""PRIM P"" with a space, but no.

Another thought: the feedback for ""primp"" P(-) for position 5 might be a typo, and it should be x.

But since we have to work with it, let's assume that the secret has a second P, and it must be that position 2,3, or 4 is not what we think, but the feedback says they are R,I,M.

Perhaps the R, I, M are not necessarily the only letters; there could be duplicates.

For example, if the secret word has two I's or something, but in ""brisk"" I(✓) at position 3, and in ""grimy"" I(✓) at position 3, so position 3 is I.

Similarly for R and M.

Unless the secret has, say, position 3 is I, but also position 1 is I or something, but position 1 is P now.

I think we need to ignore the contradiction and make a guess for the fifth position.

The secret word is P R I M ? 

From feedback, the fifth letter is not P, and not any absent letter.

Absent letters: A,B,C,E,G,K,N,S,Y

So possible letters for position 5: D,F,H,J,L,O,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z

Also, from ""primp"" P(-) for position 5, it means that P is in the word but not at position 5, which we already have at position 1, so it doesn't give new information about position 5.

So position 5 is one of the above letters.

We need to guess a word that is P R I M ? with the fifth letter from the allowed set.

But we have only one guess left? We have 6 tries, we used 4, so two left.

But we can guess any word to test.

Since we know P R I M are fixed, we can guess a word like ""PRIME"" but E is absent, so not.

Or ""PRINT"" but N absent.

So possible words: ""PRIMP"" we already guessed, but it's not correct.

""PRIM"" with a letter: like ""PRIMO"" but O is possible.

""PRIMO"": P R I M O

But position 5 O.

Or ""PRIMI"" not a word.

""PRIMS"" S absent.

So ""PRIMO"" is a word.

Or ""PRIMY"" Y absent.

Or ""PRIMM"" not a word.

So ""PRIMO"" or ""PRIMU"" not.

Or ""PRIMD"" not.

So ""PRIMO"" is a possibility.

Another: ""FRIM"" not 5 letters.

So I think ""PRIMO"" is a good guess.

Or ""TRIM"" not 5.

So let's guess ""PRIMO"".

Then we can see the feedback.

But we have the feedback for ""primp"" saying P at position 5 is present but wrong position, which is confusing, but for ""PRIMO"", position 5 is O, not P.

So let's do that.

<guess>primo</guess>

But we have to make a guess.

Perhaps ""PRIM"" with D: ""PRIMD"" not a word.

Or ""PRIM"" with T: ""PRIMT"" not.

So ""PRIMO"" is valid.

Or ""PRIMY"" but Y absent.

So I'll go with ""PRIMO"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - R is in position 2 of the secret word.  
     - C, A, N, E are absent.  
   - **Guess 2: brisk** → B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)  
     - R (position 2) and I (position 3) are confirmed.  
     - B, S, K are absent.  
   - **Guess 3: grimy** → G(x), R(✓), I(✓), M(✓), Y(x)  
     - R (position 2), I (position 3), and M (position 4) are confirmed.  
     - G, Y are absent.  
   - **Guess 4: primp** → P(✓), R(✓), I(✓), M(✓), P(-)  
     - P is confirmed in position 1.  
     - R (position 2), I (position 3), and M (position 4) are reconfirmed.  
     - The second P (position 5) is marked as present but not in position 5, indicating a second P exists in the secret word at a different position (not 1, 2, 3, or 4, as these are fixed). This implies the secret word has at least two P's, with one at position 1 and another elsewhere. However, positions 2, 3, and 4 are occupied by R, I, and M (which are not P), so the second P must be at position 5. But the feedback explicitly states it is not at position 5, creating a contradiction. Given the feedback, we proceed by focusing on the known pattern and absent letters.

2. **Current Knowledge**:
   - **Secret word pattern**: P R I M ? (positions 1-4 confirmed, position 5 unknown).
   - **Confirmed letters**: P (position 1), R (position 2), I (position 3), M (position 4).
   - **Absent letters**: A, B, C, E, G, K, N, S, Y (from all feedback).
   - **Possible letters for position 5**: D, F, H, J, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (not absent). However, the feedback for ""primp"" (P(-) at position 5) suggests P is present but not at position 5, so position 5 cannot be P. Thus, possible letters are D, F, H, J, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.
   - **Contradiction note**: The feedback for ""primp"" indicates a second P exists but not at position 5, yet positions 1-4 are fixed and not P. This is unresolved, so we prioritize the pattern and absent letters for the next guess.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - The secret word is ""PRIM"" + a fifth letter from the allowed set.
   - We need a valid 5-letter word that fits ""PRIM?"" with the fifth letter not absent and not P.
   - Common words include ""PRIMO"" (meaning ""first"" or ""top-quality""), which uses O (a common vowel not tested).
   - ""PRIMO"" tests O at position 5, which is a plausible option and avoids absent letters.
   - If ""PRIMO"" is incorrect, feedback on O will help narrow down position 5 further.

4. **Selection of Guess**:
   - **PRIMO**: P (position 1, known), R (position 2, known), I (position 3, known), M (position 4, known), O (position 5, untested).
   - O is a reasonable guess as it is a common vowel and hasn't been tested yet.
   - Alternatives like ""PRIMD"" or ""PRIMT"" are not valid words, making ""PRIMO"" a strong choice.

<guess>primo</guess>",primo,"We have the feedback from the fourth guess ""primp"":
- P(✓) at position 1: P is correct and in the right position (1st).
- R(✓) at position 2: already known.
- I(✓) at position 3: already known.
- M(✓) at position 4: already known.
- P(-) at position 5: P is in the word but in the wrong position.

The feedback for the second P (position 5) is ""-"", meaning P is present but not in position 5.

But we already have P at position 1, so the secret word has at least two P's? Not necessarily, because the feedback for the first P is ✓, meaning it's correct at position 1. The second P is marked as ""-"", which means there is another P in the word, but not at position 5.

However, since the first P is already accounted for, the ""-"" for the second P indicates that there is a second P in the word, and it must be in a different position. But the only position left is position 5? No, the positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 has P, 2 is R, 3 is I, 4 is M, so position 5 is the only one left. But the feedback says P is not at position 5, so that means the secret word must have P at position 1 and another P at a position that is not 5? But positions 2,3,4 are fixed with R, I, M, so they can't be P. Therefore, this seems contradictory.

Let me reexamine:

The secret word pattern from previous: _ R I M _

Now we guessed ""primp"": 
- Position 1: P -> ✓, so secret has P at position 1.
- Position 2: R -> ✓, known.
- Position 3: I -> ✓, known.
- Position 4: M -> ✓, known.
- Position 5: P -> -, meaning P is in the word but not at position 5.

But if position 1 is P, and positions 2,3,4 are R,I,M (which are different from P), then the only other position is 5. But P cannot be at position 5? That would imply that P must be at position 1 and also somewhere else? But positions 2,3,4 are taken by R,I,M, so they can't be P. Therefore, the secret word must have P only at position 1, but then why is the second P marked as present but wrong position? That doesn't make sense.

Unless the secret word has duplicate letters? But in this case, if the secret word has only one P, which is at position 1, then the P at position 5 should be marked as absent (x), not present (-). But here it's marked as ""-"", meaning there is an additional P in the word that is not at position 5.

But positions 2,3,4 are fixed and not P, so the only possibility is that the secret word has two P's: one at position 1 and another at... but there is no other position? Position 5 is the only candidate, but it's marked as not there. Contradiction.

Perhaps I misinterpreted the feedback.

Feedback for ""primp"": P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) P(-)

This means:
- The first P is correct and in position 1.
- The second P is in the word but not in position 5.

But since position 1 is P, and positions 2,3,4 are R,I,M (which are not P), the second P must be at position 5? But the feedback says it's not at position 5. So that's impossible.

Unless the secret word has more than two P's? But that doesn't help.

Perhaps the secret word has P only at position 1, and the P at position 5 is not present, so it should be x, but it's marked as -, which is a mistake? But I think we have to trust the feedback.

Another possibility: the feedback symbols might be relative to the word. Since there is one P in the secret (at position 1), and we have two P's in the guess, the first one is correctly placed, so the second one is extra and should be marked as not in the word? But the feedback says ""-"" for the second P, which means it is in the word but wrong position.

In Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback accounts for it. Specifically, if the secret has one P and the guess has two P's, one in the correct position and one not, then the one in the correct position gets ✓, and the extra one might be marked as absent if there isn't a second P, or as present if there is a second P.

But in this case, the feedback for the second P is ""-"", meaning there is a second P in the secret word, but not at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word must have at least two P's: one at position 1 and another at a different position. But the only other positions are 2,3,4,5. Positions 2,3,4 are R,I,M, which are fixed and not P, so the second P must be at position 5? But the feedback says it's not at position 5. Contradiction.

Unless the secret word has R, I, or M that is also P? But that can't be since they are different letters.

I think there might be a misunderstanding of the feedback format.

Let me recall the feedback format: for each letter, we have (symbol) where:
- ✓ : correct letter and position
- - : letter in word but wrong position
- x : letter not in word

In ""primp"", we have two P's. The first P is ✓, so it is correct and in position 1. The second P is -, which means that there is an additional occurrence of P in the secret word that is not at position 5.

But since position 1 is already P, and positions 2,3,4 are R,I,M, which are not P, the only possibility is that the secret word has a P at position 5? But the feedback says it's not at position 5, so that's a problem.

Perhaps the secret word has P at position 1 and also at another position, but the other position must be one of 2,3,4, which are occupied by R,I,M. But R,I,M are fixed, so they can't be P.

Unless the secret word is not what we think. But from previous feedback, we know position 2 is R, 3 is I, 4 is M, and now position 1 is P, so the secret word is P R I M ?

But then position 5 is missing, and we have P at position 5 in the guess, but the secret has no letter at position 5 yet, but it must have one.

The secret word is 5 letters, so it has a fifth letter. If the secret word is ""PRIM?"" with the fifth letter not P, then the P at position 5 in the guess should be marked as x if the fifth letter is not P and there is no other P missing. But it's marked as -, so there must be a P in the secret that is not at position 1 or 5? But position 1 is P, so the only other P could be at 2,3,4, but they are R,I,M.

I think there's a mistake in the accumulation of feedback.

Let's list all feedback again.

From guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- So R is in position 2, and C,A,N,E absent.

From guess 2: ""brisk"" -> B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)
- R in position 2 (confirmed), I in position 3, and B,S,K absent.

From guess 3: ""grimy"" -> G(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) Y(x)
- R in position 2, I in position 3, M in position 4, and G,Y absent.

So secret pattern: _ R I M _

From guess 4: ""primp"" -> P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) P(-)

This means:
- P is correct at position 1: so secret has P at position 1.
- R, I, M correct as before.
- The second P (position 5) is marked as ""-"", which means that there is a P in the secret word that is not at position 5. But since position 1 is P, this must be a second P, and it must be at a position that is not 1 and not 5. But positions 2,3,4 are R,I,M, which are not P, so it's impossible for there to be a P there.

The only logical conclusion is that the secret word has only one P, at position 1, and the P at position 5 should be marked as x, but it was marked as - by mistake. But we have to work with the feedback given.

Perhaps the feedback for the second P is ""-"" because the secret has only one P, but the guess has two, so the first one is correct, and the second one is extra, but in Wordle, it should be marked as x, not -.

But the feedback says P(-) for the fifth position, so we must accept that there is another P in the word.

Unless the secret word has a letter that can be confused, but no.

Another idea: perhaps the secret word has P at position 1, and also has a letter that is not P, but the feedback for position 5 is - for P, meaning that P is in the word but not at position 5, which requires that there is a P somewhere else.

But there is no somewhere else available.

I think there might be a misunderstanding of the feedback format for repeated letters.

In Wordle, for a guess with duplicate letters, the feedback is given based on the secret's letter counts.

For example, if the secret has one P, and the guess has two P's, with one in the correct position, then that one is marked green, and the other is marked gray (x) because there is no second P.

If the secret has two P's, and the guess has two P's, one in correct position and one not, then the correct one is green, and the other is yellow if there is a second P not yet accounted for.

In this case, for ""primp"" guess:

- If the secret has only one P (at position 1), then the feedback should be: P(✓) for position 1, and P(x) for position 5.

- If the secret has two P's, say at positions 1 and X, then position 1 is ✓, and position 5 is - if X is not 5, or ✓ if X is 5.

But here, the feedback is P(✓) and P(-), so it implies the secret has at least two P's, and one is at position 1, and the other is not at position 5.

But in the secret word, positions 2,3,4 are R,I,M, which are not P, so there is no position for the second P. Therefore, the only possibility is that the secret word has P at position 1 and at position 5, but then the feedback for position 5 should be ✓, not -.

But it's - for position 5, so it can't be at 5.

This is a paradox.

Perhaps the secret word has a letter that is not in positions 2,3,4 as we think? But from previous feedback, position 2 is R, 3 is I, 4 is M, so they are fixed.

Unless the feedback for ""grimy"" M(✓) means that M is in the word and in position 4, so it is fixed.

I think there might be an error in the feedback provided.

But since we have to proceed, let's assume the feedback is correct and see what it implies.

Feedback for ""primp"": P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) P(-)

This means:
- Position 1: P is correct.
- Position 2: R correct.
- Position 3: I correct.
- Position 4: M correct.
- Position 5: P is present but not in position 5.

Since position 1 is P, and there is another P in the word not at position 5, it must be at position 2,3, or 4. But position 2 is R, position 3 is I, position 4 is M, and they are not P, so it's impossible.

Unless one of R,I,M is P? But that can't be.

Perhaps the secret word is ""PRIMP"" but with position 5 not P, but then why is P marked as present? It doesn't make sense.

Another possibility: the feedback for position 5 is - for P, but P is not in position 5, and there is another P in the word besides position 1. But where? It must be that one of the other positions is P, but they are occupied.

I think the only way this can be is if the secret word has a letter that is not R in position 2 or something, but feedback says R(✓) for position 2, so it is R.

I'm stuck.

Perhaps the feedback for ""primp"" is for the letters, not considering position for the -.

Let's read the feedback: ""P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) P(-)""

This means that for the first P, it is correct position; for the second P, it is present but wrong position.

But in the context, the wrong position must be one of the positions that is not 1,2,3,4,5? No.

Perhaps the secret word has P at position 1 and also at a position that is not 5, but since 2,3,4 are fixed, it must be that the secret word has more than 5 letters? No.

I think there's a mistake in the initial setup.

Let's list all the feedback again carefully.

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- So position 2 is R, and C,A,N,E are absent.

Guess 2: brisk -> B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)
- Position 2 is R (known), position 3 is I, and B,S,K are absent.

Guess 3: grimy -> G(x) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) Y(x)
- Position 2 is R, position 3 is I, position 4 is M, and G,Y are absent.

So secret: _ R I M _

Absent letters: A,B,C,E,G,K,N,S,Y

Guess 4: primp -> P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) P(-)

For ""primp"":
- Position 1: P -> ✓, so secret position 1 is P.
- Position 2: R -> ✓, known.
- Position 3: I -> ✓, known.
- Position 4: M -> ✓, known.
- Position 5: P -> -, so P is in the secret, but not at position 5.

But since position 1 is P, this means there is a second P in the secret, and it must be at a position that is not 1 and not 5. But positions 2,3,4 are R,I,M, which are not P, so there is no such position. Contradiction.

Unless the secret word has a duplicate letter in positions 2,3, or 4, but R,I,M are different.

Perhaps the feedback for position 4 M(✓) in ""grimy"" means that M is in the word and in position 4, but it could be that the secret has another M? But in ""primp"", position 4 is M and it's ✓, so it's correct.

I think the only way is to assume that the secret word has P at position 1 and also at position 4 or something, but position 4 is M, so it can't be P.

Unless the secret word is ""PRIME"" but E is absent, and also in ""grimy"" M is at position 4, so ""PRIME"" would have M at position 4, but E is absent.

But in ""primp"", if secret is ""PRIME"", then for guess ""primp"": position 1 P is correct, position 2 R correct, position 3 I correct, position 4 M correct, position 5 P vs E: E is not P, and since there is only one P in ""PRIME"" (at position 1), the P at position 5 should be x, not -.

But in the feedback, it's - for P, which would be wrong for ""PRIME"".

For ""PRIMP"" as secret: if secret is ""PRIMP"", then position 5 is P, so it should be ✓, not -.

But feedback is - for position 5.

So secret is not ""PRIMP"".

Perhaps the secret has P at position 1 and position 3 or something, but position 3 is I, from feedback.

I think there's an error in the feedback or in my reasoning.

Another possibility: the feedback for ""primp"" P(-) for position 5 means that P is in the word but not at position 5, and since position 1 is P, it's the same P, but that doesn't make sense because the first P is already counted.

In Wordle, each instance is treated separately.

For example, if secret is ""APPLE"" and guess is ""PAPER"", then the first P is - (because P is in secret but not at position 1, position 2 is P in secret), and the second P is x if there is no third P, or - if there is.

In this case, for secret ""PRIM?"" with only one P at position 1, guess ""primp"" has P at 1 and P at 5. Position 1 P is correct, so green. Position 5 P: since there is no other P in secret, it should be gray (x).

But the feedback says it's yellow (-), which means there is another P in the secret that is not at position 5.

But there isn't, so contradiction.

Unless the secret has two P's.

But where can the second P be? Only at position 5, but then it should be green, not yellow.

So if secret has P at 1 and P at 5, then both should be green for ""primp"", but position 5 is yellow, which is wrong.

If secret has P at 1 and say at position 4, but position 4 is M, so it can't be.

I think the only logical conclusion is that the feedback for position 5 should be x, but it's given as -, so perhaps it's a mistake.

Perhaps the secret word has a letter that is not in the positions we think, but the feedback has been consistent for positions 2,3,4.

For example, from ""brisk"" I(✓) at position 3, so position 3 is I.

From ""grimy"" M(✓) at position 4, so position 4 is M.

So it's fixed.

I think we have to accept that there is a second P in the secret, and it must be that one of the positions 2,3,4 is not fixed, but they are.

Unless the feedback for ""grimy"" M(✓) means that M is in the word and in position 4, but it could be that there is another M or something, but for position 4, it's correct.

I'm out of ideas.

Perhaps the secret word is ""PRIM P"" with a space, but no.

Another thought: the feedback for ""primp"" P(-) for position 5 might be a typo, and it should be x.

But since we have to work with it, let's assume that the secret has a second P, and it must be that position 2,3, or 4 is not what we think, but the feedback says they are R,I,M.

Perhaps the R, I, M are not necessarily the only letters; there could be duplicates.

For example, if the secret word has two I's or something, but in ""brisk"" I(✓) at position 3, and in ""grimy"" I(✓) at position 3, so position 3 is I.

Similarly for R and M.

Unless the secret has, say, position 3 is I, but also position 1 is I or something, but position 1 is P now.

I think we need to ignore the contradiction and make a guess for the fifth position.

The secret word is P R I M ? 

From feedback, the fifth letter is not P, and not any absent letter.

Absent letters: A,B,C,E,G,K,N,S,Y

So possible letters for position 5: D,F,H,J,L,O,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z

Also, from ""primp"" P(-) for position 5, it means that P is in the word but not at position 5, which we already have at position 1, so it doesn't give new information about position 5.

So position 5 is one of the above letters.

We need to guess a word that is P R I M ? with the fifth letter from the allowed set.

But we have only one guess left? We have 6 tries, we used 4, so two left.

But we can guess any word to test.

Since we know P R I M are fixed, we can guess a word like ""PRIME"" but E is absent, so not.

Or ""PRINT"" but N absent.

So possible words: ""PRIMP"" we already guessed, but it's not correct.

""PRIM"" with a letter: like ""PRIMO"" but O is possible.

""PRIMO"": P R I M O

But position 5 O.

Or ""PRIMI"" not a word.

""PRIMS"" S absent.

So ""PRIMO"" is a word.

Or ""PRIMY"" Y absent.

Or ""PRIMM"" not a word.

So ""PRIMO"" or ""PRIMU"" not.

Or ""PRIMD"" not.

So ""PRIMO"" is a possibility.

Another: ""FRIM"" not 5 letters.

So I think ""PRIMO"" is a good guess.

Or ""TRIM"" not 5.

So let's guess ""PRIMO"".

Then we can see the feedback.

But we have the feedback for ""primp"" saying P at position 5 is present but wrong position, which is confusing, but for ""PRIMO"", position 5 is O, not P.

So let's do that.

<guess>primo</guess>

But we have to make a guess.

Perhaps ""PRIM"" with D: ""PRIMD"" not a word.

Or ""PRIM"" with T: ""PRIMT"" not.

So ""PRIMO"" is valid.

Or ""PRIMY"" but Y absent.

So I'll go with ""PRIMO"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - R is in position 2 of the secret word.  
     - C, A, N, E are absent.  
   - **Guess 2: brisk** → B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)  
     - R (position 2) and I (position 3) are confirmed.  
     - B, S, K are absent.  
   - **Guess 3: grimy** → G(x), R(✓), I(✓), M(✓), Y(x)  
     - R (position 2), I (position 3), and M (position 4) are confirmed.  
     - G, Y are absent.  
   - **Guess 4: primp** → P(✓), R(✓), I(✓), M(✓), P(-)  
     - P is confirmed in position 1.  
     - R (position 2), I (position 3), and M (position 4) are reconfirmed.  
     - The second P (position 5) is marked as present but not in position 5, indicating a second P exists in the secret word at a different position (not 1, 2, 3, or 4, as these are fixed). This implies the secret word has at least two P's, with one at position 1 and another elsewhere. However, positions 2, 3, and 4 are occupied by R, I, and M (which are not P), so the second P must be at position 5. But the feedback explicitly states it is not at position 5, creating a contradiction. Given the feedback, we proceed by focusing on the known pattern and absent letters.

2. **Current Knowledge**:
   - **Secret word pattern**: P R I M ? (positions 1-4 confirmed, position 5 unknown).
   - **Confirmed letters**: P (position 1), R (position 2), I (position 3), M (position 4).
   - **Absent letters**: A, B, C, E, G, K, N, S, Y (from all feedback).
   - **Possible letters for position 5**: D, F, H, J, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (not absent). However, the feedback for ""primp"" (P(-) at position 5) suggests P is present but not at position 5, so position 5 cannot be P. Thus, possible letters are D, F, H, J, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.
   - **Contradiction note**: The feedback for ""primp"" indicates a second P exists but not at position 5, yet positions 1-4 are fixed and not P. This is unresolved, so we prioritize the pattern and absent letters for the next guess.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - The secret word is ""PRIM"" + a fifth letter from the allowed set.
   - We need a valid 5-letter word that fits ""PRIM?"" with the fifth letter not absent and not P.
   - Common words include ""PRIMO"" (meaning ""first"" or ""top-quality""), which uses O (a common vowel not tested).
   - ""PRIMO"" tests O at position 5, which is a plausible option and avoids absent letters.
   - If ""PRIMO"" is incorrect, feedback on O will help narrow down position 5 further.

4. **Selection of Guess**:
   - **PRIMO**: P (position 1, known), R (position 2, known), I (position 3, known), M (position 4, known), O (position 5, untested).
   - O is a reasonable guess as it is a common vowel and hasn't been tested yet.
   - Alternatives like ""PRIMD"" or ""PRIMT"" are not valid words, making ""PRIMO"" a strong choice.",Guess 5: primo -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
