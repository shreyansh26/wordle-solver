We are starting the game. We need to make our first guess. Since we have no prior feedback, we should choose a word that can give us maximum information. Typically, words with common letters and minimal repeating letters are chosen.

I recall that in Wordle, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"" are often recommended as starting words because they contain a mix of common consonants and vowels.

One crucial point: The game expects a valid English word. We cannot use non-English words.

I will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and a combination of vowels and consonants.

Let me pick ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It has C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is also a very good starting word because it has two vowels and three consonants, including R, S which are common.

But I remember that ""SLATE"" is often used. 

However, I don't think the exact word matters too much as long as it's balanced. Let me go with ""RAISE"" because it covers A, I (vowels) and R, S, E (which is both vowel and consonant, but E is common).

Another popular one is ""ADIEU"" which has many vowels, but it might not be the best because we get fewer consonants? 

Let me decide: I will use ""CRANE"".

So, my first guess is: CRANE

But note: the example in the instructions used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". So I should avoid using any of these? Actually, we can use any word.

I'll go with ""CRANE"".

After making the guess, we'll get feedback and then we can use that to make the next guess.

But for now, we are only making the first guess.

So, let's output: <guess>CRANE</guess>

Wait, but the format should be exactly: <guess> guessed-word </guess>

To start the game, I need to make an initial 5-letter word guess with no prior feedback. My goal is to maximize information by choosing a word with common letters and a mix of vowels/consonants. A strong opening word should:
- Cover frequent letters (e.g., E, A, R, S, T).
- Avoid repeated letters.
- Include vowels to help narrow down possibilities.

I selected **""CRANE""** because:
- It uses five distinct letters.
- Contains three vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N)—note that E is a vowel here.
- Features high-frequency letters (E, R, A), which appear in many English words.
- This word will provide feedback on common characters, helping eliminate large groups for subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for our first guess:
- C: '-' meaning C is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 1)
- R: 'x' meaning R is not in the secret word at all
- A: 'x' meaning A is not in the secret word
- N: '-' meaning N is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in CRANE)
- E: 'x' meaning E is not in the secret word

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters C and N, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- The secret word does NOT contain R, A, or E.

Also, since C and N are present, but not in their guessed positions, we can deduce:
- C must appear in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not position 1).
- N must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not position 4).

Moreover, we know the secret word has no R, A, E.

Now, for our second guess:
- We must include C and N (since they are in the word).
- We should exclude R, A, E.
- We need to try to put C and N in positions where they might be correct, and also include new letters to test.

Constraints on positions for C and N:
- C cannot be in position 1 again. Possible positions: 2,3,4,5.
- N cannot be in position 4 again. Possible positions:1,2,3,5.

We also want to test other common letters (since R,A,E are out) that might be in the word. Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

Let's think of a word that:
- Contains C and N.
- Does not contain R,A,E.
- Places C in one of positions 2,3,4,5 and N in a position not 4 (i.e., 1,2,3,5).

To maximize information, we can try to put C and N in positions they haven't been tried yet, and also test new positions.

In our first guess:
- C was in position 1
- N was in position 4

So for C: we can try position 2,3,4 or5. Similarly, N: try position 1,2,3,5.

Now, can we put both in positions that are different? Also, we have 3 other letters to choose.

Let me list some possible words.

Since C cannot be in position1, and we know position1 is not C, and not R,A,E. But we don't know position1. It must be a letter that isn't C (but C is elsewhere), and not R,A,E.

Also, position1 cannot be the same as the letters excluded? All positions must not be R,A,E since they are not in the word.

Similarly, position3 is not A? But A is not in the word, so position3 cannot be A. Actually, no R,A,E anywhere.

Now, we have to choose a word without R,A,E, with C and N, and not place C at position1 or N at position4.

Let me try to think of words that start with different letters, since position1 is unknown.

We can try picking a word with S or T, which are common.

For example, let's try putting C at position 3 and N at position 2? Then the word would be ? N C ? ?

Possible words: 

- Must include N and C.

What if we try something like ""SONIC""? But S is new, O is vowel (but we don't know about O yet), N at position4? But we know N is not in position4 (from feedback: N was in position4 and got '-', meaning it is not correct there). So we cannot put N in position4 again? Actually, we can, but the feedback said N is in the word but not at position4, so if we put it again at position4, it would get '-' again. But it's inefficient. We should put N in a new position to test.

Similarly for C.

So we should avoid position4 for N and position1 for C.

Therefore, ""SONIC"" has N at position4? No: S(1) O(2) N(3) I(4) C(5)? Wait, let me index: 
Position: 1-S, 2-O, 3-N, 4-I, 5-C.

But N is at position3 (not position4), and C is at position5 (not position1). So that works? And it avoids R,A,E.

But let me check the letters: S,O,N,I,C. We don't have R,A,E, so okay.

Is ""SONIC"" valid? Yes, it's a word.

But we also know from feedback that C is in the word but not position1 (which we knew), but in SONIC, C is at position5, so if the secret word has C at position5, it would get '✓'. If not, 'x' or '-'.

Similarly, N is at position3.

But we want to test new positions.

Another option: words beginning with C? But C cannot be position1? Wait, feedback said C is not in position1, and since it's present but not position1, we shouldn't put it at position1 again. So position1 can be something else.

We can put position1 as a new letter, say S or T.

What about ""SNICK""? S,N,I,C,K. But K is new.

""SNICK"" has S at1, N at2, I at3, C at4, K at5. But N is at position2 (not 4), C at position4 (not 1). So positions: avoid position4 for N? Position4 here is C, not N. N is at2.

N is at2 (which is new position compared to previous) and C at4 (which was position1 before? No, C was at1 now at position4).

But ""SNICK"" might be uncommon? Let's see if it's a word.

SNICK: as in snick or snee? It might be acceptable.

But let's think of a word with C and N and common vowels. Vowels: We know no A, E. So vowels left: I,O,U,Y.

We can use O,I,U,Y as vowels.

For example, ""CLINT"": C,L,I,N,T? Positions:1-C,2-L,3-I,4-N,5-T. But C cannot be at position1? Because we have feedback that C is in the word but not position1. So if we put C at1, it would be incorrect. And since we know it's not position1, if we put it there, we lose information? Actually, the feedback would still say '-' if it's in the word but wrong position, but we know position1 is wrong for C, so it's wasteful to put it there again.

Similarly, ""CLINT"" has C at position1? So we'd get '-' for C? And N at position4? But N was previously at position4 and got '-', meaning not position4. Now we're putting N at position4 again? Then it will also give '-'? And we don't test a new position for N.

So we should avoid putting C at position1 and N at position4.

Therefore, ""CLINT"" is not good.

Another word: ""CONIC"": has O and I. Positions:1-C,2-O,3-N,4-I,5-C. Oh wait, two C's? But secret word might have double? Feedback didn't show double, but allowed? Wordle allows doubles? The rules didn't say not to.

But in feedback, each letter is considered? And ""CONIC"" has C at position1 and position5? But we know C is in the word but not position1, so putting at position1 might confuse? And at position5.

But let's see if the secret word has double letters? We don't know.

But for efficiency, we should avoid repeating letters if possible, since we don't know.

Also, C in position1 is not good because we already know position1 is not C.

So better to choose a word with C elsewhere.

Alternative: ""PINCH"" P,I,N,C,H? Positions:1-P,2-I,3-N,4-C,5-H? Then N at position3 (not 4), C at position4 (not 1). So avoid position4 for N? Yes, position3 is new for N.

But also, we have new letters P,I,N,C,H. But N and C are known, P,I,H new.

Also, no vowels? I is vowel? Yes.

But we don't know about I.

Now, let's consider how to cover more common letters.

Since R is out, and E,A out, we have: S, T, L, I, O, U, M, P, D, etc.

Let me think of a word: Maybe ""SCION""?: S,C,I,O,N. Positions:1-S,2-C,3-I,4-O,5-N. Then C at position2 (not position1, good), N at position5 (not position4, good). And letters are all distinct: S,C,I,O,N.

And no R,A,E.

Also, S and T are very common, but T is not included? In this case, we test S, C, I, O, N.

C and N are already known to be present. So we are retesting them? But in different positions, which is good to find the correct spots.

Moreover, we test O and I? Which may or may not be present.

This seems decent.

Another possibility: ""MUNCH""? M,U,N,C,H? Has U and no I or O. But similarly.

""SCION"" seems fine.

""SONIC"": as I thought earlier: S(1) O(2) N(3) I(4) C(5). C at5 and N at3? Both new positions.

In SONIC: position1=S, position2=O, position3=N, position4=I, position5=C.

Compared to SCION? SCION: S,C,I,O,N -> positions:1-S,2-C,3-I,4-O,5-N.

Which is better?

In SONIC, N is at position3 and C at position5.

We don't know which is better.

Both avoid known bad positions.

But in SCION, C is tried at position2 which is a new position and might be correct? Or not.

Similarly for SONIC: C at5 or N at3.

Either is okay.

But let me see the frequency: position2 and position5 might be more common for certain letters? Not sure.

Another word: ""STOIC"": S,T,O,I,C? Positions:1-S,2-T,3-O,4-I,5-C. Then only C at position5? And N is missing? Oh N! We know N must be in the word, so our next guess must include N? Because we have to use that information.

Yes, important: since we know N is present, we should include it to narrow down its position.

Similarly for C, but C is harder to place? But we have to include C too.

In STOIC, it has C but no N? So we wouldn't be including N, which is bad? Because we know N is in the word, if we don't put N, we get zero information about its position? We might get 'x' for N if we dont put it? But it will appear as not tested.

For efficiency, we should include both known present letters: C and N.

So words without C or without N are wasteful.

Therefore, pin point: must include C and N, must exclude R, A, E.

So back to SCION or SONIC.

SCION: S-C-I-O-N, positions: S1, C2, I3, O4, N5.

SONIC: S1, O2, N3, I4, C5.

Both are valid.

I'll go with ""SCION"" because it tests C in position2 which is common? And S at position1.

Also, SCION is a word meaning a descendant.

After this, we can get feedback on where C and N are, plus the letters S,I,O.

So <guess>SCION</guess>

But let's double-check the previous feedback: we had CRANE -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x). So secret word must have C and N, no R,A,E.

SCION: S,C,I,O,N - all valid letters? S: new, C: known, I: new, O: new, N: known.

Yes.

Perhaps ""MINCE""? M,I,N,C,E? E is forbidden? We know E is not in word? So MINCE has E? So invalid? E is excluded.

Therefore, SCION and SONIC avoid excluded letters.

I think SCION is a good guess.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Therefore:
- The secret word contains C and N, excludes R, A, and E.
- C must be in a position other than 1 (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).
- N must be in a position other than 4 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- The next guess must include C and N, exclude R, A, and E, and test new letters to maximize information.

For the second guess, ""SCION"" is chosen because:
- It includes both C and N (C at position 2, N at position 5—both are new positions since C’s previous position was 1 and N’s was 4).
- It excludes R, A, and E.
- It tests new letters (S at position 1, I at position 3, O at position 4), covering high-frequency consonants and vowels.
- The word is valid (5-letter English word) and helps probe potential positions for C and N while gathering data on S, I, and O.

<guess>SCION</guess>",SCION,"We are given feedback for our first guess:
- C: '-' meaning C is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 1)
- R: 'x' meaning R is not in the secret word at all
- A: 'x' meaning A is not in the secret word
- N: '-' meaning N is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in CRANE)
- E: 'x' meaning E is not in the secret word

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters C and N, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- The secret word does NOT contain R, A, or E.

Also, since C and N are present, but not in their guessed positions, we can deduce:
- C must appear in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not position 1).
- N must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not position 4).

Moreover, we know the secret word has no R, A, E.

Now, for our second guess:
- We must include C and N (since they are in the word).
- We should exclude R, A, E.
- We need to try to put C and N in positions where they might be correct, and also include new letters to test.

Constraints on positions for C and N:
- C cannot be in position 1 again. Possible positions: 2,3,4,5.
- N cannot be in position 4 again. Possible positions:1,2,3,5.

We also want to test other common letters (since R,A,E are out) that might be in the word. Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

Let's think of a word that:
- Contains C and N.
- Does not contain R,A,E.
- Places C in one of positions 2,3,4,5 and N in a position not 4 (i.e., 1,2,3,5).

To maximize information, we can try to put C and N in positions they haven't been tried yet, and also test new positions.

In our first guess:
- C was in position 1
- N was in position 4

So for C: we can try position 2,3,4 or5. Similarly, N: try position 1,2,3,5.

Now, can we put both in positions that are different? Also, we have 3 other letters to choose.

Let me list some possible words.

Since C cannot be in position1, and we know position1 is not C, and not R,A,E. But we don't know position1. It must be a letter that isn't C (but C is elsewhere), and not R,A,E.

Also, position1 cannot be the same as the letters excluded? All positions must not be R,A,E since they are not in the word.

Similarly, position3 is not A? But A is not in the word, so position3 cannot be A. Actually, no R,A,E anywhere.

Now, we have to choose a word without R,A,E, with C and N, and not place C at position1 or N at position4.

Let me try to think of words that start with different letters, since position1 is unknown.

We can try picking a word with S or T, which are common.

For example, let's try putting C at position 3 and N at position 2? Then the word would be ? N C ? ?

Possible words: 

- Must include N and C.

What if we try something like ""SONIC""? But S is new, O is vowel (but we don't know about O yet), N at position4? But we know N is not in position4 (from feedback: N was in position4 and got '-', meaning it is not correct there). So we cannot put N in position4 again? Actually, we can, but the feedback said N is in the word but not at position4, so if we put it again at position4, it would get '-' again. But it's inefficient. We should put N in a new position to test.

Similarly for C.

So we should avoid position4 for N and position1 for C.

Therefore, ""SONIC"" has N at position4? No: S(1) O(2) N(3) I(4) C(5)? Wait, let me index: 
Position: 1-S, 2-O, 3-N, 4-I, 5-C.

But N is at position3 (not position4), and C is at position5 (not position1). So that works? And it avoids R,A,E.

But let me check the letters: S,O,N,I,C. We don't have R,A,E, so okay.

Is ""SONIC"" valid? Yes, it's a word.

But we also know from feedback that C is in the word but not position1 (which we knew), but in SONIC, C is at position5, so if the secret word has C at position5, it would get '✓'. If not, 'x' or '-'.

Similarly, N is at position3.

But we want to test new positions.

Another option: words beginning with C? But C cannot be position1? Wait, feedback said C is not in position1, and since it's present but not position1, we shouldn't put it at position1 again. So position1 can be something else.

We can put position1 as a new letter, say S or T.

What about ""SNICK""? S,N,I,C,K. But K is new.

""SNICK"" has S at1, N at2, I at3, C at4, K at5. But N is at position2 (not 4), C at position4 (not 1). So positions: avoid position4 for N? Position4 here is C, not N. N is at2.

N is at2 (which is new position compared to previous) and C at4 (which was position1 before? No, C was at1 now at position4).

But ""SNICK"" might be uncommon? Let's see if it's a word.

SNICK: as in snick or snee? It might be acceptable.

But let's think of a word with C and N and common vowels. Vowels: We know no A, E. So vowels left: I,O,U,Y.

We can use O,I,U,Y as vowels.

For example, ""CLINT"": C,L,I,N,T? Positions:1-C,2-L,3-I,4-N,5-T. But C cannot be at position1? Because we have feedback that C is in the word but not position1. So if we put C at1, it would be incorrect. And since we know it's not position1, if we put it there, we lose information? Actually, the feedback would still say '-' if it's in the word but wrong position, but we know position1 is wrong for C, so it's wasteful to put it there again.

Similarly, ""CLINT"" has C at position1? So we'd get '-' for C? And N at position4? But N was previously at position4 and got '-', meaning not position4. Now we're putting N at position4 again? Then it will also give '-'? And we don't test a new position for N.

So we should avoid putting C at position1 and N at position4.

Therefore, ""CLINT"" is not good.

Another word: ""CONIC"": has O and I. Positions:1-C,2-O,3-N,4-I,5-C. Oh wait, two C's? But secret word might have double? Feedback didn't show double, but allowed? Wordle allows doubles? The rules didn't say not to.

But in feedback, each letter is considered? And ""CONIC"" has C at position1 and position5? But we know C is in the word but not position1, so putting at position1 might confuse? And at position5.

But let's see if the secret word has double letters? We don't know.

But for efficiency, we should avoid repeating letters if possible, since we don't know.

Also, C in position1 is not good because we already know position1 is not C.

So better to choose a word with C elsewhere.

Alternative: ""PINCH"" P,I,N,C,H? Positions:1-P,2-I,3-N,4-C,5-H? Then N at position3 (not 4), C at position4 (not 1). So avoid position4 for N? Yes, position3 is new for N.

But also, we have new letters P,I,N,C,H. But N and C are known, P,I,H new.

Also, no vowels? I is vowel? Yes.

But we don't know about I.

Now, let's consider how to cover more common letters.

Since R is out, and E,A out, we have: S, T, L, I, O, U, M, P, D, etc.

Let me think of a word: Maybe ""SCION""?: S,C,I,O,N. Positions:1-S,2-C,3-I,4-O,5-N. Then C at position2 (not position1, good), N at position5 (not position4, good). And letters are all distinct: S,C,I,O,N.

And no R,A,E.

Also, S and T are very common, but T is not included? In this case, we test S, C, I, O, N.

C and N are already known to be present. So we are retesting them? But in different positions, which is good to find the correct spots.

Moreover, we test O and I? Which may or may not be present.

This seems decent.

Another possibility: ""MUNCH""? M,U,N,C,H? Has U and no I or O. But similarly.

""SCION"" seems fine.

""SONIC"": as I thought earlier: S(1) O(2) N(3) I(4) C(5). C at5 and N at3? Both new positions.

In SONIC: position1=S, position2=O, position3=N, position4=I, position5=C.

Compared to SCION? SCION: S,C,I,O,N -> positions:1-S,2-C,3-I,4-O,5-N.

Which is better?

In SONIC, N is at position3 and C at position5.

We don't know which is better.

Both avoid known bad positions.

But in SCION, C is tried at position2 which is a new position and might be correct? Or not.

Similarly for SONIC: C at5 or N at3.

Either is okay.

But let me see the frequency: position2 and position5 might be more common for certain letters? Not sure.

Another word: ""STOIC"": S,T,O,I,C? Positions:1-S,2-T,3-O,4-I,5-C. Then only C at position5? And N is missing? Oh N! We know N must be in the word, so our next guess must include N? Because we have to use that information.

Yes, important: since we know N is present, we should include it to narrow down its position.

Similarly for C, but C is harder to place? But we have to include C too.

In STOIC, it has C but no N? So we wouldn't be including N, which is bad? Because we know N is in the word, if we don't put N, we get zero information about its position? We might get 'x' for N if we dont put it? But it will appear as not tested.

For efficiency, we should include both known present letters: C and N.

So words without C or without N are wasteful.

Therefore, pin point: must include C and N, must exclude R, A, E.

So back to SCION or SONIC.

SCION: S-C-I-O-N, positions: S1, C2, I3, O4, N5.

SONIC: S1, O2, N3, I4, C5.

Both are valid.

I'll go with ""SCION"" because it tests C in position2 which is common? And S at position1.

Also, SCION is a word meaning a descendant.

After this, we can get feedback on where C and N are, plus the letters S,I,O.

So <guess>SCION</guess>

But let's double-check the previous feedback: we had CRANE -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x). So secret word must have C and N, no R,A,E.

SCION: S,C,I,O,N - all valid letters? S: new, C: known, I: new, O: new, N: known.

Yes.

Perhaps ""MINCE""? M,I,N,C,E? E is forbidden? We know E is not in word? So MINCE has E? So invalid? E is excluded.

Therefore, SCION and SONIC avoid excluded letters.

I think SCION is a good guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Therefore:
- The secret word contains C and N, excludes R, A, and E.
- C must be in a position other than 1 (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).
- N must be in a position other than 4 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- The next guess must include C and N, exclude R, A, and E, and test new letters to maximize information.

For the second guess, ""SCION"" is chosen because:
- It includes both C and N (C at position 2, N at position 5—both are new positions since C’s previous position was 1 and N’s was 4).
- It excludes R, A, and E.
- It tests new letters (S at position 1, I at position 3, O at position 4), covering high-frequency consonants and vowels.
- The word is valid (5-letter English word) and helps probe potential positions for C and N while gathering data on S, I, and O.",Guess 2: SCION -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,BUNCH,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make our first guess. Since we have no prior feedback, we should choose a word that can give us maximum information. Typically, words with common letters and minimal repeating letters are chosen.

I recall that in Wordle, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"" are often recommended as starting words because they contain a mix of common consonants and vowels.

One crucial point: The game expects a valid English word. We cannot use non-English words.

I will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and a combination of vowels and consonants.

Let me pick ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It has C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is also a very good starting word because it has two vowels and three consonants, including R, S which are common.

But I remember that ""SLATE"" is often used. 

However, I don't think the exact word matters too much as long as it's balanced. Let me go with ""RAISE"" because it covers A, I (vowels) and R, S, E (which is both vowel and consonant, but E is common).

Another popular one is ""ADIEU"" which has many vowels, but it might not be the best because we get fewer consonants? 

Let me decide: I will use ""CRANE"".

So, my first guess is: CRANE

But note: the example in the instructions used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". So I should avoid using any of these? Actually, we can use any word.

I'll go with ""CRANE"".

After making the guess, we'll get feedback and then we can use that to make the next guess.

But for now, we are only making the first guess.

So, let's output: <guess>CRANE</guess>

Wait, but the format should be exactly: <guess> guessed-word </guess>

So, I will return <guess>CRANE</guess>To start the game, I need to make an initial 5-letter word guess with no prior feedback. My goal is to maximize information by choosing a word with common letters and a mix of vowels/consonants. A strong opening word should:
- Cover frequent letters (e.g., E, A, R, S, T).
- Avoid repeated letters.
- Include vowels to help narrow down possibilities.

I selected **""CRANE""** because:
- It uses five distinct letters.
- Contains three vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N)—note that E is a vowel here.
- Features high-frequency letters (E, R, A), which appear in many English words.
- This word will provide feedback on common characters, helping eliminate large groups for subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess:
- C: '-' meaning C is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 1)
- R: 'x' meaning R is not in the secret word at all
- A: 'x' meaning A is not in the secret word
- N: '-' meaning N is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in CRANE)
- E: 'x' meaning E is not in the secret word

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters C and N, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- The secret word does NOT contain R, A, or E.

Also, since C and N are present, but not in their guessed positions, we can deduce:
- C must appear in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not position 1).
- N must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not position 4).

Moreover, we know the secret word has no R, A, E.

Now, for our second guess:
- We must include C and N (since they are in the word).
- We should exclude R, A, E.
- We need to try to put C and N in positions where they might be correct, and also include new letters to test.

Constraints on positions for C and N:
- C cannot be in position 1 again. Possible positions: 2,3,4,5.
- N cannot be in position 4 again. Possible positions:1,2,3,5.

We also want to test other common letters (since R,A,E are out) that might be in the word. Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

Let's think of a word that:
- Contains C and N.
- Does not contain R,A,E.
- Places C in one of positions 2,3,4,5 and N in a position not 4 (i.e., 1,2,3,5).

To maximize information, we can try to put C and N in positions they haven't been tried yet, and also test new positions.

In our first guess:
- C was in position 1
- N was in position 4

So for C: we can try position 2,3,4 or5. Similarly, N: try position 1,2,3,5.

Now, can we put both in positions that are different? Also, we have 3 other letters to choose.

Let me list some possible words.

Since C cannot be in position1, and we know position1 is not C, and not R,A,E. But we don't know position1. It must be a letter that isn't C (but C is elsewhere), and not R,A,E.

Also, position1 cannot be the same as the letters excluded? All positions must not be R,A,E since they are not in the word.

Similarly, position3 is not A? But A is not in the word, so position3 cannot be A. Actually, no R,A,E anywhere.

Now, we have to choose a word without R,A,E, with C and N, and not place C at position1 or N at position4.

Let me try to think of words that start with different letters, since position1 is unknown.

We can try picking a word with S or T, which are common.

For example, let's try putting C at position 3 and N at position 2? Then the word would be ? N C ? ?

Possible words: 

- Must include N and C.

What if we try something like ""SONIC""? But S is new, O is vowel (but we don't know about O yet), N at position4? But we know N is not in position4 (from feedback: N was in position4 and got '-', meaning it is not correct there). So we cannot put N in position4 again? Actually, we can, but the feedback said N is in the word but not at position4, so if we put it again at position4, it would get '-' again. But it's inefficient. We should put N in a new position to test.

Similarly for C.

So we should avoid position4 for N and position1 for C.

Therefore, ""SONIC"" has N at position4? No: S(1) O(2) N(3) I(4) C(5)? Wait, let me index: 
Position: 1-S, 2-O, 3-N, 4-I, 5-C.

But N is at position3 (not position4), and C is at position5 (not position1). So that works? And it avoids R,A,E.

But let me check the letters: S,O,N,I,C. We don't have R,A,E, so okay.

Is ""SONIC"" valid? Yes, it's a word.

But we also know from feedback that C is in the word but not position1 (which we knew), but in SONIC, C is at position5, so if the secret word has C at position5, it would get '✓'. If not, 'x' or '-'.

Similarly, N is at position3.

But we want to test new positions.

Another option: words beginning with C? But C cannot be position1? Wait, feedback said C is not in position1, and since it's present but not position1, we shouldn't put it at position1 again. So position1 can be something else.

We can put position1 as a new letter, say S or T.

What about ""SNICK""? S,N,I,C,K. But K is new.

""SNICK"" has S at1, N at2, I at3, C at4, K at5. But N is at position2 (not 4), C at position4 (not 1). So positions: avoid position4 for N? Position4 here is C, not N. N is at2.

N is at2 (which is new position compared to previous) and C at4 (which was position1 before? No, C was at1 now at position4).

But ""SNICK"" might be uncommon? Let's see if it's a word.

SNICK: as in snick or snee? It might be acceptable.

But let's think of a word with C and N and common vowels. Vowels: We know no A, E. So vowels left: I,O,U,Y.

We can use O,I,U,Y as vowels.

For example, ""CLINT"": C,L,I,N,T? Positions:1-C,2-L,3-I,4-N,5-T. But C cannot be at position1? Because we have feedback that C is in the word but not position1. So if we put C at1, it would be incorrect. And since we know it's not position1, if we put it there, we lose information? Actually, the feedback would still say '-' if it's in the word but wrong position, but we know position1 is wrong for C, so it's wasteful to put it there again.

Similarly, ""CLINT"" has C at position1? So we'd get '-' for C? And N at position4? But N was previously at position4 and got '-', meaning not position4. Now we're putting N at position4 again? Then it will also give '-'? And we don't test a new position for N.

So we should avoid putting C at position1 and N at position4.

Therefore, ""CLINT"" is not good.

Another word: ""CONIC"": has O and I. Positions:1-C,2-O,3-N,4-I,5-C. Oh wait, two C's? But secret word might have double? Feedback didn't show double, but allowed? Wordle allows doubles? The rules didn't say not to.

But in feedback, each letter is considered? And ""CONIC"" has C at position1 and position5? But we know C is in the word but not position1, so putting at position1 might confuse? And at position5.

But let's see if the secret word has double letters? We don't know.

But for efficiency, we should avoid repeating letters if possible, since we don't know.

Also, C in position1 is not good because we already know position1 is not C.

So better to choose a word with C elsewhere.

Alternative: ""PINCH"" P,I,N,C,H? Positions:1-P,2-I,3-N,4-C,5-H? Then N at position3 (not 4), C at position4 (not 1). So avoid position4 for N? Yes, position3 is new for N.

But also, we have new letters P,I,N,C,H. But N and C are known, P,I,H new.

Also, no vowels? I is vowel? Yes.

But we don't know about I.

Now, let's consider how to cover more common letters.

Since R is out, and E,A out, we have: S, T, L, I, O, U, M, P, D, etc.

Let me think of a word: Maybe ""SCION""?: S,C,I,O,N. Positions:1-S,2-C,3-I,4-O,5-N. Then C at position2 (not position1, good), N at position5 (not position4, good). And letters are all distinct: S,C,I,O,N.

And no R,A,E.

Also, S and T are very common, but T is not included? In this case, we test S, C, I, O, N.

C and N are already known to be present. So we are retesting them? But in different positions, which is good to find the correct spots.

Moreover, we test O and I? Which may or may not be present.

This seems decent.

Another possibility: ""MUNCH""? M,U,N,C,H? Has U and no I or O. But similarly.

""SCION"" seems fine.

""SONIC"": as I thought earlier: S(1) O(2) N(3) I(4) C(5). C at5 and N at3? Both new positions.

In SONIC: position1=S, position2=O, position3=N, position4=I, position5=C.

Compared to SCION? SCION: S,C,I,O,N -> positions:1-S,2-C,3-I,4-O,5-N.

Which is better?

In SONIC, N is at position3 and C at position5.

We don't know which is better.

Both avoid known bad positions.

But in SCION, C is tried at position2 which is a new position and might be correct? Or not.

Similarly for SONIC: C at5 or N at3.

Either is okay.

But let me see the frequency: position2 and position5 might be more common for certain letters? Not sure.

Another word: ""STOIC"": S,T,O,I,C? Positions:1-S,2-T,3-O,4-I,5-C. Then only C at position5? And N is missing? Oh N! We know N must be in the word, so our next guess must include N? Because we have to use that information.

Yes, important: since we know N is present, we should include it to narrow down its position.

Similarly for C, but C is harder to place? But we have to include C too.

In STOIC, it has C but no N? So we wouldn't be including N, which is bad? Because we know N is in the word, if we don't put N, we get zero information about its position? We might get 'x' for N if we dont put it? But it will appear as not tested.

For efficiency, we should include both known present letters: C and N.

So words without C or without N are wasteful.

Therefore, pin point: must include C and N, must exclude R, A, E.

So back to SCION or SONIC.

SCION: S-C-I-O-N, positions: S1, C2, I3, O4, N5.

SONIC: S1, O2, N3, I4, C5.

Both are valid.

I'll go with ""SCION"" because it tests C in position2 which is common? And S at position1.

Also, SCION is a word meaning a descendant.

After this, we can get feedback on where C and N are, plus the letters S,I,O.

So <guess>SCION</guess>

But let's double-check the previous feedback: we had CRANE -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x). So secret word must have C and N, no R,A,E.

SCION: S,C,I,O,N - all valid letters? S: new, C: known, I: new, O: new, N: known.

Yes.

Perhaps ""MINCE""? M,I,N,C,E? E is forbidden? We know E is not in word? So MINCE has E? So invalid? E is excluded.

Therefore, SCION and SONIC avoid excluded letters.

I think SCION is a good guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Therefore:
- The secret word contains C and N, excludes R, A, and E.
- C must be in a position other than 1 (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).
- N must be in a position other than 4 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- The next guess must include C and N, exclude R, A, and E, and test new letters to maximize information.

For the second guess, ""SCION"" is chosen because:
- It includes both C and N (C at position 2, N at position 5—both are new positions since C’s previous position was 1 and N’s was 4).
- It excludes R, A, and E.
- It tests new letters (S at position 1, I at position 3, O at position 4), covering high-frequency consonants and vowels.
- The word is valid (5-letter English word) and helps probe potential positions for C and N while gathering data on S, I, and O.

Typically, words with common letters and minimal repeating letters are chosen.\n\nI recall that in Wordle, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"" are often recommended as starting words because they contain a mix of common consonants and vowels.\n\nOne crucial point: The game expects a valid English word. We cannot use non-English words.\n\nI will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and a combination of vowels and consonants.\n\nLet me pick ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It has C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.\n\nAlternatively, ""RAISE"" is also a very good starting word because it has two vowels and three consonants, including R, S which are common.\n\nBut I remember that ""SLATE"" is often used. \n\nHowever, I don\'t think the exact word matters too much as long as it\'s balanced. Let me go with ""RAISE"" because it covers A, I (vowels) and R, S, E (which is both vowel and consonant, but E is common).\n\nAnother popular one is ""ADIEU"" which has many vowels, but it might not be the best because we get fewer consonants? \n\nLet me decide: I will use ""CRANE"".\n\nSo, my first guess is: CRANE\n\nBut note: the example in the instructions used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". So I should avoid using any of these? Actually, we can use any word.\n\nI\'ll go with ""CRANE"".\n\nAfter making the guess, we\'ll get feedback and then we can use that to make the next guess.\n\nBut for now, we are only making the first guess.\n\nSo, let\'s output: <guess>CRANE</guess>\n\nWait, but the format should be exactly: <guess> guessed-word </guess>\n\nSo, I will return <guess>CRANE</guess>To start the game, I need to make an initial 5-letter word guess with no prior feedback. My goal is to maximize information by choosing a word with common letters and a mix of vowels/consonants. A strong opening word should:\n- Cover frequent letters (e.g., E, A, R, S, T).\n- Avoid repeated letters.\n- Include vowels to help narrow down possibilities.\n\nI selected **""CRANE""** because:\n- It uses five distinct letters.\n- Contains three vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N)—note that E is a vowel here.\n- Features high-frequency letters (E, R, A), which appear in many English words.\n- This word will provide feedback on common characters, helping eliminate large groups for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for our first guess:\n- C: \'-\' meaning C is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 1)\n- R: \'x\' meaning R is not in the secret word at all\n- A: \'x\' meaning A is not in the secret word\n- N: \'-\' meaning N is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in CRANE)\n- E: \'x\' meaning E is not in the secret word\n\nSo, from this, we know:\n- The secret word contains the letters C and N, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.\n- The secret word does NOT contain R, A, or E.\n\nAlso, since C and N are present, but not in their guessed positions, we can deduce:\n- C must appear in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not position 1).\n- N must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not position 4).\n\nMoreover, we know the secret word has no R, A, E.\n\nNow, for our second guess:\n- We must include C and N (since they are in the word).\n- We should exclude R, A, E.\n- We need to try to put C and N in positions where they might be correct, and also include new letters to test.\n\nConstraints on positions for C and N:\n- C cannot be in position 1 again. Possible positions: 2,3,4,5.\n- N cannot be in position 4 again. Possible positions:1,2,3,5.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters (since R,A,E are out) that might be in the word. Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.\n\nLet\'s think of a word that:\n- Contains C and N.\n- Does not contain R,A,E.\n- Places C in one of positions 2,3,4,5 and N in a position not 4 (i.e., 1,2,3,5).\n\nTo maximize information, we can try to put C and N in positions they haven\'t been tried yet, and also test new positions.\n\nIn our first guess:\n- C was in position 1\n- N was in position 4\n\nSo for C: we can try position 2,3,4 or5. Similarly, N: try position 1,2,3,5.\n\nNow, can we put both in positions that are different? Also, we have 3 other letters to choose.\n\nLet me list some possible words.\n\nSince C cannot be in position1, and we know position1 is not C, and not R,A,E. But we don\'t know position1. It must be a letter that isn\'t C (but C is elsewhere), and not R,A,E.\n\nAlso, position1 cannot be the same as the letters excluded? All positions must not be R,A,E since they are not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, position3 is not A? But A is not in the word, so position3 cannot be A. Actually, no R,A,E anywhere.\n\nNow, we have to choose a word without R,A,E, with C and N, and not place C at position1 or N at position4.\n\nLet me try to think of words that start with different letters, since position1 is unknown.\n\nWe can try picking a word with S or T, which are common.\n\nFor example, let\'s try putting C at position 3 and N at position 2? Then the word would be ? N C ? ?\n\nPossible words: \n\n- Must include N and C.\n\nWhat if we try something like ""SONIC""? But S is new, O is vowel (but we don\'t know about O yet), N at position4? But we know N is not in position4 (from feedback: N was in position4 and got \'-\', meaning it is not correct there). So we cannot put N in position4 again? Actually, we can, but the feedback said N is in the word but not at position4, so if we put it again at position4, it would get \'-\' again. But it\'s inefficient. We should put N in a new position to test.\n\nSimilarly for C.\n\nSo we should avoid position4 for N and position1 for C.\n\nTherefore, ""SONIC"" has N at position4? No: S(1) O(2) N(3) I(4) C(5)? Wait, let me index: \nPosition: 1-S, 2-O, 3-N, 4-I, 5-C.\n\nBut N is at position3 (not position4), and C is at position5 (not position1). So that works? And it avoids R,A,E.\n\nBut let me check the letters: S,O,N,I,C. We don\'t have R,A,E, so okay.\n\nIs ""SONIC"" valid? Yes, it\'s a word.\n\nBut we also know from feedback that C is in the word but not position1 (which we knew), but in SONIC, C is at position5, so if the secret word has C at position5, it would get \'✓\'. If not, \'x\' or \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly, N is at position3.\n\nBut we want to test new positions.\n\nAnother option: words beginning with C? But C cannot be position1? Wait, feedback said C is not in position1, and since it\'s present but not position1, we shouldn\'t put it at position1 again. So position1 can be something else.\n\nWe can put position1 as a new letter, say S or T.\n\nWhat about ""SNICK""? S,N,I,C,K. But K is new.\n\n""SNICK"" has S at1, N at2, I at3, C at4, K at5. But N is at position2 (not 4), C at position4 (not 1). So positions: avoid position4 for N? Position4 here is C, not N. N is at2.\n\nN is at2 (which is new position compared to previous) and C at4 (which was position1 before? No, C was at1 now at position4).\n\nBut ""SNICK"" might be uncommon? Let\'s see if it\'s a word.\n\nSNICK: as in snick or snee? It might be acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s think of a word with C and N and common vowels. Vowels: We know no A, E. So vowels left: I,O,U,Y.\n\nWe can use O,I,U,Y as vowels.\n\nFor example, ""CLINT"": C,L,I,N,T? Positions:1-C,2-L,3-I,4-N,5-T. But C cannot be at position1? Because we have feedback that C is in the word but not position1. So if we put C at1, it would be incorrect. And since we know it\'s not position1, if we put it there, we lose information? Actually, the feedback would still say \'-\' if it\'s in the word but wrong position, but we know position1 is wrong for C, so it\'s wasteful to put it there again.\n\nSimilarly, ""CLINT"" has C at position1? So we\'d get \'-\' for C? And N at position4? But N was previously at position4 and got \'-\', meaning not position4. Now we\'re putting N at position4 again? Then it will also give \'-\'? And we don\'t test a new position for N.\n\nSo we should avoid putting C at position1 and N at position4.\n\nTherefore, ""CLINT"" is not good.\n\nAnother word: ""CONIC"": has O and I. Positions:1-C,2-O,3-N,4-I,5-C. Oh wait, two C\'s? But secret word might have double? Feedback didn\'t show double, but allowed? Wordle allows doubles? The rules didn\'t say not to.\n\nBut in feedback, each letter is considered? And ""CONIC"" has C at position1 and position5? But we know C is in the word but not position1, so putting at position1 might confuse? And at position5.\n\nBut let\'s see if the secret word has double letters? We don\'t know.\n\nBut for efficiency, we should avoid repeating letters if possible, since we don\'t know.\n\nAlso, C in position1 is not good because we already know position1 is not C.\n\nSo better to choose a word with C elsewhere.\n\nAlternative: ""PINCH"" P,I,N,C,H? Positions:1-P,2-I,3-N,4-C,5-H? Then N at position3 (not 4), C at position4 (not 1). So avoid position4 for N? Yes, position3 is new for N.\n\nBut also, we have new letters P,I,N,C,H. But N and C are known, P,I,H new.\n\nAlso, no vowels? I is vowel? Yes.\n\nBut we don\'t know about I.\n\nNow, let\'s consider how to cover more common letters.\n\nSince R is out, and E,A out, we have: S, T, L, I, O, U, M, P, D, etc.\n\nLet me think of a word: Maybe ""SCION""?: S,C,I,O,N. Positions:1-S,2-C,3-I,4-O,5-N. Then C at position2 (not position1, good), N at position5 (not position4, good). And letters are all distinct: S,C,I,O,N.\n\nAnd no R,A,E.\n\nAlso, S and T are very common, but T is not included? In this case, we test S, C, I, O, N.\n\nC and N are already known to be present. So we are retesting them? But in different positions, which is good to find the correct spots.\n\nMoreover, we test O and I? Which may or may not be present.\n\nThis seems decent.\n\nAnother possibility: ""MUNCH""? M,U,N,C,H? Has U and no I or O. But similarly.\n\n""SCION"" seems fine.\n\n""SONIC"": as I thought earlier: S(1) O(2) N(3) I(4) C(5). C at5 and N at3? Both new positions.\n\nIn SONIC: position1=S, position2=O, position3=N, position4=I, position5=C.\n\nCompared to SCION? SCION: S,C,I,O,N -> positions:1-S,2-C,3-I,4-O,5-N.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nIn SONIC, N is at position3 and C at position5.\n\nWe don\'t know which is better.\n\nBoth avoid known bad positions.\n\nBut in SCION, C is tried at position2 which is a new position and might be correct? Or not.\n\nSimilarly for SONIC: C at5 or N at3.\n\nEither is okay.\n\nBut let me see the frequency: position2 and position5 might be more common for certain letters? Not sure.\n\nAnother word: ""STOIC"": S,T,O,I,C? Positions:1-S,2-T,3-O,4-I,5-C. Then only C at position5? And N is missing? Oh N! We know N must be in the word, so our next guess must include N? Because we have to use that information.\n\nYes, important: since we know N is present, we should include it to narrow down its position.\n\nSimilarly for C, but C is harder to place? But we have to include C too.\n\nIn STOIC, it has C but no N? So we wouldn\'t be including N, which is bad? Because we know N is in the word, if we don\'t put N, we get zero information about its position? We might get \'x\' for N if we dont put it? But it will appear as not tested.\n\nFor efficiency, we should include both known present letters: C and N.\n\nSo words without C or without N are wasteful.\n\nTherefore, pin point: must include C and N, must exclude R, A, E.\n\nSo back to SCION or SONIC.\n\nSCION: S-C-I-O-N, positions: S1, C2, I3, O4, N5.\n\nSONIC: S1, O2, N3, I4, C5.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SCION"" because it tests C in position2 which is common? And S at position1.\n\nAlso, SCION is a word meaning a descendant.\n\nAfter this, we can get feedback on where C and N are, plus the letters S,I,O.\n\nSo <guess>SCION</guess>\n\nBut let\'s double-check the previous feedback: we had CRANE -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x). So secret word must have C and N, no R,A,E.\n\nSCION: S,C,I,O,N - all valid letters? S: new, C: known, I: new, O: new, N: known.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps ""MINCE""? M,I,N,C,E? E is forbidden? We know E is not in word? So MINCE has E? So invalid? E is excluded.\n\nTherefore, SCION and SONIC avoid excluded letters.\n\nI think SCION is a good guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C is in the word but not in position 1.\n- R is not in the word.\n- A is not in the word.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E is not in the word.\n\nTherefore:\n- The secret word contains C and N, excludes R, A, and E.\n- C must be in a position other than 1 (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).\n- N must be in a position other than 4 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n- The next guess must include C and N, exclude R, A, and E, and test new letters to maximize information.\n\nFor the second guess, ""SCION"" is chosen because:\n- It includes both C and N (C at position 2, N at position 5—both are new positions since C’s previous position was 1 and N’s was 4).\n- It excludes R, A, and E.\n- It tests new letters (S at position 1, I at position 3, O at position 4), covering high-frequency consonants and vowels.\n- The word is valid (5-letter English word) and helps probe potential positions for C and N while gathering data on S, I, and O.\n\n<guess>SCION</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SCION -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: '-' → present but wrong position (not position 1)
- R: 'x' → not in word
- A: 'x' → not in word
- N: '-' → present but wrong position (not position 4)
- E: 'x' → not in word

Second guess: SCION
- S: 'x' → not in word
- C: '-' → present but wrong position (not position 2, because in SCION, C is at position 2)
- I: 'x' → not in word
- O: 'x' → not in word
- N: '-' → present but wrong position (not position 5, because in SCION, N is at position 5)

What we know so far:
- The secret word contains C and N (from both guesses).
- The secret word does not contain R, A, E, S, I, O (all marked 'x' in at least one guess).
- C is not in position 1 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from SCION). So C must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- N is not in position 4 (from CRANE) and not in position 5 (from SCION). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We have constraints on C and N.

Also, since C and N are both present, and we have positions to assign.

Now, the word cannot have R, A, E, S, I, O. So available letters are from the remaining alphabet.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a 5-letter word with C and N, and three other letters from the above, excluding the forbidden ones.

Moreover, we know the positions where C and N cannot be.

Let's list possible positions for C: 3,4,5
For N: 1,2,3

But note: if N is in position 3, then C cannot be in position 3? Well, they could be the same? But no, because if both are in position 3, that would be the same letter? But C and N are different. So they can share a position? No, each position has one letter. So if N is in position 3, then C cannot be in position 3. Similarly, if C is in position 3, N cannot be.

So possible cases:

Case 1: N in position 1, then C in 3,4, or 5
Case 2: N in position 2, then C in 3,4, or 5
Case 3: N in position 3, then C in 4 or 5 (since 3 is taken by N)

Similarly, if C is in 3, then N can be in 1 or 2 (not 3)
If C in 4, N in 1,2,3
If C in 5, N in 1,2,3

But we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong.

Now, we need to choose a word that includes C and N, and three new letters, and places C and N in the possible positions to test.

We also want to test common letters to get more information.

Common letters left: T, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

We should avoid using letters that are already excluded: R, A, E, S, I, O.

Let's think of words that have C and N, and use common letters.

For example, words like ""CLUNK"", ""CHUNK"", ""FUNKY"", but F and K are less common? Or ""PUNCH"", ""LUNCH"", ""BUNCH"", etc.

But we have to consider the position constraints.

Also, we know C cannot be in 1 or 2, so C must be in 3,4,5.

Similarly, N cannot be in 4 or 5, so N must be in 1,2,3.

Let's try to form a word with N in position 1 or 2, and C in 3,4, or 5.

For instance:
- If N is at 1: then the word starts with N. Then C at 3,4, or 5.
  - Examples: ""N"" _ _ _ _ 
    - With C at 3: ""N?C??"", e.g., ""NICHE"" but I is excluded, so not. ""NACHO"" but A excluded. So need letters from available set.
    - Available: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,P,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
    - ""N"" at 1, then position 2: say U (vowel?), position 3: C? Then ""NUC??"" -> ""NUCLE"" but E excluded. ""NUKED"" E excluded. Not many common words.
    - ""N"" at 1, C at 4: ""N? ? C ?"", e.g., ""NIGHT"" but no C? ""NICHT"" not English. ""NATCH"" A excluded. Hard.

- N at 2: then the word has second letter N. C at 3,4,5.
  - Pattern: _ N _ _ _
  - With C at 3: _ N C _ _ , e.g., ""UNCLO"" but O excluded. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""UNCLE"" E excluded. ""UNCUT"" U and T? ""UNCUT"" has U,C,T. But C is at position 3? Let's see: U(1), N(2), C(3), U(4)? No, ""UNCUT"" is U, N, C, U, T? Positions: 1-U, 2-N, 3-C, 4-U, 5-T. But U repeated? And we don't know if U is allowed? We haven't tested U.

But U is not excluded yet, so it could be.

Similarly, ""UNCLY"" not a word.

""BUNCH"": B(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5). But in this case, N is at position 3? And C at position 4.

But we have constraints: N must be in 1,2,3. Here N at 3 is allowed? Yes, because we only know N not at 4 or 5. Similarly, C at 4 is allowed? C can be at 4? Yes, since C not at 1 or 2.

In ""BUNCH"": 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: C
- Position 5: H

Now, N is at 3, which is a possible position. C is at 4, which is also possible.

And letters: B, U, N, C, H. All not excluded? B, U, H are new, N and C known.

But we have to check if U is allowed? We haven't had feedback on U, so it could be in the word or not.

Similarly, B and H.

Also, ""BUNCH"" is a valid word.

Another possibility: ""LUNCH"" L(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) — similar.

Or ""PUNCH"" P(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5)

Now, what about N at 3 and C at 5? For example, ""MINCE"" but E excluded and I excluded? I is excluded. ""DANCE"" A and E excluded. Not good.

C at 5: ""? ? ? ? C"", with N at 1,2, or 3.

If N at 1: ""N ? ? ? C"", e.g., ""NIGHT"" no C. ""NOVEL"" O and E excluded.

If N at 2: ""? N ? ? C"", e.g., ""UNLIT"" no C. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""ONCET"" not word.

If N at 3: ""? ? N ? C"", e.g., ""BENCH"" E excluded. ""PINCH"" I excluded. ""LUNCH"" has C at 4, not 5.

""LUNCH"" has C at 4. To have C at 5, we need words like ""PUNCH"" same as above? ""PUNCH"" is P,U,N,C,H — C at 4.

What about ""CLANK""? C at 1? But C cannot be at 1. Not allowed.

""KNACK"" has double C? But C at 4 and 5? But we know C is present, but not necessarily double. And K at 1, N at 2, A at 3? A excluded.

Not good.

So back to ""BUNCH"" or ""LUNCH"" or ""PUNCH"".

In these, N is at position 3 and C at position 4.

We also have the possibility of C at position 3 and N at position 1 or 2.

For example, C at 3: then N at 1 or 2.

If N at 1: ""N ? C ? ?"", e.g., ""NICHE"" I excluded. ""NACHO"" A excluded. ""NECKS"" E excluded. Not many options.

If N at 2: ""? N C ? ?"", e.g., ""UNCLE"" E excluded. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""ONCET"" not word. ""ANCHO"" A excluded.

So it seems difficult to find words with C at 3 and N at 1 or 2 without using excluded letters.

Therefore, the most feasible are words with N at 3 and C at 4, like ""BUNCH"", ""LUNCH"", ""PUNCH"", ""HUNCH"", etc.

We can also consider C at 5? But we don't have a common word with C at 5 and N at 1,2,3 without excluded letters.

For example, ""TRUNC"" not a word. ""CLINK"" C at 1 not allowed.

""ZINC"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

So let's go with ""PUNCH"" or ""LUNCH"".

But we need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have to avoid S, I, O, R, A, E.

Available vowels: U and Y? And consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, etc.

In ""PUNCH"", we have P, U, N, C, H.

U is a vowel, which is good to test.

Similarly, in ""LUNCH"", L, U, N, C, H.

We don't know about U, P, L, H.

We can choose either.

But let's see if we can include T, which is very common.

For example, ""PUNCH"" doesn't have T. ""LUNCH"" doesn't.

What about ""HUNCH""? Same as above.

Or ""CLUNK""? C at 1 not allowed.

""FUNKY""? F,U,N,K,Y. But C is missing? We must include C.

We must include both C and N.

Another idea: ""NICHT"" not English.

""YUCKY"" no N or C? Not.

So I think ""PUNCH"" is a good candidate.

But let's confirm the positions: in ""PUNCH"", P at 1, U at 2, N at 3, C at 4, H at 5.

Now, for N: position 3 is new (previously tried at 4 and 5, both wrong). For C: position 4 is new (previously tried at 1 and 2, both wrong).

So we are testing new positions for both.

Also, we test P, U, H.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another word: ""MUNCH"" M,U,N,C,H.

Similarly.

I think ""PUNCH"" is fine.

But let's see if there is a word with T.

For example, ""NUTTY"" no C. ""CUTIN"" I excluded. ""CANTY"" A excluded.

Not easy.

""COUNT"" O excluded. ""JOINT"" O and I excluded? O and I are excluded.

So I think ""PUNCH"" is acceptable.

We'll go with ""PUNCH"".

But in the feedback, we might get information about U, P, H.

If U is not in the word, we know, etc.

So <guess>PUNCH</guess>

But let's write it.
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - R, A, E are not in the word.  
  - N is in the word but not in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: SCION**  
  Feedback: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - S, I, O are not in the word.  
  - C is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - N is in the word but not in position 5.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters in the Word**:  
   - C and N must be present (both received ""-"" in feedback, indicating they are in the word but misplaced).  
   - C cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from CRANE and SCION feedback).  
   - N cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from CRANE and SCION feedback).  
   - Therefore, C must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - R, A, E (from CRANE), S, I, O (from SCION) are not in the word.  
   - Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and Y can act as a vowel).  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include C and N to test their valid positions (C: 3,4,5; N: 1,2,3).  
   - Avoid excluded letters (R, A, E, S, I, O).  
   - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, L, U, H, P) to gather more information.  
   - Prioritize words where C and N are placed in new untested positions to resolve ambiguity:  
     - C was previously in position 1 (CRANE) and 2 (SCION), so test position 3, 4, or 5.  
     - N was previously in position 4 (CRANE) and 5 (SCION), so test position 1, 2, or 3.  
   - Given the constraints, words like **PUNCH** (C at position 4, N at position 3) or **LUNCH** (same positions) are strong candidates. They use common letters (U, H, P/L) and fit the positional rules.  

**Chosen Guess: PUNCH**  
- **Why PUNCH?**  
  - Contains C (position 4) and N (position 3), both in new valid positions.  
  - Uses new letters: P (position 1), U (position 2), H (position 5) — all untested and common.  
  - Avoids excluded letters (R, A, E, S, I, O).  
  - If U is in the word, feedback will confirm it (and whether it's in position 2). Similarly, P and H will be tested.  
  - This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for C and N while probing new letters.  

<guess>PUNCH</guess>",PUNCH,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: '-' → present but wrong position (not position 1)
- R: 'x' → not in word
- A: 'x' → not in word
- N: '-' → present but wrong position (not position 4)
- E: 'x' → not in word

Second guess: SCION
- S: 'x' → not in word
- C: '-' → present but wrong position (not position 2, because in SCION, C is at position 2)
- I: 'x' → not in word
- O: 'x' → not in word
- N: '-' → present but wrong position (not position 5, because in SCION, N is at position 5)

What we know so far:
- The secret word contains C and N (from both guesses).
- The secret word does not contain R, A, E, S, I, O (all marked 'x' in at least one guess).
- C is not in position 1 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from SCION). So C must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- N is not in position 4 (from CRANE) and not in position 5 (from SCION). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We have constraints on C and N.

Also, since C and N are both present, and we have positions to assign.

Now, the word cannot have R, A, E, S, I, O. So available letters are from the remaining alphabet.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a 5-letter word with C and N, and three other letters from the above, excluding the forbidden ones.

Moreover, we know the positions where C and N cannot be.

Let's list possible positions for C: 3,4,5
For N: 1,2,3

But note: if N is in position 3, then C cannot be in position 3? Well, they could be the same? But no, because if both are in position 3, that would be the same letter? But C and N are different. So they can share a position? No, each position has one letter. So if N is in position 3, then C cannot be in position 3. Similarly, if C is in position 3, N cannot be.

So possible cases:

Case 1: N in position 1, then C in 3,4, or 5
Case 2: N in position 2, then C in 3,4, or 5
Case 3: N in position 3, then C in 4 or 5 (since 3 is taken by N)

Similarly, if C is in 3, then N can be in 1 or 2 (not 3)
If C in 4, N in 1,2,3
If C in 5, N in 1,2,3

But we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong.

Now, we need to choose a word that includes C and N, and three new letters, and places C and N in the possible positions to test.

We also want to test common letters to get more information.

Common letters left: T, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

We should avoid using letters that are already excluded: R, A, E, S, I, O.

Let's think of words that have C and N, and use common letters.

For example, words like ""CLUNK"", ""CHUNK"", ""FUNKY"", but F and K are less common? Or ""PUNCH"", ""LUNCH"", ""BUNCH"", etc.

But we have to consider the position constraints.

Also, we know C cannot be in 1 or 2, so C must be in 3,4,5.

Similarly, N cannot be in 4 or 5, so N must be in 1,2,3.

Let's try to form a word with N in position 1 or 2, and C in 3,4, or 5.

For instance:
- If N is at 1: then the word starts with N. Then C at 3,4, or 5.
  - Examples: ""N"" _ _ _ _ 
    - With C at 3: ""N?C??"", e.g., ""NICHE"" but I is excluded, so not. ""NACHO"" but A excluded. So need letters from available set.
    - Available: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,P,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
    - ""N"" at 1, then position 2: say U (vowel?), position 3: C? Then ""NUC??"" -> ""NUCLE"" but E excluded. ""NUKED"" E excluded. Not many common words.
    - ""N"" at 1, C at 4: ""N? ? C ?"", e.g., ""NIGHT"" but no C? ""NICHT"" not English. ""NATCH"" A excluded. Hard.

- N at 2: then the word has second letter N. C at 3,4,5.
  - Pattern: _ N _ _ _
  - With C at 3: _ N C _ _ , e.g., ""UNCLO"" but O excluded. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""UNCLE"" E excluded. ""UNCUT"" U and T? ""UNCUT"" has U,C,T. But C is at position 3? Let's see: U(1), N(2), C(3), U(4)? No, ""UNCUT"" is U, N, C, U, T? Positions: 1-U, 2-N, 3-C, 4-U, 5-T. But U repeated? And we don't know if U is allowed? We haven't tested U.

But U is not excluded yet, so it could be.

Similarly, ""UNCLY"" not a word.

""BUNCH"": B(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5). But in this case, N is at position 3? And C at position 4.

But we have constraints: N must be in 1,2,3. Here N at 3 is allowed? Yes, because we only know N not at 4 or 5. Similarly, C at 4 is allowed? C can be at 4? Yes, since C not at 1 or 2.

In ""BUNCH"": 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: C
- Position 5: H

Now, N is at 3, which is a possible position. C is at 4, which is also possible.

And letters: B, U, N, C, H. All not excluded? B, U, H are new, N and C known.

But we have to check if U is allowed? We haven't had feedback on U, so it could be in the word or not.

Similarly, B and H.

Also, ""BUNCH"" is a valid word.

Another possibility: ""LUNCH"" L(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) — similar.

Or ""PUNCH"" P(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5)

Now, what about N at 3 and C at 5? For example, ""MINCE"" but E excluded and I excluded? I is excluded. ""DANCE"" A and E excluded. Not good.

C at 5: ""? ? ? ? C"", with N at 1,2, or 3.

If N at 1: ""N ? ? ? C"", e.g., ""NIGHT"" no C. ""NOVEL"" O and E excluded.

If N at 2: ""? N ? ? C"", e.g., ""UNLIT"" no C. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""ONCET"" not word.

If N at 3: ""? ? N ? C"", e.g., ""BENCH"" E excluded. ""PINCH"" I excluded. ""LUNCH"" has C at 4, not 5.

""LUNCH"" has C at 4. To have C at 5, we need words like ""PUNCH"" same as above? ""PUNCH"" is P,U,N,C,H — C at 4.

What about ""CLANK""? C at 1? But C cannot be at 1. Not allowed.

""KNACK"" has double C? But C at 4 and 5? But we know C is present, but not necessarily double. And K at 1, N at 2, A at 3? A excluded.

Not good.

So back to ""BUNCH"" or ""LUNCH"" or ""PUNCH"".

In these, N is at position 3 and C at position 4.

We also have the possibility of C at position 3 and N at position 1 or 2.

For example, C at 3: then N at 1 or 2.

If N at 1: ""N ? C ? ?"", e.g., ""NICHE"" I excluded. ""NACHO"" A excluded. ""NECKS"" E excluded. Not many options.

If N at 2: ""? N C ? ?"", e.g., ""UNCLE"" E excluded. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""ONCET"" not word. ""ANCHO"" A excluded.

So it seems difficult to find words with C at 3 and N at 1 or 2 without using excluded letters.

Therefore, the most feasible are words with N at 3 and C at 4, like ""BUNCH"", ""LUNCH"", ""PUNCH"", ""HUNCH"", etc.

We can also consider C at 5? But we don't have a common word with C at 5 and N at 1,2,3 without excluded letters.

For example, ""TRUNC"" not a word. ""CLINK"" C at 1 not allowed.

""ZINC"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

So let's go with ""PUNCH"" or ""LUNCH"".

But we need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have to avoid S, I, O, R, A, E.

Available vowels: U and Y? And consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, etc.

In ""PUNCH"", we have P, U, N, C, H.

U is a vowel, which is good to test.

Similarly, in ""LUNCH"", L, U, N, C, H.

We don't know about U, P, L, H.

We can choose either.

But let's see if we can include T, which is very common.

For example, ""PUNCH"" doesn't have T. ""LUNCH"" doesn't.

What about ""HUNCH""? Same as above.

Or ""CLUNK""? C at 1 not allowed.

""FUNKY""? F,U,N,K,Y. But C is missing? We must include C.

We must include both C and N.

Another idea: ""NICHT"" not English.

""YUCKY"" no N or C? Not.

So I think ""PUNCH"" is a good candidate.

But let's confirm the positions: in ""PUNCH"", P at 1, U at 2, N at 3, C at 4, H at 5.

Now, for N: position 3 is new (previously tried at 4 and 5, both wrong). For C: position 4 is new (previously tried at 1 and 2, both wrong).

So we are testing new positions for both.

Also, we test P, U, H.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another word: ""MUNCH"" M,U,N,C,H.

Similarly.

I think ""PUNCH"" is fine.

But let's see if there is a word with T.

For example, ""NUTTY"" no C. ""CUTIN"" I excluded. ""CANTY"" A excluded.

Not easy.

""COUNT"" O excluded. ""JOINT"" O and I excluded? O and I are excluded.

So I think ""PUNCH"" is acceptable.

We'll go with ""PUNCH"".

But in the feedback, we might get information about U, P, H.

If U is not in the word, we know, etc.

So <guess>PUNCH</guess>

But let's write it.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - R, A, E are not in the word.  
  - N is in the word but not in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: SCION**  
  Feedback: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - S, I, O are not in the word.  
  - C is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - N is in the word but not in position 5.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters in the Word**:  
   - C and N must be present (both received ""-"" in feedback, indicating they are in the word but misplaced).  
   - C cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from CRANE and SCION feedback).  
   - N cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from CRANE and SCION feedback).  
   - Therefore, C must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - R, A, E (from CRANE), S, I, O (from SCION) are not in the word.  
   - Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and Y can act as a vowel).  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include C and N to test their valid positions (C: 3,4,5; N: 1,2,3).  
   - Avoid excluded letters (R, A, E, S, I, O).  
   - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, L, U, H, P) to gather more information.  
   - Prioritize words where C and N are placed in new untested positions to resolve ambiguity:  
     - C was previously in position 1 (CRANE) and 2 (SCION), so test position 3, 4, or 5.  
     - N was previously in position 4 (CRANE) and 5 (SCION), so test position 1, 2, or 3.  
   - Given the constraints, words like **PUNCH** (C at position 4, N at position 3) or **LUNCH** (same positions) are strong candidates. They use common letters (U, H, P/L) and fit the positional rules.  

**Chosen Guess: PUNCH**  
- **Why PUNCH?**  
  - Contains C (position 4) and N (position 3), both in new valid positions.  
  - Uses new letters: P (position 1), U (position 2), H (position 5) — all untested and common.  
  - Avoids excluded letters (R, A, E, S, I, O).  
  - If U is in the word, feedback will confirm it (and whether it's in position 2). Similarly, P and H will be tested.  
  - This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for C and N while probing new letters.",Guess 3: PUNCH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) N(✓) C(✓) H(✓),FAIL

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make our first guess. Since we have no prior feedback, we should choose a word that can give us maximum information. Typically, words with common letters and minimal repeating letters are chosen.

I recall that in Wordle, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"" are often recommended as starting words because they contain a mix of common consonants and vowels.

One crucial point: The game expects a valid English word. We cannot use non-English words.

I will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and a combination of vowels and consonants.

Let me pick ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It has C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is also a very good starting word because it has two vowels and three consonants, including R, S which are common.

But I remember that ""SLATE"" is often used. 

However, I don't think the exact word matters too much as long as it's balanced. Let me go with ""RAISE"" because it covers A, I (vowels) and R, S, E (which is both vowel and consonant, but E is common).

Another popular one is ""ADIEU"" which has many vowels, but it might not be the best because we get fewer consonants? 

Let me decide: I will use ""CRANE"".

So, my first guess is: CRANE

But note: the example in the instructions used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". So I should avoid using any of these? Actually, we can use any word.

I'll go with ""CRANE"".

After making the guess, we'll get feedback and then we can use that to make the next guess.

But for now, we are only making the first guess.

So, let's output: <guess>CRANE</guess>

Wait, but the format should be exactly: <guess> guessed-word </guess>

So, I will return <guess>CRANE</guess>To start the game, I need to make an initial 5-letter word guess with no prior feedback. My goal is to maximize information by choosing a word with common letters and a mix of vowels/consonants. A strong opening word should:
- Cover frequent letters (e.g., E, A, R, S, T).
- Avoid repeated letters.
- Include vowels to help narrow down possibilities.

I selected **""CRANE""** because:
- It uses five distinct letters.
- Contains three vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N)—note that E is a vowel here.
- Features high-frequency letters (E, R, A), which appear in many English words.
- This word will provide feedback on common characters, helping eliminate large groups for subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess:
- C: '-' meaning C is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 1)
- R: 'x' meaning R is not in the secret word at all
- A: 'x' meaning A is not in the secret word
- N: '-' meaning N is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in CRANE)
- E: 'x' meaning E is not in the secret word

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters C and N, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- The secret word does NOT contain R, A, or E.

Also, since C and N are present, but not in their guessed positions, we can deduce:
- C must appear in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not position 1).
- N must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not position 4).

Moreover, we know the secret word has no R, A, E.

Now, for our second guess:
- We must include C and N (since they are in the word).
- We should exclude R, A, E.
- We need to try to put C and N in positions where they might be correct, and also include new letters to test.

Constraints on positions for C and N:
- C cannot be in position 1 again. Possible positions: 2,3,4,5.
- N cannot be in position 4 again. Possible positions:1,2,3,5.

We also want to test other common letters (since R,A,E are out) that might be in the word. Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

Let's think of a word that:
- Contains C and N.
- Does not contain R,A,E.
- Places C in one of positions 2,3,4,5 and N in a position not 4 (i.e., 1,2,3,5).

To maximize information, we can try to put C and N in positions they haven't been tried yet, and also test new positions.

In our first guess:
- C was in position 1
- N was in position 4

So for C: we can try position 2,3,4 or5. Similarly, N: try position 1,2,3,5.

Now, can we put both in positions that are different? Also, we have 3 other letters to choose.

Let me list some possible words.

Since C cannot be in position1, and we know position1 is not C, and not R,A,E. But we don't know position1. It must be a letter that isn't C (but C is elsewhere), and not R,A,E.

Also, position1 cannot be the same as the letters excluded? All positions must not be R,A,E since they are not in the word.

Similarly, position3 is not A? But A is not in the word, so position3 cannot be A. Actually, no R,A,E anywhere.

Now, we have to choose a word without R,A,E, with C and N, and not place C at position1 or N at position4.

Let me try to think of words that start with different letters, since position1 is unknown.

We can try picking a word with S or T, which are common.

For example, let's try putting C at position 3 and N at position 2? Then the word would be ? N C ? ?

Possible words: 

- Must include N and C.

What if we try something like ""SONIC""? But S is new, O is vowel (but we don't know about O yet), N at position4? But we know N is not in position4 (from feedback: N was in position4 and got '-', meaning it is not correct there). So we cannot put N in position4 again? Actually, we can, but the feedback said N is in the word but not at position4, so if we put it again at position4, it would get '-' again. But it's inefficient. We should put N in a new position to test.

Similarly for C.

So we should avoid position4 for N and position1 for C.

Therefore, ""SONIC"" has N at position4? No: S(1) O(2) N(3) I(4) C(5)? Wait, let me index: 
Position: 1-S, 2-O, 3-N, 4-I, 5-C.

But N is at position3 (not position4), and C is at position5 (not position1). So that works? And it avoids R,A,E.

But let me check the letters: S,O,N,I,C. We don't have R,A,E, so okay.

Is ""SONIC"" valid? Yes, it's a word.

But we also know from feedback that C is in the word but not position1 (which we knew), but in SONIC, C is at position5, so if the secret word has C at position5, it would get '✓'. If not, 'x' or '-'.

Similarly, N is at position3.

But we want to test new positions.

Another option: words beginning with C? But C cannot be position1? Wait, feedback said C is not in position1, and since it's present but not position1, we shouldn't put it at position1 again. So position1 can be something else.

We can put position1 as a new letter, say S or T.

What about ""SNICK""? S,N,I,C,K. But K is new.

""SNICK"" has S at1, N at2, I at3, C at4, K at5. But N is at position2 (not 4), C at position4 (not 1). So positions: avoid position4 for N? Position4 here is C, not N. N is at2.

N is at2 (which is new position compared to previous) and C at4 (which was position1 before? No, C was at1 now at position4).

But ""SNICK"" might be uncommon? Let's see if it's a word.

SNICK: as in snick or snee? It might be acceptable.

But let's think of a word with C and N and common vowels. Vowels: We know no A, E. So vowels left: I,O,U,Y.

We can use O,I,U,Y as vowels.

For example, ""CLINT"": C,L,I,N,T? Positions:1-C,2-L,3-I,4-N,5-T. But C cannot be at position1? Because we have feedback that C is in the word but not position1. So if we put C at1, it would be incorrect. And since we know it's not position1, if we put it there, we lose information? Actually, the feedback would still say '-' if it's in the word but wrong position, but we know position1 is wrong for C, so it's wasteful to put it there again.

Similarly, ""CLINT"" has C at position1? So we'd get '-' for C? And N at position4? But N was previously at position4 and got '-', meaning not position4. Now we're putting N at position4 again? Then it will also give '-'? And we don't test a new position for N.

So we should avoid putting C at position1 and N at position4.

Therefore, ""CLINT"" is not good.

Another word: ""CONIC"": has O and I. Positions:1-C,2-O,3-N,4-I,5-C. Oh wait, two C's? But secret word might have double? Feedback didn't show double, but allowed? Wordle allows doubles? The rules didn't say not to.

But in feedback, each letter is considered? And ""CONIC"" has C at position1 and position5? But we know C is in the word but not position1, so putting at position1 might confuse? And at position5.

But let's see if the secret word has double letters? We don't know.

But for efficiency, we should avoid repeating letters if possible, since we don't know.

Also, C in position1 is not good because we already know position1 is not C.

So better to choose a word with C elsewhere.

Alternative: ""PINCH"" P,I,N,C,H? Positions:1-P,2-I,3-N,4-C,5-H? Then N at position3 (not 4), C at position4 (not 1). So avoid position4 for N? Yes, position3 is new for N.

But also, we have new letters P,I,N,C,H. But N and C are known, P,I,H new.

Also, no vowels? I is vowel? Yes.

But we don't know about I.

Now, let's consider how to cover more common letters.

Since R is out, and E,A out, we have: S, T, L, I, O, U, M, P, D, etc.

Let me think of a word: Maybe ""SCION""?: S,C,I,O,N. Positions:1-S,2-C,3-I,4-O,5-N. Then C at position2 (not position1, good), N at position5 (not position4, good). And letters are all distinct: S,C,I,O,N.

And no R,A,E.

Also, S and T are very common, but T is not included? In this case, we test S, C, I, O, N.

C and N are already known to be present. So we are retesting them? But in different positions, which is good to find the correct spots.

Moreover, we test O and I? Which may or may not be present.

This seems decent.

Another possibility: ""MUNCH""? M,U,N,C,H? Has U and no I or O. But similarly.

""SCION"" seems fine.

""SONIC"": as I thought earlier: S(1) O(2) N(3) I(4) C(5). C at5 and N at3? Both new positions.

In SONIC: position1=S, position2=O, position3=N, position4=I, position5=C.

Compared to SCION? SCION: S,C,I,O,N -> positions:1-S,2-C,3-I,4-O,5-N.

Which is better?

In SONIC, N is at position3 and C at position5.

We don't know which is better.

Both avoid known bad positions.

But in SCION, C is tried at position2 which is a new position and might be correct? Or not.

Similarly for SONIC: C at5 or N at3.

Either is okay.

But let me see the frequency: position2 and position5 might be more common for certain letters? Not sure.

Another word: ""STOIC"": S,T,O,I,C? Positions:1-S,2-T,3-O,4-I,5-C. Then only C at position5? And N is missing? Oh N! We know N must be in the word, so our next guess must include N? Because we have to use that information.

Yes, important: since we know N is present, we should include it to narrow down its position.

Similarly for C, but C is harder to place? But we have to include C too.

In STOIC, it has C but no N? So we wouldn't be including N, which is bad? Because we know N is in the word, if we don't put N, we get zero information about its position? We might get 'x' for N if we dont put it? But it will appear as not tested.

For efficiency, we should include both known present letters: C and N.

So words without C or without N are wasteful.

Therefore, pin point: must include C and N, must exclude R, A, E.

So back to SCION or SONIC.

SCION: S-C-I-O-N, positions: S1, C2, I3, O4, N5.

SONIC: S1, O2, N3, I4, C5.

Both are valid.

I'll go with ""SCION"" because it tests C in position2 which is common? And S at position1.

Also, SCION is a word meaning a descendant.

After this, we can get feedback on where C and N are, plus the letters S,I,O.

So <guess>SCION</guess>

But let's double-check the previous feedback: we had CRANE -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x). So secret word must have C and N, no R,A,E.

SCION: S,C,I,O,N - all valid letters? S: new, C: known, I: new, O: new, N: known.

Yes.

Perhaps ""MINCE""? M,I,N,C,E? E is forbidden? We know E is not in word? So MINCE has E? So invalid? E is excluded.

Therefore, SCION and SONIC avoid excluded letters.

I think SCION is a good guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Therefore:
- The secret word contains C and N, excludes R, A, and E.
- C must be in a position other than 1 (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).
- N must be in a position other than 4 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- The next guess must include C and N, exclude R, A, and E, and test new letters to maximize information.

For the second guess, ""SCION"" is chosen because:
- It includes both C and N (C at position 2, N at position 5—both are new positions since C’s previous position was 1 and N’s was 4).
- It excludes R, A, and E.
- It tests new letters (S at position 1, I at position 3, O at position 4), covering high-frequency consonants and vowels.
- The word is valid (5-letter English word) and helps probe potential positions for C and N while gathering data on S, I, and O.

<guess>SCION</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SCION -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: '-' → present but wrong position (not position 1)
- R: 'x' → not in word
- A: 'x' → not in word
- N: '-' → present but wrong position (not position 4)
- E: 'x' → not in word

Second guess: SCION
- S: 'x' → not in word
- C: '-' → present but wrong position (not position 2, because in SCION, C is at position 2)
- I: 'x' → not in word
- O: 'x' → not in word
- N: '-' → present but wrong position (not position 5, because in SCION, N is at position 5)

What we know so far:
- The secret word contains C and N (from both guesses).
- The secret word does not contain R, A, E, S, I, O (all marked 'x' in at least one guess).
- C is not in position 1 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from SCION). So C must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- N is not in position 4 (from CRANE) and not in position 5 (from SCION). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We have constraints on C and N.

Also, since C and N are both present, and we have positions to assign.

Now, the word cannot have R, A, E, S, I, O. So available letters are from the remaining alphabet.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a 5-letter word with C and N, and three other letters from the above, excluding the forbidden ones.

Moreover, we know the positions where C and N cannot be.

Let's list possible positions for C: 3,4,5
For N: 1,2,3

But note: if N is in position 3, then C cannot be in position 3? Well, they could be the same? But no, because if both are in position 3, that would be the same letter? But C and N are different. So they can share a position? No, each position has one letter. So if N is in position 3, then C cannot be in position 3. Similarly, if C is in position 3, N cannot be.

So possible cases:

Case 1: N in position 1, then C in 3,4, or 5
Case 2: N in position 2, then C in 3,4, or 5
Case 3: N in position 3, then C in 4 or 5 (since 3 is taken by N)

Similarly, if C is in 3, then N can be in 1 or 2 (not 3)
If C in 4, N in 1,2,3
If C in 5, N in 1,2,3

But we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong.

Now, we need to choose a word that includes C and N, and three new letters, and places C and N in the possible positions to test.

We also want to test common letters to get more information.

Common letters left: T, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

We should avoid using letters that are already excluded: R, A, E, S, I, O.

Let's think of words that have C and N, and use common letters.

For example, words like ""CLUNK"", ""CHUNK"", ""FUNKY"", but F and K are less common? Or ""PUNCH"", ""LUNCH"", ""BUNCH"", etc.

But we have to consider the position constraints.

Also, we know C cannot be in 1 or 2, so C must be in 3,4,5.

Similarly, N cannot be in 4 or 5, so N must be in 1,2,3.

Let's try to form a word with N in position 1 or 2, and C in 3,4, or 5.

For instance:
- If N is at 1: then the word starts with N. Then C at 3,4, or 5.
  - Examples: ""N"" _ _ _ _ 
    - With C at 3: ""N?C??"", e.g., ""NICHE"" but I is excluded, so not. ""NACHO"" but A excluded. So need letters from available set.
    - Available: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,P,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
    - ""N"" at 1, then position 2: say U (vowel?), position 3: C? Then ""NUC??"" -> ""NUCLE"" but E excluded. ""NUKED"" E excluded. Not many common words.
    - ""N"" at 1, C at 4: ""N? ? C ?"", e.g., ""NIGHT"" but no C? ""NICHT"" not English. ""NATCH"" A excluded. Hard.

- N at 2: then the word has second letter N. C at 3,4,5.
  - Pattern: _ N _ _ _
  - With C at 3: _ N C _ _ , e.g., ""UNCLO"" but O excluded. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""UNCLE"" E excluded. ""UNCUT"" U and T? ""UNCUT"" has U,C,T. But C is at position 3? Let's see: U(1), N(2), C(3), U(4)? No, ""UNCUT"" is U, N, C, U, T? Positions: 1-U, 2-N, 3-C, 4-U, 5-T. But U repeated? And we don't know if U is allowed? We haven't tested U.

But U is not excluded yet, so it could be.

Similarly, ""UNCLY"" not a word.

""BUNCH"": B(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5). But in this case, N is at position 3? And C at position 4.

But we have constraints: N must be in 1,2,3. Here N at 3 is allowed? Yes, because we only know N not at 4 or 5. Similarly, C at 4 is allowed? C can be at 4? Yes, since C not at 1 or 2.

In ""BUNCH"": 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: C
- Position 5: H

Now, N is at 3, which is a possible position. C is at 4, which is also possible.

And letters: B, U, N, C, H. All not excluded? B, U, H are new, N and C known.

But we have to check if U is allowed? We haven't had feedback on U, so it could be in the word or not.

Similarly, B and H.

Also, ""BUNCH"" is a valid word.

Another possibility: ""LUNCH"" L(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) — similar.

Or ""PUNCH"" P(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5)

Now, what about N at 3 and C at 5? For example, ""MINCE"" but E excluded and I excluded? I is excluded. ""DANCE"" A and E excluded. Not good.

C at 5: ""? ? ? ? C"", with N at 1,2, or 3.

If N at 1: ""N ? ? ? C"", e.g., ""NIGHT"" no C. ""NOVEL"" O and E excluded.

If N at 2: ""? N ? ? C"", e.g., ""UNLIT"" no C. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""ONCET"" not word.

If N at 3: ""? ? N ? C"", e.g., ""BENCH"" E excluded. ""PINCH"" I excluded. ""LUNCH"" has C at 4, not 5.

""LUNCH"" has C at 4. To have C at 5, we need words like ""PUNCH"" same as above? ""PUNCH"" is P,U,N,C,H — C at 4.

What about ""CLANK""? C at 1? But C cannot be at 1. Not allowed.

""KNACK"" has double C? But C at 4 and 5? But we know C is present, but not necessarily double. And K at 1, N at 2, A at 3? A excluded.

Not good.

So back to ""BUNCH"" or ""LUNCH"" or ""PUNCH"".

In these, N is at position 3 and C at position 4.

We also have the possibility of C at position 3 and N at position 1 or 2.

For example, C at 3: then N at 1 or 2.

If N at 1: ""N ? C ? ?"", e.g., ""NICHE"" I excluded. ""NACHO"" A excluded. ""NECKS"" E excluded. Not many options.

If N at 2: ""? N C ? ?"", e.g., ""UNCLE"" E excluded. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""ONCET"" not word. ""ANCHO"" A excluded.

So it seems difficult to find words with C at 3 and N at 1 or 2 without using excluded letters.

Therefore, the most feasible are words with N at 3 and C at 4, like ""BUNCH"", ""LUNCH"", ""PUNCH"", ""HUNCH"", etc.

We can also consider C at 5? But we don't have a common word with C at 5 and N at 1,2,3 without excluded letters.

For example, ""TRUNC"" not a word. ""CLINK"" C at 1 not allowed.

""ZINC"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

So let's go with ""PUNCH"" or ""LUNCH"".

But we need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have to avoid S, I, O, R, A, E.

Available vowels: U and Y? And consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, etc.

In ""PUNCH"", we have P, U, N, C, H.

U is a vowel, which is good to test.

Similarly, in ""LUNCH"", L, U, N, C, H.

We don't know about U, P, L, H.

We can choose either.

But let's see if we can include T, which is very common.

For example, ""PUNCH"" doesn't have T. ""LUNCH"" doesn't.

What about ""HUNCH""? Same as above.

Or ""CLUNK""? C at 1 not allowed.

""FUNKY""? F,U,N,K,Y. But C is missing? We must include C.

We must include both C and N.

Another idea: ""NICHT"" not English.

""YUCKY"" no N or C? Not.

So I think ""PUNCH"" is a good candidate.

But let's confirm the positions: in ""PUNCH"", P at 1, U at 2, N at 3, C at 4, H at 5.

Now, for N: position 3 is new (previously tried at 4 and 5, both wrong). For C: position 4 is new (previously tried at 1 and 2, both wrong).

So we are testing new positions for both.

Also, we test P, U, H.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another word: ""MUNCH"" M,U,N,C,H.

Similarly.

I think ""PUNCH"" is fine.

But let's see if there is a word with T.

For example, ""NUTTY"" no C. ""CUTIN"" I excluded. ""CANTY"" A excluded.

Not easy.

""COUNT"" O excluded. ""JOINT"" O and I excluded? O and I are excluded.

So I think ""PUNCH"" is acceptable.

We'll go with ""PUNCH"".

But in the feedback, we might get information about U, P, H.

If U is not in the word, we know, etc.

So <guess>PUNCH</guess>

But let's write it.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - R, A, E are not in the word.  
  - N is in the word but not in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: SCION**  
  Feedback: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - S, I, O are not in the word.  
  - C is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - N is in the word but not in position 5.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters in the Word**:  
   - C and N must be present (both received ""-"" in feedback, indicating they are in the word but misplaced).  
   - C cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from CRANE and SCION feedback).  
   - N cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from CRANE and SCION feedback).  
   - Therefore, C must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - R, A, E (from CRANE), S, I, O (from SCION) are not in the word.  
   - Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and Y can act as a vowel).  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include C and N to test their valid positions (C: 3,4,5; N: 1,2,3).  
   - Avoid excluded letters (R, A, E, S, I, O).  
   - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, L, U, H, P) to gather more information.  
   - Prioritize words where C and N are placed in new untested positions to resolve ambiguity:  
     - C was previously in position 1 (CRANE) and 2 (SCION), so test position 3, 4, or 5.  
     - N was previously in position 4 (CRANE) and 5 (SCION), so test position 1, 2, or 3.  
   - Given the constraints, words like **PUNCH** (C at position 4, N at position 3) or **LUNCH** (same positions) are strong candidates. They use common letters (U, H, P/L) and fit the positional rules.  

**Chosen Guess: PUNCH**  
- **Why PUNCH?**  
  - Contains C (position 4) and N (position 3), both in new valid positions.  
  - Uses new letters: P (position 1), U (position 2), H (position 5) — all untested and common.  
  - Avoids excluded letters (R, A, E, S, I, O).  
  - If U is in the word, feedback will confirm it (and whether it's in position 2). Similarly, P and H will be tested.  
  - This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for C and N while probing new letters.

Similarly, N: try position 1,2,3,5.\n\nNow, can we put both in positions that are different? Also, we have 3 other letters to choose.\n\nLet me list some possible words.\n\nSince C cannot be in position1, and we know position1 is not C, and not R,A,E. But we don\'t know position1. It must be a letter that isn\'t C (but C is elsewhere), and not R,A,E.\n\nAlso, position1 cannot be the same as the letters excluded? All positions must not be R,A,E since they are not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, position3 is not A? But A is not in the word, so position3 cannot be A. Actually, no R,A,E anywhere.\n\nNow, we have to choose a word without R,A,E, with C and N, and not place C at position1 or N at position4.\n\nLet me try to think of words that start with different letters, since position1 is unknown.\n\nWe can try picking a word with S or T, which are common.\n\nFor example, let\'s try putting C at position 3 and N at position 2? Then the word would be ? N C ? ?\n\nPossible words: \n\n- Must include N and C.\n\nWhat if we try something like ""SONIC""? But S is new, O is vowel (but we don\'t know about O yet), N at position4? But we know N is not in position4 (from feedback: N was in position4 and got \'-\', meaning it is not correct there). So we cannot put N in position4 again? Actually, we can, but the feedback said N is in the word but not at position4, so if we put it again at position4, it would get \'-\' again. But it\'s inefficient. We should put N in a new position to test.\n\nSimilarly for C.\n\nSo we should avoid position4 for N and position1 for C.\n\nTherefore, ""SONIC"" has N at position4? No: S(1) O(2) N(3) I(4) C(5)? Wait, let me index: \nPosition: 1-S, 2-O, 3-N, 4-I, 5-C.\n\nBut N is at position3 (not position4), and C is at position5 (not position1). So that works? And it avoids R,A,E.\n\nBut let me check the letters: S,O,N,I,C. We don\'t have R,A,E, so okay.\n\nIs ""SONIC"" valid? Yes, it\'s a word.\n\nBut we also know from feedback that C is in the word but not position1 (which we knew), but in SONIC, C is at position5, so if the secret word has C at position5, it would get \'✓\'. If not, \'x\' or \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly, N is at position3.\n\nBut we want to test new positions.\n\nAnother option: words beginning with C? But C cannot be position1? Wait, feedback said C is not in position1, and since it\'s present but not position1, we shouldn\'t put it at position1 again. So position1 can be something else.\n\nWe can put position1 as a new letter, say S or T.\n\nWhat about ""SNICK""? S,N,I,C,K. But K is new.\n\n""SNICK"" has S at1, N at2, I at3, C at4, K at5. But N is at position2 (not 4), C at position4 (not 1). So positions: avoid position4 for N? Position4 here is C, not N. N is at2.\n\nN is at2 (which is new position compared to previous) and C at4 (which was position1 before? No, C was at1 now at position4).\n\nBut ""SNICK"" might be uncommon? Let\'s see if it\'s a word.\n\nSNICK: as in snick or snee? It might be acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s think of a word with C and N and common vowels. Vowels: We know no A, E. So vowels left: I,O,U,Y.\n\nWe can use O,I,U,Y as vowels.\n\nFor example, ""CLINT"": C,L,I,N,T? Positions:1-C,2-L,3-I,4-N,5-T. But C cannot be at position1? Because we have feedback that C is in the word but not position1. So if we put C at1, it would be incorrect. And since we know it\'s not position1, if we put it there, we lose information? Actually, the feedback would still say \'-\' if it\'s in the word but wrong position, but we know position1 is wrong for C, so it\'s wasteful to put it there again.\n\nSimilarly, ""CLINT"" has C at position1? So we\'d get \'-\' for C? And N at position4? But N was previously at position4 and got \'-\', meaning not position4. Now we\'re putting N at position4 again? Then it will also give \'-\'? And we don\'t test a new position for N.\n\nSo we should avoid putting C at position1 and N at position4.\n\nTherefore, ""CLINT"" is not good.\n\nAnother word: ""CONIC"": has O and I. Positions:1-C,2-O,3-N,4-I,5-C. Oh wait, two C\'s? But secret word might have double? Feedback didn\'t show double, but allowed? Wordle allows doubles? The rules didn\'t say not to.\n\nBut in feedback, each letter is considered? And ""CONIC"" has C at position1 and position5? But we know C is in the word but not position1, so putting at position1 might confuse? And at position5.\n\nBut let\'s see if the secret word has double letters? We don\'t know.\n\nBut for efficiency, we should avoid repeating letters if possible, since we don\'t know.\n\nAlso, C in position1 is not good because we already know position1 is not C.\n\nSo better to choose a word with C elsewhere.\n\nAlternative: ""PINCH"" P,I,N,C,H? Positions:1-P,2-I,3-N,4-C,5-H? Then N at position3 (not 4), C at position4 (not 1). So avoid position4 for N? Yes, position3 is new for N.\n\nBut also, we have new letters P,I,N,C,H. But N and C are known, P,I,H new.\n\nAlso, no vowels? I is vowel? Yes.\n\nBut we don\'t know about I.\n\nNow, let\'s consider how to cover more common letters.\n\nSince R is out, and E,A out, we have: S, T, L, I, O, U, M, P, D, etc.\n\nLet me think of a word: Maybe ""SCION""?: S,C,I,O,N. Positions:1-S,2-C,3-I,4-O,5-N. Then C at position2 (not position1, good), N at position5 (not position4, good). And letters are all distinct: S,C,I,O,N.\n\nAnd no R,A,E.\n\nAlso, S and T are very common, but T is not included? In this case, we test S, C, I, O, N.\n\nC and N are already known to be present. So we are retesting them? But in different positions, which is good to find the correct spots.\n\nMoreover, we test O and I? Which may or may not be present.\n\nThis seems decent.\n\nAnother possibility: ""MUNCH""? M,U,N,C,H? Has U and no I or O. But similarly.\n\n""SCION"" seems fine.\n\n""SONIC"": as I thought earlier: S(1) O(2) N(3) I(4) C(5). C at5 and N at3? Both new positions.\n\nIn SONIC: position1=S, position2=O, position3=N, position4=I, position5=C.\n\nCompared to SCION? SCION: S,C,I,O,N -> positions:1-S,2-C,3-I,4-O,5-N.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nIn SONIC, N is at position3 and C at position5.\n\nWe don\'t know which is better.\n\nBoth avoid known bad positions.\n\nBut in SCION, C is tried at position2 which is a new position and might be correct? Or not.\n\nSimilarly for SONIC: C at5 or N at3.\n\nEither is okay.\n\nBut let me see the frequency: position2 and position5 might be more common for certain letters? Not sure.\n\nAnother word: ""STOIC"": S,T,O,I,C? Positions:1-S,2-T,3-O,4-I,5-C. Then only C at position5? And N is missing? Oh N! We know N must be in the word, so our next guess must include N? Because we have to use that information.\n\nYes, important: since we know N is present, we should include it to narrow down its position.\n\nSimilarly for C, but C is harder to place? But we have to include C too.\n\nIn STOIC, it has C but no N? So we wouldn\'t be including N, which is bad? Because we know N is in the word, if we don\'t put N, we get zero information about its position? We might get \'x\' for N if we dont put it? But it will appear as not tested.\n\nFor efficiency, we should include both known present letters: C and N.\n\nSo words without C or without N are wasteful.\n\nTherefore, pin point: must include C and N, must exclude R, A, E.\n\nSo back to SCION or SONIC.\n\nSCION: S-C-I-O-N, positions: S1, C2, I3, O4, N5.\n\nSONIC: S1, O2, N3, I4, C5.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SCION"" because it tests C in position2 which is common? And S at position1.\n\nAlso, SCION is a word meaning a descendant.\n\nAfter this, we can get feedback on where C and N are, plus the letters S,I,O.\n\nSo <guess>SCION</guess>\n\nBut let\'s double-check the previous feedback: we had CRANE -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x). So secret word must have C and N, no R,A,E.\n\nSCION: S,C,I,O,N - all valid letters? S: new, C: known, I: new, O: new, N: known.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps ""MINCE""? M,I,N,C,E? E is forbidden? We know E is not in word? So MINCE has E? So invalid? E is excluded.\n\nTherefore, SCION and SONIC avoid excluded letters.\n\nI think SCION is a good guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C is in the word but not in position 1.\n- R is not in the word.\n- A is not in the word.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E is not in the word.\n\nTherefore:\n- The secret word contains C and N, excludes R, A, and E.\n- C must be in a position other than 1 (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).\n- N must be in a position other than 4 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n- The next guess must include C and N, exclude R, A, and E, and test new letters to maximize information.\n\nFor the second guess, ""SCION"" is chosen because:\n- It includes both C and N (C at position 2, N at position 5—both are new positions since C’s previous position was 1 and N’s was 4).\n- It excludes R, A, and E.\n- It tests new letters (S at position 1, I at position 3, O at position 4), covering high-frequency consonants and vowels.\n- The word is valid (5-letter English word) and helps probe potential positions for C and N while gathering data on S, I, and O.\n\n<guess>SCION</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SCION -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: CRANE\n- C: \'-\' → present but wrong position (not position 1)\n- R: \'x\' → not in word\n- A: \'x\' → not in word\n- N: \'-\' → present but wrong position (not position 4)\n- E: \'x\' → not in word\n\nSecond guess: SCION\n- S: \'x\' → not in word\n- C: \'-\' → present but wrong position (not position 2, because in SCION, C is at position 2)\n- I: \'x\' → not in word\n- O: \'x\' → not in word\n- N: \'-\' → present but wrong position (not position 5, because in SCION, N is at position 5)\n\nWhat we know so far:\n- The secret word contains C and N (from both guesses).\n- The secret word does not contain R, A, E, S, I, O (all marked \'x\' in at least one guess).\n- C is not in position 1 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from SCION). So C must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n- N is not in position 4 (from CRANE) and not in position 5 (from SCION). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions. We have constraints on C and N.\n\nAlso, since C and N are both present, and we have positions to assign.\n\nNow, the word cannot have R, A, E, S, I, O. So available letters are from the remaining alphabet.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we need to form a 5-letter word with C and N, and three other letters from the above, excluding the forbidden ones.\n\nMoreover, we know the positions where C and N cannot be.\n\nLet\'s list possible positions for C: 3,4,5\nFor N: 1,2,3\n\nBut note: if N is in position 3, then C cannot be in position 3? Well, they could be the same? But no, because if both are in position 3, that would be the same letter? But C and N are different. So they can share a position? No, each position has one letter. So if N is in position 3, then C cannot be in position 3. Similarly, if C is in position 3, N cannot be.\n\nSo possible cases:\n\nCase 1: N in position 1, then C in 3,4, or 5\nCase 2: N in position 2, then C in 3,4, or 5\nCase 3: N in position 3, then C in 4 or 5 (since 3 is taken by N)\n\nSimilarly, if C is in 3, then N can be in 1 or 2 (not 3)\nIf C in 4, N in 1,2,3\nIf C in 5, N in 1,2,3\n\nBut we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong.\n\nNow, we need to choose a word that includes C and N, and three new letters, and places C and N in the possible positions to test.\n\nWe also want to test common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon letters left: T, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.\n\nWe should avoid using letters that are already excluded: R, A, E, S, I, O.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have C and N, and use common letters.\n\nFor example, words like ""CLUNK"", ""CHUNK"", ""FUNKY"", but F and K are less common? Or ""PUNCH"", ""LUNCH"", ""BUNCH"", etc.\n\nBut we have to consider the position constraints.\n\nAlso, we know C cannot be in 1 or 2, so C must be in 3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, N cannot be in 4 or 5, so N must be in 1,2,3.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word with N in position 1 or 2, and C in 3,4, or 5.\n\nFor instance:\n- If N is at 1: then the word starts with N. Then C at 3,4, or 5.\n  - Examples: ""N"" _ _ _ _ \n    - With C at 3: ""N?C??"", e.g., ""NICHE"" but I is excluded, so not. ""NACHO"" but A excluded. So need letters from available set.\n    - Available: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,P,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n    - ""N"" at 1, then position 2: say U (vowel?), position 3: C? Then ""NUC??"" -> ""NUCLE"" but E excluded. ""NUKED"" E excluded. Not many common words.\n    - ""N"" at 1, C at 4: ""N? ? C ?"", e.g., ""NIGHT"" but no C? ""NICHT"" not English. ""NATCH"" A excluded. Hard.\n\n- N at 2: then the word has second letter N. C at 3,4,5.\n  - Pattern: _ N _ _ _\n  - With C at 3: _ N C _ _ , e.g., ""UNCLO"" but O excluded. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""UNCLE"" E excluded. ""UNCUT"" U and T? ""UNCUT"" has U,C,T. But C is at position 3? Let\'s see: U(1), N(2), C(3), U(4)? No, ""UNCUT"" is U, N, C, U, T? Positions: 1-U, 2-N, 3-C, 4-U, 5-T. But U repeated? And we don\'t know if U is allowed? We haven\'t tested U.\n\nBut U is not excluded yet, so it could be.\n\nSimilarly, ""UNCLY"" not a word.\n\n""BUNCH"": B(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5). But in this case, N is at position 3? And C at position 4.\n\nBut we have constraints: N must be in 1,2,3. Here N at 3 is allowed? Yes, because we only know N not at 4 or 5. Similarly, C at 4 is allowed? C can be at 4? Yes, since C not at 1 or 2.\n\nIn ""BUNCH"": \n- Position 1: B\n- Position 2: U\n- Position 3: N\n- Position 4: C\n- Position 5: H\n\nNow, N is at 3, which is a possible position. C is at 4, which is also possible.\n\nAnd letters: B, U, N, C, H. All not excluded? B, U, H are new, N and C known.\n\nBut we have to check if U is allowed? We haven\'t had feedback on U, so it could be in the word or not.\n\nSimilarly, B and H.\n\nAlso, ""BUNCH"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother possibility: ""LUNCH"" L(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) — similar.\n\nOr ""PUNCH"" P(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5)\n\nNow, what about N at 3 and C at 5? For example, ""MINCE"" but E excluded and I excluded? I is excluded. ""DANCE"" A and E excluded. Not good.\n\nC at 5: ""? ? ? ? C"", with N at 1,2, or 3.\n\nIf N at 1: ""N ? ? ? C"", e.g., ""NIGHT"" no C. ""NOVEL"" O and E excluded.\n\nIf N at 2: ""? N ? ? C"", e.g., ""UNLIT"" no C. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""ONCET"" not word.\n\nIf N at 3: ""? ? N ? C"", e.g., ""BENCH"" E excluded. ""PINCH"" I excluded. ""LUNCH"" has C at 4, not 5.\n\n""LUNCH"" has C at 4. To have C at 5, we need words like ""PUNCH"" same as above? ""PUNCH"" is P,U,N,C,H — C at 4.\n\nWhat about ""CLANK""? C at 1? But C cannot be at 1. Not allowed.\n\n""KNACK"" has double C? But C at 4 and 5? But we know C is present, but not necessarily double. And K at 1, N at 2, A at 3? A excluded.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo back to ""BUNCH"" or ""LUNCH"" or ""PUNCH"".\n\nIn these, N is at position 3 and C at position 4.\n\nWe also have the possibility of C at position 3 and N at position 1 or 2.\n\nFor example, C at 3: then N at 1 or 2.\n\nIf N at 1: ""N ? C ? ?"", e.g., ""NICHE"" I excluded. ""NACHO"" A excluded. ""NECKS"" E excluded. Not many options.\n\nIf N at 2: ""? N C ? ?"", e.g., ""UNCLE"" E excluded. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""ONCET"" not word. ""ANCHO"" A excluded.\n\nSo it seems difficult to find words with C at 3 and N at 1 or 2 without using excluded letters.\n\nTherefore, the most feasible are words with N at 3 and C at 4, like ""BUNCH"", ""LUNCH"", ""PUNCH"", ""HUNCH"", etc.\n\nWe can also consider C at 5? But we don\'t have a common word with C at 5 and N at 1,2,3 without excluded letters.\n\nFor example, ""TRUNC"" not a word. ""CLINK"" C at 1 not allowed.\n\n""ZINC"" is 4 letters? Not 5.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""PUNCH"" or ""LUNCH"".\n\nBut we need to choose one that tests new letters.\n\nWe have to avoid S, I, O, R, A, E.\n\nAvailable vowels: U and Y? And consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, etc.\n\nIn ""PUNCH"", we have P, U, N, C, H.\n\nU is a vowel, which is good to test.\n\nSimilarly, in ""LUNCH"", L, U, N, C, H.\n\nWe don\'t know about U, P, L, H.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can include T, which is very common.\n\nFor example, ""PUNCH"" doesn\'t have T. ""LUNCH"" doesn\'t.\n\nWhat about ""HUNCH""? Same as above.\n\nOr ""CLUNK""? C at 1 not allowed.\n\n""FUNKY""? F,U,N,K,Y. But C is missing? We must include C.\n\nWe must include both C and N.\n\nAnother idea: ""NICHT"" not English.\n\n""YUCKY"" no N or C? Not.\n\nSo I think ""PUNCH"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the positions: in ""PUNCH"", P at 1, U at 2, N at 3, C at 4, H at 5.\n\nNow, for N: position 3 is new (previously tried at 4 and 5, both wrong). For C: position 4 is new (previously tried at 1 and 2, both wrong).\n\nSo we are testing new positions for both.\n\nAlso, we test P, U, H.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAnother word: ""MUNCH"" M,U,N,C,H.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think ""PUNCH"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with T.\n\nFor example, ""NUTTY"" no C. ""CUTIN"" I excluded. ""CANTY"" A excluded.\n\nNot easy.\n\n""COUNT"" O excluded. ""JOINT"" O and I excluded? O and I are excluded.\n\nSo I think ""PUNCH"" is acceptable.\n\nWe\'ll go with ""PUNCH"".\n\nBut in the feedback, we might get information about U, P, H.\n\nIf U is not in the word, we know, etc.\n\nSo <guess>PUNCH</guess>\n\nBut let\'s write it.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE**  \n  Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  \n  - R, A, E are not in the word.  \n  - N is in the word but not in position 4.  \n\n- **Guess 2: SCION**  \n  Feedback: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - S, I, O are not in the word.  \n  - C is in the word but not in position 2.  \n  - N is in the word but not in position 5.  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **Confirmed Letters in the Word**:  \n   - C and N must be present (both received ""-"" in feedback, indicating they are in the word but misplaced).  \n   - C cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from CRANE and SCION feedback).  \n   - N cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from CRANE and SCION feedback).  \n   - Therefore, C must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  \n\n2. **Excluded Letters**:  \n   - R, A, E (from CRANE), S, I, O (from SCION) are not in the word.  \n   - Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and Y can act as a vowel).  \n\n3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  \n   - Must include C and N to test their valid positions (C: 3,4,5; N: 1,2,3).  \n   - Avoid excluded letters (R, A, E, S, I, O).  \n   - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, L, U, H, P) to gather more information.  \n   - Prioritize words where C and N are placed in new untested positions to resolve ambiguity:  \n     - C was previously in position 1 (CRANE) and 2 (SCION), so test position 3, 4, or 5.  \n     - N was previously in position 4 (CRANE) and 5 (SCION), so test position 1, 2, or 3.  \n   - Given the constraints, words like **PUNCH** (C at position 4, N at position 3) or **LUNCH** (same positions) are strong candidates. They use common letters (U, H, P/L) and fit the positional rules.  \n\n**Chosen Guess: PUNCH**  \n- **Why PUNCH?**  \n  - Contains C (position 4) and N (position 3), both in new valid positions.  \n  - Uses new letters: P (position 1), U (position 2), H (position 5) — all untested and common.  \n  - Avoids excluded letters (R, A, E, S, I, O).  \n  - If U is in the word, feedback will confirm it (and whether it\'s in position 2). Similarly, P and H will be tested.  \n  - This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for C and N while probing new letters.\n\n<guess>PUNCH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SCION -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)\nGuess 3: PUNCH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) N(✓) C(✓) H(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from Guess 3: PUNCH -> P(x) U(✓) N(✓) C(✓) H(✓)
This means:
- P is not in the word (x)
- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since in PUNCH, U is the second letter)
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in PUNCH, N is the third letter)
- C is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since in PUNCH, C is the fourth letter)
- H is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since in PUNCH, H is the fifth letter)

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word has the form: ? U N C H
- The first letter is unknown, but it cannot be P (since P is not in the word), and also cannot be any previously excluded letters: R, A, E, S, I, O (from previous feedback).

Moreover, we know the word must be ? U N C H, and the first letter must be a letter that hasn't been excluded and is not U, N, C, H (since those are already placed and we don't have information about duplicates, but typically we assume no duplicates unless indicated, but we should be cautious).

But note: the feedback for U, N, C, H are all correct (✓), meaning they are in the right positions. So the word ends with ""UNCH"" and the first letter is missing.

Now, what letters are possible for the first position?
Excluded letters so far: R, A, E, S, I, O, P (from the x's in all guesses).

So excluded: R, A, E, S, I, O, P.

We also know from the word structure, the first letter cannot be U, N, C, H because:
- U is at position 2, so if the first letter were U, it would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate so far, and the rules don't forbid it, but we should consider the possibility.

But in the previous feedback, when we had CRANE and SCION, we didn't have any duplicates, and the feedback didn't indicate duplicates. So it's possible, but to be safe, we can first assume no duplicates and then adjust if needed.

Given that, the first letter must be a letter not in {U, N, C, H} and not in the excluded list.

Excluded: R, A, E, S, I, O, P.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, and possibly others.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word of the form ? U N C H.

What are possible English words?
- BUNCH: but we already guessed PUNCH, and B is available? BUNCH is a word, but we know P is not in the word, and BUNCH has B at first.
- Similarly, HUNCH: but H is at position 5, so if we put H at first, it would be duplicate? But H is already at position 5, so if the word has two H's? But in BUNCH, no H at first? HUNCH would be H U N C H, so H at position 1 and 5? That's possible.

But let's list common words ending with ""UNCH"":
- BUNCH
- HUNCH
- LUNCH (but L is available? We haven't excluded L)
- MUNCH
- DUNCH? Not common.
- GUNCH? Not common.

We already know PUNCH is not the word because P is excluded and we got P(x) in feedback.

So possible words: BUNCH, HUNCH, LUNCH, MUNCH.

But we have to check if the first letter is excluded or not.

Excluded letters: R, A, E, S, I, O, P.

So:
- BUNCH: B is not excluded -> possible.
- HUNCH: H is already in the word at position 5. If the word allows duplicates, it's possible. But we don't know. However, in the feedback for PUNCH, we had H(✓) at position 5, but if H were also at position 1, we would have seen a '-' for H in position 1 if we had guessed it? But we didn't. So we cannot rule out duplicates. But in this case, for HUNCH, we have H at 1 and 5. Similarly, for MUNCH, M is not excluded.

But we have to make a guess that is a valid word.

We can guess one of these to solve the puzzle.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and this is guess 4. We can try to guess the word directly if we think we have enough information.

Possible words: BUNCH, HUNCH, LUNCH, MUNCH.

We haven't tested B, L, M, etc.

But we can choose one that uses a common letter or just pick one.

Since we have U, N, C, H fixed, and only the first letter unknown, we can try to guess.

But we must make a valid guess.

Let's see which of these are valid:

- BUNCH: valid
- HUNCH: valid
- LUNCH: valid
- MUNCH: valid

We don't know which one it is.

But we have to make a guess.

We can use a guess that includes a new letter to confirm, but since we are at the fourth guess, and we have only one letter missing, it's efficient to guess one of these.

But if we guess wrong, we lose a try, but we have two more tries.

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested any of B, L, M? No, so we don't know if they are in the word or not.

But in this case, the word is ?UNCH, so the first letter is the only unknown, and it must be one of these.

We can guess ""BUNCH"" to test B.

If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that B is not in the word, then we can try another.

Similarly for others.

But we have to choose one.

Since we have no information about B, L, M, we can start with the most common one.

""LUNCH"" is very common.

But let's see the frequency.

We can also consider that in the first position, we have constraints from common words.

But I think it's safe to guess one.

To be strategic, we can choose a word that tests a letter that might be used in other positions, but here the positions are fixed.

Another idea: we can guess a word that is not necessarily ?UNCH but that includes other letters to test? But that would be inefficient because we know 4 letters are fixed and correct.

For example, if we guess ""LAUGH"", but that doesn't have N,C,H in the right places? No, we know U,N,C,H are fixed in positions 2,3,4,5.

So we must have ? U N C H.

So we cannot change that.

Therefore, we must guess a word of that form.

So I think we should guess ""LUNCH"" because L is a common starting letter.

But let's list the possibilities:

1. BUNCH
2. HUNCH
3. LUNCH
4. MUNCH

We can also consider ""DUNCH"" but it's not common, or ""GUNCH"", not common.

So likely one of these four.

Now, we have excluded P, so PUNCH is out.

We haven't excluded B, H, L, M.

But H is already in the word at position 5. If we guess HUNCH, it has H at position 1 and 5. Is that allowed? The rules don't forbid duplicate letters, so it is possible.

Similarly, for others, no duplicates.

In the feedback, when we guessed PUNCH, we had H(✓) at position 5, but we didn't have any indication about position 1. So if the word is HUNCH, then H is at position 1 and 5, but when we guessed PUNCH, we only had H at position 5, so it was correct, and we didn't have a H at position 1 in the guess, so we didn't get feedback on that. So it's possible.

Similarly, for other words.

To decide, we can think about which one is more likely, but we don't have frequency data.

We can use the fact that we haven't seen any duplicate so far, so perhaps duplicates are less likely? But we don't know.

To minimize risk, we can guess a word without duplicate first, like LUNCH or BUNCH or MUNCH.

Let's pick ""LUNCH"" as it is a very common word.

So <guess>LUNCH</guess>

But if it's wrong, we get feedback and then we can guess again.

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested L? No, so if we guess LUNCH and it's wrong, we know L is not in the word, then we can try MUNCH or BUNCH.

Similarly.

I think it's fine.

So I'll go with LUNCH.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C and N are in the word but not in positions 1 or 4, respectively.  
  - R, A, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: SCION**  
  Feedback: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C and N are in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, respectively.  
  - S, I, O are not in the word.  

- **Guess 3: PUNCH**  
  Feedback: P(x) U(✓) N(✓) C(✓) H(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - U, N, C, H are in the word and in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, 4, 5).  
  - P is not in the word.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Secret Word Structure**:  
   - The feedback for PUNCH confirms that the secret word has the form `? U N C H` (where `?` is the unknown first letter).  
   - U is fixed at position 2, N at 3, C at 4, and H at 5.  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - From all feedback: R, A, E, S, I, O, P are not in the word.  
   - Available letters for position 1: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (since U, N, C, H are already placed and duplicates are possible but unconfirmed).  

3. **Possible Words**:  
   - Common English words fitting `? U N C H`:  
     - **BUNCH**: B at position 1.  
     - **HUNCH**: H at position 1 (duplicate of position 5 H).  
     - **LUNCH**: L at position 1.  
     - **MUNCH**: M at position 1.  
   - Less common options (e.g., DUNCH, GUNCH) are possible but lower probability.  

4. **Strategy for Guess 4**:  
   - Since 4 letters are confirmed and positioned, the goal is to test the first letter with a valid word.  
   - Prioritize high-frequency options: LUNCH is a common word and tests L (untested letter).  
   - If incorrect, feedback on L will resolve the remaining possibilities (e.g., if L is excluded, try BUNCH or MUNCH next).  

**Chosen Guess: LUNCH**  
- **Why LUNCH?**  
  - Fits the `? U N C H` structure with L in position 1.  
  - Tests L, a new high-frequency consonant not yet evaluated.  
  - Avoids excluded letters and minimizes risk of duplicates (unlike HUNCH).  
  - If correct, the game is solved. If not, feedback on L will narrow options to BUNCH, MUNCH, or HUNCH for the next guess.  

<guess>LUNCH</guess>",LUNCH,"We have feedback from Guess 3: PUNCH -> P(x) U(✓) N(✓) C(✓) H(✓)
This means:
- P is not in the word (x)
- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since in PUNCH, U is the second letter)
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in PUNCH, N is the third letter)
- C is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since in PUNCH, C is the fourth letter)
- H is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since in PUNCH, H is the fifth letter)

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word has the form: ? U N C H
- The first letter is unknown, but it cannot be P (since P is not in the word), and also cannot be any previously excluded letters: R, A, E, S, I, O (from previous feedback).

Moreover, we know the word must be ? U N C H, and the first letter must be a letter that hasn't been excluded and is not U, N, C, H (since those are already placed and we don't have information about duplicates, but typically we assume no duplicates unless indicated, but we should be cautious).

But note: the feedback for U, N, C, H are all correct (✓), meaning they are in the right positions. So the word ends with ""UNCH"" and the first letter is missing.

Now, what letters are possible for the first position?
Excluded letters so far: R, A, E, S, I, O, P (from the x's in all guesses).

So excluded: R, A, E, S, I, O, P.

We also know from the word structure, the first letter cannot be U, N, C, H because:
- U is at position 2, so if the first letter were U, it would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate so far, and the rules don't forbid it, but we should consider the possibility.

But in the previous feedback, when we had CRANE and SCION, we didn't have any duplicates, and the feedback didn't indicate duplicates. So it's possible, but to be safe, we can first assume no duplicates and then adjust if needed.

Given that, the first letter must be a letter not in {U, N, C, H} and not in the excluded list.

Excluded: R, A, E, S, I, O, P.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, and possibly others.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word of the form ? U N C H.

What are possible English words?
- BUNCH: but we already guessed PUNCH, and B is available? BUNCH is a word, but we know P is not in the word, and BUNCH has B at first.
- Similarly, HUNCH: but H is at position 5, so if we put H at first, it would be duplicate? But H is already at position 5, so if the word has two H's? But in BUNCH, no H at first? HUNCH would be H U N C H, so H at position 1 and 5? That's possible.

But let's list common words ending with ""UNCH"":
- BUNCH
- HUNCH
- LUNCH (but L is available? We haven't excluded L)
- MUNCH
- DUNCH? Not common.
- GUNCH? Not common.

We already know PUNCH is not the word because P is excluded and we got P(x) in feedback.

So possible words: BUNCH, HUNCH, LUNCH, MUNCH.

But we have to check if the first letter is excluded or not.

Excluded letters: R, A, E, S, I, O, P.

So:
- BUNCH: B is not excluded -> possible.
- HUNCH: H is already in the word at position 5. If the word allows duplicates, it's possible. But we don't know. However, in the feedback for PUNCH, we had H(✓) at position 5, but if H were also at position 1, we would have seen a '-' for H in position 1 if we had guessed it? But we didn't. So we cannot rule out duplicates. But in this case, for HUNCH, we have H at 1 and 5. Similarly, for MUNCH, M is not excluded.

But we have to make a guess that is a valid word.

We can guess one of these to solve the puzzle.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and this is guess 4. We can try to guess the word directly if we think we have enough information.

Possible words: BUNCH, HUNCH, LUNCH, MUNCH.

We haven't tested B, L, M, etc.

But we can choose one that uses a common letter or just pick one.

Since we have U, N, C, H fixed, and only the first letter unknown, we can try to guess.

But we must make a valid guess.

Let's see which of these are valid:

- BUNCH: valid
- HUNCH: valid
- LUNCH: valid
- MUNCH: valid

We don't know which one it is.

But we have to make a guess.

We can use a guess that includes a new letter to confirm, but since we are at the fourth guess, and we have only one letter missing, it's efficient to guess one of these.

But if we guess wrong, we lose a try, but we have two more tries.

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested any of B, L, M? No, so we don't know if they are in the word or not.

But in this case, the word is ?UNCH, so the first letter is the only unknown, and it must be one of these.

We can guess ""BUNCH"" to test B.

If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that B is not in the word, then we can try another.

Similarly for others.

But we have to choose one.

Since we have no information about B, L, M, we can start with the most common one.

""LUNCH"" is very common.

But let's see the frequency.

We can also consider that in the first position, we have constraints from common words.

But I think it's safe to guess one.

To be strategic, we can choose a word that tests a letter that might be used in other positions, but here the positions are fixed.

Another idea: we can guess a word that is not necessarily ?UNCH but that includes other letters to test? But that would be inefficient because we know 4 letters are fixed and correct.

For example, if we guess ""LAUGH"", but that doesn't have N,C,H in the right places? No, we know U,N,C,H are fixed in positions 2,3,4,5.

So we must have ? U N C H.

So we cannot change that.

Therefore, we must guess a word of that form.

So I think we should guess ""LUNCH"" because L is a common starting letter.

But let's list the possibilities:

1. BUNCH
2. HUNCH
3. LUNCH
4. MUNCH

We can also consider ""DUNCH"" but it's not common, or ""GUNCH"", not common.

So likely one of these four.

Now, we have excluded P, so PUNCH is out.

We haven't excluded B, H, L, M.

But H is already in the word at position 5. If we guess HUNCH, it has H at position 1 and 5. Is that allowed? The rules don't forbid duplicate letters, so it is possible.

Similarly, for others, no duplicates.

In the feedback, when we guessed PUNCH, we had H(✓) at position 5, but we didn't have any indication about position 1. So if the word is HUNCH, then H is at position 1 and 5, but when we guessed PUNCH, we only had H at position 5, so it was correct, and we didn't have a H at position 1 in the guess, so we didn't get feedback on that. So it's possible.

Similarly, for other words.

To decide, we can think about which one is more likely, but we don't have frequency data.

We can use the fact that we haven't seen any duplicate so far, so perhaps duplicates are less likely? But we don't know.

To minimize risk, we can guess a word without duplicate first, like LUNCH or BUNCH or MUNCH.

Let's pick ""LUNCH"" as it is a very common word.

So <guess>LUNCH</guess>

But if it's wrong, we get feedback and then we can guess again.

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested L? No, so if we guess LUNCH and it's wrong, we know L is not in the word, then we can try MUNCH or BUNCH.

Similarly.

I think it's fine.

So I'll go with LUNCH.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make our first guess. Since we have no prior feedback, we should choose a word that can give us maximum information. Typically, words with common letters and minimal repeating letters are chosen.

I recall that in Wordle, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"" are often recommended as starting words because they contain a mix of common consonants and vowels.

One crucial point: The game expects a valid English word. We cannot use non-English words.

I will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and a combination of vowels and consonants.

Let me pick ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It has C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is also a very good starting word because it has two vowels and three consonants, including R, S which are common.

But I remember that ""SLATE"" is often used. 

However, I don't think the exact word matters too much as long as it's balanced. Let me go with ""RAISE"" because it covers A, I (vowels) and R, S, E (which is both vowel and consonant, but E is common).

Another popular one is ""ADIEU"" which has many vowels, but it might not be the best because we get fewer consonants? 

Let me decide: I will use ""CRANE"".

So, my first guess is: CRANE

But note: the example in the instructions used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". So I should avoid using any of these? Actually, we can use any word.

I'll go with ""CRANE"".

After making the guess, we'll get feedback and then we can use that to make the next guess.

But for now, we are only making the first guess.

So, let's output: <guess>CRANE</guess>

Wait, but the format should be exactly: <guess> guessed-word </guess>

So, I will return <guess>CRANE</guess>To start the game, I need to make an initial 5-letter word guess with no prior feedback. My goal is to maximize information by choosing a word with common letters and a mix of vowels/consonants. A strong opening word should:
- Cover frequent letters (e.g., E, A, R, S, T).
- Avoid repeated letters.
- Include vowels to help narrow down possibilities.

I selected **""CRANE""** because:
- It uses five distinct letters.
- Contains three vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N)—note that E is a vowel here.
- Features high-frequency letters (E, R, A), which appear in many English words.
- This word will provide feedback on common characters, helping eliminate large groups for subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess:
- C: '-' meaning C is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 1)
- R: 'x' meaning R is not in the secret word at all
- A: 'x' meaning A is not in the secret word
- N: '-' meaning N is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in CRANE)
- E: 'x' meaning E is not in the secret word

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters C and N, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- The secret word does NOT contain R, A, or E.

Also, since C and N are present, but not in their guessed positions, we can deduce:
- C must appear in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not position 1).
- N must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not position 4).

Moreover, we know the secret word has no R, A, E.

Now, for our second guess:
- We must include C and N (since they are in the word).
- We should exclude R, A, E.
- We need to try to put C and N in positions where they might be correct, and also include new letters to test.

Constraints on positions for C and N:
- C cannot be in position 1 again. Possible positions: 2,3,4,5.
- N cannot be in position 4 again. Possible positions:1,2,3,5.

We also want to test other common letters (since R,A,E are out) that might be in the word. Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

Let's think of a word that:
- Contains C and N.
- Does not contain R,A,E.
- Places C in one of positions 2,3,4,5 and N in a position not 4 (i.e., 1,2,3,5).

To maximize information, we can try to put C and N in positions they haven't been tried yet, and also test new positions.

In our first guess:
- C was in position 1
- N was in position 4

So for C: we can try position 2,3,4 or5. Similarly, N: try position 1,2,3,5.

Now, can we put both in positions that are different? Also, we have 3 other letters to choose.

Let me list some possible words.

Since C cannot be in position1, and we know position1 is not C, and not R,A,E. But we don't know position1. It must be a letter that isn't C (but C is elsewhere), and not R,A,E.

Also, position1 cannot be the same as the letters excluded? All positions must not be R,A,E since they are not in the word.

Similarly, position3 is not A? But A is not in the word, so position3 cannot be A. Actually, no R,A,E anywhere.

Now, we have to choose a word without R,A,E, with C and N, and not place C at position1 or N at position4.

Let me try to think of words that start with different letters, since position1 is unknown.

We can try picking a word with S or T, which are common.

For example, let's try putting C at position 3 and N at position 2? Then the word would be ? N C ? ?

Possible words: 

- Must include N and C.

What if we try something like ""SONIC""? But S is new, O is vowel (but we don't know about O yet), N at position4? But we know N is not in position4 (from feedback: N was in position4 and got '-', meaning it is not correct there). So we cannot put N in position4 again? Actually, we can, but the feedback said N is in the word but not at position4, so if we put it again at position4, it would get '-' again. But it's inefficient. We should put N in a new position to test.

Similarly for C.

So we should avoid position4 for N and position1 for C.

Therefore, ""SONIC"" has N at position4? No: S(1) O(2) N(3) I(4) C(5)? Wait, let me index: 
Position: 1-S, 2-O, 3-N, 4-I, 5-C.

But N is at position3 (not position4), and C is at position5 (not position1). So that works? And it avoids R,A,E.

But let me check the letters: S,O,N,I,C. We don't have R,A,E, so okay.

Is ""SONIC"" valid? Yes, it's a word.

But we also know from feedback that C is in the word but not position1 (which we knew), but in SONIC, C is at position5, so if the secret word has C at position5, it would get '✓'. If not, 'x' or '-'.

Similarly, N is at position3.

But we want to test new positions.

Another option: words beginning with C? But C cannot be position1? Wait, feedback said C is not in position1, and since it's present but not position1, we shouldn't put it at position1 again. So position1 can be something else.

We can put position1 as a new letter, say S or T.

What about ""SNICK""? S,N,I,C,K. But K is new.

""SNICK"" has S at1, N at2, I at3, C at4, K at5. But N is at position2 (not 4), C at position4 (not 1). So positions: avoid position4 for N? Position4 here is C, not N. N is at2.

N is at2 (which is new position compared to previous) and C at4 (which was position1 before? No, C was at1 now at position4).

But ""SNICK"" might be uncommon? Let's see if it's a word.

SNICK: as in snick or snee? It might be acceptable.

But let's think of a word with C and N and common vowels. Vowels: We know no A, E. So vowels left: I,O,U,Y.

We can use O,I,U,Y as vowels.

For example, ""CLINT"": C,L,I,N,T? Positions:1-C,2-L,3-I,4-N,5-T. But C cannot be at position1? Because we have feedback that C is in the word but not position1. So if we put C at1, it would be incorrect. And since we know it's not position1, if we put it there, we lose information? Actually, the feedback would still say '-' if it's in the word but wrong position, but we know position1 is wrong for C, so it's wasteful to put it there again.

Similarly, ""CLINT"" has C at position1? So we'd get '-' for C? And N at position4? But N was previously at position4 and got '-', meaning not position4. Now we're putting N at position4 again? Then it will also give '-'? And we don't test a new position for N.

So we should avoid putting C at position1 and N at position4.

Therefore, ""CLINT"" is not good.

Another word: ""CONIC"": has O and I. Positions:1-C,2-O,3-N,4-I,5-C. Oh wait, two C's? But secret word might have double? Feedback didn't show double, but allowed? Wordle allows doubles? The rules didn't say not to.

But in feedback, each letter is considered? And ""CONIC"" has C at position1 and position5? But we know C is in the word but not position1, so putting at position1 might confuse? And at position5.

But let's see if the secret word has double letters? We don't know.

But for efficiency, we should avoid repeating letters if possible, since we don't know.

Also, C in position1 is not good because we already know position1 is not C.

So better to choose a word with C elsewhere.

Alternative: ""PINCH"" P,I,N,C,H? Positions:1-P,2-I,3-N,4-C,5-H? Then N at position3 (not 4), C at position4 (not 1). So avoid position4 for N? Yes, position3 is new for N.

But also, we have new letters P,I,N,C,H. But N and C are known, P,I,H new.

Also, no vowels? I is vowel? Yes.

But we don't know about I.

Now, let's consider how to cover more common letters.

Since R is out, and E,A out, we have: S, T, L, I, O, U, M, P, D, etc.

Let me think of a word: Maybe ""SCION""?: S,C,I,O,N. Positions:1-S,2-C,3-I,4-O,5-N. Then C at position2 (not position1, good), N at position5 (not position4, good). And letters are all distinct: S,C,I,O,N.

And no R,A,E.

Also, S and T are very common, but T is not included? In this case, we test S, C, I, O, N.

C and N are already known to be present. So we are retesting them? But in different positions, which is good to find the correct spots.

Moreover, we test O and I? Which may or may not be present.

This seems decent.

Another possibility: ""MUNCH""? M,U,N,C,H? Has U and no I or O. But similarly.

""SCION"" seems fine.

""SONIC"": as I thought earlier: S(1) O(2) N(3) I(4) C(5). C at5 and N at3? Both new positions.

In SONIC: position1=S, position2=O, position3=N, position4=I, position5=C.

Compared to SCION? SCION: S,C,I,O,N -> positions:1-S,2-C,3-I,4-O,5-N.

Which is better?

In SONIC, N is at position3 and C at position5.

We don't know which is better.

Both avoid known bad positions.

But in SCION, C is tried at position2 which is a new position and might be correct? Or not.

Similarly for SONIC: C at5 or N at3.

Either is okay.

But let me see the frequency: position2 and position5 might be more common for certain letters? Not sure.

Another word: ""STOIC"": S,T,O,I,C? Positions:1-S,2-T,3-O,4-I,5-C. Then only C at position5? And N is missing? Oh N! We know N must be in the word, so our next guess must include N? Because we have to use that information.

Yes, important: since we know N is present, we should include it to narrow down its position.

Similarly for C, but C is harder to place? But we have to include C too.

In STOIC, it has C but no N? So we wouldn't be including N, which is bad? Because we know N is in the word, if we don't put N, we get zero information about its position? We might get 'x' for N if we dont put it? But it will appear as not tested.

For efficiency, we should include both known present letters: C and N.

So words without C or without N are wasteful.

Therefore, pin point: must include C and N, must exclude R, A, E.

So back to SCION or SONIC.

SCION: S-C-I-O-N, positions: S1, C2, I3, O4, N5.

SONIC: S1, O2, N3, I4, C5.

Both are valid.

I'll go with ""SCION"" because it tests C in position2 which is common? And S at position1.

Also, SCION is a word meaning a descendant.

After this, we can get feedback on where C and N are, plus the letters S,I,O.

So <guess>SCION</guess>

But let's double-check the previous feedback: we had CRANE -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x). So secret word must have C and N, no R,A,E.

SCION: S,C,I,O,N - all valid letters? S: new, C: known, I: new, O: new, N: known.

Yes.

Perhaps ""MINCE""? M,I,N,C,E? E is forbidden? We know E is not in word? So MINCE has E? So invalid? E is excluded.

Therefore, SCION and SONIC avoid excluded letters.

I think SCION is a good guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

Therefore:
- The secret word contains C and N, excludes R, A, and E.
- C must be in a position other than 1 (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).
- N must be in a position other than 4 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- The next guess must include C and N, exclude R, A, and E, and test new letters to maximize information.

For the second guess, ""SCION"" is chosen because:
- It includes both C and N (C at position 2, N at position 5—both are new positions since C’s previous position was 1 and N’s was 4).
- It excludes R, A, and E.
- It tests new letters (S at position 1, I at position 3, O at position 4), covering high-frequency consonants and vowels.
- The word is valid (5-letter English word) and helps probe potential positions for C and N while gathering data on S, I, and O.

<guess>SCION</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SCION -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: '-' → present but wrong position (not position 1)
- R: 'x' → not in word
- A: 'x' → not in word
- N: '-' → present but wrong position (not position 4)
- E: 'x' → not in word

Second guess: SCION
- S: 'x' → not in word
- C: '-' → present but wrong position (not position 2, because in SCION, C is at position 2)
- I: 'x' → not in word
- O: 'x' → not in word
- N: '-' → present but wrong position (not position 5, because in SCION, N is at position 5)

What we know so far:
- The secret word contains C and N (from both guesses).
- The secret word does not contain R, A, E, S, I, O (all marked 'x' in at least one guess).
- C is not in position 1 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from SCION). So C must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- N is not in position 4 (from CRANE) and not in position 5 (from SCION). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We have constraints on C and N.

Also, since C and N are both present, and we have positions to assign.

Now, the word cannot have R, A, E, S, I, O. So available letters are from the remaining alphabet.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a 5-letter word with C and N, and three other letters from the above, excluding the forbidden ones.

Moreover, we know the positions where C and N cannot be.

Let's list possible positions for C: 3,4,5
For N: 1,2,3

But note: if N is in position 3, then C cannot be in position 3? Well, they could be the same? But no, because if both are in position 3, that would be the same letter? But C and N are different. So they can share a position? No, each position has one letter. So if N is in position 3, then C cannot be in position 3. Similarly, if C is in position 3, N cannot be.

So possible cases:

Case 1: N in position 1, then C in 3,4, or 5
Case 2: N in position 2, then C in 3,4, or 5
Case 3: N in position 3, then C in 4 or 5 (since 3 is taken by N)

Similarly, if C is in 3, then N can be in 1 or 2 (not 3)
If C in 4, N in 1,2,3
If C in 5, N in 1,2,3

But we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong.

Now, we need to choose a word that includes C and N, and three new letters, and places C and N in the possible positions to test.

We also want to test common letters to get more information.

Common letters left: T, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.

We should avoid using letters that are already excluded: R, A, E, S, I, O.

Let's think of words that have C and N, and use common letters.

For example, words like ""CLUNK"", ""CHUNK"", ""FUNKY"", but F and K are less common? Or ""PUNCH"", ""LUNCH"", ""BUNCH"", etc.

But we have to consider the position constraints.

Also, we know C cannot be in 1 or 2, so C must be in 3,4,5.

Similarly, N cannot be in 4 or 5, so N must be in 1,2,3.

Let's try to form a word with N in position 1 or 2, and C in 3,4, or 5.

For instance:
- If N is at 1: then the word starts with N. Then C at 3,4, or 5.
  - Examples: ""N"" _ _ _ _ 
    - With C at 3: ""N?C??"", e.g., ""NICHE"" but I is excluded, so not. ""NACHO"" but A excluded. So need letters from available set.
    - Available: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,P,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
    - ""N"" at 1, then position 2: say U (vowel?), position 3: C? Then ""NUC??"" -> ""NUCLE"" but E excluded. ""NUKED"" E excluded. Not many common words.
    - ""N"" at 1, C at 4: ""N? ? C ?"", e.g., ""NIGHT"" but no C? ""NICHT"" not English. ""NATCH"" A excluded. Hard.

- N at 2: then the word has second letter N. C at 3,4,5.
  - Pattern: _ N _ _ _
  - With C at 3: _ N C _ _ , e.g., ""UNCLO"" but O excluded. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""UNCLE"" E excluded. ""UNCUT"" U and T? ""UNCUT"" has U,C,T. But C is at position 3? Let's see: U(1), N(2), C(3), U(4)? No, ""UNCUT"" is U, N, C, U, T? Positions: 1-U, 2-N, 3-C, 4-U, 5-T. But U repeated? And we don't know if U is allowed? We haven't tested U.

But U is not excluded yet, so it could be.

Similarly, ""UNCLY"" not a word.

""BUNCH"": B(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5). But in this case, N is at position 3? And C at position 4.

But we have constraints: N must be in 1,2,3. Here N at 3 is allowed? Yes, because we only know N not at 4 or 5. Similarly, C at 4 is allowed? C can be at 4? Yes, since C not at 1 or 2.

In ""BUNCH"": 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: C
- Position 5: H

Now, N is at 3, which is a possible position. C is at 4, which is also possible.

And letters: B, U, N, C, H. All not excluded? B, U, H are new, N and C known.

But we have to check if U is allowed? We haven't had feedback on U, so it could be in the word or not.

Similarly, B and H.

Also, ""BUNCH"" is a valid word.

Another possibility: ""LUNCH"" L(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) — similar.

Or ""PUNCH"" P(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5)

Now, what about N at 3 and C at 5? For example, ""MINCE"" but E excluded and I excluded? I is excluded. ""DANCE"" A and E excluded. Not good.

C at 5: ""? ? ? ? C"", with N at 1,2, or 3.

If N at 1: ""N ? ? ? C"", e.g., ""NIGHT"" no C. ""NOVEL"" O and E excluded.

If N at 2: ""? N ? ? C"", e.g., ""UNLIT"" no C. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""ONCET"" not word.

If N at 3: ""? ? N ? C"", e.g., ""BENCH"" E excluded. ""PINCH"" I excluded. ""LUNCH"" has C at 4, not 5.

""LUNCH"" has C at 4. To have C at 5, we need words like ""PUNCH"" same as above? ""PUNCH"" is P,U,N,C,H — C at 4.

What about ""CLANK""? C at 1? But C cannot be at 1. Not allowed.

""KNACK"" has double C? But C at 4 and 5? But we know C is present, but not necessarily double. And K at 1, N at 2, A at 3? A excluded.

Not good.

So back to ""BUNCH"" or ""LUNCH"" or ""PUNCH"".

In these, N is at position 3 and C at position 4.

We also have the possibility of C at position 3 and N at position 1 or 2.

For example, C at 3: then N at 1 or 2.

If N at 1: ""N ? C ? ?"", e.g., ""NICHE"" I excluded. ""NACHO"" A excluded. ""NECKS"" E excluded. Not many options.

If N at 2: ""? N C ? ?"", e.g., ""UNCLE"" E excluded. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""ONCET"" not word. ""ANCHO"" A excluded.

So it seems difficult to find words with C at 3 and N at 1 or 2 without using excluded letters.

Therefore, the most feasible are words with N at 3 and C at 4, like ""BUNCH"", ""LUNCH"", ""PUNCH"", ""HUNCH"", etc.

We can also consider C at 5? But we don't have a common word with C at 5 and N at 1,2,3 without excluded letters.

For example, ""TRUNC"" not a word. ""CLINK"" C at 1 not allowed.

""ZINC"" is 4 letters? Not 5.

So let's go with ""PUNCH"" or ""LUNCH"".

But we need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have to avoid S, I, O, R, A, E.

Available vowels: U and Y? And consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, etc.

In ""PUNCH"", we have P, U, N, C, H.

U is a vowel, which is good to test.

Similarly, in ""LUNCH"", L, U, N, C, H.

We don't know about U, P, L, H.

We can choose either.

But let's see if we can include T, which is very common.

For example, ""PUNCH"" doesn't have T. ""LUNCH"" doesn't.

What about ""HUNCH""? Same as above.

Or ""CLUNK""? C at 1 not allowed.

""FUNKY""? F,U,N,K,Y. But C is missing? We must include C.

We must include both C and N.

Another idea: ""NICHT"" not English.

""YUCKY"" no N or C? Not.

So I think ""PUNCH"" is a good candidate.

But let's confirm the positions: in ""PUNCH"", P at 1, U at 2, N at 3, C at 4, H at 5.

Now, for N: position 3 is new (previously tried at 4 and 5, both wrong). For C: position 4 is new (previously tried at 1 and 2, both wrong).

So we are testing new positions for both.

Also, we test P, U, H.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another word: ""MUNCH"" M,U,N,C,H.

Similarly.

I think ""PUNCH"" is fine.

But let's see if there is a word with T.

For example, ""NUTTY"" no C. ""CUTIN"" I excluded. ""CANTY"" A excluded.

Not easy.

""COUNT"" O excluded. ""JOINT"" O and I excluded? O and I are excluded.

So I think ""PUNCH"" is acceptable.

We'll go with ""PUNCH"".

But in the feedback, we might get information about U, P, H.

If U is not in the word, we know, etc.

So <guess>PUNCH</guess>

But let's write it.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - R, A, E are not in the word.  
  - N is in the word but not in position 4.  

- **Guess 2: SCION**  
  Feedback: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - S, I, O are not in the word.  
  - C is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - N is in the word but not in position 5.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters in the Word**:  
   - C and N must be present (both received ""-"" in feedback, indicating they are in the word but misplaced).  
   - C cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from CRANE and SCION feedback).  
   - N cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from CRANE and SCION feedback).  
   - Therefore, C must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - R, A, E (from CRANE), S, I, O (from SCION) are not in the word.  
   - Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and Y can act as a vowel).  

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  
   - Must include C and N to test their valid positions (C: 3,4,5; N: 1,2,3).  
   - Avoid excluded letters (R, A, E, S, I, O).  
   - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, L, U, H, P) to gather more information.  
   - Prioritize words where C and N are placed in new untested positions to resolve ambiguity:  
     - C was previously in position 1 (CRANE) and 2 (SCION), so test position 3, 4, or 5.  
     - N was previously in position 4 (CRANE) and 5 (SCION), so test position 1, 2, or 3.  
   - Given the constraints, words like **PUNCH** (C at position 4, N at position 3) or **LUNCH** (same positions) are strong candidates. They use common letters (U, H, P/L) and fit the positional rules.  

**Chosen Guess: PUNCH**  
- **Why PUNCH?**  
  - Contains C (position 4) and N (position 3), both in new valid positions.  
  - Uses new letters: P (position 1), U (position 2), H (position 5) — all untested and common.  
  - Avoids excluded letters (R, A, E, S, I, O).  
  - If U is in the word, feedback will confirm it (and whether it's in position 2). Similarly, P and H will be tested.  
  - This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for C and N while probing new letters.

<guess>PUNCH</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SCION -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)
Guess 3: PUNCH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) N(✓) C(✓) H(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from Guess 3: PUNCH -> P(x) U(✓) N(✓) C(✓) H(✓)
This means:
- P is not in the word (x)
- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since in PUNCH, U is the second letter)
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in PUNCH, N is the third letter)
- C is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since in PUNCH, C is the fourth letter)
- H is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since in PUNCH, H is the fifth letter)

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word has the form: ? U N C H
- The first letter is unknown, but it cannot be P (since P is not in the word), and also cannot be any previously excluded letters: R, A, E, S, I, O (from previous feedback).

Moreover, we know the word must be ? U N C H, and the first letter must be a letter that hasn't been excluded and is not U, N, C, H (since those are already placed and we don't have information about duplicates, but typically we assume no duplicates unless indicated, but we should be cautious).

But note: the feedback for U, N, C, H are all correct (✓), meaning they are in the right positions. So the word ends with ""UNCH"" and the first letter is missing.

Now, what letters are possible for the first position?
Excluded letters so far: R, A, E, S, I, O, P (from the x's in all guesses).

So excluded: R, A, E, S, I, O, P.

We also know from the word structure, the first letter cannot be U, N, C, H because:
- U is at position 2, so if the first letter were U, it would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate so far, and the rules don't forbid it, but we should consider the possibility.

But in the previous feedback, when we had CRANE and SCION, we didn't have any duplicates, and the feedback didn't indicate duplicates. So it's possible, but to be safe, we can first assume no duplicates and then adjust if needed.

Given that, the first letter must be a letter not in {U, N, C, H} and not in the excluded list.

Excluded: R, A, E, S, I, O, P.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, and possibly others.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word of the form ? U N C H.

What are possible English words?
- BUNCH: but we already guessed PUNCH, and B is available? BUNCH is a word, but we know P is not in the word, and BUNCH has B at first.
- Similarly, HUNCH: but H is at position 5, so if we put H at first, it would be duplicate? But H is already at position 5, so if the word has two H's? But in BUNCH, no H at first? HUNCH would be H U N C H, so H at position 1 and 5? That's possible.

But let's list common words ending with ""UNCH"":
- BUNCH
- HUNCH
- LUNCH (but L is available? We haven't excluded L)
- MUNCH
- DUNCH? Not common.
- GUNCH? Not common.

We already know PUNCH is not the word because P is excluded and we got P(x) in feedback.

So possible words: BUNCH, HUNCH, LUNCH, MUNCH.

But we have to check if the first letter is excluded or not.

Excluded letters: R, A, E, S, I, O, P.

So:
- BUNCH: B is not excluded -> possible.
- HUNCH: H is already in the word at position 5. If the word allows duplicates, it's possible. But we don't know. However, in the feedback for PUNCH, we had H(✓) at position 5, but if H were also at position 1, we would have seen a '-' for H in position 1 if we had guessed it? But we didn't. So we cannot rule out duplicates. But in this case, for HUNCH, we have H at 1 and 5. Similarly, for MUNCH, M is not excluded.

But we have to make a guess that is a valid word.

We can guess one of these to solve the puzzle.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and this is guess 4. We can try to guess the word directly if we think we have enough information.

Possible words: BUNCH, HUNCH, LUNCH, MUNCH.

We haven't tested B, L, M, etc.

But we can choose one that uses a common letter or just pick one.

Since we have U, N, C, H fixed, and only the first letter unknown, we can try to guess.

But we must make a valid guess.

Let's see which of these are valid:

- BUNCH: valid
- HUNCH: valid
- LUNCH: valid
- MUNCH: valid

We don't know which one it is.

But we have to make a guess.

We can use a guess that includes a new letter to confirm, but since we are at the fourth guess, and we have only one letter missing, it's efficient to guess one of these.

But if we guess wrong, we lose a try, but we have two more tries.

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested any of B, L, M? No, so we don't know if they are in the word or not.

But in this case, the word is ?UNCH, so the first letter is the only unknown, and it must be one of these.

We can guess ""BUNCH"" to test B.

If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that B is not in the word, then we can try another.

Similarly for others.

But we have to choose one.

Since we have no information about B, L, M, we can start with the most common one.

""LUNCH"" is very common.

But let's see the frequency.

We can also consider that in the first position, we have constraints from common words.

But I think it's safe to guess one.

To be strategic, we can choose a word that tests a letter that might be used in other positions, but here the positions are fixed.

Another idea: we can guess a word that is not necessarily ?UNCH but that includes other letters to test? But that would be inefficient because we know 4 letters are fixed and correct.

For example, if we guess ""LAUGH"", but that doesn't have N,C,H in the right places? No, we know U,N,C,H are fixed in positions 2,3,4,5.

So we must have ? U N C H.

So we cannot change that.

Therefore, we must guess a word of that form.

So I think we should guess ""LUNCH"" because L is a common starting letter.

But let's list the possibilities:

1. BUNCH
2. HUNCH
3. LUNCH
4. MUNCH

We can also consider ""DUNCH"" but it's not common, or ""GUNCH"", not common.

So likely one of these four.

Now, we have excluded P, so PUNCH is out.

We haven't excluded B, H, L, M.

But H is already in the word at position 5. If we guess HUNCH, it has H at position 1 and 5. Is that allowed? The rules don't forbid duplicate letters, so it is possible.

Similarly, for others, no duplicates.

In the feedback, when we guessed PUNCH, we had H(✓) at position 5, but we didn't have any indication about position 1. So if the word is HUNCH, then H is at position 1 and 5, but when we guessed PUNCH, we only had H at position 5, so it was correct, and we didn't have a H at position 1 in the guess, so we didn't get feedback on that. So it's possible.

Similarly, for other words.

To decide, we can think about which one is more likely, but we don't have frequency data.

We can use the fact that we haven't seen any duplicate so far, so perhaps duplicates are less likely? But we don't know.

To minimize risk, we can guess a word without duplicate first, like LUNCH or BUNCH or MUNCH.

Let's pick ""LUNCH"" as it is a very common word.

So <guess>LUNCH</guess>

But if it's wrong, we get feedback and then we can guess again.

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested L? No, so if we guess LUNCH and it's wrong, we know L is not in the word, then we can try MUNCH or BUNCH.

Similarly.

I think it's fine.

So I'll go with LUNCH.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C and N are in the word but not in positions 1 or 4, respectively.  
  - R, A, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: SCION**  
  Feedback: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C and N are in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, respectively.  
  - S, I, O are not in the word.  

- **Guess 3: PUNCH**  
  Feedback: P(x) U(✓) N(✓) C(✓) H(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - U, N, C, H are in the word and in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, 4, 5).  
  - P is not in the word.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Secret Word Structure**:  
   - The feedback for PUNCH confirms that the secret word has the form `? U N C H` (where `?` is the unknown first letter).  
   - U is fixed at position 2, N at 3, C at 4, and H at 5.  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - From all feedback: R, A, E, S, I, O, P are not in the word.  
   - Available letters for position 1: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (since U, N, C, H are already placed and duplicates are possible but unconfirmed).  

3. **Possible Words**:  
   - Common English words fitting `? U N C H`:  
     - **BUNCH**: B at position 1.  
     - **HUNCH**: H at position 1 (duplicate of position 5 H).  
     - **LUNCH**: L at position 1.  
     - **MUNCH**: M at position 1.  
   - Less common options (e.g., DUNCH, GUNCH) are possible but lower probability.  

4. **Strategy for Guess 4**:  
   - Since 4 letters are confirmed and positioned, the goal is to test the first letter with a valid word.  
   - Prioritize high-frequency options: LUNCH is a common word and tests L (untested letter).  
   - If incorrect, feedback on L will resolve the remaining possibilities (e.g., if L is excluded, try BUNCH or MUNCH next).  

**Chosen Guess: LUNCH**  
- **Why LUNCH?**  
  - Fits the `? U N C H` structure with L in position 1.  
  - Tests L, a new high-frequency consonant not yet evaluated.  
  - Avoids excluded letters and minimizes risk of duplicates (unlike HUNCH).  
  - If correct, the game is solved. If not, feedback on L will narrow options to BUNCH, MUNCH, or HUNCH for the next guess.

Typically, words with common letters and minimal repeating letters are chosen.\n\nI recall that in Wordle, words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"" are often recommended as starting words because they contain a mix of common consonants and vowels.\n\nOne crucial point: The game expects a valid English word. We cannot use non-English words.\n\nI will choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and a combination of vowels and consonants.\n\nLet me pick ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It has C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.\n\nAlternatively, ""RAISE"" is also a very good starting word because it has two vowels and three consonants, including R, S which are common.\n\nBut I remember that ""SLATE"" is often used. \n\nHowever, I don\'t think the exact word matters too much as long as it\'s balanced. Let me go with ""RAISE"" because it covers A, I (vowels) and R, S, E (which is both vowel and consonant, but E is common).\n\nAnother popular one is ""ADIEU"" which has many vowels, but it might not be the best because we get fewer consonants? \n\nLet me decide: I will use ""CRANE"".\n\nSo, my first guess is: CRANE\n\nBut note: the example in the instructions used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". So I should avoid using any of these? Actually, we can use any word.\n\nI\'ll go with ""CRANE"".\n\nAfter making the guess, we\'ll get feedback and then we can use that to make the next guess.\n\nBut for now, we are only making the first guess.\n\nSo, let\'s output: <guess>CRANE</guess>\n\nWait, but the format should be exactly: <guess> guessed-word </guess>\n\nSo, I will return <guess>CRANE</guess>To start the game, I need to make an initial 5-letter word guess with no prior feedback. My goal is to maximize information by choosing a word with common letters and a mix of vowels/consonants. A strong opening word should:\n- Cover frequent letters (e.g., E, A, R, S, T).\n- Avoid repeated letters.\n- Include vowels to help narrow down possibilities.\n\nI selected **""CRANE""** because:\n- It uses five distinct letters.\n- Contains three vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N)—note that E is a vowel here.\n- Features high-frequency letters (E, R, A), which appear in many English words.\n- This word will provide feedback on common characters, helping eliminate large groups for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for our first guess:\n- C: \'-\' meaning C is in the word but not in the correct position (which was position 1)\n- R: \'x\' meaning R is not in the secret word at all\n- A: \'x\' meaning A is not in the secret word\n- N: \'-\' meaning N is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in CRANE)\n- E: \'x\' meaning E is not in the secret word\n\nSo, from this, we know:\n- The secret word contains the letters C and N, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.\n- The secret word does NOT contain R, A, or E.\n\nAlso, since C and N are present, but not in their guessed positions, we can deduce:\n- C must appear in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not position 1).\n- N must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not position 4).\n\nMoreover, we know the secret word has no R, A, E.\n\nNow, for our second guess:\n- We must include C and N (since they are in the word).\n- We should exclude R, A, E.\n- We need to try to put C and N in positions where they might be correct, and also include new letters to test.\n\nConstraints on positions for C and N:\n- C cannot be in position 1 again. Possible positions: 2,3,4,5.\n- N cannot be in position 4 again. Possible positions:1,2,3,5.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters (since R,A,E are out) that might be in the word. Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.\n\nLet\'s think of a word that:\n- Contains C and N.\n- Does not contain R,A,E.\n- Places C in one of positions 2,3,4,5 and N in a position not 4 (i.e., 1,2,3,5).\n\nTo maximize information, we can try to put C and N in positions they haven\'t been tried yet, and also test new positions.\n\nIn our first guess:\n- C was in position 1\n- N was in position 4\n\nSo for C: we can try position 2,3,4 or5. Similarly, N: try position 1,2,3,5.\n\nNow, can we put both in positions that are different? Also, we have 3 other letters to choose.\n\nLet me list some possible words.\n\nSince C cannot be in position1, and we know position1 is not C, and not R,A,E. But we don\'t know position1. It must be a letter that isn\'t C (but C is elsewhere), and not R,A,E.\n\nAlso, position1 cannot be the same as the letters excluded? All positions must not be R,A,E since they are not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, position3 is not A? But A is not in the word, so position3 cannot be A. Actually, no R,A,E anywhere.\n\nNow, we have to choose a word without R,A,E, with C and N, and not place C at position1 or N at position4.\n\nLet me try to think of words that start with different letters, since position1 is unknown.\n\nWe can try picking a word with S or T, which are common.\n\nFor example, let\'s try putting C at position 3 and N at position 2? Then the word would be ? N C ? ?\n\nPossible words: \n\n- Must include N and C.\n\nWhat if we try something like ""SONIC""? But S is new, O is vowel (but we don\'t know about O yet), N at position4? But we know N is not in position4 (from feedback: N was in position4 and got \'-\', meaning it is not correct there). So we cannot put N in position4 again? Actually, we can, but the feedback said N is in the word but not at position4, so if we put it again at position4, it would get \'-\' again. But it\'s inefficient. We should put N in a new position to test.\n\nSimilarly for C.\n\nSo we should avoid position4 for N and position1 for C.\n\nTherefore, ""SONIC"" has N at position4? No: S(1) O(2) N(3) I(4) C(5)? Wait, let me index: \nPosition: 1-S, 2-O, 3-N, 4-I, 5-C.\n\nBut N is at position3 (not position4), and C is at position5 (not position1). So that works? And it avoids R,A,E.\n\nBut let me check the letters: S,O,N,I,C. We don\'t have R,A,E, so okay.\n\nIs ""SONIC"" valid? Yes, it\'s a word.\n\nBut we also know from feedback that C is in the word but not position1 (which we knew), but in SONIC, C is at position5, so if the secret word has C at position5, it would get \'✓\'. If not, \'x\' or \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly, N is at position3.\n\nBut we want to test new positions.\n\nAnother option: words beginning with C? But C cannot be position1? Wait, feedback said C is not in position1, and since it\'s present but not position1, we shouldn\'t put it at position1 again. So position1 can be something else.\n\nWe can put position1 as a new letter, say S or T.\n\nWhat about ""SNICK""? S,N,I,C,K. But K is new.\n\n""SNICK"" has S at1, N at2, I at3, C at4, K at5. But N is at position2 (not 4), C at position4 (not 1). So positions: avoid position4 for N? Position4 here is C, not N. N is at2.\n\nN is at2 (which is new position compared to previous) and C at4 (which was position1 before? No, C was at1 now at position4).\n\nBut ""SNICK"" might be uncommon? Let\'s see if it\'s a word.\n\nSNICK: as in snick or snee? It might be acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s think of a word with C and N and common vowels. Vowels: We know no A, E. So vowels left: I,O,U,Y.\n\nWe can use O,I,U,Y as vowels.\n\nFor example, ""CLINT"": C,L,I,N,T? Positions:1-C,2-L,3-I,4-N,5-T. But C cannot be at position1? Because we have feedback that C is in the word but not position1. So if we put C at1, it would be incorrect. And since we know it\'s not position1, if we put it there, we lose information? Actually, the feedback would still say \'-\' if it\'s in the word but wrong position, but we know position1 is wrong for C, so it\'s wasteful to put it there again.\n\nSimilarly, ""CLINT"" has C at position1? So we\'d get \'-\' for C? And N at position4? But N was previously at position4 and got \'-\', meaning not position4. Now we\'re putting N at position4 again? Then it will also give \'-\'? And we don\'t test a new position for N.\n\nSo we should avoid putting C at position1 and N at position4.\n\nTherefore, ""CLINT"" is not good.\n\nAnother word: ""CONIC"": has O and I. Positions:1-C,2-O,3-N,4-I,5-C. Oh wait, two C\'s? But secret word might have double? Feedback didn\'t show double, but allowed? Wordle allows doubles? The rules didn\'t say not to.\n\nBut in feedback, each letter is considered? And ""CONIC"" has C at position1 and position5? But we know C is in the word but not position1, so putting at position1 might confuse? And at position5.\n\nBut let\'s see if the secret word has double letters? We don\'t know.\n\nBut for efficiency, we should avoid repeating letters if possible, since we don\'t know.\n\nAlso, C in position1 is not good because we already know position1 is not C.\n\nSo better to choose a word with C elsewhere.\n\nAlternative: ""PINCH"" P,I,N,C,H? Positions:1-P,2-I,3-N,4-C,5-H? Then N at position3 (not 4), C at position4 (not 1). So avoid position4 for N? Yes, position3 is new for N.\n\nBut also, we have new letters P,I,N,C,H. But N and C are known, P,I,H new.\n\nAlso, no vowels? I is vowel? Yes.\n\nBut we don\'t know about I.\n\nNow, let\'s consider how to cover more common letters.\n\nSince R is out, and E,A out, we have: S, T, L, I, O, U, M, P, D, etc.\n\nLet me think of a word: Maybe ""SCION""?: S,C,I,O,N. Positions:1-S,2-C,3-I,4-O,5-N. Then C at position2 (not position1, good), N at position5 (not position4, good). And letters are all distinct: S,C,I,O,N.\n\nAnd no R,A,E.\n\nAlso, S and T are very common, but T is not included? In this case, we test S, C, I, O, N.\n\nC and N are already known to be present. So we are retesting them? But in different positions, which is good to find the correct spots.\n\nMoreover, we test O and I? Which may or may not be present.\n\nThis seems decent.\n\nAnother possibility: ""MUNCH""? M,U,N,C,H? Has U and no I or O. But similarly.\n\n""SCION"" seems fine.\n\n""SONIC"": as I thought earlier: S(1) O(2) N(3) I(4) C(5). C at5 and N at3? Both new positions.\n\nIn SONIC: position1=S, position2=O, position3=N, position4=I, position5=C.\n\nCompared to SCION? SCION: S,C,I,O,N -> positions:1-S,2-C,3-I,4-O,5-N.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nIn SONIC, N is at position3 and C at position5.\n\nWe don\'t know which is better.\n\nBoth avoid known bad positions.\n\nBut in SCION, C is tried at position2 which is a new position and might be correct? Or not.\n\nSimilarly for SONIC: C at5 or N at3.\n\nEither is okay.\n\nBut let me see the frequency: position2 and position5 might be more common for certain letters? Not sure.\n\nAnother word: ""STOIC"": S,T,O,I,C? Positions:1-S,2-T,3-O,4-I,5-C. Then only C at position5? And N is missing? Oh N! We know N must be in the word, so our next guess must include N? Because we have to use that information.\n\nYes, important: since we know N is present, we should include it to narrow down its position.\n\nSimilarly for C, but C is harder to place? But we have to include C too.\n\nIn STOIC, it has C but no N? So we wouldn\'t be including N, which is bad? Because we know N is in the word, if we don\'t put N, we get zero information about its position? We might get \'x\' for N if we dont put it? But it will appear as not tested.\n\nFor efficiency, we should include both known present letters: C and N.\n\nSo words without C or without N are wasteful.\n\nTherefore, pin point: must include C and N, must exclude R, A, E.\n\nSo back to SCION or SONIC.\n\nSCION: S-C-I-O-N, positions: S1, C2, I3, O4, N5.\n\nSONIC: S1, O2, N3, I4, C5.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SCION"" because it tests C in position2 which is common? And S at position1.\n\nAlso, SCION is a word meaning a descendant.\n\nAfter this, we can get feedback on where C and N are, plus the letters S,I,O.\n\nSo <guess>SCION</guess>\n\nBut let\'s double-check the previous feedback: we had CRANE -> C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x). So secret word must have C and N, no R,A,E.\n\nSCION: S,C,I,O,N - all valid letters? S: new, C: known, I: new, O: new, N: known.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps ""MINCE""? M,I,N,C,E? E is forbidden? We know E is not in word? So MINCE has E? So invalid? E is excluded.\n\nTherefore, SCION and SONIC avoid excluded letters.\n\nI think SCION is a good guess.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C is in the word but not in position 1.\n- R is not in the word.\n- A is not in the word.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E is not in the word.\n\nTherefore:\n- The secret word contains C and N, excludes R, A, and E.\n- C must be in a position other than 1 (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).\n- N must be in a position other than 4 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n- The next guess must include C and N, exclude R, A, and E, and test new letters to maximize information.\n\nFor the second guess, ""SCION"" is chosen because:\n- It includes both C and N (C at position 2, N at position 5—both are new positions since C’s previous position was 1 and N’s was 4).\n- It excludes R, A, and E.\n- It tests new letters (S at position 1, I at position 3, O at position 4), covering high-frequency consonants and vowels.\n- The word is valid (5-letter English word) and helps probe potential positions for C and N while gathering data on S, I, and O.\n\n<guess>SCION</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SCION -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: CRANE\n- C: \'-\' → present but wrong position (not position 1)\n- R: \'x\' → not in word\n- A: \'x\' → not in word\n- N: \'-\' → present but wrong position (not position 4)\n- E: \'x\' → not in word\n\nSecond guess: SCION\n- S: \'x\' → not in word\n- C: \'-\' → present but wrong position (not position 2, because in SCION, C is at position 2)\n- I: \'x\' → not in word\n- O: \'x\' → not in word\n- N: \'-\' → present but wrong position (not position 5, because in SCION, N is at position 5)\n\nWhat we know so far:\n- The secret word contains C and N (from both guesses).\n- The secret word does not contain R, A, E, S, I, O (all marked \'x\' in at least one guess).\n- C is not in position 1 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from SCION). So C must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n- N is not in position 4 (from CRANE) and not in position 5 (from SCION). So N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions. We have constraints on C and N.\n\nAlso, since C and N are both present, and we have positions to assign.\n\nNow, the word cannot have R, A, E, S, I, O. So available letters are from the remaining alphabet.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we need to form a 5-letter word with C and N, and three other letters from the above, excluding the forbidden ones.\n\nMoreover, we know the positions where C and N cannot be.\n\nLet\'s list possible positions for C: 3,4,5\nFor N: 1,2,3\n\nBut note: if N is in position 3, then C cannot be in position 3? Well, they could be the same? But no, because if both are in position 3, that would be the same letter? But C and N are different. So they can share a position? No, each position has one letter. So if N is in position 3, then C cannot be in position 3. Similarly, if C is in position 3, N cannot be.\n\nSo possible cases:\n\nCase 1: N in position 1, then C in 3,4, or 5\nCase 2: N in position 2, then C in 3,4, or 5\nCase 3: N in position 3, then C in 4 or 5 (since 3 is taken by N)\n\nSimilarly, if C is in 3, then N can be in 1 or 2 (not 3)\nIf C in 4, N in 1,2,3\nIf C in 5, N in 1,2,3\n\nBut we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong.\n\nNow, we need to choose a word that includes C and N, and three new letters, and places C and N in the possible positions to test.\n\nWe also want to test common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon letters left: T, L, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.\n\nWe should avoid using letters that are already excluded: R, A, E, S, I, O.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have C and N, and use common letters.\n\nFor example, words like ""CLUNK"", ""CHUNK"", ""FUNKY"", but F and K are less common? Or ""PUNCH"", ""LUNCH"", ""BUNCH"", etc.\n\nBut we have to consider the position constraints.\n\nAlso, we know C cannot be in 1 or 2, so C must be in 3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, N cannot be in 4 or 5, so N must be in 1,2,3.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word with N in position 1 or 2, and C in 3,4, or 5.\n\nFor instance:\n- If N is at 1: then the word starts with N. Then C at 3,4, or 5.\n  - Examples: ""N"" _ _ _ _ \n    - With C at 3: ""N?C??"", e.g., ""NICHE"" but I is excluded, so not. ""NACHO"" but A excluded. So need letters from available set.\n    - Available: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,P,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n    - ""N"" at 1, then position 2: say U (vowel?), position 3: C? Then ""NUC??"" -> ""NUCLE"" but E excluded. ""NUKED"" E excluded. Not many common words.\n    - ""N"" at 1, C at 4: ""N? ? C ?"", e.g., ""NIGHT"" but no C? ""NICHT"" not English. ""NATCH"" A excluded. Hard.\n\n- N at 2: then the word has second letter N. C at 3,4,5.\n  - Pattern: _ N _ _ _\n  - With C at 3: _ N C _ _ , e.g., ""UNCLO"" but O excluded. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""UNCLE"" E excluded. ""UNCUT"" U and T? ""UNCUT"" has U,C,T. But C is at position 3? Let\'s see: U(1), N(2), C(3), U(4)? No, ""UNCUT"" is U, N, C, U, T? Positions: 1-U, 2-N, 3-C, 4-U, 5-T. But U repeated? And we don\'t know if U is allowed? We haven\'t tested U.\n\nBut U is not excluded yet, so it could be.\n\nSimilarly, ""UNCLY"" not a word.\n\n""BUNCH"": B(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5). But in this case, N is at position 3? And C at position 4.\n\nBut we have constraints: N must be in 1,2,3. Here N at 3 is allowed? Yes, because we only know N not at 4 or 5. Similarly, C at 4 is allowed? C can be at 4? Yes, since C not at 1 or 2.\n\nIn ""BUNCH"": \n- Position 1: B\n- Position 2: U\n- Position 3: N\n- Position 4: C\n- Position 5: H\n\nNow, N is at 3, which is a possible position. C is at 4, which is also possible.\n\nAnd letters: B, U, N, C, H. All not excluded? B, U, H are new, N and C known.\n\nBut we have to check if U is allowed? We haven\'t had feedback on U, so it could be in the word or not.\n\nSimilarly, B and H.\n\nAlso, ""BUNCH"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother possibility: ""LUNCH"" L(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) — similar.\n\nOr ""PUNCH"" P(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5)\n\nNow, what about N at 3 and C at 5? For example, ""MINCE"" but E excluded and I excluded? I is excluded. ""DANCE"" A and E excluded. Not good.\n\nC at 5: ""? ? ? ? C"", with N at 1,2, or 3.\n\nIf N at 1: ""N ? ? ? C"", e.g., ""NIGHT"" no C. ""NOVEL"" O and E excluded.\n\nIf N at 2: ""? N ? ? C"", e.g., ""UNLIT"" no C. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""ONCET"" not word.\n\nIf N at 3: ""? ? N ? C"", e.g., ""BENCH"" E excluded. ""PINCH"" I excluded. ""LUNCH"" has C at 4, not 5.\n\n""LUNCH"" has C at 4. To have C at 5, we need words like ""PUNCH"" same as above? ""PUNCH"" is P,U,N,C,H — C at 4.\n\nWhat about ""CLANK""? C at 1? But C cannot be at 1. Not allowed.\n\n""KNACK"" has double C? But C at 4 and 5? But we know C is present, but not necessarily double. And K at 1, N at 2, A at 3? A excluded.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo back to ""BUNCH"" or ""LUNCH"" or ""PUNCH"".\n\nIn these, N is at position 3 and C at position 4.\n\nWe also have the possibility of C at position 3 and N at position 1 or 2.\n\nFor example, C at 3: then N at 1 or 2.\n\nIf N at 1: ""N ? C ? ?"", e.g., ""NICHE"" I excluded. ""NACHO"" A excluded. ""NECKS"" E excluded. Not many options.\n\nIf N at 2: ""? N C ? ?"", e.g., ""UNCLE"" E excluded. ""INCUR"" R excluded. ""ONCET"" not word. ""ANCHO"" A excluded.\n\nSo it seems difficult to find words with C at 3 and N at 1 or 2 without using excluded letters.\n\nTherefore, the most feasible are words with N at 3 and C at 4, like ""BUNCH"", ""LUNCH"", ""PUNCH"", ""HUNCH"", etc.\n\nWe can also consider C at 5? But we don\'t have a common word with C at 5 and N at 1,2,3 without excluded letters.\n\nFor example, ""TRUNC"" not a word. ""CLINK"" C at 1 not allowed.\n\n""ZINC"" is 4 letters? Not 5.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""PUNCH"" or ""LUNCH"".\n\nBut we need to choose one that tests new letters.\n\nWe have to avoid S, I, O, R, A, E.\n\nAvailable vowels: U and Y? And consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, etc.\n\nIn ""PUNCH"", we have P, U, N, C, H.\n\nU is a vowel, which is good to test.\n\nSimilarly, in ""LUNCH"", L, U, N, C, H.\n\nWe don\'t know about U, P, L, H.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can include T, which is very common.\n\nFor example, ""PUNCH"" doesn\'t have T. ""LUNCH"" doesn\'t.\n\nWhat about ""HUNCH""? Same as above.\n\nOr ""CLUNK""? C at 1 not allowed.\n\n""FUNKY""? F,U,N,K,Y. But C is missing? We must include C.\n\nWe must include both C and N.\n\nAnother idea: ""NICHT"" not English.\n\n""YUCKY"" no N or C? Not.\n\nSo I think ""PUNCH"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the positions: in ""PUNCH"", P at 1, U at 2, N at 3, C at 4, H at 5.\n\nNow, for N: position 3 is new (previously tried at 4 and 5, both wrong). For C: position 4 is new (previously tried at 1 and 2, both wrong).\n\nSo we are testing new positions for both.\n\nAlso, we test P, U, H.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAnother word: ""MUNCH"" M,U,N,C,H.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think ""PUNCH"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with T.\n\nFor example, ""NUTTY"" no C. ""CUTIN"" I excluded. ""CANTY"" A excluded.\n\nNot easy.\n\n""COUNT"" O excluded. ""JOINT"" O and I excluded? O and I are excluded.\n\nSo I think ""PUNCH"" is acceptable.\n\nWe\'ll go with ""PUNCH"".\n\nBut in the feedback, we might get information about U, P, H.\n\nIf U is not in the word, we know, etc.\n\nSo <guess>PUNCH</guess>\n\nBut let\'s write it.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE**  \n  Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  \n  - R, A, E are not in the word.  \n  - N is in the word but not in position 4.  \n\n- **Guess 2: SCION**  \n  Feedback: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - S, I, O are not in the word.  \n  - C is in the word but not in position 2.  \n  - N is in the word but not in position 5.  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **Confirmed Letters in the Word**:  \n   - C and N must be present (both received ""-"" in feedback, indicating they are in the word but misplaced).  \n   - C cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from CRANE and SCION feedback).  \n   - N cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from CRANE and SCION feedback).  \n   - Therefore, C must be in position 3, 4, or 5, and N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  \n\n2. **Excluded Letters**:  \n   - R, A, E (from CRANE), S, I, O (from SCION) are not in the word.  \n   - Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and Y can act as a vowel).  \n\n3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:  \n   - Must include C and N to test their valid positions (C: 3,4,5; N: 1,2,3).  \n   - Avoid excluded letters (R, A, E, S, I, O).  \n   - Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., T, L, U, H, P) to gather more information.  \n   - Prioritize words where C and N are placed in new untested positions to resolve ambiguity:  \n     - C was previously in position 1 (CRANE) and 2 (SCION), so test position 3, 4, or 5.  \n     - N was previously in position 4 (CRANE) and 5 (SCION), so test position 1, 2, or 3.  \n   - Given the constraints, words like **PUNCH** (C at position 4, N at position 3) or **LUNCH** (same positions) are strong candidates. They use common letters (U, H, P/L) and fit the positional rules.  \n\n**Chosen Guess: PUNCH**  \n- **Why PUNCH?**  \n  - Contains C (position 4) and N (position 3), both in new valid positions.  \n  - Uses new letters: P (position 1), U (position 2), H (position 5) — all untested and common.  \n  - Avoids excluded letters (R, A, E, S, I, O).  \n  - If U is in the word, feedback will confirm it (and whether it\'s in position 2). Similarly, P and H will be tested.  \n  - This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for C and N while probing new letters.\n\n<guess>PUNCH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SCION -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)\nGuess 3: PUNCH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) N(✓) C(✓) H(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from Guess 3: PUNCH -> P(x) U(✓) N(✓) C(✓) H(✓)\nThis means:\n- P is not in the word (x)\n- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since in PUNCH, U is the second letter)\n- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in PUNCH, N is the third letter)\n- C is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since in PUNCH, C is the fourth letter)\n- H is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since in PUNCH, H is the fifth letter)\n\nSo, from this, we know:\n- The secret word has the form: ? U N C H\n- The first letter is unknown, but it cannot be P (since P is not in the word), and also cannot be any previously excluded letters: R, A, E, S, I, O (from previous feedback).\n\nMoreover, we know the word must be ? U N C H, and the first letter must be a letter that hasn\'t been excluded and is not U, N, C, H (since those are already placed and we don\'t have information about duplicates, but typically we assume no duplicates unless indicated, but we should be cautious).\n\nBut note: the feedback for U, N, C, H are all correct (✓), meaning they are in the right positions. So the word ends with ""UNCH"" and the first letter is missing.\n\nNow, what letters are possible for the first position?\nExcluded letters so far: R, A, E, S, I, O, P (from the x\'s in all guesses).\n\nSo excluded: R, A, E, S, I, O, P.\n\nWe also know from the word structure, the first letter cannot be U, N, C, H because:\n- U is at position 2, so if the first letter were U, it would be a duplicate? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven\'t seen any duplicate so far, and the rules don\'t forbid it, but we should consider the possibility.\n\nBut in the previous feedback, when we had CRANE and SCION, we didn\'t have any duplicates, and the feedback didn\'t indicate duplicates. So it\'s possible, but to be safe, we can first assume no duplicates and then adjust if needed.\n\nGiven that, the first letter must be a letter not in {U, N, C, H} and not in the excluded list.\n\nExcluded: R, A, E, S, I, O, P.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, and possibly others.\n\nNow, we need to form a 5-letter word of the form ? U N C H.\n\nWhat are possible English words?\n- BUNCH: but we already guessed PUNCH, and B is available? BUNCH is a word, but we know P is not in the word, and BUNCH has B at first.\n- Similarly, HUNCH: but H is at position 5, so if we put H at first, it would be duplicate? But H is already at position 5, so if the word has two H\'s? But in BUNCH, no H at first? HUNCH would be H U N C H, so H at position 1 and 5? That\'s possible.\n\nBut let\'s list common words ending with ""UNCH"":\n- BUNCH\n- HUNCH\n- LUNCH (but L is available? We haven\'t excluded L)\n- MUNCH\n- DUNCH? Not common.\n- GUNCH? Not common.\n\nWe already know PUNCH is not the word because P is excluded and we got P(x) in feedback.\n\nSo possible words: BUNCH, HUNCH, LUNCH, MUNCH.\n\nBut we have to check if the first letter is excluded or not.\n\nExcluded letters: R, A, E, S, I, O, P.\n\nSo:\n- BUNCH: B is not excluded -> possible.\n- HUNCH: H is already in the word at position 5. If the word allows duplicates, it\'s possible. But we don\'t know. However, in the feedback for PUNCH, we had H(✓) at position 5, but if H were also at position 1, we would have seen a \'-\' for H in position 1 if we had guessed it? But we didn\'t. So we cannot rule out duplicates. But in this case, for HUNCH, we have H at 1 and 5. Similarly, for MUNCH, M is not excluded.\n\nBut we have to make a guess that is a valid word.\n\nWe can guess one of these to solve the puzzle.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 guesses, and this is guess 4. We can try to guess the word directly if we think we have enough information.\n\nPossible words: BUNCH, HUNCH, LUNCH, MUNCH.\n\nWe haven\'t tested B, L, M, etc.\n\nBut we can choose one that uses a common letter or just pick one.\n\nSince we have U, N, C, H fixed, and only the first letter unknown, we can try to guess.\n\nBut we must make a valid guess.\n\nLet\'s see which of these are valid:\n\n- BUNCH: valid\n- HUNCH: valid\n- LUNCH: valid\n- MUNCH: valid\n\nWe don\'t know which one it is.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nWe can use a guess that includes a new letter to confirm, but since we are at the fourth guess, and we have only one letter missing, it\'s efficient to guess one of these.\n\nBut if we guess wrong, we lose a try, but we have two more tries.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: have we tested any of B, L, M? No, so we don\'t know if they are in the word or not.\n\nBut in this case, the word is ?UNCH, so the first letter is the only unknown, and it must be one of these.\n\nWe can guess ""BUNCH"" to test B.\n\nIf it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that B is not in the word, then we can try another.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nSince we have no information about B, L, M, we can start with the most common one.\n\n""LUNCH"" is very common.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency.\n\nWe can also consider that in the first position, we have constraints from common words.\n\nBut I think it\'s safe to guess one.\n\nTo be strategic, we can choose a word that tests a letter that might be used in other positions, but here the positions are fixed.\n\nAnother idea: we can guess a word that is not necessarily ?UNCH but that includes other letters to test? But that would be inefficient because we know 4 letters are fixed and correct.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""LAUGH"", but that doesn\'t have N,C,H in the right places? No, we know U,N,C,H are fixed in positions 2,3,4,5.\n\nSo we must have ? U N C H.\n\nSo we cannot change that.\n\nTherefore, we must guess a word of that form.\n\nSo I think we should guess ""LUNCH"" because L is a common starting letter.\n\nBut let\'s list the possibilities:\n\n1. BUNCH\n2. HUNCH\n3. LUNCH\n4. MUNCH\n\nWe can also consider ""DUNCH"" but it\'s not common, or ""GUNCH"", not common.\n\nSo likely one of these four.\n\nNow, we have excluded P, so PUNCH is out.\n\nWe haven\'t excluded B, H, L, M.\n\nBut H is already in the word at position 5. If we guess HUNCH, it has H at position 1 and 5. Is that allowed? The rules don\'t forbid duplicate letters, so it is possible.\n\nSimilarly, for others, no duplicates.\n\nIn the feedback, when we guessed PUNCH, we had H(✓) at position 5, but we didn\'t have any indication about position 1. So if the word is HUNCH, then H is at position 1 and 5, but when we guessed PUNCH, we only had H at position 5, so it was correct, and we didn\'t have a H at position 1 in the guess, so we didn\'t get feedback on that. So it\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly, for other words.\n\nTo decide, we can think about which one is more likely, but we don\'t have frequency data.\n\nWe can use the fact that we haven\'t seen any duplicate so far, so perhaps duplicates are less likely? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo minimize risk, we can guess a word without duplicate first, like LUNCH or BUNCH or MUNCH.\n\nLet\'s pick ""LUNCH"" as it is a very common word.\n\nSo <guess>LUNCH</guess>\n\nBut if it\'s wrong, we get feedback and then we can guess again.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: have we tested L? No, so if we guess LUNCH and it\'s wrong, we know L is not in the word, then we can try MUNCH or BUNCH.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it\'s fine.\n\nSo I\'ll go with LUNCH.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE**  \n  Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - C and N are in the word but not in positions 1 or 4, respectively.  \n  - R, A, E are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: SCION**  \n  Feedback: S(x) C(-) I(x) O(x) N(-)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - C and N are in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, respectively.  \n  - S, I, O are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 3: PUNCH**  \n  Feedback: P(x) U(✓) N(✓) C(✓) H(✓)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - U, N, C, H are in the word and in the correct positions (positions 2, 3, 4, 5).  \n  - P is not in the word.  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **Secret Word Structure**:  \n   - The feedback for PUNCH confirms that the secret word has the form `?

We have feedback from Guess 4: LUNCH -> L(x) U(✓) N(✓) C(✓) H(✓)
 This means:
 - L is not in the word (x)
 - U, N, C, H are in the correct positions (positions 2,3,4,5)

 So the secret word is still of the form ? U N C H, and L is not the first letter and not in the word at all.

 Now, we know the first letter is not L, and also not any of the previously excluded letters: R, A, E, S, I, O, P.

 Previously excluded: R, A, E, S, I, O, P, and now L.

 Available letters for the first position: B, D, F, G, K, M, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But we have common words: BUNCH, HUNCH, MUNCH.

 Since L is excluded, LUNCH is not the word.

 Now, possible words: BUNCH, HUNCH, MUNCH.

 We need to choose one.

 We can guess ""BUNCH"" to test B.

 If we guess BUNCH and it's wrong, then we know B is not in the word, and we can guess MUNCH or HUNCH next.

 Alternatively, we can consider if there are other words? Like ""DUNCH"" or ""GUNCH"", but they are rare.

 So likely among BUNCH, HUNCH, MUNCH.

 Let's pick ""BUNCH"" as it is common.

 But note: HUNCH has a duplicate H? H at position 1 and 5. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any duplicate, but it's possible.

 Since we have limited guesses, and we are at guess 5, we can try BUNCH.

 If it's not, then the last guess can be either MUNCH or HUNCH.

 But we have two options left, and one guess after this? We are at guess 5, and we have 6 guesses total? The game allows 6 tries.

 So after this, we have one more if needed.

 So let's guess ""BUNCH"".

 <guess>BUNCH</guess>

 But if we want to be more efficient, we could think: have we tested M? No. But we don't have information.

 Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests multiple, but we can't because the last four letters are fixed.

 So we must guess one of the candidates.

 I think BUNCH is fine.
