We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters to maximize information.
Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

A good starting word is often one that has a mix of common vowels and consonants. For example, ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"". I recall that ""RAISE"" is a popular starter because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is another good one. But let's choose ""RAISE"" because it includes the vowel 'I' in addition to 'A' and 'E'. 

So, first guess: RAISE.

But note: We must output in the specified format.

Let me output: 
<guess>RAISE</guess>
</think>
For the first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants. This helps identify which letters are present in the secret word and their positions. 

I selected ""RAISE"" because:
- It includes 3 common vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).
- Letters like R, S, and E are statistically frequent in English words.
- This combination offers broad coverage to interpret feedback efficiently (e.g., reveals potential ✓, -, or x patterns).

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or S. But it does contain the letter E, but not in the last position.

Therefore, the secret word has the letter E in one of the first four positions (positions 1 to 4, since position 5 is where we had E and it was wrong).

We know the word has E, and we know it doesn't have R, A, I, S.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes E (to try to find its correct position) and
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet (since R, A, I, S are out).

We also avoid using R, A, I, S because they are not in the word.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

We know E is in the word, so we can try to put E in a different position. Since in ""RAISE"" it was at the end (position 5) and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test multiple new letters and also try to place E in a new position.

A good strategy is to use a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters that we haven't eliminated.

Let's think of words that have E and avoid R, A, I, S.

Possible letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Vowels: We know A and I are out, but O and U are still possible.

A good candidate might be a word like ""CLOUD"", but that doesn't have E. We need to include E.

Another idea: ""HOUSE"" but H, O, U, S, E -> but S is out, so not allowed.

We must avoid S.

How about ""THREE""? But that has 5 letters? No, ""THREE"" is 6 letters. We need 5 letters.

Let's think of 5-letter words with E and without R, A, I, S.

Some options:
- ""EVENT"": E, V, E, N, T -> but we have two E's? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know. But we can try. However, we have to consider that the feedback for E was only one occurrence (since we had one E and it was marked as present but wrong position). But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences. So the word might have more than one E? But in our guess, if we use two E's, we might get confusing feedback? Actually, it's okay because the feedback will mark each occurrence.

But we know that at least one E is present. If we use two E's, we might find out if there are two.

But let's avoid complexity for now and try to use one E and four new letters.

We can try to put E at the beginning? For example, words starting with E.

But note: we have to avoid R, A, I, S.

Common words: 
- ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W -> no R,A,I,S.
- ""EJECT"": E, J, E, C, T -> has two E's and J is uncommon.
- ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> no R,A,I,S.

But we also want to cover common letters.

Another idea: ""OUNCE"" -> O, U, N, C, E -> E at the end? But in the first guess, E was at the end and was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put E at the end again, and if the secret word has E at the end, it would be marked as correct (✓). But if it's not at the end, then we get more information.

But we know that E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at the end again, it will still be wrong position? Unless the secret word has two E's? But we don't know.

To maximize information, we should try E in a different position. Since it was at position 5 and wrong, we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let me list some words without R,A,I,S and with E in a different position.

Position 1: 
- ""ELITE"" -> but has I (which is out) and T, E -> I is not allowed because we know I is not in the word.
We must avoid I.

So no I.

Position 1: 
- ""EJECT"" -> has E, J, E, C, T -> but J is uncommon and we have two E's.
- ""EVERY"" -> has R (out) and Y.
- ""EXERT"" -> has R and X.

Avoid R.

Better: ""EVENT"" -> E, V, E, N, T -> has two E's and V, N, T. But we can use it? We don't know if V, N, T are in the word.

But we are trying to test new letters.

Another: ""ENEMY"" -> E, N, E, M, Y -> two E's and N, M, Y.

But Y is less common.

""OUNCE"" has E at the end, which we know is wrong. So if we put E at the end again, we might not get new information about E's position. But we can test other letters.

Alternatively, we can put E at position 1: ""EDGED"" -> two E's and D, G -> but G and D are good, but two E's and repeated D? Not ideal.

""ETHIC"" -> has H, C, but also I (which is out) -> invalid because I is not in the word and we can't use it.

We must use only letters that are not eliminated? No, we can use any letters, but we know that R, A, I, S are not in the word, so using them would be wasteful because they will be marked as x and we get no new information. So we should avoid using R, A, I, S.

So, back to ""ELBOW"": E (position1), L, B, O, W. This uses E in position 1 and new letters: L, B, O, W.

Another option: ""MEDLEY"" -> 6 letters, too long.

""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. This is good because we are trying E in a new position (position 2). And letters B, L, O, W are new.

Similarly, ""GLOBE"": G, L, O, B, E -> E at the end, which we know is wrong.

So ""BELOW"" seems better because E is in position 2.

Another candidate: ""CELLO"" -> C, E, L, L, O -> but has two L's? And E at position 2. But we can use it? However, repeated letters might not be ideal for information.

""BLOKE"": B, L, O, K, E -> E at the end, same as before.

""DEMON"": D, E, M, O, N -> E at position 2, and letters D, M, O, N.

This seems good: common letters D, M, O, N.

Similarly, ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> E at position 2, but L is also common.

But we have to choose one.

We also have to consider that we are trying to find the position of E.

Since E was not at position 5, and we try it at position 2, if it is correct, we get a ✓. If not, we know it's not at 2, and we can try other positions.

Moreover, we get information about D, M, O, N.

So ""DEMON"" is a good candidate.

Another one: ""HONEY"" -> H, O, N, E, Y -> E at position 4. That's also a new position.

But Y is less common.

""POUND"" -> no E, so not useful.

""FLOUT"" -> no E.

So between ""BELOW"", ""DEMON"", ""HONEY"", I think ""DEMON"" is better because it has more common consonants.

We can also consider ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D -> E at position 4. This is also good.

But let's choose one that has E in a position we haven't tried. We tried position 5, so positions 1,2,3,4 are open.

I think ""DEMON"" is a solid choice.

But note: we are not sure if the word has any of these letters, but we are trying to cover ground.

Another word: ""MOUNT"" -> no E.

""COULD"" -> no E.

So I'll go with ""DEMON"".

But let me confirm: D, E, M, O, N. No R, A, I, S. E is at position 2.

We can also consider ""BONEY"" -> B, O, N, E, Y -> but Y is less common.

""CONED"" -> C, O, N, E, D -> E at position 4.

But ""DEMON"" is a common word.

Alternatively, ""EVENT"" has two E's, which might be useful? But we don't know if there are two E's.

But let's stick with one E for now.

I think ""DEMON"" is a good second guess.

So, second guess: DEMON

But note: we have to output in the format.

<guess>DEMON</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- We must avoid using R, A, I, S since they are eliminated.
- We need to include E (as it is confirmed in the word) but in a new position (not position 5) to test its location.
- We should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D, M) to maximize information gain.

The word ""DEMON"" fits well:
- Includes E in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: D, M, O, N (all untested and frequent in English).
- Avoids eliminated letters (R, A, I, S).

This guess will help identify:
- If E is in position 2 (✓) or elsewhere (-).
- Which of D, M, O, N are present and their positions.

- R: x (not in the word)

- We need to include E (as it is confirmed in the word) but in a new position (not position 5) to test its location.
- We should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D, M) to maximize information gain.

The word ""DEMON"" fits well:
- Includes E in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: D, M, O, N (all untested and frequent in English).
- Avoids eliminated letters (R, A, I, S).

This guess will help identify:
- If E is in position 2 (✓) or elsewhere (-).
- Which of D, M, O, N are present and their positions.",Guess 2: DEMON -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters to maximize information.
Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

A good starting word is often one that has a mix of common vowels and consonants. For example, ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"". I recall that ""RAISE"" is a popular starter because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is another good one. But let's choose ""RAISE"" because it includes the vowel 'I' in addition to 'A' and 'E'. 

So, first guess: RAISE.

But note: We must output in the specified format.

Let me output: 
<guess>RAISE</guess>For the first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants. This helps identify which letters are present in the secret word and their positions. 

I selected ""RAISE"" because:
- It includes 3 common vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).
- Letters like R, S, and E are statistically frequent in English words.
- This combination offers broad coverage to interpret feedback efficiently (e.g., reveals potential ✓, -, or x patterns).

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or S. But it does contain the letter E, but not in the last position.

Therefore, the secret word has the letter E in one of the first four positions (positions 1 to 4, since position 5 is where we had E and it was wrong).

We know the word has E, and we know it doesn't have R, A, I, S.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes E (to try to find its correct position) and
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet (since R, A, I, S are out).

We also avoid using R, A, I, S because they are not in the word.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

We know E is in the word, so we can try to put E in a different position. Since in ""RAISE"" it was at the end (position 5) and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test multiple new letters and also try to place E in a new position.

A good strategy is to use a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters that we haven't eliminated.

Let's think of words that have E and avoid R, A, I, S.

Possible letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Vowels: We know A and I are out, but O and U are still possible.

A good candidate might be a word like ""CLOUD"", but that doesn't have E. We need to include E.

Another idea: ""HOUSE"" but H, O, U, S, E -> but S is out, so not allowed.

We must avoid S.

How about ""THREE""? But that has 5 letters? No, ""THREE"" is 6 letters. We need 5 letters.

Let's think of 5-letter words with E and without R, A, I, S.

Some options:
- ""EVENT"": E, V, E, N, T -> but we have two E's? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know. But we can try. However, we have to consider that the feedback for E was only one occurrence (since we had one E and it was marked as present but wrong position). But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences. So the word might have more than one E? But in our guess, if we use two E's, we might get confusing feedback? Actually, it's okay because the feedback will mark each occurrence.

But we know that at least one E is present. If we use two E's, we might find out if there are two.

But let's avoid complexity for now and try to use one E and four new letters.

We can try to put E at the beginning? For example, words starting with E.

But note: we have to avoid R, A, I, S.

Common words: 
- ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W -> no R,A,I,S.
- ""EJECT"": E, J, E, C, T -> has two E's and J is uncommon.
- ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> no R,A,I,S.

But we also want to cover common letters.

Another idea: ""OUNCE"" -> O, U, N, C, E -> E at the end? But in the first guess, E was at the end and was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put E at the end again, and if the secret word has E at the end, it would be marked as correct (✓). But if it's not at the end, then we get more information.

But we know that E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at the end again, it will still be wrong position? Unless the secret word has two E's? But we don't know.

To maximize information, we should try E in a different position. Since it was at position 5 and wrong, we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let me list some words without R,A,I,S and with E in a different position.

Position 1: 
- ""ELITE"" -> but has I (which is out) and T, E -> I is not allowed because we know I is not in the word.
We must avoid I.

So no I.

Position 1: 
- ""EJECT"" -> has E, J, E, C, T -> but J is uncommon and we have two E's.
- ""EVERY"" -> has R (out) and Y.
- ""EXERT"" -> has R and X.

Avoid R.

Better: ""EVENT"" -> E, V, E, N, T -> has two E's and V, N, T. But we can use it? We don't know if V, N, T are in the word.

But we are trying to test new letters.

Another: ""ENEMY"" -> E, N, E, M, Y -> two E's and N, M, Y.

But Y is less common.

""OUNCE"" has E at the end, which we know is wrong. So if we put E at the end again, we might not get new information about E's position. But we can test other letters.

Alternatively, we can put E at position 1: ""EDGED"" -> two E's and D, G -> but G and D are good, but two E's and repeated D? Not ideal.

""ETHIC"" -> has H, C, but also I (which is out) -> invalid because I is not in the word and we can't use it.

We must use only letters that are not eliminated? No, we can use any letters, but we know that R, A, I, S are not in the word, so using them would be wasteful because they will be marked as x and we get no new information. So we should avoid using R, A, I, S.

So, back to ""ELBOW"": E (position1), L, B, O, W. This uses E in position 1 and new letters: L, B, O, W.

Another option: ""MEDLEY"" -> 6 letters, too long.

""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. This is good because we are trying E in a new position (position 2). And letters B, L, O, W are new.

Similarly, ""GLOBE"": G, L, O, B, E -> E at the end, which we know is wrong.

So ""BELOW"" seems better because E is in position 2.

Another candidate: ""CELLO"" -> C, E, L, L, O -> but has two L's? And E at position 2. But we can use it? However, repeated letters might not be ideal for information.

""BLOKE"": B, L, O, K, E -> E at the end, same as before.

""DEMON"": D, E, M, O, N -> E at position 2, and letters D, M, O, N.

This seems good: common letters D, M, O, N.

Similarly, ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> E at position 2, but L is also common.

But we have to choose one.

We also have to consider that we are trying to find the position of E.

Since E was not at position 5, and we try it at position 2, if it is correct, we get a ✓. If not, we know it's not at 2, and we can try other positions.

Moreover, we get information about D, M, O, N.

So ""DEMON"" is a good candidate.

Another one: ""HONEY"" -> H, O, N, E, Y -> E at position 4. That's also a new position.

But Y is less common.

""POUND"" -> no E, so not useful.

""FLOUT"" -> no E.

So between ""BELOW"", ""DEMON"", ""HONEY"", I think ""DEMON"" is better because it has more common consonants.

We can also consider ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D -> E at position 4. This is also good.

But let's choose one that has E in a position we haven't tried. We tried position 5, so positions 1,2,3,4 are open.

I think ""DEMON"" is a solid choice.

But note: we are not sure if the word has any of these letters, but we are trying to cover ground.

Another word: ""MOUNT"" -> no E.

""COULD"" -> no E.

So I'll go with ""DEMON"".

But let me confirm: D, E, M, O, N. No R, A, I, S. E is at position 2.

We can also consider ""BONEY"" -> B, O, N, E, Y -> but Y is less common.

""CONED"" -> C, O, N, E, D -> E at position 4.

But ""DEMON"" is a common word.

Alternatively, ""EVENT"" has two E's, which might be useful? But we don't know if there are two E's.

But let's stick with one E for now.

I think ""DEMON"" is a good second guess.

So, second guess: DEMON

But note: we have to output in the format.

<guess>DEMON</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- We must avoid using R, A, I, S since they are eliminated.
- We need to include E (as it is confirmed in the word) but in a new position (not position 5) to test its location.
- We should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D, M) to maximize information gain.

The word ""DEMON"" fits well:
- Includes E in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: D, M, O, N (all untested and frequent in English).
- Avoids eliminated letters (R, A, I, S).

This guess will help identify:
- If E is in position 2 (✓) or elsewhere (-).
- Which of D, M, O, N are present and their positions.

We are given two pieces of feedback:

First guess: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
This means:
- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word at all.
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed at position 5).

Second guess: DEMON -> D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x)
So:
- D is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2)
- M is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4)
- N is not in the word (x)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

Eliminated letters (not in secret word): R, A, I, S, D, M, N
(From Guess 1: R, A, I, S; from Guess 2: D, M, N)

Confirmed letters in the word: E and O
- E is in the word but not in position 2 or 5 (from Guess 1 E was guessed at position 5, not correct; Guess 2 at position 2, not correct). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (from Guess 2, where it was at position 4). So O is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need to guess a word that:
- Contains E and O (since both are confirmed)
- Avoids eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, D, M, N
- We must consider possible positions for E and O.

Also, we should try to deduce the positions.

For E: Must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).
For O: Must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4).

Now, let's think of common 5-letter words with E and O, avoiding eliminated letters.

Eliminated: R, A, I, S, D, M, N

Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and E (but E and O are already included).

We need to use E and O, and three other letters from the available set.

But note: We also want to test new letters to gain more information.

Possible words:

First, considering E position and O position.

Let's list words that have E and O.

For example, ""PROBE"" but has R (out) and P, B, E? R is eliminated.

""CLOSE"" but has S (out).

""NOTE"" but N is out, and it's only 4 letters? 5-letter words.

""STORE"" has S (out) and R (out).

""HOUSE"" has S (out).

""LOUSE"" has S (out) and L? L is available.

L is available, so perhaps we can use words with L.

""LOTUS"" but has S (out).

""POWER"" has R (out).

""BOXER"" has R and X? But R is out.

Let's avoid R.

""OUNCE"" has N (out) and C, E? N is eliminated.

""OZONE"" has two O's and Z? Z is rare.

""EBONY"" has B, O, N (N is out), Y? N is eliminated.

""FORGE"" has F, O, R (R out), G, E.

R is out.

""BOULE"" has B, O, U, L, E. No eliminated letters? Letters: B, O, U, L, E. Avoids R,A,I,S,D,M,N. So this is possible. And E at position 5? But wait, from first guess, E cannot be at position 5? We have E in ""RAISE"" at position 5 marked as (-) meaning present but wrong position, so position 5 is wrong for E. Then in ""DEMON"" E was at position 2 marked (-), so also wrong.

So E cannot be at position 5 or 2.

What about ""BOULE""? B-O-U-L-E. So E at position 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5 because it was tried and wrong. So if we guess ""BOULE"" and put E at position 5, it will be wrong again.

So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

Similarly, we must put E at 1, 3, or 4.

In ""BOULE"" E is at 5, so not good.

Another word: ""BELOW"" but has E at position 2? In guess 2 we had DEMON with E at position 2 marked as wrong position. So if E is at 2, it would be wrong again? Unless the position is correct, but we know from DEMON that position 2 is wrong for E.

So E can't be at 2 or 5.

So E must be at 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, for O, we know it can't be at 4 (from DEMON).

Now, let's think of words that have E and O, with O not at 4, and E at 1,3, or 4.

Position possibilities:

- If E at position 1: then the word starts with E.
- If E at position 3: E in the middle.
- If E at position 4: fourth letter is E.

And O can be at 1,2,3,5.

But note we have to avoid contradictions.

For example, if E is at position 1, then O cannot be at position 1? Because only one letter per position. So O must be at 2,3, or 5.

Similarly for other positions.

Now, let's list possible words:

First, E at position 1:

Words like: E _ _ _ _, with O somewhere and avoiding eliminated letters.

For example: ""ELECT"" but has L,E,C,T? But ""ELECT"" has two E's? E, L, E, C, T? But position 1 and 3 are E? But we don't know if double E is allowed. But also, C and T are available.

But O is missing? We need O in the word.

So must include O.

""EBOOK"" but B,O,O,K? Two O's? And K. But O must be present? We have O, but let's see if it fits. Also, ""EBOOK"" is a valid word? Yes. E at position1, B at 2, O at 3, O at 4, K at 5? But O at position4? We know from DEMON that O is not at position4? Because in DEMON, O was at position4 and marked ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not at position4. So it can be at other positions.

But ""EBOOK"" has O at position3 and position4. Position4 O is the same as what we guessed? We guessed O at position4 in DEMON and it was wrong position. But if the secret word has two O's, then O could be at position4? The feedback system: for each letter, it considers if that position is correct or if the letter exists elsewhere.

In DEMON, position4 had O and it was marked ""-"", meaning that O is in the word but not at position4. This does not preclude the word having multiple O's, but at position4 it is not O. So if the secret word has two O's, and one is at position4, it might have been marked correctly? But according to the rules, it would be marked ✓ only if exactly in the position. Since it was marked ""-"", it means that position4 is not O, and there is at least one O elsewhere.

So in ""EBOOK"", O is at position3 and position4. If we use it as a guess, and if the secret word has O at position4, it would be marked ✓ for that position? But we don't know if O is at position4 or not.

From DEMON feedback, O is not at position4 because it was marked as ""-"", meaning it is present but not at that position. So secretly, O cannot be at position4; it must be in a different position.

Therefore, in any guess, we should not put O at position4.

Similarly, for E, we should not put it at position2 or 5.

So back to E at position1: ""EBOOK""? E at1, O at3 and4. But position4 O is not allowed because we know O is not at position4. So putting O at position4 would be wasteful and will be marked as wrong position if the secret word has only one O? But we don't know if it has multiple O's.

But since we know that position4 is not O (from feedback), we should avoid putting O at position4 to save a slot.

So in ""EBOOK"", position4 has O, which we know cannot be correct, so that would likely be ""-"" or even ""x"" if there's only one O? But it doesn't help us much.

Better to choose a word where O is in a position we haven't tested.

Similarly for E.

Available positions for E: 1,3,4
For O: 1,2,3,5 (not 4)

Possible positions:

Case: E at 1, O at 2: E O _ _ _
With letters avoiding eliminated ones.

Words: ""EOYEʉ"" not a word.

""EOLITE"" has I (out).

Not common.

E at 1, O at 3: E _ O _ _
Example: ""ETHOS"" but has H, S (S out).

""EXPOS"" has S and X? S out.

""ELOPS"" not common.

Perhaps E at 1 and O at 5: E _ _ _ O
Words: ""EMAIL"" has A (out) and I.

""EBOLA"" has A (out) and L.

""ECHO"" is 4 letters? ""ECLAT"" has A.

5-letter words: ""ERGOT"" has R out.

""EMBOW"" but M out.

Difficult.

E at 1, O at 5: E _ _ _ O
And avoid A, I, R, S, D, M, N.

Available: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y

So, for example, ""EBURO"" not a word.

""ECOLO"" not.

""EVER O"" 6 letters.

""ECHOO"" not standard.

""EER O"" not.

Perhaps ""EUROS"" but has S out.

Hard to find.

Now, E at 3: _ _ E _ _

With O somewhere.

E at 3, O at 1: O _ E _ _
Words: ""OWEre"" not.

""OP e a"" not.

""OAKED"" has A and K, D? D out, A out.

""OBELI"" has I out.

""OCEAN"" has A and C, E? A out.

""OCREA"" not common.

E at 3, O at 2: _ O E _ _
Words: ""BOWEL"" has B, O, W, E, L -> O at 2, E at 3? Positions:1:B,2:O,3:W,4:E,5:L? No, E is at 4, not 3.

""BOXEN"" has N out.

""COVET"" has C, O, V, E, T -> O at 2, E at 4? Not at 3.

If E at position 3, then _ _ E _ _

With O at 2: _ O E _ _

or O at 1: O _ E _ _

or O at 5: _ _ E _ O

 Etc.

Word like ""TOPIC"" has I and no E.

""LOVES"" has S out.

""ROLEX"" has R out.

""FOG EY"" not.

""BOGLE"" has B, O, G, L, E -> positions:1:B,2:O,3:G,4:L,5:E -> E at 5, which we cannot.

But we seel E at 3.

""POWER"" has R out.

""POVEL"" not common.

""JOKED"" has D out.

""JOKE"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""TOKED"" has D out.

This is challenging.

E at position 4: _ _ _ E _

With O somewhere.

For example, O at 1: O _ _ E _

Or O at 2: _ O _ E _

Or O at 3: _ _ O E _

Or O at 5: _ _ _ E O

And avoid eliminated letters.

Available letters include B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y

For instance, ""USED"" has S, D out.

""PAGED"" has A, G, E, D? D out.

""A"" is out.

""OLE  "" not.

""OPEN  "" not.

"" OKE E"" not.

""BUOYE"" not.

""OWLET"" has O, W, L, E, T -> positions:1:O,2:W,3:L,4:E,5:T -> E at position 4, which is possible (E can be at 4). O at position 1.

Similarly, ""BOW E"" not.

""OWLET"" is a word: a small owl. Yes, valid.

Letters: O, W, L, E, T. All available? O, W, L, E, T. Avoids R,A,I,S,D,M,N.

E is at position 4, which is allowed (position 4 possible for E).

O is at position 1, which is allowed (not position 4).

We are testing O at position 1 and E at position 4.

Additionally, we test new letters W, L, T.

This seems good.

Another candidate: ""O ft E n"" not.

"" OVULE"" but has U, L, E? O, V, U, L, E. E at position 5? Position 5 not allowed for E.

"" OTT E R"" too long.

""OWLET"" seems solid.

Other words with E at 4 and O at 1? ""OFTEN"" has F, T, E, N? N out.

""N"" is eliminated.

""OPERA"" has P, E, R, A? R and A out.

""OKAYE"" not.

So ""OWLET"" is a good choice.

What about E at position 3 and O at position 5? For example, some word like _ _ E _ O

With available letters.

But we don't have an obvious word.

Or E at position 1 and O at position 3, like ""EBOLA"" but A out.

""ECT O"" not a word.

""EPH O"" not.

So ""OWLET"" seems best.

We also cover many new letters: O (at position 1), W, L, E (at position 4), T.

Even if not all are in the word, we gain information.

Another possibility: ""CLOTE"" not a word.

""GLOVE"" has G, L, O, V, E. E at position 5? Not allowed, 5 not for E.

""GLOBE"" E at 5.

""BLORE"" not.

""COULE"" not.

""VOLTE"" has V, O, L, T, E. E at 5? Position: V1, O2, L3, T4, E5 -> E at 5, not allowed.

So ""OWLET"" is good.

Another word: ""POULE"" P, O, U, L, E. E at position 5? Not allowed.

""TOILE"" T, O, I, L, E -> but I is out.

So not.

Or ""HOTEL"" H, O, T, E, L. E at position 4? Positions:1:H,2:O,3:T,4:E,5:L -> E at 4.

But O at position 2, which is new.

Letters H, O, T, E, L.

Avoids all eliminated: R,A,I,S,D,M,N are out.

So ""HOTEL"" has E at position 4, O at position 2.

We haven't tested position 2 for O? In DEMON, O was at position 4 and marked ""-"", but position 2 is new.

Similarly, we tested E at position 5 and 2, not 4.

So ""HOTEL"" is also a possibility.

E at 4 and O at 2.

Another common word with E and O: ""WHOLE"" W,H,O,L,E -> positions:1:W,2:H,3:O,4:L,5:E -> E at 5, not allowed.

""TONEL"" N out.

""BUTlE"" not.

So between ""OWLET"" and ""HOTEL"", both are valid.

""OWLET"" has O at 1, E at 4.
""HOTEL"" has O at 2, E at 4.

We might prefer one that tests a position for E we haven't tried. We tried E at position 5 and 2, so position 4 is new for E.

In both, E is at 4.

For O, we tried O at position 4 (wrong), so position 1 or 2 are new.

""OWLET"" tests O at position 1.
""HOTEL"" tests O at position 2.

Both are good.

But let's see which one has more common letters.

""HOTEL"": H, O, T, E, L
""OWLET"": O, W, L, E, T

""HOTEL"" has H and T, ""OWLET"" has W and T? T in both.

Both have T and L.

But ""HOTEL"" is more common.

We can also consider the feedback possibility.

But since we have no , we can choose either.

I'll go with ""HOTEL"" because it is a very common word.

Or to avoid potential issues with H, but it's fine.

Another word: ""COUPE"" C,O,U,P,E -> E at 5, not allowed.

""TOKER"" R out.

So ""HOTEL"".

But in ""HOTEL"", O is at position 2, which for E we had position 2 marked as wrong in DEMON, but now we are putting O at 2.

That's fine.

So guess: ""HOTEL""

If we do this, feedback will tell us about O at position 2 and E at position 4, and also about H, T, L.

Letters: H, O, T, E, L.

So <guess>HOTEL</guess>

But let's confirm all.

Eliminated letters not used: R,A,I,S,D,M,N not in HOTEL.

E at position 4? HOTEL: 1:H, 2:O, 3:T, 4:E, 5:L -> yes E at 4.

O at position 2.

Both un tested positions for these letters.

Perfect.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From GUESS 1 (RAISE): Letters R, A, I, S are not in the secret word (all marked ""x""). E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").
- From GUESS 2 (DEMON): Letters D, M, N are not in the secret word (all marked ""x""). E is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-""). O is in the word but not in position 4 (marked ""-"").

Consolidated known information:
- **Eliminated letters (not in the word)**: R, A, I, S, D, M, N
- **Confirmed present letters**: E and O, with positional constraints:
  - E must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).
  - O must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4).
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new letters to gather more information while incorporating E and O in valid positions. Avoid using eliminated letters.

For this guess:
- Selected ""HOTEL"" (a valid 5-letter word) because:
  - Includes E (position 4) and O (position 2), respecting positional constraints.
  - Tests new common letters (H, T, L) not yet evaluated.
  - Avoids all eliminated letters (R, A, I, S, D, M, N are absent).
- Expected information gain:
  - Confirms if E is in position 4 and O is in position 2.
  - Reveals presence/absence of H, T, L and their positions if present.
- Alternative considered: ""OWLET"" (O in position 1, E in position 4), but ""HOTEL"" was chosen for higher letter frequency coverage.

<guess>HOTEL</guess>",HOTEL,"We are given two pieces of feedback:

First guess: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
This means:
- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word at all.
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed at position 5).

Second guess: DEMON -> D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x)
So:
- D is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2)
- M is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4)
- N is not in the word (x)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

Eliminated letters (not in secret word): R, A, I, S, D, M, N
(From Guess 1: R, A, I, S; from Guess 2: D, M, N)

Confirmed letters in the word: E and O
- E is in the word but not in position 2 or 5 (from Guess 1 E was guessed at position 5, not correct; Guess 2 at position 2, not correct). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (from Guess 2, where it was at position 4). So O is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need to guess a word that:
- Contains E and O (since both are confirmed)
- Avoids eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, D, M, N
- We must consider possible positions for E and O.

Also, we should try to deduce the positions.

For E: Must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).
For O: Must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4).

Now, let's think of common 5-letter words with E and O, avoiding eliminated letters.

Eliminated: R, A, I, S, D, M, N

Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and E (but E and O are already included).

We need to use E and O, and three other letters from the available set.

But note: We also want to test new letters to gain more information.

Possible words:

First, considering E position and O position.

Let's list words that have E and O.

For example, ""PROBE"" but has R (out) and P, B, E? R is eliminated.

""CLOSE"" but has S (out).

""NOTE"" but N is out, and it's only 4 letters? 5-letter words.

""STORE"" has S (out) and R (out).

""HOUSE"" has S (out).

""LOUSE"" has S (out) and L? L is available.

L is available, so perhaps we can use words with L.

""LOTUS"" but has S (out).

""POWER"" has R (out).

""BOXER"" has R and X? But R is out.

Let's avoid R.

""OUNCE"" has N (out) and C, E? N is eliminated.

""OZONE"" has two O's and Z? Z is rare.

""EBONY"" has B, O, N (N is out), Y? N is eliminated.

""FORGE"" has F, O, R (R out), G, E.

R is out.

""BOULE"" has B, O, U, L, E. No eliminated letters? Letters: B, O, U, L, E. Avoids R,A,I,S,D,M,N. So this is possible. And E at position 5? But wait, from first guess, E cannot be at position 5? We have E in ""RAISE"" at position 5 marked as (-) meaning present but wrong position, so position 5 is wrong for E. Then in ""DEMON"" E was at position 2 marked (-), so also wrong.

So E cannot be at position 5 or 2.

What about ""BOULE""? B-O-U-L-E. So E at position 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5 because it was tried and wrong. So if we guess ""BOULE"" and put E at position 5, it will be wrong again.

So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

Similarly, we must put E at 1, 3, or 4.

In ""BOULE"" E is at 5, so not good.

Another word: ""BELOW"" but has E at position 2? In guess 2 we had DEMON with E at position 2 marked as wrong position. So if E is at 2, it would be wrong again? Unless the position is correct, but we know from DEMON that position 2 is wrong for E.

So E can't be at 2 or 5.

So E must be at 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, for O, we know it can't be at 4 (from DEMON).

Now, let's think of words that have E and O, with O not at 4, and E at 1,3, or 4.

Position possibilities:

- If E at position 1: then the word starts with E.
- If E at position 3: E in the middle.
- If E at position 4: fourth letter is E.

And O can be at 1,2,3,5.

But note we have to avoid contradictions.

For example, if E is at position 1, then O cannot be at position 1? Because only one letter per position. So O must be at 2,3, or 5.

Similarly for other positions.

Now, let's list possible words:

First, E at position 1:

Words like: E _ _ _ _, with O somewhere and avoiding eliminated letters.

For example: ""ELECT"" but has L,E,C,T? But ""ELECT"" has two E's? E, L, E, C, T? But position 1 and 3 are E? But we don't know if double E is allowed. But also, C and T are available.

But O is missing? We need O in the word.

So must include O.

""EBOOK"" but B,O,O,K? Two O's? And K. But O must be present? We have O, but let's see if it fits. Also, ""EBOOK"" is a valid word? Yes. E at position1, B at 2, O at 3, O at 4, K at 5? But O at position4? We know from DEMON that O is not at position4? Because in DEMON, O was at position4 and marked ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not at position4. So it can be at other positions.

But ""EBOOK"" has O at position3 and position4. Position4 O is the same as what we guessed? We guessed O at position4 in DEMON and it was wrong position. But if the secret word has two O's, then O could be at position4? The feedback system: for each letter, it considers if that position is correct or if the letter exists elsewhere.

In DEMON, position4 had O and it was marked ""-"", meaning that O is in the word but not at position4. This does not preclude the word having multiple O's, but at position4 it is not O. So if the secret word has two O's, and one is at position4, it might have been marked correctly? But according to the rules, it would be marked ✓ only if exactly in the position. Since it was marked ""-"", it means that position4 is not O, and there is at least one O elsewhere.

So in ""EBOOK"", O is at position3 and position4. If we use it as a guess, and if the secret word has O at position4, it would be marked ✓ for that position? But we don't know if O is at position4 or not.

From DEMON feedback, O is not at position4 because it was marked as ""-"", meaning it is present but not at that position. So secretly, O cannot be at position4; it must be in a different position.

Therefore, in any guess, we should not put O at position4.

Similarly, for E, we should not put it at position2 or 5.

So back to E at position1: ""EBOOK""? E at1, O at3 and4. But position4 O is not allowed because we know O is not at position4. So putting O at position4 would be wasteful and will be marked as wrong position if the secret word has only one O? But we don't know if it has multiple O's.

But since we know that position4 is not O (from feedback), we should avoid putting O at position4 to save a slot.

So in ""EBOOK"", position4 has O, which we know cannot be correct, so that would likely be ""-"" or even ""x"" if there's only one O? But it doesn't help us much.

Better to choose a word where O is in a position we haven't tested.

Similarly for E.

Available positions for E: 1,3,4
For O: 1,2,3,5 (not 4)

Possible positions:

Case: E at 1, O at 2: E O _ _ _
With letters avoiding eliminated ones.

Words: ""EOYEʉ"" not a word.

""EOLITE"" has I (out).

Not common.

E at 1, O at 3: E _ O _ _
Example: ""ETHOS"" but has H, S (S out).

""EXPOS"" has S and X? S out.

""ELOPS"" not common.

Perhaps E at 1 and O at 5: E _ _ _ O
Words: ""EMAIL"" has A (out) and I.

""EBOLA"" has A (out) and L.

""ECHO"" is 4 letters? ""ECLAT"" has A.

5-letter words: ""ERGOT"" has R out.

""EMBOW"" but M out.

Difficult.

E at 1, O at 5: E _ _ _ O
And avoid A, I, R, S, D, M, N.

Available: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y

So, for example, ""EBURO"" not a word.

""ECOLO"" not.

""EVER O"" 6 letters.

""ECHOO"" not standard.

""EER O"" not.

Perhaps ""EUROS"" but has S out.

Hard to find.

Now, E at 3: _ _ E _ _

With O somewhere.

E at 3, O at 1: O _ E _ _
Words: ""OWEre"" not.

""OP e a"" not.

""OAKED"" has A and K, D? D out, A out.

""OBELI"" has I out.

""OCEAN"" has A and C, E? A out.

""OCREA"" not common.

E at 3, O at 2: _ O E _ _
Words: ""BOWEL"" has B, O, W, E, L -> O at 2, E at 3? Positions:1:B,2:O,3:W,4:E,5:L? No, E is at 4, not 3.

""BOXEN"" has N out.

""COVET"" has C, O, V, E, T -> O at 2, E at 4? Not at 3.

If E at position 3, then _ _ E _ _

With O at 2: _ O E _ _

or O at 1: O _ E _ _

or O at 5: _ _ E _ O

 Etc.

Word like ""TOPIC"" has I and no E.

""LOVES"" has S out.

""ROLEX"" has R out.

""FOG EY"" not.

""BOGLE"" has B, O, G, L, E -> positions:1:B,2:O,3:G,4:L,5:E -> E at 5, which we cannot.

But we seel E at 3.

""POWER"" has R out.

""POVEL"" not common.

""JOKED"" has D out.

""JOKE"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""TOKED"" has D out.

This is challenging.

E at position 4: _ _ _ E _

With O somewhere.

For example, O at 1: O _ _ E _

Or O at 2: _ O _ E _

Or O at 3: _ _ O E _

Or O at 5: _ _ _ E O

And avoid eliminated letters.

Available letters include B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y

For instance, ""USED"" has S, D out.

""PAGED"" has A, G, E, D? D out.

""A"" is out.

""OLE  "" not.

""OPEN  "" not.

"" OKE E"" not.

""BUOYE"" not.

""OWLET"" has O, W, L, E, T -> positions:1:O,2:W,3:L,4:E,5:T -> E at position 4, which is possible (E can be at 4). O at position 1.

Similarly, ""BOW E"" not.

""OWLET"" is a word: a small owl. Yes, valid.

Letters: O, W, L, E, T. All available? O, W, L, E, T. Avoids R,A,I,S,D,M,N.

E is at position 4, which is allowed (position 4 possible for E).

O is at position 1, which is allowed (not position 4).

We are testing O at position 1 and E at position 4.

Additionally, we test new letters W, L, T.

This seems good.

Another candidate: ""O ft E n"" not.

"" OVULE"" but has U, L, E? O, V, U, L, E. E at position 5? Position 5 not allowed for E.

"" OTT E R"" too long.

""OWLET"" seems solid.

Other words with E at 4 and O at 1? ""OFTEN"" has F, T, E, N? N out.

""N"" is eliminated.

""OPERA"" has P, E, R, A? R and A out.

""OKAYE"" not.

So ""OWLET"" is a good choice.

What about E at position 3 and O at position 5? For example, some word like _ _ E _ O

With available letters.

But we don't have an obvious word.

Or E at position 1 and O at position 3, like ""EBOLA"" but A out.

""ECT O"" not a word.

""EPH O"" not.

So ""OWLET"" seems best.

We also cover many new letters: O (at position 1), W, L, E (at position 4), T.

Even if not all are in the word, we gain information.

Another possibility: ""CLOTE"" not a word.

""GLOVE"" has G, L, O, V, E. E at position 5? Not allowed, 5 not for E.

""GLOBE"" E at 5.

""BLORE"" not.

""COULE"" not.

""VOLTE"" has V, O, L, T, E. E at 5? Position: V1, O2, L3, T4, E5 -> E at 5, not allowed.

So ""OWLET"" is good.

Another word: ""POULE"" P, O, U, L, E. E at position 5? Not allowed.

""TOILE"" T, O, I, L, E -> but I is out.

So not.

Or ""HOTEL"" H, O, T, E, L. E at position 4? Positions:1:H,2:O,3:T,4:E,5:L -> E at 4.

But O at position 2, which is new.

Letters H, O, T, E, L.

Avoids all eliminated: R,A,I,S,D,M,N are out.

So ""HOTEL"" has E at position 4, O at position 2.

We haven't tested position 2 for O? In DEMON, O was at position 4 and marked ""-"", but position 2 is new.

Similarly, we tested E at position 5 and 2, not 4.

So ""HOTEL"" is also a possibility.

E at 4 and O at 2.

Another common word with E and O: ""WHOLE"" W,H,O,L,E -> positions:1:W,2:H,3:O,4:L,5:E -> E at 5, not allowed.

""TONEL"" N out.

""BUTlE"" not.

So between ""OWLET"" and ""HOTEL"", both are valid.

""OWLET"" has O at 1, E at 4.
""HOTEL"" has O at 2, E at 4.

We might prefer one that tests a position for E we haven't tried. We tried E at position 5 and 2, so position 4 is new for E.

In both, E is at 4.

For O, we tried O at position 4 (wrong), so position 1 or 2 are new.

""OWLET"" tests O at position 1.
""HOTEL"" tests O at position 2.

Both are good.

But let's see which one has more common letters.

""HOTEL"": H, O, T, E, L
""OWLET"": O, W, L, E, T

""HOTEL"" has H and T, ""OWLET"" has W and T? T in both.

Both have T and L.

But ""HOTEL"" is more common.

We can also consider the feedback possibility.

But since we have no , we can choose either.

I'll go with ""HOTEL"" because it is a very common word.

Or to avoid potential issues with H, but it's fine.

Another word: ""COUPE"" C,O,U,P,E -> E at 5, not allowed.

""TOKER"" R out.

So ""HOTEL"".

But in ""HOTEL"", O is at position 2, which for E we had position 2 marked as wrong in DEMON, but now we are putting O at 2.

That's fine.

So guess: ""HOTEL""

If we do this, feedback will tell us about O at position 2 and E at position 4, and also about H, T, L.

Letters: H, O, T, E, L.

So <guess>HOTEL</guess>

But let's confirm all.

Eliminated letters not used: R,A,I,S,D,M,N not in HOTEL.

E at position 4? HOTEL: 1:H, 2:O, 3:T, 4:E, 5:L -> yes E at 4.

O at position 2.

Both un tested positions for these letters.

Perfect.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From GUESS 1 (RAISE): Letters R, A, I, S are not in the secret word (all marked ""x""). E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").
- From GUESS 2 (DEMON): Letters D, M, N are not in the secret word (all marked ""x""). E is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-""). O is in the word but not in position 4 (marked ""-"").

Consolidated known information:
- **Eliminated letters (not in the word)**: R, A, I, S, D, M, N
- **Confirmed present letters**: E and O, with positional constraints:
  - E must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).
  - O must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4).
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new letters to gather more information while incorporating E and O in valid positions. Avoid using eliminated letters.

For this guess:
- Selected ""HOTEL"" (a valid 5-letter word) because:
  - Includes E (position 4) and O (position 2), respecting positional constraints.
  - Tests new common letters (H, T, L) not yet evaluated.
  - Avoids all eliminated letters (R, A, I, S, D, M, N are absent).
- Expected information gain:
  - Confirms if E is in position 4 and O is in position 2.
  - Reveals presence/absence of H, T, L and their positions if present.
- Alternative considered: ""OWLET"" (O in position 1, E in position 4), but ""HOTEL"" was chosen for higher letter frequency coverage.",Guess 3: HOTEL -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) L(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters to maximize information.
Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

A good starting word is often one that has a mix of common vowels and consonants. For example, ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"". I recall that ""RAISE"" is a popular starter because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is another good one. But let's choose ""RAISE"" because it includes the vowel 'I' in addition to 'A' and 'E'. 

So, first guess: RAISE.

But note: We must output in the specified format.

Let me output: 
<guess>RAISE</guess>For the first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants. This helps identify which letters are present in the secret word and their positions. 

I selected ""RAISE"" because:
- It includes 3 common vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).
- Letters like R, S, and E are statistically frequent in English words.
- This combination offers broad coverage to interpret feedback efficiently (e.g., reveals potential ✓, -, or x patterns).

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or S. But it does contain the letter E, but not in the last position.

Therefore, the secret word has the letter E in one of the first four positions (positions 1 to 4, since position 5 is where we had E and it was wrong).

We know the word has E, and we know it doesn't have R, A, I, S.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes E (to try to find its correct position) and
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet (since R, A, I, S are out).

We also avoid using R, A, I, S because they are not in the word.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

We know E is in the word, so we can try to put E in a different position. Since in ""RAISE"" it was at the end (position 5) and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test multiple new letters and also try to place E in a new position.

A good strategy is to use a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters that we haven't eliminated.

Let's think of words that have E and avoid R, A, I, S.

Possible letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Vowels: We know A and I are out, but O and U are still possible.

A good candidate might be a word like ""CLOUD"", but that doesn't have E. We need to include E.

Another idea: ""HOUSE"" but H, O, U, S, E -> but S is out, so not allowed.

We must avoid S.

How about ""THREE""? But that has 5 letters? No, ""THREE"" is 6 letters. We need 5 letters.

Let's think of 5-letter words with E and without R, A, I, S.

Some options:
- ""EVENT"": E, V, E, N, T -> but we have two E's? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know. But we can try. However, we have to consider that the feedback for E was only one occurrence (since we had one E and it was marked as present but wrong position). But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences. So the word might have more than one E? But in our guess, if we use two E's, we might get confusing feedback? Actually, it's okay because the feedback will mark each occurrence.

But we know that at least one E is present. If we use two E's, we might find out if there are two.

But let's avoid complexity for now and try to use one E and four new letters.

We can try to put E at the beginning? For example, words starting with E.

But note: we have to avoid R, A, I, S.

Common words: 
- ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W -> no R,A,I,S.
- ""EJECT"": E, J, E, C, T -> has two E's and J is uncommon.
- ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> no R,A,I,S.

But we also want to cover common letters.

Another idea: ""OUNCE"" -> O, U, N, C, E -> E at the end? But in the first guess, E was at the end and was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put E at the end again, and if the secret word has E at the end, it would be marked as correct (✓). But if it's not at the end, then we get more information.

But we know that E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at the end again, it will still be wrong position? Unless the secret word has two E's? But we don't know.

To maximize information, we should try E in a different position. Since it was at position 5 and wrong, we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let me list some words without R,A,I,S and with E in a different position.

Position 1: 
- ""ELITE"" -> but has I (which is out) and T, E -> I is not allowed because we know I is not in the word.
We must avoid I.

So no I.

Position 1: 
- ""EJECT"" -> has E, J, E, C, T -> but J is uncommon and we have two E's.
- ""EVERY"" -> has R (out) and Y.
- ""EXERT"" -> has R and X.

Avoid R.

Better: ""EVENT"" -> E, V, E, N, T -> has two E's and V, N, T. But we can use it? We don't know if V, N, T are in the word.

But we are trying to test new letters.

Another: ""ENEMY"" -> E, N, E, M, Y -> two E's and N, M, Y.

But Y is less common.

""OUNCE"" has E at the end, which we know is wrong. So if we put E at the end again, we might not get new information about E's position. But we can test other letters.

Alternatively, we can put E at position 1: ""EDGED"" -> two E's and D, G -> but G and D are good, but two E's and repeated D? Not ideal.

""ETHIC"" -> has H, C, but also I (which is out) -> invalid because I is not in the word and we can't use it.

We must use only letters that are not eliminated? No, we can use any letters, but we know that R, A, I, S are not in the word, so using them would be wasteful because they will be marked as x and we get no new information. So we should avoid using R, A, I, S.

So, back to ""ELBOW"": E (position1), L, B, O, W. This uses E in position 1 and new letters: L, B, O, W.

Another option: ""MEDLEY"" -> 6 letters, too long.

""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. This is good because we are trying E in a new position (position 2). And letters B, L, O, W are new.

Similarly, ""GLOBE"": G, L, O, B, E -> E at the end, which we know is wrong.

So ""BELOW"" seems better because E is in position 2.

Another candidate: ""CELLO"" -> C, E, L, L, O -> but has two L's? And E at position 2. But we can use it? However, repeated letters might not be ideal for information.

""BLOKE"": B, L, O, K, E -> E at the end, same as before.

""DEMON"": D, E, M, O, N -> E at position 2, and letters D, M, O, N.

This seems good: common letters D, M, O, N.

Similarly, ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> E at position 2, but L is also common.

But we have to choose one.

We also have to consider that we are trying to find the position of E.

Since E was not at position 5, and we try it at position 2, if it is correct, we get a ✓. If not, we know it's not at 2, and we can try other positions.

Moreover, we get information about D, M, O, N.

So ""DEMON"" is a good candidate.

Another one: ""HONEY"" -> H, O, N, E, Y -> E at position 4. That's also a new position.

But Y is less common.

""POUND"" -> no E, so not useful.

""FLOUT"" -> no E.

So between ""BELOW"", ""DEMON"", ""HONEY"", I think ""DEMON"" is better because it has more common consonants.

We can also consider ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D -> E at position 4. This is also good.

But let's choose one that has E in a position we haven't tried. We tried position 5, so positions 1,2,3,4 are open.

I think ""DEMON"" is a solid choice.

But note: we are not sure if the word has any of these letters, but we are trying to cover ground.

Another word: ""MOUNT"" -> no E.

""COULD"" -> no E.

So I'll go with ""DEMON"".

But let me confirm: D, E, M, O, N. No R, A, I, S. E is at position 2.

We can also consider ""BONEY"" -> B, O, N, E, Y -> but Y is less common.

""CONED"" -> C, O, N, E, D -> E at position 4.

But ""DEMON"" is a common word.

Alternatively, ""EVENT"" has two E's, which might be useful? But we don't know if there are two E's.

But let's stick with one E for now.

I think ""DEMON"" is a good second guess.

So, second guess: DEMON

But note: we have to output in the format.

<guess>DEMON</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- We must avoid using R, A, I, S since they are eliminated.
- We need to include E (as it is confirmed in the word) but in a new position (not position 5) to test its location.
- We should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D, M) to maximize information gain.

The word ""DEMON"" fits well:
- Includes E in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: D, M, O, N (all untested and frequent in English).
- Avoids eliminated letters (R, A, I, S).

This guess will help identify:
- If E is in position 2 (✓) or elsewhere (-).
- Which of D, M, O, N are present and their positions.

<guess>DEMON</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: DEMON -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given two pieces of feedback:

First guess: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
This means:
- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word at all.
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed at position 5).

Second guess: DEMON -> D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x)
So:
- D is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2)
- M is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4)
- N is not in the word (x)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

Eliminated letters (not in secret word): R, A, I, S, D, M, N
(From Guess 1: R, A, I, S; from Guess 2: D, M, N)

Confirmed letters in the word: E and O
- E is in the word but not in position 2 or 5 (from Guess 1 E was guessed at position 5, not correct; Guess 2 at position 2, not correct). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (from Guess 2, where it was at position 4). So O is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need to guess a word that:
- Contains E and O (since both are confirmed)
- Avoids eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, D, M, N
- We must consider possible positions for E and O.

Also, we should try to deduce the positions.

For E: Must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).
For O: Must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4).

Now, let's think of common 5-letter words with E and O, avoiding eliminated letters.

Eliminated: R, A, I, S, D, M, N

Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and E (but E and O are already included).

We need to use E and O, and three other letters from the available set.

But note: We also want to test new letters to gain more information.

Possible words:

First, considering E position and O position.

Let's list words that have E and O.

For example, ""PROBE"" but has R (out) and P, B, E? R is eliminated.

""CLOSE"" but has S (out).

""NOTE"" but N is out, and it's only 4 letters? 5-letter words.

""STORE"" has S (out) and R (out).

""HOUSE"" has S (out).

""LOUSE"" has S (out) and L? L is available.

L is available, so perhaps we can use words with L.

""LOTUS"" but has S (out).

""POWER"" has R (out).

""BOXER"" has R and X? But R is out.

Let's avoid R.

""OUNCE"" has N (out) and C, E? N is eliminated.

""OZONE"" has two O's and Z? Z is rare.

""EBONY"" has B, O, N (N is out), Y? N is eliminated.

""FORGE"" has F, O, R (R out), G, E.

R is out.

""BOULE"" has B, O, U, L, E. No eliminated letters? Letters: B, O, U, L, E. Avoids R,A,I,S,D,M,N. So this is possible. And E at position 5? But wait, from first guess, E cannot be at position 5? We have E in ""RAISE"" at position 5 marked as (-) meaning present but wrong position, so position 5 is wrong for E. Then in ""DEMON"" E was at position 2 marked (-), so also wrong.

So E cannot be at position 5 or 2.

What about ""BOULE""? B-O-U-L-E. So E at position 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5 because it was tried and wrong. So if we guess ""BOULE"" and put E at position 5, it will be wrong again.

So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

Similarly, we must put E at 1, 3, or 4.

In ""BOULE"" E is at 5, so not good.

Another word: ""BELOW"" but has E at position 2? In guess 2 we had DEMON with E at position 2 marked as wrong position. So if E is at 2, it would be wrong again? Unless the position is correct, but we know from DEMON that position 2 is wrong for E.

So E can't be at 2 or 5.

So E must be at 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, for O, we know it can't be at 4 (from DEMON).

Now, let's think of words that have E and O, with O not at 4, and E at 1,3, or 4.

Position possibilities:

- If E at position 1: then the word starts with E.
- If E at position 3: E in the middle.
- If E at position 4: fourth letter is E.

And O can be at 1,2,3,5.

But note we have to avoid contradictions.

For example, if E is at position 1, then O cannot be at position 1? Because only one letter per position. So O must be at 2,3, or 5.

Similarly for other positions.

Now, let's list possible words:

First, E at position 1:

Words like: E _ _ _ _, with O somewhere and avoiding eliminated letters.

For example: ""ELECT"" but has L,E,C,T? But ""ELECT"" has two E's? E, L, E, C, T? But position 1 and 3 are E? But we don't know if double E is allowed. But also, C and T are available.

But O is missing? We need O in the word.

So must include O.

""EBOOK"" but B,O,O,K? Two O's? And K. But O must be present? We have O, but let's see if it fits. Also, ""EBOOK"" is a valid word? Yes. E at position1, B at 2, O at 3, O at 4, K at 5? But O at position4? We know from DEMON that O is not at position4? Because in DEMON, O was at position4 and marked ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not at position4. So it can be at other positions.

But ""EBOOK"" has O at position3 and position4. Position4 O is the same as what we guessed? We guessed O at position4 in DEMON and it was wrong position. But if the secret word has two O's, then O could be at position4? The feedback system: for each letter, it considers if that position is correct or if the letter exists elsewhere.

In DEMON, position4 had O and it was marked ""-"", meaning that O is in the word but not at position4. This does not preclude the word having multiple O's, but at position4 it is not O. So if the secret word has two O's, and one is at position4, it might have been marked correctly? But according to the rules, it would be marked ✓ only if exactly in the position. Since it was marked ""-"", it means that position4 is not O, and there is at least one O elsewhere.

So in ""EBOOK"", O is at position3 and position4. If we use it as a guess, and if the secret word has O at position4, it would be marked ✓ for that position? But we don't know if O is at position4 or not.

From DEMON feedback, O is not at position4 because it was marked as ""-"", meaning it is present but not at that position. So secretly, O cannot be at position4; it must be in a different position.

Therefore, in any guess, we should not put O at position4.

Similarly, for E, we should not put it at position2 or 5.

So back to E at position1: ""EBOOK""? E at1, O at3 and4. But position4 O is not allowed because we know O is not at position4. So putting O at position4 would be wasteful and will be marked as wrong position if the secret word has only one O? But we don't know if it has multiple O's.

But since we know that position4 is not O (from feedback), we should avoid putting O at position4 to save a slot.

So in ""EBOOK"", position4 has O, which we know cannot be correct, so that would likely be ""-"" or even ""x"" if there's only one O? But it doesn't help us much.

Better to choose a word where O is in a position we haven't tested.

Similarly for E.

Available positions for E: 1,3,4
For O: 1,2,3,5 (not 4)

Possible positions:

Case: E at 1, O at 2: E O _ _ _
With letters avoiding eliminated ones.

Words: ""EOYEʉ"" not a word.

""EOLITE"" has I (out).

Not common.

E at 1, O at 3: E _ O _ _
Example: ""ETHOS"" but has H, S (S out).

""EXPOS"" has S and X? S out.

""ELOPS"" not common.

Perhaps E at 1 and O at 5: E _ _ _ O
Words: ""EMAIL"" has A (out) and I.

""EBOLA"" has A (out) and L.

""ECHO"" is 4 letters? ""ECLAT"" has A.

5-letter words: ""ERGOT"" has R out.

""EMBOW"" but M out.

Difficult.

E at 1, O at 5: E _ _ _ O
And avoid A, I, R, S, D, M, N.

Available: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y

So, for example, ""EBURO"" not a word.

""ECOLO"" not.

""EVER O"" 6 letters.

""ECHOO"" not standard.

""EER O"" not.

Perhaps ""EUROS"" but has S out.

Hard to find.

Now, E at 3: _ _ E _ _

With O somewhere.

E at 3, O at 1: O _ E _ _
Words: ""OWEre"" not.

""OP e a"" not.

""OAKED"" has A and K, D? D out, A out.

""OBELI"" has I out.

""OCEAN"" has A and C, E? A out.

""OCREA"" not common.

E at 3, O at 2: _ O E _ _
Words: ""BOWEL"" has B, O, W, E, L -> O at 2, E at 3? Positions:1:B,2:O,3:W,4:E,5:L? No, E is at 4, not 3.

""BOXEN"" has N out.

""COVET"" has C, O, V, E, T -> O at 2, E at 4? Not at 3.

If E at position 3, then _ _ E _ _

With O at 2: _ O E _ _

or O at 1: O _ E _ _

or O at 5: _ _ E _ O

 Etc.

Word like ""TOPIC"" has I and no E.

""LOVES"" has S out.

""ROLEX"" has R out.

""FOG EY"" not.

""BOGLE"" has B, O, G, L, E -> positions:1:B,2:O,3:G,4:L,5:E -> E at 5, which we cannot.

But we seel E at 3.

""POWER"" has R out.

""POVEL"" not common.

""JOKED"" has D out.

""JOKE"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""TOKED"" has D out.

This is challenging.

E at position 4: _ _ _ E _

With O somewhere.

For example, O at 1: O _ _ E _

Or O at 2: _ O _ E _

Or O at 3: _ _ O E _

Or O at 5: _ _ _ E O

And avoid eliminated letters.

Available letters include B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y

For instance, ""USED"" has S, D out.

""PAGED"" has A, G, E, D? D out.

""A"" is out.

""OLE  "" not.

""OPEN  "" not.

"" OKE E"" not.

""BUOYE"" not.

""OWLET"" has O, W, L, E, T -> positions:1:O,2:W,3:L,4:E,5:T -> E at position 4, which is possible (E can be at 4). O at position 1.

Similarly, ""BOW E"" not.

""OWLET"" is a word: a small owl. Yes, valid.

Letters: O, W, L, E, T. All available? O, W, L, E, T. Avoids R,A,I,S,D,M,N.

E is at position 4, which is allowed (position 4 possible for E).

O is at position 1, which is allowed (not position 4).

We are testing O at position 1 and E at position 4.

Additionally, we test new letters W, L, T.

This seems good.

Another candidate: ""O ft E n"" not.

"" OVULE"" but has U, L, E? O, V, U, L, E. E at position 5? Position 5 not allowed for E.

"" OTT E R"" too long.

""OWLET"" seems solid.

Other words with E at 4 and O at 1? ""OFTEN"" has F, T, E, N? N out.

""N"" is eliminated.

""OPERA"" has P, E, R, A? R and A out.

""OKAYE"" not.

So ""OWLET"" is a good choice.

What about E at position 3 and O at position 5? For example, some word like _ _ E _ O

With available letters.

But we don't have an obvious word.

Or E at position 1 and O at position 3, like ""EBOLA"" but A out.

""ECT O"" not a word.

""EPH O"" not.

So ""OWLET"" seems best.

We also cover many new letters: O (at position 1), W, L, E (at position 4), T.

Even if not all are in the word, we gain information.

Another possibility: ""CLOTE"" not a word.

""GLOVE"" has G, L, O, V, E. E at position 5? Not allowed, 5 not for E.

""GLOBE"" E at 5.

""BLORE"" not.

""COULE"" not.

""VOLTE"" has V, O, L, T, E. E at 5? Position: V1, O2, L3, T4, E5 -> E at 5, not allowed.

So ""OWLET"" is good.

Another word: ""POULE"" P, O, U, L, E. E at position 5? Not allowed.

""TOILE"" T, O, I, L, E -> but I is out.

So not.

Or ""HOTEL"" H, O, T, E, L. E at position 4? Positions:1:H,2:O,3:T,4:E,5:L -> E at 4.

But O at position 2, which is new.

Letters H, O, T, E, L.

Avoids all eliminated: R,A,I,S,D,M,N are out.

So ""HOTEL"" has E at position 4, O at position 2.

We haven't tested position 2 for O? In DEMON, O was at position 4 and marked ""-"", but position 2 is new.

Similarly, we tested E at position 5 and 2, not 4.

So ""HOTEL"" is also a possibility.

E at 4 and O at 2.

Another common word with E and O: ""WHOLE"" W,H,O,L,E -> positions:1:W,2:H,3:O,4:L,5:E -> E at 5, not allowed.

""TONEL"" N out.

""BUTlE"" not.

So between ""OWLET"" and ""HOTEL"", both are valid.

""OWLET"" has O at 1, E at 4.
""HOTEL"" has O at 2, E at 4.

We might prefer one that tests a position for E we haven't tried. We tried E at position 5 and 2, so position 4 is new for E.

In both, E is at 4.

For O, we tried O at position 4 (wrong), so position 1 or 2 are new.

""OWLET"" tests O at position 1.
""HOTEL"" tests O at position 2.

Both are good.

But let's see which one has more common letters.

""HOTEL"": H, O, T, E, L
""OWLET"": O, W, L, E, T

""HOTEL"" has H and T, ""OWLET"" has W and T? T in both.

Both have T and L.

But ""HOTEL"" is more common.

We can also consider the feedback possibility.

But since we have no , we can choose either.

I'll go with ""HOTEL"" because it is a very common word.

Or to avoid potential issues with H, but it's fine.

Another word: ""COUPE"" C,O,U,P,E -> E at 5, not allowed.

""TOKER"" R out.

So ""HOTEL"".

But in ""HOTEL"", O is at position 2, which for E we had position 2 marked as wrong in DEMON, but now we are putting O at 2.

That's fine.

So guess: ""HOTEL""

If we do this, feedback will tell us about O at position 2 and E at position 4, and also about H, T, L.

Letters: H, O, T, E, L.

So <guess>HOTEL</guess>

But let's confirm all.

Eliminated letters not used: R,A,I,S,D,M,N not in HOTEL.

E at position 4? HOTEL: 1:H, 2:O, 3:T, 4:E, 5:L -> yes E at 4.

O at position 2.

Both un tested positions for these letters.

Perfect.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From GUESS 1 (RAISE): Letters R, A, I, S are not in the secret word (all marked ""x""). E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").
- From GUESS 2 (DEMON): Letters D, M, N are not in the secret word (all marked ""x""). E is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-""). O is in the word but not in position 4 (marked ""-"").

Consolidated known information:
- **Eliminated letters (not in the word)**: R, A, I, S, D, M, N
- **Confirmed present letters**: E and O, with positional constraints:
  - E must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).
  - O must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4).
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new letters to gather more information while incorporating E and O in valid positions. Avoid using eliminated letters.

For this guess:
- Selected ""HOTEL"" (a valid 5-letter word) because:
  - Includes E (position 4) and O (position 2), respecting positional constraints.
  - Tests new common letters (H, T, L) not yet evaluated.
  - Avoids all eliminated letters (R, A, I, S, D, M, N are absent).
- Expected information gain:
  - Confirms if E is in position 4 and O is in position 2.
  - Reveals presence/absence of H, T, L and their positions if present.
- Alternative considered: ""OWLET"" (O in position 1, E in position 4), but ""HOTEL"" was chosen for higher letter frequency coverage.

Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters to maximize information.\nCommon letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).\n\nA good starting word is often one that has a mix of common vowels and consonants. For example, ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"". I recall that ""RAISE"" is a popular starter because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n\nAlternatively, ""CRANE"" is another good one. But let\'s choose ""RAISE"" because it includes the vowel \'I\' in addition to \'A\' and \'E\'. \n\nSo, first guess: RAISE.\n\nBut note: We must output in the specified format.\n\nLet me output: \n<guess>RAISE</guess>For the first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants. This helps identify which letters are present in the secret word and their positions. \n\nI selected ""RAISE"" because:\n- It includes 3 common vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).\n- Letters like R, S, and E are statistically frequent in English words.\n- This combination offers broad coverage to interpret feedback efficiently (e.g., reveals potential ✓, -, or x patterns).\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or S. But it does contain the letter E, but not in the last position.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the letter E in one of the first four positions (positions 1 to 4, since position 5 is where we had E and it was wrong).\n\nWe know the word has E, and we know it doesn\'t have R, A, I, S.\n\nWe need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Includes E (to try to find its correct position) and\n- Uses other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet (since R, A, I, S are out).\n\nWe also avoid using R, A, I, S because they are not in the word.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe know E is in the word, so we can try to put E in a different position. Since in ""RAISE"" it was at the end (position 5) and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test multiple new letters and also try to place E in a new position.\n\nA good strategy is to use a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters that we haven\'t eliminated.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have E and avoid R, A, I, S.\n\nPossible letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.\n\nVowels: We know A and I are out, but O and U are still possible.\n\nA good candidate might be a word like ""CLOUD"", but that doesn\'t have E. We need to include E.\n\nAnother idea: ""HOUSE"" but H, O, U, S, E -> but S is out, so not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid S.\n\nHow about ""THREE""? But that has 5 letters? No, ""THREE"" is 6 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\nLet\'s think of 5-letter words with E and without R, A, I, S.\n\nSome options:\n- ""EVENT"": E, V, E, N, T -> but we have two E\'s? The secret word might have two E\'s? We don\'t know. But we can try. However, we have to consider that the feedback for E was only one occurrence (since we had one E and it was marked as present but wrong position). But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us about multiple occurrences. So the word might have more than one E? But in our guess, if we use two E\'s, we might get confusing feedback? Actually, it\'s okay because the feedback will mark each occurrence.\n\nBut we know that at least one E is present. If we use two E\'s, we might find out if there are two.\n\nBut let\'s avoid complexity for now and try to use one E and four new letters.\n\nWe can try to put E at the beginning? For example, words starting with E.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid R, A, I, S.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W -> no R,A,I,S.\n- ""EJECT"": E, J, E, C, T -> has two E\'s and J is uncommon.\n- ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> no R,A,I,S.\n\nBut we also want to cover common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""OUNCE"" -> O, U, N, C, E -> E at the end? But in the first guess, E was at the end and was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put E at the end again, and if the secret word has E at the end, it would be marked as correct (✓). But if it\'s not at the end, then we get more information.\n\nBut we know that E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at the end again, it will still be wrong position? Unless the secret word has two E\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo maximize information, we should try E in a different position. Since it was at position 5 and wrong, we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nLet me list some words without R,A,I,S and with E in a different position.\n\nPosition 1: \n- ""ELITE"" -> but has I (which is out) and T, E -> I is not allowed because we know I is not in the word.\nWe must avoid I.\n\nSo no I.\n\nPosition 1: \n- ""EJECT"" -> has E, J, E, C, T -> but J is uncommon and we have two E\'s.\n- ""EVERY"" -> has R (out) and Y.\n- ""EXERT"" -> has R and X.\n\nAvoid R.\n\nBetter: ""EVENT"" -> E, V, E, N, T -> has two E\'s and V, N, T. But we can use it? We don\'t know if V, N, T are in the word.\n\nBut we are trying to test new letters.\n\nAnother: ""ENEMY"" -> E, N, E, M, Y -> two E\'s and N, M, Y.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\n""OUNCE"" has E at the end, which we know is wrong. So if we put E at the end again, we might not get new information about E\'s position. But we can test other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can put E at position 1: ""EDGED"" -> two E\'s and D, G -> but G and D are good, but two E\'s and repeated D? Not ideal.\n\n""ETHIC"" -> has H, C, but also I (which is out) -> invalid because I is not in the word and we can\'t use it.\n\nWe must use only letters that are not eliminated? No, we can use any letters, but we know that R, A, I, S are not in the word, so using them would be wasteful because they will be marked as x and we get no new information. So we should avoid using R, A, I, S.\n\nSo, back to ""ELBOW"": E (position1), L, B, O, W. This uses E in position 1 and new letters: L, B, O, W.\n\nAnother option: ""MEDLEY"" -> 6 letters, too long.\n\n""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. This is good because we are trying E in a new position (position 2). And letters B, L, O, W are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""GLOBE"": G, L, O, B, E -> E at the end, which we know is wrong.\n\nSo ""BELOW"" seems better because E is in position 2.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CELLO"" -> C, E, L, L, O -> but has two L\'s? And E at position 2. But we can use it? However, repeated letters might not be ideal for information.\n\n""BLOKE"": B, L, O, K, E -> E at the end, same as before.\n\n""DEMON"": D, E, M, O, N -> E at position 2, and letters D, M, O, N.\n\nThis seems good: common letters D, M, O, N.\n\nSimilarly, ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> E at position 2, but L is also common.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe also have to consider that we are trying to find the position of E.\n\nSince E was not at position 5, and we try it at position 2, if it is correct, we get a ✓. If not, we know it\'s not at 2, and we can try other positions.\n\nMoreover, we get information about D, M, O, N.\n\nSo ""DEMON"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother one: ""HONEY"" -> H, O, N, E, Y -> E at position 4. That\'s also a new position.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\n""POUND"" -> no E, so not useful.\n\n""FLOUT"" -> no E.\n\nSo between ""BELOW"", ""DEMON"", ""HONEY"", I think ""DEMON"" is better because it has more common consonants.\n\nWe can also consider ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D -> E at position 4. This is also good.\n\nBut let\'s choose one that has E in a position we haven\'t tried. We tried position 5, so positions 1,2,3,4 are open.\n\nI think ""DEMON"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has any of these letters, but we are trying to cover ground.\n\nAnother word: ""MOUNT"" -> no E.\n\n""COULD"" -> no E.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""DEMON"".\n\nBut let me confirm: D, E, M, O, N. No R, A, I, S. E is at position 2.\n\nWe can also consider ""BONEY"" -> B, O, N, E, Y -> but Y is less common.\n\n""CONED"" -> C, O, N, E, D -> E at position 4.\n\nBut ""DEMON"" is a common word.\n\nAlternatively, ""EVENT"" has two E\'s, which might be useful? But we don\'t know if there are two E\'s.\n\nBut let\'s stick with one E for now.\n\nI think ""DEMON"" is a good second guess.\n\nSo, second guess: DEMON\n\nBut note: we have to output in the format.\n\n<guess>DEMON</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- We must avoid using R, A, I, S since they are eliminated.\n- We need to include E (as it is confirmed in the word) but in a new position (not position 5) to test its location.\n- We should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D, M) to maximize information gain.\n\nThe word ""DEMON"" fits well:\n- Includes E in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: D, M, O, N (all untested and frequent in English).\n- Avoids eliminated letters (R, A, I, S).\n\nThis guess will help identify:\n- If E is in position 2 (✓) or elsewhere (-).\n- Which of D, M, O, N are present and their positions.\n\n<guess>DEMON</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: DEMON -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given two pieces of feedback:\n\nFirst guess: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nThis means:\n- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word at all.\n- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed at position 5).\n\nSecond guess: DEMON -> D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x)\nSo:\n- D is not in the word (x)\n- E is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2)\n- M is not in the word (x)\n- O is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4)\n- N is not in the word (x)\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\nEliminated letters (not in secret word): R, A, I, S, D, M, N\n(From Guess 1: R, A, I, S; from Guess 2: D, M, N)\n\nConfirmed letters in the word: E and O\n- E is in the word but not in position 2 or 5 (from Guess 1 E was guessed at position 5, not correct; Guess 2 at position 2, not correct). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n- O is in the word but not in position 4 (from Guess 2, where it was at position 4). So O is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nWe need to guess a word that:\n- Contains E and O (since both are confirmed)\n- Avoids eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, D, M, N\n- We must consider possible positions for E and O.\n\nAlso, we should try to deduce the positions.\n\nFor E: Must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).\nFor O: Must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4).\n\nNow, let\'s think of common 5-letter words with E and O, avoiding eliminated letters.\n\nEliminated: R, A, I, S, D, M, N\n\nAvailable letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and E (but E and O are already included).\n\nWe need to use E and O, and three other letters from the available set.\n\nBut note: We also want to test new letters to gain more information.\n\nPossible words:\n\nFirst, considering E position and O position.\n\nLet\'s list words that have E and O.\n\nFor example, ""PROBE"" but has R (out) and P, B, E? R is eliminated.\n\n""CLOSE"" but has S (out).\n\n""NOTE"" but N is out, and it\'s only 4 letters? 5-letter words.\n\n""STORE"" has S (out) and R (out).\n\n""HOUSE"" has S (out).\n\n""LOUSE"" has S (out) and L? L is available.\n\nL is available, so perhaps we can use words with L.\n\n""LOTUS"" but has S (out).\n\n""POWER"" has R (out).\n\n""BOXER"" has R and X? But R is out.\n\nLet\'s avoid R.\n\n""OUNCE"" has N (out) and C, E? N is eliminated.\n\n""OZONE"" has two O\'s and Z? Z is rare.\n\n""EBONY"" has B, O, N (N is out), Y? N is eliminated.\n\n""FORGE"" has F, O, R (R out), G, E.\n\nR is out.\n\n""BOULE"" has B, O, U, L, E. No eliminated letters? Letters: B, O, U, L, E. Avoids R,A,I,S,D,M,N. So this is possible. And E at position 5? But wait, from first guess, E cannot be at position 5? We have E in ""RAISE"" at position 5 marked as (-) meaning present but wrong position, so position 5 is wrong for E. Then in ""DEMON"" E was at position 2 marked (-), so also wrong.\n\nSo E cannot be at position 5 or 2.\n\nWhat about ""BOULE""? B-O-U-L-E. So E at position 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5 because it was tried and wrong. So if we guess ""BOULE"" and put E at position 5, it will be wrong again.\n\nSo we should avoid putting E at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, we must put E at 1, 3, or 4.\n\nIn ""BOULE"" E is at 5, so not good.\n\nAnother word: ""BELOW"" but has E at position 2? In guess 2 we had DEMON with E at position 2 marked as wrong position. So if E is at 2, it would be wrong again? Unless the position is correct, but we know from DEMON that position 2 is wrong for E.\n\nSo E can\'t be at 2 or 5.\n\nSo E must be at 1, 3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, for O, we know it can\'t be at 4 (from DEMON).\n\nNow, let\'s think of words that have E and O, with O not at 4, and E at 1,3, or 4.\n\nPosition possibilities:\n\n- If E at position 1: then the word starts with E.\n- If E at position 3: E in the middle.\n- If E at position 4: fourth letter is E.\n\nAnd O can be at 1,2,3,5.\n\nBut note we have to avoid contradictions.\n\nFor example, if E is at position 1, then O cannot be at position 1? Because only one letter per position. So O must be at 2,3, or 5.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nNow, let\'s list possible words:\n\nFirst, E at position 1:\n\nWords like: E _ _ _ _, with O somewhere and avoiding eliminated letters.\n\nFor example: ""ELECT"" but has L,E,C,T? But ""ELECT"" has two E\'s? E, L, E, C, T? But position 1 and 3 are E? But we don\'t know if double E is allowed. But also, C and T are available.\n\nBut O is missing? We need O in the word.\n\nSo must include O.\n\n""EBOOK"" but B,O,O,K? Two O\'s? And K. But O must be present? We have O, but let\'s see if it fits. Also, ""EBOOK"" is a valid word? Yes. E at position1, B at 2, O at 3, O at 4, K at 5? But O at position4? We know from DEMON that O is not at position4? Because in DEMON, O was at position4 and marked ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not at position4. So it can be at other positions.\n\nBut ""EBOOK"" has O at position3 and position4. Position4 O is the same as what we guessed? We guessed O at position4 in DEMON and it was wrong position. But if the secret word has two O\'s, then O could be at position4? The feedback system: for each letter, it considers if that position is correct or if the letter exists elsewhere.\n\nIn DEMON, position4 had O and it was marked ""-"", meaning that O is in the word but not at position4. This does not preclude the word having multiple O\'s, but at position4 it is not O. So if the secret word has two O\'s, and one is at position4, it might have been marked correctly? But according to the rules, it would be marked ✓ only if exactly in the position. Since it was marked ""-"", it means that position4 is not O, and there is at least one O elsewhere.\n\nSo in ""EBOOK"", O is at position3 and position4. If we use it as a guess, and if the secret word has O at position4, it would be marked ✓ for that position? But we don\'t know if O is at position4 or not.\n\nFrom DEMON feedback, O is not at position4 because it was marked as ""-"", meaning it is present but not at that position. So secretly, O cannot be at position4; it must be in a different position.\n\nTherefore, in any guess, we should not put O at position4.\n\nSimilarly, for E, we should not put it at position2 or 5.\n\nSo back to E at position1: ""EBOOK""? E at1, O at3 and4. But position4 O is not allowed because we know O is not at position4. So putting O at position4 would be wasteful and will be marked as wrong position if the secret word has only one O? But we don\'t know if it has multiple O\'s.\n\nBut since we know that position4 is not O (from feedback), we should avoid putting O at position4 to save a slot.\n\nSo in ""EBOOK"", position4 has O, which we know cannot be correct, so that would likely be ""-"" or even ""x"" if there\'s only one O?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
  Meaning: R, A, I, S are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: DEMON -> D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x)
  Meaning: D, M, N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 2. O is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 3: HOTEL -> H(x) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) L(✓)
  Meaning: H and T are not in the word. O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2). E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

From Guess 3:
- O is at position 2 (✓)
- E is at position 4 (✓)
- L is at position 5 (✓)

So the secret word has the form: _ O _ E L

We also know from previous feedback:
- E is not at position 5 (from Guess 1) and not at position 2 (from Guess 2), which is consistent because now we know it's at position 4.
- O is not at position 4 (from Guess 2), which is consistent because it's at position 2.

Eliminated letters (not in the word): R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T
From all feedback:
- Guess 1: R, A, I, S
- Guess 2: D, M, N
- Guess 3: H, T

So eliminated: R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T

Confirmed in the word: O (pos2), E (pos4), L (pos5)

We need to find the first and third letters.

The word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E L

Available letters: We must avoid the eliminated ones. So available: B, C, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are the main ones).

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We have two positions to guess: position 1 and position 3.

We should choose a word that fits the pattern and uses common letters to maximize the chance of getting information.

But note: we have only two unknowns, so we might be able to guess the word.

We can try to think of words that match _ O _ E L

Common words:
- MODEL -> but M is eliminated (from Guess 2)
- HOTEL -> we already tried, and H and T are out
- NOVEL -> N is out, and V? But N eliminated
- JEWEL -> J, E, W, E, L? But pattern: J O ? E L? No, it's J E W E L -> positions don't match: position2 is E, but we need O at position2? No, in our pattern, position2 is O, but in JEWEL, position2 is E.

We need the second letter to be O and fourth to be E, fifth to be L.

So: 
Position1: ?
Position2: O
Position3: ?
Position4: E
Position5: L

So words like:
- BOXEL? Not a word.
- COWEL? COWEL is a word (a type of cowl or hood), but let's check: C O W E L -> positions: C at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, L at5. Yes, that fits.
- FOWEL? Not common, but F O W E L? Not a standard word.
- JOWEL? J O W E L -> JEWEL is J E W E L, not J O W E L.
- VOWEL: V O W E L -> V at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, L at5. Yes, ""vowel"" is a word.

Other possibilities:
- DOWEL: D O W E L -> but D is eliminated (from Guess 2).
- TOWEL: T O W E L -> but T is eliminated (from Guess 3).
- BOWEL: B O W E L -> B at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, L at5. Valid word.

So possible words: VOWEL, BOWEL, COWEL (if accepted).

But COWEL might be variant spelling, but typically it's COWL (4 letters) or COWLED. COWEL is not standard. Let's stick to common words.

Also, GOLEM? G O L E M -> but then position3 is L, but position5 is M? And pattern is _ O _ E L, so position5 must be L, but in GOLEM it's M. So no.

JOULE: J O U L E -> positions: J at1, O at2, U at3, L at4, E at5. But we need E at4 and L at5, but here L is at4 and E at5. So not matching.

So the pattern must have E at4 and L at5.

Other words: HOWEL? H is out, and not common.

POWEL? Not common.

So the common ones are: VOWEL and BOWEL.

Also, FOWEL? Not standard.

We can consider ""rowel"" but R is out.

So between VOWEL and BOWEL.

We have to choose one as our guess.

But note: we have two unknowns, so we can guess one and if wrong, the next.

But we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more letters? But we only have two positions.

We could guess a word that has both possibilities? But we have to use the known positions.

Since we know O, E, L are fixed, we can only vary position1 and position3.

In VOWEL: position1 is V, position3 is W.
In BOWEL: position1 is B, position3 is W.

Both have W at position3? 
- VOWEL: V O W E L -> position3 is W
- BOWEL: B O W E L -> position3 is W

So both have W at position3? Then what's the difference? Only position1: V vs B.

But we don't know if W is in the word? We haven't tested W.

In the pattern, position3 is unknown, so it could be W.

But we don't know if W is in the word.

We can guess a word that has W at position3 and then test position1.

But we have to choose a word.

We can guess ""VOWEL"" or ""BOWEL"".

But let's see if there are other words.

What about ""COWED""? But position5 is D, not L, and D is out.

""JOWLY""? J O W L Y -> position4 is L, but we need E at4? And position5 is Y. Not matching.

""LOWED""? L at position1? But then position5 is D, out.

So no.

Another word: ""POWEL"" is not standard. ""POWDER"" too long.

""TOWED"" has T out and D out.

So VOWEL and BOWEL are the main candidates.

But note: in both, position3 is W. So if we guess one of them, we can confirm if W is at position3.

But we don't know if W is in the word.

We could guess a word that doesn't assume W, but we have to fill position3 with something.

For example, could position3 be something else?

What other words fit _ O _ E L?

With available letters.

For instance:
- FOYER? F O Y E R -> but R is out, and position5 is R, not L? We need L at5.
- GOYER? Not a word.
- BOYER? B O Y E R -> R out.
- COYER? C O Y E R -> R out.
- HOPER? H out, R out.
- POPE L? Not.
- COPEL? Not common.
- GEMEL? G E M E L -> but position2 is E, not O.

So it seems that W is common in that position.

Another word: ""DOWLE"" but D out and not common.

""NOWEL"" N out.

So probably W is the most likely.

But we also have ""JOULE"" but doesn't fit pattern.

Or ""VOTEL"" not a word.

So let's consider VOWEL and BOWEL.

We can choose one.

But to be safe, we might guess a word that tests a different letter for position3, but we don't have many options.

We could guess a word that has a different letter at position3 to test.

For example, suppose we guess ""COGEL"" but not a word.

""FOGEL"" not.

""POKEL"" not.

So it's hard.

Another idea: ""BOXER"" but R out and X? And position4 E? Not.

So I think VOWEL or BOWEL are the choices.

We can look at letter frequency.

But let's see the feedback we have.

We know that in the word, we have O, E, L, and two more letters.

We don't have any information about position1 and position3 except that they are from the available set.

We can guess ""VOWEL"" to test V and W.

If it's not, then we can guess ""BOWEL"" next.

But we have two tries left? We have used 3, so 3 more? But we might solve it.

Since both have W at position3, if we guess one and W is not in the word, we know both are wrong.

But if W is in the word at position3, then we only need to find position1.

But we don't know.

We can guess a word that doesn't use W, but we don't have a common word.

For example, ""JOULE"" doesn't fit.

""BOULE"" B O U L E -> but position4 is L, not E, and position5 is E, not L? We need E at4 and L at5.

In ""BOULE"": B at1, O at2, U at3, L at4, E at5 -> but we need L at5 and E at4, so not.

""POULE"" same.

""COULE"" not.

So no.

Another word: ""GOFER"" G O F E R -> R out.

Not.

So I think we have to go with W at position3.

Now, between VOWEL and BOWEL, which one to choose?

We can consider which letters are more common.

But V and B are both possible.

We can look at the feedback from previous guesses to see if there's a hint, but I don't think so.

We can choose ""VOWEL"" because it's a common word.

Or ""BOWEL"" is also common.

But let's see the eliminated letters: we have many, so the secret word is likely to be one of these.

We can guess ""VOWEL"".

But note: we have to output the guess.

So I'll go with ""VOWEL"".

But let's confirm the pattern: V O W E L -> position2:O (correct), position4:E (correct), position5:L (correct). And position1:V, position3:W.

If it's not, then we try BOWEL next.

But we have only 3 guesses left? We have used 3, so 3 more, but we can solve.

Another word: ""HOWEL"" not common, H out.

""LOWER"" L at position1? But then position5 is R, out.

So I think VOWEL is a good guess.

So <guess>VOWEL</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: RAISE**  
  Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word.  
  - E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

- **Guess 2: DEMON**  
  Feedback: D(x), E(-), M(x), O(-), N(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - D, M, N are **not** in the secret word.  
  - E is in the word but **not in position 2**.  
  - O is in the word but **not in position 4**.

- **Guess 3: HOTEL**  
  Feedback: H(x), O(✓), T(x), E(✓), L(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - H and T are **not** in the secret word.  
  - O is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2**.  
  - E is in the word and **correctly placed in position 4**.  
  - L is in the word and **correctly placed in position 5**.

### Consolidated Information
- **Eliminated Letters (not in the word)**: R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T (from all feedback).  
- **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:  
  - Position 2: O (✓)  
  - Position 4: E (✓)  
  - Position 5: L (✓)  
- **Unknown Positions**:  
  - Position 1: Unknown letter (must be one of the remaining available letters).  
  - Position 3: Unknown letter (must be one of the remaining available letters).  
- **Available Letters**: B, C, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T are eliminated).  
- **Word Pattern**: The secret word must match the pattern `_ O _ E L` (e.g., position 1: unknown, position 2: O, position 3: unknown, position 4: E, position 5: L).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- The secret word is now narrowed to the pattern `_ O _ E L`, with only positions 1 and 3 unknown.  
- Common English words fitting this pattern include:  
  - **VOWEL** (V at position 1, W at position 3)  
  - **BOWEL** (B at position 1, W at position 3)  
  - Less common options like **COWEL** (C at position 1, W at position 3) are possible but less frequent.  
- **Why choose VOWEL?**  
  - It tests two new, relatively common letters: V (position 1) and W (position 3).  
  - If VOWEL is incorrect, feedback will confirm:  
    - Whether V is in the word (and if at position 1).  
    - Whether W is in the word (and if at position 3).  
  - This maximizes information gain, as W is a plausible letter for position 3 (based on common words), and V is a strong candidate for position 1.  
- **Why not BOWEL?**  
  - B is also a valid candidate for position 1, but VOWEL is prioritized here for its higher frequency in English and to test W explicitly. If VOWEL fails, BOWEL can be the next logical guess.  
- **Other letters?**  
  - No other common 5-letter words fit `_ O _ E L` with the available letters (e.g., J, U, or Y in position 1 or 3 are rare and form invalid words like JOWEL or FOYER, which don't match the pattern or use eliminated letters).  

### Expected Outcome
- If VOWEL is correct, the game ends.  
- If not, feedback on V and W will pinpoint the exact word (e.g., if V is absent, BOWEL becomes the top candidate; if W is absent, rarer options like COWEL or FOWEL may be considered, but BOWEL is more likely).  

<guess>VOWEL</guess>",VOWEL,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
  Meaning: R, A, I, S are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: DEMON -> D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x)
  Meaning: D, M, N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 2. O is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 3: HOTEL -> H(x) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) L(✓)
  Meaning: H and T are not in the word. O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2). E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

From Guess 3:
- O is at position 2 (✓)
- E is at position 4 (✓)
- L is at position 5 (✓)

So the secret word has the form: _ O _ E L

We also know from previous feedback:
- E is not at position 5 (from Guess 1) and not at position 2 (from Guess 2), which is consistent because now we know it's at position 4.
- O is not at position 4 (from Guess 2), which is consistent because it's at position 2.

Eliminated letters (not in the word): R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T
From all feedback:
- Guess 1: R, A, I, S
- Guess 2: D, M, N
- Guess 3: H, T

So eliminated: R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T

Confirmed in the word: O (pos2), E (pos4), L (pos5)

We need to find the first and third letters.

The word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E L

Available letters: We must avoid the eliminated ones. So available: B, C, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are the main ones).

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We have two positions to guess: position 1 and position 3.

We should choose a word that fits the pattern and uses common letters to maximize the chance of getting information.

But note: we have only two unknowns, so we might be able to guess the word.

We can try to think of words that match _ O _ E L

Common words:
- MODEL -> but M is eliminated (from Guess 2)
- HOTEL -> we already tried, and H and T are out
- NOVEL -> N is out, and V? But N eliminated
- JEWEL -> J, E, W, E, L? But pattern: J O ? E L? No, it's J E W E L -> positions don't match: position2 is E, but we need O at position2? No, in our pattern, position2 is O, but in JEWEL, position2 is E.

We need the second letter to be O and fourth to be E, fifth to be L.

So: 
Position1: ?
Position2: O
Position3: ?
Position4: E
Position5: L

So words like:
- BOXEL? Not a word.
- COWEL? COWEL is a word (a type of cowl or hood), but let's check: C O W E L -> positions: C at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, L at5. Yes, that fits.
- FOWEL? Not common, but F O W E L? Not a standard word.
- JOWEL? J O W E L -> JEWEL is J E W E L, not J O W E L.
- VOWEL: V O W E L -> V at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, L at5. Yes, ""vowel"" is a word.

Other possibilities:
- DOWEL: D O W E L -> but D is eliminated (from Guess 2).
- TOWEL: T O W E L -> but T is eliminated (from Guess 3).
- BOWEL: B O W E L -> B at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, L at5. Valid word.

So possible words: VOWEL, BOWEL, COWEL (if accepted).

But COWEL might be variant spelling, but typically it's COWL (4 letters) or COWLED. COWEL is not standard. Let's stick to common words.

Also, GOLEM? G O L E M -> but then position3 is L, but position5 is M? And pattern is _ O _ E L, so position5 must be L, but in GOLEM it's M. So no.

JOULE: J O U L E -> positions: J at1, O at2, U at3, L at4, E at5. But we need E at4 and L at5, but here L is at4 and E at5. So not matching.

So the pattern must have E at4 and L at5.

Other words: HOWEL? H is out, and not common.

POWEL? Not common.

So the common ones are: VOWEL and BOWEL.

Also, FOWEL? Not standard.

We can consider ""rowel"" but R is out.

So between VOWEL and BOWEL.

We have to choose one as our guess.

But note: we have two unknowns, so we can guess one and if wrong, the next.

But we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more letters? But we only have two positions.

We could guess a word that has both possibilities? But we have to use the known positions.

Since we know O, E, L are fixed, we can only vary position1 and position3.

In VOWEL: position1 is V, position3 is W.
In BOWEL: position1 is B, position3 is W.

Both have W at position3? 
- VOWEL: V O W E L -> position3 is W
- BOWEL: B O W E L -> position3 is W

So both have W at position3? Then what's the difference? Only position1: V vs B.

But we don't know if W is in the word? We haven't tested W.

In the pattern, position3 is unknown, so it could be W.

But we don't know if W is in the word.

We can guess a word that has W at position3 and then test position1.

But we have to choose a word.

We can guess ""VOWEL"" or ""BOWEL"".

But let's see if there are other words.

What about ""COWED""? But position5 is D, not L, and D is out.

""JOWLY""? J O W L Y -> position4 is L, but we need E at4? And position5 is Y. Not matching.

""LOWED""? L at position1? But then position5 is D, out.

So no.

Another word: ""POWEL"" is not standard. ""POWDER"" too long.

""TOWED"" has T out and D out.

So VOWEL and BOWEL are the main candidates.

But note: in both, position3 is W. So if we guess one of them, we can confirm if W is at position3.

But we don't know if W is in the word.

We could guess a word that doesn't assume W, but we have to fill position3 with something.

For example, could position3 be something else?

What other words fit _ O _ E L?

With available letters.

For instance:
- FOYER? F O Y E R -> but R is out, and position5 is R, not L? We need L at5.
- GOYER? Not a word.
- BOYER? B O Y E R -> R out.
- COYER? C O Y E R -> R out.
- HOPER? H out, R out.
- POPE L? Not.
- COPEL? Not common.
- GEMEL? G E M E L -> but position2 is E, not O.

So it seems that W is common in that position.

Another word: ""DOWLE"" but D out and not common.

""NOWEL"" N out.

So probably W is the most likely.

But we also have ""JOULE"" but doesn't fit pattern.

Or ""VOTEL"" not a word.

So let's consider VOWEL and BOWEL.

We can choose one.

But to be safe, we might guess a word that tests a different letter for position3, but we don't have many options.

We could guess a word that has a different letter at position3 to test.

For example, suppose we guess ""COGEL"" but not a word.

""FOGEL"" not.

""POKEL"" not.

So it's hard.

Another idea: ""BOXER"" but R out and X? And position4 E? Not.

So I think VOWEL or BOWEL are the choices.

We can look at letter frequency.

But let's see the feedback we have.

We know that in the word, we have O, E, L, and two more letters.

We don't have any information about position1 and position3 except that they are from the available set.

We can guess ""VOWEL"" to test V and W.

If it's not, then we can guess ""BOWEL"" next.

But we have two tries left? We have used 3, so 3 more? But we might solve it.

Since both have W at position3, if we guess one and W is not in the word, we know both are wrong.

But if W is in the word at position3, then we only need to find position1.

But we don't know.

We can guess a word that doesn't use W, but we don't have a common word.

For example, ""JOULE"" doesn't fit.

""BOULE"" B O U L E -> but position4 is L, not E, and position5 is E, not L? We need E at4 and L at5.

In ""BOULE"": B at1, O at2, U at3, L at4, E at5 -> but we need L at5 and E at4, so not.

""POULE"" same.

""COULE"" not.

So no.

Another word: ""GOFER"" G O F E R -> R out.

Not.

So I think we have to go with W at position3.

Now, between VOWEL and BOWEL, which one to choose?

We can consider which letters are more common.

But V and B are both possible.

We can look at the feedback from previous guesses to see if there's a hint, but I don't think so.

We can choose ""VOWEL"" because it's a common word.

Or ""BOWEL"" is also common.

But let's see the eliminated letters: we have many, so the secret word is likely to be one of these.

We can guess ""VOWEL"".

But note: we have to output the guess.

So I'll go with ""VOWEL"".

But let's confirm the pattern: V O W E L -> position2:O (correct), position4:E (correct), position5:L (correct). And position1:V, position3:W.

If it's not, then we try BOWEL next.

But we have only 3 guesses left? We have used 3, so 3 more, but we can solve.

Another word: ""HOWEL"" not common, H out.

""LOWER"" L at position1? But then position5 is R, out.

So I think VOWEL is a good guess.

So <guess>VOWEL</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: RAISE**  
  Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word.  
  - E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

- **Guess 2: DEMON**  
  Feedback: D(x), E(-), M(x), O(-), N(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - D, M, N are **not** in the secret word.  
  - E is in the word but **not in position 2**.  
  - O is in the word but **not in position 4**.

- **Guess 3: HOTEL**  
  Feedback: H(x), O(✓), T(x), E(✓), L(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - H and T are **not** in the secret word.  
  - O is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2**.  
  - E is in the word and **correctly placed in position 4**.  
  - L is in the word and **correctly placed in position 5**.

### Consolidated Information
- **Eliminated Letters (not in the word)**: R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T (from all feedback).  
- **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:  
  - Position 2: O (✓)  
  - Position 4: E (✓)  
  - Position 5: L (✓)  
- **Unknown Positions**:  
  - Position 1: Unknown letter (must be one of the remaining available letters).  
  - Position 3: Unknown letter (must be one of the remaining available letters).  
- **Available Letters**: B, C, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T are eliminated).  
- **Word Pattern**: The secret word must match the pattern `_ O _ E L` (e.g., position 1: unknown, position 2: O, position 3: unknown, position 4: E, position 5: L).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- The secret word is now narrowed to the pattern `_ O _ E L`, with only positions 1 and 3 unknown.  
- Common English words fitting this pattern include:  
  - **VOWEL** (V at position 1, W at position 3)  
  - **BOWEL** (B at position 1, W at position 3)  
  - Less common options like **COWEL** (C at position 1, W at position 3) are possible but less frequent.  
- **Why choose VOWEL?**  
  - It tests two new, relatively common letters: V (position 1) and W (position 3).  
  - If VOWEL is incorrect, feedback will confirm:  
    - Whether V is in the word (and if at position 1).  
    - Whether W is in the word (and if at position 3).  
  - This maximizes information gain, as W is a plausible letter for position 3 (based on common words), and V is a strong candidate for position 1.  
- **Why not BOWEL?**  
  - B is also a valid candidate for position 1, but VOWEL is prioritized here for its higher frequency in English and to test W explicitly. If VOWEL fails, BOWEL can be the next logical guess.  
- **Other letters?**  
  - No other common 5-letter words fit `_ O _ E L` with the available letters (e.g., J, U, or Y in position 1 or 3 are rare and form invalid words like JOWEL or FOYER, which don't match the pattern or use eliminated letters).  

### Expected Outcome
- If VOWEL is correct, the game ends.  
- If not, feedback on V and W will pinpoint the exact word (e.g., if V is absent, BOWEL becomes the top candidate; if W is absent, rarer options like COWEL or FOWEL may be considered, but BOWEL is more likely).",Guess 4: VOWEL -> FEEDBACK: V(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) L(✓),FAIL

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters to maximize information.
Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

A good starting word is often one that has a mix of common vowels and consonants. For example, ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"". I recall that ""RAISE"" is a popular starter because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is another good one. But let's choose ""RAISE"" because it includes the vowel 'I' in addition to 'A' and 'E'. 

So, first guess: RAISE.

But note: We must output in the specified format.

Let me output: 
<guess>RAISE</guess>For the first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants. This helps identify which letters are present in the secret word and their positions. 

I selected ""RAISE"" because:
- It includes 3 common vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).
- Letters like R, S, and E are statistically frequent in English words.
- This combination offers broad coverage to interpret feedback efficiently (e.g., reveals potential ✓, -, or x patterns).

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or S. But it does contain the letter E, but not in the last position.

Therefore, the secret word has the letter E in one of the first four positions (positions 1 to 4, since position 5 is where we had E and it was wrong).

We know the word has E, and we know it doesn't have R, A, I, S.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes E (to try to find its correct position) and
- Uses other common letters that we haven't tried yet (since R, A, I, S are out).

We also avoid using R, A, I, S because they are not in the word.

Common letters we haven't tried: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

We know E is in the word, so we can try to put E in a different position. Since in ""RAISE"" it was at the end (position 5) and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test multiple new letters and also try to place E in a new position.

A good strategy is to use a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters that we haven't eliminated.

Let's think of words that have E and avoid R, A, I, S.

Possible letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Vowels: We know A and I are out, but O and U are still possible.

A good candidate might be a word like ""CLOUD"", but that doesn't have E. We need to include E.

Another idea: ""HOUSE"" but H, O, U, S, E -> but S is out, so not allowed.

We must avoid S.

How about ""THREE""? But that has 5 letters? No, ""THREE"" is 6 letters. We need 5 letters.

Let's think of 5-letter words with E and without R, A, I, S.

Some options:
- ""EVENT"": E, V, E, N, T -> but we have two E's? The secret word might have two E's? We don't know. But we can try. However, we have to consider that the feedback for E was only one occurrence (since we had one E and it was marked as present but wrong position). But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple occurrences. So the word might have more than one E? But in our guess, if we use two E's, we might get confusing feedback? Actually, it's okay because the feedback will mark each occurrence.

But we know that at least one E is present. If we use two E's, we might find out if there are two.

But let's avoid complexity for now and try to use one E and four new letters.

We can try to put E at the beginning? For example, words starting with E.

But note: we have to avoid R, A, I, S.

Common words: 
- ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W -> no R,A,I,S.
- ""EJECT"": E, J, E, C, T -> has two E's and J is uncommon.
- ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> no R,A,I,S.

But we also want to cover common letters.

Another idea: ""OUNCE"" -> O, U, N, C, E -> E at the end? But in the first guess, E was at the end and was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put E at the end again, and if the secret word has E at the end, it would be marked as correct (✓). But if it's not at the end, then we get more information.

But we know that E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at the end again, it will still be wrong position? Unless the secret word has two E's? But we don't know.

To maximize information, we should try E in a different position. Since it was at position 5 and wrong, we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let me list some words without R,A,I,S and with E in a different position.

Position 1: 
- ""ELITE"" -> but has I (which is out) and T, E -> I is not allowed because we know I is not in the word.
We must avoid I.

So no I.

Position 1: 
- ""EJECT"" -> has E, J, E, C, T -> but J is uncommon and we have two E's.
- ""EVERY"" -> has R (out) and Y.
- ""EXERT"" -> has R and X.

Avoid R.

Better: ""EVENT"" -> E, V, E, N, T -> has two E's and V, N, T. But we can use it? We don't know if V, N, T are in the word.

But we are trying to test new letters.

Another: ""ENEMY"" -> E, N, E, M, Y -> two E's and N, M, Y.

But Y is less common.

""OUNCE"" has E at the end, which we know is wrong. So if we put E at the end again, we might not get new information about E's position. But we can test other letters.

Alternatively, we can put E at position 1: ""EDGED"" -> two E's and D, G -> but G and D are good, but two E's and repeated D? Not ideal.

""ETHIC"" -> has H, C, but also I (which is out) -> invalid because I is not in the word and we can't use it.

We must use only letters that are not eliminated? No, we can use any letters, but we know that R, A, I, S are not in the word, so using them would be wasteful because they will be marked as x and we get no new information. So we should avoid using R, A, I, S.

So, back to ""ELBOW"": E (position1), L, B, O, W. This uses E in position 1 and new letters: L, B, O, W.

Another option: ""MEDLEY"" -> 6 letters, too long.

""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. This is good because we are trying E in a new position (position 2). And letters B, L, O, W are new.

Similarly, ""GLOBE"": G, L, O, B, E -> E at the end, which we know is wrong.

So ""BELOW"" seems better because E is in position 2.

Another candidate: ""CELLO"" -> C, E, L, L, O -> but has two L's? And E at position 2. But we can use it? However, repeated letters might not be ideal for information.

""BLOKE"": B, L, O, K, E -> E at the end, same as before.

""DEMON"": D, E, M, O, N -> E at position 2, and letters D, M, O, N.

This seems good: common letters D, M, O, N.

Similarly, ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> E at position 2, but L is also common.

But we have to choose one.

We also have to consider that we are trying to find the position of E.

Since E was not at position 5, and we try it at position 2, if it is correct, we get a ✓. If not, we know it's not at 2, and we can try other positions.

Moreover, we get information about D, M, O, N.

So ""DEMON"" is a good candidate.

Another one: ""HONEY"" -> H, O, N, E, Y -> E at position 4. That's also a new position.

But Y is less common.

""POUND"" -> no E, so not useful.

""FLOUT"" -> no E.

So between ""BELOW"", ""DEMON"", ""HONEY"", I think ""DEMON"" is better because it has more common consonants.

We can also consider ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D -> E at position 4. This is also good.

But let's choose one that has E in a position we haven't tried. We tried position 5, so positions 1,2,3,4 are open.

I think ""DEMON"" is a solid choice.

But note: we are not sure if the word has any of these letters, but we are trying to cover ground.

Another word: ""MOUNT"" -> no E.

""COULD"" -> no E.

So I'll go with ""DEMON"".

But let me confirm: D, E, M, O, N. No R, A, I, S. E is at position 2.

We can also consider ""BONEY"" -> B, O, N, E, Y -> but Y is less common.

""CONED"" -> C, O, N, E, D -> E at position 4.

But ""DEMON"" is a common word.

Alternatively, ""EVENT"" has two E's, which might be useful? But we don't know if there are two E's.

But let's stick with one E for now.

I think ""DEMON"" is a good second guess.

So, second guess: DEMON

But note: we have to output in the format.

<guess>DEMON</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- We must avoid using R, A, I, S since they are eliminated.
- We need to include E (as it is confirmed in the word) but in a new position (not position 5) to test its location.
- We should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D, M) to maximize information gain.

The word ""DEMON"" fits well:
- Includes E in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: D, M, O, N (all untested and frequent in English).
- Avoids eliminated letters (R, A, I, S).

This guess will help identify:
- If E is in position 2 (✓) or elsewhere (-).
- Which of D, M, O, N are present and their positions.

<guess>DEMON</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: DEMON -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given two pieces of feedback:

First guess: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
This means:
- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word at all.
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed at position 5).

Second guess: DEMON -> D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x)
So:
- D is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2)
- M is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4)
- N is not in the word (x)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

Eliminated letters (not in secret word): R, A, I, S, D, M, N
(From Guess 1: R, A, I, S; from Guess 2: D, M, N)

Confirmed letters in the word: E and O
- E is in the word but not in position 2 or 5 (from Guess 1 E was guessed at position 5, not correct; Guess 2 at position 2, not correct). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (from Guess 2, where it was at position 4). So O is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need to guess a word that:
- Contains E and O (since both are confirmed)
- Avoids eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, D, M, N
- We must consider possible positions for E and O.

Also, we should try to deduce the positions.

For E: Must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).
For O: Must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4).

Now, let's think of common 5-letter words with E and O, avoiding eliminated letters.

Eliminated: R, A, I, S, D, M, N

Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and E (but E and O are already included).

We need to use E and O, and three other letters from the available set.

But note: We also want to test new letters to gain more information.

Possible words:

First, considering E position and O position.

Let's list words that have E and O.

For example, ""PROBE"" but has R (out) and P, B, E? R is eliminated.

""CLOSE"" but has S (out).

""NOTE"" but N is out, and it's only 4 letters? 5-letter words.

""STORE"" has S (out) and R (out).

""HOUSE"" has S (out).

""LOUSE"" has S (out) and L? L is available.

L is available, so perhaps we can use words with L.

""LOTUS"" but has S (out).

""POWER"" has R (out).

""BOXER"" has R and X? But R is out.

Let's avoid R.

""OUNCE"" has N (out) and C, E? N is eliminated.

""OZONE"" has two O's and Z? Z is rare.

""EBONY"" has B, O, N (N is out), Y? N is eliminated.

""FORGE"" has F, O, R (R out), G, E.

R is out.

""BOULE"" has B, O, U, L, E. No eliminated letters? Letters: B, O, U, L, E. Avoids R,A,I,S,D,M,N. So this is possible. And E at position 5? But wait, from first guess, E cannot be at position 5? We have E in ""RAISE"" at position 5 marked as (-) meaning present but wrong position, so position 5 is wrong for E. Then in ""DEMON"" E was at position 2 marked (-), so also wrong.

So E cannot be at position 5 or 2.

What about ""BOULE""? B-O-U-L-E. So E at position 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5 because it was tried and wrong. So if we guess ""BOULE"" and put E at position 5, it will be wrong again.

So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

Similarly, we must put E at 1, 3, or 4.

In ""BOULE"" E is at 5, so not good.

Another word: ""BELOW"" but has E at position 2? In guess 2 we had DEMON with E at position 2 marked as wrong position. So if E is at 2, it would be wrong again? Unless the position is correct, but we know from DEMON that position 2 is wrong for E.

So E can't be at 2 or 5.

So E must be at 1, 3, or 4.

Similarly, for O, we know it can't be at 4 (from DEMON).

Now, let's think of words that have E and O, with O not at 4, and E at 1,3, or 4.

Position possibilities:

- If E at position 1: then the word starts with E.
- If E at position 3: E in the middle.
- If E at position 4: fourth letter is E.

And O can be at 1,2,3,5.

But note we have to avoid contradictions.

For example, if E is at position 1, then O cannot be at position 1? Because only one letter per position. So O must be at 2,3, or 5.

Similarly for other positions.

Now, let's list possible words:

First, E at position 1:

Words like: E _ _ _ _, with O somewhere and avoiding eliminated letters.

For example: ""ELECT"" but has L,E,C,T? But ""ELECT"" has two E's? E, L, E, C, T? But position 1 and 3 are E? But we don't know if double E is allowed. But also, C and T are available.

But O is missing? We need O in the word.

So must include O.

""EBOOK"" but B,O,O,K? Two O's? And K. But O must be present? We have O, but let's see if it fits. Also, ""EBOOK"" is a valid word? Yes. E at position1, B at 2, O at 3, O at 4, K at 5? But O at position4? We know from DEMON that O is not at position4? Because in DEMON, O was at position4 and marked ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not at position4. So it can be at other positions.

But ""EBOOK"" has O at position3 and position4. Position4 O is the same as what we guessed? We guessed O at position4 in DEMON and it was wrong position. But if the secret word has two O's, then O could be at position4? The feedback system: for each letter, it considers if that position is correct or if the letter exists elsewhere.

In DEMON, position4 had O and it was marked ""-"", meaning that O is in the word but not at position4. This does not preclude the word having multiple O's, but at position4 it is not O. So if the secret word has two O's, and one is at position4, it might have been marked correctly? But according to the rules, it would be marked ✓ only if exactly in the position. Since it was marked ""-"", it means that position4 is not O, and there is at least one O elsewhere.

So in ""EBOOK"", O is at position3 and position4. If we use it as a guess, and if the secret word has O at position4, it would be marked ✓ for that position? But we don't know if O is at position4 or not.

From DEMON feedback, O is not at position4 because it was marked as ""-"", meaning it is present but not at that position. So secretly, O cannot be at position4; it must be in a different position.

Therefore, in any guess, we should not put O at position4.

Similarly, for E, we should not put it at position2 or 5.

So back to E at position1: ""EBOOK""? E at1, O at3 and4. But position4 O is not allowed because we know O is not at position4. So putting O at position4 would be wasteful and will be marked as wrong position if the secret word has only one O? But we don't know if it has multiple O's.

But since we know that position4 is not O (from feedback), we should avoid putting O at position4 to save a slot.

So in ""EBOOK"", position4 has O, which we know cannot be correct, so that would likely be ""-"" or even ""x"" if there's only one O? But it doesn't help us much.

Better to choose a word where O is in a position we haven't tested.

Similarly for E.

Available positions for E: 1,3,4
For O: 1,2,3,5 (not 4)

Possible positions:

Case: E at 1, O at 2: E O _ _ _
With letters avoiding eliminated ones.

Words: ""EOYEʉ"" not a word.

""EOLITE"" has I (out).

Not common.

E at 1, O at 3: E _ O _ _
Example: ""ETHOS"" but has H, S (S out).

""EXPOS"" has S and X? S out.

""ELOPS"" not common.

Perhaps E at 1 and O at 5: E _ _ _ O
Words: ""EMAIL"" has A (out) and I.

""EBOLA"" has A (out) and L.

""ECHO"" is 4 letters? ""ECLAT"" has A.

5-letter words: ""ERGOT"" has R out.

""EMBOW"" but M out.

Difficult.

E at 1, O at 5: E _ _ _ O
And avoid A, I, R, S, D, M, N.

Available: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y

So, for example, ""EBURO"" not a word.

""ECOLO"" not.

""EVER O"" 6 letters.

""ECHOO"" not standard.

""EER O"" not.

Perhaps ""EUROS"" but has S out.

Hard to find.

Now, E at 3: _ _ E _ _

With O somewhere.

E at 3, O at 1: O _ E _ _
Words: ""OWEre"" not.

""OP e a"" not.

""OAKED"" has A and K, D? D out, A out.

""OBELI"" has I out.

""OCEAN"" has A and C, E? A out.

""OCREA"" not common.

E at 3, O at 2: _ O E _ _
Words: ""BOWEL"" has B, O, W, E, L -> O at 2, E at 3? Positions:1:B,2:O,3:W,4:E,5:L? No, E is at 4, not 3.

""BOXEN"" has N out.

""COVET"" has C, O, V, E, T -> O at 2, E at 4? Not at 3.

If E at position 3, then _ _ E _ _

With O at 2: _ O E _ _

or O at 1: O _ E _ _

or O at 5: _ _ E _ O

 Etc.

Word like ""TOPIC"" has I and no E.

""LOVES"" has S out.

""ROLEX"" has R out.

""FOG EY"" not.

""BOGLE"" has B, O, G, L, E -> positions:1:B,2:O,3:G,4:L,5:E -> E at 5, which we cannot.

But we seel E at 3.

""POWER"" has R out.

""POVEL"" not common.

""JOKED"" has D out.

""JOKE"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""TOKED"" has D out.

This is challenging.

E at position 4: _ _ _ E _

With O somewhere.

For example, O at 1: O _ _ E _

Or O at 2: _ O _ E _

Or O at 3: _ _ O E _

Or O at 5: _ _ _ E O

And avoid eliminated letters.

Available letters include B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y

For instance, ""USED"" has S, D out.

""PAGED"" has A, G, E, D? D out.

""A"" is out.

""OLE  "" not.

""OPEN  "" not.

"" OKE E"" not.

""BUOYE"" not.

""OWLET"" has O, W, L, E, T -> positions:1:O,2:W,3:L,4:E,5:T -> E at position 4, which is possible (E can be at 4). O at position 1.

Similarly, ""BOW E"" not.

""OWLET"" is a word: a small owl. Yes, valid.

Letters: O, W, L, E, T. All available? O, W, L, E, T. Avoids R,A,I,S,D,M,N.

E is at position 4, which is allowed (position 4 possible for E).

O is at position 1, which is allowed (not position 4).

We are testing O at position 1 and E at position 4.

Additionally, we test new letters W, L, T.

This seems good.

Another candidate: ""O ft E n"" not.

"" OVULE"" but has U, L, E? O, V, U, L, E. E at position 5? Position 5 not allowed for E.

"" OTT E R"" too long.

""OWLET"" seems solid.

Other words with E at 4 and O at 1? ""OFTEN"" has F, T, E, N? N out.

""N"" is eliminated.

""OPERA"" has P, E, R, A? R and A out.

""OKAYE"" not.

So ""OWLET"" is a good choice.

What about E at position 3 and O at position 5? For example, some word like _ _ E _ O

With available letters.

But we don't have an obvious word.

Or E at position 1 and O at position 3, like ""EBOLA"" but A out.

""ECT O"" not a word.

""EPH O"" not.

So ""OWLET"" seems best.

We also cover many new letters: O (at position 1), W, L, E (at position 4), T.

Even if not all are in the word, we gain information.

Another possibility: ""CLOTE"" not a word.

""GLOVE"" has G, L, O, V, E. E at position 5? Not allowed, 5 not for E.

""GLOBE"" E at 5.

""BLORE"" not.

""COULE"" not.

""VOLTE"" has V, O, L, T, E. E at 5? Position: V1, O2, L3, T4, E5 -> E at 5, not allowed.

So ""OWLET"" is good.

Another word: ""POULE"" P, O, U, L, E. E at position 5? Not allowed.

""TOILE"" T, O, I, L, E -> but I is out.

So not.

Or ""HOTEL"" H, O, T, E, L. E at position 4? Positions:1:H,2:O,3:T,4:E,5:L -> E at 4.

But O at position 2, which is new.

Letters H, O, T, E, L.

Avoids all eliminated: R,A,I,S,D,M,N are out.

So ""HOTEL"" has E at position 4, O at position 2.

We haven't tested position 2 for O? In DEMON, O was at position 4 and marked ""-"", but position 2 is new.

Similarly, we tested E at position 5 and 2, not 4.

So ""HOTEL"" is also a possibility.

E at 4 and O at 2.

Another common word with E and O: ""WHOLE"" W,H,O,L,E -> positions:1:W,2:H,3:O,4:L,5:E -> E at 5, not allowed.

""TONEL"" N out.

""BUTlE"" not.

So between ""OWLET"" and ""HOTEL"", both are valid.

""OWLET"" has O at 1, E at 4.
""HOTEL"" has O at 2, E at 4.

We might prefer one that tests a position for E we haven't tried. We tried E at position 5 and 2, so position 4 is new for E.

In both, E is at 4.

For O, we tried O at position 4 (wrong), so position 1 or 2 are new.

""OWLET"" tests O at position 1.
""HOTEL"" tests O at position 2.

Both are good.

But let's see which one has more common letters.

""HOTEL"": H, O, T, E, L
""OWLET"": O, W, L, E, T

""HOTEL"" has H and T, ""OWLET"" has W and T? T in both.

Both have T and L.

But ""HOTEL"" is more common.

We can also consider the feedback possibility.

But since we have no , we can choose either.

I'll go with ""HOTEL"" because it is a very common word.

Or to avoid potential issues with H, but it's fine.

Another word: ""COUPE"" C,O,U,P,E -> E at 5, not allowed.

""TOKER"" R out.

So ""HOTEL"".

But in ""HOTEL"", O is at position 2, which for E we had position 2 marked as wrong in DEMON, but now we are putting O at 2.

That's fine.

So guess: ""HOTEL""

If we do this, feedback will tell us about O at position 2 and E at position 4, and also about H, T, L.

Letters: H, O, T, E, L.

So <guess>HOTEL</guess>

But let's confirm all.

Eliminated letters not used: R,A,I,S,D,M,N not in HOTEL.

E at position 4? HOTEL: 1:H, 2:O, 3:T, 4:E, 5:L -> yes E at 4.

O at position 2.

Both un tested positions for these letters.

Perfect.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- From GUESS 1 (RAISE): Letters R, A, I, S are not in the secret word (all marked ""x""). E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").
- From GUESS 2 (DEMON): Letters D, M, N are not in the secret word (all marked ""x""). E is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-""). O is in the word but not in position 4 (marked ""-"").

Consolidated known information:
- **Eliminated letters (not in the word)**: R, A, I, S, D, M, N
- **Confirmed present letters**: E and O, with positional constraints:
  - E must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).
  - O must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4).
- **Goal for next guess**: Test new letters to gather more information while incorporating E and O in valid positions. Avoid using eliminated letters.

For this guess:
- Selected ""HOTEL"" (a valid 5-letter word) because:
  - Includes E (position 4) and O (position 2), respecting positional constraints.
  - Tests new common letters (H, T, L) not yet evaluated.
  - Avoids all eliminated letters (R, A, I, S, D, M, N are absent).
- Expected information gain:
  - Confirms if E is in position 4 and O is in position 2.
  - Reveals presence/absence of H, T, L and their positions if present.
- Alternative considered: ""OWLET"" (O in position 1, E in position 4), but ""HOTEL"" was chosen for higher letter frequency coverage.

<guess>HOTEL</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: DEMON -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x)
Guess 3: HOTEL -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) L(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
  Meaning: R, A, I, S are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: DEMON -> D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x)
  Meaning: D, M, N are not in the word. E is in the word but not in position 2. O is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 3: HOTEL -> H(x) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) L(✓)
  Meaning: H and T are not in the word. O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2). E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4). L is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

From Guess 3:
- O is at position 2 (✓)
- E is at position 4 (✓)
- L is at position 5 (✓)

So the secret word has the form: _ O _ E L

We also know from previous feedback:
- E is not at position 5 (from Guess 1) and not at position 2 (from Guess 2), which is consistent because now we know it's at position 4.
- O is not at position 4 (from Guess 2), which is consistent because it's at position 2.

Eliminated letters (not in the word): R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T
From all feedback:
- Guess 1: R, A, I, S
- Guess 2: D, M, N
- Guess 3: H, T

So eliminated: R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T

Confirmed in the word: O (pos2), E (pos4), L (pos5)

We need to find the first and third letters.

The word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E L

Available letters: We must avoid the eliminated ones. So available: B, C, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are the main ones).

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We have two positions to guess: position 1 and position 3.

We should choose a word that fits the pattern and uses common letters to maximize the chance of getting information.

But note: we have only two unknowns, so we might be able to guess the word.

We can try to think of words that match _ O _ E L

Common words:
- MODEL -> but M is eliminated (from Guess 2)
- HOTEL -> we already tried, and H and T are out
- NOVEL -> N is out, and V? But N eliminated
- JEWEL -> J, E, W, E, L? But pattern: J O ? E L? No, it's J E W E L -> positions don't match: position2 is E, but we need O at position2? No, in our pattern, position2 is O, but in JEWEL, position2 is E.

We need the second letter to be O and fourth to be E, fifth to be L.

So: 
Position1: ?
Position2: O
Position3: ?
Position4: E
Position5: L

So words like:
- BOXEL? Not a word.
- COWEL? COWEL is a word (a type of cowl or hood), but let's check: C O W E L -> positions: C at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, L at5. Yes, that fits.
- FOWEL? Not common, but F O W E L? Not a standard word.
- JOWEL? J O W E L -> JEWEL is J E W E L, not J O W E L.
- VOWEL: V O W E L -> V at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, L at5. Yes, ""vowel"" is a word.

Other possibilities:
- DOWEL: D O W E L -> but D is eliminated (from Guess 2).
- TOWEL: T O W E L -> but T is eliminated (from Guess 3).
- BOWEL: B O W E L -> B at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, L at5. Valid word.

So possible words: VOWEL, BOWEL, COWEL (if accepted).

But COWEL might be variant spelling, but typically it's COWL (4 letters) or COWLED. COWEL is not standard. Let's stick to common words.

Also, GOLEM? G O L E M -> but then position3 is L, but position5 is M? And pattern is _ O _ E L, so position5 must be L, but in GOLEM it's M. So no.

JOULE: J O U L E -> positions: J at1, O at2, U at3, L at4, E at5. But we need E at4 and L at5, but here L is at4 and E at5. So not matching.

So the pattern must have E at4 and L at5.

Other words: HOWEL? H is out, and not common.

POWEL? Not common.

So the common ones are: VOWEL and BOWEL.

Also, FOWEL? Not standard.

We can consider ""rowel"" but R is out.

So between VOWEL and BOWEL.

We have to choose one as our guess.

But note: we have two unknowns, so we can guess one and if wrong, the next.

But we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more letters? But we only have two positions.

We could guess a word that has both possibilities? But we have to use the known positions.

Since we know O, E, L are fixed, we can only vary position1 and position3.

In VOWEL: position1 is V, position3 is W.
In BOWEL: position1 is B, position3 is W.

Both have W at position3? 
- VOWEL: V O W E L -> position3 is W
- BOWEL: B O W E L -> position3 is W

So both have W at position3? Then what's the difference? Only position1: V vs B.

But we don't know if W is in the word? We haven't tested W.

In the pattern, position3 is unknown, so it could be W.

But we don't know if W is in the word.

We can guess a word that has W at position3 and then test position1.

But we have to choose a word.

We can guess ""VOWEL"" or ""BOWEL"".

But let's see if there are other words.

What about ""COWED""? But position5 is D, not L, and D is out.

""JOWLY""? J O W L Y -> position4 is L, but we need E at4? And position5 is Y. Not matching.

""LOWED""? L at position1? But then position5 is D, out.

So no.

Another word: ""POWEL"" is not standard. ""POWDER"" too long.

""TOWED"" has T out and D out.

So VOWEL and BOWEL are the main candidates.

But note: in both, position3 is W. So if we guess one of them, we can confirm if W is at position3.

But we don't know if W is in the word.

We could guess a word that doesn't assume W, but we have to fill position3 with something.

For example, could position3 be something else?

What other words fit _ O _ E L?

With available letters.

For instance:
- FOYER? F O Y E R -> but R is out, and position5 is R, not L? We need L at5.
- GOYER? Not a word.
- BOYER? B O Y E R -> R out.
- COYER? C O Y E R -> R out.
- HOPER? H out, R out.
- POPE L? Not.
- COPEL? Not common.
- GEMEL? G E M E L -> but position2 is E, not O.

So it seems that W is common in that position.

Another word: ""DOWLE"" but D out and not common.

""NOWEL"" N out.

So probably W is the most likely.

But we also have ""JOULE"" but doesn't fit pattern.

Or ""VOTEL"" not a word.

So let's consider VOWEL and BOWEL.

We can choose one.

But to be safe, we might guess a word that tests a different letter for position3, but we don't have many options.

We could guess a word that has a different letter at position3 to test.

For example, suppose we guess ""COGEL"" but not a word.

""FOGEL"" not.

""POKEL"" not.

So it's hard.

Another idea: ""BOXER"" but R out and X? And position4 E? Not.

So I think VOWEL or BOWEL are the choices.

We can look at letter frequency.

But let's see the feedback we have.

We know that in the word, we have O, E, L, and two more letters.

We don't have any information about position1 and position3 except that they are from the available set.

We can guess ""VOWEL"" to test V and W.

If it's not, then we can guess ""BOWEL"" next.

But we have two tries left? We have used 3, so 3 more? But we might solve it.

Since both have W at position3, if we guess one and W is not in the word, we know both are wrong.

But if W is in the word at position3, then we only need to find position1.

But we don't know.

We can guess a word that doesn't use W, but we don't have a common word.

For example, ""JOULE"" doesn't fit.

""BOULE"" B O U L E -> but position4 is L, not E, and position5 is E, not L? We need E at4 and L at5.

In ""BOULE"": B at1, O at2, U at3, L at4, E at5 -> but we need L at5 and E at4, so not.

""POULE"" same.

""COULE"" not.

So no.

Another word: ""GOFER"" G O F E R -> R out.

Not.

So I think we have to go with W at position3.

Now, between VOWEL and BOWEL, which one to choose?

We can consider which letters are more common.

But V and B are both possible.

We can look at the feedback from previous guesses to see if there's a hint, but I don't think so.

We can choose ""VOWEL"" because it's a common word.

Or ""BOWEL"" is also common.

But let's see the eliminated letters: we have many, so the secret word is likely to be one of these.

We can guess ""VOWEL"".

But note: we have to output the guess.

So I'll go with ""VOWEL"".

But let's confirm the pattern: V O W E L -> position2:O (correct), position4:E (correct), position5:L (correct). And position1:V, position3:W.

If it's not, then we try BOWEL next.

But we have only 3 guesses left? We have used 3, so 3 more, but we can solve.

Another word: ""HOWEL"" not common, H out.

""LOWER"" L at position1? But then position5 is R, out.

So I think VOWEL is a good guess.

So <guess>VOWEL</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: RAISE**  
  Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word.  
  - E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

- **Guess 2: DEMON**  
  Feedback: D(x), E(-), M(x), O(-), N(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - D, M, N are **not** in the secret word.  
  - E is in the word but **not in position 2**.  
  - O is in the word but **not in position 4**.

- **Guess 3: HOTEL**  
  Feedback: H(x), O(✓), T(x), E(✓), L(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - H and T are **not** in the secret word.  
  - O is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2**.  
  - E is in the word and **correctly placed in position 4**.  
  - L is in the word and **correctly placed in position 5**.

### Consolidated Information
- **Eliminated Letters (not in the word)**: R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T (from all feedback).  
- **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:  
  - Position 2: O (✓)  
  - Position 4: E (✓)  
  - Position 5: L (✓)  
- **Unknown Positions**:  
  - Position 1: Unknown letter (must be one of the remaining available letters).  
  - Position 3: Unknown letter (must be one of the remaining available letters).  
- **Available Letters**: B, C, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T are eliminated).  
- **Word Pattern**: The secret word must match the pattern `_ O _ E L` (e.g., position 1: unknown, position 2: O, position 3: unknown, position 4: E, position 5: L).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- The secret word is now narrowed to the pattern `_ O _ E L`, with only positions 1 and 3 unknown.  
- Common English words fitting this pattern include:  
  - **VOWEL** (V at position 1, W at position 3)  
  - **BOWEL** (B at position 1, W at position 3)  
  - Less common options like **COWEL** (C at position 1, W at position 3) are possible but less frequent.  
- **Why choose VOWEL?**  
  - It tests two new, relatively common letters: V (position 1) and W (position 3).  
  - If VOWEL is incorrect, feedback will confirm:  
    - Whether V is in the word (and if at position 1).  
    - Whether W is in the word (and if at position 3).  
  - This maximizes information gain, as W is a plausible letter for position 3 (based on common words), and V is a strong candidate for position 1.  
- **Why not BOWEL?**  
  - B is also a valid candidate for position 1, but VOWEL is prioritized here for its higher frequency in English and to test W explicitly. If VOWEL fails, BOWEL can be the next logical guess.  
- **Other letters?**  
  - No other common 5-letter words fit `_ O _ E L` with the available letters (e.g., J, U, or Y in position 1 or 3 are rare and form invalid words like JOWEL or FOYER, which don't match the pattern or use eliminated letters).  

### Expected Outcome
- If VOWEL is correct, the game ends.  
- If not, feedback on V and W will pinpoint the exact word (e.g., if V is absent, BOWEL becomes the top candidate; if W is absent, rarer options like COWEL or FOWEL may be considered, but BOWEL is more likely).

Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters to maximize information.\nCommon letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).\n\nA good starting word is often one that has a mix of common vowels and consonants. For example, ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"". I recall that ""RAISE"" is a popular starter because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n\nAlternatively, ""CRANE"" is another good one. But let\'s choose ""RAISE"" because it includes the vowel \'I\' in addition to \'A\' and \'E\'. \n\nSo, first guess: RAISE.\n\nBut note: We must output in the specified format.\n\nLet me output: \n<guess>RAISE</guess>For the first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants. This helps identify which letters are present in the secret word and their positions. \n\nI selected ""RAISE"" because:\n- It includes 3 common vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).\n- Letters like R, S, and E are statistically frequent in English words.\n- This combination offers broad coverage to interpret feedback efficiently (e.g., reveals potential ✓, -, or x patterns).\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, the secret word does not contain R, A, I, or S. But it does contain the letter E, but not in the last position.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the letter E in one of the first four positions (positions 1 to 4, since position 5 is where we had E and it was wrong).\n\nWe know the word has E, and we know it doesn\'t have R, A, I, S.\n\nWe need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Includes E (to try to find its correct position) and\n- Uses other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet (since R, A, I, S are out).\n\nWe also avoid using R, A, I, S because they are not in the word.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nWe know E is in the word, so we can try to put E in a different position. Since in ""RAISE"" it was at the end (position 5) and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test multiple new letters and also try to place E in a new position.\n\nA good strategy is to use a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters that we haven\'t eliminated.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have E and avoid R, A, I, S.\n\nPossible letters: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.\n\nVowels: We know A and I are out, but O and U are still possible.\n\nA good candidate might be a word like ""CLOUD"", but that doesn\'t have E. We need to include E.\n\nAnother idea: ""HOUSE"" but H, O, U, S, E -> but S is out, so not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid S.\n\nHow about ""THREE""? But that has 5 letters? No, ""THREE"" is 6 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\nLet\'s think of 5-letter words with E and without R, A, I, S.\n\nSome options:\n- ""EVENT"": E, V, E, N, T -> but we have two E\'s? The secret word might have two E\'s? We don\'t know. But we can try. However, we have to consider that the feedback for E was only one occurrence (since we had one E and it was marked as present but wrong position). But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us about multiple occurrences. So the word might have more than one E? But in our guess, if we use two E\'s, we might get confusing feedback? Actually, it\'s okay because the feedback will mark each occurrence.\n\nBut we know that at least one E is present. If we use two E\'s, we might find out if there are two.\n\nBut let\'s avoid complexity for now and try to use one E and four new letters.\n\nWe can try to put E at the beginning? For example, words starting with E.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid R, A, I, S.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""ENDOW"": E, N, D, O, W -> no R,A,I,S.\n- ""EJECT"": E, J, E, C, T -> has two E\'s and J is uncommon.\n- ""ELBOW"": E, L, B, O, W -> no R,A,I,S.\n\nBut we also want to cover common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""OUNCE"" -> O, U, N, C, E -> E at the end? But in the first guess, E was at the end and was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put E at the end again, and if the secret word has E at the end, it would be marked as correct (✓). But if it\'s not at the end, then we get more information.\n\nBut we know that E is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at the end again, it will still be wrong position? Unless the secret word has two E\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo maximize information, we should try E in a different position. Since it was at position 5 and wrong, we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nLet me list some words without R,A,I,S and with E in a different position.\n\nPosition 1: \n- ""ELITE"" -> but has I (which is out) and T, E -> I is not allowed because we know I is not in the word.\nWe must avoid I.\n\nSo no I.\n\nPosition 1: \n- ""EJECT"" -> has E, J, E, C, T -> but J is uncommon and we have two E\'s.\n- ""EVERY"" -> has R (out) and Y.\n- ""EXERT"" -> has R and X.\n\nAvoid R.\n\nBetter: ""EVENT"" -> E, V, E, N, T -> has two E\'s and V, N, T. But we can use it? We don\'t know if V, N, T are in the word.\n\nBut we are trying to test new letters.\n\nAnother: ""ENEMY"" -> E, N, E, M, Y -> two E\'s and N, M, Y.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\n""OUNCE"" has E at the end, which we know is wrong. So if we put E at the end again, we might not get new information about E\'s position. But we can test other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can put E at position 1: ""EDGED"" -> two E\'s and D, G -> but G and D are good, but two E\'s and repeated D? Not ideal.\n\n""ETHIC"" -> has H, C, but also I (which is out) -> invalid because I is not in the word and we can\'t use it.\n\nWe must use only letters that are not eliminated? No, we can use any letters, but we know that R, A, I, S are not in the word, so using them would be wasteful because they will be marked as x and we get no new information. So we should avoid using R, A, I, S.\n\nSo, back to ""ELBOW"": E (position1), L, B, O, W. This uses E in position 1 and new letters: L, B, O, W.\n\nAnother option: ""MEDLEY"" -> 6 letters, too long.\n\n""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. This is good because we are trying E in a new position (position 2). And letters B, L, O, W are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""GLOBE"": G, L, O, B, E -> E at the end, which we know is wrong.\n\nSo ""BELOW"" seems better because E is in position 2.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CELLO"" -> C, E, L, L, O -> but has two L\'s? And E at position 2. But we can use it? However, repeated letters might not be ideal for information.\n\n""BLOKE"": B, L, O, K, E -> E at the end, same as before.\n\n""DEMON"": D, E, M, O, N -> E at position 2, and letters D, M, O, N.\n\nThis seems good: common letters D, M, O, N.\n\nSimilarly, ""LEMON"": L, E, M, O, N -> E at position 2, but L is also common.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe also have to consider that we are trying to find the position of E.\n\nSince E was not at position 5, and we try it at position 2, if it is correct, we get a ✓. If not, we know it\'s not at 2, and we can try other positions.\n\nMoreover, we get information about D, M, O, N.\n\nSo ""DEMON"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother one: ""HONEY"" -> H, O, N, E, Y -> E at position 4. That\'s also a new position.\n\nBut Y is less common.\n\n""POUND"" -> no E, so not useful.\n\n""FLOUT"" -> no E.\n\nSo between ""BELOW"", ""DEMON"", ""HONEY"", I think ""DEMON"" is better because it has more common consonants.\n\nWe can also consider ""TONED"": T, O, N, E, D -> E at position 4. This is also good.\n\nBut let\'s choose one that has E in a position we haven\'t tried. We tried position 5, so positions 1,2,3,4 are open.\n\nI think ""DEMON"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has any of these letters, but we are trying to cover ground.\n\nAnother word: ""MOUNT"" -> no E.\n\n""COULD"" -> no E.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""DEMON"".\n\nBut let me confirm: D, E, M, O, N. No R, A, I, S. E is at position 2.\n\nWe can also consider ""BONEY"" -> B, O, N, E, Y -> but Y is less common.\n\n""CONED"" -> C, O, N, E, D -> E at position 4.\n\nBut ""DEMON"" is a common word.\n\nAlternatively, ""EVENT"" has two E\'s, which might be useful? But we don\'t know if there are two E\'s.\n\nBut let\'s stick with one E for now.\n\nI think ""DEMON"" is a good second guess.\n\nSo, second guess: DEMON\n\nBut note: we have to output in the format.\n\n<guess>DEMON</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word (all marked ""x"").\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- We must avoid using R, A, I, S since they are eliminated.\n- We need to include E (as it is confirmed in the word) but in a new position (not position 5) to test its location.\n- We should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, D, M) to maximize information gain.\n\nThe word ""DEMON"" fits well:\n- Includes E in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: D, M, O, N (all untested and frequent in English).\n- Avoids eliminated letters (R, A, I, S).\n\nThis guess will help identify:\n- If E is in position 2 (✓) or elsewhere (-).\n- Which of D, M, O, N are present and their positions.\n\n<guess>DEMON</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: DEMON -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given two pieces of feedback:\n\nFirst guess: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nThis means:\n- R, A, I, S are not in the secret word at all.\n- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (since it was guessed at position 5).\n\nSecond guess: DEMON -> D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x)\nSo:\n- D is not in the word (x)\n- E is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2)\n- M is not in the word (x)\n- O is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was guessed at position 4)\n- N is not in the word (x)\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\nEliminated letters (not in secret word): R, A, I, S, D, M, N\n(From Guess 1: R, A, I, S; from Guess 2: D, M, N)\n\nConfirmed letters in the word: E and O\n- E is in the word but not in position 2 or 5 (from Guess 1 E was guessed at position 5, not correct; Guess 2 at position 2, not correct). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n- O is in the word but not in position 4 (from Guess 2, where it was at position 4). So O is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nWe need to guess a word that:\n- Contains E and O (since both are confirmed)\n- Avoids eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, D, M, N\n- We must consider possible positions for E and O.\n\nAlso, we should try to deduce the positions.\n\nFor E: Must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).\nFor O: Must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4).\n\nNow, let\'s think of common 5-letter words with E and O, avoiding eliminated letters.\n\nEliminated: R, A, I, S, D, M, N\n\nAvailable letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and E (but E and O are already included).\n\nWe need to use E and O, and three other letters from the available set.\n\nBut note: We also want to test new letters to gain more information.\n\nPossible words:\n\nFirst, considering E position and O position.\n\nLet\'s list words that have E and O.\n\nFor example, ""PROBE"" but has R (out) and P, B, E? R is eliminated.\n\n""CLOSE"" but has S (out).\n\n""NOTE"" but N is out, and it\'s only 4 letters? 5-letter words.\n\n""STORE"" has S (out) and R (out).\n\n""HOUSE"" has S (out).\n\n""LOUSE"" has S (out) and L? L is available.\n\nL is available, so perhaps we can use words with L.\n\n""LOTUS"" but has S (out).\n\n""POWER"" has R (out).\n\n""BOXER"" has R and X? But R is out.\n\nLet\'s avoid R.\n\n""OUNCE"" has N (out) and C, E? N is eliminated.\n\n""OZONE"" has two O\'s and Z? Z is rare.\n\n""EBONY"" has B, O, N (N is out), Y? N is eliminated.\n\n""FORGE"" has F, O, R (R out), G, E.\n\nR is out.\n\n""BOULE"" has B, O, U, L, E. No eliminated letters? Letters: B, O, U, L, E. Avoids R,A,I,S,D,M,N. So this is possible. And E at position 5? But wait, from first guess, E cannot be at position 5? We have E in ""RAISE"" at position 5 marked as (-) meaning present but wrong position, so position 5 is wrong for E. Then in ""DEMON"" E was at position 2 marked (-), so also wrong.\n\nSo E cannot be at position 5 or 2.\n\nWhat about ""BOULE""? B-O-U-L-E. So E at position 5? But we know E cannot be at position 5 because it was tried and wrong. So if we guess ""BOULE"" and put E at position 5, it will be wrong again.\n\nSo we should avoid putting E at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, we must put E at 1, 3, or 4.\n\nIn ""BOULE"" E is at 5, so not good.\n\nAnother word: ""BELOW"" but has E at position 2? In guess 2 we had DEMON with E at position 2 marked as wrong position. So if E is at 2, it would be wrong again? Unless the position is correct, but we know from DEMON that position 2 is wrong for E.\n\nSo E can\'t be at 2 or 5.\n\nSo E must be at 1, 3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, for O, we know it can\'t be at 4 (from DEMON).\n\nNow, let\'s think of words that have E and O, with O not at 4, and E at 1,3, or 4.\n\nPosition possibilities:\n\n- If E at position 1: then the word starts with E.\n- If E at position 3: E in the middle.\n- If E at position 4: fourth letter is E.\n\nAnd O can be at 1,2,3,5.\n\nBut note we have to avoid contradictions.\n\nFor example, if E is at position 1, then O cannot be at position 1? Because only one letter per position. So O must be at 2,3, or 5.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nNow, let\'s list possible words:\n\nFirst, E at position 1:\n\nWords like: E _ _ _ _, with O somewhere and avoiding eliminated letters.\n\nFor example: ""ELECT"" but has L,E,C,T? But ""ELECT"" has two E\'s? E, L, E, C, T? But position 1 and 3 are E? But we don\'t know if double E is allowed. But also, C and T are available.\n\nBut O is missing? We need O in the word.\n\nSo must include O.\n\n""EBOOK"" but B,O,O,K? Two O\'s? And K. But O must be present? We have O, but let\'s see if it fits. Also, ""EBOOK"" is a valid word? Yes. E at position1, B at 2, O at 3, O at 4, K at 5? But O at position4? We know from DEMON that O is not at position4? Because in DEMON, O was at position4 and marked ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not at position4. So it can be at other positions.\n\nBut ""EBOOK"" has O at position3 and position4. Position4 O is the same as what we guessed? We guessed O at position4 in DEMON and it was wrong position. But if the secret word has two O\'s, then O could be at position4? The feedback system: for each letter, it considers if that position is correct or if the letter exists elsewhere.\n\nIn DEMON, position4 had O and it was marked ""-"", meaning that O is in the word but not at position4. This does not preclude the word having multiple O\'s, but at position4 it is not O. So if the secret word has two O\'s, and one is at position4, it might have been marked correctly? But according to the rules, it would be marked ✓ only if exactly in the position. Since it was marked ""-"", it means that position4 is not O, and there is at least one O elsewhere.\n\nSo in ""EBOOK"", O is at position3 and position4. If we use it as a guess, and if the secret word has O at position4, it would be marked ✓ for that position? But we don\'t know if O is at position4 or not.\n\nFrom DEMON feedback, O is not at position4 because it was marked as ""-"", meaning it is present but not at that position. So secretly, O cannot be at position4; it must be in a different position.\n\nTherefore, in any guess, we should not put O at position4.\n\nSimilarly, for E, we should not put it at position2 or 5.\n\nSo back to E at position1: ""EBOOK""? E at1, O at3 and4. But position4 O is not allowed because we know O is not at position4. So putting O at position4 would be wasteful and will be marked as wrong position if the secret word has only one O? But we don\'t know if it has multiple O\'s.\n\nBut since we know that position4 is not O (from feedback), we should avoid putting O at position4 to save a slot.\n\nSo in ""EBOOK"", position4 has O, which we know cannot be correct, so that would likely be ""-"" or even ""x"" if there\'s only one O? But it doesn\'t help us much.\n\nBetter to choose a word where O is in a position we haven\'t tested.\n\nSimilarly for E.\n\nAvailable positions for E: 1,3,4\nFor O: 1,2,3,5 (not 4)\n\nPossible positions:\n\nCase: E at 1, O at 2: E O _ _ _\nWith letters avoiding eliminated ones.\n\nWords: ""EOYEʉ"" not a word.\n\n""EOLITE"" has I (out).\n\nNot common.\n\nE at 1, O at 3: E _ O _ _\nExample: ""ETHOS"" but has H, S (S out).\n\n""EXPOS"" has S and X? S out.\n\n""ELOPS"" not common.\n\nPerhaps E at 1 and O at 5: E _ _ _ O\nWords: ""EMAIL"" has A (out) and I.\n\n""EBOLA"" has A (out) and L.\n\n""ECHO"" is 4 letters? ""ECLAT"" has A.\n\n5-letter words: ""ERGOT"" has R out.\n\n""EMBOW"" but M out.\n\nDifficult.\n\nE at 1, O at 5: E _ _ _ O\nAnd avoid A, I, R, S, D, M, N.\n\nAvailable: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y\n\nSo, for example, ""EBURO"" not a word.\n\n""ECOLO"" not.\n\n""EVER O"" 6 letters.\n\n""ECHOO"" not standard.\n\n""EER O"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""EUROS"" but has S out.\n\nHard to find.\n\nNow, E at 3: _ _ E _ _\n\nWith O somewhere.\n\nE at 3, O at 1: O _ E _ _\nWords: ""OWEre"" not.\n\n""OP e a"" not.\n\n""OAKED"" has A and K, D? D out, A out.\n\n""OBELI"" has I out.\n\n""OCEAN"" has A and C, E? A out.\n\n""OCREA"" not common.\n\nE at 3, O at 2: _ O E _ _\nWords: ""BOWEL"" has B, O, W, E, L -> O at 2, E at 3? Positions:1:B,2:O,3:W,4:E,5:L? No, E is at 4, not 3.\n\n""BOXEN"" has N out.\n\n""COVET"" has C, O, V, E, T -> O at 2, E at 4? Not at 3.\n\nIf E at position 3, then _ _ E _ _\n\nWith O at 2: _ O E _ _\n\nor O at 1: O _ E _ _\n\nor O at 5: _ _ E _ O\n\n Etc.\n\nWord like ""TOPIC"" has I and no E.\n\n""LOVES"" has S out.\n\n""ROLEX"" has R out.\n\n""FOG EY"" not.\n\n""BOGLE"" has B, O, G, L, E -> positions:1:B,2:O,3:G,4:L,5:E -> E at 5, which we cannot.\n\nBut we seel E at 3.\n\n""POWER"" has R out.\n\n""POVEL"" not common.\n\n""JOKED"" has D out.\n\n""JOKE"" is 4 letters.\n\nPerhaps ""TOKED"" has D out.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nE at position 4: _ _ _ E _\n\nWith O somewhere.\n\nFor example, O at 1: O _ _ E _\n\nOr O at 2: _ O _ E _\n\nOr O at 3: _ _ O E _\n\nOr O at 5: _ _ _ E O\n\nAnd avoid eliminated letters.\n\nAvailable letters include B, C, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, U, V, W, Y\n\nFor instance, ""USED"" has S, D out.\n\n""PAGED"" has A, G, E, D? D out.\n\n""A"" is out.\n\n""OLE  "" not.\n\n""OPEN  "" not.\n\n"" OKE E"" not.\n\n""BUOYE"" not.\n\n""OWLET"" has O, W, L, E, T -> positions:1:O,2:W,3:L,4:E,5:T -> E at position 4, which is possible (E can be at 4). O at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, ""BOW E"" not.\n\n""OWLET"" is a word: a small owl. Yes, valid.\n\nLetters: O, W, L, E, T. All available? O, W, L, E, T. Avoids R,A,I,S,D,M,N.\n\nE is at position 4, which is allowed (position 4 possible for E).\n\nO is at position 1, which is allowed (not position 4).\n\nWe are testing O at position 1 and E at position 4.\n\nAdditionally, we test new letters W, L, T.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nAnother candidate: ""O ft E n"" not.\n\n"" OVULE"" but has U, L, E? O, V, U, L, E. E at position 5? Position 5 not allowed for E.\n\n"" OTT E R"" too long.\n\n""OWLET"" seems solid.\n\nOther words with E at 4 and O at 1? ""OFTEN"" has F, T, E, N?

In DEMON, O was at position 4 and marked ""-"", but position 2 is new.\n\nSimilarly, we tested E at position 5 and 2, not 4.\n\nSo ""HOTEL"" is also a possibility.\n\nE at 4 and O at 2.\n\nAnother common word with E and O: ""WHOLE"" W,H,O,L,E -> positions:1:W,2:H,3:O,4:L,5:E -> E at 5, not allowed.\n\n""TONEL"" N out.\n\n""BUTlE"" not.\n\nSo between ""OWLET"" and ""HOTEL"", both are valid.\n\n""OWLET"" has O at 1, E at 4.\n""HOTEL"" has O at 2, E at 4.\n\nWe might prefer one that tests a position for E we haven\'t tried.

HOTEL: 1:H, 2:O, 3:T, 4:E, 5:L -> yes E at 4.\n\nO at position 2.\n\nBoth un tested positions for these letters.\n\nPerfect.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- From GUESS 1 (RAISE): Letters R, A, I, S are not in the secret word (all marked ""x""). E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").\n- From GUESS 2 (DEMON): Letters D, M, N are not in the secret word (all marked ""x""). E is in the word but not in position 2 (marked ""-""). O is in the word but not in position 4 (marked ""-"").\n\nConsolidated known information:\n- **Eliminated letters (not in the word)**: R, A, I, S, D, M, N\n- **Confirmed present letters**: E and O, with positional constraints:\n  - E must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).\n  - O must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4).\n- **Goal for next guess**: Test new letters to gather more information while incorporating E and O in valid positions. Avoid using eliminated letters.\n\nFor this guess:\n- Selected ""HOTEL"" (a valid 5-letter word) because:\n  - Includes E (position 4) and O (position 2), respecting positional constraints.\n  - Tests new common letters (H, T, L) not yet evaluated.\n  - Avoids all eliminated letters (R, A, I, S, D, M, N are absent).\n- Expected information gain:\n  - Confirms if E is in position 4 and O is in position 2.\n  - Reveals presence/absence of H, T, L and their positions if present.\n- Alternative considered: ""OWLET"" (O in position 1, E in position 4), but ""HOTEL"" was chosen for higher letter frequency coverage.\n\n<guess>HOTEL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: DEMON -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x)\nGuess 3: HOTEL -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) L(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n  Meaning: R, A, I, S are not in the word.

So available: B, C, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but these are the main ones).\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWe have two positions to guess: position 1 and position 3.\n\nWe should choose a word that fits the pattern and uses common letters to maximize the chance of getting information.\n\nBut note: we have only two unknowns, so we might be able to guess the word.\n\nWe can try to think of words that match _ O _ E L\n\nCommon words:\n- MODEL -> but M is eliminated (from Guess 2)\n- HOTEL -> we already tried, and H and T are out\n- NOVEL -> N is out, and V? But N eliminated\n- JEWEL -> J, E, W, E, L? But pattern: J O ? E L? No, it\'s J E W E L -> positions don\'t match: position2 is E, but we need O at position2? No, in our pattern, position2 is O, but in JEWEL, position2 is E.\n\nWe need the second letter to be O and fourth to be E, fifth to be L.\n\nSo: \nPosition1: ?\nPosition2: O\nPosition3: ?\nPosition4: E\nPosition5: L\n\nSo words like:\n- BOXEL? Not a word.\n- COWEL? COWEL is a word (a type of cowl or hood), but let\'s check: C O W E L -> positions: C at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, L at5. Yes, that fits.\n- FOWEL? Not common, but F O W E L? Not a standard word.\n- JOWEL? J O W E L -> JEWEL is J E W E L, not J O W E L.\n- VOWEL: V O W E L -> V at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, L at5. Yes, ""vowel"" is a word.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- DOWEL: D O W E L -> but D is eliminated (from Guess 2).\n- TOWEL: T O W E L -> but T is eliminated (from Guess 3).\n- BOWEL: B O W E L -> B at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, L at5. Valid word.\n\nSo possible words: VOWEL, BOWEL, COWEL (if accepted).\n\nBut COWEL might be variant spelling, but typically it\'s COWL (4 letters) or COWLED. COWEL is not standard. Let\'s stick to common words.\n\nAlso, GOLEM? G O L E M -> but then position3 is L, but position5 is M? And pattern is _ O _ E L, so position5 must be L, but in GOLEM it\'s M. So no.\n\nJOULE: J O U L E -> positions: J at1, O at2, U at3, L at4, E at5. But we need E at4 and L at5, but here L is at4 and E at5. So not matching.\n\nSo the pattern must have E at4 and L at5.\n\nOther words: HOWEL? H is out, and not common.\n\nPOWEL? Not common.\n\nSo the common ones are: VOWEL and BOWEL.\n\nAlso, FOWEL? Not standard.\n\nWe can consider ""rowel"" but R is out.\n\nSo between VOWEL and BOWEL.\n\nWe have to choose one as our guess.\n\nBut note: we have two unknowns, so we can guess one and if wrong, the next.\n\nBut we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more letters? But we only have two positions.\n\nWe could guess a word that has both possibilities? But we have to use the known positions.\n\nSince we know O, E, L are fixed, we can only vary position1 and position3.\n\nIn VOWEL: position1 is V, position3 is W.\nIn BOWEL: position1 is B, position3 is W.\n\nBoth have W at position3? \n- VOWEL: V O W E L -> position3 is W\n- BOWEL: B O W E L -> position3 is W\n\nSo both have W at position3? Then what\'s the difference? Only position1: V vs B.\n\nBut we don\'t know if W is in the word? We haven\'t tested W.\n\nIn the pattern, position3 is unknown, so it could be W.\n\nBut we don\'t know if W is in the word.\n\nWe can guess a word that has W at position3 and then test position1.\n\nBut we have to choose a word.\n\nWe can guess ""VOWEL"" or ""BOWEL"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there are other words.\n\nWhat about ""COWED""? But position5 is D, not L, and D is out.\n\n""JOWLY""? J O W L Y -> position4 is L, but we need E at4? And position5 is Y. Not matching.\n\n""LOWED""? L at position1? But then position5 is D, out.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother word: ""POWEL"" is not standard. ""POWDER"" too long.\n\n""TOWED"" has T out and D out.\n\nSo VOWEL and BOWEL are the main candidates.\n\nBut note: in both, position3 is W. So if we guess one of them, we can confirm if W is at position3.\n\nBut we don\'t know if W is in the word.\n\nWe could guess a word that doesn\'t assume W, but we have to fill position3 with something.\n\nFor example, could position3 be something else?\n\nWhat other words fit _ O _ E L?\n\nWith available letters.\n\nFor instance:\n- FOYER? F O Y E R -> but R is out, and position5 is R, not L? We need L at5.\n- GOYER? Not a word.\n- BOYER? B O Y E R -> R out.\n- COYER? C O Y E R -> R out.\n- HOPER? H out, R out.\n- POPE L? Not.\n- COPEL? Not common.\n- GEMEL? G E M E L -> but position2 is E, not O.\n\nSo it seems that W is common in that position.\n\nAnother word: ""DOWLE"" but D out and not common.\n\n""NOWEL"" N out.\n\nSo probably W is the most likely.\n\nBut we also have ""JOULE"" but doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\nOr ""VOTEL"" not a word.\n\nSo let\'s consider VOWEL and BOWEL.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nBut to be safe, we might guess a word that tests a different letter for position3, but we don\'t have many options.\n\nWe could guess a word that has a different letter at position3 to test.\n\nFor example, suppose we guess ""COGEL"" but not a word.\n\n""FOGEL"" not.\n\n""POKEL"" not.\n\nSo it\'s hard.\n\nAnother idea: ""BOXER"" but R out and X? And position4 E? Not.\n\nSo I think VOWEL or BOWEL are the choices.\n\nWe can look at letter frequency.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we have.\n\nWe know that in the word, we have O, E, L, and two more letters.\n\nWe don\'t have any information about position1 and position3 except that they are from the available set.\n\nWe can guess ""VOWEL"" to test V and W.\n\nIf it\'s not, then we can guess ""BOWEL"" next.\n\nBut we have two tries left? We have used 3, so 3 more? But we might solve it.\n\nSince both have W at position3, if we guess one and W is not in the word, we know both are wrong.\n\nBut if W is in the word at position3, then we only need to find position1.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nWe can guess a word that doesn\'t use W, but we don\'t have a common word.\n\nFor example, ""JOULE"" doesn\'t fit.\n\n""BOULE"" B O U L E -> but position4 is L, not E, and position5 is E, not L? We need E at4 and L at5.\n\nIn ""BOULE"": B at1, O at2, U at3, L at4, E at5 -> but we need L at5 and E at4, so not.\n\n""POULE"" same.\n\n""COULE"" not.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother word: ""GOFER"" G O F E R -> R out.\n\nNot.\n\nSo I think we have to go with W at position3.\n\nNow, between VOWEL and BOWEL, which one to choose?\n\nWe can consider which letters are more common.\n\nBut V and B are both possible.\n\nWe can look at the feedback from previous guesses to see if there\'s a hint, but I don\'t think so.\n\nWe can choose ""VOWEL"" because it\'s a common word.\n\nOr ""BOWEL"" is also common.\n\nBut let\'s see the eliminated letters: we have many, so the secret word is likely to be one of these.\n\nWe can guess ""VOWEL"".\n\nBut note: we have to output the guess.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""VOWEL"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: V O W E L -> position2:O (correct), position4:E (correct), position5:L (correct). And position1:V, position3:W.\n\nIf it\'s not, then we try BOWEL next.\n\nBut we have only 3 guesses left? We have used 3, so 3 more, but we can solve.\n\nAnother word: ""HOWEL"" not common, H out.\n\n""LOWER"" L at position1? But then position5 is R, out.\n\nSo I think VOWEL is a good guess.\n\nSo <guess>VOWEL</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\n- **Guess 1: RAISE**  \n  Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - E is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\n- **Guess 2: DEMON**  \n  Feedback: D(x), E(-), M(x), O(-), N(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - D, M, N are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - E is in the word but **not in position 2**.  \n  - O is in the word but **not in position 4**.\n\n- **Guess 3: HOTEL**  \n  Feedback: H(x), O(✓), T(x), E(✓), L(✓)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - H and T are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - O is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2**.  \n  - E is in the word and **correctly placed in position 4**.  \n  - L is in the word and **correctly placed in position 5**.\n\n### Consolidated Information\n- **Eliminated Letters (not in the word)**: R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T (from all feedback).  \n- **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:  \n  - Position 2: O (✓)  \n  - Position 4: E (✓)  \n  - Position 5: L (✓)  \n- **Unknown Positions**:  \n  - Position 1: Unknown letter (must be one of the remaining available letters).  \n  - Position 3: Unknown letter (must be one of the remaining available letters).  \n- **Available Letters**: B, C, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (since R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T are eliminated).  \n- **Word Pattern**: The secret word must match the pattern `_ O _ E L` (e.g., position 1: unknown, position 2: O, position 3: unknown, position 4: E, position 5: L).  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess\n- The secret word is now narrowed to the pattern `_ O _ E L`, with only positions 1 and 3 unknown.  \n- Common English words fitting this pattern include:  \n  - **VOWEL** (V at position 1, W at position 3)  \n  - **BOWEL** (B at position 1, W at position 3)  \n  - Less common options like **COWEL** (C at position 1, W at position 3) are possible but less frequent.  \n- **Why choose VOWEL?**  \n  - It tests two new, relatively common letters: V (position 1) and W (position 3).  \n  - If VOWEL is incorrect, feedback will confirm:  \n    - Whether V is in the word (and if at position 1).  \n    - Whether W is in the word (and if at position 3).  \n  - This maximizes information gain, as W is a plausible letter for position 3 (based on common words), and V is a strong candidate for position 1.  \n- **Why not BOWEL?**  \n  - B is also a valid candidate for position 1, but VOWEL is prioritized here for its higher frequency in English and to test W explicitly. If VOWEL fails, BOWEL can be the next logical guess.  \n- **Other letters?**  \n  - No other common 5-letter words fit `_ O _ E L` with the available letters (e.g., J, U, or Y in position 1 or 3 are rare and form invalid words like JOWEL or FOYER, which don\'t match the pattern or use eliminated letters).  \n\n### Expected Outcome\n- If VOWEL is correct, the game ends.  \n- If not, feedback on V and W will pinpoint the exact word (e.g., if V is absent, BOWEL becomes the top candidate; if W is absent, rarer options like COWEL or FOWEL may be considered, but BOWEL is more likely).\n\n<guess>VOWEL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: DEMON -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) M(x) O(-) N(x)\nGuess 3: HOTEL -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) L(✓)\nGuess 4: VOWEL -> FEEDBACK: V(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the fourth guess: VOWEL -> V(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) L(✓)

This means:
- V is not in the word (x)
- O is correct and in position 2 (✓)
- W is correct and in position 3 (✓)
- E is correct and in position 4 (✓)
- L is correct and in position 5 (✓)

So the secret word has the form: _ O W E L

We know the second, third, fourth, and fifth letters: O, W, E, L.

Only the first letter is missing.

From previous feedback, we have eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T, V (from guesses 1,2,3,4)

Eliminated: R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T, V

Available letters for the first position: B, C, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that starts with one of these and then O, W, E, L.

The word must be: [letter] O W E L

What are possible words?

- BOWEL: B O W E L -> B is available? Yes, not eliminated.
- COWEL: C O W E L -> C is available.
- DOWEL: D is eliminated (from guess 2), so not.
- FOWEL: Not a common word, but F O W E L? We can consider if it exists, but typically not standard.
- GOWEL: Not a word.
- JOWEL: Not standard; JEWEL is J E W E L, not matching.
- HOWEL: H is eliminated.
- LOWEL: L is at the end, but position1 L? Then the word would be L O W E L, but that has two L's? And position1 L and position5 L? But we don't know if that's allowed. However, in the feedback, we have L at position5, but we haven't tested L elsewhere. But in the pattern, position1 is unknown, so it could be L? But let's see: if the word is LOWEL, then positions: L at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, L at5. So L at position1 and position5. But in previous guesses, we had L only at position5 in HOTEL and VOWEL, and it was marked correct at position5, but that doesn't say anything about position1. So it could be possible? But we need to check if it's a word. ""Lowel"" is not a common English word. It might be a name or something, but not in word lists typically.

Common words: 
- BOWEL: part of the digestive system.
- COWEL: less common, but can be a variant of cowl? Or a surname? Not standard.

Another: POWEL? Not common.

ROWEL: R is eliminated.

TOWEL: T is eliminated.

VOWEL: we tried, V is out.

So the only common word left is BOWEL.

But let's confirm: B O W E L.

B is not eliminated? From the list, B is still available.

We haven't used B in any guess, and it's not in the eliminated list.

Eliminated: R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T, V.

B is not in that list.

So BOWEL should be the word.

We could have other rare words, but BOWEL is the most likely.

So we should guess BOWEL.

But note: in the pattern, we have O, W, E, L fixed, so only position1 to guess.

And BOWEL fits.

So <guess>BOWEL</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: RAISE**  
  Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word.  
  - E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

- **Guess 2: DEMON**  
  Feedback: D(x), E(-), M(x), O(-), N(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - D, M, N are **not** in the secret word.  
  - E is in the word but **not in position 2**.  
  - O is in the word but **not in position 4**.

- **Guess 3: HOTEL**  
  Feedback: H(x), O(✓), T(x), E(✓), L(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - H and T are **not** in the secret word.  
  - O is **correctly placed in position 2**.  
  - E is **correctly placed in position 4**.  
  - L is **correctly placed in position 5**.  
  - **Secret word pattern**: `_ O _ E L` (positions 2, 4, and 5 are confirmed).

- **Guess 4: VOWEL**  
  Feedback: V(x), O(✓), W(✓), E(✓), L(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - V is **not** in the secret word.  
  - O, W, E, L are **correctly placed** (positions 2, 3, 4, 5).  
  - **Secret word pattern updated**: `_ O W E L` (only position 1 is unknown).

### Consolidated Information
- **Eliminated Letters (not in the word)**: R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T, V (from all feedback).  
- **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:  
  - Position 2: O (✓)  
  - Position 3: W (✓)  
  - Position 4: E (✓)  
  - Position 5: L (✓)  
- **Unknown Position**: Position 1 (must be a letter not eliminated).  
- **Available Letters for Position 1**: B, C, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z.  
- **Secret Word Pattern**: `[position 1] O W E L`.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- The secret word is **fully determined except for position 1**, and the pattern `_ O W E L` matches common English words like **BOWEL** or **COWEL**.  
- **BOWEL** is the most frequent and plausible word fitting this pattern:  
  - B is an available letter (not eliminated).  
  - ""Bowel"" is a valid English word (meaning part of the digestive system).  
- **Why BOWEL?**  
  - It tests the only unknown position (position 1) with a high-frequency consonant (B).  
  - If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, feedback on B will confirm if it is in the word (though unlikely, as position 1 is the only unknown).  
- **No other common options**:  
  - **COWEL** is less common (variant of ""cowl"") and less likely.  
  - Other combinations (e.g., F, G, or J in position 1) do not form valid English words (e.g., FOWEL, GOWEL, JOWEL are invalid).  

<guess>BOWEL</guess>",BOWEL,"We have the feedback from the fourth guess: VOWEL -> V(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) L(✓)

This means:
- V is not in the word (x)
- O is correct and in position 2 (✓)
- W is correct and in position 3 (✓)
- E is correct and in position 4 (✓)
- L is correct and in position 5 (✓)

So the secret word has the form: _ O W E L

We know the second, third, fourth, and fifth letters: O, W, E, L.

Only the first letter is missing.

From previous feedback, we have eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T, V (from guesses 1,2,3,4)

Eliminated: R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T, V

Available letters for the first position: B, C, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that starts with one of these and then O, W, E, L.

The word must be: [letter] O W E L

What are possible words?

- BOWEL: B O W E L -> B is available? Yes, not eliminated.
- COWEL: C O W E L -> C is available.
- DOWEL: D is eliminated (from guess 2), so not.
- FOWEL: Not a common word, but F O W E L? We can consider if it exists, but typically not standard.
- GOWEL: Not a word.
- JOWEL: Not standard; JEWEL is J E W E L, not matching.
- HOWEL: H is eliminated.
- LOWEL: L is at the end, but position1 L? Then the word would be L O W E L, but that has two L's? And position1 L and position5 L? But we don't know if that's allowed. However, in the feedback, we have L at position5, but we haven't tested L elsewhere. But in the pattern, position1 is unknown, so it could be L? But let's see: if the word is LOWEL, then positions: L at1, O at2, W at3, E at4, L at5. So L at position1 and position5. But in previous guesses, we had L only at position5 in HOTEL and VOWEL, and it was marked correct at position5, but that doesn't say anything about position1. So it could be possible? But we need to check if it's a word. ""Lowel"" is not a common English word. It might be a name or something, but not in word lists typically.

Common words: 
- BOWEL: part of the digestive system.
- COWEL: less common, but can be a variant of cowl? Or a surname? Not standard.

Another: POWEL? Not common.

ROWEL: R is eliminated.

TOWEL: T is eliminated.

VOWEL: we tried, V is out.

So the only common word left is BOWEL.

But let's confirm: B O W E L.

B is not eliminated? From the list, B is still available.

We haven't used B in any guess, and it's not in the eliminated list.

Eliminated: R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T, V.

B is not in that list.

So BOWEL should be the word.

We could have other rare words, but BOWEL is the most likely.

So we should guess BOWEL.

But note: in the pattern, we have O, W, E, L fixed, so only position1 to guess.

And BOWEL fits.

- **Guess 1: RAISE**  
  Feedback: R(x), A(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - R, A, I, S are **not** in the secret word.  
  - E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

- **Guess 2: DEMON**  
  Feedback: D(x), E(-), M(x), O(-), N(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - D, M, N are **not** in the secret word.  
  - E is in the word but **not in position 2**.  
  - O is in the word but **not in position 4**.

- **Guess 3: HOTEL**  
  Feedback: H(x), O(✓), T(x), E(✓), L(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - H and T are **not** in the secret word.  
  - O is **correctly placed in position 2**.  
  - E is **correctly placed in position 4**.  
  - L is **correctly placed in position 5**.  
  - **Secret word pattern**: `_ O _ E L` (positions 2, 4, and 5 are confirmed).

- **Guess 4: VOWEL**  
  Feedback: V(x), O(✓), W(✓), E(✓), L(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - V is **not** in the secret word.  
  - O, W, E, L are **correctly placed** (positions 2, 3, 4, 5).  
  - **Secret word pattern updated**: `_ O W E L` (only position 1 is unknown).

### Consolidated Information
- **Eliminated Letters (not in the word)**: R, A, I, S, D, M, N, H, T, V (from all feedback).  
- **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:  
  - Position 2: O (✓)  
  - Position 3: W (✓)  
  - Position 4: E (✓)  
  - Position 5: L (✓)  
- **Unknown Position**: Position 1 (must be a letter not eliminated).  
- **Available Letters for Position 1**: B, C, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z.  
- **Secret Word Pattern**: `[position 1] O W E L`.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- The secret word is **fully determined except for position 1**, and the pattern `_ O W E L` matches common English words like **BOWEL** or **COWEL**.  
- **BOWEL** is the most frequent and plausible word fitting this pattern:  
  - B is an available letter (not eliminated).  
  - ""Bowel"" is a valid English word (meaning part of the digestive system).  
- **Why BOWEL?**  
  - It tests the only unknown position (position 1) with a high-frequency consonant (B).  
  - If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, feedback on B will confirm if it is in the word (though unlikely, as position 1 is the only unknown).  
- **No other common options**:  
  - **COWEL** is less common (variant of ""cowl"") and less likely.  
  - Other combinations (e.g., F, G, or J in position 1) do not form valid English words (e.g., FOWEL, GOWEL, JOWEL are invalid).",Guess 5: BOWEL -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
