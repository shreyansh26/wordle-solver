We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word often uses common letters and has a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 3 consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E) which are common.
   - It has unique letters to avoid duplication.

 So, our first guess will be ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(✓), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 1).
 - R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (it must be in one of the other positions: 1,3,4,5? but note position 1 is already C, so R must be in 3,4, or 5).
 - A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 4 or 5, since position 1 is C and position 2 is not A because it's marked as wrong position? Actually, note: the feedback for R is '-' meaning it's in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3).
 - N and E are not in the word at all.

 So, we know:
   Position 1: C (fixed)
   The word contains: C, R, A (and two more letters, since N and E are absent)
   The word does not contain: N, E.

 Also, note that R and A are present but not in the positions we guessed (2 and 3 respectively). Therefore:
   R must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But wait, position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. So positions available for R: 3,4,5.
   Similarly, A must be in position 2,4,5? But note: we guessed A in position 3 and it was wrong, so A cannot be in position 3. Also, position 1 is C, so A cannot be there. Therefore, A must be in position 2,4, or 5.

 However, we must also consider that the word has 5 letters and we have three known letters: C, R, A.

 We have two more letters to discover, and they are not N or E.

 Now, for the next guess, we want to try to place R and A in different positions and also try to find the remaining letters.

 Constraints for the next guess:
   - Must be a 5-letter English word.
   - Must start with C (because position 1 is fixed as C and correct).
   - Must include R and A (because they are in the secret word) but in positions different from the first guess for the ones that were marked wrong (so R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3).
   - Must not include N or E.

 We can try to form a word that starts with C, and then put R and A in positions that are allowed.

 Let's think of words that start with C and have R and A, and avoid N and E.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 Possible positions for R: 3,4,5
 Possible positions for A: 2,4,5

 But note: we cannot put R in position 2 again (we already tried and it was wrong) and A in position 3 (tried and wrong).

 We can try to put A in position 2? That would be a new position for A. And R in position 4 or 5? Or we can try R in position 3 and A in position 4? etc.

 Let's list some words:

 Option 1: Put A in position 2 and R in position 4? Then we have: C A _ R _
 But we need to fill the 3rd and 5th letters. We cannot use N or E.

 What words? For example: 
   CAR? ... but we need 5 letters.

 Let's try: 
   CARAT? But that has T which is new. Also, note: we have A in position 2 and 5? But we only know one A is in the word? Actually, the word might have two A's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates.

 However, in our first guess we had only one A. So if the secret word has two A's, then we would have known? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we guessed one A and it was present (but in wrong position), there could be another A? But we don't know.

 But to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters.

 However, for now, let's assume we don't know. We can try a word that has A in position 2 and R in position 4.

 Example: ""CARAT"" -> C A R A T? But wait, we have R in position 3? We want to avoid putting R in position 2 (which we did) but we are putting R in position 3? That's allowed because we haven't tried R in position 3 yet.

 However, note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put R in position 3, that might be correct? Or it might be in 4 or 5.

 But we also have to avoid putting A in position 3? In this word ""CARAT"", we have A in position 2 and 4? And we have R in position 3.

 Let's check: 
   Position 1: C (correct)
   Position 2: A -> we don't know if it's correct? We haven't tried A in position 2 before.
   Position 3: R -> we haven't tried R in position 3 before? But in the first guess we had R in position 2 and it was wrong, so R is not in 2, but it could be in 3.

 However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have only one R? We don't know.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess: R was marked as present (but wrong position). So if we put R in position 3 in the second guess and it is correct, then we get a check. If it is still wrong, we get a dash.

 Alternatively, we might try to put R in a completely new position (like 5) and A in a new position (like 4) to test.

 We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think of words that start with C, have R and A, and avoid E and N.

 Some words:
   CARTY? (not a word)
   CARDS? -> but has D and S, and also S is new. But note: we have to avoid E and N? D and S are allowed. However, we have to check if the word is valid.

   CARDS: 
      C A R D S
      Position 1: C (correct)
      Position 2: A (we are testing if A is in position 2? but note: in the secret word, A might be in position 2? or not? We don't know. Also, we have R in position 3? which we haven't tested.

   But wait, the secret word has A, but we don't know if it can be in position 2? It could be. Similarly, R could be in position 3.

   However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have A in position 4 or 5? We don't know.

   Another word: CRAWL? But we have R in position 2 again? We cannot do that because we already know R is not in position 2. So we must avoid putting R in position 2.

   So we cannot use words that have R in the second position.

   Therefore, ""CARDS"" is acceptable because R is in position 3? But wait: in ""CARDS"", the positions are:
        C (1), A (2), R (3), D (4), S (5)

   We are testing:
        A in position 2 (which is new for A) and R in position 3 (which is new for R).

   Also, we are introducing two new letters: D and S.

   But note: the feedback for the first guess said that A is in the word but not in position 3. So if the secret word has A in position 2, then that would be correct? And we would get a check for A in position 2.

   However, if the secret word has A in position 4 or 5, then we would get a dash for A in position 2? and then we would know.

   Similarly, for R: if the secret word has R in position 3, we get a check; if it's in 4 or 5, we get a dash.

   This seems like a good word to test.

   But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? For example, what if the secret word has two A's? Then we might get two A's? But in ""CARDS"", we only have one A. So if the secret word has two A's, we might not get full information? However, we are testing one A at position 2 and we know there's at least one A.

   Alternatively, we could try a word that has A in a different position? For example, put A in position 4? 

   Example: ""CURLY"" -> but that has U and L and Y? and R in position 3? and A is missing? We must include A.

   Another example: ""CHARM"" -> 
        C H A R M
        Here, A is in position 3? But we already know that A is not in position 3 (from the first guess). So we cannot put A in position 3.

   So we must avoid position 3 for A? Yes, because the first guess had A in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? Actually, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, it would be wrong again? But we already know that, so it's a waste. We should try A in a new position: 2,4,5.

   Similarly, for R: avoid position 2.

   Therefore, ""CARDS"" is a valid candidate.

   Another candidate: ""CAMPY""? But that has M and P and Y? and no R? We must include R.

   ""CRWTH""? Not a common word and doesn't have A.

   ""CABIN""? But has B, I, N -> but N is not allowed? We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.

   ""CABIN"" is invalid because of N.

   ""CABLE""? But has E -> not allowed.

   ""CAIRD""? Not a common word.

   ""CARET""? But has E -> not allowed.

   ""CAROB""? -> C A R O B: 
        O and B are new. And it avoids E and N.

   So ""CAROB"" is also a candidate.

   Between ""CARDS"" and ""CAROB"", which one is better? 
        ""CARDS"" has D and S, which are common letters.
        ""CAROB"" has O and B.

   We don't know which letters are more common? But we can choose one.

   Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? But we already have A. The secret word might have other vowels? We don't know.

   Since we are avoiding E, and we have A, the remaining vowels could be I, O, U.

   In ""CAROB"", we have O. In ""CARDS"", we have no vowel (except A). So ""CAROB"" might be better to test a vowel.

   But note: we are only allowed to use words that are valid.

   Let me check: both ""CARDS"" and ""CAROB"" are valid words.

   We can choose ""CAROB"" to test the letter O.

   However, we are also testing R in position 3 and A in position 2.

   Another idea: we know the secret word has C in position 1, and then we have two letters R and A to place. We also have two more letters that are not E or N.

   We might try to put R in position 5 and A in position 4? 

   Example: ""C_ _ A R"" -> what words? 
        ""CIVAR""? not a word.
        ""COLAR""? -> C O L A R: that's a word? Actually, ""collar"" is 6 letters. ""COLAR"" is not common.

   ""CIGAR""? -> but has G and I? and also we have A in position 5? Actually, ""CIGAR"": 
        C I G A R -> A is in position 4? and R in position 5.

   But ""CIGAR"" has I and G? and avoids E and N? and is a valid word.

   So we have multiple options: ""CARDS"", ""CAROB"", ""CIGAR"".

   How to choose? We want to maximize the information.

   In ""CARDS"": 
        We test A in position 2 and R in position 3, and also D and S.
   In ""CAROB"": 
        We test A in position 2 and R in position 3, and also O and B.
   In ""CIGAR"": 
        We test A in position 4 and R in position 5, and also I and G.

   Since we don't have any information about the other two letters, any of these are fine.

   But note: we also want to avoid positions that we know are wrong? Actually, we don't know about the other positions yet.

   However, we know that the secret word does not have E and N, so we are avoiding those.

   I think I'll go with ""CARDS"" because it uses common consonants (D and S).

   But let me think: what if the secret word is ""CRAWL""? But wait, we know that R is not in position 2? So ""CRAWL"" would have R in position 2, which we know is wrong. So it cannot be ""CRAWL"".

   Another possibility: the secret word might be ""CRASS""? 
        But in our first guess, we had ""crane"": 
            C (correct), R (wrong position) -> so R must be in the word but not in position 2. In ""CRASS"", R is in position 2? That would be inconsistent.

   So the secret word must have R in position 3,4, or 5.

   Therefore, ""CRASS"" is not possible.

   Similarly, ""CARTY"" is not a word.

   Let me try to think of the secret word: 
        It starts with C, and has R and A, and two other letters (not E, N). And R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.

   Example: ""CHARM""? But A is in position 3? which we know is wrong? So no.

   ""CLASP"": 
        C L A S P -> A is in position 3? not allowed? So no.

   ""CAMPY"": no R.

   ""CATTY"": no R.

   ""CAROM"": C A R O M -> A in position 2, R in position 3? This is a word? Yes, meaning in billiards.

   So ""CAROM"" is a possibility? But we don't know.

   Therefore, we can try ""CARDS"" to test.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put both A and R in the positions we are testing? But we have to include them.

   Another idea: we can try to put A in position 4 and R in position 3? 

   Example: ""CURAT""? Not a common word.

   Or ""CIRCA"": 
        C I R C A -> but has two C's? and we already know C is in position 1. But the secret word might have two C's? We don't know. Also, we are putting C in position 1 and 4? The feedback for the second C? We don't know.

   However, we are forced to include C in position 1? Actually, we don't have to? But the first letter is fixed as C? Because the feedback said C is correct. So the secret word has C in position 1. So we must start with C.

   But in ""CIRCA"", we have C in position 1 and 4? That's allowed. But we are testing:
        Position 1: C (correct)
        Position 2: I (new)
        Position 3: R (we are testing R in position 3)
        Position 4: C (if the secret word has two C's, then it might be correct? but we don't know if there's a second C)
        Position 5: A (we are testing A in position 5)

   However, we know the secret word has at least one C (in position 1) and one R and one A. It might have more?

   But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about the letters we guessed. We guessed one C and it was correct. So if the secret word has two C's, we wouldn't know until we guess a second C.

   But in ""CIRCA"", we are guessing a second C. That might be useful? But we are also introducing I and using A in position 5.

   However, we are avoiding E and N.

   But ""CIRCA"" is a valid word.

   But note: we are putting R in position 3? and A in position 5? which are new positions.

   This is also a candidate.

   Now, we have several candidates: ""CARDS"", ""CAROB"", ""CIGAR"", ""CIRCA"".

   We need to choose one.

   Let's consider the information we get:

   We want to maximize the chance of getting checks and also cover more letters.

   In ""CIRCA"", we are testing two C's? That might be less likely? But we don't know.

   I think I'll go with ""CARDS"" because it uses common letters and we can get information about A in position 2 and R in position 3.

   So let's choose ""CARDS"".

   But note: we must be cautious. The secret word might have A in position 4? Then in ""CARDS"", we would get:
        C (correct) -> ✓
        A (if the secret word has A in position 4, then A in position 2 is wrong) -> so we get a dash? But wait: if the secret word has only one A and it is in position 4, then we would get:
            Position 2: A -> not present? But wait, the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word. So if we put A in position 2 and the secret word has A in position 4, then we should get a dash for A? Because it's in the word but wrong position.

        Similarly, R in position 3: if the secret word has R in position 4, then we get a dash for R? because it's present but not in position 3.

   So we can get two dashes? That would tell us that both A and R are not in the positions we guessed, so they must be in positions 4 and 5? Then we would know the word is of the form: C _ _ A R? or C _ _ R A? etc.

   Alternatively, if we get a check for A in position 2, then we know A is in position 2. Similarly for R in position 3.

   So it's a good test.

   Therefore, I choose ""CARDS"".

   But wait: what if the secret word is ""CARDS""? Then we would win? But we don't know.

   So let's go with ""CARDS"".

   However, note: we are only on the second guess. We have 5 more tries? Actually, 6 tries total, so we have 5 left? Actually, we have used one, so we have 5 left? But the problem says 6 tries, so we have 5 more.

   So we can try.

   Guess: ""CARDS""

   But let me double-check: 
        We are including R and A? Yes.
        We are avoiding E and N? Yes.
        We are starting with C? Yes.
        We are not putting R in position 2? Yes, R is in position 3.
        We are not putting A in position 3? Yes, A is in position 2? Actually, in ""CARDS"", A is in position 2? That's new.

   So it's valid.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""CARDS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N and E are absent (x).

For the next guess:
- The word must start with C (position 1 fixed).
- Must include R and A (confirmed present), but R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3.
- Must exclude N and E (absent).
- To maximize information, test new positions for R and A while introducing common new letters.

""CARDS"" is chosen because:
- Starts with C (✓).
- Tests A in position 2 (new position for A).
- Tests R in position 3 (new position for R).
- Introduces new letters D and S (common consonants).
- Avoids E, N, and previously invalid positions.

<guess>cards</guess>",cards,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(✓), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 1).
 - R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (it must be in one of the other positions: 1,3,4,5? but note position 1 is already C, so R must be in 3,4, or 5).

   - Must not include N or E.

 We can try to form a word that starts with C, and then put R and A in positions that are allowed.

 Let's think of words that start with C and have R and A, and avoid N and E.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 Possible positions for R: 3,4,5
 Possible positions for A: 2,4,5

 But note: we cannot put R in position 2 again (we already tried and it was wrong) and A in position 3 (tried and wrong).

 We can try to put A in position 2? That would be a new position for A. And R in position 4 or 5? Or we can try R in position 3 and A in position 4? etc.

 Let's list some words:

 Option 1: Put A in position 2 and R in position 4? Then we have: C A _ R _
 But we need to fill the 3rd and 5th letters. We cannot use N or E.

 What words? For example: 
   CAR? ... but we need 5 letters.

 Let's try: 
   CARAT? But that has T which is new. Also, note: we have A in position 2 and 5? But we only know one A is in the word? Actually, the word might have two A's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates.

 However, in our first guess we had only one A. So if the secret word has two A's, then we would have known? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we guessed one A and it was present (but in wrong position), there could be another A? But we don't know.

 But to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters.

 However, for now, let's assume we don't know. We can try a word that has A in position 2 and R in position 4.

 Example: ""CARAT"" -> C A R A T? But wait, we have R in position 3? We want to avoid putting R in position 2 (which we did) but we are putting R in position 3? That's allowed because we haven't tried R in position 3 yet.

 However, note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put R in position 3, that might be correct? Or it might be in 4 or 5.

 But we also have to avoid putting A in position 3? In this word ""CARAT"", we have A in position 2 and 4? And we have R in position 3.

 Let's check: 
   Position 1: C (correct)
   Position 2: A -> we don't know if it's correct? We haven't tried A in position 2 before.
   Position 3: R -> we haven't tried R in position 3 before? But in the first guess we had R in position 2 and it was wrong, so R is not in 2, but it could be in 3.

 However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have only one R? We don't know.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess: R was marked as present (but wrong position). So if we put R in position 3 in the second guess and it is correct, then we get a check. If it is still wrong, we get a dash.

 Alternatively, we might try to put R in a completely new position (like 5) and A in a new position (like 4) to test.

 We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think of words that start with C, have R and A, and avoid E and N.

 Some words:
   CARTY? (not a word)
   CARDS? -> but has D and S, and also S is new. But note: we have to avoid E and N? D and S are allowed. However, we have to check if the word is valid.

   CARDS: 
      C A R D S
      Position 1: C (correct)
      Position 2: A (we are testing if A is in position 2? but note: in the secret word, A might be in position 2? or not? We don't know. Also, we have R in position 3? which we haven't tested.

   But wait, the secret word has A, but we don't know if it can be in position 2? It could be. Similarly, R could be in position 3.

   However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have A in position 4 or 5? We don't know.

   Another word: CRAWL? But we have R in position 2 again? We cannot do that because we already know R is not in position 2. So we must avoid putting R in position 2.

   So we cannot use words that have R in the second position.

   Therefore, ""CARDS"" is acceptable because R is in position 3? But wait: in ""CARDS"", the positions are:
        C (1), A (2), R (3), D (4), S (5)

   We are testing:
        A in position 2 (which is new for A) and R in position 3 (which is new for R).

   Also, we are introducing two new letters: D and S.

   But note: the feedback for the first guess said that A is in the word but not in position 3. So if the secret word has A in position 2, then that would be correct? And we would get a check for A in position 2.

   However, if the secret word has A in position 4 or 5, then we would get a dash for A in position 2? and then we would know.

   Similarly, for R: if the secret word has R in position 3, we get a check; if it's in 4 or 5, we get a dash.

   This seems like a good word to test.

   But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? For example, what if the secret word has two A's? Then we might get two A's? But in ""CARDS"", we only have one A. So if the secret word has two A's, we might not get full information? However, we are testing one A at position 2 and we know there's at least one A.

   Alternatively, we could try a word that has A in a different position? For example, put A in position 4? 

   Example: ""CURLY"" -> but that has U and L and Y? and R in position 3? and A is missing? We must include A.

   Another example: ""CHARM"" -> 
        C H A R M
        Here, A is in position 3? But we already know that A is not in position 3 (from the first guess). So we cannot put A in position 3.

   So we must avoid position 3 for A? Yes, because the first guess had A in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? Actually, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, it would be wrong again? But we already know that, so it's a waste. We should try A in a new position: 2,4,5.

   Similarly, for R: avoid position 2.

   Therefore, ""CARDS"" is a valid candidate.

   Another candidate: ""CAMPY""? But that has M and P and Y? and no R? We must include R.

   ""CRWTH""? Not a common word and doesn't have A.

   ""CABIN""? But has B, I, N -> but N is not allowed? We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.

   ""CABIN"" is invalid because of N.

   ""CABLE""? But has E -> not allowed.

   ""CAIRD""? Not a common word.

   ""CARET""? But has E -> not allowed.

   ""CAROB""? -> C A R O B: 
        O and B are new. And it avoids E and N.

   So ""CAROB"" is also a candidate.

   Between ""CARDS"" and ""CAROB"", which one is better? 
        ""CARDS"" has D and S, which are common letters.
        ""CAROB"" has O and B.

   We don't know which letters are more common? But we can choose one.

   Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? But we already have A. The secret word might have other vowels? We don't know.

   Since we are avoiding E, and we have A, the remaining vowels could be I, O, U.

   In ""CAROB"", we have O. In ""CARDS"", we have no vowel (except A). So ""CAROB"" might be better to test a vowel.

   But note: we are only allowed to use words that are valid.

   Let me check: both ""CARDS"" and ""CAROB"" are valid words.

   We can choose ""CAROB"" to test the letter O.

   However, we are also testing R in position 3 and A in position 2.

   Another idea: we know the secret word has C in position 1, and then we have two letters R and A to place. We also have two more letters that are not E or N.

   We might try to put R in position 5 and A in position 4? 

   Example: ""C_ _ A R"" -> what words? 
        ""CIVAR""? not a word.
        ""COLAR""? -> C O L A R: that's a word? Actually, ""collar"" is 6 letters. ""COLAR"" is not common.

   ""CIGAR""? -> but has G and I? and also we have A in position 5? Actually, ""CIGAR"": 
        C I G A R -> A is in position 4? and R in position 5.

   But ""CIGAR"" has I and G? and avoids E and N? and is a valid word.

   So we have multiple options: ""CARDS"", ""CAROB"", ""CIGAR"".

   How to choose? We want to maximize the information.

   In ""CARDS"": 
        We test A in position 2 and R in position 3, and also D and S.
   In ""CAROB"": 
        We test A in position 2 and R in position 3, and also O and B.
   In ""CIGAR"": 
        We test A in position 4 and R in position 5, and also I and G.

   Since we don't have any information about the other two letters, any of these are fine.

   But note: we also want to avoid positions that we know are wrong? Actually, we don't know about the other positions yet.

   However, we know that the secret word does not have E and N, so we are avoiding those.

   I think I'll go with ""CARDS"" because it uses common consonants (D and S).

   But let me think: what if the secret word is ""CRAWL""? But wait, we know that R is not in position 2? So ""CRAWL"" would have R in position 2, which we know is wrong. So it cannot be ""CRAWL"".

   Another possibility: the secret word might be ""CRASS""? 
        But in our first guess, we had ""crane"": 
            C (correct), R (wrong position) -> so R must be in the word but not in position 2. In ""CRASS"", R is in position 2? That would be inconsistent.

   So the secret word must have R in position 3,4, or 5.

   Therefore, ""CRASS"" is not possible.

   Similarly, ""CARTY"" is not a word.

   Let me try to think of the secret word: 
        It starts with C, and has R and A, and two other letters (not E, N). And R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.

   Example: ""CHARM""? But A is in position 3? which we know is wrong? So no.

   ""CLASP"": 
        C L A S P -> A is in position 3? not allowed? So no.

   ""CAMPY"": no R.

   ""CATTY"": no R.

   ""CAROM"": C A R O M -> A in position 2, R in position 3? This is a word? Yes, meaning in billiards.

   So ""CAROM"" is a possibility? But we don't know.

   Therefore, we can try ""CARDS"" to test.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put both A and R in the positions we are testing? But we have to include them.

   Another idea: we can try to put A in position 4 and R in position 3? 

   Example: ""CURAT""? Not a common word.

   Or ""CIRCA"": 
        C I R C A -> but has two C's? and we already know C is in position 1. But the secret word might have two C's? We don't know. Also, we are putting C in position 1 and 4? The feedback for the second C? We don't know.

   However, we are forced to include C in position 1? Actually, we don't have to? But the first letter is fixed as C? Because the feedback said C is correct. So the secret word has C in position 1. So we must start with C.

   But in ""CIRCA"", we have C in position 1 and 4? That's allowed. But we are testing:
        Position 1: C (correct)
        Position 2: I (new)
        Position 3: R (we are testing R in position 3)
        Position 4: C (if the secret word has two C's, then it might be correct? but we don't know if there's a second C)
        Position 5: A (we are testing A in position 5)

   However, we know the secret word has at least one C (in position 1) and one R and one A. It might have more?

   But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about the letters we guessed. We guessed one C and it was correct. So if the secret word has two C's, we wouldn't know until we guess a second C.

   But in ""CIRCA"", we are guessing a second C. That might be useful? But we are also introducing I and using A in position 5.

   However, we are avoiding E and N.

   But ""CIRCA"" is a valid word.

   But note: we are putting R in position 3? and A in position 5? which are new positions.

   This is also a candidate.

   Now, we have several candidates: ""CARDS"", ""CAROB"", ""CIGAR"", ""CIRCA"".

   We need to choose one.

   Let's consider the information we get:

   We want to maximize the chance of getting checks and also cover more letters.

   In ""CIRCA"", we are testing two C's? That might be less likely? But we don't know.

   I think I'll go with ""CARDS"" because it uses common letters and we can get information about A in position 2 and R in position 3.

   So let's choose ""CARDS"".

   But note: we must be cautious. The secret word might have A in position 4? Then in ""CARDS"", we would get:
        C (correct) -> ✓
        A (if the secret word has A in position 4, then A in position 2 is wrong) -> so we get a dash? But wait: if the secret word has only one A and it is in position 4, then we would get:
            Position 2: A -> not present? But wait, the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word. So if we put A in position 2 and the secret word has A in position 4, then we should get a dash for A? Because it's in the word but wrong position.

        Similarly, R in position 3: if the secret word has R in position 4, then we get a dash for R? because it's present but not in position 3.

   So we can get two dashes? That would tell us that both A and R are not in the positions we guessed, so they must be in positions 4 and 5? Then we would know the word is of the form: C _ _ A R? or C _ _ R A? etc.

   Alternatively, if we get a check for A in position 2, then we know A is in position 2. Similarly for R in position 3.

   So it's a good test.

   Therefore, I choose ""CARDS"".

   But wait: what if the secret word is ""CARDS""? Then we would win? But we don't know.

   So let's go with ""CARDS"".

   However, note: we are only on the second guess. We have 5 more tries? Actually, 6 tries total, so we have 5 left? Actually, we have used one, so we have 5 left? But the problem says 6 tries, so we have 5 more.

   So we can try.

   Guess: ""CARDS""

   But let me double-check: 
        We are including R and A? Yes.
        We are avoiding E and N? Yes.
        We are starting with C? Yes.
        We are not putting R in position 2? Yes, R is in position 3.
        We are not putting A in position 3? Yes, A is in position 2? Actually, in ""CARDS"", A is in position 2? That's new.

   So it's valid.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""CARDS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N and E are absent (x).

For the next guess:
- The word must start with C (position 1 fixed).
- Must include R and A (confirmed present), but R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3.
- Must exclude N and E (absent).
- To maximize information, test new positions for R and A while introducing common new letters.

""CARDS"" is chosen because:
- Starts with C (✓).
- Tests A in position 2 (new position for A).
- Tests R in position 3 (new position for R).
- Introduces new letters D and S (common consonants).
- Avoids E, N, and previously invalid positions.",Guess 2: cards -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) S(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word often uses common letters and has a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 3 consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E) which are common.
   - It has unique letters to avoid duplication.

 So, our first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(✓), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 1).
 - R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (it must be in one of the other positions: 1,3,4,5? but note position 1 is already C, so R must be in 3,4, or 5).
 - A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 4 or 5, since position 1 is C and position 2 is not A because it's marked as wrong position? Actually, note: the feedback for R is '-' meaning it's in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3).
 - N and E are not in the word at all.

 So, we know:
   Position 1: C (fixed)
   The word contains: C, R, A (and two more letters, since N and E are absent)
   The word does not contain: N, E.

 Also, note that R and A are present but not in the positions we guessed (2 and 3 respectively). Therefore:
   R must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But wait, position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. So positions available for R: 3,4,5.
   Similarly, A must be in position 2,4,5? But note: we guessed A in position 3 and it was wrong, so A cannot be in position 3. Also, position 1 is C, so A cannot be there. Therefore, A must be in position 2,4, or 5.

 However, we must also consider that the word has 5 letters and we have three known letters: C, R, A.

 We have two more letters to discover, and they are not N or E.

 Now, for the next guess, we want to try to place R and A in different positions and also try to find the remaining letters.

 Constraints for the next guess:
   - Must be a 5-letter English word.
   - Must start with C (because position 1 is fixed as C and correct).
   - Must include R and A (because they are in the secret word) but in positions different from the first guess for the ones that were marked wrong (so R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3).
   - Must not include N or E.

 We can try to form a word that starts with C, and then put R and A in positions that are allowed.

 Let's think of words that start with C and have R and A, and avoid N and E.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 Possible positions for R: 3,4,5
 Possible positions for A: 2,4,5

 But note: we cannot put R in position 2 again (we already tried and it was wrong) and A in position 3 (tried and wrong).

 We can try to put A in position 2? That would be a new position for A. And R in position 4 or 5? Or we can try R in position 3 and A in position 4? etc.

 Let's list some words:

 Option 1: Put A in position 2 and R in position 4? Then we have: C A _ R _
 But we need to fill the 3rd and 5th letters. We cannot use N or E.

 What words? For example: 
   CAR? ... but we need 5 letters.

 Let's try: 
   CARAT? But that has T which is new. Also, note: we have A in position 2 and 5? But we only know one A is in the word? Actually, the word might have two A's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates.

 However, in our first guess we had only one A. So if the secret word has two A's, then we would have known? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we guessed one A and it was present (but in wrong position), there could be another A? But we don't know.

 But to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters.

 However, for now, let's assume we don't know. We can try a word that has A in position 2 and R in position 4.

 Example: ""CARAT"" -> C A R A T? But wait, we have R in position 3? We want to avoid putting R in position 2 (which we did) but we are putting R in position 3? That's allowed because we haven't tried R in position 3 yet.

 However, note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put R in position 3, that might be correct? Or it might be in 4 or 5.

 But we also have to avoid putting A in position 3? In this word ""CARAT"", we have A in position 2 and 4? And we have R in position 3.

 Let's check: 
   Position 1: C (correct)
   Position 2: A -> we don't know if it's correct? We haven't tried A in position 2 before.
   Position 3: R -> we haven't tried R in position 3 before? But in the first guess we had R in position 2 and it was wrong, so R is not in 2, but it could be in 3.

 However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have only one R? We don't know.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess: R was marked as present (but wrong position). So if we put R in position 3 in the second guess and it is correct, then we get a check. If it is still wrong, we get a dash.

 Alternatively, we might try to put R in a completely new position (like 5) and A in a new position (like 4) to test.

 We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think of words that start with C, have R and A, and avoid E and N.

 Some words:
   CARTY? (not a word)
   CARDS? -> but has D and S, and also S is new. But note: we have to avoid E and N? D and S are allowed. However, we have to check if the word is valid.

   CARDS: 
      C A R D S
      Position 1: C (correct)
      Position 2: A (we are testing if A is in position 2? but note: in the secret word, A might be in position 2? or not? We don't know. Also, we have R in position 3? which we haven't tested.

   But wait, the secret word has A, but we don't know if it can be in position 2? It could be. Similarly, R could be in position 3.

   However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have A in position 4 or 5? We don't know.

   Another word: CRAWL? But we have R in position 2 again? We cannot do that because we already know R is not in position 2. So we must avoid putting R in position 2.

   So we cannot use words that have R in the second position.

   Therefore, ""CARDS"" is acceptable because R is in position 3? But wait: in ""CARDS"", the positions are:
        C (1), A (2), R (3), D (4), S (5)

   We are testing:
        A in position 2 (which is new for A) and R in position 3 (which is new for R).

   Also, we are introducing two new letters: D and S.

   But note: the feedback for the first guess said that A is in the word but not in position 3. So if the secret word has A in position 2, then that would be correct? And we would get a check for A in position 2.

   However, if the secret word has A in position 4 or 5, then we would get a dash for A in position 2? and then we would know.

   Similarly, for R: if the secret word has R in position 3, we get a check; if it's in 4 or 5, we get a dash.

   This seems like a good word to test.

   But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? For example, what if the secret word has two A's? Then we might get two A's? But in ""CARDS"", we only have one A. So if the secret word has two A's, we might not get full information? However, we are testing one A at position 2 and we know there's at least one A.

   Alternatively, we could try a word that has A in a different position? For example, put A in position 4? 

   Example: ""CURLY"" -> but that has U and L and Y? and R in position 3? and A is missing? We must include A.

   Another example: ""CHARM"" -> 
        C H A R M
        Here, A is in position 3? But we already know that A is not in position 3 (from the first guess). So we cannot put A in position 3.

   So we must avoid position 3 for A? Yes, because the first guess had A in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? Actually, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, it would be wrong again? But we already know that, so it's a waste. We should try A in a new position: 2,4,5.

   Similarly, for R: avoid position 2.

   Therefore, ""CARDS"" is a valid candidate.

   Another candidate: ""CAMPY""? But that has M and P and Y? and no R? We must include R.

   ""CRWTH""? Not a common word and doesn't have A.

   ""CABIN""? But has B, I, N -> but N is not allowed? We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.

   ""CABIN"" is invalid because of N.

   ""CABLE""? But has E -> not allowed.

   ""CAIRD""? Not a common word.

   ""CARET""? But has E -> not allowed.

   ""CAROB""? -> C A R O B: 
        O and B are new. And it avoids E and N.

   So ""CAROB"" is also a candidate.

   Between ""CARDS"" and ""CAROB"", which one is better? 
        ""CARDS"" has D and S, which are common letters.
        ""CAROB"" has O and B.

   We don't know which letters are more common? But we can choose one.

   Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? But we already have A. The secret word might have other vowels? We don't know.

   Since we are avoiding E, and we have A, the remaining vowels could be I, O, U.

   In ""CAROB"", we have O. In ""CARDS"", we have no vowel (except A). So ""CAROB"" might be better to test a vowel.

   But note: we are only allowed to use words that are valid.

   Let me check: both ""CARDS"" and ""CAROB"" are valid words.

   We can choose ""CAROB"" to test the letter O.

   However, we are also testing R in position 3 and A in position 2.

   Another idea: we know the secret word has C in position 1, and then we have two letters R and A to place. We also have two more letters that are not E or N.

   We might try to put R in position 5 and A in position 4? 

   Example: ""C_ _ A R"" -> what words? 
        ""CIVAR""? not a word.
        ""COLAR""? -> C O L A R: that's a word? Actually, ""collar"" is 6 letters. ""COLAR"" is not common.

   ""CIGAR""? -> but has G and I? and also we have A in position 5? Actually, ""CIGAR"": 
        C I G A R -> A is in position 4? and R in position 5.

   But ""CIGAR"" has I and G? and avoids E and N? and is a valid word.

   So we have multiple options: ""CARDS"", ""CAROB"", ""CIGAR"".

   How to choose? We want to maximize the information.

   In ""CARDS"": 
        We test A in position 2 and R in position 3, and also D and S.
   In ""CAROB"": 
        We test A in position 2 and R in position 3, and also O and B.
   In ""CIGAR"": 
        We test A in position 4 and R in position 5, and also I and G.

   Since we don't have any information about the other two letters, any of these are fine.

   But note: we also want to avoid positions that we know are wrong? Actually, we don't know about the other positions yet.

   However, we know that the secret word does not have E and N, so we are avoiding those.

   I think I'll go with ""CARDS"" because it uses common consonants (D and S).

   But let me think: what if the secret word is ""CRAWL""? But wait, we know that R is not in position 2? So ""CRAWL"" would have R in position 2, which we know is wrong. So it cannot be ""CRAWL"".

   Another possibility: the secret word might be ""CRASS""? 
        But in our first guess, we had ""crane"": 
            C (correct), R (wrong position) -> so R must be in the word but not in position 2. In ""CRASS"", R is in position 2? That would be inconsistent.

   So the secret word must have R in position 3,4, or 5.

   Therefore, ""CRASS"" is not possible.

   Similarly, ""CARTY"" is not a word.

   Let me try to think of the secret word: 
        It starts with C, and has R and A, and two other letters (not E, N). And R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.

   Example: ""CHARM""? But A is in position 3? which we know is wrong? So no.

   ""CLASP"": 
        C L A S P -> A is in position 3? not allowed? So no.

   ""CAMPY"": no R.

   ""CATTY"": no R.

   ""CAROM"": C A R O M -> A in position 2, R in position 3? This is a word? Yes, meaning in billiards.

   So ""CAROM"" is a possibility? But we don't know.

   Therefore, we can try ""CARDS"" to test.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put both A and R in the positions we are testing? But we have to include them.

   Another idea: we can try to put A in position 4 and R in position 3? 

   Example: ""CURAT""? Not a common word.

   Or ""CIRCA"": 
        C I R C A -> but has two C's? and we already know C is in position 1. But the secret word might have two C's? We don't know. Also, we are putting C in position 1 and 4? The feedback for the second C? We don't know.

   However, we are forced to include C in position 1? Actually, we don't have to? But the first letter is fixed as C? Because the feedback said C is correct. So the secret word has C in position 1. So we must start with C.

   But in ""CIRCA"", we have C in position 1 and 4? That's allowed. But we are testing:
        Position 1: C (correct)
        Position 2: I (new)
        Position 3: R (we are testing R in position 3)
        Position 4: C (if the secret word has two C's, then it might be correct? but we don't know if there's a second C)
        Position 5: A (we are testing A in position 5)

   However, we know the secret word has at least one C (in position 1) and one R and one A. It might have more?

   But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about the letters we guessed. We guessed one C and it was correct. So if the secret word has two C's, we wouldn't know until we guess a second C.

   But in ""CIRCA"", we are guessing a second C. That might be useful? But we are also introducing I and using A in position 5.

   However, we are avoiding E and N.

   But ""CIRCA"" is a valid word.

   But note: we are putting R in position 3? and A in position 5? which are new positions.

   This is also a candidate.

   Now, we have several candidates: ""CARDS"", ""CAROB"", ""CIGAR"", ""CIRCA"".

   We need to choose one.

   Let's consider the information we get:

   We want to maximize the chance of getting checks and also cover more letters.

   In ""CIRCA"", we are testing two C's? That might be less likely? But we don't know.

   I think I'll go with ""CARDS"" because it uses common letters and we can get information about A in position 2 and R in position 3.

   So let's choose ""CARDS"".

   But note: we must be cautious. The secret word might have A in position 4? Then in ""CARDS"", we would get:
        C (correct) -> ✓
        A (if the secret word has A in position 4, then A in position 2 is wrong) -> so we get a dash? But wait: if the secret word has only one A and it is in position 4, then we would get:
            Position 2: A -> not present? But wait, the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word. So if we put A in position 2 and the secret word has A in position 4, then we should get a dash for A? Because it's in the word but wrong position.

        Similarly, R in position 3: if the secret word has R in position 4, then we get a dash for R? because it's present but not in position 3.

   So we can get two dashes? That would tell us that both A and R are not in the positions we guessed, so they must be in positions 4 and 5? Then we would know the word is of the form: C _ _ A R? or C _ _ R A? etc.

   Alternatively, if we get a check for A in position 2, then we know A is in position 2. Similarly for R in position 3.

   So it's a good test.

   Therefore, I choose ""CARDS"".

   But wait: what if the secret word is ""CARDS""? Then we would win? But we don't know.

   So let's go with ""CARDS"".

   However, note: we are only on the second guess. We have 5 more tries? Actually, 6 tries total, so we have 5 left? Actually, we have used one, so we have 5 left? But the problem says 6 tries, so we have 5 more.

   So we can try.

   Guess: ""CARDS""

   But let me double-check: 
        We are including R and A? Yes.
        We are avoiding E and N? Yes.
        We are starting with C? Yes.
        We are not putting R in position 2? Yes, R is in position 3.
        We are not putting A in position 3? Yes, A is in position 2? Actually, in ""CARDS"", A is in position 2? That's new.

   So it's valid.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""CARDS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N and E are absent (x).

For the next guess:
- The word must start with C (position 1 fixed).
- Must include R and A (confirmed present), but R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3.
- Must exclude N and E (absent).
- To maximize information, test new positions for R and A while introducing common new letters.

""CARDS"" is chosen because:
- Starts with C (✓).
- Tests A in position 2 (new position for A).
- Tests R in position 3 (new position for R).
- Introduces new letters D and S (common consonants).
- Avoids E, N, and previously invalid positions.

Actually, note: the feedback for R is \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3).\n - N and E are not in the word at all.\n\n So, we know:\n   Position 1: C (fixed)\n   The word contains: C, R, A (and two more letters, since N and E are absent)\n   The word does not contain: N, E.\n\n Also, note that R and A are present but not in the positions we guessed (2 and 3 respectively).

That would be a new position for A. And R in position 4 or 5? Or we can try R in position 3 and A in position 4? etc.\n\n Let\'s list some words:\n\n Option 1: Put A in position 2 and R in position 4? Then we have: C A _ R _\n But we need to fill the 3rd and 5th letters. We cannot use N or E.\n\n What words? For example: \n   CAR? ... but we need 5 letters.\n\n Let\'s try: \n   CARAT? But that has T which is new. Also, note: we have A in position 2 and 5? But we only know one A is in the word? Actually, the word might have two A\'s? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates.\n\n However, in our first guess we had only one A. So if the secret word has two A\'s, then we would have known? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we guessed one A and it was present (but in wrong position), there could be another A? But we don\'t know.\n\n But to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters.\n\n However, for now, let\'s assume we don\'t know. We can try a word that has A in position 2 and R in position 4.\n\n Example: ""CARAT"" -> C A R A T? But wait, we have R in position 3? We want to avoid putting R in position 2 (which we did) but we are putting R in position 3? That\'s allowed because we haven\'t tried R in position 3 yet.\n\n However, note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put R in position 3, that might be correct? Or it might be in 4 or 5.\n\n But we also have to avoid putting A in position 3? In this word ""CARAT"", we have A in position 2 and 4? And we have R in position 3.\n\n Let\'s check: \n   Position 1: C (correct)\n   Position 2: A -> we don\'t know if it\'s correct? We haven\'t tried A in position 2 before.\n   Position 3: R -> we haven\'t tried R in position 3 before? But in the first guess we had R in position 2 and it was wrong, so R is not in 2, but it could be in 3.\n\n However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have only one R? We don\'t know.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess: R was marked as present (but wrong position). So if we put R in position 3 in the second guess and it is correct, then we get a check. If it is still wrong, we get a dash.\n\n Alternatively, we might try to put R in a completely new position (like 5) and A in a new position (like 4) to test.\n\n We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me think of words that start with C, have R and A, and avoid E and N.\n\n Some words:\n   CARTY? (not a word)\n   CARDS? -> but has D and S, and also S is new. But note: we have to avoid E and N? D and S are allowed. However, we have to check if the word is valid.\n\n   CARDS: \n      C A R D S\n      Position 1: C (correct)\n      Position 2: A (we are testing if A is in position 2? but note: in the secret word, A might be in position 2? or not? We don\'t know. Also, we have R in position 3? which we haven\'t tested.\n\n   But wait, the secret word has A, but we don\'t know if it can be in position 2? It could be. Similarly, R could be in position 3.\n\n   However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have A in position 4 or 5? We don\'t know.\n\n   Another word: CRAWL? But we have R in position 2 again? We cannot do that because we already know R is not in position 2. So we must avoid putting R in position 2.\n\n   So we cannot use words that have R in the second position.\n\n   Therefore, ""CARDS"" is acceptable because R is in position 3? But wait: in ""CARDS"", the positions are:\n        C (1), A (2), R (3), D (4), S (5)\n\n   We are testing:\n        A in position 2 (which is new for A) and R in position 3 (which is new for R).\n\n   Also, we are introducing two new letters: D and S.\n\n   But note: the feedback for the first guess said that A is in the word but not in position 3. So if the secret word has A in position 2, then that would be correct? And we would get a check for A in position 2.\n\n   However, if the secret word has A in position 4 or 5, then we would get a dash for A in position 2? and then we would know.\n\n   Similarly, for R: if the secret word has R in position 3, we get a check; if it\'s in 4 or 5, we get a dash.\n\n   This seems like a good word to test.\n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? For example, what if the secret word has two A\'s? Then we might get two A\'s? But in ""CARDS"", we only have one A. So if the secret word has two A\'s, we might not get full information? However, we are testing one A at position 2 and we know there\'s at least one A.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try a word that has A in a different position? For example, put A in position 4? \n\n   Example: ""CURLY"" -> but that has U and L and Y? and R in position 3? and A is missing? We must include A.\n\n   Another example: ""CHARM"" -> \n        C H A R M\n        Here, A is in position 3? But we already know that A is not in position 3 (from the first guess). So we cannot put A in position 3.\n\n   So we must avoid position 3 for A? Yes, because the first guess had A in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? Actually, no: the feedback for A was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, it would be wrong again? But we already know that, so it\'s a waste. We should try A in a new position: 2,4,5.\n\n   Similarly, for R: avoid position 2.\n\n   Therefore, ""CARDS"" is a valid candidate.\n\n   Another candidate: ""CAMPY""? But that has M and P and Y? and no R? We must include R.\n\n   ""CRWTH""? Not a common word and doesn\'t have A.\n\n   ""CABIN""? But has B, I, N -> but N is not allowed? We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.\n\n   ""CABIN"" is invalid because of N.\n\n   ""CABLE""? But has E -> not allowed.\n\n   ""CAIRD""? Not a common word.\n\n   ""CARET""? But has E -> not allowed.\n\n   ""CAROB""? -> C A R O B: \n        O and B are new. And it avoids E and N.\n\n   So ""CAROB"" is also a candidate.\n\n   Between ""CARDS"" and ""CAROB"", which one is better? \n        ""CARDS"" has D and S, which are common letters.\n        ""CAROB"" has O and B.\n\n   We don\'t know which letters are more common? But we can choose one.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? But we already have A. The secret word might have other vowels? We don\'t know.\n\n   Since we are avoiding E, and we have A, the remaining vowels could be I, O, U.\n\n   In ""CAROB"", we have O. In ""CARDS"", we have no vowel (except A). So ""CAROB"" might be better to test a vowel.\n\n   But note: we are only allowed to use words that are valid.\n\n   Let me check: both ""CARDS"" and ""CAROB"" are valid words.\n\n   We can choose ""CAROB"" to test the letter O.\n\n   However, we are also testing R in position 3 and A in position 2.\n\n   Another idea: we know the secret word has C in position 1, and then we have two letters R and A to place. We also have two more letters that are not E or N.\n\n   We might try to put R in position 5 and A in position 4? \n\n   Example: ""C_ _ A R"" -> what words? \n        ""CIVAR""? not a word.\n        ""COLAR""? -> C O L A R: that\'s a word? Actually, ""collar"" is 6 letters. ""COLAR"" is not common.\n\n   ""CIGAR""? -> but has G and I? and also we have A in position 5? Actually, ""CIGAR"": \n        C I G A R -> A is in position 4? and R in position 5.\n\n   But ""CIGAR"" has I and G? and avoids E and N? and is a valid word.\n\n   So we have multiple options: ""CARDS"", ""CAROB"", ""CIGAR"".\n\n   How to choose? We want to maximize the information.\n\n   In ""CARDS"": \n        We test A in position 2 and R in position 3, and also D and S.\n   In ""CAROB"": \n        We test A in position 2 and R in position 3, and also O and B.\n   In ""CIGAR"": \n        We test A in position 4 and R in position 5, and also I and G.\n\n   Since we don\'t have any information about the other two letters, any of these are fine.\n\n   But note: we also want to avoid positions that we know are wrong?

But wait, we know that R is not in position 2? So ""CRAWL"" would have R in position 2, which we know is wrong. So it cannot be ""CRAWL"".\n\n   Another possibility: the secret word might be ""CRASS""? \n        But in our first guess, we had ""crane"": \n            C (correct), R (wrong position) -> so R must be in the word but not in position 2. In ""CRASS"", R is in position 2? That would be inconsistent.\n\n   So the secret word must have R in position 3,4, or 5.\n\n   Therefore, ""CRASS"" is not possible.\n\n   Similarly, ""CARTY"" is not a word.\n\n   Let me try to think of the secret word: \n        It starts with C, and has R and A, and two other letters (not E, N). And R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.\n\n   Example: ""CHARM""? But A is in position 3? which we know is wrong? So no.\n\n   ""CLASP"": \n        C L A S P -> A is in position 3? not allowed? So no.\n\n   ""CAMPY"": no R.\n\n   ""CATTY"": no R.\n\n   ""CAROM"": C A R O M -> A in position 2, R in position 3?

Then in ""CARDS"", we would get:\n        C (correct) -> ✓\n        A (if the secret word has A in position 4, then A in position 2 is wrong) -> so we get a dash? But wait: if the secret word has only one A and it is in position 4, then we would get:\n            Position 2: A -> not present? But wait, the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word. So if we put A in position 2 and the secret word has A in position 4, then we should get a dash for A? Because it\'s in the word but wrong position.\n\n        Similarly, R in position 3: if the secret word has R in position 4, then we get a dash for R? because it\'s present but not in position 3.\n\n   So we can get two dashes? That would tell us that both A and R are not in the positions we guessed, so they must be in positions 4 and 5? Then we would know the word is of the form: C _ _ A R? or C _ _ R A? etc.\n\n   Alternatively, if we get a check for A in position 2, then we know A is in position 2. Similarly for R in position 3.\n\n   So it\'s a good test.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""CARDS"".\n\n   But wait: what if the secret word is ""CARDS""? Then we would win? But we don\'t know.\n\n   So let\'s go with ""CARDS"".\n\n   However, note: we are only on the second guess. We have 5 more tries? Actually, 6 tries total, so we have 5 left? Actually, we have used one, so we have 5 left? But the problem says 6 tries, so we have 5 more.\n\n   So we can try.\n\n   Guess: ""CARDS""\n\n   But let me double-check: \n        We are including R and A? Yes.\n        We are avoiding E and N? Yes.\n        We are starting with C? Yes.\n        We are not putting R in position 2? Yes, R is in position 3.\n        We are not putting A in position 3? Yes, A is in position 2? Actually, in ""CARDS"", A is in position 2? That\'s new.\n\n   So it\'s valid.\n\n   Therefore, the next guess is ""CARDS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).\n- N and E are absent (x).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must start with C (position 1 fixed).\n- Must include R and A (confirmed present), but R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3.\n- Must exclude N and E (absent).\n- To maximize information, test new positions for R and A while introducing common new letters.\n\n""CARDS"" is chosen because:\n- Starts with C (✓).\n- Tests A in position 2 (new position for A).\n- Tests R in position 3 (new position for R).\n- Introduces new letters D and S (common consonants).\n- Avoids E, N, and previously invalid positions.\n\n<guess>cards</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: cards -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- R: - (in word, wrong position; so not position 2)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; so not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""cards""
- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- A: ✓ (correct position, position 2)
- R: ✓ (correct position, position 3)
- D: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)

Now, we know:
- The secret word starts with ""CAR"" (positions 1,2,3 are C, A, R respectively).
- The secret word does not contain: N, E, D, S.
- The remaining two letters (positions 4 and 5) are unknown, but must be letters that are not N, E, D, S.

We also know from the first guess that A was not in position 3, but now we have it in position 2 and it's correct. Similarly, R was not in position 2 but is correct in position 3.

Now, we need to find a word that starts with ""CAR"" and has two more letters that are not N, E, D, S.

We have two positions left: 4 and 5.

We must avoid the letters: N, E, D, S.

We also know that the secret word has exactly 5 letters, so we are looking for words of the form ""CAR??"" where the two ? are letters not in {N, E, D, S}.

We can think of common English words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:
- CAR??
  - CARAT: but T is allowed? Yes, but we have to check if T is excluded? We don't have information about T. However, in the first guess, we didn't have T, so it could be. But note: CARAT has A at the end? But we already have A in position 2, and the secret word might have two A's? We don't know. Also, we have to avoid D and S? CARAT has T, which is not excluded. But wait, in the second guess, we have D and S excluded, but T is not excluded. So CARAT is a candidate? But let's see: CARAT has two A's? The secret word might have two A's? We don't know. But we can try.

  However, we are on the third guess and we know the first three letters. We can try to guess the entire word.

  But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters: N, E, D, S.

  Let's list some common words starting with ""CAR"" that don't have N, E, D, S:

  - CARAT: C A R A T -> positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:A, 5:T -> but we have A in position 4? We don't know if that's allowed? The secret word might have two A's? Also, we haven't excluded T.

  - CAROB: but we excluded D and S? CAROB has O and B, which are not excluded. But in the second guess, we had D and S excluded, but O and B are new. However, we know the word must be 5 letters and start with CAR. CAROB: C A R O B -> but we have O and B. Is that a word? Yes.

  - CAROL: but has O and L? But L is not excluded. However, we have to avoid E, N, D, S. L is allowed. But CAROL has O and L? But wait, CAROL: C A R O L -> that's a word. But note: we have O and L.

  - CAROM: C A R O M -> M is allowed.

  - CARPY: C A R P Y -> P and Y allowed.

  - CART: too short.

  - CARVE: but E is excluded -> not allowed.

  - CARBS: but S is excluded -> not allowed.

  - CARD: too short.

  - CARTS: S excluded.

  - CARED: E and D excluded.

  So possible words: CARAT, CAROB, CAROL, CAROM, CARPY, etc.

  But we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? For example, CARAT has two A's.

  How can we confirm? We can try one of these.

  Since we have two positions to guess, and we have limited information, we can choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet to get more information? But we already know the first three letters are fixed. So we are only guessing the last two.

  However, we don't know the last two, so we need to test possibilities.

  But note: we have only two positions, so we can try a word that covers multiple possibilities? But we are forced to put specific letters.

  Actually, we are going to guess a full word that starts with ""CAR"" and then two letters that are not excluded.

  We can try ""CAROL"" because it uses O and L, which are common.

  But let me see: if we guess ""CAROL"", then:
      Position 4: O -> if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we get a dash or x? But we don't know if O is in the word.
      Similarly, position 5: L.

  But we are not sure.

  Alternatively, we can try ""CARAT"" to test if there is a T and a second A.

  However, we already know that A is in the word (from first guess) and we have it in position 2. But if we put A in position 4, and if the secret word has two A's, then we get a check? Or if not, we get a dash? But we know A is in the word, so if we put A in position 4 and it's not there, we get a dash meaning it's in the word but wrong position? But we already have A in position 2 which is correct, so the dash would indicate that there is another A? Actually, no: the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong position is a dash, and if it's in the word and in the correct position, it's a check.

  But if the secret word has only one A, and we put A in position 4, then we would get a dash? Because the A is in the word but not in position 4? But wait, the A is already in position 2, so if we put an extra A in position 4 and the secret word has only one A, then the feedback for the second A might be an 'x'? Because there is no second A.

  The feedback in Wordle: if you guess a letter that appears more times than in the secret word, the extra ones are marked as absent (x). So if the secret word has only one A, and we guess two A's, then one of them (the one in the wrong position) will be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback is given per position. The first A (position 2) is correct, so it gets a check. The second A (position 4) would be marked as absent (x) because there is no second A.

  So if we guess ""CARAT"" and the secret word is ""CAROL"", then:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓ (position 2)
      R: ✓
      A: x (because no second A)
      T: x (if T is not in the word)

  That would tell us that there is no second A and no T.

  But if the secret word is ""CARAT"", then we get all correct.

  So we can try ""CARAT"".

  But we have other possibilities.

  Since we have limited time, and we know the first three letters, we can try to think of the most common words.

  Common 5-letter words starting with ""CAR"":
    CARET (but E excluded)
    CARES (E and S excluded)
    CAROL
    CARGO (G and O? but G is not excluded? and O? and we have to avoid E, N, D, S. G and O are allowed. But CARGO: C A R G O -> that's a word. But we haven't excluded G or O.

  So CARGO is also a candidate.

  We have many: CARAT, CAROB, CAROL, CAROM, CARGO, CARPI, CARPS, CARVY, etc.

  How to choose? We can choose one that uses common letters to get information.

  Alternatively, we can choose one that we think is most likely.

  But note: we have already excluded D, S, E, N. The remaining letters are more likely to be vowels or common consonants.

  We haven't tried: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  We can try to include a vowel in position 4? Because many words have vowels in the middle.

  For example, O is a common vowel.

  So words like CAROL, CARGO, CAROM have O.

  Or CARAT has A (which we already know) and T.

  Let me check the frequency: in English, after ""CAR"", common continuations are with a vowel? Like O, I, E (but E is excluded) or a consonant.

  Since E is excluded, O is a good candidate.

  So I'll go with ""CAROL"".

  But let's see: if we guess ""CAROL"", and the secret word is ""CARGO"", then we get:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      R: ✓
      O: ? -> if the secret word has O in position 4, then ✓; if not, then if O is in the word but wrong position, we get dash; if not in word, x.
      L: similarly.

  But we don't know.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has two new letters that are very common to maximize the chance of hitting.

  But we are only guessing two letters.

  I think we should try ""CAROL"" because it is a common word.

  But wait, the feedback from the second guess: we had ""CARDS"" and we got C,A,R correct and D,S absent. So the secret word is ""CAR??"" and the two letters are not D or S, and not E or N.

  Another common word is ""CARGO"". 

  Let me see: CARGO is more common than CAROL? Not sure.

  We can also consider ""CARAT"" if we think there might be a T.

  But to make a decision, I'll choose ""CARGO"" because it has two common letters: G and O.

  However, we don't have information about G and O.

  But note: we are on the third guess, and we have three more guesses after this? Actually, we have 6 total, we used 2, so 4 left? But we can try.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat any of the excluded letters and uses new ones.

  I think I'll go with ""CARGO"".

  But let me confirm: ""CARGO"" is C A R G O.

  We haven't excluded G or O.

  So:

  <guess>cargo</guess>

  But wait, what if the secret word is ""CAROL""? Then we get:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      R: ✓
      G: x (if not in word)
      O: - (if O is in the word but not in position 4? because in ""CAROL"", O is in position 4? Actually, in ""CAROL"", O is in position 4? 
          C A R O L -> O is position 4, L is position 5.

      So if we guess ""CARGO"" and the secret word is ""CAROL"", then:
          Position 4: G -> not in word? so x
          Position 5: O -> in the word? but in position 4, not 5? so dash? 

      But wait, the secret word ""CAROL"" has O in position 4, so if we put O in position 5, it should be marked as dash (present but wrong position) because there is an O in the word but not in position 5.

      Then we would know that O is in the word but not in position 5, and since we know the first three, we can deduce that O must be in position 4? because position 1,2,3 are fixed. Then we can try ""CAROL"" next.

  Similarly, if we guess ""CARGO"" and the secret word is ""CARGO"", we win.

  If the secret word is ""CARAT"", then:
      Position 4: G -> x
      Position 5: O -> x
      Then we know that the last two letters are not G and O, and we can try another word.

  So ""CARGO"" is a good test.

  But we have many possibilities. We might not get it in one guess.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has as many new letters as possible? But we are only guessing two new letters.

  I think ""CARGO"" is a reasonable choice.

  But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters? 

  Another idea: we can try ""CARLY""? But Y is allowed? and L. But ""CARLY"" is a name? Not sure if it's accepted. Usually, Wordle uses common words.

  ""CARET"" is out because of E.

  ""CARTY"" not a word.

  ""CARVY"" not common.

  So I'll go with ""CARGO"".

  Therefore, the next guess is ""CARGO"".
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- The first three letters are confirmed as C, A, R in positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively (from ""crane"" and ""cards"").
- D and S are absent (from ""cards""), in addition to previously excluded N and E (from ""crane"").
- The secret word is of the form ""CAR??"", where the last two letters are not D, S, N, or E.

Possible words include CARGO, CAROL, CAROB, CARAT, CAROM, etc. ""CARGO"" is chosen because:
- It tests common letters (G and O) not yet tried.
- It avoids excluded letters (D, S, N, E).
- It efficiently narrows down possibilities for positions 4 and 5.

<guess>cargo</guess>",cargo,"We have feedback from two guesses:

  Therefore, the next guess is ""CARGO"".Based on the feedback:
- The first three letters are confirmed as C, A, R in positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively (from ""crane"" and ""cards"").
- D and S are absent (from ""cards""), in addition to previously excluded N and E (from ""crane"").
- The secret word is of the form ""CAR??"", where the last two letters are not D, S, N, or E.

Possible words include CARGO, CAROL, CAROB, CARAT, CAROM, etc. ""CARGO"" is chosen because:
- It tests common letters (G and O) not yet tried.
- It avoids excluded letters (D, S, N, E).
- It efficiently narrows down possibilities for positions 4 and 5.",Guess 3: cargo -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) G(x) O(-),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word often uses common letters and has a balanced set of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include: CRANE, SLATE, TRACE, etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 3 consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E) which are common.
   - It has unique letters to avoid duplication.

 So, our first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(✓), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - C is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 1).
 - R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (it must be in one of the other positions: 1,3,4,5? but note position 1 is already C, so R must be in 3,4, or 5).
 - A is in the secret word but not in position 3 (so it must be in position 4 or 5, since position 1 is C and position 2 is not A because it's marked as wrong position? Actually, note: the feedback for R is '-' meaning it's in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3).
 - N and E are not in the word at all.

 So, we know:
   Position 1: C (fixed)
   The word contains: C, R, A (and two more letters, since N and E are absent)
   The word does not contain: N, E.

 Also, note that R and A are present but not in the positions we guessed (2 and 3 respectively). Therefore:
   R must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But wait, position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. So positions available for R: 3,4,5.
   Similarly, A must be in position 2,4,5? But note: we guessed A in position 3 and it was wrong, so A cannot be in position 3. Also, position 1 is C, so A cannot be there. Therefore, A must be in position 2,4, or 5.

 However, we must also consider that the word has 5 letters and we have three known letters: C, R, A.

 We have two more letters to discover, and they are not N or E.

 Now, for the next guess, we want to try to place R and A in different positions and also try to find the remaining letters.

 Constraints for the next guess:
   - Must be a 5-letter English word.
   - Must start with C (because position 1 is fixed as C and correct).
   - Must include R and A (because they are in the secret word) but in positions different from the first guess for the ones that were marked wrong (so R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3).
   - Must not include N or E.

 We can try to form a word that starts with C, and then put R and A in positions that are allowed.

 Let's think of words that start with C and have R and A, and avoid N and E.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 Possible positions for R: 3,4,5
 Possible positions for A: 2,4,5

 But note: we cannot put R in position 2 again (we already tried and it was wrong) and A in position 3 (tried and wrong).

 We can try to put A in position 2? That would be a new position for A. And R in position 4 or 5? Or we can try R in position 3 and A in position 4? etc.

 Let's list some words:

 Option 1: Put A in position 2 and R in position 4? Then we have: C A _ R _
 But we need to fill the 3rd and 5th letters. We cannot use N or E.

 What words? For example: 
   CAR? ... but we need 5 letters.

 Let's try: 
   CARAT? But that has T which is new. Also, note: we have A in position 2 and 5? But we only know one A is in the word? Actually, the word might have two A's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates.

 However, in our first guess we had only one A. So if the secret word has two A's, then we would have known? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we guessed one A and it was present (but in wrong position), there could be another A? But we don't know.

 But to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters.

 However, for now, let's assume we don't know. We can try a word that has A in position 2 and R in position 4.

 Example: ""CARAT"" -> C A R A T? But wait, we have R in position 3? We want to avoid putting R in position 2 (which we did) but we are putting R in position 3? That's allowed because we haven't tried R in position 3 yet.

 However, note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put R in position 3, that might be correct? Or it might be in 4 or 5.

 But we also have to avoid putting A in position 3? In this word ""CARAT"", we have A in position 2 and 4? And we have R in position 3.

 Let's check: 
   Position 1: C (correct)
   Position 2: A -> we don't know if it's correct? We haven't tried A in position 2 before.
   Position 3: R -> we haven't tried R in position 3 before? But in the first guess we had R in position 2 and it was wrong, so R is not in 2, but it could be in 3.

 However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have only one R? We don't know.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess: R was marked as present (but wrong position). So if we put R in position 3 in the second guess and it is correct, then we get a check. If it is still wrong, we get a dash.

 Alternatively, we might try to put R in a completely new position (like 5) and A in a new position (like 4) to test.

 We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think of words that start with C, have R and A, and avoid E and N.

 Some words:
   CARTY? (not a word)
   CARDS? -> but has D and S, and also S is new. But note: we have to avoid E and N? D and S are allowed. However, we have to check if the word is valid.

   CARDS: 
      C A R D S
      Position 1: C (correct)
      Position 2: A (we are testing if A is in position 2? but note: in the secret word, A might be in position 2? or not? We don't know. Also, we have R in position 3? which we haven't tested.

   But wait, the secret word has A, but we don't know if it can be in position 2? It could be. Similarly, R could be in position 3.

   However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have A in position 4 or 5? We don't know.

   Another word: CRAWL? But we have R in position 2 again? We cannot do that because we already know R is not in position 2. So we must avoid putting R in position 2.

   So we cannot use words that have R in the second position.

   Therefore, ""CARDS"" is acceptable because R is in position 3? But wait: in ""CARDS"", the positions are:
        C (1), A (2), R (3), D (4), S (5)

   We are testing:
        A in position 2 (which is new for A) and R in position 3 (which is new for R).

   Also, we are introducing two new letters: D and S.

   But note: the feedback for the first guess said that A is in the word but not in position 3. So if the secret word has A in position 2, then that would be correct? And we would get a check for A in position 2.

   However, if the secret word has A in position 4 or 5, then we would get a dash for A in position 2? and then we would know.

   Similarly, for R: if the secret word has R in position 3, we get a check; if it's in 4 or 5, we get a dash.

   This seems like a good word to test.

   But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? For example, what if the secret word has two A's? Then we might get two A's? But in ""CARDS"", we only have one A. So if the secret word has two A's, we might not get full information? However, we are testing one A at position 2 and we know there's at least one A.

   Alternatively, we could try a word that has A in a different position? For example, put A in position 4? 

   Example: ""CURLY"" -> but that has U and L and Y? and R in position 3? and A is missing? We must include A.

   Another example: ""CHARM"" -> 
        C H A R M
        Here, A is in position 3? But we already know that A is not in position 3 (from the first guess). So we cannot put A in position 3.

   So we must avoid position 3 for A? Yes, because the first guess had A in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? Actually, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, it would be wrong again? But we already know that, so it's a waste. We should try A in a new position: 2,4,5.

   Similarly, for R: avoid position 2.

   Therefore, ""CARDS"" is a valid candidate.

   Another candidate: ""CAMPY""? But that has M and P and Y? and no R? We must include R.

   ""CRWTH""? Not a common word and doesn't have A.

   ""CABIN""? But has B, I, N -> but N is not allowed? We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.

   ""CABIN"" is invalid because of N.

   ""CABLE""? But has E -> not allowed.

   ""CAIRD""? Not a common word.

   ""CARET""? But has E -> not allowed.

   ""CAROB""? -> C A R O B: 
        O and B are new. And it avoids E and N.

   So ""CAROB"" is also a candidate.

   Between ""CARDS"" and ""CAROB"", which one is better? 
        ""CARDS"" has D and S, which are common letters.
        ""CAROB"" has O and B.

   We don't know which letters are more common? But we can choose one.

   Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? But we already have A. The secret word might have other vowels? We don't know.

   Since we are avoiding E, and we have A, the remaining vowels could be I, O, U.

   In ""CAROB"", we have O. In ""CARDS"", we have no vowel (except A). So ""CAROB"" might be better to test a vowel.

   But note: we are only allowed to use words that are valid.

   Let me check: both ""CARDS"" and ""CAROB"" are valid words.

   We can choose ""CAROB"" to test the letter O.

   However, we are also testing R in position 3 and A in position 2.

   Another idea: we know the secret word has C in position 1, and then we have two letters R and A to place. We also have two more letters that are not E or N.

   We might try to put R in position 5 and A in position 4? 

   Example: ""C_ _ A R"" -> what words? 
        ""CIVAR""? not a word.
        ""COLAR""? -> C O L A R: that's a word? Actually, ""collar"" is 6 letters. ""COLAR"" is not common.

   ""CIGAR""? -> but has G and I? and also we have A in position 5? Actually, ""CIGAR"": 
        C I G A R -> A is in position 4? and R in position 5.

   But ""CIGAR"" has I and G? and avoids E and N? and is a valid word.

   So we have multiple options: ""CARDS"", ""CAROB"", ""CIGAR"".

   How to choose? We want to maximize the information.

   In ""CARDS"": 
        We test A in position 2 and R in position 3, and also D and S.
   In ""CAROB"": 
        We test A in position 2 and R in position 3, and also O and B.
   In ""CIGAR"": 
        We test A in position 4 and R in position 5, and also I and G.

   Since we don't have any information about the other two letters, any of these are fine.

   But note: we also want to avoid positions that we know are wrong? Actually, we don't know about the other positions yet.

   However, we know that the secret word does not have E and N, so we are avoiding those.

   I think I'll go with ""CARDS"" because it uses common consonants (D and S).

   But let me think: what if the secret word is ""CRAWL""? But wait, we know that R is not in position 2? So ""CRAWL"" would have R in position 2, which we know is wrong. So it cannot be ""CRAWL"".

   Another possibility: the secret word might be ""CRASS""? 
        But in our first guess, we had ""crane"": 
            C (correct), R (wrong position) -> so R must be in the word but not in position 2. In ""CRASS"", R is in position 2? That would be inconsistent.

   So the secret word must have R in position 3,4, or 5.

   Therefore, ""CRASS"" is not possible.

   Similarly, ""CARTY"" is not a word.

   Let me try to think of the secret word: 
        It starts with C, and has R and A, and two other letters (not E, N). And R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.

   Example: ""CHARM""? But A is in position 3? which we know is wrong? So no.

   ""CLASP"": 
        C L A S P -> A is in position 3? not allowed? So no.

   ""CAMPY"": no R.

   ""CATTY"": no R.

   ""CAROM"": C A R O M -> A in position 2, R in position 3? This is a word? Yes, meaning in billiards.

   So ""CAROM"" is a possibility? But we don't know.

   Therefore, we can try ""CARDS"" to test.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put both A and R in the positions we are testing? But we have to include them.

   Another idea: we can try to put A in position 4 and R in position 3? 

   Example: ""CURAT""? Not a common word.

   Or ""CIRCA"": 
        C I R C A -> but has two C's? and we already know C is in position 1. But the secret word might have two C's? We don't know. Also, we are putting C in position 1 and 4? The feedback for the second C? We don't know.

   However, we are forced to include C in position 1? Actually, we don't have to? But the first letter is fixed as C? Because the feedback said C is correct. So the secret word has C in position 1. So we must start with C.

   But in ""CIRCA"", we have C in position 1 and 4? That's allowed. But we are testing:
        Position 1: C (correct)
        Position 2: I (new)
        Position 3: R (we are testing R in position 3)
        Position 4: C (if the secret word has two C's, then it might be correct? but we don't know if there's a second C)
        Position 5: A (we are testing A in position 5)

   However, we know the secret word has at least one C (in position 1) and one R and one A. It might have more?

   But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about the letters we guessed. We guessed one C and it was correct. So if the secret word has two C's, we wouldn't know until we guess a second C.

   But in ""CIRCA"", we are guessing a second C. That might be useful? But we are also introducing I and using A in position 5.

   However, we are avoiding E and N.

   But ""CIRCA"" is a valid word.

   But note: we are putting R in position 3? and A in position 5? which are new positions.

   This is also a candidate.

   Now, we have several candidates: ""CARDS"", ""CAROB"", ""CIGAR"", ""CIRCA"".

   We need to choose one.

   Let's consider the information we get:

   We want to maximize the chance of getting checks and also cover more letters.

   In ""CIRCA"", we are testing two C's? That might be less likely? But we don't know.

   I think I'll go with ""CARDS"" because it uses common letters and we can get information about A in position 2 and R in position 3.

   So let's choose ""CARDS"".

   But note: we must be cautious. The secret word might have A in position 4? Then in ""CARDS"", we would get:
        C (correct) -> ✓
        A (if the secret word has A in position 4, then A in position 2 is wrong) -> so we get a dash? But wait: if the secret word has only one A and it is in position 4, then we would get:
            Position 2: A -> not present? But wait, the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word. So if we put A in position 2 and the secret word has A in position 4, then we should get a dash for A? Because it's in the word but wrong position.

        Similarly, R in position 3: if the secret word has R in position 4, then we get a dash for R? because it's present but not in position 3.

   So we can get two dashes? That would tell us that both A and R are not in the positions we guessed, so they must be in positions 4 and 5? Then we would know the word is of the form: C _ _ A R? or C _ _ R A? etc.

   Alternatively, if we get a check for A in position 2, then we know A is in position 2. Similarly for R in position 3.

   So it's a good test.

   Therefore, I choose ""CARDS"".

   But wait: what if the secret word is ""CARDS""? Then we would win? But we don't know.

   So let's go with ""CARDS"".

   However, note: we are only on the second guess. We have 5 more tries? Actually, 6 tries total, so we have 5 left? Actually, we have used one, so we have 5 left? But the problem says 6 tries, so we have 5 more.

   So we can try.

   Guess: ""CARDS""

   But let me double-check: 
        We are including R and A? Yes.
        We are avoiding E and N? Yes.
        We are starting with C? Yes.
        We are not putting R in position 2? Yes, R is in position 3.
        We are not putting A in position 3? Yes, A is in position 2? Actually, in ""CARDS"", A is in position 2? That's new.

   So it's valid.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""CARDS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N and E are absent (x).

For the next guess:
- The word must start with C (position 1 fixed).
- Must include R and A (confirmed present), but R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3.
- Must exclude N and E (absent).
- To maximize information, test new positions for R and A while introducing common new letters.

""CARDS"" is chosen because:
- Starts with C (✓).
- Tests A in position 2 (new position for A).
- Tests R in position 3 (new position for R).
- Introduces new letters D and S (common consonants).
- Avoids E, N, and previously invalid positions.

<guess>cards</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: cards -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- R: - (in word, wrong position; so not position 2)
- A: - (in word, wrong position; so not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""cards""
- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- A: ✓ (correct position, position 2)
- R: ✓ (correct position, position 3)
- D: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)

Now, we know:
- The secret word starts with ""CAR"" (positions 1,2,3 are C, A, R respectively).
- The secret word does not contain: N, E, D, S.
- The remaining two letters (positions 4 and 5) are unknown, but must be letters that are not N, E, D, S.

We also know from the first guess that A was not in position 3, but now we have it in position 2 and it's correct. Similarly, R was not in position 2 but is correct in position 3.

Now, we need to find a word that starts with ""CAR"" and has two more letters that are not N, E, D, S.

We have two positions left: 4 and 5.

We must avoid the letters: N, E, D, S.

We also know that the secret word has exactly 5 letters, so we are looking for words of the form ""CAR??"" where the two ? are letters not in {N, E, D, S}.

We can think of common English words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:
- CAR??
  - CARAT: but T is allowed? Yes, but we have to check if T is excluded? We don't have information about T. However, in the first guess, we didn't have T, so it could be. But note: CARAT has A at the end? But we already have A in position 2, and the secret word might have two A's? We don't know. Also, we have to avoid D and S? CARAT has T, which is not excluded. But wait, in the second guess, we have D and S excluded, but T is not excluded. So CARAT is a candidate? But let's see: CARAT has two A's? The secret word might have two A's? We don't know. But we can try.

  However, we are on the third guess and we know the first three letters. We can try to guess the entire word.

  But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters: N, E, D, S.

  Let's list some common words starting with ""CAR"" that don't have N, E, D, S:

  - CARAT: C A R A T -> positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:A, 5:T -> but we have A in position 4? We don't know if that's allowed? The secret word might have two A's? Also, we haven't excluded T.

  - CAROB: but we excluded D and S? CAROB has O and B, which are not excluded. But in the second guess, we had D and S excluded, but O and B are new. However, we know the word must be 5 letters and start with CAR. CAROB: C A R O B -> but we have O and B. Is that a word? Yes.

  - CAROL: but has O and L? But L is not excluded. However, we have to avoid E, N, D, S. L is allowed. But CAROL has O and L? But wait, CAROL: C A R O L -> that's a word. But note: we have O and L.

  - CAROM: C A R O M -> M is allowed.

  - CARPY: C A R P Y -> P and Y allowed.

  - CART: too short.

  - CARVE: but E is excluded -> not allowed.

  - CARBS: but S is excluded -> not allowed.

  - CARD: too short.

  - CARTS: S excluded.

  - CARED: E and D excluded.

  So possible words: CARAT, CAROB, CAROL, CAROM, CARPY, etc.

  But we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? For example, CARAT has two A's.

  How can we confirm? We can try one of these.

  Since we have two positions to guess, and we have limited information, we can choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet to get more information? But we already know the first three letters are fixed. So we are only guessing the last two.

  However, we don't know the last two, so we need to test possibilities.

  But note: we have only two positions, so we can try a word that covers multiple possibilities? But we are forced to put specific letters.

  Actually, we are going to guess a full word that starts with ""CAR"" and then two letters that are not excluded.

  We can try ""CAROL"" because it uses O and L, which are common.

  But let me see: if we guess ""CAROL"", then:
      Position 4: O -> if it's correct, we get a check; if not, we get a dash or x? But we don't know if O is in the word.
      Similarly, position 5: L.

  But we are not sure.

  Alternatively, we can try ""CARAT"" to test if there is a T and a second A.

  However, we already know that A is in the word (from first guess) and we have it in position 2. But if we put A in position 4, and if the secret word has two A's, then we get a check? Or if not, we get a dash? But we know A is in the word, so if we put A in position 4 and it's not there, we get a dash meaning it's in the word but wrong position? But we already have A in position 2 which is correct, so the dash would indicate that there is another A? Actually, no: the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong position is a dash, and if it's in the word and in the correct position, it's a check.

  But if the secret word has only one A, and we put A in position 4, then we would get a dash? Because the A is in the word but not in position 4? But wait, the A is already in position 2, so if we put an extra A in position 4 and the secret word has only one A, then the feedback for the second A might be an 'x'? Because there is no second A.

  The feedback in Wordle: if you guess a letter that appears more times than in the secret word, the extra ones are marked as absent (x). So if the secret word has only one A, and we guess two A's, then one of them (the one in the wrong position) will be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback is given per position. The first A (position 2) is correct, so it gets a check. The second A (position 4) would be marked as absent (x) because there is no second A.

  So if we guess ""CARAT"" and the secret word is ""CAROL"", then:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓ (position 2)
      R: ✓
      A: x (because no second A)
      T: x (if T is not in the word)

  That would tell us that there is no second A and no T.

  But if the secret word is ""CARAT"", then we get all correct.

  So we can try ""CARAT"".

  But we have other possibilities.

  Since we have limited time, and we know the first three letters, we can try to think of the most common words.

  Common 5-letter words starting with ""CAR"":
    CARET (but E excluded)
    CARES (E and S excluded)
    CAROL
    CARGO (G and O? but G is not excluded? and O? and we have to avoid E, N, D, S. G and O are allowed. But CARGO: C A R G O -> that's a word. But we haven't excluded G or O.

  So CARGO is also a candidate.

  We have many: CARAT, CAROB, CAROL, CAROM, CARGO, CARPI, CARPS, CARVY, etc.

  How to choose? We can choose one that uses common letters to get information.

  Alternatively, we can choose one that we think is most likely.

  But note: we have already excluded D, S, E, N. The remaining letters are more likely to be vowels or common consonants.

  We haven't tried: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  We can try to include a vowel in position 4? Because many words have vowels in the middle.

  For example, O is a common vowel.

  So words like CAROL, CARGO, CAROM have O.

  Or CARAT has A (which we already know) and T.

  Let me check the frequency: in English, after ""CAR"", common continuations are with a vowel? Like O, I, E (but E is excluded) or a consonant.

  Since E is excluded, O is a good candidate.

  So I'll go with ""CAROL"".

  But let's see: if we guess ""CAROL"", and the secret word is ""CARGO"", then we get:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      R: ✓
      O: ? -> if the secret word has O in position 4, then ✓; if not, then if O is in the word but wrong position, we get dash; if not in word, x.
      L: similarly.

  But we don't know.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has two new letters that are very common to maximize the chance of hitting.

  But we are only guessing two letters.

  I think we should try ""CAROL"" because it is a common word.

  But wait, the feedback from the second guess: we had ""CARDS"" and we got C,A,R correct and D,S absent. So the secret word is ""CAR??"" and the two letters are not D or S, and not E or N.

  Another common word is ""CARGO"". 

  Let me see: CARGO is more common than CAROL? Not sure.

  We can also consider ""CARAT"" if we think there might be a T.

  But to make a decision, I'll choose ""CARGO"" because it has two common letters: G and O.

  However, we don't have information about G and O.

  But note: we are on the third guess, and we have three more guesses after this? Actually, we have 6 total, we used 2, so 4 left? But we can try.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat any of the excluded letters and uses new ones.

  I think I'll go with ""CARGO"".

  But let me confirm: ""CARGO"" is C A R G O.

  We haven't excluded G or O.

  So:

  <guess>cargo</guess>

  But wait, what if the secret word is ""CAROL""? Then we get:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      R: ✓
      G: x (if not in word)
      O: - (if O is in the word but not in position 4? because in ""CAROL"", O is in position 4? Actually, in ""CAROL"", O is in position 4? 
          C A R O L -> O is position 4, L is position 5.

      So if we guess ""CARGO"" and the secret word is ""CAROL"", then:
          Position 4: G -> not in word? so x
          Position 5: O -> in the word? but in position 4, not 5? so dash? 

      But wait, the secret word ""CAROL"" has O in position 4, so if we put O in position 5, it should be marked as dash (present but wrong position) because there is an O in the word but not in position 5.

      Then we would know that O is in the word but not in position 5, and since we know the first three, we can deduce that O must be in position 4? because position 1,2,3 are fixed. Then we can try ""CAROL"" next.

  Similarly, if we guess ""CARGO"" and the secret word is ""CARGO"", we win.

  If the secret word is ""CARAT"", then:
      Position 4: G -> x
      Position 5: O -> x
      Then we know that the last two letters are not G and O, and we can try another word.

  So ""CARGO"" is a good test.

  But we have many possibilities. We might not get it in one guess.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has as many new letters as possible? But we are only guessing two new letters.

  I think ""CARGO"" is a reasonable choice.

  But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters? 

  Another idea: we can try ""CARLY""? But Y is allowed? and L. But ""CARLY"" is a name? Not sure if it's accepted. Usually, Wordle uses common words.

  ""CARET"" is out because of E.

  ""CARTY"" not a word.

  ""CARVY"" not common.

  So I'll go with ""CARGO"".

  Therefore, the next guess is ""CARGO"".Based on the feedback:
- The first three letters are confirmed as C, A, R in positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively (from ""crane"" and ""cards"").
- D and S are absent (from ""cards""), in addition to previously excluded N and E (from ""crane"").
- The secret word is of the form ""CAR??"", where the last two letters are not D, S, N, or E.

Possible words include CARGO, CAROL, CAROB, CARAT, CAROM, etc. ""CARGO"" is chosen because:
- It tests common letters (G and O) not yet tried.
- It avoids excluded letters (D, S, N, E).
- It efficiently narrows down possibilities for positions 4 and 5.

Actually, note: the feedback for R is \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3).\n - N and E are not in the word at all.\n\n So, we know:\n   Position 1: C (fixed)\n   The word contains: C, R, A (and two more letters, since N and E are absent)\n   The word does not contain: N, E.\n\n Also, note that R and A are present but not in the positions we guessed (2 and 3 respectively). Therefore:\n   R must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But wait, position 1 is C, so R cannot be there. So positions available for R: 3,4,5.\n   Similarly, A must be in position 2,4,5? But note: we guessed A in position 3 and it was wrong, so A cannot be in position 3. Also, position 1 is C, so A cannot be there. Therefore, A must be in position 2,4, or 5.\n\n However, we must also consider that the word has 5 letters and we have three known letters: C, R, A.\n\n We have two more letters to discover, and they are not N or E.\n\n Now, for the next guess, we want to try to place R and A in different positions and also try to find the remaining letters.\n\n Constraints for the next guess:\n   - Must be a 5-letter English word.\n   - Must start with C (because position 1 is fixed as C and correct).\n   - Must include R and A (because they are in the secret word) but in positions different from the first guess for the ones that were marked wrong (so R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3).\n   - Must not include N or E.\n\n We can try to form a word that starts with C, and then put R and A in positions that are allowed.\n\n Let\'s think of words that start with C and have R and A, and avoid N and E.\n\n We also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\n Possible positions for R: 3,4,5\n Possible positions for A: 2,4,5\n\n But note: we cannot put R in position 2 again (we already tried and it was wrong) and A in position 3 (tried and wrong).\n\n We can try to put A in position 2? That would be a new position for A. And R in position 4 or 5? Or we can try R in position 3 and A in position 4? etc.\n\n Let\'s list some words:\n\n Option 1: Put A in position 2 and R in position 4? Then we have: C A _ R _\n But we need to fill the 3rd and 5th letters. We cannot use N or E.\n\n What words? For example: \n   CAR? ... but we need 5 letters.\n\n Let\'s try: \n   CARAT? But that has T which is new. Also, note: we have A in position 2 and 5? But we only know one A is in the word? Actually, the word might have two A\'s? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates.\n\n However, in our first guess we had only one A. So if the secret word has two A\'s, then we would have known? Actually, no: the feedback for the first guess only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we guessed one A and it was present (but in wrong position), there could be another A? But we don\'t know.\n\n But to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters.\n\n However, for now, let\'s assume we don\'t know. We can try a word that has A in position 2 and R in position 4.\n\n Example: ""CARAT"" -> C A R A T? But wait, we have R in position 3? We want to avoid putting R in position 2 (which we did) but we are putting R in position 3? That\'s allowed because we haven\'t tried R in position 3 yet.\n\n However, note: in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put R in position 3, that might be correct? Or it might be in 4 or 5.\n\n But we also have to avoid putting A in position 3? In this word ""CARAT"", we have A in position 2 and 4? And we have R in position 3.\n\n Let\'s check: \n   Position 1: C (correct)\n   Position 2: A -> we don\'t know if it\'s correct? We haven\'t tried A in position 2 before.\n   Position 3: R -> we haven\'t tried R in position 3 before? But in the first guess we had R in position 2 and it was wrong, so R is not in 2, but it could be in 3.\n\n However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have only one R? We don\'t know.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess: R was marked as present (but wrong position). So if we put R in position 3 in the second guess and it is correct, then we get a check. If it is still wrong, we get a dash.\n\n Alternatively, we might try to put R in a completely new position (like 5) and A in a new position (like 4) to test.\n\n We also want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me think of words that start with C, have R and A, and avoid E and N.\n\n Some words:\n   CARTY? (not a word)\n   CARDS? -> but has D and S, and also S is new. But note: we have to avoid E and N? D and S are allowed. However, we have to check if the word is valid.\n\n   CARDS: \n      C A R D S\n      Position 1: C (correct)\n      Position 2: A (we are testing if A is in position 2? but note: in the secret word, A might be in position 2? or not? We don\'t know. Also, we have R in position 3? which we haven\'t tested.\n\n   But wait, the secret word has A, but we don\'t know if it can be in position 2? It could be. Similarly, R could be in position 3.\n\n   However, we also have to consider that the secret word might have A in position 4 or 5? We don\'t know.\n\n   Another word: CRAWL? But we have R in position 2 again? We cannot do that because we already know R is not in position 2. So we must avoid putting R in position 2.\n\n   So we cannot use words that have R in the second position.\n\n   Therefore, ""CARDS"" is acceptable because R is in position 3? But wait: in ""CARDS"", the positions are:\n        C (1), A (2), R (3), D (4), S (5)\n\n   We are testing:\n        A in position 2 (which is new for A) and R in position 3 (which is new for R).\n\n   Also, we are introducing two new letters: D and S.\n\n   But note: the feedback for the first guess said that A is in the word but not in position 3. So if the secret word has A in position 2, then that would be correct? And we would get a check for A in position 2.\n\n   However, if the secret word has A in position 4 or 5, then we would get a dash for A in position 2? and then we would know.\n\n   Similarly, for R: if the secret word has R in position 3, we get a check; if it\'s in 4 or 5, we get a dash.\n\n   This seems like a good word to test.\n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? For example, what if the secret word has two A\'s? Then we might get two A\'s? But in ""CARDS"", we only have one A. So if the secret word has two A\'s, we might not get full information? However, we are testing one A at position 2 and we know there\'s at least one A.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try a word that has A in a different position? For example, put A in position 4? \n\n   Example: ""CURLY"" -> but that has U and L and Y? and R in position 3? and A is missing? We must include A.\n\n   Another example: ""CHARM"" -> \n        C H A R M\n        Here, A is in position 3? But we already know that A is not in position 3 (from the first guess). So we cannot put A in position 3.\n\n   So we must avoid position 3 for A? Yes, because the first guess had A in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? Actually, no: the feedback for A was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, it would be wrong again? But we already know that, so it\'s a waste. We should try A in a new position: 2,4,5.\n\n   Similarly, for R: avoid position 2.\n\n   Therefore, ""CARDS"" is a valid candidate.\n\n   Another candidate: ""CAMPY""? But that has M and P and Y? and no R? We must include R.\n\n   ""CRWTH""? Not a common word and doesn\'t have A.\n\n   ""CABIN""? But has B, I, N -> but N is not allowed? We know N is absent. So we cannot use N.\n\n   ""CABIN"" is invalid because of N.\n\n   ""CABLE""? But has E -> not allowed.\n\n   ""CAIRD""? Not a common word.\n\n   ""CARET""? But has E -> not allowed.\n\n   ""CAROB""? -> C A R O B: \n        O and B are new. And it avoids E and N.\n\n   So ""CAROB"" is also a candidate.\n\n   Between ""CARDS"" and ""CAROB"", which one is better? \n        ""CARDS"" has D and S, which are common letters.\n        ""CAROB"" has O and B.\n\n   We don\'t know which letters are more common? But we can choose one.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to cover more vowels? But we already have A. The secret word might have other vowels? We don\'t know.\n\n   Since we are avoiding E, and we have A, the remaining vowels could be I, O, U.\n\n   In ""CAROB"", we have O. In ""CARDS"", we have no vowel (except A). So ""CAROB"" might be better to test a vowel.\n\n   But note: we are only allowed to use words that are valid.\n\n   Let me check: both ""CARDS"" and ""CAROB"" are valid words.\n\n   We can choose ""CAROB"" to test the letter O.\n\n   However, we are also testing R in position 3 and A in position 2.\n\n   Another idea: we know the secret word has C in position 1, and then we have two letters R and A to place. We also have two more letters that are not E or N.\n\n   We might try to put R in position 5 and A in position 4? \n\n   Example: ""C_ _ A R"" -> what words? \n        ""CIVAR""? not a word.\n        ""COLAR""? -> C O L A R: that\'s a word? Actually, ""collar"" is 6 letters. ""COLAR"" is not common.\n\n   ""CIGAR""? -> but has G and I? and also we have A in position 5? Actually, ""CIGAR"": \n        C I G A R -> A is in position 4? and R in position 5.\n\n   But ""CIGAR"" has I and G? and avoids E and N? and is a valid word.\n\n   So we have multiple options: ""CARDS"", ""CAROB"", ""CIGAR"".\n\n   How to choose? We want to maximize the information.\n\n   In ""CARDS"": \n        We test A in position 2 and R in position 3, and also D and S.\n   In ""CAROB"": \n        We test A in position 2 and R in position 3, and also O and B.\n   In ""CIGAR"": \n        We test A in position 4 and R in position 5, and also I and G.\n\n   Since we don\'t have any information about the other two letters, any of these are fine.\n\n   But note: we also want to avoid positions that we know are wrong? Actually, we don\'t know about the other positions yet.\n\n   However, we know that the secret word does not have E and N, so we are avoiding those.\n\n   I think I\'ll go with ""CARDS"" because it uses common consonants (D and S).\n\n   But let me think: what if the secret word is ""CRAWL""? But wait, we know that R is not in position 2? So ""CRAWL"" would have R in position 2, which we know is wrong. So it cannot be ""CRAWL"".\n\n   Another possibility: the secret word might be ""CRASS""? \n        But in our first guess, we had ""crane"": \n            C (correct), R (wrong position) -> so R must be in the word but not in position 2. In ""CRASS"", R is in position 2? That would be inconsistent.\n\n   So the secret word must have R in position 3,4, or 5.\n\n   Therefore, ""CRASS"" is not possible.\n\n   Similarly, ""CARTY"" is not a word.\n\n   Let me try to think of the secret word: \n        It starts with C, and has R and A, and two other letters (not E, N). And R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.\n\n   Example: ""CHARM""? But A is in position 3? which we know is wrong? So no.\n\n   ""CLASP"": \n        C L A S P -> A is in position 3? not allowed? So no.\n\n   ""CAMPY"": no R.\n\n   ""CATTY"": no R.\n\n   ""CAROM"": C A R O M -> A in position 2, R in position 3? This is a word? Yes, meaning in billiards.\n\n   So ""CAROM"" is a possibility? But we don\'t know.\n\n   Therefore, we can try ""CARDS"" to test.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put both A and R in the positions we are testing? But we have to include them.\n\n   Another idea: we can try to put A in position 4 and R in position 3? \n\n   Example: ""CURAT""? Not a common word.\n\n   Or ""CIRCA"": \n        C I R C A -> but has two C\'s? and we already know C is in position 1. But the secret word might have two C\'s? We don\'t know. Also, we are putting C in position 1 and 4? The feedback for the second C? We don\'t know.\n\n   However, we are forced to include C in position 1? Actually, we don\'t have to? But the first letter is fixed as C? Because the feedback said C is correct. So the secret word has C in position 1. So we must start with C.\n\n   But in ""CIRCA"", we have C in position 1 and 4? That\'s allowed. But we are testing:\n        Position 1: C (correct)\n        Position 2: I (new)\n        Position 3: R (we are testing R in position 3)\n        Position 4: C (if the secret word has two C\'s, then it might be correct? but we don\'t know if there\'s a second C)\n        Position 5: A (we are testing A in position 5)\n\n   However, we know the secret word has at least one C (in position 1) and one R and one A. It might have more?\n\n   But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about the letters we guessed. We guessed one C and it was correct. So if the secret word has two C\'s, we wouldn\'t know until we guess a second C.\n\n   But in ""CIRCA"", we are guessing a second C. That might be useful? But we are also introducing I and using A in position 5.\n\n   However, we are avoiding E and N.\n\n   But ""CIRCA"" is a valid word.\n\n   But note: we are putting R in position 3? and A in position 5? which are new positions.\n\n   This is also a candidate.\n\n   Now, we have several candidates: ""CARDS"", ""CAROB"", ""CIGAR"", ""CIRCA"".\n\n   We need to choose one.\n\n   Let\'s consider the information we get:\n\n   We want to maximize the chance of getting checks and also cover more letters.\n\n   In ""CIRCA"", we are testing two C\'s? That might be less likely? But we don\'t know.\n\n   I think I\'ll go with ""CARDS"" because it uses common letters and we can get information about A in position 2 and R in position 3.\n\n   So let\'s choose ""CARDS"".\n\n   But note: we must be cautious. The secret word might have A in position 4? Then in ""CARDS"", we would get:\n        C (correct) -> ✓\n        A (if the secret word has A in position 4, then A in position 2 is wrong) -> so we get a dash? But wait: if the secret word has only one A and it is in position 4, then we would get:\n            Position 2: A -> not present? But wait, the feedback for the first guess said A is in the word. So if we put A in position 2 and the secret word has A in position 4, then we should get a dash for A? Because it\'s in the word but wrong position.\n\n        Similarly, R in position 3: if the secret word has R in position 4, then we get a dash for R? because it\'s present but not in position 3.\n\n   So we can get two dashes? That would tell us that both A and R are not in the positions we guessed, so they must be in positions 4 and 5? Then we would know the word is of the form: C _ _ A R? or C _ _ R A? etc.\n\n   Alternatively, if we get a check for A in position 2, then we know A is in position 2. Similarly for R in position 3.\n\n   So it\'s a good test.\n\n   Therefore, I choose ""CARDS"".\n\n   But wait: what if the secret word is ""CARDS""? Then we would win? But we don\'t know.\n\n   So let\'s go with ""CARDS"".\n\n   However, note: we are only on the second guess. We have 5 more tries? Actually, 6 tries total, so we have 5 left? Actually, we have used one, so we have 5 left? But the problem says 6 tries, so we have 5 more.\n\n   So we can try.\n\n   Guess: ""CARDS""\n\n   But let me double-check: \n        We are including R and A? Yes.\n        We are avoiding E and N?

Actually, in ""CARDS"", A is in position 2? That\'s new.\n\n   So it\'s valid.\n\n   Therefore, the next guess is ""CARDS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).\n- N and E are absent (x).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must start with C (position 1 fixed).\n- Must include R and A (confirmed present), but R cannot be in position 2, and A cannot be in position 3.\n- Must exclude N and E (absent).\n- To maximize information, test new positions for R and A while introducing common new letters.\n\n""CARDS"" is chosen because:\n- Starts with C (✓).\n- Tests A in position 2 (new position for A).\n- Tests R in position 3 (new position for R).\n- Introduces new letters D and S (common consonants).\n- Avoids E, N, and previously invalid positions.\n\n<guess>cards</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: cards -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)\n- R: - (in word, wrong position; so not position 2)\n- A: - (in word, wrong position; so not position 3)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""cards""\n- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)\n- A: ✓ (correct position, position 2)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, position 3)\n- D: x (not in word)\n- S: x (not in word)\n\nNow, we know:\n- The secret word starts with ""CAR"" (positions 1,2,3 are C, A, R respectively).\n- The secret word does not contain: N, E, D, S.\n- The remaining two letters (positions 4 and 5) are unknown, but must be letters that are not N, E, D, S.\n\nWe also know from the first guess that A was not in position 3, but now we have it in position 2 and it\'s correct. Similarly, R was not in position 2 but is correct in position 3.\n\nNow, we need to find a word that starts with ""CAR"" and has two more letters that are not N, E, D, S.\n\nWe have two positions left: 4 and 5.\n\nWe must avoid the letters: N, E, D, S.\n\nWe also know that the secret word has exactly 5 letters, so we are looking for words of the form ""CAR??"" where the two ? are letters not in {N, E, D, S}.\n\nWe can think of common English words that fit this pattern.\n\nPossible words:\n- CAR??\n  - CARAT: but T is allowed? Yes, but we have to check if T is excluded? We don\'t have information about T. However, in the first guess, we didn\'t have T, so it could be. But note: CARAT has A at the end? But we already have A in position 2, and the secret word might have two A\'s? We don\'t know. Also, we have to avoid D and S? CARAT has T, which is not excluded. But wait, in the second guess, we have D and S excluded, but T is not excluded. So CARAT is a candidate? But let\'s see: CARAT has two A\'s? The secret word might have two A\'s? We don\'t know. But we can try.\n\n  However, we are on the third guess and we know the first three letters. We can try to guess the entire word.\n\n  But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters: N, E, D, S.\n\n  Let\'s list some common words starting with ""CAR"" that don\'t have N, E, D, S:\n\n  - CARAT: C A R A T -> positions: 1:C, 2:A, 3:R, 4:A, 5:T -> but we have A in position 4? We don\'t know if that\'s allowed? The secret word might have two A\'s? Also, we haven\'t excluded T.\n\n  - CAROB: but we excluded D and S? CAROB has O and B, which are not excluded. But in the second guess, we had D and S excluded, but O and B are new. However, we know the word must be 5 letters and start with CAR. CAROB: C A R O B -> but we have O and B. Is that a word? Yes.\n\n  - CAROL: but has O and L? But L is not excluded. However, we have to avoid E, N, D, S. L is allowed. But CAROL has O and L? But wait, CAROL: C A R O L -> that\'s a word. But note: we have O and L.\n\n  - CAROM: C A R O M -> M is allowed.\n\n  - CARPY: C A R P Y -> P and Y allowed.\n\n  - CART: too short.\n\n  - CARVE: but E is excluded -> not allowed.\n\n  - CARBS: but S is excluded -> not allowed.\n\n  - CARD: too short.\n\n  - CARTS: S excluded.\n\n  - CARED: E and D excluded.\n\n  So possible words: CARAT, CAROB, CAROL, CAROM, CARPY, etc.\n\n  But we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? For example, CARAT has two A\'s.\n\n  How can we confirm? We can try one of these.\n\n  Since we have two positions to guess, and we have limited information, we can choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that uses letters we haven\'t tried yet to get more information? But we already know the first three letters are fixed. So we are only guessing the last two.\n\n  However, we don\'t know the last two, so we need to test possibilities.\n\n  But note: we have only two positions, so we can try a word that covers multiple possibilities? But we are forced to put specific letters.\n\n  Actually, we are going to guess a full word that starts with ""CAR"" and then two letters that are not excluded.\n\n  We can try ""CAROL"" because it uses O and L, which are common.\n\n  But let me see: if we guess ""CAROL"", then:\n      Position 4: O -> if it\'s correct, we get a check; if not, we get a dash or x? But we don\'t know if O is in the word.\n      Similarly, position 5: L.\n\n  But we are not sure.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try ""CARAT"" to test if there is a T and a second A.\n\n  However, we already know that A is in the word (from first guess) and we have it in position 2. But if we put A in position 4, and if the secret word has two A\'s, then we get a check? Or if not, we get a dash? But we know A is in the word, so if we put A in position 4 and it\'s not there, we get a dash meaning it\'s in the word but wrong position? But we already have A in position 2 which is correct, so the dash would indicate that there is another A? Actually, no: the feedback for a letter that is in the word but in the wrong position is a dash, and if it\'s in the word and in the correct position, it\'s a check.\n\n  But if the secret word has only one A, and we put A in position 4, then we would get a dash? Because the A is in the word but not in position 4? But wait, the A is already in position 2, so if we put an extra A in position 4 and the secret word has only one A, then the feedback for the second A might be an \'x\'? Because there is no second A.\n\n  The feedback in Wordle: if you guess a letter that appears more times than in the secret word, the extra ones are marked as absent (x). So if the secret word has only one A, and we guess two A\'s, then one of them (the one in the wrong position) will be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback is given per position. The first A (position 2) is correct, so it gets a check. The second A (position 4) would be marked as absent (x) because there is no second A.\n\n  So if we guess ""CARAT"" and the secret word is ""CAROL"", then:\n      C: ✓\n      A: ✓ (position 2)\n      R: ✓\n      A: x (because no second A)\n      T: x (if T is not in the word)\n\n  That would tell us that there is no second A and no T.\n\n  But if the secret word is ""CARAT"", then we get all correct.\n\n  So we can try ""CARAT"".\n\n  But we have other possibilities.\n\n  Since we have limited time, and we know the first three letters, we can try to think of the most common words.\n\n  Common 5-letter words starting with ""CAR"":\n    CARET (but E excluded)\n    CARES (E and S excluded)\n    CAROL\n    CARGO (G and O? but G is not excluded? and O? and we have to avoid E, N, D, S. G and O are allowed. But CARGO: C A R G O -> that\'s a word. But we haven\'t excluded G or O.\n\n  So CARGO is also a candidate.\n\n  We have many: CARAT, CAROB, CAROL, CAROM, CARGO, CARPI, CARPS, CARVY, etc.\n\n  How to choose? We can choose one that uses common letters to get information.\n\n  Alternatively, we can choose one that we think is most likely.\n\n  But note: we have already excluded D, S, E, N. The remaining letters are more likely to be vowels or common consonants.\n\n  We haven\'t tried: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n  We can try to include a vowel in position 4? Because many words have vowels in the middle.\n\n  For example, O is a common vowel.\n\n  So words like CAROL, CARGO, CAROM have O.\n\n  Or CARAT has A (which we already know) and T.\n\n  Let me check the frequency: in English, after ""CAR"", common continuations are with a vowel? Like O, I, E (but E is excluded) or a consonant.\n\n  Since E is excluded, O is a good candidate.\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""CAROL"".\n\n  But let\'s see: if we guess ""CAROL"", and the secret word is ""CARGO"", then we get:\n      C: ✓\n      A: ✓\n      R: ✓\n      O: ? -> if the secret word has O in position 4, then ✓; if not, then if O is in the word but wrong position, we get dash; if not in word, x.\n      L: similarly.\n\n  But we don\'t know.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has two new letters that are very common to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\n  But we are only guessing two letters.\n\n  I think we should try ""CAROL"" because it is a common word.\n\n  But wait, the feedback from the second guess: we had ""CARDS"" and we got C,A,R correct and D,S absent. So the secret word is ""CAR??"" and the two letters are not D or S, and not E or N.\n\n  Another common word is ""CARGO"". \n\n  Let me see: CARGO is more common than CAROL? Not sure.\n\n  We can also consider ""CARAT"" if we think there might be a T.\n\n  But to make a decision, I\'ll choose ""CARGO"" because it has two common letters: G and O.\n\n  However, we don\'t have information about G and O.\n\n  But note: we are on the third guess, and we have three more guesses after this? Actually, we have 6 total, we used 2, so 4 left? But we can try.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t repeat any of the excluded letters and uses new ones.\n\n  I think I\'ll go with ""CARGO"".\n\n  But let me confirm: ""CARGO"" is C A R G O.\n\n  We haven\'t excluded G or O.\n\n  So:\n\n  <guess>cargo</guess>\n\n  But wait, what if the secret word is ""CAROL""? Then we get:\n      C: ✓\n      A: ✓\n      R: ✓\n      G: x (if not in word)\n      O: - (if O is in the word but not in position 4? because in ""CAROL"", O is in position 4? Actually, in ""CAROL"", O is in position 4? \n          C A R O L -> O is position 4, L is position 5.\n\n      So if we guess ""CARGO"" and the secret word is ""CAROL"", then:\n          Position 4: G -> not in word? so x\n          Position 5: O -> in the word? but in position 4, not 5? so dash? \n\n      But wait, the secret word ""CAROL"" has O in position 4, so if we put O in position 5, it should be marked as dash (present but wrong position) because there is an O in the word but not in position 5.\n\n      Then we would know that O is in the word but not in position 5, and since we know the first three, we can deduce that O must be in position 4? because position 1,2,3 are fixed. Then we can try ""CAROL"" next.\n\n  Similarly, if we guess ""CARGO"" and the secret word is ""CARGO"", we win.\n\n  If the secret word is ""CARAT"", then:\n      Position 4: G -> x\n      Position 5: O -> x\n      Then we know that the last two letters are not G and O, and we can try another word.\n\n  So ""CARGO"" is a good test.\n\n  But we have many possibilities. We might not get it in one guess.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has as many new letters as possible? But we are only guessing two new letters.\n\n  I think ""CARGO"" is a reasonable choice.\n\n  But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters? \n\n  Another idea: we can try ""CARLY""? But Y is allowed? and L. But ""CARLY"" is a name? Not sure if it\'s accepted. Usually, Wordle uses common words.\n\n  ""CARET"" is out because of E.\n\n  ""CARTY"" not a word.\n\n  ""CARVY"" not common.\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""CARGO"".\n\n  Therefore, the next guess is ""CARGO"".Based on the feedback:\n- The first three letters are confirmed as C, A, R in positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively (from ""crane"" and ""cards"").\n- D and S are absent (from ""cards""), in addition to previously excluded N and E (from ""crane"").\n- The secret word is of the form ""CAR??"", where the last two letters are not D, S, N, or E.\n\nPossible words include CARGO, CAROL, CAROB, CARAT, CAROM, etc. ""CARGO"" is chosen because:\n- It tests common letters (G and O) not yet tried.\n- It avoids excluded letters (D, S, N, E).\n- It efficiently narrows down possibilities for positions 4 and 5.\n\n<guess>cargo</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: cards -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: cargo -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) G(x) O(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (position 1 correct)
- R: - (in word, but not position 2)
- A: - (in word, but not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""cards""
- C: ✓ (position 1 correct)
- A: ✓ (position 2 correct)
- R: ✓ (position 3 correct)
- D: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""cargo""
- C: ✓ (position 1 correct)
- A: ✓ (position 2 correct)
- R: ✓ (position 3 correct)
- G: x (not in word)
- O: - (in word, but not position 5)

Now, we know:
- The secret word starts with ""CAR"" (positions 1,2,3 are C, A, R).
- The secret word contains the letter O, but not in position 5 (from the feedback of ""cargo"").
- The secret word does not contain: N, E, D, S, G (from the x's in all guesses).

Additionally, from the first guess, we know that A was not in position 3 (but now we have it in position 2, which is correct) and R was not in position 2 (but now in position 3, correct). So that is consistent.

Now, the secret word is ""CAR"" followed by two more letters. We know the fourth and fifth letters are not D, S, G, and also not N or E. Moreover, the word contains an O, but not in position 5.

Since the O is in the word but not in position 5, and the only positions left are 4 and 5 (but not 5 for O), then O must be in position 4.

Why? Because the word has only five positions. We have positions 1,2,3 fixed as C,A,R. So positions 4 and 5 are unknown. The O cannot be in position 5 (from the feedback of ""cargo"": O in position 5 is marked as '-', meaning it is in the word but not in that position). Therefore, O must be in position 4.

But wait, what if the word has two O's? Then O could be in position 4 and also in position 5? But we don't know. However, the feedback for ""cargo"" only shows one O (in position 5) and it is marked as '-', meaning there is at least one O and it's not in position 5. It doesn't tell us if there is a second O.

But if there is a second O, it could be in position 4? Or if there is only one O, it must be in position 4.

So the secret word must have O in position 4? Not necessarily, because if there is only one O, then it must be in position 4. But if there are two O's, then one could be in position 4 and the other in position 5? But we have a problem: in ""cargo"", we put O in position 5 and got a dash, meaning that there is an O in the word that is not in position 5. That O could be in position 4. But if there is an O in position 5 as well, then we would have two O's. However, the feedback for the O in position 5 would still be a dash? No, if the secret word has an O in position 5, then we would get a check for that position. But we got a dash, so the secret word does not have an O in position 5. Therefore, the secret word has at least one O, but not in position 5. So the O must be in position 4? Because that's the only position left? Not exactly: the O could be in a position we already have? But positions 1,2,3 are fixed and are C,A,R. None of them is O. So the only possibility for O is position 4.

Therefore, the secret word must have O in position 4.

So the word is ""CARO?"".

Now, we need to find the fifth letter. The fifth letter must be a letter that is not N, E, D, S, G, and it must form a valid English word.

Also, note that the word must be 5 letters.

So we are looking for words of the form ""CARO*"", where * is a letter not in {N, E, D, S, G}.

Possible words:

- CAROL: but L is not excluded? But wait, we haven't excluded L. However, let's check: if the fifth letter is L, then ""CAROL"". But we have to see if it meets the feedback.

But we have feedback that O is in the word and not in position 5. In ""CAROL"", O is in position 4, so that matches. The fifth letter is L.

But is L excluded? No, we haven't guessed L and it hasn't been marked as absent.

Similarly, other possibilities:

- CAROM: M is not excluded.
- CAROB: B is not excluded.
- CAROT: T is not excluded? But ""CAROT"" is not a common word; usually ""carrot"" has two R's? But ""carot"" is not a word. ""Carrot"" is 6 letters? No, ""carrot"" is 6 letters? C-A-R-R-O-T, that's 6. So not.

- CAROW: not a word.

- CAROP: not common.

- CAROA: not a word.

Common words: CAROL, CAROM, CAROB.

But CAROB: C A R O B -> that's a word (a type of bean).

CAROM: C A R O M -> a billiards term.

CAROL: C A R O L -> a song or a name.

Now, we have to choose one. But note: we also have the feedback from the first guess. In the first guess, we had ""crane"", and we know that A was in the word but not in position 3. That is satisfied because now A is in position 2.

Similarly, R was in the word but not in position 2, now in position 3.

Now, for the fifth letter, we need to find which one is the correct one.

We can try ""CAROL"" because it's common.

But let me see: we have not excluded any of B, L, M, etc.

We can also consider the possibility of duplicate letters? But in this case, we don't have any duplicate so far.

But note: in the secret word, we have O in position 4, and the fifth letter is unknown.

We can try to guess ""CAROL"" and see.

But we have one more thing: in the feedback for ""cargo"", we have O marked as dash for position 5, which is consistent with the secret word having O in position 4 and not 5.

Now, if we guess ""CAROL"", then:

- If the secret word is ""CAROL"", we win.

- If not, we get feedback on L.

Similarly, if we guess ""CAROB"", we test B.

But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can think: are there any other constraints?

We know that the secret word must have been in the Wordle word list.

I think ""CAROL"" is a very common word, so I'll try that.

But let me check: we have excluded letters: N, E, D, S, G.

We haven't tried: B, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

But for ""CARO*"", the common endings are L, B, M.

We can try ""CAROL"".

So the next guess is ""CAROL"".

But wait, what if the secret word is ""CAROB""? Then we get:

- C: ✓
- A: ✓
- R: ✓
- O: ✓ (position 4 is O, which we know must be there)
- L: ? -> if the secret word is ""CAROB"", then L is not in the word, so we get x.

Then we would know the fifth letter is not L, and we can try ""CAROB"" next.

Similarly, if we guess ""CAROB"" and it's wrong, we get feedback on B.

But to save a guess, we might get lucky.

I think I'll go with ""CAROL"".

So:

<guess>carol</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.
  - N and E are absent.

- **Guess 2: cards** → C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) S(x)  
  - Confirms positions 1, 2, and 3 as C, A, R (forming ""CAR"").
  - D and S are absent.

- **Guess 3: cargo** → C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) G(x) O(-)  
  - Confirms ""CAR"" in positions 1–3.
  - G is absent.
  - O is in the word but not in position 5.

### Analysis:
- The secret word starts with ""CAR"" (positions 1–3 fixed).
- O must be in position 4 (since it's in the word but not position 5, and positions 1–3 are filled).
- Absent letters: N, E, D, S, G (cannot appear in the word).
- The word is now ""CARO?"" (only position 5 is unknown).
- Possible words: CAROB, CAROL, CAROM, etc. (common English words fitting ""CARO*"" and excluding absent letters).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test ""CAROL"" to check if L is the final letter, as it's a common word.
- If incorrect, feedback on L will confirm if it's present or absent, narrowing options (e.g., CAROB if L is absent).

<guess>carol</guess>",carol,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (position 1 correct)
- R: - (in word, but not position 2)
- A: - (in word, but not position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""cards""
- C: ✓ (position 1 correct)
- A: ✓ (position 2 correct)
- R: ✓ (position 3 correct)
- D: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""cargo""
- C: ✓ (position 1 correct)
- A: ✓ (position 2 correct)
- R: ✓ (position 3 correct)
- G: x (not in word)
- O: - (in word, but not position 5)

Now, we know:
- The secret word starts with ""CAR"" (positions 1,2,3 are C, A, R).
- The secret word contains the letter O, but not in position 5 (from the feedback of ""cargo"").
- The secret word does not contain: N, E, D, S, G (from the x's in all guesses).

Additionally, from the first guess, we know that A was not in position 3 (but now we have it in position 2, which is correct) and R was not in position 2 (but now in position 3, correct). So that is consistent.

Now, the secret word is ""CAR"" followed by two more letters. We know the fourth and fifth letters are not D, S, G, and also not N or E. Moreover, the word contains an O, but not in position 5.

Since the O is in the word but not in position 5, and the only positions left are 4 and 5 (but not 5 for O), then O must be in position 4.

Why? Because the word has only five positions. We have positions 1,2,3 fixed as C,A,R. So positions 4 and 5 are unknown. The O cannot be in position 5 (from the feedback of ""cargo"": O in position 5 is marked as '-', meaning it is in the word but not in that position). Therefore, O must be in position 4.

But wait, what if the word has two O's? Then O could be in position 4 and also in position 5? But we don't know. However, the feedback for ""cargo"" only shows one O (in position 5) and it is marked as '-', meaning there is at least one O and it's not in position 5. It doesn't tell us if there is a second O.

But if there is a second O, it could be in position 4? Or if there is only one O, it must be in position 4.

So the secret word must have O in position 4? Not necessarily, because if there is only one O, then it must be in position 4. But if there are two O's, then one could be in position 4 and the other in position 5? But we have a problem: in ""cargo"", we put O in position 5 and got a dash, meaning that there is an O in the word that is not in position 5. That O could be in position 4. But if there is an O in position 5 as well, then we would have two O's. However, the feedback for the O in position 5 would still be a dash? No, if the secret word has an O in position 5, then we would get a check for that position. But we got a dash, so the secret word does not have an O in position 5. Therefore, the secret word has at least one O, but not in position 5. So the O must be in position 4? Because that's the only position left? Not exactly: the O could be in a position we already have? But positions 1,2,3 are fixed and are C,A,R. None of them is O. So the only possibility for O is position 4.

Therefore, the secret word must have O in position 4.

So the word is ""CARO?"".

Now, we need to find the fifth letter. The fifth letter must be a letter that is not N, E, D, S, G, and it must form a valid English word.

Also, note that the word must be 5 letters.

So we are looking for words of the form ""CARO*"", where * is a letter not in {N, E, D, S, G}.

Possible words:

- CAROL: but L is not excluded? But wait, we haven't excluded L. However, let's check: if the fifth letter is L, then ""CAROL"". But we have to see if it meets the feedback.

But we have feedback that O is in the word and not in position 5. In ""CAROL"", O is in position 4, so that matches. The fifth letter is L.

But is L excluded? No, we haven't guessed L and it hasn't been marked as absent.

Similarly, other possibilities:

- CAROM: M is not excluded.
- CAROB: B is not excluded.
- CAROT: T is not excluded? But ""CAROT"" is not a common word; usually ""carrot"" has two R's? But ""carot"" is not a word. ""Carrot"" is 6 letters? No, ""carrot"" is 6 letters? C-A-R-R-O-T, that's 6. So not.

- CAROW: not a word.

- CAROP: not common.

- CAROA: not a word.

Common words: CAROL, CAROM, CAROB.

But CAROB: C A R O B -> that's a word (a type of bean).

CAROM: C A R O M -> a billiards term.

CAROL: C A R O L -> a song or a name.

Now, we have to choose one. But note: we also have the feedback from the first guess. In the first guess, we had ""crane"", and we know that A was in the word but not in position 3. That is satisfied because now A is in position 2.

Similarly, R was in the word but not in position 2, now in position 3.

Now, for the fifth letter, we need to find which one is the correct one.

We can try ""CAROL"" because it's common.

But let me see: we have not excluded any of B, L, M, etc.

We can also consider the possibility of duplicate letters? But in this case, we don't have any duplicate so far.

But note: in the secret word, we have O in position 4, and the fifth letter is unknown.

We can try to guess ""CAROL"" and see.

But we have one more thing: in the feedback for ""cargo"", we have O marked as dash for position 5, which is consistent with the secret word having O in position 4 and not 5.

Now, if we guess ""CAROL"", then:

- If the secret word is ""CAROL"", we win.

- If not, we get feedback on L.

Similarly, if we guess ""CAROB"", we test B.

But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can think: are there any other constraints?

We know that the secret word must have been in the Wordle word list.

I think ""CAROL"" is a very common word, so I'll try that.

But let me check: we have excluded letters: N, E, D, S, G.

We haven't tried: B, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc.

But for ""CARO*"", the common endings are L, B, M.

We can try ""CAROL"".

So the next guess is ""CAROL"".

But wait, what if the secret word is ""CAROB""? Then we get:

- C: ✓
- A: ✓
- R: ✓
- O: ✓ (position 4 is O, which we know must be there)
- L: ? -> if the secret word is ""CAROB"", then L is not in the word, so we get x.

Then we would know the fifth letter is not L, and we can try ""CAROB"" next.

Similarly, if we guess ""CAROB"" and it's wrong, we get feedback on B.

But to save a guess, we might get lucky.

I think I'll go with ""CAROL"".

So:

<guess>carol</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.
  - N and E are absent.

- **Guess 2: cards** → C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(x) S(x)  
  - Confirms positions 1, 2, and 3 as C, A, R (forming ""CAR"").
  - D and S are absent.

- **Guess 3: cargo** → C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) G(x) O(-)  
  - Confirms ""CAR"" in positions 1–3.
  - G is absent.
  - O is in the word but not in position 5.

### Analysis:
- The secret word starts with ""CAR"" (positions 1–3 fixed).
- O must be in position 4 (since it's in the word but not position 5, and positions 1–3 are filled).
- Absent letters: N, E, D, S, G (cannot appear in the word).
- The word is now ""CARO?"" (only position 5 is unknown).
- Possible words: CAROB, CAROL, CAROM, etc. (common English words fitting ""CARO*"" and excluding absent letters).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test ""CAROL"" to check if L is the final letter, as it's a common word.
- If incorrect, feedback on L will confirm if it's present or absent, narrowing options (e.g., CAROB if L is absent).",Guess 4: carol -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) O(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
