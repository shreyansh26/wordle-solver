 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)

This means:
- E is in the secret word and is in the correct position. Since E is the last letter, the secret word ends with E.
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Since E is at the end, the secret word is _ _ _ _ E.

We know that the letters C, R, A, N are absent. Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in the next guess.

Our next guess should:
1. End with E (to confirm or get more information about the position of E).
2. Use new letters that we haven't tried yet to maximize information.

We also know that E is the only correct letter so far, and it's at the end.

We should try to use common letters that haven't been eliminated. Common consonants that we haven't tried: T, L, S, D, M, P, etc., and vowels: O, I, U (since A is out).

We must guess a valid 5-letter word ending with E.

Let's think of words ending with E that do not contain C, R, A, N.

Some options:
- types of words: like ""slate"" (but A is eliminated, so we can't use A)
- We cannot use A.

Common words ending with E:
Examples: ""house"", ""table"" (but we can't use A) ... no, A is out.

With no A and no R, N, C.

How about ""style""? Let's check: S, T, Y, L, E. 
- S, T, Y, L, E: none of these are in the eliminated list (C,R,A,N are eliminated). And we have E at the end.

Another option: ""shine"" -> S,H,I,N,E. But N is eliminated (from previous feedback: N(x)), so we cannot use N. Therefore ""shine"" is invalid because it has N.

""slide"": S,L,I,D,E -> letters S,L,I,D,E. None of S,L,I,D,E are eliminated? Eliminated are C,R,A,N. So S,L,I,D,E are all allowed.

But wait, E is already known to be at the end. So we might put E at the end and try other positions.

We should avoid using E in positions other than the last? Actually, no — the feedback doesn't say E is only at the end; it only says that at position 5 it is correct. There could be another E? But typically, words can have repeated letters, but in this case, since E is correct at the end, we don't know about other Es.

But in Wordle, sometimes there are double letters. However, to keep it simple, let's assume we avoid using E elsewhere for now to avoid confusion.

But we can use E in other positions? Actually, we can, because it might reveal if there is another E? However, the feedback will show x for letters not present and - for present in wrong position.

Given we have limited guesses, we should try to use new letters.

Possible words ending in E, without C,R,A,N:
- ""style"": S,T,Y,L,E -> T is new, Y is new, L is new. Position: S at 1, T at 2, Y at 3, L at 4, E at 5.
- ""smile"": S,M,I,L,E -> M and I are new.
- ""spite"": S,P,I,T,E -> P and T are new.
- ""slide"": S,L,I,D,E -> D is new.

But also, we have vowels: we know A is out, so we can use O, U, I.

I think a good choice would be a word that uses as many new common letters as possible.

Let's list common letters we haven't tried: letters we haven't tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But we avoided C,R,A,N.

Specifically, common consonants: T, L, S, D, M, P, etc.

So, I like ""slide"": 
  S at position 1, L at 2, I at 3, D at 4, E at 5.
But we don't know if E appears multiple times? We are using E at the end, which is correct, so if there is another E, we might get a '-' for the second E? But currently, we are not placing E anywhere else.

In ""slide"", E is only at the end. So we are safe.

Similarly, ""style"" uses E only at the end.

But we also need to consider that the secret word has only E as a known letter, and at the 5th position.

Another word: ""blessed""? Too long. 5 letters? Then no.

5-letter words ending with E, without C,R,A,N.

Word list: let me think...
- ""quite"": Q,U,I,T,E -> Q is uncommon but valid.
- ""spite"": S,P,I,T,E -> good letters.
- ""stole"": S,T,O,L,E -> O is a vowel.

I think ""spite"" or ""stole"" or ""slide"".

But in the feedback, we got all x except for E. So the word does not have C,R,A,N, and only has E at the last position.

We need to cover more ground.

Perhaps ""sight""? but ends with T, not E.

We need it to end with E: so ""shift""? But no, we need E.

Okay, let me choose ""smile"": S,M,I,L,E.

Or ""stole"": S,T,O,L,E.

I'll go with ""stole"": because it has O, which is a common vowel, and T, L, S which are common consonants.

We have to avoid C,R,A,N.

So, ""stole"": S in position 1, T in 2, O in 3, L in 4, E in 5.

Now, if the secret word has E in the end, we can see if any of S,T,O,L are in the word.

But note: it's possible that the secret word has E only at the end and not elsewhere? Yes.

Also, we suspect that E is at the last position.

Hence, I'll guess: ""stole""

But let me confirm: S, T, O, L, E — none are C,R,A,N. Good.

Another word: ""spoke"" — S,P,O,K,E. K is another consonant.

I think ""stole"" is good.

So, next guess: ""stole""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th).  
- C, R, A, and N are completely absent.  

The secret word must be of the form _ _ _ _ E, using only letters not yet eliminated (excluding C, R, A, N). For the next guess:  
- Prioritize words ending in E to validate the known position.  
- Include common unused letters to maximize new information (e.g., consonants like S, T, L, D, M, P or vowels like O, I, U).  
- Avoid repeating eliminated letters and reuse E cautiously, but it may appear elsewhere.  

A strong candidate is **""stole""** because:  
- Ends in E (position 5), confirming the known letter.  
- Uses new common letters: S, T, O, L (none eliminated).  
- Covers a vowel (O) and frequent consonants.  

This guess will test for the presence of S, T, O, L and reconfirm E.

But let me confirm: S, T, O, L, E — none are C,R,A,N. Good.

Another word: ""spoke"" — S,P,O,K,E. K is another consonant.

I think ""stole"" is good.

So, next guess: ""stole""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th).  
- C, R, A, and N are completely absent.  

The secret word must be of the form _ _ _ _ E, using only letters not yet eliminated (excluding C, R, A, N). For the next guess:  
- Prioritize words ending in E to validate the known position.  
- Include common unused letters to maximize new information (e.g., consonants like S, T, L, D, M, P or vowels like O, I, U).  
- Avoid repeating eliminated letters and reuse E cautiously, but it may appear elsewhere.  

A strong candidate is **""stole""** because:  
- Ends in E (position 5), confirming the known letter.  
- Uses new common letters: S, T, O, L (none eliminated).  
- Covers a vowel (O) and frequent consonants.  

This guess will test for the presence of S, T, O, L and reconfirm E.

So we might put E at the end and try other positions.\n\nWe should avoid using E in positions other than the last? Actually, no — the feedback doesn\'t say E is only at the end; it only says that at position 5 it is correct. There could be another E? But typically, words can have repeated letters, but in this case, since E is correct at the end, we don\'t know about other Es.\n\nBut in Wordle, sometimes there are double letters.

We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th). Letters C, R, A, N are absent.
2. ""stole"": S(x) T(-) O(x) L(✓) E(✓) → 
   - S and O are absent.
   - T is present but not in the 2nd position.
   - L is in the correct position (4th? Let's check: in ""stole"", L is the 4th letter? Position: 1-S, 2-T, 3-O, 4-L, 5-E. So L is at 4 and correct). 
   - E is correct at position 5.

So, from feedback:
- Correct letters and positions: E at position 5, L at position 4.
- Present letters but wrong position: T (not at position 2).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must be of the form ? ? ? L E
- Must contain T, but not at position 2.
- Must not contain C, R, A, N, S, O.

Letters we know: present letters: T, L, E. But L and E have known positions: 4 and 5.

So the word is: _ _ T L E? Not necessarily T at position 3, because T is somewhere else but not position 2? T was in position 2 in ""stole"" but got (-), meaning it's in the word but not at that position. So T must be at position 1 or 3? Because position 4 and 5 are L and E.

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4=L, 5=E.

T was guessed at position 2, so it cannot be position 2. It could be position 1 or 3? Or maybe position 3? Wait, positions: 1, 3, or maybe 4? But position 4 is L, so T cannot be 4 because L is there. Similarly, position 5 is E. So T can only be at position 1 or 3.

Therefore, the word must have:
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: E
- T either at position 1 or position 3.
- And one more letter at the remaining position (if T is at 1, then positions 2 and 3 are for other letters; if T is at 3, then positions 1 and 2 for other letters).

But we also know that the word has exactly one T? Not necessarily, it might have more, but we don't know.

Absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,O are all absent. So we avoid any word with those letters.

Possible letters: we have used: C,R,A,N,E (in crane), and then S,T,O,L in stole. So absent: C,R,A,N,S,O. Therefore, available letters: all others: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

The word is: ? ? ? L E, with T in either position 1 or 3, and the remaining positions being some letters from available set.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Case 1: T at position 1.
Then word: T ? ? L E
Position 2 and 3 must be filled with letters not in {C,R,A,N,S,O} and not T? (could be T? but we don't know if repeated letters are allowed). But since we got T only once in feedback? Actually, feedback might show T once even if repeated, but no information. We should avoid if not necessary.

But for now, assume no duplicates if not forced.

So: T [pos2] [pos3] L E

Case 2: T at position 3.
Then word: ? ? T L E
Position 1 and 2 must be filled with available letters.

Also, note: from ""stole"", we had T at position 2 which got '-', meaning the word has T elsewhere. Also, in ""crane"", we didn't have T, but then we got it in ""stole"".

We need to make a guess that uses these constraints.

We need a word that:
- Ends with L E (positions 4 and 5: L and E)
- Has a T in it (at either position 1 or 3)
- Uses available letters (excluding C,R,A,N,S,O)

Let's think of common words ending in LE? But the word ends with LE? Not necessarily: it ends with LE only if positions 4 and 5 are L and E, so the last two letters are LE? Yes, it ends with ""LE"".

But actually, position 4 is L and position 5 is E, so the word ends with LE? Yes, because position 5 is E so the last letter is E, and second last is L? No: position 4 is L (second last), position 5 is E (last). So the word ends with ""LE"". For example: ""table"" ends in LE? T-A-B-L-E -> positions: T at1, A at2, B at3, L at4, E at5. So ending with ""LE"" actually? The string would be ? L E, but when we read the word, the last two characters are ""LE""? In terms of spelling, yes, but ""LE"" is not a separate unit.

The word must have second-to-last letter L and last letter E.

We can think of words that have the form ____LE.

But also they contain a T in position 1 or 3.

Possible words:

If T at position 1: T _ _ L E
Then a word like ""title"": but T-I-T-L-E -> position1 T, position2 I, position3 T, position4 L, position5 E. But then we have T at pos1 and pos3? But we have only one T? We got feedback for ""stole"": only one T marked? Actually, we had one T at position2 which got '-', meaning at least one T is present, but there could be more? Let me see the feedback: ""T(-)"" meaning that there is a T in the word but not at position2. So it could be one or more.

But let's check for duplicates: if we use T at position1, then position3 could be anything? But we have to avoid absent letters.

Word ""title"" has T at1 and T at3? But we don't know if the secret word has two Ts? And also, we have S absent? ""title"" has I and L,E, and T.

Letters: T, I, T, L, E -> T and T are same. But we used T once? In feedback, we saw that T was present? We did not get information about the count? Actually, if there were two Ts, in ""stole"", we only had one T guessed? So if the secret word had two Ts, and one of them was not guessed? But we guessed T only at position2? Then for the second T, if it were present, it might have been caught? No, because we didn't guess T elsewhere.

In ""stole"", the T was at position2, and we got '-', meaning there is a T in the word but not at pos2. It does not indicate if there are other Ts. So we must consider possibility of multiple Ts? But for now, let's avoid if not necessary? Since we have limited guesses, we can try to resolve the position of T with our next guess.

But we need to come up with a guess. Our next guess should be a word with L at position4 and E at position5? We don't have to; we can guess a word that might not have L E at the end? But we know L and E are at positions 4 and 5? Actually, we know that from feedback? For positions: in ""stole"", L was at position4 and got marked ✓, meaning L is in the correct position (4). Similarly, E at position5 ✓. So we know the secret word has L at position4 and E at position5. So the ending is fixed: positions 4 and 5 - L and E.

Therefore, we must have in our next guess: at position4: L, and position5: E? We don't have to, but if we change them, we might waste information? Because we know they are correct, it would be inefficient to move them.

Usually, we keep the known letters in their positions.

So our guess should have L at position4, E at position5.

Then, position1,2,3: we need to use letters not absent, and we need to put T only if we want to test? But we know T is in the word? Actually, we know T is present? But we don't know the position? It must be at position1 or3.

So we need to try to find what letters go in positions 1,2,3.

For position2, we know T is not there? T is not at position2? But we don't know about other letters.

We should use a word that has:

Position1: a letter we want to test
Position2: a letter we want to test
Position3: either T (if we think T is there) or another letter

But we need to distinguish: is T at position1 or position3?

If we put T at position1 in our guess, then:
- If T is actually at position1: then we get ✓ for T
- If not (i.e., T is at position3): then we get '-' for T? Since T is in the word but at wrong position.

Similarly, if we put T at position3:
- If T is at position3: ✓
- If T is at position1: '-' 

We also have position2? We must put something at position2. We should put a letter that hasn't been used? Since S,O are absent? We have absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,O.

So we can use: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and T).

So let's form a word with positions 1,2,3: we want to test T's position and other letters.

Let us assume we put T at position1 in our next guess? Then positions: T at1, ? at2, ? at3, L at4, E at5.

And we want a valid word? For example, ""tulle"" but has two L's? Or ""title"" (but we used T twice?).

Word ""title"": T I T L E -> positions: T(1), I(2), T(3), L(4), E(5). But we can do that? Then the second T at position3? But if we put T at position3, we don't know if the secret word has one T or two? Also, we used T twice? Same letter can be used multiple times? For example, ""title"" has two Ts.

But is that valid? Yes, words can have repeated letters.

But in our case, we don't know if secret word has multiple Ts? So ""title"" would test if the secret word has T at1 and T at3? But from feedback, we only know one T present? From ""stole"" we only know one T exists? But possible more.

To test if T is at position1, put T at1 and see if it gets ✓.

If we put T at position1 and it gets ✓, then position1 is T? And position3 must be something else? Or if we put T at1 and it gets '-', then T is at position3? And avoid position1.

Similarly, for position. But also, we have position2.

We could put in position3 a different letter? Then if we put T at1 and it gets ✓, then T is at1? If it gets '-', then T must be at position3? Because we know T is in the word and positions are limited: only 1 or 3? Position2 is not available? Because we know T is not at2.

So if we guess:

Option A: Guess T at position1: then we might be able to pin T.

Similarly, we need to choose position2 and position3: we should choose common letters not tested yet.

For example: available vowels: I,U (we haven't used I,U? We used A,O,E? E is used? O is absent? A is absent? So vowels: I,U? And consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J... etc.

Let's choose a word like ""tile"" but with an extra letter? It has to be 5 letters? ""tile"" is 4? Five letter word T _ _ L E.

Ex: ""tuile"" is a word? Tuile is a thin cookie, and that is accepted? Or ""tulle"" which is netting? Or ""title""?

But let me think of good words:

""tuile"": T U I L E -> positions: T, U, I, L, E? But L is at position4? Position1:T,2:U,3:I,4:L,5:E.

Yes.

""title"": T I T L E -> positions:1:T,2:I,3:T,4:L,5:E.

""tulle"": T U L L E -> positions:1:T,2:U,3:L,4:L,5:E. That has two Ls? And L at position3? But we know L is at position4? So if we put L at position3, that might be a problem? Position4 is also L? So if the secret word has only one L, then L at position3 might be a wrong letter? But we know that position4 is L? So in ""tuile"" or ""title""?

We can use ""tizzy""? But ends with Y? Not E.

Must end with E.

So words: ""title"", ""tuile"", ""timer""? But ""timer"" ends with R? Not LE? No, must have L at4 and E at5? So the last two letters must be L E? So possible words: ""bible"", ""idle"", etc., but with T at1? or T at3.

With T at1: ""table"" but A is absent (from crane feedback). So ""table"" has A? Invalid.

""tripe"" but O is absent? Not LE? Not ending with LE.

We have to have position4:L, position5:E.

So the word must be in the form X Y Z L E? with T either X or Z.

Available letters? And avoid S,O,C,R,A,N.

With T at position1: T Y Z L E

Then Y and Z? Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common ones: H,I,M,P,U etc.

Possible words:
- ""title"" -> T-I-T-L-E -> but has T at3? Uses T twice? And I is at2. Note: T at1 and T at3.
- ""tulle"" -> T-U-L-L-E -> position3: L? But we know that L is at position4? And position3 we are putting L? But L might be present only once? We don't know: from feedback, we have one L at position4. There could be another? But if we put L at position3, and secret has only one L (at4), we put L at3 then it would be shown as '-' only if there is another position? Actually, in Wordle, if there is only one L and you put L at wrong position, it shows '-', but if you put L at another position? But if secret has one L and you put two? Then one might show ✓ and one '-'? It depends.

But that could be messy? We can avoid using L elsewhere.

Similarly, avoid using E elsewhere? Because E is at position5? Secret might have other E, but we don't know? But we haven't seen any? In crane, we had E at5 ✓, and no other E? Since we guessed only position5? In stole, we guessed E at5 ✓, so no other E tested? So if secret word has another E, we might have missed? But position5 E is fixed.

Better to avoid? Use no E except position5? Or we can use? But less confusing.

So for T Y Z L E: let Y and Z be vowels or consonants: possible words:

""title"" -> T-I-T-L-E: uses T twice? But if secret has two Ts, it would be fine? Or if one? But we don't know.

""tuile"" -> T-U-I-L-E: good? Yes, word ""tuile"" is valid? But maybe not common? Should I choose common words? Assume it's valid.

""tulle"": T-U-L-L-E: has L at position3? Which is the same letter? Might not be great? Avoid.

Another word: ""tizze""? Not a word? Probably not.

So candidate words: ""title"" and ""tuile"".

If we put T at position3: Then word: ? ? T L E

Position1 and position2.

For example: ""butle""? Not a standard word? ""beetle"" but has two E and E at position2? Ends with LE? But if we put T at position3: for example, ""motle""? Not word. ""ditle""? Not word.

Words like ""lotte"", but ends with E? L-O-T-T-E? But ends with E? Not LE? Positions: let see: position3:T, position4:L? Not necessarily? For a word like ""battle"", but ends with LE: B-A-T-T-L-E which is 6 letters? Not 5.

5-letter words ending with LE containing T at position3:

""Little""? L-I-T-T-L-E? That is 6 letters? No, ""little"" is 6: L-I-T-T-L-E.

5-letter: ""cattle""? C-A-T-T-L-E -> but C and A? Absent? Already out.

""kettle"": K-E-T-T-L-E -> K at1, E at2? But we know position5:E? And E at2? Also, avoid C,R,A,N,S,O? This has E at2? And T at3 and T? And L at4.

But we have used E? And K? So: could be? Word ""kettle"".

But if we put E at position2? It might be present? Because we know only position5 E? There could be other E? We haven't eliminated E elsewhere.

Similarly, ""mettle"": M-E-T-T-L-E -> E at2? Then we lose position? But we have to have L at4 and E at5? Yes.

But ""kettle"" or ""mettle"" have T at position3? Position: ""kettle"" -> K at1, E at2, T at3, T at4? No: spelling: K-E-T-T-L-E? That is 6 letters? K-E-T-T-L-E? K-E-T-T-L-E is 6 positions? Oh, mistake.

Standard spelling: ""kettle"" is K-E-T-T-L-E? Not? No, ""kettle"" is K-E-T-T-L-E? Actually, no: 
K-E-T-T-L-E -> 6 letters? Yes, 6? But Word is 5-letter? I think ""kettle"" has double T? But let me count: K E T T L E -> that's 6 characters? But dictionary: kettle is spelled with 6: K-E-T-T-L-E? But it's sometimes listed as 6. 

Five letter words ending with LE that have T at position3:

""metal""? But ends with AL? Not LE.

""total""? Ends with AL? Not LE.

Actually, 5-letter words ending in LE are not common? Common ones: ""apple"", ""ample"", ""beetle"", ""eagle"", etc., but not ending in T? Position3 T.

Example: ""bottle"", ""battle"", ""cattle"", ""kittle"", ""mettle"", ""nettle"", etc., but they are 6 letters? No, ""bottle"" is B-O-T-T-L-E? That is 6? No: B-O-T-T-L-E? B-O-T-T-L-E has positions: 1:B,2:O,3:T,4:T,5:L,6:E? So it's 6 letters? That can't be in a 5-letter Wordle.

I think I have a confusion: in Wordle, all words are exactly 5 letters? So let me think of 5-letter words exactly.

Five-letter words ending with LE: e.g. ""idle"", ""eagle"", ""bugle"", ""noble"", ""sable"", ""table"", ""bible"", ""title"", ""rifle"", ""cycle"", etc.

But ""cycle"" has C? Absent? ""table"" has A? Absent? ""noble"" has O? Absent? ""idle"": I-D-L-E? I at1, D at2, L at3, E at4? Not LE at end? Position: for ""idle"": positions:1:I,2:D,3:L,4:E? That would be 4-letter? No, wait: ""idle"" is 4 letters? Oh, big mistake.

""Idle"" is I-D-L-E: 4 letters? Then 5-letter words: e.g. ""bevel"", ""travel"", ""gravel"", ""swell"", etc.? But not ending with LE? The suffix LE does not mean it must be L then E? In Spelling, many words end with _ _ _ L E, so position4 L, position5 E? Yes.

Examples: ""apple"" - A-P-P-L-E? 5 letters? Yes? Positions: 1:A,2:P,3:P,4:L,5:E -> ends with LE? Yes.

""maple"": M-A-P-L-E -> 1:M,2:A,3:P,4:L,5:E.

But A is absent? So no.

""eagle"": E-A-G-L-E -> has A? Absent? ""bugle"": B-U-G-L-E -> no A or C? B,U,G,L,E -> avoid C,R,A,N,S,O? U is available? G is available.

Similarly, ""title"": T-I-T-L-E -> available letters? T,I,T,L,E. But T repeated? And we used T? Available? Yes, if not absent? But T at position3?

Back to our constraint: T must be at position1 or3? If we choose a word with T at position3? For example: ""title"" has T at position3? Also at1? Let's see: T at1, I at2, T at3 -> so T at3.

Or ""bezel"": B-E-Z-E-L-E? Not? ""bezel"" is B-E-Z-E-L? Ends with EL? Not LE? So L is at5? Position4 E? Not.

Words to have position4:L, position5:E? So character positions: letter4 must be L, letter5 must be E? Yes.

So word: ? ? ? L E.

For T to be at position3: word: ? ? T L E.

Example: ""beetle"" has two E, but it is 6 letters? ""little"" 6 letters.

Must be 5-letter? Possible words: ""cable"", ""fable"", ""gable"", but have A? Absent? ""noble"" has O? Absent? ""maple"" has A? Absent? ""eagle"" has A? Absent? ""bugle"": B-U-G-L-E -> positions:1:B,2:U,3:G,4:L,5:E -> this has T at position3? G is at3, not T? We need T at position3? So ""bugle"" has G at3.

Similarly, ""title"": T-I-T-L-E -> positions:1:T,2:I,3:T,4:L,5:E -> so position3 is T? Yes? Position3 is T? And position1 is T? But position3 is T.

So yes, ""title"" has T at position3? And also at1? But we don't care about position1? We need to see whether we want to test it.

Another word: ""whittle"" too long? ""tulle"" is T-U-L-L-E -> 5 letters: T,U,L,L,E? So positions:1:T,2:U,3:L,4:L,5:E -> position3 is L? But we know L is at position4? So having L at position3 might be an issue? But if secret has L only at position4, then an L at position3 will get 'x' if only one L? But if secret has two L, then it could be '-'.

But let's not introduce new letter issues.

Back to guessing: let's choose ""title"" as our next guess? That might work? But we have T at1 and T at3? That tests both possible T positions? Let's see.

If secret word has T at position1 but not at3: then in ""title"":

- T at1: correct? Or if T is at1, then ✓
- T at3: if not present at3? Or if only one T and it's at1, then T at3 would be x? But we put T at3, and it is not present? But secret has only one T at position1? Then for T at3 we get x? But we also have T at1 ✓.

The feedback: position at1 T: if secret has T at1, ✓? yes.

Position at3 T: if secret has no T at3? And only one T at1, then it would be 'x'? Because no T at position3? And not elsewhere? But secret has T? How many? If only one, then T at position3 not present.

But feedback doesn't tell count? It only shows per letter? So for T at1: if correct position ✓? For T at3: if the secret has only one T and it's at1, then T at3 is not present: 'x'.

On the other hand, if secret has T at3 but not at1? Then T at1: '-', T at3: '✓'.

If secret has T at both? Then T at1: '-', T at3: '✓'? Or if positions correct? But position3 would be ✓.

Case:
- Secret word has T at1 (position) and no other T? Then our guess ""title"": T(1):✓ (correct position), T(3):x? Because secret has only one T and it's at1, so position3 T wrong and no extra T? So x? Then position2 I: ? etc.

If secret has T at3 only? Then T at1 in guess: not correct position? Sincell the T is at3? But we also put T at3? So T at1: '-' (because T present but not at1), T at3: ✓.

If secret has no T? But we know from previous feedback that T is present? From ""stole"" feedback T(-) means T is in the secret word? So it must be present.

So guessing ""title"" can help us distinguish:

- If T is at position1: then our guess T at1 will be ✓, and T at3 may be x or - depending? But it might tell us.

Also, by using ""title"", we are testing I at position2? And  or not? I is a new letter.

But ""title"" has I at position2? Which is a new letter.

So, it seems good.

Another option: put T at position1 only? For example, ""tulle""?: T U L L E - but L at position3? And L at position4? Which we know position4 is L? So position3 L might conflict the L at position4.

Not good? Avoid.

""tizzy"" not ends with E.

So I think ""title"" is a reasonable guess.

But let me think of words like ""tuple"": T U P L E -> positions: T at1, U at2, P at3, L at4, E at5. But then T at1 only? Not at3? So it doesn't test position3? Also P is at3.

If we use ""tuple"", then:

- T at1: if secret has T at1, ✓; if secret has T at3, '-'

- Then position2 U and position3 P provide new information.

It also doesn't have repeated T.

Similarly, ""twice""? Not ends with E.

""tube""  4 letters.

""true"" 4.

So ""tuple"" is good? Is ""tuple"" a word? Tuple is valid in computing, but in English, it might be accepted? Assume it's valid.

Other words: ""tubal"" not ends with E.

""tired"" not LE.

So ""tuple"" or ""title""? ""title"" might be better? To cover both T positions.

But ""title"" uses T twice? But if secret has no T at position3? We might waste? But it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has T at position1, and position3 a different letter? For example, ""tuple"": T U P L E -> so position3: P.

Then:

- T at1: if ✓, then secret has T at1; if '-', then T at position3.
- We learn about U at position2 and P at position3.

Whereas, in ""title"", we learn about I at position2? Both T positions tested? But we don't know which T is matched? It's messy.

So perhaps ""tuple"" is cleaner.

Then I choose ""tuple"".

Confidence:   ""tuple"": T U P L E

Avoids: C,R,A,N,S,O? T, U, P, L, E -> letters: T,U,P,L,E -> L and E we know, T,U,P new? P is not absent? Yes.

We are testing: position1 T, position2 U, position3 P.

For the secret word: we must have L at4, E at5? And T somewhere? Either position1 or3? Also, the word must be valid.

Now, based on feedback, we will know more.

So I'll guess ""tuple"".

But also, we know that from previous feedback, E is at5? But in ""tuple"", E at5 is correct? Yes, because position5 is E? And L at4? L at4? In ""tuple"", position4 is L? Yes? So L at position4 ✓? And E at5, so both fixed? Good.

Therefore: guess ""tuple"".

<guess>tuple</guess>
</think>
From the previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): E is confirmed at position 5, and C, R, A, N are absent.
- Guess 2 (""stole""): T is present but not at position 2, O and S are absent, L is confirmed at position 4, and E is confirmed at position 5.

Key deductions:
1. The secret word has L at position 4 and E at position 5, so it ends with ""LE"".
2. T is in the word but must be at position 1 or 3 (since it cannot be at position 2, and positions 4–5 are fixed).
3. Absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, O) must be avoided. Remaining letters are B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The next guess should:
- Keep L at position 4 and E at position 5 to leverage known correct positions.
- Test T at position 1 to distinguish whether it belongs there or at position 3.
- Use new common letters (U and P) for positions 2 and 3 to maximize information.

""tuple"" (a valid English word) fits these constraints:
- Positions: T (1), U (2), P (3), L (4), E (5).
- Tests:
  - If T gets ""✓"", it means T is at position 1.
  - If T gets ""-"", it means T is at position 3 (since position 2 is invalid).
  - U and P are tested for presence/position and aren't eliminated letters.

This guess efficiently probes the positions of T and expands coverage to new letters.

<guess>tuple</guess>",tuple,"We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th). Letters C, R, A, N are absent.
2. ""stole"": S(x) T(-) O(x) L(✓) E(✓) → 
   - S and O are absent.
   - T is present but not in the 2nd position.
   - L is in the correct position (4th? Let's check: in ""stole"", L is the 4th letter? Position: 1-S, 2-T, 3-O, 4-L, 5-E. So L is at 4 and correct). 
   - E is correct at position 5.

So, from feedback:
- Correct letters and positions: E at position 5, L at position 4.
- Present letters but wrong position: T (not at position 2).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must be of the form ? ? ? L E
- Must contain T, but not at position 2.
- Must not contain C, R, A, N, S, O.

Letters we know: present letters: T, L, E. But L and E have known positions: 4 and 5.

So the word is: _ _ T L E? Not necessarily T at position 3, because T is somewhere else but not position 2? T was in position 2 in ""stole"" but got (-), meaning it's in the word but not at that position. So T must be at position 1 or 3? Because position 4 and 5 are L and E.

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4=L, 5=E.

T was guessed at position 2, so it cannot be position 2. It could be position 1 or 3? Or maybe position 3? Wait, positions: 1, 3, or maybe 4? But position 4 is L, so T cannot be 4 because L is there. Similarly, position 5 is E. So T can only be at position 1 or 3.

Therefore, the word must have:
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: E
- T either at position 1 or position 3.
- And one more letter at the remaining position (if T is at 1, then positions 2 and 3 are for other letters; if T is at 3, then positions 1 and 2 for other letters).

But we also know that the word has exactly one T? Not necessarily, it might have more, but we don't know.

Absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,O are all absent. So we avoid any word with those letters.

Possible letters: we have used: C,R,A,N,E (in crane), and then S,T,O,L in stole. So absent: C,R,A,N,S,O. Therefore, available letters: all others: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

The word is: ? ? ? L E, with T in either position 1 or 3, and the remaining positions being some letters from available set.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Case 1: T at position 1.
Then word: T ? ? L E
Position 2 and 3 must be filled with letters not in {C,R,A,N,S,O} and not T? (could be T? but we don't know if repeated letters are allowed). But since we got T only once in feedback? Actually, feedback might show T once even if repeated, but no information. We should avoid if not necessary.

But for now, assume no duplicates if not forced.

So: T [pos2] [pos3] L E

Case 2: T at position 3.
Then word: ? ? T L E
Position 1 and 2 must be filled with available letters.

Also, note: from ""stole"", we had T at position 2 which got '-', meaning the word has T elsewhere. Also, in ""crane"", we didn't have T, but then we got it in ""stole"".

We need to make a guess that uses these constraints.

We need a word that:
- Ends with L E (positions 4 and 5: L and E)
- Has a T in it (at either position 1 or 3)
- Uses available letters (excluding C,R,A,N,S,O)

Let's think of common words ending in LE? But the word ends with LE? Not necessarily: it ends with LE only if positions 4 and 5 are L and E, so the last two letters are LE? Yes, it ends with ""LE"".

But actually, position 4 is L and position 5 is E, so the word ends with LE? Yes, because position 5 is E so the last letter is E, and second last is L? No: position 4 is L (second last), position 5 is E (last). So the word ends with ""LE"". For example: ""table"" ends in LE? T-A-B-L-E -> positions: T at1, A at2, B at3, L at4, E at5. So ending with ""LE"" actually? The string would be ? L E, but when we read the word, the last two characters are ""LE""? In terms of spelling, yes, but ""LE"" is not a separate unit.

The word must have second-to-last letter L and last letter E.

We can think of words that have the form ____LE.

But also they contain a T in position 1 or 3.

Possible words:

If T at position 1: T _ _ L E
Then a word like ""title"": but T-I-T-L-E -> position1 T, position2 I, position3 T, position4 L, position5 E. But then we have T at pos1 and pos3? But we have only one T? We got feedback for ""stole"": only one T marked? Actually, we had one T at position2 which got '-', meaning at least one T is present, but there could be more? Let me see the feedback: ""T(-)"" meaning that there is a T in the word but not at position2. So it could be one or more.

But let's check for duplicates: if we use T at position1, then position3 could be anything? But we have to avoid absent letters.

Word ""title"" has T at1 and T at3? But we don't know if the secret word has two Ts? And also, we have S absent? ""title"" has I and L,E, and T.

Letters: T, I, T, L, E -> T and T are same. But we used T once? In feedback, we saw that T was present? We did not get information about the count? Actually, if there were two Ts, in ""stole"", we only had one T guessed? So if the secret word had two Ts, and one of them was not guessed? But we guessed T only at position2? Then for the second T, if it were present, it might have been caught? No, because we didn't guess T elsewhere.

In ""stole"", the T was at position2, and we got '-', meaning there is a T in the word but not at pos2. It does not indicate if there are other Ts. So we must consider possibility of multiple Ts? But for now, let's avoid if not necessary? Since we have limited guesses, we can try to resolve the position of T with our next guess.

But we need to come up with a guess. Our next guess should be a word with L at position4 and E at position5? We don't have to; we can guess a word that might not have L E at the end? But we know L and E are at positions 4 and 5? Actually, we know that from feedback? For positions: in ""stole"", L was at position4 and got marked ✓, meaning L is in the correct position (4). Similarly, E at position5 ✓. So we know the secret word has L at position4 and E at position5. So the ending is fixed: positions 4 and 5 - L and E.

Therefore, we must have in our next guess: at position4: L, and position5: E? We don't have to, but if we change them, we might waste information? Because we know they are correct, it would be inefficient to move them.

Usually, we keep the known letters in their positions.

So our guess should have L at position4, E at position5.

Then, position1,2,3: we need to use letters not absent, and we need to put T only if we want to test? But we know T is in the word? Actually, we know T is present? But we don't know the position? It must be at position1 or3.

So we need to try to find what letters go in positions 1,2,3.

For position2, we know T is not there? T is not at position2? But we don't know about other letters.

We should use a word that has:

Position1: a letter we want to test
Position2: a letter we want to test
Position3: either T (if we think T is there) or another letter

But we need to distinguish: is T at position1 or position3?

If we put T at position1 in our guess, then:
- If T is actually at position1: then we get ✓ for T
- If not (i.e., T is at position3): then we get '-' for T? Since T is in the word but at wrong position.

Similarly, if we put T at position3:
- If T is at position3: ✓
- If T is at position1: '-' 

We also have position2? We must put something at position2. We should put a letter that hasn't been used? Since S,O are absent? We have absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,O.

So we can use: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and T).

So let's form a word with positions 1,2,3: we want to test T's position and other letters.

Let us assume we put T at position1 in our next guess? Then positions: T at1, ? at2, ? at3, L at4, E at5.

And we want a valid word? For example, ""tulle"" but has two L's? Or ""title"" (but we used T twice?).

Word ""title"": T I T L E -> positions: T(1), I(2), T(3), L(4), E(5). But we can do that? Then the second T at position3? But if we put T at position3, we don't know if the secret word has one T or two? Also, we used T twice? Same letter can be used multiple times? For example, ""title"" has two Ts.

But is that valid? Yes, words can have repeated letters.

But in our case, we don't know if secret word has multiple Ts? So ""title"" would test if the secret word has T at1 and T at3? But from feedback, we only know one T present? From ""stole"" we only know one T exists? But possible more.

To test if T is at position1, put T at1 and see if it gets ✓.

If we put T at position1 and it gets ✓, then position1 is T? And position3 must be something else? Or if we put T at1 and it gets '-', then T is at position3? And avoid position1.

Similarly, for position. But also, we have position2.

We could put in position3 a different letter? Then if we put T at1 and it gets ✓, then T is at1? If it gets '-', then T must be at position3? Because we know T is in the word and positions are limited: only 1 or 3? Position2 is not available? Because we know T is not at2.

So if we guess:

Option A: Guess T at position1: then we might be able to pin T.

Similarly, we need to choose position2 and position3: we should choose common letters not tested yet.

For example: available vowels: I,U (we haven't used I,U? We used A,O,E? E is used? O is absent? A is absent? So vowels: I,U? And consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J... etc.

Let's choose a word like ""tile"" but with an extra letter? It has to be 5 letters? ""tile"" is 4? Five letter word T _ _ L E.

Ex: ""tuile"" is a word? Tuile is a thin cookie, and that is accepted? Or ""tulle"" which is netting? Or ""title""?

But let me think of good words:

""tuile"": T U I L E -> positions: T, U, I, L, E? But L is at position4? Position1:T,2:U,3:I,4:L,5:E.

Yes.

""title"": T I T L E -> positions:1:T,2:I,3:T,4:L,5:E.

""tulle"": T U L L E -> positions:1:T,2:U,3:L,4:L,5:E. That has two Ls? And L at position3? But we know L is at position4? So if we put L at position3, that might be a problem? Position4 is also L? So if the secret word has only one L, then L at position3 might be a wrong letter? But we know that position4 is L? So in ""tuile"" or ""title""?

We can use ""tizzy""? But ends with Y? Not E.

Must end with E.

So words: ""title"", ""tuile"", ""timer""? But ""timer"" ends with R? Not LE? No, must have L at4 and E at5? So the last two letters must be L E? So possible words: ""bible"", ""idle"", etc., but with T at1? or T at3.

With T at1: ""table"" but A is absent (from crane feedback). So ""table"" has A? Invalid.

""tripe"" but O is absent? Not LE? Not ending with LE.

We have to have position4:L, position5:E.

So the word must be in the form X Y Z L E? with T either X or Z.

Available letters? And avoid S,O,C,R,A,N.

With T at position1: T Y Z L E

Then Y and Z? Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common ones: H,I,M,P,U etc.

Possible words:
- ""title"" -> T-I-T-L-E -> but has T at3? Uses T twice? And I is at2. Note: T at1 and T at3.
- ""tulle"" -> T-U-L-L-E -> position3: L? But we know that L is at position4? And position3 we are putting L? But L might be present only once? We don't know: from feedback, we have one L at position4. There could be another? But if we put L at position3, and secret has only one L (at4), we put L at3 then it would be shown as '-' only if there is another position? Actually, in Wordle, if there is only one L and you put L at wrong position, it shows '-', but if you put L at another position? But if secret has one L and you put two? Then one might show ✓ and one '-'? It depends.

But that could be messy? We can avoid using L elsewhere.

Similarly, avoid using E elsewhere? Because E is at position5? Secret might have other E, but we don't know? But we haven't seen any? In crane, we had E at5 ✓, and no other E? Since we guessed only position5? In stole, we guessed E at5 ✓, so no other E tested? So if secret word has another E, we might have missed? But position5 E is fixed.

Better to avoid? Use no E except position5? Or we can use? But less confusing.

So for T Y Z L E: let Y and Z be vowels or consonants: possible words:

""title"" -> T-I-T-L-E: uses T twice? But if secret has two Ts, it would be fine? Or if one? But we don't know.

""tuile"" -> T-U-I-L-E: good? Yes, word ""tuile"" is valid? But maybe not common? Should I choose common words? Assume it's valid.

""tulle"": T-U-L-L-E: has L at position3? Which is the same letter? Might not be great? Avoid.

Another word: ""tizze""? Not a word? Probably not.

So candidate words: ""title"" and ""tuile"".

If we put T at position3: Then word: ? ? T L E

Position1 and position2.

For example: ""butle""? Not a standard word? ""beetle"" but has two E and E at position2? Ends with LE? But if we put T at position3: for example, ""motle""? Not word. ""ditle""? Not word.

Words like ""lotte"", but ends with E? L-O-T-T-E? But ends with E? Not LE? Positions: let see: position3:T, position4:L? Not necessarily? For a word like ""battle"", but ends with LE: B-A-T-T-L-E which is 6 letters? Not 5.

5-letter words ending with LE containing T at position3:

""Little""? L-I-T-T-L-E? That is 6 letters? No, ""little"" is 6: L-I-T-T-L-E.

5-letter: ""cattle""? C-A-T-T-L-E -> but C and A? Absent? Already out.

""kettle"": K-E-T-T-L-E -> K at1, E at2? But we know position5:E? And E at2? Also, avoid C,R,A,N,S,O? This has E at2? And T at3 and T? And L at4.

But we have used E? And K? So: could be? Word ""kettle"".

But if we put E at position2? It might be present? Because we know only position5 E? There could be other E? We haven't eliminated E elsewhere.

Similarly, ""mettle"": M-E-T-T-L-E -> E at2? Then we lose position? But we have to have L at4 and E at5? Yes.

But ""kettle"" or ""mettle"" have T at position3? Position: ""kettle"" -> K at1, E at2, T at3, T at4? No: spelling: K-E-T-T-L-E? That is 6 letters? K-E-T-T-L-E? K-E-T-T-L-E is 6 positions? Oh, mistake.

Standard spelling: ""kettle"" is K-E-T-T-L-E? Not? No, ""kettle"" is K-E-T-T-L-E? Actually, no: 
K-E-T-T-L-E -> 6 letters? Yes, 6? But Word is 5-letter? I think ""kettle"" has double T? But let me count: K E T T L E -> that's 6 characters? But dictionary: kettle is spelled with 6: K-E-T-T-L-E? But it's sometimes listed as 6. 

Five letter words ending with LE that have T at position3:

""metal""? But ends with AL? Not LE.

""total""? Ends with AL? Not LE.

Actually, 5-letter words ending in LE are not common? Common ones: ""apple"", ""ample"", ""beetle"", ""eagle"", etc., but not ending in T? Position3 T.

Example: ""bottle"", ""battle"", ""cattle"", ""kittle"", ""mettle"", ""nettle"", etc., but they are 6 letters? No, ""bottle"" is B-O-T-T-L-E? That is 6? No: B-O-T-T-L-E? B-O-T-T-L-E has positions: 1:B,2:O,3:T,4:T,5:L,6:E? So it's 6 letters? That can't be in a 5-letter Wordle.

I think I have a confusion: in Wordle, all words are exactly 5 letters? So let me think of 5-letter words exactly.

Five-letter words ending with LE: e.g. ""idle"", ""eagle"", ""bugle"", ""noble"", ""sable"", ""table"", ""bible"", ""title"", ""rifle"", ""cycle"", etc.

But ""cycle"" has C? Absent? ""table"" has A? Absent? ""noble"" has O? Absent? ""idle"": I-D-L-E? I at1, D at2, L at3, E at4? Not LE at end? Position: for ""idle"": positions:1:I,2:D,3:L,4:E? That would be 4-letter? No, wait: ""idle"" is 4 letters? Oh, big mistake.

""Idle"" is I-D-L-E: 4 letters? Then 5-letter words: e.g. ""bevel"", ""travel"", ""gravel"", ""swell"", etc.? But not ending with LE? The suffix LE does not mean it must be L then E? In Spelling, many words end with _ _ _ L E, so position4 L, position5 E? Yes.

Examples: ""apple"" - A-P-P-L-E? 5 letters? Yes? Positions: 1:A,2:P,3:P,4:L,5:E -> ends with LE? Yes.

""maple"": M-A-P-L-E -> 1:M,2:A,3:P,4:L,5:E.

But A is absent? So no.

""eagle"": E-A-G-L-E -> has A? Absent? ""bugle"": B-U-G-L-E -> no A or C? B,U,G,L,E -> avoid C,R,A,N,S,O? U is available? G is available.

Similarly, ""title"": T-I-T-L-E -> available letters? T,I,T,L,E. But T repeated? And we used T? Available? Yes, if not absent? But T at position3?

Back to our constraint: T must be at position1 or3? If we choose a word with T at position3? For example: ""title"" has T at position3? Also at1? Let's see: T at1, I at2, T at3 -> so T at3.

Or ""bezel"": B-E-Z-E-L-E? Not? ""bezel"" is B-E-Z-E-L? Ends with EL? Not LE? So L is at5? Position4 E? Not.

Words to have position4:L, position5:E? So character positions: letter4 must be L, letter5 must be E? Yes.

So word: ? ? ? L E.

For T to be at position3: word: ? ? T L E.

Example: ""beetle"" has two E, but it is 6 letters? ""little"" 6 letters.

Must be 5-letter? Possible words: ""cable"", ""fable"", ""gable"", but have A? Absent? ""noble"" has O? Absent? ""maple"" has A? Absent? ""eagle"" has A? Absent? ""bugle"": B-U-G-L-E -> positions:1:B,2:U,3:G,4:L,5:E -> this has T at position3? G is at3, not T? We need T at position3? So ""bugle"" has G at3.

Similarly, ""title"": T-I-T-L-E -> positions:1:T,2:I,3:T,4:L,5:E -> so position3 is T? Yes? Position3 is T? And position1 is T? But position3 is T.

So yes, ""title"" has T at position3? And also at1? But we don't care about position1? We need to see whether we want to test it.

Another word: ""whittle"" too long? ""tulle"" is T-U-L-L-E -> 5 letters: T,U,L,L,E? So positions:1:T,2:U,3:L,4:L,5:E -> position3 is L? But we know L is at position4? So having L at position3 might be an issue? But if secret has L only at position4, then an L at position3 will get 'x' if only one L? But if secret has two L, then it could be '-'.

But let's not introduce new letter issues.

Back to guessing: let's choose ""title"" as our next guess? That might work? But we have T at1 and T at3? That tests both possible T positions? Let's see.

If secret word has T at position1 but not at3: then in ""title"":

- T at1: correct? Or if T is at1, then ✓
- T at3: if not present at3? Or if only one T and it's at1, then T at3 would be x? But we put T at3, and it is not present? But secret has only one T at position1? Then for T at3 we get x? But we also have T at1 ✓.

The feedback: position at1 T: if secret has T at1, ✓? yes.

Position at3 T: if secret has no T at3? And only one T at1, then it would be 'x'? Because no T at position3? And not elsewhere? But secret has T? How many? If only one, then T at position3 not present.

But feedback doesn't tell count? It only shows per letter? So for T at1: if correct position ✓? For T at3: if the secret has only one T and it's at1, then T at3 is not present: 'x'.

On the other hand, if secret has T at3 but not at1? Then T at1: '-', T at3: '✓'.

If secret has T at both? Then T at1: '-', T at3: '✓'? Or if positions correct? But position3 would be ✓.

Case:
- Secret word has T at1 (position) and no other T? Then our guess ""title"": T(1):✓ (correct position), T(3):x? Because secret has only one T and it's at1, so position3 T wrong and no extra T? So x? Then position2 I: ? etc.

If secret has T at3 only? Then T at1 in guess: not correct position? Sincell the T is at3? But we also put T at3? So T at1: '-' (because T present but not at1), T at3: ✓.

If secret has no T? But we know from previous feedback that T is present? From ""stole"" feedback T(-) means T is in the secret word? So it must be present.

So guessing ""title"" can help us distinguish:

- If T is at position1: then our guess T at1 will be ✓, and T at3 may be x or - depending? But it might tell us.

Also, by using ""title"", we are testing I at position2? And  or not? I is a new letter.

But ""title"" has I at position2? Which is a new letter.

So, it seems good.

Another option: put T at position1 only? For example, ""tulle""?: T U L L E - but L at position3? And L at position4? Which we know position4 is L? So position3 L might conflict the L at position4.

Not good? Avoid.

""tizzy"" not ends with E.

So I think ""title"" is a reasonable guess.

But let me think of words like ""tuple"": T U P L E -> positions: T at1, U at2, P at3, L at4, E at5. But then T at1 only? Not at3? So it doesn't test position3? Also P is at3.

If we use ""tuple"", then:

- T at1: if secret has T at1, ✓; if secret has T at3, '-'

- Then position2 U and position3 P provide new information.

It also doesn't have repeated T.

Similarly, ""twice""? Not ends with E.

""tube""  4 letters.

""true"" 4.

So ""tuple"" is good? Is ""tuple"" a word? Tuple is valid in computing, but in English, it might be accepted? Assume it's valid.

Other words: ""tubal"" not ends with E.

""tired"" not LE.

So ""tuple"" or ""title""? ""title"" might be better? To cover both T positions.

But ""title"" uses T twice? But if secret has no T at position3? We might waste? But it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has T at position1, and position3 a different letter? For example, ""tuple"": T U P L E -> so position3: P.

Then:

- T at1: if ✓, then secret has T at1; if '-', then T at position3.
- We learn about U at position2 and P at position3.

Whereas, in ""title"", we learn about I at position2? Both T positions tested? But we don't know which T is matched? It's messy.

So perhaps ""tuple"" is cleaner.

Then I choose ""tuple"".

Confidence:   ""tuple"": T U P L E

Avoids: C,R,A,N,S,O? T, U, P, L, E -> letters: T,U,P,L,E -> L and E we know, T,U,P new? P is not absent? Yes.

We are testing: position1 T, position2 U, position3 P.

For the secret word: we must have L at4, E at5? And T somewhere? Either position1 or3? Also, the word must be valid.

Now, based on feedback, we will know more.

So I'll guess ""tuple"".

But also, we know that from previous feedback, E is at5? But in ""tuple"", E at5 is correct? Yes, because position5 is E? And L at4? L at4? In ""tuple"", position4 is L? Yes? So L at position4 ✓? And E at5, so both fixed? Good.

Therefore: guess ""tuple"".

<guess>tuple</guess>From the previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): E is confirmed at position 5, and C, R, A, N are absent.
- Guess 2 (""stole""): T is present but not at position 2, O and S are absent, L is confirmed at position 4, and E is confirmed at position 5.

Key deductions:
1. The secret word has L at position 4 and E at position 5, so it ends with ""LE"".
2. T is in the word but must be at position 1 or 3 (since it cannot be at position 2, and positions 4–5 are fixed).
3. Absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, O) must be avoided. Remaining letters are B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The next guess should:
- Keep L at position 4 and E at position 5 to leverage known correct positions.
- Test T at position 1 to distinguish whether it belongs there or at position 3.
- Use new common letters (U and P) for positions 2 and 3 to maximize information.

""tuple"" (a valid English word) fits these constraints:
- Positions: T (1), U (2), P (3), L (4), E (5).
- Tests:
  - If T gets ""✓"", it means T is at position 1.
  - If T gets ""-"", it means T is at position 3 (since position 2 is invalid).
  - U and P are tested for presence/position and aren't eliminated letters.

This guess efficiently probes the positions of T and expands coverage to new letters.",Guess 3: tuple -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) U(x) P(x) L(✓) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)

This means:
- E is in the secret word and is in the correct position. Since E is the last letter, the secret word ends with E.
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

Since E is at the end, the secret word is _ _ _ _ E.

We know that the letters C, R, A, N are absent. Therefore, we must avoid using these letters in the next guess.

Our next guess should:
1. End with E (to confirm or get more information about the position of E).
2. Use new letters that we haven't tried yet to maximize information.

We also know that E is the only correct letter so far, and it's at the end.

We should try to use common letters that haven't been eliminated. Common consonants that we haven't tried: T, L, S, D, M, P, etc., and vowels: O, I, U (since A is out).

We must guess a valid 5-letter word ending with E.

Let's think of words ending with E that do not contain C, R, A, N.

Some options:
- types of words: like ""slate"" (but A is eliminated, so we can't use A)
- We cannot use A.

Common words ending with E:
Examples: ""house"", ""table"" (but we can't use A) ... no, A is out.

With no A and no R, N, C.

How about ""style""? Let's check: S, T, Y, L, E. 
- S, T, Y, L, E: none of these are in the eliminated list (C,R,A,N are eliminated). And we have E at the end.

Another option: ""shine"" -> S,H,I,N,E. But N is eliminated (from previous feedback: N(x)), so we cannot use N. Therefore ""shine"" is invalid because it has N.

""slide"": S,L,I,D,E -> letters S,L,I,D,E. None of S,L,I,D,E are eliminated? Eliminated are C,R,A,N. So S,L,I,D,E are all allowed.

But wait, E is already known to be at the end. So we might put E at the end and try other positions.

We should avoid using E in positions other than the last? Actually, no — the feedback doesn't say E is only at the end; it only says that at position 5 it is correct. There could be another E? But typically, words can have repeated letters, but in this case, since E is correct at the end, we don't know about other Es.

But in Wordle, sometimes there are double letters. However, to keep it simple, let's assume we avoid using E elsewhere for now to avoid confusion.

But we can use E in other positions? Actually, we can, because it might reveal if there is another E? However, the feedback will show x for letters not present and - for present in wrong position.

Given we have limited guesses, we should try to use new letters.

Possible words ending in E, without C,R,A,N:
- ""style"": S,T,Y,L,E -> T is new, Y is new, L is new. Position: S at 1, T at 2, Y at 3, L at 4, E at 5.
- ""smile"": S,M,I,L,E -> M and I are new.
- ""spite"": S,P,I,T,E -> P and T are new.
- ""slide"": S,L,I,D,E -> D is new.

But also, we have vowels: we know A is out, so we can use O, U, I.

I think a good choice would be a word that uses as many new common letters as possible.

Let's list common letters we haven't tried: letters we haven't tried: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But we avoided C,R,A,N.

Specifically, common consonants: T, L, S, D, M, P, etc.

So, I like ""slide"": 
  S at position 1, L at 2, I at 3, D at 4, E at 5.
But we don't know if E appears multiple times? We are using E at the end, which is correct, so if there is another E, we might get a '-' for the second E? But currently, we are not placing E anywhere else.

In ""slide"", E is only at the end. So we are safe.

Similarly, ""style"" uses E only at the end.

But we also need to consider that the secret word has only E as a known letter, and at the 5th position.

Another word: ""blessed""? Too long. 5 letters? Then no.

5-letter words ending with E, without C,R,A,N.

Word list: let me think...
- ""quite"": Q,U,I,T,E -> Q is uncommon but valid.
- ""spite"": S,P,I,T,E -> good letters.
- ""stole"": S,T,O,L,E -> O is a vowel.

I think ""spite"" or ""stole"" or ""slide"".

But in the feedback, we got all x except for E. So the word does not have C,R,A,N, and only has E at the last position.

We need to cover more ground.

Perhaps ""sight""? but ends with T, not E.

We need it to end with E: so ""shift""? But no, we need E.

Okay, let me choose ""smile"": S,M,I,L,E.

Or ""stole"": S,T,O,L,E.

I'll go with ""stole"": because it has O, which is a common vowel, and T, L, S which are common consonants.

We have to avoid C,R,A,N.

So, ""stole"": S in position 1, T in 2, O in 3, L in 4, E in 5.

Now, if the secret word has E in the end, we can see if any of S,T,O,L are in the word.

But note: it's possible that the secret word has E only at the end and not elsewhere? Yes.

Also, we suspect that E is at the last position.

Hence, I'll guess: ""stole""

But let me confirm: S, T, O, L, E — none are C,R,A,N. Good.

Another word: ""spoke"" — S,P,O,K,E. K is another consonant.

I think ""stole"" is good.

So, next guess: ""stole""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- E is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th).  
- C, R, A, and N are completely absent.  

The secret word must be of the form _ _ _ _ E, using only letters not yet eliminated (excluding C, R, A, N). For the next guess:  
- Prioritize words ending in E to validate the known position.  
- Include common unused letters to maximize new information (e.g., consonants like S, T, L, D, M, P or vowels like O, I, U).  
- Avoid repeating eliminated letters and reuse E cautiously, but it may appear elsewhere.  

A strong candidate is **""stole""** because:  
- Ends in E (position 5), confirming the known letter.  
- Uses new common letters: S, T, O, L (none eliminated).  
- Covers a vowel (O) and frequent consonants.  

This guess will test for the presence of S, T, O, L and reconfirm E.

<guess>stole</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) O(x) L(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th). Letters C, R, A, N are absent.
2. ""stole"": S(x) T(-) O(x) L(✓) E(✓) → 
   - S and O are absent.
   - T is present but not in the 2nd position.
   - L is in the correct position (4th? Let's check: in ""stole"", L is the 4th letter? Position: 1-S, 2-T, 3-O, 4-L, 5-E. So L is at 4 and correct). 
   - E is correct at position 5.

So, from feedback:
- Correct letters and positions: E at position 5, L at position 4.
- Present letters but wrong position: T (not at position 2).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must be of the form ? ? ? L E
- Must contain T, but not at position 2.
- Must not contain C, R, A, N, S, O.

Letters we know: present letters: T, L, E. But L and E have known positions: 4 and 5.

So the word is: _ _ T L E? Not necessarily T at position 3, because T is somewhere else but not position 2? T was in position 2 in ""stole"" but got (-), meaning it's in the word but not at that position. So T must be at position 1 or 3? Because position 4 and 5 are L and E.

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4=L, 5=E.

T was guessed at position 2, so it cannot be position 2. It could be position 1 or 3? Or maybe position 3? Wait, positions: 1, 3, or maybe 4? But position 4 is L, so T cannot be 4 because L is there. Similarly, position 5 is E. So T can only be at position 1 or 3.

Therefore, the word must have:
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: E
- T either at position 1 or position 3.
- And one more letter at the remaining position (if T is at 1, then positions 2 and 3 are for other letters; if T is at 3, then positions 1 and 2 for other letters).

But we also know that the word has exactly one T? Not necessarily, it might have more, but we don't know.

Absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,O are all absent. So we avoid any word with those letters.

Possible letters: we have used: C,R,A,N,E (in crane), and then S,T,O,L in stole. So absent: C,R,A,N,S,O. Therefore, available letters: all others: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

The word is: ? ? ? L E, with T in either position 1 or 3, and the remaining positions being some letters from available set.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Case 1: T at position 1.
Then word: T ? ? L E
Position 2 and 3 must be filled with letters not in {C,R,A,N,S,O} and not T? (could be T? but we don't know if repeated letters are allowed). But since we got T only once in feedback? Actually, feedback might show T once even if repeated, but no information. We should avoid if not necessary.

But for now, assume no duplicates if not forced.

So: T [pos2] [pos3] L E

Case 2: T at position 3.
Then word: ? ? T L E
Position 1 and 2 must be filled with available letters.

Also, note: from ""stole"", we had T at position 2 which got '-', meaning the word has T elsewhere. Also, in ""crane"", we didn't have T, but then we got it in ""stole"".

We need to make a guess that uses these constraints.

We need a word that:
- Ends with L E (positions 4 and 5: L and E)
- Has a T in it (at either position 1 or 3)
- Uses available letters (excluding C,R,A,N,S,O)

Let's think of common words ending in LE? But the word ends with LE? Not necessarily: it ends with LE only if positions 4 and 5 are L and E, so the last two letters are LE? Yes, it ends with ""LE"".

But actually, position 4 is L and position 5 is E, so the word ends with LE? Yes, because position 5 is E so the last letter is E, and second last is L? No: position 4 is L (second last), position 5 is E (last). So the word ends with ""LE"". For example: ""table"" ends in LE? T-A-B-L-E -> positions: T at1, A at2, B at3, L at4, E at5. So ending with ""LE"" actually? The string would be ? L E, but when we read the word, the last two characters are ""LE""? In terms of spelling, yes, but ""LE"" is not a separate unit.

The word must have second-to-last letter L and last letter E.

We can think of words that have the form ____LE.

But also they contain a T in position 1 or 3.

Possible words:

If T at position 1: T _ _ L E
Then a word like ""title"": but T-I-T-L-E -> position1 T, position2 I, position3 T, position4 L, position5 E. But then we have T at pos1 and pos3? But we have only one T? We got feedback for ""stole"": only one T marked? Actually, we had one T at position2 which got '-', meaning at least one T is present, but there could be more? Let me see the feedback: ""T(-)"" meaning that there is a T in the word but not at position2. So it could be one or more.

But let's check for duplicates: if we use T at position1, then position3 could be anything? But we have to avoid absent letters.

Word ""title"" has T at1 and T at3? But we don't know if the secret word has two Ts? And also, we have S absent? ""title"" has I and L,E, and T.

Letters: T, I, T, L, E -> T and T are same. But we used T once? In feedback, we saw that T was present? We did not get information about the count? Actually, if there were two Ts, in ""stole"", we only had one T guessed? So if the secret word had two Ts, and one of them was not guessed? But we guessed T only at position2? Then for the second T, if it were present, it might have been caught? No, because we didn't guess T elsewhere.

In ""stole"", the T was at position2, and we got '-', meaning there is a T in the word but not at pos2. It does not indicate if there are other Ts. So we must consider possibility of multiple Ts? But for now, let's avoid if not necessary? Since we have limited guesses, we can try to resolve the position of T with our next guess.

But we need to come up with a guess. Our next guess should be a word with L at position4 and E at position5? We don't have to; we can guess a word that might not have L E at the end? But we know L and E are at positions 4 and 5? Actually, we know that from feedback? For positions: in ""stole"", L was at position4 and got marked ✓, meaning L is in the correct position (4). Similarly, E at position5 ✓. So we know the secret word has L at position4 and E at position5. So the ending is fixed: positions 4 and 5 - L and E.

Therefore, we must have in our next guess: at position4: L, and position5: E? We don't have to, but if we change them, we might waste information? Because we know they are correct, it would be inefficient to move them.

Usually, we keep the known letters in their positions.

So our guess should have L at position4, E at position5.

Then, position1,2,3: we need to use letters not absent, and we need to put T only if we want to test? But we know T is in the word? Actually, we know T is present? But we don't know the position? It must be at position1 or3.

So we need to try to find what letters go in positions 1,2,3.

For position2, we know T is not there? T is not at position2? But we don't know about other letters.

We should use a word that has:

Position1: a letter we want to test
Position2: a letter we want to test
Position3: either T (if we think T is there) or another letter

But we need to distinguish: is T at position1 or position3?

If we put T at position1 in our guess, then:
- If T is actually at position1: then we get ✓ for T
- If not (i.e., T is at position3): then we get '-' for T? Since T is in the word but at wrong position.

Similarly, if we put T at position3:
- If T is at position3: ✓
- If T is at position1: '-' 

We also have position2? We must put something at position2. We should put a letter that hasn't been used? Since S,O are absent? We have absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,O.

So we can use: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and T).

So let's form a word with positions 1,2,3: we want to test T's position and other letters.

Let us assume we put T at position1 in our next guess? Then positions: T at1, ? at2, ? at3, L at4, E at5.

And we want a valid word? For example, ""tulle"" but has two L's? Or ""title"" (but we used T twice?).

Word ""title"": T I T L E -> positions: T(1), I(2), T(3), L(4), E(5). But we can do that? Then the second T at position3? But if we put T at position3, we don't know if the secret word has one T or two? Also, we used T twice? Same letter can be used multiple times? For example, ""title"" has two Ts.

But is that valid? Yes, words can have repeated letters.

But in our case, we don't know if secret word has multiple Ts? So ""title"" would test if the secret word has T at1 and T at3? But from feedback, we only know one T present? From ""stole"" we only know one T exists? But possible more.

To test if T is at position1, put T at1 and see if it gets ✓.

If we put T at position1 and it gets ✓, then position1 is T? And position3 must be something else? Or if we put T at1 and it gets '-', then T is at position3? And avoid position1.

Similarly, for position. But also, we have position2.

We could put in position3 a different letter? Then if we put T at1 and it gets ✓, then T is at1? If it gets '-', then T must be at position3? Because we know T is in the word and positions are limited: only 1 or 3? Position2 is not available? Because we know T is not at2.

So if we guess:

Option A: Guess T at position1: then we might be able to pin T.

Similarly, we need to choose position2 and position3: we should choose common letters not tested yet.

For example: available vowels: I,U (we haven't used I,U? We used A,O,E? E is used? O is absent? A is absent? So vowels: I,U? And consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J... etc.

Let's choose a word like ""tile"" but with an extra letter? It has to be 5 letters? ""tile"" is 4? Five letter word T _ _ L E.

Ex: ""tuile"" is a word? Tuile is a thin cookie, and that is accepted? Or ""tulle"" which is netting? Or ""title""?

But let me think of good words:

""tuile"": T U I L E -> positions: T, U, I, L, E? But L is at position4? Position1:T,2:U,3:I,4:L,5:E.

Yes.

""title"": T I T L E -> positions:1:T,2:I,3:T,4:L,5:E.

""tulle"": T U L L E -> positions:1:T,2:U,3:L,4:L,5:E. That has two Ls? And L at position3? But we know L is at position4? So if we put L at position3, that might be a problem? Position4 is also L? So if the secret word has only one L, then L at position3 might be a wrong letter? But we know that position4 is L? So in ""tuile"" or ""title""?

We can use ""tizzy""? But ends with Y? Not E.

Must end with E.

So words: ""title"", ""tuile"", ""timer""? But ""timer"" ends with R? Not LE? No, must have L at4 and E at5? So the last two letters must be L E? So possible words: ""bible"", ""idle"", etc., but with T at1? or T at3.

With T at1: ""table"" but A is absent (from crane feedback). So ""table"" has A? Invalid.

""tripe"" but O is absent? Not LE? Not ending with LE.

We have to have position4:L, position5:E.

So the word must be in the form X Y Z L E? with T either X or Z.

Available letters? And avoid S,O,C,R,A,N.

With T at position1: T Y Z L E

Then Y and Z? Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common ones: H,I,M,P,U etc.

Possible words:
- ""title"" -> T-I-T-L-E -> but has T at3? Uses T twice? And I is at2. Note: T at1 and T at3.
- ""tulle"" -> T-U-L-L-E -> position3: L? But we know that L is at position4? And position3 we are putting L? But L might be present only once? We don't know: from feedback, we have one L at position4. There could be another? But if we put L at position3, and secret has only one L (at4), we put L at3 then it would be shown as '-' only if there is another position? Actually, in Wordle, if there is only one L and you put L at wrong position, it shows '-', but if you put L at another position? But if secret has one L and you put two? Then one might show ✓ and one '-'? It depends.

But that could be messy? We can avoid using L elsewhere.

Similarly, avoid using E elsewhere? Because E is at position5? Secret might have other E, but we don't know? But we haven't seen any? In crane, we had E at5 ✓, and no other E? Since we guessed only position5? In stole, we guessed E at5 ✓, so no other E tested? So if secret word has another E, we might have missed? But position5 E is fixed.

Better to avoid? Use no E except position5? Or we can use? But less confusing.

So for T Y Z L E: let Y and Z be vowels or consonants: possible words:

""title"" -> T-I-T-L-E: uses T twice? But if secret has two Ts, it would be fine? Or if one? But we don't know.

""tuile"" -> T-U-I-L-E: good? Yes, word ""tuile"" is valid? But maybe not common? Should I choose common words? Assume it's valid.

""tulle"": T-U-L-L-E: has L at position3? Which is the same letter? Might not be great? Avoid.

Another word: ""tizze""? Not a word? Probably not.

So candidate words: ""title"" and ""tuile"".

If we put T at position3: Then word: ? ? T L E

Position1 and position2.

For example: ""butle""? Not a standard word? ""beetle"" but has two E and E at position2? Ends with LE? But if we put T at position3: for example, ""motle""? Not word. ""ditle""? Not word.

Words like ""lotte"", but ends with E? L-O-T-T-E? But ends with E? Not LE? Positions: let see: position3:T, position4:L? Not necessarily? For a word like ""battle"", but ends with LE: B-A-T-T-L-E which is 6 letters? Not 5.

5-letter words ending with LE containing T at position3:

""Little""? L-I-T-T-L-E? That is 6 letters? No, ""little"" is 6: L-I-T-T-L-E.

5-letter: ""cattle""? C-A-T-T-L-E -> but C and A? Absent? Already out.

""kettle"": K-E-T-T-L-E -> K at1, E at2? But we know position5:E? And E at2? Also, avoid C,R,A,N,S,O? This has E at2? And T at3 and T? And L at4.

But we have used E? And K? So: could be? Word ""kettle"".

But if we put E at position2? It might be present? Because we know only position5 E? There could be other E? We haven't eliminated E elsewhere.

Similarly, ""mettle"": M-E-T-T-L-E -> E at2? Then we lose position? But we have to have L at4 and E at5? Yes.

But ""kettle"" or ""mettle"" have T at position3? Position: ""kettle"" -> K at1, E at2, T at3, T at4? No: spelling: K-E-T-T-L-E? That is 6 letters? K-E-T-T-L-E? K-E-T-T-L-E is 6 positions? Oh, mistake.

Standard spelling: ""kettle"" is K-E-T-T-L-E? Not? No, ""kettle"" is K-E-T-T-L-E? Actually, no: 
K-E-T-T-L-E -> 6 letters? Yes, 6? But Word is 5-letter? I think ""kettle"" has double T? But let me count: K E T T L E -> that's 6 characters? But dictionary: kettle is spelled with 6: K-E-T-T-L-E? But it's sometimes listed as 6. 

Five letter words ending with LE that have T at position3:

""metal""? But ends with AL? Not LE.

""total""? Ends with AL? Not LE.

Actually, 5-letter words ending in LE are not common? Common ones: ""apple"", ""ample"", ""beetle"", ""eagle"", etc., but not ending in T? Position3 T.

Example: ""bottle"", ""battle"", ""cattle"", ""kittle"", ""mettle"", ""nettle"", etc., but they are 6 letters? No, ""bottle"" is B-O-T-T-L-E? That is 6? No: B-O-T-T-L-E? B-O-T-T-L-E has positions: 1:B,2:O,3:T,4:T,5:L,6:E? So it's 6 letters? That can't be in a 5-letter Wordle.

I think I have a confusion: in Wordle, all words are exactly 5 letters? So let me think of 5-letter words exactly.

Five-letter words ending with LE: e.g. ""idle"", ""eagle"", ""bugle"", ""noble"", ""sable"", ""table"", ""bible"", ""title"", ""rifle"", ""cycle"", etc.

But ""cycle"" has C? Absent? ""table"" has A? Absent? ""noble"" has O? Absent? ""idle"": I-D-L-E? I at1, D at2, L at3, E at4? Not LE at end? Position: for ""idle"": positions:1:I,2:D,3:L,4:E? That would be 4-letter? No, wait: ""idle"" is 4 letters? Oh, big mistake.

""Idle"" is I-D-L-E: 4 letters? Then 5-letter words: e.g. ""bevel"", ""travel"", ""gravel"", ""swell"", etc.? But not ending with LE? The suffix LE does not mean it must be L then E? In Spelling, many words end with _ _ _ L E, so position4 L, position5 E? Yes.

Examples: ""apple"" - A-P-P-L-E? 5 letters? Yes? Positions: 1:A,2:P,3:P,4:L,5:E -> ends with LE? Yes.

""maple"": M-A-P-L-E -> 1:M,2:A,3:P,4:L,5:E.

But A is absent? So no.

""eagle"": E-A-G-L-E -> has A? Absent? ""bugle"": B-U-G-L-E -> no A or C? B,U,G,L,E -> avoid C,R,A,N,S,O? U is available? G is available.

Similarly, ""title"": T-I-T-L-E -> available letters? T,I,T,L,E. But T repeated? And we used T? Available? Yes, if not absent? But T at position3?

Back to our constraint: T must be at position1 or3? If we choose a word with T at position3? For example: ""title"" has T at position3? Also at1? Let's see: T at1, I at2, T at3 -> so T at3.

Or ""bezel"": B-E-Z-E-L-E? Not? ""bezel"" is B-E-Z-E-L? Ends with EL? Not LE? So L is at5? Position4 E? Not.

Words to have position4:L, position5:E? So character positions: letter4 must be L, letter5 must be E? Yes.

So word: ? ? ? L E.

For T to be at position3: word: ? ? T L E.

Example: ""beetle"" has two E, but it is 6 letters? ""little"" 6 letters.

Must be 5-letter? Possible words: ""cable"", ""fable"", ""gable"", but have A? Absent? ""noble"" has O? Absent? ""maple"" has A? Absent? ""eagle"" has A? Absent? ""bugle"": B-U-G-L-E -> positions:1:B,2:U,3:G,4:L,5:E -> this has T at position3? G is at3, not T? We need T at position3? So ""bugle"" has G at3.

Similarly, ""title"": T-I-T-L-E -> positions:1:T,2:I,3:T,4:L,5:E -> so position3 is T? Yes? Position3 is T? And position1 is T? But position3 is T.

So yes, ""title"" has T at position3? And also at1? But we don't care about position1? We need to see whether we want to test it.

Another word: ""whittle"" too long? ""tulle"" is T-U-L-L-E -> 5 letters: T,U,L,L,E? So positions:1:T,2:U,3:L,4:L,5:E -> position3 is L? But we know L is at position4? So having L at position3 might be an issue? But if secret has L only at position4, then an L at position3 will get 'x' if only one L? But if secret has two L, then it could be '-'.

But let's not introduce new letter issues.

Back to guessing: let's choose ""title"" as our next guess? That might work? But we have T at1 and T at3? That tests both possible T positions? Let's see.

If secret word has T at position1 but not at3: then in ""title"":

- T at1: correct? Or if T is at1, then ✓
- T at3: if not present at3? Or if only one T and it's at1, then T at3 would be x? But we put T at3, and it is not present? But secret has only one T at position1? Then for T at3 we get x? But we also have T at1 ✓.

The feedback: position at1 T: if secret has T at1, ✓? yes.

Position at3 T: if secret has no T at3? And only one T at1, then it would be 'x'? Because no T at position3? And not elsewhere? But secret has T? How many? If only one, then T at position3 not present.

But feedback doesn't tell count? It only shows per letter? So for T at1: if correct position ✓? For T at3: if the secret has only one T and it's at1, then T at3 is not present: 'x'.

On the other hand, if secret has T at3 but not at1? Then T at1: '-', T at3: '✓'.

If secret has T at both? Then T at1: '-', T at3: '✓'? Or if positions correct? But position3 would be ✓.

Case:
- Secret word has T at1 (position) and no other T? Then our guess ""title"": T(1):✓ (correct position), T(3):x? Because secret has only one T and it's at1, so position3 T wrong and no extra T? So x? Then position2 I: ? etc.

If secret has T at3 only? Then T at1 in guess: not correct position? Sincell the T is at3? But we also put T at3? So T at1: '-' (because T present but not at1), T at3: ✓.

If secret has no T? But we know from previous feedback that T is present? From ""stole"" feedback T(-) means T is in the secret word? So it must be present.

So guessing ""title"" can help us distinguish:

- If T is at position1: then our guess T at1 will be ✓, and T at3 may be x or - depending? But it might tell us.

Also, by using ""title"", we are testing I at position2? And  or not? I is a new letter.

But ""title"" has I at position2? Which is a new letter.

So, it seems good.

Another option: put T at position1 only? For example, ""tulle""?: T U L L E - but L at position3? And L at position4? Which we know position4 is L? So position3 L might conflict the L at position4.

Not good? Avoid.

""tizzy"" not ends with E.

So I think ""title"" is a reasonable guess.

But let me think of words like ""tuple"": T U P L E -> positions: T at1, U at2, P at3, L at4, E at5. But then T at1 only? Not at3? So it doesn't test position3? Also P is at3.

If we use ""tuple"", then:

- T at1: if secret has T at1, ✓; if secret has T at3, '-'

- Then position2 U and position3 P provide new information.

It also doesn't have repeated T.

Similarly, ""twice""? Not ends with E.

""tube""  4 letters.

""true"" 4.

So ""tuple"" is good? Is ""tuple"" a word? Tuple is valid in computing, but in English, it might be accepted? Assume it's valid.

Other words: ""tubal"" not ends with E.

""tired"" not LE.

So ""tuple"" or ""title""? ""title"" might be better? To cover both T positions.

But ""title"" uses T twice? But if secret has no T at position3? We might waste? But it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has T at position1, and position3 a different letter? For example, ""tuple"": T U P L E -> so position3: P.

Then:

- T at1: if ✓, then secret has T at1; if '-', then T at position3.
- We learn about U at position2 and P at position3.

Whereas, in ""title"", we learn about I at position2? Both T positions tested? But we don't know which T is matched? It's messy.

So perhaps ""tuple"" is cleaner.

Then I choose ""tuple"".

Confidence:   ""tuple"": T U P L E

Avoids: C,R,A,N,S,O? T, U, P, L, E -> letters: T,U,P,L,E -> L and E we know, T,U,P new? P is not absent? Yes.

We are testing: position1 T, position2 U, position3 P.

For the secret word: we must have L at4, E at5? And T somewhere? Either position1 or3? Also, the word must be valid.

Now, based on feedback, we will know more.

So I'll guess ""tuple"".

But also, we know that from previous feedback, E is at5? But in ""tuple"", E at5 is correct? Yes, because position5 is E? And L at4? L at4? In ""tuple"", position4 is L? Yes? So L at position4 ✓? And E at5, so both fixed? Good.

Therefore: guess ""tuple"".

<guess>tuple</guess>From the previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): E is confirmed at position 5, and C, R, A, N are absent.
- Guess 2 (""stole""): T is present but not at position 2, O and S are absent, L is confirmed at position 4, and E is confirmed at position 5.

Key deductions:
1. The secret word has L at position 4 and E at position 5, so it ends with ""LE"".
2. T is in the word but must be at position 1 or 3 (since it cannot be at position 2, and positions 4–5 are fixed).
3. Absent letters (C, R, A, N, S, O) must be avoided. Remaining letters are B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The next guess should:
- Keep L at position 4 and E at position 5 to leverage known correct positions.
- Test T at position 1 to distinguish whether it belongs there or at position 3.
- Use new common letters (U and P) for positions 2 and 3 to maximize information.

""tuple"" (a valid English word) fits these constraints:
- Positions: T (1), U (2), P (3), L (4), E (5).
- Tests:
  - If T gets ""✓"", it means T is at position 1.
  - If T gets ""-"", it means T is at position 3 (since position 2 is invalid).
  - U and P are tested for presence/position and aren't eliminated letters.

This guess efficiently probes the positions of T and expands coverage to new letters.

But no, we need E.\n\nOkay, let me choose ""smile"": S,M,I,L,E.\n\nOr ""stole"": S,T,O,L,E.\n\nI\'ll go with ""stole"": because it has O, which is a common vowel, and T, L, S which are common consonants.\n\nWe have to avoid C,R,A,N.\n\nSo, ""stole"": S in position 1, T in 2, O in 3, L in 4, E in 5.\n\nNow, if the secret word has E in the end, we can see if any of S,T,O,L are in the word.\n\nBut note: it\'s possible that the secret word has E only at the end and not elsewhere?

""stole"": S(x) T(-) O(x) L(✓) E(✓) → \n   - S and O are absent.\n   - T is present but not in the 2nd position.\n   - L is in the correct position (4th? Let\'s check: in ""stole"", L is the 4th letter? Position: 1-S, 2-T, 3-O, 4-L, 5-E. So L is at 4 and correct). \n   - E is correct at position 5.\n\nSo, from feedback:\n- Correct letters and positions: E at position 5, L at position 4.\n- Present letters but wrong position: T (not at position 2).\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O.\n\nTherefore, the secret word:\n- Must be of the form ? ? ? L E\n- Must contain T, but not at position 2.\n- Must not contain C, R, A, N, S, O.\n\nLetters we know: present letters: T, L, E. But L and E have known positions: 4 and 5.\n\nSo the word is: _ _ T L E? Not necessarily T at position 3, because T is somewhere else but not position 2? T was in position 2 in ""stole"" but got (-), meaning it\'s in the word but not at that position. So T must be at position 1 or 3? Because position 4 and 5 are L and E.\n\nPositions: 1, 2, 3, 4=L, 5=E.\n\nT was guessed at position 2, so it cannot be position 2. It could be position 1 or 3? Or maybe position 3? Wait, positions: 1, 3, or maybe 4? But position 4 is L, so T cannot be 4 because L is there. Similarly, position 5 is E. So T can only be at position 1 or 3.\n\nTherefore, the word must have:\n- Position 4: L\n- Position 5: E\n- T either at position 1 or position 3.\n- And one more letter at the remaining position (if T is at 1, then positions 2 and 3 are for other letters; if T is at 3, then positions 1 and 2 for other letters).\n\nBut we also know that the word has exactly one T? Not necessarily, it might have more, but we don\'t know.\n\nAbsent letters: C,R,A,N,S,O are all absent. So we avoid any word with those letters.\n\nPossible letters: we have used: C,R,A,N,E (in crane), and then S,T,O,L in stole. So absent: C,R,A,N,S,O. Therefore, available letters: all others: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nThe word is: ? ? ? L E, with T in either position 1 or 3, and the remaining positions being some letters from available set.\n\nLet\'s consider the possibilities:\n\nCase 1: T at position 1.\nThen word: T ? ? L E\nPosition 2 and 3 must be filled with letters not in {C,R,A,N,S,O} and not T? (could be T? but we don\'t know if repeated letters are allowed). But since we got T only once in feedback? Actually, feedback might show T once even if repeated, but no information. We should avoid if not necessary.\n\nBut for now, assume no duplicates if not forced.\n\nSo: T [pos2] [pos3] L E\n\nCase 2: T at position 3.\nThen word: ? ? T L E\nPosition 1 and 2 must be filled with available letters.\n\nAlso, note: from ""stole"", we had T at position 2 which got \'-\', meaning the word has T elsewhere. Also, in ""crane"", we didn\'t have T, but then we got it in ""stole"".\n\nWe need to make a guess that uses these constraints.\n\nWe need a word that:\n- Ends with L E (positions 4 and 5: L and E)\n- Has a T in it (at either position 1 or 3)\n- Uses available letters (excluding C,R,A,N,S,O)\n\nLet\'s think of common words ending in LE? But the word ends with LE? Not necessarily: it ends with LE only if positions 4 and 5 are L and E, so the last two letters are LE? Yes, it ends with ""LE"".\n\nBut actually, position 4 is L and position 5 is E, so the word ends with LE? Yes, because position 5 is E so the last letter is E, and second last is L? No: position 4 is L (second last), position 5 is E (last). So the word ends with ""LE"". For example: ""table"" ends in LE? T-A-B-L-E -> positions: T at1, A at2, B at3, L at4, E at5. So ending with ""LE"" actually? The string would be ? L E, but when we read the word, the last two characters are ""LE""? In terms of spelling, yes, but ""LE"" is not a separate unit.\n\nThe word must have second-to-last letter L and last letter E.\n\nWe can think of words that have the form ____LE.\n\nBut also they contain a T in position 1 or 3.\n\nPossible words:\n\nIf T at position 1: T _ _ L E\nThen a word like ""title"": but T-I-T-L-E -> position1 T, position2 I, position3 T, position4 L, position5 E. But then we have T at pos1 and pos3? But we have only one T? We got feedback for ""stole"": only one T marked? Actually, we had one T at position2 which got \'-\', meaning at least one T is present, but there could be more? Let me see the feedback: ""T(-)"" meaning that there is a T in the word but not at position2. So it could be one or more.\n\nBut let\'s check for duplicates: if we use T at position1, then position3 could be anything? But we have to avoid absent letters.\n\nWord ""title"" has T at1 and T at3? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two Ts? And also, we have S absent? ""title"" has I and L,E, and T.\n\nLetters: T, I, T, L, E -> T and T are same. But we used T once? In feedback, we saw that T was present? We did not get information about the count? Actually, if there were two Ts, in ""stole"", we only had one T guessed? So if the secret word had two Ts, and one of them was not guessed? But we guessed T only at position2? Then for the second T, if it were present, it might have been caught? No, because we didn\'t guess T elsewhere.\n\nIn ""stole"", the T was at position2, and we got \'-\', meaning there is a T in the word but not at pos2. It does not indicate if there are other Ts. So we must consider possibility of multiple Ts? But for now, let\'s avoid if not necessary? Since we have limited guesses, we can try to resolve the position of T with our next guess.\n\nBut we need to come up with a guess. Our next guess should be a word with L at position4 and E at position5? We don\'t have to; we can guess a word that might not have L E at the end? But we know L and E are at positions 4 and 5? Actually, we know that from feedback? For positions: in ""stole"", L was at position4 and got marked ✓, meaning L is in the correct position (4). Similarly, E at position5 ✓. So we know the secret word has L at position4 and E at position5. So the ending is fixed: positions 4 and 5 - L and E.\n\nTherefore, we must have in our next guess: at position4: L, and position5: E? We don\'t have to, but if we change them, we might waste information? Because we know they are correct, it would be inefficient to move them.\n\nUsually, we keep the known letters in their positions.\n\nSo our guess should have L at position4, E at position5.\n\nThen, position1,2,3: we need to use letters not absent, and we need to put T only if we want to test? But we know T is in the word? Actually, we know T is present? But we don\'t know the position? It must be at position1 or3.\n\nSo we need to try to find what letters go in positions 1,2,3.\n\nFor position2, we know T is not there? T is not at position2? But we don\'t know about other letters.\n\nWe should use a word that has:\n\nPosition1: a letter we want to test\nPosition2: a letter we want to test\nPosition3: either T (if we think T is there) or another letter\n\nBut we need to distinguish: is T at position1 or position3?\n\nIf we put T at position1 in our guess, then:\n- If T is actually at position1: then we get ✓ for T\n- If not (i.e., T is at position3): then we get \'-\' for T? Since T is in the word but at wrong position.\n\nSimilarly, if we put T at position3:\n- If T is at position3: ✓\n- If T is at position1: \'-\' \n\nWe also have position2? We must put something at position2. We should put a letter that hasn\'t been used? Since S,O are absent? We have absent letters: C,R,A,N,S,O.\n\nSo we can use: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (and T).\n\nSo let\'s form a word with positions 1,2,3: we want to test T\'s position and other letters.\n\nLet us assume we put T at position1 in our next guess? Then positions: T at1, ? at2, ? at3, L at4, E at5.\n\nAnd we want a valid word? For example, ""tulle"" but has two L\'s? Or ""title"" (but we used T twice?).\n\nWord ""title"": T I T L E -> positions: T(1), I(2), T(3), L(4), E(5). But we can do that? Then the second T at position3? But if we put T at position3, we don\'t know if the secret word has one T or two? Also, we used T twice? Same letter can be used multiple times? For example, ""title"" has two Ts.\n\nBut is that valid? Yes, words can have repeated letters.\n\nBut in our case, we don\'t know if secret word has multiple Ts? So ""title"" would test if the secret word has T at1 and T at3? But from feedback, we only know one T present? From ""stole"" we only know one T exists? But possible more.\n\nTo test if T is at position1, put T at1 and see if it gets ✓.\n\nIf we put T at position1 and it gets ✓, then position1 is T? And position3 must be something else? Or if we put T at1 and it gets \'-\', then T is at position3? And avoid position1.\n\nSimilarly, for position. But also, we have position2.\n\nWe could put in position3 a different letter? Then if we put T at1 and it gets ✓, then T is at1? If it gets \'-\', then T must be at position3? Because we know T is in the word and positions are limited: only 1 or 3? Position2 is not available? Because we know T is not at2.\n\nSo if we guess:\n\nOption A: Guess T at position1: then we might be able to pin T.\n\nSimilarly, we need to choose position2 and position3: we should choose common letters not tested yet.\n\nFor example: available vowels: I,U (we haven\'t used I,U? We used A,O,E? E is used? O is absent? A is absent? So vowels: I,U? And consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J... etc.\n\nLet\'s choose a word like ""tile"" but with an extra letter? It has to be 5 letters? ""tile"" is 4? Five letter word T _ _ L E.\n\nEx: ""tuile"" is a word? Tuile is a thin cookie, and that is accepted? Or ""tulle"" which is netting? Or ""title""?\n\nBut let me think of good words:\n\n""tuile"": T U I L E -> positions: T, U, I, L, E? But L is at position4? Position1:T,2:U,3:I,4:L,5:E.\n\nYes.\n\n""title"": T I T L E -> positions:1:T,2:I,3:T,4:L,5:E.\n\n""tulle"": T U L L E -> positions:1:T,2:U,3:L,4:L,5:E. That has two Ls? And L at position3? But we know L is at position4? So if we put L at position3, that might be a problem? Position4 is also L? So if the secret word has only one L, then L at position3 might be a wrong letter? But we know that position4 is L? So in ""tuile"" or ""title""?\n\nWe can use ""tizzy""? But ends with Y? Not E.\n\nMust end with E.\n\nSo words: ""title"", ""tuile"", ""timer""? But ""timer"" ends with R? Not LE? No, must have L at4 and E at5? So the last two letters must be L E? So possible words: ""bible"", ""idle"", etc., but with T at1? or T at3.\n\nWith T at1: ""table"" but A is absent (from crane feedback). So ""table"" has A? Invalid.\n\n""tripe"" but O is absent? Not LE? Not ending with LE.\n\nWe have to have position4:L, position5:E.\n\nSo the word must be in the form X Y Z L E? with T either X or Z.\n\nAvailable letters? And avoid S,O,C,R,A,N.\n\nWith T at position1: T Y Z L E\n\nThen Y and Z? Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nCommon ones: H,I,M,P,U etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""title"" -> T-I-T-L-E -> but has T at3? Uses T twice? And I is at2. Note: T at1 and T at3.\n- ""tulle"" -> T-U-L-L-E -> position3: L? But we know that L is at position4? And position3 we are putting L? But L might be present only once? We don\'t know: from feedback, we have one L at position4. There could be another? But if we put L at position3, and secret has only one L (at4), we put L at3 then it would be shown as \'-\' only if there is another position? Actually, in Wordle, if there is only one L and you put L at wrong position, it shows \'-\', but if you put L at another position? But if secret has one L and you put two? Then one might show ✓ and one \'-\'? It depends.\n\nBut that could be messy? We can avoid using L elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, avoid using E elsewhere? Because E is at position5? Secret might have other E, but we don\'t know? But we haven\'t seen any? In crane, we had E at5 ✓, and no other E? Since we guessed only position5? In stole, we guessed E at5 ✓, so no other E tested? So if secret word has another E, we might have missed? But position5 E is fixed.\n\nBetter to avoid? Use no E except position5? Or we can use? But less confusing.\n\nSo for T Y Z L E: let Y and Z be vowels or consonants: possible words:\n\n""title"" -> T-I-T-L-E: uses T twice? But if secret has two Ts, it would be fine? Or if one? But we don\'t know.\n\n""tuile"" -> T-U-I-L-E: good? Yes, word ""tuile"" is valid? But maybe not common? Should I choose common words? Assume it\'s valid.\n\n""tulle"": T-U-L-L-E: has L at position3? Which is the same letter? Might not be great? Avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""tizze""? Not a word? Probably not.\n\nSo candidate words: ""title"" and ""tuile"".\n\nIf we put T at position3: Then word: ? ? T L E\n\nPosition1 and position2.\n\nFor example: ""butle""? Not a standard word? ""beetle"" but has two E and E at position2? Ends with LE? But if we put T at position3: for example, ""motle""? Not word. ""ditle""? Not word.\n\nWords like ""lotte"", but ends with E? L-O-T-T-E? But ends with E? Not LE? Positions: let see: position3:T, position4:L? Not necessarily? For a word like ""battle"", but ends with LE: B-A-T-T-L-E which is 6 letters? Not 5.\n\n5-letter words ending with LE containing T at position3:\n\n""Little""? L-I-T-T-L-E? That is 6 letters? No, ""little"" is 6: L-I-T-T-L-E.\n\n5-letter: ""cattle""? C-A-T-T-L-E -> but C and A? Absent? Already out.\n\n""kettle"": K-E-T-T-L-E -> K at1, E at2? But we know position5:E? And E at2? Also, avoid C,R,A,N,S,O? This has E at2? And T at3 and T? And L at4.\n\nBut we have used E? And K? So: could be? Word ""kettle"".\n\nBut if we put E at position2? It might be present? Because we know only position5 E? There could be other E? We haven\'t eliminated E elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, ""mettle"": M-E-T-T-L-E -> E at2? Then we lose position? But we have to have L at4 and E at5? Yes.\n\nBut ""kettle"" or ""mettle"" have T at position3? Position: ""kettle"" -> K at1, E at2, T at3, T at4? No: spelling: K-E-T-T-L-E? That is 6 letters? K-E-T-T-L-E? K-E-T-T-L-E is 6 positions? Oh, mistake.\n\nStandard spelling: ""kettle"" is K-E-T-T-L-E? Not? No, ""kettle"" is K-E-T-T-L-E? Actually, no: \nK-E-T-T-L-E -> 6 letters? Yes, 6? But Word is 5-letter? I think ""kettle"" has double T? But let me count: K E T T L E -> that\'s 6 characters? But dictionary: kettle is spelled with 6: K-E-T-T-L-E? But it\'s sometimes listed as 6. \n\nFive letter words ending with LE that have T at position3:\n\n""metal""? But ends with AL? Not LE.\n\n""total""? Ends with AL? Not LE.\n\nActually, 5-letter words ending in LE are not common? Common ones: ""apple"", ""ample"", ""beetle"", ""eagle"", etc., but not ending in T? Position3 T.\n\nExample: ""bottle"", ""battle"", ""cattle"", ""kittle"", ""mettle"", ""nettle"", etc., but they are 6 letters? No, ""bottle"" is B-O-T-T-L-E? That is 6? No: B-O-T-T-L-E? B-O-T-T-L-E has positions: 1:B,2:O,3:T,4:T,5:L,6:E? So it\'s 6 letters? That can\'t be in a 5-letter Wordle.\n\nI think I have a confusion: in Wordle, all words are exactly 5 letters? So let me think of 5-letter words exactly.\n\nFive-letter words ending with LE: e.g. ""idle"", ""eagle"", ""bugle"", ""noble"", ""sable"", ""table"", ""bible"", ""title"", ""rifle"", ""cycle"", etc.\n\nBut ""cycle"" has C? Absent? ""table"" has A? Absent? ""noble"" has O? Absent? ""idle"": I-D-L-E? I at1, D at2, L at3, E at4? Not LE at end? Position: for ""idle"": positions:1:I,2:D,3:L,4:E? That would be 4-letter? No, wait: ""idle"" is 4 letters? Oh, big mistake.\n\n""Idle"" is I-D-L-E: 4 letters? Then 5-letter words: e.g. ""bevel"", ""travel"", ""gravel"", ""swell"", etc.? But not ending with LE? The suffix LE does not mean it must be L then E? In Spelling, many words end with _ _ _ L E, so position4 L, position5 E? Yes.\n\nExamples: ""apple"" - A-P-P-L-E? 5 letters? Yes? Positions: 1:A,2:P,3:P,4:L,5:E -> ends with LE? Yes.\n\n""maple"": M-A-P-L-E -> 1:M,2:A,3:P,4:L,5:E.\n\nBut A is absent? So no.\n\n""eagle"": E-A-G-L-E -> has A? Absent? ""bugle"": B-U-G-L-E -> no A or C? B,U,G,L,E -> avoid C,R,A,N,S,O? U is available? G is available.\n\nSimilarly, ""title"": T-I-T-L-E -> available letters? T,I,T,L,E. But T repeated? And we used T? Available? Yes, if not absent? But T at position3?\n\nBack to our constraint: T must be at position1 or3? If we choose a word with T at position3? For example: ""title"" has T at position3? Also at1? Let\'s see: T at1, I at2, T at3 -> so T at3.\n\nOr ""bezel"": B-E-Z-E-L-E? Not? ""bezel"" is B-E-Z-E-L? Ends with EL? Not LE? So L is at5? Position4 E? Not.\n\nWords to have position4:L, position5:E? So character positions: letter4 must be L, letter5 must be E? Yes.\n\nSo word: ? ? ? L E.\n\nFor T to be at position3: word: ? ? T L E.\n\nExample: ""beetle"" has two E, but it is 6 letters? ""little"" 6 letters.\n\nMust be 5-letter? Possible words: ""cable"", ""fable"", ""gable"", but have A? Absent? ""noble"" has O? Absent? ""maple"" has A? Absent? ""eagle"" has A? Absent? ""bugle"": B-U-G-L-E -> positions:1:B,2:U,3:G,4:L,5:E -> this has T at position3? G is at3, not T? We need T at position3? So ""bugle"" has G at3.\n\nSimilarly, ""title"": T-I-T-L-E -> positions:1:T,2:I,3:T,4:L,5:E -> so position3 is T? Yes? Position3 is T? And position1 is T? But position3 is T.\n\nSo yes, ""title"" has T at position3? And also at1? But we don\'t care about position1? We need to see whether we want to test it.\n\nAnother word: ""whittle"" too long? ""tulle"" is T-U-L-L-E -> 5 letters: T,U,L,L,E? So positions:1:T,2:U,3:L,4:L,5:E -> position3 is L? But we know L is at position4? So having L at position3 might be an issue? But if secret has L only at position4, then an L at position3 will get \'x\' if only one L? But if secret has two L, then it could be \'-\'.\n\nBut let\'s not introduce new letter issues.\n\nBack to guessing: let\'s choose ""title"" as our next guess? That might work? But we have T at1 and T at3? That tests both possible T positions? Let\'s see.\n\nIf secret word has T at position1 but not at3: then in ""title"":\n\n- T at1: correct? Or if T is at1, then ✓\n- T at3: if not present at3? Or if only one T and it\'s at1, then T at3 would be x? But we put T at3, and it is not present? But secret has only one T at position1? Then for T at3 we get x? But we also have T at1 ✓.\n\nThe feedback: position at1 T: if secret has T at1, ✓? yes.\n\nPosition at3 T: if secret has no T at3? And only one T at1, then it would be \'x\'? Because no T at position3? And not elsewhere? But secret has T? How many? If only one, then T at position3 not present.\n\nBut feedback doesn\'t tell count? It only shows per letter? So for T at1: if correct position ✓? For T at3: if the secret has only one T and it\'s at1, then T at3 is not present: \'x\'.\n\nOn the other hand, if secret has T at3 but not at1? Then T at1: \'-\', T at3: \'✓\'.\n\nIf secret has T at both? Then T at1: \'-\', T at3: \'✓\'? Or if positions correct? But position3 would be ✓.\n\nCase:\n- Secret word has T at1 (position) and no other T? Then our guess ""title"": T(1):✓ (correct position), T(3):x? Because secret has only one T and it\'s at1, so position3 T wrong and no extra T? So x? Then position2 I: ? etc.\n\nIf secret has T at3 only? Then T at1 in guess: not correct position? Sincell the T is at3? But we also put T at3? So T at1: \'-\' (because T present but not at1), T at3: ✓.\n\nIf secret has no T? But we know from previous feedback that T is present? From ""stole"" feedback T(-) means T is in the secret word? So it must be present.\n\nSo guessing ""title"" can help us distinguish:\n\n- If T is at position1: then our guess T at1 will be ✓, and T at3 may be x or - depending? But it might tell us.\n\nAlso, by using ""title"", we are testing I at position2? And  or not? I is a new letter.\n\nBut ""title"" has I at position2? Which is a new letter.\n\nSo, it seems good.\n\nAnother option: put T at position1 only? For example, ""tulle""?: T U L L E - but L at position3? And L at position4? Which we know position4 is L? So position3 L might conflict the L at position4.\n\nNot good? Avoid.\n\n""tizzy"" not ends with E.\n\nSo I think ""title"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut let me think of words like ""tuple"": T U P L E -> positions: T at1, U at2, P at3, L at4, E at5. But then T at1 only? Not at3? So it doesn\'t test position3? Also P is at3.\n\nIf we use ""tuple"", then:\n\n- T at1: if secret has T at1, ✓; if secret has T at3, \'-\'\n\n- Then position2 U and position3 P provide new information.\n\nIt also doesn\'t have repeated T.\n\nSimilarly, ""twice""? Not ends with E.\n\n""tube""  4 letters.\n\n""true"" 4.\n\nSo ""tuple"" is good? Is ""tuple"" a word? Tuple is valid in computing, but in English, it might be accepted? Assume it\'s valid.\n\nOther words: ""tubal"" not ends with E.\n\n""tired"" not LE.\n\nSo ""tuple"" or ""title""? ""title"" might be better? To cover both T positions.\n\nBut ""title"" uses T twice? But if secret has no T at position3? We might waste? But it\'s acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that has T at position1, and position3 a different letter? For example, ""tuple"": T U P L E -> so position3: P.\n\nThen:\n\n- T at1: if ✓, then secret has T at1; if \'-\', then T at position3.\n- We learn about U at position2 and P at position3.\n\nWhereas, in ""title"", we learn about I at position2? Both T positions tested? But we don\'t know which T is matched? It\'s messy.\n\nSo perhaps ""tuple"" is cleaner.\n\nThen I choose ""tuple"".\n\nConfidence:   ""tuple"": T U P L E\n\nAvoids: C,R,A,N,S,O? T, U, P, L, E -> letters: T,U,P,L,E -> L and E we know, T,U,P new? P is not absent? Yes.\n\nWe are testing: position1 T, position2 U, position3 P.\n\nFor the secret word: we must have L at4, E at5? And T somewhere? Either position1 or3?

We have new feedback from guess 3 ""tuple"": T(✓) U(x) P(x) L(✓) E(✓)

Breaking down:
- T at position 1 is correct (so secret word starts with T).
- U at position 2 is not in the word (absent).
- P at position 3 is not in the word (absent).
- L at position 4 is correct (as before).
- E at position 5 is correct (as before).

Also, from previous feedback:
- E at position 5 (from guess 1).
- L at position 4 (from guess 2).
- T is in the word (from guess 2) and now confirmed at position 1 (from guess 3).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O, U, P.

Since T is at position 1 and L at 4 and E at 5, the secret word is: T _ _ L E

We now know positions 1, 4, 5: T, L, E.

We need to figure out the letters for positions 2 and 3.

Constraints:
- The letters must not be in the absent list: C, R, A, N, S, O, U, P.
- From guess 1 and 2, we know letters that are absent.

Remaining possible letters: all letters not eliminated. Eliminated: C, R, A, N, S, O, U, P.

So possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: E, L, T are present but already used correctly, so if duplicated? But we don't know; we must be cautious.)

But we have positions 2 and 3 to fill.

In the secret word, position 2 and 3 must be from the remaining letters.

We know from guess 3 that U and P are absent? Therefore, we eliminate U and P.

Previous absents: C,R,A,N,S,O. Now adding U and P.

So total absent: C, R, A, N, S, O, U, P.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. And also consider that E, T, L are already placed? But they might be duplicated? However, we haven't been told about duplicates? So let me think: 

In guess 1 ""crane"": E was at position 5? But we don't know if other E are present? Similarly, in guess 2 ""stole"": L at 4? But not tested elsewhere? Similarly, T at 1? And in ""tuple"", T at1 and L&E? So we don't have information about duplicate T,L,E? 

Therefore, for positions 2 and 3? They could be any available letter? Could be any letter from the available set? Also, could be duplicates of T, L, or E? But E and T are only known to be at their positions? And L? 

But let's see: 
- If we put an E at position 2? Then if the secret word has an E at position 2? We don't know? Similarly? 

But since E is only known to be at position 5? It might be present only once? Or multiple times? We cannot assume? 

Similarly? T is at position 1? Might have more T? But we don't know? 

Therefore? We should avoid duplicates if possible? To avoid confusion? But if we choose? It might be necessary? 

We need to guess a word? That has T at 1? L at 4? E at 5? And position 2 and 3 are from available letters? 

So the word must be T ? ? L E? with ? and ? not in {C,R,A,N,S,O,U,P}

Possible common letters: H, I, M, D? Etc? 

We can try a word that uses two new letters that are common? So we get feedback on them? 

Common vowels: we have used A,E,O? So E is used? O is absent? A is absent? Therefore vowels left: I, U? But u is absent? U was eliminated? So only vowel possibilities? We can use I? Because U is absent? So vowels: I is available? 

Yes? I is not eliminated? 

Consonants: B,D,F,G,H,K,M, etc? 

So possible words: ""title"" you thought earlier? But let's see: ""title"" has T at1? I at2? T at3? L at4? E at5? 

But T at3? But we just put T at3? And P is absent? We learned? 

But in ""title"", T at1: we already know it's correct? But T at3: we don't know? Also? I at2: new? 

But does ""title"" meet the available letters? Position 2: I? Position 3: T? T is available? Since T is a valid letter? Although already used? But could be duplicated? 

Check against absent: C,R,A,N,S,O,U,P not in ""title""? Only T,I,T? L and E known? So yes? 

But the letter at position 3 is T? Which from feedback? We are putting T at position3? If there is no duplicate T? Then T at position3 might be absent? But if only one T? and it's at position1? Then it would be x? 

Alternatively? We can try a word without duplicate T? Such as ""tile"" but too short? 5 letters? We need T ? ? L E? So two letters? 

Example: ""tile"" is T I L E? 4 letters? 

So 5? ""tiles"" ends with S? Not E? 

No? We must have L at4 and E at5? So T ? ? L E? 

Common words: possible options? 
- ""tickle"" too long? 
5-letter: ""tithe""? ends with E? T-I-T-H-E? Not LE? 

Forget? ""tithe"": T-I-T-H-E? positions: 
If we map to our structure? It would be? position1 T? position2 I? position3 T? position4 H? position5 E? 
But we know position4 must be L? So not ""tithe""? 

So we need to have position4 L? 

Therefore? we need word T ? ? L E? 

Examples? ""title"": T I T L E? 
""tilde"": T I L D E? but ""tilde"": T-I-L-D-E? position2:I? position3:L? position4:D? position5:E? But we need position4 as L? Here position4 is D? Not L? Conflict? 

Similarly? ""tiled"": T I L E D? ends with ED? 

No? So words that have exactly: T X Y L E? 

Common ones: ""title"" might be the best? Or ""table"" has A? Absent? 

Another: ""bugle"" is B U G L E? U is absent? 

Or ""eagle"" has E and A? 

So ""title"" seems acceptable? 

But we have position3 as T? which we already know a T? But we are testing for duplicate? 

Alternatively? use ""time"" something? 

I think we have to use ""title"" or find another word? 

Another? ""tile"" with additional? None? 

Or ""stole"" already used? 

Perhaps ""thole"" but O absent? 

Or ""while""? W-H-I-L-E? Position3 is I? Not? Positions: W at1? H at2? I at3? L at4? E at5? So not T at1? 

We must have T at1? 

So a word starting with T? then ? ? ? then L E? 

If we use ""title""? Then we guess T I T L E? 

Feedback will tell us? 
- Position1 T: ✓ (confirmed)
- Position2 I: we need to know if I is present? And at which position? 
- Position3 T: if duplicate T? Then if secret has T at3? or not? 
- Position4 L: ✓ (confirmed)
- Position5 E: ✓ (confirmed)

We are interested in position2 I and position3 T? 

But since we know T is at position1? If secret has another T? Or not? 

If we get T at position3 marked x? Then no T at position3? So position3 must be something else? If T at position3 marked ✓? Then duplicate? Or -? Or x? It could be various? 

Perhaps better to avoid assuming duplicate T? So guess a word with two new letters at positions 2 and 3? 

For example? ""thumb""? Not ends with LE? 

""timed""? Ends with D? 

""tiger""? Ends with R? 

""tidal""? Ends with L? But position5 L? Not E? 

""tiger"" is T I G E R? Not LE? 

So how about ""tiler""? Too long? Ends with R? 

That's 5? But does not have E at the end? Position5 would be R? 

Not? 

""tills""? Ends with S? 

""tilde"" is not LE? 

Perhaps ""tizzy"" not E? 

I think we have to use ""title"" or similar? 

Another word: ""timer"" not LE? 

""timed"": T-I-M-E-D? Ends with D? 

Only options left: ""title"" or ""tithe"" with T-I-T-H-E? But then we put L at position4? Instead of H? 

We cannot change position4? Because L must be at position4? 

In our next guess? We must have L at position4 and E at position5? To keep known correct? 

So the guess must be: T ?? L E? With positions 1:T? 4:L? 5:E? and position 2 and 3 whatever? 

So only possible common word? ""title"" seems the only common word? 

Less common? ""thole"" O? Absent? O is eliminated? 

""twice"" ends with E? But not LE? 

""trace"" C absent? 

I think ""title"" is the best shot? 

So let's guess ""title""? 

If not? ""twill"" T W I L L? Ends with LL? Not LE? And position5 L? Not E? 

""twine"" ends with E? But not LE? 

So yes? ""title"" is acceptable. 

Guess ""title""? 

But what about the available vowels? We have I available? 

And it is a common vowel? 

So I think go for ""title"". 

Feedback will tell us about letter2 and whether T is duplicated? 

But we only care for position2 and3? 

Also? we have position2: I? and position3: T? 

From feedback? we can get:
- If the secret word has ""I"" at position2? And whether ""I"" is present or not? 
- And for position3 T: will help resolve if there is duplicate T? 

But if we can avoid T? Why not? 

But we can't find a word? 

Another word: ""tike"" not 5? 

""tiger"" 5? Ends with R? 

""times"" 5? Ends with S? 

But must end with E? 

""timed"" ends with D? 

""tiled"" is T I L E D? Which has L at position3? Then E at4? But we need L at4? So? 

Not possible? 

So I believe ""title"" is the only reasonable choice? 

Therefore? next guess: ""title""? 

But position3 is T? We have position1 T? So we are reusing T at position3. 

Feedback: for position3? if T is there? we will see? 

Let me accept that. 

<guess>title</guess> 

But thought process: 

We know secret word: T _ _ L E 

We guessed ""tuple"": so U and P absent? 

So positions 2 and 3 to be guessed? 

Let me list possible letters for position2 and position3: available letters? B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

Then we need a word that uses two of these? 

To maximize information? we should guess a word that uses common letters? 

But with T at1? L at4? E at5? 

Common choices? The only valid 5-letter word I can think of is ""title"" or ""thine""? But ""thine"": T H I N E? Ends with E? But position4 N? Not L? Conflict. 

""tithe"": T I T H E? Position4 H? Not L? 

""targe"" G? Position4 not L? 

All have problem? 

""title"" is T-I-T-L-E? Which matches T at1? L at4? E at5? 

So it's valid? and uses I at2? which is available? 

So we must guess ""title""? 

Perhaps others like ""tulle""? But T U L L E? and U is absent? 

U was eliminated in ""tuple"" feedback? U at2 x? so absent? cannot use? 

Similarly? P absent? 

So ""tulle"" also has U? Absent? So not. 

""belle"" starts with B? 

So no? 

Therefore? ""title"" is the guess.

### Thought Process

1. **Previous Feedback Analysis**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
     - E(✓) at position 5 means the secret word ends with E, and C/R/A/N are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (""stole"")**:
     - L(✓) at position 4 and E(✓) at position 5 confirm positions 4 (L) and 5 (E). T(-) means T is in the word but not at position 2. S and O are absent.
     - Therefore, the secret word format is _ _ _ L E, with T at position 1 or 3.
   - **Guess 3 (""tuple"")**:
     - T(✓) at position 1 confirms T starts the word. U(x) and P(x) mean U and P are absent. L(✓) and E(✓) reaffirm positions 4 and 5.
     - The secret word is now **T _ _ L E**.

2. **Absent Letters**: 
   - From all guesses: C, R, A, N, S, O, U, P are absent.
   - Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

3. **Current Secret Word State**:
   - Positions 1, 4, and 5 are known: T, L, E.
   - Positions 2 and 3 are unknown and must be filled from the remaining letter pool.
   - Possibility of duplicate letters? No feedback indicates duplicates, but it's possible for T, L, or E. However, avoiding duplicates simplifies testing new letters.

4. **Next Guess Strategy**:
   - Must retain known correct positions: T at 1, L at 4, E at 5.
   - Focus on positions 2 and 3 to test new letters efficiently.
   - Common vowels like I (since A, O, U are absent) and common consonants are prioritized.
   - ""Title"" is a valid word that fits the current constraints:  
     - Starts with T, ends with LE (positions 4-5).
     - Uses I at position 2 (untested vowel) and T at position 3 (tests for duplicate T).
     - Avoids absent letters.

5. **Why ""title""?**
   - Tests position 2 with I: If I is present, feedback shows (-) or (✓); if absent, shows (x).
   - Tests position 3 with T: If T is at position 3 (duplicate), gets (✓); otherwise, gets (x) if only one T is at position 1.
   - Eliminates/includes I and T duplication immediately.
   - Optimizes information with minimal risk: If I is absent, it's eliminated; if T duplication is true, it locks position 3.

<guess>title</guess>",title,"We have new feedback from guess 3 ""tuple"": T(✓) U(x) P(x) L(✓) E(✓)

Breaking down:
- T at position 1 is correct (so secret word starts with T).
- U at position 2 is not in the word (absent).
- P at position 3 is not in the word (absent).
- L at position 4 is correct (as before).
- E at position 5 is correct (as before).

Also, from previous feedback:
- E at position 5 (from guess 1).
- L at position 4 (from guess 2).
- T is in the word (from guess 2) and now confirmed at position 1 (from guess 3).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, S, O, U, P.

Since T is at position 1 and L at 4 and E at 5, the secret word is: T _ _ L E

We now know positions 1, 4, 5: T, L, E.

We need to figure out the letters for positions 2 and 3.

- From guess 1 and 2, we know letters that are absent.

Remaining possible letters: all letters not eliminated. Eliminated: C, R, A, N, S, O, U, P.

So possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: E, L, T are present but already used correctly, so if duplicated? But we don't know; we must be cautious.)

But we have positions 2 and 3 to fill.

In the secret word, position 2 and 3 must be from the remaining letters.

We know from guess 3 that U and P are absent? Therefore, we eliminate U and P.

Previous absents: C,R,A,N,S,O. Now adding U and P.

So total absent: C, R, A, N, S, O, U, P.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. And also consider that E, T, L are already placed? But they might be duplicated? However, we haven't been told about duplicates? So let me think: 

In guess 1 ""crane"": E was at position 5? But we don't know if other E are present? Similarly, in guess 2 ""stole"": L at 4? But not tested elsewhere? Similarly, T at 1? And in ""tuple"", T at1 and L&E? So we don't have information about duplicate T,L,E? 

Therefore, for positions 2 and 3? They could be any available letter? Could be any letter from the available set? Also, could be duplicates of T, L, or E? But E and T are only known to be at their positions? And L?

   - **Guess 2 (""stole"")**:
     - L(✓) at position 4 and E(✓) at position 5 confirm positions 4 (L) and 5 (E). T(-) means T is in the word but not at position 2. S and O are absent.
     - Therefore, the secret word format is _ _ _ L E, with T at position 1 or 3.
   - **Guess 3 (""tuple"")**:
     - T(✓) at position 1 confirms T starts the word. U(x) and P(x) mean U and P are absent. L(✓) and E(✓) reaffirm positions 4 and 5.
     - The secret word is now **T _ _ L E**.

2. **Absent Letters**: 
   - From all guesses: C, R, A, N, S, O, U, P are absent.
   - Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

3. **Current Secret Word State**:
   - Positions 1, 4, and 5 are known: T, L, E.
   - Positions 2 and 3 are unknown and must be filled from the remaining letter pool.
   - Possibility of duplicate letters? No feedback indicates duplicates, but it's possible for T, L, or E. However, avoiding duplicates simplifies testing new letters.

4. **Next Guess Strategy**:
   - Must retain known correct positions: T at 1, L at 4, E at 5.
   - Focus on positions 2 and 3 to test new letters efficiently.
   - Common vowels like I (since A, O, U are absent) and common consonants are prioritized.
   - ""Title"" is a valid word that fits the current constraints:  
     - Starts with T, ends with LE (positions 4-5).
     - Uses I at position 2 (untested vowel) and T at position 3 (tests for duplicate T).
     - Avoids absent letters.

5. **Why ""title""?**
   - Tests position 2 with I: If I is present, feedback shows (-) or (✓); if absent, shows (x).
   - Tests position 3 with T: If T is at position 3 (duplicate), gets (✓); otherwise, gets (x) if only one T is at position 1.
   - Eliminates/includes I and T duplication immediately.
   - Optimizes information with minimal risk: If I is absent, it's eliminated; if T duplication is true, it locks position 3.",Guess 4: title -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) I(✓) T(✓) L(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
