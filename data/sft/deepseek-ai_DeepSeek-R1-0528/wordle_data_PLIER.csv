We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word (x)
 - R is in the word but not in the correct position (-)
 - A is not in the word (x)
 - N is not in the word (x)
 - E is in the word but not in the correct position (-)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they appear in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

 Since we are making the second guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
 1. Includes R and E (because they are present in the secret word).
 2. Does not include C, A, or N.
 3. Places R in a position other than the second, and E in a position other than the fifth.

 Also, we should try to cover more common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that contain R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Possible vowels: We have E already, but we might need others (like I, O, U). Since A is out, we can try I or O.

 Common consonants besides R: S, T, L, etc.

 Example words: 
   ""ROUSE"": contains R, O, U, S, E -> but note the positions: R is first, E is fifth? 
     However, in our feedback, E is already known to not be fifth, so we cannot place E in the fifth position.

 Similarly, we must avoid placing R in the second position.

 Let's try to think of words with R and E, E not at the end, and R not at the second position.

 Alternatives:
   ""RESET"" -> But E is at positions 2 and 4? We don't know about multiple letters yet. Also, we might have duplicated letters?
   However, in the first guess the word had distinct letters, but the secret word might have duplicates.

 But note: in the feedback, we got two minuses for R and E, but we don't know if the secret word has multiple of these.

 Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. But we don't know.

 Since we are still early, it's better to try words without duplicates to get clearer information.

 However, let me check the rules: no mention if duplicates are allowed. Actually, Wordle does allow duplicated letters? 
 But typically, the secret word can have duplicate letters? Actually, the rules don't specify. But since the example didn't have duplicates, and in Wordle the secret word may have duplicates, but we must be cautious.

 Considering the feedback: if the same letter appears multiple times in the guess, then the feedback for that letter might be counted independently.

 However, to keep it simple for now, let's try to avoid duplicates.

 So, we need a word that:
   - Contains R and E (and three other letters not in {C, A, N})
   - R must not be in position 2 (but note: in our guess, position 2 is the second letter? Remember the indexing: guess was ""C R A N E"", so positions: 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E).
   - E must not be in position 5.

 And we want to maximize the possibility of covering new common letters.

 How about trying the letter O and T? 

 Consider ""ROUTE"": 
   R is at position 1 -> okay because in the first guess R was at position 2 and now we move it to 1? 
   But note: the feedback only said the secret word has R, so we can try any position except 2? Actually, we only avoid putting R at position 2? 
   What if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we would get a check.

   E is at position 5 -> but we know from feedback that E is not at position 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""ROUTE"" is not acceptable because E is at fifth.

 Another idea: ""STORE"" -> 
   positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)
   E at 5 -> invalid.

 We must avoid having E at fifth.

 How about ""STIRE""? That's not a word? 

 Let me think of words with E in the beginning or middle.

 Examples: 
   ""PERKY"": P E R K Y -> R at position 3 (was position 2 in first guess, so avoid that? Actually, we avoid position 2? But position 3 is new). 
   Also, E is at position 2.

 Conditions for positions:
   - R must not be in position 2 (according to feedback, because in the first guess it was at position 2 and we got '-', meaning correct letter but wrong position). 
     So we can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the secret word might have R at 2? Actually, no: because if the secret word had R at 2, then when we guessed R at 2, it would be a check (✓). 
     Since we got a minus, that means the secret word has an R at position 1,3,4, or 5? So let's avoid position 2.

   Similarly, E must not be at position 5? Actually, we got a minus for E at position 5? So in the secret word, E is at 1,2,3, or 4? So we avoid E at position 5.

 Also, we are avoiding the letters C, A, N.

 So, back to ""PERKY"": 
   P E R K Y -> positions: 
     1: P (new)
     2: E (now in second position -> we don't know if that's good? We can try)
     3: R (new position and not 2 -> good)
     4: K (new)
     5: Y (new)

 But is ""perky"" a valid word? Yes.

 However, let me consider if there's a better word.

 Another word: ""DRIVE"" -> 
   D R I V E
   R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we know R is not in position 2? So we must avoid putting R at 2.

 So ""DRIVE"" has R at 2 -> invalid for our purpose.

 Another: ""CRIER"" -> but C is not allowed? We avoid C.

 How about ""REMIT"": 
   R E M I T
   positions: R(1), E(2), M(3), I(4), T(5)
   E is at 2? Okay. R at 1? Okay. 
   But note: E is at position 2? We don't know if that's the right position? We might get a check or minus.

   Also, recall that we must avoid E at 5? Here E is at 2? So that's okay.

   But wait: what if E is in the secret word at a position other than 5? It might be at 2? We might get a check? Or if not, then minus.

   Let me see: the word ""REMIT"" seems valid? 

   But note: we have R at position 1? And we don't have any information about position 1? 

   However, we must avoid R at position 2? That's satisfied.

 Another: ""PRICE"" -> but P R I C E: C is not allowed? So invalid.

 Another: ""BRIDE"" -> B R I D E: R is at position 2? -> invalid because we must avoid R at 2.

 How about ""OWLER""? Not very common. 

 I think ""REMIT"" is a good candidate? But let's check common letters: R and E are already known, and we introduce M, I, T.

 Also, we can try ""TREND"": 
   T R E N D -> but N is forbidden? Because in first guess N was marked not present.

 Since we are avoiding N, we can't use ""TREND"".

 Another: ""PEDAL"" -> but A is forbidden? Because A was marked absent in the first guess.

 So, going back to ""PERKY"" and ""REMIT"", both are valid? 

 But note: ""PERKY"" has E at position 2, which we don't know about. Same for ""REMIT"" (R at 1, E at 2).

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts E at position other than 2 and 5? Like position 1, 3, or 4.

 Consider ""HELPS""? Not a 5-letter word? ""HELPS"" is only 5 letters? But H E L P S: E at 2? Still at 2? 

 How about ""EARTH"" -> avoid: E and A? A is forbidden.

 How about ""STERN"": 
   S T E R N -> forbidden N? So no.

 ""BIRSE"": meaning? It's a word? Let me avoid rare words.

 How about ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we avoid R in position 2.

 How about ""QUERY"": Q U E R Y -> E at 3? That's good. R at 4? Also good? Positions: 
   position1: Q -> uncommon? Maybe not the best.
   But we avoid R in 2? Yes, R is at 4? Good.
   E at 3: avoids position 5? Good.

 However, Q is uncommon and we might not cover common letters.

 Another: ""MERRY"" -> duplicate R? We try to avoid duplicates? Also, E at 2? 

 Let me think of ""GOURD"": doesn't have E? But we must include E.

 How about ""VERSE"": duplicate E? Also V E R S E -> E at position 2 and 5? But we cannot have E at 5? So if we have E in position 2 and 5, we avoid E at 5? Actually, the rule says: each letter independently? 
 But let's check: if we guess two E's, and the secret word has one E? Then one E might get a check (if in correct position) and the other might be absent? But the feedback rules: 

 ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols""

 And the example didn't cover duplicates? 

 However, to avoid complexity, I'll try a word without duplicates.

 So, consider ""ROGUE"": 
   R O G U E -> R at 1, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden? So invalid.

 Consider ""OILER"": 
   O I L E R -> E at 4? And R at 5? 
   Positions: 
      1: O
      2: I
      3: L
      4: E
      5: R -> but R is at the fifth? And we avoid R at 2? But fifth is okay? And E at 4? We avoid E at 5? Yes.

 So ""OILER"" is an option? But we don't know if that's common? And we skip some common letters? 

 Another: ""BRINE"": but N is forbidden? 

 We can also try ""HOMER"": 
   H O M E R -> E at 4? R at 5? 
   It includes E and R? And avoids forbidden letters? Yes.

 But note: O and M are new?

 However, let me compare: I want to test letters that are likely to be in the word? 

 We know: the word must have R and E? And avoid C, A, N. 

 Possible vowels: only E? or also others? Might be O, I, U? 

 Among the common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.

 Perhaps we can prioritize those?

 After reconsidering, I think ""STARE"" would have been a classic start? But we already started with ""CRANE"", so we have to adapt.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S T O L E -> E at 5 -> avoid E at 5? So invalid.

 ""STILE"": 
   S T I L E -> E at 5 -> avoid.

 Then ""STORE"" is invalid? 

 How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.

 Then ""SETTLE"" is 6 letters? 

 How about ""SPIRE"": 
   S P I R E -> positions: 
     1: S
     2: P
     3: I
     4: R -> R at position 4? (avoided position 2? yes)
     5: E -> avoid? because E cannot be at 5? So invalid.

 Then ""SPREE"": duplicate E? Also E at 5? 

 Let me try ""SPRUE"": not common.

 Given this, I am considering ""REMIT"" again? 

 Or ""PERCH"": but C is forbidden? 

 After some thought, I find ""RESTY"": 
   R E S T Y -> positions: 
     1: R -> R at position 1? (avoided position 2? yes)
     2: E -> E at 2? 
     3: S -> new
     4: T -> new
     5: Y -> new

 But note: E at 2? We don't know? And also, we are avoiding E at 5? But here E is at 2? So that's okay? But we need to avoid R at 2? Not violated.

 However, in the secret word E cannot be at 5? But we put E at 2? That's acceptable.

 But wait: what about the R? We are placing R at 1? We know from the previous feedback that R is in the word? But we don't know the position? So maybe if we put R at 1 we get a check? That would help.

 Similarly, if we get a minus for E at position 2, then we know E is not at 2? 

 Also, we cover S and T? which are common.

 So ""RESTY"" is a valid word? Yes? Meaning: given to rest? 

 But if not, how about ""RESET""? 
   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4? duplicate E? We avoid duplicates? 

 Let me avoid duplicates? And ""RESTY"" is a word.

 Alternative: ""TRUER"": duplicate R? 

 Or ""ROBES"": 
   R O B E S -> E at 4? So avoid E at 5? Okay? But R at 1, E at 4? 
   But S is also common? However, duplicate S? No? ROBES: positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5) -> all distinct.

 But E at 4? Okay.

 Also, we introduce O, B, S.

 After comparing: 
   ""RESTY"" = R E S T Y, distinct letters? Yes.

   ""ROBES"" = R O B E S, distinct.

 Both are good? 

 Also, ""TOWER"": 
   T O W E R -> E at 4? But R at 5? And R is repeated? Actually: T, O, W, E, R -> distinct? Yes? 
   But E at 4, R at 5? 

 Now, we have to decide:

 We want to maximize information? 

 In ""RESTY"", we have R and E? And test S, T, Y? 

 In ""ROBES"", we test O, B, S? 

 We already eliminated A, N? So perhaps both are equivalent? But Y is less common? So maybe ""ROBES"" is better? 

 Another: ""HOUSE"": 
   H O U S E -> E at 5 -> avoid.

 How about ""HORDE"": 
   H O R D E -> R at 3? E at 5 -> avoid E at 5.

 Difficult.

 After rethinking, I think I'll go with ""ROBES"" because it covers O and S? and avoids the fifth position for E.

 So guess: ""ROBES""

 But let me confirm: 
   Positions: 
     position1: R -> we are testing if R is at 1? 
     position2: O -> new
     position3: B -> new
     position4: E -> we are testing if E is at 4? 
     position5: S -> new

 And we avoid R at 2? Yes? O and B could be new letters? 

 However, an alternative word: ""SERUM"" -> 
   S E R U M -> 
     S at 1
     E at 2 -> test E at 2?
     R at 3 -> avoid R position 2? Yes? 
     U at 4? 
     M at 5?

 That is also a possibility? 

 But we have E at 2? and R at 3? 

 Comparing: 
   ""SERUM"": S, E, R, U, M
   ""ROBES"": R, O, B, E, S

 We already know the word has R and E? so both use that? 

 Then which letters do we want to cover? S is common? O is common? 
   SERUM uses U and M? ROBES uses O, B, S? 

 S is more common than M? So ""SERUM"" might be better? 

 But ""SERUM"" puts E at 2? In the first guess E was at 5? and now E at 2? 

 Also, note: in the secret word, E might be at 2? then we get a check? 

 However, we are free to test E at 2? 

 Ultimately, I'll choose ""SERUM""? 

 But let me see the letters: 
   By using ""SERUM"" we test: 
        S at 1 -> will it be check? 
        E at 2 -> 
        R at 3 -> note: we know R is not at 2? but R at 3 is new?
        U at 4? 
        M at 5?

 Then we can get information on S, E, R, U, M? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has the E in a position that we haven't guessed? For example, we had E at 5? Now we want to avoid E at 5? Also avoid E at 2? 

 How about position 1? 

 Consider ""ELVIS""? Not a word? 
 ""EARNS"" -> A forbidden? 
 ""EDGES"" -> duplicate E? 
 ""EGRET"" -> duplicate E? 

 How about ""ETHER""? 
   E T H E R -> duplicate E? 

 How about ""ENROL""? -> uses N? forbidden.

 Then I think it's difficult to avoid E at 2? 

 Actually, we know E is not at 5? And we don't have any information about other positions? So we can put E at any position except 5? 

 We have also to consider: if we put E at 1, then we test a new position? 

 Consider ""ENTRY"" -> N forbidden? 

 How about ""EMPTY"": 
   E M P T Y -> positions: 
     E at 1? Okay? M at 2? P at 3? T at 4? Y at 5? 
   But then we avoid R? Wait, we know the secret word has R? So we must include R? 

 Therefore, we cannot skip R? So the word must contain R? 

 Therefore, the word ""EMPTY"" doesn't contain R -> invalid because we know the secret word has R? 

 So the guess must include R and also E? 

 Therefore, for our second guess we must have R and E? and avoid C, A, N? 

 Conclusion: 
   We choose between ""ROBES"" and ""SERUM""? 

 After careful consideration, I'll choose ""SERUM"" because we have R at a position that we haven't tried (position 3) and we cover S, U, M? 

 Also, note that in ""SERUM"": 
   We avoid placing R at position 2 (it's at 3) and E at position 5? 

 So let's go with ""SERUM"". 

 I hope it's a valid word? Yes? 

 Another common word: ""PRIME""? 
   P R I M E -> but R at position 2 -> avoid? So we must avoid R at position 2? So ""PRIME"" has R at 2 -> invalid.

 Final decision: ""SERUM""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (symbol: x).
- R is in the word but **not** in position 2 (symbol: -).
- E is in the word but **not** in position 5 (symbol: -).

For the second guess:
- Must include R and E (as they are in the secret word).
- Must **avoid** C, A, and N.
- R cannot be placed in position 2.
- E cannot be placed in position 5.
- Prioritize covering new common consonants (e.g., S, T, M) and avoiding duplicates for clarity.

After considering words like ""ROBES"" and ""PERKY"", the word **""SERUM""** fits best:
- Places R in position 3 (new position, avoids position 2).
- Places E in position 2 (a position not yet tested).
- Introduces new letters: S, U, M (no C, A, or N).
- S at position 1, E at position 2, R at position 3, U at position 4, M at position 5—all distinct letters.

This guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while maximizing coverage of common letters.

<guess>serum</guess>",serum,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word (x)
 - R is in the word but not in the correct position (-)
 - A is not in the word (x)
 - N is not in the word (x)
 - E is in the word but not in the correct position (-)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they appear in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

 Since we are making the second guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
 1. Includes R and E (because they are present in the secret word).
 2. Does not include C, A, or N.
 3. Places R in a position other than the second, and E in a position other than the fifth.

 Also, we should try to cover more common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that contain R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Possible vowels: We have E already, but we might need others (like I, O, U). Since A is out, we can try I or O.

 Common consonants besides R: S, T, L, etc.

 Example words: 
   ""ROUSE"": contains R, O, U, S, E -> but note the positions: R is first, E is fifth? 
     However, in our feedback, E is already known to not be fifth, so we cannot place E in the fifth position.

 Similarly, we must avoid placing R in the second position.

 Let's try to think of words with R and E, E not at the end, and R not at the second position.

 Alternatives:
   ""RESET"" -> But E is at positions 2 and 4? We don't know about multiple letters yet. Also, we might have duplicated letters?
   However, in the first guess the word had distinct letters, but the secret word might have duplicates.

 But note: in the feedback, we got two minuses for R and E, but we don't know if the secret word has multiple of these.

 Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. But we don't know.

 Since we are still early, it's better to try words without duplicates to get clearer information.

 However, let me check the rules: no mention if duplicates are allowed. Actually, Wordle does allow duplicated letters? 
 But typically, the secret word can have duplicate letters? Actually, the rules don't specify. But since the example didn't have duplicates, and in Wordle the secret word may have duplicates, but we must be cautious.

 Considering the feedback: if the same letter appears multiple times in the guess, then the feedback for that letter might be counted independently.

 However, to keep it simple for now, let's try to avoid duplicates.

 So, we need a word that:
   - Contains R and E (and three other letters not in {C, A, N})
   - R must not be in position 2 (but note: in our guess, position 2 is the second letter? Remember the indexing: guess was ""C R A N E"", so positions: 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E).
   - E must not be in position 5.

 And we want to maximize the possibility of covering new common letters.

 How about trying the letter O and T? 

 Consider ""ROUTE"": 
   R is at position 1 -> okay because in the first guess R was at position 2 and now we move it to 1? 
   But note: the feedback only said the secret word has R, so we can try any position except 2? Actually, we only avoid putting R at position 2? 
   What if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we would get a check.

   E is at position 5 -> but we know from feedback that E is not at position 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""ROUTE"" is not acceptable because E is at fifth.

 Another idea: ""STORE"" -> 
   positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)
   E at 5 -> invalid.

 We must avoid having E at fifth.

 How about ""STIRE""? That's not a word? 

 Let me think of words with E in the beginning or middle.

 Examples: 
   ""PERKY"": P E R K Y -> R at position 3 (was position 2 in first guess, so avoid that? Actually, we avoid position 2? But position 3 is new). 
   Also, E is at position 2.

 Conditions for positions:
   - R must not be in position 2 (according to feedback, because in the first guess it was at position 2 and we got '-', meaning correct letter but wrong position). 
     So we can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the secret word might have R at 2? Actually, no: because if the secret word had R at 2, then when we guessed R at 2, it would be a check (✓). 
     Since we got a minus, that means the secret word has an R at position 1,3,4, or 5? So let's avoid position 2.

   Similarly, E must not be at position 5? Actually, we got a minus for E at position 5? So in the secret word, E is at 1,2,3, or 4? So we avoid E at position 5.

 Also, we are avoiding the letters C, A, N.

 So, back to ""PERKY"": 
   P E R K Y -> positions: 
     1: P (new)
     2: E (now in second position -> we don't know if that's good? We can try)
     3: R (new position and not 2 -> good)
     4: K (new)
     5: Y (new)

 But is ""perky"" a valid word? Yes.

 However, let me consider if there's a better word.

 Another word: ""DRIVE"" -> 
   D R I V E
   R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we know R is not in position 2? So we must avoid putting R at 2.

 So ""DRIVE"" has R at 2 -> invalid for our purpose.

 Another: ""CRIER"" -> but C is not allowed? We avoid C.

 How about ""REMIT"": 
   R E M I T
   positions: R(1), E(2), M(3), I(4), T(5)
   E is at 2? Okay. R at 1? Okay. 
   But note: E is at position 2? We don't know if that's the right position? We might get a check or minus.

   Also, recall that we must avoid E at 5? Here E is at 2? So that's okay.

   But wait: what if E is in the secret word at a position other than 5? It might be at 2? We might get a check? Or if not, then minus.

   Let me see: the word ""REMIT"" seems valid? 

   But note: we have R at position 1? And we don't have any information about position 1? 

   However, we must avoid R at position 2? That's satisfied.

 Another: ""PRICE"" -> but P R I C E: C is not allowed? So invalid.

 Another: ""BRIDE"" -> B R I D E: R is at position 2? -> invalid because we must avoid R at 2.

 How about ""OWLER""? Not very common. 

 I think ""REMIT"" is a good candidate? But let's check common letters: R and E are already known, and we introduce M, I, T.

 Also, we can try ""TREND"": 
   T R E N D -> but N is forbidden? Because in first guess N was marked not present.

 Since we are avoiding N, we can't use ""TREND"".

 Another: ""PEDAL"" -> but A is forbidden? Because A was marked absent in the first guess.

 So, going back to ""PERKY"" and ""REMIT"", both are valid? 

 But note: ""PERKY"" has E at position 2, which we don't know about. Same for ""REMIT"" (R at 1, E at 2).

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts E at position other than 2 and 5? Like position 1, 3, or 4.

 Consider ""HELPS""? Not a 5-letter word? ""HELPS"" is only 5 letters? But H E L P S: E at 2? Still at 2? 

 How about ""EARTH"" -> avoid: E and A? A is forbidden.

 How about ""STERN"": 
   S T E R N -> forbidden N? So no.

 ""BIRSE"": meaning? It's a word? Let me avoid rare words.

 How about ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we avoid R in position 2.

 How about ""QUERY"": Q U E R Y -> E at 3? That's good. R at 4? Also good? Positions: 
   position1: Q -> uncommon? Maybe not the best.
   But we avoid R in 2? Yes, R is at 4? Good.
   E at 3: avoids position 5? Good.

 However, Q is uncommon and we might not cover common letters.

 Another: ""MERRY"" -> duplicate R? We try to avoid duplicates? Also, E at 2? 

 Let me think of ""GOURD"": doesn't have E? But we must include E.

 How about ""VERSE"": duplicate E? Also V E R S E -> E at position 2 and 5? But we cannot have E at 5? So if we have E in position 2 and 5, we avoid E at 5? Actually, the rule says: each letter independently? 
 But let's check: if we guess two E's, and the secret word has one E? Then one E might get a check (if in correct position) and the other might be absent? But the feedback rules: 

 ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols""

 And the example didn't cover duplicates? 

 However, to avoid complexity, I'll try a word without duplicates.

 So, consider ""ROGUE"": 
   R O G U E -> R at 1, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden? So invalid.

 Consider ""OILER"": 
   O I L E R -> E at 4? And R at 5? 
   Positions: 
      1: O
      2: I
      3: L
      4: E
      5: R -> but R is at the fifth? And we avoid R at 2? But fifth is okay? And E at 4? We avoid E at 5? Yes.

 So ""OILER"" is an option? But we don't know if that's common? And we skip some common letters? 

 Another: ""BRINE"": but N is forbidden? 

 We can also try ""HOMER"": 
   H O M E R -> E at 4? R at 5? 
   It includes E and R? And avoids forbidden letters? Yes.

 But note: O and M are new?

 However, let me compare: I want to test letters that are likely to be in the word? 

 We know: the word must have R and E? And avoid C, A, N. 

 Possible vowels: only E? or also others? Might be O, I, U? 

 Among the common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.

 Perhaps we can prioritize those?

 After reconsidering, I think ""STARE"" would have been a classic start? But we already started with ""CRANE"", so we have to adapt.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S T O L E -> E at 5 -> avoid E at 5? So invalid.

 ""STILE"": 
   S T I L E -> E at 5 -> avoid.

 Then ""STORE"" is invalid? 

 How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.

 Then ""SETTLE"" is 6 letters? 

 How about ""SPIRE"": 
   S P I R E -> positions: 
     1: S
     2: P
     3: I
     4: R -> R at position 4? (avoided position 2? yes)
     5: E -> avoid? because E cannot be at 5? So invalid.

 Then ""SPREE"": duplicate E? Also E at 5? 

 Let me try ""SPRUE"": not common.

 Given this, I am considering ""REMIT"" again? 

 Or ""PERCH"": but C is forbidden? 

 After some thought, I find ""RESTY"": 
   R E S T Y -> positions: 
     1: R -> R at position 1? (avoided position 2? yes)
     2: E -> E at 2? 
     3: S -> new
     4: T -> new
     5: Y -> new

 But note: E at 2? We don't know? And also, we are avoiding E at 5? But here E is at 2? So that's okay? But we need to avoid R at 2? Not violated.

 However, in the secret word E cannot be at 5? But we put E at 2? That's acceptable.

 But wait: what about the R? We are placing R at 1? We know from the previous feedback that R is in the word? But we don't know the position? So maybe if we put R at 1 we get a check? That would help.

 Similarly, if we get a minus for E at position 2, then we know E is not at 2? 

 Also, we cover S and T? which are common.

 So ""RESTY"" is a valid word? Yes? Meaning: given to rest? 

 But if not, how about ""RESET""? 
   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4? duplicate E? We avoid duplicates? 

 Let me avoid duplicates? And ""RESTY"" is a word.

 Alternative: ""TRUER"": duplicate R? 

 Or ""ROBES"": 
   R O B E S -> E at 4? So avoid E at 5? Okay? But R at 1, E at 4? 
   But S is also common? However, duplicate S? No? ROBES: positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5) -> all distinct.

 But E at 4? Okay.

 Also, we introduce O, B, S.

 After comparing: 
   ""RESTY"" = R E S T Y, distinct letters? Yes.

   ""ROBES"" = R O B E S, distinct.

 Both are good? 

 Also, ""TOWER"": 
   T O W E R -> E at 4? But R at 5? And R is repeated? Actually: T, O, W, E, R -> distinct? Yes? 
   But E at 4, R at 5? 

 Now, we have to decide:

 We want to maximize information? 

 In ""RESTY"", we have R and E? And test S, T, Y? 

 In ""ROBES"", we test O, B, S? 

 We already eliminated A, N? So perhaps both are equivalent? But Y is less common? So maybe ""ROBES"" is better? 

 Another: ""HOUSE"": 
   H O U S E -> E at 5 -> avoid.

 How about ""HORDE"": 
   H O R D E -> R at 3? E at 5 -> avoid E at 5.

 Difficult.

 After rethinking, I think I'll go with ""ROBES"" because it covers O and S? and avoids the fifth position for E.

 So guess: ""ROBES""

 But let me confirm: 
   Positions: 
     position1: R -> we are testing if R is at 1? 
     position2: O -> new
     position3: B -> new
     position4: E -> we are testing if E is at 4? 
     position5: S -> new

 And we avoid R at 2? Yes? O and B could be new letters? 

 However, an alternative word: ""SERUM"" -> 
   S E R U M -> 
     S at 1
     E at 2 -> test E at 2?
     R at 3 -> avoid R position 2? Yes? 
     U at 4? 
     M at 5?

 That is also a possibility? 

 But we have E at 2? and R at 3? 

 Comparing: 
   ""SERUM"": S, E, R, U, M
   ""ROBES"": R, O, B, E, S

 We already know the word has R and E? so both use that? 

 Then which letters do we want to cover? S is common? O is common? 
   SERUM uses U and M? ROBES uses O, B, S? 

 S is more common than M? So ""SERUM"" might be better? 

 But ""SERUM"" puts E at 2? In the first guess E was at 5? and now E at 2? 

 Also, note: in the secret word, E might be at 2? then we get a check? 

 However, we are free to test E at 2? 

 Ultimately, I'll choose ""SERUM""? 

 But let me see the letters: 
   By using ""SERUM"" we test: 
        S at 1 -> will it be check? 
        E at 2 -> 
        R at 3 -> note: we know R is not at 2? but R at 3 is new?
        U at 4? 
        M at 5?

 Then we can get information on S, E, R, U, M? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has the E in a position that we haven't guessed? For example, we had E at 5? Now we want to avoid E at 5? Also avoid E at 2? 

 How about position 1? 

 Consider ""ELVIS""? Not a word? 
 ""EARNS"" -> A forbidden? 
 ""EDGES"" -> duplicate E? 
 ""EGRET"" -> duplicate E? 

 How about ""ETHER""? 
   E T H E R -> duplicate E? 

 How about ""ENROL""? -> uses N? forbidden.

 Then I think it's difficult to avoid E at 2? 

 Actually, we know E is not at 5? And we don't have any information about other positions? So we can put E at any position except 5? 

 We have also to consider: if we put E at 1, then we test a new position? 

 Consider ""ENTRY"" -> N forbidden? 

 How about ""EMPTY"": 
   E M P T Y -> positions: 
     E at 1? Okay? M at 2? P at 3? T at 4? Y at 5? 
   But then we avoid R? Wait, we know the secret word has R? So we must include R? 

 Therefore, we cannot skip R? So the word must contain R? 

 Therefore, the word ""EMPTY"" doesn't contain R -> invalid because we know the secret word has R? 

 So the guess must include R and also E? 

 Therefore, for our second guess we must have R and E? and avoid C, A, N? 

 Conclusion: 
   We choose between ""ROBES"" and ""SERUM""? 

 After careful consideration, I'll choose ""SERUM"" because we have R at a position that we haven't tried (position 3) and we cover S, U, M? 

 Also, note that in ""SERUM"": 
   We avoid placing R at position 2 (it's at 3) and E at position 5? 

 So let's go with ""SERUM"". 

 I hope it's a valid word? Yes? 

 Another common word: ""PRIME""? 
   P R I M E -> but R at position 2 -> avoid? So we must avoid R at position 2? So ""PRIME"" has R at 2 -> invalid.

 Final decision: ""SERUM""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (symbol: x).
- R is in the word but **not** in position 2 (symbol: -).
- E is in the word but **not** in position 5 (symbol: -).

For the second guess:
- Must include R and E (as they are in the secret word).
- Must **avoid** C, A, and N.
- R cannot be placed in position 2.
- E cannot be placed in position 5.
- Prioritize covering new common consonants (e.g., S, T, M) and avoiding duplicates for clarity.

After considering words like ""ROBES"" and ""PERKY"", the word **""SERUM""** fits best:
- Places R in position 3 (new position, avoids position 2).
- Places E in position 2 (a position not yet tested).
- Introduces new letters: S, U, M (no C, A, or N).
- S at position 1, E at position 2, R at position 3, U at position 4, M at position 5—all distinct letters.

This guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while maximizing coverage of common letters.",Guess 2: serum -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,PLIER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word (x)
 - R is in the word but not in the correct position (-)
 - A is not in the word (x)
 - N is not in the word (x)
 - E is in the word but not in the correct position (-)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they appear in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

 Since we are making the second guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
 1. Includes R and E (because they are present in the secret word).
 2. Does not include C, A, or N.
 3. Places R in a position other than the second, and E in a position other than the fifth.

 Also, we should try to cover more common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that contain R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Possible vowels: We have E already, but we might need others (like I, O, U). Since A is out, we can try I or O.

 Common consonants besides R: S, T, L, etc.

 Example words: 
   ""ROUSE"": contains R, O, U, S, E -> but note the positions: R is first, E is fifth? 
     However, in our feedback, E is already known to not be fifth, so we cannot place E in the fifth position.

 Similarly, we must avoid placing R in the second position.

 Let's try to think of words with R and E, E not at the end, and R not at the second position.

 Alternatives:
   ""RESET"" -> But E is at positions 2 and 4? We don't know about multiple letters yet. Also, we might have duplicated letters?
   However, in the first guess the word had distinct letters, but the secret word might have duplicates.

 But note: in the feedback, we got two minuses for R and E, but we don't know if the secret word has multiple of these.

 Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. But we don't know.

 Since we are still early, it's better to try words without duplicates to get clearer information.

 However, let me check the rules: no mention if duplicates are allowed. Actually, Wordle does allow duplicated letters? 
 But typically, the secret word can have duplicate letters? Actually, the rules don't specify. But since the example didn't have duplicates, and in Wordle the secret word may have duplicates, but we must be cautious.

 Considering the feedback: if the same letter appears multiple times in the guess, then the feedback for that letter might be counted independently.

 However, to keep it simple for now, let's try to avoid duplicates.

 So, we need a word that:
   - Contains R and E (and three other letters not in {C, A, N})
   - R must not be in position 2 (but note: in our guess, position 2 is the second letter? Remember the indexing: guess was ""C R A N E"", so positions: 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E).
   - E must not be in position 5.

 And we want to maximize the possibility of covering new common letters.

 How about trying the letter O and T? 

 Consider ""ROUTE"": 
   R is at position 1 -> okay because in the first guess R was at position 2 and now we move it to 1? 
   But note: the feedback only said the secret word has R, so we can try any position except 2? Actually, we only avoid putting R at position 2? 
   What if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we would get a check.

   E is at position 5 -> but we know from feedback that E is not at position 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""ROUTE"" is not acceptable because E is at fifth.

 Another idea: ""STORE"" -> 
   positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)
   E at 5 -> invalid.

 We must avoid having E at fifth.

 How about ""STIRE""? That's not a word? 

 Let me think of words with E in the beginning or middle.

 Examples: 
   ""PERKY"": P E R K Y -> R at position 3 (was position 2 in first guess, so avoid that? Actually, we avoid position 2? But position 3 is new). 
   Also, E is at position 2.

 Conditions for positions:
   - R must not be in position 2 (according to feedback, because in the first guess it was at position 2 and we got '-', meaning correct letter but wrong position). 
     So we can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the secret word might have R at 2? Actually, no: because if the secret word had R at 2, then when we guessed R at 2, it would be a check (✓). 
     Since we got a minus, that means the secret word has an R at position 1,3,4, or 5? So let's avoid position 2.

   Similarly, E must not be at position 5? Actually, we got a minus for E at position 5? So in the secret word, E is at 1,2,3, or 4? So we avoid E at position 5.

 Also, we are avoiding the letters C, A, N.

 So, back to ""PERKY"": 
   P E R K Y -> positions: 
     1: P (new)
     2: E (now in second position -> we don't know if that's good? We can try)
     3: R (new position and not 2 -> good)
     4: K (new)
     5: Y (new)

 But is ""perky"" a valid word? Yes.

 However, let me consider if there's a better word.

 Another word: ""DRIVE"" -> 
   D R I V E
   R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we know R is not in position 2? So we must avoid putting R at 2.

 So ""DRIVE"" has R at 2 -> invalid for our purpose.

 Another: ""CRIER"" -> but C is not allowed? We avoid C.

 How about ""REMIT"": 
   R E M I T
   positions: R(1), E(2), M(3), I(4), T(5)
   E is at 2? Okay. R at 1? Okay. 
   But note: E is at position 2? We don't know if that's the right position? We might get a check or minus.

   Also, recall that we must avoid E at 5? Here E is at 2? So that's okay.

   But wait: what if E is in the secret word at a position other than 5? It might be at 2? We might get a check? Or if not, then minus.

   Let me see: the word ""REMIT"" seems valid? 

   But note: we have R at position 1? And we don't have any information about position 1? 

   However, we must avoid R at position 2? That's satisfied.

 Another: ""PRICE"" -> but P R I C E: C is not allowed? So invalid.

 Another: ""BRIDE"" -> B R I D E: R is at position 2? -> invalid because we must avoid R at 2.

 How about ""OWLER""? Not very common. 

 I think ""REMIT"" is a good candidate? But let's check common letters: R and E are already known, and we introduce M, I, T.

 Also, we can try ""TREND"": 
   T R E N D -> but N is forbidden? Because in first guess N was marked not present.

 Since we are avoiding N, we can't use ""TREND"".

 Another: ""PEDAL"" -> but A is forbidden? Because A was marked absent in the first guess.

 So, going back to ""PERKY"" and ""REMIT"", both are valid? 

 But note: ""PERKY"" has E at position 2, which we don't know about. Same for ""REMIT"" (R at 1, E at 2).

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts E at position other than 2 and 5? Like position 1, 3, or 4.

 Consider ""HELPS""? Not a 5-letter word? ""HELPS"" is only 5 letters? But H E L P S: E at 2? Still at 2? 

 How about ""EARTH"" -> avoid: E and A? A is forbidden.

 How about ""STERN"": 
   S T E R N -> forbidden N? So no.

 ""BIRSE"": meaning? It's a word? Let me avoid rare words.

 How about ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we avoid R in position 2.

 How about ""QUERY"": Q U E R Y -> E at 3? That's good. R at 4? Also good? Positions: 
   position1: Q -> uncommon? Maybe not the best.
   But we avoid R in 2? Yes, R is at 4? Good.
   E at 3: avoids position 5? Good.

 However, Q is uncommon and we might not cover common letters.

 Another: ""MERRY"" -> duplicate R? We try to avoid duplicates? Also, E at 2? 

 Let me think of ""GOURD"": doesn't have E? But we must include E.

 How about ""VERSE"": duplicate E? Also V E R S E -> E at position 2 and 5? But we cannot have E at 5? So if we have E in position 2 and 5, we avoid E at 5? Actually, the rule says: each letter independently? 
 But let's check: if we guess two E's, and the secret word has one E? Then one E might get a check (if in correct position) and the other might be absent? But the feedback rules: 

 ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols""

 And the example didn't cover duplicates? 

 However, to avoid complexity, I'll try a word without duplicates.

 So, consider ""ROGUE"": 
   R O G U E -> R at 1, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden? So invalid.

 Consider ""OILER"": 
   O I L E R -> E at 4? And R at 5? 
   Positions: 
      1: O
      2: I
      3: L
      4: E
      5: R -> but R is at the fifth? And we avoid R at 2? But fifth is okay? And E at 4? We avoid E at 5? Yes.

 So ""OILER"" is an option? But we don't know if that's common? And we skip some common letters? 

 Another: ""BRINE"": but N is forbidden? 

 We can also try ""HOMER"": 
   H O M E R -> E at 4? R at 5? 
   It includes E and R? And avoids forbidden letters? Yes.

 But note: O and M are new?

 However, let me compare: I want to test letters that are likely to be in the word? 

 We know: the word must have R and E? And avoid C, A, N. 

 Possible vowels: only E? or also others? Might be O, I, U? 

 Among the common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.

 Perhaps we can prioritize those?

 After reconsidering, I think ""STARE"" would have been a classic start? But we already started with ""CRANE"", so we have to adapt.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S T O L E -> E at 5 -> avoid E at 5? So invalid.

 ""STILE"": 
   S T I L E -> E at 5 -> avoid.

 Then ""STORE"" is invalid? 

 How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.

 Then ""SETTLE"" is 6 letters? 

 How about ""SPIRE"": 
   S P I R E -> positions: 
     1: S
     2: P
     3: I
     4: R -> R at position 4? (avoided position 2? yes)
     5: E -> avoid? because E cannot be at 5? So invalid.

 Then ""SPREE"": duplicate E? Also E at 5? 

 Let me try ""SPRUE"": not common.

 Given this, I am considering ""REMIT"" again? 

 Or ""PERCH"": but C is forbidden? 

 After some thought, I find ""RESTY"": 
   R E S T Y -> positions: 
     1: R -> R at position 1? (avoided position 2? yes)
     2: E -> E at 2? 
     3: S -> new
     4: T -> new
     5: Y -> new

 But note: E at 2? We don't know? And also, we are avoiding E at 5? But here E is at 2? So that's okay? But we need to avoid R at 2? Not violated.

 However, in the secret word E cannot be at 5? But we put E at 2? That's acceptable.

 But wait: what about the R? We are placing R at 1? We know from the previous feedback that R is in the word? But we don't know the position? So maybe if we put R at 1 we get a check? That would help.

 Similarly, if we get a minus for E at position 2, then we know E is not at 2? 

 Also, we cover S and T? which are common.

 So ""RESTY"" is a valid word? Yes? Meaning: given to rest? 

 But if not, how about ""RESET""? 
   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4? duplicate E? We avoid duplicates? 

 Let me avoid duplicates? And ""RESTY"" is a word.

 Alternative: ""TRUER"": duplicate R? 

 Or ""ROBES"": 
   R O B E S -> E at 4? So avoid E at 5? Okay? But R at 1, E at 4? 
   But S is also common? However, duplicate S? No? ROBES: positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5) -> all distinct.

 But E at 4? Okay.

 Also, we introduce O, B, S.

 After comparing: 
   ""RESTY"" = R E S T Y, distinct letters? Yes.

   ""ROBES"" = R O B E S, distinct.

 Both are good? 

 Also, ""TOWER"": 
   T O W E R -> E at 4? But R at 5? And R is repeated? Actually: T, O, W, E, R -> distinct? Yes? 
   But E at 4, R at 5? 

 Now, we have to decide:

 We want to maximize information? 

 In ""RESTY"", we have R and E? And test S, T, Y? 

 In ""ROBES"", we test O, B, S? 

 We already eliminated A, N? So perhaps both are equivalent? But Y is less common? So maybe ""ROBES"" is better? 

 Another: ""HOUSE"": 
   H O U S E -> E at 5 -> avoid.

 How about ""HORDE"": 
   H O R D E -> R at 3? E at 5 -> avoid E at 5.

 Difficult.

 After rethinking, I think I'll go with ""ROBES"" because it covers O and S? and avoids the fifth position for E.

 So guess: ""ROBES""

 But let me confirm: 
   Positions: 
     position1: R -> we are testing if R is at 1? 
     position2: O -> new
     position3: B -> new
     position4: E -> we are testing if E is at 4? 
     position5: S -> new

 And we avoid R at 2? Yes? O and B could be new letters? 

 However, an alternative word: ""SERUM"" -> 
   S E R U M -> 
     S at 1
     E at 2 -> test E at 2?
     R at 3 -> avoid R position 2? Yes? 
     U at 4? 
     M at 5?

 That is also a possibility? 

 But we have E at 2? and R at 3? 

 Comparing: 
   ""SERUM"": S, E, R, U, M
   ""ROBES"": R, O, B, E, S

 We already know the word has R and E? so both use that? 

 Then which letters do we want to cover? S is common? O is common? 
   SERUM uses U and M? ROBES uses O, B, S? 

 S is more common than M? So ""SERUM"" might be better? 

 But ""SERUM"" puts E at 2? In the first guess E was at 5? and now E at 2? 

 Also, note: in the secret word, E might be at 2? then we get a check? 

 However, we are free to test E at 2? 

 Ultimately, I'll choose ""SERUM""? 

 But let me see the letters: 
   By using ""SERUM"" we test: 
        S at 1 -> will it be check? 
        E at 2 -> 
        R at 3 -> note: we know R is not at 2? but R at 3 is new?
        U at 4? 
        M at 5?

 Then we can get information on S, E, R, U, M? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has the E in a position that we haven't guessed? For example, we had E at 5? Now we want to avoid E at 5? Also avoid E at 2? 

 How about position 1? 

 Consider ""ELVIS""? Not a word? 
 ""EARNS"" -> A forbidden? 
 ""EDGES"" -> duplicate E? 
 ""EGRET"" -> duplicate E? 

 How about ""ETHER""? 
   E T H E R -> duplicate E? 

 How about ""ENROL""? -> uses N? forbidden.

 Then I think it's difficult to avoid E at 2? 

 Actually, we know E is not at 5? And we don't have any information about other positions? So we can put E at any position except 5? 

 We have also to consider: if we put E at 1, then we test a new position? 

 Consider ""ENTRY"" -> N forbidden? 

 How about ""EMPTY"": 
   E M P T Y -> positions: 
     E at 1? Okay? M at 2? P at 3? T at 4? Y at 5? 
   But then we avoid R? Wait, we know the secret word has R? So we must include R? 

 Therefore, we cannot skip R? So the word must contain R? 

 Therefore, the word ""EMPTY"" doesn't contain R -> invalid because we know the secret word has R? 

 So the guess must include R and also E? 

 Therefore, for our second guess we must have R and E? and avoid C, A, N? 

 Conclusion: 
   We choose between ""ROBES"" and ""SERUM""? 

 After careful consideration, I'll choose ""SERUM"" because we have R at a position that we haven't tried (position 3) and we cover S, U, M? 

 Also, note that in ""SERUM"": 
   We avoid placing R at position 2 (it's at 3) and E at position 5? 

 So let's go with ""SERUM"". 

 I hope it's a valid word? Yes? 

 Another common word: ""PRIME""? 
   P R I M E -> but R at position 2 -> avoid? So we must avoid R at position 2? So ""PRIME"" has R at 2 -> invalid.

 Final decision: ""SERUM""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (symbol: x).
- R is in the word but **not** in position 2 (symbol: -).
- E is in the word but **not** in position 5 (symbol: -).

For the second guess:
- Must include R and E (as they are in the secret word).
- Must **avoid** C, A, and N.
- R cannot be placed in position 2.
- E cannot be placed in position 5.
- Prioritize covering new common consonants (e.g., S, T, M) and avoiding duplicates for clarity.

After considering words like ""ROBES"" and ""PERKY"", the word **""SERUM""** fits best:
- Places R in position 3 (new position, avoids position 2).
- Places E in position 2 (a position not yet tested).
- Introduces new letters: S, U, M (no C, A, or N).
- S at position 1, E at position 2, R at position 3, U at position 4, M at position 5—all distinct letters.

This guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while maximizing coverage of common letters.

Places R in a position other than the second, and E in a position other than the fifth.\n\n Also, we should try to cover more common letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of words that contain R and E, and avoid C, A, N.\n\n Possible vowels: We have E already, but we might need others (like I, O, U). Since A is out, we can try I or O.\n\n Common consonants besides R: S, T, L, etc.\n\n Example words: \n   ""ROUSE"": contains R, O, U, S, E -> but note the positions: R is first, E is fifth? \n     However, in our feedback, E is already known to not be fifth, so we cannot place E in the fifth position.\n\n Similarly, we must avoid placing R in the second position.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words with R and E, E not at the end, and R not at the second position.\n\n Alternatives:\n   ""RESET"" -> But E is at positions 2 and 4? We don\'t know about multiple letters yet. Also, we might have duplicated letters?\n   However, in the first guess the word had distinct letters, but the secret word might have duplicates.\n\n But note: in the feedback, we got two minuses for R and E, but we don\'t know if the secret word has multiple of these.\n\n Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. But we don\'t know.\n\n Since we are still early, it\'s better to try words without duplicates to get clearer information.\n\n However, let me check the rules: no mention if duplicates are allowed. Actually, Wordle does allow duplicated letters? \n But typically, the secret word can have duplicate letters? Actually, the rules don\'t specify. But since the example didn\'t have duplicates, and in Wordle the secret word may have duplicates, but we must be cautious.\n\n Considering the feedback: if the same letter appears multiple times in the guess, then the feedback for that letter might be counted independently.\n\n However, to keep it simple for now, let\'s try to avoid duplicates.\n\n So, we need a word that:\n   - Contains R and E (and three other letters not in {C, A, N})\n   - R must not be in position 2 (but note: in our guess, position 2 is the second letter? Remember the indexing: guess was ""C R A N E"", so positions: 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E).\n   - E must not be in position 5.\n\n And we want to maximize the possibility of covering new common letters.\n\n How about trying the letter O and T? \n\n Consider ""ROUTE"": \n   R is at position 1 -> okay because in the first guess R was at position 2 and now we move it to 1? \n   But note: the feedback only said the secret word has R, so we can try any position except 2? Actually, we only avoid putting R at position 2? \n   What if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we would get a check.\n\n   E is at position 5 -> but we know from feedback that E is not at position 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at position 5.\n\n Therefore, ""ROUTE"" is not acceptable because E is at fifth.\n\n Another idea: ""STORE"" -> \n   positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)\n   E at 5 -> invalid.\n\n We must avoid having E at fifth.\n\n How about ""STIRE""? That\'s not a word? \n\n Let me think of words with E in the beginning or middle.\n\n Examples: \n   ""PERKY"": P E R K Y -> R at position 3 (was position 2 in first guess, so avoid that? Actually, we avoid position 2? But position 3 is new). \n   Also, E is at position 2.\n\n Conditions for positions:\n   - R must not be in position 2 (according to feedback, because in the first guess it was at position 2 and we got \'-\', meaning correct letter but wrong position). \n     So we can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the secret word might have R at 2? Actually, no: because if the secret word had R at 2, then when we guessed R at 2, it would be a check (✓). \n     Since we got a minus, that means the secret word has an R at position 1,3,4, or 5? So let\'s avoid position 2.\n\n   Similarly, E must not be at position 5? Actually, we got a minus for E at position 5? So in the secret word, E is at 1,2,3, or 4? So we avoid E at position 5.\n\n Also, we are avoiding the letters C, A, N.\n\n So, back to ""PERKY"": \n   P E R K Y -> positions: \n     1: P (new)\n     2: E (now in second position -> we don\'t know if that\'s good? We can try)\n     3: R (new position and not 2 -> good)\n     4: K (new)\n     5: Y (new)\n\n But is ""perky"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n However, let me consider if there\'s a better word.\n\n Another word: ""DRIVE"" -> \n   D R I V E\n   R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we know R is not in position 2? So we must avoid putting R at 2.\n\n So ""DRIVE"" has R at 2 -> invalid for our purpose.\n\n Another: ""CRIER"" -> but C is not allowed? We avoid C.\n\n How about ""REMIT"": \n   R E M I T\n   positions: R(1), E(2), M(3), I(4), T(5)\n   E is at 2? Okay. R at 1? Okay. \n   But note: E is at position 2? We don\'t know if that\'s the right position? We might get a check or minus.\n\n   Also, recall that we must avoid E at 5? Here E is at 2? So that\'s okay.\n\n   But wait: what if E is in the secret word at a position other than 5? It might be at 2? We might get a check? Or if not, then minus.\n\n   Let me see: the word ""REMIT"" seems valid? \n\n   But note: we have R at position 1? And we don\'t have any information about position 1? \n\n   However, we must avoid R at position 2? That\'s satisfied.\n\n Another: ""PRICE"" -> but P R I C E: C is not allowed? So invalid.\n\n Another: ""BRIDE"" -> B R I D E: R is at position 2? -> invalid because we must avoid R at 2.\n\n How about ""OWLER""? Not very common. \n\n I think ""REMIT"" is a good candidate? But let\'s check common letters: R and E are already known, and we introduce M, I, T.\n\n Also, we can try ""TREND"": \n   T R E N D -> but N is forbidden? Because in first guess N was marked not present.\n\n Since we are avoiding N, we can\'t use ""TREND"".\n\n Another: ""PEDAL"" -> but A is forbidden? Because A was marked absent in the first guess.\n\n So, going back to ""PERKY"" and ""REMIT"", both are valid? \n\n But note: ""PERKY"" has E at position 2, which we don\'t know about. Same for ""REMIT"" (R at 1, E at 2).\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that puts E at position other than 2 and 5? Like position 1, 3, or 4.\n\n Consider ""HELPS""? Not a 5-letter word? ""HELPS"" is only 5 letters? But H E L P S: E at 2? Still at 2? \n\n How about ""EARTH"" -> avoid: E and A? A is forbidden.\n\n How about ""STERN"": \n   S T E R N -> forbidden N? So no.\n\n ""BIRSE"": meaning? It\'s a word? Let me avoid rare words.\n\n How about ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we avoid R in position 2.\n\n How about ""QUERY"": Q U E R Y -> E at 3? That\'s good. R at 4? Also good? Positions: \n   position1: Q -> uncommon? Maybe not the best.\n   But we avoid R in 2? Yes, R is at 4? Good.\n   E at 3: avoids position 5? Good.\n\n However, Q is uncommon and we might not cover common letters.\n\n Another: ""MERRY"" -> duplicate R? We try to avoid duplicates? Also, E at 2? \n\n Let me think of ""GOURD"": doesn\'t have E? But we must include E.\n\n How about ""VERSE"": duplicate E? Also V E R S E -> E at position 2 and 5? But we cannot have E at 5? So if we have E in position 2 and 5, we avoid E at 5? Actually, the rule says: each letter independently? \n But let\'s check: if we guess two E\'s, and the secret word has one E? Then one E might get a check (if in correct position) and the other might be absent? But the feedback rules: \n\n ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols""\n\n And the example didn\'t cover duplicates? \n\n However, to avoid complexity, I\'ll try a word without duplicates.\n\n So, consider ""ROGUE"": \n   R O G U E -> R at 1, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden? So invalid.\n\n Consider ""OILER"": \n   O I L E R -> E at 4? And R at 5? \n   Positions: \n      1: O\n      2: I\n      3: L\n      4: E\n      5: R -> but R is at the fifth? And we avoid R at 2? But fifth is okay? And E at 4? We avoid E at 5? Yes.\n\n So ""OILER"" is an option? But we don\'t know if that\'s common? And we skip some common letters? \n\n Another: ""BRINE"": but N is forbidden? \n\n We can also try ""HOMER"": \n   H O M E R -> E at 4? R at 5? \n   It includes E and R? And avoids forbidden letters? Yes.\n\n But note: O and M are new?\n\n However, let me compare: I want to test letters that are likely to be in the word? \n\n We know: the word must have R and E? And avoid C, A, N. \n\n Possible vowels: only E? or also others? Might be O, I, U? \n\n Among the common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.\n\n Perhaps we can prioritize those?\n\n After reconsidering, I think ""STARE"" would have been a classic start? But we already started with ""CRANE"", so we have to adapt.\n\n How about ""STOLE"": \n   S T O L E -> E at 5 -> avoid E at 5? So invalid.\n\n ""STILE"": \n   S T I L E -> E at 5 -> avoid.\n\n Then ""STORE"" is invalid? \n\n How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.\n\n Then ""SETTLE"" is 6 letters? \n\n How about ""SPIRE"": \n   S P I R E -> positions: \n     1: S\n     2: P\n     3: I\n     4: R -> R at position 4?

However, duplicate S? No? ROBES: positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5) -> all distinct.\n\n But E at 4? Okay.\n\n Also, we introduce O, B, S.\n\n After comparing: \n   ""RESTY"" = R E S T Y, distinct letters? Yes.\n\n   ""ROBES"" = R O B E S, distinct.\n\n Both are good? \n\n Also, ""TOWER"": \n   T O W E R -> E at 4? But R at 5? And R is repeated? Actually: T, O, W, E, R -> distinct? Yes? \n   But E at 4, R at 5? \n\n Now, we have to decide:\n\n We want to maximize information? \n\n In ""RESTY"", we have R and E? And test S, T, Y? \n\n In ""ROBES"", we test O, B, S? \n\n We already eliminated A, N? So perhaps both are equivalent? But Y is less common? So maybe ""ROBES"" is better? \n\n Another: ""HOUSE"": \n   H O U S E -> E at 5 -> avoid.\n\n How about ""HORDE"": \n   H O R D E -> R at 3? E at 5 -> avoid E at 5.\n\n Difficult.\n\n After rethinking, I think I\'ll go with ""ROBES"" because it covers O and S? and avoids the fifth position for E.\n\n So guess: ""ROBES""\n\n But let me confirm: \n   Positions: \n     position1: R -> we are testing if R is at 1? \n     position2: O -> new\n     position3: B -> new\n     position4: E -> we are testing if E is at 4? \n     position5: S -> new\n\n And we avoid R at 2? Yes? O and B could be new letters? \n\n However, an alternative word: ""SERUM"" -> \n   S E R U M -> \n     S at 1\n     E at 2 -> test E at 2?\n     R at 3 -> avoid R position 2? Yes? \n     U at 4? \n     M at 5?\n\n That is also a possibility? \n\n But we have E at 2? and R at 3? \n\n Comparing: \n   ""SERUM"": S, E, R, U, M\n   ""ROBES"": R, O, B, E, S\n\n We already know the word has R and E? so both use that? \n\n Then which letters do we want to cover? S is common? O is common? \n   SERUM uses U and M? ROBES uses O, B, S? \n\n S is more common than M? So ""SERUM"" might be better? \n\n But ""SERUM"" puts E at 2? In the first guess E was at 5? and now E at 2? \n\n Also, note: in the secret word, E might be at 2? then we get a check? \n\n However, we are free to test E at 2? \n\n Ultimately, I\'ll choose ""SERUM""? \n\n But let me see the letters: \n   By using ""SERUM"" we test: \n        S at 1 -> will it be check? \n        E at 2 -> \n        R at 3 -> note: we know R is not at 2? but R at 3 is new?\n        U at 4? \n        M at 5?\n\n Then we can get information on S, E, R, U, M? \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has the E in a position that we haven\'t guessed? For example, we had E at 5? Now we want to avoid E at 5? Also avoid E at 2? \n\n How about position 1? \n\n Consider ""ELVIS""? Not a word? \n ""EARNS"" -> A forbidden? \n ""EDGES"" -> duplicate E? \n ""EGRET"" -> duplicate E? \n\n How about ""ETHER""? \n   E T H E R -> duplicate E? \n\n How about ""ENROL""? -> uses N? forbidden.\n\n Then I think it\'s difficult to avoid E at 2? \n\n Actually, we know E is not at 5? And we don\'t have any information about other positions? So we can put E at any position except 5? \n\n We have also to consider: if we put E at 1, then we test a new position? \n\n Consider ""ENTRY"" -> N forbidden? \n\n How about ""EMPTY"": \n   E M P T Y -> positions: \n     E at 1? Okay? M at 2? P at 3? T at 4? Y at 5? \n   But then we avoid R? Wait, we know the secret word has R? So we must include R? \n\n Therefore, we cannot skip R? So the word must contain R? \n\n Therefore, the word ""EMPTY"" doesn\'t contain R -> invalid because we know the secret word has R? \n\n So the guess must include R and also E? \n\n Therefore, for our second guess we must have R and E? and avoid C, A, N? \n\n Conclusion: \n   We choose between ""ROBES"" and ""SERUM""? \n\n After careful consideration, I\'ll choose ""SERUM"" because we have R at a position that we haven\'t tried (position 3) and we cover S, U, M? \n\n Also, note that in ""SERUM"": \n   We avoid placing R at position 2 (it\'s at 3) and E at position 5? \n\n So let\'s go with ""SERUM"". \n\n I hope it\'s a valid word? Yes? \n\n Another common word: ""PRIME""? \n   P R I M E -> but R at position 2 -> avoid? So we must avoid R at position 2? So ""PRIME"" has R at 2 -> invalid.\n\n Final decision: ""SERUM""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (symbol: x).\n- R is in the word but **not** in position 2 (symbol: -).\n- E is in the word but **not** in position 5 (symbol: -).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include R and E (as they are in the secret word).\n- Must **avoid** C, A, and N.\n- R cannot be placed in position 2.\n- E cannot be placed in position 5.\n- Prioritize covering new common consonants (e.g., S, T, M) and avoiding duplicates for clarity.\n\nAfter considering words like ""ROBES"" and ""PERKY"", the word **""SERUM""** fits best:\n- Places R in position 3 (new position, avoids position 2).\n- Places E in position 2 (a position not yet tested).\n- Introduces new letters: S, U, M (no C, A, or N).\n- S at position 1, E at position 2, R at position 3, U at position 4, M at position 5—all distinct letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while maximizing coverage of common letters.\n\n<guess>serum</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: serum -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given:
 Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
 Guess 2: ""serum"" -> S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)

 Interpretation of feedback:

 From guess 1:
   - R is in the word, not at position 2.
   - E is in the word, not at position 5.
   - C, A, N are not in the word.

 From guess 2:
   - S(x): S is not in the word.
   - E(-): E is in the word but not at position 2 (because we guessed E at position 2 and got '-', meaning it's present but not here).
   - R(-): R is in the word but not at position 3 (because we guessed R at position 3 and got '-').
   - U(x): U is not in the word.
   - M(x): M is not in the word.

 Therefore, we now know:
   - The secret word contains R and E (from both guesses), but not at the positions we've tried so far.
   - We know the secret word does NOT contain: C, A, N, S, U, M (from the x's).

 Also, positions of R and E that have been tried and are incorrect:
   - R was tried at position 2 (from ""crane"") and position 3 (from ""serum"") -> both are incorrect. So R must be at position 1, 4, or 5? Because in a 5-letter word the positions are 1 to 5.
   - E at position 5 (from ""crane"") and position 2 (from ""serum"") -> both are incorrect. So E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

 Additionally, we have exclusions for letters: C, A, N, S, U, M.

 The word must have exactly 5 letters, including R and E, and three others that are not in the exclusions.

 We need to form a guess that:
   - Uses only letters not excluded: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and of course R and E).
   - Places R only at positions 1, 4, or 5? Because we tried 2 and 3? And similarly E at 1, 3, 4? (avoiding 2 and 5).

 Since the secret word must contain both R and E, and we have two letters known, we have three positions left? But the word can have other repeated letters? However, we haven't encountered duplicates yet? But the feedback doesn't forbid it? So the word might have duplicate letters? But let us proceed without assuming duplicates? We can try a word with distinct letters to avoid confusion? 

 However, in this case, we have only R and E known? But the secret word might have other letters? 

 We need to cover more common letters? 

 Specifically, we can try to include common consonants: T, L, etc.

 But note: we cannot place E at position 2 or 5? And R at position 2 or 3? So for our next guess, we must choose positions for R and E from the allowed ones? And introduce three new letters?

 How about:

   Place R at position 1? Then E at position 3 or 4? 

   Or R at position 4? Then E at position 1 or 3?

   Or R at position 5? Then E at position 1 or 3 or 4?

 Example word: if R at position 1, E at position 3? Then we can have: R ? E ? ?

 We have to fill the blanks? 

 Possibilities:

   Position 1: R
   Position 3: E

 Then we need letters for positions 2,4,5? 

 Position 2: must be a letter not excluded? And we don't know if it's E? But E cannot be at position 2? Because E(-) at position 2 in the second guess? So E is not at 2? Therefore, we use a different letter? 

 Similarly, let's form a word:

   R, [letter2], E, [letter4], [letter5]

 Example: ""RIPER""? 
   But duplicates? E might appear twice? We don't want duplicates? Also, ""I"", ""P"", ""E"", ""R"" -> but E at position 5? Avoid E at 5? Because from first guess we know E is not at 5? So ""RIPER"" has E at 5? -> invalid?

 How about ""RIVET""? 
   R:I:V:E:T -> positions: 
     1: R
     2: I
     3: V? wait: no, we want E at 3? 
   Actually, positions: 
     1: R -> allowed
     2: I -> must not be E? okay, because E not at 2? 
     3: E -> allowed? (since E can be at 3? because we tried E only at 2 and 5)
     4: E? ... wait: ""RIVET"" has letters: R, I, V, E, T -> which positions?
         R (1), I (2), V (3), E (4), T (5) -> then E is at position 4? which is allowed? 
   How about E at 4? That is allowed? 

   But wait: we want E at 4? That works? 

   So ""RIVET"": 
        R(1), I(2), V(3), E(4), T(5)

   This avoids:
        R at 2 and 3? Here R is at 1 -> not tried for R? (we tried position 2 and 3? but not 1) 
        E at 5? Avoided? We have E at 4 -> okay? 
        E at 2? Avoided.

   Also, introduces I, V, T? 

   But note: E is at 4? and R at 1? 

   Another: ""RILED"": 
        R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5) -> same pattern? E at 4.

   Another: ""RIDER"" -> duplicate R? 

   But note: the word must not have excluded letters? So ""RIVET"" is acceptable? 

   However, we have T at 5? That is okay? 

   But we don't know about E at 4? 

 Alternatively, if R is at position 4? Then we can have: 
   ... 
   For example: _ _ _ R _? 
   And we know E must be at 1? or 3? because E can be at 1,3,4? But if R is at 4? then E cannot be at 4? So E at 1 or 3? 

   Example: ""BOXER"" -> excludes: letter B? not excluded? but we haven't eliminated B? 
        B O X E R -> 
          B(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), R(5) -> 
          R at 5: we haven't tried? 
          E at 4: we haven't tried? 
        But note: in ""BOXER"", E is at 4? and R at 5? which are allowed? 
        And we avoid E at 5? 
        And avoid R at 2 and 3? 

        Also, positions: 
          4: E? -> but wait: we have E at 4? which is a new position? 
          5: R -> new.

        The word contains E and R? 
        And letters B, O, X? 

        However, X is uncommon? 

   Also, we have E at 4? which is the same as ""RIVET""? 

   But note: we need to choose a word that maximizes new letters? and common letters? 

   Let's compare: 
        ""RIVET"": letters R, I, V, E, T -> testing I, V, T? 
        ""BOXER"": letters B, O, X, E, R -> testing B, O, X? 

   We might prefer T because it is common? 

   Also, we can consider words that put E at positions 1 or 3? 

   For example: 
        E at 1? 
        Then we can have: E ? ? ? ? 
        Also, R must be at 4 or 5? 

        Example: ""ELDER"" -> 
           E(1), L(2), D(3), E(4)? -> wait, E at 1 and 4? duplicate? 
           Also, R at 5? So ""ELDER"" = E(1) L(2) D(3) E(4) [but actually it should be E(1), L(2), D(3), E(4), R(5)]? Wait, ""ELDER"" does not end with R? 

        ""ELDER"" is E L D E R? -> E at 1 and 4? R at 5? So we have E at 1? But also E at 4? 

        However, we know E is in the word? but we don't know if it is repeated? So we must avoid duplicates? Because if the word has only one E? then we might get confusing feedback? 

        So it's risky? 

   Therefore, to keep distinct letters? We can choose a word without duplicates? 

   So let us avoid duplicates? 

   Possibility: E at 1? 
      Then: E, [letter2], [letter3], [letter4], [letter5]? 
      Letter2: must be a consonant? and not excluded? 
      Letter3: R? Not possible because R is not allowed at position 3? We tried R at 3 and it was wrong? So R cannot be at 3? Therefore, R must be at 4 or 5? 

      Example: ""EATER"" -> duplicates? 
      ""ETHER"" -> duplicates?

   How about ""EERIE""? duplicates.

   Example without duplicate: ""EQUAL"" -> E Q U A L -> but U excluded? and A excluded? 

   ""ETHYL"": E T H Y L -> 
        positions: E(1), T(2), H(3), Y(4), L(5) -> does not have R! -> invalid? because must have R? 

   Therefore, any guess must include R? So we can't skip R? 

   Then for E at position 1? the word must have R at 4 or 5? 

   Example: ""ENTRY"" -> N excluded? 
   ""ERROR"" -> duplicate R? 

   So it's really hard? 

   Alternatively, E at position 3? 

      Pattern: ? ? E ? ? 
      But then R must be at 1,4, or 5? 

      Example: ""STEER"" -> S excluded? Avoid S? 
      ""CREEP"" -> C excluded? 
      ""GREET"" -> G? 
         G R E E T -> duplicate E? 
      ""TREND"" -> N excluded? 

   How about ""PROWL""? doesn't have E? 

   Therefore, E at 4? might be a good choice? 

   Similarly, R at 1? Since it's a common way to start? 

   So going back to: 
        R ? E ? ? -> but then position 3: E? 

        Example: ""RIVER"" -> duplicate R? 
        ""RIPEN"" -> N excluded? 
        ""RIPED"" -> what word? 

   Therefore, perhaps R at 1 and E at 4? 

        Pattern: R ? ? E ? 

        Example: ""ROGUE"": 
          R(1), O(2), G(3), U(4)? -> U excluded? 
        ""ROLEE"" -> duplicate E? 
        ""ROATE""? -> not valid?

        How about ""ROBED"": 
          R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? 
          Avoid exclusions? 
          O? Allowed? Because we haven't excluded O? 
          B? Allowed? 
          D? Allowed? 
          E? at position 4? which is allowed? 

          But note: we tried O? In the second guess? We had ""serum"" and none of the letters were O? So O not excluded? 

          Also, in ""ROBED"": 
             R at 1 -> not tried at 1 before? 
             O at 2 -> new?
             B at 3 -> new?
             E at 4 -> not tried before? 
             D at 5 -> new? 

          But note: we tried E at 2 and 5? Avoided? 
          We tried R at 2 and 3? Avoided? So R at 1? and E at 4? are both new? 

        So ""ROBED"" is a valid word? 

        But let me check: ""ROBED"" means past tense of rob? It's a verb? 

        Alternatively: ""RIDES"" -> 
          R I D E S -> positions: 
            R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), S(5) -> but S excluded? 

          So we must avoid S? 

        Then ""RIFLE"": 
          R(1), I(2), F(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5? Avoided? Because we know E not at 5? 

        ""RIFLE"" is invalid? 

        How about ""RIDGE"": 
          R I D G E -> 
            R(1), I(2), D(3), G(4), E(5) -> E at 5? invalid.

        ""RIPLE"" -> not common? 

        Therefore, ""ROBED"" seems a good option? 
        Alternatively, ""RIPED""? Not a word? 
        Another: ""ROTED""? Not common? 
        ""ROWED"": 
          R O W E D -> 
            R(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), D(5)

        Valid word? meaning ""propel"" a boat? 

        Also, avoids E at 5? 

        But note: we are testing O? which might be a vowel? 

   But wait: in our pattern, we have E at 4? 
   Also, note that we haven't guessed R at 1? So this guess will tell us if R is at position 1? 

   Similarly, we can test if there are T? 

   Given that we haven't tested T? which is common? 

   How about: 
        R at 1? then E at 4? 
        And we want to test T? 

        Example: ""RATED"": 
          R A T E D -> A excluded? 
        ""RITES"": 
          R I T E S -> S excluded? 
        ""RITES"" is invalid because S? 

        How about ""RITEW""? Not a word? 
        ""ROTE"" -> too short? 

        ""RUTED"" -> U excluded? 

        ""ROTEE"" -> duplicate E? 

        Actually, ""R"" at 1, then two letters? then E at 4? and last letter? 
        Example: ""ROTHE""? Not a word? 

        How about ""ROUTE"": 
          R O U T E -> U excluded? 

        Therefore, perhaps ""ROBED"" and ""ROWED"" are acceptable? But note: we haven't used T? 

   Alternatively, we can put R at position 4? And E at position 3? Then: ...? 

      Pattern: ? ? E? R ? ...? 

      Example: ""OFFER"" -> duplicate F? 
          O F E R ? ...? 
          But O at 1? F at 2? E at 3? R at 4? then fifth letter? e.g., ""OFFER"" has five: O F F E R? 
          But duplicate F? and F at 2 and 3? 

      How about ""PILER"" -> 
          P I L E R -> 
            P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), R(5) -> 
            Then R at 5? which is allowed? 
            And E at 4? 

        But wait: E at 4? And the pattern: 
            E: we tried at 2 and 5? Now at 4? 
            R: at 5? we tried R at 2 and 3? but not 5? 

        So ""PILER"" = P I L E R? 
        Valid? meaning one who piles? 

        And letters: P, I, L? We haven't excluded these? 

        Also, introducing L? common? 

   Then ""PILER"" vs ""ROBED"" vs ""ROWED""? 

   We also must consider: we introduced O and B in ""ROBED""? 

   But note: commonality? 

   I think ""ROBED"", ""ROWED"", and ""PILER"" are all acceptable? 

   However, let me think: 
        We know E is not at positions 2 and 5? So only 1,3,4? 
        We know R not at 2 and 3? So only 1,4,5? 

   Now, if in the word ""PILER"":
        E at 4? R at 5?
        So if R is at 5? and E at 4? 

        If the secret word has E at 4? and R at 5? then we would get checks? 

        Also, we can get minuses on P, I, L? 

   Similarly, in ""ROBED"":
        R at 1: if R is at 1? then check? 
        E at 4: if E is at 4? then check? 
        And then we know exactly two positions? 

   So ""ROBED"" has the advantage that we are testing R at a new position (1) and E at a new position (4)? 

   And if they are correct? we win? 

   But note: the secret word might be ""ROBED"" itself? 

   And in ""ROWED"", similarly? R at 1? O at 2? W at 3? E at 4? D at 5? 

   So we can choose ""ROBED""? 

   But note: in the second guess we already used M? which is excluded? So M is out? But ""ROBED"" doesn't have M? 

   So final guess: ""ROBED""

   Reason: 
      - Includes R and E? 
      - Positions: R at 1 (new), E at 4 (new) -> both allowed? 
      - Introduces new letters: O, B, D? 
      - Avoids excluded letters? 
      - Distinct letters? 

   We might get lucky? 

   But there is another possibility: E at 1? 
      Example: ""E? ? R?""? 

      Specifically, E at 1? R at 5? 
        Pattern: E ? ? ? R 

      Example: ""EAGER"" -> A excluded? 
      ""ENTER"" -> N excluded? 
      ""ELDER"" -> L? E? D? E? R? -> duplicate E? 
      ""EMBER"" -> B? 
           E(1), M(2) -> but M excluded? 
      ""EXFER"" -> not a word? 

      Also, E at 1? R at 4? 
        E ? ? R ? 

        ""ELTAR""? Not a word? 
        ""EDGER"" -> G? and D? 
           E(1), D(2), G(3), E(4)? duplicate? 
        ""ERROR"" -> duplicate R? 

      So it's hard? 

   Therefore, I go with ""ROBED"". 

   If not ""ROBED"", maybe ""TREND""? but N excluded? 

   Another: ""GRUEL"" -> G R U E L? U excluded? 

   Therefore, ""ROBED"" seems a solid choice? 
</think>
Based on the feedback from both guesses:

1. **Feedback from ""crane"" (Guess 1):**  
   - R is in the word, but not at position 2.  
   - E is in the word, but not at position 5.  
   - C, A, and N are absent.

2. **Feedback from ""serum"" (Guess 2):**  
   - E is not at position 2.  
   - R is not at position 3.  
   - S, U, and M are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed Letters:** R and E are in the word.  
- **Excluded Letters:** C, A, N, S, U, M.  
- **Constraints:**  
  - R cannot be at positions 2 or 3 (tried and failed).  
  - E cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (tried and failed).  
  - R must be at 1, 4, or 5.  
  - E must be at 1, 3, or 4.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize placing R and E in new, untested positions (e.g., R at 1 or 4; E at 3 or 4).  
- Introduce common letters not excluded (e.g., B, D, O, T) for maximum coverage.  
- Avoid duplicates for clarity.  

The word **""ROBED""** fits perfectly:
- R (position 1): Untested position; avoids 2 and 3.  
- E (position 4): Untested position; avoids 2 and 5.  
- O, B, D: New, common letters not excluded.  
- All letters distinct → clearer feedback.  

This guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while covering additional high-frequency consonants.

<guess>robed</guess>",robed,"We are given:
 Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
 Guess 2: ""serum"" -> S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)

 Interpretation of feedback:

 From guess 1:
   - R is in the word, not at position 2.
   - E is in the word, not at position 5.
   - C, A, N are not in the word.

 From guess 2:
   - S(x): S is not in the word.
   - E(-): E is in the word but not at position 2 (because we guessed E at position 2 and got '-', meaning it's present but not here).
   - R(-): R is in the word but not at position 3 (because we guessed R at position 3 and got '-').
   - U(x): U is not in the word.
   - M(x): M is not in the word.

 Therefore, we now know:
   - The secret word contains R and E (from both guesses), but not at the positions we've tried so far.
   - We know the secret word does NOT contain: C, A, N, S, U, M (from the x's).

 Also, positions of R and E that have been tried and are incorrect:
   - R was tried at position 2 (from ""crane"") and position 3 (from ""serum"") -> both are incorrect. So R must be at position 1, 4, or 5? Because in a 5-letter word the positions are 1 to 5.
   - E at position 5 (from ""crane"") and position 2 (from ""serum"") -> both are incorrect. So E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

 Additionally, we have exclusions for letters: C, A, N, S, U, M.

 The word must have exactly 5 letters, including R and E, and three others that are not in the exclusions.

 We need to form a guess that:
   - Uses only letters not excluded: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and of course R and E).
   - Places R only at positions 1, 4, or 5? Because we tried 2 and 3? And similarly E at 1, 3, 4? (avoiding 2 and 5).

 Since the secret word must contain both R and E, and we have two letters known, we have three positions left? But the word can have other repeated letters? However, we haven't encountered duplicates yet? But the feedback doesn't forbid it? So the word might have duplicate letters? But let us proceed without assuming duplicates? We can try a word with distinct letters to avoid confusion? 

 However, in this case, we have only R and E known? But the secret word might have other letters? 

 We need to cover more common letters? 

 Specifically, we can try to include common consonants: T, L, etc.

 But note: we cannot place E at position 2 or 5? And R at position 2 or 3? So for our next guess, we must choose positions for R and E from the allowed ones? And introduce three new letters?

 How about:

   Place R at position 1? Then E at position 3 or 4? 

   Or R at position 4? Then E at position 1 or 3?

   Or R at position 5? Then E at position 1 or 3 or 4?

 Example word: if R at position 1, E at position 3? Then we can have: R ? E ? ?

 We have to fill the blanks? 

 Possibilities:

   Position 1: R
   Position 3: E

 Then we need letters for positions 2,4,5? 

 Position 2: must be a letter not excluded? And we don't know if it's E? But E cannot be at position 2? Because E(-) at position 2 in the second guess? So E is not at 2? Therefore, we use a different letter? 

 Similarly, let's form a word:

   R, [letter2], E, [letter4], [letter5]

 Example: ""RIPER""? 
   But duplicates? E might appear twice? We don't want duplicates? Also, ""I"", ""P"", ""E"", ""R"" -> but E at position 5? Avoid E at 5? Because from first guess we know E is not at 5? So ""RIPER"" has E at 5? -> invalid?

 How about ""RIVET""? 
   R:I:V:E:T -> positions: 
     1: R
     2: I
     3: V? wait: no, we want E at 3? 
   Actually, positions: 
     1: R -> allowed
     2: I -> must not be E? okay, because E not at 2? 
     3: E -> allowed? (since E can be at 3? because we tried E only at 2 and 5)
     4: E? ... wait: ""RIVET"" has letters: R, I, V, E, T -> which positions?
         R (1), I (2), V (3), E (4), T (5) -> then E is at position 4? which is allowed? 
   How about E at 4? That is allowed? 

   But wait: we want E at 4? That works? 

   So ""RIVET"": 
        R(1), I(2), V(3), E(4), T(5)

   This avoids:
        R at 2 and 3? Here R is at 1 -> not tried for R? (we tried position 2 and 3? but not 1) 
        E at 5? Avoided? We have E at 4 -> okay? 
        E at 2? Avoided.

   Also, introduces I, V, T? 

   But note: E is at 4? and R at 1? 

   Another: ""RILED"": 
        R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5) -> same pattern? E at 4.

   Another: ""RIDER"" -> duplicate R? 

   But note: the word must not have excluded letters? So ""RIVET"" is acceptable? 

   However, we have T at 5? That is okay? 

   But we don't know about E at 4? 

 Alternatively, if R is at position 4? Then we can have: 
   ... 
   For example: _ _ _ R _? 
   And we know E must be at 1? or 3? because E can be at 1,3,4? But if R is at 4? then E cannot be at 4? So E at 1 or 3? 

   Example: ""BOXER"" -> excludes: letter B? not excluded? but we haven't eliminated B? 
        B O X E R -> 
          B(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), R(5) -> 
          R at 5: we haven't tried? 
          E at 4: we haven't tried? 
        But note: in ""BOXER"", E is at 4? and R at 5? which are allowed? 
        And we avoid E at 5? 
        And avoid R at 2 and 3? 

        Also, positions: 
          4: E? -> but wait: we have E at 4? which is a new position? 
          5: R -> new.

        The word contains E and R? 
        And letters B, O, X? 

        However, X is uncommon? 

   Also, we have E at 4? which is the same as ""RIVET""? 

   But note: we need to choose a word that maximizes new letters? and common letters? 

   Let's compare: 
        ""RIVET"": letters R, I, V, E, T -> testing I, V, T? 
        ""BOXER"": letters B, O, X, E, R -> testing B, O, X? 

   We might prefer T because it is common? 

   Also, we can consider words that put E at positions 1 or 3? 

   For example: 
        E at 1? 
        Then we can have: E ? ? ? ? 
        Also, R must be at 4 or 5? 

        Example: ""ELDER"" -> 
           E(1), L(2), D(3), E(4)? -> wait, E at 1 and 4? duplicate? 
           Also, R at 5? So ""ELDER"" = E(1) L(2) D(3) E(4) [but actually it should be E(1), L(2), D(3), E(4), R(5)]? Wait, ""ELDER"" does not end with R? 

        ""ELDER"" is E L D E R? -> E at 1 and 4? R at 5? So we have E at 1? But also E at 4? 

        However, we know E is in the word? but we don't know if it is repeated? So we must avoid duplicates? Because if the word has only one E? then we might get confusing feedback? 

        So it's risky? 

   Therefore, to keep distinct letters? We can choose a word without duplicates? 

   So let us avoid duplicates? 

   Possibility: E at 1? 
      Then: E, [letter2], [letter3], [letter4], [letter5]? 
      Letter2: must be a consonant? and not excluded? 
      Letter3: R? Not possible because R is not allowed at position 3? We tried R at 3 and it was wrong? So R cannot be at 3? Therefore, R must be at 4 or 5? 

      Example: ""EATER"" -> duplicates? 
      ""ETHER"" -> duplicates?

   How about ""EERIE""? duplicates.

   Example without duplicate: ""EQUAL"" -> E Q U A L -> but U excluded? and A excluded? 

   ""ETHYL"": E T H Y L -> 
        positions: E(1), T(2), H(3), Y(4), L(5) -> does not have R! -> invalid? because must have R? 

   Therefore, any guess must include R? So we can't skip R? 

   Then for E at position 1? the word must have R at 4 or 5? 

   Example: ""ENTRY"" -> N excluded? 
   ""ERROR"" -> duplicate R? 

   So it's really hard? 

   Alternatively, E at position 3? 

      Pattern: ? ? E ? ? 
      But then R must be at 1,4, or 5? 

      Example: ""STEER"" -> S excluded? Avoid S? 
      ""CREEP"" -> C excluded? 
      ""GREET"" -> G? 
         G R E E T -> duplicate E? 
      ""TREND"" -> N excluded? 

   How about ""PROWL""? doesn't have E? 

   Therefore, E at 4? might be a good choice? 

   Similarly, R at 1? Since it's a common way to start? 

   So going back to: 
        R ? E ? ? -> but then position 3: E? 

        Example: ""RIVER"" -> duplicate R? 
        ""RIPEN"" -> N excluded? 
        ""RIPED"" -> what word? 

   Therefore, perhaps R at 1 and E at 4? 

        Pattern: R ? ? E ? 

        Example: ""ROGUE"": 
          R(1), O(2), G(3), U(4)? -> U excluded? 
        ""ROLEE"" -> duplicate E? 
        ""ROATE""? -> not valid?

        How about ""ROBED"": 
          R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? 
          Avoid exclusions? 
          O? Allowed? Because we haven't excluded O? 
          B? Allowed? 
          D? Allowed? 
          E? at position 4? which is allowed? 

          But note: we tried O? In the second guess? We had ""serum"" and none of the letters were O? So O not excluded? 

          Also, in ""ROBED"": 
             R at 1 -> not tried at 1 before? 
             O at 2 -> new?
             B at 3 -> new?
             E at 4 -> not tried before? 
             D at 5 -> new? 

          But note: we tried E at 2 and 5? Avoided? 
          We tried R at 2 and 3? Avoided? So R at 1? and E at 4? are both new? 

        So ""ROBED"" is a valid word? 

        But let me check: ""ROBED"" means past tense of rob? It's a verb? 

        Alternatively: ""RIDES"" -> 
          R I D E S -> positions: 
            R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), S(5) -> but S excluded? 

          So we must avoid S? 

        Then ""RIFLE"": 
          R(1), I(2), F(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5? Avoided? Because we know E not at 5? 

        ""RIFLE"" is invalid? 

        How about ""RIDGE"": 
          R I D G E -> 
            R(1), I(2), D(3), G(4), E(5) -> E at 5? invalid.

        ""RIPLE"" -> not common? 

        Therefore, ""ROBED"" seems a good option? 
        Alternatively, ""RIPED""? Not a word? 
        Another: ""ROTED""? Not common? 
        ""ROWED"": 
          R O W E D -> 
            R(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), D(5)

        Valid word? meaning ""propel"" a boat? 

        Also, avoids E at 5? 

        But note: we are testing O? which might be a vowel? 

   But wait: in our pattern, we have E at 4? 
   Also, note that we haven't guessed R at 1? So this guess will tell us if R is at position 1? 

   Similarly, we can test if there are T? 

   Given that we haven't tested T? which is common? 

   How about: 
        R at 1? then E at 4? 
        And we want to test T? 

        Example: ""RATED"": 
          R A T E D -> A excluded? 
        ""RITES"": 
          R I T E S -> S excluded? 
        ""RITES"" is invalid because S? 

        How about ""RITEW""? Not a word? 
        ""ROTE"" -> too short? 

        ""RUTED"" -> U excluded? 

        ""ROTEE"" -> duplicate E? 

        Actually, ""R"" at 1, then two letters? then E at 4? and last letter? 
        Example: ""ROTHE""? Not a word? 

        How about ""ROUTE"": 
          R O U T E -> U excluded? 

        Therefore, perhaps ""ROBED"" and ""ROWED"" are acceptable? But note: we haven't used T? 

   Alternatively, we can put R at position 4? And E at position 3? Then: ...? 

      Pattern: ? ? E? R ? ...? 

      Example: ""OFFER"" -> duplicate F? 
          O F E R ? ...? 
          But O at 1? F at 2? E at 3? R at 4? then fifth letter? e.g., ""OFFER"" has five: O F F E R? 
          But duplicate F? and F at 2 and 3? 

      How about ""PILER"" -> 
          P I L E R -> 
            P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), R(5) -> 
            Then R at 5? which is allowed? 
            And E at 4? 

        But wait: E at 4? And the pattern: 
            E: we tried at 2 and 5? Now at 4? 
            R: at 5? we tried R at 2 and 3? but not 5? 

        So ""PILER"" = P I L E R? 
        Valid? meaning one who piles? 

        And letters: P, I, L? We haven't excluded these? 

        Also, introducing L? common? 

   Then ""PILER"" vs ""ROBED"" vs ""ROWED""? 

   We also must consider: we introduced O and B in ""ROBED""? 

   But note: commonality? 

   I think ""ROBED"", ""ROWED"", and ""PILER"" are all acceptable? 

   However, let me think: 
        We know E is not at positions 2 and 5? So only 1,3,4? 
        We know R not at 2 and 3? So only 1,4,5? 

   Now, if in the word ""PILER"":
        E at 4? R at 5?
        So if R is at 5? and E at 4? 

        If the secret word has E at 4? and R at 5? then we would get checks? 

        Also, we can get minuses on P, I, L? 

   Similarly, in ""ROBED"":
        R at 1: if R is at 1? then check? 
        E at 4: if E is at 4? then check? 
        And then we know exactly two positions? 

   So ""ROBED"" has the advantage that we are testing R at a new position (1) and E at a new position (4)? 

   And if they are correct? we win? 

   But note: the secret word might be ""ROBED"" itself? 

   And in ""ROWED"", similarly? R at 1? O at 2? W at 3? E at 4? D at 5? 

   So we can choose ""ROBED""? 

   But note: in the second guess we already used M? which is excluded? So M is out? But ""ROBED"" doesn't have M? 

   So final guess: ""ROBED""

   Reason: 
      - Includes R and E? 
      - Positions: R at 1 (new), E at 4 (new) -> both allowed? 
      - Introduces new letters: O, B, D? 
      - Avoids excluded letters? 
      - Distinct letters? 

   We might get lucky? 

   But there is another possibility: E at 1? 
      Example: ""E? ? R?""? 

      Specifically, E at 1? R at 5? 
        Pattern: E ? ? ? R 

      Example: ""EAGER"" -> A excluded? 
      ""ENTER"" -> N excluded? 
      ""ELDER"" -> L? E? D? E? R? -> duplicate E? 
      ""EMBER"" -> B? 
           E(1), M(2) -> but M excluded? 
      ""EXFER"" -> not a word? 

      Also, E at 1? R at 4? 
        E ? ? R ? 

        ""ELTAR""? Not a word? 
        ""EDGER"" -> G? and D? 
           E(1), D(2), G(3), E(4)? duplicate? 
        ""ERROR"" -> duplicate R? 

      So it's hard? 

   Therefore, I go with ""ROBED"". 

   If not ""ROBED"", maybe ""TREND""? but N excluded? 

   Another: ""GRUEL"" -> G R U E L? U excluded? 

   Therefore, ""ROBED"" seems a solid choice?Based on the feedback from both guesses:

1. **Feedback from ""crane"" (Guess 1):**  
   - R is in the word, but not at position 2.  
   - E is in the word, but not at position 5.  
   - C, A, and N are absent.

2. **Feedback from ""serum"" (Guess 2):**  
   - E is not at position 2.  
   - R is not at position 3.  
   - S, U, and M are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed Letters:** R and E are in the word.  
- **Excluded Letters:** C, A, N, S, U, M.  
- **Constraints:**  
  - R cannot be at positions 2 or 3 (tried and failed).  
  - E cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (tried and failed).  
  - R must be at 1, 4, or 5.  
  - E must be at 1, 3, or 4.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize placing R and E in new, untested positions (e.g., R at 1 or 4; E at 3 or 4).  
- Introduce common letters not excluded (e.g., B, D, O, T) for maximum coverage.  
- Avoid duplicates for clarity.  

The word **""ROBED""** fits perfectly:
- R (position 1): Untested position; avoids 2 and 3.  
- E (position 4): Untested position; avoids 2 and 5.  
- O, B, D: New, common letters not excluded.  
- All letters distinct → clearer feedback.  

This guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while covering additional high-frequency consonants.",Guess 3: robed -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,PLIER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word (x)
 - R is in the word but not in the correct position (-)
 - A is not in the word (x)
 - N is not in the word (x)
 - E is in the word but not in the correct position (-)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they appear in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

 Since we are making the second guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
 1. Includes R and E (because they are present in the secret word).
 2. Does not include C, A, or N.
 3. Places R in a position other than the second, and E in a position other than the fifth.

 Also, we should try to cover more common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that contain R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Possible vowels: We have E already, but we might need others (like I, O, U). Since A is out, we can try I or O.

 Common consonants besides R: S, T, L, etc.

 Example words: 
   ""ROUSE"": contains R, O, U, S, E -> but note the positions: R is first, E is fifth? 
     However, in our feedback, E is already known to not be fifth, so we cannot place E in the fifth position.

 Similarly, we must avoid placing R in the second position.

 Let's try to think of words with R and E, E not at the end, and R not at the second position.

 Alternatives:
   ""RESET"" -> But E is at positions 2 and 4? We don't know about multiple letters yet. Also, we might have duplicated letters?
   However, in the first guess the word had distinct letters, but the secret word might have duplicates.

 But note: in the feedback, we got two minuses for R and E, but we don't know if the secret word has multiple of these.

 Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. But we don't know.

 Since we are still early, it's better to try words without duplicates to get clearer information.

 However, let me check the rules: no mention if duplicates are allowed. Actually, Wordle does allow duplicated letters? 
 But typically, the secret word can have duplicate letters? Actually, the rules don't specify. But since the example didn't have duplicates, and in Wordle the secret word may have duplicates, but we must be cautious.

 Considering the feedback: if the same letter appears multiple times in the guess, then the feedback for that letter might be counted independently.

 However, to keep it simple for now, let's try to avoid duplicates.

 So, we need a word that:
   - Contains R and E (and three other letters not in {C, A, N})
   - R must not be in position 2 (but note: in our guess, position 2 is the second letter? Remember the indexing: guess was ""C R A N E"", so positions: 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E).
   - E must not be in position 5.

 And we want to maximize the possibility of covering new common letters.

 How about trying the letter O and T? 

 Consider ""ROUTE"": 
   R is at position 1 -> okay because in the first guess R was at position 2 and now we move it to 1? 
   But note: the feedback only said the secret word has R, so we can try any position except 2? Actually, we only avoid putting R at position 2? 
   What if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we would get a check.

   E is at position 5 -> but we know from feedback that E is not at position 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""ROUTE"" is not acceptable because E is at fifth.

 Another idea: ""STORE"" -> 
   positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)
   E at 5 -> invalid.

 We must avoid having E at fifth.

 How about ""STIRE""? That's not a word? 

 Let me think of words with E in the beginning or middle.

 Examples: 
   ""PERKY"": P E R K Y -> R at position 3 (was position 2 in first guess, so avoid that? Actually, we avoid position 2? But position 3 is new). 
   Also, E is at position 2.

 Conditions for positions:
   - R must not be in position 2 (according to feedback, because in the first guess it was at position 2 and we got '-', meaning correct letter but wrong position). 
     So we can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the secret word might have R at 2? Actually, no: because if the secret word had R at 2, then when we guessed R at 2, it would be a check (✓). 
     Since we got a minus, that means the secret word has an R at position 1,3,4, or 5? So let's avoid position 2.

   Similarly, E must not be at position 5? Actually, we got a minus for E at position 5? So in the secret word, E is at 1,2,3, or 4? So we avoid E at position 5.

 Also, we are avoiding the letters C, A, N.

 So, back to ""PERKY"": 
   P E R K Y -> positions: 
     1: P (new)
     2: E (now in second position -> we don't know if that's good? We can try)
     3: R (new position and not 2 -> good)
     4: K (new)
     5: Y (new)

 But is ""perky"" a valid word? Yes.

 However, let me consider if there's a better word.

 Another word: ""DRIVE"" -> 
   D R I V E
   R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we know R is not in position 2? So we must avoid putting R at 2.

 So ""DRIVE"" has R at 2 -> invalid for our purpose.

 Another: ""CRIER"" -> but C is not allowed? We avoid C.

 How about ""REMIT"": 
   R E M I T
   positions: R(1), E(2), M(3), I(4), T(5)
   E is at 2? Okay. R at 1? Okay. 
   But note: E is at position 2? We don't know if that's the right position? We might get a check or minus.

   Also, recall that we must avoid E at 5? Here E is at 2? So that's okay.

   But wait: what if E is in the secret word at a position other than 5? It might be at 2? We might get a check? Or if not, then minus.

   Let me see: the word ""REMIT"" seems valid? 

   But note: we have R at position 1? And we don't have any information about position 1? 

   However, we must avoid R at position 2? That's satisfied.

 Another: ""PRICE"" -> but P R I C E: C is not allowed? So invalid.

 Another: ""BRIDE"" -> B R I D E: R is at position 2? -> invalid because we must avoid R at 2.

 How about ""OWLER""? Not very common. 

 I think ""REMIT"" is a good candidate? But let's check common letters: R and E are already known, and we introduce M, I, T.

 Also, we can try ""TREND"": 
   T R E N D -> but N is forbidden? Because in first guess N was marked not present.

 Since we are avoiding N, we can't use ""TREND"".

 Another: ""PEDAL"" -> but A is forbidden? Because A was marked absent in the first guess.

 So, going back to ""PERKY"" and ""REMIT"", both are valid? 

 But note: ""PERKY"" has E at position 2, which we don't know about. Same for ""REMIT"" (R at 1, E at 2).

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts E at position other than 2 and 5? Like position 1, 3, or 4.

 Consider ""HELPS""? Not a 5-letter word? ""HELPS"" is only 5 letters? But H E L P S: E at 2? Still at 2? 

 How about ""EARTH"" -> avoid: E and A? A is forbidden.

 How about ""STERN"": 
   S T E R N -> forbidden N? So no.

 ""BIRSE"": meaning? It's a word? Let me avoid rare words.

 How about ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we avoid R in position 2.

 How about ""QUERY"": Q U E R Y -> E at 3? That's good. R at 4? Also good? Positions: 
   position1: Q -> uncommon? Maybe not the best.
   But we avoid R in 2? Yes, R is at 4? Good.
   E at 3: avoids position 5? Good.

 However, Q is uncommon and we might not cover common letters.

 Another: ""MERRY"" -> duplicate R? We try to avoid duplicates? Also, E at 2? 

 Let me think of ""GOURD"": doesn't have E? But we must include E.

 How about ""VERSE"": duplicate E? Also V E R S E -> E at position 2 and 5? But we cannot have E at 5? So if we have E in position 2 and 5, we avoid E at 5? Actually, the rule says: each letter independently? 
 But let's check: if we guess two E's, and the secret word has one E? Then one E might get a check (if in correct position) and the other might be absent? But the feedback rules: 

 ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols""

 And the example didn't cover duplicates? 

 However, to avoid complexity, I'll try a word without duplicates.

 So, consider ""ROGUE"": 
   R O G U E -> R at 1, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden? So invalid.

 Consider ""OILER"": 
   O I L E R -> E at 4? And R at 5? 
   Positions: 
      1: O
      2: I
      3: L
      4: E
      5: R -> but R is at the fifth? And we avoid R at 2? But fifth is okay? And E at 4? We avoid E at 5? Yes.

 So ""OILER"" is an option? But we don't know if that's common? And we skip some common letters? 

 Another: ""BRINE"": but N is forbidden? 

 We can also try ""HOMER"": 
   H O M E R -> E at 4? R at 5? 
   It includes E and R? And avoids forbidden letters? Yes.

 But note: O and M are new?

 However, let me compare: I want to test letters that are likely to be in the word? 

 We know: the word must have R and E? And avoid C, A, N. 

 Possible vowels: only E? or also others? Might be O, I, U? 

 Among the common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.

 Perhaps we can prioritize those?

 After reconsidering, I think ""STARE"" would have been a classic start? But we already started with ""CRANE"", so we have to adapt.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S T O L E -> E at 5 -> avoid E at 5? So invalid.

 ""STILE"": 
   S T I L E -> E at 5 -> avoid.

 Then ""STORE"" is invalid? 

 How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.

 Then ""SETTLE"" is 6 letters? 

 How about ""SPIRE"": 
   S P I R E -> positions: 
     1: S
     2: P
     3: I
     4: R -> R at position 4? (avoided position 2? yes)
     5: E -> avoid? because E cannot be at 5? So invalid.

 Then ""SPREE"": duplicate E? Also E at 5? 

 Let me try ""SPRUE"": not common.

 Given this, I am considering ""REMIT"" again? 

 Or ""PERCH"": but C is forbidden? 

 After some thought, I find ""RESTY"": 
   R E S T Y -> positions: 
     1: R -> R at position 1? (avoided position 2? yes)
     2: E -> E at 2? 
     3: S -> new
     4: T -> new
     5: Y -> new

 But note: E at 2? We don't know? And also, we are avoiding E at 5? But here E is at 2? So that's okay? But we need to avoid R at 2? Not violated.

 However, in the secret word E cannot be at 5? But we put E at 2? That's acceptable.

 But wait: what about the R? We are placing R at 1? We know from the previous feedback that R is in the word? But we don't know the position? So maybe if we put R at 1 we get a check? That would help.

 Similarly, if we get a minus for E at position 2, then we know E is not at 2? 

 Also, we cover S and T? which are common.

 So ""RESTY"" is a valid word? Yes? Meaning: given to rest? 

 But if not, how about ""RESET""? 
   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4? duplicate E? We avoid duplicates? 

 Let me avoid duplicates? And ""RESTY"" is a word.

 Alternative: ""TRUER"": duplicate R? 

 Or ""ROBES"": 
   R O B E S -> E at 4? So avoid E at 5? Okay? But R at 1, E at 4? 
   But S is also common? However, duplicate S? No? ROBES: positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5) -> all distinct.

 But E at 4? Okay.

 Also, we introduce O, B, S.

 After comparing: 
   ""RESTY"" = R E S T Y, distinct letters? Yes.

   ""ROBES"" = R O B E S, distinct.

 Both are good? 

 Also, ""TOWER"": 
   T O W E R -> E at 4? But R at 5? And R is repeated? Actually: T, O, W, E, R -> distinct? Yes? 
   But E at 4, R at 5? 

 Now, we have to decide:

 We want to maximize information? 

 In ""RESTY"", we have R and E? And test S, T, Y? 

 In ""ROBES"", we test O, B, S? 

 We already eliminated A, N? So perhaps both are equivalent? But Y is less common? So maybe ""ROBES"" is better? 

 Another: ""HOUSE"": 
   H O U S E -> E at 5 -> avoid.

 How about ""HORDE"": 
   H O R D E -> R at 3? E at 5 -> avoid E at 5.

 Difficult.

 After rethinking, I think I'll go with ""ROBES"" because it covers O and S? and avoids the fifth position for E.

 So guess: ""ROBES""

 But let me confirm: 
   Positions: 
     position1: R -> we are testing if R is at 1? 
     position2: O -> new
     position3: B -> new
     position4: E -> we are testing if E is at 4? 
     position5: S -> new

 And we avoid R at 2? Yes? O and B could be new letters? 

 However, an alternative word: ""SERUM"" -> 
   S E R U M -> 
     S at 1
     E at 2 -> test E at 2?
     R at 3 -> avoid R position 2? Yes? 
     U at 4? 
     M at 5?

 That is also a possibility? 

 But we have E at 2? and R at 3? 

 Comparing: 
   ""SERUM"": S, E, R, U, M
   ""ROBES"": R, O, B, E, S

 We already know the word has R and E? so both use that? 

 Then which letters do we want to cover? S is common? O is common? 
   SERUM uses U and M? ROBES uses O, B, S? 

 S is more common than M? So ""SERUM"" might be better? 

 But ""SERUM"" puts E at 2? In the first guess E was at 5? and now E at 2? 

 Also, note: in the secret word, E might be at 2? then we get a check? 

 However, we are free to test E at 2? 

 Ultimately, I'll choose ""SERUM""? 

 But let me see the letters: 
   By using ""SERUM"" we test: 
        S at 1 -> will it be check? 
        E at 2 -> 
        R at 3 -> note: we know R is not at 2? but R at 3 is new?
        U at 4? 
        M at 5?

 Then we can get information on S, E, R, U, M? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has the E in a position that we haven't guessed? For example, we had E at 5? Now we want to avoid E at 5? Also avoid E at 2? 

 How about position 1? 

 Consider ""ELVIS""? Not a word? 
 ""EARNS"" -> A forbidden? 
 ""EDGES"" -> duplicate E? 
 ""EGRET"" -> duplicate E? 

 How about ""ETHER""? 
   E T H E R -> duplicate E? 

 How about ""ENROL""? -> uses N? forbidden.

 Then I think it's difficult to avoid E at 2? 

 Actually, we know E is not at 5? And we don't have any information about other positions? So we can put E at any position except 5? 

 We have also to consider: if we put E at 1, then we test a new position? 

 Consider ""ENTRY"" -> N forbidden? 

 How about ""EMPTY"": 
   E M P T Y -> positions: 
     E at 1? Okay? M at 2? P at 3? T at 4? Y at 5? 
   But then we avoid R? Wait, we know the secret word has R? So we must include R? 

 Therefore, we cannot skip R? So the word must contain R? 

 Therefore, the word ""EMPTY"" doesn't contain R -> invalid because we know the secret word has R? 

 So the guess must include R and also E? 

 Therefore, for our second guess we must have R and E? and avoid C, A, N? 

 Conclusion: 
   We choose between ""ROBES"" and ""SERUM""? 

 After careful consideration, I'll choose ""SERUM"" because we have R at a position that we haven't tried (position 3) and we cover S, U, M? 

 Also, note that in ""SERUM"": 
   We avoid placing R at position 2 (it's at 3) and E at position 5? 

 So let's go with ""SERUM"". 

 I hope it's a valid word? Yes? 

 Another common word: ""PRIME""? 
   P R I M E -> but R at position 2 -> avoid? So we must avoid R at position 2? So ""PRIME"" has R at 2 -> invalid.

 Final decision: ""SERUM""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (symbol: x).
- R is in the word but **not** in position 2 (symbol: -).
- E is in the word but **not** in position 5 (symbol: -).

For the second guess:
- Must include R and E (as they are in the secret word).
- Must **avoid** C, A, and N.
- R cannot be placed in position 2.
- E cannot be placed in position 5.
- Prioritize covering new common consonants (e.g., S, T, M) and avoiding duplicates for clarity.

After considering words like ""ROBES"" and ""PERKY"", the word **""SERUM""** fits best:
- Places R in position 3 (new position, avoids position 2).
- Places E in position 2 (a position not yet tested).
- Introduces new letters: S, U, M (no C, A, or N).
- S at position 1, E at position 2, R at position 3, U at position 4, M at position 5—all distinct letters.

This guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while maximizing coverage of common letters.

<guess>serum</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: serum -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given:
 Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
 Guess 2: ""serum"" -> S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)

 Interpretation of feedback:

 From guess 1:
   - R is in the word, not at position 2.
   - E is in the word, not at position 5.
   - C, A, N are not in the word.

 From guess 2:
   - S(x): S is not in the word.
   - E(-): E is in the word but not at position 2 (because we guessed E at position 2 and got '-', meaning it's present but not here).
   - R(-): R is in the word but not at position 3 (because we guessed R at position 3 and got '-').
   - U(x): U is not in the word.
   - M(x): M is not in the word.

 Therefore, we now know:
   - The secret word contains R and E (from both guesses), but not at the positions we've tried so far.
   - We know the secret word does NOT contain: C, A, N, S, U, M (from the x's).

 Also, positions of R and E that have been tried and are incorrect:
   - R was tried at position 2 (from ""crane"") and position 3 (from ""serum"") -> both are incorrect. So R must be at position 1, 4, or 5? Because in a 5-letter word the positions are 1 to 5.
   - E at position 5 (from ""crane"") and position 2 (from ""serum"") -> both are incorrect. So E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

 Additionally, we have exclusions for letters: C, A, N, S, U, M.

 The word must have exactly 5 letters, including R and E, and three others that are not in the exclusions.

 We need to form a guess that:
   - Uses only letters not excluded: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and of course R and E).
   - Places R only at positions 1, 4, or 5? Because we tried 2 and 3? And similarly E at 1, 3, 4? (avoiding 2 and 5).

 Since the secret word must contain both R and E, and we have two letters known, we have three positions left? But the word can have other repeated letters? However, we haven't encountered duplicates yet? But the feedback doesn't forbid it? So the word might have duplicate letters? But let us proceed without assuming duplicates? We can try a word with distinct letters to avoid confusion? 

 However, in this case, we have only R and E known? But the secret word might have other letters? 

 We need to cover more common letters? 

 Specifically, we can try to include common consonants: T, L, etc.

 But note: we cannot place E at position 2 or 5? And R at position 2 or 3? So for our next guess, we must choose positions for R and E from the allowed ones? And introduce three new letters?

 How about:

   Place R at position 1? Then E at position 3 or 4? 

   Or R at position 4? Then E at position 1 or 3?

   Or R at position 5? Then E at position 1 or 3 or 4?

 Example word: if R at position 1, E at position 3? Then we can have: R ? E ? ?

 We have to fill the blanks? 

 Possibilities:

   Position 1: R
   Position 3: E

 Then we need letters for positions 2,4,5? 

 Position 2: must be a letter not excluded? And we don't know if it's E? But E cannot be at position 2? Because E(-) at position 2 in the second guess? So E is not at 2? Therefore, we use a different letter? 

 Similarly, let's form a word:

   R, [letter2], E, [letter4], [letter5]

 Example: ""RIPER""? 
   But duplicates? E might appear twice? We don't want duplicates? Also, ""I"", ""P"", ""E"", ""R"" -> but E at position 5? Avoid E at 5? Because from first guess we know E is not at 5? So ""RIPER"" has E at 5? -> invalid?

 How about ""RIVET""? 
   R:I:V:E:T -> positions: 
     1: R
     2: I
     3: V? wait: no, we want E at 3? 
   Actually, positions: 
     1: R -> allowed
     2: I -> must not be E? okay, because E not at 2? 
     3: E -> allowed? (since E can be at 3? because we tried E only at 2 and 5)
     4: E? ... wait: ""RIVET"" has letters: R, I, V, E, T -> which positions?
         R (1), I (2), V (3), E (4), T (5) -> then E is at position 4? which is allowed? 
   How about E at 4? That is allowed? 

   But wait: we want E at 4? That works? 

   So ""RIVET"": 
        R(1), I(2), V(3), E(4), T(5)

   This avoids:
        R at 2 and 3? Here R is at 1 -> not tried for R? (we tried position 2 and 3? but not 1) 
        E at 5? Avoided? We have E at 4 -> okay? 
        E at 2? Avoided.

   Also, introduces I, V, T? 

   But note: E is at 4? and R at 1? 

   Another: ""RILED"": 
        R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5) -> same pattern? E at 4.

   Another: ""RIDER"" -> duplicate R? 

   But note: the word must not have excluded letters? So ""RIVET"" is acceptable? 

   However, we have T at 5? That is okay? 

   But we don't know about E at 4? 

 Alternatively, if R is at position 4? Then we can have: 
   ... 
   For example: _ _ _ R _? 
   And we know E must be at 1? or 3? because E can be at 1,3,4? But if R is at 4? then E cannot be at 4? So E at 1 or 3? 

   Example: ""BOXER"" -> excludes: letter B? not excluded? but we haven't eliminated B? 
        B O X E R -> 
          B(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), R(5) -> 
          R at 5: we haven't tried? 
          E at 4: we haven't tried? 
        But note: in ""BOXER"", E is at 4? and R at 5? which are allowed? 
        And we avoid E at 5? 
        And avoid R at 2 and 3? 

        Also, positions: 
          4: E? -> but wait: we have E at 4? which is a new position? 
          5: R -> new.

        The word contains E and R? 
        And letters B, O, X? 

        However, X is uncommon? 

   Also, we have E at 4? which is the same as ""RIVET""? 

   But note: we need to choose a word that maximizes new letters? and common letters? 

   Let's compare: 
        ""RIVET"": letters R, I, V, E, T -> testing I, V, T? 
        ""BOXER"": letters B, O, X, E, R -> testing B, O, X? 

   We might prefer T because it is common? 

   Also, we can consider words that put E at positions 1 or 3? 

   For example: 
        E at 1? 
        Then we can have: E ? ? ? ? 
        Also, R must be at 4 or 5? 

        Example: ""ELDER"" -> 
           E(1), L(2), D(3), E(4)? -> wait, E at 1 and 4? duplicate? 
           Also, R at 5? So ""ELDER"" = E(1) L(2) D(3) E(4) [but actually it should be E(1), L(2), D(3), E(4), R(5)]? Wait, ""ELDER"" does not end with R? 

        ""ELDER"" is E L D E R? -> E at 1 and 4? R at 5? So we have E at 1? But also E at 4? 

        However, we know E is in the word? but we don't know if it is repeated? So we must avoid duplicates? Because if the word has only one E? then we might get confusing feedback? 

        So it's risky? 

   Therefore, to keep distinct letters? We can choose a word without duplicates? 

   So let us avoid duplicates? 

   Possibility: E at 1? 
      Then: E, [letter2], [letter3], [letter4], [letter5]? 
      Letter2: must be a consonant? and not excluded? 
      Letter3: R? Not possible because R is not allowed at position 3? We tried R at 3 and it was wrong? So R cannot be at 3? Therefore, R must be at 4 or 5? 

      Example: ""EATER"" -> duplicates? 
      ""ETHER"" -> duplicates?

   How about ""EERIE""? duplicates.

   Example without duplicate: ""EQUAL"" -> E Q U A L -> but U excluded? and A excluded? 

   ""ETHYL"": E T H Y L -> 
        positions: E(1), T(2), H(3), Y(4), L(5) -> does not have R! -> invalid? because must have R? 

   Therefore, any guess must include R? So we can't skip R? 

   Then for E at position 1? the word must have R at 4 or 5? 

   Example: ""ENTRY"" -> N excluded? 
   ""ERROR"" -> duplicate R? 

   So it's really hard? 

   Alternatively, E at position 3? 

      Pattern: ? ? E ? ? 
      But then R must be at 1,4, or 5? 

      Example: ""STEER"" -> S excluded? Avoid S? 
      ""CREEP"" -> C excluded? 
      ""GREET"" -> G? 
         G R E E T -> duplicate E? 
      ""TREND"" -> N excluded? 

   How about ""PROWL""? doesn't have E? 

   Therefore, E at 4? might be a good choice? 

   Similarly, R at 1? Since it's a common way to start? 

   So going back to: 
        R ? E ? ? -> but then position 3: E? 

        Example: ""RIVER"" -> duplicate R? 
        ""RIPEN"" -> N excluded? 
        ""RIPED"" -> what word? 

   Therefore, perhaps R at 1 and E at 4? 

        Pattern: R ? ? E ? 

        Example: ""ROGUE"": 
          R(1), O(2), G(3), U(4)? -> U excluded? 
        ""ROLEE"" -> duplicate E? 
        ""ROATE""? -> not valid?

        How about ""ROBED"": 
          R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? 
          Avoid exclusions? 
          O? Allowed? Because we haven't excluded O? 
          B? Allowed? 
          D? Allowed? 
          E? at position 4? which is allowed? 

          But note: we tried O? In the second guess? We had ""serum"" and none of the letters were O? So O not excluded? 

          Also, in ""ROBED"": 
             R at 1 -> not tried at 1 before? 
             O at 2 -> new?
             B at 3 -> new?
             E at 4 -> not tried before? 
             D at 5 -> new? 

          But note: we tried E at 2 and 5? Avoided? 
          We tried R at 2 and 3? Avoided? So R at 1? and E at 4? are both new? 

        So ""ROBED"" is a valid word? 

        But let me check: ""ROBED"" means past tense of rob? It's a verb? 

        Alternatively: ""RIDES"" -> 
          R I D E S -> positions: 
            R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), S(5) -> but S excluded? 

          So we must avoid S? 

        Then ""RIFLE"": 
          R(1), I(2), F(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5? Avoided? Because we know E not at 5? 

        ""RIFLE"" is invalid? 

        How about ""RIDGE"": 
          R I D G E -> 
            R(1), I(2), D(3), G(4), E(5) -> E at 5? invalid.

        ""RIPLE"" -> not common? 

        Therefore, ""ROBED"" seems a good option? 
        Alternatively, ""RIPED""? Not a word? 
        Another: ""ROTED""? Not common? 
        ""ROWED"": 
          R O W E D -> 
            R(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), D(5)

        Valid word? meaning ""propel"" a boat? 

        Also, avoids E at 5? 

        But note: we are testing O? which might be a vowel? 

   But wait: in our pattern, we have E at 4? 
   Also, note that we haven't guessed R at 1? So this guess will tell us if R is at position 1? 

   Similarly, we can test if there are T? 

   Given that we haven't tested T? which is common? 

   How about: 
        R at 1? then E at 4? 
        And we want to test T? 

        Example: ""RATED"": 
          R A T E D -> A excluded? 
        ""RITES"": 
          R I T E S -> S excluded? 
        ""RITES"" is invalid because S? 

        How about ""RITEW""? Not a word? 
        ""ROTE"" -> too short? 

        ""RUTED"" -> U excluded? 

        ""ROTEE"" -> duplicate E? 

        Actually, ""R"" at 1, then two letters? then E at 4? and last letter? 
        Example: ""ROTHE""? Not a word? 

        How about ""ROUTE"": 
          R O U T E -> U excluded? 

        Therefore, perhaps ""ROBED"" and ""ROWED"" are acceptable? But note: we haven't used T? 

   Alternatively, we can put R at position 4? And E at position 3? Then: ...? 

      Pattern: ? ? E? R ? ...? 

      Example: ""OFFER"" -> duplicate F? 
          O F E R ? ...? 
          But O at 1? F at 2? E at 3? R at 4? then fifth letter? e.g., ""OFFER"" has five: O F F E R? 
          But duplicate F? and F at 2 and 3? 

      How about ""PILER"" -> 
          P I L E R -> 
            P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), R(5) -> 
            Then R at 5? which is allowed? 
            And E at 4? 

        But wait: E at 4? And the pattern: 
            E: we tried at 2 and 5? Now at 4? 
            R: at 5? we tried R at 2 and 3? but not 5? 

        So ""PILER"" = P I L E R? 
        Valid? meaning one who piles? 

        And letters: P, I, L? We haven't excluded these? 

        Also, introducing L? common? 

   Then ""PILER"" vs ""ROBED"" vs ""ROWED""? 

   We also must consider: we introduced O and B in ""ROBED""? 

   But note: commonality? 

   I think ""ROBED"", ""ROWED"", and ""PILER"" are all acceptable? 

   However, let me think: 
        We know E is not at positions 2 and 5? So only 1,3,4? 
        We know R not at 2 and 3? So only 1,4,5? 

   Now, if in the word ""PILER"":
        E at 4? R at 5?
        So if R is at 5? and E at 4? 

        If the secret word has E at 4? and R at 5? then we would get checks? 

        Also, we can get minuses on P, I, L? 

   Similarly, in ""ROBED"":
        R at 1: if R is at 1? then check? 
        E at 4: if E is at 4? then check? 
        And then we know exactly two positions? 

   So ""ROBED"" has the advantage that we are testing R at a new position (1) and E at a new position (4)? 

   And if they are correct? we win? 

   But note: the secret word might be ""ROBED"" itself? 

   And in ""ROWED"", similarly? R at 1? O at 2? W at 3? E at 4? D at 5? 

   So we can choose ""ROBED""? 

   But note: in the second guess we already used M? which is excluded? So M is out? But ""ROBED"" doesn't have M? 

   So final guess: ""ROBED""

   Reason: 
      - Includes R and E? 
      - Positions: R at 1 (new), E at 4 (new) -> both allowed? 
      - Introduces new letters: O, B, D? 
      - Avoids excluded letters? 
      - Distinct letters? 

   We might get lucky? 

   But there is another possibility: E at 1? 
      Example: ""E? ? R?""? 

      Specifically, E at 1? R at 5? 
        Pattern: E ? ? ? R 

      Example: ""EAGER"" -> A excluded? 
      ""ENTER"" -> N excluded? 
      ""ELDER"" -> L? E? D? E? R? -> duplicate E? 
      ""EMBER"" -> B? 
           E(1), M(2) -> but M excluded? 
      ""EXFER"" -> not a word? 

      Also, E at 1? R at 4? 
        E ? ? R ? 

        ""ELTAR""? Not a word? 
        ""EDGER"" -> G? and D? 
           E(1), D(2), G(3), E(4)? duplicate? 
        ""ERROR"" -> duplicate R? 

      So it's hard? 

   Therefore, I go with ""ROBED"". 

   If not ""ROBED"", maybe ""TREND""? but N excluded? 

   Another: ""GRUEL"" -> G R U E L? U excluded? 

   Therefore, ""ROBED"" seems a solid choice?Based on the feedback from both guesses:

1. **Feedback from ""crane"" (Guess 1):**  
   - R is in the word, but not at position 2.  
   - E is in the word, but not at position 5.  
   - C, A, and N are absent.

2. **Feedback from ""serum"" (Guess 2):**  
   - E is not at position 2.  
   - R is not at position 3.  
   - S, U, and M are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed Letters:** R and E are in the word.  
- **Excluded Letters:** C, A, N, S, U, M.  
- **Constraints:**  
  - R cannot be at positions 2 or 3 (tried and failed).  
  - E cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (tried and failed).  
  - R must be at 1, 4, or 5.  
  - E must be at 1, 3, or 4.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize placing R and E in new, untested positions (e.g., R at 1 or 4; E at 3 or 4).  
- Introduce common letters not excluded (e.g., B, D, O, T) for maximum coverage.  
- Avoid duplicates for clarity.  

The word **""ROBED""** fits perfectly:
- R (position 1): Untested position; avoids 2 and 3.  
- E (position 4): Untested position; avoids 2 and 5.  
- O, B, D: New, common letters not excluded.  
- All letters distinct → clearer feedback.  

This guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while covering additional high-frequency consonants.

Includes R and E (because they are present in the secret word).\n 2. Does not include C, A, or N.\n 3. Places R in a position other than the second, and E in a position other than the fifth.\n\n Also, we should try to cover more common letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of words that contain R and E, and avoid C, A, N.\n\n Possible vowels: We have E already, but we might need others (like I, O, U). Since A is out, we can try I or O.\n\n Common consonants besides R: S, T, L, etc.\n\n Example words: \n   ""ROUSE"": contains R, O, U, S, E -> but note the positions: R is first, E is fifth? \n     However, in our feedback, E is already known to not be fifth, so we cannot place E in the fifth position.\n\n Similarly, we must avoid placing R in the second position.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words with R and E, E not at the end, and R not at the second position.\n\n Alternatives:\n   ""RESET"" -> But E is at positions 2 and 4? We don\'t know about multiple letters yet. Also, we might have duplicated letters?\n   However, in the first guess the word had distinct letters, but the secret word might have duplicates.\n\n But note: in the feedback, we got two minuses for R and E, but we don\'t know if the secret word has multiple of these.\n\n Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. But we don\'t know.\n\n Since we are still early, it\'s better to try words without duplicates to get clearer information.\n\n However, let me check the rules: no mention if duplicates are allowed. Actually, Wordle does allow duplicated letters? \n But typically, the secret word can have duplicate letters? Actually, the rules don\'t specify. But since the example didn\'t have duplicates, and in Wordle the secret word may have duplicates, but we must be cautious.\n\n Considering the feedback: if the same letter appears multiple times in the guess, then the feedback for that letter might be counted independently.\n\n However, to keep it simple for now, let\'s try to avoid duplicates.\n\n So, we need a word that:\n   - Contains R and E (and three other letters not in {C, A, N})\n   - R must not be in position 2 (but note: in our guess, position 2 is the second letter? Remember the indexing: guess was ""C R A N E"", so positions: 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E).\n   - E must not be in position 5.\n\n And we want to maximize the possibility of covering new common letters.\n\n How about trying the letter O and T? \n\n Consider ""ROUTE"": \n   R is at position 1 -> okay because in the first guess R was at position 2 and now we move it to 1? \n   But note: the feedback only said the secret word has R, so we can try any position except 2? Actually, we only avoid putting R at position 2? \n   What if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we would get a check.\n\n   E is at position 5 -> but we know from feedback that E is not at position 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at position 5.\n\n Therefore, ""ROUTE"" is not acceptable because E is at fifth.\n\n Another idea: ""STORE"" -> \n   positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)\n   E at 5 -> invalid.\n\n We must avoid having E at fifth.\n\n How about ""STIRE""? That\'s not a word? \n\n Let me think of words with E in the beginning or middle.\n\n Examples: \n   ""PERKY"": P E R K Y -> R at position 3 (was position 2 in first guess, so avoid that? Actually, we avoid position 2? But position 3 is new). \n   Also, E is at position 2.\n\n Conditions for positions:\n   - R must not be in position 2 (according to feedback, because in the first guess it was at position 2 and we got \'-\', meaning correct letter but wrong position). \n     So we can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the secret word might have R at 2? Actually, no: because if the secret word had R at 2, then when we guessed R at 2, it would be a check (✓). \n     Since we got a minus, that means the secret word has an R at position 1,3,4, or 5? So let\'s avoid position 2.\n\n   Similarly, E must not be at position 5? Actually, we got a minus for E at position 5? So in the secret word, E is at 1,2,3, or 4? So we avoid E at position 5.\n\n Also, we are avoiding the letters C, A, N.\n\n So, back to ""PERKY"": \n   P E R K Y -> positions: \n     1: P (new)\n     2: E (now in second position -> we don\'t know if that\'s good? We can try)\n     3: R (new position and not 2 -> good)\n     4: K (new)\n     5: Y (new)\n\n But is ""perky"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n However, let me consider if there\'s a better word.\n\n Another word: ""DRIVE"" -> \n   D R I V E\n   R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we know R is not in position 2? So we must avoid putting R at 2.\n\n So ""DRIVE"" has R at 2 -> invalid for our purpose.\n\n Another: ""CRIER"" -> but C is not allowed? We avoid C.\n\n How about ""REMIT"": \n   R E M I T\n   positions: R(1), E(2), M(3), I(4), T(5)\n   E is at 2? Okay. R at 1? Okay. \n   But note: E is at position 2? We don\'t know if that\'s the right position? We might get a check or minus.\n\n   Also, recall that we must avoid E at 5? Here E is at 2? So that\'s okay.\n\n   But wait: what if E is in the secret word at a position other than 5? It might be at 2? We might get a check? Or if not, then minus.\n\n   Let me see: the word ""REMIT"" seems valid? \n\n   But note: we have R at position 1? And we don\'t have any information about position 1? \n\n   However, we must avoid R at position 2? That\'s satisfied.\n\n Another: ""PRICE"" -> but P R I C E: C is not allowed? So invalid.\n\n Another: ""BRIDE"" -> B R I D E: R is at position 2? -> invalid because we must avoid R at 2.\n\n How about ""OWLER""? Not very common. \n\n I think ""REMIT"" is a good candidate? But let\'s check common letters: R and E are already known, and we introduce M, I, T.\n\n Also, we can try ""TREND"": \n   T R E N D -> but N is forbidden? Because in first guess N was marked not present.\n\n Since we are avoiding N, we can\'t use ""TREND"".\n\n Another: ""PEDAL"" -> but A is forbidden? Because A was marked absent in the first guess.\n\n So, going back to ""PERKY"" and ""REMIT"", both are valid? \n\n But note: ""PERKY"" has E at position 2, which we don\'t know about. Same for ""REMIT"" (R at 1, E at 2).\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that puts E at position other than 2 and 5? Like position 1, 3, or 4.\n\n Consider ""HELPS""? Not a 5-letter word? ""HELPS"" is only 5 letters? But H E L P S: E at 2? Still at 2? \n\n How about ""EARTH"" -> avoid: E and A? A is forbidden.\n\n How about ""STERN"": \n   S T E R N -> forbidden N? So no.\n\n ""BIRSE"": meaning? It\'s a word? Let me avoid rare words.\n\n How about ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we avoid R in position 2.\n\n How about ""QUERY"": Q U E R Y -> E at 3? That\'s good. R at 4? Also good? Positions: \n   position1: Q -> uncommon? Maybe not the best.\n   But we avoid R in 2? Yes, R is at 4? Good.\n   E at 3: avoids position 5? Good.\n\n However, Q is uncommon and we might not cover common letters.\n\n Another: ""MERRY"" -> duplicate R? We try to avoid duplicates? Also, E at 2? \n\n Let me think of ""GOURD"": doesn\'t have E? But we must include E.\n\n How about ""VERSE"": duplicate E? Also V E R S E -> E at position 2 and 5? But we cannot have E at 5? So if we have E in position 2 and 5, we avoid E at 5? Actually, the rule says: each letter independently? \n But let\'s check: if we guess two E\'s, and the secret word has one E? Then one E might get a check (if in correct position) and the other might be absent? But the feedback rules: \n\n ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols""\n\n And the example didn\'t cover duplicates? \n\n However, to avoid complexity, I\'ll try a word without duplicates.\n\n So, consider ""ROGUE"": \n   R O G U E -> R at 1, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden? So invalid.\n\n Consider ""OILER"": \n   O I L E R -> E at 4? And R at 5? \n   Positions: \n      1: O\n      2: I\n      3: L\n      4: E\n      5: R -> but R is at the fifth? And we avoid R at 2? But fifth is okay? And E at 4? We avoid E at 5? Yes.\n\n So ""OILER"" is an option? But we don\'t know if that\'s common? And we skip some common letters? \n\n Another: ""BRINE"": but N is forbidden? \n\n We can also try ""HOMER"": \n   H O M E R -> E at 4? R at 5? \n   It includes E and R? And avoids forbidden letters? Yes.\n\n But note: O and M are new?\n\n However, let me compare: I want to test letters that are likely to be in the word? \n\n We know: the word must have R and E? And avoid C, A, N. \n\n Possible vowels: only E? or also others? Might be O, I, U? \n\n Among the common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.\n\n Perhaps we can prioritize those?\n\n After reconsidering, I think ""STARE"" would have been a classic start? But we already started with ""CRANE"", so we have to adapt.\n\n How about ""STOLE"": \n   S T O L E -> E at 5 -> avoid E at 5? So invalid.\n\n ""STILE"": \n   S T I L E -> E at 5 -> avoid.\n\n Then ""STORE"" is invalid? \n\n How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.\n\n Then ""SETTLE"" is 6 letters? \n\n How about ""SPIRE"": \n   S P I R E -> positions: \n     1: S\n     2: P\n     3: I\n     4: R -> R at position 4? (avoided position 2? yes)\n     5: E -> avoid? because E cannot be at 5? So invalid.\n\n Then ""SPREE"": duplicate E? Also E at 5? \n\n Let me try ""SPRUE"": not common.\n\n Given this, I am considering ""REMIT"" again? \n\n Or ""PERCH"": but C is forbidden? \n\n After some thought, I find ""RESTY"": \n   R E S T Y -> positions: \n     1: R -> R at position 1? (avoided position 2? yes)\n     2: E -> E at 2? \n     3: S -> new\n     4: T -> new\n     5: Y -> new\n\n But note: E at 2? We don\'t know? And also, we are avoiding E at 5? But here E is at 2? So that\'s okay? But we need to avoid R at 2? Not violated.\n\n However, in the secret word E cannot be at 5? But we put E at 2? That\'s acceptable.\n\n But wait: what about the R? We are placing R at 1? We know from the previous feedback that R is in the word? But we don\'t know the position? So maybe if we put R at 1 we get a check? That would help.\n\n Similarly, if we get a minus for E at position 2, then we know E is not at 2? \n\n Also, we cover S and T? which are common.\n\n So ""RESTY"" is a valid word? Yes? Meaning: given to rest? \n\n But if not, how about ""RESET""? \n   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4? duplicate E? We avoid duplicates? \n\n Let me avoid duplicates? And ""RESTY"" is a word.\n\n Alternative: ""TRUER"": duplicate R? \n\n Or ""ROBES"": \n   R O B E S -> E at 4? So avoid E at 5? Okay? But R at 1, E at 4? \n   But S is also common? However, duplicate S? No? ROBES: positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5) -> all distinct.\n\n But E at 4? Okay.\n\n Also, we introduce O, B, S.\n\n After comparing: \n   ""RESTY"" = R E S T Y, distinct letters? Yes.\n\n   ""ROBES"" = R O B E S, distinct.\n\n Both are good? \n\n Also, ""TOWER"": \n   T O W E R -> E at 4? But R at 5? And R is repeated? Actually: T, O, W, E, R -> distinct? Yes? \n   But E at 4, R at 5? \n\n Now, we have to decide:\n\n We want to maximize information? \n\n In ""RESTY"", we have R and E? And test S, T, Y? \n\n In ""ROBES"", we test O, B, S? \n\n We already eliminated A, N? So perhaps both are equivalent? But Y is less common? So maybe ""ROBES"" is better? \n\n Another: ""HOUSE"": \n   H O U S E -> E at 5 -> avoid.\n\n How about ""HORDE"": \n   H O R D E -> R at 3? E at 5 -> avoid E at 5.\n\n Difficult.\n\n After rethinking, I think I\'ll go with ""ROBES"" because it covers O and S? and avoids the fifth position for E.\n\n So guess: ""ROBES""\n\n But let me confirm: \n   Positions: \n     position1: R -> we are testing if R is at 1? \n     position2: O -> new\n     position3: B -> new\n     position4: E -> we are testing if E is at 4? \n     position5: S -> new\n\n And we avoid R at 2? Yes? O and B could be new letters? \n\n However, an alternative word: ""SERUM"" -> \n   S E R U M -> \n     S at 1\n     E at 2 -> test E at 2?\n     R at 3 -> avoid R position 2? Yes? \n     U at 4? \n     M at 5?\n\n That is also a possibility? \n\n But we have E at 2? and R at 3? \n\n Comparing: \n   ""SERUM"": S, E, R, U, M\n   ""ROBES"": R, O, B, E, S\n\n We already know the word has R and E? so both use that? \n\n Then which letters do we want to cover? S is common? O is common? \n   SERUM uses U and M? ROBES uses O, B, S? \n\n S is more common than M? So ""SERUM"" might be better? \n\n But ""SERUM"" puts E at 2? In the first guess E was at 5? and now E at 2? \n\n Also, note: in the secret word, E might be at 2? then we get a check? \n\n However, we are free to test E at 2? \n\n Ultimately, I\'ll choose ""SERUM""? \n\n But let me see the letters: \n   By using ""SERUM"" we test: \n        S at 1 -> will it be check? \n        E at 2 -> \n        R at 3 -> note: we know R is not at 2? but R at 3 is new?\n        U at 4? \n        M at 5?\n\n Then we can get information on S, E, R, U, M? \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has the E in a position that we haven\'t guessed? For example, we had E at 5? Now we want to avoid E at 5? Also avoid E at 2? \n\n How about position 1? \n\n Consider ""ELVIS""? Not a word? \n ""EARNS"" -> A forbidden? \n ""EDGES"" -> duplicate E? \n ""EGRET"" -> duplicate E? \n\n How about ""ETHER""? \n   E T H E R -> duplicate E? \n\n How about ""ENROL""? -> uses N? forbidden.\n\n Then I think it\'s difficult to avoid E at 2? \n\n Actually, we know E is not at 5? And we don\'t have any information about other positions? So we can put E at any position except 5? \n\n We have also to consider: if we put E at 1, then we test a new position? \n\n Consider ""ENTRY"" -> N forbidden? \n\n How about ""EMPTY"": \n   E M P T Y -> positions: \n     E at 1? Okay? M at 2? P at 3? T at 4? Y at 5? \n   But then we avoid R? Wait, we know the secret word has R? So we must include R? \n\n Therefore, we cannot skip R? So the word must contain R? \n\n Therefore, the word ""EMPTY"" doesn\'t contain R -> invalid because we know the secret word has R? \n\n So the guess must include R and also E? \n\n Therefore, for our second guess we must have R and E? and avoid C, A, N? \n\n Conclusion: \n   We choose between ""ROBES"" and ""SERUM""? \n\n After careful consideration, I\'ll choose ""SERUM"" because we have R at a position that we haven\'t tried (position 3) and we cover S, U, M? \n\n Also, note that in ""SERUM"": \n   We avoid placing R at position 2 (it\'s at 3) and E at position 5? \n\n So let\'s go with ""SERUM"". \n\n I hope it\'s a valid word? Yes? \n\n Another common word: ""PRIME""? \n   P R I M E -> but R at position 2 -> avoid? So we must avoid R at position 2? So ""PRIME"" has R at 2 -> invalid.\n\n Final decision: ""SERUM""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (symbol: x).\n- R is in the word but **not** in position 2 (symbol: -).\n- E is in the word but **not** in position 5 (symbol: -).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include R and E (as they are in the secret word).\n- Must **avoid** C, A, and N.\n- R cannot be placed in position 2.\n- E cannot be placed in position 5.\n- Prioritize covering new common consonants (e.g., S, T, M) and avoiding duplicates for clarity.\n\nAfter considering words like ""ROBES"" and ""PERKY"", the word **""SERUM""** fits best:\n- Places R in position 3 (new position, avoids position 2).\n- Places E in position 2 (a position not yet tested).\n- Introduces new letters: S, U, M (no C, A, or N).\n- S at position 1, E at position 2, R at position 3, U at position 4, M at position 5—all distinct letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while maximizing coverage of common letters.\n\n<guess>serum</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: serum -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given:\n Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n Guess 2: ""serum"" -> S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)\n\n Interpretation of feedback:\n\n From guess 1:\n   - R is in the word, not at position 2.\n   - E is in the word, not at position 5.\n   - C, A, N are not in the word.\n\n From guess 2:\n   - S(x): S is not in the word.\n   - E(-): E is in the word but not at position 2 (because we guessed E at position 2 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not here).\n   - R(-): R is in the word but not at position 3 (because we guessed R at position 3 and got \'-\').\n   - U(x): U is not in the word.\n   - M(x): M is not in the word.\n\n Therefore, we now know:\n   - The secret word contains R and E (from both guesses), but not at the positions we\'ve tried so far.\n   - We know the secret word does NOT contain: C, A, N, S, U, M (from the x\'s).\n\n Also, positions of R and E that have been tried and are incorrect:\n   - R was tried at position 2 (from ""crane"") and position 3 (from ""serum"") -> both are incorrect. So R must be at position 1, 4, or 5? Because in a 5-letter word the positions are 1 to 5.\n   - E at position 5 (from ""crane"") and position 2 (from ""serum"") -> both are incorrect. So E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.\n\n Additionally, we have exclusions for letters: C, A, N, S, U, M.\n\n The word must have exactly 5 letters, including R and E, and three others that are not in the exclusions.\n\n We need to form a guess that:\n   - Uses only letters not excluded: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and of course R and E).\n   - Places R only at positions 1, 4, or 5? Because we tried 2 and 3? And similarly E at 1, 3, 4? (avoiding 2 and 5).\n\n Since the secret word must contain both R and E, and we have two letters known, we have three positions left? But the word can have other repeated letters? However, we haven\'t encountered duplicates yet? But the feedback doesn\'t forbid it? So the word might have duplicate letters? But let us proceed without assuming duplicates? We can try a word with distinct letters to avoid confusion? \n\n However, in this case, we have only R and E known? But the secret word might have other letters? \n\n We need to cover more common letters? \n\n Specifically, we can try to include common consonants: T, L, etc.\n\n But note: we cannot place E at position 2 or 5? And R at position 2 or 3? So for our next guess, we must choose positions for R and E from the allowed ones? And introduce three new letters?\n\n How about:\n\n   Place R at position 1? Then E at position 3 or 4? \n\n   Or R at position 4? Then E at position 1 or 3?\n\n   Or R at position 5? Then E at position 1 or 3 or 4?\n\n Example word: if R at position 1, E at position 3? Then we can have: R ? E ? ?\n\n We have to fill the blanks? \n\n Possibilities:\n\n   Position 1: R\n   Position 3: E\n\n Then we need letters for positions 2,4,5? \n\n Position 2: must be a letter not excluded? And we don\'t know if it\'s E? But E cannot be at position 2? Because E(-) at position 2 in the second guess? So E is not at 2? Therefore, we use a different letter? \n\n Similarly, let\'s form a word:\n\n   R, [letter2], E, [letter4], [letter5]\n\n Example: ""RIPER""? \n   But duplicates? E might appear twice? We don\'t want duplicates? Also, ""I"", ""P"", ""E"", ""R"" -> but E at position 5? Avoid E at 5? Because from first guess we know E is not at 5? So ""RIPER"" has E at 5? -> invalid?\n\n How about ""RIVET""? \n   R:I:V:E:T -> positions: \n     1: R\n     2: I\n     3: V? wait: no, we want E at 3? \n   Actually, positions: \n     1: R -> allowed\n     2: I -> must not be E? okay, because E not at 2? \n     3: E -> allowed? (since E can be at 3? because we tried E only at 2 and 5)\n     4: E? ... wait: ""RIVET"" has letters: R, I, V, E, T -> which positions?\n         R (1), I (2), V (3), E (4), T (5) -> then E is at position 4? which is allowed? \n   How about E at 4? That is allowed? \n\n   But wait: we want E at 4? That works? \n\n   So ""RIVET"": \n        R(1), I(2), V(3), E(4), T(5)\n\n   This avoids:\n        R at 2 and 3? Here R is at 1 -> not tried for R? (we tried position 2 and 3? but not 1) \n        E at 5? Avoided? We have E at 4 -> okay? \n        E at 2? Avoided.\n\n   Also, introduces I, V, T? \n\n   But note: E is at 4? and R at 1? \n\n   Another: ""RILED"": \n        R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5) -> same pattern? E at 4.\n\n   Another: ""RIDER"" -> duplicate R? \n\n   But note: the word must not have excluded letters? So ""RIVET"" is acceptable? \n\n   However, we have T at 5? That is okay? \n\n   But we don\'t know about E at 4? \n\n Alternatively, if R is at position 4? Then we can have: \n   ... \n   For example: _ _ _ R _? \n   And we know E must be at 1? or 3? because E can be at 1,3,4? But if R is at 4? then E cannot be at 4? So E at 1 or 3? \n\n   Example: ""BOXER"" -> excludes: letter B? not excluded? but we haven\'t eliminated B? \n        B O X E R -> \n          B(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), R(5) -> \n          R at 5: we haven\'t tried? \n          E at 4: we haven\'t tried? \n        But note: in ""BOXER"", E is at 4? and R at 5? which are allowed? \n        And we avoid E at 5? \n        And avoid R at 2 and 3? \n\n        Also, positions: \n          4: E? -> but wait: we have E at 4? which is a new position? \n          5: R -> new.\n\n        The word contains E and R? \n        And letters B, O, X? \n\n        However, X is uncommon? \n\n   Also, we have E at 4? which is the same as ""RIVET""? \n\n   But note: we need to choose a word that maximizes new letters? and common letters? \n\n   Let\'s compare: \n        ""RIVET"": letters R, I, V, E, T -> testing I, V, T? \n        ""BOXER"": letters B, O, X, E, R -> testing B, O, X? \n\n   We might prefer T because it is common? \n\n   Also, we can consider words that put E at positions 1 or 3? \n\n   For example: \n        E at 1? \n        Then we can have: E ? ? ? ? \n        Also, R must be at 4 or 5? \n\n        Example: ""ELDER"" -> \n           E(1), L(2), D(3), E(4)? -> wait, E at 1 and 4? duplicate? \n           Also, R at 5? So ""ELDER"" = E(1) L(2) D(3) E(4) [but actually it should be E(1), L(2), D(3), E(4), R(5)]? Wait, ""ELDER"" does not end with R? \n\n        ""ELDER"" is E L D E R? -> E at 1 and 4? R at 5? So we have E at 1? But also E at 4? \n\n        However, we know E is in the word? but we don\'t know if it is repeated? So we must avoid duplicates? Because if the word has only one E? then we might get confusing feedback? \n\n        So it\'s risky? \n\n   Therefore, to keep distinct letters? We can choose a word without duplicates? \n\n   So let us avoid duplicates? \n\n   Possibility: E at 1? \n      Then: E, [letter2], [letter3], [letter4], [letter5]? \n      Letter2: must be a consonant? and not excluded? \n      Letter3: R? Not possible because R is not allowed at position 3? We tried R at 3 and it was wrong? So R cannot be at 3? Therefore, R must be at 4 or 5? \n\n      Example: ""EATER"" -> duplicates? \n      ""ETHER"" -> duplicates?\n\n   How about ""EERIE""? duplicates.\n\n   Example without duplicate: ""EQUAL"" -> E Q U A L -> but U excluded? and A excluded? \n\n   ""ETHYL"": E T H Y L -> \n        positions: E(1), T(2), H(3), Y(4), L(5) -> does not have R! -> invalid? because must have R? \n\n   Therefore, any guess must include R? So we can\'t skip R? \n\n   Then for E at position 1? the word must have R at 4 or 5? \n\n   Example: ""ENTRY"" -> N excluded? \n   ""ERROR"" -> duplicate R? \n\n   So it\'s really hard? \n\n   Alternatively, E at position 3? \n\n      Pattern: ? ? E ? ? \n      But then R must be at 1,4, or 5? \n\n      Example: ""STEER"" -> S excluded? Avoid S? \n      ""CREEP"" -> C excluded? \n      ""GREET"" -> G? \n         G R E E T -> duplicate E? \n      ""TREND"" -> N excluded? \n\n   How about ""PROWL""? doesn\'t have E? \n\n   Therefore, E at 4? might be a good choice? \n\n   Similarly, R at 1? Since it\'s a common way to start? \n\n   So going back to: \n        R ? E ? ? -> but then position 3: E? \n\n        Example: ""RIVER"" -> duplicate R? \n        ""RIPEN"" -> N excluded? \n        ""RIPED"" -> what word? \n\n   Therefore, perhaps R at 1 and E at 4? \n\n        Pattern: R ? ? E ? \n\n        Example: ""ROGUE"": \n          R(1), O(2), G(3), U(4)? -> U excluded? \n        ""ROLEE"" -> duplicate E? \n        ""ROATE""? -> not valid?\n\n        How about ""ROBED"": \n          R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? \n          Avoid exclusions? \n          O? Allowed? Because we haven\'t excluded O? \n          B? Allowed? \n          D? Allowed? \n          E? at position 4? which is allowed? \n\n          But note: we tried O? In the second guess? We had ""serum"" and none of the letters were O? So O not excluded? \n\n          Also, in ""ROBED"": \n             R at 1 -> not tried at 1 before? \n             O at 2 -> new?\n             B at 3 -> new?\n             E at 4 -> not tried before? \n             D at 5 -> new? \n\n          But note: we tried E at 2 and 5? Avoided? \n          We tried R at 2 and 3? Avoided? So R at 1? and E at 4? are both new? \n\n        So ""ROBED"" is a valid word? \n\n        But let me check: ""ROBED"" means past tense of rob? It\'s a verb? \n\n        Alternatively: ""RIDES"" -> \n          R I D E S -> positions: \n            R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), S(5) -> but S excluded? \n\n          So we must avoid S? \n\n        Then ""RIFLE"": \n          R(1), I(2), F(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5? Avoided? Because we know E not at 5? \n\n        ""RIFLE"" is invalid? \n\n        How about ""RIDGE"": \n          R I D G E -> \n            R(1), I(2), D(3), G(4), E(5) -> E at 5? invalid.\n\n        ""RIPLE"" -> not common? \n\n        Therefore, ""ROBED"" seems a good option? \n        Alternatively, ""RIPED""? Not a word? \n        Another: ""ROTED""? Not common? \n        ""ROWED"": \n          R O W E D -> \n            R(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), D(5)\n\n        Valid word? meaning ""propel"" a boat? \n\n        Also, avoids E at 5? \n\n        But note: we are testing O? which might be a vowel? \n\n   But wait: in our pattern, we have E at 4? \n   Also, note that we haven\'t guessed R at 1? So this guess will tell us if R is at position 1? \n\n   Similarly, we can test if there are T? \n\n   Given that we haven\'t tested T? which is common? \n\n   How about: \n        R at 1? then E at 4? \n        And we want to test T? \n\n        Example: ""RATED"": \n          R A T E D -> A excluded? \n        ""RITES"": \n          R I T E S -> S excluded? \n        ""RITES"" is invalid because S? \n\n        How about ""RITEW""?

Not a word? \n\n        How about ""ROUTE"": \n          R O U T E -> U excluded? \n\n        Therefore, perhaps ""ROBED"" and ""ROWED"" are acceptable? But note: we haven\'t used T? \n\n   Alternatively, we can put R at position 4? And E at position 3? Then: ...? \n\n      Pattern: ? ? E? R ? ...? \n\n      Example: ""OFFER"" -> duplicate F? \n          O F E R ? ...? \n          But O at 1? F at 2? E at 3? R at 4? then fifth letter? e.g., ""OFFER"" has five: O F F E R? \n          But duplicate F? and F at 2 and 3? \n\n      How about ""PILER"" -> \n          P I L E R -> \n            P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), R(5) -> \n            Then R at 5? which is allowed? \n            And E at 4? \n\n        But wait: E at 4? And the pattern: \n            E: we tried at 2 and 5? Now at 4? \n            R: at 5? we tried R at 2 and 3? but not 5? \n\n        So ""PILER"" = P I L E R? \n        Valid? meaning one who piles? \n\n        And letters: P, I, L? We haven\'t excluded these? \n\n        Also, introducing L? common? \n\n   Then ""PILER"" vs ""ROBED"" vs ""ROWED""? \n\n   We also must consider: we introduced O and B in ""ROBED""? \n\n   But note: commonality? \n\n   I think ""ROBED"", ""ROWED"", and ""PILER"" are all acceptable? \n\n   However, let me think: \n        We know E is not at positions 2 and 5? So only 1,3,4? \n        We know R not at 2 and 3? So only 1,4,5? \n\n   Now, if in the word ""PILER"":\n        E at 4? R at 5?\n        So if R is at 5? and E at 4? \n\n        If the secret word has E at 4? and R at 5? then we would get checks? \n\n        Also, we can get minuses on P, I, L? \n\n   Similarly, in ""ROBED"":\n        R at 1: if R is at 1? then check? \n        E at 4: if E is at 4? then check? \n        And then we know exactly two positions? \n\n   So ""ROBED"" has the advantage that we are testing R at a new position (1) and E at a new position (4)? \n\n   And if they are correct? we win? \n\n   But note: the secret word might be ""ROBED"" itself? \n\n   And in ""ROWED"", similarly? R at 1? O at 2? W at 3? E at 4? D at 5? \n\n   So we can choose ""ROBED""? \n\n   But note: in the second guess we already used M? which is excluded? So M is out? But ""ROBED"" doesn\'t have M? \n\n   So final guess: ""ROBED""\n\n   Reason: \n      - Includes R and E? \n      - Positions: R at 1 (new), E at 4 (new) -> both allowed? \n      - Introduces new letters: O, B, D? \n      - Avoids excluded letters? \n      - Distinct letters? \n\n   We might get lucky? \n\n   But there is another possibility: E at 1? \n      Example: ""E? ? R?""? \n\n      Specifically, E at 1? R at 5? \n        Pattern: E ? ? ? R \n\n      Example: ""EAGER"" -> A excluded? \n      ""ENTER"" -> N excluded? \n      ""ELDER"" -> L? E? D? E?

We are given the feedback for the third guess ""robed"":
  R(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) D(x)

Interpretation:
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got '-' for R at position 1).
- O is not in the word (x).
- B is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) (✓).
- D is not in the word (x).

So now we know:
- The secret word has E at position 4 (because we got a check for E at position 4).
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (and we already knew it's not at 2 or 3 from previous guesses). Therefore, R must be at position 5 (since positions 1,2,3 are tried and failed, and position 4 is taken by E? So the only position left is 5?).
  - Positions: 1: R (tried and got '-') -> not position 1.
  - From guess1: R at position 2 -> not position 2.
  - From guess2: R at position 3 -> not position 3.
  - Position 4 is now occupied by E (and we have a check, so it's fixed). So R cannot be at 4? 
  - Therefore, R must be at position 5.

- Also, we have new exclusions: O, B, D are not in the word. So now the excluded letters are: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D.

- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5? 
  But wait: we haven't tried R at position 5? So we are deducing that R must be at 5? 

  Let me confirm: 
    Positions 1 to 5:
      Position 1: we tried R -> not here and not the only occurrence? But we know R is in the word? and we haven't placed it? 
      We tried R at 1,2,3 -> all wrong. So the only position left is 5? Because position 4 is E? 

  Therefore, the secret word has R at position 5.

- So the secret word pattern: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] E R

- We know letter1, letter2, letter3 are not in the excluded set? And they are not E or R? 

- Excluded letters: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D.

- Available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we must use three of these for positions 1,2,3).

- We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Now, we need to make a guess that fits the pattern: _ _ _ E R

We want to cover common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Common letters that are still available: T, L, I, P, H, G, etc.

We can try a word that has T, L, or other common letters in the first three positions.

Example words ending with ""ER"": 
  - TIGER: T I G E R -> pattern: T at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
    But note: we have the pattern: [1] [2] [3] E R -> so ""TIGER"" fits: T(1), I(2), G(3), E(4), R(5)
    And the letters: T, I, G are not excluded? 
    So we can try ""TIGER"".

  - Other possibilities: 
      ""LIVER"": L I V E R -> but V is available? 
      ""RIVER"": but R is already at 5? and we cannot have R at 1? but we are not putting R at 1? Actually, ""RIVER"" has R at 1 and 5? But we know R is only at 5? and we have E at 4? So ""RIVER"" would be R at 1? which we know is not present? Because we tried R at 1 and got minus? meaning R is not at 1? So ""RIVER"" would have R at 1? which is not allowed? So invalid.

  - ""TIGER"" is a good candidate? 

  - Also, ""PAGER"": P A G E R -> but A is excluded? 
  - ""HOVER"": H O V E R -> O excluded? 
  - ""LOWER"": L O W E R -> O excluded? 
  - ""TAPER"": T A P E R -> A excluded? 
  - ""WIDER"": W I D E R -> D excluded? 
  - ""FILER"": F I L E R -> F, I, L are available? 
  - ""TILER"": T I L E R -> T, I, L available? 
  - ""FIXER"": F I X E R -> F, I, X available? 
  - ""MIXER"": M excluded? 

So among these, ""TIGER"", ""FILER"", ""TILER"", ""FIXER"" are candidates? 

But note: we want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters? 

We can also consider: 
  ""TIGER"" tests T, I, G? 
  ""FILER"" tests F, I, L? 
  ""TILER"" tests T, I, L? 

Since T and L are common? 

But we don't know which one is more likely? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tested? 

But note: we have limited guesses left? 

We have 3 guesses left? (since we are on the fourth guess? We started with 6? and we are about to make the fourth? Actually, we made three: 1. crane, 2. serum, 3. robed -> so next is fourth guess? and we have two more after? 

But we want to solve it quickly? 

Given that we know the pattern is _ _ _ E R, and we have E and R fixed? 

We can try ""TIGER"" and see? 

But note: if ""TIGER"" is the word, we win? 

But if not, we get feedback on T, I, G? 

Similarly, ""TILER"" would test T, I, L? 

I think ""TIGER"" is a common word? 

But let me see: we have excluded many letters? 

The secret word must be a 5-letter word ending with ""ER"", with the third letter not being one of the excluded? 

Possible words: 
  We can list: 
    FIXER? 
    TIGER? 
    TILER? 
    FILER? 
    WIPER? (W is available) 
    HIKER? (H, I, K available) 
    LIKER? 
    RACER? A excluded? 
    MAKER? M excluded? 
    BAKER? B excluded? 
    JOKER? O excluded? 
    POKER? O excluded? 
    RULER? U excluded? 
    SIZER? S excluded? 
    TOWER? O excluded? 
    LOWER? O excluded? 
    POWER? O excluded? 
    HOVER? O excluded? 
    COVER? C and O excluded? 
    MOWER? M and O excluded? 
    DICER? D excluded? 
    NICER? N excluded? 
    RICER? R at 1? but we know R is not at 1? 
    So ""RICER"" is invalid? 

  Therefore, the candidate words are from the available letters? 

  We have: 
    F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

  And the pattern: [1][2][3]ER

  So the first three letters must form a valid 3-letter stem? 

  Common stems: 
    TIG, FIL, TIL, FIX, WIP, HIK, LIK, WIS, etc.

  We can try ""TIGER"" as a guess? 

  But note: we have to avoid using excluded letters? 

  So let's go with ""TIGER"". 

  If it's not the word, we get feedback on T, I, G? 

  We can then use that to narrow down? 

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters? 

  But T, I, G are common? 

  So I'll guess ""TIGER"". 

  But wait: what if the word is ""TILER""? We don't know? 

  But we have to choose one? 

  We can also consider ""WIPER"": 
    W I P E R -> W, I, P? 

  But T is more common than W? 

  So ""TIGER"" is better? 

  Final decision: ""TIGER""

  If the feedback shows that T, I, G are correct? then we win? 

  If not, we get information? 

  But note: we are confident that E and R are fixed? 

  So the guess is ""TIGER"".

### Analysis of Feedback from Previous Guesses:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - R is in the word but not at position 2.  
   - E is in the word but not at position 5.  
   - C, A, N are absent.  

2. **Guess 2: ""serum""**  
   - E is in the word but not at position 2.  
   - R is in the word but not at position 3.  
   - S, U, M are absent.  

3. **Guess 3: ""robed""**  
   - E is **correct and in position 4** (✓).  
   - R is in the word but not at position 1.  
   - O, B, D are absent.  

### Key Deductions:
- **E is fixed at position 4** (confirmed by ✓ in ""robed"").  
- **R must be at position 5**:  
  - R cannot be at positions 1 (tried in ""robed""), 2 (tried in ""crane""), or 3 (tried in ""serum"").  
  - Position 4 is occupied by E, leaving position 5 as the only possibility.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D.  
- **Secret word pattern**: `[letter1][letter2][letter3] E R`  
  - Letters 1–3 must be from the remaining pool: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, L, G) in positions 1–3.  
- Prioritize common words ending in ""ER"" (e.g., ""TIGER"", ""FILER"", ""TILER"").  
- ""TIGER"" is optimal:  
  - Tests T (position 1), I (position 2), G (position 3) — all common letters.  
  - Fits the pattern `_ _ _ E R` and avoids excluded letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word (x)
 - R is in the word but not in the correct position (-)
 - A is not in the word (x)
 - N is not in the word (x)
 - E is in the word but not in the correct position (-)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they appear in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

 Since we are making the second guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
 1. Includes R and E (because they are present in the secret word).
 2. Does not include C, A, or N.
 3. Places R in a position other than the second, and E in a position other than the fifth.

 Also, we should try to cover more common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that contain R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Possible vowels: We have E already, but we might need others (like I, O, U). Since A is out, we can try I or O.

 Common consonants besides R: S, T, L, etc.

 Example words: 
   ""ROUSE"": contains R, O, U, S, E -> but note the positions: R is first, E is fifth? 
     However, in our feedback, E is already known to not be fifth, so we cannot place E in the fifth position.

 Similarly, we must avoid placing R in the second position.

 Let's try to think of words with R and E, E not at the end, and R not at the second position.

 Alternatives:
   ""RESET"" -> But E is at positions 2 and 4? We don't know about multiple letters yet. Also, we might have duplicated letters?
   However, in the first guess the word had distinct letters, but the secret word might have duplicates.

 But note: in the feedback, we got two minuses for R and E, but we don't know if the secret word has multiple of these.

 Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. But we don't know.

 Since we are still early, it's better to try words without duplicates to get clearer information.

 However, let me check the rules: no mention if duplicates are allowed. Actually, Wordle does allow duplicated letters? 
 But typically, the secret word can have duplicate letters? Actually, the rules don't specify. But since the example didn't have duplicates, and in Wordle the secret word may have duplicates, but we must be cautious.

 Considering the feedback: if the same letter appears multiple times in the guess, then the feedback for that letter might be counted independently.

 However, to keep it simple for now, let's try to avoid duplicates.

 So, we need a word that:
   - Contains R and E (and three other letters not in {C, A, N})
   - R must not be in position 2 (but note: in our guess, position 2 is the second letter? Remember the indexing: guess was ""C R A N E"", so positions: 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E).
   - E must not be in position 5.

 And we want to maximize the possibility of covering new common letters.

 How about trying the letter O and T? 

 Consider ""ROUTE"": 
   R is at position 1 -> okay because in the first guess R was at position 2 and now we move it to 1? 
   But note: the feedback only said the secret word has R, so we can try any position except 2? Actually, we only avoid putting R at position 2? 
   What if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we would get a check.

   E is at position 5 -> but we know from feedback that E is not at position 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""ROUTE"" is not acceptable because E is at fifth.

 Another idea: ""STORE"" -> 
   positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)
   E at 5 -> invalid.

 We must avoid having E at fifth.

 How about ""STIRE""? That's not a word? 

 Let me think of words with E in the beginning or middle.

 Examples: 
   ""PERKY"": P E R K Y -> R at position 3 (was position 2 in first guess, so avoid that? Actually, we avoid position 2? But position 3 is new). 
   Also, E is at position 2.

 Conditions for positions:
   - R must not be in position 2 (according to feedback, because in the first guess it was at position 2 and we got '-', meaning correct letter but wrong position). 
     So we can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the secret word might have R at 2? Actually, no: because if the secret word had R at 2, then when we guessed R at 2, it would be a check (✓). 
     Since we got a minus, that means the secret word has an R at position 1,3,4, or 5? So let's avoid position 2.

   Similarly, E must not be at position 5? Actually, we got a minus for E at position 5? So in the secret word, E is at 1,2,3, or 4? So we avoid E at position 5.

 Also, we are avoiding the letters C, A, N.

 So, back to ""PERKY"": 
   P E R K Y -> positions: 
     1: P (new)
     2: E (now in second position -> we don't know if that's good? We can try)
     3: R (new position and not 2 -> good)
     4: K (new)
     5: Y (new)

 But is ""perky"" a valid word? Yes.

 However, let me consider if there's a better word.

 Another word: ""DRIVE"" -> 
   D R I V E
   R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we know R is not in position 2? So we must avoid putting R at 2.

 So ""DRIVE"" has R at 2 -> invalid for our purpose.

 Another: ""CRIER"" -> but C is not allowed? We avoid C.

 How about ""REMIT"": 
   R E M I T
   positions: R(1), E(2), M(3), I(4), T(5)
   E is at 2? Okay. R at 1? Okay. 
   But note: E is at position 2? We don't know if that's the right position? We might get a check or minus.

   Also, recall that we must avoid E at 5? Here E is at 2? So that's okay.

   But wait: what if E is in the secret word at a position other than 5? It might be at 2? We might get a check? Or if not, then minus.

   Let me see: the word ""REMIT"" seems valid? 

   But note: we have R at position 1? And we don't have any information about position 1? 

   However, we must avoid R at position 2? That's satisfied.

 Another: ""PRICE"" -> but P R I C E: C is not allowed? So invalid.

 Another: ""BRIDE"" -> B R I D E: R is at position 2? -> invalid because we must avoid R at 2.

 How about ""OWLER""? Not very common. 

 I think ""REMIT"" is a good candidate? But let's check common letters: R and E are already known, and we introduce M, I, T.

 Also, we can try ""TREND"": 
   T R E N D -> but N is forbidden? Because in first guess N was marked not present.

 Since we are avoiding N, we can't use ""TREND"".

 Another: ""PEDAL"" -> but A is forbidden? Because A was marked absent in the first guess.

 So, going back to ""PERKY"" and ""REMIT"", both are valid? 

 But note: ""PERKY"" has E at position 2, which we don't know about. Same for ""REMIT"" (R at 1, E at 2).

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts E at position other than 2 and 5? Like position 1, 3, or 4.

 Consider ""HELPS""? Not a 5-letter word? ""HELPS"" is only 5 letters? But H E L P S: E at 2? Still at 2? 

 How about ""EARTH"" -> avoid: E and A? A is forbidden.

 How about ""STERN"": 
   S T E R N -> forbidden N? So no.

 ""BIRSE"": meaning? It's a word? Let me avoid rare words.

 How about ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we avoid R in position 2.

 How about ""QUERY"": Q U E R Y -> E at 3? That's good. R at 4? Also good? Positions: 
   position1: Q -> uncommon? Maybe not the best.
   But we avoid R in 2? Yes, R is at 4? Good.
   E at 3: avoids position 5? Good.

 However, Q is uncommon and we might not cover common letters.

 Another: ""MERRY"" -> duplicate R? We try to avoid duplicates? Also, E at 2? 

 Let me think of ""GOURD"": doesn't have E? But we must include E.

 How about ""VERSE"": duplicate E? Also V E R S E -> E at position 2 and 5? But we cannot have E at 5? So if we have E in position 2 and 5, we avoid E at 5? Actually, the rule says: each letter independently? 
 But let's check: if we guess two E's, and the secret word has one E? Then one E might get a check (if in correct position) and the other might be absent? But the feedback rules: 

 ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols""

 And the example didn't cover duplicates? 

 However, to avoid complexity, I'll try a word without duplicates.

 So, consider ""ROGUE"": 
   R O G U E -> R at 1, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden? So invalid.

 Consider ""OILER"": 
   O I L E R -> E at 4? And R at 5? 
   Positions: 
      1: O
      2: I
      3: L
      4: E
      5: R -> but R is at the fifth? And we avoid R at 2? But fifth is okay? And E at 4? We avoid E at 5? Yes.

 So ""OILER"" is an option? But we don't know if that's common? And we skip some common letters? 

 Another: ""BRINE"": but N is forbidden? 

 We can also try ""HOMER"": 
   H O M E R -> E at 4? R at 5? 
   It includes E and R? And avoids forbidden letters? Yes.

 But note: O and M are new?

 However, let me compare: I want to test letters that are likely to be in the word? 

 We know: the word must have R and E? And avoid C, A, N. 

 Possible vowels: only E? or also others? Might be O, I, U? 

 Among the common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.

 Perhaps we can prioritize those?

 After reconsidering, I think ""STARE"" would have been a classic start? But we already started with ""CRANE"", so we have to adapt.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S T O L E -> E at 5 -> avoid E at 5? So invalid.

 ""STILE"": 
   S T I L E -> E at 5 -> avoid.

 Then ""STORE"" is invalid? 

 How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.

 Then ""SETTLE"" is 6 letters? 

 How about ""SPIRE"": 
   S P I R E -> positions: 
     1: S
     2: P
     3: I
     4: R -> R at position 4? (avoided position 2? yes)
     5: E -> avoid? because E cannot be at 5? So invalid.

 Then ""SPREE"": duplicate E? Also E at 5? 

 Let me try ""SPRUE"": not common.

 Given this, I am considering ""REMIT"" again? 

 Or ""PERCH"": but C is forbidden? 

 After some thought, I find ""RESTY"": 
   R E S T Y -> positions: 
     1: R -> R at position 1? (avoided position 2? yes)
     2: E -> E at 2? 
     3: S -> new
     4: T -> new
     5: Y -> new

 But note: E at 2? We don't know? And also, we are avoiding E at 5? But here E is at 2? So that's okay? But we need to avoid R at 2? Not violated.

 However, in the secret word E cannot be at 5? But we put E at 2? That's acceptable.

 But wait: what about the R? We are placing R at 1? We know from the previous feedback that R is in the word? But we don't know the position? So maybe if we put R at 1 we get a check? That would help.

 Similarly, if we get a minus for E at position 2, then we know E is not at 2? 

 Also, we cover S and T? which are common.

 So ""RESTY"" is a valid word? Yes? Meaning: given to rest? 

 But if not, how about ""RESET""? 
   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4? duplicate E? We avoid duplicates? 

 Let me avoid duplicates? And ""RESTY"" is a word.

 Alternative: ""TRUER"": duplicate R? 

 Or ""ROBES"": 
   R O B E S -> E at 4? So avoid E at 5? Okay? But R at 1, E at 4? 
   But S is also common? However, duplicate S? No? ROBES: positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5) -> all distinct.

 But E at 4? Okay.

 Also, we introduce O, B, S.

 After comparing: 
   ""RESTY"" = R E S T Y, distinct letters? Yes.

   ""ROBES"" = R O B E S, distinct.

 Both are good? 

 Also, ""TOWER"": 
   T O W E R -> E at 4? But R at 5? And R is repeated? Actually: T, O, W, E, R -> distinct? Yes? 
   But E at 4, R at 5? 

 Now, we have to decide:

 We want to maximize information? 

 In ""RESTY"", we have R and E? And test S, T, Y? 

 In ""ROBES"", we test O, B, S? 

 We already eliminated A, N? So perhaps both are equivalent? But Y is less common? So maybe ""ROBES"" is better? 

 Another: ""HOUSE"": 
   H O U S E -> E at 5 -> avoid.

 How about ""HORDE"": 
   H O R D E -> R at 3? E at 5 -> avoid E at 5.

 Difficult.

 After rethinking, I think I'll go with ""ROBES"" because it covers O and S? and avoids the fifth position for E.

 So guess: ""ROBES""

 But let me confirm: 
   Positions: 
     position1: R -> we are testing if R is at 1? 
     position2: O -> new
     position3: B -> new
     position4: E -> we are testing if E is at 4? 
     position5: S -> new

 And we avoid R at 2? Yes? O and B could be new letters? 

 However, an alternative word: ""SERUM"" -> 
   S E R U M -> 
     S at 1
     E at 2 -> test E at 2?
     R at 3 -> avoid R position 2? Yes? 
     U at 4? 
     M at 5?

 That is also a possibility? 

 But we have E at 2? and R at 3? 

 Comparing: 
   ""SERUM"": S, E, R, U, M
   ""ROBES"": R, O, B, E, S

 We already know the word has R and E? so both use that? 

 Then which letters do we want to cover? S is common? O is common? 
   SERUM uses U and M? ROBES uses O, B, S? 

 S is more common than M? So ""SERUM"" might be better? 

 But ""SERUM"" puts E at 2? In the first guess E was at 5? and now E at 2? 

 Also, note: in the secret word, E might be at 2? then we get a check? 

 However, we are free to test E at 2? 

 Ultimately, I'll choose ""SERUM""? 

 But let me see the letters: 
   By using ""SERUM"" we test: 
        S at 1 -> will it be check? 
        E at 2 -> 
        R at 3 -> note: we know R is not at 2? but R at 3 is new?
        U at 4? 
        M at 5?

 Then we can get information on S, E, R, U, M? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has the E in a position that we haven't guessed? For example, we had E at 5? Now we want to avoid E at 5? Also avoid E at 2? 

 How about position 1? 

 Consider ""ELVIS""? Not a word? 
 ""EARNS"" -> A forbidden? 
 ""EDGES"" -> duplicate E? 
 ""EGRET"" -> duplicate E? 

 How about ""ETHER""? 
   E T H E R -> duplicate E? 

 How about ""ENROL""? -> uses N? forbidden.

 Then I think it's difficult to avoid E at 2? 

 Actually, we know E is not at 5? And we don't have any information about other positions? So we can put E at any position except 5? 

 We have also to consider: if we put E at 1, then we test a new position? 

 Consider ""ENTRY"" -> N forbidden? 

 How about ""EMPTY"": 
   E M P T Y -> positions: 
     E at 1? Okay? M at 2? P at 3? T at 4? Y at 5? 
   But then we avoid R? Wait, we know the secret word has R? So we must include R? 

 Therefore, we cannot skip R? So the word must contain R? 

 Therefore, the word ""EMPTY"" doesn't contain R -> invalid because we know the secret word has R? 

 So the guess must include R and also E? 

 Therefore, for our second guess we must have R and E? and avoid C, A, N? 

 Conclusion: 
   We choose between ""ROBES"" and ""SERUM""? 

 After careful consideration, I'll choose ""SERUM"" because we have R at a position that we haven't tried (position 3) and we cover S, U, M? 

 Also, note that in ""SERUM"": 
   We avoid placing R at position 2 (it's at 3) and E at position 5? 

 So let's go with ""SERUM"". 

 I hope it's a valid word? Yes? 

 Another common word: ""PRIME""? 
   P R I M E -> but R at position 2 -> avoid? So we must avoid R at position 2? So ""PRIME"" has R at 2 -> invalid.

 Final decision: ""SERUM""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (symbol: x).
- R is in the word but **not** in position 2 (symbol: -).
- E is in the word but **not** in position 5 (symbol: -).

For the second guess:
- Must include R and E (as they are in the secret word).
- Must **avoid** C, A, and N.
- R cannot be placed in position 2.
- E cannot be placed in position 5.
- Prioritize covering new common consonants (e.g., S, T, M) and avoiding duplicates for clarity.

After considering words like ""ROBES"" and ""PERKY"", the word **""SERUM""** fits best:
- Places R in position 3 (new position, avoids position 2).
- Places E in position 2 (a position not yet tested).
- Introduces new letters: S, U, M (no C, A, or N).
- S at position 1, E at position 2, R at position 3, U at position 4, M at position 5—all distinct letters.

This guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while maximizing coverage of common letters.

<guess>serum</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: serum -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given:
 Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
 Guess 2: ""serum"" -> S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)

 Interpretation of feedback:

 From guess 1:
   - R is in the word, not at position 2.
   - E is in the word, not at position 5.
   - C, A, N are not in the word.

 From guess 2:
   - S(x): S is not in the word.
   - E(-): E is in the word but not at position 2 (because we guessed E at position 2 and got '-', meaning it's present but not here).
   - R(-): R is in the word but not at position 3 (because we guessed R at position 3 and got '-').
   - U(x): U is not in the word.
   - M(x): M is not in the word.

 Therefore, we now know:
   - The secret word contains R and E (from both guesses), but not at the positions we've tried so far.
   - We know the secret word does NOT contain: C, A, N, S, U, M (from the x's).

 Also, positions of R and E that have been tried and are incorrect:
   - R was tried at position 2 (from ""crane"") and position 3 (from ""serum"") -> both are incorrect. So R must be at position 1, 4, or 5? Because in a 5-letter word the positions are 1 to 5.
   - E at position 5 (from ""crane"") and position 2 (from ""serum"") -> both are incorrect. So E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

 Additionally, we have exclusions for letters: C, A, N, S, U, M.

 The word must have exactly 5 letters, including R and E, and three others that are not in the exclusions.

 We need to form a guess that:
   - Uses only letters not excluded: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and of course R and E).
   - Places R only at positions 1, 4, or 5? Because we tried 2 and 3? And similarly E at 1, 3, 4? (avoiding 2 and 5).

 Since the secret word must contain both R and E, and we have two letters known, we have three positions left? But the word can have other repeated letters? However, we haven't encountered duplicates yet? But the feedback doesn't forbid it? So the word might have duplicate letters? But let us proceed without assuming duplicates? We can try a word with distinct letters to avoid confusion? 

 However, in this case, we have only R and E known? But the secret word might have other letters? 

 We need to cover more common letters? 

 Specifically, we can try to include common consonants: T, L, etc.

 But note: we cannot place E at position 2 or 5? And R at position 2 or 3? So for our next guess, we must choose positions for R and E from the allowed ones? And introduce three new letters?

 How about:

   Place R at position 1? Then E at position 3 or 4? 

   Or R at position 4? Then E at position 1 or 3?

   Or R at position 5? Then E at position 1 or 3 or 4?

 Example word: if R at position 1, E at position 3? Then we can have: R ? E ? ?

 We have to fill the blanks? 

 Possibilities:

   Position 1: R
   Position 3: E

 Then we need letters for positions 2,4,5? 

 Position 2: must be a letter not excluded? And we don't know if it's E? But E cannot be at position 2? Because E(-) at position 2 in the second guess? So E is not at 2? Therefore, we use a different letter? 

 Similarly, let's form a word:

   R, [letter2], E, [letter4], [letter5]

 Example: ""RIPER""? 
   But duplicates? E might appear twice? We don't want duplicates? Also, ""I"", ""P"", ""E"", ""R"" -> but E at position 5? Avoid E at 5? Because from first guess we know E is not at 5? So ""RIPER"" has E at 5? -> invalid?

 How about ""RIVET""? 
   R:I:V:E:T -> positions: 
     1: R
     2: I
     3: V? wait: no, we want E at 3? 
   Actually, positions: 
     1: R -> allowed
     2: I -> must not be E? okay, because E not at 2? 
     3: E -> allowed? (since E can be at 3? because we tried E only at 2 and 5)
     4: E? ... wait: ""RIVET"" has letters: R, I, V, E, T -> which positions?
         R (1), I (2), V (3), E (4), T (5) -> then E is at position 4? which is allowed? 
   How about E at 4? That is allowed? 

   But wait: we want E at 4? That works? 

   So ""RIVET"": 
        R(1), I(2), V(3), E(4), T(5)

   This avoids:
        R at 2 and 3? Here R is at 1 -> not tried for R? (we tried position 2 and 3? but not 1) 
        E at 5? Avoided? We have E at 4 -> okay? 
        E at 2? Avoided.

   Also, introduces I, V, T? 

   But note: E is at 4? and R at 1? 

   Another: ""RILED"": 
        R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5) -> same pattern? E at 4.

   Another: ""RIDER"" -> duplicate R? 

   But note: the word must not have excluded letters? So ""RIVET"" is acceptable? 

   However, we have T at 5? That is okay? 

   But we don't know about E at 4? 

 Alternatively, if R is at position 4? Then we can have: 
   ... 
   For example: _ _ _ R _? 
   And we know E must be at 1? or 3? because E can be at 1,3,4? But if R is at 4? then E cannot be at 4? So E at 1 or 3? 

   Example: ""BOXER"" -> excludes: letter B? not excluded? but we haven't eliminated B? 
        B O X E R -> 
          B(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), R(5) -> 
          R at 5: we haven't tried? 
          E at 4: we haven't tried? 
        But note: in ""BOXER"", E is at 4? and R at 5? which are allowed? 
        And we avoid E at 5? 
        And avoid R at 2 and 3? 

        Also, positions: 
          4: E? -> but wait: we have E at 4? which is a new position? 
          5: R -> new.

        The word contains E and R? 
        And letters B, O, X? 

        However, X is uncommon? 

   Also, we have E at 4? which is the same as ""RIVET""? 

   But note: we need to choose a word that maximizes new letters? and common letters? 

   Let's compare: 
        ""RIVET"": letters R, I, V, E, T -> testing I, V, T? 
        ""BOXER"": letters B, O, X, E, R -> testing B, O, X? 

   We might prefer T because it is common? 

   Also, we can consider words that put E at positions 1 or 3? 

   For example: 
        E at 1? 
        Then we can have: E ? ? ? ? 
        Also, R must be at 4 or 5? 

        Example: ""ELDER"" -> 
           E(1), L(2), D(3), E(4)? -> wait, E at 1 and 4? duplicate? 
           Also, R at 5? So ""ELDER"" = E(1) L(2) D(3) E(4) [but actually it should be E(1), L(2), D(3), E(4), R(5)]? Wait, ""ELDER"" does not end with R? 

        ""ELDER"" is E L D E R? -> E at 1 and 4? R at 5? So we have E at 1? But also E at 4? 

        However, we know E is in the word? but we don't know if it is repeated? So we must avoid duplicates? Because if the word has only one E? then we might get confusing feedback? 

        So it's risky? 

   Therefore, to keep distinct letters? We can choose a word without duplicates? 

   So let us avoid duplicates? 

   Possibility: E at 1? 
      Then: E, [letter2], [letter3], [letter4], [letter5]? 
      Letter2: must be a consonant? and not excluded? 
      Letter3: R? Not possible because R is not allowed at position 3? We tried R at 3 and it was wrong? So R cannot be at 3? Therefore, R must be at 4 or 5? 

      Example: ""EATER"" -> duplicates? 
      ""ETHER"" -> duplicates?

   How about ""EERIE""? duplicates.

   Example without duplicate: ""EQUAL"" -> E Q U A L -> but U excluded? and A excluded? 

   ""ETHYL"": E T H Y L -> 
        positions: E(1), T(2), H(3), Y(4), L(5) -> does not have R! -> invalid? because must have R? 

   Therefore, any guess must include R? So we can't skip R? 

   Then for E at position 1? the word must have R at 4 or 5? 

   Example: ""ENTRY"" -> N excluded? 
   ""ERROR"" -> duplicate R? 

   So it's really hard? 

   Alternatively, E at position 3? 

      Pattern: ? ? E ? ? 
      But then R must be at 1,4, or 5? 

      Example: ""STEER"" -> S excluded? Avoid S? 
      ""CREEP"" -> C excluded? 
      ""GREET"" -> G? 
         G R E E T -> duplicate E? 
      ""TREND"" -> N excluded? 

   How about ""PROWL""? doesn't have E? 

   Therefore, E at 4? might be a good choice? 

   Similarly, R at 1? Since it's a common way to start? 

   So going back to: 
        R ? E ? ? -> but then position 3: E? 

        Example: ""RIVER"" -> duplicate R? 
        ""RIPEN"" -> N excluded? 
        ""RIPED"" -> what word? 

   Therefore, perhaps R at 1 and E at 4? 

        Pattern: R ? ? E ? 

        Example: ""ROGUE"": 
          R(1), O(2), G(3), U(4)? -> U excluded? 
        ""ROLEE"" -> duplicate E? 
        ""ROATE""? -> not valid?

        How about ""ROBED"": 
          R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? 
          Avoid exclusions? 
          O? Allowed? Because we haven't excluded O? 
          B? Allowed? 
          D? Allowed? 
          E? at position 4? which is allowed? 

          But note: we tried O? In the second guess? We had ""serum"" and none of the letters were O? So O not excluded? 

          Also, in ""ROBED"": 
             R at 1 -> not tried at 1 before? 
             O at 2 -> new?
             B at 3 -> new?
             E at 4 -> not tried before? 
             D at 5 -> new? 

          But note: we tried E at 2 and 5? Avoided? 
          We tried R at 2 and 3? Avoided? So R at 1? and E at 4? are both new? 

        So ""ROBED"" is a valid word? 

        But let me check: ""ROBED"" means past tense of rob? It's a verb? 

        Alternatively: ""RIDES"" -> 
          R I D E S -> positions: 
            R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), S(5) -> but S excluded? 

          So we must avoid S? 

        Then ""RIFLE"": 
          R(1), I(2), F(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5? Avoided? Because we know E not at 5? 

        ""RIFLE"" is invalid? 

        How about ""RIDGE"": 
          R I D G E -> 
            R(1), I(2), D(3), G(4), E(5) -> E at 5? invalid.

        ""RIPLE"" -> not common? 

        Therefore, ""ROBED"" seems a good option? 
        Alternatively, ""RIPED""? Not a word? 
        Another: ""ROTED""? Not common? 
        ""ROWED"": 
          R O W E D -> 
            R(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), D(5)

        Valid word? meaning ""propel"" a boat? 

        Also, avoids E at 5? 

        But note: we are testing O? which might be a vowel? 

   But wait: in our pattern, we have E at 4? 
   Also, note that we haven't guessed R at 1? So this guess will tell us if R is at position 1? 

   Similarly, we can test if there are T? 

   Given that we haven't tested T? which is common? 

   How about: 
        R at 1? then E at 4? 
        And we want to test T? 

        Example: ""RATED"": 
          R A T E D -> A excluded? 
        ""RITES"": 
          R I T E S -> S excluded? 
        ""RITES"" is invalid because S? 

        How about ""RITEW""? Not a word? 
        ""ROTE"" -> too short? 

        ""RUTED"" -> U excluded? 

        ""ROTEE"" -> duplicate E? 

        Actually, ""R"" at 1, then two letters? then E at 4? and last letter? 
        Example: ""ROTHE""? Not a word? 

        How about ""ROUTE"": 
          R O U T E -> U excluded? 

        Therefore, perhaps ""ROBED"" and ""ROWED"" are acceptable? But note: we haven't used T? 

   Alternatively, we can put R at position 4? And E at position 3? Then: ...? 

      Pattern: ? ? E? R ? ...? 

      Example: ""OFFER"" -> duplicate F? 
          O F E R ? ...? 
          But O at 1? F at 2? E at 3? R at 4? then fifth letter? e.g., ""OFFER"" has five: O F F E R? 
          But duplicate F? and F at 2 and 3? 

      How about ""PILER"" -> 
          P I L E R -> 
            P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), R(5) -> 
            Then R at 5? which is allowed? 
            And E at 4? 

        But wait: E at 4? And the pattern: 
            E: we tried at 2 and 5? Now at 4? 
            R: at 5? we tried R at 2 and 3? but not 5? 

        So ""PILER"" = P I L E R? 
        Valid? meaning one who piles? 

        And letters: P, I, L? We haven't excluded these? 

        Also, introducing L? common? 

   Then ""PILER"" vs ""ROBED"" vs ""ROWED""? 

   We also must consider: we introduced O and B in ""ROBED""? 

   But note: commonality? 

   I think ""ROBED"", ""ROWED"", and ""PILER"" are all acceptable? 

   However, let me think: 
        We know E is not at positions 2 and 5? So only 1,3,4? 
        We know R not at 2 and 3? So only 1,4,5? 

   Now, if in the word ""PILER"":
        E at 4? R at 5?
        So if R is at 5? and E at 4? 

        If the secret word has E at 4? and R at 5? then we would get checks? 

        Also, we can get minuses on P, I, L? 

   Similarly, in ""ROBED"":
        R at 1: if R is at 1? then check? 
        E at 4: if E is at 4? then check? 
        And then we know exactly two positions? 

   So ""ROBED"" has the advantage that we are testing R at a new position (1) and E at a new position (4)? 

   And if they are correct? we win? 

   But note: the secret word might be ""ROBED"" itself? 

   And in ""ROWED"", similarly? R at 1? O at 2? W at 3? E at 4? D at 5? 

   So we can choose ""ROBED""? 

   But note: in the second guess we already used M? which is excluded? So M is out? But ""ROBED"" doesn't have M? 

   So final guess: ""ROBED""

   Reason: 
      - Includes R and E? 
      - Positions: R at 1 (new), E at 4 (new) -> both allowed? 
      - Introduces new letters: O, B, D? 
      - Avoids excluded letters? 
      - Distinct letters? 

   We might get lucky? 

   But there is another possibility: E at 1? 
      Example: ""E? ? R?""? 

      Specifically, E at 1? R at 5? 
        Pattern: E ? ? ? R 

      Example: ""EAGER"" -> A excluded? 
      ""ENTER"" -> N excluded? 
      ""ELDER"" -> L? E? D? E? R? -> duplicate E? 
      ""EMBER"" -> B? 
           E(1), M(2) -> but M excluded? 
      ""EXFER"" -> not a word? 

      Also, E at 1? R at 4? 
        E ? ? R ? 

        ""ELTAR""? Not a word? 
        ""EDGER"" -> G? and D? 
           E(1), D(2), G(3), E(4)? duplicate? 
        ""ERROR"" -> duplicate R? 

      So it's hard? 

   Therefore, I go with ""ROBED"". 

   If not ""ROBED"", maybe ""TREND""? but N excluded? 

   Another: ""GRUEL"" -> G R U E L? U excluded? 

   Therefore, ""ROBED"" seems a solid choice?Based on the feedback from both guesses:

1. **Feedback from ""crane"" (Guess 1):**  
   - R is in the word, but not at position 2.  
   - E is in the word, but not at position 5.  
   - C, A, and N are absent.

2. **Feedback from ""serum"" (Guess 2):**  
   - E is not at position 2.  
   - R is not at position 3.  
   - S, U, and M are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed Letters:** R and E are in the word.  
- **Excluded Letters:** C, A, N, S, U, M.  
- **Constraints:**  
  - R cannot be at positions 2 or 3 (tried and failed).  
  - E cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (tried and failed).  
  - R must be at 1, 4, or 5.  
  - E must be at 1, 3, or 4.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize placing R and E in new, untested positions (e.g., R at 1 or 4; E at 3 or 4).  
- Introduce common letters not excluded (e.g., B, D, O, T) for maximum coverage.  
- Avoid duplicates for clarity.  

The word **""ROBED""** fits perfectly:
- R (position 1): Untested position; avoids 2 and 3.  
- E (position 4): Untested position; avoids 2 and 5.  
- O, B, D: New, common letters not excluded.  
- All letters distinct → clearer feedback.  

This guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while covering additional high-frequency consonants.

<guess>robed</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: serum -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)
Guess 3: robed -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the third guess ""robed"":
  R(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) D(x)

Interpretation:
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got '-' for R at position 1).
- O is not in the word (x).
- B is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) (✓).
- D is not in the word (x).

So now we know:
- The secret word has E at position 4 (because we got a check for E at position 4).
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (and we already knew it's not at 2 or 3 from previous guesses). Therefore, R must be at position 5 (since positions 1,2,3 are tried and failed, and position 4 is taken by E? So the only position left is 5?).
  - Positions: 1: R (tried and got '-') -> not position 1.
  - From guess1: R at position 2 -> not position 2.
  - From guess2: R at position 3 -> not position 3.
  - Position 4 is now occupied by E (and we have a check, so it's fixed). So R cannot be at 4? 
  - Therefore, R must be at position 5.

- Also, we have new exclusions: O, B, D are not in the word. So now the excluded letters are: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D.

- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5? 
  But wait: we haven't tried R at position 5? So we are deducing that R must be at 5? 

  Let me confirm: 
    Positions 1 to 5:
      Position 1: we tried R -> not here and not the only occurrence? But we know R is in the word? and we haven't placed it? 
      We tried R at 1,2,3 -> all wrong. So the only position left is 5? Because position 4 is E? 

  Therefore, the secret word has R at position 5.

- So the secret word pattern: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] E R

- We know letter1, letter2, letter3 are not in the excluded set? And they are not E or R? 

- Excluded letters: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D.

- Available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we must use three of these for positions 1,2,3).

- We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Now, we need to make a guess that fits the pattern: _ _ _ E R

We want to cover common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Common letters that are still available: T, L, I, P, H, G, etc.

We can try a word that has T, L, or other common letters in the first three positions.

Example words ending with ""ER"": 
  - TIGER: T I G E R -> pattern: T at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
    But note: we have the pattern: [1] [2] [3] E R -> so ""TIGER"" fits: T(1), I(2), G(3), E(4), R(5)
    And the letters: T, I, G are not excluded? 
    So we can try ""TIGER"".

  - Other possibilities: 
      ""LIVER"": L I V E R -> but V is available? 
      ""RIVER"": but R is already at 5? and we cannot have R at 1? but we are not putting R at 1? Actually, ""RIVER"" has R at 1 and 5? But we know R is only at 5? and we have E at 4? So ""RIVER"" would be R at 1? which we know is not present? Because we tried R at 1 and got minus? meaning R is not at 1? So ""RIVER"" would have R at 1? which is not allowed? So invalid.

  - ""TIGER"" is a good candidate? 

  - Also, ""PAGER"": P A G E R -> but A is excluded? 
  - ""HOVER"": H O V E R -> O excluded? 
  - ""LOWER"": L O W E R -> O excluded? 
  - ""TAPER"": T A P E R -> A excluded? 
  - ""WIDER"": W I D E R -> D excluded? 
  - ""FILER"": F I L E R -> F, I, L are available? 
  - ""TILER"": T I L E R -> T, I, L available? 
  - ""FIXER"": F I X E R -> F, I, X available? 
  - ""MIXER"": M excluded? 

So among these, ""TIGER"", ""FILER"", ""TILER"", ""FIXER"" are candidates? 

But note: we want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters? 

We can also consider: 
  ""TIGER"" tests T, I, G? 
  ""FILER"" tests F, I, L? 
  ""TILER"" tests T, I, L? 

Since T and L are common? 

But we don't know which one is more likely? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tested? 

But note: we have limited guesses left? 

We have 3 guesses left? (since we are on the fourth guess? We started with 6? and we are about to make the fourth? Actually, we made three: 1. crane, 2. serum, 3. robed -> so next is fourth guess? and we have two more after? 

But we want to solve it quickly? 

Given that we know the pattern is _ _ _ E R, and we have E and R fixed? 

We can try ""TIGER"" and see? 

But note: if ""TIGER"" is the word, we win? 

But if not, we get feedback on T, I, G? 

Similarly, ""TILER"" would test T, I, L? 

I think ""TIGER"" is a common word? 

But let me see: we have excluded many letters? 

The secret word must be a 5-letter word ending with ""ER"", with the third letter not being one of the excluded? 

Possible words: 
  We can list: 
    FIXER? 
    TIGER? 
    TILER? 
    FILER? 
    WIPER? (W is available) 
    HIKER? (H, I, K available) 
    LIKER? 
    RACER? A excluded? 
    MAKER? M excluded? 
    BAKER? B excluded? 
    JOKER? O excluded? 
    POKER? O excluded? 
    RULER? U excluded? 
    SIZER? S excluded? 
    TOWER? O excluded? 
    LOWER? O excluded? 
    POWER? O excluded? 
    HOVER? O excluded? 
    COVER? C and O excluded? 
    MOWER? M and O excluded? 
    DICER? D excluded? 
    NICER? N excluded? 
    RICER? R at 1? but we know R is not at 1? 
    So ""RICER"" is invalid? 

  Therefore, the candidate words are from the available letters? 

  We have: 
    F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

  And the pattern: [1][2][3]ER

  So the first three letters must form a valid 3-letter stem? 

  Common stems: 
    TIG, FIL, TIL, FIX, WIP, HIK, LIK, WIS, etc.

  We can try ""TIGER"" as a guess? 

  But note: we have to avoid using excluded letters? 

  So let's go with ""TIGER"". 

  If it's not the word, we get feedback on T, I, G? 

  We can then use that to narrow down? 

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters? 

  But T, I, G are common? 

  So I'll guess ""TIGER"". 

  But wait: what if the word is ""TILER""? We don't know? 

  But we have to choose one? 

  We can also consider ""WIPER"": 
    W I P E R -> W, I, P? 

  But T is more common than W? 

  So ""TIGER"" is better? 

  Final decision: ""TIGER""

  If the feedback shows that T, I, G are correct? then we win? 

  If not, we get information? 

  But note: we are confident that E and R are fixed? 

  So the guess is ""TIGER"". 

  Format: <guess>tiger</guess>### Analysis of Feedback from Previous Guesses:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - R is in the word but not at position 2.  
   - E is in the word but not at position 5.  
   - C, A, N are absent.  

2. **Guess 2: ""serum""**  
   - E is in the word but not at position 2.  
   - R is in the word but not at position 3.  
   - S, U, M are absent.  

3. **Guess 3: ""robed""**  
   - E is **correct and in position 4** (✓).  
   - R is in the word but not at position 1.  
   - O, B, D are absent.  

### Key Deductions:
- **E is fixed at position 4** (confirmed by ✓ in ""robed"").  
- **R must be at position 5**:  
  - R cannot be at positions 1 (tried in ""robed""), 2 (tried in ""crane""), or 3 (tried in ""serum"").  
  - Position 4 is occupied by E, leaving position 5 as the only possibility.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D.  
- **Secret word pattern**: `[letter1][letter2][letter3] E R`  
  - Letters 1–3 must be from the remaining pool: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, L, G) in positions 1–3.  
- Prioritize common words ending in ""ER"" (e.g., ""TIGER"", ""FILER"", ""TILER"").  
- ""TIGER"" is optimal:  
  - Tests T (position 1), I (position 2), G (position 3) — all common letters.  
  - Fits the pattern `_ _ _ E R` and avoids excluded letters.

But position 3 is new). \n   Also, E is at position 2.\n\n Conditions for positions:\n   - R must not be in position 2 (according to feedback, because in the first guess it was at position 2 and we got \'-\', meaning correct letter but wrong position). \n     So we can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the secret word might have R at 2? Actually, no: because if the secret word had R at 2, then when we guessed R at 2, it would be a check (✓). \n     Since we got a minus, that means the secret word has an R at position 1,3,4, or 5? So let\'s avoid position 2.\n\n   Similarly, E must not be at position 5? Actually, we got a minus for E at position 5? So in the secret word, E is at 1,2,3, or 4? So we avoid E at position 5.\n\n Also, we are avoiding the letters C, A, N.\n\n So, back to ""PERKY"": \n   P E R K Y -> positions: \n     1: P (new)\n     2: E (now in second position -> we don\'t know if that\'s good? We can try)\n     3: R (new position and not 2 -> good)\n     4: K (new)\n     5: Y (new)\n\n But is ""perky"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n However, let me consider if there\'s a better word.\n\n Another word: ""DRIVE"" -> \n   D R I V E\n   R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we know R is not in position 2? So we must avoid putting R at 2.\n\n So ""DRIVE"" has R at 2 -> invalid for our purpose.\n\n Another: ""CRIER"" -> but C is not allowed? We avoid C.\n\n How about ""REMIT"": \n   R E M I T\n   positions: R(1), E(2), M(3), I(4), T(5)\n   E is at 2? Okay. R at 1? Okay. \n   But note: E is at position 2? We don\'t know if that\'s the right position? We might get a check or minus.\n\n   Also, recall that we must avoid E at 5? Here E is at 2? So that\'s okay.\n\n   But wait: what if E is in the secret word at a position other than 5? It might be at 2? We might get a check? Or if not, then minus.\n\n   Let me see: the word ""REMIT"" seems valid? \n\n   But note: we have R at position 1? And we don\'t have any information about position 1? \n\n   However, we must avoid R at position 2? That\'s satisfied.\n\n Another: ""PRICE"" -> but P R I C E: C is not allowed? So invalid.\n\n Another: ""BRIDE"" -> B R I D E: R is at position 2? -> invalid because we must avoid R at 2.\n\n How about ""OWLER""? Not very common. \n\n I think ""REMIT"" is a good candidate? But let\'s check common letters: R and E are already known, and we introduce M, I, T.\n\n Also, we can try ""TREND"": \n   T R E N D -> but N is forbidden? Because in first guess N was marked not present.\n\n Since we are avoiding N, we can\'t use ""TREND"".\n\n Another: ""PEDAL"" -> but A is forbidden? Because A was marked absent in the first guess.\n\n So, going back to ""PERKY"" and ""REMIT"", both are valid? \n\n But note: ""PERKY"" has E at position 2, which we don\'t know about. Same for ""REMIT"" (R at 1, E at 2).\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that puts E at position other than 2 and 5? Like position 1, 3, or 4.\n\n Consider ""HELPS""? Not a 5-letter word? ""HELPS"" is only 5 letters? But H E L P S: E at 2? Still at 2? \n\n How about ""EARTH"" -> avoid: E and A? A is forbidden.\n\n How about ""STERN"": \n   S T E R N -> forbidden N? So no.\n\n ""BIRSE"": meaning? It\'s a word? Let me avoid rare words.\n\n How about ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we avoid R in position 2.\n\n How about ""QUERY"": Q U E R Y -> E at 3? That\'s good. R at 4? Also good? Positions: \n   position1: Q -> uncommon? Maybe not the best.\n   But we avoid R in 2? Yes, R is at 4? Good.\n   E at 3: avoids position 5? Good.\n\n However, Q is uncommon and we might not cover common letters.\n\n Another: ""MERRY"" -> duplicate R? We try to avoid duplicates? Also, E at 2? \n\n Let me think of ""GOURD"": doesn\'t have E? But we must include E.\n\n How about ""VERSE"": duplicate E? Also V E R S E -> E at position 2 and 5? But we cannot have E at 5? So if we have E in position 2 and 5, we avoid E at 5? Actually, the rule says: each letter independently? \n But let\'s check: if we guess two E\'s, and the secret word has one E? Then one E might get a check (if in correct position) and the other might be absent? But the feedback rules: \n\n ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols""\n\n And the example didn\'t cover duplicates? \n\n However, to avoid complexity, I\'ll try a word without duplicates.\n\n So, consider ""ROGUE"": \n   R O G U E -> R at 1, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden? So invalid.\n\n Consider ""OILER"": \n   O I L E R -> E at 4? And R at 5? \n   Positions: \n      1: O\n      2: I\n      3: L\n      4: E\n      5: R -> but R is at the fifth? And we avoid R at 2? But fifth is okay? And E at 4? We avoid E at 5? Yes.\n\n So ""OILER"" is an option? But we don\'t know if that\'s common? And we skip some common letters? \n\n Another: ""BRINE"": but N is forbidden? \n\n We can also try ""HOMER"": \n   H O M E R -> E at 4? R at 5? \n   It includes E and R? And avoids forbidden letters? Yes.\n\n But note: O and M are new?\n\n However, let me compare: I want to test letters that are likely to be in the word? \n\n We know: the word must have R and E? And avoid C, A, N. \n\n Possible vowels: only E? or also others? Might be O, I, U? \n\n Among the common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.\n\n Perhaps we can prioritize those?\n\n After reconsidering, I think ""STARE"" would have been a classic start? But we already started with ""CRANE"", so we have to adapt.\n\n How about ""STOLE"": \n   S T O L E -> E at 5 -> avoid E at 5? So invalid.\n\n ""STILE"": \n   S T I L E -> E at 5 -> avoid.\n\n Then ""STORE"" is invalid? \n\n How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.\n\n Then ""SETTLE"" is 6 letters? \n\n How about ""SPIRE"": \n   S P I R E -> positions: \n     1: S\n     2: P\n     3: I\n     4: R -> R at position 4? (avoided position 2? yes)\n     5: E -> avoid? because E cannot be at 5? So invalid.\n\n Then ""SPREE"": duplicate E? Also E at 5? \n\n Let me try ""SPRUE"": not common.\n\n Given this, I am considering ""REMIT"" again? \n\n Or ""PERCH"": but C is forbidden? \n\n After some thought, I find ""RESTY"": \n   R E S T Y -> positions: \n     1: R -> R at position 1? (avoided position 2? yes)\n     2: E -> E at 2? \n     3: S -> new\n     4: T -> new\n     5: Y -> new\n\n But note: E at 2? We don\'t know? And also, we are avoiding E at 5? But here E is at 2? So that\'s okay? But we need to avoid R at 2? Not violated.\n\n However, in the secret word E cannot be at 5? But we put E at 2? That\'s acceptable.\n\n But wait: what about the R? We are placing R at 1? We know from the previous feedback that R is in the word? But we don\'t know the position? So maybe if we put R at 1 we get a check? That would help.\n\n Similarly, if we get a minus for E at position 2, then we know E is not at 2? \n\n Also, we cover S and T? which are common.\n\n So ""RESTY"" is a valid word? Yes? Meaning: given to rest? \n\n But if not, how about ""RESET""? \n   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4? duplicate E? We avoid duplicates? \n\n Let me avoid duplicates? And ""RESTY"" is a word.\n\n Alternative: ""TRUER"": duplicate R? \n\n Or ""ROBES"": \n   R O B E S -> E at 4? So avoid E at 5? Okay? But R at 1, E at 4? \n   But S is also common? However, duplicate S? No? ROBES: positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5) -> all distinct.\n\n But E at 4? Okay.\n\n Also, we introduce O, B, S.\n\n After comparing: \n   ""RESTY"" = R E S T Y, distinct letters? Yes.\n\n   ""ROBES"" = R O B E S, distinct.\n\n Both are good? \n\n Also, ""TOWER"": \n   T O W E R -> E at 4? But R at 5? And R is repeated? Actually: T, O, W, E, R -> distinct? Yes? \n   But E at 4, R at 5? \n\n Now, we have to decide:\n\n We want to maximize information? \n\n In ""RESTY"", we have R and E? And test S, T, Y? \n\n In ""ROBES"", we test O, B, S? \n\n We already eliminated A, N? So perhaps both are equivalent? But Y is less common? So maybe ""ROBES"" is better? \n\n Another: ""HOUSE"": \n   H O U S E -> E at 5 -> avoid.\n\n How about ""HORDE"": \n   H O R D E -> R at 3? E at 5 -> avoid E at 5.\n\n Difficult.\n\n After rethinking, I think I\'ll go with ""ROBES"" because it covers O and S? and avoids the fifth position for E.\n\n So guess: ""ROBES""\n\n But let me confirm: \n   Positions: \n     position1: R -> we are testing if R is at 1? \n     position2: O -> new\n     position3: B -> new\n     position4: E -> we are testing if E is at 4? \n     position5: S -> new\n\n And we avoid R at 2? Yes? O and B could be new letters? \n\n However, an alternative word: ""SERUM"" -> \n   S E R U M -> \n     S at 1\n     E at 2 -> test E at 2?\n     R at 3 -> avoid R position 2? Yes? \n     U at 4? \n     M at 5?\n\n That is also a possibility? \n\n But we have E at 2? and R at 3? \n\n Comparing: \n   ""SERUM"": S, E, R, U, M\n   ""ROBES"": R, O, B, E, S\n\n We already know the word has R and E? so both use that? \n\n Then which letters do we want to cover? S is common? O is common? \n   SERUM uses U and M? ROBES uses O, B, S? \n\n S is more common than M? So ""SERUM"" might be better? \n\n But ""SERUM"" puts E at 2? In the first guess E was at 5? and now E at 2? \n\n Also, note: in the secret word, E might be at 2? then we get a check? \n\n However, we are free to test E at 2? \n\n Ultimately, I\'ll choose ""SERUM""? \n\n But let me see the letters: \n   By using ""SERUM"" we test: \n        S at 1 -> will it be check? \n        E at 2 -> \n        R at 3 -> note: we know R is not at 2? but R at 3 is new?\n        U at 4? \n        M at 5?\n\n Then we can get information on S, E, R, U, M? \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has the E in a position that we haven\'t guessed? For example, we had E at 5? Now we want to avoid E at 5? Also avoid E at 2? \n\n How about position 1? \n\n Consider ""ELVIS""? Not a word? \n ""EARNS"" -> A forbidden? \n ""EDGES"" -> duplicate E? \n ""EGRET"" -> duplicate E? \n\n How about ""ETHER""? \n   E T H E R -> duplicate E? \n\n How about ""ENROL""? -> uses N? forbidden.\n\n Then I think it\'s difficult to avoid E at 2? \n\n Actually, we know E is not at 5? And we don\'t have any information about other positions? So we can put E at any position except 5? \n\n We have also to consider: if we put E at 1, then we test a new position? \n\n Consider ""ENTRY"" -> N forbidden? \n\n How about ""EMPTY"": \n   E M P T Y -> positions: \n     E at 1? Okay? M at 2? P at 3? T at 4? Y at 5? \n   But then we avoid R? Wait, we know the secret word has R? So we must include R? \n\n Therefore, we cannot skip R? So the word must contain R? \n\n Therefore, the word ""EMPTY"" doesn\'t contain R -> invalid because we know the secret word has R? \n\n So the guess must include R and also E? \n\n Therefore, for our second guess we must have R and E? and avoid C, A, N? \n\n Conclusion: \n   We choose between ""ROBES"" and ""SERUM""? \n\n After careful consideration, I\'ll choose ""SERUM"" because we have R at a position that we haven\'t tried (position 3) and we cover S, U, M? \n\n Also, note that in ""SERUM"": \n   We avoid placing R at position 2 (it\'s at 3) and E at position 5? \n\n So let\'s go with ""SERUM"". \n\n I hope it\'s a valid word? Yes? \n\n Another common word: ""PRIME""? \n   P R I M E -> but R at position 2 -> avoid? So we must avoid R at position 2? So ""PRIME"" has R at 2 -> invalid.\n\n Final decision: ""SERUM""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (symbol: x).\n- R is in the word but **not** in position 2 (symbol: -).\n- E is in the word but **not** in position 5 (symbol: -).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include R and E (as they are in the secret word).\n- Must **avoid** C, A, and N.\n- R cannot be placed in position 2.\n- E cannot be placed in position 5.\n- Prioritize covering new common consonants (e.g., S, T, M) and avoiding duplicates for clarity.\n\nAfter considering words like ""ROBES"" and ""PERKY"", the word **""SERUM""** fits best:\n- Places R in position 3 (new position, avoids position 2).\n- Places E in position 2 (a position not yet tested).\n- Introduces new letters: S, U, M (no C, A, or N).\n- S at position 1, E at position 2, R at position 3, U at position 4, M at position 5—all distinct letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while maximizing coverage of common letters.\n\n<guess>serum</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: serum -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given:\n Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n Guess 2: ""serum"" -> S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)\n\n Interpretation of feedback:\n\n From guess 1:\n   - R is in the word, not at position 2.\n   - E is in the word, not at position 5.\n   - C, A, N are not in the word.\n\n From guess 2:\n   - S(x): S is not in the word.\n   - E(-): E is in the word but not at position 2 (because we guessed E at position 2 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not here).\n   - R(-): R is in the word but not at position 3 (because we guessed R at position 3 and got \'-\').\n   - U(x): U is not in the word.\n   - M(x): M is not in the word.\n\n Therefore, we now know:\n   - The secret word contains R and E (from both guesses), but not at the positions we\'ve tried so far.\n   - We know the secret word does NOT contain: C, A, N, S, U, M (from the x\'s).\n\n Also, positions of R and E that have been tried and are incorrect:\n   - R was tried at position 2 (from ""crane"") and position 3 (from ""serum"") -> both are incorrect. So R must be at position 1, 4, or 5? Because in a 5-letter word the positions are 1 to 5.\n   - E at position 5 (from ""crane"") and position 2 (from ""serum"") -> both are incorrect. So E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.\n\n Additionally, we have exclusions for letters: C, A, N, S, U, M.\n\n The word must have exactly 5 letters, including R and E, and three others that are not in the exclusions.\n\n We need to form a guess that:\n   - Uses only letters not excluded: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and of course R and E).\n   - Places R only at positions 1, 4, or 5? Because we tried 2 and 3? And similarly E at 1, 3, 4? (avoiding 2 and 5).\n\n Since the secret word must contain both R and E, and we have two letters known, we have three positions left? But the word can have other repeated letters? However, we haven\'t encountered duplicates yet? But the feedback doesn\'t forbid it? So the word might have duplicate letters? But let us proceed without assuming duplicates? We can try a word with distinct letters to avoid confusion? \n\n However, in this case, we have only R and E known? But the secret word might have other letters? \n\n We need to cover more common letters? \n\n Specifically, we can try to include common consonants: T, L, etc.\n\n But note: we cannot place E at position 2 or 5? And R at position 2 or 3? So for our next guess, we must choose positions for R and E from the allowed ones? And introduce three new letters?\n\n How about:\n\n   Place R at position 1? Then E at position 3 or 4? \n\n   Or R at position 4? Then E at position 1 or 3?\n\n   Or R at position 5? Then E at position 1 or 3 or 4?\n\n Example word: if R at position 1, E at position 3? Then we can have: R ? E ? ?\n\n We have to fill the blanks? \n\n Possibilities:\n\n   Position 1: R\n   Position 3: E\n\n Then we need letters for positions 2,4,5? \n\n Position 2: must be a letter not excluded? And we don\'t know if it\'s E? But E cannot be at position 2? Because E(-) at position 2 in the second guess? So E is not at 2? Therefore, we use a different letter? \n\n Similarly, let\'s form a word:\n\n   R, [letter2], E, [letter4], [letter5]\n\n Example: ""RIPER""? \n   But duplicates? E might appear twice? We don\'t want duplicates? Also, ""I"", ""P"", ""E"", ""R"" -> but E at position 5? Avoid E at 5? Because from first guess we know E is not at 5? So ""RIPER"" has E at 5? -> invalid?\n\n How about ""RIVET""? \n   R:I:V:E:T -> positions: \n     1: R\n     2: I\n     3: V? wait: no, we want E at 3? \n   Actually, positions: \n     1: R -> allowed\n     2: I -> must not be E? okay, because E not at 2? \n     3: E -> allowed? (since E can be at 3? because we tried E only at 2 and 5)\n     4: E? ... wait: ""RIVET"" has letters: R, I, V, E, T -> which positions?\n         R (1), I (2), V (3), E (4), T (5) -> then E is at position 4? which is allowed? \n   How about E at 4? That is allowed? \n\n   But wait: we want E at 4? That works? \n\n   So ""RIVET"": \n        R(1), I(2), V(3), E(4), T(5)\n\n   This avoids:\n        R at 2 and 3? Here R is at 1 -> not tried for R? (we tried position 2 and 3? but not 1) \n        E at 5? Avoided? We have E at 4 -> okay? \n        E at 2? Avoided.\n\n   Also, introduces I, V, T? \n\n   But note: E is at 4? and R at 1? \n\n   Another: ""RILED"": \n        R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5) -> same pattern? E at 4.\n\n   Another: ""RIDER"" -> duplicate R? \n\n   But note: the word must not have excluded letters? So ""RIVET"" is acceptable? \n\n   However, we have T at 5? That is okay? \n\n   But we don\'t know about E at 4? \n\n Alternatively, if R is at position 4? Then we can have: \n   ... \n   For example: _ _ _ R _? \n   And we know E must be at 1? or 3? because E can be at 1,3,4? But if R is at 4? then E cannot be at 4? So E at 1 or 3? \n\n   Example: ""BOXER"" -> excludes: letter B? not excluded? but we haven\'t eliminated B? \n        B O X E R -> \n          B(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), R(5) -> \n          R at 5: we haven\'t tried? \n          E at 4: we haven\'t tried? \n        But note: in ""BOXER"", E is at 4? and R at 5? which are allowed? \n        And we avoid E at 5? \n        And avoid R at 2 and 3? \n\n        Also, positions: \n          4: E? -> but wait: we have E at 4? which is a new position? \n          5: R -> new.\n\n        The word contains E and R? \n        And letters B, O, X? \n\n        However, X is uncommon? \n\n   Also, we have E at 4? which is the same as ""RIVET""? \n\n   But note: we need to choose a word that maximizes new letters? and common letters? \n\n   Let\'s compare: \n        ""RIVET"": letters R, I, V, E, T -> testing I, V, T? \n        ""BOXER"": letters B, O, X, E, R -> testing B, O, X? \n\n   We might prefer T because it is common? \n\n   Also, we can consider words that put E at positions 1 or 3? \n\n   For example: \n        E at 1? \n        Then we can have: E ? ? ? ? \n        Also, R must be at 4 or 5? \n\n        Example: ""ELDER"" -> \n           E(1), L(2), D(3), E(4)? -> wait, E at 1 and 4? duplicate? \n           Also, R at 5? So ""ELDER"" = E(1) L(2) D(3) E(4) [but actually it should be E(1), L(2), D(3), E(4), R(5)]? Wait, ""ELDER"" does not end with R? \n\n        ""ELDER"" is E L D E R? -> E at 1 and 4? R at 5? So we have E at 1? But also E at 4? \n\n        However, we know E is in the word? but we don\'t know if it is repeated? So we must avoid duplicates? Because if the word has only one E? then we might get confusing feedback? \n\n        So it\'s risky? \n\n   Therefore, to keep distinct letters? We can choose a word without duplicates? \n\n   So let us avoid duplicates? \n\n   Possibility: E at 1? \n      Then: E, [letter2], [letter3], [letter4], [letter5]? \n      Letter2: must be a consonant? and not excluded? \n      Letter3: R? Not possible because R is not allowed at position 3? We tried R at 3 and it was wrong? So R cannot be at 3? Therefore, R must be at 4 or 5? \n\n      Example: ""EATER"" -> duplicates? \n      ""ETHER"" -> duplicates?\n\n   How about ""EERIE""? duplicates.\n\n   Example without duplicate: ""EQUAL"" -> E Q U A L -> but U excluded? and A excluded? \n\n   ""ETHYL"": E T H Y L -> \n        positions: E(1), T(2), H(3), Y(4), L(5) -> does not have R! -> invalid? because must have R? \n\n   Therefore, any guess must include R? So we can\'t skip R? \n\n   Then for E at position 1? the word must have R at 4 or 5? \n\n   Example: ""ENTRY"" -> N excluded? \n   ""ERROR"" -> duplicate R? \n\n   So it\'s really hard? \n\n   Alternatively, E at position 3? \n\n      Pattern: ? ? E ? ? \n      But then R must be at 1,4, or 5? \n\n      Example: ""STEER"" -> S excluded? Avoid S? \n      ""CREEP"" -> C excluded? \n      ""GREET"" -> G? \n         G R E E T -> duplicate E? \n      ""TREND"" -> N excluded? \n\n   How about ""PROWL""? doesn\'t have E? \n\n   Therefore, E at 4? might be a good choice? \n\n   Similarly, R at 1?

E ? ? -> but then position 3: E? \n\n        Example: ""RIVER"" -> duplicate R? \n        ""RIPEN"" -> N excluded? \n        ""RIPED"" -> what word? \n\n   Therefore, perhaps R at 1 and E at 4? \n\n        Pattern: R ? ? E ? \n\n        Example: ""ROGUE"": \n          R(1), O(2), G(3), U(4)? -> U excluded? \n        ""ROLEE"" -> duplicate E? \n        ""ROATE""? -> not valid?\n\n        How about ""ROBED"": \n          R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? \n          Avoid exclusions? \n          O? Allowed? Because we haven\'t excluded O? \n          B? Allowed? \n          D? Allowed? \n          E? at position 4? which is allowed? \n\n          But note: we tried O? In the second guess? We had ""serum"" and none of the letters were O? So O not excluded? \n\n          Also, in ""ROBED"": \n             R at 1 -> not tried at 1 before? \n             O at 2 -> new?\n             B at 3 -> new?\n             E at 4 -> not tried before? \n             D at 5 -> new? \n\n          But note: we tried E at 2 and 5? Avoided? \n          We tried R at 2 and 3? Avoided? So R at 1? and E at 4? are both new? \n\n        So ""ROBED"" is a valid word? \n\n        But let me check: ""ROBED"" means past tense of rob? It\'s a verb? \n\n        Alternatively: ""RIDES"" -> \n          R I D E S -> positions: \n            R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), S(5) -> but S excluded? \n\n          So we must avoid S? \n\n        Then ""RIFLE"": \n          R(1), I(2), F(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5? Avoided? Because we know E not at 5? \n\n        ""RIFLE"" is invalid? \n\n        How about ""RIDGE"": \n          R I D G E -> \n            R(1), I(2), D(3), G(4), E(5) -> E at 5? invalid.\n\n        ""RIPLE"" -> not common? \n\n        Therefore, ""ROBED"" seems a good option? \n        Alternatively, ""RIPED""? Not a word? \n        Another: ""ROTED""? Not common? \n        ""ROWED"": \n          R O W E D -> \n            R(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), D(5)\n\n        Valid word? meaning ""propel"" a boat? \n\n        Also, avoids E at 5? \n\n        But note: we are testing O? which might be a vowel? \n\n   But wait: in our pattern, we have E at 4? \n   Also, note that we haven\'t guessed R at 1? So this guess will tell us if R is at position 1? \n\n   Similarly, we can test if there are T? \n\n   Given that we haven\'t tested T? which is common? \n\n   How about: \n        R at 1? then E at 4? \n        And we want to test T? \n\n        Example: ""RATED"": \n          R A T E D -> A excluded? \n        ""RITES"": \n          R I T E S -> S excluded? \n        ""RITES"" is invalid because S? \n\n        How about ""RITEW""?

Not a word? \n\n        How about ""ROUTE"": \n          R O U T E -> U excluded? \n\n        Therefore, perhaps ""ROBED"" and ""ROWED"" are acceptable? But note: we haven\'t used T? \n\n   Alternatively, we can put R at position 4? And E at position 3? Then: ...? \n\n      Pattern: ? ? E? R ? ...? \n\n      Example: ""OFFER"" -> duplicate F? \n          O F E R ? ...? \n          But O at 1? F at 2? E at 3? R at 4? then fifth letter? e.g., ""OFFER"" has five: O F F E R? \n          But duplicate F? and F at 2 and 3? \n\n      How about ""PILER"" -> \n          P I L E R -> \n            P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), R(5) -> \n            Then R at 5? which is allowed? \n            And E at 4? \n\n        But wait: E at 4? And the pattern: \n            E: we tried at 2 and 5? Now at 4? \n            R: at 5? we tried R at 2 and 3? but not 5? \n\n        So ""PILER"" = P I L E R? \n        Valid? meaning one who piles? \n\n        And letters: P, I, L? We haven\'t excluded these? \n\n        Also, introducing L? common? \n\n   Then ""PILER"" vs ""ROBED"" vs ""ROWED""? \n\n   We also must consider: we introduced O and B in ""ROBED""? \n\n   But note: commonality? \n\n   I think ""ROBED"", ""ROWED"", and ""PILER"" are all acceptable? \n\n   However, let me think: \n        We know E is not at positions 2 and 5? So only 1,3,4? \n        We know R not at 2 and 3? So only 1,4,5? \n\n   Now, if in the word ""PILER"":\n        E at 4? R at 5?\n        So if R is at 5? and E at 4? \n\n        If the secret word has E at 4? and R at 5? then we would get checks? \n\n        Also, we can get minuses on P, I, L? \n\n   Similarly, in ""ROBED"":\n        R at 1: if R is at 1? then check? \n        E at 4: if E is at 4? then check? \n        And then we know exactly two positions? \n\n   So ""ROBED"" has the advantage that we are testing R at a new position (1) and E at a new position (4)? \n\n   And if they are correct? we win? \n\n   But note: the secret word might be ""ROBED"" itself? \n\n   And in ""ROWED"", similarly? R at 1? O at 2? W at 3? E at 4? D at 5? \n\n   So we can choose ""ROBED""? \n\n   But note: in the second guess we already used M? which is excluded? So M is out? But ""ROBED"" doesn\'t have M? \n\n   So final guess: ""ROBED""\n\n   Reason: \n      - Includes R and E? \n      - Positions: R at 1 (new), E at 4 (new) -> both allowed? \n      - Introduces new letters: O, B, D? \n      - Avoids excluded letters? \n      - Distinct letters? \n\n   We might get lucky? \n\n   But there is another possibility: E at 1? \n      Example: ""E? ? R?""? \n\n      Specifically, E at 1? R at 5? \n        Pattern: E ? ? ? R \n\n      Example: ""EAGER"" -> A excluded? \n      ""ENTER"" -> N excluded? \n      ""ELDER"" -> L? E? D? E? R? -> duplicate E? \n      ""EMBER"" -> B? \n           E(1), M(2) -> but M excluded? \n      ""EXFER"" -> not a word? \n\n      Also, E at 1? R at 4? \n        E ? ? R ? \n\n        ""ELTAR""? Not a word? \n        ""EDGER"" -> G? and D? \n           E(1), D(2), G(3), E(4)? duplicate? \n        ""ERROR"" -> duplicate R? \n\n      So it\'s hard? \n\n   Therefore, I go with ""ROBED"". \n\n   If not ""ROBED"", maybe ""TREND""? but N excluded? \n\n   Another: ""GRUEL"" -> G R U E L? U excluded? \n\n   Therefore, ""ROBED"" seems a solid choice?Based on the feedback from both guesses:\n\n1. **Feedback from ""crane"" (Guess 1):**  \n   - R is in the word, but not at position 2.  \n   - E is in the word, but not at position 5.  \n   - C, A, and N are absent.\n\n2. **Feedback from ""serum"" (Guess 2):**  \n   - E is not at position 2.  \n   - R is not at position 3.  \n   - S, U, and M are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed Letters:** R and E are in the word.  \n- **Excluded Letters:** C, A, N, S, U, M.  \n- **Constraints:**  \n  - R cannot be at positions 2 or 3 (tried and failed).  \n  - E cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (tried and failed).  \n  - R must be at 1, 4, or 5.  \n  - E must be at 1, 3, or 4.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Prioritize placing R and E in new, untested positions (e.g., R at 1 or 4; E at 3 or 4).  \n- Introduce common letters not excluded (e.g., B, D, O, T) for maximum coverage.  \n- Avoid duplicates for clarity.  \n\nThe word **""ROBED""** fits perfectly:\n- R (position 1): Untested position; avoids 2 and 3.  \n- E (position 4): Untested position; avoids 2 and 5.  \n- O, B, D: New, common letters not excluded.  \n- All letters distinct → clearer feedback.  \n\nThis guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while covering additional high-frequency consonants.\n\n<guess>robed</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: serum -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)\nGuess 3: robed -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the feedback for the third guess ""robed"":\n  R(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) D(x)\n\nInterpretation:\n- R is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got \'-\' for R at position 1).\n- O is not in the word (x).\n- B is not in the word (x).\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) (✓).\n- D is not in the word (x).\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has E at position 4 (because we got a check for E at position 4).\n- R is in the word but not at position 1 (and we already knew it\'s not at 2 or 3 from previous guesses).

We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""tiger"":
  T(x) I(-) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)

Interpretation:
- T is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but not at position 2 (because we guessed I at position 2 and got '-').
- G is not in the word (x).
- E is correct at position 4 (✓) — we already knew this.
- R is correct at position 5 (✓) — we just confirmed R at position 5.

So now we know:
- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5. So the pattern is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] E R.
- I is in the word, but not at position 2.
- T and G are not in the word (new exclusions).

Updated exclusions: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D, T, G.

Available letters: F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that I is in the word, so it must be in one of the first three positions. But we know it's not at position 2 (from the feedback of ""tiger""). Therefore, I must be at position 1 or 3.

So the pattern is:
  Position 1: either I or another letter (but if not I, then I must be at position 3)
  Position 2: a letter that is not I (and not excluded)
  Position 3: if position 1 is not I, then it must be I; otherwise, it can be another letter.

But note: the word must contain I, so it must appear in either position 1 or 3.

We can break it into two cases:

Case 1: I at position 1.
  Pattern: I [letter2] [letter3] E R

Case 2: I at position 3.
  Pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I E R

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses the available letters.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words for each case:

Case 1: I at position 1.
  Examples:
    ""I"" + ? + ? + ""ER""
    We need two letters for positions 2 and 3 from the available set (excluding I? but I is at 1, so positions 2 and 3 are different letters).

    Possible words:
      ""INKER"": I N K E R -> but N is excluded? (from guess1: N(x)) -> invalid.
      ""ILLER"": I L L E R -> duplicate L? and L is available? but we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, the feedback rules don't forbid duplicates? But we haven't encountered one? 
        But note: ""ILLER"" is a word? (meaning one who makes ill? not common) 
        Also, we have L at position 2 and 3? 
      ""IMPER"": I M P E R -> M excluded? 
      ""IDLER"": I D L E R -> D excluded? 
      ""INFER"": I N F E R -> N excluded? 
      ""INTER"": I N T E R -> N and T excluded? 
      ""ICIER"": I C I E R -> C excluded and duplicate I? 
      ""PILER"": we thought earlier? but P is available? but pattern: I at 1? then ""PILER"" doesn't fit? 
      How about ""HIVER"": H I V E R -> but I is at position 2? not 1? 
      ""WIPER"": W I P E R -> I at position 2? not 1? 

    Actually, we need I at 1: 
      ""IKLER""? not a word? 
      ""IFLER""? not a word? 
      ""IWLER""? not a word? 

    It's hard? 

    Another: ""IXLER""? not a word? 

    How about ""JIVER""? J I V E R -> I at 2? 
    ""JIVER"" is not I at 1? 

    Let me think: 
      ""INNER"" -> N excluded? 
      ""ILLER"" as above? 
      ""INVER""? not common? 

    Perhaps ""ILLER"" is the only candidate? But duplicate L? 

    But note: we haven't excluded L? So it's possible? 

    However, we are not sure? 

Case 2: I at position 3.
  Pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I E R

  Examples:
    ""DAZIR""? not a word? 
    ""PENIR""? not a word? 
    ""VALID"": V A L I D -> A excluded? 
    ""HELIR""? not a word? 
    ""FELIR""? not a word? 

    More common: 
      ""FLAIR"": F L A I R -> A excluded? 
      ""PRIOR"": P R I O R -> O excluded? 
      ""TRIOR""? not a word? 
      ""FLIER"": F L I E R -> but note: pattern is [1][2]IER? 
          F(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), R(5) -> matches? 
          And F and L are available? 
          So ""FLIER"" is a candidate? 

      ""FLYER"": F L Y E R -> 
          F(1), L(2), Y(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we need I at 3? This has Y at 3? 
          So not? 

      ""PLIER"": P L I E R -> 
          P(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), R(5) -> matches? 
          P and L available? 

      ""JHIER""? not a word? 

      ""WHIZR""? not a word? 

      ""WRIER"": W R I E R -> but R at position 2? and we know R is only at 5? so R cannot be at 2? 
          Also, duplicate R? 

      ""PRIED"": P R I E D -> D excluded? 
      ""FRIED"": F R I E D -> D excluded? 
      ""PLIED"": P L I E D -> D excluded? 

      So without D? 

      ""FLIER"" and ""PLIER"" are candidates? 

      Also, ""LIER"": too short? 
      ""ELIER""? E at 1? but we have E at 4? and we don't know if E can be duplicated? 
          But ""ELIER"" would be E L I E R -> duplicate E? 
          And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

      But note: we have not seen any duplicate in feedback? 

      However, the rules don't say they are forbidden? 

      But to be safe, let's avoid duplicates? 

      So ""FLIER"" and ""PLIER"" are good? 

      Also, ""JIVER"": J I V E R -> I at 2? not 3? 
      ""WIVER""? not a word? 
      ""HIVER"": H I V E R -> I at 2? 

      ""FIXER"": F I X E R -> I at 2? not 3? 

      ""MINER"": M excluded? 

      So the candidates are ""FLIER"" and ""PLIER"". 

Now, we have two cases? 
  Case 1: I at 1 -> candidate ""ILLER"" (with duplicate L) 
  Case 2: I at 3 -> candidates ""FLIER"", ""PLIER""

But note: in case 1, ""ILLER"" is not a common word? and we have duplicate L? 

In case 2, ""FLIER"" and ""PLIER"" are more common? 

But we don't know which case? 

We need a guess that can help distinguish? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? 

But note: we have only two guesses left? (if we are on the fifth guess? we started with 6, so after 4 we have 2 left?).

We can try a word that has I at position 1? and also tests other letters? 

But we don't have many candidates? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't necessarily have I? but we know I is in the word? so we must include I? 

Therefore, we must include I? 

So we have to choose between the patterns? 

But note: we can also try a word that has I at position 3? and tests new letters? 

For example, ""PLIER"" or ""FLIER""? 

But if we choose ""FLIER"", then:
  Pattern: F L I E R
  We test:
    F at 1: if it's present? 
    L at 2: if it's present? 
    I at 3: we know I is in the word? and if we get a check? then we know I is at 3? 
    E and R are fixed? 

If we get feedback:
  If F is absent? then we know F is not in the word? 
  If L is absent? then L is not? 
  If I is at 3? then we get a check? 

But if I is not at 3? then we get a minus? meaning I is at 1? 

So we can get information? 

Similarly, if we choose ""PLIER"", same thing? 

But note: we don't have to use the exact pattern? We can use a word that has I at position 1? to test that case? 

But we don't have a good candidate for I at 1? 

Therefore, I think it's better to test the case for I at 3? because we have common words? 

We can choose ""FLIER"" or ""PLIER""? 

Which one? 
  ""FLIER"" uses F and L? 
  ""PLIER"" uses P and L? 

Both L is common? 

But F and P are of similar frequency? 

We can choose ""FLIER""? 

But note: we have not used F? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried? 

We have tried: 
  crane: C, R, A, N, E
  serum: S, E, R, U, M
  robed: R, O, B, E, D
  tiger: T, I, G, E, R

So we have not tried: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

So F and L are new? 

Similarly, P and L are new? 

So both are good? 

I'll choose ""FLIER"". 

But wait: the pattern for ""FLIER"" is F L I E R? 
  Position 1: F
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: E (fixed)
  Position 5: R (fixed)

If the secret word is ""FLIER"", we win? 

If not, we get feedback on F, L, I? 

Specifically, if I is at 3? we get a check? and then we know I is at 3? and we can look for other words? 

If I is not at 3? we get a minus? meaning I is at 1? and then we know the pattern is I [letter2] [letter3] E R? 

And we can then guess accordingly? 

So ""FLIER"" is a good guess? 

But note: what if the word is ""PLIER""? Then we would get feedback that F is absent? and L is present? and I at 3? 

But then we can guess ""PLIER"" next? 

So let's go with ""FLIER"". 

But wait: is ""FLIER"" a valid word? Yes? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't fix I at 3? but tests other positions? 

But we have to include I? 

Another idea: we can try a word that has I at position 1? and also tests new letters? 

For example, ""IVIER""? not a word? 

""ICHOR"": I C H O R -> C and O excluded? 

""IDYLR""? not a word? 

""IGLUR""? not a word? 

So I think ""FLIER"" is a better choice? 

Final guess: ""FLIER"" 

But note: the pattern we are guessing is F L I E R? 

We hope that if it's not the word, we get feedback that helps? 

So <guess>flier</guess>

### Analysis of Feedback from Previous Guesses:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - R is in the word but not at position 2.  
   - E is in the word but not at position 5.  
   - C, A, N are absent.  

2. **Guess 2: ""serum""**  
   - E is not at position 2.  
   - R is not at position 3.  
   - S, U, M are absent.  

3. **Guess 3: ""robed""**  
   - E is **correct at position 4** (✓).  
   - R is in the word but not at position 1.  
   - O, B, D are absent.  

4. **Guess 4: ""tiger""**  
   - E is **correct at position 4** (✓) — confirmed again.  
   - R is **correct at position 5** (✓) — new confirmation.  
   - I is in the word but not at position 2.  
   - T, G are absent.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Fixed Positions**:  
  - Position 4: E (✓)  
  - Position 5: R (✓)  
- **I is present** but not at position 2 → must be at position 1 or 3.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D, T, G.  
- **Secret word pattern**: `[letter1][letter2][letter3] E R`  
  - Available letters: F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  - I must be in position 1 or 3.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **I at position 3** (since position 2 is ruled out) and cover new high-frequency letters.  
- **""FLIER""** fits perfectly:  
  - F (position 1): Tests a new common consonant.  
  - L (position 2): Tests a high-frequency consonant.  
  - I (position 3): Tests the critical position for I.  
  - E and R (positions 4–5) are fixed.  
- If I is at position 3, we get confirmation. If not, I must be at position 1 (narrows to words like ""I____ER"").  

<guess>flier</guess>",flier,"We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""tiger"":
  T(x) I(-) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)

Interpretation:
- T is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but not at position 2 (because we guessed I at position 2 and got '-').
- G is not in the word (x).
- E is correct at position 4 (✓) — we already knew this.
- R is correct at position 5 (✓) — we just confirmed R at position 5.

So now we know:
- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5. So the pattern is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] E R.
- I is in the word, but not at position 2.
- T and G are not in the word (new exclusions).

Updated exclusions: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D, T, G.

Available letters: F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that I is in the word, so it must be in one of the first three positions. But we know it's not at position 2 (from the feedback of ""tiger""). Therefore, I must be at position 1 or 3.

So the pattern is:
  Position 1: either I or another letter (but if not I, then I must be at position 3)
  Position 2: a letter that is not I (and not excluded)
  Position 3: if position 1 is not I, then it must be I; otherwise, it can be another letter.

But note: the word must contain I, so it must appear in either position 1 or 3.

We can break it into two cases:

Case 1: I at position 1.
  Pattern: I [letter2] [letter3] E R

Case 2: I at position 3.
  Pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I E R

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses the available letters.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words for each case:

Case 1: I at position 1.
  Examples:
    ""I"" + ? + ? + ""ER""
    We need two letters for positions 2 and 3 from the available set (excluding I? but I is at 1, so positions 2 and 3 are different letters).

    Possible words:
      ""INKER"": I N K E R -> but N is excluded? (from guess1: N(x)) -> invalid.
      ""ILLER"": I L L E R -> duplicate L? and L is available? but we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, the feedback rules don't forbid duplicates? But we haven't encountered one? 
        But note: ""ILLER"" is a word? (meaning one who makes ill? not common) 
        Also, we have L at position 2 and 3? 
      ""IMPER"": I M P E R -> M excluded? 
      ""IDLER"": I D L E R -> D excluded? 
      ""INFER"": I N F E R -> N excluded? 
      ""INTER"": I N T E R -> N and T excluded? 
      ""ICIER"": I C I E R -> C excluded and duplicate I? 
      ""PILER"": we thought earlier? but P is available? but pattern: I at 1? then ""PILER"" doesn't fit? 
      How about ""HIVER"": H I V E R -> but I is at position 2? not 1? 
      ""WIPER"": W I P E R -> I at position 2? not 1? 

    Actually, we need I at 1: 
      ""IKLER""? not a word? 
      ""IFLER""? not a word? 
      ""IWLER""? not a word? 

    It's hard? 

    Another: ""IXLER""? not a word? 

    How about ""JIVER""? J I V E R -> I at 2? 
    ""JIVER"" is not I at 1? 

    Let me think: 
      ""INNER"" -> N excluded? 
      ""ILLER"" as above? 
      ""INVER""? not common? 

    Perhaps ""ILLER"" is the only candidate? But duplicate L? 

    But note: we haven't excluded L? So it's possible? 

    However, we are not sure? 

Case 2: I at position 3.
  Pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I E R

  Examples:
    ""DAZIR""? not a word? 
    ""PENIR""? not a word? 
    ""VALID"": V A L I D -> A excluded? 
    ""HELIR""? not a word? 
    ""FELIR""? not a word? 

    More common: 
      ""FLAIR"": F L A I R -> A excluded? 
      ""PRIOR"": P R I O R -> O excluded? 
      ""TRIOR""? not a word? 
      ""FLIER"": F L I E R -> but note: pattern is [1][2]IER? 
          F(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), R(5) -> matches? 
          And F and L are available? 
          So ""FLIER"" is a candidate? 

      ""FLYER"": F L Y E R -> 
          F(1), L(2), Y(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we need I at 3? This has Y at 3? 
          So not? 

      ""PLIER"": P L I E R -> 
          P(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), R(5) -> matches? 
          P and L available? 

      ""JHIER""? not a word? 

      ""WHIZR""? not a word? 

      ""WRIER"": W R I E R -> but R at position 2? and we know R is only at 5? so R cannot be at 2? 
          Also, duplicate R? 

      ""PRIED"": P R I E D -> D excluded? 
      ""FRIED"": F R I E D -> D excluded? 
      ""PLIED"": P L I E D -> D excluded? 

      So without D? 

      ""FLIER"" and ""PLIER"" are candidates? 

      Also, ""LIER"": too short? 
      ""ELIER""? E at 1? but we have E at 4? and we don't know if E can be duplicated? 
          But ""ELIER"" would be E L I E R -> duplicate E? 
          And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

      But note: we have not seen any duplicate in feedback? 

      However, the rules don't say they are forbidden? 

      But to be safe, let's avoid duplicates? 

      So ""FLIER"" and ""PLIER"" are good? 

      Also, ""JIVER"": J I V E R -> I at 2? not 3? 
      ""WIVER""? not a word? 
      ""HIVER"": H I V E R -> I at 2? 

      ""FIXER"": F I X E R -> I at 2? not 3? 

      ""MINER"": M excluded? 

      So the candidates are ""FLIER"" and ""PLIER"". 

Now, we have two cases? 
  Case 1: I at 1 -> candidate ""ILLER"" (with duplicate L) 
  Case 2: I at 3 -> candidates ""FLIER"", ""PLIER""

But note: in case 1, ""ILLER"" is not a common word? and we have duplicate L? 

In case 2, ""FLIER"" and ""PLIER"" are more common? 

But we don't know which case? 

We need a guess that can help distinguish? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? 

But note: we have only two guesses left? (if we are on the fifth guess? we started with 6, so after 4 we have 2 left?).

We can try a word that has I at position 1? and also tests other letters? 

But we don't have many candidates? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't necessarily have I? but we know I is in the word? so we must include I? 

Therefore, we must include I? 

So we have to choose between the patterns? 

But note: we can also try a word that has I at position 3? and tests new letters? 

For example, ""PLIER"" or ""FLIER""? 

But if we choose ""FLIER"", then:
  Pattern: F L I E R
  We test:
    F at 1: if it's present? 
    L at 2: if it's present? 
    I at 3: we know I is in the word? and if we get a check? then we know I is at 3? 
    E and R are fixed? 

If we get feedback:
  If F is absent? then we know F is not in the word? 
  If L is absent? then L is not? 
  If I is at 3? then we get a check? 

But if I is not at 3? then we get a minus? meaning I is at 1? 

So we can get information?

So F and L are new?

I'll choose ""FLIER"". 

But wait: the pattern for ""FLIER"" is F L I E R?

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,PLIER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is not in the secret word (x)
 - R is in the word but not in the correct position (-)
 - A is not in the word (x)
 - N is not in the word (x)
 - E is in the word but not in the correct position (-)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they appear in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

 Since we are making the second guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
 1. Includes R and E (because they are present in the secret word).
 2. Does not include C, A, or N.
 3. Places R in a position other than the second, and E in a position other than the fifth.

 Also, we should try to cover more common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that contain R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

 Possible vowels: We have E already, but we might need others (like I, O, U). Since A is out, we can try I or O.

 Common consonants besides R: S, T, L, etc.

 Example words: 
   ""ROUSE"": contains R, O, U, S, E -> but note the positions: R is first, E is fifth? 
     However, in our feedback, E is already known to not be fifth, so we cannot place E in the fifth position.

 Similarly, we must avoid placing R in the second position.

 Let's try to think of words with R and E, E not at the end, and R not at the second position.

 Alternatives:
   ""RESET"" -> But E is at positions 2 and 4? We don't know about multiple letters yet. Also, we might have duplicated letters?
   However, in the first guess the word had distinct letters, but the secret word might have duplicates.

 But note: in the feedback, we got two minuses for R and E, but we don't know if the secret word has multiple of these.

 Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. But we don't know.

 Since we are still early, it's better to try words without duplicates to get clearer information.

 However, let me check the rules: no mention if duplicates are allowed. Actually, Wordle does allow duplicated letters? 
 But typically, the secret word can have duplicate letters? Actually, the rules don't specify. But since the example didn't have duplicates, and in Wordle the secret word may have duplicates, but we must be cautious.

 Considering the feedback: if the same letter appears multiple times in the guess, then the feedback for that letter might be counted independently.

 However, to keep it simple for now, let's try to avoid duplicates.

 So, we need a word that:
   - Contains R and E (and three other letters not in {C, A, N})
   - R must not be in position 2 (but note: in our guess, position 2 is the second letter? Remember the indexing: guess was ""C R A N E"", so positions: 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E).
   - E must not be in position 5.

 And we want to maximize the possibility of covering new common letters.

 How about trying the letter O and T? 

 Consider ""ROUTE"": 
   R is at position 1 -> okay because in the first guess R was at position 2 and now we move it to 1? 
   But note: the feedback only said the secret word has R, so we can try any position except 2? Actually, we only avoid putting R at position 2? 
   What if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we would get a check.

   E is at position 5 -> but we know from feedback that E is not at position 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""ROUTE"" is not acceptable because E is at fifth.

 Another idea: ""STORE"" -> 
   positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)
   E at 5 -> invalid.

 We must avoid having E at fifth.

 How about ""STIRE""? That's not a word? 

 Let me think of words with E in the beginning or middle.

 Examples: 
   ""PERKY"": P E R K Y -> R at position 3 (was position 2 in first guess, so avoid that? Actually, we avoid position 2? But position 3 is new). 
   Also, E is at position 2.

 Conditions for positions:
   - R must not be in position 2 (according to feedback, because in the first guess it was at position 2 and we got '-', meaning correct letter but wrong position). 
     So we can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the secret word might have R at 2? Actually, no: because if the secret word had R at 2, then when we guessed R at 2, it would be a check (✓). 
     Since we got a minus, that means the secret word has an R at position 1,3,4, or 5? So let's avoid position 2.

   Similarly, E must not be at position 5? Actually, we got a minus for E at position 5? So in the secret word, E is at 1,2,3, or 4? So we avoid E at position 5.

 Also, we are avoiding the letters C, A, N.

 So, back to ""PERKY"": 
   P E R K Y -> positions: 
     1: P (new)
     2: E (now in second position -> we don't know if that's good? We can try)
     3: R (new position and not 2 -> good)
     4: K (new)
     5: Y (new)

 But is ""perky"" a valid word? Yes.

 However, let me consider if there's a better word.

 Another word: ""DRIVE"" -> 
   D R I V E
   R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we know R is not in position 2? So we must avoid putting R at 2.

 So ""DRIVE"" has R at 2 -> invalid for our purpose.

 Another: ""CRIER"" -> but C is not allowed? We avoid C.

 How about ""REMIT"": 
   R E M I T
   positions: R(1), E(2), M(3), I(4), T(5)
   E is at 2? Okay. R at 1? Okay. 
   But note: E is at position 2? We don't know if that's the right position? We might get a check or minus.

   Also, recall that we must avoid E at 5? Here E is at 2? So that's okay.

   But wait: what if E is in the secret word at a position other than 5? It might be at 2? We might get a check? Or if not, then minus.

   Let me see: the word ""REMIT"" seems valid? 

   But note: we have R at position 1? And we don't have any information about position 1? 

   However, we must avoid R at position 2? That's satisfied.

 Another: ""PRICE"" -> but P R I C E: C is not allowed? So invalid.

 Another: ""BRIDE"" -> B R I D E: R is at position 2? -> invalid because we must avoid R at 2.

 How about ""OWLER""? Not very common. 

 I think ""REMIT"" is a good candidate? But let's check common letters: R and E are already known, and we introduce M, I, T.

 Also, we can try ""TREND"": 
   T R E N D -> but N is forbidden? Because in first guess N was marked not present.

 Since we are avoiding N, we can't use ""TREND"".

 Another: ""PEDAL"" -> but A is forbidden? Because A was marked absent in the first guess.

 So, going back to ""PERKY"" and ""REMIT"", both are valid? 

 But note: ""PERKY"" has E at position 2, which we don't know about. Same for ""REMIT"" (R at 1, E at 2).

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts E at position other than 2 and 5? Like position 1, 3, or 4.

 Consider ""HELPS""? Not a 5-letter word? ""HELPS"" is only 5 letters? But H E L P S: E at 2? Still at 2? 

 How about ""EARTH"" -> avoid: E and A? A is forbidden.

 How about ""STERN"": 
   S T E R N -> forbidden N? So no.

 ""BIRSE"": meaning? It's a word? Let me avoid rare words.

 How about ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we avoid R in position 2.

 How about ""QUERY"": Q U E R Y -> E at 3? That's good. R at 4? Also good? Positions: 
   position1: Q -> uncommon? Maybe not the best.
   But we avoid R in 2? Yes, R is at 4? Good.
   E at 3: avoids position 5? Good.

 However, Q is uncommon and we might not cover common letters.

 Another: ""MERRY"" -> duplicate R? We try to avoid duplicates? Also, E at 2? 

 Let me think of ""GOURD"": doesn't have E? But we must include E.

 How about ""VERSE"": duplicate E? Also V E R S E -> E at position 2 and 5? But we cannot have E at 5? So if we have E in position 2 and 5, we avoid E at 5? Actually, the rule says: each letter independently? 
 But let's check: if we guess two E's, and the secret word has one E? Then one E might get a check (if in correct position) and the other might be absent? But the feedback rules: 

 ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols""

 And the example didn't cover duplicates? 

 However, to avoid complexity, I'll try a word without duplicates.

 So, consider ""ROGUE"": 
   R O G U E -> R at 1, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden? So invalid.

 Consider ""OILER"": 
   O I L E R -> E at 4? And R at 5? 
   Positions: 
      1: O
      2: I
      3: L
      4: E
      5: R -> but R is at the fifth? And we avoid R at 2? But fifth is okay? And E at 4? We avoid E at 5? Yes.

 So ""OILER"" is an option? But we don't know if that's common? And we skip some common letters? 

 Another: ""BRINE"": but N is forbidden? 

 We can also try ""HOMER"": 
   H O M E R -> E at 4? R at 5? 
   It includes E and R? And avoids forbidden letters? Yes.

 But note: O and M are new?

 However, let me compare: I want to test letters that are likely to be in the word? 

 We know: the word must have R and E? And avoid C, A, N. 

 Possible vowels: only E? or also others? Might be O, I, U? 

 Among the common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.

 Perhaps we can prioritize those?

 After reconsidering, I think ""STARE"" would have been a classic start? But we already started with ""CRANE"", so we have to adapt.

 How about ""STOLE"": 
   S T O L E -> E at 5 -> avoid E at 5? So invalid.

 ""STILE"": 
   S T I L E -> E at 5 -> avoid.

 Then ""STORE"" is invalid? 

 How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.

 Then ""SETTLE"" is 6 letters? 

 How about ""SPIRE"": 
   S P I R E -> positions: 
     1: S
     2: P
     3: I
     4: R -> R at position 4? (avoided position 2? yes)
     5: E -> avoid? because E cannot be at 5? So invalid.

 Then ""SPREE"": duplicate E? Also E at 5? 

 Let me try ""SPRUE"": not common.

 Given this, I am considering ""REMIT"" again? 

 Or ""PERCH"": but C is forbidden? 

 After some thought, I find ""RESTY"": 
   R E S T Y -> positions: 
     1: R -> R at position 1? (avoided position 2? yes)
     2: E -> E at 2? 
     3: S -> new
     4: T -> new
     5: Y -> new

 But note: E at 2? We don't know? And also, we are avoiding E at 5? But here E is at 2? So that's okay? But we need to avoid R at 2? Not violated.

 However, in the secret word E cannot be at 5? But we put E at 2? That's acceptable.

 But wait: what about the R? We are placing R at 1? We know from the previous feedback that R is in the word? But we don't know the position? So maybe if we put R at 1 we get a check? That would help.

 Similarly, if we get a minus for E at position 2, then we know E is not at 2? 

 Also, we cover S and T? which are common.

 So ""RESTY"" is a valid word? Yes? Meaning: given to rest? 

 But if not, how about ""RESET""? 
   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4? duplicate E? We avoid duplicates? 

 Let me avoid duplicates? And ""RESTY"" is a word.

 Alternative: ""TRUER"": duplicate R? 

 Or ""ROBES"": 
   R O B E S -> E at 4? So avoid E at 5? Okay? But R at 1, E at 4? 
   But S is also common? However, duplicate S? No? ROBES: positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5) -> all distinct.

 But E at 4? Okay.

 Also, we introduce O, B, S.

 After comparing: 
   ""RESTY"" = R E S T Y, distinct letters? Yes.

   ""ROBES"" = R O B E S, distinct.

 Both are good? 

 Also, ""TOWER"": 
   T O W E R -> E at 4? But R at 5? And R is repeated? Actually: T, O, W, E, R -> distinct? Yes? 
   But E at 4, R at 5? 

 Now, we have to decide:

 We want to maximize information? 

 In ""RESTY"", we have R and E? And test S, T, Y? 

 In ""ROBES"", we test O, B, S? 

 We already eliminated A, N? So perhaps both are equivalent? But Y is less common? So maybe ""ROBES"" is better? 

 Another: ""HOUSE"": 
   H O U S E -> E at 5 -> avoid.

 How about ""HORDE"": 
   H O R D E -> R at 3? E at 5 -> avoid E at 5.

 Difficult.

 After rethinking, I think I'll go with ""ROBES"" because it covers O and S? and avoids the fifth position for E.

 So guess: ""ROBES""

 But let me confirm: 
   Positions: 
     position1: R -> we are testing if R is at 1? 
     position2: O -> new
     position3: B -> new
     position4: E -> we are testing if E is at 4? 
     position5: S -> new

 And we avoid R at 2? Yes? O and B could be new letters? 

 However, an alternative word: ""SERUM"" -> 
   S E R U M -> 
     S at 1
     E at 2 -> test E at 2?
     R at 3 -> avoid R position 2? Yes? 
     U at 4? 
     M at 5?

 That is also a possibility? 

 But we have E at 2? and R at 3? 

 Comparing: 
   ""SERUM"": S, E, R, U, M
   ""ROBES"": R, O, B, E, S

 We already know the word has R and E? so both use that? 

 Then which letters do we want to cover? S is common? O is common? 
   SERUM uses U and M? ROBES uses O, B, S? 

 S is more common than M? So ""SERUM"" might be better? 

 But ""SERUM"" puts E at 2? In the first guess E was at 5? and now E at 2? 

 Also, note: in the secret word, E might be at 2? then we get a check? 

 However, we are free to test E at 2? 

 Ultimately, I'll choose ""SERUM""? 

 But let me see the letters: 
   By using ""SERUM"" we test: 
        S at 1 -> will it be check? 
        E at 2 -> 
        R at 3 -> note: we know R is not at 2? but R at 3 is new?
        U at 4? 
        M at 5?

 Then we can get information on S, E, R, U, M? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has the E in a position that we haven't guessed? For example, we had E at 5? Now we want to avoid E at 5? Also avoid E at 2? 

 How about position 1? 

 Consider ""ELVIS""? Not a word? 
 ""EARNS"" -> A forbidden? 
 ""EDGES"" -> duplicate E? 
 ""EGRET"" -> duplicate E? 

 How about ""ETHER""? 
   E T H E R -> duplicate E? 

 How about ""ENROL""? -> uses N? forbidden.

 Then I think it's difficult to avoid E at 2? 

 Actually, we know E is not at 5? And we don't have any information about other positions? So we can put E at any position except 5? 

 We have also to consider: if we put E at 1, then we test a new position? 

 Consider ""ENTRY"" -> N forbidden? 

 How about ""EMPTY"": 
   E M P T Y -> positions: 
     E at 1? Okay? M at 2? P at 3? T at 4? Y at 5? 
   But then we avoid R? Wait, we know the secret word has R? So we must include R? 

 Therefore, we cannot skip R? So the word must contain R? 

 Therefore, the word ""EMPTY"" doesn't contain R -> invalid because we know the secret word has R? 

 So the guess must include R and also E? 

 Therefore, for our second guess we must have R and E? and avoid C, A, N? 

 Conclusion: 
   We choose between ""ROBES"" and ""SERUM""? 

 After careful consideration, I'll choose ""SERUM"" because we have R at a position that we haven't tried (position 3) and we cover S, U, M? 

 Also, note that in ""SERUM"": 
   We avoid placing R at position 2 (it's at 3) and E at position 5? 

 So let's go with ""SERUM"". 

 I hope it's a valid word? Yes? 

 Another common word: ""PRIME""? 
   P R I M E -> but R at position 2 -> avoid? So we must avoid R at position 2? So ""PRIME"" has R at 2 -> invalid.

 Final decision: ""SERUM""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (symbol: x).
- R is in the word but **not** in position 2 (symbol: -).
- E is in the word but **not** in position 5 (symbol: -).

For the second guess:
- Must include R and E (as they are in the secret word).
- Must **avoid** C, A, and N.
- R cannot be placed in position 2.
- E cannot be placed in position 5.
- Prioritize covering new common consonants (e.g., S, T, M) and avoiding duplicates for clarity.

After considering words like ""ROBES"" and ""PERKY"", the word **""SERUM""** fits best:
- Places R in position 3 (new position, avoids position 2).
- Places E in position 2 (a position not yet tested).
- Introduces new letters: S, U, M (no C, A, or N).
- S at position 1, E at position 2, R at position 3, U at position 4, M at position 5—all distinct letters.

This guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while maximizing coverage of common letters.

<guess>serum</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: serum -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given:
 Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
 Guess 2: ""serum"" -> S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)

 Interpretation of feedback:

 From guess 1:
   - R is in the word, not at position 2.
   - E is in the word, not at position 5.
   - C, A, N are not in the word.

 From guess 2:
   - S(x): S is not in the word.
   - E(-): E is in the word but not at position 2 (because we guessed E at position 2 and got '-', meaning it's present but not here).
   - R(-): R is in the word but not at position 3 (because we guessed R at position 3 and got '-').
   - U(x): U is not in the word.
   - M(x): M is not in the word.

 Therefore, we now know:
   - The secret word contains R and E (from both guesses), but not at the positions we've tried so far.
   - We know the secret word does NOT contain: C, A, N, S, U, M (from the x's).

 Also, positions of R and E that have been tried and are incorrect:
   - R was tried at position 2 (from ""crane"") and position 3 (from ""serum"") -> both are incorrect. So R must be at position 1, 4, or 5? Because in a 5-letter word the positions are 1 to 5.
   - E at position 5 (from ""crane"") and position 2 (from ""serum"") -> both are incorrect. So E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.

 Additionally, we have exclusions for letters: C, A, N, S, U, M.

 The word must have exactly 5 letters, including R and E, and three others that are not in the exclusions.

 We need to form a guess that:
   - Uses only letters not excluded: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and of course R and E).
   - Places R only at positions 1, 4, or 5? Because we tried 2 and 3? And similarly E at 1, 3, 4? (avoiding 2 and 5).

 Since the secret word must contain both R and E, and we have two letters known, we have three positions left? But the word can have other repeated letters? However, we haven't encountered duplicates yet? But the feedback doesn't forbid it? So the word might have duplicate letters? But let us proceed without assuming duplicates? We can try a word with distinct letters to avoid confusion? 

 However, in this case, we have only R and E known? But the secret word might have other letters? 

 We need to cover more common letters? 

 Specifically, we can try to include common consonants: T, L, etc.

 But note: we cannot place E at position 2 or 5? And R at position 2 or 3? So for our next guess, we must choose positions for R and E from the allowed ones? And introduce three new letters?

 How about:

   Place R at position 1? Then E at position 3 or 4? 

   Or R at position 4? Then E at position 1 or 3?

   Or R at position 5? Then E at position 1 or 3 or 4?

 Example word: if R at position 1, E at position 3? Then we can have: R ? E ? ?

 We have to fill the blanks? 

 Possibilities:

   Position 1: R
   Position 3: E

 Then we need letters for positions 2,4,5? 

 Position 2: must be a letter not excluded? And we don't know if it's E? But E cannot be at position 2? Because E(-) at position 2 in the second guess? So E is not at 2? Therefore, we use a different letter? 

 Similarly, let's form a word:

   R, [letter2], E, [letter4], [letter5]

 Example: ""RIPER""? 
   But duplicates? E might appear twice? We don't want duplicates? Also, ""I"", ""P"", ""E"", ""R"" -> but E at position 5? Avoid E at 5? Because from first guess we know E is not at 5? So ""RIPER"" has E at 5? -> invalid?

 How about ""RIVET""? 
   R:I:V:E:T -> positions: 
     1: R
     2: I
     3: V? wait: no, we want E at 3? 
   Actually, positions: 
     1: R -> allowed
     2: I -> must not be E? okay, because E not at 2? 
     3: E -> allowed? (since E can be at 3? because we tried E only at 2 and 5)
     4: E? ... wait: ""RIVET"" has letters: R, I, V, E, T -> which positions?
         R (1), I (2), V (3), E (4), T (5) -> then E is at position 4? which is allowed? 
   How about E at 4? That is allowed? 

   But wait: we want E at 4? That works? 

   So ""RIVET"": 
        R(1), I(2), V(3), E(4), T(5)

   This avoids:
        R at 2 and 3? Here R is at 1 -> not tried for R? (we tried position 2 and 3? but not 1) 
        E at 5? Avoided? We have E at 4 -> okay? 
        E at 2? Avoided.

   Also, introduces I, V, T? 

   But note: E is at 4? and R at 1? 

   Another: ""RILED"": 
        R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5) -> same pattern? E at 4.

   Another: ""RIDER"" -> duplicate R? 

   But note: the word must not have excluded letters? So ""RIVET"" is acceptable? 

   However, we have T at 5? That is okay? 

   But we don't know about E at 4? 

 Alternatively, if R is at position 4? Then we can have: 
   ... 
   For example: _ _ _ R _? 
   And we know E must be at 1? or 3? because E can be at 1,3,4? But if R is at 4? then E cannot be at 4? So E at 1 or 3? 

   Example: ""BOXER"" -> excludes: letter B? not excluded? but we haven't eliminated B? 
        B O X E R -> 
          B(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), R(5) -> 
          R at 5: we haven't tried? 
          E at 4: we haven't tried? 
        But note: in ""BOXER"", E is at 4? and R at 5? which are allowed? 
        And we avoid E at 5? 
        And avoid R at 2 and 3? 

        Also, positions: 
          4: E? -> but wait: we have E at 4? which is a new position? 
          5: R -> new.

        The word contains E and R? 
        And letters B, O, X? 

        However, X is uncommon? 

   Also, we have E at 4? which is the same as ""RIVET""? 

   But note: we need to choose a word that maximizes new letters? and common letters? 

   Let's compare: 
        ""RIVET"": letters R, I, V, E, T -> testing I, V, T? 
        ""BOXER"": letters B, O, X, E, R -> testing B, O, X? 

   We might prefer T because it is common? 

   Also, we can consider words that put E at positions 1 or 3? 

   For example: 
        E at 1? 
        Then we can have: E ? ? ? ? 
        Also, R must be at 4 or 5? 

        Example: ""ELDER"" -> 
           E(1), L(2), D(3), E(4)? -> wait, E at 1 and 4? duplicate? 
           Also, R at 5? So ""ELDER"" = E(1) L(2) D(3) E(4) [but actually it should be E(1), L(2), D(3), E(4), R(5)]? Wait, ""ELDER"" does not end with R? 

        ""ELDER"" is E L D E R? -> E at 1 and 4? R at 5? So we have E at 1? But also E at 4? 

        However, we know E is in the word? but we don't know if it is repeated? So we must avoid duplicates? Because if the word has only one E? then we might get confusing feedback? 

        So it's risky? 

   Therefore, to keep distinct letters? We can choose a word without duplicates? 

   So let us avoid duplicates? 

   Possibility: E at 1? 
      Then: E, [letter2], [letter3], [letter4], [letter5]? 
      Letter2: must be a consonant? and not excluded? 
      Letter3: R? Not possible because R is not allowed at position 3? We tried R at 3 and it was wrong? So R cannot be at 3? Therefore, R must be at 4 or 5? 

      Example: ""EATER"" -> duplicates? 
      ""ETHER"" -> duplicates?

   How about ""EERIE""? duplicates.

   Example without duplicate: ""EQUAL"" -> E Q U A L -> but U excluded? and A excluded? 

   ""ETHYL"": E T H Y L -> 
        positions: E(1), T(2), H(3), Y(4), L(5) -> does not have R! -> invalid? because must have R? 

   Therefore, any guess must include R? So we can't skip R? 

   Then for E at position 1? the word must have R at 4 or 5? 

   Example: ""ENTRY"" -> N excluded? 
   ""ERROR"" -> duplicate R? 

   So it's really hard? 

   Alternatively, E at position 3? 

      Pattern: ? ? E ? ? 
      But then R must be at 1,4, or 5? 

      Example: ""STEER"" -> S excluded? Avoid S? 
      ""CREEP"" -> C excluded? 
      ""GREET"" -> G? 
         G R E E T -> duplicate E? 
      ""TREND"" -> N excluded? 

   How about ""PROWL""? doesn't have E? 

   Therefore, E at 4? might be a good choice? 

   Similarly, R at 1? Since it's a common way to start? 

   So going back to: 
        R ? E ? ? -> but then position 3: E? 

        Example: ""RIVER"" -> duplicate R? 
        ""RIPEN"" -> N excluded? 
        ""RIPED"" -> what word? 

   Therefore, perhaps R at 1 and E at 4? 

        Pattern: R ? ? E ? 

        Example: ""ROGUE"": 
          R(1), O(2), G(3), U(4)? -> U excluded? 
        ""ROLEE"" -> duplicate E? 
        ""ROATE""? -> not valid?

        How about ""ROBED"": 
          R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? 
          Avoid exclusions? 
          O? Allowed? Because we haven't excluded O? 
          B? Allowed? 
          D? Allowed? 
          E? at position 4? which is allowed? 

          But note: we tried O? In the second guess? We had ""serum"" and none of the letters were O? So O not excluded? 

          Also, in ""ROBED"": 
             R at 1 -> not tried at 1 before? 
             O at 2 -> new?
             B at 3 -> new?
             E at 4 -> not tried before? 
             D at 5 -> new? 

          But note: we tried E at 2 and 5? Avoided? 
          We tried R at 2 and 3? Avoided? So R at 1? and E at 4? are both new? 

        So ""ROBED"" is a valid word? 

        But let me check: ""ROBED"" means past tense of rob? It's a verb? 

        Alternatively: ""RIDES"" -> 
          R I D E S -> positions: 
            R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), S(5) -> but S excluded? 

          So we must avoid S? 

        Then ""RIFLE"": 
          R(1), I(2), F(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5? Avoided? Because we know E not at 5? 

        ""RIFLE"" is invalid? 

        How about ""RIDGE"": 
          R I D G E -> 
            R(1), I(2), D(3), G(4), E(5) -> E at 5? invalid.

        ""RIPLE"" -> not common? 

        Therefore, ""ROBED"" seems a good option? 
        Alternatively, ""RIPED""? Not a word? 
        Another: ""ROTED""? Not common? 
        ""ROWED"": 
          R O W E D -> 
            R(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), D(5)

        Valid word? meaning ""propel"" a boat? 

        Also, avoids E at 5? 

        But note: we are testing O? which might be a vowel? 

   But wait: in our pattern, we have E at 4? 
   Also, note that we haven't guessed R at 1? So this guess will tell us if R is at position 1? 

   Similarly, we can test if there are T? 

   Given that we haven't tested T? which is common? 

   How about: 
        R at 1? then E at 4? 
        And we want to test T? 

        Example: ""RATED"": 
          R A T E D -> A excluded? 
        ""RITES"": 
          R I T E S -> S excluded? 
        ""RITES"" is invalid because S? 

        How about ""RITEW""? Not a word? 
        ""ROTE"" -> too short? 

        ""RUTED"" -> U excluded? 

        ""ROTEE"" -> duplicate E? 

        Actually, ""R"" at 1, then two letters? then E at 4? and last letter? 
        Example: ""ROTHE""? Not a word? 

        How about ""ROUTE"": 
          R O U T E -> U excluded? 

        Therefore, perhaps ""ROBED"" and ""ROWED"" are acceptable? But note: we haven't used T? 

   Alternatively, we can put R at position 4? And E at position 3? Then: ...? 

      Pattern: ? ? E? R ? ...? 

      Example: ""OFFER"" -> duplicate F? 
          O F E R ? ...? 
          But O at 1? F at 2? E at 3? R at 4? then fifth letter? e.g., ""OFFER"" has five: O F F E R? 
          But duplicate F? and F at 2 and 3? 

      How about ""PILER"" -> 
          P I L E R -> 
            P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), R(5) -> 
            Then R at 5? which is allowed? 
            And E at 4? 

        But wait: E at 4? And the pattern: 
            E: we tried at 2 and 5? Now at 4? 
            R: at 5? we tried R at 2 and 3? but not 5? 

        So ""PILER"" = P I L E R? 
        Valid? meaning one who piles? 

        And letters: P, I, L? We haven't excluded these? 

        Also, introducing L? common? 

   Then ""PILER"" vs ""ROBED"" vs ""ROWED""? 

   We also must consider: we introduced O and B in ""ROBED""? 

   But note: commonality? 

   I think ""ROBED"", ""ROWED"", and ""PILER"" are all acceptable? 

   However, let me think: 
        We know E is not at positions 2 and 5? So only 1,3,4? 
        We know R not at 2 and 3? So only 1,4,5? 

   Now, if in the word ""PILER"":
        E at 4? R at 5?
        So if R is at 5? and E at 4? 

        If the secret word has E at 4? and R at 5? then we would get checks? 

        Also, we can get minuses on P, I, L? 

   Similarly, in ""ROBED"":
        R at 1: if R is at 1? then check? 
        E at 4: if E is at 4? then check? 
        And then we know exactly two positions? 

   So ""ROBED"" has the advantage that we are testing R at a new position (1) and E at a new position (4)? 

   And if they are correct? we win? 

   But note: the secret word might be ""ROBED"" itself? 

   And in ""ROWED"", similarly? R at 1? O at 2? W at 3? E at 4? D at 5? 

   So we can choose ""ROBED""? 

   But note: in the second guess we already used M? which is excluded? So M is out? But ""ROBED"" doesn't have M? 

   So final guess: ""ROBED""

   Reason: 
      - Includes R and E? 
      - Positions: R at 1 (new), E at 4 (new) -> both allowed? 
      - Introduces new letters: O, B, D? 
      - Avoids excluded letters? 
      - Distinct letters? 

   We might get lucky? 

   But there is another possibility: E at 1? 
      Example: ""E? ? R?""? 

      Specifically, E at 1? R at 5? 
        Pattern: E ? ? ? R 

      Example: ""EAGER"" -> A excluded? 
      ""ENTER"" -> N excluded? 
      ""ELDER"" -> L? E? D? E? R? -> duplicate E? 
      ""EMBER"" -> B? 
           E(1), M(2) -> but M excluded? 
      ""EXFER"" -> not a word? 

      Also, E at 1? R at 4? 
        E ? ? R ? 

        ""ELTAR""? Not a word? 
        ""EDGER"" -> G? and D? 
           E(1), D(2), G(3), E(4)? duplicate? 
        ""ERROR"" -> duplicate R? 

      So it's hard? 

   Therefore, I go with ""ROBED"". 

   If not ""ROBED"", maybe ""TREND""? but N excluded? 

   Another: ""GRUEL"" -> G R U E L? U excluded? 

   Therefore, ""ROBED"" seems a solid choice?Based on the feedback from both guesses:

1. **Feedback from ""crane"" (Guess 1):**  
   - R is in the word, but not at position 2.  
   - E is in the word, but not at position 5.  
   - C, A, and N are absent.

2. **Feedback from ""serum"" (Guess 2):**  
   - E is not at position 2.  
   - R is not at position 3.  
   - S, U, and M are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed Letters:** R and E are in the word.  
- **Excluded Letters:** C, A, N, S, U, M.  
- **Constraints:**  
  - R cannot be at positions 2 or 3 (tried and failed).  
  - E cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (tried and failed).  
  - R must be at 1, 4, or 5.  
  - E must be at 1, 3, or 4.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Prioritize placing R and E in new, untested positions (e.g., R at 1 or 4; E at 3 or 4).  
- Introduce common letters not excluded (e.g., B, D, O, T) for maximum coverage.  
- Avoid duplicates for clarity.  

The word **""ROBED""** fits perfectly:
- R (position 1): Untested position; avoids 2 and 3.  
- E (position 4): Untested position; avoids 2 and 5.  
- O, B, D: New, common letters not excluded.  
- All letters distinct → clearer feedback.  

This guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while covering additional high-frequency consonants.

<guess>robed</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: serum -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)
Guess 3: robed -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the third guess ""robed"":
  R(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) D(x)

Interpretation:
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got '-' for R at position 1).
- O is not in the word (x).
- B is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) (✓).
- D is not in the word (x).

So now we know:
- The secret word has E at position 4 (because we got a check for E at position 4).
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (and we already knew it's not at 2 or 3 from previous guesses). Therefore, R must be at position 5 (since positions 1,2,3 are tried and failed, and position 4 is taken by E? So the only position left is 5?).
  - Positions: 1: R (tried and got '-') -> not position 1.
  - From guess1: R at position 2 -> not position 2.
  - From guess2: R at position 3 -> not position 3.
  - Position 4 is now occupied by E (and we have a check, so it's fixed). So R cannot be at 4? 
  - Therefore, R must be at position 5.

- Also, we have new exclusions: O, B, D are not in the word. So now the excluded letters are: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D.

- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5? 
  But wait: we haven't tried R at position 5? So we are deducing that R must be at 5? 

  Let me confirm: 
    Positions 1 to 5:
      Position 1: we tried R -> not here and not the only occurrence? But we know R is in the word? and we haven't placed it? 
      We tried R at 1,2,3 -> all wrong. So the only position left is 5? Because position 4 is E? 

  Therefore, the secret word has R at position 5.

- So the secret word pattern: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] E R

- We know letter1, letter2, letter3 are not in the excluded set? And they are not E or R? 

- Excluded letters: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D.

- Available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we must use three of these for positions 1,2,3).

- We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Now, we need to make a guess that fits the pattern: _ _ _ E R

We want to cover common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Common letters that are still available: T, L, I, P, H, G, etc.

We can try a word that has T, L, or other common letters in the first three positions.

Example words ending with ""ER"": 
  - TIGER: T I G E R -> pattern: T at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
    But note: we have the pattern: [1] [2] [3] E R -> so ""TIGER"" fits: T(1), I(2), G(3), E(4), R(5)
    And the letters: T, I, G are not excluded? 
    So we can try ""TIGER"".

  - Other possibilities: 
      ""LIVER"": L I V E R -> but V is available? 
      ""RIVER"": but R is already at 5? and we cannot have R at 1? but we are not putting R at 1? Actually, ""RIVER"" has R at 1 and 5? But we know R is only at 5? and we have E at 4? So ""RIVER"" would be R at 1? which we know is not present? Because we tried R at 1 and got minus? meaning R is not at 1? So ""RIVER"" would have R at 1? which is not allowed? So invalid.

  - ""TIGER"" is a good candidate? 

  - Also, ""PAGER"": P A G E R -> but A is excluded? 
  - ""HOVER"": H O V E R -> O excluded? 
  - ""LOWER"": L O W E R -> O excluded? 
  - ""TAPER"": T A P E R -> A excluded? 
  - ""WIDER"": W I D E R -> D excluded? 
  - ""FILER"": F I L E R -> F, I, L are available? 
  - ""TILER"": T I L E R -> T, I, L available? 
  - ""FIXER"": F I X E R -> F, I, X available? 
  - ""MIXER"": M excluded? 

So among these, ""TIGER"", ""FILER"", ""TILER"", ""FIXER"" are candidates? 

But note: we want to maximize the chance of hitting the correct letters? 

We can also consider: 
  ""TIGER"" tests T, I, G? 
  ""FILER"" tests F, I, L? 
  ""TILER"" tests T, I, L? 

Since T and L are common? 

But we don't know which one is more likely? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tested? 

But note: we have limited guesses left? 

We have 3 guesses left? (since we are on the fourth guess? We started with 6? and we are about to make the fourth? Actually, we made three: 1. crane, 2. serum, 3. robed -> so next is fourth guess? and we have two more after? 

But we want to solve it quickly? 

Given that we know the pattern is _ _ _ E R, and we have E and R fixed? 

We can try ""TIGER"" and see? 

But note: if ""TIGER"" is the word, we win? 

But if not, we get feedback on T, I, G? 

Similarly, ""TILER"" would test T, I, L? 

I think ""TIGER"" is a common word? 

But let me see: we have excluded many letters? 

The secret word must be a 5-letter word ending with ""ER"", with the third letter not being one of the excluded? 

Possible words: 
  We can list: 
    FIXER? 
    TIGER? 
    TILER? 
    FILER? 
    WIPER? (W is available) 
    HIKER? (H, I, K available) 
    LIKER? 
    RACER? A excluded? 
    MAKER? M excluded? 
    BAKER? B excluded? 
    JOKER? O excluded? 
    POKER? O excluded? 
    RULER? U excluded? 
    SIZER? S excluded? 
    TOWER? O excluded? 
    LOWER? O excluded? 
    POWER? O excluded? 
    HOVER? O excluded? 
    COVER? C and O excluded? 
    MOWER? M and O excluded? 
    DICER? D excluded? 
    NICER? N excluded? 
    RICER? R at 1? but we know R is not at 1? 
    So ""RICER"" is invalid? 

  Therefore, the candidate words are from the available letters? 

  We have: 
    F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

  And the pattern: [1][2][3]ER

  So the first three letters must form a valid 3-letter stem? 

  Common stems: 
    TIG, FIL, TIL, FIX, WIP, HIK, LIK, WIS, etc.

  We can try ""TIGER"" as a guess? 

  But note: we have to avoid using excluded letters? 

  So let's go with ""TIGER"". 

  If it's not the word, we get feedback on T, I, G? 

  We can then use that to narrow down? 

  Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters? 

  But T, I, G are common? 

  So I'll guess ""TIGER"". 

  But wait: what if the word is ""TILER""? We don't know? 

  But we have to choose one? 

  We can also consider ""WIPER"": 
    W I P E R -> W, I, P? 

  But T is more common than W? 

  So ""TIGER"" is better? 

  Final decision: ""TIGER""

  If the feedback shows that T, I, G are correct? then we win? 

  If not, we get information? 

  But note: we are confident that E and R are fixed? 

  So the guess is ""TIGER"". 

  Format: <guess>tiger</guess>### Analysis of Feedback from Previous Guesses:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - R is in the word but not at position 2.  
   - E is in the word but not at position 5.  
   - C, A, N are absent.  

2. **Guess 2: ""serum""**  
   - E is in the word but not at position 2.  
   - R is in the word but not at position 3.  
   - S, U, M are absent.  

3. **Guess 3: ""robed""**  
   - E is **correct and in position 4** (✓).  
   - R is in the word but not at position 1.  
   - O, B, D are absent.  

### Key Deductions:
- **E is fixed at position 4** (confirmed by ✓ in ""robed"").  
- **R must be at position 5**:  
  - R cannot be at positions 1 (tried in ""robed""), 2 (tried in ""crane""), or 3 (tried in ""serum"").  
  - Position 4 is occupied by E, leaving position 5 as the only possibility.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D.  
- **Secret word pattern**: `[letter1][letter2][letter3] E R`  
  - Letters 1–3 must be from the remaining pool: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, L, G) in positions 1–3.  
- Prioritize common words ending in ""ER"" (e.g., ""TIGER"", ""FILER"", ""TILER"").  
- ""TIGER"" is optimal:  
  - Tests T (position 1), I (position 2), G (position 3) — all common letters.  
  - Fits the pattern `_ _ _ E R` and avoids excluded letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: serum -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)
Guess 3: robed -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) D(x)
Guess 4: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(-) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""tiger"":
  T(x) I(-) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)

Interpretation:
- T is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but not at position 2 (because we guessed I at position 2 and got '-').
- G is not in the word (x).
- E is correct at position 4 (✓) — we already knew this.
- R is correct at position 5 (✓) — we just confirmed R at position 5.

So now we know:
- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5. So the pattern is: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] E R.
- I is in the word, but not at position 2.
- T and G are not in the word (new exclusions).

Updated exclusions: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D, T, G.

Available letters: F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that I is in the word, so it must be in one of the first three positions. But we know it's not at position 2 (from the feedback of ""tiger""). Therefore, I must be at position 1 or 3.

So the pattern is:
  Position 1: either I or another letter (but if not I, then I must be at position 3)
  Position 2: a letter that is not I (and not excluded)
  Position 3: if position 1 is not I, then it must be I; otherwise, it can be another letter.

But note: the word must contain I, so it must appear in either position 1 or 3.

We can break it into two cases:

Case 1: I at position 1.
  Pattern: I [letter2] [letter3] E R

Case 2: I at position 3.
  Pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I E R

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses the available letters.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words for each case:

Case 1: I at position 1.
  Examples:
    ""I"" + ? + ? + ""ER""
    We need two letters for positions 2 and 3 from the available set (excluding I? but I is at 1, so positions 2 and 3 are different letters).

    Possible words:
      ""INKER"": I N K E R -> but N is excluded? (from guess1: N(x)) -> invalid.
      ""ILLER"": I L L E R -> duplicate L? and L is available? but we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, the feedback rules don't forbid duplicates? But we haven't encountered one? 
        But note: ""ILLER"" is a word? (meaning one who makes ill? not common) 
        Also, we have L at position 2 and 3? 
      ""IMPER"": I M P E R -> M excluded? 
      ""IDLER"": I D L E R -> D excluded? 
      ""INFER"": I N F E R -> N excluded? 
      ""INTER"": I N T E R -> N and T excluded? 
      ""ICIER"": I C I E R -> C excluded and duplicate I? 
      ""PILER"": we thought earlier? but P is available? but pattern: I at 1? then ""PILER"" doesn't fit? 
      How about ""HIVER"": H I V E R -> but I is at position 2? not 1? 
      ""WIPER"": W I P E R -> I at position 2? not 1? 

    Actually, we need I at 1: 
      ""IKLER""? not a word? 
      ""IFLER""? not a word? 
      ""IWLER""? not a word? 

    It's hard? 

    Another: ""IXLER""? not a word? 

    How about ""JIVER""? J I V E R -> I at 2? 
    ""JIVER"" is not I at 1? 

    Let me think: 
      ""INNER"" -> N excluded? 
      ""ILLER"" as above? 
      ""INVER""? not common? 

    Perhaps ""ILLER"" is the only candidate? But duplicate L? 

    But note: we haven't excluded L? So it's possible? 

    However, we are not sure? 

Case 2: I at position 3.
  Pattern: [letter1] [letter2] I E R

  Examples:
    ""DAZIR""? not a word? 
    ""PENIR""? not a word? 
    ""VALID"": V A L I D -> A excluded? 
    ""HELIR""? not a word? 
    ""FELIR""? not a word? 

    More common: 
      ""FLAIR"": F L A I R -> A excluded? 
      ""PRIOR"": P R I O R -> O excluded? 
      ""TRIOR""? not a word? 
      ""FLIER"": F L I E R -> but note: pattern is [1][2]IER? 
          F(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), R(5) -> matches? 
          And F and L are available? 
          So ""FLIER"" is a candidate? 

      ""FLYER"": F L Y E R -> 
          F(1), L(2), Y(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we need I at 3? This has Y at 3? 
          So not? 

      ""PLIER"": P L I E R -> 
          P(1), L(2), I(3), E(4), R(5) -> matches? 
          P and L available? 

      ""JHIER""? not a word? 

      ""WHIZR""? not a word? 

      ""WRIER"": W R I E R -> but R at position 2? and we know R is only at 5? so R cannot be at 2? 
          Also, duplicate R? 

      ""PRIED"": P R I E D -> D excluded? 
      ""FRIED"": F R I E D -> D excluded? 
      ""PLIED"": P L I E D -> D excluded? 

      So without D? 

      ""FLIER"" and ""PLIER"" are candidates? 

      Also, ""LIER"": too short? 
      ""ELIER""? E at 1? but we have E at 4? and we don't know if E can be duplicated? 
          But ""ELIER"" would be E L I E R -> duplicate E? 
          And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

      But note: we have not seen any duplicate in feedback? 

      However, the rules don't say they are forbidden? 

      But to be safe, let's avoid duplicates? 

      So ""FLIER"" and ""PLIER"" are good? 

      Also, ""JIVER"": J I V E R -> I at 2? not 3? 
      ""WIVER""? not a word? 
      ""HIVER"": H I V E R -> I at 2? 

      ""FIXER"": F I X E R -> I at 2? not 3? 

      ""MINER"": M excluded? 

      So the candidates are ""FLIER"" and ""PLIER"". 

Now, we have two cases? 
  Case 1: I at 1 -> candidate ""ILLER"" (with duplicate L) 
  Case 2: I at 3 -> candidates ""FLIER"", ""PLIER""

But note: in case 1, ""ILLER"" is not a common word? and we have duplicate L? 

In case 2, ""FLIER"" and ""PLIER"" are more common? 

But we don't know which case? 

We need a guess that can help distinguish? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? 

But note: we have only two guesses left? (if we are on the fifth guess? we started with 6, so after 4 we have 2 left?).

We can try a word that has I at position 1? and also tests other letters? 

But we don't have many candidates? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't necessarily have I? but we know I is in the word? so we must include I? 

Therefore, we must include I? 

So we have to choose between the patterns? 

But note: we can also try a word that has I at position 3? and tests new letters? 

For example, ""PLIER"" or ""FLIER""? 

But if we choose ""FLIER"", then:
  Pattern: F L I E R
  We test:
    F at 1: if it's present? 
    L at 2: if it's present? 
    I at 3: we know I is in the word? and if we get a check? then we know I is at 3? 
    E and R are fixed? 

If we get feedback:
  If F is absent? then we know F is not in the word? 
  If L is absent? then L is not? 
  If I is at 3? then we get a check? 

But if I is not at 3? then we get a minus? meaning I is at 1? 

So we can get information? 

Similarly, if we choose ""PLIER"", same thing? 

But note: we don't have to use the exact pattern? We can use a word that has I at position 1? to test that case? 

But we don't have a good candidate for I at 1? 

Therefore, I think it's better to test the case for I at 3? because we have common words? 

We can choose ""FLIER"" or ""PLIER""? 

Which one? 
  ""FLIER"" uses F and L? 
  ""PLIER"" uses P and L? 

Both L is common? 

But F and P are of similar frequency? 

We can choose ""FLIER""? 

But note: we have not used F? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried? 

We have tried: 
  crane: C, R, A, N, E
  serum: S, E, R, U, M
  robed: R, O, B, E, D
  tiger: T, I, G, E, R

So we have not tried: F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

So F and L are new? 

Similarly, P and L are new? 

So both are good? 

I'll choose ""FLIER"". 

But wait: the pattern for ""FLIER"" is F L I E R? 
  Position 1: F
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: E (fixed)
  Position 5: R (fixed)

If the secret word is ""FLIER"", we win? 

If not, we get feedback on F, L, I? 

Specifically, if I is at 3? we get a check? and then we know I is at 3? and we can look for other words? 

If I is not at 3? we get a minus? meaning I is at 1? and then we know the pattern is I [letter2] [letter3] E R? 

And we can then guess accordingly? 

So ""FLIER"" is a good guess? 

But note: what if the word is ""PLIER""? Then we would get feedback that F is absent? and L is present? and I at 3? 

But then we can guess ""PLIER"" next? 

So let's go with ""FLIER"". 

But wait: is ""FLIER"" a valid word? Yes? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't fix I at 3? but tests other positions? 

But we have to include I? 

Another idea: we can try a word that has I at position 1? and also tests new letters? 

For example, ""IVIER""? not a word? 

""ICHOR"": I C H O R -> C and O excluded? 

""IDYLR""? not a word? 

""IGLUR""? not a word? 

So I think ""FLIER"" is a better choice? 

Final guess: ""FLIER"" 

But note: the pattern we are guessing is F L I E R? 

We hope that if it's not the word, we get feedback that helps? 

So <guess>flier</guess>### Analysis of Feedback from Previous Guesses:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - R is in the word but not at position 2.  
   - E is in the word but not at position 5.  
   - C, A, N are absent.  

2. **Guess 2: ""serum""**  
   - E is not at position 2.  
   - R is not at position 3.  
   - S, U, M are absent.  

3. **Guess 3: ""robed""**  
   - E is **correct at position 4** (✓).  
   - R is in the word but not at position 1.  
   - O, B, D are absent.  

4. **Guess 4: ""tiger""**  
   - E is **correct at position 4** (✓) — confirmed again.  
   - R is **correct at position 5** (✓) — new confirmation.  
   - I is in the word but not at position 2.  
   - T, G are absent.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Fixed Positions**:  
  - Position 4: E (✓)  
  - Position 5: R (✓)  
- **I is present** but not at position 2 → must be at position 1 or 3.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D, T, G.  
- **Secret word pattern**: `[letter1][letter2][letter3] E R`  
  - Available letters: F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  - I must be in position 1 or 3.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test **I at position 3** (since position 2 is ruled out) and cover new high-frequency letters.  
- **""FLIER""** fits perfectly:  
  - F (position 1): Tests a new common consonant.  
  - L (position 2): Tests a high-frequency consonant.  
  - I (position 3): Tests the critical position for I.  
  - E and R (positions 4–5) are fixed.  
- If I is at position 3, we get confirmation. If not, I must be at position 1 (narrows to words like ""I____ER"").

Includes R and E (because they are present in the secret word).\n 2. Does not include C, A, or N.\n 3. Places R in a position other than the second, and E in a position other than the fifth.\n\n Also, we should try to cover more common letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of words that contain R and E, and avoid C, A, N.\n\n Possible vowels: We have E already, but we might need others (like I, O, U). Since A is out, we can try I or O.\n\n Common consonants besides R: S, T, L, etc.\n\n Example words: \n   ""ROUSE"": contains R, O, U, S, E -> but note the positions: R is first, E is fifth? \n     However, in our feedback, E is already known to not be fifth, so we cannot place E in the fifth position.\n\n Similarly, we must avoid placing R in the second position.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words with R and E, E not at the end, and R not at the second position.\n\n Alternatives:\n   ""RESET"" -> But E is at positions 2 and 4? We don\'t know about multiple letters yet. Also, we might have duplicated letters?\n   However, in the first guess the word had distinct letters, but the secret word might have duplicates.\n\n But note: in the feedback, we got two minuses for R and E, but we don\'t know if the secret word has multiple of these.\n\n Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. But we don\'t know.\n\n Since we are still early, it\'s better to try words without duplicates to get clearer information.\n\n However, let me check the rules: no mention if duplicates are allowed. Actually, Wordle does allow duplicated letters? \n But typically, the secret word can have duplicate letters? Actually, the rules don\'t specify. But since the example didn\'t have duplicates, and in Wordle the secret word may have duplicates, but we must be cautious.\n\n Considering the feedback: if the same letter appears multiple times in the guess, then the feedback for that letter might be counted independently.\n\n However, to keep it simple for now, let\'s try to avoid duplicates.\n\n So, we need a word that:\n   - Contains R and E (and three other letters not in {C, A, N})\n   - R must not be in position 2 (but note: in our guess, position 2 is the second letter? Remember the indexing: guess was ""C R A N E"", so positions: 1: C, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: E).\n   - E must not be in position 5.\n\n And we want to maximize the possibility of covering new common letters.\n\n How about trying the letter O and T? \n\n Consider ""ROUTE"": \n   R is at position 1 -> okay because in the first guess R was at position 2 and now we move it to 1? \n   But note: the feedback only said the secret word has R, so we can try any position except 2? Actually, we only avoid putting R at position 2? \n   What if the secret word has R at position 1? Then we would get a check.\n\n   E is at position 5 -> but we know from feedback that E is not at position 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at position 5.\n\n Therefore, ""ROUTE"" is not acceptable because E is at fifth.\n\n Another idea: ""STORE"" -> \n   positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), R(4), E(5)\n   E at 5 -> invalid.\n\n We must avoid having E at fifth.\n\n How about ""STIRE""? That\'s not a word? \n\n Let me think of words with E in the beginning or middle.\n\n Examples: \n   ""PERKY"": P E R K Y -> R at position 3 (was position 2 in first guess, so avoid that? Actually, we avoid position 2? But position 3 is new). \n   Also, E is at position 2.\n\n Conditions for positions:\n   - R must not be in position 2 (according to feedback, because in the first guess it was at position 2 and we got \'-\', meaning correct letter but wrong position). \n     So we can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: the secret word might have R at 2? Actually, no: because if the secret word had R at 2, then when we guessed R at 2, it would be a check (✓). \n     Since we got a minus, that means the secret word has an R at position 1,3,4, or 5? So let\'s avoid position 2.\n\n   Similarly, E must not be at position 5? Actually, we got a minus for E at position 5? So in the secret word, E is at 1,2,3, or 4? So we avoid E at position 5.\n\n Also, we are avoiding the letters C, A, N.\n\n So, back to ""PERKY"": \n   P E R K Y -> positions: \n     1: P (new)\n     2: E (now in second position -> we don\'t know if that\'s good? We can try)\n     3: R (new position and not 2 -> good)\n     4: K (new)\n     5: Y (new)\n\n But is ""perky"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n However, let me consider if there\'s a better word.\n\n Another word: ""DRIVE"" -> \n   D R I V E\n   R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we know R is not in position 2? So we must avoid putting R at 2.\n\n So ""DRIVE"" has R at 2 -> invalid for our purpose.\n\n Another: ""CRIER"" -> but C is not allowed? We avoid C.\n\n How about ""REMIT"": \n   R E M I T\n   positions: R(1), E(2), M(3), I(4), T(5)\n   E is at 2? Okay. R at 1? Okay. \n   But note: E is at position 2? We don\'t know if that\'s the right position? We might get a check or minus.\n\n   Also, recall that we must avoid E at 5? Here E is at 2? So that\'s okay.\n\n   But wait: what if E is in the secret word at a position other than 5? It might be at 2? We might get a check? Or if not, then minus.\n\n   Let me see: the word ""REMIT"" seems valid? \n\n   But note: we have R at position 1? And we don\'t have any information about position 1? \n\n   However, we must avoid R at position 2? That\'s satisfied.\n\n Another: ""PRICE"" -> but P R I C E: C is not allowed? So invalid.\n\n Another: ""BRIDE"" -> B R I D E: R is at position 2? -> invalid because we must avoid R at 2.\n\n How about ""OWLER""? Not very common. \n\n I think ""REMIT"" is a good candidate? But let\'s check common letters: R and E are already known, and we introduce M, I, T.\n\n Also, we can try ""TREND"": \n   T R E N D -> but N is forbidden? Because in first guess N was marked not present.\n\n Since we are avoiding N, we can\'t use ""TREND"".\n\n Another: ""PEDAL"" -> but A is forbidden? Because A was marked absent in the first guess.\n\n So, going back to ""PERKY"" and ""REMIT"", both are valid? \n\n But note: ""PERKY"" has E at position 2, which we don\'t know about. Same for ""REMIT"" (R at 1, E at 2).\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that puts E at position other than 2 and 5? Like position 1, 3, or 4.\n\n Consider ""HELPS""? Not a 5-letter word? ""HELPS"" is only 5 letters? But H E L P S: E at 2? Still at 2? \n\n How about ""EARTH"" -> avoid: E and A? A is forbidden.\n\n How about ""STERN"": \n   S T E R N -> forbidden N? So no.\n\n ""BIRSE"": meaning? It\'s a word? Let me avoid rare words.\n\n How about ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> R is at position 2 -> avoid! Because we avoid R in position 2.\n\n How about ""QUERY"": Q U E R Y -> E at 3? That\'s good. R at 4? Also good? Positions: \n   position1: Q -> uncommon? Maybe not the best.\n   But we avoid R in 2? Yes, R is at 4? Good.\n   E at 3: avoids position 5? Good.\n\n However, Q is uncommon and we might not cover common letters.\n\n Another: ""MERRY"" -> duplicate R? We try to avoid duplicates? Also, E at 2? \n\n Let me think of ""GOURD"": doesn\'t have E? But we must include E.\n\n How about ""VERSE"": duplicate E? Also V E R S E -> E at position 2 and 5? But we cannot have E at 5? So if we have E in position 2 and 5, we avoid E at 5? Actually, the rule says: each letter independently? \n But let\'s check: if we guess two E\'s, and the secret word has one E? Then one E might get a check (if in correct position) and the other might be absent? But the feedback rules: \n\n ""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols""\n\n And the example didn\'t cover duplicates? \n\n However, to avoid complexity, I\'ll try a word without duplicates.\n\n So, consider ""ROGUE"": \n   R O G U E -> R at 1, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden? So invalid.\n\n Consider ""OILER"": \n   O I L E R -> E at 4? And R at 5? \n   Positions: \n      1: O\n      2: I\n      3: L\n      4: E\n      5: R -> but R is at the fifth? And we avoid R at 2? But fifth is okay? And E at 4? We avoid E at 5? Yes.\n\n So ""OILER"" is an option? But we don\'t know if that\'s common? And we skip some common letters? \n\n Another: ""BRINE"": but N is forbidden? \n\n We can also try ""HOMER"": \n   H O M E R -> E at 4? R at 5? \n   It includes E and R? And avoids forbidden letters? Yes.\n\n But note: O and M are new?\n\n However, let me compare: I want to test letters that are likely to be in the word? \n\n We know: the word must have R and E? And avoid C, A, N. \n\n Possible vowels: only E? or also others? Might be O, I, U? \n\n Among the common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc.\n\n Perhaps we can prioritize those?\n\n After reconsidering, I think ""STARE"" would have been a classic start? But we already started with ""CRANE"", so we have to adapt.\n\n How about ""STOLE"": \n   S T O L E -> E at 5 -> avoid E at 5? So invalid.\n\n ""STILE"": \n   S T I L E -> E at 5 -> avoid.\n\n Then ""STORE"" is invalid? \n\n How about ""STIRE""? Not a word.\n\n Then ""SETTLE"" is 6 letters? \n\n How about ""SPIRE"": \n   S P I R E -> positions: \n     1: S\n     2: P\n     3: I\n     4: R -> R at position 4? (avoided position 2? yes)\n     5: E -> avoid? because E cannot be at 5? So invalid.\n\n Then ""SPREE"": duplicate E? Also E at 5? \n\n Let me try ""SPRUE"": not common.\n\n Given this, I am considering ""REMIT"" again? \n\n Or ""PERCH"": but C is forbidden? \n\n After some thought, I find ""RESTY"": \n   R E S T Y -> positions: \n     1: R -> R at position 1? (avoided position 2? yes)\n     2: E -> E at 2? \n     3: S -> new\n     4: T -> new\n     5: Y -> new\n\n But note: E at 2? We don\'t know? And also, we are avoiding E at 5? But here E is at 2? So that\'s okay? But we need to avoid R at 2? Not violated.\n\n However, in the secret word E cannot be at 5? But we put E at 2? That\'s acceptable.\n\n But wait: what about the R? We are placing R at 1? We know from the previous feedback that R is in the word? But we don\'t know the position? So maybe if we put R at 1 we get a check? That would help.\n\n Similarly, if we get a minus for E at position 2, then we know E is not at 2? \n\n Also, we cover S and T? which are common.\n\n So ""RESTY"" is a valid word? Yes? Meaning: given to rest? \n\n But if not, how about ""RESET""? \n   R at 1, E at 2, S at 3, E at 4? duplicate E? We avoid duplicates? \n\n Let me avoid duplicates? And ""RESTY"" is a word.\n\n Alternative: ""TRUER"": duplicate R? \n\n Or ""ROBES"": \n   R O B E S -> E at 4? So avoid E at 5? Okay? But R at 1, E at 4? \n   But S is also common? However, duplicate S? No? ROBES: positions: R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), S(5) -> all distinct.\n\n But E at 4? Okay.\n\n Also, we introduce O, B, S.\n\n After comparing: \n   ""RESTY"" = R E S T Y, distinct letters? Yes.\n\n   ""ROBES"" = R O B E S, distinct.\n\n Both are good? \n\n Also, ""TOWER"": \n   T O W E R -> E at 4? But R at 5? And R is repeated? Actually: T, O, W, E, R -> distinct? Yes? \n   But E at 4, R at 5? \n\n Now, we have to decide:\n\n We want to maximize information? \n\n In ""RESTY"", we have R and E? And test S, T, Y? \n\n In ""ROBES"", we test O, B, S? \n\n We already eliminated A, N? So perhaps both are equivalent? But Y is less common? So maybe ""ROBES"" is better? \n\n Another: ""HOUSE"": \n   H O U S E -> E at 5 -> avoid.\n\n How about ""HORDE"": \n   H O R D E -> R at 3? E at 5 -> avoid E at 5.\n\n Difficult.\n\n After rethinking, I think I\'ll go with ""ROBES"" because it covers O and S? and avoids the fifth position for E.\n\n So guess: ""ROBES""\n\n But let me confirm: \n   Positions: \n     position1: R -> we are testing if R is at 1? \n     position2: O -> new\n     position3: B -> new\n     position4: E -> we are testing if E is at 4? \n     position5: S -> new\n\n And we avoid R at 2? Yes? O and B could be new letters? \n\n However, an alternative word: ""SERUM"" -> \n   S E R U M -> \n     S at 1\n     E at 2 -> test E at 2?\n     R at 3 -> avoid R position 2? Yes? \n     U at 4? \n     M at 5?\n\n That is also a possibility? \n\n But we have E at 2? and R at 3? \n\n Comparing: \n   ""SERUM"": S, E, R, U, M\n   ""ROBES"": R, O, B, E, S\n\n We already know the word has R and E? so both use that? \n\n Then which letters do we want to cover? S is common? O is common? \n   SERUM uses U and M? ROBES uses O, B, S? \n\n S is more common than M? So ""SERUM"" might be better? \n\n But ""SERUM"" puts E at 2? In the first guess E was at 5? and now E at 2? \n\n Also, note: in the secret word, E might be at 2? then we get a check? \n\n However, we are free to test E at 2? \n\n Ultimately, I\'ll choose ""SERUM""? \n\n But let me see the letters: \n   By using ""SERUM"" we test: \n        S at 1 -> will it be check? \n        E at 2 -> \n        R at 3 -> note: we know R is not at 2? but R at 3 is new?\n        U at 4? \n        M at 5?\n\n Then we can get information on S, E, R, U, M? \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has the E in a position that we haven\'t guessed? For example, we had E at 5? Now we want to avoid E at 5? Also avoid E at 2? \n\n How about position 1? \n\n Consider ""ELVIS""? Not a word? \n ""EARNS"" -> A forbidden? \n ""EDGES"" -> duplicate E? \n ""EGRET"" -> duplicate E? \n\n How about ""ETHER""? \n   E T H E R -> duplicate E? \n\n How about ""ENROL""? -> uses N? forbidden.\n\n Then I think it\'s difficult to avoid E at 2? \n\n Actually, we know E is not at 5? And we don\'t have any information about other positions? So we can put E at any position except 5? \n\n We have also to consider: if we put E at 1, then we test a new position? \n\n Consider ""ENTRY"" -> N forbidden? \n\n How about ""EMPTY"": \n   E M P T Y -> positions: \n     E at 1? Okay? M at 2? P at 3? T at 4? Y at 5? \n   But then we avoid R? Wait, we know the secret word has R? So we must include R? \n\n Therefore, we cannot skip R? So the word must contain R? \n\n Therefore, the word ""EMPTY"" doesn\'t contain R -> invalid because we know the secret word has R? \n\n So the guess must include R and also E? \n\n Therefore, for our second guess we must have R and E? and avoid C, A, N? \n\n Conclusion: \n   We choose between ""ROBES"" and ""SERUM""? \n\n After careful consideration, I\'ll choose ""SERUM"" because we have R at a position that we haven\'t tried (position 3) and we cover S, U, M? \n\n Also, note that in ""SERUM"": \n   We avoid placing R at position 2 (it\'s at 3) and E at position 5? \n\n So let\'s go with ""SERUM"". \n\n I hope it\'s a valid word? Yes? \n\n Another common word: ""PRIME""? \n   P R I M E -> but R at position 2 -> avoid? So we must avoid R at position 2? So ""PRIME"" has R at 2 -> invalid.\n\n Final decision: ""SERUM""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (symbol: x).\n- R is in the word but **not** in position 2 (symbol: -).\n- E is in the word but **not** in position 5 (symbol: -).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include R and E (as they are in the secret word).\n- Must **avoid** C, A, and N.\n- R cannot be placed in position 2.\n- E cannot be placed in position 5.\n- Prioritize covering new common consonants (e.g., S, T, M) and avoiding duplicates for clarity.\n\nAfter considering words like ""ROBES"" and ""PERKY"", the word **""SERUM""** fits best:\n- Places R in position 3 (new position, avoids position 2).\n- Places E in position 2 (a position not yet tested).\n- Introduces new letters: S, U, M (no C, A, or N).\n- S at position 1, E at position 2, R at position 3, U at position 4, M at position 5—all distinct letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while maximizing coverage of common letters.\n\n<guess>serum</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: serum -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given:\n Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n Guess 2: ""serum"" -> S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)\n\n Interpretation of feedback:\n\n From guess 1:\n   - R is in the word, not at position 2.\n   - E is in the word, not at position 5.\n   - C, A, N are not in the word.\n\n From guess 2:\n   - S(x): S is not in the word.\n   - E(-): E is in the word but not at position 2 (because we guessed E at position 2 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not here).\n   - R(-): R is in the word but not at position 3 (because we guessed R at position 3 and got \'-\').\n   - U(x): U is not in the word.\n   - M(x): M is not in the word.\n\n Therefore, we now know:\n   - The secret word contains R and E (from both guesses), but not at the positions we\'ve tried so far.\n   - We know the secret word does NOT contain: C, A, N, S, U, M (from the x\'s).\n\n Also, positions of R and E that have been tried and are incorrect:\n   - R was tried at position 2 (from ""crane"") and position 3 (from ""serum"") -> both are incorrect. So R must be at position 1, 4, or 5? Because in a 5-letter word the positions are 1 to 5.\n   - E at position 5 (from ""crane"") and position 2 (from ""serum"") -> both are incorrect. So E must be at position 1, 3, or 4.\n\n Additionally, we have exclusions for letters: C, A, N, S, U, M.\n\n The word must have exactly 5 letters, including R and E, and three others that are not in the exclusions.\n\n We need to form a guess that:\n   - Uses only letters not excluded: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and of course R and E).\n   - Places R only at positions 1, 4, or 5? Because we tried 2 and 3? And similarly E at 1, 3, 4? (avoiding 2 and 5).\n\n Since the secret word must contain both R and E, and we have two letters known, we have three positions left? But the word can have other repeated letters? However, we haven\'t encountered duplicates yet? But the feedback doesn\'t forbid it? So the word might have duplicate letters? But let us proceed without assuming duplicates? We can try a word with distinct letters to avoid confusion? \n\n However, in this case, we have only R and E known? But the secret word might have other letters? \n\n We need to cover more common letters? \n\n Specifically, we can try to include common consonants: T, L, etc.\n\n But note: we cannot place E at position 2 or 5? And R at position 2 or 3? So for our next guess, we must choose positions for R and E from the allowed ones? And introduce three new letters?\n\n How about:\n\n   Place R at position 1? Then E at position 3 or 4? \n\n   Or R at position 4? Then E at position 1 or 3?\n\n   Or R at position 5? Then E at position 1 or 3 or 4?\n\n Example word: if R at position 1, E at position 3? Then we can have: R ? E ? ?\n\n We have to fill the blanks? \n\n Possibilities:\n\n   Position 1: R\n   Position 3: E\n\n Then we need letters for positions 2,4,5? \n\n Position 2: must be a letter not excluded? And we don\'t know if it\'s E? But E cannot be at position 2? Because E(-) at position 2 in the second guess? So E is not at 2? Therefore, we use a different letter? \n\n Similarly, let\'s form a word:\n\n   R, [letter2], E, [letter4], [letter5]\n\n Example: ""RIPER""? \n   But duplicates? E might appear twice? We don\'t want duplicates? Also, ""I"", ""P"", ""E"", ""R"" -> but E at position 5? Avoid E at 5? Because from first guess we know E is not at 5? So ""RIPER"" has E at 5? -> invalid?\n\n How about ""RIVET""? \n   R:I:V:E:T -> positions: \n     1: R\n     2: I\n     3: V? wait: no, we want E at 3? \n   Actually, positions: \n     1: R -> allowed\n     2: I -> must not be E? okay, because E not at 2? \n     3: E -> allowed? (since E can be at 3? because we tried E only at 2 and 5)\n     4: E? ... wait: ""RIVET"" has letters: R, I, V, E, T -> which positions?\n         R (1), I (2), V (3), E (4), T (5) -> then E is at position 4? which is allowed? \n   How about E at 4? That is allowed? \n\n   But wait: we want E at 4? That works? \n\n   So ""RIVET"": \n        R(1), I(2), V(3), E(4), T(5)\n\n   This avoids:\n        R at 2 and 3? Here R is at 1 -> not tried for R? (we tried position 2 and 3? but not 1) \n        E at 5? Avoided? We have E at 4 -> okay? \n        E at 2? Avoided.\n\n   Also, introduces I, V, T? \n\n   But note: E is at 4? and R at 1? \n\n   Another: ""RILED"": \n        R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5) -> same pattern? E at 4.\n\n   Another: ""RIDER"" -> duplicate R? \n\n   But note: the word must not have excluded letters? So ""RIVET"" is acceptable? \n\n   However, we have T at 5? That is okay? \n\n   But we don\'t know about E at 4? \n\n Alternatively, if R is at position 4? Then we can have: \n   ... \n   For example: _ _ _ R _? \n   And we know E must be at 1? or 3? because E can be at 1,3,4? But if R is at 4? then E cannot be at 4? So E at 1 or 3? \n\n   Example: ""BOXER"" -> excludes: letter B? not excluded? but we haven\'t eliminated B? \n        B O X E R -> \n          B(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), R(5) -> \n          R at 5: we haven\'t tried? \n          E at 4: we haven\'t tried? \n        But note: in ""BOXER"", E is at 4? and R at 5? which are allowed? \n        And we avoid E at 5? \n        And avoid R at 2 and 3? \n\n        Also, positions: \n          4: E? -> but wait: we have E at 4? which is a new position? \n          5: R -> new.\n\n        The word contains E and R? \n        And letters B, O, X? \n\n        However, X is uncommon? \n\n   Also, we have E at 4? which is the same as ""RIVET""? \n\n   But note: we need to choose a word that maximizes new letters? and common letters? \n\n   Let\'s compare: \n        ""RIVET"": letters R, I, V, E, T -> testing I, V, T? \n        ""BOXER"": letters B, O, X, E, R -> testing B, O, X? \n\n   We might prefer T because it is common? \n\n   Also, we can consider words that put E at positions 1 or 3? \n\n   For example: \n        E at 1? \n        Then we can have: E ? ? ? ? \n        Also, R must be at 4 or 5? \n\n        Example: ""ELDER"" -> \n           E(1), L(2), D(3), E(4)? -> wait, E at 1 and 4? duplicate? \n           Also, R at 5? So ""ELDER"" = E(1) L(2) D(3) E(4) [but actually it should be E(1), L(2), D(3), E(4), R(5)]? Wait, ""ELDER"" does not end with R? \n\n        ""ELDER"" is E L D E R? -> E at 1 and 4? R at 5? So we have E at 1? But also E at 4? \n\n        However, we know E is in the word? but we don\'t know if it is repeated? So we must avoid duplicates? Because if the word has only one E? then we might get confusing feedback? \n\n        So it\'s risky? \n\n   Therefore, to keep distinct letters? We can choose a word without duplicates? \n\n   So let us avoid duplicates? \n\n   Possibility: E at 1? \n      Then: E, [letter2], [letter3], [letter4], [letter5]? \n      Letter2: must be a consonant? and not excluded? \n      Letter3: R? Not possible because R is not allowed at position 3? We tried R at 3 and it was wrong? So R cannot be at 3? Therefore, R must be at 4 or 5? \n\n      Example: ""EATER"" -> duplicates? \n      ""ETHER"" -> duplicates?\n\n   How about ""EERIE""? duplicates.\n\n   Example without duplicate: ""EQUAL"" -> E Q U A L -> but U excluded? and A excluded? \n\n   ""ETHYL"": E T H Y L -> \n        positions: E(1), T(2), H(3), Y(4), L(5) -> does not have R! -> invalid? because must have R? \n\n   Therefore, any guess must include R? So we can\'t skip R? \n\n   Then for E at position 1? the word must have R at 4 or 5? \n\n   Example: ""ENTRY"" -> N excluded? \n   ""ERROR"" -> duplicate R? \n\n   So it\'s really hard? \n\n   Alternatively, E at position 3? \n\n      Pattern: ? ? E ? ? \n      But then R must be at 1,4, or 5? \n\n      Example: ""STEER"" -> S excluded? Avoid S? \n      ""CREEP"" -> C excluded? \n      ""GREET"" -> G? \n         G R E E T -> duplicate E? \n      ""TREND"" -> N excluded? \n\n   How about ""PROWL""? doesn\'t have E? \n\n   Therefore, E at 4? might be a good choice? \n\n   Similarly, R at 1? Since it\'s a common way to start? \n\n   So going back to: \n        R ? E ? ? -> but then position 3: E? \n\n        Example: ""RIVER"" -> duplicate R? \n        ""RIPEN"" -> N excluded? \n        ""RIPED"" -> what word? \n\n   Therefore, perhaps R at 1 and E at 4? \n\n        Pattern: R ? ? E ? \n\n        Example: ""ROGUE"": \n          R(1), O(2), G(3), U(4)? -> U excluded? \n        ""ROLEE"" -> duplicate E? \n        ""ROATE""? -> not valid?\n\n        How about ""ROBED"": \n          R(1), O(2), B(3), E(4), D(5)? \n          Avoid exclusions? \n          O? Allowed? Because we haven\'t excluded O? \n          B? Allowed? \n          D? Allowed? \n          E? at position 4? which is allowed? \n\n          But note: we tried O? In the second guess? We had ""serum"" and none of the letters were O? So O not excluded? \n\n          Also, in ""ROBED"": \n             R at 1 -> not tried at 1 before? \n             O at 2 -> new?\n             B at 3 -> new?\n             E at 4 -> not tried before? \n             D at 5 -> new? \n\n          But note: we tried E at 2 and 5? Avoided? \n          We tried R at 2 and 3? Avoided? So R at 1? and E at 4? are both new? \n\n        So ""ROBED"" is a valid word? \n\n        But let me check: ""ROBED"" means past tense of rob? It\'s a verb? \n\n        Alternatively: ""RIDES"" -> \n          R I D E S -> positions: \n            R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), S(5) -> but S excluded? \n\n          So we must avoid S? \n\n        Then ""RIFLE"": \n          R(1), I(2), F(3), L(4), E(5) -> E at 5? Avoided? Because we know E not at 5? \n\n        ""RIFLE"" is invalid? \n\n        How about ""RIDGE"": \n          R I D G E -> \n            R(1), I(2), D(3), G(4), E(5) -> E at 5? invalid.\n\n        ""RIPLE"" -> not common? \n\n        Therefore, ""ROBED"" seems a good option? \n        Alternatively, ""RIPED""? Not a word? \n        Another: ""ROTED""? Not common? \n        ""ROWED"": \n          R O W E D -> \n            R(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), D(5)\n\n        Valid word? meaning ""propel"" a boat? \n\n        Also, avoids E at 5? \n\n        But note: we are testing O? which might be a vowel? \n\n   But wait: in our pattern, we have E at 4? \n   Also, note that we haven\'t guessed R at 1? So this guess will tell us if R is at position 1? \n\n   Similarly, we can test if there are T? \n\n   Given that we haven\'t tested T? which is common? \n\n   How about: \n        R at 1? then E at 4? \n        And we want to test T? \n\n        Example: ""RATED"": \n          R A T E D -> A excluded? \n        ""RITES"": \n          R I T E S -> S excluded? \n        ""RITES"" is invalid because S? \n\n        How about ""RITEW""? Not a word? \n        ""ROTE"" -> too short? \n\n        ""RUTED"" -> U excluded? \n\n        ""ROTEE"" -> duplicate E? \n\n        Actually, ""R"" at 1, then two letters? then E at 4? and last letter? \n        Example: ""ROTHE""? Not a word? \n\n        How about ""ROUTE"": \n          R O U T E -> U excluded? \n\n        Therefore, perhaps ""ROBED"" and ""ROWED"" are acceptable? But note: we haven\'t used T? \n\n   Alternatively, we can put R at position 4? And E at position 3? Then: ...? \n\n      Pattern: ? ? E? R ? ...? \n\n      Example: ""OFFER"" -> duplicate F? \n          O F E R ? ...? \n          But O at 1? F at 2? E at 3? R at 4? then fifth letter? e.g., ""OFFER"" has five: O F F E R? \n          But duplicate F? and F at 2 and 3? \n\n      How about ""PILER"" -> \n          P I L E R -> \n            P(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), R(5) -> \n            Then R at 5? which is allowed? \n            And E at 4? \n\n        But wait: E at 4? And the pattern: \n            E: we tried at 2 and 5? Now at 4? \n            R: at 5? we tried R at 2 and 3? but not 5? \n\n        So ""PILER"" = P I L E R? \n        Valid? meaning one who piles? \n\n        And letters: P, I, L? We haven\'t excluded these? \n\n        Also, introducing L? common? \n\n   Then ""PILER"" vs ""ROBED"" vs ""ROWED""? \n\n   We also must consider: we introduced O and B in ""ROBED""? \n\n   But note: commonality? \n\n   I think ""ROBED"", ""ROWED"", and ""PILER"" are all acceptable? \n\n   However, let me think: \n        We know E is not at positions 2 and 5? So only 1,3,4? \n        We know R not at 2 and 3? So only 1,4,5? \n\n   Now, if in the word ""PILER"":\n        E at 4? R at 5?\n        So if R is at 5? and E at 4? \n\n        If the secret word has E at 4? and R at 5? then we would get checks? \n\n        Also, we can get minuses on P, I, L? \n\n   Similarly, in ""ROBED"":\n        R at 1: if R is at 1? then check? \n        E at 4: if E is at 4? then check? \n        And then we know exactly two positions? \n\n   So ""ROBED"" has the advantage that we are testing R at a new position (1) and E at a new position (4)? \n\n   And if they are correct? we win? \n\n   But note: the secret word might be ""ROBED"" itself? \n\n   And in ""ROWED"", similarly? R at 1? O at 2? W at 3? E at 4? D at 5? \n\n   So we can choose ""ROBED""? \n\n   But note: in the second guess we already used M? which is excluded? So M is out? But ""ROBED"" doesn\'t have M? \n\n   So final guess: ""ROBED""\n\n   Reason: \n      - Includes R and E? \n      - Positions: R at 1 (new), E at 4 (new) -> both allowed? \n      - Introduces new letters: O, B, D? \n      - Avoids excluded letters? \n      - Distinct letters? \n\n   We might get lucky? \n\n   But there is another possibility: E at 1? \n      Example: ""E? ? R?""? \n\n      Specifically, E at 1? R at 5? \n        Pattern: E ? ? ? R \n\n      Example: ""EAGER"" -> A excluded? \n      ""ENTER"" -> N excluded? \n      ""ELDER"" -> L? E? D? E?

U excluded? \n\n   Therefore, ""ROBED"" seems a solid choice?Based on the feedback from both guesses:\n\n1. **Feedback from ""crane"" (Guess 1):**  \n   - R is in the word, but not at position 2.  \n   - E is in the word, but not at position 5.  \n   - C, A, and N are absent.\n\n2. **Feedback from ""serum"" (Guess 2):**  \n   - E is not at position 2.  \n   - R is not at position 3.  \n   - S, U, and M are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed Letters:** R and E are in the word.  \n- **Excluded Letters:** C, A, N, S, U, M.  \n- **Constraints:**  \n  - R cannot be at positions 2 or 3 (tried and failed).  \n  - E cannot be at positions 2 or 5 (tried and failed).  \n  - R must be at 1, 4, or 5.  \n  - E must be at 1, 3, or 4.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Prioritize placing R and E in new, untested positions (e.g., R at 1 or 4; E at 3 or 4).  \n- Introduce common letters not excluded (e.g., B, D, O, T) for maximum coverage.  \n- Avoid duplicates for clarity.  \n\nThe word **""ROBED""** fits perfectly:\n- R (position 1): Untested position; avoids 2 and 3.  \n- E (position 4): Untested position; avoids 2 and 5.  \n- O, B, D: New, common letters not excluded.  \n- All letters distinct → clearer feedback.  \n\nThis guess efficiently tests R and E in new positions while covering additional high-frequency consonants.\n\n<guess>robed</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: serum -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)\nGuess 3: robed -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the feedback for the third guess ""robed"":\n  R(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) D(x)\n\nInterpretation:\n- R is in the word but not at position 1 (since we got \'-\' for R at position 1).\n- O is not in the word (x).\n- B is not in the word (x).\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) (✓).\n- D is not in the word (x).\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has E at position 4 (because we got a check for E at position 4).\n- R is in the word but not at position 1 (and we already knew it\'s not at 2 or 3 from previous guesses). Therefore, R must be at position 5 (since positions 1,2,3 are tried and failed, and position 4 is taken by E? So the only position left is 5?).\n  - Positions: 1: R (tried and got \'-\') -> not position 1.\n  - From guess1: R at position 2 -> not position 2.\n  - From guess2: R at position 3 -> not position 3.\n  - Position 4 is now occupied by E (and we have a check, so it\'s fixed). So R cannot be at 4? \n  - Therefore, R must be at position 5.\n\n- Also, we have new exclusions: O, B, D are not in the word. So now the excluded letters are: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D.\n\n- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5? \n  But wait: we haven\'t tried R at position 5? So we are deducing that R must be at 5? \n\n  Let me confirm: \n    Positions 1 to 5:\n      Position 1: we tried R -> not here and not the only occurrence? But we know R is in the word? and we haven\'t placed it? \n      We tried R at 1,2,3 -> all wrong. So the only position left is 5? Because position 4 is E? \n\n  Therefore, the secret word has R at position 5.\n\n- So the secret word pattern: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] E R\n\n- We know letter1, letter2, letter3 are not in the excluded set? And they are not E or R? \n\n- Excluded letters: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D.\n\n- Available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we must use three of these for positions 1,2,3).\n\n- We also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nNow, we need to make a guess that fits the pattern: _ _ _ E R\n\nWe want to cover common letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\nCommon letters that are still available: T, L, I, P, H, G, etc.\n\nWe can try a word that has T, L, or other common letters in the first three positions.\n\nExample words ending with ""ER"": \n  - TIGER: T I G E R -> pattern: T at 1, I at 2, G at 3, E at 4, R at 5? \n    But note: we have the pattern: [1] [2] [3] E R -> so ""TIGER"" fits: T(1), I(2), G(3), E(4), R(5)\n    And the letters: T, I, G are not excluded? \n    So we can try ""TIGER"".\n\n  - Other possibilities: \n      ""LIVER"": L I V E R -> but V is available? \n      ""RIVER"": but R is already at 5? and we cannot have R at 1? but we are not putting R at 1? Actually, ""RIVER"" has R at 1 and 5? But we know R is only at 5? and we have E at 4? So ""RIVER"" would be R at 1? which we know is not present? Because we tried R at 1 and got minus? meaning R is not at 1? So ""RIVER"" would have R at 1? which is not allowed?

We don\'t know? \n\n  But we have to choose one? \n\n  We can also consider ""WIPER"": \n    W I P E R -> W, I, P? \n\n  But T is more common than W? \n\n  So ""TIGER"" is better? \n\n  Final decision: ""TIGER""\n\n  If the feedback shows that T, I, G are correct? then we win? \n\n  If not, we get information? \n\n  But note: we are confident that E and R are fixed? \n\n  So the guess is ""TIGER"". \n\n  Format: <guess>tiger</guess>### Analysis of Feedback from Previous Guesses:\n\n1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  \n   - R is in the word but not at position 2.  \n   - E is in the word but not at position 5.  \n   - C, A, N are absent.  \n\n2. **Guess 2: ""serum""**  \n   - E is in the word but not at position 2.  \n   - R is in the word but not at position 3.  \n   - S, U, M are absent.  \n\n3. **Guess 3: ""robed""**  \n   - E is **correct and in position 4** (✓).  \n   - R is in the word but not at position 1.  \n   - O, B, D are absent.  \n\n### Key Deductions:\n- **E is fixed at position 4** (confirmed by ✓ in ""robed"").  \n- **R must be at position 5**:  \n  - R cannot be at positions 1 (tried in ""robed""), 2 (tried in ""crane""), or 3 (tried in ""serum"").  \n  - Position 4 is occupied by E, leaving position 5 as the only possibility.  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D.  \n- **Secret word pattern**: `[letter1][letter2][letter3] E R`  \n  - Letters 1–3 must be from the remaining pool: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, L, G) in positions 1–3.  \n- Prioritize common words ending in ""ER"" (e.g., ""TIGER"", ""FILER"", ""TILER"").  \n- ""TIGER"" is optimal:  \n  - Tests T (position 1), I (position 2), G (position 3) — all common letters.  \n  - Fits the pattern `_ _ _ E R` and avoids excluded letters.\n\n<guess>tiger</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: serum -> FEEDBACK: S(x) E(-) R(-) U(x) M(x)\nGuess 3: robed -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) B(x) E(✓) D(x)\nGuess 4: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(-) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""tiger"":\n  T(x) I(-) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n\nInterpretation:\n- T is not in the word (x).\n- I is in the word but not at position 2 (because we guessed I at position 2 and got \'-\').\n- G is not in the word (x).\n- E is correct at position 4 (✓) — we already knew this.\n- R is correct at position 5 (✓) — we just confirmed R at position 5.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5.

We have new feedback from guess 5: ""flier"" -> F(x) L(✓) I(✓) E(✓) R(✓)

This feedback tells us:
- F is not in the word (x).
- L is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 2) (✓).
- I is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 3) (✓).
- E is confirmed correct at position 4 (✓).
- R is confirmed correct at position 5 (✓).

So the secret word now has:
- Position 2: L (fixed)
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)

Therefore, the secret word pattern is: [letter1] L I E R

We only need to determine the first letter.

Excluded letters (from previous feedbacks):
- C (guess1)
- A (guess1)
- N (guess1)
- S (guess2)
- U (guess2)
- M (guess2)
- O (guess3)
- B (guess3)
- D (guess3)
- T (guess4)
- G (guess4)
- F (guess5)

Available letters (not yet tested and not excluded): H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The word must be a valid English word starting with one of these letters, followed by ""LIER"".

Common words ending with ""LIER"":
- ""PLIER"" but P is available? However, we haven't excluded P? But in pattern, it's the first letter? 
  Actually, ""PLIER"" is P L I E R -> but we have fixed L at 2, I at 3, E at 4, R at 5? So the word would be ""PLIER""? 
  But note: in our pattern, the first letter is unknown? And P is available? So ""PLIER"" is a candidate.

Other possibilities:
- ""SLIER"": but S is excluded? 
- ""ALIEN"": A excluded? 
- ""FLIER"": F excluded? 
- ""GLIER"": G excluded? 
- ""OLIER"": O excluded? 
- ""BLIER"": B excluded? 
- ""ETIER"": not a word? 

So ""PLIER"" (P at position 1) is a candidate? 

Additional words:
- ""JLIER""? not a word? 
- ""KLIER"": K L I E R -> Is it a word? Kier may refer to a beam? but ""KLier"" is not common? 
  However, ""KLIER"" as a proper noun? But if we are only using common words? 
- ""HLIER"": not a word? 
- ""QLIER"": not a word? 
- ""VLIER"": not a word? 
- ""WLIER"": not a word? 
- ""XLIER"": not a word? 
- ""YLIER"": not a word? 
- ""ZLIER"": not a word? 

Other words: 
  ""HOVER"": O and V? but pattern not matching? 

So perhaps ""PLIER"" is the only common word? 

But note: there is also ""SLIER"" (comparative of sly) -> but S is excluded? 

Therefore, we can try ""PLIER"". 

If ""PLIER"" is the word? We win? 

If not, then we must try other letters? But we don't know? 

However, let me check if there are other words? 

One more: ""MULTI"": not matching pattern? 

How about ""AXIOM"": pattern doesn't match? 

So for the pattern _LIER, the only common word left is ""PLIER""? 

But note: there is ""BELIE"", but that's 5 letters? but pattern: B E L I E? not matching? 

Therefore, I think the word is ""PLIER"". 

So we guess ""PLIER"". 

But note: the first guess had R? But R is fixed at 5? 

And we have not seen any conflict? 

So let's go with ""PLIER"". 

If not, then we have one last guess? 

But I hope it's correct. 

Therefore, the guess is ""PLIER"".

### Analysis of Feedback from Previous Guesses:

1. **Guess 5: ""flier""**  
   - L is **correct at position 2** (✓).  
   - I is **correct at position 3** (✓).  
   - E and R remain **correct at positions 4 and 5** (✓✓).  
   - F is absent (x).  

### Key Deductions:
- **Fixed Positions**:  
  - Position 2: L (✓)  
  - Position 3: I (✓)  
  - Position 4: E (✓)  
  - Position 5: R (✓)  
- **Secret word pattern**: `[letter1] L I E R`  
  - Only position 1 is unknown.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, S, U, M, O, B, D, T, G, F (all marked ""x"" in prior feedback).  
- **Available letters for position 1**: H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy: 
- Test the most common valid word matching `_LIER`: **""PLIER""** (a tool for bending wire).  
- This uses P (a high-frequency consonant) and fits the pattern while avoiding excluded letters.  
- If correct, all positions will match. If not, the feedback will confirm P’s status (last remaining unknown).
