We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was at position 2 and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E.
   - Contains the letter R (but not in the second position).

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We know the word must have an R. Since R is not in position 2, we can try placing R in a different position.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (since position 2 is wrong).

 We also want to test other common letters.

 Let's consider a word that has R in a different position and includes other common consonants and vowels (but avoiding the excluded letters).

 Since we don't have any vowels from the first guess (A and E are out), we need to try other vowels: I, O, U.

 Let's try to include at least two vowels and the R.

 Example: ""ROUST"" has R, O, U, S, T. But note: R is in the first position. However, we don't know if that's allowed. Also, we haven't tried O, U, S, T.

 But wait: we must avoid the letters that are not in the word (C, A, N, E). So ""ROUST"" is okay.

 However, we have to consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a position we haven't tested, such as position 3 or 4.

 But note: we don't have much information, so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me list some words that fit:
 - ""TRIES"": has T, R, I, E, S -> but E is excluded (from feedback: E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.
 - ""PROUD"": has P, R, O, U, D -> but we haven't tried P, O, U, D. Also, R is in position 2? But wait, in ""crane"" R was in position 2 and we know it's not there. So in ""PROUD"", R is in position 2 again? That would be the same position. We should avoid putting R in position 2 because we know it's not there.

 Therefore, we must avoid position 2 for R.

 So ""PROUD"" is not good because R is in position 2.

 Let me try ""SPRIG"": but S, P, R, I, G. However, R is in position 3? But note: we have 5 letters. ""SPRIG"": S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). So R is in position 3. Also, we avoid A, E, N, C. But we have not tried S, P, I, G.

 However, we must also note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Another idea: ""ROBIN"" -> but N is excluded (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

 How about ""ROILS"": R(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). But we are putting R in position 1 and O in position 2. We don't know about O. However, we are avoiding the excluded letters.

 But note: we are also avoiding A, E, N, C. So ""ROILS"" is acceptable.

 However, we are using O and I (vowels) and L, S (consonants). This seems good.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTS"" but that has duplicate S? And we don't want duplicates necessarily.

 Another common word: ""TRAIL"" -> but T, R, A, I, L. But A is excluded. So we cannot use A.

 How about ""TROIS"": T, R, O, I, S. R is in position 2? We must avoid position 2 for R. In ""TROIS"": T(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), S(5). So R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

 Let me try ""STRIP"": S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). R is in position 3 -> okay. And we avoid the excluded letters.

 So ""STRIP"" is a candidate.

 Another candidate: ""SPRIT"" (if valid) -> but let's stick to common words. ""SPRIT"" is not very common. Instead, ""SPRIG"" as I thought earlier? But ""SPRIG"" is valid.

 However, we want to test more vowels? ""STRIP"" has the vowel I.

 But we haven't tested O or U. Maybe we should try a word with O or U.

 How about ""ROOMY"": but O is repeated and we don't know if O is in the word. Also, we have Y. But let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""ROGUE"" -> but E is excluded. So no.

 ""ROUND"" -> but N is excluded.

 ""ROWDY"": R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5). This avoids the excluded letters. And R is in position 1 (which is not position 2, so allowed). We test O, W, D, Y.

 But we are not testing as many common letters as we could.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 I think ""ROILS"" is a good candidate: R in position 1, and then O, I, L, S.

 But note: we are putting R in position 1. It might be correct? We don't know. But we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can put R in position 3 or 4 to see if it fits there.

 Let me think of a word that has R in position 3: for example, ""BIRCH"" -> but B, I, R, C, H. But C is excluded (from first feedback: C is not in the word). So we cannot use C.

 ""DIRTY"": D, I, R, T, Y. R is in position 3. And we avoid excluded letters. So D, I, R, T, Y.

 But we haven't tried D, I, T, Y. And we know R is in the word.

 Another word: ""FIRST"": F, I, R, S, T. R in position 3. And F, I, S, T are new.

 ""FIRST"" is a good candidate because it has common letters.

 But note: we are also missing vowels. We have I (a vowel) in position 2.

 Let me compare ""FIRST"" and ""STRIP"":
   - ""FIRST"": F(1), I(2), R(3), S(4), T(5)
   - ""STRIP"": S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5)

 Both have R in position 3. But ""STRIP"" uses P and ""FIRST"" uses F. Both are reasonable.

 However, we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know E, A, N are out. So T, O, I, S are good.

 ""STRIP"" has S, T, R, I, P -> that's 5 new letters (except R which we know is in). And we are testing S, T, I, P.

 ""FIRST"" has F, I, R, S, T -> testing F, I, S, T.

 Since F is less common than P? Actually, P is more common than F. But both are acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that includes O. Since we haven't tested O, it might be in the word.

 Let me try to form a word with R and O, and without the excluded letters.

 Example: ""BROOD"" -> duplicate O? and we don't know about B and D.

 ""PROUD"" is not allowed because R is in position 2.

 ""ROBOT"" -> has B, O, T. But R is in position 1. And we avoid excluded letters? Yes, because no C, A, N, E. But we have O and T.

 However, we have duplicate O? And we are not testing many letters.

 Another word: ""ROOST"" -> R(1), O(2), O(3), S(4), T(5). Duplicate O, which is not ideal.

 How about ""ROTIS"" (if valid) -> not common. Instead, ""ROSIT"" is not common.

 I think ""ROILS"" is still a candidate: R(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). We test R, O, I, L, S. And we avoid duplicates.

 But note: we are putting R in position 1. We don't know if that's correct. But we are allowed to try.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ORBIT"": O(1), R(2), B(3), I(4), T(5). But wait, R is in position 2 -> we know that position 2 is wrong for R. So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""ORBIT"" is invalid because it puts R in the wrong position we already know.

 So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, in ""ROILS"", R is in position 1 -> okay.

 Now, let me decide between ""STRIP"", ""FIRST"", and ""ROILS"".

 We want to test the vowel O? We haven't tested O, so it might be in the word. Similarly, we haven't tested I and U.

 Since we have limited vowels (only I, O, U available because A and E are out), we should test at least one of them.

 ""STRIP"" tests I (in position 4) and ""ROILS"" tests O and I.

 So ""ROILS"" tests two vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (L and S). It also tests R in a new position (1).

 ""STRIP"" tests I and the consonants S, T, P.

 Both are good. But ""ROILS"" tests an extra vowel (O) and we get more information about vowels.

 However, we are only allowed one guess. Let me choose ""ROILS"" because it tests more vowels.

 But note: the word must be valid. ""ROILS"" is a valid word (it means third-person singular of roil).

 Alternatively, a more common word: ""ROUSE"" -> but E is excluded. So no.

 ""ROBIN"" has N -> excluded.

 ""ROBOT"" has B and T, but duplicate O? Actually, no duplicate in ""ROBOT"": R, O, B, O, T -> wait, two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has two O's? Let me check: R-O-B-O-T -> that's two O's? No: R, O, B, O, T -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:O, 5:T -> two O's. So duplicate.

 How about ""ROWDY"": R, O, W, D, Y -> no duplicates. But we are testing less common letters.

 I think ""ROILS"" is acceptable.

 Another common word: ""SPOIL"": S, P, O, I, L. But we haven't tried P. And R is not in this word? But we know R is in the word. So we must include R.

 Therefore, we cannot use a word without R.

 So we must include R (and avoid position 2).

 After considering, I think ""STRIP"" is a solid choice because it tests S, T, I, P and R in position 3.

 But let me also consider ""PORTS"": P, O, R, T, S. R is in position 3 -> okay. And we test O as well.

 ""PORTS"": P(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). This tests P, O, R, T, S. And we avoid duplicates and excluded letters.

 This seems even better because we test O and also common consonants.

 But note: we are testing O in position 2. We don't know if that's good or bad.

 However, we are not violating any known constraints.

 So ""PORTS"" is a candidate.

 Now, comparing:
   - ""ROILS"": tests R (pos1), O (pos2), I (pos3), L (pos4), S (pos5)
   - ""PORTS"": tests P (pos1), O (pos2), R (pos3), T (pos4), S (pos5)

 Both are good. But ""PORTS"" tests T (a very common letter) and avoids I (which we can test later). And we get to see if O is in the word.

 However, we are testing O in position 2. We don't have any information about position 2 except that R is not there.

 I think I'll go with ""PORTS"" because it tests more common consonants (T and S) and the vowel O.

 But note: we are testing 5 new letters: P, O, R, T, S. And we already know R is in the word, so we are effectively testing P, O, T, S.

 This is a good set.

 Alternatively, ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T -> same letters as ""PORTS"", but arranged differently. But we can choose any arrangement as long as R is not in position 2.

 In ""SPORT"": S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). R is in position 4 -> okay.

 But we are testing the same letters. So it doesn't matter.

 I think ""PORTS"" is fine.

 However, let me check if ""PORTS"" is a valid word. Yes.

 So I will go with ""PORTS"".

 But wait: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in a position we haven't tested at all, such as position 4 or 5.

 For example, ""STORY"": S, T, O, R, Y. R is in position 4. And we avoid excluded letters. But we have Y? And we are testing O and Y.

 But Y is less common. And we are not testing as many common consonants.

 I think ""PORTS"" is better.

 Final decision: ""PORTS""

 Let me write it: P O R T S

 But note: the word is ""PORTS"".

 So my second guess is ""PORTS"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked with ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include R (avoiding position 2).
- Exclude C, A, N, E.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, P) to gather more information.

The word ""PORTS"" is chosen because:
- It includes R in position 3 (a new position to test).
- It tests new common letters: P, O, T, S.
- It avoids excluded letters and position 2 for R.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>ports</guess>",ports,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was at position 2 and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E.
   - Contains the letter R (but not in the second position).

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We know the word must have an R. Since R is not in position 2, we can try placing R in a different position.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (since position 2 is wrong).

 We also want to test other common letters.

 Let's consider a word that has R in a different position and includes other common consonants and vowels (but avoiding the excluded letters).

 Since we don't have any vowels from the first guess (A and E are out), we need to try other vowels: I, O, U.

 Let's try to include at least two vowels and the R.

 Example: ""ROUST"" has R, O, U, S, T. But note: R is in the first position. However, we don't know if that's allowed. Also, we haven't tried O, U, S, T.

 But wait: we must avoid the letters that are not in the word (C, A, N, E). So ""ROUST"" is okay.

 However, we have to consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a position we haven't tested, such as position 3 or 4.

 But note: we don't have much information, so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me list some words that fit:
 - ""TRIES"": has T, R, I, E, S -> but E is excluded (from feedback: E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.
 - ""PROUD"": has P, R, O, U, D -> but we haven't tried P, O, U, D. Also, R is in position 2? But wait, in ""crane"" R was in position 2 and we know it's not there. So in ""PROUD"", R is in position 2 again? That would be the same position. We should avoid putting R in position 2 because we know it's not there.

 Therefore, we must avoid position 2 for R.

 So ""PROUD"" is not good because R is in position 2.

 Let me try ""SPRIG"": but S, P, R, I, G. However, R is in position 3? But note: we have 5 letters. ""SPRIG"": S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). So R is in position 3. Also, we avoid A, E, N, C. But we have not tried S, P, I, G.

 However, we must also note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Another idea: ""ROBIN"" -> but N is excluded (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

 How about ""ROILS"": R(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). But we are putting R in position 1 and O in position 2. We don't know about O. However, we are avoiding the excluded letters.

 But note: we are also avoiding A, E, N, C. So ""ROILS"" is acceptable.

 However, we are using O and I (vowels) and L, S (consonants). This seems good.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTS"" but that has duplicate S? And we don't want duplicates necessarily.

 Another common word: ""TRAIL"" -> but T, R, A, I, L. But A is excluded. So we cannot use A.

 How about ""TROIS"": T, R, O, I, S. R is in position 2? We must avoid position 2 for R. In ""TROIS"": T(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), S(5). So R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

 Let me try ""STRIP"": S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). R is in position 3 -> okay. And we avoid the excluded letters.

 So ""STRIP"" is a candidate.

 Another candidate: ""SPRIT"" (if valid) -> but let's stick to common words. ""SPRIT"" is not very common. Instead, ""SPRIG"" as I thought earlier? But ""SPRIG"" is valid.

 However, we want to test more vowels? ""STRIP"" has the vowel I.

 But we haven't tested O or U. Maybe we should try a word with O or U.

 How about ""ROOMY"": but O is repeated and we don't know if O is in the word. Also, we have Y. But let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""ROGUE"" -> but E is excluded. So no.

 ""ROUND"" -> but N is excluded.

 ""ROWDY"": R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5). This avoids the excluded letters. And R is in position 1 (which is not position 2, so allowed). We test O, W, D, Y.

 But we are not testing as many common letters as we could.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 I think ""ROILS"" is a good candidate: R in position 1, and then O, I, L, S.

 But note: we are putting R in position 1. It might be correct? We don't know. But we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can put R in position 3 or 4 to see if it fits there.

 Let me think of a word that has R in position 3: for example, ""BIRCH"" -> but B, I, R, C, H. But C is excluded (from first feedback: C is not in the word). So we cannot use C.

 ""DIRTY"": D, I, R, T, Y. R is in position 3. And we avoid excluded letters. So D, I, R, T, Y.

 But we haven't tried D, I, T, Y. And we know R is in the word.

 Another word: ""FIRST"": F, I, R, S, T. R in position 3. And F, I, S, T are new.

 ""FIRST"" is a good candidate because it has common letters.

 But note: we are also missing vowels. We have I (a vowel) in position 2.

 Let me compare ""FIRST"" and ""STRIP"":
   - ""FIRST"": F(1), I(2), R(3), S(4), T(5)
   - ""STRIP"": S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5)

 Both have R in position 3. But ""STRIP"" uses P and ""FIRST"" uses F. Both are reasonable.

 However, we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know E, A, N are out. So T, O, I, S are good.

 ""STRIP"" has S, T, R, I, P -> that's 5 new letters (except R which we know is in). And we are testing S, T, I, P.

 ""FIRST"" has F, I, R, S, T -> testing F, I, S, T.

 Since F is less common than P? Actually, P is more common than F. But both are acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that includes O. Since we haven't tested O, it might be in the word.

 Let me try to form a word with R and O, and without the excluded letters.

 Example: ""BROOD"" -> duplicate O? and we don't know about B and D.

 ""PROUD"" is not allowed because R is in position 2.

 ""ROBOT"" -> has B, O, T. But R is in position 1. And we avoid excluded letters? Yes, because no C, A, N, E. But we have O and T.

 However, we have duplicate O? And we are not testing many letters.

 Another word: ""ROOST"" -> R(1), O(2), O(3), S(4), T(5). Duplicate O, which is not ideal.

 How about ""ROTIS"" (if valid) -> not common. Instead, ""ROSIT"" is not common.

 I think ""ROILS"" is still a candidate: R(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). We test R, O, I, L, S. And we avoid duplicates.

 But note: we are putting R in position 1. We don't know if that's correct. But we are allowed to try.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ORBIT"": O(1), R(2), B(3), I(4), T(5). But wait, R is in position 2 -> we know that position 2 is wrong for R. So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""ORBIT"" is invalid because it puts R in the wrong position we already know.

 So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, in ""ROILS"", R is in position 1 -> okay.

 Now, let me decide between ""STRIP"", ""FIRST"", and ""ROILS"".

 We want to test the vowel O? We haven't tested O, so it might be in the word. Similarly, we haven't tested I and U.

 Since we have limited vowels (only I, O, U available because A and E are out), we should test at least one of them.

 ""STRIP"" tests I (in position 4) and ""ROILS"" tests O and I.

 So ""ROILS"" tests two vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (L and S). It also tests R in a new position (1).

 ""STRIP"" tests I and the consonants S, T, P.

 Both are good. But ""ROILS"" tests an extra vowel (O) and we get more information about vowels.

 However, we are only allowed one guess. Let me choose ""ROILS"" because it tests more vowels.

 But note: the word must be valid. ""ROILS"" is a valid word (it means third-person singular of roil).

 Alternatively, a more common word: ""ROUSE"" -> but E is excluded. So no.

 ""ROBIN"" has N -> excluded.

 ""ROBOT"" has B and T, but duplicate O? Actually, no duplicate in ""ROBOT"": R, O, B, O, T -> wait, two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has two O's? Let me check: R-O-B-O-T -> that's two O's? No: R, O, B, O, T -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:O, 5:T -> two O's. So duplicate.

 How about ""ROWDY"": R, O, W, D, Y -> no duplicates. But we are testing less common letters.

 I think ""ROILS"" is acceptable.

 Another common word: ""SPOIL"": S, P, O, I, L. But we haven't tried P. And R is not in this word? But we know R is in the word. So we must include R.

 Therefore, we cannot use a word without R.

 So we must include R (and avoid position 2).

 After considering, I think ""STRIP"" is a solid choice because it tests S, T, I, P and R in position 3.

 But let me also consider ""PORTS"": P, O, R, T, S. R is in position 3 -> okay. And we test O as well.

 ""PORTS"": P(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). This tests P, O, R, T, S. And we avoid duplicates and excluded letters.

 This seems even better because we test O and also common consonants.

 But note: we are testing O in position 2. We don't know if that's good or bad.

 However, we are not violating any known constraints.

 So ""PORTS"" is a candidate.

 Now, comparing:
   - ""ROILS"": tests R (pos1), O (pos2), I (pos3), L (pos4), S (pos5)
   - ""PORTS"": tests P (pos1), O (pos2), R (pos3), T (pos4), S (pos5)

 Both are good. But ""PORTS"" tests T (a very common letter) and avoids I (which we can test later). And we get to see if O is in the word.

 However, we are testing O in position 2. We don't have any information about position 2 except that R is not there.

 I think I'll go with ""PORTS"" because it tests more common consonants (T and S) and the vowel O.

 But note: we are testing 5 new letters: P, O, R, T, S. And we already know R is in the word, so we are effectively testing P, O, T, S.

 This is a good set.

 Alternatively, ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T -> same letters as ""PORTS"", but arranged differently. But we can choose any arrangement as long as R is not in position 2.

 In ""SPORT"": S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). R is in position 4 -> okay.

 But we are testing the same letters. So it doesn't matter.

 I think ""PORTS"" is fine.

 However, let me check if ""PORTS"" is a valid word. Yes.

 So I will go with ""PORTS"".

 But wait: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in a position we haven't tested at all, such as position 4 or 5.

 For example, ""STORY"": S, T, O, R, Y. R is in position 4. And we avoid excluded letters. But we have Y? And we are testing O and Y.

 But Y is less common. And we are not testing as many common consonants.

 I think ""PORTS"" is better.

 Final decision: ""PORTS""

 Let me write it: P O R T S

 But note: the word is ""PORTS"".

 So my second guess is ""PORTS"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked with ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include R (avoiding position 2).
- Exclude C, A, N, E.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, P) to gather more information.

The word ""PORTS"" is chosen because:
- It includes R in position 3 (a new position to test).
- It tests new common letters: P, O, T, S.
- It avoids excluded letters and position 2 for R.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.",Guess 2: ports -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,HUMOR,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was at position 2 and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E.
   - Contains the letter R (but not in the second position).

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We know the word must have an R. Since R is not in position 2, we can try placing R in a different position.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (since position 2 is wrong).

 We also want to test other common letters.

 Let's consider a word that has R in a different position and includes other common consonants and vowels (but avoiding the excluded letters).

 Since we don't have any vowels from the first guess (A and E are out), we need to try other vowels: I, O, U.

 Let's try to include at least two vowels and the R.

 Example: ""ROUST"" has R, O, U, S, T. But note: R is in the first position. However, we don't know if that's allowed. Also, we haven't tried O, U, S, T.

 But wait: we must avoid the letters that are not in the word (C, A, N, E). So ""ROUST"" is okay.

 However, we have to consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a position we haven't tested, such as position 3 or 4.

 But note: we don't have much information, so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me list some words that fit:
 - ""TRIES"": has T, R, I, E, S -> but E is excluded (from feedback: E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.
 - ""PROUD"": has P, R, O, U, D -> but we haven't tried P, O, U, D. Also, R is in position 2? But wait, in ""crane"" R was in position 2 and we know it's not there. So in ""PROUD"", R is in position 2 again? That would be the same position. We should avoid putting R in position 2 because we know it's not there.

 Therefore, we must avoid position 2 for R.

 So ""PROUD"" is not good because R is in position 2.

 Let me try ""SPRIG"": but S, P, R, I, G. However, R is in position 3? But note: we have 5 letters. ""SPRIG"": S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). So R is in position 3. Also, we avoid A, E, N, C. But we have not tried S, P, I, G.

 However, we must also note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Another idea: ""ROBIN"" -> but N is excluded (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

 How about ""ROILS"": R(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). But we are putting R in position 1 and O in position 2. We don't know about O. However, we are avoiding the excluded letters.

 But note: we are also avoiding A, E, N, C. So ""ROILS"" is acceptable.

 However, we are using O and I (vowels) and L, S (consonants). This seems good.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTS"" but that has duplicate S? And we don't want duplicates necessarily.

 Another common word: ""TRAIL"" -> but T, R, A, I, L. But A is excluded. So we cannot use A.

 How about ""TROIS"": T, R, O, I, S. R is in position 2? We must avoid position 2 for R. In ""TROIS"": T(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), S(5). So R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

 Let me try ""STRIP"": S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). R is in position 3 -> okay. And we avoid the excluded letters.

 So ""STRIP"" is a candidate.

 Another candidate: ""SPRIT"" (if valid) -> but let's stick to common words. ""SPRIT"" is not very common. Instead, ""SPRIG"" as I thought earlier? But ""SPRIG"" is valid.

 However, we want to test more vowels? ""STRIP"" has the vowel I.

 But we haven't tested O or U. Maybe we should try a word with O or U.

 How about ""ROOMY"": but O is repeated and we don't know if O is in the word. Also, we have Y. But let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""ROGUE"" -> but E is excluded. So no.

 ""ROUND"" -> but N is excluded.

 ""ROWDY"": R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5). This avoids the excluded letters. And R is in position 1 (which is not position 2, so allowed). We test O, W, D, Y.

 But we are not testing as many common letters as we could.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 I think ""ROILS"" is a good candidate: R in position 1, and then O, I, L, S.

 But note: we are putting R in position 1. It might be correct? We don't know. But we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can put R in position 3 or 4 to see if it fits there.

 Let me think of a word that has R in position 3: for example, ""BIRCH"" -> but B, I, R, C, H. But C is excluded (from first feedback: C is not in the word). So we cannot use C.

 ""DIRTY"": D, I, R, T, Y. R is in position 3. And we avoid excluded letters. So D, I, R, T, Y.

 But we haven't tried D, I, T, Y. And we know R is in the word.

 Another word: ""FIRST"": F, I, R, S, T. R in position 3. And F, I, S, T are new.

 ""FIRST"" is a good candidate because it has common letters.

 But note: we are also missing vowels. We have I (a vowel) in position 2.

 Let me compare ""FIRST"" and ""STRIP"":
   - ""FIRST"": F(1), I(2), R(3), S(4), T(5)
   - ""STRIP"": S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5)

 Both have R in position 3. But ""STRIP"" uses P and ""FIRST"" uses F. Both are reasonable.

 However, we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know E, A, N are out. So T, O, I, S are good.

 ""STRIP"" has S, T, R, I, P -> that's 5 new letters (except R which we know is in). And we are testing S, T, I, P.

 ""FIRST"" has F, I, R, S, T -> testing F, I, S, T.

 Since F is less common than P? Actually, P is more common than F. But both are acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that includes O. Since we haven't tested O, it might be in the word.

 Let me try to form a word with R and O, and without the excluded letters.

 Example: ""BROOD"" -> duplicate O? and we don't know about B and D.

 ""PROUD"" is not allowed because R is in position 2.

 ""ROBOT"" -> has B, O, T. But R is in position 1. And we avoid excluded letters? Yes, because no C, A, N, E. But we have O and T.

 However, we have duplicate O? And we are not testing many letters.

 Another word: ""ROOST"" -> R(1), O(2), O(3), S(4), T(5). Duplicate O, which is not ideal.

 How about ""ROTIS"" (if valid) -> not common. Instead, ""ROSIT"" is not common.

 I think ""ROILS"" is still a candidate: R(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). We test R, O, I, L, S. And we avoid duplicates.

 But note: we are putting R in position 1. We don't know if that's correct. But we are allowed to try.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ORBIT"": O(1), R(2), B(3), I(4), T(5). But wait, R is in position 2 -> we know that position 2 is wrong for R. So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""ORBIT"" is invalid because it puts R in the wrong position we already know.

 So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, in ""ROILS"", R is in position 1 -> okay.

 Now, let me decide between ""STRIP"", ""FIRST"", and ""ROILS"".

 We want to test the vowel O? We haven't tested O, so it might be in the word. Similarly, we haven't tested I and U.

 Since we have limited vowels (only I, O, U available because A and E are out), we should test at least one of them.

 ""STRIP"" tests I (in position 4) and ""ROILS"" tests O and I.

 So ""ROILS"" tests two vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (L and S). It also tests R in a new position (1).

 ""STRIP"" tests I and the consonants S, T, P.

 Both are good. But ""ROILS"" tests an extra vowel (O) and we get more information about vowels.

 However, we are only allowed one guess. Let me choose ""ROILS"" because it tests more vowels.

 But note: the word must be valid. ""ROILS"" is a valid word (it means third-person singular of roil).

 Alternatively, a more common word: ""ROUSE"" -> but E is excluded. So no.

 ""ROBIN"" has N -> excluded.

 ""ROBOT"" has B and T, but duplicate O? Actually, no duplicate in ""ROBOT"": R, O, B, O, T -> wait, two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has two O's? Let me check: R-O-B-O-T -> that's two O's? No: R, O, B, O, T -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:O, 5:T -> two O's. So duplicate.

 How about ""ROWDY"": R, O, W, D, Y -> no duplicates. But we are testing less common letters.

 I think ""ROILS"" is acceptable.

 Another common word: ""SPOIL"": S, P, O, I, L. But we haven't tried P. And R is not in this word? But we know R is in the word. So we must include R.

 Therefore, we cannot use a word without R.

 So we must include R (and avoid position 2).

 After considering, I think ""STRIP"" is a solid choice because it tests S, T, I, P and R in position 3.

 But let me also consider ""PORTS"": P, O, R, T, S. R is in position 3 -> okay. And we test O as well.

 ""PORTS"": P(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). This tests P, O, R, T, S. And we avoid duplicates and excluded letters.

 This seems even better because we test O and also common consonants.

 But note: we are testing O in position 2. We don't know if that's good or bad.

 However, we are not violating any known constraints.

 So ""PORTS"" is a candidate.

 Now, comparing:
   - ""ROILS"": tests R (pos1), O (pos2), I (pos3), L (pos4), S (pos5)
   - ""PORTS"": tests P (pos1), O (pos2), R (pos3), T (pos4), S (pos5)

 Both are good. But ""PORTS"" tests T (a very common letter) and avoids I (which we can test later). And we get to see if O is in the word.

 However, we are testing O in position 2. We don't have any information about position 2 except that R is not there.

 I think I'll go with ""PORTS"" because it tests more common consonants (T and S) and the vowel O.

 But note: we are testing 5 new letters: P, O, R, T, S. And we already know R is in the word, so we are effectively testing P, O, T, S.

 This is a good set.

 Alternatively, ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T -> same letters as ""PORTS"", but arranged differently. But we can choose any arrangement as long as R is not in position 2.

 In ""SPORT"": S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). R is in position 4 -> okay.

 But we are testing the same letters. So it doesn't matter.

 I think ""PORTS"" is fine.

 However, let me check if ""PORTS"" is a valid word. Yes.

 So I will go with ""PORTS"".

 But wait: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in a position we haven't tested at all, such as position 4 or 5.

 For example, ""STORY"": S, T, O, R, Y. R is in position 4. And we avoid excluded letters. But we have Y? And we are testing O and Y.

 But Y is less common. And we are not testing as many common consonants.

 I think ""PORTS"" is better.

 Final decision: ""PORTS""

 Let me write it: P O R T S

 But note: the word is ""PORTS"".

 So my second guess is ""PORTS"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked with ""-"").

- Must include R (avoiding position 2).
- Exclude C, A, N, E.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, P) to gather more information.

The word ""PORTS"" is chosen because:
- It includes R in position 3 (a new position to test).
- It tests new common letters: P, O, T, S.
- It avoids excluded letters and position 2 for R.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

But let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another word: ""ROGUE"" -> but E is excluded. So no.\n\n ""ROUND"" -> but N is excluded.\n\n ""ROWDY"": R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5). This avoids the excluded letters. And R is in position 1 (which is not position 2, so allowed). We test O, W, D, Y.\n\n But we are not testing as many common letters as we could.\n\n Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n I think ""ROILS"" is a good candidate: R in position 1, and then O, I, L, S.\n\n But note: we are putting R in position 1. It might be correct? We don\'t know. But we are trying to get information.\n\n Alternatively, we can put R in position 3 or 4 to see if it fits there.\n\n Let me think of a word that has R in position 3: for example, ""BIRCH"" -> but B, I, R, C, H. But C is excluded (from first feedback: C is not in the word). So we cannot use C.\n\n ""DIRTY"": D, I, R, T, Y. R is in position 3. And we avoid excluded letters. So D, I, R, T, Y.\n\n But we haven\'t tried D, I, T, Y. And we know R is in the word.\n\n Another word: ""FIRST"": F, I, R, S, T. R in position 3. And F, I, S, T are new.\n\n ""FIRST"" is a good candidate because it has common letters.\n\n But note: we are also missing vowels. We have I (a vowel) in position 2.\n\n Let me compare ""FIRST"" and ""STRIP"":\n   - ""FIRST"": F(1), I(2), R(3), S(4), T(5)\n   - ""STRIP"": S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5)\n\n Both have R in position 3. But ""STRIP"" uses P and ""FIRST"" uses F. Both are reasonable.\n\n However, we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know E, A, N are out. So T, O, I, S are good.\n\n ""STRIP"" has S, T, R, I, P -> that\'s 5 new letters (except R which we know is in). And we are testing S, T, I, P.\n\n ""FIRST"" has F, I, R, S, T -> testing F, I, S, T.\n\n Since F is less common than P? Actually, P is more common than F. But both are acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that includes O. Since we haven\'t tested O, it might be in the word.\n\n Let me try to form a word with R and O, and without the excluded letters.\n\n Example: ""BROOD"" -> duplicate O? and we don\'t know about B and D.\n\n ""PROUD"" is not allowed because R is in position 2.\n\n ""ROBOT"" -> has B, O, T. But R is in position 1. And we avoid excluded letters? Yes, because no C, A, N, E. But we have O and T.\n\n However, we have duplicate O? And we are not testing many letters.\n\n Another word: ""ROOST"" -> R(1), O(2), O(3), S(4), T(5). Duplicate O, which is not ideal.\n\n How about ""ROTIS"" (if valid) -> not common. Instead, ""ROSIT"" is not common.\n\n I think ""ROILS"" is still a candidate: R(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). We test R, O, I, L, S. And we avoid duplicates.\n\n But note: we are putting R in position 1. We don\'t know if that\'s correct. But we are allowed to try.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ORBIT"": O(1), R(2), B(3), I(4), T(5). But wait, R is in position 2 -> we know that position 2 is wrong for R. So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""ORBIT"" is invalid because it puts R in the wrong position we already know.\n\n So we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Therefore, in ""ROILS"", R is in position 1 -> okay.\n\n Now, let me decide between ""STRIP"", ""FIRST"", and ""ROILS"".\n\n We want to test the vowel O? We haven\'t tested O, so it might be in the word. Similarly, we haven\'t tested I and U.\n\n Since we have limited vowels (only I, O, U available because A and E are out), we should test at least one of them.\n\n ""STRIP"" tests I (in position 4) and ""ROILS"" tests O and I.\n\n So ""ROILS"" tests two vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (L and S). It also tests R in a new position (1).\n\n ""STRIP"" tests I and the consonants S, T, P.\n\n Both are good. But ""ROILS"" tests an extra vowel (O) and we get more information about vowels.\n\n However, we are only allowed one guess. Let me choose ""ROILS"" because it tests more vowels.\n\n But note: the word must be valid. ""ROILS"" is a valid word (it means third-person singular of roil).\n\n Alternatively, a more common word: ""ROUSE"" -> but E is excluded. So no.\n\n ""ROBIN"" has N -> excluded.\n\n ""ROBOT"" has B and T, but duplicate O? Actually, no duplicate in ""ROBOT"": R, O, B, O, T -> wait, two O\'s? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has two O\'s? Let me check: R-O-B-O-T -> that\'s two O\'s? No: R, O, B, O, T -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:O, 5:T -> two O\'s. So duplicate.\n\n How about ""ROWDY"": R, O, W, D, Y -> no duplicates. But we are testing less common letters.\n\n I think ""ROILS"" is acceptable.\n\n Another common word: ""SPOIL"": S, P, O, I, L. But we haven\'t tried P. And R is not in this word? But we know R is in the word. So we must include R.\n\n Therefore, we cannot use a word without R.\n\n So we must include R (and avoid position 2).\n\n After considering, I think ""STRIP"" is a solid choice because it tests S, T, I, P and R in position 3.\n\n But let me also consider ""PORTS"": P, O, R, T, S. R is in position 3 -> okay. And we test O as well.\n\n ""PORTS"": P(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). This tests P, O, R, T, S. And we avoid duplicates and excluded letters.\n\n This seems even better because we test O and also common consonants.\n\n But note: we are testing O in position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s good or bad.\n\n However, we are not violating any known constraints.\n\n So ""PORTS"" is a candidate.\n\n Now, comparing:\n   - ""ROILS"": tests R (pos1), O (pos2), I (pos3), L (pos4), S (pos5)\n   - ""PORTS"": tests P (pos1), O (pos2), R (pos3), T (pos4), S (pos5)\n\n Both are good. But ""PORTS"" tests T (a very common letter) and avoids I (which we can test later). And we get to see if O is in the word.\n\n However, we are testing O in position 2. We don\'t have any information about position 2 except that R is not there.\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""PORTS"" because it tests more common consonants (T and S) and the vowel O.\n\n But note: we are testing 5 new letters: P, O, R, T, S. And we already know R is in the word, so we are effectively testing P, O, T, S.\n\n This is a good set.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T -> same letters as ""PORTS"", but arranged differently. But we can choose any arrangement as long as R is not in position 2.\n\n In ""SPORT"": S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). R is in position 4 -> okay.\n\n But we are testing the same letters. So it doesn\'t matter.\n\n I think ""PORTS"" is fine.\n\n However, let me check if ""PORTS"" is a valid word. Yes.\n\n So I will go with ""PORTS"".\n\n But wait: we are putting R in position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are trying to get information.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in a position we haven\'t tested at all, such as position 4 or 5.\n\n For example, ""STORY"": S, T, O, R, Y. R is in position 4. And we avoid excluded letters. But we have Y? And we are testing O and Y.\n\n But Y is less common. And we are not testing as many common consonants.\n\n I think ""PORTS"" is better.\n\n Final decision: ""PORTS""\n\n Let me write it: P O R T S\n\n But note: the word is ""PORTS"".\n\n So my second guess is ""PORTS"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked with ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include R (avoiding position 2).\n- Exclude C, A, N, E.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, P) to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""PORTS"" is chosen because:\n- It includes R in position 3 (a new position to test).\n- It tests new common letters: P, O, T, S.\n- It avoids excluded letters and position 2 for R.\n- It is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>ports</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ports -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word but wrong position)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Second guess ""ports"":
  P: x (not in word)
  O: - (in word but wrong position)
  R: - (in word but wrong position) but note: different position than in ""crane""
  T: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)

Summary of known information:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, P, T, S (since they got 'x' in both guesses)
- Included letters: R and O (both have '-' in at least one guess)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""crane"") and not in position 3 (from ""ports"", because R was in position 3 and got '-', meaning it's not in position 3).
- O is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""ports"", because O was in position 2 and got '-', so position 2 is wrong for O).

Now, the known letters in the word are R and O. We must find a 5-letter word that contains R and O, and excludes C,A,N,E,P,T,S.

Additionally, note the positions:
- From ""crane"": R was in position 2 and was wrong -> R cannot be in position 2.
- From ""ports"": O was in position 2 and wrong -> O cannot be in position 2? Actually, in ""ports"", O was in position 2 (the second letter) and we got '-'. That means O is in the word but not in position 2?
  But note: the feedback symbol is per letter. So for O in position 2, '-' means that O is in the word, but not at that position. Similarly for R in position 3: R is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore, we have:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""ports"").
- O cannot be in position 2 (from ""ports"").

Now, what positions are left for R? The secret word has 5 positions. R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since 2 and 3 are ruled out).

Similarly, O can be in any position except 2? But we don't know if O could be in 1,3,4,5 because we haven't tested them all. However, we only know it cannot be in position 2 from the ""ports"" feedback.

We also know that the word must not contain the excluded letters (C,A,N,E,P,T,S) and must contain R and O. Also, the word must be composed of letters we haven't excluded.

What letters are available? We have used: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,R,T,S. So we can use other letters, such as:
- Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Vowels: I, U (since O is already included, and A,E are excluded)

We need to form a 5-letter word with R and O and three other letters from the available set.

We also have two positions where R can be (1,4,5) and O can be in any position except 2? Actually, we don't have constraints on O's position except from the feedback we have.

But note: in ""ports"", we had O in position 2 and got '-', so O is not in position 2. Similarly, we might have other constraints.

We must also consider that we have two occurrences of R? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates. The word may have duplicate letters? But the feedback symbols account for each occurrence. However, we haven't seen any duplicates yet, so we assume no duplicates unless necessary.

But to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until feedback suggests.

So we look for a word that contains R and O (each at least once) and 3 other distinct letters that are not excluded.

Now, we want to maximize information by testing new letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, U, etc.

We try to form a word that uses common letters and places R in one of the possible positions (1,4,5) and O in a position that is not 2.

Let me brainstorm some words:

Option 1: R at position 1
- Example: ""R O _ _ _""
  We need to fill the rest without the excluded letters. And O must not be at position 2? Actually, word must contain O, and position 2 is not O because we haven't fixed O's position. But in this form, we can put O later.

Word: ""ROBIN"" -> but N is excluded -> invalid.

Word: ""ROWDY"": R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but O is in position 2? We know O cannot be in position 2! Because in ""ports"" we tried O in position 2 and it was wrong. Therefore, we cannot put O in position 2. So ""ROWDY"" is invalid.

Similarly, any word with R in position 1 and O in position 2 is invalid.

So if R is in position 1, O must be in positions 3,4, or 5.

Example: ""R_ O _ _"": We need a letter in position 2? And then O in position 3 or later.

Word: ""R O L E D"" -> E and D? But E is excluded.

Word: ""R O U G H"" -> has O in position 2 -> invalid.

Word: ""R U O M S"" -> invalid because S excluded and O in position 3? Also, not a word.

How about ""R O I L S"" -> O in position 2 -> invalid.

What words start with R, then not O, then O? For example: ""R U O ..."" -> not common.

How about ""R O B O T"" -> duplicate O and O in position 2? Not allowed.

Alternative: ""R E B U S"" -> E excluded.

It's challenging.

Let me try R in position 4 or 5.

Option 2: R at position 4
- Example: ""_ _ _ R _""

We need to include O somewhere (not position 2? Actually, we have no constraint on O yet for other positions). We avoid position 2 for O because of the feedback.

So O can be in positions 1,3,5? and not 2.

Word: ""B O O R Y"" -> duplicate O -> avoid, but also O in position 2? no, position 2 would be the second O? Let's spell: B(1), O(2), O(3), R(4), Y(5) -> now O is in position 2? That would be bad because we know O cannot be in position 2? Wait no: in position 2 we put O? Then we would get '-' because O is in the word but not at the correct position if the secret word has O not at 2? But we don't know if there's an O. Also, we have two O's? Complex.

Better to avoid O in position 2 entirely.

So let me look for words without O in position 2.

Word: ""F L O R A"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

Word: ""G L O R Y"" -> G(1), L(2), O(3), R(4), Y(5) -> O is in position 3 -> allowed. Excluded letters? G, L, O, R, Y -> none of C,A,N,E,P,T,S -> acceptable.

Similarly, ""C L O R K"" -> C excluded -> invalid.

Word: ""H O R D E"" -> E excluded -> invalid.

How about ""M O R R Y"" -> duplicate R? Not assumed.

Word: ""DOLLY"" -> no R, so must have R.

Another: ""F O R U M"" -> O in position 2 -> invalid? Because O in position 2 is the same as in ""ports"" and we know it's not there? But wait, in ""F O R U M"", O is in position 2 -> that would be wrong because we know O is not in position 2? So we must avoid having O in position 2.

Therefore, for ""G L O R Y"": 
- O is in position 3 -> okay.
- R is in position 4 -> okay (since we haven't tested position 4 for R).

Option 3: R at position 5
- Example: ""_ _ _ _ R"" and O somewhere (not position 2).

Word: ""H E L O R"" -> E excluded.

Word: ""C O M I R"" -> C excluded.

Word: ""G O _ _ R"": with O in position 2 -> invalid.

Word: ""L O O R S"" -> duplicate O and S excluded.

Word: ""D I L O R"" -> D(1), I(2), L(3), O(4), R(5). Here O is in position 4 -> allowed. And letters D,I,L,O,R -> none excluded. Valid word? ""DILOR"" not common. ""DOLOR"" -> D(1), O(2), L(3), O(4), R(5) -> O in position 2 -> invalid.

Another: ""M A J O R"" -> A excluded.

It seems harder.

Therefore, let's consider ""GLORY"" as a candidate. It tests G, L, O, R, Y. R is in position 4 (a new position) and O is in position 3 (not position 2). We also test G, L, Y.

But note: we haven't tested any of G, L, Y. Also, we cover the required R and O.

Another candidate: if R is at position 1 and O at position 4. For example: ""R _ _ O _""

Word: ""R H Y O L"" -> not common.

Word: ""R U B O L"" -> not common.

Word: ""R I B O L"" -> not common.

Perhaps ""BROLY"" -> but B(1), R(2), O(3), L(4), Y(5). Then R is in position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2! So invalid.

How about ""R O D _ _"" but without O in position 2? It's tricky.

Let me think of common words containing R and O:

- ""FLOUR"" -> F,L,O,U,R. Let's check positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), R(5). So R at position 5, O at position 3 -> acceptable? Positions: O is not in 2? Yes, position 3. And R not in 2 or 3 (here position 5). So valid. Letters: F,L,O,U,R -> none excluded.

""FLOUR"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""FLOUR"" vs ""GLORY"":

- ""GLORY"": tests G,L,O,R,Y
- ""FLOUR"": tests F,L,O,U,R. Both are good.

But ""FLOUR"" introduces U (a vowel) which is valuable.

Earlier I considered U, and in ""FLOUR"" we have U.

We have only tried R and O for vowels? We have A and E excluded. So U is a good vowel to test.

Also, U is less common than other letters? But it's a vowel.

Now, let me compare:

- In ""FLOUR"": 
  - R is in position 5 -> new position.
  - O is in position 3 -> new position.
- In ""GLORY"":
  - R in position 4 -> new position.
  - O in position 3 -> same as above.

But ""FLOUR"" has the vowel U, which we haven't tested at all. Similarly, ""GLORY"" has Y (which can be a vowel or consonant).

I think testing U is more important because it's a vowel and we don't know if the secret word has U.

But we don't have any vowels except O so far? Actually, O is one vowel, and we don't know what vowels are in the word except O. We know A and E are out.

We should test U and I to cover possibilities.

In ""FLOUR"", we test L and F again? Which we haven't tested individually, but we did test L in ""crane"" ? No, in ""crane"" we tested C,R,A,N,E. So L is new.

Similarly, F is new.

Therefore, I think ""FLOUR"" is a good candidate.

Another common word: ""CHOIR"" -> C excluded -> invalid.

Another: ""MOURN"" -> M,O,U,R,N -> excluded N -> invalid.

""DOUBT"" -> D,O,U,B,T -> but T excluded, and no R -> invalid.

""GROUP"" -> G,R,O,U,P -> P excluded? Because in ""ports"" P got x. So we cannot use P.

Therefore, ""FLOUR"" remains a candidate.

Another word: ""VODKA"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

""BROWN"": B,R,O,W,N -> N excluded -> invalid.

""GROW"": not 5 letters.

So I think ""FLOUR"" is a solid choice.

But wait: let's ensure we cover more letters? We have two vowels O and U in one word.

Another possibility: ""LOURY"" -> not common.

Therefore, I choose ""FLOUR"".

But note: in ""FLOUR"", we have O in position 3 and R in position 5. We haven't ruled out these positions for R and O.

Therefore, we'll use ""FLOUR"".

So the third guess: ""FLOUR"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E, P, T, S (marked with ""x"" in guesses 1 and 2).
- **Included letters**: R and O (marked with ""-"" in at least one guess).
- Position constraints:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""ports"").
  - O cannot be in position 2 (from ""ports"").
- Possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5.
- Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- The secret word contains both R and O.

For the third guess, I chose ""FLOUR"" because:
- It includes R (in position 5) and O (in position 3), testing new positions for both letters.
- It uses new letters (F, L, U) that haven't been tested yet, maximizing information gain.
- It avoids all excluded letters.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>flour</guess>",flour,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word but wrong position)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Second guess ""ports"":
  P: x (not in word)
  O: - (in word but wrong position)
  R: - (in word but wrong position) but note: different position than in ""crane""
  T: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)

Summary of known information:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, P, T, S (since they got 'x' in both guesses)
- Included letters: R and O (both have '-' in at least one guess)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""crane"") and not in position 3 (from ""ports"", because R was in position 3 and got '-', meaning it's not in position 3).
- O is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""ports"", because O was in position 2 and got '-', so position 2 is wrong for O).

Now, the known letters in the word are R and O. We must find a 5-letter word that contains R and O, and excludes C,A,N,E,P,T,S.

Additionally, note the positions:
- From ""crane"": R was in position 2 and was wrong -> R cannot be in position 2.
- From ""ports"": O was in position 2 and wrong -> O cannot be in position 2? Actually, in ""ports"", O was in position 2 (the second letter) and we got '-'. That means O is in the word but not in position 2?
  But note: the feedback symbol is per letter. So for O in position 2, '-' means that O is in the word, but not at that position. Similarly for R in position 3: R is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore, we have:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""ports"").
- O cannot be in position 2 (from ""ports"").

Now, what positions are left for R? The secret word has 5 positions. R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since 2 and 3 are ruled out).

Similarly, O can be in any position except 2? But we don't know if O could be in 1,3,4,5 because we haven't tested them all. However, we only know it cannot be in position 2 from the ""ports"" feedback.

We also know that the word must not contain the excluded letters (C,A,N,E,P,T,S) and must contain R and O. Also, the word must be composed of letters we haven't excluded.

What letters are available? We have used: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,R,T,S. So we can use other letters, such as:
- Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Vowels: I, U (since O is already included, and A,E are excluded)

We need to form a 5-letter word with R and O and three other letters from the available set.

We also have two positions where R can be (1,4,5) and O can be in any position except 2? Actually, we don't have constraints on O's position except from the feedback we have.

But note: in ""ports"", we had O in position 2 and got '-', so O is not in position 2. Similarly, we might have other constraints.

We must also consider that we have two occurrences of R? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates. The word may have duplicate letters? But the feedback symbols account for each occurrence. However, we haven't seen any duplicates yet, so we assume no duplicates unless necessary.

But to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until feedback suggests.

So we look for a word that contains R and O (each at least once) and 3 other distinct letters that are not excluded.

Now, we want to maximize information by testing new letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, U, etc.

We try to form a word that uses common letters and places R in one of the possible positions (1,4,5) and O in a position that is not 2.

Let me brainstorm some words:

Option 1: R at position 1
- Example: ""R O _ _ _""
  We need to fill the rest without the excluded letters. And O must not be at position 2? Actually, word must contain O, and position 2 is not O because we haven't fixed O's position. But in this form, we can put O later.

Word: ""ROBIN"" -> but N is excluded -> invalid.

Word: ""ROWDY"": R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but O is in position 2? We know O cannot be in position 2! Because in ""ports"" we tried O in position 2 and it was wrong. Therefore, we cannot put O in position 2. So ""ROWDY"" is invalid.

Similarly, any word with R in position 1 and O in position 2 is invalid.

So if R is in position 1, O must be in positions 3,4, or 5.

Example: ""R_ O _ _"": We need a letter in position 2? And then O in position 3 or later.

Word: ""R O L E D"" -> E and D? But E is excluded.

Word: ""R O U G H"" -> has O in position 2 -> invalid.

Word: ""R U O M S"" -> invalid because S excluded and O in position 3? Also, not a word.

How about ""R O I L S"" -> O in position 2 -> invalid.

What words start with R, then not O, then O? For example: ""R U O ..."" -> not common.

How about ""R O B O T"" -> duplicate O and O in position 2? Not allowed.

Alternative: ""R E B U S"" -> E excluded.

It's challenging.

Let me try R in position 4 or 5.

Option 2: R at position 4
- Example: ""_ _ _ R _""

We need to include O somewhere (not position 2? Actually, we have no constraint on O yet for other positions). We avoid position 2 for O because of the feedback.

So O can be in positions 1,3,5? and not 2.

Word: ""B O O R Y"" -> duplicate O -> avoid, but also O in position 2? no, position 2 would be the second O? Let's spell: B(1), O(2), O(3), R(4), Y(5) -> now O is in position 2? That would be bad because we know O cannot be in position 2? Wait no: in position 2 we put O? Then we would get '-' because O is in the word but not at the correct position if the secret word has O not at 2? But we don't know if there's an O. Also, we have two O's? Complex.

Better to avoid O in position 2 entirely.

So let me look for words without O in position 2.

Word: ""F L O R A"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

Word: ""G L O R Y"" -> G(1), L(2), O(3), R(4), Y(5) -> O is in position 3 -> allowed. Excluded letters? G, L, O, R, Y -> none of C,A,N,E,P,T,S -> acceptable.

Similarly, ""C L O R K"" -> C excluded -> invalid.

Word: ""H O R D E"" -> E excluded -> invalid.

How about ""M O R R Y"" -> duplicate R? Not assumed.

Word: ""DOLLY"" -> no R, so must have R.

Another: ""F O R U M"" -> O in position 2 -> invalid? Because O in position 2 is the same as in ""ports"" and we know it's not there? But wait, in ""F O R U M"", O is in position 2 -> that would be wrong because we know O is not in position 2? So we must avoid having O in position 2.

Therefore, for ""G L O R Y"": 
- O is in position 3 -> okay.
- R is in position 4 -> okay (since we haven't tested position 4 for R).

Option 3: R at position 5
- Example: ""_ _ _ _ R"" and O somewhere (not position 2).

Word: ""H E L O R"" -> E excluded.

Word: ""C O M I R"" -> C excluded.

Word: ""G O _ _ R"": with O in position 2 -> invalid.

Word: ""L O O R S"" -> duplicate O and S excluded.

Word: ""D I L O R"" -> D(1), I(2), L(3), O(4), R(5). Here O is in position 4 -> allowed. And letters D,I,L,O,R -> none excluded. Valid word? ""DILOR"" not common. ""DOLOR"" -> D(1), O(2), L(3), O(4), R(5) -> O in position 2 -> invalid.

Another: ""M A J O R"" -> A excluded.

It seems harder.

Therefore, let's consider ""GLORY"" as a candidate. It tests G, L, O, R, Y. R is in position 4 (a new position) and O is in position 3 (not position 2). We also test G, L, Y.

But note: we haven't tested any of G, L, Y. Also, we cover the required R and O.

Another candidate: if R is at position 1 and O at position 4. For example: ""R _ _ O _""

Word: ""R H Y O L"" -> not common.

Word: ""R U B O L"" -> not common.

Word: ""R I B O L"" -> not common.

Perhaps ""BROLY"" -> but B(1), R(2), O(3), L(4), Y(5). Then R is in position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2! So invalid.

How about ""R O D _ _"" but without O in position 2? It's tricky.

Let me think of common words containing R and O:

- ""FLOUR"" -> F,L,O,U,R. Let's check positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), R(5). So R at position 5, O at position 3 -> acceptable? Positions: O is not in 2? Yes, position 3. And R not in 2 or 3 (here position 5). So valid. Letters: F,L,O,U,R -> none excluded.

""FLOUR"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""FLOUR"" vs ""GLORY"":

- ""GLORY"": tests G,L,O,R,Y
- ""FLOUR"": tests F,L,O,U,R. Both are good.

But ""FLOUR"" introduces U (a vowel) which is valuable.

Earlier I considered U, and in ""FLOUR"" we have U.

We have only tried R and O for vowels? We have A and E excluded. So U is a good vowel to test.

Also, U is less common than other letters? But it's a vowel.

Now, let me compare:

- In ""FLOUR"": 
  - R is in position 5 -> new position.
  - O is in position 3 -> new position.
- In ""GLORY"":
  - R in position 4 -> new position.
  - O in position 3 -> same as above.

But ""FLOUR"" has the vowel U, which we haven't tested at all. Similarly, ""GLORY"" has Y (which can be a vowel or consonant).

I think testing U is more important because it's a vowel and we don't know if the secret word has U.

But we don't have any vowels except O so far? Actually, O is one vowel, and we don't know what vowels are in the word except O. We know A and E are out.

We should test U and I to cover possibilities.

In ""FLOUR"", we test L and F again? Which we haven't tested individually, but we did test L in ""crane"" ? No, in ""crane"" we tested C,R,A,N,E. So L is new.

Similarly, F is new.

Therefore, I think ""FLOUR"" is a good candidate.

Another common word: ""CHOIR"" -> C excluded -> invalid.

Another: ""MOURN"" -> M,O,U,R,N -> excluded N -> invalid.

""DOUBT"" -> D,O,U,B,T -> but T excluded, and no R -> invalid.

""GROUP"" -> G,R,O,U,P -> P excluded? Because in ""ports"" P got x. So we cannot use P.

Therefore, ""FLOUR"" remains a candidate.

Another word: ""VODKA"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

""BROWN"": B,R,O,W,N -> N excluded -> invalid.

""GROW"": not 5 letters.

So I think ""FLOUR"" is a solid choice.

But wait: let's ensure we cover more letters? We have two vowels O and U in one word.

Another possibility: ""LOURY"" -> not common.

Therefore, I choose ""FLOUR"".

But note: in ""FLOUR"", we have O in position 3 and R in position 5. We haven't ruled out these positions for R and O.

Therefore, we'll use ""FLOUR"".

So the third guess: ""FLOUR"".Based on the previous feedback:
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E, P, T, S (marked with ""x"" in guesses 1 and 2).
- **Included letters**: R and O (marked with ""-"" in at least one guess).
- Position constraints:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""ports"").
  - O cannot be in position 2 (from ""ports"").
- Possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5.
- Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- The secret word contains both R and O.

For the third guess, I chose ""FLOUR"" because:
- It includes R (in position 5) and O (in position 3), testing new positions for both letters.
- It uses new letters (F, L, U) that haven't been tested yet, maximizing information gain.
- It avoids all excluded letters.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.",Guess 3: flour -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) O(-) U(-) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,HUMOR,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was at position 2 and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 6 tries and this is the second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E.
   - Contains the letter R (but not in the second position).

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We know the word must have an R. Since R is not in position 2, we can try placing R in a different position.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (since position 2 is wrong).

 We also want to test other common letters.

 Let's consider a word that has R in a different position and includes other common consonants and vowels (but avoiding the excluded letters).

 Since we don't have any vowels from the first guess (A and E are out), we need to try other vowels: I, O, U.

 Let's try to include at least two vowels and the R.

 Example: ""ROUST"" has R, O, U, S, T. But note: R is in the first position. However, we don't know if that's allowed. Also, we haven't tried O, U, S, T.

 But wait: we must avoid the letters that are not in the word (C, A, N, E). So ""ROUST"" is okay.

 However, we have to consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a position we haven't tested, such as position 3 or 4.

 But note: we don't have much information, so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me list some words that fit:
 - ""TRIES"": has T, R, I, E, S -> but E is excluded (from feedback: E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.
 - ""PROUD"": has P, R, O, U, D -> but we haven't tried P, O, U, D. Also, R is in position 2? But wait, in ""crane"" R was in position 2 and we know it's not there. So in ""PROUD"", R is in position 2 again? That would be the same position. We should avoid putting R in position 2 because we know it's not there.

 Therefore, we must avoid position 2 for R.

 So ""PROUD"" is not good because R is in position 2.

 Let me try ""SPRIG"": but S, P, R, I, G. However, R is in position 3? But note: we have 5 letters. ""SPRIG"": S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). So R is in position 3. Also, we avoid A, E, N, C. But we have not tried S, P, I, G.

 However, we must also note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Another idea: ""ROBIN"" -> but N is excluded (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

 How about ""ROILS"": R(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). But we are putting R in position 1 and O in position 2. We don't know about O. However, we are avoiding the excluded letters.

 But note: we are also avoiding A, E, N, C. So ""ROILS"" is acceptable.

 However, we are using O and I (vowels) and L, S (consonants). This seems good.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTS"" but that has duplicate S? And we don't want duplicates necessarily.

 Another common word: ""TRAIL"" -> but T, R, A, I, L. But A is excluded. So we cannot use A.

 How about ""TROIS"": T, R, O, I, S. R is in position 2? We must avoid position 2 for R. In ""TROIS"": T(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), S(5). So R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

 Let me try ""STRIP"": S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). R is in position 3 -> okay. And we avoid the excluded letters.

 So ""STRIP"" is a candidate.

 Another candidate: ""SPRIT"" (if valid) -> but let's stick to common words. ""SPRIT"" is not very common. Instead, ""SPRIG"" as I thought earlier? But ""SPRIG"" is valid.

 However, we want to test more vowels? ""STRIP"" has the vowel I.

 But we haven't tested O or U. Maybe we should try a word with O or U.

 How about ""ROOMY"": but O is repeated and we don't know if O is in the word. Also, we have Y. But let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""ROGUE"" -> but E is excluded. So no.

 ""ROUND"" -> but N is excluded.

 ""ROWDY"": R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5). This avoids the excluded letters. And R is in position 1 (which is not position 2, so allowed). We test O, W, D, Y.

 But we are not testing as many common letters as we could.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 I think ""ROILS"" is a good candidate: R in position 1, and then O, I, L, S.

 But note: we are putting R in position 1. It might be correct? We don't know. But we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can put R in position 3 or 4 to see if it fits there.

 Let me think of a word that has R in position 3: for example, ""BIRCH"" -> but B, I, R, C, H. But C is excluded (from first feedback: C is not in the word). So we cannot use C.

 ""DIRTY"": D, I, R, T, Y. R is in position 3. And we avoid excluded letters. So D, I, R, T, Y.

 But we haven't tried D, I, T, Y. And we know R is in the word.

 Another word: ""FIRST"": F, I, R, S, T. R in position 3. And F, I, S, T are new.

 ""FIRST"" is a good candidate because it has common letters.

 But note: we are also missing vowels. We have I (a vowel) in position 2.

 Let me compare ""FIRST"" and ""STRIP"":
   - ""FIRST"": F(1), I(2), R(3), S(4), T(5)
   - ""STRIP"": S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5)

 Both have R in position 3. But ""STRIP"" uses P and ""FIRST"" uses F. Both are reasonable.

 However, we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know E, A, N are out. So T, O, I, S are good.

 ""STRIP"" has S, T, R, I, P -> that's 5 new letters (except R which we know is in). And we are testing S, T, I, P.

 ""FIRST"" has F, I, R, S, T -> testing F, I, S, T.

 Since F is less common than P? Actually, P is more common than F. But both are acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that includes O. Since we haven't tested O, it might be in the word.

 Let me try to form a word with R and O, and without the excluded letters.

 Example: ""BROOD"" -> duplicate O? and we don't know about B and D.

 ""PROUD"" is not allowed because R is in position 2.

 ""ROBOT"" -> has B, O, T. But R is in position 1. And we avoid excluded letters? Yes, because no C, A, N, E. But we have O and T.

 However, we have duplicate O? And we are not testing many letters.

 Another word: ""ROOST"" -> R(1), O(2), O(3), S(4), T(5). Duplicate O, which is not ideal.

 How about ""ROTIS"" (if valid) -> not common. Instead, ""ROSIT"" is not common.

 I think ""ROILS"" is still a candidate: R(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). We test R, O, I, L, S. And we avoid duplicates.

 But note: we are putting R in position 1. We don't know if that's correct. But we are allowed to try.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ORBIT"": O(1), R(2), B(3), I(4), T(5). But wait, R is in position 2 -> we know that position 2 is wrong for R. So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""ORBIT"" is invalid because it puts R in the wrong position we already know.

 So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, in ""ROILS"", R is in position 1 -> okay.

 Now, let me decide between ""STRIP"", ""FIRST"", and ""ROILS"".

 We want to test the vowel O? We haven't tested O, so it might be in the word. Similarly, we haven't tested I and U.

 Since we have limited vowels (only I, O, U available because A and E are out), we should test at least one of them.

 ""STRIP"" tests I (in position 4) and ""ROILS"" tests O and I.

 So ""ROILS"" tests two vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (L and S). It also tests R in a new position (1).

 ""STRIP"" tests I and the consonants S, T, P.

 Both are good. But ""ROILS"" tests an extra vowel (O) and we get more information about vowels.

 However, we are only allowed one guess. Let me choose ""ROILS"" because it tests more vowels.

 But note: the word must be valid. ""ROILS"" is a valid word (it means third-person singular of roil).

 Alternatively, a more common word: ""ROUSE"" -> but E is excluded. So no.

 ""ROBIN"" has N -> excluded.

 ""ROBOT"" has B and T, but duplicate O? Actually, no duplicate in ""ROBOT"": R, O, B, O, T -> wait, two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has two O's? Let me check: R-O-B-O-T -> that's two O's? No: R, O, B, O, T -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:O, 5:T -> two O's. So duplicate.

 How about ""ROWDY"": R, O, W, D, Y -> no duplicates. But we are testing less common letters.

 I think ""ROILS"" is acceptable.

 Another common word: ""SPOIL"": S, P, O, I, L. But we haven't tried P. And R is not in this word? But we know R is in the word. So we must include R.

 Therefore, we cannot use a word without R.

 So we must include R (and avoid position 2).

 After considering, I think ""STRIP"" is a solid choice because it tests S, T, I, P and R in position 3.

 But let me also consider ""PORTS"": P, O, R, T, S. R is in position 3 -> okay. And we test O as well.

 ""PORTS"": P(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). This tests P, O, R, T, S. And we avoid duplicates and excluded letters.

 This seems even better because we test O and also common consonants.

 But note: we are testing O in position 2. We don't know if that's good or bad.

 However, we are not violating any known constraints.

 So ""PORTS"" is a candidate.

 Now, comparing:
   - ""ROILS"": tests R (pos1), O (pos2), I (pos3), L (pos4), S (pos5)
   - ""PORTS"": tests P (pos1), O (pos2), R (pos3), T (pos4), S (pos5)

 Both are good. But ""PORTS"" tests T (a very common letter) and avoids I (which we can test later). And we get to see if O is in the word.

 However, we are testing O in position 2. We don't have any information about position 2 except that R is not there.

 I think I'll go with ""PORTS"" because it tests more common consonants (T and S) and the vowel O.

 But note: we are testing 5 new letters: P, O, R, T, S. And we already know R is in the word, so we are effectively testing P, O, T, S.

 This is a good set.

 Alternatively, ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T -> same letters as ""PORTS"", but arranged differently. But we can choose any arrangement as long as R is not in position 2.

 In ""SPORT"": S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). R is in position 4 -> okay.

 But we are testing the same letters. So it doesn't matter.

 I think ""PORTS"" is fine.

 However, let me check if ""PORTS"" is a valid word. Yes.

 So I will go with ""PORTS"".

 But wait: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in a position we haven't tested at all, such as position 4 or 5.

 For example, ""STORY"": S, T, O, R, Y. R is in position 4. And we avoid excluded letters. But we have Y? And we are testing O and Y.

 But Y is less common. And we are not testing as many common consonants.

 I think ""PORTS"" is better.

 Final decision: ""PORTS""

 Let me write it: P O R T S

 But note: the word is ""PORTS"".

 So my second guess is ""PORTS"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked with ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include R (avoiding position 2).
- Exclude C, A, N, E.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, P) to gather more information.

The word ""PORTS"" is chosen because:
- It includes R in position 3 (a new position to test).
- It tests new common letters: P, O, T, S.
- It avoids excluded letters and position 2 for R.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

<guess>ports</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ports -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word but wrong position)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Second guess ""ports"":
  P: x (not in word)
  O: - (in word but wrong position)
  R: - (in word but wrong position) but note: different position than in ""crane""
  T: x (not in word)
  S: x (not in word)

Summary of known information:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, P, T, S (since they got 'x' in both guesses)
- Included letters: R and O (both have '-' in at least one guess)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""crane"") and not in position 3 (from ""ports"", because R was in position 3 and got '-', meaning it's not in position 3).
- O is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""ports"", because O was in position 2 and got '-', so position 2 is wrong for O).

Now, the known letters in the word are R and O. We must find a 5-letter word that contains R and O, and excludes C,A,N,E,P,T,S.

Additionally, note the positions:
- From ""crane"": R was in position 2 and was wrong -> R cannot be in position 2.
- From ""ports"": O was in position 2 and wrong -> O cannot be in position 2? Actually, in ""ports"", O was in position 2 (the second letter) and we got '-'. That means O is in the word but not in position 2?
  But note: the feedback symbol is per letter. So for O in position 2, '-' means that O is in the word, but not at that position. Similarly for R in position 3: R is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore, we have:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""ports"").
- O cannot be in position 2 (from ""ports"").

Now, what positions are left for R? The secret word has 5 positions. R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since 2 and 3 are ruled out).

Similarly, O can be in any position except 2? But we don't know if O could be in 1,3,4,5 because we haven't tested them all. However, we only know it cannot be in position 2 from the ""ports"" feedback.

We also know that the word must not contain the excluded letters (C,A,N,E,P,T,S) and must contain R and O. Also, the word must be composed of letters we haven't excluded.

What letters are available? We have used: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,R,T,S. So we can use other letters, such as:
- Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Vowels: I, U (since O is already included, and A,E are excluded)

We need to form a 5-letter word with R and O and three other letters from the available set.

We also have two positions where R can be (1,4,5) and O can be in any position except 2? Actually, we don't have constraints on O's position except from the feedback we have.

But note: in ""ports"", we had O in position 2 and got '-', so O is not in position 2. Similarly, we might have other constraints.

We must also consider that we have two occurrences of R? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates. The word may have duplicate letters? But the feedback symbols account for each occurrence. However, we haven't seen any duplicates yet, so we assume no duplicates unless necessary.

But to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until feedback suggests.

So we look for a word that contains R and O (each at least once) and 3 other distinct letters that are not excluded.

Now, we want to maximize information by testing new letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, U, etc.

We try to form a word that uses common letters and places R in one of the possible positions (1,4,5) and O in a position that is not 2.

Let me brainstorm some words:

Option 1: R at position 1
- Example: ""R O _ _ _""
  We need to fill the rest without the excluded letters. And O must not be at position 2? Actually, word must contain O, and position 2 is not O because we haven't fixed O's position. But in this form, we can put O later.

Word: ""ROBIN"" -> but N is excluded -> invalid.

Word: ""ROWDY"": R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but O is in position 2? We know O cannot be in position 2! Because in ""ports"" we tried O in position 2 and it was wrong. Therefore, we cannot put O in position 2. So ""ROWDY"" is invalid.

Similarly, any word with R in position 1 and O in position 2 is invalid.

So if R is in position 1, O must be in positions 3,4, or 5.

Example: ""R_ O _ _"": We need a letter in position 2? And then O in position 3 or later.

Word: ""R O L E D"" -> E and D? But E is excluded.

Word: ""R O U G H"" -> has O in position 2 -> invalid.

Word: ""R U O M S"" -> invalid because S excluded and O in position 3? Also, not a word.

How about ""R O I L S"" -> O in position 2 -> invalid.

What words start with R, then not O, then O? For example: ""R U O ..."" -> not common.

How about ""R O B O T"" -> duplicate O and O in position 2? Not allowed.

Alternative: ""R E B U S"" -> E excluded.

It's challenging.

Let me try R in position 4 or 5.

Option 2: R at position 4
- Example: ""_ _ _ R _""

We need to include O somewhere (not position 2? Actually, we have no constraint on O yet for other positions). We avoid position 2 for O because of the feedback.

So O can be in positions 1,3,5? and not 2.

Word: ""B O O R Y"" -> duplicate O -> avoid, but also O in position 2? no, position 2 would be the second O? Let's spell: B(1), O(2), O(3), R(4), Y(5) -> now O is in position 2? That would be bad because we know O cannot be in position 2? Wait no: in position 2 we put O? Then we would get '-' because O is in the word but not at the correct position if the secret word has O not at 2? But we don't know if there's an O. Also, we have two O's? Complex.

Better to avoid O in position 2 entirely.

So let me look for words without O in position 2.

Word: ""F L O R A"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

Word: ""G L O R Y"" -> G(1), L(2), O(3), R(4), Y(5) -> O is in position 3 -> allowed. Excluded letters? G, L, O, R, Y -> none of C,A,N,E,P,T,S -> acceptable.

Similarly, ""C L O R K"" -> C excluded -> invalid.

Word: ""H O R D E"" -> E excluded -> invalid.

How about ""M O R R Y"" -> duplicate R? Not assumed.

Word: ""DOLLY"" -> no R, so must have R.

Another: ""F O R U M"" -> O in position 2 -> invalid? Because O in position 2 is the same as in ""ports"" and we know it's not there? But wait, in ""F O R U M"", O is in position 2 -> that would be wrong because we know O is not in position 2? So we must avoid having O in position 2.

Therefore, for ""G L O R Y"": 
- O is in position 3 -> okay.
- R is in position 4 -> okay (since we haven't tested position 4 for R).

Option 3: R at position 5
- Example: ""_ _ _ _ R"" and O somewhere (not position 2).

Word: ""H E L O R"" -> E excluded.

Word: ""C O M I R"" -> C excluded.

Word: ""G O _ _ R"": with O in position 2 -> invalid.

Word: ""L O O R S"" -> duplicate O and S excluded.

Word: ""D I L O R"" -> D(1), I(2), L(3), O(4), R(5). Here O is in position 4 -> allowed. And letters D,I,L,O,R -> none excluded. Valid word? ""DILOR"" not common. ""DOLOR"" -> D(1), O(2), L(3), O(4), R(5) -> O in position 2 -> invalid.

Another: ""M A J O R"" -> A excluded.

It seems harder.

Therefore, let's consider ""GLORY"" as a candidate. It tests G, L, O, R, Y. R is in position 4 (a new position) and O is in position 3 (not position 2). We also test G, L, Y.

But note: we haven't tested any of G, L, Y. Also, we cover the required R and O.

Another candidate: if R is at position 1 and O at position 4. For example: ""R _ _ O _""

Word: ""R H Y O L"" -> not common.

Word: ""R U B O L"" -> not common.

Word: ""R I B O L"" -> not common.

Perhaps ""BROLY"" -> but B(1), R(2), O(3), L(4), Y(5). Then R is in position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2! So invalid.

How about ""R O D _ _"" but without O in position 2? It's tricky.

Let me think of common words containing R and O:

- ""FLOUR"" -> F,L,O,U,R. Let's check positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), R(5). So R at position 5, O at position 3 -> acceptable? Positions: O is not in 2? Yes, position 3. And R not in 2 or 3 (here position 5). So valid. Letters: F,L,O,U,R -> none excluded.

""FLOUR"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""FLOUR"" vs ""GLORY"":

- ""GLORY"": tests G,L,O,R,Y
- ""FLOUR"": tests F,L,O,U,R. Both are good.

But ""FLOUR"" introduces U (a vowel) which is valuable.

Earlier I considered U, and in ""FLOUR"" we have U.

We have only tried R and O for vowels? We have A and E excluded. So U is a good vowel to test.

Also, U is less common than other letters? But it's a vowel.

Now, let me compare:

- In ""FLOUR"": 
  - R is in position 5 -> new position.
  - O is in position 3 -> new position.
- In ""GLORY"":
  - R in position 4 -> new position.
  - O in position 3 -> same as above.

But ""FLOUR"" has the vowel U, which we haven't tested at all. Similarly, ""GLORY"" has Y (which can be a vowel or consonant).

I think testing U is more important because it's a vowel and we don't know if the secret word has U.

But we don't have any vowels except O so far? Actually, O is one vowel, and we don't know what vowels are in the word except O. We know A and E are out.

We should test U and I to cover possibilities.

In ""FLOUR"", we test L and F again? Which we haven't tested individually, but we did test L in ""crane"" ? No, in ""crane"" we tested C,R,A,N,E. So L is new.

Similarly, F is new.

Therefore, I think ""FLOUR"" is a good candidate.

Another common word: ""CHOIR"" -> C excluded -> invalid.

Another: ""MOURN"" -> M,O,U,R,N -> excluded N -> invalid.

""DOUBT"" -> D,O,U,B,T -> but T excluded, and no R -> invalid.

""GROUP"" -> G,R,O,U,P -> P excluded? Because in ""ports"" P got x. So we cannot use P.

Therefore, ""FLOUR"" remains a candidate.

Another word: ""VODKA"" -> A excluded -> invalid.

""BROWN"": B,R,O,W,N -> N excluded -> invalid.

""GROW"": not 5 letters.

So I think ""FLOUR"" is a solid choice.

But wait: let's ensure we cover more letters? We have two vowels O and U in one word.

Another possibility: ""LOURY"" -> not common.

Therefore, I choose ""FLOUR"".

But note: in ""FLOUR"", we have O in position 3 and R in position 5. We haven't ruled out these positions for R and O.

Therefore, we'll use ""FLOUR"".

So the third guess: ""FLOUR"".Based on the previous feedback:
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E, P, T, S (marked with ""x"" in guesses 1 and 2).
- **Included letters**: R and O (marked with ""-"" in at least one guess).
- Position constraints:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""ports"").
  - O cannot be in position 2 (from ""ports"").
- Possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5.
- Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- The secret word contains both R and O.

For the third guess, I chose ""FLOUR"" because:
- It includes R (in position 5) and O (in position 3), testing new positions for both letters.
- It uses new letters (F, L, U) that haven't been tested yet, maximizing information gain.
- It avoids all excluded letters.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word.

But note: R is in the first position. However, we don\'t know if that\'s allowed. Also, we haven\'t tried O, U, S, T.\n\n But wait: we must avoid the letters that are not in the word (C, A, N, E). So ""ROUST"" is okay.\n\n However, we have to consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a position we haven\'t tested, such as position 3 or 4.\n\n But note: we don\'t have much information, so we want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me list some words that fit:\n - ""TRIES"": has T, R, I, E, S -> but E is excluded (from feedback: E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.\n - ""PROUD"": has P, R, O, U, D -> but we haven\'t tried P, O, U, D. Also, R is in position 2? But wait, in ""crane"" R was in position 2 and we know it\'s not there. So in ""PROUD"", R is in position 2 again? That would be the same position. We should avoid putting R in position 2 because we know it\'s not there.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n So ""PROUD"" is not good because R is in position 2.\n\n Let me try ""SPRIG"": but S, P, R, I, G. However, R is in position 3? But note: we have 5 letters. ""SPRIG"": S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). So R is in position 3. Also, we avoid A, E, N, C. But we have not tried S, P, I, G.\n\n However, we must also note that the word must be a valid English word.\n\n Another idea: ""ROBIN"" -> but N is excluded (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.\n\n How about ""ROILS"": R(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). But we are putting R in position 1 and O in position 2. We don\'t know about O. However, we are avoiding the excluded letters.\n\n But note: we are also avoiding A, E, N, C. So ""ROILS"" is acceptable.\n\n However, we are using O and I (vowels) and L, S (consonants). This seems good.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTS"" but that has duplicate S? And we don\'t want duplicates necessarily.\n\n Another common word: ""TRAIL"" -> but T, R, A, I, L. But A is excluded. So we cannot use A.\n\n How about ""TROIS"": T, R, O, I, S. R is in position 2? We must avoid position 2 for R. In ""TROIS"": T(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), S(5). So R is in position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n Let me try ""STRIP"": S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). R is in position 3 -> okay. And we avoid the excluded letters.\n\n So ""STRIP"" is a candidate.\n\n Another candidate: ""SPRIT"" (if valid) -> but let\'s stick to common words. ""SPRIT"" is not very common. Instead, ""SPRIG"" as I thought earlier? But ""SPRIG"" is valid.\n\n However, we want to test more vowels? ""STRIP"" has the vowel I.\n\n But we haven\'t tested O or U. Maybe we should try a word with O or U.\n\n How about ""ROOMY"": but O is repeated and we don\'t know if O is in the word. Also, we have Y. But let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another word: ""ROGUE"" -> but E is excluded. So no.\n\n ""ROUND"" -> but N is excluded.\n\n ""ROWDY"": R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5). This avoids the excluded letters. And R is in position 1 (which is not position 2, so allowed). We test O, W, D, Y.\n\n But we are not testing as many common letters as we could.\n\n Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n I think ""ROILS"" is a good candidate: R in position 1, and then O, I, L, S.\n\n But note: we are putting R in position 1. It might be correct? We don\'t know. But we are trying to get information.\n\n Alternatively, we can put R in position 3 or 4 to see if it fits there.\n\n Let me think of a word that has R in position 3: for example, ""BIRCH"" -> but B, I, R, C, H. But C is excluded (from first feedback: C is not in the word). So we cannot use C.\n\n ""DIRTY"": D, I, R, T, Y. R is in position 3. And we avoid excluded letters. So D, I, R, T, Y.\n\n But we haven\'t tried D, I, T, Y. And we know R is in the word.\n\n Another word: ""FIRST"": F, I, R, S, T. R in position 3. And F, I, S, T are new.\n\n ""FIRST"" is a good candidate because it has common letters.\n\n But note: we are also missing vowels. We have I (a vowel) in position 2.\n\n Let me compare ""FIRST"" and ""STRIP"":\n   - ""FIRST"": F(1), I(2), R(3), S(4), T(5)\n   - ""STRIP"": S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5)\n\n Both have R in position 3. But ""STRIP"" uses P and ""FIRST"" uses F. Both are reasonable.\n\n However, we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know E, A, N are out. So T, O, I, S are good.\n\n ""STRIP"" has S, T, R, I, P -> that\'s 5 new letters (except R which we know is in). And we are testing S, T, I, P.\n\n ""FIRST"" has F, I, R, S, T -> testing F, I, S, T.\n\n Since F is less common than P? Actually, P is more common than F. But both are acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that includes O. Since we haven\'t tested O, it might be in the word.\n\n Let me try to form a word with R and O, and without the excluded letters.\n\n Example: ""BROOD"" -> duplicate O? and we don\'t know about B and D.\n\n ""PROUD"" is not allowed because R is in position 2.\n\n ""ROBOT"" -> has B, O, T. But R is in position 1. And we avoid excluded letters? Yes, because no C, A, N, E. But we have O and T.\n\n However, we have duplicate O? And we are not testing many letters.\n\n Another word: ""ROOST"" -> R(1), O(2), O(3), S(4), T(5). Duplicate O, which is not ideal.\n\n How about ""ROTIS"" (if valid) -> not common. Instead, ""ROSIT"" is not common.\n\n I think ""ROILS"" is still a candidate: R(1), O(2), I(3), L(4), S(5). We test R, O, I, L, S. And we avoid duplicates.\n\n But note: we are putting R in position 1. We don\'t know if that\'s correct. But we are allowed to try.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ORBIT"": O(1), R(2), B(3), I(4), T(5). But wait, R is in position 2 -> we know that position 2 is wrong for R. So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""ORBIT"" is invalid because it puts R in the wrong position we already know.\n\n So we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Therefore, in ""ROILS"", R is in position 1 -> okay.\n\n Now, let me decide between ""STRIP"", ""FIRST"", and ""ROILS"".\n\n We want to test the vowel O? We haven\'t tested O, so it might be in the word. Similarly, we haven\'t tested I and U.\n\n Since we have limited vowels (only I, O, U available because A and E are out), we should test at least one of them.\n\n ""STRIP"" tests I (in position 4) and ""ROILS"" tests O and I.\n\n So ""ROILS"" tests two vowels (O and I) and two common consonants (L and S). It also tests R in a new position (1).\n\n ""STRIP"" tests I and the consonants S, T, P.\n\n Both are good. But ""ROILS"" tests an extra vowel (O) and we get more information about vowels.\n\n However, we are only allowed one guess. Let me choose ""ROILS"" because it tests more vowels.\n\n But note: the word must be valid. ""ROILS"" is a valid word (it means third-person singular of roil).\n\n Alternatively, a more common word: ""ROUSE"" -> but E is excluded. So no.\n\n ""ROBIN"" has N -> excluded.\n\n ""ROBOT"" has B and T, but duplicate O? Actually, no duplicate in ""ROBOT"": R, O, B, O, T -> wait, two O\'s? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has two O\'s? Let me check: R-O-B-O-T -> that\'s two O\'s? No: R, O, B, O, T -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:B, 4:O, 5:T -> two O\'s. So duplicate.\n\n How about ""ROWDY"": R, O, W, D, Y -> no duplicates. But we are testing less common letters.\n\n I think ""ROILS"" is acceptable.\n\n Another common word: ""SPOIL"": S, P, O, I, L. But we haven\'t tried P. And R is not in this word? But we know R is in the word. So we must include R.\n\n Therefore, we cannot use a word without R.\n\n So we must include R (and avoid position 2).\n\n After considering, I think ""STRIP"" is a solid choice because it tests S, T, I, P and R in position 3.\n\n But let me also consider ""PORTS"": P, O, R, T, S. R is in position 3 -> okay. And we test O as well.\n\n ""PORTS"": P(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). This tests P, O, R, T, S. And we avoid duplicates and excluded letters.\n\n This seems even better because we test O and also common consonants.\n\n But note: we are testing O in position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s good or bad.\n\n However, we are not violating any known constraints.\n\n So ""PORTS"" is a candidate.\n\n Now, comparing:\n   - ""ROILS"": tests R (pos1), O (pos2), I (pos3), L (pos4), S (pos5)\n   - ""PORTS"": tests P (pos1), O (pos2), R (pos3), T (pos4), S (pos5)\n\n Both are good. But ""PORTS"" tests T (a very common letter) and avoids I (which we can test later). And we get to see if O is in the word.\n\n However, we are testing O in position 2. We don\'t have any information about position 2 except that R is not there.\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""PORTS"" because it tests more common consonants (T and S) and the vowel O.\n\n But note: we are testing 5 new letters: P, O, R, T, S. And we already know R is in the word, so we are effectively testing P, O, T, S.\n\n This is a good set.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T -> same letters as ""PORTS"", but arranged differently. But we can choose any arrangement as long as R is not in position 2.\n\n In ""SPORT"": S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). R is in position 4 -> okay.\n\n But we are testing the same letters. So it doesn\'t matter.\n\n I think ""PORTS"" is fine.\n\n However, let me check if ""PORTS"" is a valid word. Yes.\n\n So I will go with ""PORTS"".\n\n But wait: we are putting R in position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are trying to get information.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in a position we haven\'t tested at all, such as position 4 or 5.\n\n For example, ""STORY"": S, T, O, R, Y. R is in position 4. And we avoid excluded letters. But we have Y? And we are testing O and Y.\n\n But Y is less common. And we are not testing as many common consonants.\n\n I think ""PORTS"" is better.\n\n Final decision: ""PORTS""\n\n Let me write it: P O R T S\n\n But note: the word is ""PORTS"".\n\n So my second guess is ""PORTS"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").\n- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (marked with ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include R (avoiding position 2).\n- Exclude C, A, N, E.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, P) to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""PORTS"" is chosen because:\n- It includes R in position 3 (a new position to test).\n- It tests new common letters: P, O, T, S.\n- It avoids excluded letters and position 2 for R.\n- It is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>ports</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ports -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess ""crane"": \n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: - (in word but wrong position)\n  A: x (not in word)\n  N: x (not in word)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nSecond guess ""ports"":\n  P: x (not in word)\n  O: - (in word but wrong position)\n  R: - (in word but wrong position) but note: different position than in ""crane""\n  T: x (not in word)\n  S: x (not in word)\n\nSummary of known information:\n- Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, P, T, S (since they got \'x\' in both guesses)\n- Included letters: R and O (both have \'-\' in at least one guess)\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""crane"") and not in position 3 (from ""ports"", because R was in position 3 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s not in position 3).\n- O is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""ports"", because O was in position 2 and got \'-\', so position 2 is wrong for O).\n\nNow, the known letters in the word are R and O. We must find a 5-letter word that contains R and O, and excludes C,A,N,E,P,T,S.\n\nAdditionally, note the positions:\n- From ""crane"": R was in position 2 and was wrong -> R cannot be in position 2.\n- From ""ports"": O was in position 2 and wrong -> O cannot be in position 2? Actually, in ""ports"", O was in position 2 (the second letter) and we got \'-\'. That means O is in the word but not in position 2?\n  But note: the feedback symbol is per letter. So for O in position 2, \'-\' means that O is in the word, but not at that position. Similarly for R in position 3: R is in the word but not in position 3.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n- R cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""ports"").\n- O cannot be in position 2 (from ""ports"").\n\nNow, what positions are left for R? The secret word has 5 positions. R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since 2 and 3 are ruled out).\n\nSimilarly, O can be in any position except 2? But we don\'t know if O could be in 1,3,4,5 because we haven\'t tested them all. However, we only know it cannot be in position 2 from the ""ports"" feedback.\n\nWe also know that the word must not contain the excluded letters (C,A,N,E,P,T,S) and must contain R and O. Also, the word must be composed of letters we haven\'t excluded.\n\nWhat letters are available? We have used: C,R,A,N,E,P,O,R,T,S. So we can use other letters, such as:\n- Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n- Vowels: I, U (since O is already included, and A,E are excluded)\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word with R and O and three other letters from the available set.\n\nWe also have two positions where R can be (1,4,5) and O can be in any position except 2? Actually, we don\'t have constraints on O\'s position except from the feedback we have.\n\nBut note: in ""ports"", we had O in position 2 and got \'-\', so O is not in position 2. Similarly, we might have other constraints.\n\nWe must also consider that we have two occurrences of R? The feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates. The word may have duplicate letters? But the feedback symbols account for each occurrence. However, we haven\'t seen any duplicates yet, so we assume no duplicates unless necessary.\n\nBut to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until feedback suggests.\n\nSo we look for a word that contains R and O (each at least once) and 3 other distinct letters that are not excluded.\n\nNow, we want to maximize information by testing new letters.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, U, etc.\n\nWe try to form a word that uses common letters and places R in one of the possible positions (1,4,5) and O in a position that is not 2.\n\nLet me brainstorm some words:\n\nOption 1: R at position 1\n- Example: ""R O _ _ _""\n  We need to fill the rest without the excluded letters. And O must not be at position 2? Actually, word must contain O, and position 2 is not O because we haven\'t fixed O\'s position. But in this form, we can put O later.\n\nWord: ""ROBIN"" -> but N is excluded -> invalid.\n\nWord: ""ROWDY"": R(1), O(2), W(3), D(4), Y(5) -> but O is in position 2? We know O cannot be in position 2! Because in ""ports"" we tried O in position 2 and it was wrong. Therefore, we cannot put O in position 2. So ""ROWDY"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, any word with R in position 1 and O in position 2 is invalid.\n\nSo if R is in position 1, O must be in positions 3,4, or 5.\n\nExample: ""R_ O _ _"": We need a letter in position 2? And then O in position 3 or later.\n\nWord: ""R O L E D"" -> E and D? But E is excluded.\n\nWord: ""R O U G H"" -> has O in position 2 -> invalid.\n\nWord: ""R U O M S"" -> invalid because S excluded and O in position 3? Also, not a word.\n\nHow about ""R O I L S"" -> O in position 2 -> invalid.\n\nWhat words start with R, then not O, then O? For example: ""R U O ..."" -> not common.\n\nHow about ""R O B O T"" -> duplicate O and O in position 2? Not allowed.\n\nAlternative: ""R E B U S"" -> E excluded.\n\nIt\'s challenging.\n\nLet me try R in position 4 or 5.\n\nOption 2: R at position 4\n- Example: ""_ _ _ R _""\n\nWe need to include O somewhere (not position 2? Actually, we have no constraint on O yet for other positions). We avoid position 2 for O because of the feedback.\n\nSo O can be in positions 1,3,5? and not 2.\n\nWord: ""B O O R Y"" -> duplicate O -> avoid, but also O in position 2? no, position 2 would be the second O? Let\'s spell: B(1), O(2), O(3), R(4), Y(5) -> now O is in position 2? That would be bad because we know O cannot be in position 2? Wait no: in position 2 we put O? Then we would get \'-\' because O is in the word but not at the correct position if the secret word has O not at 2? But we don\'t know if there\'s an O. Also, we have two O\'s? Complex.\n\nBetter to avoid O in position 2 entirely.\n\nSo let me look for words without O in position 2.\n\nWord: ""F L O R A"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n\nWord: ""G L O R Y"" -> G(1), L(2), O(3), R(4), Y(5) -> O is in position 3 -> allowed. Excluded letters? G, L, O, R, Y -> none of C,A,N,E,P,T,S -> acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, ""C L O R K"" -> C excluded -> invalid.\n\nWord: ""H O R D E"" -> E excluded -> invalid.\n\nHow about ""M O R R Y"" -> duplicate R? Not assumed.\n\nWord: ""DOLLY"" -> no R, so must have R.\n\nAnother: ""F O R U M"" -> O in position 2 -> invalid? Because O in position 2 is the same as in ""ports"" and we know it\'s not there? But wait, in ""F O R U M"", O is in position 2 -> that would be wrong because we know O is not in position 2? So we must avoid having O in position 2.\n\nTherefore, for ""G L O R Y"": \n- O is in position 3 -> okay.\n- R is in position 4 -> okay (since we haven\'t tested position 4 for R).\n\nOption 3: R at position 5\n- Example: ""_ _ _ _ R"" and O somewhere (not position 2).\n\nWord: ""H E L O R"" -> E excluded.\n\nWord: ""C O M I R"" -> C excluded.\n\nWord: ""G O _ _ R"": with O in position 2 -> invalid.\n\nWord: ""L O O R S"" -> duplicate O and S excluded.\n\nWord: ""D I L O R"" -> D(1), I(2), L(3), O(4), R(5). Here O is in position 4 -> allowed. And letters D,I,L,O,R -> none excluded. Valid word? ""DILOR"" not common. ""DOLOR"" -> D(1), O(2), L(3), O(4), R(5) -> O in position 2 -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""M A J O R"" -> A excluded.\n\nIt seems harder.\n\nTherefore, let\'s consider ""GLORY"" as a candidate. It tests G, L, O, R, Y. R is in position 4 (a new position) and O is in position 3 (not position 2). We also test G, L, Y.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested any of G, L, Y. Also, we cover the required R and O.\n\nAnother candidate: if R is at position 1 and O at position 4. For example: ""R _ _ O _""\n\nWord: ""R H Y O L"" -> not common.\n\nWord: ""R U B O L"" -> not common.\n\nWord: ""R I B O L"" -> not common.\n\nPerhaps ""BROLY"" -> but B(1), R(2), O(3), L(4), Y(5). Then R is in position 2? We know R cannot be in position 2! So invalid.\n\nHow about ""R O D _ _"" but without O in position 2? It\'s tricky.\n\nLet me think of common words containing R and O:\n\n- ""FLOUR"" -> F,L,O,U,R. Let\'s check positions: F(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), R(5). So R at position 5, O at position 3 -> acceptable? Positions: O is not in 2? Yes, position 3. And R not in 2 or 3 (here position 5). So valid. Letters: F,L,O,U,R -> none excluded.\n\n""FLOUR"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLOUR"" vs ""GLORY"":\n\n- ""GLORY"": tests G,L,O,R,Y\n- ""FLOUR"": tests F,L,O,U,R. Both are good.\n\nBut ""FLOUR"" introduces U (a vowel) which is valuable.\n\nEarlier I considered U, and in ""FLOUR"" we have U.\n\nWe have only tried R and O for vowels? We have A and E excluded. So U is a good vowel to test.\n\nAlso, U is less common than other letters? But it\'s a vowel.\n\nNow, let me compare:\n\n- In ""FLOUR"": \n  - R is in position 5 -> new position.\n  - O is in position 3 -> new position.\n- In ""GLORY"":\n  - R in position 4 -> new position.\n  - O in position 3 -> same as above.\n\nBut ""FLOUR"" has the vowel U, which we haven\'t tested at all. Similarly, ""GLORY"" has Y (which can be a vowel or consonant).\n\nI think testing U is more important because it\'s a vowel and we don\'t know if the secret word has U.\n\nBut we don\'t have any vowels except O so far? Actually, O is one vowel, and we don\'t know what vowels are in the word except O. We know A and E are out.\n\nWe should test U and I to cover possibilities.\n\nIn ""FLOUR"", we test L and F again? Which we haven\'t tested individually, but we did test L in ""crane"" ? No, in ""crane"" we tested C,R,A,N,E. So L is new.\n\nSimilarly, F is new.\n\nTherefore, I think ""FLOUR"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother common word: ""CHOIR"" -> C excluded -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""MOURN"" -> M,O,U,R,N -> excluded N -> invalid.\n\n""DOUBT"" -> D,O,U,B,T -> but T excluded, and no R -> invalid.\n\n""GROUP"" -> G,R,O,U,P -> P excluded? Because in ""ports"" P got x. So we cannot use P.\n\nTherefore, ""FLOUR"" remains a candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""VODKA"" -> A excluded -> invalid.\n\n""BROWN"": B,R,O,W,N -> N excluded -> invalid.\n\n""GROW"": not 5 letters.\n\nSo I think ""FLOUR"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut wait: let\'s ensure we cover more letters? We have two vowels O and U in one word.\n\nAnother possibility: ""LOURY"" -> not common.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""FLOUR"".\n\nBut note: in ""FLOUR"", we have O in position 3 and R in position 5. We haven\'t ruled out these positions for R and O.\n\nTherefore, we\'ll use ""FLOUR"".\n\nSo the third guess: ""FLOUR"".Based on the previous feedback:\n- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E, P, T, S (marked with ""x"" in guesses 1 and 2).\n- **Included letters**: R and O (marked with ""-"" in at least one guess).\n- Position constraints:\n  - R cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 3 (from ""ports"").\n  - O cannot be in position 2 (from ""ports"").\n- Possible positions for R: 1, 4, or 5.\n- Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n- The secret word contains both R and O.\n\nFor the third guess, I chose ""FLOUR"" because:\n- It includes R (in position 5) and O (in position 3), testing new positions for both letters.\n- It uses new letters (F, L, U) that haven\'t been tested yet, maximizing information gain.\n- It avoids all excluded letters.\n- It is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\n<guess>flour</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ports -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) R(-) T(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: flour -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) O(-) U(-) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the third guess ""flour"":
  F: x (not in the word)
  L: x (not in the word)
  O: - (in the word but wrong position)
  U: - (in the word but wrong position)
  R: ✓ (correct position)

So, we now know:
- R is in the word and in position 5 (since we got a check for R in position 5 of ""flour"").
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (because we got a minus for O in position 3).
- U is in the word but not in position 4 (because we got a minus for U in position 4).
- F and L are not in the word.

Additionally, from previous guesses:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, P, T, S, F, L.
- Included letters: R (position 5 fixed), O, U.

We also have position constraints for O and U:
- O cannot be in position 2 (from ""ports"") and now also cannot be in position 3 (from ""flour"").
- U cannot be in position 4 (from ""flour"").

Moreover, R is fixed at position 5.

So the secret word has:
  _ _ _ _ R

And we know the word contains O and U, but not in the positions we've tried.

Possible positions for O: Since O cannot be in position 2 or 3, it can only be in position 1 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter, and we have U that also cannot be in position 4? Let me list:

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (with 5 being R)

Constraints:
- O: cannot be in 2 or 3 -> so O can be in 1 or 4.
- U: cannot be in 4 -> so U can be in 1, 2, or 3.

But note: if O is in position 4, then U cannot be in position 4, which is already satisfied. Also, we cannot have two letters in the same position, so O and U must be in different positions.

Moreover, we have three positions to fill (1,2,3) and two known letters (O and U) and one unknown letter? Actually, the word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 5 is R. So positions 1,2,3,4 must contain O, U, and two other letters? But we know the word has O and U, and we don't know about other letters.

Actually, we know the word has at least O, U, and R. There might be more letters? But we have only identified three letters so far: O, U, R. So we need two more letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, P, T, S, F, L.

Available letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use O, U, R but they are already in the word? We don't know if they are repeated. But we haven't seen any indication of duplicates, so we assume no duplicates for now.)

Therefore, we need two new letters for positions 1,2,3,4? Actually, positions 1,2,3,4 must be filled with O, U, and two other letters (since R is at 5).

But note: O and U must be placed in two of the positions 1,2,3,4, but with constraints:
- O: only positions 1 or 4 (because 2 and 3 are forbidden for O)
- U: positions 1,2,3 (but not 4)

However, if O is in position 4, then U cannot be in position 4 (which is already satisfied) and can be in 1,2,3. But if O is in position 1, then U can be in 2 or 3 (since 4 is forbidden for U? No, U is forbidden in 4, but 4 is available for other letters? Actually, U can be in 1,2,3, so if O is in 1, then U cannot be in 1 (duplicate? but we assume no duplicates) so U must be in 2 or 3.

Similarly, if O is in position 4, then U must be in 1,2, or 3.

Now, we also have to fill the remaining two positions with two new letters.

We need to form a word that fits.

Let me consider the two cases:

Case 1: O in position 1
  Then the word: O _ _ _ R
  U must be in position 2 or 3 (since position 4 is forbidden for U? Actually, U can be in 2 or 3, but not 4? Yes, from feedback U not in 4. And position 1 is taken by O, so U cannot be there. So U in 2 or 3.
  Then the remaining positions (if U in 2: then positions 3 and 4 are two new letters; if U in 3: then positions 2 and 4 are two new letters).

Case 2: O in position 4
  Then the word: _ _ _ O R
  U must be in position 1,2, or 3 (but not 4, which is taken by O). So U in 1,2, or 3, and the remaining two positions are the other two new letters.

We need to choose a word that tests these possibilities and uses common letters.

But note: we have only 6 tries and we are at guess 4. We want to maximize information.

We also know that the word must be valid.

Let me think of words that end with R and have O and U.

First, if O is in position 4: then the word is _ _ _ O R

Examples:
- ""M U R O R"" -> but duplicate R? and we have R at the end. Also, U in position 2? But we don't know. Also, M and U are available. But ""MUROr"" is not a word? Actually, ""muro"" is not English. 

- ""D U C O R"" -> C excluded -> invalid.

- ""G U I O R"" -> not a word.

- ""H U M O R"" -> H(1), U(2), M(3), O(4), R(5). This is a valid word. And we have U in position 2 -> allowed? We don't have any constraint that U cannot be in position 2? Only that U cannot be in position 4 (which is satisfied). Also, O in position 4 -> allowed? But wait, in this word, O is in position 4, which is the fourth position. And we have R in position 5. The letters: H, U, M, O, R. None excluded? H, U, M are not excluded. So ""HUMOR"" is a candidate.

Now, if O is in position 1: then O _ _ _ R

Examples:
- ""O U _ _ R"" -> but U in position 2? Then we have ""OU_ _ R"". Words: ""OUNCE"" -> E excluded. ""OUIJA"" -> A excluded. ""POUR"" -> only 4 letters? Not 5.

- ""O _ U _ R"": for example, ""O D U R A"" -> A excluded. ""O K U R A"" -> not a word.

- ""O _ _ U R"": for example, ""O P E U R"" -> P and E excluded. ""O M B U R"" -> B? and U in position 4? But U cannot be in position 4? From feedback, U is not in position 4. So we cannot put U in position 4. Therefore, in this case, if O is in position 1, U must be in position 2 or 3, not 4.

So for ""O _ _ U R"" is invalid because U would be in position 4? Actually, in ""O _ _ U R"", U is in position 4 -> which is forbidden. So we cannot have that.

Therefore, for case 1 (O in 1), U must be in 2 or 3, and the other positions are new letters.

But we found ""HUMOR"" which fits case 2.

Are there other words? For example, ""RUMOR"" -> but R is at the beginning? We have R at the end. ""RUMOR"" has R at position 1 and 5? But we have R fixed at position 5, so if we have R at position 1, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We haven't encountered any duplicate feedback so far, so we assume no duplicates. Therefore, ""RUMOR"" would have two R's -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""ARMOR"" -> A excluded and duplicate R.

Another word: ""FJORD"" -> F excluded.

So ""HUMOR"" seems a good candidate.

But let me check if there are words for the other case? We have to consider both.

Another word for case 2: ""VAPOR"" -> A excluded.

""MAJOR"" -> A excluded.

""LABOR"" -> L excluded.

""SUGAR"" -> S excluded.

So ""HUMOR"" is a good candidate.

But note: in ""HUMOR"", we have:
  H in position 1 (new letter)
  U in position 2 (new position for U, which we haven't tested at position 2)
  M in position 3 (new letter)
  O in position 4 (which is a new position for O, and we haven't tested O in position 4 before)
  R in position 5 (correct)

We also test H and M, which are new.

But we are not testing other vowels? We have U and O, and we know the word has these.

Alternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we have only two positions that are not fixed? Actually, we have three positions that are unknown: 1,2,3? But in ""HUMOR"", we are testing H, U, M in positions 1,2,3.

But we have to make a guess that fits the constraints.

Another possibility: if we don't guess ""HUMOR"", we might guess a word that has O in position 1? But we haven't found a common word.

What about ""ODORR""? Not a word and duplicate.

""OUZEL"" -> E? excluded.

I think ""HUMOR"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm the feedback we would get if ""HUMOR"" is the secret word? But we don't know, we are just guessing.

We are at guess 4, so we can try.

But note: we have another constraint. In the third guess ""flour"", we had U in position 4 and got a minus. Now in ""HUMOR"", U is in position 2. So if the secret word is ""HUMOR"", then the feedback for ""flour"" was correct: U is in the word but not in position 4 (it's in 2), and O is in the word but not in position 3 (it's in 4). So it fits.

Therefore, I will go with ""HUMOR"".

But wait: we have to consider if there are other possibilities. For example, O could be in position 1? But we couldn't find a word. Let me try again.

Word: ""OUNCE"" -> E excluded.

""OUTER"" -> E excluded.

""OILER"" -> E? excluded? E is excluded. Also, I and L? L is excluded? L is excluded from ""flour"" feedback: L got x. So L is not in the word. So ""OILER"" has L -> invalid.

""OAKER"" -> A excluded.

""OUBIT"" -> not a word.

So I think ""HUMOR"" is the best choice.

Therefore, the fourth guess is ""HUMOR"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E, P, T, S, F, L (all marked with ""x"").
- **Included letters**:
  - R is in the word and correctly placed in position 5 (✓ from ""flour"").
  - O is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""ports"") or position 3 (from ""flour"").
  - U is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""flour"").
- **Position constraints**:
  - R must be in position 5.
  - O can only be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are invalid).
  - U can be in position 1, 2, or 3 (since position 4 is invalid).
- The secret word must contain O and U, along with R, and two additional letters from the unused set (B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

For the fourth guess, I chose ""HUMOR"" because:
- It places R in position 5 (correct, as confirmed).
- It tests O in position 4 (a valid position) and U in position 2 (a valid position).
- It introduces new common letters H and M, which haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids all excluded letters and adheres to the position constraints.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word that fits the known criteria.

<guess>humor</guess>",humor,"We have feedback from the third guess ""flour"":
  F: x (not in the word)
  L: x (not in the word)
  O: - (in the word but wrong position)
  U: - (in the word but wrong position)
  R: ✓ (correct position)

So, we now know:
- R is in the word and in position 5 (since we got a check for R in position 5 of ""flour"").
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (because we got a minus for O in position 3).
- U is in the word but not in position 4 (because we got a minus for U in position 4).
- F and L are not in the word.

Additionally, from previous guesses:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, P, T, S, F, L.
- Included letters: R (position 5 fixed), O, U.

We also have position constraints for O and U:
- O cannot be in position 2 (from ""ports"") and now also cannot be in position 3 (from ""flour"").
- U cannot be in position 4 (from ""flour"").

Moreover, R is fixed at position 5.

So the secret word has:
  _ _ _ _ R

And we know the word contains O and U, but not in the positions we've tried.

Possible positions for O: Since O cannot be in position 2 or 3, it can only be in position 1 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter, and we have U that also cannot be in position 4? Let me list:

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (with 5 being R)

Constraints:
- O: cannot be in 2 or 3 -> so O can be in 1 or 4.
- U: cannot be in 4 -> so U can be in 1, 2, or 3.

But note: if O is in position 4, then U cannot be in position 4, which is already satisfied. Also, we cannot have two letters in the same position, so O and U must be in different positions.

Moreover, we have three positions to fill (1,2,3) and two known letters (O and U) and one unknown letter? Actually, the word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 5 is R. So positions 1,2,3,4 must contain O, U, and two other letters? But we know the word has O and U, and we don't know about other letters.

Actually, we know the word has at least O, U, and R. There might be more letters? But we have only identified three letters so far: O, U, R. So we need two more letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, P, T, S, F, L.

Available letters: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use O, U, R but they are already in the word? We don't know if they are repeated. But we haven't seen any indication of duplicates, so we assume no duplicates for now.)

Therefore, we need two new letters for positions 1,2,3,4? Actually, positions 1,2,3,4 must be filled with O, U, and two other letters (since R is at 5).

But note: O and U must be placed in two of the positions 1,2,3,4, but with constraints:
- O: only positions 1 or 4 (because 2 and 3 are forbidden for O)
- U: positions 1,2,3 (but not 4)

However, if O is in position 4, then U cannot be in position 4 (which is already satisfied) and can be in 1,2,3. But if O is in position 1, then U can be in 2 or 3 (since 4 is forbidden for U? No, U is forbidden in 4, but 4 is available for other letters? Actually, U can be in 1,2,3, so if O is in 1, then U cannot be in 1 (duplicate? but we assume no duplicates) so U must be in 2 or 3.

Similarly, if O is in position 4, then U must be in 1,2, or 3.

Now, we also have to fill the remaining two positions with two new letters.

We need to form a word that fits.

Let me consider the two cases:

Case 1: O in position 1
  Then the word: O _ _ _ R
  U must be in position 2 or 3 (since position 4 is forbidden for U? Actually, U can be in 2 or 3, but not 4? Yes, from feedback U not in 4. And position 1 is taken by O, so U cannot be there. So U in 2 or 3.
  Then the remaining positions (if U in 2: then positions 3 and 4 are two new letters; if U in 3: then positions 2 and 4 are two new letters).

Case 2: O in position 4
  Then the word: _ _ _ O R
  U must be in position 1,2, or 3 (but not 4, which is taken by O). So U in 1,2, or 3, and the remaining two positions are the other two new letters.

We need to choose a word that tests these possibilities and uses common letters.

But note: we have only 6 tries and we are at guess 4. We want to maximize information.

We also know that the word must be valid.

Let me think of words that end with R and have O and U.

First, if O is in position 4: then the word is _ _ _ O R

Examples:
- ""M U R O R"" -> but duplicate R? and we have R at the end. Also, U in position 2? But we don't know. Also, M and U are available. But ""MUROr"" is not a word? Actually, ""muro"" is not English. 

- ""D U C O R"" -> C excluded -> invalid.

- ""G U I O R"" -> not a word.

- ""H U M O R"" -> H(1), U(2), M(3), O(4), R(5). This is a valid word. And we have U in position 2 -> allowed? We don't have any constraint that U cannot be in position 2? Only that U cannot be in position 4 (which is satisfied). Also, O in position 4 -> allowed? But wait, in this word, O is in position 4, which is the fourth position. And we have R in position 5. The letters: H, U, M, O, R. None excluded? H, U, M are not excluded. So ""HUMOR"" is a candidate.

Now, if O is in position 1: then O _ _ _ R

Examples:
- ""O U _ _ R"" -> but U in position 2? Then we have ""OU_ _ R"". Words: ""OUNCE"" -> E excluded. ""OUIJA"" -> A excluded. ""POUR"" -> only 4 letters? Not 5.

- ""O _ U _ R"": for example, ""O D U R A"" -> A excluded. ""O K U R A"" -> not a word.

- ""O _ _ U R"": for example, ""O P E U R"" -> P and E excluded. ""O M B U R"" -> B? and U in position 4? But U cannot be in position 4? From feedback, U is not in position 4. So we cannot put U in position 4. Therefore, in this case, if O is in position 1, U must be in position 2 or 3, not 4.

So for ""O _ _ U R"" is invalid because U would be in position 4? Actually, in ""O _ _ U R"", U is in position 4 -> which is forbidden. So we cannot have that.

Therefore, for case 1 (O in 1), U must be in 2 or 3, and the other positions are new letters.

But we found ""HUMOR"" which fits case 2.

Are there other words? For example, ""RUMOR"" -> but R is at the beginning? We have R at the end. ""RUMOR"" has R at position 1 and 5? But we have R fixed at position 5, so if we have R at position 1, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We haven't encountered any duplicate feedback so far, so we assume no duplicates. Therefore, ""RUMOR"" would have two R's -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""ARMOR"" -> A excluded and duplicate R.

Another word: ""FJORD"" -> F excluded.

So ""HUMOR"" seems a good candidate.

But let me check if there are words for the other case? We have to consider both.

Another word for case 2: ""VAPOR"" -> A excluded.

""MAJOR"" -> A excluded.

""LABOR"" -> L excluded.

""SUGAR"" -> S excluded.

So ""HUMOR"" is a good candidate.

But note: in ""HUMOR"", we have:
  H in position 1 (new letter)
  U in position 2 (new position for U, which we haven't tested at position 2)
  M in position 3 (new letter)
  O in position 4 (which is a new position for O, and we haven't tested O in position 4 before)
  R in position 5 (correct)

We also test H and M, which are new.

But we are not testing other vowels? We have U and O, and we know the word has these.

Alternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we have only two positions that are not fixed? Actually, we have three positions that are unknown: 1,2,3? But in ""HUMOR"", we are testing H, U, M in positions 1,2,3.

But we have to make a guess that fits the constraints.

Another possibility: if we don't guess ""HUMOR"", we might guess a word that has O in position 1? But we haven't found a common word.

What about ""ODORR""? Not a word and duplicate.

""OUZEL"" -> E? excluded.

I think ""HUMOR"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm the feedback we would get if ""HUMOR"" is the secret word? But we don't know, we are just guessing.

We are at guess 4, so we can try.

But note: we have another constraint. In the third guess ""flour"", we had U in position 4 and got a minus. Now in ""HUMOR"", U is in position 2. So if the secret word is ""HUMOR"", then the feedback for ""flour"" was correct: U is in the word but not in position 4 (it's in 2), and O is in the word but not in position 3 (it's in 4). So it fits.

Therefore, I will go with ""HUMOR"".

But wait: we have to consider if there are other possibilities. For example, O could be in position 1? But we couldn't find a word. Let me try again.

Word: ""OUNCE"" -> E excluded.

""OUTER"" -> E excluded.

""OILER"" -> E? excluded? E is excluded. Also, I and L? L is excluded? L is excluded from ""flour"" feedback: L got x. So L is not in the word. So ""OILER"" has L -> invalid.

""OAKER"" -> A excluded.

""OUBIT"" -> not a word.

So I think ""HUMOR"" is the best choice.

Therefore, the fourth guess is ""HUMOR"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, E, P, T, S, F, L (all marked with ""x"").
- **Included letters**:
  - R is in the word and correctly placed in position 5 (✓ from ""flour"").
  - O is in the word but not in position 2 (from ""ports"") or position 3 (from ""flour"").
  - U is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""flour"").
- **Position constraints**:
  - R must be in position 5.
  - O can only be in position 1 or 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are invalid).
  - U can be in position 1, 2, or 3 (since position 4 is invalid).
- The secret word must contain O and U, along with R, and two additional letters from the unused set (B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

For the fourth guess, I chose ""HUMOR"" because:
- It places R in position 5 (correct, as confirmed).
- It tests O in position 4 (a valid position) and U in position 2 (a valid position).
- It introduces new common letters H and M, which haven't been tested yet.
- It avoids all excluded letters and adheres to the position constraints.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word that fits the known criteria.",Guess 4: humor -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) U(✓) M(✓) O(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
