We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: '-'  -> The letter C is in the secret word but not in the first position.
 R: 'x'  -> The letter R is not in the secret word.
 A: '✓' -> The letter A is in the secret word and in the correct position (second position? wait, let's note positions).
    Note: In the word ""crane"", the positions are:
        Position 1: C
        Position 2: R  -> but R is marked as not in the word? That contradicts if A is in the correct position.

 Let me clarify the positions for ""crane"":
    1: C
    2: R
    3: A
    4: N
    5: E

 The feedback says:
    C is in the word but not in position 1 -> so C must be in the word, but in a different position.
    R is not in the word -> so we know R is absent.
    A is in the word and in the correct position. Since A was in position 3, the secret word has A at position 3.
    N is not in the word -> absent.
    E is not in the word -> absent.

 Therefore, we know:
    The secret word has the letter C (but not at position 1) and the letter A at position 3.
    The secret word does not contain R, N, or E.

 Since A is at position 3, we can represent the secret word as: _ _ A _ _

 And we know the word must contain the letter C (somewhere except position 1) and cannot contain R, N, E.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters.

 Possible positions for C: positions 2, 4, or 5 (since position 1 is ruled out by the feedback).

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
    - Has A at position 3.
    - Contains the letter C (but not at position 1).
    - Does not contain R, N, E.
    - And it must be a valid English word.

 We want to test other letters to get more information. Since we have eliminated R, N, E, we can try including other common consonants and vowels.

 The vowels we've used so far: A (fixed), and we know E is not present. So remaining vowels might include I, O, U, and sometimes Y. But vowels could be limited.

 Let me think of words that have A in the third position and start with a letter that we haven't eliminated.

 Consider: 
    The first position: cannot be R, N, E, and we don't know yet. It must be a letter that is not R, N, E, and not C? But wait, C is allowed elsewhere but not at first? Actually, we know C is in the word but not at position 1, so position 1 must be a letter that is not C and not the eliminated letters.

 Possible words:

 Let me try to form a word with A being in the third position and including C in either position 2,4, or 5.

 Example: 
    Position 1: not R, N, E, and not C (since C isn't at pos1). And we don't know what it is. We can choose a common consonant.
    Position 2: cannot be R? But R is eliminated. So must be from the remaining alphabet. Also, since we need to place C somewhere, let's try putting C at position 4 or 5.

 Let me try words:
    ""CHASM"": 
        C at position 1? -> but position 1: C -> but that's position 1 and we know C cannot be at position 1 from feedback? 
        Wait, in our feedback: C was in position 1 and marked as '-' meaning present in word but not position 1. So C must appear somewhere else. In ""CHASM"", C is at 1 again -> not allowed? Actually, we can guess words that have C again? But the feedback wouldn't mark it as present again? The rules: the feedback might show multiple symbols for repeated letters? But in the example, they didn't show repeated letters. We need to be cautious.

 Let me recall the rules: 
    Each letter is marked independently. So if the secret word has one C and we guess two, then one of them might be marked correctly and the other might be marked as not present? Or if the secret word has two of the same letter? However, we don't know if the secret word has multiple C's.

 But note: In our feedback, C was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one C. If we guess a word with two C's, then the feedback for each occurrence would be separate.

 However, we know the secret word has one C (but we don't know) ... actually, we don't know if it has more. But to start, let's assume only one C until we see evidence.

 So we have to avoid putting C at position 1 again because we know it's not there.

 Trying words with A at position 3 and C elsewhere.

 Possibilities:
    The word must have exactly 5 letters, with A at position 3.

 Let me try: 
    Position 3: A fixed.
    Position 1: let it be a new consonant, say B (since E is eliminated, but B is allowed).
    Position 2: ... but then we need C somewhere. If I put B at 1, then what about position 2? Maybe we put another letter? Then put C at 4.

 Example: ""BALMY""? 
   But look at positions: 
        B A L M Y -> 
        Position 1: B
        Position 2: A -> but we need A at position 3. This word has A at position 2. 
        So that doesn't work.

 We need A at position 3.

 Example words with A at position 3: 
    ...CA? but C is not at the beginning? Actually, we can have:

 Let me list some words:
    BASIC: positions -> 1:B, 2:A -> A is at 2, not 3 -> no.
    FLAKY: 1:F, 2:L, 3:A -> good. Then 4: K, 5: Y.
        Does it have C? No. And we need to include C? Actually, we don't have to include C in this guess? 
        Why? Because we are trying to get more information. We know the word has C, but we can choose a word that doesn't have C to test other letters? 
        However, that might not be efficient. We want to confirm the position of C.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that:
    - Has A at position 3.
    - Contains C in one of the positions 2,4,5? But note: position 2 is open and we haven't eliminated L? etc.

 However, we must note: the feedback said R is absent, so we cannot use R. Similarly N and E are absent.

 Considering the constraints:

    Positions:
        1: not C, not R, not N, not E
        2: not R, not N, not E -> must be a letter from remaining, and also cannot be A? Because A is fixed at 3? But position 2 can be any letter as long as it's not eliminated.
        3: A (fixed)
        4: not N, not E, not R -> and if we choose a word with C at 4, that's okay.
        5: same as above.

 Example word: ""PLACK"" -> not a valid word? Let me think.

    Valid words: 
        ""CLAMP"" -> but wait, C is at position 1 -> we cannot use C at pos1? We can, but the feedback will tell us that C is present elsewhere? However, we are allowed to guess any word. But we know that C isn't at pos1 so why put it there again? It's inefficient because we will get a '-' for that C again? Or if the word has two C's? But we don't know.

    Alternatively, we can avoid using C at position1. 

    Possible words: 
        ""HAVOC"": 
            H A V O C -> 
            position 1: H -> okay, not eliminated.
            position 2: A -> but we need A at position 3. -> no.
        ""BACON"": 
            B A C O N -> 
            position 1: B
            position 2: A -> not position 3 -> no.
        ""TRACK"": 
            T R A C K -> 
            position 3: A -> good.
            But we have R at position 2 -> R is eliminated -> so we cannot use R -> invalid because we know R is not in the word.

    We need a word without R, N, E.

    Another idea: ""CHAIS"" -> not a word. 

    Consider ""SCALY"": 
        S C A L Y -> positions: 
            1: S -> okay? 
            2: C -> good, we are putting C in a new position (position2) to test if it's there?
            3: A -> fits.
            4: L -> okay.
            5: Y -> okay.
        This word avoids eliminated letters: no R, N, E.

        But wait, in the first guess we had C at position1 and it was marked as present but in the wrong position. So if the secret word has C at position2, then in the first guess we would have seen that C is present but not at1? But we don't know where it is. 

        This word ""SCALY"" has C at position2. So we can try this? 

    However, note: the feedback for the first guess said the secret word has C but not at position1. And we are considering position2 for C. Also, note that in ""SCALY"", the letter Y is tested.

    But let me check the letter S: we don't know anything about S yet. And L and Y haven't been tested.

    Alternatively, we can try another word that includes C at a different position? Maybe position4.

    Word with C at position4: ""BLACK"": 
        B L A C K -> 
        position 1: B -> okay
        position 2: L -> okay
        position 3: A -> okay
        position 4: C -> okay
        position 5: K -> okay
        It doesn't contain R, N, E -> valid.

    But ""BLACK"" is a valid word? Yes.

    Another option: ""CLACK"" -> but C at position1 again -> not ideal because we already know that position1 isn't C.

    So I think ""BLACK"" is a good candidate.

    However, note: we are not forced to include the known C in the second guess. But if we don't include C and we get feedback without C, we won't learn where C is. So it's better to include C to get more information about it.

    Let me compare:

        Option 1: Guess ""SCALY"":
            If the secret word has C at position2, then we might get:
                Position1: S -> if S is in the word? -> might be marked as ✓ or - or x.
                Position2: C -> if the secret word has C at position2, then ✓. Otherwise, only if it's present elsewhere might be - (but we know C is in the word so we expect at least one C to appear in the feedback).

        Option 2: Guess ""BLACK"" (or ""PLACK"" which is not a word, so not).

        Also, note: we know the secret word has A at position3 and C somewhere (not1). So if we guess ""BLACK"", we are putting C at position4.

    I think both ""SCALY"" and ""BLACK"" are valid. But let me think about maximizing information:

        We want to test as many new letters as possible.

        In ""SCALY"", letters: S, C, A, L, Y -> but A is already known and fixed at position3, and C is known to be in the word so we are only testing S, L, Y.

        In ""BLACK"", letters: B, L, A, C, K -> similarly, testing B, L, K and C (which we know) and A fixed.

        Both words have three new letters (if we count A and C as known). 

        We haven't tested S, B, L, K, Y.

        I think ""BLACK"" might be a better choice because we are placing C at position4 so if we get a ✓ for C there we know it's correct. If we get a '-' then we know C is at position5? Or if we get an 'x' that would be contradictory because we know C is in the word? So for C we must not get an 'x'. So if we put C at position4 and get '-' then C must be at position5. Similarly if we put it at position5 and get '-' then it must be position4? But wait, we have only two positions left: 4 and 5? Actually, positions 2,4,5 are possible? But in ""BLACK"", we are testing position4.

    However, note: in our second guess, if we put C at a position and it's marked ✓, then we've found the position.

    So I choose ""BLACK"".

    But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that A is at position3. In both words A is at position3, so we are safe.

    However, we must also avoid using eliminated letters: R, N, E.

    ""BLACK"": contains no R, N, E -> valid.

    So my guess will be ""BLACK"".

    Alternatively, to cover more vowels? But we know E is absent. The vowels we haven't tested: O, I, U? 

    But ""BLACK"" has A which is already known and a vowel? So we are not testing new vowels.

    We might test a word containing O or I? 

    Example: ""CLOAK"" -> but position1 is C -> which we know is not at position1 -> inefficient? 

    Another: ""BALDY"" -> but D? Also ""Y"" at end. But what about letter D? 

    Actually, we want to use common letters to maximize information.

    Common consonants: T, L, S, etc. We used L in both ""SCALY"" and ""BLACK"".

    Consider ""SALTY"": 
        Positions: 1:S, 2:A -> wait, A is at position2 but we need A at position3 -> no.

    We need A at position3.

    A word like ""PASTA"": 
        1: P, 2: A -> no, A at position2 -> not position3.

    Another word: ""ABACK"" -> A at position1? then B, A at position3? Actually:
        A B A C K -> 
        position1: A -> but we haven't tested A at position1? 
        position2: B
        position3: A -> fixed, so ✓
        position4: C
        position5: K
        But we have two A's? We don't know if the secret word has multiple A's.

        Also, we know A is at position3, but we don't know if it appears elsewhere. So the secret word might have other A's.

        However, the feedback for the first guess: the A was at position3 and marked ✓ so we know there's an A at position3. If there are more A's, then in the first guess we didn't have them so they didn't show up.

        Also, in ""ABACK"", we have A at position1 -> which hasn't been tested. But we don't know about A being used elsewhere.

        However, we are allowed to guess words with letters multiple times.

        But ""ABACK"": 
            Contains A at position1 and A at position3.
            And we know the secret word has A at position3 so that A is safe. Now, what about the A at position1? It might be present or not? 
            We also have C at position4.

        The problem: doesn't the feedback mark each letter? So the first A (position1) would be evaluated: if the secret word has A at position1 then ✓, else if it has A elsewhere then -, else x. But we know the secret word has A at position3 (already) but it might not have A at position1. So we might get:
            Position1: A -> if the secret word doesn't have A at position1 but has an extra A, then it would be marked as '-' (because it would be in the word but in the wrong position). Otherwise x? 

        Actually, the feedback rules: 
            The letter is marked independently. So if the secret word has two A's: then one A might be matched at position3 (✓) and the other A might be matched at position1 if present? But at position1 we have A so if the secret word has an A at position1 then ✓, else if they have an extra A somewhere else then we might get '-'? But note: the secret word's A at position3 is already matched? Then the extra A at position1 would only be marked as present (with '-') if there is indeed another A? 

        Since we know there's at least one A (at position3) and we are guessing A at position1, then if there's another A in the word, we'll get '-' for that A at position1. Otherwise x.

        This might be too convoluted for the second guess? 

        So sticking to words without duplicate letters might be easier? 

        Since ""BLACK"" has distinct letters: B, L, A, C, K -> no duplicates -> good.

    I decide to guess ""BLACK"".

    But wait: we know the secret word has C and we are putting it at position4. If position4 is the correct spot, we get ✓ and that is solved.

    We get feedback for ""BLACK"": 
        position1: B -> ?
        position2: L -> ?
        position3: A -> ✓ (because it's fixed by the first guess)
        position4: C -> we hope to get ✓ but we might get '-' if C is at position5? Or if there is another position? 
        position5: K -> ?

    But if C is at position5, then the feedback for C at position4 would be '-'? Because the C is in the word but not at position4? But the secret word only has one C? Actually, we don't know if it has more.

    So let me generate:

        If the secret word has C at position2? Then in ""BLACK"" the C at position4 would be an extra? Actually, no: 
            The secret word: let C be at position2 and the word is ... but we know position3 is A -> so secret word: ? C A ? ?
            But we don't know the word. Example: ""SCARE"" -> but S is not tested? Also, R is eliminated -> not.

        Actually, we have eliminated R so position2 cannot be R. And we are only considering position2,4,5 for C.

    Given the constraints, we are testing position4 and position5 for C? Because position2 is still possible? We haven't tested position2.

    So if we guess ""SCALY"", we test C at position2.

    But ""BLACK"" doesn't test position2? So we still don't know about position2? 

    Actually, we can design a word that tests C in multiple positions? No, because we are limited to one C in the guess? 

    Alternatively, to test position2 we would have to put C at position2. 

    Therefore, to maximize information about C, we might choose a word with C at a position we haven't tried: position2,4, or5.

    Since we tried position1 in the first guess, now avoid position1? Let's try position2? 

    Candidate word: ""SCALP"" (if we don't mind testing S and L and P)? 
        But we need to avoid eliminated letters: no R, N, E -> valid.

    However, ""SCALP"": 
        S at pos1, C at pos2, A at pos3, L at pos4, P at pos5.

        This tests C at position2.

    Similarly, we can test position5 by choosing a word that ends with C? There are fewer words ending in C? 

    Example: ""MANIC"" -> M A N I C -> N is eliminated -> invalid.

    Another: ""TOPIC"" -> T O P I C -> O? I? But we don't know.

    So I think the most common position for C might be at the beginning? But we already know it's not position1? Then position4? Like in ""BLACK"".

    Actually, let me think of two words: 
        ""BLACK"" (C at position4) vs ""SCALY"" (C at position2)

    Both are valid and test a new position for C.

    I'll go with ""BLACK"" because it has common letters B, L, K? And the word is well known.

    Final decision: BLACK.

    We'll see what the feedback says.

    But note: in the feedback, we know that position3 must be fixed as A, so:

        For ""BLACK"": 
            We expect position3 to be ✓: A(✓).
            Then we will get feedback for the other letters.

    So let's guess: ""BLACK""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is in the word and correctly placed in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

I deduce that:
- The secret word has exactly 5 letters.
- Position 3 is A (fixed).
- The letter C must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 1).
- The letters R, N, and E are absent.
- The secret word structure is: `_ _ A _ _`.

For this guess, I choose ""black"" because:
- It has A in position 3 (matching the fixed position).
- It places C in position 4 (a new position to test).
- The letters B, L, and K are new and common consonants that can help gather more information.
- It avoids R, N, E, and any duplicate letters to simplify feedback analysis.

<guess>black</guess>",black,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: '-'  -> The letter C is in the secret word but not in the first position.
 R: 'x'  -> The letter R is not in the secret word.
 A: '✓' -> The letter A is in the secret word and in the correct position (second position? wait, let's note positions).
    Note: In the word ""crane"", the positions are:
        Position 1: C
        Position 2: R  -> but R is marked as not in the word? That contradicts if A is in the correct position.

 Let me clarify the positions for ""crane"":
    1: C
    2: R
    3: A
    4: N
    5: E

 The feedback says:
    C is in the word but not in position 1 -> so C must be in the word, but in a different position.
    R is not in the word -> so we know R is absent.
    A is in the word and in the correct position. Since A was in position 3, the secret word has A at position 3.
    N is not in the word -> absent.
    E is not in the word -> absent.

 Therefore, we know:
    The secret word has the letter C (but not at position 1) and the letter A at position 3.
    The secret word does not contain R, N, or E.

 Since A is at position 3, we can represent the secret word as: _ _ A _ _

 And we know the word must contain the letter C (somewhere except position 1) and cannot contain R, N, E.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters.

 Possible positions for C: positions 2, 4, or 5 (since position 1 is ruled out by the feedback).

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
    - Has A at position 3.
    - Contains the letter C (but not at position 1).
    - Does not contain R, N, E.
    - And it must be a valid English word.

 We want to test other letters to get more information. Since we have eliminated R, N, E, we can try including other common consonants and vowels.

 The vowels we've used so far: A (fixed), and we know E is not present. So remaining vowels might include I, O, U, and sometimes Y. But vowels could be limited.

 Let me think of words that have A in the third position and start with a letter that we haven't eliminated.

 Consider: 
    The first position: cannot be R, N, E, and we don't know yet. It must be a letter that is not R, N, E, and not C? But wait, C is allowed elsewhere but not at first? Actually, we know C is in the word but not at position 1, so position 1 must be a letter that is not C and not the eliminated letters.

 Possible words:

 Let me try to form a word with A being in the third position and including C in either position 2,4, or 5.

 Example: 
    Position 1: not R, N, E, and not C (since C isn't at pos1). And we don't know what it is. We can choose a common consonant.
    Position 2: cannot be R? But R is eliminated. So must be from the remaining alphabet. Also, since we need to place C somewhere, let's try putting C at position 4 or 5.

 Let me try words:
    ""CHASM"": 
        C at position 1? -> but position 1: C -> but that's position 1 and we know C cannot be at position 1 from feedback? 
        Wait, in our feedback: C was in position 1 and marked as '-' meaning present in word but not position 1. So C must appear somewhere else. In ""CHASM"", C is at 1 again -> not allowed? Actually, we can guess words that have C again? But the feedback wouldn't mark it as present again? The rules: the feedback might show multiple symbols for repeated letters? But in the example, they didn't show repeated letters. We need to be cautious.

 Let me recall the rules: 
    Each letter is marked independently. So if the secret word has one C and we guess two, then one of them might be marked correctly and the other might be marked as not present? Or if the secret word has two of the same letter? However, we don't know if the secret word has multiple C's.

 But note: In our feedback, C was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one C. If we guess a word with two C's, then the feedback for each occurrence would be separate.

 However, we know the secret word has one C (but we don't know) ... actually, we don't know if it has more. But to start, let's assume only one C until we see evidence.

 So we have to avoid putting C at position 1 again because we know it's not there.

 Trying words with A at position 3 and C elsewhere.

 Possibilities:
    The word must have exactly 5 letters, with A at position 3.

 Let me try: 
    Position 3: A fixed.
    Position 1: let it be a new consonant, say B (since E is eliminated, but B is allowed).
    Position 2: ... but then we need C somewhere. If I put B at 1, then what about position 2? Maybe we put another letter? Then put C at 4.

 Example: ""BALMY""? 
   But look at positions: 
        B A L M Y -> 
        Position 1: B
        Position 2: A -> but we need A at position 3. This word has A at position 2. 
        So that doesn't work.

 We need A at position 3.

 Example words with A at position 3: 
    ...CA? but C is not at the beginning? Actually, we can have:

 Let me list some words:
    BASIC: positions -> 1:B, 2:A -> A is at 2, not 3 -> no.
    FLAKY: 1:F, 2:L, 3:A -> good. Then 4: K, 5: Y.
        Does it have C? No. And we need to include C? Actually, we don't have to include C in this guess? 
        Why? Because we are trying to get more information. We know the word has C, but we can choose a word that doesn't have C to test other letters? 
        However, that might not be efficient. We want to confirm the position of C.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that:
    - Has A at position 3.
    - Contains C in one of the positions 2,4,5? But note: position 2 is open and we haven't eliminated L? etc.

 However, we must note: the feedback said R is absent, so we cannot use R. Similarly N and E are absent.

 Considering the constraints:

    Positions:
        1: not C, not R, not N, not E
        2: not R, not N, not E -> must be a letter from remaining, and also cannot be A? Because A is fixed at 3? But position 2 can be any letter as long as it's not eliminated.
        3: A (fixed)
        4: not N, not E, not R -> and if we choose a word with C at 4, that's okay.
        5: same as above.

 Example word: ""PLACK"" -> not a valid word? Let me think.

    Valid words: 
        ""CLAMP"" -> but wait, C is at position 1 -> we cannot use C at pos1? We can, but the feedback will tell us that C is present elsewhere? However, we are allowed to guess any word. But we know that C isn't at pos1 so why put it there again? It's inefficient because we will get a '-' for that C again? Or if the word has two C's? But we don't know.

    Alternatively, we can avoid using C at position1. 

    Possible words: 
        ""HAVOC"": 
            H A V O C -> 
            position 1: H -> okay, not eliminated.
            position 2: A -> but we need A at position 3. -> no.
        ""BACON"": 
            B A C O N -> 
            position 1: B
            position 2: A -> not position 3 -> no.
        ""TRACK"": 
            T R A C K -> 
            position 3: A -> good.
            But we have R at position 2 -> R is eliminated -> so we cannot use R -> invalid because we know R is not in the word.

    We need a word without R, N, E.

    Another idea: ""CHAIS"" -> not a word. 

    Consider ""SCALY"": 
        S C A L Y -> positions: 
            1: S -> okay? 
            2: C -> good, we are putting C in a new position (position2) to test if it's there?
            3: A -> fits.
            4: L -> okay.
            5: Y -> okay.
        This word avoids eliminated letters: no R, N, E.

        But wait, in the first guess we had C at position1 and it was marked as present but in the wrong position. So if the secret word has C at position2, then in the first guess we would have seen that C is present but not at1? But we don't know where it is. 

        This word ""SCALY"" has C at position2. So we can try this? 

    However, note: the feedback for the first guess said the secret word has C but not at position1. And we are considering position2 for C. Also, note that in ""SCALY"", the letter Y is tested.

    But let me check the letter S: we don't know anything about S yet. And L and Y haven't been tested.

    Alternatively, we can try another word that includes C at a different position? Maybe position4.

    Word with C at position4: ""BLACK"": 
        B L A C K -> 
        position 1: B -> okay
        position 2: L -> okay
        position 3: A -> okay
        position 4: C -> okay
        position 5: K -> okay
        It doesn't contain R, N, E -> valid.

    But ""BLACK"" is a valid word? Yes.

    Another option: ""CLACK"" -> but C at position1 again -> not ideal because we already know that position1 isn't C.

    So I think ""BLACK"" is a good candidate.

    However, note: we are not forced to include the known C in the second guess. But if we don't include C and we get feedback without C, we won't learn where C is. So it's better to include C to get more information about it.

    Let me compare:

        Option 1: Guess ""SCALY"":
            If the secret word has C at position2, then we might get:
                Position1: S -> if S is in the word? -> might be marked as ✓ or - or x.
                Position2: C -> if the secret word has C at position2, then ✓. Otherwise, only if it's present elsewhere might be - (but we know C is in the word so we expect at least one C to appear in the feedback).

        Option 2: Guess ""BLACK"" (or ""PLACK"" which is not a word, so not).

        Also, note: we know the secret word has A at position3 and C somewhere (not1). So if we guess ""BLACK"", we are putting C at position4.

    I think both ""SCALY"" and ""BLACK"" are valid. But let me think about maximizing information:

        We want to test as many new letters as possible.

        In ""SCALY"", letters: S, C, A, L, Y -> but A is already known and fixed at position3, and C is known to be in the word so we are only testing S, L, Y.

        In ""BLACK"", letters: B, L, A, C, K -> similarly, testing B, L, K and C (which we know) and A fixed.

        Both words have three new letters (if we count A and C as known). 

        We haven't tested S, B, L, K, Y.

        I think ""BLACK"" might be a better choice because we are placing C at position4 so if we get a ✓ for C there we know it's correct. If we get a '-' then we know C is at position5? Or if we get an 'x' that would be contradictory because we know C is in the word? So for C we must not get an 'x'. So if we put C at position4 and get '-' then C must be at position5. Similarly if we put it at position5 and get '-' then it must be position4? But wait, we have only two positions left: 4 and 5? Actually, positions 2,4,5 are possible? But in ""BLACK"", we are testing position4.

    However, note: in our second guess, if we put C at a position and it's marked ✓, then we've found the position.

    So I choose ""BLACK"".

    But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that A is at position3. In both words A is at position3, so we are safe.

    However, we must also avoid using eliminated letters: R, N, E.

    ""BLACK"": contains no R, N, E -> valid.

    So my guess will be ""BLACK"".

    Alternatively, to cover more vowels? But we know E is absent. The vowels we haven't tested: O, I, U? 

    But ""BLACK"" has A which is already known and a vowel? So we are not testing new vowels.

    We might test a word containing O or I? 

    Example: ""CLOAK"" -> but position1 is C -> which we know is not at position1 -> inefficient? 

    Another: ""BALDY"" -> but D? Also ""Y"" at end. But what about letter D? 

    Actually, we want to use common letters to maximize information.

    Common consonants: T, L, S, etc. We used L in both ""SCALY"" and ""BLACK"".

    Consider ""SALTY"": 
        Positions: 1:S, 2:A -> wait, A is at position2 but we need A at position3 -> no.

    We need A at position3.

    A word like ""PASTA"": 
        1: P, 2: A -> no, A at position2 -> not position3.

    Another word: ""ABACK"" -> A at position1? then B, A at position3? Actually:
        A B A C K -> 
        position1: A -> but we haven't tested A at position1? 
        position2: B
        position3: A -> fixed, so ✓
        position4: C
        position5: K
        But we have two A's? We don't know if the secret word has multiple A's.

        Also, we know A is at position3, but we don't know if it appears elsewhere. So the secret word might have other A's.

        However, the feedback for the first guess: the A was at position3 and marked ✓ so we know there's an A at position3. If there are more A's, then in the first guess we didn't have them so they didn't show up.

        Also, in ""ABACK"", we have A at position1 -> which hasn't been tested. But we don't know about A being used elsewhere.

        However, we are allowed to guess words with letters multiple times.

        But ""ABACK"": 
            Contains A at position1 and A at position3.
            And we know the secret word has A at position3 so that A is safe. Now, what about the A at position1? It might be present or not? 
            We also have C at position4.

        The problem: doesn't the feedback mark each letter? So the first A (position1) would be evaluated: if the secret word has A at position1 then ✓, else if it has A elsewhere then -, else x. But we know the secret word has A at position3 (already) but it might not have A at position1. So we might get:
            Position1: A -> if the secret word doesn't have A at position1 but has an extra A, then it would be marked as '-' (because it would be in the word but in the wrong position). Otherwise x? 

        Actually, the feedback rules: 
            The letter is marked independently. So if the secret word has two A's: then one A might be matched at position3 (✓) and the other A might be matched at position1 if present? But at position1 we have A so if the secret word has an A at position1 then ✓, else if they have an extra A somewhere else then we might get '-'? But note: the secret word's A at position3 is already matched? Then the extra A at position1 would only be marked as present (with '-') if there is indeed another A? 

        Since we know there's at least one A (at position3) and we are guessing A at position1, then if there's another A in the word, we'll get '-' for that A at position1. Otherwise x.

        This might be too convoluted for the second guess? 

        So sticking to words without duplicate letters might be easier? 

        Since ""BLACK"" has distinct letters: B, L, A, C, K -> no duplicates -> good.

    I decide to guess ""BLACK"".

    But wait: we know the secret word has C and we are putting it at position4. If position4 is the correct spot, we get ✓ and that is solved.

    We get feedback for ""BLACK"": 
        position1: B -> ?
        position2: L -> ?
        position3: A -> ✓ (because it's fixed by the first guess)
        position4: C -> we hope to get ✓ but we might get '-' if C is at position5? Or if there is another position? 
        position5: K -> ?

    But if C is at position5, then the feedback for C at position4 would be '-'? Because the C is in the word but not at position4? But the secret word only has one C? Actually, we don't know if it has more.

    So let me generate:

        If the secret word has C at position2? Then in ""BLACK"" the C at position4 would be an extra? Actually, no: 
            The secret word: let C be at position2 and the word is ... but we know position3 is A -> so secret word: ? C A ? ?
            But we don't know the word. Example: ""SCARE"" -> but S is not tested? Also, R is eliminated -> not.

        Actually, we have eliminated R so position2 cannot be R. And we are only considering position2,4,5 for C.

    Given the constraints, we are testing position4 and position5 for C? Because position2 is still possible? We haven't tested position2.

    So if we guess ""SCALY"", we test C at position2.

    But ""BLACK"" doesn't test position2? So we still don't know about position2? 

    Actually, we can design a word that tests C in multiple positions? No, because we are limited to one C in the guess? 

    Alternatively, to test position2 we would have to put C at position2. 

    Therefore, to maximize information about C, we might choose a word with C at a position we haven't tried: position2,4, or5.

    Since we tried position1 in the first guess, now avoid position1? Let's try position2? 

    Candidate word: ""SCALP"" (if we don't mind testing S and L and P)? 
        But we need to avoid eliminated letters: no R, N, E -> valid.

    However, ""SCALP"": 
        S at pos1, C at pos2, A at pos3, L at pos4, P at pos5.

        This tests C at position2.

    Similarly, we can test position5 by choosing a word that ends with C? There are fewer words ending in C? 

    Example: ""MANIC"" -> M A N I C -> N is eliminated -> invalid.

    Another: ""TOPIC"" -> T O P I C -> O? I? But we don't know.

    So I think the most common position for C might be at the beginning? But we already know it's not position1? Then position4? Like in ""BLACK"".

    Actually, let me think of two words: 
        ""BLACK"" (C at position4) vs ""SCALY"" (C at position2)

    Both are valid and test a new position for C.

    I'll go with ""BLACK"" because it has common letters B, L, K? And the word is well known.

    Final decision: BLACK.

    We'll see what the feedback says.

    But note: in the feedback, we know that position3 must be fixed as A, so:

        For ""BLACK"": 
            We expect position3 to be ✓: A(✓).
            Then we will get feedback for the other letters.

    So let's guess: ""BLACK""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is in the word and correctly placed in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

I deduce that:
- The secret word has exactly 5 letters.
- Position 3 is A (fixed).
- The letter C must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 1).
- The letters R, N, and E are absent.
- The secret word structure is: `_ _ A _ _`.

For this guess, I choose ""black"" because:
- It has A in position 3 (matching the fixed position).
- It places C in position 4 (a new position to test).
- The letters B, L, and K are new and common consonants that can help gather more information.
- It avoids R, N, E, and any duplicate letters to simplify feedback analysis.",Guess 2: black -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) A(✓) C(✓) K(✓),FAIL

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: '-'  -> The letter C is in the secret word but not in the first position.
 R: 'x'  -> The letter R is not in the secret word.
 A: '✓' -> The letter A is in the secret word and in the correct position (second position? wait, let's note positions).
    Note: In the word ""crane"", the positions are:
        Position 1: C
        Position 2: R  -> but R is marked as not in the word? That contradicts if A is in the correct position.

 Let me clarify the positions for ""crane"":
    1: C
    2: R
    3: A
    4: N
    5: E

 The feedback says:
    C is in the word but not in position 1 -> so C must be in the word, but in a different position.
    R is not in the word -> so we know R is absent.
    A is in the word and in the correct position. Since A was in position 3, the secret word has A at position 3.
    N is not in the word -> absent.
    E is not in the word -> absent.

 Therefore, we know:
    The secret word has the letter C (but not at position 1) and the letter A at position 3.
    The secret word does not contain R, N, or E.

 Since A is at position 3, we can represent the secret word as: _ _ A _ _

 And we know the word must contain the letter C (somewhere except position 1) and cannot contain R, N, E.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters.

 Possible positions for C: positions 2, 4, or 5 (since position 1 is ruled out by the feedback).

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
    - Has A at position 3.
    - Contains the letter C (but not at position 1).
    - Does not contain R, N, E.
    - And it must be a valid English word.

 We want to test other letters to get more information. Since we have eliminated R, N, E, we can try including other common consonants and vowels.

 The vowels we've used so far: A (fixed), and we know E is not present. So remaining vowels might include I, O, U, and sometimes Y. But vowels could be limited.

 Let me think of words that have A in the third position and start with a letter that we haven't eliminated.

 Consider: 
    The first position: cannot be R, N, E, and we don't know yet. It must be a letter that is not R, N, E, and not C? But wait, C is allowed elsewhere but not at first? Actually, we know C is in the word but not at position 1, so position 1 must be a letter that is not C and not the eliminated letters.

 Possible words:

 Let me try to form a word with A being in the third position and including C in either position 2,4, or 5.

 Example: 
    Position 1: not R, N, E, and not C (since C isn't at pos1). And we don't know what it is. We can choose a common consonant.
    Position 2: cannot be R? But R is eliminated. So must be from the remaining alphabet. Also, since we need to place C somewhere, let's try putting C at position 4 or 5.

 Let me try words:
    ""CHASM"": 
        C at position 1? -> but position 1: C -> but that's position 1 and we know C cannot be at position 1 from feedback? 
        Wait, in our feedback: C was in position 1 and marked as '-' meaning present in word but not position 1. So C must appear somewhere else. In ""CHASM"", C is at 1 again -> not allowed? Actually, we can guess words that have C again? But the feedback wouldn't mark it as present again? The rules: the feedback might show multiple symbols for repeated letters? But in the example, they didn't show repeated letters. We need to be cautious.

 Let me recall the rules: 
    Each letter is marked independently. So if the secret word has one C and we guess two, then one of them might be marked correctly and the other might be marked as not present? Or if the secret word has two of the same letter? However, we don't know if the secret word has multiple C's.

 But note: In our feedback, C was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one C. If we guess a word with two C's, then the feedback for each occurrence would be separate.

 However, we know the secret word has one C (but we don't know) ... actually, we don't know if it has more. But to start, let's assume only one C until we see evidence.

 So we have to avoid putting C at position 1 again because we know it's not there.

 Trying words with A at position 3 and C elsewhere.

 Possibilities:
    The word must have exactly 5 letters, with A at position 3.

 Let me try: 
    Position 3: A fixed.
    Position 1: let it be a new consonant, say B (since E is eliminated, but B is allowed).
    Position 2: ... but then we need C somewhere. If I put B at 1, then what about position 2? Maybe we put another letter? Then put C at 4.

 Example: ""BALMY""? 
   But look at positions: 
        B A L M Y -> 
        Position 1: B
        Position 2: A -> but we need A at position 3. This word has A at position 2. 
        So that doesn't work.

 We need A at position 3.

 Example words with A at position 3: 
    ...CA? but C is not at the beginning? Actually, we can have:

 Let me list some words:
    BASIC: positions -> 1:B, 2:A -> A is at 2, not 3 -> no.
    FLAKY: 1:F, 2:L, 3:A -> good. Then 4: K, 5: Y.
        Does it have C? No. And we need to include C? Actually, we don't have to include C in this guess? 
        Why? Because we are trying to get more information. We know the word has C, but we can choose a word that doesn't have C to test other letters? 
        However, that might not be efficient. We want to confirm the position of C.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that:
    - Has A at position 3.
    - Contains C in one of the positions 2,4,5? But note: position 2 is open and we haven't eliminated L? etc.

 However, we must note: the feedback said R is absent, so we cannot use R. Similarly N and E are absent.

 Considering the constraints:

    Positions:
        1: not C, not R, not N, not E
        2: not R, not N, not E -> must be a letter from remaining, and also cannot be A? Because A is fixed at 3? But position 2 can be any letter as long as it's not eliminated.
        3: A (fixed)
        4: not N, not E, not R -> and if we choose a word with C at 4, that's okay.
        5: same as above.

 Example word: ""PLACK"" -> not a valid word? Let me think.

    Valid words: 
        ""CLAMP"" -> but wait, C is at position 1 -> we cannot use C at pos1? We can, but the feedback will tell us that C is present elsewhere? However, we are allowed to guess any word. But we know that C isn't at pos1 so why put it there again? It's inefficient because we will get a '-' for that C again? Or if the word has two C's? But we don't know.

    Alternatively, we can avoid using C at position1. 

    Possible words: 
        ""HAVOC"": 
            H A V O C -> 
            position 1: H -> okay, not eliminated.
            position 2: A -> but we need A at position 3. -> no.
        ""BACON"": 
            B A C O N -> 
            position 1: B
            position 2: A -> not position 3 -> no.
        ""TRACK"": 
            T R A C K -> 
            position 3: A -> good.
            But we have R at position 2 -> R is eliminated -> so we cannot use R -> invalid because we know R is not in the word.

    We need a word without R, N, E.

    Another idea: ""CHAIS"" -> not a word. 

    Consider ""SCALY"": 
        S C A L Y -> positions: 
            1: S -> okay? 
            2: C -> good, we are putting C in a new position (position2) to test if it's there?
            3: A -> fits.
            4: L -> okay.
            5: Y -> okay.
        This word avoids eliminated letters: no R, N, E.

        But wait, in the first guess we had C at position1 and it was marked as present but in the wrong position. So if the secret word has C at position2, then in the first guess we would have seen that C is present but not at1? But we don't know where it is. 

        This word ""SCALY"" has C at position2. So we can try this? 

    However, note: the feedback for the first guess said the secret word has C but not at position1. And we are considering position2 for C. Also, note that in ""SCALY"", the letter Y is tested.

    But let me check the letter S: we don't know anything about S yet. And L and Y haven't been tested.

    Alternatively, we can try another word that includes C at a different position? Maybe position4.

    Word with C at position4: ""BLACK"": 
        B L A C K -> 
        position 1: B -> okay
        position 2: L -> okay
        position 3: A -> okay
        position 4: C -> okay
        position 5: K -> okay
        It doesn't contain R, N, E -> valid.

    But ""BLACK"" is a valid word? Yes.

    Another option: ""CLACK"" -> but C at position1 again -> not ideal because we already know that position1 isn't C.

    So I think ""BLACK"" is a good candidate.

    However, note: we are not forced to include the known C in the second guess. But if we don't include C and we get feedback without C, we won't learn where C is. So it's better to include C to get more information about it.

    Let me compare:

        Option 1: Guess ""SCALY"":
            If the secret word has C at position2, then we might get:
                Position1: S -> if S is in the word? -> might be marked as ✓ or - or x.
                Position2: C -> if the secret word has C at position2, then ✓. Otherwise, only if it's present elsewhere might be - (but we know C is in the word so we expect at least one C to appear in the feedback).

        Option 2: Guess ""BLACK"" (or ""PLACK"" which is not a word, so not).

        Also, note: we know the secret word has A at position3 and C somewhere (not1). So if we guess ""BLACK"", we are putting C at position4.

    I think both ""SCALY"" and ""BLACK"" are valid. But let me think about maximizing information:

        We want to test as many new letters as possible.

        In ""SCALY"", letters: S, C, A, L, Y -> but A is already known and fixed at position3, and C is known to be in the word so we are only testing S, L, Y.

        In ""BLACK"", letters: B, L, A, C, K -> similarly, testing B, L, K and C (which we know) and A fixed.

        Both words have three new letters (if we count A and C as known). 

        We haven't tested S, B, L, K, Y.

        I think ""BLACK"" might be a better choice because we are placing C at position4 so if we get a ✓ for C there we know it's correct. If we get a '-' then we know C is at position5? Or if we get an 'x' that would be contradictory because we know C is in the word? So for C we must not get an 'x'. So if we put C at position4 and get '-' then C must be at position5. Similarly if we put it at position5 and get '-' then it must be position4? But wait, we have only two positions left: 4 and 5? Actually, positions 2,4,5 are possible? But in ""BLACK"", we are testing position4.

    However, note: in our second guess, if we put C at a position and it's marked ✓, then we've found the position.

    So I choose ""BLACK"".

    But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that A is at position3. In both words A is at position3, so we are safe.

    However, we must also avoid using eliminated letters: R, N, E.

    ""BLACK"": contains no R, N, E -> valid.

    So my guess will be ""BLACK"".

    Alternatively, to cover more vowels? But we know E is absent. The vowels we haven't tested: O, I, U? 

    But ""BLACK"" has A which is already known and a vowel? So we are not testing new vowels.

    We might test a word containing O or I? 

    Example: ""CLOAK"" -> but position1 is C -> which we know is not at position1 -> inefficient? 

    Another: ""BALDY"" -> but D? Also ""Y"" at end. But what about letter D? 

    Actually, we want to use common letters to maximize information.

    Common consonants: T, L, S, etc. We used L in both ""SCALY"" and ""BLACK"".

    Consider ""SALTY"": 
        Positions: 1:S, 2:A -> wait, A is at position2 but we need A at position3 -> no.

    We need A at position3.

    A word like ""PASTA"": 
        1: P, 2: A -> no, A at position2 -> not position3.

    Another word: ""ABACK"" -> A at position1? then B, A at position3? Actually:
        A B A C K -> 
        position1: A -> but we haven't tested A at position1? 
        position2: B
        position3: A -> fixed, so ✓
        position4: C
        position5: K
        But we have two A's? We don't know if the secret word has multiple A's.

        Also, we know A is at position3, but we don't know if it appears elsewhere. So the secret word might have other A's.

        However, the feedback for the first guess: the A was at position3 and marked ✓ so we know there's an A at position3. If there are more A's, then in the first guess we didn't have them so they didn't show up.

        Also, in ""ABACK"", we have A at position1 -> which hasn't been tested. But we don't know about A being used elsewhere.

        However, we are allowed to guess words with letters multiple times.

        But ""ABACK"": 
            Contains A at position1 and A at position3.
            And we know the secret word has A at position3 so that A is safe. Now, what about the A at position1? It might be present or not? 
            We also have C at position4.

        The problem: doesn't the feedback mark each letter? So the first A (position1) would be evaluated: if the secret word has A at position1 then ✓, else if it has A elsewhere then -, else x. But we know the secret word has A at position3 (already) but it might not have A at position1. So we might get:
            Position1: A -> if the secret word doesn't have A at position1 but has an extra A, then it would be marked as '-' (because it would be in the word but in the wrong position). Otherwise x? 

        Actually, the feedback rules: 
            The letter is marked independently. So if the secret word has two A's: then one A might be matched at position3 (✓) and the other A might be matched at position1 if present? But at position1 we have A so if the secret word has an A at position1 then ✓, else if they have an extra A somewhere else then we might get '-'? But note: the secret word's A at position3 is already matched? Then the extra A at position1 would only be marked as present (with '-') if there is indeed another A? 

        Since we know there's at least one A (at position3) and we are guessing A at position1, then if there's another A in the word, we'll get '-' for that A at position1. Otherwise x.

        This might be too convoluted for the second guess? 

        So sticking to words without duplicate letters might be easier? 

        Since ""BLACK"" has distinct letters: B, L, A, C, K -> no duplicates -> good.

    I decide to guess ""BLACK"".

    But wait: we know the secret word has C and we are putting it at position4. If position4 is the correct spot, we get ✓ and that is solved.

    We get feedback for ""BLACK"": 
        position1: B -> ?
        position2: L -> ?
        position3: A -> ✓ (because it's fixed by the first guess)
        position4: C -> we hope to get ✓ but we might get '-' if C is at position5? Or if there is another position? 
        position5: K -> ?

    But if C is at position5, then the feedback for C at position4 would be '-'? Because the C is in the word but not at position4? But the secret word only has one C? Actually, we don't know if it has more.

    So let me generate:

        If the secret word has C at position2? Then in ""BLACK"" the C at position4 would be an extra? Actually, no: 
            The secret word: let C be at position2 and the word is ... but we know position3 is A -> so secret word: ? C A ? ?
            But we don't know the word. Example: ""SCARE"" -> but S is not tested? Also, R is eliminated -> not.

        Actually, we have eliminated R so position2 cannot be R. And we are only considering position2,4,5 for C.

    Given the constraints, we are testing position4 and position5 for C? Because position2 is still possible? We haven't tested position2.

    So if we guess ""SCALY"", we test C at position2.

    But ""BLACK"" doesn't test position2? So we still don't know about position2? 

    Actually, we can design a word that tests C in multiple positions? No, because we are limited to one C in the guess? 

    Alternatively, to test position2 we would have to put C at position2. 

    Therefore, to maximize information about C, we might choose a word with C at a position we haven't tried: position2,4, or5.

    Since we tried position1 in the first guess, now avoid position1? Let's try position2? 

    Candidate word: ""SCALP"" (if we don't mind testing S and L and P)? 
        But we need to avoid eliminated letters: no R, N, E -> valid.

    However, ""SCALP"": 
        S at pos1, C at pos2, A at pos3, L at pos4, P at pos5.

        This tests C at position2.

    Similarly, we can test position5 by choosing a word that ends with C? There are fewer words ending in C? 

    Example: ""MANIC"" -> M A N I C -> N is eliminated -> invalid.

    Another: ""TOPIC"" -> T O P I C -> O? I? But we don't know.

    So I think the most common position for C might be at the beginning? But we already know it's not position1? Then position4? Like in ""BLACK"".

    Actually, let me think of two words: 
        ""BLACK"" (C at position4) vs ""SCALY"" (C at position2)

    Both are valid and test a new position for C.

    I'll go with ""BLACK"" because it has common letters B, L, K? And the word is well known.

    Final decision: BLACK.

    We'll see what the feedback says.

    But note: in the feedback, we know that position3 must be fixed as A, so:

        For ""BLACK"": 
            We expect position3 to be ✓: A(✓).
            Then we will get feedback for the other letters.

    So let's guess: ""BLACK""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- A is in the word and correctly placed in position 3.
- N is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

I deduce that:
- The secret word has exactly 5 letters.
- Position 3 is A (fixed).
- The letter C must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 1).
- The letters R, N, and E are absent.
- The secret word structure is: `_ _ A _ _`.

For this guess, I choose ""black"" because:
- It has A in position 3 (matching the fixed position).
- It places C in position 4 (a new position to test).
- The letters B, L, and K are new and common consonants that can help gather more information.
- It avoids R, N, E, and any duplicate letters to simplify feedback analysis.

But we don\'t know.\n\n    Alternatively, we can avoid using C at position1. \n\n    Possible words: \n        ""HAVOC"": \n            H A V O C -> \n            position 1: H -> okay, not eliminated.\n            position 2: A -> but we need A at position 3. -> no.\n        ""BACON"": \n            B A C O N -> \n            position 1: B\n            position 2: A -> not position 3 -> no.\n        ""TRACK"": \n            T R A C K -> \n            position 3: A -> good.\n            But we have R at position 2 -> R is eliminated -> so we cannot use R -> invalid because we know R is not in the word.\n\n    We need a word without R, N, E.\n\n    Another idea: ""CHAIS"" -> not a word. \n\n    Consider ""SCALY"": \n        S C A L Y -> positions: \n            1: S -> okay? \n            2: C -> good, we are putting C in a new position (position2) to test if it\'s there?\n            3: A -> fits.\n            4: L -> okay.\n            5: Y -> okay.\n        This word avoids eliminated letters: no R, N, E.\n\n        But wait, in the first guess we had C at position1 and it was marked as present but in the wrong position. So if the secret word has C at position2, then in the first guess we would have seen that C is present but not at1? But we don\'t know where it is. \n\n        This word ""SCALY"" has C at position2. So we can try this? \n\n    However, note: the feedback for the first guess said the secret word has C but not at position1. And we are considering position2 for C. Also, note that in ""SCALY"", the letter Y is tested.\n\n    But let me check the letter S: we don\'t know anything about S yet. And L and Y haven\'t been tested.\n\n    Alternatively, we can try another word that includes C at a different position? Maybe position4.\n\n    Word with C at position4: ""BLACK"": \n        B L A C K -> \n        position 1: B -> okay\n        position 2: L -> okay\n        position 3: A -> okay\n        position 4: C -> okay\n        position 5: K -> okay\n        It doesn\'t contain R, N, E -> valid.\n\n    But ""BLACK"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n    Another option: ""CLACK"" -> but C at position1 again -> not ideal because we already know that position1 isn\'t C.\n\n    So I think ""BLACK"" is a good candidate.\n\n    However, note: we are not forced to include the known C in the second guess. But if we don\'t include C and we get feedback without C, we won\'t learn where C is. So it\'s better to include C to get more information about it.\n\n    Let me compare:\n\n        Option 1: Guess ""SCALY"":\n            If the secret word has C at position2, then we might get:\n                Position1: S -> if S is in the word? -> might be marked as ✓ or - or x.\n                Position2: C -> if the secret word has C at position2, then ✓. Otherwise, only if it\'s present elsewhere might be - (but we know C is in the word so we expect at least one C to appear in the feedback).\n\n        Option 2: Guess ""BLACK"" (or ""PLACK"" which is not a word, so not).\n\n        Also, note: we know the secret word has A at position3 and C somewhere (not1). So if we guess ""BLACK"", we are putting C at position4.\n\n    I think both ""SCALY"" and ""BLACK"" are valid. But let me think about maximizing information:\n\n        We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n        In ""SCALY"", letters: S, C, A, L, Y -> but A is already known and fixed at position3, and C is known to be in the word so we are only testing S, L, Y.\n\n        In ""BLACK"", letters: B, L, A, C, K -> similarly, testing B, L, K and C (which we know) and A fixed.\n\n        Both words have three new letters (if we count A and C as known). \n\n        We haven\'t tested S, B, L, K, Y.\n\n        I think ""BLACK"" might be a better choice because we are placing C at position4 so if we get a ✓ for C there we know it\'s correct. If we get a \'-\' then we know C is at position5? Or if we get an \'x\' that would be contradictory because we know C is in the word? So for C we must not get an \'x\'. So if we put C at position4 and get \'-\' then C must be at position5. Similarly if we put it at position5 and get \'-\' then it must be position4? But wait, we have only two positions left: 4 and 5? Actually, positions 2,4,5 are possible? But in ""BLACK"", we are testing position4.\n\n    However, note: in our second guess, if we put C at a position and it\'s marked ✓, then we\'ve found the position.\n\n    So I choose ""BLACK"".\n\n    But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that A is at position3. In both words A is at position3, so we are safe.\n\n    However, we must also avoid using eliminated letters: R, N, E.\n\n    ""BLACK"": contains no R, N, E -> valid.\n\n    So my guess will be ""BLACK"".\n\n    Alternatively, to cover more vowels? But we know E is absent. The vowels we haven\'t tested: O, I, U? \n\n    But ""BLACK"" has A which is already known and a vowel? So we are not testing new vowels.\n\n    We might test a word containing O or I? \n\n    Example: ""CLOAK"" -> but position1 is C -> which we know is not at position1 -> inefficient? \n\n    Another: ""BALDY"" -> but D? Also ""Y"" at end. But what about letter D? \n\n    Actually, we want to use common letters to maximize information.\n\n    Common consonants: T, L, S, etc. We used L in both ""SCALY"" and ""BLACK"".\n\n    Consider ""SALTY"": \n        Positions: 1:S, 2:A -> wait, A is at position2 but we need A at position3 -> no.\n\n    We need A at position3.\n\n    A word like ""PASTA"": \n        1: P, 2: A -> no, A at position2 -> not position3.\n\n    Another word: ""ABACK"" -> A at position1? then B, A at position3? Actually:\n        A B A C K -> \n        position1: A -> but we haven\'t tested A at position1? \n        position2: B\n        position3: A -> fixed, so ✓\n        position4: C\n        position5: K\n        But we have two A\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has multiple A\'s.\n\n        Also, we know A is at position3, but we don\'t know if it appears elsewhere. So the secret word might have other A\'s.\n\n        However, the feedback for the first guess: the A was at position3 and marked ✓ so we know there\'s an A at position3. If there are more A\'s, then in the first guess we didn\'t have them so they didn\'t show up.\n\n        Also, in ""ABACK"", we have A at position1 -> which hasn\'t been tested. But we don\'t know about A being used elsewhere.\n\n        However, we are allowed to guess words with letters multiple times.\n\n        But ""ABACK"": \n            Contains A at position1 and A at position3.\n            And we know the secret word has A at position3 so that A is safe. Now, what about the A at position1? It might be present or not? \n            We also have C at position4.\n\n        The problem: doesn\'t the feedback mark each letter? So the first A (position1) would be evaluated: if the secret word has A at position1 then ✓, else if it has A elsewhere then -, else x. But we know the secret word has A at position3 (already) but it might not have A at position1. So we might get:\n            Position1: A -> if the secret word doesn\'t have A at position1 but has an extra A, then it would be marked as \'-\' (because it would be in the word but in the wrong position). Otherwise x? \n\n        Actually, the feedback rules: \n            The letter is marked independently. So if the secret word has two A\'s: then one A might be matched at position3 (✓) and the other A might be matched at position1 if present? But at position1 we have A so if the secret word has an A at position1 then ✓, else if they have an extra A somewhere else then we might get \'-\'? But note: the secret word\'s A at position3 is already matched? Then the extra A at position1 would only be marked as present (with \'-\') if there is indeed another A? \n\n        Since we know there\'s at least one A (at position3) and we are guessing A at position1, then if there\'s another A in the word, we\'ll get \'-\' for that A at position1. Otherwise x.\n\n        This might be too convoluted for the second guess? \n\n        So sticking to words without duplicate letters might be easier? \n\n        Since ""BLACK"" has distinct letters: B, L, A, C, K -> no duplicates -> good.\n\n    I decide to guess ""BLACK"".\n\n    But wait: we know the secret word has C and we are putting it at position4. If position4 is the correct spot, we get ✓ and that is solved.\n\n    We get feedback for ""BLACK"": \n        position1: B -> ?\n        position2: L -> ?\n        position3: A -> ✓ (because it\'s fixed by the first guess)\n        position4: C -> we hope to get ✓ but we might get \'-\' if C is at position5? Or if there is another position? \n        position5: K -> ?\n\n    But if C is at position5, then the feedback for C at position4 would be \'-\'? Because the C is in the word but not at position4? But the secret word only has one C? Actually, we don\'t know if it has more.\n\n    So let me generate:\n\n        If the secret word has C at position2? Then in ""BLACK"" the C at position4 would be an extra? Actually, no: \n            The secret word: let C be at position2 and the word is ... but we know position3 is A -> so secret word: ? C A ? ?\n            But we don\'t know the word. Example: ""SCARE"" -> but S is not tested? Also, R is eliminated -> not.\n\n        Actually, we have eliminated R so position2 cannot be R. And we are only considering position2,4,5 for C.\n\n    Given the constraints, we are testing position4 and position5 for C? Because position2 is still possible? We haven\'t tested position2.\n\n    So if we guess ""SCALY"", we test C at position2.\n\n    But ""BLACK"" doesn\'t test position2? So we still don\'t know about position2? \n\n    Actually, we can design a word that tests C in multiple positions? No, because we are limited to one C in the guess? \n\n    Alternatively, to test position2 we would have to put C at position2. \n\n    Therefore, to maximize information about C, we might choose a word with C at a position we haven\'t tried: position2,4, or5.\n\n    Since we tried position1 in the first guess, now avoid position1? Let\'s try position2? \n\n    Candidate word: ""SCALP"" (if we don\'t mind testing S and L and P)? \n        But we need to avoid eliminated letters: no R, N, E -> valid.\n\n    However, ""SCALP"": \n        S at pos1, C at pos2, A at pos3, L at pos4, P at pos5.\n\n        This tests C at position2.\n\n    Similarly, we can test position5 by choosing a word that ends with C? There are fewer words ending in C? \n\n    Example: ""MANIC"" -> M A N I C -> N is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n    Another: ""TOPIC"" -> T O P I C -> O? I? But we don\'t know.\n\n    So I think the most common position for C might be at the beginning? But we already know it\'s not position1? Then position4? Like in ""BLACK"".\n\n    Actually, let me think of two words: \n        ""BLACK"" (C at position4) vs ""SCALY"" (C at position2)\n\n    Both are valid and test a new position for C.\n\n    I\'ll go with ""BLACK"" because it has common letters B, L, K? And the word is well known.\n\n    Final decision: BLACK.\n\n    We\'ll see what the feedback says.\n\n    But note: in the feedback, we know that position3 must be fixed as A, so:\n\n        For ""BLACK"": \n            We expect position3 to be ✓: A(✓).\n            Then we will get feedback for the other letters.\n\n    So let\'s guess: ""BLACK""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is in the secret word but not in position 1.\n- R is not in the word.\n- A is in the word and correctly placed in position 3.\n- N is not in the word.\n- E is not in the word.\n\nI deduce that:\n- The secret word has exactly 5 letters.\n- Position 3 is A (fixed).\n- The letter C must appear in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it\'s not in position 1).\n- The letters R, N, and E are absent.\n- The secret word structure is: `_ _ A _ _`.\n\nFor this guess, I choose ""black"" because:\n- It has A in position 3 (matching the fixed position).\n- It places C in position 4 (a new position to test).\n- The letters B, L, and K are new and common consonants that can help gather more information.\n- It avoids R, N, E, and any duplicate letters to simplify feedback analysis.\n\n<guess>black</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: black -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(✓) A(✓) C(✓) K(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the second guess ""black"":
 B: 'x' -> The letter B is not in the secret word.
 L: '✓' -> The letter L is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
 A: '✓' -> The letter A is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 3). We already knew this.
 C: '✓' -> The letter C is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 4).
 K: '✓' -> The letter K is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).

 From the feedback, we know:
   Position 2: L (fixed)
   Position 3: A (fixed)
   Position 4: C (fixed)
   Position 5: K (fixed)

 And we know that the secret word does not contain B (from the 'x' for B in position 1).

 Also, from the first guess, we know that the secret word does not contain R, N, E.

 Now, the secret word structure is: _ L A C K

 We only need to find the first letter.

 Constraints for the first letter:
   - It must be a letter that is not in the eliminated list: R, N, E, B (and also not L, A, C, K because they are already placed and we assume no duplicates? But note: we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but in the feedback we haven't seen any duplicates so far. However, we must be cautious).

 However, note the feedback for the first guess: 
   ""crane"" had C at position1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now we have C at position4 and it's correct. So the secret word has only one C? Because if it had two C's, then the first guess might have shown two marks? But the feedback only showed one mark for C (a '-'). Similarly, in the second guess, we have C at position4 and it's marked correct, and we don't have any other C. So it's safe to assume the secret word has exactly one C.

 Similarly, for A: we have it at position3 and it was correct in both guesses. We don't have any other A in the guesses, so we don't know if there are more. But in the first guess, we only had one A and it was marked correct. So if there were another A, we might have seen a '-' for it? Actually, in the first guess, we only had one A and it was at the correct position. So if the secret word had another A, we wouldn't know because we didn't test it. However, in the second guess, we only have one A (at position3) and it's correct. So we don't have information about other A's.

 But for the first letter, we are going to put a letter that is not A, L, C, K? Because we are going to test a new letter.

 However, the secret word structure is fixed for positions 2-5: L, A, C, K.

 So the secret word is: ? L A C K

 We need to find the first letter. It must be a letter that:
   - Is not in the eliminated letters: R, N, E, B.
   - And it must form a valid English word.

 Possible letters: any letter except R, N, E, B, and also we must avoid L, A, C, K? But wait, the secret word might have duplicate letters? 

 However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far. And the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate marks. So let's assume no duplicates for now. Then the first letter must be a letter that is not R, N, E, B, L, A, C, K.

 But note: the first guess had C and it was present, and now we have C at position4. So the first letter cannot be C? We already know that. Similarly, we have L, A, K at positions 2,3,5. So the first letter must be a new letter.

 Let me list the remaining letters: 
   Alphabet minus R, N, E, B, L, A, C, K.

 That leaves: D, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to form a word: _ L A C K

 Common words that end with ""LACK"":
   BLACK -> but we know B is eliminated -> not.
   CLACK -> but C is at position1? and we know C is at position4 -> and we have eliminated C at position1? Also, we have two C's? But we are assuming no duplicates? And also, we know B is eliminated so we can't use B. 
   FLACK: F L A C K -> F is not eliminated? 
   SLACK: S L A C K -> S is not eliminated.

 So possible words: FLACK, SLACK, and maybe others? 

 But note: we have to use a word that is valid and we can test the first letter.

 However, we don't need to test the entire word again? We know positions 2-5 are fixed. So we can just try to guess the first letter.

 But we have two possibilities: F and S? And maybe others? 

 Let me check: 
   FLACK: a valid word (meaning: to promote or publicize).
   SLACK: a valid word (meaning: loose, not tight; or to be lazy).

 Also, are there others?
   PLACK: not a common word? (I think not, so we skip)
   ALACK: interjection, but starts with A -> but we already have A at position3? And we are avoiding duplicates? Also, A is already used? But if we allow duplicates, then ALACK would have two A's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

 However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any duplicate letters. So let's assume no duplicates. Then the first letter cannot be A (because we have A at position3). Similarly, it cannot be L, C, K.

 So the only common words are FLACK and SLACK.

 How to choose? We can try one of them.

 But note: we have not tested F or S in any previous guess. So we don't know about them.

 We can choose either. Let's choose SLACK because it's a very common word.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more letters? But we don't have to because we only have one position left. We can just try one of the possibilities.

 However, we have 6 tries and we are on the third guess. We can try SLACK. If it's not correct, then we know the first letter must be F? 

 So let's try SLACK.

 But wait: what if there are more than two possibilities? 
   Other words: 
      WLACK? -> not a word.
      VLACK? -> not.
      ... so only FLACK and SLACK? 

 Actually, I can think of:
      CLACK: but C is already at position4 -> duplicate? and we are avoiding duplicates? Also, we know C is at position4 and we are putting C at position1? But we know from the first guess that C is not at position1. So CLACK is invalid because it has C at position1 which we know is wrong.

   So only FLACK and SLACK.

 Therefore, we can try SLACK.

 If the feedback for SLACK:
   Position1: S -> if it's correct, then we get ✓. If not, then we get x? But if it's x, then the secret word must be FLACK.

 So we can solve it in at most two more guesses.

 But we are on the third guess, so we can try SLACK.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has both S and F? But we don't have any other positions to test? Because positions 2-5 are fixed. So we cannot test two letters at once? 

 Therefore, we must guess one of the two.

 I choose SLACK because it's more common.

 So the guess is ""SLACK"".

 But note: we are not forced to use the fixed positions? We could use a different word? But why? We know the last four letters are LACK. So we must use that.

 Therefore, we guess ""SLACK"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C is present but not in position 1, R is absent, A is correct in position 3, N and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""black"")**: B is absent, L is correct in position 2, A is correct in position 3, C is correct in position 4, K is correct in position 5.

### Deductions:
1. The secret word structure is: **`_ L A C K`** (positions 2–5 are confirmed).
2. The missing first letter must:
   - **Be absent** from the eliminated letters: **B, R, N, E** (from feedback).
   - **Not be** L, A, C, or K (since these are confirmed in positions 2–5, and no duplicates have been indicated in feedback).
3. Possible first letters: **F, S** (common letters that form valid words: **FLACK** or **SLACK**).

### Strategy:
- Test **""SLACK""** as the next guess. It is a common word and will confirm if **S** is the first letter. If incorrect, the solution must be **FLACK** (solved in the next guess).

<guess>slack</guess>",slack,"We are given feedback for the second guess ""black"":
 B: 'x' -> The letter B is not in the secret word.
 L: '✓' -> The letter L is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
 A: '✓' -> The letter A is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 3). We already knew this.
 C: '✓' -> The letter C is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 4).
 K: '✓' -> The letter K is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).

 From the feedback, we know:
   Position 2: L (fixed)
   Position 3: A (fixed)
   Position 4: C (fixed)
   Position 5: K (fixed)

 And we know that the secret word does not contain B (from the 'x' for B in position 1).

 Also, from the first guess, we know that the secret word does not contain R, N, E.

 Now, the secret word structure is: _ L A C K

 We only need to find the first letter.

 Constraints for the first letter:
   - It must be a letter that is not in the eliminated list: R, N, E, B (and also not L, A, C, K because they are already placed and we assume no duplicates? But note: we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but in the feedback we haven't seen any duplicates so far. However, we must be cautious).

 However, note the feedback for the first guess: 
   ""crane"" had C at position1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now we have C at position4 and it's correct. So the secret word has only one C? Because if it had two C's, then the first guess might have shown two marks? But the feedback only showed one mark for C (a '-'). Similarly, in the second guess, we have C at position4 and it's marked correct, and we don't have any other C. So it's safe to assume the secret word has exactly one C.

 Similarly, for A: we have it at position3 and it was correct in both guesses. We don't have any other A in the guesses, so we don't know if there are more. But in the first guess, we only had one A and it was marked correct. So if there were another A, we might have seen a '-' for it? Actually, in the first guess, we only had one A and it was at the correct position. So if the secret word had another A, we wouldn't know because we didn't test it. However, in the second guess, we only have one A (at position3) and it's correct. So we don't have information about other A's.

 But for the first letter, we are going to put a letter that is not A, L, C, K? Because we are going to test a new letter.

 However, the secret word structure is fixed for positions 2-5: L, A, C, K.

 So the secret word is: ? L A C K

 We need to find the first letter. It must be a letter that:
   - Is not in the eliminated letters: R, N, E, B.
   - And it must form a valid English word.

 Possible letters: any letter except R, N, E, B, and also we must avoid L, A, C, K? But wait, the secret word might have duplicate letters? 

 However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far. And the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate marks. So let's assume no duplicates for now. Then the first letter must be a letter that is not R, N, E, B, L, A, C, K.

 But note: the first guess had C and it was present, and now we have C at position4. So the first letter cannot be C? We already know that. Similarly, we have L, A, K at positions 2,3,5. So the first letter must be a new letter.

 Let me list the remaining letters: 
   Alphabet minus R, N, E, B, L, A, C, K.

 That leaves: D, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to form a word: _ L A C K

 Common words that end with ""LACK"":
   BLACK -> but we know B is eliminated -> not.
   CLACK -> but C is at position1? and we know C is at position4 -> and we have eliminated C at position1? Also, we have two C's? But we are assuming no duplicates? And also, we know B is eliminated so we can't use B. 
   FLACK: F L A C K -> F is not eliminated? 
   SLACK: S L A C K -> S is not eliminated.

 So possible words: FLACK, SLACK, and maybe others? 

 But note: we have to use a word that is valid and we can test the first letter.

 However, we don't need to test the entire word again? We know positions 2-5 are fixed. So we can just try to guess the first letter.

 But we have two possibilities: F and S? And maybe others? 

 Let me check: 
   FLACK: a valid word (meaning: to promote or publicize).
   SLACK: a valid word (meaning: loose, not tight; or to be lazy).

 Also, are there others?
   PLACK: not a common word? (I think not, so we skip)
   ALACK: interjection, but starts with A -> but we already have A at position3? And we are avoiding duplicates? Also, A is already used? But if we allow duplicates, then ALACK would have two A's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

 However, in the feedback so far, we haven't seen any duplicate letters. So let's assume no duplicates. Then the first letter cannot be A (because we have A at position3). Similarly, it cannot be L, C, K.

 So the only common words are FLACK and SLACK.

 How to choose? We can try one of them.

 But note: we have not tested F or S in any previous guess. So we don't know about them.

 We can choose either. Let's choose SLACK because it's a very common word.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more letters? But we don't have to because we only have one position left. We can just try one of the possibilities.

 However, we have 6 tries and we are on the third guess. We can try SLACK. If it's not correct, then we know the first letter must be F? 

 So let's try SLACK.

 But wait: what if there are more than two possibilities? 
   Other words: 
      WLACK? -> not a word.
      VLACK? -> not.
      ... so only FLACK and SLACK? 

 Actually, I can think of:
      CLACK: but C is already at position4 -> duplicate? and we are avoiding duplicates? Also, we know C is at position4 and we are putting C at position1? But we know from the first guess that C is not at position1. So CLACK is invalid because it has C at position1 which we know is wrong.

   So only FLACK and SLACK.

 Therefore, we can try SLACK.

 If the feedback for SLACK:
   Position1: S -> if it's correct, then we get ✓. If not, then we get x? But if it's x, then the secret word must be FLACK.

 So we can solve it in at most two more guesses.

 But we are on the third guess, so we can try SLACK.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has both S and F? But we don't have any other positions to test? Because positions 2-5 are fixed. So we cannot test two letters at once? 

 Therefore, we must guess one of the two.

 I choose SLACK because it's more common.

 So the guess is ""SLACK"".

 But note: we are not forced to use the fixed positions? We could use a different word? But why? We know the last four letters are LACK. So we must use that.

 Therefore, we guess ""SLACK"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C is present but not in position 1, R is absent, A is correct in position 3, N and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""black"")**: B is absent, L is correct in position 2, A is correct in position 3, C is correct in position 4, K is correct in position 5.

### Deductions:
1. The secret word structure is: **`_ L A C K`** (positions 2–5 are confirmed).
2. The missing first letter must:
   - **Be absent** from the eliminated letters: **B, R, N, E** (from feedback).
   - **Not be** L, A, C, or K (since these are confirmed in positions 2–5, and no duplicates have been indicated in feedback).
3. Possible first letters: **F, S** (common letters that form valid words: **FLACK** or **SLACK**).

### Strategy:
- Test **""SLACK""** as the next guess. It is a common word and will confirm if **S** is the first letter. If incorrect, the solution must be **FLACK** (solved in the next guess).",Guess 3: slack -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(✓) A(✓) C(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
