We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
 E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The 4th letter is N.
 - The 5th letter is E.
 - The letters C, R, and A are not in the word.

 Since the word is 5 letters and ends with ""NE"", we can write: _ _ _ N E

 We also know that C, R, A are absent. So we must avoid these letters.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to find a word that:
 1. Ends with ""NE"" (so the 4th and 5th letters are N and E).
 2. Does not contain C, R, or A.
 3. Uses other common letters to get more information.

 We have 3 positions to figure out (the first three letters). We should try to include common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried yet.

 Since we don't know the first three letters, we can try a word that uses common letters like S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 Let's think of words ending with ""NE"":

 Some possibilities: 
   SHINE, THINE, PHONE, STONE, etc.

 But note: we must avoid the letters C, R, A.

 Let's check:
   SHINE: S, H, I, N, E -> no C, R, A -> valid.
   THINE: T, H, I, N, E -> no C, R, A -> valid.
   PHONE: P, H, O, N, E -> no C, R, A -> valid.
   STONE: S, T, O, N, E -> no C, R, A -> valid.

 However, we also want to test as many new letters as possible. We have already used C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid repeating these except for N and E which are fixed.

 We can use S, T, H, I, O, P, etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters we haven't tried. For example, S and T are very common.

 We can try ""STONE"": 
   S, T, O, N, E.

 But note: we know N and E are fixed, so we are testing S, T, and O in the first three positions.

 Alternatively, ""SHINE"" tests S, H, I.

 Since we have no information about the first three letters, we can choose one that covers more common letters.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has a vowel in the second position because the first word had a vowel in the third (A) and we know it's absent, so we need to test other vowels.

 The vowels we haven't tried are: I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We tried A and E (E is present but at the end).

 Let's try to include I and O? But we can only test three new letters.

 I think ""SHINE"" is a good candidate because it uses S, H, I (all common) and we avoid the forbidden letters.

 However, note that the feedback for the first guess told us that the word does not have C, R, A. So we are free to use other letters.

 Another possibility: ""OPINE"" (but O is a vowel and we haven't tried it). But let's avoid repeating the same structure.

 Alternatively, we can try ""THINE"" or ""PHONE"".

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to get more information.

 I will choose ""SHINE"" because:
   - It has S and H which are common consonants, and I which is a common vowel.
   - It ends with NE as required.

 So the guess is ""SHINE"".

 However, let me check if ""SHINE"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Therefore, we guess ""SHINE"".

 But note: we are not required to have the correct N and E in the same positions? Actually, we know they are fixed at the 4th and 5th positions, so we must put N at the 4th and E at the 5th.

 So the word must be of the form: _ _ _ N E.

 We are guessing: S H I N E.

 We are testing:
   First letter: S
   Second letter: H
   Third letter: I

 Let's see what feedback we might get? But we don't know the word yet.

 We are hoping to get information about the first three letters.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't repeat the positions of the first guess? But the first guess had N and E in the 4th and 5th, and now we are putting them in the same positions, which is correct.

 So, I think ""SHINE"" is a good second guess.

 However, note that we have not used T, which is a very common letter. Maybe we can use a word that includes T.

 Let me think of words ending with ""NE"" that include T and avoid C, R, A.

 Examples: 
   TUNE: T, U, N, E -> but that's only 4 letters? Wait, 5 letters: T U N E? No, TUNE is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

   STONE: S, T, O, N, E -> 5 letters, and avoids C, R, A.

   THINE: T, H, I, N, E -> 5 letters.

   PHONE: P, H, O, N, E.

   Also, ""TRINE"" but T is new, but R is forbidden? We cannot use R because we know it's absent. So TRINE is invalid because of R.

 So, between ""STONE"", ""THINE"", ""PHONE"", and ""SHINE"", which one?

 We want to maximize the number of new common letters.

 Common letters: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know A, R are out. So we have T, O, I, S, H, etc.

 ""STONE"": S, T, O, N, E -> tests S, T, O (and we know N and E are fixed). So three new letters: S, T, O.

 ""THINE"": T, H, I, N, E -> tests T, H, I.

 ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> tests P, H, O.

 ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> tests S, H, I.

 The most common letters among these are T, S, O, I, H.

 Since T is the second most common letter in English, we might want to test it.

 So, let's choose ""STONE"" to test S, T, and O.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has T or not. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T and also a vowel we haven't tried, like O or I.

 I think ""STONE"" is a good choice because it tests two very common consonants (S and T) and a common vowel (O).

 Therefore, I will go with ""STONE"".

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word might have two N's? We know N is at the 4th position, but could there be another N? The feedback for the first guess only showed one N (and it was correct). However, if there were two N's, the feedback might have shown two N's? But in the first guess, we had only one N (at the 4th position) and it was correct. The feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess duplicates. So we don't know.

 But for now, we are not testing for duplicate N. We can assume one N until we get more information.

 So, let's choose ""STONE"".

 However, note that the word must be 5 letters and end with NE. So the pattern is: _ _ _ N E.

 We are guessing: S T O N E.

 If the word is ""STONE"", then we are done. But if not, we get feedback.

 So, I will guess ""STONE"".

 But let me confirm: we are avoiding C, R, A? Yes, STONE has S, T, O, N, E. No C, R, A.

 Therefore, the second guess is ""STONE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- N is correct and in the 4th position (✓).
- E is correct and in the 5th position (✓).

This means:
- The secret word ends with ""NE"" (positions 4 and 5).
- The letters C, R, and A are absent.
- The first three letters are unknown but must exclude C, R, A.

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word ending with ""NE"".
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, H) to gather more information about positions 1–3.
- Avoids C, R, A.

A strong candidate is **""STONE""**:
- Tests S (position 1), T (position 2), and O (position 3).
- Uses high-frequency consonants (S, T) and a common vowel (O).
- Complies with the known pattern: \_ \_ \_ N E.

 Therefore, we guess ""SHINE"".

 But note: we are not required to have the correct N and E in the same positions? Actually, we know they are fixed at the 4th and 5th positions, so we must put N at the 4th and E at the 5th.

 So the word must be of the form: _ _ _ N E.

 We are guessing: S H I N E.

 We are testing:
   First letter: S
   Second letter: H
   Third letter: I

 Let's see what feedback we might get? But we don't know the word yet.

 We are hoping to get information about the first three letters.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't repeat the positions of the first guess? But the first guess had N and E in the 4th and 5th, and now we are putting them in the same positions, which is correct.

 So, I think ""SHINE"" is a good second guess.

 However, note that we have not used T, which is a very common letter. Maybe we can use a word that includes T.

 Let me think of words ending with ""NE"" that include T and avoid C, R, A.

 Examples: 
   TUNE: T, U, N, E -> but that's only 4 letters? Wait, 5 letters: T U N E? No, TUNE is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

   STONE: S, T, O, N, E -> 5 letters, and avoids C, R, A.

   THINE: T, H, I, N, E -> 5 letters.

   PHONE: P, H, O, N, E.

   Also, ""TRINE"" but T is new, but R is forbidden? We cannot use R because we know it's absent. So TRINE is invalid because of R.

 So, between ""STONE"", ""THINE"", ""PHONE"", and ""SHINE"", which one?

 We want to maximize the number of new common letters.

 Common letters: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know A, R are out. So we have T, O, I, S, H, etc.

 ""STONE"": S, T, O, N, E -> tests S, T, O (and we know N and E are fixed). So three new letters: S, T, O.

 ""THINE"": T, H, I, N, E -> tests T, H, I.

 ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> tests P, H, O.

 ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> tests S, H, I.

 The most common letters among these are T, S, O, I, H.

 Since T is the second most common letter in English, we might want to test it.

 So, let's choose ""STONE"" to test S, T, and O.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has T or not. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T and also a vowel we haven't tried, like O or I.

 I think ""STONE"" is a good choice because it tests two very common consonants (S and T) and a common vowel (O).

 Therefore, I will go with ""STONE"".

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word might have two N's? We know N is at the 4th position, but could there be another N? The feedback for the first guess only showed one N (and it was correct). However, if there were two N's, the feedback might have shown two N's? But in the first guess, we had only one N (at the 4th position) and it was correct. The feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess duplicates. So we don't know.

 But for now, we are not testing for duplicate N. We can assume one N until we get more information.

 So, let's choose ""STONE"".

 However, note that the word must be 5 letters and end with NE. So the pattern is: _ _ _ N E.

 We are guessing: S T O N E.

 If the word is ""STONE"", then we are done. But if not, we get feedback.

 So, I will guess ""STONE"".

 But let me confirm: we are avoiding C, R, A? Yes, STONE has S, T, O, N, E. No C, R, A.

 Therefore, the second guess is ""STONE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- N is correct and in the 4th position (✓).
- E is correct and in the 5th position (✓).

This means:
- The secret word ends with ""NE"" (positions 4 and 5).
- The letters C, R, and A are absent.
- The first three letters are unknown but must exclude C, R, A.

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word ending with ""NE"".
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, H) to gather more information about positions 1–3.
- Avoids C, R, A.

A strong candidate is **""STONE""**:
- Tests S (position 1), T (position 2), and O (position 3).
- Uses high-frequency consonants (S, T) and a common vowel (O).
- Complies with the known pattern: \_ \_ \_ N E.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(✓)
Guess 2: ""stone"" -> S(x), T(x), O(x), N(✓), E(✓)

From this, we know:
- The 4th letter is N and the 5th letter is E. So the word pattern is: _ _ _ N E
- The letters C, R, A, S, T, O are all absent from the word. (Since they are marked as ""x"" and we have no indication of duplicates, we assume they are not in the word.)

Therefore, the word must be composed of letters that are not in the set {C, R, A, S, T, O} and must have N in the 4th position and E in the 5th.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form _ _ _ N E, using only letters not in {C, R, A, S, T, O}.

Let's list the remaining common letters. The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have excluded 6 letters (C, R, A, S, T, O). So we have 20 letters left.

But we should focus on common letters that appear in 5-letter words.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: I, U, Y (since A, E, O are either absent or already placed; E is placed at the end, but note that E might appear elsewhere? However, we don't know. The feedback only tells us about the E at the 5th position. It could be that there is another E? But we haven't tested for that. Similarly, for N, we only know about the one at the 4th position.)

But note: in the feedback, for ""crane"", E was marked as correct and in position, but that doesn't prevent the word from having another E. Similarly for ""stone"", E was again marked correct. However, we haven't tested for duplicate E. But since we are only required to form a word with the pattern, we can consider the possibility.

But to be efficient, we should try to use a word that tests new letters and also might reveal if there are duplicates.

However, we have limited guesses (only 4 left). We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

We know the word ends with ""NE"". We need to guess the first three letters.

Let's think of words that end with ""NE"" and do not contain C, R, A, S, T, O.

Some possibilities:
- ""PHONE"": but O is in it, and we know O is absent (from the second guess: O(x)). So invalid.
- ""SHINE"": S is absent (from second guess: S(x)), so invalid.
- ""THINE"": T is absent (from second guess: T(x)), so invalid.
- ""ALONE"": A is absent (from first guess: A(x)) and O is absent, so invalid.
- ""BRINE"": B, R, I, N, E -> but R is absent (from first guess: R(x)), so invalid.
- ""PRUNE"": P, R, U, N, E -> R is absent, invalid.
- ""PLANE"": P, L, A, N, E -> A is absent, invalid.
- ""DWINE"": D, W, I, N, E -> but is ""dwine"" a word? It might be archaic. We need common words.
- ""WHINE"": W, H, I, N, E -> but W, H, I are not excluded? Let's check: we haven't used W, H, I. And it doesn't contain C, R, A, S, T, O. So ""WHINE"" is a candidate.

But wait, is ""WHINE"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to complain.

Other candidates:
- ""SHINE"" is invalid because of S.
- ""THINE"" is invalid because of T.
- ""QUINE"": Q, U, I, N, E -> not a common word? ""Quine"" is a proper name or a term in philosophy, but might not be in the word list.
- ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> R is absent, invalid.
- ""OPINE"": O is absent, invalid.

So ""WHINE"" seems a candidate. But let's see if there are others.

- ""ALINE"": A is absent, invalid.
- ""KNEAD"": but doesn't end with NE? It ends with EAD. We need ...NE.
- ""MINCE"": but ends with CE, and C is absent. Invalid.

Another one: ""DIANE""? But that's a name and it ends with E? Actually, ""DIANE"" is 5 letters: D-I-A-N-E. But A is absent, so invalid.

""BINGE"": B, I, N, G, E -> but N is at the 3rd position? We need N at the 4th. So the pattern must be _ _ _ N E, so the third letter must be the one before N. In ""BINGE"", the 4th letter is G, not N. So invalid.

We must have the 4th letter as N and 5th as E. So the word must be of the form: X Y Z N E.

So we need words where the first three letters are from the remaining alphabet and form a valid word with ""NE"" at the end.

Let's list possible words:

- ""WHINE"": W H I N E -> positions: W(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). This is valid and uses W, H, I.

Other possibilities:
- ""SHINE"": invalid because of S.
- ""THINE"": invalid because of T.
- ""PHONE"": invalid because of O.
- ""PRUNE"": invalid because of R.
- ""BRINE"": invalid because of R and also B? B is not excluded, but R is. So invalid.
- ""TRINE"": T and R, both excluded.
- ""DWINE"": D W I N E -> is this a word? It might be an old word for waste away, but not common. We should avoid if possible.
- ""SWINE"": S is excluded, invalid.
- ""TWINE"": T is excluded, invalid.

What about ""URINE""? U R I N E -> R is excluded.

""QUEUE"": doesn't end with NE.

""PIQUE"": doesn't end with NE.

""BULGE"": doesn't end with NE.

""PURGE"": doesn't end with NE.

""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> but then the 4th letter is G, not N. So invalid.

""MANGE"": M A N G E -> A is excluded, and also the 4th letter is G, not N. Invalid.

""RANGE"": R and A excluded.

""BINGE"": as above, 4th letter is G.

We need the 4th letter to be N. So the third letter must be the one that comes before N and E.

Another candidate: ""WINCE"": W I N C E -> but C is excluded (from first guess: C(x)), and also the 4th letter is C, not N? Wait, ""WINCE"" is W(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). So the N is at position 3, not 4. We need N at position 4. So invalid.

Similarly, ""DANCE"": D A N C E -> A and C excluded, and N is at position 3? D(1), A(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). So N is at 3, not 4. Invalid.

We need the N to be at the 4th position. So the word must be ? ? ? N E.

The third letter must be a consonant or vowel that can come before N.

Common words:
- ""ALONE"": invalid (A and O excluded)
- ""PHONE"": invalid (O excluded)
- ""STONE"": invalid (we already tried and it had S,T,O excluded)
- ""SHINE"": invalid (S excluded)
- ""THINE"": invalid (T excluded)

Less common:
- ""WHINE"": as above, valid and uses W, H, I.
- ""DWINE"": if accepted, D, W, I, N, E.
- ""TWINE"": T excluded.

Another one: ""OPINE"": O excluded.

""ELUDE"": doesn't end with NE.

""EXILE"": doesn't end with NE.

""ADOBE"": doesn't end with NE.

We might have to consider ""WHINE"" as a candidate. But note, we are making a guess to get information, not necessarily the answer.

We have 4 guesses left. We can use this guess to test multiple new letters.

We know the word is ? ? ? N E, and the missing letters are from the set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C, R, A, S, T, O).

We should try a word that uses common letters from this set to maximize information.

For example, H, I, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

But we are constrained by the word needing to end with ""NE"". So we must have a word of the form XYZNE.

We can try ""WHINE"" to test W, H, I.

But note: if we guess ""WHINE"", and it's not the word, we might get feedback that tells us about W, H, I.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a different set of letters, such as including U or P.

But let's see if there is a word like ""PURGE""? No, doesn't end with NE.

""PRUNE"": has R, excluded.

""PLUME"": doesn't end with NE.

""BLUFF"": doesn't end with NE.

""JUICE"": doesn't end with NE, and C excluded.

""QUILL"": doesn't end with NE.

""QUINE"": as I thought earlier, it might not be in the word list. But let's assume we stick to common words.

Another candidate: ""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> but the 4th letter is G, not N. And it has two E's? But we don't know if E is duplicated. However, the pattern requires N at 4th. So invalid.

""DEIGN"": D, E, I, G, N -> ends with GN, not NE. Invalid.

""FEIGN"": F, E, I, G, N -> same, ends with GN.

""REIGN"": R excluded.

""VEIN"": only 4 letters.

""VEINE""? Not a word.

""PIED"": not 5 letters.

We might be missing some words. Let me think of common words ending with ""INE"", ""UNE"", etc.

For ""INE"":
- ""AINE"": not common, and A excluded.
- ""BINE"": not common? (as in woodbine, but that's 8 letters) 
- ""DINE"": D, I, N, E -> but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So ""DINE"" is 4.
- ""FINE"": F, I, N, E -> 4 letters.
- ""KINE"": K, I, N, E -> 4 letters (archaic for cows).
- ""LINE"": L, I, N, E -> 4 letters.
- ""MINE"": M, I, N, E -> 4 letters.
- ""NINE"": N, I, N, E -> but N at position 1 and 3? We need 5 letters. ""NINE"" is 4.
- ""PINE"": P, I, N, E -> 4 letters.
- ""SINE"": S excluded, and 4 letters.
- ""TINE"": T excluded, 4 letters.
- ""VINE"": V, I, N, E -> 4 letters.
- ""WINE"": W, I, N, E -> 4 letters.

But we need 5 letters. So we need words that have 5 letters and end with ""INE"". 

5-letter words ending with ""INE"":
- ""ALINE"": A excluded.
- ""CANINE"": 6 letters.
- ""FELINE"": 6 letters.
- ""OPINE"": O excluded.
- ""PRUNE"": R excluded, and ends with UNE, not INE.
- ""TRINE"": T and R excluded.
- ""URINE"": R excluded.
- ""WHINE"": W, H, I, N, E -> 5 letters. This is one.

Another one: ""SHINE"": S excluded.

""THINE"": T excluded.

""DWINE"": D, W, I, N, E -> 5 letters. It is a word (to waste away, or Scottish for decline). But it's not very common.

""TWINE"": T excluded.

""QUINE"": Q, U, I, N, E -> 5 letters. It is a surname and a term in logic, but might be accepted in some word lists. However, in Wordle, they use common words.

Another one: ""BRINE"": B, R, I, N, E -> R excluded.

""CRINE"": C, R, I, N, E -> C and R excluded, and it's not common.

""DRINE"": not a word.

""GRINE"": not common.

""PRINE"": not common.

""TRINE"": already considered.

So the only common 5-letter word ending with ""INE"" that doesn't use excluded letters is ""WHINE"".

What about ending with ""UNE""? 
- ""PRUNE"": R excluded.
- ""TRUNE"": not a word.
- ""DUNE"": D, U, N, E -> 4 letters.

5-letter words ending with ""UNE"": 
- ""FORTUNE"": 7 letters.
- ""TUNE"": 4 letters.
- ""JUNE"": 4 letters.
- ""RUNE"": 4 letters.

No common 5-letter words ending with ""UNE"".

Ending with ""YNE"": 
- ""BYNE"": not a word.
- ""EYNE"": archaic for eyes, 4 letters.

Not helpful.

Ending with ""ON E"": but O is excluded.

So ""WHINE"" seems the best candidate.

But note: we have the possibility of the word having duplicate letters? For example, could the word have two E's? We know E is at the end, but maybe also at the beginning or middle? We haven't tested that.

Similarly, for N, we know one at position 4, but maybe another?

But in ""WHINE"", we are testing W, H, I, and also we are putting E at the end, which we know is correct. If the word has an E elsewhere, we might not know.

But we are constrained by the word pattern.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't have E at the end to test for duplicate E? But we know E is at the end, and if we don't put E at the end, we might get a '-' if there is another E, but we are required to have the pattern? No, we are not required, but we know the 4th and 5th letters are fixed. So we should use that to our advantage.

But to test for duplicate E, we could put an E in another position. However, we have only 4 guesses left, and we know two positions, so it might be better to focus on the first three.

But let's see: if we guess a word that has E in the first position, for example, and N in the fourth and E in the fifth, then if there is an E in the first, we would get a '-' for the first position. But we don't know if that E is the same as the fifth or a duplicate.

But we can try.

However, we are limited by the available words.

Another candidate: ""EVENT"": but doesn't end with NE, and T is excluded.

""EXILE"": doesn't end with NE.

""ELIDE"": doesn't end with NE.

""EMBED"": doesn't end with NE.

It's hard to find a 5-letter word that ends with NE and has E in the first position and avoids the excluded letters.

For example, ""EERIE"": doesn't end with NE.

""ELATE"": A excluded.

So probably not.

Therefore, I think ""WHINE"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's consider: we have not used the letters D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

In ""WHINE"", we are testing W, H, I.

If we get feedback that W is absent, H is absent, I is absent, then we know the word must be something else with other letters.

But if we get a correct or misplaced, we get information.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that uses more common letters like L, D, U.

For example, ""DUVET"": doesn't end with NE.

""PULSE"": S excluded.

""LUNGE"": doesn't end with NE.

""MIDGE"": doesn't end with NE.

""BADGE"": doesn't end with NE.

It's very difficult to find a word that fits the pattern and tests more common letters.

Another idea: ""HINGE"": H, I, N, G, E -> but the 4th letter is G, not N. So invalid.

""MINCE"": M, I, N, C, E -> C excluded, and N is at position 3? M(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). So N is at 3, not 4. Invalid.

""WINDY"": doesn't end with NE.

""WIELD"": doesn't end with NE.

So I think ""WHINE"" is the best we can do.

Therefore, I will guess ""WHINE"".

But note: we have feedback that in the first guess, A was absent, and in the second, O was absent, so we are safe.

So the guess is ""WHINE"".

But let's double-check the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""PHONE"" but we know O is absent, so not.

Or if the word is ""SHINE"", but S is absent.

So ""WHINE"" is a valid guess.

We'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, A are absent (x), N is correct and in position 4 (✓), E is correct and in position 5 (✓).
- **Guess 2 (stone)**: S, T, O are absent (x), N is correct and in position 4 (✓), E is correct and in position 5 (✓).

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern `_ _ _ N E` (N in position 4, E in position 5).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, O (cannot appear in the word).
- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The goal is to test new common letters (e.g., H, I, W, D, L) to gather information about positions 1–3.

### Analysis for the Next Guess:
- We need a 5-letter word ending in ""NE"" that avoids C, R, A, S, T, O.
- After evaluating options (e.g., ""shine"" invalid due to S, ""thine"" invalid due to T, ""phone"" invalid due to O), the strongest candidate is **""WHINE""**:
  - Uses new common letters: W (position 1), H (position 2), I (position 3).
  - Tests for possible vowels (I) and consonants (W, H) in the unknown positions.
  - If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the possibilities significantly (e.g., revealing if W, H, or I are present or absent).

<guess>whine</guess>",whine,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(✓)
Guess 2: ""stone"" -> S(x), T(x), O(x), N(✓), E(✓)

From this, we know:
- The 4th letter is N and the 5th letter is E. So the word pattern is: _ _ _ N E
- The letters C, R, A, S, T, O are all absent from the word. (Since they are marked as ""x"" and we have no indication of duplicates, we assume they are not in the word.)

Therefore, the word must be composed of letters that are not in the set {C, R, A, S, T, O} and must have N in the 4th position and E in the 5th.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form _ _ _ N E, using only letters not in {C, R, A, S, T, O}.

Let's list the remaining common letters. The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have excluded 6 letters (C, R, A, S, T, O). So we have 20 letters left.

But we should focus on common letters that appear in 5-letter words.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: I, U, Y (since A, E, O are either absent or already placed; E is placed at the end, but note that E might appear elsewhere? However, we don't know. The feedback only tells us about the E at the 5th position. It could be that there is another E? But we haven't tested for that. Similarly, for N, we only know about the one at the 4th position.)

But note: in the feedback, for ""crane"", E was marked as correct and in position, but that doesn't prevent the word from having another E. Similarly for ""stone"", E was again marked correct. However, we haven't tested for duplicate E. But since we are only required to form a word with the pattern, we can consider the possibility.

But to be efficient, we should try to use a word that tests new letters and also might reveal if there are duplicates.

However, we have limited guesses (only 4 left). We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

We know the word ends with ""NE"". We need to guess the first three letters.

Let's think of words that end with ""NE"" and do not contain C, R, A, S, T, O.

Some possibilities:
- ""PHONE"": but O is in it, and we know O is absent (from the second guess: O(x)). So invalid.
- ""SHINE"": S is absent (from second guess: S(x)), so invalid.
- ""THINE"": T is absent (from second guess: T(x)), so invalid.
- ""ALONE"": A is absent (from first guess: A(x)) and O is absent, so invalid.
- ""BRINE"": B, R, I, N, E -> but R is absent (from first guess: R(x)), so invalid.
- ""PRUNE"": P, R, U, N, E -> R is absent, invalid.
- ""PLANE"": P, L, A, N, E -> A is absent, invalid.
- ""DWINE"": D, W, I, N, E -> but is ""dwine"" a word? It might be archaic. We need common words.
- ""WHINE"": W, H, I, N, E -> but W, H, I are not excluded? Let's check: we haven't used W, H, I. And it doesn't contain C, R, A, S, T, O. So ""WHINE"" is a candidate.

But wait, is ""WHINE"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to complain.

Other candidates:
- ""SHINE"" is invalid because of S.
- ""THINE"" is invalid because of T.
- ""QUINE"": Q, U, I, N, E -> not a common word? ""Quine"" is a proper name or a term in philosophy, but might not be in the word list.
- ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> R is absent, invalid.
- ""OPINE"": O is absent, invalid.

So ""WHINE"" seems a candidate. But let's see if there are others.

- ""ALINE"": A is absent, invalid.
- ""KNEAD"": but doesn't end with NE? It ends with EAD. We need ...NE.
- ""MINCE"": but ends with CE, and C is absent. Invalid.

Another one: ""DIANE""? But that's a name and it ends with E? Actually, ""DIANE"" is 5 letters: D-I-A-N-E. But A is absent, so invalid.

""BINGE"": B, I, N, G, E -> but N is at the 3rd position? We need N at the 4th. So the pattern must be _ _ _ N E, so the third letter must be the one before N. In ""BINGE"", the 4th letter is G, not N. So invalid.

We must have the 4th letter as N and 5th as E. So the word must be of the form: X Y Z N E.

So we need words where the first three letters are from the remaining alphabet and form a valid word with ""NE"" at the end.

Let's list possible words:

- ""WHINE"": W H I N E -> positions: W(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). This is valid and uses W, H, I.

Other possibilities:
- ""SHINE"": invalid because of S.
- ""THINE"": invalid because of T.
- ""PHONE"": invalid because of O.
- ""PRUNE"": invalid because of R.
- ""BRINE"": invalid because of R and also B? B is not excluded, but R is. So invalid.
- ""TRINE"": T and R, both excluded.
- ""DWINE"": D W I N E -> is this a word? It might be an old word for waste away, but not common. We should avoid if possible.
- ""SWINE"": S is excluded, invalid.
- ""TWINE"": T is excluded, invalid.

What about ""URINE""? U R I N E -> R is excluded.

""QUEUE"": doesn't end with NE.

""PIQUE"": doesn't end with NE.

""BULGE"": doesn't end with NE.

""PURGE"": doesn't end with NE.

""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> but then the 4th letter is G, not N. So invalid.

""MANGE"": M A N G E -> A is excluded, and also the 4th letter is G, not N. Invalid.

""RANGE"": R and A excluded.

""BINGE"": as above, 4th letter is G.

We need the 4th letter to be N. So the third letter must be the one that comes before N and E.

Another candidate: ""WINCE"": W I N C E -> but C is excluded (from first guess: C(x)), and also the 4th letter is C, not N? Wait, ""WINCE"" is W(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). So the N is at position 3, not 4. We need N at position 4. So invalid.

Similarly, ""DANCE"": D A N C E -> A and C excluded, and N is at position 3? D(1), A(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). So N is at 3, not 4. Invalid.

We need the N to be at the 4th position. So the word must be ? ? ? N E.

The third letter must be a consonant or vowel that can come before N.

Common words:
- ""ALONE"": invalid (A and O excluded)
- ""PHONE"": invalid (O excluded)
- ""STONE"": invalid (we already tried and it had S,T,O excluded)
- ""SHINE"": invalid (S excluded)
- ""THINE"": invalid (T excluded)

Less common:
- ""WHINE"": as above, valid and uses W, H, I.
- ""DWINE"": if accepted, D, W, I, N, E.
- ""TWINE"": T excluded.

Another one: ""OPINE"": O excluded.

""ELUDE"": doesn't end with NE.

""EXILE"": doesn't end with NE.

""ADOBE"": doesn't end with NE.

We might have to consider ""WHINE"" as a candidate. But note, we are making a guess to get information, not necessarily the answer.

We have 4 guesses left. We can use this guess to test multiple new letters.

We know the word is ? ? ? N E, and the missing letters are from the set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C, R, A, S, T, O).

We should try a word that uses common letters from this set to maximize information.

For example, H, I, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

But we are constrained by the word needing to end with ""NE"". So we must have a word of the form XYZNE.

We can try ""WHINE"" to test W, H, I.

But note: if we guess ""WHINE"", and it's not the word, we might get feedback that tells us about W, H, I.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a different set of letters, such as including U or P.

But let's see if there is a word like ""PURGE""? No, doesn't end with NE.

""PRUNE"": has R, excluded.

""PLUME"": doesn't end with NE.

""BLUFF"": doesn't end with NE.

""JUICE"": doesn't end with NE, and C excluded.

""QUILL"": doesn't end with NE.

""QUINE"": as I thought earlier, it might not be in the word list. But let's assume we stick to common words.

Another candidate: ""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> but the 4th letter is G, not N. And it has two E's? But we don't know if E is duplicated. However, the pattern requires N at 4th. So invalid.

""DEIGN"": D, E, I, G, N -> ends with GN, not NE. Invalid.

""FEIGN"": F, E, I, G, N -> same, ends with GN.

""REIGN"": R excluded.

""VEIN"": only 4 letters.

""VEINE""? Not a word.

""PIED"": not 5 letters.

We might be missing some words. Let me think of common words ending with ""INE"", ""UNE"", etc.

For ""INE"":
- ""AINE"": not common, and A excluded.
- ""BINE"": not common? (as in woodbine, but that's 8 letters) 
- ""DINE"": D, I, N, E -> but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So ""DINE"" is 4.
- ""FINE"": F, I, N, E -> 4 letters.
- ""KINE"": K, I, N, E -> 4 letters (archaic for cows).
- ""LINE"": L, I, N, E -> 4 letters.
- ""MINE"": M, I, N, E -> 4 letters.
- ""NINE"": N, I, N, E -> but N at position 1 and 3? We need 5 letters. ""NINE"" is 4.
- ""PINE"": P, I, N, E -> 4 letters.
- ""SINE"": S excluded, and 4 letters.
- ""TINE"": T excluded, 4 letters.
- ""VINE"": V, I, N, E -> 4 letters.
- ""WINE"": W, I, N, E -> 4 letters.

But we need 5 letters. So we need words that have 5 letters and end with ""INE"". 

5-letter words ending with ""INE"":
- ""ALINE"": A excluded.
- ""CANINE"": 6 letters.
- ""FELINE"": 6 letters.
- ""OPINE"": O excluded.
- ""PRUNE"": R excluded, and ends with UNE, not INE.
- ""TRINE"": T and R excluded.
- ""URINE"": R excluded.
- ""WHINE"": W, H, I, N, E -> 5 letters. This is one.

Another one: ""SHINE"": S excluded.

""THINE"": T excluded.

""DWINE"": D, W, I, N, E -> 5 letters. It is a word (to waste away, or Scottish for decline). But it's not very common.

""TWINE"": T excluded.

""QUINE"": Q, U, I, N, E -> 5 letters. It is a surname and a term in logic, but might be accepted in some word lists. However, in Wordle, they use common words.

Another one: ""BRINE"": B, R, I, N, E -> R excluded.

""CRINE"": C, R, I, N, E -> C and R excluded, and it's not common.

""DRINE"": not a word.

""GRINE"": not common.

""PRINE"": not common.

""TRINE"": already considered.

So the only common 5-letter word ending with ""INE"" that doesn't use excluded letters is ""WHINE"".

What about ending with ""UNE""? 
- ""PRUNE"": R excluded.
- ""TRUNE"": not a word.
- ""DUNE"": D, U, N, E -> 4 letters.

5-letter words ending with ""UNE"": 
- ""FORTUNE"": 7 letters.
- ""TUNE"": 4 letters.
- ""JUNE"": 4 letters.
- ""RUNE"": 4 letters.

No common 5-letter words ending with ""UNE"".

Ending with ""YNE"": 
- ""BYNE"": not a word.
- ""EYNE"": archaic for eyes, 4 letters.

Not helpful.

Ending with ""ON E"": but O is excluded.

So ""WHINE"" seems the best candidate.

But note: we have the possibility of the word having duplicate letters? For example, could the word have two E's? We know E is at the end, but maybe also at the beginning or middle? We haven't tested that.

Similarly, for N, we know one at position 4, but maybe another?

But in ""WHINE"", we are testing W, H, I, and also we are putting E at the end, which we know is correct. If the word has an E elsewhere, we might not know.

But we are constrained by the word pattern.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't have E at the end to test for duplicate E? But we know E is at the end, and if we don't put E at the end, we might get a '-' if there is another E, but we are required to have the pattern? No, we are not required, but we know the 4th and 5th letters are fixed. So we should use that to our advantage.

But to test for duplicate E, we could put an E in another position. However, we have only 4 guesses left, and we know two positions, so it might be better to focus on the first three.

But let's see: if we guess a word that has E in the first position, for example, and N in the fourth and E in the fifth, then if there is an E in the first, we would get a '-' for the first position. But we don't know if that E is the same as the fifth or a duplicate.

But we can try.

However, we are limited by the available words.

Another candidate: ""EVENT"": but doesn't end with NE, and T is excluded.

""EXILE"": doesn't end with NE.

""ELIDE"": doesn't end with NE.

""EMBED"": doesn't end with NE.

It's hard to find a 5-letter word that ends with NE and has E in the first position and avoids the excluded letters.

For example, ""EERIE"": doesn't end with NE.

""ELATE"": A excluded.

So probably not.

Therefore, I think ""WHINE"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's consider: we have not used the letters D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

In ""WHINE"", we are testing W, H, I.

If we get feedback that W is absent, H is absent, I is absent, then we know the word must be something else with other letters.

But if we get a correct or misplaced, we get information.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that uses more common letters like L, D, U.

For example, ""DUVET"": doesn't end with NE.

""PULSE"": S excluded.

""LUNGE"": doesn't end with NE.

""MIDGE"": doesn't end with NE.

""BADGE"": doesn't end with NE.

It's very difficult to find a word that fits the pattern and tests more common letters.

Another idea: ""HINGE"": H, I, N, G, E -> but the 4th letter is G, not N. So invalid.

""MINCE"": M, I, N, C, E -> C excluded, and N is at position 3? M(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). So N is at 3, not 4. Invalid.

""WINDY"": doesn't end with NE.

""WIELD"": doesn't end with NE.

So I think ""WHINE"" is the best we can do.

Therefore, I will guess ""WHINE"".

But note: we have feedback that in the first guess, A was absent, and in the second, O was absent, so we are safe.

So the guess is ""WHINE"".

But let's double-check the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""PHONE"" but we know O is absent, so not.

Or if the word is ""SHINE"", but S is absent.

So ""WHINE"" is a valid guess.

We'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, A are absent (x), N is correct and in position 4 (✓), E is correct and in position 5 (✓).
- **Guess 2 (stone)**: S, T, O are absent (x), N is correct and in position 4 (✓), E is correct and in position 5 (✓).

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern `_ _ _ N E` (N in position 4, E in position 5).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, O (cannot appear in the word).
- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The goal is to test new common letters (e.g., H, I, W, D, L) to gather information about positions 1–3.

### Analysis for the Next Guess:
- We need a 5-letter word ending in ""NE"" that avoids C, R, A, S, T, O.
- After evaluating options (e.g., ""shine"" invalid due to S, ""thine"" invalid due to T, ""phone"" invalid due to O), the strongest candidate is **""WHINE""**:
  - Uses new common letters: W (position 1), H (position 2), I (position 3).
  - Tests for possible vowels (I) and consonants (W, H) in the unknown positions.
  - If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the possibilities significantly (e.g., revealing if W, H, or I are present or absent).",Guess 3: whine -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) I(x) N(✓) E(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
 E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The 4th letter is N.
 - The 5th letter is E.
 - The letters C, R, and A are not in the word.

 Since the word is 5 letters and ends with ""NE"", we can write: _ _ _ N E

 We also know that C, R, A are absent. So we must avoid these letters.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to find a word that:
 1. Ends with ""NE"" (so the 4th and 5th letters are N and E).
 2. Does not contain C, R, or A.
 3. Uses other common letters to get more information.

 We have 3 positions to figure out (the first three letters). We should try to include common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried yet.

 Since we don't know the first three letters, we can try a word that uses common letters like S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 Let's think of words ending with ""NE"":

 Some possibilities: 
   SHINE, THINE, PHONE, STONE, etc.

 But note: we must avoid the letters C, R, A.

 Let's check:
   SHINE: S, H, I, N, E -> no C, R, A -> valid.
   THINE: T, H, I, N, E -> no C, R, A -> valid.
   PHONE: P, H, O, N, E -> no C, R, A -> valid.
   STONE: S, T, O, N, E -> no C, R, A -> valid.

 However, we also want to test as many new letters as possible. We have already used C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid repeating these except for N and E which are fixed.

 We can use S, T, H, I, O, P, etc.

 Let's choose a word that has common letters we haven't tried. For example, S and T are very common.

 We can try ""STONE"": 
   S, T, O, N, E.

 But note: we know N and E are fixed, so we are testing S, T, and O in the first three positions.

 Alternatively, ""SHINE"" tests S, H, I.

 Since we have no information about the first three letters, we can choose one that covers more common letters.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has a vowel in the second position because the first word had a vowel in the third (A) and we know it's absent, so we need to test other vowels.

 The vowels we haven't tried are: I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We tried A and E (E is present but at the end).

 Let's try to include I and O? But we can only test three new letters.

 I think ""SHINE"" is a good candidate because it uses S, H, I (all common) and we avoid the forbidden letters.

 However, note that the feedback for the first guess told us that the word does not have C, R, A. So we are free to use other letters.

 Another possibility: ""OPINE"" (but O is a vowel and we haven't tried it). But let's avoid repeating the same structure.

 Alternatively, we can try ""THINE"" or ""PHONE"".

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to get more information.

 I will choose ""SHINE"" because:
   - It has S and H which are common consonants, and I which is a common vowel.
   - It ends with NE as required.

 So the guess is ""SHINE"".

 However, let me check if ""SHINE"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Therefore, we guess ""SHINE"".

 But note: we are not required to have the correct N and E in the same positions? Actually, we know they are fixed at the 4th and 5th positions, so we must put N at the 4th and E at the 5th.

 So the word must be of the form: _ _ _ N E.

 We are guessing: S H I N E.

 We are testing:
   First letter: S
   Second letter: H
   Third letter: I

 Let's see what feedback we might get? But we don't know the word yet.

 We are hoping to get information about the first three letters.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't repeat the positions of the first guess? But the first guess had N and E in the 4th and 5th, and now we are putting them in the same positions, which is correct.

 So, I think ""SHINE"" is a good second guess.

 However, note that we have not used T, which is a very common letter. Maybe we can use a word that includes T.

 Let me think of words ending with ""NE"" that include T and avoid C, R, A.

 Examples: 
   TUNE: T, U, N, E -> but that's only 4 letters? Wait, 5 letters: T U N E? No, TUNE is 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

   STONE: S, T, O, N, E -> 5 letters, and avoids C, R, A.

   THINE: T, H, I, N, E -> 5 letters.

   PHONE: P, H, O, N, E.

   Also, ""TRINE"" but T is new, but R is forbidden? We cannot use R because we know it's absent. So TRINE is invalid because of R.

 So, between ""STONE"", ""THINE"", ""PHONE"", and ""SHINE"", which one?

 We want to maximize the number of new common letters.

 Common letters: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know A, R are out. So we have T, O, I, S, H, etc.

 ""STONE"": S, T, O, N, E -> tests S, T, O (and we know N and E are fixed). So three new letters: S, T, O.

 ""THINE"": T, H, I, N, E -> tests T, H, I.

 ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> tests P, H, O.

 ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> tests S, H, I.

 The most common letters among these are T, S, O, I, H.

 Since T is the second most common letter in English, we might want to test it.

 So, let's choose ""STONE"" to test S, T, and O.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has T or not. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T and also a vowel we haven't tried, like O or I.

 I think ""STONE"" is a good choice because it tests two very common consonants (S and T) and a common vowel (O).

 Therefore, I will go with ""STONE"".

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word might have two N's? We know N is at the 4th position, but could there be another N? The feedback for the first guess only showed one N (and it was correct). However, if there were two N's, the feedback might have shown two N's? But in the first guess, we had only one N (at the 4th position) and it was correct. The feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess duplicates. So we don't know.

 But for now, we are not testing for duplicate N. We can assume one N until we get more information.

 So, let's choose ""STONE"".

 However, note that the word must be 5 letters and end with NE. So the pattern is: _ _ _ N E.

 We are guessing: S T O N E.

 If the word is ""STONE"", then we are done. But if not, we get feedback.

 So, I will guess ""STONE"".

 But let me confirm: we are avoiding C, R, A? Yes, STONE has S, T, O, N, E. No C, R, A.

 Therefore, the second guess is ""STONE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- N is correct and in the 4th position (✓).
- E is correct and in the 5th position (✓).

This means:
- The secret word ends with ""NE"" (positions 4 and 5).
- The letters C, R, and A are absent.
- The first three letters are unknown but must exclude C, R, A.

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word ending with ""NE"".
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, H) to gather more information about positions 1–3.
- Avoids C, R, A.

A strong candidate is **""STONE""**:
- Tests S (position 1), T (position 2), and O (position 3).
- Uses high-frequency consonants (S, T) and a common vowel (O).
- Complies with the known pattern: \_ \_ \_ N E.

<guess>stone</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: stone -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) N(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(✓)
Guess 2: ""stone"" -> S(x), T(x), O(x), N(✓), E(✓)

From this, we know:
- The 4th letter is N and the 5th letter is E. So the word pattern is: _ _ _ N E
- The letters C, R, A, S, T, O are all absent from the word. (Since they are marked as ""x"" and we have no indication of duplicates, we assume they are not in the word.)

Therefore, the word must be composed of letters that are not in the set {C, R, A, S, T, O} and must have N in the 4th position and E in the 5th.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form _ _ _ N E, using only letters not in {C, R, A, S, T, O}.

Let's list the remaining common letters. The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have excluded 6 letters (C, R, A, S, T, O). So we have 20 letters left.

But we should focus on common letters that appear in 5-letter words.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: I, U, Y (since A, E, O are either absent or already placed; E is placed at the end, but note that E might appear elsewhere? However, we don't know. The feedback only tells us about the E at the 5th position. It could be that there is another E? But we haven't tested for that. Similarly, for N, we only know about the one at the 4th position.)

But note: in the feedback, for ""crane"", E was marked as correct and in position, but that doesn't prevent the word from having another E. Similarly for ""stone"", E was again marked correct. However, we haven't tested for duplicate E. But since we are only required to form a word with the pattern, we can consider the possibility.

But to be efficient, we should try to use a word that tests new letters and also might reveal if there are duplicates.

However, we have limited guesses (only 4 left). We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

We know the word ends with ""NE"". We need to guess the first three letters.

Let's think of words that end with ""NE"" and do not contain C, R, A, S, T, O.

Some possibilities:
- ""PHONE"": but O is in it, and we know O is absent (from the second guess: O(x)). So invalid.
- ""SHINE"": S is absent (from second guess: S(x)), so invalid.
- ""THINE"": T is absent (from second guess: T(x)), so invalid.
- ""ALONE"": A is absent (from first guess: A(x)) and O is absent, so invalid.
- ""BRINE"": B, R, I, N, E -> but R is absent (from first guess: R(x)), so invalid.
- ""PRUNE"": P, R, U, N, E -> R is absent, invalid.
- ""PLANE"": P, L, A, N, E -> A is absent, invalid.
- ""DWINE"": D, W, I, N, E -> but is ""dwine"" a word? It might be archaic. We need common words.
- ""WHINE"": W, H, I, N, E -> but W, H, I are not excluded? Let's check: we haven't used W, H, I. And it doesn't contain C, R, A, S, T, O. So ""WHINE"" is a candidate.

But wait, is ""WHINE"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to complain.

Other candidates:
- ""SHINE"" is invalid because of S.
- ""THINE"" is invalid because of T.
- ""QUINE"": Q, U, I, N, E -> not a common word? ""Quine"" is a proper name or a term in philosophy, but might not be in the word list.
- ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> R is absent, invalid.
- ""OPINE"": O is absent, invalid.

So ""WHINE"" seems a candidate. But let's see if there are others.

- ""ALINE"": A is absent, invalid.
- ""KNEAD"": but doesn't end with NE? It ends with EAD. We need ...NE.
- ""MINCE"": but ends with CE, and C is absent. Invalid.

Another one: ""DIANE""? But that's a name and it ends with E? Actually, ""DIANE"" is 5 letters: D-I-A-N-E. But A is absent, so invalid.

""BINGE"": B, I, N, G, E -> but N is at the 3rd position? We need N at the 4th. So the pattern must be _ _ _ N E, so the third letter must be the one before N. In ""BINGE"", the 4th letter is G, not N. So invalid.

We must have the 4th letter as N and 5th as E. So the word must be of the form: X Y Z N E.

So we need words where the first three letters are from the remaining alphabet and form a valid word with ""NE"" at the end.

Let's list possible words:

- ""WHINE"": W H I N E -> positions: W(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). This is valid and uses W, H, I.

Other possibilities:
- ""SHINE"": invalid because of S.
- ""THINE"": invalid because of T.
- ""PHONE"": invalid because of O.
- ""PRUNE"": invalid because of R.
- ""BRINE"": invalid because of R and also B? B is not excluded, but R is. So invalid.
- ""TRINE"": T and R, both excluded.
- ""DWINE"": D W I N E -> is this a word? It might be an old word for waste away, but not common. We should avoid if possible.
- ""SWINE"": S is excluded, invalid.
- ""TWINE"": T is excluded, invalid.

What about ""URINE""? U R I N E -> R is excluded.

""QUEUE"": doesn't end with NE.

""PIQUE"": doesn't end with NE.

""BULGE"": doesn't end with NE.

""PURGE"": doesn't end with NE.

""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> but then the 4th letter is G, not N. So invalid.

""MANGE"": M A N G E -> A is excluded, and also the 4th letter is G, not N. Invalid.

""RANGE"": R and A excluded.

""BINGE"": as above, 4th letter is G.

We need the 4th letter to be N. So the third letter must be the one that comes before N and E.

Another candidate: ""WINCE"": W I N C E -> but C is excluded (from first guess: C(x)), and also the 4th letter is C, not N? Wait, ""WINCE"" is W(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). So the N is at position 3, not 4. We need N at position 4. So invalid.

Similarly, ""DANCE"": D A N C E -> A and C excluded, and N is at position 3? D(1), A(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). So N is at 3, not 4. Invalid.

We need the N to be at the 4th position. So the word must be ? ? ? N E.

The third letter must be a consonant or vowel that can come before N.

Common words:
- ""ALONE"": invalid (A and O excluded)
- ""PHONE"": invalid (O excluded)
- ""STONE"": invalid (we already tried and it had S,T,O excluded)
- ""SHINE"": invalid (S excluded)
- ""THINE"": invalid (T excluded)

Less common:
- ""WHINE"": as above, valid and uses W, H, I.
- ""DWINE"": if accepted, D, W, I, N, E.
- ""TWINE"": T excluded.

Another one: ""OPINE"": O excluded.

""ELUDE"": doesn't end with NE.

""EXILE"": doesn't end with NE.

""ADOBE"": doesn't end with NE.

We might have to consider ""WHINE"" as a candidate. But note, we are making a guess to get information, not necessarily the answer.

We have 4 guesses left. We can use this guess to test multiple new letters.

We know the word is ? ? ? N E, and the missing letters are from the set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C, R, A, S, T, O).

We should try a word that uses common letters from this set to maximize information.

For example, H, I, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

But we are constrained by the word needing to end with ""NE"". So we must have a word of the form XYZNE.

We can try ""WHINE"" to test W, H, I.

But note: if we guess ""WHINE"", and it's not the word, we might get feedback that tells us about W, H, I.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a different set of letters, such as including U or P.

But let's see if there is a word like ""PURGE""? No, doesn't end with NE.

""PRUNE"": has R, excluded.

""PLUME"": doesn't end with NE.

""BLUFF"": doesn't end with NE.

""JUICE"": doesn't end with NE, and C excluded.

""QUILL"": doesn't end with NE.

""QUINE"": as I thought earlier, it might not be in the word list. But let's assume we stick to common words.

Another candidate: ""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> but the 4th letter is G, not N. And it has two E's? But we don't know if E is duplicated. However, the pattern requires N at 4th. So invalid.

""DEIGN"": D, E, I, G, N -> ends with GN, not NE. Invalid.

""FEIGN"": F, E, I, G, N -> same, ends with GN.

""REIGN"": R excluded.

""VEIN"": only 4 letters.

""VEINE""? Not a word.

""PIED"": not 5 letters.

We might be missing some words. Let me think of common words ending with ""INE"", ""UNE"", etc.

For ""INE"":
- ""AINE"": not common, and A excluded.
- ""BINE"": not common? (as in woodbine, but that's 8 letters) 
- ""DINE"": D, I, N, E -> but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So ""DINE"" is 4.
- ""FINE"": F, I, N, E -> 4 letters.
- ""KINE"": K, I, N, E -> 4 letters (archaic for cows).
- ""LINE"": L, I, N, E -> 4 letters.
- ""MINE"": M, I, N, E -> 4 letters.
- ""NINE"": N, I, N, E -> but N at position 1 and 3? We need 5 letters. ""NINE"" is 4.
- ""PINE"": P, I, N, E -> 4 letters.
- ""SINE"": S excluded, and 4 letters.
- ""TINE"": T excluded, 4 letters.
- ""VINE"": V, I, N, E -> 4 letters.
- ""WINE"": W, I, N, E -> 4 letters.

But we need 5 letters. So we need words that have 5 letters and end with ""INE"". 

5-letter words ending with ""INE"":
- ""ALINE"": A excluded.
- ""CANINE"": 6 letters.
- ""FELINE"": 6 letters.
- ""OPINE"": O excluded.
- ""PRUNE"": R excluded, and ends with UNE, not INE.
- ""TRINE"": T and R excluded.
- ""URINE"": R excluded.
- ""WHINE"": W, H, I, N, E -> 5 letters. This is one.

Another one: ""SHINE"": S excluded.

""THINE"": T excluded.

""DWINE"": D, W, I, N, E -> 5 letters. It is a word (to waste away, or Scottish for decline). But it's not very common.

""TWINE"": T excluded.

""QUINE"": Q, U, I, N, E -> 5 letters. It is a surname and a term in logic, but might be accepted in some word lists. However, in Wordle, they use common words.

Another one: ""BRINE"": B, R, I, N, E -> R excluded.

""CRINE"": C, R, I, N, E -> C and R excluded, and it's not common.

""DRINE"": not a word.

""GRINE"": not common.

""PRINE"": not common.

""TRINE"": already considered.

So the only common 5-letter word ending with ""INE"" that doesn't use excluded letters is ""WHINE"".

What about ending with ""UNE""? 
- ""PRUNE"": R excluded.
- ""TRUNE"": not a word.
- ""DUNE"": D, U, N, E -> 4 letters.

5-letter words ending with ""UNE"": 
- ""FORTUNE"": 7 letters.
- ""TUNE"": 4 letters.
- ""JUNE"": 4 letters.
- ""RUNE"": 4 letters.

No common 5-letter words ending with ""UNE"".

Ending with ""YNE"": 
- ""BYNE"": not a word.
- ""EYNE"": archaic for eyes, 4 letters.

Not helpful.

Ending with ""ON E"": but O is excluded.

So ""WHINE"" seems the best candidate.

But note: we have the possibility of the word having duplicate letters? For example, could the word have two E's? We know E is at the end, but maybe also at the beginning or middle? We haven't tested that.

Similarly, for N, we know one at position 4, but maybe another?

But in ""WHINE"", we are testing W, H, I, and also we are putting E at the end, which we know is correct. If the word has an E elsewhere, we might not know.

But we are constrained by the word pattern.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't have E at the end to test for duplicate E? But we know E is at the end, and if we don't put E at the end, we might get a '-' if there is another E, but we are required to have the pattern? No, we are not required, but we know the 4th and 5th letters are fixed. So we should use that to our advantage.

But to test for duplicate E, we could put an E in another position. However, we have only 4 guesses left, and we know two positions, so it might be better to focus on the first three.

But let's see: if we guess a word that has E in the first position, for example, and N in the fourth and E in the fifth, then if there is an E in the first, we would get a '-' for the first position. But we don't know if that E is the same as the fifth or a duplicate.

But we can try.

However, we are limited by the available words.

Another candidate: ""EVENT"": but doesn't end with NE, and T is excluded.

""EXILE"": doesn't end with NE.

""ELIDE"": doesn't end with NE.

""EMBED"": doesn't end with NE.

It's hard to find a 5-letter word that ends with NE and has E in the first position and avoids the excluded letters.

For example, ""EERIE"": doesn't end with NE.

""ELATE"": A excluded.

So probably not.

Therefore, I think ""WHINE"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's consider: we have not used the letters D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

In ""WHINE"", we are testing W, H, I.

If we get feedback that W is absent, H is absent, I is absent, then we know the word must be something else with other letters.

But if we get a correct or misplaced, we get information.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that uses more common letters like L, D, U.

For example, ""DUVET"": doesn't end with NE.

""PULSE"": S excluded.

""LUNGE"": doesn't end with NE.

""MIDGE"": doesn't end with NE.

""BADGE"": doesn't end with NE.

It's very difficult to find a word that fits the pattern and tests more common letters.

Another idea: ""HINGE"": H, I, N, G, E -> but the 4th letter is G, not N. So invalid.

""MINCE"": M, I, N, C, E -> C excluded, and N is at position 3? M(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). So N is at 3, not 4. Invalid.

""WINDY"": doesn't end with NE.

""WIELD"": doesn't end with NE.

So I think ""WHINE"" is the best we can do.

Therefore, I will guess ""WHINE"".

But note: we have feedback that in the first guess, A was absent, and in the second, O was absent, so we are safe.

So the guess is ""WHINE"".

But let's double-check the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""PHONE"" but we know O is absent, so not.

Or if the word is ""SHINE"", but S is absent.

So ""WHINE"" is a valid guess.

We'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, A are absent (x), N is correct and in position 4 (✓), E is correct and in position 5 (✓).
- **Guess 2 (stone)**: S, T, O are absent (x), N is correct and in position 4 (✓), E is correct and in position 5 (✓).

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern `_ _ _ N E` (N in position 4, E in position 5).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, O (cannot appear in the word).
- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The goal is to test new common letters (e.g., H, I, W, D, L) to gather information about positions 1–3.

### Analysis for the Next Guess:
- We need a 5-letter word ending in ""NE"" that avoids C, R, A, S, T, O.
- After evaluating options (e.g., ""shine"" invalid due to S, ""thine"" invalid due to T, ""phone"" invalid due to O), the strongest candidate is **""WHINE""**:
  - Uses new common letters: W (position 1), H (position 2), I (position 3).
  - Tests for possible vowels (I) and consonants (W, H) in the unknown positions.
  - If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the possibilities significantly (e.g., revealing if W, H, or I are present or absent).

Yes, it is.\n\n Therefore, we guess ""SHINE"".\n\n But note: we are not required to have the correct N and E in the same positions? Actually, we know they are fixed at the 4th and 5th positions, so we must put N at the 4th and E at the 5th.\n\n So the word must be of the form: _ _ _ N E.\n\n We are guessing: S H I N E.\n\n We are testing:\n   First letter: S\n   Second letter: H\n   Third letter: I\n\n Let\'s see what feedback we might get?

So three new letters: S, T, O.\n\n ""THINE"": T, H, I, N, E -> tests T, H, I.\n\n ""PHONE"": P, H, O, N, E -> tests P, H, O.\n\n ""SHINE"": S, H, I, N, E -> tests S, H, I.\n\n The most common letters among these are T, S, O, I, H.\n\n Since T is the second most common letter in English, we might want to test it.\n\n So, let\'s choose ""STONE"" to test S, T, and O.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has T or not. We are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T and also a vowel we haven\'t tried, like O or I.\n\n I think ""STONE"" is a good choice because it tests two very common consonants (S and T) and a common vowel (O).\n\n Therefore, I will go with ""STONE"".\n\n But wait, what about the possibility that the word might have two N\'s? We know N is at the 4th position, but could there be another N? The feedback for the first guess only showed one N (and it was correct). However, if there were two N\'s, the feedback might have shown two N\'s? But in the first guess, we had only one N (at the 4th position) and it was correct. The feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are duplicates unless we guess duplicates. So we don\'t know.\n\n But for now, we are not testing for duplicate N. We can assume one N until we get more information.\n\n So, let\'s choose ""STONE"".\n\n However, note that the word must be 5 letters and end with NE. So the pattern is: _ _ _ N E.\n\n We are guessing: S T O N E.\n\n If the word is ""STONE"", then we are done. But if not, we get feedback.\n\n So, I will guess ""STONE"".\n\n But let me confirm: we are avoiding C, R, A? Yes, STONE has S, T, O, N, E. No C, R, A.\n\n Therefore, the second guess is ""STONE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and A are not in the word (marked ""x"").\n- N is correct and in the 4th position (✓).\n- E is correct and in the 5th position (✓).\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word ends with ""NE"" (positions 4 and 5).\n- The letters C, R, and A are absent.\n- The first three letters are unknown but must exclude C, R, A.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must be a 5-letter word ending with ""NE"".\n- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, I, H) to gather more information about positions 1–3.\n- Avoids C, R, A.\n\nA strong candidate is **""STONE""**:\n- Tests S (position 1), T (position 2), and O (position 3).\n- Uses high-frequency consonants (S, T) and a common vowel (O).\n- Complies with the known pattern: \\_ \\_ \\_ N E.\n\n<guess>stone</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stone -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) N(✓) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(✓)\nGuess 2: ""stone"" -> S(x), T(x), O(x), N(✓), E(✓)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The 4th letter is N and the 5th letter is E. So the word pattern is: _ _ _ N E\n- The letters C, R, A, S, T, O are all absent from the word. (Since they are marked as ""x"" and we have no indication of duplicates, we assume they are not in the word.)\n\nTherefore, the word must be composed of letters that are not in the set {C, R, A, S, T, O} and must have N in the 4th position and E in the 5th.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word of the form _ _ _ N E, using only letters not in {C, R, A, S, T, O}.\n\nLet\'s list the remaining common letters. The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have excluded 6 letters (C, R, A, S, T, O). So we have 20 letters left.\n\nBut we should focus on common letters that appear in 5-letter words.\n\nCommon consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\nVowels left: I, U, Y (since A, E, O are either absent or already placed; E is placed at the end, but note that E might appear elsewhere? However, we don\'t know. The feedback only tells us about the E at the 5th position. It could be that there is another E? But we haven\'t tested for that. Similarly, for N, we only know about the one at the 4th position.)\n\nBut note: in the feedback, for ""crane"", E was marked as correct and in position, but that doesn\'t prevent the word from having another E. Similarly for ""stone"", E was again marked correct. However, we haven\'t tested for duplicate E. But since we are only required to form a word with the pattern, we can consider the possibility.\n\nBut to be efficient, we should try to use a word that tests new letters and also might reveal if there are duplicates.\n\nHowever, we have limited guesses (only 4 left). We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nWe know the word ends with ""NE"". We need to guess the first three letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that end with ""NE"" and do not contain C, R, A, S, T, O.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- ""PHONE"": but O is in it, and we know O is absent (from the second guess: O(x)). So invalid.\n- ""SHINE"": S is absent (from second guess: S(x)), so invalid.\n- ""THINE"": T is absent (from second guess: T(x)), so invalid.\n- ""ALONE"": A is absent (from first guess: A(x)) and O is absent, so invalid.\n- ""BRINE"": B, R, I, N, E -> but R is absent (from first guess: R(x)), so invalid.\n- ""PRUNE"": P, R, U, N, E -> R is absent, invalid.\n- ""PLANE"": P, L, A, N, E -> A is absent, invalid.\n- ""DWINE"": D, W, I, N, E -> but is ""dwine"" a word? It might be archaic. We need common words.\n- ""WHINE"": W, H, I, N, E -> but W, H, I are not excluded? Let\'s check: we haven\'t used W, H, I. And it doesn\'t contain C, R, A, S, T, O. So ""WHINE"" is a candidate.\n\nBut wait, is ""WHINE"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to complain.\n\nOther candidates:\n- ""SHINE"" is invalid because of S.\n- ""THINE"" is invalid because of T.\n- ""QUINE"": Q, U, I, N, E -> not a common word? ""Quine"" is a proper name or a term in philosophy, but might not be in the word list.\n- ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> R is absent, invalid.\n- ""OPINE"": O is absent, invalid.\n\nSo ""WHINE"" seems a candidate. But let\'s see if there are others.\n\n- ""ALINE"": A is absent, invalid.\n- ""KNEAD"": but doesn\'t end with NE? It ends with EAD. We need ...NE.\n- ""MINCE"": but ends with CE, and C is absent. Invalid.\n\nAnother one: ""DIANE""? But that\'s a name and it ends with E? Actually, ""DIANE"" is 5 letters: D-I-A-N-E. But A is absent, so invalid.\n\n""BINGE"": B, I, N, G, E -> but N is at the 3rd position? We need N at the 4th. So the pattern must be _ _ _ N E, so the third letter must be the one before N. In ""BINGE"", the 4th letter is G, not N. So invalid.\n\nWe must have the 4th letter as N and 5th as E. So the word must be of the form: X Y Z N E.\n\nSo we need words where the first three letters are from the remaining alphabet and form a valid word with ""NE"" at the end.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\n- ""WHINE"": W H I N E -> positions: W(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). This is valid and uses W, H, I.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- ""SHINE"": invalid because of S.\n- ""THINE"": invalid because of T.\n- ""PHONE"": invalid because of O.\n- ""PRUNE"": invalid because of R.\n- ""BRINE"": invalid because of R and also B? B is not excluded, but R is. So invalid.\n- ""TRINE"": T and R, both excluded.\n- ""DWINE"": D W I N E -> is this a word? It might be an old word for waste away, but not common. We should avoid if possible.\n- ""SWINE"": S is excluded, invalid.\n- ""TWINE"": T is excluded, invalid.\n\nWhat about ""URINE""? U R I N E -> R is excluded.\n\n""QUEUE"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""PIQUE"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""BULGE"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""PURGE"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> but then the 4th letter is G, not N. So invalid.\n\n""MANGE"": M A N G E -> A is excluded, and also the 4th letter is G, not N. Invalid.\n\n""RANGE"": R and A excluded.\n\n""BINGE"": as above, 4th letter is G.\n\nWe need the 4th letter to be N. So the third letter must be the one that comes before N and E.\n\nAnother candidate: ""WINCE"": W I N C E -> but C is excluded (from first guess: C(x)), and also the 4th letter is C, not N? Wait, ""WINCE"" is W(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). So the N is at position 3, not 4. We need N at position 4. So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""DANCE"": D A N C E -> A and C excluded, and N is at position 3? D(1), A(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). So N is at 3, not 4. Invalid.\n\nWe need the N to be at the 4th position. So the word must be ? ? ? N E.\n\nThe third letter must be a consonant or vowel that can come before N.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""ALONE"": invalid (A and O excluded)\n- ""PHONE"": invalid (O excluded)\n- ""STONE"": invalid (we already tried and it had S,T,O excluded)\n- ""SHINE"": invalid (S excluded)\n- ""THINE"": invalid (T excluded)\n\nLess common:\n- ""WHINE"": as above, valid and uses W, H, I.\n- ""DWINE"": if accepted, D, W, I, N, E.\n- ""TWINE"": T excluded.\n\nAnother one: ""OPINE"": O excluded.\n\n""ELUDE"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""EXILE"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""ADOBE"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\nWe might have to consider ""WHINE"" as a candidate. But note, we are making a guess to get information, not necessarily the answer.\n\nWe have 4 guesses left. We can use this guess to test multiple new letters.\n\nWe know the word is ? ? ? N E, and the missing letters are from the set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C, R, A, S, T, O).\n\nWe should try a word that uses common letters from this set to maximize information.\n\nFor example, H, I, L, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nBut we are constrained by the word needing to end with ""NE"". So we must have a word of the form XYZNE.\n\nWe can try ""WHINE"" to test W, H, I.\n\nBut note: if we guess ""WHINE"", and it\'s not the word, we might get feedback that tells us about W, H, I.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has a different set of letters, such as including U or P.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word like ""PURGE""? No, doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""PRUNE"": has R, excluded.\n\n""PLUME"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""BLUFF"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""JUICE"": doesn\'t end with NE, and C excluded.\n\n""QUILL"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""QUINE"": as I thought earlier, it might not be in the word list. But let\'s assume we stick to common words.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BEIGE"": B, E, I, G, E -> but the 4th letter is G, not N. And it has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if E is duplicated. However, the pattern requires N at 4th. So invalid.\n\n""DEIGN"": D, E, I, G, N -> ends with GN, not NE. Invalid.\n\n""FEIGN"": F, E, I, G, N -> same, ends with GN.\n\n""REIGN"": R excluded.\n\n""VEIN"": only 4 letters.\n\n""VEINE""? Not a word.\n\n""PIED"": not 5 letters.\n\nWe might be missing some words. Let me think of common words ending with ""INE"", ""UNE"", etc.\n\nFor ""INE"":\n- ""AINE"": not common, and A excluded.\n- ""BINE"": not common? (as in woodbine, but that\'s 8 letters) \n- ""DINE"": D, I, N, E -> but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So ""DINE"" is 4.\n- ""FINE"": F, I, N, E -> 4 letters.\n- ""KINE"": K, I, N, E -> 4 letters (archaic for cows).\n- ""LINE"": L, I, N, E -> 4 letters.\n- ""MINE"": M, I, N, E -> 4 letters.\n- ""NINE"": N, I, N, E -> but N at position 1 and 3? We need 5 letters. ""NINE"" is 4.\n- ""PINE"": P, I, N, E -> 4 letters.\n- ""SINE"": S excluded, and 4 letters.\n- ""TINE"": T excluded, 4 letters.\n- ""VINE"": V, I, N, E -> 4 letters.\n- ""WINE"": W, I, N, E -> 4 letters.\n\nBut we need 5 letters. So we need words that have 5 letters and end with ""INE"". \n\n5-letter words ending with ""INE"":\n- ""ALINE"": A excluded.\n- ""CANINE"": 6 letters.\n- ""FELINE"": 6 letters.\n- ""OPINE"": O excluded.\n- ""PRUNE"": R excluded, and ends with UNE, not INE.\n- ""TRINE"": T and R excluded.\n- ""URINE"": R excluded.\n- ""WHINE"": W, H, I, N, E -> 5 letters. This is one.\n\nAnother one: ""SHINE"": S excluded.\n\n""THINE"": T excluded.\n\n""DWINE"": D, W, I, N, E -> 5 letters. It is a word (to waste away, or Scottish for decline). But it\'s not very common.\n\n""TWINE"": T excluded.\n\n""QUINE"": Q, U, I, N, E -> 5 letters. It is a surname and a term in logic, but might be accepted in some word lists. However, in Wordle, they use common words.\n\nAnother one: ""BRINE"": B, R, I, N, E -> R excluded.\n\n""CRINE"": C, R, I, N, E -> C and R excluded, and it\'s not common.\n\n""DRINE"": not a word.\n\n""GRINE"": not common.\n\n""PRINE"": not common.\n\n""TRINE"": already considered.\n\nSo the only common 5-letter word ending with ""INE"" that doesn\'t use excluded letters is ""WHINE"".\n\nWhat about ending with ""UNE""? \n- ""PRUNE"": R excluded.\n- ""TRUNE"": not a word.\n- ""DUNE"": D, U, N, E -> 4 letters.\n\n5-letter words ending with ""UNE"": \n- ""FORTUNE"": 7 letters.\n- ""TUNE"": 4 letters.\n- ""JUNE"": 4 letters.\n- ""RUNE"": 4 letters.\n\nNo common 5-letter words ending with ""UNE"".\n\nEnding with ""YNE"": \n- ""BYNE"": not a word.\n- ""EYNE"": archaic for eyes, 4 letters.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nEnding with ""ON E"": but O is excluded.\n\nSo ""WHINE"" seems the best candidate.\n\nBut note: we have the possibility of the word having duplicate letters? For example, could the word have two E\'s? We know E is at the end, but maybe also at the beginning or middle? We haven\'t tested that.\n\nSimilarly, for N, we know one at position 4, but maybe another?\n\nBut in ""WHINE"", we are testing W, H, I, and also we are putting E at the end, which we know is correct. If the word has an E elsewhere, we might not know.\n\nBut we are constrained by the word pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we could guess a word that doesn\'t have E at the end to test for duplicate E? But we know E is at the end, and if we don\'t put E at the end, we might get a \'-\' if there is another E, but we are required to have the pattern? No, we are not required, but we know the 4th and 5th letters are fixed. So we should use that to our advantage.\n\nBut to test for duplicate E, we could put an E in another position. However, we have only 4 guesses left, and we know two positions, so it might be better to focus on the first three.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess a word that has E in the first position, for example, and N in the fourth and E in the fifth, then if there is an E in the first, we would get a \'-\' for the first position. But we don\'t know if that E is the same as the fifth or a duplicate.\n\nBut we can try.\n\nHowever, we are limited by the available words.\n\nAnother candidate: ""EVENT"": but doesn\'t end with NE, and T is excluded.\n\n""EXILE"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""ELIDE"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""EMBED"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a 5-letter word that ends with NE and has E in the first position and avoids the excluded letters.\n\nFor example, ""EERIE"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""ELATE"": A excluded.\n\nSo probably not.\n\nTherefore, I think ""WHINE"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we have not used the letters D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nIn ""WHINE"", we are testing W, H, I.\n\nIf we get feedback that W is absent, H is absent, I is absent, then we know the word must be something else with other letters.\n\nBut if we get a correct or misplaced, we get information.\n\nAlternatively, we could guess a word that uses more common letters like L, D, U.\n\nFor example, ""DUVET"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""PULSE"": S excluded.\n\n""LUNGE"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""MIDGE"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""BADGE"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\nIt\'s very difficult to find a word that fits the pattern and tests more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""HINGE"": H, I, N, G, E -> but the 4th letter is G, not N. So invalid.\n\n""MINCE"": M, I, N, C, E -> C excluded, and N is at position 3? M(1), I(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). So N is at 3, not 4. Invalid.\n\n""WINDY"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\n""WIELD"": doesn\'t end with NE.\n\nSo I think ""WHINE"" is the best we can do.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""WHINE"".\n\nBut note: we have feedback that in the first guess, A was absent, and in the second, O was absent, so we are safe.\n\nSo the guess is ""WHINE"".\n\nBut let\'s double-check the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""PHONE"" but we know O is absent, so not.\n\nOr if the word is ""SHINE"", but S is absent.\n\nSo ""WHINE"" is a valid guess.\n\nWe\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, A are absent (x), N is correct and in position 4 (✓), E is correct and in position 5 (✓).\n- **Guess 2 (stone)**: S, T, O are absent (x), N is correct and in position 4 (✓), E is correct and in position 5 (✓).\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has the pattern `_ _ _ N E` (N in position 4, E in position 5).\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, O (cannot appear in the word).\n- Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- The goal is to test new common letters (e.g., H, I, W, D, L) to gather information about positions 1–3.\n\n### Analysis for the Next Guess:\n- We need a 5-letter word ending in ""NE"" that avoids C, R, A, S, T, O.\n- After evaluating options (e.g., ""shine"" invalid due to S, ""thine"" invalid due to T, ""phone"" invalid due to O), the strongest candidate is **""WHINE""**:\n  - Uses new common letters: W (position 1), H (position 2), I (position 3).\n  - Tests for possible vowels (I) and consonants (W, H) in the unknown positions.\n  - If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the possibilities significantly (e.g., revealing if W, H, or I are present or absent).\n\n<guess>whine</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stone -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) N(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 3: whine -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) I(x) N(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(✓)
Guess 2: ""stone"" -> S(x), T(x), O(x), N(✓), E(✓)
Guess 3: ""whine"" -> W(x), H(x), I(x), N(✓), E(✓)

From this, we know:
- The word is of the form: _ _ _ N E
- The following letters are absent: C, R, A, S, T, O, W, H, I
- The letters N and E are present and in the correct positions (4 and 5).

We need to find a 5-letter word ending with ""NE"" that does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, O, W, H, I.

The remaining letters available are: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We must form a word: [letter1][letter2][letter3] N E, where letter1, letter2, letter3 are from the remaining set.

Let's try to think of words that fit this pattern.

Common words ending with ""NE"" that might use the remaining letters:

- ""PURNE"": Not a word.
- ""BURNE"": Not common.
- ""DOWNE"": Not 5 letters? ""Down"" is 4, ""downed"" is 5 but ends with D.
- ""GIVEN"": But ""GIVEN"" is G I V E N, which has I (excluded) and N is at position 5? We need N at position 4 and E at 5. In ""GIVEN"", the 4th letter is E and 5th is N, so it doesn't fit.

We need the 4th to be N and 5th to be E, so the word must be X Y Z N E.

Possible words:

- ""DUNCE"": But C is excluded, and D U N C E -> 4th letter is C? D(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). But we need N at 4, so invalid pattern.

We need the N to be the 4th letter, so the third letter must be the one that comes before N.

For example:
- ""BENCH"": Doesn't end with NE.
- ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). Here, N is at position 3, not 4. So the 4th letter is G, which is not N. Invalid.

We need a word where the 4th letter is N. So the first three letters are the first three, then N, then E.

Let me search for words that end with ""NE"" and have N as the fourth letter.

Some possibilities from the English language:

- ""ALONE"": But A and O excluded.
- ""PHONE"": O excluded.
- ""STONE"": S, T, O excluded.
- ""SHINE"": S excluded.
- ""THINE"": T excluded.
- ""WHINE"": W, H, I excluded.
- ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> R and I excluded.
- ""PRUNE"": P, R, U, N, E -> R excluded.
- ""BRINE"": B, R, I, N, E -> R and I excluded.
- ""TRINE"": T, R, I excluded.
- ""DWINE"": D, W, I, N, E -> W and I excluded (from guess 3: W(x), I(x)).
- ""OPINE"": O excluded.

Now, with the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a word: [B/D/F/G/J/K/L/M/P/Q/U/V/X/Y/Z] [same] [same] N E

Let's try:

- ""PURE"": 4 letters.
- ""PURNE"": Not a word.
- ""BUNCE"": Not common, and if B U N C E, C excluded.
- ""DANCE"": D A N C E -> A and C excluded.
- ""FENCE"": F E N C E -> C excluded, and E is at position 2 and 5? But we know E is at 5, but if there is another E, it might be allowed. However, in ""FENCE"", the 4th letter is C (excluded) and 2nd is E. But we need the 4th to be N. Pattern: F(1) E(2) N(3) C(4) E(5) -> N is at 3, not 4. Invalid.

Another idea: ""MANGE"": M A N G E -> A excluded, and N at 3.

""RANGE"": R and A excluded.

""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> N at 3.

""MINCE"": M I N C E -> I and C excluded, N at 3.

""VINCE"": V I N C E -> I and C excluded.

""PINCE"": Not common.

""JUNGE"": Not a word.

""KINDE"": Archaic spelling of kind, but K I N D E -> N at 3, and ends with DE, not NE? ""KINDE"" is K(1) I(2) N(3) D(4) E(5) -> 4th is D, not N.

We need the 4th to be N.

Perhaps ""LYNNE"": But that's a name, L Y N N E -> L(1) Y(2) N(3) N(4) E(5). Oh! Here, the 4th letter is N and 5th is E. And it has two N's.

But is ""LYNNE"" a valid word? It might be considered a proper name, but in Wordle, sometimes names are allowed if they are common. Alternatively, ""LYNNE"" could be a variant of ""lynn"", but typically not used as a common noun.

Another one: ""DONNE"": D O N N E -> O excluded.

""BUNNE"": Not a word.

""GUNNE"": Not a word.

""FUNNE"": Not a word.

""PUNNE"": Not a word.

""RUNNE"": R excluded.

""TUNNE"": T excluded.

""VINNE"": Not a word.

""WINNE"": W excluded.

""MINNE"": Not common.

""PINNE"": Not a word.

""LINNE"": Not common.

""BENNE"": B E N N E -> B(1) E(2) N(3) N(4) E(5). Here, the 4th letter is N and 5th is E. And it is a word: ""benne"" is a plant (sesame).

But ""benne"" has E at position 2, which we haven't tested. And it has two N's and two E's.

But we know E is at position 5, and if there is another E at position 2, that might be possible.

Also, the letters: B, E, N, N, E. We know N is at position 4, and E at 5. The first three letters are B, E, N.

But we have not tested B or E in other positions.

However, in the feedback so far, for ""crane"", E was at position 5 and correct, but we don't know about other E's. Similarly, for ""stone"" and ""whine"", E was at 5 and correct.

In ""benne"", there is an E at position 2. If we guess ""benne"", we can test for that.

But we are constrained by the absent letters: we must avoid C, R, A, S, T, O, W, H, I.

""benne"" uses B, E, N, E. None of these are in the excluded list, except that E and N are already known but not excluded for duplication.

So ""benne"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""DENNE"": Not common.

""JENNE"": Name.

""KENNE"": Not common.

""PENNE"": P E N N E -> P(1) E(2) N(3) N(4) E(5). ""Penne"" is a type of pasta. This is a common word.

Letters: P, E, N, N, E. Avoids excluded letters: no C, R, A, S, T, O, W, H, I.

So ""PENNE"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""BENNE"" is also valid.

Other possibilities: ""FINNE""? Not common.

""GINNE"": Not a word.

""MINNE"": Not common.

""VINNE"": Not common.

""LINNE"": Not common.

""RUNNE"": R excluded.

So the two main candidates are ""PENNE"" and ""BENNE"".

We can choose one of them.

But note: we have not used P or B yet, so we can test one of them.

We can choose ""PENNE"" because it is a very common word.

In ""PENNE"", we are testing:
- P at position 1
- E at position 2 (we know E is at 5, but not if it appears elsewhere)
- N at position 3 (we know N is at 4, but not if it appears elsewhere)

If the word is ""PENNE"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on P, E, and the third N.

But we know the 4th and 5th are N and E, so they will be correct.

So let's guess ""PENNE"".

But we must consider: if the word is not ""PENNE"", we might get:

- P could be absent, or present but in wrong position, etc.

But it's a good way to test.

Alternatively, we could guess a word with completely new letters to maximize information, but it's hard because we have to fit the pattern.

For example, ""MUDGE"": doesn't end with NE.

""PLUME"": doesn't end with NE.

""FLUKE"": doesn't end with NE.

So ""PENNE"" seems a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""PENNE"".

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Pattern from Previous Feedback**:
   - The secret word ends with ""NE"" (positions 4 and 5 are confirmed as N and E).
   - Absent letters (from all guesses): C, R, A, S, T, O, W, H, I (marked ""x"" in feedback).
   - Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.
   - The word pattern is: `_ _ _ N E`.

2. **Constraints for the Next Guess**:
   - Must be a 5-letter word ending in ""NE"".
   - Cannot contain any absent letters (C, R, A, S, T, O, W, H, I).
   - Should test new high-frequency letters from the remaining set to gather information about positions 1–3.

3. **Evaluating Possible Words**:
   - Common words like ""phone"" (O excluded), ""shine"" (S excluded), ""whine"" (W, H, I excluded), and ""urine"" (R, I excluded) are invalid.
   - After filtering, valid candidates include:
     - **""PENNE""**: A common word (type of pasta). Uses P (new), E (known but testing for duplication), and N (known but testing for duplication). Pattern: P E N N E.
     - **""BENNE""**: Less common (sesame plant). Uses B (new), E (known), and N (known).
   - ""PENNE"" is preferred because:
     - Tests P (high-frequency consonant) and checks for duplicate E/N.
     - If incorrect, feedback on P and the E/N positions will significantly narrow possibilities (e.g., revealing if P is present or if E/N appear elsewhere).

4. **Why Not Other Words?**:
   - Words like ""lynne"" (proper name, less common) or ""dunce"" (C excluded) are invalid.
   - No other common 5-letter words ending in ""NE"" fit the constraints (e.g., ""prune"" has R, ""dwine"" has W/I).

5. **Strategy**:
   - Guess ""PENNE"" to test new letters (P) and potential duplicates (E, N) efficiently.
   - If ""PENNE"" is correct, the game ends. If not, feedback will clarify position 1 (P), position 2 (E), and position 3 (N), reducing the solution space.

<guess>penne</guess>",penne,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(✓)
Guess 2: ""stone"" -> S(x), T(x), O(x), N(✓), E(✓)
Guess 3: ""whine"" -> W(x), H(x), I(x), N(✓), E(✓)

From this, we know:
- The word is of the form: _ _ _ N E
- The following letters are absent: C, R, A, S, T, O, W, H, I
- The letters N and E are present and in the correct positions (4 and 5).

We need to find a 5-letter word ending with ""NE"" that does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, O, W, H, I.

The remaining letters available are: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We must form a word: [letter1][letter2][letter3] N E, where letter1, letter2, letter3 are from the remaining set.

Let's try to think of words that fit this pattern.

Common words ending with ""NE"" that might use the remaining letters:

- ""PURNE"": Not a word.
- ""BURNE"": Not common.
- ""DOWNE"": Not 5 letters? ""Down"" is 4, ""downed"" is 5 but ends with D.
- ""GIVEN"": But ""GIVEN"" is G I V E N, which has I (excluded) and N is at position 5? We need N at position 4 and E at 5. In ""GIVEN"", the 4th letter is E and 5th is N, so it doesn't fit.

We need the 4th to be N and 5th to be E, so the word must be X Y Z N E.

Possible words:

- ""DUNCE"": But C is excluded, and D U N C E -> 4th letter is C? D(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), E(5). But we need N at 4, so invalid pattern.

We need the N to be the 4th letter, so the third letter must be the one that comes before N.

For example:
- ""BENCH"": Doesn't end with NE.
- ""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> L(1), U(2), N(3), G(4), E(5). Here, N is at position 3, not 4. So the 4th letter is G, which is not N. Invalid.

We need a word where the 4th letter is N. So the first three letters are the first three, then N, then E.

Let me search for words that end with ""NE"" and have N as the fourth letter.

Some possibilities from the English language:

- ""ALONE"": But A and O excluded.
- ""PHONE"": O excluded.
- ""STONE"": S, T, O excluded.
- ""SHINE"": S excluded.
- ""THINE"": T excluded.
- ""WHINE"": W, H, I excluded.
- ""URINE"": U, R, I, N, E -> R and I excluded.
- ""PRUNE"": P, R, U, N, E -> R excluded.
- ""BRINE"": B, R, I, N, E -> R and I excluded.
- ""TRINE"": T, R, I excluded.
- ""DWINE"": D, W, I, N, E -> W and I excluded (from guess 3: W(x), I(x)).
- ""OPINE"": O excluded.

Now, with the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a word: [B/D/F/G/J/K/L/M/P/Q/U/V/X/Y/Z] [same] [same] N E

Let's try:

- ""PURE"": 4 letters.
- ""PURNE"": Not a word.
- ""BUNCE"": Not common, and if B U N C E, C excluded.
- ""DANCE"": D A N C E -> A and C excluded.
- ""FENCE"": F E N C E -> C excluded, and E is at position 2 and 5? But we know E is at 5, but if there is another E, it might be allowed. However, in ""FENCE"", the 4th letter is C (excluded) and 2nd is E. But we need the 4th to be N. Pattern: F(1) E(2) N(3) C(4) E(5) -> N is at 3, not 4. Invalid.

Another idea: ""MANGE"": M A N G E -> A excluded, and N at 3.

""RANGE"": R and A excluded.

""LUNGE"": L U N G E -> N at 3.

""MINCE"": M I N C E -> I and C excluded, N at 3.

""VINCE"": V I N C E -> I and C excluded.

""PINCE"": Not common.

""JUNGE"": Not a word.

""KINDE"": Archaic spelling of kind, but K I N D E -> N at 3, and ends with DE, not NE? ""KINDE"" is K(1) I(2) N(3) D(4) E(5) -> 4th is D, not N.

We need the 4th to be N.

Perhaps ""LYNNE"": But that's a name, L Y N N E -> L(1) Y(2) N(3) N(4) E(5). Oh! Here, the 4th letter is N and 5th is E. And it has two N's.

But is ""LYNNE"" a valid word? It might be considered a proper name, but in Wordle, sometimes names are allowed if they are common. Alternatively, ""LYNNE"" could be a variant of ""lynn"", but typically not used as a common noun.

Another one: ""DONNE"": D O N N E -> O excluded.

""BUNNE"": Not a word.

""GUNNE"": Not a word.

""FUNNE"": Not a word.

""PUNNE"": Not a word.

""RUNNE"": R excluded.

""TUNNE"": T excluded.

""VINNE"": Not a word.

""WINNE"": W excluded.

""MINNE"": Not common.

""PINNE"": Not a word.

""LINNE"": Not common.

""BENNE"": B E N N E -> B(1) E(2) N(3) N(4) E(5). Here, the 4th letter is N and 5th is E. And it is a word: ""benne"" is a plant (sesame).

But ""benne"" has E at position 2, which we haven't tested. And it has two N's and two E's.

But we know E is at position 5, and if there is another E at position 2, that might be possible.

Also, the letters: B, E, N, N, E. We know N is at position 4, and E at 5. The first three letters are B, E, N.

But we have not tested B or E in other positions.

However, in the feedback so far, for ""crane"", E was at position 5 and correct, but we don't know about other E's. Similarly, for ""stone"" and ""whine"", E was at 5 and correct.

In ""benne"", there is an E at position 2. If we guess ""benne"", we can test for that.

But we are constrained by the absent letters: we must avoid C, R, A, S, T, O, W, H, I.

""benne"" uses B, E, N, E. None of these are in the excluded list, except that E and N are already known but not excluded for duplication.

So ""benne"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""DENNE"": Not common.

""JENNE"": Name.

""KENNE"": Not common.

""PENNE"": P E N N E -> P(1) E(2) N(3) N(4) E(5). ""Penne"" is a type of pasta. This is a common word.

Letters: P, E, N, N, E. Avoids excluded letters: no C, R, A, S, T, O, W, H, I.

So ""PENNE"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""BENNE"" is also valid.

Other possibilities: ""FINNE""? Not common.

""GINNE"": Not a word.

""MINNE"": Not common.

""VINNE"": Not common.

""LINNE"": Not common.

""RUNNE"": R excluded.

So the two main candidates are ""PENNE"" and ""BENNE"".

We can choose one of them.

But note: we have not used P or B yet, so we can test one of them.

We can choose ""PENNE"" because it is a very common word.

In ""PENNE"", we are testing:
- P at position 1
- E at position 2 (we know E is at 5, but not if it appears elsewhere)
- N at position 3 (we know N is at 4, but not if it appears elsewhere)

If the word is ""PENNE"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on P, E, and the third N.

But we know the 4th and 5th are N and E, so they will be correct.

So let's guess ""PENNE"".

But we must consider: if the word is not ""PENNE"", we might get:

- P could be absent, or present but in wrong position, etc.

But it's a good way to test.

Alternatively, we could guess a word with completely new letters to maximize information, but it's hard because we have to fit the pattern.

For example, ""MUDGE"": doesn't end with NE.

""PLUME"": doesn't end with NE.

""FLUKE"": doesn't end with NE.

So ""PENNE"" seems a good guess.
