We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
This means:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- N is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E is not in the secret word.

So, the secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they were guessed.
In ""crane"", A was the 3rd letter (position 3) and N was the 4th letter (position 4). Therefore, A must be in position 1, 2, or 5? Actually, positions are 1-indexed? 
But note: the word is 5 letters. Positions: 1:c, 2:r, 3:a, 4:n, 5:e.

So, A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, N is not at position 4.

Also, C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word does NOT contain: C, R, E.
It DOES contain A and N, but A is not at position 3, and N is not at position 4.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Is a 5-letter English word.
- Does not contain C, R, E (since they are absent).
- Must contain A and N (because we know they are present).
- But A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4.

Also, we have two known correct letters? No, we don't have any in the correct position yet.

We have two letters that are present but in the wrong position: A and N.

So, our new guess should include A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

Moreover, we might want to try other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible letters: we can use other common consonants and vowels.

Vowels: we have A already, and we don't have O, I, U yet? But E is out.

Consonants: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (avoiding C, R, E).

We also know that A must be placed in position 1,2,4, or 5? But not 3. Similarly, N must be placed in position 1,2,3, or 5? Not 4.

Let me list possible positions for A: since it's not in position 3, it can be in 1,2,4,5.
Similarly, N: not in position 4, so it can be in 1,2,3,5.

Now, I need a word that has both A and N.

Let me try to think of common words.

Option: ""plant"" - but L and T might be good, and check if it contains forbidden letters: no C,R,E. Also, positions: 
P L A N T -> A is at position 3? But we cannot put A in position 3 because feedback said A is not in position 3. Therefore, ""plant"" would have A in position 3 -> invalid for A? Actually, A must be moved.

So, we need a word where A is not at position 3 and N is not at position 4.

Another word: ""stand"" - S T A N D -> A at position 3: which is not allowed because A cannot be in position 3.

Another: ""thank"" - T H A N K -> A is position 3 -> again not allowed.

We must avoid position 3 for A.

So, words where A is at position 1,2,4,5.

Similarly, N must not be at position 4.

What words have A and N?

Try A at position 1: ""angel"" -> A N G E L -> but E is forbidden (we know E is not in the word). So no.

A at position 1: ""ankle"" -> E is forbidden.

A at position 1: ""anvil"" -> A N V I L -> has N at position 2? Also, it avoids C,R,E. Let's check: A(1), N(2), V(3), I(4), L(5). 
In this case, A is at position 1 (allowed), N is at position 2 (allowed, since N can be at 2). 
But what about the feedback? We don't know if these are correct yet.

We also want to test other letters.

Maybe ""adorn""? But R is forbidden -> no.

Another possibility: A at position 2: for example, ""saint"" -> S A I N T -> A at position 2 (allowed), N at position 4? But we cannot have N at position 4 because feedback said N is not at position 4? Actually, the feedback was for the first guess: in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and it was wrong. So N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, in ""saint"", N is at position 4 -> this would be invalid because we know N is not at position 4.

We must avoid putting N at position 4 in our next guess.

In ""saint"", N is at position 4 -> avoid.

Similarly, we must avoid A at position 3.

So, let's try A at position 2 and N at position 5? For example: ""train"" -> T R A I N -> but R is forbidden -> no.

A at position 2: ""plain"" -> P L A I N -> A at position 3? No, plain: P(1), L(2), A(3) -> A at position 3 -> not allowed.

A at position 4: for example, ""urban"" -> U R B A N -> R is forbidden -> no.

A at position 5: ""woman"" -> W O M A N -> A at position 4? Let's index: 1:W, 2:O, 3:M, 4:A, 5:N -> so A is at 4 (allowed? A can be at 4) and N at 5 (allowed? N can be at 5). Also, no C,R,E.

So ""woman"" is a candidate: letters W, O, M, A, N.

But we are not sure. We could also try ""human"": H U M A N -> 1:H, 2:U, 3:M, 4:A, 5:N -> same positions for A and N.

But maybe we can choose a word that includes more common letters? We haven't tried S, T, L, etc.

Another candidate: A at position 5 and N at position 1? ""nasty"" -> N A S T Y -> N at position 1 (allowed), A at position 2 (allowed). But note: in ""nasty"", A is at position 2 and N at position 1? Let me write: 
Position 1: N, 2: A, 3: S, 4: T, 5: Y.
This avoids position 3 for A? A is at 2 -> allowed. N is at 1 -> allowed. And no C,R,E.

But note: we know A is present and N is present, and we are putting them in new positions.

""nasty"" might be good because it also includes S and T, common letters.

What about ""piano""? P I A N O -> A at position 3 -> not allowed.

Or ""lanes"" -> L A N E S -> E is forbidden -> no.

Let's think of words with A and N that don't put A at pos3 or N at pos4, and avoid C,R,E.

Some words:
- ""sandy"": S A N D Y -> A at pos2, N at pos3 -> allowed? A not at3? A is at2 -> allowed. N not at4? N is at3 -> allowed. Letters: S, A, N, D, Y. No C,R,E.
- ""manly"": M A N L Y -> A at2, N at3 -> allowed.
- ""panel"": P A N E L -> E forbidden -> no.

Another: ""fauna"" -> F A U N A -> A at position 2 and 5? But we have duplicate letters? We don't know if the secret word has duplicates. Also, A at2 is allowed? And N at position 4? But we cannot put N at position 4, so ""fauna"" has N at position 4 -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""banal"": B A N A L -> A at2 and4? N at3? Okay: positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L -> A at2 allowed? And A at4 allowed? But N at3: that is allowed? Since N can be at3. However, we are using two A's? Might not be efficient.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicates, but it's possible.

To maximize information, perhaps we should use distinct letters? Since we don't know.

But in our first guess ""crane"", we had distinct letters.

For second guess, we can try distinct.

So let's go with ""sandy"": 
- S at1, A at2, N at3, D at4, Y at5.

This uses A and N, avoids forbidden letters, and A is not at3? It's at2 -> okay. N at3 -> okay (not the forbidden position which was 4).

Similarly, ""sally"" is not 5 letters? ""Sandy"" is 5.

But we also have ""handy"": H A N D Y -> same positions: A2, N3. Does it include H and D? Which we haven't tested.

But we don't know that H and D are in the word? We are trying to test.

Perhaps we should try to put A in a position we haven't tested? Specifically, in the first guess we had A at3 and N at4. Now we need to move them.

We know A is not at3, so we try A at another position: say position 1? But earlier we had trouble.

What about ""again""? A G G A I -> double G? And we don't know about G and I. Also, A at1 and4? But N? We need to have N.

We must include N.

So words with A and N: are there words with A at position 5?

""wagon"": W A G O N -> has O, but note: W(1), A(2), G(3), O(4), N(5). A at2, N at5 -> allowed? Avoid forbidden: C,R,E? It has W,A,G,O,N -> no forbidden letters.

But A at position2 -> same as in ""sandy""? Or we can vary.

To get different positions, we could try A at position1: 
""ankhs""? Not common. ""angst"": A N G S T -> A(1), N(2), G(3), S(4), T(5). So A at1, N at2 -> allowed? And avoids C,R,E.

Also, letters: A, N, G, S, T -> all common.

So ""angst"": positions: 
1: A (not in position that was forbidden? But forbidden for A was only position3? So A at1 is fine)
2: N (not forbidden position4? So at2 is fine)
Then G, S, T: which are new.

Similarly, we can get information about S, T, etc.

Alternatively, ""adult"": A D U L T -> but no N.

We must include N.

So between ""sandy"" and ""angst"", I think ""angst"" might be better because it places A at a new position (1) and N at2 (instead of3). Also, it uses more common letters: S, T, G.

Let me compare:
- ""sandy"": S, A, N, D, Y -> letters: S, A, N, D, Y. We already know A and N are in the word, so we are testing S, D, Y.
- ""angst"": A, N, G, S, T -> testing G, S, T.

Since we have only green for A and N? Actually, they are yellow, meaning they are in wrong positions.

We are to choose a word that has A and N in positions that are not 3 and 4 respectively? That's minimal, but we also want to cover other common letters.

Another word: ""paint"". P A I N T -> A at2, N at4? But we cannot have N at4 -> avoid.

""taint"": T A I N T -> A at2, N at4 -> not allowed.

""lying"": L Y I N G -> no A.

I think ""angst"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: 
Guess: ""angst""
- If A is in the word but not at position1? We know A is in the word, so if we get A(✓), that would be great. Otherwise, if we get A(-), then we know it's not at1. Similarly for N at position2.

But by putting A at1 and N at2, we are testing positions that we haven't tried before? Actually, in the first guess, we didn't have A at1 or N at2? We had A at3 and N at4.

So we are moving them.

Moreover, G at3, S at4, T at5.

We might get information about G, S, T.

So I think ""angst"" is a good guess.

What about ""basin"": B A S I N -> A at2, N at5? But we must check: positions: 1:B,2:A,3:S,4:I,5:N -> so A at2 (allowed), N at5 (allowed). Also, letters: B, A, S, I, N. Avoids C,R,E.

We could consider ""latin"": L A T I N -> A at2, N at5 -> same as above? But letters L,A,T,I,N.

I think ""angst"" might be better because it starts with A and N which we know are present, and then G,S,T are common.

Alternatively, ""saint"" we ruled out because N at4 is forbidden.

Another word: ""daunt"": D A U N T -> A at2, N at4 -> N at4 is forbidden -> no.

""haunt"": same issue.

So I decide to go with ""angst"".

But wait, we have two yellow letters: A and N. So we must include them. Also, avoiding placing A at position3 and N at position4.

In ""angst"": A is at1, which is allowed because only forbidden for A is position3? Actually, the feedback was that A is not at position3 in the word — it could be elsewhere. Similarly, N is at2, not at4.

So it should be valid.

Therefore, I guess ""angst"".

<guess>angst</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

For the next guess, I need a word that:
- Is 5 letters long and a valid English word.
- Includes A and N (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoids C, R, and E (since they are absent).
- Places A in a position other than 3 (so positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Places N in a position other than 4 (so positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).

Additionally, I want to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, G) to maximize information. After considering words like ""sandy"", ""manly"", and ""angst"", I chose ""angst"" because:
- It places A at position 1 and N at position 2 (both allowed positions).
- The letters A and N (which we know are present) are moved to new positions.
- It uses distinct common letters (G, S, T) to probe for additional information.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, E).

This guess will help determine the correct positions for A and N while testing new letters.

<guess>angst</guess>",angst,"We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
This means:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- N is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E is not in the secret word.

So, the secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they were guessed.
In ""crane"", A was the 3rd letter (position 3) and N was the 4th letter (position 4). Therefore, A must be in position 1, 2, or 5? Actually, positions are 1-indexed? 
But note: the word is 5 letters. Positions: 1:c, 2:r, 3:a, 4:n, 5:e.

So, A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, N is not at position 4.

Also, C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word does NOT contain: C, R, E.
It DOES contain A and N, but A is not at position 3, and N is not at position 4.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Is a 5-letter English word.
- Does not contain C, R, E (since they are absent).
- Must contain A and N (because we know they are present).
- But A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4.

Also, we have two known correct letters? No, we don't have any in the correct position yet.

We have two letters that are present but in the wrong position: A and N.

So, our new guess should include A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

Moreover, we might want to try other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible letters: we can use other common consonants and vowels.

Vowels: we have A already, and we don't have O, I, U yet? But E is out.

Consonants: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (avoiding C, R, E).

We also know that A must be placed in position 1,2,4, or 5? But not 3. Similarly, N must be placed in position 1,2,3, or 5? Not 4.

Let me list possible positions for A: since it's not in position 3, it can be in 1,2,4,5.
Similarly, N: not in position 4, so it can be in 1,2,3,5.

Now, I need a word that has both A and N.

Let me try to think of common words.

Option: ""plant"" - but L and T might be good, and check if it contains forbidden letters: no C,R,E. Also, positions: 
P L A N T -> A is at position 3? But we cannot put A in position 3 because feedback said A is not in position 3. Therefore, ""plant"" would have A in position 3 -> invalid for A? Actually, A must be moved.

So, we need a word where A is not at position 3 and N is not at position 4.

Another word: ""stand"" - S T A N D -> A at position 3: which is not allowed because A cannot be in position 3.

Another: ""thank"" - T H A N K -> A is position 3 -> again not allowed.

We must avoid position 3 for A.

So, words where A is at position 1,2,4,5.

Similarly, N must not be at position 4.

What words have A and N?

Try A at position 1: ""angel"" -> A N G E L -> but E is forbidden (we know E is not in the word). So no.

A at position 1: ""ankle"" -> E is forbidden.

A at position 1: ""anvil"" -> A N V I L -> has N at position 2? Also, it avoids C,R,E. Let's check: A(1), N(2), V(3), I(4), L(5). 
In this case, A is at position 1 (allowed), N is at position 2 (allowed, since N can be at 2). 
But what about the feedback? We don't know if these are correct yet.

We also want to test other letters.

Maybe ""adorn""? But R is forbidden -> no.

Another possibility: A at position 2: for example, ""saint"" -> S A I N T -> A at position 2 (allowed), N at position 4? But we cannot have N at position 4 because feedback said N is not at position 4? Actually, the feedback was for the first guess: in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and it was wrong. So N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, in ""saint"", N is at position 4 -> this would be invalid because we know N is not at position 4.

We must avoid putting N at position 4 in our next guess.

In ""saint"", N is at position 4 -> avoid.

Similarly, we must avoid A at position 3.

So, let's try A at position 2 and N at position 5? For example: ""train"" -> T R A I N -> but R is forbidden -> no.

A at position 2: ""plain"" -> P L A I N -> A at position 3? No, plain: P(1), L(2), A(3) -> A at position 3 -> not allowed.

A at position 4: for example, ""urban"" -> U R B A N -> R is forbidden -> no.

A at position 5: ""woman"" -> W O M A N -> A at position 4? Let's index: 1:W, 2:O, 3:M, 4:A, 5:N -> so A is at 4 (allowed? A can be at 4) and N at 5 (allowed? N can be at 5). Also, no C,R,E.

So ""woman"" is a candidate: letters W, O, M, A, N.

But we are not sure. We could also try ""human"": H U M A N -> 1:H, 2:U, 3:M, 4:A, 5:N -> same positions for A and N.

But maybe we can choose a word that includes more common letters? We haven't tried S, T, L, etc.

Another candidate: A at position 5 and N at position 1? ""nasty"" -> N A S T Y -> N at position 1 (allowed), A at position 2 (allowed). But note: in ""nasty"", A is at position 2 and N at position 1? Let me write: 
Position 1: N, 2: A, 3: S, 4: T, 5: Y.
This avoids position 3 for A? A is at 2 -> allowed. N is at 1 -> allowed. And no C,R,E.

But note: we know A is present and N is present, and we are putting them in new positions.

""nasty"" might be good because it also includes S and T, common letters.

What about ""piano""? P I A N O -> A at position 3 -> not allowed.

Or ""lanes"" -> L A N E S -> E is forbidden -> no.

Let's think of words with A and N that don't put A at pos3 or N at pos4, and avoid C,R,E.

Some words:
- ""sandy"": S A N D Y -> A at pos2, N at pos3 -> allowed? A not at3? A is at2 -> allowed. N not at4? N is at3 -> allowed. Letters: S, A, N, D, Y. No C,R,E.
- ""manly"": M A N L Y -> A at2, N at3 -> allowed.
- ""panel"": P A N E L -> E forbidden -> no.

Another: ""fauna"" -> F A U N A -> A at position 2 and 5? But we have duplicate letters? We don't know if the secret word has duplicates. Also, A at2 is allowed? And N at position 4? But we cannot put N at position 4, so ""fauna"" has N at position 4 -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""banal"": B A N A L -> A at2 and4? N at3? Okay: positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L -> A at2 allowed? And A at4 allowed? But N at3: that is allowed? Since N can be at3. However, we are using two A's? Might not be efficient.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicates, but it's possible.

To maximize information, perhaps we should use distinct letters? Since we don't know.

But in our first guess ""crane"", we had distinct letters.

For second guess, we can try distinct.

So let's go with ""sandy"": 
- S at1, A at2, N at3, D at4, Y at5.

This uses A and N, avoids forbidden letters, and A is not at3? It's at2 -> okay. N at3 -> okay (not the forbidden position which was 4).

Similarly, ""sally"" is not 5 letters? ""Sandy"" is 5.

But we also have ""handy"": H A N D Y -> same positions: A2, N3. Does it include H and D? Which we haven't tested.

But we don't know that H and D are in the word? We are trying to test.

Perhaps we should try to put A in a position we haven't tested? Specifically, in the first guess we had A at3 and N at4. Now we need to move them.

We know A is not at3, so we try A at another position: say position 1? But earlier we had trouble.

What about ""again""? A G G A I -> double G? And we don't know about G and I. Also, A at1 and4? But N? We need to have N.

We must include N.

So words with A and N: are there words with A at position 5?

""wagon"": W A G O N -> has O, but note: W(1), A(2), G(3), O(4), N(5). A at2, N at5 -> allowed? Avoid forbidden: C,R,E? It has W,A,G,O,N -> no forbidden letters.

But A at position2 -> same as in ""sandy""? Or we can vary.

To get different positions, we could try A at position1: 
""ankhs""? Not common. ""angst"": A N G S T -> A(1), N(2), G(3), S(4), T(5). So A at1, N at2 -> allowed? And avoids C,R,E.

Also, letters: A, N, G, S, T -> all common.

So ""angst"": positions: 
1: A (not in position that was forbidden? But forbidden for A was only position3? So A at1 is fine)
2: N (not forbidden position4? So at2 is fine)
Then G, S, T: which are new.

Similarly, we can get information about S, T, etc.

Alternatively, ""adult"": A D U L T -> but no N.

We must include N.

So between ""sandy"" and ""angst"", I think ""angst"" might be better because it places A at a new position (1) and N at2 (instead of3). Also, it uses more common letters: S, T, G.

Let me compare:
- ""sandy"": S, A, N, D, Y -> letters: S, A, N, D, Y. We already know A and N are in the word, so we are testing S, D, Y.
- ""angst"": A, N, G, S, T -> testing G, S, T.

Since we have only green for A and N? Actually, they are yellow, meaning they are in wrong positions.

We are to choose a word that has A and N in positions that are not 3 and 4 respectively? That's minimal, but we also want to cover other common letters.

Another word: ""paint"". P A I N T -> A at2, N at4? But we cannot have N at4 -> avoid.

""taint"": T A I N T -> A at2, N at4 -> not allowed.

""lying"": L Y I N G -> no A.

I think ""angst"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: 
Guess: ""angst""
- If A is in the word but not at position1? We know A is in the word, so if we get A(✓), that would be great. Otherwise, if we get A(-), then we know it's not at1. Similarly for N at position2.

But by putting A at1 and N at2, we are testing positions that we haven't tried before? Actually, in the first guess, we didn't have A at1 or N at2? We had A at3 and N at4.

So we are moving them.

Moreover, G at3, S at4, T at5.

We might get information about G, S, T.

So I think ""angst"" is a good guess.

What about ""basin"": B A S I N -> A at2, N at5? But we must check: positions: 1:B,2:A,3:S,4:I,5:N -> so A at2 (allowed), N at5 (allowed). Also, letters: B, A, S, I, N. Avoids C,R,E.

We could consider ""latin"": L A T I N -> A at2, N at5 -> same as above? But letters L,A,T,I,N.

I think ""angst"" might be better because it starts with A and N which we know are present, and then G,S,T are common.

Alternatively, ""saint"" we ruled out because N at4 is forbidden.

Another word: ""daunt"": D A U N T -> A at2, N at4 -> N at4 is forbidden -> no.

""haunt"": same issue.

So I decide to go with ""angst"".

But wait, we have two yellow letters: A and N. So we must include them. Also, avoiding placing A at position3 and N at position4.

In ""angst"": A is at1, which is allowed because only forbidden for A is position3? Actually, the feedback was that A is not at position3 in the word — it could be elsewhere. Similarly, N is at2, not at4.

So it should be valid.

Therefore, I guess ""angst"".

<guess>angst</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

For the next guess, I need a word that:
- Is 5 letters long and a valid English word.
- Includes A and N (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoids C, R, and E (since they are absent).
- Places A in a position other than 3 (so positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Places N in a position other than 4 (so positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).

Additionally, I want to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, G) to maximize information. After considering words like ""sandy"", ""manly"", and ""angst"", I chose ""angst"" because:
- It places A at position 1 and N at position 2 (both allowed positions).
- The letters A and N (which we know are present) are moved to new positions.
- It uses distinct common letters (G, S, T) to probe for additional information.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, E).

This guess will help determine the correct positions for A and N while testing new letters.",Guess 2: angst -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for our first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
This means:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- N is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E is not in the secret word.

So, the secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they were guessed.
In ""crane"", A was the 3rd letter (position 3) and N was the 4th letter (position 4). Therefore, A must be in position 1, 2, or 5? Actually, positions are 1-indexed? 
But note: the word is 5 letters. Positions: 1:c, 2:r, 3:a, 4:n, 5:e.

So, A is in the word but not at position 3. Similarly, N is not at position 4.

Also, C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word does NOT contain: C, R, E.
It DOES contain A and N, but A is not at position 3, and N is not at position 4.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Is a 5-letter English word.
- Does not contain C, R, E (since they are absent).
- Must contain A and N (because we know they are present).
- But A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4.

Also, we have two known correct letters? No, we don't have any in the correct position yet.

We have two letters that are present but in the wrong position: A and N.

So, our new guess should include A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

Moreover, we might want to try other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that have A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible letters: we can use other common consonants and vowels.

Vowels: we have A already, and we don't have O, I, U yet? But E is out.

Consonants: we can use B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (avoiding C, R, E).

We also know that A must be placed in position 1,2,4, or 5? But not 3. Similarly, N must be placed in position 1,2,3, or 5? Not 4.

Let me list possible positions for A: since it's not in position 3, it can be in 1,2,4,5.
Similarly, N: not in position 4, so it can be in 1,2,3,5.

Now, I need a word that has both A and N.

Let me try to think of common words.

Option: ""plant"" - but L and T might be good, and check if it contains forbidden letters: no C,R,E. Also, positions: 
P L A N T -> A is at position 3? But we cannot put A in position 3 because feedback said A is not in position 3. Therefore, ""plant"" would have A in position 3 -> invalid for A? Actually, A must be moved.

So, we need a word where A is not at position 3 and N is not at position 4.

Another word: ""stand"" - S T A N D -> A at position 3: which is not allowed because A cannot be in position 3.

Another: ""thank"" - T H A N K -> A is position 3 -> again not allowed.

We must avoid position 3 for A.

So, words where A is at position 1,2,4,5.

Similarly, N must not be at position 4.

What words have A and N?

Try A at position 1: ""angel"" -> A N G E L -> but E is forbidden (we know E is not in the word). So no.

A at position 1: ""ankle"" -> E is forbidden.

A at position 1: ""anvil"" -> A N V I L -> has N at position 2? Also, it avoids C,R,E. Let's check: A(1), N(2), V(3), I(4), L(5). 
In this case, A is at position 1 (allowed), N is at position 2 (allowed, since N can be at 2). 
But what about the feedback? We don't know if these are correct yet.

We also want to test other letters.

Maybe ""adorn""? But R is forbidden -> no.

Another possibility: A at position 2: for example, ""saint"" -> S A I N T -> A at position 2 (allowed), N at position 4? But we cannot have N at position 4 because feedback said N is not at position 4? Actually, the feedback was for the first guess: in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and it was wrong. So N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, in ""saint"", N is at position 4 -> this would be invalid because we know N is not at position 4.

We must avoid putting N at position 4 in our next guess.

In ""saint"", N is at position 4 -> avoid.

Similarly, we must avoid A at position 3.

So, let's try A at position 2 and N at position 5? For example: ""train"" -> T R A I N -> but R is forbidden -> no.

A at position 2: ""plain"" -> P L A I N -> A at position 3? No, plain: P(1), L(2), A(3) -> A at position 3 -> not allowed.

A at position 4: for example, ""urban"" -> U R B A N -> R is forbidden -> no.

A at position 5: ""woman"" -> W O M A N -> A at position 4? Let's index: 1:W, 2:O, 3:M, 4:A, 5:N -> so A is at 4 (allowed? A can be at 4) and N at 5 (allowed? N can be at 5). Also, no C,R,E.

So ""woman"" is a candidate: letters W, O, M, A, N.

But we are not sure. We could also try ""human"": H U M A N -> 1:H, 2:U, 3:M, 4:A, 5:N -> same positions for A and N.

But maybe we can choose a word that includes more common letters? We haven't tried S, T, L, etc.

Another candidate: A at position 5 and N at position 1? ""nasty"" -> N A S T Y -> N at position 1 (allowed), A at position 2 (allowed). But note: in ""nasty"", A is at position 2 and N at position 1? Let me write: 
Position 1: N, 2: A, 3: S, 4: T, 5: Y.
This avoids position 3 for A? A is at 2 -> allowed. N is at 1 -> allowed. And no C,R,E.

But note: we know A is present and N is present, and we are putting them in new positions.

""nasty"" might be good because it also includes S and T, common letters.

What about ""piano""? P I A N O -> A at position 3 -> not allowed.

Or ""lanes"" -> L A N E S -> E is forbidden -> no.

Let's think of words with A and N that don't put A at pos3 or N at pos4, and avoid C,R,E.

Some words:
- ""sandy"": S A N D Y -> A at pos2, N at pos3 -> allowed? A not at3? A is at2 -> allowed. N not at4? N is at3 -> allowed. Letters: S, A, N, D, Y. No C,R,E.
- ""manly"": M A N L Y -> A at2, N at3 -> allowed.
- ""panel"": P A N E L -> E forbidden -> no.

Another: ""fauna"" -> F A U N A -> A at position 2 and 5? But we have duplicate letters? We don't know if the secret word has duplicates. Also, A at2 is allowed? And N at position 4? But we cannot put N at position 4, so ""fauna"" has N at position 4 -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""banal"": B A N A L -> A at2 and4? N at3? Okay: positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L -> A at2 allowed? And A at4 allowed? But N at3: that is allowed? Since N can be at3. However, we are using two A's? Might not be efficient.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicates, but it's possible.

To maximize information, perhaps we should use distinct letters? Since we don't know.

But in our first guess ""crane"", we had distinct letters.

For second guess, we can try distinct.

So let's go with ""sandy"": 
- S at1, A at2, N at3, D at4, Y at5.

This uses A and N, avoids forbidden letters, and A is not at3? It's at2 -> okay. N at3 -> okay (not the forbidden position which was 4).

Similarly, ""sally"" is not 5 letters? ""Sandy"" is 5.

But we also have ""handy"": H A N D Y -> same positions: A2, N3. Does it include H and D? Which we haven't tested.

But we don't know that H and D are in the word? We are trying to test.

Perhaps we should try to put A in a position we haven't tested? Specifically, in the first guess we had A at3 and N at4. Now we need to move them.

We know A is not at3, so we try A at another position: say position 1? But earlier we had trouble.

What about ""again""? A G G A I -> double G? And we don't know about G and I. Also, A at1 and4? But N? We need to have N.

We must include N.

So words with A and N: are there words with A at position 5?

""wagon"": W A G O N -> has O, but note: W(1), A(2), G(3), O(4), N(5). A at2, N at5 -> allowed? Avoid forbidden: C,R,E? It has W,A,G,O,N -> no forbidden letters.

But A at position2 -> same as in ""sandy""? Or we can vary.

To get different positions, we could try A at position1: 
""ankhs""? Not common. ""angst"": A N G S T -> A(1), N(2), G(3), S(4), T(5). So A at1, N at2 -> allowed? And avoids C,R,E.

Also, letters: A, N, G, S, T -> all common.

So ""angst"": positions: 
1: A (not in position that was forbidden? But forbidden for A was only position3? So A at1 is fine)
2: N (not forbidden position4? So at2 is fine)
Then G, S, T: which are new.

Similarly, we can get information about S, T, etc.

Alternatively, ""adult"": A D U L T -> but no N.

We must include N.

So between ""sandy"" and ""angst"", I think ""angst"" might be better because it places A at a new position (1) and N at2 (instead of3). Also, it uses more common letters: S, T, G.

Let me compare:
- ""sandy"": S, A, N, D, Y -> letters: S, A, N, D, Y. We already know A and N are in the word, so we are testing S, D, Y.
- ""angst"": A, N, G, S, T -> testing G, S, T.

Since we have only green for A and N? Actually, they are yellow, meaning they are in wrong positions.

We are to choose a word that has A and N in positions that are not 3 and 4 respectively? That's minimal, but we also want to cover other common letters.

Another word: ""paint"". P A I N T -> A at2, N at4? But we cannot have N at4 -> avoid.

""taint"": T A I N T -> A at2, N at4 -> not allowed.

""lying"": L Y I N G -> no A.

I think ""angst"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: 
Guess: ""angst""
- If A is in the word but not at position1? We know A is in the word, so if we get A(✓), that would be great. Otherwise, if we get A(-), then we know it's not at1. Similarly for N at position2.

But by putting A at1 and N at2, we are testing positions that we haven't tried before? Actually, in the first guess, we didn't have A at1 or N at2? We had A at3 and N at4.

So we are moving them.

Moreover, G at3, S at4, T at5.

We might get information about G, S, T.

So I think ""angst"" is a good guess.

What about ""basin"": B A S I N -> A at2, N at5? But we must check: positions: 1:B,2:A,3:S,4:I,5:N -> so A at2 (allowed), N at5 (allowed). Also, letters: B, A, S, I, N. Avoids C,R,E.

We could consider ""latin"": L A T I N -> A at2, N at5 -> same as above? But letters L,A,T,I,N.

I think ""angst"" might be better because it starts with A and N which we know are present, and then G,S,T are common.

Alternatively, ""saint"" we ruled out because N at4 is forbidden.

Another word: ""daunt"": D A U N T -> A at2, N at4 -> N at4 is forbidden -> no.

""haunt"": same issue.

So I decide to go with ""angst"".

But wait, we have two yellow letters: A and N. So we must include them. Also, avoiding placing A at position3 and N at position4.

In ""angst"": A is at1, which is allowed because only forbidden for A is position3? Actually, the feedback was that A is not at position3 in the word — it could be elsewhere. Similarly, N is at2, not at4.

So it should be valid.

Therefore, I guess ""angst"".

<guess>angst</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

For the next guess, I need a word that:
- Is 5 letters long and a valid English word.
- Includes A and N (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoids C, R, and E (since they are absent).
- Places A in a position other than 3 (so positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Places N in a position other than 4 (so positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).

Additionally, I want to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, G) to maximize information. After considering words like ""sandy"", ""manly"", and ""angst"", I chose ""angst"" because:
- It places A at position 1 and N at position 2 (both allowed positions).
- The letters A and N (which we know are present) are moved to new positions.
- It uses distinct common letters (G, S, T) to probe for additional information.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, E).

This guess will help determine the correct positions for A and N while testing new letters.

So no.\n\nA at position 1: ""ankle"" -> E is forbidden.\n\nA at position 1: ""anvil"" -> A N V I L -> has N at position 2? Also, it avoids C,R,E. Let\'s check: A(1), N(2), V(3), I(4), L(5). \nIn this case, A is at position 1 (allowed), N is at position 2 (allowed, since N can be at 2). \nBut what about the feedback? We don\'t know if these are correct yet.\n\nWe also want to test other letters.\n\nMaybe ""adorn""? But R is forbidden -> no.\n\nAnother possibility: A at position 2: for example, ""saint"" -> S A I N T -> A at position 2 (allowed), N at position 4? But we cannot have N at position 4 because feedback said N is not at position 4? Actually, the feedback was for the first guess: in ""crane"", N was at position 4 and it was wrong. So N is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, in ""saint"", N is at position 4 -> this would be invalid because we know N is not at position 4.\n\nWe must avoid putting N at position 4 in our next guess.\n\nIn ""saint"", N is at position 4 -> avoid.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid A at position 3.\n\nSo, let\'s try A at position 2 and N at position 5? For example: ""train"" -> T R A I N -> but R is forbidden -> no.\n\nA at position 2: ""plain"" -> P L A I N -> A at position 3? No, plain: P(1), L(2), A(3) -> A at position 3 -> not allowed.\n\nA at position 4: for example, ""urban"" -> U R B A N -> R is forbidden -> no.\n\nA at position 5: ""woman"" -> W O M A N -> A at position 4? Let\'s index: 1:W, 2:O, 3:M, 4:A, 5:N -> so A is at 4 (allowed? A can be at 4) and N at 5 (allowed? N can be at 5). Also, no C,R,E.\n\nSo ""woman"" is a candidate: letters W, O, M, A, N.\n\nBut we are not sure. We could also try ""human"": H U M A N -> 1:H, 2:U, 3:M, 4:A, 5:N -> same positions for A and N.\n\nBut maybe we can choose a word that includes more common letters? We haven\'t tried S, T, L, etc.\n\nAnother candidate: A at position 5 and N at position 1? ""nasty"" -> N A S T Y -> N at position 1 (allowed), A at position 2 (allowed). But note: in ""nasty"", A is at position 2 and N at position 1? Let me write: \nPosition 1: N, 2: A, 3: S, 4: T, 5: Y.\nThis avoids position 3 for A? A is at 2 -> allowed. N is at 1 -> allowed. And no C,R,E.\n\nBut note: we know A is present and N is present, and we are putting them in new positions.\n\n""nasty"" might be good because it also includes S and T, common letters.\n\nWhat about ""piano""? P I A N O -> A at position 3 -> not allowed.\n\nOr ""lanes"" -> L A N E S -> E is forbidden -> no.\n\nLet\'s think of words with A and N that don\'t put A at pos3 or N at pos4, and avoid C,R,E.\n\nSome words:\n- ""sandy"": S A N D Y -> A at pos2, N at pos3 -> allowed? A not at3? A is at2 -> allowed. N not at4? N is at3 -> allowed. Letters: S, A, N, D, Y. No C,R,E.\n- ""manly"": M A N L Y -> A at2, N at3 -> allowed.\n- ""panel"": P A N E L -> E forbidden -> no.\n\nAnother: ""fauna"" -> F A U N A -> A at position 2 and 5? But we have duplicate letters? We don\'t know if the secret word has duplicates. Also, A at2 is allowed? And N at position 4? But we cannot put N at position 4, so ""fauna"" has N at position 4 -> not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""banal"": B A N A L -> A at2 and4? N at3? Okay: positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:A, 5:L -> A at2 allowed? And A at4 allowed? But N at3: that is allowed? Since N can be at3. However, we are using two A\'s? Might not be efficient.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has duplicates, but it\'s possible.\n\nTo maximize information, perhaps we should use distinct letters? Since we don\'t know.\n\nBut in our first guess ""crane"", we had distinct letters.\n\nFor second guess, we can try distinct.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""sandy"": \n- S at1, A at2, N at3, D at4, Y at5.\n\nThis uses A and N, avoids forbidden letters, and A is not at3? It\'s at2 -> okay. N at3 -> okay (not the forbidden position which was 4).\n\nSimilarly, ""sally"" is not 5 letters? ""Sandy"" is 5.\n\nBut we also have ""handy"": H A N D Y -> same positions: A2, N3. Does it include H and D? Which we haven\'t tested.\n\nBut we don\'t know that H and D are in the word? We are trying to test.\n\nPerhaps we should try to put A in a position we haven\'t tested? Specifically, in the first guess we had A at3 and N at4. Now we need to move them.\n\nWe know A is not at3, so we try A at another position: say position 1? But earlier we had trouble.\n\nWhat about ""again""? A G G A I -> double G? And we don\'t know about G and I. Also, A at1 and4? But N? We need to have N.\n\nWe must include N.\n\nSo words with A and N: are there words with A at position 5?\n\n""wagon"": W A G O N -> has O, but note: W(1), A(2), G(3), O(4), N(5). A at2, N at5 -> allowed? Avoid forbidden: C,R,E? It has W,A,G,O,N -> no forbidden letters.\n\nBut A at position2 -> same as in ""sandy""? Or we can vary.\n\nTo get different positions, we could try A at position1: \n""ankhs""? Not common. ""angst"": A N G S T -> A(1), N(2), G(3), S(4), T(5). So A at1, N at2 -> allowed? And avoids C,R,E.\n\nAlso, letters: A, N, G, S, T -> all common.\n\nSo ""angst"": positions: \n1: A (not in position that was forbidden? But forbidden for A was only position3? So A at1 is fine)\n2: N (not forbidden position4? So at2 is fine)\nThen G, S, T: which are new.\n\nSimilarly, we can get information about S, T, etc.\n\nAlternatively, ""adult"": A D U L T -> but no N.\n\nWe must include N.\n\nSo between ""sandy"" and ""angst"", I think ""angst"" might be better because it places A at a new position (1) and N at2 (instead of3). Also, it uses more common letters: S, T, G.\n\nLet me compare:\n- ""sandy"": S, A, N, D, Y -> letters: S, A, N, D, Y. We already know A and N are in the word, so we are testing S, D, Y.\n- ""angst"": A, N, G, S, T -> testing G, S, T.\n\nSince we have only green for A and N? Actually, they are yellow, meaning they are in wrong positions.\n\nWe are to choose a word that has A and N in positions that are not 3 and 4 respectively? That\'s minimal, but we also want to cover other common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""paint"". P A I N T -> A at2, N at4? But we cannot have N at4 -> avoid.\n\n""taint"": T A I N T -> A at2, N at4 -> not allowed.\n\n""lying"": L Y I N G -> no A.\n\nI think ""angst"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: \nGuess: ""angst""\n- If A is in the word but not at position1? We know A is in the word, so if we get A(✓), that would be great. Otherwise, if we get A(-), then we know it\'s not at1. Similarly for N at position2.\n\nBut by putting A at1 and N at2, we are testing positions that we haven\'t tried before? Actually, in the first guess, we didn\'t have A at1 or N at2? We had A at3 and N at4.\n\nSo we are moving them.\n\nMoreover, G at3, S at4, T at5.\n\nWe might get information about G, S, T.\n\nSo I think ""angst"" is a good guess.\n\nWhat about ""basin"": B A S I N -> A at2, N at5? But we must check: positions: 1:B,2:A,3:S,4:I,5:N -> so A at2 (allowed), N at5 (allowed). Also, letters: B, A, S, I, N. Avoids C,R,E.\n\nWe could consider ""latin"": L A T I N -> A at2, N at5 -> same as above? But letters L,A,T,I,N.\n\nI think ""angst"" might be better because it starts with A and N which we know are present, and then G,S,T are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""saint"" we ruled out because N at4 is forbidden.\n\nAnother word: ""daunt"": D A U N T -> A at2, N at4 -> N at4 is forbidden -> no.\n\n""haunt"": same issue.\n\nSo I decide to go with ""angst"".\n\nBut wait, we have two yellow letters: A and N. So we must include them. Also, avoiding placing A at position3 and N at position4.\n\nIn ""angst"": A is at1, which is allowed because only forbidden for A is position3? Actually, the feedback was that A is not at position3 in the word — it could be elsewhere. Similarly, N is at2, not at4.\n\nSo it should be valid.\n\nTherefore, I guess ""angst"".\n\n<guess>angst</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": \n- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word.\n- A is in the word but not in position 3.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n\nFor the next guess, I need a word that:\n- Is 5 letters long and a valid English word.\n- Includes A and N (since they are confirmed present).\n- Avoids C, R, and E (since they are absent).\n- Places A in a position other than 3 (so positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n- Places N in a position other than 4 (so positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).\n\nAdditionally, I want to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, G) to maximize information. After considering words like ""sandy"", ""manly"", and ""angst"", I chose ""angst"" because:\n- It places A at position 1 and N at position 2 (both allowed positions).\n- The letters A and N (which we know are present) are moved to new positions.\n- It uses distinct common letters (G, S, T) to probe for additional information.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, E).\n\nThis guess will help determine the correct positions for A and N while testing new letters.\n\n<guess>angst</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: angst -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (where it was in ""crane"").
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (where it was in ""crane"").

Guess 2: ""angst"" -> Feedback: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (where it was in ""angst"").
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (where it was in ""angst"").
- G, S, T are not in the word.

So, combining the information:

Absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T. (So we must avoid these.)

Present letters: A and N (from both guesses, they are confirmed present).

We also know the positions where A and N cannot be:

For A:
- Not in position 3 (from ""crane"")
- Not in position 1 (from ""angst"")

So A cannot be in position 1 or 3. Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

For N:
- Not in position 4 (from ""crane"")
- Not in position 2 (from ""angst"")

So N cannot be in position 2 or 4. Therefore, N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Now, the secret word has exactly 5 letters and contains A and N, and no C, R, E, G, S, T.

We need to make a new guess that includes A and N, and uses only the remaining possible letters.

What letters are left? We have the entire alphabet minus the absent ones.

Absent: C, R, E, G, S, T.

So available letters: A, B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: A and N must be in the word, so we have to include them.

Also, we have constraints on their positions.

We should try to use common letters to maximize information. Common letters left: B, D, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We also need to consider the positions for A and N.

Possible positions:
- A: 2, 4, 5
- N: 1, 3, 5

But note: if both A and N are at position 5, that would be impossible because one position can't have two letters. So we must assign them to different positions.

Therefore, the possible pairs of positions for (A, N) are:

- A at 2, N at 1
- A at 2, N at 3
- A at 2, N at 5
- A at 4, N at 1
- A at 4, N at 3
- A at 4, N at 5
- A at 5, N at 1
- A at 5, N at 3

But note: if A is at 5, N cannot be at 5, so N must be at 1 or 3. Similarly, if N is at 5, A must be at 2 or 4.

We need to choose a word that fits one of these and uses the available letters.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words that have A and N, with the position constraints.

For example, let's try A at position 2 and N at position 1: that would be N A _ _ _

Words: ""na? ? ?"" - e.g., ""naval"", but V and L are available? But ""naval"" has two A's? Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but it's possible.

But let's list:

- ""naval"": N A V A L -> A at position 2 and 4? But we are considering A at position 2, and N at 1. But ""naval"" has A at 2 and 4. However, we are only required to have A present, and we are putting it at 2. But the word has two A's? That might be okay, but we don't know. Also, we have to avoid S,T, etc.

""naval"" has N at1, A at2, V at3, A at4, L at5. So A is at2 and4. But we are only testing A at2? Actually, we are including A, and it will show if A is at2 or not. But the word might have two A's.

But we are limited by the available letters.

Another word: ""nappy"" -> N A P P Y -> but P and Y are available? Yes. And A at2.

But we don't know about P and Y.

Similarly, ""nadir"": N A D I R -> but R is absent! We know R is not in the word, so ""nadir"" has R -> invalid.

""naive"": N A I V E -> E is absent -> invalid.

""naked"": N A K E D -> E absent -> invalid.

So A at2 and N at1: hard to find without E or R.

What about A at2 and N at3: so _ A N _ _

Words: ""banjo"" -> B A N J O -> letters: B, A, N, J, O. All available? B, A, N, J, O are not in the absent list. So possible.

""manor"": M A N O R -> R absent -> invalid.

""canal"": C absent -> invalid.

""panel"": E absent -> invalid.

""banal"": B A N A L -> A at2 and4? But we are putting A at2 and N at3. Also, B, A, N, A, L. Available letters? B, A, N, L are available. So ""banal"" is a candidate.

But it has two A's? That might be okay.

Another: ""handy"": H A N D Y -> but in ""handy"", A is at2, N at3. And H, D, Y available. But we already used H? No, we haven't used H, it's available.

But wait, in our second guess, we have G,S,T absent, but H is not absent, so it could be present.

But we don't know if H is in the word. Similarly for D and Y.

But ""handy"" is a valid word.

However, we have to consider the position constraints: A at2 and N at3 is allowed.

Similarly, A at2 and N at5: _ A _ _ N

Words: ""dawn"", but that's 4 letters. ""fauna"": F A U N A -> A at2 and5, N at4? But N at4 is forbidden! We cannot have N at position 4. In ""fauna"", N is at position 4? Let's see: F(1), A(2), U(3), N(4), A(5). So N at4 -> not allowed.

""pagan"": P A G A N -> G is absent -> invalid.

""rayon"": R absent -> invalid.

""cabin"": C absent -> invalid.

So A at2 and N at5 might be hard.

Now, A at4 and N at1: N _ _ A _

Words: ""nodal"": N O D A L -> O, D, L available? Yes. N at1, A at4.

""notal""? Not a word. ""noval""? Not common. ""noble"": N O B L E -> E absent -> invalid.

""nasal"": N A S A L -> but S is absent -> invalid.

""naval"" we considered earlier, but that has A at2 and4, not N at1 and A at4.

For N at1 and A at4: ""n? ? A ?"", e.g., ""nubia"" not common. ""nomad"": N O M A D -> N at1, A at4. Letters: N, O, M, A, D. All available.

So ""nomad"" is a candidate.

Similarly, A at4 and N at3: _ _ N A _

Words: ""bwana""? Not common. ""donor"": D O N O R -> R absent -> invalid.

""tonal"": T absent -> invalid.

""final"": F I N A L -> F, I, L available? Yes. ""final"" has N at3, A at4.

Similarly, ""vinal""? Not common. ""final"" is good.

A at4 and N at5: _ _ _ A N

Words: ""urban"": U R B A N -> R absent -> invalid.

""organ"": G absent -> invalid.

""titan"": T absent -> invalid.

""woman"": W O M A N -> W, O, M available? Yes. And A at4, N at5.

""human"": H U M A N -> same.

""daman""? Not common.

So ""woman"" or ""human"".

A at5 and N at1: N _ _ _ A

Words: ""nubia"" not common. ""novae"": E absent. ""noria"": O, R? R absent. ""nappy"" we had, but A at2, not at5.

""nappy"" has A at2. For N at1 and A at5: ""n? ? ? A"", e.g., ""neigh"": E absent. ""nymph"": N Y M P H -> Y, M, P, H available. A? No A. We need A at5.

""nada"": N A D A -> not 5 letters. ""naira"": N A I R A -> R absent.

Hard to find.

A at5 and N at3: _ _ N _ A

Words: ""bwana"" not common. ""china"": C absent. ""donna"": D O N N A -> double N? And A at5. But N at3 and4? We have N at3, and another N at4? But we know N is present, but it might be duplicated.

""donna"": D O N N A -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A. So N at3 and4, A at5.

But we are putting N at3, which is allowed, and A at5, allowed.

But we don't know if the word has two N's.

Similarly, ""penna"": E absent.

""inane"": I N A N E -> E absent.

""junta"": J U N T A -> T absent -> invalid.

So not many options.

Now, from above, we have some candidate words:

1. ""banal"": B A N A L -> A at2 and4, N at3. But we are testing A at2 and N at3? Actually, in ""banal"", A is at position 2 and 4, and N at 3. So we have A at2 (which is a possible position) and N at3 (possible). Also, we are introducing B and L.

But note: we have two A's, so if the secret word has only one A, we might get confusing feedback? But we'll see.

2. ""handy"": H A N D Y -> A at2, N at3, and H, D, Y.

3. ""nomad"": N O M A D -> N at1, A at4, O, M, D.

4. ""final"": F I N A L -> N at3, A at4, F, I, L.

5. ""woman"": W O M A N -> A at4, N at5, W, O, M.

6. ""human"": H U M A N -> A at4, N at5, H, U, M.

We need to choose one that maximizes new information.

We know A and N are present, so we are mainly testing the positions and the other letters.

We should avoid using letters that might be absent if possible, but we don't know.

Since we have limited guesses, we should try to cover more common letters.

Common letters left: B, D, H, L, M, O, P, U, Y, etc.

In ""banal"": letters B, A, N, A, L -> we test B and L.

In ""handy"": H, A, N, D, Y -> test H, D, Y.

In ""nomad"": N, O, M, A, D -> test O, M, D.

In ""final"": F, I, N, A, L -> test F, I, L.

In ""woman"": W, O, M, A, N -> test W, O, M.

In ""human"": H, U, M, A, N -> test H, U, M.

We also have to consider the position constraints: for example, in ""banal"", A is at position 2 and 4. But we know A must be in 2,4, or5, so both are possible. Similarly, N at3 is possible.

But if we guess ""banal"", and if the secret word has only one A, we might get feedback that one A is correct or not? The feedback will mark each letter.

But it might be messy.

Similarly, ""handy"" has A at2 and N at3, which are both possible.

But let's see what positions we are testing for A: in ""banal"", we have A at2 and4. In ""handy"", A at2 only.

We need to test positions that are still possible for A: 2,4,5.

Similarly for N: 1,3,5.

In ""handy"", we are testing A at2 and N at3.

In ""woman"", we are testing A at4 and N at5.

We might want to test a position for A that we haven't tested much. We tested A at3 (in crane) and at1 (in angst), both wrong. So we haven't tested position 2,4,5 at all.

Similarly for N: tested at4 (crane) and at2 (angst), both wrong, so not tested 1,3,5.

So testing A at2 and N at3 (as in ""handy"") or A at4 and N at5 (as in ""woman"") are both good.

I think ""handy"" is a good choice because it uses common letters H, D, Y.

But let's see if we can find a word that tests position 5 for A or position 1 for N.

For example, A at5: we have ""woman"" but that has A at4, not at5.

""woman"" has A at4, N at5.

What about a word with A at5? For example, ""pizza"" but Z and A, but no N.

We need N.

""arena"": E and A? E absent.

""drama"": D R A M A -> R absent.

""llama"": L L A M A -> no N.

Hard to find a word with A at5 and N present.

Similarly, N at1: we have ""nomad"" with N at1 and A at4.

I think ""handy"" is a solid choice.

But let's check the word list.

Another candidate: ""bandy"": B A N D Y -> A at2, N at3, B, D, Y. Similar to ""handy"" but with B instead of H.

""bandy"" is a word meaning to pass things around.

But H might be more common? Not sure.

We could choose ""handy"" or ""bandy"".

I'll go with ""handy"" because it's a common word.

So guess: ""handy""

But let's confirm the positions: H(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5)

A is at position 2 (allowed), N at position 3 (allowed).

And letters: H, A, N, D, Y — all not in the absent list.

So it should be valid.

Therefore, I guess ""handy"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  
  This means:
  - C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word.
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - N is in the word but not in position 4.

- **Guess 2: ""angst""** → Feedback: A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)  
  This means:
  - A is in the word but not in position 1.
  - N is in the word but not in position 2.
  - G, S, and T are **not** in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **Absent letters (must avoid):** C, R, E, G, S, T.
- **Present letters (must include):** A and N (confirmed from both guesses).
- **Position constraints for A:** Cannot be in position 1 (from ""angst"") or 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- **Position constraints for N:** Cannot be in position 2 (from ""angst"") or 4 (from ""crane""). So N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- **Available letters:** A, B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters).
- **Goal for the next guess:** Include A and N in allowed positions, avoid absent letters, and test new common letters (e.g., H, D, Y, L, M) to gather more information.

### Thought Process for the Next Guess:
- We need a word with A and N, where:
  - A is in position 2, 4, or 5.
  - N is in position 1, 3, or 5.
  - A and N cannot share position 5 (since one position can't hold two letters).
- Possible position combinations for (A, N): (2,1), (2,3), (2,5), (4,1), (4,3), (4,5), (5,1), (5,3).
- To maximize information, prioritize:
  - Testing new common letters (e.g., H, D, L, M, O, Y).
  - Covering untested positions for A (positions 2, 4, 5) and N (positions 1, 3, 5).
- Candidate words considered:
  - **""handy""**: A at position 2, N at position 3. Tests H, D, Y (new letters). Fits constraints.
  - **""banal""**: A at positions 2 and 4, N at position 3. Tests B and L. Less ideal due to duplicate A, which might complicate feedback.
  - **""nomad""**: N at position 1, A at position 4. Tests O, M, D. Valid but tests fewer common letters.
  - **""woman""**: A at position 4, N at position 5. Tests W, O, M. Valid but positions 4 and 5 for A/N are less commonly tested together.
- **Why ""handy"" is chosen**:
  - It places A in position 2 (untested) and N in position 3 (untested), which helps narrow down their correct positions.
  - It introduces three new common letters (H, D, Y) that haven't been tested yet.
  - It avoids all absent letters and fits the constraints perfectly.
  - ""Handy"" is a common English word, reducing the risk of invalidity.

<guess>handy</guess>",handy,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Meaning:
- C, R, E are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (where it was in ""crane"").
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (where it was in ""crane"").

Guess 2: ""angst"" -> Feedback: A(-) N(-) G(x) S(x) T(x)
Meaning:
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (where it was in ""angst"").
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (where it was in ""angst"").
- G, S, T are not in the word.

So, combining the information:

Absent letters: C, R, E, G, S, T. (So we must avoid these.)

Present letters: A and N (from both guesses, they are confirmed present).

We also know the positions where A and N cannot be:

For A:
- Not in position 3 (from ""crane"")
- Not in position 1 (from ""angst"")

So A cannot be in position 1 or 3. Therefore, A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

For N:
- Not in position 4 (from ""crane"")
- Not in position 2 (from ""angst"")

So N cannot be in position 2 or 4. Therefore, N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Now, the secret word has exactly 5 letters and contains A and N, and no C, R, E, G, S, T.

We need to make a new guess that includes A and N, and uses only the remaining possible letters.

What letters are left? We have the entire alphabet minus the absent ones.

Absent: C, R, E, G, S, T.

So available letters: A, B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: A and N must be in the word, so we have to include them.

Also, we have constraints on their positions.

We should try to use common letters to maximize information. Common letters left: B, D, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We also need to consider the positions for A and N.

Possible positions:
- A: 2, 4, 5
- N: 1, 3, 5

But note: if both A and N are at position 5, that would be impossible because one position can't have two letters. So we must assign them to different positions.

Therefore, the possible pairs of positions for (A, N) are:

- A at 2, N at 1
- A at 2, N at 3
- A at 2, N at 5
- A at 4, N at 1
- A at 4, N at 3
- A at 4, N at 5
- A at 5, N at 1
- A at 5, N at 3

But note: if A is at 5, N cannot be at 5, so N must be at 1 or 3. Similarly, if N is at 5, A must be at 2 or 4.

We need to choose a word that fits one of these and uses the available letters.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words that have A and N, with the position constraints.

For example, let's try A at position 2 and N at position 1: that would be N A _ _ _

Words: ""na? ? ?"" - e.g., ""naval"", but V and L are available? But ""naval"" has two A's? Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but it's possible.

But let's list:

- ""naval"": N A V A L -> A at position 2 and 4? But we are considering A at position 2, and N at 1. But ""naval"" has A at 2 and 4. However, we are only required to have A present, and we are putting it at 2. But the word has two A's? That might be okay, but we don't know. Also, we have to avoid S,T, etc.

""naval"" has N at1, A at2, V at3, A at4, L at5. So A is at2 and4. But we are only testing A at2? Actually, we are including A, and it will show if A is at2 or not. But the word might have two A's.

But we are limited by the available letters.

Another word: ""nappy"" -> N A P P Y -> but P and Y are available? Yes. And A at2.

But we don't know about P and Y.

Similarly, ""nadir"": N A D I R -> but R is absent! We know R is not in the word, so ""nadir"" has R -> invalid.

""naive"": N A I V E -> E is absent -> invalid.

""naked"": N A K E D -> E absent -> invalid.

So A at2 and N at1: hard to find without E or R.

What about A at2 and N at3: so _ A N _ _

Words: ""banjo"" -> B A N J O -> letters: B, A, N, J, O. All available? B, A, N, J, O are not in the absent list. So possible.

""manor"": M A N O R -> R absent -> invalid.

""canal"": C absent -> invalid.

""panel"": E absent -> invalid.

""banal"": B A N A L -> A at2 and4? But we are putting A at2 and N at3. Also, B, A, N, A, L. Available letters? B, A, N, L are available. So ""banal"" is a candidate.

But it has two A's? That might be okay.

Another: ""handy"": H A N D Y -> but in ""handy"", A is at2, N at3. And H, D, Y available. But we already used H? No, we haven't used H, it's available.

But wait, in our second guess, we have G,S,T absent, but H is not absent, so it could be present.

But we don't know if H is in the word. Similarly for D and Y.

But ""handy"" is a valid word.

However, we have to consider the position constraints: A at2 and N at3 is allowed.

Similarly, A at2 and N at5: _ A _ _ N

Words: ""dawn"", but that's 4 letters. ""fauna"": F A U N A -> A at2 and5, N at4? But N at4 is forbidden! We cannot have N at position 4. In ""fauna"", N is at position 4? Let's see: F(1), A(2), U(3), N(4), A(5). So N at4 -> not allowed.

""pagan"": P A G A N -> G is absent -> invalid.

""rayon"": R absent -> invalid.

""cabin"": C absent -> invalid.

So A at2 and N at5 might be hard.

Now, A at4 and N at1: N _ _ A _

Words: ""nodal"": N O D A L -> O, D, L available? Yes. N at1, A at4.

""notal""? Not a word. ""noval""? Not common. ""noble"": N O B L E -> E absent -> invalid.

""nasal"": N A S A L -> but S is absent -> invalid.

""naval"" we considered earlier, but that has A at2 and4, not N at1 and A at4.

For N at1 and A at4: ""n? ? A ?"", e.g., ""nubia"" not common. ""nomad"": N O M A D -> N at1, A at4. Letters: N, O, M, A, D. All available.

So ""nomad"" is a candidate.

Similarly, A at4 and N at3: _ _ N A _

Words: ""bwana""? Not common. ""donor"": D O N O R -> R absent -> invalid.

""tonal"": T absent -> invalid.

""final"": F I N A L -> F, I, L available? Yes. ""final"" has N at3, A at4.

Similarly, ""vinal""? Not common. ""final"" is good.

A at4 and N at5: _ _ _ A N

Words: ""urban"": U R B A N -> R absent -> invalid.

""organ"": G absent -> invalid.

""titan"": T absent -> invalid.

""woman"": W O M A N -> W, O, M available? Yes. And A at4, N at5.

""human"": H U M A N -> same.

""daman""? Not common.

So ""woman"" or ""human"".

A at5 and N at1: N _ _ _ A

Words: ""nubia"" not common. ""novae"": E absent. ""noria"": O, R? R absent. ""nappy"" we had, but A at2, not at5.

""nappy"" has A at2. For N at1 and A at5: ""n? ? ? A"", e.g., ""neigh"": E absent. ""nymph"": N Y M P H -> Y, M, P, H available. A? No A. We need A at5.

""nada"": N A D A -> not 5 letters. ""naira"": N A I R A -> R absent.

Hard to find.

A at5 and N at3: _ _ N _ A

Words: ""bwana"" not common. ""china"": C absent. ""donna"": D O N N A -> double N? And A at5. But N at3 and4? We have N at3, and another N at4? But we know N is present, but it might be duplicated.

""donna"": D O N N A -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A. So N at3 and4, A at5.

But we are putting N at3, which is allowed, and A at5, allowed.

But we don't know if the word has two N's.

Similarly, ""penna"": E absent.

""inane"": I N A N E -> E absent.

""junta"": J U N T A -> T absent -> invalid.

So not many options.

Now, from above, we have some candidate words:

1. ""banal"": B A N A L -> A at2 and4, N at3. But we are testing A at2 and N at3? Actually, in ""banal"", A is at position 2 and 4, and N at 3. So we have A at2 (which is a possible position) and N at3 (possible). Also, we are introducing B and L.

But note: we have two A's, so if the secret word has only one A, we might get confusing feedback? But we'll see.

2. ""handy"": H A N D Y -> A at2, N at3, and H, D, Y.

3. ""nomad"": N O M A D -> N at1, A at4, O, M, D.

4. ""final"": F I N A L -> N at3, A at4, F, I, L.

5. ""woman"": W O M A N -> A at4, N at5, W, O, M.

6. ""human"": H U M A N -> A at4, N at5, H, U, M.

We need to choose one that maximizes new information.

We know A and N are present, so we are mainly testing the positions and the other letters.

We should avoid using letters that might be absent if possible, but we don't know.

Since we have limited guesses, we should try to cover more common letters.

Common letters left: B, D, H, L, M, O, P, U, Y, etc.

In ""banal"": letters B, A, N, A, L -> we test B and L.

In ""handy"": H, A, N, D, Y -> test H, D, Y.

In ""nomad"": N, O, M, A, D -> test O, M, D.

In ""final"": F, I, N, A, L -> test F, I, L.

In ""woman"": W, O, M, A, N -> test W, O, M.

In ""human"": H, U, M, A, N -> test H, U, M.

We also have to consider the position constraints: for example, in ""banal"", A is at position 2 and 4. But we know A must be in 2,4, or5, so both are possible. Similarly, N at3 is possible.

But if we guess ""banal"", and if the secret word has only one A, we might get feedback that one A is correct or not? The feedback will mark each letter.

But it might be messy.

Similarly, ""handy"" has A at2 and N at3, which are both possible.

But let's see what positions we are testing for A: in ""banal"", we have A at2 and4. In ""handy"", A at2 only.

We need to test positions that are still possible for A: 2,4,5.

Similarly for N: 1,3,5.

In ""handy"", we are testing A at2 and N at3.

In ""woman"", we are testing A at4 and N at5.

We might want to test a position for A that we haven't tested much. We tested A at3 (in crane) and at1 (in angst), both wrong. So we haven't tested position 2,4,5 at all.

Similarly for N: tested at4 (crane) and at2 (angst), both wrong, so not tested 1,3,5.

So testing A at2 and N at3 (as in ""handy"") or A at4 and N at5 (as in ""woman"") are both good.

I think ""handy"" is a good choice because it uses common letters H, D, Y.

But let's see if we can find a word that tests position 5 for A or position 1 for N.

For example, A at5: we have ""woman"" but that has A at4, not at5.

""woman"" has A at4, N at5.

What about a word with A at5? For example, ""pizza"" but Z and A, but no N.

We need N.

""arena"": E and A? E absent.

""drama"": D R A M A -> R absent.

""llama"": L L A M A -> no N.

Hard to find a word with A at5 and N present.

Similarly, N at1: we have ""nomad"" with N at1 and A at4.

I think ""handy"" is a solid choice.

But let's check the word list.

Another candidate: ""bandy"": B A N D Y -> A at2, N at3, B, D, Y. Similar to ""handy"" but with B instead of H.

""bandy"" is a word meaning to pass things around.

But H might be more common? Not sure.

We could choose ""handy"" or ""bandy"".

I'll go with ""handy"" because it's a common word.

So guess: ""handy""

But let's confirm the positions: H(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5)

A is at position 2 (allowed), N at position 3 (allowed).

And letters: H, A, N, D, Y — all not in the absent list.

So it should be valid.

Therefore, I guess ""handy"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  
  This means:
  - C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word.
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - N is in the word but not in position 4.

- **Guess 2: ""angst""** → Feedback: A(-), N(-), G(x), S(x), T(x)  
  This means:
  - A is in the word but not in position 1.
  - N is in the word but not in position 2.
  - G, S, and T are **not** in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **Absent letters (must avoid):** C, R, E, G, S, T.
- **Present letters (must include):** A and N (confirmed from both guesses).
- **Position constraints for A:** Cannot be in position 1 (from ""angst"") or 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- **Position constraints for N:** Cannot be in position 2 (from ""angst"") or 4 (from ""crane""). So N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- **Available letters:** A, B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters).
- **Goal for the next guess:** Include A and N in allowed positions, avoid absent letters, and test new common letters (e.g., H, D, Y, L, M) to gather more information.

### Thought Process for the Next Guess:
- We need a word with A and N, where:
  - A is in position 2, 4, or 5.
  - N is in position 1, 3, or 5.
  - A and N cannot share position 5 (since one position can't hold two letters).
- Possible position combinations for (A, N): (2,1), (2,3), (2,5), (4,1), (4,3), (4,5), (5,1), (5,3).
- To maximize information, prioritize:
  - Testing new common letters (e.g., H, D, L, M, O, Y).
  - Covering untested positions for A (positions 2, 4, 5) and N (positions 1, 3, 5).
- Candidate words considered:
  - **""handy""**: A at position 2, N at position 3. Tests H, D, Y (new letters). Fits constraints.
  - **""banal""**: A at positions 2 and 4, N at position 3. Tests B and L. Less ideal due to duplicate A, which might complicate feedback.
  - **""nomad""**: N at position 1, A at position 4. Tests O, M, D. Valid but tests fewer common letters.
  - **""woman""**: A at position 4, N at position 5. Tests W, O, M. Valid but positions 4 and 5 for A/N are less commonly tested together.
- **Why ""handy"" is chosen**:
  - It places A in position 2 (untested) and N in position 3 (untested), which helps narrow down their correct positions.
  - It introduces three new common letters (H, D, Y) that haven't been tested yet.
  - It avoids all absent letters and fits the constraints perfectly.
  - ""Handy"" is a common English word, reducing the risk of invalidity.",Guess 3: handy -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) A(✓) N(✓) D(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
