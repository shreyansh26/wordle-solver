We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and positions.
 A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. 
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E).
   - It covers letters that frequently appear in 5-letter words.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Interpretation:
- The letter C is in the secret word and is in the first position (since we got a checkmark).
- The letter R is not in the secret word at all (x).
- The letter A is not in the secret word at all (x).
- The letter N is not in the secret word at all (x).
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since we put E at the end and got a dash).

Important deductions:
1. The secret word starts with C (because C is correct and in position 1).
2. The secret word contains the letter E, but not at the end (position 5). So E must be in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4.
3. The letters R, A, and N are completely absent from the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Position 1: C
- Contains E (but not at position 5, and not at position 1 obviously) so in 2,3, or 4.
- Does not contain R, A, or N.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Starts with C (since position 1 is fixed).
- Does not include R, A, or N (these are out).
- Includes E (but not at position 5) and we are to try to place E in a position we haven't tried (so positions 2,3, or 4).
- We also want to test other common letters that haven't been tried yet to get more information.

Available letters: We know R, A, N are out. We have already used C and E. So we should avoid those and also avoid R,A,N.

But note: We must include E somewhere? Actually, we don't have to force it in the second guess because we already know E is in the word, but we are trying to find its position. However, including E again in a different position can help. But consider that we are limited to 5 letters and we cannot use R,A,N.

We also note that we don't know letters in positions 2,3,4,5. We only know position 1 is C and that E is present but not in the same position as before.

Good strategy: Try a word that starts with C and has E in one of the positions 2,3,4, and adds three new letters that are common and haven't been tried.

Previously we used: C, R, A, N, E. So avoid R,A,N and use new letters.

Common letters left: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

Let's think of words starting with C and having E in position 2,3, or 4.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 2: then the word would be C E _ _ _
- Position 3: then C _ E _ _
- Position 4: then C _ _ E _

We also know that E cannot be at position 5 (from the first feedback).

Let's brainstorm some words:

Option 1: E in position 2 -> words like CEIL_, CELT_, ... but we avoid R,A,N.

Words: CEILS (but that's 5 letters? CEILS is not a word? Actually, CEILS is not valid). How about:

- CEDES? But D and S are new. However, E is at position 2? But we had E in position 5 in the first guess, now we put E in position 2? That might be good.

But note: the feedback for E was dash, meaning E is in the word but not in the fifth position. So if we put E in position 2, that might be the place.

But we are not sure which position E is in, so we want to test E in a different position? Actually, putting E in position 2 would be testing a new position.

Alternatively, we can avoid repeating E? But we must include E because we know it's in the word? Actually, no rule says we must include the known letter, but it's useful to do so to find the position.

However, we can also choose a word without E to rule out other letters? But that might be inefficient because we already know E is present and we have limited guesses. So including E again is better.

We need to preserve the known information: position 1 is C and E is present.

So let's look for a word that starts with C and has E somewhere else (not position 1 and not position 5) and does not contain R, A, N.

Possible words:
- With E at position 2: CELTS (this is valid? CELT: a type of stone tool? Plural: CELTS). But wait, CELTS is 5 letters? C-E-L-T-S -> that works. And letters L,T,S are new.
- Other words: CEILS (not a word), CEDED (past form of cede, 5 letters: but D is repeated? C-E-D-E-D -> wait, that's 6 letters? No, CEDED is 5: C-E-D-E-D -> no, that has 5 letters? Positions: [C,E,D,E,D]? Actually, C-E-D-E-D is 5 letters? Word: CEDED has two E's? We don't know if the word has repeated letters.

But note: our first word was ""crane"" and had unique letters. The secret word might have duplicates? We don't know.

But the feedback: we had only one E marked as dash, which doesn't rule out more than one E. But in ""crane"", there was one E. So we don't know.

So let's consider CELTS: C-E-L-T-S. This has E at position 2. And letters L,T,S are new and not in the exclusion list (R,A,N).

Alternatively, with E at position 3: 
- Words: CHESS? Has R? No, CHESS: C-H-E-S-S -> E is at position 3. And H,S are new. But S is repeated? Let's see: C-H-E-S-S -> that is 5 letters? Yes. The word ""chess"" is 5 letters: positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:S, 5:S? Actually, no: CHESS is spelled C-H-E-S-S? That's 5: C, H, E, S (for position 4 and 5? Actually, it's C-H-E-S-S? Wait, no: the word CHESS is standardly spelled as C-H-E-S-S? I think that's correct: C at 1, H at 2, E at 3, S at 4 and S at 5? That would use two S's? But that's okay.

But note: the feedback for E was dash meaning E is present but not in the position we guessed. We guessed E at position 5 and found it's not at 5. Now we are putting E at position 3? That might be the correct position or not? We are testing.

But in CHESS, position 5 would be S? That's okay? And H is also a new letter? But what about the feedback? We are avoiding R,A,N so CHESS is okay? But CHESS has two S's? How does the feedback handle duplicates? We need to be cautious.

Another word: CLOSE? But that has O and S? And E at the end? Position: C-L-O-S-E -> E at position 5. We already know E is not at position 5? Because we got dash for E in the first guess meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's wrong? So it's a waste.

Therefore, we should avoid putting E at position 5 because we already know it's not there.

So our new guess should have E in positions 2,3, or 4.

Back to words:
- E at position 3: COPES? C-O-P-E-S -> E at position 4? Actually, position: 1:C, 2:O, 3:P, 4:E, 5:S. That would work. And letters O,P,S are new.

But we also have: CITED? But T and I are new? But I is a vowel? C-I-T-E-D -> that has E at position 4? And D. But wait, we have the letter T? That's new.

But I got another idea: Since we know E is in the word and not at 1 or 5, let's try to cover more common letters.

Common letters that haven't been tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

So a good candidate: try ""CLOSE"" but that puts E at 5? Which is bad? Because we know E is not at 5. So let's not.

Better: ""COULD"" -> but that's 5 letters? C-O-U-L-D, and E? We are skipping E? It would be better to include E to test its position.

Wait, what about ""CELLO""? But CELLO is 5 letters? C-E-L-L-O -> E at position 2? But L repeated? And O? This includes L and O? But we tested E at 2? And we can test L and O? However, if the secret word doesn't have two L's, we'll get feedback accordingly? Okay.

But let me see: We can also use ""CHEST"" -> C-H-E-S-T: E at position 3? This covers H,E,S,T? Also, no repeated letters.

Similarly, ""CHESS"" has repeated S? So ""CHEST"" is better: unique letters? But ""ch"" and then ""es"" and ""t""? Yes: C-H-E-S-T.

That sounds good? Let's see: letters: C, H, E, S, T? Avoids R,A,N? Yes.

Another word: ""CIBED""? Not standard? Or ""CEDIS"" (monetary unit)? But these are less common? It's okay? But common words are better.

So I think ""CHEST"" is a good candidate? Because:
- Starts with C (fixed)
- Has E at position 3? This tests E in a new position (position 3)
- Tests new letters H, S, T

Alternatively, if E might be at position 2? We can test E at position 2 with a word like ""CELTS""? But ""CELTS"" might be less common? But acceptable? Similarly, ""CEILI"" is not a word? So ""CELTS"" is acceptable.

Considering the feedback, we want to maximize information. Since we don't know where E is, if we place it at a position we haven't tried? We tried E at 5? So positions 2,3,4 are fresh.

So either position 2,3, or 4? So both ""CELTS"" and ""CHEST"" are okay? But ""CHEST"" tests E at position 3? We haven't tried E in a position in the middle? So it's good? Also, ""CHEST"" has more common letters.

Another candidate: ""COWER""? But wait: C-O-W-E-R -> has E and R? But we know R is absent? Because feedback for R was ""x"" meaning not in word? So we cannot use R? Therefore, ""COWER"" is invalid because it has R? Which is eliminated? So we must avoid R? And A and N? Similarly, ""CHEST"": H-E-S-T? No R,A,N? So okay?

But ""CHEST"": letters: C, H, E, S, T? And position: 
1: C (fixed and known correct? Actually, we already know C is correct at position 1? So we are testing the rest? But regardless, it's okay? Because we are required to make a new word? And we are confirming position 1? It is always good? But the feedback for C will be checkmark again? Which we don't need? But that's how the game works.

Alternatively, we can try a word with E at position 2: CEASES? no? That has A? But A is excluded? Not allowed? Because we got A with x? So no A. So no word ... how about ""CELLA""? Not common? Or ""CETYL"" too rare? ""CEDED"" has D repeated? But E at position 2? Also ""CEDED"" has E at position 2 and 4? But possibly. However, D is new? Let me check ""CEDED"": C-E-D-E-D? That is 5 letters: positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:D, 4:E, 5:D? So two E's and two D's? Then the feedback for E? It might be confusing? Because if there are two E's? But we don't know? So maybe avoid duplicates? For simplicity.

Therefore, ""CHEST"" seems a solid choice? Or ""CHEWY""? But Y? And no E in visible position? ""CHEWY"": E is at position 3? And W,Y? So okay? But ""CHEST"" uses S and T? Which are common? So better?

Similarly, ""CHOSE"": but that has O? And E at 5? But we cannot put E at 5? So invalid? Because we know E isn't at 5? So avoid words that end with E? For now? So ""CHEST"" ends with T? Good.

So I think I'll go with ""CHEST"". But let's see the letters? We are introducing H, E, S, T? And we avoid R,A,N? Yes.

Wait, but E? We know E is in the word? So we are putting it at position 3? We hope to find feedback on that.

After getting feedback on ""CHEST"", we can deduce whether E is at position 3? Or not? If we get a check on E? Then it is? Or dash? Or x? Actually, we know E is in the word? So we cannot get x? Therefore, for E: we'll either get ✓ (if at position 3) or - (if it's not at 3 but in the word? We know it's in the word). But the dash for E in the first guess meant the letter is present but not at that position? Similarly, here? If at position 3? It will be ✓? If not? Then dash? But it cannot be x? Because it's in the word? So the feedback for E will be:
- ✓: if it is at position 3? Then we know? 
- -: if it is present? But then we know it is present anyway? And if it's not at position 3? Then it must be at position 2 or 4? Because we already know it isn't at 5? And not at 1? Then if we get dash? That tells us nothing new? Except that it's not at position 3? But we already know it's present? So we learn its position isn't 3? Which is information? But we have only one position left? Or two? Position 2,3,4? So if we rule out 3? Then positions 2 and 4? And if position 2? We didn't test it? We are testing position 3? So if we get dash? Then we know E must be at 2 or 4? But we haven't tested position 2? Will position 2 be tested? In this word? We are not testing position 2? Position 2 is H? So if E were at position2? Then for ""CHEST"" the E at position3 would be not present? But E is present? What? Wait? Actually? There can only be one E? Or two? We don't know? So if E is at position2? Then for ""CHEST"":
- The E at position3? That's not in the secret word? So that's x? But wait? How does the game handle duplicates? 

Oh? Important: if the secret word has one E? And we guess a word with two E's? Then? The game's feedback only considers duplicate letters? Based on the secret word's count. In Wordle? If a letter appears one time? Then only one E is given feedback? So? Suppose the secret word has one E? Then our guess of ""teste"" might have? 

But in our case? Our first word was ""crane"" with one E? The secret word must have at least one E? But not at position5? Now? Our guess ""CHEST"" has one E? At position3? So if the secret word has E at position3? Then we get ✓? If the secret word has E at position2? Then we will get: 
- Position 3 E: not found? So an x? Because the secret word has only one E? Already highlighted elsewhere? Or? Actually? The rules: the feedback indicates for each letter if it is in the word? But? Only once? 

Clarification? How many E's? We don't know? So we have to be cautious? The feedback for ""CHEST"" if E is at position2? Then:
- C: check? Because position1 is C? 
- H: if the secret word doesn't have H? Then x? 
- E: at position3? The secret word has an E? But at position2? So? Then the E at position3? Since it's not matching? And the secret word has only one E? Then the E in our guess would be marked? Position3: x? Because the E is already recognized at? Wait? But the positions? 

Actually? The feedback:
- The secret word has E? Then a dash for E? If it appears elsewhere? So? For ""CHEST"": 
  If E is at position2? Then:
    Position1: C -> ✓? 
    Position2: H -> but the secret word has E? So H at position2? Might be not E? So x? 
    Position3: E -> but the secret word has E at position2? Only? Then E at position3? Is not matching? Since E is already covered by the one at position2? So we get x? 

But let me check an example? Suppose secret word: CREEP? Not applicable? Because we only have one E? 

But we need to understand? The rules: if the letter is present? And not matched? Then dash? But in the first guess? We had E at position5? But E is present? But not at5? So dash? Then? Similarly? For E? It gets a dash per occurrence? If there are duplicates? 

But for simplicity? Since we don't know if there is more than one E? Then? In ""CHEST"": 
- If E is at position2? Then for our E at position3? We might get dash if there are two E's? Or x if only one E? Because the E was already counted at position2? 

I think? The game marks both as follows? 
- First? Find exact matches? So position? Then? From left? Any letter not matched? But in the word? Gets a dash? And any letter not in word? Gets x? 

So? If the secret word has one E? Then?
Guess1: E? Not exact? But E is present? So dash? Then?
Guess2: E again? If placed correctly? Check? Otherwise? Dash or x? 

Wait? But if the secret word has one E? And we guess two E's? Then? If one E is exactly at the right position? Then the other? E? That isn't? Will be marked x? Because? When parsing? The exact matched E is counted? Then? The other E? In our guess? Is not in the word? Because? The secret word has only one E? Which was already matched? So? The other E gets x? 

But if the secret word has two E's? Then? Both E's? Could be matches or dashes? 

Given? We only knew? E is somewhere? So we don't know the count? 

But in CHEST? Only one E? So? In secret word? If E is at position2? Then? 
Our guess: 
- Position1: C? Correct? 
- Position2: H? Is it E? Or something else? 
- Position3: E? 
The secret? Position1: C? Position2: E? Position3: something? 
So? 
- Position1: C? Matches? So ✓? 
- Position2: H? Secret has E at2? So? E is not H? But H is not E? And H? So? Is H in the word? Not E? But? The secret word at position2 is E? So? Letter H? It may or may not be in the word? Maybe not? 

Actually? For position2: H? 
If H is not in the secret word? Then x? 
And position3: E? The secret has E but at position2? So? E at position3? The secret has E at position2? But? Position3 is not E? So? The E? In guess position3? Is not matching? And? Because? There's only one E? Which was already used? So? We get x? Or dash? 

This becomes complex? 

Alternatively? We can avoid duplicates to reduce complexity? Therefore? Choose a word with E only once? And in a previously uncovered position? 

But I think? It's safer to choose a word that puts E in a position where we have not tried? And doesn't introduce duplicates? 

So? Back to? ""CLOSE"" puts E at5? Which is bad? So avoid? 

Word ""CHEAP""? But has A? Which is excluded? Because A was x? So no? 

""CHEST"" is good? 
- Doesn't have A? Doesn't have R? Doesn't have N? 
- Has E at position3? 
- New letters: H, S, T? 

Therefore? Let's guess ""CHEST""? 

But wait? What about ""CEDED""? I think? Let's check? 

Better? Use? ""CELLO"": 
C E L L O? E at position2? And L? But two L's? So? That might be confusing? 

Alternatively? ""CETUS?"" not common? 

So? ""CHEST"" it is? Or ""CHUTE""? 
""CHUTE"": C-H-U-T-E? But E at5? Which we know it's not? So avoid? 

Therefore? I'll go with? ""CHEST""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""cra ne"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all (x).
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (-).

This means:
1. The secret word starts with C.
2. E is present but must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
3. R, A, and N cannot appear in any subsequent guesses.

For the second guess:
- Start with C (position 1 is fixed).
- Include E in position 2, 3, or 4 to test new positions.
- Use new common letters not yet tested (avoid R, A, N).
- Avoid placing E in position 5.

After considering options like ""CELTS"" and ""CHEAP"" (which contains excluded A), ""CHEST"" was chosen:
- Starts with C (meeting position 1).
- Positions E at position 3 (untested position).
- Introduces new common letters: H (position 2), S (position 4), T (position 5).
- Avoids R, A, N and reused letters from incorrect positions.

This guess maximizes new information by testing E's position and covering additional common consonants.

<guess>chest</guess>",chest,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Interpretation:
- The letter C is in the secret word and is in the first position (since we got a checkmark).
- The letter R is not in the secret word at all (x).
- The letter A is not in the secret word at all (x).
- The letter N is not in the secret word at all (x).
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since we put E at the end and got a dash).

Important deductions:
1. The secret word starts with C (because C is correct and in position 1).
2. The secret word contains the letter E, but not at the end (position 5). So E must be in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4.
3. The letters R, A, and N are completely absent from the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Position 1: C
- Contains E (but not at position 5, and not at position 1 obviously) so in 2,3, or 4.
- Does not contain R, A, or N.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Starts with C (since position 1 is fixed).
- Does not include R, A, or N (these are out).
- Includes E (but not at position 5) and we are to try to place E in a position we haven't tried (so positions 2,3, or 4).
- We also want to test other common letters that haven't been tried yet to get more information.

Available letters: We know R, A, N are out. We have already used C and E. So we should avoid those and also avoid R,A,N.

But note: We must include E somewhere? Actually, we don't have to force it in the second guess because we already know E is in the word, but we are trying to find its position. However, including E again in a different position can help. But consider that we are limited to 5 letters and we cannot use R,A,N.

We also note that we don't know letters in positions 2,3,4,5. We only know position 1 is C and that E is present but not in the same position as before.

Good strategy: Try a word that starts with C and has E in one of the positions 2,3,4, and adds three new letters that are common and haven't been tried.

Previously we used: C, R, A, N, E. So avoid R,A,N and use new letters.

Common letters left: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

Let's think of words starting with C and having E in position 2,3, or 4.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 2: then the word would be C E _ _ _
- Position 3: then C _ E _ _
- Position 4: then C _ _ E _

We also know that E cannot be at position 5 (from the first feedback).

Let's brainstorm some words:

Option 1: E in position 2 -> words like CEIL_, CELT_, ... but we avoid R,A,N.

Words: CEILS (but that's 5 letters? CEILS is not a word? Actually, CEILS is not valid). How about:

- CEDES? But D and S are new. However, E is at position 2? But we had E in position 5 in the first guess, now we put E in position 2? That might be good.

But note: the feedback for E was dash, meaning E is in the word but not in the fifth position. So if we put E in position 2, that might be the place.

But we are not sure which position E is in, so we want to test E in a different position? Actually, putting E in position 2 would be testing a new position.

Alternatively, we can avoid repeating E? But we must include E because we know it's in the word? Actually, no rule says we must include the known letter, but it's useful to do so to find the position.

However, we can also choose a word without E to rule out other letters? But that might be inefficient because we already know E is present and we have limited guesses. So including E again is better.

We need to preserve the known information: position 1 is C and E is present.

So let's look for a word that starts with C and has E somewhere else (not position 1 and not position 5) and does not contain R, A, N.

Possible words:
- With E at position 2: CELTS (this is valid? CELT: a type of stone tool? Plural: CELTS). But wait, CELTS is 5 letters? C-E-L-T-S -> that works. And letters L,T,S are new.
- Other words: CEILS (not a word), CEDED (past form of cede, 5 letters: but D is repeated? C-E-D-E-D -> wait, that's 6 letters? No, CEDED is 5: C-E-D-E-D -> no, that has 5 letters? Positions: [C,E,D,E,D]? Actually, C-E-D-E-D is 5 letters? Word: CEDED has two E's? We don't know if the word has repeated letters.

But note: our first word was ""crane"" and had unique letters. The secret word might have duplicates? We don't know.

But the feedback: we had only one E marked as dash, which doesn't rule out more than one E. But in ""crane"", there was one E. So we don't know.

So let's consider CELTS: C-E-L-T-S. This has E at position 2. And letters L,T,S are new and not in the exclusion list (R,A,N).

Alternatively, with E at position 3: 
- Words: CHESS? Has R? No, CHESS: C-H-E-S-S -> E is at position 3. And H,S are new. But S is repeated? Let's see: C-H-E-S-S -> that is 5 letters? Yes. The word ""chess"" is 5 letters: positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:S, 5:S? Actually, no: CHESS is spelled C-H-E-S-S? That's 5: C, H, E, S (for position 4 and 5? Actually, it's C-H-E-S-S? Wait, no: the word CHESS is standardly spelled as C-H-E-S-S? I think that's correct: C at 1, H at 2, E at 3, S at 4 and S at 5? That would use two S's? But that's okay.

But note: the feedback for E was dash meaning E is present but not in the position we guessed. We guessed E at position 5 and found it's not at 5. Now we are putting E at position 3? That might be the correct position or not? We are testing.

But in CHESS, position 5 would be S? That's okay? And H is also a new letter? But what about the feedback? We are avoiding R,A,N so CHESS is okay? But CHESS has two S's? How does the feedback handle duplicates? We need to be cautious.

Another word: CLOSE? But that has O and S? And E at the end? Position: C-L-O-S-E -> E at position 5. We already know E is not at position 5? Because we got dash for E in the first guess meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's wrong? So it's a waste.

Therefore, we should avoid putting E at position 5 because we already know it's not there.

So our new guess should have E in positions 2,3, or 4.

Back to words:
- E at position 3: COPES? C-O-P-E-S -> E at position 4? Actually, position: 1:C, 2:O, 3:P, 4:E, 5:S. That would work. And letters O,P,S are new.

But we also have: CITED? But T and I are new? But I is a vowel? C-I-T-E-D -> that has E at position 4? And D. But wait, we have the letter T? That's new.

But I got another idea: Since we know E is in the word and not at 1 or 5, let's try to cover more common letters.

Common letters that haven't been tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

So a good candidate: try ""CLOSE"" but that puts E at 5? Which is bad? Because we know E is not at 5. So let's not.

Better: ""COULD"" -> but that's 5 letters? C-O-U-L-D, and E? We are skipping E? It would be better to include E to test its position.

Wait, what about ""CELLO""? But CELLO is 5 letters? C-E-L-L-O -> E at position 2? But L repeated? And O? This includes L and O? But we tested E at 2? And we can test L and O? However, if the secret word doesn't have two L's, we'll get feedback accordingly? Okay.

But let me see: We can also use ""CHEST"" -> C-H-E-S-T: E at position 3? This covers H,E,S,T? Also, no repeated letters.

Similarly, ""CHESS"" has repeated S? So ""CHEST"" is better: unique letters? But ""ch"" and then ""es"" and ""t""? Yes: C-H-E-S-T.

That sounds good? Let's see: letters: C, H, E, S, T? Avoids R,A,N? Yes.

Another word: ""CIBED""? Not standard? Or ""CEDIS"" (monetary unit)? But these are less common? It's okay? But common words are better.

So I think ""CHEST"" is a good candidate? Because:
- Starts with C (fixed)
- Has E at position 3? This tests E in a new position (position 3)
- Tests new letters H, S, T

Alternatively, if E might be at position 2? We can test E at position 2 with a word like ""CELTS""? But ""CELTS"" might be less common? But acceptable? Similarly, ""CEILI"" is not a word? So ""CELTS"" is acceptable.

Considering the feedback, we want to maximize information. Since we don't know where E is, if we place it at a position we haven't tried? We tried E at 5? So positions 2,3,4 are fresh.

So either position 2,3, or 4? So both ""CELTS"" and ""CHEST"" are okay? But ""CHEST"" tests E at position 3? We haven't tried E in a position in the middle? So it's good? Also, ""CHEST"" has more common letters.

Another candidate: ""COWER""? But wait: C-O-W-E-R -> has E and R? But we know R is absent? Because feedback for R was ""x"" meaning not in word? So we cannot use R? Therefore, ""COWER"" is invalid because it has R? Which is eliminated? So we must avoid R? And A and N? Similarly, ""CHEST"": H-E-S-T? No R,A,N? So okay?

But ""CHEST"": letters: C, H, E, S, T? And position: 
1: C (fixed and known correct? Actually, we already know C is correct at position 1? So we are testing the rest? But regardless, it's okay? Because we are required to make a new word? And we are confirming position 1? It is always good? But the feedback for C will be checkmark again? Which we don't need? But that's how the game works.

Alternatively, we can try a word with E at position 2: CEASES? no? That has A? But A is excluded? Not allowed? Because we got A with x? So no A. So no word ... how about ""CELLA""? Not common? Or ""CETYL"" too rare? ""CEDED"" has D repeated? But E at position 2? Also ""CEDED"" has E at position 2 and 4? But possibly. However, D is new? Let me check ""CEDED"": C-E-D-E-D? That is 5 letters: positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:D, 4:E, 5:D? So two E's and two D's? Then the feedback for E? It might be confusing? Because if there are two E's? But we don't know? So maybe avoid duplicates? For simplicity.

Therefore, ""CHEST"" seems a solid choice? Or ""CHEWY""? But Y? And no E in visible position? ""CHEWY"": E is at position 3? And W,Y? So okay? But ""CHEST"" uses S and T? Which are common? So better?

Similarly, ""CHOSE"": but that has O? And E at 5? But we cannot put E at 5? So invalid? Because we know E isn't at 5? So avoid words that end with E? For now? So ""CHEST"" ends with T? Good.

So I think I'll go with ""CHEST"". But let's see the letters? We are introducing H, E, S, T? And we avoid R,A,N? Yes.

Wait, but E? We know E is in the word? So we are putting it at position 3? We hope to find feedback on that.

After getting feedback on ""CHEST"", we can deduce whether E is at position 3? Or not? If we get a check on E? Then it is? Or dash? Or x? Actually, we know E is in the word? So we cannot get x? Therefore, for E: we'll either get ✓ (if at position 3) or - (if it's not at 3 but in the word? We know it's in the word). But the dash for E in the first guess meant the letter is present but not at that position? Similarly, here? If at position 3? It will be ✓? If not? Then dash? But it cannot be x? Because it's in the word? So the feedback for E will be:
- ✓: if it is at position 3? Then we know? 
- -: if it is present? But then we know it is present anyway? And if it's not at position 3? Then it must be at position 2 or 4? Because we already know it isn't at 5? And not at 1? Then if we get dash? That tells us nothing new? Except that it's not at position 3? But we already know it's present? So we learn its position isn't 3? Which is information? But we have only one position left? Or two? Position 2,3,4? So if we rule out 3? Then positions 2 and 4? And if position 2? We didn't test it? We are testing position 3? So if we get dash? Then we know E must be at 2 or 4? But we haven't tested position 2? Will position 2 be tested? In this word? We are not testing position 2? Position 2 is H? So if E were at position2? Then for ""CHEST"" the E at position3 would be not present? But E is present? What? Wait? Actually? There can only be one E? Or two? We don't know? So if E is at position2? Then for ""CHEST"":
- The E at position3? That's not in the secret word? So that's x? But wait? How does the game handle duplicates? 

Oh? Important: if the secret word has one E? And we guess a word with two E's? Then? The game's feedback only considers duplicate letters? Based on the secret word's count. In Wordle? If a letter appears one time? Then only one E is given feedback? So? Suppose the secret word has one E? Then our guess of ""teste"" might have? 

But in our case? Our first word was ""crane"" with one E? The secret word must have at least one E? But not at position5? Now? Our guess ""CHEST"" has one E? At position3? So if the secret word has E at position3? Then we get ✓? If the secret word has E at position2? Then we will get: 
- Position 3 E: not found? So an x? Because the secret word has only one E? Already highlighted elsewhere? Or? Actually? The rules: the feedback indicates for each letter if it is in the word? But? Only once? 

Clarification? How many E's? We don't know? So we have to be cautious? The feedback for ""CHEST"" if E is at position2? Then:
- C: check? Because position1 is C? 
- H: if the secret word doesn't have H? Then x? 
- E: at position3? The secret word has an E? But at position2? So? Then the E at position3? Since it's not matching? And the secret word has only one E? Then the E in our guess would be marked? Position3: x? Because the E is already recognized at? Wait? But the positions? 

Actually? The feedback:
- The secret word has E? Then a dash for E? If it appears elsewhere? So? For ""CHEST"": 
  If E is at position2? Then:
    Position1: C -> ✓? 
    Position2: H -> but the secret word has E? So H at position2? Might be not E? So x? 
    Position3: E -> but the secret word has E at position2? Only? Then E at position3? Is not matching? Since E is already covered by the one at position2? So we get x? 

But let me check an example? Suppose secret word: CREEP? Not applicable? Because we only have one E? 

But we need to understand? The rules: if the letter is present? And not matched? Then dash? But in the first guess? We had E at position5? But E is present? But not at5? So dash? Then? Similarly? For E? It gets a dash per occurrence? If there are duplicates? 

But for simplicity? Since we don't know if there is more than one E? Then? In ""CHEST"": 
- If E is at position2? Then for our E at position3? We might get dash if there are two E's? Or x if only one E? Because the E was already counted at position2? 

I think? The game marks both as follows? 
- First? Find exact matches? So position? Then? From left? Any letter not matched? But in the word? Gets a dash? And any letter not in word? Gets x? 

So? If the secret word has one E? Then?
Guess1: E? Not exact? But E is present? So dash? Then?
Guess2: E again? If placed correctly? Check? Otherwise? Dash or x? 

Wait? But if the secret word has one E? And we guess two E's? Then? If one E is exactly at the right position? Then the other? E? That isn't? Will be marked x? Because? When parsing? The exact matched E is counted? Then? The other E? In our guess? Is not in the word? Because? The secret word has only one E? Which was already matched? So? The other E gets x? 

But if the secret word has two E's? Then? Both E's? Could be matches or dashes? 

Given? We only knew? E is somewhere? So we don't know the count? 

But in CHEST? Only one E? So? In secret word? If E is at position2? Then? 
Our guess: 
- Position1: C? Correct? 
- Position2: H? Is it E? Or something else? 
- Position3: E? 
The secret? Position1: C? Position2: E? Position3: something? 
So? 
- Position1: C? Matches? So ✓? 
- Position2: H? Secret has E at2? So? E is not H? But H is not E? And H? So? Is H in the word? Not E? But? The secret word at position2 is E? So? Letter H? It may or may not be in the word? Maybe not? 

Actually? For position2: H? 
If H is not in the secret word? Then x? 
And position3: E? The secret has E but at position2? So? E at position3? The secret has E at position2? But? Position3 is not E? So? The E? In guess position3? Is not matching? And? Because? There's only one E? Which was already used? So? We get x? Or dash? 

This becomes complex? 

Alternatively? We can avoid duplicates to reduce complexity? Therefore? Choose a word with E only once? And in a previously uncovered position? 

But I think? It's safer to choose a word that puts E in a position where we have not tried? And doesn't introduce duplicates? 

So? Back to? ""CLOSE"" puts E at5? Which is bad? So avoid? 

Word ""CHEAP""? But has A? Which is excluded? Because A was x? So no? 

""CHEST"" is good? 
- Doesn't have A? Doesn't have R? Doesn't have N? 
- Has E at position3? 
- New letters: H, S, T? 

Therefore? Let's guess ""CHEST""? 

But wait? What about ""CEDED""? I think? Let's check? 

Better? Use? ""CELLO"": 
C E L L O? E at position2? And L? But two L's? So? That might be confusing? 

Alternatively? ""CETUS?"" not common? 

So? ""CHEST"" it is? Or ""CHUTE""? 
""CHUTE"": C-H-U-T-E? But E at5? Which we know it's not? So avoid? 

Therefore? I'll go with? ""CHEST""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""cra ne"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all (x).
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (-).

This means:
1. The secret word starts with C.
2. E is present but must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
3. R, A, and N cannot appear in any subsequent guesses.

For the second guess:
- Start with C (position 1 is fixed).
- Include E in position 2, 3, or 4 to test new positions.
- Use new common letters not yet tested (avoid R, A, N).
- Avoid placing E in position 5.

After considering options like ""CELTS"" and ""CHEAP"" (which contains excluded A), ""CHEST"" was chosen:
- Starts with C (meeting position 1).
- Positions E at position 3 (untested position).
- Introduces new common letters: H (position 2), S (position 4), T (position 5).
- Avoids R, A, N and reused letters from incorrect positions.

This guess maximizes new information by testing E's position and covering additional common consonants.",Guess 2: chest -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) E(-) S(x) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,cello,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and positions.
 A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. 
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E).
   - It covers letters that frequently appear in 5-letter words.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Interpretation:
- The letter C is in the secret word and is in the first position (since we got a checkmark).
- The letter R is not in the secret word at all (x).
- The letter A is not in the secret word at all (x).
- The letter N is not in the secret word at all (x).
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since we put E at the end and got a dash).

Important deductions:
1. The secret word starts with C (because C is correct and in position 1).
2. The secret word contains the letter E, but not at the end (position 5). So E must be in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4.
3. The letters R, A, and N are completely absent from the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Position 1: C
- Contains E (but not at position 5, and not at position 1 obviously) so in 2,3, or 4.
- Does not contain R, A, or N.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Starts with C (since position 1 is fixed).
- Does not include R, A, or N (these are out).
- Includes E (but not at position 5) and we are to try to place E in a position we haven't tried (so positions 2,3, or 4).
- We also want to test other common letters that haven't been tried yet to get more information.

Available letters: We know R, A, N are out. We have already used C and E. So we should avoid those and also avoid R,A,N.

But note: We must include E somewhere? Actually, we don't have to force it in the second guess because we already know E is in the word, but we are trying to find its position. However, including E again in a different position can help. But consider that we are limited to 5 letters and we cannot use R,A,N.

We also note that we don't know letters in positions 2,3,4,5. We only know position 1 is C and that E is present but not in the same position as before.

Good strategy: Try a word that starts with C and has E in one of the positions 2,3,4, and adds three new letters that are common and haven't been tried.

Previously we used: C, R, A, N, E. So avoid R,A,N and use new letters.

Common letters left: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

Let's think of words starting with C and having E in position 2,3, or 4.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 2: then the word would be C E _ _ _
- Position 3: then C _ E _ _
- Position 4: then C _ _ E _

We also know that E cannot be at position 5 (from the first feedback).

Let's brainstorm some words:

Option 1: E in position 2 -> words like CEIL_, CELT_, ... but we avoid R,A,N.

Words: CEILS (but that's 5 letters? CEILS is not a word? Actually, CEILS is not valid). How about:

- CEDES? But D and S are new. However, E is at position 2? But we had E in position 5 in the first guess, now we put E in position 2? That might be good.

But note: the feedback for E was dash, meaning E is in the word but not in the fifth position. So if we put E in position 2, that might be the place.

But we are not sure which position E is in, so we want to test E in a different position? Actually, putting E in position 2 would be testing a new position.

Alternatively, we can avoid repeating E? But we must include E because we know it's in the word? Actually, no rule says we must include the known letter, but it's useful to do so to find the position.

However, we can also choose a word without E to rule out other letters? But that might be inefficient because we already know E is present and we have limited guesses. So including E again is better.

We need to preserve the known information: position 1 is C and E is present.

So let's look for a word that starts with C and has E somewhere else (not position 1 and not position 5) and does not contain R, A, N.

Possible words:
- With E at position 2: CELTS (this is valid? CELT: a type of stone tool? Plural: CELTS). But wait, CELTS is 5 letters? C-E-L-T-S -> that works. And letters L,T,S are new.
- Other words: CEILS (not a word), CEDED (past form of cede, 5 letters: but D is repeated? C-E-D-E-D -> wait, that's 6 letters? No, CEDED is 5: C-E-D-E-D -> no, that has 5 letters? Positions: [C,E,D,E,D]? Actually, C-E-D-E-D is 5 letters? Word: CEDED has two E's? We don't know if the word has repeated letters.

But note: our first word was ""crane"" and had unique letters. The secret word might have duplicates? We don't know.

But the feedback: we had only one E marked as dash, which doesn't rule out more than one E. But in ""crane"", there was one E. So we don't know.

So let's consider CELTS: C-E-L-T-S. This has E at position 2. And letters L,T,S are new and not in the exclusion list (R,A,N).

Alternatively, with E at position 3: 
- Words: CHESS? Has R? No, CHESS: C-H-E-S-S -> E is at position 3. And H,S are new. But S is repeated? Let's see: C-H-E-S-S -> that is 5 letters? Yes. The word ""chess"" is 5 letters: positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:S, 5:S? Actually, no: CHESS is spelled C-H-E-S-S? That's 5: C, H, E, S (for position 4 and 5? Actually, it's C-H-E-S-S? Wait, no: the word CHESS is standardly spelled as C-H-E-S-S? I think that's correct: C at 1, H at 2, E at 3, S at 4 and S at 5? That would use two S's? But that's okay.

But note: the feedback for E was dash meaning E is present but not in the position we guessed. We guessed E at position 5 and found it's not at 5. Now we are putting E at position 3? That might be the correct position or not? We are testing.

But in CHESS, position 5 would be S? That's okay? And H is also a new letter? But what about the feedback? We are avoiding R,A,N so CHESS is okay? But CHESS has two S's? How does the feedback handle duplicates? We need to be cautious.

Another word: CLOSE? But that has O and S? And E at the end? Position: C-L-O-S-E -> E at position 5. We already know E is not at position 5? Because we got dash for E in the first guess meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's wrong? So it's a waste.

Therefore, we should avoid putting E at position 5 because we already know it's not there.

So our new guess should have E in positions 2,3, or 4.

Back to words:
- E at position 3: COPES? C-O-P-E-S -> E at position 4? Actually, position: 1:C, 2:O, 3:P, 4:E, 5:S. That would work. And letters O,P,S are new.

But we also have: CITED? But T and I are new? But I is a vowel? C-I-T-E-D -> that has E at position 4? And D. But wait, we have the letter T? That's new.

But I got another idea: Since we know E is in the word and not at 1 or 5, let's try to cover more common letters.

Common letters that haven't been tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

So a good candidate: try ""CLOSE"" but that puts E at 5? Which is bad? Because we know E is not at 5. So let's not.

Better: ""COULD"" -> but that's 5 letters? C-O-U-L-D, and E? We are skipping E? It would be better to include E to test its position.

Wait, what about ""CELLO""? But CELLO is 5 letters? C-E-L-L-O -> E at position 2? But L repeated? And O? This includes L and O? But we tested E at 2? And we can test L and O? However, if the secret word doesn't have two L's, we'll get feedback accordingly? Okay.

But let me see: We can also use ""CHEST"" -> C-H-E-S-T: E at position 3? This covers H,E,S,T? Also, no repeated letters.

Similarly, ""CHESS"" has repeated S? So ""CHEST"" is better: unique letters? But ""ch"" and then ""es"" and ""t""? Yes: C-H-E-S-T.

That sounds good? Let's see: letters: C, H, E, S, T? Avoids R,A,N? Yes.

Another word: ""CIBED""? Not standard? Or ""CEDIS"" (monetary unit)? But these are less common? It's okay? But common words are better.

So I think ""CHEST"" is a good candidate? Because:
- Starts with C (fixed)
- Has E at position 3? This tests E in a new position (position 3)
- Tests new letters H, S, T

Alternatively, if E might be at position 2? We can test E at position 2 with a word like ""CELTS""? But ""CELTS"" might be less common? But acceptable? Similarly, ""CEILI"" is not a word? So ""CELTS"" is acceptable.

Considering the feedback, we want to maximize information. Since we don't know where E is, if we place it at a position we haven't tried? We tried E at 5? So positions 2,3,4 are fresh.

So either position 2,3, or 4? So both ""CELTS"" and ""CHEST"" are okay? But ""CHEST"" tests E at position 3? We haven't tried E in a position in the middle? So it's good? Also, ""CHEST"" has more common letters.

Another candidate: ""COWER""? But wait: C-O-W-E-R -> has E and R? But we know R is absent? Because feedback for R was ""x"" meaning not in word? So we cannot use R? Therefore, ""COWER"" is invalid because it has R? Which is eliminated? So we must avoid R? And A and N? Similarly, ""CHEST"": H-E-S-T? No R,A,N? So okay?

But ""CHEST"": letters: C, H, E, S, T? And position: 
1: C (fixed and known correct? Actually, we already know C is correct at position 1? So we are testing the rest? But regardless, it's okay? Because we are required to make a new word? And we are confirming position 1? It is always good? But the feedback for C will be checkmark again? Which we don't need? But that's how the game works.

Alternatively, we can try a word with E at position 2: CEASES? no? That has A? But A is excluded? Not allowed? Because we got A with x? So no A. So no word ... how about ""CELLA""? Not common? Or ""CETYL"" too rare? ""CEDED"" has D repeated? But E at position 2? Also ""CEDED"" has E at position 2 and 4? But possibly. However, D is new? Let me check ""CEDED"": C-E-D-E-D? That is 5 letters: positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:D, 4:E, 5:D? So two E's and two D's? Then the feedback for E? It might be confusing? Because if there are two E's? But we don't know? So maybe avoid duplicates? For simplicity.

Therefore, ""CHEST"" seems a solid choice? Or ""CHEWY""? But Y? And no E in visible position? ""CHEWY"": E is at position 3? And W,Y? So okay? But ""CHEST"" uses S and T? Which are common? So better?

Similarly, ""CHOSE"": but that has O? And E at 5? But we cannot put E at 5? So invalid? Because we know E isn't at 5? So avoid words that end with E? For now? So ""CHEST"" ends with T? Good.

So I think I'll go with ""CHEST"". But let's see the letters? We are introducing H, E, S, T? And we avoid R,A,N? Yes.

Wait, but E? We know E is in the word? So we are putting it at position 3? We hope to find feedback on that.

After getting feedback on ""CHEST"", we can deduce whether E is at position 3? Or not? If we get a check on E? Then it is? Or dash? Or x? Actually, we know E is in the word? So we cannot get x? Therefore, for E: we'll either get ✓ (if at position 3) or - (if it's not at 3 but in the word? We know it's in the word). But the dash for E in the first guess meant the letter is present but not at that position? Similarly, here? If at position 3? It will be ✓? If not? Then dash? But it cannot be x? Because it's in the word? So the feedback for E will be:
- ✓: if it is at position 3? Then we know? 
- -: if it is present? But then we know it is present anyway? And if it's not at position 3? Then it must be at position 2 or 4? Because we already know it isn't at 5? And not at 1? Then if we get dash? That tells us nothing new? Except that it's not at position 3? But we already know it's present? So we learn its position isn't 3? Which is information? But we have only one position left? Or two? Position 2,3,4? So if we rule out 3? Then positions 2 and 4? And if position 2? We didn't test it? We are testing position 3? So if we get dash? Then we know E must be at 2 or 4? But we haven't tested position 2? Will position 2 be tested? In this word? We are not testing position 2? Position 2 is H? So if E were at position2? Then for ""CHEST"" the E at position3 would be not present? But E is present? What? Wait? Actually? There can only be one E? Or two? We don't know? So if E is at position2? Then for ""CHEST"":
- The E at position3? That's not in the secret word? So that's x? But wait? How does the game handle duplicates? 

Oh? Important: if the secret word has one E? And we guess a word with two E's? Then? The game's feedback only considers duplicate letters? Based on the secret word's count. In Wordle? If a letter appears one time? Then only one E is given feedback? So? Suppose the secret word has one E? Then our guess of ""teste"" might have? 

But in our case? Our first word was ""crane"" with one E? The secret word must have at least one E? But not at position5? Now? Our guess ""CHEST"" has one E? At position3? So if the secret word has E at position3? Then we get ✓? If the secret word has E at position2? Then we will get: 
- Position 3 E: not found? So an x? Because the secret word has only one E? Already highlighted elsewhere? Or? Actually? The rules: the feedback indicates for each letter if it is in the word? But? Only once? 

Clarification? How many E's? We don't know? So we have to be cautious? The feedback for ""CHEST"" if E is at position2? Then:
- C: check? Because position1 is C? 
- H: if the secret word doesn't have H? Then x? 
- E: at position3? The secret word has an E? But at position2? So? Then the E at position3? Since it's not matching? And the secret word has only one E? Then the E in our guess would be marked? Position3: x? Because the E is already recognized at? Wait? But the positions? 

Actually? The feedback:
- The secret word has E? Then a dash for E? If it appears elsewhere? So? For ""CHEST"": 
  If E is at position2? Then:
    Position1: C -> ✓? 
    Position2: H -> but the secret word has E? So H at position2? Might be not E? So x? 
    Position3: E -> but the secret word has E at position2? Only? Then E at position3? Is not matching? Since E is already covered by the one at position2? So we get x? 

But let me check an example? Suppose secret word: CREEP? Not applicable? Because we only have one E? 

But we need to understand? The rules: if the letter is present? And not matched? Then dash? But in the first guess? We had E at position5? But E is present? But not at5? So dash? Then? Similarly? For E? It gets a dash per occurrence? If there are duplicates? 

But for simplicity? Since we don't know if there is more than one E? Then? In ""CHEST"": 
- If E is at position2? Then for our E at position3? We might get dash if there are two E's? Or x if only one E? Because the E was already counted at position2? 

I think? The game marks both as follows? 
- First? Find exact matches? So position? Then? From left? Any letter not matched? But in the word? Gets a dash? And any letter not in word? Gets x? 

So? If the secret word has one E? Then?
Guess1: E? Not exact? But E is present? So dash? Then?
Guess2: E again? If placed correctly? Check? Otherwise? Dash or x? 

Wait? But if the secret word has one E? And we guess two E's? Then? If one E is exactly at the right position? Then the other? E? That isn't? Will be marked x? Because? When parsing? The exact matched E is counted? Then? The other E? In our guess? Is not in the word? Because? The secret word has only one E? Which was already matched? So? The other E gets x? 

But if the secret word has two E's? Then? Both E's? Could be matches or dashes? 

Given? We only knew? E is somewhere? So we don't know the count? 

But in CHEST? Only one E? So? In secret word? If E is at position2? Then? 
Our guess: 
- Position1: C? Correct? 
- Position2: H? Is it E? Or something else? 
- Position3: E? 
The secret? Position1: C? Position2: E? Position3: something? 
So? 
- Position1: C? Matches? So ✓? 
- Position2: H? Secret has E at2? So? E is not H? But H is not E? And H? So? Is H in the word? Not E? But? The secret word at position2 is E? So? Letter H? It may or may not be in the word? Maybe not? 

Actually? For position2: H? 
If H is not in the secret word? Then x? 
And position3: E? The secret has E but at position2? So? E at position3? The secret has E at position2? But? Position3 is not E? So? The E? In guess position3? Is not matching? And? Because? There's only one E? Which was already used? So? We get x? Or dash? 

This becomes complex? 

Alternatively? We can avoid duplicates to reduce complexity? Therefore? Choose a word with E only once? And in a previously uncovered position? 

But I think? It's safer to choose a word that puts E in a position where we have not tried? And doesn't introduce duplicates? 

So? Back to? ""CLOSE"" puts E at5? Which is bad? So avoid? 

Word ""CHEAP""? But has A? Which is excluded? Because A was x? So no? 

""CHEST"" is good? 
- Doesn't have A? Doesn't have R? Doesn't have N? 
- Has E at position3? 
- New letters: H, S, T? 

Therefore? Let's guess ""CHEST""? 

But wait? What about ""CEDED""? I think? Let's check? 

Better? Use? ""CELLO"": 
C E L L O? E at position2? And L? But two L's? So? That might be confusing? 

Alternatively? ""CETUS?"" not common? 

So? ""CHEST"" it is? Or ""CHUTE""? 
""CHUTE"": C-H-U-T-E? But E at5? Which we know it's not? So avoid? 

Therefore? I'll go with? ""CHEST""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""cra ne"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all (x).
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (-).

This means:
1. The secret word starts with C.
2. E is present but must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
3. R, A, and N cannot appear in any subsequent guesses.

For the second guess:
- Start with C (position 1 is fixed).
- Include E in position 2, 3, or 4 to test new positions.
- Use new common letters not yet tested (avoid R, A, N).
- Avoid placing E in position 5.

After considering options like ""CELTS"" and ""CHEAP"" (which contains excluded A), ""CHEST"" was chosen:
- Starts with C (meeting position 1).
- Positions E at position 3 (untested position).
- Introduces new common letters: H (position 2), S (position 4), T (position 5).
- Avoids R, A, N and reused letters from incorrect positions.

This guess maximizes new information by testing E's position and covering additional common consonants.

The secret word starts with C (because C is correct and in position 1).\n2. The secret word contains the letter E, but not at the end (position 5). So E must be in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4.\n3. The letters R, A, and N are completely absent from the secret word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word:\n- Position 1: C\n- Contains E (but not at position 5, and not at position 1 obviously) so in 2,3, or 4.\n- Does not contain R, A, or N.\n\nWe need to make a second guess that:\n- Starts with C (since position 1 is fixed).\n- Does not include R, A, or N (these are out).\n- Includes E (but not at position 5) and we are to try to place E in a position we haven\'t tried (so positions 2,3, or 4).\n- We also want to test other common letters that haven\'t been tried yet to get more information.\n\nAvailable letters: We know R, A, N are out. We have already used C and E. So we should avoid those and also avoid R,A,N.\n\nBut note: We must include E somewhere? Actually, we don\'t have to force it in the second guess because we already know E is in the word, but we are trying to find its position. However, including E again in a different position can help. But consider that we are limited to 5 letters and we cannot use R,A,N.\n\nWe also note that we don\'t know letters in positions 2,3,4,5. We only know position 1 is C and that E is present but not in the same position as before.\n\nGood strategy: Try a word that starts with C and has E in one of the positions 2,3,4, and adds three new letters that are common and haven\'t been tried.\n\nPreviously we used: C, R, A, N, E. So avoid R,A,N and use new letters.\n\nCommon letters left: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\nLet\'s think of words starting with C and having E in position 2,3, or 4.\n\nPossible positions for E:\n- Position 2: then the word would be C E _ _ _\n- Position 3: then C _ E _ _\n- Position 4: then C _ _ E _\n\nWe also know that E cannot be at position 5 (from the first feedback).\n\nLet\'s brainstorm some words:\n\nOption 1: E in position 2 -> words like CEIL_, CELT_, ... but we avoid R,A,N.\n\nWords: CEILS (but that\'s 5 letters? CEILS is not a word? Actually, CEILS is not valid). How about:\n\n- CEDES? But D and S are new. However, E is at position 2? But we had E in position 5 in the first guess, now we put E in position 2? That might be good.\n\nBut note: the feedback for E was dash, meaning E is in the word but not in the fifth position. So if we put E in position 2, that might be the place.\n\nBut we are not sure which position E is in, so we want to test E in a different position? Actually, putting E in position 2 would be testing a new position.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid repeating E? But we must include E because we know it\'s in the word? Actually, no rule says we must include the known letter, but it\'s useful to do so to find the position.\n\nHowever, we can also choose a word without E to rule out other letters? But that might be inefficient because we already know E is present and we have limited guesses. So including E again is better.\n\nWe need to preserve the known information: position 1 is C and E is present.\n\nSo let\'s look for a word that starts with C and has E somewhere else (not position 1 and not position 5) and does not contain R, A, N.\n\nPossible words:\n- With E at position 2: CELTS (this is valid? CELT: a type of stone tool? Plural: CELTS). But wait, CELTS is 5 letters? C-E-L-T-S -> that works. And letters L,T,S are new.\n- Other words: CEILS (not a word), CEDED (past form of cede, 5 letters: but D is repeated? C-E-D-E-D -> wait, that\'s 6 letters? No, CEDED is 5: C-E-D-E-D -> no, that has 5 letters? Positions: [C,E,D,E,D]? Actually, C-E-D-E-D is 5 letters? Word: CEDED has two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has repeated letters.\n\nBut note: our first word was ""crane"" and had unique letters. The secret word might have duplicates? We don\'t know.\n\nBut the feedback: we had only one E marked as dash, which doesn\'t rule out more than one E. But in ""crane"", there was one E. So we don\'t know.\n\nSo let\'s consider CELTS: C-E-L-T-S. This has E at position 2. And letters L,T,S are new and not in the exclusion list (R,A,N).\n\nAlternatively, with E at position 3: \n- Words: CHESS? Has R? No, CHESS: C-H-E-S-S -> E is at position 3. And H,S are new. But S is repeated? Let\'s see: C-H-E-S-S -> that is 5 letters? Yes. The word ""chess"" is 5 letters: positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:S, 5:S? Actually, no: CHESS is spelled C-H-E-S-S? That\'s 5: C, H, E, S (for position 4 and 5? Actually, it\'s C-H-E-S-S? Wait, no: the word CHESS is standardly spelled as C-H-E-S-S? I think that\'s correct: C at 1, H at 2, E at 3, S at 4 and S at 5? That would use two S\'s? But that\'s okay.\n\nBut note: the feedback for E was dash meaning E is present but not in the position we guessed. We guessed E at position 5 and found it\'s not at 5. Now we are putting E at position 3? That might be the correct position or not? We are testing.\n\nBut in CHESS, position 5 would be S? That\'s okay? And H is also a new letter? But what about the feedback? We are avoiding R,A,N so CHESS is okay? But CHESS has two S\'s? How does the feedback handle duplicates? We need to be cautious.\n\nAnother word: CLOSE? But that has O and S? And E at the end? Position: C-L-O-S-E -> E at position 5. We already know E is not at position 5? Because we got dash for E in the first guess meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s wrong? So it\'s a waste.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid putting E at position 5 because we already know it\'s not there.\n\nSo our new guess should have E in positions 2,3, or 4.\n\nBack to words:\n- E at position 3: COPES? C-O-P-E-S -> E at position 4? Actually, position: 1:C, 2:O, 3:P, 4:E, 5:S. That would work. And letters O,P,S are new.\n\nBut we also have: CITED? But T and I are new? But I is a vowel? C-I-T-E-D -> that has E at position 4? And D. But wait, we have the letter T? That\'s new.\n\nBut I got another idea: Since we know E is in the word and not at 1 or 5, let\'s try to cover more common letters.\n\nCommon letters that haven\'t been tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.\n\nSo a good candidate: try ""CLOSE"" but that puts E at 5? Which is bad? Because we know E is not at 5. So let\'s not.\n\nBetter: ""COULD"" -> but that\'s 5 letters? C-O-U-L-D, and E? We are skipping E? It would be better to include E to test its position.\n\nWait, what about ""CELLO""? But CELLO is 5 letters? C-E-L-L-O -> E at position 2? But L repeated? And O? This includes L and O? But we tested E at 2? And we can test L and O? However, if the secret word doesn\'t have two L\'s, we\'ll get feedback accordingly? Okay.\n\nBut let me see: We can also use ""CHEST"" -> C-H-E-S-T: E at position 3? This covers H,E,S,T? Also, no repeated letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""CHESS"" has repeated S? So ""CHEST"" is better: unique letters? But ""ch"" and then ""es"" and ""t""? Yes: C-H-E-S-T.\n\nThat sounds good? Let\'s see: letters: C, H, E, S, T? Avoids R,A,N? Yes.\n\nAnother word: ""CIBED""? Not standard? Or ""CEDIS"" (monetary unit)? But these are less common? It\'s okay? But common words are better.\n\nSo I think ""CHEST"" is a good candidate? Because:\n- Starts with C (fixed)\n- Has E at position 3? This tests E in a new position (position 3)\n- Tests new letters H, S, T\n\nAlternatively, if E might be at position 2? We can test E at position 2 with a word like ""CELTS""? But ""CELTS"" might be less common? But acceptable? Similarly, ""CEILI"" is not a word? So ""CELTS"" is acceptable.\n\nConsidering the feedback, we want to maximize information. Since we don\'t know where E is, if we place it at a position we haven\'t tried? We tried E at 5? So positions 2,3,4 are fresh.\n\nSo either position 2,3, or 4? So both ""CELTS"" and ""CHEST"" are okay? But ""CHEST"" tests E at position 3? We haven\'t tried E in a position in the middle? So it\'s good? Also, ""CHEST"" has more common letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""COWER""? But wait: C-O-W-E-R -> has E and R? But we know R is absent? Because feedback for R was ""x"" meaning not in word? So we cannot use R? Therefore, ""COWER"" is invalid because it has R? Which is eliminated? So we must avoid R? And A and N? Similarly, ""CHEST"": H-E-S-T? No R,A,N? So okay?\n\nBut ""CHEST"": letters: C, H, E, S, T? And position: \n1: C (fixed and known correct? Actually, we already know C is correct at position 1? So we are testing the rest? But regardless, it\'s okay? Because we are required to make a new word? And we are confirming position 1? It is always good? But the feedback for C will be checkmark again? Which we don\'t need? But that\'s how the game works.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with E at position 2: CEASES? no? That has A? But A is excluded? Not allowed? Because we got A with x? So no A. So no word ... how about ""CELLA""? Not common? Or ""CETYL"" too rare? ""CEDED"" has D repeated? But E at position 2? Also ""CEDED"" has E at position 2 and 4? But possibly. However, D is new? Let me check ""CEDED"": C-E-D-E-D? That is 5 letters: positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:D, 4:E, 5:D? So two E\'s and two D\'s? Then the feedback for E? It might be confusing? Because if there are two E\'s? But we don\'t know? So maybe avoid duplicates? For simplicity.\n\nTherefore, ""CHEST"" seems a solid choice? Or ""CHEWY""? But Y? And no E in visible position? ""CHEWY"": E is at position 3? And W,Y? So okay? But ""CHEST"" uses S and T? Which are common? So better?\n\nSimilarly, ""CHOSE"": but that has O? And E at 5? But we cannot put E at 5? So invalid? Because we know E isn\'t at 5? So avoid words that end with E? For now? So ""CHEST"" ends with T? Good.\n\nSo I think I\'ll go with ""CHEST"". But let\'s see the letters? We are introducing H, E, S, T? And we avoid R,A,N? Yes.\n\nWait, but E? We know E is in the word? So we are putting it at position 3? We hope to find feedback on that.\n\nAfter getting feedback on ""CHEST"", we can deduce whether E is at position 3? Or not? If we get a check on E? Then it is? Or dash? Or x? Actually, we know E is in the word? So we cannot get x? Therefore, for E: we\'ll either get ✓ (if at position 3) or - (if it\'s not at 3 but in the word? We know it\'s in the word). But the dash for E in the first guess meant the letter is present but not at that position? Similarly, here? If at position 3? It will be ✓? If not? Then dash? But it cannot be x? Because it\'s in the word? So the feedback for E will be:\n- ✓: if it is at position 3? Then we know? \n- -: if it is present? But then we know it is present anyway? And if it\'s not at position 3? Then it must be at position 2 or 4? Because we already know it isn\'t at 5? And not at 1? Then if we get dash? That tells us nothing new? Except that it\'s not at position 3? But we already know it\'s present? So we learn its position isn\'t 3? Which is information? But we have only one position left? Or two? Position 2,3,4? So if we rule out 3? Then positions 2 and 4? And if position 2? We didn\'t test it? We are testing position 3? So if we get dash? Then we know E must be at 2 or 4? But we haven\'t tested position 2? Will position 2 be tested? In this word? We are not testing position 2? Position 2 is H? So if E were at position2? Then for ""CHEST"" the E at position3 would be not present? But E is present? What? Wait? Actually? There can only be one E? Or two? We don\'t know? So if E is at position2? Then for ""CHEST"":\n- The E at position3? That\'s not in the secret word? So that\'s x? But wait? How does the game handle duplicates? \n\nOh? Important: if the secret word has one E? And we guess a word with two E\'s? Then? The game\'s feedback only considers duplicate letters? Based on the secret word\'s count. In Wordle? If a letter appears one time? Then only one E is given feedback? So? Suppose the secret word has one E? Then our guess of ""teste"" might have? \n\nBut in our case? Our first word was ""crane"" with one E? The secret word must have at least one E? But not at position5? Now? Our guess ""CHEST"" has one E? At position3? So if the secret word has E at position3? Then we get ✓? If the secret word has E at position2? Then we will get: \n- Position 3 E: not found? So an x? Because the secret word has only one E? Already highlighted elsewhere? Or? Actually? The rules: the feedback indicates for each letter if it is in the word? But? Only once? \n\nClarification? How many E\'s? We don\'t know? So we have to be cautious? The feedback for ""CHEST"" if E is at position2? Then:\n- C: check? Because position1 is C? \n- H: if the secret word doesn\'t have H? Then x? \n- E: at position3? The secret word has an E? But at position2? So? Then the E at position3? Since it\'s not matching? And the secret word has only one E? Then the E in our guess would be marked? Position3: x? Because the E is already recognized at? Wait? But the positions? \n\nActually? The feedback:\n- The secret word has E? Then a dash for E? If it appears elsewhere? So? For ""CHEST"": \n  If E is at position2? Then:\n    Position1: C -> ✓? \n    Position2: H -> but the secret word has E? So H at position2? Might be not E? So x? \n    Position3: E -> but the secret word has E at position2? Only? Then E at position3? Is not matching? Since E is already covered by the one at position2? So we get x? \n\nBut let me check an example? Suppose secret word: CREEP? Not applicable? Because we only have one E? \n\nBut we need to understand? The rules: if the letter is present? And not matched? Then dash? But in the first guess? We had E at position5? But E is present? But not at5? So dash? Then? Similarly? For E? It gets a dash per occurrence? If there are duplicates? \n\nBut for simplicity? Since we don\'t know if there is more than one E? Then? In ""CHEST"": \n- If E is at position2? Then for our E at position3? We might get dash if there are two E\'s? Or x if only one E? Because the E was already counted at position2? \n\nI think? The game marks both as follows? \n- First? Find exact matches? So position? Then? From left? Any letter not matched? But in the word? Gets a dash? And any letter not in word? Gets x? \n\nSo? If the secret word has one E? Then?\nGuess1: E? Not exact? But E is present? So dash? Then?\nGuess2: E again? If placed correctly? Check? Otherwise? Dash or x? \n\nWait? But if the secret word has one E? And we guess two E\'s? Then? If one E is exactly at the right position? Then the other? E? That isn\'t? Will be marked x? Because? When parsing? The exact matched E is counted? Then? The other E? In our guess? Is not in the word? Because? The secret word has only one E? Which was already matched? So? The other E gets x? \n\nBut if the secret word has two E\'s? Then? Both E\'s? Could be matches or dashes? \n\nGiven? We only knew? E is somewhere? So we don\'t know the count? \n\nBut in CHEST? Only one E? So? In secret word? If E is at position2? Then? \nOur guess: \n- Position1: C? Correct? \n- Position2: H? Is it E? Or something else? \n- Position3: E? \nThe secret? Position1: C? Position2: E? Position3: something? \nSo? \n- Position1: C? Matches? So ✓? \n- Position2: H? Secret has E at2? So? E is not H? But H is not E? And H? So? Is H in the word? Not E? But? The secret word at position2 is E? So? Letter H? It may or may not be in the word? Maybe not? \n\nActually? For position2: H? \nIf H is not in the secret word? Then x? \nAnd position3: E? The secret has E but at position2? So? E at position3? The secret has E at position2? But? Position3 is not E? So? The E? In guess position3? Is not matching? And? Because? There\'s only one E? Which was already used? So? We get x? Or dash? \n\nThis becomes complex? \n\nAlternatively? We can avoid duplicates to reduce complexity? Therefore? Choose a word with E only once? And in a previously uncovered position? \n\nBut I think? It\'s safer to choose a word that puts E in a position where we have not tried? And doesn\'t introduce duplicates? \n\nSo? Back to? ""CLOSE"" puts E at5? Which is bad? So avoid? \n\nWord ""CHEAP""? But has A? Which is excluded? Because A was x? So no? \n\n""CHEST"" is good? \n- Doesn\'t have A? Doesn\'t have R? Doesn\'t have N? \n- Has E at position3? \n- New letters: H, S, T? \n\nTherefore? Let\'s guess ""CHEST""? \n\nBut wait? What about ""CEDED""? I think? Let\'s check? \n\nBetter? Use? ""CELLO"": \nC E L L O? E at position2? And L? But two L\'s? So? That might be confusing? \n\nAlternatively? ""CETUS?"" not common? \n\nSo? ""CHEST"" it is? Or ""CHUTE""? \n""CHUTE"": C-H-U-T-E? But E at5? Which we know it\'s not? So avoid? \n\nTherefore? I\'ll go with? ""CHEST""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""cra ne"":\n- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all (x).\n- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (-).\n\nThis means:\n1.

Based on the accumulated feedback:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R, A, N are not in the word (x).
- E is present but not in position 5 (-), so E is in the secret word at positions 2, 3, or 4.

From Guess 2 (""chest""):
- C is still correct and in position 1 (✓). This is consistent and reinforces position 1 is fixed.
- H is not in the word (x). So H cannot be used.
- E is still present but not in position 3 (since we got - for position 3 in this guess). This means E is not at position 3, and combined with Guess 1, E is not at position 5 either. So E must be at position 2 or 4.
- S and T are not in the word (x). Both are eliminated.

Summary of constraints:
- Position 1: C (fixed, known letter).
- Position 2: Must be E? Or could be something else? We know E is at position 2 or 4.
- Letters excluded: R, A, N, H, S, T.
- E is in the word at position 2 or 4 only (since position 3 and 5 are ruled out).
- Possible positions for E: 2 and 4 remain.

Deductions:
- We have tried positions 1, 3, and 5 for non-E letters that were eliminated (except position 2 which hasn't been tested with E).
- Position 2: Was H in second guess, which is eliminated. But we have E that must be at position 2 or 4.

Now, for the next guess:
- We must include E since it is known to be present.
- Place E at position 2 or position 4 to test which one is correct.
- Position 1 remains C.
- We need to fill the other positions with entirely new letters that haven't been tested and are not excluded.
- Excluded letters: R, A, N, H, S, T.

Available letters: All English letters except those excluded: so avoid R, A, N, H, S, T.

Letters used so far: C, R, A, N, E, H, S, T → So letters still available: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
But we need common ones.

Our goal: Determine if E is at position 2 or position 4.

Strategy:
Option 1: Place E at position 2 in this guess. If we get ✓ for position 2, then we know E is at 2. If we get -, that would imply E is not at position 2 (and must be at position 4). But note: if we place E at position 2 and get -, that would be inconsistent because if E is present, position 2 is a possible location, and if it's there, we get ✓. If it's not there and we placed it, we get -? But we know E is either at position 2 or position 4. If we put E at position 2 and get ✓, it's correct. If we get -, it means E is not at position 2, so it must be at position 4.

Option 2: Place E at position 4. If ✓, it's at 4. If -, it could be elsewhere? But we know E is either at position 2 or 4, so if not at 4, must be at 2.

But we also need to test other letters to fill the word.

Since we have limited guesses, we should prioritize identifying E's position while testing new letters.

Also, position 3 and 5 are unknown and need filling.

Choose a word that:
- Starts with C.
- Places E at either position 2 or position 4.
- Uses new common letters not excluded.

First, try to place E at position 2.

Possible words starting with CE.

But avoid excluded letters R,A,N,H,S,T.

So CE followed by 3 letters from available pool.

Common words:
- CEDED? Not eligible because D repeated? But let's find valid words.
- CELLO? But L and O? But CELLO has L (available) and O (available). But CELLO: C-E-L-L-O. Positions 3 and 4 are L and L? Position 5 O.
But CELLO has two L's? And E at position 2.
But E is at position 2? And L and O are new? Avoids R,A,N,H,S,T? Yes.

Another word: CABLE? But contains A? A is excluded, so no.

CEMENT? But 6 letters? Too long? No, we need 5-letter word.

CEILI? Not a word.

Reasonable words: CEIBO? Not common? CELOM? Not English?

Better go with common words.

CUBED? But U,B,E,D? E is supposed to be at position 2? But CUBED is C-U-B-E-D, so E is at position 4? Not 2.

For position 2: CE___ words.

Examples: CEDED (C-E-D-E-D, so E at 2 and 4? But we have E at 2 only? Unless forced).

CELTS? But S is excluded? From guess 2, S is x? So not in word? So cannot use S.

CELTS has S? Excluded? No.

CELTS: C-E-L-T-S, but T and S both excluded? T is x in guess 2? So cannot use T either? Yes, T is excluded, S excluded.

Therefore, cannot use S or T.

Available letters: must not include R, A, N, H, S, T.

So possibilities for CE words: must fill positions 3,4,5 with 3 letters from B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? How about CELLA? Rare? Not words.

CEORL? Not common.

Perhaps CEIBA or not? Limited.

Option to place E at position 4.

Then the word would be C__E_?

Position 1: C, position 4: E.

Must fill positions 2,3,5 with available letters? And not excluded.

Common words: like CAMEO? But A excluded? CAME O? A is excluded? No.

Other: CAPER? But A and R excluded? No.

Cable? A excluded.

COWED? But O,W,E,D? And E at position 4? But COWED: C-O-W-E-D? Position 4 is E? But D is available? O? W? 

COWED is valid? Meaning forced submission? Yes.

But E at position 4? And positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:D? Avoids excluded letters? O, W, D not excluded? And E is placed? So yes.

Another word: COPED? C-O-P-E-D? E at position 4? Similar? O,P,D available? Yes.

CUBED? C-U-B-E-D? E at position 4? U,B,D available? Yes.

Now, among these, we also want to test common letters.

But what about position 3 and 5? They are open.

Given that we are placing E at position 4? Which is one of the possible locations? Then? If we get ✓ for E, great? If not? Then it must be at position 2? So we learn either way? 

Moreover, in this guess, we also test letters in positions 2 and 3.

So? For example, if we guess ""COWED"":
- If E is not at position 4, we get - for E? But if E is at position 4? We get ✓? Also positions 2 and 3 are O and W? Which might be present or not? 

Similarly? Other letters? 

But we have position 5? Must fill.

Since position 1 is fixed? Position 4 could be E or not? We are testing.

But we know E is either at position 2 or position 4? So if we place E at position 4? And get dash? Then E must be at position 2? Because those are the only possibilities? So we learn E's position from this feedback? Either ✓ or - -> if ✓? Position 4? If -? Then position 4 not? Then must be position 2? So yes? We can determine? 

Moreover, we test three new letters? In positions 2,3,5.

For example? ""CUBED""?: C U B E D? Positions: 1: C? Fixed? ✓ always? 2: U? May be? Not excluded? 3: B? New? 4: E? Position we test? 5: D? New.

Similarly? ""COPED""? C O P E D? Similar? Common letters? ""COWED"" also.

To choose: select one that has common letters? B,P,D,O,U? Etc.

""COPED"" seems good? Because O and P are common.

Another candidate: ""COVED""? C O V E D? Also possible? But V is less common.

Or ""CAGED""? But A excluded? No.

""CLIMB""? But no E? We must include E? Because we know E is present? But if we omit E? We don't test E's position? That would be bad? Because we want to confirm where E is? 

So words without E at position 2 or 4 won't help? So we should avoid.

Therefore: ""COPED"" or ""CUBED"" or ""COWED""? 

Let me see: we also have letters to test? But since E is placed at position4? And if it works? Then position4 is solved? If not? Then we know position2 must be E? 

But in position2? Currently we have in COPED: O? Which is new? 

Perhaps choose a word that places E at position2? But earlier we had difficulty finding words with E at position2 without excluded letters? 

For position2 E? Words like CE: C E _ _ _?

With filled from available letters? Must use letters not excluded and not used? 

Possible words: CEDED? C-E-D-E-D? But D repeated? And E repeated? 

But available letters? It's a valid word? But messy? 

Other: CEZED? Not a word? CELOM? Not? 

Better? CEIBO? Not? 

Cella: CELLO? Earlier? But position3 and4: L L? Position5: O? But L repeated? CELLO is 5 letters? C-E-L-L-O? How common is it?

But L and O available? No excluded? 

So ""CELLO"": C E L L O? E at position2? Then if feedback: 
- Position1: C ✓
- Position2: E ? Either ✓ or -? But we know E must be at position2 or4? If E is at position2, we get ✓? If not? Then we get -? Which means E is at position4? Then we know? 

Also, L at position3 and position4? O position5? L and O are common? 

But there's a duplicate L? Which might complicate? But if L is in the word? We get feedback accordingly? 

So ""CELLO"" is an option? 

Comparing to placing E at position4? 

To decide? ""CELLO"" with E at position2? Vs ""COPED"" with E at position4? 

Each tests a different position for E? And introduces three new letters? 

Since time is limited? And ""COPED"" seems simpler? Because no duplicates? Yes? 

Therefore? Let's use ""COPED""? 

""CUBED"" also? 

Both are valid? 

Let me choose ""COPED"" as it uses O and P? Which are high frequency? 

So guess: ""COPED"" 

This guess: C O P E D? 

If E is at position4? Feedback: 
- Position4: E✓? Then we know E is at4? 
- Position4: E-? Then E must be at position2? 

And we get feedback on O, P, D? 

Even if it's dash? We learn something? 

Similarly? 

So? Final decision: Guess ""COPED"" 

But let's verify excluded: R,A,N,H,S,T are excluded? COPED has C,O,P,E,D? No excluded? Yes? 

Word is valid? Yes? Copied? Past tense of cope? 

So? 

<guess>coped</guess> 

Thought below? 

In summary? After two guesses? We know: 
- Word starts with C? 
- E present at position2 or4? 
- Excluded: R,A,N,H,S,T? 

Third guess: ""COPED"" places E at position4? To test? And uses O at position2? P at position3? D at position5? All new letters? 

This will give clear feedback on E?s position? And also on O,P,D?

Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(✓), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  Insights:  
  - Position 1 is fixed as ""C"".  
  - Letters ""R"", ""A"", and ""N"" are excluded (not in the word).  
  - ""E"" is in the word but not in position 5 (must be in position 2, 3, or 4).  

- **Guess 2: ""chest""**  
  Feedback: C(✓), H(x), E(-), S(x), T(x)  
  Insights:  
  - Position 1 is ""C"" (confirmed again).  
  - ""H"", ""S"", and ""T"" are excluded (not in the word).  
  - ""E"" is not in position 3 (because it returned ""-""), so it must be in position 2 or 4 (since position 5 is already ruled out from Guess 1).  

**Summary of known information:**  
- Position 1 is ""C"".  
- ""E"" must be in position 2 or 4.  
- Excluded letters (not in the word): R, A, N, H, S, T.  
- Letters not yet tested: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

**Strategy for this guess:**  
We need to determine if ""E"" is in position 2 or position 4. To do this efficiently, place ""E"" in position 4 to test this possibility:  
- If the feedback shows ""E"" as ✓ in position 4, it is correct.  
- If ""E"" is -, it means ""E"" is in position 2 (the only other option).  
Additionally, fill the other positions with common, untested letters to gain more information:  
- Position 2: Use a new vowel/consonant (e.g., ""O"").  
- Position 3: Use a common consonant (e.g., ""P"").  
- Position 5: Use a common consonant (e.g., ""D"").  
The word **""COPED""** fits well:  
- Starts with ""C"" (position 1 fixed).  
- Places ""E"" in position 4 (to test the position).  
- Uses new letters ""O"", ""P"", and ""D"" (all untested and not excluded).  
- Avoids duplicates and excluded letters.  

After this guess, the feedback will clarify:  
- If ""E"" is ✓ at position 4, it is solved.  
- If ""E"" is -, ""E"" must be at position 2.  
- Feedback for ""O"", ""P"", and ""D"" will reveal if they are in the word and their positions.

But E at position 4? And positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:D? Avoids excluded letters? O, W, D not excluded? And E is placed? So yes.

Another word: COPED? C-O-P-E-D? E at position 4? Similar? O,P,D available? Yes.

CUBED? C-U-B-E-D? E at position 4? U,B,D available? Yes.

Now, among these, we also want to test common letters.

But what about position 3 and 5? They are open.

Given that we are placing E at position 4? Which is one of the possible locations? Then? If we get ✓ for E, great? If not? Then it must be at position 2? So we learn either way? 

Moreover, in this guess, we also test letters in positions 2 and 3.

So? For example, if we guess ""COWED"":
- If E is not at position 4, we get - for E? But if E is at position 4? We get ✓? Also positions 2 and 3 are O and W? Which might be present or not? 

Similarly? Other letters? 

But we have position 5? Must fill.

Since position 1 is fixed? Position 4 could be E or not? We are testing.

But we know E is either at position 2 or position 4? So if we place E at position 4? And get dash? Then E must be at position 2? Because those are the only possibilities? So we learn E's position from this feedback? Either ✓ or - -> if ✓? Position 4? If -? Then position 4 not? Then must be position 2? So yes? We can determine? 

Moreover, we test three new letters? In positions 2,3,5.

For example? ""CUBED""?: C U B E D? Positions: 1: C? Fixed? ✓ always? 2: U? May be? Not excluded? 3: B? New? 4: E? Position we test? 5: D? New.

Similarly? ""COPED""? C O P E D? Similar? Common letters? ""COWED"" also.

To choose: select one that has common letters? B,P,D,O,U? Etc.

""COPED"" seems good? Because O and P are common.

Another candidate: ""COVED""? C O V E D? Also possible? But V is less common.

Or ""CAGED""? But A excluded? No.

""CLIMB""? But no E? We must include E? Because we know E is present? But if we omit E? We don't test E's position? That would be bad? Because we want to confirm where E is? 

So words without E at position 2 or 4 won't help? So we should avoid.

Therefore: ""COPED"" or ""CUBED"" or ""COWED""? 

Let me see: we also have letters to test? But since E is placed at position4? And if it works? Then position4 is solved? If not? Then we know position2 must be E? 

But in position2? Currently we have in COPED: O? Which is new? 

Perhaps choose a word that places E at position2? But earlier we had difficulty finding words with E at position2 without excluded letters? 

For position2 E? Words like CE: C E _ _ _?

With filled from available letters? Must use letters not excluded and not used? 

Possible words: CEDED? C-E-D-E-D? But D repeated? And E repeated? 

But available letters? It's a valid word? But messy? 

Other: CEZED? Not a word? CELOM? Not? 

Better? CEIBO? Not? 

Cella: CELLO? Earlier? But position3 and4: L L? Position5: O? But L repeated? CELLO is 5 letters? C-E-L-L-O? How common is it?

But L and O available? No excluded? 

So ""CELLO"": C E L L O? E at position2? Then if feedback: 
- Position1: C ✓
- Position2: E ? Either ✓ or -? But we know E must be at position2 or4? If E is at position2, we get ✓? If not? Then we get -? Which means E is at position4? Then we know? 

Also, L at position3 and position4? O position5? L and O are common? 

But there's a duplicate L? Which might complicate? But if L is in the word? We get feedback accordingly? 

So ""CELLO"" is an option? 

Comparing to placing E at position4? 

To decide? ""CELLO"" with E at position2? Vs ""COPED"" with E at position4? 

Each tests a different position for E? And introduces three new letters? 

Since time is limited? And ""COPED"" seems simpler? Because no duplicates? Yes? 

Therefore? Let's use ""COPED""? 

""CUBED"" also? 

Both are valid? 

Let me choose ""COPED"" as it uses O and P? Which are high frequency? 

So guess: ""COPED"" 

This guess: C O P E D? 

If E is at position4? Feedback: 
- Position4: E✓? Then we know E is at4? 
- Position4: E-? Then E must be at position2? 

And we get feedback on O, P, D? 

Even if it's dash? We learn something? 

Similarly? 

So? Final decision: Guess ""COPED"" 

But let's verify excluded: R,A,N,H,S,T are excluded? COPED has C,O,P,E,D? No excluded? Yes? 

Word is valid? Yes? Copied? Past tense of cope? 

So? 

<guess>coped</guess> 

Thought below? 

In summary? After two guesses? We know: 
- Word starts with C? 
- E present at position2 or4? 
- Excluded: R,A,N,H,S,T? 

Third guess: ""COPED"" places E at position4? To test? And uses O at position2? P at position3? D at position5? All new letters? 

This will give clear feedback on E?s position? And also on O,P,D?Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(✓), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  Insights:  
  - Position 1 is fixed as ""C"".  
  - Letters ""R"", ""A"", and ""N"" are excluded (not in the word).  
  - ""E"" is in the word but not in position 5 (must be in position 2, 3, or 4).  

- **Guess 2: ""chest""**  
  Feedback: C(✓), H(x), E(-), S(x), T(x)  
  Insights:  
  - Position 1 is ""C"" (confirmed again).  
  - ""H"", ""S"", and ""T"" are excluded (not in the word).  
  - ""E"" is not in position 3 (because it returned ""-""), so it must be in position 2 or 4 (since position 5 is already ruled out from Guess 1).  

**Summary of known information:**  
- Position 1 is ""C"".  
- ""E"" must be in position 2 or 4.  
- Excluded letters (not in the word): R, A, N, H, S, T.  
- Letters not yet tested: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

**Strategy for this guess:**  
We need to determine if ""E"" is in position 2 or position 4. To do this efficiently, place ""E"" in position 4 to test this possibility:  
- If the feedback shows ""E"" as ✓ in position 4, it is correct.  
- If ""E"" is -, it means ""E"" is in position 2 (the only other option).  
Additionally, fill the other positions with common, untested letters to gain more information:  
- Position 2: Use a new vowel/consonant (e.g., ""O"").  
- Position 3: Use a common consonant (e.g., ""P"").  
- Position 5: Use a common consonant (e.g., ""D"").  
The word **""COPED""** fits well:  
- Starts with ""C"" (position 1 fixed).  
- Places ""E"" in position 4 (to test the position).  
- Uses new letters ""O"", ""P"", and ""D"" (all untested and not excluded).  
- Avoids duplicates and excluded letters.  

After this guess, the feedback will clarify:  
- If ""E"" is ✓ at position 4, it is solved.  
- If ""E"" is -, ""E"" must be at position 2.  
- Feedback for ""O"", ""P"", and ""D"" will reveal if they are in the word and their positions.",Guess 3: coped -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(-) P(x) E(-) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,cello,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and positions.
 A good starting word often has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. 
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E).
   - It covers letters that frequently appear in 5-letter words.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Interpretation:
- The letter C is in the secret word and is in the first position (since we got a checkmark).
- The letter R is not in the secret word at all (x).
- The letter A is not in the secret word at all (x).
- The letter N is not in the secret word at all (x).
- The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the fifth position (since we put E at the end and got a dash).

Important deductions:
1. The secret word starts with C (because C is correct and in position 1).
2. The secret word contains the letter E, but not at the end (position 5). So E must be in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4.
3. The letters R, A, and N are completely absent from the secret word.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Position 1: C
- Contains E (but not at position 5, and not at position 1 obviously) so in 2,3, or 4.
- Does not contain R, A, or N.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Starts with C (since position 1 is fixed).
- Does not include R, A, or N (these are out).
- Includes E (but not at position 5) and we are to try to place E in a position we haven't tried (so positions 2,3, or 4).
- We also want to test other common letters that haven't been tried yet to get more information.

Available letters: We know R, A, N are out. We have already used C and E. So we should avoid those and also avoid R,A,N.

But note: We must include E somewhere? Actually, we don't have to force it in the second guess because we already know E is in the word, but we are trying to find its position. However, including E again in a different position can help. But consider that we are limited to 5 letters and we cannot use R,A,N.

We also note that we don't know letters in positions 2,3,4,5. We only know position 1 is C and that E is present but not in the same position as before.

Good strategy: Try a word that starts with C and has E in one of the positions 2,3,4, and adds three new letters that are common and haven't been tried.

Previously we used: C, R, A, N, E. So avoid R,A,N and use new letters.

Common letters left: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

Let's think of words starting with C and having E in position 2,3, or 4.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 2: then the word would be C E _ _ _
- Position 3: then C _ E _ _
- Position 4: then C _ _ E _

We also know that E cannot be at position 5 (from the first feedback).

Let's brainstorm some words:

Option 1: E in position 2 -> words like CEIL_, CELT_, ... but we avoid R,A,N.

Words: CEILS (but that's 5 letters? CEILS is not a word? Actually, CEILS is not valid). How about:

- CEDES? But D and S are new. However, E is at position 2? But we had E in position 5 in the first guess, now we put E in position 2? That might be good.

But note: the feedback for E was dash, meaning E is in the word but not in the fifth position. So if we put E in position 2, that might be the place.

But we are not sure which position E is in, so we want to test E in a different position? Actually, putting E in position 2 would be testing a new position.

Alternatively, we can avoid repeating E? But we must include E because we know it's in the word? Actually, no rule says we must include the known letter, but it's useful to do so to find the position.

However, we can also choose a word without E to rule out other letters? But that might be inefficient because we already know E is present and we have limited guesses. So including E again is better.

We need to preserve the known information: position 1 is C and E is present.

So let's look for a word that starts with C and has E somewhere else (not position 1 and not position 5) and does not contain R, A, N.

Possible words:
- With E at position 2: CELTS (this is valid? CELT: a type of stone tool? Plural: CELTS). But wait, CELTS is 5 letters? C-E-L-T-S -> that works. And letters L,T,S are new.
- Other words: CEILS (not a word), CEDED (past form of cede, 5 letters: but D is repeated? C-E-D-E-D -> wait, that's 6 letters? No, CEDED is 5: C-E-D-E-D -> no, that has 5 letters? Positions: [C,E,D,E,D]? Actually, C-E-D-E-D is 5 letters? Word: CEDED has two E's? We don't know if the word has repeated letters.

But note: our first word was ""crane"" and had unique letters. The secret word might have duplicates? We don't know.

But the feedback: we had only one E marked as dash, which doesn't rule out more than one E. But in ""crane"", there was one E. So we don't know.

So let's consider CELTS: C-E-L-T-S. This has E at position 2. And letters L,T,S are new and not in the exclusion list (R,A,N).

Alternatively, with E at position 3: 
- Words: CHESS? Has R? No, CHESS: C-H-E-S-S -> E is at position 3. And H,S are new. But S is repeated? Let's see: C-H-E-S-S -> that is 5 letters? Yes. The word ""chess"" is 5 letters: positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:S, 5:S? Actually, no: CHESS is spelled C-H-E-S-S? That's 5: C, H, E, S (for position 4 and 5? Actually, it's C-H-E-S-S? Wait, no: the word CHESS is standardly spelled as C-H-E-S-S? I think that's correct: C at 1, H at 2, E at 3, S at 4 and S at 5? That would use two S's? But that's okay.

But note: the feedback for E was dash meaning E is present but not in the position we guessed. We guessed E at position 5 and found it's not at 5. Now we are putting E at position 3? That might be the correct position or not? We are testing.

But in CHESS, position 5 would be S? That's okay? And H is also a new letter? But what about the feedback? We are avoiding R,A,N so CHESS is okay? But CHESS has two S's? How does the feedback handle duplicates? We need to be cautious.

Another word: CLOSE? But that has O and S? And E at the end? Position: C-L-O-S-E -> E at position 5. We already know E is not at position 5? Because we got dash for E in the first guess meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's wrong? So it's a waste.

Therefore, we should avoid putting E at position 5 because we already know it's not there.

So our new guess should have E in positions 2,3, or 4.

Back to words:
- E at position 3: COPES? C-O-P-E-S -> E at position 4? Actually, position: 1:C, 2:O, 3:P, 4:E, 5:S. That would work. And letters O,P,S are new.

But we also have: CITED? But T and I are new? But I is a vowel? C-I-T-E-D -> that has E at position 4? And D. But wait, we have the letter T? That's new.

But I got another idea: Since we know E is in the word and not at 1 or 5, let's try to cover more common letters.

Common letters that haven't been tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

So a good candidate: try ""CLOSE"" but that puts E at 5? Which is bad? Because we know E is not at 5. So let's not.

Better: ""COULD"" -> but that's 5 letters? C-O-U-L-D, and E? We are skipping E? It would be better to include E to test its position.

Wait, what about ""CELLO""? But CELLO is 5 letters? C-E-L-L-O -> E at position 2? But L repeated? And O? This includes L and O? But we tested E at 2? And we can test L and O? However, if the secret word doesn't have two L's, we'll get feedback accordingly? Okay.

But let me see: We can also use ""CHEST"" -> C-H-E-S-T: E at position 3? This covers H,E,S,T? Also, no repeated letters.

Similarly, ""CHESS"" has repeated S? So ""CHEST"" is better: unique letters? But ""ch"" and then ""es"" and ""t""? Yes: C-H-E-S-T.

That sounds good? Let's see: letters: C, H, E, S, T? Avoids R,A,N? Yes.

Another word: ""CIBED""? Not standard? Or ""CEDIS"" (monetary unit)? But these are less common? It's okay? But common words are better.

So I think ""CHEST"" is a good candidate? Because:
- Starts with C (fixed)
- Has E at position 3? This tests E in a new position (position 3)
- Tests new letters H, S, T

Alternatively, if E might be at position 2? We can test E at position 2 with a word like ""CELTS""? But ""CELTS"" might be less common? But acceptable? Similarly, ""CEILI"" is not a word? So ""CELTS"" is acceptable.

Considering the feedback, we want to maximize information. Since we don't know where E is, if we place it at a position we haven't tried? We tried E at 5? So positions 2,3,4 are fresh.

So either position 2,3, or 4? So both ""CELTS"" and ""CHEST"" are okay? But ""CHEST"" tests E at position 3? We haven't tried E in a position in the middle? So it's good? Also, ""CHEST"" has more common letters.

Another candidate: ""COWER""? But wait: C-O-W-E-R -> has E and R? But we know R is absent? Because feedback for R was ""x"" meaning not in word? So we cannot use R? Therefore, ""COWER"" is invalid because it has R? Which is eliminated? So we must avoid R? And A and N? Similarly, ""CHEST"": H-E-S-T? No R,A,N? So okay?

But ""CHEST"": letters: C, H, E, S, T? And position: 
1: C (fixed and known correct? Actually, we already know C is correct at position 1? So we are testing the rest? But regardless, it's okay? Because we are required to make a new word? And we are confirming position 1? It is always good? But the feedback for C will be checkmark again? Which we don't need? But that's how the game works.

Alternatively, we can try a word with E at position 2: CEASES? no? That has A? But A is excluded? Not allowed? Because we got A with x? So no A. So no word ... how about ""CELLA""? Not common? Or ""CETYL"" too rare? ""CEDED"" has D repeated? But E at position 2? Also ""CEDED"" has E at position 2 and 4? But possibly. However, D is new? Let me check ""CEDED"": C-E-D-E-D? That is 5 letters: positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:D, 4:E, 5:D? So two E's and two D's? Then the feedback for E? It might be confusing? Because if there are two E's? But we don't know? So maybe avoid duplicates? For simplicity.

Therefore, ""CHEST"" seems a solid choice? Or ""CHEWY""? But Y? And no E in visible position? ""CHEWY"": E is at position 3? And W,Y? So okay? But ""CHEST"" uses S and T? Which are common? So better?

Similarly, ""CHOSE"": but that has O? And E at 5? But we cannot put E at 5? So invalid? Because we know E isn't at 5? So avoid words that end with E? For now? So ""CHEST"" ends with T? Good.

So I think I'll go with ""CHEST"". But let's see the letters? We are introducing H, E, S, T? And we avoid R,A,N? Yes.

Wait, but E? We know E is in the word? So we are putting it at position 3? We hope to find feedback on that.

After getting feedback on ""CHEST"", we can deduce whether E is at position 3? Or not? If we get a check on E? Then it is? Or dash? Or x? Actually, we know E is in the word? So we cannot get x? Therefore, for E: we'll either get ✓ (if at position 3) or - (if it's not at 3 but in the word? We know it's in the word). But the dash for E in the first guess meant the letter is present but not at that position? Similarly, here? If at position 3? It will be ✓? If not? Then dash? But it cannot be x? Because it's in the word? So the feedback for E will be:
- ✓: if it is at position 3? Then we know? 
- -: if it is present? But then we know it is present anyway? And if it's not at position 3? Then it must be at position 2 or 4? Because we already know it isn't at 5? And not at 1? Then if we get dash? That tells us nothing new? Except that it's not at position 3? But we already know it's present? So we learn its position isn't 3? Which is information? But we have only one position left? Or two? Position 2,3,4? So if we rule out 3? Then positions 2 and 4? And if position 2? We didn't test it? We are testing position 3? So if we get dash? Then we know E must be at 2 or 4? But we haven't tested position 2? Will position 2 be tested? In this word? We are not testing position 2? Position 2 is H? So if E were at position2? Then for ""CHEST"" the E at position3 would be not present? But E is present? What? Wait? Actually? There can only be one E? Or two? We don't know? So if E is at position2? Then for ""CHEST"":
- The E at position3? That's not in the secret word? So that's x? But wait? How does the game handle duplicates? 

Oh? Important: if the secret word has one E? And we guess a word with two E's? Then? The game's feedback only considers duplicate letters? Based on the secret word's count. In Wordle? If a letter appears one time? Then only one E is given feedback? So? Suppose the secret word has one E? Then our guess of ""teste"" might have? 

But in our case? Our first word was ""crane"" with one E? The secret word must have at least one E? But not at position5? Now? Our guess ""CHEST"" has one E? At position3? So if the secret word has E at position3? Then we get ✓? If the secret word has E at position2? Then we will get: 
- Position 3 E: not found? So an x? Because the secret word has only one E? Already highlighted elsewhere? Or? Actually? The rules: the feedback indicates for each letter if it is in the word? But? Only once? 

Clarification? How many E's? We don't know? So we have to be cautious? The feedback for ""CHEST"" if E is at position2? Then:
- C: check? Because position1 is C? 
- H: if the secret word doesn't have H? Then x? 
- E: at position3? The secret word has an E? But at position2? So? Then the E at position3? Since it's not matching? And the secret word has only one E? Then the E in our guess would be marked? Position3: x? Because the E is already recognized at? Wait? But the positions? 

Actually? The feedback:
- The secret word has E? Then a dash for E? If it appears elsewhere? So? For ""CHEST"": 
  If E is at position2? Then:
    Position1: C -> ✓? 
    Position2: H -> but the secret word has E? So H at position2? Might be not E? So x? 
    Position3: E -> but the secret word has E at position2? Only? Then E at position3? Is not matching? Since E is already covered by the one at position2? So we get x? 

But let me check an example? Suppose secret word: CREEP? Not applicable? Because we only have one E? 

But we need to understand? The rules: if the letter is present? And not matched? Then dash? But in the first guess? We had E at position5? But E is present? But not at5? So dash? Then? Similarly? For E? It gets a dash per occurrence? If there are duplicates? 

But for simplicity? Since we don't know if there is more than one E? Then? In ""CHEST"": 
- If E is at position2? Then for our E at position3? We might get dash if there are two E's? Or x if only one E? Because the E was already counted at position2? 

I think? The game marks both as follows? 
- First? Find exact matches? So position? Then? From left? Any letter not matched? But in the word? Gets a dash? And any letter not in word? Gets x? 

So? If the secret word has one E? Then?
Guess1: E? Not exact? But E is present? So dash? Then?
Guess2: E again? If placed correctly? Check? Otherwise? Dash or x? 

Wait? But if the secret word has one E? And we guess two E's? Then? If one E is exactly at the right position? Then the other? E? That isn't? Will be marked x? Because? When parsing? The exact matched E is counted? Then? The other E? In our guess? Is not in the word? Because? The secret word has only one E? Which was already matched? So? The other E gets x? 

But if the secret word has two E's? Then? Both E's? Could be matches or dashes? 

Given? We only knew? E is somewhere? So we don't know the count? 

But in CHEST? Only one E? So? In secret word? If E is at position2? Then? 
Our guess: 
- Position1: C? Correct? 
- Position2: H? Is it E? Or something else? 
- Position3: E? 
The secret? Position1: C? Position2: E? Position3: something? 
So? 
- Position1: C? Matches? So ✓? 
- Position2: H? Secret has E at2? So? E is not H? But H is not E? And H? So? Is H in the word? Not E? But? The secret word at position2 is E? So? Letter H? It may or may not be in the word? Maybe not? 

Actually? For position2: H? 
If H is not in the secret word? Then x? 
And position3: E? The secret has E but at position2? So? E at position3? The secret has E at position2? But? Position3 is not E? So? The E? In guess position3? Is not matching? And? Because? There's only one E? Which was already used? So? We get x? Or dash? 

This becomes complex? 

Alternatively? We can avoid duplicates to reduce complexity? Therefore? Choose a word with E only once? And in a previously uncovered position? 

But I think? It's safer to choose a word that puts E in a position where we have not tried? And doesn't introduce duplicates? 

So? Back to? ""CLOSE"" puts E at5? Which is bad? So avoid? 

Word ""CHEAP""? But has A? Which is excluded? Because A was x? So no? 

""CHEST"" is good? 
- Doesn't have A? Doesn't have R? Doesn't have N? 
- Has E at position3? 
- New letters: H, S, T? 

Therefore? Let's guess ""CHEST""? 

But wait? What about ""CEDED""? I think? Let's check? 

Better? Use? ""CELLO"": 
C E L L O? E at position2? And L? But two L's? So? That might be confusing? 

Alternatively? ""CETUS?"" not common? 

So? ""CHEST"" it is? Or ""CHUTE""? 
""CHUTE"": C-H-U-T-E? But E at5? Which we know it's not? So avoid? 

Therefore? I'll go with? ""CHEST""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""cra ne"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all (x).
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (-).

This means:
1. The secret word starts with C.
2. E is present but must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
3. R, A, and N cannot appear in any subsequent guesses.

For the second guess:
- Start with C (position 1 is fixed).
- Include E in position 2, 3, or 4 to test new positions.
- Use new common letters not yet tested (avoid R, A, N).
- Avoid placing E in position 5.

After considering options like ""CELTS"" and ""CHEAP"" (which contains excluded A), ""CHEST"" was chosen:
- Starts with C (meeting position 1).
- Positions E at position 3 (untested position).
- Introduces new common letters: H (position 2), S (position 4), T (position 5).
- Avoids R, A, N and reused letters from incorrect positions.

This guess maximizes new information by testing E's position and covering additional common consonants.

<guess>chest</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: chest -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) E(-) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the accumulated feedback:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R, A, N are not in the word (x).
- E is present but not in position 5 (-), so E is in the secret word at positions 2, 3, or 4.

From Guess 2 (""chest""):
- C is still correct and in position 1 (✓). This is consistent and reinforces position 1 is fixed.
- H is not in the word (x). So H cannot be used.
- E is still present but not in position 3 (since we got - for position 3 in this guess). This means E is not at position 3, and combined with Guess 1, E is not at position 5 either. So E must be at position 2 or 4.
- S and T are not in the word (x). Both are eliminated.

Summary of constraints:
- Position 1: C (fixed, known letter).
- Position 2: Must be E? Or could be something else? We know E is at position 2 or 4.
- Letters excluded: R, A, N, H, S, T.
- E is in the word at position 2 or 4 only (since position 3 and 5 are ruled out).
- Possible positions for E: 2 and 4 remain.

Deductions:
- We have tried positions 1, 3, and 5 for non-E letters that were eliminated (except position 2 which hasn't been tested with E).
- Position 2: Was H in second guess, which is eliminated. But we have E that must be at position 2 or 4.

Now, for the next guess:
- We must include E since it is known to be present.
- Place E at position 2 or position 4 to test which one is correct.
- Position 1 remains C.
- We need to fill the other positions with entirely new letters that haven't been tested and are not excluded.
- Excluded letters: R, A, N, H, S, T.

Available letters: All English letters except those excluded: so avoid R, A, N, H, S, T.

Letters used so far: C, R, A, N, E, H, S, T → So letters still available: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
But we need common ones.

Our goal: Determine if E is at position 2 or position 4.

Strategy:
Option 1: Place E at position 2 in this guess. If we get ✓ for position 2, then we know E is at 2. If we get -, that would imply E is not at position 2 (and must be at position 4). But note: if we place E at position 2 and get -, that would be inconsistent because if E is present, position 2 is a possible location, and if it's there, we get ✓. If it's not there and we placed it, we get -? But we know E is either at position 2 or position 4. If we put E at position 2 and get ✓, it's correct. If we get -, it means E is not at position 2, so it must be at position 4.

Option 2: Place E at position 4. If ✓, it's at 4. If -, it could be elsewhere? But we know E is either at position 2 or 4, so if not at 4, must be at 2.

But we also need to test other letters to fill the word.

Since we have limited guesses, we should prioritize identifying E's position while testing new letters.

Also, position 3 and 5 are unknown and need filling.

Choose a word that:
- Starts with C.
- Places E at either position 2 or position 4.
- Uses new common letters not excluded.

First, try to place E at position 2.

Possible words starting with CE.

But avoid excluded letters R,A,N,H,S,T.

So CE followed by 3 letters from available pool.

Common words:
- CEDED? Not eligible because D repeated? But let's find valid words.
- CELLO? But L and O? But CELLO has L (available) and O (available). But CELLO: C-E-L-L-O. Positions 3 and 4 are L and L? Position 5 O.
But CELLO has two L's? And E at position 2.
But E is at position 2? And L and O are new? Avoids R,A,N,H,S,T? Yes.

Another word: CABLE? But contains A? A is excluded, so no.

CEMENT? But 6 letters? Too long? No, we need 5-letter word.

CEILI? Not a word.

Reasonable words: CEIBO? Not common? CELOM? Not English?

Better go with common words.

CUBED? But U,B,E,D? E is supposed to be at position 2? But CUBED is C-U-B-E-D, so E is at position 4? Not 2.

For position 2: CE___ words.

Examples: CEDED (C-E-D-E-D, so E at 2 and 4? But we have E at 2 only? Unless forced).

CELTS? But S is excluded? From guess 2, S is x? So not in word? So cannot use S.

CELTS has S? Excluded? No.

CELTS: C-E-L-T-S, but T and S both excluded? T is x in guess 2? So cannot use T either? Yes, T is excluded, S excluded.

Therefore, cannot use S or T.

Available letters: must not include R, A, N, H, S, T.

So possibilities for CE words: must fill positions 3,4,5 with 3 letters from B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? How about CELLA? Rare? Not words.

CEORL? Not common.

Perhaps CEIBA or not? Limited.

Option to place E at position 4.

Then the word would be C__E_?

Position 1: C, position 4: E.

Must fill positions 2,3,5 with available letters? And not excluded.

Common words: like CAMEO? But A excluded? CAME O? A is excluded? No.

Other: CAPER? But A and R excluded? No.

Cable? A excluded.

COWED? But O,W,E,D? And E at position 4? But COWED: C-O-W-E-D? Position 4 is E? But D is available? O? W? 

COWED is valid? Meaning forced submission? Yes.

But E at position 4? And positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:D? Avoids excluded letters? O, W, D not excluded? And E is placed? So yes.

Another word: COPED? C-O-P-E-D? E at position 4? Similar? O,P,D available? Yes.

CUBED? C-U-B-E-D? E at position 4? U,B,D available? Yes.

Now, among these, we also want to test common letters.

But what about position 3 and 5? They are open.

Given that we are placing E at position 4? Which is one of the possible locations? Then? If we get ✓ for E, great? If not? Then it must be at position 2? So we learn either way? 

Moreover, in this guess, we also test letters in positions 2 and 3.

So? For example, if we guess ""COWED"":
- If E is not at position 4, we get - for E? But if E is at position 4? We get ✓? Also positions 2 and 3 are O and W? Which might be present or not? 

Similarly? Other letters? 

But we have position 5? Must fill.

Since position 1 is fixed? Position 4 could be E or not? We are testing.

But we know E is either at position 2 or position 4? So if we place E at position 4? And get dash? Then E must be at position 2? Because those are the only possibilities? So we learn E's position from this feedback? Either ✓ or - -> if ✓? Position 4? If -? Then position 4 not? Then must be position 2? So yes? We can determine? 

Moreover, we test three new letters? In positions 2,3,5.

For example? ""CUBED""?: C U B E D? Positions: 1: C? Fixed? ✓ always? 2: U? May be? Not excluded? 3: B? New? 4: E? Position we test? 5: D? New.

Similarly? ""COPED""? C O P E D? Similar? Common letters? ""COWED"" also.

To choose: select one that has common letters? B,P,D,O,U? Etc.

""COPED"" seems good? Because O and P are common.

Another candidate: ""COVED""? C O V E D? Also possible? But V is less common.

Or ""CAGED""? But A excluded? No.

""CLIMB""? But no E? We must include E? Because we know E is present? But if we omit E? We don't test E's position? That would be bad? Because we want to confirm where E is? 

So words without E at position 2 or 4 won't help? So we should avoid.

Therefore: ""COPED"" or ""CUBED"" or ""COWED""? 

Let me see: we also have letters to test? But since E is placed at position4? And if it works? Then position4 is solved? If not? Then we know position2 must be E? 

But in position2? Currently we have in COPED: O? Which is new? 

Perhaps choose a word that places E at position2? But earlier we had difficulty finding words with E at position2 without excluded letters? 

For position2 E? Words like CE: C E _ _ _?

With filled from available letters? Must use letters not excluded and not used? 

Possible words: CEDED? C-E-D-E-D? But D repeated? And E repeated? 

But available letters? It's a valid word? But messy? 

Other: CEZED? Not a word? CELOM? Not? 

Better? CEIBO? Not? 

Cella: CELLO? Earlier? But position3 and4: L L? Position5: O? But L repeated? CELLO is 5 letters? C-E-L-L-O? How common is it?

But L and O available? No excluded? 

So ""CELLO"": C E L L O? E at position2? Then if feedback: 
- Position1: C ✓
- Position2: E ? Either ✓ or -? But we know E must be at position2 or4? If E is at position2, we get ✓? If not? Then we get -? Which means E is at position4? Then we know? 

Also, L at position3 and position4? O position5? L and O are common? 

But there's a duplicate L? Which might complicate? But if L is in the word? We get feedback accordingly? 

So ""CELLO"" is an option? 

Comparing to placing E at position4? 

To decide? ""CELLO"" with E at position2? Vs ""COPED"" with E at position4? 

Each tests a different position for E? And introduces three new letters? 

Since time is limited? And ""COPED"" seems simpler? Because no duplicates? Yes? 

Therefore? Let's use ""COPED""? 

""CUBED"" also? 

Both are valid? 

Let me choose ""COPED"" as it uses O and P? Which are high frequency? 

So guess: ""COPED"" 

This guess: C O P E D? 

If E is at position4? Feedback: 
- Position4: E✓? Then we know E is at4? 
- Position4: E-? Then E must be at position2? 

And we get feedback on O, P, D? 

Even if it's dash? We learn something? 

Similarly? 

So? Final decision: Guess ""COPED"" 

But let's verify excluded: R,A,N,H,S,T are excluded? COPED has C,O,P,E,D? No excluded? Yes? 

Word is valid? Yes? Copied? Past tense of cope? 

So? 

<guess>coped</guess> 

Thought below? 

In summary? After two guesses? We know: 
- Word starts with C? 
- E present at position2 or4? 
- Excluded: R,A,N,H,S,T? 

Third guess: ""COPED"" places E at position4? To test? And uses O at position2? P at position3? D at position5? All new letters? 

This will give clear feedback on E?s position? And also on O,P,D?Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(✓), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  Insights:  
  - Position 1 is fixed as ""C"".  
  - Letters ""R"", ""A"", and ""N"" are excluded (not in the word).  
  - ""E"" is in the word but not in position 5 (must be in position 2, 3, or 4).  

- **Guess 2: ""chest""**  
  Feedback: C(✓), H(x), E(-), S(x), T(x)  
  Insights:  
  - Position 1 is ""C"" (confirmed again).  
  - ""H"", ""S"", and ""T"" are excluded (not in the word).  
  - ""E"" is not in position 3 (because it returned ""-""), so it must be in position 2 or 4 (since position 5 is already ruled out from Guess 1).  

**Summary of known information:**  
- Position 1 is ""C"".  
- ""E"" must be in position 2 or 4.  
- Excluded letters (not in the word): R, A, N, H, S, T.  
- Letters not yet tested: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

**Strategy for this guess:**  
We need to determine if ""E"" is in position 2 or position 4. To do this efficiently, place ""E"" in position 4 to test this possibility:  
- If the feedback shows ""E"" as ✓ in position 4, it is correct.  
- If ""E"" is -, it means ""E"" is in position 2 (the only other option).  
Additionally, fill the other positions with common, untested letters to gain more information:  
- Position 2: Use a new vowel/consonant (e.g., ""O"").  
- Position 3: Use a common consonant (e.g., ""P"").  
- Position 5: Use a common consonant (e.g., ""D"").  
The word **""COPED""** fits well:  
- Starts with ""C"" (position 1 fixed).  
- Places ""E"" in position 4 (to test the position).  
- Uses new letters ""O"", ""P"", and ""D"" (all untested and not excluded).  
- Avoids duplicates and excluded letters.  

After this guess, the feedback will clarify:  
- If ""E"" is ✓ at position 4, it is solved.  
- If ""E"" is -, ""E"" must be at position 2.  
- Feedback for ""O"", ""P"", and ""D"" will reveal if they are in the word and their positions.

The secret word starts with C (because C is correct and in position 1).\n2. The secret word contains the letter E, but not at the end (position 5). So E must be in one of the positions 2, 3, or 4.\n3. The letters R, A, and N are completely absent from the secret word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word:\n- Position 1: C\n- Contains E (but not at position 5, and not at position 1 obviously) so in 2,3, or 4.\n- Does not contain R, A, or N.\n\nWe need to make a second guess that:\n- Starts with C (since position 1 is fixed).\n- Does not include R, A, or N (these are out).\n- Includes E (but not at position 5) and we are to try to place E in a position we haven\'t tried (so positions 2,3, or 4).\n- We also want to test other common letters that haven\'t been tried yet to get more information.\n\nAvailable letters: We know R, A, N are out. We have already used C and E. So we should avoid those and also avoid R,A,N.\n\nBut note: We must include E somewhere? Actually, we don\'t have to force it in the second guess because we already know E is in the word, but we are trying to find its position. However, including E again in a different position can help. But consider that we are limited to 5 letters and we cannot use R,A,N.\n\nWe also note that we don\'t know letters in positions 2,3,4,5. We only know position 1 is C and that E is present but not in the same position as before.\n\nGood strategy: Try a word that starts with C and has E in one of the positions 2,3,4, and adds three new letters that are common and haven\'t been tried.\n\nPreviously we used: C, R, A, N, E. So avoid R,A,N and use new letters.\n\nCommon letters left: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\nLet\'s think of words starting with C and having E in position 2,3, or 4.\n\nPossible positions for E:\n- Position 2: then the word would be C E _ _ _\n- Position 3: then C _ E _ _\n- Position 4: then C _ _ E _\n\nWe also know that E cannot be at position 5 (from the first feedback).\n\nLet\'s brainstorm some words:\n\nOption 1: E in position 2 -> words like CEIL_, CELT_, ... but we avoid R,A,N.\n\nWords: CEILS (but that\'s 5 letters? CEILS is not a word? Actually, CEILS is not valid). How about:\n\n- CEDES? But D and S are new. However, E is at position 2? But we had E in position 5 in the first guess, now we put E in position 2? That might be good.\n\nBut note: the feedback for E was dash, meaning E is in the word but not in the fifth position. So if we put E in position 2, that might be the place.\n\nBut we are not sure which position E is in, so we want to test E in a different position? Actually, putting E in position 2 would be testing a new position.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid repeating E? But we must include E because we know it\'s in the word? Actually, no rule says we must include the known letter, but it\'s useful to do so to find the position.\n\nHowever, we can also choose a word without E to rule out other letters? But that might be inefficient because we already know E is present and we have limited guesses. So including E again is better.\n\nWe need to preserve the known information: position 1 is C and E is present.\n\nSo let\'s look for a word that starts with C and has E somewhere else (not position 1 and not position 5) and does not contain R, A, N.\n\nPossible words:\n- With E at position 2: CELTS (this is valid? CELT: a type of stone tool? Plural: CELTS). But wait, CELTS is 5 letters? C-E-L-T-S -> that works. And letters L,T,S are new.\n- Other words: CEILS (not a word), CEDED (past form of cede, 5 letters: but D is repeated? C-E-D-E-D -> wait, that\'s 6 letters? No, CEDED is 5: C-E-D-E-D -> no, that has 5 letters? Positions: [C,E,D,E,D]? Actually, C-E-D-E-D is 5 letters? Word: CEDED has two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has repeated letters.\n\nBut note: our first word was ""crane"" and had unique letters. The secret word might have duplicates? We don\'t know.\n\nBut the feedback: we had only one E marked as dash, which doesn\'t rule out more than one E. But in ""crane"", there was one E. So we don\'t know.\n\nSo let\'s consider CELTS: C-E-L-T-S. This has E at position 2. And letters L,T,S are new and not in the exclusion list (R,A,N).\n\nAlternatively, with E at position 3: \n- Words: CHESS? Has R? No, CHESS: C-H-E-S-S -> E is at position 3. And H,S are new. But S is repeated? Let\'s see: C-H-E-S-S -> that is 5 letters? Yes. The word ""chess"" is 5 letters: positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:S, 5:S? Actually, no: CHESS is spelled C-H-E-S-S? That\'s 5: C, H, E, S (for position 4 and 5? Actually, it\'s C-H-E-S-S? Wait, no: the word CHESS is standardly spelled as C-H-E-S-S? I think that\'s correct: C at 1, H at 2, E at 3, S at 4 and S at 5? That would use two S\'s? But that\'s okay.\n\nBut note: the feedback for E was dash meaning E is present but not in the position we guessed. We guessed E at position 5 and found it\'s not at 5. Now we are putting E at position 3? That might be the correct position or not? We are testing.\n\nBut in CHESS, position 5 would be S? That\'s okay? And H is also a new letter? But what about the feedback? We are avoiding R,A,N so CHESS is okay? But CHESS has two S\'s? How does the feedback handle duplicates? We need to be cautious.\n\nAnother word: CLOSE? But that has O and S? And E at the end? Position: C-L-O-S-E -> E at position 5. We already know E is not at position 5? Because we got dash for E in the first guess meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s wrong? So it\'s a waste.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid putting E at position 5 because we already know it\'s not there.\n\nSo our new guess should have E in positions 2,3, or 4.\n\nBack to words:\n- E at position 3: COPES? C-O-P-E-S -> E at position 4? Actually, position: 1:C, 2:O, 3:P, 4:E, 5:S. That would work. And letters O,P,S are new.\n\nBut we also have: CITED? But T and I are new? But I is a vowel? C-I-T-E-D -> that has E at position 4? And D. But wait, we have the letter T? That\'s new.\n\nBut I got another idea: Since we know E is in the word and not at 1 or 5, let\'s try to cover more common letters.\n\nCommon letters that haven\'t been tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.\n\nSo a good candidate: try ""CLOSE"" but that puts E at 5? Which is bad? Because we know E is not at 5. So let\'s not.\n\nBetter: ""COULD"" -> but that\'s 5 letters? C-O-U-L-D, and E? We are skipping E? It would be better to include E to test its position.\n\nWait, what about ""CELLO""? But CELLO is 5 letters? C-E-L-L-O -> E at position 2? But L repeated? And O? This includes L and O? But we tested E at 2? And we can test L and O? However, if the secret word doesn\'t have two L\'s, we\'ll get feedback accordingly? Okay.\n\nBut let me see: We can also use ""CHEST"" -> C-H-E-S-T: E at position 3? This covers H,E,S,T? Also, no repeated letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""CHESS"" has repeated S? So ""CHEST"" is better: unique letters? But ""ch"" and then ""es"" and ""t""? Yes: C-H-E-S-T.\n\nThat sounds good? Let\'s see: letters: C, H, E, S, T? Avoids R,A,N? Yes.\n\nAnother word: ""CIBED""? Not standard? Or ""CEDIS"" (monetary unit)? But these are less common? It\'s okay? But common words are better.\n\nSo I think ""CHEST"" is a good candidate? Because:\n- Starts with C (fixed)\n- Has E at position 3? This tests E in a new position (position 3)\n- Tests new letters H, S, T\n\nAlternatively, if E might be at position 2? We can test E at position 2 with a word like ""CELTS""? But ""CELTS"" might be less common? But acceptable? Similarly, ""CEILI"" is not a word? So ""CELTS"" is acceptable.\n\nConsidering the feedback, we want to maximize information. Since we don\'t know where E is, if we place it at a position we haven\'t tried? We tried E at 5? So positions 2,3,4 are fresh.\n\nSo either position 2,3, or 4? So both ""CELTS"" and ""CHEST"" are okay? But ""CHEST"" tests E at position 3? We haven\'t tried E in a position in the middle? So it\'s good? Also, ""CHEST"" has more common letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""COWER""? But wait: C-O-W-E-R -> has E and R? But we know R is absent? Because feedback for R was ""x"" meaning not in word? So we cannot use R? Therefore, ""COWER"" is invalid because it has R? Which is eliminated? So we must avoid R? And A and N? Similarly, ""CHEST"": H-E-S-T? No R,A,N? So okay?\n\nBut ""CHEST"": letters: C, H, E, S, T? And position: \n1: C (fixed and known correct? Actually, we already know C is correct at position 1? So we are testing the rest? But regardless, it\'s okay? Because we are required to make a new word? And we are confirming position 1? It is always good? But the feedback for C will be checkmark again? Which we don\'t need? But that\'s how the game works.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with E at position 2: CEASES? no? That has A? But A is excluded? Not allowed? Because we got A with x? So no A. So no word ... how about ""CELLA""? Not common? Or ""CETYL"" too rare? ""CEDED"" has D repeated? But E at position 2? Also ""CEDED"" has E at position 2 and 4? But possibly. However, D is new? Let me check ""CEDED"": C-E-D-E-D? That is 5 letters: positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:D, 4:E, 5:D? So two E\'s and two D\'s? Then the feedback for E? It might be confusing? Because if there are two E\'s? But we don\'t know? So maybe avoid duplicates? For simplicity.\n\nTherefore, ""CHEST"" seems a solid choice? Or ""CHEWY""? But Y? And no E in visible position? ""CHEWY"": E is at position 3? And W,Y? So okay? But ""CHEST"" uses S and T? Which are common? So better?\n\nSimilarly, ""CHOSE"": but that has O? And E at 5? But we cannot put E at 5? So invalid? Because we know E isn\'t at 5? So avoid words that end with E? For now? So ""CHEST"" ends with T? Good.\n\nSo I think I\'ll go with ""CHEST"". But let\'s see the letters? We are introducing H, E, S, T? And we avoid R,A,N? Yes.\n\nWait, but E? We know E is in the word? So we are putting it at position 3? We hope to find feedback on that.\n\nAfter getting feedback on ""CHEST"", we can deduce whether E is at position 3? Or not? If we get a check on E? Then it is? Or dash? Or x? Actually, we know E is in the word? So we cannot get x? Therefore, for E: we\'ll either get ✓ (if at position 3) or - (if it\'s not at 3 but in the word? We know it\'s in the word). But the dash for E in the first guess meant the letter is present but not at that position? Similarly, here? If at position 3? It will be ✓? If not? Then dash? But it cannot be x? Because it\'s in the word? So the feedback for E will be:\n- ✓: if it is at position 3? Then we know? \n- -: if it is present? But then we know it is present anyway? And if it\'s not at position 3? Then it must be at position 2 or 4? Because we already know it isn\'t at 5? And not at 1? Then if we get dash? That tells us nothing new? Except that it\'s not at position 3? But we already know it\'s present? So we learn its position isn\'t 3? Which is information? But we have only one position left? Or two? Position 2,3,4? So if we rule out 3? Then positions 2 and 4? And if position 2? We didn\'t test it? We are testing position 3? So if we get dash? Then we know E must be at 2 or 4? But we haven\'t tested position 2? Will position 2 be tested? In this word? We are not testing position 2? Position 2 is H? So if E were at position2? Then for ""CHEST"" the E at position3 would be not present? But E is present? What? Wait? Actually? There can only be one E? Or two? We don\'t know? So if E is at position2? Then for ""CHEST"":\n- The E at position3? That\'s not in the secret word? So that\'s x? But wait? How does the game handle duplicates? \n\nOh? Important: if the secret word has one E? And we guess a word with two E\'s? Then? The game\'s feedback only considers duplicate letters? Based on the secret word\'s count. In Wordle? If a letter appears one time? Then only one E is given feedback? So? Suppose the secret word has one E? Then our guess of ""teste"" might have? \n\nBut in our case? Our first word was ""crane"" with one E? The secret word must have at least one E? But not at position5? Now? Our guess ""CHEST"" has one E? At position3? So if the secret word has E at position3? Then we get ✓? If the secret word has E at position2? Then we will get: \n- Position 3 E: not found? So an x? Because the secret word has only one E? Already highlighted elsewhere? Or? Actually? The rules: the feedback indicates for each letter if it is in the word? But? Only once? \n\nClarification? How many E\'s? We don\'t know? So we have to be cautious? The feedback for ""CHEST"" if E is at position2? Then:\n- C: check? Because position1 is C? \n- H: if the secret word doesn\'t have H? Then x? \n- E: at position3? The secret word has an E? But at position2? So? Then the E at position3? Since it\'s not matching? And the secret word has only one E? Then the E in our guess would be marked? Position3: x? Because the E is already recognized at? Wait? But the positions? \n\nActually? The feedback:\n- The secret word has E? Then a dash for E? If it appears elsewhere? So? For ""CHEST"": \n  If E is at position2? Then:\n    Position1: C -> ✓? \n    Position2: H -> but the secret word has E? So H at position2? Might be not E? So x? \n    Position3: E -> but the secret word has E at position2? Only? Then E at position3? Is not matching? Since E is already covered by the one at position2? So we get x? \n\nBut let me check an example? Suppose secret word: CREEP? Not applicable? Because we only have one E? \n\nBut we need to understand? The rules: if the letter is present? And not matched? Then dash? But in the first guess? We had E at position5? But E is present? But not at5? So dash? Then? Similarly? For E? It gets a dash per occurrence? If there are duplicates? \n\nBut for simplicity? Since we don\'t know if there is more than one E? Then? In ""CHEST"": \n- If E is at position2? Then for our E at position3? We might get dash if there are two E\'s? Or x if only one E? Because the E was already counted at position2? \n\nI think? The game marks both as follows? \n- First? Find exact matches? So position? Then? From left? Any letter not matched? But in the word? Gets a dash? And any letter not in word? Gets x? \n\nSo? If the secret word has one E? Then?\nGuess1: E? Not exact? But E is present? So dash? Then?\nGuess2: E again? If placed correctly? Check? Otherwise? Dash or x? \n\nWait? But if the secret word has one E? And we guess two E\'s? Then? If one E is exactly at the right position? Then the other? E? That isn\'t? Will be marked x? Because? When parsing? The exact matched E is counted? Then? The other E? In our guess? Is not in the word? Because? The secret word has only one E? Which was already matched? So? The other E gets x? \n\nBut if the secret word has two E\'s? Then? Both E\'s? Could be matches or dashes? \n\nGiven? We only knew? E is somewhere? So we don\'t know the count? \n\nBut in CHEST? Only one E? So? In secret word? If E is at position2? Then? \nOur guess: \n- Position1: C? Correct? \n- Position2: H? Is it E? Or something else? \n- Position3: E? \nThe secret? Position1: C? Position2: E? Position3: something? \nSo? \n- Position1: C? Matches? So ✓? \n- Position2: H? Secret has E at2? So? E is not H? But H is not E? And H? So? Is H in the word? Not E? But? The secret word at position2 is E? So? Letter H? It may or may not be in the word? Maybe not? \n\nActually? For position2: H? \nIf H is not in the secret word? Then x? \nAnd position3: E? The secret has E but at position2? So? E at position3? The secret has E at position2? But? Position3 is not E? So? The E? In guess position3? Is not matching? And? Because? There\'s only one E? Which was already used? So? We get x? Or dash? \n\nThis becomes complex? \n\nAlternatively? We can avoid duplicates to reduce complexity? Therefore? Choose a word with E only once? And in a previously uncovered position? \n\nBut I think? It\'s safer to choose a word that puts E in a position where we have not tried? And doesn\'t introduce duplicates? \n\nSo? Back to? ""CLOSE"" puts E at5? Which is bad? So avoid? \n\nWord ""CHEAP""? But has A? Which is excluded? Because A was x? So no? \n\n""CHEST"" is good? \n- Doesn\'t have A? Doesn\'t have R? Doesn\'t have N? \n- Has E at position3? \n- New letters: H, S, T? \n\nTherefore? Let\'s guess ""CHEST""? \n\nBut wait? What about ""CEDED""? I think? Let\'s check? \n\nBetter? Use? ""CELLO"": \nC E L L O? E at position2? And L? But two L\'s? So? That might be confusing? \n\nAlternatively? ""CETUS?"" not common? \n\nSo? ""CHEST"" it is? Or ""CHUTE""? \n""CHUTE"": C-H-U-T-E? But E at5? Which we know it\'s not? So avoid? \n\nTherefore? I\'ll go with? ""CHEST""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""cra ne"":\n- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- R, A, and N are not in the secret word at all (x).\n- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (-).\n\nThis means:\n1. The secret word starts with C.\n2. E is present but must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n3. R, A, and N cannot appear in any subsequent guesses.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Start with C (position 1 is fixed).\n- Include E in position 2, 3, or 4 to test new positions.\n- Use new common letters not yet tested (avoid R, A, N).\n- Avoid placing E in position 5.\n\nAfter considering options like ""CELTS"" and ""CHEAP"" (which contains excluded A), ""CHEST"" was chosen:\n- Starts with C (meeting position 1).\n- Positions E at position 3 (untested position).\n- Introduces new common letters: H (position 2), S (position 4), T (position 5).\n- Avoids R, A, N and reused letters from incorrect positions.\n\nThis guess maximizes new information by testing E\'s position and covering additional common consonants.\n\n<guess>chest</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: chest -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) E(-) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the accumulated feedback:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (""crane""):\n- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- R, A, N are not in the word (x).\n- E is present but not in position 5 (-), so E is in the secret word at positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFrom Guess 2 (""chest""):\n- C is still correct and in position 1 (✓). This is consistent and reinforces position 1 is fixed.\n- H is not in the word (x). So H cannot be used.\n- E is still present but not in position 3 (since we got - for position 3 in this guess). This means E is not at position 3, and combined with Guess 1, E is not at position 5 either. So E must be at position 2 or 4.\n- S and T are not in the word (x). Both are eliminated.\n\nSummary of constraints:\n- Position 1: C (fixed, known letter).\n- Position 2: Must be E? Or could be something else? We know E is at position 2 or 4.\n- Letters excluded: R, A, N, H, S, T.\n- E is in the word at position 2 or 4 only (since position 3 and 5 are ruled out).\n- Possible positions for E: 2 and 4 remain.\n\nDeductions:\n- We have tried positions 1, 3, and 5 for non-E letters that were eliminated (except position 2 which hasn\'t been tested with E).\n- Position 2: Was H in second guess, which is eliminated. But we have E that must be at position 2 or 4.\n\nNow, for the next guess:\n- We must include E since it is known to be present.\n- Place E at position 2 or position 4 to test which one is correct.\n- Position 1 remains C.\n- We need to fill the other positions with entirely new letters that haven\'t been tested and are not excluded.\n- Excluded letters: R, A, N, H, S, T.\n\nAvailable letters: All English letters except those excluded: so avoid R, A, N, H, S, T.\n\nLetters used so far: C, R, A, N, E, H, S, T → So letters still available: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\nBut we need common ones.\n\nOur goal: Determine if E is at position 2 or position 4.\n\nStrategy:\nOption 1: Place E at position 2 in this guess. If we get ✓ for position 2, then we know E is at 2. If we get -, that would imply E is not at position 2 (and must be at position 4). But note: if we place E at position 2 and get -, that would be inconsistent because if E is present, position 2 is a possible location, and if it\'s there, we get ✓. If it\'s not there and we placed it, we get -? But we know E is either at position 2 or position 4. If we put E at position 2 and get ✓, it\'s correct. If we get -, it means E is not at position 2, so it must be at position 4.\n\nOption 2: Place E at position 4. If ✓, it\'s at 4. If -, it could be elsewhere? But we know E is either at position 2 or 4, so if not at 4, must be at 2.\n\nBut we also need to test other letters to fill the word.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we should prioritize identifying E\'s position while testing new letters.\n\nAlso, position 3 and 5 are unknown and need filling.\n\nChoose a word that:\n- Starts with C.\n- Places E at either position 2 or position 4.\n- Uses new common letters not excluded.\n\nFirst, try to place E at position 2.\n\nPossible words starting with CE.\n\nBut avoid excluded letters R,A,N,H,S,T.\n\nSo CE followed by 3 letters from available pool.\n\nCommon words:\n- CEDED? Not eligible because D repeated? But let\'s find valid words.\n- CELLO? But L and O? But CELLO has L (available) and O (available). But CELLO: C-E-L-L-O. Positions 3 and 4 are L and L? Position 5 O.\nBut CELLO has two L\'s? And E at position 2.\nBut E is at position 2? And L and O are new? Avoids R,A,N,H,S,T? Yes.\n\nAnother word: CABLE? But contains A? A is excluded, so no.\n\nCEMENT? But 6 letters? Too long? No, we need 5-letter word.\n\nCEILI? Not a word.\n\nReasonable words: CEIBO? Not common? CELOM? Not English?\n\nBetter go with common words.\n\nCUBED? But U,B,E,D? E is supposed to be at position 2? But CUBED is C-U-B-E-D, so E is at position 4? Not 2.\n\nFor position 2: CE___ words.\n\nExamples: CEDED (C-E-D-E-D, so E at 2 and 4? But we have E at 2 only? Unless forced).\n\nCELTS? But S is excluded? From guess 2, S is x? So not in word? So cannot use S.\n\nCELTS has S? Excluded? No.\n\nCELTS: C-E-L-T-S, but T and S both excluded? T is x in guess 2? So cannot use T either? Yes, T is excluded, S excluded.\n\nTherefore, cannot use S or T.\n\nAvailable letters: must not include R, A, N, H, S, T.\n\nSo possibilities for CE words: must fill positions 3,4,5 with 3 letters from B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? How about CELLA? Rare? Not words.\n\nCEORL? Not common.\n\nPerhaps CEIBA or not? Limited.\n\nOption to place E at position 4.\n\nThen the word would be C__E_?\n\nPosition 1: C, position 4: E.\n\nMust fill positions 2,3,5 with available letters? And not excluded.\n\nCommon words: like CAMEO? But A excluded? CAME O? A is excluded? No.\n\nOther: CAPER? But A and R excluded? No.\n\nCable? A excluded.\n\nCOWED? But O,W,E,D? And E at position 4? But COWED: C-O-W-E-D? Position 4 is E? But D is available? O? W? \n\nCOWED is valid? Meaning forced submission? Yes.\n\nBut E at position 4? And positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:D? Avoids excluded letters? O, W, D not excluded? And E is placed? So yes.\n\nAnother word: COPED? C-O-P-E-D? E at position 4? Similar? O,P,D available? Yes.\n\nCUBED? C-U-B-E-D? E at position 4? U,B,D available? Yes.\n\nNow, among these, we also want to test common letters.\n\nBut what about position 3 and 5? They are open.\n\nGiven that we are placing E at position 4? Which is one of the possible locations? Then? If we get ✓ for E, great? If not? Then it must be at position 2? So we learn either way? \n\nMoreover, in this guess, we also test letters in positions 2 and 3.\n\nSo? For example, if we guess ""COWED"":\n- If E is not at position 4, we get - for E? But if E is at position 4? We get ✓? Also positions 2 and 3 are O and W? Which might be present or not? \n\nSimilarly? Other letters? \n\nBut we have position 5? Must fill.\n\nSince position 1 is fixed? Position 4 could be E or not? We are testing.\n\nBut we know E is either at position 2 or position 4? So if we place E at position 4? And get dash? Then E must be at position 2? Because those are the only possibilities? So we learn E\'s position from this feedback? Either ✓ or - -> if ✓? Position 4? If -? Then position 4 not? Then must be position 2? So yes? We can determine? \n\nMoreover, we test three new letters? In positions 2,3,5.\n\nFor example? ""CUBED""?: C U B E D? Positions: 1: C? Fixed? ✓ always? 2: U? May be? Not excluded? 3: B? New? 4: E? Position we test? 5: D? New.\n\nSimilarly? ""COPED""? C O P E D? Similar? Common letters? ""COWED"" also.\n\nTo choose: select one that has common letters? B,P,D,O,U? Etc.\n\n""COPED"" seems good? Because O and P are common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""COVED""? C O V E D? Also possible? But V is less common.\n\nOr ""CAGED""? But A excluded? No.\n\n""CLIMB""? But no E? We must include E? Because we know E is present? But if we omit E? We don\'t test E\'s position? That would be bad? Because we want to confirm where E is? \n\nSo words without E at position 2 or 4 won\'t help? So we should avoid.\n\nTherefore: ""COPED"" or ""CUBED"" or ""COWED""? \n\nLet me see: we also have letters to test? But since E is placed at position4? And if it works? Then position4 is solved? If not? Then we know position2 must be E? \n\nBut in position2? Currently we have in COPED: O? Which is new? \n\nPerhaps choose a word that places E at position2? But earlier we had difficulty finding words with E at position2 without excluded letters? \n\nFor position2 E? Words like CE: C E _ _ _?\n\nWith filled from available letters? Must use letters not excluded and not used? \n\nPossible words: CEDED? C-E-D-E-D? But D repeated? And E repeated? \n\nBut available letters? It\'s a valid word? But messy? \n\nOther: CEZED? Not a word? CELOM? Not? \n\nBetter? CEIBO? Not? \n\nCella: CELLO? Earlier? But position3 and4: L L? Position5: O? But L repeated? CELLO is 5 letters? C-E-L-L-O? How common is it?\n\nBut L and O available? No excluded? \n\nSo ""CELLO"": C E L L O? E at position2? Then if feedback: \n- Position1: C ✓\n- Position2: E ? Either ✓ or -? But we know E must be at position2 or4? If E is at position2, we get ✓? If not? Then we get -? Which means E is at position4? Then we know? \n\nAlso, L at position3 and position4? O position5? L and O are common? \n\nBut there\'s a duplicate L? Which might complicate? But if L is in the word? We get feedback accordingly? \n\nSo ""CELLO"" is an option? \n\nComparing to placing E at position4? \n\nTo decide? ""CELLO"" with E at position2? Vs ""COPED"" with E at position4? \n\nEach tests a different position for E? And introduces three new letters? \n\nSince time is limited? And ""COPED"" seems simpler? Because no duplicates? Yes? \n\nTherefore? Let\'s use ""COPED""? \n\n""CUBED"" also? \n\nBoth are valid? \n\nLet me choose ""COPED"" as it uses O and P? Which are high frequency? \n\nSo guess: ""COPED"" \n\nThis guess: C O P E D? \n\nIf E is at position4? Feedback: \n- Position4: E✓? Then we know E is at4? \n- Position4: E-? Then E must be at position2? \n\nAnd we get feedback on O, P, D? \n\nEven if it\'s dash? We learn something? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nSo? Final decision: Guess ""COPED"" \n\nBut let\'s verify excluded: R,A,N,H,S,T are excluded? COPED has C,O,P,E,D? No excluded? Yes? \n\nWord is valid? Yes? Copied? Past tense of cope? \n\nSo? \n\n<guess>coped</guess> \n\nThought below? \n\nIn summary? After two guesses? We know: \n- Word starts with C? \n- E present at position2 or4? \n- Excluded: R,A,N,H,S,T? \n\nThird guess: ""COPED"" places E at position4? To test? And uses O at position2? P at position3? D at position5? All new letters? \n\nThis will give clear feedback on E?s position?

We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position; not position 5)

Guess 2: ""chest""
- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- H: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but not position 3)
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""coped""
- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- O: - (in the word but not position 2)
- P: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but not position 4)
- D: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The word starts with 'C' (position 1 is fixed).
2. The letter 'E' is in the word, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from guesses 1, 2, and 3). Since the only positions left are 1 and 2, but position 1 is 'C', so 'E' must be in position 2.
   - From guess 1: E not in 5.
   - From guess 2: E not in 3.
   - From guess 3: E not in 4.
   - Therefore, E must be in position 2.

3. Excluded letters (not in the word): R, A, N, H, S, T, P, D (from the x's in feedback). Also, from guess 3, O is present (because of the dash) but not in position 2.

4. So the word has:
   - Position 1: C
   - Position 2: E (as we just deduced)
   - Position 3: ? (unknown, but not any excluded letter)
   - Position 4: ? (unknown, but not any excluded letter)
   - Position 5: ? (unknown, but not any excluded letter)

5. Also, we know that 'O' is in the word (from guess 3: O is present but not in position 2). So O must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5.

Now, the known letters in the word are: C, E, O (and we know E is at position 2, but O is somewhere else).

Excluded letters: R, A, N, H, S, T, P, D.

Available letters: We have used C, E, O, and the excluded ones. So we can use: B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that O is already in the word, so it might appear again? But we don't know. We should avoid using O again if possible to test new letters, but it's not necessary.

The word structure: C E _ _ _

We know O is in the word, so it must be in one of the blanks (positions 3,4,5).

We need to make a guess that:
- Starts with ""CE""
- Includes the letter O (to find its position, and because we know it's in the word)
- Uses only available letters (avoid R,A,N,H,S,T,P,D)

Possible words: We need 5-letter words starting with ""CE"" and containing an ""O"" (which must be in positions 3,4, or 5), and no excluded letters.

Let's think of common words:

- ""CELLO"": But L is available? Yes, but ""CELLO"" has two L's. Also, note that in ""CELLO"", the O is at position 5. But we have to check if it uses excluded letters? C E L L O. Excluded letters are R,A,N,H,S,T,P,D. L is not excluded. So it's okay? But we have two L's? We don't know if the word has duplicates.

But let's see: we need to test the positions. However, we are not forced to avoid duplicates. But we can use it.

Another word: ""CEORL""? Not common.

""CEIBA""? Not common.

""CELEB""? Not a standard word for ""celebrity"", but sometimes used? But it's 5 letters? C-E-L-E-B? But E is repeated? And we already know E is at position 2? So position 4 is E? But we have feedback that E is not at position 4 (from guess 3: E in ""coped"" at position 4 got dash, meaning E is not at 4). So we cannot have E at position 4? Therefore, words with E at position 4 are invalid? Because we know E is only at position 2? So we must not put E again? Because the word has only one E? Or we don't know? 

Wait, we deduced that E must be at position 2. So the secret word has E at position 2, and no other E? Or possibly? But from the feedback, we have:

In guess 1: E was at position 5 and got dash -> meaning E is present but not at 5.
In guess 2: E at position 3 and got dash -> present but not at 3.
In guess 3: E at position 4 and got dash -> present but not at 4.

And since position 1 is C, the only position left for E is 2. So the secret word has exactly one E, at position 2.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should not put E in any other position? Because we know it's only at 2? So we can have E only at position 2? And no other E? Because if we put E at another position, it would be wrong? But we are using the guess to confirm? Actually, we are confident that E is at 2? So we can fix E at 2 and not use it elsewhere.

So the word is: C E ? ? ? 

And we know O is in the word (from guess 3: O is present) and must be in one of positions 3,4,5.

So we need a word: C E ? ? ? that includes O and uses only available letters.

Available letters: B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and O, but we are including O).

Common words:

- ""CELLO"": C E L L O -> positions: 3:L, 4:L, 5:O. This has O at position 5? And L at 3 and 4? But L repeated? And we don't know if L is in the word? But it's a valid guess.

- ""CEORL"": not common.

- ""CEBID""? Not common.

- ""CEILI""? Not a word.

- ""CEMBO""? Not common.

- ""CENTO""? But N is excluded? N was excluded from guess 1? So no.

- ""CERCI""? But R and C? R excluded? No.

So ""CELLO"" seems a reasonable choice? But let's see if there are others.

Another word: ""CEIBA""? Not common.

""JUMBO""? Doesn't start with CE.

We need to start with CE.

""CELEB""? As I thought? But it has E at position 4? But we cannot have E at position 4? Because we know E is only at 2? So if we put ""CELEB"": C E L E B? Then position 4 is E? But we know E is not at 4? So that would be inconsistent? And also, the feedback would mark the second E as x? Because the secret word has only one E? So it's not efficient? So avoid.

Therefore, ""CELLO"" is a good candidate? But it has two L's? We can use it? Because L is not excluded.

Another word: ""CELOM""? Not common.

""CEZVE""? Not common.

So let's go with ""CELLO"". It tests:
- Position 3: L
- Position 4: L (so if L is in the word, we get feedback on both)
- Position 5: O (we know O is in the word, so if it's at position 5, we get ✓, else dash or x? But we know O is in the word? So if at position 5, ✓, else dash? Because it's present but wrong position? Unless it's at position 3 or 4? But we have L there? 

But we are trying to find the position of O? So if we get O at position 5 as ✓, then we know? If not? Then O must be at position 3 or 4? But in this guess, position 3 and 4 are L? So if O is at position 3? Then in ""CELLO"", position 3 is L? So O would be marked as dash? But we have O at position 5? So if O is at position 3? Then the O at position 5 would be marked as dash? Because it's present but not at 5? But we know O is in the word? So we get feedback accordingly.

But note: if the secret word has O at position 3, then in ""CELLO"":
- Position 1: C ✓
- Position 2: E ✓ (we assume E is at 2? But we are guessing to confirm? Actually, we are confident? But let's see)
- Position 3: L? But secret has O? So L is not O? So if L is not in the word? Then x? 
- Position 4: L? If the secret word has only one L? Then the first L might be dash if L is present elsewhere? But we don't know? 
- Position 5: O? But secret has O at position 3? So O at position 5 is not correct? But O is present? So dash? 

This might be messy? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O in a different position? And without duplicates? 

For example, ""CEORL"" is not common? 

""CEVEX""? Not a word.

""CEBIL""? Not common.

Another idea: ""COMET""? But T is excluded? From guess 2? T is excluded? So no.

""COVET""? T excluded? And V? But doesn't start with CE? We must start with CE? Because position 1 and 2 are fixed? We know position 2 is E? So we must put E at position 2? 

So the word must start with CE? 

Therefore, ""CELLO"" is one of the few options? 

We can try ""CEIBO""? Not common? 

""CEILI""? Not.

So I think ""CELLO"" is acceptable? 

But let's see if there is a word with O in position 3? For example, ""CEORL"" is not? 

""CEOLS""? But S is excluded? 

""CELEG""? Not a word? 

So I'll go with ""CELLO"". 

But note: we are not 100% sure that E is at position 2? But from deduction, it must be? So we can proceed? 

Therefore, the next guess is ""CELLO"". 

But let's double-check the deduction: 

- E must be in the word? 
- Positions available: 1,2,3,4,5? 
- Position 1: C? So not E? 
- Position 5: not E (from guess 1)? 
- Position 3: not E (from guess 2)? 
- Position 4: not E (from guess 3)? 
- Therefore, only position 2 left? So E must be at position 2? 

Yes? So we are confident? 

So the secret word is C E ? ? ? 

And we know O is in the word? So in ""CELLO"", we are testing L and O? 

So guess: ""CELLO"" 

But in the feedback, we will get: 
- Position 1: C ✓ (always)
- Position 2: E ✓ (if our deduction is correct? Then it should be ✓? But we are guessing to confirm? Actually, we are using the guess to also get more letters? 

But if we get E at position 2 as ✓, then we confirm? 

If not? Then our deduction is wrong? But it should be? 

So? 

<guess>cello</guess> 

But let's write it? 

Alternatively, if we want to be safe? We could choose a word that doesn't assume E at 2? But we are confident? 

Another word: ""COLIC""? But doesn't start with CE? We must start with C? But position 2 is not fixed? We think it is E? But we haven't confirmed? 

In the feedback, we have not seen E at position 2? But we have eliminated all other positions? 

So I think it's safe? 

Therefore, we guess ""CELLO"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

Let's break down the feedback from all guesses to deduce the secret word:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
   - **C** is correct and in position 1.  
   - **R, A, N** are not in the word.  
   - **E** is in the word but not in position 5.  

2. **Guess 2: ""chest"" → C(✓) H(x) E(-) S(x) T(x)**  
   - **C** is correct (position 1 confirmed).  
   - **H, S, T** are not in the word.  
   - **E** is in the word but not in position 3.  

3. **Guess 3: ""coped"" → C(✓) O(-) P(x) E(-) D(x)**  
   - **C** is correct (position 1 confirmed).  
   - **O** is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - **P, D** are not in the word.  
   - **E** is in the word but not in position 4.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Position 1 is fixed as ""C""** (all 3 guesses confirm this).  
- **""E"" must be in position 2**:  
  - From Guess 1: E is not in position 5.  
  - From Guess 2: E is not in position 3.  
  - From Guess 3: E is not in position 4.  
  - Since position 1 is ""C"", the only remaining position for E is 2.  
- **Excluded letters (not in the word)**: R, A, N, H, S, T, P, D (all marked ""x"" in feedback).  
- **""O"" is in the word** (marked ""-"" in Guess 3) but not in position 2. It must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- **Secret word structure**: `C E _ _ _`  
  - Position 1: C (fixed).  
  - Position 2: E (deduced).  
  - Positions 3, 4, 5: Unknown, but must include ""O"" and two other letters from the remaining pool.  

### Available Letters:
- Excluded: R, A, N, H, S, T, P, D.  
- Available: B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- Since ""O"" is confirmed in the word, it must appear in one of positions 3–5.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- The word must start with **""CE""** (positions 1–2 fixed).  
- Include **""O""** to test its position (3, 4, or 5).  
- Use **new, common letters** from the available pool to maximize information.  
- Avoid duplicates and excluded letters.  

### Chosen Guess: ""CELLO""
- **C E L L O**  
  - Tests ""O"" in position 5 (common position for ""O"" in 5-letter words).  
  - Tests ""L"" in positions 3 and 4 (common consonant, not yet tried).  
- Why this word?  
  - Fits the `C E _ _ _` structure.  
  - Includes ""O"" (required).  
  - Uses ""L"" (high-frequency letter) in two positions to test for presence/position.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters.  
- Potential outcomes:  
  - If ""O"" is in position 5, feedback will show ✓.  
  - If ""O"" is not in position 5, feedback will show ""-"" (since we know it's in the word).  
  - Feedback for ""L"" will reveal if it's in the word and its position(s).  

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while leveraging deductions from previous feedback.

<guess>cello</guess>",cello,"We have the following feedback from previous guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position; not position 5)

Guess 2: ""chest""
- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- H: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but not position 3)
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""coped""
- C: ✓ (correct position, position 1)
- O: - (in the word but not position 2)
- P: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but not position 4)
- D: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The word starts with 'C' (position 1 is fixed).
2. The letter 'E' is in the word, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from guesses 1, 2, and 3). Since the only positions left are 1 and 2, but position 1 is 'C', so 'E' must be in position 2.
   - From guess 1: E not in 5.
   - From guess 2: E not in 3.
   - From guess 3: E not in 4.
   - Therefore, E must be in position 2.

3. Excluded letters (not in the word): R, A, N, H, S, T, P, D (from the x's in feedback). Also, from guess 3, O is present (because of the dash) but not in position 2.

4. So the word has:
   - Position 1: C
   - Position 2: E (as we just deduced)
   - Position 3: ? (unknown, but not any excluded letter)
   - Position 4: ? (unknown, but not any excluded letter)
   - Position 5: ? (unknown, but not any excluded letter)

5. Also, we know that 'O' is in the word (from guess 3: O is present but not in position 2). So O must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5.

Now, the known letters in the word are: C, E, O (and we know E is at position 2, but O is somewhere else).

Excluded letters: R, A, N, H, S, T, P, D.

Available letters: We have used C, E, O, and the excluded ones. So we can use: B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that O is already in the word, so it might appear again? But we don't know. We should avoid using O again if possible to test new letters, but it's not necessary.

The word structure: C E _ _ _

We know O is in the word, so it must be in one of the blanks (positions 3,4,5).

We need to make a guess that:
- Starts with ""CE""
- Includes the letter O (to find its position, and because we know it's in the word)
- Uses only available letters (avoid R,A,N,H,S,T,P,D)

Possible words: We need 5-letter words starting with ""CE"" and containing an ""O"" (which must be in positions 3,4, or 5), and no excluded letters.

Let's think of common words:

- ""CELLO"": But L is available? Yes, but ""CELLO"" has two L's. Also, note that in ""CELLO"", the O is at position 5. But we have to check if it uses excluded letters? C E L L O. Excluded letters are R,A,N,H,S,T,P,D. L is not excluded. So it's okay? But we have two L's? We don't know if the word has duplicates.

But let's see: we need to test the positions. However, we are not forced to avoid duplicates. But we can use it.

Another word: ""CEORL""? Not common.

""CEIBA""? Not common.

""CELEB""? Not a standard word for ""celebrity"", but sometimes used? But it's 5 letters? C-E-L-E-B? But E is repeated? And we already know E is at position 2? So position 4 is E? But we have feedback that E is not at position 4 (from guess 3: E in ""coped"" at position 4 got dash, meaning E is not at 4). So we cannot have E at position 4? Therefore, words with E at position 4 are invalid? Because we know E is only at position 2? So we must not put E again? Because the word has only one E? Or we don't know? 

Wait, we deduced that E must be at position 2. So the secret word has E at position 2, and no other E? Or possibly? But from the feedback, we have:

In guess 1: E was at position 5 and got dash -> meaning E is present but not at 5.
In guess 2: E at position 3 and got dash -> present but not at 3.
In guess 3: E at position 4 and got dash -> present but not at 4.

And since position 1 is C, the only position left for E is 2. So the secret word has exactly one E, at position 2.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should not put E in any other position? Because we know it's only at 2? So we can have E only at position 2? And no other E? Because if we put E at another position, it would be wrong? But we are using the guess to confirm? Actually, we are confident that E is at 2? So we can fix E at 2 and not use it elsewhere.

So the word is: C E ? ? ? 

And we know O is in the word (from guess 3: O is present) and must be in one of positions 3,4,5.

So we need a word: C E ? ? ? that includes O and uses only available letters.

Available letters: B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and O, but we are including O).

Common words:

- ""CELLO"": C E L L O -> positions: 3:L, 4:L, 5:O. This has O at position 5? And L at 3 and 4? But L repeated? And we don't know if L is in the word? But it's a valid guess.

- ""CEORL"": not common.

- ""CEBID""? Not common.

- ""CEILI""? Not a word.

- ""CEMBO""? Not common.

- ""CENTO""? But N is excluded? N was excluded from guess 1? So no.

- ""CERCI""? But R and C? R excluded? No.

So ""CELLO"" seems a reasonable choice? But let's see if there are others.

Another word: ""CEIBA""? Not common.

""JUMBO""? Doesn't start with CE.

We need to start with CE.

""CELEB""? As I thought? But it has E at position 4? But we cannot have E at position 4? Because we know E is only at 2? So if we put ""CELEB"": C E L E B? Then position 4 is E? But we know E is not at 4? So that would be inconsistent? And also, the feedback would mark the second E as x? Because the secret word has only one E? So it's not efficient? So avoid.

Therefore, ""CELLO"" is a good candidate? But it has two L's? We can use it? Because L is not excluded.

Another word: ""CELOM""? Not common.

""CEZVE""? Not common.

So let's go with ""CELLO"". It tests:
- Position 3: L
- Position 4: L (so if L is in the word, we get feedback on both)
- Position 5: O (we know O is in the word, so if it's at position 5, we get ✓, else dash or x? But we know O is in the word? So if at position 5, ✓, else dash? Because it's present but wrong position? Unless it's at position 3 or 4? But we have L there? 

But we are trying to find the position of O? So if we get O at position 5 as ✓, then we know? If not? Then O must be at position 3 or 4? But in this guess, position 3 and 4 are L? So if O is at position 3? Then in ""CELLO"", position 3 is L? So O would be marked as dash? But we have O at position 5? So if O is at position 3? Then the O at position 5 would be marked as dash? Because it's present but not at 5? But we know O is in the word? So we get feedback accordingly.

But note: if the secret word has O at position 3, then in ""CELLO"":
- Position 1: C ✓
- Position 2: E ✓ (we assume E is at 2? But we are guessing to confirm? Actually, we are confident? But let's see)
- Position 3: L? But secret has O? So L is not O? So if L is not in the word? Then x? 
- Position 4: L? If the secret word has only one L? Then the first L might be dash if L is present elsewhere? But we don't know? 
- Position 5: O? But secret has O at position 3? So O at position 5 is not correct? But O is present? So dash? 

This might be messy? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has O in a different position? And without duplicates? 

For example, ""CEORL"" is not common? 

""CEVEX""? Not a word.

""CEBIL""? Not common.

Another idea: ""COMET""? But T is excluded? From guess 2? T is excluded? So no.

""COVET""? T excluded? And V? But doesn't start with CE? We must start with CE? Because position 1 and 2 are fixed? We know position 2 is E? So we must put E at position 2? 

So the word must start with CE? 

Therefore, ""CELLO"" is one of the few options? 

We can try ""CEIBO""? Not common? 

""CEILI""? Not.

So I think ""CELLO"" is acceptable? 

But let's see if there is a word with O in position 3? For example, ""CEORL"" is not? 

""CEOLS""? But S is excluded? 

""CELEG""? Not a word? 

So I'll go with ""CELLO"". 

But note: we are not 100% sure that E is at position 2? But from deduction, it must be? So we can proceed? 

Therefore, the next guess is ""CELLO"". 

But let's double-check the deduction: 

- E must be in the word? 
- Positions available: 1,2,3,4,5? 
- Position 1: C? So not E? 
- Position 5: not E (from guess 1)? 
- Position 3: not E (from guess 2)? 
- Position 4: not E (from guess 3)? 
- Therefore, only position 2 left? So E must be at position 2? 

Yes? So we are confident? 

So the secret word is C E ? ? ? 

And we know O is in the word? So in ""CELLO"", we are testing L and O? 

So guess: ""CELLO"" 

But in the feedback, we will get: 
- Position 1: C ✓ (always)
- Position 2: E ✓ (if our deduction is correct? Then it should be ✓? But we are guessing to confirm? Actually, we are using the guess to also get more letters? 

But if we get E at position 2 as ✓, then we confirm? 

If not? Then our deduction is wrong? But it should be? 

So?

But let's write it? 

Alternatively, if we want to be safe? We could choose a word that doesn't assume E at 2? But we are confident? 

Another word: ""COLIC""? But doesn't start with CE? We must start with C? But position 2 is not fixed? We think it is E? But we haven't confirmed? 

In the feedback, we have not seen E at position 2? But we have eliminated all other positions? 

So I think it's safe? 

Therefore, we guess ""CELLO"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback
