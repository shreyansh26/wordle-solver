We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Interpretation:
1. The letter 'C' is in the secret word and it is the first letter because it's marked correct.
   - So, the secret word starts with C.
2. The letter 'R' is in the secret word but not in the second position (since it was in the second position in our guess but feedback says wrong position).
3. 'A' is not in the secret word at all.
4. 'N' is not in the secret word at all.
5. 'E' is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (it was in the fifth position in our guess).

Therefore, we know:
- The word starts with 'C'.
- The word contains 'R' and 'E', but neither is in the position we guessed.
- The word does not contain 'A' or 'N'.

We must avoid using 'A' and 'N' in future guesses.

Now, let's think about positions:
- Since 'C' is fixed at position 1, we have: C _ _ _ _
- 'R' is in the word but not at position 2. So it must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5.
- 'E' is in the word but not at position 5. So it must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Starts with 'C'
- Includes 'R' and 'E' (but not in the positions we already know are wrong: R not at 2, E not at 5)
- Excludes 'A' and 'N'
- And we can use other letters, preferably common ones.

We also want to test possible positions for R and E.

Let's consider words that start with C and contain R and E.

We know that E cannot be at position 5, and R cannot be at position 2.

Possible words? We don't know the word, but we can try a word that fits these constraints and uses new letters to get more information.

Example: Try a word like ""CREPT"", but note that we have E at position 3, and R at position 2. But we know R cannot be at position 2. So ""CREPT"" puts R at position 2 which is forbidden.

We need R somewhere else. How about ""CRWTH""? That's too obscure.

Let's think of common words: 
- We could do ""CRESS"" but note that E is at position 3 and S is repeated? We don't know if repeats are allowed? The rules say 5-letter English word, but doesn't specify unique letters. However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. But since our feedback for ""crane"" didn't show repeated, we don't know.

But we don't have any repeated letters in the first guess, so we can't rule them out.

However, to maximize information, we can try a word with distinct letters we haven't tried.

Letters we have tried: C, R, A, N, E. We know A and N are absent. So available letters: all others.

We need to include R and E in the new word, but not in the positions we know they are not.

So let's consider:
- Position 2: cannot be R, and we don't know what it is. We can try another vowel? But A is out. So vowels: E (but E might be elsewhere), O, I, U? Or consonant?

We know E is in the word but not at position 5. So E must be at 2,3, or4? But we don't know.

We also must place R at 3,4, or5? Because it can't be at 2.

Now, since the first letter is C, let's find words of the form: C _ _ _ _

We can try putting R at position 3 and E at position 4? For example, ""CURED""? But what about U?

Alternatively, to test E at position 2: that would be ""CE___"". But we don't know if that's valid.

Some possibilities: 
- ""CREME"" -> but E at position 4 and 5? And we know E cannot be at position 5. Also, we haven't tested M.

We don't want to use E at position 5 because we know it's not there.

So maybe we can try E at position 2? Then the word is ""CE___"". For example, ""CERT""? No, it's 5 letters? 

""CEILS"" -> but that has L and S. Or ""CELEB""? Not a word.

Common words: 
- ""CREST"": 
  - C at 1 (good)
  - R at 2? But we know R is not at position 2. So if we use ""CREST"", R is at position 2, which we know is wrong. That would be wasting a guess.

We need to avoid putting R at position 2.

How about ""CODER""? 
- C at 1 (good)
- O at 2 (new, and a vowel)
- D at 3 (new)
- E at 4 (and note, we put E at position 4, which is allowed because we only know it's not at 5)
- R at 5? We previously had R at position 2 and now at 5? We also have E at position 4.

But we must check if we avoid A and N: yes.

But maybe we can do better? Because we want to test positions.

Another idea: since R must be in position 3,4, or 5, and E must be in 2,3, or4, we can design a guess that might clarify more.

What about ""CLEAR""? But we avoid A because A is not in the word! So we cannot use A.

So ""CLEAR"" is invalid because A is forbidden.

Similarly, ""CURED"": 
- C at1, U at2, R at3, E at4, D at5.
This avoids A and N and has E at position 4 (not 5) and R at position 3 (not 2). So that's acceptable.
We also get to test U, D and confirm E and R.

We haven't tested U and D yet.

Alternatively, we could test other common consonants.

But let's think about what we need to discover: we need to know the positions of R and E and the two other letters.

Another good option: ""CRUEL"". 
- C at1
- R at2: oh, but that is the position we know is wrong for R. So that's not allowed? In the feedback, R was marked as in the word but wrong position when at position 2. So putting R at position 2 again would be wrong. In fact, it's known to be incorrect so we shouldn't do that.

Hence, we must choose a word where R is not at position 2.

Therefore, ""CRUEL"" is invalid because R is at 2.

How about ""CREPT"": same issue, R at position 2.

We need a word without R at position 2.

Let me list some words: 
- ""CABLE"" -> but we cannot use A. So no.
- ""CEDAR"" -> contains A, forbidden.
- ""CREDE"" -> not a common word?
- ""CREPE"" -> E at position 5? But E cannot be at position 5. Also, R at position 2 which is forbidden.

So we need R in positions 3,4, or5.

What common words start with C and have R at position 3? 
- E.g. ""CAROM"" -> but A is in it. Forbidden.
- ""CURSE"": C at1, U at2, R at3, S at4, E at5 -> but E at position 5? We know E cannot be at position 5. So that's invalid.

Similarly, ""CORSE"": O at2, R at3, S at4, E at5: E at5, which is forbidden.

Therefore, we cannot have E at position 5.

So we need E at positions 2,3, or4.

And R at positions 3,4, or5.

But also, R cannot be at the same position as E? Not necessarily.

Possible structure:
- If we put E at position 2: then the word is C E _ _ _
  - Then R must be in positions 3,4,5: so like ""C E R _ _"" or ""C E _ R _"" or ""C E _ _ R""

Examples: 
- ""CEROS"" -> a word? Plural of zero? Not sure.
- ""CERYL""? Probably not.

More common: ""CEFR""? No.

Alternatively, ""CEASE"" -> has A. Forbidden.

How about putting E at position 4: then word structure C _ _ E _

And R at position 5? Then ""C _ _ E R""

Or R at position 3: ""C _ R E _""

Examples:
- ""C U R E D"": as I thought earlier -> but is it a word? Yes, ""cured"".

Other options: ""CITED"" -> doesn't have R? We must include R because we know it's in the word.

We must include R and E.

Another word: ""CORED"": C O R E D
- C at1: good.
- O at2: new.
- R at3: but we originally had R at position 2 and know it's not there. Position 3 is new. We hope this might be right? Possible.
- E at4: we know E is in the word and not at5, and here it's at position 4. Possible.
- D at5: new.

Also, avoids A and N. So ""cored"" is a valid word.

Similarly, another candidate: ""CRONE"" -> but contains N? Not allowed because N is not in the word? We know N is absent. Oh, feedback said N(x), so we cannot use N.

""CRONE"" has N? Oh, ""CRONE"": C R O N E -> N at position 4? But we know N is absent. So that's invalid.

Similarly, ""CROME""? Not a word.

Another one: ""CIRES"" -> C I R E S: 
- E is at position 4? Then R at 3? 
- Avoids A and N.

But we could do ""cores"" -> but that's 5 letters? ""cores"": C O R E S -> E at position 4? But we know E cannot be at position 4? Actually, no, we don't know. We know it's not at position 5. It could be at 4. But in ""cores"", E at4 and it is a word. But also, R at position 2? We know that is forbidden. Because in ""crane"", R at2 was marked as wrong position. So putting R at position 2 again? We shouldn't waste it.

Therefore, we must choose a word without R at position 2 and without E at position 5, and without A and N.

So back to ""cored"": C O R E D
- R is at position 3? That's safe because we don't know about position 3.
- E at position 4? Also safe.

And we haven't used O or D.

Another possibility: ""coled""? Not a common word.

""coved"": C O V E D -> similar.

But not as common as ""cored"".

Alternatively, ""cried"": C R I E D -> but R at position 2? Forbidden.

So ""cored"" seems reasonable.

Another one: ""creme"" -> but E at position 5? We know position 5 cannot be E.

And ""creed"" -> E at5? Forbidden.

""crews"" -> R at position 2? Forbidden.

So ""cored"" might be a good choice.

But note: we have feedback from previous that E is not at position 5, but we don't know about position 4. Similarly, R is not at position 2.

Also, in ""cored"", we have R at position 3 and E at position 4.

If in the secret word, R is supposed to be at position 3 and E at position 4, we could get lucky.

Alternatively, if not, we will get new feedback.

We also test O and D.

But what about the letter E not being at position 5? Yes, in ""cored"", E is not at 5.

We can also consider ""cured"": C U R E D -> similar, but with U instead of O.

Both are valid.

Let's choose one. It doesn't matter much.

I'll go with ""cured"" because it tests U.

We haven't tested U.

So guess: CURED

Breakdown:
- C: should be ✓ because we know first letter is C? Actually, we know C is at position 1 and correct. So in CURED, C at1 should be correct.
- U: we don't know? We'll get feedback.
- R: we know R is in the word but not at position 2. Here it's at position 3 -> could be correct or misplaced? We don't know yet.
- E: at position 4, we know E is in the word and not at5, so position 4 might be correct or misplaced.
- D: unknown.

This gives us information about these positions.

Alternatively, ""cored"" uses O, which is a vowel.

I think both are acceptable.

Since R was misplaced at position 2 and E at position 5, shifting them to adjacent positions might help.

Let's lock in ""cured"".

So second guess: CURED

Response format: <guess>cured</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- The word starts with C (position 1).
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- A and N are not in the word.

Therefore:
– My next guess must start with C.
– It must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
– It cannot contain A or N.

To maximize new information, I'll choose a word that tests common letters not yet tried. ""CURED"" fits:
- Starts with C (position 1).
- Puts R at position 3 (avoiding position 2).
- Puts E at position 4 (avoiding position 5).
- Introduces U and D, which haven't been tested.
- Excludes A and N.

This helps narrow down the positions of R and E while testing two new letters.

<guess>cured</guess>",cured,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)

Also, avoids A and N. So ""cored"" is a valid word.

Similarly, another candidate: ""CRONE"" -> but contains N? Not allowed because N is not in the word? We know N is absent. Oh, feedback said N(x), so we cannot use N.

""CRONE"" has N? Oh, ""CRONE"": C R O N E -> N at position 4? But we know N is absent. So that's invalid.

Similarly, ""CROME""? Not a word.

Another one: ""CIRES"" -> C I R E S: 
- E is at position 4? Then R at 3? 
- Avoids A and N.

But we could do ""cores"" -> but that's 5 letters? ""cores"": C O R E S -> E at position 4? But we know E cannot be at position 4? Actually, no, we don't know. We know it's not at position 5. It could be at 4. But in ""cores"", E at4 and it is a word. But also, R at position 2? We know that is forbidden. Because in ""crane"", R at2 was marked as wrong position. So putting R at position 2 again? We shouldn't waste it.

Therefore, we must choose a word without R at position 2 and without E at position 5, and without A and N.

So back to ""cored"": C O R E D
- R is at position 3? That's safe because we don't know about position 3.
- E at position 4? Also safe.

And we haven't used O or D.

Another possibility: ""coled""? Not a common word.

""coved"": C O V E D -> similar.

But not as common as ""cored"".

Alternatively, ""cried"": C R I E D -> but R at position 2? Forbidden.

So ""cored"" seems reasonable.

Another one: ""creme"" -> but E at position 5? We know position 5 cannot be E.

And ""creed"" -> E at5? Forbidden.

""crews"" -> R at position 2? Forbidden.

So ""cored"" might be a good choice.

But note: we have feedback from previous that E is not at position 5, but we don't know about position 4. Similarly, R is not at position 2.

Also, in ""cored"", we have R at position 3 and E at position 4.

If in the secret word, R is supposed to be at position 3 and E at position 4, we could get lucky.

Alternatively, if not, we will get new feedback.

We also test O and D.

But what about the letter E not being at position 5? Yes, in ""cored"", E is not at 5.

We can also consider ""cured"": C U R E D -> similar, but with U instead of O.

Both are valid.

Let's choose one. It doesn't matter much.

I'll go with ""cured"" because it tests U.

We haven't tested U.

So guess: CURED

Breakdown:
- C: should be ✓ because we know first letter is C? Actually, we know C is at position 1 and correct. So in CURED, C at1 should be correct.
- U: we don't know? We'll get feedback.
- R: we know R is in the word but not at position 2. Here it's at position 3 -> could be correct or misplaced? We don't know yet.
- E: at position 4, we know E is in the word and not at5, so position 4 might be correct or misplaced.
- D: unknown.

This gives us information about these positions.

Alternatively, ""cored"" uses O, which is a vowel.

I think both are acceptable.

Since R was misplaced at position 2 and E at position 5, shifting them to adjacent positions might help.

Let's lock in ""cured"".

So second guess: CURED

Response format: <guess>cured</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- The word starts with C (position 1).
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- A and N are not in the word.

Therefore:
– My next guess must start with C.
– It must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
– It cannot contain A or N.

To maximize new information, I'll choose a word that tests common letters not yet tried. ""CURED"" fits:
- Starts with C (position 1).
- Puts R at position 3 (avoiding position 2).
- Puts E at position 4 (avoiding position 5).
- Introduces U and D, which haven't been tested.
- Excludes A and N.

This helps narrow down the positions of R and E while testing two new letters.",Guess 2: cured -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(x) R(✓) E(✓) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,corer,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Interpretation:
1. The letter 'C' is in the secret word and it is the first letter because it's marked correct.
   - So, the secret word starts with C.
2. The letter 'R' is in the secret word but not in the second position (since it was in the second position in our guess but feedback says wrong position).
3. 'A' is not in the secret word at all.
4. 'N' is not in the secret word at all.
5. 'E' is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (it was in the fifth position in our guess).

Therefore, we know:
- The word starts with 'C'.
- The word contains 'R' and 'E', but neither is in the position we guessed.
- The word does not contain 'A' or 'N'.

We must avoid using 'A' and 'N' in future guesses.

Now, let's think about positions:
- Since 'C' is fixed at position 1, we have: C _ _ _ _
- 'R' is in the word but not at position 2. So it must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5.
- 'E' is in the word but not at position 5. So it must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Starts with 'C'
- Includes 'R' and 'E' (but not in the positions we already know are wrong: R not at 2, E not at 5)
- Excludes 'A' and 'N'
- And we can use other letters, preferably common ones.

We also want to test possible positions for R and E.

Let's consider words that start with C and contain R and E.

We know that E cannot be at position 5, and R cannot be at position 2.

Possible words? We don't know the word, but we can try a word that fits these constraints and uses new letters to get more information.

Example: Try a word like ""CREPT"", but note that we have E at position 3, and R at position 2. But we know R cannot be at position 2. So ""CREPT"" puts R at position 2 which is forbidden.

We need R somewhere else. How about ""CRWTH""? That's too obscure.

Let's think of common words: 
- We could do ""CRESS"" but note that E is at position 3 and S is repeated? We don't know if repeats are allowed? The rules say 5-letter English word, but doesn't specify unique letters. However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. But since our feedback for ""crane"" didn't show repeated, we don't know.

But we don't have any repeated letters in the first guess, so we can't rule them out.

However, to maximize information, we can try a word with distinct letters we haven't tried.

Letters we have tried: C, R, A, N, E. We know A and N are absent. So available letters: all others.

We need to include R and E in the new word, but not in the positions we know they are not.

So let's consider:
- Position 2: cannot be R, and we don't know what it is. We can try another vowel? But A is out. So vowels: E (but E might be elsewhere), O, I, U? Or consonant?

We know E is in the word but not at position 5. So E must be at 2,3, or4? But we don't know.

We also must place R at 3,4, or5? Because it can't be at 2.

Now, since the first letter is C, let's find words of the form: C _ _ _ _

We can try putting R at position 3 and E at position 4? For example, ""CURED""? But what about U?

Alternatively, to test E at position 2: that would be ""CE___"". But we don't know if that's valid.

Some possibilities: 
- ""CREME"" -> but E at position 4 and 5? And we know E cannot be at position 5. Also, we haven't tested M.

We don't want to use E at position 5 because we know it's not there.

So maybe we can try E at position 2? Then the word is ""CE___"". For example, ""CERT""? No, it's 5 letters? 

""CEILS"" -> but that has L and S. Or ""CELEB""? Not a word.

Common words: 
- ""CREST"": 
  - C at 1 (good)
  - R at 2? But we know R is not at position 2. So if we use ""CREST"", R is at position 2, which we know is wrong. That would be wasting a guess.

We need to avoid putting R at position 2.

How about ""CODER""? 
- C at 1 (good)
- O at 2 (new, and a vowel)
- D at 3 (new)
- E at 4 (and note, we put E at position 4, which is allowed because we only know it's not at 5)
- R at 5? We previously had R at position 2 and now at 5? We also have E at position 4.

But we must check if we avoid A and N: yes.

But maybe we can do better? Because we want to test positions.

Another idea: since R must be in position 3,4, or 5, and E must be in 2,3, or4, we can design a guess that might clarify more.

What about ""CLEAR""? But we avoid A because A is not in the word! So we cannot use A.

So ""CLEAR"" is invalid because A is forbidden.

Similarly, ""CURED"": 
- C at1, U at2, R at3, E at4, D at5.
This avoids A and N and has E at position 4 (not 5) and R at position 3 (not 2). So that's acceptable.
We also get to test U, D and confirm E and R.

We haven't tested U and D yet.

Alternatively, we could test other common consonants.

But let's think about what we need to discover: we need to know the positions of R and E and the two other letters.

Another good option: ""CRUEL"". 
- C at1
- R at2: oh, but that is the position we know is wrong for R. So that's not allowed? In the feedback, R was marked as in the word but wrong position when at position 2. So putting R at position 2 again would be wrong. In fact, it's known to be incorrect so we shouldn't do that.

Hence, we must choose a word where R is not at position 2.

Therefore, ""CRUEL"" is invalid because R is at 2.

How about ""CREPT"": same issue, R at position 2.

We need a word without R at position 2.

Let me list some words: 
- ""CABLE"" -> but we cannot use A. So no.
- ""CEDAR"" -> contains A, forbidden.
- ""CREDE"" -> not a common word?
- ""CREPE"" -> E at position 5? But E cannot be at position 5. Also, R at position 2 which is forbidden.

So we need R in positions 3,4, or5.

What common words start with C and have R at position 3? 
- E.g. ""CAROM"" -> but A is in it. Forbidden.
- ""CURSE"": C at1, U at2, R at3, S at4, E at5 -> but E at position 5? We know E cannot be at position 5. So that's invalid.

Similarly, ""CORSE"": O at2, R at3, S at4, E at5: E at5, which is forbidden.

Therefore, we cannot have E at position 5.

So we need E at positions 2,3, or4.

And R at positions 3,4, or5.

But also, R cannot be at the same position as E? Not necessarily.

Possible structure:
- If we put E at position 2: then the word is C E _ _ _
  - Then R must be in positions 3,4,5: so like ""C E R _ _"" or ""C E _ R _"" or ""C E _ _ R""

Examples: 
- ""CEROS"" -> a word? Plural of zero? Not sure.
- ""CERYL""? Probably not.

More common: ""CEFR""? No.

Alternatively, ""CEASE"" -> has A. Forbidden.

How about putting E at position 4: then word structure C _ _ E _

And R at position 5? Then ""C _ _ E R""

Or R at position 3: ""C _ R E _""

Examples:
- ""C U R E D"": as I thought earlier -> but is it a word? Yes, ""cured"".

Other options: ""CITED"" -> doesn't have R? We must include R because we know it's in the word.

We must include R and E.

Another word: ""CORED"": C O R E D
- C at1: good.
- O at2: new.
- R at3: but we originally had R at position 2 and know it's not there. Position 3 is new. We hope this might be right? Possible.
- E at4: we know E is in the word and not at5, and here it's at position 4. Possible.
- D at5: new.

Also, avoids A and N. So ""cored"" is a valid word.

Similarly, another candidate: ""CRONE"" -> but contains N? Not allowed because N is not in the word? We know N is absent. Oh, feedback said N(x), so we cannot use N.

""CRONE"" has N? Oh, ""CRONE"": C R O N E -> N at position 4? But we know N is absent. So that's invalid.

Similarly, ""CROME""? Not a word.

Another one: ""CIRES"" -> C I R E S: 
- E is at position 4? Then R at 3? 
- Avoids A and N.

But we could do ""cores"" -> but that's 5 letters? ""cores"": C O R E S -> E at position 4? But we know E cannot be at position 4? Actually, no, we don't know. We know it's not at position 5. It could be at 4. But in ""cores"", E at4 and it is a word. But also, R at position 2? We know that is forbidden. Because in ""crane"", R at2 was marked as wrong position. So putting R at position 2 again? We shouldn't waste it.

Therefore, we must choose a word without R at position 2 and without E at position 5, and without A and N.

So back to ""cored"": C O R E D
- R is at position 3? That's safe because we don't know about position 3.
- E at position 4? Also safe.

And we haven't used O or D.

Another possibility: ""coled""? Not a common word.

""coved"": C O V E D -> similar.

But not as common as ""cored"".

Alternatively, ""cried"": C R I E D -> but R at position 2? Forbidden.

So ""cored"" seems reasonable.

Another one: ""creme"" -> but E at position 5? We know position 5 cannot be E.

And ""creed"" -> E at5? Forbidden.

""crews"" -> R at position 2? Forbidden.

So ""cored"" might be a good choice.

But note: we have feedback from previous that E is not at position 5, but we don't know about position 4. Similarly, R is not at position 2.

Also, in ""cored"", we have R at position 3 and E at position 4.

If in the secret word, R is supposed to be at position 3 and E at position 4, we could get lucky.

Alternatively, if not, we will get new feedback.

We also test O and D.

But what about the letter E not being at position 5? Yes, in ""cored"", E is not at 5.

We can also consider ""cured"": C U R E D -> similar, but with U instead of O.

Both are valid.

Let's choose one. It doesn't matter much.

I'll go with ""cured"" because it tests U.

We haven't tested U.

So guess: CURED

Breakdown:
- C: should be ✓ because we know first letter is C? Actually, we know C is at position 1 and correct. So in CURED, C at1 should be correct.
- U: we don't know? We'll get feedback.
- R: we know R is in the word but not at position 2. Here it's at position 3 -> could be correct or misplaced? We don't know yet.
- E: at position 4, we know E is in the word and not at5, so position 4 might be correct or misplaced.
- D: unknown.

This gives us information about these positions.

Alternatively, ""cored"" uses O, which is a vowel.

I think both are acceptable.

Since R was misplaced at position 2 and E at position 5, shifting them to adjacent positions might help.

Let's lock in ""cured"".

So second guess: CURED

Response format: <guess>cured</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- The word starts with C (position 1).
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

So that\'s invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""CORSE"": O at2, R at3, S at4, E at5: E at5, which is forbidden.\n\nTherefore, we cannot have E at position 5.\n\nSo we need E at positions 2,3, or4.\n\nAnd R at positions 3,4, or5.\n\nBut also, R cannot be at the same position as E? Not necessarily.\n\nPossible structure:\n- If we put E at position 2: then the word is C E _ _ _\n  - Then R must be in positions 3,4,5: so like ""C E R _ _"" or ""C E _ R _"" or ""C E _ _ R""\n\nExamples: \n- ""CEROS"" -> a word? Plural of zero? Not sure.\n- ""CERYL""? Probably not.\n\nMore common: ""CEFR""? No.\n\nAlternatively, ""CEASE"" -> has A. Forbidden.\n\nHow about putting E at position 4: then word structure C _ _ E _\n\nAnd R at position 5? Then ""C _ _ E R""\n\nOr R at position 3: ""C _ R E _""\n\nExamples:\n- ""C U R E D"": as I thought earlier -> but is it a word? Yes, ""cured"".\n\nOther options: ""CITED"" -> doesn\'t have R? We must include R because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nWe must include R and E.\n\nAnother word: ""CORED"": C O R E D\n- C at1: good.\n- O at2: new.\n- R at3: but we originally had R at position 2 and know it\'s not there. Position 3 is new. We hope this might be right? Possible.\n- E at4: we know E is in the word and not at5, and here it\'s at position 4. Possible.\n- D at5: new.\n\nAlso, avoids A and N. So ""cored"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, another candidate: ""CRONE"" -> but contains N? Not allowed because N is not in the word? We know N is absent. Oh, feedback said N(x), so we cannot use N.\n\n""CRONE"" has N? Oh, ""CRONE"": C R O N E -> N at position 4? But we know N is absent. So that\'s invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""CROME""? Not a word.\n\nAnother one: ""CIRES"" -> C I R E S: \n- E is at position 4? Then R at 3? \n- Avoids A and N.\n\nBut we could do ""cores"" -> but that\'s 5 letters? ""cores"": C O R E S -> E at position 4? But we know E cannot be at position 4? Actually, no, we don\'t know. We know it\'s not at position 5. It could be at 4. But in ""cores"", E at4 and it is a word. But also, R at position 2? We know that is forbidden. Because in ""crane"", R at2 was marked as wrong position. So putting R at position 2 again? We shouldn\'t waste it.\n\nTherefore, we must choose a word without R at position 2 and without E at position 5, and without A and N.\n\nSo back to ""cored"": C O R E D\n- R is at position 3? That\'s safe because we don\'t know about position 3.\n- E at position 4? Also safe.\n\nAnd we haven\'t used O or D.\n\nAnother possibility: ""coled""? Not a common word.\n\n""coved"": C O V E D -> similar.\n\nBut not as common as ""cored"".\n\nAlternatively, ""cried"": C R I E D -> but R at position 2? Forbidden.\n\nSo ""cored"" seems reasonable.\n\nAnother one: ""creme"" -> but E at position 5? We know position 5 cannot be E.\n\nAnd ""creed"" -> E at5? Forbidden.\n\n""crews"" -> R at position 2? Forbidden.\n\nSo ""cored"" might be a good choice.\n\nBut note: we have feedback from previous that E is not at position 5, but we don\'t know about position 4. Similarly, R is not at position 2.\n\nAlso, in ""cored"", we have R at position 3 and E at position 4.\n\nIf in the secret word, R is supposed to be at position 3 and E at position 4, we could get lucky.\n\nAlternatively, if not, we will get new feedback.\n\nWe also test O and D.\n\nBut what about the letter E not being at position 5? Yes, in ""cored"", E is not at 5.\n\nWe can also consider ""cured"": C U R E D -> similar, but with U instead of O.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nLet\'s choose one. It doesn\'t matter much.\n\nI\'ll go with ""cured"" because it tests U.\n\nWe haven\'t tested U.\n\nSo guess: CURED\n\nBreakdown:\n- C: should be ✓ because we know first letter is C? Actually, we know C is at position 1 and correct. So in CURED, C at1 should be correct.\n- U: we don\'t know? We\'ll get feedback.\n- R: we know R is in the word but not at position 2. Here it\'s at position 3 -> could be correct or misplaced? We don\'t know yet.\n- E: at position 4, we know E is in the word and not at5, so position 4 might be correct or misplaced.\n- D: unknown.\n\nThis gives us information about these positions.\n\nAlternatively, ""cored"" uses O, which is a vowel.\n\nI think both are acceptable.\n\nSince R was misplaced at position 2 and E at position 5, shifting them to adjacent positions might help.\n\nLet\'s lock in ""cured"".\n\nSo second guess: CURED\n\nResponse format: <guess>cured</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- The word starts with C (position 1).\n- R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n- A and N are not in the word.\n\nTherefore:\n– My next guess must start with C.\n– It must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.\n– It cannot contain A or N.\n\nTo maximize new information, I\'ll choose a word that tests common letters not yet tried. ""CURED"" fits:\n- Starts with C (position 1).\n- Puts R at position 3 (avoiding position 2).\n- Puts E at position 4 (avoiding position 5).\n- Introduces U and D, which haven\'t been tested.\n- Excludes A and N.\n\nThis helps narrow down the positions of R and E while testing two new letters.\n\n<guess>cured</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: cured -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(x) R(✓) E(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position) → so the first letter is C.
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R is in the word, but not at position 2.
- A: x (not in word) → A is absent.
- N: x (not in word) → N is absent.
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word, but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""cured""
- C: ✓ (correct position) → confirmed first letter C.
- U: x (not in word) → U is absent.
- R: ✓ (correct position) → R is at position 3.
- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is at position 4.
- D: x (not in word) → D is absent.

So now we know:
- The word starts with C, has R at position 3, and E at position 4. So the pattern is: C _ R E _
- We also know that the missing letters are the second and fifth positions.
- We know that A, N, U, and D are not in the word.

From the first guess, we also know that E is not at position 5 (which is consistent with the pattern above, since E is at 4) and R is not at position 2 (which is consistent because R is at 3).

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word of the form: C _ R E _

The second letter is unknown, and the fifth letter is unknown.

We also know that the word contains no A, N, U, or D.

We must avoid using these letters.

We have used the letters: C, R, E, and from the first guess we also used A, N (which are out) and from the second guess U and D (out). So we have used: C, R, E, A, N, U, D.

Available letters: all others.

We need to fill the second and fifth positions.

Common letters that could fit:

For the second position: it can be a vowel or consonant. Common vowels left: O, I, and sometimes Y? But let's see.

For the fifth position: any letter except the ones we know are absent.

We can try to think of words that fit: C _ R E _

Examples: 
- corey? Not a word.
- core? Only 4 letters.
- We need 5 letters.

Common words: 
- ""corey"" is not standard. 
- ""covey"" -> C O V E Y? That's 5 letters. But we don't know about V and Y.
- ""copse"" -> C O P S E? But E is at position 5? But in our pattern, E is at position 4, so the fifth is something else. ""copse"" has E at the end? Actually, ""copse"" is C O P S E -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:P, 4:S, 5:E. But we need position 3 to be R and position 4 to be E. So that doesn't match.

We need the third letter to be R and fourth to be E. So the word must be: [C] [letter2] [R] [E] [letter5]

So the pattern is fixed for positions 1,3,4.

Possible words:
- ""cares"" -> but A is forbidden, and also E is at position 4? ""cares"": C A R E S -> but A is not allowed.
- ""cores"": C O R E S -> this fits: C at1, O at2, R at3, E at4, S at5. And O and S are not forbidden? We haven't used O or S, and they are not in the absent list (A, N, U, D). So ""cores"" is a possibility.
- ""cokes"": C O K E S -> but position 3 is K, not R. Doesn't fit.
- ""cries"": C R I E S -> but position 2 is R? We know R is at position 3, so position 2 cannot be R. Also, in ""cries"", R is at position 2, which we know is wrong because from the first guess R was misplaced at position 2. So R cannot be at position 2. Therefore, ""cries"" is invalid because it forces R at position 2.

Similarly, ""crates"": too long? 6 letters? No, 6? ""crates"" is 6? C-R-A-T-E-S, 6 letters. We need 5.

Another word: ""creek"": C R E E K -> but position 2 is R? Again, R at position 2 is forbidden. Also, E at position 3? But we need R at position 3 and E at position 4. So no.

""creep"": same issue, R at position 2.

So back to ""cores"": C O R E S -> this seems to fit the pattern.

Other possibilities:
- ""cored"": but we used D in the second guess and D is absent? Feedback for ""cured"" had D(x), so D is not in the word. ""cored"" has D at the end? ""cored"" is C O R E D -> but D is absent, so it cannot be. We know D is not in the word.

Similarly, ""coves"": C O V E S -> but position 3 is V, not R. Doesn't fit.

""cores"" is one option.

Another: ""cires""? Not common.

""cares"" has A.

""ceres"": C E R E S -> but position 2 is E? We don't know if E can be at position 2? But we have E at position 4, and we don't know about duplicates. The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but it might be possible? However, in the first guess, E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position. Now we have E at position 4. If the word has only one E, then E cannot be at position 2. But we don't know if there are two E's? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates explicitly. For example, if a letter appears twice, the feedback might show multiple marks. But in ""crane"", we had one E and it was marked as present. In ""cured"", we had one E and it was correct at position 4. So if the secret word has only one E, then we cannot have E at position 2. But we don't know.

To be safe, let's assume that the word has only one E for now, because we haven't seen evidence of duplicates. So E is at position 4, so it cannot be at position 2.

Therefore, ""ceres"" would have E at position 2 and 4? That might be possible, but let's avoid for now.

Another word: ""cries"" we already saw has R at position 2, which is invalid.

""crones"": has N? N is absent.

""cares"": A absent.

So ""cores"" seems a strong candidate: C O R E S.

We also have ""coves"", but position 3 is V, not R.

""cores"" is the word.

But we need to confirm if ""cores"" is a valid word. Yes, it is (a plural of core, or a type of fruit? But in Wordle, it's accepted).

Another possibility: ""cukes""? C U K E S -> but U is absent, and position 3 is K, not R.

No.

""cures"": C U R E S -> but U is absent? We know U is not in the word from the second guess feedback. So ""cures"" has U at position 2, which is absent. So invalid.

Therefore, ""cores"" is a good guess because:
- It fits the pattern: C at1, O at2, R at3, E at4, S at5.
- It uses O and S, which are new and not excluded.
- It doesn't use any forbidden letters (A, N, U, D).

If ""cores"" is the secret word, we win. If not, we get feedback on O and S.

But we have only 6 tries, and this is the third guess.

We could also consider other words like ""bares"", but doesn't start with C.

Another word: ""cires""? Not common.

""cores"" seems the most straightforward.

But let's think: is there a word like ""crate""? But A is absent and it's 5 letters? ""crate"" has A and E at position 5? But we need E at position 4.

No.

""crete""? Not a word? Or proper noun.

I think ""cores"" is a good guess.

But we have to consider that the fifth letter might be something else.

Another common word: ""creek"" but doesn't fit.

""crepe"" has E at position 5? Forbidden.

So I'll go with ""cores"".

But in the pattern, we have C _ R E _, and we are guessing O for position 2 and S for position 5.

We could guess a word that tests more letters? But we have to fill the positions.

Since we know three letters, we can try to guess the entire word.

But we have two unknowns, so we need to test.

Another word: ""corns""? C O R N S -> but N is absent? We know N is not in the word. So ""corns"" has N at position 4? Position 4 is E? No, in ""corns"" it's C O R N S, so position 4 is N, which is absent. So invalid.

""corps"": C O R P S -> this fits: C at1, O at2, R at3, P at4, S at5? But we need position 4 to be E. In ""corps"", position 4 is P? And position 5 is S? But we have E at position 4? No, the pattern requires E at position 4. So ""corps"" has no E? But we know E is in the word at position 4. So ""corps"" cannot be because it doesn't have E at position 4? Actually, ""corps"" is pronounced ""core"", but spelled C-O-R-P-S, and it has no E. But we know the word must have E at position 4. So ""corps"" is invalid.

Therefore, the only common word I can think of is ""cores"".

Another one: ""cokes"" doesn't have R.

""cotes"": C O T E S -> position 3 is T, not R.

No.

""cares"" has A.

So I think ""cores"" is the best.

But let's double-check the feedback.

We know the word has E at position 4, so in ""cores"", E is at position 4? Let's index: 
Position 1: C
Position 2: O
Position 3: R
Position 4: E? No, in ""cores"", it's C-O-R-E-S, so:
1: C
2: O
3: R
4: E
5: S

Yes, that matches: position 3 is R, position 4 is E.

Perfect.

So we'll guess ""cores"".

If it's not, we get feedback on O and S.

But since we have limited tries, we should guess.

So the next guess is ""cores"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - A and N are not in the word.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

- **Guess 2: ""cured""** → Feedback: C(✓) U(x) R(✓) E(✓) D(x)  
  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed).
  - U is not in the word.
  - R is correct and in position 3.
  - E is correct and in position 4.
  - D is not in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **C**, has **R** in position 3, and **E** in position 4. The pattern is: **C _ R E _**.
- The missing letters are in positions 2 and 5.
- Excluded letters: **A**, **N**, **U**, and **D** (all marked ""x"" in feedback).
- The word must include **R** and **E** (known from Guess 1), but their positions are now confirmed (R at 3, E at 4).
- No duplicates are indicated in feedback, so we assume the word has only one **E** (since E is fixed at position 4, it cannot be in position 2).

### Strategy for the next guess:
- We need a 5-letter word fitting **C _ R E _**.
- Position 2 must be a letter not excluded (not A, N, U, D) and not E (to avoid duplicates).
- Position 5 must be a letter not excluded.
- To maximize information, choose a common word with new letters to test possible solutions.
- The word **""cores""** fits perfectly:
  - **C** (position 1, correct).
  - **O** (position 2, new letter to test).
  - **R** (position 3, correct).
  - **E** (position 4, correct).
  - **S** (position 5, new letter to test).
- **O** and **S** are common letters not yet tested, and this guess avoids all excluded letters.

If ""cores"" is correct, we win. If not, the feedback on **O** and **S** will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., words like ""coves"" or ""cokes"" are invalid due to the pattern, leaving few alternatives like ""cires"" or ""cotes"", but ""cores"" is the most common fit).

<guess>cores</guess>",cores,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position) → so the first letter is C.
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R is in the word, but not at position 2.
- A: x (not in word) → A is absent.
- N: x (not in word) → N is absent.
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word, but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""cured""
- C: ✓ (correct position) → confirmed first letter C.
- U: x (not in word) → U is absent.
- R: ✓ (correct position) → R is at position 3.
- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is at position 4.
- D: x (not in word) → D is absent.

So now we know:
- The word starts with C, has R at position 3, and E at position 4. So the pattern is: C _ R E _
- We also know that the missing letters are the second and fifth positions.
- We know that A, N, U, and D are not in the word.

From the first guess, we also know that E is not at position 5 (which is consistent with the pattern above, since E is at 4) and R is not at position 2 (which is consistent because R is at 3).

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word of the form: C _ R E _

The second letter is unknown, and the fifth letter is unknown.

We also know that the word contains no A, N, U, or D.

We must avoid using these letters.

We have used the letters: C, R, E, and from the first guess we also used A, N (which are out) and from the second guess U and D (out). So we have used: C, R, E, A, N, U, D.

Available letters: all others.

We need to fill the second and fifth positions.

Common letters that could fit:

For the second position: it can be a vowel or consonant. Common vowels left: O, I, and sometimes Y? But let's see.

For the fifth position: any letter except the ones we know are absent.

We can try to think of words that fit: C _ R E _

Examples: 
- corey? Not a word.
- core? Only 4 letters.
- We need 5 letters.

Common words: 
- ""corey"" is not standard. 
- ""covey"" -> C O V E Y? That's 5 letters. But we don't know about V and Y.
- ""copse"" -> C O P S E? But E is at position 5? But in our pattern, E is at position 4, so the fifth is something else. ""copse"" has E at the end? Actually, ""copse"" is C O P S E -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:P, 4:S, 5:E. But we need position 3 to be R and position 4 to be E. So that doesn't match.

We need the third letter to be R and fourth to be E. So the word must be: [C] [letter2] [R] [E] [letter5]

So the pattern is fixed for positions 1,3,4.

Possible words:
- ""cares"" -> but A is forbidden, and also E is at position 4? ""cares"": C A R E S -> but A is not allowed.
- ""cores"": C O R E S -> this fits: C at1, O at2, R at3, E at4, S at5. And O and S are not forbidden? We haven't used O or S, and they are not in the absent list (A, N, U, D). So ""cores"" is a possibility.
- ""cokes"": C O K E S -> but position 3 is K, not R. Doesn't fit.
- ""cries"": C R I E S -> but position 2 is R? We know R is at position 3, so position 2 cannot be R. Also, in ""cries"", R is at position 2, which we know is wrong because from the first guess R was misplaced at position 2. So R cannot be at position 2. Therefore, ""cries"" is invalid because it forces R at position 2.

Similarly, ""crates"": too long? 6 letters? No, 6? ""crates"" is 6? C-R-A-T-E-S, 6 letters. We need 5.

Another word: ""creek"": C R E E K -> but position 2 is R? Again, R at position 2 is forbidden. Also, E at position 3? But we need R at position 3 and E at position 4. So no.

""creep"": same issue, R at position 2.

So back to ""cores"": C O R E S -> this seems to fit the pattern.

Other possibilities:
- ""cored"": but we used D in the second guess and D is absent? Feedback for ""cured"" had D(x), so D is not in the word. ""cored"" has D at the end? ""cored"" is C O R E D -> but D is absent, so it cannot be. We know D is not in the word.

Similarly, ""coves"": C O V E S -> but position 3 is V, not R. Doesn't fit.

""cores"" is one option.

Another: ""cires""? Not common.

""cares"" has A.

""ceres"": C E R E S -> but position 2 is E? We don't know if E can be at position 2? But we have E at position 4, and we don't know about duplicates.

Therefore, ""ceres"" would have E at position 2 and 4? That might be possible, but let's avoid for now.

Another word: ""cries"" we already saw has R at position 2, which is invalid.

""crones"": has N? N is absent.

""cares"": A absent.

So ""cores"" seems a strong candidate: C O R E S.

We also have ""coves"", but position 3 is V, not R.

""cores"" is the word.

But we need to confirm if ""cores"" is a valid word. Yes, it is (a plural of core, or a type of fruit? But in Wordle, it's accepted).

Another possibility: ""cukes""? C U K E S -> but U is absent, and position 3 is K, not R.

No.

""cures"": C U R E S -> but U is absent? We know U is not in the word from the second guess feedback. So ""cures"" has U at position 2, which is absent. So invalid.

Therefore, ""cores"" is a good guess because:
- It fits the pattern: C at1, O at2, R at3, E at4, S at5.
- It uses O and S, which are new and not excluded.
- It doesn't use any forbidden letters (A, N, U, D).

If ""cores"" is the secret word, we win. If not, we get feedback on O and S.

But we have only 6 tries, and this is the third guess.

We could also consider other words like ""bares"", but doesn't start with C.

Another word: ""cires""? Not common.

""cores"" seems the most straightforward.

But let's think: is there a word like ""crate""? But A is absent and it's 5 letters? ""crate"" has A and E at position 5? But we need E at position 4.

No.

""crete""? Not a word? Or proper noun.

I think ""cores"" is a good guess.

But we have to consider that the fifth letter might be something else.

Another common word: ""creek"" but doesn't fit.

""crepe"" has E at position 5? Forbidden.

So I'll go with ""cores"".

But in the pattern, we have C _ R E _, and we are guessing O for position 2 and S for position 5.

We could guess a word that tests more letters? But we have to fill the positions.

Since we know three letters, we can try to guess the entire word.

But we have two unknowns, so we need to test.

Another word: ""corns""? C O R N S -> but N is absent? We know N is not in the word. So ""corns"" has N at position 4? Position 4 is E? No, in ""corns"" it's C O R N S, so position 4 is N, which is absent. So invalid.

""corps"": C O R P S -> this fits: C at1, O at2, R at3, P at4, S at5? But we need position 4 to be E. In ""corps"", position 4 is P? And position 5 is S? But we have E at position 4? No, the pattern requires E at position 4. So ""corps"" has no E? But we know E is in the word at position 4. So ""corps"" cannot be because it doesn't have E at position 4? Actually, ""corps"" is pronounced ""core"", but spelled C-O-R-P-S, and it has no E. But we know the word must have E at position 4. So ""corps"" is invalid.

Therefore, the only common word I can think of is ""cores"".

Another one: ""cokes"" doesn't have R.

""cotes"": C O T E S -> position 3 is T, not R.

No.

""cares"" has A.

So I think ""cores"" is the best.

But let's double-check the feedback.

We know the word has E at position 4, so in ""cores"", E is at position 4? Let's index: 
Position 1: C
Position 2: O
Position 3: R
Position 4: E? No, in ""cores"", it's C-O-R-E-S, so:
1: C
2: O
3: R
4: E
5: S

Yes, that matches: position 3 is R, position 4 is E.

Perfect.

So we'll guess ""cores"".

If it's not, we get feedback on O and S.

But since we have limited tries, we should guess.

So the next guess is ""cores"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - A and N are not in the word.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

- **Guess 2: ""cured""** → Feedback: C(✓) U(x) R(✓) E(✓) D(x)  
  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed).
  - U is not in the word.
  - R is correct and in position 3.
  - E is correct and in position 4.
  - D is not in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **C**, has **R** in position 3, and **E** in position 4. The pattern is: **C _ R E _**.
- The missing letters are in positions 2 and 5.
- Excluded letters: **A**, **N**, **U**, and **D** (all marked ""x"" in feedback).
- The word must include **R** and **E** (known from Guess 1), but their positions are now confirmed (R at 3, E at 4).
- No duplicates are indicated in feedback, so we assume the word has only one **E** (since E is fixed at position 4, it cannot be in position 2).

### Strategy for the next guess:
- We need a 5-letter word fitting **C _ R E _**.
- Position 2 must be a letter not excluded (not A, N, U, D) and not E (to avoid duplicates).
- Position 5 must be a letter not excluded.
- To maximize information, choose a common word with new letters to test possible solutions.
- The word **""cores""** fits perfectly:
  - **C** (position 1, correct).
  - **O** (position 2, new letter to test).
  - **R** (position 3, correct).
  - **E** (position 4, correct).
  - **S** (position 5, new letter to test).
- **O** and **S** are common letters not yet tested, and this guess avoids all excluded letters.

If ""cores"" is correct, we win. If not, the feedback on **O** and **S** will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., words like ""coves"" or ""cokes"" are invalid due to the pattern, leaving few alternatives like ""cires"" or ""cotes"", but ""cores"" is the most common fit).",Guess 3: cores -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,corer,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E' — which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Interpretation:
1. The letter 'C' is in the secret word and it is the first letter because it's marked correct.
   - So, the secret word starts with C.
2. The letter 'R' is in the secret word but not in the second position (since it was in the second position in our guess but feedback says wrong position).
3. 'A' is not in the secret word at all.
4. 'N' is not in the secret word at all.
5. 'E' is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (it was in the fifth position in our guess).

Therefore, we know:
- The word starts with 'C'.
- The word contains 'R' and 'E', but neither is in the position we guessed.
- The word does not contain 'A' or 'N'.

We must avoid using 'A' and 'N' in future guesses.

Now, let's think about positions:
- Since 'C' is fixed at position 1, we have: C _ _ _ _
- 'R' is in the word but not at position 2. So it must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5.
- 'E' is in the word but not at position 5. So it must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Starts with 'C'
- Includes 'R' and 'E' (but not in the positions we already know are wrong: R not at 2, E not at 5)
- Excludes 'A' and 'N'
- And we can use other letters, preferably common ones.

We also want to test possible positions for R and E.

Let's consider words that start with C and contain R and E.

We know that E cannot be at position 5, and R cannot be at position 2.

Possible words? We don't know the word, but we can try a word that fits these constraints and uses new letters to get more information.

Example: Try a word like ""CREPT"", but note that we have E at position 3, and R at position 2. But we know R cannot be at position 2. So ""CREPT"" puts R at position 2 which is forbidden.

We need R somewhere else. How about ""CRWTH""? That's too obscure.

Let's think of common words: 
- We could do ""CRESS"" but note that E is at position 3 and S is repeated? We don't know if repeats are allowed? The rules say 5-letter English word, but doesn't specify unique letters. However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. But since our feedback for ""crane"" didn't show repeated, we don't know.

But we don't have any repeated letters in the first guess, so we can't rule them out.

However, to maximize information, we can try a word with distinct letters we haven't tried.

Letters we have tried: C, R, A, N, E. We know A and N are absent. So available letters: all others.

We need to include R and E in the new word, but not in the positions we know they are not.

So let's consider:
- Position 2: cannot be R, and we don't know what it is. We can try another vowel? But A is out. So vowels: E (but E might be elsewhere), O, I, U? Or consonant?

We know E is in the word but not at position 5. So E must be at 2,3, or4? But we don't know.

We also must place R at 3,4, or5? Because it can't be at 2.

Now, since the first letter is C, let's find words of the form: C _ _ _ _

We can try putting R at position 3 and E at position 4? For example, ""CURED""? But what about U?

Alternatively, to test E at position 2: that would be ""CE___"". But we don't know if that's valid.

Some possibilities: 
- ""CREME"" -> but E at position 4 and 5? And we know E cannot be at position 5. Also, we haven't tested M.

We don't want to use E at position 5 because we know it's not there.

So maybe we can try E at position 2? Then the word is ""CE___"". For example, ""CERT""? No, it's 5 letters? 

""CEILS"" -> but that has L and S. Or ""CELEB""? Not a word.

Common words: 
- ""CREST"": 
  - C at 1 (good)
  - R at 2? But we know R is not at position 2. So if we use ""CREST"", R is at position 2, which we know is wrong. That would be wasting a guess.

We need to avoid putting R at position 2.

How about ""CODER""? 
- C at 1 (good)
- O at 2 (new, and a vowel)
- D at 3 (new)
- E at 4 (and note, we put E at position 4, which is allowed because we only know it's not at 5)
- R at 5? We previously had R at position 2 and now at 5? We also have E at position 4.

But we must check if we avoid A and N: yes.

But maybe we can do better? Because we want to test positions.

Another idea: since R must be in position 3,4, or 5, and E must be in 2,3, or4, we can design a guess that might clarify more.

What about ""CLEAR""? But we avoid A because A is not in the word! So we cannot use A.

So ""CLEAR"" is invalid because A is forbidden.

Similarly, ""CURED"": 
- C at1, U at2, R at3, E at4, D at5.
This avoids A and N and has E at position 4 (not 5) and R at position 3 (not 2). So that's acceptable.
We also get to test U, D and confirm E and R.

We haven't tested U and D yet.

Alternatively, we could test other common consonants.

But let's think about what we need to discover: we need to know the positions of R and E and the two other letters.

Another good option: ""CRUEL"". 
- C at1
- R at2: oh, but that is the position we know is wrong for R. So that's not allowed? In the feedback, R was marked as in the word but wrong position when at position 2. So putting R at position 2 again would be wrong. In fact, it's known to be incorrect so we shouldn't do that.

Hence, we must choose a word where R is not at position 2.

Therefore, ""CRUEL"" is invalid because R is at 2.

How about ""CREPT"": same issue, R at position 2.

We need a word without R at position 2.

Let me list some words: 
- ""CABLE"" -> but we cannot use A. So no.
- ""CEDAR"" -> contains A, forbidden.
- ""CREDE"" -> not a common word?
- ""CREPE"" -> E at position 5? But E cannot be at position 5. Also, R at position 2 which is forbidden.

So we need R in positions 3,4, or5.

What common words start with C and have R at position 3? 
- E.g. ""CAROM"" -> but A is in it. Forbidden.
- ""CURSE"": C at1, U at2, R at3, S at4, E at5 -> but E at position 5? We know E cannot be at position 5. So that's invalid.

Similarly, ""CORSE"": O at2, R at3, S at4, E at5: E at5, which is forbidden.

Therefore, we cannot have E at position 5.

So we need E at positions 2,3, or4.

And R at positions 3,4, or5.

But also, R cannot be at the same position as E? Not necessarily.

Possible structure:
- If we put E at position 2: then the word is C E _ _ _
  - Then R must be in positions 3,4,5: so like ""C E R _ _"" or ""C E _ R _"" or ""C E _ _ R""

Examples: 
- ""CEROS"" -> a word? Plural of zero? Not sure.
- ""CERYL""? Probably not.

More common: ""CEFR""? No.

Alternatively, ""CEASE"" -> has A. Forbidden.

How about putting E at position 4: then word structure C _ _ E _

And R at position 5? Then ""C _ _ E R""

Or R at position 3: ""C _ R E _""

Examples:
- ""C U R E D"": as I thought earlier -> but is it a word? Yes, ""cured"".

Other options: ""CITED"" -> doesn't have R? We must include R because we know it's in the word.

We must include R and E.

Another word: ""CORED"": C O R E D
- C at1: good.
- O at2: new.
- R at3: but we originally had R at position 2 and know it's not there. Position 3 is new. We hope this might be right? Possible.
- E at4: we know E is in the word and not at5, and here it's at position 4. Possible.
- D at5: new.

Also, avoids A and N. So ""cored"" is a valid word.

Similarly, another candidate: ""CRONE"" -> but contains N? Not allowed because N is not in the word? We know N is absent. Oh, feedback said N(x), so we cannot use N.

""CRONE"" has N? Oh, ""CRONE"": C R O N E -> N at position 4? But we know N is absent. So that's invalid.

Similarly, ""CROME""? Not a word.

Another one: ""CIRES"" -> C I R E S: 
- E is at position 4? Then R at 3? 
- Avoids A and N.

But we could do ""cores"" -> but that's 5 letters? ""cores"": C O R E S -> E at position 4? But we know E cannot be at position 4? Actually, no, we don't know. We know it's not at position 5. It could be at 4. But in ""cores"", E at4 and it is a word. But also, R at position 2? We know that is forbidden. Because in ""crane"", R at2 was marked as wrong position. So putting R at position 2 again? We shouldn't waste it.

Therefore, we must choose a word without R at position 2 and without E at position 5, and without A and N.

So back to ""cored"": C O R E D
- R is at position 3? That's safe because we don't know about position 3.
- E at position 4? Also safe.

And we haven't used O or D.

Another possibility: ""coled""? Not a common word.

""coved"": C O V E D -> similar.

But not as common as ""cored"".

Alternatively, ""cried"": C R I E D -> but R at position 2? Forbidden.

So ""cored"" seems reasonable.

Another one: ""creme"" -> but E at position 5? We know position 5 cannot be E.

And ""creed"" -> E at5? Forbidden.

""crews"" -> R at position 2? Forbidden.

So ""cored"" might be a good choice.

But note: we have feedback from previous that E is not at position 5, but we don't know about position 4. Similarly, R is not at position 2.

Also, in ""cored"", we have R at position 3 and E at position 4.

If in the secret word, R is supposed to be at position 3 and E at position 4, we could get lucky.

Alternatively, if not, we will get new feedback.

We also test O and D.

But what about the letter E not being at position 5? Yes, in ""cored"", E is not at 5.

We can also consider ""cured"": C U R E D -> similar, but with U instead of O.

Both are valid.

Let's choose one. It doesn't matter much.

I'll go with ""cured"" because it tests U.

We haven't tested U.

So guess: CURED

Breakdown:
- C: should be ✓ because we know first letter is C? Actually, we know C is at position 1 and correct. So in CURED, C at1 should be correct.
- U: we don't know? We'll get feedback.
- R: we know R is in the word but not at position 2. Here it's at position 3 -> could be correct or misplaced? We don't know yet.
- E: at position 4, we know E is in the word and not at5, so position 4 might be correct or misplaced.
- D: unknown.

This gives us information about these positions.

Alternatively, ""cored"" uses O, which is a vowel.

I think both are acceptable.

Since R was misplaced at position 2 and E at position 5, shifting them to adjacent positions might help.

Let's lock in ""cured"".

So second guess: CURED

Response format: <guess>cured</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- The word starts with C (position 1).
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- A and N are not in the word.

Therefore:
– My next guess must start with C.
– It must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
– It cannot contain A or N.

To maximize new information, I'll choose a word that tests common letters not yet tried. ""CURED"" fits:
- Starts with C (position 1).
- Puts R at position 3 (avoiding position 2).
- Puts E at position 4 (avoiding position 5).
- Introduces U and D, which haven't been tested.
- Excludes A and N.

This helps narrow down the positions of R and E while testing two new letters.

<guess>cured</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: cured -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(x) R(✓) E(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position) → so the first letter is C.
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R is in the word, but not at position 2.
- A: x (not in word) → A is absent.
- N: x (not in word) → N is absent.
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word, but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""cured""
- C: ✓ (correct position) → confirmed first letter C.
- U: x (not in word) → U is absent.
- R: ✓ (correct position) → R is at position 3.
- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is at position 4.
- D: x (not in word) → D is absent.

So now we know:
- The word starts with C, has R at position 3, and E at position 4. So the pattern is: C _ R E _
- We also know that the missing letters are the second and fifth positions.
- We know that A, N, U, and D are not in the word.

From the first guess, we also know that E is not at position 5 (which is consistent with the pattern above, since E is at 4) and R is not at position 2 (which is consistent because R is at 3).

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word of the form: C _ R E _

The second letter is unknown, and the fifth letter is unknown.

We also know that the word contains no A, N, U, or D.

We must avoid using these letters.

We have used the letters: C, R, E, and from the first guess we also used A, N (which are out) and from the second guess U and D (out). So we have used: C, R, E, A, N, U, D.

Available letters: all others.

We need to fill the second and fifth positions.

Common letters that could fit:

For the second position: it can be a vowel or consonant. Common vowels left: O, I, and sometimes Y? But let's see.

For the fifth position: any letter except the ones we know are absent.

We can try to think of words that fit: C _ R E _

Examples: 
- corey? Not a word.
- core? Only 4 letters.
- We need 5 letters.

Common words: 
- ""corey"" is not standard. 
- ""covey"" -> C O V E Y? That's 5 letters. But we don't know about V and Y.
- ""copse"" -> C O P S E? But E is at position 5? But in our pattern, E is at position 4, so the fifth is something else. ""copse"" has E at the end? Actually, ""copse"" is C O P S E -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:P, 4:S, 5:E. But we need position 3 to be R and position 4 to be E. So that doesn't match.

We need the third letter to be R and fourth to be E. So the word must be: [C] [letter2] [R] [E] [letter5]

So the pattern is fixed for positions 1,3,4.

Possible words:
- ""cares"" -> but A is forbidden, and also E is at position 4? ""cares"": C A R E S -> but A is not allowed.
- ""cores"": C O R E S -> this fits: C at1, O at2, R at3, E at4, S at5. And O and S are not forbidden? We haven't used O or S, and they are not in the absent list (A, N, U, D). So ""cores"" is a possibility.
- ""cokes"": C O K E S -> but position 3 is K, not R. Doesn't fit.
- ""cries"": C R I E S -> but position 2 is R? We know R is at position 3, so position 2 cannot be R. Also, in ""cries"", R is at position 2, which we know is wrong because from the first guess R was misplaced at position 2. So R cannot be at position 2. Therefore, ""cries"" is invalid because it forces R at position 2.

Similarly, ""crates"": too long? 6 letters? No, 6? ""crates"" is 6? C-R-A-T-E-S, 6 letters. We need 5.

Another word: ""creek"": C R E E K -> but position 2 is R? Again, R at position 2 is forbidden. Also, E at position 3? But we need R at position 3 and E at position 4. So no.

""creep"": same issue, R at position 2.

So back to ""cores"": C O R E S -> this seems to fit the pattern.

Other possibilities:
- ""cored"": but we used D in the second guess and D is absent? Feedback for ""cured"" had D(x), so D is not in the word. ""cored"" has D at the end? ""cored"" is C O R E D -> but D is absent, so it cannot be. We know D is not in the word.

Similarly, ""coves"": C O V E S -> but position 3 is V, not R. Doesn't fit.

""cores"" is one option.

Another: ""cires""? Not common.

""cares"" has A.

""ceres"": C E R E S -> but position 2 is E? We don't know if E can be at position 2? But we have E at position 4, and we don't know about duplicates. The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but it might be possible? However, in the first guess, E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position. Now we have E at position 4. If the word has only one E, then E cannot be at position 2. But we don't know if there are two E's? The feedback doesn't indicate duplicates explicitly. For example, if a letter appears twice, the feedback might show multiple marks. But in ""crane"", we had one E and it was marked as present. In ""cured"", we had one E and it was correct at position 4. So if the secret word has only one E, then we cannot have E at position 2. But we don't know.

To be safe, let's assume that the word has only one E for now, because we haven't seen evidence of duplicates. So E is at position 4, so it cannot be at position 2.

Therefore, ""ceres"" would have E at position 2 and 4? That might be possible, but let's avoid for now.

Another word: ""cries"" we already saw has R at position 2, which is invalid.

""crones"": has N? N is absent.

""cares"": A absent.

So ""cores"" seems a strong candidate: C O R E S.

We also have ""coves"", but position 3 is V, not R.

""cores"" is the word.

But we need to confirm if ""cores"" is a valid word. Yes, it is (a plural of core, or a type of fruit? But in Wordle, it's accepted).

Another possibility: ""cukes""? C U K E S -> but U is absent, and position 3 is K, not R.

No.

""cures"": C U R E S -> but U is absent? We know U is not in the word from the second guess feedback. So ""cures"" has U at position 2, which is absent. So invalid.

Therefore, ""cores"" is a good guess because:
- It fits the pattern: C at1, O at2, R at3, E at4, S at5.
- It uses O and S, which are new and not excluded.
- It doesn't use any forbidden letters (A, N, U, D).

If ""cores"" is the secret word, we win. If not, we get feedback on O and S.

But we have only 6 tries, and this is the third guess.

We could also consider other words like ""bares"", but doesn't start with C.

Another word: ""cires""? Not common.

""cores"" seems the most straightforward.

But let's think: is there a word like ""crate""? But A is absent and it's 5 letters? ""crate"" has A and E at position 5? But we need E at position 4.

No.

""crete""? Not a word? Or proper noun.

I think ""cores"" is a good guess.

But we have to consider that the fifth letter might be something else.

Another common word: ""creek"" but doesn't fit.

""crepe"" has E at position 5? Forbidden.

So I'll go with ""cores"".

But in the pattern, we have C _ R E _, and we are guessing O for position 2 and S for position 5.

We could guess a word that tests more letters? But we have to fill the positions.

Since we know three letters, we can try to guess the entire word.

But we have two unknowns, so we need to test.

Another word: ""corns""? C O R N S -> but N is absent? We know N is not in the word. So ""corns"" has N at position 4? Position 4 is E? No, in ""corns"" it's C O R N S, so position 4 is N, which is absent. So invalid.

""corps"": C O R P S -> this fits: C at1, O at2, R at3, P at4, S at5? But we need position 4 to be E. In ""corps"", position 4 is P? And position 5 is S? But we have E at position 4? No, the pattern requires E at position 4. So ""corps"" has no E? But we know E is in the word at position 4. So ""corps"" cannot be because it doesn't have E at position 4? Actually, ""corps"" is pronounced ""core"", but spelled C-O-R-P-S, and it has no E. But we know the word must have E at position 4. So ""corps"" is invalid.

Therefore, the only common word I can think of is ""cores"".

Another one: ""cokes"" doesn't have R.

""cotes"": C O T E S -> position 3 is T, not R.

No.

""cares"" has A.

So I think ""cores"" is the best.

But let's double-check the feedback.

We know the word has E at position 4, so in ""cores"", E is at position 4? Let's index: 
Position 1: C
Position 2: O
Position 3: R
Position 4: E? No, in ""cores"", it's C-O-R-E-S, so:
1: C
2: O
3: R
4: E
5: S

Yes, that matches: position 3 is R, position 4 is E.

Perfect.

So we'll guess ""cores"".

If it's not, we get feedback on O and S.

But since we have limited tries, we should guess.

So the next guess is ""cores"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  - C is correct and in position 1.
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - A and N are not in the word.
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

- **Guess 2: ""cured""** → Feedback: C(✓) U(x) R(✓) E(✓) D(x)  
  - C is correct and in position 1 (confirmed).
  - U is not in the word.
  - R is correct and in position 3.
  - E is correct and in position 4.
  - D is not in the word.

### Deductions:
- The secret word starts with **C**, has **R** in position 3, and **E** in position 4. The pattern is: **C _ R E _**.
- The missing letters are in positions 2 and 5.
- Excluded letters: **A**, **N**, **U**, and **D** (all marked ""x"" in feedback).
- The word must include **R** and **E** (known from Guess 1), but their positions are now confirmed (R at 3, E at 4).
- No duplicates are indicated in feedback, so we assume the word has only one **E** (since E is fixed at position 4, it cannot be in position 2).

### Strategy for the next guess:
- We need a 5-letter word fitting **C _ R E _**.
- Position 2 must be a letter not excluded (not A, N, U, D) and not E (to avoid duplicates).
- Position 5 must be a letter not excluded.
- To maximize information, choose a common word with new letters to test possible solutions.
- The word **""cores""** fits perfectly:
  - **C** (position 1, correct).
  - **O** (position 2, new letter to test).
  - **R** (position 3, correct).
  - **E** (position 4, correct).
  - **S** (position 5, new letter to test).
- **O** and **S** are common letters not yet tested, and this guess avoids all excluded letters.

If ""cores"" is correct, we win. If not, the feedback on **O** and **S** will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., words like ""coves"" or ""cokes"" are invalid due to the pattern, leaving few alternatives like ""cires"" or ""cotes"", but ""cores"" is the most common fit).

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because it has \'C\', \'R\', \'A\', \'N\', \'E\' — which are common letters.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C: ✓ (correct position)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nInterpretation:\n1. The letter \'C\' is in the secret word and it is the first letter because it\'s marked correct.\n   - So, the secret word starts with C.\n2. The letter \'R\' is in the secret word but not in the second position (since it was in the second position in our guess but feedback says wrong position).\n3. \'A\' is not in the secret word at all.\n4. \'N\' is not in the secret word at all.\n5. \'E\' is in the secret word but not in the fifth position (it was in the fifth position in our guess).\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The word starts with \'C\'.\n- The word contains \'R\' and \'E\', but neither is in the position we guessed.\n- The word does not contain \'A\' or \'N\'.\n\nWe must avoid using \'A\' and \'N\' in future guesses.\n\nNow, let\'s think about positions:\n- Since \'C\' is fixed at position 1, we have: C _ _ _ _\n- \'R\' is in the word but not at position 2. So it must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5.\n- \'E\' is in the word but not at position 5. So it must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe need to make a second guess that:\n- Starts with \'C\'\n- Includes \'R\' and \'E\' (but not in the positions we already know are wrong: R not at 2, E not at 5)\n- Excludes \'A\' and \'N\'\n- And we can use other letters, preferably common ones.\n\nWe also want to test possible positions for R and E.\n\nLet\'s consider words that start with C and contain R and E.\n\nWe know that E cannot be at position 5, and R cannot be at position 2.\n\nPossible words? We don\'t know the word, but we can try a word that fits these constraints and uses new letters to get more information.\n\nExample: Try a word like ""CREPT"", but note that we have E at position 3, and R at position 2. But we know R cannot be at position 2. So ""CREPT"" puts R at position 2 which is forbidden.\n\nWe need R somewhere else. How about ""CRWTH""? That\'s too obscure.\n\nLet\'s think of common words: \n- We could do ""CRESS"" but note that E is at position 3 and S is repeated? We don\'t know if repeats are allowed? The rules say 5-letter English word, but doesn\'t specify unique letters. However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters. But since our feedback for ""crane"" didn\'t show repeated, we don\'t know.\n\nBut we don\'t have any repeated letters in the first guess, so we can\'t rule them out.\n\nHowever, to maximize information, we can try a word with distinct letters we haven\'t tried.\n\nLetters we have tried: C, R, A, N, E. We know A and N are absent. So available letters: all others.\n\nWe need to include R and E in the new word, but not in the positions we know they are not.\n\nSo let\'s consider:\n- Position 2: cannot be R, and we don\'t know what it is. We can try another vowel? But A is out. So vowels: E (but E might be elsewhere), O, I, U? Or consonant?\n\nWe know E is in the word but not at position 5. So E must be at 2,3, or4? But we don\'t know.\n\nWe also must place R at 3,4, or5? Because it can\'t be at 2.\n\nNow, since the first letter is C, let\'s find words of the form: C _ _ _ _\n\nWe can try putting R at position 3 and E at position 4? For example, ""CURED""? But what about U?\n\nAlternatively, to test E at position 2: that would be ""CE___"". But we don\'t know if that\'s valid.\n\nSome possibilities: \n- ""CREME"" -> but E at position 4 and 5? And we know E cannot be at position 5. Also, we haven\'t tested M.\n\nWe don\'t want to use E at position 5 because we know it\'s not there.\n\nSo maybe we can try E at position 2? Then the word is ""CE___"". For example, ""CERT""? No, it\'s 5 letters? \n\n""CEILS"" -> but that has L and S. Or ""CELEB""? Not a word.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""CREST"": \n  - C at 1 (good)\n  - R at 2? But we know R is not at position 2. So if we use ""CREST"", R is at position 2, which we know is wrong. That would be wasting a guess.\n\nWe need to avoid putting R at position 2.\n\nHow about ""CODER""? \n- C at 1 (good)\n- O at 2 (new, and a vowel)\n- D at 3 (new)\n- E at 4 (and note, we put E at position 4, which is allowed because we only know it\'s not at 5)\n- R at 5? We previously had R at position 2 and now at 5? We also have E at position 4.\n\nBut we must check if we avoid A and N: yes.\n\nBut maybe we can do better? Because we want to test positions.\n\nAnother idea: since R must be in position 3,4, or 5, and E must be in 2,3, or4, we can design a guess that might clarify more.\n\nWhat about ""CLEAR""? But we avoid A because A is not in the word! So we cannot use A.\n\nSo ""CLEAR"" is invalid because A is forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, ""CURED"": \n- C at1, U at2, R at3, E at4, D at5.\nThis avoids A and N and has E at position 4 (not 5) and R at position 3 (not 2). So that\'s acceptable.\nWe also get to test U, D and confirm E and R.\n\nWe haven\'t tested U and D yet.\n\nAlternatively, we could test other common consonants.\n\nBut let\'s think about what we need to discover: we need to know the positions of R and E and the two other letters.\n\nAnother good option: ""CRUEL"". \n- C at1\n- R at2: oh, but that is the position we know is wrong for R. So that\'s not allowed? In the feedback, R was marked as in the word but wrong position when at position 2. So putting R at position 2 again would be wrong. In fact, it\'s known to be incorrect so we shouldn\'t do that.\n\nHence, we must choose a word where R is not at position 2.\n\nTherefore, ""CRUEL"" is invalid because R is at 2.\n\nHow about ""CREPT"": same issue, R at position 2.\n\nWe need a word without R at position 2.\n\nLet me list some words: \n- ""CABLE"" -> but we cannot use A. So no.\n- ""CEDAR"" -> contains A, forbidden.\n- ""CREDE"" -> not a common word?\n- ""CREPE"" -> E at position 5? But E cannot be at position 5. Also, R at position 2 which is forbidden.\n\nSo we need R in positions 3,4, or5.\n\nWhat common words start with C and have R at position 3? \n- E.g. ""CAROM"" -> but A is in it. Forbidden.\n- ""CURSE"": C at1, U at2, R at3, S at4, E at5 -> but E at position 5? We know E cannot be at position 5. So that\'s invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""CORSE"": O at2, R at3, S at4, E at5: E at5, which is forbidden.\n\nTherefore, we cannot have E at position 5.\n\nSo we need E at positions 2,3, or4.\n\nAnd R at positions 3,4, or5.\n\nBut also, R cannot be at the same position as E? Not necessarily.\n\nPossible structure:\n- If we put E at position 2: then the word is C E _ _ _\n  - Then R must be in positions 3,4,5: so like ""C E R _ _"" or ""C E _ R _"" or ""C E _ _ R""\n\nExamples: \n- ""CEROS"" -> a word? Plural of zero? Not sure.\n- ""CERYL""? Probably not.\n\nMore common: ""CEFR""? No.\n\nAlternatively, ""CEASE"" -> has A. Forbidden.\n\nHow about putting E at position 4: then word structure C _ _ E _\n\nAnd R at position 5? Then ""C _ _ E R""\n\nOr R at position 3: ""C _ R E _""\n\nExamples:\n- ""C U R E D"": as I thought earlier -> but is it a word? Yes, ""cured"".\n\nOther options: ""CITED"" -> doesn\'t have R? We must include R because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nWe must include R and E.\n\nAnother word: ""CORED"": C O R E D\n- C at1: good.\n- O at2: new.\n- R at3: but we originally had R at position 2 and know it\'s not there. Position 3 is new. We hope this might be right? Possible.\n- E at4: we know E is in the word and not at5, and here it\'s at position 4. Possible.\n- D at5: new.\n\nAlso, avoids A and N. So ""cored"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, another candidate: ""CRONE"" -> but contains N? Not allowed because N is not in the word? We know N is absent. Oh, feedback said N(x), so we cannot use N.\n\n""CRONE"" has N? Oh, ""CRONE"": C R O N E -> N at position 4? But we know N is absent. So that\'s invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""CROME""? Not a word.\n\nAnother one: ""CIRES"" -> C I R E S: \n- E is at position 4? Then R at 3? \n- Avoids A and N.\n\nBut we could do ""cores"" -> but that\'s 5 letters? ""cores"": C O R E S -> E at position 4? But we know E cannot be at position 4? Actually, no, we don\'t know. We know it\'s not at position 5. It could be at 4. But in ""cores"", E at4 and it is a word. But also, R at position 2? We know that is forbidden. Because in ""crane"", R at2 was marked as wrong position. So putting R at position 2 again? We shouldn\'t waste it.\n\nTherefore, we must choose a word without R at position 2 and without E at position 5, and without A and N.\n\nSo back to ""cored"": C O R E D\n- R is at position 3? That\'s safe because we don\'t know about position 3.\n- E at position 4? Also safe.\n\nAnd we haven\'t used O or D.\n\nAnother possibility: ""coled""? Not a common word.\n\n""coved"": C O V E D -> similar.\n\nBut not as common as ""cored"".\n\nAlternatively, ""cried"": C R I E D -> but R at position 2? Forbidden.\n\nSo ""cored"" seems reasonable.\n\nAnother one: ""creme"" -> but E at position 5? We know position 5 cannot be E.\n\nAnd ""creed"" -> E at5? Forbidden.\n\n""crews"" -> R at position 2? Forbidden.\n\nSo ""cored"" might be a good choice.\n\nBut note: we have feedback from previous that E is not at position 5, but we don\'t know about position 4. Similarly, R is not at position 2.\n\nAlso, in ""cored"", we have R at position 3 and E at position 4.\n\nIf in the secret word, R is supposed to be at position 3 and E at position 4, we could get lucky.\n\nAlternatively, if not, we will get new feedback.\n\nWe also test O and D.\n\nBut what about the letter E not being at position 5? Yes, in ""cored"", E is not at 5.\n\nWe can also consider ""cured"": C U R E D -> similar, but with U instead of O.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nLet\'s choose one. It doesn\'t matter much.\n\nI\'ll go with ""cured"" because it tests U.\n\nWe haven\'t tested U.\n\nSo guess: CURED\n\nBreakdown:\n- C: should be ✓ because we know first letter is C? Actually, we know C is at position 1 and correct. So in CURED, C at1 should be correct.\n- U: we don\'t know? We\'ll get feedback.\n- R: we know R is in the word but not at position 2. Here it\'s at position 3 -> could be correct or misplaced? We don\'t know yet.\n- E: at position 4, we know E is in the word and not at5, so position 4 might be correct or misplaced.\n- D: unknown.\n\nThis gives us information about these positions.\n\nAlternatively, ""cored"" uses O, which is a vowel.\n\nI think both are acceptable.\n\nSince R was misplaced at position 2 and E at position 5, shifting them to adjacent positions might help.\n\nLet\'s lock in ""cured"".\n\nSo second guess: CURED\n\nResponse format: <guess>cured</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- The word starts with C (position 1).\n- R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n- A and N are not in the word.\n\nTherefore:\n– My next guess must start with C.\n– It must include R and E, but R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.\n– It cannot contain A or N.\n\nTo maximize new information, I\'ll choose a word that tests common letters not yet tried. ""CURED"" fits:\n- Starts with C (position 1).\n- Puts R at position 3 (avoiding position 2).\n- Puts E at position 4 (avoiding position 5).\n- Introduces U and D, which haven\'t been tested.\n- Excludes A and N.\n\nThis helps narrow down the positions of R and E while testing two new letters.\n\n<guess>cured</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: cured -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(x) R(✓) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: ✓ (correct position) → so the first letter is C.\n- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R is in the word, but not at position 2.\n- A: x (not in word) → A is absent.\n- N: x (not in word) → N is absent.\n- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word, but not at position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""cured""\n- C: ✓ (correct position) → confirmed first letter C.\n- U: x (not in word) → U is absent.\n- R: ✓ (correct position) → R is at position 3.\n- E: ✓ (correct position) → E is at position 4.\n- D: x (not in word) → D is absent.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The word starts with C, has R at position 3, and E at position 4. So the pattern is: C _ R E _\n- We also know that the missing letters are the second and fifth positions.\n- We know that A, N, U, and D are not in the word.\n\nFrom the first guess, we also know that E is not at position 5 (which is consistent with the pattern above, since E is at 4) and R is not at position 2 (which is consistent because R is at 3).\n\nNow, we need to find a 5-letter word of the form: C _ R E _\n\nThe second letter is unknown, and the fifth letter is unknown.\n\nWe also know that the word contains no A, N, U, or D.\n\nWe must avoid using these letters.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, E, and from the first guess we also used A, N (which are out) and from the second guess U and D (out). So we have used: C, R, E, A, N, U, D.\n\nAvailable letters: all others.\n\nWe need to fill the second and fifth positions.\n\nCommon letters that could fit:\n\nFor the second position: it can be a vowel or consonant. Common vowels left: O, I, and sometimes Y? But let\'s see.\n\nFor the fifth position: any letter except the ones we know are absent.\n\nWe can try to think of words that fit: C _ R E _\n\nExamples: \n- corey? Not a word.\n- core? Only 4 letters.\n- We need 5 letters.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""corey"" is not standard. \n- ""covey"" -> C O V E Y? That\'s 5 letters. But we don\'t know about V and Y.\n- ""copse"" -> C O P S E? But E is at position 5? But in our pattern, E is at position 4, so the fifth is something else. ""copse"" has E at the end? Actually, ""copse"" is C O P S E -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:P, 4:S, 5:E. But we need position 3 to be R and position 4 to be E. So that doesn\'t match.\n\nWe need the third letter to be R and fourth to be E. So the word must be: [C] [letter2] [R] [E] [letter5]\n\nSo the pattern is fixed for positions 1,3,4.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""cares"" -> but A is forbidden, and also E is at position 4? ""cares"": C A R E S -> but A is not allowed.\n- ""cores"": C O R E S -> this fits: C at1, O at2, R at3, E at4, S at5. And O and S are not forbidden? We haven\'t used O or S, and they are not in the absent list (A, N, U, D). So ""cores"" is a possibility.\n- ""cokes"": C O K E S -> but position 3 is K, not R. Doesn\'t fit.\n- ""cries"": C R I E S -> but position 2 is R? We know R is at position 3, so position 2 cannot be R. Also, in ""cries"", R is at position 2, which we know is wrong because from the first guess R was misplaced at position 2. So R cannot be at position 2. Therefore, ""cries"" is invalid because it forces R at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""crates"": too long? 6 letters? No, 6? ""crates"" is 6? C-R-A-T-E-S, 6 letters. We need 5.\n\nAnother word: ""creek"": C R E E K -> but position 2 is R? Again, R at position 2 is forbidden. Also, E at position 3? But we need R at position 3 and E at position 4. So no.\n\n""creep"": same issue, R at position 2.\n\nSo back to ""cores"": C O R E S -> this seems to fit the pattern.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- ""cored"": but we used D in the second guess and D is absent? Feedback for ""cured"" had D(x), so D is not in the word. ""cored"" has D at the end? ""cored"" is C O R E D -> but D is absent, so it cannot be. We know D is not in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""coves"": C O V E S -> but position 3 is V, not R. Doesn\'t fit.\n\n""cores"" is one option.\n\nAnother: ""cires""? Not common.\n\n""cares"" has A.\n\n""ceres"": C E R E S -> but position 2 is E? We don\'t know if E can be at position 2? But we have E at position 4, and we don\'t know about duplicates. The feedback didn\'t show any duplicate, but it might be possible? However, in the first guess, E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position. Now we have E at position 4. If the word has only one E, then E cannot be at position 2. But we don\'t know if there are two E\'s? The feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates explicitly. For example, if a letter appears twice, the feedback might show multiple marks. But in ""crane"", we had one E and it was marked as present. In ""cured"", we had one E and it was correct at position 4. So if the secret word has only one E, then we cannot have E at position 2. But we don\'t know.\n\nTo be safe, let\'s assume that the word has only one E for now, because we haven\'t seen evidence of duplicates. So E is at position 4, so it cannot be at position 2.\n\nTherefore, ""ceres"" would have E at position 2 and 4? That might be possible, but let\'s avoid for now.\n\nAnother word: ""cries"" we already saw has R at position 2, which is invalid.\n\n""crones"": has N? N is absent.\n\n""cares"": A absent.\n\nSo ""cores"" seems a strong candidate: C O R E S.\n\nWe also have ""coves"", but position 3 is V, not R.\n\n""cores"" is the word.\n\nBut we need to confirm if ""cores"" is a valid word. Yes, it is (a plural of core, or a type of fruit? But in Wordle, it\'s accepted).\n\nAnother possibility: ""cukes""? C U K E S -> but U is absent, and position 3 is K, not R.\n\nNo.\n\n""cures"": C U R E S -> but U is absent? We know U is not in the word from the second guess feedback. So ""cures"" has U at position 2, which is absent. So invalid.\n\nTherefore, ""cores"" is a good guess because:\n- It fits the pattern: C at1, O at2, R at3, E at4, S at5.\n- It uses O and S, which are new and not excluded.\n- It doesn\'t use any forbidden letters (A, N, U, D).\n\nIf ""cores"" is the secret word, we win. If not, we get feedback on O and S.\n\nBut we have only 6 tries, and this is the third guess.\n\nWe could also consider other words like ""bares"", but doesn\'t start with C.\n\nAnother word: ""cires""? Not common.\n\n""cores"" seems the most straightforward.\n\nBut let\'s think: is there a word like ""crate""? But A is absent and it\'s 5 letters? ""crate"" has A and E at position 5? But we need E at position 4.\n\nNo.\n\n""crete""? Not a word? Or proper noun.\n\nI think ""cores"" is a good guess.\n\nBut we have to consider that the fifth letter might be something else.\n\nAnother common word: ""creek"" but doesn\'t fit.\n\n""crepe"" has E at position 5? Forbidden.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""cores"".\n\nBut in the pattern, we have C _ R E _, and we are guessing O for position 2 and S for position 5.\n\nWe could guess a word that tests more letters? But we have to fill the positions.\n\nSince we know three letters, we can try to guess the entire word.\n\nBut we have two unknowns, so we need to test.\n\nAnother word: ""corns""? C O R N S -> but N is absent? We know N is not in the word. So ""corns"" has N at position 4? Position 4 is E? No, in ""corns"" it\'s C O R N S, so position 4 is N, which is absent. So invalid.\n\n""corps"": C O R P S -> this fits: C at1, O at2, R at3, P at4, S at5? But we need position 4 to be E. In ""corps"", position 4 is P? And position 5 is S? But we have E at position 4? No, the pattern requires E at position 4. So ""corps"" has no E? But we know E is in the word at position 4. So ""corps"" cannot be because it doesn\'t have E at position 4? Actually, ""corps"" is pronounced ""core"", but spelled C-O-R-P-S, and it has no E. But we know the word must have E at position 4. So ""corps"" is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only common word I can think of is ""cores"".\n\nAnother one: ""cokes"" doesn\'t have R.\n\n""cotes"": C O T E S -> position 3 is T, not R.\n\nNo.\n\n""cares"" has A.\n\nSo I think ""cores"" is the best.\n\nBut let\'s double-check the feedback.\n\nWe know the word has E at position 4, so in ""cores"", E is at position 4? Let\'s index: \nPosition 1: C\nPosition 2: O\nPosition 3: R\nPosition 4: E?

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position) → position 1 is C.
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R is in the word, but not at position 2.
- A: x (not in word) → A is absent.
- N: x (not in word) → N is absent.
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word, but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""cured""
- C: ✓ (correct position) → position 1 is C (confirmed).
- U: x (not in word) → U is absent.
- R: ✓ (correct position) → position 3 is R.
- E: ✓ (correct position) → position 4 is E.
- D: x (not in word) → D is absent.

Guess 3: ""cores""
- C: ✓ (correct position) → position 1 is C (confirmed).
- O: ✓ (correct position) → position 2 is O.
- R: ✓ (correct position) → position 3 is R (confirmed).
- E: ✓ (correct position) → position 4 is E (confirmed).
- S: x (not in word) → S is absent.

Now, we know the following:
- The word is of the form: C O R E _ (positions 1,2,3,4 are C, O, R, E respectively).
- The fifth letter is missing and must be determined.
- We know that A, N, U, D, and S are absent (from the x's).

Additionally, from the first guess, we know that E is not at position 5 (which is consistent since E is at 4) and R is not at position 2 (which is consistent because R is at 3).

Now, the word is ""C O R E ?"" and we need the fifth letter.

We must avoid the absent letters: A, N, U, D, S.

What are possible 5-letter words ending with ""CORE""? Actually, the word is ""CORE"" for the first four letters, so we need a word that starts with ""CORE"" and has a fifth letter.

Common words:
- ""corey"" → but that's a name? Not a common word, and also we don't know about Y.
- ""cored"" → but D is absent (from guess 2).
- ""cores"" → we just guessed and S is absent.

Other possibilities? 
- ""core"" is only 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word.

Actually, the word must be ""CORE"" + one letter at the end? But that might not be a word. Alternatively, the word could be like ""corem"" but that's not a word.

Perhaps the word is not exactly ""CORE"" as a stem. We have positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:R, 4:E, and 5:?

So the word is ""C O R E X"" where X is the fifth letter.

What words fit this pattern?

- ""corey"": if accepted, but Y might be possible. However, in standard Wordle, ""corey"" is not a solution word? It's a proper noun.
- ""corgi"": but that's C O R G I → positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:R, 4:G, 5:I → but we need position 4 to be E, not G. So no.

We have to have E at position 4.

So the only common word I can think of is ""cores"", but we just guessed it and S is absent.

But we have feedback that S is absent, so ""cores"" is not the word.

What other words are there?

Let me think: 
- ""coved"" → but D is absent and position 3 is V, not R.
- ""creek"" → position 2 is R? But we have O at position 2? And position 3 is E? But we have R at position 3.

No, the pattern is fixed: C O R E ?

So we need a word that starts with ""CORE"" and has one more letter.

Possible letters for position 5: any letter except A, N, U, D, S, and also we haven't used many letters.

But what words exist? 

- ""corey"": as above, but let's check if it's valid. In some word lists, ""corey"" is accepted as an adjective meaning having a core, but it's rare. More commonly, it's a name.

Another one: ""coria"" → but A is absent and it's not C O R E A? ""coria"" is C O R I A → position 4 is I, not E.

No.

Perhaps we missed something. The word could be ""comet"" but position 3 is M, not R.

No, position 3 is fixed as R.

List of words ending with ""E"" and having ""CORE"" as the first four letters? But that's the same.

Perhaps the word is ""score"" but that starts with S, not C.

I think we have a problem. Maybe we made a mistake.

Another idea: in the feedback for ""cores"", we have O marked as correct? So position 2 is O.

But what if the word is ""covey""? But position 3 is V, not R.

No.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any indication.

In the first guess, E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position. Now we have E at position 4. If the word has only one E, then position 5 cannot be E, which we know. But in our pattern, position 5 is not E.

But we need a word.

Let me search for words: C O R E ?

After ""core"", the only common extension is ""cores"" or ""cored"", but both are invalid.

""core"" is not a 5-letter word. So we need a 5-letter word that has C at1, O at2, R at3, E at4.

For example, ""b"" is not a word.

Another possibility: ""g"" is not a word.

Perhaps ""core"" is part of the word, but the fifth letter is added.

In English, there is ""corem"" but that's not a word.

""core"" can be a root, but with what suffix?

Perhaps we should consider that the word might be ""corer"" → C O R E R? That would be positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:R, 4:E, 5:R.

But that has two R's? And we haven't tested R at position 5.

But in the first guess, R was at position 2 and marked as present but wrong position. In the second guess, R was at position 3 and correct. So if the word has two R's, it might be possible? The feedback didn't show two R's, but in ""crane"", we had one R and it was marked. In ""cured"", we had one R and it was correct. In ""cores"", we had one R and it was correct. So if the word has two R's, then in ""crane"", it would have shown that R is present, but it didn't indicate that there might be another R. Similarly, in other guesses, only one R was present.

But it's possible that the word has only one R, so ""corer"" might not be valid.

However, let's check the feedback for ""corer"" if we guess it.

But we don't know.

Another word: ""cokes"" is not.

Perhaps ""cotes"" but position 3 is T.

No.

I think we have to consider ""corey"" or ""corer"".

But let's look back at the first guess feedback.

In the first guess, ""crane"", we had E at position 5 marked as present but wrong position. Now we have E at position 4. If the word has only one E, then position 5 cannot be E, which we know. But in ""corer"", position 5 is R, not E.

So ""corer"" is a possibility: C O R E R.

And it avoids the absent letters: no A, N, U, D, S.

Also, R is already in the word, so having another R is possible.

Similarly, in the feedback for ""crane"", R was at position 2 and marked as present (but wrong position), which is consistent with R at position 3. If there is another R at position 5, it might not have been indicated because we only had one R in the guess? But the feedback only tells us about the letters in the guess. In ""crane"", there was one R, and it was marked as present, so it means there is at least one R. It doesn't rule out a second R.

Similarly, in ""cured"" and ""cores"", we had one R and it was marked correct at position 3, which doesn't tell us about position 5.

So ""corer"" is a valid possibility.

Another word: ""coper"" → C O P E R → but position 3 is P, not R.

No.

""cover"" → position 3 is V.

No.

So ""corer"" seems to be the only common word that fits: C O R E R.

We can also think of ""cored"", but D is absent.

Or ""cores"", S is absent.

So I think we should guess ""corer"".

If it's not, then we have to try other letters.

But let's see if there are other options.

""core"" is not 5 letters.

""cire"" not.

""care"" not.

Perhaps ""bore"" not.

I think ""corer"" is the best bet.

So next guess: corer

But let's confirm the feedback we have.

We know position 2 is O, from the feedback of ""cores"": O(✓), so it's confirmed.

Similarly, positions 1,3,4 are fixed.

So the only unknown is position 5, and we have to find a letter that completes the word.

Possible letters: any except A, N, U, D, S.

But what letters can be at the end? For example, Y, R, T, L, etc.

But ""corey"" might be accepted? But ""corer"" is more common as a word (meaning a tool for coring fruit).

In Wordle, ""corer"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""baker"", but not.

So I'll go with ""corer"".

So the guess is ""corer"".Based on the feedback:

- The word is confirmed to be **C O R E ?** (positions 1-4 are fixed).
- Position 5 is the only unknown.
- Excluded letters: **A, N, U, D, S** (all marked ""x"" in previous feedback).
- The word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

Given the pattern **C O R E ?**, the only common word that fits and avoids excluded letters is **""corer""** (a tool for removing cores, e.g., from apples). 

- **""corer""** uses **C, O, R, E, R** → positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:R, 4:E, 5:R.
- It avoids A, N, U, D, S.
- The duplicate R is possible (no feedback so far has contradicted multiple R’s).

If ""corer"" is incorrect, we will get feedback on the fifth letter (R) to refine further, but it is the most likely candidate.

</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
     - C(✓): Position 1 is correct (C).
     - R(-): R is in the word but not at position 2.
     - A(x): A is not in the word.
     - N(x): N is not in the word.
     - E(-): E is in the word but not at position 5.
   - **Guess 2 (""cured"")**:
     - C(✓): Position 1 is correct (C, confirmed).
     - U(x): U is not in the word.
     - R(✓): Position 3 is correct (R).
     - E(✓): Position 4 is correct (E).
     - D(x): D is not in the word.
   - **Guess 3 (""cores"")**:
     - C(✓): Position 1 is correct (C, confirmed).
     - O(✓): Position 2 is correct (O).
     - R(✓): Position 3 is correct (R, confirmed).
     - E(✓): Position 4 is correct (E, confirmed).
     - S(x): S is not in the word.

2. **Deductions**:
   - The secret word has fixed letters in positions 1–4: **C** (pos 1), **O** (pos 2), **R** (pos 3), **E** (pos 4). The word pattern is **C O R E _**.
   - Position 5 is the only unknown letter.
   - Excluded letters (absent from the word): A, N, U, D, S (all marked ""x"").
   - The word must be a valid 5-letter English word ending with a letter that is not excluded.

3. **Identify Possible Words**:
   - Common words fitting **C O R E ?**:
     - ""corey"": Rare/proper noun, not ideal.
     - ""cored"": Invalid (D is excluded).
     - ""cores"": Invalid (S is excluded and already guessed).
     - ""corer"": A valid word (meaning a tool for coring fruit/apples). It ends with R, which is not excluded and fits the pattern.
   - Other options like ""covey"" or ""cokes"" don't match the fixed positions (e.g., ""covey"" has V at pos 3, not R).
   - Duplicate letters are possible (no feedback indicates otherwise). Since R is already at pos 3, ""corer"" (with R at pos 5) is feasible.

4. **Select the Next Guess**:
   - ""corer"" is the strongest candidate:
     - Fits **C O R E R**.
     - Avoids all excluded letters (A, N, U, D, S).
     - Tests the only unknown position (5) with a common letter (R).
   - If ""corer"" is correct, the game ends. If not, feedback on position 5 will reveal the correct letter.

Guess 1: ""crane""

- N: x (not in word) → N is absent.
