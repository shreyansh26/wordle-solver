We are at the start of the game. We have no feedback from previous guesses since this is the first guess.
 The goal is to choose a word that can provide maximum information about the secret word.
 Ideally, we want a word with common letters and letters that are often in different positions.

 Common starting words in word games often include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc., because they use common letters and have a good mix of vowels and consonants.

 Considering that, let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common. Also, it has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 However, note that the feedback will tell us which letters are present and in the right position or wrong position.

 Since there's no prior information, we can pick any reasonable word. Another popular choice is ""RAISE"".

 Let me pick ""SLATE"" because it has S, L, A, T, E: also common letters and two vowels (A and E).

 But I recall that the example used ""BRISK"", so let's try to avoid that. Actually, it doesn't matter.

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is a good starter.

 After consideration, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".
</think>
I am starting with no prior information. For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is effective because:
- It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), covering frequently used letters.
- It avoids repeating letters, allowing efficient elimination of multiple possibilities.
- If any letters match (✓ or -), I'll know they are part of the secret word; if marked (x), I can eliminate them.

This sets a strong foundation for narrowing down the secret word in subsequent guesses.

We are given that the first guess was ""CRANE"" and the feedback was all 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not use any of these letters.

 Let's think about the remaining letters. We have to avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Common vowels: We have used A and E, so the remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note that the word must have vowels.

 Common consonants: We have to avoid C, R, N. So we can use B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

 Let's try to form a word with the remaining common letters. Some common letters are S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Since we don't have A and E, we might use O and I as vowels.

 Example words: 
   ""PILOT"" -> but we have to avoid A, E, and also note that we don't have R, N, etc. But wait, ""PILOT"" uses P, I, L, O, T. None of these are in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N, E). So that's a candidate.

 Another candidate: ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T.

 Another: ""BUOYS"" -> but that has a Y and might be less common.

 We can also consider ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L. But U is a vowel and we haven't tried it.

 However, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's list the frequency of letters in 5-letter words without C, R, A, N, E.

 According to English letter frequency, after removing C, R, A, N, E, the next most common letters are: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 So a word that includes T, O, I, S, L would be good.

 The word ""TOILS"" (meaning works hard) uses T, O, I, L, S. But we can also try ""SLIPT"" (archaic for slipped) but that's not common.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a common word and uses M, O, I, S, T. We haven't tried M, O, I, S, T.

 Another option: ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S. This introduces U.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels. However, since we know the word doesn't have A and E, it must have one or more of I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

 We can also consider ""LUMPS"" but that has U and M.

 After considering, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because:
   - It uses common letters: M, O, I, S, T.
   - It covers two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (M, S, T).

 Alternatively, ""PILOT"" is also good.

 But let me check: we are avoiding C, R, A, N, E. Both ""MOIST"" and ""PILOT"" are valid.

 I'll go with ""MOIST"" for the second guess.

 So the next guess is ""MOIST"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (all letters marked as absent: C, R, A, N, E), the secret word contains **none of these letters**. Therefore, I need a new guess that:
- Excludes C, R, A, N, E entirely
- Uses common letters to maximize information gain
- Prioritizes high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, L, M) and untested vowels (O, I, U)

The word **""MOIST""** fits well:
- Letters: M, O, I, S, T (all untested and common)
- Covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T)
- Avoids repeats and excluded letters

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities by testing new high-value letters.

The word ""CRANE"" is effective because:\n- It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), covering frequently used letters.\n- It avoids repeating letters, allowing efficient elimination of multiple possibilities.\n- If any letters match (✓ or -), I\'ll know they are part of the secret word; if marked (x), I can eliminate them.\n\nThis sets a strong foundation for narrowing down the secret word in subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given that the first guess was ""CRANE"" and the feedback was all \'x\', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.\n Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not use any of these letters.\n\n Let\'s think about the remaining letters. We have to avoid: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n Common vowels: We have used A and E, so the remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note that the word must have vowels.\n\n Common consonants: We have to avoid C, R, N. So we can use B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word with the remaining common letters. Some common letters are S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n Since we don\'t have A and E, we might use O and I as vowels.\n\n Example words: \n   ""PILOT"" -> but we have to avoid A, E, and also note that we don\'t have R, N, etc. But wait, ""PILOT"" uses P, I, L, O, T. None of these are in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N, E). So that\'s a candidate.\n\n Another candidate: ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T.\n\n Another: ""BUOYS"" -> but that has a Y and might be less common.\n\n We can also consider ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L. But U is a vowel and we haven\'t tried it.\n\n However, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s list the frequency of letters in 5-letter words without C, R, A, N, E.\n\n According to English letter frequency, after removing C, R, A, N, E, the next most common letters are: T, O, I, S, L, etc.\n\n So a word that includes T, O, I, S, L would be good.\n\n The word ""TOILS"" (meaning works hard) uses T, O, I, L, S. But we can also try ""SLIPT"" (archaic for slipped) but that\'s not common.\n\n Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a common word and uses M, O, I, S, T. We haven\'t tried M, O, I, S, T.\n\n Another option: ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S. This introduces U.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels. However, since we know the word doesn\'t have A and E, it must have one or more of I, O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\n We can also consider ""LUMPS"" but that has U and M.\n\n After considering, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because:\n   - It uses common letters: M, O, I, S, T.\n   - It covers two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (M, S, T).\n\n Alternatively, ""PILOT"" is also good.\n\n But let me check: we are avoiding C, R, A, N, E. Both ""MOIST"" and ""PILOT"" are valid.\n\n I\'ll go with ""MOIST"" for the second guess.\n\n So the next guess is ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (all letters marked as absent: C, R, A, N, E), the secret word contains **none of these letters**. Therefore, I need a new guess that:\n- Excludes C, R, A, N, E entirely\n- Uses common letters to maximize information gain\n- Prioritizes high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, L, M) and untested vowels (O, I, U)\n\nThe word **""MOIST""** fits well:\n- Letters: M, O, I, S, T (all untested and common)\n- Covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T)\n- Avoids repeats and excluded letters\n\nThis guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities by testing new high-value letters.\n\n<guess>MOIST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

1. CRANE: all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the word -> we know the secret word does not contain any of these letters.
2. MOIST: M(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(x). This means:
   - M is not in the word.
   - O is not in the word.
   - I is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked as -).
   - S is not in the word.
   - T is not in the word.

So, from guess 2, we know:
- The letter I is present in the secret word, but not in the third position (since we guessed it in position 3 and it's wrong position).
- The letters M, O, S, T are absent.

Combining with the first guess, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

The only letter we know is present is I, and it must be in a position other than the third.

Therefore, the secret word contains I (but not in position 3) and does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

We need to pick a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes I (since we know it's in the word), and places it in a position other than 3.
- Uses only letters not already excluded.
- Includes other common letters to test more possibilities.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know I is in the word, so we must include it. We should try to place it in a different position: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).

We also want to test other common letters from the available set.

Common letters among the available ones: L, U, D, P, H, G, B, etc.

Given the constraints, we need a word that has I in one of positions 1,2,4,5 and uses other available letters.

Possible words:

- With I in position 1: e.g., ""IGLOO"" but O is excluded? We cannot have O. Also, it has O which is excluded. So invalid.

Let me think of words that fit:

- Consider placing I in the first position?
  Example: ""INPUT"" -> but U and P? Wait, but T is excluded -> T is excluded so we cannot use T.

We must avoid excluded letters.

Some ideas:

- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> I is in position 3, but we already know I is not in position 3? Actually, no: we have I in position 3 in MOIST and it was wrong position, meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So we can have I in position 3? No, feedback says I(-) and we placed it in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3 in the secret word. So we must avoid putting I in position 3 again? Actually, no, we can put it anywhere, but we must not put it in position 3 because we already know it's not there. But if we put it in position 3 again, the feedback would again say it's wrong position? Yes, but that doesn't give us new information. So it's better to try a different position.

We should try I in a position we haven't tried before to see if it is correct.

Since the feedback for I in position 3 was wrong, the I must be in position 1,2,4, or 5.

So for the next guess, let's try I in position 1, for example.

Word with I in position 1: 
  - ""IGLUS"" -> not common? Or ""IGLUS"" is not standard.
  - ""INBOX"": but N is excluded (from first guess), so cannot.
  - ""IMBUE"": M is excluded -> invalid.
  - ""ILLUS"": not a word? ""ILLUS"" is not valid.

Another word: ""PICKY"" -> P, I, C, K, Y -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

What about ""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> but C and E are excluded -> invalid.

""BILLY"": B, I, L, L, Y -> letters: B, I, L, Y. We have I and L? But L is available? Yes, and we haven't tested L.

But note: we can use L, but we have to avoid excluded letters. Also, ""BILLY"" has double L? But that's acceptable.

However, we are testing new letters.

Another word: ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> but doesn't include I? We must include I because we know it's in the word. So the guess must include I.

Important: we know I is in the word, so any guess without I would not be logical because we are trying to find the exact position and test other letters.

So the word must include I.

Now, position: if we try I in position 1:

Possible words: ""INLAY"" -> but N is excluded, A is excluded? A is excluded -> no.

""IDLER"" -> but R is excluded -> no.

""FISHY"" -> but S is excluded and H? S is excluded -> invalid.

""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T -> T is excluded -> invalid.

Position 2: maybe better.

Words with I in position 2: 
  - ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> no excluded letters? B, U, I, L, D -> check: excluded are C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S,T. So BUILD: B,U,I,L,D are all allowed.
  - ""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D -> also valid.

Position 4: ""PLUGS"" -> but S excluded? And G and L? Actually, ""PLUGS"" has S -> excluded -> invalid.

Position 5: ""TULIP"" -> T excluded, invalid.

So let's consider words with I in position 2: BUILD or GUILD.

BUILD: letters B,U,I,L,D

GUILD: letters G,U,I,L,D

Both test U, L, D and either B or G.

Which one? We can choose one. Let me pick BUILD, for example.

But we can also consider words with I in position 1? There are fewer because many words with I in first position require vowels we have excluded? For example, ""IRATE"": has R and A, excluded. ""IMAGE"": has M and E? M excluded. ""ITCHY"": has T? excluded.

Actually, position 1 is hard.

Another word: ""QUICK"" but Q, C, K? C excluded.

""WIMPY"": W,I,M,P,Y -> M excluded.

So words with I in position 2 seem feasible.

Alternatively, I in position 4: 
  - ""HUMID"": H,U,M,I,D -> M excluded.
  - ""VALID"": V,A,L,I,D -> A excluded.
  - ""LUPIN"": but U,P,I,N -> N excluded? from first guess? Yes, N is excluded.

Position 5: ""FUNGI"": F,U,N,G,I -> N excluded.

So position 2 is decent.

Another position 2 word: ""BLIND"" -> L,I,N,D -> N excluded, invalid.

""SKIMP"" -> S,K,I,M,P -> all excluded? S and M excluded -> invalid.

""THICK"" -> T excluded and C excluded.

So BUILD and GUILD are good candidates.

Also, ""JUICY"" -> J,U,I,C,Y -> C excluded ? invalid.

""QUILL"": Q,U,I,L,L -> that's Q,U,I,L. Double L? And we can test Q.

But I think BUILD or GUILD are better because they use more common letters.

Between BUILD and GUILD, we don't know which is better. We haven't tested B, G, U, L, D, so both are equal in information.

But we might prefer BUILD because B is slightly more common than G? Or GUILD because G might be more common? According to letter frequency in English words, B is more frequent than G? Actually, G is slightly more common than B, but not significantly.

Anyway, let's pick one.

Another word: ""GUILT"" -> G,U,I,L,T -> but T is excluded -> invalid.

So BUILD seems good: B,U,I,L,D.

GUILD: G,U,I,L,D.

Also, ""DUCHY"": D,U,C,H,Y -> C excluded -> invalid.

So BUILD or GUILD.

I'll go with ""BUILD"".

Therefore, third guess: BUILD.

Place I in position 2 (which is a new position) to see if it's correct.

If the I is in position 2, it might get ✓, or if not but in the word then -.

We expect either (if correct) I(✓) or if it's elsewhere then I(-) again.

But we also test B,U,L,D.

Now, note: we know I is in the word, but when we guess BUILD, if I is in the secret word but not in position 2, then the feedback for I will be -, and we know it's not in position 2 either? It could be in position 1,3,4,5? But we already tried position 3 and it was -, so not there. Position 1,4,5 are still possible.

But secret word could have I only once? We don't know, but Wordle words are unique letters? Not necessary, they can have repeated letters? I think they can, like ""SISSY"", but in our feedback we are not showing duplicates explicitly.

But in BUILD, all letters are unique, and we are testing each.

So let's choose BUILD as the third guess.
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- **C, R, A, N, E** from Guess 1 (CRANE) are absent (all marked as `x`).
- **M, O, S, T** from Guess 2 (MOIST) are absent (all marked as `x`).
- **I** is present (marked as `-`), but not in position 3.

Therefore:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T
- **Present letter**: I (must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 of the secret word)
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Strategy:
- Since I is confirmed, the new guess must include I (to test its position) and avoid excluded letters.
- I should be placed in a new position (not position 3) to gather more information—ideally position 2 to test a common middle slot.
- Focus on testing common consonants like L, D, and U to maximize information gain.
- A strong candidate is ""BUILD"":
  - Includes I in position 2 (new position to test).
  - Uses four new common letters (B, U, L, D), covering multiple test cases efficiently.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

 The goal is to choose a word that can provide maximum information about the secret word.
 Ideally, we want a word with common letters and letters that are often in different positions.

 Common starting words in word games often include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc., because they use common letters and have a good mix of vowels and consonants.

 Considering that, let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common. Also, it has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 However, note that the feedback will tell us which letters are present and in the right position or wrong position.

 Since there's no prior information, we can pick any reasonable word. Another popular choice is ""RAISE"".

 Let me pick ""SLATE"" because it has S, L, A, T, E: also common letters and two vowels (A and E).

 But I recall that the example used ""BRISK"", so let's try to avoid that. Actually, it doesn't matter.

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is a good starter.

 After consideration, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I am starting with no prior information. For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is effective because:
- It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), covering frequently used letters.
- It avoids repeating letters, allowing efficient elimination of multiple possibilities.
- If any letters match (✓ or -), I'll know they are part of the secret word; if marked (x), I can eliminate them.

This sets a strong foundation for narrowing down the secret word in subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given that the first guess was ""CRANE"" and the feedback was all 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not use any of these letters.

 Let's think about the remaining letters. We have to avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Common vowels: We have used A and E, so the remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note that the word must have vowels.

 Common consonants: We have to avoid C, R, N. So we can use B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

 Let's try to form a word with the remaining common letters. Some common letters are S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Since we don't have A and E, we might use O and I as vowels.

 Example words: 
   ""PILOT"" -> but we have to avoid A, E, and also note that we don't have R, N, etc. But wait, ""PILOT"" uses P, I, L, O, T. None of these are in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N, E). So that's a candidate.

 Another candidate: ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T.

 Another: ""BUOYS"" -> but that has a Y and might be less common.

 We can also consider ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L. But U is a vowel and we haven't tried it.

 However, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's list the frequency of letters in 5-letter words without C, R, A, N, E.

 According to English letter frequency, after removing C, R, A, N, E, the next most common letters are: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 So a word that includes T, O, I, S, L would be good.

 The word ""TOILS"" (meaning works hard) uses T, O, I, L, S. But we can also try ""SLIPT"" (archaic for slipped) but that's not common.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a common word and uses M, O, I, S, T. We haven't tried M, O, I, S, T.

 Another option: ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S. This introduces U.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels. However, since we know the word doesn't have A and E, it must have one or more of I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

 We can also consider ""LUMPS"" but that has U and M.

 After considering, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because:
   - It uses common letters: M, O, I, S, T.
   - It covers two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (M, S, T).

 Alternatively, ""PILOT"" is also good.

 But let me check: we are avoiding C, R, A, N, E. Both ""MOIST"" and ""PILOT"" are valid.

 I'll go with ""MOIST"" for the second guess.

 So the next guess is ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (all letters marked as absent: C, R, A, N, E), the secret word contains **none of these letters**. Therefore, I need a new guess that:
- Excludes C, R, A, N, E entirely
- Uses common letters to maximize information gain
- Prioritizes high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, L, M) and untested vowels (O, I, U)

The word **""MOIST""** fits well:
- Letters: M, O, I, S, T (all untested and common)
- Covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T)
- Avoids repeats and excluded letters

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities by testing new high-value letters.

<guess>MOIST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. CRANE: all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the word -> we know the secret word does not contain any of these letters.
2. MOIST: M(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(x). This means:
   - M is not in the word.
   - O is not in the word.
   - I is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked as -).
   - S is not in the word.
   - T is not in the word.

So, from guess 2, we know:
- The letter I is present in the secret word, but not in the third position (since we guessed it in position 3 and it's wrong position).
- The letters M, O, S, T are absent.

Combining with the first guess, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

The only letter we know is present is I, and it must be in a position other than the third.

Therefore, the secret word contains I (but not in position 3) and does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

We need to pick a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes I (since we know it's in the word), and places it in a position other than 3.
- Uses only letters not already excluded.
- Includes other common letters to test more possibilities.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know I is in the word, so we must include it. We should try to place it in a different position: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).

We also want to test other common letters from the available set.

Common letters among the available ones: L, U, D, P, H, G, B, etc.

Given the constraints, we need a word that has I in one of positions 1,2,4,5 and uses other available letters.

Possible words:

- With I in position 1: e.g., ""IGLOO"" but O is excluded? We cannot have O. Also, it has O which is excluded. So invalid.

Let me think of words that fit:

- Consider placing I in the first position?
  Example: ""INPUT"" -> but U and P? Wait, but T is excluded -> T is excluded so we cannot use T.

We must avoid excluded letters.

Some ideas:

- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> I is in position 3, but we already know I is not in position 3? Actually, no: we have I in position 3 in MOIST and it was wrong position, meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So we can have I in position 3? No, feedback says I(-) and we placed it in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3 in the secret word. So we must avoid putting I in position 3 again? Actually, no, we can put it anywhere, but we must not put it in position 3 because we already know it's not there. But if we put it in position 3 again, the feedback would again say it's wrong position? Yes, but that doesn't give us new information. So it's better to try a different position.

We should try I in a position we haven't tried before to see if it is correct.

Since the feedback for I in position 3 was wrong, the I must be in position 1,2,4, or 5.

So for the next guess, let's try I in position 1, for example.

Word with I in position 1: 
  - ""IGLUS"" -> not common? Or ""IGLUS"" is not standard.
  - ""INBOX"": but N is excluded (from first guess), so cannot.
  - ""IMBUE"": M is excluded -> invalid.
  - ""ILLUS"": not a word? ""ILLUS"" is not valid.

Another word: ""PICKY"" -> P, I, C, K, Y -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

What about ""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> but C and E are excluded -> invalid.

""BILLY"": B, I, L, L, Y -> letters: B, I, L, Y. We have I and L? But L is available? Yes, and we haven't tested L.

But note: we can use L, but we have to avoid excluded letters. Also, ""BILLY"" has double L? But that's acceptable.

However, we are testing new letters.

Another word: ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> but doesn't include I? We must include I because we know it's in the word. So the guess must include I.

Important: we know I is in the word, so any guess without I would not be logical because we are trying to find the exact position and test other letters.

So the word must include I.

Now, position: if we try I in position 1:

Possible words: ""INLAY"" -> but N is excluded, A is excluded? A is excluded -> no.

""IDLER"" -> but R is excluded -> no.

""FISHY"" -> but S is excluded and H? S is excluded -> invalid.

""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T -> T is excluded -> invalid.

Position 2: maybe better.

Words with I in position 2: 
  - ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> no excluded letters? B, U, I, L, D -> check: excluded are C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S,T. So BUILD: B,U,I,L,D are all allowed.
  - ""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D -> also valid.

Position 4: ""PLUGS"" -> but S excluded? And G and L? Actually, ""PLUGS"" has S -> excluded -> invalid.

Position 5: ""TULIP"" -> T excluded, invalid.

So let's consider words with I in position 2: BUILD or GUILD.

BUILD: letters B,U,I,L,D

GUILD: letters G,U,I,L,D

Both test U, L, D and either B or G.

Which one? We can choose one. Let me pick BUILD, for example.

But we can also consider words with I in position 1? There are fewer because many words with I in first position require vowels we have excluded? For example, ""IRATE"": has R and A, excluded. ""IMAGE"": has M and E? M excluded. ""ITCHY"": has T? excluded.

Actually, position 1 is hard.

Another word: ""QUICK"" but Q, C, K? C excluded.

""WIMPY"": W,I,M,P,Y -> M excluded.

So words with I in position 2 seem feasible.

Alternatively, I in position 4: 
  - ""HUMID"": H,U,M,I,D -> M excluded.
  - ""VALID"": V,A,L,I,D -> A excluded.
  - ""LUPIN"": but U,P,I,N -> N excluded? from first guess? Yes, N is excluded.

Position 5: ""FUNGI"": F,U,N,G,I -> N excluded.

So position 2 is decent.

Another position 2 word: ""BLIND"" -> L,I,N,D -> N excluded, invalid.

""SKIMP"" -> S,K,I,M,P -> all excluded? S and M excluded -> invalid.

""THICK"" -> T excluded and C excluded.

So BUILD and GUILD are good candidates.

Also, ""JUICY"" -> J,U,I,C,Y -> C excluded ? invalid.

""QUILL"": Q,U,I,L,L -> that's Q,U,I,L. Double L? And we can test Q.

But I think BUILD or GUILD are better because they use more common letters.

Between BUILD and GUILD, we don't know which is better. We haven't tested B, G, U, L, D, so both are equal in information.

But we might prefer BUILD because B is slightly more common than G? Or GUILD because G might be more common? According to letter frequency in English words, B is more frequent than G? Actually, G is slightly more common than B, but not significantly.

Anyway, let's pick one.

Another word: ""GUILT"" -> G,U,I,L,T -> but T is excluded -> invalid.

So BUILD seems good: B,U,I,L,D.

GUILD: G,U,I,L,D.

Also, ""DUCHY"": D,U,C,H,Y -> C excluded -> invalid.

So BUILD or GUILD.

I'll go with ""BUILD"".

Therefore, third guess: BUILD.

Place I in position 2 (which is a new position) to see if it's correct.

If the I is in position 2, it might get ✓, or if not but in the word then -.

We expect either (if correct) I(✓) or if it's elsewhere then I(-) again.

But we also test B,U,L,D.

Now, note: we know I is in the word, but when we guess BUILD, if I is in the secret word but not in position 2, then the feedback for I will be -, and we know it's not in position 2 either? It could be in position 1,3,4,5? But we already tried position 3 and it was -, so not there. Position 1,4,5 are still possible.

But secret word could have I only once? We don't know, but Wordle words are unique letters? Not necessary, they can have repeated letters? I think they can, like ""SISSY"", but in our feedback we are not showing duplicates explicitly.

But in BUILD, all letters are unique, and we are testing each.

So let's choose BUILD as the third guess.Based on the feedback:
- **C, R, A, N, E** from Guess 1 (CRANE) are absent (all marked as `x`).
- **M, O, S, T** from Guess 2 (MOIST) are absent (all marked as `x`).
- **I** is present (marked as `-`), but not in position 3.

Therefore:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T
- **Present letter**: I (must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 of the secret word)
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Strategy:
- Since I is confirmed, the new guess must include I (to test its position) and avoid excluded letters.
- I should be placed in a new position (not position 3) to gather more information—ideally position 2 to test a common middle slot.
- Focus on testing common consonants like L, D, and U to maximize information gain.
- A strong candidate is ""BUILD"":
  - Includes I in position 2 (new position to test).
  - Uses four new common letters (B, U, L, D), covering multiple test cases efficiently.

Actually, G is slightly more common than B, but not significantly.\n\nAnyway, let\'s pick one.\n\nAnother word: ""GUILT"" -> G,U,I,L,T -> but T is excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo BUILD seems good: B,U,I,L,D.\n\nGUILD: G,U,I,L,D.\n\nAlso, ""DUCHY"": D,U,C,H,Y -> C excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo BUILD or GUILD.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BUILD"".\n\nTherefore, third guess: BUILD.\n\nPlace I in position 2 (which is a new position) to see if it\'s correct.\n\nIf the I is in position 2, it might get ✓, or if not but in the word then -.\n\nWe expect either (if correct) I(✓) or if it\'s elsewhere then I(-) again.\n\nBut we also test B,U,L,D.\n\nNow, note: we know I is in the word, but when we guess BUILD, if I is in the secret word but not in position 2, then the feedback for I will be -, and we know it\'s not in position 2 either? It could be in position 1,3,4,5? But we already tried position 3 and it was -, so not there. Position 1,4,5 are still possible.\n\nBut secret word could have I only once? We don\'t know, but Wordle words are unique letters? Not necessary, they can have repeated letters? I think they can, like ""SISSY"", but in our feedback we are not showing duplicates explicitly.\n\nBut in BUILD, all letters are unique, and we are testing each.\n\nSo let\'s choose BUILD as the third guess.Based on the feedback:\n- **C, R, A, N, E** from Guess 1 (CRANE) are absent (all marked as `x`).\n- **M, O, S, T** from Guess 2 (MOIST) are absent (all marked as `x`).\n- **I** is present (marked as `-`), but not in position 3.\n\nTherefore:\n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T\n- **Present letter**: I (must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 of the secret word)\n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nStrategy:\n- Since I is confirmed, the new guess must include I (to test its position) and avoid excluded letters.\n- I should be placed in a new position (not position 3) to gather more information—ideally position 2 to test a common middle slot.\n- Focus on testing common consonants like L, D, and U to maximize information gain.\n- A strong candidate is ""BUILD"":\n  - Includes I in position 2 (new position to test).\n  - Uses four new common letters (B, U, L, D), covering multiple test cases efficiently.\n\n<guess>BUILD</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: BUILD -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(x) I(-) L(x) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
Guess 2: MOIST -> M, O, S, T absent; I present but in wrong position (not position 3).
Guess 3: BUILD -> B, U, L, D absent; I present but in wrong position (not position 2, since we placed it in position 3? Wait, let's check positions).

In BUILD, we placed I in position 3? Actually, in BUILD:
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: D

But in the feedback for BUILD: B(x) U(x) I(-) L(x) D(x)

So I is present but not in position 3? But we already knew from MOIST that I is not in position 3. Now we also know that I is not in position 3 (again, but we already knew) and also we learn that it's not in position 3? Actually, the feedback for I in BUILD is ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. But we already knew that from the previous guess.

Moreover, we now know that B, U, L, D are absent.

So combining all:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T, B, U, L, D

Present letters: I (but not in position 3, and now not in position 3 again? We still don't know where it is).

We have tested I in position 3 (MOIST) and position 3 (BUILD) — both times position 3? In MOIST, I was in position 3, and in BUILD, I was also in position 3? That was a mistake.

In MOIST: positions: M(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), T(5) -> I in position 3, feedback: I(-) meaning I is in the word but not in position 3.

In BUILD: positions: B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) -> again I in position 3, feedback: I(-) meaning again, I is in the word but not in position 3. This doesn't give new information about the position of I, only that it is still not in position 3.

But we already knew that. So we wasted a position? We should have put I in a different position.

Now we know that I is not in position 3, and we have no information about other positions because we haven't tried them.

Additionally, we have excluded many letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T, B, U, L, D.

So the available letters are: F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and I (which we know is present).

We must include I in the next guess, and we should try it in a position we haven't tried before. We have only tried position 3 so far. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also need to form a word with the available letters.

Let's list the available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that includes I and four of these letters.

Possible words:

- With I in position 1:
  - ""IGLOO"" -> but O and L are excluded -> invalid.
  - ""INKED"" -> N and E excluded -> invalid.
  - ""IVORY"" -> O and R excluded -> invalid.
  - ""ITCHY"" -> T and H? T excluded -> invalid.
  - ""INFER"" -> N, F, E, R -> N, E, R excluded -> invalid.

It's hard to find words with I in position 1 without using excluded letters.

- With I in position 2:
  - ""PIQUE"" -> P, I, Q, U, E -> U and E excluded -> invalid.
  - ""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E -> all excluded -> invalid.
  - ""KIOSK"" -> K, I, O, S, K -> O and S excluded -> invalid.
  - ""GIANT"" -> G, I, A, N, T -> A, N, T excluded -> invalid.

Also hard.

- With I in position 4:
  - ""SPRIG"" -> S, P, R, I, G -> S, R excluded -> invalid.
  - ""FLICK"" -> F, L, I, C, K -> L, C excluded -> invalid.
  - ""JUVIE"" -> J, U, V, I, E -> U, E excluded -> invalid.

- With I in position 5:
  - ""TAXI"" -> too short? We need 5 letters.
  - ""ALIBI"" -> A, L, I, B, I -> A, L, B excluded -> invalid.
  - ""RABBI"" -> R, A, B, B, I -> R, A, B excluded -> invalid.

This is difficult. We might need to use Y as a vowel.

Let's try words with Y.

For example, with I in position 1: ""IVORY"" -> O excluded.

With I in position 2: ""PYGMY"" -> P, Y, G, M, Y -> M excluded? M is excluded -> invalid.

With I in position 4: ""HAPPY"" -> H, A, P, P, Y -> A excluded -> invalid.

With I in position 5: ""FUNGI"" -> F, U, N, G, I -> U, N excluded -> invalid.

Another idea: ""PIETY"" -> P, I, E, T, Y -> E, T excluded -> invalid.

""WIMPY"" -> W, I, M, P, Y -> M excluded -> invalid.

""JIVED"" -> J, I, V, E, D -> E, D excluded -> invalid.

We are running out of options.

Perhaps we missed a letter? Available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And we know I is in the word.

What about ""WHIZZ""? But that has double Z and is not common? Also, Z is not very common.

""JAZZY"" -> J, A, Z, Z, Y -> A excluded -> invalid.

""FUZZY"" -> F, U, Z, Z, Y -> U excluded -> invalid.

""JIFFY"" -> J, I, F, F, Y -> F and Y are available? Let's check: F is available, Y is available. But double F? That's acceptable.

""JIFFY"": J, I, F, F, Y.

Positions: J(1), I(2), F(3), F(4), Y(5)

We haven't tried I in position 2 before? We tried in position 3 twice, but not in 2.

So this word uses J, I, F, Y. And it has double F, but that's okay.

But we are testing F and Y, and J.

Is ""JIFFY"" a valid word? It means a short period of time, like ""in a jiffy"". Yes, it's acceptable.

And it doesn't use any excluded letters: excluded are C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S,T,B,U,L,D.

So J, I, F, Y are all allowed.

But we have two F's? That's fine, but we are testing F only once? Actually, we are testing F in position 3 and 4, but if the word has only one F, then one of them will be absent? But we don't know.

But it's a valid word.

Another word: ""PIZZY""? Not a word.

""ZIPPY"" -> Z, I, P, P, Y -> that's a word, meaning lively.

""ZIPPY"": Z, I, P, P, Y.

Positions: Z(1), I(2), P(3), P(4), Y(5)

Again, I in position 2.

Available letters: Z, I, P, Y are all allowed.

We haven't tested P or Z or Y.

So ""ZIPPY"" is also a candidate.

Another: ""JIFFY"" or ""ZIPPY"".

We can also consider ""KIWI"" but that's 4 letters.

""KIWIS"" -> S excluded -> invalid.

""WIZEN"" -> W, I, Z, E, N -> E, N excluded -> invalid.

So ""JIFFY"" and ""ZIPPY"" are candidates.

I think ""ZIPPY"" is more common? Or ""JIFFY"".

But let's choose one.

We can also consider ""FJORD"" but that has O and R? O and R excluded -> invalid.

Another word: ""QUIFF"" -> Q, U, I, F, F -> U excluded -> invalid.

""VIXEN"" -> V, I, X, E, N -> E, N excluded -> invalid.

So I think ""ZIPPY"" is a good choice.

But in ""ZIPPY"", we have I in position 2, which we haven't tried.

We can also try I in position 4 or 5.

For example, ""PUDGY"" but U and D excluded.

""GYPSY"" -> G, Y, P, S, Y -> S excluded -> invalid.

""LYMPH"" -> L, Y, M, P, H -> L, M excluded -> invalid.

So position 2 seems the easiest.

Another word: ""HIJAB"" -> H, I, J, A, B -> A and B excluded -> invalid.

""KIOSK"" -> O and S excluded.

So I think ""ZIPPY"" is acceptable.

But let's confirm the word: ZIPPY is a valid English word.

We'll guess ""ZIPPY"".

But note: we have two P's. If the secret word has only one P, then one of the P's might be marked as absent, but that's okay.

We are also testing Z, I, P, Y.

So let's go with ""ZIPPY"".

But we must include I, and we are including it in position 2.

If I is in position 2, we might get a match, or if not, then we know it's not in position 2.

We have only 3 guesses left? We are on guess 4.

After this, we have two more guesses.

So guess 4: ZIPPY.

But let's write it.
</think>
The feedback from previous guesses reveals:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T, B, U, L, D (all marked as `x`).
- **Present letter**: I (confirmed present but not in position 3, as per Guess 2 and Guess 3).
- **Available letters**: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **I's position constraints**: Since I was tested in position 3 twice (in ""MOIST"" and ""BUILD"") and was marked as `-` both times, it cannot be in position 3. It must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the next guess:
- I must be included to determine its correct position.
- I should be placed in a new position (not position 3) to gain new information. Position 2 is untested and common for I.
- The word should maximize new letter coverage using high-frequency available letters (e.g., P, Y, F, G) to narrow possibilities.
- ""ZIPPY"" is a strong choice:
  - Places I in position 2 (new position to test).
  - Uses new letters: Z, P, Y (P appears twice, testing for duplicates).
  - Avoids all excluded letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are at the start of the game. We have no feedback from previous guesses since this is the first guess.
 The goal is to choose a word that can provide maximum information about the secret word.
 Ideally, we want a word with common letters and letters that are often in different positions.

 Common starting words in word games often include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc., because they use common letters and have a good mix of vowels and consonants.

 Considering that, let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common. Also, it has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 However, note that the feedback will tell us which letters are present and in the right position or wrong position.

 Since there's no prior information, we can pick any reasonable word. Another popular choice is ""RAISE"".

 Let me pick ""SLATE"" because it has S, L, A, T, E: also common letters and two vowels (A and E).

 But I recall that the example used ""BRISK"", so let's try to avoid that. Actually, it doesn't matter.

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is a good starter.

 After consideration, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I am starting with no prior information. For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants. The word ""CRANE"" is effective because:
- It contains three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), covering frequently used letters.
- It avoids repeating letters, allowing efficient elimination of multiple possibilities.
- If any letters match (✓ or -), I'll know they are part of the secret word; if marked (x), I can eliminate them.

This sets a strong foundation for narrowing down the secret word in subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given that the first guess was ""CRANE"" and the feedback was all 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not use any of these letters.

 Let's think about the remaining letters. We have to avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Common vowels: We have used A and E, so the remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note that the word must have vowels.

 Common consonants: We have to avoid C, R, N. So we can use B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of getting hits.

 Let's try to form a word with the remaining common letters. Some common letters are S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Since we don't have A and E, we might use O and I as vowels.

 Example words: 
   ""PILOT"" -> but we have to avoid A, E, and also note that we don't have R, N, etc. But wait, ""PILOT"" uses P, I, L, O, T. None of these are in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N, E). So that's a candidate.

 Another candidate: ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T.

 Another: ""BUOYS"" -> but that has a Y and might be less common.

 We can also consider ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L. But U is a vowel and we haven't tried it.

 However, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's list the frequency of letters in 5-letter words without C, R, A, N, E.

 According to English letter frequency, after removing C, R, A, N, E, the next most common letters are: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 So a word that includes T, O, I, S, L would be good.

 The word ""TOILS"" (meaning works hard) uses T, O, I, L, S. But we can also try ""SLIPT"" (archaic for slipped) but that's not common.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a common word and uses M, O, I, S, T. We haven't tried M, O, I, S, T.

 Another option: ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S. This introduces U.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels. However, since we know the word doesn't have A and E, it must have one or more of I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

 We can also consider ""LUMPS"" but that has U and M.

 After considering, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because:
   - It uses common letters: M, O, I, S, T.
   - It covers two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (M, S, T).

 Alternatively, ""PILOT"" is also good.

 But let me check: we are avoiding C, R, A, N, E. Both ""MOIST"" and ""PILOT"" are valid.

 I'll go with ""MOIST"" for the second guess.

 So the next guess is ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (all letters marked as absent: C, R, A, N, E), the secret word contains **none of these letters**. Therefore, I need a new guess that:
- Excludes C, R, A, N, E entirely
- Uses common letters to maximize information gain
- Prioritizes high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, L, M) and untested vowels (O, I, U)

The word **""MOIST""** fits well:
- Letters: M, O, I, S, T (all untested and common)
- Covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T)
- Avoids repeats and excluded letters

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities by testing new high-value letters.

<guess>MOIST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. CRANE: all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the word -> we know the secret word does not contain any of these letters.
2. MOIST: M(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(x). This means:
   - M is not in the word.
   - O is not in the word.
   - I is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked as -).
   - S is not in the word.
   - T is not in the word.

So, from guess 2, we know:
- The letter I is present in the secret word, but not in the third position (since we guessed it in position 3 and it's wrong position).
- The letters M, O, S, T are absent.

Combining with the first guess, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

The only letter we know is present is I, and it must be in a position other than the third.

Therefore, the secret word contains I (but not in position 3) and does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

We need to pick a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes I (since we know it's in the word), and places it in a position other than 3.
- Uses only letters not already excluded.
- Includes other common letters to test more possibilities.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know I is in the word, so we must include it. We should try to place it in a different position: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).

We also want to test other common letters from the available set.

Common letters among the available ones: L, U, D, P, H, G, B, etc.

Given the constraints, we need a word that has I in one of positions 1,2,4,5 and uses other available letters.

Possible words:

- With I in position 1: e.g., ""IGLOO"" but O is excluded? We cannot have O. Also, it has O which is excluded. So invalid.

Let me think of words that fit:

- Consider placing I in the first position?
  Example: ""INPUT"" -> but U and P? Wait, but T is excluded -> T is excluded so we cannot use T.

We must avoid excluded letters.

Some ideas:

- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> I is in position 3, but we already know I is not in position 3? Actually, no: we have I in position 3 in MOIST and it was wrong position, meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So we can have I in position 3? No, feedback says I(-) and we placed it in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3 in the secret word. So we must avoid putting I in position 3 again? Actually, no, we can put it anywhere, but we must not put it in position 3 because we already know it's not there. But if we put it in position 3 again, the feedback would again say it's wrong position? Yes, but that doesn't give us new information. So it's better to try a different position.

We should try I in a position we haven't tried before to see if it is correct.

Since the feedback for I in position 3 was wrong, the I must be in position 1,2,4, or 5.

So for the next guess, let's try I in position 1, for example.

Word with I in position 1: 
  - ""IGLUS"" -> not common? Or ""IGLUS"" is not standard.
  - ""INBOX"": but N is excluded (from first guess), so cannot.
  - ""IMBUE"": M is excluded -> invalid.
  - ""ILLUS"": not a word? ""ILLUS"" is not valid.

Another word: ""PICKY"" -> P, I, C, K, Y -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

What about ""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> but C and E are excluded -> invalid.

""BILLY"": B, I, L, L, Y -> letters: B, I, L, Y. We have I and L? But L is available? Yes, and we haven't tested L.

But note: we can use L, but we have to avoid excluded letters. Also, ""BILLY"" has double L? But that's acceptable.

However, we are testing new letters.

Another word: ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> but doesn't include I? We must include I because we know it's in the word. So the guess must include I.

Important: we know I is in the word, so any guess without I would not be logical because we are trying to find the exact position and test other letters.

So the word must include I.

Now, position: if we try I in position 1:

Possible words: ""INLAY"" -> but N is excluded, A is excluded? A is excluded -> no.

""IDLER"" -> but R is excluded -> no.

""FISHY"" -> but S is excluded and H? S is excluded -> invalid.

""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T -> T is excluded -> invalid.

Position 2: maybe better.

Words with I in position 2: 
  - ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> no excluded letters? B, U, I, L, D -> check: excluded are C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S,T. So BUILD: B,U,I,L,D are all allowed.
  - ""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D -> also valid.

Position 4: ""PLUGS"" -> but S excluded? And G and L? Actually, ""PLUGS"" has S -> excluded -> invalid.

Position 5: ""TULIP"" -> T excluded, invalid.

So let's consider words with I in position 2: BUILD or GUILD.

BUILD: letters B,U,I,L,D

GUILD: letters G,U,I,L,D

Both test U, L, D and either B or G.

Which one? We can choose one. Let me pick BUILD, for example.

But we can also consider words with I in position 1? There are fewer because many words with I in first position require vowels we have excluded? For example, ""IRATE"": has R and A, excluded. ""IMAGE"": has M and E? M excluded. ""ITCHY"": has T? excluded.

Actually, position 1 is hard.

Another word: ""QUICK"" but Q, C, K? C excluded.

""WIMPY"": W,I,M,P,Y -> M excluded.

So words with I in position 2 seem feasible.

Alternatively, I in position 4: 
  - ""HUMID"": H,U,M,I,D -> M excluded.
  - ""VALID"": V,A,L,I,D -> A excluded.
  - ""LUPIN"": but U,P,I,N -> N excluded? from first guess? Yes, N is excluded.

Position 5: ""FUNGI"": F,U,N,G,I -> N excluded.

So position 2 is decent.

Another position 2 word: ""BLIND"" -> L,I,N,D -> N excluded, invalid.

""SKIMP"" -> S,K,I,M,P -> all excluded? S and M excluded -> invalid.

""THICK"" -> T excluded and C excluded.

So BUILD and GUILD are good candidates.

Also, ""JUICY"" -> J,U,I,C,Y -> C excluded ? invalid.

""QUILL"": Q,U,I,L,L -> that's Q,U,I,L. Double L? And we can test Q.

But I think BUILD or GUILD are better because they use more common letters.

Between BUILD and GUILD, we don't know which is better. We haven't tested B, G, U, L, D, so both are equal in information.

But we might prefer BUILD because B is slightly more common than G? Or GUILD because G might be more common? According to letter frequency in English words, B is more frequent than G? Actually, G is slightly more common than B, but not significantly.

Anyway, let's pick one.

Another word: ""GUILT"" -> G,U,I,L,T -> but T is excluded -> invalid.

So BUILD seems good: B,U,I,L,D.

GUILD: G,U,I,L,D.

Also, ""DUCHY"": D,U,C,H,Y -> C excluded -> invalid.

So BUILD or GUILD.

I'll go with ""BUILD"".

Therefore, third guess: BUILD.

Place I in position 2 (which is a new position) to see if it's correct.

If the I is in position 2, it might get ✓, or if not but in the word then -.

We expect either (if correct) I(✓) or if it's elsewhere then I(-) again.

But we also test B,U,L,D.

Now, note: we know I is in the word, but when we guess BUILD, if I is in the secret word but not in position 2, then the feedback for I will be -, and we know it's not in position 2 either? It could be in position 1,3,4,5? But we already tried position 3 and it was -, so not there. Position 1,4,5 are still possible.

But secret word could have I only once? We don't know, but Wordle words are unique letters? Not necessary, they can have repeated letters? I think they can, like ""SISSY"", but in our feedback we are not showing duplicates explicitly.

But in BUILD, all letters are unique, and we are testing each.

So let's choose BUILD as the third guess.Based on the feedback:
- **C, R, A, N, E** from Guess 1 (CRANE) are absent (all marked as `x`).
- **M, O, S, T** from Guess 2 (MOIST) are absent (all marked as `x`).
- **I** is present (marked as `-`), but not in position 3.

Therefore:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T
- **Present letter**: I (must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 of the secret word)
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Strategy:
- Since I is confirmed, the new guess must include I (to test its position) and avoid excluded letters.
- I should be placed in a new position (not position 3) to gather more information—ideally position 2 to test a common middle slot.
- Focus on testing common consonants like L, D, and U to maximize information gain.
- A strong candidate is ""BUILD"":
  - Includes I in position 2 (new position to test).
  - Uses four new common letters (B, U, L, D), covering multiple test cases efficiently.

<guess>BUILD</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x)
Guess 3: BUILD -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(x) I(-) L(x) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
Guess 2: MOIST -> M, O, S, T absent; I present but in wrong position (not position 3).
Guess 3: BUILD -> B, U, L, D absent; I present but in wrong position (not position 2, since we placed it in position 3? Wait, let's check positions).

In BUILD, we placed I in position 3? Actually, in BUILD:
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: L
  Position 5: D

But in the feedback for BUILD: B(x) U(x) I(-) L(x) D(x)

So I is present but not in position 3? But we already knew from MOIST that I is not in position 3. Now we also know that I is not in position 3 (again, but we already knew) and also we learn that it's not in position 3? Actually, the feedback for I in BUILD is ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. But we already knew that from the previous guess.

Moreover, we now know that B, U, L, D are absent.

So combining all:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T, B, U, L, D

Present letters: I (but not in position 3, and now not in position 3 again? We still don't know where it is).

We have tested I in position 3 (MOIST) and position 3 (BUILD) — both times position 3? In MOIST, I was in position 3, and in BUILD, I was also in position 3? That was a mistake.

In MOIST: positions: M(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), T(5) -> I in position 3, feedback: I(-) meaning I is in the word but not in position 3.

In BUILD: positions: B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) -> again I in position 3, feedback: I(-) meaning again, I is in the word but not in position 3. This doesn't give new information about the position of I, only that it is still not in position 3.

But we already knew that. So we wasted a position? We should have put I in a different position.

Now we know that I is not in position 3, and we have no information about other positions because we haven't tried them.

Additionally, we have excluded many letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T, B, U, L, D.

So the available letters are: F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and I (which we know is present).

We must include I in the next guess, and we should try it in a position we haven't tried before. We have only tried position 3 so far. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also need to form a word with the available letters.

Let's list the available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that includes I and four of these letters.

Possible words:

- With I in position 1:
  - ""IGLOO"" -> but O and L are excluded -> invalid.
  - ""INKED"" -> N and E excluded -> invalid.
  - ""IVORY"" -> O and R excluded -> invalid.
  - ""ITCHY"" -> T and H? T excluded -> invalid.
  - ""INFER"" -> N, F, E, R -> N, E, R excluded -> invalid.

It's hard to find words with I in position 1 without using excluded letters.

- With I in position 2:
  - ""PIQUE"" -> P, I, Q, U, E -> U and E excluded -> invalid.
  - ""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E -> all excluded -> invalid.
  - ""KIOSK"" -> K, I, O, S, K -> O and S excluded -> invalid.
  - ""GIANT"" -> G, I, A, N, T -> A, N, T excluded -> invalid.

Also hard.

- With I in position 4:
  - ""SPRIG"" -> S, P, R, I, G -> S, R excluded -> invalid.
  - ""FLICK"" -> F, L, I, C, K -> L, C excluded -> invalid.
  - ""JUVIE"" -> J, U, V, I, E -> U, E excluded -> invalid.

- With I in position 5:
  - ""TAXI"" -> too short? We need 5 letters.
  - ""ALIBI"" -> A, L, I, B, I -> A, L, B excluded -> invalid.
  - ""RABBI"" -> R, A, B, B, I -> R, A, B excluded -> invalid.

This is difficult. We might need to use Y as a vowel.

Let's try words with Y.

For example, with I in position 1: ""IVORY"" -> O excluded.

With I in position 2: ""PYGMY"" -> P, Y, G, M, Y -> M excluded? M is excluded -> invalid.

With I in position 4: ""HAPPY"" -> H, A, P, P, Y -> A excluded -> invalid.

With I in position 5: ""FUNGI"" -> F, U, N, G, I -> U, N excluded -> invalid.

Another idea: ""PIETY"" -> P, I, E, T, Y -> E, T excluded -> invalid.

""WIMPY"" -> W, I, M, P, Y -> M excluded -> invalid.

""JIVED"" -> J, I, V, E, D -> E, D excluded -> invalid.

We are running out of options.

Perhaps we missed a letter? Available letters: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And we know I is in the word.

What about ""WHIZZ""? But that has double Z and is not common? Also, Z is not very common.

""JAZZY"" -> J, A, Z, Z, Y -> A excluded -> invalid.

""FUZZY"" -> F, U, Z, Z, Y -> U excluded -> invalid.

""JIFFY"" -> J, I, F, F, Y -> F and Y are available? Let's check: F is available, Y is available. But double F? That's acceptable.

""JIFFY"": J, I, F, F, Y.

Positions: J(1), I(2), F(3), F(4), Y(5)

We haven't tried I in position 2 before? We tried in position 3 twice, but not in 2.

So this word uses J, I, F, Y. And it has double F, but that's okay.

But we are testing F and Y, and J.

Is ""JIFFY"" a valid word? It means a short period of time, like ""in a jiffy"". Yes, it's acceptable.

And it doesn't use any excluded letters: excluded are C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S,T,B,U,L,D.

So J, I, F, Y are all allowed.

But we have two F's? That's fine, but we are testing F only once? Actually, we are testing F in position 3 and 4, but if the word has only one F, then one of them will be absent? But we don't know.

But it's a valid word.

Another word: ""PIZZY""? Not a word.

""ZIPPY"" -> Z, I, P, P, Y -> that's a word, meaning lively.

""ZIPPY"": Z, I, P, P, Y.

Positions: Z(1), I(2), P(3), P(4), Y(5)

Again, I in position 2.

Available letters: Z, I, P, Y are all allowed.

We haven't tested P or Z or Y.

So ""ZIPPY"" is also a candidate.

Another: ""JIFFY"" or ""ZIPPY"".

We can also consider ""KIWI"" but that's 4 letters.

""KIWIS"" -> S excluded -> invalid.

""WIZEN"" -> W, I, Z, E, N -> E, N excluded -> invalid.

So ""JIFFY"" and ""ZIPPY"" are candidates.

I think ""ZIPPY"" is more common? Or ""JIFFY"".

But let's choose one.

We can also consider ""FJORD"" but that has O and R? O and R excluded -> invalid.

Another word: ""QUIFF"" -> Q, U, I, F, F -> U excluded -> invalid.

""VIXEN"" -> V, I, X, E, N -> E, N excluded -> invalid.

So I think ""ZIPPY"" is a good choice.

But in ""ZIPPY"", we have I in position 2, which we haven't tried.

We can also try I in position 4 or 5.

For example, ""PUDGY"" but U and D excluded.

""GYPSY"" -> G, Y, P, S, Y -> S excluded -> invalid.

""LYMPH"" -> L, Y, M, P, H -> L, M excluded -> invalid.

So position 2 seems the easiest.

Another word: ""HIJAB"" -> H, I, J, A, B -> A and B excluded -> invalid.

""KIOSK"" -> O and S excluded.

So I think ""ZIPPY"" is acceptable.

But let's confirm the word: ZIPPY is a valid English word.

We'll guess ""ZIPPY"".

But note: we have two P's. If the secret word has only one P, then one of the P's might be marked as absent, but that's okay.

We are also testing Z, I, P, Y.

So let's go with ""ZIPPY"".

But we must include I, and we are including it in position 2.

If I is in position 2, we might get a match, or if not, then we know it's not in position 2.

We have only 3 guesses left? We are on guess 4.

After this, we have two more guesses.

So guess 4: ZIPPY.

But let's write it.The feedback from previous guesses reveals:
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T, B, U, L, D (all marked as `x`).
- **Present letter**: I (confirmed present but not in position 3, as per Guess 2 and Guess 3).
- **Available letters**: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **I's position constraints**: Since I was tested in position 3 twice (in ""MOIST"" and ""BUILD"") and was marked as `-` both times, it cannot be in position 3. It must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

For the next guess:
- I must be included to determine its correct position.
- I should be placed in a new position (not position 3) to gain new information. Position 2 is untested and common for I.
- The word should maximize new letter coverage using high-frequency available letters (e.g., P, Y, F, G) to narrow possibilities.
- ""ZIPPY"" is a strong choice:
  - Places I in position 2 (new position to test).
  - Uses new letters: Z, P, Y (P appears twice, testing for duplicates).
  - Avoids all excluded letters.

We haven\'t tried M, O, I, S, T.\n\n Another option: ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S. This introduces U.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels. However, since we know the word doesn\'t have A and E, it must have one or more of I, O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\n We can also consider ""LUMPS"" but that has U and M.\n\n After considering, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because:\n   - It uses common letters: M, O, I, S, T.\n   - It covers two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (M, S, T).\n\n Alternatively, ""PILOT"" is also good.\n\n But let me check: we are avoiding C, R, A, N, E. Both ""MOIST"" and ""PILOT"" are valid.\n\n I\'ll go with ""MOIST"" for the second guess.\n\n So the next guess is ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (all letters marked as absent: C, R, A, N, E), the secret word contains **none of these letters**. Therefore, I need a new guess that:\n- Excludes C, R, A, N, E entirely\n- Uses common letters to maximize information gain\n- Prioritizes high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, L, M) and untested vowels (O, I, U)\n\nThe word **""MOIST""** fits well:\n- Letters: M, O, I, S, T (all untested and common)\n- Covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T)\n- Avoids repeats and excluded letters\n\nThis guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities by testing new high-value letters.\n\n<guess>MOIST</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. CRANE: all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the word -> we know the secret word does not contain any of these letters.\n2. MOIST: M(x), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(x). This means:\n   - M is not in the word.\n   - O is not in the word.\n   - I is in the word but in the wrong position (since it\'s marked as -).\n   - S is not in the word.\n   - T is not in the word.\n\nSo, from guess 2, we know:\n- The letter I is present in the secret word, but not in the third position (since we guessed it in position 3 and it\'s wrong position).\n- The letters M, O, S, T are absent.\n\nCombining with the first guess, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.\n\nThe only letter we know is present is I, and it must be in a position other than the third.\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains I (but not in position 3) and does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.\n\nWe need to pick a new 5-letter word that:\n- Includes I (since we know it\'s in the word), and places it in a position other than 3.\n- Uses only letters not already excluded.\n- Includes other common letters to test more possibilities.\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe know I is in the word, so we must include it. We should try to place it in a different position: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).\n\nWe also want to test other common letters from the available set.\n\nCommon letters among the available ones: L, U, D, P, H, G, B, etc.\n\nGiven the constraints, we need a word that has I in one of positions 1,2,4,5 and uses other available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- With I in position 1: e.g., ""IGLOO"" but O is excluded? We cannot have O. Also, it has O which is excluded. So invalid.\n\nLet me think of words that fit:\n\n- Consider placing I in the first position?\n  Example: ""INPUT"" -> but U and P? Wait, but T is excluded -> T is excluded so we cannot use T.\n\nWe must avoid excluded letters.\n\nSome ideas:\n\n- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> I is in position 3, but we already know I is not in position 3? Actually, no: we have I in position 3 in MOIST and it was wrong position, meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So we can have I in position 3? No, feedback says I(-) and we placed it in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3 in the secret word. So we must avoid putting I in position 3 again? Actually, no, we can put it anywhere, but we must not put it in position 3 because we already know it\'s not there. But if we put it in position 3 again, the feedback would again say it\'s wrong position? Yes, but that doesn\'t give us new information. So it\'s better to try a different position.\n\nWe should try I in a position we haven\'t tried before to see if it is correct.\n\nSince the feedback for I in position 3 was wrong, the I must be in position 1,2,4, or 5.\n\nSo for the next guess, let\'s try I in position 1, for example.\n\nWord with I in position 1: \n  - ""IGLUS"" -> not common? Or ""IGLUS"" is not standard.\n  - ""INBOX"": but N is excluded (from first guess), so cannot.\n  - ""IMBUE"": M is excluded -> invalid.\n  - ""ILLUS"": not a word? ""ILLUS"" is not valid.\n\nAnother word: ""PICKY"" -> P, I, C, K, Y -> but C is excluded -> invalid.\n\nWhat about ""JUICE"": J, U, I, C, E -> but C and E are excluded -> invalid.\n\n""BILLY"": B, I, L, L, Y -> letters: B, I, L, Y. We have I and L? But L is available? Yes, and we haven\'t tested L.\n\nBut note: we can use L, but we have to avoid excluded letters. Also, ""BILLY"" has double L? But that\'s acceptable.\n\nHowever, we are testing new letters.\n\nAnother word: ""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> but doesn\'t include I? We must include I because we know it\'s in the word. So the guess must include I.\n\nImportant: we know I is in the word, so any guess without I would not be logical because we are trying to find the exact position and test other letters.\n\nSo the word must include I.\n\nNow, position: if we try I in position 1:\n\nPossible words: ""INLAY"" -> but N is excluded, A is excluded? A is excluded -> no.\n\n""IDLER"" -> but R is excluded -> no.\n\n""FISHY"" -> but S is excluded and H? S is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""LIGHT"": L, I, G, H, T -> T is excluded -> invalid.\n\nPosition 2: maybe better.\n\nWords with I in position 2: \n  - ""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> no excluded letters? B, U, I, L, D -> check: excluded are C,R,A,N,E,M,O,S,T. So BUILD: B,U,I,L,D are all allowed.\n  - ""GUILD"": G,U,I,L,D -> also valid.\n\nPosition 4: ""PLUGS"" -> but S excluded? And G and L? Actually, ""PLUGS"" has S -> excluded -> invalid.\n\nPosition 5: ""TULIP"" -> T excluded, invalid.\n\nSo let\'s consider words with I in position 2: BUILD or GUILD.\n\nBUILD: letters B,U,I,L,D\n\nGUILD: letters G,U,I,L,D\n\nBoth test U, L, D and either B or G.\n\nWhich one? We can choose one. Let me pick BUILD, for example.\n\nBut we can also consider words with I in position 1? There are fewer because many words with I in first position require vowels we have excluded? For example, ""IRATE"": has R and A, excluded. ""IMAGE"": has M and E? M excluded. ""ITCHY"": has T? excluded.\n\nActually, position 1 is hard.\n\nAnother word: ""QUICK"" but Q, C, K? C excluded.\n\n""WIMPY"": W,I,M,P,Y -> M excluded.\n\nSo words with I in position 2 seem feasible.\n\nAlternatively, I in position 4: \n  - ""HUMID"": H,U,M,I,D -> M excluded.\n  - ""VALID"": V,A,L,I,D -> A excluded.\n  - ""LUPIN"": but U,P,I,N -> N excluded? from first guess? Yes, N is excluded.\n\nPosition 5: ""FUNGI"": F,U,N,G,I -> N excluded.\n\nSo position 2 is decent.\n\nAnother position 2 word: ""BLIND"" -> L,I,N,D -> N excluded, invalid.\n\n""SKIMP"" -> S,K,I,M,P -> all excluded? S and M excluded -> invalid.\n\n""THICK"" -> T excluded and C excluded.\n\nSo BUILD and GUILD are good candidates.\n\nAlso, ""JUICY"" -> J,U,I,C,Y -> C excluded ? invalid.\n\n""QUILL"": Q,U,I,L,L -> that\'s Q,U,I,L. Double L? And we can test Q.\n\nBut I think BUILD or GUILD are better because they use more common letters.\n\nBetween BUILD and GUILD, we don\'t know which is better. We haven\'t tested B, G, U, L, D, so both are equal in information.\n\nBut we might prefer BUILD because B is slightly more common than G? Or GUILD because G might be more common? According to letter frequency in English words, B is more frequent than G? Actually, G is slightly more common than B, but not significantly.\n\nAnyway, let\'s pick one.\n\nAnother word: ""GUILT"" -> G,U,I,L,T -> but T is excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo BUILD seems good: B,U,I,L,D.\n\nGUILD: G,U,I,L,D.\n\nAlso, ""DUCHY"": D,U,C,H,Y -> C excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo BUILD or GUILD.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BUILD"".\n\nTherefore, third guess: BUILD.\n\nPlace I in position 2 (which is a new position) to see if it\'s correct.\n\nIf the I is in position 2, it might get ✓, or if not but in the word then -.\n\nWe expect either (if correct) I(✓) or if it\'s elsewhere then I(-) again.\n\nBut we also test B,U,L,D.\n\nNow, note: we know I is in the word, but when we guess BUILD, if I is in the secret word but not in position 2, then the feedback for I will be -, and we know it\'s not in position 2 either? It could be in position 1,3,4,5? But we already tried position 3 and it was -, so not there. Position 1,4,5 are still possible.\n\nBut secret word could have I only once? We don\'t know, but Wordle words are unique letters? Not necessary, they can have repeated letters? I think they can, like ""SISSY"", but in our feedback we are not showing duplicates explicitly.\n\nBut in BUILD, all letters are unique, and we are testing each.\n\nSo let\'s choose BUILD as the third guess.Based on the feedback:\n- **C, R, A, N, E** from Guess 1 (CRANE) are absent (all marked as `x`).\n- **M, O, S, T** from Guess 2 (MOIST) are absent (all marked as `x`).\n- **I** is present (marked as `-`), but not in position 3.\n\nTherefore:\n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T\n- **Present letter**: I (must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 of the secret word)\n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nStrategy:\n- Since I is confirmed, the new guess must include I (to test its position) and avoid excluded letters.\n- I should be placed in a new position (not position 3) to gather more information—ideally position 2 to test a common middle slot.\n- Focus on testing common consonants like L, D, and U to maximize information gain.\n- A strong candidate is ""BUILD"":\n  - Includes I in position 2 (new position to test).\n  - Uses four new common letters (B, U, L, D), covering multiple test cases efficiently.\n\n<guess>BUILD</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: BUILD -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(x) I(-) L(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.\nGuess 2: MOIST -> M, O, S, T absent; I present but in wrong position (not position 3).\nGuess 3: BUILD -> B, U, L, D absent; I present but in wrong position (not position 2, since we placed it in position 3?

Actually, the feedback for I in BUILD is ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in position 3.

That was a mistake.\n\nIn MOIST: positions: M(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), T(5) -> I in position 3, feedback: I(-) meaning I is in the word but not in position 3.\n\nIn BUILD: positions: B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) -> again I in position 3, feedback: I(-) meaning again, I is in the word but not in position 3.

That\'s fine, but we are testing F only once? Actually, we are testing F in position 3 and 4, but if the word has only one F, then one of them will be absent?

If the secret word has only one P, then one of the P\'s might be marked as absent, but that\'s okay.\n\nWe are also testing Z, I, P, Y.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""ZIPPY"".\n\nBut we must include I, and we are including it in position 2.\n\nIf I is in position 2, we might get a match, or if not, then we know it\'s not in position 2.\n\nWe have only 3 guesses left? We are on guess 4.\n\nAfter this, we have two more guesses.\n\nSo guess 4: ZIPPY.\n\nBut let\'s write it.The feedback from previous guesses reveals:\n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T, B, U, L, D (all marked as `x`).\n- **Present letter**: I (confirmed present but not in position 3, as per Guess 2 and Guess 3).\n- **Available letters**: F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- **I\'s position constraints**: Since I was tested in position 3 twice (in ""MOIST"" and ""BUILD"") and was marked as `-` both times, it cannot be in position 3. It must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- I must be included to determine its correct position.\n- I should be placed in a new position (not position 3) to gain new information. Position 2 is untested and common for I.\n- The word should maximize new letter coverage using high-frequency available letters (e.g., P, Y, F, G) to narrow possibilities.\n- ""ZIPPY"" is a strong choice:\n  - Places I in position 2 (new position to test).\n  - Uses new letters: Z, P, Y (P appears twice, testing for duplicates).\n  - Avoids all excluded letters.\n\n<guess>ZIPPY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: BUILD -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(x) I(-) L(x) D(x)\nGuess 4: ZIPPY -> FEEDBACK: Z(-) I(✓) P(x) P(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

1. CRANE: all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
2. MOIST: M, O, S, T absent; I present but not in position 3.
3. BUILD: B, U, L, D absent; I present but not in position 3 (again, but we already knew that).
4. ZIPPY: 
   - Z: present but not in position 1 (marked as -)
   - I: correct in position 2 (marked as ✓)
   - P: absent (both P's are marked x, so P is not in the word at all)
   - Y: correct in position 5 (marked as ✓)

So from ZIPPY:
- I is in position 2 (correct).
- Y is in position 5 (correct).
- Z is present but not in position 1.
- P is absent (so P is not in the word).

Also, from previous, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T, B, U, L, D, and now P.

And we know the word has Z (but not in position 1) and I in position 2 and Y in position 5.

So the secret word has the form: _ I _ _ Y

And it contains Z, but not in position 1.

Also, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T, B, U, L, D, P.

Available letters: F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z (and we know Z is present).

But we also have to consider that Z is present, so it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4? But position 1 is not possible because we guessed Z in position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position, so it cannot be in position 1. Therefore, Z must be in position 3 or 4.

Positions: 
1: unknown, but not Z (since Z is not in position 1, and we know it's present so it must be in 3 or 4)
2: I (fixed)
3: unknown
4: unknown
5: Y (fixed)

And Z must be in position 3 or 4.

Now, the word is: _ I (Z or ?) (Z or ?) Y

But Z can only be in one position, so either:
Option A: position 3 is Z, position 4 is something else
Option B: position 4 is Z, position 3 is something else

We need to find a word that fits: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] Y

With letter1, letter3, letter4 from the available letters: F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

But Z must be either letter3 or letter4.

Also, we have to use Z exactly once? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but in ZIPPY we had two P's and both were absent, so P is not in the word. Similarly, we haven't seen duplicates for other letters.

Now, let's list possible words.

First, if Z is in position 3: then the word is _ I Z _ Y

What can be in position 1 and 4?

Available: F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X (since Z is used)

And position 4 must be one of these.

Possible words:

- ""WIZZY"": W, I, Z, Z, Y -> but double Z? And is it a word? ""Wizzy"" is informal for wizardry or something, but let's see. Also, we have Z in position 3 and 4? But we only know one Z is present, but it could be two? However, in our guess, we only have one Z in ZIPPY? In ZIPPY, we had Z in position 1 and Y in 5, but not in other positions. We don't know if there are multiple Z's.

But ""WIZZY"" has two Z's. We can consider it.

But let's check the letters: W, I, Z, Z, Y. We have I and Y in correct positions. The Z in position 3 would be correct? But we don't know.

But we are trying to guess.

Other words: ""JIZZY""? Not a word.

""FIZZY"": F, I, Z, Z, Y -> ""fizzy"" is a word. And F is available.

So ""FIZZY"" is a candidate.

If Z is in position 4: then the word is _ I _ Z Y

What words? For example, ""WINDY"" but N and D excluded -> invalid.

""FISHY"" -> S excluded.

With available letters: position 1: F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X; position 3: F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X (but not Z, because if Z is in position 4, then position 3 is not Z); position 4: Z.

So words: _ I _ Z Y

Examples:
- ""FIGZY""? Not a word.
- ""JIGZY""? No.
- ""QUIZZY""? Q, U, I, Z, Z, Y -> but U excluded? U is excluded from BUILD -> invalid.
- ""WHIZY""? W, H, I, Z, Y -> but position 4 is Z, so it would be W, I, H, Z, Y? That's ""WIHZY"" not a word.

Actually, I can't think of any common word with the pattern _ I _ Z Y.

Another: ""DIZZY"" -> D excluded.

""BIZZY"" -> B excluded.

So probably Z is in position 3, and we have words like ""FIZZY"".

What about ""KIZZY""? Not common.

""GIZZY""? Not a word.

""ZIPPY"" we already tried, but P is excluded.

So ""FIZZY"" seems the most plausible.

But in ""FIZZY"", we have:
Position 1: F
Position 2: I (correct)
Position 3: Z
Position 4: Z
Position 5: Y (correct)

But we have two Z's. Is that possible? We know Z is present, but we don't know if it appears once or twice.

In the feedback for ZIPPY, we had Z in position 1 marked as present (but wrong position), and we have Y correct. But we don't have information about multiple Z's.

But in ""FIZZY"", if we guess it, we can see.

But we also have to consider that position 1 must be one of the available letters.

Another possibility: if Z is in position 3, and position 4 is not Z, then what words?

For example, ""WIFLY""? Not a word.

""FIZZY"" has Z in position 3 and 4.

What about ""JIVEY""? Not a word.

""HIVED"" -> H, I, V, E, D -> E and D excluded.

I think ""FIZZY"" is the only common word that fits.

But let's confirm: the word ""fizzy"" means having bubbles, like carbonated drink.

It is a valid 5-letter word.

We can also consider ""ZINCY"" but C excluded and N excluded? C and N are excluded.

No.

So I think ""FIZZY"" is the best guess.

But we have to make sure about the double Z.

In the feedback for ZIPPY, we had Z marked as present (but not position 1) and the two P's absent. We don't have information about whether Z can be duplicated, but it's possible.

Alternatively, is there a word with Z only once?

For example, with Z in position 3: _ I Z ? Y

What can ? be? It must be a letter from F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X.

Words: 
- ""FIZZY"" has double Z, so if we want single Z, then position 4 must be a different letter.

But what word? ""WIZEN"" -> E and N excluded.

""GIZMO"" -> O and M excluded.

""KIWIZ""? Not a word.

I cannot find any common word with pattern _ I Z ? Y without using excluded letters and with ? being one of the available.

Similarly, if Z is in position 4: _ I ? Z Y

What for ?: available letters.

Words: ""LIZZY"" -> L excluded.

""MIZZY"" -> M excluded.

""TIZZY"" -> T excluded.

""FIZZY"" is the only one without excluded letters? But ""FIZZY"" has Z in position 3 and 4.

Perhaps ""JAZZY"" but A and Z? A excluded.

So I think ""FIZZY"" is the only candidate.

Therefore, we should guess ""FIZZY"".

But note: in ""FIZZY"", we have:
- Position 1: F (which we haven't tested)
- Position 3: Z (we know Z is present, and if it's in position 3, it might be correct or not? We don't know the position of Z yet, only that it's not in 1)

If we guess ""FIZZY"", and if the secret word is ""FIZZY"", then we win.

If not, we get feedback.

But since we have only two guesses left (this is guess 5, and we have one more if needed), we can try.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

Another word: what about ""WHIZ"" but that's 4 letters.

Or ""WHIZY"" not a word.

""ZIPPY"" we already tried.

So I think ""FIZZY"" is the word.

But we must consider that in ""FIZZY"", position 4 is also Z. If the secret word has only one Z, then the second Z might be marked absent? But we'll see.

But given the constraints, it's the only common word.

So I'll go with ""FIZZY"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Excluded Letters**: C, R, A, N, E (Guess 1), M, O, S, T (Guess 2), B, U, L, D (Guess 3), P (Guess 4).  
  Total excluded: **C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T, B, U, L, D, P** (14 letters).
- **Confirmed Letters**:
  - **I** is in position 2 (✓ from Guess 4).
  - **Y** is in position 5 (✓ from Guess 4).
  - **Z** is present but not in position 1 (- from Guess 4).
- **Secret Word Structure**: `[?] I [?] [?] Y`  
  - Position 1: Unknown (cannot be Z, and must be from remaining letters).
  - Position 2: **I** (fixed).
  - Position 3: Unknown (could be Z or another letter).
  - Position 4: Unknown (could be Z or another letter).
  - Position 5: **Y** (fixed).
- **Z's Position**: Must be in position 3 or 4 (since it cannot be in 1, and positions 2/5 are fixed).
- **Available Letters**: F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z (Z is confirmed present).
- **Key Insight**: The only common 5-letter word fitting the constraints is **FIZZY**:
  - `F` (position 1, untested letter).
  - `I` (position 2, confirmed).
  - `Z` (position 3, tests if Z is here).
  - `Z` (position 4, tests if Z is duplicated or in this position).
  - `Y` (position 5, confirmed).

### Why ""FIZZY""?
- Tests **Z** in a new position (3 or 4) to resolve its location.
- Uses **F** (high-frequency remaining consonant) to check for presence.
- If ""FIZZY"" is incorrect, feedback will reveal:
  - Whether **Z** is in position 3 or 4 (via ✓ or -).
  - Whether **F** is present/absent.
  - Whether duplicate **Z** is possible.
- No other valid words fit the pattern (e.g., ""JAZZY"" has A, excluded; ""ZIPPY"" already tried).

<guess>FIZZY</guess>",FIZZY,"We have feedback from four guesses:

1. CRANE: all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
2. MOIST: M, O, S, T absent; I present but not in position 3.
3. BUILD: B, U, L, D absent; I present but not in position 3 (again, but we already knew that).
4. ZIPPY: 
   - Z: present but not in position 1 (marked as -)
   - I: correct in position 2 (marked as ✓)
   - P: absent (both P's are marked x, so P is not in the word at all)
   - Y: correct in position 5 (marked as ✓)

So from ZIPPY:
- I is in position 2 (correct).
- Y is in position 5 (correct).
- Z is present but not in position 1.
- P is absent (so P is not in the word).

Also, from previous, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T, B, U, L, D, and now P.

And we know the word has Z (but not in position 1) and I in position 2 and Y in position 5.

So the secret word has the form: _ I _ _ Y

And it contains Z, but not in position 1.

Also, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, S, T, B, U, L, D, P.

Available letters: F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z (and we know Z is present).

But we also have to consider that Z is present, so it must be in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 4? But position 1 is not possible because we guessed Z in position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position, so it cannot be in position 1. Therefore, Z must be in position 3 or 4.

Positions: 
1: unknown, but not Z (since Z is not in position 1, and we know it's present so it must be in 3 or 4)
2: I (fixed)
3: unknown
4: unknown
5: Y (fixed)

And Z must be in position 3 or 4.

Now, the word is: _ I (Z or ?) (Z or ?) Y

But Z can only be in one position, so either:
Option A: position 3 is Z, position 4 is something else
Option B: position 4 is Z, position 3 is something else

We need to find a word that fits: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] Y

With letter1, letter3, letter4 from the available letters: F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

But Z must be either letter3 or letter4.

Also, we have to use Z exactly once? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but in ZIPPY we had two P's and both were absent, so P is not in the word. Similarly, we haven't seen duplicates for other letters.

Now, let's list possible words.

First, if Z is in position 3: then the word is _ I Z _ Y

What can be in position 1 and 4?

Available: F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X (since Z is used)

And position 4 must be one of these.

Possible words:

- ""WIZZY"": W, I, Z, Z, Y -> but double Z? And is it a word? ""Wizzy"" is informal for wizardry or something, but let's see. Also, we have Z in position 3 and 4? But we only know one Z is present, but it could be two? However, in our guess, we only have one Z in ZIPPY? In ZIPPY, we had Z in position 1 and Y in 5, but not in other positions. We don't know if there are multiple Z's.

But ""WIZZY"" has two Z's. We can consider it.

But let's check the letters: W, I, Z, Z, Y. We have I and Y in correct positions. The Z in position 3 would be correct? But we don't know.

But we are trying to guess.

Other words: ""JIZZY""? Not a word.

""FIZZY"": F, I, Z, Z, Y -> ""fizzy"" is a word. And F is available.

So ""FIZZY"" is a candidate.

If Z is in position 4: then the word is _ I _ Z Y

What words? For example, ""WINDY"" but N and D excluded -> invalid.

""FISHY"" -> S excluded.

With available letters: position 1: F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X; position 3: F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X (but not Z, because if Z is in position 4, then position 3 is not Z); position 4: Z.

So words: _ I _ Z Y

Examples:
- ""FIGZY""? Not a word.
- ""JIGZY""? No.
- ""QUIZZY""? Q, U, I, Z, Z, Y -> but U excluded? U is excluded from BUILD -> invalid.
- ""WHIZY""? W, H, I, Z, Y -> but position 4 is Z, so it would be W, I, H, Z, Y? That's ""WIHZY"" not a word.

Actually, I can't think of any common word with the pattern _ I _ Z Y.

Another: ""DIZZY"" -> D excluded.

""BIZZY"" -> B excluded.

So probably Z is in position 3, and we have words like ""FIZZY"".

What about ""KIZZY""? Not common.

""GIZZY""? Not a word.

""ZIPPY"" we already tried, but P is excluded.

So ""FIZZY"" seems the most plausible.

But in ""FIZZY"", we have:
Position 1: F
Position 2: I (correct)
Position 3: Z
Position 4: Z
Position 5: Y (correct)

But we have two Z's. Is that possible? We know Z is present, but we don't know if it appears once or twice.

In the feedback for ZIPPY, we had Z in position 1 marked as present (but wrong position), and we have Y correct. But we don't have information about multiple Z's.

But in ""FIZZY"", if we guess it, we can see.

But we also have to consider that position 1 must be one of the available letters.

Another possibility: if Z is in position 3, and position 4 is not Z, then what words?

For example, ""WIFLY""? Not a word.

""FIZZY"" has Z in position 3 and 4.

What about ""JIVEY""? Not a word.

""HIVED"" -> H, I, V, E, D -> E and D excluded.

I think ""FIZZY"" is the only common word that fits.

But let's confirm: the word ""fizzy"" means having bubbles, like carbonated drink.

It is a valid 5-letter word.

We can also consider ""ZINCY"" but C excluded and N excluded? C and N are excluded.

No.

So I think ""FIZZY"" is the best guess.

But we have to make sure about the double Z.

In the feedback for ZIPPY, we had Z marked as present (but not position 1) and the two P's absent. We don't have information about whether Z can be duplicated, but it's possible.

Alternatively, is there a word with Z only once?

For example, with Z in position 3: _ I Z ? Y

What can ? be? It must be a letter from F,G,H,J,K,Q,V,W,X.

Words: 
- ""FIZZY"" has double Z, so if we want single Z, then position 4 must be a different letter.

But what word? ""WIZEN"" -> E and N excluded.

""GIZMO"" -> O and M excluded.

""KIWIZ""? Not a word.

I cannot find any common word with pattern _ I Z ? Y without using excluded letters and with ? being one of the available.

Similarly, if Z is in position 4: _ I ? Z Y

What for ?: available letters.

Words: ""LIZZY"" -> L excluded.

""MIZZY"" -> M excluded.

""TIZZY"" -> T excluded.

""FIZZY"" is the only one without excluded letters? But ""FIZZY"" has Z in position 3 and 4.

Perhaps ""JAZZY"" but A and Z? A excluded.

So I think ""FIZZY"" is the only candidate.

Therefore, we should guess ""FIZZY"".

But since we have only two guesses left (this is guess 5, and we have one more if needed), we can try.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

Another word: what about ""WHIZ"" but that's 4 letters.

Or ""WHIZY"" not a word.

""ZIPPY"" we already tried.

But given the constraints, it's the only common word.

So I'll go with ""FIZZY"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
