Okay, so I need to make a new guess based on the feedback from the first guess. The first word I guessed was ""crane"", and all letters got an ""x"", meaning none of them—C, R, A, N, E—are in the secret word. That's actually quite helpful, even though it might seem disappointing. It means I can eliminate those letters entirely from consideration. 

Now, knowing what letters to avoid, I'm thinking about what other common letters could be in the word. The vowels A and E are out, so I should focus on other vowels like I, O, U, and common consonants that weren't used. Letters like S, T, L, and others come to mind. A word that uses different vowels and consonants would be ideal.

I recall that ""ships"" is a word, but it has an S at the end and might be too common. Wait, no—I need to pick something with no repeated letters ideally, since duplicates might complicate feedback. How about ""spoil""? It uses S, P, O, I, L—all unique and include new letters. O and I are vowels, which can help narrow down possibilities. 

Alternatively, ""pious"" comes to mind, but that has S at the end too. Words like ""light"", ""might"", ""fight"" are options, but they share several letters. Since C, R, A, N, E are out, I should avoid words containing those. ""Light"" has L, I, G, H, T—all unused letters, so it has high potential. 

But maybe a word with O and U? Like ""round"", but ""round"" includes R and N, which are excluded. Oops, I have to stick to letters not in the excluded set. So R is out? Yes, from the first feedback. 

Okay, listing possible candidates: ""spoil"", ""plumb"", ""sight"", ""fight"", ""might"". Among these, ""spoil"" introduces S, P, O, I, L—all unguessed letters. It has good coverage and includes vowels and consonants. Seems solid. 

Alternatively, ""sound"" uses S, O, U, N, D—but N is excluded, so that won't work. N was in the first guess and got an x, so it's out. So ""sound"" is invalid. 

""Patch"" uses P, A, T, C, H—A and C are excluded, so that won't work either. 

So I think ""spoil"" is a safe choice—it introduces five completely new letters and covers diverse letters. 

Let's confirm: excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E. 

So ""spoil"": S is new, P is new, O is new, I is new, L is new. Perfect. 

I'll go with ""spoil"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)), we know the secret word contains **none of these letters**: **C, R, A, N, or E**. This means:
- **Vowels**: We must avoid A/E and focus on other vowels (e.g., I, O, U) or vowel-like consonants.
- **Consonants**: We need to prioritize other common English letters like S, T, L, P, M, etc.

For the next guess, I'll choose a word that:
1. Uses **all new letters**, avoiding C/R/A/N/E entirely.
2. Includes **high-frequency letters** (like S, T, L, O, I) to maximize information gain.
3. Balances vowels and consonants to test new possibilities.

A strong candidate is **""SPOIL""** because:
- It introduces **5 new letters**: **S, P, O, I, L**.
- It includes **two vowels (O, I)** and three consonants (S, P, L).
- **S** and **L** are among the most common English consonants, while **O/I** are common vowels.

We have two guesses with feedback:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""spoil"" -> S, P, O, L are not in the word, but I is in the word but in the wrong position.

From this, we know:
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, L.
- The letter I is present in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""spoil"" it was at the 4th and got a ""-"", meaning it's elsewhere).

So, the word must contain the letter I, and it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 is wrong).

We also know that the word is 5 letters and must be composed of letters not in the excluded set. The excluded letters are: A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S.

Remaining letters: We have to choose from the rest of the alphabet. Let's list the available letters:
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: I is already known to be in the word, so we must include it. Also, we have to form a valid English word.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes the letter I (but not in the 4th position, because in ""spoil"" it was at position 4 and was wrong position, so it must be in a different position).
- Uses only the available letters (so no A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S).

We also want to test other common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven't tried yet: T, U, D, H, M, etc.

Possible positions for I: Since it can't be in position 4, we can try it in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's think of words that have I and are made of the available letters.

For example:
- Words with I at the start: ""itchy"" -> but we have to check letters. I, T, C, H, Y. But C is excluded (from first guess). So not valid.
- Another: ""input"" -> but P and N are excluded.

We must avoid excluded letters.

Let's try words with I in the second position? For example, ""bight"" (meaning a bend or curve). Letters: B, I, G, H, T. All these are available (B, I, G, H, T not excluded). And I is in position 2.

But note: we don't know if the word has B, G, H, T, but they are available.

Another possibility: ""digit"" -> D, I, G, I, T. But we have two I's? The word ""digit"" has two I's? No, ""digit"" is D-I-G-I-T? Actually, it's D-I-G-I-T, so two I's? But the secret word might have two I's? We don't know. But in our feedback, we only know that at least one I is present. However, we must be cautious.

But let's check: ""digit"" has D, I, G, I, T. The excluded letters don't include D, G, T, and I is allowed. But we have to see if it's valid.

But we are not sure about the frequency. We might want to avoid repeating letters for now to get more information.

Alternatively, ""midst"" -> but S is excluded.

Another idea: ""light"" -> but L is excluded (from ""spoil"" feedback, L is x).

L is excluded.

Let's think of words without the excluded letters.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word that includes I and four other letters from this set.

Some words:
- ""FIGHT"": F, I, G, H, T. All available? F, I, G, H, T are not excluded. And I is in position 2.
- ""THIGH"": T, H, I, G, H. This has two H's? And I in position 3. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We can use it, but it might be less informative if there are duplicates.
- ""WIGHT"": W, I, G, H, T. (a mythical being). I in position 2.
- ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T. I in position 2.
- ""DIGHT"": D, I, G, H, T. (archaic word meaning to adorn). I in position 2.

But note: we don't know if the word has F, W, M, D, etc. But we are trying to test new letters.

We also have to consider that I might be in other positions.

For example, I in position 1: ""itchy"" is invalid because of C. ""inbox"" -> I, N, B, O, X. But N and O are excluded. ""input"" -> P excluded. So hard to find words with I in position 1 without excluded letters.

I in position 3: ""habit"" -> H, A, B, I, T. But A is excluded. ""orbit"" -> O and B? O excluded. ""posit"" -> P and S excluded. So difficult.

I in position 5: ""taxi"" is 4 letters. ""sushi"" -> S excluded. ""tutti"" -> T, U, T, T, I. But T is repeated. And U is available. But we can try.

But perhaps it's easier to try I in position 2.

So let's go with a word that has I in position 2 and uses other common available letters.

Common available letters: T, H, G, D, M, etc.

I think ""MIGHT"" is a good candidate because:
- It uses M, I, G, H, T. All new letters.
- It tests T and H which are common.

Alternatively, ""FIGHT"" is also good.

But we have to choose one. Let's pick ""MIGHT"".

We can also consider ""THUMB"" but that doesn't have I. We must include I.

Another word: ""DIZZY"" -> D, I, Z, Z, Y. But Z is uncommon and repeated. Not ideal.

""JIFFY"" -> J, I, F, F, Y. Repeated F.

So ""MIGHT"" seems solid.

But note: in ""spoil"", I was in position 4 and got a ""-"", meaning I is in the word but not at position 4. In ""MIGHT"", I is at position 2. That's a different position, so it's allowed.

We'll guess ""MIGHT"" and see the feedback.

<guess>might</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these letters are eliminated.
- **Guess 2: spoil** → Letters S, P, O, L are absent (x), and I is present but in the wrong position (-). This means:
  - The secret word **contains I**, but not in position 4 (since it was guessed there and marked wrong).
  - Eliminated letters now include: **A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S**.
  - Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- **Must include I** (since it's confirmed present), but **not in position 4**.
- Use **new, high-frequency letters** from the available set to maximize information (e.g., T, H, G, M, D).
- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize common English words.
- Given I must be repositioned, testing it in **position 2** (a common spot for I in 5-letter words) is a strong choice.

A good candidate is **""MIGHT""**:
- **M, I, G, H, T** → All letters are from the available set, and I is in position 2 (avoiding position 4).
- Tests common letters like T, H, and G, which haven't been tried yet.
- If I is correct in position 2, we'll get a ✓; if not, the feedback will help narrow its position further.

<guess>might</guess>",might,"We have two guesses with feedback:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""spoil"" -> S, P, O, L are not in the word, but I is in the word but in the wrong position.

From this, we know:
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, L.
- The letter I is present in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""spoil"" it was at the 4th and got a ""-"", meaning it's elsewhere).

So, the word must contain the letter I, and it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 is wrong).

We also know that the word is 5 letters and must be composed of letters not in the excluded set. The excluded letters are: A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S.

Remaining letters: We have to choose from the rest of the alphabet. Let's list the available letters:
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: I is already known to be in the word, so we must include it. Also, we have to form a valid English word.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes the letter I (but not in the 4th position, because in ""spoil"" it was at position 4 and was wrong position, so it must be in a different position).
- Uses only the available letters (so no A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S).

We also want to test other common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven't tried yet: T, U, D, H, M, etc.

Possible positions for I: Since it can't be in position 4, we can try it in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's think of words that have I and are made of the available letters.

For example:
- Words with I at the start: ""itchy"" -> but we have to check letters. I, T, C, H, Y. But C is excluded (from first guess). So not valid.
- Another: ""input"" -> but P and N are excluded.

We must avoid excluded letters.

Let's try words with I in the second position? For example, ""bight"" (meaning a bend or curve). Letters: B, I, G, H, T. All these are available (B, I, G, H, T not excluded). And I is in position 2.

But note: we don't know if the word has B, G, H, T, but they are available.

Another possibility: ""digit"" -> D, I, G, I, T. But we have two I's? The word ""digit"" has two I's? No, ""digit"" is D-I-G-I-T? Actually, it's D-I-G-I-T, so two I's? But the secret word might have two I's? We don't know. But in our feedback, we only know that at least one I is present. However, we must be cautious.

But let's check: ""digit"" has D, I, G, I, T. The excluded letters don't include D, G, T, and I is allowed. But we have to see if it's valid.

But we are not sure about the frequency. We might want to avoid repeating letters for now to get more information.

Alternatively, ""midst"" -> but S is excluded.

Another idea: ""light"" -> but L is excluded (from ""spoil"" feedback, L is x).

L is excluded.

Let's think of words without the excluded letters.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word that includes I and four other letters from this set.

Some words:
- ""FIGHT"": F, I, G, H, T. All available? F, I, G, H, T are not excluded. And I is in position 2.
- ""THIGH"": T, H, I, G, H. This has two H's? And I in position 3. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We can use it, but it might be less informative if there are duplicates.
- ""WIGHT"": W, I, G, H, T. (a mythical being). I in position 2.
- ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T. I in position 2.
- ""DIGHT"": D, I, G, H, T. (archaic word meaning to adorn). I in position 2.

But note: we don't know if the word has F, W, M, D, etc. But we are trying to test new letters.

We also have to consider that I might be in other positions.

For example, I in position 1: ""itchy"" is invalid because of C. ""inbox"" -> I, N, B, O, X. But N and O are excluded. ""input"" -> P excluded. So hard to find words with I in position 1 without excluded letters.

I in position 3: ""habit"" -> H, A, B, I, T. But A is excluded. ""orbit"" -> O and B? O excluded. ""posit"" -> P and S excluded. So difficult.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word that covers common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Okay, so I need to make a new guess based on the feedback from the first guess. The first word I guessed was ""crane"", and all letters got an ""x"", meaning none of them—C, R, A, N, E—are in the secret word. That's actually quite helpful, even though it might seem disappointing. It means I can eliminate those letters entirely from consideration. 

Now, knowing what letters to avoid, I'm thinking about what other common letters could be in the word. The vowels A and E are out, so I should focus on other vowels like I, O, U, and common consonants that weren't used. Letters like S, T, L, and others come to mind. A word that uses different vowels and consonants would be ideal.

I recall that ""ships"" is a word, but it has an S at the end and might be too common. Wait, no—I need to pick something with no repeated letters ideally, since duplicates might complicate feedback. How about ""spoil""? It uses S, P, O, I, L—all unique and include new letters. O and I are vowels, which can help narrow down possibilities. 

Alternatively, ""pious"" comes to mind, but that has S at the end too. Words like ""light"", ""might"", ""fight"" are options, but they share several letters. Since C, R, A, N, E are out, I should avoid words containing those. ""Light"" has L, I, G, H, T—all unused letters, so it has high potential. 

But maybe a word with O and U? Like ""round"", but ""round"" includes R and N, which are excluded. Oops, I have to stick to letters not in the excluded set. So R is out? Yes, from the first feedback. 

Okay, listing possible candidates: ""spoil"", ""plumb"", ""sight"", ""fight"", ""might"". Among these, ""spoil"" introduces S, P, O, I, L—all unguessed letters. It has good coverage and includes vowels and consonants. Seems solid. 

Alternatively, ""sound"" uses S, O, U, N, D—but N is excluded, so that won't work. N was in the first guess and got an x, so it's out. So ""sound"" is invalid. 

""Patch"" uses P, A, T, C, H—A and C are excluded, so that won't work either. 

So I think ""spoil"" is a safe choice—it introduces five completely new letters and covers diverse letters. 

Let's confirm: excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E. 

So ""spoil"": S is new, P is new, O is new, I is new, L is new. Perfect. 

I'll go with ""spoil"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)), we know the secret word contains **none of these letters**: **C, R, A, N, or E**. This means:
- **Vowels**: We must avoid A/E and focus on other vowels (e.g., I, O, U) or vowel-like consonants.
- **Consonants**: We need to prioritize other common English letters like S, T, L, P, M, etc.

For the next guess, I'll choose a word that:
1. Uses **all new letters**, avoiding C/R/A/N/E entirely.
2. Includes **high-frequency letters** (like S, T, L, O, I) to maximize information gain.
3. Balances vowels and consonants to test new possibilities.

A strong candidate is **""SPOIL""** because:
- It introduces **5 new letters**: **S, P, O, I, L**.
- It includes **two vowels (O, I)** and three consonants (S, P, L).
- **S** and **L** are among the most common English consonants, while **O/I** are common vowels.

After submitting **""SPOIL""**, we'll use the feedback to narrow down possibilities further.

But note: we don't know if the word has F, W, M, D, etc. But we are trying to test new letters.

We also have to consider that I might be in other positions.

For example, I in position 1: ""itchy"" is invalid because of C. ""inbox"" -> I, N, B, O, X. But N and O are excluded. ""input"" -> P excluded. So hard to find words with I in position 1 without excluded letters.

Perfect. \n\nI\'ll go with ""spoil"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)), we know the secret word contains **none of these letters**: **C, R, A, N, or E**. This means:\n- **Vowels**: We must avoid A/E and focus on other vowels (e.g., I, O, U) or vowel-like consonants.\n- **Consonants**: We need to prioritize other common English letters like S, T, L, P, M, etc.\n\nFor the next guess, I\'ll choose a word that:\n1. Uses **all new letters**, avoiding C/R/A/N/E entirely.\n2. Includes **high-frequency letters** (like S, T, L, O, I) to maximize information gain.\n3. Balances vowels and consonants to test new possibilities.\n\nA strong candidate is **""SPOIL""** because:\n- It introduces **5 new letters**: **S, P, O, I, L**.\n- It includes **two vowels (O, I)** and three consonants (S, P, L).\n- **S** and **L** are among the most common English consonants, while **O/I** are common vowels.\n\nAfter submitting **""SPOIL""**, we\'ll use the feedback to narrow down possibilities further.\n\n<guess>spoil</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spoil -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) I(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses with feedback:\n1.

Also, we have to form a valid English word.\n\nWe need to make a new guess that:\n- Includes the letter I (but not in the 4th position, because in ""spoil"" it was at position 4 and was wrong position, so it must be in a different position).\n- Uses only the available letters (so no A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S).\n\nWe also want to test other common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven\'t tried yet: T, U, D, H, M, etc.\n\nPossible positions for I: Since it can\'t be in position 4, we can try it in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have I and are made of the available letters.\n\nFor example:\n- Words with I at the start: ""itchy"" -> but we have to check letters. I, T, C, H, Y. But C is excluded (from first guess). So not valid.\n- Another: ""input"" -> but P and N are excluded.\n\nWe must avoid excluded letters.\n\nLet\'s try words with I in the second position? For example, ""bight"" (meaning a bend or curve). Letters: B, I, G, H, T. All these are available (B, I, G, H, T not excluded). And I is in position 2.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has B, G, H, T, but they are available.\n\nAnother possibility: ""digit"" -> D, I, G, I, T. But we have two I\'s? The word ""digit"" has two I\'s? No, ""digit"" is D-I-G-I-T? Actually, it\'s D-I-G-I-T, so two I\'s? But the secret word might have two I\'s? We don\'t know. But in our feedback, we only know that at least one I is present. However, we must be cautious.\n\nBut let\'s check: ""digit"" has D, I, G, I, T. The excluded letters don\'t include D, G, T, and I is allowed. But we have to see if it\'s valid.\n\nBut we are not sure about the frequency. We might want to avoid repeating letters for now to get more information.\n\nAlternatively, ""midst"" -> but S is excluded.\n\nAnother idea: ""light"" -> but L is excluded (from ""spoil"" feedback, L is x).\n\nL is excluded.\n\nLet\'s think of words without the excluded letters.\n\nAvailable: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need a word that includes I and four other letters from this set.\n\nSome words:\n- ""FIGHT"": F, I, G, H, T. All available? F, I, G, H, T are not excluded. And I is in position 2.\n- ""THIGH"": T, H, I, G, H. This has two H\'s? And I in position 3. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. We can use it, but it might be less informative if there are duplicates.\n- ""WIGHT"": W, I, G, H, T. (a mythical being). I in position 2.\n- ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T. I in position 2.\n- ""DIGHT"": D, I, G, H, T. (archaic word meaning to adorn). I in position 2.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has F, W, M, D, etc. But we are trying to test new letters.\n\nWe also have to consider that I might be in other positions.\n\nFor example, I in position 1: ""itchy"" is invalid because of C. ""inbox"" -> I, N, B, O, X. But N and O are excluded. ""input"" -> P excluded. So hard to find words with I in position 1 without excluded letters.\n\nI in position 3: ""habit"" -> H, A, B, I, T. But A is excluded. ""orbit"" -> O and B? O excluded. ""posit"" -> P and S excluded. So difficult.\n\nI in position 5: ""taxi"" is 4 letters. ""sushi"" -> S excluded. ""tutti"" -> T, U, T, T, I. But T is repeated. And U is available. But we can try.\n\nBut perhaps it\'s easier to try I in position 2.\n\nSo let\'s go with a word that has I in position 2 and uses other common available letters.\n\nCommon available letters: T, H, G, D, M, etc.\n\nI think ""MIGHT"" is a good candidate because:\n- It uses M, I, G, H, T. All new letters.\n- It tests T and H which are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""FIGHT"" is also good.\n\nBut we have to choose one. Let\'s pick ""MIGHT"".\n\nWe can also consider ""THUMB"" but that doesn\'t have I. We must include I.\n\nAnother word: ""DIZZY"" -> D, I, Z, Z, Y. But Z is uncommon and repeated. Not ideal.\n\n""JIFFY"" -> J, I, F, F, Y. Repeated F.\n\nSo ""MIGHT"" seems solid.\n\nBut note: in ""spoil"", I was in position 4 and got a ""-"", meaning I is in the word but not at position 4. In ""MIGHT"", I is at position 2. That\'s a different position, so it\'s allowed.\n\nWe\'ll guess ""MIGHT"" and see the feedback.\n\n<guess>might</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these letters are eliminated.\n- **Guess 2: spoil** → Letters S, P, O, L are absent (x), and I is present but in the wrong position (-).

We have three guesses with feedback:
1. ""crane"" -> All letters incorrect: C, R, A, N, E are absent.
2. ""spoil"" -> S, P, O, L absent; I is present but not in position 4.
3. ""might"" -> M, G, H absent; I is correct in position 2; T is present but not in position 5.

So, summarizing:
- **Definitely in the word**: I (specifically in position 2, since we got a ✓ for it in guess 3).
- **Letters present but position wrong**: T (from guess 3, T is in the word but not in position 5).
- **Eliminated letters**: A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S, M, G, H. (From guess 1 and 2, plus M, G, H from guess 3.)

Eliminated letters: A, C, E, G, H, L, M, N, O P, R, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, I, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: I is fixed in position 2, and T must be included somewhere but not in position 5.

Current knowledge:
- Position 2 is I (from the ✓ in guess 3).
- T is in the word, but not at position 5 (since in ""might"" at position 5 it was marked ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).

The word structure: _ I _ _ _

T can be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is wrong, and position 2 is taken by I).

We need to make a guess that:
- Has I in position 2.
- Includes T (which must be in position 1, 3, or 4).
- Uses only available letters: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word that fits.

Possible words? Let's think of words with structure: [T?] I [letter?] [letter?] [T?] — but T can't be in position 5, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Options:
- T in position 1: T I _ _ _
- T in position 3: _ I T _ _
- T in position 4: _ I _ T _

We also need to use new letters to test possibilities.

Given the available letters, let's consider:
- For T in position 1: ""TI..."" words? Examples: TIGER -> but G and E are eliminated. TIDAL -> D and A, but A eliminated. TIBIA -> B and I again? TIBIA has B and I, but position 4 is A -> eliminated. So hard.

Available: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Therefore, words must be formed from these letters.

Possibilities:
With T in position 1:
- ""TIGER"" not possible (G,E out).
- ""TIDAL"" not (A out).
- ""TIPSY"" -> T,I,P,S,Y. But P and S out. Invalid.
- ""TIZZY"" -> T,I,Z,Z,Y. Letters: T, I, Z, Z, Y. Available? Z and Y are available, but we have two Z's. Word ""tizzy"" means a state of agitation. It uses T, I, Z, Z, Y. So the second Z would duplicate? But we can use it. However, we are trying to test letters, and duplicate might limit information. But acceptable.

But we have eliminated letters: we must avoid P, S, etc.

Another: ""TICKY"" -> C and K? C is out. No.

""TIMED"" -> M,E,D -> M and E out.

""TIMID"" -> M and D; M out.

Available consonants: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So for T I _ _ _, we need valid letters. What about: ""TIKI"" is 4 letters? No. ""TILDE"" -> T,I,L,D,E -> L and E out.

Struggling with T in position 1.

Now T in position 3: _ I T _ _

Possible words: ""BIT TY""? Not. ""CITY"" too short. ""DITTY"" -> D,I,T,T,Y -> letters D,I,T,T,Y. Available? D, T, Y are available. ""Ditty"" is a 5-letter word meaning a short song. Positions: B1=I? Wait, word is D-I-T-T-Y, so position 3 is T, which is good. But we have two T's? The T at position 3 is fixed? No, in the word, position 3 is T and position 4 is T? So two T's.

But we know T is present, and if there are two T's, it's possible.

Similarly, ""BITT Y"" is two words? ""Bitty"" is a word meaning small. But ""bitty"" is B-I-T-T-Y -> positions 1:B, 2:I, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y. So same as above.

Again, duplicates.

""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> same letters.

""PITHY"" -> P is out.

So words like ""ditty"", ""bitty"", ""kitty"", ""witty"" (W,I,T,T,Y) — W is available, so ""witty"" could work.

But we have duplicates of T? Not necessarily a problem, but note that in feedback, we might get multiple marks.

But in guess 3, we have T only once, and it was marked ""-"", meaning at least one T is present. There could be more.

But to avoid duplicates for more information? We don't have to.

Another possibility: T in position 4: _ I _ T _

Words: ""QUI T T"" is ""quits"" would be Q,U,I,T,S but S out. ""QUIET"" -> Q,U,I,E,T -> E out. ""UNI T Y"" -> U,N,I,T,Y -> N out. So difficult.

We need to use the available letters.

Perhaps less common words: ""JIVED"" -> J,I,V,E,D -> E out. ""FIBER"" -> not. 

Since T is involved, and we need to place it elsewhere.

Perhaps ""DIZZY"" -> D,I,Z,Z,Y. But no T. But we need to include T because it is known to be present. So we must include T.

The word must contain T.

So missing T is not an option.

Therefore, consider the possibilities above.

Perhaps T in position 1 with available letters: ""TIKKA"" -> T,I,K,K,A -> A out. ""TWIXT"" -> T,W,I,X,T -> positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:X, 4:T? Or T,W,I,X,T? That's 5 letters? ""Twix T"" is two words? Actually, 'twixt is short for betwixt, but usually written with apostrophe. Not a standard 5-letter word. Probably not valid.

Another idea: ""DUVET"" -> D,U,V,E,T -> E out.

Let's think differently.

For position 1, we can put other available letters: B, D, F, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And include T in position 3 or 4.

For example:
- Word with position structure: _ I T _ _
  - Options: ""BIT TY"" = ""bitty"" -> B,I,T,T,Y -> letters: B, I, T, T, Y. Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y. Feedback: T is in position 3? And also position 4? We know T is present, but we don't know if multiple. However, we are testing.
- ""DITTY"" -> D,I,T,T,Y -> similar.

But ""ditty"" is D-I-T-T-Y. So T is in positions 3 and 4? That might be okay.

- ""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> K in position 1, T in 3 and 4.
- ""WITTY"" -> W,I,T,T,Y -> same.

Which one to choose? We need to test new letters.

""WITTY"" uses W (which we haven't tested) and Y.

Alternatively, to test different sets, let's pick ""BITTY"" because B is a common letter? But ""bitty"" might be less common, but it's accepted in Wordle.

Or ""DITTY""? D is common.

But we also have position 5 to consider.

Another word without duplicate: Is there a word with only one T?
For T in position 3: Structure _ I T _ _ 
Possible words with no duplicate letters.

""JITNEY"" too long? No, 5 letters? J-I-T-N-E-Y? 6 letters. Short words: ""CITY"" not 5. ""PITHY"" out due to P/H? H is eliminated? From guess 3, H is marked x in ""might"", so H is out.

H is eliminated.

Available letters: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Searching: ""BIGHT"" -> B,I,G,H,T -> G and H are both eliminated? From guess 3, G and H are x. So out.

""FIGHT"" -> F,I,G,H,T -> G and H out.

""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> duplicate T.

Similarly, ""DITTO"" -> O out.

""MITTS"" -> M and S out.

So it seems hard to find words without duplicates or without eliminated letters for the structure.

T in position 4: _ I _ T _
Possible words: ""QUI T E"" -> E out. ""QUI T S"" -> S out. ""DAILY"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> A and L out. ""DIET T"" -> D,I,E,T,T -> E out. ""PIETY"" -> P and E out.

""MINTY"" -> M and N out.

So the only feasible words seem to be with T in position 3 and another letter, but using duplicates? Or T in position 1 with less common combinations.

Try ""TIPSY"" -> but P and S out.

Perhaps ""TWIXT"" isn't valid. Let's find accepted words.

Another possibility: ""OUIJA"" -> O out. ""ADIEU"" -> A,E out.

What about ""BUY T"" not, ""JUST T"" not.

Let's consider that T might be in position 1 after all: ""TOUZY"" - not common. ""TAWNY"" - A and W? ""A"" eliminated. ""TUNNY"" - U,N,N,Y -> N out.

Not good.

Perhaps we missed a word: ""TWI T Y"" - 6 letters.

Or ""TAFFY"" -> T,A,F,F,Y -> A out.

Another idea: ""TU Y"" no.

We need to include U or other vowels.

Available vowels: Only left? U might be, Y is sometimes vowel.

""QUILL"" -> Q,U,I,L,L -> L out.

""BUILD"" -> B,U,I,L,D -> L out.

T is required.

Perhaps ""DUTY I"" no.

Let's list possible words:

With I fixed at position 2 and T included, and no eliminated letters:

- ""BITTY"" (B,I,T,T,Y) - valid
- ""DITTY"" (D,I,T,T,Y) - valid
- ""KITTY"" (K,I,T,T,Y) - valid
- ""WITTY"" (W,I,T,T,Y) - valid
- ""TITTY"" - not meaning, or offensive.

Also ""PIT T Y"" but P out.

So among B,D,K,W, which letters to test?

Since D and B are more common, we might choose ""DITTY"" or ""BITTY"".

""WITTY"" uses W, which is less common.

But we are trying to get information. ""DITTY"" uses D and Y, both new.

Similarly, ""KITTY"" uses K and Y.

To maximize new letters, let's pick ""DITTY"" because D is more flexible than K or W.

But we have duplicate T, so we know T is present, but feedback might not tell us how many if both T's are incorrect position or something.

In ""DITTY"", the T at position 3 and 4. But we know T is at least present, but in the secret word, it might be at position 1 or elsewhere? But in our structure, position 2 is I, so secret word is _ I _ _ _, so T could be at 1,3,4.

In ""DITTY"", if we have T at 3 and 4, but if the secret word has T at position 1, for example, then the T we see might only be placed at position 1, and we get feedback accordingly.

Similarly, if secret word has T at position 3, our T at 3 might be ✓, etc.

So we can try it.

Perhaps ""TAWPY"" -> not a word? ""JAW T Y"" no.

""JUICED"" -> J,U,I,C,E -> C and E out.

Not found other words.

Therefore, we go with ""DITTY"".

But ""ditty"" has two T's, but we are testing.

To be safe, we can use ""WITTY"" to test W, but B is perhaps more common.

But D is letter.

So let's choose ""BITTY"" or ""DITTY"". I'll pick ""dITTY"" with first letter D.

No, ""DITTY"" starts with D.

Or to include more unique letters, ""QUIP T"" not.

Another word: ""FU T Z Y""? But Z and Y? ""FUTZY"" is not common? ""Futzy"" might be slang. Probably not accepted.

""TA V V Y"" no.

So stick with the realistic ones.

We'll guess ""DITTY"".

But note the feedback may be messy with duplicates, but it's permissible.

</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters absent (x), eliminating **C, R, A, N, E**.
- **Guess 2: spoil** → **S, P, O, L** absent (x), **I** present but wrong position (-). This confirms the word contains **I**, but not in position 4.
- **Guess 3: might** → **M, G, H** absent (x), **I** correct in position 2 (✓), **T** present but wrong position (-). This confirms:
  - Position 2 is **I**.
  - The word contains **T**, but not in position 5.

### Current knowledge:
- **Fixed position**: Position 2 is **I** → Word structure: `[ ? ] I [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ]`.
- **Confirmed present letters**: **I** (position 2), **T** (somewhere not position 5).
- **Eliminated letters**: **A, C, E, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, R, S** (from all feedback).
- **Available letters**: **B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.
- **Constraints**:
  - **T** must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is taken and position 5 is wrong).
  - Must include **T**.

### Strategy:
- Focus on **T** placement: Test **T** in position 3 or 4 (position 1 is less feasible with available letters).
- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., **D, Y, B, W**).
- Consider common word patterns. Words like **BITTY**, **DITTY**, or **WITTY** fit the structure but may have duplicate letters (e.g., double **T**). Feedback will still provide valuable positional insights.
- Choose **DITTY** as the next guess:
  - Structure: **D I T T Y**
    - Position 1: **D** (new letter, tests common consonant).
    - Position 2: **I** (correct, confirmed).
    - Position 3: **T** (tests position 3).
    - Position 4: **T** (duplicate **T**, tests position 4).
    - Position 5: **Y** (new letter, tests common vowel-sound).
  - **DITTY** is a valid English word (meaning a short, simple song).
  - Tests **T** in both position 3 and 4 efficiently, while introducing **D** and **Y**.

We also need to use new letters to test possibilities.

Now T in position 3: _ I T _ _

Possible words: ""BIT TY""? Not. ""CITY"" too short. ""DITTY"" -> D,I,T,T,Y -> letters D,I,T,T,Y. Available? D, T, Y are available. ""Ditty"" is a 5-letter word meaning a short song. Positions: B1=I? Wait, word is D-I-T-T-Y, so position 3 is T, which is good. But we have two T's? The T at position 3 is fixed? No, in the word, position 3 is T and position 4 is T? So two T's.

But we know T is present, and if there are two T's, it's possible.

Similarly, ""BITT Y"" is two words? ""Bitty"" is a word meaning small. But ""bitty"" is B-I-T-T-Y -> positions 1:B, 2:I, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y. So same as above.

Again, duplicates.

""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> same letters.

""PITHY"" -> P is out.

So words like ""ditty"", ""bitty"", ""kitty"", ""witty"" (W,I,T,T,Y) — W is available, so ""witty"" could work.

But we have duplicates of T? Not necessarily a problem, but note that in feedback, we might get multiple marks.

But in guess 3, we have T only once, and it was marked ""-"", meaning at least one T is present. There could be more.

But to avoid duplicates for more information? We don't have to.

Another possibility: T in position 4: _ I _ T _

Words: ""QUI T T"" is ""quits"" would be Q,U,I,T,S but S out. ""QUIET"" -> Q,U,I,E,T -> E out. ""UNI T Y"" -> U,N,I,T,Y -> N out. So difficult.

We need to use the available letters.

Perhaps less common words: ""JIVED"" -> J,I,V,E,D -> E out. ""FIBER"" -> not. 

Since T is involved, and we need to place it elsewhere.

Perhaps ""DIZZY"" -> D,I,Z,Z,Y. But no T. But we need to include T because it is known to be present. So we must include T.

The word must contain T.

So missing T is not an option.

Therefore, consider the possibilities above.

Perhaps T in position 1 with available letters: ""TIKKA"" -> T,I,K,K,A -> A out. ""TWIXT"" -> T,W,I,X,T -> positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:X, 4:T? Or T,W,I,X,T? That's 5 letters? ""Twix T"" is two words? Actually, 'twixt is short for betwixt, but usually written with apostrophe. Not a standard 5-letter word. Probably not valid.

Another idea: ""DUVET"" -> D,U,V,E,T -> E out.

Let's think differently.

For position 1, we can put other available letters: B, D, F, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And include T in position 3 or 4.

For example:
- Word with position structure: _ I T _ _
  - Options: ""BIT TY"" = ""bitty"" -> B,I,T,T,Y -> letters: B, I, T, T, Y. Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y. Feedback: T is in position 3? And also position 4? We know T is present, but we don't know if multiple. However, we are testing.
- ""DITTY"" -> D,I,T,T,Y -> similar.

But ""ditty"" is D-I-T-T-Y. So T is in positions 3 and 4? That might be okay.

- ""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> K in position 1, T in 3 and 4.
- ""WITTY"" -> W,I,T,T,Y -> same.

Which one to choose? We need to test new letters.

""WITTY"" uses W (which we haven't tested) and Y.

Alternatively, to test different sets, let's pick ""BITTY"" because B is a common letter? But ""bitty"" might be less common, but it's accepted in Wordle.

Or ""DITTY""? D is common.

But we also have position 5 to consider.

Another word without duplicate: Is there a word with only one T?
For T in position 3: Structure _ I T _ _ 
Possible words with no duplicate letters.

""JITNEY"" too long? No, 5 letters? J-I-T-N-E-Y? 6 letters. Short words: ""CITY"" not 5. ""PITHY"" out due to P/H? H is eliminated? From guess 3, H is marked x in ""might"", so H is out.

H is eliminated.

Available letters: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Searching: ""BIGHT"" -> B,I,G,H,T -> G and H are both eliminated? From guess 3, G and H are x. So out.

""FIGHT"" -> F,I,G,H,T -> G and H out.

""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> duplicate T.

Similarly, ""DITTO"" -> O out.

""MITTS"" -> M and S out.

So it seems hard to find words without duplicates or without eliminated letters for the structure.

T in position 4: _ I _ T _
Possible words: ""QUI T E"" -> E out. ""QUI T S"" -> S out. ""DAILY"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> A and L out. ""DIET T"" -> D,I,E,T,T -> E out. ""PIETY"" -> P and E out.

""MINTY"" -> M and N out.

So the only feasible words seem to be with T in position 3 and another letter, but using duplicates? Or T in position 1 with less common combinations.

Try ""TIPSY"" -> but P and S out.

Perhaps ""TWIXT"" isn't valid. Let's find accepted words.

Another possibility: ""OUIJA"" -> O out. ""ADIEU"" -> A,E out.

What about ""BUY T"" not, ""JUST T"" not.

Let's consider that T might be in position 1 after all: ""TOUZY"" - not common. ""TAWNY"" - A and W? ""A"" eliminated. ""TUNNY"" - U,N,N,Y -> N out.

Not good.

Perhaps we missed a word: ""TWI T Y"" - 6 letters.

Or ""TAFFY"" -> T,A,F,F,Y -> A out.

Another idea: ""TU Y"" no.

We need to include U or other vowels.

Available vowels: Only left? U might be, Y is sometimes vowel.

""QUILL"" -> Q,U,I,L,L -> L out.

""BUILD"" -> B,U,I,L,D -> L out.

T is required.

Perhaps ""DUTY I"" no.

Let's list possible words:

With I fixed at position 2 and T included, and no eliminated letters:

- ""BITTY"" (B,I,T,T,Y) - valid
- ""DITTY"" (D,I,T,T,Y) - valid
- ""KITTY"" (K,I,T,T,Y) - valid
- ""WITTY"" (W,I,T,T,Y) - valid
- ""TITTY"" - not meaning, or offensive.

Also ""PIT T Y"" but P out.

So among B,D,K,W, which letters to test?

Since D and B are more common, we might choose ""DITTY"" or ""BITTY"".

""WITTY"" uses W, which is less common.

But we are trying to get information. ""DITTY"" uses D and Y, both new.

Similarly, ""KITTY"" uses K and Y.

To maximize new letters, let's pick ""DITTY"" because D is more flexible than K or W.

But we have duplicate T, so we know T is present, but feedback might not tell us how many if both T's are incorrect position or something.

In ""DITTY"", the T at position 3 and 4. But we know T is at least present, but in the secret word, it might be at position 1 or elsewhere? But in our structure, position 2 is I, so secret word is _ I _ _ _, so T could be at 1,3,4.

In ""DITTY"", if we have T at 3 and 4, but if the secret word has T at position 1, for example, then the T we see might only be placed at position 1, and we get feedback accordingly.

Similarly, if secret word has T at position 3, our T at 3 might be ✓, etc.

So we can try it.

Perhaps ""TAWPY"" -> not a word? ""JAW T Y"" no.

""JUICED"" -> J,U,I,C,E -> C and E out.

Not found other words.

Therefore, we go with ""DITTY"".

But ""ditty"" has two T's, but we are testing.

To be safe, we can use ""WITTY"" to test W, but B is perhaps more common.

But D is letter.

So let's choose ""BITTY"" or ""DITTY"". I'll pick ""dITTY"" with first letter D.

No, ""DITTY"" starts with D.

Or to include more unique letters, ""QUIP T"" not.

Another word: ""FU T Z Y""? But Z and Y? ""FUTZY"" is not common? ""Futzy"" might be slang. Probably not accepted.

""TA V V Y"" no.

So stick with the realistic ones.

We'll guess ""DITTY"".

But note the feedback may be messy with duplicates, but it's permissible.

<guess>ditty</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters absent (x), eliminating **C, R, A, N, E**.
- **Guess 2: spoil** → **S, P, O, L** absent (x), **I** present but wrong position (-). This confirms the word contains **I**, but not in position 4.
- **Guess 3: might** → **M, G, H** absent (x), **I** correct in position 2 (✓), **T** present but wrong position (-). This confirms:
  - Position 2 is **I**.
  - The word contains **T**, but not in position 5.

### Current knowledge:
- **Fixed position**: Position 2 is **I** → Word structure: `[ ? ] I [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ]`.
- **Confirmed present letters**: **I** (position 2), **T** (somewhere not position 5).
- **Eliminated letters**: **A, C, E, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, R, S** (from all feedback).
- **Available letters**: **B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.
- **Constraints**:
  - **T** must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is taken and position 5 is wrong).
  - Must include **T**.

### Strategy:
- Focus on **T** placement: Test **T** in position 3 or 4 (position 1 is less feasible with available letters).
- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., **D, Y, B, W**).
- Consider common word patterns. Words like **BITTY**, **DITTY**, or **WITTY** fit the structure but may have duplicate letters (e.g., double **T**). Feedback will still provide valuable positional insights.
- Choose **DITTY** as the next guess:
  - Structure: **D I T T Y**
    - Position 1: **D** (new letter, tests common consonant).
    - Position 2: **I** (correct, confirmed).
    - Position 3: **T** (tests position 3).
    - Position 4: **T** (duplicate **T**, tests position 4).
    - Position 5: **Y** (new letter, tests common vowel-sound).
  - **DITTY** is a valid English word (meaning a short, simple song).
  - Tests **T** in both position 3 and 4 efficiently, while introducing **D** and **Y**.",Guess 4: ditty -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word that covers common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Okay, so I need to make a new guess based on the feedback from the first guess. The first word I guessed was ""crane"", and all letters got an ""x"", meaning none of them—C, R, A, N, E—are in the secret word. That's actually quite helpful, even though it might seem disappointing. It means I can eliminate those letters entirely from consideration. 

Now, knowing what letters to avoid, I'm thinking about what other common letters could be in the word. The vowels A and E are out, so I should focus on other vowels like I, O, U, and common consonants that weren't used. Letters like S, T, L, and others come to mind. A word that uses different vowels and consonants would be ideal.

I recall that ""ships"" is a word, but it has an S at the end and might be too common. Wait, no—I need to pick something with no repeated letters ideally, since duplicates might complicate feedback. How about ""spoil""? It uses S, P, O, I, L—all unique and include new letters. O and I are vowels, which can help narrow down possibilities. 

Alternatively, ""pious"" comes to mind, but that has S at the end too. Words like ""light"", ""might"", ""fight"" are options, but they share several letters. Since C, R, A, N, E are out, I should avoid words containing those. ""Light"" has L, I, G, H, T—all unused letters, so it has high potential. 

But maybe a word with O and U? Like ""round"", but ""round"" includes R and N, which are excluded. Oops, I have to stick to letters not in the excluded set. So R is out? Yes, from the first feedback. 

Okay, listing possible candidates: ""spoil"", ""plumb"", ""sight"", ""fight"", ""might"". Among these, ""spoil"" introduces S, P, O, I, L—all unguessed letters. It has good coverage and includes vowels and consonants. Seems solid. 

Alternatively, ""sound"" uses S, O, U, N, D—but N is excluded, so that won't work. N was in the first guess and got an x, so it's out. So ""sound"" is invalid. 

""Patch"" uses P, A, T, C, H—A and C are excluded, so that won't work either. 

So I think ""spoil"" is a safe choice—it introduces five completely new letters and covers diverse letters. 

Let's confirm: excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E. 

So ""spoil"": S is new, P is new, O is new, I is new, L is new. Perfect. 

I'll go with ""spoil"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)), we know the secret word contains **none of these letters**: **C, R, A, N, or E**. This means:
- **Vowels**: We must avoid A/E and focus on other vowels (e.g., I, O, U) or vowel-like consonants.
- **Consonants**: We need to prioritize other common English letters like S, T, L, P, M, etc.

For the next guess, I'll choose a word that:
1. Uses **all new letters**, avoiding C/R/A/N/E entirely.
2. Includes **high-frequency letters** (like S, T, L, O, I) to maximize information gain.
3. Balances vowels and consonants to test new possibilities.

A strong candidate is **""SPOIL""** because:
- It introduces **5 new letters**: **S, P, O, I, L**.
- It includes **two vowels (O, I)** and three consonants (S, P, L).
- **S** and **L** are among the most common English consonants, while **O/I** are common vowels.

After submitting **""SPOIL""**, we'll use the feedback to narrow down possibilities further.

<guess>spoil</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: spoil -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) I(-) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses with feedback:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""spoil"" -> S, P, O, L are not in the word, but I is in the word but in the wrong position.

From this, we know:
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, L.
- The letter I is present in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""spoil"" it was at the 4th and got a ""-"", meaning it's elsewhere).

So, the word must contain the letter I, and it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 is wrong).

We also know that the word is 5 letters and must be composed of letters not in the excluded set. The excluded letters are: A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S.

Remaining letters: We have to choose from the rest of the alphabet. Let's list the available letters:
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: I is already known to be in the word, so we must include it. Also, we have to form a valid English word.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes the letter I (but not in the 4th position, because in ""spoil"" it was at position 4 and was wrong position, so it must be in a different position).
- Uses only the available letters (so no A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S).

We also want to test other common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven't tried yet: T, U, D, H, M, etc.

Possible positions for I: Since it can't be in position 4, we can try it in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's think of words that have I and are made of the available letters.

For example:
- Words with I at the start: ""itchy"" -> but we have to check letters. I, T, C, H, Y. But C is excluded (from first guess). So not valid.
- Another: ""input"" -> but P and N are excluded.

We must avoid excluded letters.

Let's try words with I in the second position? For example, ""bight"" (meaning a bend or curve). Letters: B, I, G, H, T. All these are available (B, I, G, H, T not excluded). And I is in position 2.

But note: we don't know if the word has B, G, H, T, but they are available.

Another possibility: ""digit"" -> D, I, G, I, T. But we have two I's? The word ""digit"" has two I's? No, ""digit"" is D-I-G-I-T? Actually, it's D-I-G-I-T, so two I's? But the secret word might have two I's? We don't know. But in our feedback, we only know that at least one I is present. However, we must be cautious.

But let's check: ""digit"" has D, I, G, I, T. The excluded letters don't include D, G, T, and I is allowed. But we have to see if it's valid.

But we are not sure about the frequency. We might want to avoid repeating letters for now to get more information.

Alternatively, ""midst"" -> but S is excluded.

Another idea: ""light"" -> but L is excluded (from ""spoil"" feedback, L is x).

L is excluded.

Let's think of words without the excluded letters.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word that includes I and four other letters from this set.

Some words:
- ""FIGHT"": F, I, G, H, T. All available? F, I, G, H, T are not excluded. And I is in position 2.
- ""THIGH"": T, H, I, G, H. This has two H's? And I in position 3. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We can use it, but it might be less informative if there are duplicates.
- ""WIGHT"": W, I, G, H, T. (a mythical being). I in position 2.
- ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T. I in position 2.
- ""DIGHT"": D, I, G, H, T. (archaic word meaning to adorn). I in position 2.

But note: we don't know if the word has F, W, M, D, etc. But we are trying to test new letters.

We also have to consider that I might be in other positions.

For example, I in position 1: ""itchy"" is invalid because of C. ""inbox"" -> I, N, B, O, X. But N and O are excluded. ""input"" -> P excluded. So hard to find words with I in position 1 without excluded letters.

I in position 3: ""habit"" -> H, A, B, I, T. But A is excluded. ""orbit"" -> O and B? O excluded. ""posit"" -> P and S excluded. So difficult.

I in position 5: ""taxi"" is 4 letters. ""sushi"" -> S excluded. ""tutti"" -> T, U, T, T, I. But T is repeated. And U is available. But we can try.

But perhaps it's easier to try I in position 2.

So let's go with a word that has I in position 2 and uses other common available letters.

Common available letters: T, H, G, D, M, etc.

I think ""MIGHT"" is a good candidate because:
- It uses M, I, G, H, T. All new letters.
- It tests T and H which are common.

Alternatively, ""FIGHT"" is also good.

But we have to choose one. Let's pick ""MIGHT"".

We can also consider ""THUMB"" but that doesn't have I. We must include I.

Another word: ""DIZZY"" -> D, I, Z, Z, Y. But Z is uncommon and repeated. Not ideal.

""JIFFY"" -> J, I, F, F, Y. Repeated F.

So ""MIGHT"" seems solid.

But note: in ""spoil"", I was in position 4 and got a ""-"", meaning I is in the word but not at position 4. In ""MIGHT"", I is at position 2. That's a different position, so it's allowed.

We'll guess ""MIGHT"" and see the feedback.

<guess>might</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these letters are eliminated.
- **Guess 2: spoil** → Letters S, P, O, L are absent (x), and I is present but in the wrong position (-). This means:
  - The secret word **contains I**, but not in position 4 (since it was guessed there and marked wrong).
  - Eliminated letters now include: **A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S**.
  - Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- **Must include I** (since it's confirmed present), but **not in position 4**.
- Use **new, high-frequency letters** from the available set to maximize information (e.g., T, H, G, M, D).
- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize common English words.
- Given I must be repositioned, testing it in **position 2** (a common spot for I in 5-letter words) is a strong choice.

A good candidate is **""MIGHT""**:
- **M, I, G, H, T** → All letters are from the available set, and I is in position 2 (avoiding position 4).
- Tests common letters like T, H, and G, which haven't been tried yet.
- If I is correct in position 2, we'll get a ✓; if not, the feedback will help narrow its position further.

<guess>might</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: spoil -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) I(-) L(x)
Guess 3: might -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have three guesses with feedback:
1. ""crane"" -> All letters incorrect: C, R, A, N, E are absent.
2. ""spoil"" -> S, P, O, L absent; I is present but not in position 4.
3. ""might"" -> M, G, H absent; I is correct in position 2; T is present but not in position 5.

So, summarizing:
- **Definitely in the word**: I (specifically in position 2, since we got a ✓ for it in guess 3).
- **Letters present but position wrong**: T (from guess 3, T is in the word but not in position 5).
- **Eliminated letters**: A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S, M, G, H. (From guess 1 and 2, plus M, G, H from guess 3.)

Eliminated letters: A, C, E, G, H, L, M, N, O P, R, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, I, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: I is fixed in position 2, and T must be included somewhere but not in position 5.

Current knowledge:
- Position 2 is I (from the ✓ in guess 3).
- T is in the word, but not at position 5 (since in ""might"" at position 5 it was marked ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).

The word structure: _ I _ _ _

T can be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is wrong, and position 2 is taken by I).

We need to make a guess that:
- Has I in position 2.
- Includes T (which must be in position 1, 3, or 4).
- Uses only available letters: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word that fits.

Possible words? Let's think of words with structure: [T?] I [letter?] [letter?] [T?] — but T can't be in position 5, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Options:
- T in position 1: T I _ _ _
- T in position 3: _ I T _ _
- T in position 4: _ I _ T _

We also need to use new letters to test possibilities.

Given the available letters, let's consider:
- For T in position 1: ""TI..."" words? Examples: TIGER -> but G and E are eliminated. TIDAL -> D and A, but A eliminated. TIBIA -> B and I again? TIBIA has B and I, but position 4 is A -> eliminated. So hard.

Available: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Therefore, words must be formed from these letters.

Possibilities:
With T in position 1:
- ""TIGER"" not possible (G,E out).
- ""TIDAL"" not (A out).
- ""TIPSY"" -> T,I,P,S,Y. But P and S out. Invalid.
- ""TIZZY"" -> T,I,Z,Z,Y. Letters: T, I, Z, Z, Y. Available? Z and Y are available, but we have two Z's. Word ""tizzy"" means a state of agitation. It uses T, I, Z, Z, Y. So the second Z would duplicate? But we can use it. However, we are trying to test letters, and duplicate might limit information. But acceptable.

But we have eliminated letters: we must avoid P, S, etc.

Another: ""TICKY"" -> C and K? C is out. No.

""TIMED"" -> M,E,D -> M and E out.

""TIMID"" -> M and D; M out.

Available consonants: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So for T I _ _ _, we need valid letters. What about: ""TIKI"" is 4 letters? No. ""TILDE"" -> T,I,L,D,E -> L and E out.

Struggling with T in position 1.

Now T in position 3: _ I T _ _

Possible words: ""BIT TY""? Not. ""CITY"" too short. ""DITTY"" -> D,I,T,T,Y -> letters D,I,T,T,Y. Available? D, T, Y are available. ""Ditty"" is a 5-letter word meaning a short song. Positions: B1=I? Wait, word is D-I-T-T-Y, so position 3 is T, which is good. But we have two T's? The T at position 3 is fixed? No, in the word, position 3 is T and position 4 is T? So two T's.

But we know T is present, and if there are two T's, it's possible.

Similarly, ""BITT Y"" is two words? ""Bitty"" is a word meaning small. But ""bitty"" is B-I-T-T-Y -> positions 1:B, 2:I, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y. So same as above.

Again, duplicates.

""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> same letters.

""PITHY"" -> P is out.

So words like ""ditty"", ""bitty"", ""kitty"", ""witty"" (W,I,T,T,Y) — W is available, so ""witty"" could work.

But we have duplicates of T? Not necessarily a problem, but note that in feedback, we might get multiple marks.

But in guess 3, we have T only once, and it was marked ""-"", meaning at least one T is present. There could be more.

But to avoid duplicates for more information? We don't have to.

Another possibility: T in position 4: _ I _ T _

Words: ""QUI T T"" is ""quits"" would be Q,U,I,T,S but S out. ""QUIET"" -> Q,U,I,E,T -> E out. ""UNI T Y"" -> U,N,I,T,Y -> N out. So difficult.

We need to use the available letters.

Perhaps less common words: ""JIVED"" -> J,I,V,E,D -> E out. ""FIBER"" -> not. 

Since T is involved, and we need to place it elsewhere.

Perhaps ""DIZZY"" -> D,I,Z,Z,Y. But no T. But we need to include T because it is known to be present. So we must include T.

The word must contain T.

So missing T is not an option.

Therefore, consider the possibilities above.

Perhaps T in position 1 with available letters: ""TIKKA"" -> T,I,K,K,A -> A out. ""TWIXT"" -> T,W,I,X,T -> positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:X, 4:T? Or T,W,I,X,T? That's 5 letters? ""Twix T"" is two words? Actually, 'twixt is short for betwixt, but usually written with apostrophe. Not a standard 5-letter word. Probably not valid.

Another idea: ""DUVET"" -> D,U,V,E,T -> E out.

Let's think differently.

For position 1, we can put other available letters: B, D, F, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And include T in position 3 or 4.

For example:
- Word with position structure: _ I T _ _
  - Options: ""BIT TY"" = ""bitty"" -> B,I,T,T,Y -> letters: B, I, T, T, Y. Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y. Feedback: T is in position 3? And also position 4? We know T is present, but we don't know if multiple. However, we are testing.
- ""DITTY"" -> D,I,T,T,Y -> similar.

But ""ditty"" is D-I-T-T-Y. So T is in positions 3 and 4? That might be okay.

- ""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> K in position 1, T in 3 and 4.
- ""WITTY"" -> W,I,T,T,Y -> same.

Which one to choose? We need to test new letters.

""WITTY"" uses W (which we haven't tested) and Y.

Alternatively, to test different sets, let's pick ""BITTY"" because B is a common letter? But ""bitty"" might be less common, but it's accepted in Wordle.

Or ""DITTY""? D is common.

But we also have position 5 to consider.

Another word without duplicate: Is there a word with only one T?
For T in position 3: Structure _ I T _ _ 
Possible words with no duplicate letters.

""JITNEY"" too long? No, 5 letters? J-I-T-N-E-Y? 6 letters. Short words: ""CITY"" not 5. ""PITHY"" out due to P/H? H is eliminated? From guess 3, H is marked x in ""might"", so H is out.

H is eliminated.

Available letters: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Searching: ""BIGHT"" -> B,I,G,H,T -> G and H are both eliminated? From guess 3, G and H are x. So out.

""FIGHT"" -> F,I,G,H,T -> G and H out.

""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> duplicate T.

Similarly, ""DITTO"" -> O out.

""MITTS"" -> M and S out.

So it seems hard to find words without duplicates or without eliminated letters for the structure.

T in position 4: _ I _ T _
Possible words: ""QUI T E"" -> E out. ""QUI T S"" -> S out. ""DAILY"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> A and L out. ""DIET T"" -> D,I,E,T,T -> E out. ""PIETY"" -> P and E out.

""MINTY"" -> M and N out.

So the only feasible words seem to be with T in position 3 and another letter, but using duplicates? Or T in position 1 with less common combinations.

Try ""TIPSY"" -> but P and S out.

Perhaps ""TWIXT"" isn't valid. Let's find accepted words.

Another possibility: ""OUIJA"" -> O out. ""ADIEU"" -> A,E out.

What about ""BUY T"" not, ""JUST T"" not.

Let's consider that T might be in position 1 after all: ""TOUZY"" - not common. ""TAWNY"" - A and W? ""A"" eliminated. ""TUNNY"" - U,N,N,Y -> N out.

Not good.

Perhaps we missed a word: ""TWI T Y"" - 6 letters.

Or ""TAFFY"" -> T,A,F,F,Y -> A out.

Another idea: ""TU Y"" no.

We need to include U or other vowels.

Available vowels: Only left? U might be, Y is sometimes vowel.

""QUILL"" -> Q,U,I,L,L -> L out.

""BUILD"" -> B,U,I,L,D -> L out.

T is required.

Perhaps ""DUTY I"" no.

Let's list possible words:

With I fixed at position 2 and T included, and no eliminated letters:

- ""BITTY"" (B,I,T,T,Y) - valid
- ""DITTY"" (D,I,T,T,Y) - valid
- ""KITTY"" (K,I,T,T,Y) - valid
- ""WITTY"" (W,I,T,T,Y) - valid
- ""TITTY"" - not meaning, or offensive.

Also ""PIT T Y"" but P out.

So among B,D,K,W, which letters to test?

Since D and B are more common, we might choose ""DITTY"" or ""BITTY"".

""WITTY"" uses W, which is less common.

But we are trying to get information. ""DITTY"" uses D and Y, both new.

Similarly, ""KITTY"" uses K and Y.

To maximize new letters, let's pick ""DITTY"" because D is more flexible than K or W.

But we have duplicate T, so we know T is present, but feedback might not tell us how many if both T's are incorrect position or something.

In ""DITTY"", the T at position 3 and 4. But we know T is at least present, but in the secret word, it might be at position 1 or elsewhere? But in our structure, position 2 is I, so secret word is _ I _ _ _, so T could be at 1,3,4.

In ""DITTY"", if we have T at 3 and 4, but if the secret word has T at position 1, for example, then the T we see might only be placed at position 1, and we get feedback accordingly.

Similarly, if secret word has T at position 3, our T at 3 might be ✓, etc.

So we can try it.

Perhaps ""TAWPY"" -> not a word? ""JAW T Y"" no.

""JUICED"" -> J,U,I,C,E -> C and E out.

Not found other words.

Therefore, we go with ""DITTY"".

But ""ditty"" has two T's, but we are testing.

To be safe, we can use ""WITTY"" to test W, but B is perhaps more common.

But D is letter.

So let's choose ""BITTY"" or ""DITTY"". I'll pick ""dITTY"" with first letter D.

No, ""DITTY"" starts with D.

Or to include more unique letters, ""QUIP T"" not.

Another word: ""FU T Z Y""? But Z and Y? ""FUTZY"" is not common? ""Futzy"" might be slang. Probably not accepted.

""TA V V Y"" no.

So stick with the realistic ones.

We'll guess ""DITTY"".

But note the feedback may be messy with duplicates, but it's permissible.

<guess>ditty</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters absent (x), eliminating **C, R, A, N, E**.
- **Guess 2: spoil** → **S, P, O, L** absent (x), **I** present but wrong position (-). This confirms the word contains **I**, but not in position 4.
- **Guess 3: might** → **M, G, H** absent (x), **I** correct in position 2 (✓), **T** present but wrong position (-). This confirms:
  - Position 2 is **I**.
  - The word contains **T**, but not in position 5.

### Current knowledge:
- **Fixed position**: Position 2 is **I** → Word structure: `[ ? ] I [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ]`.
- **Confirmed present letters**: **I** (position 2), **T** (somewhere not position 5).
- **Eliminated letters**: **A, C, E, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, R, S** (from all feedback).
- **Available letters**: **B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.
- **Constraints**:
  - **T** must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is taken and position 5 is wrong).
  - Must include **T**.

### Strategy:
- Focus on **T** placement: Test **T** in position 3 or 4 (position 1 is less feasible with available letters).
- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., **D, Y, B, W**).
- Consider common word patterns. Words like **BITTY**, **DITTY**, or **WITTY** fit the structure but may have duplicate letters (e.g., double **T**). Feedback will still provide valuable positional insights.
- Choose **DITTY** as the next guess:
  - Structure: **D I T T Y**
    - Position 1: **D** (new letter, tests common consonant).
    - Position 2: **I** (correct, confirmed).
    - Position 3: **T** (tests position 3).
    - Position 4: **T** (duplicate **T**, tests position 4).
    - Position 5: **Y** (new letter, tests common vowel-sound).
  - **DITTY** is a valid English word (meaning a short, simple song).
  - Tests **T** in both position 3 and 4 efficiently, while introducing **D** and **Y**.

The first word I guessed was ""crane"", and all letters got an ""x"", meaning none of them—C, R, A, N, E—are in the secret word. That\'s actually quite helpful, even though it might seem disappointing. It means I can eliminate those letters entirely from consideration. \n\nNow, knowing what letters to avoid, I\'m thinking about what other common letters could be in the word. The vowels A and E are out, so I should focus on other vowels like I, O, U, and common consonants that weren\'t used. Letters like S, T, L, and others come to mind. A word that uses different vowels and consonants would be ideal.\n\nI recall that ""ships"" is a word, but it has an S at the end and might be too common. Wait, no—I need to pick something with no repeated letters ideally, since duplicates might complicate feedback. How about ""spoil""? It uses S, P, O, I, L—all unique and include new letters. O and I are vowels, which can help narrow down possibilities. \n\nAlternatively, ""pious"" comes to mind, but that has S at the end too. Words like ""light"", ""might"", ""fight"" are options, but they share several letters. Since C, R, A, N, E are out, I should avoid words containing those. ""Light"" has L, I, G, H, T—all unused letters, so it has high potential. \n\nBut maybe a word with O and U? Like ""round"", but ""round"" includes R and N, which are excluded. Oops, I have to stick to letters not in the excluded set. So R is out? Yes, from the first feedback. \n\nOkay, listing possible candidates: ""spoil"", ""plumb"", ""sight"", ""fight"", ""might"". Among these, ""spoil"" introduces S, P, O, I, L—all unguessed letters. It has good coverage and includes vowels and consonants. Seems solid. \n\nAlternatively, ""sound"" uses S, O, U, N, D—but N is excluded, so that won\'t work. N was in the first guess and got an x, so it\'s out. So ""sound"" is invalid. \n\n""Patch"" uses P, A, T, C, H—A and C are excluded, so that won\'t work either. \n\nSo I think ""spoil"" is a safe choice—it introduces five completely new letters and covers diverse letters. \n\nLet\'s confirm: excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E. \n\nSo ""spoil"": S is new, P is new, O is new, I is new, L is new. Perfect. \n\nI\'ll go with ""spoil"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)), we know the secret word contains **none of these letters**: **C, R, A, N, or E**. This means:\n- **Vowels**: We must avoid A/E and focus on other vowels (e.g., I, O, U) or vowel-like consonants.\n- **Consonants**: We need to prioritize other common English letters like S, T, L, P, M, etc.\n\nFor the next guess, I\'ll choose a word that:\n1. Uses **all new letters**, avoiding C/R/A/N/E entirely.\n2. Includes **high-frequency letters** (like S, T, L, O, I) to maximize information gain.\n3. Balances vowels and consonants to test new possibilities.\n\nA strong candidate is **""SPOIL""** because:\n- It introduces **5 new letters**: **S, P, O, I, L**.\n- It includes **two vowels (O, I)** and three consonants (S, P, L).\n- **S** and **L** are among the most common English consonants, while **O/I** are common vowels.\n\nAfter submitting **""SPOIL""**, we\'ll use the feedback to narrow down possibilities further.\n\n<guess>spoil</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spoil -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) I(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses with feedback:\n1.

Common letters we haven\'t tried yet: T, U, D, H, M, etc.\n\nPossible positions for I: Since it can\'t be in position 4, we can try it in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have I and are made of the available letters.\n\nFor example:\n- Words with I at the start: ""itchy"" -> but we have to check letters. I, T, C, H, Y. But C is excluded (from first guess). So not valid.\n- Another: ""input"" -> but P and N are excluded.\n\nWe must avoid excluded letters.\n\nLet\'s try words with I in the second position? For example, ""bight"" (meaning a bend or curve). Letters: B, I, G, H, T. All these are available (B, I, G, H, T not excluded). And I is in position 2.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has B, G, H, T, but they are available.\n\nAnother possibility: ""digit"" -> D, I, G, I, T. But we have two I\'s? The word ""digit"" has two I\'s? No, ""digit"" is D-I-G-I-T? Actually, it\'s D-I-G-I-T, so two I\'s? But the secret word might have two I\'s? We don\'t know. But in our feedback, we only know that at least one I is present. However, we must be cautious.\n\nBut let\'s check: ""digit"" has D, I, G, I, T. The excluded letters don\'t include D, G, T, and I is allowed. But we have to see if it\'s valid.\n\nBut we are not sure about the frequency. We might want to avoid repeating letters for now to get more information.\n\nAlternatively, ""midst"" -> but S is excluded.\n\nAnother idea: ""light"" -> but L is excluded (from ""spoil"" feedback, L is x).\n\nL is excluded.\n\nLet\'s think of words without the excluded letters.\n\nAvailable: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need a word that includes I and four other letters from this set.\n\nSome words:\n- ""FIGHT"": F, I, G, H, T. All available? F, I, G, H, T are not excluded. And I is in position 2.\n- ""THIGH"": T, H, I, G, H. This has two H\'s? And I in position 3. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. We can use it, but it might be less informative if there are duplicates.\n- ""WIGHT"": W, I, G, H, T. (a mythical being). I in position 2.\n- ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T. I in position 2.\n- ""DIGHT"": D, I, G, H, T. (archaic word meaning to adorn). I in position 2.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has F, W, M, D, etc. But we are trying to test new letters.\n\nWe also have to consider that I might be in other positions.\n\nFor example, I in position 1: ""itchy"" is invalid because of C. ""inbox"" -> I, N, B, O, X. But N and O are excluded. ""input"" -> P excluded. So hard to find words with I in position 1 without excluded letters.\n\nI in position 3: ""habit"" -> H, A, B, I, T. But A is excluded. ""orbit"" -> O and B? O excluded. ""posit"" -> P and S excluded. So difficult.\n\nI in position 5: ""taxi"" is 4 letters. ""sushi"" -> S excluded. ""tutti"" -> T, U, T, T, I. But T is repeated. And U is available. But we can try.\n\nBut perhaps it\'s easier to try I in position 2.\n\nSo let\'s go with a word that has I in position 2 and uses other common available letters.\n\nCommon available letters: T, H, G, D, M, etc.\n\nI think ""MIGHT"" is a good candidate because:\n- It uses M, I, G, H, T. All new letters.\n- It tests T and H which are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""FIGHT"" is also good.\n\nBut we have to choose one. Let\'s pick ""MIGHT"".\n\nWe can also consider ""THUMB"" but that doesn\'t have I. We must include I.\n\nAnother word: ""DIZZY"" -> D, I, Z, Z, Y. But Z is uncommon and repeated. Not ideal.\n\n""JIFFY"" -> J, I, F, F, Y. Repeated F.\n\nSo ""MIGHT"" seems solid.\n\nBut note: in ""spoil"", I was in position 4 and got a ""-"", meaning I is in the word but not at position 4. In ""MIGHT"", I is at position 2. That\'s a different position, so it\'s allowed.\n\nWe\'ll guess ""MIGHT"" and see the feedback.\n\n<guess>might</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these letters are eliminated.\n- **Guess 2: spoil** → Letters S, P, O, L are absent (x), and I is present but in the wrong position (-).

No.\n\n""TIMED"" -> M,E,D -> M and E out.\n\n""TIMID"" -> M and D; M out.\n\nAvailable consonants: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nSo for T I _ _ _, we need valid letters. What about: ""TIKI"" is 4 letters? No. ""TILDE"" -> T,I,L,D,E -> L and E out.\n\nStruggling with T in position 1.\n\nNow T in position 3: _ I T _ _\n\nPossible words: ""BIT TY""? Not. ""CITY"" too short. ""DITTY"" -> D,I,T,T,Y -> letters D,I,T,T,Y. Available? D, T, Y are available. ""Ditty"" is a 5-letter word meaning a short song. Positions: B1=I? Wait, word is D-I-T-T-Y, so position 3 is T, which is good. But we have two T\'s? The T at position 3 is fixed? No, in the word, position 3 is T and position 4 is T? So two T\'s.\n\nBut we know T is present, and if there are two T\'s, it\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""BITT Y"" is two words? ""Bitty"" is a word meaning small. But ""bitty"" is B-I-T-T-Y -> positions 1:B, 2:I, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y. So same as above.\n\nAgain, duplicates.\n\n""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> same letters.\n\n""PITHY"" -> P is out.\n\nSo words like ""ditty"", ""bitty"", ""kitty"", ""witty"" (W,I,T,T,Y) — W is available, so ""witty"" could work.\n\nBut we have duplicates of T? Not necessarily a problem, but note that in feedback, we might get multiple marks.\n\nBut in guess 3, we have T only once, and it was marked ""-"", meaning at least one T is present. There could be more.\n\nBut to avoid duplicates for more information? We don\'t have to.\n\nAnother possibility: T in position 4: _ I _ T _\n\nWords: ""QUI T T"" is ""quits"" would be Q,U,I,T,S but S out. ""QUIET"" -> Q,U,I,E,T -> E out. ""UNI T Y"" -> U,N,I,T,Y -> N out. So difficult.\n\nWe need to use the available letters.\n\nPerhaps less common words: ""JIVED"" -> J,I,V,E,D -> E out. ""FIBER"" -> not. \n\nSince T is involved, and we need to place it elsewhere.\n\nPerhaps ""DIZZY"" -> D,I,Z,Z,Y. But no T. But we need to include T because it is known to be present. So we must include T.\n\nThe word must contain T.\n\nSo missing T is not an option.\n\nTherefore, consider the possibilities above.\n\nPerhaps T in position 1 with available letters: ""TIKKA"" -> T,I,K,K,A -> A out. ""TWIXT"" -> T,W,I,X,T -> positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:X, 4:T? Or T,W,I,X,T? That\'s 5 letters? ""Twix T"" is two words? Actually, \'twixt is short for betwixt, but usually written with apostrophe. Not a standard 5-letter word. Probably not valid.\n\nAnother idea: ""DUVET"" -> D,U,V,E,T -> E out.\n\nLet\'s think differently.\n\nFor position 1, we can put other available letters: B, D, F, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nAnd include T in position 3 or 4.\n\nFor example:\n- Word with position structure: _ I T _ _\n  - Options: ""BIT TY"" = ""bitty"" -> B,I,T,T,Y -> letters: B, I, T, T, Y. Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y. Feedback: T is in position 3? And also position 4? We know T is present, but we don\'t know if multiple. However, we are testing.\n- ""DITTY"" -> D,I,T,T,Y -> similar.\n\nBut ""ditty"" is D-I-T-T-Y. So T is in positions 3 and 4? That might be okay.\n\n- ""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> K in position 1, T in 3 and 4.\n- ""WITTY"" -> W,I,T,T,Y -> same.\n\nWhich one to choose? We need to test new letters.\n\n""WITTY"" uses W (which we haven\'t tested) and Y.\n\nAlternatively, to test different sets, let\'s pick ""BITTY"" because B is a common letter? But ""bitty"" might be less common, but it\'s accepted in Wordle.\n\nOr ""DITTY""? D is common.\n\nBut we also have position 5 to consider.\n\nAnother word without duplicate: Is there a word with only one T?\nFor T in position 3: Structure _ I T _ _ \nPossible words with no duplicate letters.\n\n""JITNEY"" too long? No, 5 letters? J-I-T-N-E-Y? 6 letters. Short words: ""CITY"" not 5. ""PITHY"" out due to P/H? H is eliminated? From guess 3, H is marked x in ""might"", so H is out.\n\nH is eliminated.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nSearching: ""BIGHT"" -> B,I,G,H,T -> G and H are both eliminated? From guess 3, G and H are x. So out.\n\n""FIGHT"" -> F,I,G,H,T -> G and H out.\n\n""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> duplicate T.\n\nSimilarly, ""DITTO"" -> O out.\n\n""MITTS"" -> M and S out.\n\nSo it seems hard to find words without duplicates or without eliminated letters for the structure.\n\nT in position 4: _ I _ T _\nPossible words: ""QUI T E"" -> E out. ""QUI T S"" -> S out. ""DAILY"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> A and L out. ""DIET T"" -> D,I,E,T,T -> E out. ""PIETY"" -> P and E out.\n\n""MINTY"" -> M and N out.\n\nSo the only feasible words seem to be with T in position 3 and another letter, but using duplicates? Or T in position 1 with less common combinations.\n\nTry ""TIPSY"" -> but P and S out.\n\nPerhaps ""TWIXT"" isn\'t valid. Let\'s find accepted words.\n\nAnother possibility: ""OUIJA"" -> O out. ""ADIEU"" -> A,E out.\n\nWhat about ""BUY T"" not, ""JUST T"" not.\n\nLet\'s consider that T might be in position 1 after all: ""TOUZY"" - not common. ""TAWNY"" - A and W? ""A"" eliminated. ""TUNNY"" - U,N,N,Y -> N out.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps we missed a word: ""TWI T Y"" - 6 letters.\n\nOr ""TAFFY"" -> T,A,F,F,Y -> A out.\n\nAnother idea: ""TU Y"" no.\n\nWe need to include U or other vowels.\n\nAvailable vowels: Only left? U might be, Y is sometimes vowel.\n\n""QUILL"" -> Q,U,I,L,L -> L out.\n\n""BUILD"" -> B,U,I,L,D -> L out.\n\nT is required.\n\nPerhaps ""DUTY I"" no.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\nWith I fixed at position 2 and T included, and no eliminated letters:\n\n- ""BITTY"" (B,I,T,T,Y) - valid\n- ""DITTY"" (D,I,T,T,Y) - valid\n- ""KITTY"" (K,I,T,T,Y) - valid\n- ""WITTY"" (W,I,T,T,Y) - valid\n- ""TITTY"" - not meaning, or offensive.\n\nAlso ""PIT T Y"" but P out.\n\nSo among B,D,K,W, which letters to test?\n\nSince D and B are more common, we might choose ""DITTY"" or ""BITTY"".\n\n""WITTY"" uses W, which is less common.\n\nBut we are trying to get information. ""DITTY"" uses D and Y, both new.\n\nSimilarly, ""KITTY"" uses K and Y.\n\nTo maximize new letters, let\'s pick ""DITTY"" because D is more flexible than K or W.\n\nBut we have duplicate T, so we know T is present, but feedback might not tell us how many if both T\'s are incorrect position or something.\n\nIn ""DITTY"", the T at position 3 and 4. But we know T is at least present, but in the secret word, it might be at position 1 or elsewhere? But in our structure, position 2 is I, so secret word is _ I _ _ _, so T could be at 1,3,4.\n\nIn ""DITTY"", if we have T at 3 and 4, but if the secret word has T at position 1, for example, then the T we see might only be placed at position 1, and we get feedback accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, if secret word has T at position 3, our T at 3 might be ✓, etc.\n\nSo we can try it.\n\nPerhaps ""TAWPY"" -> not a word? ""JAW T Y"" no.\n\n""JUICED"" -> J,U,I,C,E -> C and E out.\n\nNot found other words.\n\nTherefore, we go with ""DITTY"".\n\nBut ""ditty"" has two T\'s, but we are testing.\n\nTo be safe, we can use ""WITTY"" to test W, but B is perhaps more common.\n\nBut D is letter.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""BITTY"" or ""DITTY"". I\'ll pick ""dITTY"" with first letter D.\n\nNo, ""DITTY"" starts with D.\n\nOr to include more unique letters, ""QUIP T"" not.\n\nAnother word: ""FU T Z Y""? But Z and Y? ""FUTZY"" is not common? ""Futzy"" might be slang. Probably not accepted.\n\n""TA V V Y"" no.\n\nSo stick with the realistic ones.\n\nWe\'ll guess ""DITTY"".\n\nBut note the feedback may be messy with duplicates, but it\'s permissible.\n\n<guess>ditty</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters absent (x), eliminating **C, R, A, N, E**.\n- **Guess 2: spoil** → **S, P, O, L** absent (x), **I** present but wrong position (-). This confirms the word contains **I**, but not in position 4.\n- **Guess 3: might** → **M, G, H** absent (x), **I** correct in position 2 (✓), **T** present but wrong position (-). This confirms:\n  - Position 2 is **I**.\n  - The word contains **T**, but not in position 5.\n\n### Current knowledge:\n- **Fixed position**: Position 2 is **I** → Word structure: `[ ? ] I [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ]`.\n- **Confirmed present letters**: **I** (position 2), **T** (somewhere not position 5).\n- **Eliminated letters**: **A, C, E, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, R, S** (from all feedback).\n- **Available letters**: **B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.\n- **Constraints**:\n  - **T** must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is taken and position 5 is wrong).\n  - Must include **T**.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Focus on **T** placement: Test **T** in position 3 or 4 (position 1 is less feasible with available letters).\n- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., **D, Y, B, W**).\n- Consider common word patterns. Words like **BITTY**, **DITTY**, or **WITTY** fit the structure but may have duplicate letters (e.g., double **T**). Feedback will still provide valuable positional insights.\n- Choose **DITTY** as the next guess:\n  - Structure: **D I T T Y**\n    - Position 1: **D** (new letter, tests common consonant).\n    - Position 2: **I** (correct, confirmed).\n    - Position 3: **T** (tests position 3).\n    - Position 4: **T** (duplicate **T**, tests position 4).\n    - Position 5: **Y** (new letter, tests common vowel-sound).\n  - **DITTY** is a valid English word (meaning a short, simple song).\n  - Tests **T** in both position 3 and 4 efficiently, while introducing **D** and **Y**.\n\n<guess>ditty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spoil -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) I(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: might -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)\nGuess 4: ditty -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the feedback for the fourth guess: ""ditty"" -> D(x) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)
This means:
- D is not in the word (x)
- I is in the correct position (we already knew this was position 2)
- T is in the correct position (position 3)
- T is in the correct position (position 4) - note that ""ditty"" has two T's: one at position 3 and one at position 4. Both are marked correct, so T is at position 3 and position 4 in the secret word.
- Y is in the correct position (position 5)

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown (but not D, and not any eliminated letter)
- Position 2: I (known)
- Position 3: T (known)
- Position 4: T (known)
- Position 5: Y (known)

So the word is of the form: _ I T T Y

Now we know the entire word except the first letter. The secret word is ?ITTY.

We also have the eliminated letters from previous guesses: 
From guess 1: C, R, A, N, E 
From guess 2: S, P, O, L 
From guess 3: M, G, H 
From guess 4: D 

Additionally, we had eliminated: A,C,E,G,H,L,M,N,O,P,R,S and now D.

Available letters are: B, F, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and note we haven't used B but it is available).

But we must form a word that ends with ITTY. Common words are:
- BITTY (but B is available, and we haven't eliminated B)
- KITTY 
- WITTY 
- PITTY (but P is eliminated) 
- etc.

In our current feedback for guess 4, we used ""ditty"" and D was incorrect. So the first letter is not D. Also, we know the word must be a 5-letter English word.

Possible candidates:
- BITTY: meaning small or fragmented.
- KITTY: meaning a fund of money or a young cat.
- WITTY: meaning clever and funny.
- MITTY: not common (and M is eliminated)
- FITTY: not common (slang? but perhaps not)
- JITTY: not common (variant of jetty? but 5 letters? j-i-t-t-y? not really)
- QITTY: not a word
- VITTY: not a word
- ZITTY: not common, but might be used for acne? Not standard.

Valid English words ending in ITTY: 
- BITTY: accepted in word games
- KITTY: accepted
- WITTY: accepted
- TITTY: not appropriate and often excluded from word lists.

Given that D is eliminated and we have W and K available, we need to choose between BITTY, KITTY, WITTY.

But note: we are allowed only one more guess? We have used 4 guesses, so we have 2 left? But the prompt says ""new guess"", so we can try one.

However, we need to make a guess that is a valid word. We can guess any one of these, and the goal is to solve it.

But let's see what letters we haven't tested: We have used many letters and eliminated others. We don't have any other constraints.

So we can guess:
- BITTY
- KITTY
- WITTY

Any of these could be the secret word? But we don't know.

We must choose one to guess.

To decide, note that we haven't used B, K, W. We might try one that tests a new letter.

But since we know the word is ?ITTY, and we have three candidates, we have to pick one.

Perhaps we can use the fact that in guess 2, we had I at position 4 but it was wrong. Now, the word has I at position 2 (fixed), T at 3 and 4 (both fixed), and Y at 5 (fixed). So the first letter must be one that forms a valid word.

Given that, we can guess KITTY? Or BITTY? They are all valid.

But let's note: in guess 3, we had T at position 5, which was marked wrong position. But now we have T at position 3 and 4. Why was T marked wrong at position 5? Because it is not at position 5? But now we have two T's? Actually, the secret word has two T's: at positions 3 and 4. Therefore, if we had guessed T at position 5, it would be marked as not present in that position, which is consistent. So no issue.

Now, we have three options: B, K, W. We don't have any more feedback to distinguish.

Thus, we must pick one. We can choose BITTY because B is a common consonant? Or arbitrarily.

Perhaps the secret word does not have duplicate letters? But in this case, KITTY and BITTY also have duplicate T's? Actually, all candidates have I, T, T, Y and then the first letter. So all have duplicate T's.

Therefore, we choose BITTY? Or we can choose the most common.

Word frequency: ""kitten"" might be more common, but ""kitty"" is acceptable. ""Bitty"" is less common. ""Witty"" is adjective.

Since we have no clues, we pick one.

But note: we must avoid eliminated letters. We haven't eliminated B, K, or W.

We'll guess ""KITTY"" because it is a standard word.

But let's make sure: ""k"" is available? Yes.

Alternatively, to save a guess? We have two guesses left, but we can hit it.

Another thing: in guess 4 we guessed ""ditty"", which had T at position 3 and 4, and got T(✓) for both, meaning those positions are T. So the secret word has T at 3 and 4. Then Y at 5, I at 2. So only position 1 is missing.

Therefore, we can guess any word of the form ?ITTY, and we have options: B (for BITTY), K (for KITTY), W (for WITTY).

We don't know which. We have to pick one.

Perhaps to get feedback? We are forced to guess one of them.

But if we guess KITTY, and if it's correct, we win. Otherwise, we'll know it's one of the others.

Similarly.

Let's guess ""kitty"".

We'll guess KITTY.
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- **Position 2 is fixed as I** (confirmed in guess 3: ""might"" → I(✓)).
- **Position 3 is fixed as T** (confirmed in guess 4: ""ditty"" → T(✓) at position 3).
- **Position 4 is fixed as T** (confirmed in guess 4: ""ditty"" → T(✓) at position 4).
- **Position 5 is fixed as Y** (confirmed in guess 4: ""ditty"" → Y(✓)).
- **Position 1 is the only unknown**, and it cannot be any of the eliminated letters: **A, C, D, E, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, R, S** (from cumulative feedback). Available letters for position 1 include **B, F, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z**.

The secret word must therefore be of the form `[?] I T T Y`, where `?` is a letter from the available set. Common English words matching this pattern are:
- **BITTY** (meaning fragmentary or small)
- **KITTY** (meaning a fund or a young cat)
- **WITTY** (meaning clever and humorous)

Given that:
- We have two remaining guesses to solve the puzzle.
- Prioritizing **high-frequency starting consonants** (like B or K) helps test more common candidates first.
- **BITTY** introduces **B**, a common letter not yet tested, providing critical information even if incorrect.

Thus, **BITTY** is the optimal next guess to maximize the chance of solving or narrowing the possibilities.

- T is in the correct position (position 3)
- T is in the correct position (position 4) - note that ""ditty"" has two T's: one at position 3 and one at position 4. Both are marked correct, so T is at position 3 and position 4 in the secret word.
- Y is in the correct position (position 5)

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown (but not D, and not any eliminated letter)
- Position 2: I (known)
- Position 3: T (known)

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Okay, so I need to make a new guess based on the feedback from the first guess. The first word I guessed was ""crane"", and all letters got an ""x"", meaning none of them—C, R, A, N, E—are in the secret word. That's actually quite helpful, even though it might seem disappointing. It means I can eliminate those letters entirely from consideration. 

Now, knowing what letters to avoid, I'm thinking about what other common letters could be in the word. The vowels A and E are out, so I should focus on other vowels like I, O, U, and common consonants that weren't used. Letters like S, T, L, and others come to mind. A word that uses different vowels and consonants would be ideal.

I recall that ""ships"" is a word, but it has an S at the end and might be too common. Wait, no—I need to pick something with no repeated letters ideally, since duplicates might complicate feedback. How about ""spoil""? It uses S, P, O, I, L—all unique and include new letters. O and I are vowels, which can help narrow down possibilities. 

Alternatively, ""pious"" comes to mind, but that has S at the end too. Words like ""light"", ""might"", ""fight"" are options, but they share several letters. Since C, R, A, N, E are out, I should avoid words containing those. ""Light"" has L, I, G, H, T—all unused letters, so it has high potential. 

But maybe a word with O and U? Like ""round"", but ""round"" includes R and N, which are excluded. Oops, I have to stick to letters not in the excluded set. So R is out? Yes, from the first feedback. 

Okay, listing possible candidates: ""spoil"", ""plumb"", ""sight"", ""fight"", ""might"". Among these, ""spoil"" introduces S, P, O, I, L—all unguessed letters. It has good coverage and includes vowels and consonants. Seems solid. 

Alternatively, ""sound"" uses S, O, U, N, D—but N is excluded, so that won't work. N was in the first guess and got an x, so it's out. So ""sound"" is invalid. 

""Patch"" uses P, A, T, C, H—A and C are excluded, so that won't work either. 

So I think ""spoil"" is a safe choice—it introduces five completely new letters and covers diverse letters. 

Let's confirm: excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E. 

So ""spoil"": S is new, P is new, O is new, I is new, L is new. Perfect. 

I'll go with ""spoil"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)), we know the secret word contains **none of these letters**: **C, R, A, N, or E**. This means:
- **Vowels**: We must avoid A/E and focus on other vowels (e.g., I, O, U) or vowel-like consonants.
- **Consonants**: We need to prioritize other common English letters like S, T, L, P, M, etc.

For the next guess, I'll choose a word that:
1. Uses **all new letters**, avoiding C/R/A/N/E entirely.
2. Includes **high-frequency letters** (like S, T, L, O, I) to maximize information gain.
3. Balances vowels and consonants to test new possibilities.

A strong candidate is **""SPOIL""** because:
- It introduces **5 new letters**: **S, P, O, I, L**.
- It includes **two vowels (O, I)** and three consonants (S, P, L).
- **S** and **L** are among the most common English consonants, while **O/I** are common vowels.

After submitting **""SPOIL""**, we'll use the feedback to narrow down possibilities further.

<guess>spoil</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: spoil -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) I(-) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses with feedback:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters wrong: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""spoil"" -> S, P, O, L are not in the word, but I is in the word but in the wrong position.

From this, we know:
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, O, L.
- The letter I is present in the word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""spoil"" it was at the 4th and got a ""-"", meaning it's elsewhere).

So, the word must contain the letter I, and it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since position 4 is wrong).

We also know that the word is 5 letters and must be composed of letters not in the excluded set. The excluded letters are: A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S.

Remaining letters: We have to choose from the rest of the alphabet. Let's list the available letters:
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: I is already known to be in the word, so we must include it. Also, we have to form a valid English word.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes the letter I (but not in the 4th position, because in ""spoil"" it was at position 4 and was wrong position, so it must be in a different position).
- Uses only the available letters (so no A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S).

We also want to test other common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven't tried yet: T, U, D, H, M, etc.

Possible positions for I: Since it can't be in position 4, we can try it in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's think of words that have I and are made of the available letters.

For example:
- Words with I at the start: ""itchy"" -> but we have to check letters. I, T, C, H, Y. But C is excluded (from first guess). So not valid.
- Another: ""input"" -> but P and N are excluded.

We must avoid excluded letters.

Let's try words with I in the second position? For example, ""bight"" (meaning a bend or curve). Letters: B, I, G, H, T. All these are available (B, I, G, H, T not excluded). And I is in position 2.

But note: we don't know if the word has B, G, H, T, but they are available.

Another possibility: ""digit"" -> D, I, G, I, T. But we have two I's? The word ""digit"" has two I's? No, ""digit"" is D-I-G-I-T? Actually, it's D-I-G-I-T, so two I's? But the secret word might have two I's? We don't know. But in our feedback, we only know that at least one I is present. However, we must be cautious.

But let's check: ""digit"" has D, I, G, I, T. The excluded letters don't include D, G, T, and I is allowed. But we have to see if it's valid.

But we are not sure about the frequency. We might want to avoid repeating letters for now to get more information.

Alternatively, ""midst"" -> but S is excluded.

Another idea: ""light"" -> but L is excluded (from ""spoil"" feedback, L is x).

L is excluded.

Let's think of words without the excluded letters.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word that includes I and four other letters from this set.

Some words:
- ""FIGHT"": F, I, G, H, T. All available? F, I, G, H, T are not excluded. And I is in position 2.
- ""THIGH"": T, H, I, G, H. This has two H's? And I in position 3. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We can use it, but it might be less informative if there are duplicates.
- ""WIGHT"": W, I, G, H, T. (a mythical being). I in position 2.
- ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T. I in position 2.
- ""DIGHT"": D, I, G, H, T. (archaic word meaning to adorn). I in position 2.

But note: we don't know if the word has F, W, M, D, etc. But we are trying to test new letters.

We also have to consider that I might be in other positions.

For example, I in position 1: ""itchy"" is invalid because of C. ""inbox"" -> I, N, B, O, X. But N and O are excluded. ""input"" -> P excluded. So hard to find words with I in position 1 without excluded letters.

I in position 3: ""habit"" -> H, A, B, I, T. But A is excluded. ""orbit"" -> O and B? O excluded. ""posit"" -> P and S excluded. So difficult.

I in position 5: ""taxi"" is 4 letters. ""sushi"" -> S excluded. ""tutti"" -> T, U, T, T, I. But T is repeated. And U is available. But we can try.

But perhaps it's easier to try I in position 2.

So let's go with a word that has I in position 2 and uses other common available letters.

Common available letters: T, H, G, D, M, etc.

I think ""MIGHT"" is a good candidate because:
- It uses M, I, G, H, T. All new letters.
- It tests T and H which are common.

Alternatively, ""FIGHT"" is also good.

But we have to choose one. Let's pick ""MIGHT"".

We can also consider ""THUMB"" but that doesn't have I. We must include I.

Another word: ""DIZZY"" -> D, I, Z, Z, Y. But Z is uncommon and repeated. Not ideal.

""JIFFY"" -> J, I, F, F, Y. Repeated F.

So ""MIGHT"" seems solid.

But note: in ""spoil"", I was in position 4 and got a ""-"", meaning I is in the word but not at position 4. In ""MIGHT"", I is at position 2. That's a different position, so it's allowed.

We'll guess ""MIGHT"" and see the feedback.

<guess>might</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these letters are eliminated.
- **Guess 2: spoil** → Letters S, P, O, L are absent (x), and I is present but in the wrong position (-). This means:
  - The secret word **contains I**, but not in position 4 (since it was guessed there and marked wrong).
  - Eliminated letters now include: **A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S**.
  - Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- **Must include I** (since it's confirmed present), but **not in position 4**.
- Use **new, high-frequency letters** from the available set to maximize information (e.g., T, H, G, M, D).
- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize common English words.
- Given I must be repositioned, testing it in **position 2** (a common spot for I in 5-letter words) is a strong choice.

A good candidate is **""MIGHT""**:
- **M, I, G, H, T** → All letters are from the available set, and I is in position 2 (avoiding position 4).
- Tests common letters like T, H, and G, which haven't been tried yet.
- If I is correct in position 2, we'll get a ✓; if not, the feedback will help narrow its position further.

<guess>might</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: spoil -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) I(-) L(x)
Guess 3: might -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have three guesses with feedback:
1. ""crane"" -> All letters incorrect: C, R, A, N, E are absent.
2. ""spoil"" -> S, P, O, L absent; I is present but not in position 4.
3. ""might"" -> M, G, H absent; I is correct in position 2; T is present but not in position 5.

So, summarizing:
- **Definitely in the word**: I (specifically in position 2, since we got a ✓ for it in guess 3).
- **Letters present but position wrong**: T (from guess 3, T is in the word but not in position 5).
- **Eliminated letters**: A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S, M, G, H. (From guess 1 and 2, plus M, G, H from guess 3.)

Eliminated letters: A, C, E, G, H, L, M, N, O P, R, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, I, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: I is fixed in position 2, and T must be included somewhere but not in position 5.

Current knowledge:
- Position 2 is I (from the ✓ in guess 3).
- T is in the word, but not at position 5 (since in ""might"" at position 5 it was marked ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).

The word structure: _ I _ _ _

T can be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is wrong, and position 2 is taken by I).

We need to make a guess that:
- Has I in position 2.
- Includes T (which must be in position 1, 3, or 4).
- Uses only available letters: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word that fits.

Possible words? Let's think of words with structure: [T?] I [letter?] [letter?] [T?] — but T can't be in position 5, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Options:
- T in position 1: T I _ _ _
- T in position 3: _ I T _ _
- T in position 4: _ I _ T _

We also need to use new letters to test possibilities.

Given the available letters, let's consider:
- For T in position 1: ""TI..."" words? Examples: TIGER -> but G and E are eliminated. TIDAL -> D and A, but A eliminated. TIBIA -> B and I again? TIBIA has B and I, but position 4 is A -> eliminated. So hard.

Available: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Therefore, words must be formed from these letters.

Possibilities:
With T in position 1:
- ""TIGER"" not possible (G,E out).
- ""TIDAL"" not (A out).
- ""TIPSY"" -> T,I,P,S,Y. But P and S out. Invalid.
- ""TIZZY"" -> T,I,Z,Z,Y. Letters: T, I, Z, Z, Y. Available? Z and Y are available, but we have two Z's. Word ""tizzy"" means a state of agitation. It uses T, I, Z, Z, Y. So the second Z would duplicate? But we can use it. However, we are trying to test letters, and duplicate might limit information. But acceptable.

But we have eliminated letters: we must avoid P, S, etc.

Another: ""TICKY"" -> C and K? C is out. No.

""TIMED"" -> M,E,D -> M and E out.

""TIMID"" -> M and D; M out.

Available consonants: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So for T I _ _ _, we need valid letters. What about: ""TIKI"" is 4 letters? No. ""TILDE"" -> T,I,L,D,E -> L and E out.

Struggling with T in position 1.

Now T in position 3: _ I T _ _

Possible words: ""BIT TY""? Not. ""CITY"" too short. ""DITTY"" -> D,I,T,T,Y -> letters D,I,T,T,Y. Available? D, T, Y are available. ""Ditty"" is a 5-letter word meaning a short song. Positions: B1=I? Wait, word is D-I-T-T-Y, so position 3 is T, which is good. But we have two T's? The T at position 3 is fixed? No, in the word, position 3 is T and position 4 is T? So two T's.

But we know T is present, and if there are two T's, it's possible.

Similarly, ""BITT Y"" is two words? ""Bitty"" is a word meaning small. But ""bitty"" is B-I-T-T-Y -> positions 1:B, 2:I, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y. So same as above.

Again, duplicates.

""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> same letters.

""PITHY"" -> P is out.

So words like ""ditty"", ""bitty"", ""kitty"", ""witty"" (W,I,T,T,Y) — W is available, so ""witty"" could work.

But we have duplicates of T? Not necessarily a problem, but note that in feedback, we might get multiple marks.

But in guess 3, we have T only once, and it was marked ""-"", meaning at least one T is present. There could be more.

But to avoid duplicates for more information? We don't have to.

Another possibility: T in position 4: _ I _ T _

Words: ""QUI T T"" is ""quits"" would be Q,U,I,T,S but S out. ""QUIET"" -> Q,U,I,E,T -> E out. ""UNI T Y"" -> U,N,I,T,Y -> N out. So difficult.

We need to use the available letters.

Perhaps less common words: ""JIVED"" -> J,I,V,E,D -> E out. ""FIBER"" -> not. 

Since T is involved, and we need to place it elsewhere.

Perhaps ""DIZZY"" -> D,I,Z,Z,Y. But no T. But we need to include T because it is known to be present. So we must include T.

The word must contain T.

So missing T is not an option.

Therefore, consider the possibilities above.

Perhaps T in position 1 with available letters: ""TIKKA"" -> T,I,K,K,A -> A out. ""TWIXT"" -> T,W,I,X,T -> positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:X, 4:T? Or T,W,I,X,T? That's 5 letters? ""Twix T"" is two words? Actually, 'twixt is short for betwixt, but usually written with apostrophe. Not a standard 5-letter word. Probably not valid.

Another idea: ""DUVET"" -> D,U,V,E,T -> E out.

Let's think differently.

For position 1, we can put other available letters: B, D, F, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And include T in position 3 or 4.

For example:
- Word with position structure: _ I T _ _
  - Options: ""BIT TY"" = ""bitty"" -> B,I,T,T,Y -> letters: B, I, T, T, Y. Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y. Feedback: T is in position 3? And also position 4? We know T is present, but we don't know if multiple. However, we are testing.
- ""DITTY"" -> D,I,T,T,Y -> similar.

But ""ditty"" is D-I-T-T-Y. So T is in positions 3 and 4? That might be okay.

- ""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> K in position 1, T in 3 and 4.
- ""WITTY"" -> W,I,T,T,Y -> same.

Which one to choose? We need to test new letters.

""WITTY"" uses W (which we haven't tested) and Y.

Alternatively, to test different sets, let's pick ""BITTY"" because B is a common letter? But ""bitty"" might be less common, but it's accepted in Wordle.

Or ""DITTY""? D is common.

But we also have position 5 to consider.

Another word without duplicate: Is there a word with only one T?
For T in position 3: Structure _ I T _ _ 
Possible words with no duplicate letters.

""JITNEY"" too long? No, 5 letters? J-I-T-N-E-Y? 6 letters. Short words: ""CITY"" not 5. ""PITHY"" out due to P/H? H is eliminated? From guess 3, H is marked x in ""might"", so H is out.

H is eliminated.

Available letters: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Searching: ""BIGHT"" -> B,I,G,H,T -> G and H are both eliminated? From guess 3, G and H are x. So out.

""FIGHT"" -> F,I,G,H,T -> G and H out.

""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> duplicate T.

Similarly, ""DITTO"" -> O out.

""MITTS"" -> M and S out.

So it seems hard to find words without duplicates or without eliminated letters for the structure.

T in position 4: _ I _ T _
Possible words: ""QUI T E"" -> E out. ""QUI T S"" -> S out. ""DAILY"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> A and L out. ""DIET T"" -> D,I,E,T,T -> E out. ""PIETY"" -> P and E out.

""MINTY"" -> M and N out.

So the only feasible words seem to be with T in position 3 and another letter, but using duplicates? Or T in position 1 with less common combinations.

Try ""TIPSY"" -> but P and S out.

Perhaps ""TWIXT"" isn't valid. Let's find accepted words.

Another possibility: ""OUIJA"" -> O out. ""ADIEU"" -> A,E out.

What about ""BUY T"" not, ""JUST T"" not.

Let's consider that T might be in position 1 after all: ""TOUZY"" - not common. ""TAWNY"" - A and W? ""A"" eliminated. ""TUNNY"" - U,N,N,Y -> N out.

Not good.

Perhaps we missed a word: ""TWI T Y"" - 6 letters.

Or ""TAFFY"" -> T,A,F,F,Y -> A out.

Another idea: ""TU Y"" no.

We need to include U or other vowels.

Available vowels: Only left? U might be, Y is sometimes vowel.

""QUILL"" -> Q,U,I,L,L -> L out.

""BUILD"" -> B,U,I,L,D -> L out.

T is required.

Perhaps ""DUTY I"" no.

Let's list possible words:

With I fixed at position 2 and T included, and no eliminated letters:

- ""BITTY"" (B,I,T,T,Y) - valid
- ""DITTY"" (D,I,T,T,Y) - valid
- ""KITTY"" (K,I,T,T,Y) - valid
- ""WITTY"" (W,I,T,T,Y) - valid
- ""TITTY"" - not meaning, or offensive.

Also ""PIT T Y"" but P out.

So among B,D,K,W, which letters to test?

Since D and B are more common, we might choose ""DITTY"" or ""BITTY"".

""WITTY"" uses W, which is less common.

But we are trying to get information. ""DITTY"" uses D and Y, both new.

Similarly, ""KITTY"" uses K and Y.

To maximize new letters, let's pick ""DITTY"" because D is more flexible than K or W.

But we have duplicate T, so we know T is present, but feedback might not tell us how many if both T's are incorrect position or something.

In ""DITTY"", the T at position 3 and 4. But we know T is at least present, but in the secret word, it might be at position 1 or elsewhere? But in our structure, position 2 is I, so secret word is _ I _ _ _, so T could be at 1,3,4.

In ""DITTY"", if we have T at 3 and 4, but if the secret word has T at position 1, for example, then the T we see might only be placed at position 1, and we get feedback accordingly.

Similarly, if secret word has T at position 3, our T at 3 might be ✓, etc.

So we can try it.

Perhaps ""TAWPY"" -> not a word? ""JAW T Y"" no.

""JUICED"" -> J,U,I,C,E -> C and E out.

Not found other words.

Therefore, we go with ""DITTY"".

But ""ditty"" has two T's, but we are testing.

To be safe, we can use ""WITTY"" to test W, but B is perhaps more common.

But D is letter.

So let's choose ""BITTY"" or ""DITTY"". I'll pick ""dITTY"" with first letter D.

No, ""DITTY"" starts with D.

Or to include more unique letters, ""QUIP T"" not.

Another word: ""FU T Z Y""? But Z and Y? ""FUTZY"" is not common? ""Futzy"" might be slang. Probably not accepted.

""TA V V Y"" no.

So stick with the realistic ones.

We'll guess ""DITTY"".

But note the feedback may be messy with duplicates, but it's permissible.

<guess>ditty</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters absent (x), eliminating **C, R, A, N, E**.
- **Guess 2: spoil** → **S, P, O, L** absent (x), **I** present but wrong position (-). This confirms the word contains **I**, but not in position 4.
- **Guess 3: might** → **M, G, H** absent (x), **I** correct in position 2 (✓), **T** present but wrong position (-). This confirms:
  - Position 2 is **I**.
  - The word contains **T**, but not in position 5.

### Current knowledge:
- **Fixed position**: Position 2 is **I** → Word structure: `[ ? ] I [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ]`.
- **Confirmed present letters**: **I** (position 2), **T** (somewhere not position 5).
- **Eliminated letters**: **A, C, E, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, R, S** (from all feedback).
- **Available letters**: **B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.
- **Constraints**:
  - **T** must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is taken and position 5 is wrong).
  - Must include **T**.

### Strategy:
- Focus on **T** placement: Test **T** in position 3 or 4 (position 1 is less feasible with available letters).
- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., **D, Y, B, W**).
- Consider common word patterns. Words like **BITTY**, **DITTY**, or **WITTY** fit the structure but may have duplicate letters (e.g., double **T**). Feedback will still provide valuable positional insights.
- Choose **DITTY** as the next guess:
  - Structure: **D I T T Y**
    - Position 1: **D** (new letter, tests common consonant).
    - Position 2: **I** (correct, confirmed).
    - Position 3: **T** (tests position 3).
    - Position 4: **T** (duplicate **T**, tests position 4).
    - Position 5: **Y** (new letter, tests common vowel-sound).
  - **DITTY** is a valid English word (meaning a short, simple song).
  - Tests **T** in both position 3 and 4 efficiently, while introducing **D** and **Y**.

<guess>ditty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: might -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)
Guess 4: ditty -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the fourth guess: ""ditty"" -> D(x) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)
This means:
- D is not in the word (x)
- I is in the correct position (we already knew this was position 2)
- T is in the correct position (position 3)
- T is in the correct position (position 4) - note that ""ditty"" has two T's: one at position 3 and one at position 4. Both are marked correct, so T is at position 3 and position 4 in the secret word.
- Y is in the correct position (position 5)

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown (but not D, and not any eliminated letter)
- Position 2: I (known)
- Position 3: T (known)
- Position 4: T (known)
- Position 5: Y (known)

So the word is of the form: _ I T T Y

Now we know the entire word except the first letter. The secret word is ?ITTY.

We also have the eliminated letters from previous guesses: 
From guess 1: C, R, A, N, E 
From guess 2: S, P, O, L 
From guess 3: M, G, H 
From guess 4: D 

Additionally, we had eliminated: A,C,E,G,H,L,M,N,O,P,R,S and now D.

Available letters are: B, F, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and note we haven't used B but it is available).

But we must form a word that ends with ITTY. Common words are:
- BITTY (but B is available, and we haven't eliminated B)
- KITTY 
- WITTY 
- PITTY (but P is eliminated) 
- etc.

In our current feedback for guess 4, we used ""ditty"" and D was incorrect. So the first letter is not D. Also, we know the word must be a 5-letter English word.

Possible candidates:
- BITTY: meaning small or fragmented.
- KITTY: meaning a fund of money or a young cat.
- WITTY: meaning clever and funny.
- MITTY: not common (and M is eliminated)
- FITTY: not common (slang? but perhaps not)
- JITTY: not common (variant of jetty? but 5 letters? j-i-t-t-y? not really)
- QITTY: not a word
- VITTY: not a word
- ZITTY: not common, but might be used for acne? Not standard.

Valid English words ending in ITTY: 
- BITTY: accepted in word games
- KITTY: accepted
- WITTY: accepted
- TITTY: not appropriate and often excluded from word lists.

Given that D is eliminated and we have W and K available, we need to choose between BITTY, KITTY, WITTY.

But note: we are allowed only one more guess? We have used 4 guesses, so we have 2 left? But the prompt says ""new guess"", so we can try one.

However, we need to make a guess that is a valid word. We can guess any one of these, and the goal is to solve it.

But let's see what letters we haven't tested: We have used many letters and eliminated others. We don't have any other constraints.

So we can guess:
- BITTY
- KITTY
- WITTY

Any of these could be the secret word? But we don't know.

We must choose one to guess.

To decide, note that we haven't used B, K, W. We might try one that tests a new letter.

But since we know the word is ?ITTY, and we have three candidates, we have to pick one.

Perhaps we can use the fact that in guess 2, we had I at position 4 but it was wrong. Now, the word has I at position 2 (fixed), T at 3 and 4 (both fixed), and Y at 5 (fixed). So the first letter must be one that forms a valid word.

Given that, we can guess KITTY? Or BITTY? They are all valid.

But let's note: in guess 3, we had T at position 5, which was marked wrong position. But now we have T at position 3 and 4. Why was T marked wrong at position 5? Because it is not at position 5? But now we have two T's? Actually, the secret word has two T's: at positions 3 and 4. Therefore, if we had guessed T at position 5, it would be marked as not present in that position, which is consistent. So no issue.

Now, we have three options: B, K, W. We don't have any more feedback to distinguish.

Thus, we must pick one. We can choose BITTY because B is a common consonant? Or arbitrarily.

Perhaps the secret word does not have duplicate letters? But in this case, KITTY and BITTY also have duplicate T's? Actually, all candidates have I, T, T, Y and then the first letter. So all have duplicate T's.

Therefore, we choose BITTY? Or we can choose the most common.

Word frequency: ""kitten"" might be more common, but ""kitty"" is acceptable. ""Bitty"" is less common. ""Witty"" is adjective.

Since we have no clues, we pick one.

But note: we must avoid eliminated letters. We haven't eliminated B, K, or W.

We'll guess ""KITTY"" because it is a standard word.

But let's make sure: ""k"" is available? Yes.

Alternatively, to save a guess? We have two guesses left, but we can hit it.

Another thing: in guess 4 we guessed ""ditty"", which had T at position 3 and 4, and got T(✓) for both, meaning those positions are T. So the secret word has T at 3 and 4. Then Y at 5, I at 2. So only position 1 is missing.

Therefore, we can guess any word of the form ?ITTY, and we have options: B (for BITTY), K (for KITTY), W (for WITTY).

We don't know which. We have to pick one.

Perhaps to get feedback? We are forced to guess one of them.

But if we guess KITTY, and if it's correct, we win. Otherwise, we'll know it's one of the others.

Similarly.

Let's guess ""kitty"".

We'll guess KITTY.Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- **Position 2 is fixed as I** (confirmed in guess 3: ""might"" → I(✓)).
- **Position 3 is fixed as T** (confirmed in guess 4: ""ditty"" → T(✓) at position 3).
- **Position 4 is fixed as T** (confirmed in guess 4: ""ditty"" → T(✓) at position 4).
- **Position 5 is fixed as Y** (confirmed in guess 4: ""ditty"" → Y(✓)).
- **Position 1 is the only unknown**, and it cannot be any of the eliminated letters: **A, C, D, E, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, R, S** (from cumulative feedback). Available letters for position 1 include **B, F, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z**.

The secret word must therefore be of the form `[?] I T T Y`, where `?` is a letter from the available set. Common English words matching this pattern are:
- **BITTY** (meaning fragmentary or small)
- **KITTY** (meaning a fund or a young cat)
- **WITTY** (meaning clever and humorous)

Given that:
- We have two remaining guesses to solve the puzzle.
- Prioritizing **high-frequency starting consonants** (like B or K) helps test more common candidates first.
- **BITTY** introduces **B**, a common letter not yet tested, providing critical information even if incorrect.

Thus, **BITTY** is the optimal next guess to maximize the chance of solving or narrowing the possibilities.

The first word I guessed was ""crane"", and all letters got an ""x"", meaning none of them—C, R, A, N, E—are in the secret word. That\'s actually quite helpful, even though it might seem disappointing. It means I can eliminate those letters entirely from consideration. \n\nNow, knowing what letters to avoid, I\'m thinking about what other common letters could be in the word. The vowels A and E are out, so I should focus on other vowels like I, O, U, and common consonants that weren\'t used. Letters like S, T, L, and others come to mind. A word that uses different vowels and consonants would be ideal.\n\nI recall that ""ships"" is a word, but it has an S at the end and might be too common. Wait, no—I need to pick something with no repeated letters ideally, since duplicates might complicate feedback. How about ""spoil""? It uses S, P, O, I, L—all unique and include new letters. O and I are vowels, which can help narrow down possibilities. \n\nAlternatively, ""pious"" comes to mind, but that has S at the end too. Words like ""light"", ""might"", ""fight"" are options, but they share several letters. Since C, R, A, N, E are out, I should avoid words containing those. ""Light"" has L, I, G, H, T—all unused letters, so it has high potential. \n\nBut maybe a word with O and U? Like ""round"", but ""round"" includes R and N, which are excluded. Oops, I have to stick to letters not in the excluded set. So R is out? Yes, from the first feedback. \n\nOkay, listing possible candidates: ""spoil"", ""plumb"", ""sight"", ""fight"", ""might"". Among these, ""spoil"" introduces S, P, O, I, L—all unguessed letters. It has good coverage and includes vowels and consonants. Seems solid. \n\nAlternatively, ""sound"" uses S, O, U, N, D—but N is excluded, so that won\'t work. N was in the first guess and got an x, so it\'s out. So ""sound"" is invalid. \n\n""Patch"" uses P, A, T, C, H—A and C are excluded, so that won\'t work either. \n\nSo I think ""spoil"" is a safe choice—it introduces five completely new letters and covers diverse letters. \n\nLet\'s confirm: excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E. \n\nSo ""spoil"": S is new, P is new, O is new, I is new, L is new. Perfect. \n\nI\'ll go with ""spoil"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x)), we know the secret word contains **none of these letters**: **C, R, A, N, or E**. This means:\n- **Vowels**: We must avoid A/E and focus on other vowels (e.g., I, O, U) or vowel-like consonants.\n- **Consonants**: We need to prioritize other common English letters like S, T, L, P, M, etc.\n\nFor the next guess, I\'ll choose a word that:\n1. Uses **all new letters**, avoiding C/R/A/N/E entirely.\n2. Includes **high-frequency letters** (like S, T, L, O, I) to maximize information gain.\n3. Balances vowels and consonants to test new possibilities.\n\nA strong candidate is **""SPOIL""** because:\n- It introduces **5 new letters**: **S, P, O, I, L**.\n- It includes **two vowels (O, I)** and three consonants (S, P, L).\n- **S** and **L** are among the most common English consonants, while **O/I** are common vowels.\n\nAfter submitting **""SPOIL""**, we\'ll use the feedback to narrow down possibilities further.\n\n<guess>spoil</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spoil -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) I(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses with feedback:\n1.

The excluded letters are: A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S.\n\nRemaining letters: We have to choose from the rest of the alphabet. Let\'s list the available letters:\nB, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut note: I is already known to be in the word, so we must include it. Also, we have to form a valid English word.\n\nWe need to make a new guess that:\n- Includes the letter I (but not in the 4th position, because in ""spoil"" it was at position 4 and was wrong position, so it must be in a different position).\n- Uses only the available letters (so no A, C, E, L, N, O, P, R, S).\n\nWe also want to test other common letters to get more information. Common letters we haven\'t tried yet: T, U, D, H, M, etc.\n\nPossible positions for I: Since it can\'t be in position 4, we can try it in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have I and are made of the available letters.\n\nFor example:\n- Words with I at the start: ""itchy"" -> but we have to check letters. I, T, C, H, Y. But C is excluded (from first guess). So not valid.\n- Another: ""input"" -> but P and N are excluded.\n\nWe must avoid excluded letters.\n\nLet\'s try words with I in the second position? For example, ""bight"" (meaning a bend or curve). Letters: B, I, G, H, T. All these are available (B, I, G, H, T not excluded). And I is in position 2.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has B, G, H, T, but they are available.\n\nAnother possibility: ""digit"" -> D, I, G, I, T. But we have two I\'s? The word ""digit"" has two I\'s? No, ""digit"" is D-I-G-I-T? Actually, it\'s D-I-G-I-T, so two I\'s? But the secret word might have two I\'s? We don\'t know. But in our feedback, we only know that at least one I is present. However, we must be cautious.\n\nBut let\'s check: ""digit"" has D, I, G, I, T. The excluded letters don\'t include D, G, T, and I is allowed. But we have to see if it\'s valid.\n\nBut we are not sure about the frequency. We might want to avoid repeating letters for now to get more information.\n\nAlternatively, ""midst"" -> but S is excluded.\n\nAnother idea: ""light"" -> but L is excluded (from ""spoil"" feedback, L is x).\n\nL is excluded.\n\nLet\'s think of words without the excluded letters.\n\nAvailable: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need a word that includes I and four other letters from this set.\n\nSome words:\n- ""FIGHT"": F, I, G, H, T. All available? F, I, G, H, T are not excluded. And I is in position 2.\n- ""THIGH"": T, H, I, G, H. This has two H\'s? And I in position 3. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. We can use it, but it might be less informative if there are duplicates.\n- ""WIGHT"": W, I, G, H, T. (a mythical being). I in position 2.\n- ""MIGHT"": M, I, G, H, T. I in position 2.\n- ""DIGHT"": D, I, G, H, T. (archaic word meaning to adorn). I in position 2.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has F, W, M, D, etc. But we are trying to test new letters.\n\nWe also have to consider that I might be in other positions.\n\nFor example, I in position 1: ""itchy"" is invalid because of C. ""inbox"" -> I, N, B, O, X. But N and O are excluded. ""input"" -> P excluded. So hard to find words with I in position 1 without excluded letters.\n\nI in position 3: ""habit"" -> H, A, B, I, T. But A is excluded. ""orbit"" -> O and B? O excluded. ""posit"" -> P and S excluded. So difficult.\n\nI in position 5: ""taxi"" is 4 letters. ""sushi"" -> S excluded. ""tutti"" -> T, U, T, T, I. But T is repeated. And U is available. But we can try.\n\nBut perhaps it\'s easier to try I in position 2.\n\nSo let\'s go with a word that has I in position 2 and uses other common available letters.\n\nCommon available letters: T, H, G, D, M, etc.\n\nI think ""MIGHT"" is a good candidate because:\n- It uses M, I, G, H, T. All new letters.\n- It tests T and H which are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""FIGHT"" is also good.\n\nBut we have to choose one. Let\'s pick ""MIGHT"".\n\nWe can also consider ""THUMB"" but that doesn\'t have I. We must include I.\n\nAnother word: ""DIZZY"" -> D, I, Z, Z, Y. But Z is uncommon and repeated. Not ideal.\n\n""JIFFY"" -> J, I, F, F, Y. Repeated F.\n\nSo ""MIGHT"" seems solid.\n\nBut note: in ""spoil"", I was in position 4 and got a ""-"", meaning I is in the word but not at position 4. In ""MIGHT"", I is at position 2. That\'s a different position, so it\'s allowed.\n\nWe\'ll guess ""MIGHT"" and see the feedback.\n\n<guess>might</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these letters are eliminated.\n- **Guess 2: spoil** → Letters S, P, O, L are absent (x), and I is present but in the wrong position (-).

Examples: TIGER -> but G and E are eliminated. TIDAL -> D and A, but A eliminated. TIBIA -> B and I again? TIBIA has B and I, but position 4 is A -> eliminated. So hard.\n\nAvailable: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nTherefore, words must be formed from these letters.\n\nPossibilities:\nWith T in position 1:\n- ""TIGER"" not possible (G,E out).\n- ""TIDAL"" not (A out).\n- ""TIPSY"" -> T,I,P,S,Y. But P and S out. Invalid.\n- ""TIZZY"" -> T,I,Z,Z,Y. Letters: T, I, Z, Z, Y. Available? Z and Y are available, but we have two Z\'s. Word ""tizzy"" means a state of agitation. It uses T, I, Z, Z, Y. So the second Z would duplicate? But we can use it. However, we are trying to test letters, and duplicate might limit information. But acceptable.\n\nBut we have eliminated letters: we must avoid P, S, etc.\n\nAnother: ""TICKY"" -> C and K? C is out. No.\n\n""TIMED"" -> M,E,D -> M and E out.\n\n""TIMID"" -> M and D; M out.\n\nAvailable consonants: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nSo for T I _ _ _, we need valid letters. What about: ""TIKI"" is 4 letters? No. ""TILDE"" -> T,I,L,D,E -> L and E out.\n\nStruggling with T in position 1.\n\nNow T in position 3: _ I T _ _\n\nPossible words: ""BIT TY""? Not. ""CITY"" too short. ""DITTY"" -> D,I,T,T,Y -> letters D,I,T,T,Y. Available? D, T, Y are available. ""Ditty"" is a 5-letter word meaning a short song. Positions: B1=I? Wait, word is D-I-T-T-Y, so position 3 is T, which is good. But we have two T\'s? The T at position 3 is fixed? No, in the word, position 3 is T and position 4 is T? So two T\'s.\n\nBut we know T is present, and if there are two T\'s, it\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""BITT Y"" is two words? ""Bitty"" is a word meaning small. But ""bitty"" is B-I-T-T-Y -> positions 1:B, 2:I, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y. So same as above.\n\nAgain, duplicates.\n\n""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> same letters.\n\n""PITHY"" -> P is out.\n\nSo words like ""ditty"", ""bitty"", ""kitty"", ""witty"" (W,I,T,T,Y) — W is available, so ""witty"" could work.\n\nBut we have duplicates of T? Not necessarily a problem, but note that in feedback, we might get multiple marks.\n\nBut in guess 3, we have T only once, and it was marked ""-"", meaning at least one T is present. There could be more.\n\nBut to avoid duplicates for more information? We don\'t have to.\n\nAnother possibility: T in position 4: _ I _ T _\n\nWords: ""QUI T T"" is ""quits"" would be Q,U,I,T,S but S out. ""QUIET"" -> Q,U,I,E,T -> E out. ""UNI T Y"" -> U,N,I,T,Y -> N out. So difficult.\n\nWe need to use the available letters.\n\nPerhaps less common words: ""JIVED"" -> J,I,V,E,D -> E out. ""FIBER"" -> not. \n\nSince T is involved, and we need to place it elsewhere.\n\nPerhaps ""DIZZY"" -> D,I,Z,Z,Y. But no T. But we need to include T because it is known to be present. So we must include T.\n\nThe word must contain T.\n\nSo missing T is not an option.\n\nTherefore, consider the possibilities above.\n\nPerhaps T in position 1 with available letters: ""TIKKA"" -> T,I,K,K,A -> A out. ""TWIXT"" -> T,W,I,X,T -> positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:X, 4:T? Or T,W,I,X,T? That\'s 5 letters? ""Twix T"" is two words? Actually, \'twixt is short for betwixt, but usually written with apostrophe. Not a standard 5-letter word. Probably not valid.\n\nAnother idea: ""DUVET"" -> D,U,V,E,T -> E out.\n\nLet\'s think differently.\n\nFor position 1, we can put other available letters: B, D, F, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nAnd include T in position 3 or 4.\n\nFor example:\n- Word with position structure: _ I T _ _\n  - Options: ""BIT TY"" = ""bitty"" -> B,I,T,T,Y -> letters: B, I, T, T, Y. Positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:T, 4:T, 5:Y. Feedback: T is in position 3? And also position 4? We know T is present, but we don\'t know if multiple. However, we are testing.\n- ""DITTY"" -> D,I,T,T,Y -> similar.\n\nBut ""ditty"" is D-I-T-T-Y. So T is in positions 3 and 4? That might be okay.\n\n- ""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> K in position 1, T in 3 and 4.\n- ""WITTY"" -> W,I,T,T,Y -> same.\n\nWhich one to choose? We need to test new letters.\n\n""WITTY"" uses W (which we haven\'t tested) and Y.\n\nAlternatively, to test different sets, let\'s pick ""BITTY"" because B is a common letter? But ""bitty"" might be less common, but it\'s accepted in Wordle.\n\nOr ""DITTY""? D is common.\n\nBut we also have position 5 to consider.\n\nAnother word without duplicate: Is there a word with only one T?\nFor T in position 3: Structure _ I T _ _ \nPossible words with no duplicate letters.\n\n""JITNEY"" too long? No, 5 letters? J-I-T-N-E-Y? 6 letters. Short words: ""CITY"" not 5. ""PITHY"" out due to P/H? H is eliminated? From guess 3, H is marked x in ""might"", so H is out.\n\nH is eliminated.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nSearching: ""BIGHT"" -> B,I,G,H,T -> G and H are both eliminated? From guess 3, G and H are x. So out.\n\n""FIGHT"" -> F,I,G,H,T -> G and H out.\n\n""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y -> duplicate T.\n\nSimilarly, ""DITTO"" -> O out.\n\n""MITTS"" -> M and S out.\n\nSo it seems hard to find words without duplicates or without eliminated letters for the structure.\n\nT in position 4: _ I _ T _\nPossible words: ""QUI T E"" -> E out. ""QUI T S"" -> S out. ""DAILY"" -> D,A,I,L,Y -> A and L out. ""DIET T"" -> D,I,E,T,T -> E out. ""PIETY"" -> P and E out.\n\n""MINTY"" -> M and N out.\n\nSo the only feasible words seem to be with T in position 3 and another letter, but using duplicates? Or T in position 1 with less common combinations.\n\nTry ""TIPSY"" -> but P and S out.\n\nPerhaps ""TWIXT"" isn\'t valid. Let\'s find accepted words.\n\nAnother possibility: ""OUIJA"" -> O out. ""ADIEU"" -> A,E out.\n\nWhat about ""BUY T"" not, ""JUST T"" not.\n\nLet\'s consider that T might be in position 1 after all: ""TOUZY"" - not common. ""TAWNY"" - A and W? ""A"" eliminated. ""TUNNY"" - U,N,N,Y -> N out.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps we missed a word: ""TWI T Y"" - 6 letters.\n\nOr ""TAFFY"" -> T,A,F,F,Y -> A out.\n\nAnother idea: ""TU Y"" no.\n\nWe need to include U or other vowels.\n\nAvailable vowels: Only left? U might be, Y is sometimes vowel.\n\n""QUILL"" -> Q,U,I,L,L -> L out.\n\n""BUILD"" -> B,U,I,L,D -> L out.\n\nT is required.\n\nPerhaps ""DUTY I"" no.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\nWith I fixed at position 2 and T included, and no eliminated letters:\n\n- ""BITTY"" (B,I,T,T,Y) - valid\n- ""DITTY"" (D,I,T,T,Y) - valid\n- ""KITTY"" (K,I,T,T,Y) - valid\n- ""WITTY"" (W,I,T,T,Y) - valid\n- ""TITTY"" - not meaning, or offensive.\n\nAlso ""PIT T Y"" but P out.\n\nSo among B,D,K,W, which letters to test?\n\nSince D and B are more common, we might choose ""DITTY"" or ""BITTY"".\n\n""WITTY"" uses W, which is less common.\n\nBut we are trying to get information. ""DITTY"" uses D and Y, both new.\n\nSimilarly, ""KITTY"" uses K and Y.\n\nTo maximize new letters, let\'s pick ""DITTY"" because D is more flexible than K or W.\n\nBut we have duplicate T, so we know T is present, but feedback might not tell us how many if both T\'s are incorrect position or something.\n\nIn ""DITTY"", the T at position 3 and 4. But we know T is at least present, but in the secret word, it might be at position 1 or elsewhere? But in our structure, position 2 is I, so secret word is _ I _ _ _, so T could be at 1,3,4.\n\nIn ""DITTY"", if we have T at 3 and 4, but if the secret word has T at position 1, for example, then the T we see might only be placed at position 1, and we get feedback accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, if secret word has T at position 3, our T at 3 might be ✓, etc.\n\nSo we can try it.\n\nPerhaps ""TAWPY"" -> not a word? ""JAW T Y"" no.\n\n""JUICED"" -> J,U,I,C,E -> C and E out.\n\nNot found other words.\n\nTherefore, we go with ""DITTY"".\n\nBut ""ditty"" has two T\'s, but we are testing.\n\nTo be safe, we can use ""WITTY"" to test W, but B is perhaps more common.\n\nBut D is letter.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""BITTY"" or ""DITTY"". I\'ll pick ""dITTY"" with first letter D.\n\nNo, ""DITTY"" starts with D.\n\nOr to include more unique letters, ""QUIP T"" not.\n\nAnother word: ""FU T Z Y""? But Z and Y? ""FUTZY"" is not common? ""Futzy"" might be slang. Probably not accepted.\n\n""TA V V Y"" no.\n\nSo stick with the realistic ones.\n\nWe\'ll guess ""DITTY"".\n\nBut note the feedback may be messy with duplicates, but it\'s permissible.\n\n<guess>ditty</guess>Based on the previous feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters absent (x), eliminating **C, R, A, N, E**.\n- **Guess 2: spoil** → **S, P, O, L** absent (x), **I** present but wrong position (-). This confirms the word contains **I**, but not in position 4.\n- **Guess 3: might** → **M, G, H** absent (x), **I** correct in position 2 (✓), **T** present but wrong position (-). This confirms:\n  - Position 2 is **I**.\n  - The word contains **T**, but not in position 5.\n\n### Current knowledge:\n- **Fixed position**: Position 2 is **I** → Word structure: `[ ? ] I [ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ]`.\n- **Confirmed present letters**: **I** (position 2), **T** (somewhere not position 5).\n- **Eliminated letters**: **A, C, E, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, R, S** (from all feedback).\n- **Available letters**: **B, D, F, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.\n- **Constraints**:\n  - **T** must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is taken and position 5 is wrong).\n  - Must include **T**.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Focus on **T** placement: Test **T** in position 3 or 4 (position 1 is less feasible with available letters).\n- Avoid eliminated letters and prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., **D, Y, B, W**).\n- Consider common word patterns. Words like **BITTY**, **DITTY**, or **WITTY** fit the structure but may have duplicate letters (e.g., double **T**). Feedback will still provide valuable positional insights.\n- Choose **DITTY** as the next guess:\n  - Structure: **D I T T Y**\n    - Position 1: **D** (new letter, tests common consonant).\n    - Position 2: **I** (correct, confirmed).\n    - Position 3: **T** (tests position 3).\n    - Position 4: **T** (duplicate **T**, tests position 4).\n    - Position 5: **Y** (new letter, tests common vowel-sound).\n  - **DITTY** is a valid English word (meaning a short, simple song).\n  - Tests **T** in both position 3 and 4 efficiently, while introducing **D** and **Y**.\n\n<guess>ditty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spoil -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) I(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: might -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)\nGuess 4: ditty -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the feedback for the fourth guess: ""ditty"" -> D(x) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)\nThis means:\n- D is not in the word (x)\n- I is in the correct position (we already knew this was position 2)\n- T is in the correct position (position 3)\n- T is in the correct position (position 4) - note that ""ditty"" has two T\'s: one at position 3 and one at position 4. Both are marked correct, so T is at position 3 and position 4 in the secret word.\n- Y is in the correct position (position 5)\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Position 1: unknown (but not D, and not any eliminated letter)\n- Position 2: I (known)\n- Position 3: T (known)\n- Position 4: T (known)\n- Position 5: Y (known)\n\nSo the word is of the form: _ I T T Y\n\nNow we know the entire word except the first letter. The secret word is ?ITTY.\n\nWe also have the eliminated letters from previous guesses: \nFrom guess 1: C, R, A, N, E \nFrom guess 2: S, P, O, L \nFrom guess 3: M, G, H \nFrom guess 4: D \n\nAdditionally, we had eliminated: A,C,E,G,H,L,M,N,O,P,R,S and now D.\n\nAvailable letters are: B, F, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and note we haven\'t used B but it is available).\n\nBut we must form a word that ends with ITTY. Common words are:\n- BITTY (but B is available, and we haven\'t eliminated B)\n- KITTY \n- WITTY \n- PITTY (but P is eliminated) \n- etc.\n\nIn our current feedback for guess 4, we used ""ditty"" and D was incorrect. So the first letter is not D. Also, we know the word must be a 5-letter English word.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- BITTY: meaning small or fragmented.\n- KITTY: meaning a fund of money or a young cat.\n- WITTY: meaning clever and funny.\n- MITTY: not common (and M is eliminated)\n- FITTY: not common (slang? but perhaps not)\n- JITTY: not common (variant of jetty? but 5 letters? j-i-t-t-y? not really)\n- QITTY: not a word\n- VITTY: not a word\n- ZITTY: not common, but might be used for acne? Not standard.\n\nValid English words ending in ITTY: \n- BITTY: accepted in word games\n- KITTY: accepted\n- WITTY: accepted\n- TITTY: not appropriate and often excluded from word lists.\n\nGiven that D is eliminated and we have W and K available, we need to choose between BITTY, KITTY, WITTY.\n\nBut note: we are allowed only one more guess? We have used 4 guesses, so we have 2 left? But the prompt says ""new guess"", so we can try one.\n\nHowever, we need to make a guess that is a valid word. We can guess any one of these, and the goal is to solve it.\n\nBut let\'s see what letters we haven\'t tested: We have used many letters and eliminated others. We don\'t have any other constraints.\n\nSo we can guess:\n- BITTY\n- KITTY\n- WITTY\n\nAny of these could be the secret word? But we don\'t know.\n\nWe must choose one to guess.\n\nTo decide, note that we haven\'t used B, K, W. We might try one that tests a new letter.\n\nBut since we know the word is ?ITTY, and we have three candidates, we have to pick one.\n\nPerhaps we can use the fact that in guess 2, we had I at position 4 but it was wrong. Now, the word has I at position 2 (fixed), T at 3 and 4 (both fixed), and Y at 5 (fixed). So the first letter must be one that forms a valid word.\n\nGiven that, we can guess KITTY? Or BITTY? They are all valid.\n\nBut let\'s note: in guess 3, we had T at position 5, which was marked wrong position. But now we have T at position 3 and 4. Why was T marked wrong at position 5? Because it is not at position 5? But now we have two T\'s? Actually, the secret word has two T\'s: at positions 3 and 4. Therefore, if we had guessed T at position 5, it would be marked as not present in that position, which is consistent. So no issue.\n\nNow, we have three options: B, K, W. We don\'t have any more feedback to distinguish.\n\nThus, we must pick one. We can choose BITTY because B is a common consonant? Or arbitrarily.\n\nPerhaps the secret word does not have duplicate letters? But in this case, KITTY and BITTY also have duplicate T\'s? Actually, all candidates have I, T, T, Y and then the first letter. So all have duplicate T\'s.\n\nTherefore, we choose BITTY? Or we can choose the most common.\n\nWord frequency: ""kitten"" might be more common, but ""kitty"" is acceptable. ""Bitty"" is less common. ""Witty"" is adjective.\n\nSince we have no clues, we pick one.\n\nBut note: we must avoid eliminated letters. We haven\'t eliminated B, K, or W.\n\nWe\'ll guess ""KITTY"" because it is a standard word.\n\nBut let\'s make sure: ""k"" is available? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, to save a guess? We have two guesses left, but we can hit it.\n\nAnother thing: in guess 4 we guessed ""ditty"", which had T at position 3 and 4, and got T(✓) for both, meaning those positions are T. So the secret word has T at 3 and 4. Then Y at 5, I at 2. So only position 1 is missing.\n\nTherefore, we can guess any word of the form ?ITTY, and we have options: B (for BITTY), K (for KITTY), W (for WITTY).\n\nWe don\'t know which. We have to pick one.\n\nPerhaps to get feedback? We are forced to guess one of them.\n\nBut if we guess KITTY, and if it\'s correct, we win. Otherwise, we\'ll know it\'s one of the others.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nLet\'s guess ""kitty"".\n\nWe\'ll guess KITTY.Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:\n\n- **Position 2 is fixed as I** (confirmed in guess 3: ""might"" → I(✓)).\n- **Position 3 is fixed as T** (confirmed in guess 4: ""ditty"" → T(✓) at position 3).\n- **Position 4 is fixed as T** (confirmed in guess 4: ""ditty"" → T(✓) at position 4).\n- **Position 5 is fixed as Y** (confirmed in guess 4: ""ditty"" → Y(✓)).\n- **Position 1 is the only unknown**, and it cannot be any of the eliminated letters: **A, C, D, E, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, R, S** (from cumulative feedback). Available letters for position 1 include **B, F, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z**.\n\nThe secret word must therefore be of the form `[?] I T T Y`, where `?` is a letter from the available set. Common English words matching this pattern are:\n- **BITTY** (meaning fragmentary or small)\n- **KITTY** (meaning a fund or a young cat)\n- **WITTY** (meaning clever and humorous)\n\nGiven that:\n- We have two remaining guesses to solve the puzzle.\n- Prioritizing **high-frequency starting consonants** (like B or K) helps test more common candidates first.\n- **BITTY** introduces **B**, a common letter not yet tested, providing critical information even if incorrect.\n\nThus, **BITTY** is the optimal next guess to maximize the chance of solving or narrowing the possibilities.\n\n<guess>bitty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spoil -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) I(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: might -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)\nGuess 4: ditty -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: bitty -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback for guess 5: ""bitty"" -> B(x) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)
This means:
- B is not in the word (x)
- I is correct at position 2 (✓)
- T is correct at position 3 (✓)
- T is correct at position 4 (✓) - note that the word has two T's, and both are correct at their positions.
- Y is correct at position 5 (✓)

So the secret word is of the form: _ I T T Y

We know position 2 is I, position 3 is T, position 4 is T, position 5 is Y. Only position 1 is unknown.

From the feedback, B is not the first letter (and not in the word at all).

Eliminated letters so far (from all guesses):
- From guess 1: C, R, A, N, E
- From guess 2: S, P, O, L
- From guess 3: M, G, H
- From guess 4: D
- From guess 5: B

So eliminated: A, B, C, D, E, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, R, S

Available letters for position 1: F, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: Y is already at position 5, so it can be at position 1? Yes, but the word would be YITTY, which is not a common word. Similarly, we need to form a valid English word.

Possible words ending with ITTY: 
- We had BITTY (but B is eliminated, so not)
- KITTY (K is available)
- WITTY (W is available)
- Other possibilities? 
  - FITTY: not a standard word (slang, but might not be in word list)
  - JITTY: not common (might be a variant of jetty, but jetty is 5 letters? j-e-t-t-y, not j-i-t-t-y)
  - KITTY and WITTY are the main ones.

Also, MITTY is not possible because M is eliminated.

So the only common words are KITTY and WITTY.

We have two options: K or W for the first letter.

We have one guess left (since we are on guess 6 now).

We must choose between KITTY and WITTY.

To decide, note that we haven't tested K or W in any previous guesses. We have no information about them.

But we can choose arbitrarily. Let's pick KITTY because it might be more common? Or WITTY.

Since we have to pick one, we can choose KITTY.

But let's see: in the context, we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can consider that in guess 2, we had I at position 4, which was wrong, but that doesn't help now.

We'll guess ""kitty"".

But note: if we guess ""kitty"" and it's wrong, we lose, but we have one more guess? No, this is the sixth guess? We have used 5 guesses, so this is the 6th and final guess.

We must be correct.

But we don't know if it's KITTY or WITTY.

We need to think: is there any other word?

What about ""TITTY""? But that is often excluded from word games due to being offensive. So probably not.

""PITTY"" is not a word; the correct spelling is ""pity"", which is 4 letters.

""MITTY"" is not possible (M eliminated).

""VITTY"" not a word.

So only KITTY and WITTY are plausible.

But we have to choose one. We can look at the frequency? ""Kitty"" might be more common as a word.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that in the available letters, we have U, but no word ""UITTY"".

So we must pick.

I think we should guess ""kitty"".

But let's see the previous feedback: in guess 3, we had ""might"" and T was marked wrong at position 5. Now, if the word is KITTY, it has no T at position 5, so that's consistent. Similarly for WITTY.

No additional clue.

So we'll go with ""kitty"".

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Current Word Structure from Feedback**:
   - Position 2 is **I** (confirmed correct in Guess 3 and again in Guess 4 and 5).
   - Position 3 is **T** (confirmed correct in Guess 4 and again in Guess 5).
   - Position 4 is **T** (confirmed correct in Guess 4 and again in Guess 5).
   - Position 5 is **Y** (confirmed correct in Guess 4 and again in Guess 5).
   - Position 1 is the **only unknown letter**.
   - The secret word pattern is: `[?] I T T Y`.

2. **Eliminated Letters** (from all feedback):
   - **A, B, C, D, E, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, R, S** (from `crane`: C,R,A,N,E; `spoil`: S,P,O,L; `might`: M,G,H; `ditty`: D; `bitty`: B).
   - **Available letters for Position 1**: F, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (Y is already used in position 5 but could theoretically be in position 1, though unlikely).

3. **Possible Valid Words**:
   - Common English words fitting `[?] I T T Y`:
     - **KITTY** (K in position 1): Valid (e.g., a young cat or a fund of money).
     - **WITTY** (W in position 1): Valid (clever/humorous).
     - Other combinations (e.g., F I T T Y, J I T T Y) are not standard English words.
   - **BITTY was eliminated** in Guess 5 (B is absent), leaving **KITTY** and **WITTY** as the only plausible options.

4. **Decision for Final Guess**:
   - We have **1 guess remaining** (this is the 6th attempt).
   - No prior feedback distinguishes between K and W (both untested).
   - **KITTY is chosen** because:
     - It uses **K** (a high-frequency consonant) and is a more common word than WITTY in everyday language.
     - If incorrect, WITTY would be the only remaining option, but since this is the final guess, we prioritize the statistically more likely candidate.

<guess>kitty</guess>",kitty,"We have the feedback for guess 5: ""bitty"" -> B(x) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)
This means:
- B is not in the word (x)
- I is correct at position 2 (✓)
- T is correct at position 3 (✓)
- T is correct at position 4 (✓) - note that the word has two T's, and both are correct at their positions.
- Y is correct at position 5 (✓)

So the secret word is of the form: _ I T T Y

We know position 2 is I, position 3 is T, position 4 is T, position 5 is Y. Only position 1 is unknown.

From the feedback, B is not the first letter (and not in the word at all).

Eliminated letters so far (from all guesses):
- From guess 1: C, R, A, N, E
- From guess 2: S, P, O, L
- From guess 3: M, G, H
- From guess 4: D
- From guess 5: B

So eliminated: A, B, C, D, E, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, R, S

Available letters for position 1: F, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: Y is already at position 5, so it can be at position 1? Yes, but the word would be YITTY, which is not a common word. Similarly, we need to form a valid English word.

Possible words ending with ITTY: 
- We had BITTY (but B is eliminated, so not)
- KITTY (K is available)
- WITTY (W is available)
- Other possibilities? 
  - FITTY: not a standard word (slang, but might not be in word list)
  - JITTY: not common (might be a variant of jetty, but jetty is 5 letters? j-e-t-t-y, not j-i-t-t-y)
  - KITTY and WITTY are the main ones.

Also, MITTY is not possible because M is eliminated.

So the only common words are KITTY and WITTY.

We have two options: K or W for the first letter.

We have one guess left (since we are on guess 6 now).

We must choose between KITTY and WITTY.

To decide, note that we haven't tested K or W in any previous guesses. We have no information about them.

But we can choose arbitrarily. Let's pick KITTY because it might be more common? Or WITTY.

We must be correct.

""PITTY"" is not a word; the correct spelling is ""pity"", which is 4 letters.

I think we should guess ""kitty"".

But let's see the previous feedback: in guess 3, we had ""might"" and T was marked wrong at position 5. Now, if the word is KITTY, it has no T at position 5, so that's consistent. Similarly for WITTY.

No additional clue.
