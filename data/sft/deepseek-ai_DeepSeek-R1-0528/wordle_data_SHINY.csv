We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in 5-letter English words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I recall that words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"" are often recommended.

 Let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). 
 This might help us get information about the vowels and some common consonants.

 So, my first guess is: RAISE

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""raise"" -> R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(-), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in ""raise"" I is the third letter).
 - S is in the word but in the wrong position. Since in ""raise"" it is the fourth letter, it cannot be at position 4 in the secret word.
 - R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
   The secret word has the letter 'I' in the third position.
   The secret word has the letter 'S', but not at position 4.
   The secret word does not contain R, A, or E.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 Constraints for next guess:
   Position 3 must be 'I'.
   Must include an 'S' but not at position 4.
   Must not include R, A, E.

 We have 6 tries total, and this is the second guess.

 Strategy:
   We need to form a valid 5-letter English word that satisfies:
     ? ? I ? ?
     Contains S, but S cannot be at position 4 (so positions 1,2,5 are possible for S).
     Does not have R, A, E.

   Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters we might try: among the most frequent consonants and vowels that we haven't tried. 
   We haven't used: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

 Since the word must have an 'S', we can think of words ending with S? But note, position 4 cannot be S, and position 5 is available.

 Possibilities: 
   We can have S at the beginning (position 1) or in the middle (position 2) or at the end (position 5).

 Let me think of words that have I in the third position and S somewhere else.

 Example words:
   If S is at position 1: S?I??
      Options: SWIFT? But W and F are not yet known. Also, A, E, R are eliminated and SWIFT has no A, E, R -> but we don't know about W and F. However, we have S at 1 and I at 3. But then what about position 4? We must avoid S at 4? But in SWIFT, S is at 1, then W, I, F, T. So position 4 is F. That's acceptable. But we don't know if W or F are in the word.

   We need a word that uses common unused letters to test more letters.

 Another idea: use a word that has S at position 5? For example: ??I?S

 But the word must be valid and should help us gather information about other letters.

 Since we have eliminated A, E, and R, we can try another vowel? The vowels left are O, U. But we can also focus on consonants.

 I think a good candidate could be ""SKILL"" but let's check: 
   S at position 1, then K, I, L, L. But we have I at position 3 -> so ""SKILL"" would be S K I L L -> positions: 1: S, 2: K, 3: I, 4: L, 5: L.
   However, we have S at position 1 which is allowed, and we don't have R,A,E.
   But in the feedback, we know S is in the word but not at position 4 (which is true here because S is at 1). Also, this word includes K, L, which are new.

 However, note that the word ""skill"" has double L? That might be inefficient because if L is not in the word, we lose two positions? Actually, we can get feedback on L twice, but that might not be optimal.

 Another candidate: ""SPOIL"" -> but note, O is a vowel and we haven't tested it? However, we cannot use O because we are avoiding E and A? Actually O might be present. But ""spoils"" has S at 1 and O at position 2 -> S P O I L? Wait, but position 3 must be I -> so we can't have O at position 3? Our word must have I at position 3. So the word must be _ _ I _ _.

 ""SPOIL"" has I at position 4? -> so no. We need I at position 3.

 We can try ""BUILT"" -> but that doesn't have S. We must include S? 

 Actually, from the feedback: we know the word has S (because S got a '-'), so we must include S in our next guess? Otherwise, we might not get full information.

 We must use a word that contains S and has I as the third letter.

 List of such words? 

 Possibilities:
   S at position 1: S _ I _ _
   S at position 2: _ S I _ _
   S at position 5: _ _ I _ S

 We don't know which, so we want a word that also tests other common letters.

 Consider ""BUILT"" doesn't have S -> invalid for requirement.

 For S at position 1: 
   SWIFT -> S W I F T
   SKIMP -> S K I M P
   SKILL -> S K I L L
   SMITE -> but E is not allowed? We know E is not in the word -> so words with E are invalid? Actually, our guess must not contain E because we know E is not in the secret word? 
   But note: the rules don't say we can't guess with letters we know are absent. However, if we guess a word with E, we know it will be marked as not present, which doesn't help us and wastes a chance to test a new letter. So we avoid E, R, A.

 Therefore, avoid E, R, A.

 Words without E, A, R: and having S and I at position 3.

 Option: S _ I _ _ without A,E,R.

 Try S?I??:

   Letters left: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

 Common: T, N, O, L, C, D, U

 For example: 
   STILT: S T I L T -> has T and L, but also I at 3 -> valid. And no E, A, R.
   But note: we have S at position 1 and L at position 4? But the feedback didn't say anything about position 4? So that's okay.

   However, in STILT: 
      We would test S (position1), T (position2), I (position3, known), L (position4), T (position5). 

   But we know S is in the word? Actually, we know S is in the word but not at position 4? So in the secret word, S might be at position 1? Or elsewhere? Our guess can choose to put S at position 1 to check if the secret word has S at 1? Or not.

   Alternatively, we could test S in a new position? 

 Let's think: 
   Since we know S must be in the word and not at position 4, we can try S at position 2? 
   For example: O S I T S? -> but that's not a word.

   How about ""POSIT"": P O S I T -> but that has I at position 4? Not position 3.

   We need exactly position 3 to be I.

   Another word: ""BASIS"" -> but B is present and we have A? We know A is not in the word? So avoid A.

   Let me try to think of words with S at position 5? like ??I?S: 
      Possible words: 
        TAWIS? -> not a valid common word.
        FOCUS? -> F O C U S -> position 3 is the letter C, not I.

   Actually, we need the third letter to be I: so ??I?S -> the last letter is S? 
      Example: 
        RADIS? -> has A and R -> invalid.
        LENIS? -> has E -> invalid.
        FIXIS? -> not common.

   It might be hard to find common words with S at the end and I in the middle? 

   Words with S at position 2? 
        _ S I _ _ 
        Example: OSIER -> has E and R -> invalid.
                  OSSIAN? Not common.

        USUAL? -> U S U A L -> but position 3 is U? So no.

        Possible: CHSIS? Not a word.

   Alternatively, what about ""MISDO"" -> M I S D O -> but that has I at position 2? Not 3.

   We need to focus on position 3 being I.

 Given the challenge, maybe S at position 1 is the most straightforward.

 So let's pick a word with S at position 1? 

   STILL: S T I L L -> but we get information about T (position2), L (position4 and 5). 
   But STILL has two L's -> redundant.

   Alternatively, STING: S T I N G -> N at position4, G at position5? 
   This word STING has common letters: T,N,G.

   Also, we don't know if any of T,N,G are in the word? It could be a good test.

   Another possibility: SLING: S L I N G -> tests L,N,G.

   But note that we already tried R,A,E and they are out. 

   We want to test letters that are frequent? 

   The word we choose should ideally maximize the number of new letters without repeating? 

   STING: letters S,T,I,N,G -> S is known to be in the word, I known? But we are testing S again? Actually, the feedback for S might change? 

   However, if the secret word does not have S at position 1, then we will get '-' if S is elsewhere? But we already know S is in the word? 

   In our guess, if we put S at position 1 and if the secret word also has S at position 1, we'll get ✓. Otherwise, if it's elsewhere, we get a '-'? But we already know S is not at position 4? So if we get a ✓ for S at position 1, that's good. If we get a '-' then we know S must be at position 2 or 5? 

   Also, we are testing two new letters: T, N, G?

   STING seems like a good candidate? But wait, in STING, position 4 is N and position 5 is G. We don't know if N or G are in the word? 

   Another candidate: SHINY? But Y is a less common letter? 

   Let me check STING: 
      S at 1 -> we are testing if S is at position 1? 
      T at 2 -> new letter
      I at 3 -> known to be correct? We hope to see a ✓? 
      N at 4 -> new letter
      G at 5 -> new letter

   This tests three new letters: T, N, G? And also the placement of S? 

   What about the vowel? Only I? But we have eliminated A,E. We haven't tested O, U? 

   But STING doesn't have O or U? 

   Alternatively, we might try ""SOUPY""? No, because we need I at 3 -> impossible? 

   Maybe we can try a word with S at a different position? 

   Alternatively, since we know S is not at position 4, and we are going to avoid position 4 for S? Then we can leave S out? Actually, we cannot because we must include S? Or we don't have to? 

   But note: the feedback tells us that S is in the word? So we know the secret word contains S. Therefore, using a word with S is essential? Otherwise, we don't check the placement? 

   We must include S in our guess? 

   Let me see: we must include S? because if we don't, we won't get information about where S is? 

   Yes, to learn about the position of S, we need to place it somewhere and see the feedback. 

   Therefore, our guess must contain S? 

   And we know the secret word has S? So yes, we include S.

   So STING: 
      Positions: 
        1: S -> we will get either ✓ or '-'? 
        2: T -> x, -, or ✓? 
        3: I -> ✓ (we know it's correct)
        4: N -> x, -, ✓
        5: G -> x, -, ✓

   This seems reasonable.

   Let's verify STING is a word? Yes, meaning: to feel a sharp pain.

   So I choose STING as my next guess.

   But wait: the feedback from the first guess told us that position 3 is I? So we want I at position 3? And STING does have I at position 3? 

   Also, it doesn't contain R,A,E.

   Therefore, I'll guess ""sting"".

<guess>sting</guess>
</think>
### Thought Process

Given the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- I is correct and in position (✓ at position 3)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

Key insights:
1. The secret word must have ""I"" as the third letter.
2. The secret word contains ""S"" but not in position 4.
3. The letters R, A, E are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word with ""I"" as the third letter.
- Must include ""S"" in a position other than 4 (so positions 1, 2, or 5).
- Must avoid R, A, E.
- Should test new frequent letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, C) to gather more information.

Considering words that fit these constraints:
- Option: ""sting"" (S at position 1, I at position 3). This tests:
  - S: position 1 (checking if S is correctly placed here).
  - T, N, G: new letters to probe for presence/position.
- Avoids R, A, E and redundant letters.
- Provides feedback on multiple new letters while leveraging known constraints.

Thus, ""sting"" is a strategic guess to maximize information about the secret word.

<guess>sting</guess>",sting,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""raise"" -> R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(-), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in ""raise"" I is the third letter).
 - S is in the word but in the wrong position. Since in ""raise"" it is the fourth letter, it cannot be at position 4 in the secret word.
 - R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
   The secret word has the letter 'I' in the third position.
   The secret word has the letter 'S', but not at position 4.

 Consider ""BUILT"" doesn't have S -> invalid for requirement.

 Therefore, avoid E, R, A.

 Words without E, A, R: and having S and I at position 3.

 Option: S _ I _ _ without A,E,R.

 Try S?I??:

   Letters left: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

 For example: 
   STILT: S T I L T -> has T and L, but also I at 3 -> valid. And no E, A, R.
   But note: we have S at position 1 and L at position 4? But the feedback didn't say anything about position 4? So that's okay.

        Example: OSIER -> has E and R -> invalid.
                  OSSIAN? Not common.

        USUAL? -> U S U A L -> but position 3 is U? So no.

        Possible: CHSIS? Not a word.

   Alternatively, what about ""MISDO"" -> M I S D O -> but that has I at position 2? Not 3.

   We need to focus on position 3 being I.

 Given the challenge, maybe S at position 1 is the most straightforward.

 So let's pick a word with S at position 1? 

   STILL: S T I L L -> but we get information about T (position2), L (position4 and 5). 
   But STILL has two L's -> redundant.

   Alternatively, STING: S T I N G -> N at position4, G at position5? 
   This word STING has common letters: T,N,G.

   Also, we don't know if any of T,N,G are in the word? It could be a good test.

   Another possibility: SLING: S L I N G -> tests L,N,G.

   But note that we already tried R,A,E and they are out. 

   We want to test letters that are frequent? 

   The word we choose should ideally maximize the number of new letters without repeating? 

   STING: letters S,T,I,N,G -> S is known to be in the word, I known? But we are testing S again? Actually, the feedback for S might change? 

   However, if the secret word does not have S at position 1, then we will get '-' if S is elsewhere? But we already know S is in the word? 

   In our guess, if we put S at position 1 and if the secret word also has S at position 1, we'll get ✓. Otherwise, if it's elsewhere, we get a '-'? But we already know S is not at position 4? So if we get a ✓ for S at position 1, that's good. If we get a '-' then we know S must be at position 2 or 5? 

   Also, we are testing two new letters: T, N, G?

   STING seems like a good candidate? But wait, in STING, position 4 is N and position 5 is G. We don't know if N or G are in the word? 

   Another candidate: SHINY? But Y is a less common letter? 

   Let me check STING: 
      S at 1 -> we are testing if S is at position 1? 
      T at 2 -> new letter
      I at 3 -> known to be correct? We hope to see a ✓? 
      N at 4 -> new letter
      G at 5 -> new letter

   This tests three new letters: T, N, G? And also the placement of S? 

   What about the vowel? Only I? But we have eliminated A,E. We haven't tested O, U? 

   But STING doesn't have O or U? 

   Alternatively, we might try ""SOUPY""? No, because we need I at 3 -> impossible? 

   Maybe we can try a word with S at a different position? 

   Alternatively, since we know S is not at position 4, and we are going to avoid position 4 for S? Then we can leave S out? Actually, we cannot because we must include S? Or we don't have to? 

   But note: the feedback tells us that S is in the word? So we know the secret word contains S. Therefore, using a word with S is essential? Otherwise, we don't check the placement? 

   We must include S in our guess? 

   Let me see: we must include S? because if we don't, we won't get information about where S is? 

   Yes, to learn about the position of S, we need to place it somewhere and see the feedback. 

   Therefore, our guess must contain S? 

   And we know the secret word has S? So yes, we include S.

   So STING: 
      Positions: 
        1: S -> we will get either ✓ or '-'? 
        2: T -> x, -, or ✓? 
        3: I -> ✓ (we know it's correct)
        4: N -> x, -, ✓
        5: G -> x, -, ✓

   This seems reasonable.

   Let's verify STING is a word? Yes, meaning: to feel a sharp pain.

   So I choose STING as my next guess.

   But wait: the feedback from the first guess told us that position 3 is I? So we want I at position 3? And STING does have I at position 3? 

   Also, it doesn't contain R,A,E.

   Therefore, I'll guess ""sting"".

<guess>sting</guess>### Thought Process

Given the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is not in the word (x)
- I is correct and in position (✓ at position 3)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

Key insights:
1. The secret word must have ""I"" as the third letter.
2. The secret word contains ""S"" but not in position 4.
3. The letters R, A, E are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word with ""I"" as the third letter.
- Must include ""S"" in a position other than 4 (so positions 1, 2, or 5).
- Must avoid R, A, E.
- Should test new frequent letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, C) to gather more information.

Considering words that fit these constraints:
- Option: ""sting"" (S at position 1, I at position 3). This tests:
  - S: position 1 (checking if S is correctly placed here).
  - T, N, G: new letters to probe for presence/position.
- Avoids R, A, E and redundant letters.
- Provides feedback on multiple new letters while leveraging known constraints.

Thus, ""sting"" is a strategic guess to maximize information about the secret word.",Guess 2: sting -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,SHINY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in 5-letter English words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I recall that words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"" are often recommended.

 Let's choose ""RAISE"" because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). 
 This might help us get information about the vowels and some common consonants.

 So, my first guess is: RAISE

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""raise"" -> R(x), A(x), I(✓), S(-), E(x)

 Interpretation:
 - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since in ""raise"" I is the third letter).
 - S is in the word but in the wrong position. Since in ""raise"" it is the fourth letter, it cannot be at position 4 in the secret word.
 - R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, we know:
   The secret word has the letter 'I' in the third position.
   The secret word has the letter 'S', but not at position 4.
   The secret word does not contain R, A, or E.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

 Constraints for next guess:
   Position 3 must be 'I'.
   Must include an 'S' but not at position 4.
   Must not include R, A, E.

 We have 6 tries total, and this is the second guess.

 Strategy:
   We need to form a valid 5-letter English word that satisfies:
     ? ? I ? ?
     Contains S, but S cannot be at position 4 (so positions 1,2,5 are possible for S).
     Does not have R, A, E.

   Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters we might try: among the most frequent consonants and vowels that we haven't tried. 
   We haven't used: T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.

 Since the word must have an 'S', we can think of words ending with S? But note, position 4 cannot be S, and position 5 is available.

 Possibilities: 
   We can have S at the beginning (position 1) or in the middle (position 2) or at the end (position 5).

 Let me think of words that have I in the third position and S somewhere else.

 Example words:
   If S is at position 1: S?I??
      Options: SWIFT? But W and F are not yet known. Also, A, E, R are eliminated and SWIFT has no A, E, R -> but we don't know about W and F. However, we have S at 1 and I at 3. But then what about position 4? We must avoid S at 4? But in SWIFT, S is at 1, then W, I, F, T. So position 4 is F. That's acceptable. But we don't know if W or F are in the word.

   We need a word that uses common unused letters to test more letters.

 Another idea: use a word that has S at position 5? For example: ??I?S

 But the word must be valid and should help us gather information about other letters.

 Since we have eliminated A, E, and R, we can try another vowel? The vowels left are O, U. But we can also focus on consonants.

 I think a good candidate could be ""SKILL"" but let's check: 
   S at position 1, then K, I, L, L. But we have I at position 3 -> so ""SKILL"" would be S K I L L -> positions: 1: S, 2: K, 3: I, 4: L, 5: L.
   However, we have S at position 1 which is allowed, and we don't have R,A,E.
   But in the feedback, we know S is in the word but not at position 4 (which is true here because S is at 1). Also, this word includes K, L, which are new.

 However, note that the word ""skill"" has double L? That might be inefficient because if L is not in the word, we lose two positions? Actually, we can get feedback on L twice, but that might not be optimal.

 Another candidate: ""SPOIL"" -> but note, O is a vowel and we haven't tested it? However, we cannot use O because we are avoiding E and A? Actually O might be present. But ""spoils"" has S at 1 and O at position 2 -> S P O I L? Wait, but position 3 must be I -> so we can't have O at position 3? Our word must have I at position 3. So the word must be _ _ I _ _.

 ""SPOIL"" has I at position 4? -> so no. We need I at position 3.

 We can try ""BUILT"" -> but that doesn't have S. We must include S? 

 Actually, from the feedback: we know the word has S (because S got a '-'), so we must include S in our next guess? Otherwise, we might not get full information.

 We must use a word that contains S and has I as the third letter.

 List of such words? 

 Possibilities:
   S at position 1: S _ I _ _
   S at position 2: _ S I _ _
   S at position 5: _ _ I _ S

 We don't know which, so we want a word that also tests other common letters.

 Consider ""BUILT"" doesn't have S -> invalid for requirement.

 For S at position 1: 
   SWIFT -> S W I F T
   SKIMP -> S K I M P
   SKILL -> S K I L L
   SMITE -> but E is not allowed? We know E is not in the word -> so words with E are invalid? Actually, our guess must not contain E because we know E is not in the secret word? 
   But note: the rules don't say we can't guess with letters we know are absent. However, if we guess a word with E, we know it will be marked as not present, which doesn't help us and wastes a chance to test a new letter. So we avoid E, R, A.

 Therefore, avoid E, R, A.

 Words without E, A, R: and having S and I at position 3.

 Option: S _ I _ _ without A,E,R.

 Try S?I??:

   Letters left: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

 Common: T, N, O, L, C, D, U

 For example: 
   STILT: S T I L T -> has T and L, but also I at 3 -> valid. And no E, A, R.
   But note: we have S at position 1 and L at position 4? But the feedback didn't say anything about position 4? So that's okay.

   However, in STILT: 
      We would test S (position1), T (position2), I (position3, known), L (position4), T (position5). 

   But we know S is in the word? Actually, we know S is in the word but not at position 4? So in the secret word, S might be at position 1? Or elsewhere? Our guess can choose to put S at position 1 to check if the secret word has S at 1? Or not.

   Alternatively, we could test S in a new position? 

 Let's think: 
   Since we know S must be in the word and not at position 4, we can try S at position 2? 
   For example: O S I T S? -> but that's not a word.

   How about ""POSIT"": P O S I T -> but that has I at position 4? Not position 3.

   We need exactly position 3 to be I.

   Another word: ""BASIS"" -> but B is present and we have A? We know A is not in the word? So avoid A.

   Let me try to think of words with S at position 5? like ??I?S: 
      Possible words: 
        TAWIS? -> not a valid common word.
        FOCUS? -> F O C U S -> position 3 is the letter C, not I.

   Actually, we need the third letter to be I: so ??I?S -> the last letter is S? 
      Example: 
        RADIS? -> has A and R -> invalid.
        LENIS? -> has E -> invalid.
        FIXIS? -> not common.

   It might be hard to find common words with S at the end and I in the middle? 

   Words with S at position 2? 
        _ S I _ _ 
        Example: OSIER -> has E and R -> invalid.
                  OSSIAN? Not common.

        USUAL? -> U S U A L -> but position 3 is U? So no.

        Possible: CHSIS? Not a word.

   Alternatively, what about ""MISDO"" -> M I S D O -> but that has I at position 2? Not 3.

   We need to focus on position 3 being I.

 Given the challenge, maybe S at position 1 is the most straightforward.

 So let's pick a word with S at position 1? 

   STILL: S T I L L -> but we get information about T (position2), L (position4 and 5). 
   But STILL has two L's -> redundant.

   Alternatively, STING: S T I N G -> N at position4, G at position5? 
   This word STING has common letters: T,N,G.

   Also, we don't know if any of T,N,G are in the word? It could be a good test.

   Another possibility: SLING: S L I N G -> tests L,N,G.

   But note that we already tried R,A,E and they are out. 

   We want to test letters that are frequent? 

   The word we choose should ideally maximize the number of new letters without repeating? 

   STING: letters S,T,I,N,G -> S is known to be in the word, I known? But we are testing S again? Actually, the feedback for S might change? 

   However, if the secret word does not have S at position 1, then we will get '-' if S is elsewhere? But we already know S is in the word? 

   In our guess, if we put S at position 1 and if the secret word also has S at position 1, we'll get ✓. Otherwise, if it's elsewhere, we get a '-'? But we already know S is not at position 4? So if we get a ✓ for S at position 1, that's good. If we get a '-' then we know S must be at position 2 or 5? 

   Also, we are testing two new letters: T, N, G?

   STING seems like a good candidate? But wait, in STING, position 4 is N and position 5 is G. We don't know if N or G are in the word? 

   Another candidate: SHINY? But Y is a less common letter? 

   Let me check STING: 
      S at 1 -> we are testing if S is at position 1? 
      T at 2 -> new letter
      I at 3 -> known to be correct? We hope to see a ✓? 
      N at 4 -> new letter
      G at 5 -> new letter

   This tests three new letters: T, N, G? And also the placement of S? 

   What about the vowel? Only I? But we have eliminated A,E. We haven't tested O, U? 

   But STING doesn't have O or U? 

   Alternatively, we might try ""SOUPY""? No, because we need I at 3 -> impossible? 

   Maybe we can try a word with S at a different position? 

   Alternatively, since we know S is not at position 4, and we are going to avoid position 4 for S? Then we can leave S out? Actually, we cannot because we must include S? Or we don't have to? 

   But note: the feedback tells us that S is in the word? So we know the secret word contains S. Therefore, using a word with S is essential? Otherwise, we don't check the placement? 

   We must include S in our guess? 

   Let me see: we must include S? because if we don't, we won't get information about where S is? 

   Yes, to learn about the position of S, we need to place it somewhere and see the feedback. 

   Therefore, our guess must contain S? 

   And we know the secret word has S? So yes, we include S.

   So STING: 
      Positions: 
        1: S -> we will get either ✓ or '-'? 
        2: T -> x, -, or ✓? 
        3: I -> ✓ (we know it's correct)
        4: N -> x, -, ✓
        5: G -> x, -, ✓

   This seems reasonable.

   Let's verify STING is a word? Yes, meaning: to feel a sharp pain.

   So I choose STING as my next guess.

   But wait: the feedback from the first guess told us that position 3 is I? So we want I at position 3? And STING does have I at position 3? 

   Also, it doesn't contain R,A,E.

   Therefore, I'll guess ""sting"".

- A is not in the word (x)
- I is correct and in position (✓ at position 3)

Key insights:

3. The letters R, A, E are not in the word.

Actually, our guess must not contain E because we know E is not in the secret word? \n   But note: the rules don\'t say we can\'t guess with letters we know are absent. However, if we guess a word with E, we know it will be marked as not present, which doesn\'t help us and wastes a chance to test a new letter. So we avoid E, R, A.\n\n Therefore, avoid E, R, A.\n\n Words without E, A, R: and having S and I at position 3.\n\n Option: S _ I _ _ without A,E,R.\n\n Try S?I??:\n\n   Letters left: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\n Common: T, N, O, L, C, D, U\n\n For example: \n   STILT: S T I L T -> has T and L, but also I at 3 -> valid. And no E, A, R.\n   But note: we have S at position 1 and L at position 4? But the feedback didn\'t say anything about position 4? So that\'s okay.\n\n   However, in STILT: \n      We would test S (position1), T (position2), I (position3, known), L (position4), T (position5). \n\n   But we know S is in the word? Actually, we know S is in the word but not at position 4? So in the secret word, S might be at position 1? Or elsewhere? Our guess can choose to put S at position 1 to check if the secret word has S at 1? Or not.\n\n   Alternatively, we could test S in a new position? \n\n Let\'s think: \n   Since we know S must be in the word and not at position 4, we can try S at position 2? \n   For example: O S I T S? -> but that\'s not a word.\n\n   How about ""POSIT"": P O S I T -> but that has I at position 4? Not position 3.\n\n   We need exactly position 3 to be I.\n\n   Another word: ""BASIS"" -> but B is present and we have A? We know A is not in the word? So avoid A.\n\n   Let me try to think of words with S at position 5? like ??I?S: \n      Possible words: \n        TAWIS? -> not a valid common word.\n        FOCUS? -> F O C U S -> position 3 is the letter C, not I.\n\n   Actually, we need the third letter to be I: so ??I?S -> the last letter is S? \n      Example: \n        RADIS? -> has A and R -> invalid.\n        LENIS? -> has E -> invalid.\n        FIXIS? -> not common.\n\n   It might be hard to find common words with S at the end and I in the middle? \n\n   Words with S at position 2? \n        _ S I _ _ \n        Example: OSIER -> has E and R -> invalid.\n                  OSSIAN? Not common.\n\n        USUAL? -> U S U A L -> but position 3 is U? So no.\n\n        Possible: CHSIS? Not a word.\n\n   Alternatively, what about ""MISDO"" -> M I S D O -> but that has I at position 2? Not 3.\n\n   We need to focus on position 3 being I.\n\n Given the challenge, maybe S at position 1 is the most straightforward.\n\n So let\'s pick a word with S at position 1? \n\n   STILL: S T I L L -> but we get information about T (position2), L (position4 and 5). \n   But STILL has two L\'s -> redundant.\n\n   Alternatively, STING: S T I N G -> N at position4, G at position5? \n   This word STING has common letters: T,N,G.\n\n   Also, we don\'t know if any of T,N,G are in the word? It could be a good test.\n\n   Another possibility: SLING: S L I N G -> tests L,N,G.\n\n   But note that we already tried R,A,E and they are out. \n\n   We want to test letters that are frequent? \n\n   The word we choose should ideally maximize the number of new letters without repeating? \n\n   STING: letters S,T,I,N,G -> S is known to be in the word, I known? But we are testing S again? Actually, the feedback for S might change? \n\n   However, if the secret word does not have S at position 1, then we will get \'-\' if S is elsewhere? But we already know S is in the word? \n\n   In our guess, if we put S at position 1 and if the secret word also has S at position 1, we\'ll get ✓. Otherwise, if it\'s elsewhere, we get a \'-\'? But we already know S is not at position 4? So if we get a ✓ for S at position 1, that\'s good. If we get a \'-\' then we know S must be at position 2 or 5? \n\n   Also, we are testing two new letters: T, N, G?\n\n   STING seems like a good candidate? But wait, in STING, position 4 is N and position 5 is G. We don\'t know if N or G are in the word? \n\n   Another candidate: SHINY? But Y is a less common letter? \n\n   Let me check STING: \n      S at 1 -> we are testing if S is at position 1? \n      T at 2 -> new letter\n      I at 3 -> known to be correct? We hope to see a ✓? \n      N at 4 -> new letter\n      G at 5 -> new letter\n\n   This tests three new letters: T, N, G? And also the placement of S? \n\n   What about the vowel? Only I? But we have eliminated A,E. We haven\'t tested O, U? \n\n   But STING doesn\'t have O or U? \n\n   Alternatively, we might try ""SOUPY""? No, because we need I at 3 -> impossible? \n\n   Maybe we can try a word with S at a different position? \n\n   Alternatively, since we know S is not at position 4, and we are going to avoid position 4 for S? Then we can leave S out? Actually, we cannot because we must include S? Or we don\'t have to? \n\n   But note: the feedback tells us that S is in the word? So we know the secret word contains S. Therefore, using a word with S is essential? Otherwise, we don\'t check the placement? \n\n   We must include S in our guess? \n\n   Let me see: we must include S? because if we don\'t, we won\'t get information about where S is? \n\n   Yes, to learn about the position of S, we need to place it somewhere and see the feedback. \n\n   Therefore, our guess must contain S? \n\n   And we know the secret word has S? So yes, we include S.\n\n   So STING: \n      Positions: \n        1: S -> we will get either ✓ or \'-\'? \n        2: T -> x, -, or ✓? \n        3: I -> ✓ (we know it\'s correct)\n        4: N -> x, -, ✓\n        5: G -> x, -, ✓\n\n   This seems reasonable.\n\n   Let\'s verify STING is a word? Yes, meaning: to feel a sharp pain.\n\n   So I choose STING as my next guess.\n\n   But wait: the feedback from the first guess told us that position 3 is I? So we want I at position 3? And STING does have I at position 3? \n\n   Also, it doesn\'t contain R,A,E.\n\n   Therefore, I\'ll guess ""sting"".\n\n<guess>sting</guess>### Thought Process\n\nGiven the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R is not in the word (x)\n- A is not in the word (x)\n- I is correct and in position (✓ at position 3)\n- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)\n- E is not in the word (x)\n\nKey insights:\n1. The secret word must have ""I"" as the third letter.\n2. The secret word contains ""S"" but not in position 4.\n3. The letters R, A, E are not in the word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must be a 5-letter word with ""I"" as the third letter.\n- Must include ""S"" in a position other than 4 (so positions 1, 2, or 5).\n- Must avoid R, A, E.\n- Should test new frequent letters (e.g., T, N, O, L, C) to gather more information.\n\nConsidering words that fit these constraints:\n- Option: ""sting"" (S at position 1, I at position 3). This tests:\n  - S: position 1 (checking if S is correctly placed here).\n  - T, N, G: new letters to probe for presence/position.\n- Avoids R, A, E and redundant letters.\n- Provides feedback on multiple new letters while leveraging known constraints.\n\nThus, ""sting"" is a strategic guess to maximize information about the secret word.\n\n<guess>sting</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(✓) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: sting -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  I: ✓ (correct position, so position 3 is I)
  S: - (in word, wrong position; and specifically not at position 4)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""sting""
  S: ✓ (so S is in the word and at position 1! Because we placed it at position 1 and got a check)
  T: x (not in the word)
  I: ✓ (correct, as we know)
  N: ✓ (so N is in the word and at position 4? Because we placed it at position 4 and got a check)
  G: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has S at position 1 and I at position 3 and N at position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: R, A, E, T, G.
- The secret word has the letters: S, I, N (and we know their positions: S at 1, I at 3, N at 4).

The secret word pattern is: S _ I N _ 

We are missing the second and fifth letters.

We also know the word must be 5 letters and not contain R, A, E, T, G.

We have 4 tries left.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: S ? I N ? 

We must avoid the letters: R, A, E, T, G.

We can use the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to choose common letters to maximize the chance of hitting the word or getting information.

We have two positions to guess: position 2 and position 5.

We can try to form a word that uses common letters for these positions.

Common letters for the second position: we might try a vowel? The vowels we haven't tried are O, U. Or a consonant? Common consonants left: L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Similarly, for the fifth position: common letters could be a consonant or vowel.

But note: we have only two positions to fill, and we can try to guess the entire word.

Possible words that fit the pattern S?IN? and avoid R,A,E,T,G:

Let's list some:

- ""SPINY"": S P I N Y -> P at 2, Y at 5. But Y is at the end? And we don't know if Y is in the word? Also, check letters: P and Y are not forbidden? But we haven't tried them. However, ""spiny"" is a word? Yes, meaning having spines.

- ""SHINS"": S H I N S -> H at 2, S at 5. But we already know S is at position 1? And we have S at 5? But the secret word might have two S's? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates? However, in the first guess, we had only one S and it was marked as present but not at 4. Now we have S at 1 and if we put S at 5, that's possible? But note: in the first guess, we had S at position 4? But that was marked as not at 4? It didn't say anything about other positions? So if the word has two S's, then in the first guess, the S at position 4 would be marked as present (but wrong position) even if there is another S? 

But in our second guess, we have S at position 1 and it was marked as correct? So the secret word has at least one S at position 1. Now, if we put S at position 5, and if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 5 would be marked as absent? Or if it has two S's, then it might be marked as present? 

But we don't know? However, we are trying to guess the word? We can try ""shins"", but let's see the pattern: S H I N S -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:S. 

But we know the secret word has S at 1 and N at 4? So if we guess ""shins"", we are testing H at 2 and S at 5? 

But we have only two positions to fill? We can try to guess the entire word? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests new letters? 

But note: we have two unknowns? We can try to use a word that has common letters for position 2 and 5? 

Another word: ""SKINS"": S K I N S -> K at 2, S at 5? But we don't know about K? 

""SPINS"": S P I N S -> P at 2, S at 5? 

But we don't know if the secret word has two S's? 

We can avoid the double S? 

Another word: ""SHINE"": but E is not allowed? We know E is not in the word? So avoid E.

""SHINY"": S H I N Y -> H at 2, Y at 5? 

""SPINE"": has E -> invalid.

""SWINE"": has E -> invalid.

""SOUND"": doesn't have I at 3? 

We need I at 3 and N at 4? 

So the pattern is fixed: S ? I N ? 

We can try:

- ""SHINY"": S H I N Y -> H and Y are new? 
- ""SPINY"": S P I N Y -> P and Y? 
- ""SKINT"": but T is not allowed? T is eliminated? 
- ""SCION"": S C I O N -> but then position 4 is O? But we need position 4 to be N? So no? 

Wait, we know position 4 is N? So the word must end with ""IN"" at positions 3 and 4? 

So the pattern is: S [letter] I N [letter]

We can list possible words:

- ""SHINS"" (if we allow double S? but we don't know if the fifth letter is S? and we have S at 1 already? so if the word has two S's, then the fifth could be S? but we don't know? and we are avoiding R,A,E,T,G? so S is allowed? but we already know S is in the word? so it's okay? but we are testing if there is an S at the end? 

But we have limited guesses? We can try to avoid double letters? 

Another word: ""SHINE"" -> invalid because of E.

""SHINY"": S H I N Y -> valid? 

""SPINY"": S P I N Y -> valid? 

""SWING"": but G is not allowed? G is eliminated? 

""SMITH"": has T? T is eliminated? 

""SLING"": has G? eliminated? 

""STING"": we already tried? 

So the options are limited? 

We can try ""shiny"" or ""spiny""? 

But we have two positions? We can also try ""scion""? but that doesn't have N at position 4? 

Wait, ""scion"" is S C I O N -> positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:I, 4:O, 5:N -> but we need position 4 to be N? So that doesn't match? 

We know position 4 is N? So the word must be S ? I N ? 

So the fifth letter is the last letter? 

Another word: ""OPINE"" -> doesn't start with S? 

We must start with S? 

So let's think of words: 

- ""shins"": S H I N S -> but we have S at 1 and S at 5? 
- ""skins"": S K I N S -> same? 
- ""spins"": S P I N S -> same? 

But also: 

- ""shiny"": S H I N Y
- ""spiny"": S P I N Y
- ""swine"": invalid because of E? 
- ""saint"": has A? invalid? 
- ""slyly"": doesn't have I at 3? 

What about ""sabin""? Not a common word? 

""SAVIN"": S A V I N -> but A is invalid? 

We need to avoid A? 

So the common words are: ""shins"", ""skins"", ""spins"", ""shiny"", ""spiny"", ""swing"" (but G is invalid), etc.

But we know G is not in the word? So ""swing"" is invalid? 

So we have:

- ""shins"": S H I N S
- ""skins"": S K I N S
- ""spins"": S P I N S
- ""shiny"": S H I N Y
- ""spiny"": S P I N Y

We also have ""sains""? Not common? 

""SOUND"": doesn't fit pattern? 

We can try to use a word that has a vowel in position 2? Like O or U? 

For example: ""SOUND"" -> no? 

""SOULS"": doesn't have I at 3? 

We need I at 3? 

""SOLID"": S O L I D -> but then position 3 is L? not I? 

We need position 3 to be I? 

So the pattern is fixed: S [consonant?] I N [consonant or vowel?]

But we can try ""suing""? S U I N G -> but G is invalid? 

""SUINT"": S U I N T -> but T is invalid? 

So we are left with the list above? 

Now, we have to choose one? 

We can try ""shiny"" because it tests two new letters: H and Y? 

But note: we don't have to use a word that has the known letters? We already know S, I, N? So we can use a word that has S at 1, I at 3, N at 4? and then two new letters? 

But we are trying to guess the word? 

Alternatively, we can try to get more information? But we have only two positions? We can try to guess the entire word? 

But we have 4 tries? So we can try one of these? 

But we don't know which? 

We can try ""shiny"" and if it's not correct, we get feedback on H and Y? 

But if we try ""shins"", we are testing if the fifth letter is S? 

But we already know S is at position 1? So if the fifth letter is S, then we get a ✓ for the last S? 

But if it's not, then we get an x? 

Similarly, for ""shiny"", we test Y? 

But we don't have much information? 

We can also consider that the secret word might be ""shins"" or ""skins"" or ""spins"" or ""shiny"" or ""spiny""? 

But we can try to use a word that has letters that are common? 

Another idea: we can try a word that doesn't have S at the end? to avoid the double S? 

For example, ""shiny"" or ""spiny""? 

But we don't know? 

We can try ""spiny"": 

  If we guess ""spiny"": 
    S: ✓ (position 1)
    P: ? (position 2: if the secret word has P at position 2, then ✓; if not, then x or -? but we don't know if P is in the word? 
    I: ✓ (position 3)
    N: ✓ (position 4)
    Y: ? (position 5: if the secret word has Y at position 5, then ✓; else x or -? but if it's not at 5, but elsewhere? but we have only 5 positions? and we know the first four? so if Y is in the word, it must be at position 5? because the other positions are fixed? 

Actually, the secret word is S ? I N ? 

So the only unknown positions are 2 and 5? 

Therefore, if we guess ""spiny"", then:

  Position 2: P -> if the secret word has P at position 2, then ✓; if not, then if P is in the word at all? but the only other position is 5? but we are putting Y at 5? so if the secret word has P at position 5? then we would get a '-' for P? but we are putting P at position 2? 

But the secret word has fixed positions: 1:S, 3:I, 4:N? and positions 2 and 5 are unknown? 

So if we guess ""spiny"", then:

  Position 1: S -> ✓
  Position 2: P -> if the secret word has P at position 2, then ✓; if the secret word has P at position 5, then we get a '-' for P? because it's in the word but not at position 2? and if the secret word doesn't have P at all, then x? 
  Position 3: I -> ✓
  Position 4: N -> ✓
  Position 5: Y -> similarly, if the secret word has Y at position 5, then ✓; if it has Y at position 2, then we get a '-' for Y? but we are putting Y at 5? 

But the secret word has only two unknown positions? So the letter at position 2 and 5? 

Therefore, the feedback for position 2 and 5 will be:

  For the letter at position 2 in the guess (P): 
    - If the secret word has P at position 2: ✓
    - If the secret word has P at position 5: then P is in the word but not at position 2 -> so '-' 
    - If the secret word doesn't have P at all: x

  Similarly for Y at position 5:
    - If the secret word has Y at position 5: ✓
    - If the secret word has Y at position 2: then Y is in the word but not at position 5 -> so '-' 
    - If the secret word doesn't have Y: x

But note: the secret word has exactly two letters: one at position 2 and one at position 5? 

So the possibilities for the secret word are:

  The letter at position 2: one of the allowed letters? 
  The letter at position 5: one of the allowed letters? 

And they are distinct? Or can be the same? 

They can be the same? For example, ""shins"" has S at 1 and S at 5? 

So if we guess ""spiny"", we might get:

  Case 1: the secret word is ""spiny"": then we get all ✓? 
  Case 2: the secret word has P at position 2 and a different letter at 5? then we get P✓ and Y? 
  Case 3: the secret word has a different letter at 2 and Y at 5? then we get for P: x or -? and for Y: ✓? 
  Case 4: the secret word has P at position 5? then we get for P: '-' (because we put it at 2 but it's at 5) and for Y: if the secret word has the letter at position 2? then we put Y at 5? so if the secret word has Y at position 2? then we get for Y: '-'? because it's at position 2 but we put it at 5? 

This might be confusing? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has two new letters that are common? 

But we have to choose one? 

We can try ""shiny"" to test H and Y? 

But we don't know? 

We can also consider the frequency of letters? 

Common letters for position 2: H, P, K, L, etc.

Common letters for position 5: S, Y, D, etc. but D is not tested? 

But we know the word must be a valid English word? 

We can try ""shiny"" because it is a common word? 

But let's see: if we guess ""shiny"", and if the secret word is ""shins"", then we get:

  S: ✓
  H: ✓ (if H is at position 2? then ✓? but if the secret word is ""shins"", then H is at position 2? so ✓? 
  I: ✓
  N: ✓
  Y: ? -> but the secret word has S at position 5? so we put Y at 5? but the secret word has S at 5? so Y is not in the word? so we get x for Y? 

So feedback: S(✓) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) Y(x)

Then we know the secret word is S H I N ? and the last letter is not Y? and we know it must be one of the letters we haven't eliminated? and we know it must be a letter that forms a word? 

But we also know that the secret word has S? and we have S at position 1? so the last letter could be S? 

Then we can guess ""shins"" next? 

Similarly, if we guess ""spiny"" and the secret word is ""spins"", then:

  S: ✓
  P: ✓ (if ""spins"" has P at position 2? then ✓? 
  I: ✓
  N: ✓
  Y: x (because ""spins"" has S at 5? not Y? 

Then we know the last letter is not Y? and we can guess ""spins"" next? 

But we have 4 tries? So we can afford to do that? 

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that has a letter that covers multiple possibilities? 

But it's difficult? 

We can also try ""sains""? but not common? 

Another word: ""scind""? not common? 

I think ""shiny"" is a good guess? 

But let me check the frequency? 

We can try ""shins"" directly? 

But if we guess ""shins"" and it's not the word, then we get feedback? 

For example, if we guess ""shins"":

  S at 1: ✓ (we know)
  H at 2: ? 
  I at 3: ✓
  N at 4: ✓
  S at 5: ? 

The feedback for H: 
  If the secret word has H at position 2, then ✓? 
  If the secret word has H at position 5? then we get '-' for H? but we put H at 2? 
  But the secret word has position 2 and 5? 

But if the secret word is ""skins"", then:

  S at 1: ✓
  H at 2: x (because ""skins"" has K at 2? so H is not in the word? 
  I: ✓
  N: ✓
  S at 5: ✓ (because ""skins"" has S at 5? 

So feedback: S(✓) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) S(✓)

Then we know the secret word is S ? I N S, and H is not in the word? 

Then we can guess ""skins"" or ""spins""? 

Similarly, if we guess ""shins"" and the secret word is ""shiny"", then:

  S: ✓
  H: ✓
  I: ✓
  N: ✓
  S: x (because the secret word has Y at 5? not S? 

So feedback: S(✓) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) S(x)

Then we know the last letter is not S? and we can guess ""shiny"" next? 

But we have only two positions? and we are testing one word? 

But we have 4 tries? So we can do that? 

But we want to be efficient? 

We can try to use a word that doesn't reuse S? to avoid the double letter? 

For example, ""shiny"" or ""spiny""? 

I think ""shiny"" is a good guess? 

Let me choose ""shiny"" as the next guess? 

So <guess>shiny</guess> 

But we are not sure? 

Another idea: we can try a word that has a vowel in position 2? to cover the possibility of a vowel? 

For example, ""suing"" is invalid? 

""sound"" doesn't fit? 

""sozin""? not a word? 

I think ""shiny"" is acceptable? 

So I'll go with ""shiny"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""raise""** → R(absent), A(absent), I(correct position), S(present but wrong position), E(absent).  
  This reveals:  
  - I is in the secret word at position 3.  
  - S is in the secret word but not at position 4.  
  - R, A, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""sting""** → S(correct position), T(absent), I(correct position), N(correct position), G(absent).  
  This reveals:  
  - S is at position 1.  
  - N is at position 4.  
  - T and G are not in the word.

- **Secret word pattern**: `S _ I N _` (positions: 1=S, 3=I, 4=N).  
- **Known absent letters**: R, A, E, T, G.  
- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 5.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Position 2 and 5 must be filled with letters not in {R, A, E, T, G}.  
  - The word must include S (already placed at position 1) and cannot have S at position 4 (from first guess).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to guess a valid 5-letter word fitting `S _ I N _`.  
- Focus on testing common letters for positions 2 and 5 (e.g., H, Y, P, L, O, U) to maximize information.  
- Avoid absent letters (R, A, E, T, G).  
- ""shiny"" is a strong candidate:  
  - Fits the pattern: S (position 1), H (tests position 2), I (position 3), N (position 4), Y (tests position 5).  
  - Tests two new common letters (H and Y).  
  - If incorrect, feedback on H and Y will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if H is correct, absent, or misplaced; same for Y).  

### Why ""shiny""?
- If correct, we solve the word.  
- If not, feedback will reveal:  
  - Whether H is in position 2 (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x).  
  - Whether Y is in position 5 (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x).  
- This will leave only a few possibilities for the next guess (e.g., ""shins"", ""skins"", ""spins"", or ""spiny"").  

<guess>shiny</guess>",shiny,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  I: ✓ (correct position, so position 3 is I)
  S: - (in word, wrong position; and specifically not at position 4)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""sting""
  S: ✓ (so S is in the word and at position 1! Because we placed it at position 1 and got a check)
  T: x (not in the word)
  I: ✓ (correct, as we know)
  N: ✓ (so N is in the word and at position 4? Because we placed it at position 4 and got a check)
  G: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has S at position 1 and I at position 3 and N at position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: R, A, E, T, G.
- The secret word has the letters: S, I, N (and we know their positions: S at 1, I at 3, N at 4).

The secret word pattern is: S _ I N _ 

We are missing the second and fifth letters.

We also know the word must be 5 letters and not contain R, A, E, T, G.

We have 4 tries left.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: S ? I N ? 

We must avoid the letters: R, A, E, T, G.

We can use the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to choose common letters to maximize the chance of hitting the word or getting information.

We have two positions to guess: position 2 and position 5.

We can try to form a word that uses common letters for these positions.

Common letters for the second position: we might try a vowel? The vowels we haven't tried are O, U. Or a consonant? Common consonants left: L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Similarly, for the fifth position: common letters could be a consonant or vowel.

But note: we have only two positions to fill, and we can try to guess the entire word.

Possible words that fit the pattern S?IN? and avoid R,A,E,T,G:

Let's list some:

- ""SPINY"": S P I N Y -> P at 2, Y at 5. But Y is at the end? And we don't know if Y is in the word? Also, check letters: P and Y are not forbidden? But we haven't tried them. However, ""spiny"" is a word? Yes, meaning having spines.

- ""SHINS"": S H I N S -> H at 2, S at 5. But we already know S is at position 1? And we have S at 5? But the secret word might have two S's? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates? However, in the first guess, we had only one S and it was marked as present but not at 4. Now we have S at 1 and if we put S at 5, that's possible? But note: in the first guess, we had S at position 4? But that was marked as not at 4? It didn't say anything about other positions? So if the word has two S's, then in the first guess, the S at position 4 would be marked as present (but wrong position) even if there is another S? 

But in our second guess, we have S at position 1 and it was marked as correct? So the secret word has at least one S at position 1. Now, if we put S at position 5, and if the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 5 would be marked as absent? Or if it has two S's, then it might be marked as present? 

But we don't know? However, we are trying to guess the word? We can try ""shins"", but let's see the pattern: S H I N S -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:S. 

But we know the secret word has S at 1 and N at 4? So if we guess ""shins"", we are testing H at 2 and S at 5? 

But we have only two positions to fill? We can try to guess the entire word? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests new letters? 

But note: we have two unknowns? We can try to use a word that has common letters for position 2 and 5? 

Another word: ""SKINS"": S K I N S -> K at 2, S at 5? But we don't know about K? 

""SPINS"": S P I N S -> P at 2, S at 5? 

But we don't know if the secret word has two S's? 

We can avoid the double S? 

Another word: ""SHINE"": but E is not allowed? We know E is not in the word? So avoid E.

""SHINY"": S H I N Y -> H at 2, Y at 5? 

""SPINE"": has E -> invalid.

""SWINE"": has E -> invalid.

""SOUND"": doesn't have I at 3? 

We need I at 3 and N at 4? 

So the pattern is fixed: S ? I N ? 

We can try:

- ""SHINY"": S H I N Y -> H and Y are new? 
- ""SPINY"": S P I N Y -> P and Y? 
- ""SKINT"": but T is not allowed? T is eliminated? 
- ""SCION"": S C I O N -> but then position 4 is O? But we need position 4 to be N? So no? 

Wait, we know position 4 is N? So the word must end with ""IN"" at positions 3 and 4? 

So the pattern is: S [letter] I N [letter]

We can list possible words:

- ""SHINS"" (if we allow double S? but we don't know if the fifth letter is S? and we have S at 1 already? so if the word has two S's, then the fifth could be S? but we don't know? and we are avoiding R,A,E,T,G? so S is allowed? but we already know S is in the word? so it's okay? but we are testing if there is an S at the end? 

But we have limited guesses? We can try to avoid double letters? 

Another word: ""SHINE"" -> invalid because of E.

""SHINY"": S H I N Y -> valid? 

""SPINY"": S P I N Y -> valid? 

""SWING"": but G is not allowed? G is eliminated? 

""SMITH"": has T? T is eliminated? 

""SLING"": has G? eliminated? 

""STING"": we already tried? 

So the options are limited? 

We can try ""shiny"" or ""spiny""? 

But we have two positions? We can also try ""scion""? but that doesn't have N at position 4? 

Wait, ""scion"" is S C I O N -> positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:I, 4:O, 5:N -> but we need position 4 to be N? So that doesn't match? 

We know position 4 is N? So the word must be S ? I N ? 

So the fifth letter is the last letter? 

Another word: ""OPINE"" -> doesn't start with S? 

We must start with S? 

So let's think of words: 

- ""shins"": S H I N S -> but we have S at 1 and S at 5? 
- ""skins"": S K I N S -> same? 
- ""spins"": S P I N S -> same? 

But also: 

- ""shiny"": S H I N Y
- ""spiny"": S P I N Y
- ""swine"": invalid because of E? 
- ""saint"": has A? invalid? 
- ""slyly"": doesn't have I at 3? 

What about ""sabin""? Not a common word? 

""SAVIN"": S A V I N -> but A is invalid? 

We need to avoid A? 

So the common words are: ""shins"", ""skins"", ""spins"", ""shiny"", ""spiny"", ""swing"" (but G is invalid), etc.

But we know G is not in the word? So ""swing"" is invalid? 

So we have:

- ""shins"": S H I N S
- ""skins"": S K I N S
- ""spins"": S P I N S
- ""shiny"": S H I N Y
- ""spiny"": S P I N Y

We also have ""sains""? Not common? 

""SOUND"": doesn't fit pattern? 

We can try to use a word that has a vowel in position 2? Like O or U? 

For example: ""SOUND"" -> no? 

""SOULS"": doesn't have I at 3? 

We need I at 3? 

""SOLID"": S O L I D -> but then position 3 is L? not I? 

We need position 3 to be I? 

So the pattern is fixed: S [consonant?] I N [consonant or vowel?]

But we can try ""suing""? S U I N G -> but G is invalid? 

""SUINT"": S U I N T -> but T is invalid? 

So we are left with the list above? 

Now, we have to choose one? 

We can try ""shiny"" because it tests two new letters: H and Y? 

But note: we don't have to use a word that has the known letters? We already know S, I, N? So we can use a word that has S at 1, I at 3, N at 4? and then two new letters? 

But we are trying to guess the word? 

Alternatively, we can try to get more information? But we have only two positions? We can try to guess the entire word? 

But we have 4 tries? So we can try one of these? 

But we don't know which? 

We can try ""shiny"" and if it's not correct, we get feedback on H and Y? 

But if we try ""shins"", we are testing if the fifth letter is S? 

But we already know S is at position 1? So if the fifth letter is S, then we get a ✓ for the last S? 

But if it's not, then we get an x? 

Similarly, for ""shiny"", we test Y? 

But we don't have much information? 

We can also consider that the secret word might be ""shins"" or ""skins"" or ""spins"" or ""shiny"" or ""spiny""? 

But we can try to use a word that has letters that are common? 

Another idea: we can try a word that doesn't have S at the end? to avoid the double S? 

For example, ""shiny"" or ""spiny""? 

But we don't know? 

We can try ""spiny"": 

  If we guess ""spiny"": 
    S: ✓ (position 1)
    P: ? (position 2: if the secret word has P at position 2, then ✓; if not, then x or -? but we don't know if P is in the word? 
    I: ✓ (position 3)
    N: ✓ (position 4)
    Y: ? (position 5: if the secret word has Y at position 5, then ✓; else x or -? but if it's not at 5, but elsewhere? but we have only 5 positions? and we know the first four? so if Y is in the word, it must be at position 5? because the other positions are fixed? 

Actually, the secret word is S ? I N ? 

So the only unknown positions are 2 and 5? 

Therefore, if we guess ""spiny"", then:

  Position 2: P -> if the secret word has P at position 2, then ✓; if not, then if P is in the word at all? but the only other position is 5? but we are putting Y at 5? so if the secret word has P at position 5? then we would get a '-' for P? but we are putting P at position 2? 

But the secret word has fixed positions: 1:S, 3:I, 4:N? and positions 2 and 5 are unknown? 

So if we guess ""spiny"", then:

  Position 1: S -> ✓
  Position 2: P -> if the secret word has P at position 2, then ✓; if the secret word has P at position 5, then we get a '-' for P? because it's in the word but not at position 2? and if the secret word doesn't have P at all, then x? 
  Position 3: I -> ✓
  Position 4: N -> ✓
  Position 5: Y -> similarly, if the secret word has Y at position 5, then ✓; if it has Y at position 2, then we get a '-' for Y? but we are putting Y at 5? 

But the secret word has only two unknown positions? So the letter at position 2 and 5? 

Therefore, the feedback for position 2 and 5 will be:

  For the letter at position 2 in the guess (P): 
    - If the secret word has P at position 2: ✓
    - If the secret word has P at position 5: then P is in the word but not at position 2 -> so '-' 
    - If the secret word doesn't have P at all: x

  Similarly for Y at position 5:
    - If the secret word has Y at position 5: ✓
    - If the secret word has Y at position 2: then Y is in the word but not at position 5 -> so '-' 
    - If the secret word doesn't have Y: x

But note: the secret word has exactly two letters: one at position 2 and one at position 5? 

So the possibilities for the secret word are:

  The letter at position 2: one of the allowed letters? 
  The letter at position 5: one of the allowed letters? 

And they are distinct? Or can be the same? 

They can be the same? For example, ""shins"" has S at 1 and S at 5? 

So if we guess ""spiny"", we might get:

  Case 1: the secret word is ""spiny"": then we get all ✓? 
  Case 2: the secret word has P at position 2 and a different letter at 5? then we get P✓ and Y? 
  Case 3: the secret word has a different letter at 2 and Y at 5? then we get for P: x or -? and for Y: ✓? 
  Case 4: the secret word has P at position 5? then we get for P: '-' (because we put it at 2 but it's at 5) and for Y: if the secret word has the letter at position 2? then we put Y at 5? so if the secret word has Y at position 2? then we get for Y: '-'? because it's at position 2 but we put it at 5? 

This might be confusing? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has two new letters that are common? 

But we have to choose one? 

We can try ""shiny"" to test H and Y? 

But we don't know? 

We can also consider the frequency of letters? 

Common letters for position 2: H, P, K, L, etc.

Common letters for position 5: S, Y, D, etc. but D is not tested? 

But we know the word must be a valid English word? 

We can try ""shiny"" because it is a common word? 

But let's see: if we guess ""shiny"", and if the secret word is ""shins"", then we get:

  S: ✓
  H: ✓ (if H is at position 2? then ✓? but if the secret word is ""shins"", then H is at position 2? so ✓? 
  I: ✓
  N: ✓
  Y: ? -> but the secret word has S at position 5? so we put Y at 5? but the secret word has S at 5? so Y is not in the word? so we get x for Y? 

So feedback: S(✓) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) Y(x)

Then we know the secret word is S H I N ? and the last letter is not Y? and we know it must be one of the letters we haven't eliminated? and we know it must be a letter that forms a word? 

But we also know that the secret word has S? and we have S at position 1? so the last letter could be S? 

Then we can guess ""shins"" next? 

Similarly, if we guess ""spiny"" and the secret word is ""spins"", then:

  S: ✓
  P: ✓ (if ""spins"" has P at position 2? then ✓? 
  I: ✓
  N: ✓
  Y: x (because ""spins"" has S at 5? not Y? 

Then we know the last letter is not Y? and we can guess ""spins"" next? 

But we have 4 tries? So we can afford to do that? 

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that has a letter that covers multiple possibilities? 

But it's difficult? 

We can also try ""sains""? but not common? 

Another word: ""scind""? not common? 

I think ""shiny"" is a good guess? 

But let me check the frequency? 

We can try ""shins"" directly? 

But if we guess ""shins"" and it's not the word, then we get feedback? 

For example, if we guess ""shins"":

  S at 1: ✓ (we know)
  H at 2: ? 
  I at 3: ✓
  N at 4: ✓
  S at 5: ? 

The feedback for H: 
  If the secret word has H at position 2, then ✓? 
  If the secret word has H at position 5? then we get '-' for H? but we put H at 2? 
  But the secret word has position 2 and 5? 

But if the secret word is ""skins"", then:

  S at 1: ✓
  H at 2: x (because ""skins"" has K at 2? so H is not in the word? 
  I: ✓
  N: ✓
  S at 5: ✓ (because ""skins"" has S at 5? 

So feedback: S(✓) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) S(✓)

Then we know the secret word is S ? I N S, and H is not in the word? 

Then we can guess ""skins"" or ""spins""? 

Similarly, if we guess ""shins"" and the secret word is ""shiny"", then:

  S: ✓
  H: ✓
  I: ✓
  N: ✓
  S: x (because the secret word has Y at 5? not S? 

So feedback: S(✓) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) S(x)

Then we know the last letter is not S? and we can guess ""shiny"" next? 

But we have only two positions? and we are testing one word? 

But we have 4 tries? So we can do that? 

But we want to be efficient? 

We can try to use a word that doesn't reuse S? to avoid the double letter? 

For example, ""shiny"" or ""spiny""? 

I think ""shiny"" is a good guess? 

Let me choose ""shiny"" as the next guess? 

So <guess>shiny</guess> 

But we are not sure? 

Another idea: we can try a word that has a vowel in position 2? to cover the possibility of a vowel? 

For example, ""suing"" is invalid? 

""sound"" doesn't fit? 

""sozin""? not a word? 

I think ""shiny"" is acceptable? 

So I'll go with ""shiny"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""raise""** → R(absent), A(absent), I(correct position), S(present but wrong position), E(absent).  
  This reveals:  
  - I is in the secret word at position 3.  
  - S is in the secret word but not at position 4.  
  - R, A, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: ""sting""** → S(correct position), T(absent), I(correct position), N(correct position), G(absent).  
  This reveals:  
  - S is at position 1.  
  - N is at position 4.  
  - T and G are not in the word.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word pattern**: `S _ I N _` (positions: 1=S, 3=I, 4=N).  
- **Known absent letters**: R, A, E, T, G.  
- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 5.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Position 2 and 5 must be filled with letters not in {R, A, E, T, G}.  
  - The word must include S (already placed at position 1) and cannot have S at position 4 (from first guess).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to guess a valid 5-letter word fitting `S _ I N _`.  
- Focus on testing common letters for positions 2 and 5 (e.g., H, Y, P, L, O, U) to maximize information.  
- Avoid absent letters (R, A, E, T, G).  
- ""shiny"" is a strong candidate:  
  - Fits the pattern: S (position 1), H (tests position 2), I (position 3), N (position 4), Y (tests position 5).  
  - Tests two new common letters (H and Y).  
  - If incorrect, feedback on H and Y will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if H is correct, absent, or misplaced; same for Y).  

### Why ""shiny""?
- If correct, we solve the word.  
- If not, feedback will reveal:  
  - Whether H is in position 2 (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x).  
  - Whether Y is in position 5 (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x).  
- This will leave only a few possibilities for the next guess (e.g., ""shins"", ""skins"", ""spins"", or ""spiny"").",Guess 3: shiny -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
