We are on the second guess. The previous guess was ""crane"" and the feedback was: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)

Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word (x).
- R is not in the secret word (x).
- A is not in the secret word (x).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (✓). This means the fourth letter of the secret word is N.
- E is not in the secret word (x).

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word must have 'N' as the fourth letter.
- The letters C, R, A, E are all absent from the word. We should avoid using these letters again.

We need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
1. Does not contain C, R, A, E.
2. Has 'N' in the fourth position.

The word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of possible words:
- The fourth letter is fixed as 'N'.
- We need to choose the first, second, third, and fifth letters from the remaining alphabet excluding C, R, A, E.

Common letters to try: We might want to cover more common letters to get information.

List of letters we know are not in the word: C, R, A, E.

Also, note: We don't know about other vowels. The word must have vowels. Remaining vowels: I, O, U (sometimes Y, but we can consider that too).

Possible strategies:
Since we know N is in position 4, we can try a word that has common consonants and vowels in the other positions.

For example, let's consider words ending with N, but note that the fourth position is the second last? Actually, in a 5-letter word:
Position: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?

So we need a word with pattern _ _ _ N _

Let's think of common words:
- Words like ""BLACK"", but we can't use A or C -> rejected.
- Words like ""TRAIN"", but we can't use R or A -> rejected.

We need words without C, R, A, E.

Some possibilities:
- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> pattern: ? ? ? N ? -> fits: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T.
  But does it avoid the bad letters? Yes, no C,R,A,E.

Other options:
- ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> similarly avoids bad letters.

But we don't know if J is too rare? Maybe we can try a word with more common letters.

Another idea: ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> avoids C,R,A,E.

Or ""FOUND"": F, O, U, N, D -> avoids C,R,A,E, but we don't know if U is present.

We could also try ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> but wait, the N is in the third position? We need N in fourth.

So for ""MINTS"": positions: 1:M, 2:I, 3:N, 4:T, 5:S -> the fourth letter is T, not N -> invalid because we must have N in the fourth.

So the word must have the fourth letter as N.

Let me list some words that have N as the fourth letter and don't contain C,R,A,E:

Possible words:
- POINT: P, O, I, N, T -> positions: 1=P, 2=O, 3=I, 4=N, 5=T
- JOINT: J, O, I, N, T
- MOUNT: M, O, U, N, T -> 1=M, 2=O, 3=U, 4=N, 5=T
- COUNT: C is excluded -> no, because C is bad -> wait, feedback said C(x), so C is bad -> avoid.
- FOUND: F, O, U, N, D -> avoids bad letters? F, O, U, N, D -> no C,R,A,E -> valid.
- WOUND: W, O, U, N, D -> valid.
- BOUND: But B is not excluded? Wait, we don't know about B yet. However, in ""crane"" we only know C,R,A,E are bad. So B was not tested -> can be used.

But note: We must avoid using any of the bad letters: C, R, A, E.

Now, to maximize information, we might choose a word with letters we haven't tried yet and that are common.

Let's take a look at the alphabet. We have tried: C, R, A, N, E.

So we know about C, R, A, E (all bad) and N (good in position 4).

We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in the remaining positions.

For example, we can try including S, T, L, etc.

Among the words I thought:
- POINT: letters P, O, I, T. These are all new. O and I are vowels which might be useful.
- MOUNT: M, O, U, T.
- FOUND: F, O, U, D -> but F and D might be less common? Also, we can get information about O and U.

But note: we want to avoid E, so that's good.

Another possibility: ""JOINS"": J, O, I, N, S -> wait, fourth letter is N? Positions: 1=J, 2=O, 3=I, 4=N, 5=S -> valid. But J is rare.

We might prefer words without uncommon letters.

Top words after CRANE that are common: in Wordle, a second guess might be something like ""POINT"" or ""MOIST"", but note MOIST: M, O, I, S, T -> however, we require N in fourth position? No, it doesn't have N in the fourth -> we must have the fourth letter as N.

So we must pick a word with N as the fourth letter.

Let me think of more: 
- ""BORNS"": not a word? ""BORNS"" is not valid.
- ""BORNE"": but E is excluded -> invalid.
- ""HORNS"": H, O, R, N, S -> but R is excluded -> invalid.
- ""TURNS"": T, U, R, N, S -> R excluded -> invalid.
- ""GOWNS"": G, O, W, N, S -> avoids bad letters? Yes: no C,R,A,E. Pattern: ...? Fourth letter is N? Positions: 1=G, 2=O, 3=W, 4=N, 5=S -> valid word? ""GOWNS"" is plural of ""gown"", so yes.

We have several options: POINT, JOINT, MOUNT, FOUND, WOUND, GOWNS, etc.

Which one has the most common letters? Point has O, I, T which are common. Mount has O, U, T. FOUND has O, U, D.

To cover more ground, we might choose a word that includes letters that often appear together and we haven't tested.

Since the fourth letter is fixed as N, we might focus on getting information about the other positions.

Alternative: We could use a word that has two of the same letter? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But let's pick a common word: I'll go with ""POINT"" because it has common letters.

So, guess: POINT

But let's check: P, O, I, N, T -> and avoid C,R,A,E. Yes.

Therefore, I will guess ""POINT"".

However, note that we also might consider ""STINT"": S, T, I, N, T -> but uses T twice? And we haven't tested S and T, and we know we need to avoid bad letters. STINT: S,T,I,N,T -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=I, 4=N, 5=T -> has N in fourth, and no C,R,A,E. But it has two T's. That might be acceptable if the word has duplicate letters.

But we don't know, so it's fine to avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.

Thus, ""POINT"" seems good.

Another common word: ""PIANO"" but wait, fourth letter is O? Not N -> invalid.

""PLAIN"": has A -> invalid.

Considering, I think ""POINT"" is a good choice.

So, our second guess will be ""point"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word (x).  
- N is in the correct position (fourth letter) (✓).  

For the next guess:  
- Must avoid C, R, A, E.  
- Must have 'N' as the fourth letter.  
- Use common, untested letters like P, O, I, T to gather more information.  
- ""POINT"" fits: P, O, I, N, T – avoids excluded letters and targets common vowels/consonants.

- MOUNT: M, O, U, N, T -> 1=M, 2=O, 3=U, 4=N, 5=T
- COUNT: C is excluded -> no, because C is bad -> wait, feedback said C(x), so C is bad -> avoid.
- FOUND: F, O, U, N, D -> avoids bad letters? F, O, U, N, D -> no C,R,A,E -> valid.
- WOUND: W, O, U, N, D -> valid.
- BOUND: But B is not excluded? Wait, we don't know about B yet. However, in ""crane"" we only know C,R,A,E are bad. So B was not tested -> can be used.

But note: We must avoid using any of the bad letters: C, R, A, E.

Now, to maximize information, we might choose a word with letters we haven't tried yet and that are common.

Let's take a look at the alphabet. We have tried: C, R, A, N, E.

So we know about C, R, A, E (all bad) and N (good in position 4).

We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in the remaining positions.

For example, we can try including S, T, L, etc.

Among the words I thought:
- POINT: letters P, O, I, T. These are all new. O and I are vowels which might be useful.
- MOUNT: M, O, U, T.
- FOUND: F, O, U, D -> but F and D might be less common? Also, we can get information about O and U.

But note: we want to avoid E, so that's good.

Another possibility: ""JOINS"": J, O, I, N, S -> wait, fourth letter is N? Positions: 1=J, 2=O, 3=I, 4=N, 5=S -> valid. But J is rare.

We might prefer words without uncommon letters.

Top words after CRANE that are common: in Wordle, a second guess might be something like ""POINT"" or ""MOIST"", but note MOIST: M, O, I, S, T -> however, we require N in fourth position? No, it doesn't have N in the fourth -> we must have the fourth letter as N.

So we must pick a word with N as the fourth letter.

Let me think of more: 
- ""BORNS"": not a word? ""BORNS"" is not valid.
- ""BORNE"": but E is excluded -> invalid.
- ""HORNS"": H, O, R, N, S -> but R is excluded -> invalid.
- ""TURNS"": T, U, R, N, S -> R excluded -> invalid.
- ""GOWNS"": G, O, W, N, S -> avoids bad letters? Yes: no C,R,A,E. Pattern: ...? Fourth letter is N? Positions: 1=G, 2=O, 3=W, 4=N, 5=S -> valid word? ""GOWNS"" is plural of ""gown"", so yes.

We have several options: POINT, JOINT, MOUNT, FOUND, WOUND, GOWNS, etc.

Which one has the most common letters? Point has O, I, T which are common. Mount has O, U, T. FOUND has O, U, D.

To cover more ground, we might choose a word that includes letters that often appear together and we haven't tested.

Since the fourth letter is fixed as N, we might focus on getting information about the other positions.

Alternative: We could use a word that has two of the same letter? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But let's pick a common word: I'll go with ""POINT"" because it has common letters.

So, guess: POINT

But let's check: P, O, I, N, T -> and avoid C,R,A,E. Yes.

Therefore, I will guess ""POINT"".

However, note that we also might consider ""STINT"": S, T, I, N, T -> but uses T twice? And we haven't tested S and T, and we know we need to avoid bad letters. STINT: S,T,I,N,T -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=I, 4=N, 5=T -> has N in fourth, and no C,R,A,E. But it has two T's. That might be acceptable if the word has duplicate letters.

But we don't know, so it's fine to avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.

Thus, ""POINT"" seems good.

Another common word: ""PIANO"" but wait, fourth letter is O? Not N -> invalid.

""PLAIN"": has A -> invalid.

Considering, I think ""POINT"" is a good choice.

So, our second guess will be ""point"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word (x).  
- N is in the correct position (fourth letter) (✓).  

For the next guess:  
- Must avoid C, R, A, E.  
- Must have 'N' as the fourth letter.  
- Use common, untested letters like P, O, I, T to gather more information.  
- ""POINT"" fits: P, O, I, N, T – avoids excluded letters and targets common vowels/consonants.

We are on the third guess. Previous feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
Meaning: 
- C, R, A, E are absent from the secret word.
- N is present and in the correct position (4th letter).

Guess 2: ""point"" -> P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(-)
Meaning:
- P and O are absent (not in the word at all).
- I is present and in the correct position (3rd letter? Let's check: in ""point"", I is the third letter, so position 3 is I).
- N is present and correct (4th letter, as before).
- T is present but in the wrong position (marked with -). So T is in the word, but not in the 5th position.

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word has the 3rd letter as I and the 4th letter as N. So the word pattern is: _ _ I N _
2. The letters C, R, A, E, P, O are absent (so we must avoid these).
3. T is present but not in the 5th position. Since the 5th position is the only one we haven't constrained much, and T is not there, it must be in either position 1 or 2.

Also, note that we have two confirmed letters: I (pos3) and N (pos4). T is also confirmed to be in the word, but not in position 5.

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] I N [letter5]

Constraints:
- letter1, letter2, letter5 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C,R,A,E,P,O (and also excluding I and N? No, I and N are already placed, but we can't use them again in other positions? Actually, we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but since we haven't seen duplicates, and to be safe, we should avoid using I and N in other positions unless necessary. But T is already present, so we can use T only once? We know T is present, so if we use T again, it might be a duplicate, but we don't know if the word has two T's. So we should avoid using T in positions where it might conflict? Actually, we can use T in position 1 or 2 to test, but we know it's not in position 5.

But we have to form a valid English word.

Known absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (and T is known to be present, so it must be in the word, but we don't know where except not at the end).

Since T is present and not in position 5, it must be in position 1 or 2.

So the word can be:
Option 1: T _ I N _  (with T in position 1)
Option 2: _ T I N _  (with T in position 2)

But we don't know which one. Also, the last letter is unknown.

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only available letters.

Moreover, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's list possible words.

First, pattern: T _ I N _

The second letter must be one of the available letters, and the last letter must be one of the available letters (and not T, because if T were in the last position, it would have been marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in guess2, T was in position 5 and marked as wrong position, so it cannot be in position 5. But in this pattern, the last position is not T, so that's fine.

Possible words for T _ I N _:
- TAINT: but A is absent -> invalid.
- THINK: H and K are available? H is available, K is available. But let's check: T, H, I, N, K -> positions: 1=T, 2=H, 3=I, 4=N, 5=K. And no absent letters: A is absent but not used. So valid? But we have to avoid A, which we are. However, we don't know if H and K are in the word. But that's okay, we are guessing.

But note: in ""think"", the second letter is H and the last is K.

Another: TRAIN -> R and A absent -> invalid.
TWINS: T, W, I, N, S -> W and S available. Valid word.
TWINE: E absent -> invalid.
TOUCH: O and U? But O is absent -> invalid.
Actually, O is absent, so no.

More: THING: T, H, I, N, G -> G available. Valid.

Now, pattern: _ T I N _

So first letter and last letter to fill.

Examples:
- UTILE: but U is available? But the pattern is _ T I N _, so it must end with something. UTILE doesn't have N? No, it's U T I L E -> not matching pattern.

We need words that have T in second position, I in third, N in fourth.

So: ? T I N ?

Examples:
- STING: S, T, I, N, G -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=I, 4=N, 5=G. S and G available. And no absent letters. Valid.
- STINK: S, T, I, N, K -> valid.
- STINT: S, T, I, N, T -> but T is repeated. We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But in feedback, we haven't seen a duplicate yet. However, it's a valid word. But if we use STINT, and if the secret word has only one T, then the T in position 5 would be marked as absent? But in our case, we know T is present, but not in position 5. If the word has two T's, then it might be okay. But we don't know. So to avoid confusion, maybe avoid duplicates for now.

But STINT is a word.

Other words: UTILE doesn't fit. 
ATONE: A and O absent -> invalid.
MUTIN: M, U, T, I, N -> but pattern requires second letter T, so it would be M U T I N? No, that's positions: 1=M, 2=U, 3=T, 4=I, 5=N -> but we need I in third and N in fourth, so not matching.

We need the third letter to be I and fourth to be N, so the word must end with ""IN"" plus the last letter? Actually, the last three letters are ""I N ?"".

For pattern _ T I N _: the word is [letter1] T I N [letter5]

So: 
- STING: S T I N G
- STINK: S T I N K
- STINT: S T I N T
- PTING: not a word.
- FTING: not a word.
- HTING: not a word.

Also: 
- OTARY: but O absent and not matching.

Another: ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> but E is absent -> invalid.

""SATIN"" -> S A T I N -> A absent -> invalid.

So the main options for _ T I N _ are words starting with S and then T, like STING, STINK, STINT.

But we also have the other pattern: T _ I N _

With words like THINK, THING, TWINS, etc.

Now, we also have to consider that in the first pattern (T _ I N _), the second letter is unknown, and last letter is unknown.

We need to choose a word that can help us distinguish between the two patterns and also test new letters.

But note: we have two possible patterns. We don't know if T is in position 1 or 2.

We can try to guess a word that fits one of the patterns and tests the other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't necessarily fit the patterns but tests other letters? But that might not be efficient because we have two confirmed letters and one confirmed letter (T) that must be placed.

Since we have limited guesses, it's better to stick to words that have I in position 3 and N in position 4, and T in either position 1 or 2, and then the remaining positions.

But we don't know which pattern, so we have to choose one.

We can also consider that if we choose a word with T in position 1, then we can confirm if T is in position 1 or not.

Similarly, if we choose a word with T in position 2, we can confirm that.

But we have to form a valid word.

Let me list all possible words that fit the pattern and use only available letters.

Pattern 1: T ? I N ?  (with ? being any available letter except the absent ones, and not I or N? But I and N are already placed, so we can use them again? But we don't know duplicates. Since we have I and N already, and T is present, it's unlikely to have duplicates, but possible. To be safe, avoid using I and N in other positions.

So for T ? I N ?:
- Second position: can be B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but not C,R,A,E,P,O, and not I,N,T? T is already used in position 1, so if we use T again, duplicate. But we don't know if duplicate T is allowed. So we can avoid for now.
- Last position: similarly, available letters, and not T (because T is not in position 5, and if we put T there, it would be wrong, but we know T is not in position 5, so we shouldn't put T there).

So for T ? I N ?:
- THINK: T H I N K -> H and K are new.
- THING: T H I N G -> H and G new.
- THINS: T H I N S -> H and S new. ""Thins"" is a word.
- TWINS: T W I N S -> W and S new.
- TWINE: but E absent -> invalid.
- TWINK: T W I N K -> valid? ""Twink"" is a word (informal, but in dictionaries).
- BLINT: B L I N T -> but pattern: B L I N T -> positions: 1=B, 2=L, 3=I, 4=N, 5=T -> but T is in position 5, which we know is wrong? In this case, if we use ""blint"", the T is at the end, but we know from feedback that T is not in position 5. So we cannot use a word with T in position 5. Therefore, for the last position, we must not use T.

So in T ? I N ?, the last position cannot be T.

Similarly, for the second pattern: ? T I N ?
- First position: available letters, not T (because T is in position 2), and not absent ones.
- Last position: available letters, not T.

Examples: STING, STINK, STINT (but STINT has T at the end, which is position 5, but we know T is not in position 5, so STINT is invalid because it would place T in position 5, which is not allowed).

STING: S T I N G -> last letter G, not T -> valid.
STINK: S T I N K -> last letter K, not T -> valid.

Also, UTINY? Not a word.
PTING: not a word.

Another: ""STILL"" -> but not ending with IN? S T I L L -> positions: 3=I, but 4=L, not N -> invalid.

So only a few options.

Now, we have to choose one.

But note: we also have the letter T that must be placed in position 1 or 2.

We can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we have to commit to one pattern.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position 1 and a common second letter, like THINK.

Or we can choose a word that has T in position 2, like STING.

But we don't know which one is correct.

We can also consider that if we choose THINK, for example, and if T is not in position 1, then we will get feedback that T is not in the word? But we know T is in the word, so if we put T in position 1 and it's not correct, then the feedback will show T as present but wrong position (since T is in the word). Similarly, if we put T in position 2 and it's not correct, same thing.

But we can get information.

Let's think about the feedback we will get.

Suppose we guess THINK: T H I N K

If the secret word has T in position 1, then T will be marked as correct (✓). Also, H, I, N, K will be checked.

If the secret word has T in position 2, then in THINK, T is in position 1, which is wrong, so T will be marked as present but wrong position (-). And H in position 2 will be checked: if the word has H, it might be marked accordingly.

Similarly, for STING: S T I N G

If T is in position 1 of the secret word, then in STING, T is in position 2, so it would be marked as present but wrong position. And S in position 1 would be checked.

If T is in position 2, then T in STING is correct.

So in either case, by guessing a word that has T in a specific position, we can determine where T is.

Moreover, we also test other letters.

Now, which one to choose? We can choose either.

But let's see which word tests more common letters.

THINK: tests T, H, K (I and N are already known).
STING: tests S, T, G.

H, K, S, G are all common.

But we also have to consider the last letter.

Another thing: we have the last letter of the secret word to find.

In THINK, we are guessing K as the last letter.
In STING, G as the last letter.

We don't know which is more likely.

But we can look for words that have many possible last letters.

Since we have limited time, I'll pick THINK because it's a common word.

But let's see if there is a word that can cover more.

Another idea: we can guess a word that doesn't have T in position 1 or 2, but that might be wasteful because we know T must be in 1 or 2.

For example, if we guess a word with T in position 1, and it's not correct, then T must be in position 2.

Similarly, if we guess with T in position 2 and it's not correct, then T must be in position 1.

So we can use the guess to test the position of T.

Moreover, by testing other letters, we get information.

So I think THINK is a good choice.

But let's confirm the available letters: we are using T, H, I, N, K. I and N are known, T is known present, H and K are new.

If we get feedback, we will know about H and K.

Similarly, for STING, S and G are new.

Now, to decide between THINK and STING, we can consider frequency.

But let's also consider that in the secret word, the last letter is unknown. If we guess THINK and the last letter is K, we win. If not, we know K is not in the word or not in that position.

Similarly for STING.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third.

Another word: what about ""SHINS""? But that has S H I N S -> positions: 1=S, 2=H, 3=I, 4=N, 5=S -> but we don't have T? We must include T because T is present. If we don't include T, then the feedback will show T as missing? But we know T is present, so we must include T in the guess to get more information about its position.

Important: we must include T in the guess because it is a present letter and we don't know its position. Otherwise, we won't learn where it is.

So the guess must include T, and also have I in position 3 and N in position 4.

Therefore, the only possibilities are the two patterns we discussed.

So we must choose between:

- Pattern 1: T ? I N ?  e.g., THINK, THING, TWINS, etc.
- Pattern 2: ? T I N ?  e.g., STING, STINK, etc.

I'll go with THINK because it's a very common word.

So guess: THINK

But let's write it: T H I N K

If we are wrong, we get information.

So, I think that's a good guess.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, A, and E are absent (x), and N is correct in position 4 (✓).
- **Guess 2 (point)**: P and O are absent (x), I is correct in position 3 (✓), N is correct in position 4 (✓), and T is present but in the wrong position (-).

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
   - Position 3 must be **I**.
   - Position 4 must be **N**.
   - **T** is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was marked as present but wrong position in ""point"").
2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O (cannot be used).
3. **T's Position**: T must be in position 1 or 2 (since it is present but not in 3, 4, or 5).
4. **Word Pattern**: The secret word follows one of two patterns:
   - `T _ I N _` (T in position 1)
   - `_ T I N _` (T in position 2)
5. **Available Letters**: Focus on untested common consonants and vowels (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, W) to maximize information.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the position of **T** by placing it in position 1 (to resolve ambiguity).
- Use common letters not yet tested (e.g., H, K) to gather more feedback.
- Avoid absent letters and respect known positions (I in 3, N in 4).
- ""THINK"" (T H I N K) fits perfectly:
  - Pattern: `T _ I N _` (tests T in position 1).
  - Uses new common letters (H and K).
  - Valid 5-letter word that avoids all absent letters.

If T is in position 1, feedback will confirm it (✓). If not, T must be in position 2 (and will be marked -). Feedback on H and K will also help narrow possibilities.

<guess>think</guess>",think,"We are on the third guess. Previous feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
Meaning: 
- C, R, A, E are absent from the secret word.
- N is present and in the correct position (4th letter).

Guess 2: ""point"" -> P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(-)
Meaning:
- P and O are absent (not in the word at all).
- I is present and in the correct position (3rd letter? Let's check: in ""point"", I is the third letter, so position 3 is I).
- N is present and correct (4th letter, as before).
- T is present but in the wrong position (marked with -). So T is in the word, but not in the 5th position.

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word has the 3rd letter as I and the 4th letter as N. So the word pattern is: _ _ I N _
2. The letters C, R, A, E, P, O are absent (so we must avoid these).
3. T is present but not in the 5th position. Since the 5th position is the only one we haven't constrained much, and T is not there, it must be in either position 1 or 2.

Also, note that we have two confirmed letters: I (pos3) and N (pos4). T is also confirmed to be in the word, but not in position 5.

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] I N [letter5]

Constraints:
- letter1, letter2, letter5 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C,R,A,E,P,O (and also excluding I and N? No, I and N are already placed, but we can't use them again in other positions? Actually, we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but since we haven't seen duplicates, and to be safe, we should avoid using I and N in other positions unless necessary. But T is already present, so we can use T only once? We know T is present, so if we use T again, it might be a duplicate, but we don't know if the word has two T's. So we should avoid using T in positions where it might conflict? Actually, we can use T in position 1 or 2 to test, but we know it's not in position 5.

But we have to form a valid English word.

Known absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (and T is known to be present, so it must be in the word, but we don't know where except not at the end).

Since T is present and not in position 5, it must be in position 1 or 2.

So the word can be:
Option 1: T _ I N _  (with T in position 1)
Option 2: _ T I N _  (with T in position 2)

But we don't know which one. Also, the last letter is unknown.

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only available letters.

Moreover, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's list possible words.

First, pattern: T _ I N _

The second letter must be one of the available letters, and the last letter must be one of the available letters (and not T, because if T were in the last position, it would have been marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in guess2, T was in position 5 and marked as wrong position, so it cannot be in position 5. But in this pattern, the last position is not T, so that's fine.

Possible words for T _ I N _:
- TAINT: but A is absent -> invalid.
- THINK: H and K are available? H is available, K is available. But let's check: T, H, I, N, K -> positions: 1=T, 2=H, 3=I, 4=N, 5=K. And no absent letters: A is absent but not used. So valid? But we have to avoid A, which we are. However, we don't know if H and K are in the word. But that's okay, we are guessing.

But note: in ""think"", the second letter is H and the last is K.

Another: TRAIN -> R and A absent -> invalid.
TWINS: T, W, I, N, S -> W and S available. Valid word.
TWINE: E absent -> invalid.
TOUCH: O and U? But O is absent -> invalid.
Actually, O is absent, so no.

More: THING: T, H, I, N, G -> G available. Valid.

Now, pattern: _ T I N _

So first letter and last letter to fill.

Examples:
- UTILE: but U is available? But the pattern is _ T I N _, so it must end with something. UTILE doesn't have N? No, it's U T I L E -> not matching pattern.

We need words that have T in second position, I in third, N in fourth.

So: ? T I N ?

Examples:
- STING: S, T, I, N, G -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=I, 4=N, 5=G. S and G available. And no absent letters. Valid.
- STINK: S, T, I, N, K -> valid.
- STINT: S, T, I, N, T -> but T is repeated. We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But in feedback, we haven't seen a duplicate yet. However, it's a valid word. But if we use STINT, and if the secret word has only one T, then the T in position 5 would be marked as absent? But in our case, we know T is present, but not in position 5. If the word has two T's, then it might be okay. But we don't know. So to avoid confusion, maybe avoid duplicates for now.

But STINT is a word.

Other words: UTILE doesn't fit. 
ATONE: A and O absent -> invalid.
MUTIN: M, U, T, I, N -> but pattern requires second letter T, so it would be M U T I N? No, that's positions: 1=M, 2=U, 3=T, 4=I, 5=N -> but we need I in third and N in fourth, so not matching.

We need the third letter to be I and fourth to be N, so the word must end with ""IN"" plus the last letter? Actually, the last three letters are ""I N ?"".

For pattern _ T I N _: the word is [letter1] T I N [letter5]

So: 
- STING: S T I N G
- STINK: S T I N K
- STINT: S T I N T
- PTING: not a word.
- FTING: not a word.
- HTING: not a word.

Also: 
- OTARY: but O absent and not matching.

Another: ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> but E is absent -> invalid.

""SATIN"" -> S A T I N -> A absent -> invalid.

So the main options for _ T I N _ are words starting with S and then T, like STING, STINK, STINT.

But we also have the other pattern: T _ I N _

With words like THINK, THING, TWINS, etc.

Now, we also have to consider that in the first pattern (T _ I N _), the second letter is unknown, and last letter is unknown.

We need to choose a word that can help us distinguish between the two patterns and also test new letters.

But note: we have two possible patterns. We don't know if T is in position 1 or 2.

We can try to guess a word that fits one of the patterns and tests the other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't necessarily fit the patterns but tests other letters? But that might not be efficient because we have two confirmed letters and one confirmed letter (T) that must be placed.

Since we have limited guesses, it's better to stick to words that have I in position 3 and N in position 4, and T in either position 1 or 2, and then the remaining positions.

But we don't know which pattern, so we have to choose one.

We can also consider that if we choose a word with T in position 1, then we can confirm if T is in position 1 or not.

Similarly, if we choose a word with T in position 2, we can confirm that.

But we have to form a valid word.

Let me list all possible words that fit the pattern and use only available letters.

Pattern 1: T ? I N ?  (with ? being any available letter except the absent ones, and not I or N? But I and N are already placed, so we can use them again? But we don't know duplicates. Since we have I and N already, and T is present, it's unlikely to have duplicates, but possible. To be safe, avoid using I and N in other positions.

So for T ? I N ?:
- Second position: can be B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but not C,R,A,E,P,O, and not I,N,T? T is already used in position 1, so if we use T again, duplicate. But we don't know if duplicate T is allowed. So we can avoid for now.
- Last position: similarly, available letters, and not T (because T is not in position 5, and if we put T there, it would be wrong, but we know T is not in position 5, so we shouldn't put T there).

So for T ? I N ?:
- THINK: T H I N K -> H and K are new.
- THING: T H I N G -> H and G new.
- THINS: T H I N S -> H and S new. ""Thins"" is a word.
- TWINS: T W I N S -> W and S new.
- TWINE: but E absent -> invalid.
- TWINK: T W I N K -> valid? ""Twink"" is a word (informal, but in dictionaries).
- BLINT: B L I N T -> but pattern: B L I N T -> positions: 1=B, 2=L, 3=I, 4=N, 5=T -> but T is in position 5, which we know is wrong? In this case, if we use ""blint"", the T is at the end, but we know from feedback that T is not in position 5. So we cannot use a word with T in position 5. Therefore, for the last position, we must not use T.

So in T ? I N ?, the last position cannot be T.

Similarly, for the second pattern: ? T I N ?
- First position: available letters, not T (because T is in position 2), and not absent ones.
- Last position: available letters, not T.

Examples: STING, STINK, STINT (but STINT has T at the end, which is position 5, but we know T is not in position 5, so STINT is invalid because it would place T in position 5, which is not allowed).

STING: S T I N G -> last letter G, not T -> valid.
STINK: S T I N K -> last letter K, not T -> valid.

Also, UTINY? Not a word.
PTING: not a word.

Another: ""STILL"" -> but not ending with IN? S T I L L -> positions: 3=I, but 4=L, not N -> invalid.

So only a few options.

Now, we have to choose one.

But note: we also have the letter T that must be placed in position 1 or 2.

We can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we have to commit to one pattern.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position 1 and a common second letter, like THINK.

Or we can choose a word that has T in position 2, like STING.

But we don't know which one is correct.

We can also consider that if we choose THINK, for example, and if T is not in position 1, then we will get feedback that T is not in the word? But we know T is in the word, so if we put T in position 1 and it's not correct, then the feedback will show T as present but wrong position (since T is in the word). Similarly, if we put T in position 2 and it's not correct, same thing.

But we can get information.

Let's think about the feedback we will get.

Suppose we guess THINK: T H I N K

If the secret word has T in position 1, then T will be marked as correct (✓). Also, H, I, N, K will be checked.

If the secret word has T in position 2, then in THINK, T is in position 1, which is wrong, so T will be marked as present but wrong position (-). And H in position 2 will be checked: if the word has H, it might be marked accordingly.

Similarly, for STING: S T I N G

If T is in position 1 of the secret word, then in STING, T is in position 2, so it would be marked as present but wrong position. And S in position 1 would be checked.

If T is in position 2, then T in STING is correct.

So in either case, by guessing a word that has T in a specific position, we can determine where T is.

Moreover, we also test other letters.

Now, which one to choose? We can choose either.

But let's see which word tests more common letters.

THINK: tests T, H, K (I and N are already known).
STING: tests S, T, G.

H, K, S, G are all common.

But we also have to consider the last letter.

Another thing: we have the last letter of the secret word to find.

In THINK, we are guessing K as the last letter.
In STING, G as the last letter.

We don't know which is more likely.

But we can look for words that have many possible last letters.

Since we have limited time, I'll pick THINK because it's a common word.

But let's see if there is a word that can cover more.

Another idea: we can guess a word that doesn't have T in position 1 or 2, but that might be wasteful because we know T must be in 1 or 2.

For example, if we guess a word with T in position 1, and it's not correct, then T must be in position 2.

Similarly, if we guess with T in position 2 and it's not correct, then T must be in position 1.

So we can use the guess to test the position of T.

Moreover, by testing other letters, we get information.

So I think THINK is a good choice.

But let's confirm the available letters: we are using T, H, I, N, K. I and N are known, T is known present, H and K are new.

If we get feedback, we will know about H and K.

Similarly, for STING, S and G are new.

Now, to decide between THINK and STING, we can consider frequency.

But let's also consider that in the secret word, the last letter is unknown. If we guess THINK and the last letter is K, we win. If not, we know K is not in the word or not in that position.

Similarly for STING.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third.

Another word: what about ""SHINS""? But that has S H I N S -> positions: 1=S, 2=H, 3=I, 4=N, 5=S -> but we don't have T? We must include T because T is present. If we don't include T, then the feedback will show T as missing? But we know T is present, so we must include T in the guess to get more information about its position.

Important: we must include T in the guess because it is a present letter and we don't know its position. Otherwise, we won't learn where it is.

So the guess must include T, and also have I in position 3 and N in position 4.

Therefore, the only possibilities are the two patterns we discussed.

So we must choose between:

- Pattern 1: T ? I N ?  e.g., THINK, THING, TWINS, etc.
- Pattern 2: ? T I N ?  e.g., STING, STINK, etc.

I'll go with THINK because it's a very common word.

So guess: THINK

But let's write it: T H I N K

If we are wrong, we get information.

So, I think that's a good guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, A, and E are absent (x), and N is correct in position 4 (✓).
- **Guess 2 (point)**: P and O are absent (x), I is correct in position 3 (✓), N is correct in position 4 (✓), and T is present but in the wrong position (-).

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
   - Position 3 must be **I**.
   - Position 4 must be **N**.
   - **T** is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was marked as present but wrong position in ""point"").
2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O (cannot be used).
3. **T's Position**: T must be in position 1 or 2 (since it is present but not in 3, 4, or 5).
4. **Word Pattern**: The secret word follows one of two patterns:
   - `T _ I N _` (T in position 1)
   - `_ T I N _` (T in position 2)
5. **Available Letters**: Focus on untested common consonants and vowels (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, W) to maximize information.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the position of **T** by placing it in position 1 (to resolve ambiguity).
- Use common letters not yet tested (e.g., H, K) to gather more feedback.
- Avoid absent letters and respect known positions (I in 3, N in 4).
- ""THINK"" (T H I N K) fits perfectly:
  - Pattern: `T _ I N _` (tests T in position 1).
  - Uses new common letters (H and K).
  - Valid 5-letter word that avoids all absent letters.

If T is in position 1, feedback will confirm it (✓). If not, T must be in position 2 (and will be marked -). Feedback on H and K will also help narrow possibilities.",Guess 3: think -> FEEDBACK: T(-) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) K(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,STING,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess. The previous guess was ""crane"" and the feedback was: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)

Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word (x).
- R is not in the secret word (x).
- A is not in the secret word (x).
- N is in the word and in the correct position (✓). This means the fourth letter of the secret word is N.
- E is not in the secret word (x).

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word must have 'N' as the fourth letter.
- The letters C, R, A, E are all absent from the word. We should avoid using these letters again.

We need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
1. Does not contain C, R, A, E.
2. Has 'N' in the fourth position.

The word must be a valid English word.

Let's think of possible words:
- The fourth letter is fixed as 'N'.
- We need to choose the first, second, third, and fifth letters from the remaining alphabet excluding C, R, A, E.

Common letters to try: We might want to cover more common letters to get information.

List of letters we know are not in the word: C, R, A, E.

Also, note: We don't know about other vowels. The word must have vowels. Remaining vowels: I, O, U (sometimes Y, but we can consider that too).

Possible strategies:
Since we know N is in position 4, we can try a word that has common consonants and vowels in the other positions.

For example, let's consider words ending with N, but note that the fourth position is the second last? Actually, in a 5-letter word:
Position: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?

So we need a word with pattern _ _ _ N _

Let's think of common words:
- Words like ""BLACK"", but we can't use A or C -> rejected.
- Words like ""TRAIN"", but we can't use R or A -> rejected.

We need words without C, R, A, E.

Some possibilities:
- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> pattern: ? ? ? N ? -> fits: positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T.
  But does it avoid the bad letters? Yes, no C,R,A,E.

Other options:
- ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> similarly avoids bad letters.

But we don't know if J is too rare? Maybe we can try a word with more common letters.

Another idea: ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> avoids C,R,A,E.

Or ""FOUND"": F, O, U, N, D -> avoids C,R,A,E, but we don't know if U is present.

We could also try ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> but wait, the N is in the third position? We need N in fourth.

So for ""MINTS"": positions: 1:M, 2:I, 3:N, 4:T, 5:S -> the fourth letter is T, not N -> invalid because we must have N in the fourth.

So the word must have the fourth letter as N.

Let me list some words that have N as the fourth letter and don't contain C,R,A,E:

Possible words:
- POINT: P, O, I, N, T -> positions: 1=P, 2=O, 3=I, 4=N, 5=T
- JOINT: J, O, I, N, T
- MOUNT: M, O, U, N, T -> 1=M, 2=O, 3=U, 4=N, 5=T
- COUNT: C is excluded -> no, because C is bad -> wait, feedback said C(x), so C is bad -> avoid.
- FOUND: F, O, U, N, D -> avoids bad letters? F, O, U, N, D -> no C,R,A,E -> valid.
- WOUND: W, O, U, N, D -> valid.
- BOUND: But B is not excluded? Wait, we don't know about B yet. However, in ""crane"" we only know C,R,A,E are bad. So B was not tested -> can be used.

But note: We must avoid using any of the bad letters: C, R, A, E.

Now, to maximize information, we might choose a word with letters we haven't tried yet and that are common.

Let's take a look at the alphabet. We have tried: C, R, A, N, E.

So we know about C, R, A, E (all bad) and N (good in position 4).

We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in the remaining positions.

For example, we can try including S, T, L, etc.

Among the words I thought:
- POINT: letters P, O, I, T. These are all new. O and I are vowels which might be useful.
- MOUNT: M, O, U, T.
- FOUND: F, O, U, D -> but F and D might be less common? Also, we can get information about O and U.

But note: we want to avoid E, so that's good.

Another possibility: ""JOINS"": J, O, I, N, S -> wait, fourth letter is N? Positions: 1=J, 2=O, 3=I, 4=N, 5=S -> valid. But J is rare.

We might prefer words without uncommon letters.

Top words after CRANE that are common: in Wordle, a second guess might be something like ""POINT"" or ""MOIST"", but note MOIST: M, O, I, S, T -> however, we require N in fourth position? No, it doesn't have N in the fourth -> we must have the fourth letter as N.

So we must pick a word with N as the fourth letter.

Let me think of more: 
- ""BORNS"": not a word? ""BORNS"" is not valid.
- ""BORNE"": but E is excluded -> invalid.
- ""HORNS"": H, O, R, N, S -> but R is excluded -> invalid.
- ""TURNS"": T, U, R, N, S -> R excluded -> invalid.
- ""GOWNS"": G, O, W, N, S -> avoids bad letters? Yes: no C,R,A,E. Pattern: ...? Fourth letter is N? Positions: 1=G, 2=O, 3=W, 4=N, 5=S -> valid word? ""GOWNS"" is plural of ""gown"", so yes.

We have several options: POINT, JOINT, MOUNT, FOUND, WOUND, GOWNS, etc.

Which one has the most common letters? Point has O, I, T which are common. Mount has O, U, T. FOUND has O, U, D.

To cover more ground, we might choose a word that includes letters that often appear together and we haven't tested.

Since the fourth letter is fixed as N, we might focus on getting information about the other positions.

Alternative: We could use a word that has two of the same letter? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But let's pick a common word: I'll go with ""POINT"" because it has common letters.

So, guess: POINT

But let's check: P, O, I, N, T -> and avoid C,R,A,E. Yes.

Therefore, I will guess ""POINT"".

However, note that we also might consider ""STINT"": S, T, I, N, T -> but uses T twice? And we haven't tested S and T, and we know we need to avoid bad letters. STINT: S,T,I,N,T -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=I, 4=N, 5=T -> has N in fourth, and no C,R,A,E. But it has two T's. That might be acceptable if the word has duplicate letters.

But we don't know, so it's fine to avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.

Thus, ""POINT"" seems good.

Another common word: ""PIANO"" but wait, fourth letter is O? Not N -> invalid.

""PLAIN"": has A -> invalid.

Considering, I think ""POINT"" is a good choice.

So, our second guess will be ""point"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word (x).  
- N is in the correct position (fourth letter) (✓).  

For the next guess:  
- Must avoid C, R, A, E.  
- Must have 'N' as the fourth letter.  
- Use common, untested letters like P, O, I, T to gather more information.  
- ""POINT"" fits: P, O, I, N, T – avoids excluded letters and targets common vowels/consonants.

<guess>point</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the third guess. Previous feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
Meaning: 
- C, R, A, E are absent from the secret word.
- N is present and in the correct position (4th letter).

Guess 2: ""point"" -> P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(-)
Meaning:
- P and O are absent (not in the word at all).
- I is present and in the correct position (3rd letter? Let's check: in ""point"", I is the third letter, so position 3 is I).
- N is present and correct (4th letter, as before).
- T is present but in the wrong position (marked with -). So T is in the word, but not in the 5th position.

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word has the 3rd letter as I and the 4th letter as N. So the word pattern is: _ _ I N _
2. The letters C, R, A, E, P, O are absent (so we must avoid these).
3. T is present but not in the 5th position. Since the 5th position is the only one we haven't constrained much, and T is not there, it must be in either position 1 or 2.

Also, note that we have two confirmed letters: I (pos3) and N (pos4). T is also confirmed to be in the word, but not in position 5.

So the word is: [letter1] [letter2] I N [letter5]

Constraints:
- letter1, letter2, letter5 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C,R,A,E,P,O (and also excluding I and N? No, I and N are already placed, but we can't use them again in other positions? Actually, we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but since we haven't seen duplicates, and to be safe, we should avoid using I and N in other positions unless necessary. But T is already present, so we can use T only once? We know T is present, so if we use T again, it might be a duplicate, but we don't know if the word has two T's. So we should avoid using T in positions where it might conflict? Actually, we can use T in position 1 or 2 to test, but we know it's not in position 5.

But we have to form a valid English word.

Known absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (and T is known to be present, so it must be in the word, but we don't know where except not at the end).

Since T is present and not in position 5, it must be in position 1 or 2.

So the word can be:
Option 1: T _ I N _  (with T in position 1)
Option 2: _ T I N _  (with T in position 2)

But we don't know which one. Also, the last letter is unknown.

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only available letters.

Moreover, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's list possible words.

First, pattern: T _ I N _

The second letter must be one of the available letters, and the last letter must be one of the available letters (and not T, because if T were in the last position, it would have been marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in guess2, T was in position 5 and marked as wrong position, so it cannot be in position 5. But in this pattern, the last position is not T, so that's fine.

Possible words for T _ I N _:
- TAINT: but A is absent -> invalid.
- THINK: H and K are available? H is available, K is available. But let's check: T, H, I, N, K -> positions: 1=T, 2=H, 3=I, 4=N, 5=K. And no absent letters: A is absent but not used. So valid? But we have to avoid A, which we are. However, we don't know if H and K are in the word. But that's okay, we are guessing.

But note: in ""think"", the second letter is H and the last is K.

Another: TRAIN -> R and A absent -> invalid.
TWINS: T, W, I, N, S -> W and S available. Valid word.
TWINE: E absent -> invalid.
TOUCH: O and U? But O is absent -> invalid.
Actually, O is absent, so no.

More: THING: T, H, I, N, G -> G available. Valid.

Now, pattern: _ T I N _

So first letter and last letter to fill.

Examples:
- UTILE: but U is available? But the pattern is _ T I N _, so it must end with something. UTILE doesn't have N? No, it's U T I L E -> not matching pattern.

We need words that have T in second position, I in third, N in fourth.

So: ? T I N ?

Examples:
- STING: S, T, I, N, G -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=I, 4=N, 5=G. S and G available. And no absent letters. Valid.
- STINK: S, T, I, N, K -> valid.
- STINT: S, T, I, N, T -> but T is repeated. We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But in feedback, we haven't seen a duplicate yet. However, it's a valid word. But if we use STINT, and if the secret word has only one T, then the T in position 5 would be marked as absent? But in our case, we know T is present, but not in position 5. If the word has two T's, then it might be okay. But we don't know. So to avoid confusion, maybe avoid duplicates for now.

But STINT is a word.

Other words: UTILE doesn't fit. 
ATONE: A and O absent -> invalid.
MUTIN: M, U, T, I, N -> but pattern requires second letter T, so it would be M U T I N? No, that's positions: 1=M, 2=U, 3=T, 4=I, 5=N -> but we need I in third and N in fourth, so not matching.

We need the third letter to be I and fourth to be N, so the word must end with ""IN"" plus the last letter? Actually, the last three letters are ""I N ?"".

For pattern _ T I N _: the word is [letter1] T I N [letter5]

So: 
- STING: S T I N G
- STINK: S T I N K
- STINT: S T I N T
- PTING: not a word.
- FTING: not a word.
- HTING: not a word.

Also: 
- OTARY: but O absent and not matching.

Another: ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> but E is absent -> invalid.

""SATIN"" -> S A T I N -> A absent -> invalid.

So the main options for _ T I N _ are words starting with S and then T, like STING, STINK, STINT.

But we also have the other pattern: T _ I N _

With words like THINK, THING, TWINS, etc.

Now, we also have to consider that in the first pattern (T _ I N _), the second letter is unknown, and last letter is unknown.

We need to choose a word that can help us distinguish between the two patterns and also test new letters.

But note: we have two possible patterns. We don't know if T is in position 1 or 2.

We can try to guess a word that fits one of the patterns and tests the other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't necessarily fit the patterns but tests other letters? But that might not be efficient because we have two confirmed letters and one confirmed letter (T) that must be placed.

Since we have limited guesses, it's better to stick to words that have I in position 3 and N in position 4, and T in either position 1 or 2, and then the remaining positions.

But we don't know which pattern, so we have to choose one.

We can also consider that if we choose a word with T in position 1, then we can confirm if T is in position 1 or not.

Similarly, if we choose a word with T in position 2, we can confirm that.

But we have to form a valid word.

Let me list all possible words that fit the pattern and use only available letters.

Pattern 1: T ? I N ?  (with ? being any available letter except the absent ones, and not I or N? But I and N are already placed, so we can use them again? But we don't know duplicates. Since we have I and N already, and T is present, it's unlikely to have duplicates, but possible. To be safe, avoid using I and N in other positions.

So for T ? I N ?:
- Second position: can be B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but not C,R,A,E,P,O, and not I,N,T? T is already used in position 1, so if we use T again, duplicate. But we don't know if duplicate T is allowed. So we can avoid for now.
- Last position: similarly, available letters, and not T (because T is not in position 5, and if we put T there, it would be wrong, but we know T is not in position 5, so we shouldn't put T there).

So for T ? I N ?:
- THINK: T H I N K -> H and K are new.
- THING: T H I N G -> H and G new.
- THINS: T H I N S -> H and S new. ""Thins"" is a word.
- TWINS: T W I N S -> W and S new.
- TWINE: but E absent -> invalid.
- TWINK: T W I N K -> valid? ""Twink"" is a word (informal, but in dictionaries).
- BLINT: B L I N T -> but pattern: B L I N T -> positions: 1=B, 2=L, 3=I, 4=N, 5=T -> but T is in position 5, which we know is wrong? In this case, if we use ""blint"", the T is at the end, but we know from feedback that T is not in position 5. So we cannot use a word with T in position 5. Therefore, for the last position, we must not use T.

So in T ? I N ?, the last position cannot be T.

Similarly, for the second pattern: ? T I N ?
- First position: available letters, not T (because T is in position 2), and not absent ones.
- Last position: available letters, not T.

Examples: STING, STINK, STINT (but STINT has T at the end, which is position 5, but we know T is not in position 5, so STINT is invalid because it would place T in position 5, which is not allowed).

STING: S T I N G -> last letter G, not T -> valid.
STINK: S T I N K -> last letter K, not T -> valid.

Also, UTINY? Not a word.
PTING: not a word.

Another: ""STILL"" -> but not ending with IN? S T I L L -> positions: 3=I, but 4=L, not N -> invalid.

So only a few options.

Now, we have to choose one.

But note: we also have the letter T that must be placed in position 1 or 2.

We can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we have to commit to one pattern.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position 1 and a common second letter, like THINK.

Or we can choose a word that has T in position 2, like STING.

But we don't know which one is correct.

We can also consider that if we choose THINK, for example, and if T is not in position 1, then we will get feedback that T is not in the word? But we know T is in the word, so if we put T in position 1 and it's not correct, then the feedback will show T as present but wrong position (since T is in the word). Similarly, if we put T in position 2 and it's not correct, same thing.

But we can get information.

Let's think about the feedback we will get.

Suppose we guess THINK: T H I N K

If the secret word has T in position 1, then T will be marked as correct (✓). Also, H, I, N, K will be checked.

If the secret word has T in position 2, then in THINK, T is in position 1, which is wrong, so T will be marked as present but wrong position (-). And H in position 2 will be checked: if the word has H, it might be marked accordingly.

Similarly, for STING: S T I N G

If T is in position 1 of the secret word, then in STING, T is in position 2, so it would be marked as present but wrong position. And S in position 1 would be checked.

If T is in position 2, then T in STING is correct.

So in either case, by guessing a word that has T in a specific position, we can determine where T is.

Moreover, we also test other letters.

Now, which one to choose? We can choose either.

But let's see which word tests more common letters.

THINK: tests T, H, K (I and N are already known).
STING: tests S, T, G.

H, K, S, G are all common.

But we also have to consider the last letter.

Another thing: we have the last letter of the secret word to find.

In THINK, we are guessing K as the last letter.
In STING, G as the last letter.

We don't know which is more likely.

But we can look for words that have many possible last letters.

Since we have limited time, I'll pick THINK because it's a common word.

But let's see if there is a word that can cover more.

Another idea: we can guess a word that doesn't have T in position 1 or 2, but that might be wasteful because we know T must be in 1 or 2.

For example, if we guess a word with T in position 1, and it's not correct, then T must be in position 2.

Similarly, if we guess with T in position 2 and it's not correct, then T must be in position 1.

So we can use the guess to test the position of T.

Moreover, by testing other letters, we get information.

So I think THINK is a good choice.

But let's confirm the available letters: we are using T, H, I, N, K. I and N are known, T is known present, H and K are new.

If we get feedback, we will know about H and K.

Similarly, for STING, S and G are new.

Now, to decide between THINK and STING, we can consider frequency.

But let's also consider that in the secret word, the last letter is unknown. If we guess THINK and the last letter is K, we win. If not, we know K is not in the word or not in that position.

Similarly for STING.

But we have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third.

Another word: what about ""SHINS""? But that has S H I N S -> positions: 1=S, 2=H, 3=I, 4=N, 5=S -> but we don't have T? We must include T because T is present. If we don't include T, then the feedback will show T as missing? But we know T is present, so we must include T in the guess to get more information about its position.

Important: we must include T in the guess because it is a present letter and we don't know its position. Otherwise, we won't learn where it is.

So the guess must include T, and also have I in position 3 and N in position 4.

Therefore, the only possibilities are the two patterns we discussed.

So we must choose between:

- Pattern 1: T ? I N ?  e.g., THINK, THING, TWINS, etc.
- Pattern 2: ? T I N ?  e.g., STING, STINK, etc.

I'll go with THINK because it's a very common word.

So guess: THINK

But let's write it: T H I N K

If we are wrong, we get information.

So, I think that's a good guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, A, and E are absent (x), and N is correct in position 4 (✓).
- **Guess 2 (point)**: P and O are absent (x), I is correct in position 3 (✓), N is correct in position 4 (✓), and T is present but in the wrong position (-).

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:
   - Position 3 must be **I**.
   - Position 4 must be **N**.
   - **T** is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was marked as present but wrong position in ""point"").
2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O (cannot be used).
3. **T's Position**: T must be in position 1 or 2 (since it is present but not in 3, 4, or 5).
4. **Word Pattern**: The secret word follows one of two patterns:
   - `T _ I N _` (T in position 1)
   - `_ T I N _` (T in position 2)
5. **Available Letters**: Focus on untested common consonants and vowels (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, W) to maximize information.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the position of **T** by placing it in position 1 (to resolve ambiguity).
- Use common letters not yet tested (e.g., H, K) to gather more feedback.
- Avoid absent letters and respect known positions (I in 3, N in 4).
- ""THINK"" (T H I N K) fits perfectly:
  - Pattern: `T _ I N _` (tests T in position 1).
  - Uses new common letters (H and K).
  - Valid 5-letter word that avoids all absent letters.

If T is in position 1, feedback will confirm it (✓). If not, T must be in position 2 (and will be marked -). Feedback on H and K will also help narrow possibilities.

And we haven\'t tested S and T, and we know we need to avoid bad letters. STINT: S,T,I,N,T -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=I, 4=N, 5=T -> has N in fourth, and no C,R,A,E. But it has two T\'s. That might be acceptable if the word has duplicate letters.\n\nBut we don\'t know, so it\'s fine to avoid duplicates for now to test more letters.\n\nThus, ""POINT"" seems good.\n\nAnother common word: ""PIANO"" but wait, fourth letter is O? Not N -> invalid.\n\n""PLAIN"": has A -> invalid.\n\nConsidering, I think ""POINT"" is a good choice.\n\nSo, our second guess will be ""point"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word (x).  \n- N is in the correct position (fourth letter) (✓).  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Must avoid C, R, A, E.  \n- Must have \'N\' as the fourth letter.  \n- Use common, untested letters like P, O, I, T to gather more information.  \n- ""POINT"" fits: P, O, I, N, T – avoids excluded letters and targets common vowels/consonants.\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are on the third guess. Previous feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)\nMeaning: \n- C, R, A, E are absent from the secret word.\n- N is present and in the correct position (4th letter).\n\nGuess 2: ""point"" -> P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(-)\nMeaning:\n- P and O are absent (not in the word at all).\n- I is present and in the correct position (3rd letter? Let\'s check: in ""point"", I is the third letter, so position 3 is I).\n- N is present and correct (4th letter, as before).\n- T is present but in the wrong position (marked with -). So T is in the word, but not in the 5th position.\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the 3rd letter as I and the 4th letter as N. So the word pattern is: _ _ I N _\n2. The letters C, R, A, E, P, O are absent (so we must avoid these).\n3. T is present but not in the 5th position. Since the 5th position is the only one we haven\'t constrained much, and T is not there, it must be in either position 1 or 2.\n\nAlso, note that we have two confirmed letters: I (pos3) and N (pos4). T is also confirmed to be in the word, but not in position 5.\n\nSo the word is: [letter1] [letter2] I N [letter5]\n\nConstraints:\n- letter1, letter2, letter5 must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C,R,A,E,P,O (and also excluding I and N? No, I and N are already placed, but we can\'t use them again in other positions? Actually, we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but since we haven\'t seen duplicates, and to be safe, we should avoid using I and N in other positions unless necessary. But T is already present, so we can use T only once? We know T is present, so if we use T again, it might be a duplicate, but we don\'t know if the word has two T\'s. So we should avoid using T in positions where it might conflict? Actually, we can use T in position 1 or 2 to test, but we know it\'s not in position 5.\n\nBut we have to form a valid English word.\n\nKnown absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O.\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (and T is known to be present, so it must be in the word, but we don\'t know where except not at the end).\n\nSince T is present and not in position 5, it must be in position 1 or 2.\n\nSo the word can be:\nOption 1: T _ I N _  (with T in position 1)\nOption 2: _ T I N _  (with T in position 2)\n\nBut we don\'t know which one. Also, the last letter is unknown.\n\nWe need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only available letters.\n\nMoreover, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s list possible words.\n\nFirst, pattern: T _ I N _\n\nThe second letter must be one of the available letters, and the last letter must be one of the available letters (and not T, because if T were in the last position, it would have been marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in guess2, T was in position 5 and marked as wrong position, so it cannot be in position 5. But in this pattern, the last position is not T, so that\'s fine.\n\nPossible words for T _ I N _:\n- TAINT: but A is absent -> invalid.\n- THINK: H and K are available? H is available, K is available. But let\'s check: T, H, I, N, K -> positions: 1=T, 2=H, 3=I, 4=N, 5=K. And no absent letters: A is absent but not used. So valid? But we have to avoid A, which we are. However, we don\'t know if H and K are in the word. But that\'s okay, we are guessing.\n\nBut note: in ""think"", the second letter is H and the last is K.\n\nAnother: TRAIN -> R and A absent -> invalid.\nTWINS: T, W, I, N, S -> W and S available. Valid word.\nTWINE: E absent -> invalid.\nTOUCH: O and U? But O is absent -> invalid.\nActually, O is absent, so no.\n\nMore: THING: T, H, I, N, G -> G available. Valid.\n\nNow, pattern: _ T I N _\n\nSo first letter and last letter to fill.\n\nExamples:\n- UTILE: but U is available? But the pattern is _ T I N _, so it must end with something. UTILE doesn\'t have N? No, it\'s U T I L E -> not matching pattern.\n\nWe need words that have T in second position, I in third, N in fourth.\n\nSo: ? T I N ?\n\nExamples:\n- STING: S, T, I, N, G -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=I, 4=N, 5=G. S and G available. And no absent letters. Valid.\n- STINK: S, T, I, N, K -> valid.\n- STINT: S, T, I, N, T -> but T is repeated. We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But in feedback, we haven\'t seen a duplicate yet. However, it\'s a valid word. But if we use STINT, and if the secret word has only one T, then the T in position 5 would be marked as absent? But in our case, we know T is present, but not in position 5. If the word has two T\'s, then it might be okay. But we don\'t know. So to avoid confusion, maybe avoid duplicates for now.\n\nBut STINT is a word.\n\nOther words: UTILE doesn\'t fit. \nATONE: A and O absent -> invalid.\nMUTIN: M, U, T, I, N -> but pattern requires second letter T, so it would be M U T I N? No, that\'s positions: 1=M, 2=U, 3=T, 4=I, 5=N -> but we need I in third and N in fourth, so not matching.\n\nWe need the third letter to be I and fourth to be N, so the word must end with ""IN"" plus the last letter? Actually, the last three letters are ""I N ?"".\n\nFor pattern _ T I N _: the word is [letter1] T I N [letter5]\n\nSo: \n- STING: S T I N G\n- STINK: S T I N K\n- STINT: S T I N T\n- PTING: not a word.\n- FTING: not a word.\n- HTING: not a word.\n\nAlso: \n- OTARY: but O absent and not matching.\n\nAnother: ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> but E is absent -> invalid.\n\n""SATIN"" -> S A T I N -> A absent -> invalid.\n\nSo the main options for _ T I N _ are words starting with S and then T, like STING, STINK, STINT.\n\nBut we also have the other pattern: T _ I N _\n\nWith words like THINK, THING, TWINS, etc.\n\nNow, we also have to consider that in the first pattern (T _ I N _), the second letter is unknown, and last letter is unknown.\n\nWe need to choose a word that can help us distinguish between the two patterns and also test new letters.\n\nBut note: we have two possible patterns. We don\'t know if T is in position 1 or 2.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that fits one of the patterns and tests the other positions.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t necessarily fit the patterns but tests other letters? But that might not be efficient because we have two confirmed letters and one confirmed letter (T) that must be placed.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, it\'s better to stick to words that have I in position 3 and N in position 4, and T in either position 1 or 2, and then the remaining positions.\n\nBut we don\'t know which pattern, so we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider that if we choose a word with T in position 1, then we can confirm if T is in position 1 or not.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose a word with T in position 2, we can confirm that.\n\nBut we have to form a valid word.\n\nLet me list all possible words that fit the pattern and use only available letters.\n\nPattern 1: T ? I N ?  (with ? being any available letter except the absent ones, and not I or N? But I and N are already placed, so we can use them again? But we don\'t know duplicates. Since we have I and N already, and T is present, it\'s unlikely to have duplicates, but possible. To be safe, avoid using I and N in other positions.\n\nSo for T ? I N ?:\n- Second position: can be B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but not C,R,A,E,P,O, and not I,N,T? T is already used in position 1, so if we use T again, duplicate. But we don\'t know if duplicate T is allowed. So we can avoid for now.\n- Last position: similarly, available letters, and not T (because T is not in position 5, and if we put T there, it would be wrong, but we know T is not in position 5, so we shouldn\'t put T there).\n\nSo for T ? I N ?:\n- THINK: T H I N K -> H and K are new.\n- THING: T H I N G -> H and G new.\n- THINS: T H I N S -> H and S new. ""Thins"" is a word.\n- TWINS: T W I N S -> W and S new.\n- TWINE: but E absent -> invalid.\n- TWINK: T W I N K -> valid? ""Twink"" is a word (informal, but in dictionaries).\n- BLINT: B L I N T -> but pattern: B L I N T -> positions: 1=B, 2=L, 3=I, 4=N, 5=T -> but T is in position 5, which we know is wrong? In this case, if we use ""blint"", the T is at the end, but we know from feedback that T is not in position 5. So we cannot use a word with T in position 5. Therefore, for the last position, we must not use T.\n\nSo in T ? I N ?, the last position cannot be T.\n\nSimilarly, for the second pattern: ? T I N ?\n- First position: available letters, not T (because T is in position 2), and not absent ones.\n- Last position: available letters, not T.\n\nExamples: STING, STINK, STINT (but STINT has T at the end, which is position 5, but we know T is not in position 5, so STINT is invalid because it would place T in position 5, which is not allowed).\n\nSTING: S T I N G -> last letter G, not T -> valid.\nSTINK: S T I N K -> last letter K, not T -> valid.\n\nAlso, UTINY? Not a word.\nPTING: not a word.\n\nAnother: ""STILL"" -> but not ending with IN? S T I L L -> positions: 3=I, but 4=L, not N -> invalid.\n\nSo only a few options.\n\nNow, we have to choose one.\n\nBut note: we also have the letter T that must be placed in position 1 or 2.\n\nWe can design a guess that tests both possibilities? But we have to commit to one pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has T in position 1 and a common second letter, like THINK.\n\nOr we can choose a word that has T in position 2, like STING.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one is correct.\n\nWe can also consider that if we choose THINK, for example, and if T is not in position 1, then we will get feedback that T is not in the word? But we know T is in the word, so if we put T in position 1 and it\'s not correct, then the feedback will show T as present but wrong position (since T is in the word). Similarly, if we put T in position 2 and it\'s not correct, same thing.\n\nBut we can get information.\n\nLet\'s think about the feedback we will get.\n\nSuppose we guess THINK: T H I N K\n\nIf the secret word has T in position 1, then T will be marked as correct (✓). Also, H, I, N, K will be checked.\n\nIf the secret word has T in position 2, then in THINK, T is in position 1, which is wrong, so T will be marked as present but wrong position (-). And H in position 2 will be checked: if the word has H, it might be marked accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, for STING: S T I N G\n\nIf T is in position 1 of the secret word, then in STING, T is in position 2, so it would be marked as present but wrong position. And S in position 1 would be checked.\n\nIf T is in position 2, then T in STING is correct.\n\nSo in either case, by guessing a word that has T in a specific position, we can determine where T is.\n\nMoreover, we also test other letters.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We can choose either.\n\nBut let\'s see which word tests more common letters.\n\nTHINK: tests T, H, K (I and N are already known).\nSTING: tests S, T, G.\n\nH, K, S, G are all common.\n\nBut we also have to consider the last letter.\n\nAnother thing: we have the last letter of the secret word to find.\n\nIn THINK, we are guessing K as the last letter.\nIn STING, G as the last letter.\n\nWe don\'t know which is more likely.\n\nBut we can look for words that have many possible last letters.\n\nSince we have limited time, I\'ll pick THINK because it\'s a common word.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that can cover more.\n\nAnother idea: we can guess a word that doesn\'t have T in position 1 or 2, but that might be wasteful because we know T must be in 1 or 2.\n\nFor example, if we guess a word with T in position 1, and it\'s not correct, then T must be in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess with T in position 2 and it\'s not correct, then T must be in position 1.\n\nSo we can use the guess to test the position of T.\n\nMoreover, by testing other letters, we get information.\n\nSo I think THINK is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the available letters: we are using T, H, I, N, K. I and N are known, T is known present, H and K are new.\n\nIf we get feedback, we will know about H and K.\n\nSimilarly, for STING, S and G are new.\n\nNow, to decide between THINK and STING, we can consider frequency.\n\nBut let\'s also consider that in the secret word, the last letter is unknown. If we guess THINK and the last letter is K, we win. If not, we know K is not in the word or not in that position.\n\nSimilarly for STING.\n\nBut we have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third.\n\nAnother word: what about ""SHINS""? But that has S H I N S -> positions: 1=S, 2=H, 3=I, 4=N, 5=S -> but we don\'t have T? We must include T because T is present. If we don\'t include T, then the feedback will show T as missing? But we know T is present, so we must include T in the guess to get more information about its position.\n\nImportant: we must include T in the guess because it is a present letter and we don\'t know its position. Otherwise, we won\'t learn where it is.\n\nSo the guess must include T, and also have I in position 3 and N in position 4.\n\nTherefore, the only possibilities are the two patterns we discussed.\n\nSo we must choose between:\n\n- Pattern 1: T ? I N ?  e.g., THINK, THING, TWINS, etc.\n- Pattern 2: ? T I N ?  e.g., STING, STINK, etc.\n\nI\'ll go with THINK because it\'s a very common word.\n\nSo guess: THINK\n\nBut let\'s write it: T H I N K\n\nIf we are wrong, we get information.\n\nSo, I think that\'s a good guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, A, and E are absent (x), and N is correct in position 4 (✓).\n- **Guess 2 (point)**: P and O are absent (x), I is correct in position 3 (✓), N is correct in position 4 (✓), and T is present but in the wrong position (-).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Confirmed Letters and Positions**:\n   - Position 3 must be **I**.\n   - Position 4 must be **N**.\n   - **T** is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was marked as present but wrong position in ""point"").\n2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O (cannot be used).\n3. **T\'s Position**: T must be in position 1 or 2 (since it is present but not in 3, 4, or 5).\n4. **Word Pattern**: The secret word follows one of two patterns:\n   - `T _ I N _` (T in position 1)\n   - `_ T I N _` (T in position 2)\n5. **Available Letters**: Focus on untested common consonants and vowels (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, U, W) to maximize information.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test the position of **T** by placing it in position 1 (to resolve ambiguity).\n- Use common letters not yet tested (e.g., H, K) to gather more feedback.\n- Avoid absent letters and respect known positions (I in 3, N in 4).\n- ""THINK"" (T H I N K) fits perfectly:\n  - Pattern: `T _ I N _` (tests T in position 1).\n  - Uses new common letters (H and K).\n  - Valid 5-letter word that avoids all absent letters.\n\nIf T is in position 1, feedback will confirm it (✓). If not, T must be in position 2 (and will be marked -). Feedback on H and K will also help narrow possibilities.\n\n<guess>think</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(-)\nGuess 3: think -> FEEDBACK: T(-) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) K(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are on the fourth guess. Previous feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
Meaning: C, R, A, E are absent. N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).

Guess 2: ""point"" -> P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(-)
Meaning: P and O are absent. I is in the correct position (3rd). N is in the correct position (4th). T is present but in the wrong position.

Guess 3: ""think"" -> T(-), H(x), I(✓), N(✓), K(x)
Meaning: T is present but in the wrong position (again). H is absent. I is in the correct position (3rd). N is in the correct position (4th). K is absent.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. **Confirmed Positions**:
   - Position 3: I
   - Position 4: N

2. **Present Letters**:
   - T is in the word but not in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from ""think"": T was in position 1 and marked wrong, and from ""point"": T was in position 5 and marked wrong). Therefore, T must be in position 2.

   Why?
   - In ""point"", T was in position 5 and marked as present but wrong position, so T is not in position 5.
   - In ""think"", T was in position 1 and marked as present but wrong position, so T is not in position 1.
   - Positions 3 and 4 are fixed as I and N, so T cannot be there.
   - Therefore, the only position left for T is position 2.

   So, the secret word has T in position 2.

3. **Absent Letters**:
   - From all guesses: C, R, A, E, P, O, H, K are absent.
   - Also, we have used I and N, but they are already placed.

4. **Word Pattern**:
   - Position 1: unknown (but not T, and not any absent letter)
   - Position 2: T (now confirmed)
   - Position 3: I
   - Position 4: N
   - Position 5: unknown

   So the pattern is: _ T I N _

5. **Available Letters**:
   - We must avoid: C, R, A, E, P, O, H, K.
   - We have used: T, I, N (but T, I, N are in the word, so we can use them only if necessary, but I and N are fixed, and T is fixed in position 2. For position 1 and 5, we need new letters that are not absent and not already placed? But we don't know about duplicates. Since we haven't seen duplicates, we assume no duplicates for now. So position 1 and 5 should be letters not in {T, I, N} and not absent.

   Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   But we want to use common letters to maximize information.

6. **Constraints for Position 5**:
   - We don't know much, but we can form words ending with T, I, N? But the pattern is _ T I N _, so the last letter is after N.

Now, we need to form a word that fits the pattern _ T I N _ and uses available letters.

Possible words:

- STING: S T I N G -> S and G are available? S is available, G is available. But we haven't tested S and G.
- STINK: but K is absent -> invalid.
- STINT: S T I N T -> but T is repeated. We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, in position 5, T is present, but we know T is not in position 5 (from ""point"" feedback). So STINT would have T in position 5, which is invalid because T cannot be in position 5. Therefore, STINT is not allowed.

Other words:
- BEGIN: B E G I N -> but E is absent -> invalid.
- UTILE: U T I L E -> but E absent and pattern is U T I L E, which is positions 1=U, 2=T, 3=I, 4=L, 5=E -> but we need position 4 to be N, not L. So invalid.

We need the word to end with ""IN"" and then the fifth letter.

So: ? T I N ?

Examples:
- STING: S T I N G -> valid, and S and G are new.
- USING: U S I N G -> but position 2 is S, not T -> invalid. We need position 2 to be T.
- The word must have T in position 2.

So: 
- STING: S T I N G
- Also: ETUIN? Not a word.
- PTING? Not a word.
- FTING? Not a word.
- MTING? Not a word.

Another: ""STILL"" -> S T I L L -> but position 4 is L, not N -> invalid.

""STING"" is a good candidate.

Also, ""STINK"" is invalid because K is absent.

What about ""STUNS""? S T U N S -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=U, 4=N, 5=S -> but position 3 must be I, not U -> invalid.

We need position 3 to be I.

So only ""STING"" comes to mind.

Another: ""ATTAIN"" is 6 letters.

""SATIN"" has A and not N in position 4? S A T I N -> position 2 is A, but A is absent -> invalid.

""STIVE""? Not a word.

""STING"" seems to be the most common.

But let's check: is there ""STING"" in Wordle? Yes.

Another possibility: ""STIED""? Not a word and doesn't have N.

We can consider ""STING"" or perhaps ""STIMY"" (rare) or ""STIVY"" (rare).

But ""STING"" is common.

Also, ""STING"" uses S and G, which are common and we haven't tested.

If we guess ""STING"", we are testing S in position 1 and G in position 5.

If the word is ""STING"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on S and G.

But note: we have only two positions unknown: position 1 and 5.

And we know the word is _ T I N _

With available letters.

Other words that fit the pattern:

- BTING? Not a word.
- DTING? Not a word.
- GTING? Not a word.
- JTING? Not a word.
- LTING? Not a word.
- MTING? Not a word.
- QTING? Not a word.
- STING: valid.
- UTING? Not a word, but ""using"" doesn't have T in position 2.
- VTING? Not a word.
- WTING? Not a word.
- XTING? Not a word.
- YTING? Not a word.
- ZTING? Not a word.

What about ""STING"" and ""STINK"" (but K absent).

Another: ""STILT"" -> S T I L T -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=I, 4=L, 5=T -> but position 4 must be N, not L -> invalid.

""STING"" is the only common word I can think of.

But there is also ""STIME"" but E is absent.

Or ""STIVY"" not common.

Perhaps ""STING"" is the best.

But we have to consider that the secret word might be ""STING"".

Alternatively, there might be other words like ""STYMY"" but not fitting.

Another: ""STINK"" is out.

""STINT"" is invalid because of T in position 5.

What about ""STING"" and if not, then we have other options.

But let's list all possible words that fit _ T I N _ and use available letters.

- STING: S T I N G
- Also, ""STYLI"" but that's 5 letters? S T Y L I -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=Y, 4=L, 5=I -> not matching, since position 3 should be I and 4 should be N.

No.

""STING"" seems to be the only common word.

But there is ""STIVE"" but E absent and no N.

Perhaps ""STING"" is the word.

But we must consider that position 1 could be other letters.

For example, ""UTICA"" not matching.

Another word: ""PTISAN"" is 6 letters.

I think ""STING"" is the most plausible.

But let's check the dictionary: other words? ""STILB"" not matching.

""STIRK"" -> S T I R K -> but R is absent -> invalid.

So, I think ""STING"" is the only reasonable guess.

Therefore, we will guess ""STING"".

But note: in ""STING"", the position 1 is S and position 5 is G.

If the secret word is ""STING"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on S and G.

But since we have few options, it's acceptable.

So, let's go with ""STING"".
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: 
  - C, R, A, E absent (x), N correct in position 4 (✓).  
  → **N is fixed at position 4**, and C/R/A/E are eliminated.
- **Guess 2 (point)**: 
  - P, O absent (x), I correct in position 3 (✓), N correct in position 4 (✓), T present but wrong position (-).  
  → **I is fixed at position 3**, P/O eliminated, and T is in the word but not in position 5.
- **Guess 3 (think)**: 
  - T present but wrong position (-), H absent (x), I correct in position 3 (✓), N correct in position 4 (✓), K absent (x).  
  → T is still misplaced (now confirmed **not in position 1**), H/K eliminated.

### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:
   - Position 3: **I**
   - Position 4: **N**
2. **T's position**: 
   - T cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from ""think"" and ""point"" feedback).  
   → **T must be in position 2**.  
   Thus, the word pattern is: `_ T I N _`.
3. **Absent letters (eliminated)**: C, R, A, E, P, O, H, K.  
   → Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Strategy for next guess**:
   - Must fit `_ T I N _` pattern with T in position 2.
   - Test new common letters (e.g., S, G) to resolve the remaining unknowns (positions 1 and 5).
   - Avoid eliminated letters and respect fixed positions.

### Why ""STING""?
- **STING** (S T I N G) fits the pattern `_ T I N _` perfectly:
  - Position 1: Tests **S** (common, untested letter).
  - Position 2: **T** (confirmed placement).
  - Position 3: **I** (fixed).
  - Position 4: **N** (fixed).
  - Position 5: Tests **G** (common, untested letter).
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on S and G will narrow possibilities (e.g., if S or G is absent, or if G is misplaced).

<guess>sting</guess>",sting,"We are on the fourth guess. Previous feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
Meaning: C, R, A, E are absent. N is in the word and in the correct position (4th).

Guess 2: ""point"" -> P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(-)
Meaning: P and O are absent. I is in the correct position (3rd). N is in the correct position (4th). T is present but in the wrong position.

Guess 3: ""think"" -> T(-), H(x), I(✓), N(✓), K(x)
Meaning: T is present but in the wrong position (again). H is absent. I is in the correct position (3rd). N is in the correct position (4th). K is absent.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. **Confirmed Positions**:
   - Position 3: I
   - Position 4: N

2. **Present Letters**:
   - T is in the word but not in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from ""think"": T was in position 1 and marked wrong, and from ""point"": T was in position 5 and marked wrong). Therefore, T must be in position 2.

   Why?
   - In ""point"", T was in position 5 and marked as present but wrong position, so T is not in position 5.
   - In ""think"", T was in position 1 and marked as present but wrong position, so T is not in position 1.
   - Positions 3 and 4 are fixed as I and N, so T cannot be there.
   - Therefore, the only position left for T is position 2.

   So, the secret word has T in position 2.

3. **Absent Letters**:
   - From all guesses: C, R, A, E, P, O, H, K are absent.
   - Also, we have used I and N, but they are already placed.

4. **Word Pattern**:
   - Position 1: unknown (but not T, and not any absent letter)
   - Position 2: T (now confirmed)
   - Position 3: I
   - Position 4: N
   - Position 5: unknown

   So the pattern is: _ T I N _

5. **Available Letters**:
   - We must avoid: C, R, A, E, P, O, H, K.
   - We have used: T, I, N (but T, I, N are in the word, so we can use them only if necessary, but I and N are fixed, and T is fixed in position 2. For position 1 and 5, we need new letters that are not absent and not already placed? But we don't know about duplicates. Since we haven't seen duplicates, we assume no duplicates for now. So position 1 and 5 should be letters not in {T, I, N} and not absent.

   Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   But we want to use common letters to maximize information.

6. **Constraints for Position 5**:
   - We don't know much, but we can form words ending with T, I, N? But the pattern is _ T I N _, so the last letter is after N.

Now, we need to form a word that fits the pattern _ T I N _ and uses available letters.

Possible words:

- STING: S T I N G -> S and G are available? S is available, G is available. But we haven't tested S and G.
- STINK: but K is absent -> invalid.
- STINT: S T I N T -> but T is repeated. We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, in position 5, T is present, but we know T is not in position 5 (from ""point"" feedback). So STINT would have T in position 5, which is invalid because T cannot be in position 5. Therefore, STINT is not allowed.

Other words:
- BEGIN: B E G I N -> but E is absent -> invalid.
- UTILE: U T I L E -> but E absent and pattern is U T I L E, which is positions 1=U, 2=T, 3=I, 4=L, 5=E -> but we need position 4 to be N, not L. So invalid.

We need the word to end with ""IN"" and then the fifth letter.

So: ? T I N ?

Examples:
- STING: S T I N G -> valid, and S and G are new.
- USING: U S I N G -> but position 2 is S, not T -> invalid. We need position 2 to be T.
- The word must have T in position 2.

So: 
- STING: S T I N G
- Also: ETUIN? Not a word.
- PTING? Not a word.
- FTING? Not a word.
- MTING? Not a word.

Another: ""STILL"" -> S T I L L -> but position 4 is L, not N -> invalid.

""STING"" is a good candidate.

Also, ""STINK"" is invalid because K is absent.

What about ""STUNS""? S T U N S -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=U, 4=N, 5=S -> but position 3 must be I, not U -> invalid.

We need position 3 to be I.

So only ""STING"" comes to mind.

Another: ""ATTAIN"" is 6 letters.

""SATIN"" has A and not N in position 4? S A T I N -> position 2 is A, but A is absent -> invalid.

""STIVE""? Not a word.

""STING"" seems to be the most common.

But let's check: is there ""STING"" in Wordle? Yes.

Another possibility: ""STIED""? Not a word and doesn't have N.

We can consider ""STING"" or perhaps ""STIMY"" (rare) or ""STIVY"" (rare).

But ""STING"" is common.

Also, ""STING"" uses S and G, which are common and we haven't tested.

If we guess ""STING"", we are testing S in position 1 and G in position 5.

If the word is ""STING"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on S and G.

But note: we have only two positions unknown: position 1 and 5.

And we know the word is _ T I N _

With available letters.

Other words that fit the pattern:

- BTING? Not a word.
- DTING? Not a word.
- GTING? Not a word.
- JTING? Not a word.
- LTING? Not a word.
- MTING? Not a word.
- QTING? Not a word.
- STING: valid.
- UTING? Not a word, but ""using"" doesn't have T in position 2.
- VTING? Not a word.
- WTING? Not a word.
- XTING? Not a word.
- YTING? Not a word.
- ZTING? Not a word.

What about ""STING"" and ""STINK"" (but K absent).

Another: ""STILT"" -> S T I L T -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=I, 4=L, 5=T -> but position 4 must be N, not L -> invalid.

""STING"" is the only common word I can think of.

But there is also ""STIME"" but E is absent.

Or ""STIVY"" not common.

Perhaps ""STING"" is the best.

But we have to consider that the secret word might be ""STING"".

Alternatively, there might be other words like ""STYMY"" but not fitting.

Another: ""STINK"" is out.

""STINT"" is invalid because of T in position 5.

What about ""STING"" and if not, then we have other options.

But let's list all possible words that fit _ T I N _ and use available letters.

- STING: S T I N G
- Also, ""STYLI"" but that's 5 letters? S T Y L I -> positions: 1=S, 2=T, 3=Y, 4=L, 5=I -> not matching, since position 3 should be I and 4 should be N.

No.

""STING"" seems to be the only common word.

But there is ""STIVE"" but E absent and no N.

Perhaps ""STING"" is the word.

But we must consider that position 1 could be other letters.

For example, ""UTICA"" not matching.

Another word: ""PTISAN"" is 6 letters.

I think ""STING"" is the most plausible.

But let's check the dictionary: other words? ""STILB"" not matching.

""STIRK"" -> S T I R K -> but R is absent -> invalid.

So, I think ""STING"" is the only reasonable guess.

Therefore, we will guess ""STING"".

But note: in ""STING"", the position 1 is S and position 5 is G.

If the secret word is ""STING"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on S and G.

But since we have few options, it's acceptable.

So, let's go with ""STING"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: 
  - C, R, A, E absent (x), N correct in position 4 (✓).  
  → **N is fixed at position 4**, and C/R/A/E are eliminated.
- **Guess 2 (point)**: 
  - P, O absent (x), I correct in position 3 (✓), N correct in position 4 (✓), T present but wrong position (-).  
  → **I is fixed at position 3**, P/O eliminated, and T is in the word but not in position 5.
- **Guess 3 (think)**: 
  - T present but wrong position (-), H absent (x), I correct in position 3 (✓), N correct in position 4 (✓), K absent (x).  
  → T is still misplaced (now confirmed **not in position 1**), H/K eliminated.

### Key Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:
   - Position 3: **I**
   - Position 4: **N**
2. **T's position**: 
   - T cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from ""think"" and ""point"" feedback).  
   → **T must be in position 2**.  
   Thus, the word pattern is: `_ T I N _`.
3. **Absent letters (eliminated)**: C, R, A, E, P, O, H, K.  
   → Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Strategy for next guess**:
   - Must fit `_ T I N _` pattern with T in position 2.
   - Test new common letters (e.g., S, G) to resolve the remaining unknowns (positions 1 and 5).
   - Avoid eliminated letters and respect fixed positions.

### Why ""STING""?
- **STING** (S T I N G) fits the pattern `_ T I N _` perfectly:
  - Position 1: Tests **S** (common, untested letter).
  - Position 2: **T** (confirmed placement).
  - Position 3: **I** (fixed).
  - Position 4: **N** (fixed).
  - Position 5: Tests **G** (common, untested letter).
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on S and G will narrow possibilities (e.g., if S or G is absent, or if G is misplaced).",Guess 4: sting -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓),SUCCESS
