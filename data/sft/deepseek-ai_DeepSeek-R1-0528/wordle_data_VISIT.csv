We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the properties:
 - We want to cover as many common letters as possible.
 - The word should have 5 distinct letters to maximize information.

 Some common letters in English: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning the accumulated results of investment) and is often used by Wordle bots because it has common letters.
 However, let me check if ""ROATE"" is valid. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also very common.

 But note: the game requires a valid 5-letter English word.

 Another popular one is ""CRANE"".

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has C, R, A, N, E: which are common letters.
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 So, I will start with ""CRANE"".

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", etc. So we are free to choose.

 Let me go with ""CRANE"".

 If the game accepts it, then we will get feedback and then adjust.

 Since this is the first guess, we don't have any constraints.

 Therefore, my first guess is: CRANE
</think>
I am starting the game and need to make my first guess. A strong opening word should maximize information by using common letters and a balanced mix of vowels and consonants. After considering options like ""SLATE"" and ""ROAST"", I chose **""CRANE""** because:  
- It contains 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E).  
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of useful feedback.  
- It covers frequently used letters in English 5-letter words.  

This will help me narrow down possibilities efficiently based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, x).

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

This is quite surprising because these are common letters, but it gives us valuable information: the secret word does not contain any of the letters C, R, A, N, or E.

We must now choose a second guess that uses none of these letters and consists of 5 new letters.

We need to pick a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word.

Common letters in English that are not in {C, R, A, N, E} include: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many of these as possible in one word.

Some good candidate words that avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E:

- ""SLOTH"": uses S, L, O, T, H -> all new letters.
- ""DUMPS"": uses D, U, M, P, S -> also new.
- ""LIGHT"": uses L, I, G, H, T.

But note: we want to maximize the information. We should try to include more common letters.

Another idea: ""OUIJA"" is a word but it has a 'J' which is less common. Also, it has two 'I's? Actually, ""OUIJA"" is 5 letters: O, U, I, J, A -> but A is already excluded. We cannot use A.

We must avoid A as well.

So, let's think of words without A, C, E, N, R.

Common words:

- ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> all common and not in the excluded set.
- ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S -> but U is less common than T? 
- ""GHOUL"": G, H, O, U, L -> U is less common.

""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it uses M, O, I, S, T which are all common.

Another one: ""BUILT"" -> B, U, I, L, T. But U is less common.

""SLIMY"": S, L, I, M, Y -> Y is also common.

But let's compare:

- ""MOIST"": letters M, O, I, S, T -> all very common.
- ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> but N is excluded! We cannot use N. So invalid.

We must avoid C, R, A, N, E. So N is excluded.

Therefore, ""POUND"" is invalid because it has N.

Similarly, ""HOUND"" has N and is invalid.

So, ""MOIST"" is valid: M, O, I, S, T.

Another candidate: ""LUCKY"" -> but C is excluded and also has U and Y.

""LUCKY"" has C -> invalid.

""STOMP"": S, T, O, M, P -> all good.

""STOMP"" vs ""MOIST"": both use 5 new letters. ""MOIST"" has I which is a vowel, while ""STOMP"" has no vowel? Actually, O is a vowel. Both have O.

But ""MOIST"" has two vowels (O and I) which might be better because words usually have vowels.

But the secret word must have vowels. Since A and E are excluded, the vowels left are I, O, U (and sometimes Y).

So having I and O is good.

We can also consider ""HOIST"": H, O, I, S, T -> similar to ""MOIST"" but with H instead of M.

H is less common than M? Actually, both are common.

But ""MOIST"" is a very common starting word in such games.

Another one: ""GUILT"": G, U, I, L, T -> has U and G.

I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.

But note: we are avoiding 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E. So we have 21 letters left.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So, I will go with ""MOIST"".

If we get feedback, we can then narrow down.

Therefore, the second guess is ""MOIST"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (all letters marked as ""x""), we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. This means we must avoid these letters entirely in our next guess. 

To maximize information, I'll choose a word that:
- Uses 5 new, common English letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}.
- Prioritizes high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, L, M) and vowels (e.g., O, I, U), since A and E are excluded.
- Avoids repeating letters to test more possibilities.

After evaluating options like ""SLOTH"" (too obscure), ""BUILT"" (includes less common ""U""), and ""POUND"" (invalid due to ""N""), I selected **""MOIST""** because:
- It uses 5 distinct, common letters: M, O, I, S, T.
- It covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T), increasing the chance of hits.
- It's a valid English word that adheres to the feedback constraints.

This guess will help identify which of these new letters are present and their positions, narrowing down the solution space efficiently.

But note: we are avoiding 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E. So we have 21 letters left.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So, I will go with ""MOIST"".

If we get feedback, we can then narrow down.

Therefore, the second guess is ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (all letters marked as ""x""), we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. This means we must avoid these letters entirely in our next guess. 

To maximize information, I'll choose a word that:
- Uses 5 new, common English letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}.
- Prioritizes high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, L, M) and vowels (e.g., O, I, U), since A and E are excluded.
- Avoids repeating letters to test more possibilities.

After evaluating options like ""SLOTH"" (too obscure), ""BUILT"" (includes less common ""U""), and ""POUND"" (invalid due to ""N""), I selected **""MOIST""** because:
- It uses 5 distinct, common letters: M, O, I, S, T.
- It covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T), increasing the chance of hits.
- It's a valid English word that adheres to the feedback constraints.

This guess will help identify which of these new letters are present and their positions, narrowing down the solution space efficiently.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess 1: CRANE -> all letters are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.
2. Guess 2: MOIST -> Feedback: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(-) T(✓)

Breaking down Guess 2:
- M is absent (x) -> M is not in the secret word.
- O is absent (x) -> O is not in the secret word.
- I is present but in the wrong position (-) -> The secret word contains I, but not in the third position.
- S is present but in the wrong position (-) -> The secret word contains S, but not in the fourth position.
- T is present and in the correct position (✓) -> The secret word has T in the fifth position.

So we know:
- The secret word ends with T (position 5).
- The secret word contains I and S, but not in the third and fourth positions respectively (since that's where we placed them).
- Additionally, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O.

Given that I and S must be in the word, but not at positions 3 and 4, we need to place them in other positions.

Also, note that T is fixed at position 5: _ _ _ _ T.

The word must be 5 letters, so the first three positions need filling, but note that I and S must appear somewhere in the first four positions (since fifth is T).

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 4? But position 4 is currently occupied by S in our guess, but in the secret, position 4 is not S. However, S could be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Similarly, I must be in position 1, 2, or 4? But position 3 we had I, but it's wrong, so I can't be at position 3. So I can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.

But position 4: we know the fifth is T, so position 4 must be a letter that is not S. But I could be at position 4? Yes, because we only know that I is not at position 3 and S is not at position 4.

We also know S is in the word, but not at position 4. S could be at positions 1, 2, or 3.

Similarly, I could be at positions 1, 2, or 4.

Now, we also must avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O.

So the available letters are the English alphabet excluding: A, C, E, M, N, O, R.

That leaves: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But from the feedback, we know the word contains I, S, and T (T is fixed at the end). So we have at least I, S, T.

Since T is fixed at the end, we have four other positions to fill.

We need to form a word that has T at the end, includes I and S, and avoids the excluded letters.

Now, current known positions: T is at position 5.

We need to assign I and S to other positions (not 3 for I, not 4 for S) and fill the remaining two letters.

Our next guess should aim to:
- Test possible positions for I and S.
- Test new letters for the remaining positions to gather more information.

We know:
- Position 5: T (fixed)
- The word has I and S.

Possible structure: let the word be [P1][P2][P3][P4] T

Constraints:
- P3 cannot be I (because guess 2 had I at position 3 and it was wrong)
- P4 cannot be S (because guess 2 had S at position 4 and it was wrong, meaning S is elsewhere)

So I must be in P1, P2, or P4? But P4 is the fourth position. If I is at P4, that is acceptable since we only know it can't be at P3.

Similarly, S must be in P1, P2, or P3? Because P4 cannot be S? Actually, we placed S at P4 in guess 2 and it was marked wrong (wrong position), meaning S is not at P4, so S must be at P1, P2, or P3.

But P3: we don't know yet.

So:
- S in {P1, P2, P3}
- I in {P1, P2, P4}  (because P3 is forbidden for I)

Now, we also note that the same letter might not be repeated? We don't know about duplicates yet, but since we have no feedback suggesting duplicates and we want to maximize information, it's safer to avoid duplicates for now.

We need to choose a word that fits these constraints.

Moreover, we need to test new letters to rule out more possibilities.

We have excluded 7 letters: A, C, E, M, N, O, R. So we can use the remaining.

Good candidates might include common letters like L, H, P, U, etc.

Let's brainstorm some words that end with T and contain I and S.

Examples:
- EXIST? But E and X not used? But E is excluded, and we don't know about X but let's think. Also, E is excluded, so not EXIST.
- PULSIT? Not a word.
- SHIFT: H is allowed? S at position 1? But S at P1 -> then I at P4? SHIFT: S H I F T -> that would be S at P1, H at P2, I at P3? But in our guess, I at P3 was wrong? In guess 2, we placed I at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position. So if we try SHIFT, I is at position 3 again? Same position? So if I is not at position 3 in the secret, then SHIFT would be invalid? Not necessarily: the symbol ""-"" for I in MOIST means I is in the word but not at the guessed position (position 3). Therefore, in SHIFT, if we put I at position 3, that would not be allowed because we already know I cannot be at position 3? Exactly. Therefore, we must not put I at position 3 again.

Similarly, we cannot put S at position 4 again.

Therefore, SHIFT has I at position 3, which is forbidden? So we cannot use a word with I at position 3 or S at position 4. Hence, SHIFT is invalid because I is at position 3.

Similarly, other words.

What about POSIT? P O S I T -> but O is excluded? Yes, O is excluded from guess 2. So not allowed.

So list of words ending with T, containing S and I, and without the excluded letters.

Without: A, C, E, M, N, O, R.

And S not at position 4, I not at position 3.

So S can be at 1,2,3 and I at 1,2,4.

Possible words:
- S at P1, I at P2: e.g., S L I T T? But T at end, wait. S L I T? No, that's 4 letters. S something I something T. S L I P T? Slip is 4 letters. SLIPT not common, but you might say SLIPT (archaic past of slip). But let's find standard words.
- S at P1, I at P4: word S _ _ I T
  - e.g., SPIT: but that would be S P I T -> 4 letters? SPIT is 4 letters. We need 5: SPIT is 4 letters? No. S P I T is 4. So 5-letter words: 
    - SQUIT? Not a word.
    - SHIRT? But H is allowed, but R is excluded? R is excluded. So SHIRT has R -> invalid.
    - SHIST? Not common -> let's skip.
    - SMIFT? Not a word.
    - SUIT? 4 letters.

  Instead, maybe: S L I T T? But duplicate T? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. T is already at position 5, so if we have T at position 2, it might be duplicate? The secret word might have duplicate letters? Possible, but we haven't encountered duplicates yet.

  Since in the feedback for ""MOIST"", we had T correct at position 5, and S and I as wrong position, but if there were duplicate T, we don't know. But to be safe, we assume no duplicates for now.

  So back: S _ _ I T -> what words? For example:
    - SPIRIT? But that's 6 letters.
    - SPLIT: S P L I T -> that's 5 letters? S P L I T: positions: P1=S, P2=P, P3=L, P4=I, P5=T? But wait, then I is at position 4, which is allowed (since I can be at P4). And we placed S at P1 and I at P4? And T at P5? So that seems valid.

  But does SPLIT have I at position 4? Yes.

  Also, SPLIT: letters S, P, L, I, T -> all acceptable? S, P, L, I, T: no excluded letter? Excluded are A,C,E,M,N,O,R -> so P and L are allowed.

  So ""SPLIT"" is a candidate.

- Another possibility: S at P2, I at P1? For example, I S something T. But I at P1, S at P2: I S _ _ T

  e.g., ISSUE? But not T at end.
  - ISLET? But E is excluded -> invalid.
  - ISTLE? Not standard.
  - Input: I S L E T -> E excluded.
  I S T L E -> no, E at end? But we need T at end? I S something T? I S _ _ T? For example:
    - ISOLT? -> O excluded.
    - ISPUT? Not a word.
    - Hard to find. Skip.

- S at P2, I at P4: word _ S _ I T
  - e.g., USUIT? Not a word.
  - P S Y C H I T? No.
  - More: 
    - ESILE? E excluded.
    - MUSIT? Not common.

- S at P2, I at P1? No, that's covered above.

Another structure: S at P3, I at P1: word I _ S _ T
- e.g., I P S E D -> not ending T? I mean, I ? S ? T -> positions: P1=I, P2=?, P3=S, P4=?, P5=T.
- Example: LIST: 4 letters -> L I S T, but 4. 5-letter: e.g., IGOS T? O excluded.
- Words: I B S O T -> O excluded.
- I L S E T -> E excluded.

Perhaps I at P1, S at P2: I S ? ? T -> as before, hard.

S at P3, I at P2: word _ I S _ T
- e.g., B I S K T? But K allowed? BISKT not word -> BISK is 4 letters.
- F I S H T? FISHT not standard word.
- D I S T Y? But ending Y? T at end? No.

S at P3, I at P4: word _ _ S I T
- e.g., D E S I T -> E excluded.
- V I S I T -> V I S I T -> but I appears twice? And V, I, S, I, T. But we have I at positions 2 and 4? But the secret might have duplicates? Also, position 4 is I, which is allowed, and S at position 3 -> S at position 3 might be allowed? In guess 2 we had S at position 4? Here S at position 3 is different.

But VISIT: letters V, I, S, I, T -> contains I twice? The feedback might get complicated. Moreover, we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

To keep it simple, avoid potential duplicates.

We had a candidate: SPLIT (S P L I T).

In SPLIT:
- S is at position 1 -> we don't know if S can be at P1? We haven't tested it? We know S is not at P4, but it could be at P1, P2, or P3. So P1 is fine.
- I is at position 4 -> similarly, I can be at positions 1,2,4, and we haven't tested P4 for I? In guess 2, I was at P3, so P4 is fresh.
- P3 is L, which we haven't tested? Yes, new letter.

Also, P2 is P.

So ""SPLIT"" seems a good test because:
- It uses new letters P and L.
- It places S at P1 and I at P4, which are untested positions so far.
- It ends with T as required.

Additionally, it adheres to feedback constraints.

However, note that in SPLIT, position 3 is L. What if the secret word has S at position 3? Then we might not test that? But in this guess, we are putting S at position 1, which might be incorrect.

Another possibility: We could test a word that puts S at position 3? But we don't have I at position 3? We need both S and I.

If we put S at position 3? Then I would go to position 1 or 2 or 4.

Say S at P3, and I at P1: word I ? S ? T

But we might not have many choices? Earlier I couldn't find.

What about words with I at P2 and S at P3? For example, ? I S ? T
- e.g., FIST: 4 letters -> F I S T. Not 5.
- LIST: L I S T -> 4.
- MUSTY? Not ending T? M U S T Y -> ending Y? Not T.
- DISTY? D I S T Y -> ending T? No.
- WISPY? W I S P Y -> not T ending.
- HUSKY? Not.

Another common pattern: U S ? I T? But U is available.

Word: SUITE? But E is excluded -> SUITE ends with E? No, SUITE is S U I T E? That's 5? S U I T E -> positions: S at 1, U at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5 -> but E is excluded and also T is not at end? We need T at position 5? In SUITE, T is at position 4? So not.

Perhaps words like: LUSIT? Not word.

Alternative words: FOCUS? Not ending T.

Perhaps ""SPILT"": same as SPLIT? Spilt is a variant of spill? Acceptable.

But I think SPLIT is a standard word.

Another candidate: SHITS? But has S at end? T at position 5? SHI T S -> S at position 5, but we need position 5 as T? So no? S H I T S? Then T at position 4? Not end.

Not.

""TIBIA""? But T at start? But position 5 is T? TIBIA has T at start and end? T I B I A -> not T at position 5? Position 5 is A? A excluded.

No.

Maybe ""SPITZ""? S P I T Z -> T at position 4? Not end.

Not.

So SPLIT seems good.

But we can think of other words: 
- Using U: B U S H I T -> not.
- P U S S Y -> not ending T.

Another idea: ""QUIST""? Not common, and Q might be rare.

""SPLIT"" is acceptable.

In SPLIT, we are testing:
- S at position 1: if ✓ then S is correct, if - then S is elsewhere, etc.
- Similarly for other letters.

But also note: position 2 is P, which is new.

After this guess, we may be able to narrow down.

However, there is another word: we could test a word that places S at position 3? For example, if we choose ""QUITS"": Q U I T S -> positions: P1=Q, P2=U, P3=I? But I at position 3? But I cannot be at position 3 because of feedback! In guess 2, I at position 3 was wrong. So we must avoid putting I at position 3.

Therefore, ""QUITS"" has I at position 3, which is not allowed -> invalid.

Similarly, avoid I at position 3.

Therefore, let's go with SPLIT.

But note: another possibility is S at position 2? I at position 1? For example, I S L E T -> E excluded.

I S S U T? Not standard.

Perhaps ""DITSY"": D I T S Y -> but T at position 3? Not end? and no S at end? D I T S Y -> T at P3, S at P4? But we need T at P5? Not.

I S L E D? Not T.

Hard? So SPLIT seems a solid choice.

We might also consider ""SWIFT"": S W I F T -> that's 5 letters? S at 1, W at 2, I at 3, F at 4, T at 5? But I at position 3? We cannot put I at position 3. So invalid.

Similarly, ""SHIFT"" has I at P3 -> invalid.

Therefore, we choose ""SPLIT"".

Let me confirm constraints:
- Letters used: S, P, L, I, T -> T is known to be in word? Yes, at P5. S and I are known to be in word. P and L are new? Yes?
- But L is new? Yes.

In guess 2, we used M, O, I, S, T -> so L and P are new, so we test them.

If the feedback on S and I can give their positions.

So next guess: SPLIT.

But note: the word might have more than one of I or S? But since we are putting I only at P4 and S at P1, and others new? If there is duplicate, the feedback might show? We'll see.

Therefore, I will guess ""SPLIT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **CRANE** all letters absent: Eliminates C, R, A, N, E. Secret word has none of these.
- **MOIST** feedback: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(-) T(✓) reveals:
  - **T must be in position 5**: Secret word ends with T.
  - **I is present but not in position 3**.
  - **S is present but not in position 4**.
  - **M and O are absent**, eliminating them.
- Excluded letters so far: A, C, E, M, N, O, R.

For this guess, I prioritize:
1. Ending with **T** (position 5) to maintain the known correct placement.
2. Including **I and S**, but avoiding position 3 for I and position 4 for S.
3. Testing new common letters to gather more information (choosing unused consonants like P and L).
4. Avoiding duplicates and excluded letters.

Selected **""SPLIT""** because:
- Starts with **S** (tests position 1 for S, since it can't be in position 4 but could be in 1, 2, or 3).
- Places **I in position 4** (a new, untested position allowed by feedback).
- Uses new letters **P** (position 2) and **L** (position 3) to probe for inclusion/position.
- Follows all constraints: no I in position 3, no S in position 4, no excluded letters.

<guess>SPLIT</guess>",SPLIT,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess 1: CRANE -> all letters are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.
2. Guess 2: MOIST -> Feedback: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(-) T(✓)

Breaking down Guess 2:
- M is absent (x) -> M is not in the secret word.
- O is absent (x) -> O is not in the secret word.
- I is present but in the wrong position (-) -> The secret word contains I, but not in the third position.
- S is present but in the wrong position (-) -> The secret word contains S, but not in the fourth position.
- T is present and in the correct position (✓) -> The secret word has T in the fifth position.

So we know:
- The secret word ends with T (position 5).
- The secret word contains I and S, but not in the third and fourth positions respectively (since that's where we placed them).
- Additionally, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O.

Given that I and S must be in the word, but not at positions 3 and 4, we need to place them in other positions.

Also, note that T is fixed at position 5: _ _ _ _ T.

The word must be 5 letters, so the first three positions need filling, but note that I and S must appear somewhere in the first four positions (since fifth is T).

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 4? But position 4 is currently occupied by S in our guess, but in the secret, position 4 is not S. However, S could be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Similarly, I must be in position 1, 2, or 4? But position 3 we had I, but it's wrong, so I can't be at position 3. So I can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.

But position 4: we know the fifth is T, so position 4 must be a letter that is not S. But I could be at position 4? Yes, because we only know that I is not at position 3 and S is not at position 4.

We also know S is in the word, but not at position 4. S could be at positions 1, 2, or 3.

Similarly, I could be at positions 1, 2, or 4.

Now, we also must avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O.

So the available letters are the English alphabet excluding: A, C, E, M, N, O, R.

That leaves: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But from the feedback, we know the word contains I, S, and T (T is fixed at the end). So we have at least I, S, T.

Since T is fixed at the end, we have four other positions to fill.

We need to form a word that has T at the end, includes I and S, and avoids the excluded letters.

Now, current known positions: T is at position 5.

We need to assign I and S to other positions (not 3 for I, not 4 for S) and fill the remaining two letters.

Our next guess should aim to:
- Test possible positions for I and S.
- Test new letters for the remaining positions to gather more information.

We know:
- Position 5: T (fixed)
- The word has I and S.

Possible structure: let the word be [P1][P2][P3][P4] T

Constraints:
- P3 cannot be I (because guess 2 had I at position 3 and it was wrong)
- P4 cannot be S (because guess 2 had S at position 4 and it was wrong, meaning S is elsewhere)

So I must be in P1, P2, or P4? But P4 is the fourth position. If I is at P4, that is acceptable since we only know it can't be at P3.

Similarly, S must be in P1, P2, or P3? Because P4 cannot be S? Actually, we placed S at P4 in guess 2 and it was marked wrong (wrong position), meaning S is not at P4, so S must be at P1, P2, or P3.

But P3: we don't know yet.

So:
- S in {P1, P2, P3}
- I in {P1, P2, P4}  (because P3 is forbidden for I)

Now, we also note that the same letter might not be repeated? We don't know about duplicates yet, but since we have no feedback suggesting duplicates and we want to maximize information, it's safer to avoid duplicates for now.

We need to choose a word that fits these constraints.

Moreover, we need to test new letters to rule out more possibilities.

We have excluded 7 letters: A, C, E, M, N, O, R. So we can use the remaining.

Good candidates might include common letters like L, H, P, U, etc.

Let's brainstorm some words that end with T and contain I and S.

Examples:
- EXIST? But E and X not used? But E is excluded, and we don't know about X but let's think. Also, E is excluded, so not EXIST.
- PULSIT? Not a word.
- SHIFT: H is allowed? S at position 1? But S at P1 -> then I at P4? SHIFT: S H I F T -> that would be S at P1, H at P2, I at P3? But in our guess, I at P3 was wrong? In guess 2, we placed I at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position. So if we try SHIFT, I is at position 3 again? Same position? So if I is not at position 3 in the secret, then SHIFT would be invalid? Not necessarily: the symbol ""-"" for I in MOIST means I is in the word but not at the guessed position (position 3). Therefore, in SHIFT, if we put I at position 3, that would not be allowed because we already know I cannot be at position 3? Exactly. Therefore, we must not put I at position 3 again.

Similarly, we cannot put S at position 4 again.

Therefore, SHIFT has I at position 3, which is forbidden? So we cannot use a word with I at position 3 or S at position 4. Hence, SHIFT is invalid because I is at position 3.

Similarly, other words.

What about POSIT? P O S I T -> but O is excluded? Yes, O is excluded from guess 2. So not allowed.

So list of words ending with T, containing S and I, and without the excluded letters.

Without: A, C, E, M, N, O, R.

And S not at position 4, I not at position 3.

So S can be at 1,2,3 and I at 1,2,4.

Possible words:
- S at P1, I at P2: e.g., S L I T T? But T at end, wait. S L I T? No, that's 4 letters. S something I something T. S L I P T? Slip is 4 letters. SLIPT not common, but you might say SLIPT (archaic past of slip). But let's find standard words.
- S at P1, I at P4: word S _ _ I T
  - e.g., SPIT: but that would be S P I T -> 4 letters? SPIT is 4 letters. We need 5: SPIT is 4 letters? No. S P I T is 4. So 5-letter words: 
    - SQUIT? Not a word.
    - SHIRT? But H is allowed, but R is excluded? R is excluded. So SHIRT has R -> invalid.
    - SHIST? Not common -> let's skip.
    - SMIFT? Not a word.
    - SUIT? 4 letters.

  Instead, maybe: S L I T T? But duplicate T? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. T is already at position 5, so if we have T at position 2, it might be duplicate? The secret word might have duplicate letters? Possible, but we haven't encountered duplicates yet.

  Since in the feedback for ""MOIST"", we had T correct at position 5, and S and I as wrong position, but if there were duplicate T, we don't know. But to be safe, we assume no duplicates for now.

  So back: S _ _ I T -> what words? For example:
    - SPIRIT? But that's 6 letters.
    - SPLIT: S P L I T -> that's 5 letters? S P L I T: positions: P1=S, P2=P, P3=L, P4=I, P5=T? But wait, then I is at position 4, which is allowed (since I can be at P4). And we placed S at P1 and I at P4? And T at P5? So that seems valid.

  But does SPLIT have I at position 4? Yes.

  Also, SPLIT: letters S, P, L, I, T -> all acceptable? S, P, L, I, T: no excluded letter? Excluded are A,C,E,M,N,O,R -> so P and L are allowed.

  So ""SPLIT"" is a candidate.

- Another possibility: S at P2, I at P1? For example, I S something T. But I at P1, S at P2: I S _ _ T

  e.g., ISSUE? But not T at end.
  - ISLET? But E is excluded -> invalid.
  - ISTLE? Not standard.
  - Input: I S L E T -> E excluded.
  I S T L E -> no, E at end? But we need T at end? I S something T? I S _ _ T? For example:
    - ISOLT? -> O excluded.
    - ISPUT? Not a word.
    - Hard to find. Skip.

- S at P2, I at P4: word _ S _ I T
  - e.g., USUIT? Not a word.
  - P S Y C H I T? No.
  - More: 
    - ESILE? E excluded.
    - MUSIT? Not common.

- S at P2, I at P1? No, that's covered above.

Another structure: S at P3, I at P1: word I _ S _ T
- e.g., I P S E D -> not ending T? I mean, I ? S ? T -> positions: P1=I, P2=?, P3=S, P4=?, P5=T.
- Example: LIST: 4 letters -> L I S T, but 4. 5-letter: e.g., IGOS T? O excluded.
- Words: I B S O T -> O excluded.
- I L S E T -> E excluded.

Perhaps I at P1, S at P2: I S ? ? T -> as before, hard.

S at P3, I at P2: word _ I S _ T
- e.g., B I S K T? But K allowed? BISKT not word -> BISK is 4 letters.
- F I S H T? FISHT not standard word.
- D I S T Y? But ending Y? T at end? No.

S at P3, I at P4: word _ _ S I T
- e.g., D E S I T -> E excluded.
- V I S I T -> V I S I T -> but I appears twice? And V, I, S, I, T. But we have I at positions 2 and 4? But the secret might have duplicates? Also, position 4 is I, which is allowed, and S at position 3 -> S at position 3 might be allowed? In guess 2 we had S at position 4? Here S at position 3 is different.

But VISIT: letters V, I, S, I, T -> contains I twice? The feedback might get complicated. Moreover, we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

To keep it simple, avoid potential duplicates.

We had a candidate: SPLIT (S P L I T).

In SPLIT:
- S is at position 1 -> we don't know if S can be at P1? We haven't tested it? We know S is not at P4, but it could be at P1, P2, or P3. So P1 is fine.
- I is at position 4 -> similarly, I can be at positions 1,2,4, and we haven't tested P4 for I? In guess 2, I was at P3, so P4 is fresh.
- P3 is L, which we haven't tested? Yes, new letter.

Also, P2 is P.

So ""SPLIT"" seems a good test because:
- It uses new letters P and L.
- It places S at P1 and I at P4, which are untested positions so far.
- It ends with T as required.

Additionally, it adheres to feedback constraints.

However, note that in SPLIT, position 3 is L. What if the secret word has S at position 3? Then we might not test that? But in this guess, we are putting S at position 1, which might be incorrect.

Another possibility: We could test a word that puts S at position 3? But we don't have I at position 3? We need both S and I.

If we put S at position 3? Then I would go to position 1 or 2 or 4.

Say S at P3, and I at P1: word I ? S ? T

But we might not have many choices? Earlier I couldn't find.

What about words with I at P2 and S at P3? For example, ? I S ? T
- e.g., FIST: 4 letters -> F I S T. Not 5.
- LIST: L I S T -> 4.
- MUSTY? Not ending T? M U S T Y -> ending Y? Not T.
- DISTY? D I S T Y -> ending T? No.
- WISPY? W I S P Y -> not T ending.
- HUSKY? Not.

Another common pattern: U S ? I T? But U is available.

Word: SUITE? But E is excluded -> SUITE ends with E? No, SUITE is S U I T E? That's 5? S U I T E -> positions: S at 1, U at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5 -> but E is excluded and also T is not at end? We need T at position 5? In SUITE, T is at position 4? So not.

Perhaps words like: LUSIT? Not word.

Alternative words: FOCUS? Not ending T.

Perhaps ""SPILT"": same as SPLIT? Spilt is a variant of spill? Acceptable.

But I think SPLIT is a standard word.

Another candidate: SHITS? But has S at end? T at position 5? SHI T S -> S at position 5, but we need position 5 as T? So no? S H I T S? Then T at position 4? Not end.

Not.

""TIBIA""? But T at start? But position 5 is T? TIBIA has T at start and end? T I B I A -> not T at position 5? Position 5 is A? A excluded.

No.

Maybe ""SPITZ""? S P I T Z -> T at position 4? Not end.

Not.

So SPLIT seems good.

But we can think of other words: 
- Using U: B U S H I T -> not.
- P U S S Y -> not ending T.

Another idea: ""QUIST""? Not common, and Q might be rare.

""SPLIT"" is acceptable.

In SPLIT, we are testing:
- S at position 1: if ✓ then S is correct, if - then S is elsewhere, etc.
- Similarly for other letters.

But also note: position 2 is P, which is new.

After this guess, we may be able to narrow down.

However, there is another word: we could test a word that places S at position 3? For example, if we choose ""QUITS"": Q U I T S -> positions: P1=Q, P2=U, P3=I? But I at position 3? But I cannot be at position 3 because of feedback! In guess 2, I at position 3 was wrong. So we must avoid putting I at position 3.

Therefore, ""QUITS"" has I at position 3, which is not allowed -> invalid.

Similarly, avoid I at position 3.

Therefore, let's go with SPLIT.

But note: another possibility is S at position 2? I at position 1? For example, I S L E T -> E excluded.

I S S U T? Not standard.

Perhaps ""DITSY"": D I T S Y -> but T at position 3? Not end? and no S at end? D I T S Y -> T at P3, S at P4? But we need T at P5? Not.

I S L E D? Not T.

Hard? So SPLIT seems a solid choice.

We might also consider ""SWIFT"": S W I F T -> that's 5 letters? S at 1, W at 2, I at 3, F at 4, T at 5? But I at position 3? We cannot put I at position 3. So invalid.

Similarly, ""SHIFT"" has I at P3 -> invalid.

Therefore, we choose ""SPLIT"".

Let me confirm constraints:
- Letters used: S, P, L, I, T -> T is known to be in word? Yes, at P5. S and I are known to be in word. P and L are new? Yes?
- But L is new? Yes.

In guess 2, we used M, O, I, S, T -> so L and P are new, so we test them.

If the feedback on S and I can give their positions.

So next guess: SPLIT.

But note: the word might have more than one of I or S? But since we are putting I only at P4 and S at P1, and others new? If there is duplicate, the feedback might show? We'll see.

Therefore, I will guess ""SPLIT"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **CRANE** all letters absent: Eliminates C, R, A, N, E. Secret word has none of these.
- **MOIST** feedback: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(-) T(✓) reveals:
  - **T must be in position 5**: Secret word ends with T.
  - **I is present but not in position 3**.
  - **S is present but not in position 4**.
  - **M and O are absent**, eliminating them.
- Excluded letters so far: A, C, E, M, N, O, R.

For this guess, I prioritize:
1. Ending with **T** (position 5) to maintain the known correct placement.
2. Including **I and S**, but avoiding position 3 for I and position 4 for S.
3. Testing new common letters to gather more information (choosing unused consonants like P and L).
4. Avoiding duplicates and excluded letters.

Selected **""SPLIT""** because:
- Starts with **S** (tests position 1 for S, since it can't be in position 4 but could be in 1, 2, or 3).
- Places **I in position 4** (a new, untested position allowed by feedback).
- Uses new letters **P** (position 2) and **L** (position 3) to probe for inclusion/position.
- Follows all constraints: no I in position 3, no S in position 4, no excluded letters.",Guess 3: SPLIT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) L(x) I(✓) T(✓),FAIL

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think about the properties:
 - We want to cover as many common letters as possible.
 - The word should have 5 distinct letters to maximize information.

 Some common letters in English: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning the accumulated results of investment) and is often used by Wordle bots because it has common letters.
 However, let me check if ""ROATE"" is valid. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also very common.

 But note: the game requires a valid 5-letter English word.

 Another popular one is ""CRANE"".

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has C, R, A, N, E: which are common letters.
   - It includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

 So, I will start with ""CRANE"".

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", etc. So we are free to choose.

 Let me go with ""CRANE"".

 If the game accepts it, then we will get feedback and then adjust.

 Since this is the first guess, we don't have any constraints.

 Therefore, my first guess is: CRANEI am starting the game and need to make my first guess. A strong opening word should maximize information by using common letters and a balanced mix of vowels and consonants. After considering options like ""SLATE"" and ""ROAST"", I chose **""CRANE""** because:  
- It contains 3 common consonants (C, R, N) and 2 vowels (A, E).  
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of useful feedback.  
- It covers frequently used letters in English 5-letter words.  

This will help me narrow down possibilities efficiently based on the feedback symbols (✓, -, x).

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

This is quite surprising because these are common letters, but it gives us valuable information: the secret word does not contain any of the letters C, R, A, N, or E.

We must now choose a second guess that uses none of these letters and consists of 5 new letters.

We need to pick a word that uses other common letters to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word.

Common letters in English that are not in {C, R, A, N, E} include: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many of these as possible in one word.

Some good candidate words that avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E:

- ""SLOTH"": uses S, L, O, T, H -> all new letters.
- ""DUMPS"": uses D, U, M, P, S -> also new.
- ""LIGHT"": uses L, I, G, H, T.

But note: we want to maximize the information. We should try to include more common letters.

Another idea: ""OUIJA"" is a word but it has a 'J' which is less common. Also, it has two 'I's? Actually, ""OUIJA"" is 5 letters: O, U, I, J, A -> but A is already excluded. We cannot use A.

We must avoid A as well.

So, let's think of words without A, C, E, N, R.

Common words:

- ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> all common and not in the excluded set.
- ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S -> but U is less common than T? 
- ""GHOUL"": G, H, O, U, L -> U is less common.

""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it uses M, O, I, S, T which are all common.

Another one: ""BUILT"" -> B, U, I, L, T. But U is less common.

""SLIMY"": S, L, I, M, Y -> Y is also common.

But let's compare:

- ""MOIST"": letters M, O, I, S, T -> all very common.
- ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> but N is excluded! We cannot use N. So invalid.

We must avoid C, R, A, N, E. So N is excluded.

Therefore, ""POUND"" is invalid because it has N.

Similarly, ""HOUND"" has N and is invalid.

So, ""MOIST"" is valid: M, O, I, S, T.

Another candidate: ""LUCKY"" -> but C is excluded and also has U and Y.

""LUCKY"" has C -> invalid.

""STOMP"": S, T, O, M, P -> all good.

""STOMP"" vs ""MOIST"": both use 5 new letters. ""MOIST"" has I which is a vowel, while ""STOMP"" has no vowel? Actually, O is a vowel. Both have O.

But ""MOIST"" has two vowels (O and I) which might be better because words usually have vowels.

But the secret word must have vowels. Since A and E are excluded, the vowels left are I, O, U (and sometimes Y).

So having I and O is good.

We can also consider ""HOIST"": H, O, I, S, T -> similar to ""MOIST"" but with H instead of M.

H is less common than M? Actually, both are common.

But ""MOIST"" is a very common starting word in such games.

Another one: ""GUILT"": G, U, I, L, T -> has U and G.

I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.

But note: we are avoiding 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E. So we have 21 letters left.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So, I will go with ""MOIST"".

If we get feedback, we can then narrow down.

Therefore, the second guess is ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"" (all letters marked as ""x""), we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. This means we must avoid these letters entirely in our next guess. 

To maximize information, I'll choose a word that:
- Uses 5 new, common English letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}.
- Prioritizes high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, L, M) and vowels (e.g., O, I, U), since A and E are excluded.
- Avoids repeating letters to test more possibilities.

After evaluating options like ""SLOTH"" (too obscure), ""BUILT"" (includes less common ""U""), and ""POUND"" (invalid due to ""N""), I selected **""MOIST""** because:
- It uses 5 distinct, common letters: M, O, I, S, T.
- It covers two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T), increasing the chance of hits.
- It's a valid English word that adheres to the feedback constraints.

This guess will help identify which of these new letters are present and their positions, narrowing down the solution space efficiently.

<guess>MOIST</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(-) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess 1: CRANE -> all letters are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.
2. Guess 2: MOIST -> Feedback: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(-) T(✓)

Breaking down Guess 2:
- M is absent (x) -> M is not in the secret word.
- O is absent (x) -> O is not in the secret word.
- I is present but in the wrong position (-) -> The secret word contains I, but not in the third position.
- S is present but in the wrong position (-) -> The secret word contains S, but not in the fourth position.
- T is present and in the correct position (✓) -> The secret word has T in the fifth position.

So we know:
- The secret word ends with T (position 5).
- The secret word contains I and S, but not in the third and fourth positions respectively (since that's where we placed them).
- Additionally, the absent letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O.

Given that I and S must be in the word, but not at positions 3 and 4, we need to place them in other positions.

Also, note that T is fixed at position 5: _ _ _ _ T.

The word must be 5 letters, so the first three positions need filling, but note that I and S must appear somewhere in the first four positions (since fifth is T).

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 4? But position 4 is currently occupied by S in our guess, but in the secret, position 4 is not S. However, S could be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Similarly, I must be in position 1, 2, or 4? But position 3 we had I, but it's wrong, so I can't be at position 3. So I can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.

But position 4: we know the fifth is T, so position 4 must be a letter that is not S. But I could be at position 4? Yes, because we only know that I is not at position 3 and S is not at position 4.

We also know S is in the word, but not at position 4. S could be at positions 1, 2, or 3.

Similarly, I could be at positions 1, 2, or 4.

Now, we also must avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O.

So the available letters are the English alphabet excluding: A, C, E, M, N, O, R.

That leaves: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But from the feedback, we know the word contains I, S, and T (T is fixed at the end). So we have at least I, S, T.

Since T is fixed at the end, we have four other positions to fill.

We need to form a word that has T at the end, includes I and S, and avoids the excluded letters.

Now, current known positions: T is at position 5.

We need to assign I and S to other positions (not 3 for I, not 4 for S) and fill the remaining two letters.

Our next guess should aim to:
- Test possible positions for I and S.
- Test new letters for the remaining positions to gather more information.

We know:
- Position 5: T (fixed)
- The word has I and S.

Possible structure: let the word be [P1][P2][P3][P4] T

Constraints:
- P3 cannot be I (because guess 2 had I at position 3 and it was wrong)
- P4 cannot be S (because guess 2 had S at position 4 and it was wrong, meaning S is elsewhere)

So I must be in P1, P2, or P4? But P4 is the fourth position. If I is at P4, that is acceptable since we only know it can't be at P3.

Similarly, S must be in P1, P2, or P3? Because P4 cannot be S? Actually, we placed S at P4 in guess 2 and it was marked wrong (wrong position), meaning S is not at P4, so S must be at P1, P2, or P3.

But P3: we don't know yet.

So:
- S in {P1, P2, P3}
- I in {P1, P2, P4}  (because P3 is forbidden for I)

Now, we also note that the same letter might not be repeated? We don't know about duplicates yet, but since we have no feedback suggesting duplicates and we want to maximize information, it's safer to avoid duplicates for now.

We need to choose a word that fits these constraints.

Moreover, we need to test new letters to rule out more possibilities.

We have excluded 7 letters: A, C, E, M, N, O, R. So we can use the remaining.

Good candidates might include common letters like L, H, P, U, etc.

Let's brainstorm some words that end with T and contain I and S.

Examples:
- EXIST? But E and X not used? But E is excluded, and we don't know about X but let's think. Also, E is excluded, so not EXIST.
- PULSIT? Not a word.
- SHIFT: H is allowed? S at position 1? But S at P1 -> then I at P4? SHIFT: S H I F T -> that would be S at P1, H at P2, I at P3? But in our guess, I at P3 was wrong? In guess 2, we placed I at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position. So if we try SHIFT, I is at position 3 again? Same position? So if I is not at position 3 in the secret, then SHIFT would be invalid? Not necessarily: the symbol ""-"" for I in MOIST means I is in the word but not at the guessed position (position 3). Therefore, in SHIFT, if we put I at position 3, that would not be allowed because we already know I cannot be at position 3? Exactly. Therefore, we must not put I at position 3 again.

Similarly, we cannot put S at position 4 again.

Therefore, SHIFT has I at position 3, which is forbidden? So we cannot use a word with I at position 3 or S at position 4. Hence, SHIFT is invalid because I is at position 3.

Similarly, other words.

What about POSIT? P O S I T -> but O is excluded? Yes, O is excluded from guess 2. So not allowed.

So list of words ending with T, containing S and I, and without the excluded letters.

Without: A, C, E, M, N, O, R.

And S not at position 4, I not at position 3.

So S can be at 1,2,3 and I at 1,2,4.

Possible words:
- S at P1, I at P2: e.g., S L I T T? But T at end, wait. S L I T? No, that's 4 letters. S something I something T. S L I P T? Slip is 4 letters. SLIPT not common, but you might say SLIPT (archaic past of slip). But let's find standard words.
- S at P1, I at P4: word S _ _ I T
  - e.g., SPIT: but that would be S P I T -> 4 letters? SPIT is 4 letters. We need 5: SPIT is 4 letters? No. S P I T is 4. So 5-letter words: 
    - SQUIT? Not a word.
    - SHIRT? But H is allowed, but R is excluded? R is excluded. So SHIRT has R -> invalid.
    - SHIST? Not common -> let's skip.
    - SMIFT? Not a word.
    - SUIT? 4 letters.

  Instead, maybe: S L I T T? But duplicate T? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. T is already at position 5, so if we have T at position 2, it might be duplicate? The secret word might have duplicate letters? Possible, but we haven't encountered duplicates yet.

  Since in the feedback for ""MOIST"", we had T correct at position 5, and S and I as wrong position, but if there were duplicate T, we don't know. But to be safe, we assume no duplicates for now.

  So back: S _ _ I T -> what words? For example:
    - SPIRIT? But that's 6 letters.
    - SPLIT: S P L I T -> that's 5 letters? S P L I T: positions: P1=S, P2=P, P3=L, P4=I, P5=T? But wait, then I is at position 4, which is allowed (since I can be at P4). And we placed S at P1 and I at P4? And T at P5? So that seems valid.

  But does SPLIT have I at position 4? Yes.

  Also, SPLIT: letters S, P, L, I, T -> all acceptable? S, P, L, I, T: no excluded letter? Excluded are A,C,E,M,N,O,R -> so P and L are allowed.

  So ""SPLIT"" is a candidate.

- Another possibility: S at P2, I at P1? For example, I S something T. But I at P1, S at P2: I S _ _ T

  e.g., ISSUE? But not T at end.
  - ISLET? But E is excluded -> invalid.
  - ISTLE? Not standard.
  - Input: I S L E T -> E excluded.
  I S T L E -> no, E at end? But we need T at end? I S something T? I S _ _ T? For example:
    - ISOLT? -> O excluded.
    - ISPUT? Not a word.
    - Hard to find. Skip.

- S at P2, I at P4: word _ S _ I T
  - e.g., USUIT? Not a word.
  - P S Y C H I T? No.
  - More: 
    - ESILE? E excluded.
    - MUSIT? Not common.

- S at P2, I at P1? No, that's covered above.

Another structure: S at P3, I at P1: word I _ S _ T
- e.g., I P S E D -> not ending T? I mean, I ? S ? T -> positions: P1=I, P2=?, P3=S, P4=?, P5=T.
- Example: LIST: 4 letters -> L I S T, but 4. 5-letter: e.g., IGOS T? O excluded.
- Words: I B S O T -> O excluded.
- I L S E T -> E excluded.

Perhaps I at P1, S at P2: I S ? ? T -> as before, hard.

S at P3, I at P2: word _ I S _ T
- e.g., B I S K T? But K allowed? BISKT not word -> BISK is 4 letters.
- F I S H T? FISHT not standard word.
- D I S T Y? But ending Y? T at end? No.

S at P3, I at P4: word _ _ S I T
- e.g., D E S I T -> E excluded.
- V I S I T -> V I S I T -> but I appears twice? And V, I, S, I, T. But we have I at positions 2 and 4? But the secret might have duplicates? Also, position 4 is I, which is allowed, and S at position 3 -> S at position 3 might be allowed? In guess 2 we had S at position 4? Here S at position 3 is different.

But VISIT: letters V, I, S, I, T -> contains I twice? The feedback might get complicated. Moreover, we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

To keep it simple, avoid potential duplicates.

We had a candidate: SPLIT (S P L I T).

In SPLIT:
- S is at position 1 -> we don't know if S can be at P1? We haven't tested it? We know S is not at P4, but it could be at P1, P2, or P3. So P1 is fine.
- I is at position 4 -> similarly, I can be at positions 1,2,4, and we haven't tested P4 for I? In guess 2, I was at P3, so P4 is fresh.
- P3 is L, which we haven't tested? Yes, new letter.

Also, P2 is P.

So ""SPLIT"" seems a good test because:
- It uses new letters P and L.
- It places S at P1 and I at P4, which are untested positions so far.
- It ends with T as required.

Additionally, it adheres to feedback constraints.

However, note that in SPLIT, position 3 is L. What if the secret word has S at position 3? Then we might not test that? But in this guess, we are putting S at position 1, which might be incorrect.

Another possibility: We could test a word that puts S at position 3? But we don't have I at position 3? We need both S and I.

If we put S at position 3? Then I would go to position 1 or 2 or 4.

Say S at P3, and I at P1: word I ? S ? T

But we might not have many choices? Earlier I couldn't find.

What about words with I at P2 and S at P3? For example, ? I S ? T
- e.g., FIST: 4 letters -> F I S T. Not 5.
- LIST: L I S T -> 4.
- MUSTY? Not ending T? M U S T Y -> ending Y? Not T.
- DISTY? D I S T Y -> ending T? No.
- WISPY? W I S P Y -> not T ending.
- HUSKY? Not.

Another common pattern: U S ? I T? But U is available.

Word: SUITE? But E is excluded -> SUITE ends with E? No, SUITE is S U I T E? That's 5? S U I T E -> positions: S at 1, U at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5 -> but E is excluded and also T is not at end? We need T at position 5? In SUITE, T is at position 4? So not.

Perhaps words like: LUSIT? Not word.

Alternative words: FOCUS? Not ending T.

Perhaps ""SPILT"": same as SPLIT? Spilt is a variant of spill? Acceptable.

But I think SPLIT is a standard word.

Another candidate: SHITS? But has S at end? T at position 5? SHI T S -> S at position 5, but we need position 5 as T? So no? S H I T S? Then T at position 4? Not end.

Not.

""TIBIA""? But T at start? But position 5 is T? TIBIA has T at start and end? T I B I A -> not T at position 5? Position 5 is A? A excluded.

No.

Maybe ""SPITZ""? S P I T Z -> T at position 4? Not end.

Not.

So SPLIT seems good.

But we can think of other words: 
- Using U: B U S H I T -> not.
- P U S S Y -> not ending T.

Another idea: ""QUIST""? Not common, and Q might be rare.

""SPLIT"" is acceptable.

In SPLIT, we are testing:
- S at position 1: if ✓ then S is correct, if - then S is elsewhere, etc.
- Similarly for other letters.

But also note: position 2 is P, which is new.

After this guess, we may be able to narrow down.

However, there is another word: we could test a word that places S at position 3? For example, if we choose ""QUITS"": Q U I T S -> positions: P1=Q, P2=U, P3=I? But I at position 3? But I cannot be at position 3 because of feedback! In guess 2, I at position 3 was wrong. So we must avoid putting I at position 3.

Therefore, ""QUITS"" has I at position 3, which is not allowed -> invalid.

Similarly, avoid I at position 3.

Therefore, let's go with SPLIT.

But note: another possibility is S at position 2? I at position 1? For example, I S L E T -> E excluded.

I S S U T? Not standard.

Perhaps ""DITSY"": D I T S Y -> but T at position 3? Not end? and no S at end? D I T S Y -> T at P3, S at P4? But we need T at P5? Not.

I S L E D? Not T.

Hard? So SPLIT seems a solid choice.

We might also consider ""SWIFT"": S W I F T -> that's 5 letters? S at 1, W at 2, I at 3, F at 4, T at 5? But I at position 3? We cannot put I at position 3. So invalid.

Similarly, ""SHIFT"" has I at P3 -> invalid.

Therefore, we choose ""SPLIT"".

Let me confirm constraints:
- Letters used: S, P, L, I, T -> T is known to be in word? Yes, at P5. S and I are known to be in word. P and L are new? Yes?
- But L is new? Yes.

In guess 2, we used M, O, I, S, T -> so L and P are new, so we test them.

If the feedback on S and I can give their positions.

So next guess: SPLIT.

But note: the word might have more than one of I or S? But since we are putting I only at P4 and S at P1, and others new? If there is duplicate, the feedback might show? We'll see.

Therefore, I will guess ""SPLIT"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **CRANE** all letters absent: Eliminates C, R, A, N, E. Secret word has none of these.
- **MOIST** feedback: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(-) T(✓) reveals:
  - **T must be in position 5**: Secret word ends with T.
  - **I is present but not in position 3**.
  - **S is present but not in position 4**.
  - **M and O are absent**, eliminating them.
- Excluded letters so far: A, C, E, M, N, O, R.

For this guess, I prioritize:
1. Ending with **T** (position 5) to maintain the known correct placement.
2. Including **I and S**, but avoiding position 3 for I and position 4 for S.
3. Testing new common letters to gather more information (choosing unused consonants like P and L).
4. Avoiding duplicates and excluded letters.

Selected **""SPLIT""** because:
- Starts with **S** (tests position 1 for S, since it can't be in position 4 but could be in 1, 2, or 3).
- Places **I in position 4** (a new, untested position allowed by feedback).
- Uses new letters **P** (position 2) and **L** (position 3) to probe for inclusion/position.
- Follows all constraints: no I in position 3, no S in position 4, no excluded letters.

But position 3 we had I, but it\'s wrong, so I can\'t be at position 3. So I can be at positions 1, 2, or 4.\n\nBut position 4: we know the fifth is T, so position 4 must be a letter that is not S. But I could be at position 4? Yes, because we only know that I is not at position 3 and S is not at position 4.\n\nWe also know S is in the word, but not at position 4.

So we have at least I, S, T.\n\nSince T is fixed at the end, we have four other positions to fill.\n\nWe need to form a word that has T at the end, includes I and S, and avoids the excluded letters.\n\nNow, current known positions: T is at position 5.\n\nWe need to assign I and S to other positions (not 3 for I, not 4 for S) and fill the remaining two letters.\n\nOur next guess should aim to:\n- Test possible positions for I and S.\n- Test new letters for the remaining positions to gather more information.\n\nWe know:\n- Position 5: T (fixed)\n- The word has I and S.\n\nPossible structure: let the word be [P1][P2][P3][P4] T\n\nConstraints:\n- P3 cannot be I (because guess 2 had I at position 3 and it was wrong)\n- P4 cannot be S (because guess 2 had S at position 4 and it was wrong, meaning S is elsewhere)\n\nSo I must be in P1, P2, or P4? But P4 is the fourth position. If I is at P4, that is acceptable since we only know it can\'t be at P3.\n\nSimilarly, S must be in P1, P2, or P3? Because P4 cannot be S? Actually, we placed S at P4 in guess 2 and it was marked wrong (wrong position), meaning S is not at P4, so S must be at P1, P2, or P3.\n\nBut P3: we don\'t know yet.\n\nSo:\n- S in {P1, P2, P3}\n- I in {P1, P2, P4}  (because P3 is forbidden for I)\n\nNow, we also note that the same letter might not be repeated? We don\'t know about duplicates yet, but since we have no feedback suggesting duplicates and we want to maximize information, it\'s safer to avoid duplicates for now.\n\nWe need to choose a word that fits these constraints.\n\nMoreover, we need to test new letters to rule out more possibilities.\n\nWe have excluded 7 letters: A, C, E, M, N, O, R. So we can use the remaining.\n\nGood candidates might include common letters like L, H, P, U, etc.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm some words that end with T and contain I and S.\n\nExamples:\n- EXIST? But E and X not used? But E is excluded, and we don\'t know about X but let\'s think. Also, E is excluded, so not EXIST.\n- PULSIT? Not a word.\n- SHIFT: H is allowed? S at position 1? But S at P1 -> then I at P4? SHIFT: S H I F T -> that would be S at P1, H at P2, I at P3? But in our guess, I at P3 was wrong? In guess 2, we placed I at position 3 and it was marked as wrong position. So if we try SHIFT, I is at position 3 again? Same position? So if I is not at position 3 in the secret, then SHIFT would be invalid? Not necessarily: the symbol ""-"" for I in MOIST means I is in the word but not at the guessed position (position 3). Therefore, in SHIFT, if we put I at position 3, that would not be allowed because we already know I cannot be at position 3? Exactly. Therefore, we must not put I at position 3 again.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put S at position 4 again.\n\nTherefore, SHIFT has I at position 3, which is forbidden? So we cannot use a word with I at position 3 or S at position 4. Hence, SHIFT is invalid because I is at position 3.\n\nSimilarly, other words.\n\nWhat about POSIT? P O S I T -> but O is excluded? Yes, O is excluded from guess 2. So not allowed.\n\nSo list of words ending with T, containing S and I, and without the excluded letters.\n\nWithout: A, C, E, M, N, O, R.\n\nAnd S not at position 4, I not at position 3.\n\nSo S can be at 1,2,3 and I at 1,2,4.\n\nPossible words:\n- S at P1, I at P2: e.g., S L I T T? But T at end, wait. S L I T? No, that\'s 4 letters. S something I something T. S L I P T? Slip is 4 letters. SLIPT not common, but you might say SLIPT (archaic past of slip). But let\'s find standard words.\n- S at P1, I at P4: word S _ _ I T\n  - e.g., SPIT: but that would be S P I T -> 4 letters? SPIT is 4 letters. We need 5: SPIT is 4 letters? No. S P I T is 4. So 5-letter words: \n    - SQUIT? Not a word.\n    - SHIRT? But H is allowed, but R is excluded? R is excluded. So SHIRT has R -> invalid.\n    - SHIST? Not common -> let\'s skip.\n    - SMIFT? Not a word.\n    - SUIT? 4 letters.\n\n  Instead, maybe: S L I T T? But duplicate T? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. T is already at position 5, so if we have T at position 2, it might be duplicate? The secret word might have duplicate letters? Possible, but we haven\'t encountered duplicates yet.\n\n  Since in the feedback for ""MOIST"", we had T correct at position 5, and S and I as wrong position, but if there were duplicate T, we don\'t know. But to be safe, we assume no duplicates for now.\n\n  So back: S _ _ I T -> what words? For example:\n    - SPIRIT? But that\'s 6 letters.\n    - SPLIT: S P L I T -> that\'s 5 letters? S P L I T: positions: P1=S, P2=P, P3=L, P4=I, P5=T? But wait, then I is at position 4, which is allowed (since I can be at P4). And we placed S at P1 and I at P4? And T at P5? So that seems valid.\n\n  But does SPLIT have I at position 4? Yes.\n\n  Also, SPLIT: letters S, P, L, I, T -> all acceptable? S, P, L, I, T: no excluded letter? Excluded are A,C,E,M,N,O,R -> so P and L are allowed.\n\n  So ""SPLIT"" is a candidate.\n\n- Another possibility: S at P2, I at P1? For example, I S something T. But I at P1, S at P2: I S _ _ T\n\n  e.g., ISSUE? But not T at end.\n  - ISLET? But E is excluded -> invalid.\n  - ISTLE? Not standard.\n  - Input: I S L E T -> E excluded.\n  I S T L E -> no, E at end? But we need T at end? I S something T? I S _ _ T? For example:\n    - ISOLT? -> O excluded.\n    - ISPUT? Not a word.\n    - Hard to find. Skip.\n\n- S at P2, I at P4: word _ S _ I T\n  - e.g., USUIT? Not a word.\n  - P S Y C H I T? No.\n  - More: \n    - ESILE? E excluded.\n    - MUSIT? Not common.\n\n- S at P2, I at P1? No, that\'s covered above.\n\nAnother structure: S at P3, I at P1: word I _ S _ T\n- e.g., I P S E D -> not ending T? I mean, I ? S ? T -> positions: P1=I, P2=?, P3=S, P4=?, P5=T.\n- Example: LIST: 4 letters -> L I S T, but 4. 5-letter: e.g., IGOS T? O excluded.\n- Words: I B S O T -> O excluded.\n- I L S E T -> E excluded.\n\nPerhaps I at P1, S at P2: I S ? ? T -> as before, hard.\n\nS at P3, I at P2: word _ I S _ T\n- e.g., B I S K T? But K allowed? BISKT not word -> BISK is 4 letters.\n- F I S H T? FISHT not standard word.\n- D I S T Y? But ending Y? T at end? No.\n\nS at P3, I at P4: word _ _ S I T\n- e.g., D E S I T -> E excluded.\n- V I S I T -> V I S I T -> but I appears twice? And V, I, S, I, T. But we have I at positions 2 and 4? But the secret might have duplicates? Also, position 4 is I, which is allowed, and S at position 3 -> S at position 3 might be allowed? In guess 2 we had S at position 4? Here S at position 3 is different.\n\nBut VISIT: letters V, I, S, I, T -> contains I twice? The feedback might get complicated. Moreover, we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed.\n\nTo keep it simple, avoid potential duplicates.\n\nWe had a candidate: SPLIT (S P L I T).\n\nIn SPLIT:\n- S is at position 1 -> we don\'t know if S can be at P1? We haven\'t tested it? We know S is not at P4, but it could be at P1, P2, or P3. So P1 is fine.\n- I is at position 4 -> similarly, I can be at positions 1,2,4, and we haven\'t tested P4 for I? In guess 2, I was at P3, so P4 is fresh.\n- P3 is L, which we haven\'t tested? Yes, new letter.\n\nAlso, P2 is P.\n\nSo ""SPLIT"" seems a good test because:\n- It uses new letters P and L.\n- It places S at P1 and I at P4, which are untested positions so far.\n- It ends with T as required.\n\nAdditionally, it adheres to feedback constraints.\n\nHowever, note that in SPLIT, position 3 is L. What if the secret word has S at position 3? Then we might not test that? But in this guess, we are putting S at position 1, which might be incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility: We could test a word that puts S at position 3? But we don\'t have I at position 3? We need both S and I.\n\nIf we put S at position 3? Then I would go to position 1 or 2 or 4.\n\nSay S at P3, and I at P1: word I ? S ? T\n\nBut we might not have many choices? Earlier I couldn\'t find.\n\nWhat about words with I at P2 and S at P3? For example, ? I S ? T\n- e.g., FIST: 4 letters -> F I S T. Not 5.\n- LIST: L I S T -> 4.\n- MUSTY? Not ending T? M U S T Y -> ending Y? Not T.\n- DISTY? D I S T Y -> ending T? No.\n- WISPY? W I S P Y -> not T ending.\n- HUSKY? Not.\n\nAnother common pattern: U S ? I T? But U is available.\n\nWord: SUITE? But E is excluded -> SUITE ends with E? No, SUITE is S U I T E? That\'s 5? S U I T E -> positions: S at 1, U at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5 -> but E is excluded and also T is not at end? We need T at position 5? In SUITE, T is at position 4? So not.\n\nPerhaps words like: LUSIT? Not word.\n\nAlternative words: FOCUS? Not ending T.\n\nPerhaps ""SPILT"": same as SPLIT? Spilt is a variant of spill? Acceptable.\n\nBut I think SPLIT is a standard word.\n\nAnother candidate: SHITS? But has S at end? T at position 5? SHI T S -> S at position 5, but we need position 5 as T? So no? S H I T S? Then T at position 4? Not end.\n\nNot.\n\n""TIBIA""? But T at start? But position 5 is T? TIBIA has T at start and end? T I B I A -> not T at position 5? Position 5 is A? A excluded.\n\nNo.\n\nMaybe ""SPITZ""? S P I T Z -> T at position 4? Not end.\n\nNot.\n\nSo SPLIT seems good.\n\nBut we can think of other words: \n- Using U: B U S H I T -> not.\n- P U S S Y -> not ending T.\n\nAnother idea: ""QUIST""? Not common, and Q might be rare.\n\n""SPLIT"" is acceptable.\n\nIn SPLIT, we are testing:\n- S at position 1: if ✓ then S is correct, if - then S is elsewhere, etc.\n- Similarly for other letters.\n\nBut also note: position 2 is P, which is new.\n\nAfter this guess, we may be able to narrow down.\n\nHowever, there is another word: we could test a word that places S at position 3? For example, if we choose ""QUITS"": Q U I T S -> positions: P1=Q, P2=U, P3=I? But I at position 3? But I cannot be at position 3 because of feedback! In guess 2, I at position 3 was wrong. So we must avoid putting I at position 3.\n\nTherefore, ""QUITS"" has I at position 3, which is not allowed -> invalid.\n\nSimilarly, avoid I at position 3.\n\nTherefore, let\'s go with SPLIT.\n\nBut note: another possibility is S at position 2? I at position 1? For example, I S L E T -> E excluded.\n\nI S S U T? Not standard.\n\nPerhaps ""DITSY"": D I T S Y -> but T at position 3? Not end? and no S at end? D I T S Y -> T at P3, S at P4? But we need T at P5? Not.\n\nI S L E D? Not T.\n\nHard? So SPLIT seems a solid choice.\n\nWe might also consider ""SWIFT"": S W I F T -> that\'s 5 letters? S at 1, W at 2, I at 3, F at 4, T at 5? But I at position 3? We cannot put I at position 3. So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHIFT"" has I at P3 -> invalid.\n\nTherefore, we choose ""SPLIT"".\n\nLet me confirm constraints:\n- Letters used: S, P, L, I, T -> T is known to be in word? Yes, at P5. S and I are known to be in word. P and L are new? Yes?\n- But L is new? Yes.\n\nIn guess 2, we used M, O, I, S, T -> so L and P are new, so we test them.\n\nIf the feedback on S and I can give their positions.\n\nSo next guess: SPLIT.\n\nBut note: the word might have more than one of I or S? But since we are putting I only at P4 and S at P1, and others new? If there is duplicate, the feedback might show? We\'ll see.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""SPLIT"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **CRANE** all letters absent: Eliminates C, R, A, N, E. Secret word has none of these.\n- **MOIST** feedback: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(-) T(✓) reveals:\n  - **T must be in position 5**: Secret word ends with T.\n  - **I is present but not in position 3**.\n  - **S is present but not in position 4**.\n  - **M and O are absent**, eliminating them.\n- Excluded letters so far: A, C, E, M, N, O, R.\n\nFor this guess, I prioritize:\n1. Ending with **T** (position 5) to maintain the known correct placement.\n2. Including **I and S**, but avoiding position 3 for I and position 4 for S.\n3. Testing new common letters to gather more information (choosing unused consonants like P and L).\n4. Avoiding duplicates and excluded letters.\n\nSelected **""SPLIT""** because:\n- Starts with **S** (tests position 1 for S, since it can\'t be in position 4 but could be in 1, 2, or 3).\n- Places **I in position 4** (a new, untested position allowed by feedback).\n- Uses new letters **P** (position 2) and **L** (position 3) to probe for inclusion/position.\n- Follows all constraints: no I in position 3, no S in position 4, no excluded letters.\n\n<guess>SPLIT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: MOIST -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(-) S(-) T(✓)\nGuess 3: SPLIT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) L(x) I(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback history:
- Guess 1: CRANE -> all letters absent (x): so secret word has none of C, R, A, N, E.
- Guess 2: MOIST -> M(x), O(x), I(-), S(-), T(✓): 
  - T is correct at position 5.
  - I is present but not at position 3.
  - S is present but not at position 4.
  - M and O are absent.
- Guess 3: SPLIT -> S(-), P(x), L(x), I(✓), T(✓):
  - I is correct at position 4? In SPLIT, I is at position 4? Let's see: S P L I T -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:L, 4:I, 5:T.
  - Feedback: I(✓) and T(✓) so I is correct at position 4 and T at position 5.
  - S is present but not at position 1 (since it's marked as -).
  - P and L are absent.

So now we know:
- The secret word has T at position 5 and I at position 4: so the word ends with ""IT"".
- The secret word contains S, but not at position 1 (from SPLIT feedback) and not at position 4 (from MOIST feedback). Since position 4 is now I, S cannot be at position 4 anyway. Also, from MOIST, S was at position 4 and was wrong, so S is not at 4. Now from SPLIT, S at position 1 is also wrong. Therefore, S must be at position 2 or 3? Because the positions are 1,2,3,4,5 and 4 and 5 are taken by I and T, and position 1 is not S. So S must be at position 2 or 3.

Additionally, we know the word contains I and S, and T, and no other letters from the absent list.

Absent letters: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, P, L (from guesses).

Also, from MOIST, I was not at position 3, but now we know I is at position 4, so that's consistent.

Now, the word structure: positions 1,2,3,4,5 = [ ? , ? , ? , I, T ]

S must be at position 2 or 3.

We also know that the word has exactly these letters? Not necessarily, but we know it has at least S, I, T, and two other letters.

The two other letters are from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent ones.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S, I, T are in, but S is placed? Not yet, we know it's in the word but not at 1 or 4, so must be at 2 or 3).

We need to find a word of the form: [letter1] [S or not] [S or not] I T, with S in either position 2 or 3.

Specifically:
- If S is at position 2: then word is [X] [S] [Y] I T, where X and Y are letters to be determined, and Y cannot be S (unless duplicate, but we don't know, so avoid for now).
- If S is at position 3: then word is [X] [Y] [S] I T.

X and Y must be from the available letters, and not in the absent list.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also need to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test the position of S and also test new letters.

We have two cases for S: position 2 or 3.

We can design a guess that helps distinguish between these and also tests common letters.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? We are on guess 4 of 6.

We also know that position 4 and 5 are fixed as I and T, so we can only change positions 1,2,3.

Let me think of possible words.

First, if S is at position 2: words like ? S ? I T
- Examples: USHIT? Not a word.
- ASSET? But A and E excluded.
- B S ? I T: e.g., BASIC? A and C excluded.
- D S ? I T: D S H I T -> DSHIT? Not a word.
- F S ? I T: FS?IT? Not common.
- G S ? I T: GS?IT? e.g., GUSIT? Not.
- H S ? I T: HS?IT? e.g., HUSIT? Not.
- J S ? I T: JS?IT? Not.
- K S ? I T: KS?IT? Not.
- Q S ? I T: QS?IT? Not.
- U S ? I T: US?IT? e.g., USNIT? Not, or UNIT? But UNIT is 4 letters? UNIT is 4. 5-letter: UNITY? But ends with Y? Not T.
- V S ? I T: VS?IT? Not.
- W S ? I T: WS?IT? Not.
- X S ? I T: XS?IT? Not.
- Y S ? I T: YS?IT? Not.
- Z S ? I T: ZS?IT? Not.

This seems difficult. Maybe S at position 3 is more common.

If S at position 3: words like ? ? S I T
- Examples: POSIT? But O and P excluded? P is excluded from SPLIT feedback? P was absent in SPLIT, so excluded. O excluded from MOIST.
- FUSIT? Not.
- BUSIT? Not.
- MUSIT? M excluded.
- DESIT? E excluded.
- RESIT? R and E excluded.
- But we have available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So, for ? ? S I T:
- First letter: one of B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Second letter: similarly, but not conflicting.

Common words: 
- EXIT? E and X? E excluded.
- SUIT? S U I T -> but 4 letters? SUIT is 4. 5-letter: SUITE? E excluded.
- QUITS? Q U I T S -> but I is at position 3? In QUITS: Q U I T S -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:T, 5:S -> but we need I at position 4 and T at 5? Not matching. Also, I at position 3 is forbidden.

We need I at 4 and T at 5.

So ? ? S I T.

Examples:
- FOCUS? Not ending IT.
- Perhaps ""PUSHY""? Not ending IT.

Another idea: ""VISIT"" -> V I S I T -> but I at position 2 and 4? And S at position 3. So V I S I T: positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T -> but we have I at position 4, which is correct, but also I at position 2? And S at position 3. But in this case, the word has two I's? And position 2 is I, but we don't know if that's allowed? Also, from feedback, we know I is in the word, but it could be multiple? But in MOIST, we had I at position 3 and it was wrong, but if there is another I, it might be okay? However, in VISIT, position 3 is S, not I. So I at position 2 is new.

But let's check the letters: V, I, S, I, T -> V is allowed? Yes, not excluded. But we have I at position 2? We don't have feedback on position 2 for I. But in VISIT, the second letter is I, which might be correct or not.

But our known correct positions are 4:I and 5:T. So in VISIT, position 4 is I (correct), position 5 is T (correct), position 3 is S (which we know is in the word, and position 3 is a possible position for S? Yes, since S can be at 2 or 3). And position 1 is V, position 2 is I.

But we don't know if I can be at position 2? It might be, but we also have I at position 4. The feedback for I in MOIST was that I is in the word but not at position 3, so it could be at 2 or 4. Now we have I at 4, so if there is another I at 2, it's possible.

But in the feedback for SPLIT, we had I at position 4 correct, so that I is fixed. If there is another I, it would be additional.

But let's see if VISIT is a valid guess? Yes, it is a word.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: V is not excluded, I and S are in, T in. So VISIT is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""UNFIT""? U N F I T -> but N is excluded? From CRANE, N is absent. So invalid.

""FUSTY""? F U S T Y -> ends with Y? Not T.

""GUSSY""? Not ending T.

""BUSKY""? Not common.

""DUSTY""? Ends with Y.

""JUMPS""? Not ending T.

Perhaps ""HUSKY""? H U S K Y -> not ending T.

"" MUSHY""? M excluded.

"" PUSSY""? P excluded and not ending T.

"" WUSHU""? Not.

"" VISIT"" seems a good candidate.

Another one: ""VISIT"" or ""EXIST"" but E excluded.

""WHIST"": W H I S T -> but I at position 3? WHIST: W H I S T -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> but we need I at position 4? Here I is at 3, which is forbidden, and S at 4, which is also forbidden? From MOIST, S at position 4 was wrong, so S cannot be at 4. In WHIST, S is at position 4? So invalid.

Similarly, ""WAIST"": W A I S T -> A excluded.

""JOIST"": J O I S T -> O excluded.

""FOIST"": F O I S T -> O excluded.

So ""VISIT"" is a possibility.

But in ""VISIT"", we have:
- Position 1: V (new)
- Position 2: I (we know I is in the word, but is it at position 2? We don't know)
- Position 3: S (which is in the word, and position 3 is a candidate for S)
- Position 4: I (correct, fixed)
- Position 5: T (correct, fixed)

If we guess ""VISIT"", we can get feedback on V, I at position 2, and S at position 3.

But we also have a duplicate I? The word has two I's? In VISIT, there are two I's? V-I-S-I-T, so yes, two I's.

The feedback might be: 
- If the secret word has only one I, then the I at position 2 might be marked as absent or wrong position? But since there is an I at position 4, the I at position 2 might be marked as present but wrong position if there is another I, or absent if not.

But we don't know if there is a duplicate I.

To avoid complexity, maybe we can choose a word without duplicates.

Is there a word like ? ? S I T without duplicate and without excluded letters?

For example, with S at position 3: 
- First letter: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Second letter: similarly, but not I? Because if we put I at position 2, then it might be duplicate if the word requires only one I? But we don't know.

But in our case, we know the word has at least one I (at position 4), so if we put I at position 2, it might be an additional I.

To test, we can avoid I at position 2.

So for S at position 3, we want position 2 to be a different letter.

Examples: 
- B U S I T -> BUSIT? Not a standard word.
- D U S I T -> DUSIT? Not.
- F U S I T -> FUSIT? Not.
- G U S I T -> GUSIT? Not.
- H U S I T -> HUSIT? Not.
- J U S I T -> JUSIT? Not.
- K I S I T -> KISIT? Not, and I at position 2.
- Q U S I T -> QUSIT? Not.
- V U S I T -> VUSIT? Not.
- W U S I T -> WUSIT? Not.
- X U S I T -> XUSIT? Not.
- Y U S I T -> YUSIT? Not.
- Z U S I T -> ZUSIT? Not.

With H: H A S I T -> A excluded.

Perhaps ""SHIFT"" but I at position 3 forbidden.

Another idea: ""UNLIT"" but N and L excluded.

"" DAISY"" not ending T.

Perhaps we need to consider that S might be at position 2.

With S at position 2: [X] [S] [Y] I T

X and Y from available letters.

Examples:
- U S E I T -> E excluded.
- U S B I T -> USBIT? Not word.
- U S H I T -> USHIT? Not.
- B S M I T -> M excluded.
- D S H I T -> DSHIT? Not.
- F S K I T -> FSKIT? Not.
- G S P I T -> P excluded.
- H S M I T -> M excluded.
- J S K I T -> not.
- K S L I T -> L excluded.
- Q S U I T -> QSUIT? Not.
- V S K I T -> not.
- W S H I T -> WSHIT? Not.
- X S Y I T -> not.
- Y S T I T -> duplicate T? Y S T I T -> T at position 3 and 5? But position 5 is T, so if T is at position 3, it might be duplicate.

But ""YSTIT"" not a word.

""BESET"" E excluded.

This is difficult. 

Another common word: ""SUEDE"" E excluded.

Perhaps ""QUITE"" E excluded.

Maybe we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters, so ""VISIT"" is a valid option.

Or ""HABIT"" A excluded.

"" RABID"" R and A excluded.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words ending with ""IT"" that contain S and have no excluded letters.

Excluded letters: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, P, L.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Words ending with ""IT"":
- From dictionary, common ones: 
  - HABIT: H A B I T -> A excluded.
  - RABIT: R and A excluded.
  - BIT: 3 letters.
  - COMMIT: C, O, M excluded.
  - ADMIT: A, M excluded.
  - SUBMIT: S U B M I T -> M excluded.
  - TRANSMIT: too long.
  - LIMIT: L, I at position 2? L I M I T -> L and M excluded.
  - VISIT: V I S I T -> letters: V, I, S, I, T. V is allowed, I and S are in, T in. But has two I's. And positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. 
    - S is at position 3, which is allowed (since S can be at 2 or 3).
    - I at position 2: this is an additional I? The secret word has I at position 4, so if it has another I at position 2, then it's fine. If not, then I at position 2 might be wrong.
  - EXIT: E excluded.
  - UNZIP: not ending IT.
  - FRUIT: F R U I T -> R excluded.
  - SUIT: 4 letters.
  - QUIT: 4 letters.
  - TOILET: O, E, and T not at end? T O I L E T -> not ending with IT? Ends with ET.
  - SPIRIT: S P I R I T -> P and R excluded.
  - AUDIT: A, U, D? A U D I T -> A excluded.
  - CREDIT: C, R, E excluded.
  - EDIT: E excluded.
  - MERIT: M, E, R excluded.
  - INUIT: I N U I T -> N excluded.
  - OPPOSIT: O, P, not 5.
  - POSIT: P, O excluded.
  - REWRIT: E, R.
  - TACIT: A, C excluded.
  - UNFIT: U N F I T -> N excluded.
  - VOMIT: O, M excluded.
  - WOVEN: not ending IT.

So from this, ""VISIT"" is the only common word I can think of.

Perhaps ""BUSKY"" not ending IT.

Or ""CUSHY"" C excluded.

So likely, the word is ""VISIT"" or a less common word.

Another possibility: ""DUVET"" not ending IT.

Perhaps ""GUILD"" not ending IT.

We might have to guess ""VISIT"".

But let's see the feedback from previous guesses.

In guess 2, MOIST had I at position 3 marked as present but wrong position. But in the secret word, I is at position 4, so that's consistent. Also, S at position 4 was wrong, and in the secret, position 4 is I, so S is elsewhere.

In guess 3, SPLIT had S at position 1 marked as present but wrong position, so S is not at 1.

So S must be at position 2 or 3.

If we guess ""VISIT"", we put S at position 3, which is a candidate.

Also, we put I at position 2, which might be present or not.

If the secret word is ""VISIT"", then it has two I's.

If not, it might be a word with S at position 2 and no I at position 2.

But we are struggling to find such a word.

Another word: ""WHIST"" but O excluded? WHIST is W H I S T, but I at position 3 and S at position 4, both of which are forbidden positions? Position 3 for I is forbidden, position 4 for S is forbidden.

So not.

""SHIST"" not common.

Perhaps ""SUQ"" not 5.

I think ""VISIT"" is our best bet.

Or ""BEGIT"" not a word.

So I will go with ""VISIT"".

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the secret is not VISIT.

Suppose the secret has S at position 2, then it would be ? S ? I T.

For example, if it's ""USNIT"" not word, or ""BSMIT"" not.

Perhaps it's ""CUSP"" not ending IT.

I think we have to guess ""VISIT"".

So next guess: VISIT.

But in the feedback, for VISIT, we would have:
- V at position 1: if absent or present?
- I at position 2: if present and correct, or present but wrong position, or absent?
- S at position 3: similarly.
- I at position 4: correct.
- T at position 5: correct.

But since position 4 and 5 are fixed, we only care about 1,2,3.

If we guess VISIT and the secret is not VISIT, we might get information.

For example, if S is at position 2, then in VISIT, S is at position 3, so it would be marked as absent? Or present but wrong position? Since S is in the word, if it's not at position 3, it would be marked as present but wrong position (-).

Similarly for other letters.

So it could work.

Perhaps there is a word like ""HUSK"" not 5.

Another idea: ""DUSTY"" not ending T.

I think we should go with ""VISIT"".

So guess: VISIT

But let's see if there's a better guess that tests more letters.

For example, we could guess a word that has S at position 2 or 3 and uses new letters.

But with the fixed IT at the end, it's hard.

Guess: for example, ""BUSHY"" not ending T.

Or ""FISHY"" not ending T.

Perhaps ""SWIFT"" but I at position 3 forbidden.

I think ""VISIT"" is the most reasonable.

So I'll go with that.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE → All letters absent (x)**: Secret word contains none of C, R, A, N, E.
- **Guess 2: MOIST → M(x), O(x), I(-), S(-), T(✓)**:
  - T is correct at position 5 (secret ends with T).
  - I is present but not in position 3.
  - S is present but not in position 4.
  - M and O are absent.
- **Guess 3: SPLIT → S(-), P(x), L(x), I(✓), T(✓)**:
  - I is correct at position 4 (secret has I in position 4).
  - T is correct at position 5 (confirmed).
  - S is present but not in position 1.
  - P and L are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Positions**:
   - Position 4 must be **I**.
   - Position 5 must be **T**.
   - Secret word structure: `[ ? , ? , ? , I, T]`.
2. **S Position Constraints**:
   - S is present but cannot be in position 1 (from SPLIT feedback) or position 4 (from MOIST feedback). Since positions 4–5 are fixed, S must be in **position 2 or 3**.
3. **Excluded Letters**:
   - Absent so far: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, P, L (9 letters excluded).
   - Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
4. **Word Requirements**:
   - Must include S (in position 2 or 3) and the fixed ""IT"" ending.
   - No duplicates detected yet, but possible (e.g., if I appears twice).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test S Position**: Since S must be in position 2 or 3, prioritize a word that places S in one of these positions to resolve ambiguity.
- **Leverage Common Letters**: Use high-frequency remaining letters (e.g., U, V, H) to maximize information.
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Do not reuse excluded letters or test invalid positions (e.g., no S in position 1 or 4, no I in position 3).
- **Candidate Selection**: After evaluating options (e.g., BUSIT, DUSIT, FUSIT—all invalid), **""VISIT""** is the strongest choice because:
  - It places S in position 3 (a valid candidate position).
  - It tests V (new letter) and I in position 2 (which may reveal if I is duplicated).
  - It adheres to fixed positions (I at 4, T at 5).
  - It uses no excluded letters and is a valid English word.
- **Risk of Duplicates**: ""VISIT"" has two I's, which may help confirm if duplicates exist (e.g., if I in position 2 is present).

### Expected Feedback from ""VISIT"":
- If S is in position 3, it may be marked ✓ (correct) or - (wrong position if secret has S elsewhere).
- V and I (position 2) will test new letters/positions.
- Feedback will narrow S's position and reveal if V or additional I is present.

<guess>VISIT</guess>",VISIT,"We have the following feedback history:
- Guess 1: CRANE -> all letters absent (x): so secret word has none of C, R, A, N, E.
- Guess 2: MOIST -> M(x), O(x), I(-), S(-), T(✓): 
  - T is correct at position 5.
  - I is present but not at position 3.
  - S is present but not at position 4.
  - M and O are absent.
- Guess 3: SPLIT -> S(-), P(x), L(x), I(✓), T(✓):
  - I is correct at position 4? In SPLIT, I is at position 4? Let's see: S P L I T -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:L, 4:I, 5:T.
  - Feedback: I(✓) and T(✓) so I is correct at position 4 and T at position 5.
  - S is present but not at position 1 (since it's marked as -).
  - P and L are absent.

So now we know:
- The secret word has T at position 5 and I at position 4: so the word ends with ""IT"".
- The secret word contains S, but not at position 1 (from SPLIT feedback) and not at position 4 (from MOIST feedback). Since position 4 is now I, S cannot be at position 4 anyway. Also, from MOIST, S was at position 4 and was wrong, so S is not at 4. Now from SPLIT, S at position 1 is also wrong. Therefore, S must be at position 2 or 3? Because the positions are 1,2,3,4,5 and 4 and 5 are taken by I and T, and position 1 is not S. So S must be at position 2 or 3.

Additionally, we know the word contains I and S, and T, and no other letters from the absent list.

Absent letters: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, P, L (from guesses).

Also, from MOIST, I was not at position 3, but now we know I is at position 4, so that's consistent.

Now, the word structure: positions 1,2,3,4,5 = [ ? , ? , ? , I, T ]

S must be at position 2 or 3.

We also know that the word has exactly these letters? Not necessarily, but we know it has at least S, I, T, and two other letters.

The two other letters are from the remaining alphabet, excluding the absent ones.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S, I, T are in, but S is placed? Not yet, we know it's in the word but not at 1 or 4, so must be at 2 or 3).

We need to find a word of the form: [letter1] [S or not] [S or not] I T, with S in either position 2 or 3.

Specifically:
- If S is at position 2: then word is [X] [S] [Y] I T, where X and Y are letters to be determined, and Y cannot be S (unless duplicate, but we don't know, so avoid for now).
- If S is at position 3: then word is [X] [Y] [S] I T.

X and Y must be from the available letters, and not in the absent list.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also need to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Now, for the next guess, we want to test the position of S and also test new letters.

We have two cases for S: position 2 or 3.

We can design a guess that helps distinguish between these and also tests common letters.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? We are on guess 4 of 6.

We also know that position 4 and 5 are fixed as I and T, so we can only change positions 1,2,3.

Let me think of possible words.

First, if S is at position 2: words like ? S ? I T
- Examples: USHIT? Not a word.
- ASSET? But A and E excluded.
- B S ? I T: e.g., BASIC? A and C excluded.
- D S ? I T: D S H I T -> DSHIT? Not a word.
- F S ? I T: FS?IT? Not common.
- G S ? I T: GS?IT? e.g., GUSIT? Not.
- H S ? I T: HS?IT? e.g., HUSIT? Not.
- J S ? I T: JS?IT? Not.
- K S ? I T: KS?IT? Not.
- Q S ? I T: QS?IT? Not.
- U S ? I T: US?IT? e.g., USNIT? Not, or UNIT? But UNIT is 4 letters? UNIT is 4. 5-letter: UNITY? But ends with Y? Not T.
- V S ? I T: VS?IT? Not.
- W S ? I T: WS?IT? Not.
- X S ? I T: XS?IT? Not.
- Y S ? I T: YS?IT? Not.
- Z S ? I T: ZS?IT? Not.

This seems difficult. Maybe S at position 3 is more common.

If S at position 3: words like ? ? S I T
- Examples: POSIT? But O and P excluded? P is excluded from SPLIT feedback? P was absent in SPLIT, so excluded. O excluded from MOIST.
- FUSIT? Not.
- BUSIT? Not.
- MUSIT? M excluded.
- DESIT? E excluded.
- RESIT? R and E excluded.
- But we have available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So, for ? ? S I T:
- First letter: one of B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Second letter: similarly, but not conflicting.

Common words: 
- EXIT? E and X? E excluded.
- SUIT? S U I T -> but 4 letters? SUIT is 4. 5-letter: SUITE? E excluded.
- QUITS? Q U I T S -> but I is at position 3? In QUITS: Q U I T S -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:I, 4:T, 5:S -> but we need I at position 4 and T at 5? Not matching. Also, I at position 3 is forbidden.

We need I at 4 and T at 5.

So ? ? S I T.

Examples:
- FOCUS? Not ending IT.
- Perhaps ""PUSHY""? Not ending IT.

Another idea: ""VISIT"" -> V I S I T -> but I at position 2 and 4? And S at position 3. So V I S I T: positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T -> but we have I at position 4, which is correct, but also I at position 2? And S at position 3. But in this case, the word has two I's? And position 2 is I, but we don't know if that's allowed? Also, from feedback, we know I is in the word, but it could be multiple? But in MOIST, we had I at position 3 and it was wrong, but if there is another I, it might be okay? However, in VISIT, position 3 is S, not I. So I at position 2 is new.

But let's check the letters: V, I, S, I, T -> V is allowed? Yes, not excluded. But we have I at position 2? We don't have feedback on position 2 for I. But in VISIT, the second letter is I, which might be correct or not.

But our known correct positions are 4:I and 5:T. So in VISIT, position 4 is I (correct), position 5 is T (correct), position 3 is S (which we know is in the word, and position 3 is a possible position for S? Yes, since S can be at 2 or 3). And position 1 is V, position 2 is I.

But we don't know if I can be at position 2? It might be, but we also have I at position 4. The feedback for I in MOIST was that I is in the word but not at position 3, so it could be at 2 or 4. Now we have I at 4, so if there is another I at 2, it's possible.

But in the feedback for SPLIT, we had I at position 4 correct, so that I is fixed. If there is another I, it would be additional.

But let's see if VISIT is a valid guess? Yes, it is a word.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: V is not excluded, I and S are in, T in. So VISIT is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""UNFIT""? U N F I T -> but N is excluded? From CRANE, N is absent. So invalid.

""FUSTY""? F U S T Y -> ends with Y? Not T.

""GUSSY""? Not ending T.

""BUSKY""? Not common.

""DUSTY""? Ends with Y.

""JUMPS""? Not ending T.

Perhaps ""HUSKY""? H U S K Y -> not ending T.

"" MUSHY""? M excluded.

"" PUSSY""? P excluded and not ending T.

"" WUSHU""? Not.

"" VISIT"" seems a good candidate.

Another one: ""VISIT"" or ""EXIST"" but E excluded.

""WHIST"": W H I S T -> but I at position 3? WHIST: W H I S T -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> but we need I at position 4? Here I is at 3, which is forbidden, and S at 4, which is also forbidden? From MOIST, S at position 4 was wrong, so S cannot be at 4. In WHIST, S is at position 4? So invalid.

Similarly, ""WAIST"": W A I S T -> A excluded.

""JOIST"": J O I S T -> O excluded.

""FOIST"": F O I S T -> O excluded.

So ""VISIT"" is a possibility.

But in ""VISIT"", we have:
- Position 1: V (new)
- Position 2: I (we know I is in the word, but is it at position 2? We don't know)
- Position 3: S (which is in the word, and position 3 is a candidate for S)
- Position 4: I (correct, fixed)
- Position 5: T (correct, fixed)

If we guess ""VISIT"", we can get feedback on V, I at position 2, and S at position 3.

But we also have a duplicate I? The word has two I's? In VISIT, there are two I's? V-I-S-I-T, so yes, two I's.

The feedback might be: 
- If the secret word has only one I, then the I at position 2 might be marked as absent or wrong position? But since there is an I at position 4, the I at position 2 might be marked as present but wrong position if there is another I, or absent if not.

But we don't know if there is a duplicate I.

To avoid complexity, maybe we can choose a word without duplicates.

Is there a word like ? ? S I T without duplicate and without excluded letters?

For example, with S at position 3: 
- First letter: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Second letter: similarly, but not I? Because if we put I at position 2, then it might be duplicate if the word requires only one I? But we don't know.

But in our case, we know the word has at least one I (at position 4), so if we put I at position 2, it might be an additional I.

To test, we can avoid I at position 2.

So for S at position 3, we want position 2 to be a different letter.

Examples: 
- B U S I T -> BUSIT? Not a standard word.
- D U S I T -> DUSIT? Not.
- F U S I T -> FUSIT? Not.
- G U S I T -> GUSIT? Not.
- H U S I T -> HUSIT? Not.
- J U S I T -> JUSIT? Not.
- K I S I T -> KISIT? Not, and I at position 2.
- Q U S I T -> QUSIT? Not.
- V U S I T -> VUSIT? Not.
- W U S I T -> WUSIT? Not.
- X U S I T -> XUSIT? Not.
- Y U S I T -> YUSIT? Not.
- Z U S I T -> ZUSIT? Not.

With H: H A S I T -> A excluded.

Perhaps ""SHIFT"" but I at position 3 forbidden.

Another idea: ""UNLIT"" but N and L excluded.

"" DAISY"" not ending T.

Perhaps we need to consider that S might be at position 2.

With S at position 2: [X] [S] [Y] I T

X and Y from available letters.

Examples:
- U S E I T -> E excluded.
- U S B I T -> USBIT? Not word.
- U S H I T -> USHIT? Not.
- B S M I T -> M excluded.
- D S H I T -> DSHIT? Not.
- F S K I T -> FSKIT? Not.
- G S P I T -> P excluded.
- H S M I T -> M excluded.
- J S K I T -> not.
- K S L I T -> L excluded.
- Q S U I T -> QSUIT? Not.
- V S K I T -> not.
- W S H I T -> WSHIT? Not.
- X S Y I T -> not.
- Y S T I T -> duplicate T? Y S T I T -> T at position 3 and 5? But position 5 is T, so if T is at position 3, it might be duplicate.

But ""YSTIT"" not a word.

""BESET"" E excluded.

This is difficult. 

Another common word: ""SUEDE"" E excluded.

Perhaps ""QUITE"" E excluded.

Maybe we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters, so ""VISIT"" is a valid option.

Or ""HABIT"" A excluded.

"" RABID"" R and A excluded.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words ending with ""IT"" that contain S and have no excluded letters.

Excluded letters: A, C, E, M, N, O, R, P, L.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Words ending with ""IT"":
- From dictionary, common ones: 
  - HABIT: H A B I T -> A excluded.
  - RABIT: R and A excluded.
  - BIT: 3 letters.
  - COMMIT: C, O, M excluded.
  - ADMIT: A, M excluded.
  - SUBMIT: S U B M I T -> M excluded.
  - TRANSMIT: too long.
  - LIMIT: L, I at position 2? L I M I T -> L and M excluded.
  - VISIT: V I S I T -> letters: V, I, S, I, T. V is allowed, I and S are in, T in. But has two I's. And positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T. 
    - S is at position 3, which is allowed (since S can be at 2 or 3).
    - I at position 2: this is an additional I? The secret word has I at position 4, so if it has another I at position 2, then it's fine. If not, then I at position 2 might be wrong.
  - EXIT: E excluded.
  - UNZIP: not ending IT.
  - FRUIT: F R U I T -> R excluded.
  - SUIT: 4 letters.
  - QUIT: 4 letters.
  - TOILET: O, E, and T not at end? T O I L E T -> not ending with IT? Ends with ET.
  - SPIRIT: S P I R I T -> P and R excluded.
  - AUDIT: A, U, D? A U D I T -> A excluded.
  - CREDIT: C, R, E excluded.
  - EDIT: E excluded.
  - MERIT: M, E, R excluded.
  - INUIT: I N U I T -> N excluded.
  - OPPOSIT: O, P, not 5.
  - POSIT: P, O excluded.
  - REWRIT: E, R.
  - TACIT: A, C excluded.
  - UNFIT: U N F I T -> N excluded.
  - VOMIT: O, M excluded.
  - WOVEN: not ending IT.

So from this, ""VISIT"" is the only common word I can think of.

Perhaps ""BUSKY"" not ending IT.

Or ""CUSHY"" C excluded.

So likely, the word is ""VISIT"" or a less common word.

Another possibility: ""DUVET"" not ending IT.

Perhaps ""GUILD"" not ending IT.

We might have to guess ""VISIT"".

But let's see the feedback from previous guesses.

In guess 2, MOIST had I at position 3 marked as present but wrong position. But in the secret word, I is at position 4, so that's consistent. Also, S at position 4 was wrong, and in the secret, position 4 is I, so S is elsewhere.

In guess 3, SPLIT had S at position 1 marked as present but wrong position, so S is not at 1.

So S must be at position 2 or 3.

If we guess ""VISIT"", we put S at position 3, which is a candidate.

Also, we put I at position 2, which might be present or not.

If the secret word is ""VISIT"", then it has two I's.

If not, it might be a word with S at position 2 and no I at position 2.

But we are struggling to find such a word.

Another word: ""WHIST"" but O excluded? WHIST is W H I S T, but I at position 3 and S at position 4, both of which are forbidden positions? Position 3 for I is forbidden, position 4 for S is forbidden.

So not.

""SHIST"" not common.

Perhaps ""SUQ"" not 5.

I think ""VISIT"" is our best bet.

Or ""BEGIT"" not a word.

So I will go with ""VISIT"".

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the secret is not VISIT.

Suppose the secret has S at position 2, then it would be ? S ? I T.

For example, if it's ""USNIT"" not word, or ""BSMIT"" not.

Perhaps it's ""CUSP"" not ending IT.

I think we have to guess ""VISIT"".

So next guess: VISIT.

But in the feedback, for VISIT, we would have:
- V at position 1: if absent or present?
- I at position 2: if present and correct, or present but wrong position, or absent?
- S at position 3: similarly.
- I at position 4: correct.
- T at position 5: correct.

But since position 4 and 5 are fixed, we only care about 1,2,3.

If we guess VISIT and the secret is not VISIT, we might get information.

For example, if S is at position 2, then in VISIT, S is at position 3, so it would be marked as absent? Or present but wrong position? Since S is in the word, if it's not at position 3, it would be marked as present but wrong position (-).

Similarly for other letters.

So it could work.

Perhaps there is a word like ""HUSK"" not 5.

Another idea: ""DUSTY"" not ending T.

I think we should go with ""VISIT"".

So guess: VISIT

But let's see if there's a better guess that tests more letters.

For example, we could guess a word that has S at position 2 or 3 and uses new letters.

But with the fixed IT at the end, it's hard.

Guess: for example, ""BUSHY"" not ending T.

Or ""FISHY"" not ending T.

Perhaps ""SWIFT"" but I at position 3 forbidden.

I think ""VISIT"" is the most reasonable.

So I'll go with that.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
