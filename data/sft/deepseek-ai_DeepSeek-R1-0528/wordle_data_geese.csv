We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

 Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Since E is in the 5th position, we know the word pattern is: _ _ _ _ E

 We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
 1. Ends with E? Not necessarily, because we already know the last letter is E, but we can use this to test other letters.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word).
 3. Includes other common letters to gather more information.

 However, note that the feedback for E is a check (✓), meaning it is in the correct position. So in our next guess, we can keep E at the end to maintain that known position and test other letters in the first four positions.

 But we don't have to keep E at the end? Actually, we can, because we know it's fixed. However, if we don't, we might get information about other positions. But since we know E is at the end, it's efficient to keep it there and focus on the first four letters.

 So, let's look for a word that ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We also want to include common vowels and consonants that we haven't tested. The remaining vowels are: I, O, U (and sometimes Y). Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we have only one known letter (E at the end), we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, etc.

 Let's consider words ending in E that use common letters and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Some possibilities: 
 - ""SLATE"": but A is already known to be absent, so skip.
 - ""POISE"": contains O, I, S, P and ends with E. And none of these are in the excluded list (C, R, A, N). So that's a candidate.
 - ""MOUSE"": contains M, O, U, S, E. Also avoids the excluded letters.

 However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more letters.

 Another idea: since we know the last letter, we can focus on the first four. We can try a word that has E at the end and uses four new letters.

 Let's choose ""POISE"": 
   P, O, I, S, E (with E at the end)

 But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""POISE"" is a valid English word.

 Alternatively, we could use ""QUITE"" but Q is less common and we have U, which might not be necessary. Also, we want to avoid using too many rare letters.

 Another common word: ""SPIKE"" - but we don't know if K is in the word. However, it's acceptable.

 However, note that we have not tested the letter T. T is a very common letter.

 Let me think of words ending in E that include T and other common letters.

 Example: ""STOLE"" - but S, T, O, L, E. However, we don't know if S, T, O, L are in the word. But note: we have to avoid A, R, C, N? Yes, and STOLE doesn't have any of those.

 But wait, in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we got E correct. So the word has E at the end and does not have C, R, A, N.

 However, ""STOLE"" has S, T, O, L, E. All new letters.

 But we have to consider that the first guess had E at the 5th position and we are keeping that. So ""STOLE"" would be: S T O L E.

 However, we must avoid the letters that were absent: C, R, A, N. ""STOLE"" avoids these.

 Alternatively, we can use ""STYLE"" or ""SPITE"", but let's go with a word that has more common letters.

 Another option: ""HOUSE"" - H, O, U, S, E. But U is less common? Actually, it's okay.

 However, I think ""POISE"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and I) and two consonants (P and S). But let's compare with ""STOLE"": 
   ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> covers S, T, O, L (all common) and we already know E.

 But note: we are not required to use the known position? Actually, we can, but it's beneficial to keep the known letter to get more information about the other positions.

 However, if we don't fix the E, we might get information about whether E appears elsewhere? But the feedback for the first guess only showed E at the last position. It's possible that E appears only once? Actually, the rules don't specify, but typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? But in this case, we don't know.

 But to be safe, we can assume that the word might have repeated letters? However, the feedback for the first guess didn't show any other E, but then again, we only had one E. So we don't know.

 Since we have limited tries, it's efficient to keep the known E at the end and test the other positions.

 So, I will choose a word that ends with E and uses four new letters.

 Let me list a few: 
   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E
   ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E
   ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E
   ""WHITE"" -> W, H, I, T, E

 I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate because it has very common letters: S, T, O, L.

 Alternatively, ""SLIME"" -> but L, I, M, E? But we have S? Wait, ""SLIME"" has S, L, I, M, E. But we haven't tested M? It's okay.

 However, we must avoid A, R, C, N. All these words do.

 But note: we are on the second guess, so we want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is in the word.

 Since we don't have any information about the first four letters, we are shooting in the dark.

 I think ""STOLE"" is a solid choice.

 However, let me check: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 I'll go with ""STOLE"".

 But wait, what about the letter T? It's very common. And S is also common.

 Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"", but I think ""STOLE"" is better.

 Another common word: ""TABLE"" -> but A is already excluded, so we cannot use A.

 So, avoiding A, R, C, N, we have limited options.

 Let me think of more words: 
   ""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E
   ""GUISE"" -> G, U, I, S, E
   ""PLUME"" -> P, L, U, M, E

 But I think ""STOLE"" is a good balance of common letters.

 Therefore, I choose ""STOLE"" as the next guess.

<guess>stole</guess>

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked `x`).
- **E** is in the word and in the **correct position** (5th letter, marked `✓`).

This means:
- The secret word ends with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).
- The word contains **none** of the letters C, R, A, or N.

For the next guess:
- We must preserve the known **E** in the 5th position to maintain the confirmed letter.
- We need to test new, common letters to gather more information about the first four positions.
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.

A strong second guess is **""STOLE""** because:
- It ends with **E**, fitting the known pattern.
- It introduces four new common letters: **S, T, O, L**.
- None of these letters (S, T, O, L) were previously tested or excluded.
- ""STOLE"" is a valid English word that maximizes coverage of frequent consonants and vowels.

 So, I will choose a word that ends with E and uses four new letters.

 Let me list a few: 
   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E
   ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E
   ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E
   ""WHITE"" -> W, H, I, T, E

 I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate because it has very common letters: S, T, O, L.

 Alternatively, ""SLIME"" -> but L, I, M, E? But we have S? Wait, ""SLIME"" has S, L, I, M, E. But we haven't tested M? It's okay.

 However, we must avoid A, R, C, N. All these words do.

 But note: we are on the second guess, so we want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is in the word.

 Since we don't have any information about the first four letters, we are shooting in the dark.

 I think ""STOLE"" is a solid choice.

 However, let me check: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 I'll go with ""STOLE"".

 But wait, what about the letter T? It's very common. And S is also common.

 Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"", but I think ""STOLE"" is better.

 Another common word: ""TABLE"" -> but A is already excluded, so we cannot use A.

 So, avoiding A, R, C, N, we have limited options.

 Let me think of more words: 
   ""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E
   ""GUISE"" -> G, U, I, S, E
   ""PLUME"" -> P, L, U, M, E

 But I think ""STOLE"" is a good balance of common letters.

 Therefore, I choose ""STOLE"" as the next guess.

<guess>stole</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked `x`).
- **E** is in the word and in the **correct position** (5th letter, marked `✓`).

This means:
- The secret word ends with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).
- The word contains **none** of the letters C, R, A, or N.

For the next guess:
- We must preserve the known **E** in the 5th position to maintain the confirmed letter.
- We need to test new, common letters to gather more information about the first four positions.
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.

A strong second guess is **""STOLE""** because:
- It ends with **E**, fitting the known pattern.
- It introduces four new common letters: **S, T, O, L**.
- None of these letters (S, T, O, L) were previously tested or excluded.
- ""STOLE"" is a valid English word that maximizes coverage of frequent consonants and vowels.

We have feedback from two guesses.
First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
This tells us:
- The secret word has E as the fifth letter.
- The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Second guess: ""stole"" -> S(-), T(x), O(x), L(x), E(✓)
Interpretation:
- S is in the word but not in the first position (since in ""stole"", S is the first letter, and feedback is ""-"" meaning it's present but not here).
- T is not in the word (so we add T to the exclusion list).
- O is not in the word.
- L is not in the word.
- E is in the correct position (fifth).

So now we know:
- The secret word ends with E: pattern _ _ _ _ E
- Contained letters: E and S (but S is not in position 1).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, O, L

We also know S is somewhere in the word but not in the first position.

So the secret word has:
- Exactly the letters: S and E, plus three other letters that are not C, R, A, N, T, O, L.
- The positions: position 5 is E, position 1 is not S.

We need to guess a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (so position 5 is E)
- Contains S (but not in position 1)
- Uses only letters not excluded: available letters are from the alphabet excluding C,R,A,N,T,O,L.
The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and S (which we know is in).

But note: we don't know the other three letters, so the word must include S and E, and three others from the remaining.

We need to try a word that satisfies these constraints and uses common letters to narrow down.

Common letters left: H, M, P, U, B, D, F, G, I, K, etc.

We also don't know the position of S. Since it's not in position 1, it must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4.

We are going to guess a word that:
- Has E at the end.
- Contains S in position 2, 3, or 4 (not 1).
- Avoids C,R,A,N,T,O,L.

Possible words:
- We could try S in position 2: e.g., ? S ? ? E
- Or position 3: ? ? S ? E
- Or position 4: ? ? ? S E

Given we have limited information, let's list some candidate words that fit.

Since we need to test more letters, we should choose a word with letters that are common and we haven't tried.

Let's think of words ending in E that contain S and avoid the excluded letters.

For example, ""PUSHE"" — wait, that might not be a word. Push is 4 letters. How about ""PURSE""? But R is excluded? R is excluded from the first guess (crane -> R(x)).

""PURSE"": contains R, which is excluded. So no.

""HOUSE"": contains O and S. O is excluded? Second guess ""stole"" had O(x), so O is not in the word. So ""HOUSE"" has O -> invalid because O is excluded.

""MUSIC"": but doesn't end with E? We need to end with E.

""SHINE"": let's check letters: S,H,I,N,E -> but N is excluded (from crane: N(x)). So ""SHINE"" has N -> excluded.

""WHOSE"": has O and E? But O is excluded.

""PHASE"": excludes A? A is excluded from first guess? Yes, A(x). So ""A"" is excluded.

""QUEST"": has Q, U, E, S, T. But T is excluded? From second guess: T(x). So T is excluded -> ""QUEST"" has T -> invalid.

""BIKES"": ends with S, not E? We need E at the end.

Let's think of words that end in E and contain S.

Some possibilities:
- ""PURSE"": but has R -> excluded.
- ""NOISE"": has N and O -> both excluded.
- ""RAISE"": has R and A -> excluded.
- ""MOUSE"": has O -> excluded.

We need to avoid the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,T,O,L.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

And we know S must be in the word.

Let me try ""QUIET"": ends with T, but we need E at the end? ""QUIET"" ends with T? No, QUIET is Q-U-I-E-T -> not ending with E? And T is excluded.

What about ""SUITE""? S,U,I,T,E -> but T is excluded -> invalid.

""SPIKE"": S,P,I,K,E -> check excluded: S is allowed (we know it must be in), P not excluded, I not excluded, K not excluded, E known. And we don't have any excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,T,O,L. None of P,I,K are excluded? That's true.

But ""SPIKE"" contains S and E? Yes. And S is in position 1? But in the second guess, we learned S is not in position 1? So we must avoid putting S in position 1.

In ""SPIKE"", S is the first letter. But we know from the second guess feedback that S is not in position 1 because in ""stole"" S was in position 1 and we got S(-) meaning S is in the word but not in position 1.

Therefore, putting S in position 1 again would be incorrect because we know it's not there, and we'd probably get the same feedback.

So we need a word with S not in position 1 and the word ends with E.

In ""SPIKE"", if we use it, we would have S in position 1 -> bad.

So we need a word that has S in position 2, 3, or 4.

Let me try ""DIESE""? Not a common word. ""HIVES""? H,I,V,E,S -> ends with S? No.

""GUISE"": G,U,I,S,E -> ends with E? Yes: G-U-I-S-E -> positions: G1, U2, I3, S4, E5.

Check letters: G, U, I, S, E. Excluded letters? G: not excluded, U: not excluded, I: not excluded, S: ok, E: ok. And avoided C,R,A,N,T,O,L.

So ""GUISE"" is a valid word? Guise means appearance, so yes.

Now, S is in position 4, which is acceptable because we know S is not in position 1, but it can be in 4.

Another candidate: ""BIKES"" ends with S? No, we need E at the end. ""BIKE"" is 4 letters? ""Bikes"" is plural? But we need 5 letters. ""BIKES"" is S at the end? We need E at the end, so not.

""TIMES"": has T -> excluded.

""SHIRE"": has R and E -> R excluded? Yes.

""SUGAR"": no E at end.

Perhaps ""PIXIE"": P,I,X,I,E -> has two I? And ends with E. Letters: P,I,X,E. No S? We must include S because it is in the word. We cannot omit S.

Our guess must include S because we know S is in the word? Not necessarily, but if we omit S, then we lose the chance to get more info about S. We know S is present, but we don't know its position. So to narrow down, we should include S.

So ""PIXIE"" has no S -> not good.

""SPITE"": ends with E? S-P-I-T-E -> but T is excluded, and S in first position -> not allowed.

How about ""SIEVE"": S,I,E,V,E -> but E is repeated? Note: the word SIEVE has two E's. But our feedback so far hasn't indicated repeated letters? We don't know. This is acceptable? But in SIEVE, position 1 is S -> which we know is wrong. But wait, we know S is not in position 1, so we shouldn't put S in position 1.

In ""SIEVE"", S is position 1 -> avoid.

So we need a word where S is not in position 1 and the word ends with E.

More candidates:
- ""QUIET"": not ends with E? QUIET ends with T? Actually, ""QUIET"" is Q-U-I-E-T -> not E as last character? The last letter is T.

Perhaps ""SUGAR"" is 5 letters but ends with R.

Another idea: ""JUICE"": has C? C excluded -> no.

""BEIGE"": B,E,I,G,E -> two E? But it's B-E-I-G-E -> ends with E. But no S -> must include S? So not.

We need to include S.

""VISES"": ends with S? V-I-S-E-S -> not E at end.

""VISE"" is 4 letters? ""VISES"" plural? But not ends with E.

""GUISE"" seems a valid choice: spelled G-U-I-S-E, so E at end, and S at position 4.

Another word: ""NOISE"" has O and N -> excluded.

""PRISM"": doesn't end with E.

""SHAME"": has A? A excluded -> no.

So ""GUISE"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""SIEGE"": S,I,E,G,E? ""SIEGE"" is S-I-E-G-E -> ends with E? No, ends with E? S-I-E-G-E -> that's 5 letters? Positions: S1, I2, E3, G4, E5? So it ends with E. But S is position 1 -> which we know is not correct? Because the second guess had S in position 1 and got S(-), meaning S is not in position 1. So we cannot use ""SIEGE"" because it puts S in position 1.

Similarly, we need S in 2,3, or 4.

Another word: ""GIVES"": G,I,V,E,S -> ends with S? We need E at end.

""WISE"" is 4 letters? ""WISER"" ends with R, not E.

""USURE"" — not a word.

""AMUSE"": has A and M? A is excluded -> no.

""EXIST"": ends with T, not E.

""POSSE"": ends with E? P-O-S-S-E -> but O is excluded? O is excluded -> invalid.

""KIOSE"" — not a word.

""GUISE"" may be our best option.

Another possibility: ""PUISE""? Doesn't seem common. ""BRISE""? But B,R? R is excluded.

""SHIVE"": S,H,I,V,E? V is fine? Then S-H-I-V-E -> ends with E? Yes, and S in position 1 -> invalid.

Unless we rearrange... but we are guessing a word, so we cannot rearrange arbitrarily.

How about ""HIVED""? Ends with D? No.

""FUSED"": ends with D? Not E.

""QUITS"": ends with S.

I think ""GUISE"" is acceptable.

But to confirm: 
- It uses G, U, I, S, E.
- Allowed: none of these are in {C,R,A,N,T,O,L}.
- S is in position 4 (not 1).
- Word is valid.

Another candidate: ""SUHUE""? Not a word.

""SUITE"": has T -> excluded.

""DUVET"": has T? D-U-V-E-T -> ends with T? Not E.

""BEVUE""? Uncommon.

So I'll go with ""GUISE"".

But we also want to test common letters? We haven't tried H, M, P, etc.

Another candidate: ""PHISH""? But doesn't end with E. ""PHASE"" has A -> excluded.

""WHOSE"" has O -> excluded.

""SHINE"" has N -> excluded.

""SPIRE"" has R -> excluded.

I think ""GUISE"" is a good choice to test U and I, while placing S in a different position.

There is also ""GISED""? Not common.

So let's guess ""GUISE"".

Feedback will tell us about the position of S and whether G, U, I are in the word.

But note: we are constrained by having E at the end and S somewhere.

So step-by-step:

Word must be: ? ? ? ? E
Must include S (in position 2,3, or 4)
Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, O, L
Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We are guessing ""GUISE"": G1, U2, I3, S4, E5

If G is in the word and correct position? Position 1: if G is in the word, then if it's in position 1, we might get ✓ for G. If it's in the word but wrong position, we get -. Otherwise x.

Similarly for U in position 2, I in position 3, S in position 4 (and we know E is ✓ in position 5).

If we get feedback that S is -, then S is in the word but not in position 4? But we know S is in the word, just not position 1. So if we guess S in position 4 and it is -, then S is not in position 4, meaning it must be in 2 or 3.

Similarly we learn about G, U, I.

This gives us a lot of information.

Therefore, I choose ""GUISE"".

<guess>guise</guess>
</think>
After reviewing the feedback:
- **E** is confirmed in the 5th position.
- **S** is in the word but not in position 1.
- Excluded letters (**not** in the secret word): **C, R, A, N, T, O, L**.

This means:
- The secret word pattern is `_ _ _ _ E`.
- The word contains **S**, located in position 2, 3, or 4.
- We must avoid excluded letters and prioritize common unused consonants like G, U, I, etc.

For the third guess, **""GUISE""** is ideal because:
- It preserves **E** in the 5th position.
- Places **S** in position 4 (testing a new spot and avoiding position 1).
- Uses new common letters (**G, U, I**), none of which are excluded.
- It’s a valid English word that maximizes information gain about remaining positions.

<guess>guise</guess>",guise,"We have feedback from two guesses.
First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
This tells us:
- The secret word has E as the fifth letter.
- The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Second guess: ""stole"" -> S(-), T(x), O(x), L(x), E(✓)
Interpretation:
- S is in the word but not in the first position (since in ""stole"", S is the first letter, and feedback is ""-"" meaning it's present but not here).
- T is not in the word (so we add T to the exclusion list).
- O is not in the word.
- L is not in the word.
- E is in the correct position (fifth).

So now we know:
- The secret word ends with E: pattern _ _ _ _ E
- Contained letters: E and S (but S is not in position 1).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, O, L

We also know S is somewhere in the word but not in the first position.

So the secret word has:
- Exactly the letters: S and E, plus three other letters that are not C, R, A, N, T, O, L.
- The positions: position 5 is E, position 1 is not S.

We need to guess a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (so position 5 is E)
- Contains S (but not in position 1)
- Uses only letters not excluded: available letters are from the alphabet excluding C,R,A,N,T,O,L.
The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and S (which we know is in).

But note: we don't know the other three letters, so the word must include S and E, and three others from the remaining.

We need to try a word that satisfies these constraints and uses common letters to narrow down.

Common letters left: H, M, P, U, B, D, F, G, I, K, etc.

We also don't know the position of S. Since it's not in position 1, it must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4.

We are going to guess a word that:
- Has E at the end.
- Contains S in position 2, 3, or 4 (not 1).
- Avoids C,R,A,N,T,O,L.

Possible words:
- We could try S in position 2: e.g., ? S ? ? E
- Or position 3: ? ? S ? E
- Or position 4: ? ? ? S E

Given we have limited information, let's list some candidate words that fit.

Since we need to test more letters, we should choose a word with letters that are common and we haven't tried.

Let's think of words ending in E that contain S and avoid the excluded letters.

For example, ""PUSHE"" — wait, that might not be a word. Push is 4 letters. How about ""PURSE""? But R is excluded? R is excluded from the first guess (crane -> R(x)).

""PURSE"": contains R, which is excluded. So no.

""HOUSE"": contains O and S. O is excluded? Second guess ""stole"" had O(x), so O is not in the word. So ""HOUSE"" has O -> invalid because O is excluded.

""MUSIC"": but doesn't end with E? We need to end with E.

""SHINE"": let's check letters: S,H,I,N,E -> but N is excluded (from crane: N(x)). So ""SHINE"" has N -> excluded.

""WHOSE"": has O and E? But O is excluded.

""PHASE"": excludes A? A is excluded from first guess? Yes, A(x). So ""A"" is excluded.

""QUEST"": has Q, U, E, S, T. But T is excluded? From second guess: T(x). So T is excluded -> ""QUEST"" has T -> invalid.

""BIKES"": ends with S, not E? We need E at the end.

Let's think of words that end in E and contain S.

Some possibilities:
- ""PURSE"": but has R -> excluded.
- ""NOISE"": has N and O -> both excluded.
- ""RAISE"": has R and A -> excluded.
- ""MOUSE"": has O -> excluded.

We need to avoid the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,T,O,L.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

And we know S must be in the word.

Let me try ""QUIET"": ends with T, but we need E at the end? ""QUIET"" ends with T? No, QUIET is Q-U-I-E-T -> not ending with E? And T is excluded.

What about ""SUITE""? S,U,I,T,E -> but T is excluded -> invalid.

""SPIKE"": S,P,I,K,E -> check excluded: S is allowed (we know it must be in), P not excluded, I not excluded, K not excluded, E known. And we don't have any excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,T,O,L. None of P,I,K are excluded? That's true.

But ""SPIKE"" contains S and E? Yes. And S is in position 1? But in the second guess, we learned S is not in position 1? So we must avoid putting S in position 1.

In ""SPIKE"", S is the first letter. But we know from the second guess feedback that S is not in position 1 because in ""stole"" S was in position 1 and we got S(-) meaning S is in the word but not in position 1.

Therefore, putting S in position 1 again would be incorrect because we know it's not there, and we'd probably get the same feedback.

So we need a word with S not in position 1 and the word ends with E.

In ""SPIKE"", if we use it, we would have S in position 1 -> bad.

So we need a word that has S in position 2, 3, or 4.

Let me try ""DIESE""? Not a common word. ""HIVES""? H,I,V,E,S -> ends with S? No.

""GUISE"": G,U,I,S,E -> ends with E? Yes: G-U-I-S-E -> positions: G1, U2, I3, S4, E5.

Check letters: G, U, I, S, E. Excluded letters? G: not excluded, U: not excluded, I: not excluded, S: ok, E: ok. And avoided C,R,A,N,T,O,L.

So ""GUISE"" is a valid word? Guise means appearance, so yes.

Now, S is in position 4, which is acceptable because we know S is not in position 1, but it can be in 4.

Another candidate: ""BIKES"" ends with S? No, we need E at the end. ""BIKE"" is 4 letters? ""Bikes"" is plural? But we need 5 letters. ""BIKES"" is S at the end? We need E at the end, so not.

""TIMES"": has T -> excluded.

""SHIRE"": has R and E -> R excluded? Yes.

""SUGAR"": no E at end.

Perhaps ""PIXIE"": P,I,X,I,E -> has two I? And ends with E. Letters: P,I,X,E. No S? We must include S because it is in the word. We cannot omit S.

Our guess must include S because we know S is in the word? Not necessarily, but if we omit S, then we lose the chance to get more info about S. We know S is present, but we don't know its position. So to narrow down, we should include S.

So ""PIXIE"" has no S -> not good.

""SPITE"": ends with E? S-P-I-T-E -> but T is excluded, and S in first position -> not allowed.

How about ""SIEVE"": S,I,E,V,E -> but E is repeated? Note: the word SIEVE has two E's. But our feedback so far hasn't indicated repeated letters? We don't know. This is acceptable? But in SIEVE, position 1 is S -> which we know is wrong. But wait, we know S is not in position 1, so we shouldn't put S in position 1.

In ""SIEVE"", S is position 1 -> avoid.

So we need a word where S is not in position 1 and the word ends with E.

More candidates:
- ""QUIET"": not ends with E? QUIET ends with T? Actually, ""QUIET"" is Q-U-I-E-T -> not E as last character? The last letter is T.

Perhaps ""SUGAR"" is 5 letters but ends with R.

Another idea: ""JUICE"": has C? C excluded -> no.

""BEIGE"": B,E,I,G,E -> two E? But it's B-E-I-G-E -> ends with E. But no S -> must include S? So not.

We need to include S.

""VISES"": ends with S? V-I-S-E-S -> not E at end.

""VISE"" is 4 letters? ""VISES"" plural? But not ends with E.

""GUISE"" seems a valid choice: spelled G-U-I-S-E, so E at end, and S at position 4.

Another word: ""NOISE"" has O and N -> excluded.

""PRISM"": doesn't end with E.

""SHAME"": has A? A excluded -> no.

So ""GUISE"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""SIEGE"": S,I,E,G,E? ""SIEGE"" is S-I-E-G-E -> ends with E? No, ends with E? S-I-E-G-E -> that's 5 letters? Positions: S1, I2, E3, G4, E5? So it ends with E. But S is position 1 -> which we know is not correct? Because the second guess had S in position 1 and got S(-), meaning S is not in position 1. So we cannot use ""SIEGE"" because it puts S in position 1.

Similarly, we need S in 2,3, or 4.

Another word: ""GIVES"": G,I,V,E,S -> ends with S? We need E at end.

""WISE"" is 4 letters? ""WISER"" ends with R, not E.

""USURE"" — not a word.

""AMUSE"": has A and M? A is excluded -> no.

""EXIST"": ends with T, not E.

""POSSE"": ends with E? P-O-S-S-E -> but O is excluded? O is excluded -> invalid.

""KIOSE"" — not a word.

""GUISE"" may be our best option.

Another possibility: ""PUISE""? Doesn't seem common. ""BRISE""? But B,R? R is excluded.

""SHIVE"": S,H,I,V,E? V is fine? Then S-H-I-V-E -> ends with E? Yes, and S in position 1 -> invalid.

Unless we rearrange... but we are guessing a word, so we cannot rearrange arbitrarily.

How about ""HIVED""? Ends with D? No.

""FUSED"": ends with D? Not E.

""QUITS"": ends with S.

I think ""GUISE"" is acceptable.

But to confirm: 
- It uses G, U, I, S, E.
- Allowed: none of these are in {C,R,A,N,T,O,L}.
- S is in position 4 (not 1).
- Word is valid.

Another candidate: ""SUHUE""? Not a word.

""SUITE"": has T -> excluded.

""DUVET"": has T? D-U-V-E-T -> ends with T? Not E.

""BEVUE""? Uncommon.

So I'll go with ""GUISE"".

But we also want to test common letters? We haven't tried H, M, P, etc.

Another candidate: ""PHISH""? But doesn't end with E. ""PHASE"" has A -> excluded.

""WHOSE"" has O -> excluded.

""SHINE"" has N -> excluded.

""SPIRE"" has R -> excluded.

I think ""GUISE"" is a good choice to test U and I, while placing S in a different position.

There is also ""GISED""? Not common.

So let's guess ""GUISE"".

Feedback will tell us about the position of S and whether G, U, I are in the word.

But note: we are constrained by having E at the end and S somewhere.

So step-by-step:

Word must be: ? ? ? ? E
Must include S (in position 2,3, or 4)
Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, O, L
Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We are guessing ""GUISE"": G1, U2, I3, S4, E5

If G is in the word and correct position? Position 1: if G is in the word, then if it's in position 1, we might get ✓ for G. If it's in the word but wrong position, we get -. Otherwise x.

Similarly for U in position 2, I in position 3, S in position 4 (and we know E is ✓ in position 5).

If we get feedback that S is -, then S is in the word but not in position 4? But we know S is in the word, just not position 1. So if we guess S in position 4 and it is -, then S is not in position 4, meaning it must be in 2 or 3.

Similarly we learn about G, U, I.

This gives us a lot of information.

Therefore, I choose ""GUISE"".

<guess>guise</guess>After reviewing the feedback:
- **E** is confirmed in the 5th position.
- **S** is in the word but not in position 1.
- Excluded letters (**not** in the secret word): **C, R, A, N, T, O, L**.

This means:
- The secret word pattern is `_ _ _ _ E`.
- The word contains **S**, located in position 2, 3, or 4.
- We must avoid excluded letters and prioritize common unused consonants like G, U, I, etc.

For the third guess, **""GUISE""** is ideal because:
- It preserves **E** in the 5th position.
- Places **S** in position 4 (testing a new spot and avoiding position 1).
- Uses new common letters (**G, U, I**), none of which are excluded.
- It’s a valid English word that maximizes information gain about remaining positions.",Guess 3: guise -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) U(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,geese,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

 Therefore, the secret word ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, or N.

 Since E is in the 5th position, we know the word pattern is: _ _ _ _ E

 We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
 1. Ends with E? Not necessarily, because we already know the last letter is E, but we can use this to test other letters.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word).
 3. Includes other common letters to gather more information.

 However, note that the feedback for E is a check (✓), meaning it is in the correct position. So in our next guess, we can keep E at the end to maintain that known position and test other letters in the first four positions.

 But we don't have to keep E at the end? Actually, we can, because we know it's fixed. However, if we don't, we might get information about other positions. But since we know E is at the end, it's efficient to keep it there and focus on the first four letters.

 So, let's look for a word that ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We also want to include common vowels and consonants that we haven't tested. The remaining vowels are: I, O, U (and sometimes Y). Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we have only one known letter (E at the end), we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, etc.

 Let's consider words ending in E that use common letters and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Some possibilities: 
 - ""SLATE"": but A is already known to be absent, so skip.
 - ""POISE"": contains O, I, S, P and ends with E. And none of these are in the excluded list (C, R, A, N). So that's a candidate.
 - ""MOUSE"": contains M, O, U, S, E. Also avoids the excluded letters.

 However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more letters.

 Another idea: since we know the last letter, we can focus on the first four. We can try a word that has E at the end and uses four new letters.

 Let's choose ""POISE"": 
   P, O, I, S, E (with E at the end)

 But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""POISE"" is a valid English word.

 Alternatively, we could use ""QUITE"" but Q is less common and we have U, which might not be necessary. Also, we want to avoid using too many rare letters.

 Another common word: ""SPIKE"" - but we don't know if K is in the word. However, it's acceptable.

 However, note that we have not tested the letter T. T is a very common letter.

 Let me think of words ending in E that include T and other common letters.

 Example: ""STOLE"" - but S, T, O, L, E. However, we don't know if S, T, O, L are in the word. But note: we have to avoid A, R, C, N? Yes, and STOLE doesn't have any of those.

 But wait, in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we got E correct. So the word has E at the end and does not have C, R, A, N.

 However, ""STOLE"" has S, T, O, L, E. All new letters.

 But we have to consider that the first guess had E at the 5th position and we are keeping that. So ""STOLE"" would be: S T O L E.

 However, we must avoid the letters that were absent: C, R, A, N. ""STOLE"" avoids these.

 Alternatively, we can use ""STYLE"" or ""SPITE"", but let's go with a word that has more common letters.

 Another option: ""HOUSE"" - H, O, U, S, E. But U is less common? Actually, it's okay.

 However, I think ""POISE"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and I) and two consonants (P and S). But let's compare with ""STOLE"": 
   ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> covers S, T, O, L (all common) and we already know E.

 But note: we are not required to use the known position? Actually, we can, but it's beneficial to keep the known letter to get more information about the other positions.

 However, if we don't fix the E, we might get information about whether E appears elsewhere? But the feedback for the first guess only showed E at the last position. It's possible that E appears only once? Actually, the rules don't specify, but typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? But in this case, we don't know.

 But to be safe, we can assume that the word might have repeated letters? However, the feedback for the first guess didn't show any other E, but then again, we only had one E. So we don't know.

 Since we have limited tries, it's efficient to keep the known E at the end and test the other positions.

 So, I will choose a word that ends with E and uses four new letters.

 Let me list a few: 
   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E
   ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E
   ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E
   ""WHITE"" -> W, H, I, T, E

 I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate because it has very common letters: S, T, O, L.

 Alternatively, ""SLIME"" -> but L, I, M, E? But we have S? Wait, ""SLIME"" has S, L, I, M, E. But we haven't tested M? It's okay.

 However, we must avoid A, R, C, N. All these words do.

 But note: we are on the second guess, so we want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is in the word.

 Since we don't have any information about the first four letters, we are shooting in the dark.

 I think ""STOLE"" is a solid choice.

 However, let me check: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 I'll go with ""STOLE"".

 But wait, what about the letter T? It's very common. And S is also common.

 Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"", but I think ""STOLE"" is better.

 Another common word: ""TABLE"" -> but A is already excluded, so we cannot use A.

 So, avoiding A, R, C, N, we have limited options.

 Let me think of more words: 
   ""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E
   ""GUISE"" -> G, U, I, S, E
   ""PLUME"" -> P, L, U, M, E

 But I think ""STOLE"" is a good balance of common letters.

 Therefore, I choose ""STOLE"" as the next guess.

<guess>stole</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked `x`).
- **E** is in the word and in the **correct position** (5th letter, marked `✓`).

This means:
- The secret word ends with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).
- The word contains **none** of the letters C, R, A, or N.

For the next guess:
- We must preserve the known **E** in the 5th position to maintain the confirmed letter.
- We need to test new, common letters to gather more information about the first four positions.
- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.

A strong second guess is **""STOLE""** because:
- It ends with **E**, fitting the known pattern.
- It introduces four new common letters: **S, T, O, L**.
- None of these letters (S, T, O, L) were previously tested or excluded.
- ""STOLE"" is a valid English word that maximizes coverage of frequent consonants and vowels.

<guess>stole</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses.
First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
This tells us:
- The secret word has E as the fifth letter.
- The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Second guess: ""stole"" -> S(-), T(x), O(x), L(x), E(✓)
Interpretation:
- S is in the word but not in the first position (since in ""stole"", S is the first letter, and feedback is ""-"" meaning it's present but not here).
- T is not in the word (so we add T to the exclusion list).
- O is not in the word.
- L is not in the word.
- E is in the correct position (fifth).

So now we know:
- The secret word ends with E: pattern _ _ _ _ E
- Contained letters: E and S (but S is not in position 1).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, O, L

We also know S is somewhere in the word but not in the first position.

So the secret word has:
- Exactly the letters: S and E, plus three other letters that are not C, R, A, N, T, O, L.
- The positions: position 5 is E, position 1 is not S.

We need to guess a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (so position 5 is E)
- Contains S (but not in position 1)
- Uses only letters not excluded: available letters are from the alphabet excluding C,R,A,N,T,O,L.
The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and S (which we know is in).

But note: we don't know the other three letters, so the word must include S and E, and three others from the remaining.

We need to try a word that satisfies these constraints and uses common letters to narrow down.

Common letters left: H, M, P, U, B, D, F, G, I, K, etc.

We also don't know the position of S. Since it's not in position 1, it must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4.

We are going to guess a word that:
- Has E at the end.
- Contains S in position 2, 3, or 4 (not 1).
- Avoids C,R,A,N,T,O,L.

Possible words:
- We could try S in position 2: e.g., ? S ? ? E
- Or position 3: ? ? S ? E
- Or position 4: ? ? ? S E

Given we have limited information, let's list some candidate words that fit.

Since we need to test more letters, we should choose a word with letters that are common and we haven't tried.

Let's think of words ending in E that contain S and avoid the excluded letters.

For example, ""PUSHE"" — wait, that might not be a word. Push is 4 letters. How about ""PURSE""? But R is excluded? R is excluded from the first guess (crane -> R(x)).

""PURSE"": contains R, which is excluded. So no.

""HOUSE"": contains O and S. O is excluded? Second guess ""stole"" had O(x), so O is not in the word. So ""HOUSE"" has O -> invalid because O is excluded.

""MUSIC"": but doesn't end with E? We need to end with E.

""SHINE"": let's check letters: S,H,I,N,E -> but N is excluded (from crane: N(x)). So ""SHINE"" has N -> excluded.

""WHOSE"": has O and E? But O is excluded.

""PHASE"": excludes A? A is excluded from first guess? Yes, A(x). So ""A"" is excluded.

""QUEST"": has Q, U, E, S, T. But T is excluded? From second guess: T(x). So T is excluded -> ""QUEST"" has T -> invalid.

""BIKES"": ends with S, not E? We need E at the end.

Let's think of words that end in E and contain S.

Some possibilities:
- ""PURSE"": but has R -> excluded.
- ""NOISE"": has N and O -> both excluded.
- ""RAISE"": has R and A -> excluded.
- ""MOUSE"": has O -> excluded.

We need to avoid the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,T,O,L.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

And we know S must be in the word.

Let me try ""QUIET"": ends with T, but we need E at the end? ""QUIET"" ends with T? No, QUIET is Q-U-I-E-T -> not ending with E? And T is excluded.

What about ""SUITE""? S,U,I,T,E -> but T is excluded -> invalid.

""SPIKE"": S,P,I,K,E -> check excluded: S is allowed (we know it must be in), P not excluded, I not excluded, K not excluded, E known. And we don't have any excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,T,O,L. None of P,I,K are excluded? That's true.

But ""SPIKE"" contains S and E? Yes. And S is in position 1? But in the second guess, we learned S is not in position 1? So we must avoid putting S in position 1.

In ""SPIKE"", S is the first letter. But we know from the second guess feedback that S is not in position 1 because in ""stole"" S was in position 1 and we got S(-) meaning S is in the word but not in position 1.

Therefore, putting S in position 1 again would be incorrect because we know it's not there, and we'd probably get the same feedback.

So we need a word with S not in position 1 and the word ends with E.

In ""SPIKE"", if we use it, we would have S in position 1 -> bad.

So we need a word that has S in position 2, 3, or 4.

Let me try ""DIESE""? Not a common word. ""HIVES""? H,I,V,E,S -> ends with S? No.

""GUISE"": G,U,I,S,E -> ends with E? Yes: G-U-I-S-E -> positions: G1, U2, I3, S4, E5.

Check letters: G, U, I, S, E. Excluded letters? G: not excluded, U: not excluded, I: not excluded, S: ok, E: ok. And avoided C,R,A,N,T,O,L.

So ""GUISE"" is a valid word? Guise means appearance, so yes.

Now, S is in position 4, which is acceptable because we know S is not in position 1, but it can be in 4.

Another candidate: ""BIKES"" ends with S? No, we need E at the end. ""BIKE"" is 4 letters? ""Bikes"" is plural? But we need 5 letters. ""BIKES"" is S at the end? We need E at the end, so not.

""TIMES"": has T -> excluded.

""SHIRE"": has R and E -> R excluded? Yes.

""SUGAR"": no E at end.

Perhaps ""PIXIE"": P,I,X,I,E -> has two I? And ends with E. Letters: P,I,X,E. No S? We must include S because it is in the word. We cannot omit S.

Our guess must include S because we know S is in the word? Not necessarily, but if we omit S, then we lose the chance to get more info about S. We know S is present, but we don't know its position. So to narrow down, we should include S.

So ""PIXIE"" has no S -> not good.

""SPITE"": ends with E? S-P-I-T-E -> but T is excluded, and S in first position -> not allowed.

How about ""SIEVE"": S,I,E,V,E -> but E is repeated? Note: the word SIEVE has two E's. But our feedback so far hasn't indicated repeated letters? We don't know. This is acceptable? But in SIEVE, position 1 is S -> which we know is wrong. But wait, we know S is not in position 1, so we shouldn't put S in position 1.

In ""SIEVE"", S is position 1 -> avoid.

So we need a word where S is not in position 1 and the word ends with E.

More candidates:
- ""QUIET"": not ends with E? QUIET ends with T? Actually, ""QUIET"" is Q-U-I-E-T -> not E as last character? The last letter is T.

Perhaps ""SUGAR"" is 5 letters but ends with R.

Another idea: ""JUICE"": has C? C excluded -> no.

""BEIGE"": B,E,I,G,E -> two E? But it's B-E-I-G-E -> ends with E. But no S -> must include S? So not.

We need to include S.

""VISES"": ends with S? V-I-S-E-S -> not E at end.

""VISE"" is 4 letters? ""VISES"" plural? But not ends with E.

""GUISE"" seems a valid choice: spelled G-U-I-S-E, so E at end, and S at position 4.

Another word: ""NOISE"" has O and N -> excluded.

""PRISM"": doesn't end with E.

""SHAME"": has A? A excluded -> no.

So ""GUISE"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""SIEGE"": S,I,E,G,E? ""SIEGE"" is S-I-E-G-E -> ends with E? No, ends with E? S-I-E-G-E -> that's 5 letters? Positions: S1, I2, E3, G4, E5? So it ends with E. But S is position 1 -> which we know is not correct? Because the second guess had S in position 1 and got S(-), meaning S is not in position 1. So we cannot use ""SIEGE"" because it puts S in position 1.

Similarly, we need S in 2,3, or 4.

Another word: ""GIVES"": G,I,V,E,S -> ends with S? We need E at end.

""WISE"" is 4 letters? ""WISER"" ends with R, not E.

""USURE"" — not a word.

""AMUSE"": has A and M? A is excluded -> no.

""EXIST"": ends with T, not E.

""POSSE"": ends with E? P-O-S-S-E -> but O is excluded? O is excluded -> invalid.

""KIOSE"" — not a word.

""GUISE"" may be our best option.

Another possibility: ""PUISE""? Doesn't seem common. ""BRISE""? But B,R? R is excluded.

""SHIVE"": S,H,I,V,E? V is fine? Then S-H-I-V-E -> ends with E? Yes, and S in position 1 -> invalid.

Unless we rearrange... but we are guessing a word, so we cannot rearrange arbitrarily.

How about ""HIVED""? Ends with D? No.

""FUSED"": ends with D? Not E.

""QUITS"": ends with S.

I think ""GUISE"" is acceptable.

But to confirm: 
- It uses G, U, I, S, E.
- Allowed: none of these are in {C,R,A,N,T,O,L}.
- S is in position 4 (not 1).
- Word is valid.

Another candidate: ""SUHUE""? Not a word.

""SUITE"": has T -> excluded.

""DUVET"": has T? D-U-V-E-T -> ends with T? Not E.

""BEVUE""? Uncommon.

So I'll go with ""GUISE"".

But we also want to test common letters? We haven't tried H, M, P, etc.

Another candidate: ""PHISH""? But doesn't end with E. ""PHASE"" has A -> excluded.

""WHOSE"" has O -> excluded.

""SHINE"" has N -> excluded.

""SPIRE"" has R -> excluded.

I think ""GUISE"" is a good choice to test U and I, while placing S in a different position.

There is also ""GISED""? Not common.

So let's guess ""GUISE"".

Feedback will tell us about the position of S and whether G, U, I are in the word.

But note: we are constrained by having E at the end and S somewhere.

So step-by-step:

Word must be: ? ? ? ? E
Must include S (in position 2,3, or 4)
Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, O, L
Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We are guessing ""GUISE"": G1, U2, I3, S4, E5

If G is in the word and correct position? Position 1: if G is in the word, then if it's in position 1, we might get ✓ for G. If it's in the word but wrong position, we get -. Otherwise x.

Similarly for U in position 2, I in position 3, S in position 4 (and we know E is ✓ in position 5).

If we get feedback that S is -, then S is in the word but not in position 4? But we know S is in the word, just not position 1. So if we guess S in position 4 and it is -, then S is not in position 4, meaning it must be in 2 or 3.

Similarly we learn about G, U, I.

This gives us a lot of information.

Therefore, I choose ""GUISE"".

<guess>guise</guess>After reviewing the feedback:
- **E** is confirmed in the 5th position.
- **S** is in the word but not in position 1.
- Excluded letters (**not** in the secret word): **C, R, A, N, T, O, L**.

This means:
- The secret word pattern is `_ _ _ _ E`.
- The word contains **S**, located in position 2, 3, or 4.
- We must avoid excluded letters and prioritize common unused consonants like G, U, I, etc.

For the third guess, **""GUISE""** is ideal because:
- It preserves **E** in the 5th position.
- Places **S** in position 4 (testing a new spot and avoiding position 1).
- Uses new common letters (**G, U, I**), none of which are excluded.
- It’s a valid English word that maximizes information gain about remaining positions.

We should choose a word that:\n 1. Ends with E? Not necessarily, because we already know the last letter is E, but we can use this to test other letters.\n 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, N (since they are not in the word).\n 3. Includes other common letters to gather more information.\n\n However, note that the feedback for E is a check (✓), meaning it is in the correct position. So in our next guess, we can keep E at the end to maintain that known position and test other letters in the first four positions.\n\n But we don\'t have to keep E at the end? Actually, we can, because we know it\'s fixed. However, if we don\'t, we might get information about other positions. But since we know E is at the end, it\'s efficient to keep it there and focus on the first four letters.\n\n So, let\'s look for a word that ends with E and does not contain C, R, A, N.\n\n We also want to include common vowels and consonants that we haven\'t tested. The remaining vowels are: I, O, U (and sometimes Y). Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n Since we have only one known letter (E at the end), we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n Common letters in 5-letter words: S, T, L, O, etc.\n\n Let\'s consider words ending in E that use common letters and avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n Some possibilities: \n - ""SLATE"": but A is already known to be absent, so skip.\n - ""POISE"": contains O, I, S, P and ends with E. And none of these are in the excluded list (C, R, A, N). So that\'s a candidate.\n - ""MOUSE"": contains M, O, U, S, E. Also avoids the excluded letters.\n\n However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more letters.\n\n Another idea: since we know the last letter, we can focus on the first four. We can try a word that has E at the end and uses four new letters.\n\n Let\'s choose ""POISE"": \n   P, O, I, S, E (with E at the end)\n\n But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""POISE"" is a valid English word.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""QUITE"" but Q is less common and we have U, which might not be necessary. Also, we want to avoid using too many rare letters.\n\n Another common word: ""SPIKE"" - but we don\'t know if K is in the word. However, it\'s acceptable.\n\n However, note that we have not tested the letter T. T is a very common letter.\n\n Let me think of words ending in E that include T and other common letters.\n\n Example: ""STOLE"" - but S, T, O, L, E. However, we don\'t know if S, T, O, L are in the word. But note: we have to avoid A, R, C, N? Yes, and STOLE doesn\'t have any of those.\n\n But wait, in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and we got E correct. So the word has E at the end and does not have C, R, A, N.\n\n However, ""STOLE"" has S, T, O, L, E. All new letters.\n\n But we have to consider that the first guess had E at the 5th position and we are keeping that. So ""STOLE"" would be: S T O L E.\n\n However, we must avoid the letters that were absent: C, R, A, N. ""STOLE"" avoids these.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""STYLE"" or ""SPITE"", but let\'s go with a word that has more common letters.\n\n Another option: ""HOUSE"" - H, O, U, S, E. But U is less common? Actually, it\'s okay.\n\n However, I think ""POISE"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and I) and two consonants (P and S). But let\'s compare with ""STOLE"": \n   ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> covers S, T, O, L (all common) and we already know E.\n\n But note: we are not required to use the known position? Actually, we can, but it\'s beneficial to keep the known letter to get more information about the other positions.\n\n However, if we don\'t fix the E, we might get information about whether E appears elsewhere? But the feedback for the first guess only showed E at the last position. It\'s possible that E appears only once? Actually, the rules don\'t specify, but typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? But in this case, we don\'t know.\n\n But to be safe, we can assume that the word might have repeated letters? However, the feedback for the first guess didn\'t show any other E, but then again, we only had one E. So we don\'t know.\n\n Since we have limited tries, it\'s efficient to keep the known E at the end and test the other positions.\n\n So, I will choose a word that ends with E and uses four new letters.\n\n Let me list a few: \n   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E\n   ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E\n   ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E\n   ""WHITE"" -> W, H, I, T, E\n\n I think ""STOLE"" is a good candidate because it has very common letters: S, T, O, L.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLIME"" -> but L, I, M, E? But we have S? Wait, ""SLIME"" has S, L, I, M, E. But we haven\'t tested M? It\'s okay.\n\n However, we must avoid A, R, C, N. All these words do.\n\n But note: we are on the second guess, so we want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is in the word.\n\n Since we don\'t have any information about the first four letters, we are shooting in the dark.\n\n I think ""STOLE"" is a solid choice.\n\n However, let me check: the word must be 5 letters and valid.\n\n I\'ll go with ""STOLE"".\n\n But wait, what about the letter T? It\'s very common. And S is also common.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"", but I think ""STOLE"" is better.\n\n Another common word: ""TABLE"" -> but A is already excluded, so we cannot use A.\n\n So, avoiding A, R, C, N, we have limited options.\n\n Let me think of more words: \n   ""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E\n   ""GUISE"" -> G, U, I, S, E\n   ""PLUME"" -> P, L, U, M, E\n\n But I think ""STOLE"" is a good balance of common letters.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""STOLE"" as the next guess.\n\n<guess>stole</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked `x`).\n- **E** is in the word and in the **correct position** (5th letter, marked `✓`).\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word ends with **E** (pattern: `_ _ _ _ E`).\n- The word contains **none** of the letters C, R, A, or N.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- We must preserve the known **E** in the 5th position to maintain the confirmed letter.\n- We need to test new, common letters to gather more information about the first four positions.\n- Avoid using C, R, A, or N.\n\nA strong second guess is **""STOLE""** because:\n- It ends with **E**, fitting the known pattern.\n- It introduces four new common letters: **S, T, O, L**.\n- None of these letters (S, T, O, L) were previously tested or excluded.\n- ""STOLE"" is a valid English word that maximizes coverage of frequent consonants and vowels.\n\n<guess>stole</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: stole -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses.\nFirst guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(✓)\nThis tells us:\n- The secret word has E as the fifth letter.\n- The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word.\n\nSecond guess: ""stole"" -> S(-), T(x), O(x), L(x), E(✓)\nInterpretation:\n- S is in the word but not in the first position (since in ""stole"", S is the first letter, and feedback is ""-"" meaning it\'s present but not here).\n- T is not in the word (so we add T to the exclusion list).\n- O is not in the word.\n- L is not in the word.\n- E is in the correct position (fifth).\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word ends with E: pattern _ _ _ _ E\n- Contained letters: E and S (but S is not in position 1).\n- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, O, L\n\nWe also know S is somewhere in the word but not in the first position.\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- Exactly the letters: S and E, plus three other letters that are not C, R, A, N, T, O, L.\n- The positions: position 5 is E, position 1 is not S.\n\nWe need to guess a 5-letter word that:\n- Ends with E (so position 5 is E)\n- Contains S (but not in position 1)\n- Uses only letters not excluded: available letters are from the alphabet excluding C,R,A,N,T,O,L.\nThe available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and S (which we know is in).\n\nBut note: we don\'t know the other three letters, so the word must include S and E, and three others from the remaining.\n\nWe need to try a word that satisfies these constraints and uses common letters to narrow down.\n\nCommon letters left: H, M, P, U, B, D, F, G, I, K, etc.\n\nWe also don\'t know the position of S. Since it\'s not in position 1, it must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe are going to guess a word that:\n- Has E at the end.\n- Contains S in position 2, 3, or 4 (not 1).\n- Avoids C,R,A,N,T,O,L.\n\nPossible words:\n- We could try S in position 2: e.g., ? S ? ? E\n- Or position 3: ? ? S ? E\n- Or position 4: ? ? ? S E\n\nGiven we have limited information, let\'s list some candidate words that fit.\n\nSince we need to test more letters, we should choose a word with letters that are common and we haven\'t tried.\n\nLet\'s think of words ending in E that contain S and avoid the excluded letters.\n\nFor example, ""PUSHE"" — wait, that might not be a word. Push is 4 letters. How about ""PURSE""? But R is excluded? R is excluded from the first guess (crane -> R(x)).\n\n""PURSE"": contains R, which is excluded. So no.\n\n""HOUSE"": contains O and S. O is excluded? Second guess ""stole"" had O(x), so O is not in the word. So ""HOUSE"" has O -> invalid because O is excluded.\n\n""MUSIC"": but doesn\'t end with E? We need to end with E.\n\n""SHINE"": let\'s check letters: S,H,I,N,E -> but N is excluded (from crane: N(x)). So ""SHINE"" has N -> excluded.\n\n""WHOSE"": has O and E? But O is excluded.\n\n""PHASE"": excludes A? A is excluded from first guess? Yes, A(x). So ""A"" is excluded.\n\n""QUEST"": has Q, U, E, S, T. But T is excluded? From second guess: T(x). So T is excluded -> ""QUEST"" has T -> invalid.\n\n""BIKES"": ends with S, not E? We need E at the end.\n\nLet\'s think of words that end in E and contain S.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- ""PURSE"": but has R -> excluded.\n- ""NOISE"": has N and O -> both excluded.\n- ""RAISE"": has R and A -> excluded.\n- ""MOUSE"": has O -> excluded.\n\nWe need to avoid the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,T,O,L.\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nAnd we know S must be in the word.\n\nLet me try ""QUIET"": ends with T, but we need E at the end? ""QUIET"" ends with T? No, QUIET is Q-U-I-E-T -> not ending with E? And T is excluded.\n\nWhat about ""SUITE""? S,U,I,T,E -> but T is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""SPIKE"": S,P,I,K,E -> check excluded: S is allowed (we know it must be in), P not excluded, I not excluded, K not excluded, E known. And we don\'t have any excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,T,O,L. None of P,I,K are excluded? That\'s true.\n\nBut ""SPIKE"" contains S and E? Yes. And S is in position 1? But in the second guess, we learned S is not in position 1? So we must avoid putting S in position 1.\n\nIn ""SPIKE"", S is the first letter. But we know from the second guess feedback that S is not in position 1 because in ""stole"" S was in position 1 and we got S(-) meaning S is in the word but not in position 1.\n\nTherefore, putting S in position 1 again would be incorrect because we know it\'s not there, and we\'d probably get the same feedback.\n\nSo we need a word with S not in position 1 and the word ends with E.\n\nIn ""SPIKE"", if we use it, we would have S in position 1 -> bad.\n\nSo we need a word that has S in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\nLet me try ""DIESE""? Not a common word. ""HIVES""? H,I,V,E,S -> ends with S? No.\n\n""GUISE"": G,U,I,S,E -> ends with E? Yes: G-U-I-S-E -> positions: G1, U2, I3, S4, E5.\n\nCheck letters: G, U, I, S, E. Excluded letters? G: not excluded, U: not excluded, I: not excluded, S: ok, E: ok. And avoided C,R,A,N,T,O,L.\n\nSo ""GUISE"" is a valid word? Guise means appearance, so yes.\n\nNow, S is in position 4, which is acceptable because we know S is not in position 1, but it can be in 4.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BIKES"" ends with S? No, we need E at the end. ""BIKE"" is 4 letters? ""Bikes"" is plural? But we need 5 letters. ""BIKES"" is S at the end? We need E at the end, so not.\n\n""TIMES"": has T -> excluded.\n\n""SHIRE"": has R and E -> R excluded? Yes.\n\n""SUGAR"": no E at end.\n\nPerhaps ""PIXIE"": P,I,X,I,E -> has two I? And ends with E. Letters: P,I,X,E. No S? We must include S because it is in the word. We cannot omit S.\n\nOur guess must include S because we know S is in the word? Not necessarily, but if we omit S, then we lose the chance to get more info about S. We know S is present, but we don\'t know its position. So to narrow down, we should include S.\n\nSo ""PIXIE"" has no S -> not good.\n\n""SPITE"": ends with E? S-P-I-T-E -> but T is excluded, and S in first position -> not allowed.\n\nHow about ""SIEVE"": S,I,E,V,E -> but E is repeated? Note: the word SIEVE has two E\'s. But our feedback so far hasn\'t indicated repeated letters? We don\'t know. This is acceptable? But in SIEVE, position 1 is S -> which we know is wrong. But wait, we know S is not in position 1, so we shouldn\'t put S in position 1.\n\nIn ""SIEVE"", S is position 1 -> avoid.\n\nSo we need a word where S is not in position 1 and the word ends with E.\n\nMore candidates:\n- ""QUIET"": not ends with E? QUIET ends with T? Actually, ""QUIET"" is Q-U-I-E-T -> not E as last character? The last letter is T.\n\nPerhaps ""SUGAR"" is 5 letters but ends with R.\n\nAnother idea: ""JUICE"": has C? C excluded -> no.\n\n""BEIGE"": B,E,I,G,E -> two E? But it\'s B-E-I-G-E -> ends with E. But no S -> must include S? So not.\n\nWe need to include S.\n\n""VISES"": ends with S? V-I-S-E-S -> not E at end.\n\n""VISE"" is 4 letters? ""VISES"" plural? But not ends with E.\n\n""GUISE"" seems a valid choice: spelled G-U-I-S-E, so E at end, and S at position 4.\n\nAnother word: ""NOISE"" has O and N -> excluded.\n\n""PRISM"": doesn\'t end with E.\n\n""SHAME"": has A? A excluded -> no.\n\nSo ""GUISE"" is a candidate.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SIEGE"": S,I,E,G,E? ""SIEGE"" is S-I-E-G-E -> ends with E? No, ends with E? S-I-E-G-E -> that\'s 5 letters? Positions: S1, I2, E3, G4, E5? So it ends with E. But S is position 1 -> which we know is not correct? Because the second guess had S in position 1 and got S(-), meaning S is not in position 1. So we cannot use ""SIEGE"" because it puts S in position 1.\n\nSimilarly, we need S in 2,3, or 4.\n\nAnother word: ""GIVES"": G,I,V,E,S -> ends with S? We need E at end.\n\n""WISE"" is 4 letters? ""WISER"" ends with R, not E.\n\n""USURE"" — not a word.\n\n""AMUSE"": has A and M? A is excluded -> no.\n\n""EXIST"": ends with T, not E.\n\n""POSSE"": ends with E? P-O-S-S-E -> but O is excluded? O is excluded -> invalid.\n\n""KIOSE"" — not a word.\n\n""GUISE"" may be our best option.\n\nAnother possibility: ""PUISE""? Doesn\'t seem common. ""BRISE""? But B,R? R is excluded.\n\n""SHIVE"": S,H,I,V,E? V is fine? Then S-H-I-V-E -> ends with E? Yes, and S in position 1 -> invalid.\n\nUnless we rearrange... but we are guessing a word, so we cannot rearrange arbitrarily.\n\nHow about ""HIVED""? Ends with D? No.\n\n""FUSED"": ends with D? Not E.\n\n""QUITS"": ends with S.\n\nI think ""GUISE"" is acceptable.\n\nBut to confirm: \n- It uses G, U, I, S, E.\n- Allowed: none of these are in {C,R,A,N,T,O,L}.\n- S is in position 4 (not 1).\n- Word is valid.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SUHUE""? Not a word.\n\n""SUITE"": has T -> excluded.\n\n""DUVET"": has T? D-U-V-E-T -> ends with T? Not E.\n\n""BEVUE""? Uncommon.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""GUISE"".\n\nBut we also want to test common letters? We haven\'t tried H, M, P, etc.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PHISH""? But doesn\'t end with E. ""PHASE"" has A -> excluded.\n\n""WHOSE"" has O -> excluded.\n\n""SHINE"" has N -> excluded.\n\n""SPIRE"" has R -> excluded.\n\nI think ""GUISE"" is a good choice to test U and I, while placing S in a different position.\n\nThere is also ""GISED""? Not common.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""GUISE"".\n\nFeedback will tell us about the position of S and whether G, U, I are in the word.\n\nBut note: we are constrained by having E at the end and S somewhere.\n\nSo step-by-step:\n\nWord must be: ? ? ? ? E\nMust include S (in position 2,3, or 4)\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, O, L\nAvailable: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe are guessing ""GUISE"": G1, U2, I3, S4, E5\n\nIf G is in the word and correct position? Position 1: if G is in the word, then if it\'s in position 1, we might get ✓ for G. If it\'s in the word but wrong position, we get -.

Looking at the feedback from all three guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) - so the word ends with E

**Guess 2: stole**
- S: in the word but wrong position (-) - so S is in the word, but not in position 1
- T: not in the word (x)
- O: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) - confirmed again

**Guess 3: guise**
- G: correct position (✓) - so G is the first letter of the word
- U: not in the word (x)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: correct position (✓) - so S is the fourth letter of the word
- E: correct position (✓) - fifth letter E

Putting it all together:
- The word starts with G (from guess 3: G✓)
- Ends with E (from guess 1 and 2)
- The fourth letter is S (from guess 3: S✓)
- So the pattern is: G _ _ S E

Also, we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, U, I (from all feedback)
- S is in position 4, but we already used that
- E is in position 5

We need to figure out the second and third letters (positions 2 and 3).

The second and third letters must be from the alphabet excluding the excluded letters we know: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, U, I.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Also, the whole word must form a valid English word matching G ? ? S E.

Possible candidates:
- GHOSE? Not a common word
- GLASE? But L is excluded
- GPASE? Not a word
- We need real words ending with SE after G? Actually, G _ _ S E

Common words matching G ? ? S E:
- ""GUIDE"" would be G U I D E, but U and I are excluded, and we have S in the fourth position, but ""GUIDE"" has D in fourth? No, GUIDE is G-U-I-D-E, so fourth letter D, not S.

We need S in the fourth position.

Another common word: ""GOOSE"" but O is excluded, and the fourth letter is S? GOOSE is G-O-O-S-E, so fourth letter is S? Actually, positions: G1 O2 O3 S4 E5? Yes, but O is excluded from guess 2 (stole: O x). So O is not in the word.

""GEESE"": G-E-E-S-E? But we have two E's? Yes, but letters: G, E, E, S, E. Position 4 is S? GEESE is G-E-E-S-E, so it matches G _ _ S E: position 2 should be E, position 3 E? But position 3 is E? GEESE has E in position 2, E in position 3? G1 E2 E3 S4 E5? Yes.

Now, check excluded letters: 
- E is present, but it's allowed (we haven't excluded E, and we know it's in the word).
- But E is already known to be in the word.
- The word GEESE has three E's? Valid? Yes, it's a word (plural of goose).
- Excluded letters: are any in GEESE? We have G, E, E, S, E. Excluded: C,R,A,N,T,O,L,U,I — none present.

But position 2 and 3: both E? That would be E and E.

But in the pattern, position 2 and 3 need to be filled.

So GEESE: 
- Position 1: G (correct)
- Position 2: E? 
- Position 3: E?
- Position 4: S (correct)
- Position 5: E (correct)

Now, could E be in position 2 and 3? We know E is in position 5, but we don't know if it can be elsewhere. From guess 1: ""crane"" had E in position 5 correct, but no other E, so if E were in other positions, it might have shown up? But in ""crane"", the E was in position 5 and they said E✓, but if there were another E, it might not have been indicated? Actually, the feedback is per position.

For example, in ""crane"", only position 5 had E and it was correct. If there were another E, say in position 2, then in ""crane"" if position 2 had a wrong letter, it might be marked with '-' if it were E, but position 2 was R which was not in the word, so no indication about E elsewhere.

But in guess 3: ""guise"" which had G U I S E. Feedback for position 3 I(x), meaning I is not in the word, but no mention of E elsewhere.

If the secret word had E in position 2 or 3, when we guessed ""guise"", which has U in position 2 and I in position 3, both received x, meaning neither letter is in the word. If E were in position 2, for example, and we guessed U, it would be x for U, but E would be missing from the feedback? No, feedback might indicate E is present but not correct position, if it exists.

But in ""guise"", position 2 is U: marked x, meaning U is not in the word. Position 3 I: x, meaning I not in word. Position 5 E: ✓. So if E were present elsewhere, it would have been indicated? For instance, if E were in position 3, but we guessed I, we might get - for that position if E is in the word but wrong position? No, because - means the letter is in the word but wrong position. If we guess a letter not in the word, it's x.

But for E, since position 5 is correct, and E might be elsewhere? For ""guise"", we didn't guess E in position 2 or 3; we guessed U and I, so if E were in position 2, and we guessed U, the feedback should show that E is in the word but not guessed here? Actually, no: the feedback only gives information about the guessed letters.

Specifically, for each guessed letter, it tells if that specific letter is present and in correct position or not.

So for position 2 in ""guise"": guessed U, which is not in the word, so x.

Similarly position 3: guessed I, not in word.

It doesn't reveal that E should be there; it only says about U and I.

Therefore, E could be present in other positions? For example, if the word has E in position 3, we haven't guessed any letter that would reveal that.

So going back to ""GEESE"": it has E in positions 2, 3, 5? Positions: G1, E2, E3, S4, E5 — so E in position 2 and 3? Is that possible?

And letters: G, E, S — no excluded letters.

Other possibilities: ""GRESE"" isn't common. ""GWISE"" not a word.

""GOOSE"" is out because O excluded.

""GLYSE""? Uncommon.

Another word: ""GASSY"" but ends with Y, not E? We need E at end.

""GUSSE"": not common.

Perhaps ""GUISE"" was almost correct but I and U wrong.

Another candidate: ""GESSO"" — ends with O, not E? No.

Valid words: 
- ""GAFFE"": G,A,F,F,E — but A is excluded? First guess: A(x). So A cannot be. Also, position 4 is F, not S? We need S in position 4.

So GAFFE has F in position 4? G1 A2 F3 F4 E5? Position 4 not S.

We need position 4 to be S.

Common words: ""GASPS"" ends with S? Not E.

""HASPS"" similar.

I think ""GEESE"" might be possible.

Another word: ""GUESS"" ends with S? Not E.

"" GRASP"" ends with P.

Back to ""GEESE"": 
- Pattern G E E S E? 
- Position 2: E? 
- Position 3: E?

Now, from feedback:
- Guess 1 ""crane"" had no E in positions 1-4? No feedback for E elsewhere because we didn't guess E in other positions.
- Guess 2 ""stole"" had positions: S T O L E — E only in position 5? Position 2 T, position 3 O, both not E, so didn't guess E elsewhere? So E might be in other positions.
- Guess 3 ""guise"" had positions: G U I S E — guessed U and I in positions 2 and 3, both not E, so if E were there, we wouldn't know.

So ""GEESE"" is possible.

But let's confirm if it uses excluded letters: G E E S E — only G, E, S. E is allowed, S allowed, G allowed. Excluded letters are C,R,A,N,T,O,L,U,I — none in ""GEESE"".

Also, position 1: G ✓, position 4: S ✓, position 5: E ✓, position 2: E?, position 3: E?

Is there another word? For example, ""GUISE"" was guessed and gave feedback that U and I are not in the word.

Another possibility: ""GYMSE"" not a word.

""PERS"" not long enough.

Perhaps ""GHYLLS"" but not 5 letters or ending E.

I think ""GEESE"" is the only common word that fits.

But let's think: words with G _ _ S E pattern.

Alternative: ""GESSE"" — like a surname, not common.

""GEODE"" — G E O D E? Position 4 D? Not S. But O is excluded.

""GEESE"" seems the best bet.

In the available letters, E is allowed multiple times? Since it's not excluded.

So secret word could be ""GEESE"".

But in feedback from guess 2: ""stole"" had S in position 1, marked (-), meaning S is in the word but position wrong. In ""GEESE"", S is in position 4, so if we guessed S in position 1, it should say - if S is present elsewhere, which we got.

Similarly, in guess 1: ""crane"" had E in position 5 ✓, but no indication of other E's.

So ""GEESE"" seems plausible.

But letter frequency: if the secret word is ""GEESE"", it has three E's.

For the next guess, since we have only 4 guesses left, but if we can solve it now.

We have the pattern with positions 2 and 3 unknown.

But with excluded letters, we can try a guess that fills 2 and 3.

Since we have G _ _ S E, and we know letters to avoid: C,R,A,N,T,O,L,U,I.

Available for position 2 and 3: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

And E is allowed too.

""GEESE"" uses E in both positions.

Other words: for example, if position 2 is H, position 3 K: ""GHKSE"" not a word.

Common possibilities:
- If position 2 is E, position 3 something? But S is at 4, so GE?SE — e.g., ""GEESE"", ""GEODE"" but O excluded, ""GENRE"" has N and R excluded? N excluded.

""GENIE"" has N? Excluded.

""GLENS"" has L? Excluded.

Perhaps only ""GEESE"" fits.

Another word: ""GREWS"" ends with S? Not E.

"" GRADS"" not E.

I think ""GEESE"" is the most likely.

Since we know G and S and E, we can guess ""GEESE"" directly.

But let's see: in the pattern, for positions 2 and 3: if not E, what could it be? For example, ""GASPS"" doesn't end E.

"" GOUPS"" has O and U excluded.

Perhaps ""GIPSY"" ends with Y? Not E.

It's hard to find alternatives.

""GYPSY"" has Y? Ending Y.

Another word: ""DENSE"" but starts D.

For G: ""GAZES""? A excluded? A excluded, and position 4 E? GAZES is G-A-Z-E-S, so ends with S, not E? Position 5 S.

We need E at position 5.

So GAZES doesn't work.

""GAMES"" ends with S? Position 5 S.

Not E.

""GIVES"" ends with S? G-I-V-E-S, position 5 S.

We need position 5 E.

So ""GEESE"" seems the only common word.

Perhaps ""GESSE"" is obsolete for water, but ""geese"" is valid.

So I'll go with ""geese"".

But in the feedback framework, we are to make a guess, and it must be valid.

So final guess: ""geese""

In terms of correctness: position 2 E, position 3 E.

But if secret word is not ""geese"", we might get feedback indicating so.

But based on available information, it seems likely.
</think>
Based on the cumulative feedback from all guesses:

### What We Know:
1. **Correct Letters & Positions**:  
   - **G** is in position 1 (from `guise` feedback: G(✓)).  
   - **S** is in position 4 (from `guise` feedback: S(✓)).  
   - **E** is in position 5 (confirmed in all guesses: E(✓)).  
   So the secret word pattern is **`G _ _ S E`**.

2. **Excluded Letters (absolutely NOT in the word)**:  
   - C, R, A, N (from `crane`: all marked `x`).  
   - T, O, L (from `stole`: all marked `x`).  
   - U, I (from `guise`: U(x), I(x)).  
   **Total exclusions**: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, U, I.  
   Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E may appear more than once, but no feedback suggests it).

3. **S Position Constraint**:  
   - S is in the word but not in position 1 (from `stole` feedback: S(-)), and is now confirmed in position 4.

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- The secret word starts with G, ends with E, and has S at position 4: **`G ? ? S E`**.  
- Positions 2 and 3 need to be filled with letters **not** in the excluded list, forming a valid English word.  
- Given the pattern, common words like ""GEESE"" fit:  
  - **G E E S E**: E is allowed (since E is confirmed but may repeat), no excluded letters (G, E, S all valid), and it matches the pattern.  
- Other possibilities are rare (e.g., ""GESSE"" is obscure). Given feedback, ""GEESE"" is highly probable as it uses common letters and aligns with ""G _ _ S E"".

### Why ""GEESE""?  
- Maximizes direct test of positions 2 and 3 by placing E (a known letter) there.  
- If correct, it solves the word; if not, feedback will clarify E's presence (e.g., if E is not in position 2 or 3, we may see `x` or `-`).  
- Avoids excluded letters and leverages known positions efficiently.

**Next Guess**: GEESE  

<guess>geese</guess>",geese,"Looking at the feedback from all three guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) - so the word ends with E

**Guess 2: stole**
- S: in the word but wrong position (-) - so S is in the word, but not in position 1
- T: not in the word (x)
- O: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) - confirmed again

**Guess 3: guise**
- G: correct position (✓) - so G is the first letter of the word
- U: not in the word (x)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: correct position (✓) - so S is the fourth letter of the word
- E: correct position (✓) - fifth letter E

Putting it all together:
- The word starts with G (from guess 3: G✓)
- Ends with E (from guess 1 and 2)
- The fourth letter is S (from guess 3: S✓)
- So the pattern is: G _ _ S E

Also, we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, U, I (from all feedback)
- S is in position 4, but we already used that
- E is in position 5

We need to figure out the second and third letters (positions 2 and 3).

The second and third letters must be from the alphabet excluding the excluded letters we know: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, U, I.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Also, the whole word must form a valid English word matching G ? ? S E.

Possible candidates:
- GHOSE? Not a common word
- GLASE? But L is excluded
- GPASE? Not a word
- We need real words ending with SE after G? Actually, G _ _ S E

Common words matching G ? ? S E:
- ""GUIDE"" would be G U I D E, but U and I are excluded, and we have S in the fourth position, but ""GUIDE"" has D in fourth? No, GUIDE is G-U-I-D-E, so fourth letter D, not S.

We need S in the fourth position.

Another common word: ""GOOSE"" but O is excluded, and the fourth letter is S? GOOSE is G-O-O-S-E, so fourth letter is S? Actually, positions: G1 O2 O3 S4 E5? Yes, but O is excluded from guess 2 (stole: O x). So O is not in the word.

""GEESE"": G-E-E-S-E? But we have two E's? Yes, but letters: G, E, E, S, E. Position 4 is S? GEESE is G-E-E-S-E, so it matches G _ _ S E: position 2 should be E, position 3 E? But position 3 is E? GEESE has E in position 2, E in position 3? G1 E2 E3 S4 E5? Yes.

Now, check excluded letters: 
- E is present, but it's allowed (we haven't excluded E, and we know it's in the word).
- But E is already known to be in the word.
- The word GEESE has three E's? Valid? Yes, it's a word (plural of goose).

But position 2 and 3: both E? That would be E and E.

But in the pattern, position 2 and 3 need to be filled.

So GEESE: 
- Position 1: G (correct)
- Position 2: E? 
- Position 3: E?
- Position 4: S (correct)
- Position 5: E (correct)

Now, could E be in position 2 and 3? We know E is in position 5, but we don't know if it can be elsewhere. From guess 1: ""crane"" had E in position 5 correct, but no other E, so if E were in other positions, it might have shown up?

But in guess 3: ""guise"" which had G U I S E. Feedback for position 3 I(x), meaning I is not in the word, but no mention of E elsewhere.

If the secret word had E in position 2 or 3, when we guessed ""guise"", which has U in position 2 and I in position 3, both received x, meaning neither letter is in the word. If E were in position 2, for example, and we guessed U, it would be x for U, but E would be missing from the feedback? No, feedback might indicate E is present but not correct position, if it exists.

But in ""guise"", position 2 is U: marked x, meaning U is not in the word. Position 3 I: x, meaning I not in word. Position 5 E: ✓. So if E were present elsewhere, it would have been indicated? For instance, if E were in position 3, but we guessed I, we might get - for that position if E is in the word but wrong position? No, because - means the letter is in the word but wrong position. If we guess a letter not in the word, it's x.

But for E, since position 5 is correct, and E might be elsewhere? For ""guise"", we didn't guess E in position 2 or 3; we guessed U and I, so if E were in position 2, and we guessed U, the feedback should show that E is in the word but not guessed here?

So for position 2 in ""guise"": guessed U, which is not in the word, so x.

Similarly position 3: guessed I, not in word.

It doesn't reveal that E should be there; it only says about U and I.

Therefore, E could be present in other positions? For example, if the word has E in position 3, we haven't guessed any letter that would reveal that.

So going back to ""GEESE"": it has E in positions 2, 3, 5? Positions: G1, E2, E3, S4, E5 — so E in position 2 and 3? Is that possible?

Back to ""GEESE"": 
- Pattern G E E S E? 
- Position 2: E? 
- Position 3: E?

Now, from feedback:
- Guess 1 ""crane"" had no E in positions 1-4? No feedback for E elsewhere because we didn't guess E in other positions.
- Guess 2 ""stole"" had positions: S T O L E — E only in position 5? Position 2 T, position 3 O, both not E, so didn't guess E elsewhere? So E might be in other positions.

   - S is in the word but not in position 1 (from `stole` feedback: S(-)), and is now confirmed in position 4.

### Analysis for Next Guess:
- The secret word starts with G, ends with E, and has S at position 4: **`G ? ? S E`**.  
- Positions 2 and 3 need to be filled with letters **not** in the excluded list, forming a valid English word.  
- Given the pattern, common words like ""GEESE"" fit:  
  - **G E E S E**: E is allowed (since E is confirmed but may repeat), no excluded letters (G, E, S all valid), and it matches the pattern.  
- Other possibilities are rare (e.g., ""GESSE"" is obscure). Given feedback, ""GEESE"" is highly probable as it uses common letters and aligns with ""G _ _ S E"".

### Why ""GEESE""?  
- Maximizes direct test of positions 2 and 3 by placing E (a known letter) there.  
- If correct, it solves the word; if not, feedback will clarify E's presence (e.g., if E is not in position 2 or 3, we may see `x` or `-`).  
- Avoids excluded letters and leverages known positions efficiently.
