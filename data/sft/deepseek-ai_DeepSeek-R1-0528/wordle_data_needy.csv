We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has a good mix of common letters. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(-) -> N is in the word but in the wrong position.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So we know:
 - The secret word contains N and E, but not in the positions they were guessed.
 - The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions, and considering the positions in ""crane"":
   N was in the 4th position -> so N cannot be in the 4th position of the secret word.
   E was in the 5th position -> so E cannot be in the 5th position of the secret word.

 We also know the secret word has 5 letters and we have to come up with a new guess.

 We must avoid using C, R, A.

 Let's think of words that contain N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

 Possible letters: We have many letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5.

 We need to choose a word that has N and E in positions other than 4 and 5 respectively? Actually, N could be in any position except 4, and E in any position except 5.

 But note: the feedback for N was ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. Similarly for E.

 Since we have two letters that must be included: N and E.

 We can try to pick a word that has N and E, and then other common letters.

 Example: ""LENIS"" (meaning: a musical term) but let's think of more common words.

 Alternatively: ""STEIN"" -> S T E I N.

 Let me check: 
   Position 1: S -> might be okay? 
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: E -> note that E was in the wrong position? It was previously in position 5, now we put it in position 3 -> that's allowed.
   Position 4: I
   Position 5: N -> but wait: N was in position 4 in the first guess and was wrong. Now we put it in position 5 -> that is allowed? The feedback said N is in the word but not at position 4. Position 5 is different, so it could be.

 However, note that E cannot be in position 5? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Similarly, N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 So in ""STEIN"": 
   E is in position 3 -> allowed.
   N is in position 5 -> allowed.

 But we don't know if S, T, I are in the word? We haven't ruled them out.

 We must avoid using C, R, A.

 Another idea: since the word must have N and E, let's try ""MEAN"" but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

 Example 5-letter words: ""MEANT"" -> wait, but it has A? A is not allowed because we know A is not in the secret word.

 Similarly, ""MEANS"" -> has A again? No, ""MEANS"" has M, E, A, N, S -> A is present which we know is absent. So we cannot use A.

 Let me try to think of words without C, R, A, and that contain N and E.

 Possible words: 
   ""SLEET"" -> but L and T are new? But note: does it contain N? No, it doesn't.
   ""STEEN"" -> not common? 
   ""STEIN"" is acceptable? It's a word meaning a beer mug or a musical note.

 Another word: ""SPEND"" -> has S, P, E, N, D.

 How about ""SPINE""? But ""SPINE"" has I and P? Let me list: S, P, I, N, E.

 But note: E is in position 5? Wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5.

 So in ""SPINE"", E is at position 5 -> not allowed? Because the secret word does not have E at position 5? Therefore, we cannot use words with E at the end (position 5).

 In ""STEIN"", E is at position 3 -> good.

 Another option: ""SNIDE"" -> E is at position 5 -> not allowed? So we must avoid E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""STEIN"" seems okay: 
  S, T, E, I, N -> positions 1: S, 2: T, 3: E, 4: I, 5: N.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SETON"" (a word in anatomy) but less common.

 Or ""LINEN"": 
   L, I, N, E, N -> wait, has two Ns? 
   Positions: 
      1: L
      2: I
      3: N -> but we know N cannot be at position 4? What about position 3? Feedback: N was previously in position 4 and was incorrect. But that doesn't say anything about position 3? So position 3 is allowed. 
      4: E -> but E is now in position 4 (was previously not in position 5). Position 4 is allowed? Yes, because E can be anywhere except position 5.
   But note: the secret word contains one N? Or two? We don't know. But ""LINEN"" has two N's? So if the secret word has two N's? But we have only one N reported? The feedback for ""crane"" had one N and it was marked as present. So the secret word has at least one N. But it might have more? However, the feedback doesn't tell us how many, so we cannot assume only one.

 However, in ""LINEN"", we are placing N at position 3 and position 5. The feedback for ""crane"" only told us that the N was present (but in the wrong position). It could be that the secret word has two N's? Or one? We don't know.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us the frequency, so we have to be cautious.

 Another word: ""KNEEL"" -> but E is in position 3 and 4? And N at position 1? 
   Position 1: K -> okay
   Position 2: N -> okay? N was previously in position 4 and wrong. Now we put it at position 2? That is allowed? Yes.
   Positions 3 and 4: E -> but E can be in positions 1-4? So yes.
   However, we have two E's? And one N.

 This is getting complicated.

 Let me stick to words without repeated letters if possible? To avoid complications.

 How about ""INLET""?
   I, N, L, E, T
   Positions:
     1: I
     2: N -> allowed? (since N cannot be at 4, but 2 is fine)
     3: L
     4: E -> E can be at position 4? (since it cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay)
     5: T

 But wait: E is at position 4 -> which is not position 5 -> acceptable.
 However, we must note: the feedback said that N is not at position 4. We are putting N at position 2 -> okay.

 We don't know about I, L, T? They might be in the word? Or not.

 Alternatively, ""BONES"": 
   B, O, N, E, S -> but O? 
   Positions: 
      1: B
      2: O
      3: N -> N in position 3? Previously was in position 4 and incorrect. Position 3 is okay.
      4: E -> E cannot be in position 5? Position 4 is okay? However, we must note: E was in position 5 before? We are putting it in position 4 -> okay.
   But we have E in position 4 -> okay? Yes.

 However, we are using O? We don't know if O is in the word? It might be.

 But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible? 

 Another word: ""SPEND"": 
   S, P, E, N, D
   Positions:
     1: S
     2: P
     3: E -> E not in position 5 -> okay.
     4: N -> Wait! N in position 4? But the feedback said N cannot be in position 4? So this would be invalid? 
        We know the secret word has N, but not at position 4? So if we put N at position 4, then the feedback would mark it as either:
          - Correct? But the word doesn't have it at position 4? No, we are guessing N at position 4? But actually, the feedback might tell us that it's present but wrong? Or absent? 
        Actually, we know the secret word has N but not in position 4? So if we put N at position 4, it would be marked as wrong (probably ""-"" if the word has N elsewhere? or if it has two Ns? it could be marked as correct? But no) -> 
        Actually, if the secret word has N at position 4, then the feedback in the first guess would have been correct? But it wasn't? So the secret word does not have N at position 4? Therefore, we must not use a word that puts N at position 4? Because it's impossible.

 Therefore, we cannot put N at position 4 in any of our guesses? So ""SPEND"" has N at position 4? That is forbidden? So we must avoid position 4 for N.

 Similarly, we must avoid position 5 for E.

 Therefore, ""SPEND"" is invalid? Because we are putting N at position 4? But the secret word does not have N at position 4? So why put it there? We would get a '-' or 'x'? Actually, we want to get more information? But it's a valid guess? But it's known to be wrong? 

 However, the rules do not forbid guessing the same letter in a position we know is wrong? But it's inefficient? We would be wasting a position? 

 So better to avoid known wrong positions? 

 Therefore, let's avoid putting N at position 4 and E at position 5.

 In ""SPEND"", we have E at position 3 and N at position 4? 
   Position 4: N -> we know the secret word does not have N at position 4? So we would get either:
      - If the secret word has N elsewhere and position 4 is not occupied by N? Then the N in our guess would be marked as '-' meaning present but wrong? 
      - But what if the secret word has two N's? And one of them is at position 4? ... Wait, but we know for sure that position 4 is not N? Because the first guess ""crane"" had N at position 4 and it was not correct? So the secret word does not have N at position 4? Even if it has two N's? 

 Therefore, we will get a '-' for N at position 4? Or if the secret word has only one N and it's not at position 4? Then we get '-'. So we will get '-' for N? Which we already know? We don't gain new information? So it's inefficient? We can do better?

 Alternatively, we can try to put N in a new position? To get more information? So let's avoid position 4 for N? And position 5 for E? 

 So going back to ""STEIN"": 
   S at 1? 
   T at 2?
   E at 3 -> okay (E not at 5)
   I at 4 -> we don't know about position 4? 
   N at 5 -> okay? Because N wasn't at position 4? But position 5 is new? And we don't know? 

 However, note: the secret word has N? So placing N at position 5: if it's correct? Then we get a check? Or if it's wrong? We get '-'.

 And we get information about S, T, I.

 Similarly, we can try ""UNSET"" (meaning: not set) -> 
   U, N, S, E, T
   Positions:
     1: U
     2: N -> okay? (N not at position 4? 2 is new)
     3: S
     4: E -> E cannot be at position 5? Position 4 is okay? 
     5: T

 We avoid E at position 5? So E at 4 -> okay? And N at 2 -> okay? 

 But we are introducing U? 

 Another idea: ""MEANY"" -> but has A? No, A is excluded.

 How about ""SETUP"" -> 
   S, E, T, U, P
   But does it have N? No. We must include N? Because it is known to be in the word? 

 So we have to include N? 

 Therefore, we must choose a word that has both N and E? 

 And without C, R, A? 

 Let me consider ""STONE"": 
   S, T, O, N, E -> 
     Positions:
       1: S
       2: T
       3: O
       4: N -> but we cannot put N at position 4! So invalid.

 ""STONE"" has N at position 4 -> forbidden? 

 So we need a word that has N and E? And N not at position 4? E not at position 5? 

 Possibilities:
   N at positions: 1, 2, 3, 5? 
   E at positions: 1, 2, 3, 4?

 I think ""STEIN"" (which is S T E I N) is acceptable: 
   N is at position 5 -> not position 4 -> okay? 
   E is at position 3 -> not position 5? -> okay? 

 Similarly, ""SENT"" with an added letter? ""SENT"" is 4 letters? 

 ""SENTI"" (a word? Not really?) -> let's not.

 How about ""LEMON"": has L, E, M, O, N -> 
   Positions:
     1: L
     2: E -> E allowed at 2? yes
     3: M
     4: O -> ? 
     5: N -> N allowed at 5? yes.

 So E at position 2? and N at position 5? 

 Another: ""MINCE"" -> but has C? C is excluded? So we cannot use C.

 We have to avoid C, R, A.

 ""NOISE"": 
   N, O, I, S, E -> 
   Positions: 
     1: N -> allowed? (N not at position 4? yes)
     2: O
     3: I
     4: S
     5: E -> but E was previously not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? 

 So ""NOISE"" invalid? Because E is at position 5? 

 Therefore, we need to rearrange? How about ""ENVOY""?
   E, N, V, O, Y -> 
   Positions:
     1: E -> allowed? (E can be at 1? yes)
     2: N -> allowed? (N not at 4? yes)
     3: V
     4: O
     5: Y

 This word has E and N? And avoids the forbidden positions? Yes.

 But common? Okay, it's acceptable? 

 However, I want to test as many common letters as possible? 

 Another word: ""BEING"": 
   B, E, I, N, G -> 
   Positions:
     1: B
     2: E -> E at position 2: allowed
     3: I
     4: N -> wait, N at position 4? We know N is not at position 4? So we are putting N at a known forbidden position? 
        That would yield either a '-' (if the secret word has N elsewhere) or 'x' (if we are mistaken about the presence of N? but we know it's present) -> but we are sure N is present? So it would be '-'. But we don't get new position information? Because we already know position 4 is wrong? 

 We should avoid that? So let me avoid position 4 for N.

 Therefore, ""BEING"" has N at position 4? Avoid.

 How about ""BEGUN"": 
   B, E, G, U, N -> 
   Positions:
     1: B
     2: E -> okay
     3: G
     4: U
     5: N -> okay? 
   So E at position 2, N at position 5? 

 Similarly, ""DEIGN"" (meaning: to condescend) -> 
   D, E, I, G, N -> 
   Positions:
     1: D
     2: E -> okay
     3: I
     4: G
     5: N -> okay.

 But note: if we put E and N only in the positions we know they are allowed? But we have many possibilities? 

 I think ""STEIN"" is a good candidate? Because we have common letters S, T, and I? 

 Alternatively, ""DEIGN"" is a bit uncommon? 

 What about ""KEEN""? No, 4 letters? 

 How about ""QUEEN""? It has two E's? 
   Q, U, E, E, N -> 
   But what positions?
     1: Q
     2: U
     3: E -> okay
     4: E -> but wait, we know E is in the word? But how many? We don't know? 
     5: N -> okay.
   We haven't avoided C, R, A? Yes.
   But we know the secret word has at least one E? Could it have two? We don't know? 

 It's acceptable? 

 However, Q is a rare letter? Might not be good? 

 Another word: ""SPINE"": 
   S, P, I, N, E -> 
   Positions:
     1: S
     2: P
     3: I
     4: N -> wait, position 4: N -> we know N is not at position 4? So avoid.

 So ""SPINE"" invalid? 

 How about ""PINED""? 
   P, I, N, E, D -> 
   Positions:
     1: P
     2: I
     3: N -> okay? (N not at 4? now at 3) 
     4: E -> okay? (E not at 5? now at 4)
     5: D
   So N at position 3? Allowed? E at position 4? Allowed? 

 So ""PINED"" seems good? 

 We haven't used any of the excluded letters? 

 But wait, we have E at position 4? Previously we had E at position 5? Now we put at 4? We'll see if that's correct? 

 And N at position 3? Previously at position 4? Now at 3? 

 We'll get information about P, I, D? 

 Alternatively, ""DINED"": 
   D, I, N, E, D -> wait, repeated D? Or ""DINES"": 
   D, I, N, E, S -> 
   Positions:
     1: D
     2: I
     3: N -> okay
     4: E -> okay
     5: S

 I think I'll go with ""STEIN"":

   S, T, E, I, N

   Because it uses common letters? 

   But note: if we get feedback for E at position 3? If E isn't at position 3? Then we know E is elsewhere? 

   Similarly, N at position 5? 

   Also, T and I are new? 

   We are using S? Which was not used before? 

   So let me choose ""STEIN"".

 If I choose ""STEIN"", and the secret word does not have T? Then we'll know.

 We have 6 tries? So we can iterate.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""STEIN"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, R, A are **not** in the secret word.  
- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (N was position 4, E was position 5).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include N and E (since they are in the secret word).  
- N cannot be in position 4 (from feedback).  
- E cannot be in position 5 (from feedback).  
- Avoid C, R, A.  

After evaluating options:  
- ""STEIN"" is chosen (common letters, tests positions effectively).  
  - S, T, E, I, N: New consonants and vowel tested.  
  - E is in position 3 (allowed position).  
  - N is in position 5 (allowed position).  

<guess>stein</guess>",stein,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(-) -> N is in the word but in the wrong position.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So we know:
 - The secret word contains N and E, but not in the positions they were guessed.
 - The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions, and considering the positions in ""crane"":
   N was in the 4th position -> so N cannot be in the 4th position of the secret word.
   E was in the 5th position -> so E cannot be in the 5th position of the secret word.

 We also know the secret word has 5 letters and we have to come up with a new guess.

 We must avoid using C, R, A.

 Let's think of words that contain N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

 Possible letters: We have many letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5.

 We need to choose a word that has N and E in positions other than 4 and 5 respectively? Actually, N could be in any position except 4, and E in any position except 5.

 But note: the feedback for N was ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. Similarly for E.

 Since we have two letters that must be included: N and E.

 We can try to pick a word that has N and E, and then other common letters.

 Example: ""LENIS"" (meaning: a musical term) but let's think of more common words.

 Alternatively: ""STEIN"" -> S T E I N.

 Let me check: 
   Position 1: S -> might be okay? 
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: E -> note that E was in the wrong position? It was previously in position 5, now we put it in position 3 -> that's allowed.
   Position 4: I
   Position 5: N -> but wait: N was in position 4 in the first guess and was wrong. Now we put it in position 5 -> that is allowed? The feedback said N is in the word but not at position 4. Position 5 is different, so it could be.

 However, note that E cannot be in position 5? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Similarly, N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 So in ""STEIN"": 
   E is in position 3 -> allowed.
   N is in position 5 -> allowed.

 But we don't know if S, T, I are in the word? We haven't ruled them out.

 We must avoid using C, R, A.

 Another idea: since the word must have N and E, let's try ""MEAN"" but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

 Example 5-letter words: ""MEANT"" -> wait, but it has A? A is not allowed because we know A is not in the secret word.

 Similarly, ""MEANS"" -> has A again? No, ""MEANS"" has M, E, A, N, S -> A is present which we know is absent. So we cannot use A.

 Let me try to think of words without C, R, A, and that contain N and E.

 Possible words: 
   ""SLEET"" -> but L and T are new? But note: does it contain N? No, it doesn't.
   ""STEEN"" -> not common? 
   ""STEIN"" is acceptable? It's a word meaning a beer mug or a musical note.

 Another word: ""SPEND"" -> has S, P, E, N, D.

 How about ""SPINE""? But ""SPINE"" has I and P? Let me list: S, P, I, N, E.

 But note: E is in position 5? Wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5.

 So in ""SPINE"", E is at position 5 -> not allowed? Because the secret word does not have E at position 5? Therefore, we cannot use words with E at the end (position 5).

 In ""STEIN"", E is at position 3 -> good.

 Another option: ""SNIDE"" -> E is at position 5 -> not allowed? So we must avoid E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""STEIN"" seems okay: 
  S, T, E, I, N -> positions 1: S, 2: T, 3: E, 4: I, 5: N.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SETON"" (a word in anatomy) but less common.

 Or ""LINEN"": 
   L, I, N, E, N -> wait, has two Ns? 
   Positions: 
      1: L
      2: I
      3: N -> but we know N cannot be at position 4? What about position 3? Feedback: N was previously in position 4 and was incorrect. But that doesn't say anything about position 3? So position 3 is allowed. 
      4: E -> but E is now in position 4 (was previously not in position 5). Position 4 is allowed? Yes, because E can be anywhere except position 5.
   But note: the secret word contains one N? Or two? We don't know. But ""LINEN"" has two N's? So if the secret word has two N's? But we have only one N reported? The feedback for ""crane"" had one N and it was marked as present. So the secret word has at least one N. But it might have more? However, the feedback doesn't tell us how many, so we cannot assume only one.

 However, in ""LINEN"", we are placing N at position 3 and position 5. The feedback for ""crane"" only told us that the N was present (but in the wrong position). It could be that the secret word has two N's? Or one? We don't know.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us the frequency, so we have to be cautious.

 Another word: ""KNEEL"" -> but E is in position 3 and 4? And N at position 1? 
   Position 1: K -> okay
   Position 2: N -> okay? N was previously in position 4 and wrong. Now we put it at position 2? That is allowed? Yes.
   Positions 3 and 4: E -> but E can be in positions 1-4? So yes.
   However, we have two E's? And one N.

 This is getting complicated.

 Let me stick to words without repeated letters if possible? To avoid complications.

 How about ""INLET""?
   I, N, L, E, T
   Positions:
     1: I
     2: N -> allowed? (since N cannot be at 4, but 2 is fine)
     3: L
     4: E -> E can be at position 4? (since it cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay)
     5: T

 But wait: E is at position 4 -> which is not position 5 -> acceptable.
 However, we must note: the feedback said that N is not at position 4. We are putting N at position 2 -> okay.

 We don't know about I, L, T? They might be in the word? Or not.

 Alternatively, ""BONES"": 
   B, O, N, E, S -> but O? 
   Positions: 
      1: B
      2: O
      3: N -> N in position 3? Previously was in position 4 and incorrect. Position 3 is okay.
      4: E -> E cannot be in position 5? Position 4 is okay? However, we must note: E was in position 5 before? We are putting it in position 4 -> okay.
   But we have E in position 4 -> okay? Yes.

 However, we are using O? We don't know if O is in the word? It might be.

 But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible? 

 Another word: ""SPEND"": 
   S, P, E, N, D
   Positions:
     1: S
     2: P
     3: E -> E not in position 5 -> okay.
     4: N -> Wait! N in position 4? But the feedback said N cannot be in position 4? So this would be invalid? 
        We know the secret word has N, but not at position 4? So if we put N at position 4, then the feedback would mark it as either:
          - Correct? But the word doesn't have it at position 4? No, we are guessing N at position 4? But actually, the feedback might tell us that it's present but wrong? Or absent? 
        Actually, we know the secret word has N but not in position 4? So if we put N at position 4, it would be marked as wrong (probably ""-"" if the word has N elsewhere? or if it has two Ns? it could be marked as correct? But no) -> 
        Actually, if the secret word has N at position 4, then the feedback in the first guess would have been correct? But it wasn't? So the secret word does not have N at position 4? Therefore, we must not use a word that puts N at position 4? Because it's impossible.

 Therefore, we cannot put N at position 4 in any of our guesses? So ""SPEND"" has N at position 4? That is forbidden? So we must avoid position 4 for N.

 Similarly, we must avoid position 5 for E.

 Therefore, ""SPEND"" is invalid? Because we are putting N at position 4? But the secret word does not have N at position 4? So why put it there? We would get a '-' or 'x'? Actually, we want to get more information? But it's a valid guess? But it's known to be wrong? 

 However, the rules do not forbid guessing the same letter in a position we know is wrong? But it's inefficient? We would be wasting a position? 

 So better to avoid known wrong positions? 

 Therefore, let's avoid putting N at position 4 and E at position 5.

 In ""SPEND"", we have E at position 3 and N at position 4? 
   Position 4: N -> we know the secret word does not have N at position 4? So we would get either:
      - If the secret word has N elsewhere and position 4 is not occupied by N? Then the N in our guess would be marked as '-' meaning present but wrong? 
      - But what if the secret word has two N's? And one of them is at position 4? ... Wait, but we know for sure that position 4 is not N? Because the first guess ""crane"" had N at position 4 and it was not correct? So the secret word does not have N at position 4? Even if it has two N's? 

 Therefore, we will get a '-' for N at position 4? Or if the secret word has only one N and it's not at position 4? Then we get '-'. So we will get '-' for N? Which we already know? We don't gain new information? So it's inefficient? We can do better?

 Alternatively, we can try to put N in a new position? To get more information? So let's avoid position 4 for N? And position 5 for E? 

 So going back to ""STEIN"": 
   S at 1? 
   T at 2?
   E at 3 -> okay (E not at 5)
   I at 4 -> we don't know about position 4? 
   N at 5 -> okay? Because N wasn't at position 4? But position 5 is new? And we don't know? 

 However, note: the secret word has N? So placing N at position 5: if it's correct? Then we get a check? Or if it's wrong? We get '-'.

 And we get information about S, T, I.

 Similarly, we can try ""UNSET"" (meaning: not set) -> 
   U, N, S, E, T
   Positions:
     1: U
     2: N -> okay? (N not at position 4? 2 is new)
     3: S
     4: E -> E cannot be at position 5? Position 4 is okay? 
     5: T

 We avoid E at position 5? So E at 4 -> okay? And N at 2 -> okay? 

 But we are introducing U? 

 Another idea: ""MEANY"" -> but has A? No, A is excluded.

 How about ""SETUP"" -> 
   S, E, T, U, P
   But does it have N? No. We must include N? Because it is known to be in the word? 

 So we have to include N? 

 Therefore, we must choose a word that has both N and E? 

 And without C, R, A? 

 Let me consider ""STONE"": 
   S, T, O, N, E -> 
     Positions:
       1: S
       2: T
       3: O
       4: N -> but we cannot put N at position 4! So invalid.

 ""STONE"" has N at position 4 -> forbidden? 

 So we need a word that has N and E? And N not at position 4? E not at position 5? 

 Possibilities:
   N at positions: 1, 2, 3, 5? 
   E at positions: 1, 2, 3, 4?

 I think ""STEIN"" (which is S T E I N) is acceptable: 
   N is at position 5 -> not position 4 -> okay? 
   E is at position 3 -> not position 5? -> okay? 

 Similarly, ""SENT"" with an added letter? ""SENT"" is 4 letters? 

 ""SENTI"" (a word? Not really?) -> let's not.

 How about ""LEMON"": has L, E, M, O, N -> 
   Positions:
     1: L
     2: E -> E allowed at 2? yes
     3: M
     4: O -> ? 
     5: N -> N allowed at 5? yes.

 So E at position 2? and N at position 5? 

 Another: ""MINCE"" -> but has C? C is excluded? So we cannot use C.

 We have to avoid C, R, A.

 ""NOISE"": 
   N, O, I, S, E -> 
   Positions: 
     1: N -> allowed? (N not at position 4? yes)
     2: O
     3: I
     4: S
     5: E -> but E was previously not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? 

 So ""NOISE"" invalid? Because E is at position 5? 

 Therefore, we need to rearrange? How about ""ENVOY""?
   E, N, V, O, Y -> 
   Positions:
     1: E -> allowed? (E can be at 1? yes)
     2: N -> allowed? (N not at 4? yes)
     3: V
     4: O
     5: Y

 This word has E and N? And avoids the forbidden positions? Yes.

 But common? Okay, it's acceptable? 

 However, I want to test as many common letters as possible? 

 Another word: ""BEING"": 
   B, E, I, N, G -> 
   Positions:
     1: B
     2: E -> E at position 2: allowed
     3: I
     4: N -> wait, N at position 4? We know N is not at position 4? So we are putting N at a known forbidden position? 
        That would yield either a '-' (if the secret word has N elsewhere) or 'x' (if we are mistaken about the presence of N? but we know it's present) -> but we are sure N is present? So it would be '-'. But we don't get new position information? Because we already know position 4 is wrong? 

 We should avoid that? So let me avoid position 4 for N.

 Therefore, ""BEING"" has N at position 4? Avoid.

 How about ""BEGUN"": 
   B, E, G, U, N -> 
   Positions:
     1: B
     2: E -> okay
     3: G
     4: U
     5: N -> okay? 
   So E at position 2, N at position 5? 

 Similarly, ""DEIGN"" (meaning: to condescend) -> 
   D, E, I, G, N -> 
   Positions:
     1: D
     2: E -> okay
     3: I
     4: G
     5: N -> okay.

 But note: if we put E and N only in the positions we know they are allowed? But we have many possibilities? 

 I think ""STEIN"" is a good candidate? Because we have common letters S, T, and I? 

 Alternatively, ""DEIGN"" is a bit uncommon? 

 What about ""KEEN""? No, 4 letters? 

 How about ""QUEEN""? It has two E's? 
   Q, U, E, E, N -> 
   But what positions?
     1: Q
     2: U
     3: E -> okay
     4: E -> but wait, we know E is in the word? But how many? We don't know? 
     5: N -> okay.
   We haven't avoided C, R, A? Yes.
   But we know the secret word has at least one E? Could it have two? We don't know? 

 It's acceptable? 

 However, Q is a rare letter? Might not be good? 

 Another word: ""SPINE"": 
   S, P, I, N, E -> 
   Positions:
     1: S
     2: P
     3: I
     4: N -> wait, position 4: N -> we know N is not at position 4? So avoid.

 So ""SPINE"" invalid? 

 How about ""PINED""? 
   P, I, N, E, D -> 
   Positions:
     1: P
     2: I
     3: N -> okay? (N not at 4? now at 3) 
     4: E -> okay? (E not at 5? now at 4)
     5: D
   So N at position 3? Allowed? E at position 4? Allowed? 

 So ""PINED"" seems good? 

 We haven't used any of the excluded letters? 

 But wait, we have E at position 4? Previously we had E at position 5? Now we put at 4? We'll see if that's correct? 

 And N at position 3? Previously at position 4? Now at 3? 

 We'll get information about P, I, D? 

 Alternatively, ""DINED"": 
   D, I, N, E, D -> wait, repeated D? Or ""DINES"": 
   D, I, N, E, S -> 
   Positions:
     1: D
     2: I
     3: N -> okay
     4: E -> okay
     5: S

 I think I'll go with ""STEIN"":

   S, T, E, I, N

   Because it uses common letters? 

   But note: if we get feedback for E at position 3? If E isn't at position 3? Then we know E is elsewhere? 

   Similarly, N at position 5? 

   Also, T and I are new? 

   We are using S? Which was not used before? 

   So let me choose ""STEIN"".

 If I choose ""STEIN"", and the secret word does not have T? Then we'll know.

 We have 6 tries? So we can iterate.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""STEIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, R, A are **not** in the secret word.  
- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (N was position 4, E was position 5).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include N and E (since they are in the secret word).  
- N cannot be in position 4 (from feedback).  
- E cannot be in position 5 (from feedback).  
- Avoid C, R, A.  

After evaluating options:  
- ""STEIN"" is chosen (common letters, tests positions effectively).  
  - S, T, E, I, N: New consonants and vowel tested.  
  - E is in position 3 (allowed position).  
  - N is in position 5 (allowed position).",Guess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,needy,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has a good mix of common letters. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(-) -> N is in the word but in the wrong position.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So we know:
 - The secret word contains N and E, but not in the positions they were guessed.
 - The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions, and considering the positions in ""crane"":
   N was in the 4th position -> so N cannot be in the 4th position of the secret word.
   E was in the 5th position -> so E cannot be in the 5th position of the secret word.

 We also know the secret word has 5 letters and we have to come up with a new guess.

 We must avoid using C, R, A.

 Let's think of words that contain N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

 Possible letters: We have many letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5.

 We need to choose a word that has N and E in positions other than 4 and 5 respectively? Actually, N could be in any position except 4, and E in any position except 5.

 But note: the feedback for N was ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. Similarly for E.

 Since we have two letters that must be included: N and E.

 We can try to pick a word that has N and E, and then other common letters.

 Example: ""LENIS"" (meaning: a musical term) but let's think of more common words.

 Alternatively: ""STEIN"" -> S T E I N.

 Let me check: 
   Position 1: S -> might be okay? 
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: E -> note that E was in the wrong position? It was previously in position 5, now we put it in position 3 -> that's allowed.
   Position 4: I
   Position 5: N -> but wait: N was in position 4 in the first guess and was wrong. Now we put it in position 5 -> that is allowed? The feedback said N is in the word but not at position 4. Position 5 is different, so it could be.

 However, note that E cannot be in position 5? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Similarly, N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 So in ""STEIN"": 
   E is in position 3 -> allowed.
   N is in position 5 -> allowed.

 But we don't know if S, T, I are in the word? We haven't ruled them out.

 We must avoid using C, R, A.

 Another idea: since the word must have N and E, let's try ""MEAN"" but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

 Example 5-letter words: ""MEANT"" -> wait, but it has A? A is not allowed because we know A is not in the secret word.

 Similarly, ""MEANS"" -> has A again? No, ""MEANS"" has M, E, A, N, S -> A is present which we know is absent. So we cannot use A.

 Let me try to think of words without C, R, A, and that contain N and E.

 Possible words: 
   ""SLEET"" -> but L and T are new? But note: does it contain N? No, it doesn't.
   ""STEEN"" -> not common? 
   ""STEIN"" is acceptable? It's a word meaning a beer mug or a musical note.

 Another word: ""SPEND"" -> has S, P, E, N, D.

 How about ""SPINE""? But ""SPINE"" has I and P? Let me list: S, P, I, N, E.

 But note: E is in position 5? Wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5.

 So in ""SPINE"", E is at position 5 -> not allowed? Because the secret word does not have E at position 5? Therefore, we cannot use words with E at the end (position 5).

 In ""STEIN"", E is at position 3 -> good.

 Another option: ""SNIDE"" -> E is at position 5 -> not allowed? So we must avoid E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""STEIN"" seems okay: 
  S, T, E, I, N -> positions 1: S, 2: T, 3: E, 4: I, 5: N.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SETON"" (a word in anatomy) but less common.

 Or ""LINEN"": 
   L, I, N, E, N -> wait, has two Ns? 
   Positions: 
      1: L
      2: I
      3: N -> but we know N cannot be at position 4? What about position 3? Feedback: N was previously in position 4 and was incorrect. But that doesn't say anything about position 3? So position 3 is allowed. 
      4: E -> but E is now in position 4 (was previously not in position 5). Position 4 is allowed? Yes, because E can be anywhere except position 5.
   But note: the secret word contains one N? Or two? We don't know. But ""LINEN"" has two N's? So if the secret word has two N's? But we have only one N reported? The feedback for ""crane"" had one N and it was marked as present. So the secret word has at least one N. But it might have more? However, the feedback doesn't tell us how many, so we cannot assume only one.

 However, in ""LINEN"", we are placing N at position 3 and position 5. The feedback for ""crane"" only told us that the N was present (but in the wrong position). It could be that the secret word has two N's? Or one? We don't know.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us the frequency, so we have to be cautious.

 Another word: ""KNEEL"" -> but E is in position 3 and 4? And N at position 1? 
   Position 1: K -> okay
   Position 2: N -> okay? N was previously in position 4 and wrong. Now we put it at position 2? That is allowed? Yes.
   Positions 3 and 4: E -> but E can be in positions 1-4? So yes.
   However, we have two E's? And one N.

 This is getting complicated.

 Let me stick to words without repeated letters if possible? To avoid complications.

 How about ""INLET""?
   I, N, L, E, T
   Positions:
     1: I
     2: N -> allowed? (since N cannot be at 4, but 2 is fine)
     3: L
     4: E -> E can be at position 4? (since it cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay)
     5: T

 But wait: E is at position 4 -> which is not position 5 -> acceptable.
 However, we must note: the feedback said that N is not at position 4. We are putting N at position 2 -> okay.

 We don't know about I, L, T? They might be in the word? Or not.

 Alternatively, ""BONES"": 
   B, O, N, E, S -> but O? 
   Positions: 
      1: B
      2: O
      3: N -> N in position 3? Previously was in position 4 and incorrect. Position 3 is okay.
      4: E -> E cannot be in position 5? Position 4 is okay? However, we must note: E was in position 5 before? We are putting it in position 4 -> okay.
   But we have E in position 4 -> okay? Yes.

 However, we are using O? We don't know if O is in the word? It might be.

 But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible? 

 Another word: ""SPEND"": 
   S, P, E, N, D
   Positions:
     1: S
     2: P
     3: E -> E not in position 5 -> okay.
     4: N -> Wait! N in position 4? But the feedback said N cannot be in position 4? So this would be invalid? 
        We know the secret word has N, but not at position 4? So if we put N at position 4, then the feedback would mark it as either:
          - Correct? But the word doesn't have it at position 4? No, we are guessing N at position 4? But actually, the feedback might tell us that it's present but wrong? Or absent? 
        Actually, we know the secret word has N but not in position 4? So if we put N at position 4, it would be marked as wrong (probably ""-"" if the word has N elsewhere? or if it has two Ns? it could be marked as correct? But no) -> 
        Actually, if the secret word has N at position 4, then the feedback in the first guess would have been correct? But it wasn't? So the secret word does not have N at position 4? Therefore, we must not use a word that puts N at position 4? Because it's impossible.

 Therefore, we cannot put N at position 4 in any of our guesses? So ""SPEND"" has N at position 4? That is forbidden? So we must avoid position 4 for N.

 Similarly, we must avoid position 5 for E.

 Therefore, ""SPEND"" is invalid? Because we are putting N at position 4? But the secret word does not have N at position 4? So why put it there? We would get a '-' or 'x'? Actually, we want to get more information? But it's a valid guess? But it's known to be wrong? 

 However, the rules do not forbid guessing the same letter in a position we know is wrong? But it's inefficient? We would be wasting a position? 

 So better to avoid known wrong positions? 

 Therefore, let's avoid putting N at position 4 and E at position 5.

 In ""SPEND"", we have E at position 3 and N at position 4? 
   Position 4: N -> we know the secret word does not have N at position 4? So we would get either:
      - If the secret word has N elsewhere and position 4 is not occupied by N? Then the N in our guess would be marked as '-' meaning present but wrong? 
      - But what if the secret word has two N's? And one of them is at position 4? ... Wait, but we know for sure that position 4 is not N? Because the first guess ""crane"" had N at position 4 and it was not correct? So the secret word does not have N at position 4? Even if it has two N's? 

 Therefore, we will get a '-' for N at position 4? Or if the secret word has only one N and it's not at position 4? Then we get '-'. So we will get '-' for N? Which we already know? We don't gain new information? So it's inefficient? We can do better?

 Alternatively, we can try to put N in a new position? To get more information? So let's avoid position 4 for N? And position 5 for E? 

 So going back to ""STEIN"": 
   S at 1? 
   T at 2?
   E at 3 -> okay (E not at 5)
   I at 4 -> we don't know about position 4? 
   N at 5 -> okay? Because N wasn't at position 4? But position 5 is new? And we don't know? 

 However, note: the secret word has N? So placing N at position 5: if it's correct? Then we get a check? Or if it's wrong? We get '-'.

 And we get information about S, T, I.

 Similarly, we can try ""UNSET"" (meaning: not set) -> 
   U, N, S, E, T
   Positions:
     1: U
     2: N -> okay? (N not at position 4? 2 is new)
     3: S
     4: E -> E cannot be at position 5? Position 4 is okay? 
     5: T

 We avoid E at position 5? So E at 4 -> okay? And N at 2 -> okay? 

 But we are introducing U? 

 Another idea: ""MEANY"" -> but has A? No, A is excluded.

 How about ""SETUP"" -> 
   S, E, T, U, P
   But does it have N? No. We must include N? Because it is known to be in the word? 

 So we have to include N? 

 Therefore, we must choose a word that has both N and E? 

 And without C, R, A? 

 Let me consider ""STONE"": 
   S, T, O, N, E -> 
     Positions:
       1: S
       2: T
       3: O
       4: N -> but we cannot put N at position 4! So invalid.

 ""STONE"" has N at position 4 -> forbidden? 

 So we need a word that has N and E? And N not at position 4? E not at position 5? 

 Possibilities:
   N at positions: 1, 2, 3, 5? 
   E at positions: 1, 2, 3, 4?

 I think ""STEIN"" (which is S T E I N) is acceptable: 
   N is at position 5 -> not position 4 -> okay? 
   E is at position 3 -> not position 5? -> okay? 

 Similarly, ""SENT"" with an added letter? ""SENT"" is 4 letters? 

 ""SENTI"" (a word? Not really?) -> let's not.

 How about ""LEMON"": has L, E, M, O, N -> 
   Positions:
     1: L
     2: E -> E allowed at 2? yes
     3: M
     4: O -> ? 
     5: N -> N allowed at 5? yes.

 So E at position 2? and N at position 5? 

 Another: ""MINCE"" -> but has C? C is excluded? So we cannot use C.

 We have to avoid C, R, A.

 ""NOISE"": 
   N, O, I, S, E -> 
   Positions: 
     1: N -> allowed? (N not at position 4? yes)
     2: O
     3: I
     4: S
     5: E -> but E was previously not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? 

 So ""NOISE"" invalid? Because E is at position 5? 

 Therefore, we need to rearrange? How about ""ENVOY""?
   E, N, V, O, Y -> 
   Positions:
     1: E -> allowed? (E can be at 1? yes)
     2: N -> allowed? (N not at 4? yes)
     3: V
     4: O
     5: Y

 This word has E and N? And avoids the forbidden positions? Yes.

 But common? Okay, it's acceptable? 

 However, I want to test as many common letters as possible? 

 Another word: ""BEING"": 
   B, E, I, N, G -> 
   Positions:
     1: B
     2: E -> E at position 2: allowed
     3: I
     4: N -> wait, N at position 4? We know N is not at position 4? So we are putting N at a known forbidden position? 
        That would yield either a '-' (if the secret word has N elsewhere) or 'x' (if we are mistaken about the presence of N? but we know it's present) -> but we are sure N is present? So it would be '-'. But we don't get new position information? Because we already know position 4 is wrong? 

 We should avoid that? So let me avoid position 4 for N.

 Therefore, ""BEING"" has N at position 4? Avoid.

 How about ""BEGUN"": 
   B, E, G, U, N -> 
   Positions:
     1: B
     2: E -> okay
     3: G
     4: U
     5: N -> okay? 
   So E at position 2, N at position 5? 

 Similarly, ""DEIGN"" (meaning: to condescend) -> 
   D, E, I, G, N -> 
   Positions:
     1: D
     2: E -> okay
     3: I
     4: G
     5: N -> okay.

 But note: if we put E and N only in the positions we know they are allowed? But we have many possibilities? 

 I think ""STEIN"" is a good candidate? Because we have common letters S, T, and I? 

 Alternatively, ""DEIGN"" is a bit uncommon? 

 What about ""KEEN""? No, 4 letters? 

 How about ""QUEEN""? It has two E's? 
   Q, U, E, E, N -> 
   But what positions?
     1: Q
     2: U
     3: E -> okay
     4: E -> but wait, we know E is in the word? But how many? We don't know? 
     5: N -> okay.
   We haven't avoided C, R, A? Yes.
   But we know the secret word has at least one E? Could it have two? We don't know? 

 It's acceptable? 

 However, Q is a rare letter? Might not be good? 

 Another word: ""SPINE"": 
   S, P, I, N, E -> 
   Positions:
     1: S
     2: P
     3: I
     4: N -> wait, position 4: N -> we know N is not at position 4? So avoid.

 So ""SPINE"" invalid? 

 How about ""PINED""? 
   P, I, N, E, D -> 
   Positions:
     1: P
     2: I
     3: N -> okay? (N not at 4? now at 3) 
     4: E -> okay? (E not at 5? now at 4)
     5: D
   So N at position 3? Allowed? E at position 4? Allowed? 

 So ""PINED"" seems good? 

 We haven't used any of the excluded letters? 

 But wait, we have E at position 4? Previously we had E at position 5? Now we put at 4? We'll see if that's correct? 

 And N at position 3? Previously at position 4? Now at 3? 

 We'll get information about P, I, D? 

 Alternatively, ""DINED"": 
   D, I, N, E, D -> wait, repeated D? Or ""DINES"": 
   D, I, N, E, S -> 
   Positions:
     1: D
     2: I
     3: N -> okay
     4: E -> okay
     5: S

 I think I'll go with ""STEIN"":

   S, T, E, I, N

   Because it uses common letters? 

   But note: if we get feedback for E at position 3? If E isn't at position 3? Then we know E is elsewhere? 

   Similarly, N at position 5? 

   Also, T and I are new? 

   We are using S? Which was not used before? 

   So let me choose ""STEIN"".

 If I choose ""STEIN"", and the secret word does not have T? Then we'll know.

 We have 6 tries? So we can iterate.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""STEIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, R, A are **not** in the secret word.  
- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (N was position 4, E was position 5).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include N and E (since they are in the secret word).  
- N cannot be in position 4 (from feedback).  
- E cannot be in position 5 (from feedback).  
- Avoid C, R, A.  

After evaluating options:  
- ""STEIN"" is chosen (common letters, tests positions effectively).  
  - S, T, E, I, N: New consonants and vowel tested.  
  - E is in position 3 (allowed position).  
  - N is in position 5 (allowed position).

We haven\'t ruled them out.\n\n We must avoid using C, R, A.\n\n Another idea: since the word must have N and E, let\'s try ""MEAN"" but that\'s 4 letters?

No, ""MEANS"" has M, E, A, N, S -> A is present which we know is absent. So we cannot use A.\n\n Let me try to think of words without C, R, A, and that contain N and E.\n\n Possible words: \n   ""SLEET"" -> but L and T are new? But note: does it contain N? No, it doesn\'t.\n   ""STEEN"" -> not common? \n   ""STEIN"" is acceptable? It\'s a word meaning a beer mug or a musical note.\n\n Another word: ""SPEND"" -> has S, P, E, N, D.\n\n How about ""SPINE""? But ""SPINE"" has I and P? Let me list: S, P, I, N, E.\n\n But note: E is in position 5? Wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5.\n\n So in ""SPINE"", E is at position 5 -> not allowed? Because the secret word does not have E at position 5? Therefore, we cannot use words with E at the end (position 5).\n\n In ""STEIN"", E is at position 3 -> good.\n\n Another option: ""SNIDE"" -> E is at position 5 -> not allowed? So we must avoid E at position 5.\n\n Therefore, ""STEIN"" seems okay: \n  S, T, E, I, N -> positions 1: S, 2: T, 3: E, 4: I, 5: N.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SETON"" (a word in anatomy) but less common.\n\n Or ""LINEN"": \n   L, I, N, E, N -> wait, has two Ns? \n   Positions: \n      1: L\n      2: I\n      3: N -> but we know N cannot be at position 4? What about position 3? Feedback: N was previously in position 4 and was incorrect. But that doesn\'t say anything about position 3? So position 3 is allowed. \n      4: E -> but E is now in position 4 (was previously not in position 5). Position 4 is allowed? Yes, because E can be anywhere except position 5.\n   But note: the secret word contains one N? Or two? We don\'t know. But ""LINEN"" has two N\'s? So if the secret word has two N\'s? But we have only one N reported? The feedback for ""crane"" had one N and it was marked as present. So the secret word has at least one N. But it might have more? However, the feedback doesn\'t tell us how many, so we cannot assume only one.\n\n However, in ""LINEN"", we are placing N at position 3 and position 5. The feedback for ""crane"" only told us that the N was present (but in the wrong position). It could be that the secret word has two N\'s? Or one? We don\'t know.\n\n But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us the frequency, so we have to be cautious.\n\n Another word: ""KNEEL"" -> but E is in position 3 and 4? And N at position 1? \n   Position 1: K -> okay\n   Position 2: N -> okay? N was previously in position 4 and wrong. Now we put it at position 2? That is allowed? Yes.\n   Positions 3 and 4: E -> but E can be in positions 1-4? So yes.\n   However, we have two E\'s?

(since it cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay)\n     5: T\n\n But wait: E is at position 4 -> which is not position 5 -> acceptable.\n However, we must note: the feedback said that N is not at position 4. We are putting N at position 2 -> okay.\n\n We don\'t know about I, L, T? They might be in the word? Or not.\n\n Alternatively, ""BONES"": \n   B, O, N, E, S -> but O? \n   Positions: \n      1: B\n      2: O\n      3: N -> N in position 3? Previously was in position 4 and incorrect. Position 3 is okay.\n      4: E -> E cannot be in position 5? Position 4 is okay? However, we must note: E was in position 5 before?

It might be.\n\n But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible? \n\n Another word: ""SPEND"": \n   S, P, E, N, D\n   Positions:\n     1: S\n     2: P\n     3: E -> E not in position 5 -> okay.\n     4: N -> Wait! N in position 4? But the feedback said N cannot be in position 4? So this would be invalid? \n        We know the secret word has N, but not at position 4? So if we put N at position 4, then the feedback would mark it as either:\n          - Correct? But the word doesn\'t have it at position 4? No, we are guessing N at position 4? But actually, the feedback might tell us that it\'s present but wrong? Or absent? \n        Actually, we know the secret word has N but not in position 4? So if we put N at position 4, it would be marked as wrong (probably ""-"" if the word has N elsewhere? or if it has two Ns? it could be marked as correct? But no) -> \n        Actually, if the secret word has N at position 4, then the feedback in the first guess would have been correct? But it wasn\'t? So the secret word does not have N at position 4? Therefore, we must not use a word that puts N at position 4? Because it\'s impossible.\n\n Therefore, we cannot put N at position 4 in any of our guesses? So ""SPEND"" has N at position 4? That is forbidden? So we must avoid position 4 for N.\n\n Similarly, we must avoid position 5 for E.\n\n Therefore, ""SPEND"" is invalid? Because we are putting N at position 4? But the secret word does not have N at position 4? So why put it there? We would get a \'-\' or \'x\'? Actually, we want to get more information? But it\'s a valid guess? But it\'s known to be wrong? \n\n However, the rules do not forbid guessing the same letter in a position we know is wrong? But it\'s inefficient? We would be wasting a position? \n\n So better to avoid known wrong positions? \n\n Therefore, let\'s avoid putting N at position 4 and E at position 5.\n\n In ""SPEND"", we have E at position 3 and N at position 4? \n   Position 4: N -> we know the secret word does not have N at position 4? So we would get either:\n      - If the secret word has N elsewhere and position 4 is not occupied by N? Then the N in our guess would be marked as \'-\' meaning present but wrong? \n      - But what if the secret word has two N\'s? And one of them is at position 4? ... Wait, but we know for sure that position 4 is not N? Because the first guess ""crane"" had N at position 4 and it was not correct? So the secret word does not have N at position 4? Even if it has two N\'s? \n\n Therefore, we will get a \'-\' for N at position 4? Or if the secret word has only one N and it\'s not at position 4? Then we get \'-\'. So we will get \'-\' for N? Which we already know? We don\'t gain new information? So it\'s inefficient? We can do better?\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put N in a new position? To get more information? So let\'s avoid position 4 for N? And position 5 for E? \n\n So going back to ""STEIN"": \n   S at 1? \n   T at 2?\n   E at 3 -> okay (E not at 5)\n   I at 4 -> we don\'t know about position 4? \n   N at 5 -> okay? Because N wasn\'t at position 4? But position 5 is new? And we don\'t know? \n\n However, note: the secret word has N? So placing N at position 5: if it\'s correct? Then we get a check? Or if it\'s wrong? We get \'-\'.\n\n And we get information about S, T, I.\n\n Similarly, we can try ""UNSET"" (meaning: not set) -> \n   U, N, S, E, T\n   Positions:\n     1: U\n     2: N -> okay?

(N not at position 4? yes)\n     2: O\n     3: I\n     4: S\n     5: E -> but E was previously not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? \n\n So ""NOISE"" invalid? Because E is at position 5? \n\n Therefore, we need to rearrange? How about ""ENVOY""?\n   E, N, V, O, Y -> \n   Positions:\n     1: E -> allowed? (E can be at 1? yes)\n     2: N -> allowed? (N not at 4? yes)\n     3: V\n     4: O\n     5: Y\n\n This word has E and N? And avoids the forbidden positions? Yes.\n\n But common? Okay, it\'s acceptable? \n\n However, I want to test as many common letters as possible? \n\n Another word: ""BEING"": \n   B, E, I, N, G -> \n   Positions:\n     1: B\n     2: E -> E at position 2: allowed\n     3: I\n     4: N -> wait, N at position 4? We know N is not at position 4? So we are putting N at a known forbidden position? \n        That would yield either a \'-\' (if the secret word has N elsewhere) or \'x\' (if we are mistaken about the presence of N? but we know it\'s present) -> but we are sure N is present? So it would be \'-\'. But we don\'t get new position information? Because we already know position 4 is wrong? \n\n We should avoid that? So let me avoid position 4 for N.\n\n Therefore, ""BEING"" has N at position 4? Avoid.\n\n How about ""BEGUN"": \n   B, E, G, U, N -> \n   Positions:\n     1: B\n     2: E -> okay\n     3: G\n     4: U\n     5: N -> okay? \n   So E at position 2, N at position 5? \n\n Similarly, ""DEIGN"" (meaning: to condescend) -> \n   D, E, I, G, N -> \n   Positions:\n     1: D\n     2: E -> okay\n     3: I\n     4: G\n     5: N -> okay.\n\n But note: if we put E and N only in the positions we know they are allowed? But we have many possibilities? \n\n I think ""STEIN"" is a good candidate? Because we have common letters S, T, and I? \n\n Alternatively, ""DEIGN"" is a bit uncommon? \n\n What about ""KEEN""? No, 4 letters? \n\n How about ""QUEEN""? It has two E\'s? \n   Q, U, E, E, N -> \n   But what positions?\n     1: Q\n     2: U\n     3: E -> okay\n     4: E -> but wait, we know E is in the word? But how many? We don\'t know? \n     5: N -> okay.\n   We haven\'t avoided C, R, A? Yes.\n   But we know the secret word has at least one E? Could it have two? We don\'t know? \n\n It\'s acceptable? \n\n However, Q is a rare letter? Might not be good? \n\n Another word: ""SPINE"": \n   S, P, I, N, E -> \n   Positions:\n     1: S\n     2: P\n     3: I\n     4: N -> wait, position 4: N -> we know N is not at position 4? So avoid.\n\n So ""SPINE"" invalid? \n\n How about ""PINED""? \n   P, I, N, E, D -> \n   Positions:\n     1: P\n     2: I\n     3: N -> okay? (N not at 4? now at 3) \n     4: E -> okay? (E not at 5? now at 4)\n     5: D\n   So N at position 3? Allowed? E at position 4? Allowed? \n\n So ""PINED"" seems good? \n\n We haven\'t used any of the excluded letters? \n\n But wait, we have E at position 4? Previously we had E at position 5? Now we put at 4? We\'ll see if that\'s correct? \n\n And N at position 3? Previously at position 4? Now at 3? \n\n We\'ll get information about P, I, D? \n\n Alternatively, ""DINED"": \n   D, I, N, E, D -> wait, repeated D? Or ""DINES"": \n   D, I, N, E, S -> \n   Positions:\n     1: D\n     2: I\n     3: N -> okay\n     4: E -> okay\n     5: S\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""STEIN"":\n\n   S, T, E, I, N\n\n   Because it uses common letters? \n\n   But note: if we get feedback for E at position 3? If E isn\'t at position 3? Then we know E is elsewhere? \n\n   Similarly, N at position 5? \n\n   Also, T and I are new? \n\n   We are using S? Which was not used before? \n\n   So let me choose ""STEIN"".\n\n If I choose ""STEIN"", and the secret word does not have T? Then we\'ll know.\n\n We have 6 tries? So we can iterate.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll go with ""STEIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C, R, A are **not** in the secret word.  \n- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (N was position 4, E was position 5).  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Must include N and E (since they are in the secret word).  \n- N cannot be in position 4 (from feedback).  \n- E cannot be in position 5 (from feedback).  \n- Avoid C, R, A.  \n\nAfter evaluating options:  \n- ""STEIN"" is chosen (common letters, tests positions effectively).  \n  - S, T, E, I, N: New consonants and vowel tested.  \n  - E is in position 3 (allowed position).  \n  - N is in position 5 (allowed position).\n\n<guess>stein</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""stein"" -> Feedback: S(x) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(-)
Meaning:
- S, T, I are not in the secret word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since ""stein"" is S-T-E-I-N, so E is the third letter).
- N is in the word but not in position 5 (because it's marked as present but wrong position).

So, combining the information:

1. The secret word contains E and N (from both guesses).
2. E is in position 3 (from the second guess: E(✓)).
3. N is in the word but not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). Therefore, N must be in position 1, 2, or 3? But wait, position 3 is already taken by E? So N cannot be in position 3? Therefore, N must be in position 1 or 2.

Let's list the positions:

Position 1: ? (cannot be C, R, A, S, T, I, and also note that N could be here? But we don't know yet)
Position 2: ? (same exclusions, and N could be here)
Position 3: E (fixed, because we have E(✓) in the second guess)
Position 4: ? (cannot be C, R, A, S, T, I, and also note: we know N is not in position 4 from the first guess? But we already have that. Also, from the second guess, we have I(x) at position 4? So position 4 is not I, but we don't know what it is)
Position 5: ? (cannot be C, R, A, S, T, I, and also E is not in position 5? But we know E is in position 3, so position 5 is free. Also, N is not in position 5? So position 5 is not N)

So, to summarize:

- The secret word has E in position 3.
- The secret word has N, but not in positions 4 or 5. And since position 3 is taken by E, N must be in position 1 or 2.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, S, T, I.

Also, we have two letters that are present: E and N. We know E is at position 3, and N is at either 1 or 2.

Now, we need to make a new guess. We should try to determine the position of N and also find the other letters.

We know the word has 5 letters. We know position 3 is E. Position 1 and 2: one of them is N? Or could there be another letter? But we know N is present and must be in 1 or 2.

So the word looks like:

Option A: N _ E _ _
Option B: _ N E _ _

But note: we don't know if there are other letters? We have to fill the rest.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, S, T, I.

We need to choose a word that has E in position 3, and includes N in either position 1 or 2? Actually, we don't have to include N in the guess? But we know N is in the word, so we can use that to our advantage? However, we are trying to find the exact position of N? So we should try to test one of the possibilities.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in position 1 and then other new letters? Or in position 2? 

But note: we have 4 more guesses? So we can try to pin down the position of N.

We can also try to use a word that has N in position 1 and then see the feedback? Or in position 2? 

But we also need to test other letters? 

Let me think of words that have E in position 3 and N in position 1 or 2? 

First, if N is in position 1:

Pattern: N ? E ? ?

We need to fill the second, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not C, R, A, S, T, I.

Similarly, if N is in position 2:

Pattern: ? N E ? ?

We can try to guess a word that fits one of these patterns? 

But we don't know which pattern? So we can choose a word that has N in position 1? Then if we get feedback that N is correct? Then we know it's in position 1? Otherwise, if we get that N is present but wrong? Then it must be in position 2? Because those are the only two possibilities? 

But wait: if we put N in position 1 and it is actually in position 2? Then the feedback for N would be '-' meaning present but wrong? And then we would know N is in position 2? 

Similarly, if we put N in position 2 and it is actually in position 1? Then we get '-' for N? 

But we can also try to cover both possibilities? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have N in position 1 or 2? But that would be inefficient? Because we know N is in the word? So we should use it? 

But if we put N in a position we know it cannot be? For example, if we put N in position 4? We know it's not there? Then we get a '-'? Which we already know? So that's not helpful? 

So we should put N in either position 1 or 2? 

Let me choose to put N in position 1? Then we can test that? 

So pattern: N ? E ? ?

We need to choose the other letters? We want to test as many new letters as possible? 

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C, R, A, S, T, I)

Common letters: L, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

Example words:

- ""N O E L"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5? So ""NOEL"" is 4? 

- ""N I E C E"" -> but I and C are excluded? 

- ""N A K E D"" -> A is excluded? 

- ""N U D G E"" -> 
   N, U, D, G, E -> but E is at position 5? But we need E at position 3? 

We need E at position 3? 

So let me try: 

Position 1: N
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: E (fixed in our pattern? But wait, in the word we are guessing, we are going to put E at position 3? But the secret word has E at position 3? So we can put E at position 3? 

But note: we are going to get a check for E at position 3? So we don't need to worry? 

But we are trying to find the other letters? 

So for the pattern N ? E ? ? 

We can have:

- ""N O E W S"" -> but S is excluded? 

- ""N O E L L"" -> not 5? 

- ""N O E B S"" -> S excluded? 

- ""N O E D"" -> 4 letters? 

- ""N O E V E"" -> E at the end? But we have E at position 3 and 5? 

How about ""NOVEL""? 
   N, O, V, E, L -> 
   Positions: 
      1: N
      2: O
      3: V -> but we need E at position 3? 

We cannot change the E? The secret word has E at position 3? So in our guess, we must put E at position 3? 

So the pattern is: 
   Position 1: N
   Position 2: ? (a new letter)
   Position 3: E (we must put E here? because we know it's correct? and we want to confirm? Actually, we know it's correct? So we can put E at 3? 
   But note: we are going to get a check for E at 3? So we can use that to our advantage? 

But we don't have to? We can put a different letter at 3? But that would be inefficient? Because we know E is at 3? So we should put E at 3? 

Therefore, the guess must have E at position 3? 

So for the pattern: N ? E ? ? 

We need to choose letters for positions 2, 4, and 5? 

Similarly, if we choose the other pattern: ? N E ? ? 

But let's stick to testing N at position 1? 

So: N (position1) + E (position3) 

We need a word: N ? E ? ? 

Examples:

- ""N U E D O"" -> not a word? 

- ""N I E L D"" -> I excluded? 

- ""N A E V E"" -> A excluded? 

- ""N O E L S"" -> S excluded? 

- ""N O E B B"" -> not a word? 

- ""N O E D G"" -> not a word? 

- ""N O E Y D"" -> not a word? 

- ""N O E W D"" -> not a word? 

How about ""N O M E N"" -> 
   N, O, M, E, N -> 
   Positions: 
      1: N
      2: O
      3: M -> but we need E at position 3? 

We cannot put M at position 3? We must put E at position 3? 

So the word must have E at position 3? 

Therefore, the word is: N (1), ? (2), E (3), ? (4), ? (5)

So we need a word that starts with N, has E at the third position? 

Examples:

- ""N I E S T"" -> but I and S and T excluded? 

- ""N U E B A"" -> A excluded? 

- ""N U E L L"" -> not 5? 

- ""N I E V E"" -> I excluded? 

- ""N A E W S"" -> A and S excluded? 

- ""N O E L L"" -> not 5? 

- ""N O E D"" -> 4? 

- ""N O E V E"" -> but then positions: 
   N, O, E, V, E -> 
   Position 1: N
   Position 2: O
   Position 3: E -> good
   Position 4: V
   Position 5: E

But is ""NOVEE"" a word? No? 

How about ""NOEUD""? (a knot? from French) -> 
   N, O, E, U, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: O
      3: E -> good
      4: U
      5: D

But is ""NOEUD"" an English word? It might be accepted? But it's not common? 

Alternatively, ""NUKED"": 
   N, U, K, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: U
      3: K -> but we need E at 3? 

We cannot put K at 3? We must put E at 3? 

So we need the third letter to be E? 

Another word: ""NEVER"": 
   N, E, V, E, R -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: E -> but we are trying to put E at 3? 
   But we can shift? 
   But we need E at 3? 

How about ""NEEDS"": 
   N, E, E, D, S -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: E
      3: E -> but we are putting E at 3? 
   But S is excluded? 

And also, we have two E's? 

But the secret word has at least one E? But we don't know about two? 

But S is excluded? 

So not valid? 

Another idea: ""NEXUS"": 
   N, E, X, U, S -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: E
      3: X -> but we need E at 3? 

We cannot? 

We need a word that has the third letter as E? 

Let me search for words that start with N and have E as the third letter? 

Examples: 
   ""N A E V E"" -> not valid? 
   ""N I E L D"" -> I excluded? 
   ""N O E L"" -> 4 letters? 
   ""N U E L"" -> 4? 
   ""N I E V E"" -> I excluded? 
   ""N O E D"" -> 4? 
   ""N O E S"" -> 4? 

How about ""NOMEN""? (as in nomen? meaning a name in Latin) -> 
   N, O, M, E, N -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: O
      3: M -> not E? 

We need the third letter to be E? 

Another: ""NUDGE"": 
   N, U, D, G, E -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: U
      3: D -> not E? 

We are stuck? 

Perhaps we should consider the other pattern: with N in position 2? 

Pattern: ? N E ? ? 

So the word has: 
   Position 1: ? 
   Position 2: N
   Position 3: E
   Position 4: ?
   Position 5: ?

And we know the secret word has E at position 3? 

So we can guess a word with N at position 2 and E at position 3? 

Examples:

- ""U N E D O"" -> not a word? 

- ""B N E E D"" -> not? 

- ""D N E E D"" -> not? 

- ""L N E D S"" -> not? 

- ""M N E W S"" -> not? 

- ""P N E U M"" -> not 5? 

- ""U N E A R"" -> R excluded? 

- ""U N E D G"" -> not a word? 

- ""U N I T E"" -> but I excluded? 

- ""U N T E N"" -> T excluded? 

- ""U N D E E"" -> not? 

- ""U N D E R"" -> R excluded? 

- ""U N L E S"" -> S excluded? 

- ""U N M E T"" -> T excluded? 

- ""U N Z I P"" -> I excluded? 

- ""B O N E D"" -> 
   B, O, N, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: B
      2: O -> but we need N at position 2? 

We need N at position 2? 

So the word must have N at position 2 and E at position 3? 

Examples:

- ""B N E E P"" -> not a word? 

- ""C N E W S"" -> C excluded? 

- ""D N E E D"" -> not? 

- ""F N E S T"" -> S and T excluded? 

- ""G N E W S"" -> S excluded? 

- ""H N E S S"" -> S excluded? 

- ""K N E E D"" -> 
   K, N, E, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: K
      2: N -> good
      3: E -> good
      4: E
      5: D

But is ""KNEED"" a word? Yes, meaning having knees or to knee? 

And it has E at position 3? 

Also, we are using K, N, E, E, D? 

We avoid C, R, A, S, T, I? 

So ""KNEED"" is a valid guess? 

But note: we have two E's? 

The secret word has at least one E? But we don't know about two? 

Also, we are putting N at position 2? If the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get a check? If not? Then we get '-' and we know N is at position 1? 

But in this guess, we are also testing K and D? 

Another word: ""KNELT"": 
   K, N, E, L, T -> 
   But T is excluded? 

So not valid? 

Another: ""KNEAD"": 
   K, N, E, A, D -> 
   But A is excluded? 

So not valid? 

Another: ""GNOME"": 
   G, N, O, M, E -> 
   Positions:
      1: G
      2: N -> good
      3: O -> but we need E at position 3? 

We cannot? 

So ""KNEED"" seems like a possibility? 

But let me check if there are other words? 

""ONERY"" (variant of ornery) -> 
   O, N, E, R, Y -> 
   But R is excluded? 

""INEPT"": I excluded? 

""UNETH"": not common? 

""JNEOU"": not a word? 

So ""KNEED"" might be acceptable? 

But we have to consider: if we put N at position 2? And if the secret word has N at position 1? Then we will get feedback for N at position 2 as '-'? And we will know N is at position 1? 

Similarly, if N is at position 2? Then we get a check? 

Also, we are testing K at position 1 and D at position 5? 

But note: the secret word has E at position 3? So we are not testing that? 

Another word: ""DWINE"" (archaic for waste away) -> 
   D, W, I, N, E -> 
   But I is excluded? 

""OWLED"": 
   O, W, L, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: O
      2: W
      3: L -> not E? 

We need E at position 3? 

So I think ""KNEED"" is a candidate? 

But let me think of a more common word? 

How about ""QUEEN""? 
   Q, U, E, E, N -> 
   Positions:
      1: Q
      2: U
      3: E -> good
      4: E
      5: N

But we are not putting N at position 2? We are putting it at position 5? But we know N is not at position 5? So we would be putting N at a position we know it's not? 

So feedback for N at position 5 would be '-'? Which we already know? So it's inefficient? 

We should avoid that? 

Therefore, ""KNEED"" is better? 

Another word: ""BLEED"": 
   B, L, E, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: B
      2: L
      3: E -> good
      4: E
      5: D

But we are not testing N? We know N is in the word? But we are not including N in the guess? That's allowed? But we won't get information about N? 

We know N is in the word? So if we don't include N? Then we get no feedback on N? And we still don't know if it's at position 1 or 2? 

So that's not good? We should include N? 

Therefore, we must include N in the guess? 

So ""KNEED"" includes N at position 2? 

Another word: ""NEEDY"": 
   N, E, E, D, Y -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: E -> but we need E at position 3? 
   So not? 

""ENDED"": 
   E, N, D, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: E -> but we are not sure if E can be at 1? But we know E is at 3? So we cannot put E at 1? 
   And also, we are not putting E at 3? 

So not? 

I think ""KNEED"" is a good choice? 

But let's confirm the letters: K, N, E, E, D

We avoid C, R, A, S, T, I? Yes.

So I'll go with ""KNEED"".

But note: we are putting two E's? The secret word might have only one E? But we don't know? 

If the secret word has only one E, then the E at position 4 would be marked as 'x'? Or '-'? 

Since we have E at position 3 which is correct? And at position 4? If the secret word has only one E? Then the E at position 4 would be marked as 'x'? 

But we know the secret word has at least one E? 

Similarly, for N: we are putting N at position 2? 

So feedback will tell us if N is at position 2 or not? 

Therefore, I choose ""KNEED"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  
  - **C, R, A** are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - **N** is present but **not in position 4**.  
  - **E** is present but **not in position 5**.  

- **Guess 2: ""stein""** → S(x), T(x), E(✓), I(x), N(-)  
  - **S, T, I** are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - **E** is **correct and in position 3** (confirmed).  
  - **N** is present but **not in position 5**.  

### Key Insights
1. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - **E** is fixed in **position 3** (from ""stein"" feedback).  
   - **N** is present but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from both guesses). Since position 3 is occupied by E, **N must be in position 1 or 2**.  
   
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T, I.  
   - Remaining letters to use: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

3. **Word structure**:  
   - Position 3 is **E** (fixed).  
   - Positions 1 and 2: One of them is **N** (the other is unknown).  
   - Positions 4 and 5: Unknown letters (not N, E, or absent letters).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Test the position of N**: Since N must be in position 1 or 2, prioritize a word that places N in one of these positions to resolve its location.  
- **Maximize new letter coverage**: Use common letters (e.g., K, D, O) to test for presence/absence.  
- **Avoid inefficiency**: Do not reuse known absent letters or place N/E in forbidden positions (e.g., N not in 4/5, E not in 5).  

### Chosen Guess: ""KNEED""
- **Structure**: K N E E D  
  - **Position 1**: K (tests a new letter).  
  - **Position 2**: N (tests if N is in position 2; if not, it must be in position 1).  
  - **Position 3**: E (fixed, will confirm as correct).  
  - **Position 4**: E (tests if there is a second E; if absent, marked ""x"").  
  - **Position 5**: D (tests a new letter).  

- **Why ""KNEED""?**  
  - Efficiently tests N's position (1 or 2) while covering new letters (K, D).  
  - Complies with constraints: no C, R, A, S, T, I; E in position 3; N not in 4/5.  
  - Common word (meaning: to strike with the knee).  

### Expected Outcomes
- If N is in position 2: Feedback will show N(✓).  
- If N is in position 1: Feedback will show N(-) (since it's misplaced in position 2).  
- Feedback for K, D, and the second E will provide new information for subsequent guesses.  

<guess>kneed</guess>",kneed,"We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""stein"" -> Feedback: S(x) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(-)
Meaning:
- S, T, I are not in the secret word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since ""stein"" is S-T-E-I-N, so E is the third letter).
- N is in the word but not in position 5 (because it's marked as present but wrong position).

So, combining the information:

1. The secret word contains E and N (from both guesses).
2. E is in position 3 (from the second guess: E(✓)).
3. N is in the word but not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). Therefore, N must be in position 1, 2, or 3? But wait, position 3 is already taken by E? So N cannot be in position 3? Therefore, N must be in position 1 or 2.

Let's list the positions:

Position 1: ? (cannot be C, R, A, S, T, I, and also note that N could be here? But we don't know yet)
Position 2: ? (same exclusions, and N could be here)
Position 3: E (fixed, because we have E(✓) in the second guess)
Position 4: ? (cannot be C, R, A, S, T, I, and also note: we know N is not in position 4 from the first guess? But we already have that. Also, from the second guess, we have I(x) at position 4? So position 4 is not I, but we don't know what it is)
Position 5: ? (cannot be C, R, A, S, T, I, and also E is not in position 5? But we know E is in position 3, so position 5 is free. Also, N is not in position 5? So position 5 is not N)

So, to summarize:

- The secret word has E in position 3.
- The secret word has N, but not in positions 4 or 5. And since position 3 is taken by E, N must be in position 1 or 2.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, S, T, I.

Also, we have two letters that are present: E and N. We know E is at position 3, and N is at either 1 or 2.

Now, we need to make a new guess. We should try to determine the position of N and also find the other letters.

We know the word has 5 letters. We know position 3 is E. Position 1 and 2: one of them is N? Or could there be another letter? But we know N is present and must be in 1 or 2.

So the word looks like:

Option A: N _ E _ _
Option B: _ N E _ _

But note: we don't know if there are other letters? We have to fill the rest.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, S, T, I.

We need to choose a word that has E in position 3, and includes N in either position 1 or 2? Actually, we don't have to include N in the guess? But we know N is in the word, so we can use that to our advantage? However, we are trying to find the exact position of N? So we should try to test one of the possibilities.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in position 1 and then other new letters? Or in position 2? 

But note: we have 4 more guesses? So we can try to pin down the position of N.

We can also try to use a word that has N in position 1 and then see the feedback? Or in position 2? 

But we also need to test other letters? 

Let me think of words that have E in position 3 and N in position 1 or 2? 

First, if N is in position 1:

Pattern: N ? E ? ?

We need to fill the second, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not C, R, A, S, T, I.

Similarly, if N is in position 2:

Pattern: ? N E ? ?

We can try to guess a word that fits one of these patterns? 

But we don't know which pattern? So we can choose a word that has N in position 1? Then if we get feedback that N is correct? Then we know it's in position 1? Otherwise, if we get that N is present but wrong? Then it must be in position 2? Because those are the only two possibilities? 

But wait: if we put N in position 1 and it is actually in position 2? Then the feedback for N would be '-' meaning present but wrong? And then we would know N is in position 2? 

Similarly, if we put N in position 2 and it is actually in position 1? Then we get '-' for N? 

But we can also try to cover both possibilities? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have N in position 1 or 2? But that would be inefficient? Because we know N is in the word? So we should use it? 

But if we put N in a position we know it cannot be? For example, if we put N in position 4? We know it's not there? Then we get a '-'? Which we already know? So that's not helpful? 

So we should put N in either position 1 or 2? 

Let me choose to put N in position 1? Then we can test that? 

So pattern: N ? E ? ?

We need to choose the other letters? We want to test as many new letters as possible? 

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C, R, A, S, T, I)

Common letters: L, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

Example words:

- ""N O E L"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5? So ""NOEL"" is 4? 

- ""N I E C E"" -> but I and C are excluded? 

- ""N A K E D"" -> A is excluded? 

- ""N U D G E"" -> 
   N, U, D, G, E -> but E is at position 5? But we need E at position 3? 

We need E at position 3? 

So let me try: 

Position 1: N
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: E (fixed in our pattern? But wait, in the word we are guessing, we are going to put E at position 3? But the secret word has E at position 3? So we can put E at position 3? 

But note: we are going to get a check for E at position 3? So we don't need to worry? 

But we are trying to find the other letters? 

So for the pattern N ? E ? ? 

We can have:

- ""N O E W S"" -> but S is excluded? 

- ""N O E L L"" -> not 5? 

- ""N O E B S"" -> S excluded? 

- ""N O E D"" -> 4 letters? 

- ""N O E V E"" -> E at the end? But we have E at position 3 and 5? 

How about ""NOVEL""? 
   N, O, V, E, L -> 
   Positions: 
      1: N
      2: O
      3: V -> but we need E at position 3? 

We cannot change the E? The secret word has E at position 3? So in our guess, we must put E at position 3? 

So the pattern is: 
   Position 1: N
   Position 2: ? (a new letter)
   Position 3: E (we must put E here? because we know it's correct? and we want to confirm? Actually, we know it's correct? So we can put E at 3? 
   But note: we are going to get a check for E at 3? So we can use that to our advantage? 

But we don't have to? We can put a different letter at 3? But that would be inefficient? Because we know E is at 3? So we should put E at 3? 

Therefore, the guess must have E at position 3? 

So for the pattern: N ? E ? ? 

We need to choose letters for positions 2, 4, and 5? 

Similarly, if we choose the other pattern: ? N E ? ? 

But let's stick to testing N at position 1? 

So: N (position1) + E (position3) 

We need a word: N ? E ? ? 

Examples:

- ""N U E D O"" -> not a word? 

- ""N I E L D"" -> I excluded? 

- ""N A E V E"" -> A excluded? 

- ""N O E L S"" -> S excluded? 

- ""N O E B B"" -> not a word? 

- ""N O E D G"" -> not a word? 

- ""N O E Y D"" -> not a word? 

- ""N O E W D"" -> not a word? 

How about ""N O M E N"" -> 
   N, O, M, E, N -> 
   Positions: 
      1: N
      2: O
      3: M -> but we need E at position 3? 

We cannot put M at position 3? We must put E at position 3? 

So the word must have E at position 3? 

Therefore, the word is: N (1), ? (2), E (3), ? (4), ? (5)

So we need a word that starts with N, has E at the third position? 

Examples:

- ""N I E S T"" -> but I and S and T excluded? 

- ""N U E B A"" -> A excluded? 

- ""N U E L L"" -> not 5? 

- ""N I E V E"" -> I excluded? 

- ""N A E W S"" -> A and S excluded? 

- ""N O E L L"" -> not 5? 

- ""N O E D"" -> 4? 

- ""N O E V E"" -> but then positions: 
   N, O, E, V, E -> 
   Position 1: N
   Position 2: O
   Position 3: E -> good
   Position 4: V
   Position 5: E

But is ""NOVEE"" a word? No? 

How about ""NOEUD""? (a knot? from French) -> 
   N, O, E, U, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: O
      3: E -> good
      4: U
      5: D

But is ""NOEUD"" an English word? It might be accepted? But it's not common? 

Alternatively, ""NUKED"": 
   N, U, K, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: U
      3: K -> but we need E at 3? 

We cannot put K at 3? We must put E at 3? 

So we need the third letter to be E? 

Another word: ""NEVER"": 
   N, E, V, E, R -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: E -> but we are trying to put E at 3? 
   But we can shift? 
   But we need E at 3? 

How about ""NEEDS"": 
   N, E, E, D, S -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: E
      3: E -> but we are putting E at 3? 
   But S is excluded? 

And also, we have two E's? 

But the secret word has at least one E? But we don't know about two? 

But S is excluded? 

So not valid? 

Another idea: ""NEXUS"": 
   N, E, X, U, S -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: E
      3: X -> but we need E at 3? 

We cannot? 

We need a word that has the third letter as E? 

Let me search for words that start with N and have E as the third letter? 

Examples: 
   ""N A E V E"" -> not valid? 
   ""N I E L D"" -> I excluded? 
   ""N O E L"" -> 4 letters? 
   ""N U E L"" -> 4? 
   ""N I E V E"" -> I excluded? 
   ""N O E D"" -> 4? 
   ""N O E S"" -> 4? 

How about ""NOMEN""? (as in nomen? meaning a name in Latin) -> 
   N, O, M, E, N -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: O
      3: M -> not E? 

We need the third letter to be E? 

Another: ""NUDGE"": 
   N, U, D, G, E -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: U
      3: D -> not E? 

We are stuck? 

Perhaps we should consider the other pattern: with N in position 2? 

Pattern: ? N E ? ? 

So the word has: 
   Position 1: ? 
   Position 2: N
   Position 3: E
   Position 4: ?
   Position 5: ?

And we know the secret word has E at position 3? 

So we can guess a word with N at position 2 and E at position 3? 

Examples:

- ""U N E D O"" -> not a word? 

- ""B N E E D"" -> not? 

- ""D N E E D"" -> not? 

- ""L N E D S"" -> not? 

- ""M N E W S"" -> not? 

- ""P N E U M"" -> not 5? 

- ""U N E A R"" -> R excluded? 

- ""U N E D G"" -> not a word? 

- ""U N I T E"" -> but I excluded? 

- ""U N T E N"" -> T excluded? 

- ""U N D E E"" -> not? 

- ""U N D E R"" -> R excluded? 

- ""U N L E S"" -> S excluded? 

- ""U N M E T"" -> T excluded? 

- ""U N Z I P"" -> I excluded? 

- ""B O N E D"" -> 
   B, O, N, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: B
      2: O -> but we need N at position 2? 

We need N at position 2? 

So the word must have N at position 2 and E at position 3? 

Examples:

- ""B N E E P"" -> not a word? 

- ""C N E W S"" -> C excluded? 

- ""D N E E D"" -> not? 

- ""F N E S T"" -> S and T excluded? 

- ""G N E W S"" -> S excluded? 

- ""H N E S S"" -> S excluded? 

- ""K N E E D"" -> 
   K, N, E, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: K
      2: N -> good
      3: E -> good
      4: E
      5: D

But is ""KNEED"" a word? Yes, meaning having knees or to knee? 

And it has E at position 3? 

Also, we are using K, N, E, E, D? 

We avoid C, R, A, S, T, I? 

So ""KNEED"" is a valid guess? 

But note: we have two E's? 

The secret word has at least one E? But we don't know about two? 

Also, we are putting N at position 2? If the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get a check? If not? Then we get '-' and we know N is at position 1? 

But in this guess, we are also testing K and D? 

Another word: ""KNELT"": 
   K, N, E, L, T -> 
   But T is excluded? 

So not valid? 

Another: ""KNEAD"": 
   K, N, E, A, D -> 
   But A is excluded? 

So not valid? 

Another: ""GNOME"": 
   G, N, O, M, E -> 
   Positions:
      1: G
      2: N -> good
      3: O -> but we need E at position 3? 

We cannot? 

So ""KNEED"" seems like a possibility? 

But let me check if there are other words? 

""ONERY"" (variant of ornery) -> 
   O, N, E, R, Y -> 
   But R is excluded? 

""INEPT"": I excluded? 

""UNETH"": not common? 

""JNEOU"": not a word? 

So ""KNEED"" might be acceptable? 

But we have to consider: if we put N at position 2? And if the secret word has N at position 1? Then we will get feedback for N at position 2 as '-'? And we will know N is at position 1? 

Similarly, if N is at position 2? Then we get a check? 

Also, we are testing K at position 1 and D at position 5? 

But note: the secret word has E at position 3? So we are not testing that? 

Another word: ""DWINE"" (archaic for waste away) -> 
   D, W, I, N, E -> 
   But I is excluded? 

""OWLED"": 
   O, W, L, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: O
      2: W
      3: L -> not E? 

We need E at position 3? 

So I think ""KNEED"" is a candidate? 

But let me think of a more common word? 

How about ""QUEEN""? 
   Q, U, E, E, N -> 
   Positions:
      1: Q
      2: U
      3: E -> good
      4: E
      5: N

But we are not putting N at position 2? We are putting it at position 5? But we know N is not at position 5? So we would be putting N at a position we know it's not? 

So feedback for N at position 5 would be '-'? Which we already know? So it's inefficient? 

We should avoid that? 

Therefore, ""KNEED"" is better? 

Another word: ""BLEED"": 
   B, L, E, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: B
      2: L
      3: E -> good
      4: E
      5: D

But we are not testing N? We know N is in the word? But we are not including N in the guess? That's allowed? But we won't get information about N? 

We know N is in the word? So if we don't include N? Then we get no feedback on N? And we still don't know if it's at position 1 or 2? 

So that's not good? We should include N? 

Therefore, we must include N in the guess? 

So ""KNEED"" includes N at position 2? 

Another word: ""NEEDY"": 
   N, E, E, D, Y -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: E -> but we need E at position 3? 
   So not? 

""ENDED"": 
   E, N, D, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: E -> but we are not sure if E can be at 1? But we know E is at 3? So we cannot put E at 1? 
   And also, we are not putting E at 3? 

So not? 

I think ""KNEED"" is a good choice? 

But let's confirm the letters: K, N, E, E, D

We avoid C, R, A, S, T, I? Yes.

So I'll go with ""KNEED"".

But note: we are putting two E's? The secret word might have only one E? But we don't know? 

If the secret word has only one E, then the E at position 4 would be marked as 'x'? Or '-'? 

Since we have E at position 3 which is correct? And at position 4? If the secret word has only one E? Then the E at position 4 would be marked as 'x'? 

But we know the secret word has at least one E? 

Similarly, for N: we are putting N at position 2? 

So feedback will tell us if N is at position 2 or not? 

Therefore, I choose ""KNEED"".

<guess>kneed</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  
  - **C, R, A** are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - **N** is present but **not in position 4**.  
  - **E** is present but **not in position 5**.  

- **Guess 2: ""stein""** → S(x), T(x), E(✓), I(x), N(-)  
  - **S, T, I** are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - **E** is **correct and in position 3** (confirmed).  
  - **N** is present but **not in position 5**.  

### Key Insights
1. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - **E** is fixed in **position 3** (from ""stein"" feedback).  
   - **N** is present but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from both guesses). Since position 3 is occupied by E, **N must be in position 1 or 2**.  
   
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T, I.  
   - Remaining letters to use: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

3. **Word structure**:  
   - Position 3 is **E** (fixed).  
   - Positions 1 and 2: One of them is **N** (the other is unknown).  
   - Positions 4 and 5: Unknown letters (not N, E, or absent letters).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Test the position of N**: Since N must be in position 1 or 2, prioritize a word that places N in one of these positions to resolve its location.  
- **Maximize new letter coverage**: Use common letters (e.g., K, D, O) to test for presence/absence.  
- **Avoid inefficiency**: Do not reuse known absent letters or place N/E in forbidden positions (e.g., N not in 4/5, E not in 5).  

### Chosen Guess: ""KNEED""
- **Structure**: K N E E D  
  - **Position 1**: K (tests a new letter).  
  - **Position 2**: N (tests if N is in position 2; if not, it must be in position 1).  
  - **Position 3**: E (fixed, will confirm as correct).  
  - **Position 4**: E (tests if there is a second E; if absent, marked ""x"").  
  - **Position 5**: D (tests a new letter).  

- **Why ""KNEED""?**  
  - Efficiently tests N's position (1 or 2) while covering new letters (K, D).  
  - Complies with constraints: no C, R, A, S, T, I; E in position 3; N not in 4/5.  
  - Common word (meaning: to strike with the knee).  

### Expected Outcomes
- If N is in position 2: Feedback will show N(✓).  
- If N is in position 1: Feedback will show N(-) (since it's misplaced in position 2).  
- Feedback for K, D, and the second E will provide new information for subsequent guesses.",Guess 3: kneed -> FEEDBACK: K(x) N(-) E(✓) E(-) D(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,needy,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has a good mix of common letters. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has 5 distinct letters.
 - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(x) -> R is not in the secret word.
 A(x) -> A is not in the secret word.
 N(-) -> N is in the word but in the wrong position.
 E(-) -> E is in the word but in the wrong position.

 So we know:
 - The secret word contains N and E, but not in the positions they were guessed.
 - The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions, and considering the positions in ""crane"":
   N was in the 4th position -> so N cannot be in the 4th position of the secret word.
   E was in the 5th position -> so E cannot be in the 5th position of the secret word.

 We also know the secret word has 5 letters and we have to come up with a new guess.

 We must avoid using C, R, A.

 Let's think of words that contain N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

 Possible letters: We have many letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5.

 We need to choose a word that has N and E in positions other than 4 and 5 respectively? Actually, N could be in any position except 4, and E in any position except 5.

 But note: the feedback for N was ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. Similarly for E.

 Since we have two letters that must be included: N and E.

 We can try to pick a word that has N and E, and then other common letters.

 Example: ""LENIS"" (meaning: a musical term) but let's think of more common words.

 Alternatively: ""STEIN"" -> S T E I N.

 Let me check: 
   Position 1: S -> might be okay? 
   Position 2: T
   Position 3: E -> note that E was in the wrong position? It was previously in position 5, now we put it in position 3 -> that's allowed.
   Position 4: I
   Position 5: N -> but wait: N was in position 4 in the first guess and was wrong. Now we put it in position 5 -> that is allowed? The feedback said N is in the word but not at position 4. Position 5 is different, so it could be.

 However, note that E cannot be in position 5? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Similarly, N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 So in ""STEIN"": 
   E is in position 3 -> allowed.
   N is in position 5 -> allowed.

 But we don't know if S, T, I are in the word? We haven't ruled them out.

 We must avoid using C, R, A.

 Another idea: since the word must have N and E, let's try ""MEAN"" but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

 Example 5-letter words: ""MEANT"" -> wait, but it has A? A is not allowed because we know A is not in the secret word.

 Similarly, ""MEANS"" -> has A again? No, ""MEANS"" has M, E, A, N, S -> A is present which we know is absent. So we cannot use A.

 Let me try to think of words without C, R, A, and that contain N and E.

 Possible words: 
   ""SLEET"" -> but L and T are new? But note: does it contain N? No, it doesn't.
   ""STEEN"" -> not common? 
   ""STEIN"" is acceptable? It's a word meaning a beer mug or a musical note.

 Another word: ""SPEND"" -> has S, P, E, N, D.

 How about ""SPINE""? But ""SPINE"" has I and P? Let me list: S, P, I, N, E.

 But note: E is in position 5? Wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5.

 So in ""SPINE"", E is at position 5 -> not allowed? Because the secret word does not have E at position 5? Therefore, we cannot use words with E at the end (position 5).

 In ""STEIN"", E is at position 3 -> good.

 Another option: ""SNIDE"" -> E is at position 5 -> not allowed? So we must avoid E at position 5.

 Therefore, ""STEIN"" seems okay: 
  S, T, E, I, N -> positions 1: S, 2: T, 3: E, 4: I, 5: N.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SETON"" (a word in anatomy) but less common.

 Or ""LINEN"": 
   L, I, N, E, N -> wait, has two Ns? 
   Positions: 
      1: L
      2: I
      3: N -> but we know N cannot be at position 4? What about position 3? Feedback: N was previously in position 4 and was incorrect. But that doesn't say anything about position 3? So position 3 is allowed. 
      4: E -> but E is now in position 4 (was previously not in position 5). Position 4 is allowed? Yes, because E can be anywhere except position 5.
   But note: the secret word contains one N? Or two? We don't know. But ""LINEN"" has two N's? So if the secret word has two N's? But we have only one N reported? The feedback for ""crane"" had one N and it was marked as present. So the secret word has at least one N. But it might have more? However, the feedback doesn't tell us how many, so we cannot assume only one.

 However, in ""LINEN"", we are placing N at position 3 and position 5. The feedback for ""crane"" only told us that the N was present (but in the wrong position). It could be that the secret word has two N's? Or one? We don't know.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us the frequency, so we have to be cautious.

 Another word: ""KNEEL"" -> but E is in position 3 and 4? And N at position 1? 
   Position 1: K -> okay
   Position 2: N -> okay? N was previously in position 4 and wrong. Now we put it at position 2? That is allowed? Yes.
   Positions 3 and 4: E -> but E can be in positions 1-4? So yes.
   However, we have two E's? And one N.

 This is getting complicated.

 Let me stick to words without repeated letters if possible? To avoid complications.

 How about ""INLET""?
   I, N, L, E, T
   Positions:
     1: I
     2: N -> allowed? (since N cannot be at 4, but 2 is fine)
     3: L
     4: E -> E can be at position 4? (since it cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay)
     5: T

 But wait: E is at position 4 -> which is not position 5 -> acceptable.
 However, we must note: the feedback said that N is not at position 4. We are putting N at position 2 -> okay.

 We don't know about I, L, T? They might be in the word? Or not.

 Alternatively, ""BONES"": 
   B, O, N, E, S -> but O? 
   Positions: 
      1: B
      2: O
      3: N -> N in position 3? Previously was in position 4 and incorrect. Position 3 is okay.
      4: E -> E cannot be in position 5? Position 4 is okay? However, we must note: E was in position 5 before? We are putting it in position 4 -> okay.
   But we have E in position 4 -> okay? Yes.

 However, we are using O? We don't know if O is in the word? It might be.

 But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible? 

 Another word: ""SPEND"": 
   S, P, E, N, D
   Positions:
     1: S
     2: P
     3: E -> E not in position 5 -> okay.
     4: N -> Wait! N in position 4? But the feedback said N cannot be in position 4? So this would be invalid? 
        We know the secret word has N, but not at position 4? So if we put N at position 4, then the feedback would mark it as either:
          - Correct? But the word doesn't have it at position 4? No, we are guessing N at position 4? But actually, the feedback might tell us that it's present but wrong? Or absent? 
        Actually, we know the secret word has N but not in position 4? So if we put N at position 4, it would be marked as wrong (probably ""-"" if the word has N elsewhere? or if it has two Ns? it could be marked as correct? But no) -> 
        Actually, if the secret word has N at position 4, then the feedback in the first guess would have been correct? But it wasn't? So the secret word does not have N at position 4? Therefore, we must not use a word that puts N at position 4? Because it's impossible.

 Therefore, we cannot put N at position 4 in any of our guesses? So ""SPEND"" has N at position 4? That is forbidden? So we must avoid position 4 for N.

 Similarly, we must avoid position 5 for E.

 Therefore, ""SPEND"" is invalid? Because we are putting N at position 4? But the secret word does not have N at position 4? So why put it there? We would get a '-' or 'x'? Actually, we want to get more information? But it's a valid guess? But it's known to be wrong? 

 However, the rules do not forbid guessing the same letter in a position we know is wrong? But it's inefficient? We would be wasting a position? 

 So better to avoid known wrong positions? 

 Therefore, let's avoid putting N at position 4 and E at position 5.

 In ""SPEND"", we have E at position 3 and N at position 4? 
   Position 4: N -> we know the secret word does not have N at position 4? So we would get either:
      - If the secret word has N elsewhere and position 4 is not occupied by N? Then the N in our guess would be marked as '-' meaning present but wrong? 
      - But what if the secret word has two N's? And one of them is at position 4? ... Wait, but we know for sure that position 4 is not N? Because the first guess ""crane"" had N at position 4 and it was not correct? So the secret word does not have N at position 4? Even if it has two N's? 

 Therefore, we will get a '-' for N at position 4? Or if the secret word has only one N and it's not at position 4? Then we get '-'. So we will get '-' for N? Which we already know? We don't gain new information? So it's inefficient? We can do better?

 Alternatively, we can try to put N in a new position? To get more information? So let's avoid position 4 for N? And position 5 for E? 

 So going back to ""STEIN"": 
   S at 1? 
   T at 2?
   E at 3 -> okay (E not at 5)
   I at 4 -> we don't know about position 4? 
   N at 5 -> okay? Because N wasn't at position 4? But position 5 is new? And we don't know? 

 However, note: the secret word has N? So placing N at position 5: if it's correct? Then we get a check? Or if it's wrong? We get '-'.

 And we get information about S, T, I.

 Similarly, we can try ""UNSET"" (meaning: not set) -> 
   U, N, S, E, T
   Positions:
     1: U
     2: N -> okay? (N not at position 4? 2 is new)
     3: S
     4: E -> E cannot be at position 5? Position 4 is okay? 
     5: T

 We avoid E at position 5? So E at 4 -> okay? And N at 2 -> okay? 

 But we are introducing U? 

 Another idea: ""MEANY"" -> but has A? No, A is excluded.

 How about ""SETUP"" -> 
   S, E, T, U, P
   But does it have N? No. We must include N? Because it is known to be in the word? 

 So we have to include N? 

 Therefore, we must choose a word that has both N and E? 

 And without C, R, A? 

 Let me consider ""STONE"": 
   S, T, O, N, E -> 
     Positions:
       1: S
       2: T
       3: O
       4: N -> but we cannot put N at position 4! So invalid.

 ""STONE"" has N at position 4 -> forbidden? 

 So we need a word that has N and E? And N not at position 4? E not at position 5? 

 Possibilities:
   N at positions: 1, 2, 3, 5? 
   E at positions: 1, 2, 3, 4?

 I think ""STEIN"" (which is S T E I N) is acceptable: 
   N is at position 5 -> not position 4 -> okay? 
   E is at position 3 -> not position 5? -> okay? 

 Similarly, ""SENT"" with an added letter? ""SENT"" is 4 letters? 

 ""SENTI"" (a word? Not really?) -> let's not.

 How about ""LEMON"": has L, E, M, O, N -> 
   Positions:
     1: L
     2: E -> E allowed at 2? yes
     3: M
     4: O -> ? 
     5: N -> N allowed at 5? yes.

 So E at position 2? and N at position 5? 

 Another: ""MINCE"" -> but has C? C is excluded? So we cannot use C.

 We have to avoid C, R, A.

 ""NOISE"": 
   N, O, I, S, E -> 
   Positions: 
     1: N -> allowed? (N not at position 4? yes)
     2: O
     3: I
     4: S
     5: E -> but E was previously not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? 

 So ""NOISE"" invalid? Because E is at position 5? 

 Therefore, we need to rearrange? How about ""ENVOY""?
   E, N, V, O, Y -> 
   Positions:
     1: E -> allowed? (E can be at 1? yes)
     2: N -> allowed? (N not at 4? yes)
     3: V
     4: O
     5: Y

 This word has E and N? And avoids the forbidden positions? Yes.

 But common? Okay, it's acceptable? 

 However, I want to test as many common letters as possible? 

 Another word: ""BEING"": 
   B, E, I, N, G -> 
   Positions:
     1: B
     2: E -> E at position 2: allowed
     3: I
     4: N -> wait, N at position 4? We know N is not at position 4? So we are putting N at a known forbidden position? 
        That would yield either a '-' (if the secret word has N elsewhere) or 'x' (if we are mistaken about the presence of N? but we know it's present) -> but we are sure N is present? So it would be '-'. But we don't get new position information? Because we already know position 4 is wrong? 

 We should avoid that? So let me avoid position 4 for N.

 Therefore, ""BEING"" has N at position 4? Avoid.

 How about ""BEGUN"": 
   B, E, G, U, N -> 
   Positions:
     1: B
     2: E -> okay
     3: G
     4: U
     5: N -> okay? 
   So E at position 2, N at position 5? 

 Similarly, ""DEIGN"" (meaning: to condescend) -> 
   D, E, I, G, N -> 
   Positions:
     1: D
     2: E -> okay
     3: I
     4: G
     5: N -> okay.

 But note: if we put E and N only in the positions we know they are allowed? But we have many possibilities? 

 I think ""STEIN"" is a good candidate? Because we have common letters S, T, and I? 

 Alternatively, ""DEIGN"" is a bit uncommon? 

 What about ""KEEN""? No, 4 letters? 

 How about ""QUEEN""? It has two E's? 
   Q, U, E, E, N -> 
   But what positions?
     1: Q
     2: U
     3: E -> okay
     4: E -> but wait, we know E is in the word? But how many? We don't know? 
     5: N -> okay.
   We haven't avoided C, R, A? Yes.
   But we know the secret word has at least one E? Could it have two? We don't know? 

 It's acceptable? 

 However, Q is a rare letter? Might not be good? 

 Another word: ""SPINE"": 
   S, P, I, N, E -> 
   Positions:
     1: S
     2: P
     3: I
     4: N -> wait, position 4: N -> we know N is not at position 4? So avoid.

 So ""SPINE"" invalid? 

 How about ""PINED""? 
   P, I, N, E, D -> 
   Positions:
     1: P
     2: I
     3: N -> okay? (N not at 4? now at 3) 
     4: E -> okay? (E not at 5? now at 4)
     5: D
   So N at position 3? Allowed? E at position 4? Allowed? 

 So ""PINED"" seems good? 

 We haven't used any of the excluded letters? 

 But wait, we have E at position 4? Previously we had E at position 5? Now we put at 4? We'll see if that's correct? 

 And N at position 3? Previously at position 4? Now at 3? 

 We'll get information about P, I, D? 

 Alternatively, ""DINED"": 
   D, I, N, E, D -> wait, repeated D? Or ""DINES"": 
   D, I, N, E, S -> 
   Positions:
     1: D
     2: I
     3: N -> okay
     4: E -> okay
     5: S

 I think I'll go with ""STEIN"":

   S, T, E, I, N

   Because it uses common letters? 

   But note: if we get feedback for E at position 3? If E isn't at position 3? Then we know E is elsewhere? 

   Similarly, N at position 5? 

   Also, T and I are new? 

   We are using S? Which was not used before? 

   So let me choose ""STEIN"".

 If I choose ""STEIN"", and the secret word does not have T? Then we'll know.

 We have 6 tries? So we can iterate.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""STEIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- C, R, A are **not** in the secret word.  
- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (N was position 4, E was position 5).  

For the next guess:  
- Must include N and E (since they are in the secret word).  
- N cannot be in position 4 (from feedback).  
- E cannot be in position 5 (from feedback).  
- Avoid C, R, A.  

After evaluating options:  
- ""STEIN"" is chosen (common letters, tests positions effectively).  
  - S, T, E, I, N: New consonants and vowel tested.  
  - E is in position 3 (allowed position).  
  - N is in position 5 (allowed position).

<guess>stein</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""stein"" -> Feedback: S(x) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(-)
Meaning:
- S, T, I are not in the secret word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since ""stein"" is S-T-E-I-N, so E is the third letter).
- N is in the word but not in position 5 (because it's marked as present but wrong position).

So, combining the information:

1. The secret word contains E and N (from both guesses).
2. E is in position 3 (from the second guess: E(✓)).
3. N is in the word but not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). Therefore, N must be in position 1, 2, or 3? But wait, position 3 is already taken by E? So N cannot be in position 3? Therefore, N must be in position 1 or 2.

Let's list the positions:

Position 1: ? (cannot be C, R, A, S, T, I, and also note that N could be here? But we don't know yet)
Position 2: ? (same exclusions, and N could be here)
Position 3: E (fixed, because we have E(✓) in the second guess)
Position 4: ? (cannot be C, R, A, S, T, I, and also note: we know N is not in position 4 from the first guess? But we already have that. Also, from the second guess, we have I(x) at position 4? So position 4 is not I, but we don't know what it is)
Position 5: ? (cannot be C, R, A, S, T, I, and also E is not in position 5? But we know E is in position 3, so position 5 is free. Also, N is not in position 5? So position 5 is not N)

So, to summarize:

- The secret word has E in position 3.
- The secret word has N, but not in positions 4 or 5. And since position 3 is taken by E, N must be in position 1 or 2.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, S, T, I.

Also, we have two letters that are present: E and N. We know E is at position 3, and N is at either 1 or 2.

Now, we need to make a new guess. We should try to determine the position of N and also find the other letters.

We know the word has 5 letters. We know position 3 is E. Position 1 and 2: one of them is N? Or could there be another letter? But we know N is present and must be in 1 or 2.

So the word looks like:

Option A: N _ E _ _
Option B: _ N E _ _

But note: we don't know if there are other letters? We have to fill the rest.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, S, T, I.

We need to choose a word that has E in position 3, and includes N in either position 1 or 2? Actually, we don't have to include N in the guess? But we know N is in the word, so we can use that to our advantage? However, we are trying to find the exact position of N? So we should try to test one of the possibilities.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in position 1 and then other new letters? Or in position 2? 

But note: we have 4 more guesses? So we can try to pin down the position of N.

We can also try to use a word that has N in position 1 and then see the feedback? Or in position 2? 

But we also need to test other letters? 

Let me think of words that have E in position 3 and N in position 1 or 2? 

First, if N is in position 1:

Pattern: N ? E ? ?

We need to fill the second, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not C, R, A, S, T, I.

Similarly, if N is in position 2:

Pattern: ? N E ? ?

We can try to guess a word that fits one of these patterns? 

But we don't know which pattern? So we can choose a word that has N in position 1? Then if we get feedback that N is correct? Then we know it's in position 1? Otherwise, if we get that N is present but wrong? Then it must be in position 2? Because those are the only two possibilities? 

But wait: if we put N in position 1 and it is actually in position 2? Then the feedback for N would be '-' meaning present but wrong? And then we would know N is in position 2? 

Similarly, if we put N in position 2 and it is actually in position 1? Then we get '-' for N? 

But we can also try to cover both possibilities? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have N in position 1 or 2? But that would be inefficient? Because we know N is in the word? So we should use it? 

But if we put N in a position we know it cannot be? For example, if we put N in position 4? We know it's not there? Then we get a '-'? Which we already know? So that's not helpful? 

So we should put N in either position 1 or 2? 

Let me choose to put N in position 1? Then we can test that? 

So pattern: N ? E ? ?

We need to choose the other letters? We want to test as many new letters as possible? 

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C, R, A, S, T, I)

Common letters: L, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

Example words:

- ""N O E L"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5? So ""NOEL"" is 4? 

- ""N I E C E"" -> but I and C are excluded? 

- ""N A K E D"" -> A is excluded? 

- ""N U D G E"" -> 
   N, U, D, G, E -> but E is at position 5? But we need E at position 3? 

We need E at position 3? 

So let me try: 

Position 1: N
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: E (fixed in our pattern? But wait, in the word we are guessing, we are going to put E at position 3? But the secret word has E at position 3? So we can put E at position 3? 

But note: we are going to get a check for E at position 3? So we don't need to worry? 

But we are trying to find the other letters? 

So for the pattern N ? E ? ? 

We can have:

- ""N O E W S"" -> but S is excluded? 

- ""N O E L L"" -> not 5? 

- ""N O E B S"" -> S excluded? 

- ""N O E D"" -> 4 letters? 

- ""N O E V E"" -> E at the end? But we have E at position 3 and 5? 

How about ""NOVEL""? 
   N, O, V, E, L -> 
   Positions: 
      1: N
      2: O
      3: V -> but we need E at position 3? 

We cannot change the E? The secret word has E at position 3? So in our guess, we must put E at position 3? 

So the pattern is: 
   Position 1: N
   Position 2: ? (a new letter)
   Position 3: E (we must put E here? because we know it's correct? and we want to confirm? Actually, we know it's correct? So we can put E at 3? 
   But note: we are going to get a check for E at 3? So we can use that to our advantage? 

But we don't have to? We can put a different letter at 3? But that would be inefficient? Because we know E is at 3? So we should put E at 3? 

Therefore, the guess must have E at position 3? 

So for the pattern: N ? E ? ? 

We need to choose letters for positions 2, 4, and 5? 

Similarly, if we choose the other pattern: ? N E ? ? 

But let's stick to testing N at position 1? 

So: N (position1) + E (position3) 

We need a word: N ? E ? ? 

Examples:

- ""N U E D O"" -> not a word? 

- ""N I E L D"" -> I excluded? 

- ""N A E V E"" -> A excluded? 

- ""N O E L S"" -> S excluded? 

- ""N O E B B"" -> not a word? 

- ""N O E D G"" -> not a word? 

- ""N O E Y D"" -> not a word? 

- ""N O E W D"" -> not a word? 

How about ""N O M E N"" -> 
   N, O, M, E, N -> 
   Positions: 
      1: N
      2: O
      3: M -> but we need E at position 3? 

We cannot put M at position 3? We must put E at position 3? 

So the word must have E at position 3? 

Therefore, the word is: N (1), ? (2), E (3), ? (4), ? (5)

So we need a word that starts with N, has E at the third position? 

Examples:

- ""N I E S T"" -> but I and S and T excluded? 

- ""N U E B A"" -> A excluded? 

- ""N U E L L"" -> not 5? 

- ""N I E V E"" -> I excluded? 

- ""N A E W S"" -> A and S excluded? 

- ""N O E L L"" -> not 5? 

- ""N O E D"" -> 4? 

- ""N O E V E"" -> but then positions: 
   N, O, E, V, E -> 
   Position 1: N
   Position 2: O
   Position 3: E -> good
   Position 4: V
   Position 5: E

But is ""NOVEE"" a word? No? 

How about ""NOEUD""? (a knot? from French) -> 
   N, O, E, U, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: O
      3: E -> good
      4: U
      5: D

But is ""NOEUD"" an English word? It might be accepted? But it's not common? 

Alternatively, ""NUKED"": 
   N, U, K, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: U
      3: K -> but we need E at 3? 

We cannot put K at 3? We must put E at 3? 

So we need the third letter to be E? 

Another word: ""NEVER"": 
   N, E, V, E, R -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: E -> but we are trying to put E at 3? 
   But we can shift? 
   But we need E at 3? 

How about ""NEEDS"": 
   N, E, E, D, S -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: E
      3: E -> but we are putting E at 3? 
   But S is excluded? 

And also, we have two E's? 

But the secret word has at least one E? But we don't know about two? 

But S is excluded? 

So not valid? 

Another idea: ""NEXUS"": 
   N, E, X, U, S -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: E
      3: X -> but we need E at 3? 

We cannot? 

We need a word that has the third letter as E? 

Let me search for words that start with N and have E as the third letter? 

Examples: 
   ""N A E V E"" -> not valid? 
   ""N I E L D"" -> I excluded? 
   ""N O E L"" -> 4 letters? 
   ""N U E L"" -> 4? 
   ""N I E V E"" -> I excluded? 
   ""N O E D"" -> 4? 
   ""N O E S"" -> 4? 

How about ""NOMEN""? (as in nomen? meaning a name in Latin) -> 
   N, O, M, E, N -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: O
      3: M -> not E? 

We need the third letter to be E? 

Another: ""NUDGE"": 
   N, U, D, G, E -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: U
      3: D -> not E? 

We are stuck? 

Perhaps we should consider the other pattern: with N in position 2? 

Pattern: ? N E ? ? 

So the word has: 
   Position 1: ? 
   Position 2: N
   Position 3: E
   Position 4: ?
   Position 5: ?

And we know the secret word has E at position 3? 

So we can guess a word with N at position 2 and E at position 3? 

Examples:

- ""U N E D O"" -> not a word? 

- ""B N E E D"" -> not? 

- ""D N E E D"" -> not? 

- ""L N E D S"" -> not? 

- ""M N E W S"" -> not? 

- ""P N E U M"" -> not 5? 

- ""U N E A R"" -> R excluded? 

- ""U N E D G"" -> not a word? 

- ""U N I T E"" -> but I excluded? 

- ""U N T E N"" -> T excluded? 

- ""U N D E E"" -> not? 

- ""U N D E R"" -> R excluded? 

- ""U N L E S"" -> S excluded? 

- ""U N M E T"" -> T excluded? 

- ""U N Z I P"" -> I excluded? 

- ""B O N E D"" -> 
   B, O, N, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: B
      2: O -> but we need N at position 2? 

We need N at position 2? 

So the word must have N at position 2 and E at position 3? 

Examples:

- ""B N E E P"" -> not a word? 

- ""C N E W S"" -> C excluded? 

- ""D N E E D"" -> not? 

- ""F N E S T"" -> S and T excluded? 

- ""G N E W S"" -> S excluded? 

- ""H N E S S"" -> S excluded? 

- ""K N E E D"" -> 
   K, N, E, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: K
      2: N -> good
      3: E -> good
      4: E
      5: D

But is ""KNEED"" a word? Yes, meaning having knees or to knee? 

And it has E at position 3? 

Also, we are using K, N, E, E, D? 

We avoid C, R, A, S, T, I? 

So ""KNEED"" is a valid guess? 

But note: we have two E's? 

The secret word has at least one E? But we don't know about two? 

Also, we are putting N at position 2? If the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get a check? If not? Then we get '-' and we know N is at position 1? 

But in this guess, we are also testing K and D? 

Another word: ""KNELT"": 
   K, N, E, L, T -> 
   But T is excluded? 

So not valid? 

Another: ""KNEAD"": 
   K, N, E, A, D -> 
   But A is excluded? 

So not valid? 

Another: ""GNOME"": 
   G, N, O, M, E -> 
   Positions:
      1: G
      2: N -> good
      3: O -> but we need E at position 3? 

We cannot? 

So ""KNEED"" seems like a possibility? 

But let me check if there are other words? 

""ONERY"" (variant of ornery) -> 
   O, N, E, R, Y -> 
   But R is excluded? 

""INEPT"": I excluded? 

""UNETH"": not common? 

""JNEOU"": not a word? 

So ""KNEED"" might be acceptable? 

But we have to consider: if we put N at position 2? And if the secret word has N at position 1? Then we will get feedback for N at position 2 as '-'? And we will know N is at position 1? 

Similarly, if N is at position 2? Then we get a check? 

Also, we are testing K at position 1 and D at position 5? 

But note: the secret word has E at position 3? So we are not testing that? 

Another word: ""DWINE"" (archaic for waste away) -> 
   D, W, I, N, E -> 
   But I is excluded? 

""OWLED"": 
   O, W, L, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: O
      2: W
      3: L -> not E? 

We need E at position 3? 

So I think ""KNEED"" is a candidate? 

But let me think of a more common word? 

How about ""QUEEN""? 
   Q, U, E, E, N -> 
   Positions:
      1: Q
      2: U
      3: E -> good
      4: E
      5: N

But we are not putting N at position 2? We are putting it at position 5? But we know N is not at position 5? So we would be putting N at a position we know it's not? 

So feedback for N at position 5 would be '-'? Which we already know? So it's inefficient? 

We should avoid that? 

Therefore, ""KNEED"" is better? 

Another word: ""BLEED"": 
   B, L, E, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: B
      2: L
      3: E -> good
      4: E
      5: D

But we are not testing N? We know N is in the word? But we are not including N in the guess? That's allowed? But we won't get information about N? 

We know N is in the word? So if we don't include N? Then we get no feedback on N? And we still don't know if it's at position 1 or 2? 

So that's not good? We should include N? 

Therefore, we must include N in the guess? 

So ""KNEED"" includes N at position 2? 

Another word: ""NEEDY"": 
   N, E, E, D, Y -> 
   Positions:
      1: N
      2: E -> but we need E at position 3? 
   So not? 

""ENDED"": 
   E, N, D, E, D -> 
   Positions:
      1: E -> but we are not sure if E can be at 1? But we know E is at 3? So we cannot put E at 1? 
   And also, we are not putting E at 3? 

So not? 

I think ""KNEED"" is a good choice? 

But let's confirm the letters: K, N, E, E, D

We avoid C, R, A, S, T, I? Yes.

So I'll go with ""KNEED"".

But note: we are putting two E's? The secret word might have only one E? But we don't know? 

If the secret word has only one E, then the E at position 4 would be marked as 'x'? Or '-'? 

Since we have E at position 3 which is correct? And at position 4? If the secret word has only one E? Then the E at position 4 would be marked as 'x'? 

But we know the secret word has at least one E? 

Similarly, for N: we are putting N at position 2? 

So feedback will tell us if N is at position 2 or not? 

Therefore, I choose ""KNEED"".

<guess>kneed</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  
  - **C, R, A** are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - **N** is present but **not in position 4**.  
  - **E** is present but **not in position 5**.  

- **Guess 2: ""stein""** → S(x), T(x), E(✓), I(x), N(-)  
  - **S, T, I** are **absent** from the secret word.  
  - **E** is **correct and in position 3** (confirmed).  
  - **N** is present but **not in position 5**.  

### Key Insights
1. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - **E** is fixed in **position 3** (from ""stein"" feedback).  
   - **N** is present but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from both guesses). Since position 3 is occupied by E, **N must be in position 1 or 2**.  
   
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T, I.  
   - Remaining letters to use: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

3. **Word structure**:  
   - Position 3 is **E** (fixed).  
   - Positions 1 and 2: One of them is **N** (the other is unknown).  
   - Positions 4 and 5: Unknown letters (not N, E, or absent letters).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Test the position of N**: Since N must be in position 1 or 2, prioritize a word that places N in one of these positions to resolve its location.  
- **Maximize new letter coverage**: Use common letters (e.g., K, D, O) to test for presence/absence.  
- **Avoid inefficiency**: Do not reuse known absent letters or place N/E in forbidden positions (e.g., N not in 4/5, E not in 5).  

### Chosen Guess: ""KNEED""
- **Structure**: K N E E D  
  - **Position 1**: K (tests a new letter).  
  - **Position 2**: N (tests if N is in position 2; if not, it must be in position 1).  
  - **Position 3**: E (fixed, will confirm as correct).  
  - **Position 4**: E (tests if there is a second E; if absent, marked ""x"").  
  - **Position 5**: D (tests a new letter).  

- **Why ""KNEED""?**  
  - Efficiently tests N's position (1 or 2) while covering new letters (K, D).  
  - Complies with constraints: no C, R, A, S, T, I; E in position 3; N not in 4/5.  
  - Common word (meaning: to strike with the knee).  

### Expected Outcomes
- If N is in position 2: Feedback will show N(✓).  
- If N is in position 1: Feedback will show N(-) (since it's misplaced in position 2).  
- Feedback for K, D, and the second E will provide new information for subsequent guesses.

Actually, N could be in any position except 4, and E in any position except 5.\n\n But note: the feedback for N was ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. Similarly for E.\n\n Since we have two letters that must be included: N and E.\n\n We can try to pick a word that has N and E, and then other common letters.\n\n Example: ""LENIS"" (meaning: a musical term) but let\'s think of more common words.\n\n Alternatively: ""STEIN"" -> S T E I N.\n\n Let me check: \n   Position 1: S -> might be okay? \n   Position 2: T\n   Position 3: E -> note that E was in the wrong position? It was previously in position 5, now we put it in position 3 -> that\'s allowed.\n   Position 4: I\n   Position 5: N -> but wait: N was in position 4 in the first guess and was wrong. Now we put it in position 5 -> that is allowed? The feedback said N is in the word but not at position 4. Position 5 is different, so it could be.\n\n However, note that E cannot be in position 5? Actually, the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Similarly, N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n So in ""STEIN"": \n   E is in position 3 -> allowed.\n   N is in position 5 -> allowed.\n\n But we don\'t know if S, T, I are in the word? We haven\'t ruled them out.\n\n We must avoid using C, R, A.\n\n Another idea: since the word must have N and E, let\'s try ""MEAN"" but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\n Example 5-letter words: ""MEANT"" -> wait, but it has A? A is not allowed because we know A is not in the secret word.\n\n Similarly, ""MEANS"" -> has A again? No, ""MEANS"" has M, E, A, N, S -> A is present which we know is absent. So we cannot use A.\n\n Let me try to think of words without C, R, A, and that contain N and E.\n\n Possible words: \n   ""SLEET"" -> but L and T are new? But note: does it contain N? No, it doesn\'t.\n   ""STEEN"" -> not common? \n   ""STEIN"" is acceptable? It\'s a word meaning a beer mug or a musical note.\n\n Another word: ""SPEND"" -> has S, P, E, N, D.\n\n How about ""SPINE""? But ""SPINE"" has I and P? Let me list: S, P, I, N, E.\n\n But note: E is in position 5? Wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5.\n\n So in ""SPINE"", E is at position 5 -> not allowed? Because the secret word does not have E at position 5? Therefore, we cannot use words with E at the end (position 5).\n\n In ""STEIN"", E is at position 3 -> good.\n\n Another option: ""SNIDE"" -> E is at position 5 -> not allowed? So we must avoid E at position 5.\n\n Therefore, ""STEIN"" seems okay: \n  S, T, E, I, N -> positions 1: S, 2: T, 3: E, 4: I, 5: N.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SETON"" (a word in anatomy) but less common.\n\n Or ""LINEN"": \n   L, I, N, E, N -> wait, has two Ns? \n   Positions: \n      1: L\n      2: I\n      3: N -> but we know N cannot be at position 4? What about position 3? Feedback: N was previously in position 4 and was incorrect. But that doesn\'t say anything about position 3? So position 3 is allowed. \n      4: E -> but E is now in position 4 (was previously not in position 5). Position 4 is allowed? Yes, because E can be anywhere except position 5.\n   But note: the secret word contains one N? Or two? We don\'t know. But ""LINEN"" has two N\'s? So if the secret word has two N\'s? But we have only one N reported? The feedback for ""crane"" had one N and it was marked as present. So the secret word has at least one N. But it might have more? However, the feedback doesn\'t tell us how many, so we cannot assume only one.\n\n However, in ""LINEN"", we are placing N at position 3 and position 5. The feedback for ""crane"" only told us that the N was present (but in the wrong position). It could be that the secret word has two N\'s? Or one? We don\'t know.\n\n But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us the frequency, so we have to be cautious.\n\n Another word: ""KNEEL"" -> but E is in position 3 and 4? And N at position 1? \n   Position 1: K -> okay\n   Position 2: N -> okay? N was previously in position 4 and wrong. Now we put it at position 2? That is allowed? Yes.\n   Positions 3 and 4: E -> but E can be in positions 1-4? So yes.\n   However, we have two E\'s? And one N.\n\n This is getting complicated.\n\n Let me stick to words without repeated letters if possible? To avoid complications.\n\n How about ""INLET""?\n   I, N, L, E, T\n   Positions:\n     1: I\n     2: N -> allowed? (since N cannot be at 4, but 2 is fine)\n     3: L\n     4: E -> E can be at position 4? (since it cannot be at 5, but 4 is okay)\n     5: T\n\n But wait: E is at position 4 -> which is not position 5 -> acceptable.\n However, we must note: the feedback said that N is not at position 4. We are putting N at position 2 -> okay.\n\n We don\'t know about I, L, T? They might be in the word? Or not.\n\n Alternatively, ""BONES"": \n   B, O, N, E, S -> but O? \n   Positions: \n      1: B\n      2: O\n      3: N -> N in position 3? Previously was in position 4 and incorrect. Position 3 is okay.\n      4: E -> E cannot be in position 5? Position 4 is okay? However, we must note: E was in position 5 before? We are putting it in position 4 -> okay.\n   But we have E in position 4 -> okay? Yes.\n\n However, we are using O? We don\'t know if O is in the word? It might be.\n\n But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible? \n\n Another word: ""SPEND"": \n   S, P, E, N, D\n   Positions:\n     1: S\n     2: P\n     3: E -> E not in position 5 -> okay.\n     4: N -> Wait! N in position 4? But the feedback said N cannot be in position 4? So this would be invalid? \n        We know the secret word has N, but not at position 4? So if we put N at position 4, then the feedback would mark it as either:\n          - Correct? But the word doesn\'t have it at position 4? No, we are guessing N at position 4? But actually, the feedback might tell us that it\'s present but wrong? Or absent? \n        Actually, we know the secret word has N but not in position 4? So if we put N at position 4, it would be marked as wrong (probably ""-"" if the word has N elsewhere? or if it has two Ns? it could be marked as correct? But no) -> \n        Actually, if the secret word has N at position 4, then the feedback in the first guess would have been correct? But it wasn\'t? So the secret word does not have N at position 4? Therefore, we must not use a word that puts N at position 4? Because it\'s impossible.\n\n Therefore, we cannot put N at position 4 in any of our guesses? So ""SPEND"" has N at position 4? That is forbidden? So we must avoid position 4 for N.\n\n Similarly, we must avoid position 5 for E.\n\n Therefore, ""SPEND"" is invalid? Because we are putting N at position 4? But the secret word does not have N at position 4? So why put it there? We would get a \'-\' or \'x\'? Actually, we want to get more information? But it\'s a valid guess? But it\'s known to be wrong? \n\n However, the rules do not forbid guessing the same letter in a position we know is wrong? But it\'s inefficient? We would be wasting a position? \n\n So better to avoid known wrong positions? \n\n Therefore, let\'s avoid putting N at position 4 and E at position 5.\n\n In ""SPEND"", we have E at position 3 and N at position 4? \n   Position 4: N -> we know the secret word does not have N at position 4? So we would get either:\n      - If the secret word has N elsewhere and position 4 is not occupied by N? Then the N in our guess would be marked as \'-\' meaning present but wrong? \n      - But what if the secret word has two N\'s? And one of them is at position 4? ... Wait, but we know for sure that position 4 is not N? Because the first guess ""crane"" had N at position 4 and it was not correct? So the secret word does not have N at position 4? Even if it has two N\'s? \n\n Therefore, we will get a \'-\' for N at position 4? Or if the secret word has only one N and it\'s not at position 4? Then we get \'-\'. So we will get \'-\' for N? Which we already know? We don\'t gain new information? So it\'s inefficient? We can do better?\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put N in a new position? To get more information? So let\'s avoid position 4 for N? And position 5 for E? \n\n So going back to ""STEIN"": \n   S at 1? \n   T at 2?\n   E at 3 -> okay (E not at 5)\n   I at 4 -> we don\'t know about position 4? \n   N at 5 -> okay? Because N wasn\'t at position 4? But position 5 is new? And we don\'t know? \n\n However, note: the secret word has N? So placing N at position 5: if it\'s correct? Then we get a check? Or if it\'s wrong? We get \'-\'.\n\n And we get information about S, T, I.\n\n Similarly, we can try ""UNSET"" (meaning: not set) -> \n   U, N, S, E, T\n   Positions:\n     1: U\n     2: N -> okay? (N not at position 4? 2 is new)\n     3: S\n     4: E -> E cannot be at position 5? Position 4 is okay? \n     5: T\n\n We avoid E at position 5? So E at 4 -> okay? And N at 2 -> okay? \n\n But we are introducing U? \n\n Another idea: ""MEANY"" -> but has A? No, A is excluded.\n\n How about ""SETUP"" -> \n   S, E, T, U, P\n   But does it have N? No. We must include N? Because it is known to be in the word? \n\n So we have to include N? \n\n Therefore, we must choose a word that has both N and E? \n\n And without C, R, A? \n\n Let me consider ""STONE"": \n   S, T, O, N, E -> \n     Positions:\n       1: S\n       2: T\n       3: O\n       4: N -> but we cannot put N at position 4! So invalid.\n\n ""STONE"" has N at position 4 -> forbidden? \n\n So we need a word that has N and E? And N not at position 4? E not at position 5? \n\n Possibilities:\n   N at positions: 1, 2, 3, 5? \n   E at positions: 1, 2, 3, 4?\n\n I think ""STEIN"" (which is S T E I N) is acceptable: \n   N is at position 5 -> not position 4 -> okay? \n   E is at position 3 -> not position 5? -> okay? \n\n Similarly, ""SENT"" with an added letter? ""SENT"" is 4 letters? \n\n ""SENTI"" (a word? Not really?) -> let\'s not.\n\n How about ""LEMON"": has L, E, M, O, N -> \n   Positions:\n     1: L\n     2: E -> E allowed at 2? yes\n     3: M\n     4: O -> ? \n     5: N -> N allowed at 5? yes.\n\n So E at position 2? and N at position 5? \n\n Another: ""MINCE"" -> but has C? C is excluded? So we cannot use C.\n\n We have to avoid C, R, A.\n\n ""NOISE"": \n   N, O, I, S, E -> \n   Positions: \n     1: N -> allowed? (N not at position 4? yes)\n     2: O\n     3: I\n     4: S\n     5: E -> but E was previously not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5? \n\n So ""NOISE"" invalid? Because E is at position 5? \n\n Therefore, we need to rearrange? How about ""ENVOY""?\n   E, N, V, O, Y -> \n   Positions:\n     1: E -> allowed? (E can be at 1? yes)\n     2: N -> allowed? (N not at 4? yes)\n     3: V\n     4: O\n     5: Y\n\n This word has E and N? And avoids the forbidden positions? Yes.\n\n But common? Okay, it\'s acceptable? \n\n However, I want to test as many common letters as possible? \n\n Another word: ""BEING"": \n   B, E, I, N, G -> \n   Positions:\n     1: B\n     2: E -> E at position 2: allowed\n     3: I\n     4: N -> wait, N at position 4? We know N is not at position 4? So we are putting N at a known forbidden position? \n        That would yield either a \'-\' (if the secret word has N elsewhere) or \'x\' (if we are mistaken about the presence of N? but we know it\'s present) -> but we are sure N is present? So it would be \'-\'. But we don\'t get new position information? Because we already know position 4 is wrong? \n\n We should avoid that? So let me avoid position 4 for N.\n\n Therefore, ""BEING"" has N at position 4? Avoid.\n\n How about ""BEGUN"": \n   B, E, G, U, N -> \n   Positions:\n     1: B\n     2: E -> okay\n     3: G\n     4: U\n     5: N -> okay? \n   So E at position 2, N at position 5? \n\n Similarly, ""DEIGN"" (meaning: to condescend) -> \n   D, E, I, G, N -> \n   Positions:\n     1: D\n     2: E -> okay\n     3: I\n     4: G\n     5: N -> okay.\n\n But note: if we put E and N only in the positions we know they are allowed? But we have many possibilities? \n\n I think ""STEIN"" is a good candidate? Because we have common letters S, T, and I? \n\n Alternatively, ""DEIGN"" is a bit uncommon? \n\n What about ""KEEN""? No, 4 letters? \n\n How about ""QUEEN""? It has two E\'s? \n   Q, U, E, E, N -> \n   But what positions?\n     1: Q\n     2: U\n     3: E -> okay\n     4: E -> but wait, we know E is in the word? But how many? We don\'t know? \n     5: N -> okay.\n   We haven\'t avoided C, R, A? Yes.\n   But we know the secret word has at least one E? Could it have two? We don\'t know? \n\n It\'s acceptable? \n\n However, Q is a rare letter? Might not be good? \n\n Another word: ""SPINE"": \n   S, P, I, N, E -> \n   Positions:\n     1: S\n     2: P\n     3: I\n     4: N -> wait, position 4: N -> we know N is not at position 4? So avoid.\n\n So ""SPINE"" invalid? \n\n How about ""PINED""? \n   P, I, N, E, D -> \n   Positions:\n     1: P\n     2: I\n     3: N -> okay? (N not at 4? now at 3) \n     4: E -> okay? (E not at 5? now at 4)\n     5: D\n   So N at position 3? Allowed? E at position 4? Allowed? \n\n So ""PINED"" seems good? \n\n We haven\'t used any of the excluded letters? \n\n But wait, we have E at position 4? Previously we had E at position 5? Now we put at 4? We\'ll see if that\'s correct? \n\n And N at position 3? Previously at position 4? Now at 3? \n\n We\'ll get information about P, I, D? \n\n Alternatively, ""DINED"": \n   D, I, N, E, D -> wait, repeated D? Or ""DINES"": \n   D, I, N, E, S -> \n   Positions:\n     1: D\n     2: I\n     3: N -> okay\n     4: E -> okay\n     5: S\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""STEIN"":\n\n   S, T, E, I, N\n\n   Because it uses common letters? \n\n   But note: if we get feedback for E at position 3? If E isn\'t at position 3? Then we know E is elsewhere? \n\n   Similarly, N at position 5? \n\n   Also, T and I are new? \n\n   We are using S? Which was not used before? \n\n   So let me choose ""STEIN"".\n\n If I choose ""STEIN"", and the secret word does not have T? Then we\'ll know.\n\n We have 6 tries? So we can iterate.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll go with ""STEIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- C, R, A are **not** in the secret word.  \n- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (N was position 4, E was position 5).  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Must include N and E (since they are in the secret word).  \n- N cannot be in position 4 (from feedback).  \n- E cannot be in position 5 (from feedback).  \n- Avoid C, R, A.  \n\nAfter evaluating options:  \n- ""STEIN"" is chosen (common letters, tests positions effectively).  \n  - S, T, E, I, N: New consonants and vowel tested.  \n  - E is in position 3 (allowed position).  \n  - N is in position 5 (allowed position).\n\n<guess>stein</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A are not in the secret word.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""stein"" -> Feedback: S(x) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(-)\nMeaning:\n- S, T, I are not in the secret word.\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, since ""stein"" is S-T-E-I-N, so E is the third letter).\n- N is in the word but not in position 5 (because it\'s marked as present but wrong position).\n\nSo, combining the information:\n\n1. The secret word contains E and N (from both guesses).\n2. E is in position 3 (from the second guess: E(✓)).\n3. N is in the word but not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). Therefore, N must be in position 1, 2, or 3? But wait, position 3 is already taken by E? So N cannot be in position 3? Therefore, N must be in position 1 or 2.\n\nLet\'s list the positions:\n\nPosition 1: ? (cannot be C, R, A, S, T, I, and also note that N could be here? But we don\'t know yet)\nPosition 2: ? (same exclusions, and N could be here)\nPosition 3: E (fixed, because we have E(✓) in the second guess)\nPosition 4: ? (cannot be C, R, A, S, T, I, and also note: we know N is not in position 4 from the first guess? But we already have that. Also, from the second guess, we have I(x) at position 4? So position 4 is not I, but we don\'t know what it is)\nPosition 5: ? (cannot be C, R, A, S, T, I, and also E is not in position 5? But we know E is in position 3, so position 5 is free. Also, N is not in position 5? So position 5 is not N)\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- The secret word has E in position 3.\n- The secret word has N, but not in positions 4 or 5. And since position 3 is taken by E, N must be in position 1 or 2.\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, S, T, I.\n\nAlso, we have two letters that are present: E and N. We know E is at position 3, and N is at either 1 or 2.\n\nNow, we need to make a new guess. We should try to determine the position of N and also find the other letters.\n\nWe know the word has 5 letters. We know position 3 is E. Position 1 and 2: one of them is N? Or could there be another letter? But we know N is present and must be in 1 or 2.\n\nSo the word looks like:\n\nOption A: N _ E _ _\nOption B: _ N E _ _\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if there are other letters? We have to fill the rest.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, S, T, I.\n\nWe need to choose a word that has E in position 3, and includes N in either position 1 or 2? Actually, we don\'t have to include N in the guess? But we know N is in the word, so we can use that to our advantage? However, we are trying to find the exact position of N? So we should try to test one of the possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has N in position 1 and then other new letters? Or in position 2? \n\nBut note: we have 4 more guesses? So we can try to pin down the position of N.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has N in position 1 and then see the feedback? Or in position 2? \n\nBut we also need to test other letters? \n\nLet me think of words that have E in position 3 and N in position 1 or 2? \n\nFirst, if N is in position 1:\n\nPattern: N ? E ? ?\n\nWe need to fill the second, fourth, and fifth positions with letters that are not C, R, A, S, T, I.\n\nSimilarly, if N is in position 2:\n\nPattern: ? N E ? ?\n\nWe can try to guess a word that fits one of these patterns? \n\nBut we don\'t know which pattern? So we can choose a word that has N in position 1? Then if we get feedback that N is correct? Then we know it\'s in position 1? Otherwise, if we get that N is present but wrong? Then it must be in position 2? Because those are the only two possibilities? \n\nBut wait: if we put N in position 1 and it is actually in position 2? Then the feedback for N would be \'-\' meaning present but wrong? And then we would know N is in position 2? \n\nSimilarly, if we put N in position 2 and it is actually in position 1? Then we get \'-\' for N? \n\nBut we can also try to cover both possibilities? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have N in position 1 or 2? But that would be inefficient? Because we know N is in the word? So we should use it? \n\nBut if we put N in a position we know it cannot be? For example, if we put N in position 4? We know it\'s not there? Then we get a \'-\'? Which we already know? So that\'s not helpful? \n\nSo we should put N in either position 1 or 2? \n\nLet me choose to put N in position 1? Then we can test that? \n\nSo pattern: N ? E ? ?\n\nWe need to choose the other letters? We want to test as many new letters as possible? \n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C, R, A, S, T, I)\n\nCommon letters: L, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nExample words:\n\n- ""N O E L"" -> but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5? So ""NOEL"" is 4? \n\n- ""N I E C E"" -> but I and C are excluded? \n\n- ""N A K E D"" -> A is excluded? \n\n- ""N U D G E"" -> \n   N, U, D, G, E -> but E is at position 5? But we need E at position 3? \n\nWe need E at position 3? \n\nSo let me try: \n\nPosition 1: N\nPosition 2: ? \nPosition 3: E (fixed in our pattern? But wait, in the word we are guessing, we are going to put E at position 3? But the secret word has E at position 3? So we can put E at position 3? \n\nBut note: we are going to get a check for E at position 3? So we don\'t need to worry? \n\nBut we are trying to find the other letters? \n\nSo for the pattern N ? E ? ? \n\nWe can have:\n\n- ""N O E W S"" -> but S is excluded? \n\n- ""N O E L L"" -> not 5? \n\n- ""N O E B S"" -> S excluded? \n\n- ""N O E D"" -> 4 letters? \n\n- ""N O E V E"" -> E at the end? But we have E at position 3 and 5? \n\nHow about ""NOVEL""? \n   N, O, V, E, L -> \n   Positions: \n      1: N\n      2: O\n      3: V -> but we need E at position 3? \n\nWe cannot change the E? The secret word has E at position 3? So in our guess, we must put E at position 3? \n\nSo the pattern is: \n   Position 1: N\n   Position 2: ? (a new letter)\n   Position 3: E (we must put E here? because we know it\'s correct? and we want to confirm? Actually, we know it\'s correct? So we can put E at 3? \n   But note: we are going to get a check for E at 3? So we can use that to our advantage? \n\nBut we don\'t have to? We can put a different letter at 3? But that would be inefficient? Because we know E is at 3? So we should put E at 3? \n\nTherefore, the guess must have E at position 3? \n\nSo for the pattern: N ? E ? ? \n\nWe need to choose letters for positions 2, 4, and 5? \n\nSimilarly, if we choose the other pattern: ? N E ? ? \n\nBut let\'s stick to testing N at position 1? \n\nSo: N (position1) + E (position3) \n\nWe need a word: N ? E ? ? \n\nExamples:\n\n- ""N U E D O"" -> not a word? \n\n- ""N I E L D"" -> I excluded? \n\n- ""N A E V E"" -> A excluded? \n\n- ""N O E L S"" -> S excluded? \n\n- ""N O E B B"" -> not a word? \n\n- ""N O E D G"" -> not a word? \n\n- ""N O E Y D"" -> not a word? \n\n- ""N O E W D"" -> not a word? \n\nHow about ""N O M E N"" -> \n   N, O, M, E, N -> \n   Positions: \n      1: N\n      2: O\n      3: M -> but we need E at position 3? \n\nWe cannot put M at position 3? We must put E at position 3? \n\nSo the word must have E at position 3? \n\nTherefore, the word is: N (1), ? (2), E (3), ? (4), ? (5)\n\nSo we need a word that starts with N, has E at the third position? \n\nExamples:\n\n- ""N I E S T"" -> but I and S and T excluded? \n\n- ""N U E B A"" -> A excluded? \n\n- ""N U E L L"" -> not 5? \n\n- ""N I E V E"" -> I excluded? \n\n- ""N A E W S"" -> A and S excluded? \n\n- ""N O E L L"" -> not 5? \n\n- ""N O E D"" -> 4? \n\n- ""N O E V E"" -> but then positions: \n   N, O, E, V, E -> \n   Position 1: N\n   Position 2: O\n   Position 3: E -> good\n   Position 4: V\n   Position 5: E\n\nBut is ""NOVEE"" a word? No? \n\nHow about ""NOEUD""? (a knot? from French) -> \n   N, O, E, U, D -> \n   Positions:\n      1: N\n      2: O\n      3: E -> good\n      4: U\n      5: D\n\nBut is ""NOEUD"" an English word? It might be accepted? But it\'s not common? \n\nAlternatively, ""NUKED"": \n   N, U, K, E, D -> \n   Positions:\n      1: N\n      2: U\n      3: K -> but we need E at 3? \n\nWe cannot put K at 3? We must put E at 3? \n\nSo we need the third letter to be E? \n\nAnother word: ""NEVER"": \n   N, E, V, E, R -> \n   Positions:\n      1: N\n      2: E -> but we are trying to put E at 3? \n   But we can shift? \n   But we need E at 3? \n\nHow about ""NEEDS"": \n   N, E, E, D, S -> \n   Positions:\n      1: N\n      2: E\n      3: E -> but we are putting E at 3? \n   But S is excluded? \n\nAnd also, we have two E\'s? \n\nBut the secret word has at least one E? But we don\'t know about two? \n\nBut S is excluded? \n\nSo not valid? \n\nAnother idea: ""NEXUS"": \n   N, E, X, U, S -> \n   Positions:\n      1: N\n      2: E\n      3: X -> but we need E at 3? \n\nWe cannot? \n\nWe need a word that has the third letter as E? \n\nLet me search for words that start with N and have E as the third letter? \n\nExamples: \n   ""N A E V E"" -> not valid? \n   ""N I E L D"" -> I excluded? \n   ""N O E L"" -> 4 letters? \n   ""N U E L"" -> 4? \n   ""N I E V E"" -> I excluded? \n   ""N O E D"" -> 4? \n   ""N O E S"" -> 4? \n\nHow about ""NOMEN""? (as in nomen? meaning a name in Latin) -> \n   N, O, M, E, N -> \n   Positions:\n      1: N\n      2: O\n      3: M -> not E? \n\nWe need the third letter to be E? \n\nAnother: ""NUDGE"": \n   N, U, D, G, E -> \n   Positions:\n      1: N\n      2: U\n      3: D -> not E? \n\nWe are stuck? \n\nPerhaps we should consider the other pattern: with N in position 2? \n\nPattern: ? N E ? ? \n\nSo the word has: \n   Position 1: ? \n   Position 2: N\n   Position 3: E\n   Position 4: ?\n   Position 5: ?\n\nAnd we know the secret word has E at position 3? \n\nSo we can guess a word with N at position 2 and E at position 3? \n\nExamples:\n\n- ""U N E D O"" -> not a word? \n\n- ""B N E E D"" -> not? \n\n- ""D N E E D"" -> not? \n\n- ""L N E D S"" -> not? \n\n- ""M N E W S"" -> not? \n\n- ""P N E U M"" -> not 5? \n\n- ""U N E A R"" -> R excluded? \n\n- ""U N E D G"" -> not a word? \n\n- ""U N I T E"" -> but I excluded? \n\n- ""U N T E N"" -> T excluded? \n\n- ""U N D E E"" -> not? \n\n- ""U N D E R"" -> R excluded? \n\n- ""U N L E S"" -> S excluded? \n\n- ""U N M E T"" -> T excluded? \n\n- ""U N Z I P"" -> I excluded? \n\n- ""B O N E D"" -> \n   B, O, N, E, D -> \n   Positions:\n      1: B\n      2: O -> but we need N at position 2? \n\nWe need N at position 2? \n\nSo the word must have N at position 2 and E at position 3? \n\nExamples:\n\n- ""B N E E P"" -> not a word? \n\n- ""C N E W S"" -> C excluded? \n\n- ""D N E E D"" -> not? \n\n- ""F N E S T"" -> S and T excluded? \n\n- ""G N E W S"" -> S excluded? \n\n- ""H N E S S"" -> S excluded? \n\n- ""K N E E D"" -> \n   K, N, E, E, D -> \n   Positions:\n      1: K\n      2: N -> good\n      3: E -> good\n      4: E\n      5: D\n\nBut is ""KNEED"" a word? Yes, meaning having knees or to knee? \n\nAnd it has E at position 3? \n\nAlso, we are using K, N, E, E, D? \n\nWe avoid C, R, A, S, T, I? \n\nSo ""KNEED"" is a valid guess? \n\nBut note: we have two E\'s? \n\nThe secret word has at least one E?

So it\'s inefficient? \n\nWe should avoid that? \n\nTherefore, ""KNEED"" is better? \n\nAnother word: ""BLEED"": \n   B, L, E, E, D -> \n   Positions:\n      1: B\n      2: L\n      3: E -> good\n      4: E\n      5: D\n\nBut we are not testing N? We know N is in the word? But we are not including N in the guess? That\'s allowed? But we won\'t get information about N? \n\nWe know N is in the word? So if we don\'t include N? Then we get no feedback on N? And we still don\'t know if it\'s at position 1 or 2? \n\nSo that\'s not good? We should include N? \n\nTherefore, we must include N in the guess? \n\nSo ""KNEED"" includes N at position 2? \n\nAnother word: ""NEEDY"": \n   N, E, E, D, Y -> \n   Positions:\n      1: N\n      2: E -> but we need E at position 3? \n   So not? \n\n""ENDED"": \n   E, N, D, E, D -> \n   Positions:\n      1: E -> but we are not sure if E can be at 1? But we know E is at 3? So we cannot put E at 1? \n   And also, we are not putting E at 3? \n\nSo not? \n\nI think ""KNEED"" is a good choice? \n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: K, N, E, E, D\n\nWe avoid C, R, A, S, T, I? Yes.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""KNEED"".\n\nBut note: we are putting two E\'s? The secret word might have only one E? But we don\'t know? \n\nIf the secret word has only one E, then the E at position 4 would be marked as \'x\'? Or \'-\'? \n\nSince we have E at position 3 which is correct? And at position 4? If the secret word has only one E? Then the E at position 4 would be marked as \'x\'? \n\nBut we know the secret word has at least one E? \n\nSimilarly, for N: we are putting N at position 2? \n\nSo feedback will tell us if N is at position 2 or not? \n\nTherefore, I choose ""KNEED"".\n\n<guess>kneed</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  \n  - **C, R, A** are **absent** from the secret word.  \n  - **N** is present but **not in position 4**.  \n  - **E** is present but **not in position 5**.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""stein""** → S(x), T(x), E(✓), I(x), N(-)  \n  - **S, T, I** are **absent** from the secret word.  \n  - **E** is **correct and in position 3** (confirmed).  \n  - **N** is present but **not in position 5**.  \n\n### Key Insights\n1. **Confirmed letters**:  \n   - **E** is fixed in **position 3** (from ""stein"" feedback).  \n   - **N** is present but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from both guesses).

We are given feedback from the third guess ""kneed"": 
 K(x) -> K is not in the secret word.
 N(-) -> N is in the word but not in position 2 (since we put it at position 2).
 E(✓) -> E is correct at position 3 (as expected).
 E(-) -> The second E (at position 4) is in the word but not in position 4? Or is it absent? 
   But note: the feedback says E(-) for the fourth position. Since we have two E's in the guess, we must be careful.

 However, the feedback is given per position. So:
   Position 1: K -> x (absent)
   Position 2: N -> - (present but wrong position)
   Position 3: E -> ✓ (correct)
   Position 4: E -> - (present but wrong position? or absent? The symbol is '-', which in the rules means ""in the word but in the wrong position"". But wait, we already have one E at position 3 which is correct. So if the secret word has only one E, then the E at position 4 should be marked as 'x' (absent). But it is marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position? That implies the secret word has at least two E's? And one of them is at position 3? So the other E is elsewhere? But not at position 4.

 However, let me re-read the rules: 
   ""- : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.""

 So for the E at position 4, it is marked as '-', meaning that E is present in the word but not at position 4. Since we already have one E at position 3 (which is fixed and correct), this implies the secret word has at least two E's? 

 But note: the first guess ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. That was the same E? So the secret word has at least one E? Now we know it has at least two? 

 However, the feedback for ""kneed"" has:
   Position 4: E -> marked as '-' -> so there is another E in the word (besides the one at position 3) and it is not at position 4.

 Also, position 5: D -> marked as '-' meaning D is in the word but not at position 5.

 So to summarize:

 - K is absent.
 - N is present but not at position 2 (and we know from before not at 4 or 5, and not at 3 because E is there, so N must be at position 1? Because the only positions left are 1 and 2? But we just tried position 2 and it was wrong? So N must be at position 1? 

 Let me list the positions:

 Position 1: ? (we now know N must be here? because it can't be at 2,3,4,5? and it must be in the word)
 Position 2: ? (we don't know, but we know it's not N? because we tried and it was wrong)
 Position 3: E (fixed)
 Position 4: ? 
 Position 5: ?

 And we know:
   - The secret word has at least two E's? Because the E at position 4 was marked as present (but wrong position). But note: the E at position 3 is one, and the E at position 4 is another? Or could it be the same E? 

 But the rules: if a letter is repeated in the guess, then the feedback accounts for each occurrence separately? 

 However, the secret word might have two E's? Or one? 

 How does Wordle handle repeated letters?
   - If the secret word has one E, and you guess two E's: 
        - One of them (if in the correct position) is marked ✓.
        - The other (if in a position that is not correct) is marked x? 
        - But wait, the rules say: ""the letter is in the word"" for '-', but if the secret word has only one E, then the second E in the guess would be considered absent? 

 But in our feedback, the second E (position 4) is marked as '-', which means present but wrong position? That implies the secret word has at least two E's? 

 However, I recall that in Wordle, if the secret word has only one E, and you guess two E's, then:
   - The one in the correct position (if any) is marked ✓.
   - The other one is marked x (because the secret word doesn't have a second E).

 But in this case, we have:
   Position 3: E -> ✓ (so that one is accounted for)
   Position 4: E -> if the secret word has only one E, then this should be x? But it is marked as '-'.

 Therefore, the secret word must have at least two E's? 

 So we have:
   - The secret word has at least two E's: one at position 3, and at least one more elsewhere (but not at position 4, because that was marked as wrong position).

 Also, D is present but not at position 5 (marked as '-').

 And N must be at position 1? Because:
   - We know N is in the word.
   - It cannot be at position 2 (from this guess: N at position 2 is wrong).
   - It cannot be at position 3 (E is there).
   - It cannot be at position 4 (from first guess).
   - It cannot be at position 5 (from second guess).

 Therefore, N must be at position 1.

 So the secret word has:
   Position 1: N
   Position 3: E
   And at least one more E (so positions 2, 4, or 5 must have an E? but not position 4? because we tried E at 4 and it was wrong? So the other E must be at position 2 or 5? 

 But note: we have D present? and not at position 5? 

 So let's write what we know:

   Position 1: N (we are now sure)
   Position 2: ? (must be a letter that is not K, and not C,R,A,S,T,I, and also, it could be E? or D? or other? but note: we have an extra E to place? and D is present but not at 5)
   Position 3: E
   Position 4: ? (cannot be E? because we tried and it was wrong? but wait: we tried E at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong? meaning that there is an E in the word that is not at position 4? but we already have one at 3? and we know there's at least one more? but that one cannot be at 4? so it must be at 2 or 5? so position 4 is not E? 
   Position 5: ? (could be E? or D? but D is present and not at 5? so if D is not at 5, then position 5 could be E? or another letter? 

 But note: D is present and not at position 5? so D must be at position 2 or 4? 

 Also, we have at least two E's: one at 3, and one more at either 2 or 5? 

 So the secret word is: N, [letter2], E, [letter4], [letter5]

 Constraints:
   - letter2: can be E or D or another letter? but we know D is present? and we have to account for it? 
   - letter4: cannot be E? and must be a letter that is not K, C,R,A,S,T,I, and also, we know D might be here? 
   - letter5: can be E? or if not, then we have to have the second E at position 2? 

 But we also have the D that must be placed? 

 Let me list the possibilities for the second E and D:

 Case 1: The second E is at position 2.
   Then the word: N, E, E, [letter4], [letter5]
   And D is present? but not at position 5? so D must be at position 4? 
   So: N, E, E, D, [letter5]
   But we have D at position 4? and we know D is not at position 5? so that's consistent? 
   But what about the feedback for D in guess 3? We put D at position 5 and it was marked as '-'? meaning D is in the word but not at 5? so if we put D at position 4? that's allowed? 

 Case 2: The second E is at position 5.
   Then the word: N, [letter2], E, [letter4], E
   And D is present? and not at 5? so D must be at position 2 or 4? 
   But note: we have two possibilities for D? 

 However, we also have the feedback from the first guess: E was at position 5 and marked as '-'? meaning that E is in the word but not at 5? 
   But wait: in this case, we are putting E at position 5? which would be the second E? 
   But the first guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as not there? meaning that the secret word does not have an E at position 5? 

 Therefore, we cannot have E at position 5? 

 So Case 2 is impossible? 

 Therefore, the only possibility is:
   Position 1: N
   Position 2: E
   Position 3: E
   Position 4: D
   Position 5: ? 

 But wait, we have the second E at position 2? and then we need a D? and we have one D? 

 But what about the fifth letter? 

 The word would be: N E E D ?

 And we know the secret word has at least two E's? and we have two E's? 

 But we also have the D? 

 Now, what about the fifth letter? 

 We know from the feedback that D is present? and we are putting it at position 4? 

 But we also have the fifth letter? 

 And we know that the secret word has D? and we are putting it at position 4? 

 But in the third guess, we put D at position 5 and it was marked as '-'? meaning that D is in the word but not at 5? so if we put D at position 4? that's consistent? 

 Now, the fifth letter: what could it be? 

 We know the secret word has no K, C, R, A, S, T, I? 

 And we have used: N, E, D? 

 So the fifth letter must be one of: B, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

 But we also know that the secret word has exactly these letters: N, E, E, D, and one more? 

 Now, we need to find a word: ""NEED?"" 

 The word ""NEED"" is 4 letters? So it must be ""NEEDY"", ""NEEDS"", etc? But S is excluded? 

 ""NEEDY"" has Y? 

 Let me check: ""NEEDY"" is a word? 

 But we have:
   Position 1: N
   Position 2: E
   Position 3: E
   Position 4: D
   Position 5: Y

 Is that valid? 

 But we have to check if Y is allowed? 

 Also, we have not used Y before? 

 But we don't have any information about Y? 

 Alternatively, ""NEEDY"" is a valid English word? 

 But wait: we have two E's? and then D and Y? 

 However, we must confirm: is there a word ""NEEDY""? Yes, meaning poor.

 But we have to make sure that the letter Y is not excluded? 

 We haven't guessed Y? and it's not in the excluded list? 

 But note: the feedback for the third guess: D at position 5 was marked as '-'? meaning D is present? and we are putting D at position 4? so that's okay? 

 But what about the fifth letter? We are putting Y? 

 However, we don't know if Y is in the word? 

 But we are trying to guess the word? 

 Alternatively, we can try to think of other words? 

 What about ""NEEDY""? 

 But let me see if there are other possibilities? 

 The word could be ""NEEDS"", but S is excluded? 

 ""NEEDY"" is the only common 5-letter word starting with ""NEED""? 

 What about ""NEEDN"" -> not a word? 

 Or ""NEED"" with a different last letter? 

 ""NEEDY"" is the only one? 

 But wait, what about ""NEVEL""? -> not a word? 

 Or ""NEEZE""? -> not? 

 So ""NEEDY"" is a candidate? 

 But we have to be cautious: we are assuming that the second E is at position 2? and D at position 4? 

 But we have not confirmed the fifth letter? 

 However, we have one more constraint: the feedback from the first guess: E was in the word but not at position 5? and we are not putting E at position 5? 

 And in the third guess, we had E at position 4 marked as '-'? meaning that there is an E that is not at position 4? and we are putting that E at position 2? 

 So the word is N E E D ? 

 And the only common word is ""NEEDY"". 

 But let me check: is there a word ""NEEDY""? Yes. 

 Therefore, I will guess ""NEEDY"". 

 However, note: we have not used the letter Y in any previous guess? 

 But we are allowed? 

 Alternatively, we can try to confirm with another guess? But we have 3 guesses left? 

 But if we are confident? 

 But let me double-check the feedback:

   First guess: crane -> N was present (but not at 4) and E present (but not at 5).
   Second guess: stein -> E at 3 correct, N present but not at 5.
   Third guess: kneed -> 
        K absent, 
        N present but not at 2 (so N must be at 1), 
        E at 3 correct, 
        E at 4: present but not at 4 (so there is another E? and it must be at 2? because 1 is N, 3 is E, 4 is not, 5 is not? and we have to place it? and also D present but not at 5? so D must be at 4? 

 Then the word is N E E D ? 

 And the fifth letter must be a letter that forms a word? 

 ""NEEDY"" is a word? 

 But what about the D? In the third guess, we put D at position 5 and it was marked as '-'? meaning D is present? and we are putting it at position 4? so that's consistent? 

 And the fifth letter is Y? 

 So I think ""NEEDY"" is the answer? 

 But let me see if there is any other possibility? 

 What if the secret word has three E's? 
   Then we could have E at position 5? but the first guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as not there? so no? 

 Therefore, the only possibility is ""NEEDY"". 

 So I'll go with that.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - C(x), R(x), A(x) → **C, R, A** are **absent**.  
   - N(-) → **N** is present but **not in position 4**.  
   - E(-) → **E** is present but **not in position 5**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""stein""**  
   - S(x), T(x), I(x) → **S, T, I** are **absent**.  
   - E(✓) → **E** is **correct in position 3**.  
   - N(-) → **N** is present but **not in position 5**.  

3. **Guess 3: ""kneed""**  
   - K(x) → **K** is **absent**.  
   - N(-) → **N** is present but **not in position 2**.  
   - E(✓) → **E** is **correct in position 3** (reconfirmed).  
   - E(-) → **E** is present but **not in position 4** (indicating a **second E** exists).  
   - D(-) → **D** is present but **not in position 5**.  

### Key Insights
- **Position 3 is E** (fixed from Guess 2 and 3).  
- **N must be in position 1**:  
  - N cannot be in positions 2 (from Guess 3), 3 (occupied by E), 4 (from Guess 1), or 5 (from Guess 2).  
- **Secret word has two E's**:  
  - One E is fixed at position 3.  
  - The second E must be in position 2 (since position 4 is invalid per Guess 3 feedback).  
- **D is present** but not in position 5 (from Guess 3).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T, I, K.  
- **Word structure**:  
  - Position 1: **N**  
  - Position 2: **E** (second E)  
  - Position 3: **E**  
  - Position 4: **D** (only remaining position for D)  
  - Position 5: Unknown (must be a letter not excluded and forms a valid word).  

### Deduced Secret Word: ""NEEDY""
- **N** in position 1.  
- **E** in position 2 (second E).  
- **E** in position 3.  
- **D** in position 4 (only valid slot left for D).  
- **Y** in position 5 (only common letter fitting the word ""NEEDY"").  

""NEEDY"" is a valid 5-letter word (meaning ""lacking the necessities of life""), and it satisfies all constraints:  
- Contains N, E (twice), D, and Y.  
- No excluded letters (C, R, A, S, T, I, K).  
- Positions align with feedback (E at 3, N at 1, D not at 5).  

<guess>needy</guess>",needy,"We are given feedback from the third guess ""kneed"": 
 K(x) -> K is not in the secret word.
 N(-) -> N is in the word but not in position 2 (since we put it at position 2).
 E(✓) -> E is correct at position 3 (as expected).
 E(-) -> The second E (at position 4) is in the word but not in position 4? Or is it absent? 
   But note: the feedback says E(-) for the fourth position. Since we have two E's in the guess, we must be careful.

 However, the feedback is given per position. So:
   Position 1: K -> x (absent)
   Position 2: N -> - (present but wrong position)
   Position 3: E -> ✓ (correct)
   Position 4: E -> - (present but wrong position? or absent? The symbol is '-', which in the rules means ""in the word but in the wrong position"". But wait, we already have one E at position 3 which is correct. So if the secret word has only one E, then the E at position 4 should be marked as 'x' (absent). But it is marked as '-', meaning present but wrong position? That implies the secret word has at least two E's? And one of them is at position 3? So the other E is elsewhere? But not at position 4.

 However, let me re-read the rules: 
   ""- : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.""

 So for the E at position 4, it is marked as '-', meaning that E is present in the word but not at position 4. Since we already have one E at position 3 (which is fixed and correct), this implies the secret word has at least two E's? 

 But note: the first guess ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position. That was the same E? So the secret word has at least one E? Now we know it has at least two? 

 However, the feedback for ""kneed"" has:
   Position 4: E -> marked as '-' -> so there is another E in the word (besides the one at position 3) and it is not at position 4.

 Also, position 5: D -> marked as '-' meaning D is in the word but not at position 5.

 So to summarize:

 - K is absent.
 - N is present but not at position 2 (and we know from before not at 4 or 5, and not at 3 because E is there, so N must be at position 1? Because the only positions left are 1 and 2? But we just tried position 2 and it was wrong? So N must be at position 1? 

 Let me list the positions:

 Position 1: ? (we now know N must be here? because it can't be at 2,3,4,5? and it must be in the word)
 Position 2: ? (we don't know, but we know it's not N? because we tried and it was wrong)
 Position 3: E (fixed)
 Position 4: ? 
 Position 5: ?

 And we know:
   - The secret word has at least two E's? Because the E at position 4 was marked as present (but wrong position). But note: the E at position 3 is one, and the E at position 4 is another? Or could it be the same E? 

 But the rules: if a letter is repeated in the guess, then the feedback accounts for each occurrence separately? 

 However, the secret word might have two E's? Or one? 

 How does Wordle handle repeated letters?
   - If the secret word has one E, and you guess two E's: 
        - One of them (if in the correct position) is marked ✓.
        - The other (if in a position that is not correct) is marked x? 
        - But wait, the rules say: ""the letter is in the word"" for '-', but if the secret word has only one E, then the second E in the guess would be considered absent? 

 But in our feedback, the second E (position 4) is marked as '-', which means present but wrong position? That implies the secret word has at least two E's? 

 However, I recall that in Wordle, if the secret word has only one E, and you guess two E's, then:
   - The one in the correct position (if any) is marked ✓.
   - The other one is marked x (because the secret word doesn't have a second E).

 But in this case, we have:
   Position 3: E -> ✓ (so that one is accounted for)
   Position 4: E -> if the secret word has only one E, then this should be x? But it is marked as '-'.

 Therefore, the secret word must have at least two E's? 

 So we have:
   - The secret word has at least two E's: one at position 3, and at least one more elsewhere (but not at position 4, because that was marked as wrong position).

 Also, D is present but not at position 5 (marked as '-').

 And N must be at position 1? Because:
   - We know N is in the word.
   - It cannot be at position 2 (from this guess: N at position 2 is wrong).
   - It cannot be at position 3 (E is there).
   - It cannot be at position 4 (from first guess).
   - It cannot be at position 5 (from second guess).

 Therefore, N must be at position 1.

 So the secret word has:
   Position 1: N
   Position 3: E
   And at least one more E (so positions 2, 4, or 5 must have an E? but not position 4? because we tried E at 4 and it was wrong? So the other E must be at position 2 or 5? 

 But note: we have D present? and not at position 5? 

 So let's write what we know:

   Position 1: N (we are now sure)
   Position 2: ? (must be a letter that is not K, and not C,R,A,S,T,I, and also, it could be E? or D? or other? but note: we have an extra E to place? and D is present but not at 5)
   Position 3: E
   Position 4: ? (cannot be E? because we tried and it was wrong? but wait: we tried E at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong? meaning that there is an E in the word that is not at position 4? but we already have one at 3? and we know there's at least one more? but that one cannot be at 4? so it must be at 2 or 5? so position 4 is not E? 
   Position 5: ? (could be E? or D? but D is present and not at 5? so if D is not at 5, then position 5 could be E? or another letter? 

 But note: D is present and not at position 5? so D must be at position 2 or 4? 

 Also, we have at least two E's: one at 3, and one more at either 2 or 5? 

 So the secret word is: N, [letter2], E, [letter4], [letter5]

 Constraints:
   - letter2: can be E or D or another letter? but we know D is present? and we have to account for it? 
   - letter4: cannot be E? and must be a letter that is not K, C,R,A,S,T,I, and also, we know D might be here? 
   - letter5: can be E? or if not, then we have to have the second E at position 2? 

 But we also have the D that must be placed? 

 Let me list the possibilities for the second E and D:

 Case 1: The second E is at position 2.
   Then the word: N, E, E, [letter4], [letter5]
   And D is present? but not at position 5? so D must be at position 4? 
   So: N, E, E, D, [letter5]
   But we have D at position 4? and we know D is not at position 5? so that's consistent? 
   But what about the feedback for D in guess 3? We put D at position 5 and it was marked as '-'? meaning D is in the word but not at 5? so if we put D at position 4? that's allowed? 

 Case 2: The second E is at position 5.
   Then the word: N, [letter2], E, [letter4], E
   And D is present? and not at 5? so D must be at position 2 or 4? 
   But note: we have two possibilities for D? 

 However, we also have the feedback from the first guess: E was at position 5 and marked as '-'? meaning that E is in the word but not at 5? 
   But wait: in this case, we are putting E at position 5? which would be the second E? 
   But the first guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as not there? meaning that the secret word does not have an E at position 5? 

 Therefore, we cannot have E at position 5? 

 So Case 2 is impossible? 

 Therefore, the only possibility is:
   Position 1: N
   Position 2: E
   Position 3: E
   Position 4: D
   Position 5: ? 

 But wait, we have the second E at position 2? and then we need a D? and we have one D? 

 But what about the fifth letter? 

 The word would be: N E E D ?

 And we know the secret word has at least two E's? and we have two E's? 

 But we also have the D? 

 Now, what about the fifth letter? 

 We know from the feedback that D is present? and we are putting it at position 4? 

 But we also have the fifth letter? 

 And we know that the secret word has D? and we are putting it at position 4? 

 But in the third guess, we put D at position 5 and it was marked as '-'? meaning that D is in the word but not at 5? so if we put D at position 4? that's consistent? 

 Now, the fifth letter: what could it be? 

 We know the secret word has no K, C, R, A, S, T, I? 

 And we have used: N, E, D? 

 So the fifth letter must be one of: B, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? 

 But we also know that the secret word has exactly these letters: N, E, E, D, and one more? 

 Now, we need to find a word: ""NEED?"" 

 The word ""NEED"" is 4 letters? So it must be ""NEEDY"", ""NEEDS"", etc? But S is excluded? 

 ""NEEDY"" has Y? 

 Let me check: ""NEEDY"" is a word? 

 But we have:
   Position 1: N
   Position 2: E
   Position 3: E
   Position 4: D
   Position 5: Y

 Is that valid? 

 But we have to check if Y is allowed? 

 Also, we have not used Y before? 

 But we don't have any information about Y? 

 Alternatively, ""NEEDY"" is a valid English word? 

 But wait: we have two E's? and then D and Y? 

 However, we must confirm: is there a word ""NEEDY""? Yes, meaning poor.

 But we have to make sure that the letter Y is not excluded? 

 We haven't guessed Y? and it's not in the excluded list? 

 But note: the feedback for the third guess: D at position 5 was marked as '-'? meaning D is present? and we are putting D at position 4? so that's okay? 

 But what about the fifth letter? We are putting Y? 

 However, we don't know if Y is in the word? 

 But we are trying to guess the word? 

 Alternatively, we can try to think of other words? 

 What about ""NEEDY""? 

 But let me see if there are other possibilities? 

 The word could be ""NEEDS"", but S is excluded? 

 ""NEEDY"" is the only common 5-letter word starting with ""NEED""? 

 What about ""NEEDN"" -> not a word? 

 Or ""NEED"" with a different last letter? 

 ""NEEDY"" is the only one? 

 But wait, what about ""NEVEL""? -> not a word? 

 Or ""NEEZE""? -> not? 

 So ""NEEDY"" is a candidate? 

 But we have to be cautious: we are assuming that the second E is at position 2? and D at position 4? 

 But we have not confirmed the fifth letter? 

 However, we have one more constraint: the feedback from the first guess: E was in the word but not at position 5? and we are not putting E at position 5? 

 And in the third guess, we had E at position 4 marked as '-'? meaning that there is an E that is not at position 4? and we are putting that E at position 2? 

 So the word is N E E D ? 

 And the only common word is ""NEEDY"". 

 But let me check: is there a word ""NEEDY""? Yes. 

 Therefore, I will guess ""NEEDY"". 

 However, note: we have not used the letter Y in any previous guess? 

 But we are allowed? 

 Alternatively, we can try to confirm with another guess? But we have 3 guesses left? 

 But if we are confident? 

 But let me double-check the feedback:

   First guess: crane -> N was present (but not at 4) and E present (but not at 5).
   Second guess: stein -> E at 3 correct, N present but not at 5.
   Third guess: kneed -> 
        K absent, 
        N present but not at 2 (so N must be at 1), 
        E at 3 correct, 
        E at 4: present but not at 4 (so there is another E? and it must be at 2? because 1 is N, 3 is E, 4 is not, 5 is not? and we have to place it? and also D present but not at 5? so D must be at 4? 

 Then the word is N E E D ? 

 And the fifth letter must be a letter that forms a word? 

 ""NEEDY"" is a word? 

 But what about the D? In the third guess, we put D at position 5 and it was marked as '-'? meaning D is present? and we are putting it at position 4? so that's consistent? 

 And the fifth letter is Y? 

 So I think ""NEEDY"" is the answer? 

 But let me see if there is any other possibility? 

 What if the secret word has three E's? 
   Then we could have E at position 5? but the first guess had E at position 5 and it was marked as not there? so no? 

 Therefore, the only possibility is ""NEEDY"". 

 So I'll go with that.

<guess>needy</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - C(x), R(x), A(x) → **C, R, A** are **absent**.  
   - N(-) → **N** is present but **not in position 4**.  
   - E(-) → **E** is present but **not in position 5**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""stein""**  
   - S(x), T(x), I(x) → **S, T, I** are **absent**.  
   - E(✓) → **E** is **correct in position 3**.  
   - N(-) → **N** is present but **not in position 5**.  

3. **Guess 3: ""kneed""**  
   - K(x) → **K** is **absent**.  
   - N(-) → **N** is present but **not in position 2**.  
   - E(✓) → **E** is **correct in position 3** (reconfirmed).  
   - E(-) → **E** is present but **not in position 4** (indicating a **second E** exists).  
   - D(-) → **D** is present but **not in position 5**.  

### Key Insights
- **Position 3 is E** (fixed from Guess 2 and 3).  
- **N must be in position 1**:  
  - N cannot be in positions 2 (from Guess 3), 3 (occupied by E), 4 (from Guess 1), or 5 (from Guess 2).  
- **Secret word has two E's**:  
  - One E is fixed at position 3.  
  - The second E must be in position 2 (since position 4 is invalid per Guess 3 feedback).  
- **D is present** but not in position 5 (from Guess 3).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T, I, K.  
- **Word structure**:  
  - Position 1: **N**  
  - Position 2: **E** (second E)  
  - Position 3: **E**  
  - Position 4: **D** (only remaining position for D)  
  - Position 5: Unknown (must be a letter not excluded and forms a valid word).  

### Deduced Secret Word: ""NEEDY""
- **N** in position 1.  
- **E** in position 2 (second E).  
- **E** in position 3.  
- **D** in position 4 (only valid slot left for D).  
- **Y** in position 5 (only common letter fitting the word ""NEEDY"").  

""NEEDY"" is a valid 5-letter word (meaning ""lacking the necessities of life""), and it satisfies all constraints:  
- Contains N, E (twice), D, and Y.  
- No excluded letters (C, R, A, S, T, I, K).  
- Positions align with feedback (E at 3, N at 1, D not at 5).",Guess 4: needy -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) E(✓) E(✓) D(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
