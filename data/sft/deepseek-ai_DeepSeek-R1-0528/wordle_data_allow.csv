We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the secret word)
 R: x (not in the secret word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the secret word)
 E: x (not in the secret word)

 So, from this we know:
 - The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess at position 3 and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' (but not at position 3) and does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we know the secret word has 5 letters and must include 'A', we can try to think of words that have 'A' in them, but not in the third position, and without the letters C, R, N, E.

 Also, note that the first guess was ""crane"", so we have eliminated those letters.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Is a valid 5-letter English word.
 - Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 - Contains the letter 'A', but not at position 3 (because in ""crane"", 'A' was at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position).

 However, note that the feedback for 'A' being present but not at position 3 does not necessarily mean it cannot be at position 3 in the secret word? Actually, wait: in the feedback, the '-' for 'A' means that the letter is in the word but not at that position. So the secret word has an 'A' but not at position 3.

 But note: the secret word might have more than one 'A'. However, we don't know that yet.

 We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test more common letters.

 Since we have eliminated C, R, N, E, we can try to use other common letters.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

 We also know that the word must contain an 'A'. So let's think of words that have an 'A' and avoid C, R, N, E.

 Also, we don't know the position of 'A', so we can try to put it in a different position.

 Let's try to choose a word that has:
 - 'A' in a position that is not 3 (so positions 1,2,4,5) and also includes other common letters that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SALAD"", but note that we have to avoid the letters we know are absent. However, in ""SALAD"", we have:
   S, A, L, A, D.

 But wait: we have two A's. That's acceptable because we don't know if the secret word has two A's.

 However, we must avoid R, N, E, C? Yes, and R, N, E, C are not in ""SALAD"". So it's a candidate.

 But let's see: we want to maximize information. We know that the word has at least one 'A'. If we use two A's, we might get information about whether there are two A's.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with only one 'A' and other new letters.

 Another idea: since we know the word has an 'A', we can try to put the 'A' in a different position to narrow down.

 In the first guess, 'A' was at position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let me think of common words:

 Option 1: ""AUDIO"" -> but that has A at position 1, and also U, D, I, O. But note: we haven't tested U, D, I, O. However, we must avoid R, N, E, C? Yes, and AUDIO doesn't have those. But wait, we also know that R is absent? Yes, from the first feedback R was marked as absent. So AUDIO is acceptable.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word has an 'A' and we are putting it at position 1. If the secret word has the 'A' at position 1, then we would get a check (✓) for the first letter. If not, then we get a dash (-) meaning it's in the word but not at 1. Also, we get to test U, D, I, O.

 However, we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess said that 'A' is in the word but not at position 3. It could be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Another option: ""PASTA"" -> but that has P, A, S, T, A. Again, no R, N, E, C. And we test P, S, T.

 But note: we have two A's again.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has the 'A' in position 2, for example: ""SAULT"" (but SAULT is not very common, and we might prefer more common words).

 Another common word: ""SLATE"" -> but wait, we know E is absent (from first feedback: E was marked as absent). So we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use R, N, C.

 So we must avoid E, R, N, C.

 Let me list some words that have an 'A' and avoid E, R, N, C:

 - SALAD: S, A, L, A, D -> positions: S1, A2, L3, A4, D5 -> we have A at 2 and 4.
 - PASTA: P1, A2, S3, T4, A5 -> A at 2 and 5.
 - PASTY: but Y is not very common and also we have to avoid E? Pastry has R? No, PASTY is P,A,S,T,Y -> but we don't know about Y. However, it's a valid word.
 - PLAIT: but has L, A, I, T? and P. But note: we don't know about P, L, I, T. However, it has an 'A' at position 3? But wait, we are not supposed to put 'A' at position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3 again? But the feedback said that the secret word has an 'A' but not at position 3. So if we put an 'A' at position 3 and it is the same as the secret word's 'A'? Actually, no: because the secret word's 'A' is not at position 3. So if we put an 'A' at position 3 and the secret word has only one 'A', then we would get an 'x' for that. But if the secret word has two A's, one of which is at position 3? But wait, the feedback for the first guess said that the 'A' at position 3 is present but in the wrong position? That would be contradictory because if the secret word has an 'A' at position 3, then the first guess would have gotten a check (✓) for the 'A' at position 3? But it didn't, it got a dash (-). So the secret word does not have an 'A' at position 3. Therefore, if we put an 'A' at position 3 in our new guess, we would get an 'x' for that position (if the secret word has only one 'A') or a dash for that position if the secret word has another 'A' that is not at position 3? Actually, no: the dash means that the letter is in the word but not at that position. So if we put an 'A' at position 3 and the secret word has an 'A' but not at position 3 (and also not at that same position in the secret word) then we would get a dash? But wait, the feedback is per letter occurrence. If the secret word has two A's, and we have two A's in our guess, then each A in the guess is evaluated independently.

 However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to avoid putting the 'A' at position 3 again because we know it's not there. We can put it in a different position to test.

 So let's choose a word that has an 'A' in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and also includes other common letters we haven't tried.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:
 - It has A at position 1 (so we test if the secret word has A at position 1).
 - It has U, D, I, O which are common and we haven't tested.

 But note: the secret word might not have any of these, but we are trying to get information.

 However, we must consider that the secret word has at least one 'A'. So if we put 'A' at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash meaning it's in the word but not at 1. Then we also test U, D, I, O.

 But wait: what if the secret word has two A's? Then we might get a dash for the first A and then we don't have another A in the word to test? So we wouldn't know about the second A. But that's okay because we are still in the early stage.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has only one 'A' and in a new position, and also includes other common letters.

 Another common word: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. The 'A' is at position 3? But we are avoiding position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3? But we know the secret word does not have an 'A' at position 3. So if we put an 'A' at position 3, we expect it to be marked as absent (if the secret word has only one 'A') or as present but wrong position (if there is a second 'A' elsewhere). But that might be confusing. So to avoid that, let's not put the 'A' at position 3.

 In ""STAMP"", the 'A' is at position 3. So we avoid that.

 How about ""PASTA""? It has two A's: one at position 2 and one at position 5. We avoid position 3. So we can use that.

 But let me check: P, A, S, T, A. We haven't tested P, S, T. And we avoid R, N, E, C.

 So ""PASTA"" is a valid word.

 Another option: ""SAULT"" (which is a word, meaning a leap or a jump, but not very common). Or ""SALTY"", but we know E is absent? SALTY has T and Y, but we don't know about T and Y. However, we also have to avoid E? Yes, and SALTY doesn't have E.

 But I think ""PASTA"" is more common.

 Alternatively, ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> has A at position 2. And we test D, I, L, Y.

 But note: we don't know about D, I, L, Y.

 However, we are trying to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, etc.

 In ""PASTA"": we test P, A, S, T, A -> so we test P, S, T and two A's.

 In ""AUDIO"": we test A, U, D, I, O.

 Which one gives more information? Both are good.

 But note: we already know that the word has an 'A'. So testing two A's in ""PASTA"" might be less efficient if the word has only one A. But if it has two, then we get more information.

 However, I think I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests more vowels and we haven't tested any vowels except A (and we know E is absent). So we can test U, I, O.

 But wait: the first guess had A and E? And we know E is absent. So we have only tested A and E? And E is absent. So we have not tested any other vowels? So testing U, I, O is good.

 Also, we are putting A at position 1.

 So let's choose ""AUDIO"".

 But note: the word must be in the word list. I believe ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""AUDIO"".

<guess>audio</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.
- A is **present** but **not in position 3**.

For the second guess:
- Must include **A** (in a position other than 3) and avoid C, R, N, E.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, U, D, I) to maximize information.
- ""AUDIO"" is chosen because:
  - Places A in position 1 (testing if A is correctly placed there).
  - Introduces new common letters U, D, I, O (vowels and consonants not yet tested).
  - Avoids reused letters (C, R, N, E) and covers multiple positions.

<guess>audio</guess>",audio,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the secret word)
 R: x (not in the secret word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the secret word)

 So, from this we know:
 - The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess at position 3 and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' (but not at position 3) and does not contain C, R, N, E.

 A good candidate might be ""SALAD"", but note that we have to avoid the letters we know are absent. However, in ""SALAD"", we have:

 So let's choose a word that has an 'A' in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and also includes other common letters we haven't tried.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:
 - It has A at position 1 (so we test if the secret word has A at position 1).
 - It has U, D, I, O which are common and we haven't tested.

 But note: the secret word might not have any of these, but we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has only one 'A' and in a new position, and also includes other common letters.

 Another common word: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. The 'A' is at position 3? But we are avoiding position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3? But we know the secret word does not have an 'A' at position 3. So if we put an 'A' at position 3, we expect it to be marked as absent (if the secret word has only one 'A') or as present but wrong position (if there is a second 'A' elsewhere). But that might be confusing. So to avoid that, let's not put the 'A' at position 3.

 In ""STAMP"", the 'A' is at position 3. So we avoid that.

 How about ""PASTA""? It has two A's: one at position 2 and one at position 5. We avoid position 3. So we can use that.

 But let me check: P, A, S, T, A. We haven't tested P, S, T. And we avoid R, N, E, C.

 So ""PASTA"" is a valid word.

 Which one gives more information? Both are good.

 But note: we already know that the word has an 'A'. So testing two A's in ""PASTA"" might be less efficient if the word has only one A. But if it has two, then we get more information.

 However, I think I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests more vowels and we haven't tested any vowels except A (and we know E is absent). So we can test U, I, O.

 But wait: the first guess had A and E? And we know E is absent. So we have only tested A and E? And E is absent. So we have not tested any other vowels? So testing U, I, O is good.

 Also, we are putting A at position 1.

 So let's choose ""AUDIO"".

 But note: the word must be in the word list. I believe ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""AUDIO"".

<guess>audio</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.
- A is **present** but **not in position 3**.

For the second guess:
- Must include **A** (in a position other than 3) and avoid C, R, N, E.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, U, D, I) to maximize information.
- ""AUDIO"" is chosen because:
  - Places A in position 1 (testing if A is correctly placed there).
  - Introduces new common letters U, D, I, O (vowels and consonants not yet tested).
  - Avoids reused letters (C, R, N, E) and covers multiple positions.",Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,allow,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the secret word)
 R: x (not in the secret word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the secret word)
 E: x (not in the secret word)

 So, from this we know:
 - The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess at position 3 and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' (but not at position 3) and does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we know the secret word has 5 letters and must include 'A', we can try to think of words that have 'A' in them, but not in the third position, and without the letters C, R, N, E.

 Also, note that the first guess was ""crane"", so we have eliminated those letters.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Is a valid 5-letter English word.
 - Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 - Contains the letter 'A', but not at position 3 (because in ""crane"", 'A' was at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position).

 However, note that the feedback for 'A' being present but not at position 3 does not necessarily mean it cannot be at position 3 in the secret word? Actually, wait: in the feedback, the '-' for 'A' means that the letter is in the word but not at that position. So the secret word has an 'A' but not at position 3.

 But note: the secret word might have more than one 'A'. However, we don't know that yet.

 We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test more common letters.

 Since we have eliminated C, R, N, E, we can try to use other common letters.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

 We also know that the word must contain an 'A'. So let's think of words that have an 'A' and avoid C, R, N, E.

 Also, we don't know the position of 'A', so we can try to put it in a different position.

 Let's try to choose a word that has:
 - 'A' in a position that is not 3 (so positions 1,2,4,5) and also includes other common letters that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SALAD"", but note that we have to avoid the letters we know are absent. However, in ""SALAD"", we have:
   S, A, L, A, D.

 But wait: we have two A's. That's acceptable because we don't know if the secret word has two A's.

 However, we must avoid R, N, E, C? Yes, and R, N, E, C are not in ""SALAD"". So it's a candidate.

 But let's see: we want to maximize information. We know that the word has at least one 'A'. If we use two A's, we might get information about whether there are two A's.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with only one 'A' and other new letters.

 Another idea: since we know the word has an 'A', we can try to put the 'A' in a different position to narrow down.

 In the first guess, 'A' was at position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let me think of common words:

 Option 1: ""AUDIO"" -> but that has A at position 1, and also U, D, I, O. But note: we haven't tested U, D, I, O. However, we must avoid R, N, E, C? Yes, and AUDIO doesn't have those. But wait, we also know that R is absent? Yes, from the first feedback R was marked as absent. So AUDIO is acceptable.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word has an 'A' and we are putting it at position 1. If the secret word has the 'A' at position 1, then we would get a check (✓) for the first letter. If not, then we get a dash (-) meaning it's in the word but not at 1. Also, we get to test U, D, I, O.

 However, we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess said that 'A' is in the word but not at position 3. It could be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Another option: ""PASTA"" -> but that has P, A, S, T, A. Again, no R, N, E, C. And we test P, S, T.

 But note: we have two A's again.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has the 'A' in position 2, for example: ""SAULT"" (but SAULT is not very common, and we might prefer more common words).

 Another common word: ""SLATE"" -> but wait, we know E is absent (from first feedback: E was marked as absent). So we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use R, N, C.

 So we must avoid E, R, N, C.

 Let me list some words that have an 'A' and avoid E, R, N, C:

 - SALAD: S, A, L, A, D -> positions: S1, A2, L3, A4, D5 -> we have A at 2 and 4.
 - PASTA: P1, A2, S3, T4, A5 -> A at 2 and 5.
 - PASTY: but Y is not very common and also we have to avoid E? Pastry has R? No, PASTY is P,A,S,T,Y -> but we don't know about Y. However, it's a valid word.
 - PLAIT: but has L, A, I, T? and P. But note: we don't know about P, L, I, T. However, it has an 'A' at position 3? But wait, we are not supposed to put 'A' at position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3 again? But the feedback said that the secret word has an 'A' but not at position 3. So if we put an 'A' at position 3 and it is the same as the secret word's 'A'? Actually, no: because the secret word's 'A' is not at position 3. So if we put an 'A' at position 3 and the secret word has only one 'A', then we would get an 'x' for that. But if the secret word has two A's, one of which is at position 3? But wait, the feedback for the first guess said that the 'A' at position 3 is present but in the wrong position? That would be contradictory because if the secret word has an 'A' at position 3, then the first guess would have gotten a check (✓) for the 'A' at position 3? But it didn't, it got a dash (-). So the secret word does not have an 'A' at position 3. Therefore, if we put an 'A' at position 3 in our new guess, we would get an 'x' for that position (if the secret word has only one 'A') or a dash for that position if the secret word has another 'A' that is not at position 3? Actually, no: the dash means that the letter is in the word but not at that position. So if we put an 'A' at position 3 and the secret word has an 'A' but not at position 3 (and also not at that same position in the secret word) then we would get a dash? But wait, the feedback is per letter occurrence. If the secret word has two A's, and we have two A's in our guess, then each A in the guess is evaluated independently.

 However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to avoid putting the 'A' at position 3 again because we know it's not there. We can put it in a different position to test.

 So let's choose a word that has an 'A' in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and also includes other common letters we haven't tried.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:
 - It has A at position 1 (so we test if the secret word has A at position 1).
 - It has U, D, I, O which are common and we haven't tested.

 But note: the secret word might not have any of these, but we are trying to get information.

 However, we must consider that the secret word has at least one 'A'. So if we put 'A' at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash meaning it's in the word but not at 1. Then we also test U, D, I, O.

 But wait: what if the secret word has two A's? Then we might get a dash for the first A and then we don't have another A in the word to test? So we wouldn't know about the second A. But that's okay because we are still in the early stage.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has only one 'A' and in a new position, and also includes other common letters.

 Another common word: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. The 'A' is at position 3? But we are avoiding position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3? But we know the secret word does not have an 'A' at position 3. So if we put an 'A' at position 3, we expect it to be marked as absent (if the secret word has only one 'A') or as present but wrong position (if there is a second 'A' elsewhere). But that might be confusing. So to avoid that, let's not put the 'A' at position 3.

 In ""STAMP"", the 'A' is at position 3. So we avoid that.

 How about ""PASTA""? It has two A's: one at position 2 and one at position 5. We avoid position 3. So we can use that.

 But let me check: P, A, S, T, A. We haven't tested P, S, T. And we avoid R, N, E, C.

 So ""PASTA"" is a valid word.

 Another option: ""SAULT"" (which is a word, meaning a leap or a jump, but not very common). Or ""SALTY"", but we know E is absent? SALTY has T and Y, but we don't know about T and Y. However, we also have to avoid E? Yes, and SALTY doesn't have E.

 But I think ""PASTA"" is more common.

 Alternatively, ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> has A at position 2. And we test D, I, L, Y.

 But note: we don't know about D, I, L, Y.

 However, we are trying to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, etc.

 In ""PASTA"": we test P, A, S, T, A -> so we test P, S, T and two A's.

 In ""AUDIO"": we test A, U, D, I, O.

 Which one gives more information? Both are good.

 But note: we already know that the word has an 'A'. So testing two A's in ""PASTA"" might be less efficient if the word has only one A. But if it has two, then we get more information.

 However, I think I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests more vowels and we haven't tested any vowels except A (and we know E is absent). So we can test U, I, O.

 But wait: the first guess had A and E? And we know E is absent. So we have only tested A and E? And E is absent. So we have not tested any other vowels? So testing U, I, O is good.

 Also, we are putting A at position 1.

 So let's choose ""AUDIO"".

 But note: the word must be in the word list. I believe ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""AUDIO"".

<guess>audio</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

We are given feedback for two guesses.
First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Second guess: ""audio"" -> Feedback: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)

From first guess:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not at position 3 (from crane, A was at position 3).

From second guess: ""audio""
- A: ✓ -> This means that A is in the secret word and at position 1. So the secret word starts with A.
- U: x -> U is not in the word.
- D: x -> D is not in the word.
- I: x -> I is not in the word.
- O: - -> O is in the word but not at position 5 (since in audio, O was at position 5).

So we now know:
- The secret word starts with A (position 1 is A).
- A is also not at position 3 (from first guess) but we now know it's at position 1.
- O is in the word, but not at position 5.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I (from both guesses).

Also, from the first guess, we know A is not at position 3, but now we have A fixed at position 1.

Therefore, the secret word is: A _ _ _ _

Where:
- The first letter is A.
- The word contains O (but not at position 5).
- Does not contain: C, R, N, E, U, D, I.

We need to make a third guess.

We know the word has at least two distinct letters: A and O, and possibly others.

We have tested the following letters: C, R, A, N, E, U, D, I, O. And we know A and O are present (A at position 1, O present but not at position 5).

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: S, T, L, M, P, etc.

We also know that in the secret word, O is not at position 5. So O must be at one of positions 2, 3, or 4.

We can try to find a word that:
- Starts with A (since we know position 1 is A).
- Contains O in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- Uses other available letters that are common and we haven't tested.

Possible words:

We might try to put O at position 2: e.g., ""A_O _ _""

But note: if we put O at position 2, and the secret word has O at position 2, we would get a check. If not, but O is present, we get a dash.

Similarly, we can try positions 3 or 4.

We also want to test other new letters.

Let's list some candidate words:

- Option: ""ABOUT"" -> but wait, we know U is absent? And also, we have to start with A. ""ABOUT"" doesn't start with A. So invalid.

- ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T -> starts with A. Has O at position 3. And tests L, F, T.
  - But we don't know if F, T, L are present or not.

However, we must avoid using known absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I.

""ALOFT"" is clean: A, L, O, F, T.

Similarly, ""ALOUD"" -> but D is absent? We know D is absent, so we cannot use D. So ""ALOUD"" is invalid.

""ABORT"" -> but R is absent? R is in the absent list. So no.

""AFOOT"" -> A, F, O, O, T. But has two O's. We don't know if the word has two O's. Also, tests F and T.

But ""AFOOT"" means having to do with feet, and it's a valid word.

But note: O is present, and we put it at position 3 and 4. Since we know O is present but not at position 5, positions 3 and 4 are allowed.

Another option: ""ASTOP"" -> but that might not be a common word. And we know S? We haven't tested S.

But perhaps ""ALOFT"" is better.

Another word: ""ALLOT"" -> A, L, L, O, T. Has double L. And O at position 4.

But we don't know about L or T.

Perhaps we can choose a word that doesn't repeat letters to get more information.

But ""ALOFT"" has distinct letters except for the position? A, L, O, F, T are distinct? Yes, all distinct.

Similarly, ""ATOP"" is only 4 letters? Wait, 5-letter word. ""ATOPY"" but that's medical and uncommon.

Another word: ""ABOIL"" -> not common.

I think ""ALOFT"" is a good candidate because:
- It starts with A (which we know is correct, so we'll get a check on A).
- It has O at position 3 (so we can see if O is at position 3 or not).
- It introduces new common letters: L, F, T.

But note: the word ""ALOFT"" means airborne? It's valid.

Alternatively, we can put O at position 2: words like ""AORTA"" or ""AORTAL"" (too long). ""AORTA"" is 5 letters: A, O, R, T, A. But R is absent? We know R is absent. So ""AORTA"" has R -> invalid because R is absent.

""AVOID"" -> but we know D is absent? And also I is absent? So ""AVOID"" has D and I -> both absent -> invalid.

""AVOW"" -> 4 letters.

So not many with O at position 2.

Now, O at position 4: words like ""ADOBE"" -> but D and E are absent? E is absent and D is absent. So ""ADOBE"" is invalid.

""AGONE"" -> but G, O, N, E? But N and E are absent? N is absent, E is absent -> invalid.

So perhaps position 3 or 4 are more feasible.

Another word: ""ATOLL"" -> A, T, O, L, L. Has O at position 3. But uses L twice? And tests T, O, L.

Or ""APTLY"" -> A, P, T, L, Y. But that doesn't have O? We know O must be in the word. So if we don't include O, we won't get information about its position.

We must include O in our guess because we know it's present and we need to find its position.

So any guess must include O (and avoid absent letters).

So back to ""ALOFT"": it has O at position 3.

Another option: ""ASCOT"" -> A, S, C, O, T. But C is absent? We know C is absent. So invalid.

""ASKOI"" -> not common.

""ALLOW"" -> but W? And O at position 4? Also, we have double L. But ""ALLOW"" doesn't start with A? It starts with A? A L L O W -> yes, starts with A. But has O at position 4.

But we must avoid C,R,N,E,U,D,I -> ""ALLOW"" uses A,L,L,O,W -> all allowed? Yes, L and W are new.

Wait, we haven't tested W. So ""ALLOW"" is a candidate: A, L, L, O, W.

Similarly, ""ALLOT"": A, L, L, O, T.

But what information do we get from double letters? If the secret word has only one L, then one of the L's might be marked as absent? Or both might be marked as dash if there are two L's? It's tricky.

To avoid complexity, maybe choose a word with distinct letters.

""ALOFT"": distinct letters A, L, O, F, T.

""ALOFT"" and ""ALLOW"" are both candidates.

But ""ALLOW"" has double L, so it takes two letter slots for L. If the secret word has one L, we might waste one slot.

Similarly, ""AFOOT"" has double O.

We know O is present, so we can use one O? But if we use two, we can test if there is more than one O.

But since we are early, we can stick to distinct letters.

So I'll go with ""ALOFT"".

But wait: we have tested A in position 1 (known) and O in position 3 (unknown). We also test L, F, T.

Alternatively, we can put O in a different position? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""ATOMS"" -> A, T, O, M, S. O at position 3. Tests T, O, M, S.

But ""ATOMS"" is a valid word. And all letters distinct? Yes: A, T, O, M, S.

Similarly, ""ATOMY"" -> not as common.

Or ""AVOWS"" -> but O is at position 3? And V, O, W, S? And we test V, W, S. But ""AVOWS"" starts with A.

But ""ATOMS"" is a very common word.

Compare ""ATOMS"" and ""ALOFT"":
- Both start with A.
- Both have O at position 3.
- ""ATOMS"" tests T, O, M, S (and we know A and O are present, so we are testing T, M, S).
- ""ALOFT"" tests L, O, F, T.

We haven't tested either set. Both are fine.

Since S and T are very common in English, I'll go with ""ATOMS"" because it includes S and T.

But note: in the first guess, we had C and S? No, in ""crane"" we had C (absent), not S.

S hasn't been tested yet. Similarly, T hasn't been tested.

So ""ATOMS"": A (known at position 1), T (new), O (known present), M (new), S (new).

This way we test three new letters: T, M, S.

We know that O is present and not at position 5, but we put it at position 3? So if O is actually at position 3, we get a check. If it's at position 2 or 4, we get a dash for O at position 3? And then we will know O is not at 3.

Similarly, if we put O at position 3 and it's not in the word? But we know O is present, so it will be either check or dash.

So let's choose ""ATOMS"".

But we must make sure that the word does not contain any absent letters? It doesn't: A, T, O, M, S — none of C,R,N,E,U,D,I.

So ""ATOMS"" is valid.

Therefore, my third guess is ""ATOMS"".

</think>
Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:  
- **Guess 1:** ""crane"" → `C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)`  
  - `C`, `R`, `N`, `E` are **absent**.  
  - `A` is **present** but **not in position 3** (since the feedback was `-` for position 3).  

- **Guess 2:** ""audio"" → `A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)`  
  - `A` is **correct at position 1** (✓).  
  - `U`, `D`, `I` are **absent**.  
  - `O` is **present** but **not in position 5** (since the feedback was `-` for position 5).  

### Key Information:  
1. The secret word **starts with `A`** (position 1).  
2. `O` is in the word but **not at position 5**.  
3. Absent letters: `C`, `R`, `N`, `E`, `U`, `D`, `I` (cannot be used).  
4. Present letters: `A` and `O` (must be included, with `A` fixed at position 1).  
5. Untested letters: Common consonants like `S`, `T`, `L`, `M`, `P`, etc.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:  
- The word must start with `A` and include `O` (not at position 5).  
- To locate `O`, test it in **position 3** (since position 1 is taken by `A`, and position 5 is ruled out; positions 2 or 4 are also possible but position 3 is untested).  
- Prioritize testing high-frequency letters (`S`, `T`, `M`) to gather more information.  
- Avoid reused or absent letters (`C`, `R`, `N`, `E`, `U`, `D`, `I`).  
- Choose a valid 5-letter word: **""ATOMS""** fits because:  
  - Starts with `A` (position 1).  
  - Places `O` at position 3 (to check if correct or misplaced).  
  - Introduces new common letters: `T` (position 2), `M` (position 4), `S` (position 5).  
  - No duplicate or absent letters, maximizing information potential.  

<guess>atoms</guess>",atoms,"We are given feedback for two guesses.
First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Second guess: ""audio"" -> Feedback: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)

From first guess:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not at position 3 (from crane, A was at position 3).

From second guess: ""audio""
- A: ✓ -> This means that A is in the secret word and at position 1. So the secret word starts with A.
- U: x -> U is not in the word.
- D: x -> D is not in the word.
- I: x -> I is not in the word.
- O: - -> O is in the word but not at position 5 (since in audio, O was at position 5).

So we now know:
- The secret word starts with A (position 1 is A).
- A is also not at position 3 (from first guess) but we now know it's at position 1.
- O is in the word, but not at position 5.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I (from both guesses).

Also, from the first guess, we know A is not at position 3, but now we have A fixed at position 1.

Therefore, the secret word is: A _ _ _ _

Where:
- The first letter is A.
- The word contains O (but not at position 5).
- Does not contain: C, R, N, E, U, D, I.

We need to make a third guess.

We know the word has at least two distinct letters: A and O, and possibly others.

We have tested the following letters: C, R, A, N, E, U, D, I, O. And we know A and O are present (A at position 1, O present but not at position 5).

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: S, T, L, M, P, etc.

We also know that in the secret word, O is not at position 5. So O must be at one of positions 2, 3, or 4.

We can try to find a word that:
- Starts with A (since we know position 1 is A).
- Contains O in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- Uses other available letters that are common and we haven't tested.

Possible words:

We might try to put O at position 2: e.g., ""A_O _ _""

But note: if we put O at position 2, and the secret word has O at position 2, we would get a check. If not, but O is present, we get a dash.

Similarly, we can try positions 3 or 4.

We also want to test other new letters.

Let's list some candidate words:

- Option: ""ABOUT"" -> but wait, we know U is absent? And also, we have to start with A. ""ABOUT"" doesn't start with A. So invalid.

- ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T -> starts with A. Has O at position 3. And tests L, F, T.
  - But we don't know if F, T, L are present or not.

However, we must avoid using known absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I.

""ALOFT"" is clean: A, L, O, F, T.

Similarly, ""ALOUD"" -> but D is absent? We know D is absent, so we cannot use D. So ""ALOUD"" is invalid.

""ABORT"" -> but R is absent? R is in the absent list. So no.

""AFOOT"" -> A, F, O, O, T. But has two O's. We don't know if the word has two O's. Also, tests F and T.

But ""AFOOT"" means having to do with feet, and it's a valid word.

But note: O is present, and we put it at position 3 and 4. Since we know O is present but not at position 5, positions 3 and 4 are allowed.

Another option: ""ASTOP"" -> but that might not be a common word. And we know S? We haven't tested S.

But perhaps ""ALOFT"" is better.

Another word: ""ALLOT"" -> A, L, L, O, T. Has double L. And O at position 4.

But we don't know about L or T.

Perhaps we can choose a word that doesn't repeat letters to get more information.

But ""ALOFT"" has distinct letters except for the position? A, L, O, F, T are distinct? Yes, all distinct.

Similarly, ""ATOP"" is only 4 letters? Wait, 5-letter word. ""ATOPY"" but that's medical and uncommon.

Another word: ""ABOIL"" -> not common.

I think ""ALOFT"" is a good candidate because:
- It starts with A (which we know is correct, so we'll get a check on A).
- It has O at position 3 (so we can see if O is at position 3 or not).
- It introduces new common letters: L, F, T.

But note: the word ""ALOFT"" means airborne? It's valid.

Alternatively, we can put O at position 2: words like ""AORTA"" or ""AORTAL"" (too long). ""AORTA"" is 5 letters: A, O, R, T, A. But R is absent? We know R is absent. So ""AORTA"" has R -> invalid because R is absent.

""AVOID"" -> but we know D is absent? And also I is absent? So ""AVOID"" has D and I -> both absent -> invalid.

""AVOW"" -> 4 letters.

So not many with O at position 2.

Now, O at position 4: words like ""ADOBE"" -> but D and E are absent? E is absent and D is absent. So ""ADOBE"" is invalid.

""AGONE"" -> but G, O, N, E? But N and E are absent? N is absent, E is absent -> invalid.

So perhaps position 3 or 4 are more feasible.

Another word: ""ATOLL"" -> A, T, O, L, L. Has O at position 3. But uses L twice? And tests T, O, L.

Or ""APTLY"" -> A, P, T, L, Y. But that doesn't have O? We know O must be in the word. So if we don't include O, we won't get information about its position.

We must include O in our guess because we know it's present and we need to find its position.

So any guess must include O (and avoid absent letters).

So back to ""ALOFT"": it has O at position 3.

Another option: ""ASCOT"" -> A, S, C, O, T. But C is absent? We know C is absent. So invalid.

""ASKOI"" -> not common.

""ALLOW"" -> but W? And O at position 4? Also, we have double L. But ""ALLOW"" doesn't start with A? It starts with A? A L L O W -> yes, starts with A. But has O at position 4.

But we must avoid C,R,N,E,U,D,I -> ""ALLOW"" uses A,L,L,O,W -> all allowed? Yes, L and W are new.

Wait, we haven't tested W. So ""ALLOW"" is a candidate: A, L, L, O, W.

Similarly, ""ALLOT"": A, L, L, O, T.

But what information do we get from double letters? If the secret word has only one L, then one of the L's might be marked as absent? Or both might be marked as dash if there are two L's? It's tricky.

But ""ALLOW"" has double L, so it takes two letter slots for L. If the secret word has one L, we might waste one slot.

Similarly, ""AFOOT"" has double O.

We know O is present, so we can use one O? But if we use two, we can test if there is more than one O.

But since we are early, we can stick to distinct letters.

So I'll go with ""ALOFT"".

But wait: we have tested A in position 1 (known) and O in position 3 (unknown). We also test L, F, T.

Alternatively, we can put O in a different position? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""ATOMS"" -> A, T, O, M, S. O at position 3. Tests T, O, M, S.

But ""ATOMS"" is a valid word. And all letters distinct? Yes: A, T, O, M, S.

Similarly, ""ATOMY"" -> not as common.

Or ""AVOWS"" -> but O is at position 3? And V, O, W, S? And we test V, W, S. But ""AVOWS"" starts with A.

But ""ATOMS"" is a very common word.

Compare ""ATOMS"" and ""ALOFT"":
- Both start with A.
- Both have O at position 3.
- ""ATOMS"" tests T, O, M, S (and we know A and O are present, so we are testing T, M, S).
- ""ALOFT"" tests L, O, F, T.

We haven't tested either set. Both are fine.

Since S and T are very common in English, I'll go with ""ATOMS"" because it includes S and T.

But note: in the first guess, we had C and S? No, in ""crane"" we had C (absent), not S.

S hasn't been tested yet. Similarly, T hasn't been tested.

So ""ATOMS"": A (known at position 1), T (new), O (known present), M (new), S (new).

This way we test three new letters: T, M, S.

We know that O is present and not at position 5, but we put it at position 3? So if O is actually at position 3, we get a check. If it's at position 2 or 4, we get a dash for O at position 3? And then we will know O is not at 3.

Similarly, if we put O at position 3 and it's not in the word? But we know O is present, so it will be either check or dash.

So let's choose ""ATOMS"".

But we must make sure that the word does not contain any absent letters? It doesn't: A, T, O, M, S — none of C,R,N,E,U,D,I.

So ""ATOMS"" is valid.

Therefore, my third guess is ""ATOMS"".

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the secret word)
 R: x (not in the secret word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the secret word)
 E: x (not in the secret word)

 So, from this we know:
 - The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess at position 3 and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' (but not at position 3) and does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we know the secret word has 5 letters and must include 'A', we can try to think of words that have 'A' in them, but not in the third position, and without the letters C, R, N, E.

 Also, note that the first guess was ""crane"", so we have eliminated those letters.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Is a valid 5-letter English word.
 - Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 - Contains the letter 'A', but not at position 3 (because in ""crane"", 'A' was at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position).

 However, note that the feedback for 'A' being present but not at position 3 does not necessarily mean it cannot be at position 3 in the secret word? Actually, wait: in the feedback, the '-' for 'A' means that the letter is in the word but not at that position. So the secret word has an 'A' but not at position 3.

 But note: the secret word might have more than one 'A'. However, we don't know that yet.

 We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test more common letters.

 Since we have eliminated C, R, N, E, we can try to use other common letters.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

 We also know that the word must contain an 'A'. So let's think of words that have an 'A' and avoid C, R, N, E.

 Also, we don't know the position of 'A', so we can try to put it in a different position.

 Let's try to choose a word that has:
 - 'A' in a position that is not 3 (so positions 1,2,4,5) and also includes other common letters that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SALAD"", but note that we have to avoid the letters we know are absent. However, in ""SALAD"", we have:
   S, A, L, A, D.

 But wait: we have two A's. That's acceptable because we don't know if the secret word has two A's.

 However, we must avoid R, N, E, C? Yes, and R, N, E, C are not in ""SALAD"". So it's a candidate.

 But let's see: we want to maximize information. We know that the word has at least one 'A'. If we use two A's, we might get information about whether there are two A's.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with only one 'A' and other new letters.

 Another idea: since we know the word has an 'A', we can try to put the 'A' in a different position to narrow down.

 In the first guess, 'A' was at position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let me think of common words:

 Option 1: ""AUDIO"" -> but that has A at position 1, and also U, D, I, O. But note: we haven't tested U, D, I, O. However, we must avoid R, N, E, C? Yes, and AUDIO doesn't have those. But wait, we also know that R is absent? Yes, from the first feedback R was marked as absent. So AUDIO is acceptable.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word has an 'A' and we are putting it at position 1. If the secret word has the 'A' at position 1, then we would get a check (✓) for the first letter. If not, then we get a dash (-) meaning it's in the word but not at 1. Also, we get to test U, D, I, O.

 However, we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess said that 'A' is in the word but not at position 3. It could be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Another option: ""PASTA"" -> but that has P, A, S, T, A. Again, no R, N, E, C. And we test P, S, T.

 But note: we have two A's again.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has the 'A' in position 2, for example: ""SAULT"" (but SAULT is not very common, and we might prefer more common words).

 Another common word: ""SLATE"" -> but wait, we know E is absent (from first feedback: E was marked as absent). So we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use R, N, C.

 So we must avoid E, R, N, C.

 Let me list some words that have an 'A' and avoid E, R, N, C:

 - SALAD: S, A, L, A, D -> positions: S1, A2, L3, A4, D5 -> we have A at 2 and 4.
 - PASTA: P1, A2, S3, T4, A5 -> A at 2 and 5.
 - PASTY: but Y is not very common and also we have to avoid E? Pastry has R? No, PASTY is P,A,S,T,Y -> but we don't know about Y. However, it's a valid word.
 - PLAIT: but has L, A, I, T? and P. But note: we don't know about P, L, I, T. However, it has an 'A' at position 3? But wait, we are not supposed to put 'A' at position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3 again? But the feedback said that the secret word has an 'A' but not at position 3. So if we put an 'A' at position 3 and it is the same as the secret word's 'A'? Actually, no: because the secret word's 'A' is not at position 3. So if we put an 'A' at position 3 and the secret word has only one 'A', then we would get an 'x' for that. But if the secret word has two A's, one of which is at position 3? But wait, the feedback for the first guess said that the 'A' at position 3 is present but in the wrong position? That would be contradictory because if the secret word has an 'A' at position 3, then the first guess would have gotten a check (✓) for the 'A' at position 3? But it didn't, it got a dash (-). So the secret word does not have an 'A' at position 3. Therefore, if we put an 'A' at position 3 in our new guess, we would get an 'x' for that position (if the secret word has only one 'A') or a dash for that position if the secret word has another 'A' that is not at position 3? Actually, no: the dash means that the letter is in the word but not at that position. So if we put an 'A' at position 3 and the secret word has an 'A' but not at position 3 (and also not at that same position in the secret word) then we would get a dash? But wait, the feedback is per letter occurrence. If the secret word has two A's, and we have two A's in our guess, then each A in the guess is evaluated independently.

 However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to avoid putting the 'A' at position 3 again because we know it's not there. We can put it in a different position to test.

 So let's choose a word that has an 'A' in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and also includes other common letters we haven't tried.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:
 - It has A at position 1 (so we test if the secret word has A at position 1).
 - It has U, D, I, O which are common and we haven't tested.

 But note: the secret word might not have any of these, but we are trying to get information.

 However, we must consider that the secret word has at least one 'A'. So if we put 'A' at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash meaning it's in the word but not at 1. Then we also test U, D, I, O.

 But wait: what if the secret word has two A's? Then we might get a dash for the first A and then we don't have another A in the word to test? So we wouldn't know about the second A. But that's okay because we are still in the early stage.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has only one 'A' and in a new position, and also includes other common letters.

 Another common word: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. The 'A' is at position 3? But we are avoiding position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3? But we know the secret word does not have an 'A' at position 3. So if we put an 'A' at position 3, we expect it to be marked as absent (if the secret word has only one 'A') or as present but wrong position (if there is a second 'A' elsewhere). But that might be confusing. So to avoid that, let's not put the 'A' at position 3.

 In ""STAMP"", the 'A' is at position 3. So we avoid that.

 How about ""PASTA""? It has two A's: one at position 2 and one at position 5. We avoid position 3. So we can use that.

 But let me check: P, A, S, T, A. We haven't tested P, S, T. And we avoid R, N, E, C.

 So ""PASTA"" is a valid word.

 Another option: ""SAULT"" (which is a word, meaning a leap or a jump, but not very common). Or ""SALTY"", but we know E is absent? SALTY has T and Y, but we don't know about T and Y. However, we also have to avoid E? Yes, and SALTY doesn't have E.

 But I think ""PASTA"" is more common.

 Alternatively, ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> has A at position 2. And we test D, I, L, Y.

 But note: we don't know about D, I, L, Y.

 However, we are trying to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, etc.

 In ""PASTA"": we test P, A, S, T, A -> so we test P, S, T and two A's.

 In ""AUDIO"": we test A, U, D, I, O.

 Which one gives more information? Both are good.

 But note: we already know that the word has an 'A'. So testing two A's in ""PASTA"" might be less efficient if the word has only one A. But if it has two, then we get more information.

 However, I think I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests more vowels and we haven't tested any vowels except A (and we know E is absent). So we can test U, I, O.

 But wait: the first guess had A and E? And we know E is absent. So we have only tested A and E? And E is absent. So we have not tested any other vowels? So testing U, I, O is good.

 Also, we are putting A at position 1.

 So let's choose ""AUDIO"".

 But note: the word must be in the word list. I believe ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""AUDIO"".

<guess>audio</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.
- A is **present** but **not in position 3**.

For the second guess:
- Must include **A** (in a position other than 3) and avoid C, R, N, E.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, U, D, I) to maximize information.
- ""AUDIO"" is chosen because:
  - Places A in position 1 (testing if A is correctly placed there).
  - Introduces new common letters U, D, I, O (vowels and consonants not yet tested).
  - Avoids reused letters (C, R, N, E) and covers multiple positions.

<guess>audio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses.
First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Second guess: ""audio"" -> Feedback: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)

From first guess:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not at position 3 (from crane, A was at position 3).

From second guess: ""audio""
- A: ✓ -> This means that A is in the secret word and at position 1. So the secret word starts with A.
- U: x -> U is not in the word.
- D: x -> D is not in the word.
- I: x -> I is not in the word.
- O: - -> O is in the word but not at position 5 (since in audio, O was at position 5).

So we now know:
- The secret word starts with A (position 1 is A).
- A is also not at position 3 (from first guess) but we now know it's at position 1.
- O is in the word, but not at position 5.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I (from both guesses).

Also, from the first guess, we know A is not at position 3, but now we have A fixed at position 1.

Therefore, the secret word is: A _ _ _ _

Where:
- The first letter is A.
- The word contains O (but not at position 5).
- Does not contain: C, R, N, E, U, D, I.

We need to make a third guess.

We know the word has at least two distinct letters: A and O, and possibly others.

We have tested the following letters: C, R, A, N, E, U, D, I, O. And we know A and O are present (A at position 1, O present but not at position 5).

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: S, T, L, M, P, etc.

We also know that in the secret word, O is not at position 5. So O must be at one of positions 2, 3, or 4.

We can try to find a word that:
- Starts with A (since we know position 1 is A).
- Contains O in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- Uses other available letters that are common and we haven't tested.

Possible words:

We might try to put O at position 2: e.g., ""A_O _ _""

But note: if we put O at position 2, and the secret word has O at position 2, we would get a check. If not, but O is present, we get a dash.

Similarly, we can try positions 3 or 4.

We also want to test other new letters.

Let's list some candidate words:

- Option: ""ABOUT"" -> but wait, we know U is absent? And also, we have to start with A. ""ABOUT"" doesn't start with A. So invalid.

- ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T -> starts with A. Has O at position 3. And tests L, F, T.
  - But we don't know if F, T, L are present or not.

However, we must avoid using known absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I.

""ALOFT"" is clean: A, L, O, F, T.

Similarly, ""ALOUD"" -> but D is absent? We know D is absent, so we cannot use D. So ""ALOUD"" is invalid.

""ABORT"" -> but R is absent? R is in the absent list. So no.

""AFOOT"" -> A, F, O, O, T. But has two O's. We don't know if the word has two O's. Also, tests F and T.

But ""AFOOT"" means having to do with feet, and it's a valid word.

But note: O is present, and we put it at position 3 and 4. Since we know O is present but not at position 5, positions 3 and 4 are allowed.

Another option: ""ASTOP"" -> but that might not be a common word. And we know S? We haven't tested S.

But perhaps ""ALOFT"" is better.

Another word: ""ALLOT"" -> A, L, L, O, T. Has double L. And O at position 4.

But we don't know about L or T.

Perhaps we can choose a word that doesn't repeat letters to get more information.

But ""ALOFT"" has distinct letters except for the position? A, L, O, F, T are distinct? Yes, all distinct.

Similarly, ""ATOP"" is only 4 letters? Wait, 5-letter word. ""ATOPY"" but that's medical and uncommon.

Another word: ""ABOIL"" -> not common.

I think ""ALOFT"" is a good candidate because:
- It starts with A (which we know is correct, so we'll get a check on A).
- It has O at position 3 (so we can see if O is at position 3 or not).
- It introduces new common letters: L, F, T.

But note: the word ""ALOFT"" means airborne? It's valid.

Alternatively, we can put O at position 2: words like ""AORTA"" or ""AORTAL"" (too long). ""AORTA"" is 5 letters: A, O, R, T, A. But R is absent? We know R is absent. So ""AORTA"" has R -> invalid because R is absent.

""AVOID"" -> but we know D is absent? And also I is absent? So ""AVOID"" has D and I -> both absent -> invalid.

""AVOW"" -> 4 letters.

So not many with O at position 2.

Now, O at position 4: words like ""ADOBE"" -> but D and E are absent? E is absent and D is absent. So ""ADOBE"" is invalid.

""AGONE"" -> but G, O, N, E? But N and E are absent? N is absent, E is absent -> invalid.

So perhaps position 3 or 4 are more feasible.

Another word: ""ATOLL"" -> A, T, O, L, L. Has O at position 3. But uses L twice? And tests T, O, L.

Or ""APTLY"" -> A, P, T, L, Y. But that doesn't have O? We know O must be in the word. So if we don't include O, we won't get information about its position.

We must include O in our guess because we know it's present and we need to find its position.

So any guess must include O (and avoid absent letters).

So back to ""ALOFT"": it has O at position 3.

Another option: ""ASCOT"" -> A, S, C, O, T. But C is absent? We know C is absent. So invalid.

""ASKOI"" -> not common.

""ALLOW"" -> but W? And O at position 4? Also, we have double L. But ""ALLOW"" doesn't start with A? It starts with A? A L L O W -> yes, starts with A. But has O at position 4.

But we must avoid C,R,N,E,U,D,I -> ""ALLOW"" uses A,L,L,O,W -> all allowed? Yes, L and W are new.

Wait, we haven't tested W. So ""ALLOW"" is a candidate: A, L, L, O, W.

Similarly, ""ALLOT"": A, L, L, O, T.

But what information do we get from double letters? If the secret word has only one L, then one of the L's might be marked as absent? Or both might be marked as dash if there are two L's? It's tricky.

To avoid complexity, maybe choose a word with distinct letters.

""ALOFT"": distinct letters A, L, O, F, T.

""ALOFT"" and ""ALLOW"" are both candidates.

But ""ALLOW"" has double L, so it takes two letter slots for L. If the secret word has one L, we might waste one slot.

Similarly, ""AFOOT"" has double O.

We know O is present, so we can use one O? But if we use two, we can test if there is more than one O.

But since we are early, we can stick to distinct letters.

So I'll go with ""ALOFT"".

But wait: we have tested A in position 1 (known) and O in position 3 (unknown). We also test L, F, T.

Alternatively, we can put O in a different position? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""ATOMS"" -> A, T, O, M, S. O at position 3. Tests T, O, M, S.

But ""ATOMS"" is a valid word. And all letters distinct? Yes: A, T, O, M, S.

Similarly, ""ATOMY"" -> not as common.

Or ""AVOWS"" -> but O is at position 3? And V, O, W, S? And we test V, W, S. But ""AVOWS"" starts with A.

But ""ATOMS"" is a very common word.

Compare ""ATOMS"" and ""ALOFT"":
- Both start with A.
- Both have O at position 3.
- ""ATOMS"" tests T, O, M, S (and we know A and O are present, so we are testing T, M, S).
- ""ALOFT"" tests L, O, F, T.

We haven't tested either set. Both are fine.

Since S and T are very common in English, I'll go with ""ATOMS"" because it includes S and T.

But note: in the first guess, we had C and S? No, in ""crane"" we had C (absent), not S.

S hasn't been tested yet. Similarly, T hasn't been tested.

So ""ATOMS"": A (known at position 1), T (new), O (known present), M (new), S (new).

This way we test three new letters: T, M, S.

We know that O is present and not at position 5, but we put it at position 3? So if O is actually at position 3, we get a check. If it's at position 2 or 4, we get a dash for O at position 3? And then we will know O is not at 3.

Similarly, if we put O at position 3 and it's not in the word? But we know O is present, so it will be either check or dash.

So let's choose ""ATOMS"".

But we must make sure that the word does not contain any absent letters? It doesn't: A, T, O, M, S — none of C,R,N,E,U,D,I.

So ""ATOMS"" is valid.

Therefore, my third guess is ""ATOMS"".

<guess>atoms</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:  
- **Guess 1:** ""crane"" → `C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)`  
  - `C`, `R`, `N`, `E` are **absent**.  
  - `A` is **present** but **not in position 3** (since the feedback was `-` for position 3).  

- **Guess 2:** ""audio"" → `A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)`  
  - `A` is **correct at position 1** (✓).  
  - `U`, `D`, `I` are **absent**.  
  - `O` is **present** but **not in position 5** (since the feedback was `-` for position 5).  

### Key Information:  
1. The secret word **starts with `A`** (position 1).  
2. `O` is in the word but **not at position 5**.  
3. Absent letters: `C`, `R`, `N`, `E`, `U`, `D`, `I` (cannot be used).  
4. Present letters: `A` and `O` (must be included, with `A` fixed at position 1).  
5. Untested letters: Common consonants like `S`, `T`, `L`, `M`, `P`, etc.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:  
- The word must start with `A` and include `O` (not at position 5).  
- To locate `O`, test it in **position 3** (since position 1 is taken by `A`, and position 5 is ruled out; positions 2 or 4 are also possible but position 3 is untested).  
- Prioritize testing high-frequency letters (`S`, `T`, `M`) to gather more information.  
- Avoid reused or absent letters (`C`, `R`, `N`, `E`, `U`, `D`, `I`).  
- Choose a valid 5-letter word: **""ATOMS""** fits because:  
  - Starts with `A` (position 1).  
  - Places `O` at position 3 (to check if correct or misplaced).  
  - Introduces new common letters: `T` (position 2), `M` (position 4), `S` (position 5).  
  - No duplicate or absent letters, maximizing information potential.

And we test P, S, T.\n\n But note: we have two A\'s again.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has the \'A\' in position 2, for example: ""SAULT"" (but SAULT is not very common, and we might prefer more common words).\n\n Another common word: ""SLATE"" -> but wait, we know E is absent (from first feedback: E was marked as absent). So we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use R, N, C.\n\n So we must avoid E, R, N, C.\n\n Let me list some words that have an \'A\' and avoid E, R, N, C:\n\n - SALAD: S, A, L, A, D -> positions: S1, A2, L3, A4, D5 -> we have A at 2 and 4.\n - PASTA: P1, A2, S3, T4, A5 -> A at 2 and 5.\n - PASTY: but Y is not very common and also we have to avoid E? Pastry has R? No, PASTY is P,A,S,T,Y -> but we don\'t know about Y. However, it\'s a valid word.\n - PLAIT: but has L, A, I, T? and P. But note: we don\'t know about P, L, I, T. However, it has an \'A\' at position 3? But wait, we are not supposed to put \'A\' at position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3 again? But the feedback said that the secret word has an \'A\' but not at position 3. So if we put an \'A\' at position 3 and it is the same as the secret word\'s \'A\'? Actually, no: because the secret word\'s \'A\' is not at position 3. So if we put an \'A\' at position 3 and the secret word has only one \'A\', then we would get an \'x\' for that. But if the secret word has two A\'s, one of which is at position 3? But wait, the feedback for the first guess said that the \'A\' at position 3 is present but in the wrong position? That would be contradictory because if the secret word has an \'A\' at position 3, then the first guess would have gotten a check (✓) for the \'A\' at position 3? But it didn\'t, it got a dash (-). So the secret word does not have an \'A\' at position 3. Therefore, if we put an \'A\' at position 3 in our new guess, we would get an \'x\' for that position (if the secret word has only one \'A\') or a dash for that position if the secret word has another \'A\' that is not at position 3? Actually, no: the dash means that the letter is in the word but not at that position. So if we put an \'A\' at position 3 and the secret word has an \'A\' but not at position 3 (and also not at that same position in the secret word) then we would get a dash? But wait, the feedback is per letter occurrence. If the secret word has two A\'s, and we have two A\'s in our guess, then each A in the guess is evaluated independently.\n\n However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to avoid putting the \'A\' at position 3 again because we know it\'s not there. We can put it in a different position to test.\n\n So let\'s choose a word that has an \'A\' in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and also includes other common letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:\n - It has A at position 1 (so we test if the secret word has A at position 1).\n - It has U, D, I, O which are common and we haven\'t tested.\n\n But note: the secret word might not have any of these, but we are trying to get information.\n\n However, we must consider that the secret word has at least one \'A\'. So if we put \'A\' at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash meaning it\'s in the word but not at 1. Then we also test U, D, I, O.\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has two A\'s? Then we might get a dash for the first A and then we don\'t have another A in the word to test? So we wouldn\'t know about the second A. But that\'s okay because we are still in the early stage.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has only one \'A\' and in a new position, and also includes other common letters.\n\n Another common word: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. The \'A\' is at position 3? But we are avoiding position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3? But we know the secret word does not have an \'A\' at position 3. So if we put an \'A\' at position 3, we expect it to be marked as absent (if the secret word has only one \'A\') or as present but wrong position (if there is a second \'A\' elsewhere). But that might be confusing. So to avoid that, let\'s not put the \'A\' at position 3.\n\n In ""STAMP"", the \'A\' is at position 3. So we avoid that.\n\n How about ""PASTA""? It has two A\'s: one at position 2 and one at position 5. We avoid position 3. So we can use that.\n\n But let me check: P, A, S, T, A. We haven\'t tested P, S, T. And we avoid R, N, E, C.\n\n So ""PASTA"" is a valid word.\n\n Another option: ""SAULT"" (which is a word, meaning a leap or a jump, but not very common). Or ""SALTY"", but we know E is absent? SALTY has T and Y, but we don\'t know about T and Y. However, we also have to avoid E? Yes, and SALTY doesn\'t have E.\n\n But I think ""PASTA"" is more common.\n\n Alternatively, ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> has A at position 2. And we test D, I, L, Y.\n\n But note: we don\'t know about D, I, L, Y.\n\n However, we are trying to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, etc.\n\n In ""PASTA"": we test P, A, S, T, A -> so we test P, S, T and two A\'s.\n\n In ""AUDIO"": we test A, U, D, I, O.\n\n Which one gives more information? Both are good.\n\n But note: we already know that the word has an \'A\'. So testing two A\'s in ""PASTA"" might be less efficient if the word has only one A. But if it has two, then we get more information.\n\n However, I think I\'ll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests more vowels and we haven\'t tested any vowels except A (and we know E is absent). So we can test U, I, O.\n\n But wait: the first guess had A and E? And we know E is absent. So we have only tested A and E? And E is absent. So we have not tested any other vowels? So testing U, I, O is good.\n\n Also, we are putting A at position 1.\n\n So let\'s choose ""AUDIO"".\n\n But note: the word must be in the word list. I believe ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.\n\n Therefore, my second guess is ""AUDIO"".\n\n<guess>audio</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.\n- A is **present** but **not in position 3**.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include **A** (in a position other than 3) and avoid C, R, N, E.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, U, D, I) to maximize information.\n- ""AUDIO"" is chosen because:\n  - Places A in position 1 (testing if A is correctly placed there).\n  - Introduces new common letters U, D, I, O (vowels and consonants not yet tested).\n  - Avoids reused letters (C, R, N, E) and covers multiple positions.\n\n<guess>audio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses.\nFirst guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nSecond guess: ""audio"" -> Feedback: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)\n\nFrom first guess:\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.\n- A is in the word but not at position 3 (from crane, A was at position 3).\n\nFrom second guess: ""audio""\n- A: ✓ -> This means that A is in the secret word and at position 1. So the secret word starts with A.\n- U: x -> U is not in the word.\n- D: x -> D is not in the word.\n- I: x -> I is not in the word.\n- O: - -> O is in the word but not at position 5 (since in audio, O was at position 5).\n\nSo we now know:\n- The secret word starts with A (position 1 is A).\n- A is also not at position 3 (from first guess) but we now know it\'s at position 1.\n- O is in the word, but not at position 5.\n- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I (from both guesses).\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know A is not at position 3, but now we have A fixed at position 1.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is: A _ _ _ _\n\nWhere:\n- The first letter is A.\n- The word contains O (but not at position 5).\n- Does not contain: C, R, N, E, U, D, I.\n\nWe need to make a third guess.\n\nWe know the word has at least two distinct letters: A and O, and possibly others.\n\nWe have tested the following letters: C, R, A, N, E, U, D, I, O. And we know A and O are present (A at position 1, O present but not at position 5).\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, M, P, etc.\n\nWe also know that in the secret word, O is not at position 5. So O must be at one of positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe can try to find a word that:\n- Starts with A (since we know position 1 is A).\n- Contains O in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n- Uses other available letters that are common and we haven\'t tested.\n\nPossible words:\n\nWe might try to put O at position 2: e.g., ""A_O _ _""\n\nBut note: if we put O at position 2, and the secret word has O at position 2, we would get a check. If not, but O is present, we get a dash.\n\nSimilarly, we can try positions 3 or 4.\n\nWe also want to test other new letters.\n\nLet\'s list some candidate words:\n\n- Option: ""ABOUT"" -> but wait, we know U is absent? And also, we have to start with A. ""ABOUT"" doesn\'t start with A. So invalid.\n\n- ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T -> starts with A. Has O at position 3. And tests L, F, T.\n  - But we don\'t know if F, T, L are present or not.\n\nHowever, we must avoid using known absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I.\n\n""ALOFT"" is clean: A, L, O, F, T.\n\nSimilarly, ""ALOUD"" -> but D is absent? We know D is absent, so we cannot use D. So ""ALOUD"" is invalid.\n\n""ABORT"" -> but R is absent? R is in the absent list. So no.\n\n""AFOOT"" -> A, F, O, O, T. But has two O\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two O\'s. Also, tests F and T.\n\nBut ""AFOOT"" means having to do with feet, and it\'s a valid word.\n\nBut note: O is present, and we put it at position 3 and 4. Since we know O is present but not at position 5, positions 3 and 4 are allowed.\n\nAnother option: ""ASTOP"" -> but that might not be a common word. And we know S? We haven\'t tested S.\n\nBut perhaps ""ALOFT"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""ALLOT"" -> A, L, L, O, T. Has double L. And O at position 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know about L or T.\n\nPerhaps we can choose a word that doesn\'t repeat letters to get more information.\n\nBut ""ALOFT"" has distinct letters except for the position? A, L, O, F, T are distinct? Yes, all distinct.\n\nSimilarly, ""ATOP"" is only 4 letters? Wait, 5-letter word. ""ATOPY"" but that\'s medical and uncommon.\n\nAnother word: ""ABOIL"" -> not common.\n\nI think ""ALOFT"" is a good candidate because:\n- It starts with A (which we know is correct, so we\'ll get a check on A).\n- It has O at position 3 (so we can see if O is at position 3 or not).\n- It introduces new common letters: L, F, T.\n\nBut note: the word ""ALOFT"" means airborne? It\'s valid.\n\nAlternatively, we can put O at position 2: words like ""AORTA"" or ""AORTAL"" (too long). ""AORTA"" is 5 letters: A, O, R, T, A. But R is absent? We know R is absent. So ""AORTA"" has R -> invalid because R is absent.\n\n""AVOID"" -> but we know D is absent? And also I is absent? So ""AVOID"" has D and I -> both absent -> invalid.\n\n""AVOW"" -> 4 letters.\n\nSo not many with O at position 2.\n\nNow, O at position 4: words like ""ADOBE"" -> but D and E are absent? E is absent and D is absent. So ""ADOBE"" is invalid.\n\n""AGONE"" -> but G, O, N, E? But N and E are absent? N is absent, E is absent -> invalid.\n\nSo perhaps position 3 or 4 are more feasible.\n\nAnother word: ""ATOLL"" -> A, T, O, L, L. Has O at position 3. But uses L twice? And tests T, O, L.\n\nOr ""APTLY"" -> A, P, T, L, Y. But that doesn\'t have O? We know O must be in the word. So if we don\'t include O, we won\'t get information about its position.\n\nWe must include O in our guess because we know it\'s present and we need to find its position.\n\nSo any guess must include O (and avoid absent letters).\n\nSo back to ""ALOFT"": it has O at position 3.\n\nAnother option: ""ASCOT"" -> A, S, C, O, T. But C is absent? We know C is absent. So invalid.\n\n""ASKOI"" -> not common.\n\n""ALLOW"" -> but W? And O at position 4? Also, we have double L. But ""ALLOW"" doesn\'t start with A? It starts with A? A L L O W -> yes, starts with A. But has O at position 4.\n\nBut we must avoid C,R,N,E,U,D,I -> ""ALLOW"" uses A,L,L,O,W -> all allowed? Yes, L and W are new.\n\nWait, we haven\'t tested W. So ""ALLOW"" is a candidate: A, L, L, O, W.\n\nSimilarly, ""ALLOT"": A, L, L, O, T.\n\nBut what information do we get from double letters? If the secret word has only one L, then one of the L\'s might be marked as absent? Or both might be marked as dash if there are two L\'s? It\'s tricky.\n\nTo avoid complexity, maybe choose a word with distinct letters.\n\n""ALOFT"": distinct letters A, L, O, F, T.\n\n""ALOFT"" and ""ALLOW"" are both candidates.\n\nBut ""ALLOW"" has double L, so it takes two letter slots for L. If the secret word has one L, we might waste one slot.\n\nSimilarly, ""AFOOT"" has double O.\n\nWe know O is present, so we can use one O? But if we use two, we can test if there is more than one O.\n\nBut since we are early, we can stick to distinct letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ALOFT"".\n\nBut wait: we have tested A in position 1 (known) and O in position 3 (unknown). We also test L, F, T.\n\nAlternatively, we can put O in a different position? But we don\'t have many options.\n\nAnother word: ""ATOMS"" -> A, T, O, M, S. O at position 3. Tests T, O, M, S.\n\nBut ""ATOMS"" is a valid word. And all letters distinct? Yes: A, T, O, M, S.\n\nSimilarly, ""ATOMY"" -> not as common.\n\nOr ""AVOWS"" -> but O is at position 3? And V, O, W, S? And we test V, W, S. But ""AVOWS"" starts with A.\n\nBut ""ATOMS"" is a very common word.\n\nCompare ""ATOMS"" and ""ALOFT"":\n- Both start with A.\n- Both have O at position 3.\n- ""ATOMS"" tests T, O, M, S (and we know A and O are present, so we are testing T, M, S).\n- ""ALOFT"" tests L, O, F, T.\n\nWe haven\'t tested either set. Both are fine.\n\nSince S and T are very common in English, I\'ll go with ""ATOMS"" because it includes S and T.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had C and S? No, in ""crane"" we had C (absent), not S.\n\nS hasn\'t been tested yet. Similarly, T hasn\'t been tested.\n\nSo ""ATOMS"": A (known at position 1), T (new), O (known present), M (new), S (new).\n\nThis way we test three new letters: T, M, S.\n\nWe know that O is present and not at position 5, but we put it at position 3? So if O is actually at position 3, we get a check. If it\'s at position 2 or 4, we get a dash for O at position 3? And then we will know O is not at 3.\n\nSimilarly, if we put O at position 3 and it\'s not in the word? But we know O is present, so it will be either check or dash.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""ATOMS"".\n\nBut we must make sure that the word does not contain any absent letters? It doesn\'t: A, T, O, M, S — none of C,R,N,E,U,D,I.\n\nSo ""ATOMS"" is valid.\n\nTherefore, my third guess is ""ATOMS"".\n\n<guess>atoms</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:  \n- **Guess 1:** ""crane"" → `C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)`  \n  - `C`, `R`, `N`, `E` are **absent**.  \n  - `A` is **present** but **not in position 3** (since the feedback was `-` for position 3).  \n\n- **Guess 2:** ""audio"" → `A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)`  \n  - `A` is **correct at position 1** (✓).  \n  - `U`, `D`, `I` are **absent**.  \n  - `O` is **present** but **not in position 5** (since the feedback was `-` for position 5).  \n\n### Key Information:  \n1.

We have the following feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present but wrong position (-) [position 3]
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: ""audio""
- A: correct position (✓) [position 1]
- U: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- O: present but wrong position (-) [position 5]

Guess 3: ""atoms""
- A: correct position (✓) [position 1]
- T: absent (x)
- O: present but wrong position (-) [position 3]
- M: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word starts with 'A' (since ""audio"" had A correct at position 1 and ""atoms"" confirmed it).
2. The letter 'O' is present in the word, but not at position 3 (from ""atoms"") and not at position 5 (from ""audio""). Therefore, 'O' must be at position 2 or 4.
3. Absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, T, M, S. (All marked as absent in the feedbacks)
4. Present letters: A (position 1) and O (position 2 or 4).

We have used the following letters: A, C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, T, M, S. The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, T, M, S.

The only present letters we know are A and O. Since we have two positions left (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) and we know O is in one of 2 or 4, and the other positions must be filled with letters we haven't tried yet.

We need to consider the remaining letters of the alphabet that haven't been tested: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, and we have A at position 1 and O at either 2 or 4.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: O is at position 2.
Then the word is: A O _ _ _

Case 2: O is at position 4.
Then the word is: A _ _ O _

We need to choose a word that includes O in either position 2 or 4 and uses new letters from the remaining set.

We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters from the remaining: L, P, H, G, B, F, etc.

We can try to form a word that has O in position 2 and then test other common letters, or in position 4.

But we don't know which case, so we might choose a word that has O in position 4 to test that possibility, since we haven't tested position 4 for O yet? Actually, we haven't tested position 2 or 4 directly.

In ""audio"", O was at position 5 (wrong) and in ""atoms"", O was at position 3 (wrong). So positions 2 and 4 are still possible.

We can try a word with O at position 4 to see if it is correct there.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has O at position 2 to test that.

But we also need to test other letters.

Let's list possible words that start with A, have O in position 2 or 4, and use only the available letters.

First, with O at position 2: A O _ _ _

We need to fill the last three positions with letters from B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, avoiding the absent letters.

Possible words: 
- A O L L Y (ALLY) -> but that has double L? ""ALLY"" is 4 letters? ""ALLOY"" is 5 letters: A L L O Y -> but that has O at position 4, not 2.

For position 2: 
- ""AORTA"" -> but R and T are absent? R and T are absent, so invalid.
- ""AOKAY"" -> not a word.
- ""ABOUT"" -> U is absent.
- ""ADOBE"" -> D and E absent.

It's hard to find a common word with O at position 2 without using absent letters.

Now, with O at position 4: A _ _ O _

Possible words:
- ""ALBOW"" -> not common, but ""ELBOW"" is common but doesn't start with A.
- ""ALLOW"" -> A L L O W -> but we have double L? And we haven't tested L or W. But note: we have to avoid absent letters. L and W are not in the absent list. So ""ALLOW"" is a candidate.

But ""ALLOW"" has O at position 4? Let's see: 
Position 1: A
Position 2: L
Position 3: L
Position 4: O
Position 5: W

So O is at position 4.

Another word: ""ARROW"" -> but R is absent, and also double R? and O at position 4? But R absent.

""APTLY"" -> A P T L Y -> but T is absent? T was marked absent in ""atoms"", so we cannot use T.

""ABHOR"" -> R absent.

""ALOHA"" -> A L O H A -> but O is at position 3? We need O at position 4? Actually, ""ALOHA"": A (1), L (2), O (3), H (4), A (5). So O is at position 3, which we already know is wrong (from ""atoms"", O not at 3). So we cannot use that.

We need O at position 4.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" -> not common and O not present.

""ALGAE"" -> E absent.

""ALIBI"" -> I absent.

""ALKYL"" -> not common.

""ALWAY"" -> not a word, but ""ALWAYS"" is 6 letters.

""ALOW"" is not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""ALLOW"" is the best candidate so far.

Another word: ""AVOW"" -> 4 letters.

""AVOWS"" -> A V O W S -> but S is absent? S was marked absent in ""atoms"", so we cannot use S.

Similarly, ""ATOMS"" had S at position 5 and it was absent.

So we cannot use S.

Therefore, ""ALLOW"" is a candidate: A, L, L, O, W.

But it has double L. That might be acceptable.

Another word: ""ALLOT"" -> A L L O T -> but T is absent? T was absent in ""atoms"", so we cannot use T.

So ""ALLOT"" is invalid.

""ALLOY"" -> A L L O Y -> O is at position 4? Yes: A(1), L(2), L(3), O(4), Y(5). And we haven't tested L or Y. And Y is allowed.

But ""ALLOY"" has double L. We can use it to test L and Y.

Another word: ""ALOOF"" -> A L O O F -> O at position 3? We need position 4. ""ALOOF"": A(1), L(2), O(3), O(4), F(5). So O is at both 3 and 4. But we know O is not at position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback: O at position 3 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning it is not at 3). So if we put O at position 3, we expect it to be marked as absent (if only one O) or as present but wrong position if there is another O? But we know the secret word has at least one O, but we don't know if it has two.

However, we are trying to avoid position 3 for O because we know it's not there. So putting O at position 3 might not be efficient.

But in ""ALOOF"", we have O at position 3 and 4. We know position 3 is wrong, so that O will be marked as absent (if only one O) or as present but wrong position (if there is a second O). But we are more interested in position 4.

Alternatively, we can choose a word without O at position 3.

So ""ALLOY"" is better: O at position 4.

Similarly, ""ALLOW"" has O at position 4.

But ""ALLOW"" uses W, and ""ALLOY"" uses Y.

Both are valid.

We can also consider ""ALBUM"" -> but U and M are absent? U and M are absent (from ""audio"" and ""atoms""), so invalid.

""ALPHA"" -> A L P H A -> O not present? We must include O because we know it's in the word. So we cannot use a word without O.

So we must include O.

Therefore, ""ALLOW"" and ""ALLOY"" are candidates.

Let's choose ""ALLOY"" because it ends with Y, which is less common than W? But we don't know.

We can also consider words without double letters.

Is there a word with O at position 4 and no double letters?

For example: ""AFLOW"" -> not a word.

""AGLOW"" -> A G L O W -> O at position 4? A(1), G(2), L(3), O(4), W(5). And all distinct letters? Yes: A, G, L, O, W.

And we haven't tested G, L, W.

Also, avoids absent letters.

""AGLOW"" is a word meaning glowing.

Similarly, ""AGLOW"" is a valid word.

Another: ""ABLOW"" -> not common.

So ""AGLOW"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""APTLY"" -> but T is absent.

So ""AGLOW"" seems better than ""ALLOW"" or ""ALLOY"" because it has distinct letters.

We can also consider ""AFOUL"" -> but U and F? U is absent, so invalid.

""AFOOT"" -> O at position 3 and 4? And we know position 3 is wrong. Also, F and T: T is absent? T was absent in ""atoms"", so we cannot use T.

So ""AFOOT"" is invalid.

Therefore, ""AGLOW"" is a good choice.

We can also consider ""ALGAL"" -> no O.

""ALKYL"" -> no O.

So I think ""AGLOW"" is a good candidate.

But let's confirm: A G L O W.

Position 1: A (known correct)
Position 2: G (new)
Position 3: L (new)
Position 4: O (we want to test if O is at position 4)
Position 5: W (new)

We test three new letters: G, L, W.

If O is at position 4, we get a check for O. If not, we get a dash meaning O is present but not at 4, so it must be at position 2 (since positions 3 and 5 are already ruled out).

So we will know the position of O after this guess.

Also, we get information about G, L, W.

Therefore, I choose ""AGLOW"".

But wait, is ""AGLOW"" a valid Wordle word? I believe it is.

Alternatively, we can use ""ALGAE"" but E is absent.

So yes.

Therefore, fourth guess: ""AGLOW""

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
   - `C`, `R`, `N`, `E` are **absent** from the secret word.  
   - `A` is **present** but **not in position 3**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""audio"" → Feedback: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)**  
   - `A` is **correct at position 1** (secret word starts with `A`).  
   - `U`, `D`, `I` are **absent**.  
   - `O` is **present** but **not in position 5**.  

3. **Guess 3: ""atoms"" → Feedback: A(✓) T(x) O(-) M(x) S(x)**  
   - `A` is **correct at position 1** (reconfirms position 1).  
   - `T`, `M`, `S` are **absent**.  
   - `O` is **present** but **not in position 3**.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: `A _ _ _ _` (position 1 is `A`).  
- **Confirmed present letters**:  
  - `A` (position 1).  
  - `O` (must be in position 2 or 4, since positions 3 and 5 are ruled out).  
- **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `N`, `E`, `U`, `D`, `I`, `T`, `M`, `S` (cannot be used).  
- **Untested letters**: `B`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `J`, `K`, `L`, `P`, `Q`, `V`, `W`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`.  
- **Goal for next guess**:  
  - Test `O` in **position 4** (since position 2 is still untested for `O`, but position 4 is a strong candidate).  
  - Introduce new high-frequency letters to gather more information (e.g., `L`, `G`, `W`).  
  - Avoid absent letters and reuse of `A`/`O` in invalid positions.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Choose a word that:  
  - Starts with `A` (position 1).  
  - Places `O` in **position 4** (to test if it is correct there; if not, `O` must be in position 2).  
  - Uses new, common letters from the untested set (e.g., `G`, `L`, `W`).  
- **Selected word: ""AGLOW""**  
  - `A` (position 1): Confirmed correct.  
  - `G` (position 2): New letter (tests a common consonant).  
  - `L` (position 3): New letter (high-frequency consonant).  
  - `O` (position 4): Tests if `O` is correctly placed here.  
  - `W` (position 5): New letter (less common, but efficient for elimination).  
- **Why ""AGLOW""?**  
  - Maximizes information: Tests `O` in position 4 and three new letters (`G`, `L`, `W`).  
  - If `O` is correct at position 4, we get a ✓. If not, we know `O` must be at position 2.  
  - All letters are distinct and avoid absent letters.  
  - Valid English word (meaning ""glowing"" or ""radiant"").  

<guess>aglow</guess>",aglow,"We have the following feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present but wrong position (-) [position 3]
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: ""audio""
- A: correct position (✓) [position 1]
- U: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- O: present but wrong position (-) [position 5]

Guess 3: ""atoms""
- A: correct position (✓) [position 1]
- T: absent (x)
- O: present but wrong position (-) [position 3]
- M: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word starts with 'A' (since ""audio"" had A correct at position 1 and ""atoms"" confirmed it).
2. The letter 'O' is present in the word, but not at position 3 (from ""atoms"") and not at position 5 (from ""audio""). Therefore, 'O' must be at position 2 or 4.
3. Absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, T, M, S. (All marked as absent in the feedbacks)
4. Present letters: A (position 1) and O (position 2 or 4).

We have used the following letters: A, C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, T, M, S. The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, T, M, S.

The only present letters we know are A and O. Since we have two positions left (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) and we know O is in one of 2 or 4, and the other positions must be filled with letters we haven't tried yet.

We need to consider the remaining letters of the alphabet that haven't been tested: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, and we have A at position 1 and O at either 2 or 4.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: O is at position 2.
Then the word is: A O _ _ _

Case 2: O is at position 4.
Then the word is: A _ _ O _

We need to choose a word that includes O in either position 2 or 4 and uses new letters from the remaining set.

We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters from the remaining: L, P, H, G, B, F, etc.

We can try to form a word that has O in position 2 and then test other common letters, or in position 4.

But we don't know which case, so we might choose a word that has O in position 4 to test that possibility, since we haven't tested position 4 for O yet? Actually, we haven't tested position 2 or 4 directly.

In ""audio"", O was at position 5 (wrong) and in ""atoms"", O was at position 3 (wrong). So positions 2 and 4 are still possible.

We can try a word with O at position 4 to see if it is correct there.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has O at position 2 to test that.

But we also need to test other letters.

Let's list possible words that start with A, have O in position 2 or 4, and use only the available letters.

First, with O at position 2: A O _ _ _

We need to fill the last three positions with letters from B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, avoiding the absent letters.

Possible words: 
- A O L L Y (ALLY) -> but that has double L? ""ALLY"" is 4 letters? ""ALLOY"" is 5 letters: A L L O Y -> but that has O at position 4, not 2.

For position 2: 
- ""AORTA"" -> but R and T are absent? R and T are absent, so invalid.
- ""AOKAY"" -> not a word.
- ""ABOUT"" -> U is absent.
- ""ADOBE"" -> D and E absent.

It's hard to find a common word with O at position 2 without using absent letters.

Now, with O at position 4: A _ _ O _

Possible words:
- ""ALBOW"" -> not common, but ""ELBOW"" is common but doesn't start with A.
- ""ALLOW"" -> A L L O W -> but we have double L? And we haven't tested L or W. But note: we have to avoid absent letters. L and W are not in the absent list. So ""ALLOW"" is a candidate.

But ""ALLOW"" has O at position 4? Let's see: 
Position 1: A
Position 2: L
Position 3: L
Position 4: O
Position 5: W

So O is at position 4.

Another word: ""ARROW"" -> but R is absent, and also double R? and O at position 4? But R absent.

""APTLY"" -> A P T L Y -> but T is absent? T was marked absent in ""atoms"", so we cannot use T.

""ABHOR"" -> R absent.

""ALOHA"" -> A L O H A -> but O is at position 3? We need O at position 4? Actually, ""ALOHA"": A (1), L (2), O (3), H (4), A (5). So O is at position 3, which we already know is wrong (from ""atoms"", O not at 3). So we cannot use that.

We need O at position 4.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" -> not common and O not present.

""ALGAE"" -> E absent.

""ALIBI"" -> I absent.

""ALKYL"" -> not common.

""ALWAY"" -> not a word, but ""ALWAYS"" is 6 letters.

""ALOW"" is not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""ALLOW"" is the best candidate so far.

Another word: ""AVOW"" -> 4 letters.

""AVOWS"" -> A V O W S -> but S is absent? S was marked absent in ""atoms"", so we cannot use S.

Similarly, ""ATOMS"" had S at position 5 and it was absent.

So we cannot use S.

Therefore, ""ALLOW"" is a candidate: A, L, L, O, W.

But it has double L. That might be acceptable.

Another word: ""ALLOT"" -> A L L O T -> but T is absent? T was absent in ""atoms"", so we cannot use T.

So ""ALLOT"" is invalid.

""ALLOY"" -> A L L O Y -> O is at position 4? Yes: A(1), L(2), L(3), O(4), Y(5). And we haven't tested L or Y. And Y is allowed.

But ""ALLOY"" has double L. We can use it to test L and Y.

Another word: ""ALOOF"" -> A L O O F -> O at position 3? We need position 4. ""ALOOF"": A(1), L(2), O(3), O(4), F(5). So O is at both 3 and 4. But we know O is not at position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback: O at position 3 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning it is not at 3). So if we put O at position 3, we expect it to be marked as absent (if only one O) or as present but wrong position if there is another O? But we know the secret word has at least one O, but we don't know if it has two.

However, we are trying to avoid position 3 for O because we know it's not there. So putting O at position 3 might not be efficient.

But in ""ALOOF"", we have O at position 3 and 4. We know position 3 is wrong, so that O will be marked as absent (if only one O) or as present but wrong position (if there is a second O). But we are more interested in position 4.

Alternatively, we can choose a word without O at position 3.

So ""ALLOY"" is better: O at position 4.

Similarly, ""ALLOW"" has O at position 4.

But ""ALLOW"" uses W, and ""ALLOY"" uses Y.

Both are valid.

We can also consider ""ALBUM"" -> but U and M are absent? U and M are absent (from ""audio"" and ""atoms""), so invalid.

""ALPHA"" -> A L P H A -> O not present? We must include O because we know it's in the word. So we cannot use a word without O.

So we must include O.

Therefore, ""ALLOW"" and ""ALLOY"" are candidates.

Let's choose ""ALLOY"" because it ends with Y, which is less common than W? But we don't know.

We can also consider words without double letters.

Is there a word with O at position 4 and no double letters?

For example: ""AFLOW"" -> not a word.

""AGLOW"" -> A G L O W -> O at position 4? A(1), G(2), L(3), O(4), W(5). And all distinct letters? Yes: A, G, L, O, W.

And we haven't tested G, L, W.

Also, avoids absent letters.

""AGLOW"" is a word meaning glowing.

Similarly, ""AGLOW"" is a valid word.

Another: ""ABLOW"" -> not common.

So ""AGLOW"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""APTLY"" -> but T is absent.

So ""AGLOW"" seems better than ""ALLOW"" or ""ALLOY"" because it has distinct letters.

We can also consider ""AFOUL"" -> but U and F? U is absent, so invalid.

""AFOOT"" -> O at position 3 and 4? And we know position 3 is wrong. Also, F and T: T is absent? T was absent in ""atoms"", so we cannot use T.

So ""AFOOT"" is invalid.

Therefore, ""AGLOW"" is a good choice.

We can also consider ""ALGAL"" -> no O.

""ALKYL"" -> no O.

So I think ""AGLOW"" is a good candidate.

But let's confirm: A G L O W.

Position 1: A (known correct)
Position 2: G (new)
Position 3: L (new)
Position 4: O (we want to test if O is at position 4)
Position 5: W (new)

We test three new letters: G, L, W.

If O is at position 4, we get a check for O. If not, we get a dash meaning O is present but not at 4, so it must be at position 2 (since positions 3 and 5 are already ruled out).

So we will know the position of O after this guess.

Also, we get information about G, L, W.

Therefore, I choose ""AGLOW"".

But wait, is ""AGLOW"" a valid Wordle word? I believe it is.

Alternatively, we can use ""ALGAE"" but E is absent.

So yes.

Therefore, fourth guess: ""AGLOW""

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the secret word)
 R: x (not in the secret word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the secret word)
 E: x (not in the secret word)

 So, from this we know:
 - The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess at position 3 and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'A' (but not at position 3) and does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we know the secret word has 5 letters and must include 'A', we can try to think of words that have 'A' in them, but not in the third position, and without the letters C, R, N, E.

 Also, note that the first guess was ""crane"", so we have eliminated those letters.

 We need to make a second guess that:
 - Is a valid 5-letter English word.
 - Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 - Contains the letter 'A', but not at position 3 (because in ""crane"", 'A' was at position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position).

 However, note that the feedback for 'A' being present but not at position 3 does not necessarily mean it cannot be at position 3 in the secret word? Actually, wait: in the feedback, the '-' for 'A' means that the letter is in the word but not at that position. So the secret word has an 'A' but not at position 3.

 But note: the secret word might have more than one 'A'. However, we don't know that yet.

 We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test more common letters.

 Since we have eliminated C, R, N, E, we can try to use other common letters.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

 We also know that the word must contain an 'A'. So let's think of words that have an 'A' and avoid C, R, N, E.

 Also, we don't know the position of 'A', so we can try to put it in a different position.

 Let's try to choose a word that has:
 - 'A' in a position that is not 3 (so positions 1,2,4,5) and also includes other common letters that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SALAD"", but note that we have to avoid the letters we know are absent. However, in ""SALAD"", we have:
   S, A, L, A, D.

 But wait: we have two A's. That's acceptable because we don't know if the secret word has two A's.

 However, we must avoid R, N, E, C? Yes, and R, N, E, C are not in ""SALAD"". So it's a candidate.

 But let's see: we want to maximize information. We know that the word has at least one 'A'. If we use two A's, we might get information about whether there are two A's.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with only one 'A' and other new letters.

 Another idea: since we know the word has an 'A', we can try to put the 'A' in a different position to narrow down.

 In the first guess, 'A' was at position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let me think of common words:

 Option 1: ""AUDIO"" -> but that has A at position 1, and also U, D, I, O. But note: we haven't tested U, D, I, O. However, we must avoid R, N, E, C? Yes, and AUDIO doesn't have those. But wait, we also know that R is absent? Yes, from the first feedback R was marked as absent. So AUDIO is acceptable.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word has an 'A' and we are putting it at position 1. If the secret word has the 'A' at position 1, then we would get a check (✓) for the first letter. If not, then we get a dash (-) meaning it's in the word but not at 1. Also, we get to test U, D, I, O.

 However, we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess said that 'A' is in the word but not at position 3. It could be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Another option: ""PASTA"" -> but that has P, A, S, T, A. Again, no R, N, E, C. And we test P, S, T.

 But note: we have two A's again.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has the 'A' in position 2, for example: ""SAULT"" (but SAULT is not very common, and we might prefer more common words).

 Another common word: ""SLATE"" -> but wait, we know E is absent (from first feedback: E was marked as absent). So we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use R, N, C.

 So we must avoid E, R, N, C.

 Let me list some words that have an 'A' and avoid E, R, N, C:

 - SALAD: S, A, L, A, D -> positions: S1, A2, L3, A4, D5 -> we have A at 2 and 4.
 - PASTA: P1, A2, S3, T4, A5 -> A at 2 and 5.
 - PASTY: but Y is not very common and also we have to avoid E? Pastry has R? No, PASTY is P,A,S,T,Y -> but we don't know about Y. However, it's a valid word.
 - PLAIT: but has L, A, I, T? and P. But note: we don't know about P, L, I, T. However, it has an 'A' at position 3? But wait, we are not supposed to put 'A' at position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3 again? But the feedback said that the secret word has an 'A' but not at position 3. So if we put an 'A' at position 3 and it is the same as the secret word's 'A'? Actually, no: because the secret word's 'A' is not at position 3. So if we put an 'A' at position 3 and the secret word has only one 'A', then we would get an 'x' for that. But if the secret word has two A's, one of which is at position 3? But wait, the feedback for the first guess said that the 'A' at position 3 is present but in the wrong position? That would be contradictory because if the secret word has an 'A' at position 3, then the first guess would have gotten a check (✓) for the 'A' at position 3? But it didn't, it got a dash (-). So the secret word does not have an 'A' at position 3. Therefore, if we put an 'A' at position 3 in our new guess, we would get an 'x' for that position (if the secret word has only one 'A') or a dash for that position if the secret word has another 'A' that is not at position 3? Actually, no: the dash means that the letter is in the word but not at that position. So if we put an 'A' at position 3 and the secret word has an 'A' but not at position 3 (and also not at that same position in the secret word) then we would get a dash? But wait, the feedback is per letter occurrence. If the secret word has two A's, and we have two A's in our guess, then each A in the guess is evaluated independently.

 However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to avoid putting the 'A' at position 3 again because we know it's not there. We can put it in a different position to test.

 So let's choose a word that has an 'A' in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and also includes other common letters we haven't tried.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:
 - It has A at position 1 (so we test if the secret word has A at position 1).
 - It has U, D, I, O which are common and we haven't tested.

 But note: the secret word might not have any of these, but we are trying to get information.

 However, we must consider that the secret word has at least one 'A'. So if we put 'A' at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash meaning it's in the word but not at 1. Then we also test U, D, I, O.

 But wait: what if the secret word has two A's? Then we might get a dash for the first A and then we don't have another A in the word to test? So we wouldn't know about the second A. But that's okay because we are still in the early stage.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has only one 'A' and in a new position, and also includes other common letters.

 Another common word: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. The 'A' is at position 3? But we are avoiding position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3? But we know the secret word does not have an 'A' at position 3. So if we put an 'A' at position 3, we expect it to be marked as absent (if the secret word has only one 'A') or as present but wrong position (if there is a second 'A' elsewhere). But that might be confusing. So to avoid that, let's not put the 'A' at position 3.

 In ""STAMP"", the 'A' is at position 3. So we avoid that.

 How about ""PASTA""? It has two A's: one at position 2 and one at position 5. We avoid position 3. So we can use that.

 But let me check: P, A, S, T, A. We haven't tested P, S, T. And we avoid R, N, E, C.

 So ""PASTA"" is a valid word.

 Another option: ""SAULT"" (which is a word, meaning a leap or a jump, but not very common). Or ""SALTY"", but we know E is absent? SALTY has T and Y, but we don't know about T and Y. However, we also have to avoid E? Yes, and SALTY doesn't have E.

 But I think ""PASTA"" is more common.

 Alternatively, ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> has A at position 2. And we test D, I, L, Y.

 But note: we don't know about D, I, L, Y.

 However, we are trying to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, etc.

 In ""PASTA"": we test P, A, S, T, A -> so we test P, S, T and two A's.

 In ""AUDIO"": we test A, U, D, I, O.

 Which one gives more information? Both are good.

 But note: we already know that the word has an 'A'. So testing two A's in ""PASTA"" might be less efficient if the word has only one A. But if it has two, then we get more information.

 However, I think I'll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests more vowels and we haven't tested any vowels except A (and we know E is absent). So we can test U, I, O.

 But wait: the first guess had A and E? And we know E is absent. So we have only tested A and E? And E is absent. So we have not tested any other vowels? So testing U, I, O is good.

 Also, we are putting A at position 1.

 So let's choose ""AUDIO"".

 But note: the word must be in the word list. I believe ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""AUDIO"".

<guess>audio</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.
- A is **present** but **not in position 3**.

For the second guess:
- Must include **A** (in a position other than 3) and avoid C, R, N, E.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, U, D, I) to maximize information.
- ""AUDIO"" is chosen because:
  - Places A in position 1 (testing if A is correctly placed there).
  - Introduces new common letters U, D, I, O (vowels and consonants not yet tested).
  - Avoids reused letters (C, R, N, E) and covers multiple positions.

<guess>audio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses.
First guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Second guess: ""audio"" -> Feedback: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)

From first guess:
- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.
- A is in the word but not at position 3 (from crane, A was at position 3).

From second guess: ""audio""
- A: ✓ -> This means that A is in the secret word and at position 1. So the secret word starts with A.
- U: x -> U is not in the word.
- D: x -> D is not in the word.
- I: x -> I is not in the word.
- O: - -> O is in the word but not at position 5 (since in audio, O was at position 5).

So we now know:
- The secret word starts with A (position 1 is A).
- A is also not at position 3 (from first guess) but we now know it's at position 1.
- O is in the word, but not at position 5.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I (from both guesses).

Also, from the first guess, we know A is not at position 3, but now we have A fixed at position 1.

Therefore, the secret word is: A _ _ _ _

Where:
- The first letter is A.
- The word contains O (but not at position 5).
- Does not contain: C, R, N, E, U, D, I.

We need to make a third guess.

We know the word has at least two distinct letters: A and O, and possibly others.

We have tested the following letters: C, R, A, N, E, U, D, I, O. And we know A and O are present (A at position 1, O present but not at position 5).

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: S, T, L, M, P, etc.

We also know that in the secret word, O is not at position 5. So O must be at one of positions 2, 3, or 4.

We can try to find a word that:
- Starts with A (since we know position 1 is A).
- Contains O in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- Uses other available letters that are common and we haven't tested.

Possible words:

We might try to put O at position 2: e.g., ""A_O _ _""

But note: if we put O at position 2, and the secret word has O at position 2, we would get a check. If not, but O is present, we get a dash.

Similarly, we can try positions 3 or 4.

We also want to test other new letters.

Let's list some candidate words:

- Option: ""ABOUT"" -> but wait, we know U is absent? And also, we have to start with A. ""ABOUT"" doesn't start with A. So invalid.

- ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T -> starts with A. Has O at position 3. And tests L, F, T.
  - But we don't know if F, T, L are present or not.

However, we must avoid using known absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I.

""ALOFT"" is clean: A, L, O, F, T.

Similarly, ""ALOUD"" -> but D is absent? We know D is absent, so we cannot use D. So ""ALOUD"" is invalid.

""ABORT"" -> but R is absent? R is in the absent list. So no.

""AFOOT"" -> A, F, O, O, T. But has two O's. We don't know if the word has two O's. Also, tests F and T.

But ""AFOOT"" means having to do with feet, and it's a valid word.

But note: O is present, and we put it at position 3 and 4. Since we know O is present but not at position 5, positions 3 and 4 are allowed.

Another option: ""ASTOP"" -> but that might not be a common word. And we know S? We haven't tested S.

But perhaps ""ALOFT"" is better.

Another word: ""ALLOT"" -> A, L, L, O, T. Has double L. And O at position 4.

But we don't know about L or T.

Perhaps we can choose a word that doesn't repeat letters to get more information.

But ""ALOFT"" has distinct letters except for the position? A, L, O, F, T are distinct? Yes, all distinct.

Similarly, ""ATOP"" is only 4 letters? Wait, 5-letter word. ""ATOPY"" but that's medical and uncommon.

Another word: ""ABOIL"" -> not common.

I think ""ALOFT"" is a good candidate because:
- It starts with A (which we know is correct, so we'll get a check on A).
- It has O at position 3 (so we can see if O is at position 3 or not).
- It introduces new common letters: L, F, T.

But note: the word ""ALOFT"" means airborne? It's valid.

Alternatively, we can put O at position 2: words like ""AORTA"" or ""AORTAL"" (too long). ""AORTA"" is 5 letters: A, O, R, T, A. But R is absent? We know R is absent. So ""AORTA"" has R -> invalid because R is absent.

""AVOID"" -> but we know D is absent? And also I is absent? So ""AVOID"" has D and I -> both absent -> invalid.

""AVOW"" -> 4 letters.

So not many with O at position 2.

Now, O at position 4: words like ""ADOBE"" -> but D and E are absent? E is absent and D is absent. So ""ADOBE"" is invalid.

""AGONE"" -> but G, O, N, E? But N and E are absent? N is absent, E is absent -> invalid.

So perhaps position 3 or 4 are more feasible.

Another word: ""ATOLL"" -> A, T, O, L, L. Has O at position 3. But uses L twice? And tests T, O, L.

Or ""APTLY"" -> A, P, T, L, Y. But that doesn't have O? We know O must be in the word. So if we don't include O, we won't get information about its position.

We must include O in our guess because we know it's present and we need to find its position.

So any guess must include O (and avoid absent letters).

So back to ""ALOFT"": it has O at position 3.

Another option: ""ASCOT"" -> A, S, C, O, T. But C is absent? We know C is absent. So invalid.

""ASKOI"" -> not common.

""ALLOW"" -> but W? And O at position 4? Also, we have double L. But ""ALLOW"" doesn't start with A? It starts with A? A L L O W -> yes, starts with A. But has O at position 4.

But we must avoid C,R,N,E,U,D,I -> ""ALLOW"" uses A,L,L,O,W -> all allowed? Yes, L and W are new.

Wait, we haven't tested W. So ""ALLOW"" is a candidate: A, L, L, O, W.

Similarly, ""ALLOT"": A, L, L, O, T.

But what information do we get from double letters? If the secret word has only one L, then one of the L's might be marked as absent? Or both might be marked as dash if there are two L's? It's tricky.

To avoid complexity, maybe choose a word with distinct letters.

""ALOFT"": distinct letters A, L, O, F, T.

""ALOFT"" and ""ALLOW"" are both candidates.

But ""ALLOW"" has double L, so it takes two letter slots for L. If the secret word has one L, we might waste one slot.

Similarly, ""AFOOT"" has double O.

We know O is present, so we can use one O? But if we use two, we can test if there is more than one O.

But since we are early, we can stick to distinct letters.

So I'll go with ""ALOFT"".

But wait: we have tested A in position 1 (known) and O in position 3 (unknown). We also test L, F, T.

Alternatively, we can put O in a different position? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""ATOMS"" -> A, T, O, M, S. O at position 3. Tests T, O, M, S.

But ""ATOMS"" is a valid word. And all letters distinct? Yes: A, T, O, M, S.

Similarly, ""ATOMY"" -> not as common.

Or ""AVOWS"" -> but O is at position 3? And V, O, W, S? And we test V, W, S. But ""AVOWS"" starts with A.

But ""ATOMS"" is a very common word.

Compare ""ATOMS"" and ""ALOFT"":
- Both start with A.
- Both have O at position 3.
- ""ATOMS"" tests T, O, M, S (and we know A and O are present, so we are testing T, M, S).
- ""ALOFT"" tests L, O, F, T.

We haven't tested either set. Both are fine.

Since S and T are very common in English, I'll go with ""ATOMS"" because it includes S and T.

But note: in the first guess, we had C and S? No, in ""crane"" we had C (absent), not S.

S hasn't been tested yet. Similarly, T hasn't been tested.

So ""ATOMS"": A (known at position 1), T (new), O (known present), M (new), S (new).

This way we test three new letters: T, M, S.

We know that O is present and not at position 5, but we put it at position 3? So if O is actually at position 3, we get a check. If it's at position 2 or 4, we get a dash for O at position 3? And then we will know O is not at 3.

Similarly, if we put O at position 3 and it's not in the word? But we know O is present, so it will be either check or dash.

So let's choose ""ATOMS"".

But we must make sure that the word does not contain any absent letters? It doesn't: A, T, O, M, S — none of C,R,N,E,U,D,I.

So ""ATOMS"" is valid.

Therefore, my third guess is ""ATOMS"".

<guess>atoms</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:  
- **Guess 1:** ""crane"" → `C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)`  
  - `C`, `R`, `N`, `E` are **absent**.  
  - `A` is **present** but **not in position 3** (since the feedback was `-` for position 3).  

- **Guess 2:** ""audio"" → `A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)`  
  - `A` is **correct at position 1** (✓).  
  - `U`, `D`, `I` are **absent**.  
  - `O` is **present** but **not in position 5** (since the feedback was `-` for position 5).  

### Key Information:  
1. The secret word **starts with `A`** (position 1).  
2. `O` is in the word but **not at position 5**.  
3. Absent letters: `C`, `R`, `N`, `E`, `U`, `D`, `I` (cannot be used).  
4. Present letters: `A` and `O` (must be included, with `A` fixed at position 1).  
5. Untested letters: Common consonants like `S`, `T`, `L`, `M`, `P`, etc.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:  
- The word must start with `A` and include `O` (not at position 5).  
- To locate `O`, test it in **position 3** (since position 1 is taken by `A`, and position 5 is ruled out; positions 2 or 4 are also possible but position 3 is untested).  
- Prioritize testing high-frequency letters (`S`, `T`, `M`) to gather more information.  
- Avoid reused or absent letters (`C`, `R`, `N`, `E`, `U`, `D`, `I`).  
- Choose a valid 5-letter word: **""ATOMS""** fits because:  
  - Starts with `A` (position 1).  
  - Places `O` at position 3 (to check if correct or misplaced).  
  - Introduces new common letters: `T` (position 2), `M` (position 4), `S` (position 5).  
  - No duplicate or absent letters, maximizing information potential.

<guess>atoms</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)
Guess 3: atoms -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) T(x) O(-) M(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present but wrong position (-) [position 3]
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: ""audio""
- A: correct position (✓) [position 1]
- U: absent (x)
- D: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- O: present but wrong position (-) [position 5]

Guess 3: ""atoms""
- A: correct position (✓) [position 1]
- T: absent (x)
- O: present but wrong position (-) [position 3]
- M: absent (x)
- S: absent (x)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word starts with 'A' (since ""audio"" had A correct at position 1 and ""atoms"" confirmed it).
2. The letter 'O' is present in the word, but not at position 3 (from ""atoms"") and not at position 5 (from ""audio""). Therefore, 'O' must be at position 2 or 4.
3. Absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, T, M, S. (All marked as absent in the feedbacks)
4. Present letters: A (position 1) and O (position 2 or 4).

We have used the following letters: A, C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, T, M, S. The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, T, M, S.

The only present letters we know are A and O. Since we have two positions left (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) and we know O is in one of 2 or 4, and the other positions must be filled with letters we haven't tried yet.

We need to consider the remaining letters of the alphabet that haven't been tested: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, and we have A at position 1 and O at either 2 or 4.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: O is at position 2.
Then the word is: A O _ _ _

Case 2: O is at position 4.
Then the word is: A _ _ O _

We need to choose a word that includes O in either position 2 or 4 and uses new letters from the remaining set.

We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters from the remaining: L, P, H, G, B, F, etc.

We can try to form a word that has O in position 2 and then test other common letters, or in position 4.

But we don't know which case, so we might choose a word that has O in position 4 to test that possibility, since we haven't tested position 4 for O yet? Actually, we haven't tested position 2 or 4 directly.

In ""audio"", O was at position 5 (wrong) and in ""atoms"", O was at position 3 (wrong). So positions 2 and 4 are still possible.

We can try a word with O at position 4 to see if it is correct there.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has O at position 2 to test that.

But we also need to test other letters.

Let's list possible words that start with A, have O in position 2 or 4, and use only the available letters.

First, with O at position 2: A O _ _ _

We need to fill the last three positions with letters from B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, avoiding the absent letters.

Possible words: 
- A O L L Y (ALLY) -> but that has double L? ""ALLY"" is 4 letters? ""ALLOY"" is 5 letters: A L L O Y -> but that has O at position 4, not 2.

For position 2: 
- ""AORTA"" -> but R and T are absent? R and T are absent, so invalid.
- ""AOKAY"" -> not a word.
- ""ABOUT"" -> U is absent.
- ""ADOBE"" -> D and E absent.

It's hard to find a common word with O at position 2 without using absent letters.

Now, with O at position 4: A _ _ O _

Possible words:
- ""ALBOW"" -> not common, but ""ELBOW"" is common but doesn't start with A.
- ""ALLOW"" -> A L L O W -> but we have double L? And we haven't tested L or W. But note: we have to avoid absent letters. L and W are not in the absent list. So ""ALLOW"" is a candidate.

But ""ALLOW"" has O at position 4? Let's see: 
Position 1: A
Position 2: L
Position 3: L
Position 4: O
Position 5: W

So O is at position 4.

Another word: ""ARROW"" -> but R is absent, and also double R? and O at position 4? But R absent.

""APTLY"" -> A P T L Y -> but T is absent? T was marked absent in ""atoms"", so we cannot use T.

""ABHOR"" -> R absent.

""ALOHA"" -> A L O H A -> but O is at position 3? We need O at position 4? Actually, ""ALOHA"": A (1), L (2), O (3), H (4), A (5). So O is at position 3, which we already know is wrong (from ""atoms"", O not at 3). So we cannot use that.

We need O at position 4.

Another word: ""ALGAL"" -> not common and O not present.

""ALGAE"" -> E absent.

""ALIBI"" -> I absent.

""ALKYL"" -> not common.

""ALWAY"" -> not a word, but ""ALWAYS"" is 6 letters.

""ALOW"" is not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""ALLOW"" is the best candidate so far.

Another word: ""AVOW"" -> 4 letters.

""AVOWS"" -> A V O W S -> but S is absent? S was marked absent in ""atoms"", so we cannot use S.

Similarly, ""ATOMS"" had S at position 5 and it was absent.

So we cannot use S.

Therefore, ""ALLOW"" is a candidate: A, L, L, O, W.

But it has double L. That might be acceptable.

Another word: ""ALLOT"" -> A L L O T -> but T is absent? T was absent in ""atoms"", so we cannot use T.

So ""ALLOT"" is invalid.

""ALLOY"" -> A L L O Y -> O is at position 4? Yes: A(1), L(2), L(3), O(4), Y(5). And we haven't tested L or Y. And Y is allowed.

But ""ALLOY"" has double L. We can use it to test L and Y.

Another word: ""ALOOF"" -> A L O O F -> O at position 3? We need position 4. ""ALOOF"": A(1), L(2), O(3), O(4), F(5). So O is at both 3 and 4. But we know O is not at position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback: O at position 3 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning it is not at 3). So if we put O at position 3, we expect it to be marked as absent (if only one O) or as present but wrong position if there is another O? But we know the secret word has at least one O, but we don't know if it has two.

However, we are trying to avoid position 3 for O because we know it's not there. So putting O at position 3 might not be efficient.

But in ""ALOOF"", we have O at position 3 and 4. We know position 3 is wrong, so that O will be marked as absent (if only one O) or as present but wrong position (if there is a second O). But we are more interested in position 4.

Alternatively, we can choose a word without O at position 3.

So ""ALLOY"" is better: O at position 4.

Similarly, ""ALLOW"" has O at position 4.

But ""ALLOW"" uses W, and ""ALLOY"" uses Y.

Both are valid.

We can also consider ""ALBUM"" -> but U and M are absent? U and M are absent (from ""audio"" and ""atoms""), so invalid.

""ALPHA"" -> A L P H A -> O not present? We must include O because we know it's in the word. So we cannot use a word without O.

So we must include O.

Therefore, ""ALLOW"" and ""ALLOY"" are candidates.

Let's choose ""ALLOY"" because it ends with Y, which is less common than W? But we don't know.

We can also consider words without double letters.

Is there a word with O at position 4 and no double letters?

For example: ""AFLOW"" -> not a word.

""AGLOW"" -> A G L O W -> O at position 4? A(1), G(2), L(3), O(4), W(5). And all distinct letters? Yes: A, G, L, O, W.

And we haven't tested G, L, W.

Also, avoids absent letters.

""AGLOW"" is a word meaning glowing.

Similarly, ""AGLOW"" is a valid word.

Another: ""ABLOW"" -> not common.

So ""AGLOW"" is a good candidate.

Similarly, ""APTLY"" -> but T is absent.

So ""AGLOW"" seems better than ""ALLOW"" or ""ALLOY"" because it has distinct letters.

We can also consider ""AFOUL"" -> but U and F? U is absent, so invalid.

""AFOOT"" -> O at position 3 and 4? And we know position 3 is wrong. Also, F and T: T is absent? T was absent in ""atoms"", so we cannot use T.

So ""AFOOT"" is invalid.

Therefore, ""AGLOW"" is a good choice.

We can also consider ""ALGAL"" -> no O.

""ALKYL"" -> no O.

So I think ""AGLOW"" is a good candidate.

But let's confirm: A G L O W.

Position 1: A (known correct)
Position 2: G (new)
Position 3: L (new)
Position 4: O (we want to test if O is at position 4)
Position 5: W (new)

We test three new letters: G, L, W.

If O is at position 4, we get a check for O. If not, we get a dash meaning O is present but not at 4, so it must be at position 2 (since positions 3 and 5 are already ruled out).

So we will know the position of O after this guess.

Also, we get information about G, L, W.

Therefore, I choose ""AGLOW"".

But wait, is ""AGLOW"" a valid Wordle word? I believe it is.

Alternatively, we can use ""ALGAE"" but E is absent.

So yes.

Therefore, fourth guess: ""AGLOW""

<guess>aglow</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  
   - `C`, `R`, `N`, `E` are **absent** from the secret word.  
   - `A` is **present** but **not in position 3**.  

2. **Guess 2: ""audio"" → Feedback: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)**  
   - `A` is **correct at position 1** (secret word starts with `A`).  
   - `U`, `D`, `I` are **absent**.  
   - `O` is **present** but **not in position 5**.  

3. **Guess 3: ""atoms"" → Feedback: A(✓) T(x) O(-) M(x) S(x)**  
   - `A` is **correct at position 1** (reconfirms position 1).  
   - `T`, `M`, `S` are **absent**.  
   - `O` is **present** but **not in position 3**.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: `A _ _ _ _` (position 1 is `A`).  
- **Confirmed present letters**:  
  - `A` (position 1).  
  - `O` (must be in position 2 or 4, since positions 3 and 5 are ruled out).  
- **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `N`, `E`, `U`, `D`, `I`, `T`, `M`, `S` (cannot be used).  
- **Untested letters**: `B`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `J`, `K`, `L`, `P`, `Q`, `V`, `W`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`.  
- **Goal for next guess**:  
  - Test `O` in **position 4** (since position 2 is still untested for `O`, but position 4 is a strong candidate).  
  - Introduce new high-frequency letters to gather more information (e.g., `L`, `G`, `W`).  
  - Avoid absent letters and reuse of `A`/`O` in invalid positions.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Choose a word that:  
  - Starts with `A` (position 1).  
  - Places `O` in **position 4** (to test if it is correct there; if not, `O` must be in position 2).  
  - Uses new, common letters from the untested set (e.g., `G`, `L`, `W`).  
- **Selected word: ""AGLOW""**  
  - `A` (position 1): Confirmed correct.  
  - `G` (position 2): New letter (tests a common consonant).  
  - `L` (position 3): New letter (high-frequency consonant).  
  - `O` (position 4): Tests if `O` is correctly placed here.  
  - `W` (position 5): New letter (less common, but efficient for elimination).  
- **Why ""AGLOW""?**  
  - Maximizes information: Tests `O` in position 4 and three new letters (`G`, `L`, `W`).  
  - If `O` is correct at position 4, we get a ✓. If not, we know `O` must be at position 2.  
  - All letters are distinct and avoid absent letters.  
  - Valid English word (meaning ""glowing"" or ""radiant"").

Actually, wait: in the feedback, the \'-\' for \'A\' means that the letter is in the word but not at that position. So the secret word has an \'A\' but not at position 3.\n\n But note: the secret word might have more than one \'A\'. However, we don\'t know that yet.\n\n We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test more common letters.\n\n Since we have eliminated C, R, N, E, we can try to use other common letters.\n\n Common letters in English 5-letter words: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.\n\n We also know that the word must contain an \'A\'. So let\'s think of words that have an \'A\' and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\n Also, we don\'t know the position of \'A\', so we can try to put it in a different position.\n\n Let\'s try to choose a word that has:\n - \'A\' in a position that is not 3 (so positions 1,2,4,5) and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n We haven\'t used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, etc.\n\n A good candidate might be ""SALAD"", but note that we have to avoid the letters we know are absent. However, in ""SALAD"", we have:\n   S, A, L, A, D.\n\n But wait: we have two A\'s. That\'s acceptable because we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s.\n\n However, we must avoid R, N, E, C? Yes, and R, N, E, C are not in ""SALAD"". So it\'s a candidate.\n\n But let\'s see: we want to maximize information. We know that the word has at least one \'A\'. If we use two A\'s, we might get information about whether there are two A\'s.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word with only one \'A\' and other new letters.\n\n Another idea: since we know the word has an \'A\', we can try to put the \'A\' in a different position to narrow down.\n\n In the first guess, \'A\' was at position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me think of common words:\n\n Option 1: ""AUDIO"" -> but that has A at position 1, and also U, D, I, O. But note: we haven\'t tested U, D, I, O. However, we must avoid R, N, E, C? Yes, and AUDIO doesn\'t have those. But wait, we also know that R is absent? Yes, from the first feedback R was marked as absent. So AUDIO is acceptable.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the secret word has an \'A\' and we are putting it at position 1. If the secret word has the \'A\' at position 1, then we would get a check (✓) for the first letter. If not, then we get a dash (-) meaning it\'s in the word but not at 1. Also, we get to test U, D, I, O.\n\n However, we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess said that \'A\' is in the word but not at position 3. It could be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Another option: ""PASTA"" -> but that has P, A, S, T, A. Again, no R, N, E, C. And we test P, S, T.\n\n But note: we have two A\'s again.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has the \'A\' in position 2, for example: ""SAULT"" (but SAULT is not very common, and we might prefer more common words).\n\n Another common word: ""SLATE"" -> but wait, we know E is absent (from first feedback: E was marked as absent). So we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use R, N, C.\n\n So we must avoid E, R, N, C.\n\n Let me list some words that have an \'A\' and avoid E, R, N, C:\n\n - SALAD: S, A, L, A, D -> positions: S1, A2, L3, A4, D5 -> we have A at 2 and 4.\n - PASTA: P1, A2, S3, T4, A5 -> A at 2 and 5.\n - PASTY: but Y is not very common and also we have to avoid E? Pastry has R? No, PASTY is P,A,S,T,Y -> but we don\'t know about Y. However, it\'s a valid word.\n - PLAIT: but has L, A, I, T? and P. But note: we don\'t know about P, L, I, T. However, it has an \'A\' at position 3? But wait, we are not supposed to put \'A\' at position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3 again? But the feedback said that the secret word has an \'A\' but not at position 3. So if we put an \'A\' at position 3 and it is the same as the secret word\'s \'A\'? Actually, no: because the secret word\'s \'A\' is not at position 3. So if we put an \'A\' at position 3 and the secret word has only one \'A\', then we would get an \'x\' for that. But if the secret word has two A\'s, one of which is at position 3? But wait, the feedback for the first guess said that the \'A\' at position 3 is present but in the wrong position? That would be contradictory because if the secret word has an \'A\' at position 3, then the first guess would have gotten a check (✓) for the \'A\' at position 3? But it didn\'t, it got a dash (-). So the secret word does not have an \'A\' at position 3. Therefore, if we put an \'A\' at position 3 in our new guess, we would get an \'x\' for that position (if the secret word has only one \'A\') or a dash for that position if the secret word has another \'A\' that is not at position 3? Actually, no: the dash means that the letter is in the word but not at that position. So if we put an \'A\' at position 3 and the secret word has an \'A\' but not at position 3 (and also not at that same position in the secret word) then we would get a dash? But wait, the feedback is per letter occurrence. If the secret word has two A\'s, and we have two A\'s in our guess, then each A in the guess is evaluated independently.\n\n However, to avoid confusion, it might be better to avoid putting the \'A\' at position 3 again because we know it\'s not there. We can put it in a different position to test.\n\n So let\'s choose a word that has an \'A\' in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and also includes other common letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:\n - It has A at position 1 (so we test if the secret word has A at position 1).\n - It has U, D, I, O which are common and we haven\'t tested.\n\n But note: the secret word might not have any of these, but we are trying to get information.\n\n However, we must consider that the secret word has at least one \'A\'. So if we put \'A\' at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash meaning it\'s in the word but not at 1. Then we also test U, D, I, O.\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has two A\'s? Then we might get a dash for the first A and then we don\'t have another A in the word to test? So we wouldn\'t know about the second A. But that\'s okay because we are still in the early stage.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has only one \'A\' and in a new position, and also includes other common letters.\n\n Another common word: ""STAMP"" -> S, T, A, M, P. The \'A\' is at position 3? But we are avoiding position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3? But we know the secret word does not have an \'A\' at position 3. So if we put an \'A\' at position 3, we expect it to be marked as absent (if the secret word has only one \'A\') or as present but wrong position (if there is a second \'A\' elsewhere). But that might be confusing. So to avoid that, let\'s not put the \'A\' at position 3.\n\n In ""STAMP"", the \'A\' is at position 3. So we avoid that.\n\n How about ""PASTA""? It has two A\'s: one at position 2 and one at position 5. We avoid position 3. So we can use that.\n\n But let me check: P, A, S, T, A. We haven\'t tested P, S, T. And we avoid R, N, E, C.\n\n So ""PASTA"" is a valid word.\n\n Another option: ""SAULT"" (which is a word, meaning a leap or a jump, but not very common). Or ""SALTY"", but we know E is absent? SALTY has T and Y, but we don\'t know about T and Y. However, we also have to avoid E? Yes, and SALTY doesn\'t have E.\n\n But I think ""PASTA"" is more common.\n\n Alternatively, ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> has A at position 2. And we test D, I, L, Y.\n\n But note: we don\'t know about D, I, L, Y.\n\n However, we are trying to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, etc.\n\n In ""PASTA"": we test P, A, S, T, A -> so we test P, S, T and two A\'s.\n\n In ""AUDIO"": we test A, U, D, I, O.\n\n Which one gives more information? Both are good.\n\n But note: we already know that the word has an \'A\'. So testing two A\'s in ""PASTA"" might be less efficient if the word has only one A. But if it has two, then we get more information.\n\n However, I think I\'ll go with ""AUDIO"" because it tests more vowels and we haven\'t tested any vowels except A (and we know E is absent). So we can test U, I, O.\n\n But wait: the first guess had A and E? And we know E is absent. So we have only tested A and E? And E is absent. So we have not tested any other vowels? So testing U, I, O is good.\n\n Also, we are putting A at position 1.\n\n So let\'s choose ""AUDIO"".\n\n But note: the word must be in the word list. I believe ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.\n\n Therefore, my second guess is ""AUDIO"".\n\n<guess>audio</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, E are **absent** from the secret word.\n- A is **present** but **not in position 3**.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include **A** (in a position other than 3) and avoid C, R, N, E.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, U, D, I) to maximize information.\n- ""AUDIO"" is chosen because:\n  - Places A in position 1 (testing if A is correctly placed there).\n  - Introduces new common letters U, D, I, O (vowels and consonants not yet tested).\n  - Avoids reused letters (C, R, N, E) and covers multiple positions.\n\n<guess>audio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses.\nFirst guess: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nSecond guess: ""audio"" -> Feedback: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)\n\nFrom first guess:\n- C, R, N, E are not in the secret word.\n- A is in the word but not at position 3 (from crane, A was at position 3).\n\nFrom second guess: ""audio""\n- A: ✓ -> This means that A is in the secret word and at position 1. So the secret word starts with A.\n- U: x -> U is not in the word.\n- D: x -> D is not in the word.\n- I: x -> I is not in the word.\n- O: - -> O is in the word but not at position 5 (since in audio, O was at position 5).\n\nSo we now know:\n- The secret word starts with A (position 1 is A).\n- A is also not at position 3 (from first guess) but we now know it\'s at position 1.\n- O is in the word, but not at position 5.\n- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E, U, D, I (from both guesses).\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know A is not at position 3, but now we have A fixed at position 1.\n\nTherefore, the secret word is: A _ _ _ _\n\nWhere:\n- The first letter is A.\n- The word contains O (but not at position 5).\n- Does not contain: C, R, N, E, U, D, I.\n\nWe need to make a third guess.\n\nWe know the word has at least two distinct letters: A and O, and possibly others.\n\nWe have tested the following letters: C, R, A, N, E, U, D, I, O. And we know A and O are present (A at position 1, O present but not at position 5).\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, M, P, etc.\n\nWe also know that in the secret word, O is not at position 5. So O must be at one of positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\nWe can try to find a word that:\n- Starts with A (since we know position 1 is A).\n- Contains O in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n- Uses other available letters that are common and we haven\'t tested.\n\nPossible words:\n\nWe might try to put O at position 2: e.g., ""A_O _ _""\n\nBut note: if we put O at position 2, and the secret word has O at position 2, we would get a check. If not, but O is present, we get a dash.\n\nSimilarly, we can try positions 3 or 4.\n\nWe also want to test other new letters.\n\nLet\'s list some candidate words:\n\n- Option: ""ABOUT"" -> but wait, we know U is absent? And also, we have to start with A. ""ABOUT"" doesn\'t start with A. So invalid.\n\n- ""ALOFT"": A, L, O, F, T -> starts with A. Has O at position 3. And tests L, F, T.\n  - But we don\'t know if F, T, L are present or not.\n\nHowever, we must avoid using known absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I.\n\n""ALOFT"" is clean: A, L, O, F, T.\n\nSimilarly, ""ALOUD"" -> but D is absent? We know D is absent, so we cannot use D. So ""ALOUD"" is invalid.\n\n""ABORT"" -> but R is absent? R is in the absent list. So no.\n\n""AFOOT"" -> A, F, O, O, T. But has two O\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two O\'s. Also, tests F and T.\n\nBut ""AFOOT"" means having to do with feet, and it\'s a valid word.\n\nBut note: O is present, and we put it at position 3 and 4. Since we know O is present but not at position 5, positions 3 and 4 are allowed.\n\nAnother option: ""ASTOP"" -> but that might not be a common word. And we know S? We haven\'t tested S.\n\nBut perhaps ""ALOFT"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""ALLOT"" -> A, L, L, O, T. Has double L. And O at position 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know about L or T.\n\nPerhaps we can choose a word that doesn\'t repeat letters to get more information.\n\nBut ""ALOFT"" has distinct letters except for the position? A, L, O, F, T are distinct? Yes, all distinct.\n\nSimilarly, ""ATOP"" is only 4 letters? Wait, 5-letter word. ""ATOPY"" but that\'s medical and uncommon.\n\nAnother word: ""ABOIL"" -> not common.\n\nI think ""ALOFT"" is a good candidate because:\n- It starts with A (which we know is correct, so we\'ll get a check on A).\n- It has O at position 3 (so we can see if O is at position 3 or not).\n- It introduces new common letters: L, F, T.\n\nBut note: the word ""ALOFT"" means airborne? It\'s valid.\n\nAlternatively, we can put O at position 2: words like ""AORTA"" or ""AORTAL"" (too long). ""AORTA"" is 5 letters: A, O, R, T, A. But R is absent? We know R is absent. So ""AORTA"" has R -> invalid because R is absent.\n\n""AVOID"" -> but we know D is absent? And also I is absent? So ""AVOID"" has D and I -> both absent -> invalid.\n\n""AVOW"" -> 4 letters.\n\nSo not many with O at position 2.\n\nNow, O at position 4: words like ""ADOBE"" -> but D and E are absent? E is absent and D is absent. So ""ADOBE"" is invalid.\n\n""AGONE"" -> but G, O, N, E? But N and E are absent? N is absent, E is absent -> invalid.\n\nSo perhaps position 3 or 4 are more feasible.\n\nAnother word: ""ATOLL"" -> A, T, O, L, L. Has O at position 3. But uses L twice? And tests T, O, L.\n\nOr ""APTLY"" -> A, P, T, L, Y. But that doesn\'t have O? We know O must be in the word. So if we don\'t include O, we won\'t get information about its position.\n\nWe must include O in our guess because we know it\'s present and we need to find its position.\n\nSo any guess must include O (and avoid absent letters).\n\nSo back to ""ALOFT"": it has O at position 3.\n\nAnother option: ""ASCOT"" -> A, S, C, O, T. But C is absent? We know C is absent. So invalid.\n\n""ASKOI"" -> not common.\n\n""ALLOW"" -> but W? And O at position 4? Also, we have double L. But ""ALLOW"" doesn\'t start with A? It starts with A? A L L O W -> yes, starts with A. But has O at position 4.\n\nBut we must avoid C,R,N,E,U,D,I -> ""ALLOW"" uses A,L,L,O,W -> all allowed? Yes, L and W are new.\n\nWait, we haven\'t tested W. So ""ALLOW"" is a candidate: A, L, L, O, W.\n\nSimilarly, ""ALLOT"": A, L, L, O, T.\n\nBut what information do we get from double letters? If the secret word has only one L, then one of the L\'s might be marked as absent? Or both might be marked as dash if there are two L\'s? It\'s tricky.\n\nTo avoid complexity, maybe choose a word with distinct letters.\n\n""ALOFT"": distinct letters A, L, O, F, T.\n\n""ALOFT"" and ""ALLOW"" are both candidates.\n\nBut ""ALLOW"" has double L, so it takes two letter slots for L. If the secret word has one L, we might waste one slot.\n\nSimilarly, ""AFOOT"" has double O.\n\nWe know O is present, so we can use one O? But if we use two, we can test if there is more than one O.\n\nBut since we are early, we can stick to distinct letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ALOFT"".\n\nBut wait: we have tested A in position 1 (known) and O in position 3 (unknown). We also test L, F, T.\n\nAlternatively, we can put O in a different position? But we don\'t have many options.\n\nAnother word: ""ATOMS"" -> A, T, O, M, S. O at position 3. Tests T, O, M, S.\n\nBut ""ATOMS"" is a valid word. And all letters distinct? Yes: A, T, O, M, S.\n\nSimilarly, ""ATOMY"" -> not as common.\n\nOr ""AVOWS"" -> but O is at position 3? And V, O, W, S? And we test V, W, S. But ""AVOWS"" starts with A.\n\nBut ""ATOMS"" is a very common word.\n\nCompare ""ATOMS"" and ""ALOFT"":\n- Both start with A.\n- Both have O at position 3.\n- ""ATOMS"" tests T, O, M, S (and we know A and O are present, so we are testing T, M, S).\n- ""ALOFT"" tests L, O, F, T.\n\nWe haven\'t tested either set. Both are fine.\n\nSince S and T are very common in English, I\'ll go with ""ATOMS"" because it includes S and T.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had C and S? No, in ""crane"" we had C (absent), not S.\n\nS hasn\'t been tested yet. Similarly, T hasn\'t been tested.\n\nSo ""ATOMS"": A (known at position 1), T (new), O (known present), M (new), S (new).\n\nThis way we test three new letters: T, M, S.\n\nWe know that O is present and not at position 5, but we put it at position 3? So if O is actually at position 3, we get a check. If it\'s at position 2 or 4, we get a dash for O at position 3? And then we will know O is not at 3.\n\nSimilarly, if we put O at position 3 and it\'s not in the word? But we know O is present, so it will be either check or dash.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""ATOMS"".\n\nBut we must make sure that the word does not contain any absent letters? It doesn\'t: A, T, O, M, S — none of C,R,N,E,U,D,I.\n\nSo ""ATOMS"" is valid.\n\nTherefore, my third guess is ""ATOMS"".\n\n<guess>atoms</guess>Based on the feedback from the first two guesses:  \n- **Guess 1:** ""crane"" → `C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)`  \n  - `C`, `R`, `N`, `E` are **absent**.  \n  - `A` is **present** but **not in position 3** (since the feedback was `-` for position 3).  \n\n- **Guess 2:** ""audio"" → `A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)`  \n  - `A` is **correct at position 1** (✓).  \n  - `U`, `D`, `I` are **absent**.  \n  - `O` is **present** but **not in position 5** (since the feedback was `-` for position 5).  \n\n### Key Information:  \n1.

The letter \'O\' is present in the word, but not at position 3 (from ""atoms"") and not at position 5 (from ""audio""). Therefore, \'O\' must be at position 2 or 4.\n3.

The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, T, M, S.\n\nThe only present letters we know are A and O. Since we have two positions left (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) and we know O is in one of 2 or 4, and the other positions must be filled with letters we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nWe need to consider the remaining letters of the alphabet that haven\'t been tested: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, and we have A at position 1 and O at either 2 or 4.\n\nLet\'s consider the two cases:\n\nCase 1: O is at position 2.\nThen the word is: A O _ _ _\n\nCase 2: O is at position 4.\nThen the word is: A _ _ O _\n\nWe need to choose a word that includes O in either position 2 or 4 and uses new letters from the remaining set.\n\nWe also want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters from the remaining: L, P, H, G, B, F, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word that has O in position 2 and then test other common letters, or in position 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know which case, so we might choose a word that has O in position 4 to test that possibility, since we haven\'t tested position 4 for O yet? Actually, we haven\'t tested position 2 or 4 directly.\n\nIn ""audio"", O was at position 5 (wrong) and in ""atoms"", O was at position 3 (wrong). So positions 2 and 4 are still possible.\n\nWe can try a word with O at position 4 to see if it is correct there.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has O at position 2 to test that.\n\nBut we also need to test other letters.\n\nLet\'s list possible words that start with A, have O in position 2 or 4, and use only the available letters.\n\nFirst, with O at position 2: A O _ _ _\n\nWe need to fill the last three positions with letters from B, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, avoiding the absent letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- A O L L Y (ALLY) -> but that has double L? ""ALLY"" is 4 letters? ""ALLOY"" is 5 letters: A L L O Y -> but that has O at position 4, not 2.\n\nFor position 2: \n- ""AORTA"" -> but R and T are absent? R and T are absent, so invalid.\n- ""AOKAY"" -> not a word.\n- ""ABOUT"" -> U is absent.\n- ""ADOBE"" -> D and E absent.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a common word with O at position 2 without using absent letters.\n\nNow, with O at position 4: A _ _ O _\n\nPossible words:\n- ""ALBOW"" -> not common, but ""ELBOW"" is common but doesn\'t start with A.\n- ""ALLOW"" -> A L L O W -> but we have double L? And we haven\'t tested L or W. But note: we have to avoid absent letters. L and W are not in the absent list. So ""ALLOW"" is a candidate.\n\nBut ""ALLOW"" has O at position 4? Let\'s see: \nPosition 1: A\nPosition 2: L\nPosition 3: L\nPosition 4: O\nPosition 5: W\n\nSo O is at position 4.\n\nAnother word: ""ARROW"" -> but R is absent, and also double R? and O at position 4?

We need O at position 4? Actually, ""ALOHA"": A (1), L (2), O (3), H (4), A (5). So O is at position 3, which we already know is wrong (from ""atoms"", O not at 3). So we cannot use that.\n\nWe need O at position 4.\n\nAnother word: ""ALGAL"" -> not common and O not present.\n\n""ALGAE"" -> E absent.\n\n""ALIBI"" -> I absent.\n\n""ALKYL"" -> not common.\n\n""ALWAY"" -> not a word, but ""ALWAYS"" is 6 letters.\n\n""ALOW"" is not 5 letters.\n\nPerhaps ""ALLOW"" is the best candidate so far.\n\nAnother word: ""AVOW"" -> 4 letters.\n\n""AVOWS"" -> A V O W S -> but S is absent? S was marked absent in ""atoms"", so we cannot use S.\n\nSimilarly, ""ATOMS"" had S at position 5 and it was absent.\n\nSo we cannot use S.\n\nTherefore, ""ALLOW"" is a candidate: A, L, L, O, W.\n\nBut it has double L. That might be acceptable.\n\nAnother word: ""ALLOT"" -> A L L O T -> but T is absent? T was absent in ""atoms"", so we cannot use T.\n\nSo ""ALLOT"" is invalid.\n\n""ALLOY"" -> A L L O Y -> O is at position 4? Yes: A(1), L(2), L(3), O(4), Y(5). And we haven\'t tested L or Y. And Y is allowed.\n\nBut ""ALLOY"" has double L. We can use it to test L and Y.\n\nAnother word: ""ALOOF"" -> A L O O F -> O at position 3? We need position 4. ""ALOOF"": A(1), L(2), O(3), O(4), F(5). So O is at both 3 and 4. But we know O is not at position 3 (from ""atoms"" feedback: O at position 3 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning it is not at 3). So if we put O at position 3, we expect it to be marked as absent (if only one O) or as present but wrong position if there is another O? But we know the secret word has at least one O, but we don\'t know if it has two.\n\nHowever, we are trying to avoid position 3 for O because we know it\'s not there. So putting O at position 3 might not be efficient.\n\nBut in ""ALOOF"", we have O at position 3 and 4. We know position 3 is wrong, so that O will be marked as absent (if only one O) or as present but wrong position (if there is a second O). But we are more interested in position 4.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word without O at position 3.\n\nSo ""ALLOY"" is better: O at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""ALLOW"" has O at position 4.\n\nBut ""ALLOW"" uses W, and ""ALLOY"" uses Y.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nWe can also consider ""ALBUM"" -> but U and M are absent? U and M are absent (from ""audio"" and ""atoms""), so invalid.\n\n""ALPHA"" -> A L P H A -> O not present? We must include O because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot use a word without O.\n\nSo we must include O.\n\nTherefore, ""ALLOW"" and ""ALLOY"" are candidates.\n\nLet\'s choose ""ALLOY"" because it ends with Y, which is less common than W? But we don\'t know.\n\nWe can also consider words without double letters.\n\nIs there a word with O at position 4 and no double letters?\n\nFor example: ""AFLOW"" -> not a word.\n\n""AGLOW"" -> A G L O W -> O at position 4? A(1), G(2), L(3), O(4), W(5). And all distinct letters? Yes: A, G, L, O, W.\n\nAnd we haven\'t tested G, L, W.\n\nAlso, avoids absent letters.\n\n""AGLOW"" is a word meaning glowing.\n\nSimilarly, ""AGLOW"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""ABLOW"" -> not common.\n\nSo ""AGLOW"" is a good candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""APTLY"" -> but T is absent.\n\nSo ""AGLOW"" seems better than ""ALLOW"" or ""ALLOY"" because it has distinct letters.\n\nWe can also consider ""AFOUL"" -> but U and F? U is absent, so invalid.\n\n""AFOOT"" -> O at position 3 and 4? And we know position 3 is wrong. Also, F and T: T is absent? T was absent in ""atoms"", so we cannot use T.\n\nSo ""AFOOT"" is invalid.\n\nTherefore, ""AGLOW"" is a good choice.\n\nWe can also consider ""ALGAL"" -> no O.\n\n""ALKYL"" -> no O.\n\nSo I think ""AGLOW"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: A G L O W.\n\nPosition 1: A (known correct)\nPosition 2: G (new)\nPosition 3: L (new)\nPosition 4: O (we want to test if O is at position 4)\nPosition 5: W (new)\n\nWe test three new letters: G, L, W.\n\nIf O is at position 4, we get a check for O. If not, we get a dash meaning O is present but not at 4, so it must be at position 2 (since positions 3 and 5 are already ruled out).\n\nSo we will know the position of O after this guess.\n\nAlso, we get information about G, L, W.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""AGLOW"".\n\nBut wait, is ""AGLOW"" a valid Wordle word? I believe it is.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""ALGAE"" but E is absent.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, fourth guess: ""AGLOW""\n\n<guess>aglow</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n\n1. **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)**  \n   - `C`, `R`, `N`, `E` are **absent** from the secret word.  \n   - `A` is **present** but **not in position 3**.  \n\n2. **Guess 2: ""audio"" → Feedback: A(✓) U(x) D(x) I(x) O(-)**  \n   - `A` is **correct at position 1** (secret word starts with `A`).  \n   - `U`, `D`, `I` are **absent**.  \n   - `O` is **present** but **not in position 5**.  \n\n3. **Guess 3: ""atoms"" → Feedback: A(✓) T(x) O(-) M(x) S(x)**  \n   - `A` is **correct at position 1** (reconfirms position 1).  \n   - `T`, `M`, `S` are **absent**.  \n   - `O` is **present** but **not in position 3**.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Secret word structure**: `A _ _ _ _` (position 1 is `A`).  \n- **Confirmed present letters**:  \n  - `A` (position 1).  \n  - `O` (must be in position 2 or 4, since positions 3 and 5 are ruled out).  \n- **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `N`, `E`, `U`, `D`, `I`, `T`, `M`, `S` (cannot be used).  \n- **Untested letters**: `B`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `J`, `K`, `L`, `P`, `Q`, `V`, `W`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`.  \n- **Goal for next guess**:  \n  - Test `O` in **position 4** (since position 2 is still untested for `O`, but position 4 is a strong candidate).  \n  - Introduce new high-frequency letters to gather more information (e.g., `L`, `G`, `W`).  \n  - Avoid absent letters and reuse of `A`/`O` in invalid positions.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- Choose a word that:  \n  - Starts with `A` (position 1).  \n  - Places `O` in **position 4** (to test if it is correct there; if not, `O` must be in position 2).  \n  - Uses new, common letters from the untested set (e.g., `G`, `L`, `W`).  \n- **Selected word: ""AGLOW""**  \n  - `A` (position 1): Confirmed correct.  \n  - `G` (position 2): New letter (tests a common consonant).  \n  - `L` (position 3): New letter (high-frequency consonant).  \n  - `O` (position 4): Tests if `O` is correctly placed here.  \n  - `W` (position 5): New letter (less common, but efficient for elimination).  \n- **Why ""AGLOW""?**  \n  - Maximizes information: Tests `O` in position 4 and three new letters (`G`, `L`, `W`).  \n  - If `O` is correct at position 4, we get a ✓.

We have the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  - So A is present but not at position 3.
  - C, R, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""audio"" -> A(✓), U(x), D(x), I(x), O(-)
  - A is correct at position 1.
  - O is present but not at position 5.
  - U, D, I are absent.

Guess 3: ""atoms"" -> A(✓), T(x), O(-), M(x), S(x)
  - A is correct at position 1 (reconfirms).
  - O is present but not at position 3.
  - T, M, S are absent.

Guess 4: ""aglow"" -> A(✓), G(x), L(✓), O(✓), W(✓)
  - A is correct at position 1.
  - G is absent (x).
  - L is correct at position 3 (✓).
  - O is correct at position 4 (✓).
  - W is correct at position 5 (✓).

So from the latest feedback, we have:
- Position 1: A (correct)
- Position 3: L (correct)
- Position 4: O (correct)
- Position 5: W (correct)
- And G is absent.

Also, from previous feedback, we know that the secret word has A at position 1, and now we know L at position 3, O at position 4, and W at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word is: A _ L O W

We are missing the second letter.

We also know the absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, T, M, S, G (from the feedbacks).

We have tested: A, C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, T, M, S, G, L, W.

L and W are now known to be in the word and in the correct positions.

The only position missing is position 2.

We need to find a letter for position 2 that:
- Is not in the absent list: so not C, R, N, E, U, D, I, T, M, S, G.
- And forms a valid English word with ""A_LOW"".

The word is of the form: A ? L O W

We know the word must be a 5-letter English word.

Possible letters for position 2: from the remaining alphabet, excluding absent letters.

The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, T, M, S, G.

The entire alphabet: A to Z.

We have used: A, C, D, E, G, I, L, M, N, O, R, S, T, U, W.

But note: A, L, O, W are in the word, so they are present. The others are absent.

Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to find a letter from these that can form a word with ""A_LOW"".

Common words:
- ALLOW: but we have L at position 3, so if we put L at position 2, it would be ""ALLOW"". But in ""aglow"", we tested L at position 3 and it was correct, but we didn't test position 2. However, in ""aglow"", we had G at position 2 which was absent, so position 2 is open.

But ""ALLOW"" has L at position 2 and 3? Let's see: A L L O W. But we already have L at position 3, so if we put L at position 2, that would be a double L.

Is that possible? The feedback from ""aglow"" doesn't rule out having L at position 2? Actually, in ""aglow"", we only tested L at position 3 and it was correct. We didn't test for L elsewhere.

But the secret word might have two L's? We don't know.

However, in the feedback for ""aglow"", we have:
- Position 1: A (correct)
- Position 2: G (absent) -> so the letter at position 2 is not G, and not any of the absent letters.
- Position 3: L (correct) -> so L is at position 3.
- Position 4: O (correct)
- Position 5: W (correct)

So the secret word is A ? L O W.

If we try ""ALLOW"", then the second letter is L, so the word would be A L L O W.

But we already know that position 3 is L, so if position 2 is also L, that's fine.

But is ""ALLOW"" a valid word? Yes.

But we need to check if L is allowed? We haven't been told that L is absent? In fact, we know L is present at position 3.

But we haven't tested L at position 2, so it could be.

However, we must consider if there are other possibilities.

Other words with A _ L O W:

- ""ALLOW"" (with L at position 2)
- Are there others?

Let's think: A B L O W? ""ABLOW"" is not a common word.

A F L O W? ""AFLOW"" is not a standard word? But ""flow"" is, but ""aflow"" might not be.

A H L O W? ""AHLOW"" not a word.

A J L O W? No.

A K L O W? ""AKLOW"" not a word.

A P L O W? ""APLOW"" not a word.

A Q L O W? No.

A V L O W? ""AVLOW"" not a word.

A X L O W? No.

A Y L O W? ""AYLOW"" not a word.

A Z L O W? No.

What about ""ALLOW"" with double L? That seems the only common word.

But is there ""ANLOW""? But N is absent.

Or ""ARLOW""? R is absent.

So ""ALLOW"" seems to be the only common word.

But we have to confirm: the word ""ALLOW"" has L at position 2 and L at position 3.

In our feedback, we know position 3 is L, and position 4 is O, position 5 is W, and position 1 is A.

So if the secret word is ""ALLOW"", then position 2 should be L.

But in our fourth guess ""aglow"", we had G at position 2 which was absent, so it didn't reveal anything about position 2.

Now, we need to guess the word. Since we have only one position left, and we have limited tries, we can guess ""ALLOW"".

But note: we have not tested if L can be at position 2. However, since we know L is in the word at position 3, it could potentially be at position 2 as well.

Alternatively, we can think of other words? What about ""ALOW""? But that's 4 letters.

Or ""ALLOW"" is the only 5-letter word that fits.

Another possibility: ""AVLOW"" is not a word. Or ""ALLOW"" is the only one.

But let me double-check: is there ""ABLOW""? No.

""ALLOW"" is the word.

But we must consider: in the first guess, we had A at position 3? But that was the secret word's A, which we now know is at position 1. And we have L at position 3.

So the word is A _ L O W.

With the blank being a letter not absent.

Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

But none of these form a common word with A _ L O W except if we use L? But L is already used, and we are allowed to use it again.

So ""ALLOW"" is the only common English word that fits.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""ALLOW"".

But let's verify with the feedback:

First guess ""crane"": 
- C: absent (correct, not in ALLOW)
- R: absent (correct, not in ALLOW)
- A: present but wrong position? In ""crane"", A was at position 3. In ""ALLOW"", A is at position 1, so it should have been marked as present but not at position 3? But in the feedback, it was marked as present but wrong position (-), which is correct because it's not at position 3.

But note: in ""crane"", A was at position 3, and the secret word has A at position 1, so it is present but not at position 3, so the dash is correct.

Second guess ""audio"":
- A: correct at position 1 (✓) -> correct.
- U: absent (correct, not in ALLOW)
- D: absent (correct)
- I: absent (correct)
- O: present but not at position 5? In ""audio"", O was at position 5. In ""ALLOW"", O is at position 4, so it should be marked as present but not at position 5, which it was (-).

Third guess ""atoms"":
- A: correct (✓)
- T: absent (correct, not in ALLOW)
- O: present but not at position 3? In ""atoms"", O was at position 3. In ""ALLOW"", O is at position 4, so it should be marked as present but not at position 3, which it was (-).
- M: absent (correct)
- S: absent (correct)

Fourth guess ""aglow"":
- A: correct (✓)
- G: absent (correct, not in ALLOW)
- L: correct at position 3 (✓) -> in ""aglow"", L was at position 3, and in ""ALLOW"", L is at position 3? Wait, in ""aglow"", the word is A G L O W, so position 3 is L. In ""ALLOW"", position 3 is L? Actually, in ""ALLOW"", positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:L, 4:O, 5:W. So position 3 is L, which matches. But in ""aglow"", we had L at position 3 and it was marked correct (✓), which is consistent because the secret word has L at position 3.

But in ""aglow"", we also have:
- O: at position 4, marked correct (✓) -> in ""ALLOW"", O is at position 4, correct.
- W: at position 5, marked correct (✓) -> in ""ALLOW"", W is at position 5, correct.

So all match.

Therefore, the secret word is ""ALLOW"".

But we have to make a guess. Since we have only one position to fill (position 2) and the only common word is ""ALLOW"", we should guess that.

But note: we have 6 tries, and this is the fifth guess? We can guess it.

So the next guess is ""ALLOW"".

But let's make sure: is there any other possibility?

For example, could the word be ""ABLOW""? But ""ABLOW"" is not a standard English word.

Similarly, ""AVLOW"", etc., are not words.

So ""ALLOW"" is the only common word.

Therefore, we guess ""ALLOW"".

   - `W` is **correct at position 5**.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: `A _ L O W` (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are confirmed as `A`, `L`, `O`, `W`).  
- **Missing letter**: Position 2 (unknown).  
- **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `N`, `E`, `U`, `D`, `I`, `T`, `M`, `S`, `G` (cannot be used).  
- **Available letters for position 2**: `B`, `F`, `H`, `J`, `K`, `P`, `Q`, `V`, `X`, `Y`, `Z` (untested letters).  
- **Deduction**:  
  - The only common English word fitting `A _ L O W` is **""ALLOW""** (with `L` at position 2).  
  - All other combinations (e.g., `AFLOW`, `ABLOW`) are invalid words.  
  - Feedback consistency:  
    - `A` is at position 1 (✓).  
    - `L` at position 3 (✓) and potentially position 2 (untested but valid).  
    - `O` at position 4 (✓).  
    - `W` at position 5 (✓).  
    - Absent letters (e.g., `G` in ""aglow"") are not in the word.  

### Guess 5: ""ALLOW""
- Tests the only feasible word: **A L L O W**.  
- If correct, all positions match.  
- If incorrect, it must be due to position 2, but no other valid words exist.

  - A is correct at position 1 (reconfirms).
  - O is present but not at position 3.
  - T, M, S are absent.

Guess 4: ""aglow"" -> A(✓), G(x), L(✓), O(✓), W(✓)
  - A is correct at position 1.
  - G is absent (x).
  - L is correct at position 3 (✓).
  - O is correct at position 4 (✓).
  - W is correct at position 5 (✓).

So from the latest feedback, we have:
- Position 1: A (correct)
- Position 3: L (correct)
- Position 4: O (correct)
- Position 5: W (correct)
- And G is absent.

Also, from previous feedback, we know that the secret word has A at position 1, and now we know L at position 3, O at position 4, and W at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word is: A _ L O W

We are missing the second letter.

We also know the absent letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, T, M, S, G (from the feedbacks).

We have tested: A, C, R, N, E, U, D, I, O, T, M, S, G, L, W.

L and W are now known to be in the word and in the correct positions.

The only position missing is position 2.

We need to find a letter for position 2 that:
- Is not in the absent list: so not C, R, N, E, U, D, I, T, M, S, G.
- And forms a valid English word with ""A_LOW"".

The word is of the form: A ? L O W

We know the word must be a 5-letter English word.

Possible letters for position 2: from the remaining alphabet, excluding absent letters.

The absent letters are: C, R, N, E, U, D, I, T, M, S, G.

The entire alphabet: A to Z.

We have used: A, C, D, E, G, I, L, M, N, O, R, S, T, U, W.

But note: A, L, O, W are in the word, so they are present. The others are absent.

Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to find a letter from these that can form a word with ""A_LOW"".

Common words:
- ALLOW: but we have L at position 3, so if we put L at position 2, it would be ""ALLOW"". But in ""aglow"", we tested L at position 3 and it was correct, but we didn't test position 2. However, in ""aglow"", we had G at position 2 which was absent, so position 2 is open.

But ""ALLOW"" has L at position 2 and 3? Let's see: A L L O W. But we already have L at position 3, so if we put L at position 2, that would be a double L.

Is that possible? The feedback from ""aglow"" doesn't rule out having L at position 2? Actually, in ""aglow"", we only tested L at position 3 and it was correct. We didn't test for L elsewhere.

But the secret word might have two L's? We don't know.

However, in the feedback for ""aglow"", we have:
- Position 1: A (correct)
- Position 2: G (absent) -> so the letter at position 2 is not G, and not any of the absent letters.
- Position 3: L (correct) -> so L is at position 3.
- Position 4: O (correct)
- Position 5: W (correct)

So the secret word is A ? L O W.

If we try ""ALLOW"", then the second letter is L, so the word would be A L L O W.

But we already know that position 3 is L, so if position 2 is also L, that's fine.

But is ""ALLOW"" a valid word? Yes.

But we need to check if L is allowed? We haven't been told that L is absent? In fact, we know L is present at position 3.

But we haven't tested L at position 2, so it could be.

However, we must consider if there are other possibilities.

Other words with A _ L O W:

- ""ALLOW"" (with L at position 2)
- Are there others?

Let's think: A B L O W? ""ABLOW"" is not a common word.

A F L O W? ""AFLOW"" is not a standard word? But ""flow"" is, but ""aflow"" might not be.

A H L O W? ""AHLOW"" not a word.

A J L O W? No.

A K L O W? ""AKLOW"" not a word.

A P L O W? ""APLOW"" not a word.

A Q L O W? No.

A V L O W? ""AVLOW"" not a word.

A X L O W? No.

A Y L O W? ""AYLOW"" not a word.

A Z L O W? No.

What about ""ALLOW"" with double L? That seems the only common word.

But is there ""ANLOW""? But N is absent.

Or ""ARLOW""? R is absent.

So ""ALLOW"" seems to be the only common word.

But we have to confirm: the word ""ALLOW"" has L at position 2 and L at position 3.

In our feedback, we know position 3 is L, and position 4 is O, position 5 is W, and position 1 is A.

So if the secret word is ""ALLOW"", then position 2 should be L.

But in our fourth guess ""aglow"", we had G at position 2 which was absent, so it didn't reveal anything about position 2.

Now, we need to guess the word. Since we have only one position left, and we have limited tries, we can guess ""ALLOW"".

But note: we have not tested if L can be at position 2. However, since we know L is in the word at position 3, it could potentially be at position 2 as well.

Alternatively, we can think of other words? What about ""ALOW""? But that's 4 letters.

Or ""ALLOW"" is the only 5-letter word that fits.

Another possibility: ""AVLOW"" is not a word. Or ""ALLOW"" is the only one.

But let me double-check: is there ""ABLOW""? No.

""ALLOW"" is the word.

But we must consider: in the first guess, we had A at position 3? But that was the secret word's A, which we now know is at position 1. And we have L at position 3.

So the word is A _ L O W.

With the blank being a letter not absent.

Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

But none of these form a common word with A _ L O W except if we use L? But L is already used, and we are allowed to use it again.

So ""ALLOW"" is the only common English word that fits.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""ALLOW"".

But let's verify with the feedback:

First guess ""crane"": 
- C: absent (correct, not in ALLOW)
- R: absent (correct, not in ALLOW)
- A: present but wrong position? In ""crane"", A was at position 3. In ""ALLOW"", A is at position 1, so it should have been marked as present but not at position 3? But in the feedback, it was marked as present but wrong position (-), which is correct because it's not at position 3.

But note: in ""crane"", A was at position 3, and the secret word has A at position 1, so it is present but not at position 3, so the dash is correct.

Second guess ""audio"":
- A: correct at position 1 (✓) -> correct.
- U: absent (correct, not in ALLOW)
- D: absent (correct)
- I: absent (correct)
- O: present but not at position 5? In ""audio"", O was at position 5. In ""ALLOW"", O is at position 4, so it should be marked as present but not at position 5, which it was (-).

Third guess ""atoms"":
- A: correct (✓)
- T: absent (correct, not in ALLOW)
- O: present but not at position 3? In ""atoms"", O was at position 3. In ""ALLOW"", O is at position 4, so it should be marked as present but not at position 3, which it was (-).
- M: absent (correct)
- S: absent (correct)

Fourth guess ""aglow"":
- A: correct (✓)
- G: absent (correct, not in ALLOW)
- L: correct at position 3 (✓) -> in ""aglow"", L was at position 3, and in ""ALLOW"", L is at position 3? Wait, in ""aglow"", the word is A G L O W, so position 3 is L. In ""ALLOW"", position 3 is L? Actually, in ""ALLOW"", positions: 1:A, 2:L, 3:L, 4:O, 5:W. So position 3 is L, which matches. But in ""aglow"", we had L at position 3 and it was marked correct (✓), which is consistent because the secret word has L at position 3.

But in ""aglow"", we also have:
- O: at position 4, marked correct (✓) -> in ""ALLOW"", O is at position 4, correct.
- W: at position 5, marked correct (✓) -> in ""ALLOW"", W is at position 5, correct.

So all match.

Therefore, the secret word is ""ALLOW"".

But we have to make a guess. Since we have only one position to fill (position 2) and the only common word is ""ALLOW"", we should guess that.

But note: we have 6 tries, and this is the fifth guess? We can guess it.

So the next guess is ""ALLOW"".

But let's make sure: is there any other possibility?

For example, could the word be ""ABLOW""? But ""ABLOW"" is not a standard English word.

Similarly, ""AVLOW"", etc., are not words.

So ""ALLOW"" is the only common word.

Therefore, we guess ""ALLOW"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word structure**: `A _ L O W` (positions 1, 3, 4, 5 are confirmed as `A`, `L`, `O`, `W`).  
- **Missing letter**: Position 2 (unknown).  
- **Absent letters**: `C`, `R`, `N`, `E`, `U`, `D`, `I`, `T`, `M`, `S`, `G` (cannot be used).  
- **Available letters for position 2**: `B`, `F`, `H`, `J`, `K`, `P`, `Q`, `V`, `X`, `Y`, `Z` (untested letters).  
- **Deduction**:  
  - The only common English word fitting `A _ L O W` is **""ALLOW""** (with `L` at position 2).  
  - All other combinations (e.g., `AFLOW`, `ABLOW`) are invalid words.  
  - Feedback consistency:  
    - `A` is at position 1 (✓).  
    - `L` at position 3 (✓) and potentially position 2 (untested but valid).  
    - `O` at position 4 (✓).  
    - `W` at position 5 (✓).  
    - Absent letters (e.g., `G` in ""aglow"") are not in the word.  

### Guess 5: ""ALLOW""
- Tests the only feasible word: **A L L O W**.  
- If correct, all positions match.  
- If incorrect, it must be due to position 2, but no other valid words exist.",Guess 5: allow -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(✓) L(✓) O(✓) W(✓),SUCCESS
