We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given the feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
 This means:
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
 - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
 - C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 So the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ E

 We know that the letters C, A, N are not in the word.

 For our next guess, we need to choose a 5-letter word that:
 1. Has R in the second position and E in the fifth position.
 2. Does not contain the letters C, A, or N.
 3. We should try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Since E and R are fixed, and positions 1, 3, and 4 are unknown.

 Common letters that might be in the word: We can try using other vowels and consonants.

 Let me think of words that fit ""_ R _ _ E"".

 Some examples: 
 - GRAPE: but A and E are already known? Wait, A was marked absent in the first guess, so we cannot use A.
   Also, G is a new letter, R is fixed, then P and E? But E is at the end. However, A is excluded so we skip.

 - PRICE: P in position 1, R in 2, I in 3, C? But C was marked absent, so C should not be used.

 Since we cannot use C, A, N, let's look for other words.

 Another word: ""BRINE"" - B in 1, R in 2, I in 3, N in 4? But N was absent, so we cannot use N.

 Avoid C, A, N.

 Another possibility: ""DRIVE"" - D in 1, R in 2, I in 3, V in 4, E in 5. But does it use any excluded letter? No.

 However, let me check if ""DRIVE"" is valid. Yes.

 Alternatively, ""TRITE"": T in 1, R in 2, I in 3, T in 4, E in 5. But T is new, and we have T twice? It's a valid word.

 We want to test new letters. ""DRIVE"" uses D, I, V, and E (known) and R (known). So new letters: D, I, V.

 Similarly, ""TRITE"" uses T, R, I, T (repeated T), E. New letters: T, I.

 But ""TRITE"" has two T's, which might not be efficient because we are trying to discover more letters.

 Another word: ""PRIME"" - P, R, I, M, E. No excluded letters. New letters: P, I, M.

 This seems good.

 We could also consider ""BRUTE"": B, R, U, T, E. New letters: B, U, T.

 But note that E is already known to be in the fifth position, so that's fine.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Another classic: ""ORATE""? But O is new? However, our pattern is ""_ R _ _ E"", so O can go in first position? Also, A is excluded, so we cannot use A.

 So ""ORATE"" is invalid because A is excluded.

 After considering, I think ""PRIME"" is a good choice because it tests P, I, M.

 Alternatively, ""GRIME"": G, R, I, M, E. Also uses G, I, M.

 But since G is less common than P? Or we can try.

 However, both are valid.

 Let me pick ""PRIME"".

 So the next guess is ""PRIME"".

- R is correct and in position 2 (✓)

The secret word has the pattern: `_ R _ _ E` and **excludes C, A, N**.  

For the second guess:  
- Must place R in position 2 and E in position 5  
- Avoid using C, A, N

     - I is not in the word (x).
     - M is not in the word (x).

- The word starts with P (since P is correct in position 1).
- The word has R in position 2 and E in position 5.

- The pattern is: P R _ _ E

We know the third and fourth letters cannot be any of the excluded letters: C, A, N, I, M.

Also, from the first guess, we had E in position 5, and now we have P in position 1.

We need to think of 5-letter words that start with ""PR"", end with ""E"", and have two more letters in the middle that are not C, A, N, I, M.

Common letters that might appear: We can try using other vowels (O, U) or consonants that haven't been tested yet.

Let's list possible words:

- The word must be of the form: P R ? ? E

Possible letters for the third and fourth positions: any letter except C, A, N, I, M (and we know P, R, E are already in the word, but they can repeat? However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicates, but we can't rule out duplicates yet. However, since we are avoiding excluded letters, we should focus on new letters.

We can try to use common letters that haven't been tested: like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

But we need to form valid English words.

Some possibilities:

- PROSE: P R O S E -> but we have E at the end, and O and S are new.
- PRONE: P R O N E -> but N is excluded (from first guess: N(x)), so we cannot use N.
- PROBE: P R O B E -> O and B are new.
- PRICE: P R I C E -> but I and C are excluded (I(x) in second guess, C(x) in first), so invalid.
- PRUNE: P R U N E -> N is excluded, so invalid.
- PROVE: P R O V E -> O and V are new.
- PRUDE: P R U D E -> U and D are new.

We need to avoid I, M, C, A, N.

So let's consider:

- PROSE: uses O and S. Both are new and not excluded.
- PROBE: uses O and B. New.
- PROVE: uses O and V. New.
- PRUDE: uses U and D. New.

But note: in ""PROSE"", the S and O are new. Similarly for others.

We want to maximize information. Since we have two positions to fill, we might want to test letters that are common and can appear in multiple contexts.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has letters we haven't tried yet.

But note: we have only two guesses so far, and we have excluded 5 letters (C, A, N, I, M). We have 21 letters left.

We can also consider that the word might have repeated letters, but so far we don't have evidence of that.

Let me think of common words that fit ""PR _ _ E"":

- PROSE (meaning: written or spoken language)
- PROBE (meaning: investigate)
- PRONE (but N is excluded)
- PRICE (but I and C excluded)
- PRUNE (N excluded)
- PROVE (meaning: demonstrate)
- PRUDE (meaning: overly proper person)
- PRATE (meaning: talk foolishly) -> but A is excluded (A(x) in first guess), so invalid.
- PROLE (meaning: proletarian) -> O and L, but L is new.

So valid options: PROSE, PROBE, PROVE, PRUDE, PROLE, etc.

We can also consider: PRESS -> but S is repeated? And the pattern is PR_ _ E, so ""PRESS"" would be P R E S S? But that has E in position 3, but we have E at the end? And also, we have two S's. But the pattern is P R ? ? E, so the fourth letter must be the last but one? So ""PRESS"" is P R E S S, which is 5 letters? Actually, ""PRESS"" is P-R-E-S-S, so positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:E, 4:S, 5:S. But we know that E is in position 5? Here position 5 is S, so that doesn't match. So invalid.

We must have E at the end.

So the word must end with E.

Therefore, the only possibilities are words with the pattern P R ? ? E.

Let me list some common ones that don't use excluded letters:

- PROSE: P R O S E
- PROBE: P R O B E
- PROVE: P R O V E
- PRUDE: P R U D E
- PROLE: P R O L E (less common, but valid)
- PRONE: invalid (N excluded)
- PRATE: invalid (A excluded)
- PRIZE: but I is excluded (I(x)), so invalid.
- PRIME: we already tried, and it had I and M which are excluded.

Another one: ""PROKE"" - not a common word? Probably not valid.

""PRASE"" - but A is excluded.

""PREZE"" - not a word.

So the main candidates are: PROSE, PROBE, PROVE, PRUDE.

We need to choose one that tests new letters.

We haven't tested: B, D, O, S, U, V, etc.

We can choose ""PROBE"" to test O and B.

Or ""PROSE"" to test O and S.

Or ""PROVE"" for O and V.

Or ""PRUDE"" for U and D.

Since we have two positions, we might want to cover more common letters.

O is a vowel and very common, so including O might be good.

Similarly, S is a very common consonant.

So ""PROSE"" might be a good choice because it tests O and S.

But note: in ""PROSE"", the O is in position 3 and S in position 4.

We can also consider that if we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a different vowel, like U, to see if it's present.

But O is more common.

Another idea: we know the word has E at the end, and R in the middle, and P at the start. The third and fourth letters are unknown.

We can also think of the word ""PRIDE"", but I is excluded, so no.

Or ""PRONE"", no.

So I think ""PROSE"" is a solid choice.

But let me check if there are other words: ""PROKE"" is not valid. ""PRYDE"" not a word. ""PRUNE"" has N.

So I'll go with ""PROSE"".

But wait, what about ""PROXY""? That's 5 letters? P R O X Y, but it doesn't end with E. So no.

Therefore, I choose ""PROSE"".

So the next guess is ""PROSE"".

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
     - R (position 2) is correct (✓), and E (position 5) is correct (✓).
     - C, A, N are absent (x). This means the secret word has the pattern `_ R _ _ E` and excludes C, A, N.
   - **Guess 2 (""prime"")**:
     - P (position 1) is correct (✓), R (position 2) is correct (✓), E (position 5) is correct (✓).
     - I and M are absent (x). This means the secret word starts with P, so the pattern is `P R _ _ E`, and it excludes I and M.

2. **Current Constraints**:
   - Secret word pattern: `P R _ _ E`.
   - Confirmed letters: P (position 1), R (position 2), E (position 5).
   - Excluded letters: C, A, N, I, M (from both guesses).
   - Unknown positions: 3 and 4 (must be filled with letters not excluded).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Focus on testing common letters for positions 3 and 4 that haven't been tried yet (e.g., O, S, B, D, U, V, L, T).
   - Avoid excluded letters (C, A, N, I, M).
   - Prioritize words that use high-frequency letters to maximize information gain.
   - Possible candidate words: 
     - `PROSE` (tests O and S)
     - `PROBE` (tests O and B)
     - `PROVE` (tests O and V)
     - `PRUDE` (tests U and D)
   - `PROSE` is chosen because:
     - It tests O (a common vowel) and S (a common consonant).
     - Both letters are new and not excluded.
     - It is a valid English word that fits the pattern `P R _ _ E`.

4. **Expected Outcome**:
   - If feedback shows O or S as correct (✓) or misplaced (-), it will help narrow down the remaining letters for positions 3 and 4.
   - If both are absent (x), it eliminates two common letters, reducing possibilities for future guesses.

<guess>prose</guess>",prose,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   - This tells us:
     - R is in the word and in position 2.
     - E is in the word and in position 5.
     - C, A, N are not in the word at all.
   - So the word pattern is: _ R _ _ E

2. Guess 2: ""prime"" -> P(✓), R(✓), I(x), M(x), E(✓)
   - Feedback:
     - P is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
     - R is correct and in position 2 (we already knew that).
     - I is not in the word (x).
     - M is not in the word (x).
     - E is correct and in position 5 (we already knew that).

So now we know:
- The word starts with P (since P is correct in position 1).
- The word has R in position 2 and E in position 5.
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, I, M (from the x's in both guesses).
- The pattern is: P R _ _ E

We need to fill in the third and fourth letters.

We know the third and fourth letters cannot be any of the excluded letters: C, A, N, I, M.

- PRUNE: P R U N E -> N is excluded, so invalid.
- PROVE: P R O V E -> O and V are new.
- PRUDE: P R U D E -> U and D are new.

We need to avoid I, M, C, A, N.

So let's consider:

- PROSE: uses O and S. Both are new and not excluded.

We must have E at the end.

So the word must end with E.

- PRONE: invalid (N excluded)
- PRATE: invalid (A excluded)
- PRIZE: but I is excluded (I(x)), so invalid.
- PRIME: we already tried, and it had I and M which are excluded.

Another one: ""PROKE"" - not a common word? Probably not valid.

""PRASE"" - but A is excluded.

""PREZE"" - not a word.
