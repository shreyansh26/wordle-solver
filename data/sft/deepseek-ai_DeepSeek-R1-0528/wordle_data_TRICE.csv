We are starting the game and need to make the first guess. There's no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that maximizes the information gained (i.e., covers common letters and multiple positions).

A common starting word in similar word games is ""CRANE"" because it includes common letters and covers multiple vowels and consonants. However, note that the game has only 5-letter words and the feedback includes three symbols: ✓ for correct letter and position, - for correct letter wrong position, and x for absent.

Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a statistical choice based on letter frequency. But since this is the first guess, any word that covers common letters is acceptable.

Aim for words that have:
- Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y)
- Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

One classic starting word is ""SLATE"", which has two vowels (A,E) and three common consonants (S,L,T). Another is ""CRANE"".

But note: the example given in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We don't want to use the secret word from the example (BRISK) as a first guess because it is unknown.

I choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E'. 
- These letters are quite common.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is another good starter because it has two vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). But ""CRANE"" is fine.

Let's go with ""CRANE"".

Note: We are only allowed to guess valid English words.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

I am starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I'll choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants. A strategic first guess like ""CRANE"" works well because it:

- Helps identify letter positions efficiently
- Is a valid 5-letter English word

We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: (-) meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R: (✓) meaning R is in the correct position (so the second letter is R).
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
- N: (x) meaning N is not in the word.
- E: (✓) meaning E is in the correct position (so the fifth letter is E).

Therefore, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The word contains the letter C, but not in the first position (since we had C in the first position and it was marked as wrong position).
- The word does not contain A or N.

Also, note that the word has 5 letters and is an English word.

So, the current known pattern is: _ R _ _ E

We also know that the word contains C (but not in the first position). So C must be in one of the positions 3 or 4 (since position 2 is R and position 5 is E, and position 1 is not C).

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to include other common letters to uncover more of the word, while also respecting the known constraints.

Constraints for the new guess:
- Must be a 5-letter English word.
- Must not contain A or N (since they are not in the secret word).
- Should include C in a position that is not the first (so we can test positions 3 or 4) and also include other letters that are likely.

But note: we are not required to use the same letters. We are trying to find the secret word.

We also know that the secret word has an R in the second position and E at the end, and it has a C somewhere in the middle (positions 3 or 4).

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ E and have a C in the third or fourth position.

Possible words:
- If C is in the third position: then pattern is _ R C _ E. Examples: ""force"", ""trace"" (but trace has A which is excluded), ""price"", ""grace"" (has A), ""brice"" (not common). 
  But note: we cannot use A, so words with A are invalid for the secret word, but we can use them as guesses? Actually, the guess must be a valid English word, but it can contain letters we know are not in the secret word? 
  The rules say: ""Each guess must be a valid 5-letter English word."" It doesn't say we cannot use letters that are not in the secret word. However, using a letter we know is not in the secret word (like A) might not be efficient because it will be marked as 'x' and we don't gain new information about other letters.

So, to maximize information, we should avoid using letters we know are not in the word (A and N). Also, we already know C, R, E are in the word. We need to find the other two letters.

We know the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we don't have information about duplicates yet.

But in the feedback for CRANE, we had two correct (R and E) and one misplaced (C). The other two (A and N) are absent. So the secret word has at least the letters R, E, and C. And two more letters.

We can try to think of words that fit: _ R _ _ E, and contain C, and without A and N.

Let me list some possibilities:
- Position 3: if C is in position 3: _ R C _ E. Then the word must have two more letters: one in position 1 and one in position 4.
  Examples: 
    force (F in 1, O in 4) -> but O is a new letter.
    price (P in 1, I in 4)
    trice (T in 1, I in 4) -> but we haven't tested T or I.
    brice (B in 1, I in 4) -> but ""brice"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be a name, but we need common words.

- Position 4: if C is in position 4: _ R _ C E. Then the word has pattern _ R _ C E.
  Examples:
    trace (but has A, excluded) -> invalid for secret word, but we can guess it? We shouldn't because we know A is not in the secret word and we want to test other letters.
    grace (has A) -> same issue.
    force? No, force has C in position 3, not 4.
    Actually, let me think: words ending with ""CE"" and having R in the second position. 
    Examples: ""arise"" -> but no C and has A. 
    ""urge"" is 4 letters. 
    ""price"" has C in position 4? No, P-R-I-C-E -> so C is in position 4? Actually, in ""price"", the letters are: P (1), R (2), I (3), C (4), E (5). So that fits the pattern if we put C in position 4? But wait, in the pattern _ R _ C E, that would be: position1: ?, position2: R, position3: ?, position4: C, position5: E. So ""price"" is P in 1, R in 2, I in 3, C in 4, E in 5 -> so it fits the pattern with C in position 4.

But note: in our first guess, we had C in position 1 and it was misplaced. So in the secret word, C cannot be in position 1, but it can be in position 4. Similarly, it can be in position 3.

So both ""price"" (with C in position 4) and ""force"" (with C in position 3) are possible.

But we don't know which one. Also, we need to test other letters.

We have two unknown positions: position 1 and position 3 (if C is in 4) or position 1 and position 4 (if C is in 3). Actually, if C is in position 3, then we have position 1 and 4 unknown. If C is in position 4, then we have position 1 and 3 unknown.

We also have two more letters to discover.

We should choose a guess that can help us determine the position of C and also test other common letters.

Idea: use a word that has C in a different position than the first, and also includes other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we know A and N are out.

Common vowels: O, I, U (but E is already in, and A is out). Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

We can try to use a word that has the known letters (R and E) in the same positions to confirm, and also put C in a position we are testing (say position 3 or 4) and then use other new letters.

But note: we are allowed to reuse the same word? We are making a new guess.

Alternatively, we can avoid using R and E in the same positions? But we know they are correct, so if we change them, we might get less information. Actually, we can use them to confirm, but the feedback will show they are correct again.

But to test more letters, we might want to use a word that has R and E in the same positions (so we don't waste those) and then use the other positions to test new letters.

So, pattern for guess: _ R _ _ E

We must include C in either position 3 or 4? Actually, we don't have to, but we know C is in the word, so we can put it in a position we suspect.

But we have two possibilities for C: position 3 or 4. We can design a guess that tests one of these and also tests other letters.

Let me propose: ""PRICE""

Why?
- It has P (new letter) in position 1.
- R in position 2 (correct, so we expect a check).
- I (new vowel) in position 3.
- C in position 4 (we are testing if C is in position 4).
- E in position 5 (correct, so we expect a check).

If the secret word has C in position 4, then we will get C as correct (✓). If not, then we might get C as misplaced (-) or if it's in position 3, then we get misplaced for C? But note: if the secret word has C in position 3, then in ""PRICE"", the C is in position 4, which is wrong, so it would be marked as (-) if the secret word has a C and it's not in position 4? But we know the secret word has a C, so if it's not in position 4, then it must be in position 3 (since position 1 is not allowed and position 2 is R and position 5 is E). So if we get C as (-), then we know C is in position 3. If we get C as (✓), then it's in position 4.

Also, we test P and I.

Alternatively, we could use ""FORCE"":
- F in position 1.
- O in position 4 (if we put C in position 3) -> pattern: F O R C E? No, ""force"" is F(1), O(2)? Wait, no: force is F, O, R, C, E -> so position2 is O, but we know position2 must be R? That's a problem.

Wait, in ""force"", the second letter is O, but we know the second letter of the secret word is R. So we cannot use ""force"" because it has O in position 2, but we need R in position 2.

So we must have R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Therefore, the guess must have R in position 2 and E in position 5.

So, for the pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] E

We can put C in position3 or position4.

Option 1: put C in position3: then the guess is [letter1] R C [letter4] E. We need to choose letter1 and letter4 that are not A or N, and form a valid word.

Examples: 
  price -> wait, price has C in position4? Let me spell: P-R-I-C-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:E -> so C is in position4, not 3.

To have C in position3: we need words like: 
  trace -> but has A (excluded) and also A is not allowed, so invalid for our purpose? But we can use it as a guess? We know A is not in the secret word, so if we use ""trace"", we get A as 'x'. But we want to avoid known absent letters to test new ones.

Better to use a word without A or N.

What about ""brice""? But ""brice"" is not a common word. Let me check: it might be accepted? But we should stick to common words.

Another word: ""trice"" -> T-R-I-C-E -> that's T in 1, R in 2, I in 3, C in 4, E in 5 -> so C is in position4 again.

To have C in position3, we need the pattern: [letter1] R C [letter4] E.

What words have that? 
  ""force"" is F-O-R-C-E -> that's O in position2, not R. So no.

  ""arced"" -> has A and not R in position2.

  ""orcae"" -> not common and has O in position2.

  Actually, I cannot think of a common word with pattern _ R C _ E. 

What about ""circa""? But that's 5 letters? C-I-R-C-A -> but that ends with A, not E, and the pattern is not _ R _ _ E.

Alternatively, maybe there is no common word with the pattern _ R C _ E? 

Let me try: 
  ""mercy"" -> M-E-R-C-Y -> but position2 is E, not R.

  ""porch"" -> P-O-R-C-H -> but ends with H, not E.

  ""torch"" -> same.

  ""farce"" -> F-A-R-C-E -> has A and position2 is A? No, F(1), A(2), R(3) -> not R in position2.

So it seems difficult to find a word with _ R C _ E.

Therefore, perhaps C is in position4? Then pattern: _ R _ C E.

Words: 
  price (P-R-I-C-E)
  trice (T-R-I-C-E)
  brice (B-R-I-C-E) - less common
  urcei? not common.

Also, ""force"" doesn't fit because it has O in position2.

Another word: ""grace"" but has A.

""trace"" has A.

So without A, we have ""price"", ""trice"", and maybe ""brice"". 

But ""price"" is a common word.

So let's use ""PRICE"" as the next guess.

It tests:
- P in position1: if P is in the word and correct, we get ✓; if in the word but wrong position, we get -; if not, we get x.
- R in position2: we know it's correct, so we expect ✓.
- I in position3: tests if I is in the word and in that position.
- C in position4: we are testing if C is in position4 (if ✓ then yes, if - then it must be in position3 because we know C is in the word and not in position1, and position2 and 5 are taken by R and E).
- E in position5: we know it's correct, so ✓.

This guess will help us determine the position of C and also test P and I.

If we get feedback that C is ✓ in position4, then we know the pattern is _ R _ C E, and we have two letters left: position1 and position3.

If C is - in position4, then we know C is in position3 (because that's the only other possibility), so the pattern is _ R C _ E, and we have to find position1 and position4.

So either way, we narrow down.

Therefore, I choose ""PRICE"" as the next guess.

But note: we must not use letters we know are absent? We are allowed, but it's inefficient. However, in this case, we are not using A or N, so it's okay.

So the guess is ""PRICE"".

But wait, what if the secret word is ""CRWTH""? But that doesn't have E at the end? We know the fifth letter is E. So it must end with E.

Another possibility: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

So, let's go with ""PRICE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (misplaced, marked as ""-"").
- R is correct and in position 2 (marked as ""✓"").
- A is not in the word (marked as ""x"").
- N is not in the word (marked as ""x"").
- E is correct and in position 5 (marked as ""✓"").

Key insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E (position 2 is R, position 5 is E).
- The word contains C, but not in position 1. Since positions 2 and 5 are fixed, C must be in position 3 or 4.
- A and N are eliminated; they cannot appear in the word.
- The goal of the second guess is to:
  - Confirm the position of C (by testing it in position 4).
  - Test new common letters (P and I) to gather more information.
  - Avoid using A or N.

The word ""PRICE"" fits well because:
- It maintains R in position 2 and E in position 5 (expected to be correct).
- It places C in position 4 (to test if C is in position 4 or 3).
- It introduces P (position 1) and I (position 3), which are common letters not yet tested.
- It is a valid 5-letter word without A or N.

If C is in position 4, it will be marked ""✓""; if in position 3, it will be marked ""-"" (since position 4 would be wrong). This will help narrow down the pattern for the next guess.

<guess>PRICE</guess>",PRICE,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: (-) meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R: (✓) meaning R is in the correct position (so the second letter is R).
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
- N: (x) meaning N is not in the word.
- E: (✓) meaning E is in the correct position (so the fifth letter is E).

Therefore, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The word contains the letter C, but not in the first position (since we had C in the first position and it was marked as wrong position).
- The word does not contain A or N.

Also, note that the word has 5 letters and is an English word.

So, the current known pattern is: _ R _ _ E

We also know that the word contains C (but not in the first position). So C must be in one of the positions 3 or 4 (since position 2 is R and position 5 is E, and position 1 is not C).

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ E and have a C in the third or fourth position.

Possible words:
- If C is in the third position: then pattern is _ R C _ E. Examples: ""force"", ""trace"" (but trace has A which is excluded), ""price"", ""grace"" (has A), ""brice"" (not common). 
  But note: we cannot use A, so words with A are invalid for the secret word, but we can use them as guesses? Actually, the guess must be a valid English word, but it can contain letters we know are not in the secret word? 
  The rules say: ""Each guess must be a valid 5-letter English word."" It doesn't say we cannot use letters that are not in the secret word. However, using a letter we know is not in the secret word (like A) might not be efficient because it will be marked as 'x' and we don't gain new information about other letters.

So, to maximize information, we should avoid using letters we know are not in the word (A and N). Also, we already know C, R, E are in the word. We need to find the other two letters.

We know the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we don't have information about duplicates yet.

But in the feedback for CRANE, we had two correct (R and E) and one misplaced (C). The other two (A and N) are absent. So the secret word has at least the letters R, E, and C. And two more letters.

We can try to think of words that fit: _ R _ _ E, and contain C, and without A and N.

Let me list some possibilities:
- Position 3: if C is in position 3: _ R C _ E. Then the word must have two more letters: one in position 1 and one in position 4.
  Examples: 
    force (F in 1, O in 4) -> but O is a new letter.
    price (P in 1, I in 4)
    trice (T in 1, I in 4) -> but we haven't tested T or I.
    brice (B in 1, I in 4) -> but ""brice"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be a name, but we need common words.

- Position 4: if C is in position 4: _ R _ C E. Then the word has pattern _ R _ C E.
  Examples:
    trace (but has A, excluded) -> invalid for secret word, but we can guess it? We shouldn't because we know A is not in the secret word and we want to test other letters.
    grace (has A) -> same issue.
    force? No, force has C in position 3, not 4.
    Actually, let me think: words ending with ""CE"" and having R in the second position. 
    Examples: ""arise"" -> but no C and has A. 
    ""urge"" is 4 letters. 
    ""price"" has C in position 4? No, P-R-I-C-E -> so C is in position 4? Actually, in ""price"", the letters are: P (1), R (2), I (3), C (4), E (5). So that fits the pattern if we put C in position 4? But wait, in the pattern _ R _ C E, that would be: position1: ?, position2: R, position3: ?, position4: C, position5: E. So ""price"" is P in 1, R in 2, I in 3, C in 4, E in 5 -> so it fits the pattern with C in position 4.

But note: in our first guess, we had C in position 1 and it was misplaced. So in the secret word, C cannot be in position 1, but it can be in position 4. Similarly, it can be in position 3.

So both ""price"" (with C in position 4) and ""force"" (with C in position 3) are possible.

But we don't know which one. Also, we need to test other letters.

We have two unknown positions: position 1 and position 3 (if C is in 4) or position 1 and position 4 (if C is in 3). Actually, if C is in position 3, then we have position 1 and 4 unknown. If C is in position 4, then we have position 1 and 3 unknown.

We also have two more letters to discover.

We should choose a guess that can help us determine the position of C and also test other common letters.

Idea: use a word that has C in a different position than the first, and also includes other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we know A and N are out.

Common vowels: O, I, U (but E is already in, and A is out). Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

We can try to use a word that has the known letters (R and E) in the same positions to confirm, and also put C in a position we are testing (say position 3 or 4) and then use other new letters.

But note: we are allowed to reuse the same word? We are making a new guess.

Alternatively, we can avoid using R and E in the same positions? But we know they are correct, so if we change them, we might get less information. Actually, we can use them to confirm, but the feedback will show they are correct again.

But to test more letters, we might want to use a word that has R and E in the same positions (so we don't waste those) and then use the other positions to test new letters.

So, pattern for guess: _ R _ _ E

We must include C in either position 3 or 4? Actually, we don't have to, but we know C is in the word, so we can put it in a position we suspect.

But we have two possibilities for C: position 3 or 4. We can design a guess that tests one of these and also tests other letters.

Let me propose: ""PRICE""

Why?
- It has P (new letter) in position 1.
- R in position 2 (correct, so we expect a check).
- I (new vowel) in position 3.
- C in position 4 (we are testing if C is in position 4).
- E in position 5 (correct, so we expect a check).

If the secret word has C in position 4, then we will get C as correct (✓). If not, then we might get C as misplaced (-) or if it's in position 3, then we get misplaced for C? But note: if the secret word has C in position 3, then in ""PRICE"", the C is in position 4, which is wrong, so it would be marked as (-) if the secret word has a C and it's not in position 4? But we know the secret word has a C, so if it's not in position 4, then it must be in position 3 (since position 1 is not allowed and position 2 is R and position 5 is E). So if we get C as (-), then we know C is in position 3. If we get C as (✓), then it's in position 4.

Also, we test P and I.

Alternatively, we could use ""FORCE"":
- F in position 1.
- O in position 4 (if we put C in position 3) -> pattern: F O R C E? No, ""force"" is F(1), O(2)? Wait, no: force is F, O, R, C, E -> so position2 is O, but we know position2 must be R? That's a problem.

Wait, in ""force"", the second letter is O, but we know the second letter of the secret word is R. So we cannot use ""force"" because it has O in position 2, but we need R in position 2.

So we must have R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Therefore, the guess must have R in position 2 and E in position 5.

So, for the pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] E

We can put C in position3 or position4.

Option 1: put C in position3: then the guess is [letter1] R C [letter4] E. We need to choose letter1 and letter4 that are not A or N, and form a valid word.

Examples: 
  price -> wait, price has C in position4? Let me spell: P-R-I-C-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:E -> so C is in position4, not 3.

To have C in position3: we need words like: 
  trace -> but has A (excluded) and also A is not allowed, so invalid for our purpose? But we can use it as a guess? We know A is not in the secret word, so if we use ""trace"", we get A as 'x'. But we want to avoid known absent letters to test new ones.

Better to use a word without A or N.

What about ""brice""? But ""brice"" is not a common word. Let me check: it might be accepted? But we should stick to common words.

Another word: ""trice"" -> T-R-I-C-E -> that's T in 1, R in 2, I in 3, C in 4, E in 5 -> so C is in position4 again.

To have C in position3, we need the pattern: [letter1] R C [letter4] E.

What words have that? 
  ""force"" is F-O-R-C-E -> that's O in position2, not R. So no.

  ""arced"" -> has A and not R in position2.

  ""orcae"" -> not common and has O in position2.

  Actually, I cannot think of a common word with pattern _ R C _ E. 

What about ""circa""? But that's 5 letters? C-I-R-C-A -> but that ends with A, not E, and the pattern is not _ R _ _ E.

Alternatively, maybe there is no common word with the pattern _ R C _ E? 

Let me try: 
  ""mercy"" -> M-E-R-C-Y -> but position2 is E, not R.

  ""porch"" -> P-O-R-C-H -> but ends with H, not E.

  ""torch"" -> same.

  ""farce"" -> F-A-R-C-E -> has A and position2 is A? No, F(1), A(2), R(3) -> not R in position2.

So it seems difficult to find a word with _ R C _ E.

Therefore, perhaps C is in position4? Then pattern: _ R _ C E.

Words: 
  price (P-R-I-C-E)
  trice (T-R-I-C-E)
  brice (B-R-I-C-E) - less common
  urcei? not common.

Also, ""force"" doesn't fit because it has O in position2.

Another word: ""grace"" but has A.

""trace"" has A.

So without A, we have ""price"", ""trice"", and maybe ""brice"". 

But ""price"" is a common word.

So let's use ""PRICE"" as the next guess.

It tests:
- P in position1: if P is in the word and correct, we get ✓; if in the word but wrong position, we get -; if not, we get x.
- R in position2: we know it's correct, so we expect ✓.
- I in position3: tests if I is in the word and in that position.
- C in position4: we are testing if C is in position4 (if ✓ then yes, if - then it must be in position3 because we know C is in the word and not in position1, and position2 and 5 are taken by R and E).
- E in position5: we know it's correct, so ✓.

This guess will help us determine the position of C and also test P and I.

If we get feedback that C is ✓ in position4, then we know the pattern is _ R _ C E, and we have two letters left: position1 and position3.

If C is - in position4, then we know C is in position3 (because that's the only other possibility), so the pattern is _ R C _ E, and we have to find position1 and position4.

So either way, we narrow down.

Therefore, I choose ""PRICE"" as the next guess.

But note: we must not use letters we know are absent? We are allowed, but it's inefficient. However, in this case, we are not using A or N, so it's okay.

So the guess is ""PRICE"".

But wait, what if the secret word is ""CRWTH""? But that doesn't have E at the end? We know the fifth letter is E. So it must end with E.

Another possibility: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

So, let's go with ""PRICE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (misplaced, marked as ""-"").
- R is correct and in position 2 (marked as ""✓"").
- A is not in the word (marked as ""x"").
- N is not in the word (marked as ""x"").
- E is correct and in position 5 (marked as ""✓"").

Key insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E (position 2 is R, position 5 is E).
- The word contains C, but not in position 1. Since positions 2 and 5 are fixed, C must be in position 3 or 4.
- A and N are eliminated; they cannot appear in the word.
- The goal of the second guess is to:
  - Confirm the position of C (by testing it in position 4).
  - Test new common letters (P and I) to gather more information.
  - Avoid using A or N.

The word ""PRICE"" fits well because:
- It maintains R in position 2 and E in position 5 (expected to be correct).
- It places C in position 4 (to test if C is in position 4 or 3).
- It introduces P (position 1) and I (position 3), which are common letters not yet tested.
- It is a valid 5-letter word without A or N.

If C is in position 4, it will be marked ""✓""; if in position 3, it will be marked ""-"" (since position 4 would be wrong). This will help narrow down the pattern for the next guess.",Guess 2: PRICE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) I(✓) C(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,TRICE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game and need to make the first guess. There's no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that maximizes the information gained (i.e., covers common letters and multiple positions).

A common starting word in similar word games is ""CRANE"" because it includes common letters and covers multiple vowels and consonants. However, note that the game has only 5-letter words and the feedback includes three symbols: ✓ for correct letter and position, - for correct letter wrong position, and x for absent.

Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a statistical choice based on letter frequency. But since this is the first guess, any word that covers common letters is acceptable.

Aim for words that have:
- Common vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y)
- Common consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

One classic starting word is ""SLATE"", which has two vowels (A,E) and three common consonants (S,L,T). Another is ""CRANE"".

But note: the example given in the rules used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". We don't want to use the secret word from the example (BRISK) as a first guess because it is unknown.

I choose ""CRANE"" because:
- It has 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'E'. 
- These letters are quite common.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" is another good starter because it has two vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). But ""CRANE"" is fine.

Let's go with ""CRANE"".

Note: We are only allowed to guess valid English words.

So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".I am starting the game and need to make my first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I'll choose a word that maximizes information gain by including common vowels and consonants. A strategic first guess like ""CRANE"" works well because it:
- Covers 3 common vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N)
- Helps identify letter positions efficiently
- Is a valid 5-letter English word

This sets me up for useful feedback without repetition risk.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: (-) meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R: (✓) meaning R is in the correct position (so the second letter is R).
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.
- N: (x) meaning N is not in the word.
- E: (✓) meaning E is in the correct position (so the fifth letter is E).

Therefore, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The word contains the letter C, but not in the first position (since we had C in the first position and it was marked as wrong position).
- The word does not contain A or N.

Also, note that the word has 5 letters and is an English word.

So, the current known pattern is: _ R _ _ E

We also know that the word contains C (but not in the first position). So C must be in one of the positions 3 or 4 (since position 2 is R and position 5 is E, and position 1 is not C).

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to include other common letters to uncover more of the word, while also respecting the known constraints.

Constraints for the new guess:
- Must be a 5-letter English word.
- Must not contain A or N (since they are not in the secret word).
- Should include C in a position that is not the first (so we can test positions 3 or 4) and also include other letters that are likely.

But note: we are not required to use the same letters. We are trying to find the secret word.

We also know that the secret word has an R in the second position and E at the end, and it has a C somewhere in the middle (positions 3 or 4).

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ E and have a C in the third or fourth position.

Possible words:
- If C is in the third position: then pattern is _ R C _ E. Examples: ""force"", ""trace"" (but trace has A which is excluded), ""price"", ""grace"" (has A), ""brice"" (not common). 
  But note: we cannot use A, so words with A are invalid for the secret word, but we can use them as guesses? Actually, the guess must be a valid English word, but it can contain letters we know are not in the secret word? 
  The rules say: ""Each guess must be a valid 5-letter English word."" It doesn't say we cannot use letters that are not in the secret word. However, using a letter we know is not in the secret word (like A) might not be efficient because it will be marked as 'x' and we don't gain new information about other letters.

So, to maximize information, we should avoid using letters we know are not in the word (A and N). Also, we already know C, R, E are in the word. We need to find the other two letters.

We know the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we don't have information about duplicates yet.

But in the feedback for CRANE, we had two correct (R and E) and one misplaced (C). The other two (A and N) are absent. So the secret word has at least the letters R, E, and C. And two more letters.

We can try to think of words that fit: _ R _ _ E, and contain C, and without A and N.

Let me list some possibilities:
- Position 3: if C is in position 3: _ R C _ E. Then the word must have two more letters: one in position 1 and one in position 4.
  Examples: 
    force (F in 1, O in 4) -> but O is a new letter.
    price (P in 1, I in 4)
    trice (T in 1, I in 4) -> but we haven't tested T or I.
    brice (B in 1, I in 4) -> but ""brice"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be a name, but we need common words.

- Position 4: if C is in position 4: _ R _ C E. Then the word has pattern _ R _ C E.
  Examples:
    trace (but has A, excluded) -> invalid for secret word, but we can guess it? We shouldn't because we know A is not in the secret word and we want to test other letters.
    grace (has A) -> same issue.
    force? No, force has C in position 3, not 4.
    Actually, let me think: words ending with ""CE"" and having R in the second position. 
    Examples: ""arise"" -> but no C and has A. 
    ""urge"" is 4 letters. 
    ""price"" has C in position 4? No, P-R-I-C-E -> so C is in position 4? Actually, in ""price"", the letters are: P (1), R (2), I (3), C (4), E (5). So that fits the pattern if we put C in position 4? But wait, in the pattern _ R _ C E, that would be: position1: ?, position2: R, position3: ?, position4: C, position5: E. So ""price"" is P in 1, R in 2, I in 3, C in 4, E in 5 -> so it fits the pattern with C in position 4.

But note: in our first guess, we had C in position 1 and it was misplaced. So in the secret word, C cannot be in position 1, but it can be in position 4. Similarly, it can be in position 3.

So both ""price"" (with C in position 4) and ""force"" (with C in position 3) are possible.

But we don't know which one. Also, we need to test other letters.

We have two unknown positions: position 1 and position 3 (if C is in 4) or position 1 and position 4 (if C is in 3). Actually, if C is in position 3, then we have position 1 and 4 unknown. If C is in position 4, then we have position 1 and 3 unknown.

We also have two more letters to discover.

We should choose a guess that can help us determine the position of C and also test other common letters.

Idea: use a word that has C in a different position than the first, and also includes other common consonants and vowels that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we know A and N are out.

Common vowels: O, I, U (but E is already in, and A is out). Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.

We can try to use a word that has the known letters (R and E) in the same positions to confirm, and also put C in a position we are testing (say position 3 or 4) and then use other new letters.

But note: we are allowed to reuse the same word? We are making a new guess.

Alternatively, we can avoid using R and E in the same positions? But we know they are correct, so if we change them, we might get less information. Actually, we can use them to confirm, but the feedback will show they are correct again.

But to test more letters, we might want to use a word that has R and E in the same positions (so we don't waste those) and then use the other positions to test new letters.

So, pattern for guess: _ R _ _ E

We must include C in either position 3 or 4? Actually, we don't have to, but we know C is in the word, so we can put it in a position we suspect.

But we have two possibilities for C: position 3 or 4. We can design a guess that tests one of these and also tests other letters.

Let me propose: ""PRICE""

Why?
- It has P (new letter) in position 1.
- R in position 2 (correct, so we expect a check).
- I (new vowel) in position 3.
- C in position 4 (we are testing if C is in position 4).
- E in position 5 (correct, so we expect a check).

If the secret word has C in position 4, then we will get C as correct (✓). If not, then we might get C as misplaced (-) or if it's in position 3, then we get misplaced for C? But note: if the secret word has C in position 3, then in ""PRICE"", the C is in position 4, which is wrong, so it would be marked as (-) if the secret word has a C and it's not in position 4? But we know the secret word has a C, so if it's not in position 4, then it must be in position 3 (since position 1 is not allowed and position 2 is R and position 5 is E). So if we get C as (-), then we know C is in position 3. If we get C as (✓), then it's in position 4.

Also, we test P and I.

Alternatively, we could use ""FORCE"":
- F in position 1.
- O in position 4 (if we put C in position 3) -> pattern: F O R C E? No, ""force"" is F(1), O(2)? Wait, no: force is F, O, R, C, E -> so position2 is O, but we know position2 must be R? That's a problem.

Wait, in ""force"", the second letter is O, but we know the second letter of the secret word is R. So we cannot use ""force"" because it has O in position 2, but we need R in position 2.

So we must have R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Therefore, the guess must have R in position 2 and E in position 5.

So, for the pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] E

We can put C in position3 or position4.

Option 1: put C in position3: then the guess is [letter1] R C [letter4] E. We need to choose letter1 and letter4 that are not A or N, and form a valid word.

Examples: 
  price -> wait, price has C in position4? Let me spell: P-R-I-C-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:E -> so C is in position4, not 3.

To have C in position3: we need words like: 
  trace -> but has A (excluded) and also A is not allowed, so invalid for our purpose? But we can use it as a guess? We know A is not in the secret word, so if we use ""trace"", we get A as 'x'. But we want to avoid known absent letters to test new ones.

Better to use a word without A or N.

What about ""brice""? But ""brice"" is not a common word. Let me check: it might be accepted? But we should stick to common words.

Another word: ""trice"" -> T-R-I-C-E -> that's T in 1, R in 2, I in 3, C in 4, E in 5 -> so C is in position4 again.

To have C in position3, we need the pattern: [letter1] R C [letter4] E.

What words have that? 
  ""force"" is F-O-R-C-E -> that's O in position2, not R. So no.

  ""arced"" -> has A and not R in position2.

  ""orcae"" -> not common and has O in position2.

  Actually, I cannot think of a common word with pattern _ R C _ E. 

What about ""circa""? But that's 5 letters? C-I-R-C-A -> but that ends with A, not E, and the pattern is not _ R _ _ E.

Alternatively, maybe there is no common word with the pattern _ R C _ E? 

Let me try: 
  ""mercy"" -> M-E-R-C-Y -> but position2 is E, not R.

  ""porch"" -> P-O-R-C-H -> but ends with H, not E.

  ""torch"" -> same.

  ""farce"" -> F-A-R-C-E -> has A and position2 is A? No, F(1), A(2), R(3) -> not R in position2.

So it seems difficult to find a word with _ R C _ E.

Therefore, perhaps C is in position4? Then pattern: _ R _ C E.

Words: 
  price (P-R-I-C-E)
  trice (T-R-I-C-E)
  brice (B-R-I-C-E) - less common
  urcei? not common.

Also, ""force"" doesn't fit because it has O in position2.

Another word: ""grace"" but has A.

""trace"" has A.

So without A, we have ""price"", ""trice"", and maybe ""brice"". 

But ""price"" is a common word.

So let's use ""PRICE"" as the next guess.

It tests:
- P in position1: if P is in the word and correct, we get ✓; if in the word but wrong position, we get -; if not, we get x.
- R in position2: we know it's correct, so we expect ✓.
- I in position3: tests if I is in the word and in that position.
- C in position4: we are testing if C is in position4 (if ✓ then yes, if - then it must be in position3 because we know C is in the word and not in position1, and position2 and 5 are taken by R and E).
- E in position5: we know it's correct, so ✓.

This guess will help us determine the position of C and also test P and I.

If we get feedback that C is ✓ in position4, then we know the pattern is _ R _ C E, and we have two letters left: position1 and position3.

If C is - in position4, then we know C is in position3 (because that's the only other possibility), so the pattern is _ R C _ E, and we have to find position1 and position4.

So either way, we narrow down.

Therefore, I choose ""PRICE"" as the next guess.

But note: we must not use letters we know are absent? We are allowed, but it's inefficient. However, in this case, we are not using A or N, so it's okay.

So the guess is ""PRICE"".

But wait, what if the secret word is ""CRWTH""? But that doesn't have E at the end? We know the fifth letter is E. So it must end with E.

Another possibility: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

So, let's go with ""PRICE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (misplaced, marked as ""-"").
- R is correct and in position 2 (marked as ""✓"").
- A is not in the word (marked as ""x"").
- N is not in the word (marked as ""x"").
- E is correct and in position 5 (marked as ""✓"").

Key insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E (position 2 is R, position 5 is E).
- The word contains C, but not in position 1. Since positions 2 and 5 are fixed, C must be in position 3 or 4.
- A and N are eliminated; they cannot appear in the word.
- The goal of the second guess is to:
  - Confirm the position of C (by testing it in position 4).
  - Test new common letters (P and I) to gather more information.
  - Avoid using A or N.

The word ""PRICE"" fits well because:
- It maintains R in position 2 and E in position 5 (expected to be correct).
- It places C in position 4 (to test if C is in position 4 or 3).
- It introduces P (position 1) and I (position 3), which are common letters not yet tested.
- It is a valid 5-letter word without A or N.

If C is in position 4, it will be marked ""✓""; if in position 3, it will be marked ""-"" (since position 4 would be wrong). This will help narrow down the pattern for the next guess.

There\'s no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word that maximizes the information gained (i.e., covers common letters and multiple positions).\n\nA common starting word in similar word games is ""CRANE"" because it includes common letters and covers multiple vowels and consonants.

A strategic first guess like ""CRANE"" works well because it:\n- Covers 3 common vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (C, R, N)\n- Helps identify letter positions efficiently\n- Is a valid 5-letter English word\n\nThis sets me up for useful feedback without repetition risk.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C: (-) meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- R: (✓) meaning R is in the correct position (so the second letter is R).\n- A: (x) meaning A is not in the word.\n- N: (x) meaning N is not in the word.\n- E: (✓) meaning E is in the correct position (so the fifth letter is E).\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The second letter is R.\n- The fifth letter is E.\n- The word contains the letter C, but not in the first position (since we had C in the first position and it was marked as wrong position).\n- The word does not contain A or N.\n\nAlso, note that the word has 5 letters and is an English word.\n\nSo, the current known pattern is: _ R _ _ E\n\nWe also know that the word contains C (but not in the first position). So C must be in one of the positions 3 or 4 (since position 2 is R and position 5 is E, and position 1 is not C).\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. We should try to include other common letters to uncover more of the word, while also respecting the known constraints.\n\nConstraints for the new guess:\n- Must be a 5-letter English word.\n- Must not contain A or N (since they are not in the secret word).\n- Should include C in a position that is not the first (so we can test positions 3 or 4) and also include other letters that are likely.\n\nBut note: we are not required to use the same letters. We are trying to find the secret word.\n\nWe also know that the secret word has an R in the second position and E at the end, and it has a C somewhere in the middle (positions 3 or 4).\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ E and have a C in the third or fourth position.\n\nPossible words:\n- If C is in the third position: then pattern is _ R C _ E. Examples: ""force"", ""trace"" (but trace has A which is excluded), ""price"", ""grace"" (has A), ""brice"" (not common). \n  But note: we cannot use A, so words with A are invalid for the secret word, but we can use them as guesses? Actually, the guess must be a valid English word, but it can contain letters we know are not in the secret word? \n  The rules say: ""Each guess must be a valid 5-letter English word."" It doesn\'t say we cannot use letters that are not in the secret word. However, using a letter we know is not in the secret word (like A) might not be efficient because it will be marked as \'x\' and we don\'t gain new information about other letters.\n\nSo, to maximize information, we should avoid using letters we know are not in the word (A and N). Also, we already know C, R, E are in the word. We need to find the other two letters.\n\nWe know the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we don\'t have information about duplicates yet.\n\nBut in the feedback for CRANE, we had two correct (R and E) and one misplaced (C). The other two (A and N) are absent. So the secret word has at least the letters R, E, and C. And two more letters.\n\nWe can try to think of words that fit: _ R _ _ E, and contain C, and without A and N.\n\nLet me list some possibilities:\n- Position 3: if C is in position 3: _ R C _ E. Then the word must have two more letters: one in position 1 and one in position 4.\n  Examples: \n    force (F in 1, O in 4) -> but O is a new letter.\n    price (P in 1, I in 4)\n    trice (T in 1, I in 4) -> but we haven\'t tested T or I.\n    brice (B in 1, I in 4) -> but ""brice"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be a name, but we need common words.\n\n- Position 4: if C is in position 4: _ R _ C E. Then the word has pattern _ R _ C E.\n  Examples:\n    trace (but has A, excluded) -> invalid for secret word, but we can guess it? We shouldn\'t because we know A is not in the secret word and we want to test other letters.\n    grace (has A) -> same issue.\n    force? No, force has C in position 3, not 4.\n    Actually, let me think: words ending with ""CE"" and having R in the second position. \n    Examples: ""arise"" -> but no C and has A. \n    ""urge"" is 4 letters. \n    ""price"" has C in position 4? No, P-R-I-C-E -> so C is in position 4? Actually, in ""price"", the letters are: P (1), R (2), I (3), C (4), E (5). So that fits the pattern if we put C in position 4? But wait, in the pattern _ R _ C E, that would be: position1: ?, position2: R, position3: ?, position4: C, position5: E. So ""price"" is P in 1, R in 2, I in 3, C in 4, E in 5 -> so it fits the pattern with C in position 4.\n\nBut note: in our first guess, we had C in position 1 and it was misplaced. So in the secret word, C cannot be in position 1, but it can be in position 4. Similarly, it can be in position 3.\n\nSo both ""price"" (with C in position 4) and ""force"" (with C in position 3) are possible.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one. Also, we need to test other letters.\n\nWe have two unknown positions: position 1 and position 3 (if C is in 4) or position 1 and position 4 (if C is in 3). Actually, if C is in position 3, then we have position 1 and 4 unknown. If C is in position 4, then we have position 1 and 3 unknown.\n\nWe also have two more letters to discover.\n\nWe should choose a guess that can help us determine the position of C and also test other common letters.\n\nIdea: use a word that has C in a different position than the first, and also includes other common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we know A and N are out.\n\nCommon vowels: O, I, U (but E is already in, and A is out). Common consonants: S, T, L, etc.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has the known letters (R and E) in the same positions to confirm, and also put C in a position we are testing (say position 3 or 4) and then use other new letters.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to reuse the same word? We are making a new guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid using R and E in the same positions? But we know they are correct, so if we change them, we might get less information. Actually, we can use them to confirm, but the feedback will show they are correct again.\n\nBut to test more letters, we might want to use a word that has R and E in the same positions (so we don\'t waste those) and then use the other positions to test new letters.\n\nSo, pattern for guess: _ R _ _ E\n\nWe must include C in either position 3 or 4? Actually, we don\'t have to, but we know C is in the word, so we can put it in a position we suspect.\n\nBut we have two possibilities for C: position 3 or 4. We can design a guess that tests one of these and also tests other letters.\n\nLet me propose: ""PRICE""\n\nWhy?\n- It has P (new letter) in position 1.\n- R in position 2 (correct, so we expect a check).\n- I (new vowel) in position 3.\n- C in position 4 (we are testing if C is in position 4).\n- E in position 5 (correct, so we expect a check).\n\nIf the secret word has C in position 4, then we will get C as correct (✓). If not, then we might get C as misplaced (-) or if it\'s in position 3, then we get misplaced for C? But note: if the secret word has C in position 3, then in ""PRICE"", the C is in position 4, which is wrong, so it would be marked as (-) if the secret word has a C and it\'s not in position 4? But we know the secret word has a C, so if it\'s not in position 4, then it must be in position 3 (since position 1 is not allowed and position 2 is R and position 5 is E). So if we get C as (-), then we know C is in position 3. If we get C as (✓), then it\'s in position 4.\n\nAlso, we test P and I.\n\nAlternatively, we could use ""FORCE"":\n- F in position 1.\n- O in position 4 (if we put C in position 3) -> pattern: F O R C E? No, ""force"" is F(1), O(2)? Wait, no: force is F, O, R, C, E -> so position2 is O, but we know position2 must be R? That\'s a problem.\n\nWait, in ""force"", the second letter is O, but we know the second letter of the secret word is R. So we cannot use ""force"" because it has O in position 2, but we need R in position 2.\n\nSo we must have R in position 2 and E in position 5.\n\nTherefore, the guess must have R in position 2 and E in position 5.\n\nSo, for the pattern: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] E\n\nWe can put C in position3 or position4.\n\nOption 1: put C in position3: then the guess is [letter1] R C [letter4] E. We need to choose letter1 and letter4 that are not A or N, and form a valid word.\n\nExamples: \n  price -> wait, price has C in position4? Let me spell: P-R-I-C-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:R, 3:I, 4:C, 5:E -> so C is in position4, not 3.\n\nTo have C in position3: we need words like: \n  trace -> but has A (excluded) and also A is not allowed, so invalid for our purpose? But we can use it as a guess? We know A is not in the secret word, so if we use ""trace"", we get A as \'x\'. But we want to avoid known absent letters to test new ones.\n\nBetter to use a word without A or N.\n\nWhat about ""brice""? But ""brice"" is not a common word. Let me check: it might be accepted? But we should stick to common words.\n\nAnother word: ""trice"" -> T-R-I-C-E -> that\'s T in 1, R in 2, I in 3, C in 4, E in 5 -> so C is in position4 again.\n\nTo have C in position3, we need the pattern: [letter1] R C [letter4] E.\n\nWhat words have that? \n  ""force"" is F-O-R-C-E -> that\'s O in position2, not R. So no.\n\n  ""arced"" -> has A and not R in position2.\n\n  ""orcae"" -> not common and has O in position2.\n\n  Actually, I cannot think of a common word with pattern _ R C _ E. \n\nWhat about ""circa""? But that\'s 5 letters? C-I-R-C-A -> but that ends with A, not E, and the pattern is not _ R _ _ E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is no common word with the pattern _ R C _ E? \n\nLet me try: \n  ""mercy"" -> M-E-R-C-Y -> but position2 is E, not R.\n\n  ""porch"" -> P-O-R-C-H -> but ends with H, not E.\n\n  ""torch"" -> same.\n\n  ""farce"" -> F-A-R-C-E -> has A and position2 is A? No, F(1), A(2), R(3) -> not R in position2.\n\nSo it seems difficult to find a word with _ R C _ E.\n\nTherefore, perhaps C is in position4? Then pattern: _ R _ C E.\n\nWords: \n  price (P-R-I-C-E)\n  trice (T-R-I-C-E)\n  brice (B-R-I-C-E) - less common\n  urcei? not common.\n\nAlso, ""force"" doesn\'t fit because it has O in position2.\n\nAnother word: ""grace"" but has A.\n\n""trace"" has A.\n\nSo without A, we have ""price"", ""trice"", and maybe ""brice"". \n\nBut ""price"" is a common word.\n\nSo let\'s use ""PRICE"" as the next guess.\n\nIt tests:\n- P in position1: if P is in the word and correct, we get ✓; if in the word but wrong position, we get -; if not, we get x.\n- R in position2: we know it\'s correct, so we expect ✓.\n- I in position3: tests if I is in the word and in that position.\n- C in position4: we are testing if C is in position4 (if ✓ then yes, if - then it must be in position3 because we know C is in the word and not in position1, and position2 and 5 are taken by R and E).\n- E in position5: we know it\'s correct, so ✓.\n\nThis guess will help us determine the position of C and also test P and I.\n\nIf we get feedback that C is ✓ in position4, then we know the pattern is _ R _ C E, and we have two letters left: position1 and position3.\n\nIf C is - in position4, then we know C is in position3 (because that\'s the only other possibility), so the pattern is _ R C _ E, and we have to find position1 and position4.\n\nSo either way, we narrow down.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""PRICE"" as the next guess.\n\nBut note: we must not use letters we know are absent? We are allowed, but it\'s inefficient. However, in this case, we are not using A or N, so it\'s okay.\n\nSo the guess is ""PRICE"".\n\nBut wait, what if the secret word is ""CRWTH""? But that doesn\'t have E at the end? We know the fifth letter is E. So it must end with E.\n\nAnother possibility: the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates yet.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PRICE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C is in the word but not in position 1 (misplaced, marked as ""-"").\n- R is correct and in position 2 (marked as ""✓"").\n- A is not in the word (marked as ""x"").\n- N is not in the word (marked as ""x"").\n- E is correct and in position 5 (marked as ""✓"").\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E (position 2 is R, position 5 is E).\n- The word contains C, but not in position 1.

We are given the feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE -> C(-), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning:
- C is in the word, but not in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and is misplaced).
- R is in the word in position 2 (correct).
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word in position 5 (correct).

Second guess: PRICE -> P(x), R(✓), I(✓), C(✓), E(✓)
Meaning:
- P is not in the word.
- R is correct in position 2 (as before).
- I is correct in position 3 (new information).
- C is correct in position 4 (new information).
- E is correct in position 5 (as before).

Now, putting together the information:

From first guess:
- The word must be _ R _ _ E (positions: 2 is R, 5 is E).
- C is in the word, but not in position 1. So C must be in position 3 or 4.

From second guess:
- I is correct in position 3, so the third letter is I.
- C is correct in position 4, so the fourth letter is C.
- Also, P is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown (but not P, A, N, and must be a letter not eliminated)
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: I (fixed, from second guess)
- Position 4: C (fixed, from second guess)
- Position 5: E (fixed)

So the current pattern is: _ R I C E

We only need to find the first letter.

We also know that:
- The word contains the letter C, and we now know it's in position 4 (from second guess).
- The word does not contain A, N, or P (from the feedback).

Moreover, from the first guess, we had C in position 1 marked as misplaced. But now we've placed C in position 4 correctly, so that condition is satisfied.

What about the first letter? We must choose a letter that:
- Is not in the set of eliminated letters (so not A, N, P)
- Forms a valid English word with ""RICE"" at the end.

Possible words ending with ""RICE"": 
- BRICE? But might be less common. Actually, we have ""price"" already, but we need a word starting with a letter that hasn't been eliminated.

Common words with the pattern _ R I C E:
- ""PRICE"" is one, but we guessed it and P is eliminated? No, we guessed ""PRICE"" and P is not in the word? The feedback said P(x), so P is not in the word, so the secret word cannot start with P? Actually, the word ""PRICE"" starts with P, but since we got P(x), it means the first letter is not P and also P is not in the word at all? 

Wait: Recall the feedback symbols:
- ✓ : correct letter and position.
- - : letter in the word but wrong position.
- x: letter not in the word.

For P in the second guess: it was position 1 and got ""x"", which means:
- P is not in the word at all? Yes, because if P were in the word but in a different position, it would be ""-"". But it was marked ""x"", so P is entirely absent.

Similarly, in the first guess, A and N were ""x"", so they are absent.

Therefore, the secret word cannot start with P because P is not in the word, and also cannot be A or N.

So we need to find the first letter of "" R I C E"" such that the word exists and doesn't use A, N, P.

What are possible letters?
- We can consider common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, forming 5-letter words ending with ""RICE"":
- The only common word I can think of is ""PRICE"", but we've eliminated P. Are there others?
- ""TRICE"": which means a very short period of time. That's a valid word? Yes, and T is not eliminated.
- ""BRICE"": less common, but B is not eliminated? But we can use it if it's valid. However, ""brice"" might not be standard; let's stick to common words.

Other possibilities? 
- ""URICE""? Not a word.
- ""GRICE""? Not common.
- ""FRICE""? Not a word.

So probably ""TRICE"" is the most common alternative.

But wait, is ""TRICE"" the only option? Perhaps ""WRICE"" but not English.

Another word: ""THRICE""? But that starts with TH, so it's T-H-R-I-C-E? That is 6 letters? No: T-H-R-I-C-E is 6 letters? Let me count: T,H,R,I,C,E → 6 letters. So no.

Therefore, the most plausible word is ""TRICE"".

But note: ""TRICE"" has letters: T (position1), R (2), I (3), C (4), E (5). So it fits the pattern.

Moreover, T has not been eliminated. We haven't guessed T before, so we don't know if it's in the word or not? But the pattern requires that the first letter is anything that makes a valid word, and we don't have constraints on T.

But wait, could there be duplicates? We don't know, but since we only have one unknown position, we can test it.

Alternatively, is there any other word that fits? 

Let me double-check:
- The pattern must be: [letter] R I C E
- And the word must be English.

Other than ""PRICE"" (which is invalid because P is absent) and ""TRICE"", what are there?
- ""BRICE"": as in Brian (proper noun), but not typically accepted as a common noun? Maybe, but let's assume the word is common.

Another: ""CRICE""? Wait, we know C is already used? But we don't have a pattern for duplicate C? The pattern is _ R I C E. We don't know if the first letter can be C? But from first guess, C was marked misplaced as the first letter? Actually, in first guess we guessed C in position 1 and it was ""-"", meaning C is in the word but not in position 1. Now we have C in position 4 correctly. So if we use ""CRICE"", that has C in position 1? But according to the feedback, position 1 cannot be C because it was misplaced (so in the secret word, C is not in position 1). Therefore, ""CRICE"" would have C in position 1, which we know is incorrect. So we cannot have a word starting with C because we know C is not in position 1.

Also, if the first letter were C, then in the second guess, we had I and C also? But the feedback said C was correct in position 4? Then if the first letter were also C, we would have two C's? But in the feedback for PRICE, we got only one C marked (in position 4). Specifically, the C was marked ""✓"" in position 4, meaning that C belongs in position 4. So if there were another C, it might have been marked? Actually, the feedback marks each instance. So if the secret word had two C's, one in position 4 and one in another position, and in our guess we have only one C (in position 4), then we would get that C as ""✓"", but if there were another C, say in position 1, then we have not guessed it, so it wouldn't be marked? Or would the system indicate that? The rules say ""Each letter in your guess"" gets a symbol. So if we don't guess a letter, it doesn't show. But in this case, we only have one C in ""PRICE"", so if the secret word had two C's, then in position 4 we got ""✓"", and we didn't guess the other C, so we wouldn't know? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about letters we didn't guess.

Therefore, it's possible that the secret word has two C's? But we haven't seen an indication so far. In the first guess, we guessed C in position 1 and got ""-"", meaning that at least one C exists in the wrong position? But now we have C confirmed in position 4. So if there were a second C, it would have been in position 1? But we know position 1 cannot be C because if it were, in the first guess, if the secret word had C in position 1, then it should have been marked ""✓"" for position 1? But it was marked ""-"", so that means C is not in position 1. Therefore, the secret word cannot have C in position 1, so if there were a duplicate C, it would have to be in another position? We have only position 3 available? But position 3 is now I? So no, position 3 is I, so it cannot be C again? So if the secret word has C in position 4, and position 1 can't be C, position 2 is R, position 3 is I, position 5 is E, then there is no room for another C? Therefore, the secret word has exactly one C, in position 4.

Similarly, for other letters? But back to the first letter: we need to find a word starting with a letter that isn't A, N, P, or C (at least C can't be in position 1, and we need a letter that is not eliminated).

Also, not repeated? But we don't know, but in this case, we are looking for the first letter.

So possible words: TRICE, BRICE (if accepted). Are there any others?

Another: ""GRICE""? Meaning young pig? It might be obsolete. Not common. ""WRICE""? Not English.

So essentially, ""TRICE"" is a viable word.

Therefore, I'll guess ""TRICE"".

But note: we already have almost all information, so TRICE should be the secret word? Let me confirm the feedback.

If we guess TRICE:
- T: first letter, new. We don't know if T is in the word? But the secret word might have T? Or it might not. Actually, the pattern we have is _ R I C E. So if the secret word is PRICE, but P is absent, so it cannot be. So must be TRICE? Or BRICE? Or FRICE? etc. 

But TRICE is a word: it means ""hoist"" or ""haul up"" (verb), or as a noun ""instant"".

Similarly, BRICE: an old French form of Bryson? Not common.

Moreover, we can consider other words? 

Another possibility: ""URICE""? Not English.

So TRICE is the best guess.

Perhaps ""BRINE"": but that doesn't fit: B-R-I-N-E, but we have C in position 4? And E in position 5? The pattern is _ R I C E, which for TRICE is T-R-I-C-E, so yes.

But wait, in the secret word, we know position 4 must be C? Because in the second guess, C was marked ""✓"" in position 4? So position 4 is C? Indisputably? Correct.

So the word must end with ""ICE""? No, the word must be * * * C E? But positions: 1,2,3,4,5 -> letter3 is I, letter4 is C, letter5 is E? So the word ends with ""ICE""? But ""ICE"" is I-C-E? Position 3 I, 4 C, 5 E: so the last three are I,C,E? So that's ""ICE"" as a suffix? Actually, it's I-C-E in positions 3,4,5? So the word must be like _ R + ICE? Hence ""PRICE"" but P is invalid? So ""TRICE"" is the alternative.

Therefore, I will guess ""TRICE"".

But note: we also know from first guess that C was misplaced? That condition is satisfied because now C is in position 4? Yes.

Also, we must ensure that T is not eliminated? We haven't guessed T before, so it's possible.

Therefore, the guess is ""TRICE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C is in the word but not position 1 (-), R is correct position 2 (✓), A is absent (x), N is absent (x), E is correct position 5 (✓).  
  → Pattern: _ R _ _ E  
  → C is present (not position 1), no A/N.
- **Guess 2 (PRICE)**: P is absent (x), R is correct position 2 (✓), I is correct position 3 (✓), C is correct position 4 (✓), E is correct position 5 (✓).  
  → Pattern: _ R I C E  
  → P is absent, no duplicates detected for R, I, C, E.  

**Key deductions**:
- The secret word pattern is now fully constrained to _ R I C E (positions 1–5: unknown, R, I, C, E).
- Eliminated letters: A, N, P (confirmed absent).
- Since C is fixed in position 4 and cannot be in position 1 (as per Guess 1 feedback), only **position 1 remains unknown**.
- Position 1 must be a letter not eliminated (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) that forms a valid English word.
- Common words fitting the pattern include ""TRICE"" (meaning a brief moment) or ""BRICE"" (less common). ""TRICE"" is the most plausible choice given common English words.

Given this, the next guess is ""TRICE"" to test the only unknown position. If incorrect, the feedback will confirm or deny T, narrowing options further (e.g., ""BRICE"" if T is absent).

<guess>TRICE</guess>",TRICE,"We are given the feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE -> C(-), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
Meaning:
- C is in the word, but not in position 1 (since it was guessed in position 1 and is misplaced).
- R is in the word in position 2 (correct).
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word in position 5 (correct).

Second guess: PRICE -> P(x), R(✓), I(✓), C(✓), E(✓)
Meaning:
- P is not in the word.
- R is correct in position 2 (as before).
- I is correct in position 3 (new information).
- C is correct in position 4 (new information).
- E is correct in position 5 (as before).

Now, putting together the information:

From first guess:
- The word must be _ R _ _ E (positions: 2 is R, 5 is E).
- C is in the word, but not in position 1. So C must be in position 3 or 4.

From second guess:
- I is correct in position 3, so the third letter is I.
- C is correct in position 4, so the fourth letter is C.
- Also, P is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown (but not P, A, N, and must be a letter not eliminated)
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: I (fixed, from second guess)
- Position 4: C (fixed, from second guess)
- Position 5: E (fixed)

So the current pattern is: _ R I C E

We only need to find the first letter.

We also know that:
- The word contains the letter C, and we now know it's in position 4 (from second guess).
- The word does not contain A, N, or P (from the feedback).

Moreover, from the first guess, we had C in position 1 marked as misplaced. But now we've placed C in position 4 correctly, so that condition is satisfied.

What about the first letter? We must choose a letter that:
- Is not in the set of eliminated letters (so not A, N, P)
- Forms a valid English word with ""RICE"" at the end.

Possible words ending with ""RICE"": 
- BRICE? But might be less common. Actually, we have ""price"" already, but we need a word starting with a letter that hasn't been eliminated.

Common words with the pattern _ R I C E:
- ""PRICE"" is one, but we guessed it and P is eliminated? No, we guessed ""PRICE"" and P is not in the word? The feedback said P(x), so P is not in the word, so the secret word cannot start with P? Actually, the word ""PRICE"" starts with P, but since we got P(x), it means the first letter is not P and also P is not in the word at all? 

Wait: Recall the feedback symbols:
- ✓ : correct letter and position.
- - : letter in the word but wrong position.
- x: letter not in the word.

For P in the second guess: it was position 1 and got ""x"", which means:
- P is not in the word at all? Yes, because if P were in the word but in a different position, it would be ""-"". But it was marked ""x"", so P is entirely absent.

Similarly, in the first guess, A and N were ""x"", so they are absent.

Therefore, the secret word cannot start with P because P is not in the word, and also cannot be A or N.

So we need to find the first letter of "" R I C E"" such that the word exists and doesn't use A, N, P.

What are possible letters?
- We can consider common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, forming 5-letter words ending with ""RICE"":
- The only common word I can think of is ""PRICE"", but we've eliminated P. Are there others?
- ""TRICE"": which means a very short period of time. That's a valid word? Yes, and T is not eliminated.
- ""BRICE"": less common, but B is not eliminated? But we can use it if it's valid. However, ""brice"" might not be standard; let's stick to common words.

Other possibilities? 
- ""URICE""? Not a word.
- ""GRICE""? Not common.
- ""FRICE""? Not a word.

So probably ""TRICE"" is the most common alternative.

But wait, is ""TRICE"" the only option? Perhaps ""WRICE"" but not English.

Another word: ""THRICE""? But that starts with TH, so it's T-H-R-I-C-E? That is 6 letters? No: T-H-R-I-C-E is 6 letters? Let me count: T,H,R,I,C,E → 6 letters. So no.

Therefore, the most plausible word is ""TRICE"".

But note: ""TRICE"" has letters: T (position1), R (2), I (3), C (4), E (5). So it fits the pattern.

Moreover, T has not been eliminated. We haven't guessed T before, so we don't know if it's in the word or not? But the pattern requires that the first letter is anything that makes a valid word, and we don't have constraints on T.

But wait, could there be duplicates? We don't know, but since we only have one unknown position, we can test it.

Alternatively, is there any other word that fits? 

Let me double-check:
- The pattern must be: [letter] R I C E
- And the word must be English.

Other than ""PRICE"" (which is invalid because P is absent) and ""TRICE"", what are there?
- ""BRICE"": as in Brian (proper noun), but not typically accepted as a common noun? Maybe, but let's assume the word is common.

Another: ""CRICE""? Wait, we know C is already used? But we don't have a pattern for duplicate C? The pattern is _ R I C E. We don't know if the first letter can be C? But from first guess, C was marked misplaced as the first letter? Actually, in first guess we guessed C in position 1 and it was ""-"", meaning C is in the word but not in position 1. Now we have C in position 4 correctly. So if we use ""CRICE"", that has C in position 1? But according to the feedback, position 1 cannot be C because it was misplaced (so in the secret word, C is not in position 1). Therefore, ""CRICE"" would have C in position 1, which we know is incorrect. So we cannot have a word starting with C because we know C is not in position 1.

Also, if the first letter were C, then in the second guess, we had I and C also? But the feedback said C was correct in position 4? Then if the first letter were also C, we would have two C's? But in the feedback for PRICE, we got only one C marked (in position 4). Specifically, the C was marked ""✓"" in position 4, meaning that C belongs in position 4. So if there were another C, it might have been marked? Actually, the feedback marks each instance. So if the secret word had two C's, one in position 4 and one in another position, and in our guess we have only one C (in position 4), then we would get that C as ""✓"", but if there were another C, say in position 1, then we have not guessed it, so it wouldn't be marked? Or would the system indicate that? The rules say ""Each letter in your guess"" gets a symbol. So if we don't guess a letter, it doesn't show. But in this case, we only have one C in ""PRICE"", so if the secret word had two C's, then in position 4 we got ""✓"", and we didn't guess the other C, so we wouldn't know? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about letters we didn't guess.

Therefore, it's possible that the secret word has two C's? But we haven't seen an indication so far. In the first guess, we guessed C in position 1 and got ""-"", meaning that at least one C exists in the wrong position? But now we have C confirmed in position 4. So if there were a second C, it would have been in position 1? But we know position 1 cannot be C because if it were, in the first guess, if the secret word had C in position 1, then it should have been marked ""✓"" for position 1? But it was marked ""-"", so that means C is not in position 1. Therefore, the secret word cannot have C in position 1, so if there were a duplicate C, it would have to be in another position? We have only position 3 available? But position 3 is now I? So no, position 3 is I, so it cannot be C again? So if the secret word has C in position 4, and position 1 can't be C, position 2 is R, position 3 is I, position 5 is E, then there is no room for another C? Therefore, the secret word has exactly one C, in position 4.

Similarly, for other letters? But back to the first letter: we need to find a word starting with a letter that isn't A, N, P, or C (at least C can't be in position 1, and we need a letter that is not eliminated).

Also, not repeated? But we don't know, but in this case, we are looking for the first letter.

So possible words: TRICE, BRICE (if accepted). Are there any others?

Another: ""GRICE""? Meaning young pig? It might be obsolete. Not common. ""WRICE""? Not English.

So essentially, ""TRICE"" is a viable word.

Therefore, I'll guess ""TRICE"".

But note: we already have almost all information, so TRICE should be the secret word? Let me confirm the feedback.

Another possibility: ""URICE""? Not English.

So TRICE is the best guess.

Perhaps ""BRINE"": but that doesn't fit: B-R-I-N-E, but we have C in position 4? And E in position 5? The pattern is _ R I C E, which for TRICE is T-R-I-C-E, so yes.

Position 3 I, 4 C, 5 E: so the last three are I,C,E? So that's ""ICE"" as a suffix? Actually, it's I-C-E in positions 3,4,5? So the word must be like _ R + ICE? Hence ""PRICE"" but P is invalid? So ""TRICE"" is the alternative.

Therefore, I will guess ""TRICE"".

But note: we also know from first guess that C was misplaced? That condition is satisfied because now C is in position 4? Yes.

Also, we must ensure that T is not eliminated? We haven't guessed T before, so it's possible.

Therefore, the guess is ""TRICE"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C is in the word but not position 1 (-), R is correct position 2 (✓), A is absent (x), N is absent (x), E is correct position 5 (✓).
