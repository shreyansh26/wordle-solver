We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Let me pick ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

 But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", so let's see what feedback we would get with ""CRANE"" for ""BRISK"":
   C: not in BRISK -> x
   R: in BRISK and at the same position? In ""CRANE"", R is the second letter. In ""BRISK"", R is the second letter -> ✓
   A: not in BRISK -> x
   N: not in BRISK -> x
   E: not in BRISK -> x

 That would give: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x) -> we only get one green R and the rest gray. Not very informative.

 Alternatively, let's consider ""ROAST"":
   R: in BRISK and at position 1? In ""ROAST"", R is first, but in ""BRISK"" R is second -> so it's in the word but wrong position -> (-)
   O: not in BRISK -> x
   A: not in BRISK -> x
   S: in BRISK and at position 4? In ""ROAST"", S is fourth, in ""BRISK"" S is fourth? Actually, BRISK: positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:S, 5:K -> so S is fourth -> ✓
   T: not in BRISK -> x

 So feedback: R(-) O(x) A(x) S(✓) T(x) -> we get one green S and one yellow R.

 Another common word is ""SLATE"":
   S: in BRISK at position 4 -> but in SLATE, S is first -> so yellow (-)
   L: not in BRISK -> x
   A: not in BRISK -> x
   T: not in BRISK -> x
   E: not in BRISK -> x
 -> only one yellow S.

 How about ""STARE"":
   S: in BRISK -> position: in STARE S is first, in BRISK S is fourth -> yellow (-)
   T: not in BRISK -> x
   A: not in BRISK -> x
   R: in BRISK and at position 2? In STARE, R is fourth -> but in BRISK R is second -> so yellow (-)
   E: not in BRISK -> x
 -> two yellows: S and R.

 That's better than just one.

 But note: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 Another popular starting word is ""RAISE"". Let's check for BRISK:
   R: in BRISK at position 2 -> in RAISE, R is first -> yellow (-)
   A: not in BRISK -> x
   I: in BRISK at position 3 -> in RAISE, I is third -> green (✓)
   S: in BRISK at position 4 -> in RAISE, S is fourth -> green (✓)
   E: not in BRISK -> x
 -> feedback: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x) -> two greens and one yellow.

 That's very informative.

 So I think ""RAISE"" is a good starting word because it has three vowels and two common consonants, and in the example it gives good feedback.

 However, note that the example secret word was just an example. We don't know the real word.

 But since we are starting, let's go with ""RAISE"".

 Alternatively, ""ARISE"" is similar and also common.

 But to be consistent, I'll choose ""RAISE"".

 However, let me check the frequency: 
   R, A, I, S, E are all common.

 But note: the word must be valid. ""RAISE"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, I will guess ""RAISE"".
</think>
For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information by covering common letters and positions. I chose ""RAISE"" because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which frequently appear in 5-letter words. This combination helps test multiple letter positions efficiently, increasing the chances of useful feedback (correct positions, misplaced letters, or exclusions) for subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": 
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  I: - (in the word but wrong position)
  S: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback:
- The letters R, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter A is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letter I is in the word but not in the third position (since we guessed it in the third position and it's marked as wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word contains A and I, but not R, S, or E.

Also, note that A and I are not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain R, S, E (since they are not in the word)
- Contains A and I, but not in positions 2 and 3 (because we know they are misplaced from those positions)
- We can include other common letters to test.

Let's think about the positions:
- A is in the word but not at position 2. So A can be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we guessed A at position 2 and it was wrong position, so A is in the word but not at 2. It could be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Similarly, I is in the word but not at position 3. So I can be at 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we have to avoid positions that we know are incorrect for these letters.

We also know that the word does not have R, S, E.

We can consider other common letters: T, O, L, N, U, C, D, M, P, etc.

We want to test as many new letters as possible and also try to place A and I in new positions.

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5

But note: we cannot put A and I in the same position? Well, they are different letters so they will be in different positions.

We should avoid using the same letters again? We must use A and I because they are in the word, but we can use them in different positions.

Let's try to form a word that includes A and I, and three new letters (not R, S, E) and place A and I in positions that are still possible.

For example, we can try to put A at position 1 and I at position 2? But we don't know if that's correct, but we can test.

Alternatively, we can try to put A at position 4 and I at position 5? We have to see what words are possible.

We should also consider that we have two letters that we know are in the word (A and I) and we need to find three more.

But we don't know the other three letters. So we need to test common consonants.

Let me list some common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, O, U, etc.

We can try a word that has A, I, and three of these.

But note: we have to avoid R, S, E.

Let me think of words that have A and I and three new letters.

For example:
- PAINT: P, A, I, N, T -> but note, we have A at position 2 and I at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 2? Wait, in PAINT: A is at position 2 and I at position 3. But our feedback says A is not at position 2 and I is not at position 3. So PAINT would be invalid because we are putting A at 2 and I at 3 again? Actually, we can try to put them in different positions.

We need to avoid position 2 for A and position 3 for I.

So in the new guess, we should put A in one of {1,3,4,5} and I in one of {1,2,4,5}, but not the same position.

Let me try to find a word that has A and I and three new letters, with A not at 2 and I not at 3.

For example:
- If we put A at position 1: then the word starts with A. Then I can be at 2,4,5? But we don't know. Let's see: words like ALOUD? But no I. Or AEGIS? But E is not allowed. We cannot use E.

We need words without R, S, E.

Let me think of words starting with A and containing I: 
- AUDIO: but has E? No, AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O -> no E, no R, no S. But we have A at 1, I at 4? That's good because A is not at 2 and I is not at 3.

But AUDIO: 
  A at 1 -> we don't know if that's correct, but we can test.
  I at 4 -> similarly.

Also, we test U, D, O.

But note: the word has 5 letters: A, U, D, I, O.

Is AUDIO a valid word? Yes.

But let's see if there are other options.

Another word: AVOID: A, V, O, I, D -> A at 1, I at 4? Same as above.

But we can also try to put A at 4 and I at 1? For example: 
- PIANO: but P, I, A, N, O -> I at 1, A at 3. 
  I is at position 1 (which is allowed because we only know it's not at 3) and A at position 3 (which is allowed because we know it's not at 2). 

So PIANO: 
  I at 1 -> new position for I (previously we had I at 3, now at 1)
  A at 3 -> new position for A (previously at 2, now at 3)

Also, we test P, N, O.

But note: we are not sure if I can be at 1 or A at 3, but we are testing.

Another word: PAINT: but that has A at 2 and I at 3, which we know are wrong, so we avoid.

What about PLAIT? P, L, A, I, T -> A at 3, I at 4? 
  A at 3: allowed (since not 2)
  I at 4: allowed (since not 3)

But PLAIT is a word? Yes, meaning a braid.

But we also have to consider that we are testing new letters.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters.

Let me list the letters we haven't tried: 
We have tried: R, A, I, S, E (and R, S, E are out; A and I are in)
So we have 21 other letters to try.

Common ones: T, O, L, N, U, C, D, M, P, etc.

We want to test as many as possible in one go.

In AUDIO: we test A (already known), I (already known), and U, D, O (new). That's three new letters.

In PIANO: we test I, A (known) and P, N, O (new). Also three new.

In PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T -> A and I known, and P, L, T new.

All are good.

But note: we also want to consider the positions. We have two known letters to place, and we want to test them in positions that are still possible.

We know A is not at 2, so we can try A at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
We know I is not at 3, so we can try I at 1, 2, 4, or 5.

In AUDIO: A at 1, I at 4 -> both are new positions for these letters.

In PIANO: I at 1, A at 3 -> also new positions.

In PLAIT: A at 3, I at 4 -> new positions.

Any of these would be fine.

But let's also consider that we might get more information if we can cover more common letters.

The most common letters left: T, O, L, N, etc.

In AUDIO: we have O and U, D (U and D are less common)
In PIANO: we have O, N, P (O and N are very common, P is common)
In PLAIT: we have P, L, T (L and T are very common, P is common)

So PLAIT and PIANO cover more common letters? Actually, T is very common.

But note: we don't know which ones are in the word.

Another word: TALON? But T, A, L, O, N -> but A is at position 2? We cannot put A at position 2 because we know it's not there. So TALON is invalid for A at 2.

What about TOUCH? But no A or I.

We must include A and I.

Another word: MANIA? M, A, N, I, A -> but has two A's? And A at position 2 and 5? We know A is not at 2, so if we put A at 2, it would be wrong. Also, we have A at 5? But we don't know. But the word has two A's? The secret word might have two A's? But we don't know. However, in our feedback, we only have one A marked as present, but it could be that there are two A's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. But in this case, we guessed one A and it was yellow, so there is at least one A. But there could be more.

But to be safe, we should avoid putting A at position 2. So MANIA is not good because it has A at 2.

We can try: ALOIN? A, L, O, I, N -> A at 1, I at 4? And no R,S,E. ALOIN is a word? I think it's a variant of ""aloin"" (a compound). But let's assume it's valid.

But we have to use common words.

Alternatively, we can use ""PIANO"" or ""PLAIT"".

I think ""PIANO"" is a good choice because it is a common word and tests I at position 1 and A at position 3, which are new positions, and also tests P, N, O.

So let's go with ""PIANO"".

But note: in PIANO, we have:
  P at 1, I at 2? No: P-I-A-N-O -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O.

So I is at position 2? That's allowed because we only know I is not at 3. Position 2 is new for I.

Similarly, A is at position 3: we know A is not at 2, but position 3 is new.

So we can use PIANO.

But wait: we have I at position 2 and A at position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Another option: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at 2? Not allowed. We know A is not at 2.

""ADMIN"": A, D, M, I, N -> A at 1, I at 4? That's good. ADMIN is a common word.

ADMIN: A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5.

So A at 1 (new position), I at 4 (new position), and we test D, M, N.

N is very common.

But we are testing D and M which are less common than T or L? But still, it's okay.

Alternatively, ""PAINT"" is not allowed because of positions.

I think both PIANO and ADMIN are good.

But let's choose PIANO because it has O and N, which are more common than D and M? Actually, N is common, O is common.

In PIANO: letters P, I, A, N, O -> I and A known, P, N, O new.

In ADMIN: A, D, M, I, N -> A and I known, D, M, N new.

N is in both. But PIANO has O and P, ADMIN has D and M.

The frequency of letters in English words: 
E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, ...

But we already know A and I are in, and R, S, E are out.

So the most common left are O, T, N, L, C, etc.

T is very common and we haven't tested it. So maybe we should include T.

That's why PLAIT might be better: P, L, A, I, T -> includes T and L.

In PLAIT: 
  P at 1, L at 2, A at 3, I at 4, T at 5.

A at 3 (not 2) and I at 4 (not 3) -> good.

We test P, L, T (all common) and we already know A and I.

So PLAIT tests three new common letters: T, L, P.

Similarly, we could do ""PLANT"" but A at 3? And N at 4, T at 5? But we have I to include. PLANT doesn't have I.

We must include I because we know it's in the word.

So PLAIT is good.

Is PLAIT a valid Wordle word? I think so.

Another word: ""TAXIS"" but has S and S is out.

""OCTAL"" but no A or I.

I think PLAIT is a good choice.

But let me confirm: we have to avoid R, S, E.

PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T -> no R, S, E. Good.

Positions: 
  Position 1: P (new)
  Position 2: L (new) -> but note, we don't have any information about position 2 except that A is not there. So L can be there.
  Position 3: A (we know A is not at 2, but 3 is new)
  Position 4: I (we know I is not at 3, but 4 is new)
  Position 5: T (new)

So we are testing A at 3 and I at 4, which are new positions.

We are also testing P, L, T.

So I think PLAIT is a solid choice.

Alternatively, we could do ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O -> A at 2? Oh, A at position 2 is not allowed. So invalid.

""MATCH"" no I.

So I think PLAIT is good.

But let's see if there's a word that includes T and O? Like POINT? But no A, and we must include A.

We must include both A and I.

Another word: ""PIETA""? P, I, E, T, A -> but E is not allowed, we know E is not in the word.

So avoid.

Therefore, I choose ""PLAIT"".

But note: in PLAIT, we have I at position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

We might get feedback that helps us place A and I.

So second guess: PLAIT.

But let me write it: P-L-A-I-T.

So <guess>PLAIT</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, S, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").
- I is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Include **A** and **I** (since they are in the word), but avoid placing A at position 2 or I at position 3.
2. Exclude R, S, and E (since they are not in the word).
3. Test new common letters (like T, L, P) to gather more information.

The word **""PLAIT""** fits these criteria:
- Contains **A** (placed at position 3, avoiding position 2) and **I** (placed at position 4, avoiding position 3).
- Excludes R, S, E.
- Introduces three new common letters: **P**, **L**, and **T**.
- Tests possible positions for A and I while covering high-frequency consonants.

This guess will help narrow down the secret word by checking:
- If A is correctly placed at position 3.
- If I is correctly placed at position 4.
- Whether P, L, or T are in the word and their positions.

<guess>PLAIT</guess>",PLAIT,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": 
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  I: - (in the word but wrong position)
  S: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback:
- The letters R, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter A is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letter I is in the word but not in the third position (since we guessed it in the third position and it's marked as wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word contains A and I, but not R, S, or E.

Also, note that A and I are not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain R, S, E (since they are not in the word)
- Contains A and I, but not in positions 2 and 3 (because we know they are misplaced from those positions)
- We can include other common letters to test.

Let's think about the positions:
- A is in the word but not at position 2. So A can be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we guessed A at position 2 and it was wrong position, so A is in the word but not at 2. It could be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Similarly, I is in the word but not at position 3. So I can be at 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we have to avoid positions that we know are incorrect for these letters.

We also know that the word does not have R, S, E.

We can consider other common letters: T, O, L, N, U, C, D, M, P, etc.

We want to test as many new letters as possible and also try to place A and I in new positions.

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5

But note: we cannot put A and I in the same position? Well, they are different letters so they will be in different positions.

We should avoid using the same letters again? We must use A and I because they are in the word, but we can use them in different positions.

Let's try to form a word that includes A and I, and three new letters (not R, S, E) and place A and I in positions that are still possible.

For example, we can try to put A at position 1 and I at position 2? But we don't know if that's correct, but we can test.

Alternatively, we can try to put A at position 4 and I at position 5? We have to see what words are possible.

We should also consider that we have two letters that we know are in the word (A and I) and we need to find three more.

But we don't know the other three letters. So we need to test common consonants.

Let me list some common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, O, U, etc.

We can try a word that has A, I, and three of these.

But note: we have to avoid R, S, E.

Let me think of words that have A and I and three new letters.

For example:
- PAINT: P, A, I, N, T -> but note, we have A at position 2 and I at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 2? Wait, in PAINT: A is at position 2 and I at position 3. But our feedback says A is not at position 2 and I is not at position 3. So PAINT would be invalid because we are putting A at 2 and I at 3 again? Actually, we can try to put them in different positions.

We need to avoid position 2 for A and position 3 for I.

So in the new guess, we should put A in one of {1,3,4,5} and I in one of {1,2,4,5}, but not the same position.

Let me try to find a word that has A and I and three new letters, with A not at 2 and I not at 3.

For example:
- If we put A at position 1: then the word starts with A. Then I can be at 2,4,5? But we don't know. Let's see: words like ALOUD? But no I. Or AEGIS? But E is not allowed. We cannot use E.

We need words without R, S, E.

Let me think of words starting with A and containing I: 
- AUDIO: but has E? No, AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O -> no E, no R, no S. But we have A at 1, I at 4? That's good because A is not at 2 and I is not at 3.

But AUDIO: 
  A at 1 -> we don't know if that's correct, but we can test.
  I at 4 -> similarly.

Also, we test U, D, O.

But note: the word has 5 letters: A, U, D, I, O.

Is AUDIO a valid word? Yes.

But let's see if there are other options.

Another word: AVOID: A, V, O, I, D -> A at 1, I at 4? Same as above.

But we can also try to put A at 4 and I at 1? For example: 
- PIANO: but P, I, A, N, O -> I at 1, A at 3. 
  I is at position 1 (which is allowed because we only know it's not at 3) and A at position 3 (which is allowed because we know it's not at 2). 

So PIANO: 
  I at 1 -> new position for I (previously we had I at 3, now at 1)
  A at 3 -> new position for A (previously at 2, now at 3)

Also, we test P, N, O.

But note: we are not sure if I can be at 1 or A at 3, but we are testing.

Another word: PAINT: but that has A at 2 and I at 3, which we know are wrong, so we avoid.

What about PLAIT? P, L, A, I, T -> A at 3, I at 4? 
  A at 3: allowed (since not 2)
  I at 4: allowed (since not 3)

But PLAIT is a word? Yes, meaning a braid.

But we also have to consider that we are testing new letters.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters.

Let me list the letters we haven't tried: 
We have tried: R, A, I, S, E (and R, S, E are out; A and I are in)
So we have 21 other letters to try.

Common ones: T, O, L, N, U, C, D, M, P, etc.

We want to test as many as possible in one go.

In AUDIO: we test A (already known), I (already known), and U, D, O (new). That's three new letters.

In PIANO: we test I, A (known) and P, N, O (new). Also three new.

In PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T -> A and I known, and P, L, T new.

All are good.

But note: we also want to consider the positions. We have two known letters to place, and we want to test them in positions that are still possible.

We know A is not at 2, so we can try A at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
We know I is not at 3, so we can try I at 1, 2, 4, or 5.

In AUDIO: A at 1, I at 4 -> both are new positions for these letters.

In PIANO: I at 1, A at 3 -> also new positions.

In PLAIT: A at 3, I at 4 -> new positions.

Any of these would be fine.

But let's also consider that we might get more information if we can cover more common letters.

The most common letters left: T, O, L, N, etc.

In AUDIO: we have O and U, D (U and D are less common)
In PIANO: we have O, N, P (O and N are very common, P is common)
In PLAIT: we have P, L, T (L and T are very common, P is common)

So PLAIT and PIANO cover more common letters? Actually, T is very common.

But note: we don't know which ones are in the word.

Another word: TALON? But T, A, L, O, N -> but A is at position 2? We cannot put A at position 2 because we know it's not there. So TALON is invalid for A at 2.

What about TOUCH? But no A or I.

We must include A and I.

Another word: MANIA? M, A, N, I, A -> but has two A's? And A at position 2 and 5? We know A is not at 2, so if we put A at 2, it would be wrong. Also, we have A at 5? But we don't know. But the word has two A's? The secret word might have two A's? But we don't know. However, in our feedback, we only have one A marked as present, but it could be that there are two A's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. But in this case, we guessed one A and it was yellow, so there is at least one A. But there could be more.

But to be safe, we should avoid putting A at position 2. So MANIA is not good because it has A at 2.

We can try: ALOIN? A, L, O, I, N -> A at 1, I at 4? And no R,S,E. ALOIN is a word? I think it's a variant of ""aloin"" (a compound). But let's assume it's valid.

But we have to use common words.

Alternatively, we can use ""PIANO"" or ""PLAIT"".

I think ""PIANO"" is a good choice because it is a common word and tests I at position 1 and A at position 3, which are new positions, and also tests P, N, O.

So let's go with ""PIANO"".

But note: in PIANO, we have:
  P at 1, I at 2? No: P-I-A-N-O -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O.

So I is at position 2? That's allowed because we only know I is not at 3. Position 2 is new for I.

Similarly, A is at position 3: we know A is not at 2, but position 3 is new.

So we can use PIANO.

But wait: we have I at position 2 and A at position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Another option: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at 2? Not allowed. We know A is not at 2.

""ADMIN"": A, D, M, I, N -> A at 1, I at 4? That's good. ADMIN is a common word.

ADMIN: A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5.

So A at 1 (new position), I at 4 (new position), and we test D, M, N.

N is very common.

But we are testing D and M which are less common than T or L? But still, it's okay.

Alternatively, ""PAINT"" is not allowed because of positions.

I think both PIANO and ADMIN are good.

But let's choose PIANO because it has O and N, which are more common than D and M? Actually, N is common, O is common.

In PIANO: letters P, I, A, N, O -> I and A known, P, N, O new.

In ADMIN: A, D, M, I, N -> A and I known, D, M, N new.

N is in both. But PIANO has O and P, ADMIN has D and M.

The frequency of letters in English words: 
E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, ...

But we already know A and I are in, and R, S, E are out.

So the most common left are O, T, N, L, C, etc.

T is very common and we haven't tested it. So maybe we should include T.

That's why PLAIT might be better: P, L, A, I, T -> includes T and L.

A at 3 (not 2) and I at 4 (not 3) -> good.

So PLAIT tests three new common letters: T, L, P.

Similarly, we could do ""PLANT"" but A at 3? And N at 4, T at 5? But we have I to include. PLANT doesn't have I.

We must include I because we know it's in the word.

So PLAIT is good.

Is PLAIT a valid Wordle word? I think so.

Another word: ""TAXIS"" but has S and S is out.

""OCTAL"" but no A or I.

I think PLAIT is a good choice.

But let me confirm: we have to avoid R, S, E.

PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T -> no R, S, E. Good.

Positions: 
  Position 1: P (new)
  Position 2: L (new) -> but note, we don't have any information about position 2 except that A is not there. So L can be there.
  Position 3: A (we know A is not at 2, but 3 is new)
  Position 4: I (we know I is not at 3, but 4 is new)
  Position 5: T (new)

So we are testing A at 3 and I at 4, which are new positions.

We are also testing P, L, T.

So I think PLAIT is a solid choice.

Alternatively, we could do ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O -> A at 2? Oh, A at position 2 is not allowed. So invalid.

""MATCH"" no I.

So I think PLAIT is good.

But let's see if there's a word that includes T and O? Like POINT? But no A, and we must include A.

We must include both A and I.

Another word: ""PIETA""? P, I, E, T, A -> but E is not allowed, we know E is not in the word.

So avoid.

Therefore, I choose ""PLAIT"".

But note: in PLAIT, we have I at position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

We might get feedback that helps us place A and I.

But let me write it: P-L-A-I-T.

So <guess>PLAIT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Let me pick ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

 But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", so let's see what feedback we would get with ""CRANE"" for ""BRISK"":
   C: not in BRISK -> x
   R: in BRISK and at the same position? In ""CRANE"", R is the second letter. In ""BRISK"", R is the second letter -> ✓
   A: not in BRISK -> x
   N: not in BRISK -> x
   E: not in BRISK -> x

 That would give: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x) -> we only get one green R and the rest gray. Not very informative.

 Alternatively, let's consider ""ROAST"":
   R: in BRISK and at position 1? In ""ROAST"", R is first, but in ""BRISK"" R is second -> so it's in the word but wrong position -> (-)
   O: not in BRISK -> x
   A: not in BRISK -> x
   S: in BRISK and at position 4? In ""ROAST"", S is fourth, in ""BRISK"" S is fourth? Actually, BRISK: positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:S, 5:K -> so S is fourth -> ✓
   T: not in BRISK -> x

 So feedback: R(-) O(x) A(x) S(✓) T(x) -> we get one green S and one yellow R.

 Another common word is ""SLATE"":
   S: in BRISK at position 4 -> but in SLATE, S is first -> so yellow (-)
   L: not in BRISK -> x
   A: not in BRISK -> x
   T: not in BRISK -> x
   E: not in BRISK -> x
 -> only one yellow S.

 How about ""STARE"":
   S: in BRISK -> position: in STARE S is first, in BRISK S is fourth -> yellow (-)
   T: not in BRISK -> x
   A: not in BRISK -> x
   R: in BRISK and at position 2? In STARE, R is fourth -> but in BRISK R is second -> so yellow (-)
   E: not in BRISK -> x
 -> two yellows: S and R.

 That's better than just one.

 But note: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 Another popular starting word is ""RAISE"". Let's check for BRISK:
   R: in BRISK at position 2 -> in RAISE, R is first -> yellow (-)
   A: not in BRISK -> x
   I: in BRISK at position 3 -> in RAISE, I is third -> green (✓)
   S: in BRISK at position 4 -> in RAISE, S is fourth -> green (✓)
   E: not in BRISK -> x
 -> feedback: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x) -> two greens and one yellow.

 That's very informative.

 So I think ""RAISE"" is a good starting word because it has three vowels and two common consonants, and in the example it gives good feedback.

 However, note that the example secret word was just an example. We don't know the real word.

 But since we are starting, let's go with ""RAISE"".

 Alternatively, ""ARISE"" is similar and also common.

 But to be consistent, I'll choose ""RAISE"".

 However, let me check the frequency: 
   R, A, I, S, E are all common.

 But note: the word must be valid. ""RAISE"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, I will guess ""RAISE"".For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information by covering common letters and positions. I chose ""RAISE"" because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which frequently appear in 5-letter words. This combination helps test multiple letter positions efficiently, increasing the chances of useful feedback (correct positions, misplaced letters, or exclusions) for subsequent guesses.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback:
- The letters R, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter A is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letter I is in the word but not in the third position (since we guessed it in the third position and it's marked as wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word contains A and I, but not R, S, or E.

Also, note that A and I are not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain R, S, E (since they are not in the word)
- Contains A and I, but not in positions 2 and 3 (because we know they are misplaced from those positions)
- We can include other common letters to test.

Let's think about the positions:
- A is in the word but not at position 2. So A can be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we guessed A at position 2 and it was wrong position, so A is in the word but not at 2. It could be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Similarly, I is in the word but not at position 3. So I can be at 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we have to avoid positions that we know are incorrect for these letters.

We also know that the word does not have R, S, E.

We can consider other common letters: T, O, L, N, U, C, D, M, P, etc.

We want to test as many new letters as possible and also try to place A and I in new positions.

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5

But note: we cannot put A and I in the same position? Well, they are different letters so they will be in different positions.

We should avoid using the same letters again? We must use A and I because they are in the word, but we can use them in different positions.

Let's try to form a word that includes A and I, and three new letters (not R, S, E) and place A and I in positions that are still possible.

For example, we can try to put A at position 1 and I at position 2? But we don't know if that's correct, but we can test.

Alternatively, we can try to put A at position 4 and I at position 5? We have to see what words are possible.

We should also consider that we have two letters that we know are in the word (A and I) and we need to find three more.

But we don't know the other three letters. So we need to test common consonants.

Let me list some common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, O, U, etc.

We can try a word that has A, I, and three of these.

But note: we have to avoid R, S, E.

Let me think of words that have A and I and three new letters.

For example:
- PAINT: P, A, I, N, T -> but note, we have A at position 2 and I at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 2? Wait, in PAINT: A is at position 2 and I at position 3. But our feedback says A is not at position 2 and I is not at position 3. So PAINT would be invalid because we are putting A at 2 and I at 3 again? Actually, we can try to put them in different positions.

We need to avoid position 2 for A and position 3 for I.

So in the new guess, we should put A in one of {1,3,4,5} and I in one of {1,2,4,5}, but not the same position.

Let me try to find a word that has A and I and three new letters, with A not at 2 and I not at 3.

For example:
- If we put A at position 1: then the word starts with A. Then I can be at 2,4,5? But we don't know. Let's see: words like ALOUD? But no I. Or AEGIS? But E is not allowed. We cannot use E.

We need words without R, S, E.

Let me think of words starting with A and containing I: 
- AUDIO: but has E? No, AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O -> no E, no R, no S. But we have A at 1, I at 4? That's good because A is not at 2 and I is not at 3.

But AUDIO: 
  A at 1 -> we don't know if that's correct, but we can test.
  I at 4 -> similarly.

Also, we test U, D, O.

But note: the word has 5 letters: A, U, D, I, O.

Is AUDIO a valid word? Yes.

But let's see if there are other options.

Another word: AVOID: A, V, O, I, D -> A at 1, I at 4? Same as above.

But we can also try to put A at 4 and I at 1? For example: 
- PIANO: but P, I, A, N, O -> I at 1, A at 3. 
  I is at position 1 (which is allowed because we only know it's not at 3) and A at position 3 (which is allowed because we know it's not at 2). 

So PIANO: 
  I at 1 -> new position for I (previously we had I at 3, now at 1)
  A at 3 -> new position for A (previously at 2, now at 3)

Also, we test P, N, O.

But note: we are not sure if I can be at 1 or A at 3, but we are testing.

Another word: PAINT: but that has A at 2 and I at 3, which we know are wrong, so we avoid.

What about PLAIT? P, L, A, I, T -> A at 3, I at 4? 
  A at 3: allowed (since not 2)
  I at 4: allowed (since not 3)

But PLAIT is a word? Yes, meaning a braid.

But we also have to consider that we are testing new letters.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters.

Let me list the letters we haven't tried: 
We have tried: R, A, I, S, E (and R, S, E are out; A and I are in)
So we have 21 other letters to try.

Common ones: T, O, L, N, U, C, D, M, P, etc.

We want to test as many as possible in one go.

In AUDIO: we test A (already known), I (already known), and U, D, O (new). That's three new letters.

In PIANO: we test I, A (known) and P, N, O (new). Also three new.

In PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T -> A and I known, and P, L, T new.

All are good.

But note: we also want to consider the positions. We have two known letters to place, and we want to test them in positions that are still possible.

We know A is not at 2, so we can try A at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
We know I is not at 3, so we can try I at 1, 2, 4, or 5.

In AUDIO: A at 1, I at 4 -> both are new positions for these letters.

In PIANO: I at 1, A at 3 -> also new positions.

In PLAIT: A at 3, I at 4 -> new positions.

Any of these would be fine.

But let's also consider that we might get more information if we can cover more common letters.

The most common letters left: T, O, L, N, etc.

In AUDIO: we have O and U, D (U and D are less common)
In PIANO: we have O, N, P (O and N are very common, P is common)
In PLAIT: we have P, L, T (L and T are very common, P is common)

So PLAIT and PIANO cover more common letters? Actually, T is very common.

But note: we don't know which ones are in the word.

Another word: TALON? But T, A, L, O, N -> but A is at position 2? We cannot put A at position 2 because we know it's not there. So TALON is invalid for A at 2.

What about TOUCH? But no A or I.

We must include A and I.

Another word: MANIA? M, A, N, I, A -> but has two A's? And A at position 2 and 5? We know A is not at 2, so if we put A at 2, it would be wrong. Also, we have A at 5? But we don't know. But the word has two A's? The secret word might have two A's? But we don't know. However, in our feedback, we only have one A marked as present, but it could be that there are two A's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. But in this case, we guessed one A and it was yellow, so there is at least one A. But there could be more.

But to be safe, we should avoid putting A at position 2. So MANIA is not good because it has A at 2.

We can try: ALOIN? A, L, O, I, N -> A at 1, I at 4? And no R,S,E. ALOIN is a word? I think it's a variant of ""aloin"" (a compound). But let's assume it's valid.

But we have to use common words.

Alternatively, we can use ""PIANO"" or ""PLAIT"".

I think ""PIANO"" is a good choice because it is a common word and tests I at position 1 and A at position 3, which are new positions, and also tests P, N, O.

So let's go with ""PIANO"".

But note: in PIANO, we have:
  P at 1, I at 2? No: P-I-A-N-O -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O.

So I is at position 2? That's allowed because we only know I is not at 3. Position 2 is new for I.

Similarly, A is at position 3: we know A is not at 2, but position 3 is new.

So we can use PIANO.

But wait: we have I at position 2 and A at position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Another option: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at 2? Not allowed. We know A is not at 2.

""ADMIN"": A, D, M, I, N -> A at 1, I at 4? That's good. ADMIN is a common word.

ADMIN: A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5.

So A at 1 (new position), I at 4 (new position), and we test D, M, N.

N is very common.

But we are testing D and M which are less common than T or L? But still, it's okay.

Alternatively, ""PAINT"" is not allowed because of positions.

I think both PIANO and ADMIN are good.

But let's choose PIANO because it has O and N, which are more common than D and M? Actually, N is common, O is common.

In PIANO: letters P, I, A, N, O -> I and A known, P, N, O new.

In ADMIN: A, D, M, I, N -> A and I known, D, M, N new.

N is in both. But PIANO has O and P, ADMIN has D and M.

The frequency of letters in English words: 
E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, ...

But we already know A and I are in, and R, S, E are out.

So the most common left are O, T, N, L, C, etc.

T is very common and we haven't tested it. So maybe we should include T.

That's why PLAIT might be better: P, L, A, I, T -> includes T and L.

In PLAIT: 
  P at 1, L at 2, A at 3, I at 4, T at 5.

A at 3 (not 2) and I at 4 (not 3) -> good.

We test P, L, T (all common) and we already know A and I.

So PLAIT tests three new common letters: T, L, P.

Similarly, we could do ""PLANT"" but A at 3? And N at 4, T at 5? But we have I to include. PLANT doesn't have I.

We must include I because we know it's in the word.

So PLAIT is good.

Is PLAIT a valid Wordle word? I think so.

Another word: ""TAXIS"" but has S and S is out.

""OCTAL"" but no A or I.

I think PLAIT is a good choice.

But let me confirm: we have to avoid R, S, E.

PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T -> no R, S, E. Good.

Positions: 
  Position 1: P (new)
  Position 2: L (new) -> but note, we don't have any information about position 2 except that A is not there. So L can be there.
  Position 3: A (we know A is not at 2, but 3 is new)
  Position 4: I (we know I is not at 3, but 4 is new)
  Position 5: T (new)

So we are testing A at 3 and I at 4, which are new positions.

We are also testing P, L, T.

So I think PLAIT is a solid choice.

Alternatively, we could do ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O -> A at 2? Oh, A at position 2 is not allowed. So invalid.

""MATCH"" no I.

So I think PLAIT is good.

But let's see if there's a word that includes T and O? Like POINT? But no A, and we must include A.

We must include both A and I.

Another word: ""PIETA""? P, I, E, T, A -> but E is not allowed, we know E is not in the word.

So avoid.

Therefore, I choose ""PLAIT"".

But note: in PLAIT, we have I at position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

We might get feedback that helps us place A and I.

So second guess: PLAIT.

But let me write it: P-L-A-I-T.

So <guess>PLAIT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, S, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").
- I is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Include **A** and **I** (since they are in the word), but avoid placing A at position 2 or I at position 3.
2. Exclude R, S, and E (since they are not in the word).
3. Test new common letters (like T, L, P) to gather more information.

The word **""PLAIT""** fits these criteria:
- Contains **A** (placed at position 3, avoiding position 2) and **I** (placed at position 4, avoiding position 3).
- Excludes R, S, E.
- Introduces three new common letters: **P**, **L**, and **T**.
- Tests possible positions for A and I while covering high-frequency consonants.

This guess will help narrow down the secret word by checking:
- If A is correctly placed at position 3.
- If I is correctly placed at position 4.
- Whether P, L, or T are in the word and their positions.

The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.\n\n Another popular starting word is ""RAISE"".

""RAISE"" is a valid word.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""RAISE"".For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information by covering common letters and positions. I chose ""RAISE"" because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which frequently appear in 5-letter words. This combination helps test multiple letter positions efficiently, increasing the chances of useful feedback (correct positions, misplaced letters, or exclusions) for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": \n  R: x (not in the word)\n  A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n  I: - (in the word but wrong position)\n  S: x (not in the word)\n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this feedback:\n- The letters R, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n- The letter A is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it\'s marked as wrong position).\n- The letter I is in the word but not in the third position (since we guessed it in the third position and it\'s marked as wrong position).\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains A and I, but not R, S, or E.\n\nAlso, note that A and I are not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess.

M, A, N, I, A -> but has two A\'s? And A at position 2 and 5? We know A is not at 2, so if we put A at 2, it would be wrong. Also, we have A at 5? But we don\'t know. But the word has two A\'s? The secret word might have two A\'s? But we don\'t know. However, in our feedback, we only have one A marked as present, but it could be that there are two A\'s? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. But in this case, we guessed one A and it was yellow, so there is at least one A. But there could be more.\n\nBut to be safe, we should avoid putting A at position 2. So MANIA is not good because it has A at 2.\n\nWe can try: ALOIN? A, L, O, I, N -> A at 1, I at 4? And no R,S,E. ALOIN is a word? I think it\'s a variant of ""aloin"" (a compound). But let\'s assume it\'s valid.\n\nBut we have to use common words.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""PIANO"" or ""PLAIT"".\n\nI think ""PIANO"" is a good choice because it is a common word and tests I at position 1 and A at position 3, which are new positions, and also tests P, N, O.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""PIANO"".\n\nBut note: in PIANO, we have:\n  P at 1, I at 2? No: P-I-A-N-O -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O.\n\nSo I is at position 2? That\'s allowed because we only know I is not at 3. Position 2 is new for I.\n\nSimilarly, A is at position 3: we know A is not at 2, but position 3 is new.\n\nSo we can use PIANO.\n\nBut wait: we have I at position 2 and A at position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\nAnother option: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at 2? Not allowed. We know A is not at 2.\n\n""ADMIN"": A, D, M, I, N -> A at 1, I at 4? That\'s good. ADMIN is a common word.\n\nADMIN: A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5.\n\nSo A at 1 (new position), I at 4 (new position), and we test D, M, N.\n\nN is very common.\n\nBut we are testing D and M which are less common than T or L? But still, it\'s okay.\n\nAlternatively, ""PAINT"" is not allowed because of positions.\n\nI think both PIANO and ADMIN are good.\n\nBut let\'s choose PIANO because it has O and N, which are more common than D and M? Actually, N is common, O is common.\n\nIn PIANO: letters P, I, A, N, O -> I and A known, P, N, O new.\n\nIn ADMIN: A, D, M, I, N -> A and I known, D, M, N new.\n\nN is in both. But PIANO has O and P, ADMIN has D and M.\n\nThe frequency of letters in English words: \nE, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, ...\n\nBut we already know A and I are in, and R, S, E are out.\n\nSo the most common left are O, T, N, L, C, etc.\n\nT is very common and we haven\'t tested it. So maybe we should include T.\n\nThat\'s why PLAIT might be better: P, L, A, I, T -> includes T and L.\n\nIn PLAIT: \n  P at 1, L at 2, A at 3, I at 4, T at 5.\n\nA at 3 (not 2) and I at 4 (not 3) -> good.\n\nWe test P, L, T (all common) and we already know A and I.\n\nSo PLAIT tests three new common letters: T, L, P.\n\nSimilarly, we could do ""PLANT"" but A at 3? And N at 4, T at 5? But we have I to include. PLANT doesn\'t have I.\n\nWe must include I because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nSo PLAIT is good.\n\nIs PLAIT a valid Wordle word? I think so.\n\nAnother word: ""TAXIS"" but has S and S is out.\n\n""OCTAL"" but no A or I.\n\nI think PLAIT is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: we have to avoid R, S, E.\n\nPLAIT: P, L, A, I, T -> no R, S, E. Good.\n\nPositions: \n  Position 1: P (new)\n  Position 2: L (new) -> but note, we don\'t have any information about position 2 except that A is not there. So L can be there.\n  Position 3: A (we know A is not at 2, but 3 is new)\n  Position 4: I (we know I is not at 3, but 4 is new)\n  Position 5: T (new)\n\nSo we are testing A at 3 and I at 4, which are new positions.\n\nWe are also testing P, L, T.\n\nSo I think PLAIT is a solid choice.\n\nAlternatively, we could do ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O -> A at 2? Oh, A at position 2 is not allowed. So invalid.\n\n""MATCH"" no I.\n\nSo I think PLAIT is good.\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word that includes T and O? Like POINT? But no A, and we must include A.\n\nWe must include both A and I.\n\nAnother word: ""PIETA""? P, I, E, T, A -> but E is not allowed, we know E is not in the word.\n\nSo avoid.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""PLAIT"".\n\nBut note: in PLAIT, we have I at position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\nWe might get feedback that helps us place A and I.\n\nSo second guess: PLAIT.\n\nBut let me write it: P-L-A-I-T.\n\nSo <guess>PLAIT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, S, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- A is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").\n- I is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n1. Include **A** and **I** (since they are in the word), but avoid placing A at position 2 or I at position 3.\n2. Exclude R, S, and E (since they are not in the word).\n3. Test new common letters (like T, L, P) to gather more information.\n\nThe word **""PLAIT""** fits these criteria:\n- Contains **A** (placed at position 3, avoiding position 2) and **I** (placed at position 4, avoiding position 3).\n- Excludes R, S, E.\n- Introduces three new common letters: **P**, **L**, and **T**.\n- Tests possible positions for A and I while covering high-frequency consonants.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the secret word by checking:\n- If A is correctly placed at position 3.\n- If I is correctly placed at position 4.\n- Whether P, L, or T are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>PLAIT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PLAIT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1: RAISE
  R(x) -> not in word
  A(-) -> A is in word but not in position 2
  I(-) -> I is in word but not in position 3
  S(x) -> not in word
  E(x) -> not in word

From Guess 2: PLAIT
  P(x) -> not in word
  L(x) -> not in word
  A(-) -> A is in word but not in position 3 (since we placed it at 3 and it's marked wrong position)
  I(✓) -> I is in word and in the correct position! Which is position 4 (since in PLAIT, I is the 4th letter)
  T(x) -> not in word

So, summary of what we know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, P, L, T (from the ""x"" marks)

Letters IN the word:
  - A (in word but not in position 2 or 3)
  - I (fixed at position 4)

Also, from Guess 2, I is confirmed to be at position 4.

Now, since I is at position 4, and A is in the word but not at position 2 (from first guess) or 3 (from second guess), so A cannot be at position 2 or 3.

Possible positions for A: 1, 5 (since positions: 1,2,3,4,5. But 2 and 3 are invalid, and 4 is taken by I, so A can only be at position 1 or 5).

We also know the word has 5 letters, so we need to find the remaining letters.

We have used 8 different letters: R, A, I, S, E, P, L, T (but from the feedback, only A and I are in the word, and the others are out).

So we have 18 letters left to consider.

We know the word contains at least A and I, and I is at position 4.

Therefore, the word looks like: _ _ _ I _

We need to fill the first three positions and the last position.

But A is in one of the positions: 1 or 5.

So two cases:

Case 1: A at position 1 -> word: A _ _ I _
Case 2: A at position 5 -> word: _ _ _ I A

We need to guess a word that includes A (at either position 1 or 5) and I at position 4, and use new letters to test.

Also, we must avoid the letters we know are not in the word: R, S, E, P, L, T.

Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We can choose a word that tests some of these.

Moreover, we want to cover both possibilities for A? But we can only make one guess, so we might have to choose a word that fits one case and tests letters, or we can choose a word that uses A in one of the positions to test which case it is.

For example, if we guess a word with A at position 1, that would help confirm case 1 or rule it out.

Similarly for A at position 5.

Since we have two cases, perhaps we can choose a word that works for one of the cases and uses common letters.

Let's try to form a word for case 1: A at 1 -> word: A _ _ I _

We need two letters for positions 2,3, and one for position 5.

Also, we must avoid the bad letters.

Words starting with A: with I at 4.

For example: A??I? 

Possible words: 
- AUDIO? But we have U, D, O. But AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O -> positions: A1, U2, D3, I4, O5 -> and O is common. But in this case, we test U, D, O.

Another: ACTIN? But C, T, but T is out (from PLAIT feedback). T is not in word.

T is out, so we cannot use T.

Another: AMMIN? Not common.

Or ACNED? But no I.

We need I at position 4.

Another: ABACI? But not 5 letters? ABACI is 5 letters? A-B-A-C-I? Then A at 1 and 3? But we know A is in, but could be duplicated? However, in the feedback, we haven't seen two A's, but it's possible.

ABACI: A at 1, B at 2, A at 3, C at 4, I at 5? No position for I at 4. Messed up.

We must have I at position 4.

So words like: A_B_I? where the fourth letter is I, so pattern: A ? ? I ?

Examples: 
- ALKID? Not common.
- ATOMI? But T and O: T is out.
- ANIMI? Not common.
- AXIOM? But has X and O, and M? But pattern: A, X, I? Positions: If A at 1, X at 2, I at 3? But we need I at 4. AXIOM: A1, X2, I3, O4, M5 -> no, I is at 3, not 4.

We must have the fourth letter as I.

So: A ? ? I ?

Another: ABRIM? But R is out.

ADMIN? We can use ADMIN.

ADMIN: A, D, M, I, N -> positions: A1, D2, M3, I4, N5.

Yes! ADMIN: A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5.

And letters: A, D, M, I, N -> we know A and I are in, but D, M, N are new.

Also, avoids R,S,E,P,L,T.

Is ADMIN a valid word? Yes, common.

Now, case 2: A at position 5. So word: _ _ _ I A

Pattern: ? ? ? I A

Words ending with IA: like MEDIA but E is out. Or RADII but R is out. Also S and E issues.

Possible words: 
- YOGIA? Not common.
- MANGA? Not ending with IA.
- Something like DOLIA? But O, L is out? L is out from PLAIT feedback.

L is out.

Another: BONIA? Not common.

CAMIA? Not common.

HUMIA? Not common.

COLIA? But C, O, L -> L is out.

Most common words ending with IA: like UTOPIA too long.

Actually, 5-letter words ending with I and A? So last two letters must be I A.

But we have position 4 and 5 as I and then A? In this case, position 4 is I, position 5 is A.

So word: _ _ _ I A

Possible: 
- AVIVA? But not standard.
- ANIMA: A are at positions 1 and 5? ANIMA: A1, N2, I3, M4, A5? Then we have I at position 3? But we need I at position 4. No.

The I must be at position 4.

So: letter1, letter2, letter3, I, A.

Examples: 
- NOVIA? N, O, V, I, A -> positions: N1, O2, V3, I4, A5. Valid word? Meaning? Maybe, but less common.
- BONIA? B, O, N, I, A -> B1, O2, N3, I4, A5. BONIA might not be common.
- COVIN? No A.
- DOVIN? No.

Another: FJORD? Not ending with IA.

Perhaps a word like ""MAJIC"" not standard.

More common: MANIA? But M position? MANIA: M1, A2, N3, I4, A5. But A at position 2? We know A cannot be at position 2 from first guess.

In MANIA, A is at position 2, which is invalid.

Similarly, RABBI? But R and B? R is out.

Perhaps ""XYLIA"" but X, Y, L; L is out.

It's hard to find common words ending with I A and avoiding bad letters.

Whereas ADMIN is a very common word.

Therefore, I think ADMIN is a good guess.

Moreover, with ADMIN, we test:
- Case 1 explicitly: A at position 1
- New letters: D, M, N

If A is indeed at position 1, then ADMIN could be the solution.

If not, then we know A must be at position 5, and we rule out ADMIN.

So it's a win-win.

Now, for the guess: ADMIN.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is, say, something else.

But we don't know, so ADMIN is a good test.

So our third guess: ADMIN.

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

- **Analyze feedback from previous guesses:**
  - **Guess 1: RAISE → Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)**
    - Letters **R, S, E** are **not** in the secret word.
    - **Letter A** is in the word but *not* in position 2.
    - **Letter I** is in the word but *not* in position 3.
  - **Guess 2: PLAIT → Feedback: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(x)**
    - Letters **P, L, T** are **not** in the secret word.
    - **Letter A** is in the word but *not* in position 3.
    - **Letter I** is correctly placed at position 4 (fixed).

- **Key deductions:**
  - Letters **excluded**: R, S, E, P, L, T (all marked ""x"").
  - **I** is confirmed in position 4 (e.g., _ _ _ I _).
  - **A** is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (per feedback). Possible positions for A: 1 or 5 (since position 4 is taken by I).
  - Remaining letters to test: Focus on common consonants/vowels not yet tried (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U) and cover both cases for A (position 1 or 5).

- **Strategy for third guess:**
  - Must include **I** at position 4 and **A** at position 1 or 5.
  - Avoid using excluded letters (R,S,E,P,L,T).
  - Prioritize testing **A at position 1** (to resolve ambiguity) and introduce new, common letters for maximum information (e.g., D, M, N).
  - **ADMIN** fits perfectly:
    - Pattern: A (position 1), D (new, position 2), M (new, position 3), I (position 4, correct), N (new, position 5).
    - Tests A at position 1 (if correct, resolves case; if not, A must be at position 5).
    - Tests three new common letters (D, M, N) to check for presence/position.
    - Valid English word and avoids excluded letters.

- **Expected outcomes:**
  - If ADMIN is correct, game ends.
  - If not, feedback will reveal:
    - If A is at position 1 (✓ or -), narrowing A's position.
    - Which of D, M, or N are in the word and their positions.
    - Further constraints for the next guess.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.

 Let me pick ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

 But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", so let's see what feedback we would get with ""CRANE"" for ""BRISK"":
   C: not in BRISK -> x
   R: in BRISK and at the same position? In ""CRANE"", R is the second letter. In ""BRISK"", R is the second letter -> ✓
   A: not in BRISK -> x
   N: not in BRISK -> x
   E: not in BRISK -> x

 That would give: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x) -> we only get one green R and the rest gray. Not very informative.

 Alternatively, let's consider ""ROAST"":
   R: in BRISK and at position 1? In ""ROAST"", R is first, but in ""BRISK"" R is second -> so it's in the word but wrong position -> (-)
   O: not in BRISK -> x
   A: not in BRISK -> x
   S: in BRISK and at position 4? In ""ROAST"", S is fourth, in ""BRISK"" S is fourth? Actually, BRISK: positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:S, 5:K -> so S is fourth -> ✓
   T: not in BRISK -> x

 So feedback: R(-) O(x) A(x) S(✓) T(x) -> we get one green S and one yellow R.

 Another common word is ""SLATE"":
   S: in BRISK at position 4 -> but in SLATE, S is first -> so yellow (-)
   L: not in BRISK -> x
   A: not in BRISK -> x
   T: not in BRISK -> x
   E: not in BRISK -> x
 -> only one yellow S.

 How about ""STARE"":
   S: in BRISK -> position: in STARE S is first, in BRISK S is fourth -> yellow (-)
   T: not in BRISK -> x
   A: not in BRISK -> x
   R: in BRISK and at position 2? In STARE, R is fourth -> but in BRISK R is second -> so yellow (-)
   E: not in BRISK -> x
 -> two yellows: S and R.

 That's better than just one.

 But note: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 Another popular starting word is ""RAISE"". Let's check for BRISK:
   R: in BRISK at position 2 -> in RAISE, R is first -> yellow (-)
   A: not in BRISK -> x
   I: in BRISK at position 3 -> in RAISE, I is third -> green (✓)
   S: in BRISK at position 4 -> in RAISE, S is fourth -> green (✓)
   E: not in BRISK -> x
 -> feedback: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x) -> two greens and one yellow.

 That's very informative.

 So I think ""RAISE"" is a good starting word because it has three vowels and two common consonants, and in the example it gives good feedback.

 However, note that the example secret word was just an example. We don't know the real word.

 But since we are starting, let's go with ""RAISE"".

 Alternatively, ""ARISE"" is similar and also common.

 But to be consistent, I'll choose ""RAISE"".

 However, let me check the frequency: 
   R, A, I, S, E are all common.

 But note: the word must be valid. ""RAISE"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, I will guess ""RAISE"".For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information by covering common letters and positions. I chose ""RAISE"" because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which frequently appear in 5-letter words. This combination helps test multiple letter positions efficiently, increasing the chances of useful feedback (correct positions, misplaced letters, or exclusions) for subsequent guesses.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": 
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  I: - (in the word but wrong position)
  S: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback:
- The letters R, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter A is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letter I is in the word but not in the third position (since we guessed it in the third position and it's marked as wrong position).

Therefore, the secret word contains A and I, but not R, S, or E.

Also, note that A and I are not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Does not contain R, S, E (since they are not in the word)
- Contains A and I, but not in positions 2 and 3 (because we know they are misplaced from those positions)
- We can include other common letters to test.

Let's think about the positions:
- A is in the word but not at position 2. So A can be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we guessed A at position 2 and it was wrong position, so A is in the word but not at 2. It could be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Similarly, I is in the word but not at position 3. So I can be at 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we have to avoid positions that we know are incorrect for these letters.

We also know that the word does not have R, S, E.

We can consider other common letters: T, O, L, N, U, C, D, M, P, etc.

We want to test as many new letters as possible and also try to place A and I in new positions.

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5

But note: we cannot put A and I in the same position? Well, they are different letters so they will be in different positions.

We should avoid using the same letters again? We must use A and I because they are in the word, but we can use them in different positions.

Let's try to form a word that includes A and I, and three new letters (not R, S, E) and place A and I in positions that are still possible.

For example, we can try to put A at position 1 and I at position 2? But we don't know if that's correct, but we can test.

Alternatively, we can try to put A at position 4 and I at position 5? We have to see what words are possible.

We should also consider that we have two letters that we know are in the word (A and I) and we need to find three more.

But we don't know the other three letters. So we need to test common consonants.

Let me list some common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, O, U, etc.

We can try a word that has A, I, and three of these.

But note: we have to avoid R, S, E.

Let me think of words that have A and I and three new letters.

For example:
- PAINT: P, A, I, N, T -> but note, we have A at position 2 and I at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 2? Wait, in PAINT: A is at position 2 and I at position 3. But our feedback says A is not at position 2 and I is not at position 3. So PAINT would be invalid because we are putting A at 2 and I at 3 again? Actually, we can try to put them in different positions.

We need to avoid position 2 for A and position 3 for I.

So in the new guess, we should put A in one of {1,3,4,5} and I in one of {1,2,4,5}, but not the same position.

Let me try to find a word that has A and I and three new letters, with A not at 2 and I not at 3.

For example:
- If we put A at position 1: then the word starts with A. Then I can be at 2,4,5? But we don't know. Let's see: words like ALOUD? But no I. Or AEGIS? But E is not allowed. We cannot use E.

We need words without R, S, E.

Let me think of words starting with A and containing I: 
- AUDIO: but has E? No, AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O -> no E, no R, no S. But we have A at 1, I at 4? That's good because A is not at 2 and I is not at 3.

But AUDIO: 
  A at 1 -> we don't know if that's correct, but we can test.
  I at 4 -> similarly.

Also, we test U, D, O.

But note: the word has 5 letters: A, U, D, I, O.

Is AUDIO a valid word? Yes.

But let's see if there are other options.

Another word: AVOID: A, V, O, I, D -> A at 1, I at 4? Same as above.

But we can also try to put A at 4 and I at 1? For example: 
- PIANO: but P, I, A, N, O -> I at 1, A at 3. 
  I is at position 1 (which is allowed because we only know it's not at 3) and A at position 3 (which is allowed because we know it's not at 2). 

So PIANO: 
  I at 1 -> new position for I (previously we had I at 3, now at 1)
  A at 3 -> new position for A (previously at 2, now at 3)

Also, we test P, N, O.

But note: we are not sure if I can be at 1 or A at 3, but we are testing.

Another word: PAINT: but that has A at 2 and I at 3, which we know are wrong, so we avoid.

What about PLAIT? P, L, A, I, T -> A at 3, I at 4? 
  A at 3: allowed (since not 2)
  I at 4: allowed (since not 3)

But PLAIT is a word? Yes, meaning a braid.

But we also have to consider that we are testing new letters.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters.

Let me list the letters we haven't tried: 
We have tried: R, A, I, S, E (and R, S, E are out; A and I are in)
So we have 21 other letters to try.

Common ones: T, O, L, N, U, C, D, M, P, etc.

We want to test as many as possible in one go.

In AUDIO: we test A (already known), I (already known), and U, D, O (new). That's three new letters.

In PIANO: we test I, A (known) and P, N, O (new). Also three new.

In PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T -> A and I known, and P, L, T new.

All are good.

But note: we also want to consider the positions. We have two known letters to place, and we want to test them in positions that are still possible.

We know A is not at 2, so we can try A at 1, 3, 4, or 5.
We know I is not at 3, so we can try I at 1, 2, 4, or 5.

In AUDIO: A at 1, I at 4 -> both are new positions for these letters.

In PIANO: I at 1, A at 3 -> also new positions.

In PLAIT: A at 3, I at 4 -> new positions.

Any of these would be fine.

But let's also consider that we might get more information if we can cover more common letters.

The most common letters left: T, O, L, N, etc.

In AUDIO: we have O and U, D (U and D are less common)
In PIANO: we have O, N, P (O and N are very common, P is common)
In PLAIT: we have P, L, T (L and T are very common, P is common)

So PLAIT and PIANO cover more common letters? Actually, T is very common.

But note: we don't know which ones are in the word.

Another word: TALON? But T, A, L, O, N -> but A is at position 2? We cannot put A at position 2 because we know it's not there. So TALON is invalid for A at 2.

What about TOUCH? But no A or I.

We must include A and I.

Another word: MANIA? M, A, N, I, A -> but has two A's? And A at position 2 and 5? We know A is not at 2, so if we put A at 2, it would be wrong. Also, we have A at 5? But we don't know. But the word has two A's? The secret word might have two A's? But we don't know. However, in our feedback, we only have one A marked as present, but it could be that there are two A's? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. But in this case, we guessed one A and it was yellow, so there is at least one A. But there could be more.

But to be safe, we should avoid putting A at position 2. So MANIA is not good because it has A at 2.

We can try: ALOIN? A, L, O, I, N -> A at 1, I at 4? And no R,S,E. ALOIN is a word? I think it's a variant of ""aloin"" (a compound). But let's assume it's valid.

But we have to use common words.

Alternatively, we can use ""PIANO"" or ""PLAIT"".

I think ""PIANO"" is a good choice because it is a common word and tests I at position 1 and A at position 3, which are new positions, and also tests P, N, O.

So let's go with ""PIANO"".

But note: in PIANO, we have:
  P at 1, I at 2? No: P-I-A-N-O -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O.

So I is at position 2? That's allowed because we only know I is not at 3. Position 2 is new for I.

Similarly, A is at position 3: we know A is not at 2, but position 3 is new.

So we can use PIANO.

But wait: we have I at position 2 and A at position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Another option: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at 2? Not allowed. We know A is not at 2.

""ADMIN"": A, D, M, I, N -> A at 1, I at 4? That's good. ADMIN is a common word.

ADMIN: A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5.

So A at 1 (new position), I at 4 (new position), and we test D, M, N.

N is very common.

But we are testing D and M which are less common than T or L? But still, it's okay.

Alternatively, ""PAINT"" is not allowed because of positions.

I think both PIANO and ADMIN are good.

But let's choose PIANO because it has O and N, which are more common than D and M? Actually, N is common, O is common.

In PIANO: letters P, I, A, N, O -> I and A known, P, N, O new.

In ADMIN: A, D, M, I, N -> A and I known, D, M, N new.

N is in both. But PIANO has O and P, ADMIN has D and M.

The frequency of letters in English words: 
E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, ...

But we already know A and I are in, and R, S, E are out.

So the most common left are O, T, N, L, C, etc.

T is very common and we haven't tested it. So maybe we should include T.

That's why PLAIT might be better: P, L, A, I, T -> includes T and L.

In PLAIT: 
  P at 1, L at 2, A at 3, I at 4, T at 5.

A at 3 (not 2) and I at 4 (not 3) -> good.

We test P, L, T (all common) and we already know A and I.

So PLAIT tests three new common letters: T, L, P.

Similarly, we could do ""PLANT"" but A at 3? And N at 4, T at 5? But we have I to include. PLANT doesn't have I.

We must include I because we know it's in the word.

So PLAIT is good.

Is PLAIT a valid Wordle word? I think so.

Another word: ""TAXIS"" but has S and S is out.

""OCTAL"" but no A or I.

I think PLAIT is a good choice.

But let me confirm: we have to avoid R, S, E.

PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T -> no R, S, E. Good.

Positions: 
  Position 1: P (new)
  Position 2: L (new) -> but note, we don't have any information about position 2 except that A is not there. So L can be there.
  Position 3: A (we know A is not at 2, but 3 is new)
  Position 4: I (we know I is not at 3, but 4 is new)
  Position 5: T (new)

So we are testing A at 3 and I at 4, which are new positions.

We are also testing P, L, T.

So I think PLAIT is a solid choice.

Alternatively, we could do ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O -> A at 2? Oh, A at position 2 is not allowed. So invalid.

""MATCH"" no I.

So I think PLAIT is good.

But let's see if there's a word that includes T and O? Like POINT? But no A, and we must include A.

We must include both A and I.

Another word: ""PIETA""? P, I, E, T, A -> but E is not allowed, we know E is not in the word.

So avoid.

Therefore, I choose ""PLAIT"".

But note: in PLAIT, we have I at position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

We might get feedback that helps us place A and I.

So second guess: PLAIT.

But let me write it: P-L-A-I-T.

So <guess>PLAIT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, S, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").
- I is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Include **A** and **I** (since they are in the word), but avoid placing A at position 2 or I at position 3.
2. Exclude R, S, and E (since they are not in the word).
3. Test new common letters (like T, L, P) to gather more information.

The word **""PLAIT""** fits these criteria:
- Contains **A** (placed at position 3, avoiding position 2) and **I** (placed at position 4, avoiding position 3).
- Excludes R, S, E.
- Introduces three new common letters: **P**, **L**, and **T**.
- Tests possible positions for A and I while covering high-frequency consonants.

This guess will help narrow down the secret word by checking:
- If A is correctly placed at position 3.
- If I is correctly placed at position 4.
- Whether P, L, or T are in the word and their positions.

<guess>PLAIT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAIT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1: RAISE
  R(x) -> not in word
  A(-) -> A is in word but not in position 2
  I(-) -> I is in word but not in position 3
  S(x) -> not in word
  E(x) -> not in word

From Guess 2: PLAIT
  P(x) -> not in word
  L(x) -> not in word
  A(-) -> A is in word but not in position 3 (since we placed it at 3 and it's marked wrong position)
  I(✓) -> I is in word and in the correct position! Which is position 4 (since in PLAIT, I is the 4th letter)
  T(x) -> not in word

So, summary of what we know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, P, L, T (from the ""x"" marks)

Letters IN the word:
  - A (in word but not in position 2 or 3)
  - I (fixed at position 4)

Also, from Guess 2, I is confirmed to be at position 4.

Now, since I is at position 4, and A is in the word but not at position 2 (from first guess) or 3 (from second guess), so A cannot be at position 2 or 3.

Possible positions for A: 1, 5 (since positions: 1,2,3,4,5. But 2 and 3 are invalid, and 4 is taken by I, so A can only be at position 1 or 5).

We also know the word has 5 letters, so we need to find the remaining letters.

We have used 8 different letters: R, A, I, S, E, P, L, T (but from the feedback, only A and I are in the word, and the others are out).

So we have 18 letters left to consider.

We know the word contains at least A and I, and I is at position 4.

Therefore, the word looks like: _ _ _ I _

We need to fill the first three positions and the last position.

But A is in one of the positions: 1 or 5.

So two cases:

Case 1: A at position 1 -> word: A _ _ I _
Case 2: A at position 5 -> word: _ _ _ I A

We need to guess a word that includes A (at either position 1 or 5) and I at position 4, and use new letters to test.

Also, we must avoid the letters we know are not in the word: R, S, E, P, L, T.

Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We can choose a word that tests some of these.

Moreover, we want to cover both possibilities for A? But we can only make one guess, so we might have to choose a word that fits one case and tests letters, or we can choose a word that uses A in one of the positions to test which case it is.

For example, if we guess a word with A at position 1, that would help confirm case 1 or rule it out.

Similarly for A at position 5.

Since we have two cases, perhaps we can choose a word that works for one of the cases and uses common letters.

Let's try to form a word for case 1: A at 1 -> word: A _ _ I _

We need two letters for positions 2,3, and one for position 5.

Also, we must avoid the bad letters.

Words starting with A: with I at 4.

For example: A??I? 

Possible words: 
- AUDIO? But we have U, D, O. But AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O -> positions: A1, U2, D3, I4, O5 -> and O is common. But in this case, we test U, D, O.

Another: ACTIN? But C, T, but T is out (from PLAIT feedback). T is not in word.

T is out, so we cannot use T.

Another: AMMIN? Not common.

Or ACNED? But no I.

We need I at position 4.

Another: ABACI? But not 5 letters? ABACI is 5 letters? A-B-A-C-I? Then A at 1 and 3? But we know A is in, but could be duplicated? However, in the feedback, we haven't seen two A's, but it's possible.

ABACI: A at 1, B at 2, A at 3, C at 4, I at 5? No position for I at 4. Messed up.

We must have I at position 4.

So words like: A_B_I? where the fourth letter is I, so pattern: A ? ? I ?

Examples: 
- ALKID? Not common.
- ATOMI? But T and O: T is out.
- ANIMI? Not common.
- AXIOM? But has X and O, and M? But pattern: A, X, I? Positions: If A at 1, X at 2, I at 3? But we need I at 4. AXIOM: A1, X2, I3, O4, M5 -> no, I is at 3, not 4.

We must have the fourth letter as I.

So: A ? ? I ?

Another: ABRIM? But R is out.

ADMIN? We can use ADMIN.

ADMIN: A, D, M, I, N -> positions: A1, D2, M3, I4, N5.

Yes! ADMIN: A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5.

And letters: A, D, M, I, N -> we know A and I are in, but D, M, N are new.

Also, avoids R,S,E,P,L,T.

Is ADMIN a valid word? Yes, common.

Now, case 2: A at position 5. So word: _ _ _ I A

Pattern: ? ? ? I A

Words ending with IA: like MEDIA but E is out. Or RADII but R is out. Also S and E issues.

Possible words: 
- YOGIA? Not common.
- MANGA? Not ending with IA.
- Something like DOLIA? But O, L is out? L is out from PLAIT feedback.

L is out.

Another: BONIA? Not common.

CAMIA? Not common.

HUMIA? Not common.

COLIA? But C, O, L -> L is out.

Most common words ending with IA: like UTOPIA too long.

Actually, 5-letter words ending with I and A? So last two letters must be I A.

But we have position 4 and 5 as I and then A? In this case, position 4 is I, position 5 is A.

So word: _ _ _ I A

Possible: 
- AVIVA? But not standard.
- ANIMA: A are at positions 1 and 5? ANIMA: A1, N2, I3, M4, A5? Then we have I at position 3? But we need I at position 4. No.

The I must be at position 4.

So: letter1, letter2, letter3, I, A.

Examples: 
- NOVIA? N, O, V, I, A -> positions: N1, O2, V3, I4, A5. Valid word? Meaning? Maybe, but less common.
- BONIA? B, O, N, I, A -> B1, O2, N3, I4, A5. BONIA might not be common.
- COVIN? No A.
- DOVIN? No.

Another: FJORD? Not ending with IA.

Perhaps a word like ""MAJIC"" not standard.

More common: MANIA? But M position? MANIA: M1, A2, N3, I4, A5. But A at position 2? We know A cannot be at position 2 from first guess.

In MANIA, A is at position 2, which is invalid.

Similarly, RABBI? But R and B? R is out.

Perhaps ""XYLIA"" but X, Y, L; L is out.

It's hard to find common words ending with I A and avoiding bad letters.

Whereas ADMIN is a very common word.

Therefore, I think ADMIN is a good guess.

Moreover, with ADMIN, we test:
- Case 1 explicitly: A at position 1
- New letters: D, M, N

If A is indeed at position 1, then ADMIN could be the solution.

If not, then we know A must be at position 5, and we rule out ADMIN.

So it's a win-win.

Now, for the guess: ADMIN.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is, say, something else.

But we don't know, so ADMIN is a good test.

So our third guess: ADMIN.### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

- **Analyze feedback from previous guesses:**
  - **Guess 1: RAISE → Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)**
    - Letters **R, S, E** are **not** in the secret word.
    - **Letter A** is in the word but *not* in position 2.
    - **Letter I** is in the word but *not* in position 3.
  - **Guess 2: PLAIT → Feedback: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(x)**
    - Letters **P, L, T** are **not** in the secret word.
    - **Letter A** is in the word but *not* in position 3.
    - **Letter I** is correctly placed at position 4 (fixed).

- **Key deductions:**
  - Letters **excluded**: R, S, E, P, L, T (all marked ""x"").
  - **I** is confirmed in position 4 (e.g., _ _ _ I _).
  - **A** is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (per feedback). Possible positions for A: 1 or 5 (since position 4 is taken by I).
  - Remaining letters to test: Focus on common consonants/vowels not yet tried (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U) and cover both cases for A (position 1 or 5).

- **Strategy for third guess:**
  - Must include **I** at position 4 and **A** at position 1 or 5.
  - Avoid using excluded letters (R,S,E,P,L,T).
  - Prioritize testing **A at position 1** (to resolve ambiguity) and introduce new, common letters for maximum information (e.g., D, M, N).
  - **ADMIN** fits perfectly:
    - Pattern: A (position 1), D (new, position 2), M (new, position 3), I (position 4, correct), N (new, position 5).
    - Tests A at position 1 (if correct, resolves case; if not, A must be at position 5).
    - Tests three new common letters (D, M, N) to check for presence/position.
    - Valid English word and avoids excluded letters.

- **Expected outcomes:**
  - If ADMIN is correct, game ends.
  - If not, feedback will reveal:
    - If A is at position 1 (✓ or -), narrowing A's position.
    - Which of D, M, or N are in the word and their positions.
    - Further constraints for the next guess.

Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.\n A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.\n Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. Let\'s choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n However, note that the example in the rules used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but we are free to choose.\n\n Let me pick ""CRANE"" as the first guess.\n\n But note: the example secret word was ""BRISK"", so let\'s see what feedback we would get with ""CRANE"" for ""BRISK"":\n   C: not in BRISK -> x\n   R: in BRISK and at the same position? In ""CRANE"", R is the second letter. In ""BRISK"", R is the second letter -> ✓\n   A: not in BRISK -> x\n   N: not in BRISK -> x\n   E: not in BRISK -> x\n\n That would give: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x) -> we only get one green R and the rest gray. Not very informative.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s consider ""ROAST"":\n   R: in BRISK and at position 1? In ""ROAST"", R is first, but in ""BRISK"" R is second -> so it\'s in the word but wrong position -> (-)\n   O: not in BRISK -> x\n   A: not in BRISK -> x\n   S: in BRISK and at position 4? In ""ROAST"", S is fourth, in ""BRISK"" S is fourth? Actually, BRISK: positions: 1:B, 2:R, 3:I, 4:S, 5:K -> so S is fourth -> ✓\n   T: not in BRISK -> x\n\n So feedback: R(-) O(x) A(x) S(✓) T(x) -> we get one green S and one yellow R.\n\n Another common word is ""SLATE"":\n   S: in BRISK at position 4 -> but in SLATE, S is first -> so yellow (-)\n   L: not in BRISK -> x\n   A: not in BRISK -> x\n   T: not in BRISK -> x\n   E: not in BRISK -> x\n -> only one yellow S.\n\n How about ""STARE"":\n   S: in BRISK -> position: in STARE S is first, in BRISK S is fourth -> yellow (-)\n   T: not in BRISK -> x\n   A: not in BRISK -> x\n   R: in BRISK and at position 2? In STARE, R is fourth -> but in BRISK R is second -> so yellow (-)\n   E: not in BRISK -> x\n -> two yellows: S and R.\n\n That\'s better than just one.\n\n But note: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.\n\n Another popular starting word is ""RAISE"". Let\'s check for BRISK:\n   R: in BRISK at position 2 -> in RAISE, R is first -> yellow (-)\n   A: not in BRISK -> x\n   I: in BRISK at position 3 -> in RAISE, I is third -> green (✓)\n   S: in BRISK at position 4 -> in RAISE, S is fourth -> green (✓)\n   E: not in BRISK -> x\n -> feedback: R(-) A(x) I(✓) S(✓) E(x) -> two greens and one yellow.\n\n That\'s very informative.\n\n So I think ""RAISE"" is a good starting word because it has three vowels and two common consonants, and in the example it gives good feedback.\n\n However, note that the example secret word was just an example. We don\'t know the real word.\n\n But since we are starting, let\'s go with ""RAISE"".\n\n Alternatively, ""ARISE"" is similar and also common.\n\n But to be consistent, I\'ll choose ""RAISE"".\n\n However, let me check the frequency: \n   R, A, I, S, E are all common.\n\n But note: the word must be valid. ""RAISE"" is a valid word.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""RAISE"".For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes information by covering common letters and positions. I chose ""RAISE"" because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which frequently appear in 5-letter words. This combination helps test multiple letter positions efficiently, increasing the chances of useful feedback (correct positions, misplaced letters, or exclusions) for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": \n  R: x (not in the word)\n  A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n  I: - (in the word but wrong position)\n  S: x (not in the word)\n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this feedback:\n- The letters R, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n- The letter A is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it\'s marked as wrong position).\n- The letter I is in the word but not in the third position (since we guessed it in the third position and it\'s marked as wrong position).\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains A and I, but not R, S, or E.\n\nAlso, note that A and I are not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.\n\nNow, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Does not contain R, S, E (since they are not in the word)\n- Contains A and I, but not in positions 2 and 3 (because we know they are misplaced from those positions)\n- We can include other common letters to test.\n\nLet\'s think about the positions:\n- A is in the word but not at position 2. So A can be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we guessed A at position 2 and it was wrong position, so A is in the word but not at 2. It could be at 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n- Similarly, I is in the word but not at position 3. So I can be at 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid positions that we know are incorrect for these letters.\n\nWe also know that the word does not have R, S, E.\n\nWe can consider other common letters: T, O, L, N, U, C, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible and also try to place A and I in new positions.\n\nPossible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5\nPossible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5\n\nBut note: we cannot put A and I in the same position? Well, they are different letters so they will be in different positions.\n\nWe should avoid using the same letters again? We must use A and I because they are in the word, but we can use them in different positions.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word that includes A and I, and three new letters (not R, S, E) and place A and I in positions that are still possible.\n\nFor example, we can try to put A at position 1 and I at position 2? But we don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we can test.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put A at position 4 and I at position 5? We have to see what words are possible.\n\nWe should also consider that we have two letters that we know are in the word (A and I) and we need to find three more.\n\nBut we don\'t know the other three letters. So we need to test common consonants.\n\nLet me list some common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, O, U, etc.\n\nWe can try a word that has A, I, and three of these.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid R, S, E.\n\nLet me think of words that have A and I and three new letters.\n\nFor example:\n- PAINT: P, A, I, N, T -> but note, we have A at position 2 and I at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 2? Wait, in PAINT: A is at position 2 and I at position 3. But our feedback says A is not at position 2 and I is not at position 3. So PAINT would be invalid because we are putting A at 2 and I at 3 again? Actually, we can try to put them in different positions.\n\nWe need to avoid position 2 for A and position 3 for I.\n\nSo in the new guess, we should put A in one of {1,3,4,5} and I in one of {1,2,4,5}, but not the same position.\n\nLet me try to find a word that has A and I and three new letters, with A not at 2 and I not at 3.\n\nFor example:\n- If we put A at position 1: then the word starts with A. Then I can be at 2,4,5? But we don\'t know. Let\'s see: words like ALOUD? But no I. Or AEGIS? But E is not allowed. We cannot use E.\n\nWe need words without R, S, E.\n\nLet me think of words starting with A and containing I: \n- AUDIO: but has E? No, AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O -> no E, no R, no S. But we have A at 1, I at 4? That\'s good because A is not at 2 and I is not at 3.\n\nBut AUDIO: \n  A at 1 -> we don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we can test.\n  I at 4 -> similarly.\n\nAlso, we test U, D, O.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 letters: A, U, D, I, O.\n\nIs AUDIO a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are other options.\n\nAnother word: AVOID: A, V, O, I, D -> A at 1, I at 4? Same as above.\n\nBut we can also try to put A at 4 and I at 1? For example: \n- PIANO: but P, I, A, N, O -> I at 1, A at 3. \n  I is at position 1 (which is allowed because we only know it\'s not at 3) and A at position 3 (which is allowed because we know it\'s not at 2). \n\nSo PIANO: \n  I at 1 -> new position for I (previously we had I at 3, now at 1)\n  A at 3 -> new position for A (previously at 2, now at 3)\n\nAlso, we test P, N, O.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if I can be at 1 or A at 3, but we are testing.\n\nAnother word: PAINT: but that has A at 2 and I at 3, which we know are wrong, so we avoid.\n\nWhat about PLAIT? P, L, A, I, T -> A at 3, I at 4? \n  A at 3: allowed (since not 2)\n  I at 4: allowed (since not 3)\n\nBut PLAIT is a word? Yes, meaning a braid.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we are testing new letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover more common letters.\n\nLet me list the letters we haven\'t tried: \nWe have tried: R, A, I, S, E (and R, S, E are out; A and I are in)\nSo we have 21 other letters to try.\n\nCommon ones: T, O, L, N, U, C, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe want to test as many as possible in one go.\n\nIn AUDIO: we test A (already known), I (already known), and U, D, O (new). That\'s three new letters.\n\nIn PIANO: we test I, A (known) and P, N, O (new). Also three new.\n\nIn PLAIT: P, L, A, I, T -> A and I known, and P, L, T new.\n\nAll are good.\n\nBut note: we also want to consider the positions. We have two known letters to place, and we want to test them in positions that are still possible.\n\nWe know A is not at 2, so we can try A at 1, 3, 4, or 5.\nWe know I is not at 3, so we can try I at 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nIn AUDIO: A at 1, I at 4 -> both are new positions for these letters.\n\nIn PIANO: I at 1, A at 3 -> also new positions.\n\nIn PLAIT: A at 3, I at 4 -> new positions.\n\nAny of these would be fine.\n\nBut let\'s also consider that we might get more information if we can cover more common letters.\n\nThe most common letters left: T, O, L, N, etc.\n\nIn AUDIO: we have O and U, D (U and D are less common)\nIn PIANO: we have O, N, P (O and N are very common, P is common)\nIn PLAIT: we have P, L, T (L and T are very common, P is common)\n\nSo PLAIT and PIANO cover more common letters? Actually, T is very common.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know which ones are in the word.\n\nAnother word: TALON? But T, A, L, O, N -> but A is at position 2? We cannot put A at position 2 because we know it\'s not there. So TALON is invalid for A at 2.\n\nWhat about TOUCH? But no A or I.\n\nWe must include A and I.\n\nAnother word: MANIA? M, A, N, I, A -> but has two A\'s? And A at position 2 and 5? We know A is not at 2, so if we put A at 2, it would be wrong. Also, we have A at 5? But we don\'t know. But the word has two A\'s? The secret word might have two A\'s? But we don\'t know. However, in our feedback, we only have one A marked as present, but it could be that there are two A\'s? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. But in this case, we guessed one A and it was yellow, so there is at least one A. But there could be more.\n\nBut to be safe, we should avoid putting A at position 2. So MANIA is not good because it has A at 2.\n\nWe can try: ALOIN? A, L, O, I, N -> A at 1, I at 4? And no R,S,E. ALOIN is a word? I think it\'s a variant of ""aloin"" (a compound). But let\'s assume it\'s valid.\n\nBut we have to use common words.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""PIANO"" or ""PLAIT"".\n\nI think ""PIANO"" is a good choice because it is a common word and tests I at position 1 and A at position 3, which are new positions, and also tests P, N, O.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""PIANO"".\n\nBut note: in PIANO, we have:\n  P at 1, I at 2? No: P-I-A-N-O -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:A, 4:N, 5:O.\n\nSo I is at position 2? That\'s allowed because we only know I is not at 3. Position 2 is new for I.\n\nSimilarly, A is at position 3: we know A is not at 2, but position 3 is new.\n\nSo we can use PIANO.\n\nBut wait: we have I at position 2 and A at position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\nAnother option: ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> A at 2? Not allowed. We know A is not at 2.\n\n""ADMIN"": A, D, M, I, N -> A at 1, I at 4? That\'s good. ADMIN is a common word.\n\nADMIN: A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5.\n\nSo A at 1 (new position), I at 4 (new position), and we test D, M, N.\n\nN is very common.\n\nBut we are testing D and M which are less common than T or L? But still, it\'s okay.\n\nAlternatively, ""PAINT"" is not allowed because of positions.\n\nI think both PIANO and ADMIN are good.\n\nBut let\'s choose PIANO because it has O and N, which are more common than D and M? Actually, N is common, O is common.\n\nIn PIANO: letters P, I, A, N, O -> I and A known, P, N, O new.\n\nIn ADMIN: A, D, M, I, N -> A and I known, D, M, N new.\n\nN is in both. But PIANO has O and P, ADMIN has D and M.\n\nThe frequency of letters in English words: \nE, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, ...\n\nBut we already know A and I are in, and R, S, E are out.\n\nSo the most common left are O, T, N, L, C, etc.\n\nT is very common and we haven\'t tested it. So maybe we should include T.\n\nThat\'s why PLAIT might be better: P, L, A, I, T -> includes T and L.\n\nIn PLAIT: \n  P at 1, L at 2, A at 3, I at 4, T at 5.\n\nA at 3 (not 2) and I at 4 (not 3) -> good.\n\nWe test P, L, T (all common) and we already know A and I.\n\nSo PLAIT tests three new common letters: T, L, P.\n\nSimilarly, we could do ""PLANT"" but A at 3? And N at 4, T at 5? But we have I to include. PLANT doesn\'t have I.\n\nWe must include I because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nSo PLAIT is good.\n\nIs PLAIT a valid Wordle word? I think so.\n\nAnother word: ""TAXIS"" but has S and S is out.\n\n""OCTAL"" but no A or I.\n\nI think PLAIT is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: we have to avoid R, S, E.\n\nPLAIT: P, L, A, I, T -> no R, S, E. Good.\n\nPositions: \n  Position 1: P (new)\n  Position 2: L (new) -> but note, we don\'t have any information about position 2 except that A is not there. So L can be there.\n  Position 3: A (we know A is not at 2, but 3 is new)\n  Position 4: I (we know I is not at 3, but 4 is new)\n  Position 5: T (new)\n\nSo we are testing A at 3 and I at 4, which are new positions.\n\nWe are also testing P, L, T.\n\nSo I think PLAIT is a solid choice.\n\nAlternatively, we could do ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O -> A at 2? Oh, A at position 2 is not allowed. So invalid.\n\n""MATCH"" no I.\n\nSo I think PLAIT is good.\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word that includes T and O? Like POINT? But no A, and we must include A.\n\nWe must include both A and I.\n\nAnother word: ""PIETA""? P, I, E, T, A -> but E is not allowed, we know E is not in the word.\n\nSo avoid.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""PLAIT"".\n\nBut note: in PLAIT, we have I at position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\nWe might get feedback that helps us place A and I.\n\nSo second guess: PLAIT.\n\nBut let me write it: P-L-A-I-T.\n\nSo <guess>PLAIT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, S, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- A is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").\n- I is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n1. Include **A** and **I** (since they are in the word), but avoid placing A at position 2 or I at position 3.\n2. Exclude R, S, and E (since they are not in the word).\n3. Test new common letters (like T, L, P) to gather more information.\n\nThe word **""PLAIT""** fits these criteria:\n- Contains **A** (placed at position 3, avoiding position 2) and **I** (placed at position 4, avoiding position 3).\n- Excludes R, S, E.\n- Introduces three new common letters: **P**, **L**, and **T**.\n- Tests possible positions for A and I while covering high-frequency consonants.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the secret word by checking:\n- If A is correctly placed at position 3.\n- If I is correctly placed at position 4.\n- Whether P, L, or T are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>PLAIT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PLAIT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from two guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1: RAISE\n  R(x) -> not in word\n  A(-) -> A is in word but not in position 2\n  I(-) -> I is in word but not in position 3\n  S(x) -> not in word\n  E(x) -> not in word\n\nFrom Guess 2: PLAIT\n  P(x) -> not in word\n  L(x) -> not in word\n  A(-) -> A is in word but not in position 3 (since we placed it at 3 and it\'s marked wrong position)\n  I(✓) -> I is in word and in the correct position!

But 2 and 3 are invalid, and 4 is taken by I, so A can only be at position 1 or 5).\n\nWe also know the word has 5 letters, so we need to find the remaining letters.\n\nWe have used 8 different letters: R, A, I, S, E, P, L, T (but from the feedback, only A and I are in the word, and the others are out).\n\nSo we have 18 letters left to consider.\n\nWe know the word contains at least A and I, and I is at position 4.\n\nTherefore, the word looks like: _ _ _ I _\n\nWe need to fill the first three positions and the last position.\n\nBut A is in one of the positions: 1 or 5.\n\nSo two cases:\n\nCase 1: A at position 1 -> word: A _ _ I _\nCase 2: A at position 5 -> word: _ _ _ I A\n\nWe need to guess a word that includes A (at either position 1 or 5) and I at position 4, and use new letters to test.\n\nAlso, we must avoid the letters we know are not in the word: R, S, E, P, L, T.\n\nCommon remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe can choose a word that tests some of these.\n\nMoreover, we want to cover both possibilities for A? But we can only make one guess, so we might have to choose a word that fits one case and tests letters, or we can choose a word that uses A in one of the positions to test which case it is.\n\nFor example, if we guess a word with A at position 1, that would help confirm case 1 or rule it out.\n\nSimilarly for A at position 5.\n\nSince we have two cases, perhaps we can choose a word that works for one of the cases and uses common letters.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word for case 1: A at 1 -> word: A _ _ I _\n\nWe need two letters for positions 2,3, and one for position 5.\n\nAlso, we must avoid the bad letters.\n\nWords starting with A: with I at 4.\n\nFor example: A??I? \n\nPossible words: \n- AUDIO? But we have U, D, O. But AUDIO: A, U, D, I, O -> positions: A1, U2, D3, I4, O5 -> and O is common. But in this case, we test U, D, O.\n\nAnother: ACTIN? But C, T, but T is out (from PLAIT feedback). T is not in word.\n\nT is out, so we cannot use T.\n\nAnother: AMMIN? Not common.\n\nOr ACNED? But no I.\n\nWe need I at position 4.\n\nAnother: ABACI? But not 5 letters? ABACI is 5 letters? A-B-A-C-I? Then A at 1 and 3? But we know A is in, but could be duplicated? However, in the feedback, we haven\'t seen two A\'s, but it\'s possible.\n\nABACI: A at 1, B at 2, A at 3, C at 4, I at 5? No position for I at 4. Messed up.\n\nWe must have I at position 4.\n\nSo words like: A_B_I? where the fourth letter is I, so pattern: A ? ? I ?\n\nExamples: \n- ALKID? Not common.\n- ATOMI? But T and O: T is out.\n- ANIMI? Not common.\n- AXIOM? But has X and O, and M? But pattern: A, X, I? Positions: If A at 1, X at 2, I at 3? But we need I at 4. AXIOM: A1, X2, I3, O4, M5 -> no, I is at 3, not 4.\n\nWe must have the fourth letter as I.\n\nSo: A ? ? I ?\n\nAnother: ABRIM? But R is out.\n\nADMIN? We can use ADMIN.\n\nADMIN: A, D, M, I, N -> positions: A1, D2, M3, I4, N5.\n\nYes! ADMIN: A at 1, D at 2, M at 3, I at 4, N at 5.\n\nAnd letters: A, D, M, I, N -> we know A and I are in, but D, M, N are new.\n\nAlso, avoids R,S,E,P,L,T.\n\nIs ADMIN a valid word? Yes, common.\n\nNow, case 2: A at position 5. So word: _ _ _ I A\n\nPattern: ? ? ? I A\n\nWords ending with IA: like MEDIA but E is out. Or RADII but R is out. Also S and E issues.\n\nPossible words: \n- YOGIA? Not common.\n- MANGA? Not ending with IA.\n- Something like DOLIA? But O, L is out? L is out from PLAIT feedback.\n\nL is out.\n\nAnother: BONIA? Not common.\n\nCAMIA? Not common.\n\nHUMIA? Not common.\n\nCOLIA? But C, O, L -> L is out.\n\nMost common words ending with IA: like UTOPIA too long.\n\nActually, 5-letter words ending with I and A? So last two letters must be I A.\n\nBut we have position 4 and 5 as I and then A? In this case, position 4 is I, position 5 is A.\n\nSo word: _ _ _ I A\n\nPossible: \n- AVIVA? But not standard.\n- ANIMA: A are at positions 1 and 5? ANIMA: A1, N2, I3, M4, A5? Then we have I at position 3? But we need I at position 4. No.\n\nThe I must be at position 4.\n\nSo: letter1, letter2, letter3, I, A.\n\nExamples: \n- NOVIA? N, O, V, I, A -> positions: N1, O2, V3, I4, A5. Valid word? Meaning? Maybe, but less common.\n- BONIA? B, O, N, I, A -> B1, O2, N3, I4, A5. BONIA might not be common.\n- COVIN? No A.\n- DOVIN? No.\n\nAnother: FJORD? Not ending with IA.\n\nPerhaps a word like ""MAJIC"" not standard.\n\nMore common: MANIA? But M position? MANIA: M1, A2, N3, I4, A5. But A at position 2? We know A cannot be at position 2 from first guess.\n\nIn MANIA, A is at position 2, which is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, RABBI? But R and B? R is out.\n\nPerhaps ""XYLIA"" but X, Y, L; L is out.\n\nIt\'s hard to find common words ending with I A and avoiding bad letters.\n\nWhereas ADMIN is a very common word.\n\nTherefore, I think ADMIN is a good guess.\n\nMoreover, with ADMIN, we test:\n- Case 1 explicitly: A at position 1\n- New letters: D, M, N\n\nIf A is indeed at position 1, then ADMIN could be the solution.\n\nIf not, then we know A must be at position 5, and we rule out ADMIN.\n\nSo it\'s a win-win.\n\nNow, for the guess: ADMIN.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we would get if the word is, say, something else.\n\nBut we don\'t know, so ADMIN is a good test.\n\nSo our third guess: ADMIN.### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n\n- **Analyze feedback from previous guesses:**\n  - **Guess 1: RAISE → Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)**\n    - Letters **R, S, E** are **not** in the secret word.\n    - **Letter A** is in the word but *not* in position 2.\n    - **Letter I** is in the word but *not* in position 3.\n  - **Guess 2: PLAIT → Feedback: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(x)**\n    - Letters **P, L, T** are **not** in the secret word.\n    - **Letter A** is in the word but *not* in position 3.\n    - **Letter I** is correctly placed at position 4 (fixed).\n\n- **Key deductions:**\n  - Letters **excluded**: R, S, E, P, L, T (all marked ""x"").\n  - **I** is confirmed in position 4 (e.g., _ _ _ I _).\n  - **A** is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (per feedback). Possible positions for A: 1 or 5 (since position 4 is taken by I).\n  - Remaining letters to test: Focus on common consonants/vowels not yet tried (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U) and cover both cases for A (position 1 or 5).\n\n- **Strategy for third guess:**\n  - Must include **I** at position 4 and **A** at position 1 or 5.\n  - Avoid using excluded letters (R,S,E,P,L,T).\n  - Prioritize testing **A at position 1** (to resolve ambiguity) and introduce new, common letters for maximum information (e.g., D, M, N).\n  - **ADMIN** fits perfectly:\n    - Pattern: A (position 1), D (new, position 2), M (new, position 3), I (position 4, correct), N (new, position 5).\n    - Tests A at position 1 (if correct, resolves case; if not, A must be at position 5).\n    - Tests three new common letters (D, M, N) to check for presence/position.\n    - Valid English word and avoids excluded letters.\n\n- **Expected outcomes:**\n  - If ADMIN is correct, game ends.\n  - If not, feedback will reveal:\n    - If A is at position 1 (✓ or -), narrowing A\'s position.\n    - Which of D, M, or N are in the word and their positions.\n    - Further constraints for the next guess.\n\n<guess>ADMIN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PLAIT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: ADMIN -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) M(x) I(✓) N(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)
  - R, S, E are not in the word.
  - A is in the word but not at position 2.
  - I is in the word but not at position 3.

Guess 2: PLAIT -> P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(x)
  - P, L, T are not in the word.
  - A is in the word but not at position 3.
  - I is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.

Guess 3: ADMIN -> A(✓) D(x) M(x) I(✓) N(x)
  - A is in the word and correctly placed at position 1 (since in ADMIN, A is first).
  - D, M, N are not in the word.
  - I is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.

So now we know:
- The word has A at position 1 and I at position 4: so the pattern is A _ _ I _
- Excluded letters: R, S, E, P, L, T, D, M, N (all marked x in at least one guess)
- We have two positions to fill: position 2 and position 3, and position 5 is the last one? Actually, the word is 5 letters: 1:A, 2:?, 3:?, 4:I, 5:?

But note: we also know that A is at position 1 (so not elsewhere) and I at position 4 (so not elsewhere). We don't know about duplicates, but so far no indication.

Now, we need to find which letters can go in positions 2, 3, and 5.

We have excluded: R, S, E, P, L, T, D, M, N.

So the remaining letters are: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that starts with A, has I at position 4, and uses the remaining letters.

The word pattern: A ? ? I ?

We must avoid the excluded letters.

We have two positions to fill: 2, 3, and 5.

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

Common letters that are left: O, U, C, H, K, etc.

We can try to think of words that fit: A _ _ I _

For example:
- AFFIX? But F and X: A, F, F, I, X -> but we have two F's? And F is not excluded yet. But let's see: positions: A1, F2, F3, I4, X5. But we don't know if F is in the word.

But we need to test new letters.

Another: AXIOM? But X, I, O, M: but M is excluded (from ADMIN feedback: M(x)). So not allowed.

Another: AUDIO? But U, D, I, O: D is excluded (from ADMIN: D(x)). So not allowed.

Another: AWAIT? But A, W, A, I, T -> T is excluded (from PLAIT: T(x)). Not allowed.

Another: ALOIN? But L and O: L is excluded (from PLAIT: L(x)). Not allowed.

Another: ABACI? But B, A, C, I -> but ABACI: A1, B2, A3, C4, I5? But we need I at position 4, not 5. And C4? Then I would be at 5, but we have I fixed at 4. So not.

We need the fourth letter to be I.

So: A ? ? I ?

Another: ACRID? But C, R, I, D: R and D are excluded. R from RAISE (R(x)), D from ADMIN (D(x)).

Another: AGILE? But G, I, L, E: L and E are excluded.

Another: AWHIR? But W, H, I, R: R is excluded.

Another: AZOIC? A, Z, O, I, C -> A1, Z2, O3, I4, C5. This uses Z, O, C. None of these are excluded? Let's check: Z, O, C are not in the excluded list. Excluded: R,S,E,P,L,T,D,M,N. So Z, O, C are allowed.

Is AZOIC a valid word? It means relating to life, and it's accepted in some dictionaries. But it might be obscure.

Another: AVOID? A, V, O, I, D -> but D is excluded.

Another: ATOLL? But T, O, L: T and L excluded.

Another: ABHOR? But B, H, O, R: R excluded.

Another: ACINI? But A, C, I, N, I: N excluded, and also it has two I's? But we have I at position 4, so if we put I at 5, that might be okay if the word has two I's. But in ACINI: A1, C2, I3, N4, I5 -> but we need I at position 4, not 3 and 5. So not.

We need position 4 to be I, so the word must have I only at position 4? Or could it have another I? We don't know, but we have to place I at 4.

So the pattern must be A ? ? I ?

Another: AORTA? But O, R, T, A: R and T excluded.

Another: AUGUR? But U, G, U, R: R excluded.

Another: AWASH? But W, A, S, H: S excluded.

Another: AXION? A, X, I, O, N -> but N excluded, and also I is at position 3? AXION: A1, X2, I3, O4, N5 -> but we need I at position 4, not 3. So not.

We must have the third letter as something else and I at 4.

So: A ? ? I ?

Let me list possible words:

- ACRID: excluded letters
- ADMIT: D and M excluded
- AGLOW: L excluded
- AHEAD: E excluded? E is excluded, but AHEAD: A, H, E, A, D -> E and D excluded.
- ALIKE: L and E excluded
- ALOFT: L excluded
- ALOUD: L excluded
- AMASS: M and S excluded
- AMAZE: M and E and Z? But M and E excluded.
- AMBER: M and E excluded
- AMEND: M, E, D excluded
- AMISS: M and S excluded

- AUDIO: D excluded
- AUDIT: D, T excluded
- AVAST: S, T excluded
- AVERT: E, R, T excluded
- AVOID: D excluded
- AWAIT: T excluded
- AWAKE: K, E excluded? A, W, A, K, E -> E excluded, and K is not excluded? But E is excluded.
- AWARD: R, D excluded
- AWASH: S excluded
- AWFUL: F, U, L -> L excluded
- AXIAL: X, I, A, L -> L excluded
- AXION: N excluded and I at 3
- AZOIC: A, Z, O, I, C -> no excluded letters? Z, O, C are not excluded.

So AZOIC might be a candidate.

Another: B is not excluded, so what about words like ABACI? But ABACI: A, B, A, C, I -> positions: A1, B2, A3, C4, I5 -> but we need I at 4, not 5. So not.

ABHOR: R excluded.

ABOIL: B, O, I, L -> L excluded.

ABUZZ: B, U, Z, Z -> but Z is not excluded, but the word is A, B, U, Z, Z? But we need I at position 4. ABUZZ has no I.

We need I at position 4.

Another: ACINI: N excluded and I at 3 and 5.

ADMIN: already guessed.

Perhaps ""AFIRE"": A, F, I, R, E -> R and E excluded.

AGAIN: G, A, I, N -> N excluded, and I at position 3? AGAIN: A1, G2, A3, I4, N5? Wait, positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N. But N is excluded, and also we have A at 1 and 3? But we know A is at 1, so if there is another A, it's possible, but N is excluded.

So not.

Another: ALBUM: L excluded.

ALIEN: L, E, N excluded.

ALIGN: L, G, N excluded.

ALIKE: L, E excluded.

ALIVE: L, V, E -> L and E excluded.

ALOHA: L, O, H, A -> L excluded.

ALPHA: L, P, H, A -> L and P excluded.

ALTAR: L, T, R excluded.

AMAZE: M, E excluded.

AMBER: M, E excluded.

AMIGO: M, G, O -> M excluded.

AMINO: M, N, O -> M and N excluded.

AMISS: M, S excluded.

AMPLY: M, P, L, Y -> M, P, L excluded.

ANIME: N, M, E -> N, M, E excluded.

ANODE: N, D, E excluded.

ANTIC: N, T, C -> N and T excluded.

APPLE: P, L, E excluded.

ARISE: R, S, E excluded.

AROMA: R, O, M -> R and M excluded.

ASCOT: S, C, O, T -> S and T excluded.

ASPEN: S, P, N excluded.

ASSET: S, E, T excluded.

ATONE: T, O, N, E -> T, N, E excluded.

AUDIO: D excluded.

AUNTY: U, N, T, Y -> N and T excluded.

AVAIL: V, A, I, L -> L excluded.

AVERT: E, R, T excluded.

AVID: D excluded, and only 4 letters.

AVOID: D excluded.

AWAIT: T excluded.

AWAKE: E excluded.

AWARD: R, D excluded.

AWASH: S excluded.

AXIAL: L excluded.

AZOIC: A, Z, O, I, C -> as above.

Another: O is not excluded, so what about words like AORTA? R excluded.

Maybe ""O"" can be in position 2 or 3 or 5.

Another word: ACOCK? Not common.

Perhaps ""C"" is common, so let's try to include C.

What about ""ACHOO""? A, C, H, O, O -> but we need I at position 4. ACHOO: A1, C2, H3, O4, O5 -> no I.

Not.

""ACID"": but only 4 letters.

""ACINI"": N excluded.

Another: ""ADOBE"": D excluded.

I think AZOIC is one of the few options.

But let's see if there is a more common word.

What about ""AGONE""? G, O, N, E -> N and E excluded.

""AHIND""? Not common.

""AKING""? K, I, N, G -> N excluded.

""ALKYL"": L excluded.

""AMOWT""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""ANIGH"": N, I, G, H -> N excluded.

""APIOL""? P, I, O, L -> P and L excluded.

""AROID"": R excluded.

""ASPIC"": S, P, C -> S and P excluded.

""ATRIP"": T, R, P excluded.

""AULIC"": L excluded.

""AUMIL""? Not common.

""AURIC"": R excluded.

""AUTOS"": T, S excluded.

""AVION"": V, I, O, N -> N excluded.

""AVISO"": V, I, S, O -> S excluded.

""AVOID"": D excluded.

""AXILE"": X, I, L, E -> L and E excluded.

""AXIOM"": M excluded.

""AXITE"": X, I, T, E -> T and E excluded.

""AZIDE"": D, E excluded.

""AZINE"": N, E excluded.

""AZOLE"": L, E excluded.

""AZOTE"": T, E excluded.

""AZURE"": R, E excluded.

So AZOIC seems to be a valid option, though uncommon.

Another possibility: ""OAKUM""? But O at 1, not A.

We need A at 1.

Perhaps ""KAZOO"" not starting with A.

I think we have to go with AZOIC or similar.

But let's think of words with U, like AURUM? But R excluded.

AULOI? A, U, L, O, I -> L excluded.

AUMIL? Not common.

Another: B is not excluded, so what about ""ABOON""? Not common, and no I at 4.

""ABRIM"": R excluded.

""ABUZZ"": no I.

""ABYES"": E, S excluded.

Perhaps ""ACOCK"": C, O, K -> but no I.

I think we might have to use AZOIC.

But there is another word: ""ACHOO"" no I.

Or ""ACKEE"": K, E, E -> E excluded.

""ADUNC"": D excluded.

""AGAMA"": G, A, M, A -> M excluded.

""AGHAS"": G, H, A, S -> S excluded.

""AGIOS"": G, I, O, S -> S excluded, and I at 3? AGIOS: A1, G2, I3, O4, S5 -> S excluded, and I is at 3, not 4.

Not.

""AGONE"": E and N excluded.

""AGUNA""? Not common.

""AHING"": H, I, N, G -> N excluded.

""AIOLI"": A, I, O, L, I -> L excluded, and I at 2 and 5? But we have I at position 4 fixed, so if there is another I, it's possible, but L is excluded.

A, I, O, L, I: positions: A1, I2, O3, L4, I5 -> but we need I at position 4, not 2 and 5. So not.

""AIZLE""? Not common.

""AJIVA"": J, I, V, A -> J and V not excluded, but I at 3? AJIVA: A1, J2, I3, V4, A5 -> I at 3, not 4.

Not.

""AKELA"": K, E, L, A -> E and L excluded.

""AKING"": N excluded.

""ALACK"": L, C, K -> L excluded.

""ALAMO"": L, A, M, O -> L and M excluded.

""ALAND"": L, A, N, D -> L, N, D excluded.

""ALANS"": L, A, N, S -> L, N, S excluded.

""ALANT"": L, A, N, T -> L, N, T excluded.

""ALAPA"": L, A, P, A -> L and P excluded.

I think it's difficult. Perhaps we should consider that there might be duplicate letters, but we have no evidence.

Another idea: the word might have O in it.

Let's try to list all possible words that fit the pattern A _ _ I _ and use only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For position 2: can be any of these except we have to form a word.

Position 3: similarly.

Position 5: similarly.

For example, position 2: B -> then A B ? I ? 
- ABACI: but I at 5, not 4.
- ABHOR: R excluded.
- ABOON: no I.
- ABRIS: R and S excluded.
- ABRIM: R excluded.
- ABUZZ: no I.

Position 2: C -> A C ? I ?
- ACARI: A, C, A, R, I -> R excluded, and I at 5.
- ACINI: N excluded.
- ACIDY: D excluded? ACIDY is not common.
- ACRID: R and D excluded.

Position 2: F -> A F ? I ?
- AFFIX: A, F, F, I, X -> possible? F at 2 and 3, I at 4, X at 5. And F and X are not excluded.
- AFIRE: R and E excluded.
- AFORE: R and E excluded.
- AFOUL: O, U, L -> L excluded.
- AFROS: F, R, O, S -> R and S excluded.
- AFFIX is a word.

AFFIX: A1, F2, F3, I4, X5.

Letters: F and X are not excluded.

So AFFIX is a valid guess.

Similarly, position 2: G -> A G ? I ?
- AGIOS: S excluded and I at 3.
- AGISM: G, I, S, M -> S and M excluded.
- AGITA: G, I, T, A -> T excluded.
- AGONE: N and E excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: H -> A H ? I ?

- AHIND: H, I, N, D -> N and D excluded.
- AHINT: H, I, N, T -> N and T excluded.
- No good.

- AJIVA: J, I, V, A -> I at 3.
- AJUGA: J, U, G, A -> no I at 4.
- AJWAN: J, W, A, N -> N excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: K -> A K ? I ?
- AKELA: K, E, L, A -> E and L excluded.
- AKING: K, I, N, G -> N excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: O -> A O ? I ?
- AORTA: R and T excluded.
- AOTUS: O, T, U, S -> T and S excluded.
- AOLES: O, L, E, S -> L, E, S excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: Q -> A Q ? I ? 
- AQUAE: Q, U, A, E -> E excluded.
- AQUAS: Q, U, A, S -> S excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: U -> A U ? I ?
- AUDIO: D excluded.
- AULOS: U, L, O, S -> L and S excluded.
- AUMIL: U, M, I, L -> M and L excluded.
- AURIC: R excluded.
- AUTOS: T and S excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: V -> A V ? I ?
- AVANT: V, A, N, T -> N and T excluded.
- AVENS: V, E, N, S -> E, N, S excluded.
- AVERS: V, E, R, S -> E, R, S excluded.
- AVGAS: V, G, A, S -> S excluded.
- AVIAN: V, I, A, N -> N excluded, and I at 3.
- AVION: V, I, O, N -> N excluded, I at 3.
- AVISO: V, I, S, O -> S excluded, I at 3.
- AVOID: D excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: W -> A W ? I ?
- AWARD: R and D excluded.
- AWASH: S excluded.
- AWAIT: T excluded.
- AWAVE: W, A, V, E -> E excluded.
- AWFUL: F, U, L -> L excluded.
- AWING: W, I, N, G -> N excluded.
- AWOKE: W, O, K, E -> E excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: X -> A X ? I ?
- AXIAL: L excluded.
- AXILE: L and E excluded.
- AXILS: L and S excluded.
- AXING: X, I, N, G -> N excluded.
- AXIOM: M excluded.
- AXITE: T and E excluded.
- AXLES: L, E, S excluded.
- AXOID: D excluded.
- AXONS: O, N, S -> N and S excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: Y -> A Y ? I ?
- AYAHU: not common.
- AYELP: E, L, P excluded.
- AYINS: Y, I, N, S -> N and S excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: Z -> A Z ? I ?
- AZANS: S excluded.
- AZIDE: D and E excluded.
- AZIDO: D excluded.
- AZINE: N and E excluded.
- AZLON: L, O, N -> L and N excluded.
- AZOIC: A, Z, O, I, C -> Z at 2, O at 3, I at 4, C at 5.
- AZOLE: L and E excluded.
- AZONS: O, N, S -> N and S excluded.
- AZOTE: T and E excluded.
- AZOTH: T and H -> T excluded.
- AZUKI: Z, U, K, I -> I at 5.
- AZURE: R and E excluded.

So the only words we have are AFFIX and AZOIC.

AFFIX: A, F, F, I, X
AZOIC: A, Z, O, I, C

Both are valid English words, though somewhat less common.

We need to choose one to guess.

Since we have to make a guess, let's go with AFFIX because it has double F, which might be interesting, and F and X are common enough.

But in AFFIX, we have F at positions 2 and 3.

We don't know if F is in the word, but we'll find out.

Similarly, for AZOIC, we have Z, O, C.

Perhaps AFFIX is more common.

But in terms of letter frequency, F is more common than Z.

So I'll go with AFFIX.

So fourth guess: AFFIX

But let's write it.

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

- **Analyze feedback from previous guesses:**
  - **Guess 1: RAISE → Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)**  
    - Letters **R, S, E** are **not** in the secret word.  
    - **A** is in the word but *not* in position 2.  
    - **I** is in the word but *not* in position 3.  
  - **Guess 2: PLAIT → Feedback: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(x)**  
    - Letters **P, L, T** are **not** in the secret word.  
    - **A** is in the word but *not* in position 3.  
    - **I** is correctly placed at position 4 (fixed).  
  - **Guess 3: ADMIN → Feedback: A(✓) D(x) M(x) I(✓) N(x)**  
    - **A** is correctly placed at position 1.  
    - **D, M, N** are **not** in the word.  
    - **I** is confirmed at position 4.  

- **Key deductions:**  
  - **Secret word pattern**: A _ _ I _ (A at position 1, I at position 4).  
  - **Excluded letters (not in word)**: R, S, E, P, L, T, D, M, N (all marked ""x"" in feedback).  
  - **Remaining possible letters**: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  - **Constraints for A and I**:  
    - A is fixed at position 1 (cannot be elsewhere).  
    - I is fixed at position 4 (cannot be elsewhere).  
    - No duplicates indicated, so assume no additional A or I for now.  
  - **Positions to solve**: 2, 3, and 5.  

- **Strategy for fourth guess**:  
  - Must start with **A**, end with **I** at position 4, and have a valid letter in position 5.  
  - Avoid all excluded letters.  
  - Test new high-frequency consonants (e.g., F, C, O) to maximize information.  
  - **Possible words**: After evaluating remaining letters, two valid options emerge:  
    - **AFFIX** (A, F, F, I, X): Tests F (double) and X.  
    - **AZOIC** (A, Z, O, I, C): Tests Z, O, and C.  
  - **Why choose AFFIX?**  
    - F is more common than Z in English words, increasing the chance of getting feedback.  
    - Double F tests for duplicate letters (if F is in the word, feedback will reveal if duplicates exist).  
    - X is less common but provides broad coverage.  
    - AFFIX is a valid English word (meaning: to attach or secure).  

- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If AFFIX is correct, the game ends.  
  - If not, feedback will:  
    - Confirm if F is in the word (and if duplicated).  
    - Reveal if X is in the word.  
    - Narrow down position 5 (currently X in AFFIX).  
    - Further constrain possibilities for the next guess (e.g., if F is excluded, focus on C, O, etc.).  

<guess>AFFIX</guess>",AFFIX,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)
  - R, S, E are not in the word.
  - A is in the word but not at position 2.
  - I is in the word but not at position 3.

Guess 2: PLAIT -> P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(x)
  - P, L, T are not in the word.
  - A is in the word but not at position 3.
  - I is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.

Guess 3: ADMIN -> A(✓) D(x) M(x) I(✓) N(x)
  - A is in the word and correctly placed at position 1 (since in ADMIN, A is first).
  - D, M, N are not in the word.
  - I is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.

So now we know:
- The word has A at position 1 and I at position 4: so the pattern is A _ _ I _
- Excluded letters: R, S, E, P, L, T, D, M, N (all marked x in at least one guess)
- We have two positions to fill: position 2 and position 3, and position 5 is the last one? Actually, the word is 5 letters: 1:A, 2:?, 3:?, 4:I, 5:?

But note: we also know that A is at position 1 (so not elsewhere) and I at position 4 (so not elsewhere). We don't know about duplicates, but so far no indication.

Now, we need to find which letters can go in positions 2, 3, and 5.

We have excluded: R, S, E, P, L, T, D, M, N.

So the remaining letters are: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that starts with A, has I at position 4, and uses the remaining letters.

The word pattern: A ? ? I ?

We must avoid the excluded letters.

We have two positions to fill: 2, 3, and 5.

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

Common letters that are left: O, U, C, H, K, etc.

We can try to think of words that fit: A _ _ I _

For example:
- AFFIX? But F and X: A, F, F, I, X -> but we have two F's? And F is not excluded yet. But let's see: positions: A1, F2, F3, I4, X5. But we don't know if F is in the word.

But we need to test new letters.

Another: AXIOM? But X, I, O, M: but M is excluded (from ADMIN feedback: M(x)). So not allowed.

Another: AUDIO? But U, D, I, O: D is excluded (from ADMIN: D(x)). So not allowed.

Another: AWAIT? But A, W, A, I, T -> T is excluded (from PLAIT: T(x)). Not allowed.

Another: ALOIN? But L and O: L is excluded (from PLAIT: L(x)). Not allowed.

Another: ABACI? But B, A, C, I -> but ABACI: A1, B2, A3, C4, I5? But we need I at position 4, not 5. And C4? Then I would be at 5, but we have I fixed at 4. So not.

We need the fourth letter to be I.

So: A ? ? I ?

Another: ACRID? But C, R, I, D: R and D are excluded. R from RAISE (R(x)), D from ADMIN (D(x)).

Another: AGILE? But G, I, L, E: L and E are excluded.

Another: AWHIR? But W, H, I, R: R is excluded.

Another: AZOIC? A, Z, O, I, C -> A1, Z2, O3, I4, C5. This uses Z, O, C. None of these are excluded? Let's check: Z, O, C are not in the excluded list. Excluded: R,S,E,P,L,T,D,M,N. So Z, O, C are allowed.

Is AZOIC a valid word? It means relating to life, and it's accepted in some dictionaries. But it might be obscure.

Another: AVOID? A, V, O, I, D -> but D is excluded.

Another: ATOLL? But T, O, L: T and L excluded.

Another: ABHOR? But B, H, O, R: R excluded.

Another: ACINI? But A, C, I, N, I: N excluded, and also it has two I's? But we have I at position 4, so if we put I at 5, that might be okay if the word has two I's. But in ACINI: A1, C2, I3, N4, I5 -> but we need I at position 4, not 3 and 5. So not.

We need position 4 to be I, so the word must have I only at position 4? Or could it have another I? We don't know, but we have to place I at 4.

So the pattern must be A ? ? I ?

Another: AORTA? But O, R, T, A: R and T excluded.

Another: AUGUR? But U, G, U, R: R excluded.

Another: AWASH? But W, A, S, H: S excluded.

Another: AXION? A, X, I, O, N -> but N excluded, and also I is at position 3? AXION: A1, X2, I3, O4, N5 -> but we need I at position 4, not 3. So not.

We must have the third letter as something else and I at 4.

So: A ? ? I ?

Let me list possible words:

- ACRID: excluded letters
- ADMIT: D and M excluded
- AGLOW: L excluded
- AHEAD: E excluded? E is excluded, but AHEAD: A, H, E, A, D -> E and D excluded.
- ALIKE: L and E excluded
- ALOFT: L excluded
- ALOUD: L excluded
- AMASS: M and S excluded
- AMAZE: M and E and Z? But M and E excluded.
- AMBER: M and E excluded

- ATTIC: T excluded
- AUDIO: D excluded
- AUDIT: D, T excluded
- AVAST: S, T excluded
- AVERT: E, R, T excluded
- AVOID: D excluded
- AWAIT: T excluded
- AWAKE: K, E excluded? A, W, A, K, E -> E excluded, and K is not excluded? But E is excluded.
- AWARD: R, D excluded
- AWASH: S excluded
- AWFUL: F, U, L -> L excluded
- AXIAL: X, I, A, L -> L excluded
- AXION: N excluded and I at 3
- AZOIC: A, Z, O, I, C -> no excluded letters? Z, O, C are not excluded.

So AZOIC might be a candidate.

Another: B is not excluded, so what about words like ABACI? But ABACI: A, B, A, C, I -> positions: A1, B2, A3, C4, I5 -> but we need I at 4, not 5. So not.

ABHOR: R excluded.

ABOIL: B, O, I, L -> L excluded.

ABUZZ: B, U, Z, Z -> but Z is not excluded, but the word is A, B, U, Z, Z? But we need I at position 4. ABUZZ has no I.

We need I at position 4.

Another: ACINI: N excluded and I at 3 and 5.

ADMIN: already guessed.

Perhaps ""AFIRE"": A, F, I, R, E -> R and E excluded.

AGAIN: G, A, I, N -> N excluded, and I at position 3? AGAIN: A1, G2, A3, I4, N5? Wait, positions: 1:A, 2:G, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N. But N is excluded, and also we have A at 1 and 3? But we know A is at 1, so if there is another A, it's possible, but N is excluded.

So not.

Another: ALBUM: L excluded.

ALIEN: L, E, N excluded.

ALIGN: L, G, N excluded.

ALIKE: L, E excluded.

ALIVE: L, V, E -> L and E excluded.

ALOHA: L, O, H, A -> L excluded.

ALPHA: L, P, H, A -> L and P excluded.

ALTAR: L, T, R excluded.

AMAZE: M, E excluded.

AMBER: M, E excluded.

AMIGO: M, G, O -> M excluded.

AMINO: M, N, O -> M and N excluded.

AMISS: M, S excluded.

AMPLY: M, P, L, Y -> M, P, L excluded.

ANIME: N, M, E -> N, M, E excluded.

ANODE: N, D, E excluded.

ANTIC: N, T, C -> N and T excluded.

APPLE: P, L, E excluded.

ARISE: R, S, E excluded.

AROMA: R, O, M -> R and M excluded.

ASCOT: S, C, O, T -> S and T excluded.

ASPEN: S, P, N excluded.

ASSET: S, E, T excluded.

ATONE: T, O, N, E -> T, N, E excluded.

AUDIO: D excluded.

AUNTY: U, N, T, Y -> N and T excluded.

AVAIL: V, A, I, L -> L excluded.

AVERT: E, R, T excluded.

AVID: D excluded, and only 4 letters.

AVOID: D excluded.

AWAIT: T excluded.

AWAKE: E excluded.

AWARD: R, D excluded.

AWASH: S excluded.

AXIAL: L excluded.

AZOIC: A, Z, O, I, C -> as above.

Another: O is not excluded, so what about words like AORTA? R excluded.

Maybe ""O"" can be in position 2 or 3 or 5.

Another word: ACOCK? Not common.

Perhaps ""C"" is common, so let's try to include C.

What about ""ACHOO""? A, C, H, O, O -> but we need I at position 4. ACHOO: A1, C2, H3, O4, O5 -> no I.

Not.

""ACID"": but only 4 letters.

""ACINI"": N excluded.

Another: ""ADOBE"": D excluded.

I think AZOIC is one of the few options.

But let's see if there is a more common word.

What about ""AGONE""? G, O, N, E -> N and E excluded.

""AHIND""? Not common.

""AKING""? K, I, N, G -> N excluded.

""ALKYL"": L excluded.

""AMOWT""? Not a word.

Perhaps ""ANIGH"": N, I, G, H -> N excluded.

""APIOL""? P, I, O, L -> P and L excluded.

""AROID"": R excluded.

""ASPIC"": S, P, C -> S and P excluded.

""ATRIP"": T, R, P excluded.

""AULIC"": L excluded.

""AUMIL""? Not common.

""AURIC"": R excluded.

""AUTOS"": T, S excluded.

""AVION"": V, I, O, N -> N excluded.

""AVISO"": V, I, S, O -> S excluded.

""AVOID"": D excluded.

""AXILE"": X, I, L, E -> L and E excluded.

""AXIOM"": M excluded.

""AXITE"": X, I, T, E -> T and E excluded.

""AZIDE"": D, E excluded.

""AZINE"": N, E excluded.

""AZOLE"": L, E excluded.

""AZOTE"": T, E excluded.

""AZURE"": R, E excluded.

So AZOIC seems to be a valid option, though uncommon.

Another possibility: ""OAKUM""? But O at 1, not A.

We need A at 1.

Perhaps ""KAZOO"" not starting with A.

I think we have to go with AZOIC or similar.

But let's think of words with U, like AURUM? But R excluded.

AULOI? A, U, L, O, I -> L excluded.

AUMIL? Not common.

Another: B is not excluded, so what about ""ABOON""? Not common, and no I at 4.

""ABRIM"": R excluded.

""ABUZZ"": no I.

""ABYES"": E, S excluded.

Perhaps ""ACOCK"": C, O, K -> but no I.

I think we might have to use AZOIC.

But there is another word: ""ACHOO"" no I.

Or ""ACKEE"": K, E, E -> E excluded.

""ADUNC"": D excluded.

""AGAMA"": G, A, M, A -> M excluded.

""AGHAS"": G, H, A, S -> S excluded.

""AGIOS"": G, I, O, S -> S excluded, and I at 3? AGIOS: A1, G2, I3, O4, S5 -> S excluded, and I is at 3, not 4.

Not.

""AGONE"": E and N excluded.

""AGUNA""? Not common.

""AHING"": H, I, N, G -> N excluded.

""AIOLI"": A, I, O, L, I -> L excluded, and I at 2 and 5? But we have I at position 4 fixed, so if there is another I, it's possible, but L is excluded.

A, I, O, L, I: positions: A1, I2, O3, L4, I5 -> but we need I at position 4, not 2 and 5. So not.

""AIZLE""? Not common.

""AJIVA"": J, I, V, A -> J and V not excluded, but I at 3? AJIVA: A1, J2, I3, V4, A5 -> I at 3, not 4.

Not.

""AKELA"": K, E, L, A -> E and L excluded.

""AKING"": N excluded.

""ALACK"": L, C, K -> L excluded.

""ALAMO"": L, A, M, O -> L and M excluded.

""ALAND"": L, A, N, D -> L, N, D excluded.

""ALANS"": L, A, N, S -> L, N, S excluded.

""ALANT"": L, A, N, T -> L, N, T excluded.

""ALAPA"": L, A, P, A -> L and P excluded.

I think it's difficult. Perhaps we should consider that there might be duplicate letters, but we have no evidence.

Another idea: the word might have O in it.

Let's try to list all possible words that fit the pattern A _ _ I _ and use only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For position 2: can be any of these except we have to form a word.

Position 3: similarly.

Position 5: similarly.

For example, position 2: B -> then A B ? I ? 
- ABACI: but I at 5, not 4.
- ABHOR: R excluded.
- ABOON: no I.
- ABRIS: R and S excluded.
- ABRIM: R excluded.
- ABUZZ: no I.

Position 2: C -> A C ? I ?
- ACARI: A, C, A, R, I -> R excluded, and I at 5.
- ACINI: N excluded.
- ACIDY: D excluded? ACIDY is not common.
- ACRID: R and D excluded.

Position 2: F -> A F ? I ?
- AFFIX: A, F, F, I, X -> possible? F at 2 and 3, I at 4, X at 5. And F and X are not excluded.
- AFIRE: R and E excluded.
- AFORE: R and E excluded.
- AFOUL: O, U, L -> L excluded.
- AFROS: F, R, O, S -> R and S excluded.
- AFFIX is a word.

AFFIX: A1, F2, F3, I4, X5.

Letters: F and X are not excluded.

So AFFIX is a valid guess.

Similarly, position 2: G -> A G ? I ?
- AGIOS: S excluded and I at 3.
- AGISM: G, I, S, M -> S and M excluded.
- AGITA: G, I, T, A -> T excluded.
- AGONE: N and E excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: H -> A H ? I ?
- AHIGH: H, I, G, H -> G and H, but I at 3? A, H, I, G, H -> positions: A1, H2, I3, G4, H5 -> I at 3, not 4.
- AHIND: H, I, N, D -> N and D excluded.
- AHINT: H, I, N, T -> N and T excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: J -> A J ? I ?
- AJIVA: J, I, V, A -> I at 3.
- AJUGA: J, U, G, A -> no I at 4.
- AJWAN: J, W, A, N -> N excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: K -> A K ? I ?
- AKELA: K, E, L, A -> E and L excluded.
- AKING: K, I, N, G -> N excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: O -> A O ? I ?
- AORTA: R and T excluded.
- AOTUS: O, T, U, S -> T and S excluded.
- AOLES: O, L, E, S -> L, E, S excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: Q -> A Q ? I ? 
- AQUAE: Q, U, A, E -> E excluded.
- AQUAS: Q, U, A, S -> S excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: U -> A U ? I ?
- AUDIO: D excluded.
- AULOS: U, L, O, S -> L and S excluded.
- AUMIL: U, M, I, L -> M and L excluded.
- AURIC: R excluded.
- AUTOS: T and S excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: V -> A V ? I ?
- AVANT: V, A, N, T -> N and T excluded.
- AVENS: V, E, N, S -> E, N, S excluded.
- AVERS: V, E, R, S -> E, R, S excluded.
- AVGAS: V, G, A, S -> S excluded.
- AVIAN: V, I, A, N -> N excluded, and I at 3.
- AVION: V, I, O, N -> N excluded, I at 3.
- AVISO: V, I, S, O -> S excluded, I at 3.
- AVOID: D excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: W -> A W ? I ?
- AWARD: R and D excluded.
- AWASH: S excluded.
- AWAIT: T excluded.
- AWAVE: W, A, V, E -> E excluded.
- AWFUL: F, U, L -> L excluded.
- AWING: W, I, N, G -> N excluded.
- AWOKE: W, O, K, E -> E excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: X -> A X ? I ?
- AXIAL: L excluded.
- AXILE: L and E excluded.
- AXILS: L and S excluded.
- AXING: X, I, N, G -> N excluded.
- AXIOM: M excluded.
- AXITE: T and E excluded.
- AXLES: L, E, S excluded.
- AXOID: D excluded.
- AXONS: O, N, S -> N and S excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: Y -> A Y ? I ?
- AYAHU: not common.
- AYELP: E, L, P excluded.
- AYINS: Y, I, N, S -> N and S excluded.
- No good.

Position 2: Z -> A Z ? I ?
- AZANS: S excluded.
- AZIDE: D and E excluded.
- AZIDO: D excluded.
- AZINE: N and E excluded.
- AZLON: L, O, N -> L and N excluded.
- AZOIC: A, Z, O, I, C -> Z at 2, O at 3, I at 4, C at 5.
- AZOLE: L and E excluded.
- AZONS: O, N, S -> N and S excluded.
- AZOTE: T and E excluded.
- AZOTH: T and H -> T excluded.
- AZUKI: Z, U, K, I -> I at 5.
- AZURE: R and E excluded.

So the only words we have are AFFIX and AZOIC.

AFFIX: A, F, F, I, X
AZOIC: A, Z, O, I, C

Both are valid English words, though somewhat less common.

We need to choose one to guess.

Since we have to make a guess, let's go with AFFIX because it has double F, which might be interesting, and F and X are common enough.

But in AFFIX, we have F at positions 2 and 3.

We don't know if F is in the word, but we'll find out.

Similarly, for AZOIC, we have Z, O, C.

Perhaps AFFIX is more common.

But in terms of letter frequency, F is more common than Z.

So I'll go with AFFIX.

So fourth guess: AFFIX

But let's write it.### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

- **Analyze feedback from previous guesses:**
  - **Guess 1: RAISE → Feedback: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)**  
    - Letters **R, S, E** are **not** in the secret word.  
    - **A** is in the word but *not* in position 2.  
    - **I** is in the word but *not* in position 3.  
  - **Guess 2: PLAIT → Feedback: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(x)**  
    - Letters **P, L, T** are **not** in the secret word.  
    - **A** is in the word but *not* in position 3.  
    - **I** is correctly placed at position 4 (fixed).  
  - **Guess 3: ADMIN → Feedback: A(✓) D(x) M(x) I(✓) N(x)**  
    - **A** is correctly placed at position 1.  
    - **D, M, N** are **not** in the word.  
    - **I** is confirmed at position 4.  

- **Key deductions:**  
  - **Secret word pattern**: A _ _ I _ (A at position 1, I at position 4).  
  - **Excluded letters (not in word)**: R, S, E, P, L, T, D, M, N (all marked ""x"" in feedback).  
  - **Remaining possible letters**: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  - **Constraints for A and I**:  
    - A is fixed at position 1 (cannot be elsewhere).  
    - I is fixed at position 4 (cannot be elsewhere).  
    - No duplicates indicated, so assume no additional A or I for now.  
  - **Positions to solve**: 2, 3, and 5.  

- **Strategy for fourth guess**:  
  - Must start with **A**, end with **I** at position 4, and have a valid letter in position 5.  
  - Avoid all excluded letters.  
  - Test new high-frequency consonants (e.g., F, C, O) to maximize information.  
  - **Possible words**: After evaluating remaining letters, two valid options emerge:  
    - **AFFIX** (A, F, F, I, X): Tests F (double) and X.  
    - **AZOIC** (A, Z, O, I, C): Tests Z, O, and C.  
  - **Why choose AFFIX?**  
    - F is more common than Z in English words, increasing the chance of getting feedback.  
    - Double F tests for duplicate letters (if F is in the word, feedback will reveal if duplicates exist).  
    - X is less common but provides broad coverage.  
    - AFFIX is a valid English word (meaning: to attach or secure).  

- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If AFFIX is correct, the game ends.  
  - If not, feedback will:  
    - Confirm if F is in the word (and if duplicated).  
    - Reveal if X is in the word.  
    - Narrow down position 5 (currently X in AFFIX).  
    - Further constrain possibilities for the next guess (e.g., if F is excluded, focus on C, O, etc.).",Guess 4: AFFIX -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) F(✓) F(✓) I(✓) X(✓),SUCCESS
