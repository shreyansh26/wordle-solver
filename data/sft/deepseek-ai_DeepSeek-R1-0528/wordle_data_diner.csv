We are starting the game. For the first guess, we want to choose a word that can give us as much information as possible.
 Typically, a good starting word has:
   - Common letters (vowels and frequent consonants)
   - No repeating letters

 Common starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, RAISE, etc.

 Let's choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. ""RAISE"" is a popular choice because it has 'R', 'A', 'I', 'S', 'E' — all common letters.

 But note: the feedback mechanism does not reveal duplicate letters explicitly? And the secret word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't specify, but commonly words can have duplicates.

 However, for maximum information, we avoid duplicates in the first guess.

 My first guess: RAISE

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize information. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"" are often effective as they contain frequently used letters. 

I'll select ""RAISE"" as it:
- Includes three vowels (A, I, E) 
- Uses common consonants (R, S)
- Has no repeated letters
- Covers frequent letters in English 5-letter words

This choice should provide useful feedback about:

We are given the feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": 
R -> (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
A -> (x) meaning A is not in the word.
I -> (-) meaning I is in the word but in the wrong position.
S -> (x) meaning S is not in the word.
E -> (-) meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, from this feedback:
- The secret word contains the letters: R, I, E (but not in the positions they were in RAISE)
- The secret word does NOT contain: A, S.

Also note: Since R is in the word but not in position 1 (because we got - for R in first position), similarly I is not in position 3, E is not in position 5.

Now, the positions in RAISE:
Position 1: R -> wrong position (but present)
Position 2: A -> absent
Position 3: I -> wrong position (but present)
Position 4: S -> absent
Position 5: E -> wrong position (but present)

So we know:
- R must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5? Wait, no: positions are fixed. The R is in the secret word but not at position 1. Similarly, I is not at position 3, and E is not at position 5.

Moreover, since A and S are absent, we can rule out any word containing A or S.

Now, for the next guess:
- We want to use the known letters: R, I, E and avoid A and S.
- We also want to try placing R, I, E in different positions to test their correct positions.

Also, we need to choose a word that is 5 letters and doesn't have A or S.

Known present letters: R, I, E.

We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test positions.

Let's think of common words that contain R, I, E and without the letters A or S.

Possible letters? We can try to cover more common consonants.

For example, we know:
- Position 2 of the secret word is not A (and A is absent so any letter is okay except A and S, but we must include R, I, E).

Wait, the secret word doesn't have A or S, so we can only use letters from the remaining 24 letters.

We have three known letters: R, I, E. So the word must have R, I, E and two other letters? Not necessarily, because the word might have duplicate letters? But note: in the feedback, if there were duplicates, it might show accordingly? However, in RAISE we don't have duplicates.

But the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates explicitly? Actually, the rules say that if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets -, regardless of duplicates? But if the secret word has two of a letter and the guess has one, then the one that matches position gets ✓ and the other might get - or x? Actually, the standard Wordle rule: each letter in the guess is matched individually. But for duplicate letters, the feedback can be tricky.

However, in our first guess, we didn't get any duplicate feedback issue.

But note: we have three known letters: R, I, E. The secret word could have duplicates? But for now, assuming no duplicates in the secret word? We don't know.

But we must form a word with R, I, E and two other letters, without A and S.

Also, we must avoid placing R at position 1, I at position 3, E at position 5.

So let's try to form words:

- R cannot be at position 1? But in the next guess we can put R elsewhere? Actually, we must put R somewhere else because it cannot be at position 1 (since in RAISE R was at 1 and got -).

Similarly, I cannot be at position 3? And E cannot be at position 5.

Now, position 1: cannot be R? Actually, the feedback says R is present but not at position 1, so in the secret word, R is at position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, I is not at position 3: so it can be at 1,2,4,5? But wait, we haven't tested position 1 for I? Actually, we have no information on position 1 except that it's not R? It could be I? Yes.

Similarly, E is not at position 5: so it can be at 1,2,3,4.

But note: we also know that the secret word has the letters R, I, E and two others (or possibly duplicates? but we don't know).

We want to try a word that uses these three letters in different positions and adds two new letters.

Let me think of words that contain R, I, E, and exclude A and S.

Common possibilities: words like ""RIVET"", ""TRIED"", ""PRICE"", ""BRINE"", ""CRIER"", ""DRIVE"", etc.

But we need to choose one that places R, I, E in positions we haven't ruled out.

Consider the constraints:

- Position 1: cannot be R (from first feedback). So if I put I at position 1, that's okay? Yes.

Similarly, we can test E at position 1? That's allowed.

Let's list:

Option: Use ""TRIED"":
- T at 1: new letter
- R at 2: but in RAISE, we had R at 1 which was wrong, but R at 2? We don't know.
It might be okay to put R at 2? Because in the next position we can get information.

But note: we also haven't tested any of the other positions? So why not.

But let me check the word ""TRIED"":
Position 1: T (new)
Position 2: R (we know R is in the word, but we haven't checked position 2 before? We only checked position 1 for R and found it was wrong. So putting R at position 2 is a possibility? Yes.

Similarly, I at position 3: but wait, in the first guess I was at position 3 and got - meaning it's not at 3. So if we put I at position 3 again, it will still be wrong? Unless we haven't changed the position? Actually, we already know it's not at position 3? So putting it again at 3 might be inefficient? But we get feedback: if it's at 3 we get ✓? But we already know it's not at 3? Yes, first feedback said I at position 3 was wrong. So we shouldn't put I at position 3? We should put I at a different position.

Similarly, E was at position 5 and wrong, so avoid putting E at 5.

In ""TRIED"": 
Position 3: I -> but we already know I is not at position 3? So if we put it there, we expect it to show - again? Yes, because it's still in the word but not at 3? But if we put I at position 3, we get - meaning it's present but wrong position? But we already know that. It doesn't give us new information? And we lose the chance to test I at another position.

Therefore, we want to put I at a position we don't know: i.e., positions 1,2,4,5? But position 5 we have to avoid E? Actually, we can put I anywhere except 3.

But in ""TRIED"", I is at position 3, which we know is wrong. So that guess wouldn't help us test for position 3? We already know it's not at 3, so it's redundant.

Moreover, E is at position 4: which is new? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5? So testing E at position 4 is okay? Yes.

But we also have E at 4? But the feedback was E not at position 5? So position 4 could be correct for E? Yes.

Alternatively, consider the word ""PRICE"":
Position 1: P (new)
Position 2: R (not position 1, so position 2 we don't know)
Position 3: I (but we know I is not at position 3? So we expect - for I? We already know that? So same issue? Not efficient.)

So we need a word that:
- Has R, I, E (since we must include them? Actually, we don't have to? But we have only three known letters? There are two other letters we don't know? We must use R, I, E because we know they are present? Actually, no: the secret word has R, I, E? So we must have them? Yes? Because they are present? So the next guess must include them? Not necessarily? Why?

Actually, technically, we don't have to include all the known letters? But it's efficient to do so? Because we can test them in new positions.

Moreover, if we don't include a known letter, we don't get information about its position? So we should include them.

So: the next guess should include R, I, E and two new letters? Also, avoid A and S? So yes.

And we need to avoid the positions that we already ruled out: 
- R: not at position 1? And we don't know about positions 2,3,4,5? Actually, positions 1: R cannot be? But we can put R at 2?
We can put R at any position except 1? Since position 1 was tested and wrong? Similarly, I cannot be at 3? So we can put I at 1,2,4,5? And E cannot be at 5? So E at positions 1,2,3,4.

So for our next guess, we want to assign R to a position other than 1, I to a position other than 3, and E to a position other than 5.

Moreover, we use two new letters? And we get feedback on them? So we choose common consonants? And vowel? But we have I and E? So consonants? 

Possible words:

Let me try E at position 1? And R at position 2? Or something else.

For example:
- Position 1: E? (E can be at 1? Yes)
- Position 2: I? (I can be at 2? Yes) but wait, then what about R? We need a place for R.

Example: ""EIRIE""? No, it has duplicate E? Also, EIRIE is five letters? But it's obscure? Not common? We want a valid word.

Another idea: ""BRIEF""?
- B (new) at 1
- R at 2
- I at 3 -> wait, position 3: we know I cannot be at 3? So same issue? So if we put I at 3, we get -? Which we already know? So redundant? We don't get new position? Because when we put I at 3, it's present but wrong? But we know it's not at 3? So we don't get whether it's at 3? We know it's not? So we are wasting a position? So don't put I at 3.

Similarly, avoid putting R at 1? And E at 5? 

Now, BRIEF: 
Position 3: I -> we avoid because we already know I is wrong at position 3? So no.

Alternative: ""CRIER"" -> 
Position 1: C (new)
Position 2: R (test R at 2? Then if R is at 2, we get ✓? But we don't know? Position 2 is new? So okay? But we also have I at position 3 -> we know I is not at 3? So again, I at 3 will give -? which we already know? And E at 4? That's okay? Then R at the end? but there are two R's? 

In ""CRIER"": 
Letters: C, R, I, E, R -> but the secret word? It might have duplicate R? But we don't know? So we have R at position 2 and 5? If we put R at position 2? And R at position 5? But we already know R is in the word? This might complicate.

But also, I at 3: we know it's wrong? So we don't get new information? 

Perhaps a better word: ""DOZER""? But contains S? Wait, not? DOZER: D,O,Z,E,R -> E at position 4? But where is I? Not present? We must have I? Because it's a known letter? Yes? The secret word has I? So we must include I? Otherwise, I will be absent? But we know it's present? So the next guess must include the letters? Otherwise, we don't get position information? And also, if we don't include I, we might not find its position? 

So we must include R, I, E? Yes? Unless the secret word has duplicate? But for safety, we include them? So the next guess must include the letters R, I, E? And two other letters? Not A or S? And also, avoid placing I at position 3, E at position 5, R at position 1.

So we need a word that doesn't have R at position 1, I at position 3, E at position 5? And includes R, I, E? And two more letters? Excluding A and S? 

What are some words? 

Consider: 
""RIVET""? 
- Position 1: R -> but we tried R at position 1 and got -? So we know R is not at position 1? So if we put R at position 1 again? We will get - again? So it's redundant? We should not put R at position 1? So avoid? 

Therefore, in ""RIVET"":
Position 1: R -> avoid? Because we already know? So we get - if we put it? Not efficient? So choose a word without R at position 1? And without I at position 3? And without E at position 5? 

Alternative: ""PRICE"" -> 
Position 1: P (new)
Position 2: R (test at 2? Good? No problem? Because R is not required to be at 1? and position 2 not tested)
Position 3: I -> avoid? Because position 3 for I is already ruled out? So we put I at 3? Don't? It will give -? Which we already know? So not efficient? What if we try ""PRICE"", if we put I at 3? Then feedback if I is at position 3? It would show ✓? But we know it's not? Because from first guess it was at position 3 and got -? So it won't be ✓? So it must be - again? So we learn nothing new? So we waste? 

Then we want: 
Position 1: new letter? And not R? So for me, it's best to avoid positions for the present letters that we already know are wrong? 

So for R, we know it is not at position 1? So for next guess, put R at 2,3,4, or 5? Similarly, we know I is not at position 3? So put I at 1,2,4,5? And similarly, E not at 5? At 1,2,3,4? 

And also, we want to cover common letters? Because there are two more letters? 

For instance, let's put R at 3? That's okay? Position 3 for R: we haven't tested? 

Similarly, put I at 4? We haven't tested position 4 for I? 

Put E at 4? For example? Then we only know one position for E? 

Sample word: ""MIRTH""? But then E is missing? Oh, we must have E? So we need E? 

Another word: ""DRIVE"" - 
D, R, I, V, E
Position 1: D (new)
Position 2: R (test R at 2)
Position 3: I (but we know I not at 3? So we are wasting the position 3? We know it's not there? So we get -? And then we know R and I are present? But we don't get new information for I? 
Position 4: V (new)
Position 5: E -> wait, E at position 5? We have feedback that E is not at position 5? So if we put E at position 5? We will get - because it's present but not at 5? Which we know? So inefficient? 

Avoid E at 5.

So ""DRIVE"" is bad because of I at 3? and E at 5? both of which we know are wrong positions? 

Another word: ""ENDOW""? Then we have E at position 1? But then R and I are missing? Skip? 

We must have R, I, E? 

Then how about ""Wiper""? But W is a letter? But ""wiper"" has letters: W, I, P, E, R -> 
Position 1: W (new)
Position 2: I (test I at 2: we haven't tried I at 2 before)
Position 3: P (new) 
Position 4: E (test E at 4: haven't tried before)
Position 5: R (test R at 5: haven't tried)

And we avoid: 
- I at position 3? We put I at position 2? Which is new? 
- E not at position 5? We put E at 4? 
- R not at position 1? We put R at the end? Not at 1? 

Perfect! So ""WIPER"" is a valid word? 

Is ""WIPER"" a valid English word? Yes: a device for wiping surfaces, or a person who wipes.

We also avoid A and S.

Feedback rules: 
- In WIPER, letters: 
  Position 1: W -> new? It might be x, it might be present and what position? 
  Position 2: I -> we know I is present? What position? If I is at position 2? We get ✓? Otherwise - (if it's in but not at 2)
  Position 3: P -> new? Will be x or - or ✓?
  Position 4: E -> similarly, if at 4 ✓? Otherwise -
  Position 5: R -> similarly, if at 5 ✓? Otherwise -

And we get more information? 

Also, We cover new common letters: W, P? But yes.

Alternative: ""OLDER""? But doesn't have R, I, E? Only E? Skip? 

So I think ""WIPER"" is a good choice.

But let me check: or ""HIRED"" -> 
H, I, R, E, D
Positions:
1: H
2: I (new for I? Position 2? Avoid position 3 for I? Good)
3: R (new for R? Position 3? not tested? Good)
4: E (new? position 4? not 5? Good)
5: D

But we have R at position 3? and I at 2? E at 4? 

Is ""HIRED"" a common word? Yes? 

Compare to WIPER? Both work? 

But in WIPER, we have P? Which is a common consonant? Or HIRED has H and D? 

Both are okay? 

But we want to maximize new letter information? So in WIPER, we use W and P? In HIRED, we use H and D? 

But W is less common? H and D are more common? So perhaps HIRED is better? 

Moreover, in HIRED: we don't repeat any positions that we already know? 
I now at position 2? (against position 3 of first guess being wrong? But position 2 was A in first guess? A is absent? So position 2 is available? 
Position 3 in HIRED is R? We had I at position 3 in RAISE? But I was at 3 and we know it's not correct? But position 3 itself? We didn't test the letter R at position 3? We tested S at position 4? etc. 

Position 3 in RAISE: I -> -, meaning the letter I is present but position 3 is incorrect? But positional feedback per letter? 

So in HIRED, we avoid placing the same letter at the position it was known to be wrong? We also avoid placing any letter that we know is absent? 

So yes? 

But in HIRED, we have E at position 4? Which was not tested before? 

Similarly, R at position 3? 

Also, we have I at position 2? Which is a new position? 

So it works? 

Another possibility: ""BRIEF"" has I at position 3 so bad? 

Yes? 

For now, I think ""HIRED"" is a good choice? Or ""WIPER""? 

But we also want to consider: the secret word does not have A and S? So we are safe for today? 

Perhaps ""HIRED"" is a bit better? 

But ""WIPER"" offers more uncommon letters? So that might be good to rule out rare letters? 

Either is fine? 

I'll choose ""HIRED"" for simplicity.

But wait, in ""HIRED"", position 5: D? But we also know? We can find out.

Actually, I don't think one is clearly better? 

I think ""HIRED"" or ""PRIDE""? ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E? 
Position 1: P -> new? 
Position 2: R -> put R at 2? New? 
Position 3: I -> but we know that position 3 is wrong for I? So why? If we put I at 3? We already know it's not there? So we get -? Wasted? 

Similarly, E at position 5: but we know E is not at position 5? So we put E at 5? Get -? Wasted.

So ""PRIDE"" is bad? 

So ""HIRED"" is better? 

In fact, ""HIRED"" has: 
I at 2 -> new position? 
R at 3 -> new for R? 
E at 4 -> new position? 
And position 1: H? 
Position 5: D? 

And the word ""HIRED"" is common? 

Similarly, ""WIPER"" has: 
I at 2? 
E at 4? 
R at 5? 
Position 1: W? 
Position 3: P? 

Both avoid the bad positions? 

Another one: ""TRIED"" -> 
Position 1: T 
Position 2: R 
Position 3: I -> avoid? because I at 3 is wrong? That we know? So we put I at 3? Then redundant? So ""TRIED"" is bad? 

Indeed? 

So avoid words that put I at 3? 

Therefore, ""HIRED"" or ""WIPER""? 

But ""HIRED"" has E at position 4? And in RAISE, E was at position 5? But position 4 and 5 are different? 

So yes? 

Let's decide on ""HIRED"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with ""(-)"").  
- A is absent from the secret word (marked with ""(x)"").  
- I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked with ""(-)"").  
- S is absent from the secret word (marked with ""(x)"").  
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (marked with ""(-)"").  

### Key Inferences:
1. **Present Letters**: R, I, and E must appear in the secret word.  
2. **Absent Letters**: A and S are eliminated.  
3. **Position Constraints**:  
   - R cannot be in position 1.  
   - I cannot be in position 3.  
   - E cannot be in position 5.  

### Strategy for Second Guess:
- **Must Include**: R, I, and E to test new positions.  
- **Must Avoid**: A, S, and placing R at 1, I at 3, or E at 5.  
- **Secondary Goal**: Cover new common consonants (e.g., H, D) to gather more information.  
- **Optimal Word Choice**: ""HIRED"" fits perfectly:  
  - Puts I at position 2 (new position, not yet tested).  
  - Puts R at position 3 (new position for R, avoiding position 1).  
  - Puts E at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).  
  - Introduces new letters H (position 1) and D (position 5) to test their presence/absence.  

""HIRED"" is a common English word and efficiently leverages all known constraints.

<guess>HIRED</guess>",HIRED,"We are given the feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": 
R -> (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
A -> (x) meaning A is not in the word.
I -> (-) meaning I is in the word but in the wrong position.
S -> (x) meaning S is not in the word.
E -> (-) meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, from this feedback:
- The secret word contains the letters: R, I, E (but not in the positions they were in RAISE)
- The secret word does NOT contain: A, S.

Also note: Since R is in the word but not in position 1 (because we got - for R in first position), similarly I is not in position 3, E is not in position 5.

Now, the positions in RAISE:
Position 1: R -> wrong position (but present)
Position 2: A -> absent
Position 3: I -> wrong position (but present)
Position 4: S -> absent
Position 5: E -> wrong position (but present)

So we know:
- R must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5? Wait, no: positions are fixed. The R is in the secret word but not at position 1. Similarly, I is not at position 3, and E is not at position 5.

Moreover, since A and S are absent, we can rule out any word containing A or S.

Now, for the next guess:
- We want to use the known letters: R, I, E and avoid A and S.
- We also want to try placing R, I, E in different positions to test their correct positions.

Also, we need to choose a word that is 5 letters and doesn't have A or S.

Known present letters: R, I, E.

We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test positions.

Let's think of common words that contain R, I, E and without the letters A or S.

Possible letters? We can try to cover more common consonants.

For example, we know:
- Position 2 of the secret word is not A (and A is absent so any letter is okay except A and S, but we must include R, I, E).

Wait, the secret word doesn't have A or S, so we can only use letters from the remaining 24 letters.

We have three known letters: R, I, E. So the word must have R, I, E and two other letters? Not necessarily, because the word might have duplicate letters? But note: in the feedback, if there were duplicates, it might show accordingly? However, in RAISE we don't have duplicates.

But the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates explicitly? Actually, the rules say that if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets -, regardless of duplicates? But if the secret word has two of a letter and the guess has one, then the one that matches position gets ✓ and the other might get - or x? Actually, the standard Wordle rule: each letter in the guess is matched individually. But for duplicate letters, the feedback can be tricky.

However, in our first guess, we didn't get any duplicate feedback issue.

But note: we have three known letters: R, I, E. The secret word could have duplicates? But for now, assuming no duplicates in the secret word? We don't know.

But we must form a word with R, I, E and two other letters, without A and S.

Also, we must avoid placing R at position 1, I at position 3, E at position 5.

So let's try to form words:

- R cannot be at position 1? But in the next guess we can put R elsewhere? Actually, we must put R somewhere else because it cannot be at position 1 (since in RAISE R was at 1 and got -).

Similarly, I cannot be at position 3? And E cannot be at position 5.

Now, position 1: cannot be R? Actually, the feedback says R is present but not at position 1, so in the secret word, R is at position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, I is not at position 3: so it can be at 1,2,4,5? But wait, we haven't tested position 1 for I? Actually, we have no information on position 1 except that it's not R? It could be I? Yes.

Similarly, E is not at position 5: so it can be at 1,2,3,4.

But note: we also know that the secret word has the letters R, I, E and two others (or possibly duplicates? but we don't know).

We want to try a word that uses these three letters in different positions and adds two new letters.

Let me think of words that contain R, I, E, and exclude A and S.

Common possibilities: words like ""RIVET"", ""TRIED"", ""PRICE"", ""BRINE"", ""CRIER"", ""DRIVE"", etc.

But we need to choose one that places R, I, E in positions we haven't ruled out.

Consider the constraints:

- Position 1: cannot be R (from first feedback). So if I put I at position 1, that's okay? Yes.

Similarly, we can test E at position 1? That's allowed.

Let's list:

Option: Use ""TRIED"":
- T at 1: new letter
- R at 2: but in RAISE, we had R at 1 which was wrong, but R at 2? We don't know.
It might be okay to put R at 2? Because in the next position we can get information.

But note: we also haven't tested any of the other positions? So why not.

But let me check the word ""TRIED"":
Position 1: T (new)
Position 2: R (we know R is in the word, but we haven't checked position 2 before? We only checked position 1 for R and found it was wrong. So putting R at position 2 is a possibility? Yes.

Similarly, I at position 3: but wait, in the first guess I was at position 3 and got - meaning it's not at 3. So if we put I at position 3 again, it will still be wrong? Unless we haven't changed the position? Actually, we already know it's not at position 3? So putting it again at 3 might be inefficient? But we get feedback: if it's at 3 we get ✓? But we already know it's not at 3? Yes, first feedback said I at position 3 was wrong. So we shouldn't put I at position 3? We should put I at a different position.

Similarly, E was at position 5 and wrong, so avoid putting E at 5.

In ""TRIED"": 
Position 3: I -> but we already know I is not at position 3? So if we put it there, we expect it to show - again? Yes, because it's still in the word but not at 3? But if we put I at position 3, we get - meaning it's present but wrong position? But we already know that. It doesn't give us new information? And we lose the chance to test I at another position.

Therefore, we want to put I at a position we don't know: i.e., positions 1,2,4,5? But position 5 we have to avoid E? Actually, we can put I anywhere except 3.

But in ""TRIED"", I is at position 3, which we know is wrong. So that guess wouldn't help us test for position 3? We already know it's not at 3, so it's redundant.

Moreover, E is at position 4: which is new? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5? So testing E at position 4 is okay? Yes.

But we also have E at 4? But the feedback was E not at position 5? So position 4 could be correct for E? Yes.

Alternatively, consider the word ""PRICE"":
Position 1: P (new)
Position 2: R (not position 1, so position 2 we don't know)
Position 3: I (but we know I is not at position 3? So we expect - for I? We already know that? So same issue? Not efficient.)

So we need a word that:
- Has R, I, E (since we must include them? Actually, we don't have to? But we have only three known letters? There are two other letters we don't know? We must use R, I, E because we know they are present? Actually, no: the secret word has R, I, E? So we must have them? Yes? Because they are present? So the next guess must include them? Not necessarily? Why?

Actually, technically, we don't have to include all the known letters? But it's efficient to do so? Because we can test them in new positions.

Moreover, if we don't include a known letter, we don't get information about its position? So we should include them.

So: the next guess should include R, I, E and two new letters? Also, avoid A and S? So yes.

And we need to avoid the positions that we already ruled out: 
- R: not at position 1? And we don't know about positions 2,3,4,5? Actually, positions 1: R cannot be? But we can put R at 2?
We can put R at any position except 1? Since position 1 was tested and wrong? Similarly, I cannot be at 3? So we can put I at 1,2,4,5? And E cannot be at 5? So E at positions 1,2,3,4.

So for our next guess, we want to assign R to a position other than 1, I to a position other than 3, and E to a position other than 5.

Moreover, we use two new letters? And we get feedback on them? So we choose common consonants? And vowel? But we have I and E? So consonants? 

Possible words:

Let me try E at position 1? And R at position 2? Or something else.

For example:
- Position 1: E? (E can be at 1? Yes)
- Position 2: I? (I can be at 2? Yes) but wait, then what about R? We need a place for R.

Example: ""EIRIE""? No, it has duplicate E? Also, EIRIE is five letters? But it's obscure? Not common? We want a valid word.

Another idea: ""BRIEF""?
- B (new) at 1
- R at 2
- I at 3 -> wait, position 3: we know I cannot be at 3? So same issue? So if we put I at 3, we get -? Which we already know? So redundant? We don't get new position? Because when we put I at 3, it's present but wrong? But we know it's not at 3? So we don't get whether it's at 3? We know it's not? So we are wasting a position? So don't put I at 3.

Similarly, avoid putting R at 1? And E at 5? 

Now, BRIEF: 
Position 3: I -> we avoid because we already know I is wrong at position 3? So no.

Alternative: ""CRIER"" -> 
Position 1: C (new)
Position 2: R (test R at 2? Then if R is at 2, we get ✓? But we don't know? Position 2 is new? So okay? But we also have I at position 3 -> we know I is not at 3? So again, I at 3 will give -? which we already know? And E at 4? That's okay? Then R at the end? but there are two R's? 

In ""CRIER"": 
Letters: C, R, I, E, R -> but the secret word? It might have duplicate R? But we don't know? So we have R at position 2 and 5? If we put R at position 2? And R at position 5? But we already know R is in the word? This might complicate.

But also, I at 3: we know it's wrong? So we don't get new information? 

Perhaps a better word: ""DOZER""? But contains S? Wait, not? DOZER: D,O,Z,E,R -> E at position 4? But where is I? Not present? We must have I? Because it's a known letter? Yes? The secret word has I? So we must include I? Otherwise, I will be absent? But we know it's present? So the next guess must include the letters? Otherwise, we don't get position information? And also, if we don't include I, we might not find its position? 

So we must include R, I, E? Yes? Unless the secret word has duplicate? But for safety, we include them? So the next guess must include the letters R, I, E? And two other letters? Not A or S? And also, avoid placing I at position 3, E at position 5, R at position 1.

So we need a word that doesn't have R at position 1, I at position 3, E at position 5? And includes R, I, E? And two more letters? Excluding A and S? 

What are some words? 

Consider: 
""RIVET""? 
- Position 1: R -> but we tried R at position 1 and got -? So we know R is not at position 1? So if we put R at position 1 again? We will get - again? So it's redundant? We should not put R at position 1? So avoid? 

Therefore, in ""RIVET"":
Position 1: R -> avoid? Because we already know? So we get - if we put it? Not efficient? So choose a word without R at position 1? And without I at position 3? And without E at position 5? 

Alternative: ""PRICE"" -> 
Position 1: P (new)
Position 2: R (test at 2? Good? No problem? Because R is not required to be at 1? and position 2 not tested)
Position 3: I -> avoid? Because position 3 for I is already ruled out? So we put I at 3? Don't? It will give -? Which we already know? So not efficient? What if we try ""PRICE"", if we put I at 3? Then feedback if I is at position 3? It would show ✓? But we know it's not? Because from first guess it was at position 3 and got -? So it won't be ✓? So it must be - again? So we learn nothing new? So we waste? 

Then we want: 
Position 1: new letter? And not R? So for me, it's best to avoid positions for the present letters that we already know are wrong? 

So for R, we know it is not at position 1? So for next guess, put R at 2,3,4, or 5? Similarly, we know I is not at position 3? So put I at 1,2,4,5? And similarly, E not at 5? At 1,2,3,4? 

And also, we want to cover common letters? Because there are two more letters? 

For instance, let's put R at 3? That's okay? Position 3 for R: we haven't tested? 

Similarly, put I at 4? We haven't tested position 4 for I? 

Put E at 4? For example? Then we only know one position for E? 

Sample word: ""MIRTH""? But then E is missing? Oh, we must have E? So we need E? 

Another word: ""DRIVE"" - 
D, R, I, V, E
Position 1: D (new)
Position 2: R (test R at 2)
Position 3: I (but we know I not at 3? So we are wasting the position 3? We know it's not there? So we get -? And then we know R and I are present? But we don't get new information for I? 
Position 4: V (new)
Position 5: E -> wait, E at position 5? We have feedback that E is not at position 5? So if we put E at position 5? We will get - because it's present but not at 5? Which we know? So inefficient? 

Avoid E at 5.

So ""DRIVE"" is bad because of I at 3? and E at 5? both of which we know are wrong positions? 

Another word: ""ENDOW""? Then we have E at position 1? But then R and I are missing? Skip? 

We must have R, I, E? 

Then how about ""Wiper""? But W is a letter? But ""wiper"" has letters: W, I, P, E, R -> 
Position 1: W (new)
Position 2: I (test I at 2: we haven't tried I at 2 before)
Position 3: P (new) 
Position 4: E (test E at 4: haven't tried before)
Position 5: R (test R at 5: haven't tried)

And we avoid: 
- I at position 3? We put I at position 2? Which is new? 
- E not at position 5? We put E at 4? 
- R not at position 1? We put R at the end? Not at 1? 

Perfect! So ""WIPER"" is a valid word? 

Is ""WIPER"" a valid English word? Yes: a device for wiping surfaces, or a person who wipes.

We also avoid A and S.

Feedback rules: 
- In WIPER, letters: 
  Position 1: W -> new? It might be x, it might be present and what position? 
  Position 2: I -> we know I is present? What position? If I is at position 2? We get ✓? Otherwise - (if it's in but not at 2)
  Position 3: P -> new? Will be x or - or ✓?
  Position 4: E -> similarly, if at 4 ✓? Otherwise -
  Position 5: R -> similarly, if at 5 ✓? Otherwise -

And we get more information? 

Also, We cover new common letters: W, P? But yes.

Alternative: ""OLDER""? But doesn't have R, I, E? Only E? Skip? 

So I think ""WIPER"" is a good choice.

But let me check: or ""HIRED"" -> 
H, I, R, E, D
Positions:
1: H
2: I (new for I? Position 2? Avoid position 3 for I? Good)
3: R (new for R? Position 3? not tested? Good)
4: E (new? position 4? not 5? Good)
5: D

But we have R at position 3? and I at 2? E at 4? 

Is ""HIRED"" a common word? Yes? 

Compare to WIPER? Both work? 

But in WIPER, we have P? Which is a common consonant? Or HIRED has H and D? 

Both are okay? 

But we want to maximize new letter information? So in WIPER, we use W and P? In HIRED, we use H and D? 

But W is less common? H and D are more common? So perhaps HIRED is better? 

Moreover, in HIRED: we don't repeat any positions that we already know? 
I now at position 2? (against position 3 of first guess being wrong? But position 2 was A in first guess? A is absent? So position 2 is available? 
Position 3 in HIRED is R? We had I at position 3 in RAISE? But I was at 3 and we know it's not correct? But position 3 itself? We didn't test the letter R at position 3? We tested S at position 4? etc. 

Position 3 in RAISE: I -> -, meaning the letter I is present but position 3 is incorrect? But positional feedback per letter? 

So in HIRED, we avoid placing the same letter at the position it was known to be wrong? We also avoid placing any letter that we know is absent? 

So yes? 

But in HIRED, we have E at position 4? Which was not tested before? 

Similarly, R at position 3? 

Also, we have I at position 2? Which is a new position? 

So it works? 

Another possibility: ""BRIEF"" has I at position 3 so bad? 

Yes? 

For now, I think ""HIRED"" is a good choice? Or ""WIPER""? 

But we also want to consider: the secret word does not have A and S? So we are safe for today? 

Perhaps ""HIRED"" is a bit better? 

But ""WIPER"" offers more uncommon letters? So that might be good to rule out rare letters? 

Either is fine? 

I'll choose ""HIRED"" for simplicity.

But wait, in ""HIRED"", position 5: D? But we also know? We can find out.

Actually, I don't think one is clearly better? 

I think ""HIRED"" or ""PRIDE""? ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E? 
Position 1: P -> new? 
Position 2: R -> put R at 2? New? 
Position 3: I -> but we know that position 3 is wrong for I? So why? If we put I at 3? We already know it's not there? So we get -? Wasted? 

Similarly, E at position 5: but we know E is not at position 5? So we put E at 5? Get -? Wasted.

So ""PRIDE"" is bad? 

So ""HIRED"" is better? 

In fact, ""HIRED"" has: 
I at 2 -> new position? 
R at 3 -> new for R? 
E at 4 -> new position? 
And position 1: H? 
Position 5: D? 

And the word ""HIRED"" is common? 

Similarly, ""WIPER"" has: 
I at 2? 
E at 4? 
R at 5? 
Position 1: W? 
Position 3: P? 

Both avoid the bad positions? 

Another one: ""TRIED"" -> 
Position 1: T 
Position 2: R 
Position 3: I -> avoid? because I at 3 is wrong? That we know? So we put I at 3? Then redundant? So ""TRIED"" is bad? 

Indeed? 

So avoid words that put I at 3? 

Therefore, ""HIRED"" or ""WIPER""? 

But ""HIRED"" has E at position 4? And in RAISE, E was at position 5? But position 4 and 5 are different? 

So yes? 

Let's decide on ""HIRED"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with ""(-)"").  
- A is absent from the secret word (marked with ""(x)"").  
- I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked with ""(-)"").  
- S is absent from the secret word (marked with ""(x)"").  
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (marked with ""(-)"").  

### Key Inferences:
1. **Present Letters**: R, I, and E must appear in the secret word.  
2. **Absent Letters**: A and S are eliminated.  
3. **Position Constraints**:  
   - R cannot be in position 1.  
   - I cannot be in position 3.  
   - E cannot be in position 5.  

### Strategy for Second Guess:
- **Must Include**: R, I, and E to test new positions.  
- **Must Avoid**: A, S, and placing R at 1, I at 3, or E at 5.  
- **Secondary Goal**: Cover new common consonants (e.g., H, D) to gather more information.  
- **Optimal Word Choice**: ""HIRED"" fits perfectly:  
  - Puts I at position 2 (new position, not yet tested).  
  - Puts R at position 3 (new position for R, avoiding position 1).  
  - Puts E at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).  
  - Introduces new letters H (position 1) and D (position 5) to test their presence/absence.  

""HIRED"" is a common English word and efficiently leverages all known constraints.",Guess 2: HIRED -> FEEDBACK: H(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(-),FAIL

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. For the first guess, we want to choose a word that can give us as much information as possible.
 Typically, a good starting word has:
   - Common letters (vowels and frequent consonants)
   - No repeating letters

 Common starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, AUDIO, RAISE, etc.

 Let's choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. ""RAISE"" is a popular choice because it has 'R', 'A', 'I', 'S', 'E' — all common letters.

 But note: the feedback mechanism does not reveal duplicate letters explicitly? And the secret word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't specify, but commonly words can have duplicates.

 However, for maximum information, we avoid duplicates in the first guess.

 My first guess: RAISE<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize information. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"" are often effective as they contain frequently used letters. 

I'll select ""RAISE"" as it:
- Includes three vowels (A, I, E) 
- Uses common consonants (R, S)
- Has no repeated letters
- Covers frequent letters in English 5-letter words

This choice should provide useful feedback about:
- Vowel presence/position
- Key consonants (R/S)
- Positioning clues for next guesses
</thinking>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the feedback for the first guess ""RAISE"": 
R -> (-) meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position.
A -> (x) meaning A is not in the word.
I -> (-) meaning I is in the word but in the wrong position.
S -> (x) meaning S is not in the word.
E -> (-) meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, from this feedback:
- The secret word contains the letters: R, I, E (but not in the positions they were in RAISE)
- The secret word does NOT contain: A, S.

Also note: Since R is in the word but not in position 1 (because we got - for R in first position), similarly I is not in position 3, E is not in position 5.

Now, the positions in RAISE:
Position 1: R -> wrong position (but present)
Position 2: A -> absent
Position 3: I -> wrong position (but present)
Position 4: S -> absent
Position 5: E -> wrong position (but present)

So we know:
- R must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5? Wait, no: positions are fixed. The R is in the secret word but not at position 1. Similarly, I is not at position 3, and E is not at position 5.

Moreover, since A and S are absent, we can rule out any word containing A or S.

Now, for the next guess:
- We want to use the known letters: R, I, E and avoid A and S.
- We also want to try placing R, I, E in different positions to test their correct positions.

Also, we need to choose a word that is 5 letters and doesn't have A or S.

Known present letters: R, I, E.

We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test positions.

Let's think of common words that contain R, I, E and without the letters A or S.

Possible letters? We can try to cover more common consonants.

For example, we know:
- Position 2 of the secret word is not A (and A is absent so any letter is okay except A and S, but we must include R, I, E).

Wait, the secret word doesn't have A or S, so we can only use letters from the remaining 24 letters.

We have three known letters: R, I, E. So the word must have R, I, E and two other letters? Not necessarily, because the word might have duplicate letters? But note: in the feedback, if there were duplicates, it might show accordingly? However, in RAISE we don't have duplicates.

But the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates explicitly? Actually, the rules say that if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets -, regardless of duplicates? But if the secret word has two of a letter and the guess has one, then the one that matches position gets ✓ and the other might get - or x? Actually, the standard Wordle rule: each letter in the guess is matched individually. But for duplicate letters, the feedback can be tricky.

However, in our first guess, we didn't get any duplicate feedback issue.

But note: we have three known letters: R, I, E. The secret word could have duplicates? But for now, assuming no duplicates in the secret word? We don't know.

But we must form a word with R, I, E and two other letters, without A and S.

Also, we must avoid placing R at position 1, I at position 3, E at position 5.

So let's try to form words:

- R cannot be at position 1? But in the next guess we can put R elsewhere? Actually, we must put R somewhere else because it cannot be at position 1 (since in RAISE R was at 1 and got -).

Similarly, I cannot be at position 3? And E cannot be at position 5.

Now, position 1: cannot be R? Actually, the feedback says R is present but not at position 1, so in the secret word, R is at position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, I is not at position 3: so it can be at 1,2,4,5? But wait, we haven't tested position 1 for I? Actually, we have no information on position 1 except that it's not R? It could be I? Yes.

Similarly, E is not at position 5: so it can be at 1,2,3,4.

But note: we also know that the secret word has the letters R, I, E and two others (or possibly duplicates? but we don't know).

We want to try a word that uses these three letters in different positions and adds two new letters.

Let me think of words that contain R, I, E, and exclude A and S.

Common possibilities: words like ""RIVET"", ""TRIED"", ""PRICE"", ""BRINE"", ""CRIER"", ""DRIVE"", etc.

But we need to choose one that places R, I, E in positions we haven't ruled out.

Consider the constraints:

- Position 1: cannot be R (from first feedback). So if I put I at position 1, that's okay? Yes.

Similarly, we can test E at position 1? That's allowed.

Let's list:

Option: Use ""TRIED"":
- T at 1: new letter
- R at 2: but in RAISE, we had R at 1 which was wrong, but R at 2? We don't know.
It might be okay to put R at 2? Because in the next position we can get information.

But note: we also haven't tested any of the other positions? So why not.

But let me check the word ""TRIED"":
Position 1: T (new)
Position 2: R (we know R is in the word, but we haven't checked position 2 before? We only checked position 1 for R and found it was wrong. So putting R at position 2 is a possibility? Yes.

Similarly, I at position 3: but wait, in the first guess I was at position 3 and got - meaning it's not at 3. So if we put I at position 3 again, it will still be wrong? Unless we haven't changed the position? Actually, we already know it's not at position 3? So putting it again at 3 might be inefficient? But we get feedback: if it's at 3 we get ✓? But we already know it's not at 3? Yes, first feedback said I at position 3 was wrong. So we shouldn't put I at position 3? We should put I at a different position.

Similarly, E was at position 5 and wrong, so avoid putting E at 5.

In ""TRIED"": 
Position 3: I -> but we already know I is not at position 3? So if we put it there, we expect it to show - again? Yes, because it's still in the word but not at 3? But if we put I at position 3, we get - meaning it's present but wrong position? But we already know that. It doesn't give us new information? And we lose the chance to test I at another position.

Therefore, we want to put I at a position we don't know: i.e., positions 1,2,4,5? But position 5 we have to avoid E? Actually, we can put I anywhere except 3.

But in ""TRIED"", I is at position 3, which we know is wrong. So that guess wouldn't help us test for position 3? We already know it's not at 3, so it's redundant.

Moreover, E is at position 4: which is new? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5? So testing E at position 4 is okay? Yes.

But we also have E at 4? But the feedback was E not at position 5? So position 4 could be correct for E? Yes.

Alternatively, consider the word ""PRICE"":
Position 1: P (new)
Position 2: R (not position 1, so position 2 we don't know)
Position 3: I (but we know I is not at position 3? So we expect - for I? We already know that? So same issue? Not efficient.)

So we need a word that:
- Has R, I, E (since we must include them? Actually, we don't have to? But we have only three known letters? There are two other letters we don't know? We must use R, I, E because we know they are present? Actually, no: the secret word has R, I, E? So we must have them? Yes? Because they are present? So the next guess must include them? Not necessarily? Why?

Actually, technically, we don't have to include all the known letters? But it's efficient to do so? Because we can test them in new positions.

Moreover, if we don't include a known letter, we don't get information about its position? So we should include them.

So: the next guess should include R, I, E and two new letters? Also, avoid A and S? So yes.

And we need to avoid the positions that we already ruled out: 
- R: not at position 1? And we don't know about positions 2,3,4,5? Actually, positions 1: R cannot be? But we can put R at 2?
We can put R at any position except 1? Since position 1 was tested and wrong? Similarly, I cannot be at 3? So we can put I at 1,2,4,5? And E cannot be at 5? So E at positions 1,2,3,4.

So for our next guess, we want to assign R to a position other than 1, I to a position other than 3, and E to a position other than 5.

Moreover, we use two new letters? And we get feedback on them? So we choose common consonants? And vowel? But we have I and E? So consonants? 

Possible words:

Let me try E at position 1? And R at position 2? Or something else.

For example:
- Position 1: E? (E can be at 1? Yes)
- Position 2: I? (I can be at 2? Yes) but wait, then what about R? We need a place for R.

Example: ""EIRIE""? No, it has duplicate E? Also, EIRIE is five letters? But it's obscure? Not common? We want a valid word.

Another idea: ""BRIEF""?
- B (new) at 1
- R at 2
- I at 3 -> wait, position 3: we know I cannot be at 3? So same issue? So if we put I at 3, we get -? Which we already know? So redundant? We don't get new position? Because when we put I at 3, it's present but wrong? But we know it's not at 3? So we don't get whether it's at 3? We know it's not? So we are wasting a position? So don't put I at 3.

Similarly, avoid putting R at 1? And E at 5? 

Now, BRIEF: 
Position 3: I -> we avoid because we already know I is wrong at position 3? So no.

Alternative: ""CRIER"" -> 
Position 1: C (new)
Position 2: R (test R at 2? Then if R is at 2, we get ✓? But we don't know? Position 2 is new? So okay? But we also have I at position 3 -> we know I is not at 3? So again, I at 3 will give -? which we already know? And E at 4? That's okay? Then R at the end? but there are two R's? 

In ""CRIER"": 
Letters: C, R, I, E, R -> but the secret word? It might have duplicate R? But we don't know? So we have R at position 2 and 5? If we put R at position 2? And R at position 5? But we already know R is in the word? This might complicate.

But also, I at 3: we know it's wrong? So we don't get new information? 

Perhaps a better word: ""DOZER""? But contains S? Wait, not? DOZER: D,O,Z,E,R -> E at position 4? But where is I? Not present? We must have I? Because it's a known letter? Yes? The secret word has I? So we must include I? Otherwise, I will be absent? But we know it's present? So the next guess must include the letters? Otherwise, we don't get position information? And also, if we don't include I, we might not find its position? 

So we must include R, I, E? Yes? Unless the secret word has duplicate? But for safety, we include them? So the next guess must include the letters R, I, E? And two other letters? Not A or S? And also, avoid placing I at position 3, E at position 5, R at position 1.

So we need a word that doesn't have R at position 1, I at position 3, E at position 5? And includes R, I, E? And two more letters? Excluding A and S? 

What are some words? 

Consider: 
""RIVET""? 
- Position 1: R -> but we tried R at position 1 and got -? So we know R is not at position 1? So if we put R at position 1 again? We will get - again? So it's redundant? We should not put R at position 1? So avoid? 

Therefore, in ""RIVET"":
Position 1: R -> avoid? Because we already know? So we get - if we put it? Not efficient? So choose a word without R at position 1? And without I at position 3? And without E at position 5? 

Alternative: ""PRICE"" -> 
Position 1: P (new)
Position 2: R (test at 2? Good? No problem? Because R is not required to be at 1? and position 2 not tested)
Position 3: I -> avoid? Because position 3 for I is already ruled out? So we put I at 3? Don't? It will give -? Which we already know? So not efficient? What if we try ""PRICE"", if we put I at 3? Then feedback if I is at position 3? It would show ✓? But we know it's not? Because from first guess it was at position 3 and got -? So it won't be ✓? So it must be - again? So we learn nothing new? So we waste? 

Then we want: 
Position 1: new letter? And not R? So for me, it's best to avoid positions for the present letters that we already know are wrong? 

So for R, we know it is not at position 1? So for next guess, put R at 2,3,4, or 5? Similarly, we know I is not at position 3? So put I at 1,2,4,5? And similarly, E not at 5? At 1,2,3,4? 

And also, we want to cover common letters? Because there are two more letters? 

For instance, let's put R at 3? That's okay? Position 3 for R: we haven't tested? 

Similarly, put I at 4? We haven't tested position 4 for I? 

Put E at 4? For example? Then we only know one position for E? 

Sample word: ""MIRTH""? But then E is missing? Oh, we must have E? So we need E? 

Another word: ""DRIVE"" - 
D, R, I, V, E
Position 1: D (new)
Position 2: R (test R at 2)
Position 3: I (but we know I not at 3? So we are wasting the position 3? We know it's not there? So we get -? And then we know R and I are present? But we don't get new information for I? 
Position 4: V (new)
Position 5: E -> wait, E at position 5? We have feedback that E is not at position 5? So if we put E at position 5? We will get - because it's present but not at 5? Which we know? So inefficient? 

Avoid E at 5.

So ""DRIVE"" is bad because of I at 3? and E at 5? both of which we know are wrong positions? 

Another word: ""ENDOW""? Then we have E at position 1? But then R and I are missing? Skip? 

We must have R, I, E? 

Then how about ""Wiper""? But W is a letter? But ""wiper"" has letters: W, I, P, E, R -> 
Position 1: W (new)
Position 2: I (test I at 2: we haven't tried I at 2 before)
Position 3: P (new) 
Position 4: E (test E at 4: haven't tried before)
Position 5: R (test R at 5: haven't tried)

And we avoid: 
- I at position 3? We put I at position 2? Which is new? 
- E not at position 5? We put E at 4? 
- R not at position 1? We put R at the end? Not at 1? 

Perfect! So ""WIPER"" is a valid word? 

Is ""WIPER"" a valid English word? Yes: a device for wiping surfaces, or a person who wipes.

We also avoid A and S.

Feedback rules: 
- In WIPER, letters: 
  Position 1: W -> new? It might be x, it might be present and what position? 
  Position 2: I -> we know I is present? What position? If I is at position 2? We get ✓? Otherwise - (if it's in but not at 2)
  Position 3: P -> new? Will be x or - or ✓?
  Position 4: E -> similarly, if at 4 ✓? Otherwise -
  Position 5: R -> similarly, if at 5 ✓? Otherwise -

And we get more information? 

Also, We cover new common letters: W, P? But yes.

Alternative: ""OLDER""? But doesn't have R, I, E? Only E? Skip? 

So I think ""WIPER"" is a good choice.

But let me check: or ""HIRED"" -> 
H, I, R, E, D
Positions:
1: H
2: I (new for I? Position 2? Avoid position 3 for I? Good)
3: R (new for R? Position 3? not tested? Good)
4: E (new? position 4? not 5? Good)
5: D

But we have R at position 3? and I at 2? E at 4? 

Is ""HIRED"" a common word? Yes? 

Compare to WIPER? Both work? 

But in WIPER, we have P? Which is a common consonant? Or HIRED has H and D? 

Both are okay? 

But we want to maximize new letter information? So in WIPER, we use W and P? In HIRED, we use H and D? 

But W is less common? H and D are more common? So perhaps HIRED is better? 

Moreover, in HIRED: we don't repeat any positions that we already know? 
I now at position 2? (against position 3 of first guess being wrong? But position 2 was A in first guess? A is absent? So position 2 is available? 
Position 3 in HIRED is R? We had I at position 3 in RAISE? But I was at 3 and we know it's not correct? But position 3 itself? We didn't test the letter R at position 3? We tested S at position 4? etc. 

Position 3 in RAISE: I -> -, meaning the letter I is present but position 3 is incorrect? But positional feedback per letter? 

So in HIRED, we avoid placing the same letter at the position it was known to be wrong? We also avoid placing any letter that we know is absent? 

So yes? 

But in HIRED, we have E at position 4? Which was not tested before? 

Similarly, R at position 3? 

Also, we have I at position 2? Which is a new position? 

So it works? 

Another possibility: ""BRIEF"" has I at position 3 so bad? 

Yes? 

For now, I think ""HIRED"" is a good choice? Or ""WIPER""? 

But we also want to consider: the secret word does not have A and S? So we are safe for today? 

Perhaps ""HIRED"" is a bit better? 

But ""WIPER"" offers more uncommon letters? So that might be good to rule out rare letters? 

Either is fine? 

I'll choose ""HIRED"" for simplicity.

But wait, in ""HIRED"", position 5: D? But we also know? We can find out.

Actually, I don't think one is clearly better? 

I think ""HIRED"" or ""PRIDE""? ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E? 
Position 1: P -> new? 
Position 2: R -> put R at 2? New? 
Position 3: I -> but we know that position 3 is wrong for I? So why? If we put I at 3? We already know it's not there? So we get -? Wasted? 

Similarly, E at position 5: but we know E is not at position 5? So we put E at 5? Get -? Wasted.

So ""PRIDE"" is bad? 

So ""HIRED"" is better? 

In fact, ""HIRED"" has: 
I at 2 -> new position? 
R at 3 -> new for R? 
E at 4 -> new position? 
And position 1: H? 
Position 5: D? 

And the word ""HIRED"" is common? 

Similarly, ""WIPER"" has: 
I at 2? 
E at 4? 
R at 5? 
Position 1: W? 
Position 3: P? 

Both avoid the bad positions? 

Another one: ""TRIED"" -> 
Position 1: T 
Position 2: R 
Position 3: I -> avoid? because I at 3 is wrong? That we know? So we put I at 3? Then redundant? So ""TRIED"" is bad? 

Indeed? 

So avoid words that put I at 3? 

Therefore, ""HIRED"" or ""WIPER""? 

But ""HIRED"" has E at position 4? And in RAISE, E was at position 5? But position 4 and 5 are different? 

So yes? 

Let's decide on ""HIRED"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with ""(-)"").  
- A is absent from the secret word (marked with ""(x)"").  
- I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked with ""(-)"").  
- S is absent from the secret word (marked with ""(x)"").  
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (marked with ""(-)"").  

### Key Inferences:
1. **Present Letters**: R, I, and E must appear in the secret word.  
2. **Absent Letters**: A and S are eliminated.  
3. **Position Constraints**:  
   - R cannot be in position 1.  
   - I cannot be in position 3.  
   - E cannot be in position 5.  

### Strategy for Second Guess:
- **Must Include**: R, I, and E to test new positions.  
- **Must Avoid**: A, S, and placing R at 1, I at 3, or E at 5.  
- **Secondary Goal**: Cover new common consonants (e.g., H, D) to gather more information.  
- **Optimal Word Choice**: ""HIRED"" fits perfectly:  
  - Puts I at position 2 (new position, not yet tested).  
  - Puts R at position 3 (new position for R, avoiding position 1).  
  - Puts E at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).  
  - Introduces new letters H (position 1) and D (position 5) to test their presence/absence.  

""HIRED"" is a common English word and efficiently leverages all known constraints.

We can try to cover more common consonants.\n\nFor example, we know:\n- Position 2 of the secret word is not A (and A is absent so any letter is okay except A and S, but we must include R, I, E).\n\nWait, the secret word doesn\'t have A or S, so we can only use letters from the remaining 24 letters.\n\nWe have three known letters: R, I, E.

Actually, the rules say that if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it gets -, regardless of duplicates? But if the secret word has two of a letter and the guess has one, then the one that matches position gets ✓ and the other might get - or x? Actually, the standard Wordle rule: each letter in the guess is matched individually. But for duplicate letters, the feedback can be tricky.\n\nHowever, in our first guess, we didn\'t get any duplicate feedback issue.\n\nBut note: we have three known letters: R, I, E. The secret word could have duplicates? But for now, assuming no duplicates in the secret word?

And E cannot be at position 5.\n\nNow, position 1: cannot be R? Actually, the feedback says R is present but not at position 1, so in the secret word, R is at position 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, I is not at position 3: so it can be at 1,2,4,5? But wait, we haven\'t tested position 1 for I? Actually, we have no information on position 1 except that it\'s not R? It could be I? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, E is not at position 5: so it can be at 1,2,3,4.\n\nBut note: we also know that the secret word has the letters R, I, E and two others (or possibly duplicates? but we don\'t know).\n\nWe want to try a word that uses these three letters in different positions and adds two new letters.\n\nLet me think of words that contain R, I, E, and exclude A and S.\n\nCommon possibilities: words like ""RIVET"", ""TRIED"", ""PRICE"", ""BRINE"", ""CRIER"", ""DRIVE"", etc.\n\nBut we need to choose one that places R, I, E in positions we haven\'t ruled out.\n\nConsider the constraints:\n\n- Position 1: cannot be R (from first feedback).

Because in the next position we can get information.\n\nBut note: we also haven\'t tested any of the other positions? So why not.\n\nBut let me check the word ""TRIED"":\nPosition 1: T (new)\nPosition 2: R (we know R is in the word, but we haven\'t checked position 2 before? We only checked position 1 for R and found it was wrong. So putting R at position 2 is a possibility? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, I at position 3: but wait, in the first guess I was at position 3 and got - meaning it\'s not at 3. So if we put I at position 3 again, it will still be wrong? Unless we haven\'t changed the position? Actually, we already know it\'s not at position 3? So putting it again at 3 might be inefficient? But we get feedback: if it\'s at 3 we get ✓? But we already know it\'s not at 3? Yes, first feedback said I at position 3 was wrong. So we shouldn\'t put I at position 3? We should put I at a different position.\n\nSimilarly, E was at position 5 and wrong, so avoid putting E at 5.\n\nIn ""TRIED"": \nPosition 3: I -> but we already know I is not at position 3? So if we put it there, we expect it to show - again? Yes, because it\'s still in the word but not at 3? But if we put I at position 3, we get - meaning it\'s present but wrong position? But we already know that. It doesn\'t give us new information? And we lose the chance to test I at another position.\n\nTherefore, we want to put I at a position we don\'t know: i.e., positions 1,2,4,5? But position 5 we have to avoid E? Actually, we can put I anywhere except 3.\n\nBut in ""TRIED"", I is at position 3, which we know is wrong. So that guess wouldn\'t help us test for position 3? We already know it\'s not at 3, so it\'s redundant.\n\nMoreover, E is at position 4: which is new? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5? So testing E at position 4 is okay? Yes.\n\nBut we also have E at 4? But the feedback was E not at position 5? So position 4 could be correct for E? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, consider the word ""PRICE"":\nPosition 1: P (new)\nPosition 2: R (not position 1, so position 2 we don\'t know)\nPosition 3: I (but we know I is not at position 3? So we expect - for I? We already know that? So same issue? Not efficient.)\n\nSo we need a word that:\n- Has R, I, E (since we must include them? Actually, we don\'t have to? But we have only three known letters? There are two other letters we don\'t know? We must use R, I, E because we know they are present? Actually, no: the secret word has R, I, E? So we must have them? Yes? Because they are present? So the next guess must include them? Not necessarily? Why?\n\nActually, technically, we don\'t have to include all the known letters? But it\'s efficient to do so? Because we can test them in new positions.\n\nMoreover, if we don\'t include a known letter, we don\'t get information about its position? So we should include them.\n\nSo: the next guess should include R, I, E and two new letters? Also, avoid A and S? So yes.\n\nAnd we need to avoid the positions that we already ruled out: \n- R: not at position 1? And we don\'t know about positions 2,3,4,5? Actually, positions 1: R cannot be? But we can put R at 2?\nWe can put R at any position except 1? Since position 1 was tested and wrong? Similarly, I cannot be at 3? So we can put I at 1,2,4,5? And E cannot be at 5? So E at positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo for our next guess, we want to assign R to a position other than 1, I to a position other than 3, and E to a position other than 5.\n\nMoreover, we use two new letters? And we get feedback on them? So we choose common consonants? And vowel? But we have I and E? So consonants? \n\nPossible words:\n\nLet me try E at position 1? And R at position 2? Or something else.\n\nFor example:\n- Position 1: E? (E can be at 1? Yes)\n- Position 2: I? (I can be at 2? Yes) but wait, then what about R? We need a place for R.\n\nExample: ""EIRIE""? No, it has duplicate E? Also, EIRIE is five letters? But it\'s obscure? Not common? We want a valid word.\n\nAnother idea: ""BRIEF""?\n- B (new) at 1\n- R at 2\n- I at 3 -> wait, position 3: we know I cannot be at 3? So same issue? So if we put I at 3, we get -? Which we already know? So redundant? We don\'t get new position? Because when we put I at 3, it\'s present but wrong? But we know it\'s not at 3? So we don\'t get whether it\'s at 3? We know it\'s not? So we are wasting a position? So don\'t put I at 3.\n\nSimilarly, avoid putting R at 1? And E at 5? \n\nNow, BRIEF: \nPosition 3: I -> we avoid because we already know I is wrong at position 3? So no.\n\nAlternative: ""CRIER"" -> \nPosition 1: C (new)\nPosition 2: R (test R at 2? Then if R is at 2, we get ✓? But we don\'t know? Position 2 is new? So okay? But we also have I at position 3 -> we know I is not at 3? So again, I at 3 will give -? which we already know? And E at 4? That\'s okay? Then R at the end? but there are two R\'s? \n\nIn ""CRIER"": \nLetters: C, R, I, E, R -> but the secret word? It might have duplicate R? But we don\'t know? So we have R at position 2 and 5? If we put R at position 2? And R at position 5? But we already know R is in the word? This might complicate.\n\nBut also, I at 3: we know it\'s wrong? So we don\'t get new information? \n\nPerhaps a better word: ""DOZER""? But contains S? Wait, not? DOZER: D,O,Z,E,R -> E at position 4? But where is I? Not present? We must have I? Because it\'s a known letter? Yes? The secret word has I? So we must include I? Otherwise, I will be absent? But we know it\'s present? So the next guess must include the letters? Otherwise, we don\'t get position information? And also, if we don\'t include I, we might not find its position? \n\nSo we must include R, I, E? Yes? Unless the secret word has duplicate? But for safety, we include them? So the next guess must include the letters R, I, E? And two other letters? Not A or S? And also, avoid placing I at position 3, E at position 5, R at position 1.\n\nSo we need a word that doesn\'t have R at position 1, I at position 3, E at position 5? And includes R, I, E? And two more letters? Excluding A and S? \n\nWhat are some words? \n\nConsider: \n""RIVET""? \n- Position 1: R -> but we tried R at position 1 and got -? So we know R is not at position 1? So if we put R at position 1 again? We will get - again? So it\'s redundant? We should not put R at position 1? So avoid? \n\nTherefore, in ""RIVET"":\nPosition 1: R -> avoid? Because we already know? So we get - if we put it? Not efficient? So choose a word without R at position 1? And without I at position 3? And without E at position 5? \n\nAlternative: ""PRICE"" -> \nPosition 1: P (new)\nPosition 2: R (test at 2? Good? No problem? Because R is not required to be at 1? and position 2 not tested)\nPosition 3: I -> avoid? Because position 3 for I is already ruled out? So we put I at 3? Don\'t? It will give -? Which we already know? So not efficient? What if we try ""PRICE"", if we put I at 3? Then feedback if I is at position 3? It would show ✓? But we know it\'s not? Because from first guess it was at position 3 and got -? So it won\'t be ✓? So it must be - again? So we learn nothing new? So we waste? \n\nThen we want: \nPosition 1: new letter? And not R? So for me, it\'s best to avoid positions for the present letters that we already know are wrong? \n\nSo for R, we know it is not at position 1? So for next guess, put R at 2,3,4, or 5? Similarly, we know I is not at position 3? So put I at 1,2,4,5? And similarly, E not at 5? At 1,2,3,4? \n\nAnd also, we want to cover common letters? Because there are two more letters? \n\nFor instance, let\'s put R at 3? That\'s okay? Position 3 for R: we haven\'t tested? \n\nSimilarly, put I at 4? We haven\'t tested position 4 for I? \n\nPut E at 4? For example? Then we only know one position for E? \n\nSample word: ""MIRTH""? But then E is missing? Oh, we must have E? So we need E? \n\nAnother word: ""DRIVE"" - \nD, R, I, V, E\nPosition 1: D (new)\nPosition 2: R (test R at 2)\nPosition 3: I (but we know I not at 3? So we are wasting the position 3? We know it\'s not there? So we get -? And then we know R and I are present? But we don\'t get new information for I? \nPosition 4: V (new)\nPosition 5: E -> wait, E at position 5? We have feedback that E is not at position 5? So if we put E at position 5? We will get - because it\'s present but not at 5? Which we know? So inefficient? \n\nAvoid E at 5.\n\nSo ""DRIVE"" is bad because of I at 3? and E at 5? both of which we know are wrong positions? \n\nAnother word: ""ENDOW""? Then we have E at position 1? But then R and I are missing? Skip? \n\nWe must have R, I, E? \n\nThen how about ""Wiper""? But W is a letter? But ""wiper"" has letters: W, I, P, E, R -> \nPosition 1: W (new)\nPosition 2: I (test I at 2: we haven\'t tried I at 2 before)\nPosition 3: P (new) \nPosition 4: E (test E at 4: haven\'t tried before)\nPosition 5: R (test R at 5: haven\'t tried)\n\nAnd we avoid: \n- I at position 3? We put I at position 2? Which is new? \n- E not at position 5? We put E at 4? \n- R not at position 1? We put R at the end? Not at 1? \n\nPerfect! So ""WIPER"" is a valid word? \n\nIs ""WIPER"" a valid English word? Yes: a device for wiping surfaces, or a person who wipes.\n\nWe also avoid A and S.\n\nFeedback rules: \n- In WIPER, letters: \n  Position 1: W -> new? It might be x, it might be present and what position? \n  Position 2: I -> we know I is present? What position? If I is at position 2? We get ✓? Otherwise - (if it\'s in but not at 2)\n  Position 3: P -> new? Will be x or - or ✓?\n  Position 4: E -> similarly, if at 4 ✓? Otherwise -\n  Position 5: R -> similarly, if at 5 ✓? Otherwise -\n\nAnd we get more information? \n\nAlso, We cover new common letters: W, P? But yes.\n\nAlternative: ""OLDER""? But doesn\'t have R, I, E? Only E? Skip? \n\nSo I think ""WIPER"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check: or ""HIRED"" -> \nH, I, R, E, D\nPositions:\n1: H\n2: I (new for I? Position 2? Avoid position 3 for I? Good)\n3: R (new for R? Position 3? not tested? Good)\n4: E (new? position 4? not 5? Good)\n5: D\n\nBut we have R at position 3? and I at 2? E at 4? \n\nIs ""HIRED"" a common word? Yes? \n\nCompare to WIPER? Both work? \n\nBut in WIPER, we have P? Which is a common consonant? Or HIRED has H and D? \n\nBoth are okay? \n\nBut we want to maximize new letter information? So in WIPER, we use W and P? In HIRED, we use H and D? \n\nBut W is less common? H and D are more common? So perhaps HIRED is better? \n\nMoreover, in HIRED: we don\'t repeat any positions that we already know? \nI now at position 2? (against position 3 of first guess being wrong? But position 2 was A in first guess? A is absent? So position 2 is available? \nPosition 3 in HIRED is R? We had I at position 3 in RAISE? But I was at 3 and we know it\'s not correct? But position 3 itself? We didn\'t test the letter R at position 3? We tested S at position 4? etc. \n\nPosition 3 in RAISE: I -> -, meaning the letter I is present but position 3 is incorrect? But positional feedback per letter? \n\nSo in HIRED, we avoid placing the same letter at the position it was known to be wrong? We also avoid placing any letter that we know is absent? \n\nSo yes? \n\nBut in HIRED, we have E at position 4? Which was not tested before? \n\nSimilarly, R at position 3? \n\nAlso, we have I at position 2? Which is a new position? \n\nSo it works? \n\nAnother possibility: ""BRIEF"" has I at position 3 so bad? \n\nYes? \n\nFor now, I think ""HIRED"" is a good choice? Or ""WIPER""? \n\nBut we also want to consider: the secret word does not have A and S? So we are safe for today? \n\nPerhaps ""HIRED"" is a bit better? \n\nBut ""WIPER"" offers more uncommon letters? So that might be good to rule out rare letters? \n\nEither is fine? \n\nI\'ll choose ""HIRED"" for simplicity.\n\nBut wait, in ""HIRED"", position 5: D? But we also know? We can find out.\n\nActually, I don\'t think one is clearly better? \n\nI think ""HIRED"" or ""PRIDE""? ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E? \nPosition 1: P -> new? \nPosition 2: R -> put R at 2? New? \nPosition 3: I -> but we know that position 3 is wrong for I? So why? If we put I at 3? We already know it\'s not there? So we get -? Wasted? \n\nSimilarly, E at position 5: but we know E is not at position 5? So we put E at 5? Get -? Wasted.\n\nSo ""PRIDE"" is bad? \n\nSo ""HIRED"" is better? \n\nIn fact, ""HIRED"" has: \nI at 2 -> new position? \nR at 3 -> new for R? \nE at 4 -> new position? \nAnd position 1: H? \nPosition 5: D? \n\nAnd the word ""HIRED"" is common? \n\nSimilarly, ""WIPER"" has: \nI at 2? \nE at 4? \nR at 5? \nPosition 1: W? \nPosition 3: P? \n\nBoth avoid the bad positions? \n\nAnother one: ""TRIED"" -> \nPosition 1: T \nPosition 2: R \nPosition 3: I -> avoid? because I at 3 is wrong? That we know? So we put I at 3? Then redundant? So ""TRIED"" is bad? \n\nIndeed? \n\nSo avoid words that put I at 3? \n\nTherefore, ""HIRED"" or ""WIPER""? \n\nBut ""HIRED"" has E at position 4? And in RAISE, E was at position 5? But position 4 and 5 are different? \n\nSo yes? \n\nLet\'s decide on ""HIRED"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked with ""(-)"").  \n- A is absent from the secret word (marked with ""(x)"").  \n- I is in the secret word but not in position 3 (marked with ""(-)"").  \n- S is absent from the secret word (marked with ""(x)"").  \n- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (marked with ""(-)"").  \n\n### Key Inferences:\n1. **Present Letters**: R, I, and E must appear in the secret word.  \n2. **Absent Letters**: A and S are eliminated.  \n3. **Position Constraints**:  \n   - R cannot be in position 1.  \n   - I cannot be in position 3.  \n   - E cannot be in position 5.  \n\n### Strategy for Second Guess:\n- **Must Include**: R, I, and E to test new positions.  \n- **Must Avoid**: A, S, and placing R at 1, I at 3, or E at 5.  \n- **Secondary Goal**: Cover new common consonants (e.g., H, D) to gather more information.  \n- **Optimal Word Choice**: ""HIRED"" fits perfectly:  \n  - Puts I at position 2 (new position, not yet tested).  \n  - Puts R at position 3 (new position for R, avoiding position 1).  \n  - Puts E at position 4 (new position, avoiding position 5).  \n  - Introduces new letters H (position 1) and D (position 5) to test their presence/absence.  \n\n""HIRED"" is a common English word and efficiently leverages all known constraints.\n\n<guess>HIRED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: HIRED -> FEEDBACK: H(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE → 
- R: (-) → R is in the word, but not at position 1.
- A: (x) → A is not in the word.
- I: (-) → I is in the word, but not at position 3.
- S: (x) → S is not in the word.
- E: (-) → E is in the word, position 5 is wrong.

Guess 2: HIRED → 
- H: (x) → H is not in the word.
- I: (✓) → I is at position 2 (correct).
- R: (-) → R is in the word, but not at position 3 (since it was placed at position 3 in this guess).
- E: (✓) → E is at position 4 (correct).
- D: (-) → D is in the word, but not at position 5.

New information:

1. **I is confirmed at position 2** (I(✓) in HIRED).
2. **E is confirmed at position 4** (E(✓) in HIRED).
3. **R is present** but it cannot be at position 1 (from RAISE) or position 3 (from HIRED). So R must be at position 5? Since positions: 1: cannot be R (from RAISE), now position 3 cannot be R (from HIRED), and the only remaining spot is position 5? Because we know positions: 
   - Position 1: cannot be R? We have HIRED: position 1 is H, which is absent? So position 1 is open? But R cannot be at position 1? But position 1 hasn't been confirmed? 
   However, from RAISE, R at position 1 got (-), meaning R is present but not at 1? So positions 2,3,4,5 were possible? But in HIRED:
   - Position 1: H (absent? H is not in the word at all? So position 1 is neither R nor any other known? 
   - Position 2: I -> correct? So we know position 2 must be I? And R cannot be at position 2? Because position 2 is I? Yes, position 2 is occupied by I? 
   - Position 3: R placed? Got (-) meaning R is present but not at position 3? 
   - Position 4: E -> correct? So E is at position 4? And R cannot be at position 4? 
   - Position 5: D -> got (-) meaning D is present but not at position 5? 

Therefore, the possible positions for R:
- Cannot be at position 1 (from RAISE).
- Cannot be at position 3 (from HIRED).
- Position 2 is taken by I? Yes, position 2: I(✓) for HIRED? So it's I? 
- Position 4 is taken by E? Yes, E(✓) for HIRED? So it's E? 
So the only possible position for R is position 5? 

Similarly, D is present but not at position 5? So D can be at positions 1 or 3? Because position 1: H is absent? Position 3: R doesn't work? So we have:
- Position 1: ? 
- Position 2: I (fixed).
- Position 3: ? 
- Position 4: E (fixed).
- Position 5: ? 

But R is present? So it must be at position 5? Why? Because positions: 
1: cannot be R? 
2: I? not R?
3: from feedback: R at position 3 is incorrect? 
4: E? not R? 
5: not tested for R directly? 

So position 5 must be R? Or it could be? 

However, positions 1 and 3 are both unoccupied? But R must be in the word? And if R is at position 5? Then D? 

But D is also present? And D is at position 5? 

Wait: Position 5 in HIRED: D -> (-) meaning D is in the word but not at position 5? So R cannot be at position 5? 

Wait, no? Position 5 cannot be R? Because D is at position 5? But it's not correct? So position 5 is not D? But then R: position 5 hasn't been tested? 

Contradictions:
- Position 1: we know R cannot be? Because in RAISE, it was at position 1: R(-). 
- Position 3: in HIRED, R was at position 3: R(-). 
- Position 2 and 4 are taken by I and E? 
- Then R must be at position 5? 

But in HIRED, position 5: D -> (-)? Meaning D is present? Not at position 5? So position 5 is not D? Then what about R? 

Therefore, we conclude? R must be at position 5? Because there's no other spot? 

Thus we know: 
- Position 2: I
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: must be R? 

Moreover: D is in the word? But not at position 5? So D must be at position 1 or 3? 

But position 1: wasn't tested? And position 3: wasn't tested? 

Additionally, H is absent? So position 1: cannot be H? And we tried H? 

So the secret word so far: 
Position 1: ? 
Position 2: I
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: E
Position 5: R? (must be R because the secret word has R and only position 5 is left? And also, if R is at 5? Then in HIRED: 
Position 5: D? But we got D(-)? Meaning D is not at 5? Which is consistent? 

But why R at 5? 
Because the word must contain R? And the positions where R can be are only 5? 

Is that correct? 
From RAISE: R at 1: wrong? So R at 2,3,4,5? 
In HIRED: 
Position 3: R -> wrong? So R cannot be at 3? 
Moreover, position 2: is I? So R cannot be at 2? Because letter? 
Position 4: is E? So R cannot be at 4? 
Therefore R must be at position 5? 

Similarly: 
E must be at position 4? Already? 

Now, what about D: 
We got D(-) meaning D is present? Position? 
D cannot be at position 5? Because that's R? So D must be at position 1 or 3? 

So now: 
Position 1: could be D or another letter? But D is present? And not at position 5? So it can be at position 1 or 3? 
Position 3: similarly? 

Also, we know the word has D? 

And position 1? What? 

We also have a missing letter? 

But we know? From feedback: 
- Present letters: R, I, E, D? And from the beginning? 

So the word has R, I, E, D? And one more? 

But we don't have the fifth letter? Because we tried two letters: H and D? H is absent? 

So the secret word has letters: I at position 2, E at position 4, R at position 5? Then D must be at position 1 or 3? And the other letter? Position 3 or 1? 

But we don't know? So there might be a fifth letter? 

If D is at position 1? Then position 3? Must be an unknown letter? 

If D is at position 3? Then position 1? Must be an unknown letter? 

But we don't know what letter? 

We also have constraints: 
- A and S are absent? H is absent? 
- Previous absent letters: A, S, H? And others? 

So what letters are possible? 

Now, for the next guess, we need to find the remaining letter? 

Moreover, we know D is present? But not at position 5? So we have to test position 1 and 3? 

Additionally, we must form a valid word? 

So what are possible secret words? 

Pattern: _ I _ E R 

With D in one of the blanks? 

So: 
Option: word has D at position 1? Then position 3? Unknown? But must be a letter? 

What words: 
- DI?ER -> but E at position 4? R at 5? 
Possible: D I ? E R 

Similarly, if D at position 3: then position 1? Letter: so ? I D E R 

Known words: 
- ""RIDER""? But has duplicate R? But R at position 5? Then position 1 is R? But then R is twice? 
But we have feedback: in the previous? 

We haven't tested? 

Similarly, ""CIDER"" is possible? 

But we need to test? 

We can try a word that fills position 1 with a letter that covers possibilities? 

For the next guess, we can try to guess a word that includes the letter D? And tests position 1 and position 3? 

Also, the letter? 

We know: 
- Position 1: not H? Because H is absent? And not A, S? 
- Position 3: not A, S? 

Possible common words: 
First, ""CIDER"": 
- C at 1? 
- I at 2? 
- D at 3? 
- E at 4? 
- R at 5? 

This has D at position 3? 

Similarly, ""TIMER"" is invalid? Because E at position 4? But we must use? Position 5? But we know? 

We don't need? 

But if we try ""CIDER"", then it fits? 

Similarly, if D at position 1: ""DINER""? But N? 

So. 

But in our case, we haven't confirmed? 

Therefore, the secret word could be:
- ""CIDER"": C, I, D, E, R
- Or ""DINER"": D, I, N, E, R
- Or ""RIDER"": R, I, D, E, R? But then R at position 1? But we know R cannot be at position 1? Because from RAISE? And position 1: if R at 1? It would be wrong? So ""RIDER"" cannot be? Because position 1 is R? Which we already know is incorrect? 

Similarly, ""DIVER"": D, I, V, E, R? 
But note we have S? And A? But absent? 

So possible words: 
- ""CIDER""
- ""DINER""
- ""DIVER""
- ""FILER""? But S? F,I,L,E,R? But L? 
But we must have no? 

Now, the letter for position 3? What? 

How do we distinguish? 

We can try: 
Our next guess can be ""CIDER"" or similar? But then we are guessing? But we have three tries left? 

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that tests possible letters? 

But we know that D is present? And can be at position 1 or 3? 

So in our next guess, we can use D at position 3? And also include common letters? 

Or better, put D at position 1? To test if D is at position 1? For example? 

But if we put D at position 1? Then position 3? We can put a letter? 

Consider ""DOBER"" Not five? Or ""DINER"" -> but then we have D at position 1? 

If we guess ""DINER"", then:
- Position 1: D -> it could be ✓ or - ? 
  If D is at position 1? Then ✓? 
  If D is at position 3? Then -? 
- Position 3: N -> if secret word is ""CIDER"", then c position: if N? Then ""CIDER"" has I at 2? D at 3? E at 4? R at 5? So position 3: D? So N: absent? Or if secret word is ""DIVER"", then D at 1? So position 3 is V? 
Then N? 
So if we guess ""DINER"": 
- If secret word is ""CIDER"": 
  Position 1: D -> - (because D is at position 3? In ""CIDER"", D is the third letter? So position 1 is C? But D at 1? It is absent? No? D is present? At position 3? So position 1: D -> -? Because D is present but not at position 1? 
- Position 2: I -> ✓? 
- Position 3: N -> x? Because not? 
- Position 4: E -> ✓? 
- Position 5: R -> ✓? 

Similarly, if the secret word is ""CIDER"", then feedback for DINER: D(-), I(✓), N(x), E(✓), R(✓)? 

But then we don't know the position? 

Another possibility: we know that the secret word has only one missing letter? 

We can try ""DRIVE""? But no? Then E at 5? But we have? 

Perhaps a word that includes the letter C? Since it's common? 

Therefore, we might guess ""CIDER"" as a probe? 

Then:
- If ""CIDER"" is correct: we get ✓ for all? 
- Else: 
  - Position 1: C -> ? 
  - Position 2: I(✓) 
  - Position 3: D -> ? Could be ✓ or - 
  - Position 4: E(✓) 
  - Position 5: R(✓) 

But since we know position 5 must be R? And position 4 E? Position 2 I? 

So we want to know position 1 and 3? 

Similarly, if D is at position 1? Then ""CIDER"" would have D at position 3? So if the secret word has D at position 1? Then C at position 1? But then position 1: C in ""CIDER"" becomes absent? 

But then how? 

This might be confusing? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't assume position 1 and 3? So that we can test multiple possibilities? 

For example: we don't know what letter is at position 1 and position 3? And D is at one of them? But the word has five letters? So position 1: a letter? Position 3: a letter? 

Instead of guessing a specific word? 

So try ""DAILY""? Avoid? 

But we can use common letters? 

Another idea: ""UNDER""? But E? 

Not? 

Perhaps ""TRIBE""? But has E? 

Position 4 is E? And position 5 R? 

But we need to test? 

I think the best is to form the word with known letters? 

But we know the secret word has I at 2, E at 4, R at 5? Plus two letters D and another? Or D and C? etc. 

So ""CIDER"" is a very likely candidate? 

Similarly, ""DINER""? Or ""RIPER""? Not? 

Also, ""DIVER""? 

But we have a previous absent: H? 

So what is common? ""CIDER"" is a word? 

To maximize information? We can try ""CHIDE""? But E not at the end? 

No? 

Then ""DONUT""? But no I? 

Not? 

We have to include? 

Therefore, let us choose ""CIDER"" for the next guess? 

If it works, great? Otherwise, we get feedback to deduce? 

And we have 4 tries left? 

Also, if ""CIDER"": 
- Position 1: C? If not? Then feedback will tell if C is present? 
- Position 3: D? If D is at position 3? Then it would be ✓? And then the word? 

Similarly, if D is at position 1? Then position 3: we have D at position 3? But D is already? Actually? 

Secret word: if D is at position 1? Then position 3: another letter? 

So in ""CIDER"", 
Position 1: C? Might be absent? 
Position 3: D? So feedback: 
- C: If present? Position? 
  - If at position 1: ✓? 
  - Else: -? 
- D: at position 3: 
  - If secret word has D at position 3: ✓? 
  - If secret word has D at position 1: then at position 3? D would be: absent? Or - if D is also at position 3? 
But a letter? D? 

Actually, if the secret word is ""DINER"": D at 1, N at 3? 
Then in ""CIDER"":
- Position 1: C -> not D? And C not in the word? So x? 
- Position 2: I -> ✓? 
- Position 3: D -> but D is at position 1 in secret? So D is present? But not at position 3? So -? 
- Position 4: E -> ✓? 
- Position 5: R -> ✓? 

Feedback: C(x) I(✓) D(-) E(✓) R(✓)? 

Similarly, if the secret word is ""CIDER""? Then all ✓? 

And if ""DIVER""? 
""DIVER"": positions: D at 1, I at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
Then ""CIDER"": 
Position 1: C -> not? V? So absent? X? 
Position 2: I -> ✓? 
Position 3: D -> but secret has V? D is in the secret? But at position 1? Not 3? So -? 
Position 4: E -> ✓? 
Position 5: R -> ✓? 

Same feedback as above? 

To distinguish between ""DINER"" and ""DIVER""? We'd have the same feedback? For any word having position 1: unknown letter? 

Therefore, after getting this feedback, we don't know the letter? 

Unless we choose a word that has a common letter? 

Perhaps better to choose a word that addresses specifically position 1 and 3? 

For example: ""CATER""? But has A? A is absent? 

No? 

""ORDER""? But duplicate O? 

Not? 

Perhaps ""OLDER""? But E? 

Not? 

Another idea: ""DOZEN""? E? 

Position 4 is E? So it must be? 

But we can try ""DECOR""? 
D,E,C,O,R? 
Then positions:
1: D
2: E? But we have I at 2? So conflict? 

We must leave position 2 and 4 intact? 

So we must guess a word with 
Position 1: (unknown? But to test)
Position 2: I? to keep it? 
Position 3: (test letter? But)
Position 4: E? fixed? 
Position 5: R? fixed? 

So the next guess is fixed pattern: ? I ? E R 

We must choose it? 

We can choose:
""CI?ER"" or ""DI?ER""? 

We know D is present? So if we put D at position 1? Then position 3? Must be a letter? 

Similarly, if we put D at position 3? Then position 1? 

But how to test? 

So let us choose ""DINER"" for the next guess? So we have:

Guess: ""DINER""

If D is at position 1? Then D(✓) I(✓) ? 

But if the secret word is ""CIDER""? Then D at position 1: ? It is not? So D(-) 

Similarly, position 3: N? If secret has C? At position 1 and D at 3? Then N: absent? 

So feedback: 
- If secret word: ""CIDER"" -> D(-) I(✓) N(x) E(✓) R(✓)? 
- If secret word: ""DINER"" -> D(✓) I(✓) N(✓) E(✓) R(✓)? 
- If secret word: ""DIVER"" -> D(✓) I(✓) N(x) E(✓) R(✓)? And V? Not? 

We don't care? 

But with ""DINER"", we can identify if it's ""DINER"": all ✓? 
Otherwise, it's not? 

So we can then deduce? 

If we get all ✓? Done? Otherwise, we know it's one of the other? Like ""CIDER"", ""DIVER"", etc., and then next guess? 

I think it's reasonable? 

So let's go with ""DINER""?

### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: RAISE**  
  - R(-): R is in the word but not at position 1.  
  - A(x): A is absent.  
  - I(-): I is in the word but not at position 3.  
  - S(x): S is absent.  
  - E(-): E is in the word but not at position 5.  
  - **Inferences**:  
    - The secret word must contain R, I, E.  
    - A and S are absent.  
    - R cannot be at position 1, I cannot be at position 3, E cannot be at position 5.  

- **Guess 2: HIRED**  
  - H(x): H is absent.  
  - I(✓): I is confirmed at position 2.  
  - R(-): R is in the word but not at position 3 (since position 2 is I, position 4 is E, and position 1 is invalid, R must be at position 5).  
  - E(✓): E is confirmed at position 4.  
  - D(-): D is in the word but not at position 5 (R is at position 5).  
  - **Inferences**:  
    - I is fixed at position 2, E is fixed at position 4.  
    - R is fixed at position 5 (deduced from prior constraints).  
    - D is present but not at position 5, so it must be at position 1 or 3.  
    - H is absent.  
    - The remaining positions (1 and 3) must include D and one unknown letter.  
    - Possible secret words: Forms like _ I _ E R (e.g., CIDER, DINER, DIVER).  

### Strategy for Third Guess
- **Goal**: Test position 1 and 3 for D and the unknown letter.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Guess **DINER** to efficiently test:  
    - Position 1: D → If ✓, D is at position 1; if (-), D is at position 3.  
    - Position 3: N → Can reveal the unknown letter.  
  - Provides clarity on D's position and identifies the missing letter if DINER is incorrect.  
- **Word Choice**:  
  - DINER uses known constraints (I at 2, E at 4, R at 5).  
  - Tests D at position 1 and introduces N at position 3 to probe missing letter.  

<guess>DINER</guess>",DINER,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE → 
- R: (-) → R is in the word, but not at position 1.
- A: (x) → A is not in the word.
- I: (-) → I is in the word, but not at position 3.
- S: (x) → S is not in the word.
- E: (-) → E is in the word, position 5 is wrong.

Guess 2: HIRED → 
- H: (x) → H is not in the word.
- I: (✓) → I is at position 2 (correct).
- R: (-) → R is in the word, but not at position 3 (since it was placed at position 3 in this guess).
- E: (✓) → E is at position 4 (correct).
- D: (-) → D is in the word, but not at position 5.

New information:

1. **I is confirmed at position 2** (I(✓) in HIRED).
2. **E is confirmed at position 4** (E(✓) in HIRED).
3. **R is present** but it cannot be at position 1 (from RAISE) or position 3 (from HIRED). So R must be at position 5? Since positions: 1: cannot be R (from RAISE), now position 3 cannot be R (from HIRED), and the only remaining spot is position 5? Because we know positions: 
   - Position 1: cannot be R? We have HIRED: position 1 is H, which is absent? So position 1 is open? But R cannot be at position 1? But position 1 hasn't been confirmed? 
   However, from RAISE, R at position 1 got (-), meaning R is present but not at 1? So positions 2,3,4,5 were possible? But in HIRED:
   - Position 1: H (absent? H is not in the word at all? So position 1 is neither R nor any other known? 
   - Position 2: I -> correct? So we know position 2 must be I? And R cannot be at position 2? Because position 2 is I? Yes, position 2 is occupied by I? 
   - Position 3: R placed? Got (-) meaning R is present but not at position 3? 
   - Position 4: E -> correct? So E is at position 4? And R cannot be at position 4? 
   - Position 5: D -> got (-) meaning D is present but not at position 5? 

Therefore, the possible positions for R:
- Cannot be at position 1 (from RAISE).
- Cannot be at position 3 (from HIRED).
- Position 2 is taken by I? Yes, position 2: I(✓) for HIRED? So it's I? 
- Position 4 is taken by E? Yes, E(✓) for HIRED? So it's E? 
So the only possible position for R is position 5? 

Similarly, D is present but not at position 5? So D can be at positions 1 or 3? Because position 1: H is absent? Position 3: R doesn't work? So we have:
- Position 1: ? 
- Position 2: I (fixed).
- Position 3: ? 
- Position 4: E (fixed).
- Position 5: ? 

But R is present? So it must be at position 5? Why? Because positions: 
1: cannot be R? 
2: I? not R?
3: from feedback: R at position 3 is incorrect? 
4: E? not R? 
5: not tested for R directly? 

So position 5 must be R? Or it could be? 

However, positions 1 and 3 are both unoccupied? But R must be in the word? And if R is at position 5? Then D? 

But D is also present? And D is at position 5? 

Wait: Position 5 in HIRED: D -> (-) meaning D is in the word but not at position 5? So R cannot be at position 5? 

Wait, no? Position 5 cannot be R? Because D is at position 5? But it's not correct? So position 5 is not D? But then R: position 5 hasn't been tested? 

Contradictions:
- Position 1: we know R cannot be? Because in RAISE, it was at position 1: R(-). 
- Position 3: in HIRED, R was at position 3: R(-). 
- Position 2 and 4 are taken by I and E? 
- Then R must be at position 5? 

But in HIRED, position 5: D -> (-)? Meaning D is present? Not at position 5? So position 5 is not D? Then what about R? 

Therefore, we conclude? R must be at position 5? Because there's no other spot? 

Thus we know: 
- Position 2: I
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: must be R? 

Moreover: D is in the word? But not at position 5? So D must be at position 1 or 3? 

But position 1: wasn't tested? And position 3: wasn't tested? 

Additionally, H is absent? So position 1: cannot be H? And we tried H? 

So the secret word so far: 
Position 1: ? 
Position 2: I
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: E
Position 5: R? (must be R because the secret word has R and only position 5 is left? And also, if R is at 5? Then in HIRED: 
Position 5: D? But we got D(-)? Meaning D is not at 5? Which is consistent? 

But why R at 5? 
Because the word must contain R? And the positions where R can be are only 5? 

Is that correct? 
From RAISE: R at 1: wrong? So R at 2,3,4,5? 
In HIRED: 
Position 3: R -> wrong? So R cannot be at 3? 
Moreover, position 2: is I? So R cannot be at 2? Because letter? 
Position 4: is E? So R cannot be at 4? 
Therefore R must be at position 5? 

Similarly: 
E must be at position 4? Already? 

Now, what about D: 
We got D(-) meaning D is present? Position? 
D cannot be at position 5? Because that's R? So D must be at position 1 or 3? 

So now: 
Position 1: could be D or another letter? But D is present? And not at position 5? So it can be at position 1 or 3? 
Position 3: similarly? 

Also, we know the word has D? 

And position 1? What? 

We also have a missing letter? 

But we know? From feedback: 
- Present letters: R, I, E, D? And from the beginning? 

So the word has R, I, E, D? And one more? 

But we don't have the fifth letter? Because we tried two letters: H and D? H is absent? 

So the secret word has letters: I at position 2, E at position 4, R at position 5? Then D must be at position 1 or 3? And the other letter? Position 3 or 1? 

But we don't know? So there might be a fifth letter? 

If D is at position 1? Then position 3? Must be an unknown letter? 

If D is at position 3? Then position 1? Must be an unknown letter? 

But we don't know what letter? 

We also have constraints: 
- A and S are absent? H is absent? 
- Previous absent letters: A, S, H? And others? 

So what letters are possible? 

Now, for the next guess, we need to find the remaining letter? 

Moreover, we know D is present? But not at position 5? So we have to test position 1 and 3? 

Additionally, we must form a valid word? 

So what are possible secret words? 

Pattern: _ I _ E R 

With D in one of the blanks? 

So: 
Option: word has D at position 1? Then position 3? Unknown? But must be a letter? 

What words: 
- DI?ER -> but E at position 4? R at 5? 
Possible: D I ? E R 

Similarly, if D at position 3: then position 1? Letter: so ? I D E R 

Known words: 
- ""RIDER""? But has duplicate R? But R at position 5? Then position 1 is R? But then R is twice? 
But we have feedback: in the previous? 

We haven't tested? 

Similarly, ""CIDER"" is possible? 

But we need to test? 

We can try a word that fills position 1 with a letter that covers possibilities? 

For the next guess, we can try to guess a word that includes the letter D? And tests position 1 and position 3? 

Also, the letter? 

We know: 
- Position 1: not H? Because H is absent? And not A, S? 
- Position 3: not A, S? 

Possible common words: 
First, ""CIDER"": 
- C at 1? 
- I at 2? 
- D at 3? 
- E at 4? 
- R at 5? 

This has D at position 3? 

Similarly, ""TIMER"" is invalid? Because E at position 4? But we must use? Position 5? But we know? 

We don't need? 

But if we try ""CIDER"", then it fits? 

Similarly, if D at position 1: ""DINER""? But N? 

So. 

But in our case, we haven't confirmed? 

Therefore, the secret word could be:
- ""CIDER"": C, I, D, E, R
- Or ""DINER"": D, I, N, E, R
- Or ""RIDER"": R, I, D, E, R? But then R at position 1? But we know R cannot be at position 1? Because from RAISE? And position 1: if R at 1? It would be wrong? So ""RIDER"" cannot be? Because position 1 is R? Which we already know is incorrect? 

Similarly, ""DIVER"": D, I, V, E, R? 
But note we have S? And A? But absent? 

So possible words: 
- ""CIDER""
- ""DINER""
- ""DIVER""
- ""FILER""? But S? F,I,L,E,R? But L? 
But we must have no? 

Now, the letter for position 3? What? 

How do we distinguish? 

We can try: 
Our next guess can be ""CIDER"" or similar? But then we are guessing? But we have three tries left? 

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that tests possible letters? 

But we know that D is present? And can be at position 1 or 3? 

So in our next guess, we can use D at position 3? And also include common letters? 

Or better, put D at position 1? To test if D is at position 1? For example? 

But if we put D at position 1? Then position 3? We can put a letter? 

Consider ""DOBER"" Not five? Or ""DINER"" -> but then we have D at position 1? 

If we guess ""DINER"", then:
- Position 1: D -> it could be ✓ or - ? 
  If D is at position 1? Then ✓? 
  If D is at position 3? Then -? 
- Position 3: N -> if secret word is ""CIDER"", then c position: if N? Then ""CIDER"" has I at 2? D at 3? E at 4? R at 5? So position 3: D? So N: absent? Or if secret word is ""DIVER"", then D at 1? So position 3 is V? 
Then N? 
So if we guess ""DINER"": 
- If secret word is ""CIDER"": 
  Position 1: D -> - (because D is at position 3? In ""CIDER"", D is the third letter? So position 1 is C? But D at 1? It is absent? No? D is present? At position 3? So position 1: D -> -? Because D is present but not at position 1? 
- Position 2: I -> ✓? 
- Position 3: N -> x? Because not? 
- Position 4: E -> ✓? 
- Position 5: R -> ✓? 

Similarly, if the secret word is ""CIDER"", then feedback for DINER: D(-), I(✓), N(x), E(✓), R(✓)? 

But then we don't know the position? 

Another possibility: we know that the secret word has only one missing letter? 

We can try ""DRIVE""? But no? Then E at 5? But we have? 

Perhaps a word that includes the letter C? Since it's common? 

Therefore, we might guess ""CIDER"" as a probe? 

Then:
- If ""CIDER"" is correct: we get ✓ for all? 
- Else: 
  - Position 1: C -> ? 
  - Position 2: I(✓) 
  - Position 3: D -> ? Could be ✓ or - 
  - Position 4: E(✓) 
  - Position 5: R(✓) 

But since we know position 5 must be R? And position 4 E? Position 2 I? 

So we want to know position 1 and 3? 

Similarly, if D is at position 1? Then ""CIDER"" would have D at position 3? So if the secret word has D at position 1? Then C at position 1? But then position 1: C in ""CIDER"" becomes absent? 

But then how? 

This might be confusing? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't assume position 1 and 3? So that we can test multiple possibilities? 

For example: we don't know what letter is at position 1 and position 3? And D is at one of them? But the word has five letters? So position 1: a letter? Position 3: a letter? 

Instead of guessing a specific word? 

So try ""DAILY""? Avoid? 

But we can use common letters? 

Another idea: ""UNDER""? But E? 

Not? 

Perhaps ""TRIBE""? But has E? 

Position 4 is E? And position 5 R? 

But we need to test? 

I think the best is to form the word with known letters? 

But we know the secret word has I at 2, E at 4, R at 5? Plus two letters D and another? Or D and C? etc. 

So ""CIDER"" is a very likely candidate? 

Similarly, ""DINER""? Or ""RIPER""? Not? 

Also, ""DIVER""? 

But we have a previous absent: H? 

So what is common? ""CIDER"" is a word? 

To maximize information? We can try ""CHIDE""? But E not at the end? 

No? 

Then ""DONUT""? But no I? 

Not? 

We have to include? 

Therefore, let us choose ""CIDER"" for the next guess? 

If it works, great? Otherwise, we get feedback to deduce? 

And we have 4 tries left? 

Also, if ""CIDER"": 
- Position 1: C? If not? Then feedback will tell if C is present? 
- Position 3: D? If D is at position 3? Then it would be ✓? And then the word? 

Similarly, if D is at position 1? Then position 3: we have D at position 3? But D is already? Actually? 

Secret word: if D is at position 1? Then position 3: another letter? 

So in ""CIDER"", 
Position 1: C? Might be absent? 
Position 3: D? So feedback: 
- C: If present? Position? 
  - If at position 1: ✓? 
  - Else: -? 
- D: at position 3: 
  - If secret word has D at position 3: ✓? 
  - If secret word has D at position 1: then at position 3? D would be: absent? Or - if D is also at position 3? 
But a letter? D? 

Actually, if the secret word is ""DINER"": D at 1, N at 3? 
Then in ""CIDER"":
- Position 1: C -> not D? And C not in the word? So x? 
- Position 2: I -> ✓? 
- Position 3: D -> but D is at position 1 in secret? So D is present? But not at position 3? So -? 
- Position 4: E -> ✓? 
- Position 5: R -> ✓? 

Feedback: C(x) I(✓) D(-) E(✓) R(✓)? 

Similarly, if the secret word is ""CIDER""? Then all ✓? 

And if ""DIVER""? 
""DIVER"": positions: D at 1, I at 2, V at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
Then ""CIDER"": 
Position 1: C -> not? V? So absent? X? 
Position 2: I -> ✓? 
Position 3: D -> but secret has V? D is in the secret? But at position 1? Not 3? So -? 
Position 4: E -> ✓? 
Position 5: R -> ✓? 

Same feedback as above? 

To distinguish between ""DINER"" and ""DIVER""? We'd have the same feedback? For any word having position 1: unknown letter? 

Therefore, after getting this feedback, we don't know the letter? 

Unless we choose a word that has a common letter? 

Perhaps better to choose a word that addresses specifically position 1 and 3? 

For example: ""CATER""? But has A? A is absent? 

No? 

""ORDER""? But duplicate O? 

Not? 

Perhaps ""OLDER""? But E? 

Not? 

Another idea: ""DOZEN""? E? 

Position 4 is E? So it must be? 

But we can try ""DECOR""? 
D,E,C,O,R? 
Then positions:
1: D
2: E? But we have I at 2? So conflict? 

We must leave position 2 and 4 intact? 

So we must guess a word with 
Position 1: (unknown? But to test)
Position 2: I? to keep it? 
Position 3: (test letter? But)
Position 4: E? fixed? 
Position 5: R? fixed? 

So the next guess is fixed pattern: ? I ? E R 

We must choose it? 

We can choose:
""CI?ER"" or ""DI?ER""? 

We know D is present? So if we put D at position 1? Then position 3? Must be a letter? 

Similarly, if we put D at position 3? Then position 1? 

But how to test? 

So let us choose ""DINER"" for the next guess? So we have:

Guess: ""DINER""

If D is at position 1? Then D(✓) I(✓) ? 

But if the secret word is ""CIDER""? Then D at position 1: ? It is not? So D(-) 

Similarly, position 3: N? If secret has C? At position 1 and D at 3? Then N: absent? 

So feedback: 
- If secret word: ""CIDER"" -> D(-) I(✓) N(x) E(✓) R(✓)? 
- If secret word: ""DINER"" -> D(✓) I(✓) N(✓) E(✓) R(✓)? 
- If secret word: ""DIVER"" -> D(✓) I(✓) N(x) E(✓) R(✓)? And V? Not? 

We don't care? 

But with ""DINER"", we can identify if it's ""DINER"": all ✓? 
Otherwise, it's not? 

So we can then deduce? 

If we get all ✓? Done? Otherwise, we know it's one of the other? Like ""CIDER"", ""DIVER"", etc., and then next guess? 

I think it's reasonable? 

So let's go with ""DINER""?### Analysis of Previous Feedback

    - R cannot be at position 1, I cannot be at position 3, E cannot be at position 5.  

- **Guess 2: HIRED**  
  - H(x): H is absent.  
  - I(✓): I is confirmed at position 2.  
  - R(-): R is in the word but not at position 3 (since position 2 is I, position 4 is E, and position 1 is invalid, R must be at position 5).  
  - E(✓): E is confirmed at position 4.  
  - D(-): D is in the word but not at position 5 (R is at position 5).  
  - **Inferences**:  
    - I is fixed at position 2, E is fixed at position 4.  
    - R is fixed at position 5 (deduced from prior constraints).  
    - D is present but not at position 5, so it must be at position 1 or 3.  
    - H is absent.  
    - The remaining positions (1 and 3) must include D and one unknown letter.  
    - Possible secret words: Forms like _ I _ E R (e.g., CIDER, DINER, DIVER).  

### Strategy for Third Guess
- **Goal**: Test position 1 and 3 for D and the unknown letter.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Guess **DINER** to efficiently test:  
    - Position 1: D → If ✓, D is at position 1; if (-), D is at position 3.  
    - Position 3: N → Can reveal the unknown letter.  
  - Provides clarity on D's position and identifies the missing letter if DINER is incorrect.  
- **Word Choice**:  
  - DINER uses known constraints (I at 2, E at 4, R at 5).  
  - Tests D at position 1 and introduces N at position 3 to probe missing letter.",Guess 3: DINER -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) I(✓) N(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
