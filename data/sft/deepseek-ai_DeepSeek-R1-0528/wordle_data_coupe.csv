We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, the secret word has:
- The letter 'C' in the first position.
- The letter 'E' in the fifth position.
- The letters 'R', 'A', and 'N' are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: C _ _ _ E

We know that the word does not contain R, A, or N. Also, since the first letter is C and the last is E, we can try to think of words that fit this pattern.

We must avoid using the letters R, A, N in our next guess.

Let's think of 5-letter words that start with C and end with E, and do not contain R, A, N.

Common letters that might appear in the middle: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

Possible words:
- CLOVE
- CHIME
- CHOSE
- CYCLE
- etc.

But note: we have two positions to figure out (second, third, and fourth). Actually, positions 2, 3, and 4 are unknown.

We should try a word that uses new letters and avoids R, A, N.

Let me list some words:
- CUBE: but that's 4 letters? No, 5-letter: CUBE is 4, so not valid.
- Valid 5-letter words: 
  - CHIME: C H I M E -> positions: C(1), H(2), I(3), M(4), E(5)
  - CHOLE: not common? 
  - CHOSE: C H O S E

But we don't know if H, O, S, etc. are in the word.

We can also consider words that have double letters? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

Another idea: use a word that has common consonants and vowels in the middle.

Vowels that are not A: E is already at the end, so we have I, O, U. We know E is at the end, but it might appear again? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicate letters, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, in this case, we have two E's? The first guess had E at the end and it was correct, but we don't know if there is another E.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed E as correct only at the end. If there were another E, it might have been indicated? Actually, the feedback per letter is independent. If the secret word has two E's, and we guess one E in the correct position and another E in a wrong position, it would show one ✓ and one - or x? But in this case, we only have one E in the guess (at the end) and it was correct. So we don't know if there are more E's.

But to be safe, we can avoid using E again in positions that are not the fifth? Actually, we can use E again to test if it appears elsewhere.

But for now, let's focus on new letters.

We have two positions to test: 2, 3, and 4. Actually three positions.

We can try a word that uses common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

Let me try to form a word: C _ _ _ E

Possible words (without R, A, N):
- CABLE: but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word).
- CEDED: has E again, and D. But we don't know about D.
- CHIDE: C H I D E -> H, I, D are new.
- CHIME: C H I M E -> H, I, M are new.
- CHOSE: C H O S E -> H, O, S are new.

I think ""CHOSE"" is a good candidate because it uses H, O, S which are common.

But note: we have to avoid R, A, N. ""CHOSE"" does not contain these.

Alternatively, ""CLOSE"": C L O S E -> but we have L, O, S.

But we don't know if L is in the word. Both are valid.

Another one: ""CYCLE"" has Y and C and L, but C is already known and Y is less common.

I think ""CHOSE"" is a good choice because it tests three new letters: H, O, S.

So, let's go with ""CHOSE"".

But note: the word must be a valid English word. ""CHOSE"" is the past tense of choose, so it is valid.

Therefore, our next guess: CHOSE.

We'll write it as: chose

But in the feedback, the first guess was in lowercase? The example was in uppercase, but the user input was ""crane"" in lowercase. So we'll use lowercase.

So, the guess is ""chose"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is not in the word (x).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is correct and in position 5 (✓).

The secret word must start with ""C"", end with ""E"", and cannot contain the letters R, A, or N. The middle three positions (2, 3, and 4) are unknown. For the next guess, I chose ""chose"" because:
- It starts with ""C"" and ends with ""E"", matching the known positions.
- It avoids the excluded letters (R, A, N).
- It tests three new common letters (H, O, S) in the middle positions to gather more information.

We know E is at the end, but it might appear again? The feedback doesn\'t say anything about duplicate letters, but the secret word might have duplicates. However, in this case, we have two E\'s? The first guess had E at the end and it was correct, but we don\'t know if there is another E.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed E as correct only at the end. If there were another E, it might have been indicated? Actually, the feedback per letter is independent. If the secret word has two E\'s, and we guess one E in the correct position and another E in a wrong position, it would show one ✓ and one - or x? But in this case, we only have one E in the guess (at the end) and it was correct. So we don\'t know if there are more E\'s.\n\nBut to be safe, we can avoid using E again in positions that are not the fifth? Actually, we can use E again to test if it appears elsewhere.\n\nBut for now, let\'s focus on new letters.\n\nWe have two positions to test: 2, 3, and 4. Actually three positions.\n\nWe can try a word that uses common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nLet me try to form a word: C _ _ _ E\n\nPossible words (without R, A, N):\n- CABLE: but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word).\n- CEDED: has E again, and D. But we don\'t know about D.\n- CHIDE: C H I D E -> H, I, D are new.\n- CHIME: C H I M E -> H, I, M are new.\n- CHOSE: C H O S E -> H, O, S are new.\n\nI think ""CHOSE"" is a good candidate because it uses H, O, S which are common.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid R, A, N. ""CHOSE"" does not contain these.\n\nAlternatively, ""CLOSE"": C L O S E -> but we have L, O, S.\n\nBut we don\'t know if L is in the word. Both are valid.\n\nAnother one: ""CYCLE"" has Y and C and L, but C is already known and Y is less common.\n\nI think ""CHOSE"" is a good choice because it tests three new letters: H, O, S.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""CHOSE"".\n\nBut note: the word must be a valid English word. ""CHOSE"" is the past tense of choose, so it is valid.\n\nTherefore, our next guess: CHOSE.\n\nWe\'ll write it as: chose\n\nBut in the feedback, the first guess was in lowercase? The example was in uppercase, but the user input was ""crane"" in lowercase. So we\'ll use lowercase.\n\nSo, the guess is ""chose"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- R is not in the word (x).\n- A is not in the word (x).\n- N is not in the word (x).\n- E is correct and in position 5 (✓).\n\nThe secret word must start with ""C"", end with ""E"", and cannot contain the letters R, A, or N. The middle three positions (2, 3, and 4) are unknown. For the next guess, I chose ""chose"" because:\n- It starts with ""C"" and ends with ""E"", matching the known positions.\n- It avoids the excluded letters (R, A, N).\n- It tests three new common letters (H, O, S) in the middle positions to gather more information.\n\n<guess>chose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: chose -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
This means:
- The first letter is C.
- The last letter is E.
- The letters R, A, and N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""chose"" -> C(✓) H(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
This means:
- The first letter is C (already known) and it's correct.
- The second letter H is not in the word (x).
- The third letter O is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So O is present, but not at position 3.
- The fourth letter S is not in the word (x).
- The fifth letter E is correct (already known).

So, from the feedback, we know:
- The word is of the form: C _ _ _ E
- The word contains the letter O, but not at position 3.
- The word does not contain: R, A, N, H, S.

Also, since O is in the word but not at position 3, it must be in position 2 or 4 (since position 1 is C and 5 is E). But position 4 is the fourth letter, and we have only two positions left: 2 and 4.

So, O must be in position 2 or 4.

Now, we need to think of a word that:
- Starts with C, ends with E.
- Contains O in either position 2 or 4.
- Does not contain R, A, N, H, S.

We also need to avoid using the letters that are already known to be absent.

Let's list the available letters: We have to avoid R, A, N, H, S. Also, we know the word has O and the letters we haven't tried yet.

We have positions 2, 3, and 4 to fill, but one of them is O (either 2 or 4). The other two positions must be filled with letters that are not in the exclusion list.

Exclusion list: R, A, N, H, S.

We can use: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that the word must contain O (somewhere in position 2 or 4).

We need to test which position O is in and also get information about the other letters.

We can try a word that has O in position 2 and then new letters in 3 and 4, or O in position 4 and new letters in 2 and 3.

But we don't know which one, so we might choose a word that forces O to be in one of the positions and tests other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put O in position 3 (since we know it's not there) and see if we can get more feedback.

Let me try to think of words that fit the pattern.

First, if O is in position 2, then the word is: C O _ _ E
We need to fill the third and fourth positions with letters not in the exclusion list and that form a valid word.

Possible words: 
- COGUE? Not a word.
- COMAE? Not common.
- COMET? But T is allowed, and M is allowed. COMET: C O M E T -> but the last letter is T, not E? We need the last letter to be E. So COMET ends with T, not E.
- COVET? Ends with T.
- We need words ending with E: 
  - COZIE? Not common.
  - CONGE? But N is excluded (from guess1: N is not in the word). So no.
  - COPSE? But S is excluded (from guess2: S is not in the word). So no.
  - CORGE? R and G? R is excluded.

This is difficult. Maybe O is not in position 2.

Now, if O is in position 4: then the word is: C _ _ O E
We need to fill the second and third positions.

Possible words:
- C L O P E? But P is allowed, but we have to end with E? C L O P E -> that's 5 letters? C, L, O, P, E -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:O? But we are assuming O at position 4? So the word would be C _ _ O E, so the third letter is not O, it's the fourth.

So, for example:
- C A V O E? But A is excluded.
- C U R O E? R excluded.
- C T O M E? But that would be C, T, O, M, E -> then O is at position 3, but we know O is not at position 3 (from feedback of ""chose"": O at position 3 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning it cannot be at position 3). So if we put O at position 3, it would be incorrect. But in this pattern, we are putting O at position 4.

So, valid words: 
- C L O V E? But that's C L O V E -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E -> but then O is at position 3, which is not allowed. We need O at position 4.

So, the word must have the fourth letter as O: so the third letter is something else.

Examples:
- C A B O E? A excluded.
- C U D O E? U and D: C U D O E -> but is that a word? Not really.
- C U R O E? R excluded.
- C O M B E? But that would be C O M B E -> O at position 2, not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be O: so the word is C ? ? O E.

Common words:
- CLONE? But L is allowed, but N is excluded (from guess1). So no.
- CRONE? R excluded.
- CHORE? H and R excluded.
- SCORE? S excluded and starts with S? No, we start with C.

Another one: C O Z E? Not 5 letters.

Perhaps: C A K E O? No, we need O at position 4 and E at 5.

I think of ""CANOE"" but N and A are excluded.

This is tricky. Maybe we need to consider that O might be in position 2? But earlier we had trouble.

Another idea: the word might have O in position 4, and the second and third letters are to be found.

For example: 
- ""CUTIE""? But that's C U T I E -> then O is not present? But we know O must be in the word. So no.

We must include O.

Let me list 5-letter words starting with C and ending with E, containing O, and without R, A, N, H, S.

Possible words (from English dictionary):
- COMET: but ends with T? No, ends with T.
- CONES: but N and S excluded, and ends with S? No.
- COPED: ends with D? No.
- CORED: R excluded and ends with D.
- COVED: ends with D.
- COWED: ends with D.
- COXED: ends with D.
- COYED: ends with D.

None of these end with E.

What about words with O in the middle and ending with E?
- GLOBE? Not starting with C.
- STORE? Not starting with C.

Starting with C and ending with E: 
- CHOKE: but H and K? H is excluded (from guess2: H is not in the word). Also, we have O at position 3? But we need to avoid H and S.
- CHOSE: we already tried, and S and H are out.
- CLOTE? Not a word.
- CLOVE: C L O V E -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E. But in this case, O is at position 3. However, from the feedback of ""chose"", we know that O is in the word but not at position 3. So if we try ""CLOVE"", then O is at position 3, which is the same as in ""chose"", and it was marked as wrong position for position 3, meaning that O cannot be at position 3. Therefore, ""CLOVE"" would have O at position 3, which is invalid.

So we cannot use O at position 3.

Therefore, O must be at position 2 or 4.

But we are struggling to find words with O at position 4 ending with E.

What about ""CACHE""? But A is excluded and no O.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""CYCLE""? C Y C L E -> but that has two C's? And no O. But we need O.

""COULE""? Not a word.

""BOCCE""? Not starting with C.

Perhaps we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication.

Another word: ""COMAE"" is not common, but let's see: C O M A E -> but A is excluded.

""COZIE"": C O Z I E -> that's a word (meaning cozy). It has O at position 2 and ends with E. And it doesn't contain R, A, N, H, S. So that's a possibility.

So, ""COZIE"": C(1), O(2), Z(3), I(4), E(5). But we have E at position 5, which is correct. And O is at position 2.

But we don't know if O is at position 2 or 4. If we guess ""COZIE"", then if O is actually at position 4, we will get feedback that O is not at position 2 (if it's not) and then we know it must be at 4.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has O at position 4.

For example: ""CABLE"" is out because of A.

""FOCUS"" not starting with C and S excluded.

""LOCUM"" not starting with C.

What about ""CUBE""? 4 letters.

""CRUDE"" R and U? R excluded.

""PRICE"" not starting with C.

I think ""COZIE"" is a valid option.

Another one: ""CHIDE"" but H is excluded.

""COVET"" ends with T.

""COWER"" ends with R and R excluded.

""COVER"" ends with R and R excluded.

""COMET"" ends with T.

So, ""COZIE"" seems to be a valid word that fits the constraints: starts with C, ends with E, has O at position 2, and uses new letters Z and I.

But we are not sure if O is at position 2 or 4. By guessing ""COZIE"", we can test:

- If the word has O at position 2, then we should get O as correct (✓) or at least present if not in the right position? But if it's in the word and at position 2, it should be ✓.

But if the secret word has O at position 4, then in ""COZIE"", O is at position 2, which is wrong, so it would be marked as (-) for present but wrong position, or (x) if not present? But we know O is present, so it would be (-) for position 2.

Similarly, if O is at position 2, then it would be (✓).

So by guessing ""COZIE"", we can determine the position of O.

Also, we test Z and I.

So let's go with ""COZIE"".

But is ""COZIE"" a valid Wordle word? Wordle uses a list of common words, and ""cozie"" is an accepted word (variant of cozy, and also a noun meaning a covering).

Alternatively, we can use ""COZEY"" or ""COZED"", but they don't end with E? ""COZEY"" is not standard.

Another word: ""DOZEN"" not starting with C.

""COVIN"" not ending with E.

I think ""COZIE"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there is a word with O at position 4.

For example, ""THROE"" not starting with C.

""SHOE"" not 5 letters.

"" C O _ _ E "" with O at 2: other words: 
- ""COMET"" not ending with E.
- ""CONGE"" has N and G, but N excluded.
- ""COPSE"" has S and P, but S excluded.

""COATE"" not a word.

""COBLE"" is a boat, but ends with E? C O B L E -> that's 5 letters. And it doesn't contain R,A,N,H,S. So ""COBLE"" is a possibility.

""COBLE"": C O B L E.

Similarly, ""COZIE"" and ""COBLE"" are options.

But ""COBLE"" has O at position 2 and B and L.

We can also consider ""CYCLE"", but no O.

Another one: ""COTTE"" has T and E, but O at position 2? C O T T E -> but T repeated, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But the secret word might have duplicates, but we haven't seen any yet.

But ""COTTE"" ends with E, and has O at 2, and avoids R,A,N,H,S.

But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, to test position 4 for O, we can try a word like ""PLACE"" but not starting with C? We have to start with C.

"" C _ _ O E "" : words like ""BURRO"" not ending with E.

""CHINO"" not ending with E.

I think it's easier to assume O is at position 2 for now and test.

But let's look for words with O at position 4.

For example: ""VOCES"" not starting with C and S excluded.

""FOCUS"" not starting with C.

""DOCLE"" not a word.

""TOCLE"" not a word.

"" C I V O E "" not a word.

"" C L E O ? "" not ending with E.

I think words with O at position 4 and ending with E are rare.

One common word: ""CANOE"" but A and N excluded.

Another: ""SHOJE"" not starting with C.

So perhaps O is more likely at position 2.

Therefore, I will go with ""COZIE"" to test.

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the secret word has O at position 2, then ""COZIE"" would have:
- C: ✓ (correct)
- O: ✓ (correct, if O is at position 2)
- Z: ? 
- I: ?
- E: ✓ (correct)

If the secret word has O at position 4, then in ""COZIE"":
- C: ✓
- O: this O is at position 2, but the actual O is at position 4, so it would be marked as present but wrong position (-)
- Z: ? 
- I: ? 
- E: ✓

And then we would know that O is at position 4.

Also, we get information about Z and I.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, I choose ""cozie"".

But let's see if there is a word that can test both possibilities? For example, a word that has O at position 4 and also tests other letters.

But we couldn't find one.

Another word: ""COUTE"" not common.

Or ""COUPE"" -> C O U P E. This is a valid word (a car or a dish). It has O at position 2 and U and P. And it ends with E.

And it avoids R,A,N,H,S.

So ""COUPE"" is another option.

Similarly, ""COUPE"": C O U P E.

We can use that.

But ""COUPE"" has O at position 2, same as ""COZIE"".

We can choose either.

I think ""COUPE"" is more common.

So let's go with ""COUPE"".

Guess: ""coupe""

But we need to make sure: in ""coupe"", the letters are C, O, U, P, E.

We haven't used U or P before, so we can test them.

If O is at position 2, then we might get O correct, and learn about U and P.

If O is not at position 2, then O will be marked as present but wrong position, and we know it must be at 4.

So it's good.

Therefore, I'll guess ""coupe"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)  
  This indicates that the secret word starts with ""C"", ends with ""E"", and does not contain R, A, or N.

- **Guess 2: ""chose""** → C(✓) H(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)  
  This confirms that ""C"" and ""E"" are in the correct positions (1st and 5th). ""H"" and ""S"" are not in the word. ""O"" is present but not in the 3rd position.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word pattern is: **C _ _ _ E**.
- ""O"" must be in the word but cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 2 or 4.
- Excluded letters: R, A, N, H, S (these cannot appear anywhere in the word).
- We need to test the position of ""O"" and gather information about the remaining unknown positions (2, 3, and 4) using new letters.

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Test ""O"" in position 2 (since position 3 is invalid and position 4 is less common for words ending in ""E"").
- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., U, P, L, M, T).
- Avoid excluded letters (R, A, N, H, S).

The word ""coupe"" fits well:
- Starts with ""C"" and ends with ""E"".
- Places ""O"" in position 2 to test if it belongs there.
- Uses new letters ""U"" and ""P"" (not previously tested).
- Avoids all excluded letters.

If ""O"" is in position 2, the feedback will show it as correct (✓). If not, it will be marked as present but wrong position (-), confirming ""O"" must be in position 4. We also get feedback on ""U"" and ""P"".

<guess>coupe</guess>",coupe,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
This means:
- The first letter is C.
- The last letter is E.
- The letters R, A, and N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""chose"" -> C(✓) H(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
This means:
- The first letter is C (already known) and it's correct.
- The second letter H is not in the word (x).
- The third letter O is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So O is present, but not at position 3.
- The fourth letter S is not in the word (x).
- The fifth letter E is correct (already known).

So, from the feedback, we know:
- The word is of the form: C _ _ _ E
- The word contains the letter O, but not at position 3.
- The word does not contain: R, A, N, H, S.

Also, since O is in the word but not at position 3, it must be in position 2 or 4 (since position 1 is C and 5 is E). But position 4 is the fourth letter, and we have only two positions left: 2 and 4.

So, O must be in position 2 or 4.

Now, we need to think of a word that:
- Starts with C, ends with E.
- Contains O in either position 2 or 4.
- Does not contain R, A, N, H, S.

We also need to avoid using the letters that are already known to be absent.

Let's list the available letters: We have to avoid R, A, N, H, S. Also, we know the word has O and the letters we haven't tried yet.

We have positions 2, 3, and 4 to fill, but one of them is O (either 2 or 4). The other two positions must be filled with letters that are not in the exclusion list.

Exclusion list: R, A, N, H, S.

We can use: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also know that the word must contain O (somewhere in position 2 or 4).

We need to test which position O is in and also get information about the other letters.

We can try a word that has O in position 2 and then new letters in 3 and 4, or O in position 4 and new letters in 2 and 3.

But we don't know which one, so we might choose a word that forces O to be in one of the positions and tests other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put O in position 3 (since we know it's not there) and see if we can get more feedback.

Let me try to think of words that fit the pattern.

First, if O is in position 2, then the word is: C O _ _ E
We need to fill the third and fourth positions with letters not in the exclusion list and that form a valid word.

Possible words: 
- COGUE? Not a word.
- COMAE? Not common.
- COMET? But T is allowed, and M is allowed. COMET: C O M E T -> but the last letter is T, not E? We need the last letter to be E. So COMET ends with T, not E.
- COVET? Ends with T.
- We need words ending with E: 
  - COZIE? Not common.
  - CONGE? But N is excluded (from guess1: N is not in the word). So no.
  - COPSE? But S is excluded (from guess2: S is not in the word). So no.
  - CORGE? R and G? R is excluded.

This is difficult. Maybe O is not in position 2.

Now, if O is in position 4: then the word is: C _ _ O E
We need to fill the second and third positions.

Possible words:
- C L O P E? But P is allowed, but we have to end with E? C L O P E -> that's 5 letters? C, L, O, P, E -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:O? But we are assuming O at position 4? So the word would be C _ _ O E, so the third letter is not O, it's the fourth.

So, for example:
- C A V O E? But A is excluded.
- C U R O E? R excluded.
- C T O M E? But that would be C, T, O, M, E -> then O is at position 3, but we know O is not at position 3 (from feedback of ""chose"": O at position 3 was marked as present but wrong position, meaning it cannot be at position 3). So if we put O at position 3, it would be incorrect. But in this pattern, we are putting O at position 4.

So, valid words: 
- C L O V E? But that's C L O V E -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E -> but then O is at position 3, which is not allowed. We need O at position 4.

So, the word must have the fourth letter as O: so the third letter is something else.

Examples:
- C A B O E? A excluded.
- C U D O E? U and D: C U D O E -> but is that a word? Not really.
- C U R O E? R excluded.
- C O M B E? But that would be C O M B E -> O at position 2, not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be O: so the word is C ? ? O E.

Common words:
- CLONE? But L is allowed, but N is excluded (from guess1). So no.
- CRONE? R excluded.
- CHORE? H and R excluded.
- SCORE? S excluded and starts with S? No, we start with C.

Another one: C O Z E? Not 5 letters.

Perhaps: C A K E O? No, we need O at position 4 and E at 5.

I think of ""CANOE"" but N and A are excluded.

This is tricky. Maybe we need to consider that O might be in position 2? But earlier we had trouble.

Another idea: the word might have O in position 4, and the second and third letters are to be found.

For example: 
- ""CUTIE""? But that's C U T I E -> then O is not present? But we know O must be in the word. So no.

We must include O.

Let me list 5-letter words starting with C and ending with E, containing O, and without R, A, N, H, S.

Possible words (from English dictionary):
- COMET: but ends with T? No, ends with T.
- CONES: but N and S excluded, and ends with S? No.
- COPED: ends with D? No.
- CORED: R excluded and ends with D.
- COVED: ends with D.
- COWED: ends with D.
- COXED: ends with D.
- COYED: ends with D.

None of these end with E.

What about words with O in the middle and ending with E?
- GLOBE? Not starting with C.
- STORE? Not starting with C.

Starting with C and ending with E: 
- CHOKE: but H and K? H is excluded (from guess2: H is not in the word). Also, we have O at position 3? But we need to avoid H and S.
- CHOSE: we already tried, and S and H are out.
- CLOTE? Not a word.
- CLOVE: C L O V E -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E. But in this case, O is at position 3. However, from the feedback of ""chose"", we know that O is in the word but not at position 3. So if we try ""CLOVE"", then O is at position 3, which is the same as in ""chose"", and it was marked as wrong position for position 3, meaning that O cannot be at position 3. Therefore, ""CLOVE"" would have O at position 3, which is invalid.

So we cannot use O at position 3.

Therefore, O must be at position 2 or 4.

But we are struggling to find words with O at position 4 ending with E.

What about ""CACHE""? But A is excluded and no O.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""CYCLE""? C Y C L E -> but that has two C's? And no O. But we need O.

""COULE""? Not a word.

""BOCCE""? Not starting with C.

Perhaps we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication.

Another word: ""COMAE"" is not common, but let's see: C O M A E -> but A is excluded.

""COZIE"": C O Z I E -> that's a word (meaning cozy). It has O at position 2 and ends with E. And it doesn't contain R, A, N, H, S. So that's a possibility.

So, ""COZIE"": C(1), O(2), Z(3), I(4), E(5). But we have E at position 5, which is correct. And O is at position 2.

But we don't know if O is at position 2 or 4. If we guess ""COZIE"", then if O is actually at position 4, we will get feedback that O is not at position 2 (if it's not) and then we know it must be at 4.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has O at position 4.

For example: ""CABLE"" is out because of A.

""FOCUS"" not starting with C and S excluded.

""LOCUM"" not starting with C.

What about ""CUBE""? 4 letters.

""CRUDE"" R and U? R excluded.

""PRICE"" not starting with C.

I think ""COZIE"" is a valid option.

Another one: ""CHIDE"" but H is excluded.

""COVET"" ends with T.

""COWER"" ends with R and R excluded.

""COVER"" ends with R and R excluded.

""COMET"" ends with T.

So, ""COZIE"" seems to be a valid word that fits the constraints: starts with C, ends with E, has O at position 2, and uses new letters Z and I.

But we are not sure if O is at position 2 or 4. By guessing ""COZIE"", we can test:

- If the word has O at position 2, then we should get O as correct (✓) or at least present if not in the right position? But if it's in the word and at position 2, it should be ✓.

But if the secret word has O at position 4, then in ""COZIE"", O is at position 2, which is wrong, so it would be marked as (-) for present but wrong position, or (x) if not present? But we know O is present, so it would be (-) for position 2.

Similarly, if O is at position 2, then it would be (✓).

So by guessing ""COZIE"", we can determine the position of O.

Also, we test Z and I.

So let's go with ""COZIE"".

But is ""COZIE"" a valid Wordle word? Wordle uses a list of common words, and ""cozie"" is an accepted word (variant of cozy, and also a noun meaning a covering).

Alternatively, we can use ""COZEY"" or ""COZED"", but they don't end with E? ""COZEY"" is not standard.

Another word: ""DOZEN"" not starting with C.

""COVIN"" not ending with E.

I think ""COZIE"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there is a word with O at position 4.

For example, ""THROE"" not starting with C.

""SHOE"" not 5 letters.

"" C O _ _ E "" with O at 2: other words: 
- ""COMET"" not ending with E.
- ""CONGE"" has N and G, but N excluded.
- ""COPSE"" has S and P, but S excluded.

""COATE"" not a word.

""COBLE"" is a boat, but ends with E? C O B L E -> that's 5 letters. And it doesn't contain R,A,N,H,S. So ""COBLE"" is a possibility.

""COBLE"": C O B L E.

Similarly, ""COZIE"" and ""COBLE"" are options.

But ""COBLE"" has O at position 2 and B and L.

We can also consider ""CYCLE"", but no O.

Another one: ""COTTE"" has T and E, but O at position 2? C O T T E -> but T repeated, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But the secret word might have duplicates, but we haven't seen any yet.

But ""COTTE"" ends with E, and has O at 2, and avoids R,A,N,H,S.

But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, to test position 4 for O, we can try a word like ""PLACE"" but not starting with C? We have to start with C.

"" C _ _ O E "" : words like ""BURRO"" not ending with E.

""CHINO"" not ending with E.

I think it's easier to assume O is at position 2 for now and test.

But let's look for words with O at position 4.

For example: ""VOCES"" not starting with C and S excluded.

""FOCUS"" not starting with C.

""DOCLE"" not a word.

""TOCLE"" not a word.

"" C I V O E "" not a word.

"" C L E O ? "" not ending with E.

I think words with O at position 4 and ending with E are rare.

One common word: ""CANOE"" but A and N excluded.

Another: ""SHOJE"" not starting with C.

So perhaps O is more likely at position 2.

Therefore, I will go with ""COZIE"" to test.

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the secret word has O at position 2, then ""COZIE"" would have:
- C: ✓ (correct)
- O: ✓ (correct, if O is at position 2)
- Z: ? 
- I: ?
- E: ✓ (correct)

If the secret word has O at position 4, then in ""COZIE"":
- C: ✓
- O: this O is at position 2, but the actual O is at position 4, so it would be marked as present but wrong position (-)
- Z: ? 
- I: ? 
- E: ✓

And then we would know that O is at position 4.

Also, we get information about Z and I.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, I choose ""cozie"".

But let's see if there is a word that can test both possibilities? For example, a word that has O at position 4 and also tests other letters.

But we couldn't find one.

Another word: ""COUTE"" not common.

Or ""COUPE"" -> C O U P E. This is a valid word (a car or a dish). It has O at position 2 and U and P. And it ends with E.

And it avoids R,A,N,H,S.

So ""COUPE"" is another option.

Similarly, ""COUPE"": C O U P E.

We can use that.

But ""COUPE"" has O at position 2, same as ""COZIE"".

We can choose either.

I think ""COUPE"" is more common.

So let's go with ""COUPE"".

Guess: ""coupe""

But we need to make sure: in ""coupe"", the letters are C, O, U, P, E.

We haven't used U or P before, so we can test them.

If O is at position 2, then we might get O correct, and learn about U and P.

If O is not at position 2, then O will be marked as present but wrong position, and we know it must be at 4.

So it's good.

Therefore, I'll guess ""coupe"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)  
  This indicates that the secret word starts with ""C"", ends with ""E"", and does not contain R, A, or N.

- **Guess 2: ""chose""** → C(✓) H(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)  
  This confirms that ""C"" and ""E"" are in the correct positions (1st and 5th). ""H"" and ""S"" are not in the word. ""O"" is present but not in the 3rd position.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word pattern is: **C _ _ _ E**.
- ""O"" must be in the word but cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 2 or 4.
- Excluded letters: R, A, N, H, S (these cannot appear anywhere in the word).
- We need to test the position of ""O"" and gather information about the remaining unknown positions (2, 3, and 4) using new letters.

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Test ""O"" in position 2 (since position 3 is invalid and position 4 is less common for words ending in ""E"").
- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., U, P, L, M, T).
- Avoid excluded letters (R, A, N, H, S).

The word ""coupe"" fits well:
- Starts with ""C"" and ends with ""E"".
- Places ""O"" in position 2 to test if it belongs there.
- Uses new letters ""U"" and ""P"" (not previously tested).
- Avoids all excluded letters.

If ""O"" is in position 2, the feedback will show it as correct (✓). If not, it will be marked as present but wrong position (-), confirming ""O"" must be in position 4. We also get feedback on ""U"" and ""P"".",Guess 3: coupe -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) U(✓) P(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
