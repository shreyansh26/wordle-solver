We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(x), A(✓), N(-), E(-)
 This means:
   - C is in the word but not in the first position (since it's marked with - and was in position 1).
   - R is not in the word at all (x).
   - A is in the word and in the correct position (✓). Since A was the third letter in ""crane"", the third letter of the secret word is A.
   - N is in the word but not in the fourth position (since it was in position 4 and marked -).
   - E is in the word but not in the fifth position (since it was in position 5 and marked -).

 So, we know:
   - The secret word has the letter A in the third position: _ _ A _ _
   - The secret word contains the letters C, N, and E (but not R, so we avoid R).
   - C is not in position 1, N is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

 Also, note that the word does not contain R.

 Since we have three letters that are in the word (C, N, E) and one that is not (R), and we know A is fixed at position 3.

 We need to make a second guess that:
   - Is a 5-letter English word.
   - Has A in the third position.
   - Includes the letters C, N, E (but note: they might be repeated? but we don't have evidence of repetition yet) but avoid R.
   - Avoids placing C in position 1, N in position 4, E in position 5.

 However, note that the feedback does not necessarily mean that C, N, E appear only once. But since we don't have any duplicate letters in ""crane"", we assume for now that they are single.

 We also have to consider that the word might have other letters we haven't tried.

 Let's think of words that have A in the third position and contain C, N, E.

 But note: the feedback for C, N, E is that they are present but in the wrong positions. So they must appear in the word in positions other than 1, 4, and 5 respectively.

 However, we must also consider that the word might have 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we don't have information about duplicates.

 Since we have three letters to place (C, N, E) and two more letters to discover (because the word has 5 letters and we know A is fixed at position 3, and we have three more known letters: C, N, E, but wait: that would be 4 letters? Actually, the word must have at least these 4: A, C, N, E, and one more).

 Actually, the secret word must contain: A (at position 3), C, N, E, and one more letter (since R is excluded). But note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that the word contains C, A, N, E (and not R). So the word has at least these four, and one more.

 We have to account for the positions:

   Position 1: cannot be C (because feedback for C was - meaning it's in the word but not in position 1). Also, it cannot be R (excluded) and cannot be A (because A is at position 3) or N or E? Not necessarily, but we know A is at 3 so position 1 can be N or E? But wait: we have constraints for N and E too.

   Position 2: can be any letter except R and except the ones we know are fixed? But we don't know.

   Position 3: A (fixed).

   Position 4: cannot be N (because in ""crane"" N was at position 4 and got -).

   Position 5: cannot be E (because in ""crane"" E was at position 5 and got -).

 So, we need to form a word that:

   [1] not C, not R, and not A (since A is at 3) and not N? Not necessarily, but if we put N at position 1, that's allowed because the feedback only said N is not at position 4. Similarly, E can be at position 1 or 2 or 4? But not 5.

   However, we must also include the letters C, N, E in the word in positions that are not forbidden for them.

 Let me try to list possible words.

 We know the word has the form: _ _ A _ _

 And the word must contain C, N, E.

 We also know that the word does not contain R.

 Let's think of words that have A in the middle and contain C, N, E.

 Example: ""dance"" -> but let's check:
   d a n c e -> but wait, the third letter is 'n', not 'a'. So that doesn't work.

 We need the third letter to be A.

 Another example: ""place"" -> p l a c e
   But note: we have to check the constraints for the known letters:
     - C is in ""place"" at position 4 -> but in our feedback, C was in the word but not at position 1. In ""place"", C is at 4, which is allowed (since the constraint is only that it cannot be at 1). 
     - However, we also have N to include. ""place"" does not have N.

 So ""place"" is missing N.

 Another example: ""lance"" -> l a n c e -> but third letter is 'n', not 'a'. So no.

 We need the third letter to be A. So the word must be: ? ? A ? ?

 And it must contain C, N, E.

 Let me try: ""camel"" -> c a m e l -> third letter is 'm', not 'a'. No.

 How about ""scare""? s c a r e -> but we cannot have R. So no.

 How about ""scene""? s c e n e -> third letter is 'e', not 'a'. No.

 How about ""caned""? c a n e d -> third letter is 'n', not 'a'. No.

 We need to have A at position 3. So let me think of words that have the pattern: __A__ and contain C, N, E.

 Example: ""chase"" -> c h a s e -> but does it have N? No.

 How about ""crane"" again? But we already tried that.

 We need a word that has C, N, E and A at position 3, and without R.

 How about ""caked""? c a k e d -> third letter is 'k', not 'a'. No.

 I think I'm having trouble. Let me try to list words that have A at position 3.

 Some words: 
   place -> but no N
   trace -> has R (forbidden)
   plane -> p l a n e -> this has A at position 3? Let's see: 
        position 1: p, 2: l, 3: a, 4: n, 5: e.

   Now, check the constraints:
     - C: is it in the word? ""plane"" has p, l, a, n, e -> no C. So we cannot use it because we must include C.

 How about ""clane""? That's not a word.

 Another idea: ""dance"" is not because A is not at 3.

 How about ""cabin""? c a b i n -> third letter is 'b', not 'a'. No.

 How about ""cacti""? c a c t i -> third letter is 'c', not 'a'. No.

 How about ""mane""? That's 4 letters.

 We need 5 letters.

 How about ""camel""? c a m e l -> third letter is 'm', not 'a'. 

 I think I need to look for words that have the pattern: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5] and that contain C, N, E.

 But note: the word must contain C, N, E. So the letters must include C, N, E and A, and one more.

 The positions for C, N, E cannot be:
   C: not position 1 (but can be 2,4,5? but wait, position 5 is forbidden for E? and position 4 for N? and we have to avoid R).

 Also, we cannot put N at position 4 and E at position 5.

 So possible placements:

   For C: can be in position 2,4,5? but position 5 is also forbidden for E? Actually, the constraints are independent. But note: we have to avoid the positions where they were in the first guess if they got a minus? The minus means they are in the word but not in that position. So for C, it cannot be in position 1. For N, it cannot be in position 4. For E, it cannot be in position 5.

 So:

   C: positions 2,4,5 (but note: if we put C in position 5, that's allowed because the constraint for E is only that E cannot be in position 5, but C can be there).

   N: positions 1,2,5 (cannot be 4)

   E: positions 1,2,4 (cannot be 5)

 And the word must have A at position 3.

 Now, we also have to fill the other two positions? Actually, we have five positions and we know one (A at 3). We have to assign C, N, E to three of the remaining four positions? But wait, we have four positions (1,2,4,5) and three letters (C, N, E) and one more letter (let's call it X) that we don't know.

 So the word has: [1,2,4,5] = {C, N, E, X} and position 3 = A.

 We don't know X, but we know it cannot be R and cannot be any of the letters that are already known? Not necessarily, but we don't have information.

 However, we must choose a word that is valid.

 Let me try to think of words that have A at position 3 and that contain C, N, E.

 Example: ""ocean"" -> o c e a n -> but wait, the third letter is 'e', not 'a'. So no.

 How about ""acned""? a c n e d -> but the third letter is 'n', not 'a'. No.

 How about ""since""? s i n c e -> third letter is 'n', not 'a'. No.

 How about ""cane""? 4 letters.

 How about ""caned""? c a n e d -> third letter is 'n', not 'a'. 

 I'm struggling. Let me try a different approach: use a word that has A at position 3 and includes C, N, E, but also we can use the same letter twice? The feedback didn't indicate any duplicate, but we don't know.

 Another idea: ""dance"" is not. What about ""enact""? e n a c t -> 
   position 3 is 'a'. 
   It has E, N, A, C, T. So it has C, N, E? Yes: E at 1, N at 2, A at 3, C at 4, T at 5.

 Now, check constraints:
   - C: in the word at position 4 -> allowed (since constraint is not position 1). 
   - N: in the word at position 2 -> allowed (constraint is not position 4).
   - E: in the word at position 1 -> allowed (constraint is not position 5).

 Also, no R.

 So ""enact"" is a candidate.

 But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and the feedback for C was that it is in the word but not at position 1. In ""enact"", C is at position 4, which is fine.

 However, we must also note that the feedback for A was that it is correct and at position 3, which matches.

 But wait: in ""enact"", the letter A is at position 3, so that's good.

 Now, what about the other letters? We don't have any constraints for T.

 So let's consider ""enact"" as a guess.

 But note: we are not required to use all the known letters? Actually, we must because the feedback told us that C, N, E are in the word. So we have to include them.

 However, in ""enact"", we have:
   E at 1, N at 2, A at 3, C at 4, T at 5.

 So it includes C, N, E and A.

 And the unknown letter T is not R.

 So it's a valid guess.

 But is there a better word? We could also try ""anode"" but that has A at position 1, not 3.

 Another candidate: ""ounce"" -> o u n c e -> third letter is 'n', not 'a'. 

 How about ""peace""? p e a c e -> 
   It has A at 3, and has C and E, but no N. So we cannot use it.

 How about ""nacre""? n a c r e -> has R? Yes, so forbidden.

 How about ""lance""? l a n c e -> third letter is 'n', not 'a'. 

 So ""enact"" seems a good candidate.

 But note: we have to be cautious because the feedback from the first guess also told us that N is in the word but not at position 4. In ""enact"", N is at position 2, which is allowed.

 Similarly, E is at position 1 (allowed, since not 5) and C is at position 4 (allowed, since not 1).

 Therefore, I will guess ""enact"".

 However, let me double-check: is ""enact"" a valid English word? Yes, it means to perform or represent.

 So, second guess: ""enact""

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

 But note: we are only to return the guessed word.

 Format: <guess>enact</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked with -).
- R is not in the word (marked with x).
- A is in the word and correctly placed in position 3 (marked with ✓).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (marked with -).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with -).

The secret word must:
- Have A in position 3 (format: _ _ A _ _).
- Contain C, N, and E (but not R).
- Avoid placing C in position 1, N in position 4, and E in position 5.

For the second guess, I chose ""enact"" because:
- It has A in position 3 (e n **a** c t).
- It includes C (position 4), N (position 2), and E (position 1), satisfying their presence.
- It adheres to position constraints: 
  - C is not in position 1 (it's in 4).
  - N is not in position 4 (it's in 2).
  - E is not in position 5 (it's in 1).
- It avoids R and is a valid English word.

 So the word has: [1,2,4,5] = {C, N, E, X} and position 3 = A.

 We don't know X, but we know it cannot be R and cannot be any of the letters that are already known? Not necessarily, but we don't have information.

 However, we must choose a word that is valid.

 Let me try to think of words that have A at position 3 and that contain C, N, E.

 Example: ""ocean"" -> o c e a n -> but wait, the third letter is 'e', not 'a'. So no.

 How about ""acned""? a c n e d -> but the third letter is 'n', not 'a'. No.

 How about ""since""? s i n c e -> third letter is 'n', not 'a'. No.

 How about ""cane""? 4 letters.

 How about ""caned""? c a n e d -> third letter is 'n', not 'a'. 

 I'm struggling. Let me try a different approach: use a word that has A at position 3 and includes C, N, E, but also we can use the same letter twice? The feedback didn't indicate any duplicate, but we don't know.

 Another idea: ""dance"" is not. What about ""enact""? e n a c t -> 
   position 3 is 'a'. 
   It has E, N, A, C, T. So it has C, N, E? Yes: E at 1, N at 2, A at 3, C at 4, T at 5.

 Now, check constraints:
   - C: in the word at position 4 -> allowed (since constraint is not position 1). 
   - N: in the word at position 2 -> allowed (constraint is not position 4).
   - E: in the word at position 1 -> allowed (constraint is not position 5).

 Also, no R.

 So ""enact"" is a candidate.

 But note: in the first guess, we had ""crane"" and the feedback for C was that it is in the word but not at position 1. In ""enact"", C is at position 4, which is fine.

 However, we must also note that the feedback for A was that it is correct and at position 3, which matches.

 But wait: in ""enact"", the letter A is at position 3, so that's good.

 Now, what about the other letters? We don't have any constraints for T.

 So let's consider ""enact"" as a guess.

 But note: we are not required to use all the known letters? Actually, we must because the feedback told us that C, N, E are in the word. So we have to include them.

 However, in ""enact"", we have:
   E at 1, N at 2, A at 3, C at 4, T at 5.

 So it includes C, N, E and A.

 And the unknown letter T is not R.

 So it's a valid guess.

 But is there a better word? We could also try ""anode"" but that has A at position 1, not 3.

 Another candidate: ""ounce"" -> o u n c e -> third letter is 'n', not 'a'. 

 How about ""peace""? p e a c e -> 
   It has A at 3, and has C and E, but no N. So we cannot use it.

 How about ""nacre""? n a c r e -> has R? Yes, so forbidden.

 How about ""lance""? l a n c e -> third letter is 'n', not 'a'. 

 So ""enact"" seems a good candidate.

 But note: we have to be cautious because the feedback from the first guess also told us that N is in the word but not at position 4. In ""enact"", N is at position 2, which is allowed.

 Similarly, E is at position 1 (allowed, since not 5) and C is at position 4 (allowed, since not 1).

 Therefore, I will guess ""enact"".

 However, let me double-check: is ""enact"" a valid English word? Yes, it means to perform or represent.

 So, second guess: ""enact""

 We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

 But note: we are only to return the guessed word.

 Format: <guess>enact</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked with -).
- R is not in the word (marked with x).
- A is in the word and correctly placed in position 3 (marked with ✓).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (marked with -).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (marked with -).

The secret word must:
- Have A in position 3 (format: _ _ A _ _).
- Contain C, N, and E (but not R).
- Avoid placing C in position 1, N in position 4, and E in position 5.

For the second guess, I chose ""enact"" because:
- It has A in position 3 (e n **a** c t).
- It includes C (position 4), N (position 2), and E (position 1), satisfying their presence.
- It adheres to position constraints: 
  - C is not in position 1 (it's in 4).
  - N is not in position 4 (it's in 2).
  - E is not in position 5 (it's in 1).
- It avoids R and is a valid English word.",Guess 2: enact -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(✓) A(✓) C(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
