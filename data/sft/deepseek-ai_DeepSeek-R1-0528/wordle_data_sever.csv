We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 
 - C and R are common consonants.
 - A and E are common vowels.
 - N is also a common consonant.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 2 and 5 respectively in ""crane"").
- Letters C, A, N are absent.

We have 6 tries total, and this is the second guess.

Now, we need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Doesn't include C, A, N (since they are marked as not in the word)
- Includes R and E (since they are present, but not in the same positions as in ""crane"")
- We must also consider that R and E are in the word but not in the positions we guessed.

In the first guess:
- R was in position 2 (second letter) but is actually in a different position in the secret word.
- E was in position 5 (last letter) but is actually in a different position.

For the second guess, we should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 is wrong and not 5? Actually, it could be in 5 too, because the feedback only says wrong position, not that it can't be in 5. But note: the feedback for R says ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, position 5 is available because it was not tried for R. However, E was in position 5 and we know E is present but not in position 5? No: wait, the feedback for E says it is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1,2,3,4? And similarly, R can be in positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, positions 1,3,4 are common for both? Let me clarify:

The secret word has letters: R and E (and three others) and excludes C, A, N.

We must avoid:
- Using C, A, N anywhere.
- Placing R in position 2 (since that was wrong).
- Placing E in position 5 (since that was wrong).

We also don't know the other letters. We need to choose a word that includes R and E, and avoids C,A,N.

Common letters: Let's try to pick a word that includes other common letters like T, O, I, L, S, etc.

Since R is present, we can try words that start with R? Or have R in another spot.

Also, note that the secret word doesn't have A, so words with A should be avoided.

Let me think of words that include R and E, and without C,A,N.

Possible candidates:

1. Words starting with R: But we don't know if R is first. But we can try? However, we should avoid having R in position 2? Actually, for our next guess, we can put R anywhere except position 2? Or we could? Actually, we can put R anywhere we have not yet ruled out. The feedback tells us only that position 2 is incorrect for R. So R could be in 1,3,4,5? But note: we also have E that must be placed not in position 5.

But wait: the secret word has E somewhere else? So in our next guess, we don't want to put E in position 5 again? Actually, we are allowed, but it might give redundant information? So we should avoid placing E in position 5 because we already know it's not there? Similarly, we should avoid placing R in position 2.

So for our second guess, let's avoid:
- Putting R in position 2
- Putting E in position 5

Also, the word must not contain C, A, N.

We have to guess a word that includes R and E? Actually, not necessarily? Wait no, we know R and E are in the word? Actually, from the feedback, R and E are present? So yes, they must be in the word? Therefore, every subsequent guess must include R and E? But we don't know how many times? So we assume they appear at least once.

Now, we also don't know any other letters.

We can try a word that uses other common letters? Like T, O, I, L, S.

Possible words:

Consider: ""ROTATE"" -> too long? We need 5 letters. And it has A? Which is ruled out? Also has T? But A is excluded? So no A allowed? So ""ROTATE"" has A? So not allowed.

Other words:

- ""STORE"": 
  - S, T, O, R, E.
  - Does it include R? Yes. E? Yes.
  - Avoids C, A, N? Yes.
  - Position: 
    - R is placed in position 4? And we are avoiding position 2? We are not placing R in position 2? Here R is in 4? That's new.
    - E is placed in position 5? But we must avoid? Because E is in position 5? But feedback on E said E(-) meaning it's present but not in position 5? So putting E in position 5 is not allowed? Actually, we can put it? But we already know that position 5 is wrong? So if we put it there, we expect a ""-"" if E is still in the word? But we know it is? So we might get a ""-"" again? Alternatively, we might get a ""x"" if the secret word had two E's and we haven't tried E in other positions? Actually, no: we know there's at least one E? But we should put E in a different position to try to find its correct spot? Therefore, we should avoid position 5? So let's not put E in position 5.

So avoid:
- Letters: C, A, N
- Position 2: R?
- Position 5: E?

Alternatively, we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4? And then we avoid R in position 2? Position 2 can be any letter? Actually, position 2 can be any letter? But R cannot be there? Only that R was in position 2 last time? So we can put E in position 2? Yes, because last time E was not in position 5? But we haven't tested position 2 for E? So yes, we can put E in position 2? But we know that R was in position 2? But R was taken as absent? Actually, no: R is present? But we put R in position 2? But the feedback said it's in the word but not in position 2? So we think R is not in position 2? And E? We don't know? Maybe E is in position 2? We don't know? It could be? So let's try to put E in a position we haven't tried? Currently, we tried E only in position 5? So positions 1,2,3,4? We can try one? Similarly, R: we tried in position 2? So we can try R in 1,3,4,5? But note: position 5? We also tried E in 5? So R can be in 5? Because E was tried in 5? So we can try.

But we might want to test different letters? We haven't tried? Also, we don't know if there might be other letters? So let's choose a word that uses new common letters? Such as T, O, I, L, S.

Possible words:

- ""tires"": T, I, R, E, S -> no C,A,N? Yes. E is in position 4? Not 5. R is in position 3? Not 2? So good! But wait: positions?
  - T in 1st
  - I in 2nd -> we don't know? We don't have info? But we haven't ruled out? 
  - R in 3rd: not 2nd? Previously R was in 2nd? So now we are trying R in 3rd? Which is new.
  - E in 4th? Previously E was in 5th? Now we are trying E in 4th? Which is new.

Alternative: ""robes""? But it has B? Maybe? Also, E in position 5? We wanted to avoid? 
- robes: R, O, B, E, S -> E in position 5? Avoid? So better avoid position 5 for E? 

So ""tires"" seems good? But let me see: what common letters we cover? 
It includes T, I, R, E, S? That's 5 distinct letters? And we exclude C,A,N? Also, we are testing S? Which is common? 

Another option: ""stern"": 
S, T, E, R, N -> but N is excluded? We can't because N was marked as absent? So ""tires"" doesn't have N? Good? 

Also, ""slope"": S, L, O, P, E? But it doesn't include R? We know R must be in the word? Why? Because R was marked as present? And we haven't found the word? So we must include R? Otherwise, we might not get information? However, if we don't include R, then if the new guess has no R and we get feedback that shows R is there? Actually, the feedback will tell us? But we are trying to guess quickly? And we know R is in? So we must include R? Similarly E?

Therefore, in the second guess, we must include both R and E? Yes? Because we know they are present? And also avoid C,A,N? 

We can try ""tries"": T, R, I, E, S? 
This word has R in position 2? But wait: we must avoid putting R in position 2? Because last time R was in position 2? And the feedback said it's present but not in that position? Therefore, putting R in position 2 again? Then the feedback would say ""-"" again? And we learned nothing new? So that wastes a slot? So we should avoid putting R in position 2? Similarly, avoid E in position 5? 

So ""tries"": Positions? 
1: T? 
2: R? -> but we are putting R in position 2? Which we already know is wrong? We expect a ""-"" again? 
3: I? 
4: E? 
5: S? 

We are avoiding E in position 5? But here E is in position 4? So that's okay? But R is in position 2? Which we shouldn't? Actually, we have to avoid position 2 for R? So we cannot use ""tries"" because we are repeating a known wrong position? We want to rule out new positions? So we avoid?

Therefore, ""tires"": 
1: T? 
2: I? 
3: R? -> not in position 2? So new position? 
4: E? -> not in position 5? So new position? 
5: S? 

So that's good? 

Alternatively, ""resit"": 
1: R? 
2: E? -> but we haven't tested position 2? We know R was wrong in 2? But E? We haven't tested E in 2? So we can? But is it a real word? I think RESIT is valid? 

But let me think: We know R is present? Putting R in position 1? We don't know if that's correct? Similarly? 

But we have two positions: R can be in 1,3,4,5? And E in 1,2,3,4? 

If we put R in 1? Then we might get ✓? Or -? Or x if by mistake? But we know R is in? So ✓ or -? 

Similarly, for E? 

In ""resit"": 
R in 1? 
E in 2? 
S in 3? 
I in 4? 
T in 5? 

We avoid: 
- Letters: C,A,N? Yes? 
- R not in 2? Yes? 
- E not in 5? Yes? 

So we are testing R in position 1 and E in position 2? Both new? 

But which one is better? 
We get to test two new positions? 

Alternatively, ""store"": 
S, T, O, R, E -> 
R in position 4? 
E in position 5? But we avoid E in position 5? So that doesn't help? Therefore, we skip.

So between ""tires"" and ""resit""? Both are valid?

Another candidate: ""arise""? But has A? Ruled out? Not allowed.

""opera""? Has O,P,E,R,A? A? Excluded? So not allowed.

""house"": H,O,U,S,E? Doesn't have R? So we don't include R? Then the feedback for R? We know R is in the word? So if we don't include R? We get a problem? The feedback will tell us that R is still missing? Meaning? For each letter? So if we don't include R? Then the position where we don't have R? But for letters? We get feedback for each letter? Specifically? For ""house"", 
H: new? 
O: new? 
U: new? 
S: new? 
E: and E? We know E? But position? E is in position 5? Which we already tested? And was wrong? So we put E again in 5? So we expect ""-"" for E? Because in wrong position? Because we know E is in the word but position 5 is wrong? So we expect ""-""? 
And R? We didn't include? So the feedback would say:
- For H: could be ✓, - , or x? 
Similarly for O,U,S? 
Then for E: might be ""-"" again? 
But we didn't test R? So what? We know R is present? So we need to include R? Otherwise, we won't get information about R's position? 

Therefore, we must include R? And E? Because they are confirmed? 

So words without R? Are wasted? Similarly without E? 

Therefore, we stick to including both? 

So let me choose: 
I am thinking of ""resit""? Which has R and E? 

But note: the word might have double letters? We don't know? 

But for now? 

Actually, ""tires"" is the same letters as ""tries""? But in different order? Without repeating known wrong positions? 

Summary of candidates:

1. ""tires"": 
   - T, I, R, E, S 
   - R in pos 3 (new) 
   - E in pos 4 (new) 

2. ""resit"": 
   - R in pos 1 (new) 
   - E in pos 2 (new) 

Which one is better? 

I am inclined to ""tires""? Because position 1 has T? Which is a common letter? And position 2 has I? Which is common vowel? But also ""resit"" has R as first? which is less common? Actually, many words start with T? 

Another candidate: ""stern"": but has N? Not allowed? 

""brize""? Not a common word? 

So I'll go with ""tires"". 

It avoids C,A,N and puts R and E in new positions? 

Also, letters T, I, S? Are new? Common? 

So let's guess ""tires"". 

But wait: we haven't tried position 1? Position 2? etc? 

Also, if the secret word has I? Then we might find? 

I think it's a good guess? 

Therefore, second guess: <guess>tires</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x""), so they must be avoided.
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked with ""-"").
- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include both R and E (as they are confirmed present) but place R anywhere except position 2 and E anywhere except position 5.
- Avoid C, A, and N entirely.
- Introduce new common letters (like T, I, S) to test additional potential positions.

A strong choice is **""tires""** because:
- It contains R (placed in position 3, a new untested position) and E (placed in position 4, avoiding position 5).
- It avoids C, A, and N.
- It introduces new common letters: T in position 1, I in position 2, and S in position 5 (all not tested before).

This strategically maximizes information gain by testing R and E in new positions while covering new high-frequency letters.

<guess>tires</guess>",tires,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 2 and 5 respectively in ""crane"").
- Letters C, A, N are absent.

We have 6 tries total, and this is the second guess.

Now, we need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Doesn't include C, A, N (since they are marked as not in the word)
- Includes R and E (since they are present, but not in the same positions as in ""crane"")
- We must also consider that R and E are in the word but not in the positions we guessed.

In the first guess:
- R was in position 2 (second letter) but is actually in a different position in the secret word.
- E was in position 5 (last letter) but is actually in a different position.

For the second guess, we should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 is wrong and not 5? Actually, it could be in 5 too, because the feedback only says wrong position, not that it can't be in 5. But note: the feedback for R says ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, position 5 is available because it was not tried for R. However, E was in position 5 and we know E is present but not in position 5? No: wait, the feedback for E says it is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1,2,3,4? And similarly, R can be in positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, positions 1,3,4 are common for both? Let me clarify:

The secret word has letters: R and E (and three others) and excludes C, A, N.

We must avoid:
- Using C, A, N anywhere.
- Placing R in position 2 (since that was wrong).
- Placing E in position 5 (since that was wrong).

So we should avoid placing E in position 5 because we already know it's not there? Similarly, we should avoid placing R in position 2.

So for our second guess, let's avoid:

  - S, T, O, R, E.
  - Does it include R? Yes. E? Yes.
  - Avoids C, A, N? Yes.

    - R is placed in position 4? And we are avoiding position 2? We are not placing R in position 2? Here R is in 4? That's new.

Only that R was in position 2 last time? So we can put E in position 2? Yes, because last time E was not in position 5? But we haven't tested position 2 for E? So yes, we can put E in position 2?

So we think R is not in position 2? And E? We don't know? Maybe E is in position 2? We don't know? It could be? So let's try to put E in a position we haven't tried? Currently, we tried E only in position 5? So positions 1,2,3,4? We can try one? Similarly, R: we tried in position 2? So we can try R in 1,3,4,5? But note: position 5? We also tried E in 5? So R can be in 5? Because E was tried in 5? So we can try.

But we might want to test different letters? We haven't tried? Also, we don't know if there might be other letters? So let's choose a word that uses new common letters? Such as T, O, I, L, S.

Possible words:

- ""tires"": T, I, R, E, S -> no C,A,N? Yes. E is in position 4? Not 5. R is in position 3? Not 2? So good! But wait: positions?
  - T in 1st
  - I in 2nd -> we don't know? We don't have info? But we haven't ruled out? 
  - R in 3rd: not 2nd? Previously R was in 2nd? So now we are trying R in 3rd? Which is new.
  - E in 4th? Previously E was in 5th? Now we are trying E in 4th? Which is new.

Alternative: ""robes""? But it has B? Maybe? Also, E in position 5? We wanted to avoid? 
- robes: R, O, B, E, S -> E in position 5? Avoid? So better avoid position 5 for E? 

So ""tires"" seems good? But let me see: what common letters we cover? 
It includes T, I, R, E, S? That's 5 distinct letters? And we exclude C,A,N? Also, we are testing S? Which is common? 

Another option: ""stern"": 
S, T, E, R, N -> but N is excluded? We can't because N was marked as absent? So ""tires"" doesn't have N? Good? 

Also, ""slope"": S, L, O, P, E? But it doesn't include R? We know R must be in the word? Why? Because R was marked as present? And we haven't found the word? So we must include R? Otherwise, we might not get information? However, if we don't include R, then if the new guess has no R and we get feedback that shows R is there? Actually, the feedback will tell us? But we are trying to guess quickly? And we know R is in? So we must include R? Similarly E?

Therefore, in the second guess, we must include both R and E? Yes? Because we know they are present? And also avoid C,A,N? 

We can try ""tries"": T, R, I, E, S? 
This word has R in position 2? But wait: we must avoid putting R in position 2? Because last time R was in position 2? And the feedback said it's present but not in that position? Therefore, putting R in position 2 again? Then the feedback would say ""-"" again? And we learned nothing new? So that wastes a slot? So we should avoid putting R in position 2? Similarly, avoid E in position 5? 

So ""tries"": Positions? 
1: T? 
2: R? -> but we are putting R in position 2? Which we already know is wrong? We expect a ""-"" again? 
3: I? 
4: E? 
5: S? 

We are avoiding E in position 5? But here E is in position 4? So that's okay? But R is in position 2? Which we shouldn't? Actually, we have to avoid position 2 for R? So we cannot use ""tries"" because we are repeating a known wrong position? We want to rule out new positions? So we avoid?

Therefore, ""tires"": 
1: T? 
2: I? 
3: R? -> not in position 2? So new position? 
4: E? -> not in position 5? So new position? 
5: S? 

So that's good? 

Alternatively, ""resit"": 
1: R? 
2: E? -> but we haven't tested position 2? We know R was wrong in 2? But E? We haven't tested E in 2? So we can? But is it a real word? I think RESIT is valid? 

But let me think: We know R is present? Putting R in position 1? We don't know if that's correct? Similarly? 

But we have two positions: R can be in 1,3,4,5? And E in 1,2,3,4? 

If we put R in 1? Then we might get ✓? Or -? Or x if by mistake? But we know R is in? So ✓ or -? 

Similarly, for E? 

In ""resit"": 
R in 1? 
E in 2? 
S in 3? 
I in 4? 
T in 5? 

We avoid: 
- Letters: C,A,N? Yes? 
- R not in 2? Yes? 
- E not in 5? Yes? 

So we are testing R in position 1 and E in position 2? Both new? 

But which one is better? 
We get to test two new positions? 

Alternatively, ""store"": 
S, T, O, R, E -> 
R in position 4? 
E in position 5? But we avoid E in position 5? So that doesn't help? Therefore, we skip.

So between ""tires"" and ""resit""? Both are valid?

Another candidate: ""arise""? But has A? Ruled out? Not allowed.

""opera""? Has O,P,E,R,A? A? Excluded? So not allowed.

""house"": H,O,U,S,E? Doesn't have R? So we don't include R? Then the feedback for R? We know R is in the word? So if we don't include R? We get a problem? The feedback will tell us that R is still missing? Meaning? For each letter? So if we don't include R? Then the position where we don't have R? But for letters? We get feedback for each letter? Specifically? For ""house"", 
H: new? 
O: new? 
U: new? 
S: new? 
E: and E? We know E? But position? E is in position 5? Which we already tested? And was wrong? So we put E again in 5? So we expect ""-"" for E? Because in wrong position? Because we know E is in the word but position 5 is wrong? So we expect ""-""? 
And R? We didn't include? So the feedback would say:
- For H: could be ✓, - , or x? 
Similarly for O,U,S? 
Then for E: might be ""-"" again? 
But we didn't test R? So what? We know R is present? So we need to include R? Otherwise, we won't get information about R's position? 

Therefore, we must include R? And E? Because they are confirmed? 

So words without R? Are wasted? Similarly without E? 

Therefore, we stick to including both? 

So let me choose: 
I am thinking of ""resit""? Which has R and E? 

But note: the word might have double letters? We don't know? 

But for now? 

Actually, ""tires"" is the same letters as ""tries""? But in different order? Without repeating known wrong positions? 

Summary of candidates:

1. ""tires"": 
   - T, I, R, E, S 
   - R in pos 3 (new) 
   - E in pos 4 (new) 

2. ""resit"": 
   - R in pos 1 (new) 
   - E in pos 2 (new) 

Which one is better? 

I am inclined to ""tires""? Because position 1 has T? Which is a common letter? And position 2 has I? Which is common vowel? But also ""resit"" has R as first? which is less common? Actually, many words start with T? 

Another candidate: ""stern"": but has N? Not allowed? 

""brize""? Not a common word? 

So I'll go with ""tires"". 

It avoids C,A,N and puts R and E in new positions? 

Also, letters T, I, S? Are new? Common? 

So let's guess ""tires"". 

But wait: we haven't tried position 1? Position 2? etc? 

Also, if the secret word has I? Then we might find? 

I think it's a good guess? 

Therefore, second guess: <guess>tires</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x""), so they must be avoided.
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked with ""-"").
- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include both R and E (as they are confirmed present) but place R anywhere except position 2 and E anywhere except position 5.
- Avoid C, A, and N entirely.
- Introduce new common letters (like T, I, S) to test additional potential positions.

A strong choice is **""tires""** because:
- It contains R (placed in position 3, a new untested position) and E (placed in position 4, avoiding position 5).
- It avoids C, A, and N.
- It introduces new common letters: T in position 1, I in position 2, and S in position 5 (all not tested before).

This strategically maximizes information gain by testing R and E in new positions while covering new high-frequency letters.",Guess 2: tires -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,sever,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 
 - C and R are common consonants.
 - A and E are common vowels.
 - N is also a common consonant.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 2 and 5 respectively in ""crane"").
- Letters C, A, N are absent.

We have 6 tries total, and this is the second guess.

Now, we need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Doesn't include C, A, N (since they are marked as not in the word)
- Includes R and E (since they are present, but not in the same positions as in ""crane"")
- We must also consider that R and E are in the word but not in the positions we guessed.

In the first guess:
- R was in position 2 (second letter) but is actually in a different position in the secret word.
- E was in position 5 (last letter) but is actually in a different position.

For the second guess, we should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 is wrong and not 5? Actually, it could be in 5 too, because the feedback only says wrong position, not that it can't be in 5. But note: the feedback for R says ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, position 5 is available because it was not tried for R. However, E was in position 5 and we know E is present but not in position 5? No: wait, the feedback for E says it is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1,2,3,4? And similarly, R can be in positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, positions 1,3,4 are common for both? Let me clarify:

The secret word has letters: R and E (and three others) and excludes C, A, N.

We must avoid:
- Using C, A, N anywhere.
- Placing R in position 2 (since that was wrong).
- Placing E in position 5 (since that was wrong).

We also don't know the other letters. We need to choose a word that includes R and E, and avoids C,A,N.

Common letters: Let's try to pick a word that includes other common letters like T, O, I, L, S, etc.

Since R is present, we can try words that start with R? Or have R in another spot.

Also, note that the secret word doesn't have A, so words with A should be avoided.

Let me think of words that include R and E, and without C,A,N.

Possible candidates:

1. Words starting with R: But we don't know if R is first. But we can try? However, we should avoid having R in position 2? Actually, for our next guess, we can put R anywhere except position 2? Or we could? Actually, we can put R anywhere we have not yet ruled out. The feedback tells us only that position 2 is incorrect for R. So R could be in 1,3,4,5? But note: we also have E that must be placed not in position 5.

But wait: the secret word has E somewhere else? So in our next guess, we don't want to put E in position 5 again? Actually, we are allowed, but it might give redundant information? So we should avoid placing E in position 5 because we already know it's not there? Similarly, we should avoid placing R in position 2.

So for our second guess, let's avoid:
- Putting R in position 2
- Putting E in position 5

Also, the word must not contain C, A, N.

We have to guess a word that includes R and E? Actually, not necessarily? Wait no, we know R and E are in the word? Actually, from the feedback, R and E are present? So yes, they must be in the word? Therefore, every subsequent guess must include R and E? But we don't know how many times? So we assume they appear at least once.

Now, we also don't know any other letters.

We can try a word that uses other common letters? Like T, O, I, L, S.

Possible words:

Consider: ""ROTATE"" -> too long? We need 5 letters. And it has A? Which is ruled out? Also has T? But A is excluded? So no A allowed? So ""ROTATE"" has A? So not allowed.

Other words:

- ""STORE"": 
  - S, T, O, R, E.
  - Does it include R? Yes. E? Yes.
  - Avoids C, A, N? Yes.
  - Position: 
    - R is placed in position 4? And we are avoiding position 2? We are not placing R in position 2? Here R is in 4? That's new.
    - E is placed in position 5? But we must avoid? Because E is in position 5? But feedback on E said E(-) meaning it's present but not in position 5? So putting E in position 5 is not allowed? Actually, we can put it? But we already know that position 5 is wrong? So if we put it there, we expect a ""-"" if E is still in the word? But we know it is? So we might get a ""-"" again? Alternatively, we might get a ""x"" if the secret word had two E's and we haven't tried E in other positions? Actually, no: we know there's at least one E? But we should put E in a different position to try to find its correct spot? Therefore, we should avoid position 5? So let's not put E in position 5.

So avoid:
- Letters: C, A, N
- Position 2: R?
- Position 5: E?

Alternatively, we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4? And then we avoid R in position 2? Position 2 can be any letter? Actually, position 2 can be any letter? But R cannot be there? Only that R was in position 2 last time? So we can put E in position 2? Yes, because last time E was not in position 5? But we haven't tested position 2 for E? So yes, we can put E in position 2? But we know that R was in position 2? But R was taken as absent? Actually, no: R is present? But we put R in position 2? But the feedback said it's in the word but not in position 2? So we think R is not in position 2? And E? We don't know? Maybe E is in position 2? We don't know? It could be? So let's try to put E in a position we haven't tried? Currently, we tried E only in position 5? So positions 1,2,3,4? We can try one? Similarly, R: we tried in position 2? So we can try R in 1,3,4,5? But note: position 5? We also tried E in 5? So R can be in 5? Because E was tried in 5? So we can try.

But we might want to test different letters? We haven't tried? Also, we don't know if there might be other letters? So let's choose a word that uses new common letters? Such as T, O, I, L, S.

Possible words:

- ""tires"": T, I, R, E, S -> no C,A,N? Yes. E is in position 4? Not 5. R is in position 3? Not 2? So good! But wait: positions?
  - T in 1st
  - I in 2nd -> we don't know? We don't have info? But we haven't ruled out? 
  - R in 3rd: not 2nd? Previously R was in 2nd? So now we are trying R in 3rd? Which is new.
  - E in 4th? Previously E was in 5th? Now we are trying E in 4th? Which is new.

Alternative: ""robes""? But it has B? Maybe? Also, E in position 5? We wanted to avoid? 
- robes: R, O, B, E, S -> E in position 5? Avoid? So better avoid position 5 for E? 

So ""tires"" seems good? But let me see: what common letters we cover? 
It includes T, I, R, E, S? That's 5 distinct letters? And we exclude C,A,N? Also, we are testing S? Which is common? 

Another option: ""stern"": 
S, T, E, R, N -> but N is excluded? We can't because N was marked as absent? So ""tires"" doesn't have N? Good? 

Also, ""slope"": S, L, O, P, E? But it doesn't include R? We know R must be in the word? Why? Because R was marked as present? And we haven't found the word? So we must include R? Otherwise, we might not get information? However, if we don't include R, then if the new guess has no R and we get feedback that shows R is there? Actually, the feedback will tell us? But we are trying to guess quickly? And we know R is in? So we must include R? Similarly E?

Therefore, in the second guess, we must include both R and E? Yes? Because we know they are present? And also avoid C,A,N? 

We can try ""tries"": T, R, I, E, S? 
This word has R in position 2? But wait: we must avoid putting R in position 2? Because last time R was in position 2? And the feedback said it's present but not in that position? Therefore, putting R in position 2 again? Then the feedback would say ""-"" again? And we learned nothing new? So that wastes a slot? So we should avoid putting R in position 2? Similarly, avoid E in position 5? 

So ""tries"": Positions? 
1: T? 
2: R? -> but we are putting R in position 2? Which we already know is wrong? We expect a ""-"" again? 
3: I? 
4: E? 
5: S? 

We are avoiding E in position 5? But here E is in position 4? So that's okay? But R is in position 2? Which we shouldn't? Actually, we have to avoid position 2 for R? So we cannot use ""tries"" because we are repeating a known wrong position? We want to rule out new positions? So we avoid?

Therefore, ""tires"": 
1: T? 
2: I? 
3: R? -> not in position 2? So new position? 
4: E? -> not in position 5? So new position? 
5: S? 

So that's good? 

Alternatively, ""resit"": 
1: R? 
2: E? -> but we haven't tested position 2? We know R was wrong in 2? But E? We haven't tested E in 2? So we can? But is it a real word? I think RESIT is valid? 

But let me think: We know R is present? Putting R in position 1? We don't know if that's correct? Similarly? 

But we have two positions: R can be in 1,3,4,5? And E in 1,2,3,4? 

If we put R in 1? Then we might get ✓? Or -? Or x if by mistake? But we know R is in? So ✓ or -? 

Similarly, for E? 

In ""resit"": 
R in 1? 
E in 2? 
S in 3? 
I in 4? 
T in 5? 

We avoid: 
- Letters: C,A,N? Yes? 
- R not in 2? Yes? 
- E not in 5? Yes? 

So we are testing R in position 1 and E in position 2? Both new? 

But which one is better? 
We get to test two new positions? 

Alternatively, ""store"": 
S, T, O, R, E -> 
R in position 4? 
E in position 5? But we avoid E in position 5? So that doesn't help? Therefore, we skip.

So between ""tires"" and ""resit""? Both are valid?

Another candidate: ""arise""? But has A? Ruled out? Not allowed.

""opera""? Has O,P,E,R,A? A? Excluded? So not allowed.

""house"": H,O,U,S,E? Doesn't have R? So we don't include R? Then the feedback for R? We know R is in the word? So if we don't include R? We get a problem? The feedback will tell us that R is still missing? Meaning? For each letter? So if we don't include R? Then the position where we don't have R? But for letters? We get feedback for each letter? Specifically? For ""house"", 
H: new? 
O: new? 
U: new? 
S: new? 
E: and E? We know E? But position? E is in position 5? Which we already tested? And was wrong? So we put E again in 5? So we expect ""-"" for E? Because in wrong position? Because we know E is in the word but position 5 is wrong? So we expect ""-""? 
And R? We didn't include? So the feedback would say:
- For H: could be ✓, - , or x? 
Similarly for O,U,S? 
Then for E: might be ""-"" again? 
But we didn't test R? So what? We know R is present? So we need to include R? Otherwise, we won't get information about R's position? 

Therefore, we must include R? And E? Because they are confirmed? 

So words without R? Are wasted? Similarly without E? 

Therefore, we stick to including both? 

So let me choose: 
I am thinking of ""resit""? Which has R and E? 

But note: the word might have double letters? We don't know? 

But for now? 

Actually, ""tires"" is the same letters as ""tries""? But in different order? Without repeating known wrong positions? 

Summary of candidates:

1. ""tires"": 
   - T, I, R, E, S 
   - R in pos 3 (new) 
   - E in pos 4 (new) 

2. ""resit"": 
   - R in pos 1 (new) 
   - E in pos 2 (new) 

Which one is better? 

I am inclined to ""tires""? Because position 1 has T? Which is a common letter? And position 2 has I? Which is common vowel? But also ""resit"" has R as first? which is less common? Actually, many words start with T? 

Another candidate: ""stern"": but has N? Not allowed? 

""brize""? Not a common word? 

So I'll go with ""tires"". 

It avoids C,A,N and puts R and E in new positions? 

Also, letters T, I, S? Are new? Common? 

So let's guess ""tires"". 

But wait: we haven't tried position 1? Position 2? etc? 

Also, if the secret word has I? Then we might find? 

I think it's a good guess? 

Therefore, second guess: <guess>tires</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x""), so they must be avoided.
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked with ""-"").
- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include both R and E (as they are confirmed present) but place R anywhere except position 2 and E anywhere except position 5.
- Avoid C, A, and N entirely.
- Introduce new common letters (like T, I, S) to test additional potential positions.

A strong choice is **""tires""** because:
- It contains R (placed in position 3, a new untested position) and E (placed in position 4, avoiding position 5).
- It avoids C, A, and N.
- It introduces new common letters: T in position 1, I in position 2, and S in position 5 (all not tested before).

This strategically maximizes information gain by testing R and E in new positions while covering new high-frequency letters.

Actually, it could be in 5 too, because the feedback only says wrong position, not that it can\'t be in 5. But note: the feedback for R says ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, position 5 is available because it was not tried for R. However, E was in position 5 and we know E is present but not in position 5? No: wait, the feedback for E says it is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1,2,3,4? And similarly, R can be in positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, positions 1,3,4 are common for both? Let me clarify:\n\nThe secret word has letters: R and E (and three others) and excludes C, A, N.\n\nWe must avoid:\n- Using C, A, N anywhere.\n- Placing R in position 2 (since that was wrong).\n- Placing E in position 5 (since that was wrong).\n\nWe also don\'t know the other letters. We need to choose a word that includes R and E, and avoids C,A,N.\n\nCommon letters: Let\'s try to pick a word that includes other common letters like T, O, I, L, S, etc.\n\nSince R is present, we can try words that start with R? Or have R in another spot.\n\nAlso, note that the secret word doesn\'t have A, so words with A should be avoided.\n\nLet me think of words that include R and E, and without C,A,N.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n1. Words starting with R: But we don\'t know if R is first. But we can try? However, we should avoid having R in position 2? Actually, for our next guess, we can put R anywhere except position 2? Or we could? Actually, we can put R anywhere we have not yet ruled out. The feedback tells us only that position 2 is incorrect for R. So R could be in 1,3,4,5? But note: we also have E that must be placed not in position 5.\n\nBut wait: the secret word has E somewhere else? So in our next guess, we don\'t want to put E in position 5 again? Actually, we are allowed, but it might give redundant information? So we should avoid placing E in position 5 because we already know it\'s not there? Similarly, we should avoid placing R in position 2.\n\nSo for our second guess, let\'s avoid:\n- Putting R in position 2\n- Putting E in position 5\n\nAlso, the word must not contain C, A, N.\n\nWe have to guess a word that includes R and E? Actually, not necessarily? Wait no, we know R and E are in the word? Actually, from the feedback, R and E are present? So yes, they must be in the word? Therefore, every subsequent guess must include R and E? But we don\'t know how many times? So we assume they appear at least once.\n\nNow, we also don\'t know any other letters.\n\nWe can try a word that uses other common letters? Like T, O, I, L, S.\n\nPossible words:\n\nConsider: ""ROTATE"" -> too long? We need 5 letters. And it has A? Which is ruled out? Also has T? But A is excluded? So no A allowed? So ""ROTATE"" has A? So not allowed.\n\nOther words:\n\n- ""STORE"": \n  - S, T, O, R, E.\n  - Does it include R? Yes. E? Yes.\n  - Avoids C, A, N? Yes.\n  - Position: \n    - R is placed in position 4? And we are avoiding position 2? We are not placing R in position 2? Here R is in 4? That\'s new.\n    - E is placed in position 5? But we must avoid? Because E is in position 5? But feedback on E said E(-) meaning it\'s present but not in position 5? So putting E in position 5 is not allowed? Actually, we can put it? But we already know that position 5 is wrong? So if we put it there, we expect a ""-"" if E is still in the word? But we know it is? So we might get a ""-"" again? Alternatively, we might get a ""x"" if the secret word had two E\'s and we haven\'t tried E in other positions? Actually, no: we know there\'s at least one E? But we should put E in a different position to try to find its correct spot? Therefore, we should avoid position 5? So let\'s not put E in position 5.\n\nSo avoid:\n- Letters: C, A, N\n- Position 2: R?\n- Position 5: E?\n\nAlternatively, we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4? And then we avoid R in position 2? Position 2 can be any letter? Actually, position 2 can be any letter? But R cannot be there? Only that R was in position 2 last time? So we can put E in position 2? Yes, because last time E was not in position 5? But we haven\'t tested position 2 for E? So yes, we can put E in position 2? But we know that R was in position 2? But R was taken as absent? Actually, no: R is present? But we put R in position 2? But the feedback said it\'s in the word but not in position 2? So we think R is not in position 2? And E? We don\'t know? Maybe E is in position 2? We don\'t know? It could be? So let\'s try to put E in a position we haven\'t tried? Currently, we tried E only in position 5? So positions 1,2,3,4? We can try one? Similarly, R: we tried in position 2? So we can try R in 1,3,4,5? But note: position 5? We also tried E in 5? So R can be in 5? Because E was tried in 5? So we can try.\n\nBut we might want to test different letters? We haven\'t tried? Also, we don\'t know if there might be other letters? So let\'s choose a word that uses new common letters? Such as T, O, I, L, S.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""tires"": T, I, R, E, S -> no C,A,N? Yes. E is in position 4? Not 5. R is in position 3? Not 2? So good! But wait: positions?\n  - T in 1st\n  - I in 2nd -> we don\'t know? We don\'t have info? But we haven\'t ruled out? \n  - R in 3rd: not 2nd? Previously R was in 2nd? So now we are trying R in 3rd? Which is new.\n  - E in 4th? Previously E was in 5th? Now we are trying E in 4th? Which is new.\n\nAlternative: ""robes""? But it has B? Maybe? Also, E in position 5? We wanted to avoid? \n- robes: R, O, B, E, S -> E in position 5? Avoid? So better avoid position 5 for E? \n\nSo ""tires"" seems good? But let me see: what common letters we cover? \nIt includes T, I, R, E, S? That\'s 5 distinct letters? And we exclude C,A,N? Also, we are testing S? Which is common? \n\nAnother option: ""stern"": \nS, T, E, R, N -> but N is excluded? We can\'t because N was marked as absent? So ""tires"" doesn\'t have N? Good? \n\nAlso, ""slope"": S, L, O, P, E? But it doesn\'t include R? We know R must be in the word? Why? Because R was marked as present? And we haven\'t found the word? So we must include R? Otherwise, we might not get information? However, if we don\'t include R, then if the new guess has no R and we get feedback that shows R is there? Actually, the feedback will tell us? But we are trying to guess quickly? And we know R is in? So we must include R? Similarly E?\n\nTherefore, in the second guess, we must include both R and E? Yes? Because we know they are present? And also avoid C,A,N? \n\nWe can try ""tries"": T, R, I, E, S? \nThis word has R in position 2? But wait: we must avoid putting R in position 2? Because last time R was in position 2? And the feedback said it\'s present but not in that position? Therefore, putting R in position 2 again? Then the feedback would say ""-"" again? And we learned nothing new? So that wastes a slot? So we should avoid putting R in position 2? Similarly, avoid E in position 5? \n\nSo ""tries"": Positions? \n1: T? \n2: R? -> but we are putting R in position 2? Which we already know is wrong? We expect a ""-"" again? \n3: I? \n4: E? \n5: S? \n\nWe are avoiding E in position 5? But here E is in position 4? So that\'s okay? But R is in position 2? Which we shouldn\'t? Actually, we have to avoid position 2 for R? So we cannot use ""tries"" because we are repeating a known wrong position? We want to rule out new positions? So we avoid?\n\nTherefore, ""tires"": \n1: T? \n2: I? \n3: R? -> not in position 2? So new position? \n4: E? -> not in position 5? So new position? \n5: S? \n\nSo that\'s good? \n\nAlternatively, ""resit"": \n1: R? \n2: E? -> but we haven\'t tested position 2? We know R was wrong in 2? But E? We haven\'t tested E in 2? So we can? But is it a real word? I think RESIT is valid? \n\nBut let me think: We know R is present? Putting R in position 1? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? Similarly? \n\nBut we have two positions: R can be in 1,3,4,5? And E in 1,2,3,4? \n\nIf we put R in 1? Then we might get ✓? Or -? Or x if by mistake? But we know R is in? So ✓ or -? \n\nSimilarly, for E? \n\nIn ""resit"": \nR in 1? \nE in 2? \nS in 3? \nI in 4? \nT in 5? \n\nWe avoid: \n- Letters: C,A,N? Yes? \n- R not in 2? Yes? \n- E not in 5? Yes? \n\nSo we are testing R in position 1 and E in position 2? Both new? \n\nBut which one is better? \nWe get to test two new positions? \n\nAlternatively, ""store"": \nS, T, O, R, E -> \nR in position 4? \nE in position 5? But we avoid E in position 5? So that doesn\'t help? Therefore, we skip.\n\nSo between ""tires"" and ""resit""? Both are valid?\n\nAnother candidate: ""arise""? But has A? Ruled out? Not allowed.\n\n""opera""? Has O,P,E,R,A? A? Excluded? So not allowed.\n\n""house"": H,O,U,S,E? Doesn\'t have R? So we don\'t include R? Then the feedback for R? We know R is in the word? So if we don\'t include R? We get a problem? The feedback will tell us that R is still missing? Meaning? For each letter? So if we don\'t include R? Then the position where we don\'t have R? But for letters? We get feedback for each letter? Specifically? For ""house"", \nH: new? \nO: new? \nU: new? \nS: new? \nE: and E? We know E? But position? E is in position 5? Which we already tested? And was wrong? So we put E again in 5? So we expect ""-"" for E? Because in wrong position? Because we know E is in the word but position 5 is wrong? So we expect ""-""? \nAnd R? We didn\'t include? So the feedback would say:\n- For H: could be ✓, - , or x? \nSimilarly for O,U,S? \nThen for E: might be ""-"" again? \nBut we didn\'t test R? So what? We know R is present? So we need to include R? Otherwise, we won\'t get information about R\'s position? \n\nTherefore, we must include R? And E? Because they are confirmed? \n\nSo words without R? Are wasted? Similarly without E? \n\nTherefore, we stick to including both? \n\nSo let me choose: \nI am thinking of ""resit""? Which has R and E? \n\nBut note: the word might have double letters? We don\'t know? \n\nBut for now? \n\nActually, ""tires"" is the same letters as ""tries""? But in different order? Without repeating known wrong positions? \n\nSummary of candidates:\n\n1. ""tires"": \n   - T, I, R, E, S \n   - R in pos 3 (new) \n   - E in pos 4 (new) \n\n2. ""resit"": \n   - R in pos 1 (new) \n   - E in pos 2 (new) \n\nWhich one is better? \n\nI am inclined to ""tires""? Because position 1 has T? Which is a common letter? And position 2 has I? Which is common vowel? But also ""resit"" has R as first? which is less common? Actually, many words start with T? \n\nAnother candidate: ""stern"": but has N? Not allowed? \n\n""brize""? Not a common word? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""tires"". \n\nIt avoids C,A,N and puts R and E in new positions? \n\nAlso, letters T, I, S? Are new? Common? \n\nSo let\'s guess ""tires"". \n\nBut wait: we haven\'t tried position 1? Position 2? etc? \n\nAlso, if the secret word has I? Then we might find? \n\nI think it\'s a good guess? \n\nTherefore, second guess: <guess>tires</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x""), so they must be avoided.\n- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked with ""-"").\n- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked with ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include both R and E (as they are confirmed present) but place R anywhere except position 2 and E anywhere except position 5.\n- Avoid C, A, and N entirely.\n- Introduce new common letters (like T, I, S) to test additional potential positions.\n\nA strong choice is **""tires""** because:\n- It contains R (placed in position 3, a new untested position) and E (placed in position 4, avoiding position 5).\n- It avoids C, A, and N.\n- It introduces new common letters: T in position 1, I in position 2, and S in position 5 (all not tested before).\n\nThis strategically maximizes information gain by testing R and E in new positions while covering new high-frequency letters.\n\n<guess>tires</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tires -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C, A, N: absent.
- R: present but not in position 2 (so in position 1, 3, or 4? But note: positions are 1-based? Actually, in the example: BRISK and STORM: S is position 1? So ""crane"": C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5). Feedback: R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. E(-) meaning E is in the word but not in position 5.

Second guess: ""tires"" -> T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
Interpretation:
- T: absent (x) -> so T is not in the word.
- I: absent (x) -> so I is not in the word.
- R: present but not in position 3 (because R was guessed in position 3? ""tires"": T(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), S(5). Feedback: R(-) so R is present but not in position 3.
- E: correct! (✓) in position 4. So E is in the secret word at position 4.
- S: present but not in position 5. So S is in the word but not in position 5.

Now, we have:
- The secret word contains: R (present), E (correct at position 4), S (present).
- Additional letters: we know E is at position 4.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N (from first guess), T, I (from second guess).
- Also note: we have information about positions for R and S.

Specifically:
- R is present but:
  - Not in position 2 (from ""crane"")
  - Not in position 3 (from ""tires"")
  - And since E is at position 4, R cannot be there? R can be in positions 1 or 5? Because remaining positions are 1, 5? Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. E is fixed at 4? So R must be in one of 1,5? Actually, also? What about position 2 and 3 we know R is not? And position 4 is E? So R must be either in position 1 or position 5? Unless there are multiple letters? But we haven't had any indication? But we don't know? There might be two R's? But let's assume no duplicates? Typically? We might need to consider? But for now? 

Similarly, S:
- From ""crane"": we tried S? Actually, we didn't? ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E? No S? So first time we see S? Then ""tires"" had S at position 5? Feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not at position 5? So S must be in positions 1,2,3? But note: position 4 is taken by E? So available positions: 1,2,3? And R is also to be placed in either 1 or 5? But S? So they might share? Actually, S could be in 1,2, or 3? And R in 1 or 5? So conflict? Only at position 1? That is, if R is in 1, then S cannot be in 1? So S must be in 2 or 3? And if R is in 5, then S in 1,2,3 anywhere? 

Currently, we don't know the fifth letter? We have: 
- Position 4: E (locked)
- R must be in 1 or 5?
- S in 2,3? Or if R in 5 then S in 1,2,3? But we also have two other letters? We know the secret word has 5 distinct? Actually, we don't know? Some words have repeated letters? But let's avoid assuming? 

Known letters: 
- R: present (in 1 or 5)
- S: present (in wherever) and not in 5? 
- E: at 4.
- And we know the word has two more letters? Because we haven't found all? 

Excluded? Total excluded: C, A, N, T, I.

Also, we must avoid using these?

We need to guess a word that:
1. Must include R and S (they are present).
2. Must have E at position 4.
3. Avoids C,A,N,T,I.
4. Must have two more letters? And we don't know? 

Furthermore, we have constraints on R and S positions:
- R: must not be in position 2 or 3? And since position 4 is E? So only options: position 1 or 5? 
- S: must not be in position 5? And we haven't tried positions 1,2,3? So S must be in 1,2, or 3? But if R is in position 1, then S must be in 2 or 3? If R in 5, S can be in 1,2,3? 

We also would like to test other positions?

We don't know the fifth (third) letter? And another letter? We know the secret word has 5 letters? We have E fixed? And R? And S? And two more? So two unknowns?

We need to guess a word that fits these constraints? 

Let's look for words with pattern: 
- Position 4: E
- Position 1: either R or something else? But if R is in 1? Then word starts with R? Or if not? 

Possible words:

Consider R at position 1? Then S in 2 or 3? 

Options:
R at 1, E at 4: 
- Words like: R? ? E? E? 
But we have S? 

For example: 
ROSE? But O? And S? Position 5 must be something? 
R O S E? Wait: positions: 
1: R? 
2: O? 
3: S? 
4: E? 
5: ? But we have S at position 3? Then the fifth letter? Also, let's see: does it avoid C,A,N,T,I? Yes? Then what? 
But we haven't fixed the fifth letter? 

Other words: R with E at fourth? 

But alternatively, R at position 5? Then the word ends with R? And position 4 is E? So ...E R? 

Now, we want to test positions? Also, we haven't tested letters? 

Common letters remaining? Excluding C,A,N,T,I? Remaining letters: 
B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common letters? For example: O, L, U, P, etc. 

Let's try to form words:

Case 1: R in position 1? Then S in position 2 or 3? 
- If S in position 2: R S ? E ? 
- Possibilities: R S _ E _ ? 
  Words: R S (letter) E (letter) -> RS?E?
  Possible: ROSE (but O is in? But O? Then E? Then? Wait: R O S E -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E -> but in this, S is at position 3? Then fifth letter? ROSE? Not 5 letters? Wait, ROSE is 4? But 5-letter words: ROSED? Not valid? 
  Actually: ROBES? But we avoid B? Maybe? Or wait, we haven't ruled out? 

But let's search:
Possible words: 
- ""ROLES"": 
  1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S? -> but we know S? And we have S at position 5? But S cannot be in position 5? Because from ""tires"", S was at 5 and feedback said - meaning wrong position? So position 5 is invalid for S? Therefore, if R at 1? We cannot have S at 5? 

Also, ""tires"" feedback: S(-) meaning S is not at 5? So in any guess? We avoid S in position 5? 

Therefore, for R in 1? We must put S in 2 or 3? 

If R in 1, S in 2: pattern R S ? E ? 
Possible words? 
RS?E? 
Examples: 
- R S ? E ? 
""rs"" are rare? Maybe ""ruse""? But we know E at 4? So R U S E ...? Wait: position 4 is E? And E must be at 4? So R S ? E ? 
So positions: 1:R,2:S,3:?,4:E,5:? 
Then the word? Must be 5 letters? Valid: RSLEE? Not valid? ""rise""? Wait: ""rise"" is 4 letters? 
We need 5-letter words? 
For 1:R,2:S,3:?,4:E,5:? 
Valid words? 
- ""RUSES"": But S appears twice? And at position 5? Also S? But already excluded? 
Or ""RASED"": But A? Excluded? 
""RUSLE"": Not valid? 
Perhaps no common words? 

Alternatively: R at 1, S at position 3: pattern R ? S E ? 
Examples: 
1:R,2:?,3:S,4:E,5:? 
Valid words: 
- ""ROUSE"": R O U S E -> yes? 
Letters: O,U -> not excluded? 
Also, ""REUSE"": R E U S E -> but E repeated? And E is at position 2? Duplicated E? Then for position 2: E? But the secret word? We know E is at position 4? But there might be two E? 
Actually, the feedback might show? 
But let's see if it's possible? 

Similarly, ""raise"": has A? Excluded? 
""rouse"": R O U S E -> 
1:R,2:O,3:U,4:S? Wait, S? But we need E at 4? And S at position? 
- Actually: ""rouse"": R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> no E at 4? That doesn't work? 
We need E at 4? So ""rouse""? Cannot? 

How about ""RESET""? But R at 1? Position 4: E? So R E S E T? 
1:R, 2:E, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T? 
But T is excluded? 
Not valid? 

Another word: ""RIPES""? I excluded? 

So perhaps none without excluded letters? 

Alternative: R at position 5? Pattern: ? ? ? E R? 
Then S? Can be at 1,2,3? 

Pattern: _ _ _ E R? 
And S must be in 1,2,3? 

Now, words: ... E R? 

Examples: 
- ""__SER"" -> then S at position 3? 
  For example: ""POSER"", ""LOSER"", ""HOSER"", ""ROGER"" is R O G E R -> repeated R? Duplicated R? But we don't know if possible? 
But R? We must include R? And if R is at 5? Then there is only one R? 
So words must have S somewhere? And E at 4? R at 5? 

Pattern: _ _ S E R? 
Then first two letters: two more letters? For example: ""PASER"" -> has A? Excluded? 
""USER"" -> but 4 letters? 
5-letter: ""HOSER"": H O S E R -> 
Positions: 
1: H? 
2: O? 
3: S? 
4: E? 
5: R? 
This works? 
Avoids C,A,N,T,I? Yes? 
And R is at position 5? Which is allowed? 
S is at position 3? Which is not 5? So okay? 
But we haven't tried O and H before? 

Alternatively: S at position 1: pattern S _ _ E R? 
Words: ""S_ _ER"" 
Examples: ""SOWER"", ""SUPER"", ""SABER"" (has A? excluded), ""SHEER"" (double E? and E at 4 but also other E?), ""SHOER""? Not common? 

S at position 2: pattern _ S ? E R? 
For example: ""ASPER"" (has A? excluded), ""ISLER""? Not common? 

So ""HOSER"" seems good? 

But let me see: common letters? 

Another pattern: without S? But we must include S? Wait? 

We know:
- R must be in 1 or 5?
- E at 4?
- S must be in 1,2,3? Except if R in 1? Then S cannot in 1? 

But also, we don't know the other letters? 

We can also consider: maybe S is the other possible position? 

But let me try: we need to guess? And there is also the possibility that R is in position 1? And we haven't found? 

Maybe we can try a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to commit? 

Another idea: we know the word has S? But not found? 

We can try ""loser"": L O S E R -> 
Positions: 
1: L? 
2: O? 
3: S? 
4: E? 
5: R? 
Pattern: S at position 3? And R at 5? 
Avoids all forbidden letters? 

But is it valid? Yes? 
Also, ""loser"" avoids C,A,N,T,I? 

Similarly, we can use ""homer"": H O M E R? 
But E at 4? R at 5? 
S? Where? Doesn't include S? Then feedback? We know S must be in the word? Why? Because we had ""tires"" guess? S(-)? So S must be in the word? So if we don't include S? Then feedback? We would get S missing? But we know S is present? So we must include S? 

Therefore, ""loser"" has S? At position 3? 

""loser"": L,O,S,E,R -> yes? 
So: 
- Position 3: S? Which we haven't tried? 
- Position 5: R? Which we tried? But we know R is present? And we are testing a new position? Because R was not tried in 5? 

Previously? We tried R only in positions 2 and 3? And wrong? And E is known at 4? 
So R in 5 is untested? 

Also, S? Tried in position 5? Found wrong? But now S in 3? Untested? And we expect S to be there? Maybe? 

Common word? Yes? 

Alternatively? Another word: ""muser"": M U S E R? 
Also? 

But ""loser"" is more common? 

Another: ""poser"": P O S E R? 

All valid? 

Now? Which one to choose? 

We can choose ""loser""? It includes L and O? New letters? 

Also? Notice: in ""tires"", we have E at 4? That was correct? So we can rely? 

Therefore, guess ""loser""? 

But we have R at 5? And S at 3? 

Also? If it's not? We get feedback? 

Another candidate: if R is in position 1? Then we need S in 2 or 3? And E at 4? 

For example: word ""robed""? But we avoid? Or ""rubel""? Not common? 

""RISEN""? Has I? Excluded? 

""RESOD""? R E S O D? Then: 1:R,2:E,3:S,4:O,5:D? But E at 4? But we have E at 4? Fixed? So position 2:E? Then? 
Wait? Our pattern? If R at 1? Then we can have E at 4? But position 2? We haven't tested for E? Actually, we know E is at 4? So position 2 should not be E? Because E is only at 4? We don't know? In secret word? E is only at 4? Or could be elsewhere? Actually, the feedback? For ""crane"": E(-) meaning E is present but not at 5? Then for ""tires"": E(✓) at 4? That's correct? So E is fixed at 4? And there are no other E? So we must not put E elsewhere? 

Therefore, any word must have E only at position 4? 

Therefore, for R at position 1? We cannot have E at 2? 

Similarly? 

So pattern for R at 1: 
1:R, 2:?, 3: (S or ?) ,4:E, 5:? 
And S must be in 2 or 3? If in 3: R ? S E ? 
Valid? 
1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:P? ""rosep""? Not valid? 
1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:M? ""rosem""? No? 
1:R, 2:U, 3:S, 4:E, 5:D? ""rused""? Not common? 
But ""ruse""? Is 4 letters? 
How about ""RUSES""? But S twice? And E at 4? So R U S E S? Then positions: 
1:R,2:U,3:S,4:E,5:S -> but S at 3 and 5? But from ""tires"", we have S? And we know S? So if we use duplicate? Then feedback? 

But for now? We assume no duplicate? Because we haven't seen? 

Actually? We don't know? 

But common words? 

Therefore? The better bet seems R in 5? And we choose ""loser""? 

Additionally? We could try ""poser""? P O S E R? 

But why? 

Also? Note? We haven't used P,O,L? 

Now? Both ""loser"" and ""poser"" are valid? 

But let's choose? 

Actually? There is another constraint: the word must not contain any excluded letters? 

So? 

I think ""loser"" is good? 

Therefore? Third guess: loser

But wait? The word ""loser""? It includes L, O, S, E, R? 
S is at position 3? And we haven't tested S? And R at 5? 

Expected feedback? 

If the secret word? For example? 

Perhaps? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that rules out the other possibility? But it's fine? 

Let me try? 

So guess? ""loser""? 

But wait? Another word: ""SUPER""? But it starts with S? Pattern S _ _ E R? 
If S at 1? Then word: S U P E R? 
Positions: 
1:S? 
2: ? 
3:? 
4:E? 
5:R? 
Now? In this? S at first? Which hasn't been tested? 
R at last? 
But U and P? 

Also? Avoids excluded letters? 

But we know? From ""tires"", I was excluded? 

Now? ""SUPER""? S,U,P,E,R? 

But P? Not tested? 

But? Also? R at 5? 

Compared to ""loser""? L,O,S,E,R? 

Both seem fine? 

Perhaps ""super"" is shorter? 

But? Actually? Let me see? 

But? We also need to consider: in ""loser""? Position 3:S? And position 5:R? 

In ""super""? Position 1:S? Then? 

We could? But? 

But? By guessing ""loser""? Or ""super""? 

But? We have? 

I think we can go with ""loser"". 

Therefore: 

<guess>loser</guess> 

But? Let's double-check? 

Summary: 
- Positions: We know position 4 must be E? 
- R: must be in 1 or 5? 
- S: must be in 1,2,3? 
- Avoid C,A,N,T,I? 

In ""loser"": 
- Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:R 
- We are testing R in position 5? (and also S in position 3) 

If the secret word has R in 5? Then we might get R✓? Or if not? Then wrong? 

We'll see? 

Alternatively? If R is not in 5? Then we learn that R must be in 1? 

But? For this guess? 

Yes? 

So? 

I choose ""loser"". 

But? We still have to write? 

Note: We must include all? 

Actually? Let me list the known? 

Perhaps? There are other constraints? 

In the second guess ""tires""? We learned E(✓) at 4? 

Also? R(-) at 3? 

Now? 

We are guessing? 

I think? 

Therefore? 

Final guess: loser
</think>
### Reasoning for the Next Guess

We have two previous guesses with feedback:

1. **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
   - `C`, `A`, `N` are absent from the secret word.  
   - `R` is present but not in position 2.  
   - `E` is present but not in position 5.  

2. **Guess 2: tires → Feedback: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)**  
   - `T` and `I` are absent.  
   - `R` is present but not in position 3.  
   - `E` is correct and fixed in position 4!  
   - `S` is present but not in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters:**  
  - `E` is locked at position 4.  
  - `R` and `S` are present in the word.
- **Absent letters:** `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I` must be avoided.  
- **Position constraints for `R`:**  
  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or 3 (from ""tires"").  
  - Since position 4 is occupied by `E`, `R` must be in position 1 or 5 (*no duplicates inferred yet*).  
- **Position constraints for `S`:**  
  - Cannot be in position 5 (from ""tires"").  
  - Must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
- **Unknowns:** Two letters remain unknown (besides `E`, `R`, `S`), with no duplicates implied.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include `R` and `S`:** Both are confirmed present.  
- **Position `R` correctly:** Prioritize testing `R` in position 1 or 5 to resolve its location.  
- **Position `S` strategically:** Place `S` in an untested position (1, 2, or 3), avoiding position 5.  
- **Introduce new, common letters:** Test high-frequency consonants/vowels not yet evaluated (e.g., `L`, `O`, `M`) to gather more information.  
- **Avoid guessing `R` in position 5 if `S` is in position 1:** Both letters share possible positions, but feedback will clarify conflicts.  

Ideal word suggestions:
- **`loser`**:  
  - `L` (position 1), `O` (position 2), `S` (position 3), `E` (position 4), `R` (position 5).  
  - Tests `R` in position 5 and `S` in position 3 (both new positions).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (`C`/`A`/`N`/`T`/`I`).  
  - Introduces `L` and `O` for additional coverage.  
- **Alternative: `poser` or `super`**  
  - Similar pattern but less common letters; `loser` is prioritized as it follows the constraints elegantly.

### Why `loser`?
- If correct: Wins the game (but unlikely this early).  
- If partial: Feedback on `R` (position 5) will confirm if `R` belongs at the end or start (position 1).  
- Feedback on `S` (position 3) and new letters (`L`, `O`) will simplify next guesses.

<guess>loser</guess>",loser,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C, A, N: absent.
- R: present but not in position 2 (so in position 1, 3, or 4? But note: positions are 1-based? Actually, in the example: BRISK and STORM: S is position 1? So ""crane"": C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5). Feedback: R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. E(-) meaning E is in the word but not in position 5.

Second guess: ""tires"" -> T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
Interpretation:
- T: absent (x) -> so T is not in the word.
- I: absent (x) -> so I is not in the word.
- R: present but not in position 3 (because R was guessed in position 3? ""tires"": T(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), S(5). Feedback: R(-) so R is present but not in position 3.
- E: correct! (✓) in position 4. So E is in the secret word at position 4.
- S: present but not in position 5. So S is in the word but not in position 5.

Now, we have:
- The secret word contains: R (present), E (correct at position 4), S (present).
- Additional letters: we know E is at position 4.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N (from first guess), T, I (from second guess).
- Also note: we have information about positions for R and S.

Specifically:
- R is present but:
  - Not in position 2 (from ""crane"")
  - Not in position 3 (from ""tires"")
  - And since E is at position 4, R cannot be there? R can be in positions 1 or 5? Because remaining positions are 1, 5? Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. E is fixed at 4? So R must be in one of 1,5? Actually, also? What about position 2 and 3 we know R is not? And position 4 is E? So R must be either in position 1 or position 5? Unless there are multiple letters? But we haven't had any indication? But we don't know? There might be two R's? But let's assume no duplicates? Typically? We might need to consider? But for now? 

Similarly, S:
- From ""crane"": we tried S? Actually, we didn't? ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E? No S? So first time we see S? Then ""tires"" had S at position 5? Feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not at position 5? So S must be in positions 1,2,3? But note: position 4 is taken by E? So available positions: 1,2,3? And R is also to be placed in either 1 or 5? But S? So they might share? Actually, S could be in 1,2, or 3? And R in 1 or 5? So conflict? Only at position 1? That is, if R is in 1, then S cannot be in 1? So S must be in 2 or 3? And if R is in 5, then S in 1,2,3 anywhere? 

Currently, we don't know the fifth letter? We have: 
- Position 4: E (locked)
- R must be in 1 or 5?
- S in 2,3? Or if R in 5 then S in 1,2,3? But we also have two other letters? We know the secret word has 5 distinct? Actually, we don't know? Some words have repeated letters? But let's avoid assuming? 

Known letters: 
- R: present (in 1 or 5)
- S: present (in wherever) and not in 5? 
- E: at 4.
- And we know the word has two more letters? Because we haven't found all? 

Excluded? Total excluded: C, A, N, T, I.

Also, we must avoid using these?

We need to guess a word that:
1. Must include R and S (they are present).
2. Must have E at position 4.
3. Avoids C,A,N,T,I.
4. Must have two more letters? And we don't know? 

Furthermore, we have constraints on R and S positions:
- R: must not be in position 2 or 3? And since position 4 is E? So only options: position 1 or 5? 
- S: must not be in position 5? And we haven't tried positions 1,2,3? So S must be in 1,2, or 3? But if R is in position 1, then S must be in 2 or 3? If R in 5, S can be in 1,2,3? 

We also would like to test other positions?

We don't know the fifth (third) letter? And another letter? We know the secret word has 5 letters? We have E fixed? And R? And S? And two more? So two unknowns?

We need to guess a word that fits these constraints? 

Let's look for words with pattern: 
- Position 4: E
- Position 1: either R or something else? But if R is in 1? Then word starts with R? Or if not? 

Possible words:

Consider R at position 1? Then S in 2 or 3? 

Options:
R at 1, E at 4: 
- Words like: R? ? E? E? 
But we have S? 

For example: 
ROSE? But O? And S? Position 5 must be something? 
R O S E? Wait: positions: 
1: R? 
2: O? 
3: S? 
4: E? 
5: ? But we have S at position 3? Then the fifth letter? Also, let's see: does it avoid C,A,N,T,I? Yes? Then what? 
But we haven't fixed the fifth letter? 

Other words: R with E at fourth? 

But alternatively, R at position 5? Then the word ends with R? And position 4 is E? So ...E R? 

Now, we want to test positions? Also, we haven't tested letters? 

Common letters remaining? Excluding C,A,N,T,I? Remaining letters: 
B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common letters? For example: O, L, U, P, etc. 

Let's try to form words:

Case 1: R in position 1? Then S in position 2 or 3? 
- If S in position 2: R S ? E ? 
- Possibilities: R S _ E _ ? 
  Words: R S (letter) E (letter) -> RS?E?
  Possible: ROSE (but O is in? But O? Then E? Then? Wait: R O S E -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E -> but in this, S is at position 3? Then fifth letter? ROSE? Not 5 letters? Wait, ROSE is 4? But 5-letter words: ROSED? Not valid? 
  Actually: ROBES? But we avoid B? Maybe? Or wait, we haven't ruled out? 

But let's search:
Possible words: 
- ""ROLES"": 
  1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S? -> but we know S? And we have S at position 5? But S cannot be in position 5? Because from ""tires"", S was at 5 and feedback said - meaning wrong position? So position 5 is invalid for S? Therefore, if R at 1? We cannot have S at 5? 

Also, ""tires"" feedback: S(-) meaning S is not at 5? So in any guess? We avoid S in position 5? 

Therefore, for R in 1? We must put S in 2 or 3? 

If R in 1, S in 2: pattern R S ? E ? 
Possible words? 
RS?E? 
Examples: 
- R S ? E ? 
""rs"" are rare? Maybe ""ruse""? But we know E at 4? So R U S E ...? Wait: position 4 is E? And E must be at 4? So R S ? E ? 
So positions: 1:R,2:S,3:?,4:E,5:? 
Then the word? Must be 5 letters? Valid: RSLEE? Not valid? ""rise""? Wait: ""rise"" is 4 letters? 
We need 5-letter words? 
For 1:R,2:S,3:?,4:E,5:? 
Valid words? 
- ""RUSES"": But S appears twice? And at position 5? Also S? But already excluded? 
Or ""RASED"": But A? Excluded? 
""RUSLE"": Not valid? 
Perhaps no common words? 

Alternatively: R at 1, S at position 3: pattern R ? S E ? 
Examples: 
1:R,2:?,3:S,4:E,5:? 
Valid words: 
- ""ROUSE"": R O U S E -> yes? 
Letters: O,U -> not excluded? 
Also, ""REUSE"": R E U S E -> but E repeated? And E is at position 2? Duplicated E? Then for position 2: E? But the secret word? We know E is at position 4? But there might be two E? 
Actually, the feedback might show? 
But let's see if it's possible? 

Similarly, ""raise"": has A? Excluded? 
""rouse"": R O U S E -> 
1:R,2:O,3:U,4:S? Wait, S? But we need E at 4? And S at position? 
- Actually: ""rouse"": R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> no E at 4? That doesn't work? 
We need E at 4? So ""rouse""? Cannot? 

How about ""RESET""? But R at 1? Position 4: E? So R E S E T? 
1:R, 2:E, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T? 
But T is excluded? 
Not valid? 

Another word: ""RIPES""? I excluded? 

So perhaps none without excluded letters? 

Alternative: R at position 5? Pattern: ? ? ? E R? 
Then S? Can be at 1,2,3? 

Pattern: _ _ _ E R? 
And S must be in 1,2,3? 

Now, words: ... E R? 

Examples: 
- ""__SER"" -> then S at position 3? 
  For example: ""POSER"", ""LOSER"", ""HOSER"", ""ROGER"" is R O G E R -> repeated R? Duplicated R? But we don't know if possible? 
But R? We must include R? And if R is at 5? Then there is only one R? 
So words must have S somewhere? And E at 4? R at 5? 

Pattern: _ _ S E R? 
Then first two letters: two more letters? For example: ""PASER"" -> has A? Excluded? 
""USER"" -> but 4 letters? 
5-letter: ""HOSER"": H O S E R -> 
Positions: 
1: H? 
2: O? 
3: S? 
4: E? 
5: R? 
This works? 
Avoids C,A,N,T,I? Yes? 
And R is at position 5? Which is allowed? 
S is at position 3? Which is not 5? So okay? 
But we haven't tried O and H before? 

Alternatively: S at position 1: pattern S _ _ E R? 
Words: ""S_ _ER"" 
Examples: ""SOWER"", ""SUPER"", ""SABER"" (has A? excluded), ""SHEER"" (double E? and E at 4 but also other E?), ""SHOER""? Not common? 

S at position 2: pattern _ S ? E R? 
For example: ""ASPER"" (has A? excluded), ""ISLER""? Not common? 

So ""HOSER"" seems good? 

But let me see: common letters? 

Another pattern: without S? But we must include S? Wait? 

We know:
- R must be in 1 or 5?
- E at 4?
- S must be in 1,2,3? Except if R in 1? Then S cannot in 1? 

But also, we don't know the other letters? 

We can also consider: maybe S is the other possible position? 

But let me try: we need to guess? And there is also the possibility that R is in position 1? And we haven't found? 

Maybe we can try a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to commit? 

Another idea: we know the word has S? But not found? 

We can try ""loser"": L O S E R -> 
Positions: 
1: L? 
2: O? 
3: S? 
4: E? 
5: R? 
Pattern: S at position 3? And R at 5? 
Avoids all forbidden letters? 

But is it valid? Yes? 
Also, ""loser"" avoids C,A,N,T,I? 

Similarly, we can use ""homer"": H O M E R? 
But E at 4? R at 5? 
S? Where? Doesn't include S? Then feedback? We know S must be in the word? Why? Because we had ""tires"" guess? S(-)? So S must be in the word? So if we don't include S? Then feedback? We would get S missing? But we know S is present? So we must include S? 

Therefore, ""loser"" has S? At position 3? 

""loser"": L,O,S,E,R -> yes? 
So: 
- Position 3: S? Which we haven't tried? 
- Position 5: R? Which we tried? But we know R is present? And we are testing a new position? Because R was not tried in 5? 

Previously? We tried R only in positions 2 and 3? And wrong? And E is known at 4? 
So R in 5 is untested? 

Also, S? Tried in position 5? Found wrong? But now S in 3? Untested? And we expect S to be there? Maybe? 

Common word? Yes? 

Alternatively? Another word: ""muser"": M U S E R? 
Also? 

But ""loser"" is more common? 

Another: ""poser"": P O S E R? 

All valid? 

Now? Which one to choose? 

We can choose ""loser""? It includes L and O? New letters? 

Also? Notice: in ""tires"", we have E at 4? That was correct? So we can rely? 

Therefore, guess ""loser""? 

But we have R at 5? And S at 3? 

Also? If it's not? We get feedback? 

Another candidate: if R is in position 1? Then we need S in 2 or 3? And E at 4? 

For example: word ""robed""? But we avoid? Or ""rubel""? Not common? 

""RISEN""? Has I? Excluded? 

""RESOD""? R E S O D? Then: 1:R,2:E,3:S,4:O,5:D? But E at 4? But we have E at 4? Fixed? So position 2:E? Then? 
Wait? Our pattern? If R at 1? Then we can have E at 4? But position 2? We haven't tested for E? Actually, we know E is at 4? So position 2 should not be E? Because E is only at 4? We don't know? In secret word? E is only at 4? Or could be elsewhere? Actually, the feedback? For ""crane"": E(-) meaning E is present but not at 5? Then for ""tires"": E(✓) at 4? That's correct? So E is fixed at 4? And there are no other E? So we must not put E elsewhere? 

Therefore, any word must have E only at position 4? 

Therefore, for R at position 1? We cannot have E at 2? 

Similarly? 

So pattern for R at 1: 
1:R, 2:?, 3: (S or ?) ,4:E, 5:? 
And S must be in 2 or 3? If in 3: R ? S E ? 
Valid? 
1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:P? ""rosep""? Not valid? 
1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:M? ""rosem""? No? 
1:R, 2:U, 3:S, 4:E, 5:D? ""rused""? Not common? 
But ""ruse""? Is 4 letters? 
How about ""RUSES""? But S twice? And E at 4? So R U S E S? Then positions: 
1:R,2:U,3:S,4:E,5:S -> but S at 3 and 5? But from ""tires"", we have S? And we know S? So if we use duplicate? Then feedback? 

But for now? We assume no duplicate? Because we haven't seen? 

Actually? We don't know? 

But common words? 

Therefore? The better bet seems R in 5? And we choose ""loser""? 

Additionally? We could try ""poser""? P O S E R? 

But why? 

Also? Note? We haven't used P,O,L? 

Now? Both ""loser"" and ""poser"" are valid? 

But let's choose? 

Actually? There is another constraint: the word must not contain any excluded letters? 

So? 

I think ""loser"" is good? 

Therefore? Third guess: loser

But wait? The word ""loser""? It includes L, O, S, E, R? 
S is at position 3? And we haven't tested S? And R at 5? 

Expected feedback? 

If the secret word? For example? 

Perhaps? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that rules out the other possibility? But it's fine? 

Let me try? 

So guess? ""loser""? 

But wait? Another word: ""SUPER""? But it starts with S? Pattern S _ _ E R? 
If S at 1? Then word: S U P E R? 
Positions: 
1:S? 
2: ? 
3:? 
4:E? 
5:R? 
Now? In this? S at first? Which hasn't been tested? 
R at last? 
But U and P? 

Also? Avoids excluded letters? 

But we know? From ""tires"", I was excluded? 

Now? ""SUPER""? S,U,P,E,R? 

But P? Not tested? 

But? Also? R at 5? 

Compared to ""loser""? L,O,S,E,R? 

Both seem fine? 

Perhaps ""super"" is shorter? 

But? Actually? Let me see? 

But? We also need to consider: in ""loser""? Position 3:S? And position 5:R? 

In ""super""? Position 1:S? Then? 

We could? But? 

But? By guessing ""loser""? Or ""super""? 

But? We have? 

I think we can go with ""loser"". 

Therefore: 

<guess>loser</guess> 

But? Let's double-check? 

Summary: 
- Positions: We know position 4 must be E? 
- R: must be in 1 or 5? 
- S: must be in 1,2,3? 
- Avoid C,A,N,T,I? 

In ""loser"": 
- Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:R 
- We are testing R in position 5? (and also S in position 3) 

If the secret word has R in 5? Then we might get R✓? Or if not? Then wrong? 

We'll see? 

Alternatively? If R is not in 5? Then we learn that R must be in 1? 

But? For this guess? 

Yes? 

So? 

I choose ""loser"". 

But? We still have to write? 

Note: We must include all? 

Actually? Let me list the known? 

Perhaps? There are other constraints? 

In the second guess ""tires""? We learned E(✓) at 4? 

Also? R(-) at 3? 

Now? 

We are guessing? 

I think? 

Therefore? 

Final guess: loser### Reasoning for the Next Guess

We have two previous guesses with feedback:

1. **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
   - `C`, `A`, `N` are absent from the secret word.  
   - `R` is present but not in position 2.  
   - `E` is present but not in position 5.  

2. **Guess 2: tires → Feedback: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)**  
   - `T` and `I` are absent.  
   - `R` is present but not in position 3.  
   - `E` is correct and fixed in position 4!  
   - `S` is present but not in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters:**  
  - `E` is locked at position 4.  
  - `R` and `S` are present in the word.
- **Absent letters:** `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I` must be avoided.  
- **Position constraints for `R`:**  
  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or 3 (from ""tires"").  
  - Since position 4 is occupied by `E`, `R` must be in position 1 or 5 (*no duplicates inferred yet*).  
- **Position constraints for `S`:**  
  - Cannot be in position 5 (from ""tires"").  
  - Must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
- **Unknowns:** Two letters remain unknown (besides `E`, `R`, `S`), with no duplicates implied.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include `R` and `S`:** Both are confirmed present.  
- **Position `R` correctly:** Prioritize testing `R` in position 1 or 5 to resolve its location.  
- **Position `S` strategically:** Place `S` in an untested position (1, 2, or 3), avoiding position 5.  
- **Introduce new, common letters:** Test high-frequency consonants/vowels not yet evaluated (e.g., `L`, `O`, `M`) to gather more information.  
- **Avoid guessing `R` in position 5 if `S` is in position 1:** Both letters share possible positions, but feedback will clarify conflicts.  

Ideal word suggestions:
- **`loser`**:  
  - `L` (position 1), `O` (position 2), `S` (position 3), `E` (position 4), `R` (position 5).  
  - Tests `R` in position 5 and `S` in position 3 (both new positions).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (`C`/`A`/`N`/`T`/`I`).  
  - Introduces `L` and `O` for additional coverage.  
- **Alternative: `poser` or `super`**  
  - Similar pattern but less common letters; `loser` is prioritized as it follows the constraints elegantly.

### Why `loser`?
- If correct: Wins the game (but unlikely this early).  
- If partial: Feedback on `R` (position 5) will confirm if `R` belongs at the end or start (position 1).  
- Feedback on `S` (position 3) and new letters (`L`, `O`) will simplify next guesses.",Guess 3: loser -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,sever,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 
 - C and R are common consonants.
 - A and E are common vowels.
 - N is also a common consonant.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 2 and 5 respectively in ""crane"").
- Letters C, A, N are absent.

We have 6 tries total, and this is the second guess.

Now, we need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Doesn't include C, A, N (since they are marked as not in the word)
- Includes R and E (since they are present, but not in the same positions as in ""crane"")
- We must also consider that R and E are in the word but not in the positions we guessed.

In the first guess:
- R was in position 2 (second letter) but is actually in a different position in the secret word.
- E was in position 5 (last letter) but is actually in a different position.

For the second guess, we should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 is wrong and not 5? Actually, it could be in 5 too, because the feedback only says wrong position, not that it can't be in 5. But note: the feedback for R says ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, position 5 is available because it was not tried for R. However, E was in position 5 and we know E is present but not in position 5? No: wait, the feedback for E says it is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1,2,3,4? And similarly, R can be in positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, positions 1,3,4 are common for both? Let me clarify:

The secret word has letters: R and E (and three others) and excludes C, A, N.

We must avoid:
- Using C, A, N anywhere.
- Placing R in position 2 (since that was wrong).
- Placing E in position 5 (since that was wrong).

We also don't know the other letters. We need to choose a word that includes R and E, and avoids C,A,N.

Common letters: Let's try to pick a word that includes other common letters like T, O, I, L, S, etc.

Since R is present, we can try words that start with R? Or have R in another spot.

Also, note that the secret word doesn't have A, so words with A should be avoided.

Let me think of words that include R and E, and without C,A,N.

Possible candidates:

1. Words starting with R: But we don't know if R is first. But we can try? However, we should avoid having R in position 2? Actually, for our next guess, we can put R anywhere except position 2? Or we could? Actually, we can put R anywhere we have not yet ruled out. The feedback tells us only that position 2 is incorrect for R. So R could be in 1,3,4,5? But note: we also have E that must be placed not in position 5.

But wait: the secret word has E somewhere else? So in our next guess, we don't want to put E in position 5 again? Actually, we are allowed, but it might give redundant information? So we should avoid placing E in position 5 because we already know it's not there? Similarly, we should avoid placing R in position 2.

So for our second guess, let's avoid:
- Putting R in position 2
- Putting E in position 5

Also, the word must not contain C, A, N.

We have to guess a word that includes R and E? Actually, not necessarily? Wait no, we know R and E are in the word? Actually, from the feedback, R and E are present? So yes, they must be in the word? Therefore, every subsequent guess must include R and E? But we don't know how many times? So we assume they appear at least once.

Now, we also don't know any other letters.

We can try a word that uses other common letters? Like T, O, I, L, S.

Possible words:

Consider: ""ROTATE"" -> too long? We need 5 letters. And it has A? Which is ruled out? Also has T? But A is excluded? So no A allowed? So ""ROTATE"" has A? So not allowed.

Other words:

- ""STORE"": 
  - S, T, O, R, E.
  - Does it include R? Yes. E? Yes.
  - Avoids C, A, N? Yes.
  - Position: 
    - R is placed in position 4? And we are avoiding position 2? We are not placing R in position 2? Here R is in 4? That's new.
    - E is placed in position 5? But we must avoid? Because E is in position 5? But feedback on E said E(-) meaning it's present but not in position 5? So putting E in position 5 is not allowed? Actually, we can put it? But we already know that position 5 is wrong? So if we put it there, we expect a ""-"" if E is still in the word? But we know it is? So we might get a ""-"" again? Alternatively, we might get a ""x"" if the secret word had two E's and we haven't tried E in other positions? Actually, no: we know there's at least one E? But we should put E in a different position to try to find its correct spot? Therefore, we should avoid position 5? So let's not put E in position 5.

So avoid:
- Letters: C, A, N
- Position 2: R?
- Position 5: E?

Alternatively, we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4? And then we avoid R in position 2? Position 2 can be any letter? Actually, position 2 can be any letter? But R cannot be there? Only that R was in position 2 last time? So we can put E in position 2? Yes, because last time E was not in position 5? But we haven't tested position 2 for E? So yes, we can put E in position 2? But we know that R was in position 2? But R was taken as absent? Actually, no: R is present? But we put R in position 2? But the feedback said it's in the word but not in position 2? So we think R is not in position 2? And E? We don't know? Maybe E is in position 2? We don't know? It could be? So let's try to put E in a position we haven't tried? Currently, we tried E only in position 5? So positions 1,2,3,4? We can try one? Similarly, R: we tried in position 2? So we can try R in 1,3,4,5? But note: position 5? We also tried E in 5? So R can be in 5? Because E was tried in 5? So we can try.

But we might want to test different letters? We haven't tried? Also, we don't know if there might be other letters? So let's choose a word that uses new common letters? Such as T, O, I, L, S.

Possible words:

- ""tires"": T, I, R, E, S -> no C,A,N? Yes. E is in position 4? Not 5. R is in position 3? Not 2? So good! But wait: positions?
  - T in 1st
  - I in 2nd -> we don't know? We don't have info? But we haven't ruled out? 
  - R in 3rd: not 2nd? Previously R was in 2nd? So now we are trying R in 3rd? Which is new.
  - E in 4th? Previously E was in 5th? Now we are trying E in 4th? Which is new.

Alternative: ""robes""? But it has B? Maybe? Also, E in position 5? We wanted to avoid? 
- robes: R, O, B, E, S -> E in position 5? Avoid? So better avoid position 5 for E? 

So ""tires"" seems good? But let me see: what common letters we cover? 
It includes T, I, R, E, S? That's 5 distinct letters? And we exclude C,A,N? Also, we are testing S? Which is common? 

Another option: ""stern"": 
S, T, E, R, N -> but N is excluded? We can't because N was marked as absent? So ""tires"" doesn't have N? Good? 

Also, ""slope"": S, L, O, P, E? But it doesn't include R? We know R must be in the word? Why? Because R was marked as present? And we haven't found the word? So we must include R? Otherwise, we might not get information? However, if we don't include R, then if the new guess has no R and we get feedback that shows R is there? Actually, the feedback will tell us? But we are trying to guess quickly? And we know R is in? So we must include R? Similarly E?

Therefore, in the second guess, we must include both R and E? Yes? Because we know they are present? And also avoid C,A,N? 

We can try ""tries"": T, R, I, E, S? 
This word has R in position 2? But wait: we must avoid putting R in position 2? Because last time R was in position 2? And the feedback said it's present but not in that position? Therefore, putting R in position 2 again? Then the feedback would say ""-"" again? And we learned nothing new? So that wastes a slot? So we should avoid putting R in position 2? Similarly, avoid E in position 5? 

So ""tries"": Positions? 
1: T? 
2: R? -> but we are putting R in position 2? Which we already know is wrong? We expect a ""-"" again? 
3: I? 
4: E? 
5: S? 

We are avoiding E in position 5? But here E is in position 4? So that's okay? But R is in position 2? Which we shouldn't? Actually, we have to avoid position 2 for R? So we cannot use ""tries"" because we are repeating a known wrong position? We want to rule out new positions? So we avoid?

Therefore, ""tires"": 
1: T? 
2: I? 
3: R? -> not in position 2? So new position? 
4: E? -> not in position 5? So new position? 
5: S? 

So that's good? 

Alternatively, ""resit"": 
1: R? 
2: E? -> but we haven't tested position 2? We know R was wrong in 2? But E? We haven't tested E in 2? So we can? But is it a real word? I think RESIT is valid? 

But let me think: We know R is present? Putting R in position 1? We don't know if that's correct? Similarly? 

But we have two positions: R can be in 1,3,4,5? And E in 1,2,3,4? 

If we put R in 1? Then we might get ✓? Or -? Or x if by mistake? But we know R is in? So ✓ or -? 

Similarly, for E? 

In ""resit"": 
R in 1? 
E in 2? 
S in 3? 
I in 4? 
T in 5? 

We avoid: 
- Letters: C,A,N? Yes? 
- R not in 2? Yes? 
- E not in 5? Yes? 

So we are testing R in position 1 and E in position 2? Both new? 

But which one is better? 
We get to test two new positions? 

Alternatively, ""store"": 
S, T, O, R, E -> 
R in position 4? 
E in position 5? But we avoid E in position 5? So that doesn't help? Therefore, we skip.

So between ""tires"" and ""resit""? Both are valid?

Another candidate: ""arise""? But has A? Ruled out? Not allowed.

""opera""? Has O,P,E,R,A? A? Excluded? So not allowed.

""house"": H,O,U,S,E? Doesn't have R? So we don't include R? Then the feedback for R? We know R is in the word? So if we don't include R? We get a problem? The feedback will tell us that R is still missing? Meaning? For each letter? So if we don't include R? Then the position where we don't have R? But for letters? We get feedback for each letter? Specifically? For ""house"", 
H: new? 
O: new? 
U: new? 
S: new? 
E: and E? We know E? But position? E is in position 5? Which we already tested? And was wrong? So we put E again in 5? So we expect ""-"" for E? Because in wrong position? Because we know E is in the word but position 5 is wrong? So we expect ""-""? 
And R? We didn't include? So the feedback would say:
- For H: could be ✓, - , or x? 
Similarly for O,U,S? 
Then for E: might be ""-"" again? 
But we didn't test R? So what? We know R is present? So we need to include R? Otherwise, we won't get information about R's position? 

Therefore, we must include R? And E? Because they are confirmed? 

So words without R? Are wasted? Similarly without E? 

Therefore, we stick to including both? 

So let me choose: 
I am thinking of ""resit""? Which has R and E? 

But note: the word might have double letters? We don't know? 

But for now? 

Actually, ""tires"" is the same letters as ""tries""? But in different order? Without repeating known wrong positions? 

Summary of candidates:

1. ""tires"": 
   - T, I, R, E, S 
   - R in pos 3 (new) 
   - E in pos 4 (new) 

2. ""resit"": 
   - R in pos 1 (new) 
   - E in pos 2 (new) 

Which one is better? 

I am inclined to ""tires""? Because position 1 has T? Which is a common letter? And position 2 has I? Which is common vowel? But also ""resit"" has R as first? which is less common? Actually, many words start with T? 

Another candidate: ""stern"": but has N? Not allowed? 

""brize""? Not a common word? 

So I'll go with ""tires"". 

It avoids C,A,N and puts R and E in new positions? 

Also, letters T, I, S? Are new? Common? 

So let's guess ""tires"". 

But wait: we haven't tried position 1? Position 2? etc? 

Also, if the secret word has I? Then we might find? 

I think it's a good guess? 

Therefore, second guess: <guess>tires</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x""), so they must be avoided.
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked with ""-"").
- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include both R and E (as they are confirmed present) but place R anywhere except position 2 and E anywhere except position 5.
- Avoid C, A, and N entirely.
- Introduce new common letters (like T, I, S) to test additional potential positions.

A strong choice is **""tires""** because:
- It contains R (placed in position 3, a new untested position) and E (placed in position 4, avoiding position 5).
- It avoids C, A, and N.
- It introduces new common letters: T in position 1, I in position 2, and S in position 5 (all not tested before).

This strategically maximizes information gain by testing R and E in new positions while covering new high-frequency letters.

<guess>tires</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tires -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C, A, N: absent.
- R: present but not in position 2 (so in position 1, 3, or 4? But note: positions are 1-based? Actually, in the example: BRISK and STORM: S is position 1? So ""crane"": C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5). Feedback: R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. E(-) meaning E is in the word but not in position 5.

Second guess: ""tires"" -> T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
Interpretation:
- T: absent (x) -> so T is not in the word.
- I: absent (x) -> so I is not in the word.
- R: present but not in position 3 (because R was guessed in position 3? ""tires"": T(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), S(5). Feedback: R(-) so R is present but not in position 3.
- E: correct! (✓) in position 4. So E is in the secret word at position 4.
- S: present but not in position 5. So S is in the word but not in position 5.

Now, we have:
- The secret word contains: R (present), E (correct at position 4), S (present).
- Additional letters: we know E is at position 4.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N (from first guess), T, I (from second guess).
- Also note: we have information about positions for R and S.

Specifically:
- R is present but:
  - Not in position 2 (from ""crane"")
  - Not in position 3 (from ""tires"")
  - And since E is at position 4, R cannot be there? R can be in positions 1 or 5? Because remaining positions are 1, 5? Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. E is fixed at 4? So R must be in one of 1,5? Actually, also? What about position 2 and 3 we know R is not? And position 4 is E? So R must be either in position 1 or position 5? Unless there are multiple letters? But we haven't had any indication? But we don't know? There might be two R's? But let's assume no duplicates? Typically? We might need to consider? But for now? 

Similarly, S:
- From ""crane"": we tried S? Actually, we didn't? ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E? No S? So first time we see S? Then ""tires"" had S at position 5? Feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not at position 5? So S must be in positions 1,2,3? But note: position 4 is taken by E? So available positions: 1,2,3? And R is also to be placed in either 1 or 5? But S? So they might share? Actually, S could be in 1,2, or 3? And R in 1 or 5? So conflict? Only at position 1? That is, if R is in 1, then S cannot be in 1? So S must be in 2 or 3? And if R is in 5, then S in 1,2,3 anywhere? 

Currently, we don't know the fifth letter? We have: 
- Position 4: E (locked)
- R must be in 1 or 5?
- S in 2,3? Or if R in 5 then S in 1,2,3? But we also have two other letters? We know the secret word has 5 distinct? Actually, we don't know? Some words have repeated letters? But let's avoid assuming? 

Known letters: 
- R: present (in 1 or 5)
- S: present (in wherever) and not in 5? 
- E: at 4.
- And we know the word has two more letters? Because we haven't found all? 

Excluded? Total excluded: C, A, N, T, I.

Also, we must avoid using these?

We need to guess a word that:
1. Must include R and S (they are present).
2. Must have E at position 4.
3. Avoids C,A,N,T,I.
4. Must have two more letters? And we don't know? 

Furthermore, we have constraints on R and S positions:
- R: must not be in position 2 or 3? And since position 4 is E? So only options: position 1 or 5? 
- S: must not be in position 5? And we haven't tried positions 1,2,3? So S must be in 1,2, or 3? But if R is in position 1, then S must be in 2 or 3? If R in 5, S can be in 1,2,3? 

We also would like to test other positions?

We don't know the fifth (third) letter? And another letter? We know the secret word has 5 letters? We have E fixed? And R? And S? And two more? So two unknowns?

We need to guess a word that fits these constraints? 

Let's look for words with pattern: 
- Position 4: E
- Position 1: either R or something else? But if R is in 1? Then word starts with R? Or if not? 

Possible words:

Consider R at position 1? Then S in 2 or 3? 

Options:
R at 1, E at 4: 
- Words like: R? ? E? E? 
But we have S? 

For example: 
ROSE? But O? And S? Position 5 must be something? 
R O S E? Wait: positions: 
1: R? 
2: O? 
3: S? 
4: E? 
5: ? But we have S at position 3? Then the fifth letter? Also, let's see: does it avoid C,A,N,T,I? Yes? Then what? 
But we haven't fixed the fifth letter? 

Other words: R with E at fourth? 

But alternatively, R at position 5? Then the word ends with R? And position 4 is E? So ...E R? 

Now, we want to test positions? Also, we haven't tested letters? 

Common letters remaining? Excluding C,A,N,T,I? Remaining letters: 
B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common letters? For example: O, L, U, P, etc. 

Let's try to form words:

Case 1: R in position 1? Then S in position 2 or 3? 
- If S in position 2: R S ? E ? 
- Possibilities: R S _ E _ ? 
  Words: R S (letter) E (letter) -> RS?E?
  Possible: ROSE (but O is in? But O? Then E? Then? Wait: R O S E -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E -> but in this, S is at position 3? Then fifth letter? ROSE? Not 5 letters? Wait, ROSE is 4? But 5-letter words: ROSED? Not valid? 
  Actually: ROBES? But we avoid B? Maybe? Or wait, we haven't ruled out? 

But let's search:
Possible words: 
- ""ROLES"": 
  1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S? -> but we know S? And we have S at position 5? But S cannot be in position 5? Because from ""tires"", S was at 5 and feedback said - meaning wrong position? So position 5 is invalid for S? Therefore, if R at 1? We cannot have S at 5? 

Also, ""tires"" feedback: S(-) meaning S is not at 5? So in any guess? We avoid S in position 5? 

Therefore, for R in 1? We must put S in 2 or 3? 

If R in 1, S in 2: pattern R S ? E ? 
Possible words? 
RS?E? 
Examples: 
- R S ? E ? 
""rs"" are rare? Maybe ""ruse""? But we know E at 4? So R U S E ...? Wait: position 4 is E? And E must be at 4? So R S ? E ? 
So positions: 1:R,2:S,3:?,4:E,5:? 
Then the word? Must be 5 letters? Valid: RSLEE? Not valid? ""rise""? Wait: ""rise"" is 4 letters? 
We need 5-letter words? 
For 1:R,2:S,3:?,4:E,5:? 
Valid words? 
- ""RUSES"": But S appears twice? And at position 5? Also S? But already excluded? 
Or ""RASED"": But A? Excluded? 
""RUSLE"": Not valid? 
Perhaps no common words? 

Alternatively: R at 1, S at position 3: pattern R ? S E ? 
Examples: 
1:R,2:?,3:S,4:E,5:? 
Valid words: 
- ""ROUSE"": R O U S E -> yes? 
Letters: O,U -> not excluded? 
Also, ""REUSE"": R E U S E -> but E repeated? And E is at position 2? Duplicated E? Then for position 2: E? But the secret word? We know E is at position 4? But there might be two E? 
Actually, the feedback might show? 
But let's see if it's possible? 

Similarly, ""raise"": has A? Excluded? 
""rouse"": R O U S E -> 
1:R,2:O,3:U,4:S? Wait, S? But we need E at 4? And S at position? 
- Actually: ""rouse"": R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> no E at 4? That doesn't work? 
We need E at 4? So ""rouse""? Cannot? 

How about ""RESET""? But R at 1? Position 4: E? So R E S E T? 
1:R, 2:E, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T? 
But T is excluded? 
Not valid? 

Another word: ""RIPES""? I excluded? 

So perhaps none without excluded letters? 

Alternative: R at position 5? Pattern: ? ? ? E R? 
Then S? Can be at 1,2,3? 

Pattern: _ _ _ E R? 
And S must be in 1,2,3? 

Now, words: ... E R? 

Examples: 
- ""__SER"" -> then S at position 3? 
  For example: ""POSER"", ""LOSER"", ""HOSER"", ""ROGER"" is R O G E R -> repeated R? Duplicated R? But we don't know if possible? 
But R? We must include R? And if R is at 5? Then there is only one R? 
So words must have S somewhere? And E at 4? R at 5? 

Pattern: _ _ S E R? 
Then first two letters: two more letters? For example: ""PASER"" -> has A? Excluded? 
""USER"" -> but 4 letters? 
5-letter: ""HOSER"": H O S E R -> 
Positions: 
1: H? 
2: O? 
3: S? 
4: E? 
5: R? 
This works? 
Avoids C,A,N,T,I? Yes? 
And R is at position 5? Which is allowed? 
S is at position 3? Which is not 5? So okay? 
But we haven't tried O and H before? 

Alternatively: S at position 1: pattern S _ _ E R? 
Words: ""S_ _ER"" 
Examples: ""SOWER"", ""SUPER"", ""SABER"" (has A? excluded), ""SHEER"" (double E? and E at 4 but also other E?), ""SHOER""? Not common? 

S at position 2: pattern _ S ? E R? 
For example: ""ASPER"" (has A? excluded), ""ISLER""? Not common? 

So ""HOSER"" seems good? 

But let me see: common letters? 

Another pattern: without S? But we must include S? Wait? 

We know:
- R must be in 1 or 5?
- E at 4?
- S must be in 1,2,3? Except if R in 1? Then S cannot in 1? 

But also, we don't know the other letters? 

We can also consider: maybe S is the other possible position? 

But let me try: we need to guess? And there is also the possibility that R is in position 1? And we haven't found? 

Maybe we can try a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to commit? 

Another idea: we know the word has S? But not found? 

We can try ""loser"": L O S E R -> 
Positions: 
1: L? 
2: O? 
3: S? 
4: E? 
5: R? 
Pattern: S at position 3? And R at 5? 
Avoids all forbidden letters? 

But is it valid? Yes? 
Also, ""loser"" avoids C,A,N,T,I? 

Similarly, we can use ""homer"": H O M E R? 
But E at 4? R at 5? 
S? Where? Doesn't include S? Then feedback? We know S must be in the word? Why? Because we had ""tires"" guess? S(-)? So S must be in the word? So if we don't include S? Then feedback? We would get S missing? But we know S is present? So we must include S? 

Therefore, ""loser"" has S? At position 3? 

""loser"": L,O,S,E,R -> yes? 
So: 
- Position 3: S? Which we haven't tried? 
- Position 5: R? Which we tried? But we know R is present? And we are testing a new position? Because R was not tried in 5? 

Previously? We tried R only in positions 2 and 3? And wrong? And E is known at 4? 
So R in 5 is untested? 

Also, S? Tried in position 5? Found wrong? But now S in 3? Untested? And we expect S to be there? Maybe? 

Common word? Yes? 

Alternatively? Another word: ""muser"": M U S E R? 
Also? 

But ""loser"" is more common? 

Another: ""poser"": P O S E R? 

All valid? 

Now? Which one to choose? 

We can choose ""loser""? It includes L and O? New letters? 

Also? Notice: in ""tires"", we have E at 4? That was correct? So we can rely? 

Therefore, guess ""loser""? 

But we have R at 5? And S at 3? 

Also? If it's not? We get feedback? 

Another candidate: if R is in position 1? Then we need S in 2 or 3? And E at 4? 

For example: word ""robed""? But we avoid? Or ""rubel""? Not common? 

""RISEN""? Has I? Excluded? 

""RESOD""? R E S O D? Then: 1:R,2:E,3:S,4:O,5:D? But E at 4? But we have E at 4? Fixed? So position 2:E? Then? 
Wait? Our pattern? If R at 1? Then we can have E at 4? But position 2? We haven't tested for E? Actually, we know E is at 4? So position 2 should not be E? Because E is only at 4? We don't know? In secret word? E is only at 4? Or could be elsewhere? Actually, the feedback? For ""crane"": E(-) meaning E is present but not at 5? Then for ""tires"": E(✓) at 4? That's correct? So E is fixed at 4? And there are no other E? So we must not put E elsewhere? 

Therefore, any word must have E only at position 4? 

Therefore, for R at position 1? We cannot have E at 2? 

Similarly? 

So pattern for R at 1: 
1:R, 2:?, 3: (S or ?) ,4:E, 5:? 
And S must be in 2 or 3? If in 3: R ? S E ? 
Valid? 
1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:P? ""rosep""? Not valid? 
1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:M? ""rosem""? No? 
1:R, 2:U, 3:S, 4:E, 5:D? ""rused""? Not common? 
But ""ruse""? Is 4 letters? 
How about ""RUSES""? But S twice? And E at 4? So R U S E S? Then positions: 
1:R,2:U,3:S,4:E,5:S -> but S at 3 and 5? But from ""tires"", we have S? And we know S? So if we use duplicate? Then feedback? 

But for now? We assume no duplicate? Because we haven't seen? 

Actually? We don't know? 

But common words? 

Therefore? The better bet seems R in 5? And we choose ""loser""? 

Additionally? We could try ""poser""? P O S E R? 

But why? 

Also? Note? We haven't used P,O,L? 

Now? Both ""loser"" and ""poser"" are valid? 

But let's choose? 

Actually? There is another constraint: the word must not contain any excluded letters? 

So? 

I think ""loser"" is good? 

Therefore? Third guess: loser

But wait? The word ""loser""? It includes L, O, S, E, R? 
S is at position 3? And we haven't tested S? And R at 5? 

Expected feedback? 

If the secret word? For example? 

Perhaps? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that rules out the other possibility? But it's fine? 

Let me try? 

So guess? ""loser""? 

But wait? Another word: ""SUPER""? But it starts with S? Pattern S _ _ E R? 
If S at 1? Then word: S U P E R? 
Positions: 
1:S? 
2: ? 
3:? 
4:E? 
5:R? 
Now? In this? S at first? Which hasn't been tested? 
R at last? 
But U and P? 

Also? Avoids excluded letters? 

But we know? From ""tires"", I was excluded? 

Now? ""SUPER""? S,U,P,E,R? 

But P? Not tested? 

But? Also? R at 5? 

Compared to ""loser""? L,O,S,E,R? 

Both seem fine? 

Perhaps ""super"" is shorter? 

But? Actually? Let me see? 

But? We also need to consider: in ""loser""? Position 3:S? And position 5:R? 

In ""super""? Position 1:S? Then? 

We could? But? 

But? By guessing ""loser""? Or ""super""? 

But? We have? 

I think we can go with ""loser"". 

Therefore: 

<guess>loser</guess> 

But? Let's double-check? 

Summary: 
- Positions: We know position 4 must be E? 
- R: must be in 1 or 5? 
- S: must be in 1,2,3? 
- Avoid C,A,N,T,I? 

In ""loser"": 
- Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:R 
- We are testing R in position 5? (and also S in position 3) 

If the secret word has R in 5? Then we might get R✓? Or if not? Then wrong? 

We'll see? 

Alternatively? If R is not in 5? Then we learn that R must be in 1? 

But? For this guess? 

Yes? 

So? 

I choose ""loser"". 

But? We still have to write? 

Note: We must include all? 

Actually? Let me list the known? 

Perhaps? There are other constraints? 

In the second guess ""tires""? We learned E(✓) at 4? 

Also? R(-) at 3? 

Now? 

We are guessing? 

I think? 

Therefore? 

Final guess: loser### Reasoning for the Next Guess

We have two previous guesses with feedback:

1. **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
   - `C`, `A`, `N` are absent from the secret word.  
   - `R` is present but not in position 2.  
   - `E` is present but not in position 5.  

2. **Guess 2: tires → Feedback: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)**  
   - `T` and `I` are absent.  
   - `R` is present but not in position 3.  
   - `E` is correct and fixed in position 4!  
   - `S` is present but not in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters:**  
  - `E` is locked at position 4.  
  - `R` and `S` are present in the word.
- **Absent letters:** `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I` must be avoided.  
- **Position constraints for `R`:**  
  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or 3 (from ""tires"").  
  - Since position 4 is occupied by `E`, `R` must be in position 1 or 5 (*no duplicates inferred yet*).  
- **Position constraints for `S`:**  
  - Cannot be in position 5 (from ""tires"").  
  - Must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
- **Unknowns:** Two letters remain unknown (besides `E`, `R`, `S`), with no duplicates implied.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include `R` and `S`:** Both are confirmed present.  
- **Position `R` correctly:** Prioritize testing `R` in position 1 or 5 to resolve its location.  
- **Position `S` strategically:** Place `S` in an untested position (1, 2, or 3), avoiding position 5.  
- **Introduce new, common letters:** Test high-frequency consonants/vowels not yet evaluated (e.g., `L`, `O`, `M`) to gather more information.  
- **Avoid guessing `R` in position 5 if `S` is in position 1:** Both letters share possible positions, but feedback will clarify conflicts.  

Ideal word suggestions:
- **`loser`**:  
  - `L` (position 1), `O` (position 2), `S` (position 3), `E` (position 4), `R` (position 5).  
  - Tests `R` in position 5 and `S` in position 3 (both new positions).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (`C`/`A`/`N`/`T`/`I`).  
  - Introduces `L` and `O` for additional coverage.  
- **Alternative: `poser` or `super`**  
  - Similar pattern but less common letters; `loser` is prioritized as it follows the constraints elegantly.

### Why `loser`?
- If correct: Wins the game (but unlikely this early).  
- If partial: Feedback on `R` (position 5) will confirm if `R` belongs at the end or start (position 1).  
- Feedback on `S` (position 3) and new letters (`L`, `O`) will simplify next guesses.

Actually, it could be in 5 too, because the feedback only says wrong position, not that it can\'t be in 5. But note: the feedback for R says ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, position 5 is available because it was not tried for R. However, E was in position 5 and we know E is present but not in position 5? No: wait, the feedback for E says it is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1,2,3,4? And similarly, R can be in positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, positions 1,3,4 are common for both? Let me clarify:\n\nThe secret word has letters: R and E (and three others) and excludes C, A, N.\n\nWe must avoid:\n- Using C, A, N anywhere.\n- Placing R in position 2 (since that was wrong).\n- Placing E in position 5 (since that was wrong).\n\nWe also don\'t know the other letters. We need to choose a word that includes R and E, and avoids C,A,N.\n\nCommon letters: Let\'s try to pick a word that includes other common letters like T, O, I, L, S, etc.\n\nSince R is present, we can try words that start with R? Or have R in another spot.\n\nAlso, note that the secret word doesn\'t have A, so words with A should be avoided.\n\nLet me think of words that include R and E, and without C,A,N.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n1. Words starting with R: But we don\'t know if R is first. But we can try? However, we should avoid having R in position 2? Actually, for our next guess, we can put R anywhere except position 2? Or we could? Actually, we can put R anywhere we have not yet ruled out. The feedback tells us only that position 2 is incorrect for R. So R could be in 1,3,4,5? But note: we also have E that must be placed not in position 5.\n\nBut wait: the secret word has E somewhere else? So in our next guess, we don\'t want to put E in position 5 again? Actually, we are allowed, but it might give redundant information? So we should avoid placing E in position 5 because we already know it\'s not there? Similarly, we should avoid placing R in position 2.\n\nSo for our second guess, let\'s avoid:\n- Putting R in position 2\n- Putting E in position 5\n\nAlso, the word must not contain C, A, N.\n\nWe have to guess a word that includes R and E? Actually, not necessarily? Wait no, we know R and E are in the word? Actually, from the feedback, R and E are present? So yes, they must be in the word? Therefore, every subsequent guess must include R and E? But we don\'t know how many times? So we assume they appear at least once.\n\nNow, we also don\'t know any other letters.\n\nWe can try a word that uses other common letters? Like T, O, I, L, S.\n\nPossible words:\n\nConsider: ""ROTATE"" -> too long? We need 5 letters. And it has A? Which is ruled out? Also has T? But A is excluded? So no A allowed? So ""ROTATE"" has A? So not allowed.\n\nOther words:\n\n- ""STORE"": \n  - S, T, O, R, E.\n  - Does it include R? Yes. E? Yes.\n  - Avoids C, A, N? Yes.\n  - Position: \n    - R is placed in position 4? And we are avoiding position 2? We are not placing R in position 2? Here R is in 4? That\'s new.\n    - E is placed in position 5? But we must avoid? Because E is in position 5? But feedback on E said E(-) meaning it\'s present but not in position 5? So putting E in position 5 is not allowed? Actually, we can put it? But we already know that position 5 is wrong? So if we put it there, we expect a ""-"" if E is still in the word? But we know it is? So we might get a ""-"" again? Alternatively, we might get a ""x"" if the secret word had two E\'s and we haven\'t tried E in other positions? Actually, no: we know there\'s at least one E? But we should put E in a different position to try to find its correct spot? Therefore, we should avoid position 5? So let\'s not put E in position 5.\n\nSo avoid:\n- Letters: C, A, N\n- Position 2: R?\n- Position 5: E?\n\nAlternatively, we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4? And then we avoid R in position 2? Position 2 can be any letter? Actually, position 2 can be any letter? But R cannot be there? Only that R was in position 2 last time? So we can put E in position 2? Yes, because last time E was not in position 5? But we haven\'t tested position 2 for E? So yes, we can put E in position 2? But we know that R was in position 2? But R was taken as absent? Actually, no: R is present? But we put R in position 2? But the feedback said it\'s in the word but not in position 2? So we think R is not in position 2? And E? We don\'t know? Maybe E is in position 2? We don\'t know? It could be? So let\'s try to put E in a position we haven\'t tried? Currently, we tried E only in position 5? So positions 1,2,3,4? We can try one? Similarly, R: we tried in position 2? So we can try R in 1,3,4,5? But note: position 5? We also tried E in 5? So R can be in 5? Because E was tried in 5? So we can try.\n\nBut we might want to test different letters? We haven\'t tried? Also, we don\'t know if there might be other letters? So let\'s choose a word that uses new common letters? Such as T, O, I, L, S.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""tires"": T, I, R, E, S -> no C,A,N? Yes. E is in position 4? Not 5. R is in position 3? Not 2? So good! But wait: positions?\n  - T in 1st\n  - I in 2nd -> we don\'t know? We don\'t have info? But we haven\'t ruled out? \n  - R in 3rd: not 2nd? Previously R was in 2nd? So now we are trying R in 3rd? Which is new.\n  - E in 4th? Previously E was in 5th? Now we are trying E in 4th? Which is new.\n\nAlternative: ""robes""? But it has B? Maybe? Also, E in position 5? We wanted to avoid? \n- robes: R, O, B, E, S -> E in position 5? Avoid? So better avoid position 5 for E? \n\nSo ""tires"" seems good? But let me see: what common letters we cover? \nIt includes T, I, R, E, S? That\'s 5 distinct letters? And we exclude C,A,N? Also, we are testing S? Which is common? \n\nAnother option: ""stern"": \nS, T, E, R, N -> but N is excluded? We can\'t because N was marked as absent? So ""tires"" doesn\'t have N? Good? \n\nAlso, ""slope"": S, L, O, P, E? But it doesn\'t include R? We know R must be in the word? Why? Because R was marked as present? And we haven\'t found the word? So we must include R? Otherwise, we might not get information? However, if we don\'t include R, then if the new guess has no R and we get feedback that shows R is there? Actually, the feedback will tell us? But we are trying to guess quickly? And we know R is in? So we must include R? Similarly E?\n\nTherefore, in the second guess, we must include both R and E? Yes? Because we know they are present? And also avoid C,A,N? \n\nWe can try ""tries"": T, R, I, E, S? \nThis word has R in position 2? But wait: we must avoid putting R in position 2? Because last time R was in position 2? And the feedback said it\'s present but not in that position? Therefore, putting R in position 2 again? Then the feedback would say ""-"" again? And we learned nothing new? So that wastes a slot? So we should avoid putting R in position 2? Similarly, avoid E in position 5? \n\nSo ""tries"": Positions? \n1: T? \n2: R? -> but we are putting R in position 2? Which we already know is wrong? We expect a ""-"" again? \n3: I? \n4: E? \n5: S? \n\nWe are avoiding E in position 5? But here E is in position 4? So that\'s okay? But R is in position 2? Which we shouldn\'t? Actually, we have to avoid position 2 for R? So we cannot use ""tries"" because we are repeating a known wrong position? We want to rule out new positions? So we avoid?\n\nTherefore, ""tires"": \n1: T? \n2: I? \n3: R? -> not in position 2? So new position? \n4: E? -> not in position 5? So new position? \n5: S? \n\nSo that\'s good? \n\nAlternatively, ""resit"": \n1: R? \n2: E? -> but we haven\'t tested position 2? We know R was wrong in 2? But E? We haven\'t tested E in 2? So we can? But is it a real word? I think RESIT is valid? \n\nBut let me think: We know R is present? Putting R in position 1? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? Similarly? \n\nBut we have two positions: R can be in 1,3,4,5? And E in 1,2,3,4? \n\nIf we put R in 1? Then we might get ✓? Or -? Or x if by mistake? But we know R is in? So ✓ or -? \n\nSimilarly, for E? \n\nIn ""resit"": \nR in 1? \nE in 2? \nS in 3? \nI in 4? \nT in 5? \n\nWe avoid: \n- Letters: C,A,N? Yes? \n- R not in 2? Yes? \n- E not in 5? Yes? \n\nSo we are testing R in position 1 and E in position 2? Both new? \n\nBut which one is better? \nWe get to test two new positions? \n\nAlternatively, ""store"": \nS, T, O, R, E -> \nR in position 4? \nE in position 5? But we avoid E in position 5? So that doesn\'t help? Therefore, we skip.\n\nSo between ""tires"" and ""resit""? Both are valid?\n\nAnother candidate: ""arise""? But has A? Ruled out? Not allowed.\n\n""opera""? Has O,P,E,R,A? A? Excluded? So not allowed.\n\n""house"": H,O,U,S,E? Doesn\'t have R? So we don\'t include R? Then the feedback for R? We know R is in the word? So if we don\'t include R? We get a problem? The feedback will tell us that R is still missing? Meaning? For each letter? So if we don\'t include R? Then the position where we don\'t have R? But for letters? We get feedback for each letter? Specifically? For ""house"", \nH: new? \nO: new? \nU: new? \nS: new? \nE: and E? We know E? But position? E is in position 5? Which we already tested? And was wrong? So we put E again in 5? So we expect ""-"" for E? Because in wrong position? Because we know E is in the word but position 5 is wrong? So we expect ""-""? \nAnd R? We didn\'t include? So the feedback would say:\n- For H: could be ✓, - , or x? \nSimilarly for O,U,S? \nThen for E: might be ""-"" again? \nBut we didn\'t test R? So what? We know R is present? So we need to include R? Otherwise, we won\'t get information about R\'s position? \n\nTherefore, we must include R? And E? Because they are confirmed? \n\nSo words without R? Are wasted? Similarly without E? \n\nTherefore, we stick to including both? \n\nSo let me choose: \nI am thinking of ""resit""? Which has R and E? \n\nBut note: the word might have double letters? We don\'t know? \n\nBut for now? \n\nActually, ""tires"" is the same letters as ""tries""? But in different order? Without repeating known wrong positions? \n\nSummary of candidates:\n\n1. ""tires"": \n   - T, I, R, E, S \n   - R in pos 3 (new) \n   - E in pos 4 (new) \n\n2. ""resit"": \n   - R in pos 1 (new) \n   - E in pos 2 (new) \n\nWhich one is better? \n\nI am inclined to ""tires""? Because position 1 has T? Which is a common letter? And position 2 has I? Which is common vowel? But also ""resit"" has R as first? which is less common? Actually, many words start with T? \n\nAnother candidate: ""stern"": but has N? Not allowed? \n\n""brize""? Not a common word? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""tires"". \n\nIt avoids C,A,N and puts R and E in new positions? \n\nAlso, letters T, I, S? Are new? Common? \n\nSo let\'s guess ""tires"". \n\nBut wait: we haven\'t tried position 1? Position 2? etc? \n\nAlso, if the secret word has I? Then we might find? \n\nI think it\'s a good guess? \n\nTherefore, second guess: <guess>tires</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x""), so they must be avoided.\n- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked with ""-"").\n- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked with ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must include both R and E (as they are confirmed present) but place R anywhere except position 2 and E anywhere except position 5.\n- Avoid C, A, and N entirely.\n- Introduce new common letters (like T, I, S) to test additional potential positions.\n\nA strong choice is **""tires""** because:\n- It contains R (placed in position 3, a new untested position) and E (placed in position 4, avoiding position 5).\n- It avoids C, A, and N.\n- It introduces new common letters: T in position 1, I in position 2, and S in position 5 (all not tested before).\n\nThis strategically maximizes information gain by testing R and E in new positions while covering new high-frequency letters.\n\n<guess>tires</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tires -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nInterpretation:\n- C, A, N: absent.\n- R: present but not in position 2 (so in position 1, 3, or 4?

R can be in positions 1 or 5? Because remaining positions are 1, 5? Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. E is fixed at 4? So R must be in one of 1,5? Actually, also? What about position 2 and 3 we know R is not? And position 4 is E? So R must be either in position 1 or position 5? Unless there are multiple letters? But we haven\'t had any indication? But we don\'t know? There might be two R\'s? But let\'s assume no duplicates? Typically? We might need to consider? But for now? \n\nSimilarly, S:\n- From ""crane"": we tried S? Actually, we didn\'t? ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E? No S? So first time we see S? Then ""tires"" had S at position 5? Feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not at position 5? So S must be in positions 1,2,3? But note: position 4 is taken by E? So available positions: 1,2,3? And R is also to be placed in either 1 or 5? But S? So they might share? Actually, S could be in 1,2, or 3? And R in 1 or 5? So conflict? Only at position 1? That is, if R is in 1, then S cannot be in 1? So S must be in 2 or 3? And if R is in 5, then S in 1,2,3 anywhere? \n\nCurrently, we don\'t know the fifth letter? We have: \n- Position 4: E (locked)\n- R must be in 1 or 5?\n- S in 2,3? Or if R in 5 then S in 1,2,3? But we also have two other letters? We know the secret word has 5 distinct?

But let\'s avoid assuming? \n\nKnown letters: \n- R: present (in 1 or 5)\n- S: present (in wherever) and not in 5? \n- E: at 4.\n- And we know the word has two more letters? Because we haven\'t found all? \n\nExcluded? Total excluded: C, A, N, T, I.\n\nAlso, we must avoid using these?\n\nWe need to guess a word that:\n1. Must include R and S (they are present).\n2. Must have E at position 4.\n3. Avoids C,A,N,T,I.\n4. Must have two more letters? And we don\'t know? \n\nFurthermore, we have constraints on R and S positions:\n- R: must not be in position 2 or 3? And since position 4 is E? So only options: position 1 or 5? \n- S: must not be in position 5? And we haven\'t tried positions 1,2,3? So S must be in 1,2, or 3? But if R is in position 1, then S must be in 2 or 3? If R in 5, S can be in 1,2,3? \n\nWe also would like to test other positions?\n\nWe don\'t know the fifth (third) letter? And another letter? We know the secret word has 5 letters? We have E fixed? And R? And S? And two more? So two unknowns?\n\nWe need to guess a word that fits these constraints? \n\nLet\'s look for words with pattern: \n- Position 4: E\n- Position 1: either R or something else? But if R is in 1? Then word starts with R? Or if not? \n\nPossible words:\n\nConsider R at position 1? Then S in 2 or 3? \n\nOptions:\nR at 1, E at 4: \n- Words like: R? ? E? E? \nBut we have S? \n\nFor example: \nROSE? But O? And S? Position 5 must be something? \nR O S E? Wait: positions: \n1: R? \n2: O? \n3: S? \n4: E? \n5: ? But we have S at position 3? Then the fifth letter? Also, let\'s see: does it avoid C,A,N,T,I? Yes? Then what? \nBut we haven\'t fixed the fifth letter? \n\nOther words: R with E at fourth? \n\nBut alternatively, R at position 5? Then the word ends with R? And position 4 is E? So ...E R? \n\nNow, we want to test positions? Also, we haven\'t tested letters? \n\nCommon letters remaining? Excluding C,A,N,T,I? Remaining letters: \nB, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common letters? For example: O, L, U, P, etc. \n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nCase 1: R in position 1? Then S in position 2 or 3? \n- If S in position 2: R S ? E ? \n- Possibilities: R S _ E _ ? \n  Words: R S (letter) E (letter) -> RS?E?\n  Possible: ROSE (but O is in? But O? Then E? Then? Wait: R O S E -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E -> but in this, S is at position 3? Then fifth letter? ROSE? Not 5 letters? Wait, ROSE is 4? But 5-letter words: ROSED? Not valid? \n  Actually: ROBES? But we avoid B? Maybe? Or wait, we haven\'t ruled out? \n\nBut let\'s search:\nPossible words: \n- ""ROLES"": \n  1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S? -> but we know S? And we have S at position 5? But S cannot be in position 5? Because from ""tires"", S was at 5 and feedback said - meaning wrong position? So position 5 is invalid for S? Therefore, if R at 1? We cannot have S at 5? \n\nAlso, ""tires"" feedback: S(-) meaning S is not at 5? So in any guess? We avoid S in position 5? \n\nTherefore, for R in 1? We must put S in 2 or 3? \n\nIf R in 1, S in 2: pattern R S ? E ? \nPossible words? \nRS?E? \nExamples: \n- R S ? E ? \n""rs"" are rare? Maybe ""ruse""? But we know E at 4? So R U S E ...? Wait: position 4 is E? And E must be at 4? So R S ? E ? \nSo positions: 1:R,2:S,3:?,4:E,5:? \nThen the word? Must be 5 letters? Valid: RSLEE? Not valid? ""rise""? Wait: ""rise"" is 4 letters? \nWe need 5-letter words? \nFor 1:R,2:S,3:?,4:E,5:? \nValid words? \n- ""RUSES"": But S appears twice? And at position 5? Also S? But already excluded? \nOr ""RASED"": But A? Excluded? \n""RUSLE"": Not valid? \nPerhaps no common words? \n\nAlternatively: R at 1, S at position 3: pattern R ? S E ? \nExamples: \n1:R,2:?,3:S,4:E,5:? \nValid words: \n- ""ROUSE"": R O U S E -> yes? \nLetters: O,U -> not excluded? \nAlso, ""REUSE"": R E U S E -> but E repeated? And E is at position 2? Duplicated E? Then for position 2: E? But the secret word? We know E is at position 4? But there might be two E? \nActually, the feedback might show? \nBut let\'s see if it\'s possible? \n\nSimilarly, ""raise"": has A? Excluded? \n""rouse"": R O U S E -> \n1:R,2:O,3:U,4:S? Wait, S? But we need E at 4? And S at position? \n- Actually: ""rouse"": R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> no E at 4? That doesn\'t work? \nWe need E at 4? So ""rouse""? Cannot? \n\nHow about ""RESET""? But R at 1? Position 4: E? So R E S E T? \n1:R, 2:E, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T? \nBut T is excluded? \nNot valid? \n\nAnother word: ""RIPES""? I excluded? \n\nSo perhaps none without excluded letters? \n\nAlternative: R at position 5? Pattern: ? ? ? E R? \nThen S? Can be at 1,2,3? \n\nPattern: _ _ _ E R? \nAnd S must be in 1,2,3? \n\nNow, words: ... E R? \n\nExamples: \n- ""__SER"" -> then S at position 3? \n  For example: ""POSER"", ""LOSER"", ""HOSER"", ""ROGER"" is R O G E R -> repeated R? Duplicated R? But we don\'t know if possible? \nBut R? We must include R? And if R is at 5? Then there is only one R? \nSo words must have S somewhere? And E at 4? R at 5? \n\nPattern: _ _ S E R? \nThen first two letters: two more letters? For example: ""PASER"" -> has A? Excluded? \n""USER"" -> but 4 letters? \n5-letter: ""HOSER"": H O S E R -> \nPositions: \n1: H? \n2: O? \n3: S? \n4: E? \n5: R? \nThis works? \nAvoids C,A,N,T,I? Yes? \nAnd R is at position 5? Which is allowed? \nS is at position 3? Which is not 5? So okay? \nBut we haven\'t tried O and H before? \n\nAlternatively: S at position 1: pattern S _ _ E R? \nWords: ""S_ _ER"" \nExamples: ""SOWER"", ""SUPER"", ""SABER"" (has A? excluded), ""SHEER"" (double E? and E at 4 but also other E?), ""SHOER""? Not common? \n\nS at position 2: pattern _ S ? E R? \nFor example: ""ASPER"" (has A? excluded), ""ISLER""? Not common? \n\nSo ""HOSER"" seems good? \n\nBut let me see: common letters? \n\nAnother pattern: without S? But we must include S? Wait? \n\nWe know:\n- R must be in 1 or 5?\n- E at 4?\n- S must be in 1,2,3? Except if R in 1? Then S cannot in 1? \n\nBut also, we don\'t know the other letters? \n\nWe can also consider: maybe S is the other possible position? \n\nBut let me try: we need to guess? And there is also the possibility that R is in position 1? And we haven\'t found? \n\nMaybe we can try a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to commit? \n\nAnother idea: we know the word has S? But not found? \n\nWe can try ""loser"": L O S E R -> \nPositions: \n1: L? \n2: O? \n3: S? \n4: E? \n5: R? \nPattern: S at position 3? And R at 5? \nAvoids all forbidden letters? \n\nBut is it valid? Yes? \nAlso, ""loser"" avoids C,A,N,T,I? \n\nSimilarly, we can use ""homer"": H O M E R? \nBut E at 4? R at 5? \nS? Where? Doesn\'t include S? Then feedback? We know S must be in the word? Why? Because we had ""tires"" guess? S(-)? So S must be in the word? So if we don\'t include S? Then feedback? We would get S missing? But we know S is present? So we must include S? \n\nTherefore, ""loser"" has S? At position 3? \n\n""loser"": L,O,S,E,R -> yes? \nSo: \n- Position 3: S? Which we haven\'t tried? \n- Position 5: R? Which we tried? But we know R is present? And we are testing a new position? Because R was not tried in 5? \n\nPreviously? We tried R only in positions 2 and 3? And wrong? And E is known at 4? \nSo R in 5 is untested? \n\nAlso, S? Tried in position 5? Found wrong? But now S in 3? Untested? And we expect S to be there? Maybe? \n\nCommon word? Yes? \n\nAlternatively? Another word: ""muser"": M U S E R? \nAlso? \n\nBut ""loser"" is more common? \n\nAnother: ""poser"": P O S E R? \n\nAll valid? \n\nNow? Which one to choose? \n\nWe can choose ""loser""? It includes L and O? New letters? \n\nAlso? Notice: in ""tires"", we have E at 4? That was correct? So we can rely? \n\nTherefore, guess ""loser""? \n\nBut we have R at 5? And S at 3? \n\nAlso? If it\'s not? We get feedback? \n\nAnother candidate: if R is in position 1? Then we need S in 2 or 3? And E at 4? \n\nFor example: word ""robed""? But we avoid? Or ""rubel""? Not common? \n\n""RISEN""? Has I? Excluded? \n\n""RESOD""? R E S O D? Then: 1:R,2:E,3:S,4:O,5:D? But E at 4? But we have E at 4? Fixed? So position 2:E? Then? \nWait? Our pattern? If R at 1? Then we can have E at 4? But position 2? We haven\'t tested for E? Actually, we know E is at 4? So position 2 should not be E? Because E is only at 4? We don\'t know? In secret word? E is only at 4? Or could be elsewhere? Actually, the feedback? For ""crane"": E(-) meaning E is present but not at 5? Then for ""tires"": E(✓) at 4? That\'s correct? So E is fixed at 4? And there are no other E? So we must not put E elsewhere? \n\nTherefore, any word must have E only at position 4? \n\nTherefore, for R at position 1? We cannot have E at 2? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nSo pattern for R at 1: \n1:R, 2:?, 3: (S or ?) ,4:E, 5:? \nAnd S must be in 2 or 3? If in 3: R ? S E ? \nValid? \n1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:P? ""rosep""? Not valid? \n1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:M? ""rosem""? No? \n1:R, 2:U, 3:S, 4:E, 5:D? ""rused""? Not common? \nBut ""ruse""? Is 4 letters? \nHow about ""RUSES""? But S twice? And E at 4? So R U S E S? Then positions: \n1:R,2:U,3:S,4:E,5:S -> but S at 3 and 5? But from ""tires"", we have S? And we know S? So if we use duplicate? Then feedback? \n\nBut for now? We assume no duplicate? Because we haven\'t seen? \n\nActually? We don\'t know? \n\nBut common words? \n\nTherefore? The better bet seems R in 5? And we choose ""loser""? \n\nAdditionally? We could try ""poser""? P O S E R? \n\nBut why? \n\nAlso? Note? We haven\'t used P,O,L? \n\nNow? Both ""loser"" and ""poser"" are valid? \n\nBut let\'s choose? \n\nActually? There is another constraint: the word must not contain any excluded letters? \n\nSo? \n\nI think ""loser"" is good? \n\nTherefore? Third guess: loser\n\nBut wait? The word ""loser""? It includes L, O, S, E, R? \nS is at position 3? And we haven\'t tested S? And R at 5? \n\nExpected feedback? \n\nIf the secret word? For example? \n\nPerhaps? \n\nAlternatively? We can choose a word that rules out the other possibility? But it\'s fine? \n\nLet me try? \n\nSo guess? ""loser""? \n\nBut wait? Another word: ""SUPER""? But it starts with S? Pattern S _ _ E R? \nIf S at 1? Then word: S U P E R? \nPositions: \n1:S? \n2: ? \n3:? \n4:E? \n5:R? \nNow? In this? S at first? Which hasn\'t been tested? \nR at last? \nBut U and P? \n\nAlso? Avoids excluded letters? \n\nBut we know? From ""tires"", I was excluded? \n\nNow? ""SUPER""? S,U,P,E,R? \n\nBut P? Not tested? \n\nBut? Also? R at 5? \n\nCompared to ""loser""? L,O,S,E,R? \n\nBoth seem fine? \n\nPerhaps ""super"" is shorter? \n\nBut? Actually? Let me see? \n\nBut? We also need to consider: in ""loser""? Position 3:S? And position 5:R? \n\nIn ""super""? Position 1:S? Then? \n\nWe could? But? \n\nBut? By guessing ""loser""? Or ""super""? \n\nBut? We have? \n\nI think we can go with ""loser"". \n\nTherefore: \n\n<guess>loser</guess> \n\nBut? Let\'s double-check? \n\nSummary: \n- Positions: We know position 4 must be E? \n- R: must be in 1 or 5? \n- S: must be in 1,2,3? \n- Avoid C,A,N,T,I? \n\nIn ""loser"": \n- Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:R \n- We are testing R in position 5? (and also S in position 3) \n\nIf the secret word has R in 5? Then we might get R✓? Or if not? Then wrong? \n\nWe\'ll see? \n\nAlternatively? If R is not in 5? Then we learn that R must be in 1? \n\nBut? For this guess? \n\nYes? \n\nSo? \n\nI choose ""loser"". \n\nBut? We still have to write? \n\nNote: We must include all? \n\nActually? Let me list the known? \n\nPerhaps? There are other constraints? \n\nIn the second guess ""tires""? We learned E(✓) at 4? \n\nAlso?

- E: correct at position 4 (so secret word has E at position 4).
- S: present but not in position 5.

From guess 3:
- L, O: absent.
- S: present but not in position 3 (since guessed at position 3, feedback S(-)).
- E: correct at position 4 (confirmed).
- R: correct at position 5 (so secret word has R at position 5).

Now, we know:
- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5. So the pattern: _ _ _ E R
- S is present in the word, but not in position 3 (from ""loser"") and not in position 5 (from ""tires""). So S must be in position 1 or 2? Because positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So for S? Only positions 1,2,3 are left? But we tried S at positions 5 (in ""tires"") and 3 (in ""loser""), both wrong. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2.

Additionally, we have excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, L, O.

We need to find the first three letters? Actually, the word is: ? ? ? E R, where position 4 is E, position 5 is R. And position 3 is not S? So position 3 must be another letter? And we don't know what? Also, S must be in position 1 or 2? 

Let me list:
- Positions: 
  1: unknown? Could be S?
  2: unknown? Could be S?
  3: unknown? Must not be S? But we don't know?
  4: E (fixed)
  5: R (fixed)

We know S is one of the letters and must be in the word? But we haven't found its correct position? It must be either in position 1, 2, or 3? But wait? We tried position 3? And it was wrong? So S is not in position 3? Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2? 

So possible patterns:
- S ? ? E R   (S at 1)
- ? S ? E R   (S at 2)

And the third position must be filled by another letter? 

We also know the word has exactly one E? And one R? But S? Could be duplicated? But we don't know? 

Moreover, what other letters are possible? We need to avoid excluded letters: C,A,N,T,I,L,O.

So remaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

We need to find the first three letters: either S at 1 and then two letters? Or S at 2 and then the first letter? 

We have to guess? We can form words that fit? 

Additionally, we want to test? We know S must be in 1 or 2? So we can aim to test S in one of these positions? 

Let me consider:

Case 1: S at position 1? Pattern: S ? ? E R? 
Then the middle two letters? 

Case 2: S not at 1? Then S must be at position 2? Pattern: ? S ? E R?

We still have an unknown letter at position 3? 

To maximize information? We might choose a word that is possible? 

We can try to fix S in position 1? And see?

Possible words? For pattern S ? ? E R? 
With S at 1? 
Valid words: 
- ""SAYER"": but A excluded? 
- ""SABER"": A? excluded?
- ""SUPER"": S U P E R? 
  1:S, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R -> but avoids excluded? And letters U and P? 
Not excluded? 
Valid word? 

Similarly: ""SOWER"": S O W E R -> O excluded? 
""SHER"": not 5 letters? 
""SEWER"": S E W E R -> but E repeated? At position 2? We know E is only at 4? So should not be at 2? Therefore, duplicated E? 

But we don't know? Perhaps? 

But ""SUPER"": S U P E R? 
Positions: 
1:S, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R -> 
As above? 

But let me see? 

Now? Similarly? For pattern ? S ? E R? With S at 2? 
Example: ""USHER"": U S H E R -> 
1:U, 2:S, 3:H, 4:E, 5:R -> 
Valid? 

Also? 

But we don't know? 

Now? How to resolve? 

We can guess ""super""? Which has S at position 1? And if wrong? Then S must be at position 2? 

Similarly? 

But also? We can choose a word that respects both? 

However? We have only 3 guesses left? (since fourth guess)? 

Therefore? We can guess?

I think ""super"" is a good candidate? Because? 
- It places S at position 1? Which we haven't tested? 
- If S is in position 1? Then it might be ✓? 
- Or if not? Then S must be at position 2? 
- Also? It introduces U and P? 

Similarly? 

But let me see? We know? 

Actually? We can also try a word without S? But we must include S? Because? Actually? We don't have to? But if we exclude S? We might get feedback that S is missing? But we know S is present? So we must include S? 

Therefore? 

So? Guess ""super""? 

But? If S is at position 2? Then ""super"" would have S at 1? Wrong? Then we will get S(-)? Meaning S is present? But at wrong position? Then we know S must be at position 2? 

Similarly? 

Then? 

Also? We might find? 

Another candidate: ""usher""? Which has S at position 2? 

Why one over the other? 

We don't know? 

Also? Notice: in ""super"", we have P? And U? New letters? 

Similarly? 

We can choose? 

But? Perhaps we want to test the other possibility? 

Actually? Since we don't know? We might guess one? And then based on feedback? 

I think? That's the best? 

Let me choose ""super""? 

Therefore? Fourth guess: ""super""? 

But? Alternatively? 

We have? 

After? 

Yes? 

So? 

Therefore? 

<guess>super</guess> 

But let me confirm the format? 

Final decision: ""super""

### Reasoning Based on Feedback

**Feedback Analysis:**
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: `C` (absent), `R` (present but wrong position), `A` (absent), `N` (absent), `E` (present but wrong position).  
  → **Key Insights**: `R` and `E` are in the word. Avoid `C`, `A`, `N`.  
- **Guess 2 (tires)**: `T` (absent), `I` (absent), `R` (present but wrong position), `E` (correct in position 4), `S` (present but wrong position).  
  → **Key Insights**: `R` is not in position 3. `E` is fixed at position 4. `S` is present but not in position 5. Avoid `T`, `I`.  
- **Guess 3 (loser)**: `L` (absent), `O` (absent), `S` (present but wrong position), `E` (correct), `R` (correct).  
  → **Key Insights**: `S` is not in position 3. `E` (position 4) and `R` (position 5) are fixed. Avoid `L`, `O`.  

**Constraints Summary:**
- **Fixed positions**: Position 4 = `E`, Position 5 = `R`.  
- **Confirmed present**: `S` must be in position 1 or 2 (as it cannot be in 3, 4, or 5).  
- **Absent letters**: `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I`, `L`, `O` must be excluded.  
- **Unknowns**: Letters for positions 1 and 2 (one of which is `S`), and position 3.  

**Strategy for Next Guess (Try 4/6):**
- Target resolving `S`'s position: Test it in **position 1** since position 2 is also possible.  
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., `U`, `P`) to gain more information.  
- Prioritize words matching the pattern `_ _ _ E R` with `S` in position 1 and avoiding excluded letters.  

**Ideal Word: `SUPER`**  
- Structure: `S` (position 1), `U` (position 2), `P` (position 3), `E` (position 4), `R` (position 5).  
- **Why?**  
  - Tests `S` in position 1 (untested; if wrong, `S` must be in position 2).  
  - Covers `U` and `P` (common unused letters; high frequency).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters and aligns with position constraints.  
  - Maximizes info: Feedback on `S` and new letters (`U`, `P`) will pinpoint word structure.  

If `SUPER` is incorrect, feedback on `S` will confirm if it belongs in position 2. Position 3 (`P`) and new letters will help narrow the next guess.

<guess>super</guess>",super,"We are given feedback from three guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Second guess: ""tires"" -> T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
Third guess: ""loser"" -> L(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓) R(✓)

Interpretation:

From guess 1:
- C, A, N: absent.
- R: present but not in position 2.
- E: present but not in position 5.

From guess 2:
- T, I: absent.
- R: present but not in position 3.
- E: correct at position 4 (so secret word has E at position 4).
- S: present but not in position 5.

From guess 3:
- L, O: absent.
- S: present but not in position 3 (since guessed at position 3, feedback S(-)).
- E: correct at position 4 (confirmed).
- R: correct at position 5 (so secret word has R at position 5).

Now, we know:
- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5. So the pattern: _ _ _ E R
- S is present in the word, but not in position 3 (from ""loser"") and not in position 5 (from ""tires""). So S must be in position 1 or 2? Because positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So for S? Only positions 1,2,3 are left? But we tried S at positions 5 (in ""tires"") and 3 (in ""loser""), both wrong. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2.

Additionally, we have excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, L, O.

We need to find the first three letters? Actually, the word is: ? ? ? E R, where position 4 is E, position 5 is R. And position 3 is not S? So position 3 must be another letter? And we don't know what? Also, S must be in position 1 or 2? 

Let me list:
- Positions: 
  1: unknown? Could be S?
  2: unknown? Could be S?
  3: unknown? Must not be S? But we don't know?
  4: E (fixed)
  5: R (fixed)

We know S is one of the letters and must be in the word? But we haven't found its correct position? It must be either in position 1, 2, or 3? But wait? We tried position 3? And it was wrong? So S is not in position 3? Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2? 

So possible patterns:
- S ? ? E R   (S at 1)
- ? S ? E R   (S at 2)

And the third position must be filled by another letter? 

We also know the word has exactly one E? And one R? But S? Could be duplicated? But we don't know? 

Moreover, what other letters are possible? We need to avoid excluded letters: C,A,N,T,I,L,O.

So remaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

We need to find the first three letters: either S at 1 and then two letters? Or S at 2 and then the first letter? 

We have to guess? We can form words that fit? 

Additionally, we want to test? We know S must be in 1 or 2? So we can aim to test S in one of these positions? 

Let me consider:

Case 1: S at position 1? Pattern: S ? ? E R? 
Then the middle two letters? 

Case 2: S not at 1? Then S must be at position 2? Pattern: ? S ? E R?

We still have an unknown letter at position 3? 

To maximize information? We might choose a word that is possible? 

We can try to fix S in position 1? And see?

Possible words? For pattern S ? ? E R? 
With S at 1? 
Valid words: 
- ""SAYER"": but A excluded? 
- ""SABER"": A? excluded?
- ""SUPER"": S U P E R? 
  1:S, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R -> but avoids excluded? And letters U and P? 
Not excluded?

Similarly: ""SOWER"": S O W E R -> O excluded? 
""SHER"": not 5 letters? 
""SEWER"": S E W E R -> but E repeated? At position 2? We know E is only at 4? So should not be at 2? Therefore, duplicated E? 

But we don't know? Perhaps? 

But ""SUPER"": S U P E R? 
Positions: 
1:S, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R -> 
As above? 

But let me see? 

Now? Similarly? For pattern ? S ? E R? With S at 2? 
Example: ""USHER"": U S H E R -> 
1:U, 2:S, 3:H, 4:E, 5:R -> 
Valid? 

Also? 

But we don't know? 

Now? How to resolve? 

We can guess ""super""? Which has S at position 1? And if wrong? Then S must be at position 2? 

Similarly? 

But also? We can choose a word that respects both? 

However? We have only 3 guesses left? (since fourth guess)? 

Therefore? We can guess?

I think ""super"" is a good candidate? Because? 
- It places S at position 1? Which we haven't tested? 
- If S is in position 1? Then it might be ✓? 
- Or if not? Then S must be at position 2? 
- Also? It introduces U and P? 

Similarly? 

But let me see? We know? 

Actually? We can also try a word without S? But we must include S? Because? Actually? We don't have to? But if we exclude S? We might get feedback that S is missing? But we know S is present? So we must include S? 

Therefore? 

So? Guess ""super""? 

But? If S is at position 2? Then ""super"" would have S at 1? Wrong? Then we will get S(-)? Meaning S is present? But at wrong position? Then we know S must be at position 2? 

Similarly? 

Then? 

Also? We might find? 

Another candidate: ""usher""? Which has S at position 2? 

Why one over the other?

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,sever,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 
 - C and R are common consonants.
 - A and E are common vowels.
 - N is also a common consonant.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 2 and 5 respectively in ""crane"").
- Letters C, A, N are absent.

We have 6 tries total, and this is the second guess.

Now, we need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Doesn't include C, A, N (since they are marked as not in the word)
- Includes R and E (since they are present, but not in the same positions as in ""crane"")
- We must also consider that R and E are in the word but not in the positions we guessed.

In the first guess:
- R was in position 2 (second letter) but is actually in a different position in the secret word.
- E was in position 5 (last letter) but is actually in a different position.

For the second guess, we should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 is wrong and not 5? Actually, it could be in 5 too, because the feedback only says wrong position, not that it can't be in 5. But note: the feedback for R says ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, position 5 is available because it was not tried for R. However, E was in position 5 and we know E is present but not in position 5? No: wait, the feedback for E says it is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1,2,3,4? And similarly, R can be in positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, positions 1,3,4 are common for both? Let me clarify:

The secret word has letters: R and E (and three others) and excludes C, A, N.

We must avoid:
- Using C, A, N anywhere.
- Placing R in position 2 (since that was wrong).
- Placing E in position 5 (since that was wrong).

We also don't know the other letters. We need to choose a word that includes R and E, and avoids C,A,N.

Common letters: Let's try to pick a word that includes other common letters like T, O, I, L, S, etc.

Since R is present, we can try words that start with R? Or have R in another spot.

Also, note that the secret word doesn't have A, so words with A should be avoided.

Let me think of words that include R and E, and without C,A,N.

Possible candidates:

1. Words starting with R: But we don't know if R is first. But we can try? However, we should avoid having R in position 2? Actually, for our next guess, we can put R anywhere except position 2? Or we could? Actually, we can put R anywhere we have not yet ruled out. The feedback tells us only that position 2 is incorrect for R. So R could be in 1,3,4,5? But note: we also have E that must be placed not in position 5.

But wait: the secret word has E somewhere else? So in our next guess, we don't want to put E in position 5 again? Actually, we are allowed, but it might give redundant information? So we should avoid placing E in position 5 because we already know it's not there? Similarly, we should avoid placing R in position 2.

So for our second guess, let's avoid:
- Putting R in position 2
- Putting E in position 5

Also, the word must not contain C, A, N.

We have to guess a word that includes R and E? Actually, not necessarily? Wait no, we know R and E are in the word? Actually, from the feedback, R and E are present? So yes, they must be in the word? Therefore, every subsequent guess must include R and E? But we don't know how many times? So we assume they appear at least once.

Now, we also don't know any other letters.

We can try a word that uses other common letters? Like T, O, I, L, S.

Possible words:

Consider: ""ROTATE"" -> too long? We need 5 letters. And it has A? Which is ruled out? Also has T? But A is excluded? So no A allowed? So ""ROTATE"" has A? So not allowed.

Other words:

- ""STORE"": 
  - S, T, O, R, E.
  - Does it include R? Yes. E? Yes.
  - Avoids C, A, N? Yes.
  - Position: 
    - R is placed in position 4? And we are avoiding position 2? We are not placing R in position 2? Here R is in 4? That's new.
    - E is placed in position 5? But we must avoid? Because E is in position 5? But feedback on E said E(-) meaning it's present but not in position 5? So putting E in position 5 is not allowed? Actually, we can put it? But we already know that position 5 is wrong? So if we put it there, we expect a ""-"" if E is still in the word? But we know it is? So we might get a ""-"" again? Alternatively, we might get a ""x"" if the secret word had two E's and we haven't tried E in other positions? Actually, no: we know there's at least one E? But we should put E in a different position to try to find its correct spot? Therefore, we should avoid position 5? So let's not put E in position 5.

So avoid:
- Letters: C, A, N
- Position 2: R?
- Position 5: E?

Alternatively, we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4? And then we avoid R in position 2? Position 2 can be any letter? Actually, position 2 can be any letter? But R cannot be there? Only that R was in position 2 last time? So we can put E in position 2? Yes, because last time E was not in position 5? But we haven't tested position 2 for E? So yes, we can put E in position 2? But we know that R was in position 2? But R was taken as absent? Actually, no: R is present? But we put R in position 2? But the feedback said it's in the word but not in position 2? So we think R is not in position 2? And E? We don't know? Maybe E is in position 2? We don't know? It could be? So let's try to put E in a position we haven't tried? Currently, we tried E only in position 5? So positions 1,2,3,4? We can try one? Similarly, R: we tried in position 2? So we can try R in 1,3,4,5? But note: position 5? We also tried E in 5? So R can be in 5? Because E was tried in 5? So we can try.

But we might want to test different letters? We haven't tried? Also, we don't know if there might be other letters? So let's choose a word that uses new common letters? Such as T, O, I, L, S.

Possible words:

- ""tires"": T, I, R, E, S -> no C,A,N? Yes. E is in position 4? Not 5. R is in position 3? Not 2? So good! But wait: positions?
  - T in 1st
  - I in 2nd -> we don't know? We don't have info? But we haven't ruled out? 
  - R in 3rd: not 2nd? Previously R was in 2nd? So now we are trying R in 3rd? Which is new.
  - E in 4th? Previously E was in 5th? Now we are trying E in 4th? Which is new.

Alternative: ""robes""? But it has B? Maybe? Also, E in position 5? We wanted to avoid? 
- robes: R, O, B, E, S -> E in position 5? Avoid? So better avoid position 5 for E? 

So ""tires"" seems good? But let me see: what common letters we cover? 
It includes T, I, R, E, S? That's 5 distinct letters? And we exclude C,A,N? Also, we are testing S? Which is common? 

Another option: ""stern"": 
S, T, E, R, N -> but N is excluded? We can't because N was marked as absent? So ""tires"" doesn't have N? Good? 

Also, ""slope"": S, L, O, P, E? But it doesn't include R? We know R must be in the word? Why? Because R was marked as present? And we haven't found the word? So we must include R? Otherwise, we might not get information? However, if we don't include R, then if the new guess has no R and we get feedback that shows R is there? Actually, the feedback will tell us? But we are trying to guess quickly? And we know R is in? So we must include R? Similarly E?

Therefore, in the second guess, we must include both R and E? Yes? Because we know they are present? And also avoid C,A,N? 

We can try ""tries"": T, R, I, E, S? 
This word has R in position 2? But wait: we must avoid putting R in position 2? Because last time R was in position 2? And the feedback said it's present but not in that position? Therefore, putting R in position 2 again? Then the feedback would say ""-"" again? And we learned nothing new? So that wastes a slot? So we should avoid putting R in position 2? Similarly, avoid E in position 5? 

So ""tries"": Positions? 
1: T? 
2: R? -> but we are putting R in position 2? Which we already know is wrong? We expect a ""-"" again? 
3: I? 
4: E? 
5: S? 

We are avoiding E in position 5? But here E is in position 4? So that's okay? But R is in position 2? Which we shouldn't? Actually, we have to avoid position 2 for R? So we cannot use ""tries"" because we are repeating a known wrong position? We want to rule out new positions? So we avoid?

Therefore, ""tires"": 
1: T? 
2: I? 
3: R? -> not in position 2? So new position? 
4: E? -> not in position 5? So new position? 
5: S? 

So that's good? 

Alternatively, ""resit"": 
1: R? 
2: E? -> but we haven't tested position 2? We know R was wrong in 2? But E? We haven't tested E in 2? So we can? But is it a real word? I think RESIT is valid? 

But let me think: We know R is present? Putting R in position 1? We don't know if that's correct? Similarly? 

But we have two positions: R can be in 1,3,4,5? And E in 1,2,3,4? 

If we put R in 1? Then we might get ✓? Or -? Or x if by mistake? But we know R is in? So ✓ or -? 

Similarly, for E? 

In ""resit"": 
R in 1? 
E in 2? 
S in 3? 
I in 4? 
T in 5? 

We avoid: 
- Letters: C,A,N? Yes? 
- R not in 2? Yes? 
- E not in 5? Yes? 

So we are testing R in position 1 and E in position 2? Both new? 

But which one is better? 
We get to test two new positions? 

Alternatively, ""store"": 
S, T, O, R, E -> 
R in position 4? 
E in position 5? But we avoid E in position 5? So that doesn't help? Therefore, we skip.

So between ""tires"" and ""resit""? Both are valid?

Another candidate: ""arise""? But has A? Ruled out? Not allowed.

""opera""? Has O,P,E,R,A? A? Excluded? So not allowed.

""house"": H,O,U,S,E? Doesn't have R? So we don't include R? Then the feedback for R? We know R is in the word? So if we don't include R? We get a problem? The feedback will tell us that R is still missing? Meaning? For each letter? So if we don't include R? Then the position where we don't have R? But for letters? We get feedback for each letter? Specifically? For ""house"", 
H: new? 
O: new? 
U: new? 
S: new? 
E: and E? We know E? But position? E is in position 5? Which we already tested? And was wrong? So we put E again in 5? So we expect ""-"" for E? Because in wrong position? Because we know E is in the word but position 5 is wrong? So we expect ""-""? 
And R? We didn't include? So the feedback would say:
- For H: could be ✓, - , or x? 
Similarly for O,U,S? 
Then for E: might be ""-"" again? 
But we didn't test R? So what? We know R is present? So we need to include R? Otherwise, we won't get information about R's position? 

Therefore, we must include R? And E? Because they are confirmed? 

So words without R? Are wasted? Similarly without E? 

Therefore, we stick to including both? 

So let me choose: 
I am thinking of ""resit""? Which has R and E? 

But note: the word might have double letters? We don't know? 

But for now? 

Actually, ""tires"" is the same letters as ""tries""? But in different order? Without repeating known wrong positions? 

Summary of candidates:

1. ""tires"": 
   - T, I, R, E, S 
   - R in pos 3 (new) 
   - E in pos 4 (new) 

2. ""resit"": 
   - R in pos 1 (new) 
   - E in pos 2 (new) 

Which one is better? 

I am inclined to ""tires""? Because position 1 has T? Which is a common letter? And position 2 has I? Which is common vowel? But also ""resit"" has R as first? which is less common? Actually, many words start with T? 

Another candidate: ""stern"": but has N? Not allowed? 

""brize""? Not a common word? 

So I'll go with ""tires"". 

It avoids C,A,N and puts R and E in new positions? 

Also, letters T, I, S? Are new? Common? 

So let's guess ""tires"". 

But wait: we haven't tried position 1? Position 2? etc? 

Also, if the secret word has I? Then we might find? 

I think it's a good guess? 

Therefore, second guess: <guess>tires</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x""), so they must be avoided.
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked with ""-"").
- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include both R and E (as they are confirmed present) but place R anywhere except position 2 and E anywhere except position 5.
- Avoid C, A, and N entirely.
- Introduce new common letters (like T, I, S) to test additional potential positions.

A strong choice is **""tires""** because:
- It contains R (placed in position 3, a new untested position) and E (placed in position 4, avoiding position 5).
- It avoids C, A, and N.
- It introduces new common letters: T in position 1, I in position 2, and S in position 5 (all not tested before).

This strategically maximizes information gain by testing R and E in new positions while covering new high-frequency letters.

<guess>tires</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tires -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C, A, N: absent.
- R: present but not in position 2 (so in position 1, 3, or 4? But note: positions are 1-based? Actually, in the example: BRISK and STORM: S is position 1? So ""crane"": C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5). Feedback: R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. E(-) meaning E is in the word but not in position 5.

Second guess: ""tires"" -> T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
Interpretation:
- T: absent (x) -> so T is not in the word.
- I: absent (x) -> so I is not in the word.
- R: present but not in position 3 (because R was guessed in position 3? ""tires"": T(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), S(5). Feedback: R(-) so R is present but not in position 3.
- E: correct! (✓) in position 4. So E is in the secret word at position 4.
- S: present but not in position 5. So S is in the word but not in position 5.

Now, we have:
- The secret word contains: R (present), E (correct at position 4), S (present).
- Additional letters: we know E is at position 4.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N (from first guess), T, I (from second guess).
- Also note: we have information about positions for R and S.

Specifically:
- R is present but:
  - Not in position 2 (from ""crane"")
  - Not in position 3 (from ""tires"")
  - And since E is at position 4, R cannot be there? R can be in positions 1 or 5? Because remaining positions are 1, 5? Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. E is fixed at 4? So R must be in one of 1,5? Actually, also? What about position 2 and 3 we know R is not? And position 4 is E? So R must be either in position 1 or position 5? Unless there are multiple letters? But we haven't had any indication? But we don't know? There might be two R's? But let's assume no duplicates? Typically? We might need to consider? But for now? 

Similarly, S:
- From ""crane"": we tried S? Actually, we didn't? ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E? No S? So first time we see S? Then ""tires"" had S at position 5? Feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not at position 5? So S must be in positions 1,2,3? But note: position 4 is taken by E? So available positions: 1,2,3? And R is also to be placed in either 1 or 5? But S? So they might share? Actually, S could be in 1,2, or 3? And R in 1 or 5? So conflict? Only at position 1? That is, if R is in 1, then S cannot be in 1? So S must be in 2 or 3? And if R is in 5, then S in 1,2,3 anywhere? 

Currently, we don't know the fifth letter? We have: 
- Position 4: E (locked)
- R must be in 1 or 5?
- S in 2,3? Or if R in 5 then S in 1,2,3? But we also have two other letters? We know the secret word has 5 distinct? Actually, we don't know? Some words have repeated letters? But let's avoid assuming? 

Known letters: 
- R: present (in 1 or 5)
- S: present (in wherever) and not in 5? 
- E: at 4.
- And we know the word has two more letters? Because we haven't found all? 

Excluded? Total excluded: C, A, N, T, I.

Also, we must avoid using these?

We need to guess a word that:
1. Must include R and S (they are present).
2. Must have E at position 4.
3. Avoids C,A,N,T,I.
4. Must have two more letters? And we don't know? 

Furthermore, we have constraints on R and S positions:
- R: must not be in position 2 or 3? And since position 4 is E? So only options: position 1 or 5? 
- S: must not be in position 5? And we haven't tried positions 1,2,3? So S must be in 1,2, or 3? But if R is in position 1, then S must be in 2 or 3? If R in 5, S can be in 1,2,3? 

We also would like to test other positions?

We don't know the fifth (third) letter? And another letter? We know the secret word has 5 letters? We have E fixed? And R? And S? And two more? So two unknowns?

We need to guess a word that fits these constraints? 

Let's look for words with pattern: 
- Position 4: E
- Position 1: either R or something else? But if R is in 1? Then word starts with R? Or if not? 

Possible words:

Consider R at position 1? Then S in 2 or 3? 

Options:
R at 1, E at 4: 
- Words like: R? ? E? E? 
But we have S? 

For example: 
ROSE? But O? And S? Position 5 must be something? 
R O S E? Wait: positions: 
1: R? 
2: O? 
3: S? 
4: E? 
5: ? But we have S at position 3? Then the fifth letter? Also, let's see: does it avoid C,A,N,T,I? Yes? Then what? 
But we haven't fixed the fifth letter? 

Other words: R with E at fourth? 

But alternatively, R at position 5? Then the word ends with R? And position 4 is E? So ...E R? 

Now, we want to test positions? Also, we haven't tested letters? 

Common letters remaining? Excluding C,A,N,T,I? Remaining letters: 
B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common letters? For example: O, L, U, P, etc. 

Let's try to form words:

Case 1: R in position 1? Then S in position 2 or 3? 
- If S in position 2: R S ? E ? 
- Possibilities: R S _ E _ ? 
  Words: R S (letter) E (letter) -> RS?E?
  Possible: ROSE (but O is in? But O? Then E? Then? Wait: R O S E -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E -> but in this, S is at position 3? Then fifth letter? ROSE? Not 5 letters? Wait, ROSE is 4? But 5-letter words: ROSED? Not valid? 
  Actually: ROBES? But we avoid B? Maybe? Or wait, we haven't ruled out? 

But let's search:
Possible words: 
- ""ROLES"": 
  1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S? -> but we know S? And we have S at position 5? But S cannot be in position 5? Because from ""tires"", S was at 5 and feedback said - meaning wrong position? So position 5 is invalid for S? Therefore, if R at 1? We cannot have S at 5? 

Also, ""tires"" feedback: S(-) meaning S is not at 5? So in any guess? We avoid S in position 5? 

Therefore, for R in 1? We must put S in 2 or 3? 

If R in 1, S in 2: pattern R S ? E ? 
Possible words? 
RS?E? 
Examples: 
- R S ? E ? 
""rs"" are rare? Maybe ""ruse""? But we know E at 4? So R U S E ...? Wait: position 4 is E? And E must be at 4? So R S ? E ? 
So positions: 1:R,2:S,3:?,4:E,5:? 
Then the word? Must be 5 letters? Valid: RSLEE? Not valid? ""rise""? Wait: ""rise"" is 4 letters? 
We need 5-letter words? 
For 1:R,2:S,3:?,4:E,5:? 
Valid words? 
- ""RUSES"": But S appears twice? And at position 5? Also S? But already excluded? 
Or ""RASED"": But A? Excluded? 
""RUSLE"": Not valid? 
Perhaps no common words? 

Alternatively: R at 1, S at position 3: pattern R ? S E ? 
Examples: 
1:R,2:?,3:S,4:E,5:? 
Valid words: 
- ""ROUSE"": R O U S E -> yes? 
Letters: O,U -> not excluded? 
Also, ""REUSE"": R E U S E -> but E repeated? And E is at position 2? Duplicated E? Then for position 2: E? But the secret word? We know E is at position 4? But there might be two E? 
Actually, the feedback might show? 
But let's see if it's possible? 

Similarly, ""raise"": has A? Excluded? 
""rouse"": R O U S E -> 
1:R,2:O,3:U,4:S? Wait, S? But we need E at 4? And S at position? 
- Actually: ""rouse"": R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> no E at 4? That doesn't work? 
We need E at 4? So ""rouse""? Cannot? 

How about ""RESET""? But R at 1? Position 4: E? So R E S E T? 
1:R, 2:E, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T? 
But T is excluded? 
Not valid? 

Another word: ""RIPES""? I excluded? 

So perhaps none without excluded letters? 

Alternative: R at position 5? Pattern: ? ? ? E R? 
Then S? Can be at 1,2,3? 

Pattern: _ _ _ E R? 
And S must be in 1,2,3? 

Now, words: ... E R? 

Examples: 
- ""__SER"" -> then S at position 3? 
  For example: ""POSER"", ""LOSER"", ""HOSER"", ""ROGER"" is R O G E R -> repeated R? Duplicated R? But we don't know if possible? 
But R? We must include R? And if R is at 5? Then there is only one R? 
So words must have S somewhere? And E at 4? R at 5? 

Pattern: _ _ S E R? 
Then first two letters: two more letters? For example: ""PASER"" -> has A? Excluded? 
""USER"" -> but 4 letters? 
5-letter: ""HOSER"": H O S E R -> 
Positions: 
1: H? 
2: O? 
3: S? 
4: E? 
5: R? 
This works? 
Avoids C,A,N,T,I? Yes? 
And R is at position 5? Which is allowed? 
S is at position 3? Which is not 5? So okay? 
But we haven't tried O and H before? 

Alternatively: S at position 1: pattern S _ _ E R? 
Words: ""S_ _ER"" 
Examples: ""SOWER"", ""SUPER"", ""SABER"" (has A? excluded), ""SHEER"" (double E? and E at 4 but also other E?), ""SHOER""? Not common? 

S at position 2: pattern _ S ? E R? 
For example: ""ASPER"" (has A? excluded), ""ISLER""? Not common? 

So ""HOSER"" seems good? 

But let me see: common letters? 

Another pattern: without S? But we must include S? Wait? 

We know:
- R must be in 1 or 5?
- E at 4?
- S must be in 1,2,3? Except if R in 1? Then S cannot in 1? 

But also, we don't know the other letters? 

We can also consider: maybe S is the other possible position? 

But let me try: we need to guess? And there is also the possibility that R is in position 1? And we haven't found? 

Maybe we can try a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to commit? 

Another idea: we know the word has S? But not found? 

We can try ""loser"": L O S E R -> 
Positions: 
1: L? 
2: O? 
3: S? 
4: E? 
5: R? 
Pattern: S at position 3? And R at 5? 
Avoids all forbidden letters? 

But is it valid? Yes? 
Also, ""loser"" avoids C,A,N,T,I? 

Similarly, we can use ""homer"": H O M E R? 
But E at 4? R at 5? 
S? Where? Doesn't include S? Then feedback? We know S must be in the word? Why? Because we had ""tires"" guess? S(-)? So S must be in the word? So if we don't include S? Then feedback? We would get S missing? But we know S is present? So we must include S? 

Therefore, ""loser"" has S? At position 3? 

""loser"": L,O,S,E,R -> yes? 
So: 
- Position 3: S? Which we haven't tried? 
- Position 5: R? Which we tried? But we know R is present? And we are testing a new position? Because R was not tried in 5? 

Previously? We tried R only in positions 2 and 3? And wrong? And E is known at 4? 
So R in 5 is untested? 

Also, S? Tried in position 5? Found wrong? But now S in 3? Untested? And we expect S to be there? Maybe? 

Common word? Yes? 

Alternatively? Another word: ""muser"": M U S E R? 
Also? 

But ""loser"" is more common? 

Another: ""poser"": P O S E R? 

All valid? 

Now? Which one to choose? 

We can choose ""loser""? It includes L and O? New letters? 

Also? Notice: in ""tires"", we have E at 4? That was correct? So we can rely? 

Therefore, guess ""loser""? 

But we have R at 5? And S at 3? 

Also? If it's not? We get feedback? 

Another candidate: if R is in position 1? Then we need S in 2 or 3? And E at 4? 

For example: word ""robed""? But we avoid? Or ""rubel""? Not common? 

""RISEN""? Has I? Excluded? 

""RESOD""? R E S O D? Then: 1:R,2:E,3:S,4:O,5:D? But E at 4? But we have E at 4? Fixed? So position 2:E? Then? 
Wait? Our pattern? If R at 1? Then we can have E at 4? But position 2? We haven't tested for E? Actually, we know E is at 4? So position 2 should not be E? Because E is only at 4? We don't know? In secret word? E is only at 4? Or could be elsewhere? Actually, the feedback? For ""crane"": E(-) meaning E is present but not at 5? Then for ""tires"": E(✓) at 4? That's correct? So E is fixed at 4? And there are no other E? So we must not put E elsewhere? 

Therefore, any word must have E only at position 4? 

Therefore, for R at position 1? We cannot have E at 2? 

Similarly? 

So pattern for R at 1: 
1:R, 2:?, 3: (S or ?) ,4:E, 5:? 
And S must be in 2 or 3? If in 3: R ? S E ? 
Valid? 
1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:P? ""rosep""? Not valid? 
1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:M? ""rosem""? No? 
1:R, 2:U, 3:S, 4:E, 5:D? ""rused""? Not common? 
But ""ruse""? Is 4 letters? 
How about ""RUSES""? But S twice? And E at 4? So R U S E S? Then positions: 
1:R,2:U,3:S,4:E,5:S -> but S at 3 and 5? But from ""tires"", we have S? And we know S? So if we use duplicate? Then feedback? 

But for now? We assume no duplicate? Because we haven't seen? 

Actually? We don't know? 

But common words? 

Therefore? The better bet seems R in 5? And we choose ""loser""? 

Additionally? We could try ""poser""? P O S E R? 

But why? 

Also? Note? We haven't used P,O,L? 

Now? Both ""loser"" and ""poser"" are valid? 

But let's choose? 

Actually? There is another constraint: the word must not contain any excluded letters? 

So? 

I think ""loser"" is good? 

Therefore? Third guess: loser

But wait? The word ""loser""? It includes L, O, S, E, R? 
S is at position 3? And we haven't tested S? And R at 5? 

Expected feedback? 

If the secret word? For example? 

Perhaps? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that rules out the other possibility? But it's fine? 

Let me try? 

So guess? ""loser""? 

But wait? Another word: ""SUPER""? But it starts with S? Pattern S _ _ E R? 
If S at 1? Then word: S U P E R? 
Positions: 
1:S? 
2: ? 
3:? 
4:E? 
5:R? 
Now? In this? S at first? Which hasn't been tested? 
R at last? 
But U and P? 

Also? Avoids excluded letters? 

But we know? From ""tires"", I was excluded? 

Now? ""SUPER""? S,U,P,E,R? 

But P? Not tested? 

But? Also? R at 5? 

Compared to ""loser""? L,O,S,E,R? 

Both seem fine? 

Perhaps ""super"" is shorter? 

But? Actually? Let me see? 

But? We also need to consider: in ""loser""? Position 3:S? And position 5:R? 

In ""super""? Position 1:S? Then? 

We could? But? 

But? By guessing ""loser""? Or ""super""? 

But? We have? 

I think we can go with ""loser"". 

Therefore: 

<guess>loser</guess> 

But? Let's double-check? 

Summary: 
- Positions: We know position 4 must be E? 
- R: must be in 1 or 5? 
- S: must be in 1,2,3? 
- Avoid C,A,N,T,I? 

In ""loser"": 
- Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:R 
- We are testing R in position 5? (and also S in position 3) 

If the secret word has R in 5? Then we might get R✓? Or if not? Then wrong? 

We'll see? 

Alternatively? If R is not in 5? Then we learn that R must be in 1? 

But? For this guess? 

Yes? 

So? 

I choose ""loser"". 

But? We still have to write? 

Note: We must include all? 

Actually? Let me list the known? 

Perhaps? There are other constraints? 

In the second guess ""tires""? We learned E(✓) at 4? 

Also? R(-) at 3? 

Now? 

We are guessing? 

I think? 

Therefore? 

Final guess: loser### Reasoning for the Next Guess

We have two previous guesses with feedback:

1. **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
   - `C`, `A`, `N` are absent from the secret word.  
   - `R` is present but not in position 2.  
   - `E` is present but not in position 5.  

2. **Guess 2: tires → Feedback: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)**  
   - `T` and `I` are absent.  
   - `R` is present but not in position 3.  
   - `E` is correct and fixed in position 4!  
   - `S` is present but not in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters:**  
  - `E` is locked at position 4.  
  - `R` and `S` are present in the word.
- **Absent letters:** `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I` must be avoided.  
- **Position constraints for `R`:**  
  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or 3 (from ""tires"").  
  - Since position 4 is occupied by `E`, `R` must be in position 1 or 5 (*no duplicates inferred yet*).  
- **Position constraints for `S`:**  
  - Cannot be in position 5 (from ""tires"").  
  - Must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
- **Unknowns:** Two letters remain unknown (besides `E`, `R`, `S`), with no duplicates implied.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include `R` and `S`:** Both are confirmed present.  
- **Position `R` correctly:** Prioritize testing `R` in position 1 or 5 to resolve its location.  
- **Position `S` strategically:** Place `S` in an untested position (1, 2, or 3), avoiding position 5.  
- **Introduce new, common letters:** Test high-frequency consonants/vowels not yet evaluated (e.g., `L`, `O`, `M`) to gather more information.  
- **Avoid guessing `R` in position 5 if `S` is in position 1:** Both letters share possible positions, but feedback will clarify conflicts.  

Ideal word suggestions:
- **`loser`**:  
  - `L` (position 1), `O` (position 2), `S` (position 3), `E` (position 4), `R` (position 5).  
  - Tests `R` in position 5 and `S` in position 3 (both new positions).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (`C`/`A`/`N`/`T`/`I`).  
  - Introduces `L` and `O` for additional coverage.  
- **Alternative: `poser` or `super`**  
  - Similar pattern but less common letters; `loser` is prioritized as it follows the constraints elegantly.

### Why `loser`?
- If correct: Wins the game (but unlikely this early).  
- If partial: Feedback on `R` (position 5) will confirm if `R` belongs at the end or start (position 1).  
- Feedback on `S` (position 3) and new letters (`L`, `O`) will simplify next guesses.

<guess>loser</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tires -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
Guess 3: loser -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from three guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Second guess: ""tires"" -> T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
Third guess: ""loser"" -> L(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓) R(✓)

Interpretation:

From guess 1:
- C, A, N: absent.
- R: present but not in position 2.
- E: present but not in position 5.

From guess 2:
- T, I: absent.
- R: present but not in position 3.
- E: correct at position 4 (so secret word has E at position 4).
- S: present but not in position 5.

From guess 3:
- L, O: absent.
- S: present but not in position 3 (since guessed at position 3, feedback S(-)).
- E: correct at position 4 (confirmed).
- R: correct at position 5 (so secret word has R at position 5).

Now, we know:
- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5. So the pattern: _ _ _ E R
- S is present in the word, but not in position 3 (from ""loser"") and not in position 5 (from ""tires""). So S must be in position 1 or 2? Because positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So for S? Only positions 1,2,3 are left? But we tried S at positions 5 (in ""tires"") and 3 (in ""loser""), both wrong. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2.

Additionally, we have excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, L, O.

We need to find the first three letters? Actually, the word is: ? ? ? E R, where position 4 is E, position 5 is R. And position 3 is not S? So position 3 must be another letter? And we don't know what? Also, S must be in position 1 or 2? 

Let me list:
- Positions: 
  1: unknown? Could be S?
  2: unknown? Could be S?
  3: unknown? Must not be S? But we don't know?
  4: E (fixed)
  5: R (fixed)

We know S is one of the letters and must be in the word? But we haven't found its correct position? It must be either in position 1, 2, or 3? But wait? We tried position 3? And it was wrong? So S is not in position 3? Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2? 

So possible patterns:
- S ? ? E R   (S at 1)
- ? S ? E R   (S at 2)

And the third position must be filled by another letter? 

We also know the word has exactly one E? And one R? But S? Could be duplicated? But we don't know? 

Moreover, what other letters are possible? We need to avoid excluded letters: C,A,N,T,I,L,O.

So remaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

We need to find the first three letters: either S at 1 and then two letters? Or S at 2 and then the first letter? 

We have to guess? We can form words that fit? 

Additionally, we want to test? We know S must be in 1 or 2? So we can aim to test S in one of these positions? 

Let me consider:

Case 1: S at position 1? Pattern: S ? ? E R? 
Then the middle two letters? 

Case 2: S not at 1? Then S must be at position 2? Pattern: ? S ? E R?

We still have an unknown letter at position 3? 

To maximize information? We might choose a word that is possible? 

We can try to fix S in position 1? And see?

Possible words? For pattern S ? ? E R? 
With S at 1? 
Valid words: 
- ""SAYER"": but A excluded? 
- ""SABER"": A? excluded?
- ""SUPER"": S U P E R? 
  1:S, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R -> but avoids excluded? And letters U and P? 
Not excluded? 
Valid word? 

Similarly: ""SOWER"": S O W E R -> O excluded? 
""SHER"": not 5 letters? 
""SEWER"": S E W E R -> but E repeated? At position 2? We know E is only at 4? So should not be at 2? Therefore, duplicated E? 

But we don't know? Perhaps? 

But ""SUPER"": S U P E R? 
Positions: 
1:S, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R -> 
As above? 

But let me see? 

Now? Similarly? For pattern ? S ? E R? With S at 2? 
Example: ""USHER"": U S H E R -> 
1:U, 2:S, 3:H, 4:E, 5:R -> 
Valid? 

Also? 

But we don't know? 

Now? How to resolve? 

We can guess ""super""? Which has S at position 1? And if wrong? Then S must be at position 2? 

Similarly? 

But also? We can choose a word that respects both? 

However? We have only 3 guesses left? (since fourth guess)? 

Therefore? We can guess?

I think ""super"" is a good candidate? Because? 
- It places S at position 1? Which we haven't tested? 
- If S is in position 1? Then it might be ✓? 
- Or if not? Then S must be at position 2? 
- Also? It introduces U and P? 

Similarly? 

But let me see? We know? 

Actually? We can also try a word without S? But we must include S? Because? Actually? We don't have to? But if we exclude S? We might get feedback that S is missing? But we know S is present? So we must include S? 

Therefore? 

So? Guess ""super""? 

But? If S is at position 2? Then ""super"" would have S at 1? Wrong? Then we will get S(-)? Meaning S is present? But at wrong position? Then we know S must be at position 2? 

Similarly? 

Then? 

Also? We might find? 

Another candidate: ""usher""? Which has S at position 2? 

Why one over the other? 

We don't know? 

Also? Notice: in ""super"", we have P? And U? New letters? 

Similarly? 

We can choose? 

But? Perhaps we want to test the other possibility? 

Actually? Since we don't know? We might guess one? And then based on feedback? 

I think? That's the best? 

Let me choose ""super""? 

Therefore? Fourth guess: ""super""? 

But? Alternatively? 

We have? 

After? 

Yes? 

So? 

Therefore? 

<guess>super</guess> 

But let me confirm the format? 

Final decision: ""super""### Reasoning Based on Feedback

**Feedback Analysis:**
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: `C` (absent), `R` (present but wrong position), `A` (absent), `N` (absent), `E` (present but wrong position).  
  → **Key Insights**: `R` and `E` are in the word. Avoid `C`, `A`, `N`.  
- **Guess 2 (tires)**: `T` (absent), `I` (absent), `R` (present but wrong position), `E` (correct in position 4), `S` (present but wrong position).  
  → **Key Insights**: `R` is not in position 3. `E` is fixed at position 4. `S` is present but not in position 5. Avoid `T`, `I`.  
- **Guess 3 (loser)**: `L` (absent), `O` (absent), `S` (present but wrong position), `E` (correct), `R` (correct).  
  → **Key Insights**: `S` is not in position 3. `E` (position 4) and `R` (position 5) are fixed. Avoid `L`, `O`.  

**Constraints Summary:**
- **Fixed positions**: Position 4 = `E`, Position 5 = `R`.  
- **Confirmed present**: `S` must be in position 1 or 2 (as it cannot be in 3, 4, or 5).  
- **Absent letters**: `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I`, `L`, `O` must be excluded.  
- **Unknowns**: Letters for positions 1 and 2 (one of which is `S`), and position 3.  

**Strategy for Next Guess (Try 4/6):**
- Target resolving `S`'s position: Test it in **position 1** since position 2 is also possible.  
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., `U`, `P`) to gain more information.  
- Prioritize words matching the pattern `_ _ _ E R` with `S` in position 1 and avoiding excluded letters.  

**Ideal Word: `SUPER`**  
- Structure: `S` (position 1), `U` (position 2), `P` (position 3), `E` (position 4), `R` (position 5).  
- **Why?**  
  - Tests `S` in position 1 (untested; if wrong, `S` must be in position 2).  
  - Covers `U` and `P` (common unused letters; high frequency).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters and aligns with position constraints.  
  - Maximizes info: Feedback on `S` and new letters (`U`, `P`) will pinpoint word structure.  

If `SUPER` is incorrect, feedback on `S` will confirm if it belongs in position 2. Position 3 (`P`) and new letters will help narrow the next guess.

Actually, it could be in 5 too, because the feedback only says wrong position, not that it can\'t be in 5. But note: the feedback for R says ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, position 5 is available because it was not tried for R. However, E was in position 5 and we know E is present but not in position 5? No: wait, the feedback for E says it is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1,2,3,4? And similarly, R can be in positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, positions 1,3,4 are common for both? Let me clarify:\n\nThe secret word has letters: R and E (and three others) and excludes C, A, N.\n\nWe must avoid:\n- Using C, A, N anywhere.\n- Placing R in position 2 (since that was wrong).\n- Placing E in position 5 (since that was wrong).\n\nWe also don\'t know the other letters. We need to choose a word that includes R and E, and avoids C,A,N.\n\nCommon letters: Let\'s try to pick a word that includes other common letters like T, O, I, L, S, etc.\n\nSince R is present, we can try words that start with R? Or have R in another spot.\n\nAlso, note that the secret word doesn\'t have A, so words with A should be avoided.\n\nLet me think of words that include R and E, and without C,A,N.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n1. Words starting with R: But we don\'t know if R is first. But we can try? However, we should avoid having R in position 2? Actually, for our next guess, we can put R anywhere except position 2? Or we could? Actually, we can put R anywhere we have not yet ruled out. The feedback tells us only that position 2 is incorrect for R. So R could be in 1,3,4,5? But note: we also have E that must be placed not in position 5.\n\nBut wait: the secret word has E somewhere else? So in our next guess, we don\'t want to put E in position 5 again? Actually, we are allowed, but it might give redundant information? So we should avoid placing E in position 5 because we already know it\'s not there? Similarly, we should avoid placing R in position 2.\n\nSo for our second guess, let\'s avoid:\n- Putting R in position 2\n- Putting E in position 5\n\nAlso, the word must not contain C, A, N.\n\nWe have to guess a word that includes R and E? Actually, not necessarily? Wait no, we know R and E are in the word? Actually, from the feedback, R and E are present? So yes, they must be in the word? Therefore, every subsequent guess must include R and E? But we don\'t know how many times? So we assume they appear at least once.\n\nNow, we also don\'t know any other letters.\n\nWe can try a word that uses other common letters? Like T, O, I, L, S.\n\nPossible words:\n\nConsider: ""ROTATE"" -> too long? We need 5 letters. And it has A? Which is ruled out? Also has T? But A is excluded? So no A allowed? So ""ROTATE"" has A? So not allowed.\n\nOther words:\n\n- ""STORE"": \n  - S, T, O, R, E.\n  - Does it include R? Yes. E? Yes.\n  - Avoids C, A, N? Yes.\n  - Position: \n    - R is placed in position 4? And we are avoiding position 2? We are not placing R in position 2? Here R is in 4? That\'s new.\n    - E is placed in position 5? But we must avoid? Because E is in position 5? But feedback on E said E(-) meaning it\'s present but not in position 5? So putting E in position 5 is not allowed? Actually, we can put it? But we already know that position 5 is wrong? So if we put it there, we expect a ""-"" if E is still in the word? But we know it is? So we might get a ""-"" again? Alternatively, we might get a ""x"" if the secret word had two E\'s and we haven\'t tried E in other positions? Actually, no: we know there\'s at least one E? But we should put E in a different position to try to find its correct spot? Therefore, we should avoid position 5? So let\'s not put E in position 5.\n\nSo avoid:\n- Letters: C, A, N\n- Position 2: R?\n- Position 5: E?\n\nAlternatively, we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4? And then we avoid R in position 2? Position 2 can be any letter? Actually, position 2 can be any letter? But R cannot be there? Only that R was in position 2 last time? So we can put E in position 2? Yes, because last time E was not in position 5? But we haven\'t tested position 2 for E? So yes, we can put E in position 2? But we know that R was in position 2? But R was taken as absent? Actually, no: R is present? But we put R in position 2? But the feedback said it\'s in the word but not in position 2? So we think R is not in position 2? And E? We don\'t know? Maybe E is in position 2? We don\'t know? It could be? So let\'s try to put E in a position we haven\'t tried? Currently, we tried E only in position 5? So positions 1,2,3,4? We can try one? Similarly, R: we tried in position 2? So we can try R in 1,3,4,5? But note: position 5? We also tried E in 5? So R can be in 5? Because E was tried in 5? So we can try.\n\nBut we might want to test different letters? We haven\'t tried? Also, we don\'t know if there might be other letters? So let\'s choose a word that uses new common letters? Such as T, O, I, L, S.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""tires"": T, I, R, E, S -> no C,A,N? Yes. E is in position 4? Not 5. R is in position 3? Not 2? So good! But wait: positions?\n  - T in 1st\n  - I in 2nd -> we don\'t know? We don\'t have info? But we haven\'t ruled out? \n  - R in 3rd: not 2nd? Previously R was in 2nd? So now we are trying R in 3rd? Which is new.\n  - E in 4th? Previously E was in 5th? Now we are trying E in 4th? Which is new.\n\nAlternative: ""robes""? But it has B? Maybe? Also, E in position 5? We wanted to avoid? \n- robes: R, O, B, E, S -> E in position 5? Avoid? So better avoid position 5 for E? \n\nSo ""tires"" seems good? But let me see: what common letters we cover? \nIt includes T, I, R, E, S? That\'s 5 distinct letters? And we exclude C,A,N? Also, we are testing S? Which is common? \n\nAnother option: ""stern"": \nS, T, E, R, N -> but N is excluded? We can\'t because N was marked as absent? So ""tires"" doesn\'t have N? Good? \n\nAlso, ""slope"": S, L, O, P, E? But it doesn\'t include R? We know R must be in the word? Why? Because R was marked as present? And we haven\'t found the word? So we must include R? Otherwise, we might not get information? However, if we don\'t include R, then if the new guess has no R and we get feedback that shows R is there? Actually, the feedback will tell us? But we are trying to guess quickly? And we know R is in? So we must include R? Similarly E?\n\nTherefore, in the second guess, we must include both R and E? Yes? Because we know they are present? And also avoid C,A,N? \n\nWe can try ""tries"": T, R, I, E, S? \nThis word has R in position 2? But wait: we must avoid putting R in position 2? Because last time R was in position 2? And the feedback said it\'s present but not in that position? Therefore, putting R in position 2 again? Then the feedback would say ""-"" again? And we learned nothing new? So that wastes a slot? So we should avoid putting R in position 2? Similarly, avoid E in position 5? \n\nSo ""tries"": Positions? \n1: T? \n2: R? -> but we are putting R in position 2? Which we already know is wrong? We expect a ""-"" again? \n3: I? \n4: E? \n5: S? \n\nWe are avoiding E in position 5? But here E is in position 4? So that\'s okay? But R is in position 2? Which we shouldn\'t? Actually, we have to avoid position 2 for R? So we cannot use ""tries"" because we are repeating a known wrong position? We want to rule out new positions? So we avoid?\n\nTherefore, ""tires"": \n1: T? \n2: I? \n3: R? -> not in position 2? So new position? \n4: E? -> not in position 5? So new position? \n5: S? \n\nSo that\'s good? \n\nAlternatively, ""resit"": \n1: R? \n2: E? -> but we haven\'t tested position 2? We know R was wrong in 2? But E? We haven\'t tested E in 2? So we can? But is it a real word? I think RESIT is valid? \n\nBut let me think: We know R is present? Putting R in position 1? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? Similarly? \n\nBut we have two positions: R can be in 1,3,4,5? And E in 1,2,3,4? \n\nIf we put R in 1? Then we might get ✓? Or -? Or x if by mistake? But we know R is in? So ✓ or -? \n\nSimilarly, for E? \n\nIn ""resit"": \nR in 1? \nE in 2? \nS in 3? \nI in 4? \nT in 5? \n\nWe avoid: \n- Letters: C,A,N? Yes? \n- R not in 2? Yes? \n- E not in 5? Yes? \n\nSo we are testing R in position 1 and E in position 2? Both new? \n\nBut which one is better? \nWe get to test two new positions? \n\nAlternatively, ""store"": \nS, T, O, R, E -> \nR in position 4? \nE in position 5? But we avoid E in position 5? So that doesn\'t help? Therefore, we skip.\n\nSo between ""tires"" and ""resit""? Both are valid?\n\nAnother candidate: ""arise""? But has A? Ruled out? Not allowed.\n\n""opera""? Has O,P,E,R,A? A? Excluded? So not allowed.\n\n""house"": H,O,U,S,E? Doesn\'t have R? So we don\'t include R? Then the feedback for R? We know R is in the word? So if we don\'t include R? We get a problem? The feedback will tell us that R is still missing? Meaning? For each letter? So if we don\'t include R? Then the position where we don\'t have R? But for letters? We get feedback for each letter? Specifically? For ""house"", \nH: new? \nO: new? \nU: new? \nS: new? \nE: and E? We know E? But position? E is in position 5? Which we already tested? And was wrong? So we put E again in 5? So we expect ""-"" for E? Because in wrong position? Because we know E is in the word but position 5 is wrong? So we expect ""-""? \nAnd R? We didn\'t include? So the feedback would say:\n- For H: could be ✓, - , or x? \nSimilarly for O,U,S? \nThen for E: might be ""-"" again? \nBut we didn\'t test R? So what? We know R is present? So we need to include R? Otherwise, we won\'t get information about R\'s position? \n\nTherefore, we must include R? And E? Because they are confirmed? \n\nSo words without R? Are wasted? Similarly without E? \n\nTherefore, we stick to including both? \n\nSo let me choose: \nI am thinking of ""resit""? Which has R and E? \n\nBut note: the word might have double letters? We don\'t know? \n\nBut for now? \n\nActually, ""tires"" is the same letters as ""tries""? But in different order? Without repeating known wrong positions? \n\nSummary of candidates:\n\n1. ""tires"": \n   - T, I, R, E, S \n   - R in pos 3 (new) \n   - E in pos 4 (new) \n\n2. ""resit"": \n   - R in pos 1 (new) \n   - E in pos 2 (new) \n\nWhich one is better? \n\nI am inclined to ""tires""? Because position 1 has T? Which is a common letter? And position 2 has I? Which is common vowel? But also ""resit"" has R as first? which is less common? Actually, many words start with T? \n\nAnother candidate: ""stern"": but has N? Not allowed? \n\n""brize""?

R can be in positions 1 or 5? Because remaining positions are 1, 5? Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. E is fixed at 4? So R must be in one of 1,5? Actually, also? What about position 2 and 3 we know R is not? And position 4 is E? So R must be either in position 1 or position 5? Unless there are multiple letters? But we haven\'t had any indication? But we don\'t know? There might be two R\'s? But let\'s assume no duplicates? Typically? We might need to consider? But for now? \n\nSimilarly, S:\n- From ""crane"": we tried S? Actually, we didn\'t? ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E? No S? So first time we see S? Then ""tires"" had S at position 5? Feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not at position 5? So S must be in positions 1,2,3? But note: position 4 is taken by E? So available positions: 1,2,3? And R is also to be placed in either 1 or 5? But S? So they might share? Actually, S could be in 1,2, or 3? And R in 1 or 5? So conflict? Only at position 1? That is, if R is in 1, then S cannot be in 1? So S must be in 2 or 3? And if R is in 5, then S in 1,2,3 anywhere? \n\nCurrently, we don\'t know the fifth letter? We have: \n- Position 4: E (locked)\n- R must be in 1 or 5?\n- S in 2,3? Or if R in 5 then S in 1,2,3? But we also have two other letters? We know the secret word has 5 distinct?

But let\'s avoid assuming? \n\nKnown letters: \n- R: present (in 1 or 5)\n- S: present (in wherever) and not in 5? \n- E: at 4.\n- And we know the word has two more letters? Because we haven\'t found all? \n\nExcluded? Total excluded: C, A, N, T, I.\n\nAlso, we must avoid using these?\n\nWe need to guess a word that:\n1. Must include R and S (they are present).\n2. Must have E at position 4.\n3. Avoids C,A,N,T,I.\n4. Must have two more letters? And we don\'t know? \n\nFurthermore, we have constraints on R and S positions:\n- R: must not be in position 2 or 3? And since position 4 is E? So only options: position 1 or 5? \n- S: must not be in position 5? And we haven\'t tried positions 1,2,3? So S must be in 1,2, or 3? But if R is in position 1, then S must be in 2 or 3? If R in 5, S can be in 1,2,3? \n\nWe also would like to test other positions?\n\nWe don\'t know the fifth (third) letter? And another letter? We know the secret word has 5 letters? We have E fixed? And R? And S? And two more? So two unknowns?\n\nWe need to guess a word that fits these constraints? \n\nLet\'s look for words with pattern: \n- Position 4: E\n- Position 1: either R or something else? But if R is in 1? Then word starts with R? Or if not? \n\nPossible words:\n\nConsider R at position 1? Then S in 2 or 3? \n\nOptions:\nR at 1, E at 4: \n- Words like: R? ? E? E? \nBut we have S? \n\nFor example: \nROSE? But O? And S? Position 5 must be something? \nR O S E? Wait: positions: \n1: R? \n2: O? \n3: S? \n4: E? \n5: ? But we have S at position 3? Then the fifth letter? Also, let\'s see: does it avoid C,A,N,T,I? Yes? Then what? \nBut we haven\'t fixed the fifth letter? \n\nOther words: R with E at fourth? \n\nBut alternatively, R at position 5? Then the word ends with R? And position 4 is E? So ...E R? \n\nNow, we want to test positions? Also, we haven\'t tested letters? \n\nCommon letters remaining? Excluding C,A,N,T,I? Remaining letters: \nB, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common letters? For example: O, L, U, P, etc. \n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nCase 1: R in position 1? Then S in position 2 or 3? \n- If S in position 2: R S ? E ? \n- Possibilities: R S _ E _ ? \n  Words: R S (letter) E (letter) -> RS?E?\n  Possible: ROSE (but O is in? But O? Then E? Then? Wait: R O S E -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E -> but in this, S is at position 3? Then fifth letter? ROSE? Not 5 letters? Wait, ROSE is 4? But 5-letter words: ROSED? Not valid? \n  Actually: ROBES? But we avoid B? Maybe? Or wait, we haven\'t ruled out? \n\nBut let\'s search:\nPossible words: \n- ""ROLES"": \n  1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S? -> but we know S? And we have S at position 5? But S cannot be in position 5? Because from ""tires"", S was at 5 and feedback said - meaning wrong position? So position 5 is invalid for S? Therefore, if R at 1? We cannot have S at 5? \n\nAlso, ""tires"" feedback: S(-) meaning S is not at 5? So in any guess? We avoid S in position 5? \n\nTherefore, for R in 1? We must put S in 2 or 3? \n\nIf R in 1, S in 2: pattern R S ? E ? \nPossible words? \nRS?E? \nExamples: \n- R S ? E ? \n""rs"" are rare? Maybe ""ruse""? But we know E at 4? So R U S E ...? Wait: position 4 is E? And E must be at 4? So R S ? E ? \nSo positions: 1:R,2:S,3:?,4:E,5:? \nThen the word? Must be 5 letters? Valid: RSLEE? Not valid? ""rise""? Wait: ""rise"" is 4 letters? \nWe need 5-letter words? \nFor 1:R,2:S,3:?,4:E,5:? \nValid words? \n- ""RUSES"": But S appears twice? And at position 5? Also S? But already excluded? \nOr ""RASED"": But A? Excluded? \n""RUSLE"": Not valid? \nPerhaps no common words? \n\nAlternatively: R at 1, S at position 3: pattern R ? S E ? \nExamples: \n1:R,2:?,3:S,4:E,5:? \nValid words: \n- ""ROUSE"": R O U S E -> yes? \nLetters: O,U -> not excluded? \nAlso, ""REUSE"": R E U S E -> but E repeated? And E is at position 2? Duplicated E? Then for position 2: E? But the secret word? We know E is at position 4? But there might be two E? \nActually, the feedback might show? \nBut let\'s see if it\'s possible? \n\nSimilarly, ""raise"": has A? Excluded? \n""rouse"": R O U S E -> \n1:R,2:O,3:U,4:S? Wait, S? But we need E at 4? And S at position? \n- Actually: ""rouse"": R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> no E at 4? That doesn\'t work? \nWe need E at 4? So ""rouse""? Cannot? \n\nHow about ""RESET""? But R at 1? Position 4: E? So R E S E T? \n1:R, 2:E, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T? \nBut T is excluded? \nNot valid? \n\nAnother word: ""RIPES""? I excluded? \n\nSo perhaps none without excluded letters? \n\nAlternative: R at position 5? Pattern: ? ? ? E R? \nThen S? Can be at 1,2,3? \n\nPattern: _ _ _ E R? \nAnd S must be in 1,2,3? \n\nNow, words: ... E R? \n\nExamples: \n- ""__SER"" -> then S at position 3? \n  For example: ""POSER"", ""LOSER"", ""HOSER"", ""ROGER"" is R O G E R -> repeated R? Duplicated R? But we don\'t know if possible? \nBut R? We must include R? And if R is at 5? Then there is only one R? \nSo words must have S somewhere? And E at 4? R at 5? \n\nPattern: _ _ S E R? \nThen first two letters: two more letters? For example: ""PASER"" -> has A? Excluded? \n""USER"" -> but 4 letters? \n5-letter: ""HOSER"": H O S E R -> \nPositions: \n1: H? \n2: O? \n3: S? \n4: E? \n5: R? \nThis works? \nAvoids C,A,N,T,I? Yes? \nAnd R is at position 5? Which is allowed? \nS is at position 3? Which is not 5? So okay? \nBut we haven\'t tried O and H before? \n\nAlternatively: S at position 1: pattern S _ _ E R? \nWords: ""S_ _ER"" \nExamples: ""SOWER"", ""SUPER"", ""SABER"" (has A? excluded), ""SHEER"" (double E? and E at 4 but also other E?), ""SHOER""? Not common? \n\nS at position 2: pattern _ S ? E R? \nFor example: ""ASPER"" (has A? excluded), ""ISLER""? Not common? \n\nSo ""HOSER"" seems good? \n\nBut let me see: common letters? \n\nAnother pattern: without S? But we must include S? Wait? \n\nWe know:\n- R must be in 1 or 5?\n- E at 4?\n- S must be in 1,2,3? Except if R in 1? Then S cannot in 1? \n\nBut also, we don\'t know the other letters? \n\nWe can also consider: maybe S is the other possible position? \n\nBut let me try: we need to guess? And there is also the possibility that R is in position 1? And we haven\'t found? \n\nMaybe we can try a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to commit? \n\nAnother idea: we know the word has S? But not found? \n\nWe can try ""loser"": L O S E R -> \nPositions: \n1: L? \n2: O? \n3: S? \n4: E? \n5: R? \nPattern: S at position 3? And R at 5? \nAvoids all forbidden letters? \n\nBut is it valid? Yes? \nAlso, ""loser"" avoids C,A,N,T,I? \n\nSimilarly, we can use ""homer"": H O M E R? \nBut E at 4? R at 5? \nS? Where? Doesn\'t include S? Then feedback? We know S must be in the word? Why? Because we had ""tires"" guess? S(-)? So S must be in the word? So if we don\'t include S? Then feedback? We would get S missing? But we know S is present? So we must include S? \n\nTherefore, ""loser"" has S? At position 3? \n\n""loser"": L,O,S,E,R -> yes? \nSo: \n- Position 3: S? Which we haven\'t tried? \n- Position 5: R? Which we tried? But we know R is present? And we are testing a new position? Because R was not tried in 5? \n\nPreviously? We tried R only in positions 2 and 3? And wrong? And E is known at 4? \nSo R in 5 is untested? \n\nAlso, S? Tried in position 5? Found wrong? But now S in 3? Untested? And we expect S to be there? Maybe? \n\nCommon word? Yes? \n\nAlternatively? Another word: ""muser"": M U S E R? \nAlso? \n\nBut ""loser"" is more common? \n\nAnother: ""poser"": P O S E R? \n\nAll valid? \n\nNow? Which one to choose? \n\nWe can choose ""loser""? It includes L and O? New letters? \n\nAlso? Notice: in ""tires"", we have E at 4? That was correct? So we can rely? \n\nTherefore, guess ""loser""? \n\nBut we have R at 5? And S at 3? \n\nAlso? If it\'s not? We get feedback? \n\nAnother candidate: if R is in position 1? Then we need S in 2 or 3? And E at 4? \n\nFor example: word ""robed""? But we avoid? Or ""rubel""? Not common? \n\n""RISEN""? Has I? Excluded? \n\n""RESOD""? R E S O D? Then: 1:R,2:E,3:S,4:O,5:D? But E at 4? But we have E at 4? Fixed? So position 2:E? Then? \nWait? Our pattern? If R at 1? Then we can have E at 4? But position 2? We haven\'t tested for E? Actually, we know E is at 4? So position 2 should not be E? Because E is only at 4? We don\'t know? In secret word? E is only at 4? Or could be elsewhere? Actually, the feedback? For ""crane"": E(-) meaning E is present but not at 5? Then for ""tires"": E(✓) at 4? That\'s correct? So E is fixed at 4? And there are no other E? So we must not put E elsewhere? \n\nTherefore, any word must have E only at position 4? \n\nTherefore, for R at position 1? We cannot have E at 2? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nSo pattern for R at 1: \n1:R, 2:?, 3: (S or ?) ,4:E, 5:? \nAnd S must be in 2 or 3? If in 3: R ? S E ? \nValid? \n1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:P? ""rosep""? Not valid? \n1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:M? ""rosem""? No? \n1:R, 2:U, 3:S, 4:E, 5:D? ""rused""? Not common? \nBut ""ruse""? Is 4 letters? \nHow about ""RUSES""? But S twice? And E at 4? So R U S E S? Then positions: \n1:R,2:U,3:S,4:E,5:S -> but S at 3 and 5? But from ""tires"", we have S? And we know S? So if we use duplicate? Then feedback? \n\nBut for now? We assume no duplicate? Because we haven\'t seen? \n\nActually? We don\'t know? \n\nBut common words? \n\nTherefore? The better bet seems R in 5? And we choose ""loser""? \n\nAdditionally? We could try ""poser""? P O S E R? \n\nBut why? \n\nAlso? Note? We haven\'t used P,O,L? \n\nNow? Both ""loser"" and ""poser"" are valid? \n\nBut let\'s choose? \n\nActually? There is another constraint: the word must not contain any excluded letters? \n\nSo? \n\nI think ""loser"" is good? \n\nTherefore? Third guess: loser\n\nBut wait? The word ""loser""? It includes L, O, S, E, R? \nS is at position 3? And we haven\'t tested S? And R at 5? \n\nExpected feedback? \n\nIf the secret word? For example? \n\nPerhaps? \n\nAlternatively? We can choose a word that rules out the other possibility? But it\'s fine? \n\nLet me try? \n\nSo guess? ""loser""? \n\nBut wait? Another word: ""SUPER""? But it starts with S? Pattern S _ _ E R? \nIf S at 1? Then word: S U P E R? \nPositions: \n1:S? \n2: ? \n3:? \n4:E? \n5:R? \nNow? In this? S at first? Which hasn\'t been tested? \nR at last? \nBut U and P? \n\nAlso? Avoids excluded letters? \n\nBut we know? From ""tires"", I was excluded? \n\nNow? ""SUPER""? S,U,P,E,R? \n\nBut P? Not tested? \n\nBut? Also? R at 5? \n\nCompared to ""loser""? L,O,S,E,R? \n\nBoth seem fine? \n\nPerhaps ""super"" is shorter? \n\nBut? Actually? Let me see? \n\nBut? We also need to consider: in ""loser""? Position 3:S? And position 5:R? \n\nIn ""super""? Position 1:S? Then? \n\nWe could? But? \n\nBut? By guessing ""loser""? Or ""super""? \n\nBut? We have? \n\nI think we can go with ""loser"". \n\nTherefore: \n\n<guess>loser</guess> \n\nBut? Let\'s double-check? \n\nSummary: \n- Positions: We know position 4 must be E? \n- R: must be in 1 or 5? \n- S: must be in 1,2,3? \n- Avoid C,A,N,T,I? \n\nIn ""loser"": \n- Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:R \n- We are testing R in position 5? (and also S in position 3) \n\nIf the secret word has R in 5? Then we might get R✓? Or if not? Then wrong? \n\nWe\'ll see? \n\nAlternatively? If R is not in 5? Then we learn that R must be in 1? \n\nBut? For this guess? \n\nYes? \n\nSo? \n\nI choose ""loser"". \n\nBut? We still have to write? \n\nNote: We must include all? \n\nActually? Let me list the known? \n\nPerhaps? There are other constraints? \n\nIn the second guess ""tires""? We learned E(✓) at 4? \n\nAlso? R(-) at 3? \n\nNow? \n\nWe are guessing? \n\nI think? \n\nTherefore? \n\nFinal guess: loser### Reasoning for the Next Guess\n\nWe have two previous guesses with feedback:\n\n1. **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  \n   - `C`, `A`, `N` are absent from the secret word.  \n   - `R` is present but not in position 2.  \n   - `E` is present but not in position 5.  \n\n2. **Guess 2: tires → Feedback: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)**  \n   - `T` and `I` are absent.  \n   - `R` is present but not in position 3.  \n   - `E` is correct and fixed in position 4!  \n   - `S` is present but not in position 5.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed letters:**  \n  - `E` is locked at position 4.  \n  - `R` and `S` are present in the word.\n- **Absent letters:** `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I` must be avoided.  \n- **Position constraints for `R`:**  \n  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or 3 (from ""tires"").  \n  - Since position 4 is occupied by `E`, `R` must be in position 1 or 5 (*no duplicates inferred yet*).  \n- **Position constraints for `S`:**  \n  - Cannot be in position 5 (from ""tires"").  \n  - Must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  \n- **Unknowns:** Two letters remain unknown (besides `E`, `R`, `S`), with no duplicates implied.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Include `R` and `S`:** Both are confirmed present.  \n- **Position `R` correctly:** Prioritize testing `R` in position 1 or 5 to resolve its location.  \n- **Position `S` strategically:** Place `S` in an untested position (1, 2, or 3), avoiding position 5.  \n- **Introduce new, common letters:** Test high-frequency consonants/vowels not yet evaluated (e.g., `L`, `O`, `M`) to gather more information.  \n- **Avoid guessing `R` in position 5 if `S` is in position 1:** Both letters share possible positions, but feedback will clarify conflicts.  \n\nIdeal word suggestions:\n- **`loser`**:  \n  - `L` (position 1), `O` (position 2), `S` (position 3), `E` (position 4), `R` (position 5).  \n  - Tests `R` in position 5 and `S` in position 3 (both new positions).  \n  - Avoids all excluded letters (`C`/`A`/`N`/`T`/`I`).  \n  - Introduces `L` and `O` for additional coverage.  \n- **Alternative: `poser` or `super`**  \n  - Similar pattern but less common letters; `loser` is prioritized as it follows the constraints elegantly.\n\n### Why `loser`?\n- If correct: Wins the game (but unlikely this early).  \n- If partial: Feedback on `R` (position 5) will confirm if `R` belongs at the end or start (position 1).  \n- Feedback on `S` (position 3) and new letters (`L`, `O`) will simplify next guesses.\n\n<guess>loser</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tires -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)\nGuess 3: loser -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from three guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nSecond guess: ""tires"" -> T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)\nThird guess: ""loser"" -> L(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓) R(✓)\n\nInterpretation:\n\nFrom guess 1:\n- C, A, N: absent.\n- R: present but not in position 2.\n- E: present but not in position 5.\n\nFrom guess 2:\n- T, I: absent.\n- R: present but not in position 3.\n- E: correct at position 4 (so secret word has E at position 4).\n- S: present but not in position 5.\n\nFrom guess 3:\n- L, O: absent.\n- S: present but not in position 3 (since guessed at position 3, feedback S(-)).\n- E: correct at position 4 (confirmed).\n- R: correct at position 5 (so secret word has R at position 5).\n\nNow, we know:\n- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5. So the pattern: _ _ _ E R\n- S is present in the word, but not in position 3 (from ""loser"") and not in position 5 (from ""tires""). So S must be in position 1 or 2? Because positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So for S? Only positions 1,2,3 are left? But we tried S at positions 5 (in ""tires"") and 3 (in ""loser""), both wrong. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2.\n\nAdditionally, we have excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, L, O.\n\nWe need to find the first three letters? Actually, the word is: ? ? ? E R, where position 4 is E, position 5 is R. And position 3 is not S? So position 3 must be another letter? And we don\'t know what?

We are given feedback from four guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Second guess: ""tires"" -> T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
Third guess: ""loser"" -> L(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓) R(✓)
Fourth guess: ""super"" -> S(✓) U(x) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)

Interpretation:

From the fourth guess ""super"":
- S is correct at position 1: so secret word starts with S.
- U is absent (x): so U is not in the word.
- P is absent (x): so P is not in the word.
- E is correct at position 4 (already known).
- R is correct at position 5 (already known).

So now we know:
- Secret word: S ? ? E R
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)
- We need to find positions 2 and 3.

Also, we know:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, L, O, U, P (from all feedback)
- Earlier, from ""crane"": R was present but not at 2? Actually, now we know R is at 5? So that constraint is solved.
- From ""tires"": S was present but not at 5? Now we know S is at 1? So constraint resolved.

For the middle positions (2 and 3), we have two letters to find? And they must not be any of the excluded letters.

We tried:
- In ""tires"": position 2 was I? But I is excluded? So not? 
- In ""loser"": position 2 was O? Excluded? Position 3 was S? But now S is at 1? So not?
- In ""super"": position 2 was U? Excluded? Position 3 was P? Excluded?

Therefore, positions 2 and 3 are two letters that are not in the excluded list and form a valid English word of the pattern S _ _ E R.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, L, O, U, P.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? But we need common ones?

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, ... etc.

We need to form words S ? ? E R.

Possible words: 
- ""SAYER"": but A? Excluded? No?
- ""SABER"": A? Excluded?
- ""SEWER"": S E W E R -> has E at position 2? But we know E is only at position 4? So duplicated E? Might be? But in feedback? For ""crane"", E was present? And at ""tires"", E was only at 4? Third guess ""loser"" didn't test E anywhere else? So could there be two E? Possibly? But let's see: ""SEWER"" would have E at position 2? Then if we guess? 

But ""SEWER"" is a word? Meaning: a person who uses a needle? Or something? It's 5 letters.

But E at position 2? Then E at position 4? So two E? Then the feedback for ""crane"" had E(-) meaning at least one E? But position 5? But we had E at 5? Then for ""tires"", E at 4? Then? Actually, we don't know? 

But if we consider? Now?

However? In ""SEWER"": 
Positions: 
1: S? 
2: E? 
3: W? 
4: E? 
5: R? 

Now? We are going to test? 

But we have a constraint? We know from ""super""? U and P? Excluded? 

But E? Not excluded? 

Therefore, possible? 

But we excluded A? But ""SEWER"" has no A? 

Also? 

Other words? 

""SEDER"": S E D E R? Similarly? 

But we are looking? 

Also? 

However? There are other words? Without duplicated E?

For example:
- ""SHYER"": but Y? 
- ""SHOER"": S H O E R -> but O? Excluded? 
- ""SKIER"": K? But I? Excluded? 
- ""SMEAR"": S M E A R -> A? Excluded? 
- ""SHEER"": S H E E R -> duplicated E? 
- ""SHEAR"": A? Excluded? 
- ""SHVER"": not word? 

What about?
- ""shoer"": but O excluded? 
- ""sizer"": Z? But I? Excluded? 
- ""saker"": K? 

But let me search? 

Another: ""SEVER"": S E V E R -> again duplicated E? 

Or ""SEAMER"": too long? 

Not? 

Perhaps? 

We need to pick a word that uses available letters? 

Since we don't know? We can choose one? 

But note: we have only a few letters left? 

Perhaps ""sheer""? 

But duplicated E? 

But I think? The secret word might be? 

Wait? 

Another idea: positions 2 and 3? We tested? 

In previous guesses? We haven't tested position 2? Actually? We tested I, O, U? All absent? So position 2 must be one of the remaining? 

Similarly? Position 3? We tested S? Then in ""loser""? We tested S? But wrong? Then in ""super""? We tested P? Wrong? So we tried? 

But? 

What letters? 

We can try? Let's pick? 

Given pattern? S ? ? E R? 

We can list possible words? 

Common? 
- ""SHEER"": S H E E R -> two E? Letters H and E? 
- ""SHAKER"": too long? 
- ""SHIER"": S H I E R -> I excluded? 
- ""SHOER"": O excluded? 
- ""SEWER"": S E W E R -> 
- ""SOWER"": O excluded? 
- ""SEVER"": S E V E R -> 
- ""SEDGE"": wrong pattern? S E D G E? Ends with E? Not R? 

What about? 
- ""seder"": S E D E R? (Jewish ritual feast? Or word?) 

But might be accepted? 

Similarly? 

But we avoid E at position 2? Or not? 

We don't know? 

Therefore? We might choose a word without E? But? 

But we know? 

Actually? In position 2? We haven't tested many? So we should choose? 

Perhaps? 

But also? We need to avoid E? Because we know E is at 4? But maybe duplicated E? 

We don't know? 

For efficiency? Since we only have two positions? We can try a word that tests common remaining letters? 

For example? 

Positions 2 and 3: need to be filled? 

We have excluded: A,C,I,L,N,O,P,T,U? 

Common remaining: H, M, D, F, G, K, etc? 

Now? We can form? 

If we try a word like ""SHMER""? Not valid? 

Or ""SHKER""? Same? 

Common words? 

Actually? There is ""shier""? But I? Excluded? 

""smear""? But A? Excluded? 

""sheer""? Might be our best candidate? 

Similarly? ""sheep""? But ends with P? We need R? 

No? 

Therefore? We must use? 

How about ""SMERK""? Not valid? 

Perhaps ""sweer""? Not common? 

I think? The only common options are words with duplicated E? 

Therefore? We guess ""sheer""? 

But? 

Note: from ""crane"" we had E? Which was not at 5? Now we have E at 4? But we don't know about position 2? 

But if E is at 2? Then in ""sheer"": 

1: S? 
2: E? 
3: E? 
4: E? 
5: R? 

That's not? ""SHEER"" is S H E E R? So positions: 
1: S? 
2: H? 
3: E? 
4: E? 
5: R? 

But we have E at 4? So position 4 is E? Correct? Then position 3? E? Then two E? 

In feedback? For ""crane"": E(-) meaning E is present? But that could be? 

But we also have to fit the pattern? 

Therefore? 

But in ""sheer""? We have E at 3 and 4? 

Now? But our known pattern: S ? ? E R? Position 4 is E? Position 5 is R? So position 3 cannot be E? Wait? Actually? Position 4 is E? But we don't know? 

But position 3? We haven't fixed? 

By guessing ""sheer""? We can see? 

Therefore? 

But let me see? 

Perhaps? 

Alternative? 

Another word: ""shyer"": S H Y E R? 
Positions: 
1:S, 2:H, 3:Y, 4:E, 5:R? 
Valid word? 
Avoids excluded? 

So? 

Letters: H, Y? 

Then? 

And Y is not excluded? 

Similarly? 

Is ""shyer"" valid? Yes? 

Meaning: a horse that shies easily? Or something? 

So? 

Therefore? 

We can guess ""shyer""? 

And H and Y? New letters? 

Similarly? 

We can choose? 

Another: ""skier"": but I? Excluded? 
""sheer"": has duplicated E? But we don't know? 
""shyer"": has Y? 

Also? 

We can try ""sizer"": but I? Excluded? 

Therefore? 

Let me choose ""shyer""? 

But? Perhaps? 

I notice: we haven't tested H and Y? 

But also? 

Similarly? 

So? 

Therefore? Fourth guess? Was ""super""? Now fifth? Guess ""shyer""? 

Fifth guess? 

But? Let's write: 

So? Guess: ""shyer""? 

But? Format? 

So? 

Conclusion? 

I think? 

Alternatively? We can guess? 

But? 

Given? We have S and E and R? But? 

Perhaps? 

But? 

So? 

<guess>shyer</guess> 

But let me confirm? 

Pattern: S H Y E R? 

Avoids excluded? 

Yes? 

Therefore? 

Fifth guess: shyer### Reasoning for Guess 5

**Feedback Recap (Crucial Constraints):**
- **Position 1**: `S` (fixed, per guess 4).  
- **Position 4**: `E` (fixed, per guess 2).  
- **Position 5**: `R` (fixed, per guess 3).  
- **Absent Letters**: `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I`, `L`, `O`, `U`, `P` (cleared via feedback).  

**Unknowns:**  
- Positions **2** and **3** need letters that:  
  (a) Are valid English letters not in the excluded list.  
  (b) Form a real 5-letter word `S _ _ E R`.  
  (c) Must include potential letters like `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `K`, `M`, `Y`, etc.  

**Strategic Approach:**  
- Since positions 2 and 3 are untested for most letters (only `I`, `O`, `U`, `P` tested and excluded), use a word with common high-frequency consonants/vowels.  
- Prioritize testing `H` (high frequency) and `Y` (less common but possible) to cover ground quickly.  
- Avoid using `E` in positions 2 or 3 (though duplicates like `S E E E R` are possible but unlikely given feedback hasn’t hinted at it).  

**Best Candidate: `SHYER`**  
- Word Breakdown: `S` (1) + `H` (2) + `Y` (3) + `E` (4) + `R` (5).  
- **Why?**  
  - Tests `H` in position 2 and `Y` in position 3 – both new, unexcluded letters.  
  - Fits pattern `S _ _ E R` perfectly while avoiding all excluded letters.  
  - Common enough to be valid (e.g., ""one who shies"").  
  - If incorrect, feedback will dramatically narrow options for the final guess.  

**Alternatives Considered:**  
- `SHEER` (S + H + E + E + R): Less ideal as it forces a duplicate `E` in position 3, which hasn’t been hinted at.  
- `SEWER` (S + E + W + E + R): Duplicate `E` in position 2 and unexcluded `W`; likely word but redundant `E` test.  
- Other words like `SHMER`/`SKYER` are invalid.  

Given only 2 unknowns and limited guesses left, `SHYER` optimally balances common letters and pattern alignment.

</think>
### Thought Process
Based on the accumulated feedback:
- **Position 1**: Must be `S` (✓ from guess 4).
- **Position 4**: Must be `E` (✓ from guess 2 and confirmed).
- **Position 5**: Must be `R` (✓ from guess 3 and confirmed).
- **Constraints on positions 2 and 3**:
  - Must not be any excluded letters (`C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I`, `L`, `O`, `U`, `P`).
  - `S` is fixed at position 1, so positions 2 and 3 must be new letters.
  - Common letters like `H`, `Y`, `K`, `D` are untested and plausible.
- **Pattern**: `S _ _ E R`.
- **Options**:
  - Common valid words include `SHYER` (tested here), `SHEER` (duplicate E), or `SKIER` (excluded `I`). 
  - Prioritizing untested high-frequency consonants (`H`) and vowels (`Y`) maximizes information gain. If `SHYER` fails, feedback will isolate the missing letter(s) for the final guess.

<guess>shyer</guess>",shyer,"We are given feedback from four guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Second guess: ""tires"" -> T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
Third guess: ""loser"" -> L(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓) R(✓)
Fourth guess: ""super"" -> S(✓) U(x) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)

Interpretation:

From the fourth guess ""super"":
- S is correct at position 1: so secret word starts with S.
- U is absent (x): so U is not in the word.
- P is absent (x): so P is not in the word.
- E is correct at position 4 (already known).
- R is correct at position 5 (already known).

So now we know:
- Secret word: S ? ? E R
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)
- We need to find positions 2 and 3.

Also, we know:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, L, O, U, P (from all feedback)
- Earlier, from ""crane"": R was present but not at 2? Actually, now we know R is at 5? So that constraint is solved.
- From ""tires"": S was present but not at 5? Now we know S is at 1? So constraint resolved.

For the middle positions (2 and 3), we have two letters to find? And they must not be any of the excluded letters.

We tried:
- In ""tires"": position 2 was I? But I is excluded? So not? 
- In ""loser"": position 2 was O? Excluded? Position 3 was S? But now S is at 1? So not?
- In ""super"": position 2 was U? Excluded? Position 3 was P? Excluded?

Therefore, positions 2 and 3 are two letters that are not in the excluded list and form a valid English word of the pattern S _ _ E R.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, L, O, U, P.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? But we need common ones?

Fifth guess: shyer### Reasoning for Guess 5

**Feedback Recap (Crucial Constraints):**
- **Position 1**: `S` (fixed, per guess 4).  
- **Position 4**: `E` (fixed, per guess 2).  
- **Position 5**: `R` (fixed, per guess 3).  
- **Absent Letters**: `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I`, `L`, `O`, `U`, `P` (cleared via feedback).  

**Unknowns:**  
- Positions **2** and **3** need letters that:  
  (a) Are valid English letters not in the excluded list.  
  (b) Form a real 5-letter word `S _ _ E R`.  
  (c) Must include potential letters like `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `K`, `M`, `Y`, etc.  

**Strategic Approach:**  
- Since positions 2 and 3 are untested for most letters (only `I`, `O`, `U`, `P` tested and excluded), use a word with common high-frequency consonants/vowels.  
- Prioritize testing `H` (high frequency) and `Y` (less common but possible) to cover ground quickly.  
- Avoid using `E` in positions 2 or 3 (though duplicates like `S E E E R` are possible but unlikely given feedback hasn’t hinted at it).  

**Best Candidate: `SHYER`**  
- Word Breakdown: `S` (1) + `H` (2) + `Y` (3) + `E` (4) + `R` (5).  
- **Why?**  
  - Tests `H` in position 2 and `Y` in position 3 – both new, unexcluded letters.  
  - Fits pattern `S _ _ E R` perfectly while avoiding all excluded letters.  
  - Common enough to be valid (e.g., ""one who shies"").  
  - If incorrect, feedback will dramatically narrow options for the final guess.  

**Alternatives Considered:**  
- `SHEER` (S + H + E + E + R): Less ideal as it forces a duplicate `E` in position 3, which hasn’t been hinted at.  
- `SEWER` (S + E + W + E + R): Duplicate `E` in position 2 and unexcluded `W`; likely word but redundant `E` test.  
- Other words like `SHMER`/`SKYER` are invalid.  

Given only 2 unknowns and limited guesses left, `SHYER` optimally balances common letters and pattern alignment.

<guess>shyer</guess>### Thought Process
Based on the accumulated feedback:
- **Position 1**: Must be `S` (✓ from guess 4).
- **Position 4**: Must be `E` (✓ from guess 2 and confirmed).
- **Position 5**: Must be `R` (✓ from guess 3 and confirmed).
- **Constraints on positions 2 and 3**:
  - Must not be any excluded letters (`C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I`, `L`, `O`, `U`, `P`).
  - `S` is fixed at position 1, so positions 2 and 3 must be new letters.
  - Common letters like `H`, `Y`, `K`, `D` are untested and plausible.
- **Pattern**: `S _ _ E R`.
- **Options**:
  - Common valid words include `SHYER` (tested here), `SHEER` (duplicate E), or `SKIER` (excluded `I`). 
  - Prioritizing untested high-frequency consonants (`H`) and vowels (`Y`) maximizes information gain. If `SHYER` fails, feedback will isolate the missing letter(s) for the final guess.",Guess 5: shyer -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) Y(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,sever,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: R, S, T, L, N, E are very common.
 Also, including at least two vowels is good.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E. 
 - C and R are common consonants.
 - A and E are common vowels.
 - N is also a common consonant.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C is not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A is not in the word.
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 2 and 5 respectively in ""crane"").
- Letters C, A, N are absent.

We have 6 tries total, and this is the second guess.

Now, we need to make a new 5-letter word guess that:
- Doesn't include C, A, N (since they are marked as not in the word)
- Includes R and E (since they are present, but not in the same positions as in ""crane"")
- We must also consider that R and E are in the word but not in the positions we guessed.

In the first guess:
- R was in position 2 (second letter) but is actually in a different position in the secret word.
- E was in position 5 (last letter) but is actually in a different position.

For the second guess, we should avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4 (since 2 is wrong and not 5? Actually, it could be in 5 too, because the feedback only says wrong position, not that it can't be in 5. But note: the feedback for R says ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, position 5 is available because it was not tried for R. However, E was in position 5 and we know E is present but not in position 5? No: wait, the feedback for E says it is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1,2,3,4? And similarly, R can be in positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, positions 1,3,4 are common for both? Let me clarify:

The secret word has letters: R and E (and three others) and excludes C, A, N.

We must avoid:
- Using C, A, N anywhere.
- Placing R in position 2 (since that was wrong).
- Placing E in position 5 (since that was wrong).

We also don't know the other letters. We need to choose a word that includes R and E, and avoids C,A,N.

Common letters: Let's try to pick a word that includes other common letters like T, O, I, L, S, etc.

Since R is present, we can try words that start with R? Or have R in another spot.

Also, note that the secret word doesn't have A, so words with A should be avoided.

Let me think of words that include R and E, and without C,A,N.

Possible candidates:

1. Words starting with R: But we don't know if R is first. But we can try? However, we should avoid having R in position 2? Actually, for our next guess, we can put R anywhere except position 2? Or we could? Actually, we can put R anywhere we have not yet ruled out. The feedback tells us only that position 2 is incorrect for R. So R could be in 1,3,4,5? But note: we also have E that must be placed not in position 5.

But wait: the secret word has E somewhere else? So in our next guess, we don't want to put E in position 5 again? Actually, we are allowed, but it might give redundant information? So we should avoid placing E in position 5 because we already know it's not there? Similarly, we should avoid placing R in position 2.

So for our second guess, let's avoid:
- Putting R in position 2
- Putting E in position 5

Also, the word must not contain C, A, N.

We have to guess a word that includes R and E? Actually, not necessarily? Wait no, we know R and E are in the word? Actually, from the feedback, R and E are present? So yes, they must be in the word? Therefore, every subsequent guess must include R and E? But we don't know how many times? So we assume they appear at least once.

Now, we also don't know any other letters.

We can try a word that uses other common letters? Like T, O, I, L, S.

Possible words:

Consider: ""ROTATE"" -> too long? We need 5 letters. And it has A? Which is ruled out? Also has T? But A is excluded? So no A allowed? So ""ROTATE"" has A? So not allowed.

Other words:

- ""STORE"": 
  - S, T, O, R, E.
  - Does it include R? Yes. E? Yes.
  - Avoids C, A, N? Yes.
  - Position: 
    - R is placed in position 4? And we are avoiding position 2? We are not placing R in position 2? Here R is in 4? That's new.
    - E is placed in position 5? But we must avoid? Because E is in position 5? But feedback on E said E(-) meaning it's present but not in position 5? So putting E in position 5 is not allowed? Actually, we can put it? But we already know that position 5 is wrong? So if we put it there, we expect a ""-"" if E is still in the word? But we know it is? So we might get a ""-"" again? Alternatively, we might get a ""x"" if the secret word had two E's and we haven't tried E in other positions? Actually, no: we know there's at least one E? But we should put E in a different position to try to find its correct spot? Therefore, we should avoid position 5? So let's not put E in position 5.

So avoid:
- Letters: C, A, N
- Position 2: R?
- Position 5: E?

Alternatively, we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4? And then we avoid R in position 2? Position 2 can be any letter? Actually, position 2 can be any letter? But R cannot be there? Only that R was in position 2 last time? So we can put E in position 2? Yes, because last time E was not in position 5? But we haven't tested position 2 for E? So yes, we can put E in position 2? But we know that R was in position 2? But R was taken as absent? Actually, no: R is present? But we put R in position 2? But the feedback said it's in the word but not in position 2? So we think R is not in position 2? And E? We don't know? Maybe E is in position 2? We don't know? It could be? So let's try to put E in a position we haven't tried? Currently, we tried E only in position 5? So positions 1,2,3,4? We can try one? Similarly, R: we tried in position 2? So we can try R in 1,3,4,5? But note: position 5? We also tried E in 5? So R can be in 5? Because E was tried in 5? So we can try.

But we might want to test different letters? We haven't tried? Also, we don't know if there might be other letters? So let's choose a word that uses new common letters? Such as T, O, I, L, S.

Possible words:

- ""tires"": T, I, R, E, S -> no C,A,N? Yes. E is in position 4? Not 5. R is in position 3? Not 2? So good! But wait: positions?
  - T in 1st
  - I in 2nd -> we don't know? We don't have info? But we haven't ruled out? 
  - R in 3rd: not 2nd? Previously R was in 2nd? So now we are trying R in 3rd? Which is new.
  - E in 4th? Previously E was in 5th? Now we are trying E in 4th? Which is new.

Alternative: ""robes""? But it has B? Maybe? Also, E in position 5? We wanted to avoid? 
- robes: R, O, B, E, S -> E in position 5? Avoid? So better avoid position 5 for E? 

So ""tires"" seems good? But let me see: what common letters we cover? 
It includes T, I, R, E, S? That's 5 distinct letters? And we exclude C,A,N? Also, we are testing S? Which is common? 

Another option: ""stern"": 
S, T, E, R, N -> but N is excluded? We can't because N was marked as absent? So ""tires"" doesn't have N? Good? 

Also, ""slope"": S, L, O, P, E? But it doesn't include R? We know R must be in the word? Why? Because R was marked as present? And we haven't found the word? So we must include R? Otherwise, we might not get information? However, if we don't include R, then if the new guess has no R and we get feedback that shows R is there? Actually, the feedback will tell us? But we are trying to guess quickly? And we know R is in? So we must include R? Similarly E?

Therefore, in the second guess, we must include both R and E? Yes? Because we know they are present? And also avoid C,A,N? 

We can try ""tries"": T, R, I, E, S? 
This word has R in position 2? But wait: we must avoid putting R in position 2? Because last time R was in position 2? And the feedback said it's present but not in that position? Therefore, putting R in position 2 again? Then the feedback would say ""-"" again? And we learned nothing new? So that wastes a slot? So we should avoid putting R in position 2? Similarly, avoid E in position 5? 

So ""tries"": Positions? 
1: T? 
2: R? -> but we are putting R in position 2? Which we already know is wrong? We expect a ""-"" again? 
3: I? 
4: E? 
5: S? 

We are avoiding E in position 5? But here E is in position 4? So that's okay? But R is in position 2? Which we shouldn't? Actually, we have to avoid position 2 for R? So we cannot use ""tries"" because we are repeating a known wrong position? We want to rule out new positions? So we avoid?

Therefore, ""tires"": 
1: T? 
2: I? 
3: R? -> not in position 2? So new position? 
4: E? -> not in position 5? So new position? 
5: S? 

So that's good? 

Alternatively, ""resit"": 
1: R? 
2: E? -> but we haven't tested position 2? We know R was wrong in 2? But E? We haven't tested E in 2? So we can? But is it a real word? I think RESIT is valid? 

But let me think: We know R is present? Putting R in position 1? We don't know if that's correct? Similarly? 

But we have two positions: R can be in 1,3,4,5? And E in 1,2,3,4? 

If we put R in 1? Then we might get ✓? Or -? Or x if by mistake? But we know R is in? So ✓ or -? 

Similarly, for E? 

In ""resit"": 
R in 1? 
E in 2? 
S in 3? 
I in 4? 
T in 5? 

We avoid: 
- Letters: C,A,N? Yes? 
- R not in 2? Yes? 
- E not in 5? Yes? 

So we are testing R in position 1 and E in position 2? Both new? 

But which one is better? 
We get to test two new positions? 

Alternatively, ""store"": 
S, T, O, R, E -> 
R in position 4? 
E in position 5? But we avoid E in position 5? So that doesn't help? Therefore, we skip.

So between ""tires"" and ""resit""? Both are valid?

Another candidate: ""arise""? But has A? Ruled out? Not allowed.

""opera""? Has O,P,E,R,A? A? Excluded? So not allowed.

""house"": H,O,U,S,E? Doesn't have R? So we don't include R? Then the feedback for R? We know R is in the word? So if we don't include R? We get a problem? The feedback will tell us that R is still missing? Meaning? For each letter? So if we don't include R? Then the position where we don't have R? But for letters? We get feedback for each letter? Specifically? For ""house"", 
H: new? 
O: new? 
U: new? 
S: new? 
E: and E? We know E? But position? E is in position 5? Which we already tested? And was wrong? So we put E again in 5? So we expect ""-"" for E? Because in wrong position? Because we know E is in the word but position 5 is wrong? So we expect ""-""? 
And R? We didn't include? So the feedback would say:
- For H: could be ✓, - , or x? 
Similarly for O,U,S? 
Then for E: might be ""-"" again? 
But we didn't test R? So what? We know R is present? So we need to include R? Otherwise, we won't get information about R's position? 

Therefore, we must include R? And E? Because they are confirmed? 

So words without R? Are wasted? Similarly without E? 

Therefore, we stick to including both? 

So let me choose: 
I am thinking of ""resit""? Which has R and E? 

But note: the word might have double letters? We don't know? 

But for now? 

Actually, ""tires"" is the same letters as ""tries""? But in different order? Without repeating known wrong positions? 

Summary of candidates:

1. ""tires"": 
   - T, I, R, E, S 
   - R in pos 3 (new) 
   - E in pos 4 (new) 

2. ""resit"": 
   - R in pos 1 (new) 
   - E in pos 2 (new) 

Which one is better? 

I am inclined to ""tires""? Because position 1 has T? Which is a common letter? And position 2 has I? Which is common vowel? But also ""resit"" has R as first? which is less common? Actually, many words start with T? 

Another candidate: ""stern"": but has N? Not allowed? 

""brize""? Not a common word? 

So I'll go with ""tires"". 

It avoids C,A,N and puts R and E in new positions? 

Also, letters T, I, S? Are new? Common? 

So let's guess ""tires"". 

But wait: we haven't tried position 1? Position 2? etc? 

Also, if the secret word has I? Then we might find? 

I think it's a good guess? 

Therefore, second guess: <guess>tires</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked with ""x""), so they must be avoided.
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked with ""-"").
- E is in the word but **not in position 5** (marked with ""-"").

For the next guess:
- The word must include both R and E (as they are confirmed present) but place R anywhere except position 2 and E anywhere except position 5.
- Avoid C, A, and N entirely.
- Introduce new common letters (like T, I, S) to test additional potential positions.

A strong choice is **""tires""** because:
- It contains R (placed in position 3, a new untested position) and E (placed in position 4, avoiding position 5).
- It avoids C, A, and N.
- It introduces new common letters: T in position 1, I in position 2, and S in position 5 (all not tested before).

This strategically maximizes information gain by testing R and E in new positions while covering new high-frequency letters.

<guess>tires</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tires -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C, A, N: absent.
- R: present but not in position 2 (so in position 1, 3, or 4? But note: positions are 1-based? Actually, in the example: BRISK and STORM: S is position 1? So ""crane"": C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5). Feedback: R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. E(-) meaning E is in the word but not in position 5.

Second guess: ""tires"" -> T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
Interpretation:
- T: absent (x) -> so T is not in the word.
- I: absent (x) -> so I is not in the word.
- R: present but not in position 3 (because R was guessed in position 3? ""tires"": T(1), I(2), R(3), E(4), S(5). Feedback: R(-) so R is present but not in position 3.
- E: correct! (✓) in position 4. So E is in the secret word at position 4.
- S: present but not in position 5. So S is in the word but not in position 5.

Now, we have:
- The secret word contains: R (present), E (correct at position 4), S (present).
- Additional letters: we know E is at position 4.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N (from first guess), T, I (from second guess).
- Also note: we have information about positions for R and S.

Specifically:
- R is present but:
  - Not in position 2 (from ""crane"")
  - Not in position 3 (from ""tires"")
  - And since E is at position 4, R cannot be there? R can be in positions 1 or 5? Because remaining positions are 1, 5? Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. E is fixed at 4? So R must be in one of 1,5? Actually, also? What about position 2 and 3 we know R is not? And position 4 is E? So R must be either in position 1 or position 5? Unless there are multiple letters? But we haven't had any indication? But we don't know? There might be two R's? But let's assume no duplicates? Typically? We might need to consider? But for now? 

Similarly, S:
- From ""crane"": we tried S? Actually, we didn't? ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E? No S? So first time we see S? Then ""tires"" had S at position 5? Feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not at position 5? So S must be in positions 1,2,3? But note: position 4 is taken by E? So available positions: 1,2,3? And R is also to be placed in either 1 or 5? But S? So they might share? Actually, S could be in 1,2, or 3? And R in 1 or 5? So conflict? Only at position 1? That is, if R is in 1, then S cannot be in 1? So S must be in 2 or 3? And if R is in 5, then S in 1,2,3 anywhere? 

Currently, we don't know the fifth letter? We have: 
- Position 4: E (locked)
- R must be in 1 or 5?
- S in 2,3? Or if R in 5 then S in 1,2,3? But we also have two other letters? We know the secret word has 5 distinct? Actually, we don't know? Some words have repeated letters? But let's avoid assuming? 

Known letters: 
- R: present (in 1 or 5)
- S: present (in wherever) and not in 5? 
- E: at 4.
- And we know the word has two more letters? Because we haven't found all? 

Excluded? Total excluded: C, A, N, T, I.

Also, we must avoid using these?

We need to guess a word that:
1. Must include R and S (they are present).
2. Must have E at position 4.
3. Avoids C,A,N,T,I.
4. Must have two more letters? And we don't know? 

Furthermore, we have constraints on R and S positions:
- R: must not be in position 2 or 3? And since position 4 is E? So only options: position 1 or 5? 
- S: must not be in position 5? And we haven't tried positions 1,2,3? So S must be in 1,2, or 3? But if R is in position 1, then S must be in 2 or 3? If R in 5, S can be in 1,2,3? 

We also would like to test other positions?

We don't know the fifth (third) letter? And another letter? We know the secret word has 5 letters? We have E fixed? And R? And S? And two more? So two unknowns?

We need to guess a word that fits these constraints? 

Let's look for words with pattern: 
- Position 4: E
- Position 1: either R or something else? But if R is in 1? Then word starts with R? Or if not? 

Possible words:

Consider R at position 1? Then S in 2 or 3? 

Options:
R at 1, E at 4: 
- Words like: R? ? E? E? 
But we have S? 

For example: 
ROSE? But O? And S? Position 5 must be something? 
R O S E? Wait: positions: 
1: R? 
2: O? 
3: S? 
4: E? 
5: ? But we have S at position 3? Then the fifth letter? Also, let's see: does it avoid C,A,N,T,I? Yes? Then what? 
But we haven't fixed the fifth letter? 

Other words: R with E at fourth? 

But alternatively, R at position 5? Then the word ends with R? And position 4 is E? So ...E R? 

Now, we want to test positions? Also, we haven't tested letters? 

Common letters remaining? Excluding C,A,N,T,I? Remaining letters: 
B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common letters? For example: O, L, U, P, etc. 

Let's try to form words:

Case 1: R in position 1? Then S in position 2 or 3? 
- If S in position 2: R S ? E ? 
- Possibilities: R S _ E _ ? 
  Words: R S (letter) E (letter) -> RS?E?
  Possible: ROSE (but O is in? But O? Then E? Then? Wait: R O S E -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E -> but in this, S is at position 3? Then fifth letter? ROSE? Not 5 letters? Wait, ROSE is 4? But 5-letter words: ROSED? Not valid? 
  Actually: ROBES? But we avoid B? Maybe? Or wait, we haven't ruled out? 

But let's search:
Possible words: 
- ""ROLES"": 
  1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S? -> but we know S? And we have S at position 5? But S cannot be in position 5? Because from ""tires"", S was at 5 and feedback said - meaning wrong position? So position 5 is invalid for S? Therefore, if R at 1? We cannot have S at 5? 

Also, ""tires"" feedback: S(-) meaning S is not at 5? So in any guess? We avoid S in position 5? 

Therefore, for R in 1? We must put S in 2 or 3? 

If R in 1, S in 2: pattern R S ? E ? 
Possible words? 
RS?E? 
Examples: 
- R S ? E ? 
""rs"" are rare? Maybe ""ruse""? But we know E at 4? So R U S E ...? Wait: position 4 is E? And E must be at 4? So R S ? E ? 
So positions: 1:R,2:S,3:?,4:E,5:? 
Then the word? Must be 5 letters? Valid: RSLEE? Not valid? ""rise""? Wait: ""rise"" is 4 letters? 
We need 5-letter words? 
For 1:R,2:S,3:?,4:E,5:? 
Valid words? 
- ""RUSES"": But S appears twice? And at position 5? Also S? But already excluded? 
Or ""RASED"": But A? Excluded? 
""RUSLE"": Not valid? 
Perhaps no common words? 

Alternatively: R at 1, S at position 3: pattern R ? S E ? 
Examples: 
1:R,2:?,3:S,4:E,5:? 
Valid words: 
- ""ROUSE"": R O U S E -> yes? 
Letters: O,U -> not excluded? 
Also, ""REUSE"": R E U S E -> but E repeated? And E is at position 2? Duplicated E? Then for position 2: E? But the secret word? We know E is at position 4? But there might be two E? 
Actually, the feedback might show? 
But let's see if it's possible? 

Similarly, ""raise"": has A? Excluded? 
""rouse"": R O U S E -> 
1:R,2:O,3:U,4:S? Wait, S? But we need E at 4? And S at position? 
- Actually: ""rouse"": R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> no E at 4? That doesn't work? 
We need E at 4? So ""rouse""? Cannot? 

How about ""RESET""? But R at 1? Position 4: E? So R E S E T? 
1:R, 2:E, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T? 
But T is excluded? 
Not valid? 

Another word: ""RIPES""? I excluded? 

So perhaps none without excluded letters? 

Alternative: R at position 5? Pattern: ? ? ? E R? 
Then S? Can be at 1,2,3? 

Pattern: _ _ _ E R? 
And S must be in 1,2,3? 

Now, words: ... E R? 

Examples: 
- ""__SER"" -> then S at position 3? 
  For example: ""POSER"", ""LOSER"", ""HOSER"", ""ROGER"" is R O G E R -> repeated R? Duplicated R? But we don't know if possible? 
But R? We must include R? And if R is at 5? Then there is only one R? 
So words must have S somewhere? And E at 4? R at 5? 

Pattern: _ _ S E R? 
Then first two letters: two more letters? For example: ""PASER"" -> has A? Excluded? 
""USER"" -> but 4 letters? 
5-letter: ""HOSER"": H O S E R -> 
Positions: 
1: H? 
2: O? 
3: S? 
4: E? 
5: R? 
This works? 
Avoids C,A,N,T,I? Yes? 
And R is at position 5? Which is allowed? 
S is at position 3? Which is not 5? So okay? 
But we haven't tried O and H before? 

Alternatively: S at position 1: pattern S _ _ E R? 
Words: ""S_ _ER"" 
Examples: ""SOWER"", ""SUPER"", ""SABER"" (has A? excluded), ""SHEER"" (double E? and E at 4 but also other E?), ""SHOER""? Not common? 

S at position 2: pattern _ S ? E R? 
For example: ""ASPER"" (has A? excluded), ""ISLER""? Not common? 

So ""HOSER"" seems good? 

But let me see: common letters? 

Another pattern: without S? But we must include S? Wait? 

We know:
- R must be in 1 or 5?
- E at 4?
- S must be in 1,2,3? Except if R in 1? Then S cannot in 1? 

But also, we don't know the other letters? 

We can also consider: maybe S is the other possible position? 

But let me try: we need to guess? And there is also the possibility that R is in position 1? And we haven't found? 

Maybe we can try a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to commit? 

Another idea: we know the word has S? But not found? 

We can try ""loser"": L O S E R -> 
Positions: 
1: L? 
2: O? 
3: S? 
4: E? 
5: R? 
Pattern: S at position 3? And R at 5? 
Avoids all forbidden letters? 

But is it valid? Yes? 
Also, ""loser"" avoids C,A,N,T,I? 

Similarly, we can use ""homer"": H O M E R? 
But E at 4? R at 5? 
S? Where? Doesn't include S? Then feedback? We know S must be in the word? Why? Because we had ""tires"" guess? S(-)? So S must be in the word? So if we don't include S? Then feedback? We would get S missing? But we know S is present? So we must include S? 

Therefore, ""loser"" has S? At position 3? 

""loser"": L,O,S,E,R -> yes? 
So: 
- Position 3: S? Which we haven't tried? 
- Position 5: R? Which we tried? But we know R is present? And we are testing a new position? Because R was not tried in 5? 

Previously? We tried R only in positions 2 and 3? And wrong? And E is known at 4? 
So R in 5 is untested? 

Also, S? Tried in position 5? Found wrong? But now S in 3? Untested? And we expect S to be there? Maybe? 

Common word? Yes? 

Alternatively? Another word: ""muser"": M U S E R? 
Also? 

But ""loser"" is more common? 

Another: ""poser"": P O S E R? 

All valid? 

Now? Which one to choose? 

We can choose ""loser""? It includes L and O? New letters? 

Also? Notice: in ""tires"", we have E at 4? That was correct? So we can rely? 

Therefore, guess ""loser""? 

But we have R at 5? And S at 3? 

Also? If it's not? We get feedback? 

Another candidate: if R is in position 1? Then we need S in 2 or 3? And E at 4? 

For example: word ""robed""? But we avoid? Or ""rubel""? Not common? 

""RISEN""? Has I? Excluded? 

""RESOD""? R E S O D? Then: 1:R,2:E,3:S,4:O,5:D? But E at 4? But we have E at 4? Fixed? So position 2:E? Then? 
Wait? Our pattern? If R at 1? Then we can have E at 4? But position 2? We haven't tested for E? Actually, we know E is at 4? So position 2 should not be E? Because E is only at 4? We don't know? In secret word? E is only at 4? Or could be elsewhere? Actually, the feedback? For ""crane"": E(-) meaning E is present but not at 5? Then for ""tires"": E(✓) at 4? That's correct? So E is fixed at 4? And there are no other E? So we must not put E elsewhere? 

Therefore, any word must have E only at position 4? 

Therefore, for R at position 1? We cannot have E at 2? 

Similarly? 

So pattern for R at 1: 
1:R, 2:?, 3: (S or ?) ,4:E, 5:? 
And S must be in 2 or 3? If in 3: R ? S E ? 
Valid? 
1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:P? ""rosep""? Not valid? 
1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:M? ""rosem""? No? 
1:R, 2:U, 3:S, 4:E, 5:D? ""rused""? Not common? 
But ""ruse""? Is 4 letters? 
How about ""RUSES""? But S twice? And E at 4? So R U S E S? Then positions: 
1:R,2:U,3:S,4:E,5:S -> but S at 3 and 5? But from ""tires"", we have S? And we know S? So if we use duplicate? Then feedback? 

But for now? We assume no duplicate? Because we haven't seen? 

Actually? We don't know? 

But common words? 

Therefore? The better bet seems R in 5? And we choose ""loser""? 

Additionally? We could try ""poser""? P O S E R? 

But why? 

Also? Note? We haven't used P,O,L? 

Now? Both ""loser"" and ""poser"" are valid? 

But let's choose? 

Actually? There is another constraint: the word must not contain any excluded letters? 

So? 

I think ""loser"" is good? 

Therefore? Third guess: loser

But wait? The word ""loser""? It includes L, O, S, E, R? 
S is at position 3? And we haven't tested S? And R at 5? 

Expected feedback? 

If the secret word? For example? 

Perhaps? 

Alternatively? We can choose a word that rules out the other possibility? But it's fine? 

Let me try? 

So guess? ""loser""? 

But wait? Another word: ""SUPER""? But it starts with S? Pattern S _ _ E R? 
If S at 1? Then word: S U P E R? 
Positions: 
1:S? 
2: ? 
3:? 
4:E? 
5:R? 
Now? In this? S at first? Which hasn't been tested? 
R at last? 
But U and P? 

Also? Avoids excluded letters? 

But we know? From ""tires"", I was excluded? 

Now? ""SUPER""? S,U,P,E,R? 

But P? Not tested? 

But? Also? R at 5? 

Compared to ""loser""? L,O,S,E,R? 

Both seem fine? 

Perhaps ""super"" is shorter? 

But? Actually? Let me see? 

But? We also need to consider: in ""loser""? Position 3:S? And position 5:R? 

In ""super""? Position 1:S? Then? 

We could? But? 

But? By guessing ""loser""? Or ""super""? 

But? We have? 

I think we can go with ""loser"". 

Therefore: 

<guess>loser</guess> 

But? Let's double-check? 

Summary: 
- Positions: We know position 4 must be E? 
- R: must be in 1 or 5? 
- S: must be in 1,2,3? 
- Avoid C,A,N,T,I? 

In ""loser"": 
- Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:R 
- We are testing R in position 5? (and also S in position 3) 

If the secret word has R in 5? Then we might get R✓? Or if not? Then wrong? 

We'll see? 

Alternatively? If R is not in 5? Then we learn that R must be in 1? 

But? For this guess? 

Yes? 

So? 

I choose ""loser"". 

But? We still have to write? 

Note: We must include all? 

Actually? Let me list the known? 

Perhaps? There are other constraints? 

In the second guess ""tires""? We learned E(✓) at 4? 

Also? R(-) at 3? 

Now? 

We are guessing? 

I think? 

Therefore? 

Final guess: loser### Reasoning for the Next Guess

We have two previous guesses with feedback:

1. **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  
   - `C`, `A`, `N` are absent from the secret word.  
   - `R` is present but not in position 2.  
   - `E` is present but not in position 5.  

2. **Guess 2: tires → Feedback: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)**  
   - `T` and `I` are absent.  
   - `R` is present but not in position 3.  
   - `E` is correct and fixed in position 4!  
   - `S` is present but not in position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters:**  
  - `E` is locked at position 4.  
  - `R` and `S` are present in the word.
- **Absent letters:** `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I` must be avoided.  
- **Position constraints for `R`:**  
  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or 3 (from ""tires"").  
  - Since position 4 is occupied by `E`, `R` must be in position 1 or 5 (*no duplicates inferred yet*).  
- **Position constraints for `S`:**  
  - Cannot be in position 5 (from ""tires"").  
  - Must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
- **Unknowns:** Two letters remain unknown (besides `E`, `R`, `S`), with no duplicates implied.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Include `R` and `S`:** Both are confirmed present.  
- **Position `R` correctly:** Prioritize testing `R` in position 1 or 5 to resolve its location.  
- **Position `S` strategically:** Place `S` in an untested position (1, 2, or 3), avoiding position 5.  
- **Introduce new, common letters:** Test high-frequency consonants/vowels not yet evaluated (e.g., `L`, `O`, `M`) to gather more information.  
- **Avoid guessing `R` in position 5 if `S` is in position 1:** Both letters share possible positions, but feedback will clarify conflicts.  

Ideal word suggestions:
- **`loser`**:  
  - `L` (position 1), `O` (position 2), `S` (position 3), `E` (position 4), `R` (position 5).  
  - Tests `R` in position 5 and `S` in position 3 (both new positions).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters (`C`/`A`/`N`/`T`/`I`).  
  - Introduces `L` and `O` for additional coverage.  
- **Alternative: `poser` or `super`**  
  - Similar pattern but less common letters; `loser` is prioritized as it follows the constraints elegantly.

### Why `loser`?
- If correct: Wins the game (but unlikely this early).  
- If partial: Feedback on `R` (position 5) will confirm if `R` belongs at the end or start (position 1).  
- Feedback on `S` (position 3) and new letters (`L`, `O`) will simplify next guesses.

<guess>loser</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tires -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
Guess 3: loser -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from three guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Second guess: ""tires"" -> T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
Third guess: ""loser"" -> L(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓) R(✓)

Interpretation:

From guess 1:
- C, A, N: absent.
- R: present but not in position 2.
- E: present but not in position 5.

From guess 2:
- T, I: absent.
- R: present but not in position 3.
- E: correct at position 4 (so secret word has E at position 4).
- S: present but not in position 5.

From guess 3:
- L, O: absent.
- S: present but not in position 3 (since guessed at position 3, feedback S(-)).
- E: correct at position 4 (confirmed).
- R: correct at position 5 (so secret word has R at position 5).

Now, we know:
- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5. So the pattern: _ _ _ E R
- S is present in the word, but not in position 3 (from ""loser"") and not in position 5 (from ""tires""). So S must be in position 1 or 2? Because positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So for S? Only positions 1,2,3 are left? But we tried S at positions 5 (in ""tires"") and 3 (in ""loser""), both wrong. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2.

Additionally, we have excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, L, O.

We need to find the first three letters? Actually, the word is: ? ? ? E R, where position 4 is E, position 5 is R. And position 3 is not S? So position 3 must be another letter? And we don't know what? Also, S must be in position 1 or 2? 

Let me list:
- Positions: 
  1: unknown? Could be S?
  2: unknown? Could be S?
  3: unknown? Must not be S? But we don't know?
  4: E (fixed)
  5: R (fixed)

We know S is one of the letters and must be in the word? But we haven't found its correct position? It must be either in position 1, 2, or 3? But wait? We tried position 3? And it was wrong? So S is not in position 3? Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2? 

So possible patterns:
- S ? ? E R   (S at 1)
- ? S ? E R   (S at 2)

And the third position must be filled by another letter? 

We also know the word has exactly one E? And one R? But S? Could be duplicated? But we don't know? 

Moreover, what other letters are possible? We need to avoid excluded letters: C,A,N,T,I,L,O.

So remaining letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? 

We need to find the first three letters: either S at 1 and then two letters? Or S at 2 and then the first letter? 

We have to guess? We can form words that fit? 

Additionally, we want to test? We know S must be in 1 or 2? So we can aim to test S in one of these positions? 

Let me consider:

Case 1: S at position 1? Pattern: S ? ? E R? 
Then the middle two letters? 

Case 2: S not at 1? Then S must be at position 2? Pattern: ? S ? E R?

We still have an unknown letter at position 3? 

To maximize information? We might choose a word that is possible? 

We can try to fix S in position 1? And see?

Possible words? For pattern S ? ? E R? 
With S at 1? 
Valid words: 
- ""SAYER"": but A excluded? 
- ""SABER"": A? excluded?
- ""SUPER"": S U P E R? 
  1:S, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R -> but avoids excluded? And letters U and P? 
Not excluded? 
Valid word? 

Similarly: ""SOWER"": S O W E R -> O excluded? 
""SHER"": not 5 letters? 
""SEWER"": S E W E R -> but E repeated? At position 2? We know E is only at 4? So should not be at 2? Therefore, duplicated E? 

But we don't know? Perhaps? 

But ""SUPER"": S U P E R? 
Positions: 
1:S, 2:U, 3:P, 4:E, 5:R -> 
As above? 

But let me see? 

Now? Similarly? For pattern ? S ? E R? With S at 2? 
Example: ""USHER"": U S H E R -> 
1:U, 2:S, 3:H, 4:E, 5:R -> 
Valid? 

Also? 

But we don't know? 

Now? How to resolve? 

We can guess ""super""? Which has S at position 1? And if wrong? Then S must be at position 2? 

Similarly? 

But also? We can choose a word that respects both? 

However? We have only 3 guesses left? (since fourth guess)? 

Therefore? We can guess?

I think ""super"" is a good candidate? Because? 
- It places S at position 1? Which we haven't tested? 
- If S is in position 1? Then it might be ✓? 
- Or if not? Then S must be at position 2? 
- Also? It introduces U and P? 

Similarly? 

But let me see? We know? 

Actually? We can also try a word without S? But we must include S? Because? Actually? We don't have to? But if we exclude S? We might get feedback that S is missing? But we know S is present? So we must include S? 

Therefore? 

So? Guess ""super""? 

But? If S is at position 2? Then ""super"" would have S at 1? Wrong? Then we will get S(-)? Meaning S is present? But at wrong position? Then we know S must be at position 2? 

Similarly? 

Then? 

Also? We might find? 

Another candidate: ""usher""? Which has S at position 2? 

Why one over the other? 

We don't know? 

Also? Notice: in ""super"", we have P? And U? New letters? 

Similarly? 

We can choose? 

But? Perhaps we want to test the other possibility? 

Actually? Since we don't know? We might guess one? And then based on feedback? 

I think? That's the best? 

Let me choose ""super""? 

Therefore? Fourth guess: ""super""? 

But? Alternatively? 

We have? 

After? 

Yes? 

So? 

Therefore? 

<guess>super</guess> 

But let me confirm the format? 

Final decision: ""super""### Reasoning Based on Feedback

**Feedback Analysis:**
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: `C` (absent), `R` (present but wrong position), `A` (absent), `N` (absent), `E` (present but wrong position).  
  → **Key Insights**: `R` and `E` are in the word. Avoid `C`, `A`, `N`.  
- **Guess 2 (tires)**: `T` (absent), `I` (absent), `R` (present but wrong position), `E` (correct in position 4), `S` (present but wrong position).  
  → **Key Insights**: `R` is not in position 3. `E` is fixed at position 4. `S` is present but not in position 5. Avoid `T`, `I`.  
- **Guess 3 (loser)**: `L` (absent), `O` (absent), `S` (present but wrong position), `E` (correct), `R` (correct).  
  → **Key Insights**: `S` is not in position 3. `E` (position 4) and `R` (position 5) are fixed. Avoid `L`, `O`.  

**Constraints Summary:**
- **Fixed positions**: Position 4 = `E`, Position 5 = `R`.  
- **Confirmed present**: `S` must be in position 1 or 2 (as it cannot be in 3, 4, or 5).  
- **Absent letters**: `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I`, `L`, `O` must be excluded.  
- **Unknowns**: Letters for positions 1 and 2 (one of which is `S`), and position 3.  

**Strategy for Next Guess (Try 4/6):**
- Target resolving `S`'s position: Test it in **position 1** since position 2 is also possible.  
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., `U`, `P`) to gain more information.  
- Prioritize words matching the pattern `_ _ _ E R` with `S` in position 1 and avoiding excluded letters.  

**Ideal Word: `SUPER`**  
- Structure: `S` (position 1), `U` (position 2), `P` (position 3), `E` (position 4), `R` (position 5).  
- **Why?**  
  - Tests `S` in position 1 (untested; if wrong, `S` must be in position 2).  
  - Covers `U` and `P` (common unused letters; high frequency).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters and aligns with position constraints.  
  - Maximizes info: Feedback on `S` and new letters (`U`, `P`) will pinpoint word structure.  

If `SUPER` is incorrect, feedback on `S` will confirm if it belongs in position 2. Position 3 (`P`) and new letters will help narrow the next guess.

<guess>super</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tires -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
Guess 3: loser -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 4: super -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(x) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from four guesses:

First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Second guess: ""tires"" -> T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
Third guess: ""loser"" -> L(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓) R(✓)
Fourth guess: ""super"" -> S(✓) U(x) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)

Interpretation:

From the fourth guess ""super"":
- S is correct at position 1: so secret word starts with S.
- U is absent (x): so U is not in the word.
- P is absent (x): so P is not in the word.
- E is correct at position 4 (already known).
- R is correct at position 5 (already known).

So now we know:
- Secret word: S ? ? E R
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)
- We need to find positions 2 and 3.

Also, we know:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, L, O, U, P (from all feedback)
- Earlier, from ""crane"": R was present but not at 2? Actually, now we know R is at 5? So that constraint is solved.
- From ""tires"": S was present but not at 5? Now we know S is at 1? So constraint resolved.

For the middle positions (2 and 3), we have two letters to find? And they must not be any of the excluded letters.

We tried:
- In ""tires"": position 2 was I? But I is excluded? So not? 
- In ""loser"": position 2 was O? Excluded? Position 3 was S? But now S is at 1? So not?
- In ""super"": position 2 was U? Excluded? Position 3 was P? Excluded?

Therefore, positions 2 and 3 are two letters that are not in the excluded list and form a valid English word of the pattern S _ _ E R.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, L, O, U, P.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z? But we need common ones?

Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, ... etc.

We need to form words S ? ? E R.

Possible words: 
- ""SAYER"": but A? Excluded? No?
- ""SABER"": A? Excluded?
- ""SEWER"": S E W E R -> has E at position 2? But we know E is only at position 4? So duplicated E? Might be? But in feedback? For ""crane"", E was present? And at ""tires"", E was only at 4? Third guess ""loser"" didn't test E anywhere else? So could there be two E? Possibly? But let's see: ""SEWER"" would have E at position 2? Then if we guess? 

But ""SEWER"" is a word? Meaning: a person who uses a needle? Or something? It's 5 letters.

But E at position 2? Then E at position 4? So two E? Then the feedback for ""crane"" had E(-) meaning at least one E? But position 5? But we had E at 5? Then for ""tires"", E at 4? Then? Actually, we don't know? 

But if we consider? Now?

However? In ""SEWER"": 
Positions: 
1: S? 
2: E? 
3: W? 
4: E? 
5: R? 

Now? We are going to test? 

But we have a constraint? We know from ""super""? U and P? Excluded? 

But E? Not excluded? 

Therefore, possible? 

But we excluded A? But ""SEWER"" has no A? 

Also? 

Other words? 

""SEDER"": S E D E R? Similarly? 

But we are looking? 

Also? 

However? There are other words? Without duplicated E?

For example:
- ""SHYER"": but Y? 
- ""SHOER"": S H O E R -> but O? Excluded? 
- ""SKIER"": K? But I? Excluded? 
- ""SMEAR"": S M E A R -> A? Excluded? 
- ""SHEER"": S H E E R -> duplicated E? 
- ""SHEAR"": A? Excluded? 
- ""SHVER"": not word? 

What about?
- ""shoer"": but O excluded? 
- ""sizer"": Z? But I? Excluded? 
- ""saker"": K? 

But let me search? 

Another: ""SEVER"": S E V E R -> again duplicated E? 

Or ""SEAMER"": too long? 

Not? 

Perhaps? 

We need to pick a word that uses available letters? 

Since we don't know? We can choose one? 

But note: we have only a few letters left? 

Perhaps ""sheer""? 

But duplicated E? 

But I think? The secret word might be? 

Wait? 

Another idea: positions 2 and 3? We tested? 

In previous guesses? We haven't tested position 2? Actually? We tested I, O, U? All absent? So position 2 must be one of the remaining? 

Similarly? Position 3? We tested S? Then in ""loser""? We tested S? But wrong? Then in ""super""? We tested P? Wrong? So we tried? 

But? 

What letters? 

We can try? Let's pick? 

Given pattern? S ? ? E R? 

We can list possible words? 

Common? 
- ""SHEER"": S H E E R -> two E? Letters H and E? 
- ""SHAKER"": too long? 
- ""SHIER"": S H I E R -> I excluded? 
- ""SHOER"": O excluded? 
- ""SEWER"": S E W E R -> 
- ""SOWER"": O excluded? 
- ""SEVER"": S E V E R -> 
- ""SEDGE"": wrong pattern? S E D G E? Ends with E? Not R? 

What about? 
- ""seder"": S E D E R? (Jewish ritual feast? Or word?) 

But might be accepted? 

Similarly? 

But we avoid E at position 2? Or not? 

We don't know? 

Therefore? We might choose a word without E? But? 

But we know? 

Actually? In position 2? We haven't tested many? So we should choose? 

Perhaps? 

But also? We need to avoid E? Because we know E is at 4? But maybe duplicated E? 

We don't know? 

For efficiency? Since we only have two positions? We can try a word that tests common remaining letters? 

For example? 

Positions 2 and 3: need to be filled? 

We have excluded: A,C,I,L,N,O,P,T,U? 

Common remaining: H, M, D, F, G, K, etc? 

Now? We can form? 

If we try a word like ""SHMER""? Not valid? 

Or ""SHKER""? Same? 

Common words? 

Actually? There is ""shier""? But I? Excluded? 

""smear""? But A? Excluded? 

""sheer""? Might be our best candidate? 

Similarly? ""sheep""? But ends with P? We need R? 

No? 

Therefore? We must use? 

How about ""SMERK""? Not valid? 

Perhaps ""sweer""? Not common? 

I think? The only common options are words with duplicated E? 

Therefore? We guess ""sheer""? 

But? 

Note: from ""crane"" we had E? Which was not at 5? Now we have E at 4? But we don't know about position 2? 

But if E is at 2? Then in ""sheer"": 

1: S? 
2: E? 
3: E? 
4: E? 
5: R? 

That's not? ""SHEER"" is S H E E R? So positions: 
1: S? 
2: H? 
3: E? 
4: E? 
5: R? 

But we have E at 4? So position 4 is E? Correct? Then position 3? E? Then two E? 

In feedback? For ""crane"": E(-) meaning E is present? But that could be? 

But we also have to fit the pattern? 

Therefore? 

But in ""sheer""? We have E at 3 and 4? 

Now? But our known pattern: S ? ? E R? Position 4 is E? Position 5 is R? So position 3 cannot be E? Wait? Actually? Position 4 is E? But we don't know? 

But position 3? We haven't fixed? 

By guessing ""sheer""? We can see? 

Therefore? 

But let me see? 

Perhaps? 

Alternative? 

Another word: ""shyer"": S H Y E R? 
Positions: 
1:S, 2:H, 3:Y, 4:E, 5:R? 
Valid word? 
Avoids excluded? 

So? 

Letters: H, Y? 

Then? 

And Y is not excluded? 

Similarly? 

Is ""shyer"" valid? Yes? 

Meaning: a horse that shies easily? Or something? 

So? 

Therefore? 

We can guess ""shyer""? 

And H and Y? New letters? 

Similarly? 

We can choose? 

Another: ""skier"": but I? Excluded? 
""sheer"": has duplicated E? But we don't know? 
""shyer"": has Y? 

Also? 

We can try ""sizer"": but I? Excluded? 

Therefore? 

Let me choose ""shyer""? 

But? Perhaps? 

I notice: we haven't tested H and Y? 

But also? 

Similarly? 

So? 

Therefore? Fourth guess? Was ""super""? Now fifth? Guess ""shyer""? 

Fifth guess? 

But? Let's write: 

So? Guess: ""shyer""? 

But? Format? 

So? 

Conclusion? 

I think? 

Alternatively? We can guess? 

But? 

Given? We have S and E and R? But? 

Perhaps? 

But? 

So? 

<guess>shyer</guess> 

But let me confirm? 

Pattern: S H Y E R? 

Avoids excluded? 

Yes? 

Therefore? 

Fifth guess: shyer### Reasoning for Guess 5

**Feedback Recap (Crucial Constraints):**
- **Position 1**: `S` (fixed, per guess 4).  
- **Position 4**: `E` (fixed, per guess 2).  
- **Position 5**: `R` (fixed, per guess 3).  
- **Absent Letters**: `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I`, `L`, `O`, `U`, `P` (cleared via feedback).  

**Unknowns:**  
- Positions **2** and **3** need letters that:  
  (a) Are valid English letters not in the excluded list.  
  (b) Form a real 5-letter word `S _ _ E R`.  
  (c) Must include potential letters like `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `K`, `M`, `Y`, etc.  

**Strategic Approach:**  
- Since positions 2 and 3 are untested for most letters (only `I`, `O`, `U`, `P` tested and excluded), use a word with common high-frequency consonants/vowels.  
- Prioritize testing `H` (high frequency) and `Y` (less common but possible) to cover ground quickly.  
- Avoid using `E` in positions 2 or 3 (though duplicates like `S E E E R` are possible but unlikely given feedback hasn’t hinted at it).  

**Best Candidate: `SHYER`**  
- Word Breakdown: `S` (1) + `H` (2) + `Y` (3) + `E` (4) + `R` (5).  
- **Why?**  
  - Tests `H` in position 2 and `Y` in position 3 – both new, unexcluded letters.  
  - Fits pattern `S _ _ E R` perfectly while avoiding all excluded letters.  
  - Common enough to be valid (e.g., ""one who shies"").  
  - If incorrect, feedback will dramatically narrow options for the final guess.  

**Alternatives Considered:**  
- `SHEER` (S + H + E + E + R): Less ideal as it forces a duplicate `E` in position 3, which hasn’t been hinted at.  
- `SEWER` (S + E + W + E + R): Duplicate `E` in position 2 and unexcluded `W`; likely word but redundant `E` test.  
- Other words like `SHMER`/`SKYER` are invalid.  

Given only 2 unknowns and limited guesses left, `SHYER` optimally balances common letters and pattern alignment.

<guess>shyer</guess>### Thought Process
Based on the accumulated feedback:
- **Position 1**: Must be `S` (✓ from guess 4).
- **Position 4**: Must be `E` (✓ from guess 2 and confirmed).
- **Position 5**: Must be `R` (✓ from guess 3 and confirmed).
- **Constraints on positions 2 and 3**:
  - Must not be any excluded letters (`C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I`, `L`, `O`, `U`, `P`).
  - `S` is fixed at position 1, so positions 2 and 3 must be new letters.
  - Common letters like `H`, `Y`, `K`, `D` are untested and plausible.
- **Pattern**: `S _ _ E R`.
- **Options**:
  - Common valid words include `SHYER` (tested here), `SHEER` (duplicate E), or `SKIER` (excluded `I`). 
  - Prioritizing untested high-frequency consonants (`H`) and vowels (`Y`) maximizes information gain. If `SHYER` fails, feedback will isolate the missing letter(s) for the final guess.

Actually, it could be in 5 too, because the feedback only says wrong position, not that it can\'t be in 5. But note: the feedback for R says ""-"" meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. It could be in 1, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, position 5 is available because it was not tried for R. However, E was in position 5 and we know E is present but not in position 5? No: wait, the feedback for E says it is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1,2,3,4? And similarly, R can be in positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, positions 1,3,4 are common for both? Let me clarify:\n\nThe secret word has letters: R and E (and three others) and excludes C, A, N.\n\nWe must avoid:\n- Using C, A, N anywhere.\n- Placing R in position 2 (since that was wrong).\n- Placing E in position 5 (since that was wrong).\n\nWe also don\'t know the other letters. We need to choose a word that includes R and E, and avoids C,A,N.\n\nCommon letters: Let\'s try to pick a word that includes other common letters like T, O, I, L, S, etc.\n\nSince R is present, we can try words that start with R? Or have R in another spot.\n\nAlso, note that the secret word doesn\'t have A, so words with A should be avoided.\n\nLet me think of words that include R and E, and without C,A,N.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n1. Words starting with R: But we don\'t know if R is first. But we can try? However, we should avoid having R in position 2? Actually, for our next guess, we can put R anywhere except position 2? Or we could? Actually, we can put R anywhere we have not yet ruled out. The feedback tells us only that position 2 is incorrect for R. So R could be in 1,3,4,5? But note: we also have E that must be placed not in position 5.\n\nBut wait: the secret word has E somewhere else? So in our next guess, we don\'t want to put E in position 5 again? Actually, we are allowed, but it might give redundant information? So we should avoid placing E in position 5 because we already know it\'s not there? Similarly, we should avoid placing R in position 2.\n\nSo for our second guess, let\'s avoid:\n- Putting R in position 2\n- Putting E in position 5\n\nAlso, the word must not contain C, A, N.\n\nWe have to guess a word that includes R and E? Actually, not necessarily? Wait no, we know R and E are in the word? Actually, from the feedback, R and E are present? So yes, they must be in the word? Therefore, every subsequent guess must include R and E? But we don\'t know how many times? So we assume they appear at least once.\n\nNow, we also don\'t know any other letters.\n\nWe can try a word that uses other common letters? Like T, O, I, L, S.\n\nPossible words:\n\nConsider: ""ROTATE"" -> too long? We need 5 letters. And it has A? Which is ruled out? Also has T? But A is excluded? So no A allowed? So ""ROTATE"" has A? So not allowed.\n\nOther words:\n\n- ""STORE"": \n  - S, T, O, R, E.\n  - Does it include R? Yes. E? Yes.\n  - Avoids C, A, N? Yes.\n  - Position: \n    - R is placed in position 4? And we are avoiding position 2? We are not placing R in position 2? Here R is in 4? That\'s new.\n    - E is placed in position 5? But we must avoid? Because E is in position 5? But feedback on E said E(-) meaning it\'s present but not in position 5? So putting E in position 5 is not allowed? Actually, we can put it? But we already know that position 5 is wrong? So if we put it there, we expect a ""-"" if E is still in the word? But we know it is? So we might get a ""-"" again? Alternatively, we might get a ""x"" if the secret word had two E\'s and we haven\'t tried E in other positions? Actually, no: we know there\'s at least one E? But we should put E in a different position to try to find its correct spot? Therefore, we should avoid position 5? So let\'s not put E in position 5.\n\nSo avoid:\n- Letters: C, A, N\n- Position 2: R?\n- Position 5: E?\n\nAlternatively, we can put E in positions 1,2,3,4? And then we avoid R in position 2? Position 2 can be any letter? Actually, position 2 can be any letter? But R cannot be there? Only that R was in position 2 last time? So we can put E in position 2? Yes, because last time E was not in position 5? But we haven\'t tested position 2 for E? So yes, we can put E in position 2? But we know that R was in position 2? But R was taken as absent? Actually, no: R is present? But we put R in position 2? But the feedback said it\'s in the word but not in position 2? So we think R is not in position 2? And E? We don\'t know? Maybe E is in position 2? We don\'t know? It could be? So let\'s try to put E in a position we haven\'t tried? Currently, we tried E only in position 5? So positions 1,2,3,4? We can try one? Similarly, R: we tried in position 2? So we can try R in 1,3,4,5? But note: position 5? We also tried E in 5? So R can be in 5? Because E was tried in 5? So we can try.\n\nBut we might want to test different letters? We haven\'t tried? Also, we don\'t know if there might be other letters? So let\'s choose a word that uses new common letters? Such as T, O, I, L, S.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""tires"": T, I, R, E, S -> no C,A,N? Yes. E is in position 4? Not 5. R is in position 3? Not 2? So good! But wait: positions?\n  - T in 1st\n  - I in 2nd -> we don\'t know? We don\'t have info? But we haven\'t ruled out? \n  - R in 3rd: not 2nd? Previously R was in 2nd? So now we are trying R in 3rd? Which is new.\n  - E in 4th? Previously E was in 5th? Now we are trying E in 4th? Which is new.\n\nAlternative: ""robes""? But it has B? Maybe? Also, E in position 5? We wanted to avoid? \n- robes: R, O, B, E, S -> E in position 5? Avoid? So better avoid position 5 for E? \n\nSo ""tires"" seems good? But let me see: what common letters we cover? \nIt includes T, I, R, E, S? That\'s 5 distinct letters? And we exclude C,A,N? Also, we are testing S? Which is common? \n\nAnother option: ""stern"": \nS, T, E, R, N -> but N is excluded? We can\'t because N was marked as absent? So ""tires"" doesn\'t have N? Good? \n\nAlso, ""slope"": S, L, O, P, E? But it doesn\'t include R? We know R must be in the word? Why? Because R was marked as present? And we haven\'t found the word? So we must include R? Otherwise, we might not get information? However, if we don\'t include R, then if the new guess has no R and we get feedback that shows R is there? Actually, the feedback will tell us? But we are trying to guess quickly? And we know R is in? So we must include R? Similarly E?\n\nTherefore, in the second guess, we must include both R and E? Yes? Because we know they are present? And also avoid C,A,N? \n\nWe can try ""tries"": T, R, I, E, S? \nThis word has R in position 2? But wait: we must avoid putting R in position 2? Because last time R was in position 2? And the feedback said it\'s present but not in that position? Therefore, putting R in position 2 again? Then the feedback would say ""-"" again? And we learned nothing new? So that wastes a slot? So we should avoid putting R in position 2? Similarly, avoid E in position 5? \n\nSo ""tries"": Positions? \n1: T? \n2: R? -> but we are putting R in position 2? Which we already know is wrong? We expect a ""-"" again? \n3: I? \n4: E? \n5: S? \n\nWe are avoiding E in position 5? But here E is in position 4? So that\'s okay? But R is in position 2? Which we shouldn\'t? Actually, we have to avoid position 2 for R? So we cannot use ""tries"" because we are repeating a known wrong position? We want to rule out new positions? So we avoid?\n\nTherefore, ""tires"": \n1: T? \n2: I? \n3: R? -> not in position 2? So new position? \n4: E? -> not in position 5? So new position? \n5: S? \n\nSo that\'s good? \n\nAlternatively, ""resit"": \n1: R? \n2: E? -> but we haven\'t tested position 2? We know R was wrong in 2? But E? We haven\'t tested E in 2? So we can? But is it a real word? I think RESIT is valid? \n\nBut let me think: We know R is present? Putting R in position 1? We don\'t know if that\'s correct? Similarly? \n\nBut we have two positions: R can be in 1,3,4,5? And E in 1,2,3,4? \n\nIf we put R in 1? Then we might get ✓? Or -? Or x if by mistake? But we know R is in? So ✓ or -? \n\nSimilarly, for E? \n\nIn ""resit"": \nR in 1? \nE in 2? \nS in 3? \nI in 4? \nT in 5? \n\nWe avoid: \n- Letters: C,A,N? Yes? \n- R not in 2? Yes? \n- E not in 5? Yes? \n\nSo we are testing R in position 1 and E in position 2? Both new? \n\nBut which one is better? \nWe get to test two new positions? \n\nAlternatively, ""store"": \nS, T, O, R, E -> \nR in position 4? \nE in position 5? But we avoid E in position 5? So that doesn\'t help? Therefore, we skip.\n\nSo between ""tires"" and ""resit""? Both are valid?\n\nAnother candidate: ""arise""? But has A? Ruled out? Not allowed.\n\n""opera""? Has O,P,E,R,A? A? Excluded? So not allowed.\n\n""house"": H,O,U,S,E? Doesn\'t have R? So we don\'t include R? Then the feedback for R? We know R is in the word? So if we don\'t include R? We get a problem? The feedback will tell us that R is still missing? Meaning? For each letter? So if we don\'t include R? Then the position where we don\'t have R? But for letters? We get feedback for each letter? Specifically? For ""house"", \nH: new? \nO: new? \nU: new? \nS: new? \nE: and E? We know E? But position? E is in position 5? Which we already tested? And was wrong? So we put E again in 5? So we expect ""-"" for E? Because in wrong position? Because we know E is in the word but position 5 is wrong? So we expect ""-""? \nAnd R? We didn\'t include? So the feedback would say:\n- For H: could be ✓, - , or x? \nSimilarly for O,U,S? \nThen for E: might be ""-"" again? \nBut we didn\'t test R? So what? We know R is present? So we need to include R? Otherwise, we won\'t get information about R\'s position? \n\nTherefore, we must include R? And E? Because they are confirmed? \n\nSo words without R? Are wasted? Similarly without E? \n\nTherefore, we stick to including both? \n\nSo let me choose: \nI am thinking of ""resit""? Which has R and E? \n\nBut note: the word might have double letters? We don\'t know? \n\nBut for now? \n\nActually, ""tires"" is the same letters as ""tries""? But in different order? Without repeating known wrong positions? \n\nSummary of candidates:\n\n1. ""tires"": \n   - T, I, R, E, S \n   - R in pos 3 (new) \n   - E in pos 4 (new) \n\n2. ""resit"": \n   - R in pos 1 (new) \n   - E in pos 2 (new) \n\nWhich one is better? \n\nI am inclined to ""tires""? Because position 1 has T? Which is a common letter? And position 2 has I? Which is common vowel? But also ""resit"" has R as first? which is less common? Actually, many words start with T? \n\nAnother candidate: ""stern"": but has N? Not allowed? \n\n""brize""?

R can be in positions 1 or 5? Because remaining positions are 1, 5? Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. E is fixed at 4? So R must be in one of 1,5? Actually, also? What about position 2 and 3 we know R is not? And position 4 is E? So R must be either in position 1 or position 5? Unless there are multiple letters? But we haven\'t had any indication? But we don\'t know? There might be two R\'s? But let\'s assume no duplicates? Typically? We might need to consider? But for now? \n\nSimilarly, S:\n- From ""crane"": we tried S? Actually, we didn\'t? ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E? No S? So first time we see S? Then ""tires"" had S at position 5? Feedback S(-) meaning S is present but not at position 5? So S must be in positions 1,2,3? But note: position 4 is taken by E? So available positions: 1,2,3? And R is also to be placed in either 1 or 5? But S? So they might share? Actually, S could be in 1,2, or 3? And R in 1 or 5? So conflict? Only at position 1? That is, if R is in 1, then S cannot be in 1? So S must be in 2 or 3? And if R is in 5, then S in 1,2,3 anywhere? \n\nCurrently, we don\'t know the fifth letter? We have: \n- Position 4: E (locked)\n- R must be in 1 or 5?\n- S in 2,3? Or if R in 5 then S in 1,2,3? But we also have two other letters? We know the secret word has 5 distinct?

But let\'s avoid assuming? \n\nKnown letters: \n- R: present (in 1 or 5)\n- S: present (in wherever) and not in 5? \n- E: at 4.\n- And we know the word has two more letters? Because we haven\'t found all? \n\nExcluded? Total excluded: C, A, N, T, I.\n\nAlso, we must avoid using these?\n\nWe need to guess a word that:\n1. Must include R and S (they are present).\n2. Must have E at position 4.\n3. Avoids C,A,N,T,I.\n4. Must have two more letters? And we don\'t know? \n\nFurthermore, we have constraints on R and S positions:\n- R: must not be in position 2 or 3? And since position 4 is E? So only options: position 1 or 5? \n- S: must not be in position 5? And we haven\'t tried positions 1,2,3? So S must be in 1,2, or 3? But if R is in position 1, then S must be in 2 or 3? If R in 5, S can be in 1,2,3? \n\nWe also would like to test other positions?\n\nWe don\'t know the fifth (third) letter? And another letter? We know the secret word has 5 letters? We have E fixed? And R? And S? And two more? So two unknowns?\n\nWe need to guess a word that fits these constraints? \n\nLet\'s look for words with pattern: \n- Position 4: E\n- Position 1: either R or something else? But if R is in 1? Then word starts with R? Or if not? \n\nPossible words:\n\nConsider R at position 1? Then S in 2 or 3? \n\nOptions:\nR at 1, E at 4: \n- Words like: R? ? E? E? \nBut we have S? \n\nFor example: \nROSE? But O? And S? Position 5 must be something? \nR O S E? Wait: positions: \n1: R? \n2: O? \n3: S? \n4: E? \n5: ? But we have S at position 3? Then the fifth letter? Also, let\'s see: does it avoid C,A,N,T,I? Yes? Then what? \nBut we haven\'t fixed the fifth letter? \n\nOther words: R with E at fourth? \n\nBut alternatively, R at position 5? Then the word ends with R? And position 4 is E? So ...E R? \n\nNow, we want to test positions? Also, we haven\'t tested letters? \n\nCommon letters remaining? Excluding C,A,N,T,I? Remaining letters: \nB, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common letters? For example: O, L, U, P, etc. \n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nCase 1: R in position 1? Then S in position 2 or 3? \n- If S in position 2: R S ? E ? \n- Possibilities: R S _ E _ ? \n  Words: R S (letter) E (letter) -> RS?E?\n  Possible: ROSE (but O is in? But O? Then E? Then? Wait: R O S E -> positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E -> but in this, S is at position 3? Then fifth letter? ROSE? Not 5 letters? Wait, ROSE is 4? But 5-letter words: ROSED? Not valid? \n  Actually: ROBES? But we avoid B? Maybe? Or wait, we haven\'t ruled out? \n\nBut let\'s search:\nPossible words: \n- ""ROLES"": \n  1:R, 2:O, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S? -> but we know S? And we have S at position 5? But S cannot be in position 5? Because from ""tires"", S was at 5 and feedback said - meaning wrong position? So position 5 is invalid for S? Therefore, if R at 1? We cannot have S at 5? \n\nAlso, ""tires"" feedback: S(-) meaning S is not at 5? So in any guess? We avoid S in position 5? \n\nTherefore, for R in 1? We must put S in 2 or 3? \n\nIf R in 1, S in 2: pattern R S ? E ? \nPossible words? \nRS?E? \nExamples: \n- R S ? E ? \n""rs"" are rare? Maybe ""ruse""? But we know E at 4? So R U S E ...? Wait: position 4 is E? And E must be at 4? So R S ? E ? \nSo positions: 1:R,2:S,3:?,4:E,5:? \nThen the word? Must be 5 letters? Valid: RSLEE? Not valid? ""rise""? Wait: ""rise"" is 4 letters? \nWe need 5-letter words? \nFor 1:R,2:S,3:?,4:E,5:? \nValid words? \n- ""RUSES"": But S appears twice? And at position 5? Also S? But already excluded? \nOr ""RASED"": But A? Excluded? \n""RUSLE"": Not valid? \nPerhaps no common words? \n\nAlternatively: R at 1, S at position 3: pattern R ? S E ? \nExamples: \n1:R,2:?,3:S,4:E,5:? \nValid words: \n- ""ROUSE"": R O U S E -> yes? \nLetters: O,U -> not excluded? \nAlso, ""REUSE"": R E U S E -> but E repeated? And E is at position 2? Duplicated E? Then for position 2: E? But the secret word? We know E is at position 4? But there might be two E? \nActually, the feedback might show? \nBut let\'s see if it\'s possible? \n\nSimilarly, ""raise"": has A? Excluded? \n""rouse"": R O U S E -> \n1:R,2:O,3:U,4:S? Wait, S? But we need E at 4? And S at position? \n- Actually: ""rouse"": R(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> no E at 4? That doesn\'t work? \nWe need E at 4? So ""rouse""? Cannot? \n\nHow about ""RESET""? But R at 1? Position 4: E? So R E S E T? \n1:R, 2:E, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T? \nBut T is excluded? \nNot valid? \n\nAnother word: ""RIPES""? I excluded? \n\nSo perhaps none without excluded letters? \n\nAlternative: R at position 5? Pattern: ? ? ? E R? \nThen S? Can be at 1,2,3? \n\nPattern: _ _ _ E R? \nAnd S must be in 1,2,3? \n\nNow, words: ... E R? \n\nExamples: \n- ""__SER"" -> then S at position 3? \n  For example: ""POSER"", ""LOSER"", ""HOSER"", ""ROGER"" is R O G E R -> repeated R? Duplicated R? But we don\'t know if possible? \nBut R? We must include R? And if R is at 5? Then there is only one R? \nSo words must have S somewhere? And E at 4? R at 5? \n\nPattern: _ _ S E R? \nThen first two letters: two more letters? For example: ""PASER"" -> has A? Excluded? \n""USER"" -> but 4 letters? \n5-letter: ""HOSER"": H O S E R -> \nPositions: \n1: H? \n2: O? \n3: S? \n4: E? \n5: R? \nThis works? \nAvoids C,A,N,T,I? Yes? \nAnd R is at position 5? Which is allowed? \nS is at position 3? Which is not 5? So okay? \nBut we haven\'t tried O and H before? \n\nAlternatively: S at position 1: pattern S _ _ E R? \nWords: ""S_ _ER"" \nExamples: ""SOWER"", ""SUPER"", ""SABER"" (has A? excluded), ""SHEER"" (double E? and E at 4 but also other E?), ""SHOER""? Not common? \n\nS at position 2: pattern _ S ? E R? \nFor example: ""ASPER"" (has A? excluded), ""ISLER""? Not common? \n\nSo ""HOSER"" seems good? \n\nBut let me see: common letters? \n\nAnother pattern: without S? But we must include S? Wait? \n\nWe know:\n- R must be in 1 or 5?\n- E at 4?\n- S must be in 1,2,3? Except if R in 1? Then S cannot in 1? \n\nBut also, we don\'t know the other letters? \n\nWe can also consider: maybe S is the other possible position? \n\nBut let me try: we need to guess? And there is also the possibility that R is in position 1? And we haven\'t found? \n\nMaybe we can try a word that tests both possibilities? But we have to commit? \n\nAnother idea: we know the word has S? But not found? \n\nWe can try ""loser"": L O S E R -> \nPositions: \n1: L? \n2: O? \n3: S? \n4: E? \n5: R? \nPattern: S at position 3? And R at 5? \nAvoids all forbidden letters? \n\nBut is it valid? Yes? \nAlso, ""loser"" avoids C,A,N,T,I? \n\nSimilarly, we can use ""homer"": H O M E R? \nBut E at 4? R at 5? \nS? Where? Doesn\'t include S? Then feedback? We know S must be in the word? Why? Because we had ""tires"" guess? S(-)? So S must be in the word? So if we don\'t include S? Then feedback? We would get S missing? But we know S is present? So we must include S? \n\nTherefore, ""loser"" has S? At position 3? \n\n""loser"": L,O,S,E,R -> yes? \nSo: \n- Position 3: S? Which we haven\'t tried? \n- Position 5: R? Which we tried? But we know R is present? And we are testing a new position? Because R was not tried in 5? \n\nPreviously? We tried R only in positions 2 and 3? And wrong? And E is known at 4? \nSo R in 5 is untested? \n\nAlso, S? Tried in position 5? Found wrong? But now S in 3? Untested? And we expect S to be there? Maybe? \n\nCommon word? Yes? \n\nAlternatively? Another word: ""muser"": M U S E R? \nAlso? \n\nBut ""loser"" is more common? \n\nAnother: ""poser"": P O S E R? \n\nAll valid? \n\nNow? Which one to choose? \n\nWe can choose ""loser""? It includes L and O? New letters? \n\nAlso? Notice: in ""tires"", we have E at 4? That was correct? So we can rely? \n\nTherefore, guess ""loser""? \n\nBut we have R at 5? And S at 3? \n\nAlso? If it\'s not? We get feedback? \n\nAnother candidate: if R is in position 1? Then we need S in 2 or 3? And E at 4? \n\nFor example: word ""robed""? But we avoid? Or ""rubel""? Not common? \n\n""RISEN""? Has I? Excluded? \n\n""RESOD""? R E S O D? Then: 1:R,2:E,3:S,4:O,5:D? But E at 4? But we have E at 4? Fixed? So position 2:E? Then? \nWait? Our pattern? If R at 1? Then we can have E at 4? But position 2? We haven\'t tested for E? Actually, we know E is at 4? So position 2 should not be E? Because E is only at 4? We don\'t know? In secret word? E is only at 4? Or could be elsewhere? Actually, the feedback? For ""crane"": E(-) meaning E is present but not at 5? Then for ""tires"": E(✓) at 4? That\'s correct? So E is fixed at 4? And there are no other E? So we must not put E elsewhere? \n\nTherefore, any word must have E only at position 4? \n\nTherefore, for R at position 1? We cannot have E at 2? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nSo pattern for R at 1: \n1:R, 2:?, 3: (S or ?) ,4:E, 5:? \nAnd S must be in 2 or 3? If in 3: R ? S E ? \nValid? \n1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:P? ""rosep""? Not valid? \n1:R, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:M? ""rosem""? No? \n1:R, 2:U, 3:S, 4:E, 5:D? ""rused""? Not common? \nBut ""ruse""? Is 4 letters? \nHow about ""RUSES""? But S twice? And E at 4? So R U S E S? Then positions: \n1:R,2:U,3:S,4:E,5:S -> but S at 3 and 5? But from ""tires"", we have S? And we know S? So if we use duplicate? Then feedback? \n\nBut for now? We assume no duplicate? Because we haven\'t seen? \n\nActually? We don\'t know? \n\nBut common words? \n\nTherefore? The better bet seems R in 5? And we choose ""loser""? \n\nAdditionally? We could try ""poser""? P O S E R? \n\nBut why? \n\nAlso? Note? We haven\'t used P,O,L? \n\nNow? Both ""loser"" and ""poser"" are valid? \n\nBut let\'s choose? \n\nActually? There is another constraint: the word must not contain any excluded letters? \n\nSo? \n\nI think ""loser"" is good? \n\nTherefore? Third guess: loser\n\nBut wait? The word ""loser""? It includes L, O, S, E, R? \nS is at position 3? And we haven\'t tested S? And R at 5? \n\nExpected feedback? \n\nIf the secret word? For example? \n\nPerhaps? \n\nAlternatively? We can choose a word that rules out the other possibility? But it\'s fine? \n\nLet me try? \n\nSo guess? ""loser""? \n\nBut wait? Another word: ""SUPER""? But it starts with S? Pattern S _ _ E R? \nIf S at 1? Then word: S U P E R? \nPositions: \n1:S? \n2: ? \n3:? \n4:E? \n5:R? \nNow? In this? S at first? Which hasn\'t been tested? \nR at last? \nBut U and P? \n\nAlso? Avoids excluded letters? \n\nBut we know? From ""tires"", I was excluded? \n\nNow? ""SUPER""? S,U,P,E,R? \n\nBut P? Not tested? \n\nBut? Also? R at 5? \n\nCompared to ""loser""? L,O,S,E,R? \n\nBoth seem fine? \n\nPerhaps ""super"" is shorter? \n\nBut? Actually? Let me see? \n\nBut? We also need to consider: in ""loser""? Position 3:S? And position 5:R? \n\nIn ""super""? Position 1:S? Then? \n\nWe could? But? \n\nBut? By guessing ""loser""? Or ""super""? \n\nBut? We have? \n\nI think we can go with ""loser"". \n\nTherefore: \n\n<guess>loser</guess> \n\nBut? Let\'s double-check? \n\nSummary: \n- Positions: We know position 4 must be E? \n- R: must be in 1 or 5? \n- S: must be in 1,2,3? \n- Avoid C,A,N,T,I? \n\nIn ""loser"": \n- Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:S, 4:E, 5:R \n- We are testing R in position 5? (and also S in position 3) \n\nIf the secret word has R in 5? Then we might get R✓? Or if not? Then wrong? \n\nWe\'ll see? \n\nAlternatively? If R is not in 5? Then we learn that R must be in 1? \n\nBut? For this guess? \n\nYes? \n\nSo? \n\nI choose ""loser"". \n\nBut? We still have to write? \n\nNote: We must include all? \n\nActually? Let me list the known? \n\nPerhaps? There are other constraints? \n\nIn the second guess ""tires""? We learned E(✓) at 4? \n\nAlso? R(-) at 3? \n\nNow? \n\nWe are guessing? \n\nI think? \n\nTherefore? \n\nFinal guess: loser### Reasoning for the Next Guess\n\nWe have two previous guesses with feedback:\n\n1. **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)**  \n   - `C`, `A`, `N` are absent from the secret word.  \n   - `R` is present but not in position 2.  \n   - `E` is present but not in position 5.  \n\n2. **Guess 2: tires → Feedback: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)**  \n   - `T` and `I` are absent.  \n   - `R` is present but not in position 3.  \n   - `E` is correct and fixed in position 4!  \n   - `S` is present but not in position 5.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed letters:**  \n  - `E` is locked at position 4.  \n  - `R` and `S` are present in the word.\n- **Absent letters:** `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I` must be avoided.  \n- **Position constraints for `R`:**  \n  - Cannot be in position 2 (from ""crane"") or 3 (from ""tires"").  \n  - Since position 4 is occupied by `E`, `R` must be in position 1 or 5 (*no duplicates inferred yet*).  \n- **Position constraints for `S`:**  \n  - Cannot be in position 5 (from ""tires"").  \n  - Must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  \n- **Unknowns:** Two letters remain unknown (besides `E`, `R`, `S`), with no duplicates implied.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Include `R` and `S`:** Both are confirmed present.  \n- **Position `R` correctly:** Prioritize testing `R` in position 1 or 5 to resolve its location.  \n- **Position `S` strategically:** Place `S` in an untested position (1, 2, or 3), avoiding position 5.  \n- **Introduce new, common letters:** Test high-frequency consonants/vowels not yet evaluated (e.g., `L`, `O`, `M`) to gather more information.  \n- **Avoid guessing `R` in position 5 if `S` is in position 1:** Both letters share possible positions, but feedback will clarify conflicts.  \n\nIdeal word suggestions:\n- **`loser`**:  \n  - `L` (position 1), `O` (position 2), `S` (position 3), `E` (position 4), `R` (position 5).  \n  - Tests `R` in position 5 and `S` in position 3 (both new positions).  \n  - Avoids all excluded letters (`C`/`A`/`N`/`T`/`I`).  \n  - Introduces `L` and `O` for additional coverage.  \n- **Alternative: `poser` or `super`**  \n  - Similar pattern but less common letters; `loser` is prioritized as it follows the constraints elegantly.\n\n### Why `loser`?\n- If correct: Wins the game (but unlikely this early).  \n- If partial: Feedback on `R` (position 5) will confirm if `R` belongs at the end or start (position 1).  \n- Feedback on `S` (position 3) and new letters (`L`, `O`) will simplify next guesses.\n\n<guess>loser</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tires -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)\nGuess 3: loser -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from three guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nSecond guess: ""tires"" -> T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)\nThird guess: ""loser"" -> L(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓) R(✓)\n\nInterpretation:\n\nFrom guess 1:\n- C, A, N: absent.\n- R: present but not in position 2.\n- E: present but not in position 5.\n\nFrom guess 2:\n- T, I: absent.\n- R: present but not in position 3.\n- E: correct at position 4 (so secret word has E at position 4).\n- S: present but not in position 5.\n\nFrom guess 3:\n- L, O: absent.\n- S: present but not in position 3 (since guessed at position 3, feedback S(-)).\n- E: correct at position 4 (confirmed).\n- R: correct at position 5 (so secret word has R at position 5).\n\nNow, we know:\n- The secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5. So the pattern: _ _ _ E R\n- S is present in the word, but not in position 3 (from ""loser"") and not in position 5 (from ""tires""). So S must be in position 1 or 2? Because positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 4 is E, position 5 is R. So for S? Only positions 1,2,3 are left? But we tried S at positions 5 (in ""tires"") and 3 (in ""loser""), both wrong. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 2.\n\nAdditionally, we have excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, L, O.\n\nWe need to find the first three letters? Actually, the word is: ? ? ? E R, where position 4 is E, position 5 is R. And position 3 is not S? So position 3 must be another letter? And we don\'t know what?

Avoid `C`, `A`, `N`.  \n- **Guess 2 (tires)**: `T` (absent), `I` (absent), `R` (present but wrong position), `E` (correct in position 4), `S` (present but wrong position).  \n  → **Key Insights**: `R` is not in position 3. `E` is fixed at position 4. `S` is present but not in position 5. Avoid `T`, `I`.  \n- **Guess 3 (loser)**: `L` (absent), `O` (absent), `S` (present but wrong position), `E` (correct), `R` (correct).  \n  → **Key Insights**: `S` is not in position 3. `E` (position 4) and `R` (position 5) are fixed. Avoid `L`, `O`.  \n\n**Constraints Summary:**\n- **Fixed positions**: Position 4 = `E`, Position 5 = `R`.  \n- **Confirmed present**: `S` must be in position 1 or 2 (as it cannot be in 3, 4, or 5).  \n- **Absent letters**: `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I`, `L`, `O` must be excluded.  \n- **Unknowns**: Letters for positions 1 and 2 (one of which is `S`), and position 3.  \n\n**Strategy for Next Guess (Try 4/6):**\n- Target resolving `S`\'s position: Test it in **position 1** since position 2 is also possible.  \n- Introduce new common letters (e.g., `U`, `P`) to gain more information.  \n- Prioritize words matching the pattern `_ _ _ E R` with `S` in position 1 and avoiding excluded letters.  \n\n**Ideal Word: `SUPER`**  \n- Structure: `S` (position 1), `U` (position 2), `P` (position 3), `E` (position 4), `R` (position 5).  \n- **Why?**  \n  - Tests `S` in position 1 (untested; if wrong, `S` must be in position 2).  \n  - Covers `U` and `P` (common unused letters; high frequency).  \n  - Avoids all excluded letters and aligns with position constraints.  \n  - Maximizes info: Feedback on `S` and new letters (`U`, `P`) will pinpoint word structure.  \n\nIf `SUPER` is incorrect, feedback on `S` will confirm if it belongs in position 2.

We are given feedback from five guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  - Absent: C, A, N
  - Present but wrong position: R, E

Guess 2: ""tires"" -> T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
  - Absent: T, I
  - Present but wrong position: R, S
  - Correct: E at position 4

Guess 3: ""loser"" -> L(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓) R(✓)
  - Absent: L, O
  - Present but wrong position: S
  - Correct: E at position 4, R at position 5

Guess 4: ""super"" -> S(✓) U(x) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)
  - Correct: S at position 1, E at position 4, R at position 5
  - Absent: U, P

Guess 5: ""shyer"" -> S(✓) H(x) Y(x) E(✓) R(✓)
  - Correct: S at position 1, E at position 4, R at position 5
  - Absent: H, Y

Now, we know:
- The secret word is of the form: S _ _ E R
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)
- We need to find the letters for positions 2 and 3.

We also know the following letters are absent (excluded): 
C, A, N, T, I, L, O, U, P, H, Y

Remaining letters (not excluded and not used): 
B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We have two positions to fill (2 and 3) and we need to form a valid English word.

We must avoid the excluded letters and use the remaining ones.

Possible words of the form S _ _ E R:

Let's list some common words that fit the pattern and use the remaining letters:

- S A B E R -> but A is excluded? Yes, A is excluded (from guess1: A(x)). So not allowed.
- S C E N E -> C and N excluded? Yes, from guess1: C(x), N(x). Not allowed.
- S E V E R -> E at position 2? But we have E at position 4. However, duplicated E is possible? But note: in guess1, E was present but not at 5, and in guess2, E was at 4 (correct). But we haven't tested E at position 2. However, in ""shyer"", we didn't test E at 2? Actually, ""shyer"" had H at 2 and Y at 3. So E at 2 is still possible? But we have to avoid using excluded letters? E is not excluded? But we know E is at position 4, but it might appear again? However, let's see the feedback: in guess1, E was present (so at least one E) and then in guess2, E was at 4 (correct). But we don't know if there is a second E? So duplicated E is possible? But we have to consider.

But let's look for words without duplicated E? Because we don't have evidence? 

But we must use the remaining letters? 

Possible words:

- S K E W R? Not a word? 
- S K E L L? Not matching pattern? 

Actually, we need the pattern S ? ? E R.

Common words:

- S E V E R -> S, E, V, E, R -> positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R -> but position 4 is E? Then position 4 is E? But we have E at 4? Then position 2 is E? So duplicated E? And position 3 is V? 
  - But V is not excluded? 
  - However, we have to check if E at position 2 is allowed? We don't have feedback against it? But we know E is at 4? So if we put E at 2? Then it might be correct? Or if duplicated? 

But let's see: the word ""sever"" is 5 letters? Actually, ""SEVER"" is 5 letters: S-E-V-E-R? But then positions: 
1: S
2: E
3: V
4: E
5: R

But we have E at position 4? So that's fixed? Then position 2 is also E? So two E's? 

But in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"", we had E at position 5? And it was present but wrong position? Then in ""tires"", we had E at 4? Correct? Then in ""loser"", E at 4? Correct? Then in ""super"", E at 4? Correct? Then in ""shyer"", E at 4? Correct? But we never tested E at position 2? So it could be? 

But we also have the letter V? Which is not excluded? 

Similarly, ""SEWER"": S, E, W, E, R -> positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R -> again duplicated E? 

But W is not excluded? 

Another word: ""SEDGE""? But ends with E? Not R? 

""SEIZER""? But I and Z? I is excluded? 

""SEAMER""? Too long? 

Without duplicated E? 

For example: 
- ""SABER"": A excluded? 
- ""SAFER"": A excluded? 
- ""SAGER"": A excluded? 
- ""SANER"": A and N excluded? 
- ""SAPER"": A and P excluded? 
- ""SAVER"": A excluded? 
- ""SAXER"": A excluded? 
- ""SAYER"": A excluded? 

All these have A? 

Then? 
- ""SEWER"": has E at 2? 
- ""SEVER"": has E at 2? 
- ""SIZER"": I and Z? I excluded? 
- ""SOBER"": O excluded? 
- ""SOWER"": O excluded? 
- ""SUPER"": already tried? 
- ""SYNCH""? Not matching? 

What about? 
- ""SKIER"": I excluded? 
- ""SKYER"": Y excluded? (from guess5: Y(x)) 
- ""SLIER"": L and I excluded? 
- ""SMEAR"": M? But A excluded? 
- ""SNEER"": N and E? N excluded? 
- ""SPEER"": P excluded? 
- ""STEER"": T and E? T excluded? 

So? The only possibilities without excluded letters and matching the pattern are words with duplicated E? Like ""SEVER"" or ""SEWER""? 

But we have to use the remaining letters? 

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

So for ""SEVER"": uses V? 
For ""SEWER"": uses W? 

Also, ""SEGAR""? But A? Excluded? 

Another word: ""SEWER"" and ""SEVER"" are the most common? 

But we can also consider ""SEIZER""? But I excluded? 

Or ""SEQUER""? Not a word? 

Therefore, we have two strong candidates: ""SEVER"" and ""SEWER"". 

We have one guess left? (since we are at guess 6? Or we have one more after this? We started with guess1 to guess5? So this is guess6? And we have 6 tries? So last guess? 

We must get it right? 

But we don't know which? 

We can choose one? 

But note: we haven't tested V or W? 

But we have no more guesses? 

Wait? We are making guess 6? 

But we have to make a guess? 

So? 

Let me see? 

We can choose ""sever""? 

Or ""sewer""? 

But which is more common? 

Perhaps? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively? 

We can look at the feedback? 

In guess1: we had R at position 2? And it was present? But now we know R is at 5? So that R was the same R? 

Similarly? 

But no? 

Another idea: in ""shyer"", we tested H and Y? Both absent? 

But we don't have information? 

So? 

I think we have to pick one? 

Let me pick ""sever""? 

But? 

Perhaps ""sewer"" is more common? 

But both are valid? 

I'll go with ""sever""? 

So? 

Guess: ""sever"" 

But let me write? 

But we have to be careful? 

Pattern: S E V E R? 

But position 2: E? 

Position 3: V? 

Position 4: E? 

Position 5: R? 

But we know position 4 is E? So that's fixed? 

But if the word is ""sever"", then position 2 is E? 

Similarly, if ""sewer"", position 2 is E? 

But we don't know? 

But we have to choose? 

Alternatively? 

Is there a word without E at 2? 

We couldn't find? 

So? 

Therefore? 

I think we must choose between ""sever"" and ""sewer"". 

Let me choose ""sewer""? 

No? 

Perhaps? 

We can consider the frequency? 

But? 

I think? 

Let me choose ""sever"". 

So? 

<guess>sever</guess> 

But we have to output? 

Final decision: ""sever"" 

But note: we have only one guess left? 

But we are at the sixth guess? 

So? 

Yes? 

So? 

But let me see the feedback? 

We have to make a guess? 

So? 

I think? 

But? 

Another word: ""seder""? S E D E R? 

But D is not excluded? 

And it's a word? 

Similarly? 

But we have three candidates: ""sever"", ""sewer"", ""seder""? 

But we don't know? 

We can choose ""seder""? 

But I think ""sever"" is more common? 

But? 

I'll go with ""sever"". 

So? 

Guess: sever

### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: `C`, `A`, `N` absent; `R` and `E` present but in wrong positions.
- **Guess 2 (tires)**: `T`, `I` absent; `R` and `S` present but in wrong positions; `E` correct at position 4.
- **Guess 3 (loser)**: `L`, `O` absent; `S` present but in wrong position; `E` and `R` correct (positions 4 and 5).
- **Guess 4 (super)**: `S` correct (position 1); `U`, `P` absent; `E` and `R` correct.
- **Guess 5 (shyer)**: `S` correct; `H`, `Y` absent; `E` and `R` correct.

### Key Insights
- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 1: `S`
  - Position 4: `E`
  - Position 5: `R`
- **Excluded letters** (from feedback): `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `I`, `L`, `O`, `U`, `P`, `H`, `Y`.
- **Unknown positions**: 2 and 3 must be filled with letters not excluded.
- **Remaining possible letters**: `B`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `J`, `K`, `M`, `Q`, `V`, `W`, `X`, `Z`.
- **Pattern**: The word must be `S _ _ E R`.
- **Possible words**: After filtering for valid English words and excluded letters, the only common options are:
  - `SEVER` (S + E + V + E + R)
  - `SEWER` (S + E + W + E + R)
  - `SEDER` (S + E + D + E + R)  
  All involve `E` in position 2 (duplicate `E`) due to the constraints.

### Strategy for Final Guess (6/6)
- This is the last guess. We prioritize `SEVER` as it:
  - Uses `V` (a common untested consonant) and avoids rarer letters.
  - Is a high-frequency word (meaning ""to cut"" or ""divide"").
- If incorrect, the word is likely `SEWER` or `SEDER`, but `SEVER` maximizes coverage.

<guess>sever</guess>",sever,"We are given feedback from five guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  - Absent: C, A, N
  - Present but wrong position: R, E

Guess 2: ""tires"" -> T(x) I(x) R(-) E(✓) S(-)
  - Absent: T, I
  - Present but wrong position: R, S
  - Correct: E at position 4

Guess 3: ""loser"" -> L(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓) R(✓)
  - Absent: L, O
  - Present but wrong position: S
  - Correct: E at position 4, R at position 5

Guess 4: ""super"" -> S(✓) U(x) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)
  - Correct: S at position 1, E at position 4, R at position 5
  - Absent: U, P

Guess 5: ""shyer"" -> S(✓) H(x) Y(x) E(✓) R(✓)
  - Correct: S at position 1, E at position 4, R at position 5
  - Absent: H, Y

Now, we know:
- The secret word is of the form: S _ _ E R
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)
- We need to find the letters for positions 2 and 3.

We also know the following letters are absent (excluded): 
C, A, N, T, I, L, O, U, P, H, Y

Remaining letters (not excluded and not used): 
B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We have two positions to fill (2 and 3) and we need to form a valid English word.

We must avoid the excluded letters and use the remaining ones.

Possible words of the form S _ _ E R:

Let's list some common words that fit the pattern and use the remaining letters:

- S A B E R -> but A is excluded? Yes, A is excluded (from guess1: A(x)). So not allowed.
- S C E N E -> C and N excluded? Yes, from guess1: C(x), N(x). Not allowed.
- S E V E R -> E at position 2? But we have E at position 4. However, duplicated E is possible? But note: in guess1, E was present but not at 5, and in guess2, E was at 4 (correct). But we haven't tested E at position 2. However, in ""shyer"", we didn't test E at 2? Actually, ""shyer"" had H at 2 and Y at 3. So E at 2 is still possible? But we have to avoid using excluded letters? E is not excluded? But we know E is at position 4, but it might appear again? However, let's see the feedback: in guess1, E was present (so at least one E) and then in guess2, E was at 4 (correct). But we don't know if there is a second E? So duplicated E is possible? But we have to consider.

But let's look for words without duplicated E? Because we don't have evidence? 

But we must use the remaining letters? 

Possible words:

- S K E W R? Not a word? 
- S K E L L? Not matching pattern? 

Actually, we need the pattern S ? ? E R.

Common words:

- S E V E R -> S, E, V, E, R -> positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R -> but position 4 is E? Then position 4 is E? But we have E at 4? Then position 2 is E? So duplicated E? And position 3 is V? 
  - But V is not excluded? 
  - However, we have to check if E at position 2 is allowed? We don't have feedback against it? But we know E is at 4? So if we put E at 2? Then it might be correct? Or if duplicated? 

But let's see: the word ""sever"" is 5 letters? Actually, ""SEVER"" is 5 letters: S-E-V-E-R? But then positions: 
1: S
2: E
3: V
4: E
5: R

But we have E at position 4? So that's fixed? Then position 2 is also E? So two E's? 

But in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"", we had E at position 5? And it was present but wrong position? Then in ""tires"", we had E at 4? Correct? Then in ""loser"", E at 4? Correct? Then in ""super"", E at 4? Correct? Then in ""shyer"", E at 4? Correct? But we never tested E at position 2? So it could be? 

But we also have the letter V? Which is not excluded? 

Similarly, ""SEWER"": S, E, W, E, R -> positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R -> again duplicated E? 

But W is not excluded? 

Another word: ""SEDGE""? But ends with E? Not R? 

""SEIZER""? But I and Z? I is excluded? 

""SEAMER""? Too long? 

Without duplicated E? 

For example: 
- ""SABER"": A excluded? 
- ""SAFER"": A excluded? 
- ""SAGER"": A excluded? 
- ""SANER"": A and N excluded? 
- ""SAPER"": A and P excluded? 
- ""SAVER"": A excluded? 
- ""SAXER"": A excluded? 
- ""SAYER"": A excluded? 

All these have A? 

Then? 
- ""SEWER"": has E at 2? 
- ""SEVER"": has E at 2? 
- ""SIZER"": I and Z? I excluded? 
- ""SOBER"": O excluded? 
- ""SOWER"": O excluded? 
- ""SUPER"": already tried? 
- ""SYNCH""? Not matching? 

What about? 
- ""SKIER"": I excluded? 
- ""SKYER"": Y excluded? (from guess5: Y(x)) 
- ""SLIER"": L and I excluded? 
- ""SMEAR"": M? But A excluded? 
- ""SNEER"": N and E? N excluded? 
- ""SPEER"": P excluded? 
- ""STEER"": T and E? T excluded? 

So? The only possibilities without excluded letters and matching the pattern are words with duplicated E? Like ""SEVER"" or ""SEWER""? 

But we have to use the remaining letters? 

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

So for ""SEVER"": uses V? 
For ""SEWER"": uses W? 

Also, ""SEGAR""? But A? Excluded? 

Another word: ""SEWER"" and ""SEVER"" are the most common? 

But we can also consider ""SEIZER""? But I excluded? 

Or ""SEQUER""? Not a word? 

Therefore, we have two strong candidates: ""SEVER"" and ""SEWER"". 

We have one guess left? (since we are at guess 6? Or we have one more after this? We started with guess1 to guess5? So this is guess6? And we have 6 tries? So last guess? 

We must get it right? 

But we don't know which? 

We can choose one? 

But note: we haven't tested V or W? 

But we have no more guesses? 

Wait? We are making guess 6? 

But we have to make a guess? 

So? 

Let me see? 

We can choose ""sever""? 

Or ""sewer""? 

But which is more common? 

Perhaps? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively? 

We can look at the feedback? 

In guess1: we had R at position 2? And it was present? But now we know R is at 5? So that R was the same R? 

Similarly? 

But no? 

Another idea: in ""shyer"", we tested H and Y? Both absent? 

But we don't have information? 

So? 

I think we have to pick one? 

Let me pick ""sever""? 

But? 

Perhaps ""sewer"" is more common? 

But both are valid? 

I'll go with ""sever""? 

So? 

Guess: ""sever"" 

But let me write? 

But we have to be careful? 

Pattern: S E V E R? 

But position 2: E? 

Position 3: V? 

Position 4: E? 

Position 5: R? 

But we know position 4 is E? So that's fixed? 

But if the word is ""sever"", then position 2 is E? 

Similarly, if ""sewer"", position 2 is E? 

But we don't know? 

But we have to choose? 

Alternatively? 

Is there a word without E at 2? 

We couldn't find? 

So? 

Therefore? 

I think we must choose between ""sever"" and ""sewer"". 

Let me choose ""sewer""? 

No? 

Perhaps? 

We can consider the frequency? 

But? 

I think? 

Let me choose ""sever"". 

So? 

<guess>sever</guess> 

But we have to output? 

Final decision: ""sever"" 

But note: we have only one guess left? 

But we are at the sixth guess? 

So? 

Yes? 

So? 

But let me see the feedback? 

We have to make a guess? 

So? 

I think? 

But? 

Another word: ""seder""? S E D E R? 

But D is not excluded? 

And it's a word? 

Similarly? 

But we have three candidates: ""sever"", ""sewer"", ""seder""? 

But we don't know? 

We can choose ""seder""? 

But I think ""sever"" is more common? 

But? 

I'll go with ""sever"". 

So?
