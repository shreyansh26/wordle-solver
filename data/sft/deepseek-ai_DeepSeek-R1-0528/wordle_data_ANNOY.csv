We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A and N are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 3 and 4 respectively).

Since A and N are in the word, we must include them in our next guess, but in different positions.

We also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, or E.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Does not contain C, R, E.
  - Contains A and N.
  - Places A and N in positions different from 3 and 4 (since in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and N at position 4).

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible positions for A and N:
  - A cannot be at position 3.
  - N cannot be at position 4.

We can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 and N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

But note: we also want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should avoid using letters we know are not in the word (C, R, E).

Let's try to form a word that includes A and N and three new letters.

Example words:
  - ""sandy"": contains S, A, N, D, Y. But note: A is at position 2 (which is new) and N at position 4? Wait, in ""sandy"": 
        S (1), A (2), N (3), D (4), Y (5)
    But in our feedback, N was at position 4 in the first guess and was marked as present but wrong position. 
    Now we are putting N at position 3? That's allowed because it's a different position.

  However, we must check if the word is valid.

But note: we don't know if S, D, Y are in the word or not.

Alternatively, we can try ""adorn"": 
  A (1), D (2), O (3), R (4), N (5) -> but R is not allowed because we know R is not in the word.

We must avoid R.

Another word: ""plain"": 
  P (1), L (2), A (3), I (4), N (5) -> but A is at position 3 again? We know from feedback that A is not at position 3. 
  So we cannot put A at position 3.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

How about ""paint"": 
  P (1), A (2), I (3), N (4), T (5) -> 
    A is at position 2 (new) and N is at position 4? But in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we were told it's in the word but wrong position. 
    So we cannot put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can because the feedback only said it was in the word but not at position 4. 
    However, if we put it again at position 4, we might get the same feedback. But we are allowed to try, but it's inefficient.

We want to test N in a new position. So ideally, we put N in a position that is not 4.

Similarly, A should not be at position 3.

So let's try to put A at position 1 and N at position 5? Or A at position 2 and N at position 1, etc.

Word: ""mania"": 
  M (1), A (2), N (3), I (4), A (5) -> but has duplicate A? Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the secret word might not have duplicates. 
  Moreover, we are not sure about the letters.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" had two different letters (A and N) and they were both present. So the secret word has at least one A and one N.

We should avoid using duplicate letters for now to maximize information.

Another word: ""saint"": 
  S (1), A (2), I (3), N (4), T (5) -> 
    A is at position 2 (new) and N is at position 4 (same as before). 
    We know N is not at position 4, so if we put it again at 4, we expect it to be marked as '-' again? 
    But we want to test N in a new position? 

Alternatively, we can try ""taint"": 
  T (1), A (2), I (3), N (4), T (5) -> duplicate T and N at position 4 again.

Not ideal.

Word: ""nasty"": 
  N (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), Y (5) -> 
    Here, N is at position 1 (new) and A at position 2 (new). 
    This seems good because we are testing both A and N in new positions.

But note: in the first guess, A was at position 3 and now we are putting it at position 2. Similarly, N was at 4 and now at 1.

So ""nasty"" uses:
  N (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), Y (5)

We avoid C, R, E.

This word is valid.

We can also consider ""pants"": 
  P (1), A (2), N (3), T (4), S (5) -> 
    A at 2, N at 3 (which is new because previously N was at 4). 
    This also avoids the known bad positions.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters, but we are using distinct letters.

Both ""nasty"" and ""pants"" are good.

Another option: ""dance"" -> but E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word.

So avoid E.

Let me choose ""nasty"" because it uses common letters and we get to test N at the start and A in the second position.

So our second guess: ""nasty""

We'll see what feedback we get.

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has S, T, or Y, but that's the point of guessing.

So, the next guess is ""nasty"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- A and N are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include A and N, but avoid positions 3 and 4 (since A was at position 3 and N at position 4 in ""crane"").
- Exclude C, R, and E entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, Y) and positions to maximize information.

The word ""nasty"" fits these criteria:
- Places A at position 2 (new position) and N at position 1 (new position).
- Introduces S, T, and Y as new letters.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, E) and positions for A and N.

So, the next guess is ""nasty"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- A and N are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include A and N, but avoid positions 3 and 4 (since A was at position 3 and N at position 4 in ""crane"").
- Exclude C, R, and E entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, Y) and positions to maximize information.

The word ""nasty"" fits these criteria:
- Places A at position 2 (new position) and N at position 1 (new position).
- Introduces S, T, and Y as new letters.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, E) and positions for A and N.

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
  Meaning:
    - C, R, E are not in the word.
    - A and N are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

Guess 2: ""nasty"" -> Feedback: N(-) A(-) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)
  Meaning:
    - N is in the word but not at position 1 (since we put it at position 1 and got '-')
    - A is in the word but not at position 2 (since we put it at position 2 and got '-')
    - S and T are not in the word (x)
    - Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter Y at position 5.
2. The secret word contains A and N, but we don't know their positions yet. We know they are not at:
   - A: not at position 3 (from ""crane"") and not at position 2 (from ""nasty"")
   - N: not at position 4 (from ""crane"") and not at position 1 (from ""nasty"")
3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, E, S, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, Y (but only A, N, Y are in the word, and Y is fixed at position 5).

We need to make a third guess that:
- Must have Y at position 5.
- Must include A and N (each exactly once, unless we suspect duplicates, but we don't have evidence for duplicates so we assume single occurrence).
- A cannot be at position 2 or 3.
- N cannot be at position 1 or 4.
- Avoid the letters: C, R, E, S, T.

Possible positions for A: 1, 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are excluded, and position 5 is taken by Y).
Possible positions for N: 2, 3, 5 (but position 5 is Y, so only 2 or 3).

But note: position 5 is fixed for Y, so A and N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, but with constraints.

Specifically:
- A can be at positions 1 or 4 (because not 2 or 3).
- N can be at positions 2 or 3 (because not 1 or 4).

So the word must have:
  Position 1: either A or another letter (but not N because N can't be at 1, and not the excluded letters)
  Position 2: either N or another letter (but not A because A can't be at 2, and not excluded)
  Position 3: either N or another letter (but not A because A can't be at 3, and not excluded)
  Position 4: either A or another letter (but not N because N can't be at 4, and not excluded)
  Position 5: Y

We also need to include both A and N.

So the possibilities for the structure:

Option 1: A at 1 and N at 2 or 3.
Option 2: A at 4 and N at 2 or 3.

We also need to fill the remaining positions with letters that are not excluded and not A, N, Y (since we are assuming no duplicates for now).

Excluded letters: C, R, E, S, T.

We can use other common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We want to maximize information by trying new letters.

Let's try to form words:

First, if A is at position 1 and N at position 2:
  Word: A, N, ?, ?, Y
  The third and fourth positions must be filled with two new letters (not A, N, Y, and not excluded).

  Example: ""ANGRY"" -> A(1), N(2), G(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but R is excluded. Not allowed.

  ""ANGLY"": A(1), N(2), G(3), L(4), Y(5) -> 
      Letters: A, N, G, L, Y. 
      G and L are new and allowed.

  Is ""angly"" a word? Not a common word. ""Angly"" is not valid.

  ""ANDY"" is only 4 letters.

  ""ANKHY"" -> not a word.

  ""ANIMY"" -> not a word.

  ""ANNOY"": A(1), N(2), N(3), O(4), Y(5) -> but duplicate N? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven't seen evidence. Also, we are using N twice, which might not be efficient.

  But note: we have to include A and N, and we are putting N at position 2 and also at 3? That would be two N's. We don't know if the word has two N's. But we only know one N is present from the feedback? Actually, the feedback only told us that there is at least one N. There could be more, but we don't know.

  However, to avoid complexity, let's assume one occurrence for now.

  Alternatively, A at 1 and N at 3:
    Word: A, ?, N, ?, Y

    Example: ""AUNGY"" -> not a word.

    ""AXONY"": A(1), X(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> but N is at position 4? We know N cannot be at position 4 (from first guess). So invalid.

    We must not put N at position 4.

    So N must be at position 3? Then the word: A, (letter at 2), N (at 3), (letter at 4), Y.

    Example: ""ALIGN"": A(1), L(2), I(3), G(4), N(5) -> but we need Y at 5, not N. And we have N at 5? This doesn't have Y.

    We need Y at 5.

    So: ""A? ? ? Y"", and the third letter is N? So: A, (letter2), N, (letter4), Y.

    Example: ""ALINY"" -> not a word.

    ""ADENY"" -> E is excluded.

    ""AVIAN"": A(1), V(2), I(3), A(4), N(5) -> but we need Y at 5, and also duplicate A? Not matching.

    This is difficult.

Now, the other option: A at position 4 and N at position 2 or 3.

Option: A at 4 and N at 2:
  Word: ?, N, ?, A, Y

  Example: ""UNLAY"": U(1), N(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5) -> valid word? ""Unlay"" means to untwist. It's a word.

  Letters: U, N, L, A, Y. All distinct and not excluded.

Option: A at 4 and N at 3:
  Word: ?, ?, N, A, Y

  Example: ""LINAY"" -> not a word.

  ""BONAY"" -> not a word.

  ""MANAY"" -> not a word.

  ""DINAY"" -> not a word.

  ""MINAY"" -> not a word.

  ""PINAY"" -> might be a proper noun? Not a common word.

  ""WINAY"" -> not a word.

  So the structure with A at 4 and N at 2 seems more promising: ""UNLAY"".

But let's check if there are other possibilities.

What about A at 1 and N at 3? We had trouble, but let's try again.

Word: A, ?, N, ?, Y

We need a word: A _ N _ Y

Common words: 
  ""AGONY"": A(1), G(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> but N is at position 4? We know N cannot be at position 4. So invalid.

  ""ANNOY"": A(1), N(2), N(3), O(4), Y(5) -> N at 2 and 3? But we are only required to have one N? Actually, we know there is at least one N, but there could be two. However, we are not sure. Also, we are using two N's, which might not be efficient for information.

  But if we use ""annoy"", then we have:
    A at 1 (which is allowed, since A not forbidden at 1) and N at 2 and 3? But we are testing N at 2 and 3. However, we know N is not at position 1 and 4, so 2 and 3 are the only possibilities? But we don't know if there are two N's.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at 1 and N at 3? But then the second letter is free and the fourth letter is free.

  Example: ""ALIGN"" is 5 letters but ends with N, not Y.

  We need to end with Y.

  ""AVIAN"" ends with N.

  ""AXION"" ends with N.

  I'm struggling to find a word with A at 1, N at 3, and Y at 5.

  Let me think: ""AUNTY"": A(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but T is excluded (from guess2: T(x)). So not allowed.

  ""ANGRY"": R excluded.

  ""ANKHY"" not a word.

  So maybe A at 1 and N at 3 is not feasible.

Now, what about A at 4 and N at 3? We tried and couldn't find a common word.

So the best candidate so far is ""UNLAY"": 
  U(1), N(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5)

This satisfies:
  - A is at position 4 (which is allowed because A was not at 4 in previous guesses? Actually, we only know A is not at 2 or 3, so 4 is new and allowed).
  - N is at position 2 (which is allowed because N was not at 1 or 4, and 2 is new).
  - We avoid excluded letters: C, R, E, S, T.
  - We introduce new letters: U, L.

But is ""UNLAY"" a valid word? It means to untwist (as in unlay a rope). It's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try ""INLAY"": 
  I(1), N(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5)

This is a common word (meaning to set in something, like inlaid wood). 

But note: in ""INLAY"", N is at position 2 (allowed) and A at 4 (allowed). 

We haven't used I and L yet.

But we must check if the position for N is allowed: yes, because N was not at 1 or 4, and 2 is new.

Similarly, A at 4 is new.

Also, we avoid excluded letters.

So ""INLAY"" is a good candidate.

Another option: ""UNLAW"" -> not a word? Or ""UNLAY"" is better.

But ""INLAY"" is more common.

We also have the possibility of A at 1 and N at 2? We couldn't find a good word, but let's try again.

Word: A, N, ?, ?, Y

We need two letters in the middle that form a word.

Example: ""ANGRY"" -> R excluded.

""ANGLY"" -> not a word.

""ANKHY"" -> not.

""ANIMY"" -> not.

""ANNUL"" -> doesn't end with Y.

But what about ""ANNOY""? It's a valid word: A(1), N(2), N(3), O(4), Y(5). 

But we are using two N's. Is that acceptable? 

We know the word has at least one N, but it might have two. We don't know. 

If we use ""annoy"", we are testing:
  - A at position 1 (allowed)
  - N at position 2 (allowed) and also at 3 (which we don't know if it's allowed or not, but we haven't tested position 3 for N yet? Actually, we tested N at 1 and 4, but not 2 or 3. So we are testing two positions at once? But if the word has only one N, then one of them will be marked as not present? Actually, the feedback will show:

  If the secret word has only one N, then if we put two N's, one of them will be marked as absent (x) if it's not in the word? But we know the word has at least one N, so one of the N's might be correct and the other wrong? Or if the N is at position 2, then the N at 3 would be absent? 

But we don't know the position of N. So it might be confusing.

To avoid confusion, it's better to use distinct letters. So ""INLAY"" is better.

Another word: ""ALLEY"" -> but we need A at 1? And we have two L's? And we don't have N? We must include N.

So ""INLAY"" seems a solid choice.

We also have ""ONLAY"": which is a variant of inlay? But ""inlay"" is more common.

So I choose ""INLAY"".

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries. We want to maximize information.

""INLAY"" uses I, N, L, A, Y. We know A, N, Y are in the word, so we are testing I and L.

If we get feedback that I or L is not in the word, we learn something.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has more new letters? But we have to include A and N and Y at the end.

Another candidate: ""DAILY"": D(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but A is at position 2? We know A cannot be at position 2 (from the feedback of ""nasty"": A at 2 was marked as '-', meaning it's in the word but not at 2). So we cannot put A at 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at 2. So we should avoid.

Similarly, we cannot put A at 3 or N at 1 or 4.

So ""INLAY"" is good.

Let me confirm the positions for ""INLAY"":
  I at 1: new letter, not tested.
  N at 2: we know N is in the word but not at 1 or 4, so 2 is a new position to test.
  L at 3: new letter.
  A at 4: we know A is in the word but not at 2 or 3, so 4 is new.
  Y at 5: correct and fixed.

So we are testing two new letters (I and L) and two new positions for A and N.

Therefore, we guess ""INLAY"".

<guess>inlay</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, and E are absent (x). A and N are present but in the wrong positions (-), meaning A is not at position 3 and N is not at position 4.
- **Guess 2 (nasty)**: S and T are absent (x). N is present but not at position 1 (-). A is present but not at position 2 (-). Y is correct and in position 5 (✓).

### Key Insights:
1. **Y is fixed at position 5**.
2. **A and N must be included** but cannot be in the following positions:
   - A: Not at position 2 (from ""nasty"") or 3 (from ""crane"").
   - N: Not at position 1 (from ""nasty"") or 4 (from ""crane"").
3. **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, S, T (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
4. **Possible positions for A and N**:
   - A can only be at position 1 or 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are invalid, and 5 is taken by Y).
   - N can only be at position 2 or 3 (since positions 1 and 4 are invalid, and 5 is taken by Y).
5. **New letters to test**: Focus on common unused letters (e.g., I, L, O, U, D, M, P) to maximize information.

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Choose a word with:
  - Y at position 5.
  - A and N in valid positions (A at 1/4, N at 2/3).
  - New letters not yet tested (avoiding C, R, E, S, T).
- Prioritize words that test A and N in new positions while introducing high-frequency letters.

### Selected Guess: ""INLAY""
- **Breakdown**:
  - **I** (position 1): New letter (not tested).
  - **N** (position 2): Valid position for N (not 1 or 4), testing if N is at position 2.
  - **L** (position 3): New letter (not tested).
  - **A** (position 4): Valid position for A (not 2 or 3), testing if A is at position 4.
  - **Y** (position 5): Correct and fixed (✓).
- **Why this word?**
  - Tests A and N in new, untried positions (N at 2, A at 4).
  - Introduces two new common letters (I and L) for additional information.
  - Avoids excluded letters and invalid positions.
  - ""INLAY"" is a valid 5-letter word (meaning to set pieces into a surface).

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while adhering to the constraints.

<guess>inlay</guess>",inlay,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
  Meaning:
    - C, R, E are not in the word.
    - A and N are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

Guess 2: ""nasty"" -> Feedback: N(-) A(-) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)
  Meaning:
    - N is in the word but not at position 1 (since we put it at position 1 and got '-')
    - A is in the word but not at position 2 (since we put it at position 2 and got '-')
    - S and T are not in the word (x)
    - Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter Y at position 5.
2. The secret word contains A and N, but we don't know their positions yet. We know they are not at:
   - A: not at position 3 (from ""crane"") and not at position 2 (from ""nasty"")
   - N: not at position 4 (from ""crane"") and not at position 1 (from ""nasty"")
3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, E, S, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, Y (but only A, N, Y are in the word, and Y is fixed at position 5).

We need to make a third guess that:
- Must have Y at position 5.
- Must include A and N (each exactly once, unless we suspect duplicates, but we don't have evidence for duplicates so we assume single occurrence).
- A cannot be at position 2 or 3.
- N cannot be at position 1 or 4.
- Avoid the letters: C, R, E, S, T.

Possible positions for A: 1, 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are excluded, and position 5 is taken by Y).
Possible positions for N: 2, 3, 5 (but position 5 is Y, so only 2 or 3).

But note: position 5 is fixed for Y, so A and N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, but with constraints.

Specifically:
- A can be at positions 1 or 4 (because not 2 or 3).
- N can be at positions 2 or 3 (because not 1 or 4).

So the word must have:
  Position 1: either A or another letter (but not N because N can't be at 1, and not the excluded letters)
  Position 2: either N or another letter (but not A because A can't be at 2, and not excluded)
  Position 3: either N or another letter (but not A because A can't be at 3, and not excluded)
  Position 4: either A or another letter (but not N because N can't be at 4, and not excluded)
  Position 5: Y

We also need to include both A and N.

So the possibilities for the structure:

Option 1: A at 1 and N at 2 or 3.
Option 2: A at 4 and N at 2 or 3.

We also need to fill the remaining positions with letters that are not excluded and not A, N, Y (since we are assuming no duplicates for now).

Excluded letters: C, R, E, S, T.

We can use other common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We want to maximize information by trying new letters.

Let's try to form words:

First, if A is at position 1 and N at position 2:
  Word: A, N, ?, ?, Y
  The third and fourth positions must be filled with two new letters (not A, N, Y, and not excluded).

  Example: ""ANGRY"" -> A(1), N(2), G(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but R is excluded. Not allowed.

  ""ANGLY"": A(1), N(2), G(3), L(4), Y(5) -> 
      Letters: A, N, G, L, Y. 
      G and L are new and allowed.

  Is ""angly"" a word? Not a common word. ""Angly"" is not valid.

  ""ANDY"" is only 4 letters.

  ""ANKHY"" -> not a word.

  ""ANIMY"" -> not a word.

  ""ANNOY"": A(1), N(2), N(3), O(4), Y(5) -> but duplicate N? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven't seen evidence. Also, we are using N twice, which might not be efficient.

  But note: we have to include A and N, and we are putting N at position 2 and also at 3? That would be two N's. We don't know if the word has two N's. But we only know one N is present from the feedback? Actually, the feedback only told us that there is at least one N. There could be more, but we don't know.

  However, to avoid complexity, let's assume one occurrence for now.

  Alternatively, A at 1 and N at 3:
    Word: A, ?, N, ?, Y

    Example: ""AUNGY"" -> not a word.

    ""AXONY"": A(1), X(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> but N is at position 4? We know N cannot be at position 4 (from first guess). So invalid.

    We must not put N at position 4.

    So N must be at position 3? Then the word: A, (letter at 2), N (at 3), (letter at 4), Y.

    Example: ""ALIGN"": A(1), L(2), I(3), G(4), N(5) -> but we need Y at 5, not N. And we have N at 5? This doesn't have Y.

    We need Y at 5.

    So: ""A? ? ? Y"", and the third letter is N? So: A, (letter2), N, (letter4), Y.

    Example: ""ALINY"" -> not a word.

    ""ADENY"" -> E is excluded.

    ""AVIAN"": A(1), V(2), I(3), A(4), N(5) -> but we need Y at 5, and also duplicate A? Not matching.

    This is difficult.

Now, the other option: A at position 4 and N at position 2 or 3.

Option: A at 4 and N at 2:
  Word: ?, N, ?, A, Y

  Example: ""UNLAY"": U(1), N(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5) -> valid word? ""Unlay"" means to untwist. It's a word.

  Letters: U, N, L, A, Y. All distinct and not excluded.

Option: A at 4 and N at 3:
  Word: ?, ?, N, A, Y

  Example: ""LINAY"" -> not a word.

  ""BONAY"" -> not a word.

  ""MANAY"" -> not a word.

  ""DINAY"" -> not a word.

  ""MINAY"" -> not a word.

  ""PINAY"" -> might be a proper noun? Not a common word.

  ""WINAY"" -> not a word.

  So the structure with A at 4 and N at 2 seems more promising: ""UNLAY"".

But let's check if there are other possibilities.

What about A at 1 and N at 3? We had trouble, but let's try again.

Word: A, ?, N, ?, Y

We need a word: A _ N _ Y

Common words: 
  ""AGONY"": A(1), G(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> but N is at position 4? We know N cannot be at position 4. So invalid.

  ""ANNOY"": A(1), N(2), N(3), O(4), Y(5) -> N at 2 and 3? But we are only required to have one N? Actually, we know there is at least one N, but there could be two. However, we are not sure. Also, we are using two N's, which might not be efficient for information.

  But if we use ""annoy"", then we have:
    A at 1 (which is allowed, since A not forbidden at 1) and N at 2 and 3? But we are testing N at 2 and 3. However, we know N is not at position 1 and 4, so 2 and 3 are the only possibilities? But we don't know if there are two N's.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at 1 and N at 3? But then the second letter is free and the fourth letter is free.

  Example: ""ALIGN"" is 5 letters but ends with N, not Y.

  We need to end with Y.

  ""AVIAN"" ends with N.

  ""AXION"" ends with N.

  I'm struggling to find a word with A at 1, N at 3, and Y at 5.

  Let me think: ""AUNTY"": A(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but T is excluded (from guess2: T(x)). So not allowed.

  ""ANGRY"": R excluded.

  ""ANKHY"" not a word.

  So maybe A at 1 and N at 3 is not feasible.

Now, what about A at 4 and N at 3? We tried and couldn't find a common word.

So the best candidate so far is ""UNLAY"": 
  U(1), N(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5)

This satisfies:
  - A is at position 4 (which is allowed because A was not at 4 in previous guesses? Actually, we only know A is not at 2 or 3, so 4 is new and allowed).
  - N is at position 2 (which is allowed because N was not at 1 or 4, and 2 is new).
  - We avoid excluded letters: C, R, E, S, T.
  - We introduce new letters: U, L.

But is ""UNLAY"" a valid word? It means to untwist (as in unlay a rope). It's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try ""INLAY"": 
  I(1), N(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5)

This is a common word (meaning to set in something, like inlaid wood). 

But note: in ""INLAY"", N is at position 2 (allowed) and A at 4 (allowed). 

We haven't used I and L yet.

But we must check if the position for N is allowed: yes, because N was not at 1 or 4, and 2 is new.

Similarly, A at 4 is new.

Also, we avoid excluded letters.

So ""INLAY"" is a good candidate.

Another option: ""UNLAW"" -> not a word? Or ""UNLAY"" is better.

But ""INLAY"" is more common.

We also have the possibility of A at 1 and N at 2? We couldn't find a good word, but let's try again.

Word: A, N, ?, ?, Y

We need two letters in the middle that form a word.

Example: ""ANGRY"" -> R excluded.

""ANGLY"" -> not a word.

""ANKHY"" -> not.

""ANIMY"" -> not.

""ANNUL"" -> doesn't end with Y.

But what about ""ANNOY""? It's a valid word: A(1), N(2), N(3), O(4), Y(5). 

But we are using two N's. Is that acceptable? 

We know the word has at least one N, but it might have two. We don't know. 

If we use ""annoy"", we are testing:
  - A at position 1 (allowed)
  - N at position 2 (allowed) and also at 3 (which we don't know if it's allowed or not, but we haven't tested position 3 for N yet? Actually, we tested N at 1 and 4, but not 2 or 3. So we are testing two positions at once? But if the word has only one N, then one of them will be marked as not present? Actually, the feedback will show:

  If the secret word has only one N, then if we put two N's, one of them will be marked as absent (x) if it's not in the word? But we know the word has at least one N, so one of the N's might be correct and the other wrong? Or if the N is at position 2, then the N at 3 would be absent? 

But we don't know the position of N. So it might be confusing.

To avoid confusion, it's better to use distinct letters. So ""INLAY"" is better.

Another word: ""ALLEY"" -> but we need A at 1? And we have two L's? And we don't have N? We must include N.

So ""INLAY"" seems a solid choice.

We also have ""ONLAY"": which is a variant of inlay? But ""inlay"" is more common.

So I choose ""INLAY"".

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries. We want to maximize information.

""INLAY"" uses I, N, L, A, Y. We know A, N, Y are in the word, so we are testing I and L.

If we get feedback that I or L is not in the word, we learn something.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has more new letters? But we have to include A and N and Y at the end.

Another candidate: ""DAILY"": D(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but A is at position 2? We know A cannot be at position 2 (from the feedback of ""nasty"": A at 2 was marked as '-', meaning it's in the word but not at 2). So we cannot put A at 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at 2. So we should avoid.

Similarly, we cannot put A at 3 or N at 1 or 4.

So ""INLAY"" is good.

Let me confirm the positions for ""INLAY"":
  I at 1: new letter, not tested.
  N at 2: we know N is in the word but not at 1 or 4, so 2 is a new position to test.
  L at 3: new letter.
  A at 4: we know A is in the word but not at 2 or 3, so 4 is new.
  Y at 5: correct and fixed.

So we are testing two new letters (I and L) and two new positions for A and N.

Therefore, we guess ""INLAY"".

<guess>inlay</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, and E are absent (x). A and N are present but in the wrong positions (-), meaning A is not at position 3 and N is not at position 4.
- **Guess 2 (nasty)**: S and T are absent (x). N is present but not at position 1 (-). A is present but not at position 2 (-). Y is correct and in position 5 (✓).

### Key Insights:
1. **Y is fixed at position 5**.
2. **A and N must be included** but cannot be in the following positions:
   - A: Not at position 2 (from ""nasty"") or 3 (from ""crane"").
   - N: Not at position 1 (from ""nasty"") or 4 (from ""crane"").
3. **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, S, T (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
4. **Possible positions for A and N**:
   - A can only be at position 1 or 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are invalid, and 5 is taken by Y).
   - N can only be at position 2 or 3 (since positions 1 and 4 are invalid, and 5 is taken by Y).
5. **New letters to test**: Focus on common unused letters (e.g., I, L, O, U, D, M, P) to maximize information.

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Choose a word with:
  - Y at position 5.
  - A and N in valid positions (A at 1/4, N at 2/3).
  - New letters not yet tested (avoiding C, R, E, S, T).
- Prioritize words that test A and N in new positions while introducing high-frequency letters.

### Selected Guess: ""INLAY""
- **Breakdown**:
  - **I** (position 1): New letter (not tested).
  - **N** (position 2): Valid position for N (not 1 or 4), testing if N is at position 2.
  - **L** (position 3): New letter (not tested).
  - **A** (position 4): Valid position for A (not 2 or 3), testing if A is at position 4.
  - **Y** (position 5): Correct and fixed (✓).
- **Why this word?**
  - Tests A and N in new, untried positions (N at 2, A at 4).
  - Introduces two new common letters (I and L) for additional information.
  - Avoids excluded letters and invalid positions.
  - ""INLAY"" is a valid 5-letter word (meaning to set pieces into a surface).

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while adhering to the constraints.",Guess 3: inlay -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(✓) L(x) A(-) Y(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A and N are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 3 and 4 respectively).

Since A and N are in the word, we must include them in our next guess, but in different positions.

We also know that the secret word does not contain C, R, or E.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Does not contain C, R, E.
  - Contains A and N.
  - Places A and N in positions different from 3 and 4 (since in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and N at position 4).

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible positions for A and N:
  - A cannot be at position 3.
  - N cannot be at position 4.

We can try to put A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 and N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

But note: we also want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should avoid using letters we know are not in the word (C, R, E).

Let's try to form a word that includes A and N and three new letters.

Example words:
  - ""sandy"": contains S, A, N, D, Y. But note: A is at position 2 (which is new) and N at position 4? Wait, in ""sandy"": 
        S (1), A (2), N (3), D (4), Y (5)
    But in our feedback, N was at position 4 in the first guess and was marked as present but wrong position. 
    Now we are putting N at position 3? That's allowed because it's a different position.

  However, we must check if the word is valid.

But note: we don't know if S, D, Y are in the word or not.

Alternatively, we can try ""adorn"": 
  A (1), D (2), O (3), R (4), N (5) -> but R is not allowed because we know R is not in the word.

We must avoid R.

Another word: ""plain"": 
  P (1), L (2), A (3), I (4), N (5) -> but A is at position 3 again? We know from feedback that A is not at position 3. 
  So we cannot put A at position 3.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

How about ""paint"": 
  P (1), A (2), I (3), N (4), T (5) -> 
    A is at position 2 (new) and N is at position 4? But in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we were told it's in the word but wrong position. 
    So we cannot put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can because the feedback only said it was in the word but not at position 4. 
    However, if we put it again at position 4, we might get the same feedback. But we are allowed to try, but it's inefficient.

We want to test N in a new position. So ideally, we put N in a position that is not 4.

Similarly, A should not be at position 3.

So let's try to put A at position 1 and N at position 5? Or A at position 2 and N at position 1, etc.

Word: ""mania"": 
  M (1), A (2), N (3), I (4), A (5) -> but has duplicate A? Also, we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the secret word might not have duplicates. 
  Moreover, we are not sure about the letters.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" had two different letters (A and N) and they were both present. So the secret word has at least one A and one N.

We should avoid using duplicate letters for now to maximize information.

Another word: ""saint"": 
  S (1), A (2), I (3), N (4), T (5) -> 
    A is at position 2 (new) and N is at position 4 (same as before). 
    We know N is not at position 4, so if we put it again at 4, we expect it to be marked as '-' again? 
    But we want to test N in a new position? 

Alternatively, we can try ""taint"": 
  T (1), A (2), I (3), N (4), T (5) -> duplicate T and N at position 4 again.

Not ideal.

Word: ""nasty"": 
  N (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), Y (5) -> 
    Here, N is at position 1 (new) and A at position 2 (new). 
    This seems good because we are testing both A and N in new positions.

But note: in the first guess, A was at position 3 and now we are putting it at position 2. Similarly, N was at 4 and now at 1.

So ""nasty"" uses:
  N (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), Y (5)

We avoid C, R, E.

This word is valid.

We can also consider ""pants"": 
  P (1), A (2), N (3), T (4), S (5) -> 
    A at 2, N at 3 (which is new because previously N was at 4). 
    This also avoids the known bad positions.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters, but we are using distinct letters.

Both ""nasty"" and ""pants"" are good.

Another option: ""dance"" -> but E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word.

So avoid E.

Let me choose ""nasty"" because it uses common letters and we get to test N at the start and A in the second position.

So our second guess: ""nasty""

We'll see what feedback we get.

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has S, T, or Y, but that's the point of guessing.

So, the next guess is ""nasty"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are not in the word (marked ""x"").
- A and N are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include A and N, but avoid positions 3 and 4 (since A was at position 3 and N at position 4 in ""crane"").
- Exclude C, R, and E entirely.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, Y) and positions to maximize information.

The word ""nasty"" fits these criteria:
- Places A at position 2 (new position) and N at position 1 (new position).
- Introduces S, T, and Y as new letters.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, E) and positions for A and N.

<guess>nasty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(-) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
  Meaning:
    - C, R, E are not in the word.
    - A and N are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

Guess 2: ""nasty"" -> Feedback: N(-) A(-) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)
  Meaning:
    - N is in the word but not at position 1 (since we put it at position 1 and got '-')
    - A is in the word but not at position 2 (since we put it at position 2 and got '-')
    - S and T are not in the word (x)
    - Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter Y at position 5.
2. The secret word contains A and N, but we don't know their positions yet. We know they are not at:
   - A: not at position 3 (from ""crane"") and not at position 2 (from ""nasty"")
   - N: not at position 4 (from ""crane"") and not at position 1 (from ""nasty"")
3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, E, S, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, Y (but only A, N, Y are in the word, and Y is fixed at position 5).

We need to make a third guess that:
- Must have Y at position 5.
- Must include A and N (each exactly once, unless we suspect duplicates, but we don't have evidence for duplicates so we assume single occurrence).
- A cannot be at position 2 or 3.
- N cannot be at position 1 or 4.
- Avoid the letters: C, R, E, S, T.

Possible positions for A: 1, 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are excluded, and position 5 is taken by Y).
Possible positions for N: 2, 3, 5 (but position 5 is Y, so only 2 or 3).

But note: position 5 is fixed for Y, so A and N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, but with constraints.

Specifically:
- A can be at positions 1 or 4 (because not 2 or 3).
- N can be at positions 2 or 3 (because not 1 or 4).

So the word must have:
  Position 1: either A or another letter (but not N because N can't be at 1, and not the excluded letters)
  Position 2: either N or another letter (but not A because A can't be at 2, and not excluded)
  Position 3: either N or another letter (but not A because A can't be at 3, and not excluded)
  Position 4: either A or another letter (but not N because N can't be at 4, and not excluded)
  Position 5: Y

We also need to include both A and N.

So the possibilities for the structure:

Option 1: A at 1 and N at 2 or 3.
Option 2: A at 4 and N at 2 or 3.

We also need to fill the remaining positions with letters that are not excluded and not A, N, Y (since we are assuming no duplicates for now).

Excluded letters: C, R, E, S, T.

We can use other common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We want to maximize information by trying new letters.

Let's try to form words:

First, if A is at position 1 and N at position 2:
  Word: A, N, ?, ?, Y
  The third and fourth positions must be filled with two new letters (not A, N, Y, and not excluded).

  Example: ""ANGRY"" -> A(1), N(2), G(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but R is excluded. Not allowed.

  ""ANGLY"": A(1), N(2), G(3), L(4), Y(5) -> 
      Letters: A, N, G, L, Y. 
      G and L are new and allowed.

  Is ""angly"" a word? Not a common word. ""Angly"" is not valid.

  ""ANDY"" is only 4 letters.

  ""ANKHY"" -> not a word.

  ""ANIMY"" -> not a word.

  ""ANNOY"": A(1), N(2), N(3), O(4), Y(5) -> but duplicate N? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven't seen evidence. Also, we are using N twice, which might not be efficient.

  But note: we have to include A and N, and we are putting N at position 2 and also at 3? That would be two N's. We don't know if the word has two N's. But we only know one N is present from the feedback? Actually, the feedback only told us that there is at least one N. There could be more, but we don't know.

  However, to avoid complexity, let's assume one occurrence for now.

  Alternatively, A at 1 and N at 3:
    Word: A, ?, N, ?, Y

    Example: ""AUNGY"" -> not a word.

    ""AXONY"": A(1), X(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> but N is at position 4? We know N cannot be at position 4 (from first guess). So invalid.

    We must not put N at position 4.

    So N must be at position 3? Then the word: A, (letter at 2), N (at 3), (letter at 4), Y.

    Example: ""ALIGN"": A(1), L(2), I(3), G(4), N(5) -> but we need Y at 5, not N. And we have N at 5? This doesn't have Y.

    We need Y at 5.

    So: ""A? ? ? Y"", and the third letter is N? So: A, (letter2), N, (letter4), Y.

    Example: ""ALINY"" -> not a word.

    ""ADENY"" -> E is excluded.

    ""AVIAN"": A(1), V(2), I(3), A(4), N(5) -> but we need Y at 5, and also duplicate A? Not matching.

    This is difficult.

Now, the other option: A at position 4 and N at position 2 or 3.

Option: A at 4 and N at 2:
  Word: ?, N, ?, A, Y

  Example: ""UNLAY"": U(1), N(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5) -> valid word? ""Unlay"" means to untwist. It's a word.

  Letters: U, N, L, A, Y. All distinct and not excluded.

Option: A at 4 and N at 3:
  Word: ?, ?, N, A, Y

  Example: ""LINAY"" -> not a word.

  ""BONAY"" -> not a word.

  ""MANAY"" -> not a word.

  ""DINAY"" -> not a word.

  ""MINAY"" -> not a word.

  ""PINAY"" -> might be a proper noun? Not a common word.

  ""WINAY"" -> not a word.

  So the structure with A at 4 and N at 2 seems more promising: ""UNLAY"".

But let's check if there are other possibilities.

What about A at 1 and N at 3? We had trouble, but let's try again.

Word: A, ?, N, ?, Y

We need a word: A _ N _ Y

Common words: 
  ""AGONY"": A(1), G(2), O(3), N(4), Y(5) -> but N is at position 4? We know N cannot be at position 4. So invalid.

  ""ANNOY"": A(1), N(2), N(3), O(4), Y(5) -> N at 2 and 3? But we are only required to have one N? Actually, we know there is at least one N, but there could be two. However, we are not sure. Also, we are using two N's, which might not be efficient for information.

  But if we use ""annoy"", then we have:
    A at 1 (which is allowed, since A not forbidden at 1) and N at 2 and 3? But we are testing N at 2 and 3. However, we know N is not at position 1 and 4, so 2 and 3 are the only possibilities? But we don't know if there are two N's.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at 1 and N at 3? But then the second letter is free and the fourth letter is free.

  Example: ""ALIGN"" is 5 letters but ends with N, not Y.

  We need to end with Y.

  ""AVIAN"" ends with N.

  ""AXION"" ends with N.

  I'm struggling to find a word with A at 1, N at 3, and Y at 5.

  Let me think: ""AUNTY"": A(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but T is excluded (from guess2: T(x)). So not allowed.

  ""ANGRY"": R excluded.

  ""ANKHY"" not a word.

  So maybe A at 1 and N at 3 is not feasible.

Now, what about A at 4 and N at 3? We tried and couldn't find a common word.

So the best candidate so far is ""UNLAY"": 
  U(1), N(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5)

This satisfies:
  - A is at position 4 (which is allowed because A was not at 4 in previous guesses? Actually, we only know A is not at 2 or 3, so 4 is new and allowed).
  - N is at position 2 (which is allowed because N was not at 1 or 4, and 2 is new).
  - We avoid excluded letters: C, R, E, S, T.
  - We introduce new letters: U, L.

But is ""UNLAY"" a valid word? It means to untwist (as in unlay a rope). It's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try ""INLAY"": 
  I(1), N(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5)

This is a common word (meaning to set in something, like inlaid wood). 

But note: in ""INLAY"", N is at position 2 (allowed) and A at 4 (allowed). 

We haven't used I and L yet.

But we must check if the position for N is allowed: yes, because N was not at 1 or 4, and 2 is new.

Similarly, A at 4 is new.

Also, we avoid excluded letters.

So ""INLAY"" is a good candidate.

Another option: ""UNLAW"" -> not a word? Or ""UNLAY"" is better.

But ""INLAY"" is more common.

We also have the possibility of A at 1 and N at 2? We couldn't find a good word, but let's try again.

Word: A, N, ?, ?, Y

We need two letters in the middle that form a word.

Example: ""ANGRY"" -> R excluded.

""ANGLY"" -> not a word.

""ANKHY"" -> not.

""ANIMY"" -> not.

""ANNUL"" -> doesn't end with Y.

But what about ""ANNOY""? It's a valid word: A(1), N(2), N(3), O(4), Y(5). 

But we are using two N's. Is that acceptable? 

We know the word has at least one N, but it might have two. We don't know. 

If we use ""annoy"", we are testing:
  - A at position 1 (allowed)
  - N at position 2 (allowed) and also at 3 (which we don't know if it's allowed or not, but we haven't tested position 3 for N yet? Actually, we tested N at 1 and 4, but not 2 or 3. So we are testing two positions at once? But if the word has only one N, then one of them will be marked as not present? Actually, the feedback will show:

  If the secret word has only one N, then if we put two N's, one of them will be marked as absent (x) if it's not in the word? But we know the word has at least one N, so one of the N's might be correct and the other wrong? Or if the N is at position 2, then the N at 3 would be absent? 

But we don't know the position of N. So it might be confusing.

To avoid confusion, it's better to use distinct letters. So ""INLAY"" is better.

Another word: ""ALLEY"" -> but we need A at 1? And we have two L's? And we don't have N? We must include N.

So ""INLAY"" seems a solid choice.

We also have ""ONLAY"": which is a variant of inlay? But ""inlay"" is more common.

So I choose ""INLAY"".

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries. We want to maximize information.

""INLAY"" uses I, N, L, A, Y. We know A, N, Y are in the word, so we are testing I and L.

If we get feedback that I or L is not in the word, we learn something.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that has more new letters? But we have to include A and N and Y at the end.

Another candidate: ""DAILY"": D(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but A is at position 2? We know A cannot be at position 2 (from the feedback of ""nasty"": A at 2 was marked as '-', meaning it's in the word but not at 2). So we cannot put A at 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at 2. So we should avoid.

Similarly, we cannot put A at 3 or N at 1 or 4.

So ""INLAY"" is good.

Let me confirm the positions for ""INLAY"":
  I at 1: new letter, not tested.
  N at 2: we know N is in the word but not at 1 or 4, so 2 is a new position to test.
  L at 3: new letter.
  A at 4: we know A is in the word but not at 2 or 3, so 4 is new.
  Y at 5: correct and fixed.

So we are testing two new letters (I and L) and two new positions for A and N.

Therefore, we guess ""INLAY"".

<guess>inlay</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, and E are absent (x). A and N are present but in the wrong positions (-), meaning A is not at position 3 and N is not at position 4.
- **Guess 2 (nasty)**: S and T are absent (x). N is present but not at position 1 (-). A is present but not at position 2 (-). Y is correct and in position 5 (✓).

### Key Insights:
1. **Y is fixed at position 5**.
2. **A and N must be included** but cannot be in the following positions:
   - A: Not at position 2 (from ""nasty"") or 3 (from ""crane"").
   - N: Not at position 1 (from ""nasty"") or 4 (from ""crane"").
3. **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, S, T (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
4. **Possible positions for A and N**:
   - A can only be at position 1 or 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are invalid, and 5 is taken by Y).
   - N can only be at position 2 or 3 (since positions 1 and 4 are invalid, and 5 is taken by Y).
5. **New letters to test**: Focus on common unused letters (e.g., I, L, O, U, D, M, P) to maximize information.

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Choose a word with:
  - Y at position 5.
  - A and N in valid positions (A at 1/4, N at 2/3).
  - New letters not yet tested (avoiding C, R, E, S, T).
- Prioritize words that test A and N in new positions while introducing high-frequency letters.

### Selected Guess: ""INLAY""
- **Breakdown**:
  - **I** (position 1): New letter (not tested).
  - **N** (position 2): Valid position for N (not 1 or 4), testing if N is at position 2.
  - **L** (position 3): New letter (not tested).
  - **A** (position 4): Valid position for A (not 2 or 3), testing if A is at position 4.
  - **Y** (position 5): Correct and fixed (✓).
- **Why this word?**
  - Tests A and N in new, untried positions (N at 2, A at 4).
  - Introduces two new common letters (I and L) for additional information.
  - Avoids excluded letters and invalid positions.
  - ""INLAY"" is a valid 5-letter word (meaning to set pieces into a surface).

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while adhering to the constraints.

Also, we are using two N\'s, which might not be efficient for information.\n\n  But if we use ""annoy"", then we have:\n    A at 1 (which is allowed, since A not forbidden at 1) and N at 2 and 3? But we are testing N at 2 and 3. However, we know N is not at position 1 and 4, so 2 and 3 are the only possibilities? But we don\'t know if there are two N\'s.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at 1 and N at 3? But then the second letter is free and the fourth letter is free.\n\n  Example: ""ALIGN"" is 5 letters but ends with N, not Y.\n\n  We need to end with Y.\n\n  ""AVIAN"" ends with N.\n\n  ""AXION"" ends with N.\n\n  I\'m struggling to find a word with A at 1, N at 3, and Y at 5.\n\n  Let me think: ""AUNTY"": A(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but T is excluded (from guess2: T(x)).

We tried and couldn\'t find a common word.\n\nSo the best candidate so far is ""UNLAY"": \n  U(1), N(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5)\n\nThis satisfies:\n  - A is at position 4 (which is allowed because A was not at 4 in previous guesses? Actually, we only know A is not at 2 or 3, so 4 is new and allowed).\n  - N is at position 2 (which is allowed because N was not at 1 or 4, and 2 is new).\n  - We avoid excluded letters: C, R, E, S, T.\n  - We introduce new letters: U, L.\n\nBut is ""UNLAY"" a valid word? It means to untwist (as in unlay a rope). It\'s acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""INLAY"": \n  I(1), N(2), L(3), A(4), Y(5)\n\nThis is a common word (meaning to set in something, like inlaid wood). \n\nBut note: in ""INLAY"", N is at position 2 (allowed) and A at 4 (allowed). \n\nWe haven\'t used I and L yet.\n\nBut we must check if the position for N is allowed: yes, because N was not at 1 or 4, and 2 is new.\n\nSimilarly, A at 4 is new.\n\nAlso, we avoid excluded letters.\n\nSo ""INLAY"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother option: ""UNLAW"" -> not a word? Or ""UNLAY"" is better.\n\nBut ""INLAY"" is more common.\n\nWe also have the possibility of A at 1 and N at 2? We couldn\'t find a good word, but let\'s try again.\n\nWord: A, N, ?, ?, Y\n\nWe need two letters in the middle that form a word.\n\nExample: ""ANGRY"" -> R excluded.\n\n""ANGLY"" -> not a word.\n\n""ANKHY"" -> not.\n\n""ANIMY"" -> not.\n\n""ANNUL"" -> doesn\'t end with Y.\n\nBut what about ""ANNOY""? It\'s a valid word: A(1), N(2), N(3), O(4), Y(5). \n\nBut we are using two N\'s. Is that acceptable? \n\nWe know the word has at least one N, but it might have two. We don\'t know. \n\nIf we use ""annoy"", we are testing:\n  - A at position 1 (allowed)\n  - N at position 2 (allowed) and also at 3 (which we don\'t know if it\'s allowed or not, but we haven\'t tested position 3 for N yet? Actually, we tested N at 1 and 4, but not 2 or 3. So we are testing two positions at once? But if the word has only one N, then one of them will be marked as not present? Actually, the feedback will show:\n\n  If the secret word has only one N, then if we put two N\'s, one of them will be marked as absent (x) if it\'s not in the word? But we know the word has at least one N, so one of the N\'s might be correct and the other wrong? Or if the N is at position 2, then the N at 3 would be absent? \n\nBut we don\'t know the position of N. So it might be confusing.\n\nTo avoid confusion, it\'s better to use distinct letters. So ""INLAY"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""ALLEY"" -> but we need A at 1? And we have two L\'s? And we don\'t have N? We must include N.\n\nSo ""INLAY"" seems a solid choice.\n\nWe also have ""ONLAY"": which is a variant of inlay? But ""inlay"" is more common.\n\nSo I choose ""INLAY"".\n\nBut note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries. We want to maximize information.\n\n""INLAY"" uses I, N, L, A, Y. We know A, N, Y are in the word, so we are testing I and L.\n\nIf we get feedback that I or L is not in the word, we learn something.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that has more new letters? But we have to include A and N and Y at the end.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DAILY"": D(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), Y(5) -> but A is at position 2? We know A cannot be at position 2 (from the feedback of ""nasty"": A at 2 was marked as \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not at 2). So we cannot put A at 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not at 2. So we should avoid.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put A at 3 or N at 1 or 4.\n\nSo ""INLAY"" is good.\n\nLet me confirm the positions for ""INLAY"":\n  I at 1: new letter, not tested.\n  N at 2: we know N is in the word but not at 1 or 4, so 2 is a new position to test.\n  L at 3: new letter.\n  A at 4: we know A is in the word but not at 2 or 3, so 4 is new.\n  Y at 5: correct and fixed.\n\nSo we are testing two new letters (I and L) and two new positions for A and N.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""INLAY"".\n\n<guess>inlay</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C, R, and E are absent (x). A and N are present but in the wrong positions (-), meaning A is not at position 3 and N is not at position 4.\n- **Guess 2 (nasty)**: S and T are absent (x). N is present but not at position 1 (-). A is present but not at position 2 (-). Y is correct and in position 5 (✓).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Y is fixed at position 5**.\n2. **A and N must be included** but cannot be in the following positions:\n   - A: Not at position 2 (from ""nasty"") or 3 (from ""crane"").\n   - N: Not at position 1 (from ""nasty"") or 4 (from ""crane"").\n3. **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, S, T (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).\n4. **Possible positions for A and N**:\n   - A can only be at position 1 or 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are invalid, and 5 is taken by Y).\n   - N can only be at position 2 or 3 (since positions 1 and 4 are invalid, and 5 is taken by Y).\n5. **New letters to test**: Focus on common unused letters (e.g., I, L, O, U, D, M, P) to maximize information.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Guess:\n- Choose a word with:\n  - Y at position 5.\n  - A and N in valid positions (A at 1/4, N at 2/3).\n  - New letters not yet tested (avoiding C, R, E, S, T).\n- Prioritize words that test A and N in new positions while introducing high-frequency letters.\n\n### Selected Guess: ""INLAY""\n- **Breakdown**:\n  - **I** (position 1): New letter (not tested).\n  - **N** (position 2): Valid position for N (not 1 or 4), testing if N is at position 2.\n  - **L** (position 3): New letter (not tested).\n  - **A** (position 4): Valid position for A (not 2 or 3), testing if A is at position 4.\n  - **Y** (position 5): Correct and fixed (✓).\n- **Why this word?**\n  - Tests A and N in new, untried positions (N at 2, A at 4).\n  - Introduces two new common letters (I and L) for additional information.\n  - Avoids excluded letters and invalid positions.\n  - ""INLAY"" is a valid 5-letter word (meaning to set pieces into a surface).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while adhering to the constraints.\n\n<guess>inlay</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(-) S(x) T(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: inlay -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(✓) L(x) A(-) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane
  C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
  So: A and N are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively. C, R, E are absent.

Guess 2: nasty
  N(-), A(-), S(x), T(x), Y(✓)
  So: N is present but not at position 1; A is present but not at position 2; S and T are absent; Y is correct at position 5.

Guess 3: inlay
  I(x), N(✓), L(x), A(-), Y(✓)
  So: I and L are absent; N is correct at position 2; A is present but not at position 4; Y is correct at position 5.

Summary of what we know:

1. Y is at position 5 (fixed).
2. N is at position 2 (now confirmed correct!).
3. A is present, but not at position 3 (from guess1), not at position 2 (guess2), not at position 4 (guess3). Therefore, A must be at position 1 (since position 5 is Y and positions 2,3,4 are ruled out for A? Let's check).

Positions for A:
- Position 1: not tested so far? Actually, we tested A at position 3 (guess1), position 2 (guess2), and position 4 (guess3). So position 1 is the only remaining position? Because there are only 5 positions and we ruled out 2,3,4.

Therefore, A must be at position 1.

4. Absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I, L (from all feedbacks).

5. Present letters: A (must be at 1), N (at 2), Y (at 5). So we know positions 1,2,5.

We need to find the word with:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: N
- Position 5: Y
- Then positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters that have not been excluded and are in the word.

But we also know that the word must have exactly 5 distinct letters? Or could there be duplicates? We have not encountered duplicates so far, but we should consider.

However, note that guess3 had I and L absent, and we have no indication of duplicates.

So the secret word starts with A, followed by N, then two letters, and ends with Y: A N _ _ Y.

We need to fill the two middle positions (3 and 4) with letters that are not excluded and that form a valid English word.

Excluded letters: C, R, E, S, T, I, L.

We can choose from the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We have two positions to fill. Moreover, since we have only 3 guesses left (this is the fourth guess), we can try to guess the word directly.

Common letters that might fit: Think of words that start with ""AN"", end with ""Y"", and have two letters in between.

Possible words:

- ""ANGRY"": A(1),N(2),G(3),R(4),Y(5) -> but R is excluded (from guess1: R(x)). Not allowed.

- ""ANNOY"": A(1),N(2),N(3),O(4),Y(5) -> duplicate N? But we already know N at position 2 is correct. If we put N at position 3, then we are suggesting a duplicate. Is that possible? The feedback hasn't indicated duplicates, but it's possible.

However, note that in guess3 we had N at position2 (correct) and also we have A at position1? But we haven't tested duplicate N.

But also, we have excluded many letters. In ""ANNOY"", O is not excluded? We haven't tested O yet.

But we know from the feedback that in guess3 (""inlay"") the letter L was absent, but O is new.

But let me list possible words:

- ""ANNOY"": letters A, N, N, O, Y -> N is repeated.

Valid words without duplicates? 

- ""ANDY"": too short.

- ""ANTY"" or ""ANITY"": not 5 letters.

Common ""AN"" + two letters + ""Y"":

- ""ANGLY"": not a word.

- ""ANKHY"": not a word.

- ""ANOMY"": not a common word. It's a word but rare.

- ""ANYWAY"": too long.

- ""ABBEY"": but doesn't start with AN? We need ""AN___Y"".

Actually, we need exactly two letters between N and Y? The pattern is A N ? ? Y.

So the two middle positions.

Another word: ""ANGRY"" is out because R is excluded.

""ANODY"": not a word.

""ANBIG"": not a word.

We might need to consider duplicates? That is, the word might have duplicate letters? But we only know we have at least one A and one N.

Other words: ""ANVIL"": A(1),N(2),V(3),I(4),L(5) -> but I and L are excluded, and also ends with L, not Y.

No, we need Y at 5.

""ANIMY"": not a word.

What about ""ANNOY""? It is a valid word. And O is not yet excluded.

Also, we have not tested N in other positions? But we know position2 is N, and we are now putting N at position3 as well.

Another word: ""ANOMY"" is a word (meaning social instability), but it ends with Y? ""Anomy"" is 5 letters: A-N-O-M-Y? But then pattern A N O M Y -> positions:1=A,2=N,3=O,4=M,5=Y.

That works without duplication.

But is ""anomy"" common? It is valid.

Similarly, ""AGONY"": A(1),G(2),O(3),N(4),Y(5) -> but we know N is at position2! This word has N at position4? That contradicts our knowledge that N is fixed at position2.

So we cannot have words that don't have N at position2.

Therefore, the word must be A N ? ? Y.

So back to ""ANNOY"" and ""ANOMY"".

However, ""ANOMY"" (A-N-O-M-Y) uses O and M. We haven't tested O or M.

""ANNOY"" (A-N-N-O-Y) uses O and duplicate N.

We can also think of:

- ""ANUHY"": not a word.

- ""ANKHY"": not.

- ""AUNTY"": A(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but here N is at position3? But we know N is at position2! So this is impossible.

Any candidate must have N at position2.

Therefore, the word is ""AN"" followed by two letters and ""Y"".

""ANNOY"" is a valid candidate.

Another candidate? ""ANTHY""? Not a word.

""ANEGY""? Not.

It turns out there aren't many common words that fit.

We also have ""ANGRY"" excluded.

""ANCRY""? Not a word and C excluded.

So ""ANNOY"" seems a strong candidate? But let's check the letters.

In ""ANNOY"": 
- A: position1 (now assumed to be present at1) 
- N: position2 (correct) and also at position3? 
- O: position4 
- Y: position5

But we have duplicate N.

Alternatively, without duplicate? We might have ""ANXAY"" but not a word.

Perhaps ""ANARY"" not a word.

Another possibility: ""ACCOY"" -> excluded C.

So perhaps ""ANNOY"" is a valid guess.

But note: we have a fourth guess. We can try ""ANNOY"" to see.

However, we have another option: we might use a word that tests new letters? Because we know A at position1, N at position2, and Y at position5, we only need letters for positions3 and4.

But we don't know what they are. So if we guess a word that has new letters, we can get feedback.

But if we guess ""ANNOY"", we are forcing a specific word.

We could choose a word that has A at position1, N at position2, Y at position5, and new letters at positions3 and4.

For example, ""ANOMY"" or ""ANOWY"" (not a word), or ""ANJAN"" -> no.

But let me search for words: ""ANGRY"" is excluded.

""ANIMY"" not a word.

""ANBOY""? No.

""ANGKY""? No.

""ANIMY"" no.

Words that start with ""AN"" and end with ""Y"": there are not many. I recall ""annoy"", ""antsy"", but ""antsy"" has S and T? Excluded.

""ANGLY"" not a word.

""ANKLE"" not ending with Y.

So without duplication, we have ""ANOMY"" (which is valid).

Another one: ""ANFGY"" no.

Perhaps ""ANORAK"" is 6 letters.

So feasible choices: ""ANNOY"" and ""ANOMY"".

We'll make a guess.

But note: in guess3 we had 'A' at position4 and got '-' meaning A is in the word but not at4. And now we are putting A at position1? Position1 hasn't been tested for A? Actually, we have not tested A at position1 explicitly, but we deduced it must be at1 because all other positions are ruled out.

So it's safe.

Similarly, if we assume no duplicates, then ""ANOMY"".

But ""ANNOY"" is more common? Yes.

We have another important point: in guess1, we had N at position4 and it was absent? Actually, guess1: N was marked as wrong position (which means present). Then we tested N at position2 and it was correct. So if we use ""ANNOY"", then position3 is N? We don't know if the word has another N? But that's possible.

To test, we can guess ""ANNOY"" and see.

But we want to be efficient? We have three guesses left, so we can guess one of them.

Alternatively, we don't have to guess the word directly? We can test new letters? But we only have two positions (3 and4) to find.

But for maximum information? Since we have two letters to test and only two positions, we might as well guess a valid word.

But we can choose a word with letters that are common and not tested.

For example, ""ANDOY"" not a word.

So between ""ANOMY"" and ""ANNOY"", I think ""ANNOY"" is more common and thus more likely.

Therefore, we will guess ""ANNOY"".

But note: we know that A, N, Y are in place? And we need positions3 and4.

But in ""ANNOY"", we have N at position3? So if the secret word is not ""ANNOY"", we might get feedback.

Alternatively, we could test a word with new letters? But which word? For example, ""AN_GY"" with a letter G? But we need a valid word.

""ANGOY""? Not valid.

""ANURY""? Not.

So I think ""ANNOY"" is the best guess.

But let us check: we have letters excluded: C,R,E,S,T,I,L.

So the word ""ANNOY"" uses N (again). The feedback for guess3 had L and I absent? And ""ANNOY"" has only A,N,O,Y? So letters A,N,O,Y.

We don't know if O is in the word.

Now, for the fourth guess: we are guessing ""ANNOY"".

If it is correct, we win. Otherwise, we get feedback.

The only other common word I can think of is ""ANOMY"".

To be safe, we can guess ""ANNOY"".

So let's go with ""ANNOY"".
</think>
Based on the cumulative feedback from previous guesses:

- **Y is confirmed at position 5** (✓ in ""nasty"" and ""inlay"").
- **N is confirmed at position 2** (✓ in ""inlay"").
- **A is present** but ruled out of positions 2, 3, and 4 (from ""-"" in ""nasty,"" ""crane,"" and ""inlay"").
  - Given only position 1 remains untested for A, A must be at position 1.
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, S, T, I, L (all ""x"" in feedback).
- **Unknown positions**: 3 and 4 need to be filled with letters not excluded.

### Deduced Secret Word Structure:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: Unknown letter (not C, R, E, S, T, I, L)
- Position 4: Unknown letter (not C, R, E, S, T, I, L)
- Position 5: Y

Thus, the secret word must start with ""AN"", end with ""Y"", and use new letters for the middle. Possible words include ""ANNOY"" (common) or rarer options like ""ANOMY"". After testing:
- ""ANNOY"" fits the criteria: A at 1, N at 2, N at 3 (possible duplicate), O at 4 (new letter), Y at 5.
- O is a high-frequency vowel not yet tested, maximizing information for future guesses if incorrect.

This guess adheres to all constraints and leverages the confirmed positions while testing for duplicate N.

<guess>annoy</guess>",annoy,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane
  C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
  So: A and N are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively. C, R, E are absent.

Guess 2: nasty
  N(-), A(-), S(x), T(x), Y(✓)
  So: N is present but not at position 1; A is present but not at position 2; S and T are absent; Y is correct at position 5.

Guess 3: inlay
  I(x), N(✓), L(x), A(-), Y(✓)
  So: I and L are absent; N is correct at position 2; A is present but not at position 4; Y is correct at position 5.

Summary of what we know:

1. Y is at position 5 (fixed).
2. N is at position 2 (now confirmed correct!).
3. A is present, but not at position 3 (from guess1), not at position 2 (guess2), not at position 4 (guess3). Therefore, A must be at position 1 (since position 5 is Y and positions 2,3,4 are ruled out for A? Let's check).

Positions for A:
- Position 1: not tested so far? Actually, we tested A at position 3 (guess1), position 2 (guess2), and position 4 (guess3). So position 1 is the only remaining position? Because there are only 5 positions and we ruled out 2,3,4.

Therefore, A must be at position 1.

4. Absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I, L (from all feedbacks).

5. Present letters: A (must be at 1), N (at 2), Y (at 5). So we know positions 1,2,5.

We need to find the word with:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: N
- Position 5: Y
- Then positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters that have not been excluded and are in the word.

But we also know that the word must have exactly 5 distinct letters? Or could there be duplicates? We have not encountered duplicates so far, but we should consider.

However, note that guess3 had I and L absent, and we have no indication of duplicates.

So the secret word starts with A, followed by N, then two letters, and ends with Y: A N _ _ Y.

We need to fill the two middle positions (3 and 4) with letters that are not excluded and that form a valid English word.

Excluded letters: C, R, E, S, T, I, L.

We can choose from the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We have two positions to fill. Moreover, since we have only 3 guesses left (this is the fourth guess), we can try to guess the word directly.

Common letters that might fit: Think of words that start with ""AN"", end with ""Y"", and have two letters in between.

Possible words:

- ""ANGRY"": A(1),N(2),G(3),R(4),Y(5) -> but R is excluded (from guess1: R(x)). Not allowed.

- ""ANNOY"": A(1),N(2),N(3),O(4),Y(5) -> duplicate N? But we already know N at position 2 is correct. If we put N at position 3, then we are suggesting a duplicate. Is that possible? The feedback hasn't indicated duplicates, but it's possible.

However, note that in guess3 we had N at position2 (correct) and also we have A at position1? But we haven't tested duplicate N.

But also, we have excluded many letters. In ""ANNOY"", O is not excluded? We haven't tested O yet.

But we know from the feedback that in guess3 (""inlay"") the letter L was absent, but O is new.

But let me list possible words:

- ""ANNOY"": letters A, N, N, O, Y -> N is repeated.

Valid words without duplicates? 

- ""ANDY"": too short.

- ""ANTY"" or ""ANITY"": not 5 letters.

Common ""AN"" + two letters + ""Y"":

- ""ANGLY"": not a word.

- ""ANKHY"": not a word.

- ""ANOMY"": not a common word. It's a word but rare.

- ""ANYWAY"": too long.

- ""ABBEY"": but doesn't start with AN? We need ""AN___Y"".

Actually, we need exactly two letters between N and Y? The pattern is A N ? ? Y.

So the two middle positions.

Another word: ""ANGRY"" is out because R is excluded.

""ANODY"": not a word.

""ANBIG"": not a word.

We might need to consider duplicates? That is, the word might have duplicate letters? But we only know we have at least one A and one N.

Other words: ""ANVIL"": A(1),N(2),V(3),I(4),L(5) -> but I and L are excluded, and also ends with L, not Y.

No, we need Y at 5.

""ANIMY"": not a word.

What about ""ANNOY""? It is a valid word. And O is not yet excluded.

Also, we have not tested N in other positions? But we know position2 is N, and we are now putting N at position3 as well.

Another word: ""ANOMY"" is a word (meaning social instability), but it ends with Y? ""Anomy"" is 5 letters: A-N-O-M-Y? But then pattern A N O M Y -> positions:1=A,2=N,3=O,4=M,5=Y.

That works without duplication.

But is ""anomy"" common? It is valid.

Similarly, ""AGONY"": A(1),G(2),O(3),N(4),Y(5) -> but we know N is at position2! This word has N at position4? That contradicts our knowledge that N is fixed at position2.

So we cannot have words that don't have N at position2.

Therefore, the word must be A N ? ? Y.

So back to ""ANNOY"" and ""ANOMY"".

However, ""ANOMY"" (A-N-O-M-Y) uses O and M. We haven't tested O or M.

""ANNOY"" (A-N-N-O-Y) uses O and duplicate N.

We can also think of:

- ""ANUHY"": not a word.

- ""ANKHY"": not.

- ""AUNTY"": A(1), U(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but here N is at position3? But we know N is at position2! So this is impossible.

Any candidate must have N at position2.

Therefore, the word is ""AN"" followed by two letters and ""Y"".

""ANNOY"" is a valid candidate.

Another candidate? ""ANTHY""? Not a word.

""ANEGY""? Not.

It turns out there aren't many common words that fit.

We also have ""ANGRY"" excluded.

""ANCRY""? Not a word and C excluded.

So ""ANNOY"" seems a strong candidate? But let's check the letters.

In ""ANNOY"": 
- A: position1 (now assumed to be present at1) 
- N: position2 (correct) and also at position3? 
- O: position4 
- Y: position5

But we have duplicate N.

Alternatively, without duplicate? We might have ""ANXAY"" but not a word.

Perhaps ""ANARY"" not a word.

Another possibility: ""ACCOY"" -> excluded C.

So perhaps ""ANNOY"" is a valid guess.

But note: we have a fourth guess. We can try ""ANNOY"" to see.

However, we have another option: we might use a word that tests new letters? Because we know A at position1, N at position2, and Y at position5, we only need letters for positions3 and4.

But we don't know what they are. So if we guess a word that has new letters, we can get feedback.

But if we guess ""ANNOY"", we are forcing a specific word.

We could choose a word that has A at position1, N at position2, Y at position5, and new letters at positions3 and4.

For example, ""ANOMY"" or ""ANOWY"" (not a word), or ""ANJAN"" -> no.

But let me search for words: ""ANGRY"" is excluded.

""ANIMY"" not a word.

""ANBOY""? No.

""ANGKY""? No.

""ANIMY"" no.

Words that start with ""AN"" and end with ""Y"": there are not many. I recall ""annoy"", ""antsy"", but ""antsy"" has S and T? Excluded.

""ANGLY"" not a word.

""ANKLE"" not ending with Y.

So without duplication, we have ""ANOMY"" (which is valid).

Another one: ""ANFGY"" no.

Perhaps ""ANORAK"" is 6 letters.

So feasible choices: ""ANNOY"" and ""ANOMY"".

We'll make a guess.

But note: in guess3 we had 'A' at position4 and got '-' meaning A is in the word but not at4. And now we are putting A at position1? Position1 hasn't been tested for A? Actually, we have not tested A at position1 explicitly, but we deduced it must be at1 because all other positions are ruled out.

So it's safe.

Similarly, if we assume no duplicates, then ""ANOMY"".

But ""ANNOY"" is more common? Yes.

We have another important point: in guess1, we had N at position4 and it was absent? Actually, guess1: N was marked as wrong position (which means present). Then we tested N at position2 and it was correct. So if we use ""ANNOY"", then position3 is N? We don't know if the word has another N? But that's possible.

To test, we can guess ""ANNOY"" and see.

But we want to be efficient? We have three guesses left, so we can guess one of them.

Alternatively, we don't have to guess the word directly? We can test new letters? But we only have two positions (3 and4) to find.

But for maximum information? Since we have two letters to test and only two positions, we might as well guess a valid word.

But we can choose a word with letters that are common and not tested.

For example, ""ANDOY"" not a word.

So between ""ANOMY"" and ""ANNOY"", I think ""ANNOY"" is more common and thus more likely.

Therefore, we will guess ""ANNOY"".

But note: we know that A, N, Y are in place? And we need positions3 and4.

But in ""ANNOY"", we have N at position3? So if the secret word is not ""ANNOY"", we might get feedback.

Alternatively, we could test a word with new letters? But which word? For example, ""AN_GY"" with a letter G? But we need a valid word.

""ANGOY""? Not valid.

""ANURY""? Not.

So I think ""ANNOY"" is the best guess.

But let us check: we have letters excluded: C,R,E,S,T,I,L.

So the word ""ANNOY"" uses N (again). The feedback for guess3 had L and I absent? And ""ANNOY"" has only A,N,O,Y? So letters A,N,O,Y.

We don't know if O is in the word.

Now, for the fourth guess: we are guessing ""ANNOY"".

If it is correct, we win. Otherwise, we get feedback.

The only other common word I can think of is ""ANOMY"".

To be safe, we can guess ""ANNOY"".

So let's go with ""ANNOY"".Based on the cumulative feedback from previous guesses:

- **Y is confirmed at position 5** (✓ in ""nasty"" and ""inlay"").
- **N is confirmed at position 2** (✓ in ""inlay"").
- **A is present** but ruled out of positions 2, 3, and 4 (from ""-"" in ""nasty,"" ""crane,"" and ""inlay"").
  - Given only position 1 remains untested for A, A must be at position 1.
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, S, T, I, L (all ""x"" in feedback).
- **Unknown positions**: 3 and 4 need to be filled with letters not excluded.

### Deduced Secret Word Structure:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: Unknown letter (not C, R, E, S, T, I, L)
- Position 4: Unknown letter (not C, R, E, S, T, I, L)
- Position 5: Y

Thus, the secret word must start with ""AN"", end with ""Y"", and use new letters for the middle. Possible words include ""ANNOY"" (common) or rarer options like ""ANOMY"". After testing:
- ""ANNOY"" fits the criteria: A at 1, N at 2, N at 3 (possible duplicate), O at 4 (new letter), Y at 5.
- O is a high-frequency vowel not yet tested, maximizing information for future guesses if incorrect.

This guess adheres to all constraints and leverages the confirmed positions while testing for duplicate N.",Guess 4: annoy -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(✓) N(✓) O(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
